Peculiar and Characteristic Address of the
Permanent Presiding Officer Causes
Commotion in the Convention.
Machinery of the People's Party Placed in the
Hands of the Democracy, Which Prob
ably Means an Indorsement of
Bryan or Fusion.
Beonnie of Its shameful desertion by its leaders and because of tlie resulting
lack ot organization, coupled with a thorough, organisation on the part of the
Democrats, and the Populists' tiesitance, the Populist Convention wu captured
to-day by the Democracy.
The election of Senator Allen of Nebraska as chairman puts the machinery of
the People's purty altogether in the hand* of tbe Democracy, who will hold It as
they will, aud who under the mask of Populist* will indorse Bryan to-mmrow, or
should that be inexpedient, they will make a fusion of the electoral ticket, tbe
object of rith-r procedure being the election of Bryan and the retention of the
offices of the Nation in the hands of Democrats
After the adjournment of the convention last night the middle-of-the-road
men held an indignation meeting at the Texas headquarters In the Southern Hotel.
The opinion was fully expressed that fusion would put the Southern Populists into
the unmerciful hands of the Southern Democracy.
FIRST TEST OF STRENGTH.
Bryan Forces Win the Preliminary
Skirmish by > the Defeat of
Campion for Chairman. ";
ST. LOUIS. Mo., July 23.â 1t was not
till late in the evening that any substan
tial progress was made by the People's
party convention. All the morning and
afternoon were frittered away in disputes
over contested . seats and similar trivial
nastier*. The business- O7 the -convention
was further much '-Hampered -by the lack
of familiarity with parliamentary law
with which both the temporary presiding
officers seemed equally afflicted.
It was nearly 8 o'clock when a decisive
test of strength between the Bryan and
anti-Bryan forces was brought about. It
came up on the report of the committee
on permanent organization. The Bryan
men named Senator Allen of Nebraska for
permanent chairman. The middle-of-the
road and anti-Bryan men united upon
James E. Campion of Maine, stated to be
one of the ablest parliamentarians in the
body. On a call of States the Bryan men
earned the day by a decisive vote of 758
to 564.
The middle-of-the-road men yielded
gracefully, "Cyclone" Davis, the â¢ most
active opponent of Mr. Bryan, introducing
Senator Allen to the convention. The
permanent chairman soon restored order
to the proceedings and pushed them along,
previously making a characteristic speech
of an hour or more duration.
The committee on rules : reported in
favor of limiting the nominating speeches
to-morrow to ten minutes tor proposers
and five minutes for seconders.
After some little opposition a committee
of conference was authorized to meet a
similar committee appointed by the Silver
party's convention and at 10:08 p. m. the
Populists adjourned until to-morrow when
they may possibly : succeed in adopting a
platform, nominating a ticket and ad
journing.
SECOND DAY'S STRUGGLE.
Some Music and Cheers While the
Report of the Credentials Com
mittee Is Awaited.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., July 23.â The day
opened clear and pleasant as far as the
weather was concerned, but not so clear
and pleasant as far as the delegates to the
Populist Convention were concerned.
Both the Bryan and anti-Bryan men came
up determined and defiant. Both sides
claim to have the victory, but neither side
could prove its claims. It was generally
admitted that the first test vote would be
on the report of the credential committee,
and that until that vote was taken it would
be impossible to properly gauge the
strength of the two factions.
The delegates were prompt in assem
bling, ana Chairman Butler called the
convention to order at 11 minutes past 10
o'clock.
At that time the body of the ball was
about two-thirds full, although there were
probably not 200 persons present in the
visitors' gallery. The convention was
opened with prayer by Rev. Mr. Smith.
The chairman announced that the first
thing in order was the report of the cre
dentials committee.
He called for the report of the committee
on credentials, but the report was not
ready. Then it was ordered that the roll
of States be called for members of the
committee on permanent organization,
and this was done.
While this was in progress the delegates
liegan to take off their coats and vests, as
the heat had become very oppressive.
After the selection of the committee on
permanent organization bad been made
the committee uu resolutions was ap
pointed, and both committees retired for
consultation.
While the convention was waiting for
the return of the committees a delegate
from Oklahoma took the platform and en
tertained the members with a song. He
was followed by Mrs. Pennington of Ark
ansas, who was introduced by Delegate
George T. Gother of Alabama and who
sang a Populist song.

over the hall was , caused by the irruption
of a small party of Texas delegates, headed
by two bearing | a banner inscribed
"Middle- of- thÂ« - road, straight Populist
ticket." The majority of delegates rose and
cheered, shouted and waved hats ana fans.
The spectators in the galleries joined in
the shouting and cheering.
Wash burn of 'â â  Massachusetts offered the
following resolution:
Whereas, We are all Populists, and whereas,
we deprecate the attack which has appeared
in some TJÂ«wÂ»pÂ»penÂ» that there li a disposition
on the part of some of thin convention not to
abide by the action of the convention; there
fore, â¢â¢*â :.â  ' : '."_. , ; Â_ t i;.'; v v'Vi .--â  .. ,
â  Resolved, That we repudiate all such utter
ances as are reflections upon the fidelity of the
members of this convention of 'â : the "People's
party.
Strong opposition immediately devel
oped to this motion on the part of dele
gates from thn Southern States, and the
point of order was made that the conven
tion, not being yet permanently organized,
the motion was not a proper one.
About this time Eagene V. Debs entered
the convention and was greeted with ap
plause.
A motion by Delegate Crawford of {Kan
sas that delegates of the silver convention
be admitted on their presenting their
badges was received with hisses and shouts
of "No! No!" It was modified by
making it apply only to the galleries, but
the sergeant-at-arms interposed the objec
tion that all the seats in the galleries had

been assigned on the tickets issued, and he
said that there were counterfeit badges out
besides. The chairman ruled the motion
out of order on the ground that it would
violate the contract made with the busi
ness men of St. Louis. The ruling was
loudly applauded.
This was followed by a number of mo
tions, and the chair became involved In a
hopeless parliamentary tangle, from which
he finally extricated bimt-elf by declaring
the motion tabled.
Tt was announced that the Committee
on Credentials would not be able to report
until 3p. m. A motion was at once made
to take a recess until that hour, bat in-

stantly cries of "No! No!" were heard in
all parts of the nail, and for a while there
was much confusion.
Finally, however, the motion prevailed,
and the contention took a recess until
3 p. it.
PERMANENT ORGANIZATION
Senator Allen of Nebraska Defeats
Campeon of Maine for the
Chairmanship.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 23.â The conven
tion reassembled during the hottest por
tion of an oppressively hot day. It was
little wonder then that moat of the dele
gates set aside all idea of personal d'gnity
or of the proprieties of the occasion and
divested themselves of coats, vests and
shirt collars. Tne committee on credentials
was still unready, and the services of the
band had to be called into requisition.
It was half-pan 3 when Senator Butler
called the convention to order and stated
that the committee on credentials was
prepared to make a partial report. There
upon Mr. Wardall of California, chairman
of the committee, submitted a majority
report, recommending that the delegates
be recognized in all the uncontested cases
â that in the cases of the first seven
Illinois Congressional districts both con
testants and contestees be seated, |with
a half vote, and that, in the. case of Colo
rado, the delegates known as the Patter
son delegates be tatted.
Minority reports, the chairman stated,
would be submitted in these cases.
That part of the report for the admission
of delegates whose seats were uncontested
was agreed to.
Mr. Patterson of Colorado said the rea
son why it was desired to take tip the
Colorado case first was becanse this was
the only case where a whole State delega
tion was contested and Colorado had 45
good Populists who desired to be heard. .
The Colorado case was then taken no.
A Kansas delegate moved that the Pat
terson delegates be seated.
A delegate made a protest against acting
on the Colorado case until the minority
report on that case could be presented to
the convention. That minority report
was not yet ready. Tne protest was of no
avail and it was ordered that discussion be
confined to fifteen minutes for each side.
Mr. Patterson of Colorado, at the request
of the delegations from Texas and Georgia,
moved that tbe Colorado case be post
poned for one hoar, and t'uis was agreed
to.
The Illinois case was taken up. The re
port of the majority declares that the Tay
lor delegates from Cook County, Hi., are
not entitled to the seats and that the con
testants arc. The minority report is in
favor of the Taylor delegates.
Mr. Moran of Nebraska moved the adop
tion of the minority report and Mr. Den
ning of Virginia moved the adoption of
the majority report. Fifteen minntes on
each side was allowed for the discussion of
the Illinois case, the question bein^ first
on the adoption of the minority report.
Mr. Palmer of Illinois opened the dis
cussion in support of tbe minority report
and in favor of seating the Taylor dele*
gates. The contestants, he said, repre
sented only a certain element in Chicago.
Some delegates intimated that tbe cer
tain element in Chicago alluded to by Mr.
Palmer was the anarchistic element, but
Mr. Palmer disavowed this.
The majority report was defended by C.
8. Darrow of Illinois, the lawyer who' de
fended Eugene V. Debs. The case, he tie
clared, had been carefully considered last
nijjht by the committee on credentials and
the decision of the committee was an
honest and fair one. No one had yet been
heard to give a reason why that decision
should not stand.
Jerry Simpson of Kansas spoke in favor
of tlie minority report. He declared the
majority had made no discussion as to
the equities of the case, but had simply
recommended a compromise to give both
sets seats. This was not justice. If the
Taylor delegates were entitled to the seats
they should have them, and if the con
testants were entitled to the seata they
should have them. [Applause.]
The majority report was advocated by
Mr. Morton of Chicago, although he said
he was in tbe condition of the preacher
who, when asked why he did not preach
sermons upon heaven and hell, said:
"Well, brethren, I have got friends in both
places and do not want to say anything
againat them." [Laughter] So in this
case both the contestants and contestees
were his friends and the best way was to
, seat both sets, as proposed, and give them
| half votes.
Mr. Maxwell, chairman of the State
committee of Illinois, advocated the mi
nority report and gave a sketch of the dif
ficulty between the two factions in Cook
County.
Mr. Haieht of West Virginia, a member
of the committee on credentials, defended
the majority report The vote was taken
on the minority report â that tbe Taylor
delegates are entitled to the seatsâ and
the rollcali of States was called.
The vote was taken in the most extraor
dinary manner. Instead of voting aye or
no on the question before them â the adop
tion of the minority report â most of tne
delegates voted upon both reports at the
same time.
In this haphazard way the sense of the
convention was reached, and it was found
that there were cast: For tne minority re
port, seating the Taylor delegates from
Cook County, 642 votes; for the majority
report, seating both delegations with a
half rote, 665 votes.
Tnis result was announced by the chair
(Mr. Washburu of Massachusetts, who
bad temporarily relieved Senator Butler)
amid a scene of great confusion. It was
stated by the chair, in reply to a question,
that the Illinois delegation bad voted on
their own case, though no one had heard
Illinois called. It was incidentally dis
closed during the rollcali that the vote of
Louisiana had been increased by the com
mittee on credentials from fifteen to thirty
two without any report being made in re
gard thereto. The rellcall also gave public
information for the first time of the num
ber of votes assigned each State under the
elastic rules of the convention.
The voting strength of each State was
as follows: Alabama 54, Arkansas 22, Cali
fornia 32, Colorado 45, Connecticut 7,
Delaware 3, Florida 9, Georgia 61, Idaho
7, Illinois 54, Indiana 30, .lowa 27, Kansas
92, Kentucky 26, Louisiana 32, Maine 9,
Maryland 9, Massachusetts 21, Michigan
30, Minnesota 37, Mississippi IS, Missouri
38, Montana 1, Nebraska 57, Nevada not
represented, New Hampshire 4, New Jer
sey 12, New York 44, North Carolina 95,
North Dakota 12, Ohio 49, Oregon 14,
Pennsylvania 38, Rhode Island 4, South
Carolina not represented, South Dakota
17, Tennessee 77, Texas 103, Utah 5, Ver
mont 2, Virginia 53, Washington 16, West
Virginia 8, Wisconsin 24, Wyoming 7,
Alaska and Arizona not represented, Dis
trict of Columbia 6, New Mexico 5, Okla
homa 9, Indian Territory 6.
An Illinois delegate challenged the cor
rectness of the tally and demanded that
the vote be verified and the chairman
gave orders to that effect. When the sec
retary recapitulated the vote some of the
figures were found to have been changed
from the original announcement, the sec
retary stating that this had been done at
the request of the delegations before the
result was proclaimed.
''But you never announced it to us,"
shouted a delegate.
The challenge was eventually withdrawn
and the majority report was declared
adopted, seating both delegations from
Cook County.
The vote having been announced the
Illinois delegates withdrew for conference.
The next contest was that from the
State of Missouri, but the contestants
withdrew their claim. The next contest
was that from the State of Wisconsin.
Five minutes was allowed to each side for
the presentation of its case and after con
siderable talking the minority report (to
seat Cole instead of Isaacs) was voted
down and the majority report (giving the
â¢eat to Isaacs) was adopted.
Laic Fence remaning that all the con
tests had pow been disposed of, said it was
full time to have a permanent organiza
tion of the Convention, and moved that a
special committee be appointed to wait on
the committee on permanent organiza
tion and ask it to report its action, but on
being informed 'hat the committee was
ready to report he withdrew his motion
and inquired where the committee was
il at." [Lauebter.]
The report from the committee on or
ganization was about to be presented, when
points of order were made that the com
mittee on credentials had the right of way
until its full report was made. The chair
man (Mr. Wnshburn of Massachusetts)
overruled these objections and amid up
roar announced that Mr. Cox of Virginia,
chairman of the committee on permanent
organization, had the floor. Mr. Cox
stated the recommendations of the com
mittee, the name of Senator Allen of
Nebraska being reported as permanent
chairman. [Loua and prolonged cheers.]

Poll of the Delegates Shows a Large Number
of Republican Bolters in the
Convention.
Eloquent Orators Tell Why They Ar,e Found in
the White-Metal Camp and Object to
Further Retarding of Bryan's
Indorsement.
The National Silver Convention transacted no business whatever to-day.
Morning and afternoon sessions were held. Both were well attended by delegates
and visitors.
The interest of the day centered in the prospective action of the Populists
relative to the indorsement of Bryan. As there was no report forthcoming from
the conference committee appointed yesterday to co-operate with a like com
mtteee from the PopuliÂ»t Convention, the day dragged along slowly and
uneventfully.
Several vigorous speeches were delivered by silver-tongued orators, and a poll
was taken of the political faith of the delegates previous to the time of their join
ing the National Silver party. It showed a tremendously large secession from the
Republican ranks. Many of the delegates declared their unyielding fidelity to
the party of Lincoln on all questions apart from that of National finance.
The silver delegates are rejoicing to-night over the selection ot Senator Allen
of Nebraska, a Bryan supporter, as permanent chairman of the Populist Conven
tion They regard it as a victory for their cause and an indication of the promised
triumph of Bryan. Regarding the stubbornness of the middle-of-the-road Popu
lists, and especially the passion and steadfastness displayed by the "Texas steers,"
as the delegates from the Lnne Star State are sometimes called, the silver men
angrily declare that they are inclined to think that the wheel factory in St. Louis
is now running overtime. FKANK McGUJBE.
MORNING PROCEEDINGS.
The Mention of Bryan's Name
Causes Tumultuous Applause
by White-Metal Men.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., Jaly 23,âThe delegates
to the Silver convention were slow in
assembling this morning. Members of the
committee appointed yesterday to confer
with the Populists were, however, early
on hand and held a caucus back oi the
chairman's desk, while the nail n as slowly
tilling with delegates.
It was 10:30 wuen the convention was
called to order by Chairman St. John.
A motion was made and carried that a
committee on ways and means be ap
pointed. Newlands made the motion,
explaining that he understood that the ex
penses of the convention had not been pro
vided for, and a committee was necessary
for that purpose.
Chairman St. John then introduced to
the convention its vice-chairman, Hon.
Charles A. Towne of Minnesota, who re
ceived great aoplause.
Mr. Towne said in part:
The situation of our affairs is most grave.
| Men long entrusted with power have come to
I regard themselves as the source of it and their
own seitish advantage as the proper object of
it. livery instrumentality that could minister
to it has been pressed into service. Industrial,
social and political forces have been adroitly
used, not only to bestow rich results upon
the manipulators, but to give the process ail
the appearance of a natural and orderly evolu
tion. Laws have been compelled to speak the
will of a class instead of the fiat of the people.
Legislatures and administrations have been
puppets, and recently, for the first time in the
history of our institutions, the tide of suspicion
has even risen about the judiciary and threat
ens to undermine the very bulwark of the con
stitution, while the press, by the sacrifices and
through the wisdom of the fathers made free.

as the chief guaranty of liberty, has, in a great
measure, forgotten its noDle traditions and beÂ«
come the pliant instrument of oppression.
sj But the hour of reformation Is.at hand. We
are in the vortex of great events. We ara
making history. We are returning to the first
j principles;. ot our Government, and on every
side are l seen the portent* of ,the impending
change.; JOne month ago in' this City the repre
sentatives of a great and "dominant party met
in convention, and for the first time in this or
any other country a great party declared in
favor of the single gold standard. I make
bold' to, say. that, in doing so | that ! conven
tion did violence . to the opinions lof the great
majority of its constituents. , The bold and
bald declaration for the gold standard has had
certain wonderful ; results. Events and agita
tion had gradually prepared the public mind,
until it was in a condition like that of certain
chemical solutions that need only the addition
of a single ingredient to cause the crystalliza
tion of the whole mass. The declaration did it.
: Under circumstances whose solemnity and
izapresslveness were ' never surpassed, a num
ber of members of that convention, led by the
grand old man of Colorado, regretfully but de
terminedly severed the. bonds of party and
followed their convictions into the freedom
and independence of original citizenship.
Meantime events were developing rapidly In
; the Democratic party, and when its great con
vention met in the city of Chicago a large
majority wrb found to be [ against the policy
that had captured its great rival and had once
counted on capturing it also. Fortunate
Democracy, to have been the beneficiary of a
rebirth of Americanism! And happy gold and
silver Democrats to have been able to remain
true to your country without violence to | the
amiable prejudices of party associations! But
though that great convention. knew its mind
upon its platform it was all at sea for a candi
date.
Then, fellow-citizens, did our young Lochin
var come out of tne West Born in the year of
Lincoln's election and in the State and com
munity that had witnessed the preparation of
that matchless character for his glory and
passion, removing in early professional life to
a more Western State, a man of the common
people, knowing their needs, sympathizing
with their sorrows, understanding their ways,
without powerful connections and lacking
wealth, by the sheer force of his character
and the brilliancy of his talents he forced
himself, at 36 years of age, to the candidacy of
a great party, nay, to the primacy of a great
cause. For the Presidency of the United States
who shall say that William J. Bryan is an acci
dent? Shall we not rather believe that he
represents and continues the same conserva
tion to high public duty that Lincoln
exemplified; the same heaven-bestowed
mission in behalf of his country and all
the masses of mankind? Yes, it is as
the exponent, the embodiment of a cause, that
William J. Bryan is significant and formid
able ; the cause generally of the masses against
the classes, of the great social progress of man
kind, and the cause, specifically, of the res
toration of silver to an equal place with gold
in the money system of the world, as the first
step in the line of general reformation and ad
vancement.
This cause Indicates the single gold stand
ard as an engine of Incalculable oppression
and wrong. At the outset it encounters an
army of defenders of that standard, who ex
haust all the resources of ingenuity in avoid
ing a decisive engagement. The merits of the
question are ignored. Epithets take the place
of argument and abuse substitutes discussion.
Among other desperate things which the gold
standard compels its defenders to do is to in
vent a new political ecouomy.
The gold standard advocate denies that there
is any relation between the quantity of money
and prices. Mankind, however, will not con
sent to be made over again so as to make non.
sense reasonable. We shall continue to beÂ«
lieve that when the quantity of real money
diminishes, prices must fall; that falling
prices meaa loss of profits, the failure of en
terprises, idleness for labor and bankruptcy
for borrowed capital; that the infusion of a
new supply ot basic money into the channels
of trade would tend to check the decline in
values, raise the prices of our products, re
store life to business, employment to labor
and prosperity to our people.
But we are accused of trying to legislate
value into silver. We do not claim that you
can legislate value. Bui you can legislate op
portunity and opportunity widens demand
and demand raises value. In l&H), the price
of silver bullion under the inffuence of ex
pected free coinage legislation, in a short time
rose from 40 cents to $1 20 an ounce. Nina
cents more would have meant par, whicfe2
would have been reached.Jiadthe bill become
a law.
June 36, 1893, the Indian mints were closed
to the coinage of the rupee. In four days the
price of silver fell about 20 per cent Law
cannot regulate the quantity of product for
which given weights of the precious metal
shall exchange but within very wide limits.
It can, by endowing both metals with full
money powers nnd openine the mints to their
free coinage, absolutely fix their relations to
each other and make them, thrown together,
practically oflesubsunce, measuring all values
and equally flowing where they are needed.
A debtor country, under the necessity of
paying an enormous interest charge every
year, together with vast sums paid for freight
carrying In foreign vessels and other sums
spent by our jieopie abroad, we simply cannot
soon indefinitely reducing the price of our
farm products, in which we must carefully
pay these obligations, without plunging our
selves into National bankruptcy and under
such circumstances as to mean also social
cataclysm.
Constantly exporting more bushels and tons
6l merchandise, but at prices that mean a con
stantly Bmaller return in money, our debt to
foreign sources must by and by come to repre
sent our total RssetÂ«. In 1869 we owed from
$1,200,000,000 to $1,400,000,000 to the rest
!>f the world. To-day it its estimated that we
owe $5,000,000,000 or $6,000,000,000, al
though in the meantime we have sent abroad
between 2000 and 3000 millions of dollars
worth more of bullion and merchandise tnan
we have received. And this international
equation, constantly running against us as a
people, is paralleled by internal experience of
much vaster proportions, whereby the auto
matic lengthening of our money standard is
working a gradual but certain enslavement of
sur producing classes to the money power.
W'q who advocate the restoration of silvnr
believe in the supremacy of the people and
the rule of law. We d-o not preach a revolu
tion. We propose, by arousing the people to a
realization of their condition, to open the
avenue to better things in the way contem
plated by our institutions. We are the friends
of peace. We are the true conservatives. The
poid standard advocate who proposes to de
lude the people, to defeat their Just wishes
and to balk their right impulses, is the real
fomentor of discontent.
I sympathize with tho feeiiug that actuates
some of our People's party friends in this mat
ter. That party has battled nobly for its prin
ciples. Through reviling* and buffeting and
great tribulation it has remained stead
fast, and it is a natural disposition
that Inclines many of its supporters,
now when success for its most
urgent contention seems witnin reach, to in
sist that it shall be accompanied by certain
concessions to it as an organization. But 1
cannot persuade myself that such a disposi
tion will be allowed to prevail to such an
extent as to imperil the union of all the
friends of bimetallism, iv achieving for man
kind the mightiest political victory of ail the
ages. Have the friends of this great cause
survived until now, only to lose the fruits of
their long sacrifice and service at the moment
of success? The prevention of this consum
mation would seem almost a crime.
We are met in a temple of concord. Let every
strain of selfishness be met aud mastered by
some divine chord of duty until all shall blend
in a cublime symphony of patriotism. Let
every voice in both these great conventions
attune itself to this high theme, and as our
mingled and harmonious utterance rises from
this fair city and spreads beyond rivers acd
mountains to the confines of the Republic,
millions on millions shall join the cnorus,
which, swelling day by day, shall by Novem
ber become a nation's song oi victory and
gratituae iik<* that of Miriam by the sea, when
Ehe sang : "Praise be to the Lord, for ha hath
triumphed gloriously."
Towne's speech was frequently inter
rupted by cheering and applause. When
he eulogized Senator Teller there was a
treat cheer from the delegates, but the
applause was small in comparison with
the outburst that followed the mention of
Bryan's name. Cheer after cheer arose,
and it was a considerable time before the
speaker could continue.
When the applause had subsided ex-
Governor St. John of Kansas was called
for. When he made his appearance there
was another outbnrst of cheering. His
allusion to Cleveland was greeted with
laughter.
Then Mrs. Helen Cougar of Indiana
made a rattling speech, which again
aroused the enthusiasm oi the members.
She charged that never since the days of
Belshazzar's feast bad there been more
drunkenness known than was displayed
in St. Louis the night before the Repub
lican convention adopted its platform last
month. In closing she took charge of the
convention, calling upon the band to
strike np "America," and asked the au
dience to join in singing that grand old
hymn. But few in tl.e hall, however,
could sing more than the first verse.
The next speaker was Judge Sheldon of
Connecticut, who spoke in favor of free
silver and of the indorsement of Bryan.
Vice-Chairnian Towne then took the
chair and announced that Mrs. Lease of
Kansas would address the convention this
evening. Towne also announced that the
sub-committee on resolutions had notified
him that it was not yet ready to report.
A meeting of the full committee would be
held one hour after taking recess.
The following resolution was proposed
by Judge Hillyer of Washington, D. C,
for the consideration of the delegates dur
ing recess:
Resolved, That in the present situation this
organization logically in the coming cam
paign must be representative of the indepen
dent free-silver Republicans; that the efforts
of the National convention should be chiefly
directed to combiniug and augmenting this
Republican element as an independent force
co-operating with the others for the election
of the candidates which this convention shall
name for President, Vice-President and mem
bers of a free-silver congress.
Hon. R. A. Cole of Wisconsin addressed
the convention. He believed heartily in
free coinage, but he took issue with that
part of Mrs. Cougar's address in which she
advocated prohibition, and he spoke in
defense of the brewing interests of Mil
waukee and St. Louis. He also protested
against her proposition for a combination
of forces upon the subject of land reform
and direct legislation.
His remarks caused much comment
among the members, and the confusion
became so great that the chairman was
obliged to rap for order and insist that the
speaker should be allowed to proceed.
Cole waited until quietness had been re
stored, and then resumed his speech.
At 12:50 the convention took a recess
until 2:30 p. m.
THE AFTERNOON SESSION.
More Time Allowed the Conference
Committee In Which to Com
plete Its Labors.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 23.â When Chair
man St. John called the convention to
order he stated that the committee ao
pointed yesterday to confer with the Peo
ple's party had not as yet been called upon
to exercise Its office, owing 10 the deiay in
permanent organization of the Populist
convention. It was a delicate operation
the committee bad entered on, said Mr.
Bt. John, and would require patience and
probably another day's session of the
Silver convention.
C. D. Bradshaw of Montana presented a
resolution of thanks to Dr. J. J. Mott,
chairman of the executive committee of
the Bimetallic League, in appreciation of
his services in arranging for the conven
tion. It was passed by a unanimous rising
vote.
Responding to calls for a speech. Dr.
Mott said be hoped and believed the silver
men would win the tight and expressed
his thanks for the vote just given.
It being announced that W. H. (Coin)
Harvey was in the room, cries were made
for him to speak, but on motion of a dele
gate from California, T. D. Lane, a gold
miuer and delegate from that State, was
invited to address the convention for five
minutes. This was Mr. Lane's first public
appearance; the first convention he ever
attended. Producing great quantities of
gold every Â«year, Mr. Lane aaid he wonld
tpend every dollar he owned in this great
and glorious cause of IS to 1. The soldier
who bore a bayonet of steel, he said, was
generous enough to spare the widow and
orphan; but when the bayonet was of goid
it spared neither widow nor orphan. [Great
cheers.] The reason he was a silver man,
he said, was because he had risen to that
fevel where he was above the impulse of
selfishness. Mr. Lane's maiden erfort was
a success.
Mr. Shinn of Kansas moved that the
committee on resolutions be requested to
make its report. Delegates were here on
expense; they needed aot to be educated
on the silver question ; the business
should be completed at the earliest hour.
Several gentlemen made argent speeches
for delay in order that the conference
committee night have time to perform its
duty. Mr. Doud of Missouri hoped that
the convention, having appointed a com*
mittee on conference, would not stultify
itself by adjourning until the Populists
bad bad an opportunity to perfect them
selves for the conference, as asked for.
Several of the speakers said they were
willing to remain here until the first of
November, if necessary, to accomplisu
their purpose. Those who were not will
ing to remain, said a delegate from Cali
fornia, like the Irishman, should have
gone back before they started.
Mr. Little of Kansas said that the Popu
list delegation from his State advised him
that ii the Silver convention wanted to
help the Bryan movement in that conven
tion it would nominate him and Bewail,
and he thought that should be done to
day. [Applause.]
Mr. St. John urged the passage of his
motion. This convention had appointed
a committee on conference, and he hoped
that now it would cot insult the Populist
convention by declaring itself upon the
matter in conference.
A vote by States was denied, and a mo
tion by Mr. St. John that when the con
vention adjourns this afternoon it be until
to-morrow was declared to have been car
ried, amid applause.
An effort was made to have a call of the
States made, by the terms of the motion of
Mr. Strong of Illinois agreed to at the
morning session, to show the previous
political affiliations of the delegates.
Much objection was made, however, on
the ground that delegations were not com
plete, and a delegate from Missouri moved
as an amendment that the results of the
poll be banded the secretary of the con
vention, and by him announced to-mor
row, but it was lost, and the roilcall was
ordered.
The poll as far as it was reported showed
that one Arkansan who waa a former Re
publican is now an ardent Bryan sup
porter. California reported 35 bolters from
Republicanism to Bryanism. Colorado 54,
Illinois 36, Indiana 16, lowa 21. Kansas 42,
Michigan 16, Minnesota 27, Missouri 40,
Montana 6, Nebraska 35, Nevada 9, New
Jersey 3, North Dakota 6, Ohio 5, Oregon
10, Pennsylvania 40, South Dakota 15,
Utah 2, Virginia 20, Washington 17, Wis
consin 9, Arizona 2, Indian Territory 4,
District of Columbia 4. Total, 496.
The other former affiliations were re
ported to be : Independents 12, National
ist 1. Green backer 1, Prohibitionists 9,
Populists 47, Democrats 15. The an
nouncement was received with applause.
An extract of a speech by Mr. Blame
made several years ago was read by the
secretary in which Mr. Blame declared
for the remonetization ami free coinage of
silver.
A resolution offered by Mr. Duniphan
of Missouri, that no candidate for Con
gress be voted for unless he be in favor of
the free coinage of silver, was referred to
the committee on resolutions.
Mr. Strong of Illinois offered the follow
ing resolution and ii was adopted:
Wherf.au, The false accusation is so fre
quently made that those who demand the
restoration of tlie silver dollar to its place as
equal to the gold dollar as a debt-payer under
our flag are not patriotic in the delense of our
National honor,
Rttolved, That all those who were true to the
old flag and who risked their lives either at
sea or land who are present as delegates at
this National Silver Convention, be requested
to stand on their feet until their number is
counted.
While the old veterans were on their
feet a Confederate veteran, General Mc-
Iver, occasioned much enthusiasm by
grasping the hand of L.F. Dow, a Union
soldier, and proclaiming that the former
enemies were united. "And may they
ever remain so against the gold forces of
the country," he added.
Only a few old soldiers rising, there
being comparatively few delegates pres
ent, suggestions were made that the count
be postponed until to-morrow morning.
No action was taken, and at 5:15 o'clock
the convention adjourned until to-mor
row at 10 a. H.

MONEY THE MAIN ISSUE.
Slogan of the Sllverites as Sounded
by tha Committee on
Resolutions.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. July 23.â The commit
tee on resolutions of the Silver convention
completed its work this afternoon by
adopting the platform and address to the
people which had been prepared by the
sub-committee The platform and ad
dress are as follows:
The National Silver party of America, in
convention assembled, hereby adopts the fol
lowing declaration of principles:
Firstâ The paramount issue at this time in
the United Slates is indisputably the money
question. It is between the British gold
standard, gold bonds and bank currency on
the one side, and the bimetallic standard and
no bonds, government currency and an Amer
ican policy on the other. In this issue we de
clare ourselves to be in favor of a
distinctively American financial system.
We are unalterably opposed to the
single gold standard, and demand the imme
diate return to the constitutional standard of
gold and silver by the restoration by this Gov
ernment, independently of any foreign power,
of the unrestricted coinage of both gold and
silver into standard money at the ratio of
16 to 1, and upon terms of exact equality as
they existed pricr to 1873, the silver coin to
be of full legal tsnder, equally with gold, for
all debts and duties, public and private, ana
we demand such legislation as will prevent
for the future the destruction of the legal
tender quality of any kind of money by private
contract.
We hold that the power to control and regu
late a paper currency is inseparable from the
power to coin money, and hence that all cur
rency intended to circulate as money should
be issued and its "volume controlled by the
General Government only and should be legal
tender.
We are unalterably opposed to the issua by
the United States of interest-bearing bonds in
time of pea'e, and we denounce as a blunder,
worse than a crime, the present treasury
policy, concurred in by & Republican House,
of plunging the country Into debt by hundreds
of niiiliouH in the vain attempt to maintain
the gold standard by borrowing gold, and we
demand the payment of all coin obligations for
the United States, as provided by existing laws,
In either gold or silver coin, at the option of
the Government and not at the option of the
creditor.
The demonetization of silver in 1873 enor
mously increased tne demand for gold, en
hanced its purchasing power and lowered all
prices measured by that standard; and since
that unjust and indefensible act the prices
of American products have fallen, upon an
average, nearly 50 per cent, carrying
down with them, proportionately, the money
value of all other forms of property.
Such a fall of prices has destroyed the profits
of legitimate industry, injuring the producer
for the benefit of the non-producer, increasing
the burden of the debtor, swelling the gains of
the creditor, paralyzing the productive ener
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1896.
gies of the American people, relegating to
idleness vast numbers of willing workers, send
ing the shadows of despair into the home of
the honest tollor, filling the land with tramps
and paapert and building up colos^a.l fortunes
at the money centers. In the effort to main
tain the gold standard the country has, within
the last two years, in a time of peace land
plenty, been loaded down with $262,000,000
of additional interest bearing debt under
such circumstances as to allow a syndicate of
native and foreign bankers to realize a net
profit of millions on a single deal.
It stands confessed that the gold standard
can only be upheld by so depleting our paper
currency as to force the prices of our products
below the European and even below the
Asiatic level, to enable us to sell In foreign
markets, thus aggravating the very evils of
which our peopl* so bitterly complain, de
grading American labor and striking at the
foundations ol Ml c.vUixttioniUelf.
The question us to who should present
the paper to tht< convention excited quite
a discussion. A. J. Warner of Ohio
favored having some Republican present
it. Representative Towne of Minnesota,
Mr. Irwin of Minnesota and Senator Jones
of Nevada were suggested, and the latter
was finally decided on. It was decided to
withhold the platform and address from
the convention until 8 o'clock, but the
paper was meantime given to the press.
The question of naming a delegate to nom
inate Bryan and Sewall was then taken
up. After a biief debate it was decided
not to have the Chicago candidates nom
inated by an individual, for the reason
that the committee aecommended such a
course.
ALLEN CHOSEN CHAIRMAN
{Continued from flrU Poo*- 1
the committee signing the minority re
port were read to the convention. Among
them was included the name of the com
mmeeman from Illinois, and that gentle
man rose and denounced it as unauthor
ized. The name was accordingly with
drawn.
Mr. Brown of Massachusetts moved to
lay on the table both majority and mi
nority reports until after the adoption of
rules by the convention.
The question was put by Senator Butler
('who had resumed the chair) and he de
cided that the motion to lay on the table
was lost.
The convention then at 7:15 o'clock be
gan to vote by States on the adoption of
the majority report (Allen for permanent
chairman), the utmost confusion prevail
ing. Late twilight had come when the
clerk proceeded to call the States and with
the prevailing turmoil and uproar it was
a slow process, and it was almost dark
before the result of the voting in the
first half a dozen States was obtained, and
it looked as though the vote could not be
completed to-night. But, to the surprise
of all, the electric current was turned on
at half-past 7 o'clock.
The vote was announced at 8:05 p. m. as
follows: For Allen, 758; for Campion, 564;
for Donnelly, 1. The detailed vote by
States is as follows:

In Connecticut there was one absent and Id
Maine thre* absent votes.
Ohio cast one vote for Donnelly.
As soon as the vote waa announced the
Bryan section of the convention broke out
into a wild shout of triumph, delegates
standing up and vociferating and waving
hats and fans, and again a procession of
cuidon- bearers took up the march through
the convention hall, yelling demoniacally.
The band took part in the performance
with the strains of "Hail Columbia" and
other patriotic airs.
Tills Bedlamite uproar, which even the
singing of the "Doxology" by a score of
enthusiastic delegates did not affect, lasted
over ten minutes, and did not cease until
after there were shouts for the police,
caused by a dispute about seats among the
members of the Illinois delegation.
Finally, at 8:20, some degree of order
was restored, wnen Mr. Watkins of Cali
fornia stepped to the platform and said
that the Campion men, of whom he was
one, had fought a grand fight and had
been squarely whipped, and now he moved
to make the nomination of Senator Allen
unanimous. The motion was adopted
with a whoop.
Senator Allen was escorted to the chair
by Lafe Pence, "Cyc:one" Davis and Ig
natius Donnelly, and was greeted with
cheers. He then addressed the conven
tion. He returned thanKs to the conven
tion for that mark of its confidence and
esteem. He said he would have preferred
to act simply as a delegate, but it had been
thought proper by a portion of .the dele
gates to nominate him as permanent presi
dent, and he had consented (in perhaps
an evil hour) that his name might be
used. During and after the rebellion the
gold power of Europe, aided by Its agents
in the United States, had fastened the
chains of industrial slavery on the people
of the United States, which it would take
almost a generation to strike off. It was a
part of the mission of Populism to free the
people from sectional prejudices. If any
suspicion existed anywhere that there
would be a bolt in this convention it was a
great mistake. [Applause.] Every dele
gation from Maine to Texas would bow to
the will of the convention. [Applause, j
He had no doubt that there was hope
in Wall street that this great convention
would split to pieces, and that the Peo
ple's party would be absorbed in the Re
publican party. [Hisses.] Minions of
Wall street could have been found in St.
Louis during the whole week. They had
gone to the hotels at night wearing badges
and falsely pretending to be delegates.
These men were the purchased chattels
oi the British gold power.
When this convention should have i
spoken its will, when it should have
named the next President ot the United
States [cheers] those creatures who
prowled like jackals around a graveyard i
would slip away without any fruit of
victory on their part. He had noticed in
the hail banners with the device, "Keep
in the middle of the road." He said s
"amen" to that. He not only wanted I
to keep in the middle of the road, but he
wanted the Populists to take the whole of
the road. [Cheers and laughter.]
"We never want." he said, "to get in
that stupid attitude where we stand so
closely in the middle of the road that the
procession would pass us. [Laughter.]
Let us put our men irv the middle of the
road. Lei us put them on either side of
the road, and let us grow so strong, so
powerful, so numerous, that we will force
the two old parties into the field outside of
the road." [Cheers and laughter.]
Allen paid his compliments to the Re
publican candidate for the Presidency,
speaking of him as "the modern Napoleon,
whose sole resemblance to the genuine
Bonaparte was the fact that he wears a hat
of the vintage of 120 years ago." [Laugh
ter.] The great Napoleon had made mis
takes in his Spanish and Russian cam
paigns, and had gone down at Waterloo
before Wellington, who was not then fa
mous as a general, but was known after
ward as the Iron Duke.
"What," he asked, "is to become of this
simulated Napoleon, this Napoleon of
Canton, Onio? [Laughter.] He has made
two mistakes also â one when he declared
that happineas and relief could come to
the people by doubling the tax on im
ported articles. According to the logic of
our modern Napoleon, when you are car
rying a burden of 200 pounds the way to
lessen that burden is to increase it to 400
pounds, and where you are paying an
average tax of $2 a head, the way to lessen
that burden is to increase it to $4. The
genuine Napoleon made a mistake when
he met Wellington and the allied forces at
Waterloo.
"Somewhere in this broad land," Sen
ator Allen continued, "either in the East
or in the South, or in the North or in the
great plains of the Northwest, is to be
found a Wellington who will overthrow
this modern Napoleon in November
next." [Cdeers.l
Senator Allen said the party was now at
the most critical point in its history. It
would prepare a platform to-morrow night
and men would be nominated who would
stand upon that platform. [Cheers.]
Before he left Washington people in
official life there bad asted him to use his
influence to keep the Populists in the
middle of the road. How did they become
interested in Populists? [Laughter and
cheers.] What did they want tne PopuÂ«
lists to do? To promulgate a wild plat- j
form which would be the subject of
ridicule.
"They want you," he continued, "to
place upon that platform as a candidate
for President a man who is willing to run
for the empty nonor of running with cer- j
tain defeat staring him in the face. Yes,
that is the way they want you 'to keep in
the middle of the road.' [Confusion and
some indications of dissent.]
Mr. Allen referred to "boodlsrs" with
Mark Hanna's money in their pocket
hanging around the convention, and ex- i
pressed his belief that this convention |
would place in nomination a candidate for |
President and Vice-President who would j
not be an adjunct to the success of the
single gold standard upon either the Re
publican or Democratic ticket He begged
them to rueka no mistake.
"Do you want MoKinley?" he asked,
J and loud cries of "No" were raised. "Do
you want more of Grover Cleveland?
["No."] Do you want $263,000,000 more of
gold bonds in time of peace? [A voice â
"No, nor silver, either."] Do you want
Grover Cleveland and McKinley to be
shoulder to shoulder in aid of the gold
power?" [Mixed cries of "Yes" and
"No."]
It was a little suspicious, in his opinion,
when Carlisle and John Sherman came
.together â a little suspicious when he saw
the great and good Deacon Dana and Herr
Most together. [Laughter and cheer?.]
A little suspicious when his Excellency,
Mr. Cleveland, said that upon the result of
this convention might depend whether he
would or not become a candidate for a
third term. Continuing his catechism he
asked :
"Do you want an income tax? ["Yes.''
"No," and confusion.] Do you want men
in executive offices to appoint a faw more
Shirases upon the Supreme bench ? [Loud
cries of "No!"] Do you want men in favor
of Government ownership of railroads?
["Yes," and loud cheers.] If you had to
take your choice between this and a man
opposed to all these which would you take ?
[Cries of "Bryan" and many expressions
of dissent, one delegate shouting, "We
don't want a Democrat I"]
"I am not advocating," Senator Allen
continued, "any choice for you to make.
If by putting a third ticket in the field you
would deleat free coinage, defeat the with
drawal of National bank notes, defeat Gov
ernment ownership of railroads and tele
graphs, defeat the Income tax and fasten
on the people gold monometallism and
high taxes for ten years to come, would
you do it? [Cries of "Bryan !"] It is your
choice to make, not mine. When I
go back to Nebraska I want to be
able to say that all of those great
doctrines which we have preached
for years are now made possible by your
action. [Applause-] I do not want to
have to say that the Populist party was
stupid, was blind, kept in the middle of
the road and missed Us opportunity."
[Cheers.]
In some further remarks Senator Allen
was interrupted by questions from a critic
in the gallery as to a former speech, which
brought down cries of disapproval from
delegates on the floor and which seemed
to give some annoyance to the Senator.
When he resumed his speech he touched
on the necessity of including in deference
to the majority. It was said, he remarked,
that the Populists knew nothing, that
they^ did not know enough, to hold their
convention. [A voiceâ "We will fool
them this time."]
Senator Allenâ Yes; we will fool them.
We will stand together, whether we know
much or little. [Cheers.] We may not
be equipped with the intellect of some of
them, but we are equipped with better
parts. [Applause.] Mr. Whitney and
Governor Hill and Senator Smith went
to Chicago on a campaign of education;
but they went back with it unopened.
[Laughter.] It is unknown whether that
education was embraced in barrels or in
boxes. [Laughter.] We are to have a
campaign of education this fali, and some
say it will cost five millions of dollars to
carry the election for McKinley and
Hobart. They think they can buy you.
[Voicesâ "They cannot."]
Senator Allen then expressed the
opinion that be had entertained the con
vention sufficiently, and asked, "What is
your pleasure?"
Senator Butler moved the appointment
of a committee of twenty- five delegates to
confer to-night or to-morrow morning
with a conference committee of the Sil
ver convention, whose honored presi
dent now occupied a seat on the plat*
form. [Shouts of "No, no â adjoton."]
Agreed to.
Burnham of lowa offered a resolution
for the appointment of a committee of one
delegate from each State to consider and
report in what manner the People's party
can co-operate with other parties on the
question of free coinage of silver. Re
ferred to the committee on rules.
The report of the committee on rules
was then (10 p. m.) presented and read, but
without action on it the convention at
10:08 adjourned until to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock.

WILL INDORSE BRYAN.
Therefore, There Is Nothing for
the Conference Committee to
Do When They Meet.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Juiy 23.â The confer
ence committees of the two conventions
will meet at an early hour to-morrow
morning. The silver convention commit
tee has organized by Ibe selection of G. W.
Baker of California) â chairman, and two
or three sessions have been held, at which
the subject matter committed to it was
discussed.
At midnight the i dications were quite
favorable for the committee to find very
little, if anything, to do when It meets.
Constant inroads have been made upon
the anti-Bryau forces in the Populist
party, and after it was learned that the
North Carolina delegation, under the lead
of Senator Butler, temporary chairman of
the convention, had practically decided
not to further oppose his nomination and
not to bolt the convention in case the
majority also placed Mr. Sewall in nomi
nation, the way was easy for the apostles
of the Bryan movement to secure the sup
port of other Southern delegations. Texas
was the last to come into line.
After midnight "Cyclone" Davis said
the probabilities were that tho nomination
of Bryan would be made without serious
opposition in the convention.

ON THE OMAHA PLAN.
Planks In the Platform to Be Re
ported by the Committee on
Resolutions.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 23.â The commit
tee on resolutions appointed by the Popu
list convention met at the Lindell Hotel
at 12:30 o'clock. General J. B. Weaver
was chosen chairman. A sub-committee
of twenty-three was appointed to con
struct a platform and this committee was
divided into sub-committees. These com
mittees were in session until lale to-nijÂ»ht,
and at 9 o'clock to-night got together for
the purpose of putting their planks into a
harmonious whole.
The preamble will reaffirm the declara
tions of the Omaha platform. The finan
cial plank, as reported to the full commit
tee and as it will be reported to the con
vention to-morrow, is as follows:
First â We demand a National currency safe
and sound, issued by the General Government
only, a full legal tender for all debts, public
and private, aud receivable for all debts due
the Government and that without the use of
banking corporations; a just equitable and ef
ficient means of distribution direct to the peo
ple through the lawful disbursements of the
Government.
Secondâ We demand the free and unte
stricted coinage of silver and gold at the pres
ent legal ratio of 16 to 1 by the United States
and that without awaiting the consent of for
eign nations.
Thirdâ We demand that th^ volume of the
circulating medium be speedily increased to
an amount mfficient to meet the demands of
the business and population of this country
and to restore the level of prices, labor and
production and thereby re-establish the pros
perity and happiness ofthe people.
Fourthâ We denounce the Democratic and
Republican policies that seek to enslave oUr
people by the issuance of interest-bearing
bonds tc be sold on English and foreign mar
kets, and steadfastly adnere to an American
policy that will produce revenue sufficient to
maintain legitimate and economic expenses.
Fifthâ We demand such legislation as will
prevent the demonetization of the lawful
money of the United States by private con
tract.
Sixthâ We demand that the Government in
payment of its obligations shall use its option
as to the kind of lawful money in which it
shall pay them, and we denounce the present
and preceding administrations for surrender
ing this option to the holders of Government
obligations.
Seventh â We demand a proper income tax
to the end that aggregated wealth shall bear
Its just proportion of taxation.
Eighthâ We demand that postal savings
banks be established by the Government for
the safe deposit of the savings of the people
and to facilitate exchange.
The direct legislation plank is as follows :
We hold thac all governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the governed,
and in order that the consent of the governed
may be ascertained we favor direct lecislation
under proper constitutional safeguards, so
that the citizens shall have the right of initi
ating, framing and proposing laws, and of
compelling the submission thereof and of ail
important laws, whether proposed by National.
State or local legislatures, to a direct vote of
the people for their approval or rejection.
The preamble was discussed for upward
of an hour. A number of propositions
were submitted and it required careful
generalship on the part of General Weaver
to weld this mass of raw material into a
prelude that was neither too long nor too
radical.
This preamble will reaffirm the adher
ence of the convention to the principles
of the People's party, as enunciated at
Omaha July 4, 1892, will declare that the
two old parties have brought the country
to financial ruin, and calls attention to the
fact that four years ago the Populists pre
dieted the complete surrender of the Gov
ernment to corporate powers, a condition
which is now apparent to all.
It further states that "while as a Nation
we claim to have political power, we must
regain our financial prestige before we
assume our place as a free and independ
ent Nation."
It also declares that European money
changers have shaped legislation and been
more potent than the voice of the Amer
ican people; that executive power and
patronage have been used to corrupt
Legislatures and defeat the will of the
people; that plutocracy has thereby been
enthroned on the ruins of the democracy.
The preamble concludes with a recom
mendation for the adoption of the plat
form submitted to the end that the Gov
ernment of the fathers may be restored
and the welfare o! the country aud ol
prosperity may be secured.
Mr. Coxey of Ohio will make a minority
report requesting that his well-known
non-interest-bearing bond scheme be in
corporated in the platform.
The plank relating tb public lands pro
hibits alien ownership; provides that the
unearned land grants of the Pacific and
other railways shall revert to 4he Govern
ment to be held for bona-lidc settlers.
The sub-committee adopted a resolution
providing for the election of United Sates
Senators by a direct vote.
The only planks which the sub-commit
tee agreed upon to-night were those re
lating to finance, public lands, transporta
tion and direct legislation. These were
the only subjects referred to the sub-com
mittee.

SENATOR DUBOIS SPEAKS.
Although Ha Supports Bryan, Ho
Declares That He Is Yet a
Republican.
DENVER, Colo., July 22.â The post
poned ratification of the nomination of
Bryan and Sewall by the Democrats of
this city was held to-night in the Broad
way Theater and an immense audience
was present. The silver Republican Sena
tors, Teller, Dubois and Mantle and Con
gressmen Hartman and Shafroth, had
seats on the stage. Senator Dubois, for
his associates, made an address, which
was his tirst public utterance since the St.
Louis convention. He said in part :
You honor us tof night with this great dem
onstration because we have declared that
Bryan and Sewall represent for this campaign
the cause of the people, the great principle of
bimetaillism for which you have been so long
contending, and that we intend to give them a
support equal to our entire energy and ability.
Sophistries and refinements of reasoning will
not avail in this struggle now upon us, espe
cially in this mountain country. The issue is
squarely drawn, and we are either for silver or
for narrow partisanship.
Inasmuch as the Republican party has de
clared for the single gold standard, 1 trust our
opponents will not insult our intelligence by
supporting that party uuless they declare also
for the single gold standard. There is but one
issue before us to-day. The difference be
tween the parties regarding the tariff Is only
the difference of schedules, and whether the
rates of duty shall be fixed at 40 or 45 cents
cannot be made an exciting subject of contro
versy.
I am a believer in the principle of protec
tion, and after this money question is settled
in favor of silver will contend in the future as
in the past for this principle. Ido not aban
don it at all, but so long as we remain on the
gold standard no amount of protection will
protect our manufactures and laborers, hence
it is my duty to aid in the restoration of silver
first, leaving other questions in abeyance
until that is accomplished.
Our candidate for President, Mr. Bryan, by
his high personal character, his ability, hU
patriotism acd his unswerving devotion to
the cause oi bimetallism, is entitled to the
energetic support of every one who desires to
rescue the country irom the distress which we
cannot shake off so long as we cling to the
single gold standard. It is not necessary for
mo to join the Democratic party nor have I
done so, but while the National Republican
party persists in ita advocacy of *he single
gold standard just so long will 1 reiuse it my
support and give my adhesion to those
National candidates who most truly repre
sent the cause of bimetallism.
EDITOR CHASE ON GUARD.
Propounds Questions to Candidates
Regarding the Rights of Afro-
Americans.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 23.â A Sun
special from Washington says: W. Calvin
Chase, the editor of the Bee, tne organ of
toe colored race of the District of Colum
bia, is anxious to know what the colored
people are to expect after election from
the victorious political party. As the
most direct method of obtaining this
much-desired information, Editor Chase
has written letters to candidat-s McKin
ley and Bryan. Tq^ Major McKinley Mr.
Chase says:
"There is a question that is more im
portant to a certain class of your fellow
citizens than gold or silver; a question in
which the personal liberty, the political
and legal rights of the people are involved.
While your platform declares against
lyncn law, we have yet to see the execu
tive of any party enforce the amendments
to our constitution which guarantee equal
rights to all classes of citizens, irrespective
of color or condition.
"Should the party succeed in electing
you or the American people decide that
you are the choice for President of the
"United States, what part will Afro-Amer
icans play in the councils of your admin
istration or what consideration will they
receive?"
In conclusion Mr. Chase expresses the
hope that the dignity of Mr. McKinley' s
position will not preclude a reply.
In his letter to Mr. Bryan Mr. Chase re
fers to the class of citizens known as Afro-
Americans, and makes the statement that
this class has been oppressed by the Demo
cratic party.
"And in that party," he said, "they
have not been welcomed except by the in
novation made by President Cleveland,
who must be given credit for the courage
of his convictions and the interest he has
taken in certain representative Afio-Amer
icans in this country. In the Democratic
or free-silver platform notning is said in
behalf of Afro-Americans, nor did your
party deem them of sufficient importance

"There exists in certain sections of this

Afro-Americans wno are suspected of
crime and who are lynched without Judge

and contrary to the laws of the States in
which these offenses are committed. It is
to be deplored that the Democratic Con
vention did not see fit to give utterance to

In conclusion, he asks Mr. Bryan:
"What place will Afro-Americans occupy

An Honor to Nebraska
LINCOLN, Nebr., July 23.â "1 am al
ways glad to see a Nebraska man honored,"
said Mr. Bryan this evening when in
formed of Senator Allen's selection as per
manent chairman of the Populist conven
tion. "Bat I must decline to be inter
viewed with regard to any matter at St.
Louis."
The weather has been cold and wet. and
Mr. Bryan remained indoors working hard
at his mail. He had a number of callers,
but none of note. The bulletins from St.
Louis were telephoned Mr. Bryan from
thu telegraph office, but he did not com
mit himself to anybody on their import to
himself. The plans for his trip to New
York to receive formal notification of his
nomination are not definitely arranged,
but it is probable he will make speeches
en route at Pittsburg, Philadelphia aud
Washington.

its infancy in our State. Untold millions
of yellow metal await extraction. Already
there has been great resumption of placer

A THIRD TICKET,
Says the Situation Renders
Such a Course a
Necessity.
HE SCOLDS REPUBLICANS
Complains of Their Indifference
to the Sound-Money
Democracy.
FEARS THE POPULISTS' ACTION
And Suggests What Should Have Been
Done to Make Free Coinage
Impossible.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 23.â William
C. Whitney, in an interview with a repre
sentative of the United Press to-day, was
asked if in his judgment there would be a
third ticket nominated by the sound
money Democrats. He replied:
"I think events and the course of the
Republican leaders are making it inevit
able. The general situation," he con
tinued, "is far worse to-day, in ruy
opinion, than it was ten days ago. The
Republican managers and candidates have
shown no realizing sense of the situation.
They have failed to avail themselves of a
great opportunity for benefiting the
country. If the present condition of af
fairs continues for any length of time
sound-money Democrats are bound to or
ganize and it cannot be prevented.
"The truth is there does not seem to be in
the East a realizing sense of the seriousness
and sincerity of the free silver movement.
You may call it a craze, but it has captured
the imaginations of the great mass of
people throughout the entire West and
(South, and it has a much stronger follow
ing in some portions of the East not
closely allied to the commercial centers
than is generally supposed. It is the re-
Bult of reading and agitation. It has
become a iixed opinion and an unreason
ing one.
"I was satisfied before we went to
Chicago that nothing could be accom
plished in the direction of changing or
modifying the free silver idea, and I said
bo. Nevertheless, it was our duty to go
there and emphasize the strength of the
convictions of the Eastern Democrats, and,
further, to afford the country an object
lesson showing so plainly that it could not
be misunderstood the un-Democratic and
revolutionary spirit which dominated the
movement.
"In this we were successful. The Demo
cratic mask was pretty effectually re
moved from the face of the Populism
which had forced itself for the time being
into a position of control. That was all
thai the sound-money Democrats could
hope to accomplish, and that they diJ
effectually and unselfishly. There never
has been in any party convention such a
rigorous declaration of independence as
was exhibited at Chicago when 254 dele
gates refused to participate in the selec
tion of candidates.
"What should have been the next step
in the fight for the preservation of Na
tional honor and sound finance? We had
suddenly come upon a new and very great
crisis â one that called for the sinking of
partisanship and the union of sound
monev men to rescue the country from
disaster. Hundreds of thousands of Dem
ocrats stood ready to declare themselves
upon that issue and were ready to subordi
nate everything, even to voting for the
Republican candidate.
"What was the duty of the hour? Clear
ly it was one thai devolved upon the Re
publican party and its candidates. There
should have been an immediate recogni
tion of a new situation, and the Repub
licans should have been the first to wel
come sound-money Democrats to a non
partisan union, subordinating all other
things to this question of honor. It was a
new issue. An opportunity was offered to
right for the established institutions of
the countryâ the fundamental things that
underlie party differences â iaw and order,
National honor, common honesty, the
integrity of the courtsâ all such things
without which we do not exist as a Nation
at ail.
"A single glimpse at the Chicago plat
form and at the spectacle of one-third of
the Democratic party in open revolt
phonld have been enough to have shown
them instantly the necessity of a new
alignment of parties upon non-partisan
lines. No greater opportunity for patri
otic action was ever offered a party, and it
has all been thrown away."
"What has been the course of the Re
publican leaders and the Republican
press?" Mr. Whitney was asked.
"They have insisted upon putting the
free-silver enthusiasts and sonnd-money
Democrats into one class and denouncing
all together under the name of the Na
tional Democracy. Mr. McKinley con
tinues to discuss .the tariff, which has
ceased to be an actual issue in this cam
paign as completely as slavery, and the
Republican press and lenders persist in
deriding all Democrats en masse. They
jeer at Democracy, and yet admit that the
doubtful States are those where Republi
canism has been dominant for thirty
years.
"Such a policy persisted in can have
but one effect. It will arouse the innate
party loyalty of patriotic Democrats. It
will make them angry and will result in
drawing sharo party lines. It is difficult
enough for a Democrat to contemplate the
possibility of voting for McKiniey or to
look upon him as the leader of any great
cause, and the present course of the Re
pubiicans is tending to make it impossible.
If they continue in this line one thing wit]
certainly happen â the sound-money Demo
crats will nominate a third ticket, and
thus divide the sound-money vote in the
great battleground of the Middle West, to.
save the vote from drifting back to the
Cbicapo ticket.
"The Republicans will need in Novem
ber all the aid they can obtain from sound
money Democrats. If they think they can
hold their natural strength through the
Middle West or even in some parts of the
Ea.-t by the single tendency to party alie
giance they are mistaken. A free-silver
enthusiasm has obtained a hold upon Re
publicans throughout the West and farm
ing commuDities of the East quite a&
strong as upon Democrats, and they can
not be diverted from their purpose by
either appeals to party loyalty or discus
sion of a dead issue. It is evident that
the free-silver vote is to be united. They
are only differing at St. Louis as to
whether they shall unite on candidates
now or with different candidates divide up
the electors by States. In either case the
vote will be united on election day.
"This shoifd be opposed by a solid and
sound-money Tote. It never can be if, in
addition to McKinley, Democrats must
vote for McKinleyism and all that it rep
resents. The issue of the past should be
buried until the country has been rescued
by patriotic action from its present peril.
"It ought to be plain to all thoughtful
and patriotic Republicans that the time
has come when it is absolutely necessary
for all good citizens to drop for the time
being partisanship and work together
earnestly and intelligently for the com
mon good. To trifle with a crisis so seri
ous as this or to attempt to ignore or be
little would be both a blunder and a crime.
"I think that at the present moment
the multitudes of sound-money Demo
crats, represented by the 254 delegates
who refused to vote in the Chicago con
vention, are fully awake to the danger
which confronts the Nation, and are will
ing to co-operate heartily and honestly,
with equally patriotic members of other
parties, in any rational movement to
stamp out this heresy. How long they
will continue in this frame of mind no
man can tell. But one fact is certain, the
present responsibility for meeting this sit
uation rests upon the Republican candi
dates and leaders, and if they are to act
intelligently and patriotically there is no
time to lose." \
ENGINEERED BY ECKELS.
The Comptroller of Currency Work-
ing to Secure a Democratic
Sound Money Ticket.
CHICAGO. 111., July 23.â A morning
paper prints the following from its Wash
ington correspondent: Comptroller Eckels,
who has on previous occasions voiced the
financial sentiments of the administra
tion at public gatherings, announced yes
terday that the sound money Democrats
are determined to put a third ticket in the
field. He named Senators John M.
Palmer of Illinois for President and John
B. Gordon of Georgia for Vice-President.
EcKles left Washington last night for
Chicago, and is expected to preach the
"third ticket doctrine" to his sound
money friends in the West.
Secretary Lamont returned to Washing
ton yesterday from a visit to the Presi
dent at Gray Gables. Passing through
New York yesterday Secretary Lamont
met a number of prominent sound money
Democrats and discussed with them the
situation.
During the absence of Secretary La
mont's family from Washington the Sec
retary of War takes his meals at the
Arlington Hotel, where yesterday he met
Comptroller Eckels and First Assistant
Postmaster-General Frank Jones of Il
linois at lunch. It is understood that the
attitude of the friends of the administra
tion in the present emergency was the
topic of conversation during the midday
repast.
As 1 Secretary Lamont was leaving the
hotel he stopped a fr.w minutes to say he
fully appreciated the gravity of the situa
tion, but he did not care to express an
opinion as to the best method of main
taining the supremacy of the gold stand
ard. For the present he was engaged in
running the War Department, and not di
recting political battles.
The Comptroller was more communica
tive on the political situation when ques
tioned shortly afterward, and admitted
that a third ticket would surely be placed
in the held. In reply to the suggestion
that many of the leading Democrats in
New York'are opposed to such a mo ye he
said a respectable representation from New
York would attend the third ticket con
ference or convention.
"There are thousands ot good Demo
crats," said Comptroller Eckels, "who
desire to go into the field and discuss the
money question, but they cannot swallow
Bryan, nor can they accept McKinley as
the embodiment of their views. Under
the circumstances there is no place for
them to go, and it becomes necessary to
put a third ticket in the field. The battle
for sound money is not over and Bland
and oilier free silver apostles were defeated
two years ago because the question was
fairly put before the practical people in the
various free silver strongholds."
Missouri Republicans.
SPRINGFIELD, Mo., July 23.â The Re
publican State Convention, which met
here yesterday, to-night nominated R. E.
Lewis of Clinton for Governor and took a
recess until to-morrow morning. The
platform approved "each and every plank
of the Ht. Louis platform" and indorsed
the nomination ot McKinley and Hooart.
The nomination of Lewis emphasizes the
complete overthrow of the Pilxey machine.
Where Is Eueene V. Debs?
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 23.â The state
ment that Eugene V. Debs had arrived in
St. Louis appears to have been incorrect.
He could not be located in this city to
night by representatives of the United
Press, althougn some of the delegates in
sisted that he was here.
HOKE SMITH MAY RETIRE
President Cleveland Does Not
Like His Views About
Bryan.
If the Secretary Resigns It Will Prob
ab.y Not Be of His Own
Accord.
WASHINGTON, D. ft, July 23.-It is
reported to-night that Secretary of the
Interior Hoke Smith has iniormed several
intimate friends that he is ready to resign
from the Cabinet if his course in support
ing the Bryan and Seawall ticket makes
*uc;h a course necessary. Those persons
who believe they know Mr. Smith are in
clined to be skeptical as to his readiness
to lay down his portfolio and the fat sal
ary thereof without some stronger reason
than mere difference of opinion. Secretary
Smith is in town, but he declines to dis
cuss the matter to-night.
It is quite possible, of course, that Mr.
Smith may retire from the Cabinet; but if
he does, it is likely that President Cleve
land vill take the initiative. His "Cabi
net officers" have been very properly
styled ''his clerks." He rules with a rod of
iron. If therefore, President Cleveland
resents the policy of Hoke Smith in sup
porting the Democratic ticKet, he will
not keep ihe Secretary of the Interior in
long suspense. The absurd inconsistency
ol Mr. bmnh s editorial in yesterday's At
janta Journal, in disapproving the Chicago
platform but supporting the candidates
was regarded here as a diplomatic sop to
Mr. Cleveland to allay his irritation

Buckeyes.
TWO BRIEF SPEECHES.
Railroad Employes Ask the Re

AN APPEAL FOB GOOD MONEY.
The Country's Welfare Said to De
pend Upon a Solution of the
Money Question.
ALLIANCE, Ohio, July 23.â Major Mc-
Kinley left Cleveland this morning for
Alliance to fill an engagement of long
standing at Mount Vernon College. He
was met in Alliance by ex-Congressman
Taylor, Congressman Kerr, President
Marsh and other friends of the college. At
the college, Major McKinley's appearance
was greeted with cheers. He briefly ad
dressed the crowd, saying: "I am glad to
know that people in every part of this
country mean to be devoted to one flag,
the glorious old stars and stripes.
"Tne people of this country this year
mean to maintain the financial honor of
the country as sacredly as they maintain
the honor of the flat;."
When Major McKinley returned to the
station at 11 o'clock to take his special
train for Cleveland he was met by a dele
gation of railway employes, who asked him
to address their fellow-workmen. He did
so in an informal way and was loudly
cheered. He said in part:
"All of us are interested in the welfare
of our country, because in the welfare of
our country is involved the individual
welfare of every citizen. If our great
country is prosperous then the people are
prosperous. What we all want, no matter
to what political organization we may
have belonged in the past, is a return to
the good times of years aeo. We want
good prices and good wages, and when we
have them we want them to be paid in
good money. [Applause.]
"Whether our prices be high or whether
they be low; whether our wages be good
or whether they be bad, they are ail better
by being paid in dollars worth one hun
dred cents each. [Tremendous cheering.]
If we have good wages they are better by
being paid in good dollars. If
we have poor wages they are
made poorer by being paid in poor
dollars; and my fellow-citizens, what we all
want is to keep our money equal to that of
the most enlightened nations of the

PUBLIC DECENCE FIOLATED.
Pantomime Act re if and Her â  Manager
Ar rented at AÂ«W York.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 23.-Hope
Booth, the actress, and John W. Hamil
ton, the lessee and manager of the Casino
and American Theater roof garden, were
arrested late yesterday afternoon and ar
raigned in Jefferson Market Court on a
charge of having broken a section of the
penal code, in that they had violated pub
lic decency in a performance given at the
American Theater roof garden.
The trouble was caused by the produc
tion by Miss Booth of a sketch entitled
"Ten Minutes in the Latin Quarter, or a
Study of the Nude." It was first produced
by her at the garden on Monday night,
and was universally condemned by the
press on Tuesday morning. In this
sketch, which is a pantomime, Miss Booth
first appears as a ragged flower-girl and
offers herself to an artist as a model. The
artist refuses to accept her unless she
poses in "the altogether," and after she
has mad* many protests against it she
finally accepts his proposition. The lights
are then turned down.and when they are
again turned on Miss Booth is seen posing
in what seems to be entire nudity. Sev
eral poses are shown and then the sketch
comes to an end.
When the two prisoners were arraigned
their lawyer asked that the case be ad
journed until to-day and tire request was
granted. Afterward Miss Booth said that
she saw nothing indecent in her sketch,
and that if permitted she would continue
to appear in it.
SEQUEL TO A ROMANCE,
Los Angeles Girl Weds the Man
Who Saves Her From
Drowning.
After a Brief Honeymoon He Borrows
From His Mother-in-Law and
Disappears.
NEW YORK, to. V., July 23.â Less than
fifteen years old, a pretty California girl
wept in the Yorkvilie court to-day as she
told a story of marriage to a handsome
stranger who had saved her life and de
serted her in a strange city within seven
teen days of making her his wife. Her
implicit faith was more than equaled by
that of her mother, who allowed her to be
married to the hero of her romance in the
hope that she would thus be cured of her
longing for the life of an actress.
The deserted young bride told Magis
trate Simms that she was Mrs. Belle Joyce,
and until July 6 had been Miss Belle
Humphries. Her father is a well-to-do
butcher in Los Angeies, and George J.
Joyce, who married her, had been em
ployed in another butcher-shop in the
same city.
From the story the girl told while she
wept in court, she had met Joyce only ten
days before their marriage. She hadbeen
bathing near Los Angeles. A current
swept her beyond her depth. Joyce res
cued her. Soon an attachment sprang up
between the two. Tney became enfejuted
within a week, and on. July 6 jrere married
in Bethlehem Church, Los Angeles, by
the Rev. Dana D. Bartlett.
Nothing much was known in Los
Angeles about Joyce. He said he once
had been an actor, and in trying to dis
suade Belle from going on the stage told
her that his experience in the profession
bad not been pleasant. The girl believed
him and this argument, added to that of
her mother, so.on put out of her mind all
ideas of being an actress.
On the day of the marriage Joyce bor
rowed $200 from his mother-in-law to pay
the expenses of the wedding tour. The
money received, they set out for New
York ana reached the city on Monday.
They were directed to a hotel in Forty
second street, near the Grand Central
Railroad station, but left it the next duy
and took a furnished room at 30 Bird
avenue.
At this point $30 of the $200 remained.
Joyce went out on Tuesday morning, paid
$9 for a suit of clothes, bought a silk hat
and a pair of tan shoes and returned to
the house. Then he gave his wife 75cnnts
and left her. She nas not seer, him since.
He had told her that he was going to
some point near Niagara Falls, where his
grandiather lived, from whom he ex
pected to get $200 to pay his mother
in-law.
The girl-wife remained alone in her
rooms. She was afraid to go out and ex
pected any moment that her husband
would return. She did not wish to be
away when he arrived.
Yesterday she went through his trunk
and found reasons for losing laith in him.
In fact, it looked to her as though she was
one of several girls whom he had deserted
in a similar manner. The trunk contained
many letters from girls all over the coun
try. To several of them, all written by
different persons, the name Mn, Joyce
was signed.
This was enough for the young girl, and
shÂ« investigated no further. She wept all
through Wednesday night, she said, and
yesterday morning went, to the East
Thirty-fifth street police station, from
where Sergeant Bell directed her to the
Yorkvilie court, and her story was told to
Magistrate Simms. He gave her into the
care of the Gerry Society, with instruc
tions that her parents should be com
municated with at once. He set her case
down for a hearing on July 30.
The girl says that Joyce is a handsome
fellow, 23 years of age, with aristocratic
features and a black mustache.

SCORE WILLIAM C. WHITNEY
Mistake of the Leader in Not Causing
a Bolt After the Silver Plat
form's Adoption.
CHICAGO, 111., July 23.â Pursuant to
the call issued by the Democratic organi
zation of Illinois, which is opposed to the
Chicago platform and in favor of holding
another nominating convention to declare
against free silver, a conference of repre
sentative Democrats from nine States was
held to-night at the Auditorium Hotel.
Illinois, "Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana,
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, lowa and Ne
braska were the States represented, most
of the seventy-five delegates being sent by
sound-money organizations. The unani
mous sentiment of the conference was that
another Democratic convention should be
called and the following resolution to that
end was adopted:
Resolved, That It is the sense of this confer
ence that there should be a Democratic Na
tional Convention held, a Democratic plat
form enunciated and a Democratic ticket
nominated for the offices of President and
Vice-President of the United States, >a ! d con
vention to be held not later than September 22.
The resolution, which was offered by W.
R. Shelby of Michigan, was unanimously
adopted.
The matter of detail as to the call was
left to a committee of one from each of the
States represented, which the chair ap
pointed as follows: Indiana, John R.
Wilson; lowa, Henry Vollmer; Ohio, S.
h. Holding; Nebraska, Fred W. Vaughn;
Michigan, W. R. Shelby; Kentucky,
George M. Davies; Missouri, L. C. Kraut
noff; Wisconsin. Senator Vilas and Gen
eral Bragg; Illinois, Henry S. Robins.
The committee will report at 11 o'clock
to-morrow, to which hour the conference
adjourned.
Early in the meeting there was clearly
defined opposition to taking immediate
action toward issuing the convention call,
and a protracted debate ensued as to the
details and mode of procedure. Senator
Vilas of vVisconsin, 8. H. Holding ot Ohio
and others advocated the holding of mass
meetings in the States represented, to take
counsel of the people there to get the
strength of the sound-money Democrats
who repudiate the platform and demand a
third ticket.
Senator Vilas favored the selection of
delegates to a National convention at
mass-meetings rather than at delegate con
ventions. Those who opposed immediate
action did so on the ground that the dele
gates were individuals who bad no au
thority to represent any one but them
selves.
Several of the speakers sharply criti
cized Mr. Whitney for his reported advice
to Democrats to vote for McKinley and
for not leading a bolt from the Chicago
convention when the platform was
adopted. It was alleged that the Eastern
delegates bad been recreant and dilatory
and that Senator Gray should have ap
pointed the committee which he was au
thorized to name at the conference of gold
delegates during the convention.
The Chicago platform was denounced as
revolutionary, anarchistic, Populistic and
un-Democratic to the core.
General Bragg, who was chairman of
the Wisconsin delegation at Chicago, pre
sided over the conference, and C. M.
Ewing, chairman of the Illinois executive
committee, was elected secretary. A
large batch of letters and telegrams show
ing that Eastern and other States were
represented in spirit was read.
That Chicago would not be considered
as the place for holding the sound-money
Democratic National Convention was the
opinion expressed after the conference by
the members ot the committee. The
choice is apparently between Detroit and
Indianapolis. General Bragg of Wiscon
sin was added to the committee appointed
by the chair.
Minnesota In Lino.
BT. PAUL, Minn., July 23.â Four hun
dred sound-money Democrats attended
the conference here to-day called by
Daniel W. Lawler, Democratic National
Committeeman for Minnesota. A resolu
tion was adopted favoring the nomination
of a third ticket. Eighteen delegates were
named to a National convention should
one oe called.
NORTHERN PACIFIC AFFAIRS.
stockholder* Will Be Protected Under
forced Sale of the Road.
MILWAUKEE. Wis., July 23.â 1n the
United States Circuit Court yesterday
Judge Jenkins denied the motion of Ar
mour, Paton et al. of New York for an in
junction impounding the proceeds which
will go to the stockholders of the Northern
Pacific road under the forced sale. The
decree concerning the final sale of the road
was agreed upon by the attorneys of all
interested parties.
The court reserves the right to resell any
of the property conveyed, or to appoint a
receiver if the reorganized company fails
to carry out the conditions imposed by the
final order.
The nominal bid for the road will be
$12,500,000. the property being divided into
three parcels. The consideration actually
to be delivered to the special master will
consist of $500,000 o/ general second mort
gage bonus, $2,000,000 of consolidated
mortgage bonds and $300,000 of general
third mortgage bonds.
Receiver for a Bank.
OMAHA, Nkbb., July 23. â Judge
Keyser this morning appointed Thomas
McKague receiver for the German Savings
Bank with bonds fixed at $60,000. The
court instructed the receiver to make dili
gent effort to pay the liabilities with the
assets on hand, and if after a reasonable
length of time he found this could not be
done, the court would order suit to be
brought against the stockholders for the
amount due the depositors. It is believed
by the State Bank Examiner that the
assets would more tnan cover the
liabilities.

GLORY OF FATHER
ZEUS RIVALED,
G. G. Matthews, the Wichita
Rainmaker, Produces
Downpours.
WATERS HOT PRAIRIES
Kansas People Marvel at the
Wonderful Result of the
Experiments.
USE OF MYSTERIOUS GASES.
Clouds Compelled to Form and Easily
Turned Into a Great Storm
Center.
WICHITA, Kaits., July 23.â 1n ancient
times, when Father Zeus eat on Mount
Olympus and with beck or nod sent the
gods about their business, he little
dreamed that in a later age his glory
would be rivaled and his power surpassed
by a mortal man, but this very miracle
has come to pass. George G. Matthews,
"The Wichita Rainmaker," has only to
uncork his mysterious chemicals and send
the resultant gases skyward and straight
way history repeats itself, for at his call
not only does the rumbling chariot of
Zeus again clatter-across the heavens, but
Vulcan slings his firebolts and Neptune
breaks up the fountains of the great deep,
and the gods of the four winds dash great
niagaras of rain on the fevered prairies,
till even the bullfrogs raise a guttural pro
test.
If Matthews is not a bona fide success as
a rain engineer, it is certain that the lucky
star under which he was born is still sus
pended in space directly above him, for,
whether directly resulting from his ex
periments or coming by merest chance,
the rains do come every time he goes after
them. Last year many people scoffed at
his pretensions, but the unvarying regu
larity with which rains have followed his
rainmaking tests has gained hundreds of
converts to his theory.
Alexander McAdie, writing in the Popu
lar Science Monthly of September, 1895,
said: "Rainmakers of our time bang and
thrash the air, hoping to cause rain by
concussion. They may well be compared
to impatient children hammering on reser
voir walls in a vain endeavor to make the
water flow. Rain-control is a scientific
possibility. Successful rain engineers will
come in time, we venture to predict, from
the ranks of those who study and clearly
understand the physical processes of cloud
formation. Cloudland, for a realm so near
us and so closely associated with our wel
fare, has been sadly slighted by man's
genius."
Mr. Matthews is not a traveling mounte
bank, but one of the solid business men
of Wichita, being a member of the hard
ware firm of Bissantz & Matthews, and
the fact that he has spent hundreds of
dollars of his own money in carrying on
the experiments is evidence that he is
working in good faith. He is a thorough
student of meteorology and a keen ob
server of meteorological conditions.
The procesg of "banging and thrashing
the air," referred to by Mr. McAdie as the
one employed by present-day "rain
makers," is regarded by Matthews as
entirely ineffectual. His plan is quite
different. The mysterious gas is released
from four large jars filled with chemicals,
and passing up through four funnels into
a central pipe, escapes into the air. It is
warm, almost colorless, and ascends rery
rapidly.
When It reaches a height of from 5000 to
8000 feet, the height to which it ascends
depending on the condition of the atmos
phere and point of operation, it turns cold
instantly and descends with a rush, cre
ating a vacuum, into which the moisture
contained in the air rushes, forming
clouds, and they in turn form the storm
center. When the usual amount of ma
terial is used, Mr. Matthews states that it
id possible to affect an area 125 miles in
diameter. A still larger territory may be
affected if the proportions are increased.
The size of the storm, he says, depends
upon the velocity and direction of the
wind, together with the temperature.
Matthews does not claim the ability to
produce rains at any and all times, but he
does claim that nature can be materially
assisted and rain be made to fall many
times when it would not otherwise.
"It is necessary in order to bring rain,"
said be, "that there be two sets of clouds,
the cold or ice cloud and the vapor clond.
The 'ice clouds' are the clouds noticeable
while the experiments are in progress,
long-lined and white and forming in the
upper strata of the air."
The "ice clouds" cool the atmosphere be
low them, forming cumulus clouds, and
when the latter condense rain falls. Much
has been written in condemnation of
Matthews by religious cranks, who regard
bis experiments as insults flung in the face
of the most high. A favorite text used by
these people is that found in the Book of
Malachi, 3:8-9. "Will a man rob God? Yet
ye hare robbed me," they quote, but
Matthews only pours more chemicals into
his big earthen jars, and the croakers are
compelled to run for shelter before the
drenching chemical rain overtakes them.
CALI FORNIA FRUIT IN LONDON.
JFour Thoutand Jtoxe* of Pear* and
Plum* Arrive in Pine Condition.
LONDON, Eng., July 23.â The Cali
fornia fruit consignment, consisting of
4000 boxes of pears and plums, which
were shipped on board the American line
steamer St. LouiÂ«, arrived in excellent
condition. The sale of the fruit will take
place at Covent Garden market to
morrow. The fruit was consigned to
Messrs. Isaac & Son, who expect that
purchasers will be readily found at good
prices. Very little French fruit has
arrived in this market as yet, and as that
is the only fruit that the California
product has to compete with sharply it is
believed that the prices will be far above
those of last year if the California fruit
arrives in as good condition as tab con
signment.
YARDE-BULLER DIVORCE SUIT.
Opening of the Celebrated Case in a High
Court of Justice.
LONDON, Eng., July 23.-The trial of
the action for divorce brought by Hon.
Walter Yarde-Buller against his wife,
formerly Miss Kirkham, daughter of
General R. W. Kirkbum of San FranciÃco,
began in tbe Probate, Divorce and Ad
miralty division of the High Court of Jus
tice to-day. The plaintiff alleges cruelty
and adultery, naming Valentine Gadesden
of San Francisco as co-respondent. The
defendant denies the allegation and makes
counter charges.
Mr. Yarde-Buller sets forth that he was
married to Miss Kirkbam in 1886. Shortly
after their marriage he found that his wife
was addicted to drink, and after their re
turn to England she repeatedly threatened
to stab him to death and frequently
struck him. The adultery charged, the
plaintiff alleges, was committed at his
home in Devonshire while Gadesden was
his guest.
The plaintiff on the witness-stand de
nied that his domestic troubles were due
to his own drinking habits or that he had
ever struck his wife as she accused him of
having done.
SANDRINGHAM E N FETE.
The JWtrfy Wedded Prince and Prinoeti
Welcomed to Their Home.
LONDON, Eng., July 23.â The village of
Sandringham, the country seat of the
Prince of Wales, was en fete to-day in
honor of the marriage of the Princess
Maud of Wales and Prince Charles of Den
mark. The newly married pair received a
veritable country welcome when they
arrived last evening, and to-day they are
waited on by deputations of the villagers,
who presented them with addresses of con
gratulation and numerous wedding offer
ings.
. Subsequently the Princess Maud and
her husband drove through Sandringham
and inspected the triumphal arches and
decorations. The Princess wore her "go
ing away gown," which was something
unique in the modiste's line. It was of
pale blue-gray canvas, lined with pale blue
and pink shot silk. The bodice had a deep
folded belt of black satin falling in a little
bow at the left side, with pointed revers of
black satin edged with grasslawn euipure.
The vest and collar were of blue and white
glace and chine silk, flowered with pink
roses. The head dress was a burnt straw
toque with puckered brim, into which
were tucked clusters of fresh-cut shaded
pink roses, the trimming being finished
with a full pink and white osprey at the
back.
LI HUNG CHANG COMING
The Distinguished Chinese States
man to Be Magnificently
Entertained.
To Be Met at New York by Old-
Time Ministers and Diplomatic
Acquaintances.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 23.â The
present indications are that when Li
Hung Chang arrives in this country a
few weeks hence the Embassador will be
entertained magnificently, not alone by
the National and State authorities, but by
a committee of distinguished citizens wbo,
because of past residence in the Orient or
because of their estimate of the Chinese
statesman, are desirous of paying him the
profoundest respect.
The importance of this purely civic
compliment will be fully appreciated by
Li Hung Chang, because he is acquainted
with every member of the committee as it
is thus far composed.
The committee consists of John E.
Ward, Minister to China in 1858-1860; Mr.
Seward, who was Minister from 1875 until
1880; John Russell Young, who was Min
ister from 1882 to 1886; John L. Cadwalla
der, who was Assistant becretarv of State
with Mr. Fish, and who visited China
thereafter, receiving personal attentions
from the Viceroy; Edward L. Burlingame,
the son of the Hon. Anson Buriingame,
who was Minister to Chirm from 1860 to
1868 and thereafter tne Minister of Cnina
to various Western powers. Colonel Fred
D. Grant, who was in China with his
father, will be asked to take part in the
work of this committee, and several other
members of the old mercantile commu
nity in China, if upon inquiry of the
Viceroy it is found that he can remain
long enough in New York to take part at a
dinner to be given in his honor.
The probabilities are that the Viceroy
will remain in this city but one or two
days. His official character as the Em
bassador of China would necessitate his
almost immediate departure for Wash
ington when he lands. That he will ob
serve this principle of diplomatic cour
tesy there can be little doubt, for the
Chinese officials are most punctilious.
After visiting Washington he may revisit
New York, however, and spend a little
more time in responding to the desire of
that part of the population which will
seek to do him honor. On his way West
it is said he will make a stop, in all likeli
hood, only in Chicago. He will be enter
tained in San Francisco before he departs
for home.
PRINCE YTURBIDE'S PROTEST,
Objects to Being Expelled From Washing-
ton's Metropolitan Club Without a
Jury Trial.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 23.â Judge
Hagner yesterday decided that the issues
of fact raised in tbe case of Prince Augus
tine Yturbide of Mexico, who several
days ago prayed for a writ of mandamus
to compel the board of governors of the
Metropolitan Club to revoke their suspen
sion of him from the clud, shall be tried
in the Circuit Court before a jury.
Prince Yturbide claims he was expelled
from the club without being given an
opportunity to answer the charges that he
was guilty of conduct unbecoming a gen
tleman and a club member, it being al
leged that he was the author of defama
tory stories respectine a daughter of one
of the club members. The club claims
that he was given an opportunity to
answer the charges and that he declined
to do so. The Prince also stated to the
court to-day that he can prove by a dozen
or more witnesses that he is innocent.
TheJudfje, in disposing of the matter,
held that Prince Yturbide is entitled to a

DOW LOWERS A MARE.
The Olympic Club Cycler Rides
a Half-Mile Heat in
1:04 Flat.
TANDEM CHAMPIONSHIP WON
Accidents Are Plentiful, and Several
of the Contestants Are
Injured.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 23.â 1n the
opening night's racing of the indoor
bicycle tournament world's records and
bicycles were at a discount; accidents
were plenty, and there was considerable
growling among the professionals, who,
after witnessing the first fall, went on a
strike, but were promptly brought back
into line by the firmness of the referee,
Walter B. Fawcett, of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen.
In the first heat of the half-mile pro
fessional R. E. Dow of the Olympic
Cyclers broke the world's record by riding
in 1:04 flat, and in the one-mile tandem
George E. Dixon of the Bay Citys nnd
George M. Haralin of the San Francisco
Road Club broke the half-mile record, rid
ing in :58 1-5, and the mile record, going
the distance in 2:05 2-5.
In the first race (one mile, scratch, ama
teur) the electric lights failed for an in
stant while the riders were on the west
bank, and G. H. Crafts of the Acmes shot
headfirst into the fence. He was knocked
senseless, received a very severe scalp
wound and was carried from the hall.
Although no bones were broken, bis
riding is at an end for the present.
All of the riders in the final half-mile
scratch, professional, came to grief on the
last bank, and in the second lap W. A.
Terrill, B. C. W., went through the fence
out of the track. He was but little in
jured and he climbed back, procured an
other wheel and finished the race. This
accident was caused by the slipping of
a tire.
All the wheels were wrecked and all of
the riders more of less injured. A. N.
Jones, O. C. W., did not lose his presence ;
of mind for a minute, and as soon as he \
straightened out on the path he sprang to
his feet, seized his wreck and sprinted
nearly a lap before he procured a trailer.
The races were the best ever seen in this
city, as the men all rode to win. Follow

TRIES TO MURDER
A PORTLAND MAN,
Mrs. N. W. Spencer Shoots
at Traveling Solicitor
Singleton.
HER AIM IS FAULTY.
The Intended Victim Escapes
Unharmed and She Is
Imprisoned.
ACCUSES HIM OF POLYGAMY.
The Woman Declares She U tbe Wife
of tbe Drummer by Contract
Marriage.
PORTLAND, Ok., July 23.â N. W. Sin
gleton, formerly a drummer for Stude
baker Brothers, was shot at this afternoon
by Mrs. N. W. Spencer, who claims to be
his contract wife. The bullet missed its
mark. Mrs. Spencer is now in jail. She
claims that Singleton deserted her last
January, after sendinz her to San Fran
cisco. On the 14th of that month she, in
a fit of despondency, attempted suicide on
Ellis street.
Singleton claims to have first become
acquainted with his Nemesis in Seattle
about a year ago, when he was a com
mercial traveler. His relations with her,
he says, were not of an intimate character
â at least not intimate enough to justify
her following him about the country. Sin
gleton alleses that he frequently assisted
hÂ«r with small sums of money, and he
feiened ignorance of the cause that led to
an attempt upon his life.
Singietoa was recently married, and
when Mrs. Spencer heard of it si c came
from Seattle to compel a settlement of
some kind with him. Mrs. Spencer, or
Singleton, to-night denied that she came
from Seattle after learning of Singleton's
marriage. She claimed that she has been
here three years and was everywhere in
troduced by Singleton as his wife, which
she believed herself to be.
It is doubtful whether Singleton will
prosecute his assailant

LOST IN CATALINA WILDS
A Los Angeles Lad Suffers the
Tortures of Hunger and
Thirst
Found by Fishermen After Passing
Four Days in Mountain
Fastnesses-
AVALON, Catalina Island, July 23.â
After wandering about for four days, sub
sisting on wild cactus fruit and shellfish,
15-year-old Kenneth Powell was found
yesterday. He was in a pitiable plight,
having spent four nights in the wild and
mountainous interior of the island, and
his discovery by fishermen in a remote
spot seems almost providential. Kenneth j
ran away from his parents because of some |
boyish grievance. To-aay, ill and errsaci- !
ated from his long fast, ne was glad to j
board the little steamer that was to carry !
him back to his home in Los Angeles.
The lad tells sufferings that would have
caused the death of many hardy men.
He slept in a cave one night, and on one j
occasion was so nearly choked with thirst
that he stripped and lay down in the
water on the beach to cool bis fevered
body. The boy must have tramped fifty
miles over mountains and cliffs, through
cactus beds whose cruel needles became so
imbedded in the flesh that his legs are one
mass of festering sores. Poison oak slso
claimed him for a victim. An overhang- j
ing rock fell and struck him on the head,
cutting a deep gash, and when rescued
yesterday by some fishermen who were j
attracted by his cries from the top of a I
mountain overlooking the sea, he was a
wreck of the boy who left here last Satur
day afternoon in a fit of boyish passion,
to wander out on the trail for a time, in
tending to soon return. He left the path
and never again found it. Fortunately
the boy found a spring of water on the
second day of his wanderings; otnerwise
he would have succumbed to thirst. This
morning the boy was sent to his dome in
Los Angeles, whither his distracted
parents went in despair yesterday.

ism is taking deep root around Ortine a m
Pierce County. Many converts from the

DIEGO'S HARBOR,
Commissioner Nemoto of
Japan Pleased With Its
Advantages.
SUPERIOR TO YOKOHAMA
He Will Recommend It as the
Terminus ior the New Line
of Steamships.
SOON TO BE IN OPERATION.
Vessels May Ply From the Orient to
the Southern Port Within Six
Months.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 23.â Sho Ne
moto, commissioner of the Japanese Gov
ernment for the investigation of commerce
and industry, arrived in San Diego to-day
in the interests of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha,
or Oriental Navigation Company, which
purposes making San Diego its terminus
on this side of the Pacific. A delegation
of business men of this city, with a num
ber of officials of the Santa Fe Railroad
Company, met Mr. Nemoto at Los Angeles
and accompanied him to this city.
Mr. Nemoto has in his power to report
favorably or unfavoraDly to his Govern
ment regarding the advantages of San
Diego for the terminus of the Toyo Kisen
Kaisha steamship line, and upon his re
port depends the Government subsidy to
that line." He said to-day to a Call corre
spondent:
"You may be assured that my report
will be favorable to San Diego. I am
delighted with the natural advantages of
this harbor. It is much superior to Yoko
hama. Tne line, you can say, will come
to Ban Diego. I consider it settled. San
Diego is the natural port for Japanese
goods on their way to Chicago and New
York. The climate and topography of
the country favor commerce through this
harbor. Mr. Asano, president of the
Toyo Kisen Kaisha, will arrive here two
weeks hence and he will make public the
plans of the company. I am not con
nected with the company, but represent
the Government only.
"The company has a capital of $6,000,000
ard has already bought six steamers
carrying from 4000 to 6000 tons of cargo
each. These steamers will call at the
Sandwich Islands and compete for their
share of the rich Hawaiian commerce so
largely in the hands of the Japanese.
"They will also run down the Mexican
coast as far as San Benito, Chiapas, touch
ing at the principal ports. Ido not know
positively that the steamship company as
a company has a contract with the Santa
Fe, but I know it has an understanding on
rate#. The Santa Fe is prepared to give a
through rate for Japanese goods to Chi
cago and New York, and it will land cotton
and flour here at rates that will make it
profitable for the steamship company to
handle these products. We need iron also,
but I believe it will be found in Lower
California in the Tepustete fields, which
my Government has investigated some
what. I am much pleased with the result
of my visit."
Toraji Kusakado, representative of the
Japanese Colonization Association, is the
companion of Mr. Nemoto, his object being
the purchase of a large tract of land in the
State of Chiapas, Mexico, where a colony
of Japanese will be located, and which will
be the Central American terminus of the
steamship line.
The Japanese were guests of a company
of San Diego business men. who took them
out on the bay in the lighthouse tender
Madrone and beyond the Government
jetty at the mouth of the harbor. All pos
sible information touching the advantages
of the harbor, as well as wharfage facili
ties, was sought by Mr. Nemoto, who had
numerous confidential conferences with
the Santa Fe officials regarding rates for
landing raw cotton from Southern States
at San Diego. Mr. Nemoto intimated that
the line would be established within six
months.
The Japanese will be shown over the
city to-morrow, and will leave in the
afternoon for the City of Mexico and
Chiapas and to inspect the Tehuantepec
Railway. Mr. Nemoto will then proceed
to Chile and Peru in the interests of his
Government.
Seattle's Chances Xot Made Known.
SEATTLE, Wash., July 23.â Having
enjoyed the freedom of the city last night
and to-day and been shown the advan
tages of Seattle as a terminus, the
Japanese quartet of promoters of trans
pacific steamship lines departed for
Tacoma this evening. They expressed
themselves as well pleased, but gave no
intimation of Seattle's chances of securing
the prize. President Asano is armed with
many letters of recommendation and in
troductions, in several of which he is re
ferred to as '*one of the biggest financiers
and operators in Japan."
HONORED BY VISALIANS,
Non-Partisan Reception Given to
Democratic Chairman
Alford.
Conveyed From Tulare on a Special
Train and Congratulated by
Hundreds.
VISALIA, Cal., July 23.â Hon. W. H.
Afford, chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee, was given a non-par
tisan reception upon his arrival in Visalia
this evening, which, for enthusiasm and
good feeling, has never been equaled in
Tulare County. When the people of Tu
lare City beard that he was to be given
this reception, they telephoned over to
Visalia and insisted that they be per
mitted to share in honoring the brilliant
young leader of the Democratic party.
Mr. .Alford was met at the Goshen and
was escorted to Tulare City, where hun
dreds of people were in waiting to offer
congratulations and shake his hand. His
party found a special train was ready to
start to Visalia. When it arrived here
the streets were crowded with people, and
hrecracKers were bein* exploded and a
band discoursed patriotic music. Crowds
gathered around Mr. Alford and offered
congratulations.
Calls for Alford were answered by that
gentleman, who went to the balcony oi
tne Palace Hotel, which had been decor
ated with flags and ounting, where he de
livered a short and eloquent spet > h and
was enthusiastically applauded. He said
he had received congratulations {romman
prominent in the Democratic and other
parties upon his election as chairman of
the State committee, but this ma mticent
gathering of his friends and neighbors
pleased him more than all else. When he
concluded, three rousing cheers were
given for Alford and the throng again
pressed forward to extend greeting.

children. The family came to this
State several years ago and took up its
residence on a ranch near Alum Rock,
where the head of the family engaged in

eldest son came to this city, where she
has since resided. All efforts on the part
of her husband to have her return to her
family were futile.

SAN BERNARDINO'S QUEER SUIT.
Peculiar Phase of California Law Ds-
rel oped in the Smith Case.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., July 23.â A
peculiar phase of California law was de
veloped in the courts here to-day. Arm
stead Smith was arrested in May last for
threatening an assault on W. Maguire.
He was committed to jail in default of
$1000 bond, and to-day it was developed
under habeas corpus proceedings that,
being unable to give the bond, Smith was
liable to remain in the jail during the
term of his natural life. The California
code provides that a Justice of the Peace
may fix tue bond at any sum not exceed
ing $5000 for a threatened assault, and
under the law there is no way of getting
the defendant out of jail.
It was during the habeas corpus pro
ceedings that this point was brought up
and the defendant released. It is held by
attorneys that sections 701 to 714 of the
code are clearly unconstitutional.

328 South Broadway, >
Los Angeles, Cal., July 23. )
The saJe to-day of the property of the
Semi-tropic Land and Water Company,
near Colton, in San Bernardino County,
marks the failure of one of the most
promising land subdivision schemes ever
projected in Southern California. In the
struggle to consummate its plans the
company has been involved in extensive
litigation. This has been brought to an
end by the disposal ot 18,000 acres of land
by auction under foreclosure of the San
Francisco Savings Union. The company
negotiated a loan of $300,000, which was
subsequently reduced to about $263,000,
and it was for this loan that the mortgage
was foreclosed. The land was bid in by
the Savings Union, except for tracts pur
chased by small holders.
The company sold many small tracts to
settlers, some of whom paid in full and
obtained a release for their land. The
larger number were unable to do this, and
they are now the losers. The Savings
Union people offered to accept the balance
due from each of the owners of these
small holdings, but very few of them were
able to meet the requirements and con
sequently will lose their homes and the
work of several years.
LOWER CALIFORNIA GOLD.
Capitalists Investigating a Strike Aear
the Gulf.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., July 23.âConsid
erable talk has been going on here in
mining circles of late regarding rich strikes
of gold in Lower California. Several Lcs

investigation of a mine on the gulf side,
about seventy-five miles south of En
senada. A schooner left San Pedro to-day
with a crew of twelve men aboard. They
will touch at San Diego, and from there
will sail into the Gnlf of California. Bur
ros will be used to carry ore from the mine
to the schooner. About lifty tons will be
brought to this city, * where it will be
tested. If it should average $30 a ton the
mine will be purchased by the capitalists.

SANTA CRUZ ENCAMPMENT.
The Ministerial Association Concludes Its
Labors â Women Planning Mis
sionary Work.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., July 23.â The Min
isterial Association atGarfield Park closed
its session to-day. Rev. E. W. Matthews
of San Francisco read a paper on the Chris
tian Endeavor movement and the special
work of the Christian church, wherein he
taught that their aims were identical, and
advised the church to resist any effort
that might be made for a denominational
society for the young people. The Chris
tian Endeavor, he said, had the right creed
and name.
The Woman's Board of Missions, which
has in charge much of the home and for
eign mis"ion work of the church, opened
its session at 1:30 r. m. with devotional
exercises, led by Miss May iiateman. Mrs.
fa. G. Hartley of Butte City is president
and MrÂ«. Ella Cutler of Irvington sec
retary. The president's address showed
that the society had keenly felt the pinch
ing of hard times, but had not been com
pelled to curtail its work, not one of its
missionaries being called from the field.
The number in foreign lands had been in
creased, and this fall they hoped to enter
several new countries.
Mrs. J. F. Tout of Hollister read a paper
on "Individual Work." Mrs. L. A. Pier of
Willows delivered an address on "District
Development," incidentally showing how
she had organized the women in three
counties.
Rev. James Small of Oakland preached
eloquently last night to a large congrega
tion on "Christ's Estimate of Man."
PRESNO CARRIERS UNDER FIRE.
Charges filed by a Secret Agent of the
Postal Department.
FRESNO, Cal., July 23. â The mail
carriers of Fresno Poatoffice are under the
fire of secret service agents of the Postal
Department. A few days ago the carriers
received notices from Washington inform
ing them of instances where they had been
derelict in their duties. After much in
vestigation the distributors of mail have
learned that a secret agent was in this city
last May following the vocation of a book
agent.
Fault had been fonnd with all but one
of the carriers. Some are charged with
loitering on their routes and holding
pleasant chats, while others, it is alleged,
did not gather mail from many distant
boxes in the city on each of their trips.
Some are charged with falsifying the
r cord of time when they reported on and
off duty. The carriers are at present en
gaged in formulating answers to the com
plaints, and they claim that they can ex
plain matters satisfactorily.
The Government did not institute the
Secret Service Department until the pres
ent administration took charge of affairs.
I It is claimed that Republican carriers are
made to suffer most by the system of
espionage.
SLAVERY IN CHINA.
Millions of Girls An Sold on the Block
While They Are Still in Their
Infancy.
BEATTLE, Wash., July 23.-Rev. J. E.
Adams, a Chinese missionary, writing
from Hongkong to a friend in this city,
says:
"Slavery and polygamy seem to be
twins, and they go hand in band to-day in
China. There are millions of polygamous
houses in China and millions of slaves.
Even in the Chinese quarters of cities whicb
are owned by European Governments, such
as Hongkong, Singapore, Penane, Macao,
Manilla, Batavia and Delhi, slavery is al
most as prevalent as in China proper.
Slavegirls are purchased from their
parents or guardians when they are quite
young. From 3 to 7 years is the favorite
age in the market, as the child when
stripped shows how it will look when fully
grown. The price is then quite low, rang
ing from $10 to $16, and the danger of the
child becoming homesick and running
away amounts to nothing. They are
treated kindly, and at 15 are olten ad
mirable housekeepers. They receive no
wages, of course, and as for lodgings, they
are supposed to sleep â well, anywhere â
on two chairs, a board, a stone bench or a
tile floor. A great many girls are sold into
immorality by their parents annually, and
go into the lowest dens in the Orient.
"Girl slavery has been favored by the
Chinese for many centuries, and is an or
ganic feature of their civilization. It ex
tends from the imperial household in
Peking down to the lowest coolie family.
A San Francisco merchant of good social
and financial standing has three beautiful
daughters who belong to one of the worst
dens in Hongkong. Their mother was a
slave he owned while here sixteen years
ago." _
ALL TACOMA AROUSED,
Large Reward Offered for the
Apprehension of Ballot
Thieves.
Business Men Combine to Stamp
Out Lawlessness in the
City.
TACOMA, Wash., July 23.â The robbing
of the ballot-boxes in the City Controller's
vaults, coming as the culmination of a
series ot dishonest transactions in the
public affairs oi Tacoma, has resulted in
thoroughly arousing the city. A meeting
of bankers -and other business men was
held this afternoon, at which a resolution
was passed urging the City Council to
adopt vigorous measures to apprehend the
ballot-box thieves.
A masvmeeting has been called for Fri
day afternoon, at which time the business
men will probably organize for the pur
pose of stamping out such lawlessness.
Citizens of all classes, without regard to
their interest in the mayoralty fight, de
clare this crime to be the worst yet perpe
trated upon this long-auffering commu
nity.
The City Council held a special meeting
to-night and after rigorous addresses,
passed an ordinance appropriating $1000
to reward the man who hunts down and
convicts the guilty men. It is believed at
least five men were cenoerned â one who
planned the job, two who broke through
the wall into the vault and at least two
watchers. The general supposition is that
the perpetrators had some interest in the
continuance of the present administration.
Two weeks ago Janitor Blanchard found
at the top of a Sack stairway two crowbars,
partly covered with brickdust, and the
prints of bare feet. A few days later
another crowbar had been added. He
I called the attention of Commissioner of
! Public Works Doherty to them, and it is
I considered strange that the latter did not
begin an investigation.
He told Blanchard the tools must belong
to the city electricians.
After long arguments to-day on the
question of counting the remaining bal
lots, Judge Pritchnrd decided that the
count should go on. The ballots of otic
precinct were counted. Controller Ben
ham testified that further investigation
disclosed that the seals on the ballots of
five or six more precincts had been broken.
It is believed now that the official returns
will be admitted as evidence for the pre
cincts of which the ballots were stolen.
Four of these precincts pave Orr a majority
of 108 votes, bo tnat by counting them out
Mayor Fawcett's majority would be 110.
GERMAN SOCIALISTS MOBBED.
Hot Reception of Delegates to the Con-
gv*s at Lille.
PARIS, France, July 23.â A Socialist
congress is in progress at Lille and to-day
there arrived in that city to take part in
the proceedings a number of German
delegates. The French delegates went to
the railway station to receive and welcome
the Germans and their presence attracted
a crowd.
When the German, delegates appeared
outside the station they found that the
crowd had prepared a welcome of its own
for them. They were greeted with hoots
and jeers and cries of "Down with Ger
many! Lone live France 1"
A scrimmage ensued in which several
persons were injured. The police were
SDeediiy on'the scene and restored oider
without much difficulty. The disturbance
was entirely due to the French popular
feeling against everything German.
The Dundonald Safe.
QTJEENBTOWN, Iceland, July 23.â The
British bark Dundonald, Captain Girvan,
from San Francisco March 10 for Hull,
previously reported as having been in
collision with the British steamer Penarth,
via Madeira for Manaos, sinking the latter

has arrived here. Her bows were stove in
by the collision ana her spars and fore
peak carried away. She is also leaking
badly and her hold is full of water. The
captain and crew of the sunken steamer
Santarez are on board the Duudonald.
Spanish Confirmation of Maceo's Death.
HAVANA, Cuba, July 23.â it is now
known that Jose Maceo was killed during
an engagement of the insurgent forces un
der nis command with the Spanish troops

insurgents were defeated.
Insolvent Australian Bank.
LONDON, Eng., July 23.â A petition
has been presented to the English courts
asking for the winding up of the Commer
cial Bank of Australia, on the ground that

Native Sons and Daughters
Picnic at Goodwater

GAY OUTING AT NIGHT.
The Admission Day Fund Swelled
by the Proceeds of a Mid
summer Revel.
DANCE BENEATH LUNA'S BATS
Speed Contest of Cyclers Astride
of Gayly Illuminated
Wheels.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 23.â There never
was in the history of Stockton so many of
the leading social lights of this city at
Goodwater Grove as to-night, the occasion
being the moonlight picnic and bop of the
Native Sons. The affair was devised to
raise funds to defray the expenses of the
water carnival on Admission day, and it
proved to be a success beyond the expecta
tions of the most sanguine. The night
was one of those perfect ones for which
Stockton is noted, and hundreds of maids
in white muslins, mulls and lawns grouped
about under the lantern-decked boughs of
the giant oaks at the grove lent beauty to
the scene. Before 9 o'clock there were
over 1000 people in the grove and every
car brought more until the time for home
going, near midnight.
The scene on entering the grove gate
was like a glimpse into fairyland. The
branches and boughs of the great oat
trees had been hung with hundreds of
Japanese lanterns, which vied with the
electric lights to dispel the darkness until
the moon loomed up aid cast its beams
of approval upon the merry gathering be
neath the oaks.
There was a concert by a picked band
that lasted from 8 until 9:30 o'clock, and
while the band was discoursing pleasing
music the throng promenaded about the
walks or occupied the settees that cover
the ground between the clubhouse and
the dancing pavilion. Here and there
were booms, where sweet-faced Native
Daughters dispensed cooling drinks or
sold popcorn and icecream. They plied a
thriving trade and added many a dollar to
the carnival fund.
During the evening the Terminal City
Wheelmen came to the picnic in a body
with their wheels decorated with Japa
nese lanterns. They formed in line and
paraded about the grounds, after which
they went out to the track at the erove
and raced by the light of their own lan
terns.
The affair was a success financially, as
well as socially, for the carnival fund was
increased by many hundreds of dollars.
STEAMER LINES CUT RATES.
San Francisco- Stockton Hound Trip Mow
\' , Costs but 25 Cent*.
STOCKTON,' Cal., July 23.â A lively
passenger rate war is on between the lines
of river steamers plying between here and
San Francisco. The fare has been uniform
on both lines up to a few days ago, when
the _ Old ; â the California Navigation
and Improvement' Company â cut the rate
in half, making the price for the trip on
the river 25 cents, the charge for a berth
25 cents and 50 cents for a stateroom.'
This afternoon the Union Transportation
Company, the new } line, put ; the price
down to "25 cents for the round trip be
tween this city and San Francisco. Every
body now looks for a rate war such as was
waged eight or nine years ago, when both
lines would < almost j pay a man for riding
with them rather than let the opposition
get his patronage. To-morrow the old
line will probably meet to-day's cut and
go it one better. , ' . ' ,
NEGEOES CLAIM THE CHILD.
Bitter Contest for the I'otsetsion of a
White Girl.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 23.â Domingo
G. Pena to-day applied to the police for
assistance in getting the clothing of his
15-year-old niece, Juan a Garcia, from a
house on California street that is kept by
negroes. The girl had been placed with
them for safe keeping, believing that she
would be- well cared for, her relatives,
Pena and his wife, being too poor to sup
port her. Several days ago they secured
a home for her in the family of a Stockton
attorney, but she refused to go, saying she
preferred to stay with her negro friends.
Yesterday Pena induced her to go with
him to the cemetery, where his brother,
who lives in the mountains, was waiting,
and they forcibly took the girl to the home
of the brother. The negroeÃ are deter
mined to get the girl back, and so refused
to give up her clothing.
The Result of a Vivid Imagination,
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 23.â The story
published some few days ago stating that
Henry Nuttman and wife and twelve chil
dren of Santa Clara were just recovering
from an illness caused by using milk from
a cow affected with tuberculosis appears
to have proceeded from a person possessed
of a most vivid imagination. There has
been no illness in Mr. Nuttman's family
except that Mrs. Nuttman has been a suf
ferer from Bright's disease, though fortu
nately her condition is now much im
proved.
Minister bpulltr Dead.
PARIS, France, Juiy 23.â Senator Se

born December 8, 1835.
SOCIALIST P OLITICAL CLUBS.
Orgr&nization* Effected in the Twenty-
Eighth and Twenty-Ninth Districts.
The Socialists of the Twenty-ninth As
sembly District met last evening in Irish-
American Hall and organized the Twenty
ninth Assemby District Club of the Social
ist Labor party. C. H. Davies was selected
as secretary. C. Solomonson was selected
as the temporary chairman and financial
secretary, also as delegate to the County
Committee.
It was decided that the club shall meet
every first and third Thursday evening of
each month at 287 Natoma street. Solo
monson was directed to make an arrange
ment for a district mass-meeting, and
Davis was appointed to mate arrangements
for holding open-air meetings on con
venient streets from now until the elec
tion.
The socialists of the Twenty-eighth met
in the same hall and formed the Twenty
eighth Assembly District of the Socialist
Labor party. W. Bean was selected as re
cording secretary and delegate to the
County Committee. F. Schiller was se
lected as recording secretary. It was de
cided to meet on the second and fourth
Monday evenings of each month.
COLORED DEMOCRATS.
They Issue a Public Challenge to
Republican Orators for a De-
bate on Party Questions.
The colored Democrats are coming to
the front, and seem ready to vouch for
the courage of their convictions, to judge
from the subjoined communication:
Ban Fkancisoo, Cal., July 23, 1896.
Editor of The Callâ Sir: The Republican daily
press of this City have devoted much space of
lute to the theatricals of the local colored Re
publican clubs of the City, Â«the presumed
intention being to create an impression
that the colored men of this State
are not alive to the issues of the dny
which confront them in common with the
rest of the Nation; but that on the contrary
they are still willinc to be led to the music of
the demagogues of the Republican party, who
alone profit by the fealty of the colored vote.
Believing that such an impression should
not be allowed 10 pass unnoticed, and on be
half of a large body of young and independent
thinkers of this State and ofthe United States,
we hereby publicly challenge the Republiaus
of this City to produce two men (we draw no
color line) who will meet us in joint debate
on the issues of the present campaign and
their relation 10 the interests of the colored
men of the country, the debate to take
Dlace at Metropolitan Temple at an
early date and tinder the auspices of
the State central committees of the Repub
lican and Democratic parties, the representa
tives of the side losing the debate to defray
the expense of the meeting. Respectfully,
Cornelitts A. Hughes,
President Ticonderoga Club.
George W. Dennis Jr.,
Ex-Member Democratic State Committee.
If this challenge be accepted a lively
and most interesting debate may be looked
for. Mr. Dennis has made a special
study of the subject of free coinage, while
Mr. Hughes is an eloquent and powerful
advocate of a low tariff. These well
known colored orators will endeavor to
show the voters of their race that the
Democratic platform is safest and strong
est to stand npon. The outcome of the
challenge is looked for with much interest.
THEIR HOMES IN
CHINESE DENS,
How Fifty White Women
and Girls Spend Their
Lives.
SOME IN THEIR TEENS.
Society for the Suppression of
Vice Will Be Asked
to Act.
DIRECT VIOLATION OF LAW.
Dens Scattered Through the Streets
and Alleys in China
town.
An investigation made yesterday dis
closed the fact that about fifty white
women and girls are living in various dens
in Chinatown in plain violation ot law.
The matter will immediately be brought to
the attention of the Society for the Sup
pression of Vice.
So debased are the lives these women
are leading, and many of them girls in
their teens at that, that the region where
this illicit traffic is carried on might well
be called "In Darkest Chinatown." The
principal districts in which this deplorable
state of affairs exists are: Dupont street,
Waverly and Oneida places, Brooklyn
alley and Sacramento street.
The law in reference to the matter is
very plain â so plain that it will be an easy
task to fix the blame on the persons re
sponsible. Order No. 2191, given in "gen
eral orders of the Board of Supervisors,"
reads as follows:
Section 1. No person shall, in that portion
of the City and County of San Francisco
bounded by the north side of California street,
east side of Powell street, west side of Kearny
street and the north side of Broadway, keep
or maintain or become an inmate of or visitor
to or shall in any way contribute to the support
of any disorderly house or house of ill fame,
or knowingly to let or underlet or transfer the
possession of any premises for use by any per
son for any of the said purposes, or to permit
any premises to be occupied or used by any
person or persons for any of such purpoEos
after he shall have notice of such occupation
and use..
Sec. 2. Any person violating any of the
provisions of tnis order shall be deemed guilty
of misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof,
be punished by a fine of not less than $250,
nor exceeding $1000, or by imprisonment not
less than three months, nor exceeding six
montns, or by both such fine and imprison
ment.
Despite this stringent order of the board,
it is a notorious fact that there are white
women and girls now engaged in the
business placed under the ban.
Many of these women, especially the
young girls, do not make the dens a per
manent residence. They go to them early
in the evening and leave about midnight.
On whom the blame for this infamous
traffic will fall is not known, but it is un
derstood that the Society for the Suppres
sion of Vice will endeavor to check the
evil and bring those directly responsible
to punishment.
The attention of the investigators was
first brought to the subject by a policeman
whose regular beat is in that district, but
even he did not know the extent of the
evil. Many of the houses are well known,
others have been but recently established,
but they are but carelessly hiddenâ the
carelessness being the result of long im
munity.
They are not confined to the narrow
streets of the center of Chinatown, either,
for more than one of the infamous places
may be found on the outskirts of the
quarter, and close to where respectable
people live. There are more of the places
than any one haa any idea of, and when
the Society for the Suppression of Vice
gets to work, it will have lots to do.
Charged It to George Law.
The death of George W. Law was the
subject of a good deal of sympathetic com
ment in the Tenderloin. "The owner of a
cafe recalled an incident that occurred one
afternoon when the millionaire drove
through Twenty-eighth street. He was
evidently having a good time. A saloon
keeper, at whose place Law often stopped
happened to see him. Turning to his bar
keeper he said* "There goes George Law.
Jnst charge him $300 for wine." And the
bill was paid.â New York correspondence of

There will be no profit in free silver
without an industrial system that puts it
into circulation.
What will It profit the American work
ingman to vote for Bryan and lose his
work and wages ?
Don't forget that the political duty of
the hour is registration. See that your
friends attend to it.
If Bryan should be elected his Cabinet
would be pudding for anarchists, but poor
stuff for good citizens.
The Silver Convention was called to start
a National movement, but effected nothing
but a Democratic wiggle.
The only way to get silver into the
hands of the people is to revive industry
and the payment of wastes.
From the length of time Whitney and
his friends stay on the barbed-wire fence
it would seem they are stuck on it.
Free silver in the hands of statesmen is
one thing, but free silver in the hands of
blatherskites is quite a different affair.
McKinley is truly representative of the
patriotism, the honor and the dignity of
American manhood; but what does Bryan
represent?
A good party chorus for the middle-of
the-road Populists would be the words of
the old song: "Shove her up, shove her
up to the bolt"
In asking the Democrats of the Fifth
District to wash his dirty linen for him,
Mr. Kelly should furnish them with the
soap, or at least with the lye.
California needs protection more than
she needs silver, as she has gold enough
to run ail her industries aa soon an they
are made profitable by protection.
The r-samine-i says that while Bryan has
no war record he has been campaigning in
Nebraska, but it neglects to add that his
last campaign there ended in a "Waterloo.
Before any man decides to trust Demo
cratic promises this year he had better
consider what resulted from trusting tbe
promises of the same party four years ago.
By the time gold Dug Daggett gets
through bossing the silver Democrats they
won't know whether they have been
through a campaign or a threshing
machine.
All the enthusiasm of the campaign so
far has been on the side of the Repub
licans, but perhaps the Democrats will
begin shouting a little later on, when they
see they are about to be run over.
There may be a few silver Republicans
who have bolted the party because they
are too impatient to wait for international
bimetallism, but there will not be enough
of them to be missed on election day.
As the Democratic organs and orators
have begun denouncing all the business
men of the country as plutocrats, it would
be interesting to know from what class of
citizens they expect to get votes for their
party.
From the absence of any sound of
crowing in the Democratic camp this year
it would seem that ali the roosters must
have been eaten during tbe time the party
has lived in ciover with the four years of
Grover.
The gold Democrats are talking of mak
ing a ticket of Palmer of Illinois and Gor
don of Georgia on the principle probably
that as both are political back numbers it
might be just as well to start a graveyard
with them.
The issue that affects the farms, the forges
and the firesides of the country is a return
of good prices for all products and good
wages for labor, and every man who
possesses any reasoning faculty knows
that these can be accomplished only by
restoring statesmen to office and establish
ing a protective system.
Senator F.'.kins, who has been a large
producer of silver for sixteen years, and is,
of course, in favor of the largest possible
use of silver, cannot stand the Chicago
ticket or the Chicago platform. "Free eov
ernment," he declares, "cannot exist with
these forces in the ascendency. The party
that adopts such a platform is getting
ready to die, or tbe Republic is."
All sincere 1 Populists object to sur
rendering their < principles and their. party
organization to the Chicago ticket are de
nounced by Democrats nas bolters { and
bribe-takers, and v thus does Democracy
make enemies among the very men whose
friendship it needs. As an illustration of
Democratic incapacity to do the right
thing at the - right time this slandering of

TWO PROPOSITIONS.
Mr. Bryan continues to inform the pub
lic, from one to three times a day, that
"the Republican party declared that the
gold standard should be maintained until
something better conld be substituted for
it." That "something," Mr. Bryan says,
is "bimetallism," which means that "the
Republican party is for bimetallism."
The Republican party will not object to
being called a "bimetallic party," for that
is exactly what it is, but it does not pro
pose to disestablish the present monetary
system until there is something better
well in hand lo substitute for it. Mr.
Bryan's plans differ from the Republican
plan of securing bimetallism, in that he
would first â¢verthrow the existing system
and then set about finding something to
take its place, and, meanwhile, let com
merce and industry shift for themselves.
Bnt Mr. Bryan is unfair, in that he does
not ada, when he says the Republican
party is for bimetallism, that its platform
â¢eclares very emphatically that tbe party
"is unreservedly for sound money." He
could not do that, nowever, for he would
then admit that his party is for unsound
money, which it is. In quoting from the
Republican platform Mr. Bryan's purpose
is to show that the difference between his
party and the Republican party on the
money question is in choosing methods to
reach a common end, and in that he is
quite ri*ht. His party is for bimetallism,
as is the Re publican party, but his plan
would work to first establish silver mono
metallism by driving gold out of the
monetary system. He wonld try to create
a value for silver twice as high as the
commerce of the world is willing to admit
it possesses.
Mr. Bryan denies that supply has any
thing to do with values. They should be
fixed by a governmental edict. He refuses
to see that with a total world's silver pro
duction of 01,000,000 ounces in 1873 the sil
ver in an American dollar bad a market
value of $1 03 tosl 04, and that in 1895 the
enormous production of 105,000,000 ounces
were put upon the market and that the
price fell to 53 cents for the quantity con
tained in a silver dollar, because of the
preat increase in tbe supply of white metal.
Had Mr. Bryan's theories anything prac
tical in them the increase in ounces pro
duced would not hare been confronted by
a decrease in value. In 1894 the United
States produced, in round numbers, 170,
-000,000 bushels of potatoes, which sold at
an average price of 53 cents a bushel, but
in 1895 the production ran up to over 400,
-000,000 bushels, and tbe price dropped to
L'(l cents a bushel. Had Mr. Bryan been
President in 1895, with the machinery of
Government running in harmony with his
economic theories, potatoes should have
sold at 53 cents a bushel instead of 26
cents, and the Amount of white metal con
tained in a silver dollar should have been
worth $1 03 to $1 04 instead of 53 cents. If
the Government by its fiat can control the
price of one product of the ground it cer
tainly can control the price of all products
of the ground. Potato-growers should
exact a pledge from Mr. Bryan that he
will not overlook their products while en
gaged in doubling the price of the products
of bills and mountains.
The Kepnblii-an party does not believe
it can, nor does it intend to try to regulate
the market price for gold, silver, potatoes
or any other article, but inasmuch as a
larger volume of redemption money is
needed to meet the increasing require
ments of the world's commerce it proposes
to bring all parties in mteiest together to
provide for this increasing money demand
by adding silver to tbe monetary system
now prevailing under an agreement that
shall make gold and silver dollars inter
changeable on their own account where
ever tbey meet in any channel or avenue
ot trade, traffic and commerce. This would
be bringing tbe two metals together upon
a common basis of employment which
â¢would make a bimetallic and the only true
bimetallic monetary system. This plan
does not contemplate the Government's
fiat, but a mutual agreement between
users of money. Bimetallism, as advo
cated by the Republican party, is a com
mon, every-day, wide-awake business
proposition, and it is neither mysterious
nor impossible.
DEMOCRATIC BULLDOZING.
The letter from Joseph Asbury John
son published in The Call yesterday
gives a forcible statement of the position
in which sincere and earnest Populists
find themselves at St. Louis. Mr. John
son, in addition to being a correspondent
of Tux Call, is one of the delegates to the
Populist convention from this State, and
is ont of the foremost leaders of tbe party
on this coast. A sincere believer in the
principles of his party and a stalwart sup
porter of its organization, he went to St.
Lonis earnestly desirous of bringing about
some form of union of all the silver forces
during tbe campaign. How be and his
friends have been received there can be
best stated in tbe following quotations
from his letter:
The only way in which I have heard or seen
Populists alluded to in this city is lv terms of
absolute contempt and the lowest form of
criminal slander by Bryanized Populists of
the Senator Allen type and silver bulldozers of
every typel â¢ â¢ â¢ It is a great strain on the
magnanimity of self-respec;ing Populists to
hold on patiently under contumely and
brazen effrontery grossly thrust upon them
in tbe newspapers and in all public places.
* * * I stood for an hour to hear Senator
Alien lay down the law to Populists and name
the penalties for failure to obey it. If we de
cline to rush at his bidding into tbe Bryan
camp it is proof that we have seen Mark Han
na's agents or are waiting to see them. I can
recall no occasion in my life when my soul
was assaulted, my manhood assailed, my con
victions outraged and my indignation so
wrathfully aroused ax while listening to
these unmanly, dishonorable and unprovoked
charges fall from the lips of a man whom
Populists have felt so proud to honor and who
was out a few days since their first choice for
the Presidency. This is not the way that leads
to union.
â¢ It will be seen from this statement that
the tactics of the Democratic tools at I St.
Louis are identical with those pursued by
the '.. bosses toward the I gold men ; at Chi
cago. Tillman and Altgeld are not present
at St. ; Louis, but the spirit of their domi
nation rules their followers who are there.
Not a single offer of conciliation is* made.
Every one who differs from the plan of the
bosses is denounced 'as a bribe-taker, a
boodler, a tool of corruption. As Russell,

ABOUT FREE TRADE.
Notwithstanding wreck and ruin Lad
followed in the wake ol the Democratic
tariff act of 1846. the convention of ISSG,
which nominated Buchanan, declared for
a still lower tariff, or, as the platform put
it, "free seas and progressive free trade
throughout the world." Mr. Buchanan
was elected and there immediately fol
lowed one of the worst roiumercial and
financial panics that ever visited this
country. It lasted four years and every
industry, business and financial establish
ment in the land suffered enormously. In
his last message, beiore giving way to Mr.
Lincoln, President Buchanan said: "With
unsurpassed plenty in ali the productions
and in all the elements of natural wealth,
our manufactuiers have suspended; our
public works are retarded; our private en
terprises of different kinds are abandoned
and thousands of useful laborers are
thrown out of employment and reduced to
want. We have possessed all the elements
of material wealth in rich abundance, and
yet, notwithstanding all these advantages,
our country, in Its monetary interests, is
in a deplorable condition."
In his last message to Congress Mr.
Buchanan had the honesty to admit that
not only bad the free-trade policy of the
Democratic party failed to provide suffi
cient revenue to maintain the Government
by over $77,000,000, bnt that it had left
"unutterable misery and ruin" in its
wake. The next object lesson in Demo
cratic free trade is now before the people.
Between the retirement of Buchanan and
the election of a Democratic President and
Congress, which came into power in 1893,
the country increased in population more
than 100 per cent and in material wealth
more than $50,000,000,000. Since the re
peal of the tariff act of 1890 the people
have had more than a taste of what the
Democratic party gave the country during
its administration from 1897 to 1861, but
what is called the "new Democracy" is
now before the country asking to be com
missioned to not only continue the old
party's tariff policy, but to give the people
an uncertain and most doubtful monetary
system. This is a nation of sovereigns,
and if they want the misery that was sent
upon them by Buchanan and Cleveland
poured out upon them In greater and in
more disastrous quantity let them shout
and vote for Bryan.
IT IS THE PEOPLE'S WAY.
The celebration of the founding of
Cleveland, Ohio, 100 years ago. brought
thousands of people to that city, and
although it was not intended that the
event should partake of a political char
acter in any sense, there was a demon
stration in honor of Major McKinley, who
was one of tbe speakers, that dwarfed tbe
real purpose of the gathering. After re
viewing the mighty strides of the city in
recent years more especially, and giving
due honor to tbe heroism of the first set
tiers of Northern Ohio, the regular meet
ing adjourned when there was a spontan
eous uprising of people of all parties to
show their appreciation of the splendid
character whom tbe Republican party had
chosen to lead the country out of the
chaotic condition into which it unfor
tunately had been inveigled by experi
mental economic theorists.
It cannot be said that tbe demonstration
would bave been timely under ordinary
circumstances, but when men rise up
freed from party allegiance and express
their satisfaction at seeing one in whom
they rely to give new and positive empha
sis to the importance of ever holding tbe
prosperity of Americans the paramount
duty, there need be no apology for show
ing forth their Americanism. In splendid
good taste Major McKinley made no refer
ence whatever to tbe political contest
which is now engaging the attention of
tbe people, but the very fact that he stood
there tbe representative of true patriotism,
complete protection to American interests
and deep-rooted prosperity for all the
people, it was natural that political affilia
tions should be fonzotton and that the
people should give expression of their
pleasure at seeing the man upon whom
they rely to bring back that ton*, charac
ter and independence to our institutions
which are their inheritance.
LANDLORD ALTGELD.
Whatever else may be said of Altgeld it
cannot be said that he is careless or indif
ferent in the management of his rast
estate. He Is reported to be worth $4,000,
-000, which is mostly invested in Chicago
improved real estate. Naturally, he has a
large rentroll, but there are people who
will be surprised when they are informed
that Mr. Altgeld confines his free-silver
coinage at 16 to 1 to the political side of
his life. The Unity block is one of the
most valuable office and store buildings in
Chicago. It is true that it is owned by a
company, but Altgeld is the president of
tbe company ana controls the majority of
the stock. There are many tenants, and
each one is required to sign a lease, so as
to make sure that he is bound to the build
ing company.
It now transpires that this great and
sincere advocate of silver coinage obliges
every tenant to obligate himself to pay his
rent "in standard gold of the United
States." Thus is the low cunning and
double character of the man exposed.
When playing upon the credulity of the
unthinking for personal political gain be
cries for free silver coinage and tells how
the "^oldbngs" are driving the poor into
still deeper poverty, and how their only
salvation lies in supporting himself and
his allies at the polls, but when it comes
to his private business affairs he is a
prince among "goldbugs," even to the
extent of requiring renters of his property
to pay their rent in gold. Well, Altgeld
is a representative man of the Bryan school
of bimetallists, and unless the people rise in
their might and overthrow Altgeld, Bryan
and the new Democracy, they will prove
themselves to be unworthy of the rights of
freemen.
It should be remembered that Cleveland
refused to make any attempt to establish
international bimetallism and ignored a
resolution of Congress calling for a con
ference of the nations on the subject, and
yet tbe men who elected Cleveland are
now posing as the friends of free silver
and denouncing those who propose to
establish it by international agreement.
The New York World figures out that on
a free-silver platform a Democratic candi
date can carry only 182 electoral votes,
and possibly only 120. Tbe showing is
not flattering, but it is probably better
than could be made by the candidate on
any other platform.
Bear in mind that tiie Republican party
is pledged to bimetallism, that McKinley
is a genuine bimetaliist, and you will un
derstand why all conservative silver men
will vote for him.
â¢ There will be <no dispute , over , the au
thorship of the Democratic platform. No-
JjQ^jr is proud of it or degixea (9 aim i^

THE THIRD TICKET.
New York Sun.
We take the mass of Democrats to be too in
telligent in their conceptions of Democratic
principles and too serious in their devotion to
tbe Institutions of the United States to sulk
when the country Is threatened by Democracy's
bitterest enemy, Populism. Refusing to vote
for McKinley, theomy effective enemy of the
Populists, and setting up a second Democratic
ticket would be like withdrawing fiom the
home army because of dixgatisXaction with the
general's epauiets, and goiug off separately for
drtss parade.
A third ticket might serve tbe personal com
fort of tbose whose hatred of McKinley is
hotter than their love for this country. It
would be an ally, directly or indirectly, of the
Populist ticket. Don't let any Democrat de
ceive himself on this point.
THE NEW FRESNO.
Fresno Republican.
The Valley Railroad is now but a few miles
out of Fresno, and it is expected that it will be
completed to the city limits within thÂ» ? next
three or four weeks. /Already the towns to the
north of the San Joaquin River are beginning
to feel the beneficial effects of competition and
reduced tariffs, and T ; Fresno's transportation
vassalage ;to the Southern Pacific Company
soon will be ended. The Valley road already
has made some important reductions in freight
charges :to < and -4 from the I towns { which \t
reaches, and its complete tariff-sheet will soon
be issued. It *is \ announced that its schedule
will make an average reduction of between 30
and 25 per Cent oh all classes of freight. Â£"?"â  f
}": It would be nearly impossible, and at any
rate there is no danger that anybody will over
estimate the benefit which the valley will re
ceive from genuine competition In. transporta
tion. It has been a long time now that the
all-the-tramc-will-bear principle has been ap
plied to the people down * this way, and; a*
there was no competition the traffic has borne
IB9OSa 10 tut dÂ«Â£tÂ« bftTt hÂ»a lAftli Â«bÂ«&ee tO
I decrease. Some instances of railroad extor
tion which might be cited, and many of which
heretofore have been cited, are so outrageous
as to almost Â»onnd like fiction.
It may reasonably be expected that the ad
vent of the Valley Railroad will put an end to
this kind of thing. Nothing could have been
hoped irom the Southern Pacific Company, for
its representatives had testified that a reduc
tion of 8 per cent in a single schedule meant
bankruptcy for it, and had they testified to
nothii% of thÂ« kind the company's rule* of
action were known to include no provision for
reducing rates where competition did not
i necessitate such action. The people had sÂ«t
-i tied down to a condition of helplessness,
, through which only occasionally flashed the
smoldering tires of indignation.
Rut now the change is at hand. Freight
tariffs will be reduced from one-fifth to one
fourth, and such a change will put the people
! of the San Joaquin Valley on something like a
j living basis with the rest oi the world. "The
good time coming, which is almost here, it
was long, long, long on the way." With the
; arrival of the Valley road a new era will dawn
for California's great cential domain.

MISS'S WAIST, SAILOR COLLAR.
Sailor collars which form revers in front are
a favorite shape. The waist shown above laps
at the waist line, and this, with the revers,
makes a fichu effect that is particularly styl
ish. The collar may be made separate or sewn
to the waist. Collars of black silk muslin,
trimmed with ruffles or pleatings of the same,
are worn with bright-colored silk waista for
evening.
This model is very well adapted for making
up washable materials. The brown home
spun linens and cottons which suggest dish
toweling are very fashionable, and serviceable
as well. One seen had a sailor collar of white
lawn of tbe sheerest kind. This was edged
with a ruffle of the same. The V was of white
piquet.
, A dress of brown hollands had collar of
batiste of the iamc shade, which was inter
sected by lines of green and rose color. The V
was of the plain goods, finished by a collar of
the batiste.
Plaid or fancy ginghams are pretty, with
collars of plain gingham, such as pink, with
a checked gingham in which there is a little
pink.
White lawn collars are also dainty on ging
hams and cambrics.
The waist is made with a yoke top which
forms the V. The lining is cut like the out
side, which is gathered at the waist line, back
and front. For the heavier wash goods no
lining is necessary.

within the ]urisdiction of this State, and be
made to support his family. If there were ,no
children, the wife would have to wait a year
before she could commence an action for di

band should run away with another man's

RECORD-BREAKING
MAIL STEAMERS,
The City of Sydney Two
Days Ahead of Sched
ule Time.
SO WAS THE COLOMBIA.
Fastest Trip on Record From
Honolulu Made by the
Steamer China.
RUMORS ABOUT THE SAN JUAN
Another Overdue Ship on Which
Reinsurance Was Paid Has
Reached Port
The Pacific Mail Company's steamers
are all making time nowadays. New in
structions have been issued, and in conse
quence the China and Panama steamers
he Paclflo Mall Company's Steamer City of Sydney, Captain Frank Johnston,
Which Made the Snn From Panama Two Days Quicker Than Schedule Timel
are all coming in ahead of schedule. The
Colombia was two days ahead when she
ran on tie rocks at Pigeon Point. The
China beat the record between Yokohama
and San Francisco, making the final run
from Honolulu in two hours' better time
than her own record. The City of Sydney
arrived from Panama two days ahead, and
Captain Johnston says that bis vessel was
not pushed.
The Sydney is one of the handsomest
steamers that comes into port She has
been a lucky vessel for the Mail Company,
as few if any accidents have happened on
her, and she has always more than paid
expenses. -
Captain Frank Johnston, commander of
t;i c Sydney, is one of the ablest masters
on the Pacific and is a universal favorite.
He was master . of the City of New York
when she went on the rocks at Point
Bonita, but at the inquiry held by In
spectors of Hulls and < Boilers it was
shown that the pilot who was in charge
insisted upon holding his course in spite
of the protests of the master. When the
vessel struck Johnston felt like throwing
the pilot overboard. / > v .
There was a rumor current on the water
front yesterday to the effect that the Mail
Company's San Juan had gone ashore in
the ion near Manzunillo. It was near this
port that the Colima . capsized ; and went
down. The telegraphic communication is
very poor and on the occasion of the Co
lima disaster it was five days before . the
news reached San Francisco. The Mail
Company has received no advices, but then
they got the first news of the loss of the
Colima from the newspapers. . .
The San Juan left Panama five days
after the City of Sydney; and would there
fore be in the vicinity .< of Manzanillo last
Tuesday. The Mail Company's officials
put no faith in the story, however, and
say, that had the vessel gone ashore they
would have heard of it. v r;f = .'.-,.
The steamer Mariposa sailed for Sydney,
N. 8. W.,' via Honolulu, Apia : and "â¢ Auck
land, last night. The English mail was
late, and in consequence the vessel was de
layed until 11 p. m. Among the vessel's
cargo is over a thousand bicycles and
large consignments of onions and flour.
The former are a drug in this market, but
are a luxury at the Antipodes at this time.
The schooner Annie has been chartered
by the North American Commercial Com
pany and will load provisions and general
merchandise for Alaska :at Steuart-street
wharf. The Annie has ' been in Oakland
Creek for quite a long time, but to-day she I
will come i from her retirement, > and â  after
being overhauled and loaded will start for
the Alaskan mining camps. .
Another overdue ship reached port last
Wednesday. It was the British ship Bed
fordshire, on which 12 per cent reinsurance
was paid. The Bedfordshire : : was from
Astoria for Liverpool, and reached Queens
town in company with- the German ship
Arthur Fitger. The latter was from San
Francisco, and made the run-in 101 days.
This is far and away ; the best passage
made this season. Â.,' Â°
The magnificent battle-ship Oregon will
be open for inspection next Sunday.- This
is the first time that the man-of-war has
been thrown open to the public, so there
is bound to be a rush to see her. Henry
Peterson will run the launch Amy from
i^olsom-street wharf, and other steamers
will make excursions to the big ship. > â¢ -, \
: :â¢" The Harbor Commissioners iield a short
session yesterday. The ", monthly : ; bills
were passed* and a few matters of minor,
importance were attended to. _ ......
; The brig John D. Spreckels arrived from
Hawaii . yesterday with a load 'of sugar,
and weal direct \to the â¢ refinery.'; Captain
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1896.
Christiansen reports light and baffling
winds during the entire trip, bo it is no
wonder that the brig took twenty-five days
to make the ran. The Spreckels holds the
record, having come from Kabului to San
Francisco in a little over ten days.
San Francisco will be well supplied with
tramp steamers in a few weeks. One is
now loading at Port Costa and two more
are on the way from Yokohama the
Agordat, 1728 tons, from Santos; LonÂ»
ships, 2843 tons, from Singapore, and the
Cedar Branch, 1542 tons, from Yokohama.
All six vessels will load wheat, and in con
sequence the vessels at 3aui>alito will re
main idle for some time to come.
John and Caesar Cummings, the River
aide murderers, and Charles Marshall, the
San Jacinto murderer, were taken across
the bay on the steamer Tiburon yesterday.
Tbe two brothers are to be hanged at San
Quentin on September 25, while Marshall
has to serve sixty years at hard labor.
The Cummings' murdered a farmer named
Murramer on the Riverside ranch, and
Marshall killed Frank Hamilton in April,
1894. He was convicted, but secured a
new trial on a technicality, and was found
guilty of murder in the second degree.
THE CITY'S ASSESSMENT.
Clerks In the Auditor's Department
at Work Figuring Up the Totals
in the Books.
Auditor Broderick has a big force of
clerks at work footing up the Assessor's
books since they were sent down to him
by the Board of Equalization after the
many changes made had been entered.
Within a short time the amount of tax
able property in the City will be known,
and the Board of Supervisors will be able
to figure, after hearing the various depart
ments on the subject of the appropriations
they will expect, the amount ot the tax
levy for the next year.
Though no accurate figures are obtain
i able at the present time it is known to the
board that the aggregate reduction wil
not reach 54,000,000 and that in conse"
quence the tax levy is in no great danger
of being placed at a high figure or of the
State board making a general raise. Out
side of a few of the big corporations and
a limited number of property-owners who
appealed the reductions amounted to
practically nothing.
MRS. LANG'S CHILDREN,
Two Token From Her Because of Her
Alleged Indulgence in Intoxicants.
Frank J. Kane of the Society for the
Suppression of Vice was yesterday
appointed as guardian of two infant
children of Mrs. Bessie Lang of 917
Greenwich street. Kane is already the
guardian of her 10-year-old son, having
been so appointed several months ago.
It is alleged that Mrs. Lang is habitually
intemperate and therefore not a fit person
to have charge of her babies. She is suing
her husband, Charles Lang, who formerly
conducted a cigar-stand at 328 Pine street,
for divorce, and she says that a few weeks
ago he deserted her and is now on his way
East. She recently received a letter from
him dated at Ogden, Utah, in which he
stated she would never see him again.
There was quite a miscellaneous lot of
swearine in Judge Coffey's court during
the bearinjE of Kane's application for let
ters of guardianship. Mrs. Lang does not
seem to have got along amicably with
some of her neighbors, and more than one
of them swore that she neglected her off
spring and devoted herself to the bottle.
One woman declared she watched an in
fant Lang roll in tbe dirt in the rear yard
of the parental domicile for four hours,
meanwhile chewing vigorously on the un
nutritious rubber stopper of a milk bottle.
This amiable argus said in all seriousness
that she never once during that four hours
took her eyes off the wallowing babe.
Other neighbors corroborated this testi
mony, but Mrs. Lang denied that she
drank to excess, which statement was also
made by her ten-year-old son. She ac
knowledged occasionally taking a glass of
beer, but said one glass was her limit.
Judge Coffey interposed, saying:
' 'There has never been a woman in this
court who acknowledged to more than one
glass. They probably fill and empty that
one many times."
Mrs. Lang made quite a scene in the cor
ridor outside the courtroom when she was
separated from her boy and declared she
would work faithfully and sell her furni
ture if necessary, to support her offspring
if tbe court would only allow her to keep
them.

DEMANDS MADE
FOR CITY FUNDS,

the Board of
Health.
NEEDS OF THE SCHOOLS.
Improvement Clubs Want More
School Buildings
Erected.
FINANCES ARE DISCUSSED.
Hearing Given A so to the Represen
tatives of the Merchan s'
Association.
Tte Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met last evening to hear from
improvement clubs, the Board of Health,
Board of Education, the Merchants' As
sociation or any other body that might
wish to be heard.
Dr. Clinton of the Board of Education
said ttiat he came to second the movement
of the people of the Mission to secure
high school facilities for the Mission,
which section represents one-third of the
wealth and one-third of the school chil
dren of the City. He considered that the
Mission has a right to ask for this.
Ex-Tax Collector Grady, the present
president of the Mission High School
Club, appeared to advocate a high school
for the Mission. Mr. Grady told how
other sections have high schools, while
the Mission has none. There are in the
district south of O'Farrell street certainly
enough children to fill a high school. He
was aware that there is a cry for economy
this year, but he believes that there are
other ways of cutting down expenses. He
thought that the funds asked for in the
interests of the Golden Gate Park can be
cut down. There are police enough for
tbe present and there is no necessity
for an immediate increase.
J. F. Crossett, chairman of the executive
committee of the Mission Hieh School
Club, seconded the remarks of Mr. Grady.
He believed that the people of the Mission
are entitled to a hign school not only as
taxpayers but also as heads of families.
Young men annoy the ycung girls going
from a distance to attend the high school
in the Western Addition. They are an
noyed on the cars and on the streets. Mr.
Crossett cited the Durrant case as an in
stance. There are 50,000 young people in
the area which is represented in tue re
quest for a high school. This portion of
the City paya a great share of taxes, but is
deprived of facilities which other section?
have. The request was made for an ap
propriation oi $200,000 to provide a lot
and school. "We will keep at this until
we get it," said Mr. Crossett in conclusion.
A. P. Van Duzer spoke also in favor of
the proposed hieh school. He believed
the taxpayers would stand a tax rate of
$1 75 this year, or even 2 per cent. Last
year the rate was $2 25. This year the
State tax levy will be 8 or 10 cents less
than it was last year. He asked that
the Mission be credited with the $200,000
now in the treasury. He believed that
tbe amount cannot be legally claimed by
the associated creditors. He figured out
that the expenses this year of the City and
County will be $550,000 less than last year
if the Supervisors will cut down the park
appropriation and other acts which he
considered advisable. Incidentally he
said that the cost of providing janitors for
the City Hall could be lessened. The
Mission people object to tde heavy ex
pense incurred in carfares sending their
children out to Scott street. A . igh
school in the Mission would be a monu
ment to tbe Finance Committee.
Chairman Taylor said that if there was
nothing to add of importance the com
mittee would take the matter under con
sideration.
Judge Van Reynegom said that the Mis
sion is losing citizens who are going else
where to get school facilities. If the board
cannot cut down somewhere to provide for
the high school he would ask that an ad
ditional tax snail be made. He also said,
in response to a question by Chairman
Taylor, that be had no suggestion as to
where a cut can be made. He did not be
liev- that the $200,000 in the tr< asury can
be legally appropriated to the associated
creditors.
School Director Knox said that the Pre
sidio Improvement Club was here in ref
erence to the school facilities in that sec
tion.
B. Sbarboro spoke invfavor of providing
a better school and said that the children
in the Presidio are now attending school
in a mere box, which is a temporary
structure.
Ex-School Director Woodward described
the Presidio school as inadequate and
spoice of the rapid growth of the district.
Henry H. Hart of the Board of Health
presented tbe wishes of the board. He
mentioned among the needs of the board
the following: One veterinary surgeon,
one chemist, one assistant chemist, eight
food and milk inspectors, three sewer and
three sanitary inspectors, two bakery and
bath inspectors, a typewriter and a janitor.
There are other desires.
One of these is a permanent investment
for horae and ambulance; another is the
permanent establishment of a chemical
and bacteriological laboratory. The board,
in brief, asks for $40,643 in addition to
what it already has. Last year the de
partment had $49,700, including the quar
antine department.
School Director Murdock submitted the
wishes of the School Board, and said that
the board expects to get what it asks for,
because only toe actual needs of the de
partment have been considered. The
total amount is $1,565,212.
This includes permanent improvements,
these being the school buildings proposed,
which have been already mentioned. The
total salary list amounts to $^62,000, of
which $895,000 is for the teachers. Mr.
Murdock saw' that the salaries are reason
able, and that the bids for supplies are
low. The amount of $1,015,000 is needed
without counting anything for repairs.
High schools are needed, but primary
schools are also needed. The sanitary
condition of some schools is very poor.
One new schoolbouse should be built
every year from the rent of the Lincoln
school property. The item of general re
pairs is placed at $64,000. "The board,"
Mr. Murdock said, "would, under the es
timates made, be $70.000 worse off than
lasi year." Tbe actual .ieeds of the depart
ment, if no new schools are built, will be
$1,^00,000.
Chairman Taylor asked some questions
and incidentally remarked that alter a
period of ten years the school expense has
increased 20 cents per capita.
Mr. Murdock said that he personally felt
that this is not a good year to make per
manent improvements, but enough should
be given to permit keeping buildings in
repair. The lowest the board could get
alone with ia $1,100,000 and the rents,
which amount to nbout $48,000.
Superintendent Babcock of the School
Department said that the depart men. can
not get along with less than $1,200,000 for
the year. He also made a general state
ment concerning the schools and a general
discussion occurred in which all the mem
bers of the committee and School Director
Knox t ok part.
Daniel Sullivan, president of the Bernal
Heights Improvement Club, spoke in fa
vor of an appropriation for Bernal Park.
It would cost between $8000 and $10,000 to
complete the park, and Mr. Sullivan
thought that the iniDrovement is needed.
Joseph Ellis asked for an appropriation
of $7000 for tbe improvement of Yerba
Buena Park.
M. S. Kohlberg, vice-president of the
Merchants' Association, spoke briefly.
He asked for $10,000 for sprinkling the
business streets. He said that one-fourth
of the sum is now paid for sprinkling Van
Ness avenue. The Merchants' Association
pledges itself to sprinkle Van Ness avenue
and all other business streets if $10,000 is
granted. If the appropriation is not
enough the association will make up the
deficit. It costs the merchants a large
sum for sprinkling business streets which
they ought not properly to pay.
The association in asking for the sprink
ling appropriation did not wish to em
barrass oiber funds. The various funds
were discussed by Mr. Kohlberg and the
committee. Mr. Kohlberg spoke of the
park appropriation. He said that he had
information that the Park Commissioners
would be satisfied with $250,000. He
thought that the way to provide for
schoolhouses was by bonding the City.
The Merchants' Association delegation
consisted of Mr. Kohlberg, W. S. Doane
and Secretary Freud. The delegation filed
a report with the committee with sugges
tions. The substnnre has been previously
published. Mr. Kohlberg said that the
Merchants' Association favors economy,
but at the same time wants the heads of
the City departments to have enough
money to carry on their work,. At tlie
same time he repeated that if ever there is
a time for retrenchment this is the time.
The association wishes to call attention to
the fact that the City is charged a higher
rate for lights than private parties are
charged. The association sees no reason
for that.
N. C. Weinholz appeared with a delega
tion for improvements at Hoily Park.
Herbert E. Law appeared for the Van
Ness Improvement Club in favor of mak
ing Lombard street a boulevard west of
Van Ness avenue. The cost would be only
$1250. He also wanted Van Ness avenue
bituminized from Pine street to Hayes.
The authorities at Fort Mason have agreed
to terrace down the bank on the east side
of the grounds which abuts on the avenue
and to make it attractive as a public park.
D. T. Russell asked for the setting aside
of $2000 for muking a survey and setting
monuments in the section bounded by Ot
tawa avenue, Mission street, Regent street
and San Jose avenue.
8. P. Nolan of the Fourth-street Im
provement Club headed a delegation ask
ing for the repairing of the Fourth-street
pavement, which has been put in bad con
dition by the raising of railroad tracks to
the grade. The street is below grade.
Peter T. Seculovich appeared in favor
of tbe acquisition of a piece of land at the
junction of Mission and Valencia streets
for ft park.
The committee adjourned until this
afternoon.
PREPARING FOR ACTION.
Official Conduct of Seven Super
visors Is to Be Investi
gated.
Taxpayers Are Willing to Support
the Grand Jury With
Money.
It is asserted that the postponement of
the Grand Jury meeting until next Mon
day at 2p. M. does not signify that the
members of the jury are idle or indifferent.
Inquiry made yesterday disclosed the fact
that important preparations nave been
made for the next session.
When the committee from the Grand
Jury submitted a statement of the assess
ment case to District Attorney Barnes and
sought bis advice he decided to recall
from vacation one of his ablest assistants.
It is well known that money has been
tendered by interested taxpayers to em
ploy additional counsel if the District
Attorney should require more assistance.
The seven Supervisors who voted to re
duce the personal property assessments of
the Spring Valley Water Works, the Mar
ket-street Railway Company and the San
Francisco Gaslight Company do not say
very much. 'They are awaiting with some
degree of aoprehens.on to ascertain what
line of investigation will be developed by
the Grand Jury.
The members of the Grand Jury must
have some positive information on the
suoject, but details of tbe knowledge pos
sessed by the jury are carefully concealed.
The Grand Jury was invited to meet the
Supervisors last nigtit and consider esti
mates for maintaining the local govern
ment during the fiscal year ending June
30 next.
This invitation was not accepted. The
jury has resolved to conhne its future
action to an investigation of the assess
ment case. No other business will be
taKen up.
It is certain that the Grand Jury will
not lack means to employ attorneys, ex
perts and detectives in case money should
be required in the search for proof tiiat
improper influences were used to Induce
certain Supervisors lo favor the corpora
tions.
A well-known citizen who served on the
Wallace Grand Jury has offered to con
tribute money himeelf and to raise a con
sideaable sum to defray expenses of the
investigation- The Grand Jury has re
ceived many assurances of support from
leading taxpayers of the City. The opin
ion is expressed that the Supervisors
should be brought into court to state under
oath what induced them to reject the lig
ures of the Asbes&or and the Grand Jury,
and then, without any data to guide them,
reduce tbe personal property assessments
of the corporations.
A FRUITLESS CLAIM.
F. O. Downing, Being Once Nonsuited,
Fares No Better on Appeal to
the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the
decision of the lower tribunal in the case
of F. O. Downing against M. W. Murray
and others. The plaintiff and Defendants
Murray, Treadwell, Fuller and Carroll
were joint owners of the Bears Nest,
Douglas Island and other mining proper
ties in Alaska. He had a separate oue
fifth interest in the two mines named, but
there was no evidence of separate owner
ship on his cart in the other properties.
In the latter part of 1891 the Bears Nest
mine and certain other mining properties
were sold, the cash received for them being
$650,000. Downing received $35,374 as his
share and gave a receipt in full settlement
of his claims. Three months iater, the
entire business being tnought to be con
cluded, he rescinded his final settlement
and demanded a fifth of all ths money re
ceived for all the mines. He was non
suited in the first action at law and fared
no better on appeal.

TWO MEN WHO
KNEW TOO MUCH,
Hurried Out of England to
Avoid an Official
Inquiry.
WERE IN KRUGER'S CITY
Attacked the Boers and Now
Making for Australia
to Hide.
LEFT HEEE LATE LAST NIGHT.
Captain Paterson and Thomas Grahame
Advised by British Authori
ties to Flee.
When tbe Mariposa left this port late
last night she had among her passengers
two political refugees from England, who
were ringleaders in the Johannesburg
outbreak, and who left Paris three
week 3 ago at the instance of the Brit
ish Government to make themselves
inaccessible as valuable witnesses for an
official inquiry into tbe origin of the up
rising in South Africa.
The men are now on their way to Aus
tralia. One is Captain W. S. Paterson of
Stirling, Scotland, who is bound for Syd
ney. The ot! er is Thomas W. R. Gra
hame, an Englishman, upon whose fash
ionably engraved calling card appears the
address, "269 West One Hundred and
Eighteenth street,. New York city"; his
destination is Brisbane.
They arrived here Tuesday night di
rectly from New York and took rooms at
the Lick, according to arrangements made
by Grahame's younger brother, who
reached bore several days previously, but
who did not himself stay at the hotel until
Wednesday night.
That last night was an unfortunate ex
perience for the captain. He got out
alone and attempted quietly to lose his
identity while exploring the "cocktail
route" and the mysteries of the Bar
bary Coast. He succeeded in losing his
identity. He lost bis way. He lost his
personal liberty. And he lost $80.
But these are all trivial facts gathered
from his remarks yesterday afternoon as
he sat on the edge of his bed sucking
mechanically at an extinguished cigarette
and occasionally passing his fingers
through Itia disheveled locks to take the
temperature of his feverish head.
"We were sent away just as fast as ever
we could go," be explained. "Mr. Cham
berlain advised us lo light out.
"The way of it was I had brought the
Arawa from Sydney to Durban. The
Arawa is a 5500- ton steamer. Was an ex
periment of the company's coming
straight across from Australia. Won't do
it again. They lost Â£10,000. Never got
any freight. Put in at the Cape and eot
butter â just some cases of butter. All had
on trip up on way home was 1700 pounds
beef.
"Well, when I was at Durban I got
orders from Sir Frederick Carrinpton â
What do you want to know how all these
names are spelled for? He was down at
the Caps at the time. So I organized a
cavalry company â twenty-five in the com
pany â and started for Johannesburg. I
was one of the police, you know, captain
of tne police. I was told to get ready to
go to Johannesburg, and we went. Tom
was a trooper with me. Tom ? Tom Gra
hame, of course. Where is he now? I'll
be blamed if I know. Ain't he here?"
And then the captain got up and hesi
tatingly peered round the' room and over
the foot of the bed in search uf his com
rade.
"I nerer tried to boss my men when I
took command. I just treated them like
companions. I said to them, 'Boys, we
got to start d quicK,' and in ten
minutes we were in the saddle. And when

we fonnd the Boers too strong for us and
Dr. Jameson rode in front of us and told
us to stop firing, and we did stop firing.
Was there fighting? Fignting nothing.
We fired seventeen shots. Boers fired
about seven. Then Dr. Jameson comes out
and says, 'Give up, boys,' and that's all
there was to it.
"Was there a crowd of Eoers? Well,

Johannesburg would have been British

"We got out of South Africa about three

"What am I going to do in Australia?

Captain Paterson is a man built much
on the plan of Sharfcey, the pugilist. He
is about the sarxie height and perhaps a
little lighter in weight. His hair and heavy
mustache are already muc<> streaked witti
gray. His companion, Grahame, is a typi
cal Englishman, perhaps 40 years of age,
small of stature and slight of build.

TROLLEY WIRES IN
SONOMA VALLEY.
Plan of Some Enterprising
English Capi
talists
TO REACH TIDEWATER.
Electric Freight Cars for the
Wares of the Farmer and
the Fruit Man.
PROSPECTS OF LOW RATES.
Franchises Will Soon Be Asked For
and Work Will Commence
Without Delay.
It has lone been a source of surprise to
practical Eastern visitors to this coast that
Californian? fail to employ their magnili
cant waterways to their obvious profit.
There is no 6tate in the Union with better
facilities lor water transportation. The
bay of San Francisco is like the center of a
star, with navigable streams radiating in
many directions. Some of these streams,
it is true, have been partially used for
freight transportation since the days of
the earliest settlers, but none of them
have yet been employed to their full ca
pacity.
Intelligent business men have long
point6d out the great saving to the
farmer and fruit-grower possible in the
navigation of the bay creeks and great in
land rivers. They have pointed out that
the Sacramento, with a little assistance
from the Government, could be made
navigable to good-sized craft from Red
Bluff to San Francisco, and that the south
central streams are equally available.
Were these streams employed to their full
capacity the saving to farmers would be
immense, and many an agriculturist
n<>w practically bankrupt would to-day be
prosperous had he been able to use the
waterways to his market so liberally pro
vided by nature.
Heretofore only the farmers living on
the shores of tidewater streams adjacent
to fran Francisco liave reaped the ad
vantages of these creeks, inlets and rivers.
But there are indications that a new era is
about to dawn and that farmers compara
tively remote will be enabled to enjoy the
cheap transportation extended by them.
Unfortunately, however, it is English not
local capital that will do the exploita
tion; and yet there are millions of unem
ployed capital in the banks of California.
Thus the spectacle is presented of foreign
capital coming in and making money un
der tne very noses of local moneyed men
while they have been "waiting for some
thing to turn up."
Old Sonoma, the first established town
in the State, is to be the scene of the open
ine of this new era. The selection is thus
quite proper, and history bids fair to re
peat itself.
There is considerable excitement over
the matter up in the Sonoma Valley, for
it means a good deal to the farmers and
orchardists of that beautiful vale. If it
proves successful, it means the emancipa
tion of thousands of farmers from exces
sive freight charges. Not only this, it
means that other sections will go and do
likewise, and thus in due time vast dis
tricts of California will be permanently
benefited.
The project is this: The Kenwood Land
Company, which owns a large tract of
land between Glen Ellen and Santa Rosa,
is about to construct an electric railroad
from Santa Rosa to Sonoma, a distance of
twenty miles. This will bring the farmers
and orchardists of the upper Sonoma
Valley within six miles of the embarca
dero on Sonoma Creek, where a schooner
making regular trips between San Fran
cisco and tbe Sonoma Valley has a land
in:'. This of course means the release of
those farmers and orchardists from possi
ble high rail rates in the future. It is one
of the finest sections of the State.
Around Glen Ellen there are famous
olive orchards, vineyards and wineries, for
Sonoma is celebrated for its wines. Fur
thur on toward Santa Rosa, just over the
hills, are the great prune orchards of So
r.oma County, second only to those of the
Santa Clara Valley. The electric line will
enable all these prune, olive and wine men
to land their products by electric line and
water at San Francisco at much less' than
they pay now. When the line gets well in
operation it is proposed to extend it from
Ponoma down to navigable tidewater at
the embarcadero, thus obviating the
necessity of a six-mile wagon haul and the
consequent breakage of bulk at Sonoma.
Between Sonoma and the embarcadero
are large orchards and vineyards, and it is
j-roposed to put in sidetracks at the prin
cipal orchards to allow the orchardists to
load their fruit on the cars at their leisure,
thus giving the electric company an op
portunity for rapid and practically un
broken transit to tidewater.
Of course, the project will be opposed by
the railroads. There are two lines in the
valleyâ the Southern Pacific and tne San
Francisco and North Tacific. The former
line is a branch running from Napa Junc
tion to Santa Kosa, called the Santa Rosa
and Carquinez Straits line. The latter
leaves the main stem of the San Francisco
and North Pacific at Ignacio, in Marin
Connty, runs due east across Petaluma
Creek, turns north into the Sonoma Val
ley, and terminates at Glen Ellen at the
extreme upper end of the valley, passing
through Sonoma Town. Rail rates are
cheap in the valley, owine to the compe
tition between the Southern Pacific and
its lively rival, and, as if this were not
enough, the schooner line from Sau Fran
cisco up San Pablo Bay and Sonoma Creek
to the embarcadero prevents the two lines
from pooling to the loss of the farmers and
the orchardists. Freight rates in the So
noma ValJey are thus the cheapest in the
State to-day, but when the new electric
line gets into operation they will be
cheaper still. And if there is anything
the California farmer needs it is cheap
freight rates.
It goes without saying that these two
railroads will fight the new line. They
will prevent it from obtaining a franchise
from Sonoma County if they can. The
]>eople of the valley have been quick to
realize this, and will watch their Board of
Supervisors very closely when the fran
chise comes up before it for approval.
The plan of organization is unique, but
simple and very intelligent. Between
$260,000 and $300,000 worth of bonds will
be issued, but the English capitalists wish
to insure the interest on them for at least
two years. To secure it, therefore, they
will issue ticket-books, each good for 1000
miles of travel at 1 cent a mile, or $10 for
the book, and the sale of these among the
farmers will easily insure a good interest
on the bond is9ue. These tickets will be
transferable, and the holder and all his
family and a carload of his friends can all
travel on the one book. The franchise
will be asked for in a short time, and tbe
promoters hope to get to work within
sixty days.
MURDERER OCK WAH.
Held Besponslble for the Death of
Lee Tye by a Coroner's
Jury.
An inquest Into the death of Lee Tye,
who was killed Sunday night in Waverly
place, was held by Coroner Hawkins yes
terday. Ock Wah, alias Wong Ah Chuck,
was identified and charged with the mur
der.
Lee Kong, Lee Tung and Lee Ah Sing
testified to seeing the shot fired by the
accused man. On belrg asked if they
knew the murderer, they said, "That
man," pointing to Ock Wah. Officer Has
kell testified to making the arrest smd
having the murderer identified by one Ye
Tout. The jury retired and, after a few
moments' deliberation, returned a verdict
in accordance with the above facts.
Four other inquests were held in addi
tion to the one on the body of Lee Tye. In
the case of Charles Brown, who fell from
a porch on Minna street, the jury decided
that the death was accidental. A verdict
of suicide was rendered in the cases of
Holha W. Cox, Camilla Ferrari and John
W. Newell-Burns.
MONEY THAT COMES NOT
Appropriation for Sugar Manu
facturers Held at Wash
ington.
James Coffin Points Oat Discrimina
tionâTreasury Officials Said
to Be Culpable.
James Coffin, secretary of the Alameda
Sugar Company, paid a visit to the In
ternal Revenue Collector's office the other
day for information regarding the delay
in cayment of sugar bounties. In the
course of his investigations he made some
interesting discoveries in connection with
tbe way business is done in Washington.
It was proved by statistics that while
the Government was not paying the
bounty on sugar to American manufac
turers it has been giving brandy for forti
fication of sweet wines made in tbe United
States. The output of sweet wines in
California during the last season, accord
ing to internal levenue reports, increased
over 750,000 gallons. The total product of
sweet wines in California in the past
fiscal year was 4,233,116.44 gallons. In the
manufacture of this wine 1,027,909.8 gal
lons ol brandy were consumed. No tax
had to be paid on this brandy. As the tax
on brandy is $1 10 ti rallon, it may be seen
that the Government contributed toward
the wine industry of California |1, 130, 700 78
in the year.
Meanwhile the Government is slow in
paying the sugar bounty.
*'It sbdws the pull of the liquor inter
ests," said Mr. Coffin yesterday. "We
have 217 farmers on our list who supply
our little mill alone, and they employ
each from five to twenty men. The
amount of work we give is wonderful, but
wÂ« are neglected by the Government.
"Congress contracted to pay the sugar
manufacturers a bounty for fifteen years.
In 18iM this bounty was" taken off and a
duty of 40 per cent ad valorem substi
tuted. An appropriation was made which
was supposed to equalize matter?, but it
did not. And that money can't be got
because the Comptroller of the TreaÂ«ury
said that the appropriation was not con
stitutional.
"The Supreme Court of the United States
decided in favor of the sugar men to the
effect that Congress had the power to
make the appropriation, and that this
money should be paid. About a seventh
or eighth of it was paid in June. A Bmall
portion of it came to California.
"It would seem to me that they are do
ing everything in their power in Wash
ington to delay payment of the money.
For instance we received a telegram last
week from Washington, 'claims lost, send
duplicates.' We had duplicates in there
already, and I cannot see how they could
be lost in a Government office by acci
dent."

HER AGE NO SHIELD.
The Mother of Eight Children Brutally
Beaten by a Man of Thirty-
One Tears.
A woman giving her name as Mrs. Wil
son, aged about 45 years, is lying at tbe
home of a charitable lady friend at 1 Polk
street, striving to recover from a dreadful
mauling given her by Jack Condon of
soda-water fame.
Mrs. Wilson is the mother of eight chil
dren, the eldest of whom is a young man
more than old enough to vote. For some
time past she has resided with Condon,
w hoiÂ« 31 years old, at the house of a col
ored m agnetic healer known as "Mingo,"
on Mission street, near fifth. Her union
with Condon was cemented about eight
months ago by the birth of a little girl.
The tiny stranger's advent does not seem
to have brought harmony to tbe queerly
assorted pair, who have been fighting ever
since she came to town.
Last Monday nijjht things reached a
climax. Mrs. Wilson came out of the fray
with a battered nose, closed eyes, an ear
mashed or chewed beyond recognition and
a fare colored black and blue from the
swollen lips upward.
"I never saw a woman in so frightful a
state," commented Officer Frank Hoi
brook yesterday at the office of the Bociety
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
"Of course the woman is not in danger of
death, but what remains of pood looks she
may have had are surely gone beyond re
call. We are trying to find a place for the
little child, but Mount Bt. Joseph's is full
and there seems to be no other institution
for the reception of infants."
WATERMELONS SEIZED.
More Fruit From Fresno Consigned to
the Tide by Inspector
Billy Jordan.
Market Inspector Billy Jordan made an
other raid ou unripe watermrlons yester
day and as a result 300 were dumped into
the tide to feed the sharks or to be fished
out by the wharfrat and devoured with
many whoops of delight.
Half of the total number seized were
taken from a Davis-street commission
house, to which they had been consigned
by J. C. Azhderian of Fresno, while the
rest were sent in by Hobbs <fe Parson of
the same locality, and some of the melons
were sunburned and dangerous for food.
Green Frnit for London.
Another train load of green fruit left Sacra
mento Wednesday for London. It was the
third this season, and consisted of five cars of
mixed fruits. It will go through to Chicago,
over the Central Pacific, the Union Pacific and
tne Chicago ana Northwestern in ]20 hours
and thence to New York over ttie Erie Despatch
line in two days. Here the fruit will be trans
ferred to one of the steamer* of the American
Steamship line and arrive ln London two

AN ELOQUENT SPEAKER.

ing part in the single-tax campaign now
being carried on in Delaware, will soon be
Dr. R. S. Law, a Prominent Single-Taxcr, Who Is Soon to Arrive in This City.
in this City, where he will take part in
the campaign that is to be carried on in
favor of the constitutional amendment
granting local option in taxation.
The doctor is at present in Montana,
looking after some of his numerous min
ing interests, which he has scattered over
the country. He has also several large
mining interests in Placer and El Dorado
counties, in this State.
Dr. Law and his partner have a central
office in New YorK. The doctor is con
tinually running back and forth between
the metropolis and Delaware, where he
has been busy in the single-tax campaign
ever since its beginning about a year ago.
He travels through the State, talking to
the farmers, speaking in churches, and
when in the towns and cities speaking
nieht after night on the street corners.
Dr. Law lias furnished a tent for the
campaign which is used in various parts
of Delaware for campaign meetinzs.
Among the speakers who travel with it is
Robert M. Mobius, the brilliant young
Oakland speaker who left for the East
some months ago.
Whe/i the single-tax campaign was in
augurated in Delaware a year ago last
June Dr. Law was one af the most promi
nent of the score of Philadelphians who
began the fight for tax reform. At the
opening meeting the doctor prophesied
that before the campaign was over some
ten or a dozen prominent speakers whom
he named would come to speak in Dela
ware. Strange to say, without one excep
tion, all the speakers mentioned have
since entered the fight.
"Dr. Law is one of the most inde
fatigable workers in Delaware," said
Ralph E. Hoyt, who has just returned
from Delaware, whore he and the doctor
have been traveling about together carry
ing on the campaicn. "His geniality
and indefatigable zeal gain him admis
sion everywhere, and he seizes eagerly
every opportunity to preach the great re
form of which he is such an earnest advo
cate. "'
FOR JAPANESE CRUISERS,
The Union Iron Works and the
Cramps Have Submitted
Their Bids.
It Was the Splendid Showing of the
Oregon To at Caught the Japs'
Attention.
The builders of the Charleston, San Fran
cisco, Monterey, Olympia and Oregon may j
next be riveting together a fighter for the l
Mikado.
Yesterday a Washington dispatch stated
that American shipbuilders had been per- '
mined to compete for the construction of I
vessels for tbe Japanese navy, and that an
imperial board had just orened the bids at
the Japanese Legation. These bids had
been submitted by the Union Iron Works
and the Cramps for two fast cruisers. Their j
dimensions will be as follows:
Displacement, 47o0 tons; length, 37o feet;
beam, 48 feet ; draft, 17 feet 6 inches; horse
power, 15,000; speed under forced draft, j
22}^ knots; speed under natural draft, 20 U I
knots.
They are to be of the Yoshino type, a
15,000-ton cruiser built for the Japanese
Government in 1892. She has an arma
ment of four 6-inch and eight 4 7-10 inch
quick-fire rifles and twenty-two three
ponnder quick-firine rifles. Her coal
bunker capacity is ICOO tons and her speed
is 23.03 knots &n hour.
The two vessels will be furnished with
the very latest warlike appliances, it being
the desire of the Japanese Government to
secure for them the newest improvemen is.
Some time ago several Japanese officers
visited the Union Iron Works and care
fully inspected the plant The battle-ship
Oregon was noted as a sample of the out
put of that splendid ship factory.
The reports of the visiting officials were
favorable and the Union Iron Works was
invited to bid for iheouildineof the cruis
ers. Cramps were also asked to do the
same, and again the two great firms are
competing for the award.
'At the request of the Japanese Gov
ernment we put in bids for the construc
tion of the two cruisers," said Henry
Scott yesterday. "Of course, everything
connected with the matter is strictly con
fidential. I only know ttiat the Japanese
Government satisfied itself that the Amer
ican shipbuilders could compete with the
world and called for our bids. 1 believe
we will be given an opportunity to turn
out one, if not both, of those ships."
Before the contracts are awarded the
board in session at the legation at Wash
ington will consider the different plans
and specifications submitted and make its
recommendations to the Imperial Gov
ernment. It will be several weeks before
these reports reach Tokio, wbere they will
be considered and the contracts awarded,
if the plans submitted are accepted.
Palace Restaurant Failure.
Robert Matthey and Albert Young, pro
prietors of the Palace Restaurant on Market
street, have filed a petition in insolvency.
They owe $7096 44, and their assets amount
to $1500.
The principal creditors are grocers, produce
dealers and employes of the restaurant. There
is due the latter $211 30 bark wages.
Matthey owes personally $2450 outside the
debts of the firm and has no individual assets.
The insolvency is the result of an attachment
filed on Tuesday.
GOLDEN GATE CARNIVAL
More Than $11,000 in Sight,
With Large Corporations
,to Hear From.
Conceded That Recent Warm Remarks
Served to Advertise the
Carnival.
Reports made by members of the execu
tive committee of the Carnival of the
Golden Gate at the meeting held last
night showed that little more than $11,000
is in sight at present. This does not in
clude the large corporations, whose sub
scriptions will be made known between
now and next Monday.
Each member of; the committee made a
very favorable report. They stated that
some few did not like the idea of the car
nival in San Francisco for the reason that
they thought it was imitating the smaller
towns. Others thought were too
hard to have a carnival ; but an over
whelming majority declared themselves
in favor of it, and while their subscrip
tions would not be large, still? the com
mittee feels that they will be able to raise
the amount that will be required to suc
cessfully cany on the carnival.
Carnival Director Friedlander, at the
request of the Merchants' Association,
met with their executive committee yes
terday afternoon. He was informed that
the association as a body â  were ; too ' much
engrossed with their labors >on the new
charter, but with the exception of but one
member the others personally were < in
hearty accord and would subscribe. :"?&?S!S
There was a mutual expression of * good
feeling, and regret that any controversy
had arisen, but both sides conceded that
the warm remarks of the past- few days
had been of much benefit in bringing the
merits of the carnival directly before - the
public.
Colonel o' Byrne urged 1 a resolution to
express the sentiment of the members
that the carnival should be carried through
in all its original splendor and glory, and
that each member should use his best per
sonal efforts to induce his friends to con
tribute toward Us support. \
In order to accommodate, some of the
members of the committee who have taken
up ; their residence in the country during
the summer days and have been unable
to attend, the meetings will be held on
Monday at noon for : the next few weeks,
and with this understanding Henry J.
Crocker will again assume his position as
a member of the ; executive committee, 1 as
he '. expressed himself both verbally j and
by letter to several mem hers of the com
mittee ; ; as : being -heartily in accord with
its movements, and that his best efforts
will be - at any time at, the disposal of the
committee during the hours . in [ which *he
is in the City. "^BNBHBHHnBSSSI

NEAR THE TOP
OF TAMALPAIS.
Where the Gas Association
Men Held Their Final
Meeting.
T. R. PARSER IN CHARGE
A Glorious Ride Up the Moun
tain on the Scenic
Railway.
LUNCH IN THE BEDWOODS.
The Grand Ending to the Fourth
Annual Session of the Pacific
Coast Association.
The members of the Pacific Coast Gas
Association did something very much out
of the ordinary yesterday in closing their
fourth annual session.
They had b?en in session three days,
two of which were spent in this City, E.
C. Jones presiding, and during which
time business, strictly business, held sway.
Following in this line, a new president â
T. K. Parkerâ was elected to replace Mr.
Jones, and yesterday these two gentlemen
sat in bank, as it were, to fittingly con
duct the affairs of the society and call for
an adjournment of the meeting until one
year hence in this Cuy.
Nothing grander than this meeting can
be imagined. A hundred or more of the
brightest engineers in the far West were
assembled, and their place of reunion was
almost within a stone's throw of the sum
mit of Mount Tamalpais.
After a five-and-a-half-mile ride over the
Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic
Railway to an altitude of more than 1600
feet the meeting was called to order by
the retiring president, whose gavel re
sounded on a twenty-ton bowlder and
whose drinking-cup was filled by an ever
running mountain spring.
It was there, at the extreme limit
reached so far by the new road, a wonder
ful piece of engineering in itself, over
lookinc San Rafael, Mill Valley, San
Quentin, Sausalito, Tiburon, Racoon
Straits, the Sacramento River, Angel
Island, the Golden Gate and San Fran
cisco, that ex- President Â£. C. Jones relin
quished his scepter into the hands of T. R.
Parker of Napa.
The members of the association, except
ing J. h. Crockett, president of the Ban
Francisco Gaslight Company, whose
business detained him in the City, and M.
C. Osborne of Santa Cruz, whose illness
compelled him to stay away, were all
represented. With the members were
their wives, sisters and sweethearts, who
gathered beautiful ferns during the
meeting.
The party was handled from this side of
the bay by John A. Britton of Oakland,
the secretary of the association, who re
linquished his charge only when Mill
Valley was reached. At this lovely spot
8. B. Cushing, president of the San Rafael
Gas Company, provided a special train of
care to make the ascent of Mount Tamal
pais. After a short run to the outskirts of
Blythdale there was a halt in the heart of
the redwoods. Two tables were set and
thet>arty enjoyed a delightful luncheon
while listening to the strains of music
from a string band, the performers being
perched in the forKs of a dozen redwood
trees immediately above the banquet
board.
The host on this occasion, Mr. Cushing,
was toasted by his grateful guests and the
mountain ascent resumed.
Among the ladies present were:
Miss Emma B. Gossard, Mrs. John L. How
ard, Mrs. ana Miss B. A. Knight, Miss Grace
Sanborn, Mrs. John Clements, Miss March

Proofs of the photographs taken by 8. B.
Grimwood on Wednesday last by means of
the cathode ray have been mounted and
to-day will be distributed to ail the mem
bers of the association.
The objects subjected to the ray were a
pocket-book containing forty sheets of
writing paper, in the middle of which ex-
President Jones placed his association
badge. The result is most flattering, con
sidering that there was but a ten-minute
exposure, during which the ray pene
trated not only the sheets of paper, but
two thick leather covers as well.
HER DOCTOR'S BILL.
The Estate of .". Fhllllplne Langfeldt,
151 anther's Victim, Sued for Medi
cal Attendance.
Adolph Rapp, administrator of the es
tate of Phillipine Langfeldt, the ol.i uer
| man lady supposed to have been murdered
j by Josef Blanther, was sued yesterday by
j C. Klein eberg, the man in whose house
j the murder occurred, for $750 for services
alleged to have been rendered Mrs. Lang
feldt during her lifetime.
The complaint is very ambiguous and
makes absolutely no mention of the nature
of the alleged service. It is simply stated
that on June 13, 1896. Kleineberg pre
sented his claim to Mr. Rapp, and that on
June 18 it was rejected.
Dr. Kleineberg, on being seen yesterday,
sairt : "This is simply a suit to recover on
a claim for professional servicesâ medical
attendance. I had been treating Mrs.
Langfeldt for a long time for a complica
tion of diseases. I treated her before she
came here. She wanted to be near me,
where she could have the benefit of my
advice constantly, so she applied for and
rented her apartments in this bouse.
The contention is that she paid the bill
monthly. What she paid was her rent,
board and lodging. She did not pay her
bill for my services."
When Baby was sick, wa gave her Castoria.
When she was a Child, she cried for Castoria.
When Bhe became Miss, she clung to Castoria,
When she had Children, she gave them Castoria,

General Booth- Tucker Has
Arrived From the
East.
WILL SPEAK ON MONDAY
Influence of the Organization
Very Steadily In
creasing.
CRIMINALS TO BE HELPED.
From the Time of Their Arrest They
Will Never be Without Salva
tion Friends.
General Booth-Tucker, the commander
of the Salvation Army in the United
States, arrived in this City yesterday over
land from the East This is General Booth-
Tucker's second visit to San Francisco.
He was here last October, when there was
no dissension in the army's ranks.
As to how far the dissension has led, no
one is better qualified to judge than Gen
eral Booth-Tucker, for he has studied the
subject very closely in various parts of
the United States, and his personal ob
servations have been seconded by reports
made by his trusted lieutenants. General
Booth-Tucker brings news of importance.
The social work of the Salvation Army
will be widely extended and careful organ
ization will be perfected to insure care for
the criminal.
General Booth-Tucker grew very ani
mated and very earnest as he spoke of
this branch of the work. He raised his
hands with Irequent gestures and dwelt
with emphasis on his words-. "We shall
track the criminal from the time of his
arrest to the gallows or to bis passage out
through the prison doors. In every stage
he will find that lie has lriends in the
Salvation Army. The released criminal
will be rescued from his former associa
tions as much as possible. He will be
aided to employment. He will be assisted
in every way.
"Do "you know," continued the com
mander with growing enthusiasm, '-why
it is that tlie Salvation Army has such
vast power for good? No? Well, that is
due to the fact that our large organization
is always ready to give free service for
good. The poor among our members are
content to toil for the same fare that
comes to those to whom they lend succor.
The well-to-do class, who can support
themselves and who are our members, do
what they can absolutely free, and the
army is extending in influence, is growing
in the favor of all the nations and con
tinues to assimilate in all hind?, so that in
Germany it is a German army, in France
it is a French army and so on. This is
the more noteworthy because in Germany,
for instance, there is some feelinsr of na
tional irritation against the English, but
that does not result in any anta onism to
the balvation Army in England."
General Booth-Tucker was asked con
cerning the schism In the army in the
United States. "There are only two posts
of importance in this country in which
those who withdrew from the Salvation
Army have any considerable organized
strength, and those who left us must be
with us or they will accomplish nothing.
The two posts of which I spoke are near
to, but not in Chicago. They axe held by
officers who were, I think, or at least one
in particular, of bad faith. Wherever I
have been 1 noticed that those who have
withdrawn have found it necessary, or
have considered ie advisable, to estaDJish
their headquarters very close to ours. But
it is a mistake to think that the other or- !
ganization is distinctively or peculiarly j
American in respect to its leaders. There I
are many more of foreign birth in its list
of officers than there are Americans.
"We have large projects. I cannot
speak more of them now. There will be a
large meeting next Monday evening, and
then 1 will make an address. It would
not be well for certain reasons to antici
pate that too much. I have come to San
Francisco now because this is a peculiarly
favorable field for work. The authorities
are so kind that we receive from them
very valuable assistance. I reckon that
nowhere in the United States is the door
so wide open to us as it is in ban Fran
cisco. The San FranciÃCO police are kind
to us and we receive recognition and aid.
"We have a great field before us in the
United States.
"All over the world our movement is
growing. General Booth has met with re- I
markable receptions amonsr the 6oandina- |
yians. Twenty thousand people thronged
into the square by the railway depot in j
Stockholm to greet him. This was not be- i
cause a visit by him to that city is a
novelty. On the contrary, he has fre
quently been in Stockholm. The infer- !
ence is clear that the demonstration was
an indorsement of the work.
"We pass through three stages every.
Booth-Tucker. Who Brings Hope and Enthusiasm to the Salvationists Here.
where. At first we are abused; then we
are tolerated; next we are indorsed. The
toleration is ordinarily found at the end of
the first year and we advance in favor so
that during the second and third years
ami thereafter there is no objection to our
methods.
"Ihavefjust come from Washington.;
You have read about the proceedings of ,
the Christian Endeavor convention tnere.
A sign of tne times was the cordial invita
tions which the army has received to hold
exercises In leading "churches in the great j
cities of the United States. Dr. Cuyler of |
Brooklyn has tendered an invitation to )
occupy his church. Rev. Dr. Chapman of ]
Bethany Church, Washington, also ex
tended an invitation. ' .
"These are not isolated cases â by any
means. I may Ray that the fringe only of
the social work has been touched. I ex
pect that a very great advance will be
made: in San Francisco in this line of r en
deavor. We will go slowly, according to
our custom, for all our work must be self
supporting. Hence it is enduring."
General Booth-Tucker was accompanied
overland by some officers of the Salvation
Army. Brigadier Keppel returned with
him after completing . a tour through
many States. Major Milsaps, editor of
the War Cry, was also of the party. Cap
tain J. R. McFee of this City went to Oak
land to meet the general. â¢
â  To carry out his . plans, Commander
Booth-Tucker proposes the organization
of the Knights of Hope, a body of Salva
tionists which have charge of work in the
jails, prisons, reformatories and hospitals,
and which will have homes into vrbich
discharged convicts may be received; also
a League of Love, composed of women,
who will labor in the haunts of fallen
women and who will have charge of rescue
homes. Several homes will be established
for discharged convicts and also for fallen
women. These will be founded as soon as
possible. â¢: -â¢. ;: v :. *.

FOR McKINLEY.
Twenty - Eighth District
Republican Clubs
Reorganized.
NEW OFFICERS ELECTED.
Protection and Sound Money
Advocated and Will Be
Supported.
RATIFICATION IN AUGUST.
Piominent Orators Will Speak on the
Future Prospects of the Repub
lican Party.
William McKinley, the advocate and
expounder of protection and sound money,
has an able and influential ally in the
! Twenty-eighth Assembly District Central .
Republican Club.
That political club, which was instituted ;
two years ago, held a meetins and reor
ganized last Wednesday evening. The
Nineteenth Senatorial Fire Brigade Wig
wam, corner of Second and Folsom streets, j
which was built several years ago, has )
been remodeled and refitted at the ex
pense of the Twenty-eighth District Club
and will be used as the permanent head
quarters of that organization.
The Twenty-eighth District is situated
in the very heart of the manufacturing
and commercial district of the City. It is
bounded by Market, Bryant, Third and
East streets, and in that location are many
mills and factories which used to employ
hundreds of men and boys, but whicu are
now deserted, silent monumentt, which
| bespeak the result of four years of Democ
racy.
The members of the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict Club have noted these chances and
have all been more or less affected, and in
consequence they are all protectionists
and will tight for protection, that forerun- {
ncr of prosperity.
At the meeting held last Wednesday
evening officers were appointed to preside
during the coming campaign. The fol
lowing resolutions, which embody the
sentiments of the entire club, werÂ« offered
by Thomas J. Denehy and adopted:
Whereas, The Republican party in National
convention assembled has Dominated for the
highest offices In the gift of tne people of the
United States William McKinley of Ohio and
Garret A. Hobartoi New Jersey ; and whereas,
Baid candidntes stand upon a platform which
emphasizes in n marked degree tin- highest
form of protection to American labor and
American industries; and wherea?, the said
Republican plntforni favors sound money for
tbe transaction of the business of this com
munity and for use in its international rela
tions; therefore be. it
.Resolved, By the Twenty-eighth Assembly
lnÂ»trict Central Republican Club that we
heartily indorse the nominees of the Repub
lican convention, McKinley and Hobart, and
give our hearty support to each and every
plank of that platform ; and be it further
Â£tsolved. That the four years' ruie of the
Democratic party, under the peculiar manipu
lation of the powers vested by the constitu
tion in the President of the United States, has
resulted in a depression in business, which a
change to an honest, economical and business
like admiuixtration aione can relieve, we be
lieve is but one of the many cogent reasons for
the support of the party of protection, patriot
ism and prosperity.
Following are the officers:
President, N. H. Burnhum; first vice-presi
dent, W. 8. Ruwell; second vice-president, C.
G. Bolsdorff; third vice-presiaent, Ed Scully ;
recording secretary. Ed P. Peterson; corre
sponding secretary, John Durnen; treasurer,
Henry V. Miller; sergeant-at-arms, Joseph
Fritz Jr.
The president Â«ppointed the following com
mittees: Executive committeeâ Al Houston
(chairman), James 11. Daly, Thomas Bryant,
John E. O'Brien and Thomas J. Denehy.
Finance committeeâ Chris Dunker (chair
man), Dr. W. J. Hawkins, Samuel Bnortridne,

Early in August a rousing ratification
meeting will be held in the Wigwam.
Prominent orators will be called upon to
expound the history, traditions and future
prospects of the Republican party, which
has done so much for this couutrv and
which the members of the Twenty-eighth
Assembly District Central Depablican
Club will assist to victory in November.
BALDWIN IS BESIEGED.
Office-Hunters Render the Life of the
United States Marshal Almost
Unbearable.
United States Marshal Barry Baldwin
threatens to grow gray or, what is worse,
fall a victim to paresis unless there is a
let up in olfice-seekers. For 'two weeks
past there has been a continnal stream of
"de push" seeking Barry's sumptuous
quarters in the Appraiser's building in the
vain hope of being appointed Election
Supervisors or Marshals.
Farrisb, the Marshal's right-hand man,
declares, with much seriousness, that re
gardless of the lact that no regular busi
ness has been transacted for two months,
the courts and the Grand Jury not being
in session, he has never been so busy In
his life. He says it is practically impossi
ble to make the office-hunters understand
that the law requiring United States Mar
shals and Supervisors at every election
precinct was abolished four years ago.
In the meantime Baldwin has found a
temporary way out of the difficulty. When
he reaches the office he asks, if a stranger
happens to be on the inside, "Is Mr. Bald
win in?" Farrish, of course, catches right
on, and invites the Marshal to step inside
and "wait a few moments." When Barry
desires to leave he informs his head man
that he "cannot wait for Baldwin any
longer."
In this way the United States Marshal
goes to and from his office. The only
consolation he finds nowadays is to make
an occasional "escape" to Attorney Sam
Knight's office, where the two engage In
| an amicable discussion of gold and silver,
and why one is better for the country than
I the other.
MISS HARRADEN IS ILL,
Comes Here for a Change of
Air and Longs to Be
Home.
The Author of " Ships That Pass in
tbe Night" Now a Confirmed
Invalid.
Beatrice Harraden, the little English
woman who gained fame as a novelist by
writing "Ships That Pass in the Night,"
came here Wednesday from El Cajon, San
Diepo County, an invalid in search of a
change of air from which she hopes to de
rive strength sufficient to enable her soon
to hasten on her journey to her old home
in London.
A fraii constitution and overwork is the
cause of her present condition. Four
months ago she was compelled to stop
work on her latest novel, though she had
nearly finished it. Since that time she has
been failing in health, notwithstanding
the favorable climate of Â£1 Cajon, where
she has been living with Mr. and Mrs.
John Kendall, who came up with her from
Ban Diezo on the Santa Rosa and who are
now with her at the Occidental.
How long the unfortunate little
authoress will remain iv this City de
pends entirely upon ncr condition. She
is eaeer to start for England as quickly as
possible. Wednesday evenine she was too
ill to see any one. Mrs. Kendall, how
ever, furnished the information in reeard
to the plans of the little authoress, whose
Dest heroine returned to her home in Eng
land from a health resort and with her
death ended that pathetic, but eccentric
and fascinating story of "Ships That Pass
in the Night."
POSTAGE ON RAILROAD MAIL.
The Recent Order Is Being; Contested
by the Corporations.
Neither the Southern Pacific Company
nor the other railroad corporations of the
country propose to submit without a
struggle to the order of the postofflce
authorities providing that all mail matter
heretofore carried free by the railroads
shall be franked with postage stamps.
Attorneys are now ut Washington argu
inc the matter with the Federal authori
ties. Their claim for the rescinding of
the order is that each railroad has the
right to carry its own letters, and that it
has therefore the right to extend that
right to other railroads. It is further
claimed that so Ion? as no compensation
is received for carrying these letters there
is no violation of law.
Meanwhile the Southern Pacific is obey
ing the order only so far as it relates to
mail destined for points not on itÂ« own
lines, pending a final decision from Wash
ington, which is expected any day.
It is safe to predict that the corporations
will win tneir point, as they are too rich to
pay postage as other people are compelled
to do.
ALFORD WANTS
PARTY HARMONY.
The New Democratic Leader
Tackles the Local Sit
uation.
HE TAKES A BIG JOB.

White and Others as Party
Doctors.
A CONSULTATION NEXT WEEK.
The New State Chairman Will Lead
an Effort to Unite the Local
Factions.
Chairman Alford of the Democratic
State Committee and the new boy leader
of the party proposes to harmonize the
local party.
The brilliant and popular young Visalia
lawyer has had considerable experience
in politics for a politician of his years, but
it has been gained away down in the San
Joaquin Valley and not south of Market
street, in this wicked, boss-infested me
tropolis. Nevertheless, Mr. Alford has
tackled the job.
Alford has gone back to his home for a
few days to get ready to stay in San Fran
cisco during the rest of the campaign, but
he will be here again next weeK, when he
will take off his coat and proceed to pull
the local party together and put in rivets.
The chairman's plan is to have Congress
man Maguire, Senator White and a few
other party neavy-weiehts hold an in
formal meeting soon and constitute them
selves a committee on the good of the
order, which shall lay vigorous hoid on
the problem of Democratic unification and
try to evolve some plan to which a major
ity at least of both factions will agree, and
by which the two rival organizations shall
be merged into one.
Maguire. White and a few others have
been asked by Mr. Alford if they would as
sume che role of blessed peacemakers, and
Maguire, White and a few others have said
that they would. So next week, it is more
than likely, Mr. Alford will pre
side over a caucus of party volun
teers. This means that what has
all along been certain to occur is abont
to occur. The campaign is opening, the
time for real business has come and the
party leaders, who are interested in the
general success of the party, are facing the
necessity of doing something to stop the
civil war in the party's stronehoid.
Congressman Maguire would say little
yesterday beyond acknowledging that he
had consented to take part in the effort
planned, and others had little to say. Mr.
Maguire said that he knew of no definite
harmony plan and that the conference
would be mainly one to canvass the situa
tion and devise a plan. The party would
be defeated, he said, if the breach re
mained, and a non-factional effort would
be made to arbitrate the differences.
The Differences between the Buckleyites
and the Junta are, of course, comprised in
the problem of who shall coptrol the ma
chine. In the Junta there are a half-dozen
or so who shout "Njssism" and "clean pol
itics" while Sam Rainey, Ed Laniean and
John Daggett dominate the organization ;
but these shouters will be taken but little
account of, as they represent no practical
following.
Whatever be the plan adopted it will be
the creation of a new County Committee,
probably at a primary, the officers of
which shall be so appointed that each side
may believe that it will either have an
even chance or a chance to do primary
politics at the ballot-box.
The Buckleyites favor such a primary
plan and will submit to one if they are
given half the election officers. The
trouble will come with the Junta, in
which the little bosses who run thing?
know that at a fair primary they would be
relegated to the field.
Must Have Water.
Mr. George Golden, a farmer residing
near this city, went to the spring after a
pail of water. Contrary to Mr. Uolden's
anticipations he found that access to the
spring was cut off by two enormous black
snakes lying coiled up in the path and
which refused to give tne right of way to
the owner of the spring.
Mr. Golden secured a club and, with a
determination to assert his rights, pre
pared to kiil the snakes or make them get
out of the way; but the reptiles were not
to be frightened by a man and a club ai.d
when Mr. Golden neared them they both
showed fight to such an extent as to con
vince the owner of the spring that it vould
be not only uselet-s but dangerous to at
tack them with a club.
The snakes are said to have stood
straight up on their tails and not only re
fused to yield their place of refuse, but
showed rie;ht with such determination
that Mr. Golden concluded to return to
his home and secure a gun. Finding that
bis own sun waf not in shooting order, be
went to a neighbor near by and secured a
gun and then returned to the spring and
dispatched the snakes. It is said they
were about eight feet long ami quite large
iv circumference.â Cumberland Times.

CYCLERS OUT FOR
SMOOTH STREETS
Leading Dealers Explain
the Significance of
the Parade.
DISPLAYi OF STRENGTH.
Will Concentrate Their . Efforts
First to Repave Market
Street
WILL WIELD A TELLIHG VOTE.
Wheelmen Claim That They Have
the Balance of Power on
Their Side.
The bicycle dealers and bicycle riders of
this City intend to precipitate â in fact are
precipitating â the widespread feeling of
weariness begotten by the wretched pave
ments of San Francisco into a definite
warfare of improvement that ultimately
and not very far hence means victory and
well paved, smooth and durable thorough
fares, i
Back of them they have all the powerful
improvement organizations of this City,
among which are the Merchants' Associa
tion and the Associated Improvement
Clubs.
To - morrow nieht there will be a
mammoth parade of more than 4000
wheelmen, together with floats, bands and
companies of men on horseback.
This parade is intended not solely for
the purpose of jollification over the pav
ing of one street but a demonstration of a
potent palling factor that cannot be over
looked by candidates for municipal office
at the comiug election. It will be an in
fluence that will be thrown in favor of the
officeseeker who possesses the broad
mindedness to see the ultra importance of
well-paved, city streets.
A number of tbe prominent bicycle
dealers of this City were interviewed
to ascertain the wnole significance of
t c demonstration to-morrow evening.
Each one emphasized the fact that
the first effort would be toward the
repaying of Market street owing to its
importance as an outlet to the ferries of
all tbe principal streets, after this a gen
eral street improvement is desired.
Bitumen is not specified, only smooth,
durable pavements; in fact, anything but
the rougb and noisy cobblestones, which
at present figure as the greatest disgrace
of San Francisco. '
Manager Foster of the Cycle Emporium
of T. H. JtJ. Varney said: "The object
of the parade is to get better streets. Well
paved streets not only benefit cyclers, but
they benefit the City in general.
"We expect to have Market street re
paved by this demonstration. Now that
the election is so near the idea is to vote
for Supervisors who will bind themselves
to repaying Market street.
"Market street is the fight. It is our
main thoroughfare. It is a shame that a
city like San Francisco, which is situated
financially better than any city in Amer
ica, should have the poorest streets in
America. We have uad men come in here
riding in buggies who said they would do
all they could toward fighting this thing.
"The enthusiasm that this demonstra
tion will arouse will show t: at the public
want Market street repaved, and the can
didate for office will naturally conform to
the wishes of the public and embody this
in his pledge. We want to stir up the
people to cast their vote for men who will
repavu Market street. We ourselves wield
a strung influence at the polls, and of
course our voting will be pledged with the
men who pledge themselves to this.
"But the main thing that this demon
stration will be instrumental in will be
the amount of agitation it will provoke
among t..e entire voting public of San
Francisco toward getting smooth and
durable street pavements.
J. S. Con well, manager of the Indiana
Bicycle Company, said:
"Primarily, the object of the parade is
to educate tbe wheelmen of this town up
to a realizing sense of their own strength.
Our chief encouragement comes from the
fact that in all the larger cities of tbe East
parades of a similar nature have
in awakening the public mind to Ã¼blic
action, and all the well-wishers of those
cities have come to regard the bicycle as
the cause of the improvement, the main
tenance and good construction of the
roads in cities, villages and in the open
country.
"We have been joining in the slogan of
'Repave Market street.' We know it is
merely a remote wish. We know that be
fore this can happen we must reform the
City Government, and to that end the
Cycle Board of Trade has unanimously
declared in favor of the adoption of the
new charter.
"I deem it a duty of every wheelman and
every horseman, and every well-wisner of
San Francisco to study our present exces
sive law and lack of system, and to com
pare the same with the provisions of the
new charter. I claim that such study
and sucn comparison will force upon every
intelligent citizen the necessity of
change."
Edmund Christ, manager of the Steams
Bicycle Company, said:
"The real object of the parade is to pave
the streets. We all know the robberies
going on in these different departments.
"We expect the bicyclists will have a
very strong pull thi3 year. It was an
earnest of it last year when Judge Kerri
gan was elected. A great number more of
bicycles could be used if it were not for
bad pavements. Ttiis is not simply a
temporary boom. It is a demonstration
to show the strength and power of the cy
cling public. We will let the powers that
be see that they can't dictate to us. This
is not a trade affair. This is a public af
fair."
James Joyce Jr., one of the managers of
the Cleveland Bicycle Company, said:
"Tbe object of this paraie is to get bet
ter-paved streets all over town, but princi
pally on Market street. This thorough
fare is tne principal outlet of wneels to and
from the ferry.
"This parade will be an object lesson to
show the high in office that the wheelmen
are a unit to get well-paved streets. This
is not a matter of interest to tbe dealers
only, but the clubs as well.
"Good streets will advance the price of
real estate and will mean the greatest good
to the greatest number of people. We
cannot hope to do a great deal until tbe
adoption of the new charter, which we are
fighting for. We have back of us at least
15.000 wheelmen, all voters."
William V. Bryan of the Sterling Com
pany said: "There are two reasons why
we are working for good streets; first, a
selfish reasonâ it will create a greater de
mand for cycles; second, which is broader
and more catholic, it will stimulate trade
and promote traffic of all kinds. Well
paved streets will eive business a
greater prosperity in our City. It will
make connection between business houses
easier. You see it really goes far beyond
mere bicycle usage. Ido not believe there
is a man in this town who is not in favor
of this movement.
"History shows that the cities given the
greatest success are those whose streets
are the better paved. There has an im
pression gone abroad, particularly among
teamsters, that our object is to have the
streets paved with bitumen. This would
savor of a job and is not by any means the
case. We do not care at all what the pave
ment ie so long as it is durable and smooth.
"We have come to the conclusion that
the only way to obtain our end is ti. rough
political effort. In other words we pro
pose to vote for men who are in unison
with our ideas. The wheelmen are a unit
on this one point only and will vote for
th# Supervisor or Street Superintendent
v#.o pledges himself to work for good
streets."
"This parade," said J. T. Bill of the
Cleveland Wheel Company, "will en
thuse people to realize tbe idea that we
want better streets. The object is to show
th â  strength of the wheelmen. Whatever
causes talk will leave an impression on a
person's mind.
"In the East they have these parades
and accomplish much good. The object
is to create a popular feeling for good
roads. This pa rade will show up tbe real
strength of tne cyclers in this City. We
would have the balance of power surely in
an election.
"A cyclist more fully realizes the im
portance of good roads than the ordinary
citizen, and it is right that be should take
the lead in such a movement. The first
object is to get at least one good street in
the City. Others will follow."
W. M. Pbelps of the Overman Wheel
Company said: "The riders in tbe pro
cession will dismount on Market street to
show to the people that it is not fit to ride
on. It will show the people the great
strength of the cyclers as a voting power.
"The only way we can get the streets
repaved is by getting some kind of a
pledge from the Supervisors before their
election, to this end. When this comes to
an issue I know that the bicycle
people will stand in and assist in
every way. Our greatest opposition
will be the Market - street Railway
company. I have heard it reported that
the railroad people were instrumental in
having the streets sprinkled at that hour
of the day, when wheelmen, leaving their
places of business, wish to ride home. It
the slot is wet it is positively dangerous to
ride on it.
"This is a business proposition and a
broad â¢ gauge proposition, and I know
that we will win."
Percy Easton, manager of the Lv Mi
Num Cyclery, said: "One of the princi
pal features of the parade will be to let the
non-wheelmen of San Francisco see what
a number of wheelmen there are, and alsc
to let them see that the wheel vote is
worth something about election time. And
I the Street Commissioners who advocate
I good roads and Market-street inprove
ment will be better able to judge of their
chances for office. There is no doubt that
we have the worst paved streets ol any
city in the land.
"I would suggest that as a starter the
railroad companies be compelled to pave
between their tracks with bitumen. This
would make a place for cycles and car
riages to run."
J. M. Fahold, manager of the
and Crawford wheels, said: "The streets
! of S^an Francisco cannot compare with
i any city in the United States. Anything
that will call attention to the condition of
Market street will do good.
"A person takes bis life in his own
hands when he rides on that street. The
wheelmen as a class arc becoming larger
every day and more influential as a poll
ing power. If they concentrate at the
polls for one end they will be sure of
success."
James H. Hamilton of the firm of Baker
& Hamilton said: "This parade will show
, our political strength" toward securing
â  good pavements anywhere in the City.
j We think we will give thÂ« politicians an
: idea as to what the wheelmen are. There
j are wheelmen everywhere in this City
ready to throw their vote either way."
"We will get in our work later on," said
R. C. Denney, manager of the Morgan <fc
"Wright tire on this coast. "The wheel
! men are banded together in a body, and
those men who are running for political
positions who will give them â not promise
them only â tlieir support toward good
pavements will secure the entire wheeling
vote.
"Not only their votes, but the votes of
their friends also. The wheelmen figure
on controlling over 35.000 votes at the next
election, and they want good roads, irre
-1 ! gardless of the partisanship of the man
J running for office."
W. R. Wheeler, one of the managers of
| the Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson firm,
' said:
"We are interested as dealers in seeing
the bicycle made an instrument of utility
as well as of pleasure. We believe we
should have good streets here as well as in
other cities.
"The Cycle Board of Trade is not advo
cating any special kind of pavement. It
wants simply a good pavement.
"This demonstration wiii be an index of
i our desire, our needs and our determina
! ! tion. The wheelmen are a mighty politi
i | cal power, and I feel convinced that they
, : will win their fieht.'
''If the cyclers care for a practical sug.
; gestion here it is," said Wells Drury, who
is himself a wheelman and has tuffered
i from the cobblestones on Market street.
â¢ j "My idea is that the only way to get de
cent streets and keep them decent is to
! have a practical wheelman for Superin
: temlent of Btreets.
i "If you put in that position a man who
: goes out on his bike every day, or even
i ; once a week, you are sure to have proper
i attention paid to the City's thoroughfares.
' The way to get a wheelmen for Superin
t tend ent of Streets is a very simple thing,
i as I will illustrate by a short story.
"In a community in Nevada where I
! once lived the Sheriff of the county is al
ways a member of the Miners' Union.
Tbe reason of this is that tbe miners will
i never vote for any nominee for Sheriff un
less he be a member of their organization.
The miners hold the balance of power,
i and each convention is compelled to nomi
nate a member of the union. After the
I | nominations are made the motto is: 'A
I ; fair field and no favors, and may the best
â  man win.'
"Just in like manner the wheelmen in
i San Francisco hold the balance of power
' in regard to tne man who is to look after
I the streets, and if they declare their wishes
r j in proper form, that is to vote lor no man
I for Superintendent of Streets except he is
a wheelman, they will be able to have in
that important position a man who will
deal justly and intelligently with the affairs
of the Street Department."
"San Francisco is away behind the times
in the proposition of good streets," said
A. A. Martin, manager of the bicycle de
partment of the Emporium. "Even San
Jose is far ahead of us. it is as much as a
â  man's life is worth to ride down Market
, street in its present condition.
"The Emporium is laying a pavement at
its own expense to run the length of the
building. It will have basalt blocks as a
foundation, on which will be placed
cubical blocks of wood thoroughly tarred.
This will make a smooth, noiseless pave
r ment, and it is intended by thr Emporium
as a practical demonstration of what
Market street should be.
"Agitations of the nature of this parade
always do good. It will show to persons
1 who do not ride wheels that bicyclists are
not all mere boys and girls, but reputable
business men. "This will have its affect at
i the approaching election. Smoothly
i paved streets will enhance the value of
real estate and boom business."
Charles Watt, manager for George Webb
f Alexander and Pacific Coast agent for the
1 Yost-Falcon wheel, said yesterday: "Our
s demonstration next Saturday evening
s will get people thinking about the condi
s tion of the street-. It will stir up the
; voting class to a proper understanding of
the importance of good streets. It will
also show tbe politicians that the bicyclists
form a power that cannot be "safely
ignored. 1
â¢'Of coarse, we recognize the fact that to
increase the bicycle business we must have
s better-paved streets. We desire also to
â¢ make the bicycle not only a medium of
pleasure, but a vehicle of business. lam
I one of tbe oldest bicycle riders in town,
i but I have used my wheel very little of
late, simply because it is too dangerous to
i do so. There are hundreds of business
â¢ men who would ride to their offices and
places of business if the streets permitted
i such a thing.
i "But there is a broader motive than
this. Good streets will make our City
; more prosperous. Nearly all ot our mem
t bers belong to the Merchants' Association,
1 and we are in harmony with everything
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1896.
that will better the City. The money
spent patching up Market street would
soon pay for a brand new pavement.
"Also, we are fcoing to work for the
new charter. Ido not believe we can ac
complish much unless we do. I know of
no other large city in the world that is not
bonded. I believe our children should pay
for some of our improvements. This
parade will be under the Bicycle Board of
Trade, but we are with the merchants and
tbe merchants are for general improve
ment."
J. H. Brunings, member of the firm of
Hooker & Co., said: "This parade is
simply the first step. It will show the
strength of the wheelmen. They must get
their work in at the ballot, and if they
make a good showing Saturday night it
will be the starter of complete victory. If
the wheelmen will hang together they can
wield with their influence 25,000 votes.
This is really the first opportunity the
wheelmen have had to show their strength,
although when Judge Kerrigan was
elected it was the cyclists who did it, and
they can now put him where they want to.
and are willing to do so.
"The Cycle Board of Trade has been the
means of bringing the wheelmen together
and now they make an almost irresistible
power."
"The demonstration of Saturday night,"
said S. M. How, Pacific Coast manaeer of
the Monarch Cycle Manufacturing Com
pany, "will show in the plainest kind of
language the voting cycle population. It
will be a stroke toward the repavincr of
Market street. Take, for instance, a man
who is running for office and let him make
repaying one of the principles of his policy,
and he will then get a strong backing. I
can cite a similar instance to this demon
stration that happened in Chicago. A
company there tried to get a franchise to
run an electric line on the side of a West
End boulevard. The cyclists got together,
bad parades, mass-meetings, etc., and the
result was the city refused to grant the
franchise.
"This parade will start people to talking
and will create much enthusiasm, and the
city fathers will begiu to realize that they
must do something."

NOW COMES THE PARADE.
A Novel and Magnificent Wheel
Pageant Is Assured for To-
Morrow Night.
The executive committee for the cyclists'
demonstration, composed of members

TO TEST THE CLIMATE,
Object of tbe Sojourn of Dr. A.
F. McKay, an Expert
From the East.
Will Report on Its Advantages for
Invalid S ekers After Health
and Homes. \
During the next five months California
is to have her climate and soil experted
with a view toward determining what dis
eases, if any, are indigenous to the State,
and what qualifications and conditions
exist that will prove beneficial and attrac
tive to health and home seekers.
Dr. A. F. McKay, corresponding secre
tary of the Chicago World's Congress of
Medical-Ciimatologists, arrived here yes-
A. P. McKay, M. D., Corresponding Sec
retary of World's Chicago Congress
Medico Association.
terdav from Chicago, and will spend the
remainder of this year traveling about the
State, taking in every section.
The work be is engaged in is novel and
unique, and has probably no parallel in
tbe world. It was decided upon at Chicago
by the World's Congress of Medical-
Climatologists during the World's Fair
held there in 1893, and ever since Dr. Mc-
Kay has moved from State to State, in
vestigating each on the lines mentioned
in the opening paragraph. Thus far he
has visited Colorado, Nebraska, South
DaKota, Wisconsin, Utah, Texas, Arkan
sas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Jiew Mexico
and Arizona.
The results of Dr. McKay's investiga
tions are published in the Journal of
Diagnosis and Climatology, of which he
is tbe editor. It is published monthly
and has a large circulation among invalid
home-seekers all over the world.
Dr. McKay finds the work very congenial
and has given up all his medica. practice
in order to be able to devote his entire
attention to this project. In the course
of an interview yesterday Dr. McKay
said:
I expect to devote about five months
to the work of investigating and report
ing upon the climate and health resources
of California, covering the entire State. I
shall begin in the southern portion and
work northward, completing the task by
January.
"These reports will t>e in no sense a
write-up of the places mentioned. They
will simply go into the details of climatic
data and the advanta es offered to home
seekers from a purely healthful stand
point. They will give facts as far as it is
possible to obtain them. After they ap
pear in monthly serial form each year's
work is revised and put into permanent
shape in a bound volume, indexed for
reference. The last volume was issued in
August, 1895. It i 8 expected that by 1900
the entire United States will have" been
covered systematically, every report being
ba?ed upon personal investigation by my
self.
THE REPUBLICAN
DECKS ARE CLEARED
Campaign Literature Is
Ready for the State
Conflict. .
TO BE SOWN NEXT WEEK
\
Encouraging Reports Already
Rolling In at the State
Headquarters.
FIFTH DIBTEICT POLITICS.
The Congressiona Convention Will
Be Called in a Few Days to Name
a Congressman.
The Republican State campaign has
fairly struck the speedy gait and entered
on the aggressive activity that will char
acterize it from now until November 3.
The appearance and buoyant feeling of
campaign life pervades the rooms of the
State Central Committee, and early next
week those who visit the said headquar
ters will realize the fact that activity has
begun.
For one thing there will next week be
issued by wholesale the first batches of
campaign literature. The literary com
mittee, consisting of A. B. Lemmon,
Chairman McLaughlin, Secretary Hig
gins, H. Z. Osborne, W. F. Parker and
E. F. Preston, have in preparation and in
press pamphlets and effective campaign
material in other forms which will next
week be scattered broadcast through the
State through county committees and
other a.-encies.
The first campaign document was issued
yesterday, in fact. It is an attractive and
artistically designed little hanger, about
6x14 inches in size, presenting excellent
pictures of William McKinley and Garret
A. Hobart and the slogan, "Patriotism,
Protection and Prosperity." About 50,000
of these will be scattered thronch the
State to be hung up any and every where,
framed or unframed. by Republicans who
are proud of their National ticket.
The correspondence of the executive
committee, conducted mainly by Secretary
M. R. Higuins and Chairman McLaugh
lin, is already becoming voluminous.
The committee is in constant correspond
ence with the county committees and
party leaders throughout the State, there
by keeping in close touch with party af
fairs in every section. The reports of the
chairmen and secretaries of county com
mittees tiot written for publication, but to
eive accurate and confidential informa
tion, are all highly nattering to the party
prospects.
Congressman Bowers, for instance,
writes from San Diego:
"The situation here is as elsewhere. A
few Republicans are off on silver, but
many will come back into camp before
election. We will gain more Democrats
than we will lose Republicans."
From the County Committee of Ventura
County comes this report:
"Everything here points to a good vote
for AJcKinley. A laree number of in
fluential Democrats will decline to sup
port free siiver, and there are no losses o*n
tbe Republican side."
A communication from Napa County
contains this report, which ;s typical of
many others :
"The silver craze that swept over this
county a short time ago has about died
out, as the people see that there is nothing
in it."
A letter from Orange County says:
"Registration is slow, but every indica
tion is favorable to the Republican ticket."
From every quarter come reports of the
intense feeling that protection is the chief
issue of the campaign. The chief indus
tries of the State are languishing, and the
people realize that free trade is what is
the matter with them. From Fresno the
following was received yesterday by Secre
tary Higgins:
"With the wool, raisin and lumber in
terests the protective tariff is the vital
question in this county, overshadowing
the silver issue. We are satisfied that we
will gain more Democrats whose interests
are affected by the tariff than we will lose
Republicans on account of silver."
FIFTH DISTRICT POLITICS.
The Republican Convention Will
Very Soon Be
Called.
There will soon be a lively and general
party interest in the coming Republican
Congressional Convention of the Fifth Dis
trict, which has yet to name a candidate
for Congress.
The convention adjourned at Sacra
mento to the call of the chaii, and the
chairman, James Alva Watt, is expected
to issue the call within a very few days.
Nothing has yet developed to indicate
whom the convention may name.
There are a number of names which are
constantly mentioned in connection with
the nomination, but the only aspirant
who is yet making an active and aggres
sive campaign for tbe nomination is
County Clerk C. F. Curry.
Mr. Curry has the backing of many
friends and declares himself confi
dent of securing tbe nomination. Julius
Kahn and Frank H. Powers are more
quietly interested in their own fortunes in
the same field.
Alfred Bouvier is a later candidate.
Loud and his friends have not yet begun
an open canvass in the present Congress
man's behalf.
The prospects of Republican success in
the Fifth District are so exceptionally as
suring this year that new candidates may
be expected to enter the held ana make
strong efforts to secure a nomination that
virtually means an election.
The Fifth District, especially in that
portion comprising Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties, will demand protection
above everything else this year. Santa
Clara County raises half the prunes pro
duced by the State, and the Wilson bill
has dealt this great industry a prostrating
blow along with others upon which these
counties depend for their prosperity.
Joseph P. Kelly will be quickly repudi
ated by so large an element of the Demo
cratic party who cannot abide the candi
date of Rainey, Daggett, Lanigan and the
"push" that opposition to tne Republican
candidate will be still further weakened. Â£
The plans of the Populists in tbe Fifth
District are as uncertain in t: c minds of
the Populist leaders themselves as they
have been all along. They will make up
their minds when the St. Louis trouble is
over. Mayor Sutro and Taylor Rogers,
who was the Populist nominee two years
ago, are the only ones who have been
prominently mentioned for the nomina
tion. Now it is understood that Mayor
Sutro does not want to enter such a losing
fight, and leading members of the party
do not believe that Ro-ers will be the man.

The Young Men's Republican League
had an enthusiastic meeting in Justice of
the Peace Kerrigan's courtroom last night,

A MOTORMAN'S VICTORY.
A Very Important Decision
Affecting Indemnity De
posits.
Railway Companies Cannot Withhold
Deposits Withont Securing Legal
Judgment.
C. N. Hinkle, formerly a motorman in
the employ of the Oakland Railway Com
pany, has won a victory over the South
ern Pacific Company, of which the Oak
land line is a part, Hinkle, like all other
employes of his ciass, was obliged to de
posit $25 with the streetcar company as
a bond to insure the latter against damage
to the car or other property under his
charge. At the same time he was obliged
to take out a large policy in the Pacific
Surety Company, which insures the rail
road people against all loss or damage
caused by carelessness or neglect on the
part of those insured.
On April 30 Hinkle was so unfortunate
as to run into a woman with his car. She
threatened to sue the streetcar company
for damages, but the case was compro
mised for $250 without going to court.
The company discharged Hinkle and kept
his $25, at the same time calling upon the
surety company for the difference, $225.
Hinkle called upon Labor Commissioner
Fitzgerald, to see if he could get back his
$25 deposit, claiming that the surety com
pany, to which he had paid all the assess
ments due, was responsible for all loss and
that the streetcar company had no right
to divert the deposit to any purpose other
than for damage to the car. The Labor
Commissioner's attorneys, Bonta & Engs,
took up Hinkle's case and began a suit
against tne Southern Pacific Comuany for
the $25.
The case came up yesterday Jus
tice Kerrigan. Hinkle's lawyers argued
that there are two classes of indemnity
contracts, one against liability outside of
the company's property, and the second is
against loss and damage relating particu
larly to the company's property. The
present contracts existing between the
street railroad companies and their em
ployes are of the latter class. Under a
contract there was no loss or damage to
the indemnified and could not be until it
should be forced to pay under court pro
ceeding. In the case in question the evi
dence showed that the street railway com
pany made a settlement or compromise
outside of the jurisdiction of the court,
and therefore the transaction did not mil
itate against the employed.
Justice Kerrigan took a similar view
and added that the indemnity contract
was without consideration and conse
quently void. He gave judgment and
costs in Hinkle's favor.
This decision is of great importance, be
cause several thousand railroad and street
car employes are in the same situation
that Hinkle was. In the hands of the
streetcar companies are thousands of
dollars on deposit.
A LAW POINT.
Decision of the Supreme Court a* to
the Admission in Evidence of Pro-
fessional Communications.
The Supreme Court yesterday reversed
tbe judgment of the lower tribunal in the
case of Samuel G. Murphy and the Pacific
Bank against Columbus Waterhouse. The
action was brought to recover $10,000 se
cured by Waterhouse from the bank on a
promissory note, and in the lower court
the judgment was in the bank's favor. In
Waterhouse's appeal he contended that
the lower court had erred in excluding the
testimony of Attorney Dorn, who was
present when the note was made, and was
not allowed to testify by the court on the
ground that he was the bank's attorney
and his knowledge was obtained in the
way of a privileged communication. The
Supreme Court decided that the testimony
of Dorn was wrongly excluded, being
privileged only as to strangers and not as
to the persons whom he represented.
Error was also found in the instruction of
the lower court to the jury, the jurors hav
ing been told that their minds must be
convinced by the testimony adduced,
whereas a weight of evidence or preponder
ance of probabilities is sufficient in civil
cases.
Country roads in China are never
bounded by fences, brU are utterly unde
fined. While the farmer has a fight to
plow up any road passing through his
land drivers of vehicles have an equal
right, and they exercise it, to traverse any
part of the country at large.
THE DIVISION ADJUTANT.
General N. T. James Appoints
Coonel J. C. Currier Chief
of Staff
The New Appointee Has a Splendid
Record of Service on the
Battlefield.
Major-General Nathaniel T. James,
whose commission as division commander
of the National Guard of California was
received last Monday, has appointed
Colonel J. C. Currier assistant adjutant
general and chief of staff. General James
said yesterday that no other appointments
would at present be made.
It is known that the selection of Colonel
j Currier as adjutant-general oi the division
Colonel J. C. Currier, Assistant- Adjutant
General.
is highly gratifying to Governor Budd,
although the latter has not recommended
any one for staff duty.
Colonel Currier is regarded by military
men as an officer of merit and capability.
He served with distinction as an officer of
Union volunteers during the war. He saw
active service in the greatest campaigns of
tbe war and was more than once severely
wounded on tbe field of battle. He served
in the Eleventh New Hampshire Infantry
at Vicksburg and in the Wilderness. In
the battle of the Wilderness he was
wounded, and again wounded at Peters
burp.
After the war closed he was commis
sioned as second lieutenant in the
Twenty-first United States Infantry and
brevetted first lieutenant and captain
for gallant and meritorious services at the
battles of the Wilderness and Poplar Spring
Church. In 1869 he came to California.
In 1890 be was appointed by President
Harrison United States Pension Agent for
the Pacific Coast. He was subsequently
appointed by General Dimond division
inspector of the National Guard of the
State.
In the work of completing the reorgani
zation of the National Guard the new di
vision commander desired the advice and
assistance of a man who hart served in the
volunteer army, in the regular army and
in the euard. Colonel Currier possessed
the qualification desired and his selection
was maae without hesitation. The man
ner in which he performed his duty as
division inspector did not escape the ob
servation of'the Governor.

OUCCESS IS ALWAYS CERTAIN TO
0 follow the use of Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt, as it fills the system with the warm- .
ing, invigorating electric current for hours
at a time. Electricity is strengthening to
the nerves, and when it can be applied so
easily by Dr. Sanden's method it enables
the patient to get the full benefits of the
life-giving power without interfering with,
the regular habits of living. It is possible
to make the electric current . strong or
mild in a moment while the belt is on the
body, thus removing all the inconveni-
ences incidental to Â» the use of a battery
and other electric appliances.
Let People Know.
BR.A.T.SA B^E^ NCISC Â°' May S 1896
Dear. Sirâ l want you to let people know
what your Belt nas done for me. When I
bought it last December I was troubled with a
continual pain in the back and sometimes ex-
tending up to the shoulder blades. I had been
troubled for years and had tried everything in
the line lof doctors and I advertised remedies
without relief. I was also very constipated
ana ha i to take laxatives every day. I finally â 
made up my mind to try one of your Belts and
lam glad I did so. In about three weeks after
putting the Belt on all the pain had gone, and
I have felt none since. My'back is now strong
and will stand all the strain , I can put on it
â¢without hurting. B My bowels are as regular as
clockwork, and I have gained ten pounds in
weight I shall always speak, well of your
Belt, for it has done for me what nothing else
could do. I think it is the best thing ever in-
vented for the cure of weakness and disease.
. Yours truly, HENRY STRICKER,

APPEARS TO BE A SUICIDE.
She Was respondent Because Her
Husband Left Her Without Propjr
Means of Support.
The body of Mrs. Susie Pinkerton, 20
years of age, lies at the Morgue.
Monday night the young woman, who
was rather poorly dressed, applied at the
Mrs. Susie Pinkerton Who Was Found Dead in a Room on Vallejo Street Early
Yesterday Morning.
J lodging-house 801 Vallejo street for a
room. She paid 25 cents and was assigned
to a rather ill furnished apartment.
There was nothing in the appearance of
the young woman to indicate either sui
cide or bad health.
At noon yesterday sne had not risen,
and as no response came from the room
when the door was rattled the landlady
became much alarmed and forced an en
trance into the room. On the floor was
- fonnd the body of the dead woman.
She was fully dressed, but there was
nothing to indicate a struggle. From out
ward appearances death seems to have
come from natural causes. On the floor
near tbe body wa* a sheet ot writing paper,
â which, under the microscope, showed the
following: "322 â 12 st." Just under this
appeared the letters: "Surâ Sull." The
figures and letters had been evidently
scratched with a pin.
James Royal, who keeps a grocery under
the room occupied by the girl, says that
during the night he heard a fall, followed
by moaning. He thought it was a chair
or some heavy object, and paid no atten
tion to it.
Mrs, Pinkerton ia the mother of two
children, who are inmates ot the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society in the Western Ad
dition. Her husband, who is now in the
East, contributed nothing toward the sup
port of his family and the young woman
was forced to gain a livelihood for herself
and babies.
Up to a few days ago she was employed
as a domestic at 808 Filbert street. She
left that position and went to live with her
sister-in-law. Mrs. Hendricks, 322 Twelfth
street. She appeared to be despondent,
and it is presumed that during one of
these spells she went to the lodging-house
and committed suicide.
THE PUGS AND PURSES
Maher Has Refused All Offers
and Will Not Meet Choyn
ski in This City.
Charley Mitchell Will Bex the Irish
Champ on in New York
City.
There is very little prospect of Maber
Bfid Choynski meeting in this City under
the auspices of any local athletic organiza
tion.
Yesterday afternoon Connolly and
Maher held a conference with some of the
directors of the Olympic Club, and after
discussing pugilistic matters for some time
Connolly said positively that unless he
was guaranteed a purse of $6000 be would
not consent to a contest between Joe and
Peter.
The club offered him $3500 casb down
and an equal division of tne net receipts,
but Connolly shook his head and replied
in the negative. When Director Short
saw that it was only a waste of time to try
and induce Maber's manager to accept
anything short of a $0000 purse, he called
the meeting adjourned permanently.
When Connolly returned to the Bald
win Hotel he was handed a message from
bis partner in business, John J. Quinn,
which read: "Get Ciioynski for NÂ«w
York. Charley Mitchell will box Mahir
t four round-." * .
F "That settles the question," orian y re
torted Connolly, as he jammed the mes
sage into his vest pocket. "You see,
everything is all O h for September, and
we will pull $10,000 nouses in New York.
"We would be foolish to accept a small |
purse in this City and take cuancea of los

I box at one of the local theaters here with
I some of Frisco's big scrappers on Wednes

BASEBALL UPHEAVAL.
A Team of the City League Deserts
and Join* the State Organ
ization.
There was an upheaval in local baseball
circles yesterday. The California Club of
the City League withdrew from that or
ganization and entered the California
League ranks. The change came in the
nature of a surprise to .Manager Rock
well, who was preparing to bill the bolters
for a game at Presidio Pars on Sunday.
The City League, since its inception two
months ago, has undergone several
changes. There were originally three
clubs, the Pacincs, Imperials and Call
fornias. Later, the all-Oakland team,
managed by Tip O'Neill and Lou Hardie,
was admitted. The latter, however, with
drew after playing one game and joined
the State League.
Now the Californias have followed them.
Despite this fact, however, Manager Rock
well ia by no means discouraged. He has
already had three applications from promÂ»
inent amateur clubs to step into the place
left vacant by tbe Californias, and has de
cided to give "The Calls" a chance. They
will cross bats with the Pacincs next Sun
day.
The State League, too, has not been
without its vicissitudes. The San Jose
team proved a very weak one, and when
O'Neill's Oaklands joined the leagne the
old Oakland team replaced the Garden
City men.
Even now they are hardly able to cope
with either the San Franciscos, new Oak
lands or Stocktons, " so there will now be
a general mix-UD. The players of the
Californias will be bunched with those of
the teams of the State League and three
new clubs chosen from the lot, thus keep
ing the number of clubs at four. This
j will necessarily strengthen all of tbem.
The change will not cripple anybody,
! and tbe usual games will be played at
both the Presidio Park and at the Folsom
street grounds on Sunday. There will
; also be a contest at the latter place to
j morrow.
HOPES THAT WERE VAIN,
The Fruitless Working and
Waiting of Miss Maria
B. Owens.
After Fifteen Weary Years She Finds
She Cannot Cairn a Promised
Lgacy.
Maria B. Owens is a disappointed, dis
gusted woman, for she has had to stand
the loss of no less than $20,000, for which
the has been working and waiting for fif-
teen years.
In 1881 Lawrence McNally, a single man
of 54 years, and of fine address withal,
dawned upon ' the Owens' homestead in â 
Michigan. There he met the confiding
Maria. The result of their meeting was a
contract, by the terms of which Maria was
to go and live with Lawrence, take care of
him i and manage his domestic affairs
until death. Lawrence on his part claimed
to have $20,000, which he promised to leave
to Maria in his will if she kept her part of
the contract.
And so Maria Owens left her home and
kin in Michigan and devoted herself to
McNally. She worked early and late, kept
his house neat as a pin and his clothes â¢ in
prime condition, but Lawrence repaid her
by taking a wife. â¢
Then Lawrence died and died intestate,
but he was not long dead when the case of
Maria B. Owens against Alice > McNally,
administratrix of the estate of Lawrence
McNally, deceased, made matters lively
for the lawyers. Lawrence's estate was
found to De worth considerable more than
$20,000, consisting of real and personal
property, for the most part in Humboldt
County. : . :
The court decided against Maria. Is
was held that the deceased had' never de-
Cared or acknowledged ; the alleged con
tract in any. definite manner. She ap
pealed and all she ; gained - was V another
decision, rendered . yesterday, to the same
effect as the first. ;

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1896.
WILL FIGHT THE
FUNDING BILL,
The Committee of Fifty
Renews Its Attack
With Vigor.
DEMANDS FORECLOSURE.
Henry E Highton to Prepare
an Address to the
Government.
ATTITUDE OF CANDIDATES.
Nominees for Congress Will Be Asked
for Their Indorsement of the
Popular Battle.
The citizens' committee of fifty on the
funding bill met in the office of Mayor
Sutro yesterday. Those present were the
Mayor, Heury E. Highton. James H.
Bany, J. M. Bassett, G. W. Monteith,
George K. Fitch, J. C. Jordan, W. M.
Coward, H, C. Hawkes, Joseph Leggett
and I. J. Truman. Mayor Sutro occupied
the chair.
The Mayor stated that the purpose of
the meeting was to discuss some mode of
procedure with the object of defeating the
funding bill. He digressed to discuss sil
ver, and in his talk on the subject saia :
"I'm in favor of free coinage, but am
absolutely opposed to 16 to 1. That would
be a public calamity. That is a matter
for legislationâ the people cannot regulate
it, while Congress can."
Henry E. Highton gave an outline of
what he proposed in the fight against the
bill. He would show that the law justified
foreclosure of the funding bill. The most
extreme difficulty the United States
Supreme Court could find itself in, he
add,ed, would be an effort to escape a law
so well denned and understood. He
thought that a committee should be estab
lished for the purpose of concentrating on
the funding Dill and of strengthening
public sentiment throughout the State.
There should also be a committee to at
tend to the Congressional nominees and
to Congress generally. "I would not vote
for the best man in the State," he added,
"if he were not pledged to fight this fund
ing bill."
Mr. Highton made a motion that a
memorial be prepared and submitted to
the President praying for foreclosure.
Bassett amended in the interest of
prompt and direct work, saying: "It is
best we should understand this tning now.
These corporations get their members of
Congress wherever they can rind them. It
makes bo matter what the political com
plexion of the man is. As an amendment
to Mr. High ton's motion I offer that Mr.
Highton be appointed a committee of one
to cite precedents and quote the law show
ing that the Government has the right to
foreclose the funding bill and present it in
the form of a brief or memorial to the law
department of the Government."
The amendment was seconded with en
thusiasm. Mr. Highton asked for time in
which to prepare the address, as he was
overworked and about to take a much
needed vacation. The amendment was
carried unanimously.
A motion was made by Highton that a
committee of five be appointed to see the
nominees for Congress throughout the
State and learn from them their attitude on
the funding bill, and assist only those who
favor foreclosure. The motion was carried.
James H. Barry. George K. Fitch, Joseph
Leggett, I. J. Truman and W. M. Coward
were selected.
Mr. Leggett asked if the idea was to op
pose any man who was not friendly to the
fight. He was told that the committee
could go to work and after the next meet
ing that question could be decided.
Monteith moved that a committee of
three be appointed to draft a petition
against refunding in any form and to sub
mit it to legislative candidates for their
signatures.
He suggested two propositions â one that
the signers are opposed to any and every
scheme of refunding, arid the other that
they demand the foreclosure of the debt
immediately.
"We can stand by the two propositions
made by Mr. Monteith till the erfcek of
doom," said Leggett. "We don't want to
appear as extremists. WHfct we shouia da
is to stand by what is just and right." He
seconded the motion.
Bassett's name was suggested to the
chair for this committee.
"Oix, no," exclaimed he, "that would
never do. lam a candidate for Congress
myself. But I believe that every candi
date should indorse this petition."
Monteith's motion was amended so that
he was appointed a committee of one to
prepare the petition.
This done the deliberations of the com
mittee changed to election matters.
The Mayor said he saw the bands of
Huntington and the "octopus" in local
affairs in the coming elections. "The fact
is that heretofore through their boss sys
tem they have absolutely run local
affairs,'- he sum. "We are all vitally in
terested in this as citizens. This wretched
precinct registrationâ there is where the
fault comes in. We should demand a fair
election, and I would like to have some
advice on this question. The fact is if tnis
precinct registration is not watched we
wiil be in the fame box as ever we were.
There are a lot of wandering vagabonds
who under different names register in dif
ferent precincts and thus defeat the ends
of a fair election."
Monteith said be believed that if a great
mass-meeting were held in the interest of
an honest election much good could be
done. What was badly needed was a watch
on the polls from the hour they open and a
watch on the ballots till they are locked
up in the Registrar's safe, lie held that
ii the committee of fifty would get the
peo pie together in a mass-meeting it could
undoubtedly secure an honest election
under the law.
Highton told how he had been twice at'
the Registrar's office to register, had spent
an hour and a half waiting, but could not
wait longer. He had written to Registrar
Hiutoti asking ii he would be disfranchised
through theincompetency of the office. In
this letter lie suggested an amendment to
the law that wouid entitle a man to vote
without registration before every election.
Only inlcaÂ»e of change of residence he sug
gested the necessity of registration.
Truman held quite a different opinion.
"Men chance their residences for the 'be
yond.' " he taid, "and their names are
voted."
He declared that considerable blame lay
at the door of the Registration Officeâ in
the incompetency of clerks who frequently
consumed fifteen minutes in registering
one voter.
No action was taken on the matter, and
the committee adjourned to the call of the
chair.

Pastor W. N.^Meserve â¢ led the meeting.'
He was particularly happy in his remarks.
Rev. Meserve announced that "â¢ he was so
temporally fortunate as not to be depend
ent on his salary as i pastor for support,
and at the quarterly meeting which fol
lowed he declared he would not accept a
cent of salary until after taxes and all
other bills ' against the : church were paid.
This announcement was received with
astonishment by the congregation, which,
however, is determined to see that their
pastor's experimental plan does not come
out on the wrong side of the ledger for
him. . : .
The report of the treasurer for the quar
ter ending July 15 showed total receipts of
$498 45 and total disbursements of $481 85.
The quarter closed with fl6 60 in the treas
ury. The liabilities of the church at the
present time were reported by 'â  the treas
urer to be $114 50 and the assets $116. .

Ghost Walked.
Charming and petite Hortense Nielsen,

on the Continent for histrionic talent, has

Her Debut in This City in August,
and Her Sister, Miss Alice Nielsen,
the Successful Grand Opera Singer
of the Tivoli.
passed through the trying ordeal of study â
the preparatory stageâ and will make her
debut on the real stage of footlights,
bouquets and fame August 19.
Miss Nielsen aspires to high comedy
roles, aud with good reason. Her work so
far in this line has called forth the most
flattering criticism. She has. In fact, been
compared even at this cany period of her
career to Julia Marlowe. There is marked
resemblance of face, ligure and action be
tween the two.
Miss Nielsen has the white skin and
golden hair of the Danish women. Her
father was a Dane and played Hamlet in
the country of Hamlet's birth. She is
vivaciouÃ and winsome and has a fine
voice.
She will be assisted by her sister, Alice
Nielsen, who has sung with so much suc
cess at the Tivoli and who has been en
gaged as prima donna for the Bostonians
during the coming season. Miss Nielsen
will also be supported by some of the best
talent of San Francisco, the debnt to be
Kiven either at the Auditorium or at the
Metropolitan Temple.
"I want the people of San Francisco to
kke me," said she yesterday. "I have
studied long and hard in this City, and I
want to make my start here. I stiall give
probably the balcony scene and the poison
scene from 'Romeo and Juliet.' I love
Shakespeare, and it is ray ambition to
play in some of his Comedies.
"I guess the love of the stage was born
in me. I recited at concerts when only a
little girl, and I intend"â she continued
emphasizing her statement whh a little
stamp of the fcot â "to succeed. After my
debut here I shall go East with my sister
and join some company there."
Miss Nielsen has had offers from two
good companies, but prefers to wait until
she can make her debut in San Francisco.
DEEDS OF HUMAN BRUTES
Cases of Cruelty To Horses Seem
to Be Greatly on the
Increase.
One of tbe Animals Is Lucky Enough
to Be Released From Misery
by a Pistol.
Cruelty to horses seems to be the fad of
the hour, the number of cases reported
yesterday at the office of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
being unusually large and of a peculiarly
aggravated type.
A fruit peddler known as Mike Blumen
thal, 26 years of age, has been driving an
animal fully as old as himself, which
might once have been a horse, but
which when seen yesterday looked more
like the ghost of a four-footed scarecrow.
The beast's letff fore foot and lee were hor
ribly swollen and were disfigured by sores.
Officer George Delmer took the unhappy
animal to a stable on Golden Gate avenue,
where a pistol shot soon ended its suffer
ings. It took the officer an hour and a
half to lead the suffering brute from the
corner of Sansonie ami Market streets,
where It was found, to the spot where a
merciful death relieved its misery.
Another case is that of a scavenger, who
refused to tell his name, giving in lieu
thereof the convenient pseudonym of John
Doe. This amiable individual has been
persistently driving a lame horse for some
time past. Repeated warnings having no
effect, the horse was yesterday taken in
charge and conveyed to the police stables
for treatment.
Third on the list is a man named East
wood, the keeper of a dairy on Victoria
street, near Broad. This man, who. would
seem to be of au economical turn of mind,
has been reported for turning out no less
than seven horses to starve after working
them nearly to death.
"There are more cases here," said Secre
tary Holbrook, indicating a pile of blanks
beside him, "but they're all alike. I
wonder if a revival of the old-time whip
ping post wouid help matters a little."
Stephen Wine's Kitate.
The will of Stephen Wing, who left property
valued at about $3000 bu been filed lor pro
bate. Isabella M. Wing, widow of the testator,
is named as executrix, without bonds. All the
estate except $2000, which is equally divided
between testator's mother and three sisters, is
left to Isabella M. Wine.

NOT YET A POLICEMAN.
Fred Lawrence Wants Thomas Calla-
nan Arrested for Getting 8250
From Him by Trickery.
Fred Lawrence, 514 Hayes street, ap
peared in Judge Low's court yesterday
and asked for a warrant for the arrest of
Thomas Callahan, an ex-policeman, on
the charge of grand larceny by trick and
device.
Lawrence paid that he was eaeer to be
come a member of the Police Department
and Callahan learned of it. Taev talked
the matter over and Callahan offered to
get his brother-in-law, Ea Lanigan, the
prominent politician, to u^e his influence
with the Police Commissioners on pay
ment of $250. Lawrence alleges that on
October 17 last year he gave Callahan
the money.
Lawrence is not vet wearing the blue
uniform with brass buttons, and says that
on making inquiry he found that Caliahan
and Lanigan had not been on speaking
terms for years.
Prosecuting Attorney Madden decided
to withhold issuing tbe warrant until he
made an investigation into the matter.
Callahan several months ago was ar
rested on complaint of Lanigan for failure
to support his wife and family. The case
was heard by Judge Conlan, and it was
shown that Callahan haa been spending
his earnings on other women, leaving his
wife and family to be supported by Lani
san. Callaban agreed to contribute to
tbeir support and the case was dismissed.
Lanigan beard on several occasions that
Callahan had been using his name without
authority and reported the matter to the
police. He says he would gladly see Cal
lahan in the penitentiary, and will assist
in his prosecution.
An Old-Horse Sale.
The regular quarterly sale of unclaimed
property was held at the Appraisers' building
on Washington street Wednesday. The articles
offered by the auctioneer varied from a case ot
temperance pamphlets to a dozen quart

uation of $70. but tbe hone price was fixed at

KUNG CHOW'S STATEMENT
Denies That He Is Responsible
for the Murder of Lee
Ti.
Ex-Consul-General Lee Yung Yen
Ignorant as to the Cause of
the Troub c.
Lee Ti, a Chinese clam-dealer, was mur
dered wcile standing in the doorway of 35
Waverly place a few days ago. The fol
lowing morning Ock Wah, a highbinder
whose hands are crimson with the gore of
many victims, was arrested on suspicion
of being the assassin and charged with the
crime. That Lee Ti is dead and Ock Wah
is behind prison bars are undisputed facts,
but the causes which led up to the cowardly
murder remain unknown.
Various theories regarding the causes of
the assassination have been advanced by
the police, but it is evident that ail have
been erroneous. There is without doubt a
woman in the case, but how or why a re
ward of $1000 has oeen offered for the lives
of Joe Gar and Lee Mcc Toy remains un
explained.
As was first presumed, the trouble over
the appointment of a Wooey Leong man,
by the twelve directors of the Kung Chow
Association, has no connection whatever
with the murder. That appointment was
a trivial affair.
The directors of the Knng Chow Associa
tion emphatically deny that the trouble in
their association was in any way responsi
ble for the murder of Lee Ti.
The trouble in the ranks of the Kung
Chow Association originated in the deata
of Chin Look, a Wooey Loeng man.
Yuner Hing, the Chinese Consul, notified
the Kung Chow Association that the
vacancy must be filled.
The twelve directors of that company
intended to select a man and then notify
the Consul as to the man appointed, that
he might approve of their selection. At
this period, however, the directors of the
Kung Chow aver Lee Mcc Toy and Joe
Oar, then members of the association, ob
jected to the society's selection and
named Leong Sam as a capable man to
fill the vacant position.
They wanted the directors to appoint
Leong Sam without conferring with the
Consul, but the directors heeded not their
wishes. About ten days ago during an ar
gument over the appointment Lee Gong
made a verbal assault on Lee Lun Yuen,
president of the Kung Chow Association.
Lee Yip Dock immediately defended the
president and a hot wordy war followed.
A few days later Lee Gong met Lee Yip
Dock on the street and assaulted him, the
former being arrested on a charge of as
sault. Lee Mcc Toy and Joe Gar then
signed bonds for the release of Lee Gong
and retained counsel to defend him. This
angered the directors of the Kane Chow
Association, and tne two agitators were
I expelled from its ranks. A few days later
the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent As
| sociation took action oa the matter, and
also expelled Joe Gar and Lee Mcc Toy.
The two derelict merchants then con
cluded to fasten the various troubles which
have been exciting Chinatown during the
last few months at the door of the Kung
Chow Association, but without success.
The Kung Chow has been in existence
over forty years, and has been active in
suppressing all lawlessness, and has never
once been suspected of instigating feuds
or dissatisfaction among the various tongs.
Consequently it is evident that it was in
no way connected with the crime now
only a few ua?s old.
Lee Yung Yen, ex-Consul-General, was
greatly surprised to hear that his name
had been mentioned in connection with
the present trouble. "Not since 1 turned
the office over to my successor, which is
now over eight months ago," said the ex-
Consul-General last evening, "have I in
terested myself in Chinese affairs.
"I am acquainted with Lee Yip Dock.but
I am at a loss to understand how my
name came to be mentioned in the affairs
of the Kung Chow Association. I under
stand mat thera is wme little trouble
going on in that association, but as to the
nature of it I am entirely ignorant."

FKUIT DEVELOPMENT.
The Condition of the Crop Worse Than
Expected.
Thecircnlarof the Cutting Packing Company
gives an unfavorable exhibit of the frnlt crop, as
foi.ows:
CANNED FRUITSâ Apricots â There has
been a great change ln the qua'lty of the prospec
tive crop for tbe worse since our last, although we
we-it on record then to the effect that the crop was
badly deteriorating. We do not know of a season
v ;..ii tlie quality has become so poor as a general
proposition. The extreme heat has produced a
jrrei.t proportion of cracked fruits and sour pus,
while the extreme cold weather noted all through
the spring caused an equally large proportaon of
scrubby, scaly and smutty fruit, consequently good
canning stock has been growing scarcer up to
about a week atro. when the unprecedented hot
spell had an even more serious effect.
The crop as a whole would have been equal to
that of 1895 had it not been for the above unfavor
able conditlous, but as it is, fully one-half of those
engaged for canning are being rejected and turned
into the drys-ards. It Is probable that a great
many orders, especially for extras and high-grade
standards, will fall short of being filled, and as
there is still a carry-over of poor standards and
seconds, packers will not care to increase their
stock of such, and the pack as a whole will doubt
less not exceed eO per cent of that of 1895, and in
spite of all precautions and attempts to the con
trary, a large percentage of It will be of low grade.
As a whole this will result in ordinary standards
and seconds beingoffered at very low figures, while
the high-grade standards and extras will command
hich prices.
I'kachesâ Hot weather has caused a considera
ble drop on the Sacramento River, where frees are
short and quality much poorer than expected, on
account of premature ripeninz, the beat prevent- j
mc tlie growth to full sue. Frees, however, will j
be much more plentiful in other localises, ai.d the |
out-turn, as a whole, larger than iv 1895. Clings [
are not turning out well at all, being more visibly j
aftected by the heat even man the frees, and ihey '
are dropping considerably. As a whole the crop i
will not be of good quality, and though plentiful in !
quantity- there will be the same difficulty in secur
ing good canning stock as nith apricots.
Pkaksâ The crop is a disappointment as to qual
ity, although tbe quantity is large except in the
extieuie nonh, the same trouble affecting quality
as peaches and apricots, truit running small with
much scab and scale: good stock is commanding a
hiith price and will not be overplentiful, while low
crades as to size and smoothness will go begging
at bu yer's price
iM.i'Ms-i rop is maturing very short in quantity, i
as previously advised, and there is no improve
ment worth noting: quality, however, will be
qnit>" tip to the average.
small Fbcitsâ Previous advices as to quantity
and quality are confirmed; trade is light, it may 1
be fairly said that the crop as a whole throughout
the State is of poor quality, and that a great deal |
of trouble will be experienced by canners In get
ting sufficient stock for high standards and extras.
On the other band, canners who are accustomed
to make a lar*e puck will be tempted to avail
themselves 01 the low prices ruling for "off" stock I
and possibly make a larger pack than they other- !
wise would, wi h the almost certain resu t that {
the market will be flooded with a surplus of unde- j
sirable quality. ! his appears to have been the re- .
suit on apricots to date, and may be followed on ;
tne other varieties. Cherries are doubtless the I
only variety that will be actually short, and the
present unsold stock will command good prices, i
C'oi.siaerinc tbe political situation and condition of â 
National finances and the uncertainty attending I
boibas to future values of merchandise throunh- I
out the country, we can hardly s>e how canners !
are justified in stocking up above their actual .
wan s, based on very conservative methods; but 1
we presume there will be the usual output, with
the invaiiaole result.
Ti'Matoksâ No change whatever either in the
market, values of the light stock on hand or in
puckers' ideas of prices for futures: in fact ti.ere
is mo trade worth considering for either spot stock
or fuTurcs.
IiRIED FRUlTSâ Apbicotsâ Have been going
forward .-lowly at gradually reduced prices, ihe
output whl be about 350 cars, which is consider

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It. If any, tbe amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredttis,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
line*, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted linÂ»-s, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accomDunied by fair weather: "low"
rt-fers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompunied by cloudy weather and rams.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Whfn ihe pressure is high ln the Interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of <>rtÂ«von Is improb
able With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather mny be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition!
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK, N. V.. July 23.â The stock market
to-day was influenced by the deposits of gold at
the I sab-treasury, the â  reduction in exchange and
to an extent by the advices from St. Louis regard
ing the convention of the Populists. | At the open-
Ing and closing the market was lather weak, bat
in the Interim it displayed a great deal of strength.
The opening was disappointing, owing to the re
ceipt of lower cable* from London, It having been
â¢-xpected that the foreigners would buy our stocks
in view of tbe efforts 'making to keep the Govern
ment on a gold basis. The contrary proved true,
and In fart London houses took advantage or the
high prices to turn their paper profit* Into cash.
The early decline was . equal to 1 per cent in
Sugar and about 14Â®% per cent In the general run
of active issues. In the ' afternoon trading ' the
heavy deposits of gold by the banks, which re
sulted in the restoration of the treasury gold re
serve to $100,000,000, and reports from St. Louis
that the Populists would not indorse ' Bryan after
all, started up a lively baying on the part of the
shorts, a rise of i,4@3% per cent followed. Jersey
Central, the Grangers and Industrials led tbe up
ward movement, and the trading in these Issues
were animated. .
- The bulk of the buying was for the short account,
although commission houses took moderate
amounts of the dividend payers, presumably for
Investment. In the late trading there were realisa
tions, and the big bears renewed their attacks. A
decline of i/i@l 4 per cent followed in the general
list while .Manhattan dropped to 93% c, a loss of
2*4 per cent. This stock was heavy throughout
the day. Ibe selling by the bear contingent near
the close was due to information from St. Louis
that the friends of Bryan baa captured the con
vention and that he would be either nominated or
indorsed. Specula' ion closed steady.
Net changes show losses of *AÂ® 3 A percent out
| side of Manhattan, which declined 2% percent.

CHICAGO Â»IAKKJÂ£TS.
CHICAGO, lix.. July 23.â The wheat market
to-day was stronger, the reasons for which were
found in the weather conditions, higher cables,
lighter receipts both here and at the Northwest, a
steady stock market and alack of offerings in
response to a demand for No. 2 red winter wheat.
The Cincinnati Price Current's resume was not
decisive one way or the other, alt hough a trifle
bullish. if anything. TUe weather predicions of
continued rains in the Northwest and the South
west ' may be named as â  the principal bull news.
St. Louis was very strong at prices much below
those at Chicago.'. â  . . â -. Â . .-..
Receipts at Minneapolis and Duluth were 21Â«
cars, against 282 last Thursday and 160 on Thurs
day of the same week - a year ago. . Chicago re
ceived 129 cars, of which ; IÂ»'4 were new, and took
from store 41,602 . bushels.' . Liverpool was stead.
to i/4d higher. â  Atlantic seaboard, clearances tor
24 hours were 304,080 busnels. Continental cables
were generally lower. The market at the close was
activ and strong. â  September wheat opened at
67c to 56%@57c. sold between 68% c and 5bV/ g @
68c, closing at 58@58y B e. %c higher than yester
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 11*9 cars.
- CORN â Was firmer, following the strength in
wheat, but the Price, Current's statement of crop
conditions was a little bearish, in that an Improve
ment was noted. Receipts were 366 cars, against
ihe estimate of ' 270. -Withdrawals : were heavy,
273,^b2 .bushels. - Liverpool cables were ready
and unchanged. .. Export clearances were 171,691
bushels. September corn opened, at 26V4C. soM
between 265/ 8 and 2tSV4C. closing at 2G%c, s/g@
%cr higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 432 cars. * , Â â¢.. â  .
OAT^-Also were firm because of light receipts,
fair buying orders aM ' the Price Current's report
that the crop was 'unsatisfactory in quality, and
further ltid cations of â â  rust and wet weather. - Re
ceipts were 202 cars. There were no withdrawals
from store. September closed s/ higher. Esti
mated receipts for to-marrow. 267 cars.

WOOLâ A local circular says: "Since 1893 there
has not been so|wretched a state of affairs in Wool
matters as we now have, and as has existed, and
been brought about by the action of the Chicago
convention After the nomination of MoKlnle v
the Wool industries of the country seemed to be
shaping toward activity for woolen goods, and con
sequently Improved 'prices for raw material, but
this outlook only lasted until the Chicago conven
tion enuncla ed its . platform, . which : for the time
being lias stopped ' all Inclination on | the part of
manufacturers and dealers to do business. â  The re
sult Is we have large stocks .of Wool and no Urge
buyers, - and telegrams of late date \ from Boston
state that the Wool bouses I are not doing enough
business to pay clerk hire, and the greater number
of them decline to receive > Wool on consignment,
more especially it any money advances are re^
qu red. A month ago northern Wools were bought,
at Cklah and Cloverdale at ll@U%c. ; To-day
these Wools could not be sold freely here at 10c.
A month ago we expected to get at least 12c for
choicest Humboldt Wools, to-day we could not set
buyers tor them at 10c In any large quantity, and
the outlook Is so unsatisfactory that it is bard to

IS ON THEM,
Supervisors Declare They
Only Did What They
Were Told.
AN APOLOGY ISSUED.
They Toss the Ball of Responsi
bility to the District
Attorney's Oifice.
SNOOK FOLLOWED MOREHOUSE,
Mr. Morehouse Ordered Nothing, hut
Simply Gave the Benefit of
His Advice.
Oakland Office San FÂ«anci6co Call,)
908 Broadway, July 23. )
There is consternation in the county
building. The ball of responsibility is
being tossed from the District Attorney's
office to the Supervisors' quarters and
thence to the members of the State
Board of Equalization from San Leandro.
To-day the Supervisors issued their
"justification." They ordered the County
Clerk to compile a tabulated statement of
the assessment roll that would show
exactly what they did, what Mr. More
house ordered them to do, what District
Attorney Snook advised them to do, and
what Mr. Black Ryan's arguments per
suaded them to do.
The assessment roll was cut $2,500,000,
and somehow or other the Southern Pa
cific Company experienced the benefit of
half of the entire cut, and now the friends
of the Assessor are attempting to find out
who did it.
Mr. Morehonse disclaims the responsi
bility of it. When before the Supervisors,
he informed Mr. Dalton he was not there
to interpret law, but to inform tbe board
how the State Board accounted for the
100 miles of track in this county that the
Assessor claims is totally ignored by tbe
State Board. Mr. Morehouse did not order
the Supervisors to reduce the assessment,
but he, in conjunction with E. Black
Ryan, so worked upon their sympathy for
the big corporation that they reduced
property assessed at $914,700 to $35.
The justification of their action, pub
lished by the Supervisors this afternoon,
is a very interesting document. The
reduction on the Seventh-street local and
Berkeley lines and long wharf aite from
neatly a million to nothing, is "justified"
by the remark: "Reduced on advice of
District Attorney because assessed by
State Board of Equalization." As Mr.
Snook was fishing in another county when
Mr. Morehouse "explained" to Mr. Dalton
and tbe Supervisors how he accounted for
the last road, and as there was no report
made of the proceedings, Mr. Dalton can
not understand how Mr. Snook could so
readily render an opinion.
The reduction of the water company's
franchise from $230,000 to $12,500 is
"justified" by the remark: "Reduction
made on advice of District Attorney that
franchises were not assessable in Alameda
County."
The sum of $419,650 which was assessed
to the national banks and their officials is
marked "exempt," and the following
"justification" is printed: "Items given
as 'exempt,' reduced to nominal figure,
owing to advice of District Attorney that
same were not subject to assessment."
For a benediction the statement says:
"Total of assessments affected by legal
questions and reduced or stricken from
the roll on advice of the District Attorney,
$955,338."
The District Attorney will not shoulder
the responsibility. He says that there
was no other course open to him. The
chairman of the State Board said that the
missing road was assessed somehow, but
although no one understood the method
Mr. Snook say a he could not legally au
thorize a double assessment. Just why he
should advise against the assessment of
the banks after the Attorney-General bad
advised Mr. Dalton to assess them is not
mentioned. Under the circumstances the
Assessor says tbat Mr. Snook should have
let the assessment stand and allowed tbe
banks to carry their fight to the Supreme
Court.
And while each of the three elements is
trying to hide behind the other two
Supervisor Peiouz, who voted against
the Solid Four throughout, is indulging in
a hearty laugh with Assessor Dalton over
his brethren's discomfiture.
NO CRIME TO LOVE.
Nor Yet Sinful to Beat the Man
Who Takes Your Wife
Walking.
OAKLAND. Cal., July 23.â George Jor
dan learned last night that it is not a
crime for a man to love a woman even if
she be somebody cisc's wife.
George Jordan is a regular attendant at
lodge meetings. Last night he did not
feel inclined to go and so told his wife.
She was very much surprised and urged
him so strongly to attend to his fraternal
duties that he doubted the cause of her
persistency.
Finally he decided to go. He did not
proceed to his lodge, but stayed in the
darkness near his home and waited de
velopments. A little later his wife came
out. After walking a few Bteps she was
joined by a young man and they started
for a walk.
Before going far Jo rdan decided to take
b hand. He took two hands, and while be
held his wife with one lie rained blows on
the other man's herd with the other.
Policeman Reinhardt was summoned by
Jordan, who asKed him to arrest his wife's
companion, a barber named Henry Der
win. The officer refused, as Derwin had
committed no crime. Derwin admitted
his mistake to-day, and Jordan said if he
cannot get satisfaction under criminal
law he will resort to the Civil Code.
Au Automatic Gate.
OAKLAND Cal., July 23.â The Btreet
Department is at work placing an auto
matic flush gate in tbe main lake sewer.
By this means a utrearn of water will
be kept running through the sewer all
of the time except at high tide, when the
gate will close to keep the teweage from
being backed into the lake. This auto
matic flushing of the sewer is expected to
keep it from becoming clogged as at pres
ent with sand bars and wili save a man's
time who formerly had to open and close
a gate by hand every time it was thought
Xjecessary to flush the sewer.
A Caved-In Sewer.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â Street
Superintendent Miller is occupied making
repairs upon the Union-street sewer be
tween Twenty-second and Twenty-fourth
streets, which has caved in. At this point
the sewer runs very close to the top of the
ground and it is thought that a heavily
loaded wagon has caused tbe trouble.
ARDENT SUFFRAGISTS.
Silts ft, B. Anthony Greatly Encour
aged by the Feeling Among
the Salvationists.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â Miss Susan
B. Anthony addressed the Salvation Army
camp-meeting at Trestle Glen this after
noon. There was a larger attendance than
on any afternoon Bince the camp opened.
Miss Anthony seemed to striKe a sym
pathetic chord in her audience from tbe
start. The Salvation Army, explained
Brigadier Kepoel, is a suffrage movement
par excellence. It was probably the first
great organization to entirely eradicate
sex lines and to conter distinction equally
on men and women.
The position of women in the army was
generously praised by Miss Anthony, and
she encouraged her sisters to go ahead and
stop at nothing short of the ballot. The
speaker told of the progress and success of
the movement in various parts of the
State and predicted emancipation for her
sex in November.
Rev. Eliza Tupper-Wilkes also made a
short address and her remarks were very
wiity. She kept her audience smiling all
the time. _
This evening Commissioner BoOuh-
Tucker arrived on the camp ground and
conducted the latter part of the meetine.
He will be present at all meetings till the
close.
School Days to Begin.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â J. B. Mc-
Chesney, principal of the High School,
will be at his office in the school building
Saturday from 9 a. m. to 3 p. m. to consult
with pupils and parents.
The pupils who formerly took the com
mercial course in tbe High School are re
quested to report at the Central Grammar
School, in tbe old High School building,
on Monday. This change will lessen the
attendance somewhat at the new build
ing. Ail of the public schools open Mon
day for the fall term.
Objects to a Stepfather.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â Jennie Gib
son, a pretty miss of 15, has left her home
in San Francisco and will hereafter live in
Oakland, just because ber mother has
married a second husband. Miss Jennie
has heard so much of stepfathers that she
does not like the idea of having one her
self. To-day Mrs. Prescott was appointed
ber guardian by the court, with the
mother's consent. The mother was in
court at the time.
DEATH OF AN OLD-TIMER
The Old Secretary of the Famous
Ophir Mine Closes His
Books Forever.
H. D. Clark Breaks His Collar-Bone.
A Demand for Legal Services
Made Upon the City.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. July 23.â George
Voges, who for the past ten years has been
known as the proprietor of the Central
Gardens, at the corner of Grand street and
Railroad avenue, died this morning. His
death is attributed to heart disease and
diabetes. The deceased was 56 years old
and was a native of Hanover, Germany.
Voges was a man who had bad a varied
and interesting career. In his young days
he was a gay Thespian and took tbe boards
in bis native country and his adopted
home. He came to California after the
war. and was for many years secretary and
accountant for the famous Opbir mine.
Stock speculations ruined him and then
he became a popular boniface, well known
to business men on California, Sutter and
Kearny streets, San Francisco.
111-bealth hampered him in his business
ventures and he came to Alameda, making
the Central Gardens a popular resort.
The funeral services are set for Saturday
at 2 p. m.
A Broken Collarbone.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 23.â Herbert D.
Clark, contributor to a local paper, broke
his collarbone last night in the Alameda
Cyclers' Club, of which he is a member.
He and another club member were
wrestling, and Clark was thrown, landing
heavily on his left side and breaking his
collarbone.
Associate Counsel's Fee.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 23.â Marcus P.
Wiggin has made a demand upon the city
for Jegal services in the case of J. T.
Fleming vs. the City Trustees, in assisting
tbe City Attorney in defense of that
action. Mr. Wiegin considers his services
to be worth $150, and he has been par
ticularly careful to cross out tbe words,
printed on all city demands, that "the
prices charged are the current market
rates."
The Red Cross Ordinance.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 23.â The health
ordinance referring to expectorating in
public places and conveyances has been
posted in placard form all over the city.
On the center of the placard is printed a
large red Geneva cross, which has caused
the ordinance to be known as the Red
Cross ordinance. It is finding great favor
in the eyes of restaurant-keepers and
ladies who travel. Tney say that it is
breaking tbe bad habit of spitting any
where and everywhere which some men
have.
Alameda Day.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 23.â The Ala
meda-day programme committee met this
morning and organized, with T. G. Dan
iells as chairman and J. A. Munro secre
tary. Joseph F. Forderer has been chosen
president of the day and E. K. Taylor and
Green Majors the orators.
Street-Sprinklers' Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.âSuperin
tendent of Streets Miller wants the wages
of tne street-sprinklers graded according
to the work done. From reports turned
into the office he finds that some drivers
of sprinKlera' carts cover thirteen miles,
while others only cover six miles. Not
withstanding the difference of work done
they are all paid $4 a day.
He lines that the best results are made
by men who have the latest improved
carts and good teams. The character of
the drivers cut quite a figure, and Mr.
Miller thinks that a graded scale of wages
will be an incentive to better work.
CHEERED FOR M'KINLEY.
A Roaftlng Meeting by the Army and
Navy Republican League.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â The Army
and Navy Republican League held a rous
iOK meeting to-night, which was attended

icy of Buchanan compared favorably with
that of Cleveland. The evening's enter
tainment concluded with pork and beans,
hardtack, coffee and tobacco.
Paderewski once thought of studying
the violin, but the teacher to whom he ap
plied told htm he could never become a
musician.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1896.
THINK THEY SEE
A LITTLE JOKER
Radical Change in the
Rules of the Hay
wards Road.
VIEW OF THE SECRETARY
It Will Increase Salaries but
Save Money for the Rail
road Company.
BUT THE MEN ABE ANXIOUS.
Although the Rules B; Obeyed, the
Old Emyloyes May All Be
Let Out.
Oakland Office, Sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 23. f
A new system of conducting the Hay
wards electric road was inaugurated to
day. It was reported that tbe men were
intending to strike, but such is not the
case. The situation is of great interest to
all carmen and will be carefully watched.
"There was one clause which the men
did not see," said A. L. Stone, secretary of
the road, to-day. 'It says that the new
schedule shall not affect any of the present
employes of the road.
"Our new plan is a distinct benefit to the
men whom we shali henceforth employ
and does not affect the men who work for
as at present. From this time ou we shall
pay 19 cents per hour for tbe first two
years' service, 20 cents for the third year,
21 cents the fourth year and '11 cento for
all who work for five years or upward.
The only effect it will have on the men at
present employed is that five years from
now their salary will be increased 1 per
cent per year. At present all men receive
21 cents an hour.
"Now here is where the men will receive
a benefit. At present we have motormen
and conductors, but in the future we shall
break men in from both ends. That is,
they will be fitted for either a motorman
or a conductor, and this will give tuem,
more hours of work. At present two men
are broken in where one will do in the
future, and this will be a retrenchment for
the company, as there will not be so many
men on its payroll, but those that are kept
on will receive more salary. As a matter
of fact, the change is really a benefit to
the men."
The employes of the road are discussing
the matter, and while they admit the
truth of all tbat the secretary says they
feel somewhat uneasy, as they are not
sure how soon it may affect them.
"This is our position," said one of the
men this evening. "If the company likes
it can soon bring about a big reduction iv
salary, even while it is faithfully obeying
its new rules. Suppose it should drop all
of its old men, one or two at a time, and
take on new ones. Then the new men
would recei7e 19 cents for two years. If
the company should decide not to retain
any one in its employ for more than two
years it would never pay more than 19
cents, although it could be obeying the
letter of the new rule, but ignoring its
spirit.
''We do not suppose that the company
intends to make any such radical changes,
but the loophole is there if they wish to
take advantage of it, and that is what
makes us feel uneasy."
Regarding a strike, a very interesting
condition of affairs prevails on the Hay
wards road. Each car is marked "U. 8.
Mail," and the company has a contract
to carry mails daily. Under the decision
of the Federal courts employes cannot re
fuse to move the mails, so that if the
postmaster placed a mail bag aboard each
car the employes would either have to
work or go to jail; that is, if former deci
sions should be allowed to stand Should
any disagreement arise the point would
take on a very interesting phase.
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
A Drowned Man Found With a Bottle
of Whisky in His
Pocket.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â The body of
an unknown man, about 45 or 50 years old,
5 feet 9 inches tall, with a reddish-gray
beard and mustache, was found in tbe
estuary last night by Nels Lunde, an em
ploye at Hay & Wright's shipyard. He
made it fast to the bank and notified the
Coroner this morning.
There was a Waterbury watch in the
dead man's pocket, 30 cents and a bottle
of whisky. Tne watch had stopped at 25
minutes of 7 o'clock. The body had the
appearance of having been in the water a
day or so.
Died Before Aid Arrived.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â The death
of Miss Clara C. Deitman of Sixteenth
avenue at a late hour last night was caused
from general debility. At an autopsy held
this afternoon Dr. Wilcox found that sev
eral internal organs were affected, but she
had insisted on doing the housework and
no one realized that s>he was in such poor
health.
Miss Deitman was 31 years old and had
just joined her sisters here. When she
was taken suddenly ill yesterday after
noon the doctor was sent for, but she died
before he arrived.

HAVE NOT BEEN BARRED,
The L. A. W. Has Not Refused
to Recognize Colored
Clubs.
Oaklakd Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 23. j
Harry F. Williams, captain of the Oak
land Cycling Club, has been considerably
amused by the publication of -the report
that his club has been refused admission
to the League of American Wheelmen.
No such letter has been received, and
tbe matter is still being considered by the
L. A. W.
â¢'I think the story must have been cir
culated for tbe purpose of creating preju
dice against us," said Captain Williams
to-day. "I wrote to the league last year,
and was told that the matter had never
been brought up, and that we should hear
later. 1 wrote again a few days ago and
have not yet received a reply.
"The story that I have been informed
that we could not be admitted and that I
had severely criticized the league man
agers is entirely false. I am still waiting
for my answer, and have every reason to
believe that it will be favorable to us. If
it does not admit our clubs to full mem
bership it may recognize our meets and
keep our records. v
"We did feel that the pubHcation did us
an injustice, as Chairman Welsh is con
sidering the matter and we have certainly
said nothing."
NO PRIZE-FIGHTING .
rhe Chief of Tolice See* No Good in
Physical Culture Exhi
bitions.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 23.â Patrons of
physical culture do not rind favor in the
eyes of Chief of Polic Lloyd. When told
that the athletic clubs are trying to secure
a prize-tight to take place in this city he
said:
They can't come here. I do not propose to
allow a State law to be violated in this city.
The granting of a permit for a Drire-fight,
under the pretense that it is a "physical cul
ture" exhibition, is a mere farce. The legisla
tive body or a ciiy has no power to set aside a
State law. I witnessed one of the exhibitions
across the bay, and I can say it was a prize
fight pure and simple. Such affairs cannot be
given here If I have anything to say about it.
CUNNINHGHAM SHORT
IN HIS ACCOUNTS,
University of California
Out Several Hundred
Dollars.
VETERINARY FINANCES.
The Accused Man Was Formerly
Secretary of the New
School.
MADE MANY FAIR PROMISES,
Treasurer Egen Swears to a Com
plaint Charging Misdemeanor
Embezzlement.
There is intense excitement among the
faculty and students of the veterinary de
partment, University of California, over
an alleged shortage of the former secre
tary, Professor J. Auchiie Cunningham.
Yesterday the affair reached a climax,
when Dr. 'Egan, treasurer of the veter
inary school, swore to a complaint in
Judge Conlan's court charging Cunning-
ham with misdemeanor embezzlement.
The former secretary is directly accused
of making way with the sum of $22, but
the actual shortage is said to be anywhere
from $190 to $500.
The trouble is one of long standing, but
did not reach an earlier head because ot
the leniency of several members of the
faculty. The veterinary department of the
University of California was organized
about two years ago, by the present fac
ulty, it being necessary at the time tor
each member to put up something like $50
in order to make ttie institution a financial
success. Dr. Bteers was the first secretary,
and at the end of twelve months was suc
ceeded by Professor Cunningham. For a
time everything moved along smoothly,
and then suddenly a dark spot appeared
on the secretary's record.
On November 22, 1895, Cunningham was
given a check for $68 60 with which to pay
Bundry bills, including one of $22 from H.
8. Crocker & Co., printers. A few weeks
after this a second bill came from
tne printing firm and the secretary
was called on for an explanation. He as
sured the faculty that the matter had
escaped his attention, but that he would
attend to it at once. Two months after
this a third dun came from Crocker <fc Co.,
and this time Cunningham said he had
paid it and consequently there was a mis
take somewhere.
In the meantime other matters of an
unpleasant character came to the surface,
and last May when the annual election of
officers occurred, Cunningham was dis
placed and Dr. Steers elected in his 6tead.
A few days later it was discovered thai
the erstwhile secretary was about $350
behind in his accounts. The matter was
called to his attention and he promised to
right things in a few days. It seems that
he did eventually pay $160 and then en
deavored to offset matters by presenting a
bill against the college.
Cunningham claimed among other
things that he had entertained the stud
ents at various times at his house, the gas
bill and breakage of instruments alone
amounting to about $50, He was informed
by the faculty that if he would produce
the bills for the amount claimed the same
would be placed to his credit. The bills
were not forthcoming and the indebted
ness was coDseauently not decreased.
Then Cunningham made numerous
promises to liquidate, but somehow failed
to do so. Finally the faculty grew tired
of waiting, and yesterday Dr. Egan, as
its representative, swore to the complaint
above referred to. Cunningham's known
shortage, including the Crocker bili, is
$212, but it is thought by some members
of the faculty that there may be other
bills unpaid, which will make this amount
$500 or more.
Dr. Egan declined to talk about the af
fair last night, though he admitted tnat
the facts recited auove are correct. He
said, however, tbat be had sworn to the
complaint first because the faculty had re
quested it, and second the institution be
ing still in its infancy could ill afford to
sustain such a loss as was contemplated in
the shortage of ex-Secretary Cunningham.
A THIEVING CARPENTER.
Frank Meado Sent to the County Jail
for Four Months.
Frank Meade, a carpenter, was sent to
the County Jail for four months by Judge
Joacbimsen yesterday on the charge of
petty larceny.
For over a year numerous petty thefts of
tools and other material were committed
at the Farrott building on Market street
and all efforts to detect the thief were
futile. The case was pnt into the hands of
a private detective agency and Meade was
arrested Wednesday afternoon. He had
sold a number of incandescent light globes
which he had stolen from the building to
a man named Baker on Mission street for
50 cents per dozen, the cost price being
35 cents each.
CLOSE OF VACATION
NEAR AT HAND,
Berkeley Freshmen Have
Already Begun to
Arrive.
SCHEDULE OF EXERCISES
The University Will Open
Two Weeks From
Monday.
500 FRESHMEN EXPECTED.
Buildings and Campus Being Put Into
Condition for the Fall
Opening.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 23.â Vacation
at the State University is rapidly drawing
to a close. Two weeks from next Monday
the wheels of the State's highest institu
tion of learning will again begin to re
volve. Three weeKs from to-day, the 13th
of August, will be registration day, when
graduates and upper class students will be
expected to hie their schedules of courses
for the fall term. Already new students
have begun to appear on tne campus and
ask for the recorder's office. Many fam
ilies from the interior of the State have
arrived within the last few days and are
taking up their residences in the college
town. The professors have begun to re
turn to Berkeley from their summer out
ings, and the buildings and grounds are
being put into condition for the reception
of students.
From all appearances it would seem
that the class of freshmen this year will
exceed 500. If the number is swelled to
tnat mark the faculty will again be con
fronted with the question as to where they
all shall be accommodated.
The new Mechanics' building ha 3 been
put into service as headquarters for several
of the departments which were formerly
in the other buildings. Lieutenant Winn,
head of the military department, who is
probably the most visited man in the
faculty, has moved his offa'ce to the
Mechanics' building, a distance of about
300 yards from ><orth Hall, the head
quarters of the student body.
This change has already aroused consid
erable displeasure on the part of the stu
dent cadets who are about Berkeley, be
cause of the distance of the office from the
armory and recitation ball. Some talk
has been made of moving the recorder's
office to the mechanics' building also.
Librarian Rowell has just received a
large invoice of English books on science,
art and literature, which he says will be a
valuable addition to the library.
Following is the schedule of exercises
for the opening of tho term, as prepared
by the president:

GAS PROPERTIES PAY WELL.
Electricity Giving "Way to a More Eco-
inimical Light.
D. J. McCool, a representative of the
United Gas Improvement Company of
Philadelphia, which owns gas plants in
thirty-eight American cities, arrived here
last night from the East.
He says that electricity as a rival of teas
is not nearly so dangerous as it was about
twelve years ago. At that time the elec
tric light began rapidly to supplant tne
pas litiht. But since the introduction and
perfection of improved gasburners that
regulate and economize the supply there
has been a constant return of old patrons
to gas.
These new burners require only three
cubic feet an hour, where eight and nine
feet were used before their introduction.
With them a sixty-candle power light can
be attained at a cost much less than that
for a sixteen-candle power electric light.
Consequently people are going back to the
more economical light.
t Mr. McCool declares that he considers
gas properties safe investments. He adds
that not over 30 per cent of the electric
light plants in the United States are pay
ing dividends.
THE WISDOM OF
THE CURBSTONE.
What the Small Street
Orators Say About
Silver.
A HOT DISCUSSION.
What Held the Crowd After
the Bulletins Stopped
Coming.
PROTECTION AND PROSPERTY.
It Paid the War Dsbt and Put a
Value ou Every Man's
Property.
"Good-nieht."
The eager crowd in front of The Call
bulletin saw the words written at the end
of the story of the convention proceedings
in Chicago, which all afternoon and the
early hours of the night had been written
there in brief paragraphs. The orators
that had been dividing the interest with
the man on tbe trestle with his marking
pot all these hours now had it all their own
way.
Tbat part of the crowd who did not care
for them broke away, but their places
were quickly filled by others who did care
more for the heated argument than for the
news from St. Louis, and who wanted to
nelp heat the argument.
"They'll be out of the road altogether
and safely landed in the Democratic camp
by this time to-morrow night," said one of
these, by way of inciting to rebellion.
"Sixteen to one they do nothing of the
kind," said the man in the center of the
crowd, whose soft, white hat distinguishe d
him.
There was a surge to and fro for a
mir.ute and the debate was under full
swing.
"The Populist party is the party of the
people," said the man with the white hat.
'The people want money, more money,
and they can't get any oat of either of the
old parties, and they're going to stick in
the middle of the road until they get it."
"Where does the road lead? asked a
thin man with a thin voice from the outer
edge of the crowd.
"To the White House, of course. It
leads to a place where the fiat of the Gov
ernment makes as good money as there is
in the world."
"Can we buy English hops with it?"
"Not an English hop â we don't need
'em. We have hops to sell, and better
beer, too, than they can make in London."
A man with a long, white beard, who
was, nevertheless, not a Populist, but a
goldbug of the most pronounced character,
edged his way through tbe crowd until he
stood face to face with the man with the
white hat, and raising his band full of
silver half-dollars cried :
"Here's the money you want. Will you
trade me a hver in gold for it â I've got
more silver than I want?"
â¢Nobody else in the caowd has â you're
bluffing," said a man who bad been jostled
by the bearded man into a bad humor.
"That cry of silver is all a mistake.
What this country needs to bring back the
good old times is nothing more thaa a
protective tariff that will bring revenue
sufficient to run the Government and do
away with the necessity of issuing bonds.
Interest-bearing bonds at the rate they
are piling up on us will bankrupt the
Government in another four years.
"Let us have a McKinley tariff and the
mills wili start up, the people will be em
ployed and prosperity will return."
"Oh, give the other man a chance now,"
said tbe thin voice from the thin man.
The crowd surged and shuted and the
white hat ro;e and fell until its rather
undersized wearer got a footing. "Who
was it that burned the greenbacks after
the war and issued interest- bearing bonds
in their place? It was tho Republican
party," he said.
"And who was it that while returning
to sound money still paid off the tre
mendous National debt and paid the run
ning expenses of the Government at the
same time? It was the Republican party,"
Bai^ the man with the gray beaal, and the
crowd, which was a Populist crowd evi
dently, still could not refrain from a cheer.
"While keeping up a semblance of Na
tional credit, paying off the debt as it un
questionably did, the individual States
were during all that time running in to
â  debt hand over fist, issuing bonds aa
1 States and as cities and counties, and as
towns, and I am here to prove it."
"You are talking through your white
bat," said the man with the white beard.
"The difference between that time and
this is that cities and counties cannot issue

man who desired to work, gave a value to

"They can't be mortgaged, no money is

The crowd jostled and swayed again. A
man with a bigger voice thaa either
he of the white hat or he
of the white beard was explaining
to a neighboring group that neither silver
nor gold was the panacea; but that some
other and strange remedy was the thing.
He was catcning the crowd when a police

FUN FOR THEATER-GOERS
Arrival of the Empire Theater Com-
pany of Sew York With Three
Attractive Plays.
There is a treat in store for the
theater-goers of San Francisco. Charles
Frohman's Empire Theater Com
pany arrived last evening from
New York with its repertory of the
latest and most successful plays and will
reopen the regular season at the Baldwin
Theater next Monday. The company will
reuiain for three weeks, opening with
Clyde Fitch's comedy, "Bohemia," which
ran for 100 consecutive nights at the Em
pire Theater, New York. The latest suc
cessful comedy, entitled "The Benefit of
the Doubt," will occupy the boards
during the second week, while tbe third
and last week will be devoted to the
presentation of tbe brilliant comedy
drama, "The Masque raders." All of
these plays will be produced with the
same careful attention to detail and
scenic effects that characterized them at
the home theater in New York. Prices
will remain as usual, ana seats are now on
sale.
The company comprises Viola Allen,
the leading lady; William Faversham, the
leading man; Annie Irish, Ida Conquest,
May Robson, Mrs. Thomas Whiffen, Jane
Harwar, Ellen Gail, Katherine Mulkins,
Lottie Nicholl, Rose Morris, J. E. Dodson,
Robert Edeson, Ferdinand Gottscbalk, \V.
H. Crompton, E. Y. Backus, J. E. Finney,
Charles Young, Walter Day and George
Pierce.
"Bohemia" is a sensational success of life
in the Latin quarter, something of the
style of "Trilby." In it William Faver
sham plays the part of Rudolph, a poet,
Viola Allen that of Mimi and J. E. Dod
son, an old favorite here, that of Scbaum
ard, a musician. It is two years since the
company was is San Francisco and all the
plays this time are new to this City.
The players came direct from New York
in their special car, "Bohemia," and were
met at Sixteenth street by Manager Sam
uel Meyers and Ralph Pincus, the press
agent of the Baldwin and California the
aters. They had an uncommonly pleasant
trip and were all in exceptionally fine
spirits. Miss Allen is a beautiful brunette
and Miss Irish an equally beautiful blonde.
Their mental acquirements are on a par
with their physical attractions.
SAILED FOR AUSTRALIA,
Departure of the Oceanic Steam
ship Mariposa for
Sydney.
The Oceanic steamship Mariposa sailed
at 11:30 o'clock last night for Honolulu,
Apia, Auckland and Sydney, having been

wile, Paul Steinield, R. L. Malcolm, D. Mc-
Lean.
The occasion of the departure of the
charming Elliott sisters drew a large dele
gation of theatrical people down to the
wharf to bid them good- by. A short time
before the Mariposa sailed the fair Maxine
and her sister Gertrude came down to the
steamer escorted by Dan Frawley.
They immediately boarded the vessel
and went to their stateroom, whicli they
found a bower of choice flowers, parting
eifts from their friends. They will join
the Nat Goodwin Company in Melbourne,
to play a 12 weeks' engagement in the
colonies, after which they will probably
go to Johannesburg, South Africa.

THE CARNIVAL QUESTION
There Is Hearty Sympathy for
the Festival Move
ment
A FLOAT FOB THE CYCLERS.
Resolutions Indorsing the Nicaragua
Canal Projectâ Many N w
Members-
At the meeting of the Merchants' Asso
ciation yesterday the resignation of Ro
senthal Bros. <fe Co., 107 Kearny Btreet,
was accepted. This is the only resigna
tion received, although it had been stated
by some one connected *with the carnival
committee that a number of resignations
would take place in consequence of the
supposed antagonism of the Merchants'
Association's board of directors for the
carnival project.
The members of the board are very in
dignant that such a statement should have
been made, because they all favor the car
nival. The reason given for not taking up
the project with great interest is that such
a course would be to a great extent out
side of the aims and objects of the associa
tion. At the present time the body has
its hands full looking after the interests of
the City and in paying particular atten
tion to the condition of the streets and in
the promotion or the new charter.
The request of the Merchants' Associa
tion to have the special crew for guiter
cleaning resume work in Western Addition
lias been granted by Superintendent of
Streets Ashworth. The Superintendent
also explained that the work of this crew
bad been temporarily suspended last
month on account of the expected shortage
of lands and the uncertainty of the amount
to be appropriated. He promises that the
work will now be regularly continued.
The secretary reported that so many
delegates nad already been appointed for
the ctiurter convention from the various
progressive organizations of the City that
it had been decided to hoid the convention
in Kohler & Chase Hall, as the assembly
room in the Mills building would be too
small for the purpose. Owing to the fact
that the Association of Improvement
Clubs will hold its regular meeting nn
August 5, it was decideu to postpone the
charter convention from August 5 to
August 12, so that ail the delegates might
attend.
The board decided to have a float in the
cyclists' parade next Saturday night on
behalf of the Merchants' Association.
This float will be typical of the new char
ter and illustrate the difference between
the old and the new Sau Francisco.
The board decided favorably upon the
request of the association of creditors hav
ing claims against the City for goods sold
and delivered. The request is to have the
Board of Supervisors use the existing sur
plus from last year's tax levy in the pay
ment of these claims, provided it can
legally be done. A recommendation to
that effect was ordered sent to the Board
of Supervisors.
At the request of a number of merchants
and property-owners on Sixth street the
board decided to ask the railroad company
to improve its portion of the street, with a
view of having the pavement of the entire
street improved.
The secretary was instructed to accept
the invitation of the Continental League
to speak upon the new charter to-niglit
and the invitation of tbe cyclists' com
mittee to speak upon "good streets"
Saturday nieht.
A communication was received from the
Chamber of Commerce of Kan Francisco
asking the co-operation of the Merchants'
Association in favoring the early con
struction of the Nicaragua canal under
American control. In accordance there
with the following resolution was adopted
by the board of directors of the Mer
chants' Association:
Whereas, A patriotic appeal has been re
ceived from the Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco for the urgent, necessity of securing
favorable action upon the Nicaragua canal
before the termination of the Fif ty-iourth Con
gress; and whereas, the Merchants" Associa
tion of San Francisco fully realizes the vital
Importance to California of cheap and short
transportation by water to the markets of the
world; therefore be it
Resolved, That the Merchants' Association
earnestly requests our Senators and Repre
sentatives in Conpress to continue theirpraise
worthy efforts at the next session for the early
completion of the Nicaragua canal under
American control.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1896.
HOSTILE STOCKHOLDERS.
Directors of the American Pipe
and Pile Armor Company
Disliked.
Suit to Oust Officials Who Are
Claimed to Have Betrayed
Their Trusts.
There is another row on the hands of
the directors of the American Composition
Pipe and [ Pile Armor Company. Peter
Tautphaus, A. B. Hunt, H. C. Capweil, L.'
E. Ashley and E. F. BadgJey, who claim
to constitute that board, have been sued
several times recently, and all sorts of
charees as to their management of the
affairs of the company have been brought.
They have been accused of fraud, of over
stepping their authority as officers of the
company, and now they are said to have
been deposed from office, but to have re
fused to vacate.
Mrs. Eleanor L, White is plaintiff in a
suit filed Wednesday to oust the offending
directors. She claims ,. that at a recent
meeting of the company, at which over
80,000 of the 93,679 shares of its capital
stock were represented, 65,801 shares, more
than two-thirds of -. the entire number,
voted to displace the defendants.
However, .when the votes were counted,
President Tautphaus declared that but 62,
-181 shares had been voted against the di
rectors, he refusing to count 185 shares so
voted by A. J. Robinson, claiming they
had not been transferred on the books of
the corporation within ten days preceding
the election. One hundred and nine shares
of stock belonging ' to Mrs. E. L. White
were not allowed to be voted, it being
claimed that they had not been paid for.
The votes of 3186 shares belonging to the
estate of a. person named Ellsworth were
also repudiated, it being claimed that the
Public Administrator, who has charge of
the estate, has no right to give a proxy on
the stock.
By such proceedings the worthy, presi
dent managed \ to hold on to his office and
to keep his fellow-directors in power. He
then, despite the protests of the assembled
stockholders, declared the meeting ad
journed.
Not to be balked, however, another
chairman was chosen, and the 65,590 shares
of stock were vol. d for U. S. Gilbertson,
Isaac Jessup, A. J. Robinson, P. W. Kel
ley and F. A. McQee, who were declared j
elected directors, instead of the three in
cumbents.
As Tautphaus et al. refuse to step down
and out, the hid of the Superior Court in
hastening their departure is asked.

COSTA RICA TAKES
A GOLD STANDARD
Cogent Reasons Given by
Her Statesmen for
the Change.
NO FOREIGN SILVER.
The Little Republic Thinks the
Value of Silver Too
Fluctuating.
AN OFFICIAL DECREE ISSUED.
Valuable Material Forwarded by the
Correspondent of a Local Im
porting House.
Costs Rica . has declared, for a gold
standard. This is one of the most signifi
cant events of the times, as that country
has been run on a silver basis, the same as
the rest of the Central American re
publics, ever since a standard was estab
lished.
After struggling along through the sil
ver excitement of the last few years, Costa
Ricans gradually arrived at the conclusion
that something was wrongâ that a screw
was loose in the governmental machinery.
Like Jacob, the statesmen of the little
republic wrestled with the problem until
they reached a definite result, and that re
sult is embodied in the change from a sil
ver to a gold basis. Silver, they said, was
too much like merchandise â its value fluc
tuated. They decided that the prosperity
of the country lay in choosing a standard
with an unchangeable value. In their
opinion this would stop the banks from
importing silver and redeeming their
notes with it.
Yesterday the firm of Castle Bros. & Co.,
large importers and exporters of tea,
coffee and sjMcea, who deal principally
with the Central and South American re
publics, received a copy of La Gaceta, the
official organ of the Government of Costa*
Rica, bearing date of July 4, 1896. Accom
panying the journal was the following ex
planatory letter:
We send you under separate cover the Official
Gazette with a decree passed by Congress pro
hibiting the coming of or the introduction of
silver in any formâ all existing foreign silver
to be called In and paid for at its present
value, such imported silver not being a legal
tender after thirty days from the publishing of
the decree.
The next step oi the Government, we believe,
will be to issue its own paper payable in gold.
It is the idea of the Government to put the
country on a gold basis.
The decree, as published in La Gaceta,
is herewith published in full:
DECREE NO. 42.
THE COJJ6TITCTIONAI, CONGEESB OF THE REPUBLIC
OF COSTA RICA.
Considering that it is convenient to tne
economical interests of the country to avoid as
much as possible the increase of silver money,
which by its demerit and constant fluctua
tions has become a circulating medium of un
certain vaiue, and would, by its introduction
in the republic, and should it be maintained
as legal tender, be an obstacle to the adoption
of another metal of better value and to the
establishment oi a new monetary system on a
more solid basis, at the initiative of the execu
tive power, it is
DECREED.
Article Iâ Until a new monetary system is
established in the repub.ic the coinage of
national silver is prohibited.
Article llâ Ail foreign silver coins of every
value are declared out ol legal circulation.
Article lIIâ All the foreign silver coins at
present in circulation must be presented
within the thirty days following this decree to
the general revenue administration, to be ex
changed lor the National currency at the legal
value at which they circulate. After this term
those that may not have been presented will
be out of legal circulation and their disposition
be covered by. the stipulations of the preceding
article.
Article IVâ From this date on all the revenue
offices will abstain from accepting any foreign
silver money in payment of taxes of all kinds
and for any other motives.
Article Vâ During the thirty days designated
. In article 111 the importation of foreign silver
coins in prohibited. Whatever may be im
ported during said period will be reshipped or
retained in deposit at the respective custom
house at the importers' option.
Article Vlâ The foreign silver money thar,
according to article 111, may be preserved to
be exchanged for national currency must be
exported and sold in foreign markets for ac
count of the national treasury.
Article Vllâ The present law reforms in the
necessary points the articles 486 aud 489 of
the fiscal laws and derogates all laws and dis
positions opposed to this one.
Article Vlllâ This decree will come in force
from the date of LU official publication.
Transitory Articleâ The executive power is
hereby authorized, notwithstanding the dis
positions of this law, to allow the Bank of
Costa Eica, under the conditions and for the
amount and time that the executive power
should consider necessary and convenient to
the interests of the nation, the retention of
the foreign silver money that said bank holds
at present as a portion of its metallic reserve.
To the executive power, given in the Hall of
Sessions of the Congress, National Palace, San
Jose, the 3d day of the month of July of 1896.

MEETING OF MILKMEN.
They Auk That Some Consideration Be
Shown Them in Condemning
Cattle.
The Milkmens' Association of San Fran
cisco, met at Forester's Hall yesterday af
ternoon to discuss the grievances of its
members and regulate matters in reference
to the trade.
The principal topic of discussion was the
raids which tbe Health Inspector has been
making upon their nerds. President L. A.
Hayward voiced the sentiments of the
more conservative members when he said:
'â¢We do not intend to make any fight
against tbe inspection of our stock and
the condemnation of such diseased ani
mals as imperil the health of our cus
tomers.
"All we ask is time to weed out such
cattle, and some consideration, so that
some of us will not be entirely ruined by
the notoriety that we attain when one or
two cattle out of a herd are found to be
infected. The milkmen want to do what
is right and have no desire to fight any
just law."
No action was taken on tbe matter.
For some time past the milkmen have
been seriously annoyed by petty thieves
who steal mi'k-bottles from doorsteps and
sell them to junk men. The latter have
signified a willingness to return the bottles
for a consideration, and a committee, con
sisting of Messrs. Green, Vermer and
Robb, was appointed to arrange with tbe
junk-dealers to return the bottles to the
associatiou headquarters, on Twenty-first
street, and receive 2 cents apiece for them.
Other minor matters were discussed.
WISH TO CLOSE AT SIX
Retail Dry-Goods' Clerks Desire

to Wait Upon the Merchants
Who Keep Open Late.
About sixty salesmen from local retail

Jerome Donovan and J. M. Nye Jr. were
chosen temporary chairman and secretary
respectively. The chairman, by way of
introduction, read a well- worded adver
tisement of a large dry-goods house of
Toronto, Canada, whicb set forth clearly
and forcibly why that bouse cloÂ»ed each
day at 5 o'clock.
On motion of Mr. Pheips a committee
of one from each of the estiblishments
represented in the meeting wai appointed
by the chairman to wait upon those mer
chants now keeping open evenings and
ascertain if they intend to make such ar
rangement permanent. The following
were appointed such a committee: White
House, M. Cousins; O'Connor, Moffatt &
Co., T. Noonan ; D. Samuels, Jacob iiow
man; Newman & Levinson, J. Capalass;

Bros., J. Clarkson; J. J. O'Brien & Co.,
T. Crowley; Maze, P. Slattery; City of
Paris, Mr. Featherstonhaugh.
The next meeting of the body will be
next Thursday evening at 8 o'clock, when
a permanent organization will be effected
if the report of the investigating com mi t
i tee indicates the need of such an organ iza-
I tion.
A number of the rinns represented on
I the committee are now closing early and
! their employes have no grievances what
ever, but have entered the organization
for the sole purpose of aiding their fellow
clerks.
ROGERS SUES FOR $25,000
He Alleges a Breach of Contract
by the Emporium Com*
pany.
Wants Heavy Damages Because the
Emporium Shut Out His
Hardware-Store.
George M. Rogers, by his attorney, J. E.
Richards, bas begun suit against the Em
i porium Company, occupants of the new
j Parrott building on the south side of Mar
j ket street, between Fourth and Fifth, for
j $25,000 damages for breach of contract.
Mr. Rogers sets forth in his complaint,
j filed in the Superior Court, that on June 6
j last he entered into a contract with the
; Emporium Company to occupy certain
space in the building with a gen
eral hardware store; that the de
fendant, the Emporium Company, waa
to furnish and equip the space to be
occupied by the plaintiff with all store
fixtures and shelving necessary to the
transaction of business; that he is fully
prepared to carry out his part of the con
tract; that, relying upon the contract, he
purchased and has agreed to purchase a
I gene.al hardware stock to the extent of
about $14,000 and gave up his business
and other business prospects; that he ex
pected and arranged to carry not less than
a $16,000 stock, and that bis profits in the
conduct of the business would amount
to not less than $4500 a year. For the
reason that the defendant company bas
failed to keep its part of the contract it
has imposed great loss on him. In conse
quence thereof he brings suit for the
amount of damages stated.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1896.
GEORGIE WALKER
AND HIS BARREL
Judge Joachimsen Begins
to Take Testimony
About Them.
WATT OFFERS AN ALIBI.
He Testifies That He Knew
Nothing About the
Matter.
IN FACT, THAT HE WAS ABSENT
Extraordinarily Hard Swearing Which
Seemed to Puzzle the Court
Badly.
Judge Joachimsen began yesterday
afternoon to unravel the contradictory
testimony concerning the packing oi tittle
Georgie Walker, aged 7, in a barrel ont
THE BOY AND THE BARRELL.
The Little Plaintiff Telling His Story In Judge Joachimsen's Court
Francisco street. Francisco-street people
came to the courtroom as spectators and
witnesses by the dozens.
Thomas Walker, father of Georgie, was
there with his wife, his 9-year-old daughter
Ida and little Louis Contreras. aged also
about 9. Mr. Walker was the complainant.
He accused Billy Watt, aged about 21, of
placing Georgie Walker in a barrel, after
tying his hands, knees and feet, standing
him on his head and gagging him with a
stout cloth tightly fastened over the lad's
mouth. This, Mr. Walker stoutly averred,
was after threats had been made by Billy
Watt against the Walker children, and
Mr. Walker also expressed the belief that
Billy Watt intended, as soon as night
came, to throw the barrel and the lad into
the bay.
The testimony developed most remark
able aud positive contradictions, which
caused the court and Attorney Dare, who
prosecuted the case, to outwardly indi
cate amazement. Little Georgie Walker
stood up as a witness before the court and
swore positively that Billy Watt seized
him in the backward attached to the Watt
home, on Francisco street, and not only
tied him and gagged him as has been de
scribed, and stood him on bis head, but
also promised to throw him into the bay.
The small Walker boy described the oc
currence in great detail.
The rope with which he was tied was a
bale rope. He was sure that it was Billy
Watt who tied him because he had known
Billy Watt very well for some time, hav
ing frequently been playing in the Watt
yard when Billy was at home. He did
not see Billy put the head in the barrel,
but he heard the bJows a? the barrel head
was pounded down. All this time and for
some time after he, Georgie, was standing
upon his head. The ropes were tied
around him so tightly that they hurt him
and the gag also hurt. He did not ex
actly know how long he was in the barrel,
but when his little sister Ida came near
the barrel he called to her. Soon after he
was released and went home. He was not
quite clear who untied him or took him
out of the barrel. He was sure" that he
stood there, head down, for a time.
The little sister of Georgie Walker testi
fied under oath that she went out to search
for Georgie at her father's request. Siie
called the brother's name when she was
in the Watt yard and an answering voice
came from the barrel. She was sure that
the voice was Georgie's, and she at once
ran to tell her father about the matter.
Louis Contreras, a little Greek boy,
whose eyes areas black and round as bulbs
of jet, told what he saw. His story was
simply corroborative of Georgie Walker's
story. He seemed to be perfectly clear
concerning his recollection of the occur
rence so far as he observed it. He de
scribed just how Georgie was tied, and his
statement coincided with the Waiker boy's
testimony. Cross-examination by the* at
torney for the defense did not phase him
in the least.
Thomas Walker, the father of the lad,
was a hearsay witness, buw added some
facts. He testified that the Walker and
Watt children have been in the habit of
playing much together, being near neigh
bors on Francisco street. The usual
troubles incident to children have oc
curred. Billy Watt has threatened to kill
Georgie Walker if the lad came into the
yard. At first Mr. Walker did not attach
any importance to this threat, but ha has
come to the conclusion tbat his little boy
was in serious danger, and that Billy Watt
meant to do just what he bad threatened.
The Walker family was sitting down to
dinner and Mr. Walker looked about and
made a sort of rapid mental census of his
numerous flock of children and grandchil
dren and other relatives. He sent hia lit
tle daughter, Ida, out to look for Georgie,
who was missing, and the girl soon came
back with the story that Georgie was
in a barrel. He thought very little
about this story ; supposing, in fact, that
the missing boy had simply crawled into
a barrel for fun, then sent Louis Contreras
out. Louis is a small boy living also in
the Walker home. Very soon Georgie
and Louis came in. Georgie was very
white and pale and from hi? mouth and
nose blood was flowing, this being caused,
he supposed, by the tight pressure of the
gag, of which Georgie forthwith told. He
did not see Georgie urtil the ropes and
gag had been removed.
Three members of the Watt family took
the witness-stand and substantially agreed
upon a story which entirely contradicted
all that had been testified \o for the prose
cution.
A small boy, aged 11 years, who con
fessed to the name of "Shorty" Watt, wss
the first witness for the delense. He saw
Georgie Walker in the barrel. The barrel
had contained wood, but this had been
removed. Georgie was not placed in the I
barrel. "Ohâ hâ h no; he jumped in
there himself. There were no ropes on
the arms or legs oi the Walker boy. There
was no gag in his mouth. Billy Watt was
not around the place at all, but was away
at work. Georgie entered the barrel to
hide from and tease his little sister. He
was not in the barrel long, and he jumper
out by himself."
"Jumped out when he was standing on
his head?" asked Judge Joachimsen sur
prised.
"He jumped ont."
â¢'Jumped out head first or feet first?"
The witness was not clear about how
Georgie jumped, but was sure of the main
fact.
Then Billy Watt, the defendant, con
tradicted the story for the prosecution.
He was not at home, be said, until hours
after the occurrence. It had been testified
that Georgie was missed and also discov
ered not far from 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
The defendant was confident that he could
prove an alibi for himself between the
hours of 7 a. m. ana Bp. m. He is a ped
dler, and was out with his cart all day
between 7 a. m. and Br. H., and this fact
he could substantiate by the man who
went along with him on the cart. He did
not see Georgie Walker once during the
entire day in which the barrel episode
occurred.
Jacob Kahler, a neighbor, who lives on
Francisco street, midway between the
Walkers and the Watt family, was at
home all day, and was quite sure that
Billy Watt did not return until after 7
p. m., but admitted that Watt might pos
sibly have come home unseen to him.
William Watt, father of the defendant,
testified that his son. the defendant, was
not at home from 7 a.m. until 8 p. m., or a
little later.
By this time Judge Joachimsen looked
very much puzzled. So was Mr. Walker,
who brought the complaint. The court
at this point took a recess nntil this
morning, when Billy Watt will try to per
fect his alibi.

WILL WEAVE AGAIN,
BUT IN JAPAN,
Last of the Abandoned
Woolen-Mills on North
Beach.
LOOMS FOR THE ORIENT
The Machinery Purchased by
a Syndicate in
Osaca.
JAPANESE MECHANICS HERE.
Eight Little Machinists Come Over
the Pacific to Move the
Machines.
The hardest blow that the old woolen
mills on North Beach have received came
some days ago when the machinery was
sold to a Japanese syndicate. The sale
meant the tearing out of looms and other
woolen-making machines tbat should be
singing their merry song of enterprise and
industry over the bay; and also the trans
planting of much of a California industry
to the heart of rising and energetic Japan.
And then most likely the doth spun out
away in the Orient on these same spindles
and looms may come in through. the
Golden Gate for sale in the market of San
Francisco. Such is the view taken of the
deal by a local merchant.
The industrious Japanese saw their op
portunity, comparatively small as it was,
and seized it without a second thought.
They went to work quietly and purchased
all the available machinery in the long
deserted mills, with a view of transferring
it to their own country and setting it up
tbere in positions identical with those oc
cupied on the floors of the San Francisco
woolen-mills.
Negotiations for the purchase were con
ducted through G. Abrabamson of 127
Sansome street, the local agent of Isaacs &
Brother, the millionaire silk lirca of Japan
and New York.
As soon as satisfactory terms were
reached the company sold tbe machinery
to the Japanese syndicate, which operates
extensive woolen and cotton mills in
Osaca, Japan.
On the last steamer from the Orient
eight Japanese mechanics, who included
machinists, millwrights and carpenters,
arrived in San Francisco from Osaca.
They were sent here to take down the
complicated and massive machinery and
to pack it ail for transport.
For a week or more these little mechanics
working in their own peculiar way have
been busy from morning until night in
the abandoned though stately factory
building near Black Point. American
mechanics would be amused at some of
tbe Japanese methods of lowering a heavy
shaft from tbe rafters, but these little fel
lows know their own business.
Secretary Scott of tbe woolen company
stated yesterday that tbe Japanese con
cern had bought the shafting with pulleys,
supports and hangers, also several spindles,
"mules'" for spinning threads, ten carding
machines for treating the wool and sever
al looms.
They were sold in balk for a sum which
clearly gave the Japanese a good bargain
in comparison with the original cost oi
the machinery. The same men who are
now taking down tbe machinery will erect
it in the Osaca mills.
Little more will remain in the big red
brick building when the Japanese will
have withdrawn with their cargo of
machines, so it is expected that Fontana
& Co., the fruit-can ners, will conduct their
canning operations in the old mills this
season. ____________
STREETS MISNAMED.
A Mew System of Nomenclature Adopted
by the Streetcar Con
ductors.
One of the mysteries connected with
Btreet-railroad travel in South San Fran
cisco is the proper names of the streets
leading into Kentucky. The railroad com
pany has instructed its conductors on the
electric cars to name the streets running
east and west by the Mission designation,
such as Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eight
eenth, and so on, whereas the official
names differ. Sixteenth stops at Harrison
and Center streets from that point and
runs to the bay.
Santa Clara becomes Seventeenth, Mari
posa and Solano become Eighteenth,
Butte, Nineteenth, and Napa, where the
Union Iron Works is located, would be
Twentieth. This system of the railroad
change of names continues to Butcher
town, or First avenue, which would be a
continuation of Twenty-sixth street ac
cording to the railroad nomenclature of
the streets.
As a consequence of this peculiar sys
tem people who may be traveling on the
cars with the intention of getting off at
some of tbe recognized streets, such as
Butte or Napa, have been compelled to
consult the map of the City as to the
proper place to get off the cars, otherwise
they are liable to be carried far beyond
their destination, with the result to them
of being compelled to pay an additional
fare to return to tne place where they in
tended to alight.
The roadbed between the com
pany's tracks the entire lentrth of Ken
tucky street is in a shameful condition, so
much so that the basalt blocks are forced
out of their places on tbe street, necessi
tating the conductors getting off the cars
and replacing the stones so that the cars
may not be thrown off the track by the
obstructions.
Complaint has been made to the Street
Superintendent of the bad condition of
this street from time to time, but no no
tice has been taken of them.

MRS, DAGGETT
CETS A DIVORCE,
The Decree Was Granted
in Judge Hebbard's
Court.
FAILURE TO PROVIDE.
The Marriage Was Celebrated
in Oakland, October
3. X BB3.
A HAWAIIAN HONEYMOON.
Rollin M. Daggett Was Then Unitea
States Minister to the King
dom of Hawa<i.
Yesterday Judge Hebbard granted Liz
zie M. Daggett a divorce from Rollin M.
Daggett on the ground of the defendant's
willful neglect in failing to provide for his
wife. The parties were married in Oak
land, October 3, 1883. As Mrs. Daggett is
abundantly able to care for herself by rea
son of her own private fortune, the hus
band's alleged neglect has not been a
hardship from a material point of view.
The defendant in this suit is a well
known public man. He gained quite a
reputation as a writer of ability on the
Nevada press in the early seventies. He
waa elected to Congress from that State
and served with distinction.
â  Mr. r Daggett was appointed United
States Minister to Hawaii under the Gar
field administration, and at Honolulu he
met the lady in whose favor the divorce
was : granted. . She was ,ay- tourist, who
owned considerable property in Southern
California, and was making the tour of
the , islands with;; her mother and sister.
She and the Minister had similar tastes
and 7 inclinations, and .- so ' an attachment
for ; each ; other y was formed, which culmi-.
nated in the marriage at Oakland in 1883.
He obtained a leave: of absence from bis
post of duty in order to have the marriage
celebrated in the United States. â  r - â¢
His v duties as United States Minister
were 5 resumed on his . return -â¢> to Hawaii.
He and his bride entertained American
visitors and others ; in 1 - a style - becoming
their station. ;" He was gracious in the be
stowal ol hospitality to their Honored
guests, and he likewise was held: in high
esteem by his fellow-countrymen ; and tha
people of Hawaii. V She had large resources
of money, and property in hii own right,
and he was in receipt of his official salary
and also of sums of money earned- by his
gifted pen in literary ? lines. King Kala
kaua and t: Minister ?DaÃgett collaborated
and delightful productions, full of island
traditions and poetry, were the result.
; : Shortly after . President '; Cleveland : was
chosen to rule : over the -destinies' of this
country a Democrat was appointed United
States Minister to Hawaii 1 , to succeed; Mr.
Daggett/ Mr.' Daggett, accomoanied by his
wife, returned io the United States. He
had an ambition : . to represent Nevada in
the United States Senate, but his desire in
this regard was not gratified. Perceiving
i that iurthei liouois and emoluments â¢ ia j
public life were not readily attainable,
Mr. Daagett again resumed literary work,
contributing to The Call, Overland
Monthly and other publications. On a
ranch near Vacaville Mr. and Mrs. Daggett
resided for several years.

yesterday morning, was stjuck on the face by
a scantling that fell from the top of a building
