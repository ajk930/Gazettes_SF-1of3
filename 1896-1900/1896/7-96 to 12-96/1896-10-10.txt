RAIL DISASTER
NEAR PALO ALTO
Northbound Freight Train
Crashes Into Runaway-
Boxcars.
Engineer Haggerty Killed and
Fireman Bowsher Badly
Injured.
BURIED UNDER THE WRECKAGE
Twisted Iron and Splintered Wood
Piled Forty Feet High Upon
the Track.
1 PALO ALTO, Cal., Oct. 9.â A north
bound freight train on the coast division of
the Southern Pacific collided shortly after
2 o'clock this morning with three empty
boxcars, which had escaped from the Palo
Alto switch and were running down grade
on the main line. Engineer Henry Hag
gerty was instantly killed. Fireman Jo
seph T. Bowsher suffered fractures of sev
erai bones and internal in juries of a serious
nature. Trainman C. W. Bence was badly
hurt. Engine and train were piled in a
heap forty feet high upon the track and
reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal
and splintered wood.
The grade falls rapidly from Palo Alto
as far down as Mountain View and the run
away cars had gained a five or six mile
momentum when the smashup occurred,
half war between Palo Alto and Mayfield.
How the empty cars got onto the main
track is not definitely known. It is said
that they were not "braked," as they
should have been, when sidetracked.
Others say that miscreants must have
started the cars, but there seems to be
little proof to back this assertion.
The train coming north waa composed
of eight heavily laden box and fiat cars,
and was traveling at the rate of thirty or
forty miles an boar as it does not stop or
dinarily at Palo Alto or Mayfield. The
cars were filled with sacked wheat, flour,
wool and asphaitum, and there was a
quantity of butter, eggs and fowls in one
of the cars. The train and the moving
cars met directly over a "trap" in tne
track, and to this was doubtless due a part
of the phenomenal telescoping that fol
lowed. The empty freight cars were
tossed twenty feet from the track, with
the exception of the first car, which slid
under the fore part of the engine and was
crushed to fragmelitK The engine turned
almost completely over; the cow-caicher
i being jammed into the ground and the
1 tender being thrown Into the air, resting
on the rear end of the locomotive fifteen
feet above the ground. The loaded cars in
the rear were piled up one upon another
to a height of thirty or forty feet on and
about the engine.
The force of the shock is evidenced by
the rails, which were bent like fibers and
snapped in places like needles, while solid
wheels and axles were broken into bits.
The heavy wooden backing of the bump
ers on the cars is sheared into long,
stringy splinters, each grain separated
from the others. Over the whole pile was
a promiscuous mix-up or wheat, flour and
potatoes. How any living thing could
have escaped is a mystery; nevertheless
most of the chickens did escape death in
tne wreck, but only to fall into the hands
of those standing about, who carted them
off, with little regard for their ownership.
Another peculiar fact was that a number
of crates ef ecg3 endured the shock and
were uninjured so far as external appear
ance goes.
Haggerty was probably killed instantly.
His mangled body was recovered under
the engine about an hour after tne colli
sion occurred. It was at first believed
that Fireman Bowsher was also killed, but
the rescuers heard his groans and cries
while at work and released him from his
dangerous predicament. He was at once
placed in the hands of a physician, who
did everything in his power to relieve the
sufferings of the injured man. Whether
any tramps were on the brakebeams is un
known ; the removal of the wreckage alone
â will show that.
Scene of the Freight Wreck Near Palo Alto. Engine and Cars Piled Forty Feet High in a Mass of Twisted Iron and Splintered Wood
The San Francisco Call
Haggarty.was a popular engineer among
his brother-engineers, and a trusty, care
ful man. For seven years he was engineer
on the Santa Cruz division, and had a
wide circle of friends in that section.
Bowsher is not so well known among the
train crews, but is a steady, cheerful fel
low.
Said one of the grizzled old engineers
who watched the operation of ' laying the
switch about the wreck to allow passage
of trains : "That is one of the worst smash
ups I ever saw, and I've seen some bad
ones. Just think what the loss of life
would had been had it bean a passenger
train instead of a freight."
It is quite probable that the engineer
and tireman of the freight did not see the
runaway cars until they were directly
upon them, and Haggerty probably never
knew wnat happened. The night was so
dark that all beyond the range of the en
gine's headlight was absolutely invisible.
If the engineer did survive for a fraction
of a minute his agonies must have been
appalling, for escaping steam penetrated
every cranny of that portion of the wreck.
People who live near the scene of the
collision say that they were awakened in
stantly by the shock arid the subsequent
noise. From the moment the dreadful
accident occurred until long after dark to
night the wreck has been surrounded by
hundred* of onlookers. "*
The work of removing the wreckage
from the main line will occupy two daysâ
so the foreman of the wrecking crew states
âand in tne meantime trains are running
about the heap on a hastily constructed
switch.
Last fall a very similar wreck. was nar
rowly averted in the same spot, when a
number of cars laden with coal escaped
from the side track running up to the
Stanford University campus and missed
hitting a passenger train by but a few feet.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 9.â Coroner
Secord began an inquest this afternoon at
Palo Alto over the body of Engineer Henry
Hagjrerty, who was killed in the wreck
this morning. A jury of eight men was
impaneled and three witnesses were exam
ined to identify the deceased. '

KNOW NOT WHOM TO BLAME.
Southern Pacific Officials Cannot Account
for the'jbisnstcr.
The Southern Pacific officials in San
Francisco declared they could not ac
count for the cause oi the Palo Alto
wreck â that is, how the two freigbt
cars happened to be on the main track.
All the information regarding the wreck
received at Mr. Fillmore's office came in a
telegram early in the morning. This con
tained the merest outline of the accident
and some additional matter in the Jorm
of a report which told the track had not
been cleared and a temporary track was
laid around the wreck so that trains could
run through on time.
The accident occurred at 2:10 a. m ,
which is known from a remarkable inci
dent of the smash-up. The conductor was
in the caboose when the crash came. He
was thrown up against the cupola with
great force and received a very bad
shaking, but the only real damage done
waa the shattering of his watch. As the
hands pointed io 2:10 it is known that is,
the time the accident happen- d.
Assistant Manager N. H. Foster stated
that all energy was at first expended on
restoring communication along the line.
Then an effort was made to discover the
cause of the wreck. According to official
reports two freight cars were on the siding
at Palo Alto, but somehow had become
free and moved on to the main line.
There is a slight grade downward toward
the south from the switch, and this ac
count* for the movement ot the cars.
It proves to be a wholly different ques
tion as to how the cars evf.r got away at
first. The railroad managers said they
believed it was the work of some miscre
ant who, under cover of darkness, delibe
rately turned off the orakes and let the
cars move from the switch by gravity and
their own momentum.
However, there was a possibility that
the trainmen, after switching the
two freigntcars at Pa o Alto, bad failed to
secure them by tightening the brakes,
with the result that the cars moved down
the gentle grade. Which theory is right
occupied the Southern Pacihc detectives
and operating department all day, but
the result of their inquiries was not satis
factory.
It would not be admitted that the brakes
and their attachments were at fault, hav
ing been in a worn-out condition and ut
terly incapable of holding the cars in
check. As the brakes were broken in the
crash all evidence of possible neglect was
gone.
Bowsher is stated to have been the only
striking fireman to be taken back by the
railroad. He used to lire for Littlejohn,
one of the oldest engineers running on
the western division to Sacramento. He
is well known in West Oakland.

MAJOR M'KINLEY'S VISITORS.
From East Tennessee and Virginia
They Journey lo Cheer the Next
President.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 9.â ln addition to
the activity here to-day Major McKinley
was enabled to hear the shouts and sounds
from the great demonstration in Chicago
and the tramp of a hundred thousand
marchers by long-distance telephone in
Major McKinley's study and Mrs. Mc-
â¢A.3UT. I -A. , K33STC3-?
Kluley'a llving-ro<-ni. Th." telephone com
pany put a direct Chicago wire into the
McKinley house for use to-day and there
were twelve receivers attached to this
end of it.
The tirst delegation to arrive was that
from East Tennessee, about 500 strong,
and they were all enthusiastic and demon
strative. The spokesman was Editor Wil
liam Rule of Knoxviile. Among those in
the deleeation were the donors of the
large hickory stump which Major McKin
ley received some time ago Irom King
County, Tennessee. The candidate to-day
made use of the stump for the first time.
In addressing the Tennesseeans Major
McKinley spoke as follows:
The honor of this call is mine, not yours. I
appreciate that you have come a great dis
tance, almost the greatest distance of any
delegation which has yet visited me, to pay
your respects to me, not personally, but rather
to testify your devotion to the principles of the
Republican party and your determination that
those principles shall triumph at the election
on the 3d day of November. Your presence
here recalls pleasant and Inspiring memories
connected with the early history of your State.
A delegation of 500 miners from Mo
nongahela County, Fa., then marched
up to the house. Thomas Pollock made a
short speech of introduction, to which
Major McKinley responded. The next
delegation, also a Pennsylvania one, was
made up of citizens from Warren ana
Forest counties and numbered 600. Mr.
McKinley addressed them as follows:
If I ever had any doubt as to the extent of
the population of the State of Pennsylvania
that doubt has been removed since the St.
Louis convention. [Laughter and applause.]
I think that I have had the honor of a call
from nearly all Western Pennsylvania, and as
far east as Harrisburg, all coming upon the
same mission, all determined upon the game
i
â¢ endâ that of contributing their part to the
success of the grandest principles that were
ever advocated by any political party and of
the greatest party in the world. [Applause.]
We have had in this country since the be
ginning of the Government a trial of two reve
nue systems. One has been known as the tariff
for revenue only, the other has been the pro
tective system. We had had no experience
under the former for so many lone years that
people had totally forgotten the distress which
was the result of the inauguration of that sys
tem. We have had some experience with it
during the last three years and a half (A
voice â "We don't want any more ot It,
though"], and, as my friend says, we don't
want any more of it. [Applause.] This is one
of the things you have a chance to vote on on
the third day of November.
Clinton County, Ohio, farmers to the
number of 800 followed the last delega
tion. Clinton County is in tne rich agri
cultural section ot Ohio, and its citizens
are among the most prosperous farmers in
the world. It is a strong Republican
county. These points were brought out
by the spokesman, Judge Adon. Major
Mi Kinley had not been notified of the
coming of this delegation and his remarks
were wholly impromptu.
The speech which Major McKinley ex
pected to make first was made last. The
ex-Confederate veterans who were ex
pected to arrive at 8:30 in the morning
did not all reach Canton until 4p. m.
They came on three special Burlington
and Ohio trains from the Valley of the
Shenandoah, and the party numbered in
the aggregate nearly 2000. One-half of
them were men who had worn the Con
federate gray and fought under Stone
wall Jackson. The veterans were met at
the train by the Grand Army posts of
Canton and Btark County and by the

MARTIN KELLY'S WATERLOO,
Auditorium Ticket De
clared Regular by Su
preme Court.
BUCKLEY ALSO MEETS
WITH DEFEAT,
There Can Be Only One Legal
Convention for Each Party
in the Field.
REGISTRAR ENTITLED TO DECIDE
WHICH IS THAT ONE.
Supreme Court Decision Which Laid Low Would-
Be Boss Kelly and Boss Buckley at the
Same Time- at One Stroke â Ruef
Is Crestfallen.
...
The Kelly- MahonÂ«y faction were
given a stinging blow by the Supreme
Court yesterday. " li. X,. worth, the
candidate of that faction for Superin
tendent of Streets of this City, and
James B. Brown, candidate for Sena
torial honors from the Seventeenth
Senatorial District, were denied the
writ ot mandate by -which they sought
to compel 'William M. Hlnton, Regis
trar, to file their certificates of nomina
tion.
Vi At the same time the court' denied the
petition for a similar writ to D, A. Mac
donald, the Buckley candidate for the
position of Superintendent of Streets.
â¢ The Farns worth and Brown cases were
set up as tests' by the Kelly- 31 ahoney
ites, one concerning the ' strictly muni
cipal and the other the legislative
ticket. The Buckley Democrats rested
their case on the issue of the petition
of Slacdonald alone.
The opinion of the court was .-written
by Justice McFarland, and Justices
Hens haw, Van Vleet and Temple . con
curred. Justices Harrison, Beatty and
Garroutte dissented.
The point of the decision Is that "a po
litical party which at the last election
polled at least 3 per cent of the entire vote
can be represented only by one conven
tion," and that "where two or more bod
ies claim to be the convention contem
plated by the code the Registrar must de
termine which one of the bodies was an
organized assemblage of delegates repre
senting, the particular political party
named."
For days .' the Kellv-Mahoney faction
has been : anxiously watching for this de
cision as a drowning man might grasp at
a straw. Fifteen , minutes after the deci
sions of the courts were handed into the
office of the clerk a woe- begone delegation
from the - Kelly-Mahoney , headquarters
filed in and read with growing solemnity
the decision which ended their attempt to
force ' the , Registrar to give them official
recognition.
"You may be happy yet," a bystander
jocularly suggested to A. Ruef.
"I shall not get happy on such decisions
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
as this," said Ruef, with deep melancholy.
Ruef was paler than usual, and it wad
apparent to the most casual observer that
he felt the blow keenly. The delegation
with him were equally depressed. They
sat in silence for awhile and then put out
the gas and went home utterly broKen ia
spirit.
The court took up first the case of Mao
donald against Uinton and rendered the
following decision :
The writ should be denied. Whether a Beg.
istrwr, in filing or refusing to file acroS-tred
certificate of nomination by a convention, acts
ministerially or judicially, it is clear that he
cannot be commanded by mandamus to do an
act which the law does not require him to do.
Now, sections 1186-87 of the Political Coda
clearly contemplate that a political party
which at the last election polled at least 3 pel
cent of the entire vote can be represented by
only one convention. A contrary view would
certainly defeat the purpose of the law. There
fore when each of the two or more bodies
claim to be the convention contemplated by
the code the Registrar must determine in the
first instance, at least, which one of the bodies
was "an organized assemblage of delegates
representing" the particular political party
named.
To say that the presentation of a certificate
in due form is conclusive of the essential fact
upon which the alleged right rests is to an
nounce the principle that each party to a con
troversy is the exclusive judge of his own case.
If the issue were presented here whether or
not the convention which the petitioners
represent was the convention which in fact
represented the Democratic party, then this
court would have to consider whether or not
it would, upon mandamus, hear evidence and,
after a trial here, itself determine the essen
tial fact in dispute.
But this proceeding was submitted upon the
admission that the convention represented by
petitioners only "claimed to be," but was not
a convention representing said political party,
and upon the theory that a Registrar was
bound to file their certificate because it was ia
due and regular form.
Therefore tha question whether or not this
court should, upon mandamus, inquire into
the fact and determine whether such conven
tion did or did not represent said political
party is not before us.
It tnerefore does not appear that the
Registrar has refused to do any act which the
law enjoins upon him as a duty. The pe
tition for the writ of mandamus is denied and
the proceeding dismissed.
The decisions in the cases of Farns
worth against Hinton and Brown against
Binton were in few words as follows:
Upon the authority of Macdonald vs. Hinton,
S. F. No. 684, this day decided the applications
for writs of mandamus in above cases are
denied and the proceedings dismissed, the
cases being substantially alike and having all
been considered together.
A special dissenting opinion was filed
by Justice Garroutte in the case of Mao
donald, which is as follows:
I dissent There are three constructions to
be placed upon the statute: 1. That the action
of the Registrar is final and conclusive. 2,
That it is the duty of the Registrar to decide
as a fact whether or sot the certificate pre
sented to him comes from the regular and
genuine Democratic or Republican party
which it purports to represent, and that suca
decision by him is reviewabie by this court.
3. That it is vhe duty of the Registrar to fill all
certificates which upon their face comply with
the statute, and that upon rejection by him
of any such the remedy is by mandate of this
court.
To hold that the action of tne Registrar is
final I cannot indorse for a moment Every
Â»|Bj| ba 118 Ij 1 TmMS2
court which has given the question any eon
gideration whatever has held against such a
construction. It is placing a Dower so tremen
dous in the hands of the Registrar that such a
construction should not be held if possible to
avoid It. If the language needs construction
it should be construed in some other direction.
If the rejection of a certificate by a Registrar
is final, if it is beyond all review by courts he
could refuse to file all certificates purporting
to come from opposing political parlies and in
effect bold the result of the election in the
hollow of his hand.
The Secretary of State, by refusing to file a
petition presented to him coming from one of
the great political rarties ol this State, could
absolutely prevent that party, through its
electors, from voting for a candidate for Presi
dent of these United States. It is needless to
say that the court Is bound to look further for
the true construction of this aot.
The secoud construction suggested, in my
opinion, cannot be maiutained. It seems im
possible that it was ever intended for this
court to enter into a trial of fact as to which
set of claimants constituted the regular, true,
genuine Democratic or Reublican party. It is
admitted by counsel that such question of fact
is not to be determined by tue principle or
principles represented by these respective
claimants; but it Is insisted that such ques
tion of fact must be decided by an investiga
tion as to the regularity of the organization;
that respective abstracts of title must be fur
nished and that the legal title must prevail.
Such an investigation would opeu up most in
teresting fields as to titles in real estate. I
see no way ol cutting off the investigation un
til it goes back to the orignal or paramount
source of title, whetner that original title
originated in thd City, State or Nation.
I do not know what particular principles oi
law could be invoked in the investigation of
such a fact. Its determinution would depend
upon tlie validity of the action ol a commit
tee, and this validity would depend upou the
regularity and validity of motions to adjourn,
to reconsider, to lay on the table, to postpone,
or to what constitutes a majority, a quorum, a
special meetinc, a legal committee, and a
thousand other matters purely of parlimen
tary usage.
In the trial of such a question Blackstoae
and Kent would be entirely displaced by
Cashing and Phillips, and such a question
had better como for consideration before a
high-school debating society than a court of
last resort. Again let us assume that the
genuine Central Committee, which guided the
destinies of its party, all resign. The power
to perpetuate the organization rested in its
hanos aloue, and now the committee is no
more.
Thus a great party would be placed In &
sorry plight. It would be placed in the pos i
tion of a trust without a trustle, and I pre
sume, upon the happening of such a grave
emergency, a court of equity would till the
breacn and appoint a new committee. Let us
assume a case where the committee would
neither resign nor take any steps to nominate
a ticket to be voted for by its party electors.
We thus have a present, live organization;
it is regular; there is no flaw in its title; it is
beyond suspicion; it represents and stands
for the Republican party, but it does nothing.
Under such circumstances is it possible that
no Republican ticket could be placed in the
political field for -which Republicans might
cast their votes? Time is too short for me to
indulge iv other suggestions showing absurd
results. It is not because they do not exist,
for they are more and worse ; aud lam of the
opinion that this construction must not ob
ttin if there is auy other road to travel, how
ever long and rough it may be.
1 think the third construction contended for
should be adopted, and that when a certifl
cate is presented to the Registrar which is in
the form required by the law he is bound to
receive and file it. Penalties are provided
against forging certificates, and it is further
provided that affidavits as to the truthfulness
oi the facts therein recited must be attached.
In a limited way these provisions seem to
afford the Registrar some protection; but,
however that may be, iÂ£ the protection against
fraud is insufficient it is tne fault of the law.
The statute provides that the Registrar must
"then and there forthwith" act upon the cer
tificate presented either by accepting or re
jecting it. The very language itself clearly indi
cates that there snail be no hearing on the
facts. The language, ex necessitate, precludes
such hearing. If the Registrar is not first to
investigate the facts, then certaiuly the law
does not contemplate that the court shall sub
sequently investigate them. The result of the
construction which I think should be adopted
is simply this:
All certificates valid upon their face shonld
be received and filed, and if two or more cer
tificates are presented by persons claiming to
represent the same party they should be filed
and the nominees thereon have an equal
chance upon a ballot.
The only serious result to flow from such
holding is that it tends to disorganize and dis
integrate party organizations. Of all the evils
it is the least, and this being so, it will be
assumed that the Legislature intended the
statute to be so construed. The intention of
the Legislature in this regard could be made
plainer and probably the objections hero sug
gested could be avoided by luture legislation.
Possibly the whole law should be repealed by
reason of its many crudities and contradic
tions. Tbe writ should be granted.
BUSINESS BLOCKS BURNED
One* Third of the Mercantile Por
tion of Corning, lowa, Re
duced to Ashes.
Stories of Incendiarism Are Aflcat,
cut Sparks From a Locomotive
Caused the Fire.
CORNING, lowa, Oct. 9.â Corning was
Visited this mornine with a terrible con
flagration, involving the loss of a third ot
its business houses with a total value of
$150,000. At 3 o'clock the fire alarm
awakened the sleeping inhabitants to the
fact that the large Reynolds grain eleva
tor at the depot was ablaze. The water
works became out of order and nothing
could be done to stop the fire. Three box
cars caught fire from the elevator, and
when the sides of one of them had caved
in the charred body of a man was discov
ered. Identification is impossible, but It
is supposed that he was a tramp.
Hardly had the people returned to their
beds when they were called out again to a
fire in Beymer's store. Telegrams for as
sistance were sent to Creston, Clarinda
and Red Oak, but before aid could arrive
two whole blocics had been swept away.
The fire in the elevator was caused by
sparks from a Jocomotive, .*he elevator
sparks setting fire to the Beymer build
ing. Stories of incendiarism, however,
are afloat. The heaviest losses were suf
fered by A. B. Turner, $75,000, uninsured;
H. H. Lame, $9000. partly insured, and
the National Bank of Corning, $12,000, in
sured for $5000. The insurance of $30,000
is distributed pretty equally among the
leading insurance companies.

SIOUX FALLS, S. D., 0ct.,9. â Over
100 men and women drew William J.
Bryan through the muddy streets of Sioux
Falls to-day and thousands of people from
that place and from near-by points in
South Dakota, lowa and Minnesota
turned out in the cold rain to do him
honor. Mr. Bryan never had a reception
more heartily enthusiastic. When he
reached Sioux Falls at 2 o'clock he was
placed in an open carriage and the
wildly cheering residents grasped the at
tached ropes and drew him along to the
house of C. E. Jewett, where he had
luncheon, an elaborate procession accom
panying him. Eigaty veterans of the
war acted as a personal escort. A feature
of the parade was a big wagon filled with
girls dressed in while frocks, who are do
ing missionary work for the Democratic
candidate by "'tabooing" men who believe
in the gold standard. They bore a banner
inscribed, "No goldbug need apply."
There was a cavalcade of mounted men in
the procession escorting Mr. Bryan. The
schools of the city were closed and near
Mr. Jewett's residence the pupils were
drawn up in two lines, through which the
candidate passed. The girls had small
flags and waved them vigorously.
Ther&in had become a steady downpour
when Mr. Bryan reacned the point where
the speech-making took place. Despite
the drenching they received, the crowd of
10,000, including 2000 Nebraskans, who
came *n the excursion train, showed the
heartiest enthusiasm aud were ever ready
to shout their approval of Mr. Bryan's re
marks.
Mr. Bryan was presented by John A.
Bowler, chairman of the State Central
Committee. The candidate spoke only
eighteen minutes, devoting his remarks
principally to defending Senator Petti
crew, who sat on the platform, from the
charge of disloyalty in leaving the Repub
lican party with Senator Teller at St.
Louis. Up said:
All things considered, this is one of the most
remarkable meetings which it has peen my
pleasure to address during this campaign. The
interest which has been manifested, the zeal
which you have shown, evidence a denre on
the part of those who have turned out under
these uniayorab:e conditions to testify their
determination to do their duty in thin cam
paign. 1 appreciate tiie interest which you
are taking. 1 appreciate the attendance of
the battle-scarred veterans of this country
[cheers], and I can assure them that their in
terest, the interest of the old soldier, will be
safe in the hands of those who believe that
this Nation is great enough to attend to its
own business. [Cheers.] The soldier will not
find it necessary to put his interest in the
hands of those who believe that we must pro
cure the consent ol foreign nations before we
can set oar tines on the financial policy.
[Cheers.]
I am glad to come to this city, because In
coming it gives me a chance to say a word in
delense of Senator Pettigrew among his own
people. [Tremendous cheering.] Aly friend.-,
there are times, there are occasions which try
men's souls. To leave one's party associates
is not an easy metier, and far more difficult
to do is thai duty when the person who leaves
is one who has received honors at the hands of
his party, but, mr friends. I believe that Sena
tor Pettigrew did the manly thing and the
courageous thing when he determined to pro
tect the interests of the people in this State in
stead of bowing under :hc yoke of the gold
standard. [Great cheering.]
I am glad to have the bo:id syndicate against
me, because when lam elected they wiii not
come down an-t try to get me to sell bonds to
thematslo4}Â£ when they are worth $1 10.
[Great applause.] But I notice tnis. my friends,
that the people who have left the Democratic
party do not give their real reason foi leaving;
in fact, I may be wrong to say they bare le:t
the party. They have been dragged out of the
party by the great corporation interests that
run them. [Cheers.]
HURON, &. D., Oct. 9.â lt was 8:30
o'clock when Mr. Bryan arrived here on
his special train, two . hours i behind time,
accompanied by Senator Peitigrew. John
Tomlinson of Alabama, member of the
National Advisory Committee, and others.
On the run up from ' Sioux Falls stops
were made at Montrose, Salem, Canova,
Vilas and other places. - Crowds were at
all of these places, and Mr. Bryan spoEe
several times. At Salem a brakeman
named Desmond, from Omaha, was badly
crushed between Mr. Bryan's car and an
other which he was coupling to it.
A big audience greeted the candidate
here. In nis speech Mr. Bryan said :
Huron "is dependent - upon agriculture
directly and indirectly. -â  Mr. McKinley said in
1890, in the report which accompanied his
tariff bill, that agriculture whs depressed and
that there could be no general prosperity in
this country, so Ion? as the farmer was not
prosperous. The only remedy which the Re
publicans now propose to better the condition
of the farmer is rariff. If tariff fails for
thirty years to prevent depression, what
reason have farmers to hope that it will be
more successful now? [Cheers.] There is a
cause which lies deeper than any system of
taxation. So long as the cold standard pre
vails there must be a general fall in the prices
of agricultural products whether we have a
high tariff or a low tariff, and so long as the
farm products are falling in value mere must
be hard times among the farmers, and the
farmers cannot suffer without bringing in suf
fering to the . other classes, which are de
pendent indirectly upon the farmer for pros
perity. [Cheers.] "

MASS-MEETING OF DEMOCRATS.
The]/ Are Anoeioua to Hear Teller, but
Be HrfuseÂ» to Talk.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 9.â mass-meet
ing of Democrats was held this afternoon
at Tattersall's. On account of the Chicago
parade down town the attendance was
slim. About 4000 people in all were pres
ent. Senator Henry ;M. Teller i was .; an
nounced to speak at the meeting : and > the
crowd evinced great disappointment when
informed that the Senator would be un
able to speak. When Mr. Teller arrived
cheer after cheer wen t ". up, â  ; hats â¢were
thrown in the air and the uproar, was
tremendous. The i. gentleman â called 't for
showed himself, but not a word would be
utter. Three times it was necessary ;to as
sure the audience that Mr. Teller could
not speak above a whisper before quiet
could be restored ] and ; Senator Frank J.
Cannon of Utah was introduced.
Senator Cannon made an appealing
speech, which met with loud applause
from his hearers. He took for his text
words from Major McKinley, in which the
Republican candidate called upon the men
to obliterate party lines and ;vote for the
good of the people. Cannon reiterated
these sentiments and then referred to hav
ing to leave the Republican party. "I
never thought," he said, "that I would
ever vote a Democratic ticket, but in this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1896.
campaign I will be forced to, as the Repub
lican party for the first time has gone back
on tho principles they have always before
advocated."
The speaker then referred to the mag
njficent parade he had just witnessed
downtown and in sarcastic terms expressed
his belief that many of the marchers wero
in the procession not from choice but be
cause they are slaves to their employers.
Senator Cannon in speaking of the Chi
cago convention said be thanked God that
the Democratic party had the honesty to
stand by its conviction, and that a man
had been nominated by them who was too
poor to buy even a delesate, and one who
could win more votes with his voice than
Mark Hanna can with his money. Mr.
Cannon's efforts were directed mainly at
the sympathies of his hearers and aimed
at his "rich opponent." He closed by
pledging his vote to William J. Bryan.
As soon as the speaker hud finished cries
of "Teller" were again heard and once
more Mr. Teller came to the front of the
platform, but did not say a word.
H. F. Bartine, editor of the Bimetallism
was next introduced and spoke as follows:
I nm opposed to the candidates of the Re
publican party because upon the greatest â
practically the onlyâ issue before us that party
nas ceased to bo Republican as I understand
the term. Contrary to all its past history and
tradition, for the first time since it was born
the Republican pariy has openly declared in
favor of the gold standard and has laid down
in thÂ° awiul shadow of the money power of
Europe and America. By history and tradi
tion ft was always a bimetallic party, pledged
to maintain the gold and silver money of the
constitution until Us independence and its
Americanism were strangled to death in St.
Louis on the Gth day of last June. The power
that holds the purse-strings of the world has
turned ai its mercy. The power to-day is Lon
don, and London will continue to be that
power so long as the gold standard Is main
tained.
The financiers of England understand this
perfectly well. Running all through the testi
mony of the gold-st&ndurd advocates who
made the statements before the international
commission of 1886-87 was the idea that the
restoration of silver would injure Rngland as
a creditor nation and deprive London of its
present position as the world's financial cen
ter.
Mr. Gladstone also understands It well. In
the most explicit terms he has declared that
England is a creditor to the extent of $10,000.
--000,000, and that the restoration of bimetal
lism would reduce the value of the money
which she controls. What did he mean by
that? Was he afraid of England being paul in
silver? Not at all. He knew that under inter
national bimetallism gold and silver would be
of equal value at the ratio agreed upon, but he
also knew that the restoration of silver would
make the gold itself cheaper.
li that be true, then the demonetization of
silver made gold dearer and gave England an
advantage that does not belong to her by any
principle of justice and fair-dealing. And
this is nut the worst of It. The declaration is
made with a full knowledge that the restora
tion of bimetallism would be for the best in
terests of the country. As Mr. Bryan has said,
the promise to promote an international
agreement is itself an admission that there is
something wrong with the gold standard.
fco tne position of the Republican party is
simply this: It admits that bimetallism will
be for the best interests of the country, but at
the same time makes the humiliating plea
that we can do nothing for our own good
without the permission aud aid of a country
whose interests are directly opposed to our
own. But even this does not tell the whole
story.
Wneu the St. Louis Republican convention
met not more than one-iounh of its members
were actually and avowedly lor the gold stand
ard. More than three-fourths were strongly
for bimetallismâ or, at least, they claimed to
be. And yet three-fourths lay meekly down
and allowed the one-fourth representing the
English idea in American politics to bind
them hand and foot with the chains of gold.
After another prolonged call for Teller,
and more excuses for his not speaking.
Chairman Hartman of Montana took the
stand.
He, too, opened with his reasons for de
serting the Republican lines, and said the
St. Louis plattorm was in direct opposi
tion to the one adopted at Minneapolis.
He denounced the St. Louis platform as
un-American, unpatriotic and disgusting
in the extreme. He then referred to the
"gold" parade, and stated as his belief
that a large number of men were march
ing under implied threat that if they did
not march on the 9tti they would* have to
march on the 10th. Mr. Hartman said he
was for protection, but that protection
would not protect with a gold standard.
He referred to a recent speech oi Joseph
Dobson in support of bis claim that manu
facturers in favor of a gold standard could
not compete with those under a silver
'standard. He referred in scathing terms
to the sale of Government bonds at 104
which lidtiaimed were worth 119 at the
time, and intimated that there must have
been something crooked in the transaction.
Announcement was made that speakers
ha 1 been employed to start in during tbe
coming week to make speeches in favor of
iree silver.
A mass-meeting of silver forces was
held at Tattersall's this evening which in
point of attendance and enthusiasm com
pared favorably with any held during this
camuaiga in Chicago.
Congressman Towne reviewed the de
nunie izatioii of silver, saying that tbe
effect was to take away from silver the
large demand that had existed lor it
from the beginning of tbe world, for
money purposes, and to place the entire
bnrden on gold.
Whether you take from silver or gold a
portion of the power of either it increases
the purchasing power oi the other metal;
id other words it takes more goods or
morejproperty to get possession of a dollar.
When you; trade two commodities each
buys the other. When, therefore, a dollar
increases the purchasing power it is
equivalent to saying it takes more product
to buy that dollar.
He declared that great as was the con
test of 1860 he beiieved the present struggle
was far greater; where that affected a, lew
million blacks this affected the destinies
oi 70,000,000 people, botn white and black.
A periect siorm of applause marked tbe
close' of Mr. Towne's speech, and three
vigorous cheers were given him.
Ex-Governor Hardin of Kentucky was
next introduced. Reference being made
as to Mr. Carlisle being from the same
State was greeted with hisses. Mr. Hardin
complimented Mr. Towne on his elo
quence, and he then gave numerous illus
trations of the law of supply and demand
and declared that the country was suffer
ing irom tbe under production of money.
He referred sarcastically to the cry of
"lack of confidence" and. said that prop
erty is not as low as it will go. References
to Cleveland and Carlisle brought out
vigorous hisses. Colonel Eddy of Colo
rado also made a stirring address, as did
Beveral other prominent speakers.
J>etnoeratM Carry Watson's Diatriot,
ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. ftâ Official returns
show that the Democratic majority for
the State ticket will run over 50,000. At
kinson's majority falls below this by sev
eral thousand, but this fact is due to the
local fight on the head of the ticket. One
notable feature is the fact that Democrats
have carried the Tenth Districtâ Watson's
district â which is the closest in the State.
Hint's Jiulr.M Adopted.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. ftâ The
final session of the annual convention of
the National Association of Life Under
writers was held to-day. Mr. Dyon of
Nebraska presented a copy of "Reed's
Rules" to the president, and on nis mo
tion they were made the rules of the as
sociation. Mr. Reed has been chosen as
arbitrator by the leading companies of
the country, succeeding the late ex-Gov
ernor W. E. Russell of Massachusetts.
James W. Ganney, general agent of the
Provident Life Insurance Company at
Chicago, addressed the convention on the
"Loan Association." Mr. Ganney's ad
dress was well received and a vote of
thanks tendered for what was asserted to
be "the ablest paper ever read before the
association."
Dr. Pnttemon'a Shortage.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 9.-It is an
nounced that a shortage of between
$15,000 and $16,000 has been found in the
accounts of Dr. A. C. Patterson, assistant
physician in charge of St. Elizabeth's
Asylum. The deficit does not come out
the Government funds, but out of the
sums paid by private patients. Dr. Pat
terson and his friends will make good the
deficiency. For three months past Dr.
Patterson has been in Canada for his
health.
THOUSANDS CHEER
CHAUNCEY DEPEW
Great Crowds at the Big
Coliseum to Hear the
Orator.
Lays the Lash on Bryan for His
Peculiar Theories as to
Silver.
THAT GREAT "CRIME CF 73."
To Punish the "Criminals" the Ne
braska Candidate Must Unearth
Some Noted Men.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 9.â Fifteen thou
sand people crowded th*e Coliseum to
night and heard Chauncey M. De pew de
liver an address. Two or three thousand,
unable to gain admission, were turned
away. The doctor was escorted from the
Auditorium to 'lie Coliseum, a distance of
eight miles, by the McKiniey and Hobart
Bcycle Club and the employes of several
railroads. Mr. Depew was late in arriving,
and it was 9 o'clock before he apDearedon
the platform. He was greeted with cheer
ing which could not be checked for ten
minutes. The famous speaker was intro
duced by Elden C. DeWitt of the Mar
quette Club, under whose auspices the
meeting was held. In opening his address
Mr. Depew said:
This is the largest political gathering I have
ever seen. I wonder if any of you got away.
I witnessed today two processionfcâ oue of
them representing the business men, Intelli
gent laborers â American citizenship â aJI
matching for McKinley and sound money;
the other one, which we passed on the way
down, looked like Coxev's army after they had
reached Washington. [Cheers.]
Mr. Depew then continued in part as
follows:
Some years ago when I was working with
might an>l main lor the success of your un
eaualed World's Fair, Chicago adopted me.
As an adopted sou it is a pleasure to be present
in your city on Chicago day. Chicago is an
epitome of the United States. It is the con
centrated expression nf the life, the energy
and the development of the country. Chicago
was burned to the ground in 1871.
It took two years to readjust relations to the
business and credit of the country. Then
came the crime of 1873, by which silver was
demonetized and the United States went upon
a gold standard. Twenty-tbrue years have
passed and Chicago presents the most remark
able object lesson in finance in the history of
gold as a standard by which to measure all
other kinds of currency and all the product oi
the farm aud factory, of Drains and labor.
Mr. Depew then expressed his gratifica
tion at having had the bicyclists as an
escort, who, he said, are almost unnani
monsly in favor of McKinley, sound
money and prosperity. On all other ques
tions they may differ, but they cannot dif
fer on questions which affect the life or
honor ot the Nation. Continuing he said:
The three last elections were carried by
small majorities, but when the lunatics and
the cranks and experimentalists got possession
ot the convention at Chicago and drove out
nine-tenths o-f the experienced brains of the
organization, and wlien they made their alli
ance with the id. ot asylum at St. Louis the
isaiety of the country demanded that sane men,
without regtird to previous party affiliations,
should combine end save the honor and busi
ness of the Nation.
Referring to the "crime of 1873" he said
the criminals were Senator Stewart and
Senator Jones of Nevada. First, Bryan must
hang them; he must suspend upon the
same gallows every Jiving member of the
Congress of 1873, both in the Senate and
in tne House, because they all voted for
this bill.
He must go to Monticello and take out
the bones of Jefferson from their tomb
and hang them as an exhibit for his or
der of demonetization in 18WJ, to the Her
mitage for General Jackson's skeleton, to
Marshiield for Webster and to Ashland
for Clay, to South Carolina for Calhoun,
to Missouri for Benton and to Auburn for
William A. Stewart; for they, eitLer in
'34 or '53 or '73, spoke for or advised the
demonetization of silver. Continuing Dr.
Depew said:
The criminals nre all the Presidents, from
Jefferson to Garfieid; all the Cabinet officers,
from Hamilton to John A. Bates; all the
mighty men of debate, from Madison, Webster
and Clay to Lincoln aud Blame. And who are
their judges and executioners? This famous
spike team which is careering aud cavorting
about the country; the wild broncho of Ne
braska in the lead; the staid, slow-eaited,
cnurch-going, broken-winded Puritan nag
from Maine at the wheel, aud his mate, the
untamed colt from Georgia, trying not to pull
the wagon, but to kick the stuffing out oi the
Puritan.
We have absolute liberty in this country of
political freedom and religious toleration, end
so we must view with toleration the followers
of this new religion. When Columbus discov
ered America ten ounces of silver were equal
to one ounce of gold.
When the Pilgrim Fathers landed on Ply
mouth liock thirteen ounces of silver were
equal to one o; gold; when our forefathers had
driven the British Government and created a
free and independent republic they declared
that the standard of value was fifteen ounces
of silver to one of gold. When we ask Mr.
Bryan why he repudiated Columbus and the
Pilgrim Fathers and thÂ£ founders of the Ke
puDllc, why he proclaims that the Government
must say that sixteen ounces of silver are
equal in value and must be taken by the peo
ple as equal to one ounce of gold for the prod
ucts of their farms, the output of their fac
tories aud their labor, when we know that by
doing so he is only getting half value and a
fraudulent return to the farmer, the manufac
turer and the wage-earner, his answer Is:
"Times have changed since the Revolutionary
War, and I'm not George Washington."
Mr. Depew laid the hard times and panic
to the free- trade tariff and tampering with
the currency. The remedies he proposed
was to get out oi the woods and into the
roads that led to employment and mar
ket. The panic had thrown 90,000 railroad
men off the payroll. This in turn had cat
off the demand for other workers in fac
tories and shops. To restore the old con
ditions of prosperity Mr. Depew asserted
the necessity of restoring confidence and
assuring stability by the election of Mc-
Kinley and Hobart.
NORTON FOR SOUSD MONEY.
A.nd Bo Is Cleveland, but Be Will Sot
Participate in the Campaign.
CHICAGO, ill., Oct. ftâ J. Sterling
Morton, Secretary of Agriculture, ad
dressed an audience of 3000 in the audi
torium to-night, upon invitation of the
American Honest Money League.
The meeting was opened by E. B. Smith,
who read a letter which had been sent by
the league inviting President Cleveland to
make a gold speech in Chicago, and the
reply thereto. The President responded
by saying that, inasmuch as he was
anxious to do all in his power to aid the
league m its work, he regretted that he
would not be able to accept the invitation,
as his official duties would prevent, and,
in any case, he wonld hardly deem it con
sistent with strict propriety *to mingle
actively in the pending campaign.
"While it is impossible," he writes,
"that any of my fellow-citizens have the
least doubt as to my sentiments on the
vital question which at this date absorbs
largely the attention of the people, the
work of advancing sound financial ideas
and the labor of enforcing lessons of public
and private honesty and morality I feel
must be prosecuted without much partici
pation on my part as you suggest.
As soon as Mr. Smith had read the letter
he introduced David B. Jones, who acted
as chairman of the meeting. Mr. Jones,
after a few words as to the importanceÂ»of
the money question, turned to Mr. Morton
to proceed at once with his speech. He
said iv part:
Money is mereiy a measure of value and a
mediator of exchanges. The farmer demands
money for his staples because real, honest
money has a general purchasing power in all
the markets of the civilized globe. And that
money is real and honest and that money is
beÃt which has the least fluctuating purcnas
ing power at all times and in all countries. A
dollar with too much purchasing power is as
impossible as a square meal with too much
nutitrive power, an acre of land with too
much productive capacity or an advocate of
Populistic schemes of nuance with too much
logical ability. When humanity becomes too
good for heaven money ma/ become too good
for the industrious and capable farmers aad
wage-earners of America, but not before.
Unequal desire and demand for silver make
silver the inferior of rold in the arts and in
the currencies. Strip gold of the legal-tender
quality, and who would not then take for his
dues demonetized gold when the chance of
fered, instead 01 legal-tender silver? But if the
power exists in legislation to make two metals
equal as money, then the same power can
make silver and gold equal in the arts and
for jewelry. If the United States can double
the price of tlie world's silver by enactment,
why can it not also double the price of gar
neis or wheat or pork or any other exchang
able thing by the same necromancy? And how
can an international conference fix Iv goid
the price of silver? And, if agreement be
tween nations can maintain stable prices for
silver, why not for other commodities?
The question to-day is, Which shall farmers
and all good ciiizens of the United States
maintain and circulate, honest mouey or dis
honest money, good money or bad money ?
Farmers and all other sensible folk should de
mand when they buy money with their prod
ucts or services the Highest standard and
quality of money. And if gold and sliver are
to be coined freely and in unlimited quanti
ties by the United States, then equity and
honesty must insist that "any quantity of
either metal in the form of bullion must be of
exactly the same vaiue as the same quantity
of the same metal in the form of coin."
But it the unlimited and free coinage of
silver at the ilioeical and false ratio of 16 to 1
is to be instituted aud silver thus mft'ie a
legal tender at a mint and coin valne which Is
twice its bullion value this basic principle of
rightful coinage will have been abrogated
and dened. Under the operation 01 the
Gresham law Rold will disappear from the
channels cf American commerce and silver
will take its place. All that we sell foreigners
will be paid for in silver, and all that we buy
from them will be paid lor in gold, and we
also will pay the premium on that gold. In
short we will be monetarily Mexicanized, ond
no class will suffer co great a proportion of
the calamitous loss which this will cause as
American farmers.
TRAGEDY AT A FARMHOUSE
AH the Members of the Family
of Albert Bray Found With
Their Throats Cut.
Indications Are That It Ts a Case
of Wanton Murder and
Snicide.
NOBLESVILLE, Ikd., Oct. 9. â The
citizens of this town and the people of the
surrounding country are greatly excited
over tne new* of an awful tragedy which
took place three miles from here. The
bodies of Albert Bray, a prominent
farmer, bis wife and two children, were
found dead this morning in their home.
Their throats bad been cut, and all were
dead except Bray, who died soon after he
was found.
The neighbors are undecided whether
they were murdered by strangers or
whether Bray did the awful deed himself.
For some time t>ast the family had been
living very quietly at their home. They
seemed happy and Bray was apparently
devoted to nis wife. He always went out
with her and seemed to do all he could
for her. On several occasions, however, he
acted very queerly, and it began to be
whispered around that he was not quite
right in his head. Frequently he would
meet neighbors on tne publio highway
and would pass them without a word of
salutation. He never said or did any
thing, however, which gav6 tne least indi
cation that he contemplated the norriblo
butchery which came to light to-day.
Early this morning a neighbor who
wished to borrow a plow called at the Bray
house. He knocked, but received no an
swer. Going around to the Dack door he
found that it was shut, and there were no
signs of life in the house. He was greatly
surprised at this, as he knew that the
Brays were early risers, and their usual
time for getting up had long since passed.
He finally decided something was wrong
in the house, and putting his shoulder to
the back door he forced his way in. He
saw no indications of anything being
wrong until he reached the bedroom.
There an awful sisrht met his eyes. Lying
on the floor were the bodies of Mrs. Bray
and the two children, aged 3 and 6 re
spectively. Their throats had been cut.
Near by "was the prostrate form of Bray,
whose throat had also been cut. He was
still alive, but unconscious. At his side
was a bloody razor.
The neighbors tried to revive Bray, but
in vain. Bray died shortly after he was
found.
The officers were notified of the tragedy
and are working hard to find possible
clews to the murderer, though it is gener
ally believed that Bray himself committed
the deed in an insane moment.
TRANSFERS HIS PROPERTY.
Oscar Bnmtneratein Prepares to Avoid
Paying Heavy Datnaf/ea.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 9.â The Herald
says this morning : Oscar Haramerstein
yesterday afternoon transferred a private
house belonging to him in Harlem to his
wife. Earlier in the week he leased the
Harlem Opera-house and the Columbia
Theater to two of his sons. "When Ham
merstein was asked last night about the
significance of these transactions he
smiled.
"Well," said he, "damage suits against
me growing out of the boiler explosion
that" occurred at the Olympia the day
after it opened last autumn, when two
persons were killed and others injured,
for nearly $150,000 will soon come up for
trial. I have made the transfer of real
estate you refer to and have leased my
theaters to my sons. You may draw your
own inference.
"As far as these transactions signifying
that I am preparing for any bisr financial
crash, let me tell you that my total float
ing indebtedness to-day at all my the
aters â Olympia, Harlem Opera-House and
Columbus â will not amount to much
more than $50,000. That covers all un
paid bills and 1 have property enough to
cover that three or four times over. That
does not look very much like a failure,
does it?"
The Olympia opened on November 26
last. The next morning a foed-pipe in the
steam-heating apparatna burst and two
men were killed and eight men were se
verely injured.
BIFFT PIRATERS GROW BOLD.
They Board a French Ship, Pinion the
Crete and Plunder the Vessel.
MADRID, Spain., Oct. 9.â News has
been received by the Government that the
Riffl pirates are again committing depre
dations upon passing vessels and have
become bolder than ever. A strong band
of Riffi boarded the French ship Corinte
off Anthucema, and after pinioning the
crew plundered the ship's cargo. The
Spanish steamer Saviila, conveying Cuban
exiles to Ceuta appeared on the scene and
fared on the pirates. The fire was returned
and a fight begun which lasted some time.
Four men on board the Sevilla were killed,
including a Cuban prisoner named Oscar.
The pirates finally retired, but carried off
the captain of the Corinte. A Spanish
war ship has gone in search of the pirates.
DESPERADO SAIR
KILLS HIMSELF
During His Flight He Slays
an Officer and Is
Wounded.
Overtaken by the Pursuers He
Puts a Bullet in His
Own Head.
BLOODY SIQTJEL TO A ROBBERY
Many Bicyclists Held for Identification
anl the S?cond Desperado Is
Probably in Custody.
WELLS, Minn., Oct. 9.â John D. Sair,
who no doubt engineered the robbery at
Sherbume Wednesday, is dead, as is also
Marshal Gallien of Bancroft, lowa.
This tragic sequel to the Martin County
tragedy and bank robbery came a Jew
minutes after 9 o'clock this morning in a
bloody battle on the State line road near
Elonore, Minn. A posse of 100 men in
command of Deputy Sheriff Ward of Mar
tin County got on the trail of Sair shortly
after daylight and tracked him to a farm
house. Deputy Ward knocked at the door
and was answered by a woman, but be
fore she had spoken three words Sair
rushed up behind her and beean firing
over her shoulder at the officers. He
fired seven times in quick succession. One
of the bullets struck Marshal Gallien in
the forehead and killed him instantly.
Tbe desperado then ran out of the house
by way of the back door, mounted his bi
cycle and dashed off toward the east. The
posse caught sight of him and followed
close behind. This chase was kept up for
four miles, when Sair broke a pedal on his
wheel and took to the fields on foot.
As he ran across a cornfield toward a
clump of trees Deputy Sheriff Ward
clashed up, dismounted and resting his
gun upon a tree fired, the shot from his
Winchester taking effect in the robber's
shoulder. The latter fell, it was supposed
from the shot from Ward's gun, but when
the posse gathered around him it was
found he had shot himself in the head,
the shoulder wound only being a slight
one. Upon examining the body tbe offi
cers found a portion of the money stolen
at Sherbume in an inside pocket of his
shirt, the amount being about $600. Fas
tened to a belt around his body were two
revolvers and a dirk knife.
The body was taken to Elonoro at noon
and thence west to Sberburne later. Tbe
Coroner's inquest has adjourned until
Monday without finding a verdict. The
body of the dead Marshal was taken to
Bancroft, lowa, to-night. Bicyclists are
being held for identification at Preston,
Blooming Prairie and Estherville, lowa.
The man captured at the last named
place best answers the description of the
other robber, Fred Pratt, and he will be
held until officers can reach Estherviile
from Wilder, Minn., Pratfs home.

"Onion Veterans' Patriotic League of
Cleveland, and were escorted to the Taber
nacle, where an elaborate dinner was
served by the women of the city. After
dinner they marched to Major McKinley's
house. Scores of the ex-Confederate
soldiers walked arm-in-arm with the
Union veteransâ gray uniforms and blr\e
were mingled in the parade.
Along the line of march the veterans
were cheered at every step, and they made
a brave spectacle as they swung up the
broad street and passed under the white
arch at the foot of the hill leading to the
McKinley residence, just at sunset. The
last rays of the sun gleamed in the faces
of the men who had faced each other as
foes in deady battle, and those same rays
fell upon and glorified forty American
flags, which waved above them as they
marched and to which they are equally
loyal and devoted. It was an impressive
sight. At Major McKinley's house the
reception given the visitors was most cor
dial. Flags and handkerchiefs fluttered
from every window, and Mrs. McKinley,
ieaning out on the sill from a second-story
window, waved a small silken banner.
The 2000 spectators on the streets lifted
their voices in a chorus of cheers, and
then from the great delegation of South
erners rose a storm of hurrahs â the old
rebel yell transformed into a patriotic
cheer.
The cheering when Major McKinley ap
peared on the stand was prolonged and
vehement The speakers in behalf of the
delegation of Confederates were A. P.
Funkhousar, editor of a paper at Harris
ton ourg, Va., and General G. E. Roller.
Major McKinley said:
My fellow-citizens: I welcome to my home
the representatives of a State of proud ances
tral memories [great cheering], the State of
Washington [applause], the President of the
country which framed the Federal constitu
tion, and the first and foremost President of
the United States; the State of Jefferson, the
author of the Declaration of Independence
[great applause and "Hnrrah for McKinley"],
and which lighted the torch of liberty that has
girdled the globe; the State of Madison, the
expounder of the Federal constitution, and
the State of Monroe, who promulgated the
great doctrine that prevents European Inter
ference in this hemisphere; the State was
generous in the concessions of territory that
gave Ohio to the Federal Union. [Loud cheer

Patriotism Is not bounled by State or clflS3
or sectional lines. We are a reunited coun
try. [Cries of "Yes. yes; that's what we are,
and tremendous applause.] We have but one
flag, the glorious old stars and stripes [tre
mendous yelling], which all of us love so weil,
and that we mean to transmit in honor and
glory to our children, North and South. Sec
tionalism was surrendered at Appomattox
[applause], and the years that have followed
have removed whatever lingering resistance
that remained. Indeed, if anything was needed
to utterly and effectually destroy it, it has
been furnished in the events of the contest
now upon us for the honor of the American
name and that permanent peace vhich was
the dying prayer of the great captain of our
armies, Uiysses S. Grant. [Vociferous cheer
ing.) The spirit of the fervent Americanism
is abroad in the land, and not more earnest
is the sentiment in the North than the senti
ment in the South.
This year the words of your veterans' le
gion borne on your breasts to-day, "No North,
no South, no .East, no West, the Union For
ever," sounds torth like a bugle note calling
patriots together, and is an expression of the
purpose of the American people both North
and South [tremendous applause] pro
claiming liberty, union and honor as the high
aim of every survivor of that great war on
either side and of every patriot in the country.
The inspiring and unconquerable sentiment of
this campaign isâ Country first, country last
and country with stainless honor all the time.
[Cries of "Good l Good!" and great cheering.]
The voice of the misguided partisan is not
heeded; the voice of patriotism strikes a re
sponsive chord this year. The voice of preju
dice and hate is lost in the grand chorus of
peace and good will. National unity and
National integrity. [Great applause.] No
stronger evidence, no higher testimony ig re
quired to prove that sectional lines are oblit
erated and that the war has long been over
than the presence In Canton to-day of this
large assemblage of ex-Confederate soldiers,
traveling from the Valley of the Shenandoah
in Virginia, which marked the bloody path
way of the war, to testify their devotion to
the unbroken and never to be broken Union
[rtemendous applause] and their purpose to
hold its credit and honor forever.
Their presence here betokens a new depart
ure. It is an inspiring and uplifting scene. It
lifts us above the plane of mere partisanship.
The soldiers who fought against you are also
here to give you hearty and hospitable wel
come, marching side by side with you under
the same flag. [Long and continued applause.]
No longer have they arms in their hands, but
love and respect ior each other in their hearts.
(Cries of "Good, good."] It is a glorions exam
ple of patriotic devotion which might well be
emulated by some people both in the North
and in the South, few oi them happily there
are, who would benefit by fanning the flames
of passion and prejudice by arraying one por
tion of our country against the other. [Cries
of "That's right," and great applause.]
It is peculiarly a matter of gratification to
me also that In my home city and from the
neighboring city of Cleveland, my old com
rades of the war, with whom I fought, on the
other side from you in that great conflict have
given you warm welcome and will tender you
hospitality while here and give you their love
and benediction to carry away with you when
you go. [Continued cheering.]
Men of the South, the only force now needed
in this free Government is that of conscience,
justice, reason and intelligence. [Great ap
plause.] This is the irresistible power upon
which resta our strength, security, perma
nency and glory. We have entered upon a
new and blessed eraâ we have crossed the do
minion of force into the kingdom of peace
and law and mutual good will. [Applause.]
I thank your orators for their generous words
of assurance in your behalf.
Let us remember now and in all the future
that we are Americans, and that what is good
for Ohio is good for Virginia. [Continuous ap
plause and three cheers for McKinley and Ho
bart.]
Major McKinley was given the most
earnest attention and was cheered vocifer
ously by his auditors. Tne ex-Confederate
Veterans left Canton at midnight and
were escorted to Plttsburg by a committee
from the Americus Club of that city.
Major McKinley will receive twenty-five
delegations Saturday. He will he assisted
in srjeeciimaking by Charles L. Boutelle of
Maine. â¢*

ITS PROSPERITY
Twenty-Five Years After
the Big Fire a Day of
Celebration.
Nearly One Hundred Thousand
Persons Participate in
the Procession.
ALL TEADES FOR SGTJND MON
With Flaming Torch and Stirring
Music Bryan Supporters Hold an
Evening Demonstration.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct 9.â Twenty-five
years ago to-day the city of Chicago was
laid waste by the most disastrous fire that
has ever wrought destruction in an Anv.ri
can city. To-day, in commemoration of
that day of dreadful havoc and suffering,
a magnificent metropolis, so far exceeding
the oid city in wealth, beauty and popula
tion that comparisons are useless, if not
utterly impossible, celebrated the rebuild
ing and progress of what is now the second
city in America.
The anniversary was taken advantage of
by local managers of the Presidential
campaign to make a demonstration in !
advocacy of the present financial system,
Republicans and gold Democrats joining '
forces under the direction of the Business
Men's Club in a parade, the equal of which
has never been seen in this city.
As a counter demoustration the free
silver forces to-night had a torchlight
parade. Probably in the nistory of Chi- j
cago there never has been such a number
of people congregated on its streets. The
sidewalks aiong the entire route of the
parade were a congested mass of humanity,
which was with great difficulty kept from
blocking the streets by the constant ac
tivity of an immense detail of police. Not
a streetcar was allowed to cross the river
from the North or West sides, nor were
any Southside cars permitted to evade
the district set apart for the paraders.
Every bridge was closed to vehicles and
all traffic on downtown streets suspended.
Banners and flags were swung at fre
quent intervals across the streets and from
every balcony others floated. Many of
the show windows also were elaborately
decorated in honor of the occasion.
Above the masses of people, above even
the sk-yscrapins office buildings, rose a
mighty roar â cheers, yells, music of in
numerable bands, the tooting of horns,
little and big, the penetrating bellowing of
immense megaphones and the thousand
and one other noises that mark the pass
ing of a great political parade.
At two or three points along the line of
march immense open-mouthed telephone
receivers were attached to wires leading"
directly to the homes of William McKinley
and Garret A. Hobart and to various
Eastern cities, into which were announced
the names of each organization as the |
great column passed, and then a mighty I
shout would go up that could be heard
miles away.
Observation stands had been erected at
frequent intervals, and not only were these
filled to their utmost capacity, but every
building had its throngs of spectators,
filling its windows, some tenants even
rentintr seats in desirable windows for a
half dollar apiece.
Many distinguished people from outside
the city witnessed the parade, among
them being Hon. Mark Hanna, who
reached the city yesterday and who, in
company with tne members of tbe Repub
lican campaign committee, viewed the
sights from tfte Union League Club, where
the party took lunch, and Generals Palmer i
and Buckner, the anti-silver candidates, j
who watchea the parade from h stand in
front of the Palmer House. Hon. Chaun
cey M. Depew and Secretary of Agricul
ture Morton were also interested specta
tors, as were (from adiffernt Dointof view)
Senators Teller, Pettigrew and Dubois and
Congressman Towne
Promptly at 10 o'clock a cannon at the
Late Front ParK gave the signal for the
Darade to move. Immediately General
Joseph Stockton, who had charge of the
vast army of volunteers representing
almost every branch of industry in the
city, gave the order to march, and Mayor
Swift, Chief of Police Badenoch, Assistant
Chief Ross, Inspectors Bonfield and Shea,
at the head of a platoon of police, led the
great host of industrial workers and politi
cal clubs on their triumphal tour of tbe
business portion of tbe city.
One trade alone dad 10,000 representa
tives in line. These were the men who
have in a few years crowded Chicago's
packing industries to the front until they
are among the foremost in the world.
Employe? of Armour <k Co., Nelson, Morris
& Co., Swift <fe Co. and other houses of
world-wide reputation made a mighty
regiment, separated into companies by
the many floats they had prepared.
Mounted on their wiry and supple mus
tangs and wearing white sombrero hats,
the cattle buyers, drovers and other em
ployes oi the Union Stockyards created
wild enthusiasm wherever they rode.
There was something like a thousand of
these mounted cattlemen, and they were
all bronzed and sturdy looking men whose
easy riding was a contrast to that of some
of the men woo headed the downtown
divisions.
For the most part the parade was com
posed of marchers, for the number of peo
ple participating made this a necessity,
otherwise the line of march would have
been so long that it would have been im
possible to handle it. There was one no
table exception to this rule, and that was
in tne case of the older veterans of the
Civil War, who had been especially solicited
to join the parade, and they were all pro
vide! with carnages.
They rode through the ranks of people,
and more than once a comrade on the
sidewalk recognized a familiar face in the
carriages, and would set up a cheer that
was taken up by the crowd and swelled to
a mighty roar of tribute to the grizzled
defenders of the Nation.
As the procession, with its platoon of
blue coats and brass buttons at the head,
moved slowly along the streets it was pre
ceded by a welcoming roar from the
blocks of spectators that lined the road
way. The floats, and they were legion,
roused enthusiasm and were greeted by
cheers of admiration all along the line.
One of the mest generally admired of
these creations was that of the iron and
sieel trades, which was gotten up in bar
baric style, with a figure representing Vul
can sitting on an anvil.
The rear guard of the partfde reached
the dispersing point at 4 o'clock, the spec
tacle listing six hours- Between 75,000
I and 100,000 people participated in the line
L of march.
Before the echo of the applause of the
multitudes that witnessed the demonstra
tion for sound money and protection had
died out the organized followers of Bryan
from every quarter of the city, and almost
in as great numbers, marched, with flam
ing torch, to stirring music poured forth
by a score of bands, over very nearly the
same route followed by their political op
ponents during the day. Red fire and
searchlights added to the attractiveness of
the parade, and lent their assistance in
stirring up the enthusiasm of spectators,
who looked on from every position of van
tage along the line of march.
The balcony of tbe Auditorium annex
was the reviewing stand for the free-*iver
parade, and from it Vice-Preside nt Stev
enson, United States Senator Henry M.
Teller and many other noted Demo
crats reviewed the marching followers of
Bryan and Sewall as they passed.
The parade left the Columbus statue on
the lake front at Bp. M. The line of march
was along Michigan avenue to Ran
dolph street, then west to Fifth avenue, to
Jackson street, east to Michigan avenue,
and thence to Tattersall's where the
speeches for the occasion were delivered.
Major Edgar B. Tolmer was the chief
marshal, and the parade was held under
the auspices of the United Silver clubs of
Cook County. The parade, which con
sisted of six divisions, was led by a
cavalry brigade. Then came the Cook
County Democracy, followed by clubs
from South Side wards and towns. This
c mstituted the first division, and was in
charge of Marshal William J. O'Brien.
Marshal Joseph Daze was in charge of
the second division, which consisted of
the Carter and Harrison Association and
the trades and labor unions. All clubs
and organizations from North Side wards
made up the third division, and Marshal
James A. Brachtendorf was in command.
German organizations formed the fourth
division. The fifth division consisted of
all West Side organizations, and the sixth
and last division included all unassigned
organizations, bicycle clubs and members
of American Railway unions.
The demonstration in point of numbers
and enthusiasm was a grand success. The
streets through which the procession
passed were crowded wit spectators, and
they cheered the marching hosts wildly.
As to display, the procession was
scarcely as gorgeous as that of the gold
advocates in the daytime, but this waÂ«
not unexpected, as the silver people gave
it out eaWy in the week that they would
attempt nothing in the way of spectacular
effects. The bannere as a rule were of an
impromptu order and many of the mot
toes were trite in their application and
were wildly chnered at all points, one in
particular bearing the inscription, "No
buzzards are watching," caught tne
crowds on the sidewalk, wjio perceived
the point conveyed.
A very pretty sight was a float on which
were seated seventeen young ladies, of
whom sixteen were dressed in white with
silver ornaments and one decked with
gold. The significance of this created tin
bounded enthusiasm. The young ladies
responded to the applause by waving
American flags.
Bryan lithographs in profusion were
noticeable, and cries ot "What's the
matter with Bryan?" "He's all right,"
rebounded on all sides. About fifty bands,
each of which discoursed patriotic and
martial music, were in attendance.
Scarcely a man in the parade but had a
horn or instrument of some kind to add
to the noise of tbe occasion.
No time was lost in the movement of
the immense body, a double quick step
being the order. Over 30,000 men were in
line, the north and south divisions
moving first, the west side contingent
joining in when the rear of the first two
reached Randolph and Market streets.
A conservative estimate put the number
of people on the down streets at 600,000.
INJURED ON THE STREETS.
Ambulances Kept Busy Conveying Men
and Women to Hospitals.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 9.â The mammoth
parades which have just been finished in
this city were two of the best-conducted
affairs of the kind ever held here. While
there were a number of small -accidents
they were unavoidable and no fatalities
are reported. The police ambulances
were kept busy, however, carrying men
and women who had fainted on the streets
and removing those injured in one way
and another. About thirty criminals
were arrested, being mostly pickpockets.
Among those injured during the day
were: Lawrence French, struck by an
electric car, skull fractured ; Mrs. and Miss
Murdock, scalp wounds from being
knocked over by electric cars; John
Schummels, pushed off car, head injured;
Eli Bathwick, fell off ladder while watch
ing parade and broke left leg; Andrew
O'Hearn, run over by mail wagon, taken
to hospital; Michael Cahill, left knee-cap
broken; Tom Maguire, ear badly lacerated
by being stepped on; L. If. Fagonette,
right eye severely injured by a cane.
A crowd of McKinley men took posses
sion of a Bryan speaker and lifted him
j bodily and threw him into tbe river. But
| for the fact that a tug was passing at tbe
: time the man might have been drowned.
He was hauled out and went away with
his clothing drippin.*.
MINES GRADUALLY RESUMING.
Militia Escort and Protect the Men Im
ported to Work in the Leadville
District.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Oct. 9.â The big
mines are gradually resuming. New men
are applying for work almost daily. Quite
a number are straggling in here in twos
and threes from outside towns, and 108
men were brought from Joplin, Mo., tnis
afternoon. They were met four miles be
low Leadville by a company of citizen
soldiers, who escorted them into the city,
where they were met by 200 infantry,
twenty-five cavalrymen and two artillery
pieces and escorted to the little Johnny
mine in safety. The Johnny has now 175
men and will resume work to-morrow.
Quite a crowd followed the men and
soldiers up to the mills, but very little dis
position to provoke trouble was manifested.
One striker cursed a soldier, who struck
him on the head with the butt of his gun.
After this no more interference occurred.
It was snowing and turning cold when the
men arrived, but the troops willingly
obeyed orders and walked from the depot
to the little Johnny Mine in slush and
snow, a distance of four miles.
Cornelius McHu^h was bound over to
his preliminary hearing in the sum of
$1000. He was tne leading gunsmith here
and it is charged that he secured guns for
the strikers.

NO LONGER A BLAGSHIP
The Charleston to Be Altered to a Single
Command Cruiser.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 9.â The flag
ship Charleston is to be altered to a single
command cruiser at the navy-yard, Mare
Island, Cal. This decision was had by the
Board of Naval Bureau this afternoon
without a dissenting vote. The vessel will
also be put in thorough repair, after seven
years of the most arduous services of any
ship in the new navy, the work requiring
eight months' time and an expenditure of
$200,000. The Charleston has been the
smallest flagship in the navy. She was
fitted with admiral's quarters because at
the time of her construction so few vessels
were available for that duty.
Now, however, about 65 ncr cent of her
berth was taken up for officers' quarters,
and her crew space was badly cramped.
The changes now ordered will rerue.ly
this defect and give the sailors more
breathing and sleeping space. The
change is made possible by the fact that
there are three flagships on the Pacific,
and the new battie-ship No. 9 to be built
at San Francisco will have acco/nmoda
tions for an admiral. The Charleston has
bee.i continuously on the go since she was
commissioned, December 26, 1889. Besides
her chase after the Itata and her long run
to attend the naval review at Hampton
roads, she has steamed up ani down the
Pacific Coast of this continent several
times, made voyages to China and tours
to Hawaii during the exciting times there.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1896.
PECULIAR CASE
Of THE CASTLE:
Denied Bail, but Given Extra
Privileges in Hollo
way Jail.
Physicians Examine the Accused
Woman to Ascertain Her
Mental Condition.
KLEPTOMANIA THE DEFENSE.
Diplomats and Business Men Unite
in Trying to Clear the Ac
cused Couple.
LONDON, Enq., Oct. 9.â Physicians hare
examined Mrs. Castle since her incarcera
tion in Holloway Jail with a view of ascer
taining her exact mental condition, and
their examination has resulted in the de
termination to support the delense in
obtaining the services of special experts to
appear at the hearing of the case of the
lady and her Husband, which will come
up next Tuesday. The lawyers retained
have not yet been successful in their
efforts to obtain bail for their clients.
Hon. J. N. Roosevelt, Secretary of the
United States Embassy, will see Mr. and
Mrs. Castle in Holloway Jail this after
noon and will afterward nave a conference
with the lawyers of the accused in regard
to the procuring of bail for their release
pending trial. It is not lifcely, however,
that an application for their admission to
bail will be made until the defendants are
again brought into court, which will be
on Tuesday, October 13. Mr. and Mrs.
Castle are being made as comfortable as
possible during their detention in jail.
The authorities permit them to wear
their ordinary clothes and to provide
their own food. In addition to these
privileges Mr. Castle and nis wife have
been provided with better rooms than
prisoners are usually permitted to occupy.
Mrs. Castle is very much depressed, and
the American Embassy will make especial
efforts to obtain bail for her, if their en
deavors to secure the release of both her
self and husband unaer bonds should be
successful. United States Consul-General
Patrick A. Collins, L. E. Lathrop, United
States Consul at Bristol, and a large num
ber of Liverpool and London merchants
have signified their willingness to vouch
for the good character of Mr. Castle.
Colonel McFarlane, the agent in Liver
pool of tne sugar firm of the Spreckelses of
San Francisco, and Mr. McNair, a promi
nent merchant at Liverpool, came to Lon
don yesterday, traveling in a special
train, for the purpose of assisting.
Mr. Roosevelt in his interview with the
officials in behalf of the Castles. The in
terview was held, but the officials said
that at the present stage of the case they
were unable to act.
Magistrate Newton of the Great Marl
borough-street Police Court, before whom
Mr. and Mrs. Castle were arraigned, was
next applied to, but he informed his
callers that under the law he could only
hear applications for bail in open court.
It is now understood that the police are in
possession of additional evidence against
Mrs. Castle but nothing against Mr. Castle.
It is generally believed that the defense
will plead kleptomania on the part of Mrs.
Castle, and it is with this view that the
lady has been examined by medical ex
perts.
When Mr. Roosevelt, first secretary of
the United States Embassy, saw Mr. and
Mrs. Castle in Holloway Jail to-day he was
accompanied by Mr. Hodson. Mr. Castle
showed signs of the deepest depression
and when he started to speak to Mr.
Roosevelt he broke down completely and
cried like a child. He exclaimed: 'We
are both innocent. I hope my mother in
San Francisco will not hear of this as it
will kill her if she does."
Mr. Roosevelt says that he left the prison
convinced that if any man is innocent
Mr. Castle is. He added that he can only
think the wife is not in her right mind.
Police Inspector Arrow said to-day : "I
am sorry for the man, but I cannot under
stand why he did not know there was so
much plunder in his wife's possession.
Knowing of his wealth I have advised
against the prisoner being admitted to
bail."
CHINA SILK THIS WINNER.

LEXINGTON, &Y., Oct. 9.â The Ken
tucky, suburban for two-year-olds was the

the second heat in 2:16^, which is next to
the best two-year-old race of the 'season.

GRAND CRICKET PLATING.
Play Resumed in the Australia- All Chi-
eago Series.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct 9.â Play in the
Australia-All Chicago cricket game was
resumed on the Wanderers' grounds this
morning in beautiful weather. The at
tendance was the largest ever seen at a
cricket game in Chicago, a number of the
spectators coming from other towns.
Gregory and Darling, the not-outs, re
sumed their inning at 11:30 o'clock, Hen
derson and Wilmot naving charge of the
attack. Darling made a three and com
pleted his half century, but was bowled
out by Wilmot in his second over.
Gregory returned an easy catch to Hen
derson, and half the wickets were down
for 74. Kellv, after being missed from a
hot drive to Wilmot, was well caught at
long by Captain Anson. Trott and Giffen
stayed together until the luncheon inter
val and on resuming the former made
some big hits, but eventually sent one to
Pfeffer, who made a splendid eaten.
Graham and Giffen gave a pretty exhi
bition while together and stole a number
of short runs. The former jumped in to
drive Howell and was bowled. McKibben
staved for a time and was out with a total
of 235.
Giffen carried out his bat for a fine
inning of 69. The other scores were:
Kelly 6, Gregory 4, Trott 36, Eady 9, Gra
ham 27, McKibben 9, with 7 extras. The
total was 225 or a lead of 130 runs.
Chicago went in again and lost eight
wickets for 53 runs, so that they need 77
runs to save a single inning's defeat.
Eady and McKibben were destructive, the
former getting four wickets for 24 and trie
latter four for 21.
Tbe game will be finished to-morrow,
the Australians leaving in the evening for
San Francisco.

The Ex- Premier Discusses the
Remedies for Settling the
Turkish Question.
DISAGREES WITH GLADSTONE.
Withdrawal of the British Embassa
dor From Constantinople Would
Lead to Humiliation.
EDINBURGH, Scotland, Oct. 9.â
Speaking in this city to-night Lord Rose
fcery, the ex- Premier, discussed the reme
dies that bad been suggested for the
settlement of the Turkish question. Re
garding the proposal that Russia should
take possession of Constantinople he said
that the late Government (his own) had
been extremely anxious to arrive at an
entente with Russia, and he was 3tili in
every way hopeful that a satisfactory un
derstanding between England and Russia
would be reached. Ho urged the advo
cates of the proposal, however, to remem
ber the treatment that had been accorded
the Poles by the Russians. Moreover, he
asKed, 'How is Great Britain to give to
Russia what is not hers?" Avowing
veneration and unaltered friendship for
Mr. Gladstone, Lord Rosebery said that
he could not agree with the proposal made
by the latter in his Liverpool speech to
withdraw the British Embassador from
Constantinople or to threaten action
which couli not be effected if the powers
did not approve.
Such a course would lead to humilia
tion. He differed with Mr. Gladstone in
the condition that England was bound by
the treaty to intervene in Turkey. This
had been a dead letter ever since it had
been signed. He did not desire especially
the retention of Cyprus and woutd will
ingly give it to any power except Turkey.
Lord Rosebery further declared that he
was especially opposed to isolated action
on the Turkish question. Such action
would mean a European war with the
slaughter of hundreds of thousands,
threaten the existence of Great Britain
and perhaps precede the enslavement of
the Armenians.
Any British Minister incurring a Euro
pean war, except through the direct neces
sity of interests distinctly British, would
be a criminal to his country and to his
position. Lord Roseberv then referred to
his retirement from the leadership of the
Liberal party, saying that the difference
of opinion on the Eastern question was
only one of a series of incidents that bad
induced him to resign. He added that he
bad not received the loyal support that a
peer needed, if he was to lead his party suc
cessfully. His government in its early
days had been defeated by its own fol
lowers. The policy he had suggested for
the election had not been adopted.
Finally Mr. Gladstone had innocently
administered the coup de grace. The in
ternal differences in the party bad beeu
equal to the external differences. His
action had been so hampered as to render
his position untenable.
Tne meeting unanimously adopted a
resolution expressing gratitude for the
manner in which Lord Rosebery had led
the party, deeply regretting his retire
ment and earnestly honing that be would
reconsider his action and resume the lead
ership. Lord Rosebery replied that his
decision was the result of mature reflec
tion and had been tauen with the convic
tion of its absolute necessity.
The clubs here to-night were filled with
members who eagerly awaited a report of
Lord Rosebery's speech at Edinburgh.
Tbe Central News was alive to the impor
tance of the occasion, and caused a col
umn of the speech to be put on the "tick
ers" concurrent with its delivery. The
report was devoured with avidity, and the
references to the reasons that caused Lord
Rosebery to throw up the leadership of
his party were excitedly discussed. A
great throng filled the National Liberal
Club, which presented the appearance it
does at the time of a great election.
The Daily News (Liberal) contends that
there is evidence of a rally to Lord Rose
bery, or rather a renewal of confidence in
him which his speech will strengthen.
The Chronicle, a Liberal paper, but op
posed to Lord Rosebery as a leader, at
tacks him bitterly, accusing him of total
indifference to the sufferings of the Ar
menians. His speech, the paper declares,
was evidently an attempt to discredit the
agitation in their support. It says that it
regrets that Lord Rosebery thought it
necessary to express respect for Mr. Glad
stone, upon which the speech was an at
tack.
Gladstone or Rotebery.
LONDON, Eng, Oct. 9.â The Midland
Liberal Federation has called a meeting
for the purpose of offering the leadership
of the Liberal party to Gladstone, and in
the event of the refusal of the ex- Premier
to assume the leadership, to reaffirm their
confidence in the leadership of Lord
Rosebery. _________^_^_
REVIEWS THE FRENCH TROOPS.
Russia's Czar and Czarina Witness a
Great Demonstration at Chalons
Arranged in Their Honor.
PARIS, France, Oct. 9.â The weather
at Chalons was rainy and altogether dis
agreeable at daybreak, threatening to mar
the effect, if not absolutely prevent, the
review of the troops in honor of the Czar,
but at 10 o'clock the skies had cleared and
the day was as fine as could be desired.
It is reported here that the Czar and
Czarina will revisit Paris in the spring and
remain three weeks. The grand review of
the troops at Chalons began at noon. His
Majesty appeared on horseback, fronting
the truops. President Faure and the
Czarina sat together in a landau.
The trains arrived at Chalons through
out the afternoon as rapidly and fre
quently as they could be bandied and
were packed to suffocation within and
crowds hung upon the footboards outside
the cars. It is estimated that 150,000 spec
tators witnessed the review.
The review was a grand success. The
Czar, who wore the red Cossack uniform,
appeared to be in excellent spirits and
displayed much enthusiasm over the
maneuvers. The defile was finished at
2:30 p M-, and was a superb spectacle,
which elicited prolonged cheering from the
multitude. The Czar divided with the
troops the acclaims of the crowds and
eaily received the larger share. After
the revi v a luncheon was served for the
guests i nd the officers of the staff, at
whirl) 500 covers were laid.
At the luncheon the Czar gave a toast
to the French army, declaring the unal
terable friendship of the armies of Rus
sia and France. After breakfasting the
Czar and Czarina started for Darmstadt.

HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 9.â Bernal. whose

During the excitement of the election in
the city strange Cubans arrived and scat

and suspicious looking boxes preceded
them the night before. It is believed here
that the transfer of fuel, arms and men
will be made at Biscay ne.

Hi* future Home in Michigan.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 9.â A little boy
] 6 years of age b*gan a long journey from
! this city to Bay City, Mich., to-day. He
is Harold Bradley, son of F. W. Bradley,
from whom a divorce was obtained by
Kate Bradley in July.
Mrs. Bradley came to San Diego to pro
cure the divorce, to which her husband
consented, as they were cousins and were
mutually desirous of dissolving the bonds
that galled. As noon as the decree was
obtained Mrs. Bradley married James
Benton, a New York City lawyer, and left
her little boy here in the care of her land
lady.
The father did not want the child and
the mother sent word that in her new life
in New York City she did not want to be
bothered with him either. So Harold was
an outcaat. though his mother paid his
bills until his grandfather, F. B. Bradley
of Ba3' City, sent for him.
The boy is heir to the estates of his
father and grandfather and will in time
become possessor of $1,000,000. yet he was
very sad to-day when compelled to part
from the kind-hearted old lady who had
been keeping: nim. He cried bitterly and
said he didu't want to see any of his rela
tives any more. He will make the long
trip to fiay City entirely alone.

SAN JOSE. Cal., Oct. 9.â Hon. F. X.
Schoonmaker, Congressman for New
Jersey, addressed tv.o large audiences In
this city to-day. On the grounds of the
Hotel Vendome this afternoon he deliv
ered a forcible address illustrating the fal
lacy of the free-coinage of silver doctrine;
and this evening, at the pavilion, he de>
livered au exhaustive argument in favor
of a protective tariff.
In regard to the silver question, he said
the Democratic party in annuling the reci
procity laW of Blame had destroyed the
only hope by which this country could
force foreign nations into an international
acreement for the free coinage of silver.
The election of McKinley, he said, would
restore this law and enable the United
States to say to foreign countries that if
they failed to sign an international agree
ment tbis country would fail to have com
mercial relations with them.

under the law it is far better
to have it fully settled by the
courts in order that no voter be misled in
casting his ballot, and I believe that I will
be upheld in this statement by all those
members of the Democratic State
Central Committee who have met
with me on the question. I have
waited as requested by the latter
until the last moment required by law,
according to the opinion rendered by the
Attorney-General, oefore mailing my cer
tificates to the various County Clerks.
I would also state that I have never
been requested by the leaders of
either the Democratic or the Populist
parties to group their Presidential electors
under a combined party heading, nor were
my intentions in the matter inquired into
by Chairman Alford until several days
after the certificates had been filed in my
office."

WILL INFARE STOCKTON.
Republican Clubs of Sacramento to At'
tend To-Aiffht's Rally.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 9. â The
streets of this city were thronged to-night
by the various Republican clubs busy at
their finishing drill before raiding Stock
ton to-morrow night. The . echoing foot
steps of thousands drew half of the in
habitants of the city out of doors to criti
cize and admire those of their acquaint
ances who were in line. . . â  . . .. â .
At the various club headquarters ' the
secretaries were kept busily employed
during - the entire evening enrolling new
names on the club rolls, applicants stand
ing patiently in line until they could
reach â¢ the enrolling-desk. At the bead
quarters of the Assembly District /clubs
over seventy names were added within a
half-hour, and ail of the newcomers de
manded suits, that they might take part

Stradley of San Francisco addressed a
silver meeting here last night. He said:
"Why are the mills closed? Is it not be
cause there is a lack of demand for their
products? This lack of demand is caused
by the fact that for years past producers
in the South and West have been raising
croDs at an absolute loss. If we want to
open factories we should commence at the
bottom and make more money and thus
stimulate the demand. We will open the
factories by first opening the mints."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1869.
TACOMA LAWYER'S
SUDDEN FLIGHT
Colonel W. W. Likens Is
Missing From the
City.
Left a Eill of Sale for His
Office Furniture to a
Friend.
HIS WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN.
Had Bjen Threatened With Criminal
Prosecution by an Insurance
Company.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 9.â Colonel W.
W. Likens, a prominent lawyer of this
city, who came to Tacoma eight years
ago, mysteriously disappeared last Tues
day, leaving a note in his office stating
that he had gone to Seattle. He also left
a bill of sale of the office furniture to a
friend who had gone on his bond to the
State Insurance Company of Oregon.
Likens recently received several thousand
dollars from the insurance company to
satisfy a judgment recently entered
against it in this county, and the com
pany and other creditors have been de
manding a settlement, while Likens has
been sparring for time to avoid a threat
ened criminal prosecution.
Between 1871 and 1875 Likens was a
prominent lawyer in Mineral Point, Wis.,
being associated with ex-Congressman
Amasa Cobb, afterward Justice of the
Supreme Court of Nebraska. Likens in
1874 got into trouble with some of his
clients at Mineral Point, who were mem
bers of the Masonic fraternity, and the re
salt was that he, a thirty-second degree
Mason, was expelled from the order.
Likens then drifted to Colorado, where
he served four years in the penitentiary at
Canyon City for forgery. By those who
knew of the circumstances, it is said he
was a "fighting prohibitionist" and was
"railroaded" into the penitentiary by
saloon men. He refused to ask for a new
trial or a pardon, but the warden of the
penitentiary declined to lock him up.
Likens was taken into the penitentiary
as a boarder, where he continued to prac
tice Jaw until his time was served.
Judge Stallcup of the Superior Court in
Tacotna knew Likens well in Colorado,
and says of his prison experience: "That
scrape was aa unfortunate affair. Likens
was strong willed and would not allow
anything to be done for him. The Su
preme Court refused to debar him and his
name stands on the roll to-day."
Likens was a law partner of Judge
Amasa Cobb in Mineral Point When he
first came to Tacoma he made from
$10,000 to $40,000 a year, all of which went
into disastrous real estate speculations.
When he It- ft Denver his wife was matron
of the State Reform School for Girls. At
the time of tne accession of Governor
Waite Mrs. Likens' head fell into the
basket, along with three other Republican
office- holders. IX is said Mrs. Likens has
recently secured a divorce.
Likens was a member of the Grand
Army, though not prominent in the or
ganization. He enlisted as a private in
the Seventh Wisconsin Volunteers, and
before he was 18 years of age was captain
of a company. He was soon promoted
and for the greater part of the service was
colonel of a Wisconsin regiment and
fought in many of the battles of the cam
paigns in Tennessee and Mississippi, lie
was always prominent', in political gather
ings in this county and State and this
year was an adviser of the silver Republi
cans in the movement toward State tusion
and was disappointed in not receiving a
nomination ior State office at the fusion
convention.

SAN RAFAEL'S BOULEVARD.
Governor Budd and Party Inspect the Re-
cently Constructed Highway to
Tiburon.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Oct. 9.â Governor
Budd, accompanied by a party of gentle
men to-day, in an inspection of the drive
way known as the San Rafael andTiburon
boulevard. Prison Director Wilkins, who
has done a great deal to promote the en
terprise, was major domo of the party,
which included, beside the Governor,
Prison Directors Hayes and Fitzgerald,
Warden Haley, A. W. Foster, Captain
Ellis, Supervisors Burbank, Scown and
Gardner, Editors Pryor and Barstow,
District Attorney Martinelli, Auditor Ben
son, ex-Sheriff Tunstead and others.
The work has been done by prison
labor, the Legislature having passed a law
to authorize it, under special conditions,
and without which it would have been
impossible to secure this splendid high
way for many years. Several gangs of
these laborers were passed on the way, en
gaged in constructing two or three links,
or places not completed wnen the main
work was done. The finished part of the
road extends from Green brae station
northward nearly to a point opposite
Schuetzen Park, where the city has taken
up the work, and will continue It to Irwin
street, at the head of which is the en
trance to the Hotel Rafael.
Governor Budd and the directors were
highly pleased with the work done. The
grade over the hills is very lightâ about 6
per cent. The road is cut along the side
of the bills and macadamized, and makes
a magnificent drive, commanding pano
ramas of splendid scenery cf the bay and
opposite coast. When completed to
Tiburon, fourteen miles, it will afford one
of the most inviting drives and bicycle
courses in the State.

ments from Shareholder*.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Oct. 9.â The Su
preme Court has affirmed the decision of
the lower court in the case of the Ven
tura and Ojai Valley Railway Company,
respondent, vs. J. S. Collins, a banker of
Ventura, appellant
The defendant bought twenty shares of
stock of the company at the price of
$2000. He paid several assessments, ag
gregating $600, but refused to pay one
called June 6. 1895, of which his propor
tion was $800, and the company brought
suit to enforce payment.

porate powers to collect assessments on

present case, the shareholders are respon
sible individuals.
NEE DS O FSTOCKTON ASELUM.
Director* Want lan Appropriation of
9401,000 for Two tears.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 9.â The directors
of the State asylum here to-day re-elected
Superintendent Asa Clark to ] serve for, the
ensuing four years. The chief , business
transacted , was the framing of ' the ' bi
ennial report to Governor Budd.
This caused considerable discussion, as
the original draft of the report asked for a
general appropriation of $440,000 for the
maintenance : during i the â¢ next two fiscal
years of 1700 patients. :
: This was vigorously opposed by Di
rector J. D. McDougald of Stockton, who
claimed that the instituation could be run
for much less money, as shown by the ex
penditures of the past year, which are
nearly $10,000 below the appropriation.
He argued that even 1700 patients could
be supported for very little more money
in view of the many improvements made
within the past year for caring for patients.
Directors McDonald and Steffans came to
his way of thinking, and the request J was
cut down to $401,000. The report showed
the asylum to be one of the best managed
of the State institutions. v. ;

vousness and occasional palpitation of the
heart all came from one cause and : that
was coffee drinking. The good man went
on farther to say : "My child, it you were
as strong as your husband and had- the
miles of outdoor walking to do that he has
daily you could drink one cup of coffee, or
perhaps two, at breakfast and dinner with-
out any very bad effects, but the same
poisonous alkaloids exist in coffee as are
found in tobacco, whisky, strychnine and
morphine. There is not so great a pro-
portion of them in coffee as in the other
drugs, but a sufficient amount exists to
seriously injure any one whose constitu-
tion is a little below par. All of these
drues can be U3ed for a time by perfectly
healthy people, but if their use is per-
sisted â in long enough the human body
finally gives evidence of the effect of the
steady poison, and many people who do
not know tbis fact die because of their un-
natural habits. â ' If you could use a hot
drink in the morning made from the
nourishing grains that nature has pro-,
.video for the use of man it would satisfy
your appetite and fatten your body."
A wholesome, delicious hot drink of the
kind that old doctor referred to is found
in Po3tum Coffee, made from grains by
the Postum Cereal Company (limited) of
Battle Creek, Mich.; it brews the rich
color of Java or Mocha, has a grand fra-
grance and the pungeut taste demanded
by all coffee drinkers. No poisonous al-
kaloids are found here, and man is only
safe when be sticks to nature's food, fur-
nished by the Creator, prepared in a num-
ber of different ways, to be sure. : Ruddy
health and red blood will follow the dis-
continuance of unnatural drinks and the
substitution therefor of the Cereal food
drink. Its use will tell the facts more
plainly in the body than words can be
made to express. Grocers furnish it and
experience teaches that it goes aDout three
times as far as coffee.

Three Attempts to Destroy
the Four-Masted Bark
Drumcraig.
Incipient Blazes Discovered in
Time to Preserve the
Vessel.
MUTINOUS SAILOB SUSPECTED.
Had Threatened When Placed in
Irons That He Would Be
Revenged.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Oct. 9.â
There is considerable suppressed excite
ment around the water front in Tacoma
over the attempt to burn a fine English
bark lying at one of the wharves dis
charging a general cargo. The matter is
being carefully suppressed there, while
two detectives are trying to trap the fire
bugs. Thrice the vessel has been set, afire
and each time narrowly escaped.
The fine four-masted bark Drumcraig is
moored alongside of the Eureka doct. It
is discharging a cargo taken aboard in
England, and a portion of wHich was
landed in Vancouver. On the passage out
from Europe one of the sailors became
mutinous and so violent that it was neces
sary to put him in irons. Some of his
shipmates say that while he was in irons
he threatened that when .liberated and
ashore be wouid wreak his vengeance on
the ship.
A few nights after he left the Drnmcraig
in Vancouver It was discovered that an at
tempt had been made to burn the vessel.
The sailor had disappeared and, though
suspicion pointed toward him, the watch
was doubled to prevent a second attempt.
A week later the vessel went to Tacoma
and a day or two afterward one of the
crew reported having seen the suspected
man skulking along the back part of the
wharf.
That night a second attempt was made
to fire the vesrel. In a place where a lot
of combustible paint had been stored, the
paint having been removed only a few
hours before, a good-sized blaze was dis
covered. Before getting mucn headway it
was quenched.
The most diligent watch was then be
gun to catch the firebug. On Monday
night another attempt was made to set
the bark afire.
The blaze did not get much headway
and died out. Tne police were notified,
and two detectives are now at wort night
and day trying \o unravel the mystery
and arrest the suspected sailor. The cap
tain and officers are dumfounded, and
aside from suspecting the sailor, whom
they ironca on the voyage out from Eng
land for insubordination, are at a loss to
account for the several attempts to burn
the bark. The ship's officers say that
every man aboard is above suspicion, and
that" several trifling events indicate tnat
some one boarded the barJr to apply the
match. Each time the vessel was set afire
there was a different watch on deck.
TO BEGAN THE UMATILLA.
Attempt to Move the Me am hip Will Be
Made To-Oay.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Oct. 9.â lt
is confidently expected by the stranded
and half-sunken steamship Umatilla's
officers that at noon to-morrow the vessel
will be pumped out, floated around Point
Wilson into Port Townsend Bay and
beached where it will be safe from bad
weather. Then if it is deemed safe it will
be taken to the drydock at Quartermaster
Harbor for permanent repairs.
The ship's two pumps and four other
12-inch pumps were started to-day and in
five minutes lowered the water four incnes.
All of the holes found in the Umatilla's
bottom have been stopped, and it is be
lieved that it can be easily pumped out
and be afloat by noon.
As much freight as possible has been
removed from the vessel, two scowJoads
being landed to-day. In every other way
it has been lightened and is now in good
condition to be raised. If to-morrow's
attempt is unsuccessful four additional
]8-inch pumps will be used in a second
effort to raise the half-submersred steamer.
STOCKTON'S SENSATION.
Kasson Estate Sued on a Note
Given to a Saloon-
Keeper.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 9.â An action
commenced in tde Superior Court to-day
may result in an interesting fight involv
ing the Kr.sson estate when the trial takes
place. The plaintiffs are A. F. Naher and
k B. F. Kohl berg, who, by their attorneys.
\-Nicol & Orr, sue Clark McChesney, as
executor of the will of George M. Kasson,
to recover $6245 42, alleged to be due on a
debt of $5000, contracted by Kasson some
time before his death. The sum sued for
includes the interest claimed to be due on
the original amount. The note on which
tne action is commenced was given to
George- Af. Mowry, a saloon-keeper, and
by him transferred to the plaintiffs.
For some time it has been whispered
that sensational developments would
come to light in the Kasson estate, and
that not only a note for a large sum of
money but a contract marriage would fig
nre in the case. McChesney, it is alleged,
will endeavor co prove that the note was
given to Mowry by Kasson while he was
drunk and ignorant of what he was
about.
According to the story now being told
Kasson, while under the influence of
liquor, sought the companion shiD. of a
characterless woman, and while in his
cups be offered to marry her, and actual
ly did sign a contract of marriage that
somebody made out.
It was on the same occasion, according
to report, that the note was given by the
rich rancher to the saloonist. The note
was given in return for various notes of
much smaller denomination. McChesney
will endeavor to prove that Kasson was as
drunk and irresponsible when he signed
these smaller notes as he was when he
sicned the big one.

a nonsuit made by the proponents in the
Parker will contest Mr. Delmas then
moved that the allegations of fraud and
undue influence be stricken from the com

THE BIG CRICKET MATCH
All CaHfornia Enthused Over
Next Week's Great
Event.
The Australian Team to Be Met by
Many Prominent Citizens Nxt
Tuesday.
All cricuetdom is discussing but one sub
ject â the forthcoming match on Wednes
day and Thursday next between the
world-famous Australian team and eight
een representative California cricketers.
It will undoubtedly be the most import
ant cricket event ever seen on this coast,
ana should the weather be favorable the
grand stand of the Presidio athletic
grounds is likely to be packed.
A committee composted of the executive
committee of the St. George's Club and of
ficers and delegates of the cricket associa
tion met on Thursday evening and ap
pointed the following reception commit
tee to meet the visitois on their arrival in
Oakland next Tnesday evening: W. Greer
Harrison, honorable president of St.
George's Club and president of the Pacific
Cricket Club; British Consul-General J.
W. Warburton, president of the Califor
nia Cricket Association; Edward Brown,
president of the Alameda Cricket Club;
Dr. Caivert, president of the California
Cricket Club; Hon. Stewart Menzies;
Frank McCoppin, ex-United States Com
missioner to the Melbourne Exposition;
Thomas J. Flynn, proprietor of the Wasp ;
James Markland, Rev. vV. W. Bolton and
Rev. James Fell. They will leave this
City by the 7 P. M. boat on Tuesday.
R. H. Delefield was appointed a com
mittee to secure tents, etc. W. Greer Har
rison accepted the treasurership.
It was decided that only members of the
committee and one or two others, to be
appointed by the treasurer, should be em
powered to solicit and receive subscrip
tions toward defraying the expenses of
the game.
Under the management of the secretary
the grounds are being put in perfect order.
A concrete pitch has been laid and rollers
and waierer.s are hard at work.
Notification has been received from the
following cricketers in the interior offer
ing their services on the California team :
W. R. West of Stockton; C. Simmonds
of Lcomis; A. H. Jackson of Auburn;
Captain Keeling of Lakeport; W. Spencsr
Mayo of San Jose; H. Duckworth Bowley
of Lawrences, ,Santa Clara County; K.
Hamilton Sims, secretary Hanford Club,
all of whom v.ill bring down good delega
tions to witness the match.
Captain W. R. Robertson of the Bohe
mians, who will captain the local players,
was seen by a Call representative yester
day in reference to the tactics he would
pursue in the contest. He said:
"If I win the toss I will put the visitors
iv, in order to give the spectators a mag
nificent batting exhibition, such as has
never before been seen on this coast. At
the start. I will take the bowling at one
end, with H. H. Cookson as my partner.
Myers of the Pacifies will do duty with
the gloves. The, changes of bowling,
which will, no doubt, be soon called for,
will bring on Ward Jr., Sloman, Dickin
son, Peel and other noted trundlers.
With this material and the balance of our
eishteen strong team in the field we may
be able to dispose of them for a reason
able score.
"When their inning comes to a close â
if it ever does â I hope with the assistance
of such batsmen as Richardson, Butt,
Moriarity, West, Jackson, Keeling, Bow
ley. Sloman, Hogue, Bowhill and myself
(this last being added with the modesty of
merit) to come somewhere near if not up
to the kangaroo score.
"What we have most to fear is the stage
fright of our team. If they will only keep
up their pluck and forget that they are
playing against such men as Griffin, Trott,
Trumble and Johns, and with the eyes of
the world and of their lady friends upon
them, I have no doubt that we shall make
a creditable showing and prove to the
United States that cricket in California is
only second to cricket in Philadelphia â if
that."
Letters, telegrams and telephone mes
sages regarding the great mutch are pour
ing in from all parts of the State. Never
before has tne game received such an im
petus here, and even those who have
never yet seen the game are likely to at
tend the match out of curiosity.
BUCKLEYITES BUCKLE IN.
They Will Go on the Ballot a* "Silver
Democrats" and Populists.
The decision ot the Supreme Court de
nying the Buckieyitcs the right to use
the designation "Democrat" on the bal
lot had the effect of rather enlivening the
camp of that faction last evening.
Most of the Buckley ticket will go on
the ballot under the designation "Popu
list" anyway, so that the decision merely
forces the presentation by petition of the
small portion of the ticket not taken up
by the local Populists.
The Buckleyites, however, will present
their entire ticket by petition, and their
proposition last night was to go on the
ballot under the title "Silver Democrats,"
the decision of the Supreme Court of the
day before regarding the Palmer and
Buckner electors being taken to give them
tins privilege.

UNION VETERANS.
They Will Not Indorse Any Can-
dldates for Municipal Offices.
A joint meeting of all the committees of
the Union Veterans' League was held at
their headquarters at the Auditorium
yesterday at 2 p. m. In the absence of
President Ruddick, the meeting was called
to order by Vice-President General John
F. Sheeban. The object of the meeting
bad been under discussion for some time,
and at yesterday's meeting a final plan of
action was adopted.
One of the subjects discussed by the
committee was the fact that all the Elec
tion Commissioners but one were Demo
crats, and that the precinct officers were
nearly all Democrats, and about all the
offices â Federal, State and municipal â
were filled by Democrats, and conse
quently that it behooveÃ the Republican
party to guard well its interest until elec
tion day. Therefore the committee de
cided that it would not only be necessary
to vote the Republican National ticket,
but also to see that the vote would be
counted on election day.
It was decided to appoint a committee
in every precinct so that they might can
vass their respective precincts by the day
of election, and in order to more thor
oughly perfect the system it would be
necessary that the veterans forward their
addresses and the number of their pre
cincts and Assembly districts to head
quarters as soon as possible in care of the
secretary of the Union Veterans' Patriotic
League.
It was also decided that the committee
should meet daily, Bunday excepted, at 3
p. m., until the day of election. The com
mittee is now as follows: William J.
Ruddick, president; General John F.
Sheehan, first vice-president; Charles M.
Leavy, second vice-president; D. M.
Cashin, secretary ; Martin Murray, treas
urer; executive committee â General
James Coey, John J. Shepbeard, Jerome
Deasy, C. A. Fuller, Thomas Mallon, J. T.
Bonnitield, C. B. Grass, C. D. Douglas,
John Heffernan.
The following preamble and resolution
were unanimously adopted:
Whekeas, The Union Veterans' Patriotic
League is a strictly National organization
whose aim and objects are the election of the
National Republican candidates for President
and Vice- President of the United States, it is,
thereiore,
Resolved, That the San Francisco Encamp
ment of the Union Veterans' Patriotic League
will not indorse any candidate for municipal
office, that we will not solicit or accept a con
tribution from any candidate for office, nor
will we authorize toe name of this organiza
tion to be used for any such purpose.
D. M. Cashin, Secretary.
A GRAND RALLY.
Republican Voters of the Thlrty-
Fifth District Out In Force.
A grand rally of the voters of the Thirty
fifth Assembly District took place last
evening at the headquarters of the regu
lar Republican Club at 3008 Mission street
The meeting was called to order by Presi
dent William Gill, and after a stirrinz
melody from the band Secretary J. J.
Guilfoyle read a resolution pledging the
club to support the National Republican
party. This was unanimously adopted.
A resolution was adopted indorsing the
action of the Board of Education in pro
viding a high school for the Mission.
The meeting was addressed by W. A.
Deane, candidate for Auditor; A. B.
Treadwell, nominee for Police Judge;
William H. Powers, candidate for School
Director; James Kidney and Louis Titus.
These laid down the principles of the Re
publican party clearly and forcibly. Bry
anism, Populism and anarchism was
shown np in all its vacuity. First it was
free trade, then free silver and then free
everything else that was impracticable.
A. B. Treadwell, who made his third
speech of the evening, gave his audience
his ideas of the duties of a Police Judge
and tne maximum of time he should be
absent from his courtroom between the
hours of 9 a. m. and 5 p. m. on working
days.
James Kidney in his remarks paid some
attention to the great aggregation of capi
tal behind the Democratic candidate for the
Presidency, also the Democratic nominee
for the Vic -Presidency, the millionaire
owner of banks and ships, and who ran
his business in gold. Over $682,000,000, he
â¢aid, was represented by the power that
picked the nominees at the Democratic
National Convention. The Thirty-fifth
Republican Assembly District, the speaker
said, would roll up an overwhelming ma
jority for WcKiney and the Republican
party.

the Forty-first District, was present and
addressed the club at length on the issues
of the campaign. His speech aroused
much enthusiasm and was frequently ap
plauded.
Other speakers followed tne Judge and
were well received. Letters were read
from different comrades commending the
action of the club in passing resolutions
condemning ''Coin" Harvey for his un
manly and unpatriotic utterances against
General Sickles and others as "a carload of
old bummers," etc., and expressing grati

club and recommending that each woman
pledge hersell to gain one vote from the
outside for McKinley.
Edgar Peixotto made an address. Mrs.
Nellie Holbrook Blinn made a strong plea
for woman suffrage. Mrs. H. Lewis fa
vored the club with the "Bear Song," ac

POLITICS IN ALAMEDA.
Republicans Hold a Blar Rally at
Which W. B. Heyburn Speaks.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 9.â The largest
crowd that ever gathered on Park street
thronged that thoroughfare to-night. The
occasion was a Republican rally, and Lin
derman's Opera-house was filled to over
flowing long before the speaker arrived.
The McKinley Drill Corps, in their natty
white uniforms, paraded on Park street,
headed by a band, and were followed by a
carriage in which were Judge Greene, W.
B. Heyburn and E. K. Taylor. On reach
ing the hall, Mr. Taylor introduced F. H.
McCormick as chairman of the evening.
Judge Greene and Sam P. Hall, candidates
for the Superior bench, were introduced,
but neither spoke more than a few sen
tences.
Mr. Heyburn was greeted with tremen
dous cheers as he arose to speak. He said
in part: "Politics is business. Those
things that are not permissible in business
are not permissible in politics. When we
undertake a business affair we look
around to determine what course to
pursue. If there ever was a campaign
where these rules should apply it is this
one. Our opponents are continually try
ing to find some excuse for turning the
Republican party out of power. Four
years ago when they could find no other
excuse they told them they had some
thing free to offer, and we got free trade as
the panacea for all the ills we suffered.
What wa3 the result? Nothing but dis
aster. I believe there is no man who
would declare for free trade. But what
did they do? They simply tampered with
the revenue and business of the country.
"They aie pleased to tell us that the
present condition of the country arises
from the crime of 1873.
"Where this disaster is said to have
fallen the heaviest there was not a dollar
in silver in circulation. How could legis
lation nffecting the silver dollar of that
time affect the interests of thp people
when none of it was in circulation ?
"There is but one party that is in favor
of bimetallism in the United States, and
that is the Republican party. These par
ties that are so hard to name only pro
pose to substitute silver monometallism.
The silver dollar of to-day has the promise
of the Government to pay, and is as good
and as fully valuable as the gold dollar."
GAINED A VICTORY.
MÂ«Jor John A. Darling Has Secured a
Transfer and Will Remain at the
Presidio.
Major John A. Darling, Fifth Artillery, U. S.
A., has arranged with Major Ramsay for ft
transfer to the Third Artillery, and will there
fore remain at the Presidio until further or
ders. His friends in the army say that he
may, after the departure of General Graham
Â«nd the Fifth Artillery next week, become
post commander-in-chief at the Presidio, nnd
hold that important position until the arrival
of Colonel Bainbridge, Third Artillery. The
major commanded the post at Black Point,
under Generals McDowell, Schofield, Pope and
Howard. In 1867 he commanded Goat Island,
and foiled the railroad company, which was
then preparing to seize it.
At the Presidio the hope is expressed that
the relations between the coming commander,
Colonel Bainbridge, will be more cordial than
those which have long existed between Gen
eral Graham and th? major. It is quite grati
fying for the major's friends to contemplate
that he will no longer be compelled to bow to
the superior authority of General Graham, and
they perceive in this transfer a victory gained
for the major. The Secretary of War, hi his
wiÂ«;<lom, may keep these officers wide apart.
With one in San Francisco and the other In
New York there cannot be- much friction.
Among the many duties devolving upon Mr.
Lament none is more difficult to perform than
that of preserving peace IB theariny. By this
time he must compreheud that the reservation
at the Presidio is not large enough for General
Graham and Major Darling.
Colonel Bainbridge, the coming com
mander, is said by his army associates to be a
master of all the arts of diplomacy and a
superior strategist in the affairs of post ad
ministrations. His prestige in society equals
his rank in the army, and all acquiesce
readily in his leadership.
The report that Major Darling is to be re
tired on Hccount of pnysiccl disability is re
garded by his friends as incredible. Phy
sically the major is in superb condition and is
likely to astonish a board of artny surgeons by
his robustness.
SULLIVAN MAKES
SERIOUS CHARGES
He Says the Quill Jury Has
Been Under Evil
Influences.
Two Jurors and Two Railroad
Detectives Seen in
Company.
THE JURY WAS DISMISSED.
The Members Said There Was No
Chance of Reaching an
Agreement.
A sensation was sprung in Judge Dain
gerfield's department of the Superior
Court last evening, when the case of
Anthony Quill against the Southern
Pacific Company went to the jury after a
protracted trial covering nine days.
Mr. Quill sued the corporation for $50,
--000 for the death of his daughter, May
Quill, an accomplished young girl, who
was killed by the Berkeley local at Dwight
station in February last.
Before the jury was charged by Judge
Daingerfield Attorney Matt Sullivan, who
represented the plaintiff, electrified the
court and spectators by announcing that
he had absolute proof that at least two of
the jurors had been seen in the company
of railroad detectives and were open to
the suspicion of having come under rail
road influence.
He pointed a warning finger at John F.
Sweeny and John Heany, and told them
that they had been watched by detectives,
and would be until the case had finally
been disposed of. He said he knew posi
tively that they had expressed a certain
belief that the plaintiff could not get a
verdict so long as they were on the jury,
and that a certain P. Isaacs, who was then
in the courtroom, was responsible for their
conviction in favor of the defendant. He
claimed that the latter had exerted in
fluence which would come under the crim
inal statutes covering such cases.
Attorney Sullivan's startling declara
tion was made about 8 o'clock after the
jury had been charged. The arguments
were finished at 5 o'clock and the jury was
taken out for supper. At the hour named
they were called in and after the foreman
had announced that they had failed to
, agree Attorney Sullivan made his accusa
tion.
Juryman Sweeny announced that he
knew Mr. Isaacs from a jury in a previous
case, but denied that He had been influ
enced in his opinion of the case.
Judge Daingerfield said that he T7ould
send the jury out until 11 o'clock and
would then return and hear what the
members had to say regarding the case.
About the hour promised, Judge Dainger
field came into court, and at once the op

FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM HcKINLET, of Ohio
FOR VICK-PKESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Come down, Mr. Laumeister.
Regular Republicanism holas the fort. â 
Now is the time for loyal Republicans
to rally to the standard.
Where Democracy is in power it hits
Populism with a club, and where it is
weak, it tries the bunko game.
The Democratic vote has fallen off even
in Georgia. Nothing seems to be sticking
to Bryan except Tom Watson.
Unwise politics brought distress upon
the country, but wise politics will re
deem it by the election of McKinley.
The history of the country shows that a
Republican victory is always followed by
good business, and that is what we shall
have this year.
If Bryan should be elected and under
take to make his cabinet from among the
men wuo have taken the stump for him it
would be a menagerie.
Democrats who are trying to get worfc
ingmen to vote for them ought to explain
what their party did for American labor
when it was trusted Oefore.
Secretary Morton is despondent over the
outlook, and certainly not without cause,
for his dearly loved free-trade Democracy
has been smashed to smithereens.
You may call Robert Ingersoll a silver
tongued orator, bnt don't forget to note
that his words are golden, and that the
money he advocates, like his argument, is
bo and.
The gold Democrats have fortunately
secured a place for their ticket on the offi
cial ballot, and now conservative Democ
racy will have a chance to show how much
it amounts to.
If the new charter should be adopted
the Mayor wouid be almost an autocrat,
and San Francisco cannot afford to take
chances with a Buckiey or a Rainey can
didate with such prospects.
The Georgia Democrats treated the
Populists of their State in the same way
that Bryan has treated Watson, and if the
Populists of California are wise they will
derive a profit from the double lesson.
While we were not told what kind of
meat was served at the Democratic barbe
cue at Santa Rosa the presumption is that
it was mutton. Democracy is never so
enthusiastic as when downing a sheep.
By omitting to file a list of their nomi
nations in time the Stanislaus Democrats
have a providential chance to keep off the
official ballot and avoid the tidal wave. It
is sometimes of advantage to be asleep.
The attempt of W. F. Tay!or to answer
Congressman Butterworth at San Diego
must have been well worth hearing. A
monkey is no match for a lion, but when
ever he attacks one he is pretty sure to be
amusing.
According to the decision of the Su
preme Court the 'icket headed by Colon.el
Taylor is the reeular Republican ticket in
this City, and there should be no more
dispute among Republicans about sup
porting it.
Chairman Danforth of the Democratic
State Committee in New York is reported
to have taid Senator Hill will support
Bryan, but will not make a public state
ment nor take the stump. What kind of
support is that?
In his address on Thursday evening Mr.
Phelan excused himself for speaking by
Josh Billings' argument, "Blow your own
horn or the same it will not be blown,"
thus doing a real injustice to the blowing
abilities of his friend Rainty.
The attacks made by the Bryanite press
on Generals Sickles, Alger and Howard
have proven to be roorbacks of the worst
kind, and the fusion managers are wishing
now tnat they could shut up some of the
blatherskites that are talking and writing
for them.
What grinds the Populists is the grow
ing consciousness that In fusing with
Democracy they have allied themselves
with the worst elements of that party.
They honed to combine with decent Demo
crats, and behold they find themselves in
the camp of Buckley.
(Bereft of its brainy men and its finan
cial supporters, the Democratic party of
California is compelled to rely on a news
paper for a subscription to carry on the
campaign. Hitherto the newspapers went
to the campaign committee for funds.
This "reversal of form" is something new
in California politics.
REGULARITY SUSTAINED.
The Supreme Court has sustained the
claim of the ticket headed by Colonel
Charlts L. Taylor to be the rightful and
regular Republican ticket in this City.
Thus by tne court of last appeal has Re
publican regularity been maintained. The
controversy over that issue is at an end.
If any who call themselves Republicans
continue in opposition to the ticket headed
by Colonel Taylor they can do so only as
avowed bolters and foes of the party or
ganization.
The history of the controversy is fa
miliar to the public. The convention by
which Colonel Taylor and his colleagues
on the ticket were nominated was called
by the Republican County Committee,
and every action taken by it from its
organization to its close was iv strict
accordance with party law and precedent.
The title of the nominees of the conven
tion to a place on the official ballot as the
Republican candidates was disputed, but
was decided by Registrar Hinton in their
favor. An appeal was taken to the Re
publican State Central Committee, and
that impartial body of Republican leaders
representing all parts of the State sus
tained the ticket with but a single dis
seuting voice. The Supreme Court was
the only other authority to which the
controversy could be carried, ana that
eminent tribunal has now spoken sustain
ing tae decree of the Registrar andj con
firming that of the State Central Commit
tee.
The Call can justly congratulate all
loyal Republicans on this termination of
a prolonged and disturbing controver-y in
the party. From the first, The Call
upheld the cause of the regular ticket on
the broad ground that regularity is essen
tial to party discipline, organization and
success. It has been clear all along, more
over, to intelligent Republicans that vic
tory could be attained only by harmony
in the ranks and the cordial co-operation
of all members of the party working
together within the organization and in
support of the nominees named by the
regular convention, which represented the
historic continuity of the party in, San
Francisco.
The decision of the Supreme Court puts
an end to all doubts and questions con
cerning the right of tlie regular ticket to
stand as the representative of San Fran
cisco Republicanism. The one plain duty
of all Republicans is now to support that
ticket. Loyal hearts caa win a sweeping
victory. Democra-y is divided and de
moralized. A united Republican party
has before it an opportunity for an unpre
cedented success. Let us turn from
party dissensions and go forward. Let us
elect Colonel Taylor, give San Francisco a
good government, and assure the electoral
vote of California to McKinley and Hobart.
Onr opponents say to one audience
that our dollars are too dear, and to
another audience they say the new free
coinage of silver dollars will be just as
good as the present silver dollar. Now,
if thia I* so, it will be just as dear as the
present dollar. We want good money in
this country, and we want good morals
in this country, and we want public and
private honesty in this country, and we
do not propose to be a Nation of repudl

DEMORALIZED DEMOCRACY.
The demoralized condition of the Demo
cratic party of California is a tit subject
for the thoughtful consideration of all
citizens, no matter to what political or
ganization they may adhere.
Tuat the Democratic party is rent in
twain is due to the fact that an overmas
tering hunger for uosiible success led a
boisterous and numerically powerful fac
tion of the party to indorse theories and
isms foreign not only to the true princi
ples of Democracy, but antagonistic to the
fundamental truths of American states
manship.
The shifty temporizers of the Demo
cratic party, those who were willing to
sacrifice principle and the honest convic
tions of a lifetime for the glittering bau
ble of a popular campaign motto, stood
stolidly by and watched the eld Demo
cratic party go to ruin by indorsing all the
cranky ideas of the Populistic party, with
a few anarchistic and revolutionary senti
ments added by way of variety.
When the overanxious and not too scru
pulous advocates of "success at any price"
allowed their party to venture in these
dangerous regions they were blinded to
the ruin which threatened, and which
men of finer sensibilities would have rec
ognized Deforehand.
The furious demagogues, who, with in
sult and contumely, drove from the Chi
caeo convention all men who would not
agree with them and Mr. Bryan on the
financial question, could not foresee
that they were inviting defeat instead of
securing victory. Yet so it is.
They find themselves without sufficient
funds to pay the legitimate expenses of
the campaign because their former finan
ciers and supporters are now arrayed
against them.
The state of the Bryanized Democratic
party in California illustrates the condi
tion of that party throughout the country.
Bereft of the brainy, resourceful men of
their party the shouting demagogues are
everywhere struggling amid financial and
intellectual penury.
The Bryan men are dazed by this turn
of affairs. . They are unable to understand
how others should be more obedient to the
ethics of political life than they. It is a
hard lesson and it is being sorely pressed
upon the minds of the Bryanistic min
ions.
The old Democratic ship was somewhat
weather-worn and storm-beaten to be
sure, but it was still seaworthy to a con
siderable degree and with its former vet
eran crew, inspired by the principles which
had perpetuated its existence for nearly a
century, it had a fighting chance in the
Presidential battle now raging. With an
inexperienced pilot at the helm, with raw
lubbers aboard and with compass and
charts cast adrift, there is a certainty of
disaster at the close of the voyage. Bo
far as the genuine Democrats of the coun
try are concerned the salvage from the
wreck will not be worth mentioning.
In twenty-six years we have collected
from the tariff 84,000,000,000. That is
an appalling sum. Our people have paid
out to foreigners for foreign shipping
about 84, 100,000,000. The larger part
of this vast sum of money could have
been paid to our own people. It should
have been kept in our own country, and
would have been If we had extended the
proper protection to American ship

States Senator of West Virginia.

tunity and you will emerge from yoÂ«r
awkward position with honor. Neglect it,
and your political career will be virtually
closed.
You have received honors and favors
from the Republican party in the past,
It has twice elected you to the office of
Sheriff. In the days when you received
those favors at the hands of Republicans
you were most earnest in urging all mem
bers to support and maintain party or
ganization. Why are you less earnest
now? There are reasons for believing you
are not without political ambitions which
look to the future. These may be just
and legitimate, we do not dispute it, but
can you with any fairness or equity ask a
united Republican support hereafter if at
this juncture you seek to divide and
weaken the party when with union vic
tory would be within its grasp?
You have before you good examples to
guide you to right action. Horace Davi a
retired from the position you now hold
when he saw it threatened Republican
success. Mr. Sonntag, who was chosen to
succeed him, loyally bowed to the author
ity of the State Central Committee and
declined to leail a faction in opposition to
its decision. These men walked the plain
path of political duty. What do you in
tend to do? You know you cannot be
elected. You know you can only aid the
Buckley or the Rainey Democrats to de
feat Colonel Taylor. Are you willing to
do that?
Mr. Laumeister, all loyal Republicans
expect you to retire from your false posi
tion. They expect you :to act like Mr.
Davis and Mr. Sonntag, In the interests of
party harmony. They expect; you to as
sist in defeating the Democratic bosses
and in electing Colonel Taylor. The path
of duty is plain. It is easy to walk, and it
leads to honor and preferment.
We intend to support this Government
by taxes upon foreign imports and in
ternal- revenue, and we intend to have
enough revenue in the public treasury,
if the people elect us to power, to pay
our bills. The Government is just like
an Individualâ -when: it has not enough. 7
income to pay its expenses it has to give
its notes to raise money. It ; has to do
that or quit buÂ»ine*s ; and ', when the
Government of the United States has not
enough money to pay its running ex

A LESSON FOR POPULISTS.
The Populists of California can find a
profitable lesson in the news from Georgia,
if they are wise enough to heed it. The
Democrats of that State, secure in their
power and able by their absolute control
of the entire electoral machinery to count
out and to count in whom they choose,
have shown how much they care for Pop
ulist fusion. They are willing to use it in
National affairs to elect a Democratic Presi
dent, but they are not willing to give it
any share of the spoils.. In weakness,
Democracy takes the trouble to bunko the
Populists, but in power it settles them
with a bludgeon.
The treatment of the Populists by the
Democrats of Georgia is not essentially
different from the treatment of Mr. Wat
son by Bryan and his Democratic man
agers. To all arguments of Mr. Watson
they have turned a deaf ear. They have
ignored him. They have humiliated him.
as far as a brave man can be humiliated by
tricksters and traders who, secure in the
possession of power, are able to defy all
that can be said or done by persons who
have no other weapons than those of
reason and justice to defend themselves
from wrong and spoliation.
The Populist's fight is none of ours. If
sincere Populists know any reasons why
they should surrender their party ma
chinery, as well as their party principles
to Democracy, it is right for them to fol
low those reasons. When one considers,
however, that Populism and Democracy
occupy the opposing poles of our politics,
and that no men in the past have been
more bitter in denouncing Populists than
the Democratic leaders, it is difficult to
understand what reasons the Populists
can tind for an alliance with their old
foes. All that is apparent on the face of
it is that certain Populist candidates for
office hope to attain that office by Dem
ocratic votes, and that Democratic candi
dates, possibly for the same offices, hope
to succeed by Populist votes. There are
trades here and there which can probably
be fairly carried out, but the trade as a
whole is bound to end in the confusion of
one of the parties to it. It seems clear
from what has happened in Georgia that
Southern Democrats are determined that
the confusion shall not be on their side of
the house.
We propose that the money of the
country, whether in its various forms of
silver and gold, shall, every dollar of it,
be kept at a parity ivith every other
dollar. We propose that there shall be
no distrust accompanying the dollars,
paper or coin, that this Government
emits or authorizes. We believe that
these things will restore the prosperity
we have lust. We propose to maintain
against every assault the constitutional
right and duty of the President of the
United States to enforce all National
laws without asking the consent of the
Governor of any State. We propose that
the Federal judiciary shall be kept in
full and dignified discharge of every
duty that the constitution confides to
it. â Benjamin Harrison.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
To-morrow's edition of The Call will
be one more example of a true Calif or
nian Sunday newspaper. The qualifying
adjective is by no means one of limitation,
for The Sunday Call admittedly ranks
with the very best Sunday newspapers in
the world. We consider the adjective as
distinctive and at the same time a dis
tinction, for at all times and in all issues
The Call is distinctively the business and
the home newspaper of California. It
craves no higher distinction ; it could have
no bigner ambition. But this is of The
Call in general. Now a word of The
Sunday Call of October 11 in particular.
There will be some novel and attractive
features in this issues that you cannot
afford to miss reading. If you want jour
nalistic freaks and fakes or the cheap
syndicate matter turned out by the East
ern bureaus, of course you will not care for
The Sunday Call. But if you have a
taste for the novelties in art, literature
and science; for strange, out-of-the-way
facts and fancies of genuine human inter
est; for good literature handsomely illus
trated, and for all of the news of the wide
world impartially and fairly portrayed,
then it it The Call yon want on Sunday
morning if you are a resident of or a
visitor to California. A few of the more
important of to-morrow's features are
enumerated as follows:
An Artificial Paradise.
Do Things "Just Happen" Without
Cause?
The Man Who Gathers Skulls for a Liv
ing.
A California Artist in Holland and Bel-
Rium and a XVI Century Aubrey
Beardaley.
A Phantom Dog and a Major's Son.
Encounters With Forest Monsters.
Live Bats Pound Embedded Deep in
the Earth.
The Death and the Gold of an Alviso
Miser.
Some Plain and Fanciful Types of the

To Judge the Brain Power of the Horse.
Women With Shattered Nerve* and the
Medicine Habit.
Telegraphing Without Wires.
Some Secret Appliances of Modern War
fare.
The War of the Milliner and the Man
ager.
This is, of course, far from a complete
list of all the features, and aside from the
new features are the not less popular reg
ular features, such as Whist, In Child
hood's Realmâ always bright and full of
interest for the young folksâ Fashions,
Society, Books, etc.

HELP THE WOMEN OF CALIFORNIA.
The proposed amendment, 6, to our State constitution to be voted upon No
vember 3 prox., has been preceded by the longest and most vigorous campaign ever
undertaken by women in any of our States. A grand educational work has been
done, and our day of victory is near at hand. The self-evident truth and justice of
our cause is making its way and furnishing all the momentum that is necessary to
success. But to bring these facts before the people and to awaken an interest in them
has required many lectures and conventions, much paper and printing, extensive
patronage of Uncle Sam's postal department, telegram and telephone messages, pre
cinct work, petition work, mass-meetings, and many details too numerous to mention,
all of which cost money, so that now we find ourselves in need of thousands of dollars
to finish our campaign and bring us out of debt. We appeal to every friend of
suffrage throughout the State to send in their dollars and enable us to pay our bills.
No State w liege women have ever had a suffrage campaign has failed to pay dollar for
dollar of its indebtedness. Let us have a quick and ready response. Send to

road from Guaymas to Carbo, a distance of

mine in Sonora, now closed because of the
present price of silver, is at the Grand Hotel.
Mr. Prickett is an old railroad man, and was
formerly for eight years with the Texas
Pacific. He says the American conductors in
the part of Mexico where he is receive $180
a month in Mexican money. "For use in
Mexico, " he said, "it is worth rather more
than $100 in gold in this country. Of course,
an American buys very little there. All his
clothes come from this side and nearly every
thing else ; but if a man wants a mealâ dinner,
sayâ it costs him 35 to 50 cents in Mexican
money, which makes it cheaper, really, than
it is here. But, generally speaking, the hotels
are not so good as here.
"The Mexican peopleâ those who labor
want this money to be worth more, so that
they Can buy more. There is a good deal of
interest in the silver contest as developed in
the United States. somÂ« think one way and

would be of advantage to Mexico.

Letters From the People.
DUTY OF CALIFORNIANS.
*o Citizen Should Support the Pnrty of
Free Trad* and Repudiation.
Editor Call: In the Presidential election of
1396 I think it is the duty of the people of the
State of California to cast its electoral vote for
the Republican ticket to repay a debt of grati
tude it owes to the memory of Califor
nia's greatest champion in her hour of greatest
need, James G. Blame, when ho stood by you
and fought for your rights and to protect you
agÃinst the free-silver hordes of 'Asia. Are
you goinp to forget his services in your behalf
and follow the banner of the budding states
man of the Piatte ? Are you witling to follow
the banner of the party that has caused the
American people to be in misery and want for
the last three years, a party that has either a
new flag or a new free issue to give you in
every campaign since 1860 ?
In 1860 it came out and opposed the restric
tion of sluverv and made the threat which it
kept: "That if the Republican party elected
Abraham Lincoln it would establish a brand
new republic, with a brand-new flag and a
new seat of Government at Richmond, Va.,
with a brand-new system of free coinage: and
they did have plen ty of it and its greatest ism,
free trade, saying we, the Democratic party,
shall protect and shield American labor by
making the cornerstone of our new Democracy
human slavery, au'l the keystone of tne arch
a section ia its constitution to show its love
and affection for labor and industry, prohibit
ing protection in its own home industries and
manufactures.
They ran this brana-new free-trade repnblic
for lour years, wnen the firm of Lincoln &
Grant compelled them to close up shop, while
the poor misguided wretches who followed
under the leadersnip of Davis, Stephens,
Yancey and of Toombs had knapsacks full of
free coinage and empty stomachs; free coinage
issued by the Democratic Confederate States
of America as fast as the printing-press could
make it. Did not the Democratic party, the
triend of American labor, especially of those
who go down in >hips (the American seaman),
indorse the destruction of American shipping
by British free-trade cruisers flying the black
flag of piracy which swept every vistage of
American commerce from the seas, since whicn
time England has controlled the commerce of
the world.
In 1892. when our treasury was teeming
with gold and the American people were con*
tented and happy, d d not the Democratic
party enlist under England's greatest com
merctftl Dat tie-flag â the banner of free trade,
wnioh has been used by British emissaries in
every country which has had a protective tariff
and was becoming a rival of England in the
manufacturing trade of the world, and whose
home industries England nought to destroy ?
Are you, the workingmen of this country
and eÂ»pÂ«cially of Caliiornia, goin* to enlist
under this hybrid Democratic-Populist banner
ot free trade and free silver, who have suffered
more from hunger and want the last three
years under the free trade heresy of Grover
Cleveland, to be further reduced in misery and
want, so that you would be reduced to the
level of the low caste labor of India, to the
degradation of the cooly of China, or the
misery and watit of the peon of Mexico and
South America?
Do yon, the workingmen, watit to live in a
hut made of mud and thatched with straw, or
do you want to live in your small home with
your family, having ycur children attend the
free schools of America? Or do you want to
be reduced to the level of the laborer of India,
whose only covering to his body is a turban
and b eechcloth, or to the condition of a
Chinaman, whose only garment is a blouse
and a pair of drawers? That is the condition
of labor in the silver countries of the wor d.
Are you willing to be led into an ambush by
the red flag of anarchy and the black flag of
communism? Do you, tho workingmen of
America, want to go on the gallows, stand on
the deathtrap of destruction to American
labor and to be hurled into financial eternity
from which there is no resurrection?
Are you willing to follow the principles of
the true friends of American laDor â Lincoln
nnd Blaine â in preference to the so-called po
litical principles of Bryan, dictated by an
Altgeld or a Tillman? The principles of the
old leaders of the Republican party are sater
for American labor than the demagogical isms
of the anarchistic, socialistic, Populisiic, Dem
ocratic party. And when the sun sets on No
vember 3, if the people of America does its
duty, we will have a new guard-mount on
March 4, 1597, at Washington, D. C, with
William JicKinley as corporal of the guard,
and our guard at post 1 will be Garrett A.

SILVER TRUST CONSPIRACY
Its Object and Prospective Profit
Stated by an Official
New York World.
Thomas S. Merrill, secretary of the Bi
metallic League ot the silver States, has let the
cat out of the bag as to the conspiracy of the
silver mine owners to unload their bullion
on the United States Government In a letter
he sent to the Salt Lake Herald. Mr. Merrill
says In his letter :
"If Bryan is defeated we must expect to see
silver sold at a price that will be given it
simply by its demand for use in the arts, which
will certainly be not more than 40 cents an
ounce. In view of these facts, the owners of
silver-producing properties can afford to con
tribute at least the additional profits they re
ceive from their own silver product for one
month to the Bryanite campaign." He closes
with a direct appeal to well-known silver-mine
owners, as follows:
"I appeal to Messrs. Mclntyre & Cunning
ham of the Mammoth, Keith & Kearns of the
Silver King, Chisholm and others of the Cen
tennial and Eureka, Ryan & Knox of The
Ajax, Packard of the Eureka Hill, Daly of the
Duly, Wr bu Beck and associates of the Bul
lion-Beck, Farnsworth & Sharp of the Horn
Silver, and the owners of the Sioux,
Ontario (W. R. Hearst, vice-president), and
other silver mines of this State, who can well
afford to assist in this cause, to figure up
the average monthly silver product from
their mines and multiply the product ol
one month in ounces by (54 cents, which is the
additional price Â«they will receive for their
product-all of which will be profitâ and at
once have the amount contributed and placed
in the hands of the treasurer 01 the bimetallic
parties to assist Mr. Bryan ; in . the wonderful
campaign he is making almost unaided. If we
ran secure the additional profits of one month's
product of the Western silver producing mines
It win insure success at the election on No

officially, and with the utmost simplicity the
objects of the silver trust. Secretary Merrill
declares that free coinage of "lv^ means an
addition of 64 cents an ounce-"all olwhwh

every ounce of silver mined! -. .__ . .
The production of silver last year in the
United* States was 55,727,000 fine ounces
Under free coinage the additional won t to
the mine-owners would have been &Â»<â¢>>

the people, not even the miners who dug
the si ver out of the mines would have re
ceived one penny of this additional profit.
It would have been pure velvet to the mine-
The Utah' mine-owners organized last Friday
night and formed themselves into a strong
alliance for mutual profit. A call has been
issued September 28. and last Tuesday night a
liberal representation of the leading business
men of Salt Lake City responded, and several
of the silver mine-owners to whom air. Merrin
had appealed were present. â¢ - : -
The meeting created what will be known
as the Bryan campaign financial committee,
which will be a general committee to have
charge of collecting funds in Utah to assist
the Â« silver campaign. : The committee is
composed of thirty-three members, â¢_ includ
ing those mine-owners whom Mr. Merrill
directly addressed â Messrs. Daly, Packard,
Beck, Knox, Mclntyre, Kearns, Farnsworth,
Cunningham, Chisholm and Merrill himself.
This committee organized at once with R. C.
Chambers, president of the Salt ; Lake Herald
Company, a prominent free-silver organ, as
chairman. Mr. Chambers, Mr. Hearst and Mr.
Tevis are the principal owners, of the Ontario

WHERE GRANT STOOD.
New York Recorder.
Grant was elected in 1868, and Grant, like
all the other great leaders of the Republicau
party, telieved in maintaining an honest
standard of money payment, and in keeping
sacred the pledged honor of the natton with
every man, foreigner or native, who held its
bonds, its paper money, or its obligations of
any kind whatsoever. So when Grant came to
write his fir^t inaugural this is what he said
about it:
"A great debt has been contracted in secur
ing to us and our posterity the Union. The
payment of this principal and interest, as
well as the return to specie basis as soon
as it can be accomplished without material
detriment to the debtor class or the coun
try at large, must be provHed for. To
protect the National honor every dollar of
Government indebtedness* should be paid in
gold, unless otherwise expressly stipulated in
the contract. Let it be understood that no re
pudiator of one farthing of oui public debt
will be trusted in public place and it will go
lar toward strengthening a credit which ought
to be the best in the world, and will ultimately
enable us to replace the debt with bonds bear
ing less Interest than we now pay."
That is where Grunt stood on me money is
sue of 1868. In the same inaugural he recom
mends nit: resumption of specie payment, and
it was his pen that gave the force of law to
the resumption act Of 1875. Not even Bryan
has dared to claim Grunt as a Popo
crat. An"d where Grant stood in 1863,
ana from that time on till the re
sumption act was signed, William McKinley
stands to-dayâ for the good oi the Nation and
the honesty of its money. Next November it
will be found that the American people are
standing there, too, and by a very large ma
jority.
THE FREE VOICE OF LABOR.
Los Angeles Express.
There is no intimidatiou or coercion or
duress exercised by manufacturers or em
ployers of any kind in this country on their
employes. They are not onJy willing but anx
ious that their employes shall hear both sides
of the question, and depend upon the superior
intelligence and acumen of labor in this coun
try todetermine, alter hearing both arguments,
which side should be succesÃiul and what can
didate should be victorious in the coming
campaign. They know that a full and free
discussion will only result in confirming in
the mind of labor the fact that one man is
necessary to the success and prosperity of this
Nation, aud the name of that man is William
McKinley. ____________________

Illiterate Voters-J. T. F., City. The
answer to the following question is found in
section 1, article 11, of the constitution of the
State of Californiaâ "Suppose a man was born
in the United States, has been a voter in the
past, but cannot read the constitution of the
United States; can he vote in California! 7
The section is as follows:
â¢ * * And no person who shall not be

who now has the rinht to vote, nor to any person
who shall be HO years of age ami upward at the
time this amendment shall take effect.âAmend
ment adopted November 6. 18J4.
Phantomnatton âH. T. F., Oakland, CaL
There is no such word In the English language
as "phantomnatlon," although it appears in
the dictionaries. Pope wrote "The phantom
nations of the dead. 1 ' In the setting up of the
line it appeared as "The phantomnations of
the dead," the two words not having been
"spaced" and the error not being discovered
by the reader of the proof. Without inquiry
the word was taken and i.laced in an English
dictionary as a title-word with a definition,
and credited to Pope. The definition given is
"an illusion, appea r anee of as a phantom,"
and it is announced as "obsolete," "rare."
Thia is a surprising illustration of the self
perpetuating power of a compositor's error.
Etiquetteâ C. H., City. The rules of eti
quette say : "Always bow to any one who has
any claim of recognition upon you. This
should be done promptly as soon as the eyes
meet Do not wait to see whether the other
individual is going to bow or not. That does
not matter so far as your duty is concerned.
This rule should be invariable for either lady
or gentleman. The decree which demands
that a lady should always bow first to a gen
tleman is fast growing obsolete and is absurd.
If there be a mutual recognition why should
not the bow be simultaneous? If the gentle
man has been introduced to the lady and
recognizes her while she does not promptly
recall him to her memory, why should he not
by a courteous bow remiud her of his claim to
her consideration? When it is remembered
that the acquaintance need go no further, un
less she chooses, tne reason for tne old rule
falls to the ground. To return a bow commits
no one to nearer fellowship, unless the lady
desires, and therefore it is simple courtesy for
the gentleman to bow at once with greater or
less cordiality, according to the degree
of acquaintanceship. Of course a lady
should never wait for a recognition be
fore offering it herself. A gentleman should
always lift his hat to a lady, and if smoking,
must remove his cigar from his mouth before
bowing. To do otherwise is a rudeness. If
walking with a lady, a bow made to her must
also be acknowledged by the gentleman, al
though the one bowing Is a stranger. Never
fail to return a bow, even though you think it
a case of mistaken identity. It is possible that
you may have failed to recognize some one
who has a claim to recognition, but in any
case it is but a simple act of courtesy." If a
lady has been introduced by a mutual friend
to a gentleman, each has a claim of recogni
tion upon the other the next time they meet,
be it on the street or in a parlor. A simple pre
sentation at a public ball does not give the right
of recognition to either party after tne dance.
If after the presentation and dance the lady
should desire to become acquainted with the
gentleman she will seek the offices ol a mutual
friend to introduce her, and the gentleman.
should do likewise. Without such introduction
neither would have the right to recognize the
other.
GIRL'S DOUBLE-BREASTED JACKET
The pleated back which is preferred to the
ripple shape this season is one of the features
of this comfortable little garment. The shape
is furthermore desirable on account of the
collar, which buttons up close at the throat,
giving more warmth than the tailor-made col
lars and revers.
Plain colors are best liked for jacket*,
browns, Dives and red being used, ad always.
When mixed goods is used small designs or
the indefinite weaving of mottled effects are
generally chosen. The collar may be of a con
trasting fabric or color.
A dark blue jacket with a green collar cov
ered with rows of blue braid set on quite close
and following the shape of the collar was very
pretty. A brown jacket with a brown velvet
collar trimmed with band lace in twine color
was very pretty for a best jacket.

The British Ship Androsa and the Italian Bark Emilie Gampa in Company on Their "Way Up the Coast. The Androsa Beat

Easily.

Says He Will Beat the

OTHER MATCHES IN PROSPECT.
Captain Murphy of the Shenandoah
Beaten Into Port From the Horn
by tbe Jabez Howes.
The British ship Androsa and the
Italian bark Emilie Ciampa had an excit
ing race of it from latitude 16 north to San
Francisco. On that occasion they were in
company Â»nd exchanged signals. Cap
tain Marestasaid his vessel was from Ant
werp and bound for San Francisco, while
Captain Morgan responded that he was
from Caiota Buena, and also bound for
San Francisco* The result of the run up
the coast was that the Androsa beat the
Ciampa twenty-four hours into port. When
the two vessels were in company it was
only blowing about six miles an hour and
there was just enough wind to keep the
sails filled. During the night a breeze
sprang up and the vessel parted company
to meet again in this port.
The Androsa brought up a cargo of ni
trate, and it turned out in perfect order.
In fact, Herman & Mills, the stevedores,
say they never saw a nitrate cargo that
turned out as well. She will take in 3100
tons of general cargo for Liverpool, and as
she has just come off the drydock should
make a quick run. The Androsa has been
all around the world during the last eigh
teen months. From Antwerp s.e went to
Sutidswall, Sweden, in ballast, and from
there took a load of lumber to Delagoa
Bay. From the latter point she went to
Newcastle, N. S. W., in ballast, and there
loaded coal for Valparaiso. From Valpa
raiso she went to Pisagua in ballast, and
from the latter point was ordered to Caleta
Bunea, where she loaded nitrate for San
Francisco. A new patent anti-fouling
paint was put on her before sha sailed on
er eighteen months' voyage, and it
proved so effective that when she went on
the Union Iron Works drydock there was
hardly a barnacle found on her bottom.
Captain Morgan of the Androsa is well
known in San Francisco. He was here
as chief officer of the Somali when Cap
tain Hanney brought her in after her U ng
passage around tDe Cape of Good Hope
While here the captain of the Androsa
died, and Captain Morgan was at once
offered the uobition. He accepted it and
has been in the vessel ever since. He is a
ciever navigator, a thorough gentleman,
and, like every true sailor, very proud of
bis ship.
The men on the Alaska Packers' Asso
ciation's tender Afognak bring down the
best tisti story on record. Tney assert
that while they were in Alaskan waters
"one net at one haul" took in 73,000 sal
mon ; that the average weight of each ti&h
was eleven pounds and that the total
weight of the Bilvery mass was 412 tons.
Not a bad take (or one net, so it is no
wonder that the salmon pack is a very
heavy one thiÂ« year.
The steamer Zealandia of the Oceanic
Steamship Company's line was towed to
Martinez by the tug Fearless yesterday.
She has been laid up for some time, but
lately made a trip to Central America
under charter to the Pacific Mail. A
thorough overhauling has been given her
at Pacific street, but now that the Aus
tralia is due she had to make way for her,
so the transfer to Mi rtintz was made.
Captain Deering will be in charge of tne
vessel while she is laid up and be took his
wife and family along to keep him com
pany. They will live aboard until the
Zealandia again goes into commission.
The bark Alden BeÂ«se and the barken
tine Archer sailed for Honolulu yesterday.
Both vessels are fully loaded and have
several passengers eacli. The captains are
confident that they will make good time
ana Captain Potter asserts that he will
beat the Archer by twenty-four hours at
least. A number of Honolulu people
went away on the Archer, and the mem
bers of the Hawaiian band were down to
see them off. They played several musi
cal selections and sang a number of native
songs, much to the edification of a crowd
of about 300 people who gathered to hear
the music.
Tbe Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Mexico will sail for Puget Sound ports to
morrow, in command of Captain Jepsen.
She takes tbe place of the wrecked steamer
UmatilU and will remain on the route
until that vessel is launched and repaired.
Captain Jepsen ib known from San Diego
to Flattery as a careful and skillful navi
gator and his friends are still congratu
lating him on his promotion.
Captain Murphy of the Shenanrtoah and
Captain Clupp of the Jabez Howes poked
a xood deal of quiet fun at each other yes
terday when they met. Both vessels were
in company off the Horn, but the Howes
beat tbe Shenandoah into port by ten
days, and as an acknowledgment of his
quick work John Kosenfeld presented
Captain Cl&pp with f 100. After twitting
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1896.
Murphy on his long run from the cape
Clapp finally evened up things by divid
ing the purse with Murphy. The two are
brothers-in-law.
Captain Murphy has his wife and
daughter with him, and his eldest son is
third mate of the snip. Miss Murphy
graduated a few weeks before the Shenan
doah leit New York, and this is the first
trip that she and her mother have made
around the Horn in years. The genial
skipper has not changed a hair since he
was here last, and does not look much
older than his son.
When the big ship left here on her last
trip she took away a number of San Fran
cisco boys as apprentices. In speaking
about the matter yesterday Captain Mur
phy said: "Felix Humboldt is now a
cadet on the steamer St. Paul, Harry
Norris tired of the sea and went into busi
ness with his father in New York, Ross
Perkins is now third officer on the s ip
Solitaire, Generaux went out in the ship L.
Schepp to Japan and may now be back in
San Francisco, and Spires is captain of a
steamer. Before his appointment he had
been promoted to the position of third
officer of the Shenandoah, so you see the
apprentices all did well." It will be some
days before the Shenandoah will be able
to deck as it is hard work finding a berth
suitable for the big ship.
The Monadnock goes to the nary-yard
to-day and after a thorough overhauling
she will be turned over to the naval bat
talion for a 48-hour drill. The monitor
will not go out of the bay and the men
will be specially instructed in the hand
ling of the second batteries ana in boat
drill. The officers of the battalion will
remain aboard tbe Monadnock about ten
days and will receive special instructions
in the handling of men and munitions of
war.
The members of the battalion are tire
of the Camanche. She is a white ele
phant on their hands and they don't
know what to do with her. All she is
good for is as a place in which to store
their guns, but as a practice boat she is
useless. The members of the battalion
want the Adams or ir they can't get her
tUey want an efficient crew put aboard the
monitor in order to take good care of her.
The matter is now being pressed in navy
circles and Lieutenant-Commander Tur
ner is in hopes of securing the Adams.

Dr. Birch Will Rejoin.
At the Congregational Ministers' Club on
Monday morning the Rev. Dr. Birch was some
what harshly dealt with because in his address
at the People's Church on Sunday night he
asserted that God as the universal Father
loved every human being and was evolving
mankind with beneficent brotherhood. The
wonder has been expressed that the Congre
gational ministers permitted the attack on Dr.
Birch to go without a protest on their part as
brethren to a brother. Dr. Birch will deliver
an address at the Metropolitan Templo Sunday
night, and Is expected to press home the truth
for preaching which he has been assailed.

To-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock John L.

IT WANTS THE
MARIPOSA GRANT
The Exploration Company
of London Is Look
ing This Way.
Hamilton Smith Coming to Cali
fornia to Buy the
Property.
MANY MILLIONS IN THE DEAL.
Mining Men Are Deeply Interested
in It, as It Means a Great
Boom for California.
Mining circles are all in a flurry over
the prospective visit to San Francisco of
Hamilton Smith, the celebrated mining
engineer and manager. The coming of
Mr. Smith involves a deal which may
reach $20,000,000, and that is the chief rea
son for the unusual interest evinced in his
present movements.
He is expected to arrive in this City
about November 1, coming direct from
London to investigate the Mariposa min
ing grant of 44,000 acres, with a viaw to
purchasing it for the Exploration Com
pany of London, Eng., of which he is the
head managing director.
The Exploration Company is by far the
wealthiest and greatest syndicate engaged
in mining in any part of the world. It is
known to be backed by the Rothschilds,
with unlimited resources, and its opera
tions are conducted on such a colossal
scale that even princes of finance are
astounded at its magnitude. It has many
millions of pounds sterling invested in
South Africa, where its business far ex
ceeds that of any similar concern. Be
sides, the company has heavy invest
ments in West Australia, New Zealand
and the Pacific Coast. Quite recently it
bought mines in Montana ior $34,000,000.
The company owns the Alaska Treadwell
mine, with 240 stamps; the Alaska Mexi
can, with 120 stamps, and the Alaska
Unite ;d also the Oneida mine in Amador
County and tne Lucky Boy in Oregon.
Quite recently the well-known California
mining man, Thomas Mem, who has as
sociated himself with tbe Exploration
Company, returned to California. He
came here und r instructions to hunt for
mining interests and to examine the
syndicate's properties. It is believed tliat
he investigated the Mariposa grant, and
h 8 advice to the home office in London
has resulted in a favorable consideration
of the proposition, since Hamilton Smith
has been directed to come out here for a
personal inspection.
The Mariposa grant comprises 44,000
acres in the heart of Mariposa County. It
came originally from the Mexican Govern
ment In the form o: a gram to General
Fremont, and subsequently it has come
into possession of Senator Jones, Alvinza
Hayward, the Hobart estate and J. W.
Mackay, who paid something like $5,000,
--000 ior the property. A large number of
mines were worked on it once, but they
have been sTrut down while still paying
handsomely. And now these broad acres
of gold and silver ores are about to pass
into the hands of the English syndicate.
The fact that tne company intends pur
chasing tbe property has been admitted to
mining men by a co-worker of Mr. Smith.
It is regarded of so much significance, the
Mining and Scientific Press will say in its
issue appearing to-day:
The absorbing news of the week is the well
authenticatea report that the Mariposa grant
has been definitely offered to the Kxpioration
Company (Limited) of London. This is the cor
poration that lathered the South African gold
fields, the Coolgardie mines of West Australia
and the g;eat dividend-pay inj( properties of
Charters Towers in Queensland and intro
duced them to tbe British investing public.
Senator John P. Jones is now on his way from
the East to meet Hamilton Smith, the English
expert, at San Francisco and escort him oven
the grant. During the past year many mining
experts have visited the grant and made re
ports, but it is reserved for Hamilton Smith,
the highest salaried official of the Exploration
Compauy, to make the final report.
The Las Mariposas grunt comprised about
44,000 acres ov ine direct line of the mother
lode, and right in the heart of the mineral
belt. The title to the property Is derived un
der an old Spanish grant, and was acquired
by Colonel Fremont for a song. After floating
around the plains in the San Joaquin, Colonel
Fremont finally located his grant in the Sier
ras and cast anchor at Bear Valley. After
spasmodic speculation, during which, as a
sort of variety show, many actors made their
bow, the grant settled down to a policy of
masterly Inactivity. The Princeton, Mount
Ophir, Pine Tree, Josephine and numerous

The greatest depth attained was at Prince

SENT TO STATE PRISON.
Criminals Pay the Penalty for Break-
ing the Lawt.
Judge Wallace yesterday sentenced Wil
liam Linehan to imprisonment for life in
San Quentin ior robbing John Welcome.
Linehan pleaded in extenuation that
while he was present at the time the crime
was committed be took no part in it.
Thomas McDonough was given two
years in San Quentin for burglary. His
attorney pleaded that his client might be
allowed to go to sea instead of being sent
to the penitentiary, this being his first
offence. Judge Wallace, however, said
that he does not approve of permitting
criminals to escape, and accordingly sen
tenced him.
Henry Lindley was given ten years in
the State prison for burglary. It was his
second offense.
Norman Scnuller, the young man about
town who swindled his friends out of
thousands of dollars by means of forged
notes, pleaded guilty of forgery. He will
be sentenced on Monday.
LINCOLN CITIZENS ANGRY
Marshal Hill Alleges That G. B.
Bates of This City Is a
Swindler.
Detective E. A. Lucas received a letter
from Ed Lewis, City Marshal of Lincoln,
Placer County, a few days ago, inquiring
as to the whereabouts and business stand
ing of one G. E. Bates, formerly the head
of tbe American Tailoring Company,
located at 30 Montgomery street.
Hill stated in his communication that
Bates had been in Lincoln some time ago,
and had there secured orders for suits
of clothes from eight citizens, who had
made a deposit with Bates and been given
receipts therefor signed "The American
Tailoring Company." Since that time
none of these men had been able to hear
from Bates, and no thread of a single suit
had been discovered.
Hill further said in his letter that he
bad been informed that Bate? was in Red
ding September 22, and was now headed
northward. He was said to have pursued
the same business tactics in Redding and
other cities as in Lincoln.
"On investigation," said Detective Lu
cas, "I find that the firm of which Bates
was said to be the head broke up about
two months ago. The clothing houses in
the vicinity, however, say that every day
a large pack of mail comes to 30 Mont
gomery street. It is doubtless from per
sons inquiring about suits that never ma
terialized. Marshal Hill says he will have
a warrant sworn out and- sent to me at
once." *
Bates' description is that of a man
about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches tall, 40 years of
age or thereabout, dark-brown hair ana
heavy dark-brown mustache, both shot
with gray, and he will weigh about 160
pounds and dresses very neatly. The men
from whom he is alleged to have secured
deposits on suits at Lincoln are: Messrs.
Babb, Shelley, Fuller, Wiles, Wisswell,
Hughes, Reese and Vosbure.

He Was Formerly Director of the

COMMENDS THE GOLD MINES.
He Says in Placer and Elsewhere They

Professor J. Rigaed, a noted mining en
gineer of France, who is president of the
lately organized Ralstons Divide Minine
Company of Placer County, is among the
arrivals at the Grand. He is accompanied
by M. Trancha of Paris, who is also inter
ested in tbe company.
The gentlemen have for several months
been in Placer County, where they have
Deen looking after their mining interests.
"Our property is on Ralston Ridge, near
Forest Hill, and between Long Canyon
and the middle fork of the American
River," said Mr. Rigaed. "It is placer
property, and while we have not bought
it outright, we have bonded it and got it
in shape so we can do so.

lam much pleased with the State. It is
not presuming too much, I think, to say
that tbe gold resources here are such as to
commend the attention of investors gener
ally. Mr. Trancha and myself willleave
before long for Paris."
Mr. Rigaed was for some time director
of the famous mining school at Alais,
France, and for many years he has been a
contributor to the scientific press of the
world. It ia not improbable that he will
be the means of bringing large amounts of
French capital to California for invest
ment in the mines.

O'Donnell testified that he traded the
instrument with which the deed was done

to Kan Francisco. He positively identified
it. Victor Dupont, steward of the canteen
at which the quarrel which terminated
with tbe killing, started, identified the

R. M. Welch of the National racing
board states that there will be no winter
circuit of Eastern riders here this year.
This is not surprising to those who are in
touch with the situation and confirms the
expression of opinion made in The Call
some weeks ago. A cycling writer on a
morning paper came out with what he
thought was a big story about that time,
telling how Bald, Cooper, Gardiner and in
fact every Eastern ride- of note whose
name tie could thinK of was coming here
to race this winter. The Call then pub
lished an article showing the impractica
bility of such a visit for the men, and that
there was little or no likelihood of their
coming. This is now confirmed by a letter
received by Mr. Welch of the racing board,
which states that the Morgan & Wright
team (which is made up of eignt of tÂ£
most prominent riders) will not come, and
that F. Ed Spooner, who managed the
California trip for the Eastern men last
fall, has decided not to bring any riders
West this fail. This is in line with what
The Call informed its reader? about six
weeks ago. Wells, Ziegler, McFarland
and Coulter, the Californians now on the
circuit, will probably come home, and
Johnson and Michael will probably stop
here on their way 10 Australia, but those
who expected to see Sanger, Bald, Cooper,
Butler, Gardiner, et al., are destined to
disappointment.

DUCK SHOOTING.
The Season Will Open on Thursday.
Grand Sport Is Anticipated.
Sportsmen are looking forward impa
tiently to a favorite pastime which will be
enjoyed by thousands on Thursday next.
On that day the law will release its hand
of protection from the feathered game,
which is very plentiful this year, accord
ing to the very latest accounts from marsh
and field.
Wild ducks, and particularly mallard,
are quite numerous in the Suisun marshes,
consequently the sportsmen who have a
predilection for duck shooting anticipate
royal sport on the inaugural day of the
duck-shooting season.
It is thought that the Ibis and Cordelia
shooting clubs will employ the same
tactics of warfare as were introduced in
previous seasons to debar "outside"
hunters an opportunity of killing any of
the preserved game.
The sportsmen of Vallejo and Snisun
are determined to be in the swim, how
ever, and preparations are being made by
them to burn powder on the Suisun
marshes on Thursday morning. Hunters
who do not affiliate with the sportsmen
that have leased duck-shooting lands say
that if their pleasure is disturbed by game
keepers they will join the preserve hunters
in ehooting ducks over favorite ponds,
â¢> w hich have been fed" daily for some
wee ks past.
At jg meeting recently held by the
Sport 9m en's Protective Association of this
City the president instructed the members
to be careful and under no consideration
to enter upon the lands of a farmer with
out first having obtained his permission.
"I am strongly in favor of protection to
farmers," said" the president, "and I also
favor protection for domestic game birds
and animals, such as quail, grouse,
pheasants, etc., but I cannot understand
the meaning of a preserve on a barren
marsh frequented by migratory game
whicn may be found to-day in Suisun and
to-morrow in Los Angeles.
"A duck-shooting preserve, I contend,
is ruinous to the interest of game, because
of the ereat slaughter that is annually ac
complfshed by the owners or lessees of
these preserves. Ponds are baited for
many weeks prior to the opening day of
the season, and as a result thousands of
wild ducks concentrate in those ponds or
preserve-traps better expressed, and when
the day arrives for the slaughter of the
innocents the preserve men sally forth
with their gun?, and a continuous fusillade
is directed upon the birds which flock into
the ponds, from daylight until dark.
"Sacks containing from fifty to a hun
dred ducks may be seen piled up at the
stations on the Suisun marsh on the even
ing of the day of snootinp, waiting ship
ment to this. City, and, gentlemen of this
association, this is what some people are
pleasea to call game preservation."
The Daily Report of the 7th inst in an
editorial on game preservation said: "The
Sportsmen's Protective Association of this
City is strongly opposed to the preserva
tion of game upon reservations, but game
can be saved from extermination only by
the preserve system. It is a case of pre
serves in tne hands of reai sportsmen or
extermination at the hands of pot-hunt
ers and the Sportsmen's Association
knows that as well as we know it."
It was through the intercession of the
Sportsmen's Protective Association of this
City that the Supervisors passed an ordin
ance a tew years ago prohibiting the sale
of certain game which, owing to a defect
in the game law 9, was being sold in this
City at all times, yet the members of this
association are dubbed "pot-hunters" by
some individuals who would gladly own
the earth if they could but grasp that
little wad in their paw. But they cawn't
do it, ye know.
A mass-meeting of sportsmen will be
heid some evening of next week at the
call of Mr. Ahem, who is presiding officer
of the protective association.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association,
looking to the interests of the sportsmen
at large, hss mailed to each Assemblyman
and Senator nominated by the Republi
can and Democratic parties a pledge
Which reads as follows:
Herewith inclosed you will find a card from
the Sportsmen's Protective Association of Cali
fornia, with its aims and objects, which are
as follows:
"The objects of this association shall be the
abolition of game preserves, the enforcement
of existing game laws, and to secure the en
actment of such further laws as may be
deemed necessary and wise; the protection of
the game and fish now found in the State; the
introduction and propagation of such desir
able game, animals, birds and fish as may
flourish in this State if introduced; the en
couragement of field sports among its mem
bers, and to secure to all lovers of the rod and
gun such rights, privileges and pleasures as
come within the province of au association of
sportemeu."
The wording of the pledge it clear and ex
plicit, and if you are in sympathy with its
aims and objects please sign the same at your
earliest convenience and forward to the secre

THE OARSMEN.
What Is Being Done Regarding the
Thanksgiving Day Regatta.
8. J. Pembroke, manager of the regatta
which is to be hela on Oakland Creek on
Thanksgiving day, announces that the
event will certainly take place, as he has
about completed arrangements with the
railroad company in regard to transporta
tion facilities, fare, etc., and is now only
awaiting the Pacific Athletic Association
to sanction the holding of the regatta.
The races will be four in number, and
will consist of the following events:
Senior sincle scull, senior four-oared
barge, intermediate four-oared barge and
senior outrigger-skiff race. There is also
a possibility of a race in four-oared out
rigaer barges between the Columbia and
University boat clubs of Oakland.
The university oarsmen participated in
the Lake Merritt regatta held on last
Washington's birthday and were defeated
by a small margin by the crack South End
senior crew. The Southern Pacific has
agreed to transport the Stocktonian oars
men wbo will row in thÂ« regatta and their

boats to the scene of the races without
charge.
The first race of the regatta will be
called at 10:45.
John D. Phelan will be asked to officiate
as referee, and the other officers will be
men prominent in boating circles.
Next Sunday the Pioiteer Rowing Club
will celebrate its thirty-second anniver
sary. An elaborate programme has been
arranged for the occasion. The event of
the day will be a four-oared barge race be
tween three crefts from the club. The
race will be called at 12 o'clock. The
makeup of the crews is as follows: Junior

FOOTBALL.
Olympic Meets Stanford To-Day
With a Powerful Agrerreffatlon.
Olympic is to meet Stanford this after
noon on the Central Park gridiron in
what will be the first football match of the
season for each team. Game will be
called at 2:30 o'clock with the following
officials in charge: Umpire, Frank Butter
worth, the Berkeley coach and Yale's
Cotton, Tackle and Best Ail-
Around Player of the Stan
ford Football Team.
greatest fullback; referee, Charles B.
Nott, assistant ccach at Berkeley and
last season's captain and guard at Brown
University; linesmen, Captain Harry
Walton of Reliance, the old Stanford
foctbali and baseball star, and some one
of tne five Annapolis Naval Academy
football-players recently assigned to the
Oreeon for regular naval duty.
The Olympics will go into the game
with a very formidable aggregation of in
diviauais. Of the seventeen men an
nounced yesterday by Captain Smith as
likely to take part for the local club dur
ing the game one was a star end on the
Annapolis team last season, one was cap
tain and end for West Point last season,
one was a great tackle at Harvard a few
years ago, one is from :he Multnomah
team of Portland, two have had experi
ence with the Reliances, two have played
on the Berkeley Varsity team, one was a
star on the Stanford Varsity team and two
others had experience at" Stanford, an
other is the beet product of the Peerless
Stickney, Harvard Tackle and
Olympic Halfback and Coach.
Club, while two large, powerful new men
and two old ones are strictly Olympic ma
terial.
It will be seen from this that the Olym
pics nave a remarkable collection of ex
perienced football-players, made up not
by any means from old habitues of the
cluD. If they have team work the reason
able conclusion seems to be that the
Stanford men will be defeated, as were
tne Berkeley men last Saturday by the
Reliances in the opening match of the
season. Two weeks ago, in a practice
game, Reliance and Stanford were a
stand-off. A week ago Reliance easily de
feated a Berkeley team that was evidently
not the very best, that the university men
could have DUt in the fisld, for Sherman,
Simpson, Selfridge and Hutchinson did
not play.
Any inference from the result of to
day's game must still leave the compara
tive merits of Reliance and Olympic and
of the two universities an open question,
for no definite line of comparison can be
optained until next Saturday, when Olym
pic will meet Berkeley. From that game
the relative strength of the "big four"
teams may be more nearly determined.
Both university teams have a way, how
ever, of developing surprisingly during
the end of the season and of showing up
on Thanksgiving in form generally far
superior to that of the athletic club aggre
gations.
The following are the players and their
positions in to-day's game announced yes
terday by Captain Smith of Olympics and
Captain Fichert of Stanford. The stripped
weight of each man is given, in order to
show what he has to oppose in the avoir

Stewart W. Cotton of the Stanford team,
whose picture appears herewith, is
scarcely 19 years old, but he is a strapping
fellow for all that and has a magnificent
physique for football. His stripped weight
exceeds 185 pounds, but it is mostly strong
sinews and but littie surplus flesh. His
playing as end and tackle, both of which
positions he has played on the Varsity, is
characterized by steadiness and energy.
He is a clean, hard tackier and a quick
man on his feet. He gets into the inter
ference well and is strong both in aggres
sive and defensive work. History is his
major subject. He entered Stanford with
the present junior class.
H. O. Stickney was a star tackier on the
Harvard University team in 1889 and 1890
and subsequent to his graduation he
played on the Boston Athletic Club eleven
and last year coached the football team of
the Uirfyersity of Wisconsin, a larger
State university than that at Berkeley.
For the position of tackle he is small, but
ne is reputed to be one of the greatest men
Harvard has had for that place. Since his
arrival in this City several weeks ago he
has been the regular coach of tho Olympic
team and in to-day's game will play half
back. He is considered a dashing, gritty
player and a punter of no mean ability.
The Farragut Football Club of Vallejo
has organized for this season, and its
manager, W. T. Stanford, says it is eager
to play any other team on the coast.
One of the prospects of the near future
is a charity football game between the
Olympic team and ihe navy men. On the
Oregon alone there are five veterans of the
Annapolis Academy team, which has or
late years been a worthy rival of the big
Eastern universities. They are: Reeves,
tackle; Cavanagh, center; McCormack,
cud, and a guara and a halibac*.
THE ANGLERS.
A Hard Journey With Golden Trout
From Whitney Creek to Kaweah.
Some of the anglers who visited Eel
River a few weeks ago returned on the last
steamer from Eureka. They report that
the season is very late and the full run of
fish in the Eel is not expected until the
end of this month. Some fairly good
catches of small steelheads were made by
Frank Marcus and Dr. yon Hoffman.
John Butler and John Gallagher are
expected home on Sunday. Good bass
fashing is still to be had in Russian River
near Duncans Mills and Guerneville. The
best fishing of the season is now being
enjoyed by anglers who are whipping the
Truckee. James Reynolds of Sacramento
writes that he landed ninety-five beautiful
trout in one day's fishing near Verdi.
They were all taken "on flies. "
The following letter is self-explanatory.
Anglers will find it particularly interest
ing: '
Vipalia, Oct. 7, 1896.
Editor Sport: Some time ago I asked Mr.
Ellis, who is one of our Supervisors, to let me
have the particulars of his last trip to Mt.
Whitney, at which place he went after golden
trout. To-day I received the following letter
from him:
Jo P. Carroll Esq., Visalia, Catâ Dear
Friend: Promises once made are never for
gotten by reporters, so I shall attempt to tell
you how' Frank Hill and myself of the Eshom
Valley Fish and Rifle Club, accompanied by
Claude Van Valer and my son, Leonard,
caught and carried some golden trout from
Whitney Creek to the main north fork of the
Kaweah. I shall omit the details of a most en
joyable trip up the grand canyon of Kings
River and across Kersage Pass, and a return
by Independence and Lone Pine to Mineral
King in company with Hon. W. W. Cross and
M. L. Weaver, both of Visalia, to where I met
Mr. Hill, according to a previous agreement.
On Xuesday, August 25 last, we lelt Mineral
King with our outfit oi camp provisions and
four empty cans in which to attempt trans
portation of a few golden trout. The trip was
devoid of any excitement or special interest
until we reached the Kern River, where we
caught some fine fisn, a few weighing over
three and a half and less than four pcundx.
Here we rested a couple of days so we could
push homeward wheu we got the fish ready.
We also made a suitable reservoir in which to
hold the fish twenty-four to thirty-six hours
preparatory to starling. We made the reser
voir of stones and willows and it held some
fifty gallons of water. We also arranged for a
supply of fresh water to run through it.
When all was ready, early one morning we
started, with empty cans and lunch, to make
the climb up "Picayune Point" and on to
Whitney Creek. In about three hours we
reached a suitable place to approach the
water with our animals, and in tnree hours'
fishing we had eignty-seven nice fish in the
cans and on the animals and we were soon
moving, as a former experience proved to me
that unless a constant shaking of water was
kept up the fish, would soon die. The six
miles return was soon made and we lost only
one fish. The second ilay we succeeded nicely
until In the afternoon, when we stopped to
refill our cans with fresh water, but our stop
proved disastrous, for we killed thirty-three
fish in less than that many minutes and only
saved the balance by making a gallop of two
miles to Burnt Corral Meadows, where we lib
erated them in a small pool. The next day
was uneventful.
We reached Mineral King late In the even
ing and soon had our fish in the reservoir,
where we allowed them to rest a couple of
days. While here John Broder of Visalia, ac
companied by William C. Harris of the Amer
ican Angler and Mr. Petrie, an artist, who
were making a special trip to inspect and paint
the golden trout, came up. We placed our speci
mens at their disposal. We were highly
pleased with their remarks and criticisms.
Both these gentlemen are expert fish men
and are probably the best posted trout men in
the United States.
But back to the fish. After leaving Mineral
King we came to the old Atwell mill, then
turned northward and crossed by the roughest
trail I ever traveled several fine streams
which needed fish, but we were bound for
Esnom Valley and could not spare any of this
lot. On the third day from Mineral King we
reached our point of destination and liberated
seventeen fisn, all that was left of our original
lot. If you want work, try to plant fish ; If
you want tun and sport, then go a fishing.
Yours truly, 3. L. N. Ellis.
THE BOXERS.
Kelly and Agnew In Prime Condi-
tion for Their Conning Mill.
The Armory Club will give an exhibi
tion in Woodward's Pavilion next Friday
evening. The secretary of the club writes
that the report concerning "Spider"
Kelly's inability to keep his engagement
that evening with Lon Agnew, owing to
the formation of an abscess under the
"Spider's" good ripht arm, is premature.
The secretary states positively that
pKelly is in prime condition, and if
nothing unforeseen happens between now
and the evening cf the hstic disturbance,
the sporting public will get a run for its
money, as tne contest gives every promise
of being particularly interesting.
Jimmy Anthony will have a very pleas
ant time disposing of Carkeek and Cooney,
who are strong and lusty fellows and ap
parently stiff punchers.
Billy Shannon and Billy Lewis should
put up a stiff punching contest, provided
that they have trained properly, for an
eia;ht-round bout. On the whole, the
Armory Club has a good bill, and no
doubt a large gathering of sports will be
on hand to see the gladiators perform.
BASKET BALL.
An Interesting Came Between the
Rushers and Business Men.
The first game of the series for the champion
ship oi the Pacific Coast between the Rushers
and Business Men was played in the Y. M. C.
A. gymnasium last Tuesday evening, resulting
in a victory for the Rushers by the one-sided
score of 7 to 0.
The Rushers played an extraordinary game,
displaying superior team work, and their sharp
and accurate passing completely puzzled the
Business Men. The latter team put up a good,
stroiic game, but were unable to cope with the
superior passing and excellent interference of
the Rushers.
The first ball was not very exciting, the
players not getting warmed up until toward
the close. The Rushers had the ball all the
time during this half, and succeeded in scor
ing two goals. Klarmann made a close throw
in this half, the ball landing in the basket and
bouncing out again. In the second half the
Business Men started in with a rush, and for a
moment hud tie ball corralled, but the
Rushers soon vrarmed up, obtained possession
of the ball ana Kept it during the remainder of
the game, having things entirely their own
way. Wnen time was called they had suc
ceeded in mating five goals.
The line-up of the teams was as followi:
Business Menâ Finch, L. F. : Day, R. F. ; Good
rich, C. ; Bernhard, L. C. ; Wilson, R. C. : Ward,
L. G. ; Young, R. G. Rushersâ Klarmann, L.
F.; Eastwood, R. F.: Fleisher. C. ; Shaw.L. C;
Marchant, R. C; Mitchell, L. G. ; Harder, R. G.
Officersâ Reftree, H. L. Dietz, M.D. ; umpire,
Edward M. Gorman; scorer, Andrew Arm
strong; timekeeper, J. J. Pfister.
The features of the game were the phenom
enal goal throwing of Fleisher of the Rushers,
who made five out of the seven goals, two from
free throws, and the excellent playing of Goou
rlch of the Business Men.

BACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct 9.â There Is every
prospect of war in the near future in this
locality between Game Warden Helms and
the Portuguese and Italian residents of the
tule districts, as the latter make open declara
tion, It is said, that they intend to kill game
for market The Warden is a stickler in seeing
that the law is strictly enforced, and bets are
even that Helms will come out on top. Doc

in Orogon, has returned, delighted. He says
that pneasant shooting is great sport

There is talk of a great blnerock tournament
to be held in this City on Thanksgiving day,
but as yet all preparations are embryo. Its
success will greatly depend on the number of
outsiders who will care to attend. The indi
cations, are that a small army of sportsmen
will leave the City on the 15th, and that the
slaughter of quail and ducKs on that day will
exceed anything that has taken plnce in this
locality for years, as everybody is going afield.
Visalia Notes.
Editor of The Call: Fully 1500 people en
joyed the defeat of the newspaper men last
Sunday. It was a game of baseball played be
tween the lawyers and printers, and resulted
in a victory for the former. The Score stood 7
to 3. Judge Gray acted as umpire.
Next Sunday the business men of Main
street will play & match gameâ lower against
upper.
Our regular nine will play at Bakersfleld on
the 18th. A good game of ball will doubtless
be put up by both clubs.
The Gun Club's team has returned home
from San Jose and all report a good time there,
but no medals. Now that the quail season is

Property Supposed to Be Stolen.
James Kelly was arrested at the Potrero
early yesterday morning by Officer George
O'Connell and charged with disturbing the
peace. When searched at the station a large
quantity of property was found in his posses
sion, for which he could not or would not give
an account, it consisted of eleven plated pen
holders and gold pens, silver combination
pencils, watch charms of ivory, one gold
watch chain, a broken watch chain, a lot of
spectacles, etc. The police decided to hold
him until the owner of the pioperty is found.
It is believed that the stuff came from some
country store.
FROM MAINE TO TEXAS.
Tl)8 Tide of Public Opinion Is All Favor-
able to Paine's Celery Compound.
Congressman Bell of Colorado One of Those Recently
Restored to Health by Paine's Celery Compound.
There is just now no lack of news from
the Western States.
Public opinion in Colorado and lowa is
as promptly- and accurately heard of as
from any New England State.
From all over the West come reports
that Paine's celery compound occupies
practically a clear field in the cure of
diseases arising from a tired or otherwise
impaired nervous system.
No other remedy was ever used by so
many men of sound and reliable judg-
ment. No remedy but Paine's celery com-
pound has ever been recommended by so
conspicuously fair-minded a body of men
and women. The half-hearted experi-
mental efforts of scores and scores of sar-
saparillas, tonics and so-called nervines,
with which the market is constantly re-
cruited, are in startling contrast with the
confident â because thoroughly scientific â
way in which Paine's celery compound
sets about restoring health and vigor to
the wornout body.
Why will people be silly enough to
jeopardize their lives and lessen their
chances of getting well by taking anything
else?
There is no help so sure and so imme-
diate aa one gets from the use of Paine's
celery compound. Detailed information
of innumerable cases of rheumatism, neu-
ralgia and dyspepsia, completely cured,
has established this great invigorator as
the most valuable remedy those run down
in heaith can make use of.
Women whose stock of nervous energy

Paine's celery compound is the greatest
achievement in modern medicine. It
banishes weakness and pain as surely as
its famous contemporary, the electric
light, dispels darkness.
Paine's celery compound frees the body
of vicious humors- that causa kidney and
liver complaints. Only a great remedy
based on a deep knowledge of thesa
diseases could do the wort that P.iine'g
celery compound is now doing. Better
nutrition for the nerves, an awakened
appetite, purified blood and complete as-
similation â these follow the conscientious
use of Paine's celery compound as surely
as day follows night.
If you are alarmed by a throbbing of the
heart, an irritable stomach, or general de-
bility, be fair with yourself, use the best
means there is, examine what Paine'a
celery compound is doing. It has cured
an astonishing number of men and women
of Bright's disease, rheumatism, neural-
gia, heart and liver trouble. No sufferer
can pass lijrhtly over tne remarkable
record that Paine's celery compound has
to show to every sick and aiiinp person.
Among the thousands of testimonials
received this year is one recently sent by
Congressman John C. Bell of Coldrado,
who says he has used three bottles of this
best of all remedies for dyspepsia and
rheumatism, with the most satisfactory
results. Among the testimonials received
since January there have been no less than
sixteen from Congressmen from different
States.MR. ALFORD HEARS
STARTLING ECHOES
"Where, oh Where Are
the Old Democratic
Leaders ?"
Lots of Them Have Gone Into
the Honest-Money
Army.
LED BY PATRIOTIC REASONS
A Deep Lesson Is to Be Learned From
the Present Political
Situation.
"Where, oh where are the old-time lead
ers of ihe Democratic party?"
If the Hon. William H. Alford. chair
man of the Democratic State Compaign
After Winding the Democratic Battle-Horn, Young Mr. Alford Waits for the Return of the Absent,
but Instead He Hears Some Unpleasant Echoes.
[This picture is from a photograph by Marceau.]
Committee, should speak bis mind in can
did mood such would be his agonized
exclamation.
One can readily imagine Mr. Alford,
aroused from his recent trance, catching
up the Democratic battle trumpet and
Bounding "the assembly," hoping thus to
recail to his support the many stalwart
Democrats who have left his organization ;
but alas! he finds tbat he is not like
KodericK Dhu, for one blast upon his
bugle horn is not worth a thousand men.
The real leaders of the Democratic party
of California have been driven from the
ranks, their pictures turned to the wall,
: and to brine them back will require a
k c <ange of platform on the part of those
who are at present controlling the destiny
of ihat once illustrious organization.
As has been remarked, if Mr. Alford
could be heard to express bis inmost ques
tionings be would doubtless be putting
conundrums for his own solution, and in
many cases the response would be sorrow
laden. Suppose he should cast his eyes
in the direction of Alameda County and
cry out in the agony of his spirit:
"Where, oh t where is that good old
Democratic warhorse, Bill English?"
Echo, masquerading in the form of Ru
mor, might reply: "Bill's at home saw
ing wood and saying nothing. He's wait
in c for a Democratic year."
"Where is that veteran Democratic Nes
tor and able financier, E. B. Pond?"
"Oh, he's gone into the camp of the
sound-money Democrats and is helping to
flood the State with literature favoring
the election of Palmer and Buckner."
"Where is Peter Etchebarne, formerly
of San Jose, now a resident of Oakland,
who for so many years was an enthusi
astic worker in the Democratic legions?"
"He i as declared against Mr. Bryan
and his Populistic platform. He wants a
sound financial system for the upbuilding
and preservation of the Nation."
"Where is William A. Bowden? Where
is Dr. Robert Caldwell?"
"They agree with Mr. Etchebarne and
refuse to train under the Bryan banner."
"How about old Bob Syers, and Senator
W. A. Whitehursf, and Paul Masson, the
?reat wine-grower, and William B. Ran
kin. the successful vineyardist?"
"You'll find them in the ranks of the
Bound-money army, advocating an honest
fiscal system, that will make Uncle Sam's
dollar worth a dollar anywhere on the
lace of the earth."
I "When did I last hear of Governor Jim
Jfrudd and Billy Foote, and what were they
ioing?"
"The Governor was presiding at a meet-
Ing called by the Silver party campaign
committee, and Mr. Foote was speaking
It Metropolitan Hall, pretending to scold
iU old friend, The Call, because he baa
been smoked out of his political tent."
"Any news from Hon. E. S. Liopett, the
old man eloquent of Petalunia, who has
been a Democrat since the flood? 1 '
"Yes; he is stumping the State straijrht
out for McKinley and sound money.
Evidently he believes with Charles A.
Dana of the New York Sun, who, when
asked for his opinion of the Palmer and
Buckner nominations at Indianapolis, re
plied with enthusiasm: 'A fine ticket.
Don't vote for it. Vote for McKinley.' "
"Do you know anything of Editor J. F.
Thompson of Eureka?"
"He's a McKinley man now. Driven
from the Democratic party by Bryan and
free silver."
"What doea Clay "W. Taylor of Redding
Bay?"
"His magnificent voice, backed by his
resourceful brain, has been raised against
Brynnxsm."
"What has become of J. K. O'Brien of
Marysvhie, who was a delegate to the
State Convention?"
"Distributing sound money tracts by
the thousands among his friends and
neighbois, advocating the election of
Palmer and Buckner and asking people
not to vote for Bryan under any circum
stances."
"Can you tell me anything about what
that doughty Democratic leader. Bernard
D. Murphy, of San Jose, is doing in this
campaign?"
"There is no misunderstanding his posi
tion in the fight. He is uncompromis
ingly against Bryan and a debased cur
rency. He stands for the money of the
constitution and the maintenance of
Natioual honor at home and abroad."
"Is General Will S. Green, editor of the
Colusa Sun, whose wise counsel has for a
quarter of a century assisted in guiding
tne Democratic ship, is he doing anything
good for Bryan?"
"Not much."
"Have you tidings from Wesley Mock
of Santa Ro;a?"
"He is for sound money â first, last and
all the time."
"What's the latest message from Charles
Anderson of Santa Barbara?"
"Bryanism doesn't suit him worth a
cent. He will do his best to keep the boy
orator out of the White House."
"Are you acquainted with the position
of tnose brainy young Democrats -Robert
Y. Hayne, Warren Olney, Curtis Hillyer
and Elliott McAllister?"
"That's an easy question. They have
put themselves squarely on the rec
ord as against the insidious evils
of Bryanism. They are with Dr. Ed

"Any other news?"
"Yes, lots of it Dr. J. 8. West of Co
lusa is out for sound money and National
honor. Richard Bayne, the gifted lawyer,
lias renounced Bryan and all his works."
Joseph Allen of Tula re writes in favor
of Palmer and Buckner because he says
that they will draw more votes from
Bryan than from McKinley.
John Roth of Woodville.Tulare County,
is against Bryan.
Charles P. Summer"? of Yolo has turned
out a hard worker in the same direction.
J. C. Lusk of Chico opposes Bryan with
all bis might.
Charles Forman, the prominent Los
Angeles citizen who is so largely in
terested in the street railways of Los An
eeles, and who has been a Democrat of
Democrats ever since he can remember,
feels that it would mean ruin to the coun
try to have the silver monomaniacs in
power.
B. Marks, formerly of Santa Rosa, and
E. R. Lilienthal. the liquor merchant,
take no stock in Bryan.
Evan J. Coieman, president of the Pa
cific Transfer Company, has been looking
over the situation, and has come to the
conclusion that every patriot should strive
to defeat Brvan.
Thomas Kirkpatrick of Moore, Hunt &
Co. has a similar opinion.
Marcus Koshland and Thomas Denni-
Kan, wool merchants, are in the field
against Bryanism in all its ugly forms.
In fact, all the intelligent wool-dealers of
the West who have read Bryan's attack
on the wool industry are going to help to
defeat him. They believe they can bury
him and his pernicious fallacies so deep
that neither ne nor they will ever again
be heard of in American politics.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1896.
FOR FRUIT OR
QUICKSILVER?
Future Use of a Valuable
Tract of Santa Clara
Land.
The Old Guadalupe Mining Claim
Before the Land Office
Again.
A STRUGGLE FOR A PATENT.
Efforts of the Homesteaders to Show
That Their Farms Are Not
Cinnabar Ledges.
The old Guadalupe land interest, involv
ing the ownership of about 900 acres of
valuable soil in Santa Clara County, was
this week transferred to the United States
Land Office here, where the claims are
now bsing heard before Receiver Hackett
and Register Dunn as a special commis
sion under orders from the United States
Commissioner of Lands.
The property in question is located in
the heart of Santa Clara Valley, about
four miles from Los Gatos, adjoining the
Guadalupe mine, and is claimed under
the homestead act by J. D. Mackensie,
Charles Cole, V. A. Scheller, Mat E. Arne
rich, Paul Arnerich, O. Dunker, C. P.
Owen, J. Callunden and J. Doyle. They
base their claim upon the fact that in the
early part of 1880, when the lands in that
vicinity were thrown open for settlement,
the mining company did not file its appli
cation for a mineral patent upon the tract
now in dispute, although under a decision
of the United States Treasurer it could
have done so. The mine people hold that
they were never officially notified from
Washington that the tract was declared
to be mineral land.
In the meantime the Land Office per
mitted the agricultural claimants to make
homestead h'lines, which they did thereon
August 14, 1894, and immediately took
possession. They improved the lands, es
tablishing homes and planting orchards
and vineyards, the territory being within
the rich fruit belt of Santa Clara Valley.
This is the time for t:>e final proving up
of their homestead entries, and the
Guadaiupe Quicksilver Mining Company
now coi. tests the issue of the patents.
They are represented by H. B. Thayer,
agent for the company, and Attorneys M.
D. Hyde and W. P. Veuve. The attorneys
of the agricultural claimants are William
A. Stuart of this City and ex-District At
torney V. A. Scheller of San Jose. One of
these claimants, Mat E. Arnerich, is a Re
publican candidate for the Assembly;
another, Game Warden J. D. Mackensie of
Santa Clara County, and a third, Detective
J. Cullenden of this City.
Both sides have provided numerous
witnesses as experts upon the mineral
and agricultural merits of the case, the
farmers laboring to prove tbat grains and
vines and trees are the only natural prod
ucts of that soil, and the miners that the
lands are filled with ledges of cinnabar
and will produce nothing but the
sprightly quicksilver. Some of the wit
nesses testified that 1600 sacks of wheat
have been raised from seventy acres on
certain portions of the tract and that on
the 900 acres of land there ara at present
thousands of trees and vines two years
old. Yesterday Witness Ryan for the
mining company and a former employe
at the Guadalupe mine gave his testimony
as an agricultural expert that 1500 sacks
of grain from seventy acres was no yield
at all.
Mat Arnerich stated in an interview that
the land in question is worth $100 an acre.
"Some portion of the tract is rocky,"
said he, "but there are no quicksilver
ledges on it. Moreover, our lands are not
in the Guadalupe grant, but totally out
side of the limits, and the mining com
pany only bases its claim upon a decision
of the department, and if it had any rights
under that decision they were invalidated
when the company neglected to file it.s
application. If the United States Land
Office recognized that the company bad
any claim we would not have been per
mitted to tile and prove up on the land.
The fact is, so long as the Guadalupe
Quicksilver Mining Company had plenty
of ore on its grant it neyer cared about
extending its boundaries until it wanted
more rock.
"Woen the Treasury Department de
cided years ago that this was mineral
laud the company could have tiled its ap
plication for a patent, and its excuse of
not receiving official notification of the
decision is not a valid one. When we
made our filings it was Government land
on which there was no recorded claim,
and our little home.", with their fields,
vines and fruit trees, are our own just as
soon as we receive our patents, which will
be in a few das's."
C. P. Owen, who is the Recorder of
Santa Clara, and who is one of the agri
cultural claimants, spoke in the same vein.
He held that should the question be de
cided against them it would be another
case where settlers who had acted in good
faith had been deprived of their homes.
The case will go on next Monday morn
ing at 10 o'clock.
ACCUSED OF ARSON.
David Weil Charged With Having Fired
Ilia Store to Get the Insurance.
David Weil was yesterday accused of
firing his Shasta County store for the pur
pose of collecting indemnity, by the com
panies with whom he was insured.
Answers were filed yesterday to the
suits of Thomas E. Ryan against various
fire insurance companies for indemnity
for loss by conflagration of the store and
stock of Baer, Weil & Co. of Redding,
Shasta County, Cal.
It is alleged in the answers, all of which
are similar, that David Weil set fire to the
store building and that in consequence the
insurance companies are not liable for
damages. _____ _________^
INSURANCE RATES GO UP,
Casualty and Liability Com
panies Form a Powerful
Compact.
Liability and Guarantee Risks Will
Cost the Insured Dearly After
the 15th Inst.
A compact has been formed by the
casualty and liability insurance com
panies engaged in business in San Fran
cisco, and when it goes into effect on the
15th inst. the combine will have covered
all parts of the United States. The Pacific
Coast field is the last to come into the
compact, the delay in uniting having been
caused by the obstinate attitude of one
company, the Frankfort of Germany,
which insisted on cutting rates.
The corporations which have combined
are the United States Casualty, the Em
ployers' Liability, the Union Casualty, the
Standard, the Fidelity and Casualty and
the London Guarantee. Their business on
tne Pacific Coast in premiums last year
amounted to about $250,000. Only one
company, the Frankfort, remains out.
This, it is held, means that a tight in all
lines of liability insurance may be ex
pected.
Rates will be raised by the combine on
October 15. and as the orders from the
respective head offices are very strict and
explicit any infringement of the com
pact's rules may result in a change of gen
eral managers for the Pacific Coast. An
agent of one of the compact concerns
stated yesterday that the change prac
tically made one big company or the six
corporations, as their scheuule rates can
not be altered and there cannot be real
competition for business. As an illustra
tion of the effect of this compact he said
that an elevator insurance will cost $35 a
year in any of the compact corporations.
The rate now is usually $25 in the face of
open competition, but it is believed that
the obdurate company will grow rich on
tne change, since it can raise its rate to
$30 and still be $5 lower than its competi
tors.
The reason given for the combine is
that all the companies found they lost
money last year in writing business, and
that all companies which went into com
petion at reduced rates failed! The old
line concerns had to report a reduction in
their surplus last year. So a compact ex
tending as far West as Utah was organized,
and now it is reaching out over the re
mainder of the territory.
Agents of the American companies com
plain bitterly against the insurance Jaws
of California, or rather tne want of insur
ance laws, which makes it possible fora
foreign company to come into the State
and do business without being required to
put up a deposit, as in other States of the
Union. In New York, for instance, the
foreign companies have each a deposit of
$200,000, under control of the Insurance
Commissioner, and also about $400,000 in
vested in American securities as an asset.
American companies cannot do business
without a capital stock invested at home.
The FranKfort has $100,000 on deposit in
Oregon, as that State demands a deposit.

UTLEY ADVOCATES SILVER
He Calls the Money Kings me
White Metal's Only Real
Enemies.
Figures, Comparisons and Statistics
Ga ore Invoked in Favor of
Free Coinage
The Hon. A. J. Utley of Los Angeles spoke at
last night's meeting of the Thirty-first Assem
bly District Bryan Free Silver Club on the sil
ver question. In spite of the piercingly cold
weather the Populist tent on Market street
was fairly well filled. In the course of his re
marks Mr. Utley said:
"I do not claim for my party all the honesty
and patriotism in the country. I believe we
all desire the Nation's greatest good. The only
trouble is that people are misled, and hence
vote against the best measures. To-night I
intend to speak on the money question, which
is really the principal issue of the campaign.
"This war against silver can easily be traced
to its source. It was set on foot by the money
kings, who were actuated by a desire for a
limited money supply, which they might cor
ner and manipulate at will tor their own ends
and purposes. It is evident that the larger
the volume of coinage the greater the money
value of all commodities will be.
"Gold-standard people tell us tbat if the
coinage of silver in this country were free and
unlimited, our Nation would become the
dumping-ground for tue world's cheap silver.
The truth is if silver were freely coined it
would resume its former monetary value, and
there would be no 'cheap silver.'
"The only question beiore us is whether the
people of the United States can make use of all
tne silver possible to be coined. If we had
every ounce of silver coin on earth among us
herein the United States it would be equiva
lent to fifty-eight silver dollars to each inhabi
tant. France has about that proportion and
is, notwithstanding, the most prosperous
country on earth. In the years between 1850
and 1870 Bilver was freely coined in this
country, yet those years were the most pros
perous in American history.
â¢'ln Europe there is about f1,400,000,000
worth oi silver, coined at a ratio of 15}Â£ to 1.
Asia has millions upon millions, but neither
continent has any silver to spare, and hence
we have no reason to fear a silver deluge from
the Old World. We are warned against an in
vasion of Mexican silver. Well, Mexico has
$55,000,000 worth of coined silver. Suppose
we took it all, not leaving the Mexicans even a
10-cent piece. This wholesale gobbling up of
Mexican silver would give each one of us just
about 70 cents."
Missionary Kxteu.Â«ion School.
The fall term of the Missionary Extension
School lor City, Home and Foreign missions
will open on Tuesday, October 20, at 1812 Van
Ness avenue. The committee has been spe
cially fortunate in securing Professor J. H.
Goodeil of the Pacific Theological Seminary
to lead the class in ihe study of the interna
tional Sunday-school lessons. The class for
the Sunday-scnool lessons will meet on Satur
days at 3:30 p. M., beginning October 24.
On Tuesday evenings a class in personal work
will be conducted, to which, all young people
are specially invited. All who desire to at
tend the ''ay classes are requested to seed
word to Miss M. L. Berry, 1812 Van Mess
avenue.
"Mr. 600" Disowned.
Superintendent Johuson Reynolds of the
Sutter-street Railway Company declares that
the name of Carl Henderson has not appeared
on the employes' list of the company in the
past ten years, and that no one ever offered to
pay him $600 for having cut a cross cable.
Further than that, no gripman was ever dis
charged for that offense and permitted to work
again, even at the rate of $2 10 per day.
This declaration comes in answer to a pub
llshe-1 account of how a gripman by the name
of Henderson accidentally cut a cross cable
and paid $600 to the company for so doing,
whereupon he was retained in the service, and
earned the sobriquet of "Mr. 600."
Approve the Charter.
A "charter mass-meeting" of German-Amer
icans was held at Verein Eintracht Hall, 237
Twelfth street. F. W. Dohrmann uresided.
The speakers were: H. N. Clement, on the
consolidation act: Dr. G. Gubseh, on civil
service; M. Greenblatt, on municipal affairs;
Charles Bundschu, on the merits of the char
ter over the present City government Strong
resolutions favoring the charter were adopted.
CATOR'S RECORD
BEING SEARCHED
Honest Populists Propose
to Repudiate His
Methods.
Said to Have Been a Democrat,
a Republican and Pro
hibitionist
CLAIMS TO HAVE REFORMED.
His People Distrust His Sincerity
and Do Not Think He Ought to
Represent Them.
Populist disaffection is on the increase
over the methods of Cator, Wardali,
Maguire, Lawlor and the rest of the fusion
jobbers, and the Honest masses are wait
ing only for a few leaders to arise in their
independence and smite the jobbers hip
and thigh.
Cator's New Jersey record is being ex
amined, as also his California record by
members of his party who distrust the
sincerity of this ex-Democrat, ex-Repub
lican, ex- Anti-Monopolist and ex-Prohibi
tionist, aud who are suspecting him of be
ing a People's party man for office and
revenue only. When those investigations
shall have been completed the result will
be given to the public by honest and fear
less Populists, who will advise that the
fusion candidates be pledged to vote
against Cator and for some member of the
party who enjoys the confidence of the
masses and wuo has never been accused of
betraying his constituents.
George W. Monteith, middle-of-the
road and an ti- railroad People's party can
didate for Congress from "the First Dis
trict, is making a gallant tight against the
boy orator of Humboldt County and is
making the fusionists and political job
bers very weary. He proposes to denounce
Cator from the stump and to show the
true inwardness of the conspiracy entered
into by Cator witn the leaders oi the De
mocracy.
Mr. Monteith is achieving quite a repu
tation as a polite letter-writer. In reply
to a letter recently sent him by Chairman
Wardali, Mr. Monteith saye:
No, Mr. Wardali, I have no private interest
to subserve. If you can show me how the bat
tle against the railroad monopoly can be pro
moted by my retirement, your suggestion will
be adopted. But when I leave this fight,
whether aow or when the votes are counted,
it will be without any material gain to myself
âyes, poorer than I entered it. You can lead
me with a string of reason, but you cannot
drive me with a ciub of coercion. Defeat with
honor I do not fearâ victory with, dishonor i
shall never achieve.
When this matter is brought home to those
of us who became Populists from principle
it is indeed a sad awakening. That the canker
worms of political pelf and bossism should
thus early attack the stout young tree of Popu
lism may well be viewed by all sincere parti
sans with alarm. There is no time to hesitate,
no time to wait. We must strike at the root of
this evil; we must purge our party oi these
evil ways; we must drive from our midst the
men who would use our power to encompass
their personal aims.
The People's party was not born to go down
into the cesspools and sewers of political
iniquity-to achieve success; it comes to con
quer and not to cower, and whatever may be
the result of the present anxious and distress
ing situation the heavy hand of the pecple
will yet be laid upon those unworthy servants
who have sown tue noxious seed of doubt, dis
sensiou and disaster in the fertile soil of Popu
lism.
Whatever may be the result of this work
upon your shoulders must rest the onus of
whatever disaster may result. You have
shaken the house of Populism to its very
foundation, but you have not and you shall npt
destroy it. In a sense lam perhaps helpless to
undo tne mischief you have done. Were 1 but
able to lay all these facts of this cowardly con
spiracy before all the voters of my district I
would have no fear whatever of results. They
would turn upon those who have dealt this
blow and with that grand weapon of the free
man, the iree ballot, do justice when justice
ought to be done. Whether they will, within
the shorte time that will elapse, be able to
learn all tne facts and fully know the situation
in time to act at the coming election I know
not, but I do know that whether nowor later
that keener sense of justice that lives in every
honest heart will yet assert itself in a manner
so certain as to leave no further doubt in the
minds of yourself and those with you that for
every wrong-doer there is a day of reckoning
and a day of judgment. Yours, etc,
George W. Montmth.
The Divorce Court.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a divorce
to J. A. Poulin from Elsie Poulin, on statutory
grounds.
Mrs. M. A. Sittenfeld was freed from the ne
cessity of supporting Max Sittenfeld. She
complained that although her husband is an
educated man, ne has never contributed to
her support and never purchased her an article
of clothing since their marriage. In fact, sho
alleged that fahe was obliged to support and
clothe her spouse, whom she characterized as
idle and profligate. The parties were married
in San Rafael two years ago. Judge Hebbard
made the decree.
Eva Heff ron secured a divorce from T. Hefi
ron on the ground of desertioa. Judge San
derson granted it.
Dropped Dead in Church.
William Martin, for a number of years past
sexton of St. Paul's Church, corner of Gough
and Eddy streets, was found dead in the
church study yesterday morning. Mr.' Mar
tin was 69 years old and for some months has
been in bad health. He left home yesterday
morning saying that he was feeling much bet
ter. That was the last seen of him until his
body was found at 10:40 a. m. Death was
caused by heart disease.

From the Journal, Macomb, 111.
Theodore B. Switzer is the senior member
of the law firm of Switzer & Breeden oi
Macomb, 111., and will this fail (1596), Close a
brilliant four years' term as State's Attorney
for McDonough County, 111. Years ago he was
severely injured by a fall from a horse, sus
taining a hurt in the right side in the region
of the sciatic nerve, leaving thig portion of
his anatomy weak and susceptible to disease.
When last February's term of circuit court
came on he found himself, from close applica
tion to his business, sadly run down; intact
he was ou the very verge of nervous prostra
tion. Mr. Switzer told the Daily Journal re
porter that while laid up, with no possible sign
or prospect of relief from bis family physician,
he read a testimonial wherein Dr. Williams'
Pink x Pills for Pale People had cured a case
parallel with his own, and he immediately
made up his mind to try the remedy. He
sent for a package and commenced their use
immediately according to directions, with the
result that he began rapidly to mend and waa
soon attending to his business once more.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, In a con
densed form, all the elements necessary to give
new life and richness to the blood and restore
shattered nerves. Pink Pills are sold by all
dealers, or will be sent postpaid on receipt of
price, 50 cents a box, or six boxes for $2 50
(they are never sold in bulk or by the 100), by
addressing Dr. Williams' Medicine Company,

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" vs 1 ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
i but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
.marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
â  weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
______
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 9.â Stocks were in
active again to-day, but the tendency was down
ward. The weakness of the market was some
what of a surprise to the average operator in view
of the renewal of Â«o!d Imports and the heaviness
of sterling exchange. To-day's engagement of
nearly $2,000,000 was an increase from London
which will bring the week's imports up to about
$5,000,000. The amount ordered and in London
since August 8 last is about $53,000,000. Bullion
dealers report a steady inquiry, and - are asking
3-16 to 14 per cent commission. Foreign exchange
-was reduced half a cent 10 $4 82 10 $4 84%, and
ruled weak to the close. As on yesterday, sugar
was the feature of trading, and dropped 2% per
cent to 105 on dealings or 63,600 shares.
- Refined su_ar was reduced another i/g cent per
pound and this added to the bearish teelinir. . Man
hattan and Tobacco were strong in the early deal-
Ings, rising to 93% and 69% respectively. Man
hattan was influenced . by the old report of a deal
with the Metropolitan Traction. Nothing definite
could be obtained and the impress! <n is growing
, that the story was started for speculative effect.
The rise in tobacco was generally ascribed to cov
ering of short contracts. In the late - trading the
entire list weakened owing to a sudden advance in
call money to 8 per ten . Ihe rise in the rate led
to marketing of round amounts of London stock,
and under this process the usually active list
declined anywhere from % to 2% per cent.
â¢ Manhattan fell 23/Â» to 91%; Beading, all as
sessments paid, 1% to 23, anJ tue other issues %
to I V2 per. cent, Speculation closed weak in lone.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Ocr. B.â R. Q. Dun * Co.
will say to-morrow: Distinctly better conditions
have been apparent of late and are reflected in
somewhat larger employment of labor. In large
transactions and in continued buying of : materials
for manufacture. A great part of the change is
due to those resistless laws of supply and demand
which take wheat where it is wanted and gold
where it is wanted. India, Is waiting for cargoes
of wheat on .way from the Pacific states, just as
Australia and South Africa were not long ago.
Surplus usually available from India disappears
and the surplus.lrom Russia and European coun
tries is reduced, according to late estimates, 76,
--000,000: bushels. : Happily this country has a
supply which official reports have not correctly
measured, If actual movements do not greatly mis
lead. . 7 " 7 "./ â '- â ' ' ' : - â â â  â -
Western receipts for the week were 7,243.969
bushels, against 7,351.741 last year, and this fol
lows an increase of 14,000,000 bushels In receipts
during the quarter ending September 30. Atlantic
exportsâ 2,o69,o7l -bushels (flour Included) for
the week, against 1,707,629 las' yearâ ar<* not yet
so large as to lorce prices upward, if .European
buying based on European nerds did not control
our markets. A feature of large importance is
the unusually good demand for corn, which is a
rarely failing sign of deficient crops abroad, while
other grains are wanted instead of wheat when
the latter becomes scarce and dear. It is another
good sign that railroad earnings, amounting to
$38,745,318 in the United States for September
show a smaller decrease than In August â 1.3 per
cent, against 5.7 per cent compared with last year.
Iron furnaces in blast October 1 had a capacity
of 112,789 tons weekly against 129,500 September
1 and 218,306 November 1 last year, while unsold
stocks decreased 35,582. Buying of materials
continues, but Bessemer is a shade weaker, $11 40
at l'ittsburg. .'. â¢; :
The demand for products is so light and so much
does it hold back, pending the election, that de
creasing output is not an unhealthy sign. There
is quite a good demand for sheets, especially at the
West, and ratner better for pieces, and outside con
cerns are getting large contracts in steel and iron
bars and ,In nails, but prices have not been re
duced. â  . â ;â  ;->. \i .-.. .-: â â  â  ',- 1 ,: :."-â  â  â ;.â¢...>'â  â â  â  -

at Chicago 6 per cent for the week to the highest
average since last November. ' Prices of leather
have risen 2% per cent, , with : small dealings.
Shoes are selling very, little, as consumers refuse
to pay higher prices and dealers ; do not want to
buy. Orders for i the nex: season are few and
many concerns may close for a time. .
Textile manufactures are gaining a little and
the buying of wool by large mills covers 7.662,
--tOO pounds for the week, against 11,249.200 last
week. Prices advanced about 1 , per cent in Sep
tember and; have since advanced even more,
though few dealers have orders for long time
Buying of cotton has been checked by , heavy re
ceipts from plantations, 1.222,287 bales having
come into sight In September, against 642 304 last
year. vÂ» The . price has dropped seven-sixteenths,
and few now have confidence in a crop of only

- More gold has been ordered from Europe so
that Â»4,000.!j00 is now on the way. Speculation
in stocks has yielded a little, but r 1.3 for railroads

: COALâ A local circular says: "During the week
there have been 12 arrivals from the northern col
lieries with 24,905 tons of Coal, and six cargoes
from foreign: sources with 17.276 tons. The de
mand shows an Increase this week, but not suffi
cient to show any Improvement In values, as stocks
on hand are ample to meet all | demands and hold
ers appear to be anxious sellers ' Domestic grades
find sale at covering figures, as the quantity here Is
not excessive, : and the stocks are under more har
monious control, but steam . grades ; are simply,
slaughtered and are offered at absurdly low prices,
the actual cost to the owners cutting no figure in
the Mile. Tills slashing of values to effect sales
can only be temporary. : as consumers must now
become generous buyers, and the removal of sev
eral unsold cargoes now en route from the market
must have a wholesome- influence later on. Be
sides our Coast collieries -cannot profitably com
pete with the foreign Coals now being forced on
the market, and in the interim they must dimin
ish their output, which must lend I to an early im
provement. â  Swansea and Cardiff ~ Coal freights
have been marked un fully Is ft ton, and vessels
are scaree | at | the advance; this' will lead to an
early improvement in these grades. Crude oil will
have to be lowered 'in price â to hold . its ; trade
against the cheap steam Coals now in the market."

Lord Masham's income of Â£100,000 per
annum is very largely due to the lucky
idea of utilizing the was^e silk for the
manufacture of plush. He started this
industry on a large scale, and was soon
one of the biggest manufacturers of plush
in England. Since then he has turned his
attention to coal; but plush was one of
the main foundations of his wealth.

the scene of the event, becau.-e it is the
parish church ol Rev. Thomas McSweeny,
who organized the first company of cadets
in this City. Since then companies have
been formed in the parishes ot Fathers
King, McNally, Serda and Phillips. Ail
these companies will De present and also

ONLY ONE MORE.
The Usual Rosu't of "Examiner" Cam-
paign Stories.
OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. 9.â A false story
regarding the discharge of twe men irom
the Haywarris electric road vaa published
in to-day's Examiner. It was slated that
a man named FÂ»x was discharged be
cause he was a Bryan man. Another man,
whose name was not given, was said to
have been discharge.! for the same reason.
Bo:h men were asked for their resigna
tions because they did not see fit to obey
the rules of the company. The other
man's name is Scott, and to show the
absurdity ot the siory it is only necessary
to remark that Mr. Scott was a delegate to
the county Republican Convention held
in Alameda three weeks ago.
"The story is ri iculouÂ«," said Secretary
Stone of the electric road to-day. "B<>th
For and Scott were asked for their resig
nation^ because they did not see fit to
obey our rules I notice several of our
men wearing Bryan buttons, and no one
has ever dreamed of talking politics to
them. The case of Scott is absurd, as he
was a Republican delegate a few weeks
ago." _
Glories In Crime.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 9.â Artie Spar
man, the 17-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Andrew Suarman or Golden Gate, is in
the County Jail on a charge of disturbing
the peace, made by bis father. The lad
rejoices in the distinction of being the
toughest boy in the county. He will be
sent to one of the reform s-chools, as his
parents can do nothing with him.
DIVORCED AND WEDDED.
Marriage of "Helen Dare" Fol
lows the Annulment of Her
Former Relations.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Oct. 9.â The Rev.
Henry Victor Morgan was called upon
yesterday afternoon to perform a wed
ding ceremony, in which Mrs. Elizabeth
A. Tompkins and Nathaniel Erough were
the leading character?. Mrs. lirough is
more widely known as "Helen Dare."
In 1893 Mrs. Tompkins ipft her home in
the East to attend the World's Fair. She
was then a weii-known newspaper writer.
She never returned home. Her husband
tried to get her to return to him, but she
refu-ed. He then brought suit for a
divorce, which she did not answer. It is
said that the decree was signed on Wednes
day Just.
Mr. Brough is a well-known turfman In
the East, and has been the official handi
capper of the Pacific Coast Troiting Asbo
ciation at the Bay District track.

GETTING READY
FOR THE FIELD
Berkeley Football Men
Show a Marked Im
provement.
Some Promising Candidates
Among the Aspirants for
Honors.
A HEAVy CENTEE BUSH.
Much Attention Is Being Devoted
the Play of the Forward
Line.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 9.â Football
has been a fruitful source of interest at
Berkeley during the past week. With the
dawn of last Monday morning the season
at the State University may be said to
have fairly begun. Previous to that time
matters were in an unsettled state because
of the non-arrival of the coach until last
Friday, and because of the untrained con
dition of the men as to their muscles and
wind. Since the coming of Butterwurth a
perceptible improvement in the players,
almost to a man, has been noted.
Every day this week there have been
four complete elevens on the held, and
each man has received more or less indi
vidual instruction at the hands of Coach
Butierworth or bis assistant, ex-Captain
Nott of Brown.
Every afternoon the bleachers have been
filled to their utmost capacity. The first
two or three days of the week were put in
sifting candidates and teaching t c men
to fall on the ball. The Reliance team
came out on Tuesday afternoon and \ aye
the college men a chance to line up for
h alf an hour. On Thursday and Friday
most of the time was spent by the first
and second elevens in catching punts,
tackling, falling on the ball and breaking
through the line.
Nott has been giving almost his entire
attention to the men on the line, coaching
each one according to his needs, while
Bitterworth has looked after the general
play.
But little scrimmage work has been
done, because of the apparent need of in
dividual instruction. As most of the men
on tne field are comparatively new hands
at the game much work has been necessary
on each of them.
Ti:e candidates this year, taken as a
whole, seem less inclined to play to the
grand stand than in years gone by, and
they are all buckling down to conscien
tious-, painstaking work.
During the p-ist week the only two mem
bers of the '95 Varsity team who have
come down regularly for praciic* were
! Ransome and Kennedy. Hutchinson has
; been ia.d up with a sprained ankle, Sber
-1 man has been suffering from Â« lacerated
| temple and Selfridge has been nnable to
j play because of obifctions made on the
part of his family. Under the most favor
able circumstances Berkeley will have
seven vacant-its in the Varsity eleven to
nil before Tnankagiving day.
Last Saturday's game with the Reliance
team developed in Houper one of the most
promising candidates for end that has
played on the Berkeley team for several
seasons.
He played so hard in that game, how
ever, that he has been laid up all the
week.
Selfridge being unable to try for center,
the only two remaining candidates for the
place are Birdsall "00' and McDormott
'99. Birdsall is the heavier of the two,
weighing 207. while McDermott tips the
beam at only 192. Birdsall has strength
with hia weight, but as yet he does not
appear to be able to use it to the best ad
vantage. He puts up a belter offensive
tban a defensive play. Archie Pierce, the
veteran center, has been coaching him
daring the pa^t week.
Of the candidates for guard, Ludlow
'99, Greisberg '99, Ankley '98, Shilling '00
and Wilbur 'oo are in the lead. Ludlow
has been doing particularly brilliant work
this season and is reckoned among the
best players on the field. He breaks
through well and tackles hard. He is
weaker on the defensive tban at offensive
play.
Cornish '00. from the Berkeley gym
nasium, is putting up a good game of ball
at tackle. He is strong and heavy and is
not afrsid of getting hurt. His play is
somewhat erratic at times, but he gives
his opponent a bard struggle.
Simpson, ihe promising tackle of last
year, who was debarred from entering
the intercollegiate because nf being a spe
cial student, came out on Wednesday lor
the first time this season. H<" is now in
the medical college and is qualified for a
place on the team. He is one of the
quickest men among all the candidates,
and seems to have a certain spring about
all bis movements that is characteristic
only of himself. Haskell, '98, and Craig,
'99, are out for places at end, in addition
to HuTchinson mid Hopper. Kennedy,
'98, and Bender, '99, are the only two can
didates for quarter. Hail, "99, has been
dome good work at half this week, along
with Eldie Sherman.
Captain Ransome has spent much of his
time while not looking after his men in
making drop-kicks for goal. Yesterday
he made a doz^n or more successful drop
kicks from the for^y-yard line.
The freshmen are snowing up somewhat
better than they did at the outset of the
seasons' work, and indications are that
Berkeley will have a fairly good "'00"
team.
The freshmen will play a game against
the Ban Mateo eleven to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock, on the Berkeley tield. As
the University team as made up for the
contest is the one which will probably go
against Stanford on November 14, much
interest is centered in the contest.
The Berkeley team will consist of Mc-
Dermott, center; W lbur ad fcarnes,
guards; Graham and Eoright, tackles;
Toland and Masters, ends; Austin, quar
ter; \V hippie and Anderson, half-backs;
Sims, full-bacfc; Pearce, Allen, Smythe,
substitutes.

gestion of the brain. He leaves a widow
and five grown children. Mj. Ames was a

the Adult Blind at the time of his death.
Populists Disturbed.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 9.â County Clerk
Jordan has received from the Secretary of
State a certificate of the names of the
Presidential electors ot the various par
ties. While nine names appear for each
the names In the Populist and Democratic
lists aie the same. The Populists are
worked up over the matter, as they fear
that ihe election boards will return the
vote separately on each list, and while
combined they might be elected the Re
publicans would have the largest single
footing and be given the certificates of
election.
A Generator Ixplodes.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 9.â A fifty-gallon

who was at work upon it at the time o(
the accident. The p. ant is s tuated at the
conn r of Thirteenth and Webster streets,
and is surrounded- with residences, wbos*
occupants thought the narrow-gauge en
gine boiler had burst. The cylinder hai
been partially charged with acid and soda
the night before. This had generated gas,
and when Jacobs found a leak this morn
ing in a connecting pipe he attempted to
set a nut tighter. Th first move was the
wrong way, and let the nas down in the
generator, and he was blown into the
air. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and nis wounds dressed. He is
resting quietly to-nigtjt at home.

a fit of am-er the minister struck a mem

THE OLDEST NEW
YORK FIREMAN,
Casslear Hartnett Ran With
Old "15" Sixty- Five
Years Ago.
A'.terward Started the First
Hardware-Shop in San
Francisco.
SUCCUMBED TO OLD AGE.
Founded the Largest Silver Case Con
cern in the Countryâ A Simple
Funeral.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 9. J
Casslear Hartnett, the oldest member of
the New York Fire Department, died in
this city at the age of 83. Sixty-five years
ago young Hartnett was one of the
speediest runners of Engine Company 15
and he remained a member for many
years. In one of the great fires that
swept New York City half a century ago,
before the Greater New York was even
dreamed of, the brave young fireman
nearly lost his life. He was busy on a
roof that collapsed and he went down
with the debris. How he escaped he never
knew. He was. seen by several firemen,
who managed to extricate him from the
rums before he was entirely covered.
Hartnett was unconscious wnen drageed
from the burning timbers, but lived to
tell the story to two generations.
When San Francisco was young and
houses were beginning to take the place
of tents ana shanties Mr. Hartnett ad
vanced the money to a friend, who started
the first hardware-store in that city.
After leaving active service in the New
York fire department Mr. Hartnett, with
his son, started a jewelry establishment in
that city and soon had the largest store of
'hai kind in the East. For many years he
;lade all the jewel-cases for Tiffany, and
be silver cases that h* designed person
jly and made for the jewels presented to
lorn Thumb by Queen Victoria were as
much admired as were the jewels. When
all the silver work that is now done by
machinery was done by hand Hartnet. &
Son were the most prominent merchants
in that line in the country, and their
patrons were to be found all oyer the con
tinent.
Eight years ago, when Mr. Hartnett had
just completed three-quarters of a century
of active life, his health began to fail and
he came to California and took up a pe r
manent residence. He made many
friends, but his failing health and advanc
ing age prevented him from appearing in
public to any extent. He passed away
very quietly, with his wife and only son in
attendance at his bedside.
The funeral this afternoon was very
quiet and simple. It was Mr. Hartnett's
wish that there should be as little cere
mony as possible, and his desire was re
spected.
A requiem high mass was celebrated at
St. Mary's, Rev. Father .Brown being the
officiating dignitary. The pall- bearers
were: David Newberry, Martin Walsh,
Odie Storer, J. Ptiaro, W. D. Thomas and
W. G. Dinsmore.
The deceased left quite a large estate,
which is nearly all in real property in New
York State. His only son, fasslea* 1 M.
Hartnett, is in the office of the Contra
Costa Water Company.
The remains oi the deceased were placed
in the receiving vault, and will be finally

HORSEMEN FORM A TOWN

Regarded as Cer
tain.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Oct. 9. J
The information regarding the action of
various church bodies and their attitude
toward racing and poolselling, published
in The Call recently, has resulted in an
attempt to incorporate a new town. The
article referred to stated that as a majority
of the Supervisor- were to be elected next
month an effort would be made to pledge
j them to vote against the Belling of pools
anywhere in the county.
The experience of the past has been that
whenever the church people of this city
are a unit on any proposition they can
secure the passage of any legislation look
ing toward reform that they desire. It
was evident that the Ministerial Union
and the Christian Endeavor Union would

oppose the selling of pools on the track or
elsewhere, so a radical move was hastily
decided npon.
One ween ago Em >ryville was con
tented as it is ; now everybody is discussing
tbs necessity of incorporating as a town.
The proceedings have been undertaken
by those interested in the racetrack, and
who have invested $250 000 at Emeryville.
The move is made und'-r the municipal
corporation act of 1893. The petition will,
by provision of tnat measure, be pub
lished for fourteen days, and then the
[Supervisors will have the boundaries offi
cially located by the County Surveyor,
and will call an election in the district
proposed to be incorpoiatÂ°d. Should the
necessary vote be obtained the new town
will be in existence.
The official description of the boundar
ies of the proposed town is as follows:
Beginning at a point on the northern boun
dary of the city of Oakland, 150 feet easterly
from the easterly line of Ban Pablo avenue,
measured at a right angle to the said line of
Ban Pablo avenue, and running thence north
erly parallel with and 150 teet distant from
said line of San Pablo avenue to a point 150
feet easterly from the easterly line
of Adeline street, measured at a rigHt
angle to the said line of Adeline
street, thence northerly parallel to and
distant 150 feet from said live of Adeline
street to a point 150 feet distant easterly from
and measured at a right angle to the east
eny line of Lowell street, thence northerly
parallel with and distant 150 feet from said
line of Lowell street to the southern boundary
ol the town of Berkeley, thence westerly fol
lowing the southern boundary of the town of
Berkeley to its intersection with the northern
boundary of the city of Oakland, and thencf
easterly along said boundary of the city oe
Onkiand to the beginning.
Should the voters so decide the result
will be the establishing of a local self
government as independent as any other
town in the county. Tne law provides
that a territory in order to incorporate
must not nave less tban 500 residents.
The proposed town will have about 1200.
The limits include Golden Gate, Shell
Mound, Emeryville and Bay District.
Another r-ason for the incorporation is
the fear that has prevailed in Butcher
town for some time that the slaughter
houses might be compelled to move. All
the territory on which the slaughter
houses are located is included in the pro
posed limits.

The reports of the grand master, jrrand
secretary, treasurer and other officers,
with the appointment of committees, will
occupy all of Tuesday.
The gathering oi the Masons from all
parts of the State this year has an unusual
significance in the fact that a buiiding is
about to be erected, under which the
widows and orphans of Master Masons
may find a home should circumstances be
such as to cause them to look for food and
shelter from the members of the fraternity.
The laying of the cornerstone, which
will take place on Wednesday, will signal
ize one ot the most important epochs in
the history of Masonry in California. It
has been deemed proper to hold it wnile
the Grand Lodge is assembled in San
Francisco, and to mark it by an imposing
Masonic demonstration. Arrangements
have been made for special rates from ad
jacent points on the railroad.
By special invitation of the grand
master, the Grand Lodge will be escorted
from the temple to the ferry by ail the
Masonic bodies in San Francisco. A
special detail of Masons will be provided
EDWARD PEABODY, Who Wili Be the Grand Marshal of the
Procession on Next Wednesday at the Laying of the
Cornerstone of the Widows' and Orphans' Home at Decoto.
to look out for ladies who may be without
escorts, both at the ferry landing and at
Decoto,- and members can send their
families direct to the 10 o'clock boat,
where they con join them aiter the parade
and remain with them until arrival at
Decoto, wheie conveyances will be in
waiting to take tne ladies to the grounds.
Tickets can be procured at any of the
Southern Pacific Company's ticket offices
on the morning of the 14th, but as a mat
ter of courtesy to Alameda Lodge, which
is preparing the refreshments, and that it
may know approximately now many to
expect, it is requested that ao far as pos
sible ti'jfcets be purchased in advance from
the Â«Â°cretary of the Grand Lodge, or from
the of the board of relief at the
Masonic Temple, Post and Market streets.
At the conclusion of the cÂ«reraony there
will be a grand barbecue and clambake,
prepared by Uameda Lodge, to which
all are cordially inviied.
The question of erecting a' home for the
widows and orphans of the Masonic fra
ternity has been agitated in and out of
the Grand Lodge of Master Masons for
quite a number of years, until ultimately
ihe good intentions of those interested in
the scheme assumed definite shape when
the most worshipful grand master ap
pointed a board of trustees from among
the most prominent Masons in the juris
diction, composed as follows: Charles L.
I'attou. president; Colonel Fred Crocker,
vice-president, and Jacob Voorsanger â all
of San Francisco; N. Green Curtis and Wil
liam Johnston of Sacramento; W. Frank
Pierce, Oakland; Judge F. M. Angelotti,
can Rafael; Edwin W hippie, Decoto
(Alameda), and George Hinds, Los An
geles.
Those gentlemen, immediately upon re
caiving their appointments, proceeded to
carry into practical shape the long cher
ished hope of their brethren, and without
delay located the present site of Decoto,
where the home will be erected.
Tne tract of fine land secured and for
which $40,000 has been paid consists of 260
acres, well fenced and supplied with water,
and with water privileges outside of its
j inclosure. Ten acres of this the Masonic
j brethren iv the neighborhood have gener-
I ously offered to plant in fruit trees of the
! finest quality and choicest varieties with-
I out charge whatsoever.
The main building will be 160 feet in
length and 60 feet in breadth, and will
I Wiien completed accommodate not less
i tlian 100 inmates. An ample building in
the rear will be crectel for kitchen, dining
room, storeroom, etc., while a large reser
voir on the hills above will be kept sup
| plied with abundance of water from
i springs beyond, to be a sufficient supply
jin time of drought or in case of fire. All
1 the modern appliances and conveniences
will be placed in the home, so that there
will be no cause for complaint on that
srore by the beneficiaries. The basement
â  will be fitted up for storerooms, and a
| place for the children to play in when the
weather is stormy and they cannot play
out of doors.
There will be no expense of education
of the orphans at this institution. The
public school near at hand is a graced
one, and they will be there educated and
drink at the public fount of learning in
common with the rest of the children of
that public sc? 00l district, and thus in a
small way have intercourse with the
world.
Habits of industry will be inculcated,
and in a great measure the home will be
self-supporting from the products of the
farm, the agricultural department being
placed in charge of an intelligent, com
petent and experienced former as over
seer and director of the labor bestowed in
a proper cultivation of the soil.
There is an abundance of fresh water
upon the grounds for all purposes, but the
trustees, with an eye to the future and
that there should be no 6tint of an abun
dant supply of this life-giving fluid, pur
j chased two acres of land, upon which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1896.
there is an everlasting spring of sweet
water, and from this source a two-inch
pipe a mile in length has been laid, bring
ing a supply of 15,000 gallons of water
daily into all parts of the building, as
also about the cultivated portions of the
grounds.
There has been expended already upon
the site $5000 for grading and a similar
amount in putting down the foundation,
leaving yet $50,000 to be expended before
the home will be turned over to tne
trustees.
Every dollar of this $100,000 has been
contributed by the Grand Lodge, subor
dinate lodges, chapters, councils, com
manderies, bodies of the Ancient and
Accepted Scottish Rite, grand and subor
dinate, and even the Five Points of the
Eastern Star have gone j n t o fellowship
and embraced in this gloiious undertak
ing ol providing this Masonic Widows'
and Orphans' Home, which is no longer
to be a "hope deferred that maKeth the
heart sick," but to make a start which
will have a finish that will bring Joy to
not only the Masons of California but
their brethren throughout the United
States, and in the four corners of the
universe, for that matter, as the fraternity
extends all over the earth.
Too much praise cannot be given to
Charles L. Patton, president of the board
of trustees and past master of California
Lodge No. 1, for the part which he has
taken in bringing about the grand event
which will be consummated on next
Wednesday when the most worshipful
grand master, E. M. Preston, shall pro
nounce the corner&tone to be "well and
truly laid."
President Patton, as president ot the
board of trustees in whose charge the erec
tion of the building and through whom
the Grand Lodge of Masons has been in
vited to participate, has appointed Edward
Peabody as grand marshal of the proces
sion next Wednesday.
The Grand Lodge and all subordinate
bodies taking part in this affair will, as is
customary, have their own marshals, but
Brother Peabody will have absolute charge
of the entire procession from the time it
leaves the Masonic Temple until it returns
in the evening.
It is scheduled for the train to reach
Decoto at 11:15 o'clock. Here a proces
sion will be formed and a march of about
three-quarters of a mile undertaken,
which will bring them to the site upon
which the home will be erected.
Colonel Fred Crocker, wno is an ac
tive member of the craft, nas made ar
rangements by which suitable transporta
tion facilities will Dt. provided at the mole
for all who wish to participate in the
celebration. Grand Secretary George j
Johnson's estimate of tne number of Ma- â 
sons who will participate on the occasion
is about 5000. San Jose alone wili con
tribute 200 from her lodges. The railroad
company has fixed the fare for the round
trip at 70 cents.
The cornerstone will be put in place '
according to the ancient usages of the
Masonic brotherhood, in the northeast
corner. This ston?, which will be lowered
into place by the grand master, has been
tenerousiy donated to the good cause by
the Raymond Granite Company.
HUNGER IS AN ANARCHIST
Rabbi Voorsanger Lectures on
Workingmen and
Idleness.
He Believes Cities Should Estab ish
Schools of Industry in Self-
Protection.
Rabbi Voorsanger delivered a lecture at
the Temple Emmanu-El iast night on
"The Moral and Social Relations of Work-
I ingmen."
Without announcing any radical views
or making any specific attack on existing
institutions the speaker took the broad
! ground that the workingmen of thiscoun
j try are as moral and patriotic a class as
I any other in the country.
"There have been three great revolu
tions affecting society in modern times â
I the German revolution of the fifteenth
i century and the French and American
I revolutions of the eighteenth century.
"The result of these great revolutions
was the destruction of classes and the
opening of opportunities for the masses,
and since these revolutions ability rather
than birth has been the test oi men's right
to advancement. In this age brain rather
than birth gives men the right to promo
tion.
"In the sreat republic of usefulness,"
said the speaker, "Drains may raise the
humble shopkeeper to the position of
king, and i the only aristocracy now is that
of mind."
The speaker argued that the chief solu
tion of industrial troubles and social evils
must be sought in a wider ethical and
general education. "If the moral tone
and mental ability of the musses fail,"
said he, "there will be general trouble.
There must be culture and there ought to
be schools for the education of the idle
and vicious in cities, places that are open
nights as an opposition to places of vice.
The education of the masses is our safety.
There is no greater anarchist than hun
ger and no greater teacuer of nihilism
than idleness."
WILL REMAIN CLOSED.
Supervisors Decline to Legislate in
Favor of Morton-Street liens.
The Health and Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors declined yesterday
to atk Chief Crowley to withdraw his sur
veillance from Morton street, and in con
sequence the dens of that thoroughfare
will remain closed.
George O'Neil, John Bauman and Mrs.
Theiss appeared before the committee to
urge that the petition of the property
owners to be allowed to open their houses
ior lodging be granted and that the police
be withdrawn.
The committee decided that it had no
right to interfere with the police and
placed the petition on file.

POKING AMONG
THE JUTE BAGS
Governor Budd and the
Prison Board Make
Investigations.
Impending Shake* Up in the
San Quentin Convict
MilL
PROBABLE LOPPING OP HEADS.
The Directors Are Not Satisfied With
the Way the Factory Has
Been Running.
Governor Budd and the fall board of
Prison Directors spent the entire day at
San Quentin prison yesterday, ostensibly
investigating the case of the Cummings
boys, whom the Governor recently re
spited until October 30, and some other
cases of parole and pardon. In reality,
however, his visit was to make an inspec
tion and investigation of the affairs of the
jutemill, and as a result of this visit yes
day there will be a lopping off of heads at
the next regular meeting of the board that
will bring consternation into the ranks of
the higher officials of that prison indus
try as well as into the working forces who
are under salary.
The Governor also took a ride over the
five miles of the completed portion of the
fourteen miles of the proposed boulevard
between San Rafael and Tiburon. Tnen
he acted as a soit of host to a party of
visitors from Los Angeles who accompa
nied the Governor from San Francisco,
and who made a tour of the prison. Alto
gether it was a busy day for the Governor,
but despite the onerouiness of tne duties
which he imposed upon himself yester
day, be was modest withal about it and
did not permit his left hand to know what
his right was doing. In other words, the
proceedings of the special session of the
board was not intended to be made public
In fact it was intended to be of an execu
tive character, its business being not to
act on any proposition, but simply to lay
the groundwork for some very important
future action.
Last December with a view to improv
ing the system of operation in the jute
miii and increasing its product thereby,
the iiovernor appointed John Rutherford
as superintendent in place of the former
official who acted in that capacity, and
also replaced the old spinners with a new
corps. No improvement was perceived
despite the sweeping changes that had
been made but the Governor and the mem
bers of the board decided to abide in pa
tience for a while and give the new force
every opportunity to make a showing.
But the pas^-iug of time only left matters
in a worse condition. Results only were
looked after and these were far from satis
factory. In fact the output of the jutemill
to-day is even less than it was under the
former regime.
Patience at last ceased to be a virtue,
and so yesterday the Governor took a day
on to go through the mil! and make a per
sonal inspection of it. What he and the
directors saw crystallized their purpose,
and when the board next meets in regu
lar session, which will be on the second
Saturday in November, there will be a
complete turning out and over of the sal
aried force in the jutemill with perhaps a
few exceptions.
Four cases of commutations and par
dons were also discussed by the board.
The most important of these was the case
of the Cummings boys, who were con
victed of the murder of an old man named
Narramore, near Riverside, and sentenced
to be hanged on September 25. On Sep
tember 24, however, the doomed men were
respited until the 30th inst.
Having mentally disposed of the jute
mill matter, the Governor had a long
talk with Caesar and John W. Cummings,
and was visibly impressed with their
story. It is the* general impression that
the result of the Governor's interview
with the boys will be another respite on
the 30th and then a commutation of the
death penalty to life imprisonment.
Another case that was considered at
length was that of John Henley, con
victed of murder in the second degree in
Humboldt County. He was sentenced to
life imprisonment twenty-one years ago.
His conduct since has been of the most
exemplary character. He is pronounced
to be one of the best prisoners ever con
fined within the walls of the San Quentin
prison. Jlis sentence wiil probably be
reduced to thirty-three years and some
months, which with the credits deducted
will make him a free man when the board
holds its next session.
The case of Thomas Sullivan, sentenced
to a lone term on conviction of robbery in
Kern County, was heard, but the prison
er's defiant manner did not favorably im
press the board.
The fourth case that was considered was
that of Rajinski, convicted of arson in
San Francisco. He has become a hope
less cripple in jail. Great interest has
been shown in his case by the Jewish
people of San Francisco, where the con
victed man left a wife arid two children.
A letter has been received by the board
from the brother of the prisoner, who is a
wealthy manufacturer in Pennsylvania,
in which the brother agrees to take care of
his r?lativf and his family, pay their ex
penses to Pennsylvania, and pee that the
convicted man does not return to Cali
fornia. His case will in all probability r -
ceive favorable consideration, and his par
don be made out at the board's next meet
ing.
Among the party which accompanied the
Governor to Ban Quentin were: John W.
Mitchell and wife of Los Angeles, A. W.
Foster, president of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Railroad, and Labor
Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald. After the
party had driven over tne new boulevard

FOR A NEW CHURCH.
The Sacred Heart Bazaar in Armory
Hall liikely to Prove a Suc
cess.
The bazaar in aid of the Sacred Heart
Church, now beine held in Armory Hall,
on the corner of Gough and Page streets,
bids fail to successfully attain the end for
which it was arranged. The steady at
tendance during the week has induced
those in charge to keep the bazaar open
another week.
Last evening it was St. Joseph's booth
night "at home" and a neat and selected
programme was rendered. To-nigbt sev
eral new features will be added to the
bazaar.
The saber contest among the various
League of the Cross officers is still an ex
citing affair, over 1000 votes having been
cast For the various officers.
A most successful contest for a gold
watch among the young ladies also de
mands the attention of all. Miss Clara
Fay is in the ltad, with Miss Byrne a close
second.
The various booths are tastefully ar
ranged, and contain articles that are both
ornamental and useful.
Lunch is served by the young ladies from
12 to 2 o'clock daily. The refreshment
booth attendants beg leave to announce
that they wiil serve a tamale supper this
evening.
The young men have successfully ar
ranged a paper known as The Daily
Record, containing all the fair's news. It
comprises; eight good-sized pages of ex
cellent reading matter.
Father Flood requests all that are in
sympathy with his movement â the build
ing of the new church â to visit the festival
and financially aid the ladies in charge.
GAS COPMPANY'S NEWHOME
A Classical Edifice of White
Brick, Terra Cotta and
Marble.
Expectation That the Offices Will Be
Ready for Use by the Early
Part of Next Year.
It is expected that by the Ist of Feb
ruary, 1897, the new home of the San
Elevation of the Ne^ Building for the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company.
Francisco Gas and Electric Company will i
be ready for occupancy. Already the
handsome building has reached the upper
cornice, and in a very short time the roof
will be put on, after which the work of
completing and decorating the interior
will be commenced.
The location for the new building has
been happily selected, the site on Post
street, above Powell, being central, while
at the same time removed from the din of
the main business thoroughfares.
The edifice will consist of three floors
and a basement. The basement and first
floor will be faced with white granite. In
the basement will be the stores of the gas
stove department, the first floor being oc
cupied by the public offices.
The second floor will be devoted to
rooms for the directors, stockholders, en
gineers and draughtsmen, while the upper
floor is destined for the accommodation of
collectors, biilmakers and other clerical
employes.
The two upper floors will be faced in
white brick with white terra cotta col
umns, pilasters and winaow-caaines. The
general aspect of the facade will be Ro
man, the columns being fluted with Doric
capitals. The woodwork of the interior is
to be in oak with bronze trimmings. Mar
ble wainscoting to the height of six feet
will line all the walls, and the floors will
be of fancy tiling and marble mosaic.
Work on this hand-ome new building is
being prosecuted as rapidly as is consist
ent with the requisite thoroughness, and
property-owners in the vicinity are jubi
lant over the prospect that the imposing
edifice: will contribute to heighten the
value of their holdings.
A Large Party of Tourists
Recently visited Paso Robles for the first time
and were so charmed that they declared it to
be the grandest of all health resorts. The
mild, delightful climate, the superb hotel and
the great convenience for taking the mineral
and hot mud bains have certainly made it
famous. *
Another "Will Contest.
Ellen Nyhan yesterday filed a contest to the
probate of the will of her brother, John Mc-
Carthy, who died on Septomber 25, leaving all
his property to ftis brother, Denny McCarthy.
It is alleged by the complainant, on behalf
of herself and relatives, that the testator was
not of sound mitid and was acting under
duress wl en the will was made.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1896.
FATHER MATHEW'S
DAY CELEBRATED
The League of the Cross
Honors the Hero's
Memory.
Metropolitan Hall Crowded With
Sympathizers in the Move
ment
CHIEF OFFICERS INSTALLED.
The Rev. Peter C Yorke Addresses
the Meeting in Place of the
Vicar-General.
The annual celebration of Father
Mathew's day was held last evening in
Metropolitan Hall by the League of the
Cross. It was in every respect a splendid
commemoration of the birth of the great
Irish apostle of temperance. The hall
was beautifully decorated with gilded
draperies and National streamers and
flags which combined with tricolor bunt
ing, and the platform was a mass of Amer
ican flags, leaving an impression of stars
and stripes amid evergreens. Galleries
and the main floor were crowded from the
stage to the doors. The greatest enthu
siasm prevailed throughout the exer
cises.
On the stage were the officers of the
League of the Cross Cadets and members
of the league's executive committee.
Frank Murasky occupied the chair, with
the Rev. Peter C. Yorke on one side and
Thomas H. Fallon, president of the league,
on the other.
Alter a brilliant organ solo by Mi<s
Mari Giorigana.President Fallon called the
meeting to orier. In his introductory ad
dress he made an annual report on the
work of the League of the Cross. Seventy
two mass-meetings had been held during
the year, not including the society's meet
ings and cadet gatherings. The society
has 8000 members and 800 cadets.
Mr. Fallon announcsd that the Very
Rev. J. J. Prendergast, V. G.. was unavoid-
ably absent, and the respected chancellor
of the diocese would address the meeting
instead.
Father Yorke said that owing to the in
disposition of Father Prendergast, to speak
on this occasion and install the officers
was his pleasant duty. He said that the
objects and aims of the League of the Cross
are such as on which all men agree. It is
established to do good to the rising gene
ration of this City â to train the boys to be
good temperate citizens and to give to this
town a race oi men that would need no
new charter to keep them straight. The
speaker was interrupted by wild applause.
"There is behind the figures." he con
tinued, referring to President Fallon's re
port, "a lesson of work and endeavor, and
a story of toil and devotion that are more
eloquent than the words of any speaker.
There is not a week in which gatherings
are not held in which the boys are told of
the evils of intemperance, and instructed
in their duties and urged to keep the
pledge till they reach the age of 21 years."
Father Yorke paid a tribute to the earnest
and tireless work of Father O'Ryan, the
spiritual director of the society, and to
the executive committee.
"You see it in this society, the largest,
the best, the most successful temperance
society in this City or in any city of the
Union.
"It becomes my duty in the absence of
the Most Reverend Archbishop and the
vicar-general to perform the pleasant duty
of installing the executive officers of the
League of the Cross. I hope you will ex
cuse me if I fall into the convention habit
if I say a few words for Mr. Fallon." He
spoke of the president's work and devo
tion and declared that Mr. Fallon was for
years the beginning and the end of the
League of the Cross. "I have it from
Bishop Montgomery, and I can say it my
self, that there would have been no League
of the Cross were it not for Tom Fallon."
Mr. Fallon was installed, and Father
Yorke remarked that the vice-president*
office had been retained by A. B. Muguire,
who, he said, bad be 'n foremost in every
movement looking to the material im
provement of the people of this City, and
his most zealous work was in the cause of
temperance.
The recording secretary, T. R. Curtis,
was spoKen of as untiring In his devotion
to the cause, not alone in his own district,
but in the larger work of the general com
mittee. Father Yorke said ne was glad
to have this opportunity to announce to
the public the uood work they do.
The corresponding secretary, W. A.
Breslm, was introduced as coming from
the district where the league was strong
est, and he was installed with the injunc
tion not to spare Uncle Sara's mails with
notices and correspondence. Dr. 8. J.
Cunningham was installed as treasurer,
in which connection the finances of the
league were considered.
father Yorke added it was a remarka
ble fact that the league was organized and
maintained without a tax on its members.
Bishop Montgomery, he said, was a very
hopeful character, because he believed
that when Catholic people saw the league
grow and numier thousands they would
contribute liberally toward its support
But the one sad thing about the society
was that the people of San Francisco
never thought of contributing or assisting
the society in any material way. In con
clusion he described the aims and objects
of the league â that it is a society which
exacts a pledge from its members till they
have reached the age of 21 years, on the
principle fiat the boy trained to grow up
in the right way will not leave it in after
years.
Father Yorke declared in eloquent lan
guage that the league was a socity in
which every man, Protestant and Catho
lic, could take a deep interest, and this
thought led him into a plea for fellowship,
for harmony of all creeds in the cause of
temperance, charity, doing good. He
said:
"In these days of division, in these days
of controversy, it is good to have one place
where wexan look. What good has been
this religious rancor that has disturbed
the City for the past two years? Would
it not be better, instead of setting brother
against brother on account of creed, to
stand together and to work shoulder to
shoulder doing good? We have held more
than seventy meetings, and in not one of
them can it be said that we have said one
word against any member of any other
church."
When the eloquent address was con
cluded and Father Yorke took bis seat
the audience applauded heartily for a long
time.
The Hon. F. J. Murasky delivered a
eulogy of Father Mathew.
The musical numbers on the programme
were very enjoyable. W. J. Hynes sang
comic songs; Miss A. Roney sang "Let
Me Dream Again" and Matt Grennan
gave a cornet solo. In closing the meet
ing "America was sung by the whole
audience.
DELEGATES APPOINTED.
The Labor Council's Representatives
at the Big Meeting I'o-Murrow.
At its regular meeting last night, the
San Francisco Labor Council received an
invitation fiom the district council of the
Carpenters' Union to send delegates to
participate in a labor convention to be
held at 915J4 Market street to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock. John Hill, W.
Macartnur and C. E. Hawkes were ap
pointed as delegates to the big meeting.
Delegates pricked up their ears a little
when the secretary began reading a com
munication from the National Demo
cratic Committee, and signed by Chair
man James K. Jones. It is dated Chicago,
and callei attention to indorsed resolu
tions adopted by the American Federa-
tion oi Labor indorsing the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of
16 to 1, with the request that many copies
of the resolution also forwarded be dis
tributed among trades and labor councils.
The letter was riled without further ac
tion.
Delegate Macarthur, as a ppecial com
mittee in the matter of the commutation
of the sentence of D. 8. Worden, sentenced
to death for causing the death of Engineer
Clark in the American Railway Union
strike in 1894 in the train wreck at Sacra
mento, reported that he bad been to
Woodland to see Attorney Bush about the
case and about petitions for commutation.
He reported that Worden was under the
influence of liquor before and during his
trial; that his attorneys could get very
little information or assistance from him;
that his alleged accomplices were all ac
quitted; that Worden did not have a fair
trial, and that Governor Budd had con
sented to give an entire day to hearing
further petition for commutation. It was
reported that James H. Barry would at
tend In behalf of the commutation, and
that an effort would be made to get Con
gressman Maguire to go also.
Heavy Damages Asked.
One of the largest patent suits recorded on
the coast for years was yesterday filed in the
United States Circuit Court by Herman Cra
mer of Sonora against the Singer Manufactur
ing Company. Cramer claims that he is the
inventor of an improvement in treadles for
sewing machines and that the same was pat
ented in 1883. Regardless of this, however,
the Singer Company has continued to use his
patent without tne consent of the patentee.
Cramer now seeks an injunction and further
asks that damages to the extent of $250,000
be awarded him.
An Insolvent Furniture Company.
Judge Slack yesterday adjudged the San
Francisco Furniture Company to be insolvent.
Some timt ago the company was forced into
involuntary insolvency, DUt the order was
subsequently modified to the extent of dis
missing the request for the appointment of a
receiver. When the matter came up in court
yesterday, the respondent failed to appear and
in consequence his Honor adjudged the com
pany to oe insolvent.
Father Yorke to Lecture.
Rev. P. C. Yorke, chancellor of the archdio
cese, will lecture in St. Francis Church, Vallejo
street and Montgomery avenue, to-morrow
evening at 8 o'clock. The subject is, -The
End oi the Controversy," and a more oppor
tune one could not be selected. Immediately
preceding the lecture the choir will render
some musical selections. The admission is 50
cents.
Ratification of the Democratic municipal
ticket to-night at Odd fellows' Hall, *
LIBEL NAILED BY
THE GRAND JURY
Campaign Banner Which
Excited the Ire of Police
Judge Low.
The Candidate Is Accused oi
Favoring the Employment
of Chinese.
FOE LIBEL.
J. Miilard Authorized the Lettering
and Display of the Campaign
Device.
The Grand Jury met yesterday after
noon. vVork in the line of appointing
committees was begun, but not finished.
Frederick Hobbs, the foreman, wants to
please all the jurors in the assignments
for committee service and will .probably
gain as much success as his predecessors
achieved in a similar task.
The jury considered a case peculiar in
some of its features and practically de
cided to indict J. Miilard for libel. The
â¢tory is this: Police Judge C. A. Low is a
candidate for re-election to the office which
he now holds. Thursday last he was sud
denly apprised by one of the deputies in
the Sheriff's office that there was a cam
paign wagon out on the street with a ban
ner bearing this alarming legend:
C. F. LOW,
POLICE JUDGB,
FAVOES EMPLOYING CHUfBSX.
BCKATCH HIM.
Authorized by J. Miilard.
The candidate lost no time in finding
tha t wagon. He read the name "C. F.
Low," and while his own initials are "C.
A." he knew by the identification of Low
as Police Judge that the device was de
signed to turn votes against him in the
precincts where the Chinese are despised.
He ascertained at once from P. Gosson.who
owns the wagon, mat G. Gibb, a painter
on Eighth street, near Market, lettered
tue banner. From Gibb he learned that
J. Miilard hired the lettering and also
hired Gosson to exhibit the campaign de
vice.
Judge Low was indignant, but he re
pressed his feelings and taking counsel of
himself read the law of libel. He found
that Police Courts had no jurisdiction in
libel cases and then he presented the mat
ter to Assistant Distiict Attorney Black.
The latter was persuaded that the asser
tion tnat Judge Low favored the employ
ment of Chinese tended to expose the
Judge to hatred and contempt and was
therefore under the law libelous.
The matter was accordinely brought to
the attention of the brand new Grand
Jury. Judge Low was the first witness.
He exhibited the banner. Harry Dur
brow, secretary of the Grand Jury, marked
it "exhibit A," and J. Ross Jackson tacked
it on the wall. G. GiDb identified the
banner as one that he painted for Gosson's
wagon by authority of J. Miilard. Mrs.
Gibb, who was present when Miilard
ordered the lettering, also testified. As a
finishing touch, Miilard himself testified
that he composed the inscription, paid
Gibb for painting it and Gosson for ex
hibiting it to the electors of San Francisco.
Here was proof ample as to the facts.
Then the question arose whether the state
ment that a man employed Chinese was a
libel. Judge Low was sure that he could
prove it was a lie, and on that point the
jury did not hesitate, but in the law there
is a vast difference between a lie and a
libel. The jurjr voted at last, and so next
Friday the indictment of Miilard may be
presented in Judge Slack's court.
The story goes that Miilard, who is a
Chinese interpreter, fancies that Hong-
Dong is getting too much prominence in
the Chinese quarter as an agent of the
Police Court to investigate bonds. Mii
lard endeavored to get the Auditor to stop
the Chinaman's pay, and Mr. Broderlck
asked for light on the subject. Then the
facts came out that Judge Low advised
payment and cited authorities to justify
the Auditor in approving the demands.
It does not appear that Judge Low em
ployed Hong Dong, but nevertheless he
has found the Chinaman useful in the
work of detecting straw bonds.
