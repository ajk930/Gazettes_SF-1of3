And Expressed the Hops That
Reed of Maine Would

Recommendaticin That Will Be of
Great H?lp to the Mining It.
dustry in This State.
â¢ The wort of the convention of the Caii
fornia Miners' Association was finished
yesterday afternoon, the second day of the
session.
The association indorsed the logic of
the civil service system by re-electing all
its officers. They had done their duty
faithfully and well, and the association
thought wisely that it would be better to
retain good servants, familiar with the
work, than to take on green hands.
Governor Buda and Congressman Bar
ham addressed the convention and pave
â¢it words of hope, the Governor announc
ing that the $500,000 appropriated jointly
Ly the State Legislature and Congress
would te expended in ;ho construction of
big dams for restraininc the debris from
hydraulic mines, all the legal technical
difficulties having been cleared away by
the amendment to the act of Congress.
The Governor remarked incidentally that
he would retire to private citizenship after
the expiration of his present term of
olh'ce, and that he did not intend to run
for office again.
Senator White sent a letter apologizing
for not attendms the convention, on the
pround of pressure of business, and inti
mating that Thomas B. Reed of Maine
was opposed to the mining bilf now before
Con cress.
The most pleasant event of the day was j
the presentation to Senator Tirey L. Ford |
of an elegant silver set and china dinner I
service as a testimonial of esteem and of !
_ gratitude for services rendered by him in j
Washington on behalf of the miners of !
this State, and for which services he re- I
tusei to accept any compensation what
ever. .
After Chairman Neff had called the i
meeting to order Judge C. W. Cross of
Nevada, chairman of the committee on '
order of business, presented his report.
The following from the Labor Commis- i
sioner was read :
I have noticed in the columns of the Mining |
and Scientific Press an article suggesting the j
necessity of the passage by our Legislature of i
an amendment to the present mechanics' lien !
law, so that the persons furnishing labor and i
materials in construction, development and '
improvement upon mining properties may be I
adequately protected. I therefore beg leave 10 j
slate that during the last year many com- !
plaints have been filed with me based upon '
the loss of pay by miners who have not been
properly protected, and I sincerely hope thai
.some action may be taken by the Miners' con
vention toward recommending an amendment
of this character to th; legislature.
As the miners' convention represents the
Combined mining interests of our State I feel j
that such a recommendation will meet with I
the hearty approval of the legislators, and re- !
suit In unmeasured benefit to those interested.
Trusting that the convention in its wisdom
â will undertake this action I have the honor to
remain, Yours, very truly,
E. L. Fitzgerald, Labor Commissioner.
Congressman Eugene F. Loud- sent in
the following communication:
In reply to your kind invitation to be pres
ent at a nic-ting of your association on the
11th l ait. I will say that I shall make an effort i
to b2 with you, but if I fail I can assure you
in the future that 1 !>hall endeavor by all hon
orable means to further the interests of ail i
legitimate projects you may advocate, as I I
think 1 have done in the past.
United States Senator Stephen If.
White sent a communication to Secretary
Sonntag, of which the following is a copy :
Your* of the 4th inst. requesting me to be
â¢present at the convention of the California '
Miners' Association which will convene in
ban Francisco November 10 at 10 a. m.. re
ceived.- It would nfford me much pleasure to i
meet you and to Confer with the association
' regarding legislation pending in Congress and
with reference to their interests generally but
1 have been absent from my business so 'long
and must depart for Washington so shortly
that lam forced to stay here for the present. I
The position of the mineral lands bill in the
1 House is very critical, and un.ei-s Mr. Heed
takes a different view of the- situation, I am
afraid we will not be able to get it up. Several
members of the delegation who reside in or
near San Francisco will, no doubt, be at your
convention and can explain if necessary" the
situation fully, although i believe that you are
thoroughly advised with reference, theicto.
Senator Ford is cognizant â â  of the facts and
will be able to adequately explain the diffi
culties surrounding us. 1 have only to add
that I will continue my bust exertions to
wards advancing what I deem to be your rea
sonable demands. Yours very truly,
Stephen M. White. -

Judge C. W. Crow 'â¢ said ; the â â  opinion of
the Attorney-General read yesterday need j
cause no alarm among n^inera.; He had j
caiefuiiy studied the \ opinion and found ]
that it merely went to declare that the
Debris Com missioner had no power to make
contracts jointly, with the United States
â¢ Commission, j but ho had full a power fto
â¢ contract and pay for the'* construction- of
work performed by the \ State. The intent
of the law was 7 to prevent the United
States from being entangled in the matter
in any way.' â ' : V â "'" "

â¢both miners -and. farmers,- had implicit
' confidence in the work "of the United

excellent service they had rendered tbe
miners of tins State on that occasion.
Wl C. Ralston of the committee on

or non-mineral cnaracter, we have had no dv-
ties to perform whatsoever, therefore have no
report of progress.
Ira Hill Reed of Calaveras offered the
following:. â¢ .' > ÂÂ» ; â¢'â  ... . , .... :
Whereas, -Transportation fecilitles are of
paramount importance /or the success of all
mining ente.-piises; and whereas, the present
road system 01 this state is entireiy.uasuiisfdc

Resolved, Tnat this convention heartily in
dorses tno movement for good roads as evi
denced by the creation of the Slate- Roads
Commission, and we ask for immediate legis

ways.
The most pleasant feature of the day's
.session was observed shortly before tho
noon , recess. It was the presentation to
Tirey L. Ford of an elegant and valuable
silver service and a dinner set o: fine
china. The presentation was in the nature
of a surprise.
..Chairman >ieff, during a lull in the pro
ceedings, called Mr. Ford to the platform,
and when tnat gentleman arrived there to
relieve the chair, as he thought, Mr.,Neff
addressed him as follows: j
\ "Mr. fiord,, yesterday, by a : unani
mous vote of this convention, you were
given an ovation of which any man might
be proud. You have faithfully, honestly
and conscientiously discharged every duty
which has been imposed upon you by this
organization. . The action of yesterday
speaks louder than amy language that I
could use on this occasion. It came spon
taneously from every, gentleman on the
floor. ."..'... - i â  â - â  â  â 
"There is no one that has realized what
you have done better : than the members
of the executive committee and myself.
Recognizing the great services which you
have rendered us, I am proud to be the
happy medium through which this testi
monial will be presented."
Mr. Ford was greeted with an outburst
of applause and replied with much feeling.
"Mr. President.. , and Gentlemen. I
would' be neither honest nor sincere if I
attempted to conceal the pleasure which
this manifestation of your confidence
affords, me. It comes 10 me at a time
when it adds something of embarrassment
on this occasion, and if you will believe
me, when I express to you the fact that I
am illy prepared to ; prpDerly .extend to
you my appreciative thanks for this kind
ness upon your part. " ' I appreciate the
further fact that the miners of California
here' are apt to be over-enthusiastic and
extraordinarily generous in the treatment
of their friends. ;-â¢-,'â¢;. Â«.:? --:;;.;â .
"On this occasion, having found mo ,a
humble instrumentality.for the conveying
of certain action 1 and direction* from the
good people of this State to our delegation'
at Washington, you hav<? probably mis
taken the value =of my effort?, 1 - and have
bestowed your gratitude upon one when
it should have been bestowed upon an
other. I claim no particular praise for
what I have been -able to accomplish for
the mining interest. 'â¢ >
"This association has set on foot these
measures for prosperity and has laid the
foundations well and deep. Ymit work
was well done and your j executive com
mitlee has been composed of brave ; men,
and at the head of that committee has
been that grandest Roman of them all,
Jacob Neff of Placer, without whose pres
ence and guiding influence there is but
little doubt we would not have reached
the high position which we hold to-day;
and surrounding him are men who have
devoted their time without reward other
than the esteem of their fellow-men
_"I found when I went to Washington
that, others had preceded me and had
paved the way for further legislation.
They were our loyal friends, Judge Niles
Eearls/: Major Frank â  McLaughlin and
Mr. Hobson: of Placer, with other good
friends of ours,; among whom was the late
Hon. J. K. Luttrcll. ; , v
"i'found that those distinguished gen
tlemen had hud the foundation and had
begun with educating a large part' of the
Eastern people to Jook upon us with some
lavor.' *I merely. presented jour wishes as
to the needed legislation. 1 at Washington
and' gave snch "arguments as had been
placed in my possession..;.^
- "I want to say much, but it may be best
for me to permit you to understand that
from the very depth of my heart, from my
innermost' soul, I thank those â  generous
miners for the confidence which r they seem
to have exhibited toward me. I could not
make :it.^ stronger; : Is could not find i the
words to fittingly, portray, to you the emo
tions that permeate me this .morning.
Noticing the peculiar wording of the in
scriptions upon this beautiful â  silverware
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 12, 1896.
which you have seen fit to give to me I de- t
sire to say in behalf of that absent part- â¢
ncr of my life's sorrows and joys that were j
! she with me this morning she would with
| me return you her cordial thanks.' For, I i
1 believe I may Bay without departure from
' the truth, that she does take some little,
| interest in her husband's welfare. In her
j behalf I thank you also.
"In conclusion, 1 will say that whatever
j I may be able to do for the causa which,
you are assembled hera to speed, â¢what
ever of devotion and ability may be or ser- i
i vice to you, you have â  but to command, I
! and it is yours.'.' '
The convention rose to its feet and gave j
I Mr. Ford three cheers. "

pointed Robert McMurray and Tirey L.

The Governor was greeted with enthusi- I
asm and when silence was restored spoke
as follows:?. '..
. ''Mr. President and members of the !
convention : . I aid not expect to have the .
pleasures of appearing before you to-day. I
Though earnestly invited by your presi- !
. dent and other members of the organiza- |
tion I doubt whether I could have taken
the time but for the fact that Debri9 i
Commissioner Kidder a short time ago i
submitted to mÂ« an opinion of the Attpr- I
ney-General of California in regard to his j
duties as such commissioner. - I informed
I Mr. Kidder that he was mistaken as to
! the purport of Â«he opinion of, the Attor
j ney-General. Tne $250,000 that was ap
-1 propriated by the Legislature of 1893 is in
| the State treasury to-day and will he ex-
I pended with the $250,000 appropriated by
; Congress at its last session; Â
: "The Debris Commissioner's duties are \
I to supervise and approve the planz of the |
1 United States engineers, and thereafter to |
j see that the contracts lor the construction
] of restraining dams are properly, carried
out. He then reports the matter before
â¢he Board of Examiners, and they go to
the Controller and are paid by order on
the State Treasurer. -r*
."In my judgment there can be no
question a3 to the effect of the law upon
our statute-book?. There Can be no ques
tion as to its expenditure, and if '.here
should be, it is. very .ertsy for; the next
Legislature to , make ; the . bill say exactly
what the miners â¢ want it }to say. .1, am
pleased, after all these years, to see accom
pl;shed that which has been attempted; ,'
â¢ "As a member of Congress I remember
inheriting a bill: from my predecessor r ap:
-: propriating. $500,000 for the very purpose
jof the joint Jappropriation to-day ; by Con
i gress and , tne Legislature of this State.

and water at Washington with a special !
secret
G. M. M. Ross suggested that at the I
earliest moment arrangement* be made ;
go that the University of California can i
issue to non-resident students the degree
of mining engineer. The university could
announce the subjects : in . which \ the
students would be examined and suggest
the best textbooks for study, and in all
possible ways aid the non-resident students
to prepare themselves for such examina
tions as they would have to pass before
the degree would be conferred.
The mining bureau could be made part
ef a school of mines to be located in San '

Address by W. H. Ricketts.
At a meeting of the committee on reso
lutions in the Palace Hotel last Tuesday
night A. H. Ricketts mado an able ad
dress on the mining laws. He said in
part:
Mr. President: The proposed legislation
which has been presented to this convention
for appropriate action by the Mining and
Scientific Press of this City compriseii six bills
and one proposed amendment to the State
constitution. These bills relate to the follow
ing subjects :
1. An act relating to the location, reloca
tion, manner of recording lode and placer
claims, mill sites, tunnel rights, amount of
work necessary to hold possession of mining
claims and the rights of co-owners thereon.
2. An act relating to removing, defacing or
altering landmarks, and amending section
605, Penal Code.
3. An act relating to the robbery of mines
and reduction works, and amending the act of
1850.
4. An act relating to the purchase of ores.
5. An act relating to liens of mechanics and
others upon real property, and amending sec
tion 1183. C. C. P.
6. A constitutional amendment defining
what shall be construed as public uses, and
amending section 14 of article I of the consti
tution.
7. An act relating to and defining placer
claims, and amending section 2329 of the
United States Revised Statutes.
California has paid less legislative attention
to the wants of the miner than any mining
Slate or Territory, although the Federal min
ing law contemplates that its provisions shall
oe supplemented by State and Territorial legis
lation, as well as by the local rules of miners.
All the mining States, except California and
Nevada, and all the mining Territories have
long since enacted general laws relating to the
manner of locating and worKing mining
cliims.
A general mining law of a State is always
more accessible than district laws, is univer
sal in its operation and operative until re
pealed, and so serves to give greater stability
to the title of unpatented mining claims.
It is pernaps safe to say that fully one-half
of all the recorded notices of location in this
State would be held to be inadmissible as evi
dence of any fact under the rulings of the
courts, either because the local law has fallen
into disuse or because the notices affect claims
lying'wlthin no organized mining district.
A State law will correct this evil and make a
recorded notice prima facie evidence of the
facts therein contained.
Tne first bill, in numerical order, presented
for your consideration provides for the post
ing, recording the location nonce, the con
tents thereof and the Ume within which
those acts shall be performed, to wit: ninety
days from discovery. This gives the locator
time in which to perfect his location.
This bill further provides how abandoned
claims may be relocated, and how amended
locations may be made.
This provision enables the mineowner to
have his surface lines determined, obviates
the danger of the shifting of monuments or
the subsqueut overlat.ping of his claim by
adjoining mine owners or junior locators.
The bill further provides for the "advertis
ing out" of delinquent co-owners and the
effect as evidence of the record of such pro
ceedings.
The second bill, in numerical order, is a pro
posed amendment of Section 605 of the Penal
Code, making it a misdemeanor to maliciously
remove, deface or alter landmarks; pariicu
larly.the location stakes or monuments of a
mining claim.
The third bill is a proposed amendment of
J^gflCE FIVE CENTS.
section 1 of the act of 1850, amended in 1372,
relating to the s-tenling of ores, gold dust,
amalgam, quicksilver or concentrates.
Both of the f,vo bills last mentioned amplify
the existing laws upbn the several subjects,
broaden their scope aud are intended to give
additional protection to the mining Industry
in this State.
The same remarks are applicable to the
fourth bill, which is entitled "An act relating
to the purchase of ores," and is intended to
repress an evil which exists to a greater or
less extent In every mining camp. This bill
provides a means for the identification of ores
sold, and the ascertainment oi the name of the
person who delivered the same or received the
fircceedis thereof. A similar statute prevails
n Colorado.
The nith bill is a proposed amendment of
section 1183 of the Co<le of Civil Procedure
relating to liens oi mechanics atid others upon
real property, tina is intended to secure to the
laboring miner a greater risht than is af
forded by the existing provisions of the law
upon that subject. The most cursory read
iug of tho present law will show its inn mi old
deficiencies Â«s to the miner's right of lien and
the necessity for its enlargement. The Su
preme Court's construction of this law has
tended to emphasize its inherent defects, and
the proposed amendment has been drawn in
the light ot its decisions.
Tho proposed amendment to section 14 ot
article I ot the constitution defines what shall
be construed as public uses and is taken
bodily from the act of 1895. In view of tha
publication in the Mining and .Scientific
Press of the 7th of the editorial headed "Emi
nent Domain in Mininp," copies of which aro
before you, it would seem litce a worn of
supererogation forme to say anything further
as to the reason why this constitutional
amendment appears to be a proper measure.
A proposed amendment oi section 2320 of
the United States Revised Statutes v sub
mitted ior your consideration. It simply de
liuess as "placer" what the Land Department
has held to be "placer" for about fifteen yeura
before the Aldritt decision.
It is not assumed that these various matters
are lree from error, althougn great Cure haj
been taken in their preparation.
Since the publication of these bills several
very important amendments have been made
thereto at the suggestion of the Alameda del
egation and by Professor W. S. Keyes, vice
president of the Mining Bureau, and it
is hoped that this convention will likewise add
to the efficiency of this proposed legislation.
I now, on tehalf of the mining industry of
Caliiornia, submit the matter for your consid
eration.
Placer County Miners.
At a meeting of the Placer County
Miners' Association held at the Palace
Hotel yesterday morning the following
named officers were elected for the ensuing
term: Harold T. Power, president; M. T.
Lawrence, vice-uresident ; Ivan H. Parker,
secretary, and T. J. Nicholt, treasurer. â 
TO RUN TO THE BAY
A Flan to Have Folk Street Open to
. . the Water.
A meeting of the Polk-street Improve
ment Club was held Tuesday evening at
IGOS Polk street. ;b: ;' . '
Secretary Dross in presenting his report
announced that the Sutter-street Railroad
Company, through its secretary, haa con
tributed $30 toward the electric-light fund.
He announced that tho membership is
now 193.
The executive committee, through Mr.
Bibo, reported a suggestion tbat immedi
ate action be taken in the matter of the
extension of Polk street north.
Yal Schmidt stated, that the Van Ncsa
Improvement Club is anxious to assist in
the opening of the block that now shuts
off direct travel.
A proposition to amend the by-laws so
as to more fully set forth the object
of the club, which is now given aa
"the improvement of Polk street," was
laid over until the next meeting. The
amendment is that the object is "the im
provement of Polk street, the promotion
of business and the protection of the
members of tbe club."
The president announced that a special
meeting will be held next Monday even
ing for the purpose of devising means to
open the street north of Lombard, and all
property-owners and the members of the
Van Ness Aveuue'club will be invited to
attend.
A member of the club called attention
to the fact that a number of merchants on
Sixth street are paying but $1 50 a week
for lights, while tbe Polk-street Club is
charged $3 per light. After some discus
sion, during which it was stated that the
opposition company which furnishes
lights at reduced rntes could not have fur
nished the lights for the reason that it
has no franchise, it was stated that
the club has signea a contract for six
months and that it hopes to have tho City
assume the lights before that time.
Finally a committee of three, consisting
of Messrs. Levin, Schmidt and Frankle,
were appointed to obtain information oa
the subject.
THE TROPHY GOES SOUTH
The State Championship Is Relinquished
by the Olympic Gun Club.
The Olympic Gun Club held its annual
meeting in its new home at 1309 Van Ness
avenue last evening.
The election of officers to serve during
the ensuing year resulted as follows:
President, Harlow H. White; secretary,
Merton C. Allen; captain, L. D. Owens.
In addition to the gentlemen named
the board of directors consists of Alfred
A. Borlini, A. H. Whitney, Stanley G.
Scovern, F. W. Eaton, Fred R. Webster
and Edward Jttosqui. The club has now a
membership of 112.
In executive meeting the board of di
rectors took up the matter of the State
championship. It will be remembered
that on October 5. at a State shoot held at
San Jose, the Los Angeles Gun Club tied
tbe Olympic Gun Club according to tho
decision of the State Association. The
southerners refused to accept the decision,
claiming that the referee had allowed an
extra bird to one of their team who had
been balked. That extra bird, therefore,
made them a winner.
Such being the case they refused to
shoot the tit* off and the Oiympics took
the championship by default.
Los An. eles has protested against this,
and the protest was recognizea last night
by the Oiympics. who decided to return
the trophy and buttons to tbe State Asso
ciation that they may be forwarded to the
Los Angeles Gun Club.
A Smuggler Dying.
Several months ago Thomas McGowan, a
fireman on one of the steamers that ply be
tween this port and British Columbia, was ar
rested at Benicla while trying to smuggle
opium ashore. He was sentenced to serve
one year's imprisonment in the Alameda
County Jail. Yesterday District Attorney
Foote learned that McGowan was likely to die
from typhoid pneumonia, nnd he asked Judge
Morrow for permission to have the man re
moved to some hospital. Judge Morrow or
dered McGowan's iemoval to the Receiving
Hospital of Oakland.

SENATOR THORSTON TALKS.
Will Aot Leave HiÂ« Sent in the Senate
for a Cabinet Portfolio.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 11. âSenator
John M. Thnrston of Nebraska was a
guest of the Union League Club last night.
Incidentally he corrected the impression
ihst he hesitated on the choice of a
Cabinet position and his seat in the
Senate. Mr. Thurston said:
"When I m:ide the contest for the
McKinley committee I publicly an
nounced to the people of Nebraska that
I would not accept any position, and
wouid retain my seat in the Senate,"
said Thurston. "Up to this time I have
stuck to that promise, and to break it
now would be impossible if I were so dis
posed. Nebraska has a Populist Legisla
ture, and to leave my seat in the Senate
vacant would be an invitation to the
silver men to make fe most of it and
seat Wiiiiam J. Bryan, with the purpose
of overcoming the Republican majority
in the Senate. No, Republicans in the
Senate are needed too badly this year for
me to help the Democrats steal a march."
Continuing, the Senator said that tbe
mention of bis name in connection with
a place in the new Cabinet is unwarranted,'
but he did not disguise the fact that
under other circumstances he would be
glad to accept a place in McKinley's
official family.

MISTAKES FOR A LYNOBER
Lively Chase of a Sheriff After a Xegro
Prisoner.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 11.â A Sun
special from Columbia, S. C, says: Yes
terday morning at daybreak the deputies
of Magistrate Cochran brought in Dan
Allen, a negro charged with the assassi
nation of Thomas C. Perry and be was
sent to jail for safe keeping.
The Magistrate in his written order said
he wished to have a preliminary investi
gation. The Sheriff had misgivings and
was ready to act. when a short time after
ward word was brought that 300 men had
the prisoner and were going to lynch
him.
With a spirited horse attached to a buggy
the Sheriff gave chase. After covering
twelve miles he came upon the party.
The prisoner was being held in a bng^y-
The Sheriff hailed the party and in the
name of South Carolina demanded the
surrender of the prisoner.
The driver answered: "What hove you
to do with it?" Then the driver lashed his
horse into a run. The Sheriff's horse was
a thoroughbred, not a trotter; so he cut
him out of the harness, rode him bareback,
and followed the supposed lynchers.
Overhauling tbem ho again demanded
the prisoner. They did not heed him, so
lie drew his pistol ami began to fire on
the crowd. The Sheriff's horse was "gun
shy" and this interfered with his aim.
The horse then threw him in the road.
On capturing his horse the Sheriff con
tinued the chase.
Coming to tbe forks of the road, he took
the one leading to the Savannah River
instead of the one going to Magistrate
Cochran's house. Pursuing this for four
miles he found himself off the track. Re
tracing his steps, Nance reached Cochriin's
house and found the prisoner safe and
sound. The men the Sheriff had pursued
were Cochran's deputies and a cuard. They
mistook the Sheriff for the leader o( the
lyucbersand would have killed him had
he come in close raoge.
THE MAKING OF FUEL
An American Industry That
Failed in the Eastern
States.
S. H. Tacy of This City Saw|tln First
Compressed Anthracite Coal
Made and Helped.
S. H. Tacy. manager of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, is
watching with peculiar intsrest the at
tempt which is being made to introduce
Chinese fuel into this market. One rea
son for this is the fact that twenty years
ago Mr. Tacy was connected with the
manufacture of the lirst lot of compressed
fuel of the sort now coming in irom China
ever made.
Mr. Tacy wa3 then quite young. He be
came acquainted with Professor E. F.
Loiseau, a Frenchman who had made a
machine to utilize the waste coai, the pul
vtrized dust of anthracite coal mines, and
who was about to make experiments at
Maboning, Pu.
Professor Loiseau was an enthusiastic
man as wull as a scientist. He believed
that his invention would be of great bene
fit to mankind, utilizing that which had
before been considered practically value
less ana giving fuel lor homes at a nomi
nal cost. He planned to faupply families
with nrst-class fuel at the rate of" $2 25 per
ton.
The anthracite dust was. of course,
equa'ly inflammable with other coal under
favorable conditions. He had only two
problems, the making of the compressed
substance into such shapes that it would
burn freely and the combination of it with
such other substance as would not cost
much and not interfere with the quality of
heat to be released by combustion.
He hud a machine which consisted in
part of two revolving cylinders with con
cave surfaces. Between these two he
forced the fuel plaster composed of an
thracite coal dust and 5 per cent of clay,
the mixture being moistened by milk of
lime to give the necessary coherence.
After passing between the cylinders the
material came out shaped like the coal
balls which are now coming into San Fran
cisco for sale from Tonqnin. They fell
upon a wire irame work which moved,
carrying the coal balls into a ciryinc-room
where tbey were dipped in silicate of soda.
W r hen they were dry they were ready to be
used 'or fuel.
Professor Loiseau found capitalists who
believed that he had discovered something
of commercial value. A stock com pan y
was organized in Puiiadeiphia. The price
of the fuel was placed at $2 25 per ton.
The company expended Ã¼bout $200,000
and then gave the enterprise up, not being
able to successfully compete with the
cheap anthracite coal in lumps. Prolessor
Loiseau died some years ago, having ex
pended many years in making his experi
ments in fuel. He had patented his in
vention in all the countries of Europe and
in the United States.
When Mr. Tacy first saw the coal from
Totiquin his attention was immediately
arrested thereby. It looked just like the
fuel which had been first compressed in
his presence and with his assistance. In
fact Mr. Tacy received the fir3t coal ball
produced and he kept it as a souvenir for
some time, it haying been given to him
for that purpose in acknowledgment of hit
services.
Before Professor Loiseau abandoned his
experiment he made an exhibition of his
fuel at the Centennial Exposition at Phila
delphia in 1876, in an iron building con
structed for that purpose. There* the fuel
burned freely and handsomely, looking
like fiery eggs in the grate. The ciay
made the ash heavy, so that there was no
dust. Professor Loiseau tried to introduce
the fuel in Belgium and be met with an
exciting adventure. The coal miners
threatened him, and he buried his fuel
machine to stye it from being destroyed.
Mr. Tacy believes that the fuel coming
in from Tonquin was made by one of Pro
fessor Loiseau's machines. It is made by
a French company. The American bark
Colorado brought the first cargo to this
port. Another cargo is on the way.
Paper I) ,iv.
The paper doll seems an insigniricant
article of trade, but its designing is a not
altogether unimportant branch of art.
One of the firms which is responsible for

years before she had delighted her own

LABOR'S KNIGHTS
IN GRAND COUNCIL
Sovereign's Annual Address
Touches on the Late
Election.
Rejoices That the Order Solidly
Opposed Concentrated
Wealth.
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE.
Says Knights Should Fight the Money
Power to an Everlasting
Finish.
ROCHESTER, N. V.. Nov. 11.â Thl*
morning's session of the General Assem
bly of the Knights of Labor opened at 10
o'clock. The assembly will last a week
longer; officers to be elected later. Sov
ereign will undoubtedly be re-elected.
Upon taking the chair this morning Sov
ereign delivered his annual address.
Grand Master Workman Sovereign in
his address to the General Assembly to
day said that the Knights were the only
body which in the late contest had solidly
opposed aggregate wealth. The Federn- |
tion of Labor, he said, had been loose and
had fallen a prey to Wall street. He
stated that the Knights should now seek
to unite all industtial reform forces. He
said :
We should center our immediate demands
upon an equitable income tax. the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at the present
ratio, payment of all Goveruincnt bonds ac
cording to present contract and the Govern
ment issue of all the money of the country.
We 9hould make positive and unequivocal
declarations against the Government by in
junction to prevent the Increase of the stand
ing army, the payment of the bonded debt in
gold alone, the issue oi bonds in time of
tieKce and the issue of circulating notes by
banking corporations. We should prepare an
entire new secret organization with stronger
obligation<i, establish a degree known as
minute men, return to the former system of
working in absolute secrecy.
We should then appeal to the free silver and
reform fore- p ana enter into the great broad
field of agitation to fight the money power
and corporations to an everlasting linish.
The report of the general secretary
treasurer was then read. A synopsis of
the report follows:
Since we met together one year ago, your
general officers have had to contend against j
attacks of a most villainous character by r.-a- !
Ron of the just stand taken by them in rcfus- I
ing to allow a small clique of men, who are
familiarly known as the "New York Triangle" i
of the hocialigtic Labor party, to get control of j
tne machinery of the Knights of Labor for j
the dissemination of their doctrines, which I i
believed inimical and a! variance with the
platform and principles of this order.
Among those who assisted this "combina- ,
tion" in their work of v. tempted destruction
wt! find some of the best and trurst friends of
our order; men who were induced to believe
t!:nt the movement started by the triangle was i
parey and so'ely in the interests of the '
Knights of Labor, but n-ho learned, whan j
nearly too late, that the deep-luid plot was lor >
the purpose of enabling Daniel C. Laon, I
Lucien S&nial and Ernest Bohm to control the 'â 
order in every department. The last name*!, i
failing in their efforts, have used the public !
press and platform to denounce the officers I
a n 1 the order, wi'.h the hope mat thoy would '
desirov the bame and upon its ruins build up !
an institution with the name gf the Knights !
of Labor as their guiding star. The men be- i
hind it were unscrupulous, men who would :
stop at nothing to accomplish the object they i
had in view.
During the present campaign we have j
printed for the National Silver Committee .
25t),000 docum.nt-, for which we received ;

1 call attention to this subject on account of ;
the newspaper abuse and vilification that i
your general officers are subject to. emanating j
from within and outside of the order.
The report makes 3 savage attack upon '
the Washington Daily Times. Of the
window-glass workers of the United Slates
it says:
The window-glass manufacturers have built
up an enormous monopoly nt the expense of
the American people. Notwithstanding this '
fact, which is alleged to help the American |
workman, the increase oi labor employed is
not American. I would request that the ex
ecutive board be instructed to urge that in
siead of a prohibitory turifl" on giKss the tariff!
be transferred to the immigrant glass-workers |
so that the industry shall be retained in the
control of native workmen, and the foreign
workman kept where he belongs.

year of $33,714 73 from all sources; bal
ance on hand July 1, 1805, $6404 99; total
$40,119 72.
After the reading of Secretary-Treasurer
Hayes' report J. If. Bishop read the re
port of tne general worthy foreman, after
which the assembly adjourned until after
noon.
The afternoon session, which was also
secret, lasted until 4 p. m. The financial
committee stated that the report as sub
mitted by the secretary- treasurer was cor
rect.
The following delegates were apDointed
as a committee on secret work and will
make changes and reconstruct the
ritualistic work of the order: James M.

COLLAPSE OF A SECOND FLOOR.
Miraculous Escape From Death or Injury
of Many Persons in a Big New
York Building.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 11.â The sec
ond floor of the building occupied by the
Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company,
35 and 37 Vesey street, suddenly coilapsed
about 8 o'clock tnis morning. The floor
which collapsed and the floor directly
under it are used as the headquarters of
the tea company, whose large retail-es
tablishment is in sn adjoining building.
The thiid floor was occupied by the print
ing firm of Henry I. Cain Â«ft S.on. The
firm of Benekett & Bradford, general
printers and bookbinders, have t he two
top floors. They employ a number of
girls. The printers in Cain ArSon's estab
lishment bad just started their presses at
a few minutes of 8 o'clock, when there
was a long rumbling noise and then a
quick crash which made the building
tthake for a few minutes. The printers
did not wait long to find out what was the
matter.
The cause of the collnpse of the floor
was that it was overweighted. Luckily no
one was in the shipping-room on the
ground floor at the time of the collapse or
loss of life would certainly have occurred.
The building had been recently braced In
order to strengthen it.

WANTED TO RIDE ASTRIDE
Sensation Created by an Actress
at New York's Horse
I 3 â¢ .Show.; x
Despite Appeals 0 ficia s Decided the
Innovaticn Could Not Be
Tolerated.
NEW YORK., N. V., Not. 11.-A
drizzling rain had somewhat of a deter
ring effect upon the attendance at the
horse to-day, but the rain stopued
before the evening session at ,8 o'clock.
The third day always appears to be a
favorite with horse show goers, and to
day was no exception.- The boxes and re
served seats presented a solid vista of
black and white, relieved from its severe
ness by the brilliant and ever-variegated
costumes of the ladies, while on the floor
the stream of humanity revolved in a
never-ending whirl of kaleidoscon.c color.
The feature this afternoon was the par
ade of tue "white-winged angels" who
keep the streets of the metropolis free
irom dirt and accompanying microbes.
Nine immaculate-looking servitors of the
Department of Street-cleaning entered the
ring with the sang froid of veteran coach
men, and as many Norman horses fol
lowed, attached to spotlessly clean aud
â pick and span cars, which looked as if a
particle of oust would be desecration.
The display was a credit to the depart
ment, and Colonel Waring, who was in
the ring with the judges, appeared to be
very much delighted when the crowd
cheered his troops.
Haciineys, trotters and pomes a 1301 30 had
their iuning in tne aiternoon, while tue
display of four-in-hand teams was partic
ularly tine.
Anotner incident new to the exhibition
association occurred in the evening.
After the paraiie of prize winners, ihe
hign school horses of class II came into
the ring for judgment. A female member
of a troop of well-known music hall ar
tists now performing in this city had en
tered a white stallion. Maestoso, and the
entry list being open to all, the entry was
received. To-niKnt the lady appeared to
mount and ride in the riiit;, when it was
discovered that the horse was equipped
with a saddle only used by the sterner
sex. Further investigation showed that
the iady was picturesquely attired in a
long, drab paddock coat, which only par
tially disguised a pair of top boots sur
mounted by pink fleshinirs. This proved
a little too strong for the management
and she was notified that she could not
appear in the ring in that attire. She ex
postulated, but the officials wereobdnrate,
and a tine advertising scheme was nipped
in the bud.
Harry Fairfax's stallion, Chesterfield, a
stocky-built ruan of fine action, won two
blue ribbons. He first appeared in the
class for pony stallions up to 14 hands 1
inch and, being just within the limit, won
first. He was then shown in the class lor
hackney stallions, from 14 lo 15 hands, and
won again. Prizes were awarded as fol

ROBBERY DARING
AND SENSATIONAL
Five Masked Men* Subdue
a Cleveland Night
Watchman.
Blow Open the Star Brewing
Company's Safe and Secure
About $6500.
EECAPE AND LEAVE NO CLEW.
The Crime Committed in the Early
Morning in a Densely Popu
lated Section.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 11â The
most sensational and successful robbery
that has occurred in this city lor years
was perpetrated at the works of the Star
Brewing Company early this morning.
Night Watchman Louis Christiansen was
making his routine inspection of the build
ing, when five masked men spring out of
the darkness. A fierce struggle ensued.
The robbers were heavily armed, but re
frained from using their guns in order to
avoid nois.'. The watchman was finally
overcome, bound and gagged and tied to a
steampipe. The robbers then broke open
the office door and wrapped the safe with
wet blankets. The combination handle
was broken off and the safe blown to
pieces with dynamite. After looting the
safe of its contents and taking everything
of value in the office the robbers departed.
The helpless watchman managed to
free himself after repeated struggles and
pave the alarm. Officers quietly arrived
and an investigation was made. The roo
bers left no clew DeLind them, but it is
the opinion of the police that the crime
was the work of professional safe- blowers.
The robbers secured $5000 in money and
carried away a collection of rare coins be
longing to C. A. Strangeman, valued at
$1500. The robbery occurred in a densely
populated, wealthy residence part of the
city. Watchman Christiansen sustained
three severe wounds as the result of his
struggle with the men.
KINDLY ACIS REQUITED
Bread Catt Upon. tne. Waters by Ex-
Governor Foster of Ohio.
CHICAGO. 111., Nov. 11.â A special
from Fostoria, Ohio, says: During the
years o. his prosperity Charles Foster was
known far and wide for his liberality and
kindness for others less fortunate thau
himself. H-? was always the first to sub
scribe to any enterprise which promised
to be of benefit to the community and was
known as a man who never, under any
circumstances, foreclosed v mortgage.
Many years ago when his father built
the house now occupied by Foster's
mother, the contractor was a man named
Johnson, who in some way became in
volved so that his home was to be sold
by the Sheriff. Learning of the man's
trouble Foster advanced the money to
release the mortgage with little if any
hope of ever getting any return. After a
time Johnson went WWestW T est and passed out
of the minds of his iriends here and has
since died.
Before his death, however, he told his
sons how Foster had befriend- d him and
how gratelul he felt for the great service.
The sons prospered and Foster failed.
They invested a large amount, $60,000 it
is said, in smelting works between Denver
and Cripple Creek in Foster's name, but
said nothing to him until the success of
the project was fully assured.
f| Foster has been mude a director in the
Concern and has gone to Denver to at
tend a meeting of the directors. It is said
that the works are paying immense divi
dends.

haa occupied were four gallons of nitro,

CHICAGO, 11..., Nov. ILâ ln his will,
which was admitted to probate in March,

BERLINER PATENT SUIT
Arguments Concluded Before the
United States Supreme
Court.
The Decision of Vast Importance to
the Government and the Bell
Telephon? Company.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 11.-Ferdi
nand Fish, counsel for the Bell Telephone
Company, finished his argument in the
Supreme Court to-day in opposition to the
demand of the Government that the pa
tent lor the Berliner transmitter for tele
phones, issued in 1891, be canceled for
fraud in the illegal delay in its issue from
the Patent Office.
He was followed by Joseph H. Choate of
New York, also for the telephone com
pany, who said it was the first time and
probably would be the last that the court
had been asked to annul a grant, not for
any iault of the grantee, but because of
alleged wrongful and illegal acts of the
grantor by its agents.
Mr. Choate recalled to the court some
established principles of law as specially
applicable to suits to annul patents. One
of these was that the Government occu
pied no better position to do this than any
other grantor, but must invoke and be
coverned by the same rules of equity.
The only distinction, he said, was to the |
advantage of the Government, because of
the greater solemnity and dignity of the
prant under the seal of the United States
and the immen-e importance and neces
sity of the stability of Government title?.
No authority could be found, he claimed,
for the proposition, because the Commis
sioner took too Jong a time to decide
whether or not a patent should be issued
or erred in the proceedings by which he
reached a conclusion that the patent was
thereby impaired.
To the claim that the Berliner patent
was invalid because a patent had been
previously granted to the same applicant
for a similar invention, Mr. Choate an
swered that a court of eauity could not
entertain a bill to annul the patent for
that reason.
C. Austin B-owne of Boston, special
assistant Attorney-General, concluded the
argument in support of the Government's
bill. He contended that there was some
thing to be considered beyond the mere
technical right of the company to a patent
and the duty of the Commissioner to issue I
it â the Commissioner's duty was to issue
only such patents as did not conflict with
the rights of the public.
With the conclusion of Mr. Browne's
argument the case went to the court for
consideration.

creased during the past year. This can in
part be accounted for by the large increase
in "rai?ed" or "altered" notes found in
circulation, some of which are most skill
fully executed. He attributes the facility
with which the public are deceived by
raised notes to the irequent changes in
the desiens of United Suites notes, which
makes it almost impossible fcr the public
to become familiar with the currency. It
is also made plain, he adds, that the dis
tinctive paper iv use is an aid to tbe
criminal rather than a protection to the
public, because of the fact that a
note printed upon t>aper containing
silk threads (as a number of the best of
the counterfeits and all ol the raised notes
are) is accepted in a majority of instances
without hesitation, owing to the erroneous
impression that the paper used by the
Government is manufactured by a secret
process and cannot be counterfeited. He
has also become convinced that the intro
duction of silk in:o the paper tends to les
sen its wearing qualities and is therefore
responsible to a degree for its short life.
The counterfeiting ol gold and silver
coins has been on the increase in all parts
of the country. Some counterfeits of sil
ver coins have appeared on the Pacific
Coast that are quite as jrood as the gen
uine, both in weight and fineness, and are
made from dies of excellent workmanship.

LONDON, Eng., Nov. 11. â A news

the Pope has decided to remove Arch
bishop Ireland from the diocese of St.

qualified to know that Archbishop Ire
land has lost the major part of the former
consideration in which he was heid at the
Vatican, and that the course he pursued

OF DEMOCRACY
His Letter of Acceptance
at Last Given to the
Public.
Its Wording Ample Reason for
Its Suppression by the
Managers.
FLAYS SEWALL AND HIS PARTY
Chairman Marion Butler Accused of
Playing Traitor to the
Populists.
ATLANTA, Ga., Nov. 11.â Thomas E. I
â¢ "Watson's letter accepting the Vice-Presi
dential nomination of the People's party
has at last been made public. It was
written on October 14 last to Senator But
ler, chairman ot the notification commit
tee and manager of the Populist campaign.
It was suppressed by Senator Butler dur- j
ing the campaign for reasons that are
obvious from a perusal of its contents.
The document would make seven columns
in a newspaper. Mr. Watson publishes
the letter in full in his official organ, the
People's ' party paper, which comes out
to-morrow. Extracts from the let'.er
follow: .-"'â¢-'?'
Hon. Marion Butler, Chairman Ex-officio for
' Notification Committeeâ Dear Sir: Your letter
giving me formal notice of my nomination by
the People's party for the otticc of Vice-Presi
dent has been received. It is solely because of
my promise to do so that I accept the nomina
tion. . The unusual conditions confronting us
must be my excuse for submitting to the pub
lic a fair statement of the facts touching this
campaign in order that all unprejudiced may
reach just conclusions.
' ' As the time for beginning the Presidential
campaign of 1396 approached the Democratic
* party found me If in a dying condition and it j
resorted to a desperate remedy to save itself |
from dissolution. It publicly renounced the I
Kepublican policies which it has already en- i
acted into law and espoused the Populist j
creed, which it had bitterly assailed.
Having closed the doors of the mints to sil- j
ver and having sustained Mr. Cleveland in his ]
refusal to allow the seigniorage coined; hay- '
ing condoned his i>sue of bonds in violation j
of law; having acquiesced in his contraction
policy of destroying the greenbacks; having
â  helped to feed the trusts by the passage of tho i
Wilson-Gormau-Jones tariff bill, the Demo- j
cratic party, realizing that it had lost the re- j
spect, the eoniuienee and the putience of the
people, determined to anticipate the triumph \
of Populism by a public confession of politi- j
cal guilt, an earnest assertion of change of
heart and a devout acceptance of Populist
principles and a modern demand that the
People's party should vacate its quarters and
surrender its political possessions;
A very staggering piece of political impu- J
dence was this. It was cot a minority of the I
Democratic party which murdered silver in |
1893. It was a majority that did â a major- j
ity in the House, a majority in the Senate. â 
And the men who committed the. deed cannot |
now promise more solemnly to undo tneir
work than they promised in 1892 to do it. 3
Darlrg the years of 1892, '93, '94 and '95,
when Republicans and Democrats alike were
falling over each other in their effort to be
first at Wall street's feet and lowest in the
dust of political self-abasement to the trusts,
the National banks, the railroads, the bond- j
holders and gold speculators, the People's
party was the one champion of the people.
It stood fearlessly against the Hungry !
hoides of class legislation. It proclaimed con
stantly its undying antagonism to Wall street
and its policies. It held aloft the sacred ban- |
ncr of a people's rights and called for patriots I
to rise and defend the Republic. Since the |
bugle note of Roderick Duu awoke the High
lands, and the fiery cross sped through glen
end from glen to hamlet, there has been no '
such spontaneous outburst of pooular enthusi- ;
asm as marked the growth of the People's
party. One creed, one purpose, one hope, one I
Inspiration, moved us all, and had we sternly i
put temptation aside and nominated a straight |
Populist ticket at St. Louis, one man from the j
West and one from the South, we woula have j
swept this land from sea to sea.
!At Chicago the Democratic managers, hav
ing adopted the leading Populist principle!',
nominated for the first place on the ticket a '
candidate who indorses those principles.
Mr. Watson reviews the fight in the j
Populist convention at St. Louis between
the Bryan Populists and the middle-of
the-road men. He proceeds:
I was asked to allow the use of my name to
harmonize all the differences which existed
in the convention, and consented upon that
express condition.
There is no doubt that among the voters of
the Democratic party, South and West, there
was an earnest desire thai the Populists should
be met half way. Tney wished for union
among Hie advocates of silver, and they felt
that union could not be accomplished by de- j
manding any abject "surrender at the hands of
the Populists..
The leaders of the Democratic party, how
ever, secured Populist indorsement of Mr.
. Bryan by direct vote in the convention, de- I
termined to secure it for Mr. Sewali also, and
for this purpose they have resorted to the ,
policy of fusion. Instead of meeting the Pop- I
ulists half way the Democratic managers have
demanded that we furnish all the patriotism
which the occasion requires, and they not
. only refuse to make any concessions at all, but '
" they treat with public insult the party whose
votes are necessary to Democratic success. By i
listening to the overtures of Democratic man- i
agers, our party has been torn into factions, j
our leaders deceived and ensnared and the I
cause we represented permanently endan
gered, if not lost. The labor of many years is
(swept away ana tne hopes of thousands of
â¢ good people are gone with it.
Tne Democratic managers, however, not j
only claim the Populist vote for Mr. Bryau, i
who is our nominee, but they claim it also for
Mr. -ewall, who is not our. nominee, and who i
was overwhelmingly rejected v.nen offered to i
the St. Louis convention.. We are now told j
â¢ that we must not say anything against Mr. :
Bewail ; we must - not explain to the people |
wherein he is an objectionable candidate, and j
We must not mention tne fact that he is a
National banker, a bondholder,' a railroad j
magnate, a corporation millionaire, an enemy
to organized labor, a beneficiary of trusts, a
seeker after subsidies of the merchant marine
mid a protectionist of 'the iicKinley variety. ;
These things must be kept from the people, I ;
am told. Why so? Haven't the voters a right |
to know for whom they arc voting?. .. â¢ â 
Both Kansas and Colorado are Populist
States and yet the Populist nominees are not j
to receive a single electoral vote in either
State. - The 'Democratic ticket, 'Bryan and i
Sewail, will! receive them all. . In Kansas the
people have, been 1 soothed by the -assurance
that the fe wall electors wou.d vote for Wat- j
con provided 'Watson got more votes else- j
where than Sewali got.
Thus the Populists in Kansas and Colorado
have been dlÂ»/ race hi sod;* worse than that
they have been delivered to a fusion 1 where
none of "their â  votes ! count Â» fur â¢ the - Populist
ticket. 1 Th<ymust vote lor'Sewall and thus i
violate their principles. VV. â  . i
In North Carolina; where. fusion had been
arranged with the Republicans on the State j
and county ticket and with the Democrats on i
tl.e National ticket, Mr. Sewali gets anrnj >rity !
of the elector-. Â» â¢ â â¢â 
North Carolina is supposed to be a Popul!Â«t i
Bute. Upon that idea she .was allowed 95 I
votes in our National "convention. The /act
that in North Carolina we have now conceded j
a majority. of the electors to Mr. Sowalf would [
indicate tnat our vote in North Carolina has
' undergone a disastrous shrinkage since our |
National convention adjourned, or that the
National ticket has been used for mercantile
purposes ; -: -,
' / .Senator, -"a reform party 1 lias no rigfit to
e:::st if it has no valid complaint to make. j
Populists cannot denounce ihe sins of the two
ola parties and yet go into political copartner
ship with them. The moment we make treaty
the war must cease. Ana when we cease our
war upon the two old parties we have no
longer any excuse for living. Whenever right
compromises wiih wtodk, it is the r'gnt whicn
suffers.
"ftie Democratic managers seem to resent as
estrange piece of impertinence the fact that
the Populists dared lo nominate a ticket differ
ing at the rear end from theirs. Coming to
them with "2,000,000 votes they were begging
lor and piteously needing, I can say, with a
perfect assurance of telling the unqualified
truth, that my arrival on the field oi battle
has not been welcomed as neartily as Bluelier
was received by Weilinsioti at Water. oo.
They want my re-enforcements, but they don't
waut me to lead them. They need Bluclier s
troops but they druw the line at Bluchcr.
That is hardly fair, cither to Blucner or his
troops, nor is it the best way to defeat Napo
leon.
For this attitude on the pun of tlie Demo
cratic managers I believe that y>u, Senior,
Â«ru largely responsible. You made no effort
tohave me rccosnizeJ. You i>vb. icly Mated
! that I would not be notified of my nomination.
You went into Hi" fusion policy, over my
written protest, with nil tin- seal ot a man who
wanted to elect the Democratic ticket.
In this I think you were wrong- As chair
man of the Populist Committee the Darty cer
tainly expected you to do nil you could to
elect" the I'opulisi ticket. Had you demanded
Mr.Sewall's withdrawal Irom the ticket he
would have been withdrawn.- I have a letter
of yours in which you state that the Demo
cratic Committee expected you to make the
demand, but you dia not make it. From the
perversity of temper with wheh Democratic
managers have rei used to do the right thing
by the Populists it would seem that they
prefer McKinlcyism to anything which might
seem to be a partly Populist triumph. Their
double purpose is to couple election with the
complete destruction of the Pfople's party.
They mean to elect both Bryan or Sewallâ
both or neither. They cannot endure the
thought that the victory shall be shared by
Populism. They are willing to use the Popu-
I list nominee as a lever to move popular voles
i âbut not as an aliy who had any rights they
art* bound to respect.
The St. Louts compromise ticket should have
been iiisis'eil upon (or two reasons: Firs;, be
cause Mr. Bryan cannot be otherwise elected;
second, bet Vase me triumph of Bilver cannot
! be otherwise assured.
It is hardly necessary for me to say that I
| heartily indorse the platform upon which I
I was nominated. In rpeech, in editorial, in
I pampiilet, I have discu.-scd for several years
' every i^sue Populism raised, Â«nil my position
i on them all is so well known that I need go
I into no discussion of Populist principles here. ]
The position taken in this letter will be bit- i
I terly smiled. Would that the pathway of ,
i duty were always carpeted with flowers. It I
I rarely is. By making myself and the great
j party" I represent a mere iootmat for Demo
cratic politicians to wipe their leet open, I
could win much applause from that quarter.
But if I were now lacking in the loyalty wbiuu
j was expected of me when chosen I would
i grieve the men who hÃye honored me, trusted
i me, defended me and loved me.
In this reform movement to which I have
devoted eight of the best years of my life, I
have lost much â but my own self-respect lias
not been lest, nor the respect of the principles
I represented and who-e battles I have fought.
I did not seek this nomination, nor desire It.
j Had I tsked the Presidential nomination of
I the People's party and cone to St. Louis to
I claim it, no power o; the Democratic emis
-1 scries could haw kept it from me. It wns out
I of a heartfelt desire to help unite ah the
! rtform forces and at ihe same time io save my
! party and its principles from wreck that I
i agreed to accept second place on the com-
I promise ticket. I stood roalyto join hands
i with Mr. Bryan and to aid him in harmoniz
j ing Populists and silver Democrats nt'd in
! uniiing South Â»nd West, to the end that we
' might achieve a victory against McKmley and
McKinleyism. Fu6ion with Bryan mcr.nt no
sacrifice of principle. Fusion with Sewnll does.
No one regrets more profoundly than I do
that the Democratic mnnajcrs have so shaped
' the campaign that the South had ajrain been
told that she musi grovel in the dust find let
! an Eastern plutocrat put his foot upon her
I neck.
| Nor does one regret more than I cto th Â« t the
j Democratic managers in shaping their fusion
I deals, have considered those Populists only
who were getting loaves and fishes.
They have los; sight of the great army of the
1 privates, ffftoM honest heitrts and sincere
I souls form the strength of the re-eniorcamc st
i Mr. Bryan nctds. 'Ihe Populisis oi the ran k

J would d'eftr a principle tar more quickly
than they would sell. Thes? men will not vote

POOL-SELLING IN ALABAMA.
j Clergymen Slake a Untie* Effort to Break
â  Up Jlar**~ ttaclnt/. â 
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 11.â A Times
! special from Birmingham, Ala., says:
I Alabama clergymen have probaoly
j sounded the death knell of racing and
pool-selling in this State. The Birming
ham Pastors' Union yesterday, acting as a
committee for all denominations, sent to
i the State Legislature at Montgomery a
I copy of the bill by which they expect to
kill pool-selling.
The bill absolutely prohibits any sale of
i pools on horseraces* run in or out of the
State, under a penalty of $500. It con
tains a clause inflicting dissolution upon
I corporations disor-eving the law, and pro
j vides for a fine of $1000 for making books
jon races or running a poolroom. Each
; legislator has been urged to work for the
passage of the bill by personal solicita
! tion.
The movement was begun by the Pas
tors' Union of Birmineham last spring
and was occasioned by the intense excite
i ment attending the Southwest circuit
| races here last March. Afterward the
j ministry of the State gave the movement
an almost unanimous support. .. . '

"No; the Republicans will not urge or

The Cost of the Mishap Will Be in

$10,000
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 11.â The
battle-ship Texas, which has been in the
mud in the Wallabout for over forty
eight hours, will be floated into the
timber drydock three days hence.
The court of inquiry into the responsi
bility for the accident convened at 11
o'clock this morning.
All the officers who were detailed to
take part in the inquiry were present.
The court went into executive session and
announced that all future hearings of the
court would be behind closed doors.
An investigation of the injuries to the
Texas which caused her sinking on Mon
day morning last was made by the court
this afternoon. Nothing will be known in
regard to the findings of the court until
Secretary Herbert has passed upon them.
The Texas was not placed in the drv
dock to-day, as stated in a previous item.
Â£Ik; will be floated into the timber dry
dock. She must be lightened by the re
moval of 300 tons of coal.
Tne injury to the ship from the influx
of water is considerable, but is mainly
confined to the machinery. Six weeks at
least is the estimate of the time it will
take to efface all traces of the battleship's
"trip to the DOttom of the channel. 1 '
The cost of tlie accident is placed in the

TALKERS AT CONVENTIONS.
Men Who Have a Fiuice Longing to
Take Some Part, However Small.
One of the great troubles of National
conventions is the number of individuals
who are anxious to hold the floor and say
a few words, no matter how few, in the
course of ihe proceedings. Or course, the
object of most of these nests, as they nre
regarded by the presiding officer, is to
have some share in the notoriety that at
tache* to every tody actively par
ticipating In the proceedings. They
I know that if once recognized by
the cliair, the bulletins that are
sent all over the country will at least con
vey the intelligence north, south, east and
west that So and So of such and such a
State spoke or made a motion, or morel
the previous question. Then, too, if the
nominating point has been reached they
see in their imagination the crowds before
bulletin boards reading the announcement
that "Jones of New York" or "Smith of
New Mexico lakes the platform."
It does not matter a cent tnat the vast
majority of those who actually hear the
remark*, as well as of those who read
about them, never heard of Jones or Smith
beiore. The great thing is to be able to
say years afterward: "I ypoko at the con
vention when So and Fo was nominated."
As may be imagined these talkers for
] talk's sake nre detested by the political
j managers. The oest laid plans are often
put in peril by delay, and these are just
tho delegates who bring business to a
standstill.
The Populist convention has naturally
exhibited more of this sort of thing than
at Chicaeu or the Republican gathering.

Guamaro's Capture by the
Cubans Left Him No
Alternative.
An Insurgent Victory of More
Importance Than First
Reported.
CAUSES A PROFOUND SENSATION
H.vana's Excitement Over the News
Is Intensified by Rumors Frcm
Washington.
KEY WEST, Fla., Nov. 11.âPassen
gers who arrived Irom Havana to-night
bring intelligence that the capture of Gua
maro was of more importance than first
reported. Wben the news reached Ha
vana it caused great excitement. It was
only partially printed, but was wired to
Madrid and made a sensation. It is said
it so stirred the people that they forced
the Government to oblige Weyler to take
the field.
The steamer Julia, which arrived at
Havana Sunday from Nuevitas, reports no
communication with the city of Puerto
Principe since the 27th. Many bridges
have been blown up, culverts burned and
about seven kilometers of railway track
torn up. Great anxiety prevails in Nuevi
tos rejarding the fate of Puerto Principe.
The steamer brought letters detailing :he
attack on Guamaro. It appears that
General Calixto Garcia, with a large rebel
force and two pieces of artillery, attacked
the place on October 17.
The next day he captured the trenches
and destroyed ten lorts surrounding the
town. The garrison, 150 soldiers and
twenty armed citizens, surrendered, but
were ordered released, except Quarter
master Miguel Mola, who, being a Cuban,
attended the wounded. They were then
sent to Puerto Principe under an escort.
Tbe officers were patrocd. Major Mar
tinez, in command of the detachment,
was wounded in the arm and died at the
hospital as a result of the amputation.
Tne citizens of the town were forced to
aid the rebels destroy the trenches, houses,
etc. The church tower was blown up with
dynamite. Much war material was cap
tured. All stores were sacked, the owners
made prisoners and ransoms asked.
The so-called fusion of local political
parties is a farce. It was all done by cir
culation. Civil Governor P.*cura, acting
under instructions of Weyler, forced the
leaders of the party to accept. Their
resolution was taken the same day Wey
ler left for the field, who feared to leave
behind troublesome elements.
There is a great undercurrent of ill feel
ing against Weyler iv Spanish circles. It
is known that he has been pushed to take
the field. It is expected he will fail in his
campaign against Maceo. The latter is
reported stronely fortified in the moun
tains. Last night Weyler camped in the
Gohernarado hills, and news has arrived
that he had an engagement with the rebel
parties under Perico Delgado and Perico
Diaz. It is reported that Weyler was
forced to fall buck. News has also been
received that General Munoz made an
other attack on the Rubi hills, where
Maceo is supposed to be strongly en
trenched. A fierce fight is said to have
occurred, but no details are known.
Great excitement prevails at Havana,
not only on account of the above, but also
because of news received from the United
States regarding President Cleveland's
future attitude on the Cuban question.
ON A WAR FOOLING
Army and Xari/ of Thl* Country to Be
Made Heady for Trouble.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 11.â A Snn
special from Washington says: Appre
hension of trouble with Spain, growing
out of the Cudan war, has determined
PresHent Cleveland and becretaries Olney
and Herbert to put the navy on an effec
tive war footing at the earliest possible
moment.
' Since August 28 last, when Minister
Taylor at Madrid informed tne State De
partment of t:.e defiant attitude assumed
by Spain toward the linked States, vigor
ous sters have been taken to keep the
navy up to its full righting strength. Dur
ing the past few days activity has been
renewed, and orders have been issued
which show the intention of the Navy
Department to have all the ships ready
by the first of December.
On August 28 last Minister Taylor at
Madtia learned at a dinner given by the
British Embassador to the representatives
of the foreign powers that two or three
days previous the Prime Minister of
Spain had sent a note to each
Embassador saying that in view of
i the policy of the United States toward his
I Government there might follow a resent
ment of its attitude, and in that event tie
wished to be informed as to the probable
attitude of the European Governments.
The note was sent to every legation at
Madrid and but for the British represen
tative its existence would not have been
known to Minister Taylor. The morning
alter this dinner Mr. Taylor sent
to the Spanish Foreign Office a
peremptory notification that unless
the communication to the Embas
sadors was instantly withdrawn he would
demand his passports and return to Wash
ington. This severance of dip.omatic re
lations would have been followed by the
recall of the Spanish Minister at Wash
inton. The promptness and vigor of Mr.
Taylor's threat produced its effect, and
within twenty-four uours every Embassa
dor bad returned his note.
The incident became known at Wash
ington, however, at once, through acable
| gram from the Minister, and the London
and Paris Foreign Offices no doubt were
informed also of the Spanish Govern
ment's request by their representatives at
Madrid.
For months the State Department has
known that Spain is irritated and annoyed
Mt this manner in which filibustering ex
peditions depart from the southern ports
with arms and munitions for the Cuban
insurgents.
The President, however, did not realize
the extent of Spain's hostility, or that she
was secretly endeavoring to sound other
eovernments as to their feeling toward the
United States, but recently Mr, Taylor has
forwarded to Washington additional evi
dence that Spain has seriously thought of
forcing trouble with the United States in
order to escape from the Cuban dilemma.
From tne White Hous6 comes the un
official statement that there is to be no
reversal of the administration's policy,
and that iinless the situat on is decidedly
changed in Cuba trie President will ad
hero strictly to his original contention of
withholding recognition of Cuban bel
ligerency until there are stronger evi
dences of the ability of the insurgents to
maintain some lorm of government.
There is no reasonable ground to be-
Have that Mr." Cleveland contemplates any
change in his attitude between now and
March 4 unless - Weyler is utterly routed
in his present campaign and the insur
gents are enabled to seize; and hold seme
town sufficiently long to set up a govern
ment.;; '-. \Uh :Â£.';-â¢-' " : < ;. â¢'V â¢'â ;â¢â ?
While it is generally accepted in ad
ministration circles that the President
will not recommend to Congress any action
with reference to Cuba, â¢it is under
stood that he will ief?r _ to the defiance
manife-ted by Spain and warn the country
of possibilities" of " serious trouble, if in
deed, it does not occur before the meeting
of Congress. '" - ' .â .
General Miles and the military experts
of the array can -see no possible way in
which Weyler can defeat the insurgents if
his campaign as now -outlined is to be
carried out.
Further Aid fnr the Cubans.
KINGSTON. Jamaica, Nov. 11.â An im
portant expedition in aid of the insurgents

York of vital importance and stores of
medicines and clothing sailed irom here

the expedition left here have returned and
report the successful landing of the mem
bers of the party and the supplies upon
the Cuban coast.

SATOLLI TO THE POPE
Archbishop Ireland and Bishop
Keane Arraigned by the
Cardina'.
The St. Paul Prelate Is Ciustically
Spoken Of as the "Apostle
ot Heresy."
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 11.â A special
cable to the Journal from JRome says:
Cardinal Satolli has just presented to the
Pope his report on the religious questions
in the United States. Although this docu
ment is destined not to be published it is
nevertheless perfectly well known what
it contains, and lam thus in a position
to give you interesting information with
respect to it.
Cardinal Satolli makes a veritable ac
cusation acainst Bishop Keane and the
Catholic University of the United States
at Washington. He accuses Bishop
Keane of having in several pubii â¢
speeches uttered opinions which bordered
on heresy, and snys that in accord with
Archbishop Ireland he endeavored to ac
climatize a Neo-Catholicism (new Catholi
cism) on American soil.
Cardinal Satolli declares that the uni
versity at Washington had become the
heart of these ideas, where the most bold
and risky theories were put forward.
Fortunately, he says, tbe removal of
Bishop Keane has cut short the evil at its
root, but the Bishop left oehind danger
ous disciples in the persons of numerous
professors of this university, and the Car
dinal advises the Pone to deprive them, in
their turn, of their offices.
But the Cardinal shows himself much
more severe in his arraignment of Arch
bishop Ireland. He declares that this
Prelate is the creator of Neo-CathoMcism
in the United States and he formally
accuses him of being the "apostle of
heresy." ________^__
A COAT OF ARMS.
Ho* a New Family May Legitimately
Acquire One,
The practice of granting arms is still in
vogue in England, Ireland, Scotland,
Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany,
etc., and that at times the Pope, as Sov
ereign Pontiff, exercises the power is wit
nessed by Leo the Thirteenth grantine
arms to the Catholic See of Westminster
by a decree dated the SOih of June, 1894.
Indeed, it is by patent or grant alone
that a new family can legitimately acquire
a coat of arms.
The modus operandi in England, for ex
ample, is as follows: The applicant for a
patent of arms (from the crown) may Â»m
-pioy any member he pleases of the Her
alds' College, and through him present a
memorial of tne Earl Marshal of England
(who acts for the crown in these matters),
setting forth that he, the memorialist, is
not entitled to arms or cannot prove his
right to such, and praying that his Grace
the Earl Marshal will issue : is warrant to
the Kings of Arras, authorizing them to
grant and contirm to him due and proper
armorial ensigns, to be borne according to
the laws of heraldry by nim and his de
scenaants.
This memorial is presented, and a war
rant is issued by the Earl Marshal, under
which a patent of arms is made out, ex
hibiting a painting of the armorial en
signs granted, the royal arms of England,
the arms of the Earl Marshal and ihos* of
the college, and describing in official
terms the proceedings that have taken
1 iaoe, and a correct blazon of the arms.
This patent is rrg's ered in the books of
the Heralds' College, and receives the
signatures of the garter, and one or both
of the Provincial Kings of Arms.
A grant or patent of arms is made to a
man and his male descendants; this gives
him a fee simple of them, that is to say to
him and to his male descendants equally
and altogether, and to hi* femaie descend
ants in a qualified manner, i. c., for life, to
bear the arms in a lozenge, or impaled
with their nusband's arms (if the hus
bands have arms, as arms can only be
brought in by arms), or, if they be heir
esses or coheiresses, on an escutcheon of
pretense upon their husbands' shield,
and in the last case their descendants in
herit such maternal arms, but only as a
quartering. â Nineteenth Century.
Wanted a Classical Name.
A resident of Vandaiia, 111., thus de
scribes the origin of the town's name:
"The owner of the land before the place
was laid out did not possess much learn
ing, Dut wanted to appear classical.
Hence, when he concluded to start a town
he went to a friend and asked him to sug
gest a name of some famous people or city
of ancient limes. The friend was a wac
and replied : 'Well, the vandals who helped
conquer Rome were v noted people. Name
it Vandaiia, which means the home of the
vandals. Hence Vandaiia it became." â

HUNTINGTON TO
TRY ONCE MORE
Planning a Campaign for
the Funding Bill in
Congress.
Will Attempt to Secure Its
Passage at the Short
Session.
BELIEVES DELAY DANGERGU?.
One of His Friends in tbe House Al
ready Gathering Data for
a Speech.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Nov. 11.â The
Star says: It is said to be the intention
of C. P. Huntington to try to get the Pa
cific railroad funding bill through at the
coming session of Congress. One of the
leading friends of the funding measure
has already sent his private secretary here
to secure facts for a speech to be made in
the House soon after the session begins, in
favor of passing the bill, which has been
reported irom the committees of House
and Senate.
Mr. Huntington's plans are, of course,
not known, but various matters combine
to give the impression that he will seen to
put the bill on its passase at the Decem
ber session. The present House has been
thought to be favorable to funding. For
some reason the Senate is thought to stand
the same way.
The corr position of the next House will
be uncertain. Furthermore, opposition to
funding will be more patent in the next
House. The delegation which has been
elected to the House from California in
the next Congress is unanimously op
posed to the present bill. The present
delegation is unanimous, with the excep
tion if Representative Grove L.Johnson.
He was defeated this year solely, it is said,
on the ground that he wa* a friend of Mr.
Huntington and of the funding bill. A
united opposition in the next Congress
f:om California will have a strong effect,
it is urged.
Should tariff legislation engross the
coining session, there might betielayfor
the funding bill. It might have to go over
o the next Congress, but should there be
no legislation on the Dingley bill or a
kindred measure, the House would not bo
so occupied that it could not take up tbe
bill.
TO SAIL FOR VENEZUELA.
Admiral Bunco's Squadron Said to Be
Under Orders to Leave for Southern
Waters Shortly.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 11.âAd
miral Bunce's squadron will go to Vene
zuela in a few weeks, unless a radical
departure is made in the plans perfected
at the Navy Department to-day, when the
admiral came down from New York under
â unnnons from his superiors and devoted
the entire day to a discussion of the com
plex conditions that are understood to be
inseparable irom the cruise. The object
of Admiral Bunce's new orders i 3 de
clared to be without any significance in
the foreign affairs of the United States,
but relates altogether to the necessities of
effective administration.
Admiral Bunce, as well as all naval
officials, has continually urged the neces
sity of keeping ud the drills at sea, but
these require a base of operations free
rrorn ice find easy of access, in which the
whole fleet can anchor without crowding
and where coal is cheap and cood food
abundant. The Gujf of Mexico offers the
most admirable theater for such winter
operations, but the authorities have
agreed that on account of its nearness to
Cuba the presence of so large a force in
the gulf would certainly be misinter
preted at Madiid. When it was finally
conceded that the fieet must be held
together and evolutions must be had, the
only waters where the ships could be
always in readiness for hurried return to
this roast if needed was found in that
part of the Atlantic near the mouth of
the Orinoco and at the entrance of the
Caribbean Sea, well away from Havana.

HER TEN-WORD MESSAGE.
An Instance Where an At tempt t> Skel
etonize n'aÂ« I'aUf Economy.
Mr. Blodgett twirled the slip of yellow
paper thoughtfully around between his
thumb and forefinger and when he looked
up Mrs. Blodgett saw that he was about
to communicate something of considera
ble importance.
"Caroline," he said, "it isn't often that
I find fault with you because of your ex
penditures. I like to see you dress well
and keep the house up in good style and I
never begrudge you the necessary funds.
Now, do I?"
And Mrs. Blodgett admitted he never
did.
"But there's one thing I do kick about,"
went on Mr. Blodgett, "and that is the
literal throwing away of money. Listen
to this last telegram you sent me and tell
me what you think of it, viewing it iv the
light of common-sense :
" 'Dear Robert: Come directly up to the
house from the depot. I have invited
some friends for 7 o'clock dinner. Joey
had a tooth extracted yesterday. Your
loving wife, Caroline.'
"Of course 1 was glad to see our friend 3
at dinner, and it was all right about Joey's
tooth, but I should have appreciated it
just as much if you hadn't wasted so much
money in telling me about it. I don't
mind the money so much, but I do hate
to give it to the telegraph company.
Hereafter, Caroline, when you find it
necessary to send a telegram, limit your
message to ten words, it's a very easy
matter to express yourself with that num
ber of words if you ouly think so."
Then Mr. Blodgett went to St. Louis on
business. He had been there three days
and had pushed his schemes so energeti
cally that a meeting with several gentle-
I men at the Planters' Hotel on the evening
of the fourth day would, in all prob
ability, bring the deal to a successful issue.
Several hours before the time of his ap
tointment he received a telegram from
Mrs. Blodgett. It read:
"Fire Sam frightened Joey badly hurt no
ono escaped uninjured. 1 '
Mr. BJodgett poured over thÂ« unpunc
tuated message for several minutes. It
was a decided puzzle. At last his
anxious mind evolved this out of the
chaos:
''Fire. Sam frightened. Joey badly
hurt. No one escaped uninjured."
Then his fatherly heart was troubled at
the thought of his little boy's lying at
death's door and the wife of his manhood
passing into eternity without his being
there. He hastily scribbled notes of ex
planation to his "business associates and
took the first train for Chicago.
His pulse throbbed wildly and tears
coursed down his cheeks as he neared his
home, and when he saw that the house, at
least externally, was not damaged, a
prayer of thankseiving ascended ou high
and he hoped things were not quite so bad
as represented. He let himself in and
hurried upstairs. His wife was in her
room. He clasped her in his arms and
wept aloud.
'Thank heaven, you are not badly hurt,"
he cried. "Where are the children?"
"Out in the yard playing," she said.
"Wny, what on earth ails you?"
' Out playing so soon?'' he said. "W r hat
did you mean by this?" and he gave her
the telegram.
"Why, just what it says," she replied.
" 'Fire. Sam frightened Joey badly. Hurt
no one. Escaped uninjured. If I hadn't
wished to confine myself to ten words I
should have said that the fire was around
the corner, that Sam frightened Joey with
a new fa.se face, and that nil escaped un
injured, but I had to leave out words. I
thought you'd understand it all right."â

The word whoa! â used in calling on a

MANY MESSAGES
OVER THE CABLE
Protocol of the Venezuelan
Treaty Not Yet
Signed.
Continuous Correspondence Be
tween Washington and
London.
FINE DIPLOMATIC SPARRING.
Salisbury and 0 ney Carefully Survey
Every Inch of Debatable
Ground.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 11.â The
fact that the protocol of the proposed
Venezuelan treaty of arbitration has not
yet been signed is made manifest by many
signs to-day. Ti.ere has been a continu
ous exchange of cable messages on mat
ters of detail between this city and Lon
don. But that some general principle of
agreement has been determined upon is
undoubted, and has been repeatedly stated
in these dispatches.
The question of whether or not Vene
zuela is a party to the agreement appears
to be settled by the official correspondence
and by collateral facts. When Secretary
Olney, on behalf of Venezuela, made his
first peremptory demand of Great Britain
for arbitration, Lord Salisbury, after long
delay, responded with two vigorous let
ters. One of them attacked the Monroe
doctrine, claiming that Mr. Olney was
stretching it too far. The other attacked
the Venezuelan demands, asserting that
they were exorbitant.
Then President Cleveland sent into Con
gress his famous Christmas message, and
Lord Salisbury, on May 22 last, wrote to
Sir Julian Pauncelote accepting for the
first time the principles of arbitration,
but only in a partial form, and confining
it to Great Britain and the Unitsd States.
He asked Sir Julian to submit this propo
sition "to the Government of the United
States, acting as the friend of Venezuela
in this matter."
His proposition was for a commission
to be created by agreement between Great
Britain and the United States, to be com
posed of two British subjects and two citi
zens of the United States, to iavestigate
and report upon the facts without refer
ring to inferences, but the finding of the
commission to be binding upon both Gov
ernments. â¢
In this letter he distinctly specified the
United States and not Venezuela as the
party of the second part, but still there
was contained a proposition in Lord
Salisbury's letter to Sir Julian which
seemed to imply some necessity for con
sent on the part of Venezuela, inasmuch
es it was provided that on the report of the
commission being issued the two Govern
ments of Great Britain and Venezuela
should "endeavor to agree to a boundary
line," and failing agreement there should
be arbitration by three â one by Grea:
Britain, one by Venezuela and they to se
lect a thirdâ with a proviso that all settle
ments of British subjects prior to January
1, I>*7, were to be exempted.
On June 12, 189t5, Secretary Olney ac
cepted this challenge with most impor
tant modilica ions, since acceded to, pro
viding that the commission should be
amended by adding another member, so
that it must reach a result, and also pro
vided that the commission should have
power to decide the boundary question
subject to the eauitiea of each particular
case of actual settlers (since limited to
ri;ty years of undisturbed occupation).
Nowhere after this date does Venezuela
appear in the negotiations as a principal
or as having a right to select an arbitrator.
In support of the idea that the treaty is to
be between Great Britain and the United
States, the latter acting as Venezuela's
friend, it is pointed out that if
the formal assent of that republic
is required to any protocol on the
boundary question it could not be ob
tained under most favorable considera
tions until long after the admisistration of
President Cleveland will have expired by
limitation. The constitution of Venezuela
requires all treaties to be ratified by a vote
of both houses of the Legislature in joint
session. The Legislature of Venezuela
does not convene in regular session until
February next. Even it aa extra session
were to be called it would take five weeks'
notice to get it together. Under the usual
methods of procedure in Latin-American
countries the summer of 18y? would be
well advanced before the Legislature
would be ready to begin to consider the
question.
RUTH NATIONS IN ACCORD
Commissioner Oilman Says l'eace and
Good Bill Are Assured.
BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. 11.â President
Gilnian of Johns Hopkins University and
one of the members of the Venezuelan
Commission was asked to-day for his opin
ion as to whether the effect of the pub
lished decision was to make the Monroe
doctrine international law, or to establish
a virtual protectorate on the part ' of this
country over Venezuela. Hesaxd:
"It is oovious that all the data requisite
for the formation of an opinion have not
yet been made public by the United States
or Great Britain, but enough has been
&aid to show that the principle of arbitra
tion is heartily accepted by both nations
and that they are very nearly in complete
accord upon the best rcets.od of procedure,
if indeed they are not absolutely so.
"It will bÂ« time enough to consider the
relations ot the correspondence between
Lord Salisbury and Mr. Olney to the rec
ognition of the Monroe doctrine when
tnat correspondence is published. All
that need be said at the moment is that
the administration is very difficult and
embarrassing controversy has succeeded
in securing a concert of action between
the:parties interested and that this ia in
the interest of peace and international
good will. The war cloud with which the
year opened has been dissipated by argu
ments, investigations and concessions."

per.-ons most interested in improving the
country roads, and it seems a little strange
that they left the work to the wheelmen
so lonp. But a similar thing happened iv
photo.-raphy. The professional photo
graphers, working for their livelihoods,
haven't developed their own business naif
so rapidly in some directions as the ama
teurs, working lor fun. Here's where the
good citizenship comes in. The bicyclists
and the good-roads prophets are hand in
glove, according to the Washington Star.
In many of the States the League of
American Wheelmen consuls even frown
upon the construction of separate bicycle
paths, partly hesitating to divert so much
money from the common xoads, partly
fearing lest the construction of special
paths may rasult ia abridging the priyi
leges of the wheel on the thoroughfares.
This fear is probably ill-founded. Local
authorities have always exercised the
right to regulate and classify vehicles for
the good of all classes, without impugning
iheir rights where the classification ceases.
Special speedways are in many cities con
structed lor trotting horses, but the man
in the sulky uses the common roads in
going and reluming from his speedway;
and so does the equestrian, for whom
special paths have be6n laid out in most
large cities.
However this may be, motives of the
attitude of the more conservative consuls
in this matter are most emphatically those
of i:ood citizens.
Until recently New Jersey and Massa
chusetts were the two States which had
done most for their highways. The most
radical recent legislation, however, is the
new Connecticut law (statutes of 1895),
wnich pledges the State to pay one-third
the cost of one mile of road in each town
each year if the couutv and the towns will
each "pay one-tnird. The coat of one niilo
of road Is estimated at $3000.
A poor town is by this means enabled to
get a good mile of road at a direct cost to
itself of but $1000. and the most of the
general State and county cost falls on tlie
richer towns and cities. A better device
could hardly be imagined for encouraging
road improvement in the poorer regions.
Eighty-hve towns availed themselves of
the law last year, and 75 more nave already
swung into line for 1396. These are
about two-thirds of all towns in tbe little
Nutmes State. Before this year is over a
a New York cyclist may ride on good roads
nearly all the way to Boston by way of
New llaven, Hartford and Springfield.
In New Jersey road-building has been
carried on upon scientific principles, not
so much throughout the State as in Con
necticut, but rather concentrated in the
more populous counties.
SEATTLE GREETS REED
He Speaks ot the East's Kindly
Sentiment Toward the
West.
Humorous R ference to Washington
State's Heavy Vote for
Bryan.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 11.â Soon after
his arrival at Seattle at noon to-day Hon.
Thomas B. Keed of Maine wai tendered a
public reception by the Chamber of Com
merce. He made a brief address, speaking
in one of'his happiest veins.
Mr. Reed said he would not attempt to
instruct the Chamber of Commerce, for
he supposed that of Seattle was like simi
lar bodies in Maine â "knew everything
and knew it in short order." He sought
to disabuse the minds of those who be
lieved that the East had other than a feel
ing of kindness for the West, saying:
"We send you our children and our
money, and both stay."
This modest reminder of the West's
mortgaged indebtedness to the East pro
voked hearty laughter. The distinguished
speaker further observed that if the West
was slow she would "catch up, even
though certain localities were far behind,"
a twit which Mr. Reed's auditors took to
be a reference to Washington State having
gone overwhelmingly for Bryan and free
silver. Another allusion was made to this
during the reception held later in the day
Lv Mr. Reed in the parlors of the Rainier
Grand Hotel when a Republican leader
said : ,
"If we had only had you here sooner,
Mr. Reed, things would nave gone differ
ent."
This brought forth the jep\y: "No; I
am ready to claim everything, even the
earth, but I do not think I could have
materially changed the result here."
During the afternoon Air. Reed was
shown aDout the city and in the evening
he was entertained at a private dinner in
the Rainier Club by State Senator R. C.
Washburn, Governor McGraw and other
local celebrities.

"A murder was committed under rather

Chadwick had no relatives and there was

the former disappeared. By means of the
boots and a peculiarity of the teeth the
remains were identified as those of Chad

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1896.
BASEBALL CHIEFS
MEET AT CHICAGO
League Directors Award
the Pennant to the
Baltimores.
Many Noted Players and Man
agers Participate in the
Annual Session.
THE SEASON'S TIME CHANGED
Constitution Read Section by Section
and More or Less Important
Changes Made.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 11.â Baseball was
the theme of the crowd of men in the
Auditorium Hotel rotunda to-day. They
were interested in the annual meeting of
the National League and American Asso
ciation of baseball clubs, which began this
afternoon. It was preceded in the morn
ing by a meeting of the board of directors.
The directors audited the accounts of
the league and awarded the championship
pennant to Baltimore. The annual busi
ness to be presented to the league for its
consideration was arranged. The Cincin
nati club asked the board to straighten
out the old baseball park trouble in that
city. Yon ncr Ahe of St. Louis claims an
$8000 interest in the field and has attached
the gate receipts from time to time. The
board decided that it did not care to re
open the case, and as the dispute is in the
court the Cincinnati club was advised to
light out its battles there. Ihe meeting
was a brief one.
The baseball magnates who attended
were: Presideut N. E. Young of Wash
ington, A. H. Soden of Boston, Harry
Yon der Horst of Baltimore, J. Earl Wag
ner of Washington, James Hart of Chi
cago, T. H. Stucky of Louisville and P. L.
Auten of Pittsburg. At the league's an
nual meeting, which began at 2 o'clock,
there were present, in addition to those
mentioned, Andrew Freedman and Walter
Spalding of New York. John T. Brush of
Cincinnati, Chris Yon der Ahe of St.Louis
W. H. Conant of Boston, A. J. Reach and
John I. Rogers of Philadelphia, Charles
Byrne, F. A. Abells and William Barnie of
Brooklyn, and F. de H. Robinson of Cleve
land.
Others, prominent in baseball circles
and on the diamond, were at the hotel to
keep in touch with the meeting. The
league adjourned after three hours' de
liberation to meet to-morrow morning at
11 o'clock, the members to-night attend
ing the theater.
It was decided to change the opening
and closing time of the seuson so that all
games will commence April i 5 and end
October 15. Formerly the season closed
about October 1. The president of the
league and the acting chairman were
authorized to appoint a committee on
playing rules, not to exceed three in num
ber, which committee is to be instructed
to make a report of its work and any sug
gestion or alteration it deems proper in
the playing rules to the secretary of the
league at least thirty days prior to the
spring or schedules meeting. Copies of
this report are to be forwarded by the sec
retary to the respective club members at
his earliest convenience, so as to enable
all to be prepared to discuss the amend
ments made at the schedules meeting.
The constitution was read section by
section in order that any changes deemed
advisable by members might be offered.
Tbe section providing for the meeting of
the board of directors was changed so that
future meetings will be held on the first
Tuesday after the second Monday in
November instead of the first Wednesday
after the second Tuesday. Section 4 was
stricken out. It provided for the fining
of an umpire $25 for the first offense and
$50 for the second offense for not report
ing trouble with a player.
Among other matters talked of to come
before the league are a proposition to
abolish coaching, an effort to abolish the
Temple cup games, which have followed
he regular championship series and may
oe a.i attempt to put "through a deal
whereby St. Louis will have a club witb
an even winning chance instead of con
testing for tail-end place as for the last
two seasons.
STANFORD'S PRACTICE WORK.
Varsity Football Men Utilize a Dummy
for Drill in ihe Art of
Tackling.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
11.â The work of the Stafford players was
very lively last evening, and the effect of
the presence of several ex-Stanford "stars"
was plainly apparent. Clemans, the Stan
ford halfback of thelirst Varsity eleven, is
here, and will remain to coach the team
until Thanksgiving as an assistant to
Coach Cross. He will devote his chief at
tention to the backs, and from the game
last evening he is of the opinion that Stan
ford should put up a very creditable play.
Besides Clemans there were also on the
field Frankenheimer and Downing, who
will be down occasionally to put new ideas
and life into the men. Fisher and Dole
both played strong at halfback under the
supervision of the assistants. Searight
was unfortunate enough to injure his
ankle, so that it will be several days be
fore he can be out again. His work has
been decidedly strong during the past few
days.
The men are beine given practice tach
eveuing in tackling a dummy in the
gymnasium. Cross has been dissatisfied
with the tackling of the men of late and
determined to break the routine of prac
tice and improve their part of the play by
introducing the dummy tackling. As a
result the men are going around with a
soreness of muscles that do not receive
exercise in the game itself.
The second eleven elected W. P. Mcln
tosh '99 as its captain, and he has the
men playing almost as fast and hard a
game as the Var-ity itself. This is the
second year that Mclntosh has captained,
the second eleven. Stanford sweaters have
been offered to the second eleven men
this year by the football management,
and interest is therefore more apparent
than on previous occasions at this time.

WOOD PAVEMENTS.
London Han Accepted Them in Prefer-
ence to Other Materials.
The interest of toe public in the ques
tion of street paving is shown in many
ways. The bicycle has done wonders, but
beyond that there is a growing recognition
that the discomfort of bad paving is an in
fliction that the ordinary citizen bas no
rijht to tolerate. It has been said by a
modern traveler that a street in which the
pedestrians cannot converse in comfort by
reason of the rattle of carriage wheels over
the stones is nowadays a disgrace to any
municipality.
This is the keynote of the latest improve
ments in street pavement. The tendency
is toward a paving which will save the
nerve-racking din that Americans have too
long looked upon as unavoidable. The
pavement of the future will be practically
noiseless. For this purpose all tests show
indisputably the superiority of wood,
whether considered in reference to safety,
the facility with which a horse can recover
his footing, the speed at which it is safe to
travel or the gradient at whicn it may be
laid.
Recently inquiries were maie among a
large number of drivers of different kinds
of vehicle? in London to ascertain their
opinion in regard to the various pave
ments laid there, with the result that 51
declared in favor of asphalt, 197 ia favor of
granite, 219 in favor of macadam and 750
in favor of wood. The general opposition
to asphalt both there and here is signifi
cant.
It is condemned by every person who
ever drove a horse. Its surface becomes
uneven, causing a side-to-side motiou. It
is slippery in winter. It is inefficient, ex
cept for streets where there is but little
traffic and it has been generally discarded
in Europe.
The prejudice in this country against
wood only exists because of a lack of
knowledge. As it is now laid it is an
artificial stone pavement with a wood
covering, wh;ch can be easily renewed at
little expense. Its average life in London,
with repairing, is about ten years, and it
would last as long here. The statement
that it is unhealthy is unsubstantiated.
The London Engineer of Sewers says that
although some of the streets have ben
paved with wood for upward of thirty
years no complaint on that head had
reached him.
A French bacterioloeist has lately given
data which entirely disprove the idea of
the unhealthiness of wood paving. It is
now in general use in London and Paris,
r and it is indorsed by many officials who
have given careful study to the question
of modern city pavements.â G. H. G. in
Pittsburg Dispatch.
Several Shots Over It.
"Is this an ammunition me, ma'am?"
asked young Mr. Fledgeiy, as he raised
the upper crust.
"An ammunition pie, Mr. Flec.gely?"
repeated the landlady. "I don't know
what you mean by thai This is a huckle
berry pie." "
"Oh!"aaid young Mr. Fledgeiy, as he
replaced the cover; "these are huckle
berries, are they ? 1 thought it was loaded
with bird shot."
"Meu have got shot for less than that,"
â aid Mr. Billing 3.
"Or half shot," said the landlady, "with
a very small load."
Then everybody looked at young Mr.
Fledgeiy and that facetious youne man
actually blushed.â Cleveland Plain Dealer.

HOW MINES ARE
FINANCED ABROAD
Louis Janin on the Strange
Mode of Operation in
London.
No Englishman Ever Makes a
Positive Statement in
Business.
EXECUTED THRCUGH SOLICITORS
Small Syndicates, Mr. Janin Thinks,
Should Be Formed Here to
Cev.lop Mines.
Louis Janin Jr., the California mining
engineer, who for two years past has been
In Australia, and who recently sold a lead
ing gold mine in New South Wales to
London capitalists, is at the Occidental,
after having examined some local mines.
Mr. Janin says there is a far better feel
ing abroad regarding California gold mines
than formerly. In an off-hand way yester
day Mr. Janin alluded to the sentiment
abroad. Said he:
"You ask me what chance there is of
placing California mines on the London
market, or, to use a more euphonic expres
sion, what desire has the great British
public to invest in the mines of this State.
Well, just about as much desire to invest
here as in any place where there is not a
pronounced boom. The British public is
fickle, you know, and frequently changes
its loves. Witness South Africa, then the
switch to Australia, and now it appears
that it has a hankering after neither, so
that it is possible that it is quite amatory
for mines iv other localities.
"You 6ee the condition of affairs in
London is something like this: Theresas
been a large amount of money made iv
floating bad (I use the expression bad first)
and good mines in London. This money
has been realized by the so-calleu explora
tion companies. Thess companies, which
are not in reality exploration companies
in the true sense of the word (with all due
deierence to the Exploration Company of
London), are financing ana promoting
syndicates in their own camp. They have
the money, however, and tbey must invest
it. If the South African or West Australian
bcom has, in fact, ended, the directors of
these companies who love their guineas
are not going to lose their jobs, nor are the
shareholders going to lie quietly and see
their money absorbed in office expenses.
"Whether this money comes to Califor
nia or not, depends not so much on the
mines, which of course any one will admit
are good, but upon the way the schemes
are presented to the British public. Hold
on â I made a mistake, not the British
public, but the British promoter, the man
who claims to ieel the pulse of the man
who invests.
"What I meant to convey wrs that Cali
fornian and other American schemes, I
might say, are taken over to London in
very bad shape. The process is something
like this: Jones finds a mine; bonds it
,rom Smith. Jones hasn't the money to
go to London, so he organizes a little pool
among his friends, who decide not to send
him to London, but to New York. Of
course, Jones expects to make a profit on
nis bond, and his syndicate does. Well,
Jones goes to New York. He finds New
York colder than Sitka, so far as mines
are concerned. He stops at the Waldorf
lor a time, then goes to the Bowery. From
the Bowery he goes horne â provided he is
a good walker, or can get a pass. The
syndicate, having its money in. decides to
put a little more up on the bond, which
has yet not expired, and send Brown,
who, they think, has more business tact,
lo London this time. Of course, Brown
goes awuy with a good send off, and when
he arrives in London he is full of Ameri
can business energy and push.
"The first. people Brown meets (he prob
ably stops at one of the Metropole group
of hotels) are Americans. yoar
business nere?' is usually the first inquiry,
and Brown of course, if he is a typical
California^, spouts it. There is some
friend in the smoking-room who of course
can introduce him at once to a purchaser.
If one of them does not get Brown into
camp thai day, a friend from the next
hotel will visit him. If Brown's friend is
honest, he will take them to somebody in
the city, and if he is well known and in
good standing he will get attention. We

will take the most favorable position first
the thing is good enough to demand im
mediate attention. Brown is sent for, bis
papers gone over with him, and chances
are is entirely unprepared to answer many
aueations t at are put to him. Whether
Brown is a mining man or not it would be
an extremely wise policy for him to an
ticipate all questions that may be asEed.
The city firm, however, is impressed with
the mine and sends for its solicitors (you
can do no business in England without the
intervention of solicitors). It has been
said even tnat the English promoter when
visited by an American promoter, first
thinks tie man is about to get the best of
him. He then calls his solicitor in to see
whether he is or not. The solicitor de
cides no. Then both consult how to 'Mo
the American promoter and keep out of
jail. This is very probably an exaggerated
view of the case. But the London solicit
ors are a very painstaking and conscien
tious set of men who would not let their
clients buy a mine if the slightest flaw ex
isted in a title, or until they had run up
a sufficiently long bill. The chances are
that Brown is not prepared with his titles.
Oi course, thÂ«y can be sect for, and this
course is suggested. Brown sends for his
titles. The English promoter rests on
his oars. The first thing that Brown
knows, after some weeks, js that there is a
flaw in his title.. If there is no flaw some
one, hearing that Brown has already sold
the mine in England (as Brown has prob
ably written confidingly to his friends),
has begun a blackmailing Â«uit. Of course,
this part of the business is an American
peculiarity. I want to even up on what I
have said about the London solicitors.
"There is a lot of time lost, and, of
course, when you have paid money for a
time option on a property, time absolutely
is money. Finally, if the mine has not
already been examined by one of the Eng
lish firm's experts, one is sent out there.
His arrival conies pretty close to the ex
piration of the bond. Poor Brown is now
very much in a hole. Hi 3 expert is on the
ground, with a chance of ready commu
nica'Jon with the owners, when his bond
has expired, and as yet is not sure that the
London crowd will buy the property. He
calls upon them ; they assure htm that
everything is all right, and there is oniy
one little thing standing in the way of
the deal â that is, Brown and his friend's
commission. They think it abnormally
large. In fact, tbey have never
heard of such an exorbitant com
mission. (When Brown first met his
crowd it was considered most moderate.)
Yet, if Brown will take off about 90 per
cent of his commission, they think that it
may be possible for them (no Englishman
ever uses in business a positive expres
sion) to put the deal through within the
necessary time. Well, Brown's friends
will put up probably as much as they care
to, and will have to put as much more up
if the bond should expire. Possibly the
owners of the mine will have lost confi
dence in Brown's crowd. Brown knows
this and can do but one of three things â
buy the mine himself, which is out of the
question; interest a new crowd, which is
not permitted by the lack of time; or sub
mit to the extortionate reduction of his
commission or a modification of it. This
be generally does.
"The deal is finally made. Brown's,
Smith's and Robinson's reports are all
quoted in this prospectus, and they are
spoken of in the most flattering terms
terms strange to their friends and surpris
ing to themselves. Brown and his crowd
are to receive some money. This is giveii
grudgingly. A good many fully paid
shares are due to him. Now, to the aver
age mind, "fully paid" has an attractive
sound, as it means no further liability.
In England, however, it means nothing
has been paid. There are contributory
shares which the promoters and public
have subscribed for. If these are called
up to 19 shillings and 6 pence or any frac
tion of a pound they alone are good de
livery on the Stock Exchange. The fully
paid shares of Brown have little market
value. Brown didn't know this, and ac
cordingly is cinched.
"This is a true story of a friend's Eng
lish experience. For heaven's sake> don't
take it as my own. What I wish to con
vey is that few Americans who go to Lon
don know that their scheme for flotation
must be prepared as carelully for the pro
moter as a lawyer's brief. Then, again, to
escape with any money ha must learn a
gocd many tricks which the city man has
up his jacket."
"Still, are there not investors in Eng
land des;rou3 of going inÂ»o legitimate
mining investments?" was asked.
"I don't hold the British public's hand,"
he replied, "so I can't tell its pulse. But
I will say that I never found a mine-buyer
in England. Each one has a lriend in
view, which friend has another. Big fleas
with lesser ones to bite 'em. And so on ad
infinitura.
"You get a pretty clear idea of the condi
tion of affairs over there from the fore
going.
"Shares generally are underwritten;
that is to say, a certain sum of money ia
guaranteed for working capital and for
the purchase of the property. If the un
derwriter guarantees x pounds he will re
ceive, say, 3x one pound shares. If of
fered to the public and fully subscribed
for he raaps an immediate reward of three
to one. If the public does not come in his
profit must come in from market trans
actions or must depend upon the merit of
the mine."
PURE FOOD STATIONS
Four of Them Were Opened in
the City Last' Even
ing.
Milkman Must Report and Hare
Their Wares Tested Every
Night.
The four food inspecting stations pro
viaed for by the Board of Health were
opened last evening.
The stations are as evenly distributed as
possible, in order to exercise supervision
over all the sources of the City's milk
supply. No. lis at the wharf, No. 2 is at
Fourth and Berry streets, No. 3 i 8i 8 on
Alabama and Army streets and No. 4 i 8i 8
on the corner of Geary street and Central
avenue.
J. B. Dockery, the Milk Inspector, who
has charge of all these stations, was at
station 3. With him was Beu Davis, the
Meat Inspector, and a numbar of distin
guished guests, including Governor Budd,
who came early and stayed late to inspect
the workings of the new system of food in
spection.
The stations are all fitted up with the
most modern appliances for testing milk,
in which the examinations will be princi
pally concerned, and also with all tlie
comforts of home for the inspectors, There
will be four of these to each statfon, two
in a watch, and they, will have to keep the
station open all the time.
Each driver of a milk wagon must re
port at the nearest inspecting station be
fore distributing the contents of his milk
cans, and if his wares do not come up to
standard they will be dumped in the
gutter.
Last night there were lines of men and
lines of wagons waiting to be inspected at
each station, but things went smoothly
and the work was quickly done.
At station 3 only the "bulb test" was
lourd necessary, as all the milk offered
passed in good condition. It is only when
this test shows impurities that further
tests are given.
Ttiere was also a lunch served to the at
tending guests, and general enthusiasm at
this first great step toward pure food pre
vailed.
It is always a sure sign of rain when
horses and cattle stretch their necks and
sniff the air for a long time.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 11.â The offi
" cial count of election returns for San
Diego County was completed to-day,
showing Bowers to have 3702 and Castle
â¢ 3238. Bowers' plurality in the county is, I
therefore, 404.
Congressman Bowers declines to say
â¢ whether he will contest the election of his
; opponent, desiring time to study over the
matter. Yp to this evening Mr. Bowers j
i' had expressed confidence that be was re- |
Â£k ected, but official returns, showing j
Castle's plurality to be in the neighbor- '
.bood of 300, find him a greatly dlsap
â¢ pointed man. His close friends do not be
. lieve that he will make any effort to defeat
Castle, whose plurality is much larcer
than was considered possible a few days
ago.
Bowers attributes his defeat to Judge
George Puterbauph, who ran inoepen- j
dently for the Superior judgesbip, after )
failing to secure a renomination, thus, it I
is" believed, drawing many votes away
. from the regular ticket by combinations
'effected by his friends. \\\ 11. Carlson,
running independently for Congress, is
also believed to have greatly injured
. Bowers' chances. -Bowers was expected to
have a plurality of nearly 1000 in this
county, but the actual figures are less
than half that number.
Official returns from the Seventh Dis

OREVOS PEIPLE DEFRA CTiED.

PORTLAND, Or.. Nov. 11.â John Par
ker, 75 years old, representing himself as
part owner of the Lucky Hill Mining
Company in Nevada, swindled Morris Carr
of this city out of $275 and then departed
for Chicago. It is believed he has swindled
others in Portland and Oregon towns.
His method was to exhibit Jetters from
the mines, telling of wonderfully rich de
velopments. Tuen after Parker had
worked himself well into the acquaint
anceship of men and secured their confi
dence it was no trouble to get a loan of a
few hundred dollars on his personal note.
This shielded him from criminal prosecu
tion when the victim discovered that he
,had been duped, and the only recourse
Carr and others have is the Â«-ivil courts.
The police informed Carr they cou d do
nothing for him.

THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE
Mrs. Emma L. Parker Wins
Her Contest for a
Fortune.
A Jury Declares That Her Father
in-Law's Last Testament
Is Invalid.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 11.â The will of
the late George H. Parker was broken to
day, and as it now stands Mrs. Emma L.
Parker, tbe widow of Edward L. Parker,
the only son of the testator, will secure
the whole estate, which, is valued at
$150,000. 1 The verdict was that PaÂ§ker was
of unsound mind at the time the will and
both of its codicils were made. The jury
stood nine to three. This was the only
question at issue, as the charges of fraud
and undue influence were stricken out
during the trial.
Under the will, Edward L. Parker, the
husband of the contestant, was left $;SOO a
month during his lifetime, and the rest of
the property was bequeathed to relatives.
Tha first trial resulted in a disagreement,
tbe jury standing seven tÂ© five.
A stay of fifteen days was granted pro
ponents, and a new trial will be asked.
PROPOSED HIGH SCHOOL SITE.
Scheme to Erect the Structure on the State
formal Grounds.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 11.â An effort
will be made to have the new $75,000 high
school erected on part of the grounds

by the city for school purposes, and as it
is more than the State can properly care
for it is believed the State will be willing
to deed a part of it back to the city. Tbe
present plan is 10 erect the high school in
the northern portion of the square, be
ween i-ourth and Seventh streeis, and
facing the same way as the normal school.
At the meeting of the Board of Educa
tion last evenine the matter was discussed

cedure must be taken.

Against the Confessed
Murderer.
Mrs. Greenwood's Husband Fails
to Positively Identify
the Suspect.
STORY OF THE CRIME RETOLD.
The People's Counsel D?c'ares That
the Prisoner's Guilt Wi 1 B3
Establish d.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 11.â The {jial of
William Moore, charged with the murder
of Mrs. Greenwood, drew a curious crowd
that packed the courtroom lons before
the hour of beginning this morning. After
Judge Murphy announced that all was in
readiness to proceed District Attorney
Bell made the opening statement for the
people, showing what the prosecution
would attempt to prove.
"We propose to show," said he, "that
Mr. and Mrs. Greenwood were residents of
Napa Comity, living about six miles from
Napa, that Mrs. Greenwood was mur
dered on the evening of February 9. 1891,
and that Moore was the guilty person. Mr.
Greenwood was working on his farm dur
ing the afternoon of that day, fixing some
fences. In the afternoon Mrs. Greenwood
visited friends, and was not at home
when Mr. Greenwood returned to the
houÂ«e. Mr. Greenwood then began doing
some work in the yard, when two men â
William Moore and Carl Schmidtâen
tered the yard and approached. They li rat
a<Ked for work, and then something to
eat. Being refused, these two men,
Moore and Schmidt, drew pistols, ordered
Mr. Greenwood into the house and bound
him to a chair. A poisonous liquid was
then administered to him.
"When Mrs. Greenwood returned she
was taken to her bedroom, where a poison
ous liquid was also administered to her.
The liquid will be proved by expert testi
mony to have been poisonous. Daring
the visit of these men Mr. Greenwood was
shot two or three times and almost killed.
"That is the evidence in regard to the
murder.- We will prove," continued the j
District Attorney, "that Moore is" the
euilty party, for the following reasons:
Moore had formerly worked for Lynch.
Certain jewelry â a watch, chain and ring â
owned by Moore while working for Lynch I
was similar to that worn by the man who
committed tne murder. While working
for Lynch Moore had a bottle of poisonous
liquid like that used in the murder. Two
weeks previous to the murder Moore left
the employ of Lynch, but had been seen
on the afternoon of February 8 at Yallejo.
On February 9 . Moore and Schmidt left
Vallejo and started* toward Napa, and thy
were seen near the Greenwood place n
short time previous to the commission of
the crime. Late on the night of the mur
der Moore ana Schmidt were seen at the
German House. The confession of Moore
to Mrs. Meyse, Sheriff Bnrr and others of
Los Angeles and to Sheriff McKenzie and
others of Napa would also tend to prove
his guilt." ...
. Tne District Attorney closed his state
ment to the jury :by saying : "We expect
you to return a verdict of guilty of mur
der in the first degree." .
There are thirty-two witnesses lor the
prosecution and eight for the defense.
John Q. Greenwood was the first called.
His testimony.. in reference to the murder
was in accordance with the statement of
the District Attorney, except that he re
lated very minutely what happened on
that eventful night. Moore was brought
before Greenwood for identification. Mr.
Greenwood said:
"I can't swear that he is the man, but
he is very much like the murderer of my
wife; but I am not positive that he is the
man." â  â  * â¢
Physicians gave testimony regarding the
poison that had been administered to
Mrs. Greenwood and the case was con
tinned until to-morrow.^^^^^^^^^^^H

POSSES RETURN TO USAL
Two Mudgett Murder Suspects
Still at Large in the
Mountains.
Search Will Ba R sumed After the
Hearing of Those Under
Arrest.
CAHTO, Cal.. Nov. 11.â The sheriff's
officers returned to Uaal to-night, having
failed to effect the capture of Smith and
Noble, the last of the quartet suspected of
complicity in the murder of rancher John
Mudgett. Deputy Sheriffs Hart and Day
say they have the two men located and do
not anticipate any great difficulty in
effecting their capture. The preliminary
hearing of the Dodge family and Ferguson,
which is set for to-morrow, requires the
presence of the officers, hence their
abandonment of the pursuit, for the
present.
The evidence against the Dodge family
ii strongly circumstantial. The family is
known to have been sorely pressed for
money for some time prior to the murder,
and immediately afterward young Dodge
endeavored to negotiate a drait that was
payabl- to Mudgett. Other members of
the family suddenly became possessed of
money and made lavish expenditures.
This in itÂ«elf seeme<r abundant reason for
holding them for trial. District Attorney
Sturtevant of Ukiah and Judge Bainbridge
of Usal will conduct the hearing.
There is a noticeable lull in the excite
ment to-day as compared with yesterday.
The community is apparently satisfied to
await the result of the examination. The
prisoners are well guarded.
IS FELT IN RICHMOND
McKinley's Election Gives an
Impetus to Business in
the West.
Beneficial Effects- Already Apparent
in R al Estate and Im
provements.
"Richmond by the sea" has already felt
the effects of the election of President
McKinley. Inside of - the short space of
one wees confidence in the stability of the
country has had the effect of bringing the
Richmond district into .'.touch, with the
good news from other portions of the
country.
T. G. Parker, the principal real estate
! agent for the Richmond district, who was
a candidate for Supervisor of the Twelfth
Ward, said :
"I am willing to confess, although I was
a Bryan man, that I have noticed an im
provement already in this section. The
people nave < confidence now, whereas be
fore the election they were in doubt about
investing their money.
"I have rented, four houses and two
stores since election) day, and have had
inquiries ' for choice pieces of property.
Consequently 1 am willing to confess that
; the people who voted- for McKinley were
i right, while yet I believe Bryan is a great
i man." ,
In addition to Mr. Parker's opinion
others in Richmond have felt the good in
! fluence. F. M. Flugeer, I who ; owns the
j Boulevard, on the southwest corner â of
j First and Point Lob 0.1 avenues, had ;an
! offer on last Sunday of $1050 for ; his sa
j loon and two-story, building, which he de
clined. This probably is owing, to the
j fact that First avenue, between Point
! Lobos and the park, is about to be bi
| tuminized in the near future and made a
boulevard. ' â  '
In addition to this, the streets and ave
nues running through the old racetracK
are being laid out and .will ou macad
amized just as soon as suitable sewers are
! run through them. *
On the opposite corner to that of Flug-
I ger's, where the big sand hill stood for
centuries on the irregular lot facing the
j Odd Fellows | Cemetery, a $7000 building is
i now in course of ereciiou. : This property
I is owned ;â¢ by Sirs. heeland, and ; the'
I building is being put up by Edward Cox
for the sum mentioned, it will consist of
a store and five fiats, and will, when fin
istied, be a decided improvement to this
section of Richmond.

I Richmond District. " V A store and two flats

PORTLAND, Or, Nov. 11. â Three
years ago William Davrey, the owner of a
farm near Vancouver, Wash., went to Ari
zona to engage in mining, a pursuit in
which he believed he could the more read
ily lift a mortage resting upoA his place.
Davrey at that time was about 32 years
old. He left behind two children and a
wife, whom he had reason to believe was
both loving and faithful.
It appears that Davrey succeeded fairly |
well, for, from time to time, he remitted
money to his wife to assist in freeing his
farm from debt. Recently Mrs. Davrey re
ceived a $300 draft Irom her husband for
that purpose, and in reply she wrote to
I him that she would no longer consider
herself his wife, and asked his advice as
to what disposition should be made of
j their children. He at once took his de
parture from Arizona for home, but when
he reached Vancouver, two days ago, his |
wife was not there to bid him welcome, j
I He learned that tne last $300 he remitted
I had not been applied to the j art cancela- j
tion of the mortgage upon his farm, bnt j
that the faithless woman had appropri- j
ated it to her own use. Then he ascer
: tamed' that bis wife had eloped with Ray
â  Cleary, a deserting private soldier from
I the barrack-. Her two children she left t
I with Iriend3 in Vaucouver. but early last
< week she sent for her four-year-old
â  daughter.
Davrey, accompanied by Sheriff Miller
of Vancouver, came to Portland yesterday
in the hope of finding the pair. The de
| ceived husband stated that he had no fur- I
I ther use for his runaway wife, but all he
wanted was nis little girl and the $300 his
I wife had robbed him of. All they suc
ceeded in learning was that Mrs. Davrey
and Cleary bad left for San Francisco last
I Thurday.
By this time all the military authorities
I on the coast have been notified of Cleary's
j desertion, and his being handicapped by
the woman and her child will make his
capture an easy matter, providing he and
1 Mrs. Davrey really have gone to San Fran
cisco.

this time affirmed the judgment of the
lower court in restraining the State
Treasurer from honoring the $25,000 war
rants issued in payment for a site for the

Oregon. The court holds that payment
of warrants would bo a misapplication of
public money because the constitution

of the employes of tbe uashouse, and fol
lowing the sonnd they found McDoweil
lying in a helpless condition near the
engine. He had wandered into the yard
near the big engine-room to sleep, "and
laid down too near the mouth of the steam

turned on he stumbled still further along

The United States owes much to the

During the coming decade we should

will bring the highest price.
The agitator has a good chance to re

him an opponuuity to work something

Embassador Bayard may be a diplomat

It is said that Cleveland's message will

which is equivalent to a warning that it

The report of a bread riot in India con
firms belief in the wide extent and severity
of the famine, ana once more the price of
wheat goes up and speculators are happy.
The arguments for the Nicaragua canal
are well worn, but we must keep on re
peating them. It will never do to let the
big enterprise get out of the public mind.
The Chamber of Commerce did well in
sending a memorial to Cleveland on the
Nicaragua canal, and it is to be hoped his
me:-sage will show that he profited by the
suggestion.
Unity of effort is all we need to make
California the riost progressive State in
tbe Union during the coming decade, and
to that end all leaders of public sentiment
should direct their efforts.
When General Weyler gets to the front
in Cubii the telegraph wires will be kept

up by a pursuit of tbe enemy.
No harm -would be done in enlarging
the Cabinet by the appointment of a Sac
retary of Mines and Mining. McKinley
has friends enough just now to be able to
lill the place without d.fficulty.
It is a happy coincidence that the open
ing of the new era of prosperity has been
attended by the meeting of the Miners'
Convention, for there is no idle metaphor
in the word when they tain of gold.
Chairman Neff's address to the Miners'
Convention was one of the ablest papers
ever read before an industrial assembly in
California and should ba printed in pam
phlet form for permanent preservation.
There are hundreds of millions of dol
lars' worth of gold in our mountains, and
it is certainly worth while for the Govern
ment to exp nd some hundreds of thou
sands in aiding the work to bring it out.
As a result of the European demand for
American grain the Atlantic has hardly
ships enough to carry it over as quiefcly
os desired and freight rates have nearly
doubled. Unfortunately most of the snips
belong to foreigners, and the profits in the
hiÂ£b rates are not on this side of the
water.
The Canadian desire for reciprocity of
trade is hardly likely to be reciprocated
by any Jarge number ot our people. She
could offer a pretty good market for our
Bemi-tropical fruit, but nearly &U her in
dustries compete with those of the United
Slates and reciprocity would simply give
her a very large market in return for a
very small one.
Hydraulic mining can be conducted in
such a way as to work no injury to the
valleys, and the valley people can guard
their interests without injuring the
miner?. That much has been made clear
by tbe Miners' and the Anti-Debris asso
ciations, and the way i 9i 9 now open for
unity <M effort and the promotion of the
welfare of both farmers and miners.
UNITY OF ACTION.
There is one passage in the address of
Chairman Neff to the Miners' Convention
which should be read, studied and taught
in every section of California. It is that
portion in which he describes the means
by which the long struggle for a revival of
hydraulic mining was accomplished with
victory and the present promising condi
tion of the industry established.
After speaking of the controversy be
tween the hydraulic miners and the people
in tne valleys and along the river bottoms,
and stating bow hydraulic mining had
been for a time prevnnted by the opposi
tion, he went on to narrate the steps by
which the miners represented by the
Miners' Association and the valley men
represented by the Anti-Debris Associa
tion had reached an amicable agreement
and devised a plan unÂ«ler which the min
ing industry could be revived and carried
on to even a greater extent than before,
not only without injury to the valleys but
with the hearty co-operation of all who
live in th^m.
Commenting on this, Chairman Neff
said: "Unity of action and fair minded
ness achieved a victory where individual
effort, controversy and litigation bad
failed." The victory thus gained lea to
other successes. The unity of effort
brought about by fair dealing between the
parties mainly interested in the struggle
awoke the cordial sympathies of the peo
ple at large and in a comparatively short
time the wnoie strength of the State was
exerted in support of the long depressed
industry.
Speaking of the support which came so
generally from all parts of the Stale Mr.
Neff declared: "When our first convention
adjourned and we organized tire Jaiifor
nia Miners' Association we real zed that
we hail the assistance and the moral sup
port of the people and the press. We
were given a backing far beyond what was
even expected. The Chamber of Com
merce, the Board of Trade, the Board of
Supervisors indorsed our memorial and
our objects as did tho boards of Supervi
sors throughout the interior counties."
The result of ibis hearty co-operation
was shown in the success attained in pro
curing neede 1 legislation at Washington.
The moral to be drawn from the case is
too clear to need pointing out. Unity of
action is for the people of California the
means of accomplishing victory. If those
whose interests seem to be opposed will
m et together and seek for some plan of
harmonious effort they can fairly count
upon receiving the support both of iha
press anu of the people. Wnen that ha 3
been secured the rest will be certain. We
sdould prorit by the miners' example dur
ing the coming decade. Let us work to
gether and there will be many a great in
dustry promoted in this State aa success
fully as that of hylrauic raining.
KEEP AT IT.
The memorial addressed by the Cham
ber of Commerce to President Cleveland,
calling his attention to the necessity for a
prompt construction of the Nicaragua
canal, deals with an old subject, but is
nevertheless timely. The President is
now preparing his annual message to Con
gress, and it was weil to remind him bow
great is the interest that commercial bodies
take in this important enterprise.
Because so much has been said about
the Nicaragua canal, many people have
grown weary of the topic and are inclined
for the mere sake of novelty to turn to
other enterprises. Tiie?e people, however,
are not of the kind that achieve success in
vast undertakings. The way to win against
great obsiacies and to triumph over
mighty difficulties is, in the emphatic
language of Lincoln, "to keep eternally
ai it."
It was by such tactics the Union armies
made their way to Jtichrsond, and it is by
such tactics only that we can accomplish
success in the construction of the Nica
ragua canal and secure to California that
greatly needed waterway.
If Mr. Cleveland should urge the adop
tion by this Congress of measures provid
ing for the construction of the canal it la
certain his recommendation would have
considerable weight. The present condi
tion of the Senate is such that legislation
! on matters of partisan politics can hardly
jbe expected this winter. There will be all
the more time therefore for considering
non-partisan measures like that of the
construction of the canal, and ail the
i more reason for doing so.
The preliminary work of legislation on
the subject has been already performed.
Bills providing for the construction are
I now before both houses of Congress. It
1 ought to be possible for all who are inter
ested in tbe subject to harmon.ze their
differences of opinion and agree upon'one
of them. If the Presiuent exerts his in
fluence, with his supporters and friends
he might have the satisfaction of sinning
a bill that will add luster to his adminis
tration and to some extent redeem the
disasters which have resulted to the
country from bad legislation during his
I term of office.
Whether the President favors tbe bill or
not, the Chamber of Commerce did well
in calling his attention to it. The snbject
is old and worn, it is true, but until the
great work has been accomplished it can
never be talked about too much. Let us
keep eternally at it.
CANADIAN RECIPROCITY.
It is reported that the Canadian Minis
ter of Finance will send representatives
to Washington immediately after the in
auguration of President McKinley to ad
vocate a treaty arranging :or reciprocity
of trade between Canada and the Unit d
States. The question will be an import
ant one for the next administration and
is certain to give rise to no little discus
sion in all parts of this country.
The Republican party is of course favor
able to reciprocity. Suc.h treaties are a
part of those great measures which were
devised by Mr. Bluine for promoting
American industries and advancing
American commerce. There will be,
therefore, a sentiment favorable to reci
procity with Canada in the next Congress,
and unless grave reasons prevent it such
a treaty will probably be made.
It is certain, however, that no such
treaty will be possible as that of 1854,
which the Canadians desire. The relations
of Canada to the United States are such
that sh9 is a competitor in almost all of
our industries and can offer us no such
market as she would gain by reciprocity.
Her coal, her lumber, her wool and ail
her farm products come into direct com
petition with the great industries of the
greater portion of the United States.
The only products in this country to
wheh she could offer a non-competing
market would be those ol the semi-tropi'-al
regions of our country. The cotton of the
South and most of the fruits of California
might find a good market there, but to
Wi. at products of Canada could we open
our markets without injury to our own
industries?
It is easy enongh to arrange reciprocity
treaties with countries that buy American
manufactures, pork, beÂ«f, grain and
wool, but it is not so easy to arrange
them with countries that produce all
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1896.
these thincs for themselves, it is this
condition of things that stands in the way
of Canada's desire for reciprocity of trade
with our people. She produces the same
things as ourselves and she produces more
than she can use at home. Her rates of
wages are lower than ours, and the com
petition with American, industry would
not be fair.
It seems clear therefore that while some
treaty with our neighbor on the north
may be arranged, it will not be anything
like as comprehensive in its scope as
those with ottier countries whose prod uct3
are not so similar to our own.
A HAPPY CONVENTION.
The annual convention of the California
Miners' Association, which adjourned yes
terday, was one of the most remarkably
barpy gatherings ever held in California.
The candidate; lor the offices were
happy because they were tne incumbents,
because nobody wanted to run against
them and because they were elected by
acclamation. Tbe movers of motions
were happy because every motion re
ceived a second and was carried
unanimously save in one solitary
instance toward the close of tbe
session when one delegate moved that the
convention be held once a month. The
ayes and noes were about divided on the
proposition, but the chairman decided in
favor of the noes. The father of the motion,
not to be put down, made another to the
effect that the convention should meet
once in three months, and on an equal
vote the chair decided in his favor, so ho
was happy at last.
Governor Budd and Congressman Bar
ham were happy because the delegates
arose in their seats and gave them three
rousing cheers with the old-time hearti
ness of the miner of '49.
Senator Ford was happy because the
miners presented him witli an elegant sil
ver and china testimonial for his services to
them at Washington. He was so happy
that he almost wept, and tbe noble
hearted miners wee happy because they
saw that their affection had touched bis
heart.
The only man who did not seem to be
happy was Senator White, but he was not
in the convention. He wrote a letter say
ing he was unhappy because he could not
attend.
There was good news before them, too.
The prospects were more th.tn favorable
that Congress would eive them the legisla
tion which they needed, and that there
was no doubt whatever that tlie bic dams,
for whic $500,000 had been appropriated,
would be constructed at an early date.
Tne assoc ation has been of incalculable
benefit to the mining industry of Califor
nia, and it carries with it in session and
out of session the good wishes of tbe
people of the State.
THE EFFECT OF COMPETITION.
The Call pubii-hed yesterday an inter
esting installment from the report to be
submitted by the Kailroad Commission 10
the Governor. It dealt with the conten
iion of the Southern Pacific Company that
freight rates could not be reduced in the
dan Joaquin without ruin, and points out
that after the monopoly had made that
jileu against the efforts of the commission
to reduce rates, it made the reduction
itself as soon as the Valley road entered
the field as a competing line.
Two things are apparent iv this state
ment of fact. The lirst is that the a^er
tiona of the monopoly are not aJways to
be relied upon. Their cries of "confisca
tion" may be only a clamor for tne pur
pose of covering extortion, bince what
they said about reducing rates in the San
Joaquin has bten proven untrue, tne pub
lic will be justified in remaining incred
ulous concerning ail similar ass rtions
from the same source.
Tbe second joint is the clear evidence
afforded that ihe only sure way of dealing
with monopoly is to establish competition.
What railroad commissions have failed to
do and what even tbe courts can hardly
effect, and only with much delay and at
great cost, the construction of a competing
iine wili effect with certainty.
Moreover, good work done by the com
mission and the courts could operate well
only for a time. Witli changed condi
tions it would be necessary to do the work
all over again. Competition, however,
works steadfastly aud continuously
through ail seasons and through all
changes of condition. It redresses bal
ances, automatically. It breaks down
monopoly by tbe natural operation of
commercial law. In fact, where there is
competition there is no monopoly.
Ihe peoile of the San Joaquin are profit
ing now irom what lias been done by the
Valley roaci, and other sections of the
State still within the cinch of the mo
nopoly can learn from this example how
to lrte themselves by co-operating to
gether and giving aid to capital in estab
lishing new roads.

A CLEAN CAMPAIGN
Chicago Chronicle.
In one respect the political campaign which
has j ist closed has been in tiie main rather
cratifylug than otherwise, and that is there
has been so little of what is called "mud sling
ing."
Comparatively few attacks have been made
on the personal character of candidates, few
attempts made to smirch them by "dressing
up" old nt< ries into scandals, by putting de
famatory construction on stories whim utlght
easily bear another, or by wholesale inveu
tluns in the same xeneral direction.
This may argue that parties have been gen
erally more careful than on some other occa
sions in the selection of their candidates, or it
may nit an that when the issues at stake in
any campaign are deep, vital and far-retching
men s minus are given to them rather than to
the men chosen to stand for them.
In either event the fact is, for what it is
worth, gratifyiug. The calumnious character
of our political tactics has been sharply cen
sured at home and abroad. It is pleasant to
know that one of the most exciting campaigns
in our history has Deen conducted with so
little resort to tactics of that type.
DRIFT OF POWER TO THE WEST.
Boston Globe.
The campaign that has just ended is a very
interesting reminder of the general drift of
population In the land. The National political
canter follows the center ol gravity of popula
tion. That center is not fir from Chicago,
aud the tremendous excitement that has
shaken the so-called doubtful States in this
campaign, while comparative quiet has reigned
in the East, is the natural r sul t of the drift of
our National development.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS
'â¢Did you ever hear such playing!' "Isn't it
wonderful!" These and similar ejaculations
could be heard as the audience went home ou
Tuesday night after listening to Fannie Bloom
fleld Zelsler at the Metropolitan Temple.
Mme. Zeisler was known here as a resident of
Chicago, who had studied in Vienna with
Lesziticki, PaderewsKi's master. As she
stepped upon a San Francisco platform for the
first time the audience greeted her warmly.
It was not till she had played that the audi
ence realized what a genius was among them.
Bach's Toccata and Fugue iv D minor (tran
scribed by Tausig) had been chosen as the
opening number, and although the interpre
tation was a triflo cold It brought out at once
Mme. Zeisler's masterly technique.
Her wrist power is eiceotional and her
touch velvety, pure and finished. In direct
contrast to the "Fugue" was the little Minuet
in E flat major and the Bagatelle by Beetho
ven. The selections from "The Ruins of
Athens" (chorus of Dervishes, transcribed by
MME. BLOOMFIELD ZEISLER, the Pianiste Who Created Such a
Remarkable Furor on Tuesday,
Saint-Saens) and Rubinstein's transcription of
the Turkish March showed off her powers
fcffectually. The latterâ a piece de resistance
o; the late Anton Rubinsteinâ is a stuay in
crescendo and decrescendo, and well fitted to
show off the gigantic strength he possessed.
Mme. Zeisler interpreted this deiightiully,
even though hers was a "feminine edition,"
All musicians are aware of tbe enormous
technical, and one might say intellectual, dif
ficulties of Schumann's "Eludes Sympho
n;ques" (Op. 13). Mme. Zeisier interpreted
this iv a masterly manner, bringing out
vividly the various tone Dictures coutai: ed
therein. Fur an encore she gave a serenade
by Samiti.ski.
After an "Impromptu" by Chopin (Op 36)
came hie well-known Valse No. 1 (O|-. 64).
Her strongly characteristic renditiou of this
br< ught down the huuse, and she repeated the
number for an encore.
Mubzkowski'g "Gondoliera" (Op. 41) and
Liszt's "Twelfth Rhapsodic" brought the pro
gramme to a close. The audience rose en
nittsse, actually shouting, and ii.s.tad of going
home demanded another encore, which Mme.
Zcl.ler obllgingiy gave by playing a com posi
tion of Lessiilcki's, "Lea Deux Aioueues."
All sorts of rumors are rife about the libretto
of "Messidor," which Emile Zola is writing
lor Alired Bruncau. Mauy of the papers state
that "Meshidor" is only the scenic develop
ment of "Uerminal," but this does not seem
probable, for to adapt ihe finale of "Germiual"
to stage purposes would ba to make nricks
without straw. The ending of tne novel is
tragic in its veiled mci.ace to society, but there
is no food for the dramatist. Etieune h&s
been tryiug unsuccessfully to carry ou a strike
among thÂ« downtrodden coal-miners of Mont
sou, and in the early dawn of a spring morn
ing he turns his back on the village of
wretched hovels wuere his coinraJcs must toil
on. Every wliere the hedges aud Uoea are
burs ti.ig into blossom, the sap of new life is stir
ring the earth, and deep down in the ground
his comrades are picking with their axes. In
the morning of the young year, the country is
bursting into life, and below the furrows of
spritigiug corn is growing a black revengeful
army springing up s.owly for the harvest of
the next century. The book cone udes with
the prophecy that this army w:l! "bientot
faire eclater la terre," a tragic motive enough,
but one which the successlul au:hor of "L'At
laque dv Moulin" would scarcely use for a
libretto.
Every one has laughed at instances of bucolic
musical criticism, wh*e the man who does
prize-fights haÂ» been detailed to Â«ive the local
choral society a write-up, aud proceeds to do
it in the terms of tho prize ring. This is noth
ing, however, to some of the blunders which
have recently been made on the subject of
music in Ei. gland. No less a paper than the
Pall Mall Gazette let loose one of its bright
young men to report the memorial service to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury, in West
minster Abbey, tnd among other items of
news, he conveyed the pausing information
that Dr. Purcell presided at the organ. 'Now,
as the bicentenary of the eateenu-d doctor's
birth was recently celebrated with great cere
mony in Westminster Abbey, it is to be feared
that the reporter was what is known to the
vulgar as "talking through his hat," lor hud
Dr. Purcell risen irom his honored turab "lor
one day only" the other reporters would surely
have discovered tne phenomenon. Even the
Pall iail Gazette's piece of news is surpassed,
however, by the sermon of an eloquent
preacher during a receut musical lestival.who
descanted with great feeling upon the emo
tions experienced by Handel when he first
heard the Baal choruses iv "The Elijaa."
Several Roman newspapers make the state
ment that Edward Sonzogno, the famous im
presario and publisher, intends to give up his
Lyric Theater iv Milau and all other theatri
cal enterprises and retire into private life. If
this ..ews be true it announces a great blow to
lyric art in Italy, for Sonzogno has bncu a
liberal patron both of singers and composers
and has done more than any other man lor the
music of "young" Italy.
Tho latest musical fad in British society
circlts is for ladies to learn the bagpipes. It
is a pleasing instrument, on its native "tcotch
heath, and heard half a mile or so away amnne
the mountains its effect is most romantic, but
the bagpipes in a room, played by a beginner.
Is probably the worst form of torture which
society has yet invented in the name of musi
cal diversion. Every one does not know it, but
the bagpipes is an instrument that requires
skill and musical ability to play successfully.
We hear a great deal of fervid admiration

THIRTEEN AT THE TABLE
Mayor-Elect Pbelaii and HisH
Official Guests at
Dinner.
Qu et Gathering at Wuich There Were
No Set Speeches and Very
Little Fjrmality.
Mayor-elect Phelan gave a banquet last
evening at the Maison Riche, his guests
being the members of tbe newly elected
Board of Supervisors and City officers.
The purpose of the gathering was that
those who will administer the affairs of
San Franci^o during the ensuing term
misrht become acquainted. Mayor-elect
Phelnn in this followed the precedent set
by several of his predecessors, who have
banqueted before beginning the actual per
formance of official duties.
The banquet took place in one of the
private dining-rooms. This had been dec
orated appropriately for the occasion. On
the mantelpiece, reflected back by the
large mirror, were a bunch i f daisies, and
on the banquet-board were iarce and
handsome chrysanthemums. The gentle
men wore all gathered in a circle, passing
the night at a round table.
When the host aud his quests were
seated there was one vacant chair. Covers
had been laid for fourteen persons, that
number, including Mayor-elect Phelan,
having been expected to be present. Su

Over a Score of Ships Got In From Foreign Ports Yesterday. During the Night Some of Them "Were Dangerously Close to Each
Other and the Larnaca and Pierre Corneille Were in Collision.

Two Ships Caused Trouble
Off the Port Yester

The British Ship Larnaca Was
Run Into by the Pierre
Corneille.
A VERY NARROW ESCAPE.
Passengers .on the Monowai Wil
Have Turkey on Tuaaksgiy
ing Day.
The recent northwester has brought in
quite a fleet of ships from Australia and
South America. Many of the vessels had
quite uneventful passages, but some of
them met with disaster off the Golden
Gate. Two of the fleet were in collision,
and one of them had its flag at half mast.
When the sun set last Tuesday evening
the sea between the Golden Gate and the
Farallones waa dotted with the saili of in
bound -hips. When the sun rose yester
day morning the fleet had been increased
by many vessels that had crept up in the
night, aud all were anxious to make port.
Every one of them came along under all
the bail she could carry, but "on one alone
the sunbeams shone whose flag was half
mast high." She is the American ship
Francis, and Captain Smith has the re
mains of his wife aboard. Mrs. Smith was
a very sick woman and the doctors recom
mended a sea voyage. Her husband
brought her with him, but she began to
fail after rounding the Horn. A month
ago dropsy set in and twelve days ago she
died. Captain Smith would not bury me
body and bad it sealed up in a casket and
brought it to San Francisco. The remains
will i c buried here.
With so many vessels outside and all
eager to make port a co iision was quite
likely. The British shjp Larnaca was
bound here, but a tiu put a message
aboard ordering the captain to sail onto
Portland. The ship was accordingly run
ning free when the Freiuh ship Pierre
Corheille came bowling along >n the jar
board tack and struck i..c Larnaca amid
-hip. The latter had a narrow escape.
Her starboard bulwarks were crushed in
and the rail torn away. Her fore and
main topgallant backstays were cut and a
number of chain piates were cut.
The Corncille los her headgear and for
several minutes was badly tangled up.
Finally both vcs-els got clear and the tug
Vigilant towed the Larnaca into port, and
the SÂ«a Witch brought la the Pierre Cor
neille. The report from the two vessels is
as follows:
The French bark Pierre Cornellle, bound in.
and the B itish ship Lamaca, which received
orders to proceed to Portland, Or. , were in col
lision off tne :;Â«ads. The Pierre Corneille had
her headgear carried away.
Per British ship Lurnucaâ November 11. at
1 :45 a. IT., three miles outside the whistling
buoy, wm .:tandinij to the southwest on the
starboard tack, when the French bark Pierre
Corneille, bound in, struck the I.nrnaca on the
starbo.rd side forward of the main rigging,
cutting through iÂ»ulwÂ«rks and rail and two
plates, carrvii g awuy fore and main topmast
backstay and several chain plates.
Where the fault rests remains to be seen.
Captain Miller, as pilot, was in charge of
the Frenchman, and the boatmen along
the front assert that when he ordered the
helmsman to starboard his helm he put it
port, thus causing the damage. Others
say that the morning was so clear and
beautiful that it was easy to miÂ»judgedis
tances. Miller is one of the most compe
tent pilots on the coast, but. nevertheless,
he will have to stand trial on the charge
of having placed his vessel in a dangerous
position.
Among the arrivals yesterday were:
The British ship Alcinos, 102 days from
Cape Town; the British ship Genista, 129
days from Liverpool; the British bark In
verneill, 151 days from London ; the
British bark Northemay, 42 days from
Autofogasta; the British ship Glenfinnrt,
132 days from Swansea; th* French bark
Pierre Corneille, 50 days from Newcastle,
N. 8. W. ; tue .British ship Laurelbank,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1596.
73 days from Newcastle, N. S. W., and the
British ship Lanaca, 48 days from New
castle, N S. W. In addition to these the
following were outside and will pass in
before 5 o'clock to-nlsht: British ship
Rnuddian Castle, Newcastle, N. S. W. ;
British ship Crown oi Germany, from
Panama; British bark Blairlogie, from
Talcahuano, and French bark Reine
Blanche, from Swansea, and the Crown
of England, 139 days from Antwerp.
Beveral of the vessels bring eeneral car
goes, others bring coal and many are in
ballast.
The Rhuddian Castle was on fire in the
after-hatch on October '22, but after dig
ging down seven or eight feet and throw
ing overboard ten tons of coal the danger
was averted.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Monowai sails for Australia this after
noon. The American passengers have not
been forgotten, and Thanksgiving day will
be duly celebrated. The steamer will be
in the vicinity of Samoa on the occasion,
bat Chief Steward Naismith has every
thing in trim. Should the crate of live
turkeys he has on board die on the way
there are over 500 pounds of the dead bird
stored away in the refrigerator, so that no
one on the Monowai will be without a
slice of the royal fowl on the 26ih inst. As
a caterer Chief Naisni'th stands at the top,
and althougu be is an Englishman, upon
an English ship, he can be depended upon
to set a truly American dinner on Thanks
giving day.
Once a year the Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers have to overhaul all English or
foreign vessels plying in these waters.
Last week they went over the Monowai,
and their report reflects great credit upon
Chief Engineer M< Caig and his assistants.
The vessel's engines and boilers were
found to be in perfect order ana in a re
markably good state of preservation, so
there >vas no question about granting her
license. Now that the 'retards" nave
been tested there is a chance for Mcl'ai.
to show what the Monowai can do on the
run from here to Sydney.
The sealing schooner Eppinger, now in
Oakland Creek, ib going on another cruise.
When overhauled, Captain White will go

but later Alaskan waters will be tried.
Captain Fred Nelson, one of the best

The whaling bark Gay head is out of the
Arctic ice and on her way to Honolulu. At
tue latter piuce she will receive her mail
and will then go sperm-w ale hunting.
She will not return to ban Francisco until
next November.
The Amarapoora again broke away from
her moorings yesterday. This makes
three times since she has been at Lom

A DARK MYSTERY
IN CHINESE CRIME
Identity of the Man Mur
dered Last Monday
Now Learned.
He Was Suey Jack, Partner oi
Chun Sing, at 7292 Jack-
son Street
WO THEORIES ON THE DEED.
A Six Companies Detective Lays the
Cudgel on the Lax ty of Ameri
can Laws.
One of the most puzzling mysteries yet
recorded in the dark affinals of Chinese
crime in this State is the murder of one
of the owners of the vegetable garden on
Staten Island, in the San Joaquin River.
It is now ascertained that the real name
of the murdered man. is Suey Jack, part
ner with Chunking in a small merchan
dise establishment at 729% Jackson street.
This is in the basement, and is reached by
steps leading direct y from the sidewalk.
Chun Sing and Suey Jack were equal
owners of half of the vegetable gar
den on Staten Inland, the other part be
longing to (.'huii F>>w. Jack's purpose in
going to San Joaquin County was to have
a settlement of the proceeds of the vege
table garden industry between Chun Fow
and himself, he also acting for Chun Sing.
Then came the news of his murder, and
the mysterious element creeps in. It
would be a natural supposition that Jack
was murdered for the money he had col
lectpd lor himseif and his partner Sing, if
it were not for the lac that the mur :ertd
man's ear was shaven off ciose to his
bead. This is taken by the Chinese as
indicative of a desire on the part of the
murderer to secure evidence that he hacl
killed his man.
The only reason assignable for wishing
to secure such ev:dence is to prove to th
leaders of the highbinders in this City
that the act was committed by the pos
sessor in order to secuie b.ooJ money.
Sing says his partner has at no time
been concerned in any of the various
Chinatown feuds, though he is a member
of the Kung Chow Asylum, which has
been a hotbed of murder, of iate.
Jack was also a See f up. It is thought
in some quarters that he might have been
concerned in the overtures for peace made
with the Chinese Consul-General, but the
more thoughtful CbinÂ«-se reject this theory
on the ground that Jack was only a small
merchant and in such grave matters would
have bad absolutely no influence.
It was next door to 7-9>Â£ Jackson street
into which thi- murderers of the Cninese
druggist of Dupont street fle I and were
captured by Officer Freel some time ago.
Jack's murderer or murderers may have
thought that he gave information leading
to these men's detection, and so have been
actuated by motives of revenge.
Sau Chieg, one of the detectives of the
Chinese Six Companies or Consolidated
Benevolent Association, lays the whole
blame of the recent murders on the laxity
of American laws.
"In China," he said, "a man who kills
another is detected and executed in pretty
short order. Here a man can kill Presi
dent Cleveland and if he have money
enougb can with the aid of lawyers prove
himself insane, that he took the Presi
dent's life because ne thought him a cow
or horse.
"Take the case of Ock Wah, sent to
State prison for life for the murder of
Lee Ti at 34 Waverley place. Now it is a
fact well known in Chinatown that the
reÂ»l murderer is safe in China. If Ameri
cans have no respect for their own laws
they cannot consistently expect the most
degraded e.emeutot the Chinese to have."
Will of F. O. licoaroli.
The will of Francesco Giuseppl Piccaroll has
been filed for probate. The testator bequeaths
to Giuseppi ViganiÃO his gold watch and
chain and to Luigi Vipanigo his gold medal.
The residue of the estate, which is valued at
about $6500, is devised f> Vincenzo Ravenna
and Francesco Arata, to be held in trust for me
benelit of the decedent's daughters, Adelalda
Viganigo and Nina Ferrea, the estate to be di
vided among the children of said devisees on
their death. Mrs. L. Untemayer is to receive
$500 for serv ces rendered during the lasi sick
ness of the decedent.

Strangely enough it says that Leandei
Richaruson is to "manage him,'' thus aid
mc George Berieman, who lays distinciior
to at onetime having been connected Witt

Schrader and Berieman got out of San
Francisco in the niche of time. They were
careful readers of the papers and did not
tempt fate 100 far, though they must have
got several hundred dollars in toe brief
time they were here.
Tuey evidently at once put a lone dis
tance between themselves and the coast.

Schrader is ranked as a mountebank and
swindler.

It Will Be Held Next Tuenday After
noon and Kvnning.
The Welsh Ladies' Aid Society of San
Francisco are busily engaged in making
the arrangements for the holding of a
bazaar, supper and entertainment at the
Cambrian Hall, 1133 Mission street, next

The proceeds will go toward increasing
the building fund of the Welsh church
which is to be erected on Ridley Street.

which Professor Thomas Price, the well
known assayer, will preside. Rhys
Thomas of the Tivoli Opera-house (by

between 5 and 8 o'clock, and t'.ie sale of
useful and ornamental articles will in the
meantime go merrily on, interspersed with

DEATHS FROM
DREAD DIPHTHERIA
Six Reported at the Health
Office During Last
Month.
Thirty-Nine Cases Were Found
by the District In
spectors.
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS TAKEN.
A Large Number of Scarlatina and
Typhoid Cases Also Develop
About the City.
Considerable alarm is beginning to be
sit in the Health Department over the
inusual increase in the number of cases of
diphtheria reported during the past month,
and while it is denied that the dread dis
ease is epidemic, the fact remains tnat ex
traordinary precautions are being taken to
prevent its spread.
Strict orders have been issued to quaran
tine all authenticated cases, or even where
a strong suspicion exists the vigilance is
to be redoubled.
Since the present Board of Health went
into office there has been a steady decrease
in the number of cases reported and also
in the number of deaths until the past
thirty days, and the department is at a
loss to know why the scourge of the chil-
dren has so suddenly developed alarming
proportions again. The only good reason
that can be advanced is tn c weather,
which has been rather favora ble to the
development of the disease; but even this
hardly accounts for the large number of
cases.
The reports of the district inspectors,
which have just been made public in the
monthly report of the Health Department.
show that during the thirty days ending
November 1 there ware thirty-nine cases
reported, and tue records of the depart
ment show that six of these proved fatal â
an unusually large number for one month.
During the entire twelve months of last
year there were only nineteen deaths re
ported from diphthena.
Not one district of the eight into which
tho City is divided Is free from tne dis
ease, but the largest number made their
appearance in the Fourth District,of which
W. H. Duren >s the inspector. This dis
trict comprises the larger portion of the
Mission, and is bounded by Haight and
York and Eleventh streets and the San
Micuel rancho. Mr. Duren reported
twenty-three cases during November. The
majority occurred about the vicinity of
Church and Seventeenth streets, Channel
and Harrison streets, Valencia and Four
teenth streets and Castro and Seventeenth
streets.
In the Seventh District, which is under
the eya of G. S. Miliard, four cases oc
curred ; three cases in the Second Dis
trict, reported by Inspector Otto Luders:
three in the Sixth District, reported by
Inspector Stout; three in the Fifth, re
ported by Inspector Kinne, ani one in
each of the First, Third and Eighth dis
tricts.
Those m the Second District occurred
about the vicinity of California and Jones

STANTON WANTS
TO BE A MARTYR
Chafing Under the Legal
Fetters of the Circuit
Court.
Strong Talk of Defying the
Restraining Order of Judge
McEenna.
WILLING TO SE SENT TO JAIL.
Some Interesting Comparisons of
Grain Rates Submitted by the
Southern Pacific.
Dr. James I. Stanton, Railroad Commis
sioner of the State of California, young,
bold and impulsive, is chafing under the
legal fetters in which the commission is
bound by the temporary restraining order
issued by United States Circuit Judee Mc-
Xenna more than a year ago, and which
enjoins the commission from making any
changes in the rates of the Southern Pa
cific Company.
In fact Chairman La Rue is also fretting
over the state of innocuous desuetude into
which the commission has been placed,
but beins older and more conservative his
impatience is less manifest.
Commissioner Clark, however, preserves
his imperturbable attitude without any
apparent effort, and yesterday calmly and
with just a shade of interest listened to
the sensational, almost revolutionary,
tenor of the discussion of the situation by
his two colleagues.
It was before the commission had been
formally called to order that Dr. Stanton
suggested that everything ought to be
done by the commission to test the power
of the Circuit Court to effectually tie the
hands of the commission. He wanted tbe
commission to make a reduction in rates
despite the order of the court. His con
tention was that while the court might
restrain the commission from carrying
out any particular order it had established I
or published, it did not have the power to
anticipate and prevent any future action
of that body. He declared that lie was j
willing to risk being pronounced in con
tempt cf the court, and that lie was not
even averse to being sent to jail so long as
the rights of the people, as represented by
the commission, would be protected and
enforced.
While Chairman La Rue agree with his
colleague that it was a hardship on the
grain-shippers particularly and on all
merchants generally to have the powers
and status of the commission kept in un- !
certainty for so long a period of time, he '
said he did not see how the situation
cooid be cleared until the court rendered !
its decision in the pending case. To take '
any action now that might be construed
as contumacious, he said, miuht only :
prejudice the mind of Judge McKenna in |
connection with the case which he now !
iiad under consideration.
Dr. Stanton explained that he did not
desire to have any action taken for the
mere purpose of defying tbe Federal
Judge, but was only anxious to ascertain
in proper legal course just what the status
of the commission is. If it could be tied
up as it was now, he thought it might just
us well be abolished.
While this rather exciting exchange
going on Commissioner Clark simply list
ened, grinned a bit. listened and grinnea.
"When Chairman La Rue called for order
routine business was at once taken up,
and the matter of testing the Federal ju
dicial power over the commission was not
even referred to.
The first communication read was a
brief self-explanatory note from C. F.
Smurr, general freight agent of the South
ern Pacific Company, to which was at
tached a long series of tabulated figures
indicating from the amount of labor in
volved in its preparation an earnest and
sincere desire on the part of the railroad
to make amends for its 1-don't-want-to
play-in-your-yard policy of the past year.
The epistle was as follows :
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 11, 189 G.
Samuel Xewtnan, Secretary of the State Board of
Railroad Comwissjone?*â dear Sir: In com
piiauce with your verbal request of yesterday
I take pleasure in handing you herewith a
statement showing rates on grain in carloads
current September 17, 1895, compared with
rates named iv the Commissioners' tariff of
same date and rates current November 9
1890, between points in territory covered by
your memorandum.
The statement inclosed with the note
shows some significant comparisons in a
manner never presented, and which are
additionally inteiesting in view of the
source whence they come. A few of these
comparisons are here given:

BErWEEN-
While tbe Commissioners' tariff con
templated only an & per cent reduction on
the rates of September 19, 1895, many of
tiie reductions made by the Southern
Pacific Company represent a cut of 33 per
cent. This was the direct result of the
advent of the Valley road.
The statement also presented fieures
from the various points mentioned to
Sacramento and Marysville, but these
showed no changes in the charges of the
Southern Pacific Company as they existed
a year ago.
This communication and attached state
ment were ordered filed after the Commis
sioners decided to incorporate them in
their report.
The \ alley road schedule of passenger
rates was approVed, and a communication
was read from J. E. Isaacs, an attorney of
Redding, Cal., asking if the commission
had jurisdiction over the Mountain Mines
Jiaihoad of Shasta County, as he desired
to file a complaint against the road.
Secretary Newman informed the board
that he had replied stating that the board
had jurisdiction. Several bills were ap
proved, and then the commission ad
journed.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1896.
SIX HOT ROUNDS
IN SAUSALITO
Bob Fitzsimmons and His
Partner Hickey Have
a Set-to.
Several Invited Guests Wit
nessed the First Practice
Bout.
A NOVEL BCX[NG CEILING.
The Great Fight?r Says That Three
Weeks', Training Is All He Will
Require for the Sailor.
Bob Fitzsimmons, tho famous pugilist,
has settled down to a hard course of train
ing in Sausalito. The snug little cottage
in which he and his family are domiciled
is situated on the hillside immediately
overlooking the handsome and aristo
cratic quarters of the Pacific Yacht (Jlub.
The officers of the club have tendered
the pugilist the use of the club and
grounds'while he is located at Sausalito.
When seen yesterday afternoon by a
Call representative the champion was en
gaged in the apparently pleasant task of
erecting a ceiling for his punching- bag in
the boatnou?e by the sea. After complet
ing his job iiob entered into conversation
with his friends who had journeyed from
this City to see how he was getting along
in his new quarters.
"You are looking well, Bob," said one of
the boys, who appeared to take a great in
terest in the New Zealander.
" Yes," quickly replied Fitz, "and I feel
just as well as I Jook, but you see I must
knuckle down to business, as I have only
three weeks in which to get ready for
Fitzsimmons and Trainer Hickey at Work in the Quarters at
* Sausalito.
those awful smashes I expect to receive
from the sailor champion when we meet
in the ring.
"The last time I fought in this City I
trained at old Barney Farley's. I had just
two weeks to get into trim for my match
with Billy McCarthy. Although I was
not by any means perfect wi.en 1 faced
my opponent, I was perfect enough for
the tight I expected io have. I will take
three weeks for the sailor. I think that
will do me or else I am greatly mistaken
in my man. 1 know the sailor i's as strong
as a lighting bull, but that don't cut any
ice with me. I think I can stop him.
"I have had dealing* with rushers dur
inp my time and I managed to stop them
before they got too gay. But this sailor
may be the wonder of the ace for all I
know. Well, we shall wait and see what
kind of stuff he is made of."
Fitz'imiuons was feeling a bit stiff in
his nether limbs yesterday. He bad taken
an early morning spin over several mile 3
of country and felt sore in the muscles of
his thighs, but he expects to work the
stiffness out in a day or two.
Not having the bag-punchine apparatus
exactly completed for business be did not
give those present an opportunity of see
ing him punching the leather oval, but a
six-round boxing bout with his sparring
partner, Dan Ilickey, satisfied those who
witnessed the set-to that -'Fitz" ij as
speedy as ever with his "dukes," and can
administer an awful blow when the occa
sion demands a li tie extra force in the
delivery of knockout goods.
During the latter part of the exhibition
Bpb started in to josa bis sparring part
utr in a good-natured manner.
"So you are the champion sailor who is
going to knock Fitz into a cocked hat, are
you?" queried the big fellow, as he
"struck' 1 a rigoting attitude and dashed
at Ilickey, who quickly stepped to one
side and missed catching a right-hand
punch that would have made him feel
anything but pleasant.
Hickey, who is a very clever exponent
of the manly art, is but a cfiild in the
hands of lanky Fits) The big New Zea
lander, who by the way is now a full
fledged American citizen, will engage the
services of one of the heavy scrappers
about town next week. He does not pro
pose to engage in any severe exerciso this
week, but during the second and last
weeks of his training he will go right at
his men, and it goes without saying that
the pug lists who will have to take their
medicine daily in the shape of punches
will well earn their salaries.
Martin Julian, who is Fitzsimmons
manager and adviser, is a very unassum
ing and pleasant fellow, who will make
many friends among the sporting frater
nity. He said in reference to the lighter's
method of training that he rises at 7 a. x.
and then takes a spin over the roads, re
turning in time for breakfast at 8 a. m.
During the day bag-punching, sparring,
boat-rowing swimming, etc., will Â«orra the
principal training which Fitzsimmons will
indulge iv during his sojouru in sunny
Sausalito.
Julian said that he expect*, to have the
new boxing ceilingâ which at first sight
resembles a wheel of fortune â in its place
by Saturday.
This new- nnd decidedly novel arrange
ment was made in the East specially for
the great fighter. When in position flags
of all nations can be placed around the
edpe of this unique structure. A shield,
with the American colors, is also a pan
of this highly prized so-called boxing
ceiling.
George Miebling, the wrestling instructor
of the Olympic Club, and wife were among
the interested spectators who witnessed
the boxing bout between Fitzsimmons
and Hickey. Miehiing is confident that
Sharkey will be stopped in lour rounds or
less.
A number of the members of the Pacific
Yacht Club and invited guests will see
Lanky Bob go throngh a bag-punchinc
performance on Saturday afternoon. No
doubt they will be astonished at his mar
velous quickness.
SALVATION ARMY FARM.
It Will Be Dedicated by Briffadier
Keppel Xext Sunday.
The Salvation Army's Knights of Hope
Farm, a quiet place of refuse for the
poor and the outcast, situated in the hills
near Martinez, will be dedicated next Sun
day. Brigadier Keppel and staff and
Adjutant and Mrs. McFee and staff will
preside.
This farm is for the purpose of giving
friendless men. discharged from prison, a
temporary home and employment, until
permanent positions can be found for
them. The farm will also take tirst of
fenders when the Judges will allow tnem
to be sent to the Salvation Army
instead of sending them to jail to be
branded as iailbirds and convicts. The
Salvationists are confident that in many
cases reform can be better accomplished
outside than inside of a prisdn, and they
will do all in their power to prove that
such is the case. *

CHARTER AND PRIMARIES
Resolutions Adopted by the
Democratic County Com
mittee.
A Nirw Primary Election Law to Bj
Suggested to the Naxt Legis
lature
W. P. Sullivan presided at a meeting of
the Democratic Connty Committ c last
evening in room 17, Flood- building, and
introduced the rollowing resolution, which
was adopted unanimously:
Wherkas, This committee has at all times
promised to the Democratic Darty that it
would use all He influence and efforts with the
Democrats who might be elected to otlice in
tola Uty to obtuln irora them for this com
rnittcc the right and privilege of distributing
fairly among the active Democrats of the
party 111 earn of the eighteen Assembly dis
tricts the patronuge of the respective offices
to which the Democrats should be elected; and
whereas, the party has succeeded at the last
election in electing many Democrats to office,
having under their control large and valuable
patronage; therefore be It
Jiwlrrd, That all the Democrats elected as
aforesaid be at once officially communicated
with by the secretary, requesting them to In
form this committee in writing on or befora
Monday, th? U'Ja .lay of November. 1890. what
part or portion oi the patronage of their re
spective offices they will tender to this cdbi
niiuee or the general committee of the
eighteen Assembly districts for distribution to
said districts among ihe active and worthy
Democrats of the party.
The following, introduced by M. C. Has
sett, was also adopted:
Whereas, a vast majority of our citizens
are in tavor of the adoption ot a new charter
for the government of this City as soon as it
can be iramed and passed upon by the voters
and connrmed by the Legislature; therefore,
be it
Jietohrd, That the campaign committee of
the Democratic party eonier with the Republi
can Conntv Committee and other political
organizations with a view of agreeing, if pos
sible, upon one set of freeholders to be voted
for to frame a charter.
Resolved, Further, that a committee of three
be appointed by the chair to present these
resolutions to the Kiection Commissioners and
request them to call a special election as soon
after July 1 1807. as practicnble for the elec
tion of freehblaers to frame a charter.
Mr. Hassett also introduced the follow
ing, which was adopted:
Whereas, The different political parties have
grea; reason to congratulate themselves and
the public generally 011 the practically fair
election lately held in this City; ana whereas,
it is generally conceded that The chief source
of all the evils fastened on our political li:e is
mainly due to the want of an election law
llere L he wlll of the People can be expressed
through the ballot at primary elections; there
lorÂ« be it r
Rexol-td. That the chairman of this commit
tee appoint a committee of rive to confer with
tj, him liar commltieo of other political organi
zations for the purpose of framing a primary
election law to be presented to the next Legis
lature providing for the election of county
committees for all oolitical parties at the next
general election. *
THEY FOUND A
HUGE MARE`S NEST
Detectives Dig Up an Old
Story in the Fair
Will Case.
They Will Shew That the Sen
ator Was Not in Two
Piaces at Ones
! WHEN WRITING A PENCIL WILL
Claim That H? Was in San Rafael,
Wfcen, According to Testimony,
He Was Here.
A huge mare's nest lias been dug ud in
San Rafael by I. W,. Lees, captain of the
police detectives of this City, and Police
Detective Seymour, in connection with
the Fair will case. The nest, however, is
not a new one. It was stirred up last
summer. The only interesting feature
about it is that Captain Lees and one of
his men should have gone into the coun-
t r y on a private case.
According to the story of the detectives
discovery in San Rafael Senator Fair could
not have been in San Francisco on the
aft rr oon of September 24, 1894, on which
day it is claimed he made the pencil will.
A tedious and mazy narrative with some
incidents to freshen the memory of one
man â J. J. Schneider, a cigar-dealer of
San Rafael â is woven. Of courso there are
others who claimed with much solemnity
that they recollected having seen the late
Senator Fair in San Rafael "some time in
September, 1894." And it is further
averred that Mr. Fair's signature appeals
on tbe register of the Parisian House of
that town September 24, 1894. The con
clusion was that Senator Fair was in San
Rafael that day; and also as he drove to
Bt. Vincent's Asylum on tbe same day he
could not have been in San, Francisco.
September 24, 1X94, is the day on which
the late Senator Fair, accordine to the
testimony of two witnesses in rotirt, exe
cuted the pencil will in this City. Tbe
point ol the story is that the Senator could
not have been here then.
From the office of Delmas * Shortridge
a statement was issued yesterday in reply
to the San Rafael yarn, as follows:
"There is no feeling of surprise at this
tale. The whole story was in our posses
sion for months. It is a rood deal like the
narrative published in June, when the
Elliotts stated they would testify
that Miss Elliott had heard on
the afternoon of the 25th or Septem
ber, 1594, a certain conversation
behind the curtains in Senator Fair's
apartments in the Lick House, and tnat
the date was identified by them next day
by a letter sent to Los Angeles and re
turned to them. Then the attorneys lor
Charles Fair said that this positiveVtory
would be corroborated by tne same valet
who is now said to vouch for tne new
story that Senator Fair was in Nan Rafael
on that day. Furthermore they then said
that this valet would show that Senator
Lair was ill in tho Lice House on Septem
ber 24.
"All we have to say is that at the proper
time we will prove that the pencil will
was written at the time and place already
stated under oath by two witnesses, and
that we are quite assured of onr position
in the matter, as Messrs. Reuben H.
Lloyd, Ru- sell Wilson, Charles Wheeler,
George A. Knight, Charles A. Heggerty
and Charles li. Fair, Mrs. Oelrichs and her
husband. Miss Virginia Fair ana Richard
I)ey. when they stated in many interviews
in the newspapers, aud solemnly in open
court, and in various petitions addressed
to the court, were acquainted with the
writing, and the facts connected with
the making of the will, when they
vouched for the genuineness of the pencil
will. We consider the San Rafael story a
mare's nest.
"It has already been testified by two
witnesses under oath with regard to the
making of the will, and while it is gen
erally believed that one of these is inter
ested in the will this is a general miscon
ception. Mrs. Craven is not even men
tioned in the will, so her testimony is not
colored by acy interest she may have un
der it."
WAITED FOR THE MOON
The Siberian King Koharie
Parleyed With Traveler
De Windt.
Hi Would Not Furnish Dog Trains.
Impossible to Cross Till April
Anyway.
Harry 'de Windt, the London journalist
and author, who was in San Francisco
last March-, and who set out to cross in
terior Alaska and Siberia on foot, arrived
here yesterday and is at the Palace.
Mr. e'e Windt'a first idea was to walk
from New York to Paris, crossing Bering
Straits on the ice, but hia itinerary
on further thought underwent some
changes. He proceeded from the coast of
Alaska across the straits to Siberia in a
wna)er. He brought up at Indian Point,
a lonely place in the Siberian wilds.
There he and W. U. Harding, his valet
were set down. They had expected to out
lit at that point with dog trains and proced
over the snowy wastes as far as possible^
and finally, by book or crook, to reach St.
Petersburg.
When they reached Indian Point they
met the Indian king Koharie, iind at once
began to negotiate with him for some of
his men as well as th Â« dog trains. They
had taken many trinke?F, suct> as Mr. de
Windt supposed would allure the savages.
These they began to display among the
Indians, and not without effect as seem-d
for a time.
Still Koharie put off the time for start
ing. He claimed the moon was not ri^ht
for the expedition. Mr. de Windt waited
and waited, only to find that the bronzed
ruler of the tribe wanted to put off the
time. It was a nard place to stay.
Mr. de Windt had to live on whale
blubber and seal meat, and it wss getting i
monotonous. He was getting no satisfac
tion from Koharie, and linally ascertaining
that it was the wrong season, and that the
best time for the trip was in April, he gave
it up.
He still believes, however, that the trip
could be successiully made.
While absent on the > rim Siberian coast
the gentleman had a hard time. In ad
dition to the rough fare he lived in a smoky
hut. where every hour seemed to increase
the discomfort. The whaler Belvidere,
which had been icebound for two years,
finally got in shape so she could return,
and Mr. de Windt cast his fortunes with
her aud reached this country again.
As originally outlined the trip would
have cost Mr. de Windt about ?25,000. He
has spent a large sum since leaving Paris
as it IS, but does not regret it, as he has
obtained a great deal of information in
regard to the natives of Alaska and
Siberia.

OWNS OPAL MINES.
â¢John Fender on the Subgidence of the
Great J'ooin Which Reigned
in Australia.
John Fender of Melbourne, Australia,
who owns interests in the opal mines of
(Queensland, is at the Lick. He is a lead
ing manufacturer of Melbourne and a rela
tive of Sir John Fender.
Mr. Tender has been on a visit tc New
York and other cities. He carried with
him quite a quantity 0* opals, and got for
one piece from Tiffany $100.
"The opals of Australia," He said last
night, "are now admitted to be the finest
in the worid. Our opal mines are in both
New South Wales and Queensland. The
Tiffanys informed me tnat tho piece of
stone which i sold them was of exceptional
value and beauty."
Talking of the boom that not long aince
existed in Australia, be said:
"There was an awful collapse after the
boom. Froperty went down to one-tenth
of its previous value. It got finally that
there was not a buyer for any, no matter
how loÂ°v it sold.
"I think t&e reason everybody went
speculating in the first place was because
Miere was so much English money that
came for investment. If a man had a con
tract even, for a piece of property, he
could go to any bank and get all the
money he wanted.
"But we are afraid of booms now, and
don't want any more of them. We never
want to see any, helievinjj as we do that
no good can ever come of any of them.
Business is now stiffening up, and we are
satisfied."
Mr. Pender will Jeave to-day on the
Monowai for home.

postage stamps on letters he sent to friends

to pay a fine 01 .SIOO, which he was very glad
to do under the circumstances. For the sake
ot saving Ã¼boul 30 cents he had run the risk of
being imprisoned for six months and paying
$"â¢00 en each charge. As it was, his postage
stamp bill cost hin: dearly. De Blaumford

Testimony to Show That the Pris-
cner Was Mentally Unbalance!.
Martin's Vile Words.
Mrs. Susie B. Martin, who shot and
killed her husband, John F. Martin, on
tne morning of the 30th of last March in
front of the office of the Chief of Police, in
tne new City Hall, is on trial for murder
in Judge Wallace's department of the
Superior Court.
. Mrs. Martin appeared in court yester
'iay, accompanied by half a dozen lady
friends. Sne was dressed in black and
wore an expression of extreme dejection.
-. She is 33 years of age and looks much
.-o)der.
â¢ Etta McDermott was the first witness
examined yesterday morning. She saw a
â¢man and woman walking through the
corridor near the office of the Chief of
Police, but was not able to positively iden
tify the defendant. A few moments later
she heard the pistol-shots and saw tbe
officers arrest the woman.
Police Officer D. M. Egan testified to
' the first shot fired by Mrs. Mar
tin. He at once started toward her and
saw her fire two additional shots. She
.was arrested at once and her pistol was
taken from her. Officer Egan identified a
big bulldog pistol as the instrument of
death.
Attorney Fred Frey testified that he saw
the shooting of Jack Martin by Mrs. Mar
tin. He was walking to the Police Court
wjien he heard a conversation between
/Mr, and Mrs. Martin. He heard her say,
"Jack, I'm hungry; I'm starving.'' Mar
tin's reply was, "Go to , you ."'
â¢= He turned as if to leave her and she shoe
.him. He screamed and fell. Then she
â¢ fired two more shots. He wa3 lying on
his side when the two last shots were fired.
.In reply to the cross-questioning of At
torney Carroll Cook, representing the de
fense, Mr. Frey said he did rot hear Mar
â  â¢ tin tell his wife to go and work for a living,
with the addition of a vulgar phrase.
Officer Charles Crockett said ho took
â¢ Mrs. Martin's pistol from her and con
aucted her to the prison in the basement
of the City Hall.
Oathe way to the prison she cried out,
"'Did I shoot him?" When told that she
had accomplished l.er object, she s>aiil,
. "He drovf me to it. I had nothing in the
house to eat. He ha\i not been home for
three nights."
In reply to Attorney Cook the witness
said that when Mrs. Martin was doing the j
shooting sne was vory pale, and after her j
arrest appeared hysterical. After beiiii; >
taken to tie prison sne kept taiKing about j
how much she loved Martin.
Lir. Fitzsibbons o f the Receiving Hos- i
pital testified in regard to the wounds and '
ueatn of Martin, and the prosecution, iiav- i
â¢ ing occupied forty-three minutes, closed
" its case, reserving tbe privilege of intro
ducing later tbe testimony of Dr. Barrtstt,
â¢ who performed the autopsy.
Attorney Henry I. Kowaisky made the j
opening statement for the defense. He
, said that they expected to r>rovo by the
history of the delendant and her family
that she is predisposed to unsoundness of I
mind, and that at tlie iime of the shoot- j
ing sue was not responsible, but was in I
. fact temporarily insane: that her mother
Â« by her friends and acquaintances con
sidered not to be in her right mind; that I
two of her male relative* have been con- j
fined in insane asylums. Giving the bis- i
toryof tbe defendant, Mr. Kowaisky sÂ»aid !
that she was married at 16, and her fir-t I
husband died, after which sh<! married an {
â¢actor named Hill, from whom sde ob
tained a divorce. Coming to fc-an Fran
cisco she met and married John F. Mar
tin, who treated her with great cruelty.
He wouid stay away from home at a week
â  at a time, and for months refused to con
tribute a cent for the support of the fam
ily. Tradesmen were ringing the door- I
Lc-11 constantly and demanding th6ir i
money, but there was not a cent in the i
house, and she was driven frantic. All j
thi" time Martin was earning from $90 to j
$150 a month, an 1 was spending his
â¢inoivey with other women, Ms habits
being so notorious that they wer â¢ the talk '
of tue neighborhood, and were known to
bis wile as well as looihers; that when
she appealed to her husband for means oi
support lie to";d her to go and earn what
she. needed by leading an immoral life.
She cried ou", "John, you don't mean
that," and he replied, "Yes, I do; better
women than you have done that."
Mr. Kcwalsky said that in addition to !
earning a good salary Martin had received I
$800 on uccount of a corrupt bargain, but j
â¢ tbat even then he wouid not give his wile j
'a cent for her support. He would ask for |
' an acquittal on the ground of insanity.
.. Attorney Benjamin Napthalv was the
first witness for the defense. . He said:
"I was in the corridor of the new City
Kail on the morning of the s ooiing and
taw a woman walking up and down in a
nervous way. John Martin came in and I
said, 'Hello, Jack,' for I had known him
for years.
*:The lady approached Martin and be
gan to talk. Siie appeared very much ex
rited. Suddenly she t*gan to shoot and I '
jammed into a doorway to get out of
range, liie next thing I saw Martin was
lying on the floor."
He corroborated what Mr. Kowaisky
had said in his opening statement of tbe
conversation wiiich had preceded the
shooting.
Mrs. Fannie A. Foster, wife of Ned
Foster, and sister of the prisoner, testified
that she bad always considered her sister,
â Mrs. Martin, exceedingly hysterical and
somewhat disturbed in her mental condi
â¢ tion. Her mother, Mrs. Lydia Virgi . she
said, is of a moody disposition, in affl-.cted
with insomnia, nervous prostration and
recently has stiffere i from a stroke of
paralysis that affects the right side of tier
face. Mrs. Foster said the granduncle of i
herself and the prisoner, named benjamin
P. Stitt, died in an insane asylum, and her
uncJe, Caleb Ratto, was confined in an
insan-e asylum in Kentucky and also at j
Stockton, California.
Mrs. Susan M usance, a foster sister of
â¢Martin, the man who was killed, testified
to tbe excited and hysterical condition of
Mrs. Martin on tbe day before she shot
her husband.
Captain J. J. Callunden of Morse's
patrol said be often saw Martin and Mrs.
Martin in tbe year before the killing, as
I they lived only across the street from his
| otlice. He frequently saw Martin going

V' d Mrs. Martin called to tell him that
her husband would not give her any
money. She seemed to be much dis

Jerome Deasy testified that he and his
wife resided in the flat just below the floor
occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Martin. He

FIVE THOUSAND SHARES.
Spring Taller Stock Readily Taken at

The Spring Valley Water Works, need
ing a half million dollars to meet obliga
tions on account of construction, decided
to put out 5000 shares of the reserve stock.
Bids were solicited and the new shares is
sued were taken at an average of $U7 20
Der share.
Some of the brokers fancied that the
extra issue would diminish the value of
the stock in tbe market and conducted
transactions on that theory. They were
disappointed in their calculations. The
stock went out at tne time that money
was being withdrawn from safe-deposit
boxes for investment in interest-paying

were readily accepted as a good invest
ment for idle money.

BRUTALLY BEATEN

The Way Charles Peterson
Punished His Step
son.
He Is Arrested for Cruelty to
Children and Bat*
tery.
CASE OP EXTREME CEUfLTY.
The Eoy's Shoulders ani Back Are
Cov.rcd With Stripes and His
Lelt Eye Badly Swo len.
One of the worst cases of cruelty to a
child that has come under the notice of
the Pacific Coast Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children was reported
yesterday.
Charles Peterson, a sailor, lived on Polk
lam. 1 , off Stockton street, with his wife and
stepson, Frank Angsberger, a bright boy
9 year* of acre. The couple were married
about six years ago shortly after the death
ot Frank's father and since then they have
led a cat-and-dog life. Peterson used to
beat her ana also vent his anger upon the
boy.
Sunday night Peterson was in an ugly
mood. His wife had a pair of black eyes
which he gave her a few nights before and
he proceeded to inflict more corporal pun
ishment upon her.
The boy was in bed, and Peterson made
him up. As soon as the little fellow
stood before him Peterson grabbed hold of
him and threw him against the wall. As
the boy lay stunned upon the floor Peter
son tooK a thick piece of rope and used it
unmercifully upon the poor boy. He
brougnt it down repeatedly upon his
shoulders and back, and one blow struck
him in the left eye and nearly knocked it
out.
The boy's screams alarmed the neigh
bors and made Peterson desist. With a
brutal kick he told the boy to get back to
bed and "shut hia mouth. 1 '
YestÂ«rdav morning Peterson removed
from Poik lane to Dunne alley, off Kearny
street, and as soon as he had none some of
the neighbors notified the society. Officer
T. J. Coleman went to Dunne alley, where
he found Peterson and placed him under
arrest. He was taken to the Californin
street station, and charees of cruelty to
children and battery were booited against
him. The piece of rope wns booked as
evidence.
Officer Coleman took the boy to the Re
ceiving Hospital. His left eye was badly
swollen and inflamed, and his shoulders
and back were covered with a mass of
black and yellow stripes where the rope
bad fallen.
Dr. Fazgibbon dressed the injured eye
and attended to the contusions on the
boy's shoulders and back. Later Officer
Coleman tooK the boy to the Youths' Di
rectory, where he will be kept.
Frank was aske i if he had done any
thing to mate Peierson beat him, and he

in bed and after he beat mother he made
me get up and threw me auainst the wull.
Then he got the rope and beat me so hard
that I thought I would die. He has often
beaten me before."
Peterson bad only been Iranferred to
the City Prison for a few minutes, when
two attorneys secured his release on two
bonds oi $1200 each, accepted by Clerk Sul
livan of Judge Low's court.
This is not the first time Peterson has
been in trouble. Five years ago he was
sentenced to San Quentin for a year for
assault with a deadly weapon. He was
being arrested by Policeman Henneberry,
when he broke the officer's arm with a club.
A MIDNIGHT RIDE.
Boys Steal Horses From a Barn and
One of Them Is Arrested for
Burglary.
Mark Kelly, a boy, was arrested early
on Tuesday morning by Policeman A. B.
Riebl on the charges of grand larceny and
burglary.
Monday night KÂ«Â»lly and three other
boys broke into the barns of James Mar
shall, Twelfth an>l Harrison streets, and
took out four horses. They rode the
norses to the Cliff House and enjoyed
themselves for several hours riding along
the beach.
The burglary had been discovered and
tbe police were notified. Kiehl saw the
boys riding alona Mission street about 3
o'clock In the morning on their way back
to the barns. He arrested Kelly, but the
three others escaped.
Kelly was taken before Judge Low yes
terday morning. The Judge, after hear
ing Riehi's testimony, thought that the
boy should only be charged with a mis
d- meanor, as he was in the act of return
ing the horses when arrested. He, how
ever, continued the case till to-day, when
he will give his dtcision.
Kelly is a young hoodlum and spends
his time hanging around stables in the
Mission district.

An interesting lecture on mines and
mining was given by Major Andrew G.
Myers of Siskiyou County in Odd Fellows'
Hall. His address was illustrated by a
large number of stereoptican views show
ing me rupged hiiis of the northern
county where gold is extracted by
hyraulic process from the placers. The
moat interesting, however, were a collec
tion of flashlight pictures taken de p in
the interior of shafts and tunnels. A poodly
number of mining men were in the audi
ence.
Major Myers began his address by a
brief description of gold mining by the
ancients and he read extracts from an
cient writers to sbow that in many in
stances the gold mining operations of
thousands of years ago were very similar
to those of the present day.
Leaving tne ancients', Major Myers
came bacir. to "Siskiyou and the present !
day. He caused to be thrown upoa the
canvas on the stage pictures taken by I
fiashli ht far down in some of the mines â 
of Siskiyou. which showed the quartz '

I tunnel he had been able io pick up a ledge
I that bad "pinched out" and was lost to
the miners, who were driving ahead to no
purpose. After close investigation of the
premises ana the exteriorof the mountain
he decided that an earthquake had tie
| pressed a portion of tne mountain and
I cut the ledge in two, dropping one part
I considerably below the part that was
; being worked. The camera revealed the
. seam where the rupture had occurred.
The speaker asserted that the camera and
flashlight will .-oon be an important factor
! in this kind of mining.
A number of pictures were thrown upon

in the formation of gold quartz ledgfS,
and how easy ?t is for t c miner to be led

OATS SCARCE: UP NORTH.
The Tacoma Ledger of November 7 says: "The
great demand for Puget Sound oats has so lessened
the supply that home dealers are importing large
quantities of corn from lowa, Kansas, Nebraska
and other Middle Western States for feed purposes.
Eastern corn has been imported here before for
the same purpose, but not in such heavy quanti
ties, several local firms have a common shipment
of 100 tons of corn en route to the city. Corn ii
worth from $21 to t'2'l a ton. Oats are from $22
to $23. They cost the wholesalers about S2O a ton
at the farms. Within the last twenty-rive days
tORS nave jumped in price from $10 at the farm.
â Dealers say that they expect to begin the importa
tion of oats from the East when the price advances
$1 60 or $2 more a ton. The Northern Pacific, an
ticipating this action. has issued a â  new
tariff, taking effect November 5, . making a,
rate of 60 cents a 100 pounds on oats,
carloads of 30,000 pounds or over, from Wadfna
Minn., and points west to Portland, aroma
and Seattle. It is expected that this rate will en
able growers in Minnesota and North Dakota to
send oats to this territory. Native oats are con
sidered by many the bÂ«-st grown in the Untied
States for nulling purposes. They are full and
plump In the berry and make the best cf cereal
flakes. 'They weigh from 36 to 40 pound* a bushel.
It is estimated there are 300,000 bushes of outs
yet in I lie Sound country anil that '.'50. 000 bushels
have be-n sold this season, n large part going to
San Francisco from Anacortes. the oat shipping
renter of the lower sound. Farmers In Eastern
Washington found little market for oats last year,
when they bi ought from $12 to $16 a ton, b-eanse
in- Sound supplied the demand in this part of the
Slate, both for fee.t aid milling purposes. They
could DOt compete with Western â¢ Washington
raisers, because of Intermediate charge?, and be
coming discouraged cave U|> oat raising this year.
Now the prospects are that farmers thousands of
mi .-s easy of them will find a market for their
01i.5."

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flgnraa
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In Inches and hundredths.
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means hlzh barometric pressure and
Is ally accompanied by fair weather: "loir"
refers to low pressure, and is u^nMly preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear, on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Improb
able. With a "high" in i he vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coas*. warmer
weather -may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. â  The reverse ot these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

rrw YORK. N. V., Nov. .11.â The security
markets were less active to-day, the sales of stocks
fcotlni; up 316,905 shares of way and miscel
laneous bonds, (2,414,000. As compared with
prev.ous days of the week both totals show a fall-
Ing off. The tendency of : prices was downward,
but the decline was stubbornly contested through
out. As of late the selling was mainly for profes
sionals who are working for a reaction, although
here and there In the lists sal.-s to realize profits
were noted. In view of me advance of late these
sales excite liitis or no comment. At the start
lower cable* from London and the poor showing
of St. Paul for the first week of November had an
advance in Itself.
Prlcesjbroke 31,4 percent for Manhattan to 100 Vi
and the general market ran off , WsiU/s per cent,
stitnr being the most prominent. The break in
.>. anna: Utn wnsdue to the disappointment felt in
certain quarters over the annual election. It was
expected that the new board would contain at
leastone repress nu-ive .of a. leading life Insur
ance company, but this piovlng not to be the case
recent buyers turned Kellers. Toward midday the
mnrket assumed a firmer tone and commission
houses reported an increase in outside order*, the
resu.t of the successful negotiation, of the Venezu
elan treaty.' - â . .- i â 
, As the day. wore alone the hears became, more
aggressive and an unfounded rumor of me d ath
of Cornelius Vanderbllt wat used with some effect.
Sugar, the Urancers, Louisville and .Nashville,
Western Union, Tennessee Coal, Southern Kail
way pfd. and Northern Pacific pfd. were especially
weak. Considering the efforts put forth the de
cline in prlct s Â»as unimportant. The fact of the
matter Is that the feeling is decidedly confident as
to the future and slocks are finding ready buyers
at each concession. Confidence was stimulated
by the declaration of the usual dividend by the
Burlington and Quincy, the action of the. bitumin
ous coal curriets of the Ohio Valley In form a
traffic association for three years, the increasing
ease in money and the successful placing- of thÂ«
New York City loan. ; These . bonds were awarded
on a bails which returns an annual income 01 3.2
per < cut. Already sales have been made to private
investors at an advance. . â 
In ;iie laic dealings susar declined to 121. The
company at the opening or business announced an
p.dvnnce of i/ 8 per cent in refined suzar but later
a reduction of equal proportion* was made. Man
hattan after breakl ig to lOJ'i rallied to lO^Vs
and rectded to :Oo^4@lol. speculation closi-i
weak. Net changes bhonel losses or 'i(aU per
cent outside of .Manhattan, which fell " Va percent.
Tobacco was In demand and rose to 8-6/ 8 on an
unfounded report of a settlement of the rate war
with the Western plug manufacturers.
Bonds were weak, In sympathy with the stock
market. Sales footed up $2,414,000. Urookltn

CHICAGO MAURIS
rpiono. i t.. Nov. 11. âLiverpool cables
controlled the action of the wheat market here to
â¢ day. The first advices from that place were Ir
i regular, but in a general way were unsatisfactory,
I as they failed to fully reflect the strength dis
played by American markets yesterday. Second
o.ies were decidedly adverse In that they were
from y2y 2 to iy 2 lower. There was plenty of wheat
for saie under these ' circumstances, and the de
mand was tempered by the evident easing of the
bullLh feeling. BeceiDts were light, Chicago hav
ing but 40 cars. The Northwest received 411 cars
against 118*-: on tne corresponding day a year ago.
Local Inspections fr.m store amounted to 69,683
I bushels. . . â¢
The session was marked by repeated changes in
I the sentiment, but the tendency to decline pre
| dominated and at the close almost Inside prices of
I the day were quoted. Kxport clearances amounted
i to 324.262 bushels. C.osins Continental nobles
were nlgiur. Decniib-r wheat opened from 801'ic
to 7934 c, sold betÂ«e#i. 80Â»ic and 783/ic closing a'

10-morioA- 57 cars. No. 2 rÂ«-<l %pot wneat ranged
nominally from Bi3^c 10 88Â»/ 4 c and closed at
about BttcÃ7c.
â¢ CoÃNâ it was easy to imagine how corn would
act with wheat weaker at.i! there being no encour
agement In the position of toe market in Itself.
Prices slipped away -without much demonstra
tion, although there was some selling by the bears.'
! Commission houses had ord on thai bide and
the only buyerj were "jhorts" Receipts were re
j murkily small, only 94 cars arrlv.ng, while
I 711 bushes were taken from store. Liverpool
cables were qno-.t-d higher. Export clearai
I amounted to 301.278 bushels. May corn opened
[ from .9VzC to 291/ ie, declined' to 29c. closing at
; the insideâ 6^jas/ic under yesterday. Estimated
1 receipts for to-morrow. 118 cars. '-
j OATSâ Received .heir share of weakness from
I the toppy conditions of wheat. The feeling In the
1 market was not la the least li dependent and
i trane Â«-Â»i moderate. Receipts were 130 can, and
' 7115" bushels were token from store. May oats

BIG SUE PRISE FOR VISITORS.
In a S questered Part of a Wild
Canyon Louis Leberer Builds
Wonderful Machines.
Oakland Office Max Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 11. j
On a ranch in Palomares Canyon, about
six miles beyond Haywards, lives ihe
most remarkable combination of plow
boy, mechanic and electrician that is to
be found in the land.
During the past few days stories have
reached Oakland of tbe wonderful achieve
ments of Louis Leberer, and to-day a
party went to his father's ranch to inspect
the boy's work. They found even more
than they had been led to believe. The
iad is a natural mechanic and inventor.
Younor Leberer escorted the visitors
around the ranch, first leading the way to
an engine built on a heavy wooden franc.
It is designed to be operated with either
water-power or electricity. The cylinder,
piston and all the attachments are of the
crudest pattern, but when the lad at
tached a primitive leather band to some
wheels and touched a rough handle, the
machine started to work with great speed
and evenness.
In one place grapes were being run
throuch a crusher, in another a churn
was making butter, another attachment
rolled corn, and another turned a boring
machine, which drilled Holes in iron
plates.
. Leberer then turned off the water, at
tached a few wires here and there, and
the machine started off again as lively as
â¢ev^r. There is also a fan set to run by
electricity or water power. Leberer lias
been making hisowti plowshares, and he
found that he needed both hands and
could not spare one to work the bcLdws,
so he proceeded to overcome the diffi
culty.
Other attachments can be madeofcir
cv.lar saws, and almost anything that re
quires rotary motion. He sometimes
runs wires to squirrel-r>o:es and, watch
ing his opportunity, sends a current along
and kills the animals.
Young Leberer's room is over a barn
ami is a curious mixture of a junfcshop, a
workshop ana a studio. He nas a home
made electric bell on tbe door that works
faultlessly. Around the walls are several
very peculiar looking models, which he
explained are power ma< nines that he has
not yet completed. He has also a lele
graph machine which ticks to perfection,
the magnet of which id a clumsy look
ing piece of horsesboe. Little coils of
wire and small pieces of machinery are in
every corner and hang ali over the walls,
and lie taiks freeiy of the use and purpose
oi each.
One of the greatest incentives to younc
Leberer to deve op his inventive genius
was the necessity of dispensing with hired
help at the ranch in order to make both
ends meet. By the many adaptations of
his skill to the requirements of the farm
he has been able to do the worK of three
men and thus save considerable money
He preatly regrets that he has not the
mathematical knowledge necessa-y to de
rive the utmost benefit from his talent,
but there seems no hope that his desire in
this direction will be gratified.
TAKES A THIRD HUSBAND
Mrs. Sadie Reeves-Boyer Quickly
Takes Advantage ot Her
Divorce.
Figured in a Street Fight, in Several
Attempted Rcbberies and as
a Heroine.
Oakland Office Sait Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 11. f
ATKINSONâ REEVE*â In this city, Nov. 6
1896. by the Rev. <>. Jones, J. llKchell Atklui
â¢on to Mrs. Sadie A. Reeves.
Behind this simple announcement is a
story that will interest many people in
San Francisco and Sacramento as Veil as
of Oakland and Alameda County, the prin
cipals both having been well-known em
ployes of the Southern Pacific Company.
Mrs. Sadie A. Reeves ' was for many
months the station agent at the Oak-street
station of the Seventh-street local system
of the Southern Pacific Company. At
tention was first attracted to her by an
alleged attempted hold-up one morning at
.1 o'clock in which she figured as the
heroine, defending the company's money
with a ready revolver. Next she figured
as a. heroine in the role of preventing the
collision of two trains during. a heavy fog
by flaggirfg them in time to prevent trou
ble. A little later another alleged attempt
was made to rob the station while she was
in chars*, but the local idice threw so
much doubt on the affair that no atten
tion was paid to the report.
â¢While holding the position as agent as
Mrs. Reeves she was known in town as
Mrs. Sadie Boyer, the wife of a man wno
went blind after his marriage. She stated
that her parent-were highly connected peo
ple of Sacramento, who i.ad securea her
the position as Widow ! Reeves and was
fearful that if it was known that she
was ' again married she . would be dis
charged. , About three ' months ago she
applied for a divorce from Boyer, claim
ing non-support, although lie had gone
stone blind while living wi:ii her.
One day one- of the railroad auditors
came in a few days before the end of j the
month, and as her cash and ticket account
did not agree her services were dispensed
with on t-.e ". spot after ;. she/ i.-ad squared
matters. : At this time she was keeping
company with one Thomson, another em
ploye of the company. While out walking
one evening they met Buyer and young
Reeves leading him about. -. . Thomson ; re
ceived a good thrashing "from Reeves and
Boyer together and left Mrs.. Reeves to
get away from the irate child ana her hus
o&nd the best she could. 'â¢ Â§*2*feivJ
She said then that the was to marry
Thomson :on the .'day- the -divorce V was
granted, but from the above it i> evident
that while awaiting . her freedom ; she
changed her mind and when 1 the oppor
tunity offered married another man. *

ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 11.â A. McCon
nell. engineer of the Alameda Water
Works at the Fitchburg pumoing station,
left suddenly the first of the week and is

plant was established, five years ago.
He had a delightful home and wife
with one little boy. Last Thursday tie

he usually went to work. His place was
filled and on the following day he was dis

Monday he was in the city and early in
the evening he was seen driving out of
town in a light spring wagon accompanied
by a young lady. A pisol shot rang out
on the night air, and Mrs. McConnell ap
peared on the scene. A scramble followed
and then promises were given and all
hushed up. McConnell Has not been seen
here since.
Yesterday the young lady disappeared
and cannot be located. Before going she

a number of her friends, but did notshow
any inclination to follow McConnell.
ELIGIBLE FOR FOOTBALL
Berkeley's List of Players for
Thanksgiving Day Com
pleted.
Thirty-Seven This Year as Against
Only Twenty-Five in 1895
Football News
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 21.â The list of
football men from the University of Cali
fornii who are eligible, according to the
intercollegiate agreement* to play in the
Thanksgiving game was completed to-day
by Manager Reinhardt and certified to by
the faculty. Thirty-seven men are on the
list, which is twelve more than last year.
Stanford has foity-two this year, accord
ing to their statement, which was received
here a lew days ago. Last year the Palo
Alto men sent up a list of only twenty
nine eiigibles, or thirteen less than this
season.
Two of Berkeley's men are from the law
college and two are special stud nts, who
come under the agreement requiring that
all such students shall nave at least ten
college units to tner credit and be taking
at least *en hours' work. The remaining
thirty- tnree men are in full standing in all
their classes.
At the outset of the training season it
was thought that Berkeley would have
several more men to enter than the Stan
fordites because of the great number that
turned out for practice, but it seems that
they have live less after all.
Following is the complete list from
Berkeley which wil] be forwarded to Man
ager Brown of Stanford:
H. S. Avery, W. W. Arkler, F. P. Anderson.
P. G. Allen, E. S. Birdsnll. J. W. Barnes, S. D.

H. Smythe, R. M. St.-admau, J. R. Seifridge,
G. E. Spence, J. R. Whipple. J. Walthull, iic-
Dermott, Mclsaacs und Simpson.
Waithall, tbe big guard from the law
colleee, who played on the Varsity last
TbanKsg ving day, will be over to-mor
row for the first time this season. It is
expected that he will tra n regularly, with
the hope of taking his old piace on the
team.
The men are practicing daily, notwith
standing the inclement weather. Cap
tain Ransome has posted a sign, which
reals: ' Practice, rain or shin-."
Outdoor work will be kept up until the
day of the great annual game.
Secret practice in the j.ymnasium began
this evening under the direction of But
terworth and Nott.
Seats lor the Thanksgiving game will be
on sale next Wednesday at me universuv,
and at Ciabrough & Golcher'a and E. T.
Al.en's in San Francisco.
BerKeley will have the stand t is season
whicti was occupied by the Palo Alto con
tingent last year. The University Club
will have 1.300 seats at their disposal this
year, as they did in 1895. Tne price of
seats will run about the same as hereto
fore. Accommodations for 15,000 people
will be provided.

Dr. Payne's Condition.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 11.â Dr. F. H.
Payne, who was thrown from a saddle
horse yesterday afternoon and seriously
injured, is improving. He re^uitied con
sciousness this morning at about 7:30
o'clock, after having been in a comatose
state ior eighteen hours. He recognized
one of his attendants for a few moments,
but was soon off in anottier swoon. He
raoovered himself once or twice later in
the day, but only lor a vary short time.
It has been almost impossible to adminis
ter any sustenance to the patient on ac
count of his condition of unconsciousness.

BETTER QUARTERS
The Merchants' Exchange
Has Entered Upon an
Active Campaign.
Wants a Charter That Will
Confer Some Direct Pow
ers on the Mayer.
PERMANENT COUNTY IXHIBIT
It May Be Jointly Undertaken With
the Assistance of the Board
of Trade.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Nov. 1L J
The Merchants' Exchange has decided
to occupy the quaint Spanish building
just completed at Thirteenth and Frank
lin streets.
The handsome bnilding is only the
width of a street from the narrow-gauge
depot, and, if possible, the lower floor will
be used for the permanent county exhibit
which is being prepared by the Board of
Trade. .The Merchants' Exchange will oc
cuiiy the upper story, and if a satisfactory
arrangement can be made between the
two mercantile organizations the whole
building w.il be leased.
The matter was discussed at the regular
meeting of tbe Merchants' Exchange, and
Director Gier of the committee on per
manent exhibit reported in favor of leas
ing the building.
Director Suhst of the Telegraph-avenue
committee scored the City Council. "I
don't know what to think of the City
Council," he said, "but certainly Tele
graph avenue should be attended to before
the rain sets in. What could be done
before the rains for $1100 would take at
least $2500 more. I have come to believe
that there is too much government in this
city. There are too many beads to our
government. The people are too far away
Irom the executive.
"I believe it would be a good thing to so
change the charter that there would be
The Quaint Building Into Which the Merchants' Exchange Will
Move. The Lower Floor May Be Occupied by a Permanent
County Exhibit*
but one head. We could trust any of our
past Mayors to do the right thing if the
responsibility were placed upon them."
It was decided to continue the move
ment to have the avenue improved.
The directors decided that now the e'ec
tion was over they would enter upon a
car- paign of active work, and each pledged
himself to make an earnest effort to pro
cure new subscribers.
CLAIMS BIG DAMAGES
Senator Beard's Suit Against
the Spring Valley Water
Company.
A Case Which Wi 1 Involve the Ri
parian R giits on Alamsda
Creek.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Not. 11.â State
Senator j. L. Beard, one of the foremost
horticulturists of this county, is making
a determined contest in behalf of the
farmers and fruit men along Alameda
Creek against the appropriation of the
waters of that stream by the Spring Valley
Water Company to supply San Francisco
witn water.
The suit which was instituted by the
Soring Valley Water Works to acquire the
riparian rights of Beard's land is being
resisted, as Beard claims that is property
has been badly damaged by the diversion
of the water from its natural channel and
its appropriation by the plaintiff cor
poration. H sets up a claim of $80,000
damages on this account.
liie water company is represented by
an attorney and a corps of engineers,
while Mr. Beard's contest is C"nducted by
Warren Olney, with A. A. Moore and J. C.
Martin as associate counsel. The suit is
in Juiige Ellsworth's department before a
jury and the testimony is largely upon
the question of what was the former value
of Beard's land and its present value and
depreciation alleged to be due to the di
version of the water.
A Banquet to Irish.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 11.â The Sound
Money League of Oakland tendered a
complimentary reception and banquet to
Colonel John P. Irish. About 100 sat
down to the banquet at the Masonic
Temple and the whole affair was informal.
The league considered that the good work
done by Colonel Irish during the cam
paign in the interest of -ound money de
served recognition and planned the "affair
for that purpose. The colonel told some
of his humorous experience* in chasing
after Air. Bryan in Kansas and Nebraska,
and H. O. Trowbridue and several others
mude speeches for the league.
Tuoluiune Pioneers.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 11.â The Tuol
umne Pioneers will hold their annual
banquet at the Ross House, in this city
Saturday evening. This may be the last

the survivors will soon be too few in num
ber to meet around the festive board.

OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 11.â An arrange
ment was concluded to-night by which
Edward Remenyi, the renowned instru
mentalist, will appear at the Macdonough

MATTIE HAS GONE EAST
Miss Overman Enters the Phila
delphia Florence Critten
den Home.
Her Whole Aim in Life Now Is to
D.vote Herself to Uplift
the Fallen.
Oakland OrFicE San Francisco Call )
908 Broadway, Nov. 11. f
Miss Mattie Overman, whose confession
in the Brown case is now in the hands of
the special committee named by the Bay
Conference to confer with tbÂ« Dabuque
Association with the view of having that
body rescind its action in taking the Rev.
Charles O. Brown into its fellowship, has
gone East.
It was learned to-day that tbe 7oung
lady left California some weeks aeo and
went direct to Philadelphia, where sue
has gone into one of the Florence Crit-
tenden homes maintained by the million
aire Charles Crittenden in memory of his
beloved daughter, who was taken from him
by death when she was quite young. With
the new surroundings and people un
acquainted with her past Miss Overman
intends to take up the study of the Bible
with a view of being a teacher.
It was while in Los Angeles in hidins
during the investigation made by the Bay
Conference that she claims to have been
completely ronperted. She claims that
her life before that period was one of
shams, but since then a new light has
come into her life, and her whole desire
now is to devote her life to teaching the
gospel and helping others wlio have fallen.
In ncr iast letter to Dr. McLean. Miss
Overman stated that *he did not intend to
swear to any more testimony against Dr.
JJrown, as she had already sworn to mucti
that was false.
Dr. McLean said to-day that he did not
want it to %ppear that he is seeking any
opportunity to express his views of Di.
Brown, but he says that when interviewed
and asked pointed questions no good pur
pOÃe is .-erved by giving an evasive answer.
Burglar* Arraigned.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 11.â James Ctr
hn und William Hawiey, who escaped

seneeis on the overland train. At their
request the case went over that an attor
ney might be secured.

Given Out This
Month.
A Shortage in the Annual Ap
propriation Is the Reason
Assigned.
WILL EXAMINE THE SITES.
School Directors Wil; Visit the Mis
sion â Lunch to Be Served
in the Schooihouses.
The Board of Education decided last
evening to withhold half of the salaries
of all teachers in the department for the
present month, in order to stave off a pos
sible deficiency for the present.
This action was made necessary by the
action of tie Board of Supervisors in cut
ting the department appropriation down
to $1,000,000 instead of granting tne $1,250,
-000 that was asked. It was understood
when the resolution was passed that the
money will be paid before the end of the
fiscal year, provided the funds in hand
warrant such a proceeding.
z A large: delegation of real estate men
and residents of the Mission were present
to learn the result of the deliberations of
the committee of the whole,' which met
during the afternoon to consider the mat
ter of a site for. the new Mission High
School. They met with disappointment,
for the committee bad decided to inspect
the sites proposed before coming to a
conclusion. The inspection will take
place on Satarday afternoon, and , the
board will hear, the report at a special
meeting to be held on Monday night.
On motion of Director Soper Superin
tendent Babcock was authorized to permit
such arrangements for, allowing teachers
and pupils to be served with lunch in the
schoolhouses as may be deemed necessary.
This is simply intended as an experiment.

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
"Corinne" Is Drawing Large
Houses at the. Columbia
Theater.
Melodrama Reigns Supreme at the
California sni the
Grand.
Delia Fox in vaudeville opera at the
classic Baldwin and Corinne across tne
street at the Columbia in vaudeville opera
is resulting in the bigger a irliences pre
ferring Oori^nft Â»t p^nular rmces to Miss
Fox at Baldwin prices. Not that Delia
Fox has much reason to complain, for she
is doing a satisfactory business, and her
"Little Trooper" is niehtly well received.
Next week Delia Fox and her company
will appear in her latest comic opera suc
cess, "Fleur de Lla."
This will be the last week in which to
see Corinne. Next Monday Joseph Gris
ruer and Pbcebe Davi^ will begin an en
gagementat tne Columbia in "Humanity."
"Darkest Russia" is drawing good houses
at the California. It affords lovers of
melodrama an opportunity of reveling in
norrors and excitement galore. There is
an old proverb, "Scratch a Russian and
you'll find a Tartar," but if you divest the
characters of "Darkest Russia" of their
Muscovite trappings you will find the good
old characters of melodrama, from the per
secuted heroine to the female villain. The
acting is of the usual melodramatic school,
and does not call for any particular com
ment.
Captain Herne's war drama, "The
Minute Men," is affording unbounded
satisfaction at the Gran i, as war dramas
generally do when they are well staged
and acted, and the present production
can boast of both these elements of suc
cess. Some of the scenes are very pretty
and the buttle of Bunker Hill is shown
with quite heroic display.
"Reaping the Harvest" at the Alcazar is
a clever play, well acted, and is meeting
with its reward in good houses and liberal
applause.
The last nights of the excellent produc
tion of "The Gypsy Baron" are announced
at the Tivoli. It ia the first time that tne
present company has been seen in a
romantic work and the singing of the
principals as well as of the chorus deserves
unstinted praise.
On Sunday "Donna Juanita" will be
performed.
The Orpheum's bill this wees is good,
though it consists of holdovers, with the
exception of the dog orrh stra, which is a
pretty and novel exhibition. A number of
novelties are promised in the near future.

TEA ROSE WAS
SPEEDY AS EVER
Was One of Two Winning
Favorites at Ingleside
Yesterday.
Moylan, a Warm Choice, Had
His Colors Lowered by
Sana Bella.
LADIES' DAY DREW A CROWD.
Daylight Beat Ten no Out in an Ex-
citing Nose FinisH -Governor Bui
Took the Hurdle Race Easily.
Favorites never seem to run tip to form
on "ladies' day" at lngleside, and yester
day was no exception. The fair sex, as
usual, rilled the grand stand, all eager in
quest of information. Many red-hot tips
were passed around, and a few â very
fewâ materialized. Had it not been for
the win of Tea Hose and Shield Bearer
the first choices would have been retired
without scoring, as all of the others fin
ished back of lirst money. The attend
ance was unusually large as regards the
male portion of the population, and
business in the ring assumed boom pro
portions.
Eddie Jones carried off the jockey
honors by piloting two winners. H.
Martin, Freeman, Boblsom aud Maynard
earn piloted a winner.
The racing opened with a very bad
upset for the crowd. Imp. Miss Brummel
was considered a certainly for the six and
a half furlong tour, but the 6 to 1 chance
Marjorie, led from start to finish, and
yon, easing up, from Lucille. The favor
ite appeared unable to navigate in the
heavy going, finishing in fifth position.
Many thought the brushing race the
two-year-old Tea Rose engaged in with
Libertine on Friday last might have
effected her heart as well as her speed,
but she came out in the rive-lurlong dash
for two-year-olds, and simply walked in
ahead of the second choice, Candelarin.
Horatio took the show in a drive fion
Modestia.
Thirteen starters next lined up in a
fiix-furlong spin. Atkins <fc Lottridge
started one of their Eastern purchases, a
colt named Excuse, and he ruled a warm
2to 1 favorite. Not yet acclimated he had
to be content with thi'd place. After
making all the running the 15 to 1 chance,
Tonino, ridden by H. Wilson, was col
lared and beaten out a short nose by the
second choice, Daylight, carrying the red,
white and blue of the association's presi
dent. The others nnished in straggling
or^er.
Ed Corrigan's Moylan made his debut to
the California public in the fourth event
at six furlongs with but four entries. The
Eastern colt was made a pronounced fa
vorite at odds of 4 to 5, but was outfooted
all the way by imp. Santa Bella, who
finally won easing up by over three
lengths. Sabilla took the show Irom Bo
hemian Lass in a drive. The winner was
6 to 5 throughout the betting.
The mile and a quoricr hn^iu _<?..:.
resulted disastrously for favorite players.
Zaragoza with 148 pounds up opened a 3
to 2 choice, later reaching 8 to 5, with A/u ri
del and Governor Budd fancied in the
order n^med. Maynard on the latter iaid
away in second and third position until
reaching trie stretch for home, when he
took command and galloped in the easiest
sort of a winner. In a hard drive Alimark
an Arnndel took the place from Gold Dust
by a ncÂ«e. The favorite evidently could
not shoulder the impost allotted ami fin
ished fourih.
Nearly every one of the eleven starters
in the concluding >ix-furbng run received
more or less support. Af post time Shield
Bearer, with 5 to 2 a/ainst him, had a
slight call over San Mrf"co well played at
threes. The favorite and Peril raced well
together until belowtbe paddock, where
Jones on the lormer called for a final ef
fort, and, although A trifle weary. Shield

After Marjories easy win Frank

A MAN, A CANDLE
AND A GAS LEAK
They Raised the Roof Off
the City and County
Hospital.
A Workman and a Nurse Are
Slightly Injured by the
Explosion.
THE GAS COMPANY CENSURED.
Although Numerous Complaints Were
Made the Fixtures Were
Neglected.
A leaking gas jet, a lighted candle and a
careless workman. This trio caused an
explosion at the City and County Hospital
yesterday that wrecked about forty-live
feet of hallway, slightly bruised a nurse,
singed the hair Â»nd burned the arms of a
workman and frightened all the nervous
Scene of the Explosion at the City and County Hospital.
patients in the contiguous wards into
hysterics. The damage will aggregate
probably $250.
The explosion occurred at about 3:20
p. M. in the main corridor of the building.
Daniel Cameron, an employe of the San
Francisco Gas Consumers' Association,
living at 8 Angelica street, had entered
one of the large manholes in the ceiling
and was- walking along the line of the
pas pipe searching for a lean with a lighted
taper. Suddenly there was a flash, a
muffled report and then the sound of rend
ing timbers. About forty-live feet of the
roof collapsed entirely.
Miss C. L. Howard, one of the trained
nurses, was walking along the corridor at
the time, and was instantly buried in the
debris.
An alarm of fire was immediately turned
in, and Engineer W. H. Carson of the hos
pital with great foresight, rusned tn the
pas meters and turned off the pressure.
Otherwise a most disastrous conflagra
tion would surely have resulted.
A stream of water was then turned on
the ruins by the hospital corps and all
danger of fire removed before the arrival
of the regular firemen.
Miss Howard was found to be unhurt,
except for a slight contusion between the
shoulders. Cameron's' burns proved insig-
Dilicant.
"I have been constantly after the ga3
company, the Gas Consumers' Associa
tion and Mr. Hirsch, the chairman of the
Light Committee of the Board of Super
visors," said Steward Robinson, "on ac
count of the gas going out. On two occa-
Bions during the last ten days the gas
went out in the middle of the night, and it
was necessary for the officials to wake the
various patients and employes of the hos
pital to te suro nobody should be aspfiyxi
ated.
"The gas company and the association
are expected to keep the gas fixtures in
repair and the pressure equal thoughout
the building. The gas has caused a good
deal of trouDle, because of a crystalline de
posit in the pipes. The Gas Consumers'
Association said this was always likely to
occur.
"Friday the workmen were cleaning out
the pipes, and when they left we found a
pipe in the main corridor was leaking. I
went down to see Mr. Ludovici of tne Gas
Consumers' Association several times.

He complained that the company had al
ready done more work than they were
paid for, but promised at least to send a
man up to repair the leak.
"The workman was sent up to fix the
leak and you see the result. We have had
to bring all the lanterns, candles, lamps
and torches in the neighborhood into
requisition to-nieht to keep things light
enougn to perform our duties. I believe
the Gas Consumers' Association is respon
sible for keeping the gas fixtures in proper
condition according to contract."
THEY SETTLED IT.
The Celebrated Carter-Kedniond Breach
of Promise Case Has JBeeu
Compromised.
The breach of promise case of Mary Red
mond against Thomas Carter, the car
builder, has been compromised out of
court, and, it is understood, will be dis
missed.
The case against the millionaire created
quite a sensation. The plaintiff sued ior
$50,000 damages, alleging that the de
fendant had courted her, won her affec
tions and had then refused to make her
his wife. The settlement will obviate the
ventilation of various collateral matters.
WILL MAKE NO CONTEST.
J. J. Bauer Will Not Demand a Re
count of Judge Hunt's A r otes.
There is still considerable talk of elec
tion contests, but as yet no definite action
has been taken by any of the disappointed
candidates. It was published yesterday
that J. J. Raver would aid Frank Murasky
to contest the election of Judge Hunt to
his seat on the Superior bench. Murasky
was beaten by a narrow margin. Mr.
Raver indignantly denies that he has any
such intention and denounces the publi
cation as a malicious lie.
TWO SUICIDAL ATTEMPTS
Mrs. Emma Erickson Is Tired
of Living With Her
Husband.
She Throws Herself in Front of a
Cab'e-Car and Then Tries to
Jump Into the Bay.
Mrs. Emma Erickson, 74 Teh ama street,
made two determined but unsuccessful
attempts Tuesday night to end herlife, and
sue is now in tne Receding Hospital.
Her husband is Morris Erickson, a cook
at 13% Grant avenue. The couple have
been iiving unhappily for some years, and
about a year ago the wife, in desperation,
threw herself off Fisnennan's wharf.
She went back to her husband, and for
a few months he treated her kindly, but
she says he began his abuse again. Last
nieht she went to 13% Grant avenue to
accompany him honre. He was carrying
some packages of groceries, ana when
they reached Third and Howard streets
she says he called her a vile name and
knocked her down with the packages he
had in his hands.
She walked away from him and threw
herself in front of a cable-car. The grip
man divined her intention and stopped
the car in time. She was dragged off tho
track by the conductor and the car went
on its way.
Mrs. Erickson, still determined on sui
cide, walked alont: to the water front and
when she readied a wharf near the ferry
she walked on to it, took off her jacket
and skirt and was in the act of jumping
into the bay when a watchman caught
her. She struggled to get out of his
grasp, but be held her and took her to the
Harbor Police Station. From there she
was taken to the Receiving Hospital in
the patrol wason.
The couple have four children, a girl 16
years of age, a boy and twins, a boy and a
girl.
The woman was in a highly nervouH
and excited state when taken to the hos
pital. She said she could not stand her
husband's conduct and she was not afraid
to dip, as her sister would take care of her
children.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12. 1896.
A NEW SCHOOL
OF MEDICINE
Purpose of the California
State Therapeutic
College.
Wealthy Men of the Country
Interested in the Under
taking.
NOW SECURING A FACULTY.
Iq Two Weeks Names of All the
Officers and Many of the Fac
ulty Will Be Known.
Last Monday articles of incorporation
of the California State Therapeutic Col
lege were liled. This is really the iucep
tion of what promises to be a most novel,
and, from the work expected to ba ac
complished, gigantic enterprise under
taken in the medical world.
The objects of the incorporators, as set
forth by their declarations, are to en
courage, reform, educate and qualify in
therapeutics, arts, philosophy and science,
and to give tne right as physicians to pre
scribe in the branches of electricity,
hemospasia, hypnotism, magnetism,
psychic and menial healing, materia
medica, astrology, occult forces and
science in the treatment of diseases, thus j
guarding against the indiscriminate use
of said forces and arts.
So much for the declarations as set forth
in the articles of incorporation. But the
movement really amounts to a vast deal j
more than ttlat â it is virtually an attempt
to establish a fourth school of medicine,
as may be gleaned from the following in
terview with Dr. T. G. Carpenter, one of
the directors and incorporators, and
named in the articles as the president:
"There are now three medical schools,"
said Dr. Carpenter, "the allopathic, the
homeopathic and the eclectic. We are
now engaged in what promises to be a
successful attempt to found a fourth school.
We will enlarge and teach in a broader j
sense than the other schools.
"The other schools do not teach elec
tricity, hemospr.sia, hypnotism, mag
netism, psycuic and mental healing, or in
fact anything mentioned in our articles of
incorporation. Any method in the treat
ment of disease proving to be truly scien
tific will be thoroughly investigated. In
this we will not be bound down by iron
clad rules as are the other schools.
"1 myself am a graduate ot the Russ
Medical College of Chicago, an allopathic
institution, and the Goss Eclectic Medical
College of Denver, and my experience ir.
tnose schools has led me to advocate the
proposed new school with strength and
determination.
"Another object we have in view is to
protect the people from many who are
practicing without due qualification. All
who qualify in the branches taugbt in this
school will be cranted the same privileges
as the graduates of the old schools of med
icine.
"A number of wealthy men throughout
the State have subscribed tc the under
taking and are interested in it to the ex
tent of giving us most substantial aid."
Although the directors will not <!ivulge
the location at present it is known that a
blocic of land, luO feet front and 150 feet
deep, overlooking the bay and within easy
reach of thecenterof this City, has been
donated as a building site by the head of
the astrological department, RtÂ»v. Isaac
Rumfonl, an Easterner, who will come
here in January.
The directors and incorporators are: T.
G. Carpenter, M.D. ; Louise S. Drew, S.D. ;
A. T. Sherwood, M.D. ; E. McCarthy anil
A. P. Merrill. Dr. Carpenter has been
elected president and Louise S. Drew sec
re tnry.
The college is a logical offshoot of the
California State Therapeutic Society, le
gally chartered February Hi, 1895. Some
of those connected with this society and
interested in the founding of the college
are B. Sturman, M.D.; W. M. Park M.D :
J. M. Peebles, M.D.. A.M. ; W. Tanner'
M.D.; \\\ M. Forster, M.D.; Neiiie
Beigtile, M.D. ; Samuel H. Roberts, M.D. â¢
Lucy A. Chandler, M.D. ; J. N. Wilkins]
M.D. ; Professor Joseph Rodes Buchanan'
M.D.; T. G. Carpenter, M.D. ; W. E*
Pritchard, M.D.
It is stated that one of the best faculties
to be had, men whose names are watch
words in the medical and scientific world,
is now being secured.
The next meeting of the directors will
be held the first Tuesday in December, at
which time something more definite can
be stated. The trustees are now at work
on a design for the buiiding.
Within two weeks the names of the trus
tees and the faculty, so far as secured,
be given forth for publication.
CHAMPION PUGILISTS
George Lavlgne and Charles McKeever
â¢Will Fight Under the AuÃpicea of
the Olympic Club.
Billy Kennedy, the superintendent of
the Olympic Club, was a very happy man
last evening. Billy has been correspond
ing with the manager of GeorÂ£e Lavigne
and Charles McKeever of Philadelphia
with the object of consummating a match
between those two noted pugilists. Yes
terday he received a dispatch from fc'aru
Fitzpatrick that Lavigne would meet Mo-
Keever under the auspices of the Olympic
Club in a ten-round contest "if a purse"
of ?3000 was guaranteed and $500 ex
penses.
Kennedy stated that the club will give
that amount, and he will so inform Fitz
patrick immediately.
McKeever is satisfied to fight Lavigne
for any reasonable purse, and therefore
the match is as eood as made. In all
probability the contest will be held in the
Pavilion some time in the latter part of
December.
McKeever has already proven himself
n great tighter, and as he is the only man
in Lavigne's class who Has any license to
meet the champion the sports of this City
can count upon seeing another grand bat^
tie bctw.een the greatest of the great in
pugiiism.
It was rumored abont town last evening
that the Occ dental Athletic Club will sign
Jeffries of Los Angeles today to fitht Van
Buskirkof the Olympic Club, some time
in December.
Barney Farley, manager of Jimmie An
thony, posted $250 yesterday as proof of
his sincerity to match his charge to fight
any man in America at 115 pounds for
$1000 a side and the best purse obtainable.
The challenge is open to the world.
JacK McAuliffe stated yesterday that if
he is successful in bis fight with Jimmy
Carroll on the evening of the 20th inst. he
will meet George Lavigne at catch weight.
McAuliffe can no longer train down to tDe
light-weight limit, which is 133 pounds.
He will scale close to 145 pounds on the
night he fights Carroll.
Counting; the Ballots.
The official count of the ballots went slowly
on yesterday, slxty-beven precincts of the
Thirty-third, Thirty-iourth and Thirty-fifth
districts being counted. The usual number of
citations to election officers to appear and sign
tally lists and other documents were issued
It will be thirty days belore the ballots are all
counted.

CLOTHING HOUSE FIRE
Raphael & Co.'s Loss by Smoke
Will Reach High Up in
the Thousands.
The Chemical Engine Docs Away
With the Usual Fiooi Occa
sioned by Water.
The amount of los 3 sustained by J. W.
Raphael & Co., the well-known clothing
establishment at 9 Kearny street, occa
sioned by the recent fire, will reach, it has
been estimated, many thousand dollars.
The damage done, outside of the total
destruction of the handsome show-win
dow, is due, however, entirely to the
smoke that filled the four stories of the
build in kf.
The fire, which broke oat in the show
window, for a short time threatened to be
a serious conflagration, but by the timely
arrival of the fire companies irom an alarm
turned in from bex 48, the fLinies were
quickly extinguished with the chemical
hose.
The blaze is supposed to have originated
from the crosi-ingof the electric wires in
the window, <vhich are used for the pur
pose of lighting up the building.
The massive panes of plate glass broke
with a crasii, from the effects of the heat,
and smoke poured into the store in smoth
ering volumes.
Through the elevator shaft the smoke
ascended to the second and third stories of
the building, and in a short time each of
the various departments was one dense
mass of black smoke.
Mr. Raphael, in speaking of the matter
yesterday, highly comniended.tbe action of
his clerks on the upper floors in throwing
open the windows and allowing a portion
of the gases to escape, which probably di
verted a spontaneous combustion and the
destruction of the entire premises.
The recent innovation of the chemical
engine has been a boon to the un
fortunate merchants in case of tire.
The damage done to goods is much
more serious if occasioned by a flood of
water than by a volume of smoke. This

fact was clearly demonstrated in yester
d:iy'? conilagration, the seriousness of
which was diveited only by the use uf the
chemical hose. In place of the probable
total damage of the lower floor by water
the only loss sustained is due to the smoke
that filled the building.
