LOTH TO LEAVE HIS PAETY.
But Says That McKinley's Success Is
the Only Salvation for the
Country.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 2.â The Bnn
to-morrow will publisn the following inter-
Tiew with the rion. Bourke Cockran, who
returned from Europe on Sunday :
"What is your opinion of the political
situation ?"
"1 regard it as the gravest In the history
of the country, exceeding in importance
the crisis of 1860. The secession move
ment was but an attemnt to divide this
country between two governments, each
of them designed to protect property
within the limits of its jurisdiction. The
movement launched at Chicago is an at
tempt to paralyze industry by using all
the powers of government to take prop
erty from the hands of those who created
it and place it in the hands of those who
covet it.
"This ie a question of morals as well as of
politics. No political convention can
issue a valid license to commit offenses
against morality, and I decline to follow
Mr. Bryan in a crusade against honesty
and the rights of labor."
"Do you mean that you will actively op
pose the Democratic party or abstain
from an active support of it?"
"In a contest fo? the existence of civira
tion no man can remain neutral. Who
ever does not support he forces of cder
aids the forces of disorder. If I can do
anything to thwart a movement the suc
cess of which I would regard as an irre
parable calamity, not only to this country
but to civilized society everywhere, I shall
certalniy do it."
"What do you think of Tammany's Â»c
-tion in indorsing the ticket?"
"I simply cannot understand it. They
strongly opposed the platform at Chicago
on the ground that it was an assault on
the integr.ty of the Nation. They decline
to ratify it even now, which shows they
nave not changed their opinion of it. Yet
they have indorsed the candidate who
stands upon it, and whose election will
mean that the platform which they have
themselves denounced as a singular com
bination of lunacy and villainy shall be
incorporated into the statute law of this
country."
"Will you support Major McKinly out
right, or do you favor the nomination of
another Democratic ticket f"
"I beiieve that all Democrats who are so
thoroughly in favor of sound money that
they place the defeat of Bryan above the
success of any organization or party
should meet in convention for the purpose
of considering the form ana method by
which they can give the most efficiency to
their motion. For my part I don't be
lieve that the nomination of other candi
dates for President and Vice-President,
however eminent and deserving they
mig'H be personally or politically, would
serve any useful purpose; nobody believes
they could be elected, and any Democrat
whose hostility to Populism and Repub
licanism would not allow him to support
either Bryan or HcKinley, could show his
opposition to both by remaining at home
on election day quite as well as by voting
for a third ticket.
"It would be more convenient to himself
individually and would not create a vis
al'le separation between himself and his
party organization. Nevertheless, it is
very important in a movement of this
character that men intending to rupture
the party ties of a lifetime should be sus
tained by a sense of association among
themselves. That end could be attained
by the adoption of a platform declaring
for soand money; against extravagant
appropriations; in favor of economical
administration in every department of
Government; in favor oi a tariff for
revenue only and ample for tflat purpose;
against the paternalism of the Republican
party and the Populistic socialism of both
the Chicago and St. Louis conventions; in
favor of that Ame:ican liberty wnicb can
be mainted only by so limiting the power
of Government that it can never interfere
with the daily concerns of law-abiding
citizens.
"The plank of pressing importance in
such a platform is of course the currency
plank. Now the mere election of McKin
ley will be the defeat of the free silver
movement. The obvious policy then
would be to indorse the McKinley electors
and thus secure the immediate success of
the main feature of the platform. The
Democrats who will have achieved the
success of their financial plank by the
election of McKinley wih yet constitute
an opposition to tne Republican party
the day after election based on principles
which are certain to be ultimately adopted
by the American people. What is needed,
therefore, is not a new ticket, but a new
platform w:>ich will declare in unmistak
able language the cardinal features of the
party laith and which, while indorsine
McKinley electors, will provide for a
really Democratic opposition to the Mc-
Kinley administration during the period
of its existence."
"What is your opinion of the ultimate
outlook?"
"Everything depends on the manner in
which this campaign is waged. To my
mind tnere is but one test of prosperty
which can be applied to a country, and
that is the rate of wages paid to labor.
There can be no prosperity where low
wages are paid. There can be no distress
â Â»Â»ete the rate of wages is high. It can
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
easily be determined that this whole free
silver movement is a conspiracy against
wages, and if the campaign is fought on
this line I have no doubt that every North
ern State â that is to say, every State of
the Union in which it is practicable to
hold a free election â will be carried by the
intelligence and morality of the American
people against the monstrous propositions
submitted to them by ihe convention
which nominated Mr. Bryan for the Presi
dency."
CHAIRMAN JUNES' PLANS.
The Democratic Chieftain Preparing to
Open His. Campaign.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 2.â Senator
Jones of Arkansas, chairman of the Na
tional Democratic Committee, arrived in
Washington to-day, and after a few hours'
rest at his residence went down to the
headquarters of tne Democratic Congres
sional campaign committee, where he had
an hour's talk with Secretary Gardner.
To-night the Senator said he was not yet
ready to announce the executive commit
tee, although it was possible that he
would name several of the members in a
day or two. He had practically made up
his mind as to some of them, but he did
not care to disclose them to-night. Per
haps the executive committee would not
be announced, or, at any rate, completed
until the full meeting of the National Com
mittee in New York on the 11th inst. At
that time the location of the National
campaign headquarters will also be se
lected, and in all probability the selection
would not be made before that time. The
Senator's choice for headquarters was
about evenly divided between Washing
ton and Chicago.
With regard to the insinuation of W. L.
Peek in the Atlanta Journal yesterday,
that he (Chairman Jones) had expressed
willingness to sacrifice Sewall and urged
Watson's nomination, the Senator said to
night it was utterly baseless. He bad re
ceiced a note from Mr. Peek stating that
Watson's nomination would be the salva
tion of Bryan, and he had not answered it
nor paid any attention to it. He had been
in St. Louis during the Populist conven
tion, but had r ever gone to any of its ses
sions nor participated in its work.
The Senator says he sees nothing but in
dications oi Democratic success wherever
he goes, and that far from any possibility
of the reaction the "gold bugs" are relying
on, the free-silver cause continues to show
a healthy and rapid growth.
"Those people who are looking for a re
action," said the Senator, "get their in
formation from the same sources that an
nounced up to a few months ago that the
silver lunatics were all dead or dying,"
Senator Jones says he will remain in
Washington all the week. It is expected
many prominent Democrats will meet
him during that time, including Senator
Gorman, who usually spends Mondays in
town. It is predicted that soon after see
ing Senator Gorman Chairman Jones will
announce the executive committee, or
part of it, and tnat a decision will be
reached as to whether an advisory com
mittee will be needed t is year.
GREETINGS FROM THE TIGER.
Sons of Tatnmenund : Send h Congratula
tion* to Bryan. .'.
LINCOLN, Neb., August 3.â This was a
quiet Sunday for Mr. Bryan. He attended
services at the First Presbyterian Church
in the morning and took a drive in the
afternoon. His brother, who resides in
Omaha, was his guest at dinner. . .
A number of telegrams from Congress
man Sulzer and other Tammany leaders
congratulating Mr. Bryan on his indorse
ment by the Tammany executive commit
tee have been received by the nominee.
The statement made by Senator Thurs
ton that Mr. Bryan is in the pay of own
ers of silver mines are to be answered. The
person who will reply to them has not
been named, but he will probably act by
authority of Mr. Bryan.
Mr. Bryan's attention was called to
night to a statement published in a Chi
cago paper this morning that he had
promised the position of Attorney-Gen
eral, in the event of his election, to Gov
ernor Altgeld. He immediately dictated
the following and handed it to The United
Press representative:
In order Â£o answer, once for all, rumors in
regard to places promised, I desire to say that
1 have not directly or indirectly promised any
office oi any kind to any person whomsoever,
and shall not, during the campaign, promise
any office of any kind to any person.
PLANS OF KANSEN FUSIONESTS.
Democrat* Will Give the State Ticket to
the I'opulists.
TOPEKA, Kan., Aug. 2.â Ex-Senator
John Martin, a leader of the Kansas De
mocracy, is authority for the statement
that the Democratic State Convention at
Huichinson Tuesday will nominate no
candidates for State offices, but that ac
tion will be deferred pending the action
of the Populist convention, which meets
at Abilene on Wednesday, and that the
nominees of the Abilene convention will
then be indorsed by the Democrats. As
to Presidential electors, according to Mr.
Martin, there will probably be a fair divi
sion, representation being given to each
of the several political organizations favor
able to free silver legislation. The electors so
nominated will be instructed to vote for
Bryan and ior either Sewall or Watson,
whichever has the majority of votes cast
in the United States.
Fusion in Nebraska.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Aug. 2.â Populist con
ventions were held in a majority of the
counties of Nebraska yesterday. The sen
timent almost without exception was
favorable to fusion with the fre.'-silver
Democrats on both State and county
officers. The Populist State Convention
will be heJd at Hastings Wednesday. A
straight ticket wiil be nominated and
later the Democratic State Convention, if
present plans are adhered to, will indorse
it in its entirety, the Populists agreeing,
of course, to support Bryan and Sewall on
the National ticket. In one or two coun
ties the middle-of-the-road members of
the party made mild protests, but any sort
of a revolt is improbable.
The Mud-HUnger at WorK.
KEARNEY, Nebe., Aug. 2.â ln a Popu
list rally here last night District Judge C.
R. Bcott of Omaha caused a sensation
when he in his speech classified McKinley
and Senator Sherman with HerrMost, and
declared that he had sent better men than
President Cleveland to the penitentiary.
Judge Scott gained notoriety several
months ago by ordering newspaper men
sent to jail for criticizing his course on
the bench. He was elected as a Republi
can, but has recently been an advocate of
Populistic doctrinea.

CUBAN LEADERS ARRIVE,
Are Picked Up by a Pilot-Boat
Twenty-Five Miles From
Key West.
They Bring Important Dispatches for
the Junta and Say the Outlook
Is Cheerful.
KEY WEST, Fla., Aug. 2.â ThiÂ» aft
ernoon the pilot boat Glance returned to
port, having picked up a small boat twen
ty-five miles ont in the Gulf, with Com
mander Joaquin Delgado, Lieutenant Fer
nando de Velasco and a Spanish boatman,
the party having left Cuba last Friday
night. Saturday morning they fell in
with a Norwegian bark, which took them
on board and brought them over. The
boat they left Cuba in, being in a leaky
condition, the captain of the bark ex
changed with them a better one.
Commander Delgado brings important
dispatches for the Cuban Junta. Being
interviewed he said that provisions were
very scarce in Pinar del Rio district, but
plentiful in the province of Havana. He
said that battles are of daily occurrence in
Pinar del Rio, which province, with the
exception of the capital, is in the hands of
the insurgents.
Lieutenant Velasco is a member of Gen
eral Zayas' s taff. Being asked about the
reported death of Zayas, he stated it was
not true; that he left Zayas on Friday,
and that he was well.
He claims the report started from the
fact that a young. man was killed a few
days ago who bore some resemblance to
Zayas, and the Spaniards, eager to spread
such a report, grasped at the faot of the
resemblance to report that General Zayas
was dead.
Delgado and party left Cuba from
Mariel, and just as they were about to
leave three Spanish soldiers came upon
them, when a band-to-hand fight took
place. Delgado and his companions killed
the three. The blood-stained machetes
captured from the Spaniards are now in
the possession of a Cuban club in this city.

are affected.
RIOTOUS STRIKING TAILORS.
Non- Union Men Being Taken Into the
Brotherhood, But Not Without Vig-
orous Persuasion.
NEW YORK, N. V., ug. 2.â Rioting
was the chief feature of iÂ£e tailors' strike
on the East side to-day, and although
there were but few arrests made. Acting
Captain Hogan kept his reserve ready to
quell any disturbance that might occur.
On account of the Contrators' Associa
tion deciding at a meeting Saturday niirht
to open their shops to-ciay and to take
union or non-union men to work, the
Brotherhood of Tailors had committees in
front of every shop at 5:30 o'clock in the
morning and as the men came to work
tried to persuade them to join the strik
ers. In most cases the committees were
successful, but not without several small
fights which the police quickly stopped.
When Leander Schoenfeld was seen and
asked what he thought the outcome of the
present situation would be he replied:
"The situation to-day is much better
than I ever expected after a ten-day strike
and my men are more determined than
since they went out. I am almost posi
tive that the contractors will realize in a
few days that if they care to run their
shops they must settle their differences
with the Brotherhood of Tailors."
During the afternoon it was figured that
about 1500 non-union men who were go
ing to work this morning had joined the
strikers. All the shops that signed the
agreement with the brotherhood were
working during the day and took in about
1300 of the strikers.
From reports received from Brooklyn
and Brownsville it is learned that the men
there are still out.
MURDERED BY HIS SON,
Beaten and Choked to Death
While His Helpless Wife
Looks On.
Shoking Fate of an Aged Miner Who
Had Administered a Fath
erly Rebuke.
GREENSBURG, Pa., Aug. 2.-one of
the most fiendish murders ever committed
in this locality was perpetrated at the lit
tle mining village of Darragh, near the
Madison Coal Works, last night about 12
o'clock. Patrick Coyle, a gray-haired
miner 70 years of age, was pounded and
choked to death by his son, Walter Coyle,
aged about 24 years. Old Mrs. Coyle, the
mother of the murderer, was an eye-wit
ness to the horrible crime, and on her
knees pleaded for the life of her husband,
but finally was compelled to fiee.
Young Coyle's wife recently became de
mented and was sent to an asylum on Fri
day last, Coyle's aged parents taking
charge of her infant. Young Coyle came
home last Saturday night and was re
proached by his lather for drinking and
neglecting his child. The young man
sprang at his father and choked and beat
him to death. The mother sounded the
alarm and a number of stalwart miners of
the neighborhood came in, and after a des
perate struggle overpowered the murderer.
The Sheriff was sent for and Coyle was
was taken to jail.

CRIMINAL CAREER ENDED
Remorse Drives a y Maryland
Murderer to Confession
and Suicide.
An Innocent Man Under Sentence of
Death, for One of His Many
Crimes
BALTIMORE, Md., Aug. 2.â A convict
known as Fred Whitney, who committed
suicide at the Maryland Penitentiary yes
terday, appears by his own confession to
have added murder to his long list of
crimes. Friday afternoon Whitney sought
ont Warden Weyler and intimated that he
meant to end his miserable existence. In
the Course of his conversation with Mr.
Weyler the man said his real name was
Frederick Hildebrant and that his home
wan in Detroit, Mich.
The "hold-up" of City Councilman
Swindell, for which Whitney was serving
an eighteen years' sentence, occurred on
March 23, 1895. In his confession he said
that while fleeing from the Baltimore de
tectives he killed and robbed a man in
Altoona, Pa., in April of last year.
"While we were in Altoona," declared
Whitney, or Hildebrand, to the warden
on Friday. "I assaulted a man on the
street, murdered him and robbed him of
his money, quite a large sura." For this
murder another man was arrested, tried
and convicted and was sentenced to the
penitentiary for life."
"Was your pal Williams implicated in
this murder?" asked the warden.
â¢'No, sir; I did it myself. I am alone
guilty and can stand the strain no longer."
The warden tried to gain more informa
tion from his prisoner, but failed. He set
apart an hour for a further conference
with Hildebrand, but the opportunity for
which the prisoner had long waited pre
sented itself yesterday, and the unfortu
nate prisoner threw himself from a win
dow and dashed out his brains on the
flagging thirty feet below.
Information from Altoona states that on
April 5, 1895, Henry Bonneka, a reputed
miser, was murdered. A man named
Wilson was arrested and convicted of the
crime, mainly on circumstantial evidence,
and is now awaiting the death sentence.
The suicide was 35 years of age. When
incarcerated in tne penitentiary he gave
his occupation as a ball-player.
John B. Williams, who was implicated
in the Swindell hold-up in this City, and
is serving an eighteen-years' sentence in
the penitentiary, confessed to Warden
Weyler to-day that Hildebrand's state
ment was true.
"Hildebrand killed old man Bonneka,"
he said, "and secured $11,000. I helped
him count the money. We buried it near
Altoona."
District Attorney Hammond talked with
the Warden of the Baltimore penitentiary
to-day and learned that Hildebrand was
insane when ha made the confession. The
news created a good deal of excitement in
this city, especially among the people who
believe Wilson and Farrell innocent, they
having been convicted of the murder of
the miser on circumstantial evidence.
WHITNER'S CONFESSION.
Mterepancif* in Hit Account of thej
Murdrr of Bonneka.
ALTOONA, Pa., Aug. 2.â lf the confes
sion of the convict known as Frederick
Whitney, who committed suicide at the
Maryland Penitentiary, is trueâ that he
killed Henry Bonneka in this cityâ an in
nocent man now lies under sentence of
death for the murder. There are some
discrepancies in the story of Whitney's
contession, as sent from Baltimore, as to
the facts of the murder. Bonneka was not
killed npon the street, but was found
strangled to death in his house here on
April 6, 1895. Whitney was in Altoona at
the time of the murder, was suspected,
and was followed to Baltimore by detect
ives, but not enough evidence was gath
ered against him to warrant hit arrest.
Three other men fell under suspicion, and
finally one of them, Frank Wilson, was
arrested. Wilson at first admitted having
been present when Bouneka was killed.
He afterward retracted his admission, and
was recently tried and convicted of mur
der in the first degree. He is now under
sentence of death in the County Jail. The
other two men who are suspected of hav
ing been Wilson's accessories are still fu
gitives from justice.
FUNERAL DAY AT BRIDGETUN.
Eleven Victim* of the Railroad Collision
liurird on the Sabbath.
BKIDGETON, N. J., Aug. 2. âThe bodies
of eleven victims ot the railroad collision
at Atlanta City were buried from this city
to-day. One was buried yesterday, to
morrow there will be four more burials,
and Tuesday nine. Thus, if no more suc
cumb to their injuries, there will have
been twenty-eieht deaths from among this
city's population.
There were so many funerals that the
facilities for burial were overtaxed. Great
crowds, largely made up of tearful women,
gathered in the streets outside the funeral
houses and flocked in groups about the
old stone church, Broad street and Over
brook cemeteries, where to-day's inter
ments took place. There were expres
sions of sorrow for the dead, words of
sympathy for the suffering and ready
offers of succor to the bereaved. Fortu
nately, though, there are very few if any
cases of real need so far as known.
TRAGEDY IN A SUNDAY-SCHOOL.
Frenzied Deed of a Prominent Citizen
Over a Debt.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Aug. 2.â A special
from Thomasville, Ga., says George T.
Russins shot and killed John P. .Lilly in a
bunday-school at Metcalf, Ga., to-day.
Both men are prominent in county af
fairs. It is thought Russins was crazy.
He had fallen out with Lilly recently*
about an account due by him to Lilly
Both men were at Sunday-school in the
Bapiist church. Rnssins drew his pistol
and rushed at Lilly, shooting him without
a word passing. Lilly fled to the door and
Russins pursued and shot him again and
then jumped on him and cut his throat.
Then Russins tried to commit suicide by
taking laudanum, but vomited up the do?e
and is now entrenched in his room with
pistol, razor and poison, vowing he will
not be taken alive.
STRANGE FATALITY.

the falling timbers. No other damage was
done by the storm.
Tragic Settlem'nt of an Old Debt.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug. 2. â Daniel
Clough, a well-known resident of Darling,
Minn., was shot and killed to-day by
George Eckman. Eckman and two com
panions met Clough, and Eckman began
to abuse him. Clough told Eckman'*
companions to take Eckmao away, as h e
wanted no trouble with him. This an
gered Eckman and he drew a revolver and
shot Clough. Eckman is about 60 years
of age and Clough was about 35. The onl y
cause assigned for the killing is an old
claim of Eckman 's that Clough owed him
for some work done some time ago.

FIRE DESTROYS A
FRESNO CHURCH,
The First Baptist House of
Worship Burned to
the Ground.
DEED OF AN INCENDIARY
Firemen Save the Business Sec
tion of the City Only by .
Heroic Labor.
END OF A RELIGIOUS FEUD,
Pastor and Congregation Had Quar-
reled for Possession of
the Sanctuary.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 2.â The First Bap.
tist Church, one of the finest edifices of
its kind in this city, located at the corner
of Merced and J streets, was destroyed by
tire to-night. The conflagration was of
incendiary origin. M. V. Dutcher, clerr
at the Hughes Hotel, was attending ser
vices at the Presbyterian Church, which
is in the same block.
At the first cry of fire he ran out, and as
he neared the Baptist Church he saw a
man running away with a bundle under â¢
his arm. Dutcher did not recognize tile
man. The fire started in an anteroom
under the north stairway of the church,
and it was from this place that the maa
was seen running.
The alarm was turned in at 8:45 o'clock. *
When the department arrived all that â 
could be seen was a little blaze in the base
ment. A hole was chopped into the base
ment wall and a stream turned on. The
nozzle broke and the stream had to be
turned off for five minutes, but there did.
not appear to be any necessity for a second
stream. The first was started .again,, but
suddenly the whole roof of the church be
came ablaze. Then the department real- .
ized the extent of the fire and went to work
with a will, but the edifice was doomed. â¢
Instead of a small tire in the basement
flames were raging between th A partition
walls and the attic in the c urch when
the department arrived. The firemen did
not know this until too late. A strong
breeze was blowing and it sent clouds of
embers directly upon the business portion
of the city.
Chief Hart was fearful that a disastrous
conflagration would result, and sent fire*
men to assist tne owners of buildings ia
wetting roofs. Fire broke out several
times on the roof of the Grand Central
stables, a wooden structure located in the
heart of the city, and it was with difficulty
that it was kept from gaining any head
way.
The large bell of the church fell at 9:30
o'clock with a terrible crash, which could .
be heard several blocks away.
The First Baptist Church was built in '
1884 at a cost of $4500. In 1892 it was en
larged at an additional cost of $7500. The
furniture of the church- was valued at
$1000.
There has been contention over tlie
church between Dr. Eshelman and his
congregation. Dr. Eshelman advanced
$7500 when the church was enlarged, and
the congregation claims that he donated
the money, having the pastor announce
the fact at the time. Afterward he se
cured a mortgage on the property for
money advanced, and the congregation
claims that he did this by questionable
means.
. Dr. Eshelman has a suit pending to fore
close the mortgage, which it was the in
tention of the congregation to contest.
Dr. Eshelman bad what he claimed as
his interest fully insured, but the congre
gation carried no insurance. The trustees
of the church recently wanted to take out
a policy, but on account of shortage of
funds the congregation did not order
them to do so.
The City Hall, which is only half a
a block distant from the church, was seri
ously threatened during the fire, but
buckets were brought into requisition and
the structure was saved. Just as the fira
at the church wa3 under control an alarm
wns sounded for some shed? adjoining tne
Snerry Flour Mills, which had been ignited
from sparks. The damage was small.
FIRE IS CRAMP'S SHIPYARDS,
Oreat Paint Shop Ueatroyed, Entailing a,
'Lost nf $10,000.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 2.â The
big yards of tne Cramp Ship and Engine
Building Company were last night the
scene of a fire which, before it could be ex
tinguished, swept out of existence the
great paintshop with most of its contents,
entailing a loss ci about $40,000.which, how
ever, is fully covered by insurance. The
burned structure was of frame, 200 feet
long by 90 feet wide.
The splendid steam launch of the battle
ship lowa was receiving its fittings in the
paintsbop, but a gang of men rushed ia
and pulled it out scarcely a moment before
the roof fell in. The burned building con
tained a big stock of paints, oils and var
nisnes, as well as all the fancy and hard
wood nttiius that are to go in tne vessel
in course of construction at the yards. All
these were destroyed.
Ohio Town .Swept by Fire.
BRYAN, Ohio, Aug. 2.â The town of
Kunkle. five miles sonth of here, was al
most totally destroyed by fire this morn

FROM A GERMAN
POINT OF VIEW,
Comments on the Socialist
Labor Fiasco in
London.
UNDISGUISED DELIGHT.
Bebel and Singer No Longer Re
garded as Formidable
at Home.
PITILESS JIBES OF THE PRESS.
Short oi Funds, Full of Dissensions and
Jealousies, the Organization.
Is a Wreck.
BERLIN, Germaxy, Aug. 2.â The Co
logne Gazette and other semi-official or
gans have during the past week devoted
more than the usual amount of space to
tbe proceedings of the International So
cialist Trades Congress which closed its
session in London yesterday. The fact
that more attention than usual was paid
to the congress was not due to recogni
tion of the importance of the meeting, but
to the delight in being able to expose the
crazy idiosyncrasies of the delegates and
tne general inaptitude of the socialists to
combine as a political factor. Following
on the Lillie (France) congress of social
ists, where the Frencn members of that
party tcoffed at the sentiments of the
German delegates regarding the war
hatchet being forever buried, the Lon
don meeting, where Herren Bebel and
Singer, Mine. Clara Zitkin and other Ger
man delegates were feeble and ineffective
figures amid the general riot, greatly helps
to make socialism more odious than ever
throughout Germany.
The Vorwaerts, principal organ of the
German Socialists, admits that the con
gress in London was a humiliating spec
tacle.
While inferring that the fighting and
other disorder was due to the absence of
competent management in the proceed
ings, the consensus of opinion, as ex
pressed by the press, is that tbe London
and Lille congresses ought to prove a per
manent check to the growth of German
socialism. Hitherto the socialist leaders,
when taunted with being unpatriotic, vin
dicated themselves and their party by de
claring that they were ready at any time
to tight to maintain the integrity of the
Fatherland. Tne lancuaee of the Germaa
delegates at the Lille congress ignored na
tionalism and proclaimed the solidarity of
international interests.
Commenting upon the scorn with which
the French treated these declarations, the
Hamburg Nachrichten says that tne .Lille
congress proves anew that t h e interna
tional solidarity of the socialists does
not stand the test. It adds that the Ger
man summons for the proletarians to
unite does not find a response among the
socialists of France.
The Munich Neuste Nachrichten says
that the turning of their backs upon the
Fatherland by Herren Liebknecht, Singer
and the other German delegates was re
ceived with condemnation by the Ger
mans. Liebknecht's anti-National pro-
tests against the acquisition 01 Alsace^
Lorraine by Germany only stirred up a
war feeling. The protest practically de
clared that tiie French desire to secure
revenge for the sequestration of the French
provinces by Germany was perfectly legiti
mate.
The Frankfurter Zeitnng, which is known
for its intimate relations with Herreu
Singer and Liebknecht, advises the Ger
man socialists not to talk about fraternity
where no fraternal feeling exists. Such
taik, it says, is thrown away upon tbe
French to the reproach of the Germans,
who caused an outbreak of chauvinism
that had been dormant for many years.
The Cologne Gazette says that the So
cialist leaders' denial of having any Na
tional feeling will estrange many of their
patriotic comrades, and finally the North
German Gazette calls upon tbe German
people not to allow the Socialists to fur
ther poison public life. The latter paper
is a semi-official organ, and its language
seems to be a threat of renewed Govern
ment action against the Socialists, but
nothing official can be learned as to
whether such action is contemplated.
If the delegates to Socialist congresses
continue to expose themselves to such uni
versal contempt as has been showered
upon them at the Lille and London gath
erings, the German Government will read
ily permit tbe holding of their proposed
international congress in this country in
. 1899, which the delegates to the London
congress feared would not be allowed.
They, therefore, arranged that in the event
of the German Government refusing its
sanction to the holding of a congress here
to hold it in Paris in 1900.
According to the Socialist press the
funds of the party are running very low.
These papers abound in complaints that
the comrades do not pay their dues, etc.
For instances, in Dortmund, where the
party has many thousands of members,
the collections were not enough to pay the
expenses of their delegate to the inter
national congress. The Rhenish, Saxon
and Bavarian district committees have
issued an appeal lor money. The failure
of the exchequers is partly ascribed to sus
picion on tbe part of the workingmen that
tbe money is not put to the use, for which
they intended it, as hardly a wees passes
without a case of embezzlement of the
party funds becoming known. Last week
it was discovered thai Landers, the leader
of the masons at Leipsic, was using tbe
strikers' money for his own purposes. All
these cases tend to make the workingmen
chary of the financial support they give
the party.
An electric explosive machine was sent
a few days ago to Colonel Krause of the
Berlin police. Fortunately its character
was suspected and the machine was
opened and its contents rendered Harm
less before any damage was done. The
police traced the machine and found that
it had been sent by an anarchist named
Paul Koscheman, who was arrested and
jailed. Max Westpbal and his wife and
Wiihelm Weber, all- anarchists, were
fcund to be implicated in the affair and
they are also under arrest. Machines
similar to that sent to Colonel Krause and
a auantity of explosives were found in
Koscheman's lodgings.
Chancellor yon Hohenlohe will come to
Berlin from the country on Thursday
next when he will meet Emperor William.
Afterwards he will proceed to bis wife's
estates in Russia on personal business.
Toe Emperor is now with his family at
Wilbelmshohe. An incident of the life of
tbe Empress there was a military spec
tacle that she ordered on Monday near
Cassel. The Hessian infantry and the
Hessian Hussars held field maneuvers, the
Empress and her three eldest sons attend
ing on horseback. The maneuvers were
held on tbe old battlefield. The general
in command described the various moves
to the Princes, who displayed marked in
terest. The Empress afterward ordered
that every man who had taken part in the
maneuvers should be given an extra litre
of beer at her expense.
Instigated by the Prussian agrarians
Chancellor yon Hohenlohe recently or
dered that an inquiry be held to ascertain
whether a special measure was needed
against the alleged increasing importation
of American horse flesh into Germany by
way of Belgium and Holland. Tbe re
port, which nas been submitted, concludes
with the statement that no further prohi
bitions are required.
The official Reichsanzeiger publishes a
decree forbidding the importation of fresh
porn into Germany through Holland.
The Government has again ordered that
reports be submitted to ii on the impor
tation of petroleum, evidently with the
idea of introducing a differential tariff.
The matter is revived with a view to
breaking the monopoly of the Standard
Oil Company.
The customs changes that will go into
force in September will considerably in
crease the tariffs on all mineral oils
through an altered system of calculating
the net weight. American exporters
are largely concerned in this matter.
The firm of John & Co. of Hamburg an
nounce the pooling of their petroleum
business with that of Phillip Pots of Mann
heim and the Passows of Bremen. These
firms will come to an agreement with the
German-American Company regarding
the prices of oil. Part of the petroleum
required by the pool will be bought from
tbe Standard Oil Company.
It is reported that 3500 Odd Fellows from
the United States will visit the Berlin ex
hiDition in September.
The opposition of the British Prime
Minister, Lord Salisbury, to a blockade of
the Island of Crete to prevent the Chris
tian insurgents there from obtaining arms
from outside the island and the general
situation arising from the revolt* in Crete
and Macedonia has had a bad effect on the
Berlin and Vienna bourses. Austrian
Government securities closed % per cent
down. German imperial securities, after
a similar decline, recovered.
The Cologne Gazette describes the situa
tion as more critical tnat ever.
The Tageblatt says that Great Britain
pursues her own aims, though in so doing
she menaces the peace of Europt.
An international woman's congress will
be hold in Berlin from the 19th to the

Mme. Kirt>chner, the wife of the Burgo
master of Berlin, and a number of French,
Russian and Polish ladies.
The oncft famous Wagner Society held a
meeting at Baireutti last week under the
chairmanship of Baron Seckendorf. The
annual report showed that the member
ship, which in 1893 was 8900, had fallen to

was deieated, but there is no hope that it
will continue to exist much longer.
THE COAST'S NEW HARBOR
Applications of Naval Officers
Anxious to Serve on the
Commission.
Plans for Engineering, Construction
and Repair Shops at Puget
Sound
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 2.â The
Navy Department has received another
application from an ofricer of tbe naval
civil engineer corps for assignment to
duty on the Santa Monica commission.
This officer is Civil Engineer U. S. G.
White, who was relieved some time ago
from duty as construction engineer at the
Pnget Sound naval station and placed on
waiting orders on account, it is said, of
the work done on the new dock at that
place. He was subsequently given sick
leave, and upon recovery from his illness
was assigned to duty at the New York
Navy-yard, where he is now stationed.
Civil Engineer franklin C.J Prindle on
duty at the New York Navy -yard is also an
applicant for assignment to membership
on the commission.
These applications are on file in the
Bureau of Navigation and were presented
to the Secretary before his departure for
Alabama. The Secretary is expected to
return to Washington on Wednesday of
this week and wiii confer with Rear-Ad
miral Ramsey in regard to the naval mem
ber of the commission preliminaiy to sub
mitting the officer's name to tbe Presi
dent. Rear-Admiral Ramsey declined the
appointment when it was tendered to him.
It is expected that an officer of the line, in
all probability Commodore E. O. Mat
thews, will be.given the billet.
Commodore Matthews is at present
Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks.
He is well known on the Pacific Coast,
having served on the slope and having re
cently made several tours of inspection in
that section. It is understood that the
question of appointing an engineer officer
was raised before the Secretary's departure
for Alabama. The secretary was then
considering the name of Civil Engineer
Endicott for the assignment. It was
pointed out to Mr. Herbert that it was
evidently tbe intention of the Senate to
have a line officer appointed to perform
this duty, as three civil engineers from
civil life are to be placed on the commis
sion to take care of the technical work.
The action of the Ss nate committee in
suggesting the name of Admiral Walker
as a member of tbe commission was also
brought to the attention of the Secretary
as an indication of Congress' desire that a
line ofricer should be assigned to duty on
the commission. The Secretary said that
be thongnt after all it would be unwise to
appoint a naval civil engineer as Naval
Commissioner, and has since been giving
his attention to the list of line officers
with a view of assigning one of them to
this duty.
A report has reached the Navy Depart
ment from Civil Engineer Richard C. Hol
ivday, stationed at Puitet Sound, stating
that the drydock at that point will be
completed within the next two weeks and
be ready for delivery to the Government.
The board which tested the drydock when
it was reported completed some weeks ago
will inspect the dock upon its completion
and report whether or not its suggestions
as to alterations have been adopted. If
its report is favorable the dock will be ac
cepted and the final payment of $50,000 on
the dock will be made to the contractors.
When the (structure is finished it is ex
pected that the battle-ship Oregon will be
ordered to Puget Sound to be docked.
Plans are being prepared in the Bureau
of Yards and Docks for a shop to be lo
cated at Puget Sound for the accommoda
tion of the Bureau of Construction and
Repair. Congress at its next session will
be asked to make an appropriation which
can be used to construct an engineering
shop.
An important board will assemble at the
Navy Department this week for thegmr
pose of preparing a plan for laying up in
reserve certain men-of-war which are in
commission on the North Atlantic coast.
The appointment of this board is a pre
liminary step in Secretary Herbert's plan
for the laying-up in ordinary of ships in
commission, which will be " commenced
this fall.
The board is composed of Rear- Admiral
John Walker, Chief Engineer David Smith
and Lieutenant H. M. Witzel. Besides
preparing this plan, the board is to recom
mend the place where they shall be laid
up, the size of the crew necessary to keep
them in good order, and what ships shall
be so treated. It is expected that the
board will not confine itself to the North
Atlantic Squadron, but will consider sh ipa
ot the Pacific Squadron as well. League
Island is the place which has been repeat
edly recommended as the place for laying
up ships on the North Atlantic coast.
Mare Island will, in all probability, be the
place where vessels on the Pacific Coast
will be kept in reserve.

CLOSE OF A HARD CAMPAIGN.
One of the M.st Bitter Contests Ever
Waged in the Southern Com
monwealth.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Aug. 2.â The
Alabama State campaign came to a bril
liant close last night. Almost every ham
let in the State was the scene of public
speaking, and in the larger places crowds
assembled on almost every corner to listen
to political arguments. Joseph F. John
ston, the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor, woundup the campaien in Winston
County, while Congressman A. T. Good
wyn, the Populist-Republican candidate,
closed in Limestone.
The outlook is rather confused at this
time. Captain Johnston, before leaving
last night for Winston Connty, stated
that he expected his majority to run up to
about 50,000. - Nathaniel Miller, secretary
of the State Democratic campaign com
mittee, places the figure at 40,000 and
says he would not be surprised if it went
to 60,000. He claims a majority of tbe
Legislature, making 70 out of 100.
John B. Knox, chairman of the State
campaign committee, expresses absolute
confidence in victory for the Democratic
ticket.
J. A. Bingham, acting chairman of the
Populist State campaign committee, stated
last night that he was confident from re
ports received already that Goodwyn and
his ticket would be elected by about 25,000.
He expects his party to carry all of the
white counties in the State, with the ex
ception of three, and says it will also se
cure a majority of the Legislature.
William Vaughan, chairman of the Re
publican State executive committee, stated
that he does not see how Captain Johnston
and bis ticket can win.
Two years ago Koib, the Populist-Re
publican candidate, carried almost all the
white counties in the State and Goodwyn
expects to do the same, and with a fair
election will divide the black-belt vote.
The registiation is the largest ever had
in the State, and the indications are that
an unprecedented vote will be polled.
Jefferson County, the largest in the State,
is claimed by the Democrats by 2000 and
by the Populists by 1000. The campaign
was one of the hardest fought in the State
for years.
MUST BE SOLID FOR SILVER.
Gold Cotnmitteemen to Be Dropped by
Illinois Democrats.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 2.â Chairman W.
H. Hinrichsen of the Democratic State
Central Committee came to the city to-day
to attend the meeting of the committee,
which takes place to-morrow. It is ru
mored that at this meeting the commit
teemen supposed to favor the gold stad
dard who have not already resigned will
be dropped and members known to be
supporters of the Chicago platform sub
stituted. Mr. Hinrichsen is confident that
the regular Democratic ticket will carry
every county in Illinois and almost every
township. He so expressed himself in a
talk to-day.
The County Central Committee has per
fected plans for the reception of Mr.
Bryan in Chicago on this trip East. The
committee will meet him on the train
some distance outside the city. So far as
known Mr. Bryan will make no speech
while here. The County Committee at its
meeting last night indorsed Bryan, Sew
all, Altgeld and the State and National
platforms.
Chairman Mark A. Hanna of the Re
publican National Committee is expected
to return to Chicago to-morrow to super
vise the organizing of some new depart
ments of campaign work.
AFTER WOLCOTT'S SCALP.
Certain Colorado Republicans Will Ask
the Senator to Jtesiyn.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 2.â A secret meet
ing of Republicans of Denver was
held this morning in the office of a well
known attorney, and it was resolved to
ask Senator Wolcott to resign as Senator
from Colorado. Representatives of the
Democratic, Populist and Silver parties
were present and voted with the Repub
licans to demand Mr. Wolcott's resigna
tion.
The greatest secrecy was maintained, for
it was the desire of those present to keep
matters quiet until a mass-meeting could
be held and the unanimous support of the
people obtained for the request. It is not
believed, however, that any notice of such
efforts will be taken by the junior Senator.
The course urged by the conservative
people is to leave the Republican organ
ization severely alone and try to unite all
the silver forces upon an opposition ticket.
The language heard on the streets and in
almost every newspaper of tbe State is
extremely bitter toward Senator Wolcott.
COLORADO SILVERITES.
Preparing for a State Convention to Be
Held in Denver.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 2.â The State
Central Committee of the National Silver
party will meet to-morrow at the Brown
Hotel. The committee will decide on the
time and place for the State convention of
the party and the apportionment of the
delegates to the State convention. The
convention will probably be held in Denver
about September 1.
The managers of the party in the State
have adopted a system looking to the
rough organization of the party in every
precinct and county. It is proposed that
the voters shall be given an opportunity
to participate fully in the work ot organiz
ation, and it is expected that all those
Republicans who cannot subscribe en
tirely to the Democratic platform will go
into the new party and increase its num
bers in the State.
Mrs. Frank Hall has been elected a
member of the State committee represent
ing Arapahoe County.

SMOTHERED IN IHE HOLD
How Six Emigrants Perished
While Hiding From Rus
sian Inspectors.
Parents of the Victims Sue the Owner
of Steamship Herman for
Damages.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 2.-David Mi,
lod and Joseph Lerner, the fathers of two
of a party of six emigrants who are said
to have been suffocated in the hold of the
German steamship Herman, while the lat
ter was lying in tne Russian port of Libau
<in January 2 last, have brought suit for
damages against the owner of the vessel,
H. Schuldt, a resident of Flemsburg, Ger
manr.
The facts became known to-day through
a letter of the lawyers retained by the un
fortunate young men's fathers, which has
been forwarded to the United States Con
sul at Flemsburg, apprising him of the
fact that a suit has been brought against
the owner of the vessel.
It is stated that the six men who per
ished were amortg a party of fifteen young
emigrants who had engaged passage by
the Herman from Libau for Hull, Eng
land, and that they met their deaths from
suffocation in one of the air-tight com
partments of tbe steamer, in which the
fifteen emigrants had been directed to con
ceal themselves by the officers of the ves
sel to evade the vigilance of Russian in
spectors.
It is not stated why the young men
found it necessary to hide from tbe Rus
sian officials, but according to the state
ments made In the letter to the Consul it
appears that the steamship officials had
informed the emigrants that the Russian
officials would not take more than twenty
minutes to inspect the ship, whereas four
hours elapsed before tbe vessel sailed.
When a sailor of the vessel, the letter re
cites, went to release the men they were
all unconscious.
The men were hoisted ont of the hold,
and after hours of hard work the lives of
nine were saved. The six others never
regained consciousness and died.
Their bodies, according to the letter,
were subsequently consigned to the sea.
The suit is based on the affidavits made
by two of the survivors. These survivors,
in their affidavits, say that the matter was
not made public on their arrival at Hull
because of the threat made by the captain
of the steamer that if any of tbe survivors
told about the fate of their unfortunate fel
low passengers, they would be sent back to
Russia. Accordingly, they did not men
tion the matter. The emigrants making
the affidavits only recently arrived here.
TWO NEGRORN LYNCBED.
They Were Implicated in an Attempt at
Assassination.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Aug. 2.â Two
weeks ago an attempt was made to assassi
nate C. D. Hunter, a prominent citizen of
Dallas County, while he was sitting on his
front porch surrounded by his family, two
loads of shot being fired at him. Fortu
nately he was not fatally wounded. Isa
dor Mosley, a negro, was arrested on
Wednesday, charged with the crime and
confessed, implicating Billy Hunter, an
other negro.
The two negroes were committed to jail
by a magistrate. As the Constable was on
his way to the county jail at Selma with
the prisoners, he was overpowered by a
mob of masked men, who took the
prisoners to a bridge and hanged them
both. After the hanging a volley was
fired into their bodies and the mob dis
persed.
Collision of Freight Trains.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Aug. 2.â Two
Louisville and Nashville freight trains
collided near Mountain CreeK, thirty
miles north of here, yesterday morning.
A negro brakeman and a negro tramp
were killed and a white man, who wÂ»s it.
the caboose of one of the trains, was
badly hurt. Traffic was delayed six hours.
BRUTAL DOUBLE MURDER.
Colored Man an* Woman Found With
Their Skulls Crushed.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 2.â A bru
tal double murder was discovered to-day
in an orchared in the rear of the summer
boarding-house in the suburb of Narbeth.
Ewert McDarnell, aged 35 years, and Mary
Brown, both colored, were found lying on
the ground side by side with their skulls
crushed in. The woman was a servant in
the boarding-housn and McDarnell is said
to have been her husband, although she
was known by the name of Brown. The
woman was of a lively disposition and it
is supposed some lover of hers killed the
couple. The police claim to know tbe
name of the man whom they suspect of the
murder and expect to have him under ar
rest shortly.
A'eto Minister to Guatemala.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 2.â The

by the recent death of P. M. Young.
BATTERIES FOR
COAST DEFENSE,
Presidio Artillery Will Be
Redistributed to Man
Them.
WAR DEPARTMENT PLAN
Barracks to Be Established in
the Vicinity of the Big
Guns.
A LARGER FORCE NECESSARY.
Hospital to Be Renovated for the
Better Accommodation of
Patients.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 2.â There
is a strong probability that the Fifth
Regiment of Artillery, stationed on the
Pacific Coast, will be redistributed with
tbe mounting of new batteries in that sec
tion. Emplacement for guns are now
being built along the slope, and when
they are reported finished guns will be
shipped to the West to be put in place.
l?or their care and preservation men in
tbe immediate vicinity will be required.
These emplacements are in some cases re
mote from the stations where troops are
quartered. To prevent the traveling to
and from, which would be necessary if the
existing conditions were allowed to con
tinue, it is the intention of the War De
partment to construct barracks at points
iv the immediate vicinity of the guns for
the accommodation of a battery or bat
teries of artillery.
The redistribution of the remaining four
regiments of artillery, all of which are sta
tioned on the Atlantic Coast, has already
been recommended by General Miles and
will probably take place just as soon as
quarters can be constructed.
General Miles returned to Washington a
few days ago from an inspection tour of
the fortifications of the New England coast
and the lake shores. As a result of this
inspection be urged, and his recommenda
tion was adopted, that auarters be built at
Hancock, near New York. These will be
manned with a battery when completed.
General Miles expects a number of guns
will be mounted by December: hence his
recommendation for the redistributing of
the artillery regiment
It is frankly stated by War Department
officials that when the fortifications tor the
Pacific and Atlantic coasts are ail com
pleted the present artillery force will be
totally inadequate to tase care of them.
The War Department has recognized
this fact for some time, and with a view
to remedying the condition submitted a
bill to Congress at its last session increas
ing the artillery arm from five to seven
regimen ts. A favorable report was made
upon the measure by the Senate Military
Committee and it will be brought before
the upper house at the beginniug of the
next session. In view of the great inter
est at stake it is the intention of tbe de
partment to bring strong pressure to bear
in order to secure, if possible, its enact
ment.
The hospital at the Presidio is to un
dergo extensive repairs. General Stern
berg, surgeon-general, who has just re
turned from a tour of inspection, which
included the Pacific Slope, has recom
mended, and his recommendation has
been adopted, that the hospital at the
Presidio be repaired and renovated and
that an addition for the better accommo
dation of patients' be constructed.
Plans for tbe addition are now being
prepared in the quartermaster's office of
the War Department, and when approved
advertisements will be issued for bids on
the worK.
The new pay system in the army, which
has been in operation only a few months,
is already a subject of complaint. This
system involves the payment of the men
by the post commanders instead of by
paymasters, as formerly. The paymasters
put the men's pay up in envelopes, which
are sent to the post commander for dis
tribution. With a view to ascertaining if
the complaints have any just foundation,
Paymaster-General Sternberg left Wash
ington to-day for the West. He will in
spect a number of the posts, and upon bis
return will submit his report to the Secre
tary of War.
Gossip is rife in military circles as to
who will be the next quartermaster-gen
cal of the army. The appointment, it is
expected, will be announced next week
upon the return of Secretary Lamont to
Washington. The Secretary has been
north and has communicated with the
President about the matter. Colonel Saw
telle, at present the senior officer of his
grade, seems to have the best chance of
securing the billet, although it was stated
Dy a high official of the department a few
days ago that Colonel Weeks, the junior
colonel, had a splendid show of being
General Batcbelder's successor. Besides
Colonel Sawtelie Colonel Luddington is
the only applicant for the assignment,
and his application he desires to be con
sidered only in the event of Colonel Saw
telle's failure to get the place.

CLEVELAND'S LABOR TITBIT OJX.
A. Sympathetic Strike of all Union Men
Seems Inevitable.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 2. â At a
meeting of the representatives of the labor
unions of this city to-night it was deter
mined to urge upon the Central Labor
Union at its meeting Wednesday the call,
ing of a sympathetic strike on account of
tne Brown Hoisting Company trouble.
As the unions reported and those which
have already expressed opinions in favor
of such a course contribute a large major
ity of the members of the Central Labor
Union a general sympathetic strike seems
to be likely. Tbe plan is first to call out
all iron-workers, who number about 20,
-000, and if necessary every union man in
the city will be called out later.
Four companies of troops are now
camped at the I3rown works and more are
likely to be ordered there to-morrow. The
situation is the gravest Cleveland has
ever faced. John Prince, thÂ« man shot
by the non-union man yesteraay, still lies
in a critical condition. The union men
are now arming, claiming that they have
the same right to carry pistols as the non
union men.

Two Freight Trains in Collision
LONG PINE, Nebr., Aug 2.â Two
freight trains |on the Northwestern col
lided on the embankment approaching
the Niobrara river this evening. One
train was awaiting the signal to cross
when the engine of the second train
crashed into it from the rear. Both
engines and cars were wrecked and the
track torn up for a hundred yards, but no
one was injured. It is almost a miracle
that both trains did not toppla over into
the river. Responsibility for the accident
has not yet been placed.

Strictly speaking, no! at least hard!/

"lost manhood" and "Nervous Exhaus-

Underneath the aahes the fire remains
aglow. It requires careful scientific treat-
ment to fan it into a bright flame of life
and energy.
Your descondency looks foolishâ is fool-
ish. Keeps you from getting well. It's
the worst part of your sickness. Try and
get over it. Try to look like a man- head
up, boay erect. Then do as a man should ;
get help in a common sense way.
But for the sake of your existenceâ for
the sake of those dear to you or dependent
on yon, don't play with fire. Leave quack
medicines â cure - all- and-every body nos-

Do as you would if you had something

Go to one who has devoted a lifetime to

cures where others try and experiment.
To the deuce with false modesty ! As if

SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 2.â The Re

everything in readiness for active cam
paign wort. The County Republican Club
has commenced its work by seeing that a

TO DEI tAT McLACHLAN
Democrats Fainly Endeavoring to Se
cure Povulistie S-upport.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 2.â The
breach between the Democrats and the
middle-of-the-road Populists is widening,
despite the efforts of bridge-buiidiug sil
ver people, and indications now point to
the probability of three different Con
gressional candidates being in the field.
The inevitable result of this will be the
election of McLachlan, the Republican
candidate. In fact, the silver men have
about abandoned their attempts at har-
moaizin? the faction and begun mud
throwing at the anti-fusionists.
The silver men have labored diligently
with their cantankerous neighbors to-day,
bat have been accorded very few crumbs
of comfort. One irate aiiverite said.-after
a bard day's toil for unity of action with
out results: "Unless " this" action is
promoted by motive* to accommodate
McLachlan and the railroad, I dnn't un
derstand what it means. If persisted in
that will be the net result, and rest assured
some of the Populist leaders will profit, by
the deal. It was out cf deference to the
Democrats that this district, who are in
the minority and wno it was understood
would name a good man for Congress,
that the Congressional nomination by
Populists was deferred at Sacramento."
COB*' WALL'S PROPHECY.
Predict* Victory for the Republican
Ticket in California.
SEATTLE, Wash., August 2.â Upon his
return to Seattle to-night from Whatcom,
whither he went yesterday morning to
look after property interests, F. B. Corn
wail, the San Francisco capitalist and
p litician, expressed himself more or less
freely regarding the Presidential cam
paign.
â¢â¢McKinley will be elected. That is a
certainty if the vote of California is need
ed," Mr. Cornwall predicted. "I figure
that there will be enough old-line Cali
fornia Democrats vote the Republican
ticket to secure the State for McKinley.
By November the issue will have nar
rowed down to the question of protection
and prosperity on the one side to anarchy
on the other. This was clearly foresharf
twed by the active participation in the
Chicago convention by Aitgeld, 'who, by
the wav, is an able fellow, and like Debs,
whichever way the election goes Aitgeld
will land on his feet. He is there for what
there is in it. You don't think Deos has
been ermine all these antics for physical

Fifth IHatrict Chairman Wrlch on the

SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug 2.â J. R. Welch,
chairman of the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict Populist committee, and also chair
man of the Santa Clara committee, who
was one of the delegates from this county
to the Populist convention in St. Louis,
was interviewed by a Call representative
to-day in regard to the nomination of
Bryan for President by the Populist con
vention. He said Bryan's nomination
was only secure.! through a tacit agree
ment that Sewall wouid withdraw from
the candidacy for Vice-President. He
ciaimed that th â¢ failure of Sewall to do
this would virtually be a betrayal of the
confidence of the convention by" tne Popu
list Bryan supporters and ihe chairman of
the National Democratic Committee.
Mr. Welch predicted that unless the
Democratic party made proper concessions
to the Populists, the latter, especially in
ttie South, would vote for McKinley.

White, the chairman of the notification

National Convention, will be unable to at
tend the notification of Bryan and Sewall
in New York on August 1.3. The Senator
is very busy with his law practice, which
accumulated during bis â¢ absence :in Chi
cago, and he cannot leave Los Angeles for
some time to come. - He has, however,
completed the official notification and for
warded it East, where it will | be signed by
all the members of the committee. The
presentation of the notice would naturally,
in the absence of Senator White, fall on
Senator Daniel, the temporary chairman,
but the Virginian is absent in Europe, so
Governor Stone of Missouri will probably
head the delegation. '

often occurred on board the Hermosa,
when plying twixt the mainland and
C3taiina, but this is the first birth which
ever occurred in like manner. Tne little
chap opened his eyes on this troublous
world when the steamer was about naif
way over to San Pedro. Tne 350 passen
gers on board gave three rousing cheers for
the boy and promptly christened h:m
"Herm&sa,' 1 in honor of his birthplace,
until a facetious man suggested that
"Himosa" wouid be more appropriate in
view of t c ?ex. Mother and son are be
ing cared for in San Pedro.

Northern California, in session at Garfield
Park for two weeks, closed to-night after
a series of Sunday services that began
with a sunrise prayer-meeting on En
deavor Rock on the cliffs and a farewell

PLANS FOR THE TURNFEST.
Three Hundr-d Vocalists to Join in a
Minhty Chorus.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aug. 2. -The Turn
fest executive committee had a busy ses
sion this afternoon, and settled several
matters of routine, which put the arrange
ments for the great festival in permanent
shape. There will be no hitch in the
carrying out of the varied and entertaining
programme tnat will begin with a recep
tion to the visitors on Saturday night.
The ladies' class of the Santa Cruz Turn
Verein will have charge of the reception,
and that is a guarantee that all who enter
the procession on that night will be de
lightfully entertained at the close of the
parade at the Turn Verein Hall.
The Sunday evening programme was
completed tciis afternoon. It provides for
a concert, to be introduced with a mass
chorus of 300 voices. Then there will be a
variation of the entertainment, to consist
of dumb-bell exercises by active turners
and club-swinging exhibition by the
ladies' class of San Jose.
This will be followed by selections sung
by the Eintracht Singing Society, the Har
monic and the Arion of Ban Francisco, the
Arion of Santa Cruz, the Singing Section
of Santa Cruz and the Singing Section of
Oakland. It will conclude with band
muaic by the Hastings band of Santa
Cruz. These features insure one of the
grandest musical events ever given in this
city, and will draw large audiences, for
the fame of the German singing societies
is boundless.
On the third night (Monday) the ball
will be triven, and that will be one of the
big features of the tnrnfest. The general
shoot will begin on Sunday morning at 10
o'cloct, and the prize shooting for Turners

prizes and trophies to the victors.
The pyrotechnic display will bo in
creased by 400 Roman candles that the
committeeman, Mr. Wessendorf, was this
afternoon directed to obtain from San
Francisco, so that feature wiil be certain
to make a big showing.
CAPE ARAGO ADVENTURE,
Two Little Children Drift Out
to Sea in an Open
Boat.
Rescued Just a Moment Before Their
Frail Craft Goes to the
Bottom.
: M ARSHFIELD, Ob., Aug. 2.â Two ch!l
dren. aged 8 and 10 years ; respectively, of
Lighthouse-keeper Sheldon at Cape Arago,
bad a narrow escape from 2 being drowned
in midocean on Friday afternoon. Mr.
Sheldon has a small skiff which -i he ; uses
in* fair weather, I and in which the 'â  little
boy and his sister when the water is
smooth. The children, v unknown ;to
their parents, took possession of the V frail
cockle-shell on Friday and - started '. off for
Empire for some candy. The young mari
ners were unequal to - the task * of ' manag
ing the craft, and about half a mile distant
they lost one of their paddles. ; The water
was quite rough and â  the 2 wonder * is> that
their craft was not Â¥ overturned. Being
born on the ocean; so to speak, they failed
to realize the ' dangers ? surrounding . them,
and with fearless little Jj hearts proceeded
toward Empire with as much speed as one
paddle would ', propel them. ,; ; : ." . â¢â '- ' "*-
The current was against I them and in-,
stead of mating â  any headway in the di- ,
rection of Empire the youthful navigators
were unconsciously drifting out to sea. It
was an hour after their departure from
the lighthouse station before the children
were missed, and a half hour later before
Mr. Sheldon discovered the skiff to be
missing. He has a powerful marine glass.
With this he scanned the ocean and dis
covered his little ones in the boat strug
gling with a choppy sea, about four miles
from shore.
Almost frantic with fear for the safety
of his children Sheldon hastened to Big
Bend, where he secured a large boat, and
with the assistance of another man rowed
to the rescue of the helpless youngsters.
He did not reach them a moment too soon.
Just as he transferred them from the skiff
to his big boil a large ocean steamer
passed within 200 feet of them, without
heeding the ;four imperiled lives. The
steamer created a tremendous swell, sub
merging the skiff and placing the larger
boat with its human freight in imminent
danger, but all hands reached the shore in
safety.
NEVADA COUNTY'S SHERIFF.
Marshal Gttchel yarned to Succeed the
Murder** Douglass.
NEVADA CITY,CAL.,Aug.2.â The Board
of Supervisors yesterday appointed D.
B. Getchel Sheriff to fill the vacancy
created by the killing of the late Sheriff
Douglass by an outlaw. Getchel is the
present City Marshat of this place and ia
a good officer. His reputation for bravery
is well known, Â»nd his appointment is
generally considered to be a good one.
He will retain Douglass' deputies.
Two more empty rifle shells were found
to-day near a tree a short distance from
where Sheriff Douglass' body was found.
This still further substantiates the theory
that the Sheriff was killed by an accom
plice of the dead robber.
San Diego's Youthful Horsethief.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 2.â George Me-
Ardle, aged 12, is the youngest prisoner
ever confined in the San Diego County
Jail. After evading the officers for two
weeks, he was to-day arrested on a charge
of grand larceny. On July 21 he was
working for Horace Metcalf at Point
Loma, and when Metcalf refused to pay
him all that was claimed to be due the
boy quietly took possession of a horse and
rode away. The animal was found later
in a corral in this city, where George had
given orders to have it well cared for. He
had been in hiding ever since until to-day.
BOON FOR YOLO COUNTY
Possible Establishment of a Beet
Sugar Factory Near
Woodland.
Farmers and Business Men Are
Awaiting a Visit From Clans
Spreckels.
WOODLAND, Cal., Aug. 2.â The beet
sugar industry has again been revived in
Yolo County. Yesterday afternoon an en
thusiastic meeting was held in this city
in response to a call by W. G. Hunt, Presi
aent of the Yolo County Sugar Beet Asso
ciation. Representatives from all Darts of
the country were present Mr. Hunt
caied the meeting to order and stated
that the objects were to devise means of
ascertaining the saccharine strength and
purity of beets. He had been in San Fran
cisco to interview Claus Spreckels on the
possibility of securing a sugar factory for
Yolo County, but failed, as Mr. Spreckels
was on a visit to Salinas. Since his return
he was in receipt of the following commu
nication from Mr. Spreckels' private sec
retary :
San Francisco, Jnly 31. 1896.
W. G. Hunt E*q.â Dear Sir: Mr. Clans
Spreckels is to aadress the farmers in and
about Salinas to-morrow. He instructs me to
state that he will visit your locality or send a
competent man there wi'hln the next week or
ten days to seÂ« your beet fields as they are.
Yoors trnly, Â£. H. Sheldon', Secretary.
At the conclusion of Mr. Hunt's re
marks Judge J. W. Snowball of Knights
Landing, who lias bad considerable ex
perience in raising sugar-beets, was called
on for a talk. He said Mr. Spreckels en
courage i Charles F. Reed to plant bets
and did the same with tne late Senator
Fair, who afterward purchased the great
Reed ranch, tne products of which were
sent to the Watsonyille refinery and pro
duced over 70 percent in sugar and over 80
percent in purity.
"We owe a great deal to Claps Spreck
els," said he. "He is an enthusiast and is
doing a great deal for California. Let us
wake up and take advantage of this op
portunity. Now is the time to move."
A committee, consisting of Judge Snow
ball, Charles Hoppin, M. Ditrgs, Mr.
Heckie and J. H. Dun_an, was appointed
to receive Mr. Spreckels or his representa
tive and show him around the county. The
visit of Mr. Spreckels is looked forward to
with great interest, as it means much to
the people of this vicinity.
South Santa Monica Wharf.
LOB AhGELES, Cal., Aug. 2.â There is
a revival of the talk that the Santa Fe
Railway Company intends to build a long
wharf at South Santa Monica and thus
be in line for oceanic business. The latest
name for South Santa Monica is Ocean
Park, and it is said to be a splendid point.
for receiving and discharging merchan
dise. This time the talk is that the piles
are to be driven out to deep water to en
able ships of the greatest tonnage to dis
charge their cargoes. This feature of this
work is a long way off, as it will require a
year's time from start to finish an>i an
outlay of from $2,500,000 to $3,000,000.
Nothing definite can be obtained from the
officials of the company.

SANTA BARBARA'S
MURDER SUSPECT,
Watch Kept on an Alleged
Accomplice of Cyrus
Barnard.
NEW THEORY ADVANCED
Proof That the Slayer of Mrs.
Richardson and Daughter
Was Not A one.
TELLTALE TEAIL OF TWO MEN.
A White Horse Tied Near the Villa on
the Night of the Double
Tragedy.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 2.â
There are many who believe to-day that
a man is walking the streets of Santa
Barbara before whose eyes a hangman's
noose Is dangling and in whose ears are
forever ringing the piteous cries of two
murdered women. Already incriminating
circumstances involving him in this crime
are known, and sooner or later, it is be
lieved, the network of evidence will close
its meshes around him and he will meet
4is deserts. This man is now under sur
veillance. His arrest is likely to occur at
any hour.
The tragedy which disturbed Santa Bar
bara's peace less than a month ago is still
fresh in the minds of Cahfornians. Mrs.
Richardson, widow of the late Henry
Richardson and a lady of means, lived
alone with her daughter, Ethel, in a pretty
villa three and a half miles from Santa
Barbara. On Sniaday, the sth of July, they
visitei friends, afterward drivin,* to the
cemetery, half a mile below them, to in
struct the sexton to permit the body of a
friend's child to be temporarily interred
in their own lut.
They returned home about dusk to their
large, lonely house, standing in an open
space fronting the sea, their nearest neigh
bors being the Wallen family, residing
about an eighth of a mile distant. The
next morning Ethel Richardson's body,
almost nude and pierced with bullet
wounds, and with a deep gaÂ«h in her
throat, was found lying in the stubble
field below the house, and on breaking the
house open Mrs. R.chardson was found,
bathed in her own bood, on the threshold
of her chamber. She died the following
day, without regaining consciousness. No
valuables had been taken from the uouse,
the dead women's jewelry, consisting of
watches and trinkets ot considerable value,
being undisturbed and lying m plain
sight.
Back of a cowshed in a corner of the
grounds on the main highway the prints
of two men's shoes were found. Passing
partly around the house was the print of
the girl's bare feet, as she ran from her
pursuers. This little footprint was traced
down the driveway to the main entrance,
where a low chain closed the entrance.
Over this the girl sprang or climbed, evi
dently trying to reach the houses
of neighbors. The prints of the smaller
man's feet, far apart, followed bers down
this drive a short distance, when he sud
denly turned and went toward the four
strand plain wire fence surrounding the
grounds and climbed it, leaving blood on
two of the wires.
Directly opposite these bloody wires,
and a rod or so back from the gateway
and directly away from the course she was
taking to reach the neighbors, the girl was
murdered. There were no evidences oi
her having been dragged to this place, but
on the contrary, the print of her foot was
discerned in the stubble leading to it, and
it is piain that for some region, which no
one has been able to determine and which
he Coroner'a jury did not even attempt t o
ascertain, she changed her course alter
crossing the chain and ran directly toward
her murderer. Who had blocked the path
way that would have led her to protectors
and safety? Wuo was the second man
who left telltale footprints on the grounds?
Fewdouot that Cyrus Barnard, who was
killed at his cottage on Garden street while
resisting arrest as a suspect, had some
thing to do with the crime, though there
were many things in his favor which could
not be explained. He bad been seen a
long distance from the villa shortly before
the murders were committed; the bloody
clothing left by the assassin couid not be
identified as a portion of Barnard's ward
robe. Yet other evidence seemed so con
clusive that public opinion views the kill
ing of Barnard as the vengeance of Provi
dence.
It is now almost a certainty that Bar
nard had an accomplice. That accom
plice may have commuted tne murders
while the man now dead stood by, a cow
ardly and appalled spectator. Senor
Romero, the Caiifornian who has, since
the day of the murder, been the custodian
of the Richardson bouse and grounds,
states that Ayala and his wife, who testified
to having seen and accosted Cyrus Barnard
at 9 o'o.ock on the ni^ht of tne muraer,
also r marked a white horse attached to
an open ouggy and hitched to the fence
along tiie road opposite the RicLardson
barn. No one lives on the other side <;f
this road in that vicinity. No one wouid
hitch a horse there at that time of night
unless on a visit to the Richardson place.
Yet if they had any visitors that time of
nieht that fact has been sedulously con
cealed.
Had Barnard hired or borrowed this
horse testimony concerning it would long
ago have been forthcoming. Some one is
inteesteu :n coneeauug the fact that the
white horse was out ttiat night. The man
now under suspicion was seen in Barnard's
company on the day of the murder, but
when questioned afterward he positively
denied that he had seen Barnard on that
day ani! -ince then he has kept guardedly
in the bacK^round.

STOCKTON BOY KILLED.
Struck by an Electric Car While Trying to
Steal a Ride Into the
City.
STOCKTON, Cax-, Aug. 2.â Eddie
Condy, the twelve-year-old son of Street
Contracter Condy of this city, was run
over by an electric car and killed this af
ternoon. For the past three or four weeks
the conductors and motormen have been
annoyed by a party of youngsters who
stay near North street and try to steal
rides into the city. To-day was not an ex
ception, and Eddie Condy was one of
those who were trying to steal a ride on an
incoming car. The. conductor tried to
reach him, but the nimble yonth evaded
him a number of times. The conductor
warned him and told the boy that he was
liable to get hurt in jumping on and off
the car, as he had been doing in trying to
dodge the street-railway man, but the
youngster paid no heed to the admoni
tion.
Condy failed to see car No. 19 that was
on the way out to Goodwater Grove
crowded with people, and stepped from
the incoming car as No. 19 came along.
He was out on the right hand track be
fore Motormau Grider saw him and then
it was too late to cheek the car.
The front of the swiftly- moving electric
car struck young Condy in the back,
knocking him down, bruising him about
t.p head and breaking his arm. He was
picked up unconscious and the next car
carried him back to Stockton. The boy
died soon afterward from the internal in
juries he had received.
FRESNO RIGHTS Of WAY.
Committees on Riral Routes Working to
Secure the Valley Road.
FRESNO, # Cal., Aug. 2.-C. 8. Yonng
and W. C. Edes of the San Joaauin Valley
Railway Company were in conference
yesterday with committees on rights
of way on the Reed ley route. As the rail
road company has agreed to build the
road over a route, either by way of Han
ford or Reedley, along which landowners
first offer right of way, the committees
along the two surveys are working very en
ergetically. So far the Hanford route is
ahead, the committees claiming that they
will be able to offer free right ot way with
in thirty days.
The committee on the Reedley route
have been less successful, but are doing
everything in their power to get the road.
Grading to Fresno will be finished in two
or three weeks and they fear if they are
not successful in procuring rights of way
by that time, so that work can proceed,
the grading outfits will be moved away
and the road will not be continued south
ward this season.
The most difficulty over the right of way
is experienced between Fresno and Reed
ley. Right of way through Tulare County
has nearly been obtained.

While It Engages Her Assailant ShÂ«
Sends a Bullet Through
Bruin's Heart
MARSHFIELD, Ob., Aug. 2. â Miss
Jeannette Rose of Randolph, 17 years old,
is the heroine of that locality because of
her brave encounter with a big blacfc bear
Friday afternoon. She was strolling in an
unfrequented place in the woods near
home, carrying a rifle with which she was
shooting rabbits and birds, when she cams
upon a bear cub. Without counting upon
the consequences, Miss Rose shot at the
little fellow. With the crack of herrifla
the cab fell, wounded and squealing,
and then, to the astonishment of
the huntress. Mother Bruin appeared
on the scene and took a hand in the affair.
The bear made a savage rush at Miss
Rose, who retreated with her face to thÂ«
beast, at the same time tiring several
shots at her assailant. The infuriated
bear reached Miss Rose with one of its
paws, striking her to the ground. For
tunately she was accompanied by a small
pet dog, which, instinctively realizing ita
mistress' danger, began snapping at the
bear.
This distracted the enraged animal's
attention before it had done more harm*
than to break the girl's collar-bone and
bruise her face.
While the bear was making sad havoc
of the brave little dog, Miss Rose arose
and fired again and the bullet pierced
bruin's heart. Exhausted and bleeding,
she succeeded in reaching home and're
lated her adventure. Relatives went to
the scene of the encounter and there
found the carcasses of the bear, the dog
and the cub, which had died from its
wound.
It is proposed to send Miss Rose and
the stuffed hides of her ame to the Port
land Exposition next month, where the
heroic girl will prove a great attraction.

DEATH BRAVED FOR RICHES.
A Mining Camp Springs Up at Once
in the Vicinity of tbe DisÂ»
covery.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Aug. 2. -The
story has already been told briefly of the
latest wonderful discovery of gold on the
Mojave Desert; but only the bare bones of
the romance (fur it is a veritable romance)
have been presented to the public. The
account as previously telegraphed was that
two prospectors, wandering far from set
tlement or habitation on the superheated
hands of the desert during the recent hot
spell, when in the settled valleys deaths
from heat were numerous, and even that
iabled individual, the "oldest inhabitant,"
could not call to mind such another "spell
of weather," had by merest accident stum
bled upon a fortune in the shape of a ledge
of gold-bearing rock of almost incredible
richness.
These men, Dronillard and Pyle by
name, being practically without means,
naturally loosed about for some method
of recuperating their fortunes. Stories of
the good luck that had belalleu other men
situated like themselves, and who had
pone to the desert mining camps, reached
their ears, and they decided that what
others had done they also conld do.
Neither had even the small amount of
wherewithal to obtain the outfit, without
which it were worse than useless to ven
ture desert ward. A brother of one of the
partners was consulted, and promptly
f#lunteered to do what is known as the
"grub-stake act." In other words he
agreed to fnrni^h what was necessary for
the trip, in return for an equal Bha;e in
whatever discoveries might be made.
Equipped then for the hardships and
dangers for a desert trip in July the two
partners started for the Mojave, with a de
termination to exhaust every effort in the
search for a paying mine. As lucji would
have it they started just at the commence
ment of that hot wave which for three
Jong, weary weeks held the interior val
leys in its liery grasp and sent to death
more human beings and animals than the
newspapers have cared to publish.
But such a drawback as 123 degrees,
more or less, in the shade and up to 150 in
the sun, could not daunt these two pros
pectors. They pushed uir-ir way out on to
the Mojave Desert to the recently estab
lished camps fifty to sixty miles northeast
of Mojave. Then they began their in
quiries. Had such and such a locality
â  been prospected? Yej, and some good
mines found. Well, we don't want to go
there. Another locality? The same
answer. Another? Still the same reply.
Finally, How about that region? Oh,
that's been prospected high and low and
never a sign or a color found. That's the
place for us. That's what we are looking
forâ and toward it th?y headed. They
made camp at the only water iv the region
and then started to prospect the entire
locality thoroughly.
Each day they filled their canteens and
uiru prospector's pick in band started
out, hopeful tbaterethe thrice-heated sun
fell below the blue hills in the west some
discovery would reward their efforts. The
heat was something awful. Nothing like
it had ever been known in that region,
and all who could tied to the mountains or
tho seashore.
But the partners persevered. Two weeks
in this earthly inferno passed and still no
discovery to reward them. But this did
not cau^e them to lo3e heart. They had
gone to the desert with a definite object
and they proposed to accomplish that o>
â¢ ject or die in the attempt.
On the first day of the third weekDrouil
â¢ lard started out alone and in a different
â¢ direction lrom any in which he had previ
ously gone, fcome one who claimed to be
acquainted with the country told him
where there was a spring in the direction
iri which he proposed going where he
could find abundance of water. Very care
lessly, but quite naturally, he put faith in
these instructions, took" the Dearings of
the presumed spring carefully and started
out with what he supposed was water
enough in his canteen to snrfice until the
spring could be reached. Having full faith
in the directions given, he did not bus
band his supply cf water as he might
. otherwise have done, but drank freely
whenever thirsty. The result was that his
canteen was empty long before he reached
the spot where he expected to obtain a
fresh supply of water. Some time passed
after the last drink had been taken before
he reached the spot where the.spring was
supposed to be. When Drouiliard arrived
at the hoped-for locality at last he found
where the spring had been, but not a drop
of water was there. It had vanished,
evaporated completely, and not so much
as a sign of moisture remained. The un
usually hot weather had dried up every
drop of what had been a fairly abundant
supply.
Now the pangs of thirst which had as
sailed the prospector for the last two hours
were redoubled. The very knowledge that
there was no water to be had made him
ail the more thirsty. His parched mouth
became still more parched, and he would
have given anything in the world for a
draught even of the most brackish water.
He sought in every direction for another
spring, but in vain. Not a sign of water
could be found anywhere.
While looking for the precious fluid,
half blinded with the heat and glare and
haif mad with the torments of thirst, he
stumbled over some "float," which his ex
perienced eye told him at a glance was a
good indication of the proximity oi a
ledge of quartz. Even his thirst did not
deprive him of the desire which had
promoted the trip, and, half uncon
sciously almost, he abandoned the search
for water and followed up the float, deter
mined to find its source, even if it were the
last thing he did. He had not far to go.
Perhaps 500 yards he traveled, led on all
the while by the increasing quantities of
float, and then suddenly he came to the
ledge which was its origin. At the point
where he struck it the soil was nearly
level and the quartz projected perhaps a
couple of feet above the surface. A glance
showed him that it was beautiful "live"
rock. Then a blow with his pick and a
piece was broken off and piclced up for
examination. That was enough; he had
found what he sought.
All across the fracture the bright yellow
metal glittered in the sun, a mass of wire
work, held together by a spongy formation
of half-decomposed quartz, dark red in hue
and contrasting handsomely with the
treasure in irs grasp. Almost half gold
was the fracroent of rock. Another and
yet another piece were broken off, and all
with the same result. The ledge was fol
lowed some distance, and still the rock
wherever broken off showed up rich with
gold. It was a bonanza !
To use Drouillard's own words: "I was
no longer thirsty!" Only a man who has
actually experienced a desert thirst can
realize what this means. Think of the
most acute bodily discomfort one ever ex
perienced, increase it a hundred-fold, then
have something transpire which drives
that discomfort, even the memory of it,
from one's mind like a Hash, and he can
perhaps have a faint realization of the sen
sations of the lucky prospector over his
find.
As soon as he realized what he had dis
covered Drouillard saw that the iedee
cropped out for a long distance in both
directions. He at once put up a monu
ment and notice of claim, and then started
for camp. Five mortal hours he went
without water. Five hours without a
drink of water? Pshaw, most of us do
that every day and think nothing of it.
But out on tue desertâ hot, dusty, shade
less, cloudless, with the fierce July sun
beating down with a fervor which the
cold figures of the thermometer cannot
adequately depict â ah, that is different.
Why, fifteen minutes without a drink is
misery, half an hour torture, two hours
death almost to the man unaccustomed to
the terrible torridity. Yet five long hours
did Drouillard travel with empty canteen
at bis side. The latter portion of the
period he was buoyed up by the glorious
news which he was hastening to impart to
his companion. Had it not been for that
it is doubtful whether he would ever have
reached camp alive. When he did ar
rive he was as near death as one can be
and recover.
The rest of the story is easily told, inas
much as it is but a repetition of what has
occurred hundreds of times. The part
ners went back to the scene of the discov
ery, staked out claims for themselves and
their backers, and then gave the news to
the world. Four claims, making 6000 feet
on the ledge, was their modest limit, and
then the discovery was free for any one.
As soon as the news got out miners from
Red Rock and Mojave, from Goler and
Raudsburg, from Cow Weils and Coyote
Hole, rustied in, and in an incredibly short
time had the country staked out for miles.
The original discoverers traced the crop
pings for a little over a mile and located
it; but oue man has already found crop
pines of similar character pine miles
away and the intervening country has
Oeen pretty nearly all takeu up.
Ore taken from several points on the
ledge shows assays of anywhere from $250
to $'J. r >ooa ton, mostly in gold but with a
fair amount of silver. AW along theledge,
which is three feet in width on the surface,
samples taken at random show the same
wonderful layers and stringers of pure
gold running through the quartz. A small
shipment of 700 or 800 pounds of ore was
taken from the croppings and sent to be
worKed, and trom the assays is expected
to return from $1 to $1 50 per pound in free
gold.
Arrangements are being hurried by the
discoverers for systematically and thor
oughly working the mines, and they re
turned yesterday to the desert from here,
having come in to procure supplies and
make preparations for opening the mines.
The exact location of these newly dis
covered mines is at the southern base of
the raucre of mountains on the northern
slope of which Kandsburg is situated.
They are about ten or twelve miles nearer
Mojave than Randsburg. A dry lake
known as Cuddeback Lake is close by,
and at Cuddeback Wells, four or five miles
distant, is an abundant supply of pure
water. It is believed from indications
that water can be obtained close to the
mines. Rogers Station, on the Santa Fe
Roaa, is about eighteen miles south-south
west of the discovery and is the nearest
railroad point. An old wagon-road from
Mojave passes directly through the local
ity, and the ledge itself shows signs of the
passing and repassing of many vehicles,
yet uever a man thought it worth while to
examine the rock till Drouillard came
along.
Otuer locators on the ledge are finding
rich rock, while dry wasbers are already
at work in several localities along the ledge
and are making good wages.
The report has been circulated that this
is probably the lost Pegleg mine. The
proposition is absurd on its face. The Peg
leg mine is on a direct line between the
Colorado River at about the Needles and
Warner's Pass, away to the southeast
from Los Angeles. It is not more than
three days' horseback ride from Warner's
ransh, and i* a couple of hundred miles or
so from St. Elmoâ the name given the new
camp. ________________
SPIRITUALISTS AT REDONDO.
Second Annual Camp- Meeting of the
Southern California Association.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Ang. 2.â The sec
ond annual camp-meeting of the Spiritu
alists of Southern California was opened
at Redondo to-day. The gathering is one
ot the largest in the history of the organi
zation.
The services began in the morning with
open-air singine, after which Mrs. E.
Browning, president of the Truth-seekers'
Society of Los Angeles, delivered an invo

the flag was raised.
The crowd adjourned to the Auditorium,
where i?. Dye, president of the Camp
Meeting Association of Spiritualists, de
livered the address of welcome. He re
ferred to the conditions and outlooK of the
work now being much more favorable than
when the association was formed three
years aeo.
W. J. Colville of Boston followed with a
few remarks, after which J. R. Peebles of
San Diego spoke. E. K. Hurlburt read an
original poem, which had been written at
4 o'clock iv the morning upon the opening
of the camp-meeting.
Professor E. A. Whitelaw gave several
violin selections. W. J. Colville was again
introduced, and delivered an address on
"The Universal Mission of Spiritualism."
The afternoon session was occupied by
spirit tests, Mrs. D. N. Place of Ban Fran
cisco, and Mrs. Ladd Finnican being the
mediums to interpret the messages. Dr.
Peebles delivered an address in the even
ing and tests were made by Mrs. Wer

Erected in the Past
Year.
COST THE CITY $326,000.
Large Increase in the Number
of Scholars Shown by a
Late Census.
BEST INSTRUCTORS ENGAGED.
High Salaries Are Paid and All
Modern Educational Ideas
Brought Into Us*.
Following is the first of a series
of articles prepared under the super
vision of the three commercial
bodies of Los Angeles â the Cham
ber of Commerce, Board of Trade
and Merchants' and Manufactur
ers* Association â showing the
growth of population and recent
industrial development in that en
terprising city and vicinity.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 2.-Eleven
new schoolhouses, with an aggregate of
101 rooms and accommodations for nearly
5000 pupils; nine old school buildings re
paired and enlarged by the addition of
from two to six rooms, thu9 providing ac
commodations for about 1000 additional
pupils. Such ib the record for one school
year in Los Angeles.
If there is one thing above another
which the wide-awake residents of Los
Angeles are proud of, it is the facilities
afforded by the city for the schooling of
the rising generation. Few cities in the
land are better equipped in this respect,
none have made more rapid strides in this
direction. It is doubtful whether the rec
ord made by Los Angeles in the last school
year in the matter of building school
bouses has ever been equaled by any city
of the same size in a like period.
Nothing, perhaps, more forcibly illus
trates the remarkable growth of Los An
geles than the building of so many school
houses in one year. These buildings were
not erected to meet a future want, but to
provide for a present necessity. Although
new buildings were added from time to
time, and the capacity of the schools
doubled several times in the last decade,
the buildings became so crowded last year
that a large increase in facilities for the
proper education of the juvenile popula
tion became imperative. Notwithstand
ing the greatly enlarged accommodations
provided, all the buildingsâ new end old
will be full to overflowing next school
year, and if the growth in population con
tinues at the present rate, it will not be
long before this year's building operations
will have to be repeated.
The last school census shows 20,639
children of school ageâ between 5 and 17
yearsâ in the city, an increase of 3683
over the previous year. This increase is
partially accounted for by the annexation
of suburbs to the city, but most of the in
crease is natural. The total population of
the city, based on the school census, is in
I round numbers 87.000. This is a conserva
tive estimate. The School Census Mar
shal's report for 3890-91 showed a school
population of 11,084. The total popula
tion of the c'ty the same year, according
to the Government census, was a little
over 50,000. The ratio between the scnool
and total population was about 4.2 per
cent. The same ratio applied to the pres
ent year makes the total population 87,000,
as already stated.
The following table, taken from the of
ficial records, tella the story of the city's
growth:

To accommodate all these school chil
dren there are now fifty- four well ap
pointed schooihouses distributed at con
venient distances over the forty odd
square miles of territory which the City
covers. Most of these buildings, espe
cially the new ones, are imposing; edifices
architecturally and are provided with all
the modern conveniences and the latest
improved school furniture and apparatus.
A remarkable thing about the new
schoolhouses is that they were all de
signed by and built under the direct super
vision of Charles L. Strange, City Super
intendent of Buildings, without any addi
tional cost to the City for architect's fees.
By placing the work in his hands ex
clusively the City saved $13,500 in archi
tect's fees alone. This is all the more re
markable taken in consideration with the
fact that the Superintendent of Buildings
had in charge at the same time the de
signing and building of a new central
police station and city jail, besides the
performance of his regular duties as su
perintendent of the unprecedented^ large
amount of private building operations.
The contract price of the eleven school
buildines erected under the superintend
ence of Mr. Strange was $180,000. They
are located as follows: Pico and Sentous
streets, 12 rooms; Temple and Custer
streets, ten rooms; New Macy and A Vila
streets, eight rooms; Cambria and Vernon
streets, eight rooms ; Twenty-first and Nor
wood street, ten rooms; Olive street be
tween Fourth and Fifth, twelve rooms;
Second street, near State, Boyle Heights,
eight rooms; Sixth street, near Maple
avenue, ten rooms; Twenty-eighth and
San Pedro streets, ten rooms; Griffith
avenue, eight rooms; Boyd street, near
San Pedro, five rooms.
The entire outlay for the new buildings,
repairs, additions, furniture, etc., during
the year, exceeded $326,000, the amount of
the bonds floated for this especial purpose.
The total amount of Los Angeles city
school bonds now outstanding is $476,950,
but this is a debt that the citizens of Los
Angeles are not ashamed of. They have
never yet refused to vote bonds for school
purposes when the necessity arose. These
bonds are deemed gilt-edge investments
'and do not have to go begging for pur
chasers. They are promptly redeemed at
maturity. The total value of the city's
school property is estimated at $1,146,650.
The operating expenses of the City
School Department for the school year
ended June 30, 1896, amounted to $297,
-353 48, as against $257,537 46 last year. The
new rear is begun with a balance of
$04,14G 74 in the City treasury accredited
to the common school fund.
In the year 1894-95 290 teachers were em
ployed; in 1895-98 tbe number of teachers
was increased to 377. The schools were
open 9% months. The total enrollment of
pupils in all grades was 16,034. The
average monthly salary paid the 49 male
teachers in the primary and grammar
grades was $93 81; average salary of 328
female teachers In same grades, $76 73.
The average salary of 7 male teachers in
the High School was $125 05 per month,
and of 12 female teachers, $103 64.
Tne High School had an average daily at
tendance during the year of 391 and grad
uated a class of 71. "This is an excellent,
institution, the graduates being prepared
to enter the State University and kindred
institutions. The cost of running the High
School last year was $25,778 15. It occu
pies an elegant building which, with its
furnishing, cost a few years ago $88,000.
The High School is one of the public insti
tutions of the town which the citizens take
special pride in.
It may safely be said that the public
schools of Los Angeles were never in a
more prosperous condition. In buildings,
equipments and efficiency of instructors
they challenge comparison with the
schools of any city in the country.
The corps of teachers employed em
braces some of the best educators in the
State. Most of them are graduates of
training-schools or State normals, and
many of them have been employed con
j tinuously for years by succensive Boards
of Education on account of the efficiency
they have shown.
There is perhaps no section in the Union
which affords better educational facilities
at public expense than Los Angeles City
and County. There are, besides the excel
lent public schools and the State Normal
School, located here a number of private
schools, both secular and parochial. The
children in attendance at these private
schools during the last school year num
bered 1052. This is exclusive of the stu
dents enrolled in seminaries, business col*
leges and institutions for higher education,
of which there are quite ft few, some of ex
cellent reputation.
Patriotism is taught in all the public
schools of the city, and "Old Glory" floats
over every schoolhouse while school is in
[ session. Many people considered school
children's day atthe late fiesta, when 10,000
boys a>)d girls, bedecked with flags and
garlands, marched in parade and partici
pated in flag-raising exercises, the most
successful day of the entire festival.
If schoolhouses are the country's fort
resses, then Los Angeles needs no other
defenses. She is as well fortified as any
city in the country.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 2.-The re-
cent flooas have covered the Dewdney
ranches with a most peculiar substance
apparently unknown to scientific men.
The water has receded and apparently
blanketed the low-lying farms. This pe
culiar substance will absorb water like
blotting paper, but will apparently not
dissolve in water. It resembles Chinese
paper, but completely shuts out the light
and all vegetation beneath it dies accord

"ENTIRE BUTTS"
The Origin of a Malt Beverage That Be
came the Favorite of Thirsty Souls.
Plenty of people imagine this on public
house signs to signify a monopoly of sup
ply from one brewery ; but it is really the
old name of what is called "porter." The
following history of its origin may be ac
ceptable:
It appears that in the early days of last
century the lovers of malt liquors in Lon
don were accustomed to regale themselves
upon three classes of these beverages; they
had ale, beer and twopenny. Many who
preferred a more stubtle combination of
flavors than either of these liquors alone
could iaa part would ask for half-and-half â
that is, half of ale and half of beer, half of
ale and half of twopenny, or half of beer
and half of twopenny.
Others, again â and these were the real
connoisseurs of malt liquorsâ would call
for a pot of three 'threads,' or three
thirds â i. c., one-third of ale, one-third of
beer and one-thira of twopenny. The
drawer would therefore have to go to three
different casks and through three distinct
operations before he could draw a pint of
liquor. But the hour had comeâ and the
man. One Ralph Harwood, whose name
is too little known to an ungrateful pos
terity of beer-drinking Britons, some time
about the year 1730 kept a brewhouse on
the east side of High street, Shoreditch.
In that year, or perhaps a little earlier,
as this great man brooded over the incon
venience and waste occasioned by the calls
for the l: three threads," which became
more and more frequent, he conceived the
idea of making a liquor which would com
bine in itself the several virtues of ale,
beer and twopenny. He carried the idea
into action and brewed a drink which he
called "Entire," or "Entire Butts." It was
tasted; it was approved ; it became the
fruitful parent of a mighty offspring, and
from that day to this has gone on increas
ing in name and fame. â Notes and Queries.
Wlien Flying Machines Work.
"Sooner or later the inventive genius of
Professor Langley or of Maxim will solve
the flying machine problem and give us
aerial navigation," said Dr. Henry D.
Zellars of Boston at the Hotel Page. "But
the chances are that even if they succeed
in their efforts only a portion of mankind
will care to make excursions through the

the flying habit would become universal.

take to cycling. So it is that even if a
first-rate flying ojevice is perfected there
will be millions of people who will fail to
use it. But I think that we shall see
people sailing through the air in the next
decade, for I have great faith in the prac
ticability of the idea and in the men who
are striving for its development." â Wash

PRACTICE MARCH,
Preparing for a Seven
Days' Tramp to Santa
Cruz.
FOURTH CAVALRY DUTY.
Good Work in Protecting Forests
of the Sierra Re
gion.
THE BERKELEY BATTALION.
Lieutenant Winn, U. S. A., Expects
a Large Enrollment of
Students.
The practice march of the First United
States Infantry to Santa Cruz and return
Is now the talk of the garrisons at Angel
Island and Benicia. Official orders for the
expedition may be Issued in a day or two.
The troops on reaching Santa Cruz will
CO into camp at Garfield Park, near the
ocean. The park is connected with Santa
Crnz by an electric railway line.
Seven companies of the regiment, four
from Angel Island and three from Benicia
barracks, will compose the marching col
umn. The infantrymen will not be pressed
to make quick time to Santa Cruz. The
tramp will begin by easy stages and end
pretty much in the same style.
On the march the commissary depart
ment will be well supplied with subsist
ences for the troops, and the farmers on
the route of the expedition will not be re
quired to pat extra guards on their poul
try yards and orchards. The line of march
will be along the worn highway on this
side of the bay to San Jose, and thence
over the Santa Cruz mountains tÂ« the
ocean. The journey can be made in seven
days by marches that will not distress the
troops. On the return march the road
along the ocean shore, Tia Pescadero, will
be followed.
First Lieutenant F. L. Winn, Twelfth
United States Infantry, who is on duty as
military instructor at the University of
California, expects a large enrollment at
the next college term. The War Depart
ment allows a limited number of officers
to be detailed for college instruction, but
it is not possible to comply with all the
college requests for such details. Only the
leading institutions and those in which
military instruction is in a sense compul
sory are recognized.
Lieutenant Winn if anxious that this
line of study should become popular at
Berkeley, and holds that special advan
tages are presented for studies in engineer
ing and artillery. The Governor and Ad
jutant-General nave manifested much in
terest in the military work at Berkeley,
and a proposition to give the battalion at
Berkeley an allowance equal to the regu
lar battalions of the National Guard may
receive the attention of the Legislature.
The fundamental law of the university
requires military instruction but the State
authorities fancy that all the expense
should be sustained by the Government
and the students.
While the cost of procuring uniforms is
Dot large it is an item of some importance
to many of the students. It is possible to
make the battalion at the university quite
as effective and as readily available as any
existing organization of the National
Guard. The opportunity for special in
struction in engineering is afforded at
Berkeley. It is an important study which
cannot be readily pursued at the armory.
At Stanford University military instruc
tion was recognized for a short time, but it
was neglected or abandoned because it was
not a requirement of that institution.
Lieutenant Oyster, U. 8. A., served for a
term as instructor and then at his own re
quest was relieved from the duty.
The light batteries of the Fifth Artillery
have returned from the long practice
march and are now resting at the Presidio.
The expedition was highly successful.
The troops went into the Sierras as far as
the Yosemite Valley and then wired to
Monterey and Santa Cruz.
At Santa Cruz Benjamin H.Barlow.Light
Battery D, was tried by a court-martial
for making threats of violence against a
non-commissioned officer, and was sen
tenced to be dishonorably discharged, to
forfeit all pay and allowances and to be
confined at hard labor for one year. The
court took into consideration that a record
of six previous convictions stood against
the accused.
Surgeon-General Sternberg has returned
to Washington, having made a summer
jaunt across the continent. He completed
a thorough inspection of the hospitals,
and has decided to recommend additions
to the hospitals at the Presidio of San
Francisco and Leavenwortn.
The third athletic field day exercises, in
accordance with orders, recently took
place at Angel Island, and Company C,
First Infantry, carried away the honors
for the third time. In the chief running
events Sergeant O. Marie was the winner.
Tne contractor on the work of filling in
the Presidio marsh has forty teams em
ployed. The ei-rht-hour requirement is
observed. The task should be completed
early In December.
The contractor for building the new
brick barracks has men at work excavat
ing for the foundation. Rock is coming
from the Angel Island quarry and lumber
from Pupet Sound. Mr. McGowan, the
contractor, is not sub-letting any of the
work. The building should be roofed
over by the middle of December.
Captain Lockett, Troop I, Fourth Cav
alry, arrived from Grant Park in the Sierra
last Saturday and had a conference with
General Forsyth concerning the depart
ment. The troopers are guarding the
forests over a vast area of mountain
country.
General Forsyth takes a deep interest
in tiiis line of duty. He has ooserved the
effects of forest destruction in Ohio, Mich
igan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and
knows that if the forests in the Sierra are
destroyed the supply of water for the
valleys cannot be held in reserve for grad
ual distribution throughout the summer.
The trooper? of the Fourth Cavalry are
doing great work for the State.
The leave of absence granted to Captain
Henry J. Reilly, Fifth Artillery, has been
extended fifteen days.
Lieutenant William R. Smedberg,
Fourth Cavalry, has been relieved from
duty with the squadron of his regiment,
near Wawcna, to enable him to proceed to
Went Point, in accordance with order*.
Colonel Guenther, U. S. A., who was re
cently promoted, returned from Honolulu
last week. He goes East to take command
at Washington Barracks.
Furloughs have been granted to Sebas

Miss Walter has held the position of
matron at the hospital for the past fire
years and la muoh liked by patients and

"There has been no trouble of any
kind," she said when seen last night at
the hospital. "I have been here for five
years, and after the hard work I have done
I feel the need of a rest. Of course, I have
had some disagreeable experiences just as

PACIFIC CRICKETERS WIN,
In a Close Contest They Defeat
Alameda by Just Six
Runs.
California-Bohemia Match at Golden
Gate Results in a Walkover
for Bohemia.
Those who congregated at the Alameda
Cricket ground yesterday to witness the
contest between the Alameda and Pacific
clubs looked for a close game. Their ex
pectations were fully realized for, amid a
storm of applause, one of the most inter
esting matches of the season terminated
in favor of the Pacifies by half a dozen
runs.
Winning the toss Captain Hogue of the
Alamedas sent his opponents in. The first
few wickets fell with alarming rapidity,
Wise and Pocock being the only men to
make anything of a stand.
Then George Wiseman, on whom there
is no figuring, took center and proceeded
to do yeoman service. He carried the bat
for a well earned 48, which contribution to
the side's total of 124 was the feature of
the game.
Then the Alamedas went in, headed by
their veteran chief, Randall. Before he
succumbed to one of Richardson's best the
former aggregated a formidable 47. Two
w ickets fell for 60 and the hopes of their
antagonists fell at the outlook. Then
Ward toed the crease and soon showed
that he was in to score, which he did to
the amount of 81 runs.
The excitement reached its zenith when,
at the fall of the ninth wicket, only eight
runs were needed to pass the Pacific's
score. Two of these were niadfl, when H,
Bird sent up a skyer, which Richardson
secured, and the game was over. The
fielding on both sides was smart. The
scores :

Meanwhile the Bohemians were engaged
in defeating the Californias at Golden
Gate. Although they succeeded in t. is
effort, the weaker side made an excellent
fight and their 89 runs, mainly contributed
toby Townsley, Van Norden ana Jones,
was, considering the bowling, a very cred
itable performance.
The conquering team was chiefly in
debted to Doc Bowhiil, who put , together
57 with his usual careful play to Potter,
Reeves and the ever reliable Captain Rob
ertson. They came out ahead by over a
century. The full scores were as follows:

When the report of the committee on
resolutions was presented the convention
was plunged into a heated discussion on
the money question, in which several
delegates participated. There was but one
â¢"livision of opinion, and that was over the
propriety of considering money only as
time checks.
The resolutions, as follows, on the so
cialistic attitude toward money were
almost unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That the Socialist Labor party of
San Francisco, in convention assembled, repu
diate the capitalist party issues of both gold
and silver as a factional fight between the ex
ploiters of labor for the lion's share 01 the in
dustrial spoil of the competitive system; and
be it further
Jiesolved, That we hereby call upon all wage
earners in mines, mills, farms, factories, camps
and counting-houses to come out from amon?
the exploiters of labor, letting their capitalist
masters pull their own political chestnuts
irom the tire of their destruction and wage a
battle for class emancipation and the co
operative commonwealth.
For the arrest of a socialist speaker on the
street and subsequent fine ol $5 by Police
Judge Joacbimsen the convention adopted
a resolution condemning the police
and the Judge, and protesting that it was
a violation of the right of free speech.
The following resolution was adopted:
Whereas, The! Socialist LaDor party is unal
terably opposed to all fusion and entangle
ment with other political bodies, be it
Resolved, That nominees of this convention
publicly refuse the indorsement of any other
political party or organization.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Socialist Labor party of
San Francisco, in municipal convention as
sembled, indorse the action of the Socialist
Trades and Labor Congress recently assembled
in London, England, in excluding the anarch
isms from its deliberations; and, also, in favor
ing the abolition of war and the disband
ing of standing armies, .and that all interna
tional misunderstandings be adjusted by an
international board of arbitration.
The question of the arrests for speaking
on the Htieets was discussed at length and
as a result it was decided to hold a mass
meeting next Saturday night at Seventh
and Market streets to protest against this
interference with the socialist speakers. A
resolution wa3 adopted to the effect that
defendants demand trial by iury. Oliver
Everett, William Costly and C. H. Davies
were appointed a committee to take charge
of all arrests of members, particularly in
regard to protests before the Police Com
missioners.
The convention adjourned sine die after
singing the "Marseilles."

ST, PAUL'S NEW
HOUSE OF WORSHIP
It Will Be a Structure of
Rare Architectural
Beauty.
WORK ALREADY BEGUN.
The Sacred Meeting Place Will
Cost Complete Something
Over $15,000.
EISTOEY OF THE ORGANIZATION
Bishop Nichols Will Officiate at the
Laying of the Cornerstone
August 23.
In a few weeks, probably not later than
September 15, the congregation of St.
Paul's Church, California street, near
Steiner, will be ushered into a new house
of worship, an edifice of rare architectural
design and beauty.
Work on the new structure has been in
progress for some time, but so quietly
have the trustees proceeded that but few
outside of those directly concerned knew
that such a move was contemplated. Al
ready the framework is in position, and on
August 23 tne cornerstone will be laid.
Bishop Nichols will officiate on that occa
sion.
The front wall of the new church will be
built of red stone with gray trimmings.
The remaining walls are to be constructed
of wood heavily braced with iron. The
interior will be finished in redwood and
pine. The seating capacity of the audi
torium will be 600.
The two choir stalls are so designed as
to hold forty extra seats, making the total
seating capacity of the church about 640.
Back of the stalls is the chancel thirty-two
feet deep, and to the right of this is the
vestry. When completed the new St.
Paul's will be one of the handsomest and
best equipped houses of worship in the
City.
St. Paul's Church was organized twenty
two years ago, the late William Dutton
serving one year as lay reader. Dr. Mc-
Elroy assumed charge of the parish in
1875. He was followed in a few years by
Rev. Mr. Neals, and he in turn was suc
ceeded by Rev. Mr. Mynard, now in charge
of St. John's Ciiurch^ Oakland. Mr. My
hard continued as rector until two years
ago, when he was called to the city across
the bay.
The present rector, Rev. W. M. Reilly,
was then called. He saw at once that St.
Paul's could nÂ«.ver hope to become a big
church in point of numbers unless it had
a more commodious building. Such a
thing had been talked of for ten years, but
nobody ever seemed just willing to under
take the work. Nothing daunted, Mr.
Reilly began an energetic crusade for a
new church, with the result tnat three
months auo the trustees passed a resolu
tion authorizing such a structure as would
meet the demands of the times. The
building complete, as now designed, will
cost $15,000.
The old church has been moved to the
rear, and will be utilized as a Sunday
school-room and meeting-place. The
beautiful window in the old church dedi
cated to the memory of Dr. McElroy will
be placed in the chancel of the new build
ing. An effort will be made to place by
its side one in memory of Rev. Dr. Neals,
who served the church faithfully and weli.
Messrs. Rulofson, E. Selfridge, Wheat
and Wallace, with the rector, have been
appointed a committee to perfect all ar
rangements for the laying of the corner
stone.
Old Dutch, Japanese gray, old English,
antique and green oaks and mat gilts are the
latest in picture frames. Some pictures look
well in wnite and gold, and others are correct

MR, MOINAHAN'S
MONKEY-SHINES,
They Won a Ball-Game
for the San Francisco
Team.
A TEN-INNING CONTEST.
Excellent Showing Made by Most
of the Players Who
Participated.
EIGHT TO SEVEN THE SCORE.
Costly Errors by Two of Their Out.
fklders Lost the Game for
the Imperials.
There was a game of ball worth going
miles to see played at the Folsom-street
grounds yesterday afternoon. For nine
innings the San Franciscos and the Impe
rials played as though their lives depended
on the result, but struggle as they would,
neither could obtain a decided advantage
over the other. At the end of the seventh
inning the score stood 7 to 7, and from
then until the tenth inning not a run was
scored.
At the beginning of the extra inning
Monahan, formerly of the Pacifies, "Poo
bsh" Blake's latest addition to his coterie
of local talent, stepped to the bat. Pitcher
Kelly wasted two chances trying to fool
the little infielder. Then Kelly tried with
a straight ball and missed the rubber.
Monahan skipped to the other side of the
plate, and before Kelly realized what he
was about Monahan had got his base on
called balls. Monaban's monkey-shines
beat the Imperials. He got around to
third on outs by Sweeney and Murphy,
and scored on Leonard's safe hit.
In the last half of the tenth the Im
perials went out in one, two, three order.
The San Franciscos and the Imperials
are very evenly matched, and the game
they put up yesterday was as good as any
one could ask. Both sides batted well
and, barring Krug's two fumbles at short,
the fielding was far above the average.
Pete Sweeney seems to be regaining hia
old-time form and put up a game at third
that it would be hard to duplicate any
where. Not a single error was made by
the Imperial inheld, and, in fact, but two
were chargeable to the entire team.
Nealon and Crowley each dropped a fly
ball, and in both cases the error was inex
cusable and costly.
The San Franciscos were first at bat, and
they earned a run in the first inning.
Smith was the initial batter and lined out
a single over the shortstop's head. He
got to second on Krug's out and scored on
Monaban's single. The Imperials in their
half saw the one and went it two better.
Nealon hit safely, Bliss flew out, Green
got a base on balls and Creamer got to
first on a missed third strike, tilling the
bases. Beckett lined out a two-bagger and
the three men scored. Cunningham and
Muller struck out.
In the second inning, after one out,
Leonard got a base for being hit by a
pitched ball. Scott hit safely. Cooney
went out on an infield hit. Smith rapped
out a long fly to center, which Nealon
dropped, and Leonard scored. But for the
error it would have been three out and the
side retired. As it was, Krug, the next
man up, made a three- bagger, scoring
both Scott and Smith. Nealon's error,
therefore, cost just three runs. The Im
perials tied the score the same inning on
a single by Kelly and a double by Bliss.
In the fourth each team scored one.
Frisco's tally was the result of Scott's
tripie and Smith's single. Kelly scored
for the Imperials on his double and Neal
on's single.
In the fifth Monahan was hit by a pitched
ball. Sweeney sent a fly to short right,
which Crowley muffed, thereby losing a
chance for a certain double play, for Mona
han was past second base when he dropped
the ball. Murphy forced Sweeney at sec
ond. Leonard hit safely, scoring Mona
han. Scott followed suit, and Murphy
tallied. Cooney struck out, and Leonard
was caught napping at second. Crowley's
error cost two runs.
In the seventh the Imperials tied the
score on a base on balls and a triple by
Bliss.
From that time on the Imperials failed
to get a man around the bases, and how
Monahan scored the winning ran has al
already been told.

The Stocktons Win.
It had been expected that a game would
take place between the Stockton team and
the All-California team from San Fran
cisco, but at the last moment the arrange
ments failed. When it was found that
the All-California team could not come,
Manager Campbell of the Stockton team ar
ranged to play the Call team here and they
came on short notice. The pitcher of the
visiting nine threw his arm out early in
tne game and the Jocal men did not have
any trouble to find the ball after that.
Lockhead of Stockton pitched a star game
and held the visitors down to three runs.

Extravagant Prices for Their
Schoolbooks. Although Urged
to Join the Book-Dealers'
Combine to Keep Up the
Prices, We Refused to Do So.
The School Book War Is On.
THE EMPORIUM starts the
Schoolbook War to-day. As we
positively refused to join the book-
sellers' combine to keep up the
former high prices, we are in for it.
We shall sell School Books for

We are here to help the people .
of this City to live cheaper and
better than ever before, and to live
ourselves.
We shall sign no agreements to
keep up prices. We shall at all
times sell goods just as low as they
possibly can be sold. If we sell
more merchandise than other mer-
chants who stick to high prices, it
simply shows that the people ap-
preciate what the EMPORIUM is
doing for San Francisco.
Remember, WE inaugurate the

AN ARCHBISHOP'S ADVICE
Moat Reverend Redwood of New Zea
land Talks of the Salvation of
the Soul.
The Most Reverend Archbishop Red
wood, S. M., of Auckland, New Zealand,
preached yesterday forenoon in Notre
Dame dcs Yictoires, the French Catholic
church on Bush street, near Stockton. His
subject was "Salvation of the Soul."
Father Gente, S. M., pastor of the church,
acted as celebrant of the mass, while the
Archbishop himself was assisted by
Bishop-elect Broyer, 8. M., of Samoa and
by the Rev. Larkin, S. M., who together
with the Rev. M. Rousselon, S. M., and
thirty-six altar- boys were present in the
sanctuary during the services.
The church was beautifully decorated
with Mowers, and as a special compliment
to the Archbishop, who is a proficient
violinist, a violin solo was included in the
music.
Archbishop Redwood is neither an ora
tor nor an elocutionist. He is just a plain,
forceful, common-sense speaker whose
charm is in the simplicity of his language,
in the evident sincerity oi his utterances.
He divided his discourse into two partsâ
the value of the soul ; the means of salva
tion.
The soul, he said, is what makes the
man. It will not perish; it is immortal,
and in that particular it is like God. The
salvation of the soul is the most impor
tant business any one can have to do in
this world. Money-making, the pursuit
of health, notning can be compared with
it. It is a personal business. No one can
save another's soul for him; he must at
tend to that himself. God made us with
out our consent; he will not save us with
out our consent.
A business once lost may be recovered
or revived or substituted by another. A
soul once lost is lost for ver.
The means of salvation consists in
prayers, frequenting the sacraments and
keeping the commandments of God and of
the church.
The Archbishop will say mass every
forenoon tnis week from 11:30 to 12 o'clock
in the French church.

THE CALL i PEAKS FOR ALL.
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
FOB PRESIDEN'T-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOR VICF-PREBI DENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EI-KCTION NOVEMBER 3, 1898.
Never trust a fool with lire, business or
govern ment.
The lumbermen join the woolmen in
their opinions of free trade.
The more the people think about freo
trade the more they think of protection.
Ask the raisin-grower what he thinks of
free trade ana you will get wisdom in large
chunks.
Protection Democrats had better drop
the Jast word from the title this year and
take a better name.
Every speech of McKinley promises
prosperity, while Bryan threatens a panic
and financial disaster.
No Republican has a good reason for
bolting this year and no Democrat a good
reason for not bolting.
As there must be work before there are
wages, so there must be protection before
we begin to deal with the money question.
The Democratic bogyman has frightened
business a little, but as soon as the elec
tion is over the trade revival will be im
mense.
It is hard for the business Democrat to
stay with his party when the party refuses
to stay with any business proposition
whatever.
Let it not be forgotten by any voter
that the Republican party is pledged to
woman suffrage in California and must
make it win.
It is pleasant, of course, to know it is a
walk-over, but all the same it is a pity we
cannot hurry it up a little and get through
with the job.
Every one interested in the advance
ment of the industries of California will
be gratified Dy the privilege of voting for
Clans Spreckels as a Presidential elector.
Senator Burrows says the Chicago ticket
is like a bumble-bee, which makes the
roost noise when it is first hatched, and
there is a whole lot of comfort in the
thought.
By the time the Democrats get the mud
die between Sewall and Wat3on straight
ened out the Populists will have recovered
their sense and gone back to the middle
of the road.
When the thinking people of this coun
try get time to read the Chicago platform
in full and think it over at leisure the last
chance of Bryan will vanish from the face
of the earth.
The renomination of Mr. Loud assures
Mr. Kelly that his dirty linen will be
washed in the Fifth District by a tidal
wave, and he will find it waiting for him
up Salt River.
Even silver Democrats hesitate to accept
a platform that denounces the Supreme
Court or to support for the Presidency a
man of no business experience or politi
cal responsibility.
Let us restore prosperity to our indus
tries, put our idle capital into enterprise
and our idle men at work, and then it will
be easier to see exactly what the money
problem is and how best to settle it.
The only way to bring about interna
tional bimetallism is to put the Govern
ment of this country into the hands of
men who know how to govern and who
will have weight and influence in dealing
with European nations.
The personal factor can never be elim
inated from practical politics, and the con
trast between the splendid character of
McKinley and that of his opponent will
determine the way in which many a patri
otic voter will cast his ballot.
Those who vote for Bryan must vote for
the whole Chicago platform, including
free trade, the attack on the Supreme
Court and the denial of the right of the
Federal Government to protect Federal
property when threatened by riots.
The Galveston Xews bolts the Chicago
ticket and declares that to label it Democ
racy is as bad as putting a whisky label on
a bottle of benzine; and while the simile is
distinctively Texan, it is good enough in
its way to be appreciated even in this neck
of the wooda.
The main trouble with the country is
that the revenues are not equal to the ex
penses and consequently the Government
has to borrow gold to keep up its credit.
The establishment of a Republican tariff
will remedy that condition of affairs and
at the same time provide work and wages
for the people, so that the Democratic de
pression will be ended and the money
question made much easier of solution.
GROSSLY MISEEPEESENTED.
The Popocrats grossly misrepresent Jef
ferson and Jackson when they declare
that their declaration of principles are in
harmony with the utterances of those dis
tinguished statesmen. Nowhere in the
speeches, proclamations or messages of
Jefferson and Jackson will be found so
I much as an intimation of a principle of
! government that is in accord with what
i the Popocrats are demanding. Andrew
â  Jackson especially was outspoken in his
denunciation of schemes and plans to give
; the country unsouna money, and no doubt
! Jefferson would have been equally so had
! occasion required. Jackson always
thought of the workingman. He knew
the rich could get along until the tide
! changed, no matter how disturbed the
i business situation might be by a flood of
j cheap and fluctuating money, but the man
who worked for daily wages must have a
sound basis for his compensation. He
must have money that is as good on Sat
urday nifcht when he receives his wages
as it was on the preceding Monday morn
ing when he sold his services for the wee k.
Speaking of the effects of unsound and
uncertain money upon the working classes
| President Jackson said: "Engaged from
| day to day in their useful toils they do not
j perceive that although their wages are
! nominally the same or even somewhat
higber'they are greatly reduced in fact by
the rapid increase of a spurious currency
which, as it appears to make money
abound, they are at first inclined to con
sider a blessing. It is not so with the
speculator, by whom this operation is
better understood and is made to contrib
ute to his advantage. It is not until the
prices of the necessaries of life become so
dear that the laboring classes cannot sup
ply their want 3 out of their wages that
! wages rise and gradually reach a justly
I proportioned rate to that of the products
iof their laoor." Does any one suppose
that if Andrew Jackson were alive he
would be found supporting the nominees
of the Chicago convention? The Popocrats
are for a policy of money debasement.
They want quantity without reference to
quality, but Andrew Jackson taught no
i such economic fallacies. He was a sound
money man.
But the Popocrats cannot fool the wage
earners. In every industrial center wage
earners are organizing themselves into
working clubs to aid in electing a man to
the Presidency who represents and stands
| for good money and continuous employ
| ment at satisfying wages. The working
j men of this country know that the enter
prises which Rive them employment are
I intimately connected with the trade and
| commerce of other countries; that the
] business of the commercial world is inter-
I woven and inseparable, and that it must
i have a uniform measure of value as it
I must have a uniform measure of quantity.
Hence it is that pretty much ail wage
earners are for bimetallism on the lines
laid down by the Republican party, which
is international recognition of silver's
parity with gold. The workingmen of the
United States are not like the pauper labor
of China and Japan. They possess good com
mon sense, and therefore they agree with
Thomas Jefferson that "the proportion
j between the values of gold and silver is a
mercantile problem altogether," and that
nations proposing to use gold and silver in
I settling international trade balances murt
i first meet and solve the "mercantile prob-
I lem ."
MIDDLE -OP - THE - ROAD DEMO
CRATS.
That two Democratic tickets will be in
the field there does not seem to be any
reason to doubt. The middle-of-the-road
Democrats will hold a National nominat
ing convention early in September, with
delegates from every State and Territory,
and nominate a candidate for President
and Vice-President, in whom no Populis
tic or free-silver guile can bs found. This
is as it should be. It is of paramount im
portance that there always be two great
political parties in this country. Our sys
tem of government provides that it shall be
conducted by the people through a political
party, and were there not always a strong
party "out" watching the party that ie
"in," it would not be long before the lead
ers of the "ins" would dispense with the
form of holding elections.
The middle-of-the-road Democracy is
the natural opponent of the Republican
party. There is no difference between the
Democratic party proper and the Republi
can party in purpose. The betterment of
the condition of the people is what the
Democratic party strives for, and the Re
publican party strives for the same object,
but they are widely different in their
views as to how best the position of the
peopie, socially and commercially, may be
strengthened, and although experience
for a third of a century or more testifies
that the people prosper when Republican
economic principles prevail in the con
duct of the Government, and that applied
Democratic principles are hurtful to trade
and commerce, the need of the Democratic
party, as a factor in the Nation's political
life, is evident.
It is a self-evident fact that tha combine
between the Populists and the Bryan wing
of the Democratic party must win in No
vember or go to pieces, it could not sur
vive a defeat twenty-four hour 3, and were
it to win it would not survive one admin
istration. Its basic principles antagonize
the spirit and the purpose of the founders
of the Nation at every point, and it will not
listen to the voice of warning. It is not
surprising, therefore, that all true Demo
crats and all true Republicans are of one
mind that the election of Mr. Bryan would
be a National calamity, nor is it surprising
that true Democrats would want to
strengthen the hands of the Republican
party for this one time by nominating a
ticket that would take votes away from
Bryan. To be sure it would be better if
all anti-Bryan Democrats would come out
for McKinley, but the next best thing is to
have their own candidates.
WHAT SAN FRANCISCO NEEDS.
San Francisco is the natural and legiti
mate point for the accumulation and dis
tribution of a large percentage of the inter
national trade and traffic of China, Japan,
Australia and the islands of the Pacific,
but she will continue to.be the natural
j point without the business until the Gov
' eminent at Washington is persuaded to
I make it possible to keep enough first-class
I steamships in comrrissiorc between San
Francisco and the Orient and intermediate
points to accommodate commerce. The
j business men of Australia and Samoa have
I repeatedly given our merchants assur
| ances of a large volume of business if
they would acquire the necessary facilities
for transporting the articles of commerce.
It is admitted that we have the advantage
of Europe in location, but what does that
signify if we have no way of improving it?
Fourteen subsidized steamship lines
ply between Australasia and the trade
centers of Europe, but there is only one
J steamer a month plying between America
and that country. No doubt the 2 per
cent of the trade of Sydney which now
comes this way could be increased to 50
per cent if our Government would give a
bonus of one-quarter the amount that for
eign ships are getting. The trouble is, it
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 1896.
is everybody's business to make San Fran
cisco a great export and import center,
and, generally speaking, what is every
body's business is nobody's business. But
we have commercial and labor organiza
tions possessing ereat influence, and were
they to take hold in earnest, no doubt the
powers that will be at Washington after
March 4, 1897, could be made to see the
importance of a merchant marine of am
ple tonnage sailing regularly between San
Francisco and every trade point on the
Pacific Ocean.
ARE YOU, ME. BRYAN?
For two years, that is to say since he
has been in the employ of the Silver Mine
Owners' Association, Mr. Bryan has in
sisted that the fall in prices and the stag
nation in business is due to the demon
etization of silver and the appreciation of
gold. But before Mr. Bryan hired himself
to the Silver Mine Owners' Association to
lecture on the beauty and stability of a
monetary system built upon an unlimited
issue of silver he was very sure it was the
inventive genius of American mechanics
that caused prices to fall. In a carefully
prepared speech on the tariff question Mr.
Bryan asserted very positively on the floor
of Congress that the fall in prices
was due "to the inventive genius
that has multiplied a thousand times in
many instances the strength of a single
arm and enabled us to do to-day with one
man what fifty men could not do fifty
years ago. That is what brought the
prices down in this country and every
where."
Whether Mr. Bryan's pay as lecturer
for the combine of silver mine owners and
npeculators was enough to justify such a
flop and flat contradiction we do not
know, but the presumption is that
it was. No doubt he sincerely be
lieved what he said when he told
Congress that the great fall in prices
was due to inventive genius, for all the
facts in the case confirm the statement;
but the same state of affairs prevailed
when he engaged to advocate the opening
of the mints to the unlimited coinage of
silver and proclaim that the demonetiza
tion and not inventive genius was the
cause of prices falling, so it is incumbent
upon Mr. Bryan to reconcile these contra
dictory statements before asking the people
to "trust me," as he puts it.
Mr. Bryan should inform the public con
cerning his contract with the Silver Mine
Owners' Association. If be Is still in its
employ and is making the race for the
Presidency in the interest of that combine
the people should know it.
At Jeast he should not protest if the
people believe it to be true in the absence
of any denial on his part. He is just as
enthusiastic now for free silver without
safeguards as he was when he first entered
the employ of the miners' combine, al
though the fact still remains that the fall
of prices is attributable to inventive
genius. Mr. Bryan owes it to the people
to take them into his confidence and tell
them frankly why ho now says that the
fall of prices is the result of the "crime of
1873," when he did not discover that it was
a crime until 1894.
And while Mr. Bryan is explaining the
business connectiou he has with the mine
owers' association he might explain how
it happened that his employers made no
complaint because of the demonetization
of silver until several years afterward â
until the price of silver bullion went be
low par. These are little matters, but as
Mr. Bryan proposes to conduct an "edu
cational campaign" answers to these ques
tions would be well calculated to enlighten
the public on the silver question. As late
as 1893, and only the year before he hired
himself to the Silver Miners' Association
to advocate the free and unlimited coin
age of silver â mark you, unlimited coin
age â he declared on the floor of Congress
that "if the number of dollars increases
more rapidly than the need of dollars âas
it did after the gold discoveries of 1849â
the exchangeable value of each dollar will
fall and prices rise." Evidently there is a
wide difference between Mr. Bryan as the
paid agent of silver mine owners and
Bryan as a teacher of economics. But is
Mr. Bryan still in the employ of the mine
owners' association? That is wnat the
people want to know.
LUMBER UNDER FREE TRADE.
It is shown in yesterday's Call, in the
first of a series of articles, that the Demo
cratic policy of free trade has done great
injury to the lumbering interests of the
country; that the lumbering interests are
the most extensive of any industries in
America, and that the shrewdest opera
tors are embarrassed under Canadian com
petition.
Free trade in lumber was another one of
the hobbies of William Jennings Bryan,
by which he sought to convince the coun
try by speeches in Congress that free trade
would be a panacea for industrial and
commercial ills. Any one who will read
The Call's account of the practical down
fall of lumbering interests under free trade
will conclude that Bryan knew as little
about what could help the lumber men as
he did about what would benefit the
sheep-growers. That is, he knew nothing
about either business.
Without protection the American mar
ket is open to the competition of lumber
from British Columbia, where crown lands
are practically free, where lumber men
have no investments of consequence and
where it is common to hire Chinese and
Japanese labor at so low a price as sixty
cents a day, the workman boarding him
self. Against the competition of goods
made under these circumstances the
American producer is powerless unless he
reduces the wages of his workingmen to
even a lower standard tban that obtaining
in Canada.
The thoughtful student of the times
will reflect as he reads the story of the
ruin wrought by free trade â a blight
wherever it touches. Yet such is the pol
icy of the Democrats, and particularly the
policy advocated by William Jennings
Bryan of Nebraska.

The Loa Banos Enterprise informs its readers
that a hotel containing 100 rooms will shortly
be built at Mercy Hot Springs. The new hotel
company evidently wants things pretty much
its own way, judging from this "warning note"
of the Enterprise: "A proposition that our
hotel men should understand and study on
for their own good is this: Los Banos will be
headquarters for patients from all over the
State, who visit the springs, and such people
are generally good customers and very desira
ble at hotels. The company will run a daily
stage each wav from here to the springs for
the accommodation of the patients. If they
put their rates down as reasonable as possible
on all such customers and not try to charge
'all the traffic will bear,' the company will be
satisfied and let them have the trade; but if,
on the other hand, they do not do this, the
company will probably erect a hotel of their
own here and eccommodate all their cus
tomers."
Milton McWhorter, the pioneer of Fresno
County's oil-fields, has informed the Expositor
that the country around Coalinga is still being
prospected. People are finding new wells and
filing claims every day. The area of territory
so prospectea is quite considerable. The re
ported discovery of oil in the vicinity of
Panoche is verified by Mr. McWhorter. The
Panoche wells are in San Benito County, j
although there are also indications of oil east
of the divide. Mr. McWhorter says he was the
first man on the ground when the Panoche
wells were discovered. He reports that very
few new buildings are being put up at Oil City, I
Coalinga's new rival. It is still a mere camp.
The flow of oil from the wells has been ex
aggerated. Mr. McWhorter sets down thirty to
forty barrels as the utmost yield of any well
likely to be discovered in the belt, but con
siders the supply permanent.
Tuolumne and Calaveras counties will soon
be supplied with new motor energy. A com
munication from Murphys to the Tuolumne
Independent states that "a project is now under
way for the erection of a power plant on the
middle fork of the Stanislaus River, about
eight miles from that place, to supply power to
the mines along the mother lode, in Tuolumne
and Calaveras counties. The owners of the
water-right, Messrs. Linn and Batten of Mur
phys, have had a survey made, and with a
ditch and flume 13% miles long can obtain a
head of 1280 feet, which would be equal to
three horsepower per miner's inch; and the
river will supply 5800 inches of water in the
driest season o { the year, which would mean
17,400 horsepower. By the addition of a reser
voir this could be increased to 20,000 horse
power, and by stepping the voltage up to
20,000 or 30,000 volts any surplus of power
coula be transmitted to Stockton.
"That the projectors mean business can
readily be seen, as they have a complete map
of mines in both counties, showing position of
power plant, have men working on their ditch,
have taken steps to secure a franchise from
Tuolumne County to run power wires aiong
tho public roads where necessary, and have al
ready obtained one from Calaveras County."
The citizens of Modesto are making a strong
pull for the Yosemite Railroad. The company
is suid to be desirous of building from that
city, but to do so would make their road twelve
miles longer than originally contemplated.
The Modesto Herald, in discussing the matter,
speaks as follows: "If the conditions Imposed
are complied with (subscription for $100,000
of bonds, land for buildings and right of way
through the city), the company will not only
make Modesto the terminal, but establish the
machine shop and roundhouse here and make
ihis city the headquarters of Its employes.
The road would cross the Valley road and
thus place us in direct communication with
that line.
"Judge Hewell, representing the Town Trus
tees, has quite thoroughly considered the
proposition, studied the engineer's report and
Is satisfied that the road will pay and that it
will make much business for usâ not for a
year, but for all timeâ and give the town in
valuable advertising. He favors a united
effort to secure these advantages, and as he
is a hard-headed business man his counsel
will carry great weight.
â¢'lf we meet the terms the company will
place engineers in the field within tea days
thereafter and will complete the road to Ben
ton Mills, forty miles from Modesto and oppo
site Coulterville (seven miles distant), within
three months."
According to the Stockton Record, a new
boat, and a fast boat at that, is a certainty on
the San Joaquin. The designers and builders
who have been at work for the California Nav
igation and Improvement Company for the
past three months think they have planned a
craft that in nigh or low water will make rail
road time from here to San Francisco.
Had the San Joaquin River been improved
by the Government as it was expected It would
be, and ns it certainly should be, there would
have been little or no trouble in designing a
boat that would make the time desired, but in
view of the fact that the present generation
of tots In pinafores will be grandfathers and
grandmothers before the Government aids in
land navigation in California, the old line
company has concluded to build a boat for
passenger traffic based upon low - water
draught.
The boat will carry some freight, of course,
but it will be designed for passenger travel
without taking anything else into considera
tion. In all probability the new boat wilt be
of the twin propeller pattern. It will have a
magnificent cabin, a few elegant staterooms, a
bar. restaurant and every convenience that the
modern up-to-date passenger steamer of the
Eastern rivers can boast of.
The idea of the new boat fe to compete with
the Southern Pacific in getting the Valley road
passengers to the bay, at the same time com
fort and convenience will be added to the riae
The old line officials have nothing to say about
the new boat just now, but do not deny that
satisfactory plans have been submitted. To
tell the truth, the old line is about as busy as
it can be with their old boats in the steamboat
war just started. They are carrying all the
freight and passengers the boats will float, but
they will undoubtedly have the fast boat ready
by the time the Valley road has its passenger
trains running.
There is a dearth of dwelling-houses in Sum
merland at present, the town being unable to
furnish shelter to would-be settlers seeking
homes there. The Summerland Advance de
clares that "more houses will have to be built,
and at once. All that is necessary is for some
body who knows a good thing when he sees it
to make a start and the houses will be rtnted
before the foundations are laid."
"Summerland," remarks the same paper,
"lost its opportunity to become a fashionable
and aristocratic resort for retired millionaires
and one-lungers with a hectic flush when it
opened its first oil well, but it will console it
self by doing the next best thing and become
an oil depot and manufacturing town, where
it will be possible for the man with no other
capital thun his hands and his craftsman's
skill and a guarantee of good faith in ths shape
of wife and babies to get a chance to earn a
livelihood."
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
In the whole history of the New York Law
School previous to this year but five women
had received the degree of LL.B. With the
class of '96. however, six out of the 106 gradu

uate of Mills College in this State.
Her name is Mrs. Fanny Hallock Carpenter,
the wife of a prominent young lawyer of New
York. She received high scholastic honors and
Mrs. Fanny Hallock Carpenter, LL.B.
was a general favorite in her class, of which
she was vice-president. Mrs. Carpenter is a

"There is a law in Mexico called 'la ley
fuga,' " said Peter Negro, an old mining man
from Minas Prietas, Mexico, as he sat by a
window in the Baldwin Hotel and watched the
cars and the people come and go ou Powell
street. "It is the runaway law for the execu
tion of murderers. The man is escorted out
into the hills and then he is set free. But all
about secreted In convenient places are armed
men who shoot him down before he can
escape. They do not hang murderers in Mex
ico. Then they dig a hole and bury the man
right where he fell. The whole country is re
markably lawauiding now and this practice
has not been resorted to very lately. There is
little crime, and robbery, except petty thefts,
is almost unknown in my part of the coun
try. Minas Prietas is seventy-five miies from
the port of Guaymas on the Gulf of Cali
fornia, and is fifteen miles from Torres, a
station on the railroad to Guaymas. Every
month I make long trips on horseback, often
with large sums of money, to pay the men
"The money is all in Mexican pesos and I
carry it in saddle-bag% I ride alone thirty or
forty miles through a mountainous country
without any fear of being molested. That is
what I mean by saying there is little crime. It
is known, too, that I carry money. The Presi
dent of Mexico has succeeded somehow in se
curing a condition of peace that cannot be
found anywhere in this country.
"Yes, the Yaqui Indians fight, but I do not
mean them. About three months ago Colonel
F. Privado met the Yaquis at Round Mountain
and there was a regular hand-to-hand fight.
The troops were traveling around the moun
tain one way and the Yaquis happened to be
coming around the other way. Twelve Yaquis
were killed and about twenty were wounded,
not including those that may have been packed
awÃy by their companions. There are still
about seventy Yaquis up In the mountains,
about forty-five miles south of Minas Prietas.
You see the Yaquis used to control the land
along the Yaqui River, a very fertile valley,
and for fifteen years now they have been
breaking out and fighting to get it bacit. WelL
there are just those seventy left.
"Minas Prietas is a settlement of 5500 peo
ple and embraces several mining camps. Eight
months In the year we have the finest climate
in the world; for the other four months it is a
regular holl. The temperature then is 114
and 115 degrees. This year I felt it more than
ever before.
"I would like to see silver go up, but I think
there is too much of it for that. It cannot
rise in value. Mexico is full of silver and
there are more mines than are now known.
Yes, there is money in silver mining. When
you get fifty or sixty ounces of silver and some
gold along with it it pays. I know a man over
on the Yaqni River who is taking out $10,000
to $12,000 a month in silver and gold; per
haps $2000 of it is gold.
"Everything is taken up around Mlnas
i Prietas for miles and a good deal of it is no
J good. The Minas Prletas and the Criston are
j the two big mines. The output of all these
j mines is 300 tons a day right along. All the
mechanics, engineers and foremen are Ameri
cans, although the Minas Prietas is owned by
an English syndicate. The Criston has a shaft
1000 feet deep and is running two millsâ one
a forty-stamp and the other a thirty-stamp. It
is owned by a Cleveland (Ohio) company."

"WOMEN DO NOT WANT TO VOTE "
It is often said thai the majority of women
do not want to vote, but who can say or know
the number who ao want to vole? Tens of
thousands have openly expressed their wish in
the aflirmative; still more thousands acknowl
edge that they believe the demand to be just,
and that they cherish in secret a desire to have
a voice in the election of officials to govern
them, but fear to come out openly because
some male relative upon whom they are de
pendent is "bitterly" opposedâ this male rela
tive being often a very decent sort of a man.
It may be said that these women ought to be
braver. Are they, however, less lacking in the
"courage of their convictions" than men who
acknowledge their belief in woman suffrage,
but fear to let it be known on account of sup
posed injury to business or political interests ?
It requires unusual moral courage, as well Â»s
disinterestedness in a woman, to express
opinions favorable to woman's enfranchise
ment, until at least there is a fair prospect of
obtaining it. The comfort of her individual
life and her social consideration usually de
pend upon the good-will of those who hold the
undue power. Women will never express a
"general desire" for suffrage until the men ot
their little worlds have ceased to ridicule and
despise them for it. Senator H. W. Blair of
New Hampshire expresses himself very fully
on this point:
There are many reasons why some women
declare themselves opposed to the extension
of suffrage to their sex. Some well-fed and
pampered, without serious experiences in life,
ore incapable of comprehending the subject at
all. Vast numbers, who secretly and earnestly
desire it, from the long habit of deference to
the wishes of the other sex, upon whom they
are so entirely dependent while disfranchised,
and knowing the hostility of their "protec
tors" to the agitation of the subject conceal
their real sentiments and the "lord" of the
family referring this question to his wife, who
has heard him sneer or worse than sneer at
suffrKists for half a lifetime, ought not to ex
pect an answer which she knows will subject
her to his censure and ridicule or even his un
expressed disapprobation.
George William Curtis, the editor for so
many years of the "Easy Chair" in Harper's
Monthly, touched upon the same point in his
genial, witty way in one of the last issues be
fore his death. He gives a supposititious con
versation between an elderly wit and a comely
young woman in a crowded omnibus the wit
having asked his son, sitting in his lap, why
he did not get up and give the lady his seat.
If the comely maid had suddenly and
sweetly asked the elderly wit whether he was
a true American, and believed that taxation
and representation should go together, he
would nave promptly replied, "Yes.Nna'em."
But if she had then whipped out her logical
rapier and thrust at him the question, "Are
you, then, in favor of giviug me a vote?" his
cleverness and his courtesy would have
blended in his reply, ''Madam, when women
demand it they will have it." It is the uui
versai reply of the ingenious patriot, who is
aware that the argument is against him, but
who is still unconvinced.
Mr. Curtis then makes the comely maid bring
forward in rapid succession the queries: "Has
It been the general custom of Legislatures to
wait until everybody interested in a reform
asked for it before granting it?" "Whether
imprisonment for debt was abolished because
poor debtors as a body requested it, or because
it was deemed best in the general interest that
it should be abolished"; "Whether hanging
for stealing a leg of mutton was renounced be
cause the hapless thieves demanded it, or be
cause Romilly showed that humanity and the
welfare of society and of respect for law re
quired it" ; "Whether the slave trade was
stopped and the West Indian slaves emanci
pated by England because the slaves peti
tioned, or because Parliament thought such
reforms desirable for the interests of Eng
land."
But, even if a large number of women do not
desire any change in the constitution, that
would be a very bad reason for withholding
the elective franchise from those who desire
it. Senator Blair says:
If the right (of suffrage) exist at all it is an
individual right, and not one which belongs to
a class or to the sex as such. Yet men tell us
that they will vote the suffrage to womeu
whenever \he majority of women desire it.
Are, then, our rights the property of the ma
jority of the disfranchised class to which we
may chance to belong? What would be said if
it were seriously proposed to recall the suffrage
from ail colored or from all white men because
a majority of either class should decline or for
any cause fail to note? I know that it is said
that the suffrage is a privilege to be extended
by those who have it to those who have it not.
But the matter of right, of moral right, to the
franchise does not depend upon the indiffer
ence of those who possess it or of those who do
not possess it to the desire of those women
who wish to enjoy their right , and to discbarge
their duty. If one or many choose not to
claim their right, it is no argument for depriv
ing me of mine or one woman of hers.
From all points of view, the argument that
women -Jo not want to vote proves to be no ar
gument at all, because if the right to vote is
gained they can exercise it or not, as they
choose. It is not a compulsory exercise of
power on their part. It is not proposed to
"force suffrage" upon any one, but only to
give every qualified woman the option or not
as she pleases, just as a qualified man has the
option. And which is the more creditable to
womanhood, the attitude of the suffragists
who say, "Let each woman do as she chooses,"
or that of the remonstrants, "Make all women
do as we choose"?
It seems fitting to close with another quota
tion from the "Easy Chair":
"The fabled stream that sank from sight and
emerged far away, still flowing, is an image of
the course of all progress. The argument which
establishes the reason ana the benefit of reform
does not, therefore, at once establish it, still
less complete it There are obstructions, de.
lays, disappearances; but still the stream
flows, seen or unseen, still it swells, and reap
pearing far from where it vanished, moves
brimming to the sea." Elizabeth Sargent.
McKINLEY AS A SPEAKER.
New York Mail and Express.
It is a noteworthy fact that every speech de
livered by William McKinley in this campaign
only serves to more clearly demonstrate the
strength of his candidacy and his complete
mastery of the great issues now agitating the
Nation. It is also evident that the recent
speeches of this champion of protection and
sound money have had the effect of cooling off
the fiery eagerness of Bryan for a joint discus
sion. The Free Silver-Populistic candidate is
beginning to appreciate the fact that his top
loftical style of harangue and extravagant
rhetorical figures would suffer sadly in com
parison with McKinley's logical statement of
tacts in the plain language of the people.
Major McKinley's speech to the delegates ol
the National Convention of Window-glass
Workers wm characteristically strong in argu
ment, perspicuous in style and stirring in
appeal. His audience was a typical boay of
intelligent American workingmen, represent
ing eleven States of the Union, and connected
with one of the great industries of the country
Their spokesman, in addressing the people's
candidate, said, "We want the protective prin
ciple restored. We are satisfied with the
quality of our dollars, and have no fear as to
the volume of our money if the tariff is regu
lated and levied on such principles as best to
protect American industries, and to secure
sufficient funds to meet the ordinary expenses
of government." This simple and siraightior
ward expression of the people's wants and
needs furnished the text tor the Major's cogent
and inspiring response.
The ever-alert and always-ready champion of
the cause of the people outlined the entire
situation and stirred the hearts of his hearers
by a few clear-cut and ringiug words. He
compressed a volume within a single sen
tence by declaring that "the credit of the Gov
ernment, like that of the individual citizen, is
best subserved by living within its means,
and providing means with which to live."
He summarized the Republican programme as
follows: "To put upon the statute books of the
country a law under which the Government
will collect enough money to meet its expendi
tures, stop debts and deficiencies and ade
quately protect American labor. This will re
store confidence and revive business pros
perity."
He declared for an unequivocal maintenance
of sound money and eloquently called on all
"patriotic and conscientious citizens to make
common cause in resisting the propose^ de
basement of our currency, the degradation of
our country's honor, and in upholding the
continued supremacy of law and orderâ tha
strongest pillar of free government."
Such eloquent ana patriotic appeals to the
conscience, honor and self-respect of tha
people cannot fail of their desired effect. Wil.
liam McKinley * peaks from his heart and con
sequently reaches the hearts of his hearers.
He speaks in the language of Llneolu, ami,
like Lincoln, he will prevail with the great
body of the American people, who have never
gone wrong and never will go wrong on any
supreme issue involving the safety and honor
of the Nation.

DIMPLES AND WRINKLES.
The deepest of dimples to wrinkles have run
Since Mary was twenty and I twenty-one;
But dimpled or wrinkled, my sweetheart's thÂ«
From the sunburst of life to its last little flame.
The checks that were roses areshrunken and pale,
But their velvety purity never will fail;
And lips that were flushed with the red blood of
youth
Are warm with a love as undying as truth.
The bine of her eves is fading to gray.
And the gold of her hair Is silver to-aay;
Bui the soul is the same thai was orbed In the
blue,
And silvern is golden when love lights the view.
And, dimpled or wrinkled, a blush will confess
The happiness born of a lover's caressâ
For the heart of a woman is tender as true
Aud the passion it cherishes ever is new.
Wittt Mary at twenty and me twenty-one,

With Mary at sixty and me sixty-one.
Why, dimples were made so that wrinkles might

CHILD'S NIGHT DRAWERS.
For midseason wear, where flannel is dis

this sensible garment. Heavy cotton or drill
are the most sensible of the white goods, but
for little tots of two years lighter muslin is
used. :

a red, smooth surface, which would burn like
fire and itch. On the inside of the upper part of
my limbs, great red blotches would appear, and
as soon as I became warm, the burning and itch-
ing woold begin^ Night after night I would lie
awake and scratch, and almost go wild. I got a

A gusty breeze along the water front

One small craft, however, with a party
of five ventured out on a day's fishing,
and are now blessing their lucky stars
Perilous Predicament of Five Men Clinging to a Capsized Boat on the Bay Yesterday. One Was
Caught in a Fishnet and Almost Drowned. They Were Rescued by the Ukiah.
[Sketched by a "CaU " artist]
that* sent the big ferry-boat Ukiah their
way in the nick of time. They were Wil
liam Miller, H. Bie Jen berg, Fred Jensen,
George Bayless and Pasquale Anebili to
manage the boat.
It was a merry sail till they arrived off Al
catraz Island, when a sudden squail struck
their exceedingly cranky craft, whirling
it over bottom up in the bay. Then began
thefigutfor life between the waves and
the five helpless men. Being all thrown
one way when the boat capsized, they
clutched that side and turned her com
pletely over again.
The boat was buoyant and light and the
struggles of the men simply rolled her
over like an empty cracker-box. George
Bayless, a printer, well known in this
City, was not only incumbered with a
heavy overcoat but became caught in thp
boat and was unable to free himself.
When the boat was bottom up he was
wholly under water, but the struggles of
his companions would lift him into the
air and be would get a few breaths before
he was whirled under again.
Finally he kicked himself free from the
boat and found he was caught in the
fish-net like "a big salmon." He said he
floundered around and though unable to
get out of the snare he had intended for
a large string of fish he secured a eood
grip on the stem of the boat where he
field until rescued. When lifted from the
water he was badly mixed up with the net
and other fishing gear, and this kept him
from going to the bottom of the bay.
In the meantime the other four were
struggling, each man for himself. Pas
quale had experience enough to keep
away from the others, and. kicking off his
shoes and most of his clothing, made good
weather of it. But Jensen, Bielenberg and
Miller were fast exhausting themselves in
their efforts to get a safe grip on the boat.
Miller was dragged under the water by
his companions, and he says he swallowed
most all the bay before he was rescued.
But the life-savers were at hand. Cap
tain Van Pelt of the steamer Ukiah had
seen the men in the water and was hurry
ing his boat with all the power of her big
paddle wheels to their rescue.
When the steamer reached the scene a
boat was lowered in quick time and was
soon among the drowning fishing party.
They were so far gone that in a moment
more a Sunday tragedy would have been
enacted there. Bayless was pulled into
the Ukiah's boat with hid net still around
him and Miller was unconscious. Aboard
of the steamer they were taken car? of and
were returned to the City wet and hatless,
but thankful for their rescue.
When the boat capsized Jensen's watch
stopped, with the hands on the dial mark
ing 2:20, and they were picked up just
twenty minutes after.
Another boating incident occurred yes
terday in which two fair young summer
girls and the crew of their imperiled craft
were rescued from the choppy seas off the
stormy coast of El Campo.
The ladies had grown aweary of the
dance, the swings aud the merry-go-round,
and having reached the high-water mark
on icecream, lemonade and soda frappe,
they demanded of their gallant es
cort an excursion on the blue waters of
t&e bay, and he assented, being proud to
admit of bis nautical ignorance. A boat
was procured and the party started out,
assisted much in getting off by a sweeping
tide.
Soon they were in a mad torrent of
waves and their boatman was as rattled as
ever landlubber could well eet to be. They
set up a cry tnat echoed and echoed along
the Marin shore. But a rescuer was near
in a gallant sloop manned by Commodore
Atkinson as skipper and Bert Bygrave as
crew. The commodore jibed his boat
alongside of the other craft, and as the
main boom suddenly swung round it
knocked the crew overboard. But the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 1896.
sailor man was equal to the occasion. He
floundered into the boat with the fright
ened ladies and swore by Neptune tbat he
was there to save them if tne water took
the crease out of his trousers.
"Oh, you dear, darling, brave man,"
they cried, and they hugged him and
twisted around in the boat till she shipped
a sea that almost swamped her. The res
cuer blushed to a new brick red and trem
bled with fear and cold till his teeth chat
tered.
The party was safely conveyed ashore
vowing that thÂ°y would never, never
again go to sea.
Yesterday v squad of young men be
longing to* the Naval Battalion congre
gated at their boathouse on the Folsom
street wharf and made general nuisances
of themselves.
They visited the neighboring beershops
with the regularity of old salts after a
long cruise at sea, and then turned them
selves loose. One of the number purchased
some fruit from a peddler and then the
crowd of blue jackets began a rowdy play.
They threw soft peaches at each other till
their uniforms were (sputtered with the
fruit. A number of ladies standing at tbe
boat-landing had their dresses stained
and ruined by the flying missiles. It
would be a good idea for tne commander
of the battalion to detail an officer to take
care of those young fellows when on duty
and ashoie, if they cannot do it them
selves.
Customs Inspector John A. Ross got on
a spree and ran amuck yesterday on the
water front. He boarded a Market-street
car and immediately proceeded to tell the
gripman bis opinion of that person in
language most vile. Several ladies left the
car, and when the railroad employes tried
to induce him to do the same he fought
like a wild beast. Special Officer Glocker
finally dislodged him after a severe con
test. At the Harbor Police Station he
violently assaulted Keeper Charles Cul
lum and had to be subdued by main
strength. He was locked up, charged with
using vulgar languaee, drunkenness and
disturbing the peace. There will proba
bly be a vacancy in the customs service.
A Day's Outing.
The second annual picnic of the Defender
Social Club is to take place at San Rafael Park,
San Rafael, to-day. The members of the
club will meet at their hall on Kearny street
at 8 oc'loclt and march to the wharf at the foot
of Clay street, from which the boat will start
at 9 o'clock. It is to be a private affair, and
none but the Defenders will be admitted to
the grounds.
PULLED HIS REVOLVER.
Frank Kenigoani, a Cook, Threatens to
Shoot a Conductor for De
manding His Fare.
Frank Kenigoani, a cook, scared the
passengers on a Geary-street car yesterday
afternoon, and is now locked up in the
City Prison.
The car was on its way to the City, and
Kenigoani boarded it at Devisadero street,
taking his seat on the dummy. The con
ductor asked him for his fare and he paid
no attention to him. Then the conductor
placed his hand on his shoulder and again
demanded his fare. Kiengoani pulled a re
volver out of his pocket, and, pointing it
at the conductor, said: "Don't you touch
me or I'll shoot you. I won't pay my
fare."
Policeman Clancy happened to be stand
ing at Scott street, and the car was
stopped and he was notified of the cook's
actions. He placed him under arrest, and
at the City Prison he was charged with
threats to kill and carrying a concealed
weapon.
He had only a nickel in his pockets
when searched at the City Prison, and he
said he was keeping it for a steam beer
There is a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon also pending against Kenigoani.
PIRATES SHOT THE COOK.
Found Aboard the Schooner Norm* by
George Lindermau.
When George Linderman, the cook of
the schooner Norma, which is lying at the
foot of Fourth street, went aboard at 7
o'clock last evening, after an afternoon
ashore, he found the schooner m tempo
rary possession of water front pirates.
They were in the cabin helping themselves
to clothing and other valuables belonging
to the captain and mate when Lindeman
appeared. He tried to corner them until
he could get police assistance, but they
took a shot at Linderman, the bullet strik
ing him in ono of his arms, inflicting a
severe flesh wound.
The men, three or four in number
jumped over the side of the schooner and
made off in a Whitehall boat. They got
away with one suit of clothes.
Cook Linderman was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital.
Later the boat was found near the
schooner with the revolver lying on the
bottom of it. The boat had evidently been
abandoned by the thieves.

"Yes," aaid Commissioner Rosenfeld,
"there is the new bridge across the main
drive which the people demand, that will
costagood sum of money."
"And what is more to be deplored," ad
ded the superintendent, "is the fact that
trees set out in about two hundred acres
of ground west of Strawberry Hill will die
for want of efficient nutriment.
"What is most needed is money with
which to procure loam. I believe that it

is best that the trees which require many
years to grow should be taken care of
first. Flowers and grass-plats may be neg
lected fora time, as it does not take long
to restore them, but if trees are allowed to
die, and many of them in the district
west of Strawberry Hill are now six feet
or more high, it means from ten to twelve
years to restore them. There is danger of
that portion of the park becoming de
nuded and that section becoming a wil
derness ajrain. The sand there does not
nourish the roots."
A gentleman who was present during
the conversation suggested that the bridge
construction might be delayed for a year,
until the next appropriation is made.
Mr. Rosenfeld, while of the opinion that
that structure ought to be commenced
without delay, intimated that it might be
come necessary to delay the work, and
added: "There are some who do not ap
preciate the value of the park to the peo
ple who come here for recreation. They
do things differently in the East. The
Merchants' Association, composed of gen
tlemen who understand the needs of the
City as well as any set of men can, sug
gested that liberal appropriation be made
for the park, but what they said did not
amount to anything."
What will be done will be discussed at
the next meeting of the Commissioners
and plans of operation will probably at
that time be decided upon.
The work of putting in the partitions in
the annex to the museum has been com
pleted, and a very small force of men are
tinting the walls of the several depart
ments in the shades that will best suit the
several displays to be exhibited in them.
When the cases in which the exhibits are
to be deposited are finished the place will
be ready to be thrown open to the public.
For want of room in tne present building
the many contributions that have recently
been made to the museum have been
placed in a storeroom, and they will not.
be put on exhibition until the annex is
completed.

and the zephyrs from the west enlarge the
tears day by day. Yesterday one of these
had extended to such a size that the visit
ors had an opportunity to obtain a profile
view of the face.
There were many visitors to the lake
around Strawberry Hill yesterday and
many of the ladies without escorts went
out in boats for a row. This exercise seems
to be appreciated by them judging from
the great number who work at the oars.
Next Saturday morning the members of
the San Francisco Fly Casting Club will
go to the lake to try tneir luck at long dis
tance casting.
Last Saturday Louis J. Ohnimus, who
has charge of the boats on the lake, killed
a fox which for some time past had been
playing sad havoc with the ducks that
add to the attractiveness of the eastern
end of the lake. The skin of the depreda
tor is being stuffed and it will be placed
with theotber curios in the museum.
The site of the old Forty-nine Mining
Camp of the Midwinter Fair has been
turned into an arboretum, and, this hav

ors that most exquisite flower, El Spirito
Santo (the Holy Ghost flower), which is

beautiful Camellia Begonias in every
shade â flowers that surpass any of the
begonias heretofore shown â and be takes
an unusual pride in them from the fact
that they are a California production, hav
ing been propagated after many years of
experimenting by J. H. Sievers of this
City. Their equal cannot be found in the
finest collections in the world.
There was a good attendance at the
Cliff and beach, but there was no perform
ance in the baths, nothing but ordinary,
everyday swimming and musical selec
tions by the band. The cause of this was
the retirement of Colonel T. i > . Robinson
irom the position of amusement manager
of tbe baths.
There was a large attendance at the
HaigLt-street erounds, the chief attrac
tions being the boy Sandow, who gave ex
hibitions of extraordinary strength, the
Intelligent orang-outang and the balloon
ascension. Miss Lelia Adair, the elder of
the Viola sisters, was to have made the
ascent, which was to be followed by a
parachute drop, but when let go the bal
loon gave a lurch and caused Miss Adair
to lose her hold on the trapeze- bar.
In endeavoring to recover it, some one
of tbe crowd ran against the aeronaut and
almost threw her to the ground. Just
then the balloon gave another lurch and
this brought one end of the trapeze-bar
with tfrent force against Miss Adair's right
shoulder-blade, which was once fractured
during an ascension, and the blow caused
her such pain that she did not have
strength enough to grasp the bar, so the
balloon went up without her snd rose
higher and went further than any balloon
that ever left the grounds. Her younger
sister, who was injured the Sunday previ
ous, is still confined to her bed by reason
of the injury which she received when she
fell on the roof of a house.
DEDICATED TO GOD'S USE,
The New Howard Presbyterian
Church Open to the
Public.
The First Church Was on Natoma
Street, but Later Removed to
Mission Near Third.
The new Howard Presbyterian Church
on Oak street, corner of Baker, was for
mally and appropriately dedicated yester
day afternoon. "With song and prayer the
beautiful building, a gem of the architect's
genius, was consecrated to the worship of
God.
The floral decorations were simple, yet
exquisitely and tastefully arranged. Hy
drangeas of the pink, blue and white va
riety, with a background of fern, made the
altar, temporarily, at least, a place of
sweet scents which seemed to blend pleas
ingly with the eloquent and inspired
words of the several speakers.
The interior of the new church is a di
rect contradiction of most modern edifices.
Instead of being deep it is broad, tending
to create the effect of a family gathering.
At both ends there are two galleries, in
tended ordinarily for classrooms, but
which can be connected with the audito
rium should the occasion arise. Just back
of the rostrum stands the bia: orsan,
around which there is sumcient room to
Beat a choral choir of forty.
Long before the hour announced|for the
opening of the dedicatory services the 600
seats were filled. The galleries were
thrown open, and they, too, were soon
crowded to overflowing. The exercises
commenced with an organ prelude by
William F. Hooke, organist and musical
director. This was followed by the doxol-

Henley.
Rev. Mr. Doane of Mizpah church read
a lesson taken from Kings, following
which came the dedicatory sermon by
Dr. H. C. Alinton. The speaker referred
in eloquent terms to the new house of God,
urging all members to work for it faith
fully and earnestly as the one way to ad
vance the cause of Christ. The pastor,
Key. F. R. Farrand, then read the usual
dedication exercises, after which Dr.
George B. Somers, chairman of the build
ing committee, formally transferred the
keys of the building to the legally consti
tuted custodians of the property, repre
sented in this instance by Captain Charles
Nelson, chairman of the Board of Trus
tees.
The exercises concluded with a short
prayer by Rev. Mr. Stewart and a few re
marks by visiting Presbyterians and min
isters. The visiting clergymen were Rev.
8. H. Willey, Rev. F. A. Doane, Rev.
George Stewart and Dr. H. C. Minton.
David N. Hawley, one of the four organ
izers of the original church, was also in
attendance.
The Howard Presbyterian Church was
organized in ISSO, the first church being on
the corner of Natoma and New Montgom
ery streets.
Rev. S. H. Willey was pastor from 1850
to 1862. The lumber for the building was
brought from Maine, and the ground was
presented by the late William D. N. How
ard. About forty years ago the church
sold the Natoma-street property, moving
on Mission street, near Third. Some
months since the trustees received an offer
for that property, and after due consulta
tion with the members of tbe congregation
it was deemed advisable to accept it. The
present property was then purchased, and
the result is seen in the formal dedication
of the new building as told above.
The new Sunday-school was organized
yesterday morning with 147 pupiis. J. P.
Prutzman was elected superintendent and
Purcell Howe assistant. Tiio Christian
Endeavor Society will in future meet every
Sunday evening at 6:30 o'clock.
BUTTONS ARE THE CRAZE.
A New Fad Started in Connec
tion With the Political
Campaign.
Being Used for Advertising by Manu
facturers of all Kinds of
Merchandise.
Pleasure-seekers at the Park yesterday
were kept busy trying to read the inscrip
tions on the miscellaneous assortment of
buttons that decorated the lapels of thou
sands of bicyclists and pedestrians. But
tons of every description, bearing mottoes
of every kind, were greatly in evidence,
and the easy-going citizen who was not
quite up to date marveled at the sud
den appearance of this very latest fm-de
siecle adornment.
The "button craze" ha? already struck
the town, and threatens to throw all other
fads into the shade during tbe next few
months. One firm has already sent out
the advance guard in the shape of great
cards ot miscellaneous buttons to be given
away withl its cigarettes. Pictures of Mc-
Kiuley on backgrounds of flags and
shields and whole firmaments of stars are
among the most common patterns.
"McKinley, Sis-Boom-Ah! Hobart" is
also a favorite among those who are work
ing for the man from Canton.
Eastern manufacturers are turning out
"crowns of thorns" and "crosses of gold"
by the thousand.
Tattered urchins and messenger boys all
over the City already have their jackets
decorated profusely with such Democratic
slogans as, "I'll carry silver if it breaks
my back," "Silver is good enough for me,"
"Wall street demonetized silver," "The
bants don't want free silver, I do; I don't
own a bank," and "The goldbug is a hum
bug."
Even Non-partisans have been provided
for. Non-committal button-wearers are
offered such inscriptions as, "Hush, you'll
wake the baby," "Yes, darling," "Don't

A Lively Team Match at

J. C. WALLER'S MEN WIN
Strecker Again Carries Off the
Californias' Champion
Honors.
BREMER'S PRIZE IS IN SIGHT.
An Interesting Private Match Among
Three Military Marksmen.
Other Events.
It was a lively day at the Schuetzen
Part rifle range near San Rafael yester
day, and Captain Schuman had his hands
full providing for his guests. Nearly a
dozen targets were up and the only rest
the markers had was during the half
hour's intermission at noon. With two
exceptions, the marksmen were all mem
bers of the German shootine clubs.
The large attendance of those of the
California Schuetzen Club was ac
counted for by the two attractions, the
monthly medal contest and the team shoot
for a dinner. Adolph Strecker arrived
late, but he held his own and went to the
front again as the first in the champion
class.
He carried off this honor in spite of the
fact that he shot irregularly shaped bul
lets, caused by his bullet-mold having
outlived its usefulness, a fact that he did
not discover in time to secure better am
munition. Charles Thierbach made a
pretty run in his score for second prize in
the second champion class. Louis Ben
do], after a hard struggle, took the first
prize honors in the first class, closely fol
lowed by J. P. Robinson. Otto Bremer
stands a Rood chance of finally winning
the href prize in the second clasÃ. In fact
it is almost conceded that he will be
adorned with this medal.
The scores made were as follows, Ger
man ring target, twenty shots, 200 yards:
First championâ First prize, A. Strecker 439
rings; secomi prize, J. Utschig Sr. 418.
Second championâ First prize, CharlesThier
bach4l2; fcecond prize, O. Burmeister 353.
First classâ Firs 1 , prize. L. Bendel 4ll; second

Second classâ First prize, O. Bremer 419;
second prize, L. Reubold 388.
Third classâ Firat prize, A. Breuss 408; sec
ond prize, J. C. Waller 373.
Fourth classâ Kir<t prize, A. N. Boyan 387;
second prize, A. Hampel 365.
Schuetzen Cadetsâ First class, A. Reubold
294; second class, J. Kullmann 355.
Best first shot, A. Jungbiut 25; best last shot,
O. Bremer 25.
The great event of the day, however,
was the team match between two selected
teams of tbe Californias. In each team
tbere were eighteen of the best shots in
the club, and on the result depended a
dinner for the three dozen. J. C. Waller
was the captain of one squad, and T. J.
Carroll, the everywhere-:; -the-same-time
shooting-master of the club, was in charge
of the other. The selection of men was
impartial, but Captain Waller's men
pulled out 62 points ahead. The condi
tions were ten shots to each man, the
club to pay for the dinners for the winners
and the losers to pay for themselves.
Captain Schuman provided a splendid re
past for the marksmen, but he declared
that the losing team ate so much that he
lost all of the profits on the dinner. The
scores were as follows:

resulted in the following class winners
and their scores of twenty shots in the
German ring target:
Champion classâ Fred Baumgartner, 412
rings.
First class- D. Diethelm, 393.
SÂ«cond classâ Joseph Fetz, 382.
Third classâ R. Hauser. 347.
Best first shot, Al Geh-et, 24; best last shot,
Fred Baumgartner, 24.
The west end of the ranee was kept
noisy all day with the rattle of musketry,
as two militia companies were holding
their montnlv"medal shoot there. An in
teresting private match for the dinner was
held among thrCe of Company D's men.
Some fine shooting was done on the mili
tary target, as seen by these scores:
J. Jones 4 45455456 5â46
T. Kerrigan. 4 54646564 0â 46

H. L. FABRY'S DEATH.
Said to Be No Mysteryâ Dr. Buchanan's
Efforts to Save Hit
Patient.
The assumed mystery attending the
death last Friday evening of Herman L.
Fabry, who was suffocated by gas, is said
to be, upon further investigation, no mys
tery at all. There is no evidence to sus
tain the suicide theory, and in all proba
bility tbe death was accidental.
When the mother of the decedent de
tected the escaping gas she at once sum
moned Dr. R. A. Buchanan of 523 Laguna
street. He remained with his patient for
twelve hours and did everything medical
science could nuggest to save him, but it
wai too late, and at 7 o'clock in the even
ing he died. It is the opinion of his father,
Leopold M. Fabry, that he got up early in
the morning, tried to light the eras, and
then fell back upon the bed and went to
sleep, leaving the key open.

CORBETT MAY FIGHT.
His Exhibition at Cripple Creek Will
Not Invalidate Hia Agreement
With Sharkey.
James J. Gorbett left San Francisco on
Saturday night for Colorado, where he
will give a boxing exhibition at Cripple
Creek with Billy Woods.
It was considered by some of those who
take a deep interest in the manly art that
his proposed exhibition with Woods
would be an infraction of the agreement
signed by him and Sharkey.
Inquiry, however, dispels this theory.
It is claimed that it is not a match within
tbe meaning of the prize-ring code, inas
much as it is only an exhibition of science
and not for honor or lucre, but just such a
display as, to use tue language of one of
the sports, "you might give in your par
lors before the members of your family."
Tbe same latitude is extended to Shar
key should he see fit to give a "parlor"
exhibition with another of tbe strong
muscled fraternity.
WORLD'S RECORD BEATEN
E. W. Decker of the Acme Club
Rode Five Miles in
10:23.
Rut the Record Cannct Stand, as There
Were Not Enough Timers
Present.
E. W. Decker of the Acme Clnb Wheel
men of Oakland rode five miles on the San
Leandro-Haywards road yesterday after
noon in 10 mm. 23 sec, being nearly a
minute faster than the world's record for
the distance, but because he did not have
the full complement of timers required by
the California Associated Cycling Clubs
the record is unofficial and cannot stand.
The world's five-mile road record is
11:11 2-5, made not long ago by George M.
Hamlin of the San Francisco Road Club
over the same course. Decker has felt all
along that he could better that perform
ance and decided to make t c attempt
yesterday. He had four tandem teams for
pacinir. tbe riders being Brouillet and
Bedbury, Kenna and Agrnew, Dixon and
Menne and Elford and Krafts.
Tbe pace maintained the entire distance
was steady and very last, and Decker kept
up with the tandems well. When tne
watches were compared it was found he
had ridden it in 10:23, but there were only
three timers, and the association and the
Century Road Club of America, by whom
such records are allowed, require fi7e
timers. Decker was disappointed because
he did not get the record, but will try
again next Wednesday afternoon at 4
o'clock.
His ride yesterday was timed by T. L.
Hall at the start and A. P. Swain and C.
B. Shear at the finish. The ride was a re
markable one, and probably the strong
wind at his back helped him a great deal.
He will doubtless get the record next
Wednesday.
Before the record trial the Acme and
Reliance clubs each held a live-mile road
race over the course. The finish of the
Acme race was rather straggling, but the
time made was fairly sood, as will be seen
by the following table:

Yesterday most of the local cycling
clubs had runs to the Park, the San Fran
cisco, Olympic, Alpha, California, Im
perial, bay City, Golden Gate and Ala
mecia Clubs all heading that way.
There was a strong' wind all day and
riding against it was rather hard work
Coming in, however, some of the men
spread out their coats for sails and it was
easy going then.
Toe Camera Club cyclists went to San
Jose yesterday, the Outing Road Club to
Haywards and the Liberty Cycling Club
to Laundry Farm.
Next Sunday all the local and Alameda
County clubs will be in Stockton attend
ing the bis watermelon run of the Ter

by boat Saturday night.
Those Japanese Steamship Linen.
E. S. Babcock of Coronado. president of
many big corporations in San Diego and
Coronado and manager and half owner of the
Hotel del Coronado, returned to the Palace on
his way home from the Yellowstone Park,
where he has been on a pleasure trip. He
thinks that it rests with the Atchison,
T .peka and Santa Fe Railroad rather than
with the citizens of San Diego to secure one of
the Japanese steamship lines. For, he Bays,
it is continental trade and overland rates that
the steamship company wants, for local and
coast commerce is not large enough. San
Diego can offer practically nominal port rates
and can give water frontage for wharves, but
it cannot promise trade that it does not con
trol. Mr. Babcock thinks that the Soutnem
Pacific Company will make a strong effort to
have one of the Japanese lines decide upon
San Francisco as a terminus, and he bases his
opinion on the theory thr.t the railroad prefers
t.) control the land traflic to the exclusion of
the Northern Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka
aud Santa Fe rather than to foster the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company and lose a greater
volume of business.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 1896.
REBEL CORKS ON
PLEASURE BENT,
An Immense Crowd at
Their Picnic at Shell
Mound Park.
SOME FINE GATE FRIZES
The Races and Games Were
Exciting and Very Closely
Contested.
JIG AND REEL DANCING.
Pretty Girls Who Can Dance the
Old as Well as the New Steps.
The Prize Winners
A big crowd attended the tenth annual
picnic of the Rebel Cork Benevolent As
sociation yesterday at Shell Mound ParK,
Berkeley. Extra trains were run all
day long, and the number of people was
one of the largest ever inside the pictur
esque park. The crowd was well-behaved
and orderly, which added much to the
enjoyment of the day.
The Hibernian Band furnished the
rnu-ic tor the occasion. It was kept busy
in the pavilion, where the crowd of dancers
whirled and glided.
One of the most attractive features of the
day's pleasures was the jig and reel danc
ing in a pago-ia under the trees. Professor
McCarthy, a piper, and Professor McMa
hon, violinist, furnished the music for it.
It was something comparatively novel in
the way of dancing, and people stood on
the tables and benches and chairs and
craned their necks in order to see it. This
style of dancing was open to all. Many a
pretty Irish girl showed to an admiring
and applauding multitude that she could
dance a graceful jig as well as a graceful
waltz.
Chauncey Olcott, the Irish comedian,
made a little speech to the crowd In the
pavilion, and by urgent request delivered
a very pleasing recitation.
The chief interest of the day centered in
the great variety of races held in the after
noon. They began at 2 o'clock. The fat
ladies' race brought out a number of very
large entries, and in the fat men's race nb
one was eligible for entry who weighed
less than 250 pounds.
Tbe several grand stands around the
racetrack and arena were rilled with peo
ple, increasing the picturesqueness of the
scene. The individual entries for each
race had friends in the crowd, and by
shouts as be passed them they encouraged
him to greater efforts. It was the same
with the ladies. The races resulted as fol
lows:
For boys under 10 years of age^ â J. Riordan,
first; J. Robertson, second.

fine, ranging from a sewing-machine and
a year's subscription to the Weekly Call
down to %i 50 cash. All the tickets were
placed in a sack, and in the pavilion Kittie
Cookery, 4 years old, put her hand in the
sack and the first fifty-two numbers she
took out won the prizes. Miss Kittie Ches
ter won the sewing-machine.

SOME VIEWS OF THE REBEL CORKS ENJOYING THEMSELVES
COIN FOR THE CRUSADE.
liocal Aid Given to a Great Theosophi-
cal Movement.
The Theosopbical Society that has occu
pied Red Men's Hall regularly every Sun
day evening for the past four years held
its first meeting last night in its new com
modious quarters at Golden Gate Hall, on
Sutter street.
There were several addresses made dur
ing the evening by prominent theoso
phists. Their remarks all bore on the ob
jects and the vast importance of the great
theosophical crusade now being carried
on for the high purpose of chancing the
ideals of humanity and showing them the
path to greater happiness and influences.
The active interest taken by the local
society was amply indicated by tbe speak
ers. A collection to aid the crusaders in
their travels was taken and was responded
to liberally.
The hall, chosen on account of its large
accommodation, was hardly big enough to
hold the large number that attended last
night.
E. B. Rambo presided over the meeting,
and in a few preliminary remarKs wel
comed the society to the new hall and
briefly outlined the history of theosophy
in this country. He said that in 1875 in
New York the first movement toward a
theosophical society was made by a few
persons. This movement has grown
slowly and steadily, until now it stretches
across the extent of the earth.
Meetings that at first were held with a
certain exclusiveness became more public
in nature, and now it is the custom to
open the doings of the society to the whole
world. The society is now in its twenty
first year, and another method of propa
ganda has been put into effect in the form
of a crusede of seven people, who will
visit every land and show what t eosophy
really is, what it leaches and what it will
accomplish.
After an instrumental solo by Miss
Alice Winant, Dr. Anderson spoke on the
purpose of the crusade. He said in part:
The purpose of the crusade briefly expressed
is to change the ideals of humanity. Theosophy
presents Itself as a vehicle to do this. No man
can help himself or his fellow-men without
realizing how puerile, how low and how con
temptible, are the present ideals of the human
race.
This address was followed by E. P.
Jones, who spoke on the messages of the
osophy.
"Theosophy," said he, "teaches that
there is a proper way to live and a proper
way to die. or, in other words, a proper
way of life."
Mrs. M. M. Thirds then spoke with
much beauty of thought and expression
on "Brotherhood." She said that the
souls of men were but sparks of the great
central fire, the deity.
MONEY TO SAVE
PUBLIC HEALTH.
An Increased Appropria
tion Vigorously
Sought.
CALAMITIES PREDICTED.
Special Session of the Board
of Health Last
Night.
PRESS SUPPORT IS INVOKED.
The Sum Required for Food Inspec
tion, Ambulance Sys*
tern, Etc.
A special meeting of the Board of
Health was held last evening at the office
of Dr. G. J. Fitzgibbon, a member of the
board. The special session was called to
consider the allowance made by the Board
of Supervisors to maintain the Health De
partment for the fiscal year ending June
30,1897. The physicians comprising the
board hold that tbe sum appropriated is
wholly inadequate, and they therefore de
sire that the Supervisors should raise the
estimates and increase the allowance in
this particular respect.
In a statement for the public press for
mulated at the meeting last night it is set
forth that tbe persistent and successful
efforts of the press to reduce the tax rates
have resulted in taking from the Depart
ment of Public Health appropriations
which are vital to the City's welfare. The
powerful influence of the press is, there
fore, earnestly requested tc prevent a gross
injustice to the Health Department and a
serious calamity to the City.
The point is advanced that the tax rate
this year will be low â $105 on the hun
dred dollars â and that the total amount of
mun icipal expenses will be over $5,000,000.
It is cited that the Health Department is
allowed but $25,000, but that $25,000 more
earnestly asked for would only raise the
tax rate to $1 05>Â£. In other words, the
Board of Health asks that at least 1 per
cent of the City's expenses should be de
voted to preserving the health of its
340,00 C inhabitants.
Reference is made in tbe statement to a
meeting held at the Chamber of Com-
merce, and the written petition, signed by
a ereat number of taxpayers, nearly all
the banking institutions and building as
sociation and a great number of mer
chants, recommending the Supervisors to
allow an increased appropriation. The
statement was that the petition was signed
by over half of the taxable wealth of the
Ciiy.
To prove that a question of patronage
is not involved the members of the Board
of Health will gladly turn over tbe entire
patronage which will be created to any
competent person or board, and aid every
effort to make its distribution non-parti
san and tbe appointments subject to a
civil service examination. The board
says: "We have found the patronage an
annoyance which rises to the dignity of a
curse."
Some interesting comparisons are made
in the manifesto of the Board of Health.
It is, said that the appropriation allowed
to insuie the health of 340,000 citizens is
less than what is paid annually to the
janitors who sweep out the City Hall.
It is only one-seventh of the $175,000
which is spent each year to maintain 1300
inmates of the City and County Hos
pital, Almshou?e and Pesthouse.
It is contended that this inadequate ap
propriation forces San Francisco to be the
only city cf its size in the civilized world
which is without an ambulance system.
In summing up all the calamities of the
insufficient allowance the Board of Health
says:
"In a word, this beggarly appropriation
means disease, disgrace and wholesale
murder. These are not empty terms. The
record shows them to be a conservative
statement of facts."
In closing, the address takes the ground
that the newspapers can avert the in
iquity by demanding $25,000 merely for the
Health Department. The additional
wants as expressed in the address are:
Eight good inspectors, $7200 a year, a
laboratory, $1800; chemist and assistants,
$2700; bakery Inspector, $900; patrolman
for canned coods, $900; three ambulances,
$3600; maintenance and equipment, $5000;
veterinary surgeon, $1800; bath and laun
dry inspector, $900; sewer inspector, $900;
insane, $500; Receiving Hospital, operat
ing tabln and instruments, $1500; clerk of
vital statistics, $900; additional office ex
penses, $2700.
The closing paragraph reads:
- We have secured the assistance of the peo
ple. We ask the aid of the press in this mat
ter, so vital to the welfare of the Cityâ the
' public health of Sau Franciscoâ and we beg to
assure you in advance of our grateful thanks
for such aid, which will vastly lighten the la
bors we shall otherwise have to make to ac
quaint the citizens with tha conditions we
have outlined above, for we are dreadfully in
earnest, and we will surely and indelibly fix
the responsibility for the misfortunes of this
City in the matter of the health and physical
comforts of all its citizens, rich and toor
alike.

Hart, John M. Williamsonâ Board of Health of

AN ILLUSTRATED SERMON.
Key. Frank K. Baker of Epworth Met h-
odUt Church Vaea Oil Paintings.
Rev. Frank K. Baker, pastor of the Ep
worth Methodist Charch, corner of Twen
ty-sixth and Church streets, has intro
duced a novel feature into his Sunday
evening sermons, by exhibiting large oil
paintings of scripture scenes in connec
tion with his preaching.
The first of the series of illustrated ser
mons which Rev. Mr. Baker will preach
was delivered last night before a large con
gregation. The subject of last night's ad
dress was "Heart Hardening," and each
of the three causes of heart hardeningâ
the sins of contention, procrastination
and presumption, were illustrated by
large oil paintings, revolving upon a reel.
Contention was represented by a picture
of the spies holding up before the Israel
ites the grapes of Eschol. The death of
the spies who had caused the children of
Israel to murmur, represented the second
sin. Procrastination, the sin of presump
tion, was typified in the children of Israel
going up into Canaan against God's will.
On next Sunday evening a sermon, illus
trated by three large oil paintings, will be
delivered on the "Life of Christ."
WILL BE MORE COURSING.
First Meet at Ocean View Grounds Un
der tho New Management.
The Ocean View Coursing Park wil! re
open next Sunday under the new manage
ment, which consists of D. Dillon, P. J.
Riley, J. Cox and M. Tiernan, all old-time
coursing men and well-known throughout
the State.
A large meet is expected and probably
over sixty dogs will be entered. The en
trance will be ?1 50 for each doe, and $25
will be added to the stake. The drawing
will take place on Friday nicht at Delta
Hall. Besides a large number of dogs
from this City there will also be hounds
from San Jose and Port Costa entered in
the meet.
MEDALS FOR HANDBALL
Games in the Tournament Now
Going On and More to
Follow.
Several Exciting and Close Finishes
in the Three Courts Yes*
terday.
Handball is on the boom and many
player? who were comparatively unknown
a few months ago are coming rapidly to
the front. The tournament at the Occi
dental court is responsible in a large
measure for bringing this fact into notice,
and it is doing a good work for the manly
sport.
At the San Francisco court yesterday M.
McNeil and Phil Ryan, the proprietor,
had another tussle for supremacy. Each
chose a new partner, Ryan bavins R. Shea
and McNeil M. Manning. Three games
were played and they were possibly the
most exciting seen in the court, the final
being won by McNeil and Manning by one
ace. McNeil eschewed French dinners,
which put him in better condition than
on the previous Sunday, but Ryan was
foolish enough not to do any training for
the event, imagining that the Nicasio air
would have a permanent effect.
Another clever game was played, the
participants being J. Riordan and G. Dahl
against P. T. Donnelly and D. Connelly.
The former team won in three straight
games, but tliey were close and exciting.
Phil Ryan, in order to encourage the
sport among juveniles, has offered a gold
medal and a silver medal to be competed
for in his court. The medals have the ini
tials of the court on a cross-bar. Eight
boys have already entered for the compe
tition, which will commence in two weeks.
They are: J. Collins, R. Murphy, T. Fay,
W. Stansbury, M. Edwards, G. McGuire,
J. White and T. Ryan.
At the Union court an exciting game
was played between Terry McManus, one
of the proprietors, and J. Wren. Each
won a rub after some brilliant play, and
the final will be played next Sunday. The
event of the day was a game between J. J.
Feeney and R. Lenihan and J. Hariow,
ex-coast champion, and M. J. Kilgailon.
It was a rattling game, and was won after
a close finish by Feeney and Lenihan.
Following were the games played in the
courts:

The Labor Exchange Hopes

GIVE VALUE FOR VALUE
The Worth of a Man's Daily
Toil Is Recorded on
Paper.
TO BUILD HEADQUARTEES HERE
There Are Now One Hundred and
Sixty Flourishing Branches in
the Country.
The Labor Exchange, an organization
intended to lighten the burdens of the la
boring man by depriving the over rich of
excessive profits, is rapidly gathering a
large membership. More than 400 people
in San Francisco have joined, among them
being laboring men, artisans, merchants
and professional men. The organization
is contemplating the building of head
quarters here in the near mture.
One remarkable feature of the organiza
tion is the fact that it claims that it is
doing effective work quietly. It says
little, but continually saws wood.
The Labor Exchange was organized
about four years ago in Missouri by G. B.
de Bernardi. When a boy he felt that
something was wrong with society and set
about to remedy the condition, finally
evolving the prese nt system embodied in
the Labor Exchange. From the nucleus
started near the Mississippi a powerful and
wide-extended society h as grown.
The San Francisco branch is now two
years old. This ia one of the twenty
branches in California and of the 160 ia
the United States.
The main object is to pat the unem
ployed to work, and also to do away with
the present monetary system.
In each city there i? a building called a
depository, where a member brings the
fruit ot his labor â a load of farm produce,
a suit of clothes or a pair of shoes, elc.
For this he receives a check, correspond
ing somewhat to the greenback used in
United States currency. These checks are
marked with the same relative value as
coin, that is, in dollars and cents. With
this check he may buy whatever he pleases,
or store it away for future use. This check
bears the receiver's name and would be
tender only by him. When the checks
have been used they are canceled.
"Our checks," said R. Patek, chairman
of the building committee yesterday, "are
really worth more than legal tender, as
each dollar represents so much work be
hind it.
"The depository buys at wholesale and
sells at retail and the margins of the
transactions runs the establishment.
"We have learned the reason," be con
tinued, "from the capitalists and monopo
lists. We simply keep to ourselves the
profits that otherwise would go to them.
We get our most sympathy from the
ranks of the Populists. We have no as
sesments nor dues; only a dollar initiation,
fee that goes toward propaganda work.
"There are many merchants and land
lords who will accept these checks. Our
present officers are: Fred Clark, president;
Barnaby Dougherty, vice-president; C.
Warfield, manager; L. C. Clark, account
ant; Kinghorn Jones, secretary; and di
rectors, Dr. Betzel, R. Patek, Mr. and Mrs.
Ancker, Daniel O'Fitz, C. Gleeser, who ia
also State organizer.
"There has not yet been a failure in any
branch that has been started. At Sama
Paula three capitalistic concerns were
compelled to close their doors because of
the competition of local depository.
'â¢At our last meeting Friday night it was
decided to negotiate for a piece of land
suitable for building purposes on which
we will erect headquarters for the work.
"The movement is rapidly gamins pop
ularity, and we have in oar ranks soraa
prominent and substantial citizens of Saa
Francis co. "
In almost every country the howling of
a dog is regarded as a bad omen, generally

117 Geary StrÂ«Â«UWARDALL IS
OUT FOR FUSION.
The Populist State Leader
Is Ready for Any
Fair Dicker.
ALL WAITING EVENTS.
The People's Party Will Stick
to Watson Through
Thick and Thin.
SEWALL A CORPORATION MAN.
Populist Lead:rs Return From St.
Louis and Are Open to Demo
cratic Propositions.
The Populists and Democrats of Califor
nia are making sheeps' eyes at each other
as the fusion proposition daily rises into
higher view, and this interesting political
problem is daily being laid hold of by the
leaders of both parties with a firmer grip.
State Chairman WardaU and other lead
ers of the Populist party in California got
back yesterday morning from St. Louis.
. -They were ail tired out from the trip, and
frothing of political importance resulted
from their return beyond the fact that the
Populist leaders are ripe and eager for
. pome proposition for fusion from the Dem
ocrats in this State first on Presidential
â  electors, second on Congressmen, and
third on the State legislative ticket.
Chairman Alford of the Democratic
Etate Central Committee displayed b,is
eagerness for party fusion in an interview
published m yesterday's Call and yester
. day Chairman Wardall of tbe Populist
State Central Committee, who had just re
turned from St. Louis, stated that he was
. in favor of fusion if it could be brought
about without a sacrifice of Watson and
with a fair recognition of the claims of the
Populist party in California.
The political problem of fusion between
â¢ the Democrats and Populists in this Stats
"depends mainly en the following two
things: First, the understanding that may
. be arrived at within the next few days by
Senator Jones and Marvis Butler and the
two National committees, and, second, on
the understanding that may be arrived at
within the next week or two as a result
of the informal connubiating between
' State leaders that is already going on and
which will remain in operation for a short
time.
The Democratic and Populist parties in
this State are waiting to see what the Na
tional party authorities are going to do
about Sewall and "Watson, and they stand
at attention awaiting orders from the Na
tional party authorities. The leaders of
both parties are ready to so to discussing
party equities or to shaking dice, as the
party leaders did in North Dakota, as soon
as any proceeding declares the fusion
game onen.
E. M. Wardall, chairman of the Popu
list State Central Committee, returned to
San Francisco flrom St. Louis yesterday,
in company with Taylor Rogers, John C.
Gore, James A. Johnson, John S. Dore of
Fresno, and other membertof the delega
tion. T. V. Cator arrived on the morning
train.
The attitude of the Populist party of
California in the present was fairly well
expressed in the following interview with
State Chairman E. M. Wardall:
"I don't like to say much about the sit
uation in advance. Our people are straight
middle-of-the-road people and I cannot
pyeak for them, bnt I can say that I be
lieve that some satisfactory arrangement
will De made with the Democrats in this
State. Our State executive committee
will meet next Tuesday and then the im
portant matters about the party policy
will be decided.
"We are waiting to see what tbe Na
tional committees will do. We expect
. that Sewall will resign. That is what
should be done to clear the way for fusion.
I don't believe that anything anthentic as
to what Sewall will do has transpired. 1
recognize the gravity of the situation, and
I also realize, that it is unlikely that we
will get toeether unless Mr. Sewall with
draws. We know that Tom Watson will
get three votes in this State to Sewall's
one, and we feel that if we keep our man
in the field the silver Republicans and the
workingmen wiil support our ticket.
"We are willing to meet the Democrats
on a fair proposition concerning both
electors and Congressmen. It must be re
membered that Sewall has nothing in com
mon with the laboring people â the masses.
He is a banker, a railroad president, a
member of a number of corporations and
a shipowner, and one who is very unpopu
lar with seamen.
â¢'His presence on the ticket is found to
antagonize the labor element and to en
danger tue interests of Â±sryan. I think I
that the outcome will be that Sewall will
be -withdrawn. That is what ought to be
done.
"I will not, however, throw a straw in
the way of fusion. We will either agree or
disagree. But we will elect Bryan any
way." ________^___
REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
Marked Falling Off in Trans
actions for the Month of
July.
SMALL PEOPEETIES SELLING.
Handsome Pamphlet Descriptive of
Ihe City and Port of San
Francisco.
1/ the Board of Supervisors adopts the report
of the Hnance Committee fixing the tcx
levy at $1 05 then this year's tax rate
will be a very reasonable one. The State rate
has been fixed at 40 cents thus matting the
total rate $1 51, a reduction of % per cent from
tliat of 1895.
The eflect on the real estate market should
te beneficial and perhaps it will.
The market is certainly in need of a t>timu
laut of some kind, for although now and then
a dealer is found who says that business is
good, or improving:, or has lome similar state
ment to make, yet the records, which are the
only real guide to the condition of the market,
show that transfers are steadily declining in
both number atid amount.
Mngre's Real Estate Circular for last month
nhows that during the month of July there
were 207 transfers of tho aggregate value of
$758,214. In July, 1895, there were 207
ira infers of the apgreeate value of $1,188,958.
This is a falling off oi 36 per cent in the aggre
gate value of transfers lrom a year ago In
June of the present year the number of trans
fers was 241, a smaller number by thirty-six
than In July, yet the aggregate value was
$916,236, or $158,022 (about 15 per cent) more
than the aggregate value of July's transfers.
This indicates : that ' there is more business
being done in the sale of small properties than
in large ones. In the nature of things, values,
generally speaking, will not . probably go
lower, no matter whether the country is
placed upon a silver basis or remains as it is.
The wisdom oi those who invest now must be
apparent, and the owner of a few hundred or
a few thousand dollars who judiciously in
vests his money in real estate affords an ex
ample to timid capitalists that the latter with
all their credited shrewdness might perhaps
emulate to advantage. â

Advance sheets of Magee's Real Estate Cir- \
cular for July contain the following in regard
to. the money market: , .
The demand for money was not strong last
month. The banks prefer small to large loans.
Some of them, with the object of keeping a
large surplus on hand, will not now grant
large loans. Indeed, some of them are not now
lending at all. There was a time not long
since when/ as we then stated, there was hope
that our savings banks would resume loans in
the country. There is not now the slightest
hope of that, and borrowers there must pay
the country bank rates of 9 to 11 per cent.
The rates here are G A l to 7 per cent, the .sav
ings banks paying the mortgage tax. The
total number of City real estate mortgages re
corded last month was 369. of the total value
of $933,120, while there were 199 releases of ;
mortgages, of the value of $469,496. Of the !
total mortgages last month 132 were given to
private individuals; they had a value of ,
$226,105.
EEVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
Last week was a light oue all around in the
matter of transactions recorded. There werc
ninety-one transfers filed.

Wednesdayâ Grand reception and ball at
Native Sons' Hall.
Thursdayâ Grand banquet, Union-square
Hall.
Tho great chief of records being asked
why the name of Red Men was assumed,
answered: "To answer this question we
have to call to mind a bit of history con
nected with the early struggle of the
American colonies. Every one is familiar
with the injurious acts of the mother
country which finally forced the colonists
into the struggle for independence, result
ing later in the establishment of the
United States of Americaâ the naviga
tion act, which effectually ruined tbe
shipbuilding industry of the colonies; the
acts which made the manufacture of home
products impossible; the quartering act
and stamp act, which successively called
forth the fiercest indignation and resent
ment among the colonies â and societies
were formed to create a powerful resist
ance against these injurious aggressions.
Among these stood prominently the St.
Tamina Society, previously known as the
Sons of Liberty. The various branches of
this society, in carrying out the active
i scheme of their propaganda, adopted the
j guise of Indians, to which the occurrences
of December 16, 1773, in Boston, known as
the 'Boston Tea-party,' and repeated in
one or two instances during the early part
of 1774, bear witness.
After the close of the Revolutionary
War these societies, having accomplished
their object, namely : the freedom of their
country from monarchical rule, became
less prominent in public affairs as organ
ized bodies, and it was not until the agita
tion among the people arising from the
difference of opinion in regard to adopting
a permanent form of government became
the all-absorbing topic among all classes
made it necessary, in their opinion, for
their consolidating their ranks, that they
again assumed a commanding influence.
Principally to Drevent the plans formu
lated by a society of distinctly aristocratic
tendencies and regarded as harmful to the
liberty and welfare of the people known as
the "Society of Cincinnati." The first
constitution of the Sons of St. Tamina (or
Tamanend), a famous Indian chief, de
clared it was formed to "connect in in-
dissoluble bonds of friendship, American
brethren of attachment to the political
rights of human nature and the liberty of
the country."
During the war of 1812-14 the members
of the Tammany Society, under which
name it had been incorporated in New
York in 1805, offered their services in de
fense of the city of New York, and re
paired in a body to the forts, and there
performed patriotic service in defense of
the country. In other cities, notably
Philadelphia, similar acts of patriotism
were performed in the manning of Fort
Mifflin by the junior artilleries. Here the
reorganization of the society upon a fra
ternal and benevolent basis was effected,
while St. Tammany of New York lapsed
into a distinct political party organization.
It will be noticed that the title of Red
Men had not entered into the nomencla
ture of the famous Taniina (or Tammany)
societies. When reorganization was de
sired along the lines of original affiliation,
and to add to patriotic principles the prac
tices of charity and benevolence, to make
the perpetuity of the society more endur
ing, Â»nd to bring under its protective shel
ter members from all classes of popula
tion, it was natural that a new name
should be selected. 'Ihe desire to main
tain the features taken from the manners
and customs of tne Indians during the
revolutionary struggles suggested the
name of "Red Men," and this name tne
organization, formed at Fort Mifflin,
adopted.
Branches of the Society of Red Men
were established in Maryland, Pennsylva
nia and New York and scattered over an
extensive territory, as far south as Charles
ton and New Orleans. In 1834 a concen
tration of all these different branches was
effected ; they were brought under a cen
tral governing body and the name changed
to Improved Order of Red Men. As a dis
tinctively American order, whose origin
and history were closely identified with
the birth, traditions and development of
the United States, it is but natural that its
ritualistic features, as well as its teachings
and principles, should be originally and
distinctively American.
The distinctive aims of the- order are:
"To strengthen in the minds of our fellow
citizens love of country and due regard for
its laws; to keep alive the principles that
animated the founders of the Republic
during the struggle for liberty ; to perpetu
ate the memory of that great race of abo
rigines destined to soon pass away, and
emulate their nobler traits of character,
their love of freedom, their unbounded
hospitality, their devotion to those who
had been kind to them; to extend a help
ing hand to the needy; to care for the sick
and distressed; to bury the dead and assist
the widow and orphan." . â :
The Improved Order of Red Men in Cali
fornia was organized by the institution of
California Tribe No. 1 at San -Francisco,
November 9, 1863; Manhattan Tribe No. 2
at Somersville, Contra Costa County, Feb
ruary '4, 1866; - Hiawatha Tribe No." 3, Sep

DEGREE OF POCAHONTAS.
The Session of the Ladles' Branch
of the Order of Red
Men,
The fourth annual session of the Grand
Council of the Degree of Pocahontas will
meet in Red Men's Hall on Tuesday.
The Degree of Pocahontas was estab
lished as a branch of the Improved Order
of Red Men in 1886, and numbers at present
27,000 members, established in twenty
eight Stales in the Union. Its ritualistic
work is intensely dramatic and very beau
tiful, and, like that of the Improved Order
of Red Men, ia derived from the aboriginal
inhabitants of the American continent. It
therefore possesses additional charms and
attractions to all who love country and
leel an interest in its early history.
The great chiefs, Degree of Pocahontas,
are: Miss Mabel Curtis, great Poca
hontas, Nevada City; Mrs. E. T. Cruse,
great Wenonah, Stockton; Mrs. Jennie
Crase, great keeper of records, Grass Val
ley ; Mrs. A. E. GUI, great keeper of
wampum, Sacramento; Mrs. E. Brocking
ton, great Minnehaha, Grass Valley; Miss
Carrie Johnson, great prophetess, San
Francisco.
During the year the Degree of Poca
hontas adopted 300 members.

THEIR FUN OVER
ALL TOO SOON,
Why the Lady School
teachers are Feeling
Sorrowful
OPENING OF THE YEAR.
Parents Are Jubilant â Children
Are Resigned to Their
Fate.
CONFECTIONERS ALSO GLAD.
Incidents of the First Day of the
Termâ Some Classification
Changes, Etc.
To thousands of parents and pupils and
hundreds of teachers to-day is a red-letter
day. It is the opening day of the school
year in the public schools of San Fran
cisco. The teachers, married and single,
young and old, male and lemale, who
during the last six weeks have been
making the most of their vacation at the
springs, in the mountains and by the sea
side, have all returned to the City and
will to-day, reluctantly in many instances,
resume their professional duties.
If, though, the teachers are sorry that
the midsummer vacation is ended, the
parents of thousands of poor children are
sincerely glad. Many tired mothers are
relieved of a great responsibility, or,
rather, it is shifted from their shoulders to
that of the teachers.
So far as the children themselves are
concerned, they are like their teachers.
Those of them who are bright and studi
ous are only 100 willing to return to their
school studies and to nurse their ambi
tions. The idle, lazy and dull pupils, on
the contrary, detest their books and stud
ies even more, if possible, at the opening
of the terra than at its closing.
The opening of a term is a time when
the nervous system of principals are sub
jected to a severe strain. Classes must be
graded and organized and teachers are
clamorous for a change of grade or a more
desirable classroom. There are pupils to
be enrolled and others to be transferred.
In schools which were not graded on the
last day of the term there is great bustle
and activity and on the opening day the
last thing anybody thinks of doing is
teaching.
Now that it is finally determined not to
disturb the Webster Primary School a
brisk contest is under way for the princi
palship of the LeConte Primary on Powell
street, between Washington and Jackaon.
It was the original intention to give the
appointment to Miss Mary M. Murphy,
principal of the Jefferson Primary, but now
the conditions are changed. Miss Murphy
is still anxious to be transferred from Te
hama street to Powell, but it is now un
certain if she will be. Miss Daisy Crowley,
the daugnter of the Chief of Police and the
present principal of the Stanford
Primary, would also line to go to the Le
Conte.
So, too, would Miss Minnie G. Stebbins,
the acting principal. Miss Josephine
Saunders, a teacher in the Redding Pri
mary ; Miss Martha M. Galloway, a teacher
in the Cooper Primary, and Miss Eliza
beth M. Graham, a teacher in the Horace
Mann Grammar, are also candidates for
the position. Who will get it remains to
be seen, but the battle is believed to be be
tween Miss Crowley and Miss Stebbins. In
the event of Mips Crowley's succes there
would be a vacant principalship at the
Stanford Primary.
With its appropriation of only $1,000,000
the school sages will be compelled to be
economical during the ensuing year. The
idea of reducing teachers' salaries is not
entertained by any of the Directors, who
realize the unpopularity of such an action.
Retrenchment must come, though, in
some direction, and just where is the point
which is now bothering the brains of the
Board of Education.
It has been suggested that a lot of spec
ial teachers be dropped from the payroll
of the department and that the manual
training at the Polytechnic High School
be curtailed or temporarily suspended.
The principalship of the San Francisco
Normal School is vacant, it having been
successfully conducted since the death of
the late James G. Kennedy by Miss Laura
T. Fowler, the vice-principal. It may be
filled and it may not, but the name of
Mrs. Mary W. Kincaid, who in former
years was at the head of this school, has
already been suggested as a candidate for
the principalship. Several of tee direc
tors, while personally favorable to the
claims of Mrs. Xincaid, hold that under
the existing stringent financial conditions
it would be folly to fill the vacancy and
thus increase the salary expense by some
$2400 a year.
It is claimed that it would be both wise
and economical to continue the school for
at least another term under the adminis
tration of Miss Fowler, who, as has been
said, has given general satisfaction.
Miss Elizabeth E. Crowley, a teacher in
the Hamilton Grammar School, is ambi
tious to become a principal and has her
eye upon the Mission Grammar School in
case Mrs. Nettie R. Craven, the principal,
should take a notion to resign.
The opening of the term is marked by
the introduction of a few new features in
the line of instruction. A high school
class has been established at the Business
Evening School, E. C. Kilpatrick, rlrinci
pal, and evening classes will be formed, if
possible, in the Franklin Grammar aud
the Mission Grammar. These will be
temporarily under the tuition of Richard
D. Faulkner, principal of the Franklin,
and Selden Sturges, vice- principal of the
Horace Mann.
For their services they receive only $10Ja
month extra pay, and the idea is to keep
the evening schools, so far as possible,
under the tuition of trained day school
teachers.
Two of the classes of the Horace Mann
Grammar are to be transferred to the
Haight Primary and three high school
day classes will be established in the up
per story of the Horace Mann. Miss Ada
Goldsmith of the Broadway Grammar has
been appointed as one of the teachers.
The other two have not yet been selected.
It is expected tli :it the hew rules, lately
adopted by tne Board of Education, will
soon be in print and in the hands of the
teachers, who wiJl then get a chance to
â tudy them.
Two teachers at least will return to their
respective class rooms with light hearts
and peaceful minds. At the close of the
term they were single ladies, now they are
married, and despite the rule to the con
trary, they are generously permitted by
the Board of Education to retain both
their positions and husbands. The names
of these ladies are Mrs. Marquis, formerly
Miss Metcalf of the Haight Primary, and
Mrs. Wallace, formerly. Miss Harper,
Mission Grammar. V
Ail Irish x-yaugelist Speaks.
Thomas A. Bailey of Cork, the Irish Evan
gelist, who arrived iv New York three wee*s
ago on his first vist to America, spoke in the
Y. M. C. A. building yesterday afternoon. His
subject was ; 'True Liberty," which he denned
as spiritual liberty, freedom from sin and trom
bad habits. He is charmed with his reception
in this country, Soon after his arrival he was
made an honorary member of the Y. M. C. A.
of this country. Mr. Baiiey is a man past mid
dle life and was once a soldier in the British
army. He ia accompanied by his wife. To
night he will speak again in Y. M. C. A. Hall.
SCARED BY A BAND.
Dr. A. P. McCarthy's Horse Bolt* and
He and His Collector Are Thrown
Out of the Buggy.
Dr. J. P. McCarthy, dentist, 1104 Market
street, and William Burnhams, his col
lector, were thrown from a bi^gy at
Market and Powell street yesterday after
noon, and both were injured.
Dr. McCarthy had just started off from
his office in a rig which he had procured
from the Foxhall stable?, when the horse
got frightened at a passing band of music
and bolted. The doctor clung to the reins
with all his strength, but the frightened
animal continued in its mad flight.
At Market and Powell streets the wheels
of the buggy struck a telegraph pole and
the doctor and Burnhams were thrown
out. The horse ran on and collided with
a cable-car, which had the effect of throw
ing it upon its haunches, and Policeman
Royston, who was close at hand, seized it
by the bridle and kept it in subjection.
The doctor was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Bunnell stitched and
dressed a slight wound in his forehead.
He also appeared to be suffering consider
ably from the shock to his system. Burn
hams was able to walk to the drugstore
on the corner, where two or three cuts on
his hands wer dressed. The dashboard of
the buggy was broken and one of the
horse's legs was cut.
ATCHISON REORGANIZED,
Fixed Charges Are Reduced
and Money Is
Earned.
California Connections Through the
Atlantic and Pacific May Bs
Psrpetudted.
W. H. Rossington of Topeka, Kas.,
Western attorney of the Union Trust
Company of New York in the reorganiza
tion of the Atchisom Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway, has been in San Francisco
during the past week. In the great scheme
of readjustment, which involved the
transfer of stocks, bonds and securities
representing $250,000,000, the Atlantic and
Pacific was not joined with the Atchisou,
although it does not follow in the final
settlement of affairs that the interests of
these companies shall be separated. The
fixed charges of the Atohison, Topeka and
Santa Fe have been so reduced that the
road is now earning money.
Leading railroad men and attorneys re
gard the success of the reorganization as a
remarkable achievement. Much credit is
said to be due to Uuited States Judge '
Caldwell. If he had not displayed great
firmness as well as judicial wisdom the
professional railroad wreckers of Wall
street would have made sad havoc with
the vast properties.
According to Mr. Rossington's view the
Atlantic and Pacific Company is in a po
sition to defend its California connections.
The company is not compelled to sell its
road from Mojave to the Colorado River
or sell the line from the river to Albu
querque. It is possible to re-establish and
perpetuate close relations with the Atchi
Â«on, Topeka and Santa Fe.
In the negotiations for control of the
Atlantic and Pacific the Huntington in
terests may be shrewd enough to shut out
the Atchison from the Southern California
field. In that event tne Atchison would
ne forced to establish an independent line
to the facitic Coast. The old original
promoters of the Atchison system always
looked forward to a line from Chicago to
San Francisco. At one time bonds for the
extension of the road to San Francisco
could have been readily sold at a high
figure. It is now thought that the exten
sion will be advocated as soon as tne
doubt 3 and uncertainties attendinc the
present business depression are dispelled.

The Royal Arcanum.
Marion S. de Koco, deputy supreme regent of the
Royal Arcanum, in speaking of the article pub

several orders hud changed the mode of assess
ments and that level assessments could not be
maintained, said:
The Royal Arcanum has not made any change
whatever either in Its assessments or Its rates, and
If the attitude of the supreme officers indicates
anything It does not propose to do so.
The article says: "Tue Royal Arcanum at its
last ses-ion discussed th^ matter of a change of
assessments and referred the matter to a commit
tee to present a plan at iis next session." And
that is substantially all it did. The Mipreme
Council Is coinpo3i (1 t f many men. each of whom
has his boboy. and not lacking for support per
h.â¢!â -<. To capture :i join; committee and saddle It
with certain views has been done before, but that
of itself does not alter the fact mat a committee is
not the Supreme Council. Thai the majority of
the Supreme council was oppotedtoa change I
am persuaded. That the report was received I be
lleve. That it was courteously considered and as
courteous! v "shelved" is apparent from the fo. low
lowing excerp : of the proceedings (p. 74, Bulletin;,
viz:
'â After discussion the joint committee was in
smicted to turn over to the supreme secretary all
reports, books, correspondence, tables and other
papers and documents relating to the statistics of
the order which it had accumulated in its investi
gations the past three years. The thanks of the
Supreme council were eiven the comruitiee for its
persi-tent endeavor and zeal in presenting its
work, said the intelligence manifested by the re
suits shown by its reports, not only this year but
last y< ar." L'nder these conditions the creation
of a committee "to bring the matter up next ses
si"n'" can be readily understood. And now a few

WILL BE BLOWN,
Opening of the Exposition
Will Be Noised
Abroad.
EVERYTHING IS READY
The Latest Addition to the
Attractions Is a Lovers'
Walk.
WILL SURELY BE A SUCCESS.
All Improvements Suggested by Last
Year's Shew Have Been
Carried Out
Oakland Office Sak Fkakcisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Aug. 2. \
Sleepy indeed will be the individual who
13 not made aware, to-morrow morning, of
the facr that the Oakland Exposition has
opened. Steam whistles, bells, blank car
tridges and a salute from small cannon
will all be combined in a tremendous effort
to call to the minds of citizens that Aia
meda County is on show at the exposition
grounds.
In the evening the practical lessons
learned by the eye will be made more per
manent by the practical speeches on the
county's industries and products that will
be delivered by President Nelson, Mayor
Davie, Senator Perkins, Julian Sonntag
and others.
It would be a hard matter to find fault
w.ith the general arrangement of the build
ings and their contents. The tabernacle
proper has been set apart for the stages,
the auditorium, t c ladies' booth, news
paper row and refreshment booths. Last
year the splendid entertainment each
evening'was practically lest, as there was
not a spare spot to place a chair. This
year tt ere are a large gallery and a fine
auditorium reserved downstairs.
In the annex is the art display, the pho
tographic exhibits, and as many of the
standing exhibits as it will hold. In the
lar^e canvas-covered structure is the heavy
machinery, and in the most open section
of the grounds is the space for the fruit,
flower and vegetable exhibits.
"Then there is something that so far
seems to have escaped the attention of tne
many who have written of tne Dig show.
It is the lovers' walk and is on the south
side of the Tabernacle. When the eye has
been surfeited with the display of the
handsome iron wors, the pretty carpets
and the big pumpkins that Aiameda
County can produce; when the ear has
been satisfied with song, music and ora
tory; when the brain has been tormented
with the buzzing of the machinery, and
when the feet are tired from walking
around and among the multitude of hand
some booths, then tne visitors can retire
to the grassy walks, generously lined with
seats, waere tho moon and the distant
electric light will struggle for supremacy.
This idea of a lovers' walk was suggested
to Superintendent Sharpe by a young
lady, but he refuses to divulge her name.
Sue is certainly entitled to a diploma.
Although to-day is Sunday and the
doors of the inciosure are locked on the
inside, the sound of hammers by day and
the glare of electric lights by night created
more tnan a suspicion in the minds of
people going to church that tne finishing
touches were being put on. Anyway
everything is ready for the grand opening.
GEORGE NISSEN'S SCARE
He Read That He Had Hydro
phobia and Had Bitten
Many People.
A Mnnchausen Story That Originated
From the Fact That He
Owns Dogs.
Oakland OrrrcE SAuFiuycisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Aug. 2. j
George Nissen was very much surprised
to read a melodramatic story abont him
self this morning in a San Francisco paper.
Nissen learned in a very sensational
article that he had a genuine case of
hydrophobia. He was informed that he I
barking and snapping like a dog and i
biting people right and left. In fact the |
story made it appear that Nissen had i
created as much excitement and done as j
much darnajre as a half dozen mad dogs.
At the Receiving Hospital Steward
Victory discovered tnat the young man
vras suffering from indigestion and also a
mild form of convulsion, to which be has
been subject for many years. After he
had rested for a short time Mr. Nissen
â arent home, and Cc camp nearer having a
genuine fit when he read his sensational
history than he ever had in his life.
'â¢>"issen's stomach was out of order," !
said Steward Victory to-day when visitors
called to Bee the rabid case of rabies, j
â¢He had been enjoying himself yesterday
and tne heat afferted him. I understand j
he has been subject to these iij?tit attacks ;
ior years. Oh, m, he did not eat any of j
the attendants at the hospital. He went
home in time for breacfas'i.''
The geauine case of hydrophobia, from
which Mr. Nissen was imagined to be Buf
fering, had its origin in the fact that he
is fond of dogs and keeps a kennel of j
pbont a dozen.

DAVIS IS BACK.
The Pastor Preaches Hli First Ser-
man After a Lone Ab
sence.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 2. â Rev. Ed
wards Davis preached to-night his first
sermon since hia return. In his absence
Rev. Jay William fluason has filled the
pulpit of the Central Church. The sub
ject was "God's Mysterious Way." In
part the preacher said:
â¢ ; 'God's way is not man's way' has been
a demonstrated truth throughout man
kind's history. The universe is shrouded
with mystery, as the clouds obscure tne
sky. The tiny stars baffle the astrono
mer's eye, and to the microscopist unex
plored caverns exist in the atom's sphere.
Inscrutable law, force and materiality are
but partially removed from the realm of
the unknowable. In the brief course of
man's allotted time only a glimpse can be
caught of earth. But as the scientist has
seen part of the mysteries of the material
world revealed, so must he see in- abstract
thought as when in gazing into space, the
first faint gleam of brighter beams that far
more fair than the celestial stars appearâ
see the light of intelligence that shall re
| veal the wonders of the human mind.
"God can never be understood by phil
osophy. He can only bÂ« known by his
manifestations in the Savior, the cosmos,
! a flower and a tear, and especially in the
knowledge of the self, iiis infinitude can
I only De comprehended by the influence pi
J faith. Hence until we partially know
God his way; will be proportionately mys
terious, for tne simplification of mystery
presages infinite intelligence. There is
Inota life but has been led by what the
follower would call an unseen hand. Our
souls, like st<>rm-blown ships, are being
borne to quiet havens. Human experi
ence is not complete without defeat, dis
appointment, death, turmoil, trial, tri
i umph. After the ascent of Calvary,
though blind with woe, then we see the
distant scene and understand."
THE MAJOR ON PARADE.
He Wore His Cake-Walk Suit
on Broadway, According
to Promise.
A Small Boy Spoiled His Pleasure by
an Uncaliec-For
Insult.
Oakland Office Sas Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 2.
Major Waters kept faith with the fash
ionable audience who proclaimed that he
waseDtitled to the second prize at tne
Cakewalk at the Macdonongh. The ma
jor won an order for a suit of clothes
and he promised that he would be seen
wearing them on Broadway on Sunday.
He kept his word.
The wrath of Milton Johnson who dis
dainfully refused the second prize last
Tuesday night was as nothing compared
to the wrath of the major when he discov
ered that he must exercise modesty in the
choice of his garments or there would be
a misunderstanding.
It all arose out of a misconstruction of a
phrase. The major concluded that "a
good suit of clothes" meant the best in
the house. The donor of the order did not
think so. He concluded that the seven
feet of the major's anatomy shouid be
considered as having bten awarded a good
suit of clothes if the trousers and coat
were not full of windows after he had
made one of his double-action 45-degree
bends.
The major went to his closest friend and
asked him to accompany him to the
tailor. The request was granted, and the
major prepared for the ordeal of being
measured. He might have saved himself
the trouble.
The tailor got some double-length trou
sers and standing on a chair he compared i
them with the jeans the major was wear- j
ing and said, "To an inch.'' A coat and :
vest were treated the same way and with a j
"There, major," the gentleman of height
was handed the parcel.
The major expressed his surprise, and
so did the tailor, but there was no al- !
ternative and th--' major left. Ke wore
the suit to-day and "nad not been on
Broadway ten minutes before a little news- I
boy insulted him. He walked up to the
official cDimney-sweeper, smelled his coat
sleeves, and said with a look of deep dis
gust, "Fire sale, two-and-a-half." The
major is still Jooking for that boy.
THE NEW WOMAN.
Profesi or Granville Â£. Foster Sees Her |
Parallel in the Book of Cither.
BERKELEY, Cal., August 2.â "The
Book of Esther and the New Woman"
was the subject of a discourse in the North
Berkeley Congregational Church this j
evening by Professor Granville E. Foster, j
Professor Foster spoke oi the "coming !
woman," and gave ideas of what she
ought to be in the light of Biblical teach
in tr.
"I don't object to a woman voting or
taking any other part in politics; she may
hold offices of trust and honor, but al
ways as a woman," said the speaker, i
"From the example of Esther we may
judge that the true woman when she
votes will vote as a woman and in office
will hold ofiice as a woman. It is a de
plorable tendency in some women to
blame God because they were not made '
men, and expressing the blame by adopt
ing mannish ways."
Professor Foster referred to Queen Vic
toria as a notable example of a woman
who remained modest and womanly while
doing her part nobly in the poliiical
world. The character of Esther waa also
presented as a conspicuous example to
womankind.
"Science shows that woman's brain is
smaller tnan man's," said Professor Fos
ter, "but because of fineness of nerve i
cells, quicker respiration and circulation, !
woman's brain makes up in quality for j
what it lacks in quantity. Tnere.'ore tue j
average woman's bran is as powerful as ,
the average man's â though with some j
distinction as to the direction in whicn !
the power is manifested."
In dismissing the book of Esther tne j
speaker pointed out five peculiarities: |
L Many of the historical statements are |
obscure. 2. Some ot its history is at vari
ance with profane records. 3. God's name
does not occur in any form in the book,
though the object of the book is to teach
his providence. 3. The coloring of the
book is foreign, non-JewiÂ«b. 5. Though
the language of the book is Hebrew of the
sixth century, B. C, there is a large ad
mixture of Persian.
The professor gave an interesting re
view of Persian manners and customs of |
the time of the Book of Esther.
I ell From a Tree.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 2.â Edward :
Hampton, the 4-year-old son of Charles
Hampton, narrowly escaped death by an
accident this morning while climbing a
tree on Cordon ices Creek. The lad fell (
from the tree, his wrist striking a piece of
glass on the ground. A painful cut was ' j
made and the boy almost bled to death
before medical aid could be summoned. '
He was attended by Dr. Payne and is now '
out of danger. j i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 1896.
PECULIAR WORK
IN JURY-ROOMS,
| Chief Lloyd Thinks He Has
Partly Probed the
Secret
HILBORN'S BAD MEMORY
How It Caused a Big Reaction
in the Congressional
Fight
AGE PITTED AGAINST YOUTH.
An Ex-Senator's Comparison Between
the Governments of Oakland
and Denver.
Oaklasd Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 2. j
A man has been adjudged guilty of at
tempting to influence a possible juror in
OAKLAND, Cal., August 2.â These are the two men over whom the Republican
party of Aiameda County is rent asunder. Each is anxious to go to Congress from
the Third District. One of the leading arguments between the two factions is the
question of age, some preferring old age and experience ana others youth and ambi
tion. Mr. Hilborn is more than twice the age of Judge Fricb, and each is a pledged
anti-railroad man. It would be difficult at this time to predict the winner.
an important case. To-morrow he will ap
pear before Judge Greene for sen tence ana
there is much speculation as to the man
ner in whicn the Judge will dispose of the
case. During the past four years there have
been some remarkable verdicts and remark
able cases of disagreements among juries
placed on record in this county. Many
have been so flagrant in their contrast to
what the evidence had lead an intelligent
Judge and public to expect that more than
a suspicion existed that Dribery had been
practiced.
A few weeks ago a case was tried against
a gold-brick swindler in which the evi
dence was so plain to ten men out of the
twelve that they pronounced the prisoner
guilty as soon as they eot into the jury
room. Two could not see as their brethren
saw, and the usual disagreement was en
tered. As the time for the second trial
approached Chief Lloyd, for reasons which
he has not placed on the bulletin board of
his office, decided to keep a lookout on
certain people. Harry Trundle was one
of them. He was found guilty last night
ana Chief Lloyd is satisfied that there
will not be so many inexplicable disagree
ments in the jury-room in the future.
The position of the County Committee
toward Mr. Hilborn is easily accounted for.
If he has one supporter in that body it is
not easy to see who it is." Two years ago
there was an election in this couuty, and
Fred W. Henshaw wa? a candidate for Su
preme Justice. Mr. Hilborn was on the j
ticket for Congress. There was a ratifica- :
tion meeting in East Oakland, and Mr.
Hilborn referred in glowing terms to
every candidate, with one exception. The
exception was Fred Henshaw. Whether
the omission was by accident or design has
never been explained, but its result is i
plainly seen. Two years ago Mr. Hilborn {
was the unanimous choice of his party for
Congress.
Now he has a strong opposition, and the
first move of the County Committee was
to elect four delegates at large to the Con
gressional convention who will vote for
Judge Frick. The most prominent name
among the four is W. G. Henshaw, a
brother of the Henshaw whom Mr. Kil
born did not mention two years ago.
Fred Henshaw's organizers in this county
landed him in the Supreme Court by a
tremendous majority. Now all his influ
ence is turned against Mr. Hilborn and
everybody is guessing. If Mr. Hilborn is
returned to "Washington, it will be over
a road literallystrewn with political gore.
"I've learned a lesson since I went East.
The sooner Oakland learns the same
lesson and proceeds to practice it the
better for her citizens. Denver and Omaha
are an inspiration to an Oakiander. In
spite of dull times they are going ahead |
and there is a flavor of progress in the air.
In Denver everything possible is so ar
ranged as to bring revenue into the town.
If a railroad wants a franchise it has to j
come over a certain route, it has to ex
pend a fixed amount in depots at fixed
localities, and it has to stop its trains so
many hours a day so that passengers may j
see the city and have a chance to spend j
some money. The same class of restric- 1
tions governs street railroad franchises,
and the prevailing idea seems to be to
make those who wish to benefit by the
city produce something for the benefit of
the city.
"In Oakland everything is just the other
way. The city has given away every
franchise that is of any value and has got
nothing in return. All this has been
brought about by petty local fights which
have made the city government a mounte
bank show. It is very probable that before
long I may go East."
The above remarks were made by ex-
Senator Frank J. Moffit the night after
his return from notifying W. J. Bryan of
the indorsement of his candidacy by the
Silver convention.to which Mr. Moffit was
a delegate.
It is surprising how many intelligent
people misunderstand the meaning of "a
dollar tax levy." A few days ago Auditor
Snow published a statement that for the
next fiscal year the city can be run on a
tax of 95 cents. This appears to the unini
tiated as though the Auditor was going
the Mayor 5 cent 9 better than last year.
This is very misleading. Last year the
Mayor limited the levy to $1. As the bond
interest and redemption fund demand a
levy of 17 cents the Mayor's levy for run
ning the city was really 83 cents. Auditor
Snow's levy is $1 12, which, after deduct
ing the peremptory 17 cents, makes a levy
for running the city of 95 cents. Instead
of cutting the Mayor's levy 5 cents Mr.
Snow proposes to increase it 12 cents.
The Mayor spent many busy hours this
week explaining the situation to anxious
taxpayers. _^___^^______ S. W. B.

OAKLAND, Cal., Aug 2.â General W.
H. L. Barnes is to open the Republican
campaign in this city, with the first po

button which serves as a trigger. It is a
breech-loauer, the handle pulling back
from the body of the cane, and it has an
automatic swell ejector. The shotgun
cane is carried by taxidermists and others

THE PORTIUNCULA
INDULGENCE,
A Sermon by the Reverend
Father Caraher on
Its Origin.
ITS NATURE EXPLAINED.
That Little Church of St. Mary
of the Angels in Umbria,
Italy.
HOW TO GAIN THE INDULGENCE
A Franciscan Church Must Be Visited
and There Must Be Confes*
sion and Communion.
The Rev. Father Thomas Caraher,
rector of St, Francis Church on Vallejo
street, preached a sermon last night on
the origin and nature of the Portiuncula
Indulgence to a large congregation that
paid close attention to what was ex
plained.
In delivering the exordium the reverend
father said: "The reason that the epistle
and gospel are read in many churches to
day is because to-day we commemorate
the dedication or consecration to Ood of
the little church of St. Mary of the
Angels in Umbria, Italy, commonly
called the Church of the Portiuncuia. But
it is not so much the dedication of that
little church that we commemorate to-day
as the notable event with which it is so in
timately associated â the publication of the
Portiuncula Indulgence. It was the pub
lication o! that indulgence that attracted
so many thousands from various parts of
Italy to the church of St. Mary of the
Angels on the Ist ot August, 1223, and it is
the commemoration of tnat event and a de
sire to gain that indulgence that attract so
many to-day within the walls of Francis
can churches throughout the world."
As to the origin he said the word Por
tiuncula is a Latin word, signifying a small
part or portion and was originally applied
to a small plat of ground in Umora, on
which a chapel was built in the middle of
tne fifth century by four pious pilgrims
from Jerusalem, w;io named it after our
lady of the valley of Joshaphat; afterward
it received the name of "our Lady of tha
Angels," because angels frequently
hovered over it singing the praises of their
heavenly queen.
"It came iv the possession of St. Bene
dict in the sixth century and his order
heid it down to the beginning of the thir
teenth century, when they presented it to
St. Francis. As the saint was one night
praying in his cell for the conversion of
sinners, with a crucifix in his hand and a
human stull at his feet, he heard an angel
say to him, 'To the chapel, Francis, to the
chapel.' On entering the chapel he beheld
the Savior with his blessed mother and a
number of angels over the altar surrounded
with a brilliant heavenly light.
"Addressing Francis the Savior said to
him that he well knew the zeal tnat he
and his companions had displayed for the
conversion of sinners and the salvation of
souls; that he had set him up as a light
for the nations and as a support for his
church, and that he would grant him any
request be should mate. The saint re
quested a plenary indulgence or the full
remission of the temporal punishment
due to Bin to all who having confessed
their sins should visit once the Church of
the Portiuncula.
"The Savior granted the indulgence
prayed for on condition that it should be
confirmed by his vicar on earth, the sov
ereign pontiff. The following morning
the saint repaired to Rerugia, where
Honorius 111 was sojourning, and on hear
ing the facts related the vicar of Christ
confirmed the indulgence and granted it
for one natural day in perpetuity, or for
ever."
The rector then detailed the work of the
saint and said that the feast of St. Peter's
chains was selected as the natural day, or
from 2 o'clock on the first day of Aueust
until sundown of the second. This indul
gence, he said, was afterward extended to
all the churches of the three orders of St.
Francis. Jt was also extended by Papal
indult to many other churches throughout
the world, and even to everyday in the
year for the church of the Portiuncula.
"To gain the indulgence," said the rec
tor, "confession, communion and a visit
to a Franciscan church are necessary, but
it is not nece<Â«?ary to fast or give alms,
as iv the case of a jubilee. The confession
can be made on the 2d of August, or on
either of the two previous days; the com
munion can be made on either the Ist
or 2d of Aueust, but the visit must be
made between 2 o'ciocn in the afternoon
of the Ist of August and sunset of the fol
lowing day. Confession and communion
can be made in any churcn, but the visit
must be made to fcome Franciscan church,
and accompanied by sojne prayers at
option for the holy father's intention."

AN EGG WITHIN AN EGG
Freak on the Part of a Duck
That Defies the Laws of
Nature.
Does Two Days' Work in One and
Then Takes a Day Offâ Is Ad
mired by Its Owner.
E. J. Wilkinson, who owns a little farm
out on Francisco street, is the owner of a
freak duck. It is just an ordinary appear
ing white quacking duck, not a duck
within a duck, nor is it gifted with double
the amount of intellect usually allotted to
birds of the same feather. Notwithstand-
The Freak Egg Which lias Made One
ben Proud.
ing these facts, however, the freak fowl
frequently lays an egg within an egg. As
a rule the circumference of the outside
shell is about 9 inches and that of the in
side 4 incnea. The outside ejjg is identi
cal with that of the inside egg, with the
exception that the yelk is slightly flat
tened from coming in contact with the
shell which surrounds it.
This duck is in tne habit of defying the
laws of nature by doing two days' work in
one day and resting the next. At times
the two egga referred to form one within
the other and the result is that the downy
monstrosity lays a double-yelked egg
ranging ail the way from eigut to ten
inches in circumference.
Mr. Wilkinson is quite proud of his pe
culiar duck and it is safe to say that it
would take several times the value of the
bird in order to purchase it from him.

Strange Revelation of the Early Life
of a Deceased Pioneer of
Uvenuore.
OAKLAND, Cal, Aug. 2.â The story of
the death of the Livermore pioneer, Wil
liam Watkins Winn, published in The
Call about a mouth ago, has brought to
light an interesting chapter of the early
life of the deceased. In "Bnrke's Peerage"
ho appears as Sir William Watkin Wynn,
but many years ago he forfeited all right
to his title by becoming an American citi
zen. The Masonic Veteran Association
has just learned the fact and have made it
public.
Wynn was a direct lineal descendant from
Cadrod Harda of the Isle of Anglesea.
According to the coat of arms and list of
possessions in "Collens' Baronetaee" the
Wjnn family was once very wealthy and
powerful.
"FORTY WINKS."
After-Dinner Naps Conducive to Proper
Digestion.
Well-dined humanity will feel relieved
to hear the decision of the medical profes
sion that the time-honored institution of
"forty winks" after dinner is conducive to
health and a beautiful recuperative process.
Plethoric, full-blooded people have feared
to indulge in this tempting settling of a
heavy feed, several English practitioners
have made a ssvere attack on the siesta as
tending to apoplexy or nightmare, but the j
medical press declares this idea is founded
on a misapprehension of the physiological
functions of the stomach and brain. And

tion: Is it harmful thus to fall asleep
after a meal? By no means. The process
is merely a physiological one, and as such
when it occurs is quite natural. When
digestion is in progress nature arranges
that all the available blood in the body
shall be connected in and about the di
gestive organs.
Consequently the blood supply to thÂ«
brain falls to a low ebb, and thus sleep it
easily induced. On the other hand, phy*
Biologically, it is wrong for brain work ta

trine, but one that offers new development
in the attractions of dinnerparties or pub
lic banquets. How would it be possible
for guests, after tossing off the t>ousse
cafe, to recline with comfort in the
straight- back chairs of modern fashion?
Would these heavy divers be able to re
strain the snores with which nature afflicts
the children of men in their unconscious
moments? If the "forty wints" method
is to receive public and immediate post
prandial adoption another order of dining
room furniture must prevail. People who
are in the habit of dining not wisely but
too well must insist on the introduction
of the classic Roman style of couch or
trinclinia around the mahogany, and on
that extend themselves as gracefully as
may be until the digestive organs have
done their duty. Beneficent sleep! It
would work well even at the dinner dance,
for then guests, however light of foot,
would awake refreshed and their general
happiness be promoted, because indiges
tion would be avoided. â Boston Herald.

WHO OPENED THE
GATES OF LIBERTY?
Ray Palmer Gives His An
swer to the Ques
tion.
LAUDS ROGEB WILLIAMS.
Denies That Lord Baltimore Was
the First Champion of
Freedom.
CATHOLIC PRIESTS DENOUNCED.
Palmer Declares That Their Protes
tations of Patriotism Are
Insincere.
A fair-sized audience was present at the
Good Citizenship meeting yesterday after
noon in Metropolitan Temple to listen to
Rev. Ray Palmer's farewell address before
leaving this City for the East. Before
introducing Mr. Palmer, Chairman Quit
zow made a few introductory remarks, in
which he commended the audience for its
faithful attendance at the weekly meetings
and urged it to continue its efforts in
behalf of eood citizenship.
Ray Palmer was then introduced and
spoke upon the subject, "Roger Williams
Opened the Gates of Liberty."
"I wish to draw the brush of history
across the picture which the Papists have
painted on the dome of the temple of
liberty â the picture of Lord Baltimore
opening the gates of freedom." began the
speaker. "I wish to place in its place
another picture, the picture of Roger Wil
liams, the hero of Narragansett Bay, who
indeed opened the gates of liberty. Roger
Williams promulgated the doctrine which
constitutes the cornerstone of our liberty â
the doctrine which is so repulsive to
Popery ami Catholicism.
"If the immortal Williams could return
to-day he would take the oatu-bound
priests from their cells and send the old
bachelor of the Vatican from his papal
prison.
"Roger Williams stood almost on the
summit of tue Mountain of Liberty. 'He
was tiie 6rst person,' said Bancroft,
'who believed in freedom of conscience in
its fullest plenitude. He breathed fully
the spirit of Milton.'
"Here stands the man whom Rome
would have burned at the stake, here is
the man whose principles are so repug
nant to Romanism. But so long as
Rhode Island and Narragansett Bay re
main, so long as the stars ar.d stripes float
over the little red schoolhouse, just so
long shall the name oi Roger Williams be
revered.
"The American Protective Association
is founded upon the principles of Roger
Williams. lam a member of that order
and I am not ashamed that every one shall
know it. The American Protective Asso
ciation represents freedom without pro
claiming it, as the Catholic priests have
been hypocritically proclaiming.
"It behooves us as Americans to show
forth our Jiprht and be true to the princi
ples of our order. The principles of our
order are as clean and bright as t tie stars
that shine above us, and any one of our
on. J er wiiO disgraces ;iimseif makes a stain
upon the whole organization to which he
belongs.
"We cannot afford to retrace our steps
or retract what we have done as an order.
What we have don* as an order we have
uone rightly and should srand by. We
are organized not only to protect our own
flames, but to see that no child in this
land, whether he be black or while, rich or
poor, shall be brought up in the teachings
of any priest or sect.
"The American Protective Association,
comprising, as it does, the best and most
honorable citizens of this country, shouid
be the father of the oppressed, the down
trodden and the unfortunate. And as the
Jesuits will march to death rather than
denounce their base and treacherous prin
ciples so should we be willing to undergo
anything for tne sake of our glorious
principles.
"Our friend, Father Yorke, says he ad
mires Dr. Wendte. So do I. But do you
know why Yorke admires Dr. Wendte?
Because he is not an A. P. A. Although
Dr. Wendte has denounced Romanism as
loudly as any, yet, because be is not an
A. P. A., according to Father Yorke, he is
a gentleman."
At the conclusion of Ray Palmer's ad
dress a resolution of thanks was unani
mously tendered him for his loyalty in
having addressed the meeting on various
occasions while he has been in this City.

MEN AND BIRDS
WERE JAILED,
An Interrupted Effort to
Conduct a Cocking
Main.
CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.
Secretary Hoi brook and His
Men Break In on the
Offenders.

a Tug From the Arctic Oil
Works Wharf.
"The degeneration of cock-fighting in
this State is simply appalling.
"As a matter of fact.if the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals does not
keep its hands off, these would-be sports,
who don't know a stag from a cock and
who never saw a chicken heeled, will kill
the nicest entertainment a gentleman or
lady could wish to enjoy."
Con Mooney did not say this in just such
languaee, becauso the veteran of the pit is
a great deal more empnatic, but such was
the opinion he expressed yesterday.
The thine is that Mooney, once known
as the founder of and first Mayor of
"Mooneyville by the Sea," is a little bit
out of sorts. He is bedridden with rheum
atism, and yesterday he had to forego the
exquisite pleasure of watching a few
chickens cut each other's throats or stab
each other to death with two-inch steel
gaffs that look like curved and sharpened
darning needles.
Mooney and Johnny Maher, who are
about equally entitled to the palm or pen
alty lor initiating the youths of this West
ern slope into the finesse of seeing dumb
animals suffer most horrible deaths, had
arranged for a big cocking main, to take
place early yesterday morning, and to last
until either one of the two masters of the
sport had won seven battles.
There was $500 wagered on the result, a
forfeit of $50 being put up as a guarantee
ol good faith.
This affair was the outcome of the cock
ing main held two weeks ago in the Mason
distillery outside of the Sausalito town
limits. On that occasion Maber, repre
senting San Lieandro and in fact the entire
Contra Costa County, had some thirteen
fighting cocks which he pitted against
a )iKe number from this side of the bay.
San Francisco lost by one battle.
Subsequently the Mason boys, whose
barn bad been used to hold the main,
set what was claimed to be an exorbitant
rental for its use. The sum being refused
them they confiscated all the roosters they
could lay their hands on and fought them
for their own pleasure or stewed them for
their own delectation.
Mooney was undismayed by the deple
tion of his barnyard, and when he chal
lenged San Leandro for another main he
scoured this City for more gamecocks,
which he secured in plenty.
These were tne birds that were to figure
in yesterday's main, but for events that
were certainly unforeseen by many the ri
val fowls were unable to come together.
It had been decided that the main
should be held somewhere out on the bay,
away from the reach of the authorities,
so the barge Yolo was engaged at a cost of
$20, and $30 more was offered to and ac
cepted by the captain of the tiny tug
Millie to tow two roosters and the sports
beyond the jurisdiction of the local
authorities.
The start was to be made at as nearly 6
o'clock in the morning as possible, and
several days ago quiet "lips" that the main
was to be held were given out.
Potrero and Presidio sports, young men
about town, clerks, wholesale butchers, cap
italists and a select coterie of the jeunesse
doree from the Palace Hotel knew all
about what fun was in store for them.
On toot, in cars, buggies, wagons and
carriaj.es they began to arrive early at the
foot of the Arctic Oil Works pier, near the
Union Iron Works. To reach there they
had to cross the Fourth-street bridge, over
the ill-smelling Mission Creek, only to cut
through tbÂ« fouler and denser atmosphere
of the dumps farther on.
At 10 o'clock there was quite a cosmo
politan assemblage at the end of the
wharf, the kid-glove brigade freely mixing
up with the riff-raff w:iich is bound to
find its way into anything like a dog or
cock fight. But the chickens, Johnny
Maher and Mooney with their satellites,
were nowhere to be seen.
The little tug Millie was at the end of
the wharf, however, with steam up and a
hawser strung to the dilapidated capstan
of the Yoio. As a matter of fact, but for
this showing the weary crowd would have
quit the wharf and given up the pursuit of
pleasure hours before in the belief they
had been hoaxed.
Finally there was a sigh of relief when
at 10:30 o'clock Johnny Maher and a
couple of his Berkeley stockyard friends

hove in sight down the dusty road. They
drove up in an express-wagon well piled
with gunny-sacks, in which were con
tained the cnickens that were to afford the
day's fun in exchange for bruises, . cuts
and death.
The cocks wer* speedily transferred to
the barge, in the pilot-house of which the
gunny-sacks and tbeir^crowing contents
were carefully hung.
Then another tedious wait of an hour
and a half was had. Mooney had not
shovpn ud with his chickens.
'â¢Where is Mooney?" That was asked
on every side with no answer.
The hardened element waÂ« more ready
to accept the delay in good grace, but the
aristocratic contingent was restive. Three
or four coupes and carriages still remained
within hailing distance, and the young
bloods who were expected to do much of
the betting at the pit side were inclined to
withdraw. Some of them did leave the
place at 11 o'clock, shortly before
"Woodsy," recognized as "Mooney's
man," drove up in an express-wagon to
announce it would be impossible for the
ex-Mayor to show np. It was then
learned in an official way tnat Mooney's
old rheumatic complaint held him to his
bed.
Mooney, however, was willing to forfeit
his $50 put up when the main was made,
and, furthermore, he was willing to let
his birds fight for any one who cared to
back them.
But the birds were still in their barrels
far away near the new City Hall, aud were
hardly available.
After a brief consultation among six or
seven of the young bloods, Johnny Maher
being called in, it was decided that the
swells drive into town and get Mooney's
cnickens, and they departed, leaving the
crowd to await their arrival.
This move precipitated the trouble that
followed.
What appeared to be a dozen hard
working men enjoying a Sunday's outing
with rod and line had been casting for
fish all the morning from the stringers of
the wharf. Appearances, however, are
deceptive, as these inoffensive fishermen
turned out to be deputized officers of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
They had been quietly waiting to see ihe
cocking main begun so a* to arrest all the
parties in attendance, and in the distance
where they were unobserved were their
superior officers, who feared that if seen
their well-known identity would undo
them.
But when the young bloods departed in
their carriages and others in the crowd
appeared to leave in disgust at the long
wait, the deputiea on the wharf- gave the
signal.
In less than five minutes C. B. Hol
brook, secretary of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals, Frank Lane
of th 6 State society for the same purpose,
F. B. Gibson, Ed Wadham, James Young,
J. Cochrane, George Kiddermann, Louis
Moulton, Fred Boder, A. R. Fredericks,
T. A. Osborn, F. A. Holbrook, N. McCur
rie, George Delmer, W. T. Hooper, H. Mc-
Murray and T. J. Coleman put in an ap
pearance.
"We're pinched!" exclaimed an old
timer, who has on more than one occasion
been caught in similar violations of the
law.
â¢' Yo kin shake me down if de cops ain't
got usl" shouted another.
There was no use trying to escape. The
dozen deputies already on one end of the
wharf and the officers coming along in a
body from tne other left but two avenues
of escape, and they were the sides of the
pier from which the prisoners might have
jumped into the muddy waters of the bay.
The outlook was not cheerful.
"Dey can't do a ting to us," a rusty
looking individual said, picking up a fish
ing-pole which a deputy had just dropped
"We're nshin' and we ain't done any cock
fightin'."
This information was somewhat reas
suring, but not quite so. Still the penned
in culprits put on a bold front and loudly
protested their innocence.
Secretary Holbrook was undismayed and
informed his prisoners they nad been
placed under arrest for violating section
911 of the Penal Code, prohibiting cruelty
to animals.
A howl of laughter went up at this de
claration, the prisoners saying they had
not even seen apy chickens, let alone
making them fight.
The officers, however, searched the barge
and brougbt forth the game-cocks, con
fined in sacks, and construed this evidence
as conclusive.
Communication was shortly had with
the Southern police station and regular
Policemen Whelan and Royston soon
reached the wharf with two patrol wag
ons, into which the eighteen prisoners
were huddled and taken to jail.
In nearly every instance the men gave
fictitious names, but were booked lor
"making arrangements for cock-fighting,"
with bail set $40 each as follows: Frank
Conlon, Albert White, Fred Johnson,
Grover Cleveland, Edward Ryan, George
Spallacv, James Brown, James Rieley,
Peter Mooney, John Maher, John Kelly,
Daniel Harding, W. J. Burt, Louis Zehe,
John Francis Robert Johnson and Henry
Sweeney.
One amusing incident occurred when a
friend of John McCarthy came into the
prison to offer bail for him.
Stepping up to the desk, he said to the
officer in charge:
"Here's your money for John Mc-
Carthy."
"No such man arrested," was the curt
reply.
"1 know better, for I saw him get out of
the cart."
McCarthy, who had been in a cell in the
lower end of the lockup, sang out:
"I'm not herel That is, McCarthy isn't
here."
"W T ell, what is your name?" asked Cap
tain Spillane, who enjoyed the situation.
"Well, now, you've got me this time. If
I say I'm McCarthy they'll know me and
josh the life out of me for being caught,
and so 1 don't know who 1 am. What
name did I say I was?" said he, turning to
Grover Cleveland, who was his cellmate.
"What do I know about you," was the
consoling response of Mr. Cleveland, who
who was thinking of his own troubles.
Some of the would-be sports remembered
their prison names while others had to be
identified by their friends and the arrest
ing officers. However, they all got bail
and seemed very indignant at the treat
ment they received.
They all protested in the strongest
terms their ignorance of cock-fighting,and
produced the following ticket to show
that they were simply going on a Sunday
excursion:
First grand excursion around the bay Sun
day, August 2, 1896. Music for dancing and
singing. The large, commodious barge tfolo
will be neatly fitted up for the occasion B nd
will be towed by the fast steamer Millie. The
management guarantees great pleasure on this
occasion. Refreshments, wines, liquors and
cigars and clam chowder, 10 cents. Barge
and stenmer will leave the o:l works' dock, at
the Potrero, at 10 a. m. sharp, aud will return
at 6:30r. M. Committeeâ WiliiauilAkins, John
Ma'uer, Cornelius Mooney. Tickets ;round
trip), $2.
While the prisoners arrested for trying
to go on an inr.ocent Sunday excursion
were being conveyed to the police station
the young bloods who had driven off to
call at Con Mooney's place made satisfac
tory arrangements with that gentleman
and were back at the Arctic Oil Works
wharf at 1 o'clock in the afternoon with
his thirteen chickens all snugly tied in
bans and stowed away in the carriages.
In the meantime the owner of the tug
and the barge was fretting at the loss of
his $50 for their use. The money had not
been paid him as yet and he had been at
considerable outlay. When the bloods
came to the wharf with Mooney's chickens
he told them that the Maher faction and
his cnickens had become weary and had
gone back uptown.
He declared likewise that under no cir
cumstances would he rent his tug and
barge to cockfighters, as he did not pro
pose to violate the law.
This was a sore disappointment, and
threatened the culmination of a good
day's sport.
One bright chappie, however, suggested
that the tug and barge be engaged for a
few hours' spin on tne bay for "a bit of
fresh air."
The bargain was concluded, and not all
the men who started out in the morning
to witness a cocking-main left their warm
bads in vain.

terday at a meeting of politicians in
terested in timely registration. Mr. Dia
mond was 100 years of age last May and
his first vote was cast for John Quincy
Adams in November, 1824. Captain Short
stated that he was 89 years of age en his
last birtnday. He cast his first vote for
Andrew Jackson in November, 1828, just
sixty-eight years ago.
"When I went to the registration office
yesterday," said Captain Short last even
ing, "the clerk told me that one older man
had been there. I said I knew who it was.
'Mr. Diamond,' I said, and I was right.
He voted four years before I did."
The veteran captain became reminiscent
as be looked back over his three score
years and eight as a voter and he related
some interesting incidents that formed
part of his experience.
"I was 21 years of ace the day I first
voted," he continued. "It was in the
'Bloody Sixth' Ward in New York. At
that time I looked very young and the
officers of election commented on my
juvenile appearance. That's the time the
Democrats came into existence. Before
it was Republicans and Whies. A Clay
man challenged my vote on the ground
that I was not 21. 'How old are you?' the
judge asked. 'I'm 21 to-day,' I answered.
As there used to be three days' elections
then in New York I was passed without
challenge. 'He could vote to-morrow,'
said the Clay man.
"Why was it called the Bloody Sixth?
The ward got that name in 1833. A Demo
crat was running for Mayor of New York.
Word was passed around that they were
bringing 'repeaters' from Philadelphia.
General Jonathan D. Stevenson, who died
here not long since, went to Philadelphia
and sent up so many 'pipe- layers,' and so
many more 'pipe-layers,' and so on. They
were the repeaters, and it was through
them the term 'pipe-laying' originated in
politics. A committee of 100 was organ
ized to protect the Whig voters of the Sixth
Ward. Our boys met that night and got
a 'committee' to stand them off. We
boueht three cartloads of firewood that
was then used in New Yorkâ heavy,
chunky blocks â and we dumped them* at
convenient points. When the Whig com
mittee of 100 came round the wood began
to fly and the Whies flew before it. Of
course, nobody was killed exactly, but
there were a great many beads cut. But
it wasn't much trouble, the hospital was
quite closeâ in Pearl streetâ and the cut
heads were dressed there. After that it
was the 'Bloody Sixth.'
"From my first vote till the election of
Lincoln, in 1860, I voted the Democratic
ticket. Yes, sir, I was a redhot Democrat
that never crossed a t or dotted an i.
How's that?" and the captain enjoyed the
old saying of his political opponents of
long ago,
"I voted for Douglas, and when Lin
coln was elected I was thrown out of
officeâ the San Francisco Postoffice. After
the war a great Union meeting was held at
the triangle at Bush and Market streets.
Some friends of mine said to me: 'Short,
it's all over now, we are going to reorga
nize the Democratic party ; come with us
to the meeting.' They represented the
Southern end of the party. A Judge (I
have forgotten his name), who was one of
tue speakers, said that be was a Unionist,
but the victory struck deep in him. Then
I said 'The Unionist is struck deep in me
and I'm going to stay there.'
"I left that meeting and ever since I've
voted the Republican ticket. After the
election of Taylor in 1848 I came here. I
left New York January 30, 1849, and ar
rived in San Francisco after a journey of
173 days from New York. My mining ven
tures were not a success and I came back
to San Francisco from the mountains.
Taylor appointed a new Postmaster for
San Francisco, a Mr. Moore. On his ar
rival here he found three or four clerks
playing cards in the Postoffice. He
thought that a terrible thing. Of course,
he was a straight down-Easter, so when I
met him I received an appointment in the
local Postoffice. This kept me out of poli
tics, though I took an active interest in
my own party."
Captain Short is an ardent McKinley
man.
"In November McKinley will be elected,
I believe, for the people are going over to
his side rapidly," he said.
"Regarding the money question, this
country cannot go against the world."
Burglar Arrested.
James Houlton, a sailor, was arrested last
evening by Policeman Furlong, and detained
at the California-street police station on a
charge of burglary. It is alleged that Houlton
entered the What Cheer House yesterday after
noon and stole a number of sheets and sold
them for the small sum of 25 cents.
A PLEASANT JOURNEY.
The Run to Ukiah From San FrancUco
on the S. F. and N. P- Railroad.
People who desire to get a beneficial
change of air and scene by a few hours'
travel and at minimum expense can do no
better than take a trip over the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Kailroad between
this City and Ujtiah, in Mendocino County.
The journey takes five hours, and every
mile of the entire distance is a most inter
esting panorama of charasteristic Califor
nia scenery.
Trains on this road leave the City early
in the morning, reaching Ukiah, the end
of the road, at a little after the noon hour.
If desired the traveler can take the train
bank in an hour and reach San Francisco
before dark, making the entire distance in
daylight.
The scenery along this road is of the
greatest variety. For miles orchards and
grain fields line the track, which gradu
ally give place to the lumber industry and
fiefds of bright, green hops, that in their
present condition make as beautiful a pic
ture as one could desire to look upon.
Through the Russian River Valley the
scenery is a continuous change between
wild grandeur and peaceful pastoral coun
try. On one side of the track there will
be cliffs and crags that rise hundreds of
feet and on the other wide stretches of
bottom land covered with rich ranches
surrounded by plentiful harvests of the
many products of one of the most pro
ductive valleys in the world.
La Gauloise.
The French residents of this City, en joyed
themselves at Harbor View yesterday at
the annual picnic of the Gauloise Society.
The following officers of the society had
charge of the arrangements: M. Fusch, presi
dent; J. Auradou, first vice-president; J. Decor
tieux, second vice-president; E. Robinet,
treasurer; H. Fabrique, J. Merieune, J.
Godeau, trustees.
THE AMERICAN INDIAN,
How Benevolent Uncle Sam
Looks After His
Welfare.
Boys Taught How to Till the Land
and the Girls How to Cook
and Sew.
The character of the North American
Indian, like that of the heathen Chinee,
is peculiar. The Red Man is very child
ish, but Uncle Sam takes a paternal inter
est in his welfare and hopes, in the course
of three or four generations, to make him
a thoroughly good citizen.
Tne teachers of Pacific Coast Indians
will convene in this City to-day. These
general meetings were established by the
present Superintendent of Indian Schools,
Dr. VV. N. Hailmann, in 1894.
It is due to the interest and courteous
co-operation of Superintendent of Schools
Madison Babcock and the Board of Educa
tion, that San Francisco was selected for
this year's meeting in preference to sev
eral other cities.
The first meeting will occur at the hall
of the Girls' High School this evening at 8
o'clock. At the same place all the even
ing meetings of the convention will be
The business meetings, beginning at 9
o'clock in the morning and at 2 in the af
ternoon, will be held in the council-room
of the Board of Education at the City
At the meeting this evening an address
of welcome will be delivered by Super
intendent Babcock, to be followed by a re
sponse by Dr. W. N. Hailmann, Superin
tendent of Indian Schools. "The Duty of
the Respective States with Reference to
the Education of the Indians Within
Their Borders," will be discussed by the
Hon. G. M. Irwin, Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction, Salem, Or.
"The condition of the Indians has
changed very materially," said United
States Supervisor of Indian Education A.
H. Heinemann, "under the aDle adminis
tration of D. M. Browning, Commissioner
of Indian Affairs. It is the aim of the
United States to give them an industrial
rather than a literary or scientific educa
tion.
'JTbe Indians of California are located
chiefly on reservations in Pit River Val
ley, on the Klamath River, in Hoopa Val
ley, Round Valley, Lake County and
Southern California. The most of them
are trying to make their living by farming,
and Uncle Sam allots, when possible, 160
acres to every man, woman and child re
siding on a reservation. Field matrons
(white women) teach the squaws house
hold duties and the men are instructed in
farming.
"Each Indian school is supposed to
have connected with it a farm, and if
practicable a dairy also. The boys are
trained U> become farmers, carpenters,
blacksmiths, tailors, shoemakers, etc., and
the girls are taught sewing and cooking.
"The Indians in the United States num
ber, say, 250,000 and the schools 250. The
children of school age number 60,000, of
whom 40,000 attend schaol. The instruc
tion there received is of great benefit to
them ana in most instances produces a
marked change in their character and
lives."
Great Presbyterian Council.
At the Westminster Presbyterian Church on
Fell street this morning Rev. Henry E. M inton,
D.D., spoke interestingly of the proceedings of
the great Presbyterian Council, which com
menced in Glasgow last June. Dr. Minton,
who was a member of the council, has re

less Firenzi and many other mighty
racers, will probably not be seen on the
California turf the coming winter after all.
Designing eyes have been cast upon the
royally bred lot by different wealthy
horsemen, but the bookmaker has secured
the prize. It is learned that twelve of
them, all two-year-olds, have been entered
in the rich stakes to be decided during the
coming State Fair, as well as a very prom
ising three-year-old filly by Torso. Such
superb stallions as Salvator, imported
Maxim and imported Midlothian are rep
resented among the animals disposed of.
Henry Byrnes will handle the string.
'Mr, Rose is not a new comer to the turf.
In the past his rose and white colors have
been shown up on Nephew, Boreas, Ger
aldine, Ruinart, Tiger and others. The
latter colt, a son of Three Cheers, prom
ised to develop into a staxe horse, but un
fortunately broke down after winning a
stake in very impressive fashion and had
to be retired. As the horses sporting
the widely known and popu.ar penciller's
colors were invariably close up to the coin,
his present purchase will be a welcome
addition to the California turf.
Tod S'oane, the diminutive jockey who
wears a No. 2 shoe and a No. 8 hat, and
who by the way is meeting with consider
able success in the far East the pres
ent season where good lightweights are
scarcer than freckles on a watermelon, did
the major portion of the riding for Mr.
Rose last season and no doubt will be re
engaged for the coming winter campaign.
There are now nearly 250 horses quar
tered at the Sacramento track, and early
morning workouts will soon be the rule as
the time approaches for the opening of
the fair. Among the stables there with
strings of four or more horses are those of
George Rose, Joe Harvey, Al Morine,
John Humphrey, Nick Hall, Jim Neill,
DickLedgett.W. L. Stanfield, T. Boyle, the
big Spreckels string, El Primero stable,
William Murray, Charles Fair, Wilbur
Smith and many lesser lights. Archie
Stephenson recently arrived at the track
from Montana, bringing with him Blue
Bell, Faro, Norraandie and others.
Jockey Chevalier is at Sacramento in
theemploy of Joe Harvey and Charles
Fair, and it is said the California Jockey
Club folks consider favorably the move
looking to bis reinstatement.
Cuddy, the steeplechase rider who was
injured some months ago at Ingleside
track, had his collar-bone fractured while
schooling a "green" jumper one day last
week at Sacramento.
The grand list of stakes offered by the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club for its coming
winter meeting appear, to have caught the
fancy of horsemen with their rich induce
ments, and the new club can look for a
surprisingly large list of .entries. The
California Oaks, the California Derby and
the Spreckels cup will certainly become
the classic features of the far Western
turf.
Edward Macklvn, said to be a very
clever boy in the saddle, who has been
training the horses of a wealthy Burlin
game horseman for some time past, in
tends getting down, to riding weight and
will be seen in the saddle at the State
Fair.
Beginning this week with the Petaluma
fair, which place hangs up a number of
purses for the bang-tail division aa well as
for the light harness horse, there will be
an exodus of "circuit chasers" from the
City. Petaluma is holding out very
tempting inducements to horse-owners
and the fair is an assured success. Al
Leach will attend to the auction pool
selling and John Humphrey will chalk up
fat prices for the book bettors. The full
programme of events to be decided has
already appeared in these columns.
Immediately following Petaluma the
Glenn County Agricultural Association
will hold its annual fair at Willows.
Always one of the best towns on the cir
cuit Willows this year promises to sur
pass in the excellence of the sport offered
any of its race meets in the past. W. V.
Freeman, the association's hustling and
energetic secretary, reports a splendid lot
of entries for tue different trotting and
pacing events, among the lot being the
fast side-wheeler W. Wood (2:07), Waldo
J (2:08), Bay wood, Colonel Benton, Ruby
M, Loupe and Javelin. The trotting por
tion of the programme is well represented
by such excellent performers as Home
ward, Chico, Jasper Ayers, Gallette, Nut
wood Wilkes and Charivari. A number
of substantial purses will undoubtedly be
hung up for the runners also. W. P. Mc-
Nair has been engaged to do the starting.
Injuries Received on a Tandem.
Charles Birdsall, son of Police-Lieutenant
Birdsall, and William Reed, while riding a
tandem in the Midwinter Fair grounds of
Golden Gate Park yesterday afternoon, col
lided with a wagon. Birdsall received a severe
scalp wound ana an injury to his left arm. and
Reed's left ear was lacerated and his forehead
cut. They were taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where their wounds were dressed.
