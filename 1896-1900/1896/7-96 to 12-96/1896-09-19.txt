CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 18.â The largest
political gathering ever seen in Ohio as
sembled here to-ilay. Conservative esti
mates place the number of people on the
streets of Canton this afternoon and even
ing at more than 80,000. Eastern Ohio,
Eastern West Virginia and Western Penn
sylvania sent large delegations. The rail
ways were taxed to their utmost capacity
and every vehicle iD the county was
brought into service. The crowd was al
most twice as larjie as the organizers of the
meeting had expected, but it was orderly
and the people were well cared for.
At an early hour this morning the
people began to stream into the city, and
at 9 o'clock larze crowds had gathered
about the residence of Major McKinley.
Notwithstanding the other attractions in
the city, the i.ome of the candidate was
the center of interest and people clunc
about it till 11 o'clock at night. They
filled the yard, took possession of the
porches and peered in at the windows.
When one set of visitors left another im
mediately supplied their places.
Major McKinley had an arduous day.
In addition to the task of meeting and
talking briefly with hundreds of tne
people, he has had to thake hands with
thousands, make a dozen speeches, enter
tain a dozen guests at dinner and listen
to the music of thirty-nine brass hands.
The first delegation called at 10:30 o'clock
this morning. It came from Unity town
ship, Columbia County. J. J. Brittain of
East Palestine was the spokesman. In
response to his remarks Major McKinley
made a happy little speech, which was
received with great cheering and applause.
He said:
Some of tbe most distinguished men of the
country will present to you the political ques
tions that divide tbe parties, and I am sure
you will be glad to hear them. I only appear
that I may thank you, as I do from tbe boUom
of my heart, for your assurances of support
and good will. [Great applause.]
After Major McKinley had finished he
introduced Judge Howard Ferris of Cin
cinnati, who made a felicitous speech.
Judge U. L. Marvin of Akron also mad* a
short speech.
The next delegation was also from Co
lumbia County. Major McKinley's speech
to this delegation was also greeted with
tremendous applause.
When Major McKinley finished speak
ing he introduced Major W. W. Peabody
of Cincinnati, vice-president of the Balti
more and Ohio Southwestern Railroad,
wtio made one of the most stirring speeches
of the day. At half-past 12 o'clock the
Americas Club of Putsburg, escorting
General Hastings, marched up to the Mc-
Kinley residence. Major McKinley came
ont on the stand which had been erected
just inside the fence and overtopping it.
W. I. Mustin, president of the Americas
Club, introduced Governor Hastings, who
made a speech eulogizing Major McKinley.
In response to the greeting Major Mc-
Kinley said :
Governor Hastings, gentlemen of the Amerl

Home of Major William McKinley.
The San Francisco Call.
cus Club and my fellow-citizens of Pennsylva
nia: I appreciate more than 1 can find words
to express the compliment ana honor of this
call from the citizens of another neighboring
State. I am glad to give you welcome to the
city of Canton and to my home. [Applause.]
I am glad to give welcome to the Governor of
the State of Pennsylvania, Mr. Hastings
[cheers], and If he can secure for the Republi
can National ticket as large a majority as he
secured for himself [laughter and applause]
we will be entirely satisfied here in Ohio [great
cheering], for I believe he received the largest
majority that was ever given to any candidate
for any office in the State of Pennsylvania.
[.Applause.]
I do not appear, my fellow-citizens, to make
a speech, but only to express my personal grati
fication mat the famous Americus Club of
business men who stand behind them should
have turned aside from their usual occupations
to come to our city for this great opening day
of our Republican campaign. And I want you
all to feel that I regard it as a special favor and
compliment to have you with us to-day.
[Great cheeriDg.] And I trnst that our people
will give you most generous and hospitable
welcome, as 1 am sure they will, and I wish for
all of you to return to your homes after to-day's
doings are over. [Cries of "Hurrah for Major
McKinley."]
Major McKinley had hardly finished
before the Building and Trades Council of
Columbus came up the street behind
their band. As soon as the Amerieus
Club moved away from the vicinity of the
stand the Columbus delegation took its
place. John N. Marion was spokesman.
In response to his remarks Major Mo-
Kinley said:
I have been very deeply and profoundly
touched by the message which your spokes
man brings to me as your representative,
speaking of the great building and trade oc
cupations of the Capitol City. [Applause] I
recall the four years I spent in your city and I
cherish them among the most dear and pleas
ant of my life. [Cheers.] I cannot recall
an hour during my incumbency of the office of
Governor that 1 did not have the sympathy
and encouragement and friendship of the
workingmen of the city of Columbus.
Our trouble to-day in this country is that we
have not got enough work. [Cries of "That's
right."] And all of us, no matter to what pol
itical party we have belonged in the past, are
going to vote for more employment to give the
American workingman. [Cheering and ap
plause.] We have lost a good deal of work in
the last four years and we want to get it back,
and then when we get it backâ [Cries of "We
want to keep it."] Yes, we want to keep it,
and when we get it back we propose that we
shall be paid in the best dollars known to the
commercial world. [Tremendous applause.]
We do not propose to vote in favor of a money
the value of which you have got to ascertain
every morning by consulting the market
coinmn in the newspapers. [Great cheering
and laughter.] We have had no such money
as that In the past, and we do not propose to
enter on such an experiment just now. [Ap
plause and cries of "Our money is good
enough."] I thank you, my countrymen, for
this call. I appreciate the good will of the
men representing the great building trades of
the city of Columbus. I know that you will
be glad to hear from the State of Pennsylvania
and we have here on this pi tform that snlen
did Republican Governor, General Hastings.
I take pleasure in presenting him to you.
[Great applause.]
Before this delegation left Governor
Bushnell was escorted to the stand and he
was intro meedi need and made a short speech.
There was an impressive parade this
afternoon. The procession was an hour
and ten minutes in passing the reviewing
stand and it moved at a very lively pace,

the h ad of the parade. In the carriage
with him were Governor Bushnell of Ohio
and Senator Thurston of Nebraska. When
the head of the parade reached the Mc-
Kinley bouse Major McKinley left his

There was another big parade in the
evening, which Major McKinley also re

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as a matter
of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing par
ties by geographical discriminations â Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western â
whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of lo
cal interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within par
ticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You can
not shield yourself too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring
from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who
ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. â Washington's Farewell Address.

TO BUILD A SWIFT
TORPEDO CATCHER
Bid of the Union Iron
Works Lowest for
the Work.
AN AWARD TO BE MADE.
CompMcated Bids tor the Navy
Department to Decide
Upon.
GREAT SPEED OF THE BOAT.
It Must Cover Thirty Knots an Hour
and Hay All the Modern
Equipments.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Bept. 18.â The
reception of proposals for the torpedo
boats authorized by the last session of
Congress attracted an unusual crowd of
boat-builders rrom both coasts of the
United States, including many who had
not hitherto taken an interest in Govern
ment work. Among those present in ad
dition to the naval officers attached to tbe
department bureau were Wolfe & Sewicker
of Portland, Or., and Henry T. Scott of
San Francisco.
No representatives of the Missistippi
and Missouri rivers and the Gulf of Mexico,
which Congress provides might have a
boat each, were in attendance. The bids
were opened by Assistant Judge Advocate-
General Laucheimer In the presence of
Acting Secretary Mc.Aaoo, Engineer-in-
Chief Melville, Chief Constructor Hich
born and Judge Advocate-General .^emly,
and were as follows:
Fur the 30-knot boats the Union Iron
Works, Fan Francisco, Cal., bid for one at
1217,500; l!ie Bath Iron Works, Bath, Me.,
lor two at $194,000 each, and for three at
1189,000 each, and submitted another prop
osition for two at $235,000 each.
The Herreshoff Company for one at $218,
-000 and for three at $206,000 each, and John
H. Dialogue & Son of Camden, N. J., for
one at $260,000. or two nt $255,000 each.
The Columbia Iron Works of Baltimore
offered one, two or three 20-knot boats for
$49,000 each on the department's plans and
on their own designs for the same speed
at $45,000 each. The same company asked
$79,100 for 22>i'-knot vessels.
Moran Bros. <fe Co. of Seattle, Wash.,
bid $59,840 for one 20-knot boat and
$56,928 each for three of them. They
offered to take three of the 22>Â£ raters at
$94,255 each.
The Bath Company bid $80,000 each for
three ol the 2'-'%- knot boats and $123,500
each for three special 25-knot vessels.
All tbe Bath bids were accompanied by
a proposition to use bronze in the con
struction of the vessels for a sJight in
crease.
The Herreshoff Company offered three
of the 20- Knot boats for $37,500 each or
one for $40,000, and they also bid for the
223^-knot vessels as low as $80,000 each.
Their 22^-knot desi n, the exact dunlicate
of the Cusning.was offered for $92,500 each,
and with certain modifications for $73,500
each.
Wolff & Sewicker of Portland, Or.,
wanted to make 20-knot boats at $45,000
for three and 22^-knots for $75,500 each.

$227,500, and the Speed Required Is 30 Knots an Hour,
FIERCE STORMS SWEEP UTAH
The Providence Steam Engine Company
of Rhode Inland bid $51,600 each for two
of the department's 20-knot plans and
$49 ; 650 each for three of them.
Lewis Nixon of Elizabeth, N. J., made
his own design for the little boats and
asked $69,000 for one, or $69,000 each for
two.
The Charles Hillman Ship and Engine
Company of Philadelphia asked $48,000
each for two on the department plan,
and for the same John Dialogue asked
$58,500 each.
George Lawler & Son of Boston sub
mitted their own design for the twenty
knot boats, asking $54,835 for each if three
were awarded them, or $61,500 for one.
They offered 22^ knots as low as $78,800
each for three or $83,500 for one.
Many of the companies made combina
tion proposals for two of one class and one
of another, and some bidders furnished
various designs, which will have to be
carefully examined t>y ths Bureau of En
gineers before any awards are made. It
was remarkable tuat no bids were received
except from coast builders and that so few
companies competed.
On the face of the bids from a compari
son made by the officials this afternoon it
appears certain that three 30-knot boats
can be built under the appropriation, the
Union Iron Works securing the one they
wanted and the Herreshoffs the other two,
as one yard is permitted to build no more
than three boats, and the award would
allow them only one of the smallest boats,
for which they distanced all competitors.
Wolff & Sewicker are the lowest bidders
for three 22^-knot boats and the Colum
bian Iron Works are the lowest competi
tors lor either one or two. As Lawler &
Co. of South Boston propose to make
these boats larger than the others tuis
firm is apt to get at least one.
The bids of Moran Bros., Dialogue and
Nixon are very high and not likely to en
ter into consideration. Besides the three
extremely fast boats it is expected that at
least two of the 22J^-kuot boats may be
secured out of the money appropriated.
Secretary Herbert cabled Acting Secre
tary McAdoo to go ahead and award the
contracts for the three battle-ships. For
mal contracts will therefore be entered
into to-morrow with the success ml com
petitors for one ship each â the Newport
News Company for $2,595,000, the Cramps
for $2,650,000 and the Union Iron Works
for $2,674,000.

OGDEN, Utah, Sept. 18.â Ogden and
vicinity have to-day been visited by a ter
rific windstorm, which began at about
noon and is still raging. There is no ac
companiment of rain or hail, but the gale
is blowing at about sixty miles an tiour.
Trees had been blown down and plate
glass fronts blown in, but no serious dam
age occurred until 8:30 o'clock this even
ing, when a large, three-story brick ware
house, 50x10 feet, belonging to Kiesel &
Co., wholesale grocers, was blown down
and the contents tired by electric wires. A
few minutes after the crash the entire out
fit was a mass of flumes, and many smaller
buijdines were completely destroyed with
it. The building is located at the foot of
Twenty-fourth street ou Wall avenue,
near the railroad yards, and is surrounded
by numerous other warehouses. The
damage and loss will exceed $100,000.
The Utah and Northern passenger,
which leaves Ogden at 8:30 o'clock, ran
into an obstruction in the shape of falling
trees and almost every pane of class in the
cars was broken out. The train returned
to Ogden for repairs.
At this hour, 11 :30, the storm is still
raging.
There were several smaller fires, but no
damage to exceed $1000.

and vicinity caught a portion of the storm
which wrought havoo in Ogden, but little

BRYAN TALKS AT
RICHMOND TOWN
Quite a Demonstration at
the Old Virginia
Capital.
CHEERS IN A DIM LIGHT.
Thousands Crowd the Audito
rium to See the Orator
From Nebraska.
PLEADS FOR FREE COINAGE.
Baasts cf Being the Candidate of
Three Parties, but Waives
That C aim for Votes.
RICHMOND, Va., Sept. 18.â In all his
career William J. Bryan never received a
greeting so enthusiastic, so wildly demon
strative as that, given him by Richmond
to-night. Not even the reception at
Columbus and Toledo, although they
were greater by far in the attendance,
could compare in frantic excess of partsan
emotion to the manner in which tne great
audience that heard him to-night gave
him welcome, 'i'ht? candidate was whirled
away from the station to the residence of
J. Taylor Ellison, chairman of the State
Democracy, where they gave him some
thing to eat and allowed him to recover a
little from the effects of the heat.
Then he was driven to the great audito
rium of the State Expostion building. It
is said that there are 10,000 seats on the
floor, several thousand more in the gal
leries and that the capacity with every
seat occupied, every bit of aisle space
filled, is fully 13,000.
Estimates as to crowds differ widely
among those who see them, but to-nicrht
there was something by which the Audi
torium gathering might be measured, and
while few there were willing to say that
less than 18,000 people were present quite
as few would express the opinion that the
audience numbered more than 20,000.
It was late when Mr. Bryan arrived.
He blinked his eyes as he entered the big
hall from the rear of tha stage, -for all but
four jets of the electric light globes had
gone out and the first impression of one
in entering was that of semi-darkness.
And so it happened that William J. Bryan
received his most demonstrative greeting
since hi? nomination from an audience of
wbom only half cctiid hardly see his face
and figure.
The Auditorium was packed to its ut
most when the Democratic nominee ar
rived. Not another soul ccld push his
perspiring form within mr.n; ieet of an
entrance.
Mr. Bryan came on the stage leaning on
the arm of J. Taylor Ellison. He was
known in an instant. One mighty shout
went up and then grew in volume, and
kept growing until things began to get
uncomfortable with those of sensitive
ears. The applause lasted ten minutes.
Senator Daniel rose to introduce Mr.
Bryan, but at sight of his well-known
countenance the crowd went wild, wilder
even than it had when Mr. Bryan came
iipon the scene. Soon it became quiet
enough for the nominee to be , heard, bat
all through his address there were shouts
of approval, partly suppressed cheering
and much disorder that made it hard for
liis words to reach all in the halL He taid
in part:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It
gratiiies me much to find In the capital city of
this great S'.ate so marked an evidence of the
Interest wnich people are taking in this cam
paign, ido not come to instruct on the ques
tion of finance. It would be useless to add
auytnini; to that which has already been said
by the distinguished Senator who has brought
to the investigation of the money question
that abi.ity which he carried into all his work,
a::d who adds to ability eloquence to present,
and to deiend Democracy hs it was taught by
the fathers. [Applause] To such a State rep
â¢ 1 by John W. Daniel [applause] no
apostio of bimetallism need come to aid the
work of instruction. lam not here as a cam
paigner. I am simply passing through the
6iate, because I would never have come to
Virginia vrith auy thought that my presence
here was neces>ary to determine the vote of
this State. [Applause.]
I am the nominee of three conventions, but
I do not appeal to the voter on the ground
that I was nominated by his party. I have a
higher claim to yoursuffrage than party tk-s
can give mt. I apueal to you as tho only can
didate for tho Presidency who belitves the
American peopli- can have a financial policy
of their ovin. [Applause.] If there is a man
who respects party regularity he need not
complain of the manner of my nomination.
The Democratic convention which met at
Chicago represented the voter 3of that party
more truly than any convention which has
been held iv recent years. That convention
was regularly called by the regular authori
ties and delegates were chosen in every State
in the regular manner. Aud more than that,
the issue joined between the friends of freo
coinage and its enemies was fought out before
the people themselves, the highest tribunal
known under our form of Government. [Ap
plause.] The voter, not the bosses, ran the
Chicago convention. [Applause.] And I am
proud to be the nominee of the convention
which gave expression to the hopes, the as
piretionsof the common people of the Demo
cratic party.
But with all this claim to regularity I do not
ask a single Democrat to vote for my election
it, in his judgment, he believes that my elec
tion would injure his country. How eÂ»n you
tell whether a man i 3 honest wnen he tells
you that the election of the Chicago ticket
would injure his country. Any man who
thinks my election would injure this country
fan prove- it in just one way, and that is by
voting ior the Republican candidate and thu's
insure my defeut. [Applause.] Don't tell us
that your conscience would permit you to vote
the Democratic ticket and then for a bolting
ticket. The Bible tells us of the man who hid
his talent in the earth and who was con
demned because he had neelected to improve
JiiÃ opportunity. 1 want to say to you that the
ballot is given to the citizen as a sacred trust,
to be used according to his judgment and his
conscience, and that no man in the hour of
peril has amoral right to throw his vote away.
Why is it thai some Democrats or some peo
ple who used to be Democrats spend the day
in telling how the election of the Chicago
ticket would ruin this country , and then re
iuse to cast their votes for the only man who
can defeat the Chicago nomination? [Oncers. 1
I will tell you why. it is because they have
r.ot the courage to bear the odium of being
Republican?. [Great cheering.] We are en
paged in a great struggle, one of the greatest
struggles which the people of this country
v.ere r ver engaged in tune of peace. It is a
Kruczle U-tv.-'jt.-n| democracy on the one side
and plutocracy on the other, and there is no
middle ground for any man to stand upon.
[Loud cheering.] Those who are not for us
are against us. We would have more respect
lor them if they were honest enough to go
where they belong. [Cheers.] I believe we
shall win now. But whether we win now or
iiot we have begun a warfare against the gold
standard, which shall continue until the gold
Riandard is driven from our shores back to
Kng.and. [Cheers.] We have been opposed
to the importation of criminals and paupers
irom abroad, and we shall oppose the importa
tion cf a linancial system which is criminal
and which makes paupers wherever it goes.
The Republican platform at St. L vis de
clares not that the gold standard is good, but
that it must be maintained. How long? Un
til the American people are tired of it? No,
they are tired of it now. Until the people de
sire to get rid of it? No, they desire to pet rid
cf it now. How long? Why, we must maintain
it until foreign nations desire us to get rid of
it and will let us get rid of it. [Great cheer
ing.]
Iv this city, where Patrick Henry delivered
his famous speech which aroused the Nation
o arms, 1 am not afraid that the people will
tpermit a foreign financial control when more
than 100 jears ago your ancestors were will
ing to give their ;ives if need be to release the
colonies from foreign political control. We
are ia favor of the imratdiate restoration of
the free ana unlimited coinage of both gold
and silver at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1
without waiting for the aid or consent oi any
otlier nation. [Cheers.]
We are in favor oi It because bimetallism is
needed to give the people a sufficient volume
of standard money to keep pace with the pop
ulation and. business. The treasury reports
show a shrinkage of more than $150,000,000
in the currency of the people within the last
two years. The Republican party does not
propose any plan by which the volume of cur
rency shall be replenished from time to time
as the people need money. They simply de
sire the people to turn over our financial sys
tem to k few syndicates who can profit by tne
extremities of' the Government â extremities
which the syndicates have done more to cre
ate than any other cause.
We apply the law of supply and demand to
money. We say the value of a dollar depends
upon the number of dollars aud that you can
raise the value of a dollar by making dollars
scarce, and we charge that our opponents are
in invor of making money scarce became
they are controlled by those who want money
to be dear. If you own money you ought to
vote the Republican ticket. It you are in
favor of making money the only thing it is
debirab'.e to own aud making property the
thing that everybody wants to get rid oi, you
want to vote the Republican ticket, because
the Republican party proposes to continue the
present financial system, the object of which
is to make it more profitable to hoard money

PAOLI MASNACHS ANNIERSARRI.
Pennnylvanians Will Void Commemo
rative Ljcercises.
OXFORD, Pa., Sept. 18.â The one hun
dred and nineteenth anniversary of the
massacre at Paoli will be observed to
morrow, as the correct date of the anni
versary falls this year on Sunday, Septem
ber 20. The commemorative programme
will embrace speeches, martial move
ments and patriotic exercises. Governor
Hastings and many distinguished men
from other States are expected to take part
in the ceremony.
After the battie of the Brandywine the
American army moved out of tne valley
of the Brandywine. The portion of the
army under General Anthony Wayne
was ordered by Washington to lead the
advance.
On the night of the 20th General Grey
and Colonel Musgrove, with their Hessian
forces, moved upon General Wayne's posi
tion. The Continentals were surprised,
and in the retreat were shot down with
little mercy. The Americans lost 150 killed
and wounded, while the British lost only
eight. Sentimental patriots dubbed the
tight a massacre, and so It has come down
in history. Jn 1877 a splendid Quincy
granite shaft was erected ou the spot to
commemorate the event. The remains of
fifty-three of the victims of Hessian bul
lets and bayonets sleep un.er the shaft.
GROUNDING OF THE TEXAS
A Machinist Blamed for the
Mishap by the Official
Report.
The Error Admitted Without Explana
tionâNo Damage Resulted to
the Vessel.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept 18.â The
official report of Captain Glass and Chief
Engineer Moore of the Texas, of the
grounding of that vessel off Goat Island,
Newport Harbor, R. L, on the evening of
the 16lh, wa3 received this evening by j
Assistant Secretary McAdoo. It shows
that the first reports of the accident were j
somewhat exaggerated and based upon a j
wrong conception of the cause of the
grounding.
The engines were stopped as the Texas
approached the berth selected for anchor
age, and when tne port anchor was droppea
the usual signal to back whs given. The
reversing gear of the starboard engine
temporarily refused to work, and Machin
ist Hundley, in charge of the port engine,
started it at full speed ahead instead of
back, thus giving the ship an unexpected
headway, which could not be overcome
until she grounded.
Hundley -was considered a careful, com
petent man, and while admitting that he
made an error has no explanation to make
of it; he simply made a mistake. Nodam
sge whatever resulted from the mi-hap.
Mr. McAdoo will examine the reports
carefully to-morrow and later announce
the action to be taken, if any.
TESTING AN ATESHIP.
William Paul's invention Gives Promise
of Success.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 18. â WilJiam
Paul's airship, modeled after the propor
tions of an aibatross, and which the inven
tor says he can make simulate the flight
of gulls by using his body as ballast to
change the* position of the craft, was given
it.-* lirst test with dead ballast at Duue
Park, Ind., yesterday.
It covered 100 feet and settled with only
slight injury. The inventor and Chanute,
the promotor, are now satisfied that there
is no danger of the machine pitching for
ward or backward or careening sidewise,
as some aeronauts predicted. Paul will
trust bis life to a plunge off the chute this
morning if a 20-mile north wind blows.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
GREAT UPHEAVAL
IN ARMY CIRCLES
Transfers of Many Posts
Ordered by the War
Department.
AFFECTS THE PRESIDIO.
Infantry SDd Artillery Stationed
There mil Be Sent to
the South.
THE CHANGE UOT RELISHED.
Olficers With Families Will Be Put
to Much Inconvenience and
Expense.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Kept. 18.â A
prediction was made in The Call several
weeks ago that there would be a general
''shake up" of infantry troops and batter
ies of ar.'illery, and that the Fifth Artil
lery, now at the Presidio of San Fran
cisco, might be transferred to some other
point. Several days later this prediction
was confirmed by a statement made to
The Call correspondent by one of the su
perior officers of the War Department.
General Miles several weeks ago recom
mended to Secretary of War Lamort a
transfer of infantry companies and bat
teries of artiLery, and after careful con
sideration of these recommendations Sec
retary Lamont to-day issued his formal
orders. They are technical and brief, but
the Adjutant-General will in a day or two
issue a statement of the reasons actuating
the department in making these changes.
The most important transfer is tbat of the
Fifth Artillery, which, with the exception
of one battery, is now at the Presidio of
San Francisco, one battery having been
recently ordered to Fort Monroe, Va.
The Fifth Artillery has been stationed
on the Pacific Coast since 1891, and many
of the officers wiil receive the news of
their transfer with regret. The batteries
of the Fifth now on San Francisco Bay
will take the places of the batteries of the
Third Artillery, which are now distributed
along the Atlantic Coast.
The headquarters of the Third Artillery
are at St. Francis barracks, Florida, and
its batteries are scattered along the coast
at Barrancas, Fla., Fort Monroe, Va., Fort
McHenry, Md., and the Washington (D.
C.) barracks. The Third was stationed on
the Pacific Coast before the war.
When the orders in detail are published
to-morrow, as expected, it will be known
where each of the batteries of the Fifth
Artillery will be stationed along the At
lantic Coast and where each battery of the
Third Artillery will be stationed on the
Pacific Coast.
There is also a shake-up in the infantry.
The Fifteenth, now at Fort Sheridan, 111.,
is ordered to relieve the Twenty-fourth
Infantry, which is at Fort Bayard and at
other posts in New Mexico and Arizona.
Tae Twenty-fourth will be sent to Fort
Douglass, Utah, and the Sixteenth, now
at the latter post, will take the place of the
Fourth Infanty, which is now distributed
in companies at Fort Sherman, Idaho,
Fort Spokane, Wash., and Fort Boise,
Idaho.
The Fourth Infantry is sent to Chicago
to relieve the Fifteenth, now at Fort Sheri
dan.
The dispatches from Washington an
nouncing that the Fifth Artillery would
be ordered away from San Francisco to the
Atlantic Coast produce a profound feeling
of regret at the Presidio. The subject was
discussed in all its phases at the Officers'
Club and at the canteen last night. Com
missioned officers and enlisted men alike
were eager to ascertain if The Call had
received definite news that the Fifth had
been ordered to relieve the Third in the
South.
There is still a small gleam of hope that
the Fifth may be sent to New York to re
lieve the First and the First be sent to
Florida, Louisiana and Texas.
A prominent officer, whose name cannot
be published, said: "It would be grievous
injustice to send the Fifth to Florida.
Since tlie war tbia regiment has served in
the South from 1865 to 1869. and again
from 1875 to 188 L Since 1863 the First
Artillery has been South only three years.
We have been here six and a balf years,
and should remain two and a half years
longer. There is no question in my mind
that a 'pull' was exerted in Washington
and New York to get the Third out here
so as to keep the First from going South.
"It is unfair and unjust to the Fifth
Artillery, and will work a severe and un
called for pecuniary hardship npon many
of the officers, non-commisaioned officers
and enlisted men. It will cost each officer
having a family at least $500 to make the
change."
Should the Fifth Artillery go south, two
batteries will be stationed at Jackson Bar
racks, New Orleans; two at Pansacola,
two at Key West, headquarters and two
batteries at St. Augustine, two at Fort
Monroe, one light battery at San Antonio,
Tex., and one at Washington Barracks.
The officers at the Presidio who have
families are: General Graham, Majors
Darling and McCrea, and Captains
Roberts, Thorp, Riley, Hills, Wood and
McClellan, and Lieutenants Miley and
Arnold. At AJcatrazâLieutenant-Col
onel Sinclair, Captain Morris and Captain
Lomia. At Fort Masonâ Captain Vogdes
and Lieutenant Blunt.
Nearly all the bandsmen and quite a
number of the non-commissioned officers
have families.
At the canteen last night one soldier in
a croup at a round table said: "Say in
The Call that San Francisco treats the
soldier better than any other city in the
United States. Here the uniform is re
spected and citizens are kind and polite.
Some of the men, who are always pleased
I with the prospect of any change, will say
before they have been two days in Florida
that the Presidio of San Francisco is the
I most delightful post in the world. The
I going awuy will be a sorry break up for
j many of the men who have formed tender
attachments in town, but, you know, a
soldier must expect these things."
Officers who have had experience In
moving across the continent assert that
the transportation which the Government
allows is an insignificant part of the ex
pense attending a change of quarters such
as this one contemplates. Tne foreshad
owing of the transfer in a recent number
of the Army and Navy Journal was con
sidered, but it was deemed incredible that
â¢ the department should Incur the great ex
pense of sending the Fifth to Florida
when the First could be sent there at
small cost.

PILGRIMAGE TO
THE SHRINE
I Continued from IXrtt JPage.l
really a ratification of the many triumphs
that have been achieved by the Republican
candidate since he began receiving those who
call to congratulate him and themselves upon
the work of the Republicans in their National
convention. lam sure that all of us can say
that we are glad to be so near our candidate
and to contribute a little more to the busy po
litical Hie of this city of Canton.
The all-absorbing issue in this campaign ud
to this time has been that of the present mone
tary system as opposed to the free and un
limited coinage of silver proposed by the
Democrats In their Chicago convention.
The necessity of utterly defeating the Demo
cratic proposition must be apparent to you all.
The free and unlimited coinage of silver by
the independent action of this Nation would
bring financial disaster and general distress
such as we have never before known. The
maintenance of the present monetary system
is the policy of honor, and to that the Repub
lican party is committed now, as it always has
been in the past.
Governor Busbnell was heartily ap
plauded, and when he introduced Senator
Cullom of Illinois there was a storm of
cheers. Senator Cullom said:
Mr. Bryan is an out and out free-tmder as
well as for free silver. Can wo stand free sil
ver and free trade ? 1 don't want either. We
have had four years' experience of what we
may expect all the time under free trade. God
alone knows what will become of the country
if we try the experiment of the free and un
limited coinage of t liver at 16 to 1.
Fellow-citizens. 1 f oel as sure of what I am
going to say as I am that there is an all
wise overruling Providenceâ that if the people
of the United States will at "he next election
place the Government back into the hands of
the Republican party, with William McKinley
as President and with a Congress in harmony
with him on financial and tariff questions,
prosperity and confidence will come again to
the people. Do you not believe it so ? Will
you do it ? I have faith that you will.
What a period of distress for the past three
years. Plenty of money, but locked vp â no
body, in fact, wanting it or daring to invest it.
lam reminded of the lines: "Water, water ev
erywhere, but not a drop to drink. Water,
â water everywhere, but all the boards did
shrink."
Fellow-citizens, the Republican policy of
protection is still a living Issueâ it will remain
rd issue until the Wilson-Gorman bill is re
pealed and a measure framed on protection
lines is adopted and approved by President
McKinley. We reaffirm our belief in the doc
trine of protection to American industries and
industrial workers, whether in the shops, on
the farm or in the factories, in the mines,
wherever they are.
Kow, lellow-citisens, let us see about the so
called silver question. They say that gold is
growing scarcer and increasing in value ; that
gold is appreciating Instead of silver depreciat
ing, all of which makes it more Durdensome
to the debtor. Let U9 see how this is. During
the last 100 years the quantity of gold pro
duced in the world has increased from about
$33,000,000 annually to $220,000,000, while
the population has simply doubled. Let us
see further. Of the gold produced in the world
100 years ago 33 per cent was coined. Now
66 per cent is coined. Therefore the amount
of gold in the world per capita is four times as
much as it was 100 years age.
The total money in the world â gold, silver
and paperâ has increased 400 per cent during
the last 100 years. Of the money in the world
100 years ago 22 per cent was of cold; it is
now 35 per cent. As to the increase of bank
checks, drafu, etc., which go to take the place
of money, the banking facilities of the world
have increased 100 per cent.
Let us refer again to the proposition of
Bryan and Altgeld and their followers. They
say that gold Is dearer than it wis in 1873,
and that we need more money. The truth is,
for very many years the price of money has
been getting cheaocr. The legal rate of in
terest on money is less in our State than It
used to be. It has fallen from 10 to 7 per
cent, and I think men do not pay more now
than 5 or 6 per cent and the Government is
able to get it for 3 per cent and sell its bonds
at a premium, while before the war it paid 6
per cent and sold its bonds at a heavy dis
count. On the basis of 100 for wages in 1860,
wages in 1892 were 168J^ per cent â an in
crease of nearly 70 per cent, while the pur
chasing power of wages increased about 80
per cent.
Mr. Altgeld and other Popocratic leaders
say the present dollar is a 200-cent dollar,
while ihc dollar before 1873 was a 100-cent
dollar. In the first place the statement is not
correct, but if it were which would you rather
have, a dollar worth 200 cents or a dollar
worth 50 cents? They say nobody ever saw a
50-cent dollar. Nobody ever saw an American
dollar in coin that would not circulate any
where in this country and in many foreign
countries at its nominal value.
Suppose it is true that our dollars are 200
-cent dollars. How many of these have we in
circulation ? According to tne last treasury
i statement we have more than 1,500,000,000,
consisting ol gold, silver and paper, oue dollar
just as good as another, a per capita circula
tion of nearly $22. If Bryan, Altgeld and their
associates are right, tnpii our money In circu
lation is equal to $3,000,000,000, or about $44
per capita. As tfieir platform only calls for
$50 per capita they ought to be satisfied with
$44. Lot us see what would happen in the
event of the success of tho nominees of the
Chicago convention. Our gold would leave
us, to be boarded â that is certain â a contrac
tion of $600,000,000.
The remainder of our money will shrink In
purchasing power equal to the difference be
tween the par value of the dollar and the
builion price of silver. The difference is now
about 47 cents. Bo that our circulation will
be contracted to that extent and we will have
less than $9 per capita in circulation of actual
money where we now have $22.
Mr. Bryan says we would, no doubt, have a
panic at nrst after the adoption of free coin
ace. He admits that much. He doesn't say
whether it will be jast a little wave which
will wet the toes and scare the timorous or
whether it will be a tidal wave which will on
gulf the Nation. We are not children in expe
rience. We had our fiugers burned four years
ago and they are yet sore from the effect* of
the fire. William J. Bryan told us that free
trade was just what we needed; that our
troubles were all due to the tariff. He now
tells us that we must have free silver; that It
will be a crime against humanity to longer re
fuse it; that all mankind has been suffering
untold misery since 1873 ou account of de
monetization of silver.
You know better. Will you take his advice
again? I don't think you will. Fellow-citi
zens, there is no use in deceiving ourselves in
dealing with this question. We have more
gold and more silver than we ever had before
altogether, more circulating medium than we
ever had before, and \ve|have no money that is
not at par with gold, which is the recognized
money of the commercial world. Let us not
run off after moonshine theories pressed upon
us by Bryan, Tillman and Aitgela, and men
who maybe honest, but who are urging the
people of this country to adopt a policy or try
an experiment in defiance of the facts of his
tory, and in opposition to tho judgment of the
wisest friends of silver in the world.
The Republican party is for bimetallism. It
believes in the use of both gold and silver as
money. It believes in the admission of botn
to the mints of the United States on equal
terms as soon as it can be done with safety
and honor. Our party is pledged to it in the
bt. Louis platlorm.
Senator Cullora was iollowed by Senator
Thurslon of Nebraska. A most enthusi
astic greeting was given hiai and his
speech was interrupted by applause at
almost every period. He said :
.My Fellow-cltisens: lam glad to meet you
here at the home of that illustrious American,
our nominee for President, William McKinley,
bravo in war, eminent in statesmanship, the
best living exponent of those American
policies which insure National and individual
I prosperty ; it yet remains for the crucible of a
Presidential candidacy to fully test the fine
gold of his character.
War proved his soldierly qualities; a quarter
of a century of legislative and political con
tention developed, strengthened aud disclosed
his wisdom, patriotism and leadership. But
now for tho first time his countrymen can
realize and understand the sweet, simple,
sublime character of the man. And, fellow
citizens, what a contrast is there between the
two candidates now presented for yoursuffrage.
One, nominated amid the excitement and
hysteria of emotional frenzy, a triumph of
prearranged spectacular and oratorical red
fire, a nomination not thought of an hour be
fore and regretted an hour after. The other,
nominated in obedience to the ripened and
deliberate judgment of the people themselves,
whose spontaneous uprising in his behalf at
tested and emphasized their belief in the
principles for which he stands, and their sin
cere confidence in the ability, integrity, pa
triotism aud statesmanship of the man. One
notified (id accordance with his own request)
in that great show garden of New York City,
designed expressly for circuses, menageries,
horse fairs, dog shows and chrysanthemum
exhibitions, amid the blare of trumpets, the
glare of electric lights and the incessant tramp
of disappearing hosts; the other at his humble
fireside in an unostentatious manner, the
simple ceremonies witnessed only by his inti
mate friends. One now steeplechasing through
the country in a mad scramble for place and
power, fearful that some elector may escape
the witchery of nis fluted voice; the other
dignified (as befits the exalted place to which
he worthily aspires), trustfully and calmly
waiting in his own home while the Nation
comes to him.
One has selected for his arena the sandlots â
his appeals are to the passions ana prejudices
of men. The forum of the other is an Ameri
can dooryard; his rostrum is the porch of an
American cottage; his words, simple and force
ful, are addressed to the intelligence, the con
science, the patriotism and the common-sense
of a brave, thoughtful, just and hopeful
people.
My countrymen, these comparisons are not
unjust, nor aro they overdrawn. They meas
ure the infinite distance between the party
and that platform of Altgeld, Tillman, Pen
noyer, Llewellyn, Waite, Coxey and Bryan and
the party and platform of Harrison, Allison,
Reed and McKinley. This is not an issue be
tween Republicanism and Democracy. The
Chicago convention was not the council cham
ber of the Democratic party. The nominee of
that convention carries the regular banner,
but it was wrested from true Democracy by
the Populist and the commune. If true
Democracy lives its future historian will trace
its title through the Indianapolis convention.
If true Democracy dies its monument will de
clare, "Assassinated at Chicago."
My countrymen. I come to you to-diy in
spired not only by hope, but by the knowledge
of certain Republican victory. Three weeks
ago I was in my native State, Vermont. In
every time of great public danger Vermont
has responded to the call of duty. When
Sumter was fired on one of hpr great Demo
crats, Paul DilliÃgham, said "There shall be
no Democratic party in Vermont until the
Union is saved." Her people are as patriotic
in 1896 as in 1861, for with a menace to the
integrity of tne Nation and the welfare of her
people her ereatest living Democratic states
man, ex-Minister Phelps, now says it is the
duty of every tru3 Democrat to place country
first and to maintain its financial honor as
agaiust any party platform. When Vermont
spoke she spoke not alone for her Republicans,
but for her true Democracy as well.
In Maine 1 found the State afire with Repub
lican enthusiasm, ready to stand where
Blame stood, for sound money, protection and
reciprocity. And what a mighty answer
Maine has given to the Chicago platform!
Vermont and Maine are agricultural States.
a large majority of the people are farmers;
the descendants of men who have for genera
tions battled with the sterility of the moun
tainsides and won a fiugal livelihood by in
cessant toil. Vermont and Maine are the be
ginning of the end. The same intelligentn t con
sideration of the present issues by the people
of the country will produce the same result.
Not in Arkansas, Alabama or Georgia, where
majorities are made by those entrenched in
power to suit the necessities of the Democratic
party, not perhaps in those five silver States
where a local interest at the time being pre
vents a fair consideration of the great National
problem, but in every other State of the Union
where the ballot-box registers the conscience,
the judgment and the patriotism of the elect
ors, there will be the same erlorious result.
I visited Massachusettsâ rich in its memories
of Plymouth, of Lexington, of Buukar Hill
Massachusetts, which gave first blood for inde
pendence and for the Union, and I found Mas
sachusetts without regard to party lines al
most unanimous for McKinley. And then to
New York, which Bryan calls the enemy's
country, but which is not and will not be an
enemy's country to any man who stands for
the institutions, the welfare aud the honor of
the United States. And in New York I thought
of grand John A. Dix, who said: "If any man
haul* down the American flag shoot him on
the spot."
In times of peace we have no bullets for the
political enemies of our country, but we have
ballots; an 1 New York, the great Empire
State, the Gibraltar of true Democracy.will over
whelm the Popocratic aggregation by at
least a quarter of a million majority. And
then through Maryland and Virginia and
Wwt Virginia, all sacred ground, drenched
with the blood of the two great armies; and
then to Indiana, the State of Morton and Har
rison. And, my countrymen, they are all for
McKinley, even old Virginia.
1 understand that Mr. Bryan said on his re
turn to Nebraska trom his last starring tour
that Ohio was safe for 50,000. I believe it. I
have no doubt of it. Yes, for 100,000, but not
for that kind of a William.
My friends, political quacks have been offer
ing cureails to .the people ever since the
world began. There is a subtle charm in every
promise of something for nothing; of property
without payment; of accumulation without
toil; of bread without the sweat of the brow.
It is impossible to realize what a charm there
is in the word free when coupled with a party
policy or a political promise. The policy of a
tariff for revenue only would not have lasted
its first disastrous experiment and overthrow
if it had not been for the term "free trade."
The rjolicyof opening our mints to and placing
our National credit under the silver product of
the whole world would not carry one precinct
in the country If it were uot for the specious
suggestion of free silverâ something for noth
ing â the hope neld out to those who toil that
in some way, not explained or understood,
they are to have a share in the vast stores of
silver money when coinage and silver are free.
Free to whom? Will it bo free to any man
in the State of Ohioâ to any man who tolls
upon a farm or In a shop? Will it be free, ex
cept to the owners of silver mines and capital
ists who can purchase silver bullion for coin
age purposes? Will it be free except to those
who can secure the cheaper money with which
to buy your grain or pay your wages? What
is free coinage of silver? Tne silver advo
cates say it is simply placing the stamp of the
Government upon the coin to attest to its
weight and fineness. If this were all we would
not for a moment oppose their plans, for the
coins would deceive no one and would imme
diately go upon the market as the bullion
goes, at their commercial value.
The bullion-owners couid not force the peo
pie of this country to accept such dollars, and
such coinage would not be of any possible
value to the mine-owners, but this is" not what
they propose.
They insist, and the Chicago platform de
clares, that they shall have tlie right to bring
all the bullion ot all the world, all now
coined and uncoined in other countries, all
now mined and all the vast stores yet un
discovered in the rn-umains, to our mints and
have it coined at our expense and returned to
them with & law attached compelling the peo
ple of this country to accept all dollars thus
coined as full legal tender lor all debts, public
and private; lor all products sold; for all
services rendered; for all labor done, at 100
cents on tne dollar. The man of the factory,
the mill and tho shop cannot coinp.i tlie
mine-owner to accept his lubor at a double
price. Why should tiie mine-owner be gives
the right to compel the wage-earners and pro
ducers of the country to accept their silver
product at double its "market value? Will free
coinage result In a depreciated dollar? Mr.
Bryan at his Madison-square Garden meeting,
before all of the audience had left, declared
that in his belief opening our mints to the
free and unlimited coinage of the world's sil
ver would immediately advance the price of
silver from 68 ceuts per ounce, its present
bullion value, to $1 29 per ounce, iv coinage
value in gold.
la there anything in history or the experi
ence of mankind to justify such a belief? Can
the American people afford to chance the busi
ness, the business prosperity of this country
and of its 75,000,000 people, to the Delief of
any man, however distinguished, when that
belief is in direct opposition to the accepted
judgment of mankind? As Mr. Foraker has so
well said, "Can we afford to make an experi
ment station of the White House ?"
What is the free coinage ef silver? There
are many people in this country who actually
believe that under free coinage our mints wiil
be a sort of Government thrashing-machine;
that the mine-owners will ieea their bullion
into the front end while the people stand
around the other end of the machine and the
dollars run out into their pockets. Such is not
the case. Of all the bullion that will be
brought to our mints not one dollar will go
into the treasury of the United States. We,
the people, will pay all the expense.* running
the machine and the same men who feed the
bullion into one end will hold the bag into
which the dollars tall at the other.
'You may open yotir mints to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver when the mine
owners of the world, witu the dollars we coin,
can build a pyrami t whose apex reaches to
the eternal stars, and when it is bullded and
completed there is not one man in the United
Slates who can take just $1 from that pile un
less he has 100 cents' worth of labor or the
product of labor to give in exchange, and
whenever a man in this free country has an
opportunity to exchange his labor or his prod
ucts for money he ought to insist upon receiv
ing in payment the best dollar that the civil
ized world affords.
The silver advocates tell us we have been on
a gold basis since 1873, and we admit it. Is
there a mortgage in the State of Ohio which
bears a date prior to 1873 ? Has not every
dollar that has been borrowed by an Ohio
farmer, or by any Ohio man, on note and
mortgage, been paid to him in gold or money
equivalent to gold? Is it just that he should
pay in any other money than that he has bor
rowed? But when do the mortgages of the
farmers and mechanics become due?
The ordinary term of a mortgage on real
estate is from three to five years; very little
money is borrowed for a longer term by small
borrowers. Your time to pay is coming soon.
Where will you get the new cheap money in
which to pay? Is it possible that all the
farmers of Ohio will be prepared when their
mortgages come due to pay ti.cni off, principal
and Interest, even in money worth 50 cents on
the dollar? The fact of it is, my countrymen,
you do not expect to pay and you cannot pay
your present mortgages when they become
due. You will be prepared to pay the in
terest, you may be prepared to pay part of the
principal, your hope is to renew from time to
time at the same or at cheaper interest rates,
and gradually, year by year, pay off until
your entire indebtedness is canceled. But you
are now asked to vote for a policy which will
drive capital out of the country. When your
mortgages come due if you are not ready to
pay iv full you caunot ienew, certainly not at
as favorable rates as you have now.
There was another big meeting at night
in the tent. The speakers were Governor
Hastings of Pennsylvania and Repre
sentative McCleary of Minnesota. Both
speakers were enthusiastically received.
Several delegations called at the close of
the afternoon meeting. To the Akron
delegation, one of the largest that visited
the city, Major McKinley said:
I was especially delighted to see the great
delegation from Akron in the parade to-day.
It occurred to me as I saw you passing the re
viewing stand that you had not left anybody
at home. [Applause.] I tm sure your pres
ence here has contributed much toward mak
ing this a most successful meeting, and per
sonally I feel especially honored to see you
come over in such large numbers on this our
opening day. This is one of the largest politi
cal meetings, if not the largest, ever held in
the State, and it is only the opening of the
campaign, and as I said in 1893, at Akron,
when I looked over an audience of fifteen or
twenty or more thousand people at the open
ing of the campaign, my second uomination, I
said if this is the opening, what will the close
be? And so I thought to-day as you were pass-
Ing. I thank you for your calL [Great ap
plause.]
It was quite dark when the Elkins
Cadets and a large delegation from Salem,
Ohio, called.
Major McKinley was tired and had gone
to his room to take a short nap. The
bands played six or eight marches and he
gave up the notion of slumber and made
two more speeches. Judge Ambler of
Salem made a short address and Major
McKinley responded in a few appropriate
remarks.
Major McKinley then turned to the El
kins Cadets. He was heartily cheered.
After the tumult had subsided he made a
speech of welcome and was greeted with
rounds of applause.
Major McKinley entertained Senators
Cul'.om and Thurston, Governor Hastings,
Governor Bushnell, Congressman Mc-
Cleary and a dozen Canton friends at
dinner this evening.
MARRISON WILL SPEAK.
Jirpublicans to He Aided, by the Eloquent
Ex- President.
CAICAGO, 111., Sept. 18.â Benjamin
Harrison will make some campaign
speeches in October, and tne fears of the
Republican National Executive Commit
teemen at Chicago headquarters were set
at rest to-day by tne welcome intelligence.
It came this afternoon in the form of a
personal letter from the ex-President in
the Adirondacks to Committeeman Dur
bin of Indiana. Mr. Durbin would only
say the letter contained a promise to make
some speeches. The dates and places will
be fixed after Mr. Harrison has communi
cated with Mr. Durbin, and the Indiana
committee will be ignored in the matter.
One of the speeches will be in Indianapolis.
Mr. Harrison will go to New York in a
day or so to remain a week or ten days,
and the speaking engagements will be
made as soon as the ex- President returns
home.
Commttteeman Cyrus Leland returned
from Kansas. Mr. Leland said: "Watson
has done lots of good for the Republican
party by coming to Kansas and making
hiÂ» fiery anti-Sewall speeches. He had
small crowds to begin with, but they
quickly increased, and the result will be
that the 'middle-of-the-road' Populists in
tend to put up a separate Bryan and Wat
son electoral ticket, which will split the
Populist vote for Bryan."

LONDON, Ekg., Sept. 18.â The Con
stantinople correspondent of the Standard
telegraphs that the situation there does
not give any evidence of improvement.
He says: "We are on the verge of |
crisis. The ooiuion is that unless a British
fleet appears shortly in the Bosphorus
either Turkey will totter to her ruin, fall
ing into the hands of the Czar, or a Rus
sian fleet will take advantage of some
special outrage and of tho apathy of the
powers to occupy the Bosphorus, and
from that vantage ground, which we
ought to be now bolding, dictate terms to
Europe. All the British residents are
astonished because a fleet does not come.
Mass-meetings to express the indigna
tion felt against the Sultan were held to
night in Birmingham and other cities in
England. Resolutions were adopted which
in general terms called upon the Govern
ment to take immediate and active steps
to end the reign of terror in Turkey.
In Bristol and elsewhere amendments
to the resolutions were offered urging
Great Britain to act forcibly alone if nec
essary, but these amendments were de
feated.

ASSEMBLY RECORDS INDORSED
Staley and Price to Be Returned to
the Lower House of the
Legislature.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 18.â The Re
publican County Convention met at
Sebastopol to-day to nominate two Supe
rior Judges, two Assemblymen and three
Supervisors. The weather was cold and
disagreeable, but not so the 163 delegates
and the several hundred spectators. They
were filled with the warmth of generous
enthusiasm and cheered themselves hoarse
on the slightest pretext. The convention
was held in Jansen's Hall, which is also
the headquarters of the McKiniey and
Hobart Club. Back of the speakers' plat
form a huge American flag was draped,
and a handsome lithograph of the next
President Bmiled indulgently upon the
admiring throng. Mottoes and flags
adorned the walls and the odor of thou
sands of flowers filled the room.
The convention was called to order by
W. F. Price, chairman of the County Cen
tral Committee. Mr. Price welcomed the
delegates to Sebastopol in a neat speech,
and made a hit by saying that from the
smiling good nature of the crowd it would
seem as though there had been additional
news from Maine and Vermont. R. M.
Swain of Santa Rosa was elected chairman
by acclamation and J. M. Striening of
Santa Rosa and J. R. Denman of Fetaluma
were choseu secretaries. Mr. Swain
thanked the convention for the honor and
at once proceeded to the business at band.
Tne following appointments were made:
Committee on credentialsâ First District, B.
F. Campbell, chairman; Second. S. G. Graham;
Third, M. J. Hatch; Fourth, E. \V. Biddle ;

Denmau; Second, J. K. Camin ; Third, J. M.
btriening; Fourth, J. C. Holloway, chairman;
Fifth, H. M. Leburuii.

trict, I'avid Risk; sjecond, N. King; Third,
Ji' arj Bilvenhield; Fourth, J. W. Rose, chair
man; Fiftu, \V. J. Cunningham.
When Chairman Swain called the after
noon session to order there were quite a
number of women present, and Mrs. Dr.
Hurlbut was led to the platform. She
requested the convention to include in its
piatform a piank favoring tbe passage of
the equal-suffrage amendment. Her re
marks were greeted with cheers. The
platform adopted affirms faith in the Re
publican platiorm adopted at St. Louis
and p;edges support to McKinley ana
Hobart; indorses Senator Perkius, Con
gressman liarnam, State Senator Holio
way and Assemblymen Price and Staley;
opposes tiat money and condemns loose
business method-) in county affairs. Low
taxation is deru&naed, save for road pur
poses, lor which ample provision should
be made. Tue platform also calls for pro
tection to the dairy interests.
Nominations for Superior Judge being
in order Sheridan Peterson nominated
Albert G. Burnett of Santa Rosa. Sena
tor Holloway nominated Judge Crawford,
one of the incumbents. F. Breitenbach
placed in nomination Judge Dougherty,
also one of the Judges now serving, and
George P. McNear nominated W. B. Has
kell of Peialuma. The first ballot re
sulted in the election of Messrs. Dougherty

The gentlemen selected for judicial hon
ors are both young n>en of fine attain
ments and great popularity. Jud^e
Dougherty was elected beiore by the larg
est Republican majority ever given in this
cmnty. Albert G. Burnett has served
tins county two terms as District Attor
ney, receiving an unusally large vote at
each election. He is considered the most
polished and eloquent speaker in the
county.
The nominations for Assemblymen
wpre quickly made, resulting in thÂ« selec
tion ot the two members now serving â W.
fc. fetaiey of Kenwood and W. F. Price of
i-'orestville.
The Supervisors nominated are Herbert
Austin, H. L. Bagley and T. C. Putnam.
TULARE COUNTY SAFE.
Republicans Will Win in a Storm- Center
of Populism.
TULARE, Cal., Sept. 18.â Tue Tulare
McKinley club is growing rapidly and be
coming a formidable factor in advocacy of
sound money and the predominance of
Republican principles. It holds meetings
regularly in the clubrooms in Harris'
Hall, where the members discuss the
money problems brought out as the cam
paign progresses. Just now they are dis
cussing the 16 to 1 proposition advocated
by the Bryanit.es, and demonstrating the
fallacy of the idea. Next week they will
discuss "The Effect of Free Silver on
Wages."
Much interest is being manifested by the
members of the club, and in this cam
paign of education a well organized and
efficient club, such as this one, can accom
plish much for the cause of' protection,
patriotism and sound money.
This is the largest political club ever
organized in Tulare, now numbering 225
members, every one of whom will not
only V"te but work for McKinley and the
Republican ticket. They are being openly
assisted by prominent Democrats, who
have signed the roil, burning political
bridges behind them. A number of Popu
lists have recently arrived, at the con
clusion that ttiey are not in favor of 53
-cent dollars and are getting ready for the
political hurricane by signing the Mc-
Kinley roll.
Tulare, in the very storm center of Popu
lism, is absolutely safe for McKinley and
Hobart. The fusion and trading about
are doing much to drive many followers
of the silver iolly into the camp of the
sound-money advocates. There are more
Sound-money Democrats than at first sup
posed, and these, to a mail, declare their
intention to vote for McKinley. Nine out
of ten Sound-money Democrats of Tulare
will vote for M Kinley.
SAN RAFAELO INFANT PRODIGY.
Six- Tear- Old Willie Rhndey Indites a
Letter to McKinley.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Sept. 18.â The sen
timent favoring Republicanism and pro
tection is so intense in Marin County that
even the children become oracles for the
principles McKinley advance 3. The most
prominent instance of this patriotic pre
cciousness is the case of little Willie
Rhodey. This youngster is only 6 years
â¢ of age, yet often during the evening he
may be seen surrounded by old folks,
expatiating for their enlightenment the
improvement that would be made in the
present condition of affairs in this coun
try should McKinley be elected in Novem
ber.
He is, in fact, an ardent admirer of Mc-
Kinley, and believes thoroughly in pro
tection. He is also a stanch defender of
the qld soldier who fought in the civil war.
Yesterday, filled with the importance of
his ideas, he sat himself down and in
dited tue following letter to William Mc-
Kinley himseli:
Mr. William McKinleyâ Dbab Sir: I am a
good Republican. I hope you will be elected.
I think there is plenty of money around the
country for the poor man. Be sure of protec
tion and don't' forget the old soldiers. They
should be taken care of. I do not think
Bryan is in it. Yours truly,
Willie Rhodey.
What makes this, letter particularly re
markable is the fact that Master Rho ley's
parents are illiterate people, not given
much to the discussion of things political.
Willie has never attended school, but has
acquired his ability to read an<l write
wholly through his own efforts. He talks
with the gravity of a man of 40. He was
asked yesterday why he was a Republican.
He replied, "Because the Republicans
know what's right. There is lots and lots
of money in the country, but a man can't
work to get any of it. Protection will
give everybody a good chance to work,
and then they won't be poor any more."
Fusion in Fresno County.
FRESNO, Cal., Sept. 18.â The Demo
crats and Populists held their county con
ventions yesterday. They united in two
Assembly districts, the Democrats in
dorsing the Populist nominee, George W.
Cartwright, in the Sixty-second, and the
Populists the Democratic nominee, L. W.
Moultrie, in the Sixty-third. The con
ference committees could not agree as to
the division of the three Supervisorial
nominations, and no fusion was reached.
The Democrats nominated W. R. Fur
nish. G. W. Beall and J. H. Sayre, and the
Populists D. C. McDougal, W. P. Man ley
and W. R. Neil. George E. Church was
the joint nominee for Superior Judge.
Shasta'n Republican Rally.
SHASTA, Cal., Sept. 18.â OM Shasta
blazed with bonfires this evening and giant
powder salutes shook the surrounding
hills. The demonstration was in honor of
Congressman Barham and Colonel J. H.
Roberts, who addressed the most en
thusiastic Republican meeting held here
in many years. The speakers were ap
plauded at every turn, and their patriotic
utterances carried the crowd by storm.
This precinct is sixteen to one for Barham
and McKinley, and promises to sustain its
reputation as the banner Republican pre
cinct of Shasta County.
Cutler Speak* at Si* ton.
SISSON, Cal., Bept. 18.â F. A. Cutler,
fusion candidate for Congress in the First
District, opened the campaign at this
place to-night, speaking to an audience of
about 150. As a campaign effort the speech
was only ordinary and its effect seriously
crippled by efforts to make his hearers be
lieve that he had tried to evade the nomi
nation, but that it had been forced upon
him. He was followed by 3. H. Campbell
of Humboldt County, a Populist, but a
great part of the audience left after the
close of Cutler's speech.
De Vries at Georgetown.
GEORGETOWN, Cal., Sent. 18.â Marion
de Vries, candidate for Congress on the
Democratic ticket in the Second District,
opened his campaign here to-night with a
speech delivered before the Georgetown
Brvan and De Vries Silver Club. Not
withstanding the threatening aspect of
the weather the speaker was greeted by a
fair audience. He was listened to with
attention and frequently applauded.
Seattle Palmerites Rmtify.
SEATTLE. Wash., Sept. 18. âThe
Sound-money Democrats of this city held

Durie. The speakers were greeted by an
enthusiastic audience, many ladies being
present.
Pacheco at Santa JTn's.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 18.â Ex-

Committeeman St. John says that if the
other precincts throughout the State are
doing as well California is solid for Mc-
Kinley.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896,
SAN JOSE JURORS
FIX THE PENALTY
Allender Will Hang for
the Killing of Miss
Feilner.
FIRST DEGREE MURDER.
The Twelve Jurors Arrive at a
Verdict After Two Hours'
Deliberation.
COOLNESS OF THE CONDEMNED.
Declares He Was "Railroaded to
Death" by Means of False
Testimony.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 18.â Harvey Al
lender will hang for the murder of Miss
Walburga Feilner. That was virtually the
verdict returned by the jury this after
noon and unless the Supreme Court inter
feres the sentence will be executed.
At the opening of court this morning
District Attorney Herrington commenced
his argument to the jury, which lasted
until noon. Judge Lorigan then charged
the jury and at 12:25 it retired to deliberate
upon a verdict. At 2:30 â after two hours'
deliberation â the jurors came into court.
The courtroom was crowded to the doors
and many were unable to gain admission.
The verdict of the jury was greeted with
applause. It was, "We the jury find
Hatvey Allendei guilty of murder in the
first degree, as charged in the informa
tion."
Allender was unaffected by the verdict
and during the reading of it his face
maintained that stolid look that has char
acterized iiim during the trial. The jury
was polled and each man answered in the
affirmative. Judge Lorigan set next Fri
day for passing sentence.
The crime of which Allender was con
victed was a cold-blooded and premedi
tated one. On Sunday afternoon, August
9. he met Miss Feilner and Venanz
Crosetti, to whom the girl was engaged,
walking along Third street. Between Santa
Clara and St. John, aud shot and killed
them bot'i. Allender rode up to the
young couple on a bicycle, and after say
ing a few words to Miss Feilner drew a
revolver and shot tier through the heart.
As she fell Crosetti jumped for Allender,
and the latter shot him. Crosetti fell,
and then rot up and ran across the street
to the Empire engine-house, where he
fell and died almost instantly. Allender
then walked up to Miss Feilner's body
and fired a couple of shots into it. With
a theatrical display be then placed the
pistol to his head and fired, the buliet go
ing through the rim of his hat. He
dropped as though shot and lay as dead
until taken to the Receiving Hospital.
When the City Pnysician ordered Allen
der's clothes removed to search for a
wound, Allender jumped up, saying, "If
there isn't a wound in my head, you need
look no further.""' The murderer was then
locked up in prison. It is supposed Allen
der feigned death for fear the mob, which
quickiy gathered at the scene of the shoot
inc. would avenge his victims' death.
While being locked ud after the render
ing of the verdict, Allender complained
ol being "railroaded to death," and that
"most of the testimony given was false."
The verdict meets public approwal.

attorneys. '
CAPTURED NEAR MURRAY
Emil Leville Wanted at New
Orleans for Alleged
Wife Murder.
Atrocious Crime Charged Against a
Scion of Crescent City
Aristocracy.
PORTLAND, 0r.,. Sept. 18.â Detective
if. L. Loose of New Orleans passed through
ere Jast evening from the Cceur d'Alene
country, having in charge Emil Leville, a
young man belonging to one ot the oldest
families in the Crescent City, where he is
wanted for two serious crimes. This offi
cer has been on Leville's tracks since the
latter part of July, tracing him from point
to point until last Monday, when he loca
ted Leville about two miles from Murray,
working with some prospectors who were
ignorant of his antecedents.
Leville is not more than 28 years of age,
but if he is guilty of the offenses charged
to him he is a monstrous criminal. De
tective Loose said that in January last his
prisoner married an accomplished and
beautiful young woman living about
seventy-five miles south of New Orleans.
ThÂ«!y did not get along very well, and
Leville returned to New Orleans.
A few days later his relatives were
startled by the disclosure of a forgery by
him of his father's name for $18,000. This
forgery was in the form of a note, which
the young man vainly hoped to take up
on the date of its maturity by means of a
cotton deal he was engineering.
The elder Leville settled the matter; a
truce was patched up between the sepa
rated couple and Emil went to live with
his wite ; s people. Their relations were
more pleasant than during the earlier
days of their marriage, but in June last
they were forever interrupted by the death
of Mrs. Leville, who passed away very
suddenly one night.
A few days after the funeral Leville
stated his purpose to go to Europe, as he
needed a change of scene.
Instead of crossing the Atlantic, he
came West, and it seems that he had good
cause for trying to conceal bis future ad
dress.
On the Ist of July, a promissory note
for $9500, alleged to have been made by
Emil's wife, was presented to the admin
istrator of her estate, who chanced to be
one of her brothers. He immediately pro
nounc'-d it a forgery, and refused to
schedule it among his sister's liabilities.
Young Leville was at once suspected of
the forgery, as he had been guilty of one
just a short time before, and this circum
stance raised a question w* to the cause of
Mrs. Leville's death. Her remains were
exhumed and traces of morphine found in
her stomach. That is why Leville is under
arrest.
ROMANCE OF COLUSA.
A San Francisco Woman Claims She Is
Bertrand Seub's Widow.
COLUSA, Cal., Sept. 18.â In 1883 Ber
trand Seub, a saloon-keeper and business
man of Colusa, who was always supposed
to be single, made a will giving his estate
to his legal heirs, two brothers and a sister
in France. He made J. Grover and Dr.
W. H. Belton executors, and put into the
will a request that bis jewels and little
personal effects should not be sold, but
given to his friends aad others. Grover
has since kept the will. For three years
past Seub's health had been failing, and
last week he was taken suddenly ill, dying
on Saturday.

having heard of his death. She claims to
have been his wife under a contract, which
she says be had in his possession. She
has letters and papers to prove her claim
and will endeavor to do so. She remained
here until noon to-day and then returned
to San Francisco. She does not claim the
existence of another will, but will try to
prove her rights as a widow. She nursed
and cared for Seub for years whenever he
was in ihe City, which he visited fre
quently of late. His estate in valuable.
LOS ANGELES EXPOSURE
Interior Department Accused of
Aiding the Southern
Pacific.
Lending No Support to the Govern
ment in Prosecution of Land
Cases-
Los Angeles Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway. >â 
Los Angeles, Cal., Sept. 18.)
The few persons who were in attendance
at a session of the United States Circuit
Court in this city to-day listened to a very
spirited controversy between J. H. Call,
special Government counsel in a suit
against the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company affecting its title to large nold
ings of lAd in this State, and William
Singer Jr. of counsel for the road. This
was the day set to hear argument in this
important case, in which about 3,000,000
acres are involved.
When the case was called Singer asked
for a continuance, and in support of his
request said that the bill of complaint, as
filed by Call, covered much more land
than had been considered in the answer.
He said he was in possession of corre
spondence from the Interior Department
that justified him in the belief that the
Department of Justice contemplated an
early dismissal of the case. He was going
on to read a certified copy of a letter from
the Interior Department purporting to
give the facts of the litigation, prefacing
it by saying that it made some reflections
on Call, which : c declined to read.
Call interrupted Singer and objected to
the reading of this correspondence, claim
ing that the Interior Department had
nothing to do with the case. After en
tering in detail upon the attitude of the
Interior Department in the iand-.:rant
litigation. Call stated that that depart
ment hud not lent its active support to
the Government in the prosecution of the
suits. It had, even while this suit was
pending, issued patents to some of the
very lands in controversy. The case, he
said, might lon^ ago have been disposed
of if the Government bad not been met
with delays at every stage. The Attorney-
General had instructed him to submit to
no further delays, but prosecute the case
to a finish.
Judge Ross ruled that he could take no
notice of the correspondence. Here was
a suit brought by the authorized counsel
for the Government, who stated that his
instructions were to prosecute it. He cer
tainly was entitled to recognition to bring
the suit and have his averments passed
upon. He denied the motion of counsel
for a continuance and directed the argu
ments to proceed.
Call opened tue argument on behalf of
the Government and presented the case
elaborately this afternoon.
STRUCK B Y AN ELECTRIC-CAR.
Colonels Xortham and Otis /Sustain Slight
Injuries.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept 18.â Colonel
R. J. Northam and Colonel H. G. Otis, the
editor of tha Los Angeies Times, were
severely shaken up this evening in an
electric-car accident, both receiving slight
injuries. Since the destruction of his
place at Miramar Colonel Northam and
family have resided on Figuero street.
This evening, shortly before 6 o'clock, he
invited Colonel Otis to occupy a seat with
him in a top carriage. The horse was a
mettlesome animal and the two gentle
men were sent along Broadway at a lively
gait.
A short distance soutn of Sixth street a
delivery wagon was bitched near the side
walk. A carriage in front of Colonel
Northam's rig turned out toward the car
track for the delivery wagon, and at the
same time Colonei Northam's coachman
turned toward the track to pass the larter
vehicle. At this moment an electric-car
approached at a rapid rate and struck the
rear of Colonel Northam's carriage and
turned it over. Colonel Otis was pinned
on his back under the carriage, while
Colonel Northam was sent whirling,
through the air. The latter suffered a
slight contusion on the forehead from
striking the curbstone and Colonel Oiis
complained of a severe pain in the shoul
der. Both went home without assistance.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 18.â
Yups (Chinese) are at in once again, which
means that the old and bitter fued between
the See Yups and Sam Yups, which or
iginated years ago in San Francisco, and
has already caused the shedding of con
siderable blood, is about to be renewed in !
this city in a more violent form than ever.
The present is a fight between commercial
bodies, not tribes, as in the case of the
tongs recently at war with each other here.
The local Yups' tight had its origin in
the shedding ot blood also. Thia occurred
many years ago, during a fight in which a
See Yup man was killed. A Sam Yup
man was arrested by the police. The Sam
Yup commercial body came to his assis
tance and attempted to get the See Yup
organization to let him go.
They offered a great deal of money hut

VALLEY RAILWAY
ENTERS FRESNO
Construction Forces Work
on Diana and Q
Streets.
ONE MAN IN THE WAY
J C. Shepard Secures an Injunc
tion to Check the Line's
Progress.
DEMANDS HEAVY DAMAGES.
His Case Pressed by a Southern Pa
cific Attorney â First Wheat
Shipment
FRESNO, Cal., Sept. 18.â The claims
for damages made by property-owners
along Q and Diana streets, over which the
Valley road is to pass in this city, have
been settled with the exception of
that of J. C. Shepard. He resides on Q
street, a block from the depot site, and
demands $2500 for alleged damages to
property worth about $4000. He has been
offered $1000 by the railroad company.
The grading of the road into the city
from Beimont, where it stopped until the
claims for damages were settled, was
commenced this morning, and rapid
progress was made. The tracklayers were
close behind the graders.
Shepard at once instituted injunction
proceedings through L. L. Cory, the local
attorney of the Southern Pacific, to re
strain the railroad company from ''digging
up and otherwise interfering with the use
of said street, and laying rails thereon for
the purpose of a steam railroad." It is al
leged that the property will thereby be
greatly depreciated in value and damaged ;
that such damage and depreciation will
exceed $2500 in value.
The plaintiff, therefore, prays for the
juilgment and decree of the court that the
defendant company be forever restrained
and enjoined from constructing and oper
atinir any steam railroad whatever on Q
street in front of plaintiff's premises.
Judge Risley granted an interim injunc
tion, and set Monday next, at 9 a. m., as
the time for hearing the case. Attorney
Preston of the Valley Road, who in is the
city, accepted service of the injunction.
Copies were also served on the foremen of
the grading and tracklaying gangs.
Attorney Preston stated that he expect
ed to quash the injunction on Monday
morning. Shepard has been the chief in
stigator of the movement of the property
owneis along Q and Diana streets to
present claims for damages for the pass
ine of the railroad in front of their places
and sentiment is strong against him. The
amount offered him by the railroad com
pany is a fair one in comparison with
those his neighbors received.
The injunction did not interfere with
the con?truction of the road. The graders
will not reach Snepard's place until some
time next week, and by that time it is
hoped to have matters arranged so that
they can proceed to the depot site. The
grading teams are at present engaged in
making a fill at the junction of Q and
Diana streets. The roadbed along Diana
street, which connects Beimont with Q
street, is almost completed and the track
laid most of the distance. A force of
twenty teams and seventy-five men is at
work.
The construction of the road into this
city is a source of much gratification to
the people of Fresno. They have been
waiting anxiously for a few weeks for the
work to be resumed from the Beimont
terminus. Many have visited the con
struction outfits to-day. W. C. Edes is in
charge.
A joint committee from the Chamber of
Commerce and the Hundred Thousand
Club met this evening and decided to hold
a celebration when the first regular train
should arrive in Fresno from Stockton.
The programme as arranged will consist
of a big parade, a barbecue at the depot
grounds, and an electrical display by the
San Jo;:quin Company in the evening.
The committee is, of course, not in a po
sition as yet to fix the date for holding the
celebration.
Trattic Manager Moss has authorized
Local Agent C. A. Harp to accept ship
ments of grain from Fresno at the follow
ing prices: To Stockton, $2 15 a ton; to
San Francisco and Port Costa, $2 65 a ton.
For the present the grain will be shipped
from the Beimont terminus.
To the Kutner-Goldsiein Company is
due the honor of making the first ship
ment from Fresno over the competing
road. This morning it sent the following
telegram :
Fresno. Cal., Sept. 18.
John Moss, Traffic Manager San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley LaiUoad Company, San Fran
cisco: Wire us permission to ship car of wheat
to Fort Costa over company's line to-day.
KcTNER-GoLDeTKiN Company.
The following reply was promptly re
ceived :
Stockton, Cal., Sept. 18.
Kutner-Ooldstein Company, Fresno, Cal.: We
commence to-day to receive grain at Bdmont
avenue. Rate to Stockton, $2 15; Port Costa,
$2 65 per ton, carloads. John Moss.
During the afternoon a car standing on
the Beimont switch was loaded with
twelve tons of wheat, in the presence of a
large number of representative citizens.
Banners were then 3trung along the top
of the car reading: "First carload of
wheat shipped over the Valley road from
Fresno by the Kutner-Goldstein Com
pany." The car and spectators were pho
tographed. The wheat will go to Contra
Costa.
The railroad company has sent out cir
culars calling for bids for the construction
of a brick freight deDOt in this city. The
bids are to be in by September 28.

POINT LOBDS ACCIDENT
Probably Fatal Wounding of a
Young Hunter From San
Francisco.
Careless Handling of a Shotgun Re
su ts in the Loss of an
Arm.
MONTEREY, Cal., Sept. 18. â Point
Lobon, eleven miles from this place down
the coast, is noted for its peculiar forma
tion of rocks, picturesque scenery and its
fine hunting-grounds. After the^famous
seventeen-mile drive it is the chief point
of interest to all tourists who visit Hotel
del Monte, Monterey and Pacific Grove,
it overlooks the old Carmel Mission,
founded in 1770 by Padre Junipero Sena.
Some of the oldest Indian families liveing
hereabout have a horror of this point, and
say that it is hoodooed, especially on cer
tain days in the year, and that if any one
visits the place on these days some mis
fortune will befall him. However true
the prophesies of these old Indians may
be many accidents have occurred there,
and always on these particular days. The
last "hoodoo" time was only a day or two
ago, and the person that came under its
influence was F. B. Evans, a young man
in the employ of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s ex
press as shipping agent at San Francisco.
Evans was here enjoying his annual
vacation in hunting and fishing. He met
with a sad accident, wtiich curtailed his
pleasure and will, even if he recovers, un
fit him for further labor at his post.
Wiien starting for home, after enjoying
some fine shooting on Point Lobos, he was
putting his pun into the wagon when it
vas accidentally discharged, the whole
charge entering his arm at the elbow,
tearing away part of the bone and inflict
ing an awful wound.
The young man was brought to Monte
rey, the nearest point, as quickly as pos
sible, and the wound was carefully dressed.
he was taken to San Francisco yesterday
morning. The doctors say there is no
possible chance to save his arm.

DARING ROBBERY
AT SACRAMENTO
With a Cobblestone a Thief
Breaks His Way to
Jewels.
PLATE-GLASS WRECKED.
Smashes a Window and Seizes
Trays of Gems Displayed
Within.
TRIPPED AND MADE CAPTIVE.
Diamonds, Emeralds and Topazes
Snatched Up by a Crowd of
Spectators.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 18.â One of
the most daring attempts at robbery
planned in this city for years was made
this evening, and several people are the
possessors of diamond, emerald or topaz
rings which cost them only the trouble of
picking them up from the gutter, while
thÂ« would-be thief is an occupant of one
of the City Prison cells with a badly
lacerated hand and wrist.
As A. Gerlach, manager in K. Wach
horst's jewelry-store on J street, between
Third and Fourth, was engaged in remov
ing the trays of diamonds and other jew
els from the show-window shortly after 7
o'clock a man hurled a 15-pound cobble
stone through the plate-glass win
dow, shattering it from top to bottom.
He then reached in and caught up a tray
of rings. Gerlach seized a light cane and
struck the robber over the head, snapping
the frail stick in two. Without heeding
the blow the thief started to run up J
street toward Fourth.
The crashing of the splintered glass
drew the attention of all the pedestrians
in sight, and as the thief ran by Hogan's
restaurant, a few doors above the jewelry
store, William Hogan, who was standing
in the doorway, threw out his foot and
tripped the runner. He fell to the side
walk, scattering the gems in all directions.
Without attempting to guther his plunder
he sprang to his feet and ran across the
street. He was captured by E. F. Foroau
and Howard Cook, who conveyed him to
the police station, where he gave the
name of Frank Holden and was placed
under lock and key.
Holden is a stranger to the members of
the police force, but has been seen around
the racetrack for the past two weeks. He
was evidently rendered desperate by ill
luck in guessing the wrong horse.
As soon as his capture was effected the
crowd began a search for the scattered
plunder, with the result that but nine
rings out of the thirty-five that had filled
the tray were recovered, the rest having
mysteriously disappeared. Wachhorst
states that the tray of rings was worth
about $2000, and that his loss is at least
$150 U. Three years ago a similar attempt
wns made on the same establishment, and
at that time the robbers captured nearly
$8000 worth of jewelry, which was never
recovered.
The police have learned that, during the
grapple with the robber, a man and a
woman who were passing the spot picked
up the tray and many of the rings and
disappeared. It is not believed that they
were confederates of the robber, but
rather that they will either hold out for a
reward or dispose of them on their own
account. Later a man entered the West
ern Union Telegraph office and endeav
ored to pawn a new diamond ring for $10,
but was unsuccessful.

ful if Adam's demand can be avoided. It

policemen and constables in town for two
weeks to serve the subpenas.

SANTA MARIA DEL MAR, Cal., Sept

Bine die this afternoon at Hotel del Mar.
"It is all over now," a delegate remarked,
â¢*Â»nd we are happy and aatisfiecl that the

the entire approval of all members of the
Catholic Ladies' Aid Society. Certainly
they are sure of the commendation of the
Santa Cruz branch, and for very good rea
sons, in view of the reception given them
last night by their sisters of Santa Crnz.
This was beyond doubt the most delight
ful experience of the delegates during
their visit here, and it was the talk of
everybody in I>.l Mar to-day.
When the Jadies at rived at the Sea Beach
Hotel they were ushered into tha parlors
overlooking Santa Crnz strand. Beautiful
flowers and evergreens were everywhere
to be seen, for the reception committee
had decorated the handsome apartments
with masses of blossoms. Lieutenant-
Governor Jeter delivered pn address of
welcome to the ladies of the society. He
commended their charitable work and the
purposes for which they were organized,
and said they could congratulate them
selves on their place of permanent meet
ing by the reaside, and Santa Cruz could
be congratulated in having the ladies as
neighbors and frequent visitors.
Mr. Jeter's words touched a responsive
chord in his audience, and he was cor
dially applauded. He presided during the
reception and introduced Mine. Stella
Lind and T. W. Kelly, who sang delight
fully. Hiss do St. Hubert played a violin
solo, and between numbers selected music
was discoursed by the United States In
fantry band.
The reception committee consisted of
Mrs. J. H. Logan, Mrs. J. G. Cooney, Mrs.
George Bowes, Mrs. Mageie Tait, Mrs.
Thomas Brady, Mrs. Thomas O'Neil and
the Misses Jennie Mnlhern, Kate Handley,
Mary Neary and Josie Reardon.
After the conclusion of the musical pro
gramme the bail began. Captain O'Con
uell, U. S. A., and Miss de St. Hubert led
the grand march. Dancing was continued
until midnight, when a charming moon
light ride along the cliffs to Del -Mar was
enjoyed.
The ball was managed by J. T. Stanton,
J. H. Leonard, J. \V. Kelly. Dr. Cristal,
J:. s. Tait, W. D. Tait; floor committeeâ
G. R. Tait. Charles Gillen, Enoch Alzina
and John Sullivan.
The first business of the Grand Council
this morning was the selection of San
Francisco as the place for holding the
next convention, in September, 18y7. The
salaries of grand treasurer and grand sec
retary were not changed, although there
was some discussion upon the advisability
of altering them. As the constitution was
assuming the character of the California
codes, through amendments arising from
exigencies of new conditions, new consti
tutions were ordered printed and dis
tributed. It was decided that any mem
ber of the Grand Council not appearing at
its sessions should be considered ineligible
to any office in its gift.
Votes of thanks were tendered to Mrs.
M. J. Lohse, founder of the society; Mrs.
J. G. Cooney, senior grand vice-president
of Santa Cruz; Catholic Ladies' Aid So
ciety No. 13, and Young Men's Institute
No. 12, Santa Cruz, ana to the Rev. P. C.
Yorke for his interest in the society's
headquarters in San Francisco. Miss
Marcella Fitzgerald of Gilroy was dep
utized to convey the thanks of tue ladies
by letter to Bishop Montgomery, Father
"iorke and Father McNamee.
At the afternoon session a report upon
the management of the Hotel del Mar and
land was presented. It recommended
that the grand president, Mrs. Margaret
Deane, be empowered to name seven trus
tees to manage the property. This recom
mendation was accepted in slightly modi
fied form. The grand president will se
lect three members of the board of trus
tees from the grand directors and four
from owners of lots in the Del Mar Tract,
the seven to have full control and man
agement of the property.
The earnest desire of the Grand Council
is that no effort will be spared by the
hotel and land trustees to raise the mort
gage of $5700 within a year, and further
more that the tract be beautified. So
much has been done in this direction that
it is believed another year will mark great
strides forward in this Catholic seaside
resort.
The committee on order 0! business rec
ommended that the usual parliamentary*
form of proceeding in the Grand Council
be adopted, and the report was accepted.
Regarding the password of the order, it
was decided that members of ju borainate
branches be entitled to the password until
suspended, and that the password be given
audibly by the branch president to mem
bers either upon initiation or at the insti
tution of a branch.
The reports of the Grand Council were
ordered printed in the proceedings, ana
with a rising vote of thanks t j Mrs. Loer.n
of Santa Cruz and to the trustees of Del
Mar the convention was adjourned sir.c
die.
TERRIBLE DOMESTIC INSGEDE.
An loien Farmtr Kills Hl* Deserting
Wife and. Himself.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Sept. 18.â A domes
tic quarrel begun in lowa resulted in a
terrible tragedy in this city to-day. - S. J.
Keller, a farmer from lowa, came to this
city this morning in search of his wife,
who had deserted him. He. traced her to
St. Joseph, and evidently knew where to
look for her, for early this afternoon He
located her in the southern part of the city.
There was little said by the couple when
they met. The woman, who evidently
feared him, c tar ted to run when she saw
hint. He pulled out a revolver and fired
at her with fatal effect, for she fell dead to
the floor.
Almost at once he turned tbe revolver
on himself. The bullet almost tore off the
top of his head, and he fell dead beside
the body of his wife.
CROSS ARRIVES AT STANFORD.
The Coach - Sizes Up" the Men Who
Aspire to Varsity Football Team
Positions.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., Sept.
18.â The big Stanford coach and trainer of
the Stanford football team, Harry 1\
Cross, arrived' this morning and brought
with him a feeling of encouragement and
enthusiasm. He spent the morning look
ing over the grounds and getting
acquainted with the players, whose efforts
for the coming months he will direct
His appearance at Encina was the signal
for an overwhelming demonstration of
student satisfaction, with which the big
fellow was evidently pleased. In talking
over the prospects and plans for the
coming season Mr. Cross said:
"What do I think of the men? Well,
that is a little bit premature, as I haven't
seen all of them yet and none of them
lined up. But so far as 1 can judge Stan
ford has excellent material for an eleven.
The men are blÂ£, stout fellows and look
like bard-workers and as though they all
took good care of themselves. If that is
the case it won't taKe long to get them
into condition fcr putting us a strong
game, and I consider eight weeks amply
sufficient for training a team."
As to the character of the training, the
coach said that he didn't believe in long
or violent training.
"What I want to do is to keep the men
at regular work every evening just so long
that they are not tired out. 1 desire to
liave tne men eager each day for the next
day's practice and to keep up interest in
that manner. Much responsibility, of
course, rests with the boys themselves.
They must appreciate the "game and re
member that they are working for their
college'! reputation on the athletic field.
This should be sufficient incentive for
them to play a good game and train con
scientiously. 1 don't believe, however, in
having the men worn out each day â that
results from overtraining."
Speaking of the line he said : "We will
devote special attention to making the line
impregnable. Yale has always relied more
on straight football with a strong line than
on trick plays with an uncertain line. 1
shall follow out that policy here ana teach
the fellows few or no tricks. They never
wort well in tight holes and the good
strong game is what counts."
Cross doesn't have much use for gym
nasium work for football men ; he believes
the men improve in wind, endurance and
muscle more by outdoor exercise than in
door work.
"Will you put on a suit and get Into the
play occasionally?" was asked.
"Well, not at once," was the answer.
"Later, however, 1 expect to play with the
fellows to teach them what 1 can by per
sonal opposition in the line."
Cross will be here until after the Dig in
tfircoilegiate game on Thanksgiving. He
is stopping on the campus, where he can
oversee the men's work. He is delighted
with the location of Stanford and its entire
make-up.
This evening he had the men at a regu
lar practice game for a half hour, before
which the candidates were punting the bail
under bis supervision. He expressed him
self as very favorably impressed with the
work and appearance of the players.
AWFUL MURDER IN KANSAS.
A Seamstress Hacked to Death With a
Hatchet While in Bedâ Robbery
the Motive.
LAWRENCE, Kans., Sept. 18â An atro
cious murder was discovered this morn
ng when neighbors of Miss Martha Mc-
Coy entered her room to ascertain why she
had not made her appearance as usual.
They found her lying on her bed mangled
in a horrible manner, while the bed itself
was saturated with blood, which had
dripped on the floor and formed a pool
there.
A single glance only was needed to show
that a dreadful crime had been com
mitted. Lying on the bed close beside the
body of the unfortunate woman was a
hatchet, its blade and handle all blood
covered, while the dreadful gashes in the
woman's head showed how effectively it
had been nsed.
The alarm was at once given and the
police took possession of the premises, but
were unable to discover any clew to the
murderer. From the condition of the
body when found it waÃ evident that the
woman had been dead several hours. The
murder was probably committed about
midnight or shortly afterward.
Miss McCoy was a seamstress. She had
worked hard and bad accumulated consid
erable money, a lartre part of which she
kept in her room. It is supposed that the
murderer learned that fact and entered
the room during the night for purposes of
robbery. Miss McCoy probably awoke
while the man was at work, and to save
himself he killed her. He had ransacked
her room and had evidently secured the
money for which he had searched.

RUINART WINS AT
THE STATE FAIR
Vinctor Beaten by George
Rose's Great Three-
Year-Old.
FINISH IN SLOW TIME.
Backers of the Brutus Horse
Heavy Losers to the
Race.
THREE FAVORITES IN FRONT.
Little Cripple Shows His Old-Time
Formâ Horsewomen Ride for
Prizes.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 18.â The
fact that Bookmaker George Kose's great
three-year-old Ituinart and the record
breaking Vinctor were to try conclusions
at a mile attracted another big crowd to
Agricultural Park to-day. Interest was
chiefly centered in this event, and there
was some heavy wagering on the race.
The opening betting favored Ruinart at
odds of 4 to 5, with 9 to 10 chalked against
the Brutus horse. The only other starter,
Grady, was a 00 to 1 shot. The race as
run proved Vinctor to be many pounds
from nis best form. Both horses closed in
the ring at 9 to 10.
Vinetor took the lead from Grady after
a Quarter had been traveled, showing a
neck before Ruinart at the end of six
furloug.-j, covered in 1:1b. Freeman then
gave Ruinart his bead, and the brown
fellow walked past Vinctor and won with
his rider looking back in the slow time of
1:42. The outcome of the race was a sad
disappointment both to Vinctor's owner
and the public in general.
Three favor ites, a second choice and an
outsider scored winning brackets and tbe
betting fraternity left the track with quite
a bundle of celebration money. Caliente,
Fleur de Lis, Miss Pollard und Little Crip
ple were the other winners the books had
to pay off on. Phaeda, ridden by little
â¢â¢.iimrny" Woods, backed down from GO to
20 to 1, was sent out by ber people fur a
"killing"' in tbe last race, but had to be
content with second place.
Ten selling platers furnished a lively
betting affair for an opener, tbe distance
being six furlongs. Caliente, played down
from twos to 8 to s,wou rather easily at the
end from Rose Clark, a 30 to 1 shot sleeper
which finally tumbled out of bed. Among
those who also ran and should have shown
up better were Seaside and Sunrise 11.
Both will bear watching in future races.
After receding in the betting from evens
to 3 to 2, Fleur de Lis downed the other
four starters in the six furlong spin for
two-year-olds. Howard S, whose odas
were pountled down from 2J.^ to 1 to 7 to 5
favoritism, finished third. Hard tact 11
made the running to the stretch, when
l'iggott gradually moved Fleur de Lis into
the lead, and she won, ridden out, three
patts of a length before Hobenzollern.
Tbe black horse Bueno again dumped
the talent hard in the seven and Â» half
furlong run, with a field of nine starting.
Backed down from even money tÂ© 1 to 2,
he showed prominently for part of the
distance and then finished back in tn
ruck. Striking the stretch second to Kn
cino, who had been malting the running,
Miss Pollard, a daughter of imp. Idalium,
separated herself from the bunch and won
at the wire by half a length iroin Long
Lady, who came with a meteoric rush at
the close. Two Cheers, the second choice,
was third.
The concluding race was a mile and a
quarter selling event. Opening at '21,2 l , to
1, the ring was besieged with coin on Lit
tle Cripple, and the brown gelding clQsed
an even- money chance. The two out
siders, Castanette and Phaeda, led the
lield a merry chase to the stretch, where
the former had enough. The fir>t choice
gradually mowed down Phaeda's lead and
won easily In 2:09).Â£. Little Bob ended up
third, behind Phaeda.

CLEVELAND, Omo, Sept. 13. â In the
cane of the Alameda.s' protest against the
Tufts-Arms Company nine at Los Angeles,
Manager Burks of the Los Angeles team
has introduced three affidavits bearing a
notary's se,al to offset Alameda's claim.
Mr. and Mrs. A. Francfc, Darents of the
protested player, have sworn to affidavits
that their son was born November % 1878,
and is therefore but 17 years and 11 months
old. Second Baseman Tufts also swears
before the notary that he (Tufts) was re
sponsible for the clerical error on the
entry-list. He says that it was through
an error of the typewriter that the mis
take occurred.
TENNIS AT PACIFIC GROVE.
Harper and Janet Heaten by flnley and
Hamilton.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 18.â The
most exciting game of tennis ever wit
nessed at this place was played this after
noon on the city courts. Tne contestants
were Ed Finley and Dudley Hamilton
against James Harper and A. W. Jones
Jr. Both teams played in the Pacific
Coast tournament on the Btn and 9th and
did good work. There was great rivalry
between them. A large crowd was in at
tendance this afternoon. Harper and
Jones played a game after the style of the
Whitney brothers and did excellent work
all through the matcb, but this style
of playing being rather new to them they
lost. The score was: 6â2, Iâ6, 6âl,6 â 1, Bâ6.
Uoth teams will represent Monterey and
Pacific Grove la the Monterey County

STAR POINTER IS KING,
Paces the Three Fastest Con
secutive Mile Heats on
Record.
Goes a Half in :s<) 3-4, Establishing a
World's Figure lor That
Distance.
MKDFOKD. Mass.. Sept. 18.â An enor
mous crowd gathered at Mystic Park this
afternoon to witness thefree-lor-all pacing
contest in which Robert J, Frank Agan
and Star .Pointer were entered.
The race dedeveloped the three
fastest consecutive beats ever paced,
while in the first heat the New
England track record for a mile was
beaten and a world's pacing record for
half a mile was established by Star
j Pointer.
When the horses were sent off in the
first heat Star Pointer had the pole, with
, Robert J in second place and Frank Agan
on ttie outside. At the quarter, which
was made in :29%, Pointer was in the
lead, with the others at hia heels, and
when Star Pointer passed tbe half in
:oÃ9Â£, beating all exlsiting pacing records,
a tremendous shout went up from the
throats of thousands of spectator?. The
three-quarters was passed in I:3l'Â£, with
the positions of the racers unchanged.
Into the stretch they came at a record
breaking gait, all three working as steadily
as engines. Pointer shot under the wire a
winner by half a length in 2:G2J^, and
when the crowd realized tbe fast time that
had been made the excitement was tre
mendous.
In the second heat Star Pointer led from
the start to the end of the mile, and the
relative positions of the horses were un
changed throughout. Time, 2:O3J^.
The third beat was practically a repeti
tion of the second until within the last
thirty rods of the wire, when Robert J,
who bad been pushing Frank Agan bard
all the way for second place, pushed by
him and finished about a length behind
Pointer. Time, 2:03%.

CAPTAI N ANSON'S WRATH.
Says the Cleveland* Played the Chicagos
"a Tebau Trieli."
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept. 18.â Captain
Anson of the Chicago ball team yesterday
advanced a novel reason for the postpone*
ment of tbe game between Cleveland and
Chicago. Play was interrupted on account
of the wet grounds, and while the early
rain did not appear to be heavy enough to
render the grounds unfit for playin?, when
the hour for the game arrived it was dis
covered that League Park was the damp
est place in the neighborhood. Anson
was greatly disappointed and not dis
posed to take the disappointment good
naturedly.
-It is a Tebau trick," he said. "He has
used up bis pitchers on us and would have
to put in Young or Cuppy. He wants to

GRAND ORGAN
It Will Be the Finest Instru
ment of the Kind on
Earth.
IS NOW BEING RECEIVED
Mrs. Welsh, an Opulent Parish
ioner, Gave $50,000 for
â¢ Its Purchase.
FATHER VARSI'S MANT DESIGNS
Ninety Times Will the Earth Rotate
on Its Axis Ere the Organ
Can Be Used.
It will not be long till the parishioners
of St. Ignatius Church will rejoice and
their hearts will swell with pride, for
Polyhymnia has come to dwell among
them. Plainly speaking, the grandest
organ in the world as regards beauty of
finish, modern improvements and sweet
ness of tone is soon to be placed in the
church held sacred to the memory of St.
Ignatius.
The idea Is that of Mrs. Welsh, a rich
parishioner, who a year ago last June
presented the church with $50,000, the
balance remaining aftpr purchasing the
organ to go into a reserve fund to be used
in maintaining a choir. On the Ist of
last March the contfact was awarded to
Farrand & Votey of Detroit, Mich.
This was the firm tbnt built the mam
moth organ for tbe World's Fair and
recently the celebrated organ for the
Carnegie library.
While not the largest in existence the
organ will probably be the finest in the
world in the way of musical resources and
mechanical accessories. There will be'
four manuals of aixty-one notes each ana
a pedal of thirty notes. There will also be
eighty-six speaking-stops, including the
preparations for au altar organ.
The number of pipes in the organ are
something stupendous, aggregating over
5000. It will De placed in the lower gal
lery of the church, and will tower upward
for 37 feet 6 inches. It is 83 feet in width
and 18 feet in depth.
The entire organ is electro-pneumatic
The keyboard, or console, will be placed
some distance in front of the organ-case.
Within mis console will be placed the
electro-contact pneumatic piston knobs
for moving the various adjustable combi
nations.
The case of the instrument is of selected
white ash, linished in the natural color,
and the front pipes are ornamented in
gold and colors. The case has a beautiful
finish and is of most imposing design,
beautifully carved, with two life-sized
angels placed on the top columns.
The wind supply will be furnished with
six sets of bellows, operated by two elec
tric motors of 7 horsepower, one of 5 and
the other of 2. This bellows plant will be
situated in the lower room, at the left of
the orcan, and the air will be conveyed
about lorty feet to the receivers within the
ortran.
The first carload arrived about ten days
ago. The entire organ wiil occupy about
five cars. Two of these have been un
loaded, one is in the warehouse and two
are en route. An idea of the size of the
grand instrument when set up may be
gathered from its weight â over 100,000
pounds.
Fully three months will be required to
put the organ into working order. Taking
the improvements in the way of pipes and
facilities lor handling into consideration,
it wili undoubtedly be the finest instru
ment of its kind in the world.
The erection of the organ is under the
supervision of W. I>- Woods, assistant
superintendent of the factory. He will be
assisted in this by Foreman A. Â£. White
head, also of Detroit.
In building the organ the manufac
turers were greatly aided by the advice
and suggestions of Father Varsi. The de
sign for the decoration of the front pip. >s
was furnished Dy him alone.
'â¢This will be the first electric organ in
San Francisco," said Superintendent
Woods. "I believe, however, that it is
only the second in California, as there is
one also in Los Angeles.
"The intention was to place it in the
upper gallery, but it was found to be better
to place it in the lowtr gallery. So pro
vision has been made for lemoving a part
of the upper gallery, all but two small
balconies.
"This will not only improve the ap
pearauce of the organ itself, but wil! assist
in the attainment of musical results and
be far better for the choir."
FOR SOUND MONEY.
This Is Not the Time for Trying
Hazardous Experiments.
Brainard N. Rowley, publisher of the
Calitornia Fruit Grower, was asked by a
Call reporter yesterday for his opinion on
the financial issue now before the people.
In reply, he said:
"You ask me if lam a gold or a silver
man. I will tell you briefly what I think
of the gold and silver question. ' I am a
conservative sound-money man. The
country needs more money per capita, but
we are in no condition for trying hazard
ous experiments. The signs of the times
are such as to warrant tbe statement that
the people of these United Slates are not
in the mood to be trifled with, or, if you
please, in a position t<- chancu their very
existence on theories or problematical
statements with relereuce to our monetary
system. If the opening of our mints to
tne Ires coinage of silver will have the
effect of enhancing the world's ?<rice
(mind you, I say th* world's price) of
shyer bullion from its present low value of
05 cents an ounce to say $129 an ounce,
thf n 1 am in favor of t:ie tree coinage of
silver, and would say let it pass current
fur all debts, both public and private,
except upon written contracts to the
contrary.
"On the other hand, if the silver coins
thai would be turned out by our mints are
tÂ«> paBB lor their face value in this country
only upon the basis of the Government
stamp being upon their face and not upon
the value oi the material wh'Ch they con
tain, then I am opposed to the iree-coin
age proposition as presented at this time.
Our troub.ei are great enough at present
without the addition of tiat or medal
money in unlimited quantities. While
we need an increased circulating medium
with which to transact business, we should
have a mediumAuat will pass current in
any part of the world at its face value
owing to its intrinsic worth."

Cayucos, San Luis Obispo, was in
town yesterday. He gives a flattering re
port of Republican loyalty in that part of
the county and says that there can be no
doubt that San Luis Obispo will roll up a
big majority lor McKinley.
Senator Beard ot Alameda came over
yesterday and reported that the majority
for Republicanism in that county would
be larger than ever voted before.

BISHOPS TO MEET HERE.
Some Episcopal Leaders oi
Western States Coming
to Confer.
A Week's Discussion of Plans for
Improving the Divinity School
at San Mateo.
An informal conference of Episcopal
Bishops of several of the Western States
will be held in this City about the end of
this month, beginnidg with a date not yet
fixed and continuing for one week.
The purpose of the meeting is primarily
the discussion of .matters pertaining to the
Church Divinity School at San Mateo.
Other matters may be taken up, but so far
no programme has been decided upon.
Those who will come to this conference
are the Bishop of Utah, Nevada and
Western Colorado; the Bishop of New
Mexico and Arizona, the Bishop of Oiym
pia (Washington), the Bishop of Los An
geles (Southern California), and the
Bishop of California, the Rev. Dr. Nichols.
The meetings will probably be held in
Grace Church, convenient to the local
Diocesan House and the sanctum of the
Pacific Churchman, the* Episcopal ortran.
While nothing has been outlined . with
regard to the character of the informa
discmsions, it is understood this confer
ence is expected to provide for increased
efficiency in the character and scope of the
work of the divinity school.
In line with this movement, without be
ing a feature of it, will be a series of so
called missions or evangelistic discourses,
soon to be given during a period of several
months by Mr. Webber of the Milwaukee
diocese, who will visit a large number of
the parishes in this diocese.
Mention of this contemplated scries ot
educational addresses was made yesterday
forenoon by Bishop Nichols at a meeting
of the clergy held in Grace Church. The
occasion was the Ember-tide gathering of
the Episcopal clergy of San Francisco and
vicinity. The service of the holy com
munion was celebrated by the Bishop,
who was assisted by the liev. Dr. J?'oute
Afterward Bishop Nichols delivered the
address ad c.erum, during which he
spoke of the immediate concerns of the
clergy in California; the question of the
supply of candidates for holy orders, the
matter of sacred studies â all of which
went to show in a way something of the
nature of the quest. to be discussed at
the coming conference of Bishops.

LINCOLN AND LAUGHTER.
in Amusing Entertainment at the Asso-
elation Auditorium.
A clever entertainment was given last
night at the Association Auditorium by
Franfc .Lincoln, the humorist and mimic.
The audience laughed almost continu
ously at the whimsical impersonations
and character hits. Sometimes the mirth
became so irrepressible that Mr. Lincoln
had to pause awhile till it had subsided.
Most of the features in the entertain
ment consisted of imitations of different
characters and types of humanity. The
entertainer used no makeup, trusting to
bis voice and facial expression to get his
effects, though his talent for ventriloquism
helped bin. in his impersonations.
One amusing character sketch wan an
imitation of a virtuoso at the piano, with
all the mannerisms and mane-tossings
affected by some long-haired pianists.
Another sketch that roused roars of laugh
ter was a redhot addrees by an anarchist,
Lincoln made the address in German, and
after the applause had subsided congratu
lated the audience on their knowledge of
the language. "I don't know a word of
German myself," he said ; "it is all by ear
that I repeat that address."
An address on the evils of poker playing
proved another good means for arousing
laughter. The impersonation oi an old
lady with loose teeth 7:as also clever. Al
together the entertainment was a very
enjoyable one and well deserved the ap
plause it received.
HEAD OF THE ORDER.
Panlist Father AugiiÃtin F. Hewit Is
Recovering ilia Health.
The Pauhst Fathers at old St. Mary's
Cathedral have received from New York
the consoling news that Superior-General
Augustin F. Hewit, the head of the order,
is improving in health.
Father Hewit, who was ordained in 1847,
has been at death's door for several weeks
and only a few days ago it was wired here
that there was no hope of his :ecovery.
Why It Is a Leader.
The reason why Towu Talk stands at the
head oi the list in local weekly journalism is
easily explained. It is fearless In editorial
criticism, its fiction is of the best In the
literary market; in fuct, the entire contents of
Town Talk are such that they more than fulfill
the expectations of the reading public. This
week's vissue Is especially artistic, the front
page being embellished with a beautiiul half
tone of Mrs. W. E. Dargie and the eociety de
pnrtment with a. portrait of Mrs. Walter Scott
Hobart. Other illustrations, lively political
chat, strong ; editorials and crisp dramatic mid
musical reviews complete, with much miscel
laneous matter, a delightiui number. â¢
The Brief* Now on File.
All the briefs in the Dick Williams case
were filed yesterday. It is understood that
Judge Morrow is writing an elaborate opinion
on tbe motion for s new trial, and that the
same will be rendered on Tuesday next.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
YOUNG CITIZENS
FOR McKINLEY
The Auditorium Is Filled
With an Applaud
ing Throng.
LOGIC AND ELOQUENCE.
Able Address by J. M. Oliver
of the University of
California.
OVATION TO D. E. M'KIRLAY.
J M. Sweetser of Stanford Scores the
Democratic Party and Its
Candidate.
Young blood Is evidently a strong factor
in local Republicanism. Last night's
rally of Republican young men, held at
the Auditorium under the auspices oi the
McKinley Invincibles, was a convincing
argument in support of their numerical
force. Bonfires blazed and rockets as
cended, while tuneful bands and cheering
crowds unable to gain an entrance con
firmed the verdict of the throng within
the building.
The affair opened with a medley of
patriotic airs, given by Yanke's orchestra,
followed by a masterly rendering of the
overture to Rossini's opera of "Semi
ramide."
Messrs. D. M. Lawrence, C. M. Elliott,
D. B. Crane and L. A. Larsen, who com
prise the 'Knickerbocker quartet, sane
"Protection Is Bound to Win the Day,"
and as an encore a comic song, com
mencing "The Owl and the Pussy Cat
Went Out to Sea," which was cordially
applauded.
William S. Barnes, president of the
evening, in a graceful address of welcome,
said his auditors might have heard him
speak before and would probably not care
to hear him again.
Cries of dissent greeted this assumption,
but Mr. Barnes was obdurate and would
not give a speech. Instead he introduced
J. M. Oliver of the University of Cali
fornia, who made a masterly address.
"Bryan has gone about the country
looking for people to hear him," said Mr.
Oliver, "while thousands of thinking men
have flocked to hear McKinley speak in
answer to thoir urgent reqnests. Bryan
has enacted the part of the traveling show
man; McKinley seems to be regarded by
the American people as a pure-flowing
fount of political wisdom.
"Twelve years ago the Democratic party
raised a bowl that there was a surplus in
the National treasury and that the Re
publican party was to blame for it being
kept there. This howl resulted in the
ejection of Grover Cleveland and in the
rapid disappearance of the surplus, leav
ing the Nation impoverished and behind
hand.
"But some will say : 'The severe lessons
of the past have taught the Democracy a
few of the things it did not know some
years ago.' Don't be deceived. They sing
long and loud of patriotism, but the bray
of the ass can never be mistaken for the
roar of the lion, though the ass bray never
so loud. Democracy has bidden farewell
to its old-time prestige. Consistency, we
are told, is a jewel, but Democratic con
sistency has been sold for cheap silver."
Miss Amy C. Hickox of Oakland was
introduced by Mr. Barnes as "a typical
American bimetallist who will charm us
by silvery notes from a golden throat."
She sang the "Star-spangled Banner" as
the stirring song has seldom before been
rendered in this City, being rapturously
applauded after each strophe. In answer
to an enthusiastic recall Miss Hickox gave
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean."
D. E. McKinlay was then introduced
and was obliged to wait long beiore the
applause which greeted him would sub
side.
"I believe," he said, "one needs not be
a prophet in order to foretell a "reat vic
tory lor the Republican party. We are no
longer swayed by sentiment in our
politics. National questions latterly seem
to resolve themselves into simple business
propositions.
'â¢The Republican party demands a re
turn to the protective regime, under which
our Nation was enabled to attain a degree
of prosperity unparalleled in the world's
history. The same party demands as well
a reliable monetary system. Republican
ism looks toward the establishment of a
universal bimetallic standard, which shall
be recognized throughout the money
usine world.
"We see that the silver dollar, though
realiy worth now only about 51 centsâ
since the price of silver has fallen 4 cents
an ounce during the past two weeks â
counts for as much as a gold dollar in the
payment of debts and the purchase of
commodities. This is because of the good
American cold which stands behind it.
"But let the market be flooded with
cheap money and the more valuable
money will little by little be retired from
general circulation and held at a premium.
This would practically result in a divided
standard, consisting of appreciated gold
and vastly depreciated silver."
Mr. MclCinlay then entered into an ex
haustive review of the money question,
exposing some fallacious arguments in
favor of free silver with a merciless satire,
which convulsed the audience with laugh
ter. The prosperity of Mexico, he con
tended, could not beatributed to the free
silver coinage system of the republic, but
rather to its high protective tariff laws,
which oblige all but the very rich to use
articles of home manufacture and produc
tion.
"Sometimes it seems to me," concluded
Mr. McKinlav, "it would be a good thing
to pen up five or six of our States and put
all our free trade and free silver people
there and let them take thÂ«> medicine
they offer us until it should sicken them.
But wÂ« cannot do this; we must alt suffer
or prosj.er together. Hence we need to
work together for the furtherance of our
â¢ common good. This end can be encom
passed only by the protection of our in
dustries and the integrity of our money."
J. M. Sweetser of Stanford University
was the next speaker.
"We can never have too much of Mc-
Kinley," he commenced, "whetner he t>e
of Ohio or California. Never before in the
history of the country have American
universities been so united upon political
issues. Speaking for Stanford I can safely
say a very large majority of its students
are in favor of ri ht and honest politics,
and their professors for the most part are
with them.
"Pernaps to-morrow's Democratic pa
pers may make fun of our young Repub
lican speakers who have tried to hold
your attention to-night. Perhaps they
may call us would-bfe boy orators. We
cannot complain if they do. But we have
one point in our favor â we are conscions
of our shortcomings and we are not pos
ing, boy orators though we be, as candi
dates lor the Presidency of these United
States."
The home-thrust was greeted with a
burst of cheering which made speaker and
audience thoroughly at home with each
other, and Mr. Sw'eetser favored the as
semblage with a brilliant and lucid pre
sentation of Republican argument in a
i fresh, new guise which called forth fre
quent manifestations of cordial approval.
The Knickerbockers then gave one of
their new songs, "Good-by, Free Silver,
Good-by," the refrain to which runs as
follows:
Bye, Bryan, bye low,
What makes you sigh go?
Bye, Bryan, bye low,
Good-by, Bill Bryan. Good-by.
This choruc, repeated in the faintest,
mock-pathetic pianissimo, called forth a
burst of applause, and the assemblage dis
persed with three cheers for McKinley,
ACTIVE REPUBLICANS.
Speeches and Resolutions In the
Thirty-Fifth District.
The following preamble and resolution
were Introduced at the meeting of the Thir
ty-fifth Assembly District Republican
Club last evening by C. L. Hedemark and
unanimously adopted:

OPPOSED TO PERKINS.
Alameda County Politicians Who
Share the Views Expressed by
Ex-Mayor Chapman.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 18.â The chief
topic being discussed to-night is the effect
that to-morrow's primary will have on the
proposed indorsement of a United States
Senator in Monday's convention. It is
very evident that ex-Mayor Chapman's
remarks regarding Senator Perkins repre
sent the ideas of many leading politicians,
and being backed as they are by Senator
Denison they cannot fail to produce some
resuit. Although the political headquar
ters are filled to-night with active workers
very few will give a definite opinion on
the subject, about which there is more
thinking than talking. According to the
call of the County Committee there may be
no indorsement at all oy legislative candi
dates, even although the convention
should adopt the platform.
The call provides for the county con
vention and also for the district conven
tions, and it is held that unless the nomi
nations at district conventions are ratified
by the whole county convention no pledge
can be demanded. As the call does not
provide that the district nominations
shall go before the whole convention the
legislative nominees would not be pledged,
although a platform with a pledge might
be adopted.
it is no secret that every man who
worked and voted for Judge Frick at the
last primary is opposed to Perkins because
of the Senator's alleged violation of faith
in indorsing Hilborn. As Frick polled
within 1000 votes of Hilborn out of about
14,000. it is seen at a glance that the county
is well divided.
\\ . H. Church, a hold-over Supervisor,
said to-night that nothing wouid be* left
undone to prevent the indorsement of
Perkins. "We shall work hard to carry
the Fourth and Sixlh wards," he said,
"and this will give us thirty-one dele
gates, and if we have no more it will be
sullicient to make a big protest against
indorsement."
Chairman Mantalen of the County Cen
tral Committee says that he thinks the
unpledged ticket will win in the Sixth
Ward. "We have got no real fight in
view," he said, "except to see that we
elect an unpledged Assemblyman from
the Forty-eighth District."
M. C. Chapman, who was the first to de
nounce Perkins, says he has sufficiently
explained his position, and merely added,
"I see I am not alone."
If the ticket in the interest of Phil
Walsh for Supervisor wins in the First
Ward, and. he claims that it will, it will go
into the convention unpledged.
Until the closÂ« of the primaries the
strength of the opposition to Perkins can
not be intelligently estimated, as in every
district the local fight has precedence.
POLITICS ARE MIXED.
There Are Three Tickets In Ala
meda Naming Three Sets of Pro
posed Republican Delegates.
ALAMEDA. Cal,, Sept. 18.â There are
three tickets of delegates in the field to
night and prospects of more to-morrow.
The first ticket was that of the Alameda
Republican Club, and is known as the
regular Republican ticket It is for Sena
tor Perkins and supposedly for C. E.
Naylor for the AÂ«sembiy. Several of
those named have repudiated this.
The friends of Judge A. B. Hunt have a
ticket in the field which will support J. A.
Waymire for the Assembly. The gentle
men named are: Georce W. Scott, C. L.
Metzger. John G. Brick, J. S. Hanley, E.
A. yon Schmidt, H. A. Thompson, Samuel
Frank, R. J. Tyson, John Larkin, Frank
E. Browning, W. F. Sperbeck, C. F. Flet
ter, George H. Payne, George S. Ames,
Max Gundlach, Henry Muller, E. L. Hut
ton, Charles W. Petry, L. H. Transue, J.
Clement Bates Jr., Joseph R. Knowland
Frank A. Webb, J. H. de Nise, J. JL. Bal
lennne, I. H. Chandler, A. R. Denke, C.
H. Lindeman, A. G. Burns, A. D. Cush
ing, Ward Battles, J. H. Bruns, C. C. Vol
ben?, J. W. Jackson, P. Kiernan.
To-day a new ticket was sprung bearing
the heading "Independent Unpledged Re
publican Ticket." Those whose names
appear upon this are: Herman. Cordes,
George B. Manley, E. A. yon Schmidt,
Joseph R. Knowland Jr., James W. Trav
ers, Ed Houston. J. A. Remrael, Alex
Hay. L. H. Transue, William Higby,

ning, I. N. Chapman, Edwin Bell, G C
Bro ke. B. E. Combs, E. J. Blandmg j'
R. Sloan, G. A. Bordwell, Thomas
White.
Late to-nieht it was discovered that the
tickets of the regular Republican club did
not conform to the requirements of the
County Central Committee call and a new
set was issued. This will cause confusion,
as the tickets had all been distributed. If
the ones first issued were used the officers
of election could throw them out.
San 3lateo's Contest.
The Supreme Court yesterday put an end to
thn Supervisorial contest between J. J. Brown
and J. T. Jennings of San Mateo County. Jen
nings claimed he had been counted out by
Brown's friends, cut the court, after consider
ing the Testimony, found tbat he hud received
only 129 votes to Brown's 153, and the appeal
was dismissed.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
CHANGES IN THE
FERRY BUILDING
Tennessee Marble Will Be
Used on the Main
Front.
NO COMPRESSED BRICK.
Reinsurance Paid on the French
Ship Jules Verne From
Newcastle.
SHE IS CONSIDERABLY OVERDUE
No News Has Been Received From
the Missing Tramp Steamer
Liolitbgow.
Changes in the ferry depot plans are
again in order. A special meeting of the
Harbor Commissioners was held yester
day, and Chief Engineer Holmes advo
cated a change from the use of polisned
compressed brick to that of Tennessee mar-
Die with which to finish the front. The
alteration will entail an extra expenditure
of money, but other changes will make a
sufficient saving to offset the difference.
Instead of extendine the wings of the de
pot Mr. Holmes is for cutting them down
somewhat, and not finishing them in the
elaborate manner designed. They can be
made plain yet handsome, and the money
saved will pay for the Tennessee marble.
The members of the commission are in
favor of the change, and the ciiances are
that the order will be issued next Tuesday
to the builders.
The Risdon Iron Works is pushing the
building of the frame, and Commissioner
Cole expects that with the present rate of
progress a considerable portion of the
building will be finished in eight months.
The late steamer Eastern Oregon is still
in the hands of the men who are altering
her into a schooner. When ready for rig
ging it was found that a keel would have
to be put on her. She was towed to Oak
land Creek yesterday, where the necessary
change will be made. Her twin engines
are now being placed in two steam schoon
ers, and they will probably go into com
mission the latter part of this month.
The crew of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's Orizaba are very indignant
over the manner in which some of their
number are being treated in Mexico. They
were arrested on ttie suspicion of being
smugglers and thrown into jail at Guay
mas. They appealed to the American
Consul for relief, but he raid no attention
to them. Their case could not be brought
to trial, as the Judge was in the interior.
J. Raymond, the steamer's cook, and two
waiters and two mess boys were arrested.
They had considerable cloth and presents
for friends among their effects, and that
was what cut them into trouble. "The men
were treated in an outrageous manner,"
said one of the Orizaba's crew yesterday.
"They were simply locked up in an mclo
snre, and as the thermometer registered
110 in the shade you can imagine how
they suffered. Then they had no covering
at night and the dew always drenched
them. They are all citizens, but the
American Consul laughed at them. They
have now been six weeks in prison, and
1 would not be a bit surprised to hear
that some of them have died."
The French bark Jules Verne is now out
ninety-six days from Newcastle, Austra
lia, for this port, and 10 per cent rein
surance ie being paid on her. The Verne
left Havre to load coal for San Francisco,
but owing to the strike of miners at New
castle she was unable to get a load. She
accordingly sailed in ballast, being under
charter to load wheat at Port Costa for
Europe. She has not since been heard
from. The Louis Pasteur, which sailed
one day ahead of the Verne, arrived in
port two weeks ago, but saw no sign of
the missing ship. Roth, Blum & Co., the
agents, do not think the vessel has been
lost. They say she is a slow sailor, and
that as all the late arrivals have reported
light winds and calms no anxiety should
be felt for the missing vessel.
The tramp steamer Linhthgow, which
sailed from here for Leith some time ago,
has been reinsured at 10 guineas per cent.
She broke down off the coast 01 Central
America, and a boat's crew was sent
ashore to report the matter. The steamer
has not since been heard from.
F. F. McEwen, who was accused of steal
ing a quantity of clothing from the Brit
ish fhip Ravenscourt, gave himself up
yesterday at the Harbor Police station.
The vessel is now on her way to Liver
pool, so there will be no one to prosecute
the case, and McEwen may get orf.
The captain of the river steamer Gold
reported yesterday that he passed the
body of a man off Alcatraz. A boat was
sent out to look for the remains, but no
trace of them could be lonnd.
TO SAVE WORDEN.
A Petition Will Be Sent to the Governor
Asking for Clemency.
Since tbe arrival from Japan of Rev. W.
S. Worden, the missionary and brother of
the condemned man at Folsom, renewed
exertions are being made to have Gov
ernor Budd commute the sentence of the
convicted man who is now awaiting the
appeal to the Supreme Court for a rehear
ing of bis case. In the meantime, the
Rev. Mr. Worden hus communicated with
Attorney Burk of Woodland to prepare a
petition to the Governor. This will be
taken hold of by the San Francisco Labor
Council and circulated for signatures, and
when complete will be laid beiore Gov
ernor Budd, who, they think, will give
due consideration to the number of signa
tures attached thereto.
Japanese Socialist*.
According to Theodore Ly^ich, secretary
of the propaganda committee of Liberty
Branch of the Socialist Labor party, the
ranks of that party will shortly be aug
mented by a considerable number of Japa
nese students of political economy who
have been investigating the econoftic
views of the socialists for several months
past. They are now desirous of aflilialing
with that party to finish their training
and perfect themselves in the methods
and aims of the American socialists for
future socialistic propaganda work among
their wa^e-working friends and compa
triots in the land ot the Rising Sun.
To Swim the Gate.
Great interest is being manifested in the
forthcoming daring feat of Swimmer Cavill,
who to-morrow will attempt to swim the
Golden Gate from Fort Point to Lime Point.
Colonel W. H. Mendell, the popular excursion
agent, will manage tbe trips to be made by
two great steamers that will accompany the
swimmer. Ticke;s will be 50 cents each lor
adults and 25 cents for children under 12
years of age.
Wants to Be a Trader.
Dr. Catherine V. C. Scott has applied to the
Superior Court for permission to become a sole
trader, alleging that her husband, Joseph E.
Scott, does not derive a sufficient income as a
minister of the gospel to support her.

KLKCTION NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
Don't forget the Republican primaries
to-day.
Hear Irving M. Scott at the Auditorium
this evening.
Don't forget to leave orders to-day for
The Sunday Call.
They may call it a fusion of parties, but
it means nothing but a dicker between
office-seekers.
It is not yet certain whether Senator
Hill is crawling out of his hole or crawl
ing further in.
It is the soldier candidate and not the
orator candidate whose speeches are most
pleasing to the people.
If there is any man of National repute
who is supporting Bryan it is time for him
to get up and show himself.
The people have trusted Democracy
once and as a consequence many of them
have had to live on trust ever since.
Democrats and Populists seem to have
abandoned the idea of a campaign of edu
cation and have gone into trade for votes.
The San Francisco Democrat is in a bad
box, for when he tries to get out of the
wet he has to get in with the Rainey
crowd.
California must have an iron industry
adequate to her neads, and in order to
have it she must protect it by favorable
legislation.
McKinley Is makine gooa business for
Canton and wben he gets Loto the White
House he will make business good for the
whole country.
Oator is rapidly becoming an issue
between the Democrats and tne Pgpulists,
and he is trying to make himself as big a
one as possible.
Protection is becoming more and more
the chief issue of the campaign and the
Democrats are dodging it by getting out
of the campaign.
The RepuDlican primaries are open to
day from 12 m. to 7P. M. Every loyal Re
publican is entitled to one vote and should
be sure to cast it.
"We want in this country good work,
good wages and good money," says Major
McKinley, and on that platform all the
people are with him.
It is altogether vain and foolish for
England to expect us to help her settle
with Turkey when we haven't yet finished
in helping her to settle with Venezuela.
Politics begins with the primaries and
every Republican should attend the elec
tion in his district to-day in order to have
himself represented in the municipal con
vention.
No scheme of political fusion has ever
yet succeeded with the American people,
and it never will &3 iong as the people
â¢have respect for political principles and a
disgust for trading office-seekers.
The Democrats who have given Cator
the pleasing hope that he is the loeical
candidate of the fusionists for the United
States senatorship may be fooling some
body, but whom are they fooling?
You get the United Press dispatches in
The Call, but in no other morning paper
in this City; so if you wish to have all the
news of all parties given impartially and
accurately you must read Thb Call every
day.
The New York Democrats who declared
for the gold standard in June have deÂ»
clttred now for the silver standard, so we
can see how much easier it is for the tiger
to change his stripes than for the leopard
to change his spots.
Â»
The man who sold the lion's skin while
the lion was yet alive was killed in hunt
ing him, and Democrats and Populists
who are trading to one another the offices
of the people while the people are wide
awake may find a profit in studying the
fate of the skin-seiler.
Let all loyal Republicans attend the
primaries this afternoon and elect a thor
oughly representative municipal conven
tion and the result will be a ticket that
will have the support of every good citi
zen and assure the City an effective and
economical business administration.
The address of Irving M. Scott to the
ironmolders this evening will differ from
the ordinary campaign speech, inasmuch
as it will be the discourse of a practical
man on a subject of which he is an ac
knowledged master, addressed to men
who are interested in it as the industry of
their lives. It will, therefore, be a true
educational sneech ami will deserve the
attentive study of all citizens.
THE IRON INDUSTRY.
At the Auditorium this evening Irving
M. Scott will address the ironworkers of
the State on the relation of the political
issues of the day to their industry. In
many respects this will be one of the most
notable addresses of the campaign. No
industry is more important to a com
munity than that of ironworking, and the
civilization of a people may be well esti
mated by the extent to which that indus
try is carried on among them.
It is an old story that Solomon pro
nounced the blacksmith to be the chief
of artisans because he made the tools by
which ail other artisans did their work.
The establishment of an adequate iron in
dustry is the first essential of an enlight
ened and independent community. Cali
fornia must be able to manufacture all the
ironwork needed in her trades and indus
tries if she would be free from depend
ence on other lands, and whatsoever tends
to promote that industry is a matter of
concern to every Caiifornian.
No man is better ntted to deal with this
important theme than Irving M. Scott.
He is one of the greatest ironworkers in
the world. He aid his partners of the
Union Iron Wdrks have built up in Cali
fornia a ship-building yard whose accom
plishments are amone the highest tri
umphs of the constructive engineering of
the ace. The Oregon, the Olympia, the
San Francisco, the Charleston and the
Monterey hold each a place in the front
rank of their class of ships, and attest to
the Nation and to the world what can be
done by the ironworkers of California
under the direction of a skillful, energetic
and vigorous manager.
That the iron industry of California is
carried on under adverse conditions is
known to everybody. Very few, however,
are aware how adverse those conditions
are, or to what extent they oan be im
proved by favorable legislation. All the
issues to be submitted to the people in
this election are economic, and all of them
of course will affect our iron industry to a
marked degree. It is a matter of vital
importance, therefore, that they should
be decided right at the polls. There is no
conflict of rich and poor, or of labor and
capital, involved in the issue. All Cali
fornians are interested in the upbuilding
of this industry of the State, but most
especially so are the ironworkers thera
selves, for their very livelibood depends
upon it. Every ironworker of the City
should attend Mr. Scott's address to-night,
and every ironworker of the State should
read it. in order that they may know ex
actly how far their business, their wages
and their welfare depend upon their poli
tics and their votes.
Addresses of this kind have a value
above ordinary campaign speeches. They
are truly educational in their nature. If
other large manufacturers followed the ex
ample set by the practical patriotism of
Mr. Scott and used tbeir knowledge to
teach the people our politics would have a
much higher tone. There would be a
clearer understanding of public interests
and a better comprehension of the rela
tion of those interests to National patriot
ism.
There is scarcely any point in the economy
of National affairs of greater moment than
â¢ the uniform preservation of the intrinsic
\ value of the money unit. On this the security
and steady value of property essentially de
pend. â Alexander Hamilton.
WHY THEY GO TO CANTON.
More than fifty special trains carried
delegations to Canton yesterday. It was
not, strictly speaking, a partisan demon
stration, for thousands of Democrats par
ticipated, but every one of the thousands
will vote for Major McKiniey. It is some
thing new in an American political cam
paign for voters to charter railway trains
and travel hundieds of miles to pay their
respects to the candidate of their choice,
but there are delegations from distant
parts of the country every day at Canton,
and seemingly the beginning of the move
ment has not yet been reached.
If only Republicans were journeying to
Major McKinley's home there might be
some reason to suppose that it was a
political trlcn to draw attention and create
enthusiasm, but it so happens that a great
many who never voted a Republican ticket
are in these great crowds of pilgrims, and,
what is more, those who go charter trains
on their own account and pay the bill
themselves. It will be conceded, there
fore,* that something other than party
politics is causing this daily rush of people
to Canton, and it is true that the incentive
is something far removed from ordinary
campaign enthusiasm.
The fact is, industries everywhere are
closing down and commercial and mer
cantile enterprises are curtailing opera
tions as much as possible because the
threats of the Bryanites to force destruc
tive methods upon the world of trade and
traffic if Bryan is elected are destroying
confidence in business circles. That is
why Republicans and Democrats are
working together to avoid such a calamity
as Bryan's election woula be. All of
Major McKinley's economic theoriej are
not indorsed by Democrats, but they
know that if he is elected be will make
no wild and ill-advised chanzes in the
existing monetary system of the country.
And aeain, business men and working
men do not quit their places of occupa
tion and journey miles away merely to
feed their curiosity; and so it must be
that they travel all the way to Canton to
give Ai a jor McKinley encouragement from
a sense of duty, which all the more em
phasizes the feeiinc of fear that now pre
vails in business circles over the possi
bility of Bryan's election. To be sure,
there is little if any likelihood of Bryan's
election, but commerce and industries are
not disposed to take any chances, and that
is why business men and wage-earners,
without reference to part ties, are giving
all the aid they can in making Major Mc-
Kinley's election sure beyond the pos
sibility of a doubt.
Ido not believe that you can legislate up
the value of anything any more than I be
lieve you can viake generals heroes by legisla
tion. The Continental Congress tried legis
lating values up by resort to penalties, but
the inexorable laws of trade, as independent
as the laws of gravitation, kept them down. â
Roscoe Conkling.
THE GRAND JUKY'S REPORT.
The revelations of the Grand Jury are
simply an official report of things and
doings which the public has been familiar
with for a long time. Nevertheless the
recommendations of the Grand Jury
should oe considered in the light of
the authority making them and remedies
should be applied that will correct the evils
complainedjof. What the people want is a
capable and economical administration of
their municipal affairs, and to secure that
they may be relied upon to hold up the
hands, of the Grand Jury or any other le
gally constituted authority in tne work of
giving protection to the social and busi
ness interests of the community against
whatever is running counter to the law
and the best good of the municipality.
The presumption is that the Graad Jury
bases its report upon facts that can be sub
THIS SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
stantiated by those whose duty it is to
protect the people from unjust acts and
extravagant expenditure of the public
money. If enormous assessments have
been made, or if favoritism has been shown
in the conduct of any of tne City's offi
cials, it certainly is the duty of some one
or other public official to undertake to
complete the work begun by the Grand
Jury. It is a matter of enforcing the law
and not a matter of any official's likes and
dislikes.
As we have said, the people want and
will have a municipal government that
governs for the best interests of all the
citizens, and public sentiment will stand
by the officers of the law in every effort to
punish wrongdoing, whether it be in high
or low places. The Grand Jury says glar
ing abuses have been allowed to creep into
the management of many of the City's
departments, and if that be true it would
not be difficult to locate those who are re
sponsible for it. The public is satisfied
that in some instances at least the jury's
charges are easy to substantiate, and it
demands that reforms be adopted that
shall oblige officials to serve the public as
their oath of office requires them. The
report of the Grand Jury is before the
public, and public sentiment can oblige
the proper action to be taken upon it.
My own idea is that we should encourage
home manufactures to the extent of our own
consumption. I have said that the home mar
ket is the best market. You know that from
experience; ami the home market is made bel
ter by increasing our factories and giving
employ men*, to idle workmen. Put every idle
man in the country to work and your consum
ers will be increased, and when your consum
ers are increased then the market is improved
and the better the price you receive for your
products. â McKinley.
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
The centennial anniversary of George
Washington's farewell address to his
countrymen will be pretty generally cele
brated throughout the United States to
day, as it should be, for what we now
enjoy in the way of personal liberty is
a heritage that cost the founders of the
Government a great deal, and we should
remember with especial gratitude the man
who made the Declaration of Independ
ence effective by leading the armies of
freedom to sure and certain victory.
There have been many changes in the
methods and conduct of the political and
commercial affairs of the people in the
century now closing, but the central idea
of the purpose of the Government, as ex
pressed by George Washington, "The very
idea of the power and the right of a peo
ple to establish government, presupposes
the duty of every individual to obey the
established government," has never grown
dim nor lost any of its power to awaken
to duty. George Washington issued his
address to about 5,000.000 people, and to
day more than 70,000,000 people participate
in the blessings of his achievement.
It is proper, therefore, that the people
give puolic demonstration of their grati
tude to the founder of a system ot govern
ment that secures the highest opportunity
for individual endeavor and encourage
ment to go from strength to strength in
all the ways that lead to peace, happiness
and the full enjoyment of one's own
honest efforts. George Washington was
needed by humanity, and he came in the
fullness of time to strengthen civilization
in its onward and upward march.
I can take the dollars of my country into
every free-silver coinage nation of the world â
Mexico, China, Japan, South America â
wherever you please, and I can buy twice as
much at the home store as Die most privileged
citizen of the locality can buy with the best
dollar his Government gives him to use. Ido
not care to exchange my privilege with any
man who is ready to give me two of his dol
lars to one of viine.â Senator Thurston.

THE TRUTH VS. BRYAN.
In his speech at Charlotte, N. C, Mr.
Bryan boldly asserted that "we have been
decreasing our circulation for the last few
years," and then he went on to claim
that, owing to the demonetization of silver
in 1873, the volume of the country's circu
lating money medium baa failed to keep
pace with the increase in the volume of
trade and commerce, and that as a conse
quence our dollars nave been enhanced in
value.
If Mr. Bryan would take the trouble to
inform himself upon the questions he dis
cusses he would have & better standing as
a teacher of the science of government
and practical economics. It so happens
that a notification of nominav'on does not
convey to the nominated any knowledge
or understanding of the principles of the
party, nor wigdom that he may properly
apply them if elected, but Mr. Bryan is
under the impression it would seem that
the convention which nominated him also
endowed him with a perfect knowledge
of all there is of political and commercial
economy. At least he is laboring under
that or some other hallucination, for no
man who was at himself would stand be
fore an audience and contradict facts of
current history of which every one was
cognizant.
If Mr. Bryan will secure a statement
from the Treasury Department concern
ing the per capita money in the United
States eince the Government was founded
and will study the exhibit after he has re
ceived it, he will know a good deal more
than he did when he asserted at Charlotte
that the act of 1873 operated and still
operates to decrease the per capita money
of the country.
In 1800 tne total money of the United
States was $5 27 per capita and $4 99 in cir
culation. In 1861, when the Republican
party assumed the direction of the affairs of
the Nation, the total per capita money was
$14 09, of which $13 98 was in circulation.
The highest point reached during the Civil
War was in 1865, when the total per capita
money was $22 16, with $20 57 in circula
tion. In 1873 the total money consisted of
$25,000,000 in specie and in round num
bers $750,000,000 of other forms of money,
which was $18 58 per capita, with $18 04 in
circulation. In 1880 we had a total per
capita of $24 04, of which $493,363,884 was
in specie, with a per capita circulation of
$19 41. The year 1890 opened with a total
per capita volume of $34 24, of which $22 82
was in circulation, and there was specie
aggregating $1,152,471,638. The per capita
circulation in 1890 was greater than in any
former year in tne history of the country
up to that time. In 1892 the specie reached
$1,234,588,789, with $36 21 per capita money
all told and $24 50 in circulation. In 1894
the total specie was $1,252,0.71,667, with a
totai per capita money amounting to
$35 44, of which $24 33 was in circulation.
The treasury statement for August, 1896,
based upon a population of 71,518,000,
shows the per capita circulation to nave
been $21 18.
Thus it will be seen that the official
tables of the Treasury Department flatly
contradict Mr. Bryan at every point, but
that will make no difference to the Demo
cratic candidate. He is not dealing in
f.icts, nor will he, for facts and his candi
dacy are diametrically opposed.
LADY'S CAPE.
The prevailing mode in autumn capes is the
rather short single cape with flariug collar.
Thss shape is choseu both for cloth and satin
or silk garments.
The former are perfectly plain, with machine
stitching around the edges, or are strapped in
various ways with the same goods. Borne have
! two or three straps aown the back. Others
i have cloth set on to form points.
Satin capes of black are fancifully trimmed
with ruffles of black chiffon and white, cream,
I or ecru lace. One had a flounce of chiffon
half its length, gathered into the neck. On
I this was a ruffle ot white lace two inches nar
rower, and over this again a ruffle ot chiffon,
two inches narrower than the lace. A ruche
of chiffon finished the neck.
Capes of gay Dresden bilk are stylishly trim
med with black chiffon or lace. Jet on net or
tulle is much used, in the shapes of yokes and
collars.
When ma<se of cloth the cape is seamless, but
narrow fabrics have a seam down the center
: back.

BRYAN'S MISTAKE.
Canton RepMltory.
Mr. Bryan, in his letter of acceptance, sayi
this year is not the time to talk tariff. In
view of the large and growing deficiency in
the National treasury, it Is necessary to con
sider tariff and revenues. Other people are
considering the subject, as Mr. Biyan will dis
cover when the votes are counted."
"Jobson, I do believe that if yon were given
your choice between me and your pipe, you
would hesitate."
"That's where you make a mistake, Mrs. Job
son, a pipe soothes and comforts a man in his
old age."â Nc W York Herald.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
W. H. Clary, owner of the famous Sheep
Ra rich gold property In Ca'.averas County, is
among the arrivals at the Lick.
Mr. Clary 1r credited with, being one of the
best informed mining men in the State. He
came to California as an early pioneer and has
been mining and running large ranches ever
since.
He has amassed a comfortable fortune and
some time ago took up bis residence in Stock
ton. Mr. Clary has an enormous acquaintance
up and down the coast, but particularly in
California, and people speak of him in words
of praise.
"I am not working the Sheep Ranch mine at
present," he said a day or two ago, "and there
is only a little mining work going on in that

immediate vicinity. Stockton, where I reside,
is fairly active and almost the same as it was
five or six months ago."
Mr. Clary never comes to the City that he
does not meet a small army of men whom he
has known in his mining experience. It was
thus at the Lick when he alluded to the busy
life he had led. He will be here two or three
days.

It Is simple wickedness for any intelligent
person to advocate depreciated currency and

Candidate Bryan assured the silverite com
mittee that his convictions on the silver ques
tion were not shallow. Few would have sus
pected it from his Incessant prattle. "The
shallows murmur, but the deeps are dumb."
Philadelphia Record (Dem.).
The closer Mr. Bryan's utterances are studied
the more apparent will be the shallowness of
his sopnistries, and the more widespread will
be the conviction that to place so loose a
thinker, so glib a talker and so reckless a
leader in the Presidential chair would be an
irreparable mistake.â Chicago Times-Herald.

NASBY ON SILVER.
Thi Question Discussed in Bascom's Stori
Eighteen Years Ago.
I alnt so certin that I want the silver bill
to pass ez I wuz. The fact is. the thing don't
work ez I spozed it wood, and 1 ain't clear onto
it. There is suttle principles in these finan
shel questions which require a great dccl uv
thought, and there is underlying principles
wich a man has got to understand afore he is
competent to set hisself up ez authority.
One thing I'm certain uvâ Bascom ain't no
finanseer, nor never will be, and I told him so.
"Wat Is a finanseer?" asked he.
"A finanseer," sed I, assoomin the look of
Dan'l Webster, "is a man wich kin pay his
debts with nothinâ a man wich kin git suthin
with nuthln'."
"The Corners, then, is full of finanseers, "he
remarked bitterly, castin a casual glance at
bis slate, wich wuz jist full enuff to turn over
and oegin on totber side.
But he hezn'tany uv the science uv it. I wuz
argooing with him the other day in favor of
my notion of a leather currency, though I
told him silver wuz much the same thing, and,
for example, I woud assoom that silver wuz to
be the currency uv the fucher.
"Now, don't yoo see, Bascom, thet ef I bed
twict ez much money I cooa drink twict ez
much whisky and pay for it?"
"How much is twice nothin'?" wuz the un
fee.lu answer uv the tyrant who holds the
destinies uv the Corners in his hands. That's
Â»Â»'â  yoor capital hez bin ever since I knowd
yoo."
"Parson," sed he, "I don't see wat erthlv
difference it's goin' to make whether silver is
currency or anything else. How are voo coin'
togitsi.veref it is made legal tender? Ef sil
ver wuz ez plenty ez bricks wat hey you got to
git any uv it with ?''
"Troo, G. W.," wuz my answer; "but can't
you see that to hey silver wood releeve the
liettor class? Even now, afore it is legal ten
der, it's only wuth 92 cents on the dollar, and
when the country is flooded with It v W ill go
still lower. Then we â or rather sich uv us ez
hey property to raise money onâ tin pay offâ"
"Eggsacily so," retorts Bascom; "you kin
pay me for the good, honist likker uv mine
wich you bey consoomed, in coin, which is
less than the dollar you promised. All rite.
But look here â come in here, all uv yoo. I
want yoo silver men to know exactly wat yoo
are ruthtn' into."
And this feend led us Into the back room
that back room which <y>ntanes the subsist
ence of the Corner?. There, in long rows, wuz
Bascom's stock. There, in barrils, piled one
on top uv another, wuz the df lishus whl.iky uv
Louisville, uv different ages, ranging from
turn uv two weeks old to that wich hed jist
leu the still and was scarcely cold yit. There
It lay, and as my eye ranged affeckshunatety
over it I felt ef I cood he y the drink'.n' uv all
that likker 1 wood be content to lay down ana
die when the last drop wuz gone.
Bascuin p'inted to an immense tank wich he
hed erect id within a few days, with a pipe
running in from the roof.
"I shan't raise the price uv likker in conse
kence uv bein' paid for it in a depreshiated
currency!" sed he.
I fell on Bascom's neck, in an extacy uv de
lite, while the others shouted, "Rah for Bas
com!"
"G. W.," I remarkt, while teers suffoosed my
eves, "I never placed you much below the an
gels, but this generous act has hlsted yoo a
Hundred per cent in my estimashun. Bless
yoo, G. W., bless yoo."
"But I'll tell you what I sheldo. Dy yoo see
that tank?" sed he.
"May 1 ask wat that is for?" I sed.
'â¢Tuat tank will fill with ranewater," sed he.
"The moment yoo get to payin' me in silver I
shel take out uv each uv them barrils jist eggs
ackly three and one-fifth gallons uv likker and
till it with water."
"Mercitul hevings!" we all exclaimed, "and
yoor likker so weak now!"
'And when silver gits down to 75 cent 3on
the dollar I shel take out 25 per cent uv
whisky and fill her up 25 per cent of water.
And soon down. Ef silver goes up I shel add
whisky eggsackly in proporstaen. In short,
my whisky Is jist agoiu' to foller currency,
and nothin' shorter. Yoo fellers wich work
lor wagis may swet, but I won't."
"But yoo'l increase the size of yoor glasses ?"
sed I.
"Not eny. But yoo may drink twice ez
many times to git the same amount uv drunk
ez before, by payin' for each drink."
And Baskom stalked hawtily back and took
his poslshen behind the bar.
Ther wuz cousternashun in the Corners sich
ea I hey never seen. Ther wuz a hurried con
sultashun at the deekin's house, and I sejestea
that we emancipate ourselves from the domin
yuu uv this tyrant by star'lin' a grosery uvour
own, on the joint-stock principle, which wuz
agreed to, each man agreein' to contrlbbit $10
to the capital stock, which would be enuff to
buy a barl or two, for a beginnin'.
We wuz enthoosiastic till wt come to bal
lotin* for the man to keep the place, when it
wuz found instid uv my bein' chosen yoonaui
musly, es I eggsuected to be, that every man
hed vot.d lor nisself. Ez not a soul uv them
would resede, the skeem wuz blocked rite
there, and finally hed to be abandoned and we
went back to Bascom's and submittid. That
tyrant hez us.
Uv course we can't stand likker dilootid in
that manner. We are willin' enuff to diloot
the currency with wich to pay fur likker, but
we want our likker fuil streugth. We coodent
help it, but that nite we signed and sent to our
Representative a remonstrance agiu' the silver
bill. The Cornt-rs is now for a. honest cur
rency. Wood, O wood, that we hed some uv it.

however, was never collected. These provi

RAINEY ACCEPTS
JAMES D. PHELAN
The Boys Had to Stand In

Art Critic.
THREATS TO KNIFE BOYD
Protection and the Rest of the
Ticket Promised for the
Nomination.
THE PLATFORM OF THE JUNTA.
Charles Wesley Reed Made Trouble
in a Race for the Stage to Talk
tor Phelan.
James D. Phelan was nominated for
Mayor by Sam Rainey's municipal con
vention last nitjht, because Rainey
"switched" during the day and decided to
accept Phelan and turn down Colin M.
Boyd.
This was not done because the anti-
Chairman Ragan Vainly Attempts
to Keep Order.
Raineyites succeeded in getting the con
vention away from the stableman at alt,
but because Rainey found it to be his best
political policy.
The friends of Phelanâ McNab, Hassett,
et al. â found that they could not win in a
fair test of strength, and so they yester
day organized a combination to back a
threat that they would "knife" Boyd if he
were nominated.
This threat was laid before Mr. Rainey,
accompanied by certain assurances that
if the new charter should be adopted and
if Phelan should be elected Mayor,
Rainey would be undisturbed in his pos
session of the Fire Department.
The deal further conceded to Rainey
George T. Marye Was One of the
. Big Goldbugs Who Looked
Serious and Said Nothing.
and Lanigan the Superintendent of
Streets and the Supervisorsâ all the pat
ronage left to seek this year.
On this sort of a basis Rainey gave
orders that Phelan was the *late candi
date, and he was named last night with
out opposition.
The fact tnat Phelan is a goldbug and
that he is so unpopular witn tlie practical
politicians made him a hard dose for the
boys constituting the Rainey majority in
the convention, but they obeyed orders
and silently swallowed him as far as the
nomination went.
Raim>y had "a walkover in naming
School Director Ambrose for Superintend
ent of Streets, and the slate went through
on the renomination of Broderick for Au
ditor, Creswell for City and County At
torney and Block for Tax Collector.
These incumbents were thus rewarded
for taking the Junta side a few weeks atro.
For Treasurer, William A^smusen was
named.
Odd Fellows' Hall was packed. Much
of the crowd was composed of enrioas
Buckleyites.
Chairman Ragan nearly let the conven
l tion get away from him two or three
times when there was slight cause for
restlessness, for his mild love-taps with the
gavel and his inoffensive commands were
not fearsome things.
Phelan got nominated, bnt the manner
of his nomination was npt accordine to
programme. Charles Wesley Reed was
not on the, slate for the nominating
speech, and there is a hot and eloquent
nominating speech prepared by ex-Senator
H. C. Gesford with much brain lag that
will never be heard.
It was arranged by Phelan and his chief
backers that "Gesford should nominate
him an 1 that M. C. Hassett and George T.
My ye should second the nomination.
Charles Wesley ReeU told Phelan during
the day that he was eoing to nominate
him. Phelan talked diplomatically and
told Hassett later.
Hassett bustled after Reed and told him
to keep his nose out of that business, and i
repeated the caution just before the con- i
tion met. But Reed told Chairman Ragnn, '
it in said, that he was going to nominate ,
Phelan, and when the time came Reed
was instant with his "Mr. Chairman," and
received recognition. â¢
Then Alex Vogeisane was as qnick to I
get the floor to second the nomination,
and Messrs. Gesford, HasÂ«ett and Marye
bottled up their wrath with their speeches

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
MR. HEARST'S SILVER MINES.
Object Lesson Showing Why the " Examiner " and
the "Journal " Feel Such a Lively Interest
in Free Coinage.
William R. Hearst owns the only newspaper in this City and the only newspaper in
New YOIK City that champions the free coinage of silver. In those papers day after
day Mr. Hearst declares that the free coinage of silver is a measure calculated to
benefit the workingman and him alone â that the rich men of the country are all
opposed to fren coinage.
However, in the inventory of the estate of Senator Hearst, left to Mrs. Hearst and
William R. Hearst, are found some facts and figures that would point to a very strong
personal interest in the free coinage of silver oh the part of Mr. Hearst himself.
Mr. Hearst is not a poor manâ not by a good many million dollars. Senator
Hearst left his widow and son over $5,000,000 worth of silver mining stockâ the exact
figure, as estimated by the appraisers, being $5,369,529 60. With the Anaconda stock,
not counted, as it has since been sold, the estate still owns $1,769,529 worth. This is
quite sufficient to fully account for Mr. Hearst's very lively interest in the success of
free silver.
Following is the appraisement of the mining stock alone left by Senator Hearst, the
silver mines being designated by heavy black type:

i reading of the minutes of the previotiÃ
i meeting were dispensed with.
Gallagher of the Thirty-fourth moved
that in viow of the decision of the Su
| preme Court that certain offices were not
i to be filled at the coming election, the re
j port of the committee of permanent
: organization and order of|business be re
ferred'back to that committee for amend
ment, in accordance with the decision.
Smith of the Thirty-fifth objected to
such a course, as a rehearing miuht be
a^ked for and granted and a change in the
present situation result.
He was assured by Euper.e N. Deuprey
that even if such a rehearing was granted
there was not the time to have the matter
rel>enrd an i decided before the day of
election. The motion was adopted and
tlie committee retired to revise the re
port.
Chairman Alexander Vogelsang of the
committee on platform read the platform.
It declares for religious and personal
liberty ; is in favor of a tax of $1 on $100 of
assessed valuation, exclusive of money
necessary for park and public square im
provements; promises fair and equitable
assessment of all property; indorses the
work of the Board of Health ; pledges the
party to the prompt and full payment of
teachers' salaries, and to street improve
ments brought about by economical and
business-like methods. * The repaying of
Market street is advocated and also the
lighting of Golden Gate Park with elec
tricity. It advocates the improvement of
the sewerage system ; favors the sale ot
franchises under restrictions that will
bring an annual revenue to the City; op
poses the funding bill; favors early clos
ing; favors the passage of a bill by the
Legislature declaring bicycles to be bag
gage; condemns the efforts made to re
vive outlawed claims to real property;
favors an improved ambulance service,
covered police patrol wagons; condemns
tne filthy condition of the City Hall; de
clares that the City should own its water
and light supplies and also telephone and
street railway franchises.
The cut-and-dried platform was supple-
! James F. Smith Vainly Tried to
Open the Way for Murasky's
Indorsement.
mented with the following rineing defi
ance aimed at the Buckleyites :
Your committee on platform and resolutions
recommend the adoption of the following res
olution:
No candidate who has received the nomina
tion of any other self-styled Democratic con
i veil li on nnd has not declined the same, snail
receive the indorsement of or be nominated by
tills convention.
Applause with automatic regularity
greeted the reading of each plank.
James F. Smith of the Thirty-fifth ruo
! mitted an amendment providing that the
candidates for judicial honors be exempted
from the resolution last read. He claimed
that no judicial candidate should stand
upon a platform and therefore he askÂ«d
the adoption of his amendment.
Finally the amendment was put to a
viva voce vote, but a division was de
manded. After the Twenty-tightb Dis
trict delegation had been polled Smith
| withdrew his amendment, and the report
as rend was adopted by acclamation.
J. A. Spinetti, chairman of the com
mittee on permanent organization and
order of business, read the report of that
Committee. It provided for the nomina
tion of the various county and municipal
offi -Â«rs, excepting those declared to hold
for tour years by the Supreme Court, and
recommended that the Assembly and
Sam Braunhart Again Mourned
the Triumph of Sam Rainey.
Senatorial district conventions meet on
the 21st and report their action to the
convention on the22d.. The recommenda
tion was amended so as to provide for the
meeting of the district conventions to
day and that they report to the conven
tion on the 21st. The report as amended
was adopted.
The next order of business was declared
to be the nomination of candidates for
Mayor. The convention, scenting the
smoke of battle, broke into wild applause.
Charles Wesley Reed ascended the plat
form amid yells ana stamping of feet.
"In times past," be began, "the Mayor
of San Francisco had some power, but in
recent times the Mayor has had no power,
because of the Supreme Court decision
that the Mayor bad no rij{ht to veto
measures passed by the Supervisors.
"It seems probable that the new charter
may be adopted â " fCries of "Never mind
the new charter," "Nominate the Mayor."]
Reed attempted to continue, and was
again interrupted with cries of "Dimondâ
nominate Dimond," "Name your candi
date."
"This is only an indication of the en
thusiasm with which the nomination will
be received by the people of San Francisco.
The peculiar circumstances of the past
few days should induce us to make his
nomination unanimous."
"No, no," came from the rear of the
hall.
"Some one may say 'no,' but the con
vention says 'yes,' and the people will
say 'yes, ! " retorted the speaker. He closed
with an eulogy of his nominee.
A. Vogelsang, in a few well-chosen sen
tences, seconded the nomination and Deu
prey moved that the nominations be
closed and Phelan be nominated by accla
mation. This was carried with but one
dissenting voice.
Nominations for Auditor being declared
in older, young George Gallagher of the
Tnirty-iourth District mounted the plat
form and told a story of how he had de
clined that evening to place a certain gen
tleman inf nomination, but had met that
gentleman later. That gentleman, hear
ing that Mr. Gallagher's excuse wad that
j be was not sufficiently eloquent, put bis
foot down rislit there.
"He said that he was out for office, and
that he did not need any eulogy in his
campaign." said Mr. Gatlacher. "It gives
me honor to name Ole Bill Broderick."
The nomination was quickly made by ac
ciamation.
There were cheers and "Ole Bill Brod
erick" was escorted to the platiorm,
where, after cheers, be said a few words of
thanks and of approval of the p!a:form,
especially that portion regarding taxation.
"Nominations for Tax Collector are in
order," said Chairman Ragan, giving
another love tap with his gavel. Eugene
N. Deuprey said some nice things about a
certain gentlemau, and then names James
N. Block, "and in presenting his name I
band to the secretary the ten-dollar piece,"
said Mr. Deuprey in closing.
Mr. Block's possible rivals were In
stantly shut off by the usuai closing mo
tion and the nomination was made by ac
clamation.
Mr. Block came to the stage and briefly
indorsed the platform, and as he retired
the committee of escort which had gone
after James D. Phelan entered the hall
with the nominee lor Mayor.
As the procession came down the aisle
and as Mr. Phelan was presented to the
convention there was enthusiastic cheer
ing from less than half the convention.
It was noticed that the Rainey forces re
mained silent. Mr. Phelan began as fol
lows;
"Mr. Chairman, fellow-Democrats and
fellow-citizens: This very great honor
that you have conferred upon me, coming,
as it has, unexpectedly â " .
This evoked first a titter and finally a
roar of derisive laughter from all over the
hall, in which the speaker could scarcely
refrain from joining. After giving the
mirthful demonstration ample time to ex
pend itself Mr. Phelan continued with
perfect self-composure :
"Gentlemen, I am reassured, for I see it
was not unexpected by you. But I say to
you that so far as 1 am concerned it is an
unexpected honor, and I appreciate it.
"I nave never before received a nomina
tion at the bands of a convention, and am
not familiar with the set words which you
may have reason with your varied experi
ence to expect. Bui what I say are words
of sincerity. I thank you heartily and
cordially."
He referred to his deep interest In the
welfare of the City, and promised if elected
to see that tne City was not plundered
and imposed upon as it had been in the
past â he would represent the City, he
said, as a good lawyer does his client; he
would faithfully protect its every interest;
he would stand between the City and
those who would take undue advantage
of it.
He added that he would again appear
before the convention at some future day,
alter he had read the platform, and would
then be prepared to indorse that docu
ment, which he understood, he said, whs
an excellent one. In conclusion he said
he would enter the contest with all his
energy, and strive not only for his own
election, but for the victory of the entire
municipal ticket which the convention
might name.
Once Mr. Phelan's speech was inter
rupted by a voice which cried, "How
about Bryan?" but the big gold man
noticed it not.
Osgood Putnam's motion that three
committees be appointed to severally
recommend nominations for the judiciary,
Board of Supervisors ana Board of Educa
tion was referred to the committee on
resolutions,
'â¢Honest Bill A.smussen" took his place
with "Honest Bill Broderick" on the tic
ket a few moments after nominations for
Treasurer werejcalled for, and W. J. Locke
had recommended him as worthy because
he had served in the Legislature.
Then came the nomination of a Super
intendent of Streets. "Ah! Ah!" said the
boys in chorus. This office belonged to
the Rainey boys. Rainey had made no
deal with the opposition in this patronage
office.
Joseph E. O'Donnell came forth toname
the Rainey candidate, W. F. Ambrose, the
School Director, who was asserted to be
a tried public servant. There was much
hurrah from the boys, and thirteen of
them moved that nominations close.
There were two other nominations, but
they were doomed to be swamped by the
great Rainey majority. James Denman
came to the platform, and in a few words
named Charles H. McGrcevy, who he said
was a man well known and respected, who
lived south of Market street, where wo ex
pect to get the most Democratic votes.
Frank P. Hughes norn nated Frank
Lester in a speech that would have beaten
his candidate anyhow if there had been
many votes in the convention not already
fixed.
Mr. Hughes mentioned the rumor that
a boss had captured the convention, and
said:
"I could not contain myself from com
ing before you to present a man whose
nomination would give the lie to that
calumny. It is true that mistakes which
are painful to refer to were made in the
temporary organization of this conven
tion. That this stigma may be wiped out
[many hisses] I wish to name the Hon.
Frank Lester."
"Mr. Chairman," cried Charles Wesley
Reed, "I wish to second the nomination
of Mr. Ambrose. He's a winner."
Rollcalf- proceeded. The Twenty-eighth
District gave thirty-one votes to Ambrose
and one to Lester. When the Thirty
seventh District was reached nearly every
vote bad gone to the Raihey candidate,
and the victory of Ambrose was plainly to
be overwhelming.
The names of Lester and McGreevy
were withdrawn, but the exultant Rain
eyites, who were anxious to display their
strength on the only issue the convention
afforded, shouted for the rolJcall to pro
ceed. But finally the nomination of
Ambrose was made by acclamation and j
the boys cheered and cheered agnin.
The youthful contractor and School
Director came to the platform and said a
few words, amid the affectionate greetings
of "Billy."
Eugene N. Deuprey nominated Harry
T. Creswell for City and County Attorney,
and amid the disorder of incipient ad
journment his nomination was made
unanimous.
Mr. Deuprey read a brief resolution in
dorsing the National ticket and tried to
get the convention to do the decent thing
by adopting it with cheers. As he read
'William Jennings Bryan" a delegate
shouted "Three cheers for Billy Ambrose"
and the cheers came. There was not a
cheer for Bryan.
Deuprey asked the resolution be adopted
without reference to the committee on
resolutions, and Chairman Ragan, with
another love-tap with his gavel, said, "If
there is no objection it is so ordered/ and
the resolution was not voted upon at all.
Deuprey frantically tried to get the chair
man to put the resolution to a vote, but
the confusion swamped it.
Not a voice was raised for W. J. Bryan
and nobody seemed to care.
The chairman announced several fol
lowing legislative conventions for Satur
day night and the convention adjourned
until Monday evening.

Deacon Jones' Escape From
Being Crushed to
Death.
A DUSKY LITTLE LAD.
The Hero of Many Battles Suc
cumbs to Vin ing's Trol
ley-Car.
HIS INTERESTING LIFE.
He Came Here as the Valet to
Clarence Greathouse, the Min
ister to Korea.
He is a little mite of a man, stocky in
build, a nose so flat that it takes up most of
his black face, which is illuminated by two
big eyes, the whites of which seem always
rolling. This is "Deacon" Jones, the
valet, coachman, wrestler and prize
fighter, who is very ill as the result of the
last encounter in which he engaged, on
the 16th of this month.
The "Deacon," who has fought more
men than he has fingers and toes, who
has never suffered defeat in the prize
ring or out of it, and whose boast that no
man who breathes of his eize â 4 feet 2
inches â could throw him in a wrestling
bout, struck a game, or rather was struck
by it, to which his sturdy little frame had
to succumb.
It was on Wednesday afternoon last,
when the '"Deacon" was making his way
home and crossing Mission street, at the
corner of Fourth. The little fellow was
deep in thought and unmindful of car
1165, westward bound, which was rapidly
bearing down upon him. The motorman
apparently did not see the little bit of hu
manity on the track, and, to the horror of
the passengers on the dummy, the col
lision occurred. There was a sickening
thud, and the "Deacon" went down.
The car was brought to a halt thirty
feet away and a rush was made to see
what had become of the little colored fel
low. Bruised, bleeding and generally dis
figured, with but a few strip* of clothing
left, he was found wedged partly under
the fender, which had rolled and pushed
him all that distance.
Passers by helped him to his feet and
the last the passengers saw of him was as
he was rolling his eyes in the direction of
the vanishing car.
But the "Deacon" is a very sick little
man and bis friends have to take gooa
care of him to pull him through.
The history of "Deacon" Jones ia some
what interesting.
When Clarence Greathouse, the promi
nent attorney and United S:ates Minister
to Korea, came to California from the
South he brought Jones with him. This
was about fifteen years ago and the lad
was only nine years of age. He -was
solemn of visage and filled with that sort
of religious superstition not unusual to
the people of his race living on planta
tions in the South. Greathouse dubbed
his valet "Deacon" and to this day the
little dusky fellow does not know himself
by any other name.
Greathouse was a lover of sports and
always took his boy with him wherever he
went. It was in the days when Harry
Maynard was in the zenith of his fame
and was coining money in his sporting
resort on Dupont street, bringing together
prize-fig liters, professionals and amateurs
of more or less note, for the amusement of
his patrons.
One night a big Swedish sailor on May
nard:s stage whipped a much smaller man
than himself, but his work was so clumsy
tnat the "Deacon," who had learned a
thing or two about the sport his master
loved so much, exclaimed:
"He's no good. I can do him myself!"
Greathoase admired the spunk of the
boy and decided to "try him ouu"
The match was arranged, and sure
enough "Deacon" chopped the big Swede
to pieces. The big fellow couldn't hardly
reach the black boy's hard head, it was so
far below him, and the little fellow
pitched in regardless of consequences,
beating an uncomfortable tattoo on the
other fellow's wind and winning a purse
of nearly as much as $3 50 â a big one in
those days for impromptu set-tos.
As soon as the "Deacon" learned be was
a pugilist, he forsook his master and was

Interesting Items for Wheelmen,
Anglers, Marksmen, Boxers
and Others*
In wheeling circles the event of greatest
importance is the five-mile road race
which will be held to-morrow on the road
to San Jose between the Olympic and
Garden City Cycling clubs.
The boxers ars quiet, comparatively, as
the excitement attending politics has
thrown a damper on fisticuffs and other
sports. But there are two entertainments,
nevertheless, on the slate for next month.
The sportsmen are winding up the trap
shooting season and making ready for the
season when duck and quail can be law
fully killed. In the following columns
will be found the very latest sporting
news:
THE WHEELMEN.
Entries and Handicaps for the
Olympic-Garden City Roadrace.
It was a very clever idea that the Olym
pic Club Wheelmen and the Garden City
Cyclers hit upon when they decided to
hold a joint five-mile roadrace, as is evi
denced by the interest that is being taken
in such an event to be run to-morrow
morning over a new course, starting near
Milpitas and finishing at the junction of
the Ban Jose and Gish roads. The novelty
of the thing and the friendly rivalry be
tween the riders of the two big clubs led
to quite a large entry list, and if all come
to the scratch there will be forty-two
starters, who have oeen allotted handicaps
varying from nothing to three minutes, as
follows:
J. A. Vaugrhan, 3 mm.; P. Schwab, W. Mackie,
A. St G. Cooper, 2:20: D. Baker, L. Whiting,
K. Boyd, 2:10; 8. E. Johnson. H. Chase, H. G.

George E. Kroetz, :25 ; J. E. Wing, C. M. Smith,
George W. Tantau, scratch.
The race is scheduled to start promptly
at 11 o'clock. The Olympic Club Wheel
men will have a run dowu from here, tak
ing the 6:30 a. m. boat, and the Garden
City Cyclers will ride out from San Jose. '
leaving at 9. The race has attracted the I
attention of the other clubs and a large
number of riders intend going down to
witness it. After the race there will be
a barbecue and the balance of the day will
be spent at Alum Rock.
The officials will be: Al Col, referee;
B.USS, Osen, Swam, Hunter and Desimone,
judges; Wetmore, Hadenfeldt, Alexander,
Spring, Nash, .Bailey and Montealegre,
timers; Spillane, Muller, Meherin, Butler,
Jury, Chase, Scott and Platt, scorers;
Stratton, Hahn and Lipsett, starters;
PJagemann and O'Brien, marshals.
Tantau and Wins of the Olympics ride
together from the scratch mark, and they
have a score to settle, as the former beat
Wing in the last five-mile race and Wing
doesn't intend it shall De repeated to
morrow.

THE GUN.
Slaughtering Ducks Near Chloo.
Trap-Shootlngr Tournament.
To-morrow the Reliance Gun Club of
Oakland will hold a final club shoot and
free-to-all shoot at the grounds near Web
ster street, and the Lincoln Club will have
an outing at Greenbrae, during which
several contests in Jive-bird shooting will
be decided. The Golden Gate Gun Club
will give its first tourney at its customary
place of meeting.
October 2 and 3 the State Sportsmen's
Association will meet at San Bruno, where
live-bird shooting will be tli* order of the
days' sport, and on October 4 and 5 the
great artificial tournament of the Inani
mate Target Association wili be held at
San Jose. This will come pretty near
winding up the trap-shooting for the sea
son, as on October 15 sportsmen can tramp
the hills in quest of quail, or take a se
creted position on the margin of some
Bond on the marshes and blaze away to
their heart's content at wild ducKs of
divers breeds and colors.
A. M. Barker, president of the Garden
City Cyclers' Gun Club, has issued the
following circular to sportsmen:
Tne members of the Garden City Cyclers'
Gun Club, under whose auspices our next
tournament will be held, hereby send greet
ing* and call your attention to the following
facts:
The prize committee has secured $400 in
cash, which, added to the amount of coin
given by the association, will make at least
$1200, to be distributed at our coming shoot,
which Is far in advance of any previous
amount given in cash prizes. This taken with
our mffny valuable trophies and merchandise
prizes will make a grand total.
There will doubtless be a system of dividing
prizes adopted, insuring a wider distribution
than heretofore, not permitting so much to co
to one shooter. This matter will be thorough
ly discussed at a meeting of the tournament
committee with a view to the welfare of the
greatest number.
The grounds will be located a few blocks
west of Hotel Vendome. Cars pass the hotel
and land you at the traps in five minutes.
We will be glad to secure accommodations
for any and all clubs who so desire.
Five sets of electric pull traps will bs used.
Men will do the trapping, and competent
judges and referees will be secured.
Bring large delegations from every club and
make this tournament a world-beater.
There will be an ample supply of ammuni
tion of every kind on the grounds for sale
cheap.
The programme will be Issued as soon as
possible. A. M. Barker,
President Garden City Cyclers' Gun Club.
According to The Call's Sacramento
correspondent, whose weekly article ap
pears on this pace, the residents of Chico
and that vicinity have been shooting
wild ducks for some days past. As there
is no one to interfere with the hunters it
is. presumed that they will continue to
bag the wild game which the law protects
until October 15. The officers of Teham a
and Colusa counties should read up the
law in this particular and teach the
transgressors of it a lesson in duck
shooting that will prove so instructive as
to remain indelibly stamped on their
memories.
The Supervisors of any county cannot
legally open the season for shooting game
of any description prior to the time the
State law takes effect. The Supervisors
can shorten the season in their respective
counties after October 15, when it will be
lawful to shoot small game, such as ducks,
quail, etc. Professional hunters should
remember that the season when wild
duck may be sold is yet far off; but tiien,
there are many birds being smuggled into
this City under the very noses of the Game
Warden and Deputy Fish and Game Com
missioners.
The following letter to The Call from
Oregon speaks for itself:
Elk Hotel, Elk City, Or. , Sept. 10.
A party comprising Mr. and Mrs. George B.
Roop of Gilroy Hot Springs, Misses Kitty and
Genevleve Nulau, Fred W. Tallant, J. Homer
Fritch, George Kingston, William H. Cun
ningham and William F. Shattuck of San
Francisco are passing several days here on
their way to Albany on an elk-hunt expedi
tion. They have landed as many as 250 troui
a day. Mr. Tallant, being over-zealous to
prove nig piscatorial abilities, lost his balance
and was soon carried away by the impetus of
the river. Had it not been for the heroic
efforts of the ladies the Country Club wouli
now be mourning one of its most popular
members. The party continue their trip to
morrow.
Frank Lecosta and William Brown,
members of the Tamalpais Gun Ciub of
San Francisco, killed two bucks last
Wednesday a week aeo. The hunting
territory of this club is from the summit
of Tamalpais to the ocean and includes
about 17.000 acres. There has been god&t
hunting there this year, and seventeen
deer in all have fallen to the rifle. There
are two trout streams and quail in abun
dance. This club comprises a member
ship of about twenty-six.
THE ANGLER,
Winding Up the Season on Eel
Riverâ The Black Bass.
There are six weeks more open to
anglers who fancy trout-fishing, and quite
frequently the last month of the year
proves to be the best.
F. H. ileed. with Messrs. Bogard and
Eramona of the Fly-casting Club, took a
flying trip to Boca last Saturday. On
Sunday they went down the river as far
as Floriston and Mr. Reed caught two
3J^-pound trout on minnows. La Fonee
caught a five-pounder on a minnow,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
which he states was the gazneat fish he
ever landed. Bogard and Emmons had
only fair luck, as the trout are still feed
ing on the bottom.
Thomas Flyun of the Wasp returned
from Boca recently. He contends that
Boca is an angler's paradise and that John
McDonald is a prince of good fellows.
Fiynn caught the river when the Tahoe
gates were closed and he had royal sport.
Green, Morehouse and Jones have just
arrived from Duncans Mills. They report
that the black bass have quit feeding and
that very little sport will be had during
the balance of the season, which will not
end until January. Frank Hofling shipped
eight fine bass last week from Duncans
Mills to a friend. Frank did not say how
he got them, but it is rumored that there
are seme young boys living at Duncans
Mills who are expert bass catchers.
John Butler received a splendid mess of
rainbow trout yesterday from Stony
Brook, in Colusa County. They were
shipped at the suggestion of Fred Drink
house, who was on a. visit to that part of
the country.
If a heavy rainstorm should arrive be
fore the end of the month the anglers who
have planned a big hsbing excursion to the
Eel River will geA sadly disappointed.
Don't wait for to<fmuch rain, gentlemen.
The resignation of Fish Commissioner
Murdoca was a surprise to his many
friends, who expected him to remain on
deck.
The black bass that are being caught in
the Spring Valley Water Company's lakes
taste strongly of decayed vegetation, and
in fact are unfit to eat. If the tons of dead
weeds were removed the water and nshes
would improve in flavor.
THE BOXERS.
Club Fights That Will Take Place
Next Monthâ The Big Guns.
The Occidental Athletic Club is san
guine of having a full house on the even*
ing ot October 8, when Tom Tracey, the
clever Australian, will try conclusions
with George Green, the Olympic Club
favorite. Green is now in the pink of con
dition and proposes to lake only very
light exercise until the first of next
month, when he will put on the finishing
touches. Tracey will find Green a more
clever man than Billy Gallagher, but not
such a' wicked fighter as the lad who re
fused to meet the Olympian recently
under the auspices of the National Club.
Aenew and Kelly, who will "put up"
the star event of the evening during the
Armory Club's entertainment, should give
the members a good show. They are both
stiff punchers and although Agnew is
iiked by the talent on account of the ex
cellent showing he made against Billy
Akers there are many of the sports who
fancy the "spider," who is just about as
artful as the webmaker.
The pugilists must weigh in at 135
pounds at noon on the day of the fight.
The winner will receive $600 and the loser
$200. Jimmy Anthony will have some
trouble disposing of tricky Danny
Mahoney, who has been substituted for
Fay, whose heart failed him when he was
called upon to sign articles. Tom Oooney
will, it is thought, be easy game for the
chunky Australian, who has contracted to
stop both fighters.
Anthony will go on with Mahoney first
in a six-round bout and then he will have
a try at Cooney after the eight-round mill
between Billy Shannon and Billy Lewis,
which is not looked upon as being much
of a drawing card. Those two last-named
Knights of the mittens will receive $400 â a
most liberal offer, by the way, consid
ering.
If Anthony succeeds in stopping his
men he will receive $250 for each contest,
and should be fail he will be presented
with the "munificent" sum of $50. But
Jimmy is sanguine of success, and unless
Mahoney gives him too hard a run in the
Belling race for bantams the Australian
should certainly dispose of Cooney in short
order.
The National Club has not yet succeeded
in capturing the Sharkey and Corbett
match, but Sharkey and Corbett came
near capturing the National Club, which
institution had promised them a $20,000
purse. But the champion got too many
irons in the fire and as a revult he is now
groomed in a hot box between the Aus
tralian and fie sailor. The National Club
recently offered Corbett and Sharkey
$10,000 for a ten-round contest in this
City, but James is still trying to figure
out why the National Club cannot bid
higher. He certainly is foolish to let an
offer as good as this pass through his
fingers, as it may "be bis last chance to
pocket a cool $10,000, which sum be can
make in thirty seconds or less by besting
the man of small eyes ana big muscles,
who has been recently dubbed in the East
"Picture Gallery Tom" owing td*his strong
predilection for photographs of himself.
As to the meeting between Corbett and
Fitzsimmons it can he fittingly styled a
paper chase, as the result will be a run
across country with one trying not to
catch up with the other. â¢
CRICKET CHIRPS.
The Approaching: End ot the Harrl-
son Cup Fight.
But nine more interclub cricket matches
for the Hunter Harrisen cup remain to ba
played. The first of these will come off
to-morrow at Alameda, the Alameda and
Bohemian clubs being the contestants
The game is likely lo be a very interesting
one, for should the Alameda men come off
victorious it might affect the ultimate
order of the competing clubs. At present
the Bohemians are in the lead, closely fol
lowed by the Pacifies, the Alarnedas and
Californias being fixed in the van.
By the departure yesterday of H. H.
Richardson for Santa Monica the Pacifies
suffer an irreparable loss, for he is un
questionably the best bat in the associa
tion. His 208 made against the Califor
nias some weeks ago was the highest score
ever made on the coast, beating the pre
vious record held by Captain W. Robert
son by just two runs. Only last Sunday
he made 104 (and retired) in the Pacific-
California match at Golden Gate, and sev
eral other big scores are to be found
against his name.
The English season is being wound up
by the customary cricket "festivals." By
latest mailed reports Scarborough was in
terested over a figrht between M. C. C. and
Ground and Yorkshire. At Hastings the
Australians met the South of England vet
erans and in the first inning scored 222.
their opponents making 154 for eiiht wick
ets. In the latter score Champion "W. G.
Grace contributed 53 in his old-time man
ner.
The Australians left Southampton for
New York on the Bth inst. Their fixtures
onthi.side are as follows: Sept. 18, vs.
Philadelphia; Sept. 23, vs. New Jersey
Athletic Cinb; Sept. 25, vs. Philadelphia;
Oct. 2, vs. Philadelphia; Oct. 7, vs. Chi
cago.
W. B. Webster,, late of the Bohemians,
wiU keep wickets in the New Jersey match.
The Australians will spend two clear
days in this City prior to their departure
for Auckland on the Mariposa. Why
should not some kind of a game be ar
ranged by "the powers that be" of the
association ?
Last Saturday the All Oregon team
played Portland at Multnoraah field, Poit
land. After the former had made 101 for
two wickets, Captain Lawrence, who had
54 not out. called the innings. He risked
too much, apparently, for the Portland
men went in and made 103 for the loss of
a single wicket, thus winning with flying
colors.
The Yorkshire team are to present a
valuable iÂ« stimonial to Lord Hawke, who
has captained them through eleven sea
sons of championship honors.

FOOTBALL.
Olympic and Reliance Expect to
Win the Early Games.
The two big athletic clubs have entered
upon the football training season with
more than usual zeal and more than ordi
nary material from which to form formid
able elevens. The university teams may
CROSS, the Stanford Coach: "We must win that game."
well beware, as both Reliance and
Olympic have started early and with a
larger percentage than ever before of
players fresh from the college gridiron.
These college veterans will not permit the
suggestion that they have so soon become
back numbers, and" they are out deter
mined to win the early names, when they
know that they will have a certain ad
vantage of training over the collegians.
There iÂ« a pretty side contest on between
the athletic clubs to retain all the most
desirable men. Reliance and Olympic
both swear they have Sexton, tackle for
Olympic last season. Nanl and Middle
mas went over to the enemy across the
bay, but Manager Sheehan still has hope,s
of winning back Nahl, whose father was
one of the founders of the Olympic Club.
Both Captain Walton and Manager
Sheehan are now out hunting tor Comic
Jones, the old Stanford hero and phenom
enal kicker, whose college football days
were ended by a series of broken bones.
Jones is living in this City.
"The Olympics," said Manager Jack
Sheehan yesterday, "are practicing regu
larly every evening now at Central Park
from 5:30 on, with Stickney of Harvard
coaching. The work is light, but the men
are doing a good deal of running. Stick
ney is paying particular attention to
Weldon and Theerkauf, both of whom are
punting well. The men take their meals
at a cafe near by and each one pays for his
own, as the club is not maintaining a
regular training-table.
"The daily practice beginning next week
will alternate between the Peerless Club
team and our own second eleven. I hope
also to arrange some games for Saturdays
and Sundays with outside clubs in addition I
to the big matches already scheduled with j
Stanford, - Berkeley and Reliance. The |
universities have agreed this year not â  to j
send their second elevens against either of |
the big athletic club teams, so every game '
will be a match of the best of each, and |
not in any sense a practice contest. I '
think both Reliance and Olympic, with
their unusually fine prospects, - can beat
the university teams in the first matches, I
and that is why Â«f c are doing all this early
training."
. Captain Harry Walton of the Reliance
yesterday said: "Every night this week
we've had twenty men out 'for practice
on the Piedmont grounds, and that's a
good sign so early in the season. After our j
exercise we go to the Piedmont baths, and i
later to a restaurant on Broadway. On
Tuesday and Thursday we practice with
St. Mary's College, â  and on three other
evenings of the* l week play against our
second eleven. Reliance will have a fairly
heavy line, but light men back di the line,
so we will naturally play an open running
game, -relying a good deal upon fast
backs." ' v v-i

Stanford men are enthusiastic over the
coming of Cross as coach. It was he who
lowered Robert Edgren's color%when the
University of California team made its
Eastern tour last year. *
His record with - the i 16-pound hammer
is 135 feet, and with the 16-pound sheft

can sprint 100 yards in 11 seconds.

handsome, but what the football men will

enthusiastic, and yet with an air of : deter- 4

him seem no idle boast.

COURSING.
Match at Ocean View Between Move
On and St. Cloud.
Interest in the meeting at Ocean View
to-morrow has been largely increased by
the match race between Move On, a
snappy little Skyball-Vallcy Queen pup,
and St. Cloud, J. Lennon's fast pup out ot
Watte lblooTi by Lord Clifton.
The match is for $25 a side, beat two out
of three, and as both of the youngsters
have been in hard training since the con*
test was arranged a splendid run is ex
pected.
Tim Cronin'* black and white bitch
Rosa B has been missing since September
9 and her owner believes that she has
been stolen. Rosa B was one of the
veteran coursing man's favorite dogs and
he is very anxious to recover possession
of her.
The drawing for to-morrow's coursing
at Ingleside took place on Thursday even
ing at Delta Hall and resulted in thirty
six dogs being matched as follows:
H. Spring's Premier vs. J. Laskey's Gallop
ing; Robinson & Peyton's Red Rover vs. M.
O'Connor's Lady Clifton; E. Dunn's Snowbird
vs. Richmond kennel's Uncle Sam; Robiflson

Twenty-eight excellent dogs were drawn
at Delta Hall last evening for the running

Tennis Notes.
Wrenn, Tamed and iÂ«eel, the tennis
champions, 1 wili very probably be here by
the middle of next week, and the post
poned tournament between them and the
local cracks, the Whiting and Hardy
brothers, will very probably take place on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the 25th,
26th and 27th. In a telegram received
from Can Neel he ttates that owing to
the big tournament in Chicago last Tues
day they will not be able to start before
to-day; he also says he thinks Tamed
will surely come.
It was owing to this latter player's ill
ness that the previous dates for their ar
rival were canceled, and at one time it
looked as though the clubs would miss
securing this most brilliant performer,
but now everything seems clear for the
original two playing here within the next
two weeks.
Handball.
The following handball games will be
played in Phil Ryan's court, 858 Howard
street, to-morrow:
P. Kelly and P. Hutchinson vs. G. Hutchin
son and J. McEvely; R. Shea and R. Shields vs.
T. Sullivan and T. O'Donnell ; D. Rodgers and
P. Ryan vs. M. McXeil and G. McDonald; M.
Edwards and J. Collins vs. R. Murphy and W.
Stansbury; J. Riordan 'coast champion) and
M. J. KUgallon vs. J. C. Nealon and T. F.
Bonnet.
At the Union court Lew Mayhew and J.
Roger will play J. Lavigne and C. Challoe;
R. Murphy and Jap Lyons will play T. E.
Willey and M. Tierney ; J. Flynn and R. Dris
coll will play M. Tierney and J. Burnell; C.
Carson and W. Prince will play G. McGuire
and J. Collins. The event of the day will be a
match game between the heavy-weights, J.

gallon and Terry McManus.
Sacramento Sporting: News.
The failure of R. A. Terrell to make any Kind
of a showing against the trotting-horse Plunk
ett at the State Fair track on Wednesday on his
bicycle has been a source of grear disappoint
ment to the local lovers of the wheel, all of
whom were greatly interested in the result of
the race. They, however, attribute Terrell's
defeat to the fact that while the track was con
sidered fast for horses it was altogether too
soft for a bicycle, as in many spots Terrell sank
over his rims, and claimed that the going was
like wheeling through heavy sand, particu
larly was this the case on reaching the three
quarter pole. Up to this point Terrell had en
countered no difficulty in keeping up with the
horse. \
The cinder paths of the Capital City Wheel
men are in excel lentcondition and are greatly
patronized. On the Folsom path the other
day a green wheelman made twenty-two miles
in one hour and forty minutes, and then re
turned over the same distance in one hour
and forty-three minutes.
The iocal gunstores are more than busy at
the present time, as sportsmen are making
preparations for the coming fall snort, whicn
in this county promises to be better than It
has been known in many years. From' the
lakes and marshes south of the city reports
have been received to the etfect that ducks
and snipe are plentiful, and the same may be
said of the Washington Lake district.
J. C. Myers and brothers of Dixon are In
town making preparations for a'huntlng ex
cursion into Southern Oregon.it being their
intention to spend at leiist two months on
Klamath Lake in small-game hunting. Pine
ton of Winters is also here, preparing for an
outing trip. He intends going up on the Hum
boldt for a month's deer hunt
Parties from Chico state that the duck
hunting season in their district is now on, and
that all who have been out have had excellent
luck, birds being plentiful and fat. Local
sportsmen have been too taken up with the
racing events at the park during the past two
weeks to find time for hunting, especially as
the doves are flocked, preparatory to migrat
ing.
The coming boxing-match between L. A.
Payne of this city and Stewart Carter of the
Olympic Club, before the Rio Vista Club, is
engaging all the attention of the athletes and
they are making preparations to attend in a
body, having engaged a special steamer to
convey them down the river. Payne is by no
means fit for the contest, as he has been work
| ing too hard in the bicycle line and haa not
had time to get in fighting trim, in conse
quence his* friends are not in t i best feather
over the outcome, as they fully realize that
Carter is a good man, who has made their
favorite look to his laurels on two former oc
casions.
Fishing and tennis are at a standstill at
present, but will be booming as soon as the
fair comes to an end. Rutherford.
Vlsalla Sporting News.
Editor Callâ Since my last letter the newly
organized Eshom Valley Gun and Fish Club
has received and planted 50,000 young trout.
Most of the fish were planted in the north fork
of the Kaweah P.iver, just below Eshom Valley,
and the balance in Redwood Creek, In Red
wood Canyon.
Last Friday when Messrs. Ellis and Pattee
were informed by J. Sub Johnson, the popular
secretary of the Visalia Sportsman Club, that
the fish would arrive in the evening, both of
them were like a fish out of water, but in a few
minutes calmed down, and it was decided that
Mr. Pattee should start out for Eshom Valley
ana have pack horses in raadiness to transfer
the cans on the arrival of Mr. Ellis with the
consignment in the wagon.
Since the organization of the club, Eshom
Valley is now seriously thinking of branching
out as a summer resort. It was my good for
tune to meet that grand old G. A. R. veteran,
bear-hunter, etc., Tom East, and in a chat he
informed me that up to date six applications
had been received by the club for cottages
next summer.
Last Tuesday the local Examiners were de
feated by the Alerts oi Alameda by a score of
11 to 2. Our boys have filed a protest on the
ground of unfair decisions by Umpire Lowrie.
He is also accused of using signals to the
Alerts' batsmen.

AN UNEXPECTED VISIT,
Members of the Board of Health
Inspecting Water
Supplies.
Park and Castro Heights Reservoirs
Are Sampled for Rigid
Analysis.
Suddenly and without any unnecessary
flourish of trumpets the water committee
of the Board cf Health, consisting of Drs.
Hart and Williamson, Professor Wenzell,
the chemist, and Dr. Spencer, the bacteri
ologist, made a descent on the park and
Sutro Heights water supplies yesterday
afternoon and procured a anantity of
samples that will be analyzed chemically
and microscopically for impurities that
may be detrimental to health.
The board decided on this inspection
some time ago, but in order to throw the
owners of the supplies off their guard
and keep them from concealing the true
state of affairs by a temporary cleanup for
the occasion, the visit was put off until a
favorable opportunity presented itself, the
party being called together at a moment's
notice yesterday-
The park supply, from appearances, was
not above suspicion, but the members ex
pressed no ideas on the subject, seemingly
preferring to wait until the analysis de
termines the quality.
At Eighteenth and Collingwood streets a
reservoir was found where the water was
clearly stagnant, and old boots and cans
were plentiful.

VITAL ISSUES TOUCHED.
The Nebraskaa's Speeches Said
to Be Entirely Devoid
cf Logic.
McKinley sure of election.
Sentiment From Now Until Votes
Are Cast Will Grow in His
Favor.
The iollowing article, written by a well
known Democrat, was published early
this month in tne Nation, one of the lead
ing periodicals of Germany, whose editor,
Dr. Theodor Barth, has come to this
country to watch the progress of our elec
tions:
"In about two months it must be de
cided whether William Jennings Bryan or
William McKinley is to be President.
"The Populists have indorsed Mr. Bryan
for the Presidency, but nominated
Thomas K. W T atson, a violent partisan
from Georgia, as Vice- President, because
they despise Arthur Sewall, the wealthy
shipbuilder from Maine. Neither Watson
nor Sewall can be induced to withdraw.
As Bryan insists upon retaining Sewall he
may lose votes of Southern Populists who
decline to vote for him.
"A description of the strange product of
our Western country who, by accident,
came suddenly into prominence, must be
of interest. Born in March, 1860, at
Salem, 111., William J. Bryan has by age
just become eligible. His father, a Vir
ginian by birth, was for many years State
Senator and Judge in Illinois. His means
enabled the son to enjoy the advantages
of a good education. *At the ace of
12 William was already allowed to
address a political meeting. The
audience began by laughing at the boy
orator, but soon listened to him with at
tention. He studied law in college and in
the office of Lyman Trurnbull in Chicago,
famous by his dratt of the thirteenth
amendment to the constitution, which
legalized the emancipation of slaves.
Graduating in 1881, Mr. Bryan moved, in
1387, to Lincoln, Nebr., where he devoted
himself to politics. In 1S8& he won his first
laurels by a passionate speech in favor
of free trade. Elected to Congress in
1890, ne was appointed a member of the
Waya and Means Committee, and distin
guished himself in the cause of tariff re
form. As a friend of Richard Bland he
became the most violent advocate of free
silver coinage when he was re-elected in
1592. At the end of this term in 1894 he
accepted a position as editor of the Omaha
World-Herald.
"After his admission to the bar he mar
ried Mary Elizabeth Baird, a clever young
woman and iellow law student, now the
better lawyer of the pair. She takes deep
interest in the political advancement of
her husband, assists In the preparation of
his speeches and makes hosts of friends by
her tact and amiability, never neglecting
her duties as housewife and mother. She
commands universal respect.
"Mr. Bryan speaks with apparent sin
cerity; his manner is simple yet earnest,
bo that it curries conviction. Intelligent
men have remained spellbound under the
influence of his silver tongue, although he
seldom says what :a worth hearing. In
toxicated by the exuDerance of his own
verbosity, he has the faculty of speaking
without saying anything. Coming to Cni
cago to claim a seat in the conven
tion, which had been contested, silverites
awarded and gave to him an opportunity
of delivering that wonderful address
which secured his nomination. One of its
captivating phrases, 'Protection has slain
thousands, the gold standard tens of thou
sands, 1 is a fair example of the rest.
"Traveling from Nebraska to New York
to be 'notified of his nomination.' he se
lectea slow trains because he could speak
from the platforms of their cars wherever
curiosity drew a crowd. That a possible
President should exhibit himself like a
mountebank was a humiliating spectacle
even to Western politicians. His hand
became sore from shaking and his voice
hoarse from speaking, co that he could
Lardly be heard when he delivered his
oration of acceptance in the vast expanse
of Madison-square Garden. This the
atrical performance failed, because he
read his part instead of speaking it as he
was accustomed. The people who had
come to listen to a Demosthenes, left when
they heard an essay of a college
rrofessor. More than a third of the
hall, which accommodates 10,000 specta
tors, was empty before he finished. Ap
plauded for socialistic expressions his al
lusions to finance were listened to in
silence. Again and again he asserted
that we could raise the value of an ounce
of silver to $1 29 in gold by free coinage,
but produced no arguments to show how
it could be done. Here is one of
the plittering phrases of the lec
ture: 'The gold standard has been weighed
and found wanting; it encourages hoard
ing, discourages enterprise and paralyzes
industry. 1 The opposite is true. Money
is hoarded in India and China, while it
circulates freely in England and Germany.
Industries flourish where people havecon
lidence in the stability of values; they
languish wherever that is wanting.
"Of medium height *nd pleasing man
ners, Bryan knows how to win the hearts
of men by a musical voice and genial
smile; politically a demagogue, he bears
the reputation of a good Christian and
honest man in private life.
"Many theories of our Silverites are
crude, so that it is incomprehensible how
they could influence a well-balanced
mind. Some claim it would be an
advantage if our credit were im
paired, as we would have to rely then
on our own resources, and could show
what he could do 'without the money
changers and vampires of Lombard street.'
A majority have nothing to lose; in their
opinion any change could not injure, but
might benefit them. To call their atten
tion to the fact that their labor would
be paid for in depreciated money will
not frighten them, because they ex
pect to get that money without working
for it. The platform of tne Populists
favors an issue of irredeemable money
wnich is safe and sound and is to be dis
tributed through lawful disbursement of
the Government. One of the measures
openly advocated in St. Louis whs a free
gift to the people of the imaginary profit
which the treasury had made by coining
silver into standard silver dollars. That
this 'profit,' called seigniorage, should be
coined and turned into the treasury, had
been proposed in Congress; the Populists
seem to have a better use lor it.
"Bryan mizbt hive been successful if
under toe influence of spontaneous popu
lar enthusiasm for these vagaries the elec
tion had taken place immediately after
the Popocratic nominations. (Since the
fusion of Populists with Democrats
the combined party has been called
Popocratic) The poor were then
aroused against the rich, farm
ers against city folks. McKinley's fol
lowers were called the 'Shylocks of Wall
street and 'plutocrats -of New England '
A. woman by the name of Penninjrton
draped in our flae, appeared on the platl
form of the convention and deligntedthe
audience by singing 'Kill the goldbugs
Â« ver y one, 1 to the tune of 'Yankee
Doodle I*
"Opinion has gradually changed; irom
day to day it becomes clearer that the
movement is a skillful conspiracy between
interested mmeowners and ambitious poli
ticians whom they secured as their advo
cates. These furnish ammunition to their
opponents by the very falsehoods which
they continue to spread because they fail
to substantiate them. Bourke Cockran,
Benjamin Harrison and other able men of
j U i Parties are exposing these impostors
and leave deep impressions on the public
mind wherever thty are heard.
"It ia unfortunate that the Republicans
cannot restrict their argument to the line
that a higher tariff would increase wages.
a} V- c tbis may innuen^ e some votes for
McKinley, it must repel sound-rr.oney
Democrats who consider present duties
high enough. They expect no favors
from a .Republican administration and
support their candidate from patriotic
motives, so that it would be better if their
feelings were respected and this agitation
deferred until Mr. McKinley is elected.
"Aside from this faux pas'every exertion
is made by the Republican National and
State Committees, especially in those
Middle States where the brunt of the bat
tle will have to be borne. All Eastern
States will probably vote for Mr. McKin
ley. Of the Southern States, where Popu
listic doctrines preponderate, Mr. Mc-
Kinley will only secure Maryland, Dela
ware and West Virginia, perhaps Ken
tucky. On account of their interest in
silver most States on the Pacific Slope
favor Mr. Bryan.
"The most important doubtful States
are:
Illinois. with 24 electoral votes
Misssouri with 17 electoral votes
Indiana with 15 electoral votes
Michigan with 14 electoral votes
Minnesota with 9 electoral votes
Total 79
"The fiercest struggle will take place in
Illinois, largely inhabited by many Ger
mans. Governor Altgeld, a strong eilver
ite, himself a German, is popular there.
The following Middle States are con
sidered sale for Mr. McKinley: Ohio,
with 23 votes, as the mother of Republican
Presidents; Wisconsin, witn 12 votes;
lowa, with 13 votes, on account of the
large German population.
"The recent stringency of money, par
tially due to the usual demand for moving
crops, was chiefly caused by a general de
sire to hoard, engendered by uncertainty.
Mercantile and industrial interests have
already suffered in consequence. As it
will continue, and spread over the coun
try, it may become a valuable ob
ject lesson to voters. If a fear
that Bryan may be elected can create
such disturbance, what must we expect
when he becomes President? Money may
become abundant because there would be
no longer any occasion to hoard, but the
election of Bryan would cause a suspen
sion of the payment of and a premium ou
gold. 'We do not eat soup as hot as
it is cooked.' The premium could not
become large, because a majorty of the
elected members of the House of Repre
sentatives would be against free coinage,
but uncertainty would intensify the pres
ent stagnation and public opinion would
be aroused against repudiation so that
Mr. Bryan himself would be Compelled to
abandon his scheme.
" 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.' 1 remain confident Mr. McKin
ley will be elected and that once more
manufacturers will set their spindles in
motion and merchants find courage to
trade. Then the present anxiety for our
National honor will be forgotten like a
nightmare, when the incubus of a terrible
dream is removed and we see the bright
autumn sun smile again at our puzzled
faces. Louis Wixdmuller."

were made, songs were sung and prizes
for drill were awarded. The following
programme was rendered:
Instrumental selection, Miss A. Pauba;
contralto solo, Mrs. Thomas Griffin; banjo se

ence; competitive drills, Captain George
Filmer, N. G. C â (a) lor non-eomini=sioned
officer", (b) for privates; presentation of
medals to winners, by Colonel Thomas Ryan.
The stirring feature of the evening was
young Captain i). J. McCarthy's eloquent
response to Colonel O'Byrne's presenta
tion of a beautiful silk flag. The young
man waa a surprise to his friends, and he
won the applause of the audience. After
the Colonel had finished a brief presenta
tion speech the youns man arose in uni
form and aaid he felt inadequate to the
task of fitly respondine. "But we all love
that emblem of the free," he said, "and
we hope to warrant the confidence for its
care that you have in us reposed.
"Thiw is our flag and our only flag. We
pledge to it our undivided allegiance, and
if it is assailed in some dark hour of our
country's peril you may count upon the
League of the Cross to furnish sober,
patriotic and honest men for its defense
and for the upholding of the country's
honor." There was much more said in
the same strain, and the young man's
friends gave him an ovation.
Gold medals were presented to Sergeant
McCrystle and Private William Fogarty.
The evening was greatly enjoyed by all
present.

EMMA ASHLEY'S
STATE OF MIND
Her Counsel Claims She Is
Mentally Incompe
tent.
ADDRESS TO THE JURY.
Life Story of the Young Woman
Who Tried to Kill E. J.
Baldwin.
A SAD DRAMA IN REAL LIFE
She Left Her Fiance to Come to the
Aid of Hsr Suffering, Sin
ning Sister.
The story of Emma Ashley's attempt to
kill E. J. Baldwin was told and retold in
Judge Bahrs' court yesterday. Henry E.
Highton related the tale from tlie stand
point of the prosecution, wbile James L.
Crittenden and A. T. Barnett told how the
deed was attempted, as seen by friends of
the defense. In no way did any one of
the relations differ materially from the
stories published at the time and already
told on the witness-stand on Thursday.
If the case were to go to the jury to-day
there is little doubt that the defendant
would be acquitted, and as the prosecu
tion has closed, leaving the field to the de
fense, it would seem doubly sure that
"not guilty" will finally be the verdict.
The principal event yesterday was Gen
eral Friedrichs' opening address in behalf
of the defense. He bezan by telling the
prisoner's simple life-story and finished
by asking for her acquittal.
"Twenty - two years ago," said he,
"Emma Ashley was born in a little town
in Vermont. Her family is an old one,
and she can trace her lineage through a
period of 300 years. Her great-grand
lather fought for American independence
in the Revolutionary War, and her more
recent ancestors have been always promi
nent in New England affairs, and well
thought-of, law-abiding citizens.
"Emma Ashley's father died when she
was but 10 years of ase, leaving his family
in straitened circumstances. Her
mother raised the children and brought
them un in the Christian church, which
the prisoner joined when 10 years of age,
and to which she has ever since belonged.
After her mother's death she went to work
and earned her own living in her native
town, until she was informed of her sister
Lillian's illness in Boston. She at once
hastened to her side, and has since clung
to her through all.
"Lillian Ashley subsequently came to
California and entered into relations with
E. J. Baldwin, which culminated in the
sun for seduction. Miss Emma heard of
her sister's straitened circumstances
and at once came to Pasadena from the
East in order to help her. The shame of
the situation preyed upon her to such an
extent that I am sure it permanently af
fected her mind.
"She had left the man of her choice, to
whom she was engaged to be married, to
come to her Bister. Is it any wonder
â coming from her rural home, simple,
guileless, believing in the honesty of man
kino; engaged to be married to a man as
honest as herself, she finds her beloved
sister the victim of a professional seducer,
a man who has before been the target of
a girl he had betrayed â is it any wonder,
I say, that her mind was affected ?
"Then came the trial in this City and
the journey here to attend it. The sisters
were pitiably poor; so poor, indeed, that
they lived in one room and denied them
selves the necessaries of life in order that
the child might have food. To fill their

cup of misery Jo overflowing the child fell
sick.
"For two months, weak and hunsry,
her sister's shame preying on her mind,
this woman sat in court and listened, as
she believed, to perjured witnesses telling
infamous stories about her sister. Hor
ror-stricken, flic listened to tales of things
she had never dreamed of, and saw ever
before her the man whom she believed to

be the cause of all her shame and woe.
One day she sat in court all day and then
all evening. She returned to her un
happy home, only to find her charge, the
baby, so ill that its life was in danzer.
She sat up with it all night and in the
morning returned to court, only to see her
sister on the stand, bullied and threatened
by Attorney Hiehton, who tried to make
her out an" infamous woman. She heard
a terrible question asked that sister, and
then she knew uo more.
"Gentlemen, that she had a pistol we
admit. We will show when and where
she got it; but she never knew she used it
until the morning after the shot was fired,
when she awoke in the City Prison. When
informed of what she had done she
showed no emotion, made no answer, and
a moment after her voice was heard sing
ing 'Nearer, My God, to Thee.'
"Such was her condition. We shall
prove it, and we will then ask you to ren
der a verdict of acquittal."
During General Friedricbs' address the
defendant sat calm and apparently unin
terested, while he r sister. Lilian Ashley,
bowed her head on her hands and wept.

FROM TURNAGAIN ARM
The Miners Who Sailed in the
Albion Reach Here With
No Gold.
Odd Phases of Life In and About the
New Placer Camp of Sun*
rise City.
Among the arrivals here yesterday were
W. E. Flaeg, T. B. Bowers and G.W.Gib
son, of Tulare, who were members of the
famous Ducey party who went to Cooks
Inlet, Alaska, in the Albion last April to
mine for gold.
They had no gold except $5 or $6 worth
apiece, which they had bought. But
figuring the total cost of this gold they
estimated that it cost them $300 each.
Still none of them are dissatisfied. They
saw a vast expanse of country, and trav
eled in all about 6COO miles. Mr. Flagg
said:
"It is not much of a place to mine up
there. We were at Turnagain Arm on Six
Mile Creek. Therp has been alittlequaitz
struck there, but peneraily speaking it is
piacer mining. We were all prospecting
for placers.
â¢'There is only a little gold. We found
placers and we conld not get 2 cents a
pan from them, and finally they ran out en
tirely. Six of us worked twenty days,
made sluice boxes, dug and cleaned up
and all we got wag $125. It had cost us
$300 each. That section i 3 a complete
lake. *
"About three or four properties are pay
ingn g irom $5 to $50 a day to the man. Out
side of these there isn't anythine."
Mr. Bowers thought somewhat differ
ently, in that he believed the country
would yet develop a lot of big mines. He
praised the country otherwise and said it
was as good in many respects as Montana.
"The principal town where we stopped,"
he said, "was Sunrise City. There were
from 1500 to 2000 people about there this
bummer. At an election "70 votes were
r.ast. There are four stores in the place
and a great many cabins of various designs,
built by the miners.
"We were in Bitka, Juneau and other
places. In Juneau there is great prosper
ity. There has been an immense amount
of Ouiiding, and money is plentiful every
where you go. I saw one man in Juneau
wheeling his money in the streets in a
wheelbarrow, he had so much of it. But,
of coarse, this is not the regular thing."
The gentlemen will leave for their homes
in Tulare County probably to-day.
THE INSURANCE COMPACT
Some Concessions Were Made to
Messrs. Mullin and
_2lden.
A Report That Captain Magill Has
Now Kicked Over the
Traces.
One story goes in circles of fire insur
ance that worK under ti;e new compact
was begun Thursday evening at 5 o'clock.
Yesterday underwriters were perplexed
by the rumor that Captain Magill of the
Home and Phoenix had kicked over the
traces and was cut in the open field defy
ing the compact. It is said that Magill
was satisfied Wednesday evening, but that
Mr. Mulhns of the Commercial Union and
Mr. Belden of the Hartford were not satis
fied with the u non-intercour3e" provision
of the compact. They wanted it double
riveted, copper-fastened and airtight, and
so the promoters yf the agreement made
it closer to conciliate them. This conces
sion, it is rumored, was made without
Captain Magill's consent or knowledge,
and when he heard of it he decided to
withhold his approval of the compact.
Charles D. Haven of the Liverpool, Lon
don and Globe declined to discuss com
pact affairs yesterday. He said in a gen
eral way that there was absolutely noth
ing new, and indicated plainly that the
fluency of newspaper comment was the
chief obstacle in the way of successful ne
gotiation. He was kind enough to say
that the press would be informed when
the negotiations were closed.
During the paÂ«t eighteen months a vast
deal of insurance, extending over period*
of three and five years has been effected
under the reduced rates. The owner of a
residence in Oakland said that he had in
sured nis dwelling for three years for the
sum that he had formerly paid for one
year's insurance.
There has been such a deal of slashing
and undercutting that there is very little
new business in the field.
An old-time insurance man said yester
day: "The underwriters must come to
gether. It was the greatest folly in the
first place to cut each other as they did.
They have practically destroyed the profits
of the business for three years, and for
their own protection they miist form some
kiud of agreement. At 5 o'clock Thurs
day evening the compact had been signed
by all the companies which had been ex
pected to subscribe, and I cannot account
now for the report that a new complica
tion has come up."
WANTS HIS SON RELEASED.
C. C. Hill Sues to Have His Boy's
.Marriage Annulled.
Christian C. Hill, in behalf of his son,
Charles C. H. Hill, who lacks a year of
having attained his majority, yesterday
brought suit to annul the latter's marriage
to A. E. T. HilL
The minor Hill was wedded on March
10 of this year, and it is claimed in the
complaint that on July 11, 1896, it was
discovered that the young man's new
wife, wbo waa Adolphina Scheller, was
not of irreproachaDle life while a single
woman.
As the little Hill was not of age it was
necessary for him to get his father's con
sent to the marriage. Hill senior claims
that he was induced to give this consent
on the representation that the young
woman was of good character. He there
fore asks that the marriage bo annulled.
All the parties live in Oakland.

Young Manhood,
1 The period from twenty to thirty years
of age is a very momentous one to young
men. In it come all the worst of their
temptations, and in it all the effects of
their past mistakes begin to develop. If
young men pass the age of 30 without no-
ticing any sign of weakness they may feel
reasonably sure of passing through the
most of their life in the possession of ;
healthy manly vigor. If, however, any
sign of trouble is noticed before the age of
30 it denotes early decay, and if some
action toward the recovery of this wasted
power is not taken at once the trouble is
liable to develop into nervous debility and
total impotency inside of two years. The
great vital restorer,
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
is the most effective remedy for such men.
It cures all vital weasness in from one to
three months.

out the least benefit. I have worn two other |
belts, but your belt is far superior to them. It 1
has done me more (rood in two months than any
amount of medicine could. I can recommend
it to any one suffering from similar troubles.

Many persons out of health have found I
an excuse in hot weather for doing noth-

â¢'I will wait until fall," they have prom-
ised themselves.
It is now time, if ever, in thousands ol
cases, to keep that promise.
Nothing should now interfere with j
building up the weakened nerves.
Now is the time of year when rheuma-

debility and nervousness must be checked,
when bad health must be mended â if one
hopes to get well.
The natural, unchecked course of disease
is from bad to worse as the fall and winter

It is not that rheumatism, neuralgia, in-
somnia and kidney troubles are hard to j
cure â Paine's celery compound has made I
a host of sufferers wellâ but people make
themselves chronic invalids by neglecting
the first symptoms of disease.
Thousands of lives that ure now fast

prostration, sleeplessness, poor appetite,
growing; thinness and loas ot vigor and
strength in Paine's ceicry compound.
This most remarkable of all known
remedies has won the sincere approval of
the mcft progressive part of the commun-
ity. Here is a testimonial recently re-
ceived from the wife of U. S. Senator E. F.
Warren of Wyoming, whose distinguished
services for the country's best farming in-
terests are so well known :
"I was persuaded to try your Paine'B
celery compound in the curly spring when
in a very run-down condition. The duties
devolving upon the wife of an official in
public life are naturaliy very exhausting
and I was tired out and nervous when 1
commenced using the remedy. I taka
pleasure in testifying to the great benefit
I received from its use, and can truthfully
say _ that I am in almost perfect health
again. If I ever find myself running
down again I shall certainly give it
another trial and will in the meantime
recommend it to every one needing it."
It is a fact verified by the practice of the
best physicians and by thousands of per-
sonal testimonials that Paine's celery
compound makes new, purs blood, builds
up the nervous system, and cures disease
where all other remedies have failed.
Its absolute reliability is shown by its
steady employment by trained physicians
and in homes made happy by its unques-
tioned power of making people well.

CANNED SALMON.
The Cutting Packing Company's circular says
of canned salmon: 'New trade in this article is
of small proportions, thouch qnlte a volume of
movement is in evidence, caused by deliveries of
parcels sold early in the season, receipts being
amp'e from all sections.
'â The Columbia River has closed Its canneries
with the exception of one or two that will busy
themselves in packing of fall run of fish. On out
side rivers of Oregon and Puget Sound the pack
ing-houses are all busy in puttinz up the varieties
of tish that run late in the season, and, encour
a ed by patronage accorded in the past, canning
of these lower grades of salmon has increased to
such a;i extent as to cause severe competition in
galling and a very low raime of prices.
'â¢There have been smail arrivals from Alaska
with part of the new catch, and news from that
section is that the pack is a large one, and that,
coupled with the. lor this year, extraordinary out
put of British Columbia, indicates that the total
pack of cunneit sin mon will be the largest In the
history of the business.
â¢â¢The large run in the Fraser and also in the Co
lumbia River is. we judge, v direct result of the
establishment of the fish hatcherlr s,-tnd if so gives
a lair assurance of a continuance of a business
that a tew years since bid fair to be extinguished
In tnese waters. It is to be hoped that consump
tion wiii continue to increase in the same ratio
tliat it has in the la,t few years and that the end
of the canning season may see as iglu stocks as
there were a cose of the lasi. With a return of
the old time activity in the manufacturing dis
tricts of the United states all thai is being packed
will be lapidly absorbe.l."

NKW YORK. K. V., Sept. 18 -The tendency
of the stock market was upward until just near
the close, when prices rau off fructionally on
moderate sales to realize profits. The early
strength was due to thf announcement of the en
gagement of 84,000,000 gold additional for import
by Laeard Freres of this city, rumors that further
amounts astro atms; a million had been negotia ed
for and to reports of a heavy demand for ocean

movement of the mt-tal is likely to continue for

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.

price of middling uplands to B%c again, though
realizing sent It down to S%c.
Weakness in stocks was partly due to small earn
ings, st. Paul especially reporting decrease, and
all reports for September thus far decrease 1.6 per
cent from last year ana 13.1 from 1892, re urns
being less favorable for the second than for the
first week. The west-bound movement is light,
especially in dry goods and shoes, but east-bound
tonnage from Chicago has been as large as last
year and 4 per cent larger than in 1892.
The one Industry showing increase of working
force is the co.ton manufacture, restriction of out- :
put having secured more healthy demand for
some goods. Most of the mills have started or are
about to start, though the uncertainty of the cot
ton market embarrasses prices. Prices of staple
goods have advanced so generally that the aver
age of representative quotations is 6.7 percent
higher than in the first week of August. No such
improvement is se n in woolens, but the specula
tive buying of wool, nearly all at Boston, has
raised sales to 17,775.300 pounds for the past
three weeks agilnst 17,133,470 last year and
24,572,400 in 1892.
The iron and steel manufacture is still wanting
for business, with nearly half its producing ca
pacity idle, but hopefulness and the speculative
buying cf pigiron sustain prices. -â¢ â â .
bales said to amount to 25,000 tons have been
made of Alabama Iron for shipment to England,
but the home demand does not enlarge at all, and
the various associations still hold combination
prices, though the demand is remarkably slender.
Gold Imports continue, over $5,000,000 having
been ordered, making 536.385.000 in all, of which
324,890,000 has arrived. The interior movement
draws off I the money about as fast, as It comes,
$4,650,000 having gone westward this week. The
New Orleans difficulties have passed, but the
Northwest is man lug large drafts. Recent heavy
failures increase the caution of banks, and
while more commercial paper is offered the ruling
rate of 8 per cent greatly retards Increase in busi
ness. Failures for the past week have been 317 In
the United States, against 213 last year, and 32 in
Canada, against 32 last year.

necessary for immediate use. Generally speaking

are : easier. Choice washed Guatemalas are en-,
tirely exhausted. The best quality obtainable.

at full figures, and the supply of shipping styles Is

overland shipment with sales of 31Â» bags within
the range of our - quotations. The inauguration
since our last issue of tare allowance on all Coffees
sold in this market has added nominally but not
actually to the price of this description, and some â

NECESSITIES OF
PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Councilman Manuel Advo
cates a Cut in the
Present Cost.
DIRECTOR REED OPPOSES
He Asserts That the Council Has
Lost Some of Its Former
Pride.
FIGURES THAT ARE DENIED.
The Ordinance Goes to Print and the
Matter Will Next Go to the
Mayor.
Oaklakd Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sej t. 16. t
The annual disagreement over the city
tax levy is in progress, and the only dif
ference bet we n it and former struggles is
that this year it i> a little more torrid than
usual. As the levy touches everybody's
pocket everybody is interested in it, and
as Mayor Davie is silent and refuses to
commit himself taxpayers are guessing.
The great bone of contention at this
time is the Board of Education. The City
Council has determined to make some cuts,
and the Board of Education is equally de
termined not to accept anything less than
the Auditor's figures.
There is more friction this year between
the two boards than usual, and there does
not appear to be any hope of harmony, be
cause each body has made up its mind and
refuses to be moved.
The two bodies are trying to come to
gether, but at the conference each refuses
to bud c a particle.
President Mott of the City Council has
prepared some figures which he declares
are practicable and which would not in
the least impair the efficiency of the
schools.
When Chairman Reed of the High
School Board asked President Mott Tor
his figures he pro Â»uce*l the following:
Apparatus, Â§100; fuel, $500; gas and power,
$500; keeping horÂ»e aad buggy hire, $225;
manual training-scnool fittings, $1500; im
pr veinent of buildings, $2000; repair of
buildings, $100; salary oi superintendent,
$500; stationery and supplies, $100; expense
of taking school census, .ftiUO; paints and oils,
$500; supplies manual-training school, $500.
Mr. Reed defended the school board and
said: "In times past the Council was proud
of the public schools and dealt liberally
with them, but thi3 is no lorlfcer the case.
In the month of June we calculate our ex
penses, hire teach- rs and make our con
tracts, and in October the Council tries to
Aake a big cut. It looks very much as
though this Council were trying to :erce
us to cut down our teachers' salaries.
There is no other way in which the schools
can be run inside of the amount fixed by
you. I have been tola that the object of
these reducttons in salaries and expenses
is to enabie the Council to purchase a
piece of land io be used as a park. If a
park is needed I would suggest that you

in Berkeley are on the boom. ' To-morrow
the Republican primaries for the choosing
of delegates to the county convention will
be held. The wind has been blowing
strong tor the last week in favor of Strat
ton for the Senate and William Lair Hill
for Superior Judge. In fact the students
at the University seem almost unanimous
in favor of Stratton since he has pledged
himself to work for the interests of the
institution. The Students' Republican 1

voted upon, the others having been forced
to withdraw because of the strong tide in
Stratum's favor.
William Lair Hill is a resident of the
college town and his name appears on
. both tickets. The "McKinley League"
ticket is headed by Straiton and Hill,
while the "Republican Club's" ticket has
the name of Hill at the head.

OAKLAifP Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 18. j
Mrs. Pratt, the matron of the We9t Oak
land Home, has received a letter in which
she is asked to look out for a man with
two children who is traveling through
trie Siate and who may be shortly be in
Oakland. The case has been referred to
Mrs. Prescott of the Childrens' Society
and she is anxious that any une who sees
the father and children will at once cause
his arrest and communicate with her.
The little boy and eirl have been trained
by the man to fight in public. He takes
them into barrooms and such places and
makes them box, and pockets tb- pro
ceeds. Their story is told in the follow
ing extract from the letter which was
written from Hornbrook in Siskiyou
County:
"I want to tell you about a man who is
passing through this vicinity with two
little children, a boy and a jweet little
girl. He let them lay on the front porch
all night, and wtien we told him to put

and said that the man whipped them, and
that th*Â»y frequently had no place to

REV. DR. BENTLEY.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 18.â Rev. Dr. Robert Bentley, pastor of the Tnnitv
Methodist Church of Berkeley, believes he is in possession ot the most probable of all
theories yet advanced as to the origin of the American Hag. and the causes which led
Washington to recommend the stars and stripes as tha National emblem. It was dur
ing his recent European tour that Dr. bentley becamo po-se-.sed of this most interest
ing bit of iniorruation. "While I was in Cambridge, Enzland," said he this after
noon, "one of the first places of historical interest that I visited was the college in
which Milton was a student. Having been shown by the registrar the entry of the
â¢blind poet's' name on the record-boolcs, our party was taken to the Church of St,
Mary's the Less, where we were Bhown a stone tablet dedicated to the memory of thÂ«
Washington family. The tablet was suspended on the wall and was about 20 inches
long by 14 inches wide. On it were carved an eagle and a shield. I was at once struck
with the similarity between it and our own emblem. Looking closer, I saw that the
eagle, was sitting in a nest surrounded by a crown, and under the- eaglo was the
shield. On the shield were two bars and three stars. The tablet had on it also
â¢Sacred to Corydon Washington, rector of the church, who died in 1725.' The direct
relationship between thÂ« families of Corydon and George Washington has been traced,
and judging from the circumstances surrounding this tablet I am led to believe that it
was the coat-of-arms of the early Washing tons. It seems most probable to me that
the first ideas regarding a National emblem cams to the 'father of His Country'
from this very tablet.
"In the Church in Minores, in London, I saw another tablet sacred to the memory
of the Washington family. This had carved on its shield the stars and stripes but no
eagle. The sight of these two historic slabs and the inscriptions on them made such
a profound impression on my mind thati began to study the origin of the flag, but 1
can find no theory bearing on the question which seems more reasonably certain of
being the true on: than this."

protect herself. In any case the man took
the money."
Mrs Prescott is very anxious to locate
this man and the little children. There is
a suspicion that he is not their father and
that the little ones may have oeen kid

OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 18.â The resi
dence of Mrs. Remi Chabot, on Madison
and Eleventh streets, was entered last
night by burglars, and Lee C. Burnham,
who was in charge, is short a gold watch

stick on the parlor mantel to light them
selves around with.
Mrs. Chabot and daughters are at

Colored Porter's Charge.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 18.â A stir was
created in the Police Court to-day when
I E. H. Parker, the colored porter charged
j with beating his wife, stated to Justice
Wood that he had been told that W. J.
Oglesby, the colored attorney, was trying j
to railroad him to jail. O^iesby was pres

serted that there had been a misunder

MOUNT EDEN'S GREAT DAT.
The McKinley Wigwam to Be For*
maily Opened With Oratory, Bar
becne and Ball.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 18. J
The Republicans who vote at the county
primary to-morrow cannot record their
ballots in a hurry. Never before has there
been such complications among candi
dates for nominations, and now at the last
moment it is thought that some names, at
present mentioned in whispers, will be
placed before the convention as the only
method of obtaining enough votes to
nominate.
Although there are. so many people
seeking office before the primary there
will not be nearly so many names placed
before the convention. It generally costs
about $10 to place a name in nomination
and this is a large sum in cash for many
of those who are after the nominations.
No new complications presented them
selves to-day; indeed, it would be difficult
to tanele things up more than they are at
present, and even after the result of the
primaries is known to-morrow night it
will not be much less intricate. It will be
easy to see when the polls close whether
Stratton or Derrick has won the Sena
torial fight. The Judges, Supervisors and
some of the Assemblymen must remain in
doubt until the choice of Monday's con
vention is made known.
The convention will be called to order
at 10 o'clock Monday at Linderman Opera
house in Alameda.
THE DEMOCRATS.
County Convention Will Meat In
the Tabernacle and Name a
TlcKet.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 18.â The Demo
cratic County Convention will be called to
order on Saturday morning at 10 o'clock,
in the Tabernacle. There wiil be 144 dele
gates, and it is expected that many of
these will be represented by proxy.
M. J. Layruance, chairman of the
County Central Committee, will call the
meeting to order, and it is generally
thought that M. F. Tarpey will oe agree
able to both sections of the party for per
manent chairman.
The great point of interest will bÂ« the
report of the fusion committee, and it is
expected that it will create a heated argu
ment find may not be accepted in its
entirety. Should this expectation prove
true, the members of the committee will
have to meet again and try to bring about
ultimate harmony.
THE POPULISTS.
They Will Also Hold Their Conven-
tion and Hear the Fusion
Report.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 18.â The Popu
lists will hold their county convention to
morrow in Germania Hall. The first
matter of importance will be the reading
of tne report on the Democrat-Populist
fusion committee. This is certain to
create a storm, for there are some rabid
middle-of-the-road men in the convention,
and their voices will surely be heard, for
they have said so beioreband. There
seems to be little doubt, though, that the
fusion report will be acceptable to the ma
jority. It provides for an equal distribu
tion of the offices, and there art several
candidates for some of the nominations.
After the news hao been received at
both conventions that each has accepted
the tusion report the rest will be all smooth
â ailing.
MOUNT EDEN WIGWAM.
Will Be Dedicated With a Bar-
becue, Oratory and

OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 18.â The Mount
Eden McKinley and Hobart Wigwam will

speakers are Congressman Hllborn, C. M.
B'iortridge, W. R. Davis and Rev. Anna
Shaw.
Two beeves have been prepared for the
barbecue, which will be held at sp. m.,
and there will be everything to insure a
grand time.
At nigtit there will be a grand ball and
a display of fireworks. All the surround
ing country is interested in the event, and
the Republican campaign will be given a
great boom in that part of the county.

EQUAL SUFFR AGE THE FAD
Increasing Popularity of the
Movement lor the New
Regime.
Religious Bod:es S and By the Women
of California in Peeking the
Ballot
Woman suffrage seems to have become
quite the correct thing, and many promi
nent society folkj have taken it up and
are laboring for it heart and soul. The la
dies are by no means alone in tbeir fight,
for a number of well-fenown gentlemen are
making a quiet but effective campaign
among their friends, securing what the
women need most of all â votes.
In religious circles also the movement
has met with hearty indorsement. The
Christian Ministers' Association set the
ecclesiastical ball a-rolling at their con
vention in Santa Cruz last month, unani
mously adopting a strong resolution in
lavor of woman suffrage.
A little later the Baptists at their annual
convention passed a similar resolution
without a dissenting vote, and now come
the Methodists, who passed the following
resolution at the conference in Pacific
Grove on the lite inst :
Whereas, We are taught In the Word of God
that man was created male ana female after
his own image and given dominion over all
the creatures of the earth, and believing thfct
there is no sex in souls, in duties or in God,
and that under the cardinal doctrines of our
country all men should be free and equal,
that alt who bear the burdens of our Govern
ment should share equally all civil, political
and reiigious rrgnts and privileges; and
â¢wherens, by a decision of the United States
Supreme court women have been declared
citizens and can become full citizens ot our
own State by amending the constitution so as
to drop the word "male" and substitute the
word "person," as provided for in amend
ment 6. which Is to be submitted to the voters
of the State at the election of November 3:
Ketolved, That we the members of the Cali
fornia Conference Lay Association of the
Methodist Episcopal church, in annual con
vention assembled, welcome the proposed
amendment as an advanced step in the
progress of the world along the lines
of justice, equity and purity, and com
mending the wisdom and patriotism of the
came we hereby pledge ourselves as individ
uals to support the principles therein.
All over the State demands are being
made for speakers. The determined stand
for political equality taken by the Repub
licans of Los Angeles has given a great
impetus to the work in Southern Califor
nia, where the woman suffragists expect a
large majority.

THIS EARTH AS
A HOLLOW SHELL
And the Sun as Moving
About in Its In
terior.
PLANETS AS A MYTH
And Only Rf flections of Disks
Which Are in Earth's
Shell.
DR. TEED'S STRANGE IDEAS.
Concavity of the Surface of Water
Has Been Demonstrated by
Novel Apparatus.
"The diameter of the sun is about 500
miles. It is situated exactly in the center
of the earth, which is a hollow globe,
having a diameter of 8000 miles. The eun
travels baclc and forth, north and south,
from the equator and the earth does not
Apparatus Which, According to Dr. Teed, Demonstrates That the
Earth Is Concave.
move except that it turns around on its !
axis once in about 24,000 years. The sun
has cne dark face and one light face.
When ws see the light face it is day and
when we see the darK side it is night.
The Copernican system of astronomy is
played out and no good.
"T. c earth has a shell composed of i
strata, which are arranged in the order of
their specific gravity, a layer of gold being
on the outside and a layer of silver next !
inside.
"In the laminations of these strata I
there are disks which travel. There are no j
planets. What we suppose to be planefs
are reflections of these disks traveling in ,
the laminations. The earth is the only
planet in existence. There are stars, but
they are only reflections from the central i
star and are really focalizations of ener- j
gies. There are records of over 150
.eclipses when the sun, moon and earth
were out of line, ana no astronomer can
offer auy explanation of this fact. The
moon is only the localization of all the
energies oi the earth and is not an actual
body.
"The moons of Saturn are subsidiary
disks circulating around the larger disks
in the laminations of the earth's shell.
The shell of the earth I have determined
to be only 100 miles thick. The earth is
concave and we have fifieen methods of
proving it. It is true that modern as
tronomers predict eclipses. Our system
is really the reverse of theirs. They base
their observations on a convex surface
and their lines radiate. In our system,
based on the discovered fact that the
earth is hollow and that we are on the in
side of it, the lines converge. The result
is the same, but the astronomers are all
mistaken concerning distances. The sun
is really only 4000 miles distant and it is j
exactly in the center of the earth.
'â¢In the shell of the earth are seven pri
mary metallic substances. The location
of the gold I have determined by taking i
oxygen as the zero point and water as a
ratio. Specific gravity also determines
that gold will r'ach the point where it j
will weigh nothing or be static. The dis
tance between the water and the gold can !
be determined by this law, and it is ICO >
miles. That gives one the thickness of I
the crust of the earth.
"The essences of the earth flow to a i
distance oi 4000 miles to the astral center. \
These forces f:ive us that great electric light
which we know as the sun, and which
contains all the energies of gold, silver, j
copper, etc. The astronomers are mis- I
taken concerning their theory that flames
from the sun shoot out to a distance of !
100,000 miles. In fact, they are mistaken i
all around. All my assertions I can demon- i
strate are true irom the Bible, which says J
that the sun, moon and stars are set in the !
earth's firmament.
'â¢The word comet is derived from a word
which means hair. Comets are the pro
duction of the relations of the collines,
which are the prime meridians. The
comet is simply a "dock tail.' What ap
pears to be the tail of a comet is simply
radiation from the sun. That is all there
is to it. We determine the distance of the
sun by the laws oi correspondences and
distances."
So talked Dr. Cyrus R. Teed at his lodg
ings on Bryant street yesterday. As he
developed the details of his system he
said that he would like to discuss his the
ories and discoveries with theologians,
scientists and all-comers.
"But how," it was asked, "will you
demonstrate to the common man that the
earth is concave and not convex, as is
taugut?"
â¢â¢Well," said Dr. Teed, "according to
the Encyclopedia Britannica, the amount
of curvature or divergence of the eart/h's
surlace from the vertical is 8 inches for
one mile. 32 inches for the second mile, 72
inches for the third mile, and soon. That
is the accepted theory of the scientists of
the old school. The fact is, however, that
a ship sixty miles at sea can be seen with
the aid of a telescope. The acknowledged
fact that the ship does disappear to the
unaided eye, although this is one of the
favorite arguments employed to demon
strate the convexity of the earth's sur
face, has no truth if the telescope does
what I claim for it. The disappearance of
the ship is due to foreshortening.
"Let me give you an illustration. If you
stood in the center of a perfectly level
plain on a tower 100 feet high the first
mile spread out around you would seem
to occupy considerable space. The second
mile would occupy less and so on until
your vision would find a point where all
distances would seem to blend. But we
sire not compelled to reÂ«t with theories.
We have demonstrated at Chicago on the
surface of perfectly smootu water that the
earth is concave and not convex. Our ap
paratus ia simple and mathematically ex
act. It consists of perpendicular posts,
rising four feet above the level of the
water, their perpendicularity being estab
lished by plumb lines; then to the up
rights are attached rails at right angles to
the perpendiculars, and in one mile there
is not a deviation ot 1-16,000 of an inch
from mathematical accuracy. \^ith such
an apparatus we can follow out a straight
line live or six miles, and have done this,
and we find that the line aipa into the
water at both ends, if tne earth were cou
vei all water in equilibration would con
form to this ratio of convexity. We have
demonstrated that the water is not con
vex. Here is a picture of our apparatus
if you wish it."
The cut shows the plan pursued by Dr.
Teed to demonstrate that the earth is
hollow and that we are all "in it."
HAS BEEN , WICK DIVORCED.
Gare Her Husband Two Chances, But He
Wmi Id Not Reform.
Sierra N. Watson was yesterday granted
a divorce from James W. Watson, a travel
ing salesman for a wholesale linen estab
lishment.
The marital troubles of the pair have
been aired in the courts several times.
Mrs. Watson secured a divorce once be
fore because of her husband's habitual in
temperance, but on his promise to reform
and after he had taken the gold care the
parties were remarried. Durine the pres
ent trial it was testified that the defendant
only kept his promise for a few mouths,
when he relapsed into his old habits.
While the first suit was pending Watson
speut some time in th<* County Jail be
cause of his refusal to obey an order of
Judge Hebbard as to alimony.
The parties were married in San Luis
Obisoo in 1879 and l.aye two children, the
custody of whom was- awarded to the
mother. Judge Hebbard also ordered
that Watson pay his wife $75 Der month
alimony and $250 counsel fees.
Some property in Cayugas, which Mrs.
Watson deeded to her husband, ia also
in controversy.
GRAIN RATES FROM FRESNO.
The Valley Boad'i Tariff Met by the
Southern Pacific.
Grain rates from Fresno to tidewater
points were issued yesterday by the Val
ley road and were immediately met by the
Southern Pacific Company. The rate
fixed by the new competing road from the
Bel mont-a venue switch at Fresno to
Stockton is $2 15 per ton in carload lots of
not less than 24,000 pounds, and $2 65 per
ton from Fresno to San Francisco, Port
Costa, Crocketts and Benicia.
The $2 15 rate put in by the Southern
Pacific applies not only from Fresno to 1
Stockton, but also from Herndon, Musca- I
tel, Collis, Rolinda and Pratton. The
rate of $2 65, made by the Southern Pacific,
applies from Fresno, Herndcn, Muscatel,
Mendota, Whites Bridge, Jameson, Collis,
Kohnda and Pratton to Nevada Dock,
Port Costa, Crocketts, Benicia and South
Vallejo, and a rate of $3 15 is made by the
same company from the valley points
just named to San Francisco and Oak
land.
The former rates of the Southern Pa
cific were: From Fresno to Stockton^
$2 35; to Port Costa, etc., $3; to San Fran
cisco and Oakland. $3 50.
It is expected thru class rates to and
from Fresno will be issued in about a
week.
SLEEK CONFIDENCE MEN,
J. T. McKay, and J. W. Ash
Wanted for Getting Money
From Hotels.
The Palace Is Watched for Them.
'Experiences at Colorado Springs
and Denver.
Detectives John Seymour and Ross
Whitaner were at the Palace Hotel last
night, waiting for some hours for the re
turn oi J. W. Ash, who is said to be a
very smooth young man with several
aliases, who has been beating different ho
tels of the country.
Ash, according to the story, had a
traveling partner, who has been operating
for a part of the time under the name of
J. T. McKay. The latter stopped at the
Occidental for a brief time, but appears to
have grown apprensive of arrest, for it is
said he left the (My Tuesdey. A request
has been sent here that they be arrested
for obtaining money under false pretenses.
It seems that these men, both of whom
are well-dressed and of suave manners,
were at the Antlers Hotel in Colorado
Springs from September 5 to September
11. Two young women were with them,
who passed as thÂ»Â»ir wives. The men left
the hotel and went to Denver, there ap
prising the women that they would return
the next day.
They did not put in an appearance, and
about this time it developed that they
had feathered their nests in one way and
another to the extent of several hundred
dollars. At Colorado Springs the men
were said to have registered as J. T.
McKay and J. W. Ash.
Further investigation brought out the
story that they had left Kansas City on
September 1, and registered at the Brown
Palace Ho'el an A. W. Mann and wife,
Boston, and H. W. Gordon and wife, A;i
zonn. It i-< said they also announced at
one time that they were stock men of Fort
Worth, Tex.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
THE LIQUOR INTEREST.
Legislation Hostile to the Flow
ing Bowl Will, Be Guarded
Against.
Candidates Will Be Interviewed as to
Their Fee. ins; on an Impor
tant Matter.
Delegates representing; the liquor interests
of California held a meeting last night iv the
assembly-room of the Mills building for the
purpose of considering ways and means of
protecting the business from hostile legisla
tion.
Each society sent three delegates. The so
cieties are:
The California State Protective Association,
representing sixty-five wholesale liquor firms
in this City and about 7000 retailers through
out the State.
The Brewers' Protective Association, made
up of all the brewers in this City, Sacramento
and Oakland.
Branch No. 2of the California State Protec
tive Association, the retail organization of
this State.
German Saloon-keepers' Association.
German Retail Grocers' Association.
Retail Grocers' Union.
This convention last night decided to form
a permanent campaign committee, consisting
of three delegates from each of those associa
tions, to look after the interests of the liquor
trade during the coming campaign.
The following permanent officers were elect
ed: James P. Edoff, chairman; John C. Nob
mann, vice-chairman; William T. O'Brien,
secretary; D. B. Faktor, treasurer.
There are about 12,000 retail liquor-dealers
in the State of California, about 4000 of
whom are in San Francisco.
The committee will take an active Interest
in the coming election, and will devote its
entire attention to the candidates for the
Supervisorship and for the Legislature. The
liquor men are in politics on a business basis,
and will support only those candidates who
will assure them that they will not attempt to
legislate against the liquor Interests in this
State.

ENGLISH PRISONS
IRISH WRECKS
An Indignation Meeting of
Representative Irish-
Americans.
DYNAMITE AND TORTURE
The British Government De
nounced for Barbarous
Methods.
THREATS THAT MEAN BLOOD.
Judge Cooney and Thomas Bannerman
Say That Talk Must Give
Way to Deeds.
Tory ears would tingle had they been
present last night to hear the opinions of
Irish- American citizens expressed in un
mistakable language in Knights of the
Red Branch Hall. Those opinions were
not directed against England and the
English people, but against the British
Government, which threw upon the shores
of America Dr. Gallagher and other polit
ical prisoners wrecked in body and driven
insane by barbaric cruelty.
Such was the story that was recited last
night by earnest Irishmen, wuose indigna
tion voiced itself in the plainest and most
direct Saxon.
Dr. M. C. O'Toole called the
meeting to order and spoke of a
proposition to call a public meeting for
the purpose of collecting funds for the re
lief of the amnested prisoners.
R. C. O'Connor opposed any appeal to
others outride of tbe Irish race.
"The Irish people could always do pretty
handsomely on occasions of that kind.
England to-day holds up her hands in
holy horror wneu anything approaching
a stick of dynamite or a of giant
powder is found in possession of an irish
man, wherever he may reside, and the
charge is made that he is engaged in a
conspiracy to blow the British empire to the
place where we wouid all like to ace it go,"
added Mr. O'Connor.
Tbe speaker went on to teli about the
barbarous manner in which the English
Government had always treated Irish po
litical prisoners in particular ana the
Irish people generally. There was noth
ing, he said, but a trail of Dlood between
the two countries which had grown redder
and redder during two centuries of perse
cution.
It made the heart sick to think of the
outrages on Irishmen by England in days
gone by, and it was not to be wondered at
wnen the Irishman, in the bitterness of
his heart, took the only means of reveng
ing h mseif tnat civilization and the in
ventive genius of thf age afforded him.
Mr. O'Connor spoke of the bombard
ment oi Alexandria in Egypt only a few
years ago, and the bombardment of Zan
zibar quite recently.
"She is t;.e bully of nations," continued
he, "when sne rinds one that cannot strike
back. What matters it whether it is with
dynamite or with a cannon ball that she
destroys her foes? She had lately refined
her cruelt.v, and not satisfied with wreck
ing the body, had wrecked the minds of
her political prisoners.
"Those who were released from her
prisons the other day, after years of suf
fering and of torture, were broken in mind
as well as in body and sent adriit into th*
world with their intellects impaired by a
system of barbaric and hellish torture.
''These poor men are totally unable to
take care of themselves and I am sure tbe
generous impulses characteristic of the
Irish people will respond to their aid. I
think that au appeal to the Irish societies
of this City and State will be rewarded
with a handsome sum. lam not in favor
of appealing to others."
General P. F. Walsh responded to a call
foz a speech, in whicn he said that no one
questioned that it was the duty of Irish
men to extend relief to those victims of
English imprisonment who for thirteen
years had been subject to tortures which
had resulted in breaking down the health
of all and wrecking the intellect of two.
"It is sad to think," he added, "that in
a cause that has ennobled men in other
lands the iron despotism of England metes
out the most, inhuman punishment to Ire
laud, in days gone by, wher. the sword
and the torch and the dungeon and the
scaffold were resorted to, those punish
ments â the sword of Cromwell and the
scaffolds of 1798â were more humane than
the hellish punishments in England's
prisons to-day.
"I do not tnink anything can be gained
by a public expression on those subjects.
We have appealed and appealed and pro
tested and protested against this barbarity,
yet it is still carried out."
The general closed by advising active
measures of relief.
Jeremiaji Mahoney â not the Senator of
the same name-^made a brief but eloquent
speech. He said that as the soldiers of
the people were the wards of the Nation,
these prisoners whose only crime nad been
their unsurpassed devotion to their coun
try â those mental and physical wrecks â
should be tbe wards of the Irish people,
who should take pride in seeing that for
the future they snouid want for nothing.
He was opposed to holding a public
meeting, because the time was not oppor
tune to get up resolutions denouncing
England. "God knows we have done that
long enough. There are otber prisoners
still there, suffering just as badly as those
men who foi some unaccountable reason
at this time were given their freedom.'-
Judge Robert Ferral followed in a
speech denouncing the British Govern
ment, and saying that the whole civilized
world should rise up and in the name of
civilization -hould protest against it.
Judge M. Cooney's remarks were to the
effect that the time for speechmaking by
patriotic Irishmen had gone by and that
the time for action had come. The only
effective speeches were of tbe kind made

ear - liuw to Care tttrj Uumor," milled free.
by a man in Eurot^e a day or two ago as
follows: "Ii you don't release Tynan you
will â " Here the man's speech broke off,
but the stop was significant. He added:
"If yon allow him to be extradited into
England wrongfully and unlawfully then
take the consequences."
"Irishmen must learn to talk like that
German, or whoever he was," continued
the Judge. "Work is what you want and
a determined warring to those people
that if they don't release those prisoners
something may drop, and I don't care a
continental what drops."
This warlike declaration of the speaker
was greeted with cheers.
James C. Neaion suggested that a pub
lic indignation meeting might do some
good in letting the Irish people know all
over the world that their countrymen and
and country-women in San Francisco
were up and doing; but he was not sure
whether that would be enough to justify a
public meeting.
The public meetings of the past had ac
complished but little good. At present
money was needed, and not speech
maki.'ig. He suggested that there should
be no delay in extending tbe needed aid,
and that the chair should appoint one
person for every Irish society in the State
to form an executive committee.
Thomas Bannerman spoke of what he
called "the infamous, tbe awful hypocrisy
of England, who, through Lord Russell,
bad deprecated the horrors of war and
suggested arbitration."
Gladstone came in for a slap. The
speaker said that tbe "grand old man"
whose heart was now bleeding for the
Armenians, had not lifted a finger during
the last ten years to alleviate the suffer
ings of tbe tortured political prisoners in
English dungeons.
Mr. Bannerman contrasted the easy
prison life of Dr. Jamieson with that of
Irish prisoners. "Yet Jamieson," said
the speak.-r, "went in with a band of ruf
fians to invade tbe homes of a peaceful
and industrious people, who had made the
African desert blossom as the rose. This
dog, this infamous fellow is well treated
in prison.
"It is time to stop talking. We have
become ridiculous in the eyes of tbe world
because of too much talking. We are a
nation of talkers. Let us talk no more.
This Irisn whine has been going on too
long. I feel that I owe an apology to my
country for taking any active part at all in
Irish politics."
Mr. Bannerman concluded by saying
that he had met Charles Stewart Parneli
in New York City, and found him to be a
unique character and a man well quali
fied to inspire confidence. He had fol
lowed Parnell during his life time, "and
Parneli was crushed by the Irish people
at the dictation of an Englishman."
Secretary Stafford, read a communica
tion from M. P. O'Connor advising that
the facts of the late dynamite scare be in
vestigated, and the alleged discovery of a
diabolical plot by Irishmen to murder the
Queen of England and to commit other
norrible and meaningless atrocities with
the object of showing the nature and pur
pose of the so-called dynamite plot, so
that the Irish revolutionists mi^ht beset
ri>rht before the American people.
The writer was convinced that when the
true history of the matter became known
it would be found that the plot was
hatched in Scotland Yard and not in the
brain of P. J. Tynan. The thing smelled
too strongly of Guy Fawkes, in the
writer's opinion, and was lacking in the
meritorious quality of originality.
"While 1 cannot characterize too
strongly the man who would sacrifice the
lives of human beings not engaged in
warfare I would say that in comparison
with England's cruel treatment of her
political prisoners the deed of tne dyna
miter becomes a meritorious act."
The chair was authorized to appoint an
executive committee of fifteen at large
and one from each Irish society in this
State.
The meeting adjourned until next
Thursday evening.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1896.
EXPERTS ARE ON
THE MOTHER LODE
They Are High-Priced Men,
and of World-Wide
Experience.
MOVING MYSTERIOUSLY
Some Belief That a Large Deal
in Minos May Be Under
Consideration.
MANY SAMPLES ARE ASSAYED.
It Is Reported That Mr. Wiltsee, Late
of the Rand, Gets the Most of
the Returns.
The keen eyes of those who know about
mines and men prominently connected
with tbe initiation of large mining enter
prises in various parts of the world have
recently been directed with curious inter
est to the somewhat mysterious move
ments of mining experts from abroad, who
seem to be engaged i:: the exploration of
the mother lode in this State. Not less
than a score of representatives of Euro
pean capital have been on the mother lode
during the past two or three months, sci
entifically prospecting and sending ore to
this City to be assayed, and receiving
reports to be forwarded to London
and other centers of capital in Europe.
These men are high priced and sal
aried. One of them is Known to have
drawn Â£5000 salary in Australia some
years ago, an^.l his price has been consider
ably advanced since then. Tbe others are
well known in various parts of the earth.
Intelligent onlookers have no doubt that
the mother lode is being considered as
carefully abroad as the Rand in South
Africa or ttie Coolgardie fields ever were.
From the appearance here of these ex
perts it is assumed, and witn a likeli
hood of sounJ reason, that the mother
lode is considered by foreigners to be a
fine field for exploitation, the advantages
of climate and all other natural aius to
uninterrupted mining having helped to
secure it favorable notice. One thing is
sure, wnich is that the expense of keeping
these men in the fi Id is large. None oi
them work for small pay, and the inci
dental expenses are heavy. Such expense
and trouble would be unwarrantable from a
busine.-s point of view, if tne expectation
of making large investments were not en
tertained. Tins has led to the supposition,
which is entertained by intelligent min
ing men, that a deal of some size in min
ing properties on the mother lode is not
improbable. Ttiat such deal lias already
been made is denied by deaiers in mines
in this City.
Who may be represented by the experts
who have been in the field is. of course, a
subject for guesses mure or less shrewd.
Mr. lrelan thinks that some of them may
represent private parties with capital of
$1,000 000, out be has no knowledge that
any large mining syndicates have sent
their representatives here. Mr. Wiltsee,
who has recently returned from the Rand
mining region in South Ainca, said yes
terday thai he did not know that there is
anything unusual in tue situation, and
was not aware that any large deal is in
view. Rumor has it that the ore samples
sent down by tue experts on tbe mother
lode for assaying are known to him by
reports of which he receives the majority
at least. Mr. Wiitsee was asked about
this, but answered only that he receives
reports of ores from all over the world.
Ht does not know who may be exploiting
on the mother lode, tut two mining
friends of bis from London have been up
there recently.
Tbe report is about that some of the
better-known experts have chosen to go to
the smaller hotels and Dave succeeded in
evading notoriety. Tneir acts indicated
that they did not desire publicity. Among
the experts who have been here are men
tioned the names ot Gilmore, Irowbridge,
Sydney Barnett, Pa^coe and MacNaugn
ton, and the estimated number of those
who have been recently on the mo. her
lode varies from a uozen to twenty-five.
The men who are named above are all
weii-salaried men, ana most of them have
grown up under John Taylor & Sons of
London. They are supposed to be scat
tered over the southern end of the mother
lode. Tbey are not mspec iDg any mine
or group of mines. It is reported that one
assaying office in this City is making from
twenty to tuirty assays and that the re
turns are all made to Mr. Wiltsue. The
young men now in the State have been
connected with the exploitation of the
Rand and West Australia, and also were
at Cripple Creek and the White Oaks and
Black Mountain in New Mexico.

A CAMSRA STOLEN.
Bold Theft From a Wenlern Addition
Photographer.
A photographer, whose business is mak
ing pictures of houses for a downtown
company, had his camera stolen yesterday
afternoon. He had just finished taking a
photograph of the residence of Charles H.
Phillips, 1620 Fell street, when his camera
and tripod were stolen.
"The photographer, whose nsmi I do
not know," said Mr. Phillips yesterday,
"had just finished the snap at tbe house
and bad stepped in to con-ult about the
finish when the thief appeared. By the
time the owner of the instrument appeared
the thief had escaped with the instrument
and its appurtenances. They were worth
$100."

SUTRO IN FAVOR
OF BIMETALLISM
The Mayor Has Stndied
the Subject for Many
Years.
OF WORLD-WIDE MOMENT
Wrote a Pamphlet on the Sub
ject More Than Thirty
Years Ago.
ENGLAND MUST BE BROUGHT IN
Bimetallism the Only Policy Under
Which the Commercial Worid
Can Prosper.
Mayor Sutro has announced that he will
take an active part in the coming cam
paign in the interest of sound money, and
that be will publish an address on the sub*
ject in the near future.
As long ago as 1866 the Mayor published
an exhaustive pamphlet in relation to
bimetallism, and says that the conditions
and the necessity for sound money are
practically the same now as they were
then.
"I was pondering over tbls question
about as long ago as any other man in this
country," saia Mr- Butro yesterday, "and
I think I know more about it than most
men. It is a very difficult question, that
not one man in a thousand fully under
stands, yet it is very simple if it is put
simply.
"I am a bimetallism I believe that much
of the prosperity of the world would come
from the restoration of bimetallism. Eng
land is a gold country because she is in
the hands of the money kings. The Eng
lish bankers and money lenders naturally
prefer the single standard. They profit
by lending money ana the greater its pur
chasing power the greater the benefit to
them.
"But the English voters are bimetallists
and if tbey had a chance to express their
sincere opinion the country would be
bimetallic. If I had enough money I
could bring England around to bimetal
lism within a year by circulating tbe
proner kind of literature among the voters.
"England must be broueht in, and the
bimetallists of this country must do it.
The money question is not merely nation
al. It concerns tbe whole world. Money
is in the hands of one nation to-day, in
the hands of another to-morrow. It is
absurd to think that a nation can stand
alone in its financial policy. Money has
to circulate between the different countries
of the world, and without international
agreement one country profits at the
expense of another and there is a general
disturbance of values.
"As for this 16 to 1 agitation, I don't
know what will come of it, I am sure.
The people seem to have gone wild over
it. It may be all right, but I don't know.
It makes no difference to the world if the
ratio is 16 to lor3o to L It ii the silver*

mine owners and holders of silver stock
who are interested in tbe value of silver.
But I am a thorough-going bimetallism
Tne ratio of 16 to 1 concerns only a few
silver miners; bimetallism concerns the
whole world. The prosperity of the world
depends upon it.
"Money cannot be a question of the in
terests of a clique of men. It is a ques
tion affected by the commercial relations
of all commercial countries and must be
settled by international agreement It
has been proved that bimetallism is tbe
only financial policy under wnich the
world can prosper, therefore the interna
tional agreement should be for bimetal
lism. It is necessary and possible to draw
the countries which are at present under
the single standard into the agreement,
and I am sure that bimetallism will win
out in the end."

A JAPANESE BARON HERE,
Has Been Minister to St. Peters
burg for the Last Ten
Years.
Is Accompani d by the J panese Consul
at New York, and Both Are
Going Horns.
Two notable Japanese arrived at the
Palace Hotel last night from New York
and were welcomed by Acting Consul
Funakoshi and Mr. Aoki, agent of the
Yokohama Specie Bank.
One, Baron Nissi, for the last ten years
Japanese Minister Plenipotentiary at St.
Petersburg, is on his way home for good,
his term having expired. The other, K.
Miyagawa, Consul at N- w York, is going to
Japan to transact some important official
business, after winch he expects to return
to New York, where he has be. n stationed
only since last year.
Baron Nissi is 49 years of age. He will
probably on his return to Japan be pro
moted to some high Government position
in recognition of his services and rank, so
says Consul Miyaeawa. Until fur years
ago, when the Baron last visited Japan,
his wife lived with him in the Russian
capital, but since that visit she has re
mained at home. Baron Nissi was in
San Francisco twenty-six years ago when
he first went to Europe, and then again
twelve years ago when he was here as es
cort in the suite of tne Prince of Japan.
Both irentiemen will sail for Japan on
the 21st in the City of Peking.
Speaking of the proposed Japanese
steam-Â»liip lines Mr. Miyagawasavs that he
saw President Asano last week, just before
he starteil for England. Asano informed
him that his plans would be uncertain
until he had completed his visit in Eng
land. One thing, however, he will
not run a line of Bteamers
to Europe, that field being already
occupied by his countrymen, but he will
have a line running to Asia Minor to the
Russian oil region. Asano may have his
ships built on the Clyde, where ail other
Japanese ships â  aye been built, but he is
not decided yet to overlook America and
his own country in that respect.

The municipal and legislative conven
tion now being held by the American

office by the convention is a promise to
give a good, clean administration to the

positively firm as regarde the principles
of the order on the public school question.
Former affiliations with existing politi
cal parties neither gives preference nor
debars candidates from the support of the
convention if they otherwise meet with
the requirements of the pledge for good
government and the public school ques
tion.
The convention is composed of 150, each
council being entitled to its representa
tion according to its numerical strength
in the order, wit an equal representation
for the lodges of the Junior. Ord r of
American Mechanics.
The bolting delegates who were reported
to have left the convention on last Thurs
day evening number only ten, some of
whom returned after second consider
ation.
The convention expects to conclude its
labors by the early part of next week
when the names of the nominees will be
made public, and then the necessary steps
will be taken to comply with the require
ments of the law to have ti e names placed
on the ticket by the Registrar of Voters
