Cassasa's band played "The Arkansas
Traveler," "The Belle of the Mohawk
Vale," and other old-time airs redolent of
the American prairies, as the Miners'
State Convention Sled into Odd Fellows'
Hall yesterday morning.
It was fortunate that the music was
there, for the air was damp and chill be
cause of the drizzly weather outside, and
the hall was as gloomy as a cavern. Even
the lighting of the gas chandelier on
the stage would have emphasized the 1
gloom were it not for the music, which
drove away the darkness, the dampness,
- the rheumatism, the malaria and the
other demons of the air which guard the
hidden treasures of the gold mines from
the hardy miners of California.
This was so unmistakably the case that
when the band failed to make its appear
ance at the opening of the afternoon ses
sion it was found necessary to light nearly
all the gas jets in the hall.
It was a representative body that as
sembled yesterday morning. While the
majority of the delegates were miners, ;
there was a plentiful sprinkling of lawyers >
and millionaire, for every one knows that â 
w.ealth produces litigation ana that Cali
fornia gold mines produce millionaires.
Mr. Xeff, in calling the : convention to
order, said:
I congratulate yon and the cause of the min
ing industry upon the fourth assembly of the
annual convention of the Caiiiornia* Miners'
Association. lam pleased to see so many of
you here. It proves that interest in this asso
ciation is not lacking, but increasing, ana it
only remains to us to be true to ourselves and
to the interest tnai we are advocating that the '
great mining industry oi this const wll. come
.to the lore and that it Is, as it has been, one of \
the leading industries to carry on the pros
perity 01 this great State.

Chairman Wolff read his address, as
follows: *
Fellow-miners and Members of the Conven
tion: This assemblage oi ;he representatives
of the mining industry of California, entirely
unpolitical ana non-partisan in its character,
j is one <>i great importance, not only to this
j State itself, but to all others where precious
, metal mining in carried on. Circumstances
lorced us to take the lead in California in form
ing the first Miners' Association in the United
States, entirely free from all questions relating
to labor troubles, or strikes, or wages, and de
â  voted solely to the general interests in mining
i and the remedying of such existing evils as
j were detrimental to the industry. .
It is true that the original purpose of the
I organization was to endeavor to rehabilitate
i hydraulic mining in our own State, but it was
soon realized that the objects of the associa
tion must be broadened, and. in so widening
the scope of our work we ' were enabled to ac-
I complish objects of general benefit >to all
| miners, whether pursuing their occupation in
I California or other States of the Union. In
â  this way we were in a position to demand and
receive the assistance before Congress of the
representatives from other mining States,
through which means more has baen accom
plished than nad we carried on our work
single handed.
Within the past two years another Miners'
Association, similar to ours, has been placed
on a working basis in the Northwestern States,
including Oregon, Washington and Idaho, and
our fa;ow-mint:rs in tho-e regions are pre
pared toco-operate with us and assist in carry
ing out any proposed measures. With the
backing ol these thousands of miners forming
these associations, we are in a position to
receive a respectful hearing before Congress
or the Legislatures, with some reasonable ex
pectation of having what we ask granted.
Beiore the formation of this association- the
individual miner was left to his own resources.
I No matter how much cause of complaint he
might have had, or under what injustice he
I might be suffering, his single-handed efforts
; before the courts, the Legislature, the land
offices or Congress, were scarcely heeded, and
he could accomplish nothing. One man fight
| ing for relief from obnoxious laws or depart
ment rulings, and demanding a change, would
not be recognized as representing an industry
but when ail of the class identified with that
industry band. together in a common cause
and through these representatives demand
relief, '.; the : department, the Legislature and
Congress itself must listen to their appeals and
give consideration to their requests, Under
these circumstances the American people, who
are more powerful than these : bodies of their
own creation, will < make themselves heard
where the cause is just, as was ours, and their
influence mater. ally aids in the accomplish
ment of the desired ends : ; : . â¢ > â¢- -
-Believing as I -do in the future of this or
ganization and its continued power lor doing
good to the mining industry, I have thought
li proper to recite as briefly as may be some of
the facts connected : with its earlier history
ana formation, since I am familiar with them
from the fact of -having hÂ«d what 1 consider
the distinguished honor of having been chosen
chairman of the first : meeti g in Placer
j County, where the start was 'made, and the
first president of the resulted Caliiornia Min
ers' Association. ' â¢.v â ; â : ... . ..? -'.â _. '- : - .Â» â â '

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 11, 1896.
from a mere corporal's guard to the condition I
of affairs as it was when we began, and to |
those persons through whose early efforts this
great h.-s elation was mane possible.
In 1891 Thomas B. Everett, a Placer County
miner, who, like some thousands of others,
had been having hard times of it with the
closing down of the hy<irau ie mines, sug
gested to J. A. cher, editor of the Auburn
Herald, the idea of calling a miners' meeting
at Auburn, with a view of holding a county i
miners' convention, and ultimately one of the
miners of the whole State, to cousider the con
dition oi the hydraulic miners and. ii possible,
afford them some re ief. On the 18th of No
vember, 1891. this meeting was held, and re
sulted in the Placer County Miners'conven
tion at Auburn, November 28," to prepare for a
State convention to be held on January 20,
1892. â  j
Among other things a committee was ap-
I pointed to isKue an address to. tno people of
the State calling RitÂ«ruion to tilt: clp;Jorahl" â 
condition of ihe"xatii>ig'*'iiKlusrry ; Â«:.<l the'
nessures of relief, desired. . This important
' committee consisted of Kussell L. Dunn, Dr.
M. Schaebel, J. M. Fulweller, George H. Colby,
I J. B. Hobson, J. A. Fiicher, J. H. Ni-ff, Charles
C. Yale,* Dr. N. Martin, D. W. Spear and A.
j Stevens. After two days' work the address
I was issued for publication in the newspapers.
j It was an appeal to the people of California in
behalf of the miners' cause and had the effect
of creating a favorable impression, which was
i borne- out by the results of the State Conven
tion. '
The standing executive committee of Placer
i County was given full power to promulgate
! the call and make the arrangements for the
i State Convention. This committee consisted
, ol Charles G. Yale, John- B. Hobson, B. F.
! .Hartley, John. Spaulding and myself. It so
| happened that Mr. Yale, who was at that time'
editor of the Mining and Scientific Press, was.
I the only man from Sun Francisco who at-
I tended the Placer County Miners' Convention,
j and he was placed upon the executive com
j mittee and entrusted with organizing the
work In . San Francisco. It was* realized that
â  without the aid of the people and press of I the
I metropolis of California little or nothing
could De accomplished. It shows what the
general ieeling was at that time against hy
draulic mining when it is stated that it was
I only with the greatest difficulty any one could
; be induced to take any leading p'irt in the
movement to rehabilitate it or give it any
countenance whatever. Mr. Yale was greatly
aided in ins missionary work by William C.
Ralston, Robert MeMurray, Thomas B. Church
and a few others, but though many promised
support, at the first meeting held to consider
the subject there were only sixteen men in
this great City who attended or paid any at
tention to the matter. -
Just think of it, gentlemen. In a State
founded on its gold mines, in a great City
built by the gold mines, filled with million
aires and merchants who had made their for
tunes in mining, only sixteen men could be
found at thdt time who. were willing to come
forward and lend their names and influence
toward relmbilitating a branch of the indus
try, fallen into decadence through adverse ju
dicial decision, and which had formerly
poured ten millions of dollars in new gold an
nually into the channels of trade in this City.
Here was an investment of one hundred mil
lions of dollars lying idle in our midst, unpro-
I ductive, unused and valueless. We were not
i about to ask to recommence our operations on
the iormer basis and permit our tailings to go
where they won. dâ into the rivers or onto the
farming lands. That time had passed, and no
one recognized it more than ourselves.
Poverty, distress loss of property, litigation
and bitter controversy were hard schools of
experience, but had been ours." Idle men, de
â¢ serted mining camps, crumbling ditches and
reservoirs, rusted pipe lines, empty dwellings,
abandoned diggings and the almost depopula-
I tion of what had ueen formerly prosperous
mining sections had brought despair to thou
sands throughout the mountains of California.
Their only gluam of hope lay in a recently
I published report of a commission of Govern
ment engineers, the first favorab.e sign for,
years of the possibility of resumption of opera
â  tions in the hydraulic mining regions. They
I were about to meet together to ask the people
j of the City and the State for their assistance
i before Congress in favor, of measures looking
to the relief of this great industry, once so pro
ductive, now fallen into decay. And yet what
a beggarly gathering in numbers was this first
meeting in Sau Francisco to inaugurate such
a movement. It is scarcely conceivable in the
light of what followed, and .was discouraging
in the extreme.
So bitter had been the controversy on the
debris question and so long continued the liti
gation that a strong prejudice existed against
the hydraulic miners wnich was streiigtimced
by their having lost the fight in the courts.
The great opposing influence of the successful
and powerlul Anti-Debris Association of the
valleys had fostered this prejudice Â»nd in
creased it. The growth in power and wealth
of the agricultural interest* of the State and
the * decadence â iv ; the mining - industry, due
greatly to the enforced closing down of these
very mines, had caused many to throw their
influence against the miners' side. The press
was either actively . opposed to the miner or
silent regarding him and his industry. Public
opinion was not in his favor.. It was thought
that agriculture ana horticulture had . almost
entirely supplante 1 v the scare â¢ for gold, and
these were the reasons for the small success of
our first efforts in San Francisco.
.But thos who bad tne; work in hand were
not dismayed. As one who was appointed a
delegate from Sau Francisco to the State, con
vention declined or few dropped aside another
was cheseu in his place, until final, y the full
quota was obtained. In the mountains they
were eager to come and no man resigned, for
they realized all there was at stake. ; - â 
;r Finally, on January. 20, 1832, the first State
convention of tne miners ol California was
held in San Francisco, and was an overwhelm
ing tsucceÂ«s. - There was a complete revulsion
oi popular feeling. - Even our old enemies, the
valley men, held .out a.hel|-iuir hand on be
coming convinced of the sincerity of our In
.tenuous and our desire to resume the mining
.work only where the conditions-, were % such as
to permit it being carried on without material
injury to the- navigable streams or the lands
along the banks. \ The resolutions : and me
mortals adopted by the convention were digni
fied and conservative, recognizing the rights'
of others as well a? our own, and the speeches
made by prominent men were! of a nature to
assure the public of a cessation of the long
continued controversy and an amiable settle
ment of sting differences. Care was taken
in the appointment of the more important
of the committees to select conservative men
and to piaco' upon them not only the miners
but representatives of the valley interests as
well, that there should be lull and free dis
cussion of the subjects and that both interests
should have voice in our deliberations. That
the course and policy was the best was proven,
by the results obtained.
As an instance may be cited the case of : the
committee on memorial charged with the
duty ot pr -par ing a memorial to Congress, in
j which the hydruu.ic mining situation in caÂ»l
-| fornia should i..Â». ft >orth and measures of re

tory to iw3ii J. both mountain an 1 valley their â¢
differences could not be well adjusted at that
I time and controversy instead of amity would
i result. This committee consisted' of twenty
five members, miners and anti-debris men be
ing both represented. After a long utscussiou
of the points involved it was finally decided
to select two men, one representing each in
terest, to draft this important document, and
they were leu to themselves to do this work,
the rest ot the committee retiring. Robeit T.
Devlin of Sacramento, the attorney of the
Anti-Debris Association, was selected on the
part of the farmers and Charles G.Yale of San
Francisco to represent the miners of Califor
; nia. It was the first time in years that the
representative! 01 these two contending fac
tious had been brought together on friendly
terms and with a common object in view. S.Â»
j amicably and well, was the work performed
j that the committee reported favorably on the
I memorial at once andXhe convention adopted
I it unanimously.
It was the expression not only of the miners
of California, but ot the farmers as well, and
formed the basis for the measures of relief
I enacted by Congress/which once again set
j our ditches flowing, our giants pouting,
I opened our golden streams and rehabilitated
| the almost dying hydraulic mining industry
oi California.
' Unity 'of action and fair-mindedness
achieved a victory where individual effort,
controversy and litigation had failed. Of al
most equal importance was the committee on
resolutions, which should tell the people of
the State what our intentions and desires
were and how we expected to accomplish our
ends. And, moreover, another important
committee had to arrange for the permanent
| organization of '.he California Miners' Associa
tion. I want to recall to you here present the
names of the. chairmen of -these three repre
sentative committees of our first convention,
because so much depended on their work and
because they d.d it so well. C. W. Cross was
the chairman of the committee on resolu
tions, Tirey L. Ford of the committee on
permanent organization and Cnarles C.
ale of the committee on memorial to Con
gress.
When our first convention adjourned and
we organized the California Miners' Associa
tion we at once realized that we had the
assistance and -moral support of the people
and the press of the State. We were given a
backing far beyond what was even expected.
Tke- Chamber of Commerce,, the Board of
Trade and Board of Supervisors of San Fran
cisco passed resolutions indorsing our me
morial and oar objects,, as did the Boards of
Supervisors throughout the interior counties.
The merchants aud manufacturers ot this
city were wonderfully liberal in their dona
tions of needful money to carry on our- work,
and money came. from other places as well.
The different county miners' associations re
sponded liberally to our call for financial help
and the Caliiornia Miners'. Association was'
fairly and successfully launched, with public
favor enlisted in its behalf. -â  ' . . â  Â«
For these results we are largely indebted to
.the press of this City and State, for had it not
viewed our efforts with: favor, we could not
have gained popular approval. * To the editors
of California the mineie of the State owe < a
debt of gratitude almost- beyond measure.
The Mining and Scientific Press, particularly,
has always been our friend. . . . -
; And the miners are under heavy obligations
also to certain gentlemen in*- this association
who toiled early and laic in their behalf with
out expectation or desire of reward." As your
president and a member of the various work
ing committees I 1 know that our objects could
not have been carried out without their active
and intelligent assistance. It would' be im
possible to name all who have been helpful: to
us in carrying on the executive work or upo:i
whose advice and assistance I have so largely
depended. But promindnt among them have'
been your secretaries, William C. RÂ«lston and
Julian Sonutag. Both of these gentlemen have

During our : early organization C. W. Cross
gave us most material aid in many ways sug
gested by his professional experience and
knowledge relating to hydrauiic. mining and
the litigation connected with it, and* he con
tinues to assist us to-day. â¢ Tirey L. Ford, as
chairman of the committee : on legislation
Mil Co we commenced our work and as our
Representative before Congress at the last ses
sion, has been absolutely uutiriug in his zeal
for the interests of the ', miners of the ; State.
â  I i : is unnecessary :to elaborate on ' his report 1
and the valuable information it con tains, for
copies have been placed in the hands of each
of you. , Mr. Ford's individual work in i our
State-Legislature has given us laws ol the ut
most importance ; to < the hydraulic miner,' and
his advice nd assistance have been freely given
on all occasions. A. H. Ricketts did a splendid
work for us as chairman of the Committee on
Mineral Lands us our attorney, in Washington,
and ire- ly donated a large amount of bis valu
able time to our .cause. Among other attor
neys who have materially aided us with their
gratuitous professional advice are J. M.Wright,
E A. Belcher, J. M. Walling.
i We should not forpet ex-Governor Markham,
who. as the chief executive of this State, first
called the attention of the Legislature and the
people of California to the deplorable condi
tion of the hydraulic mining industry, and
(suggested that measures of relief be instituted.
The gentleman who acted as manager of our
successful mineral exhibit at the Midwinter
Fair. Edward H. Benjamin, also placed us un
der lasting obligations for the use oi his name
in the protests to prevent the railroad com
panies from patenting mineral lands.
. In the early days when we were struggling
hard with the Canunetti act, Niles Searls,
John Hobson and Robert McMurray fought
ably for vi before the committees of Congress.
In the collection of necessary funds we have
been greatly aided by Samuel K. -Thornton,

; I should be : derelict in .my duty did I not
mention specially the very intelligent and
constant â¢ services performed by â  one who is
best known to us all as -'Charley" Yale. As
one of the organizers of this - movement in be
half of the miners of California, he has been
one of my most valued assistants on the execu
tive and other important standing commit-
I tees,' Mas never l altered in his zeal, and never
failed to do any amount of work for which we
called upon him. - With a thorough knowledge
of the subjects before us, and a ready pen, he
has not only greatly assisted us in 'the prepara
tion of numerous important documents, reso
lutions, etc., but has ably fought our battles
in the public press, and helped to enlist its in
flusnee in our behalf. The conservative and
successful policy csiried out in the adminis
tration of our affairs is largely due to bis ad
vice and metnod of bringing them before the
public in the beginning. I ireely acicnowiedge
my own obligations for his valuable assist
ance in many ways, an.l assure you that he
deserves the thanks of the Association of the
Miners of California. ' â¢ ::. .
. I undertake to say that no organization has
ever accomplished such important results with
such small expenditure.' No officer of the as
sociation has received one dollar from the
treasury lor professional services, nor has any
one else connected with the management of its
a flairs. .
- Being about to retire from the presidency of
your association I have thought it my duty, as
it la my pleasure, to recall ' to you the names
of those more prominent in the conduct ot its
affairs in the past since I have been in a posi

have performed. I de-ire to return my sincere
thanks to all of them for the many lavors ex
tended to me as your president, and thank
them also in behalf of the association, to
whose â¢ success they â  have so largely contrib
uted. As to the future of this association I
have every -confidence in it. There are many
measures which will be of benefit to the min
ing industry of the State which still demand
consideration -at your hands. Prominent
among them are the needs of a representative
of the mining industry iv the councils of the
Nation, for there should be a Secretary of
Mines in the Cabinet, that our large and grow
ing interests should be guarded. Moreover,
closer at home; there should be in the State
University; where there is already a college of
mines and professors of mining, one or more
representatives of the mining interests in the
Board of Regents. . ; - ,' â  . -,':.,â¢ â 
. â¢ You should continue Â«to ', lend 'â  your â¢ moral
support aud influence to the maintenance of
the â¢ State Mining Bureau, which is now doing
useful work iv behalf of the mining industry
of â  the , State. ; This, institution should Do fos
tered and encouraged in every way by all of
us. | On our mineral lands bill in congress let
us not falter or', hesitate. Public opinion is
with us in this matter, and Congress has been
"educated" Con :: . the question. â¢ The measure
cannot fail of passage. We only ask that. the
railroad companies be prevented from acquir
ing any more mineral lands in this Slate,
which' were, by J their land grants, expressly
reserved for the minors. : Other lauds were
given them , for such mineral tracts set aside,
so they have no real cauxe of -complaint. It is
but just that the mineral lands, set aside as
the domain for the , miner and prospector,
should be kept for them as intended, and it
rests mainly with this association to contest
the false claims of the railroad companies,
have the lands properly classified - and : leave
the T mineral â¢ for * the ' prospector of the future,
for whom Congress plainly intended it. ; \t -â 
Numerous changes in the mining laws seem
necessary for the protection of the miner's in
terests and the proper conduct of his business.
All such proposed amendments Â» should ,be
cAretuily considered â¢ by. your committee on
legislation before receiving the indorsement
of .this association, in' order : that when our

was necessary to remedy - them, when . their
sympathies were at once enlisted in our behalf

conducting the hydraulic-mining business as
to work no injury to any man or any interest.
We have asked for no radical changes in the

us hope that the work we have accomplished

derive a benefit and cause him to pause in bis
work and thank the Miners' Association of
California for what it did in his behalf.

Tirey L. Ford read the following report
of his work in Washington: : .
The movement for the rehabilitation of the
hydraulic mining industry, begun with the
formation of the California . Miners' Associa
tion in 1892, has steadily advanced in public
opinion, and has been favorably considered by
the law-making bodies of both State and Na
tion. The foundation for ultimate success has
been securely, laid, and. with united and de
termined action upon the part of those most
deeply interested, the final result should not
be a matter of serious doubt.
It should not be forgotten, however, that the
work is but fairly began, and that much yet
remains to be accomplished. An unfortunate
antagonism still exists in certain quarters,
though, happily, confined to narrow and ever
contracting limits. Our National Congress is
slow to recognize the importance of the work,
and is still in doubt as to the limits of its juris
diction in the premises. 'Added to all this the
miners of California are themselves not wholly
in accord as to the best means of accomplish
ing the desired results.
The first matter that should engage the seri
ous attention of the California Miners' Ass
ociation is that of agreeing upon a definite line
of policy to be â  pursued by the friends of the
hydraulic-mining industry in their efforts to
restore it to its rightful station among the in
dustries of California. â  Either the , policy out
lined by the Biggs Commission and amplified
by the Caminetti act should continue to guide
the association in the future as it has in the
past or a new policy, should be definitely
agreed upon that would bring harmony and
increased energy to . the cause. :As one who
has watched the cause through its various
stages and has given to It a considerable de
gree lof '> attention, your representative begs
leave to suggest that it would be well to care
fully consider any proposed change be.'ore de
parting from the policy which has" hitherto
guided the association, and to which Congress
is in a large measure committed. '. 'â -..". .-. â 
. .With a : definite policy agreed upon, every
energy should be directed to a' proper present
ation of our case at Washington, whence must
come the final relief to which the miners of
Caliiornia are so clearly entitled.
Mr. Ford added that the report of neces
sity omitted something of the details of
the work at Washington. He desired 1 to
express i! his thanks to all those who had
done valiant service toward securing the
results that had been noted. â¢â : Never before
had they real zed clearly the results that
followed from the union of strength. - It
was at first a herculean task and miners
hail to be gathered from remote and iso
lated localities, accessible only on the hur
ricane deck of a mule. ;
The association had reached the turn- ;
ing point ol its career. By pursuing the
right methods the ruining industry would 1
dp known as it was never known beiore.
The y f had % secured lan ? appropriation of
$250,000/ unhampered xby a single condi
tion, for the benefit of the hydraulic-miner
and the farmer. Every ? member of the
Caliiornia delegation was entitled to the
heartfelt thanks of the association. The
miners' cause â  had also ? received many â 
j courtesies fro rn^ Republicans and Demo
crats ou' the Congressional Committee, all
1 but two of ! wnom opposed the appropr a
tion. Th y were Barrett of Massachusetts
'â  and Cooper of Wisconsin, who, were of the
, opinion that vit was purely a private af
fair, and they fought it to the very end.
. Tue Secretary of War had given his. in
| R'ructions to the engineers, and at least
I $250,000, would be expended in the con-
I struct.on of . restraining " barriers , in this
J â State;
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The bill relating to mineral lands of
Calnornia was introduced in the lower
house by Johnson of California, but the
miners delegation wer- never wholly able
to convince Chairman Lacy of the entire
justice of their claim.-, but fortunately
they had some very able friends on the
committee. Amon^ them were Congress
man Bowers of California. Ellis of Oregon,
Wilson of Idaho and McÃ:te of Arkansas.
Mr. Ford added that the miners owed a
detnof gratitude to Senator Dv Bois of
I iaho, but for whose act of friendship it
wag a very grave question whether the
Dill would have ever emerged from the
Committee on Public Lands. Senator
Pascoe of Florida, Pettigrew oi South
Dakota, Berry of Arkansas, Caner of
Montana, were also good friends of the
bill. Senators White and Perkins of Cali
fornia performed some very tine parlia
mentary maneuvers in behalf of the bill.
"It seems to me," added Mr. Ford,
"that the wholesale denunciation of
Speaker Reed which has been indulged in
is wholly unwise and wholly unwarranted.
In the first &lace it is not the part of wis
dom to co with a club in your nand to the
men from whom you expect favors.
'This association should appreciate that
it is uncer a debt of gratitude to Mr. Reed.
When the outlook for our appropriation
was the most dark, and at tha tiaie when
the River and Harbor Committee had ac
tually voted not io include it, ia their re
port, Mr. Reed gave a number of our dele
gation a hearing, and being satisfied with
the justice of our cause, threw ihe whole
weight of his influence in our behali to
have that matter included in the river and
harbor improvement bill, a;id to-day yon
owe him gratitude for that $250,000 appro
priation. [Applause.] There can be now
no question as to the passage of the land
bill in the short session of Congress next
montb."
Mr. tord read the report of the commit
tee on legislation, as follows:
To the President, Officers and Members of the
California Mixers' Association â Gentlemen :
Your committee- on legislation begs leave to
make the following report:
Your committee begs to refer to its report
made to the association prior to its last annual
convention, in October, 1895.
Since that time there has been no meeting of
the Legislature of this State.
The Fifty-;ourth- Congress, however, met in
regular session in December, 1895, and con
tinued in session until June, 1896. â¢ Your com
mittee, acting under instructions fiom the
association, presented to Congress four meas
ures for the consideration of that body. These
measures were:
I.
A bill intended to reduce the penalties pro
vided for in tlie so-calied Camineui act, being
officially entitled:
"A bill to amend an act entitled 'An act to
create the California Debris Commission and
regulate hydraulic mining in the .Mate of Cali
fornia.' Approved March 1, 1893, by amend
ing section 22 thereof."
n.
A bill to amend the Federal mining laws,
with particular reference to the manner of lo
cating, holding and working mining claims,
and tne transier of contests as to the agricul
tural or mineral character of land from the
land otiices to the local courts, being officially
entitled:
"A bill to amend chapter VI, title 32 of the
Revised Statutes, relating to mineral lands
aud mining resources."
in.
A bill looking to the segregation of the un
patemed mineral lauds within the railroad
land grants in Cal fornia, locally known as
the mineral lands bill and officially entitled:
"A bill to provide for the examination and
classification of certain lauds in the State of
California,"
IT.
"A bill to appropriate money for the con
struction of works to impound mining debris
and thereby to protect the navigable streams
of Caliiornia."
For an account of the action taken by Con
gress upon the above measures you arc re
spectfully reierred to the report rendered Dy
your representative in Washington, entitled:
'â Report of Hon. Tirey L. Ford in relation
to his services at Washington in 1896 in be
half ol certain mining legislation," which has
been printed for distribution among the mem
bers of {he association.
Your committee is of the opinion that with
proper efforts the so-called "mineral lands"
bill above referred to should become a law dur
ing the approaching session of Congress, which
begins in December and ends in March next.
In addition to the work necessary to secure
the final passage and approval of the above
mitiv-'ral lands bill, your committee deems it
advisable that -whatever doubts now exist as
to the availability of the appropriation made
by the State of California through the Legis
lature of 1893, should bu removed at the
approaching session of our State Legislature,
which convenes in January next. The Na
tional Congress having made an unconditional
appropriation which fairly meets the terms oi
our State appropriation, the State can voW
well afford to so amend the wording of its
appropriation as to eliminate all conditions
and contingencies theretrom. This to your
committee appears to be oi cons.derable im
portance and si.ould engage the earnest and
immediate attention of the assoeiaiion.
Your committee mrther begs leuve to renew
its former suggestions that our Federal mining
law 3 should be so revised as to make them not
only harmonious but in keeping with the
j changed conditions since their original enact
ment. In this behalf your committee begs
leave to suggest that a work of such import
ance and magnitude should not be hastily un
dertaken nor left to the action of committees
already overburdened with other work. Your
committee therefore suggests that a special
committee be appointed, to be kuewn as the
committee upon the revision of the Federal
mining laws, whose du-.y it shall be to thor
oughly examine the mining laws of the United
States and other mining countries and to for
mulate and present to the association at its
next annual meeting a complete code of Fed
eral mining laws, to be presented to Congress
for action by that body. Respectfully sub
mitted,

To the Officers and Members of the Santa Clara
County Miners' Association: Your committee ap
pointed (or the purpose of formnl&ting resolu
tions to be presented at the next meeting of
the California Slate Miners' Association beg
to report as fol.ows:
Vr'HEBEAS. It h%s been suggested by repre
sentatives of the California Slate Miners' As
sociation that there should be added to tne
Cabinet of the President of the United states
an officer to be known as Secretary of Mines
and .Mining, who shall exercise general super
vision over the mining Interests of this coun
try; and whereas, it has been further sug
gested and recommended that the office of In
spector of Mines should be esiabjisued in this
Bute for the purpose of fosteriufj aud pro
tecting the mining industry of California; and
whereas, we have been authentically in
formed that Jacob Keff, president of the Cali
fornia State Miners' Association, has expressed
his intention of retiring from that important
position, it is hereby
Rttolved, That this ussociatlon heartily and
unanimously indorse the appointment by the
President of the United Sates of a Cabinet
officer to be known as Secretary oi Mines aud
Mining; and be it further
Setolved, That this association consider it I
for the best interests au<i general eood and |
welfare of the miners of this State that there j
should be appointed by the Legislature of this
State, or otherwise, a:i impecior of mines in i
this Stato; and further be v
Hesolved, That we appreciate in the fjreatesi |
rtegree the gratuitous services renderea the :
State association, and thereby every mininz j
interest and miner in California, by Jacob
Neff and others, who have so graciously. Mi- :
untarily and without corupensstion tendered '
their services toward perpetuating the causi;
whose success we so earnestly doire.
Set'Ured, Tnat H is the profound and sincere i
wish of this association that Jacob Neff l^ in- ;
duced and persuaded to again accept tiie office
which he now fills with such universal aiuis
l&ction and credit.
James Carson (chairman), A. C. Innes, C. F.
O'Brie.n, K. J. Peakce, T. S. Lowell.
The resolutions were approved and
placed on tile.
Judge Walling of Nevada moved that
the thanks of the association be tendered I
to Mr. Ford.
Chairman Neff remarked that no mem
ber of the association had a higher appre
ciation of the value of Mr. Ford's services
than he. He told how the miners' com
mittee had voted the sum of $1000 to partly
repay Mr. Ford for his valuabe service?,
and how Mr. Ford had eenerousl}* declined
to accept a dollar.
Mr. Ford was thereupon tendered a vote
of thanks by all the members rising to
their feet and eivine; Mr. Ford three rous
ing cheers. The recipient was very much
affected by the proceedings and returned
his thanks, saying that whatever advance
ment he had made in material progress
had had its foundation in the good wiil of
the miners of tnis State.
The following committee vras appointed
on order of business: C. W. Cross, Georgo
Stone, Edward Coleman, J. M. Walling
and Harold T. Power.
A. L. Moore and J. R. Young were ap
pointed sergeants-at-arms.
The following opinion of the Attorney-
General was read and referred to the com
mittee on resolutions:
San Francisco, October 28, 1396.
John F. Kidder, Debris Commissioner, Grans
Valley. Co.â Sib: I am in receipt of your I
letter of ihe 16th inst., stating that tue United
States Debris Commission had received orders
from Washington to locate and construct a
dam for the impounding and restraining of
deb.is already in the Yuba River, and that
said commission wishes to know whether or
not you are authorized to enter into a joint
contract on behalf of the State of California
lor the construction of said dam, wijlh the pro
viso that the contractor must look to the State
Board of Examiners for the allowance of bis
monthly estimates.
I have given this matter very careful con
sideration, and am of the opinion that you
are not authorized to enter into any contract
on behalf of the State jointly or otherwise for
the construction of said dam or other works
for the impounding and restraining of debris.
The act under which you told your office
and which prescribes your duties is entitled
"An act to provide for the appointment,
duties and compensation of a debris commis
sioner, and to make an appropriation to be ex
pended under his direction in the discharze of
his duties as such commissioner." [Stats. 1895,
339. ]
Section 3 of said act provides:
Whenever any board of engineers of the United
States Government shall tiav- been appointed
. with power t-> adopt pUns and specifications for
the construction of worics for the impounding at
raining debris it shall De the duty of said Debris
Commissioner to consult and adviso with such
board of engineers of the United states Govern
ment and to examine and pass upon the merits of
such works, and said Debris Commissioner shall
determine whether <r not such works are calcu
lated to be and are sufficient to proiect the navi
gable waters of the state, and to keep a record of
such determinations.
Section 4 of said act, after making an appro
priation to be used in the construction of
works for the restraining and impounding of
mining debris, provides:
Bald money to be paid only upon order drawn by
the Comptroller upon the written request of the
said 1 ebris Commissioner to be drawn only
for the payment of not more than one-ha f of the
cost of the construction of any such works for re
straining an<i impounding mining debris as shall
be approved by him and duly adopted and lvcom
mewled by engineers of the i. nitea Btites Gov
ernment appointed for that purpose.
These are the only duties prescribed by said
act and it is apparent that no authority is
conferred upon the Debris Commissioner, nor
is there any implied authority given to enter
into any contract for the actual construction
of such work. At the time the above act was
approved (March 24, 1893) and became a law
an act had been passed by Congress and ap
proved by the President to create the Califor
nia Debris Commission and reguU'e hydraulic
mining in the State of California (United State*
Statutes at Large, 1895, 507), which provided
ior the appointment of a commission to pre
sent plans and specifications of all work for
the improvement and protection of tne navi
gable streams of California and to prevent the
depositing of mining debris or other materials
within the same and directing and empower
ing such commission when appropriations are
made therefor by law, or sufficient money is
depositea for that purpose In said debris fund
to build at sucn points above the head oi navi
gation in said rivers and on the main tributa
ries thereof such restraining or impounding
dams and settling reservoirs, etc., as may be
necessary to protect and prevent injuring the

WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 10.-Post
master-General Wilson has , submitted to
the Secretary of the Treasury his estimates
for the Postcfflce Department for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1898. The First As
sistant Postmaster-General's office requires
$43,542,500, an increase over the previous
year of $2,012,750; the Seconds-Assistant
Postmaster-General's office $52,224,500, an
increase of $2,835,385; Third Assistant's
office $1,358,100, an increase of $37,400, and
for the office of Fourth Assistant; $383,311;
$6000 is asked for advertisements and mis
cellaneous matters, which makes a grand
total of $97,515,411. an increase over the
estimates of 1897 of $4,943,846.
As the expenditures lor the service of
1898 are estimated at $97,515,411, and the
revenue expected for the same year is
placed at $96,227,096, there will be an esti
mated deficiency of about $1,288,330. :
CUBAN PATRIOTS
ARE VERY ACTIVE
Preparing to Send Further
Re-enforcements to
the Island.
Not at All Alarmed by the Move
of Weyler in Taking
the Field.
YET CONFIDENT OF VICTORY.
With His Two Hundrvd Thousand
Troops the Captain-General
Cannot Conquer.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10.â Not
since tbe Cuban filibustering ship Haw
kins foundered off Barnegat with General
Calixto Garcia and a number of Cuban
revolutionists on board has there been
such activity at the Cuban Junta in this
city as was noted to-day. The announce
ment that General Weyler was about to
take the field, massing an army of 200,000
men on the island and end the insurrec
tion by one fierce onslaugbt'of war, has
stirred up the Cuban patriots of this city,
and inquiry for details is being made of
the members of tiie Junta.
The Cubans here do not express any
alarm as to the outcome, but they do
think that President Cleveland should
recognize the insurgents as beiligerents,
and by that act prevent the repetition of
Spanish barbarities which follow every
engagement in which ihe Spanish troops
obtain any advantage. It is said that the
Junta will again petition President Cleve
land to take action in regard to the
matter. Senor Castillo, one of the most
prominent members of the Junta, said
to-day :
"President Cleveland ought to accept
the belligerent resolutions of Congress as
the exposition of the people of tbis coun
try and act on them. From this time
until the summer months, if the war lasts
that lone;, the revolution will be vigor
ously prosecuted, and as both Cubans and
Spaniards are determined to end the
strife the most desperate battles of the
war will occur within the next few weeks.
The insurgeuts have now three dynamite
.runs, which have already done effective
work, and with these and the laree quan
tity of arms and ammunition which they
are receiving by every expedition they
are in better condition than at any time
heretofore.
"The report that Spain will make a de
termined effort to defeat the insurgents
does not frighten us, for we have heard
auch stories before, and so far as the 200,000
soldiers are concerned I am sure that
Spain cannot in her present condition
support such a large array.
"But," added Senor Castillo, "the insur
gents are well armed and in good health
and will continue tbe fight, regardless of
any action taken by the Spaniards."
Senor Trujillo, another patriot, is con
stantly in receipt of information from all
parts of the islands. Speaking of the bar
barities practiced by the Spanish troops,
he said to-day : "Many stories of Spanish
.atrocities have lately come from Cien
fuegos, Cuba, but of all those perpetrated
by the Spanish guerrillas in this district
on non-combatants, the killing several
days ago of Henry d'Abigeon, a wealthy
French-Canadian sugar-planter, is prob
ably the most ruthless of the outrages
charged to these men.
"The victim of this latest outrage wa*
an English subject, and the facts in the
case were at once made known
to British Consul Georee Fowler, who has
begun an investigation. Thus far the
Spanish soldiers have been careful not to
molest citizens of England, and the death
of d'Abigeon is the first which the repre
sentative of England has been compelled
to act upon, and the general feeling in
Cienfuegos is that Consu^ Fowler will de
mand either an indemnity or at least an
apology, and if this is not made, it is
likely that there will be considerable
trouble.
Â«."D'AbiÂ»eon was, visited at his summer
home at Rodas by four Spanish guerrillas
from Cartagena, a near-by town. Tbe
major of this band suspected D'Abigeon
of aiding the insurgents and wanted tbe
planter brought before him. When the
four guerrillas arrived at the house
D'Abieeon was sick and refused to accom
pany them to Cartagena, whereupon,
without warning and before the eyes of
his wife, the four emptied their rifles into
the unfortunate man's body, who died in
stantly."
Neither Senor Trujillo nor Senor Cas
tillo could say what, if any. action the
Junta proposed talcing, although;from the
activity noticeable at headquarter* the in
ference is drawn that re-enforcements are
likely to be sent to the Cuban patriots
from this side.
MANILLA'S INSURRECTION
Spain Encountering Humbert That Are
Hard to Overcome.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10.â The
Sun's Madrid correspondent, writing un
der date of October 27, says: Advices from
Manilla say that the insurgents had ar
tillery at the recent fight in Nagnusubuc,
where the Spanish claim to have won a
victory.
Father Ront, a conspicuous Augustinian
friar said to be well informed about Phil
ippine affairs, says that the rebellion is a
race movement; that before inflicting any
harm upon the Spanish in Gavite the in
surgents notified them to withdraw, and
only those were murdered who refused to
obey. He denies the stories that the in
surgents looted the city and committed all
sorts of outrages.
General Blanco telegraphed that Senor
Villamil, Civil Governor of Batangas,
abandoned his post and took refuge on a
merchant vessel for fear that the insur
gents might attack the city upon his arri
val in Manilla. Villamil was arrested
and shipped to Spain. Other dispatches
say that several new bands of 300 to 1000
men each have appeared in Batangas and
other provinces. ,
El Liberal says: The news received
from Manilla is somewhat grave. It shows
that the insurgents have the boldness to
organize new bands within districts oc
cupied by our own troops, and also that
they know how to attack, despite all that
has been said about their inaptitude for
war. All that we have been able to do is
to prevent the Gavite insurgents from
joining those in the mountains of Moro^
through La Laguna and ZÂ»yabas. The in
activity of our soldiers in Gavite, notwith
standing the arrival of re-eniorcements
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1896.
from Spain and 'Mindanao, reveals well
enough the strength of the insurrection.
If we are to prevent the insurrection from
spreading we must wait for the arrival of
the re-enforcements which are about to
leave for Manilla with General Polavieja.
Nearly all the press applauds the ap
pointment of General Polavieja for a mili
tary command in the Philippine Islands,
and, as reported before, there is no doubt
that he goes to. supersede Bianco. Refer
ring to him the Heraido says:
"General Polavieja's nomination will
disappoint no one in Spain except those
who saw in him a man needed for service
elsewhere." Yet the Heraldo is the organ
of General Weyler. -

POLICY Of CANADIANS,
They Want the Old Reciprocity
Treaty of 1854 Re
newed.
Delegation Going to Washington to
Negotiate It After McKinley's
In uguration
MONTREAL, Canada, Nov. 10.â Tbe
statement made in New York by the Hon.
W. S. Fielding, Canadian Minister of
Finance, that the Canadian Government
is Koing in for reciprocity with the United
States in earnest, and that representatives
will be sent to Washington shortly after
McKinley's inauguration to negotiate a
reciprocity treaty, creates much interest
among the Dusine-a men of this city.
The subject has now become a timely
topic of discussion. Hugh McLannan, a
prominent grain merchant, whose long
business experience ex;ends back to tbe
fifties and sixties, when a reciprocity
treaty was in force, said to-day:
"I am in favor of the renewal of thÂ«
treaty of 1854 if it be possible to secure
that, and I want to include privileges for
both nations of coast and inland waters.
I want it made possible for Canadian
vessels to carry cargoes from one Ameri
can port to another, and t: c same privi
lepe to be extended to American vessels.
"The treaty of 1854 whs certainly favor
able to the two countries, and 1 do not be
lieve the conditions ot to-day would maKe
any difference. If a new treaty be nego
tiated it should be as much as possible a
repetition of the treaty of 1854, with the
additions I have spoken of regarding nav
igation. It would certainly be to the ad
vantage of Canada to have reciprocity in
natural products.
"It is a mistake to think that the war
made any great difference at the time the
treaty was in force. The treaty did not
favor any particular part of Canada, but
all points were benefited by ihe trade it
brought on. As a matter of fact the cen
ters will not realize the benefits so much
as the country disirict9 would. The real
advantage is certainly for the farmer. As
to the objections which would be raised
insofar as manufacturing is concerned we
can safely let the Americana do that. Give
us reciprocity in natural products with
better coasting laws and free canals and
we will be satisfied."
TRADES UNIONS COMBINE.
Amalgamation at Chicago Representing
50,000 Active Workersâ Some
Spirited Debates.
CHICAGO. 111., Nov. 10.â Nearly 50,000
working men and women were represented
at a meeting at Bricklayers' Hall last
night, which resulted in the formation of
a new central trades union body. The
organization was not completed, but
enough was accomplished to insure the
success of the movement and to indicate a
perfect amalgamation of warring factions.
An adjournment was taken until to
night, when the erganization will be com
pleted by giving a name to the new body,
which will probably be the Chicago
Federation of Labor, and the election of
temporary officers. Permanent organiza
tion will be effected at a meeting to be
held two weeks hence.
President Samuel Gompersof the Amer
ican Federation of Labor presided. He
was assisted by Vice-Presidents James
O'Connell and P. J. Maguire.
The new body will be the only one of the
kind in existence. It was decided that no
delegates would be eligible who were not
earning their living in active work at their
trades. It was also decided to bar out
salaried officers of local unions and Fed
eral labor unions.
The proposition to admit walking-dele
gates and others not actively engaged at
their trades was hotly contested. Presi
dent Timblin of Typographical Union No.
16 led the riubt against admitting the men
who have led and dominated the labor
movement in Chicago for many years.
He declared many of the old leaders,
walking-delegates and other salaried of
ficers had repeatedly sold out their organ
izations and used their positions as step
ping-stones to political jobs.
TWO IOWA BANKS FAIL.
In One Case the Depositors Will Lose
Heavily, and in the Other They Will
Be Paid in Full.
SIOUX CITY, lowa, Nov. 10.â The lowa
Savings Bank failed to-day, posting n no
tice on its door this morning that it bad
suspended payment. Eri Richardson was
president; George W. Wakefield, rice
president, and F. B. Hutchins. cashier of
the institution. A statement this morn
ing showed assets in loans and discounts,
$419,000; cash, $617; liabilities, doe depos
itors. $122,000; capital stock, $250,000. The
bank also had a nominal surplus of $50,
-000. Inability to realize on assets except
at great sacrifice caused the failure. The
depositors will be paid in full and the
capital will be saved in part.
DECORAH, lowa. Nov. 10,-The First
National Bank of this city failed to open
its doors this morning as a result of a spe
cial examination by order of the Compt
roller of the Currency. Bank Examiner
Stone is in charge pending the appoint
ment of a receiver. The bank had suffered
a run for come weeks and was unable to
I convert assets fast enough. No statement
has been made public of its condition, but
it is said to be in such shape that the cap
ital will all be lost and depositors wilt lose
heavily.
SQUABBLE OVER THE STARS.
Sensational Testimony Given in the Con
troversy Over the lowa Guard
Brigadiers hip.
DES MOINES, lowa. Nov. 10.â The case
of John K. Prime vs. H. S. Wright, adju
tant-general, ana F. M. Drake, Governor
of lowa, will be heard in the District
Court Thursday. Prime claims to have
been elected brigadier of the First Brigade
while the commission was issued to James
A. Guest. The first election returns
showed Prime elected, but were thrown
out by Wright on the ground of fraud and
a new election ordered. This also re-
Bulted in Prime's election. Wright then
set aside the second election and made a
new canvass of the votes of the First,
throwing: out what he regarded as the
fraudulent votes, and declaring Guest
elected. The result was a split in the
Guard which has become serious and
threatens if the courts decide against
Prime to seriously injure the nervice.
Prime has brought a quo warranto pro
ceeding to compel the adjutant-general
and Governor to grant him the commis
sion. The hearing on this will begin on
Thursday. There will be sensational tes
timony to show that the Prime compa
nies filled their enlistment rolls in ad
vance ot the election in order to out vote
the Guest companies.
rXOsr-JSCTS JbOK A DUEL.
Ihe Son of Him Anther and Senator
lilitcl.-burn May tight.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10.â A Times
special from Washington says: Logan
Carlisle affects indifference to probable
troubles between himself and Senator
Blackburn. He makes light of warnings
given him by friends. The friends of the
two men will not talk for publication, but
they say privately that Logan Carlisle is
making too light of the affair.
They assert that both- men frequent the
same hotels, that Blackourn lays his prob
able loss of all chance of re-election to the
Carliales and this, his friends say, inten
sities his bitterness toward Logan Carlisle.
A Southern gentleman attached to a
Cabinet officer in an olhcial capacity said
yesterday :
"I regard trouble between Logan Car
lisle and Joe Blackburn as altogether
likely, and I want to tell Logan one thing:
Should he have occasion to strike Black
burn he should do so with a cane, unless
be be able to knock him out with his lists,
because if he simply slaps Blackburn's
face, the latter, who is looking for trouble
and will be armed, will shoot him. '
"I have seen too many men shot be
cause of their not arming themselves, not
to warn my friends. If Logan knocks
Blackburn out witn one blow, there may
be a duel, but if he simply slaps the Sena
tor, there will be a funeral in my opinion,
and Blackburn would come off the better
man in the affray."

GROVER'S NEXT MESSAGE
Financial Fortions Now Being
Prepared by President
Cleveland.
Part of the Administration's Policy Is
to Avoid Contraction of the
Currency.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10.â A Herald
special from Washington says: President
Cleveland is considering the financial por
tions of his annual message to Congress.
He has been in consultation with Secre
tary Carlisle and Postmaster-General Wil
son regarding the prospective revenues
and expenses of the Government, as well
as the reforms that are necessary to the
present monetary system, and his last an
nual message to Congress will discuss
these matters in detail.
The President will, as heretofore, recom
mend the retirement of the legal tender
notes of the Government, so as to take' the
Government out of the banking business
and make it impossible for speculators to
drain the treasury of gold by means of an
endless chain* of greenbacks and Sherman
notes, which must be reissued as fast as
they are redeemed.
In order to avoid any contraction of the
currency it is part of the administration's
plan to have their redemption of legal
tenders accompanied by amendments to
the banking laws, so as to enable the
banks to issue a larger volume of currency
which they will be compelled to redeem
in gold on demand. Whether the Presi
dent will make any recommendations re
garding increased revenues is uncertain,
but he will thoroughly discuss t c reve
nue situation, and will doubtless take oc
casion to point out that the principal rea
son for the failure of the present tariff law
to produce sufficient revenue 's that it has
been in operation during a period of great
business depression, when the country
was und- r the constant threat of a depre
ciated currency. '
Although an effort is to be made to pass
the Dingley tariff bill through the Senate
at the coming session, there is great dif
ference of opinion among Republicans as
to the wisdom of ."â  this - policy. Represen
tative Dalzell of Pennsylvania, one of the
Republican members of t c Committee
on Ways and Means of the House of Rep
resentatives, who was in Washington yes
terday, said he doubted whether the
Dingley bill could be pushed through the
Senate. Dalzell, who is an extreme pro
tectionist, favors having the Ways and
Means Committee ;of the House take up
the tariff question at the approaching
session and go into it with the object of
preparing a general bill which can be
practically complete by.the time the new
Congress meets either in regular or special
session.' -./ ; '
He is strongly in favor of incorporating
the reciprocity feature of the McKinley
bill m the measure, but there will be con
siderable opposition to this from 'con
servative Republicans, for the reason'that
the tendency of the reciprocity provision
* a ?~ to decrease the revenues, and the
tariff law enacted by the next Congress
must be above all else a revenue-pro
ducing measure. . â  â  "

DISCHARGED FROM
WORMWOOD JAIL
Mrs. Castle Released by
Order of the Home
O.fice.
Leaves the Prison Accompanied
by Her Husband and
a Nurse.
WILL REST IN THE COUNTRY.
Mr. Castle Expresses GratitoJe to the
Americans lor Their Sym
pathy and Assistance.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 10.â Mrs. Castle
was discharged from Wormwood Scrubbs
prison this morning. She left the prison
accompanied by her husband and a
trained nurse. She will be taken to a
country retreat until she recovers suffi
ciently to snil for America.
Bernard Abrahams, solicitor for the de
fense, received a communication from Sir
Matthew W. Ridley, Home Secretary, last
evening, stating that in consideration of
her mental condition and other circum
stances Mrs. Castle would be discharged
and restored to the care of her husband
to-day. Mr. Castle accordingly went to
the Wormwood Scrubba prison this morn
ing and took his wife away.
The receipt of the news of the decision
of the Home Offica greatly affected Mr.
Castle and had the effect of transferring
him from a condition of despondency to a
state of contentment and rest. Mr. Castle
had had .scarcely an hour's sleep since the
unexpected sentence of three months' im
prisonment imposed upon his wife until
last night.
At midnight he, in company with Soli
citor Abrahams, went to the Home Office
to arrange for the liberation of Mrs. Castle
as early as possible this morning. All
preliminary arrangements having been
completed Mr. Castle went to the prison
this morning, accompanied by a trained
nurse, and Mrs. Castle was at once placed
in a carriage and taken away.
Her physical and mental condition was
such as to make her immediate sailing for
America impossible, and for the present
she will be taken a quiet English country
retreat, where she will be kept absolutely
free from excitement.
It is officially stated at the Home Office
that after receiving reports on Mrs. Castle's
condition from Dr. Scott, the physician in
charge of the hospital at II olio way jail.
Dr. Palmenore of the Wormwood Scrubbs
prison and Dr. Nicholson ot Breaumoor
lunatic asylum, all of whom examined the
woman physically aud mentally, the
Home Secretary ordered her release, her
husband undertaking to convey her back
home to America with the least possible
delay.
Mr. Castle has conveyed to the United
Associated Presses through Solicitor
Abrahams an expression of his thoroueh
appreciation of the determined fight in be
half of Mrs. Castle and himself made by
the newspapers in America receiving
United Associated Press dispatches.
Mr. Castle further said that he was pro
hibited by his solicitors from speaking
further on tbe subject in consequence
of the desire of the English au
thorities that their action in releasing
Mrs. Castle shall obtain as little publicity
and as small a degree of discussion as pos
sible. Tbe release of Mrs. Castle is at
tributed practically to the personal in
fluence of United States Embassador
Bayard.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Nov. 10.âEm
bassador Bayard sent the following cable
gram to Secretary Olney this morning:
"Mrs. Castle released. Leaves for
America in her husband's care."

SAVED BY A BRAVE TRAMP
Plot to Wreck a Crowded Express
Train by Placing Explosives
on the Track.
Passengers Reward the Man Who Pre
vents the Disaster, but Oificers Say
He Is an Accomplice.
WASHINGTON, Ind., Nov. 10.â An at
tempt was made at 1 o'clock this morning
by robbers to ditch tbe westbound St.
Louis express on the Baltimore and Ohio
Southwestern Railway in a lonely stretch
of country east of this city.
The express-car, it is reported, contained
n large amount of money. A heavy
charge of nltro-glycerine and dynamite
was placed upon tbe track in such a way
that it would explode when struck by the
engine. A tramp named Bynkim claims
to have overheard a gang of men in a box
car plotting to wreck the train. He had
no way to signal the express train which
he knew would be due witLin a short
time. It was some distance to the nearest
switch, but he made his way there and
jerked off the signal light. His signal was
seen by the engineer of the approaching
train in time.
The train wreckers, who were in am
bush, also saw the signal, and a volley of
shot was fired at the tramp and he was
wounded in the leg and a shot grazed his
bead. The explosives were discovered and
removed from tbe track and the train
came to this city, bringing the wounded
tramp. The 200 people who were on the
train crowded about him and praised him
for his brave deed. Later a subscription
was taken up for his benefit.
Bynkim's home is in Baltimore. The
Washington police are working on a the
ory that he was one of the gang of rob
bers, but that as the train approached his
nerve failed him.

in That City.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10. â The
largest bond sale ever attempted by the
city of New York has met with success.
Bids were opened yesterday evening in
the Controller's office for the 116,046,590 70
of bonds recently advertised by the Con
troller, and the large number of bidders,
tbe prices offered and the aggregate
amount of all the bids received assures
the sale of all the bonds at figures that
will give the city a fair premium on the
lot.
Bids were received aggregating six
times the amount of the bonds, and
among them was one for the entire issue
at 104. 7 L Nearly every prominent bank in
Wall street was represented, as well as
several syndicates of bankers. But tbe
lint was chiefly remarkable for the large
number of private individuals who were
beard from. These were residents not
only of this city and Jts vicinity, but of
many parts of the country, and their bids
in many instances ranged above those of
the bankers, showing that they had taken
their gold out of their boarding places
and were looking for prime investments.
Three Children Burned to Death.
PERRINTON, Mich., Nov. 10. â The
residence of Alexander Campbell, a
farmer living four miles south of this
place, was destroyed by fire thi3 morning
and three persons were burned to death.
The building was a frame one and the

the family was aroused. Mr. and Mrs.
Campbell and one child escaped, but two
other children, aged 2 and 6 years, and
a cousin aged 19, were burned to death.

saving station has been notified that an
inspector of the Life-savinc Service will

the sailors hero who have talked with the

wreck is a true one and that what he said
was not to shield himself or to attack any
one else.
Captain Corbett's body is yet floating
with the waves. The Morgu6 has acrain

PINGREE OPPOSED TO ALGER.
It Is Given Out That Chauncey M.
Depew Does Net Want a Place
in the Cabinet
CANTON*, Ohio, Nov. 10.â Major Mc-
Kinley had a pood many visitors to-day
and has been occupied most of the time in
receiving and talking with them. Gover
nor-elect H. S. Pingree of Michigan came
from Detroit to-day to see the President
elect. He taiked for a considerable time
to Major McKmlev and told him all about
the campaign in Michigan. Incidentally
he had something to say about the avail
ability of General R. A. Algerlor a Cabinet
appointment.
Mr. Pingree did not hesitate to say to
several persons here that he was opposed
to General Alger, ami that he did not
thir.k public sentiment in Michigan was
very much arouseo in behalf of the ex-
Governor. Mr. Pingree also declared that
while he did not ttunk the Government
should discriminate against silver or any
other product of this country, he bad
never said he was in favor of free silver.
The members of the Union Medical As
sociation of Northeastern Ohio called in a
body on Muj r McKinle* this evening
and were cordially greeted fay the Presi
dent-elect. Most cf the other callers to
day were persons who had been actively
engaged in various forms of campaign
â work.
WMliam M. Hahn, wbo had charge of
the spea Jers' bureau at the National Re
publican headquarters iv Chicago, came
over from ilan>neld for a chat with Major
McKinley, and Colonel W. C. Haskell,
formerly United States Marshal for the
northern district of Ohio and sergeant-at
arnis at the Chicago headquarters. Judge
A. L. Morrison of New Mexico and Sec
retary of State Taylor of Columbus were
among Mr. McKin'ey's other visitors.
Major McKinley is hearin.r a good deal
about tbe campaign and how the victory
was won from those who were prominent
in its conduct.
Major licKinley's mother and sister
spent the afternoon with Mrs. McKinley,
who is somewhat better to-day.
Major McKinley would have had a great
many more callers this week had not the
impression that he had gone to Cleveland
gained wide currency. He expects to leave
on Thursday for a week's visit with Colonel
Myron T. Herrick.
A personal friend of Chauncey M. De
pew in this city says that he has Depew's
word for it that he will not accept a po
sition in the Cabinet if it were offered him,
and that he has no more desire to be Sec
retary of State now than he had when he
declined the appointment under President
Harrison.
HARRISON'S CONGRATULATIONS.
Hopes 31a jor JUcKinley Will Restore the
Prosperity of the Nation.
CANTON, Ohio. Nov. 14.â The follow
ing letter has been received by McKinley
from ex- President Harrison:
"The use of the mails instead of the
wires as the carrier of my congratulations
does not imply that they are less, but,
rather, that they are more thoughtful and
deliberate. It is a great honor, indeed,
when personal success is identified with a
great Natianal triumph.
"The issues forced to the front by the
Chicago platform put the fight on such
lines that the Republican party could use
the old breastworks and make an unfail
ing appeal to the patriotism of the South
as well as of the North. I sincerely hope
that you may be given the wisdom and
strength needed in this emergency to re
etore and establish the prosperity of the
Nation."
McKINLEY'S FIRM POLICE.
Election of the Major Caused Salisbury
to Stake ( 'oncensions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 10.â The
best obtainable information is that Ale-
Kinley will not neglect anything which
will contribute toward bringing about in
ternational bimetallism, and that if he
fails it will be made very evident to the
country that bimetallism is an impossibil
ity. These who are clamoring for inter
national agreement will, it is believed, be
thoroughly satisfied with the efforts that
will be made. It is understood that both
onr foreign policy and tariff policy will be
bent to the end of securing international
agreement. It is said that while there
will in no event be any abatement of the
protection policy the tariff measure will
be less unfavorable to foreign nations in
proportion to their disposition to accom
modate themselves to our financial neces
sities.
It is expected that pending foreign ques
tions the tariff and currency questions will
operate upon one another to bring about a
general settlement on equitable lines.
The announcement, by Lord Salisbury of
his belief that the Venezuelan question
would be settled to the satisfaction of all
parties is regarded as being influenced
more by the result of the election and
prospect of having to deal with the new
adminittration, if there was further delay,
than by anything that has gone before.
Up to this time it has been understood
that certain counter-propositions would be
made by Sir Julian to Mr. Oiney which
would be insisted on, and which might not
be accepted by this conntry. The latest
announcement by Loid Salisbury indi
cates that rejection of these modifica
tions of the plan proposed to Sir Julian by
Mr. Olney will not endanger a failure of
the negotiations. This is interpreted to
mean that the British Premier is disposed
to be compacent in most matters of con
tention between the two countries on the
eve of the enactment of a tariff legislation
in which England is more interested than
in anything else.
Tbere is no possibility of any tariff legis
lation contemplated being modified below
the line of complete protection, but it is
not desired by Lord Salisbury that a spirit
of hostility should be added to that of
self-preservation which will characterize
this legislation.
It is generally believed in diplomatic
circles that the Cleveland administration
will rest upon the laurels won in the set
tlement of the Venezuelan boundary dis
pue and the vindication ot the principle
of the Monroe doctrine, leaving all other
foreign issue^ for McKinley's administra
tion to handle.
Major McKinley will be called upon to
deal with both Cuba and Hawaii. It is
thought that President Cleveland will
take no action in regard to Cuba unless
something unusual and unexpected devel
ops out of the present situation. Major
McKinley's sympathies are known to be
with Cuba, therefore favorable action in
Cuba's bebalf may be expected.
As for Hawaii, annexation of the islands
by the United States is regarded as ex
tremely probable. The attitude of the Re
publicans upon thia question is well
known, and there will be no departure
Irom the position taken by the party in
the closing days of Harrison's administra
tion.

Customs Duties -Notr lieing Paid in Yel-
low Mont>y.
WASHINGTON, U. C, Nov. 10.â The
treasury ior the rirst time in several years
is receiving gold in considerable quantities
for customs duties. From this reason, and
the further fact previously mentioned in
these dispatches t>;at gold is being with
drawn from hoarding placssand deposited
in the various sub- treasuries, the gold
balance at the close of business to-day had
increase I to $122,234,315. The present
policy of the department is to discourage
the receipt of gold, as the treasury has
not on hand, without inconveniencing
itself, sufficient currency to exchange for
all the goid likely to be offered.
The present trt-asury balance is $229,803,
-000, of which (exclusive of the $122,000,000
gold) $51,853,000 is in greenbacks Â»nd $39.
-471,000 in Sherman notes. Only $13,343,
-000 in silver certificates remain in the
treasury. The continued increase in the
deficit i 3 now engaging the attention of
Secretary Carlisle and will be treated by
him in his annual report. It is rumored
that he will recommend an increase in the
tax on beer from $1 to $2 per barrel. This
proposition is said to be favored by Com
missioner Miller.
The treasury deficit for this month up
to date â one-third of the month having
passedâ is $4,453,030, making an aggregate
since July 1, 18'J5. of $37,442,000.
FIGUR OF THE INDUSTRIES.
Business Begins to Jloom all Over the
Country.
NEWARK, N. J., Nov. 10.â Business re
vivals contingent upon the election, of Mc-
Kinley are growing here. The Warwick-
Stockton Company, makers of bicycle
parts, has increased its force by 150 men
to serve surplus orders. The Heller Bros,
tile works of Forest Hill, which has been
cloaed lor a year, opened to-day with a
larger force than when they shut down
and will run overtime. Winters <)t Niles,
manufacturers of horse collars, have
doubled their force.
DAVENPORT, lowa, Nov. 10.â Things
are assuming a rosy hue in business circles
here. The Battendorf Wheel Works and
other manufactories have increased their
forces of men.
The Knostman & Peterson Furniture
Factory started up with full forces of men
Monday.
Monday morning the Rock Is-laml Plow
Company resumed operations, alter lying
idle all summer, with 200 men at work.
Most of the machine-shops and farm im
plement manufactories in Moline started
up in full blast Monday, and where idle
men could be found by hundreds during
the summer it is hard to tind a single one
now.
All banks here report heavy deposits of
gold daily and money is loaned fresly.
PAINE FOR i PORTFOLIO.
Babcock Says He Would Shine in Any
Cabinet Position.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 10.âChair
man Joseph W. Babcock of the Republi
can Congressional Committee, on his way
home from Washington, stopped over in
Milwaukee to-day.
In answer to a question as to the possi
bility of Wisconsin's getting a place in
President McKinley's Cabinet, and a
reference to the mention of his name in
that connection, Mr. Babcock said that-be
was not a candidate lor a Cabinet position,
and that if the State should be recognized
the man in direct line for the place was
Henry C. Payne, who for natural ability
and services to the party has no rival. He
said that he regarded Mr. Payne as a man
of the highest executive ability and be
lieved he would make a record for effi
ciency in any position which he might be
called upon :o fill. He was, moreover,
the only cand date from Wisconsin that
Republicans would putforward for Cabinet
appointment, if it should be intimated
that McKinley desired to call a man from
this State to sit at the Cabinet board.

Denver to Give a IHg Reception to the
>ebrashnn.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 10. â When
William J. Bryan reaches Denver Novem
ber 24 he will be greeted by such an out
pouring of the people as haa never been
witnessed west of the Missouri. The oc
casion will be made the opening of the
silver campaign of 1900. Bimetallists of
fame will be here. Invitation is
to be extended to Chairman Jones. Promi
nent men of Denver, regardless of po'iti
(R! affiliation, will join in making Mr.
Bryan feel that he is among friends who
wiil follow wherever he leads.
The Chamber of Commerce held a meet
ing to-day. and another will be hold to
morrow to complete the arrangements.
The plan is to have Mr. Bryan speak in
half a dozen balls, and if he can remain
over two days to give a parade, so that all
who cannot hear may see him.
The reception will be of National sig
nificance, as sounding the bugle for the
rally lour years hence. All ot the large
halis of the city will be opened. It is a
safe prediction to state that 100,000 visitors
will be in the city from the mountains and
the surrounding towns.
Tne men who are promoting the recep
tion are: Ex-Senator N. P. Hill, Senator
Teller. Congressman Shalrotli, E. T. Jef
lry C. S. Thomas, T. M. Patterson, E. B.
Coe and President Steele of the Chamber
of Commerce. Realizing that Mr. Bryan
has been fatiguod by the campaign, he
will be asked only to say a few words at
each meeting to the people of the common
wealth that rollad up a larger majority
for him than any other two States in the
Union.
Irregularities in Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 10.â The official
count of ba.lots cast at the recent election
to-day removed several inaccuracies. In
two or three precincts of the Tenth Ward
certain candidates were credited with
more votes than there were total ballots
cast. In the Thirteenth Precinct of th-
Ninth Ward one sheet gave Altgpid 170
votes, while the other gave him 274, and
in the Sixteenth Precinct of the same ward
there was a difference of ten in Aitgeld's
vote as recorded by the two tally lists.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1896.
ENGINEERED BY
BOLD SCHEMERS
True Inwardness of the
Appointment of a
Receiver.
The Santa Fe Road All Right
in Kansas, but Speculators
Saw a Chance.
BEARING DOWN THE STCCK.
Recent Legal Proceedings Merely a
Plot to Dabble in the Line's
Securities.
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 10.â The true in
wardness of the recent application and ap
pointment of a receiver for the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in the Dis
trict Court of Jefferson County has leaked
out.
Since the order of Judge Foster of the
Federal Court was issued restraining the
receiver from taking control and removing
the case from the State courts and the
publication of the further fact that the
alleged law under which the proceedings
were instituted was never passed by the
Legislature, but was printed in the
statutes by error, virtually rendering all
proceedings void, some of those connected
with the case have commenced to talk.
From them it is learned that the suit was
from its inception a scheme to bear the
stocks and bonds of the company and
make a lot of money for the men who
stood in with the "play."
A few days before the suit was begun in
Oskaloosa and before the recent election
two bankers of Jefferson County went to
Chicago and another to St. Louis, where
they are said to have sold heavily of Santa
Fe stocks and bonds.
Partial revival of confidence in the coun
try followed. Santa Fe secuiities went
up, and when it was telegraphed broadcast
that a receiver had been appointed in
Kansas for the railroad tbere was such a
boom all along the line that speculators
paid no attention to the reports of the re
ceivership and the "play" out here in
Kansas had no effect whatever. Instead
d 1 making money the bangers and others
who invested in the scheme lost heavily.
This is the story of the deal. A Kansas
City man of financial worth and of un
doubted standing in tnat city declares that
a few days before the action was brought
at Oskaloosa a well-known insurance arid
speculative lawyer of Topeka called on
him at Kansas City wUh a proposition
that he go in with certain Topeka and Os
kaloosa men and make $500,000.
By the terms of the proposition the Kan
sas City man was to put up the money to
be used in selling Santa Fe stocks and
bonds, but no money was to be invested
until the Kansas City capitalist should be
convinced beyond doubt that he would be
"safe."
Then the Topeka man â¢ unfolded his
pl*n. He began by stating the terms of
the Kansas alien land act, since ascer
tained to have not been passed by the
Legislature and therefore void, and the
opportunity it offered for the appointment
of a receiver for a railroad without notice
to the company. He pointed out that a
receiver could be appointed for the Santa
Fe, and persons who should be "short"
on its stocks or bonds would make big
money, for the sudden and unexpected
receivership would bear them. The Kan
sas City man doubted that a Judge could
be found in Kansas who would appoint a
receiver without notice to the company.
The Topeka man pointed out the letter
of this law and said that the Judge would
bold that notice to the company might in
terfere with the purpose of the suit and
on that ground appoint a receiver. He
suggested that the Kansas City capitalist
should put up the money in the hands of
a certain Topeka man who is known in
financial circles, to be held until the Kan
sas City man should be satisfied, the
money then to be used in selling stocks
and bonds of the company and after that
the suit should be brought and the re
ceiver appointed, but the Kansas City man
still refused to go into the scheme and nis
Topeka visitor left him, the Kansas Ci ty
man hearing no more ot the project until
it was published that Judge Myers had
appointed a receiver for the road. Tlie
events since then have been detailed in
these dispatches.
It is not impossible that the receiver
ship case may be summarily dismissed
within a few days by Attorney-General
Sawes of Kansas. It is known that he
does not consider it well founded in law
and is not in sympathy with its prosecu
tion. When questioned by the United
Associated Presses representative to-day
he saiii : "I have not yet investigated the
case to my own satisfaction. If after
thoroughly investigating it I find the case
has merits, I will prosecute it, but, if I
find the law is not sufficientâ if I find the
bringing of the suit was a great conspiracy
to line the pockets of a few men at the ex
pense of the Santa Fe road and the State,
then this suit will come to a sudden end."
BEAUTY AND THE BEASTS,
The New York Horse Show, the
Ladies and the Weil-
Groomed Men.
Brilliant Scenes on Both Sides of the
Tanbark in Mad;scn-Square
Garden.
NEW YORK. M. V., Nov. 10._Madison
square Gar.ien was thronged early to
night. The horse-show attendance exceed
ed in number^ the opening last night, the
belles and matrons of the social set occu
pying the lower tier of boxes, while in the
turong consmntly in motion along the
broad promeiju la surrounding the tan
bark were most of the well-groomed men
of the town.
In the , alleries were many of lesser note
the "plain peopl?,"to use an ante-election
phrase â and they gave most of their
attention to the ring, for the programme
of the evening was a good one. But a
large majority of the crowd devoted itself
to the beauty show in the boxes. It was
a gala night, and the costumes ware the
most brilliant shown this year.
Some of the notable people present were ;
Baron Leghatt, Belgian Minister to the
United States, ex-Governor Roswell P.
F.ower, George J. Gould, W. E. D. Stokes,
Bryce Allan, William C. Whitney, A. J.
Cassatt, Benjamin Wood, G. P. Morisini,
Elisha Dyer Jr., C. Albert Evans, E. JJ.
Morgan and ex-Secretary Benjamin F.
Tracy.
The evolutions of the mounted park
policemen made one of the interesting
features of the evening. Sergeant Eskins,
who was in command, put the horses
through their pacs amid the plaudits of
the assemblage.
The star features of the evening were
classes 101 and 50. The formerâ four mid
dle-weight green hunters â brought out a
dozen good jumpers. Their performances
over the fences aroused enthusiasm in the
galleries. Tne blue ribbon was given to
Kennett, a chestnut mare owned by S. D.
anJ L. W. R.ddle. Lucy Glitters was sec
ond and Adam Beck's Long Shot was
third.
The final event brought nineteen pair of
high -steppers into the ring. Thsy were
harnessed to very gay wagons, and were
as showy a lot of horses as has been shown
together in this country. The process of
weeding out seal such a pair as Frank
Beard s Monarch and Sensation out of the
ring. After a long trial the judges save
first honors to W. Gould BroKaw's Ruth
and Meteor, the winners of a score of blue
ribbons in iormer shows. Summaries:
The first class to be judged was for Shetland

RAN INTO A LANDSLIDE.
Wreck of a Westbound Northern Pacific
Passenger Train Causes en
Engineer's Death.
MISSOULA, Most., Nov. 10.â The west
bound Northern Pacifac passenger train,
which left here at 8:15 a. m., was wrecked
at Paradise Bluffs, seventy miles west of
here, about 11:30 o'clock this morning.
The train ran into n landslide and was
ditched. Engineer Fairchild of Missoula
was killed outright, Fireman frank Wal
don of Missoula was badly injured, Ex
press Messenger W. A. Groat of Helena is
reported badiy hurt and Mail Clerk E. F.
Goodhue of Helena is reported missing.
Superintendent E. J. Pierson, Master
Mechanic W. S. Clarkson and physicians
left for the srene shortly after 1 p. m. with
a wrecking train.
Reports claim that eight passengers are
either killed or injured. This is denied at
division headquarters.
The accident was caused by a rockslide
that had come down from a high bluff
near the track and had blocked the way.
The engine struck the rock and was up
set. Fairchild went with it and was
crushed. The tender left the track on the
other side and took with it the mail, ex
press and baggage cars, which were upset,
and an emigrant coach, which left the
trails, beii:g burned up. The emigrant
car was empty, and ibe men in the cars
ahead escaped without injury. A wreck
age outfit was immediately sent out from
here, and the track will be cleared by
morning.
Many wild reports went out immedi
ately after the accident, some placing the
number of killed and wounded at a high
figure. Express - messenger E. F. Good
hue was reported missing, but has turned
up all right
DARING SHOPLIFTERS CAUGHT.
Fifteen Thousand Dollars' Worth of Goods
Stolen From Department- Stores by
a Clever Trio
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 10.â William
Schoel (alias Seharf), Honry Bauer and
his wife and Mame Delmont, an alleged
gang of New York shoplifters, are under
arrest in this city. The quartet, it Is
claimed, has been doing systematic rob
bery in the dtate-street department-stores
for more than a year, and are believed to
have accumulated $15,0<J0 worth of mer
chandise, including lurs, jewelry, silks
and all kinds of wearing apparel. The
greater portion of the plunder has been
sent to Eastern cities, where it was dis
posed of.
Schoel was arrested yesterday and re
leased on bond to-day. Detectives
shadowed him to the rooms of his com
panions on Washington street, where
they arrested the remainder of the gang
and recovered about $600 worth of stolen
goods. Express receipts showing ship
ments of about $8000 worth of property to
New York and other Eastern cities within
the past two months were found in Bauer'a
trunk. They claim to have come 'here
from New York a year ago.

AN ARBITRATION
TREATY ARRANGED
Settlement of Venezuelan
Boundary Disputes to
Follow.
Plen : potent' aries Are Preparing
tne Proposed Protocol at
Washington.
OLNEY GAINS CONCESSIONS.
Fifty Years of Undisputed Residence
Shall Give the Right of
Fossession.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 10.â Every
indication points to the probability that
within the next fifteen or twenty days Sir
Julian Pauncefote and Secretary Olney,
plenipotentiaries appointed for that pur
pose by their respective Governments,
may be able to sign here in Washington
the protocol of a proposed treaty, to be
subsequently submitted to their respect
ive Governments for approval, which will
include in its provisions a method of ar
bitrating the boundary line between
Venezuela and British G.iiana.
The exact terms of this important con
vention are not yet definitely settledâ far
less signed. On the contrary, verbal
changes are continually being suggested
and agreed upon .or modified by cable
messages between the plenipotentiaries
and the British Foreign Office.
But that the essential basis of the treaty
has been agreed upon is made clear in the
correspondencewhicn Secretary Olney to
day felt justified in making public after
Lord Salisbury's speech at the London
Mansion House last night.
Tlie basis agreed on is that in the "set
tled district" a term of fifty years of un
disputed residence sha'l be considered as
giving the right to possession. The ac
ceptance of this condition by England is
regarded as a distinct concession, inas
much as it brings under the award of the
arbitration tribunal (which is to consistof
five distinguished persons not citizens of
any American State) all the districts
which have been settled since the cele
brated Sctiomburgk line was drawn in
1840.
It may take some days further to arrange
details as to time and place of meeting of
the tribunal and as to the selection of the
arbitrator.-, but there is every reason to
believe that the President may be able to
announce to Congress when it meets in
December next the signing of the pre
liminary protocol and to submit it to the
Senate for ratification.
That this is a strong probability is made
clear by the announcement authorized by
the Venezuelan Commission to-day that it
will suspend the preparation of its report
for the present, but will proceed with the
compilation of the important data it has
collected.
Tlie King of Sweden and Norway. Oscar
11, ha? been chosen by treaty between the
United States and Great Britain as the
fifth arbitrator of the boundary question.
The other arbitrators, four in number, are
to be designated â two by the Lord Chief
Justice of England and two by the Chief
Justice of tbe United States Supreme
Court. This is tbe final and most impor
tant feature of the treaty for the complete
adjustment of the long-impending Vene
zuelan controversy.
As a King seldom leaves his country ex
cept on state visits to other sovereigns it
is not expected that King Oscar II will go
outside of Sweden for the meeting of the
arbitrators, and the court is likely to sit
at Stockholm, the capital of Sweden,
where King Oscar's palace and tbe Halls
of the Swedish Reksdag are located.
EXCHANGE OF LETTERS.
Correspondence â¢ 1 hat Patted Between
Olney and Salisbury;
WASHINGTON, 'D. C. Nov. 10.â Two
letters which were exchanged between the
United States and Great Britain regard
ing Venezuela since the presentation of
Mr. Olney's counter proposition of June
12, were given to the press at the State
Department this afternoon, and help ma
terially to clear up the situation. In a
dispatch of May 22, 1896, Lord Salisbury
had proposed an evenly divided commis
sion to report upon the 1 territory in dis
pute outside the so-called settled districts,
and Secretary Olney bail suggested the
provision quoted . heretofore in these dis
patches for a commission of unequal num
bers. ,
The next dispatch was from Lord Salis
bury to Sir Julian Pauncefote. It bears
date of July 3, and referring to Mr. Olney's
argument that "it appears to be a funda
mental condition that the boundary line
decided to be the true one by the arbitra
tors shall not cperate upon territory bona
fide occupied by a British subject â shall
be deflec ed in every case so as to make
such territory part of British Guiana."
Lord Salisbury declares this was not
the intention of his prop< sals, which
were that "the tribunal should not have
power to include such districts as the ter
ritory of Venezuela," but he did not pro
pose that they should necessarily be as
sumed without further proof to be part of
British Guiana. "I only stipulated,"
writes Lord Salisbury, "that the owner
ship of them was not to be decided by the
tribunal, which in our judgment was in
adequate for this purpose, though it was
adequate lor the assignment of the un
settled districts. The settled districts
shown to be in dispute by the inquiries of
the commission were to be disposed of by
subsequent negotiation. The claim of
Venezuela is so far reaching that it brings
into question interests aud rights which
cannot properly be disposed of by an un
restricted arbitration. It extends as far
as the Essequibo; it covers two-thirds of
the colony of British Guiana; it im
peaches titles which have been unques
tioned for many generations."
Continuing farther Lord Salisbury
wrote :
"The view of her Majesty's Government
is that where the matter in issue is of
great importance and involves rights
which belong to a considerable populati n
and are deeply cherished by them special
precautions against any miscarriage of jus
tice are required, of which I have indi
cated the general character in this corre
spondence, but which are not required
where a title to unoccupied territory is
alone an issue. It ;s for this reason that
her Majesty's Government proposed to
except these districts from the jurisdiction
of the arbitration tribunal, though it could
deal adequately with the disputed claims
to territory that is not occupied. But
they did not intend by that stipulation to
ask the Government of the United States
to prejudice any questions which had
been raised or might be raised with re
spect to the ownership of settled districts.
This part of the subject, confessedly the
most difficult part, would iiave been re
served lor separate examination."
Secretary Olney, in reply to this letter
referring briefly to that pait of Lord Salis
bury's letter intended to make clear his
meaning in the dispatch of May 22, is more
pointed concerning the references to the
fnr-reaching claim of Venezuela. Secre
tary Olney says:
"That Venezuela claims territory ex
tending into the Essequibo, or covering
two-thirds of the colony of British Guiana,
cannot be regarded as being of itself an
insuperable obstacle to unrestricted arbi
tration, but the objection that the Vene
zuela claim 'impeaches titles that have
been unquestioned for many generations'
is undoubtedly of the most weighty char
acter. The inquiry I desire to put, there
fore, is this: Can it be assumed that her
Majesty's Government would submit to
unrestricted arbitration on the whole of
the territory in dispute, provided it
be a rale of the arbitration, em
bodied in the arbitral agreement that
territory which has been in the exclusive,
notorious and actual use and occupation
of either party for two generations, cr say
for sixty years, shall be held by the arbi
trators to be the territory of such party?
In other words, will her Majesty's Gov
ernment assent to unrestricted arbitration
of all the territory in controversy v.ith the
period for the acquisition of title by Dre
scrip.ion fixed by agreement of the par
ties in -advance at sixty years?"
The concluding suggestion of Secretary
Olney for sixty years as the period for ac
quisition of title to property led to a
counter proposal from Lord Salisbury to
reduce the time to twenty years, which
was the term common in the United
State?, or to twenty-one years, which was
common law in England. Venezuela,
however, would not consent to this, nor
did Secretary Olney entertain the sugges
tion for such a reduction. Considerable
discussion finally resulted in a virtual
agreement on fifty years as tbe period.
Fifty years would fully satisfy Venezuela,
and would practically make the arbitra
tion unrestricted, as nearly all the British
aggr ssions have taken place since that
time, Schomburgk's line having been
drawn wholly within that period.
DO NOT C REDIT THE STORY.
New York Capitalints Know Nothing of
the New Tranx-Faeifle Ltne.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10.â A dis
patch from San Francisco to the effect
that a new trans-Pacific steamship line
is to be built was published here to-day.
Among those interested, the dispatch
said, were E. C. Potter & Co. of this city.
The firm named are members of the New
York Stock Exchange, and intimately
connected with the sugar refining inter
ests. Upon inquiry at the office of the
firm, it was learned* that the concern had
nothing whatever to do with the new
scheme, and, in fact, had never heard of
of it. C. P. Huntington of the Pacific
Steamship Company, when asked about j
the matter, stated that it was news to him '
and that he did not credit the report
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov. 10. -a

Son., the shipbuilders of this city, who
was called on this afternoon relative to
the story published under a San Francisco
date to the effect that they with other
American capitalists and business men
would establish a steamship line on the
Pacific, said that the firm knew nothing
whatever of the project, and in fact had
never heard of it.

Remarkable State of Affairs
Presented in the National
Farmers' Congress.
REMONSTRANCE TO BE MAD:.
Agricultural Department Miy Bs
Demanded to Make an
Investigation.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ixd., Nov. 10 âAbout
200 tanners from various parts of the coun
try met in the hall of Representatives in
j the Statehouse to-day to attend the six
teenth annual session of the National
Farmers' Congress. Colonel B. F. Ciayton
of lowa, president of tha organization,
was in the chair.
The morningsession was devoted entire
ly to address*.*. Mayor Tagg at welcomed
the Congress on behalf of the city, J. C.
Offett of Trafalgar on behalf of the farm
ers of the State, and Governor Matthews
on behalf o? the State. Colonel Clayton
delivered the president's address, and i:i
the course of it gave the keynote for dis
cussion in the following paragraph:
'â¢During the last hsca: year of the opera
tions of the former tariff law the agricul
tural imports in twenty articles, the like
of which we produc north and south,
amounted to $65,804,416. D.iring the first
calendar year of tbe operation of the pres
ent law the importation of the same arti
cles amounted to $135,068,860, or an in
crease over the former law of $68,364,314.
In the exportation of farm products we
find the discrepancy still greater in
twenty-seven chief articles produced on
the farm. Dnring the fiscal year 1894 we
exported farm products to the amoutit of
$907,946,945, while during the calendar
! year 1895 thero were exports in the same
| produds to i lie amount of $751,833,937, a
decrease of $156,113,000.
"Adding the gain in imports to the loss
in exports, the American farmers'
losses in one year were $224,337,322. If
these figures be true a vigorous remon-
Btrance to these schedules should go up
and we ehouid demand that the Agr:cult
i ural Department investigate each item.
j Should protection be the policy of the
I Government, then it should be apnhed to
I farm products and the Agricultural De
j partment should recommend to the Gen
eral Government such changes in tariff
schedules as will furnish equal protectiou
to the products of the farm."

Barlow Leads McLachlan on Semi-
Official Count in the
Sixth.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 10.â The
official count on the tally sheets of the
late election returns by the Board of Su- j
pervisors of this county is far from com
plete. Considerable urogre3B was made
to-day, however, and it is expected that
the count will be completed for the entire
couuty by to-morrow night. Very few
errors of importance were found to-day,
so the vote as heretofore returned for the
electoral, county and district candidat-.-s
remains substantially us given to the
press.
In the Congressional fight Barlow hed j
ten votes added to his column as a re:-uu
of errors in footings. This will cut no fig
ure in the result, unles3 other errors in
bis favor are d scovered.
McLachlan hus information which leads
him to look to a number of couniy pre
cincts for an increased vote as the result
of errors in the tally sheets. Most of the
board's time to-day has been occupied
with this city's precinct returns, which
wtre mainly found to be in regular lorm
and generally without errors of any kind.
Precinct 12 was rejected by the board
and not counted at all, owing to irregular
ity and unlawful folding of all the ballots.
This caused a loss to the Bryan electors
and to Barlow of 23 votes, and if these are
finally rejected altogether, Barlow's net
loss for the day's count will be 13.
None of the numerous watchers of the
count have made objections to the rulings
of tlie board where irregularities have been
discovered, and there:ore everything is
apparently progressing satisfactorily to
all parties.
Official returns have been received from
all counties, except Los Angeles, in the
Sixth District. The unofficial figures for
Los Angeles gave McLachlan a plurality
of 378 votes. Using tr.ose figures in the

FLED FROM WOODLAND,
Philip Collum Fails to Appear
for Trial oa a Charge of
Arscn
His BAI Is Declared Forfeited and
the Court Issues a Bsnch
Warrant.
WOODLAND, Cal., Nov. 10.â The trial
of the People vs. Charles Shepherd and
Philip Collum on a charge of arson for
causing the destruction of the Woodland
Woolen-mills on the night of January 28
of this year was called before Judge Grant
in the Superior Court this morning.
When the court inquired if all were ready
to proceed the attorney for the defense
rose and stated that Collum wag absent.
The Sheriff was instructed to call for him,
but no response came. His bail of $1500
was declared forfeited and a bench war
rant was issued for his apprehension.
Collum was released on bail, against the
protest of District Attorney Hopkins, who
declared that the bond was worthless, as
the sureties were not worth the amount
qualified for. The District Attorney will
begin immediately to enforce collection
from the solvent sureties. AUorney Hop
kins received a letter a short time ago
signed by Philip Collum and postmarked
Rhode Isiatid, in which he said that he
could not appear for trial becauso of the
illness of his fatner and that he was inno
cent.
He pleaded with the District Attorney
to dismiss the case. Shepherd denounces
Collum's desertion as a cowardly act and
says he will aid the authorities in bringing
him back to justice.
The remainder of the day was occupied in

A Woman Prisoner United
in Marriage to Her
Accuser.
Novel Method of Defeating Jus
tice on the Day of Her
Trial.
WAS CHARGED WITH ROBBERY-
After Her Incarceration She Won the
Prosecuting Witness' Heart
a: d Hand.
SEATTLE, Waph., Nov. 10.â Mary Mc-
Devitt, better known to thÂ« police of Seat
tle and San P'rancisco &i Essie Winters,
had a round with Seattle juetice to-day
and Seattle justice is groggy. Since Sep
tember 23 she has been held in the Kings
County jail awaiting trial for robbery, but
this afternoon, while still 11 prisoner, she
accepted the star witness against her as
her husband. Ur.uer the law^ of this
State a husband cannot testify against his
wife or the wife asninst her husband.
Consequently thcrÂ« will be but one thing
left for the prosecuting attorney to do and
that will be to dismiss the action against
the woman. The case is one of the most
remarkable that ever came to the atten
tion of the po.:ce of this city.
Essie Winters has made her home in
this city. That is not her real name, bat
she assume 1 it ten years ago, when she
left the home of her father, a wealthy
White River farmer, and came to the city
to live. She fell among theatrical men
and went to California for a time. At one
time she was reputed to be worth $100,
-000. For a year past she has resided in
tbis city.
About one month ago Steven J. Overton
was robbed of several hundred dollars in
the southern part of the city. He was a
miner and had just come back from
Alaska. He told the police that a woman
had relieved him of his money. The police
suspecte-i Essie Winters and an officer
went in search of her. He met her on tbe
street. When she saw the officer she gave
a man named R. J. Gould a purse con
taining what is beiieved to have been
Overton's money. Gould took it and
started to run. '1 he officer shot at him.
Gould threw the purse into a pool of water
and it was t.ever recovered.
The woman and Gould were arrested.
They confessed, and both were bound
over to the Superior Court.
Overton visiied tue woman in prison
and became infatuated. His visits be
came frequent, and after each he would
urge tbe police not to pu3ii the case. The
police said that the woman and Gould
had to be punished. The woman wrote
several notes to Overton whiie in jail and
he answered them. Every visiting day
he called and brought her daintiea.
To-day he showed up at the County Jail
with a treacher, and with the consent of
the Sheriff they were married. Six con
victs were present and witnessed the cere
mony.
After that the woman went back to her
Cell and Overton, with the curses of the
police heaped upon, went bacic to a posi
tion he is filling. He asserts that he loves
the woman and that she loves him, but
the police say that the woman and Gould
have conspired to escape prosecution, and
that as soon as the case against them is
dismissed they will go away and leave
Overton.

BERLISER MICKOPHONE PATENT
Highta of the Government and the Btll
' ompnnt/ Argued.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 10.-R. S.
Taylor in the Supreme Court of the
United States to-d h y continued the ooen
mg argument for the Government in'the
suit to cancel the Berliner microphone
patent owned by the Bell Telephone Com
pany. Passing over the office records of
the application made by Mr. Berliner from
the date of its filing, 1877, to 1882 as to
which period the Government made no
particular criticism, he reviewed at length
the history of the case from 1882 to 1883, a
period of six years, during which, he as
serted, the Bell Company made no effort
to secure the issuing of the patent. This
delay, Mr. Taylor contended, was founded
r.pon an illegal assumption by the officials
of tbe Patent Office that they had no
power to issue the Berliner patent until
the contest between Daniel Drawbaugh.
one of whose cl.'iims antagonized Berlin!
er's, and the office was concluded. Mr.
Taylor spoke nearly four hours.
Tue case for the Bell Telephome Com
pany was presented by Ferdinand P. Fish
of Boston. It was absurd, he said, to as
sert that the Bell Company desired delay
in the issue of the patent, for until the de
cision of the Supreme Court in the suit
decided in 18S7 there was not a moment
that the officials of the Beil Company were
not careitil that their monopoly of the
telephone business would be overthrown.
Mr. Fish will resume his argument to
morrow, and will be followed by Joseph
H. Choute of New YorJr for the Bell Com
pany, and by Caustin Krowne, who will
close the argument for the United States.

A REVIVED SAILOR
A Seaman's Toast Fol-

Memories.
GOT IN THE NAVY AT LAST.
Strict Medical Examination
Floors Him to Begin
With.
One of the better class of water-front re-
sorts was crowded not long since with a
host of "bluejackets," who were enjoying
themselves in their own peculiar and yet
altogether legitimate way. One tall,
handsome man, who showed a form that
any athlete might be proud of, was ap-
parently looked up to as something of a
leader, and he it was who suggested the
names of most of the singers and speech-
makers, and when the motion to adjourn
was made he put it. But it wasn't car-
ried. 1 here was a suggestion that be give
a toast (which it was afterward learned
he had given once or twice before), and so
i "to keep the peace." as he put it, he be-
gan. It was indeed nautical to a degree
It is too long to reproduce here, but he
toasted father, mother, sisters and brothers
in a most original way. This is how he
proposed the mother's health: â -".'â 
"^â¢u 11 here's to motherâ 'first rate' sheâ
Â« ho launched me on life's stormy sea
And rigged me fore and aft '
May Providence her timbers spare
And keep her hull in good repair
To tow the smaller craft
The cheers which greeted him were
enough to show he was a great favorite
with "all hands." He was seen afterward
by a reporter, and when asked as to hiu
length of time in the service and so on he
said: "1 am afraid that you wouldn't
have called me much of a tine manor a
fine talker, either, sir, a few months before
I entered the service. You can believe
me or not, but it is the fact that I was
once rejected for the navy on account of
physical weakness." And then he told
something about himself. He' said: '*!
came down here from Oregon, and was
awful weak and what snore people call
â¢played out,', and I tried to get at what
was ailing me. but I couldn't. One day
one of the doctors that I went to see told
me to go to seaâ that was the only chance
left for me. Well, I tried to get into the
navy, but, as I tell you, I was rejected."
".Well, but you are there now,' ' was sug-
gested. ' Â°
â¢â "T? 1 .* 1 !: kn *"- he renlied, -'but I
wouldn't be but for the doctors of that
great Hudson Medical Institute up there
on the corner of Market, ; Stockton and
Ellis street* Why, I thought I was just
dying when I went up there, but they took
me by the hand, said they would pull ma
out O X, and in four months I applied
again to the service, and here I amâ
bripht, sound and chipper as a dollar."
"Well, what did these doctors do to
revive yon in this remarkable way?"
"The principal thing they did was to
give me their preparation called 'Hud-
yan.' and after what it did for me you can
gamble your last cent 1 am never without
it nowâ not that lev-r take it any more

: "I tell yon," he concluded, "that's a

ITS OBSERVATORY
Telescopes and Machinery
Will Be Removed
to Mexico.
The Astronomers Believe Better
Observations Can There
Be Secured.
PLANS FCK NEW RESEARCHES.
Di mantlirg of a Vantage Point That
Has Added Much to Human
Knowledge.
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Nov. 10.â The Low
ell astronomical observatory, which was
established here in 1894 for the study of
the plaiu-ts, and especially Mars, is in pro
cess of removal to the City of Mexico.
The lenses of the great telescope have
I een removed and the machinery is being
:.ken down, to be shipped to the City of
Mexico in a few days. The object in go
ing south is to secure better observation
during the winter months, aud the experts
wno have studied the question say this
can be done on the Mexican plateau,
which lies within the tropics and has an
elevation of about 8000 feet above the sea
lereL
The observatory was in active operation
here during 1894 and 1895, and many hun
dreds of fine drawings were made of Mars,
the result showing that our neignhoring
pianet is covered by an extensive system
o: canals, arranged in an artificial way as
though the work of intelligent beings.
These researches were made by Professors
Lowell, Pickering and Douglass and have
attained world-vside celebrity.
Professor Lowell's discoveries induced
him io order a new 24-inch telescope from
â¢ Aivan Clark & Sons with a view of prose
cutin^ these studies stili further.
The new telescope hns been in use here
since August, 1896, and many new discov
eries have been made. ThÂ« work has
been centered upon the planets and
southern doubie stars. Professors Lowell
and Douglass have continued their obser
vation ot Mars, while Professor Lowell
;;nd Mr. Drew have worked on Mercury
and Venus during the daytime. In the
cii ar air of the afternoon these planets
have shown conspicuous markings, and
the astronomers have been able not
nirrely to make maps of their surfaces,
but to prove conclusively that the bodies
rotate once only the course of a revolu
ti n about the sun. One face of the planet
is therefore turned toward the sun and
heated to an immense temperature while
the other is wrapped in everlasting night.
The markines drawn by Lowell have
seitled the question of the rotation
cf Mercury and Venus, which had been
partially studied by Schiaparelli some
3 T ears ago. Mr. Lowell finds that Mercury
has no appreciable atmosphere while
Venus naa an abundance of it but for
some reason it DOtseases only a very few
clouds. Drawings of its markings have
been forwarded to the Royal Astronomi
cal Society in London.
Dr. T. J. J. See and Mr. Cogshall have
used the new telescope on the southern
double stars, and it is announced to-day
that since August 1 they have discovered
150 new stellar systems, besides measuring
100 stars recognized by previous observers.
In Mexico, Dr. See will continue his
sweeps for new doubie stars, and in this
more southern latitude opportunity for
new discoveries will be especially good.
No important work on the double stars of
the southern heavens has been done since
the survey of Sir John Herschel, sixty
years a^-o. The plan is to sweep over the
whole of the unknown region of the sky
about the south pole, and it is believed
that hundreds of new twin stars will be
found.
The Mexican Government is keenly alive
to the importance of this scientific expe
dition, and President Diaz has not only
â  welcomed the American astronomers, but
has instructed the Mexican National Ob
servatory to furnish every possible aid to
them in their work. It is said that the
â¢ expedition will prove the most important
scientific enterprise of tbia century.
TEN YEA RS AND FIVE MONTHS.
â¢ Sentence of Treasurer George Morrison,
Who Pleaded Guilty of Looting a
County's Strongbox.
TROY, N. V., Nov. io.â ln the Supreme
Court today ex-County Treasurer George
Morrison was sentenced to ten years and
five months' imprisonment on his plea of
guilty to charges of embezzling funds of
the county. Mr. Morrison, prior to the
first week in October, was Treasurer of
Rensselaer County.
Immediately after the closing of the
doors of the National Bank of Trey, of
which he was cashier, rumors affecting
the solvency of Mr. Morrison and the
management of the County treasurership
became prevalent. He subsequently
transferred to his bondsmen all his real
<md personal property, valued at about
$190,000. On tne day of the transfer Mr.
Morrison was taken into custody on a
warrant charging grand larceny in mis
appropriating about $20,000 due the city of
Troy for money collected under the
Raines law. He was bailed on this
charge, the bond being $4000.
A dny or two later, as a result of inves
tigation of the County Treasurer's ac
(ountsby the Board of Supervisors, he
was again arrested on a charge of grand
larceny in misapproi riatine about $250,
-000 of county funds. He was indic.ed by
a Grand Jury two weeks ago and his trial
was begun to-dny and seven jurors had
been obtained wt en court aajourned for
noon recess. For a day or two rumors
had been current that he would plea<i
puilty, and at the opening of the court
this afternoon this course was taken. The
specific indictments on which he was sen
tenced were for refusing to pay his succes
sor as County Treasurer two distinct sums
of money.
"DOLLAR WHEAT" IN SIGHT.
Shortage of the Argentine Crop Causes
the Prices to Run Up at
New York.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10.â "Dollar
wheat" appears to be in sight and the
i>rospect is that the flow of gold from
Europe will soon be resumed. Cash wheat
No. 2 red, the standard grade, sold to-day
p.t 94 cents a bushel. On August 24 last
it sold at 64 cents. The gain therefore in
less than three months has been 30 cents
a bushel. The chief dealings to-day as
for some time, were in December wheat,
or in other words, in wheat delivered in
December.
The opening price was Sl% cents, or 1%
cents above the closing price of Monday.
The low price of the Say was 87 1-16 cents
on a '"split sale"; the highest pries was 89
cents and the final price was 88% cents,
or 2% cents above the tinal price of Mon
day. The high price previous to Monday
for December wheat was 86 9-16 cents on a
"split sale" on October 19.
A potent factor in moving up wheat was
a dispatch lrom Rosario saying that lo
custs had already destroyed one-third of
the Argentine wheat crop and were still
doing damage. In addition there was in
formation that the drought continued in
India and Australia.
STANFORD VARSITY WINS.
Reliance Fails to Score in the Practice
Game With the Palo Alto
Football Men.
PALO ALTO, Cal., Nov. 10â Stanford
Varsity lined up against Reliance this
afternoon in a practice game, and kept the
Onklanders from scoring. Stanford made
long gains at first through the Reliance
line, the work of Fickert at interference
being specially strong. His interference
made it possible lor Seawright to make
long gains. Cotton played fullback and
his work was of the "star" order. Cotton
made hrst touchdown from the 30-yard
line seven minutes aftÂ«r play began.
Carle and Fisher worked especially well
together. Straight fliade one of the long
est runs to-day by unaided efforts.
After the second kick-off Stanford never
lost the ball till she made the second
ouchdown. No goals were tried. The men
i"ere changed frequently by both siaes
throughout the game. B. Thomas played
strongly and Freeman, when tried at full
back, bucked and punted well. Dole at
left half proved unusually strong at buck
ing. ,He has not been able to play in
practice recently, hence his performance
is all the more noticeable.
For Reliance Arlett and Sexton did the
best wor>, but the tries at the Stanford
line were absolutely useless.
B. Tiiomas made the third down for
Stanford utter twenty-five minutes' play.
Late in the second half Dole made a pretty
30-yard end run, carrying the bail to the
Reliance 15 yard line. Fisher and Thomas
earned the ball over.
Lacuna made several pretty tackles for
Reliance. Cotton and Fisher were entitled
to more i ard line bucking than any other
two men on the tieid. 0. Thomas played
s;rong tackle in Cotton's old position. A
nfm touchdown was made before lime was
finally called. Score, 20 to 0.
PILLBURY COMING HOME.
The Great Cheaa I'lnyrr Talks About
Future Tournaments.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 10.â A represen
tative of the United Associated Presses
had an interview to-day with Henry N.
Pillsbury of Brooklyn, N. V., the Ameri
can chess expert, who is in London on his
way back to America from the Continent,
where ..e has been playing, having taken
part iv the recent chess tournaments he.d
in Nuremburg and Budapest
Mr. Piilsbury said he would not chal
lenge Showalter, but if Showalter should
challenge, he would play, not for the title
of chamnion, but for money, any amount
over $1000; anywhere and at any time
afier tbe eii)iri\tion of two months. The
next chess match by cabie between the
representative players of America and
Great Britain, Mr. Pilisbury said, would
be much more interesting ttian the
previous one, in consequence of the fact
that there would be two additional players
on each side.
America, ne added, would have to play
the best team that could possibly be got
together in order to df feud tike trophy, as
England would make special effort's to
win it,
"The time has arrived," Mr. Pillsbury
said, "to hold an interr.ationhl chess tour
nament in the United Slates, exceeding in
importance anything of the Kind that has
ever been held. In my opinion a double
round tournament with eiÂ«h enn of the
best European players offering to partici
pate, the loreign players to receive the
full sum oi their expenses, would bi the
best plan. I would suggest that if Boston
and Philadelphia contribute pecuniary
aid to the scheme a portion of the games
of the tournament be played in those
cities."
Mr. Pillsbury will sail for New York on
boara the steamer St. Louis on Saturday,
and will take a two months' rest at home.

THE STRANDED ST. PAUL BEFORE IT WENT TO PIECES.
PACIFIC GROVE, L'al.. Nov. 10.â The steamer St. Paul, which crashed on the rocks near Point Pinos during a fog
in Aupust last and which broke to pieces a few days ago, is being carted high and dry on the beach and hauled away by
the Del Alonte work teams. The management of the Hotel del Monte does not own the wrecK, but it does own the prop
erty lying adjacent, and claims the wreckage as it comes in. Abner Bassett, who purchased the steamship for $30. had
perfected arrangement?, and was all ready to save considerable from the doomed vessel. He was to begin operations in a
day or two. The craft went to piecps before he got ready, and now the Pacific Improvement Company claims all the
wreckage as driftwood, even to several Kegs of rum which floated ashore.

One of the Prisoners the Father of
the Young M n Captured
on Monday
CAHTO, Cal., Nov. 10.â A second posse
of man-hunters returned to Usal to-night
after a four days' exciting chase, having in
charge George Ferguson and John Dodge
Sr., the lat'.er father of the young Dodge
apprehended yesterday. Noble and Smith
I are still at liberty, but are being closely
followed by a posse in charge of Deputy
Sheriff Hart and all of the men suspected
of the murder of Rancher Mudgett are ex
pected to De jailed to-morrow night.
Ferguson and Dodge Sr. were brought
in by Deputy Sheriff Hart and others con
! nected with the pursuit and placed in the
, jail. Soon a hundred people congregated
about the jail and in the hallways leading
to it to gain the latest information from
within.
Tue doors to the chief officer's office
were locked, and only a few were admit
ted, and when any of those who were for
tunat? enough to gain an entrance retired
they were plied with all manner of ques
tions. From information gleaned from
I Under Sheriff Handy, it is believed that
the Dodees were the prime movers in the
plot for the killing of Mudgett and the
burning of his property. All the officers
declined to permit any one to see the
| prisoners outside their attorneys.
The posse of man-hunters left Usal last
Saturday, going north to Island Moun
tain, thence to the Trinity County line
and east to the Yollo Bolle range. Here
the fugitives had taken to the shrubby
foothills, returning to Inland Mountain
again. The posse separated hereafter the
capture of Dodge Jr. and wife, who
were escorted back to Usal by Sheriff
Handy. The remaining branch, in charge
of Officer Hart, continued the search for
the other fugitives. Gorge and canyon
were thoroughly explored. No one can
have a just appreciation of what the offi
cers were called upon to undergo until he
has traveled over chemisal mountains,
going through places where a grizzly bear
would scarce attempt to foice its way.
Live Dodge Jr. and his wife Ferguson
and the senior Dodge surrendered without
the slightest resistance. The outlaws
were camped in a grewsome spot in the
forest. Their campfire scarcely showed
through the impenetrable underbrush,
but one of the men stumbled on it, and
the suspects were surrounded before aware
that danger was near.

TACOMA CRANK
ENDS TWO LIVES
Doctor J. S. Wintermuth
Killed by Samuel
Tucker.
The Murder Quickly Followed
by the Suicide of the
Assassin.
TEAGEDT ON EAILEOAD STREET
A Weak-Minied Invalid's Revenge
for What He Claimed Was
Malpractice.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 10.â Dr. J. 8.
Wintermuth, a prominent physician of
this city, was shot and fatally wounded by
Samuel S. Tucker on Railroad street at 10
o'clock this morning. Tucker after shoot
ing Wintermuth placed tne muzzle of his
revolver against his own head and blew
out his brains. The doctor died at lo'clock
this afternoon at the Fannie Paddock
Hospital.
\Vitnesse* of the tragedy say that Tucker
accused Dr. Wintermuth, who had been
treating him, ot malpractice, and without
further ado drew a revolver and fired.
Tucker was subject to fits of insanity, and
had been arrested while mentally unsound
two years ago.
Dr. Wintermuth was conscious for an
hour and a half after the shooting, until
put on an operating-table. An exami
nation showed that the bullet entered the
left side of his spine, four inches below
the lower ribs, passed through the trans
verse processes of the spine and severed
two intestines, lodging; in the fat in front
of the abdomen. Death was caused by
internal hemorrhage. Tne victim knew
he was doomed, but had hope to the last.
Tucker died within live minutes after
he placed the pistol to his head. His
body was removed to the morgue. He
had no known relatives hereabouts.
Tucker had been brooding for the last two
weeks and made several threats against
the doctor's life. He claimed that while
under medical treatment he had not been
given fair treatment.
Dr. J. S. Wintermutn, who was shot and
fatally wounded by S. 8. Tucker in Ta
coma yesterday morning, was a brother
in-law of F. K. Lane, an attorney, who re
sides in this City, at 1714 Pacific avenue.
He was also a nephew of E. Stinson, a
Chicago capitalist, and stockholder in the
Central Pacific Railroad.
He was professor of surgery in the
Tacoma dental college, regent of the
Washington State University, ex-vice
president of the Washington Medical Soci
ety and physician and surgeon of the
Fannie Paddocfc Hospital.
HENSHAW IS INSPECTOR
Colonel Sperry's Resignation Was
Not Accepted and He Was
Dismissed.
The State Executive Does Not Desire
to Di ru-s the Affair at the
Present Time.
The resignation of George B. Sperry of
Stockton, colonel and insppctor-general of
rifle practice staff, of Governor Budd, was
not accepted by the comniander-in-chief
of the National Guara of California. The
Governor, however, revoked Colonel
Sperry's commission and appointed Park
Henshaw to nil the position of inspector
of rifle practice. Colonel Henshaw com
manded the Eighth Infantry Regiment,
N. G. C, befor the reorganization of the
guard, and is one of the best officers in the
Slate. He brought his regiment forward
to a high degree of efficiency.
The Governor speaks with some reluc
tance about the incident of Colonel
Sperry's dismissal. When asked yester
day if Colonel Sperry was not still an offi
cer of the National Guard, notwithstand
ing his removal from staff duty, the
Governor replied: "He is no longer an
officer of the National Guard. He was re
moved for cause and another officer ap
pointed in his place. I apDointed Colonel
Park Henshaw of Chico. Ido not care to
discuss the subject for publication."
LODGE DOCTORS
CHAMPIONED
The County Medical Society-
Has Voted in Their
Favor.
Dr. C. G. Kuhlman's Resolutions
Rejected by That
Body.
SOME STRONG STATEMENTS.
Kuhlman Does Not Despair â 0 ficers
Elected for the Coming
Year.
The County Medical Society held a
stormy session last night in the Shiels
bui ding, 32 O'Farrell street. It was all
owinsr to the resolution of Dr. Charles G.
Kuhiman in regard to lodge physicians,
coming up for a second reading. The
resolution was not adopted, in spite of the
efforts made in its behalf by Dr. Kuhlmau
and his sympathizers.
The resolutions were read by Dr. Wood
ward, the secretary. Dr. Kuhlman then
arose and made a- formal motion that they
be laid over till the next meeting and
published, and a copy sent to each mem
ber.
The motion was defeated, and then Dr.
"rank Donaldson moved for their adop
ion, being seconded by Dr. John Mont
;omery.
On vote the motion was defeated. Dr.
F. W. Cheney then moved that they be
tabled and the motion prevailed. Their
text was as follows:
To the officers and members of the San Fran
cisco County Med'cal Society :
Whereas, Certain incorporated bodies and
certain so-called charitable and benevolent
societies have within this City and County, in
Dursuance of certain clauses inserted in their
laws, entered into contracts with certain medi
cal men, members of this society, where
by medical and surgical services are rendered
to the members in said bodies, regardless of
the charges specified in the fee bill adopted
by this society ; and
Whereas, The State Medical Society and
several county medical societies throughout
this Stale have adorned resolutions condemn
ing said medical contract systems; tneretore
be it hereby
Resolved, That it is the sense of this society
that said medical contract systems are perni
cious, for the following reasons :
Firstâ They operate to isolate and remove
from general medical competition about 75
per cent of the sick in this City aud County.
Secondâ They Oi ertue to concentrate In the
hands of about one-tenth of the members of
the medical profession fully 75 per cent of the
sick in this City and County.
Thirdâ They operate to enable unscrupulous,
undignified and unqualified medical men to
exist as such, contrary to the laws of the sur
vival of the fittest and ths best interests of
humanity.
Fourthâ They operate to pauperize the scru
pulous, diguified and qual tied members of
our honorable proiession, whose appreciation
of the calling is uch as noi to allow th m to
stoop to such nefarious practices.
Fifthâ They operate as pauperizing agents
upon the masses by lulling them in:o years of
false security, during which they neglect to
provide by proper economic meihods for the
legitimate expenses of competent medical
services and honest medicines during serious
illnesi requiring skill not possessed by the
average contract doctor.
Sixthâ They operate to cause substitution of
drugs and other dishonest prescription prac
tices on the part of physicians ana pharma
cists, as neither can do justice to himself or
the sick under contracts that limit the price
of prehcriptions to from 15 to 25 cents each.
Seventhâ They operate to prevent scientific
medical investigation, as no scientific physi
cian can afford to give the time necessary for
a proper Investigation of a case while he is
limited by contract to a lew cents per visit.
Eighthâ They operate to deprive the sick of
proper and timely medical consultation, oft
times disastrous to the life of the patient and
for the following reasons: (a) The contract
makes no provisions tor this most valuable
aid to the attending physician a< d patient;
(b) he patient will not pay a consultation fee
when his contract calls for necessary medical
services and medicines during il.ness, and Tha
society would regard such procedure as an ad
mission of incompetence ; (c), a contract doc
tor would rather allow his patient to die than
to call in a consulting physician at his own ex
pense and run the risk of being exposed as a
contract doctor to the rest oi the fraternity.
Ninthâ They operate to lower the scientific
standard of medical men, as the only qualifi
cations required of contract doctors are poli
tical cunning and unscrupnlousness.
Tenthâ They operate to lower the physical
and moral standard of medical men, as con
tract doctors must quite frequently participate
in nightly orgies with members of the ring
upon whose influence their jobs depend, where
food, drink and language incompatible with
physical and mental healthfulness of brain
workers are freely dispensed.
Eleventhâ They operate to destroy that pe
culiar, inherent, scientific and ethereal har
mony upon the lines of which alone scientific
medical men can act in unison to carry out
the grave objects of their profession, namely,
the prevention, amelioration acd cure of
disc ase.
Twelfthâ They constitute a premeditated,
malicious conspiracy on the part of unworthy,
ambitious and avaricious medicul men against
the best interests of the medical proiession
and humanity in general; therefore, be it
further resolved,
First â That no person shall be eligible to
membership in this association who shall,
after the adoption of these resolutions, enter
into any contractâ written, verbal, expressed
or implied â with any individual, corporation,
society or organization to furnish medical or
surgical services at a rate below the charges
specified in the fee bill adopted by this society.
Second â that any member of this society
who shall, after the adoption of these resolu-
I tions, enter into any contract, written, verbal,
expressed or implied â with any individual,
corporation, society or organization to fur
nish medical or surgical services at a rate
below the charges specified 'in the fee bill
adopted by this society shall be expelled from
membership.
Thirdâ That nothing contained within these
resolutions shall be ao construed as to apply
to any contract (of not more than one year's
duration) entered iuto prior to the adoption
of these resolutions, or to any salaried muni
cipal medical officer, or resident physician,
connected with a hospital not supported by an
assessed membership.
Fourth â That these resolutions shall go Into
effect immediately upon their adoption.
Respectfully submitted this 13th day of Octo
ber, 1896. Charles G. Kuhlman, M.D.
After the defeat of his resolutions Dr.
Kuhlman gave due notice that he would
bring the matter up for consideration
aeain, and seemed nothing daunted by his
failure.
Several standing committees were ap
pointed and officers for the ensuing year
were elected as follows:
Dr. G. F. Carpenter, president; Dr. F.
E. Frisbe, vice-president; Dr. A. P. Wood
ward, recording iecretary; Dr. Frank
Petre, corresponding secretary; Dr. B. C.
Kelly, treasurer.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The miners have the floor.
Golden oratory flows freely.
Everybody talks of golden prospects
now.
Expansion is good as a rule, but let us
hope Grover will not try it on the coming
message.
Prosperity shines all over tbe State and
prostrate industries are picking them
selves up.
St. Louis is just now the proudest city in
the Union. She is exulting in her first
horse sbow.
There is a chance for the Dingley bill to
go through this winter. Tbe Senate has
seen a new light.
The Bryanite leaders are silent, but the
prophets have resumed business by pre
dictiug what will happen in 1900.
The country voted for prosperity aud is
reaping the reward much sooner than
even the most sanguine expected.
You do not have to go East to find signs
of reviving industry. There are plenty of
them rignt here in San Francisco.
The mining industry is big enough to
have a representative in the Cabinet, and
Congress ought to provide for one.
We have no Half-million Club to lead us
on just now, but all the same we will be
able to claim tbat figure in a few years.
Not all the States voted for McKinley,
but all are sending in reports of expand
ing industries as a result of his election.
If Cleveland does not say something
about the Cuban question in his message
we shall know he is the same old Grover.
It will not be charity but business that
will provide lor the poor this winter, and
â¢*ork and wages will be better than free
soup.
Send California novelties and dainties to
your Eastern friends during the holidays
and help to advertise the products of tbe
State.
From the present outlook for the min
ing industry it would seem the days of
old. the days of gold, are about to return
again.
Business cannot revive too quickly nor
spread itself too fast. Winter is coming
and there are lots of good workingmen out
of employment.
The interests of labor and capital are the
eatne, and tbe men who marcLed'together
and voted together are now reaping the
benefits together.
The Valley road leads the way in com
petition and other roads will follow if the
people are only prompt in snpporting en
terprise and providing rights of way.
The gold-standard free-traders who are
asserting that the victory was not for pro
tection afford another illustration of how
easily some men can fcol themselves.
The proposed ordinances providing for
open food inspection stations will be
generally approved by the people. We all
wish pure food as well as plenty of it.
Chicago has a company that promises
her 90-cent gas, and yet she seems to re
gard the promise itself as the only cheap
gas she wants and won't take stock in it.
There should be a good exhibit of Cali
fornia products at the Guatemalan exposi
tion, for while the trade there may be
very great now it has the potency of vast
expansion.
The proposal of some of the fusion lead
ers to get rid of Altgeid and Tillman may
be taken as a proof they are willing to up^
set the old apple-cart and start out with a
new one next time.
As Salisbury seems disposed to accept
the decision of the United States on the
Venezuelan question we can hardly dis
pute his proposition that the controversy
is virtually settled.
We need not be surprised if we have a
very large immigration of dramatic critics
from Germany this winter. Kaiser Wil
liam has written a play ana threatens to
have it produced throughout the empire.
The world does not seem to have moved
much during our political campaign, and
now that we have time to look it over
again we see tbe old issues, crises and
questions in much tbe same shape they
were three months ago.
New Jersey mosquitoes transported
across the ocean by tbe big steamers are
said to flourishing in London as if they
liked tbe climate, and it is probable Lon
don will soon have so many New York
peculiarities if won't be worth while to
make a voyage to see it.
Everything asserted by the Republican
par y during the campaign has been
iiroven by the result, and even more
quickly than some Republicans expected.
The swift oDening of mills and expansion
of industry has been a wonderful object
iesson to the whole country.
An extra session of Congress seems to
be a necessity, for while the present Sen
ate might consent to a revenue tariff it
will not support a thorough system of
protection such as the people voted for
and the .Republican party is pledged to
snact*
THE MINERS' CONVENTION.
One of the most important conventions
assembled in the State for n Jong time is
that of the gold miners of California, now
being held in Odd Fellows' Hall, and of
whose proceedines a full account is given
in another part of this paper.
This original industry, gold mining,
which was the cause of the settlement of
this State in 1849 by the Americans in
large numbers, has been for a time almost
supplanted by the more extensive indus
tries of fruit-growing, wool-growing and
wheat and cattle raising. It js now, how
ever, experiencing a rebirth, and within a
very short time promises to ba more profit
able and to yield much larger quantities
of the precious metal than ever before.
In the pioneer days and up to the
time of the comparative decadence of
the mining industry all the work
done was on the surface ana in the
beds of streams with sluiceboxes, rock
ers and pans in the primitive fashion.
In fact considerable mining is yet being
done in tbat way on the old grounds by
the poorer class of workers, who are satis
lied with earnings of a dollar or two a day,
coupled with independence and hope.
Next came the era of hydraulic mining,
which was being prosecuted on a large
scale, when it was practically stopped
owing to the opposition of farmers along
the banks of the streams into which the
gravel and earth were Hashed. Quartz
mining received some attention a little
more than a decade ago and has increased
with rapid strides, with the prospect that
within the next year or two there will be
large accessions of American and foreign
capital to work the quartz mines.
The mission of the Miners' Association
is to settle the differences between the
hydraulic miner and the farmer, to put
an end to the vexatious and expensive
litigation by which the validity of min
eral land titles is determined and to in
stitute several reforms for the welfare of
the industry.
The association is to be congratulated
on the success of its efforts in harmonizing
the divergent interests of the farmer and
the hydraulic miner, which the reports
read yesterday seem to indicate is in a
fair way of being accomplished. One ele
ment in its favor is the fact tbat the
miners have always been law-abiding,
patient and foroearine under the most ir
ritating conditions.
The temper of the present convention is
in line with this sentiment. Indeed, if
one were to judge of the convention by
the high standing and integrity of its
membership the sentiment could hardly
be otherwise. Some of the foremost men
in the State are among its delegates, giv
ing the benefit of tneir counsel auJ experi
ence to the younger workers in the com
mon cause.
men who delve into the earth with
pick and shovel have learned the value of
union. They have the best wishes of the
whole people of the State in their efforts
toward the advancement of the industry
to whicn they have devoted their livea,
and whose prospects are now brightening

themselves but for all California.
DEMOCRATIC DEMAGOGUES.
When it was reported a few days ago
that the Democratic leaders intended to
rid their party oi the domination of Alt
geld and Tillman but little attention was
paid to it by the people. The report was
legarded as a hope rather than as a fact,
and very few expected that a serious
attempt would be made by any nota
ble class of Democratic statesmen to re
alize it.
It is now announced, however, that Mr.
Altgeid has become alarmed by the threat
and will make an active canvass for the
Democratic nomination for Senator from
Illinois. This activity on the part of Alt
geld implies a fear that the movement to
dislodge him from the supreme councils
of the party will be undertaken in earnest,
and shows that he considers it nece?sar3 T
to guard against it by taking ihe aggres
sive at once.
The course of his reasoning is clear.
The Republican majority in the Illinois
Legislature will be so large that the Dem
ocratic nomination for Senator will hardly
be of sufficient importance to count even
as a complimentary vote; but it will nev
ertheless serve to Bhow to whom the Dem
ocrats of Illinois look for leadership, and
if Altgeid secures the nomination the
attempt to read him out of the party will
be rendered futile and foolish.
The general public has but very little
interest in the family quarrels of a party
so discredited as Democracy is to-day, but
it can hardly refrain from taking sides
with the conservative leaders of the party
against the Altgelds and the Tillmans.
While we have a party government, such
as prevails among us at present, there
must of necessity be an opposition as well
as an administration party, and It is a
matter of National concern that the oppo
sition should be led as wisely and patriot
ically as the successful party. An opposi
tion headed by Altgeid and Tillman would
be almost as subversive of the general
good as an administration under their
control, for it would mean ceaseless agita
tions and endless appeals to prejudice and
passion.
It is startling to reflect that such men
could in this country have attained to so
much power as to even succeed in nomin
ating a candidate for the Presidency who
stood within a measurable distance of suc
cess. The election of McKinley affords
the Democratic party an opportune mo
ment for getting rid of the men who have
disgraced it and demoralized it. If any
considerable number of Democratic lead
ers resolve to overthrow Altgeid and Till
man, they will have the sympathies of the
people. Even those men who are most
opposed to Democracy will be glad to see
it restored to its former honorable posi
tion. No great party in this country
should be controlled by agitators, and
Democracy must get rid of Altgeid and
Tillman, or else the country will get rid of
Democracy.
SALISBURY'S SPEECH.
The address of Lord Salisbury at the
Lord Mayor's banquet in London was
chiefly notable for the references made to
the settlement of the Venezuelan contro
versy, the possible interference of the
powers for the protection of Armenia, and
the position of the British Government
with reference to Egypt.
On the first subject, Lord Salisbury's
statement will be satisfactory to the
American people. He declares: "Our
difficulty for months has been to define
settled districts, and the solution Has, I
think, come from the Government of the
United States that we should treat our
colonial empire as we treat individuals;
that the same lapse of time which protects
the latter in civic life from having their
title questioned should similarly protect
an English colony."
While the Governments of the United
States and of England have not yet
reached an agreement as to whether the
English colonies in Venezuela have any
right tnere, against the claims of the
Venezuelan", it seems clear from the
statement of Lord Salisbury that the
principle upon, which the question is to be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1896.
decided has been virtually determined,
and, this being so, he was perhaps justi
fied in saying tbat the Venezuelan ques
tion is settled.
Tbe explanation why England does not
interfere alone for the protection of Ar
menia is so lucid that it would seem there
can iiardly be any further dispute on tbat
subject. The only way to protect Armenia
would be to send there a force sufficient to
make an armed occupation of the country,
and this England is not able to do. Until
a concert of action among thÂ« great na
tions of Europe is arranged it would be as
foolish for the British to attempt to solve
the Turkish question as it would be for
this country to have attempted to settle
the money question by engaging in the
free coinage of silver without the aid or
co-operation ot Europe.
The statements of the British Premier
in regard to Egypt will not be so well re
ceived as were his remarks concerning
Venezuela and Armenia. It is not un
likely that his declaration on this question
may give rise to another European crisis,
for while he did not say so in direct terms
he nevertheless implied that the British
Government has no intention whatever to
evacuate Egypt.
This is the rirst time that a British Min
ister has ever officially made use of such
plain language in regard to the English
occupation of the Nile country, and will
be taken as evidence tbat England has
ceased to fear any coalition against her in
Northern Africa and is now well nigh
prepared to formally annex Egypt to the
empire.
The speech of the Prime Minister of
England at the Lord Mayor's banquet has
tbe form of a mere after-dinner talk, but
nevertheless for a long-time past it has
been regarded as one of the most respon
sible utterances of the Government. Not
even tbe Queen's speech at the opening of
Parliament carries more weight with
diplomacy than does the address at the
Mayor's banquet. It is certain, therefore,
tbat what Lord Salisbury has said may be
taken as the expression of the resolution
of the British Government on the three
great points to which we have referred.
Great Britain will submit to American
arbitration iv Venezuela, she will not give
aid to Armenia without the assistance of
other nations, and sne bas no intention to
evacuate Egypt. It is on this basis that
the nations of the earth must deal with
her so long as Lord Salisbury retains
power.
THE GUATEMALAN EXHIBIT.
It is pleasing to learn that the merchants
and manufacturers of California are tak
ing a keen interest in the Guatemalan ex
position aad intend to make fairly good
exhibits of California products. The issue
is one of considerable importance to the
State. In the nature of things our trada
in manufactured goods must be largely
with Central and South America and with
the islands of the Pacific. Everything
therefore which tends to build up that
trade carries with it a promise not only of
immediate good but of better things to
come.
It will be difficult for California to com
pete with the East except in the produc
tion of certain classed of fruit and some
quality of manufactures of woods peculiar
to the coast. The great mass of our man
ufacturing must seek an outlet by the
Pacific and a market in those lands which
border on tbat great ocean. Trade with
Guatemala may bo slight now, but it has
within it possibilities of growth. More
over what begins in that small country
may expand throughout all of Central
America and extend to the larger and
richer countries of the southern conti
nent.
It would be well for oar people to send
to the exposition not only exhibits of our
manufactures but delegations of the rep
resentatives of our merchants. The ex
hibit of manufactured goods would sbow
the Guatemalans what we have to sell,
while the representatives of our merchants
could study and learn what the Guate
malans wish to buy. It is within the lim
its of possibility that there are many
thing 3 now demanded in Central America
which we do not produce, but can produce
profitably as soon aa we know where to
find a market for them. " #
The pledge In the Republican National
platform to promote the upbuilding of the
American merchant marine gives pronii?e
of increased facilities for trade with
Pacific Ocean ports. If our merchants
find a market to the south or in the
Orient, we can rely upon it that there will
be favorable legislation to assist us in pro
viding the ships necessary to transport our
goods.
The first task is of course to find a
market. The Guatemalan exposition of
fers a good opportunity to achieve that
purpose, and by taking full advantage of
it we may in this dawn of the new era of
prosperity make the beginning of a trade
which will eventually secure to our mer
chants ana our manufacturers an oppor
tunity for an almost indefinite expansion
of the industry and the commerce of this
State.
PURE FOOD.
Two ordinances, intended to enforce
the regulations provided by the Board of
Health for food inspection have been
submitted to the Board of Supervisors
and referred to the Health and Polics and
Judiciary committees jointly. These ordi
nances affect the general welfare in im
portant respects and deserve attentive
consideration from ail who take an inter
est in auch matters.
One of the proposed ordinances aims to
prevent the furnishing of impure or adul
terated supplies to public institutions, and
the second is intended to prevent the sale
in the City of imp uremilk and meat.
The plan for carrying out the intention
is the same in each ordinance. It pro
vides for the examination and inspection
at open public stations of ail supplies for
municipal institutions, and of all milk or
meat intended for use as food in the City.
On the face of this plan there is nothing
objectionable. It would seem that inspec
tion at open public stations would be fair
both to the public and to those whose
commodities were to be investigated, and
that no harm could possibly come to deal
ers from such a procedure.
It has been clear for a long time that
communities will have to guard against
impure food. The American people, by
reason of the abundant supply of good ar
ticles of food of all classes, have been in
different to this subject long after Euro
pean nations have made important steps
in tbe direction of governmental super
vision. We are, however, rapidly ap
proaching European conditions. The de
mand for cheap food in this country has
led to the adulteration of various articles
intended for human consumption, and,
moreover, to the sale of diseased or tainted
meat. Diseases resulting from the use of
such food are dangerous to the entire
community, and it is not only the right
but the duty of those in authority to guard
against them.
Whetner the proposed ordinances are
the best that could be devised mast be left
for experts to decide. It is sufficient to
say the Board of Health should be clothed
with sufficient powers to protect the in
mates of public institutions and the people
generally against impure food.
The present board has done its work
well. The vigilance of the milk inspector
in particular has been noteworthy and
commendable. The people are on the side
of pure food. Popular sentiment sus
tains the Board of Health, and if further
legislation is needsd aa the proposed
ordinances suggest the Supervisors will
have the general support of the people in
enacting it.

Tbe snowy blossoms back to me
And all tue buds that used to be!
Blow back again the grassy ways,
Oh truant feet, and lift the baze
Of happy summer from the trees
That trail their tresses in the aeas
Of grain that float and overflow
The orchard lands of long ago 1
Blow back the melody that slip*
In lazy laughter irom the lips
'1 hat marvel much that any kiss
Is sweeter than the apple is.
Blow buck tue twitter of the birds;
The lisp, the thrills and the words
Of merriment that found the shin*
Of summer-time a glorious wine
That drenched the leaves that loved It so
In orchard lands of long ago.
Oh, memoir, alight and sine
Where round the rosy pippin cling
And golden russets glint an 1 gleam
As In the old Arabian dreamâ
The fruits of that enchanted tree
The glad Alad<lin robbed for me!
And urowsy winds, awake and tan

A heart ripe aj the apples grow
In orchard lands of long ago.

MR HANNA
New- York Sun.
To the unequaled organizer, amttzing politi
cal and supereminent non-partisan, Mark
Hanna of Cleveland, Ohio, this Nation owes
this morning the profoundest irratitude.
Not because he had the wit to pick out a
winner in the Republican ranks and the loy
alty and energy to put his candidate through.
Not because he organized for victory with a
scientific precision which has no parallel in
the history of Presidential campaigns. Not
because he conducted tne business in hand
with a smoothness like to that of the oil of
Lucca, a vigilance that neglected no cor
ner or by-place in the vast territory over which
his eyes swept like searchlights, and a magna
nimity which kept his soul urruffled and his
brain effective under personal abuse the
most vicious and brutal, perhaps, which any
man holding his post has ever had to en
counter.
These are matters of decree, and in these
matters Mr. Hanna differs in degree only from
other able and successful campaign managers
wno have preceded him.
His title to true greatness and his certificate
of lasting fame in this: Cheerfully and with
out hesitation, in the midsi of a campaign
elaborately planned to follow certain prear
ranged lines of management, he reconniee.l
the commands of au authority higher than
that of Republican partisanship and shaped
His course accordingly.
It takes a great leader to revise his entire
p<an of campaign, to abandon his precon
ceived ideas of policy, to fling away what
seemed to be the mainstay of his own candi
date, and to proceed to victory under the
oannerofanew and unforeseen issue; but
that is what this leader has done.
When Mr. IJanna, the Protectionist and the
mend of William McKinley, gave up his orig
inal plan x>t subordinating the question of hon
est money to t hut of the tarill", and manfully
accepted the dreaded word gold, which others
hud lorcyd Into the St. Louis platform, perhaps
apainst his own desires at the time, lie broad
ened the issue from Republican partisanship
to ISational patriotism. Ue made this victory
possible when he made it possible for patriotic
Democrats to vote with patriotic Republicans;
and he made it possible for patriotic Demo
crats so to vote when he put eside the tariff
schedules and raised the flap.
Having tuken up the flag, Mr. Hanna bore it
on to the glorious result wnich brightens the
skies this morning; and to Mr. Hanna, the
non-partisan, the Sun extends the assurances
of its most distinguished consideration.
NATIONAL INTEGRITY VINDICATED
Philadelphia Times (Dem.).
Never since the re-election of Abraham Lin
coln in 1864, when the country was in the ter
rible throes of fraternal war, was there a con
test for the Presidency that involved an issue
of such vital moment as tbat which was over
whelmiugly decided by the people in the elec
tion of McKinley. It was an issue between
National life and National death; an issue be
tween prosperous industry and impoverished
industry; an issue between enlightened
progress and advancement and tne fatal retro
gression of decay. It was a contest that called
into play the most artful and ingenious power
of the demagogue, to play upon the passions of
the unfortunate and tempt them to the self-
Infliction of even greater sorrows upon them
selves than they are now suffering; but the
American people have proved their integrityâ
and more, they have proved that the life of the
Republic can be safely trusted to its present
sovereign power.
The election of JicKinley to the Presidency
is not a partisan triumph. True, he is h Re
publican; anoarnest, unfalteiiug Republican.
His administration will be distinctively Re
publican; his patronage will be awarded to
his Republican friends; but, above all, he will
stand firm as a rock in the execution ot the
imperious mandate of the Nation to maintain
its integrity, its dignity, its honor and its
matchless advancement. While the triumph
carries with it all that is involved in a Repub
lican victory it is more distinctly a victory or
the patriotic people of all parties of the Na
tion over elements which have impaired our
credit, paralyzed cur industries, brought stag
nation upon our commerce aud trade, made
capitai retire from active enterprise and
sought to sow the dragon's teeth oi sectional
and class hatred among the people, who have
overwhelmingly declared for a common
brotherhood.

That Was Anotheeâ R. P., Oakland, Cal-
This correspondent, who is a close reader of
"Answers to Correspondents," culls attention
to an answer in relation to the ' 'Dapce of
Death," and suggests that there was published
I in San Francisco a book of that name. The
] answer given was in response to the question
I asked, but as the other is interesting it is
\ given. Says our correspondent: "That was
; tne title of a small boob written in tbe early
! seventies by William H. Rulolson, of the old
I firm of photographers, Bradley & Rulofson.
I In this work the author condemned the waltz
; as immoral and leading to ruin. It was very
j plain in its statements and had a large sale."
Baldnessâ A. S., City. Baldness in the hn
man family arises from many causes. There
is accidental baldness, which may involve the
whole scalp or may be only in patches. These
patches may ruu Into each other, and some
consider this condition a sort of ringworm.
Sir Erasmus Wilson says it is caused by an
atrcphy of the hair follicles. Baldness in the
comparatively young and middle-aged may
occur from wearing waterproof caps, which,
preAenting evaporation from the head,
occasions an unhealthy state of the skin.
Senile baldness is not necessarily the con
sequence of old age; it may arise, like the pre
ceding variety, from an atrophy oi those parts
on which the nairs depend for nutrition. It
begins usually on the crown of the head,
where the supply of blood is naturally leRS
abundant. Women have more of soft tissue
under the skin, therefore the vessels are less
likely to be Interfered with; hence they
are not so frequently bald as men. The causes
of baldness &!â¢â¢â¢ the defective supply of nutrition
mentioned, h. i mily tendency, late hours, dissi
pation, but, especially old age. Tue hair falls
off after severe Illness or after other causes of
general debility. The treatment of baldness
consists in attention to cleanliness and In ex
citing tne languid circulation of the scalp to
greater activity by using a hard brush and the
application of stimulants. What the proper
remedy is in a particular case can best be de
termined by one who makes a study of hair
and hair disease.

EDOUARD REMENYI
BOBS UP SERENELY
The Great Violinist Is So
journing in This
City.
He Has Just Completed Writing
a National Hymn for ,
Hungary.
CONTESTING FOE A GREAT PRIZE
He Accepts a Lcca! Composition at a
Part of His Concert Repertoire.
Praises Sauvlet's Talent,
Edonard Kemenyi, the famous Hun
garian violinist, is sojourning in this City
as the guest of G. yon SauvleU The fact
of his presence was not known until yes
terday, when his sprightly figure was
observed on the street, much to the sur
prise of his many friends and admirers.
Despite the tremendous pressure which
has been brought to bear upon him as a
result of the almost uninterrupted seriea
of concert tours on this continent for the
past three years, he still retains his old
time ardor, and the complaisant smile
which has always beeu characteristic of
this gf-nius is as winning as ever.
Mr. Kemenyi was seen last evening at
tbe Sauviet residence, on Fulton street,
where a few select musicians had gathered
to honor the event of the great maestro's
visit here.
Mr. Kemenyi would consent to perform
but one selection, and this was a simple
little ''Christmas Berceuse," written es
pecially for him by his friend Sauviet. Ue
declared that in point cf melody, effect
and general construction this work is in
deed of exceptional merit. After shower
ing endless praise upon the composer he
announced that he would bencelorth in
clude the composition in his concert re*
pertoire.
Mr. Remenyi ha 3 just completed a na
tional hymn, which he intends dedicating
to the King of Hungary. It is of the
impressive school and* calculated to
awaken the patriotic souls of his country
men. Mr. Sauviet performed the com
position on the piano, and forcibly illus
trated the fact that Kemenyi's calculations
are not based upon theory.
The facts which led up to his determina
tion in producing such a composition are
interesting to say the least. "You must
first understand," said he, "that Hungary,
being a dual empire, the Hungarians
recognize their ruler while in tbat coun
try as their King and not the Emperor of
Austria.
"We have three national anthems. The
'Rakoczy,' an instrumental number, and
an invocation and national church hymn.
The latter, by Haydn, is aiso used in Aus
tiia, and in order to nave a distinct Hun
garian anthem the Pariiameut has offered
a prize equal to about $20,000 for a compo
sition answering this purpose.
"The hymn which I have just completed
came to me as an inspiration and I nave
no doubt as regards its acceptance."
Mr. Remenyi has just completed a suc
cessful concert tour throughout the United
States and Canada, embracing a period of
one year and one day. His initial con
cert for the coming season will taÂ£e place
at Chicago on tho 24th inst. He is dated
in San Francisco for next March, and from
here his company leaves for an eighteen
months' tour iv South America.

Departure of the Frawley Company
on the Steamer Australia for
Honolulu.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Umatilla got in from Puget
Sound yesterday with a cargo of wheat.
After discharging she will co to the
Union Iron Works, where she will be
docked for repairs. To look at the vessel
as she steamed up to her dock no one
would ever think that for weeks she had
Jain on tbe beach with the water up to
her main deck.
Over a month ago the Umatilla left here
for Victoria, B. C. On arriving at that
point a pilot took charge for the voyage
around the Sound and ran her on the
rocks near Port Townsend in a dense fog.
A big hole was torn in the vessel's bottom
and she began to fill. Captain Hunter
tnen headed the vessel for the beach and
got her into shallow water before she
went down. Captain Hunter and Chief
Engineer Lacey are both almost worn out
with the work of attending to ihe raising
of the steamer and both are proud of the
fact that sac is once more in San Fran
cisco.
"I cannot say too much for my crew,"
said Captain Hunter. "Every man stuck
to his post, and firemen kept steam up
while working up to their knew in water.
There was no panic among the passen
gers, but none of them would go below
until Chief Steward Curtis got the galley
fire gome at 4 a. m. and made coffee and
toast. When everything was ready the
gonj: was rung, and the boya rounded all
the cabin passengers iuto the dining-room
for a snack. That put heart into all of
thorn, and they became more cheerfnl.
They had hardly finished eating before the
water be^an entering the dining-room,
but the passengers did not know it. N-xt
Mr. Curtis saw that the steerage passen
gers were taken care of, and thea het>r
dered breakfast to be got ready.
"By this time the water was a foot deep
in the galley, bnt the cook and his assist
ants stuck to their work, knowing that
| the vessel could sink very little lower, and
jby7a. M. a fine meal was prepared. Then
the cabin passengers were marshaled into
the steerage and served with as good a
meal as they would have received at sea,
only the surroundings were not as pleas
ant. After tue cabin passengers had fin
ished the tables were cleared and then re
set for the steerage passengers. I tell you
a good meal puts heart into a man or a
woman, and to hear those passengers
laughing and joking after the tables wera
cleared you would never think we had all
had a narrow escape from going down in
deep water. Ali> well that ends well,
however, and Curtis deserves all the
credit for the inspiration that made him
get that coffee and toast ready at 4 o'clock
in the morning."
After the water had been pumped out
of the Umatilla the tugs Magic, Tyee and
Tacoma took hold of the big steamer and
towed her to Port Townsend. The ac
companying sketch is taken from a snap
shot made by an amateur photographer
while the tuus and their tow were making
for the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
landing at Port Townsend. After some
temporary repairs the vessel was put on
the drydock and big timbers weie placed
over the hole and bolted to the hull.
Everything was made perfectly water
tieht, and then the Umatilla went to Ta
coma to load wheat. It will be several
months before she will again be ready for
service.
The British ship Lancing stuck in the
mud off the gas works early yesterday.
She was being moved from Union street
to the gay works to discharge her coal
cargo, but as she is unusually long and
has a big draft she could not get alongside.
She was afterward pulled off and anchored
in the stream. A berth along the front
will be secured for her and the coal will
be lightered to the gas works.
The members of the Hawaiian National
band again attended the sailing of the
steamer Australia yesterday. There were
over 500 people on the wharf, and they one
and all 'thoroughly enjoyed the playing
and singing of the band.
The Frawley Company went down on
the steamer. They will open the Royal
Hawaiian Opera-house, and in three weeks
will present twelve plays. Jacob Gottlob
went with the company as manager. The

Tho whaling bark California docked at
Howard No. 3, and will be discharged and
iitted out again. Wallace James, the sec
ond mate, was not at his post, however,
and the men say he left the vessel on the
Siberian coast. He and Captain Fisher
and Chief Officer Pease could not get along
together, and all because, the men Bay,
.lames was the best whaler on the ship.
Fisher and Pease are brothers-in-law, and
as James was not liked by them his life
was not a pleasant one. He left the
wiialer on the first opportunity, and took
passage on the schooner Borealis for Vic
toria, B. C He is there now and will sail
next season on a sealiue cruise.
A big tleet of ships arrivad off the heads
yesteiday afternoon, but the fcg settled
down alter three of them had been made
out. The first to get in was the German
i ship BrittnniA, in ballast from Caleta
â¢ Buena. Captain Haesloop reported that
on the Bth inst., wiien 200 miles off San
Francisco, he saw four three-masted and
one four-masted ship and one bark, all
bound for *Â»his port. The Edinburghshire,
69 days from Newcastle, N. 8. W., with
1934 tons of coal, and the British sbip'Dra
maiis, 54 days from Sydney, N. S. \Y.. xÂ»t
in later on. Tne bark Mohican from Hon
olulu was seven miles out when last heard
from. She has come up in the remarkably
faÂ«t time of eleven days, but unless a tug
picks her up she will not get in before this
morning. Four other ships are outside, but
could not be made out from the Point
Lobos station.
The whaling steamer Thrasher got in
last night with 2100 pounds of bone, 200
barrels ol oil, 390 pounds of ivory and fltty
foxskina. Captain Coean reports that on
October 31, in latitude 47 north, longi
tude 180 west, he ran into a heavy south
west gale. The steamer was swept from
stem to stern and two of the whaleboats
and their davits were swep: away.
Gustave Kretzschmar went into the

captured the thief near Howard street and
took him back to the Harbor Police
station, where he was charged witn petty
larceny.
There was a small fire on the Vallejo
steamer Sunol yesterday. A bundle of
oily rags fell on the stove, and in a few
moments there was a blrize. The coot was
away at the time, and belore he got back
the woodwork was in a blaze. An alarm
of lire was raised and the fire hose was
got out. Before it was put In operation,
however, the blaze had been extinguished
by throwing buckets of water on the flames.
The damage was flight, aud there was no
excitement among the passengers.
ANOTHER GREAT DRY-GOODS
STORY.
Livingston Broi. Will Open on Post
Street March 1.
D. and S. Livingston, of the firm of
Livingston Bros., have leaÂ«ed a large store
on Post street, In the Crocker building,
where they -will open up with a large stock
of dry goods March 1. They leave to
night with four department buyers for
New York and Europe, and will return to
San Francisco about January 1. This en
terprise has been long under considera
tion by them, but would not have been
entered into except for the success of the
sound-money ticket in the late election.
It is only one more of the many new en
terprises which will he started up in San
Francisco to give employment to hun
dreds of men and furnish the most com
plete refutation of the claims of the
Bryanites.
A Forgetful "Native Son."
.Tue Hoy, a Chinese, who claims to be a
native son of California, was before United
States Circuit Court Commissioner Ileacock
yesteraay on a writ of habeas corpus. He wai
refused a lauding by Collector Wlee, but bo
fore the Commissioner he made out a (rood
case until one of tbe Collector's lnnpecion
threw * wot blanket on the fellow's testimony.
Moy Mid that he had worked three years at
QuongOn'i store at 1007 Dupont street. The
inspector testified that when ha took Quong
within half a block of On's store the native
son could not tell which way to go to roach
the place. Now the Chinaman claims that lie
did not understand the interpreter's question
when asked the direction to the store. The
case was continued.

SPECIAL ELECTION
NOT PROBABLE
Non - Partisan Committee
Did Not Receive En
couragement.
Election Commissioners Were
Not in Favor of Making
Haste.
CONFERENCE LAST EVENING.
Report of the Proceedings of the Day
Was Discussed, but No Action
Was Taken-
Joseph Britton dropped into the Mer
chants' Association yesterday and not
finding J. Richard Freud at home, left the
following note:
"The Election Commissioners have re
fused to call an election for freeholders."
This is the outcome of a visit paid to
the Commissioners by a committee of
Non-Partisans consisting of Joseph Le
Breton, Frank J. Sullivan, George K.
Fitch, A. S. Hallidie and Joseph Britton.
Mayor Sutro was not present, but J. M.
Block and H. T. Creswell represented the
board. Both said they were in favor of
the charter, but they could not see their
way clear to the calling of an election of
freeholders. They believed it was not ad
visable to rush through a special election
in time for ratification at the next session
of the Legislature.
Mayor Sutro is strong in his opinion
that there should not be haste in prepar
ing a cnarter and that competent lawyers
should be employed to guide the free
holders and prevent tfie introduction of
unconstitutional provisions, such as were
found in the recently defeated charier.
Such being the case, tbe absence of the
Mayor did not cut much figure in the de
cision given by Creswell and Block.
"Tne refusal of the Election Commis
sioners to call a special election for free
holders settles the whole matter," said J.
Richard Freud. "My idea was, however,
that the refusal was based principally on
the lack of funds. It would cost $50,000
to hold two special elections and tne tax
levy, which does not provide for that ex
penditure, has. already been made up to
tbe end oi June, 1897.
"It is a very hard proposition to collect
subscriptions at large from merchants and
others interested in the framing and
adopting of a new charter. The thing is
that you can not guarantee them that the
charter will be accepted by the people.
Hence, it is almost useless to canvass for
funds from door to door.
"Our experience has been in this last
election tbat about 33,000 citizens failed to
vote for or againat tbe charter. It is that j
they were uneducated up to its provisions.
Therefore a campaign of education would
have to be inaugurated.
"Just think of it, an organic law of this
City being untouched by the voters wno
were so minute in their choice as to place
their cross next tA the names of candi
dates running even for the unexpired
terms in minor offices.
"The charter educational feature should
be kept up until the Legislature meets in
January, 1899, owing to the decision of the
Election Commissioners.
"In November, 1898, there will be an
election for Governor, and in the begin
ning of that year the fifteen freeholders
could frame a charter and submit it to the
people either at anotner special election
in 1898 or at the general Gubernatorial
election. If it is ratified by the reople at
that election it could be submitted at the
Legislature which meets in January, 1899.
j That would be the regular way "a new
charter could be put through.
''Thife process is in accordance vittx sec
tion Bof article XI of the constitution of
California and is the regular method of
acquiring a charter by cities of more than
3500 inhabitants.
"There is a method of getting a new
government for the City of Man Francisco
in accordance with section 6, article XI,
of the constitution of this State, substan
tially as follows:
"Cities may be organized under general
laws whenever a majority of the electors
voting at a general election shall so deter
mine. And all charters'shall be subject
to general laws. Under that section (6) a
general law may be passed by the Legis
lature tbat will meet in January prond
ing for the government of San Francisco.
And it will have to be adopted at a gen
eral election. The next one will only take
place Id November, 1898. 8o that will be
tne first opportunity for the electors to
vote on that charter handed down by tbe
Legislature.
'â¢T c serious objection to acquiring a
new government f r the City as per this
last metbodj is that this charter will be
subject to general laws, except as to mu
nicipal affairs, and there ia do certainty
from the decisions of the Supreme Court |
as to what are exactly municipal affair?." I
A largely attended meeting of the ex
ecutive committee of the Non-Part : sans
was held last evening. George K. Fitch I
presided. Nearly all the members of the
committee were present. The doors were ;
closed at the beginning of the proceed- |
ings and were kept closed until the end,
which was at a late hour. About as tbe
committee were closing their discussion
Mayor-elect Phelan came in and some of
the points that had already been con
sidered were gone over once more.
The entire evening was consumed in
talking over the charter. The Non-Par
tisans are a^ eager as ever they were before
the general election to have some instru
ment adopted for the government of the
City wbicji shall be more in accordance
with their views than the much amended
and often construed consolidation act.
The real business of the evening was to
hear the report of the committee consist
ing of Frank J. Sullivan, Joseph Le Bre
ton, George K. Fitch and A. 8. Hallidie,
who yesterday confeired with the Board
of Election Commissioners with the pur
pose of urging that a special election for
freeholders should be called at once. The
committee conferred with City Attorney
Cresweil and Tax Collector Block, and
also with Garret McEnerney. Nooneex
cepting the committee was adm itted while
this report was made and during the sub- :
sequent discussion. No definite con
clusion was reached. This was given out
upon authority at the hour of adjourn
ment.
From another source it was learned last
evening that City and County Attorney
Creswell conveyed the idea to the com
mittee who called upon him yesterday
tbat he considered the inakmp of a char
ter a matter of considerable difficulty, and
he believed that the proper way to go at
it, if it shonid prove to be advisable at this
time, would be to employ able counsel.
He made no secret of his opinion that
three lawyers of skill at least could be
satisfactorily employed to weigh, word by
word, and to consider the legal bearing of
every proposed provision. Such skill
would guard against errors into which
laymen might possibly fall. He opposed
baste in the adoption of a cbarter.
CLOSED A SALOON.
John A gar of Oakland TVim * Big
Damage Stiit.
Judge Sewall of the Superior Court yes
terday handed down a decision in the case
of Anton Clecak against John &. Agar,
executor of the estate of Joseph Macdon
ough, deceased. The complaint alleges
that Clecak and Peter Miocivich rented
the basement of the Macdonough block,
corner of Fourteenth street and Broad
way, Oakland, for ten years at $200 a
month; that after Macdonongh's death
Agar endeavored to regain possession of
the premises, and in this effort had the
plaintiff arrested for illegally selling liquor
after midnight; that be employed two
witnesses at $50 each to prove this charge,
employed an attorney, and secured the
revocation of plaintiff's license, causing
rum to abandon the business, wherefore
be asked for $24,000 damages.
The attorney tor the defense interposed
a demurrer and on this the case was de
cided.
Judge Sewall mid that the actions of
Agar, even if admitted to be true, were
performed in his individual capacity, and
not as executor of the estate. He added:
It wo'Ud be unreasonable and oppressive to
subject the heirs and devisees of an estate to
liability and loss for the personal torts of an
executor, as to which he is not required to
give any security and for thÂ« commission of
which his office of executor gavo him no spe
cial opportunities.
Assuming, then, which I very much doubt,
that the acts complained of would have been a
breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment, of
the premises If performed by Macdonough, I
do not think that the defendant is liable in his
capacity as executor lor the damages occa
sioned to plaiutiff thereby. â¢
Judge Sewall therefore sustained the de
murrer and gave judgment for tne defend
ant.

AMONG THE LABOR UNIONS
There Is a Very Great Local
Demand for Good Sh:e
makers.
Cigar-Makers to Pass Upoa Union
Constitutional Amendments â Coast
Seamen's Wag s.
At the next meeting of the Cigar-mak
era' Union action will bÂ» taken upon the
amendments to the constitution of the In
ternational Union. These changes were
recommended by the Cigar-makers' Con
vention which met in Detroit on Septem
ber 28. They all relate to the benefit
fund. At present $5 per week is paid in
sick benefits for thirteen weeks. The
amendment increases the time. The death
benefit for one year is $50; for five years
|100; for fifteen years $550, and so on. The
proposed change is to two years instead of
one, six years instead oi five, etc. The de
sire is to raise the out-of-work benefit from
$5 a week to $6 a week for six weeks. An
other channe is to provide that all mem
bers over 50 years of ape and who are out
of work shall ba paid $3 per week indefi
nitely. All the local cigar-makers' unions
in the United States and Canada will pass
upon the same propositions.
Ac the meeting of the Pacific Coast
Shoemakers' Union last evening the re
ports showed that the demand /or shoe
makera in this City is larger than ever.
All of the factories are running full forces.
Many styles of shoes, principally special
patterns that were not maae last year, are
being manufactured in large quantities
this year. There is so much of a demand
for good shoen\akers that a raise in wages
is expected. The raise will not caus* any
I immigration from the East, as workmen
! there will not come so far West on specu
lation. The raiÂ«e in wages will come
from the effonsof the manufacturers lo
secure the good men in other local fac
tories.
The Shinglers' Union is preparing for a
fine entertainment and ball, that will take
place in Academy Hall, on Mission street,
on the evening of Saturday, November 28.
Professional talent Irom the theaters will

Official Words of Praise

Pertinent Comment Made by
Railroad Commissioner
La Rue.
BOASTS THE ETJNTINGTON LINE
Jurisdiction of Street Railroads Viewed
From the Standpoint of the
Commission.
Another installment of the interesting
report to be submitted by the Railroad
Commission to the Governor was pre
pared yesterday by Chairman La Rue and
<>nlv awaits the approval of the other
members of the commission to be incor
porated into the official document.
In this contribution the claims of the
Southern Pacific Company that the 8 per
cent reduction attempted to be made on
grriin rates by the commission was unjust
and virtually a confiscation of the corpo
ration's property are reviewed in the light
of the heavy reductions brought about on
the Southern Pacific lines by the competi
tion of the Valley road, and some perti
nent and striking comment is evolved.
The question of the juri-diction of the
commission ov?r street railways is also
treated at considerable length and several
newai'd important points are developed.
On the subject of rate reductions the re
port will say :
The contention of the Southern Pacific Com
puny was and has at all times been that a re
duction oi rates of freight, us proposed by the
resolution offered by the chairman of this
board, would be contiscatory of their prop
erty.
Tne commission did not adopt the resolu
tion making a reduction of 15 per cent and 20
per cent as proposed, but did, afu-r a long and
careful examination and consideration ot the
question, make an avenge reduction of 8 per
cent upon all grain rates as then in force from
the interior to tidewater over the roads of the
Southern Pacific Company.
The company claimed that this small reduc
tion wouid be confiacatory of their property,
that it was unreasonable ana unjust, and com
menced an action restraining this board from
enforcing compliance with said order reduc
ing rates.
Since the commencement of said action
above referred to the San Francisco and San
Jonquin Valley Railway Company hats been
constructed, and Is now in successful oper
ation between Stockton and Fresno, a distance
of 125 miles, carrying both freight and passen
gers and affordiug adiitional transportation
facilities to the farmers ard business com
muniiy generally of that rich and fertile
ci.untry through which the road is located.
It is paralleled on each side the whole dis
tance Itom Stockton to Fresno by railroads
owned and operated by the Southern Pacific
Company. As soon as the Valley road was so
far completed as to enable it to transport to
market the grain crop of the section oi coun
try through which it passed a schedule of
grain rates was prepared by said company and
submitted to this commission for its approval,
which was upon campu.ri.-on with the schedue
of grain rates adapted and published by this
commission found to Correspond with said re
duced rates, being a reduction of about 8 ver
cent from the rates charged by the Southern
Pacific Company between Stockton, Fresno
and intermediate points prior to the comple
tion of the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway. la addition to the above
noted reduction the San Francisco and San
Joequin Valley Railway abo.ished the switch
ing charge ot 10 cents per ton at Stockton,
which prior to the operation of the Valley
road was charged by the Southern Pacific
Company.
The Valley road, also in connection with
their railroad, made a rate from Stockton to
Port Costa and San Francisco by water of 50
cents per ton, being a reduction of 50 cents
per ton from Stockton to San Francisco upon
the rate charged by the Southern Pacific Com
pany between said points.
Believing the schedule of rates submitted by
the Valley road to be reasonable and just they
werÂ»Â» approved and adopted by this board.
Notwithstanding the contention made by
the Southern Pacific Company in the case now
pending before the United States Circuit
Court, and at all times to this board, that the
rates then established and charged were as
low as they could be made and pay a reason
able profit, and that the reduction as pro
posed, if adopted, would entaii upon the com
pany losses so great that the company would
be thrown Into insolvency and their railroad
and other property into the hands of a re
ceiver, immediately upon the opening of the
Valley road the Southern PÂ«ciflc Company re
duced the rates between Port Costa and Stock
ton and all stations on their respective roads
that are in competition with the San Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley Road. Said rates so
made by the Southern Pacific Company were
In many instances lower than the rates estab
lished by this board, and that were by them
declared and charged to be unjust, unreason
able and confiscatory.
The reduciions above referred to, as made
by the Southern Pacific Company, will aver
age more than 15 p<-r cent lower than the
rates of January 1, 1895, and are a greater re
duction than provided by the original resolu
tion asking for an average reduction of 15 per
cent on thi grain rates of 1895. With a com
peting road running between Stoctton and
Fresno, with water connections to Port Costa
and San Francisco, the business Is divided
then there is a short crop and less than the
usual tonnage to move. Yet with this mate
rial reduction in rates, averaging (including
the abolition of switching charges at Stock
ton) more than 15 per cent from former rates
the Southern Pacific Company is still being
operated, presumably at a profit.
We have not yet heard that it is unable to
pay its current expenses, fixed charges, etc ;
or that from this slight reduction anu compel
titlon it is likely to become insolvent and to
pass into the hands of a receiver.
We believe the rates as now charged from
these competitive points are reasonable just
and ample, and aa much as the traffic can
afford to pay.
After quoting- the section of the consti
tution giving the Railroad Commission
power "to establish rates of charges for
the transportation of passengers and
freights by railroads or other transporta
tion companies," the report will refer to
the act of the Legislature defining the
powers of the commission. In this the
term "transportation companies" is de
clared "to mean and include all com
panies owning and operating railroads
(other than street railroads) within tne
State."
Commenting on this the report will say:
By this act it would appear that it was the
intention of the Legislature to remove from
trie commission, so far as they had power all
control of street railroads.
While the Legislature may grant the com
mission additional power to aid it in the dis
charge of its duties and to carry out the inten
tion of the constitution, can it curtail or re
htrict its powers and jurisdiction and take
from it that control which the constitution
evidently Intended it should have?
The important question arises What are
street raiiroads? Are they confined to the
corporate limits of a city or town to carry pas
sengers from one point of the city or town to
another and confined to the public streets
thereof ? Or do they Include all railroads
operated upon the streets of a city or town and
upon the public highways through the coun
try from one city or town to another and
which carry mail, express matter, passengers
and possibly freight ?
Are not all these transportation companion,
and should they not be unaer the control of
the commission? Or should they be subject
to the control of the city and county authori
ties in whose territory they are located?
These ure questions of much importance
which ought to be judicially determined at
an early day.
Hince the introduction of electricity as a
motor power railroads operated by electricity
huvcj multiplied very rapidly, not only in the
cltleii, but throughout the whoie country.
They have already done away with mosti.f

Should they be considered transportation
companies and subjected to the control of the
Railroad Commission?
Reference is made to the unsuccessful
attempt of the commission to make an
examination of the books of the Market
street Railway Company for the purpose
of determining whether or not a reduction
of fares on the line of the company could
be made without depriving the company
of legitimate profit. In this matter the
jurisdiction of the commission over street
railroads was denied.
Commissioner La Rue's comment on
this p.iuse of the situation is as follows:
The Legislature, in the passage of the act
hereinbefore referred to, in defining the term
"transportation companies" obviously in
tended to remove from the control of the
commission the right to regulate fares upon
street railroads, seemingly in conflict with the
true intent of the cons tltution.
It is then recited that the matter has
been referred to the Attorney-General for
bis consideration and counsel.

near Howard, where a number of parish
ioners met yesterday with Rev. John
Emery and others to dedicate the north
rooms of the basement to the purposes
embraced in the church plan of charity to
the afflicted and hflpless.
"I got the idea while studying the work
of our church in New i'ork on the East
Side," said Rev. Mr. Emery yesterday,
"and 1 concluded that we could" do some
thing of that kind out here. We have
had a successful clothing bureau for along
time, where we dispense clothing to men,
women*nd children; but medcalaidis
often more necessary than clothing.
"Our parish is very large, ext nding
from Fourth street to Eleventh and from
Market to the county line. JThen we have
a triangular territory north of Market
.street from JVlk to O'FarreJl, and there
are many deserving poor in our territory."
Drs. M. H. Atkins and M. D. Harvey
are the regulars of the staff of physicians
and Dr. Guy E. Manninp represents the
homeopathic side of the staff. There will
soon be a specialist for diseases of the

10 to 11 a. m. daily, except on Wednesdays
and Saturdays, when patients will be
treated from 11 to 12.
The plan of giving aid will be to charge
patients 25 cents for medicines and noth

Weather-Chief Morton Says That High

The board of trustees of the Cnamber of
Commerce met at 2 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon and considered several important
matters, among which W33 the establish
ment of a class in navigation at the Lick
Sciiool of Mechanical Arts.
Professor George A. Merrill, the princi
pal of that institution, was before the
board and save valuable information re
garding the practical benefits of such an
action as contemplated. After a consulta
tion the chamber decided to appropriate
sufficient money to furnish the necessary
fittings and instruments for the new
?chool. Professor Merrill stated that he
would lay the matter before the Lick
School board of truatees at their next ses
sion.
Communications were received from the
Chamber of Commerce of Hongkong in I
relation to the trans-Pacific cable and
irom the Sydney Chamber of Commerce
relating to the lumber trade of the Pacific
Coast. This letter from the secretary of
the New South Wales chamber speaks of
certain complaints coming from con
signees of that place regarding the quality
of lumber cargoes shipped from this coast.
The writer refers to that of the Rolz.
which vessel arrived at Sydney from Ta
coma August 20.
The communication was ordered to be
sent to the Pacific Lumber CoÂ»pany for
consideration.
The lollowing letter was also received
from the Vallejo Chamber of Commerce:
The disbursements of public moneys at the
navy-yard for labor is about $1,200*000 per
annum, 75 per cent of which is spent in Val
lejo at the various stores lor supplies and '2s
per cent goes to Oakland and San Francisco.
The navy pay office at San Francisco dis
burses for "open purchases," etc., about $2 -
500,000 per annum. Had the Oregon fitted
out at Mare Islai-d her disbursements would
have been about 9*30,000 per month.
The four Senators and Congressmen at Wash
ington and Oregon will endeavor to prevent
the necessary appropriations for Mare Island,
and will us- their utmost endeavors to pro
cure the largest appropriations for the navy
vard and drydock at Port Orchard, Puget
Sound.
The removal of Commission Rock in Napa
Creek and the dredging of the channel in San
Pabio Bay, off Pinole Point, for about two
miles will remove all obstructions in the way
of the largest ships going to Mare Island.
The partial closing of the navy-yard at Mare
Island nnd the development of "the plant at
Port Orchard would be an irreparable loss to
California and once started can never be re
covered.
A communication was received from the
chief of the United States Weather Bureau
regarding the request for a station to be
located on the summit of Tamalpais in
which the writer denies the petition.
He states that the experience gained from
placing stations upon Pikes Peak and
other high isolated elevations has taught
the bureau that there is no practical bene
fit to be gained from such stations. They
are an expense and are too far removed
from agricultural centers for use.
The chamber discussed this terse an
swer and came to the conclusion that
Chief Sterling Morton did not quite un
derstand the situation. Tamaipaia, al
though only 2604 feet above the breakers
that fall against its base, is from its loca
tion a most admirable place for a weather
station. It is not only situated on the
western verge of the continent, but it
overlooks San Francisco Bay ana the ad
jacent inland waters and a great plain of
agricultural lands north and south.
The chamber decided to address an
| other communication to the weather office
on the subject explaining the situation
more fully.
The following communication was or
dered sent to President Cleveland relative
to the canal measures now pending in
Congress:
San Francisco. November 10, 1896.
To fits Excellency Grove' Cleveland, President of
the Lmted States of America, Washington, D. Câ
iiR: Ihe Chamber of Commerce oi San Fran
cisco respectfully calls your attention to the
Isational find pressing necessity for the prompt
construction of the Nicantgua canal. Our
| people have reason to complain that this im
i portant non-partisan measure, notwithstand
ing the repeated promises of favorable action
bfboih political .parties, has b'.en neglected,
while measures inuring to the benefit of selfish
interests have had precedence in Congress.
We ask you to aid us in procuring the
early enactment of wise National and pa
triotic legislation which will secure for our
country a waierway between the oceans, for
the enhancement of the prosperity of our
producers, manufacturers and merchants all
over the country, and also add to the prestige
and international influence of the great Re
public.
We are certain that in this you will have the
practically unanimous support of your coun
trymen and of the Congress representing
them. It will be a glorious beneficence added
to your administration, and will carry your
name in honor to posterity as the American
President who took the initiative in uniting
the two great oceans, and securing an Ameri
can canal under American control for the
prosperity and glory of the great Republic,
which has twice honored him with the chief
magistracy.
The Dilis now before both houses of Congress
with favorable recommendations of the com
mittees that have had them under considera
tion, with your poweiful approval in the forth
coming message to Congress, and your hon
orable influence supporting our position
thereafter, will assure us this legislation bo
long promised and of such importance to our
country. With the earnest hope that you will
favorably regard our Detition and with assur
ances of our high respect, we subscribe our
seives your obedient servants.
The Chamber of Commerce of San Fbancisco.
Hugh Craig, President.
Attest: William L. Merry,
Secretary and Treasurer.
This was signed by all the members of
the chamber. A similar communication
was addressed to the Pacific Coast delega
tion in Congress.

PREPARING 10
SAVE MARINERS
The Life-Saving Service
Being Put in Perfect
Order.
Several New Stations to Be
Built on This Coast Very
Soon.
A LETTER OF APPRECIATION.
How Those on the Wrecked Steamer
Arago at Coos Bay Were Res
cued From Death.
The approach of winter and the storms
that are always expected at this period of
the year has caused Major Blakeney of
the life-saving service to order the men
under his charge at the several stations in
this district to put the stations, boats and
life-saving appurtenances in perfect orJer.
Not that these are ever out of order, but
the major is always more anxious at this
season to have everything ready at a sec
ond's notice for an emergency call. Every
thing is now in perfect working order.
In discussing the service Major Blake
ney stated that there is more saved to the
mariner by prevention than by actual
work when there is occasion for action.
To illustrate this he cited the lite-saving
station at Point Reyes. Prior to the con
struction and equipment of that station
not a winter passed but that some vessel
went ashore in that locality, and the
wrecks were disastrous to life and prop
erty. Since the station and crew have
been mere only one wreck has occurred,
and that was a small lumber schooner
that was driven ashore by a severe storm.
The crew was saved by the station crew.
The reason tor it Is that in all weather the
men patrol the beach &nd cliffs day and
night and upon the approach of a v?ssel
warning sienals, such as rockets and gu:.s,
are Bet off in time to warn the mariner of
his danger. Many a vessel has thus been
saved by the coast guard. Another illus
tration lies nearer home. Many a vessel
went ashore on the San Francisco coast
prior to the establishment of the stations
here. All thai have gone ashore since
were driven in by adverse tides, against
which they were powerless because of the
lack of wind or poor steering apparatus.
They were warned just the same.
While those who have been benefited
by this important service deeply appreci
ate the good it does, fhe general public is
not always well informed as to t'lie sterl
ing merit of the life-savers. There was
one unfortunate crew who recently had
cause to appreciate the service and also
the fact that Major Blakeney had changed
a station so that the life-saver* could be of
use to those in distress. On this point the
following letter is self-explanatory :
San Francisco, Nov. 4.
Major T. J. B'akeney, Superintendent Tvcefth j
Uniud States Life-saving Districtâ Dear Sin: I
take pleasure in writing you a few lines re- |
garding the wreck oi the sttamship Arago near i
Coos Bay jetty on October 20, 1896, and ihe !
performance of the lile-saving crew on that oc- i
casion, particularly Captain Haynes, who was !
in command of the lifeboat on that occasion.
I would state that when the lifeboat ap
peared inside of the jetty she was making al
most steamboat time and against a strong
flood tide, which convinced me that they were I
and had been from the time they knew of our
pl.ght doing all in their power ior us. After!
tretting to the north side of the wreck (a job
that required great courage and skill on the
part of Captain Haynes and great strength
and endurance on the part of the crew, who,
had they not been well drilled, would, I be
lieve, have been too much exhausted by the I
long pull they had from the station to the end
ot the jetty, to have performed it), several at
tempts were made to get us a line beiore it was
Bccompllshedâ every attempt at the peril of
the lives oi the entire life-saving crew.
After getting the line to us Captain Haynes
instructed us to haul in and bend the hawser
onto one man at a time and have him jump
overboard and they would haul him into the
lifeboat, which they did until there were but
three of us left. Then as all indications were
that the mast would soon fall, Captain Haynes
told me not to wait to haul in the hawser but
bend the line we had around all three of us a
little space between us, and he would haul us
all at once, which we did. Captain Haynes
and his crew saved ail the men on the wreck
when he got to it.
I muit thank you for the lives of all of us
who were rescued by the United State Life
Service crew, for I believe that It was through i
your efforts that the life-saving station was
changed from Cape Arago, from where no life
boat could have reached uÂ» that day or the
next. Yours respectfully, a. Reed,
Master steamship Arago.
The bureau at Washington is at present
con.einplating the enlargement of the
service on this coast. One improvement
will be the erection of a life-saving sta
tion at Grays Harbor where the British
bark Zinita went ashore two days ago. A
site was purchased there five years ago
and the plans are being prepared at Wash
ington. It will be iully equipped with all
modern life-saving apparatus"
Probably the first station to be con
structed and put in order wili be that on
the outside of Point Bonita a little above
the lighthouse. Its construction was au
thorized by the last Congress, but the site
is not yet selected. It will consist of a
modern builditjg, boats, etc. Inside of
the point in what is known as Pilot
Cove, another or auxiliary station will be
erected and provided with boars, chute
and all that will be necessary. One large
crew will be sufficient for both places.
Tlie idea is that in a northwest storm
when a t oat cannot be launched from the
ocean side, the crew will cross the low hill
and launch the boat in the Pilot Cove sta
tion and proceed out to the vessel in dis
tress. W nen the storm is from the south
or southeast the outside boat will be
launched when necessary. When the new
station is established it is believed that
the coast guard patrol service will save ail
kinds of water craft, even from the ap
proach of dancer.

.elect James D. Fhelan . and Dr. Beverley
K. Cole constituted the gallery.
. Contrary to the usual fashion, an ap
plication of Professor Gayley to be grant
.cd leave of absence for one year encoun
tered some resistance. The committee had
â¢r'eportea in favor of the request. Colonel
â¢Crocker asked the president of the uni
versity to make a statement of the case to
the regents. It was then stated by Presi
dent Kellogg that Professor Gayley con
templated going abroad to till an im
'vortant literary engagement in London
.with "the great publishrhp-house of Mac
.millan & Co. The professor had been ap
pointed as chief editor of an important
work on the comedy side of the English
drama. His sojourn abroad and his
, duties as editor would bring him into
close contact with the most advanced Eng
'â lish men of letters, and thus enable the
*" professor to broaden himself. It was
broadly indicated that all the new knowl
, edge that Mr. Gayley would acquire while
rubbing up against English talent in let
ters would be unloaded in due time at
. Berkeley to the everlasting literary emi
nence of that classic spot.
The Governor signified his willingness
â¢ to vote for the leave.
,â¢â¢ Another regent dwelt upon the glory
which would be shed upon California by
â¢ one of on professors editing a vast work
on the English drama for the "McMul
lens."
. " Mr. Hallidie remarked that the State of
California was called on to contribute
$3000 to the great work.
Judge Slack explained that Professor
Gayley would secure very little pecuniary
compensation for the work. The pro
fessor had been selected in preference to
other eminent sboiars to perform, the
Â work.
The fact was brought out in the discus
sion that Professor Gayley lias taught
eight years at Berkeley. It was acknowl
. edged by all that the literary engagement
"would bring him in close touch with men
' of letters in England, but the argument
did not s cure a unanimous vote.
Judge Wallace, Chester Rowell, T. G.
Phelpsand A. S. Hallidie put themselves
on record as against the leave of absence,
but a majority voted in favor of the appii
catio.n.
It is assumed that Professor Gayley will
return to Berkeley at the expiration of his
â¢ leave of absence, if he should elect to
resign and remain abroad for an indefinite
. career of broadening the regents could do
nothing but regret hi* absence.
"The subject of Affiliated Colleges was
"taken up out of order. Major Mhoon sub
> "mitted a communication irom Attorney-
General Fitzgerald. The letter of the
Attorney-General cites section 6, article X,
of the constitution, providing that the
labor of convicts shall not be let out by
contract. It was bis opinion that the con
â¢ tract between the regents and the Ray
Construction Company for Folsom granite
was a direct violation of the letter and
spirit- of the constitution. The Attorney-
General wrote that he could not approve
the contract until the provision touching
Folsom granite was eliminated.
Governor Buddâ l am not convinced
â¢ that all the facts were presented to the
. Attorney-General. The constitution of
, 1870 provides that the work of prison
â  labor should not be used for the benefit of
contractors. The regents carefully con
- sidered this provision, and in order to
ma.ke the record unassailable adopted a
â¢ resolution a long time ago assuring the
State Board of Prison Directors that the
â¢ benefit from the use of the prison labor
would inure exclusively to the State.
' That matter, 1 think, was not explained
" to the Attorney-General. Unless he modi
lies bis: opinion we shall surely lose the
Sutro site, and perhaps the appropriation
may be lost. I think the matter should
â¢ bi referred to the law committee.
Major Mhoonâ l presented these con
. tracts to the Attorney-General. He called
Imy attention to the points of objection.
â¢ The first point he made was against the
' use of Folsom granite, and the second
0 was that contracts for $248,000 had been
,-' awarded when only $125,000 was available.
He receded from the second point on con
sidering that $250,000 had been appropri
ated. I did all I could to convince the
Attorney-General that thÂ» granite was for
the exclusive use of the State and not for
, the benefit of contractors. The Attorney-
General denies his power to approve con
tracts from tbe law of 1876. It is a ques
tion whether the board is subject to that
law, but it would be easier to go before the
Legislature than take tne question to the
Supreme Court. We might submit the
question to the Supreme Court to ascer
tain if the act of 1876 governs the regents
Judge Wallace refreshed the regents
with an elaborate and lucid argument.
He said: "I have always maintained that
the act of 1876 has no reference, to the
university. The Supreme Court has es
tablished by two decisionsâ if decisions of
that court* can establish anythingâ that
the act of 1876 does not apply to the re
gents. The constitution declares that the
regents have/an independent existence,
subject only to the act of 1868 and acts
amendatory thereof. Why, the law has
â¢ not been repealed which provides that a
person holding a judicial position shall
not bold an executive office. That law
exists, but it has no force. If it were in
lorce Judge Slack and myself could not
serve on this board. I know the Attor
ney-General very well, and to my mind
' no one surpasses him in ability or hon
esty, but we have heard that even Homer
nodded. Fitzgerald has nodded in this.
We all know that the policy of the law is
to cherish free labor. We are not crowd
. ing free labor. Prison labor is quarrying
â  granite all the time. After it is lilted out
of the earth free labor takes it; Is tn<!re
any law to prevent the State from quarry
ing on State property? We propose to
I use this granite for the benefit of the State,
â¢ not for the benefit of : the contractors.
A?ne Attorney-General misunderstands
T|ie facts. So obviously is there a funda
â¢ mental error on the Attorney-General a
part that we cannot pass.it by without
notice. lam not anxious to throw myself,
into opposition to the r Attorney-General -
a man for whom I entertain so much re
spect. .The constitution says that the con
victs must be worked for; the benefit* of
the State. The manufacture of jute bags!
is much mere in opposition to free labor
ihan the quarrying of stone. It would be
absurd to say tbat cooks should be em
ployed to prepare the m^als for con
victs, but cooking is free labor and
& labor that we appreciate. The
Attorney-General has gone wrong on this
proposition. He entertains the idea tbat
contractors are to be benefited. We owe
it to ourselves to go along with this work.
We have possession of a site worth $80,000.
Sutro is tired and will not grant another
extension. I propose that we shall not re
linquish our possession. The work is go
ing forward now and we should not be
balked. Let us go forward. If we are
weak enough to let co we ouglit to lose.
It is said already that we have not shown
capacity for business. The people do not
understand the facts. They do not know
wuat these regents, who receive no com
pensation but give their time and talents
to the State, have <lone. Mow here is this
institution of Affiliated Colleges. The
people want itâ lree labor vrants it. What
is the reason we cannot hold on until the
Legislature meets? This is an emergency,
and I hope that we will stand by our guns.
I will undertake to show that this con
tract does not require the approval of the
Attorney-General."
Regent Footeâ l am absolutely of the
opinion that this contract is valid without
the approval of the Attorney-General. I
agree fully with Judge Wallace. 1 hava
known the Attorney-General for forty
years, and know that he is the peer in in
tellect and character of any man in the
State. We should do him the courtesy of
presenting to his notice Judge Wallace's
lucid arguoipnt.
Governor Buddâ While Judge Wallace
may be correct as to the rights of the
Board of Regents under the constitution,
we must Dear in mind the conditions con
tained in the act appropriating money for
these buildings. The Attorney-General is
a member of the Board of Examiners.
Before one dollar can be drawn from the
treasury his approval must be obtained.
He is the legal adviser of the board. He
is a good fighter wben he is aroused, and
if this board thinks it can ignore the At
torney-General and co on with the build
ing it will rind construction long delayed.
I suggest that the law committee submit
to him all the facts.
Judge Wallaceâ Suppose we invite the
Attorney-General to meet this board.
Regent Pheipsâ Let us receive the ap
proval of the Attorney-General if possi
ble, but I do not propose to relax work or
relinquish the site. 1 move that the law
committee wait on the Attorney-General
and request him to meet with us next
Saturday afternoon.
The motion prevailed.
When the Wilmerding School matter
was called Mr. Pbelps moved a postpone
ment for three months.
Colonel Crocker opposed delay, remark
ing that a number came to the meeting
for the special purpose of considering thai
subject.
Judge Wallace â Why postpone it? We
are losing caste before the public. The
people be in to think we cannot do busi
ness. It is talked of everywhere. It is in
tiie newspapers.
Governor Budd â Is it in the newspapers?
Judge Wailace(resuming) â Why the peo
ple s:Â»y here is a man who gives us $400,000
and we do not use it. We postpone action
from June to November. We will get no
more money if sach a course continues.
People will say that we do not know what
to do with it.
Regent Hallidie advised against haste.
He said the fund was increasing $3000 a
month, and held that the plan of the
school should be determined before the
sight was selected.
Regent Reinstein held that the trust
would not be prejudiced by delay. He in
timated that the selection of a site at the
present time m ght array hostility to the
university in the Legislature.
Judge Wallace opposed the policy of
temporizing. "The safest way is to go
ahead and do our duty without regard to
consequences. If we do nothing the Leg
islature will cay that we cannot use the
$400,000 given to us."
Regent Puelpsâ The location is ths Jast
thing to be thought of. Our first duty is
to establish the character and scope of the
school.
Recent Martin opposed the idea of
locating the school away from the univer
sity and the influences of that institution.
He was sure that Mr. Wilmerding made
the gift with the idea in his mind that the
school should be under the immediate di
rection of the univeroit}'.
Governor Budd, addressing Regent
Reinstein, said: "You were the first to
introduce the idea that the Legislature
would be hostile after the location. Stock
ton will not carry the feeling to the Legis
lature. I have been charged by the news
papers with packing this board in the in
terest of Stockton. Now three of the four
regents that I appointed are going to vote
against my own town. I bavo not used
my position as Governor to influence any
one's vote. 1 think I have shown as Gov
ernor that I cannot be turned aside by
force or persuasion. To in/ mind Ala
meaa County is showing a little selfish
ness, considering that Mrs. Hearst is to
expend $750,000" at Berkeley and that
Reinstein Knows a man who is going to
expend $1,000,000. There will be no feel
ing in S toe k ton over the location and I
don't see why there should be any in Aia
meda or San Francisco."
Regent Marye insisted that there was no
call for haste/as the money was accumu
lating.
Regent Hallidie had many facts, the re
sult of twenty years' study of trade schools,
to submit to the board.
The Doaid agreed to postpone action on
the subject until next Tuesday.

WILL LOOK AFTER
FISH AND GAME
Governor Budd Appoints
Alex Vogelsang a Com
missioner.
The Young Attorney Will En
deavor to P ease Anglers
and SpDrtsmen.
FLY-CASTING CLUB DELIGHTFD
The New Fish Commissioner Wou'd
Be Pleased to See a Gams
Warden Appointed.
Governor Budd has appointed Alexan
der T. Vogelsang a Fish and Game Com
missioner, to fill the place left vacant by
the resignation of William C. Murdoch.
Mr. Vogelsang, who is a young attorney
of this City, is well and favorably known
to the angling fraternity. He is the sec
retary of the San Francisco Fly- Casting
A* Vogelsang.
Club and a great lover of angling. In
reply to a question as to what policy he
intended to pursue as a representative of
the State Fish Commission Mr. Vogel
sang was a little tardy at first in express
ing his views, but after warming up to
the situation he said that he would do all
in his province to cater to the wishes and
desires of both sportsmen and anglers.
'â¢To be candid with you," said Mr.
Vogelsang, "I cannot say anything at
present, as I am not in touch with the du
ties of a Fish Commissioner. Yon can rest
assured, however, that I will do all in my
power to please the anglers and sports
men of this State. This being an honor
ary position I havo accepted of it because
of my love for the sport. It's a thankless
office which is sought after only by those
who have an interest in the propagation
and protection of both game and fish. I
am a strong advocaie of protection to
game ana particularly during the breed
ing season.
"As the Fish Commissioners have their
hands full in looking out for the interest
of game fishesâ that is with the small
force of deputies at their command â I
think that the game aide of the question
(I now refer to birds and animals) should
be under the supervision of a game
warden.
"I understand that in many of thÂ« East
ern States two officers are appointed, viz. :
a game commissioner or warden, whose
duty is to look aiter the interests of game
birds and animals, and a fish commis
sioner, whose duties do not in any way
interfere with those of the game warden.
From what I can glean through exchanges
that are devoted to sports of field and
stream, the two offices work in harmony,
and the result gives general satistaction to
botn sportsmen and anglers."
Relative to ihe changes that have been
made in the opening of the game-shooting
season, Mr. Vogelsang said that he did
not approve of the alteration in the old
game law.
"I contend," said the speaker, "that
the market hunter should be permitted to
kill and ship game after the loth of Octo
ber 1, upon which date the sportsman is
allowed by law to kill game for the sport
of killing and the pleasure of the eating of
whatever bird or animal that falls to his
gun. If the object ol the law so framed is
to protect tbe young birds and animals
from slaughter, then why should not the
sportsman refrain from shooting game
until such time as the market, hunter is
allowed the privilege?
"I do not oelieve ; n class legislation,
and I think that there are many defects
in the present game laws, which should
be rectified. However, the sportsmen and
anglers of this State can rest assured that
I will do all in my province fur the better
interests of pame and fish."
NEW BUNKO GAME.
How " Billy" f-olan tame to Part Witli
n Dollar and the Kxlciit of

The bunko men who are out for small
money have struck a new scheme which
they call t!ie "telephone graft," and busi
ness men about town have grown ex
tremely careful how they grant requests
for ynall pecuniary favors when they come
over the phone.
The manner in which "Billy" Nolan
one of the shoe-firmâ was "worked" a day
or bo a^o, illustrates how the thing is done.
About 5 o'clock in the afternoon his
telephone rang up, and some one said:
"Cail Mr. Nolan to the telephone,
please."
"This is Mr. Nolan," answered theshoe
man.
â¢Oh, hello, Nolan!" said the voice, "this
There Is Strength and Health in This Qreat=
est of Discoveries !
At Every Stage of Life Where Renewed Nervous Energy, Pure Blood, Freedom from
Pain, and Normal Conditions Are Despaired of Paine's Celery Compound Is the One
Remedy That Will Make You Well!
The first women in the land have good reason to recommend to every euffere r
Paine's celery compound.
The proprietors of Paine's celery compound are not "patent medicine men."
They claim not one whit more for this jvonderf ul remedy than it will accomplish.
They resort to no schemes to sell it ; they offer no prizes. They believe i a the only
kind ol advertising that can be profitable in the end; that is tne recommendations
that go by letter or word of mouth from those whom Paine's celery compound has
benefited, to suffering friends relatives and neighbors. The proprietors ot this rem-
edy have given out for publication the voluntary testimonials of grateful women and
men, who owe their health to Paine's celery compound; they never change a writer's
words or exaggerate a person's importance; they never placard a plain citizen with
titles; they never call a simple cure a miracle.
Paine's celery compound is to-day the least advertised of any prominent re medy,
and yet its output is far Kreater than them all. The demand for Paine's celery com-
pound is steadily, daily growing, while the sales of every one of the artfully but dis-
honestly advertised "patent medicines" are fast dropping off.
Although wi! bin a year the most astonishing numb r of people in high society,

izens, such people as for instance, Mrs. Senator Quay, Mr 3. Dr. Parkhurst, Elizabeth

Nolan knew PringlÂ», so he said "All
rig t," and thought no more about it.
About 6:30 that evening a ycung man
calied on Nolan and handed him an en
velope which was addressod to "Mr.
Pringl<\" but which he said wa3 to be left
with Nolan if the former was not at his
place of business. He stood about after
delivering the message, and Nolan asked
nim about charges.
"I came from San Rafael," said the
man. "and it will be a doilar."
The money was paid over and the mes
senger departed. Prinele did not show
up the next day, and Nolan delivered the
note in person with an explanation.
"Why I did not telephone to you," said
Pringie, opening the note wonderingly.
Then he handed the missive to Nolan,
who read one word and only one, and that
was "Rats." Then light dawned on both.
GREEN - EYED MONSTER
Mrs. Francisca Duve of Valleja
Street Chastises Her
Husband.
H9 H?.d Her Arrested for Battery,
but Acting Police Judga Barry
Dismiss d the Case.
An amusing case was heard yesterday
morning by Jnstice cf the Peace Barry,
who is occupying the bench in Judge Con
lan's court ior a few days auring the
latter's absence.
The parties to the case were Albert
Duve, 651 Vallejo street, and hia wife
Francisca. Duve is 22 years of age, small
in stature and of spare build. His wife is
a big, stout woman, about double his age
and size.
Francisca had been arrested on the com
plaint of her husband for battery upon
him. Albert took the stand and told in
an excited manner how he had gone home
Monday night and his wife commenced at
once to revile him. She called him all
all sorts of names, and wound up by se'z
ing him by the collar and throwing him
on the floor. While in this position she
whacked him over the back with an um
brella till his bones ached, and finished up
by striking him repeatedly with her fists.
"What was the matter with her?" asked
the Judze.
"She accused me of coins with young
girls and neglecting her, but it isn't true."
Mrs. Duve, with her black eyes snap
ping, admitted that nhe had punished Al
bert and said he deserved it.
"He was with two young girls last
night," she said, "and he is always with
them. I wanted him to give me money to
get a divorce from him, and when he re
fused 1 loat my temper and chastised
him."
"Are you jealous of him?" asked the
Judge.
She looked at Albert for a minute with
a sneer upon her face, and with a toss of
her head said: "Well, yes, I am. He is
mv husband."
The Judge dismissed the case, and ad
vised Albert to take the initiative and ap
ply for a divgrce on the ground of cruelty.
BEAR CLUB.
Ita Member* Were Except ionally Sue-
cessful in the Selection.
An after- election meeting of the Bear
Club was held Monday evening last at
B'nai B'rith Hall, E ldy street, Vice-
President I. P. Kincaid in the chair, E. N.
Maison secretary. A report from the
finance committee shows the club to be
in good condition. A vote of thanks was
tendered to Treasurer O=car Tollo for his
ever-timely aid.
A review of the candidates at the last
election showed that nineteen members of
the Bear Club had been successful. The
three newly eieoted Republican members
of the Board of Supervisors, as well as the
lour Republican members of the Board of
Education, are members of this club. The
only Republican Senator elr-cted in this
City, Ed. I. Wolfe, is one cf the earliest
memberÃ of this organization. The Su
perior and Police Judges and Justices ol
the Peace %re also enrolled in its mem
bership. Some of the Assemblymen are
found there too.
Some suggestions were maae by J. F.
Gawthorne for continuing the active life
of the club right along, to keep it in effi
cient working order for the next cam
paign. The idea was ably supported by
E. J. Casey, and on motion the subject
was referred to the executive committee
to formulate a plan to cover the sugges
tions.

THE WONDERFUL X-RAY
Its Incalculable Benefit to the
Physician cr Surgeon
Doctor Cock, the First Specialist on
tbe Pacific Coast to Operate
ihe X-Ray.
Few events of modern ages hava so
greatly agitated the scientific world as
Prof. Roentgen's discovery of the X-Ray.
By its aid the physician or surgeon can
look farther into the mysteries of life and
penetrate deeper the secrets of disease
than has ever before been done by human
eyes. The living skeleton is laid bare.
Flesh becomes as transparent as crystal.
Tne exact position of tbe bullet, fracture,
tumor and other diseases or deformities of
tne internal organs is easily located and
plainly seen.
The mammoth X-Ray now in use by
Doctor Cook is of the very best and latest
improved edition, and shows beyond the
shadow of a question that this distin
guished specialist is strictly up to date in
everything pertaining to his profession.
Others may follow, bai he leads. He does
not cling to old ideas now moss-covered
and obsolete. He turns his face to the
front, and with lofty ambition and noble
purpose strives for the laurels of the
present and future. He is resolutely de
termined to make still more complete his
already unequaled success.
Doctor Cook restores Failing Manhood
to men of all ages and removes from them
every symptom of physical, mental or
sexual weakness. He also cures Gonor
rhoea, Gleet, Stricture, Varicocele, Hydro
cele, Piies. Fistula, Rupture, Chronic
Catarrh, Blood and Skin Diseases and

Still Higher Prices f>r Wheat Indicated
From in editorial in a recent issue of Brad
â¢treet's, headed '-The Outlook lor w heut Prices.'
the followina; extract is taken: The domestic crop,
recently estimated on the basis of the Agricultural
Department report at 41 2,000. 000 bushels, is now
laid Dy studunts of the Government report to be
' likely to amount to 435,0 JO.OOO bushels. Against
this it is argued that an 80.000 000 bushels short
age In the leading Spring Wheat states means jusi
that much less W eat produced this year than
last. Tnere are prominent millers, elevator men
ann others whoareue from the foregoing that the
1896 'iomestic crop amounts to only about 887,
-000,000 bushelsâ because t he i^oveni ment reported
a to ai crop last yeiir 01 only 467,000.000 bushels.
To be sure, staiistics of ihe distribution of ihe
1895 crop paint to it having b.-en nearer Â00.000.-
-000.hail 467,000.000 busneis. bui the authorities
referred to do not seem .0 place any
weichi on that. But if we presume
thÂ«t the 1896 crop Is only 400,000,000
bnsheU, us so many in pos'lon to judte nave de
clared, and add Â0 it t O.OCO 00.) bushels available
from the quantity carried ver on July 1, 1895, we
find a jtrand total for use at home and abroad of
460.000.000 bushels. Of this, 37* 000,000 bushels
are estiniEteU as ne.-ded at home for food and
seed, leaving only 82,000,000 for export,
to June BJ. 1897. Ue havr already ex|>orted
about 55,000.000 bushels, leaving ouly 27,000.000
bushels to ship oat of the country during the neit
eight mouths, about 750.0U0 bushels per week,
about one-tiith wliai we are now Shipping weekly.
If mis sl'ua-.ion were g nerally aptirei iated or be
lieved "dollar wheat" wou:d soon bt- a reality. l'o
our extremely Dullish friends iv the Northwest
beii.ve the domestic wheat supply is as short as
this? The 1 rice 01 wheai will probably have to
ndvancp above recent high levels, even if the crop
Is 450.0U0,000 or more, which is noi unlikely.
rip'HDKClnu,
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fignrea
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; tlio-e underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure: iso
therms, or dolled lines, equal temperature. The
word "hlirh" means hlsh barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied* by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
nd accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coas'. warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

In addition the advocates of higher prices for

A Little African Allegory.
Makamda, Makanjira's embassador, told
the following story on coming to the fort.
He said that among the animals the rab
bit had the reputation of knowing pood
places in the lorest and on the plains.
When elephants, zebras, leopards and even
lions decided udod having some jollifica
tion, they called in a rabbit and asked
him to provide a suitable place for the en
tertainment. He also wÂ«s supposed to be
an expert at drumming. Then Makamda
said, "I am the rabbit, and I come Irom
Makanjira; he is the lion, and sends me
to search a suitable place."â August Cen
tury.

Recent Letters That Did
Not Produce the De

Dr. Brcwn's Nemesis Will Not
â¢Swear to Her Confession
Before a Notary.
MRS. TUNNEL! SUSTAINS IT.
The Committee of Three Wili Force
. the Dubuqu< Association to
Discard Brown.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 10. )
A rer7 interesting correspondence be
tween Rev. J. K. McLean, D.D., and
Miss Mattie Overman has just closed and
will play an important part in the future
of Rev. C. O. Brown, now of the Dubuque
conference. It will depend solely on Dr.
Brown whether or not the committee ap
' pointed a week ago make public the con-
Session of Miss Overman mailed by her to
Dr. McLean three months ago.
The Bay Conference decided that it was
absolutely necessary that the confession
' of Miss Overman should be sworn to be
fore a notary. S. W. Condon, an attor
ney, and who is president of the Alameda
County Christian Endeavor Union, was
engaged to prepare an affidavit embody
ing the points in Miss Overman's written
confession. The document when pre
. p.ared was sent to Miss Overman by Dr.
. McLean, with a request that she take it
. â¢ belore a notary and swear to it.
..â¢ Dr. McLean received a reply in which
Miss Overman refused to swear to it. It
. was very evident that she did not intend
â¢ to willfully commit perjury. She replied
that she would not swear to her con
fession and referred to the fact that she
had once taken an oath and had imme
diately afterward told a multitude of false
hoods. She concluded by saying that she
did not intend to take any more oaths.
â¢ In this letter she told Dr. McLean that
â¢ she had only done her duty and had writ
ten nothing but the truth. She had for
given Dr. Brown and did not cherish any
grudgp against him and lad no desire to
enter into any spile work against the best
interests of Dr. Brown. She concluded
by ssying that the matter wa3 row in the
hands of the Lord and that he was at
tending to Dr. Brown and would not let
him remain in any pulpit or do anything
that would hurt the cause of Christ on
earth.
"I wrote hacK," said Dr. McLean to-day,
"t&lling Mies Overman that it was all very
well to say that the matter was in the
hands of the Lord, but that we also in
tended to take a hand in the matter.
Brown is back in the field at present and
â  is telling falsehoods by wholesale, and tht
Buy Association will be held respon>ille
if he doca in another chnrch as he did in
â¢- San Francisco. I lold her that it was
necessary for us to have sworn statements
only for use in case we needed them in
the future."
. This letter of Dr. McLean was un
answered for two weeks, and then the
affidavit came back. It was not sworn to
before r notary, but was 6igned by Miss
Overman, who reiterated her statement
that it was true. Accompanying it was a
short note, in which Mis-s Overman prac
tically said that she would not take any
more trouble to please the ministers.
Attorney Condon then procured an affi
davit ;rom Mrs. Tunnell supporting the
statements of Mattie Overman. These
documents are now held by the committee
appointed a couple of weeks ago, and will
probably remain secret.
." '"Il I had my way," said Dr. McLean
to-night, "I would eliminate one para
graph in Miss Overman's statement and
would give the whole thing out for publi
cation. My reason for leaving out that
one paragraph is that it contains a refer
ence to an innocent party and would worK
a hardship on one who had no part in the
scandal. I am guided, however, by the
will of the majority, and the affidavits
just obtained will be held against iirown
lor all time.
"The Dubuque conference, which re
cently took Brown in fellowship, did not
fully understand the situation, and I have
every confidence that it wili rescind its
former action. The vote to admit Brown
was only 22 to 17, and a majority of the
majority were votes of the church that
wanted him ana of the church where his
son is pastor.
"Dr. Brown is now deliberately lying In
the East, but it will not be for long. I
Samuel Spackman, Who "Wandered About for Two Months and
Can Recall Nothing.
am more convinced to-day than ever of
the justness of the manner in which he
was treated and our duty in the matter is
very plain. The committee thai now has
the matter in hand is working hard and
will push the matter vigorously. They
will not lay their affidavits before the
Dubuque conference unless the conference
refuses to accede to the request and acqui
esce in the judgment of the Bay Associa
tion. If not, tnen we snail be forced to
send those affidavits East and use them as
evidence. Brown ia now without stand
ing in the Christian ministry and must be
kept out of the pulpit. If it should be
come necessary to make these things pub
lic I would Ike to see them telegraphed
all over the country. We do not wish to
do anything; except what is necessary to
preserve the dipnity and sanctity of the
roinistrj 7 , but I cannot tell what the com
mittee may yet be compelled to do."
Miss Overman's refusal to swear to tes
timony which is so widely different from
what she swore to at the trial is regarded
as a very shrewd action on her part. To
have sworn twice would, it is stated, ren
der her amenable to the courts.
It is understood that Mrs Davidson, one
of the principals in the celebrated scandal,
has left San Francisco.

a coupie of weeKs ago and whose where
abouts Las ever since been a mystery, is
acain at home, having been brought in
from Berkeley late last night by Marshal
Lloyd and placed In the County Jail on a
charge of insanity. He was found wan
dcrinK about the university grounds sadly
demented, aLd his emaciated condition
indicated that he must have suffered se
verely from deprivation, starvation and
exposure.
When found he was clothed only in old
ragged overalls and in an old blanket.
He had no shoes, hat. or coat, and was
weak and shivering irom the cold and
could tell nothing about himself, but
seemed to be wandering in his mind. Tlie
Marshal took him home and gave him a
meal, which he devoured ravenously. He
a .mitteil that his name wa? Spademan,
but could not tell where he had been. At
the jail ne was identified by several who
knew him beiore his wife and child were
brought in.
While at work at the racetrack for the
California Jockey Club a board fell and
struck him on the head. He never eeeniea
to be just right after this, and when he
disappeared ii was supposed he had killed
himself.

Dr. F. H. Payne of the
State University Seri
ously Hurt.
His Head Struck a Stone and
His Skull May Be
Fractured.
PHYSICIANS VERY ANXIOUS
The Animal Fe 1 Also, and
Nearly Crushed Its
Rider.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 10.â Dr. F. H.
Payne, examining surgeon to the depart
ments of physical culture and military
science at the State University, and one of
the best-known physicians on this side of
the bay, was thrown from a horsa at
about 1 o'clock this afternoon, and re
ceived such injuries that grave doubts are
expressed as to his recovery. He was
picked up in an unconscious condition
DR. F. H. PAYNE.
and up till a late hour to-night he had not
regained his normal state. The most dan
gerous of all the wounds he sustained is a
deep cut on the forehead, about two inches
in length. His face was also lacerated in
a frightful manner.
On account of his comatose condition it
has been impossible to make a complete
and thorough examination as to all his
wounds, and fears are expressed by the
surgeons in attendance that his skull is
fractured and that he has been injured
internally along the region of the spine.
At about 1 o'clock the doctor left North
Hall at the university, on horseback, and
as he started out hii horse gave a lunge
and broke the martingale. The animal
became unmanageable and ran down the
hill, through the south entrance to the
grounds, down Allston way. and wa-i
ahout to turn up Oxford street, when he
slipped and fell over the stone sidewalk,
carrying the doctor with him. In lailing
Dr. Payne is supposed tn have struck on a
huge bowlder lying near, at the same time
receiving the whole weight of the horse
upon him.
The patient is regarded as in a critical
condition.
Mrs. Towmend'i Case.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 10.â The Board

j to settle the long-fought Townsend case.
I Last night at the board meeting President

Bet TheJr Hair.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 10.â The ex
traordinary sight of one college student
performing the office of a tonsorial artist
on a fellow-collegian, within the public
gaze, too* place- this afternoon at the uni
versity. Charles Jones '99 and J. A. Mc-
Gee of the same class bet on the election
the penalty o! the loaer being that he
should be shorn in whatsoever style the
other chose, within sight of the whole
university. Jones wagered his hair on
Bryan and McGee put up his capillary
substance on McKiniey. Of course McGee
won the bet. At the appointed time he
appeared with bis scissors and a small red
comb, the latter to match the hair ol
Jones. Btudents by the score gathered
round to see the fun. It was not long be
fore Jones had nothing left but a narrow
strip of his precious red hair running from
bis forehead to the back of his neck. The
rest of his capillary growth was clipped
almost as closely as if it had been shaved.

ent, young and old, to assist in the ser
vices by.tneir presence and co-operation

OAKLAND HARBOR.
Two Town* Talk of Work Done and
-Money Expended.
ALAMEDA, Cal,, Nov. 10.â The recom
mendations of the joint Alameda and Oak
land committee on harbor improvements
were ratified to-night at a mass-meeting
in the City Hall. The only change made
was that in the completion of the harbor
we3t of Webster-street bridge the total
sura of expenditure should not exceed
$300,000.
11 the present money available is not
sufficient to complete the entire work the
two cities urge the appropriation of a suf
ficient fund to do the work. The meeting
was attended by only thirty-five citizens
of !he whole territory interested. Dr. Mc-
Lean read a lengthy statement of the
work done and the cause of the commit
tee's withdrawal from their agreement.
He occupied twenty-five minutes, aftar
which M. J. Keller of Oakland spoke
for ten.
He answered all of the arguments pre
sented and corrected some false statements
made. The Alameda citizens then got
into a wrangle among themselves as to
what they did want. Green Majors, A.
W. Pattianiandl. N. Chapman urged that
Oaklard be allowed to have work done if
Alameda cot nothing at present. After a
two hours' talk the action o! the commit
tee was indorsed with the amendment
noted. City Engineer Poyzer stated that
he was perfectly satisfied with thu- agree
ment as first formulated.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 10.â Ona of the
most interesting and appropriately named

The Rev. E. S. Cnapman Declares
It Is Right's Fight With
Might.
Learned and Intelligent Women Dis
franchised by Ignorant, Low
and Vicious M?n.
Oakland Office Sas Fbancisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Nov. 10. f
The question of suffrage for women is
attracting more attention now than it did
before election. The Rev. E. S. Chapman,
D.D-. pastor of the Market-street Congre
gational Church, has the following to say
on the subject:
The men of our State have voted that the
women of the State shall not be permitted to
i vote. In the exercise of this most exalted and
I sacred ris-tit of an American citizen, the men
I have deliberately and purposely declared that
j Ihn women should not exercise that right to
â  int'n. Htifl they have had no voice in granting
| this right to men, and they have hnd no voice
in deciding whether they should themselves
be in vested with the right of suffrage. The
I men have themselves decided that they will
I vote nnd that this women shall nor. No one
| granted them this privilege, no one was asked
to grant It. tuey simply seized upon it, and by
mere brute force they prevent the women from
securing and exercibing tbig priceless preroga
tive.
The most Ignorant men have voted to dis
franchisa the most learned and intelligent
worn n; indolent nnd worthless men have
voted lo disfranchise women who are among
our largest taxpayers; lr>w, vicious men nave
voted to deny suffrage to our most exalted and
noblewomen. It is a shame that such things
are possible; it is a greater shame that they
are realities. Many noble men from worthy
motives cast their votes against this enfran
chisement of women, otherwise tne sixth
amendment would have been adopted.
The Interests of home aud family are In a
peculiar sense involved in thin struggle for
equal suffrage. We may fittingly adopt the
words o! Nehemsh, "Fight for your sons and
your daughters, your wives nnd your houses."
The Lord has provided that In the coarse of
nature there shall be two mature mlndi be
side every little babe. The cradle is guarded
on either side by n full-grown person, that the
precious life anil priceless Interests it contains
may he secure against the assaults of evil.
Let us continue this struggle with increased
earnestness and vigor. To cease our efforts
now would be to lose nil that we have gained
by the toiis and sacrifices of the past. We
have made great, progress, fully as much as
could ba reasonably expected. Many have
risen up to help us, and they will remain true
to the cause ihey havo espoused, while new
recruits will bo added lo our hosts as the
months go by. The solid ranks of vice and
crime are massed against ns, and their manl
iest hostility will cause the frlenas of good
and pure government to see the rignteousuess
of our cause and to aid us to achieve the
glorious victory which under God will surely
and speedily come.
Will Banquet Irish.
, OAKLAND, Cal.. Nor. 10.â A compli
mentary banquet will be tendered by the
Oakland Business Men's Sound Money
L*apue on Wednesday evening at the
Masonic Temple to John P. Irish in recog
nition of his services to the sound money
cause in the East during the recent politi
cal campaign. There will be an exchange
of views regarding the future work of the

Chinese Evicted.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 10.â The occu
pants of a Chinese lodging-house on
Ninth street, near franklin, were evicted
by the Sheriff this evening. The affair
created much excitement as many of the
Chinese did not understand the nature of
the circumstance. The proprietor who
leased the house is considerably in ar
rears in his rent, but the many occupants
have all paid in advance and to them the
eviction was a hardship. The proprietor
was not on hand and the deputy Sheriff
could not make the lodeers understand
why their chattels were put on the side
walk. Many of them were poor laborers.
This is the first Chinese eviction in this
city as they are generally regarded as
good tenants.
Stood off the Officer.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 10.â Two young
men, giving the names James Carlin and
William Hawley, are in the County Jail
on a charge of ourglary. They came in
on the overland, which was late, last even
ing and were industriously at work taking
overcoats and grips belonging to fellow
passengers. Deputy Bhenff Adam Kell
ner was notihed on the arrival of the train
at the mole and attempted to arrest them,
but one presented a big revolver at his
head with orders to release the other and
tnen both made for the boat. Kellner fol
lowed and with the assistance of the boat
crew placed both under arrest and kept
them at the Harbor Police Station until
this morning, when they were brought
over to,this side.
Taxpayers' Rash.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 10.â Mayor Da
vin has called a special meeting of the City
Council for to-morrow (Wednesday) even
ing to consider the tax-levy ordinance. It
is understood he has a veto message all
prepared, but it is expected that the Coun
cil will pass it over his veto. If this is
done the city Tax Collector will open his,
office Thursday morning at 8:30 for the re
ceipt of taxes and keep it open to 5 each
day and from 7 to 9 each evening for the
accommodation of the public. This will
allow just fifteen business days for thu
collection o: of $20,000 the first installment
of taxes. Taxes become delinquent No
vember 31.
Burglars at Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 10.â This morn
ing when Sol Kahn, the well-known mer
chant, awoke he discovered that a burglar
had been in the Louse during the night.
An entrance had been effected through an
unlocked window and the dining-rcom
ransacked and a quantity of plate valued
at $50 taken. Ths marauder must have
gone to the loom on ths second floor,
occupied by the nurse and children, as
candle grease was found on the dressing
case. This is the third effort to burglarize
the place, the others having been failures.

THE BIG MINES
OF RICH AMADOR
Great Activity and Many
Miners Employed on
the North Side.
Nearly 375 Stamps Are New
Running and the Number
Will Soon Be Doubled.
D. Gutmann of this City, who is en
gaged in mining In Amador County, has
returned here after a visit to various prop
erties there. He said yesterday:
'â¢There is great activity in mining in
Amaaor County. The following mills are
now running: Pioneei, Plymouth, 20
stamps; Bay State, Plymouth, 10 stamps;
Keystone, Amador, 40 stamps; South
Spring Hill, Amador, 40 stamps; Gover,
Dry town, 20 stamps; Wildman-Mahoney,
Suttur, 70 stamps; South Eureta, Jack
son, 20 stamps; Kennedy, Jackson, 10
stamps; Zeila, Jactson, 40 stamps; Union
Consolidated Gold Mining Company,
Wieland, 30 stamps; Reward mine, Pine
Grove, 10 stamps; Gracy (Bryant mill), 10
stamps; Macy, Pioneer, 6 stamps; James,
Pioneer, 5 stamps; Treadwell, SuttÂ«r
Creek, 6 stamps; Wheeler, Plymouth, 5
stamps; Tripp, 10 stamps; Ferrall mine,
10 stamps, making a total of 372 stamps.
"A great deal of prospecting is now be
ing done in the east vein of the mother
lode, on which the Zeila is located. The
Zei.a is one of the oldest in the lode and
could if the same had a good shaft keep
120 stamps running. At present this mine
is being shut down again on account of re
pairs to the shaft, which was sunk in the
ledge and nearly impossible to keep in re
pair. The management has secured a
strip of land east of its shaft and will be
fore long sink a perpendicular shaft to a
depth of 1200 feet â when this mine will
rank :is one of the large gold producers of
the county. It is safe to say that fully
1,000,000 tons of rock have been mined in
this mine the last eighteen years and that
the Zeiio, always considered" a low-grade
propo-ition, has produced fully $5,000,000
in that period, and there is hardly any
doubt that with a good shaft 100,000 tons
of rock can be mined annually for the
fifty years to come, as the ledge averages
thirty feet and the ore chute ia over SUO
feet in length.
"The Bellwether mine, about one mile
north of the Zeila, is being opened up by
a Chicago company. Their new three
compartment is now down 280 feet,
and it is only a matter of time when this
mine will be as big as the Zeila.
'â¢The Jackson Gate adjoins the Bell
wether. There some of the largest crop
pings in the State mark the lode. Their
sUait is down 350 feet, and at their 300
level, where driits are now being run, the
| ledge is over 10U feet wide; the rock is low
grade, but still will pay to mill. All that
is needed there is lots of stamps.
The owners are so well satisfied that they
are now commencing the sinking of a
three-compartment working shaft, which
they intend to sink to a depth of 600 feet
belore crosscut ting.
"The managers of both the Bellwether
and Jackson Gate mines have profited by
I the experience of the Zeila, and they are
sinking their shafts in the country rock
about 50 feet from the vein.
"At the Argonaut mine stations have
been cut on tiie 1150, 1250 and 1350 levels,
and in the 1250 level, going south, there is
12 feet of rock which will mill better than
$50 per ton. Grading for a mill south of
the hoisting works is now being done. The
company has not decided as yet if they
will put up a 40 or a 60 stamp mill. In
the Allen Maximilian property at Sutter
Creek a contract has been let for a 40
-stamp mill costing $31,000, which is to be
nnisued within ninety days.
"The Alma Gold Mining Company is
much encouraged, and has good reasons
for being so, after their diamond drill
went through a ledge 34 feet thick, 890 feet
in their shaft, the core from the drilling
averaging $10 45 3-7. The Alma is situ
ated within the town limits of Jackson,
and is a continuation of the Kennedy and
Argonaut, only one claim being between
the Alma and the Argonaut. The com
pany owns 140 acres of land and has
nearly one-half mile on the lode line. The
shaft has now reached a depth of 910 feet,
has three compartments, and is one of the
best in the county; the shaft is 850 feet in
solid greenstone; for 400 feet the shaft is
perpendicular, and was then turned to an
incline of 63 degrees, this being about tae
dip of the vein.
"The company will sink to 1050 feet and
then commence cutting out stations on the
1000, 900 and 800 levels, and drift on the
vein for four months on each level, when
the mine will be opened up sufficiently to
erect a 40-stamp mill in the early spring.
The machinery at the Alma consists of a
double hoist with a pair of 14x16 ermines,
a three-drill air compressor and all neces
sary appliances. All work done at the
mine has been done with a view to perma
nency, and from present indications it
promises wbea second Kennedy. Nearly
all of the stock of the company is owned
in San Francisco. There has been over
$90,000 invented in opening up this mine,
and by the time the mine is opened up and
a mill erected $140,000 shall have been ex
pended.
"The Anita mine is running a crosscut
from the 500 level to strike the ledge,
wnich is expected to be encountered
within the next 20 feet.
"The Oneida mine is operated by the
London Exploration Company, of which
the preht Rothschilds are at the head.
Ross E. Brown, the eminent mining en
gineer, is in charge ol the work, and no
expense is bein? spared in opening up
this property. Some idea of the inten

tions and expectations of this company
may be learned by the way they are oper
ating. A 500-horsepower direct action
steam hoist is now being put up at the
mine. The cylinders are 20x60 inches and
the hoist has all modern appliances and
attachments. An 80-foot (tallow frame
has also been erected. They are sinking
a perpendicular three-compartment shaft
800 feet west of the ledge. This shaft has
now reached a depth of 525 feet, and will
intersect the ledge at between 1700 and
1800 feet, when work on the mine will be
commenced. The Oneida mine is one of
the old locations of the mother lode and
had been worked to a depth of 1150 feet,
kept aGO-stamp mill going for years, and
produced $8,000,000 to $4,000,000. The
mine is located between the Kennedy and
the South Eureka.
"At the South Eureka the mill has been
shut down temporarily, the rock in the
upper levels not being high grade enough
to pay. A crosscut is now being run from
the shaft at the 1100 level to strike the
ledge, which will take about ten weeks.
After that time the mill will start up
again in rock, which will mill better than
$10 per ton.
"The Wildman-Mahoney mine is run
ning seventy stamps on an average simi
lar 10 the Zeila and is crushing between
7000 and 8000 tons monthly at a cost of
not more than $2 25 per ton for millinjr
and mining. This shows what can be
done in the motner lode under good man
agement. The Wildman has only one
compartment for hoisting. Their shaft is
down 1200 feet and not one of the best. If
they had a shaft like the Oneida, Argo
nout or Alma mining and milling then
would not coat more than $2 a ton.
"The Keystone is running forty stamps
on better rock than the last eighteen
months. The South Spring Hill Consoli
dated is again, with its forty-stamp mill,
on a dividend-paying basis. The Poca
hontas and Loyai lead on being opened
np by an Eastern company. The Central
Eunka has cleaned out the old shaft to
the bottom, 700 feet, and will commence
sinking: to 1000 feet. The Mechanics mine
near Sutter Creek has erected hoisting
works and is now taking out the water
from the old shaft prior to going deeper.
"At the Bay State; on the 600 level,
a very good ledge has been opened up.
The Union Consolidated Gold Mining
Company is starting up its 80-atamp
mill in good rock. They have reached
the 400 level and are now cutting out
a station in sinking a winze from the 800
to the 400 level. Rock has been encoun
tered which will mill from $30 to $40 a
ton. There are immense fissures in this
mine raneing from ten to fifty feet.
Some of the rock is low grade, but by
mixing with the good rock sixty stamp's
can be kept running in $6 rock. The
Union Consolidated Gold Mining Com
pany's possessions are in extent equal to
the Jackson district. This part of the
county is now looked to with great in
terest. In the Pioneer district five or six
mines are being run on a small scale.
The rook there is rich, but still Pioneer is
the district for the poor men and pros
pectors. The Reward mine, near Pine
Grove, is running its 3-stamp mill in $8,
and they have graded out for ten more
stamps. At Volcano the Tunnel claim
cleaned tip $42,000, and Chinamen and
other small claims from $35,000 to $50,000
more."

LITTLE CRIPPLE'S
PECULIAR RACE
It Got Owner Humphrey
and Jockey Ccchran
in Trouble.
Receding in the Betting, the
Gelding Made a Very Poor
Showing.
ftUANTRELI, AT 60 TO 1, WON.
Ostler Joe Gal'op?i In a Winner-Red
dington a Grtat Mud arkâ CharÂ»
treus- II Disgraced.
Little Cripple, the brown gelding owned
by Bookmaker John Humpurey, broke
one of his crutches in the mile and a six
teenth race run at Intrleside yesterday,
and his weak showing evoked a stern re
buke from the officials in the stand. The
gelding opened an especial favorite in the
betting with Ostler Joe, the books laying
8 to 5 asainst either. The wise money
caused the Ostler's price to be cut a trifle,
while Little Cripple went back to twos.
The black horse from Montana made his
own running, and won with charming )
ease from his full sister, Jack Follansbee's
Hermanita. Marcel was third, a bushel
of lengths in front of Cripple. Of course,
those who strung their co n on the
chances of Ostler Joe looked pleased,
while the supporters of Little Cripple wore
a savage and disgruntled look.
The judges promptly suspended Earl
Cochran, wno rode Cripple, and decided
to refuse the entries of Bookmaker Hum
phrey until they are able to make some
sort of an adjustment of the unexpiicable
entanglement. As a fitting finale, the
snowing made by Mr. Humphrey's mare
Chartreuse 11. the 1 to 2 favorite for the ;
hnal race of the day, was another very in- j
teresting pyrotechnical display. Showing
speed in reserve during ihe early stages of
ilie running she stopped to nothing in the I
s:retch, finishing an interesting fourth. |
\V nether the two horses beaten have lost i
the sharp edge they exhibited in former :
races or whether this edge became dulled
irom the short prices laid in the books is '
problematical.
Outside of the win of the 60 to 1 out
sider Q.;antrell in the second maiden two
yeai-oid event, the racing was marked by
nothing eventful. Two of the favorites
oniy were successful, the defeat of the
others being attributed for the most part
to the going, which was muddy. The at
tendance ana betting were quite up to the
average.
Green Morris got Innammator out of
the maiden class. He was an even-money \
choice over nine other youngsters that
had as yet to reach the wire in advanoe of
their fields, and coming from sixth posi
tion in the stretch, won easily from Popin-
jay-
Among the nine starters in the second
division of maiden youngsters February,
looked about the most eligible and was
sent to the post an 11 to 5 favorite. T. |
.Murphy never seemed able to get him to
the front and he finished tiftb. Passing
Alazan below the paddock the rank out
sider Quantrell, with a lad named Claw
son in the saddle, forced into the lead
and finished half a length in advance of
the first-named two-year-old. Jay
Wheeler was third.
W. B. Sink's mare Sister Mary came out
of her long retirement and, as one of the j
seven starters in the fourth race, over
seven furlongs, was made a warm even- j
money chance. She performed very cred
itably, but could never get closer than
two lengths to Redu'ington, who ran like
a wild horse in the heavy going and won
under double wraps. The winner coupled
with Sabeila was held at 2 to 1 in the
books.
Another long-priced outsider crept into
notoriety in the concluding six-furlong <
sprint. After Road Warmer, a 5 to lsho;, I
had led the field to within thirty yards of '
the finishinc post, _nos brought tbe 25 to
1 chance Two Cheers Dp, and in a punish
in drive got the decision by a head in
1:18. St. Aignon was a comfortable third.
Notes.
This will be "ladies' day" at Ingleside,
and six events ate clown for decision on
the card. Secretary Leake says the ladies
are in love with hurdle races, and has fur
nis' ed one for their edification. The card
is one of especial excellence.

salesyard, corner Market street and Van

lions Flambeau, Racine, imp. Cyrus and
Flood are ail represented, and the young
sters are said to be a grand-looking lot.
Ben Benjamin's two-yÂ°ar-old Valdos
made a very creditable showing in the
first race. Had tie not stumbled forty
yards from the wire, the black fellow
would proabably have beaten Popinjay
out fo- place honors.
Moreno, with Golden up. displayed the
Darebin's well-known Jiking for tne mud.
The filly looked like a winner at the head
oi the stretch.
A strong tip was prevalent on Popinjay,
but he is many, many pounds from stake
form.
The purse won by Geyser on Monday
has oeen protest- d by "Curley" Shields,
owner oi the third horse, Sepoy. Mr.
Sh elds claims that Geyser as well as
Scotch Rose, who finished second, are
both owned by J. B. Hacgin. The Turf
Congress rules compel horses running in
the same interests to be coupled in the
betting, otherwise they are liable to dis
qualification. The protest lodged was not
without its effect, for yesterday Sabella
and Reddington, although entered in dif
ferent trainers' names, were coupled in
the betting.
Neither Jack Atkins nor his partner,
Tommy Lottridge, the owners of Quan
trell, bet a dollar on the colt. He was
sick during their Eastern trip, and an
other thing that kept them off was the
presence of Clawson in the saddle. Coady
had been engaged to ride, but as William
Murry, with whom Coady is under con
tract, had an entry in the race, that
jockey could not ride, ana the owners of
Quantrell did not think little Clawson
strong enougn to ride the El Rio Rey
youn ester.
M. E. Casey, a steeplechase rider, got
mixed up is an argument with a couple
of Pinkerton men in the saddling paddock
and was given a rapid walk out the main

George Corbran had a $5 bet on Little
Cripple and George says that Willie
Martin also banked the brown gelding.
Jack Martin, a three-year-old gelalng,

VETTER ESTATE CONTEST.
A Sister of the Decedent Demands
AH the Property.
Mrs. Rosine Grant has filed in Judge
Coffey's court a curt contest to the will of
the late Mrs. Caroline Vetter, which in
strument was offered for probate by P. J.
Vetter who was named as the principal
beneficiary.
Mrs. Grant declares that F. J. Vetter is
not the son of the late Caroline Vetter,
the alleged testatrix, and that Louise
Caroline Vetter, another legatee, is not a
grandchild of the deceased.
The contest lurther sets forth that at
the time Caroline Vetter signed the pre
tended will here mentioned she was suf
fering great physical and mental weak
ness incident to the death of her hus
band, Alfred Vetter; that F. J. Vetier
was residing in the same house with her
and had her under his influence and con
trol; that deceased just prior to her death
revoked said wiil and instructed F. J.
Vetter to destroy it, but that he fraudu
lently failed to do so, purposing to retain
to himself â¢ the advantages that would
accrue if the will should be declared
valid.
Mrs. Grant says that she is a sister of
Mrs. Vetter and is the sole heir to the
estate, whicb is valued at $75,000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOTEMBEH 11, 1896.
A RESERVATION
FOR THE LEPERS
The Novel Scheme Ad
vanced by a Local
Physician.
He Thinks They Should Bi Pro
vided For by the Gov
ernment.
SENATORS FAVJR THE PLAN.
Only Oue Hundred and Fifty ThouÂ«
sand Dollars Neded to tare for
the Unfortunates.
1 Dr. George L. Fitch addressed a com
munication to the Board of Supervisors
yesterday on the subject of a Government
reservation for the lepers of the country,
asking co-operation in procuring one. Dr.
Fitch has evidently made a close study of
the matter, for he goes into details regard
ing the number of lepers in the country
and the manner in which the disease was
incurred.
In his introductory remarks Dr. Fitch
says the United States is the dumping
ground of the lepers of the world, and that
there are few States where there are no
cases. He cit<^ lowa, Minnesota, Oregon.
Dakota, Washington and New Mexico as
States where colonies of lepers have been
gathered aud isoated from their fellow
men. The fact that they are spread over
so ereat a territory, in his estimation, pre
cludes the caring for the outcasts by any
one State or community, and he advances
the idea that un-y should be amply pro
vided for by the National Government.
His idea is that they should not be im
prisoned in a pesthouse, but should be lo
cated on a large tract of land in some
isolated section, where tbey could have
plenty of free air and room and oe free
from the humiliation of being watched,
and also from the danger oi communi
cating the disease to other.-. He suggests
that a location be selected somewhere in
the foothills, the Pajaio Valley, for in
stance, where 2500 acres of land could he
purchased lor about $10 per acre, or $25,000.
The cost of the necessary buildi: gs and
implements he computes at $60,000 and the
expense for maintenance, outside of what
the unfortunates could do for themselves,
at $65,000, making a total of $150,000, which
he says would be a small sum for the
Government to expend for so great an ob
ject. He computes the number of lepers
in the State at twenty-five and the num
ber in the country at" 300.
Dr. Fitch say;, he iia- aad conversations
with Senator White.Connressmen Barham
and Mueuire, and all have promised co
operation in an attempt to induce the
Government to m:*ke the necessary
appropriation. He also says that Dr.
Carter of the State Board of Health of
lowa, while on a recent visit to this City,
discussed the matter with him, and ex
pressed a belief that the scheme was not
only feasible, but neces ary. Dr. Carter
promised to u-e his influence with the Ra
tional Legislature of his State to gain the
desired end.
Dr. Fitch requests the Board of Super
visors to communicate with the Super
visors of the various counties in the S.ate,
asking them to co-operate in the matter.
Mayor Sutro, president oof. f the Board of
Heahu, said yesterday that he was heartiy
in favor of such a movement, and that he
had always maintained that the Govern
ment wa9 ihe proper guardian of the
lepers, since the majority wen aliens who
came here to escape being connued la their
native countries.
In Memory of Jucob Z. Uavig
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children met yesterday and elect- d a comm t
tee, consisting of Colonel Sonntag, pn-ia> in

A FORTUNE GIVEN BY NODS OF THE HEAD
Andreas Cavalli Inherits
Mexican Gold
Mines.
Left to Him by a Brother Who
Was Speechless From
Paralysis.
THE DEVISEE A HUMBLE ME
CHANIC HERE.
How the Discoverer of the Great
Anaconda Mines Died in the
State of Sonora.
Gold street is the significant name of a j
little alley between JacKson and Pacific j
streets, where there lives an old inventor
whose brother recently died in Mexico,
leaving him six gold mines of great though
unknown value.
The fortunate heir to this hidden treas- j
ure is G. Andreas Cavalli, brother of L. |
Paul Cavalli, ta.uous in mining circles as !
the discoverer of the great Anaconda cop- :
per ledges of Butte City, Wont. It was >
Paul who recently died near Minas Prie- ;
tas, Mexico, and left his brother all his
estate â not by a duiy witnessed will on
parchment, nor yet Dy . word of mouth,
but by nods and winks that conveyed his
meaning to those who stood by while his
lifetide ebbed away.
'â¢Such a disposition of property would i
not be a conveyance or will under Ameri
can law," said Attorney Oscar T. Bhack,
who represents Mr. Cavalli, "but ihe Mt-x
-ican laws recognize it, and my client is j
here new with full authority as ad ruin is- ''
trator of his brother's estate, and with j
documents to 3how that he had been re
cognized as sole heir by the courts of Her
mosillo, capital of Sonora.
"He has just returned after a sojourn
there and will soon be appointed adminis
trator for his brother's estate here and in
Arizona. The dead man had important
interests in both States, and they must be
looked after. As our courts do not recog
. nize the will of tlie dead man, expressed
in nods, the brother will be compelled to
divide the American property with six
other brothers."
Sixteen years ago Paul Cavalli drifted
to Mexico, disconsolate over the loss of
the Anaconda, the value of which he did
not recognize. His brother, Andreas, did
not hear from him regularly, and had
begun to believe he was dead or had been
very unsuccessful. A few weeks ago, how
ever, word came that Paul had died on
September 21 of paralysis, and that he had
left all his mines to Andreas here. An
dreas, who has lor years spent all his in
come in pertecting some patents for mak
ing boots and shoes, hastened to Hermo-
Billo. where the news was confirmed. He
had no trouble in being declared sole heir
and being made administrator.
Speaking of tbe case yesterday, he said:
"My brother was stricken down with par
alysis in such a way that he could not
speak. Those who gathered around him,
when they saw he could not live, Knowing
he had relatives, asked him whom he de
sired to be his heir. By running over the
alphabet and agreeing on a system of
signal^ my name was spelled out and the
will of my brother was composed as a
result of his nods of the head."
One of the valuable things left to the
humble Ban Francisco mechanic is a claim
of $16,000 against the Mexican Govern
ment. It is in such form as to be as good
as gold.
Another piece of property is what law
yers call "a chose in action," being an
Indian depredation claim against the
United States. Paul Cavalli was at one
time a resident of Pima County, Arizona.
He was a partner of Charles Peck, whose
wife and children were murdered by
Geronimo'.s baud in 1890. At the same
time the property of the firm was de
stroyed, and a claim for large sums is now
pending against the United Stales Gov
ernment, with good chances that it will
be allowed.
Mr. Cavaili takes his great success very
philosophically, and, though he might
realize considerable cash for his interests,
he continues living in the way he has
been accustomed to live for years. His
home is still in Gold alley, and, though
the name has for years stared him in the
face like a jest of fate or a bit of irony, he
now has his laugh as he trudges to his
humble abode. Just opposite the alley,
on Montgomery -street, the name "Gold
street" is painted on a gas lamp in red
letters. Cavalli smiled as he read the
name by the flickering flame last night.
He says he can complete his patents now,
and if they prove non-productive the
whirligig of time can hardly deal with him
harshly anyhow, for his fortune is in the
Mexican mountains, down where his
favorite brother died.

LADES WHO ARE LABORING TO MAKE THE FAIR A SUCCESS.
FOR MEMORIAL CHURCH
South San Francisco Ladies
Have Opened a
Bazaar.
Masonic Hall Transformed Into a
Scene of Beauty and
Elegance.
The funds of Memorial Presbyterian
Church at South San Francisco will, if the
united labors of the Ladies' Aid Society
bear fruit, be increased sufficiently to
meet all current expenses for the ensuing
year.
To accomplish this desirable object
Masonic Hall on Fourteenth and Railroad
avenues has been transformed into a
series of booths artistically decorated with
the products of fancy work made by deli
cate feminine fingers.
There is on exhibition and for sale c
fine display of fancy articles, needlework,
embroidery and artificial towers, besides
a confectionery-stand and table of Vene
tian iron work. There was shown a
'â¢Hive of Busy Bees," "The House That
Jack Built" for the children, and a fountain.
An excellent lunch, with icecream, was
served from 12 m. to 11 last r.ighi.
"The House That Jack Built" was lib
erally patronized by the small boys, who
laughed heartily at JacÂ£'s appearance as
he emerged from his workshop In response
to a ring of the doorbell.
The embroidery and artificial work
which adorn the booths allotted to their
use have been tastefully got up and
reflect Rreat cr.dit on the skill of the
ladies who labored on them patiently for
months in order that the bazaar might be
a success, which it promises to be.
A number of ladies are in charge of the
various booths, and between disposing of
the anicles offered for Â«ale and entertain
ing the many visitors they are kept busy.
But as it is a work cf love and devotion
it is born cheerfully by one and all.
Mrs. H. N. Bevier, the pleasant and
cbarminj; wife of the minister of Memo

every person is made welcome. The other
helpers are: Mrs. George Kelley, Mrs. Cal

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11. 1896.
HIS CONTUMELY
COST HIM DEAR
John Overman Made to
Forfeit Property Valued
at $15,000.
Had Refused to Answer Ques
tions During the Taking oi
His Deposition.
A LONG LITIGATION ENDED.
Creditors of a Decedent Who Was
Dec ared Insolvent Now to Be
Paid in Full.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broad way, Nov. 10. j
As a penalty for contumacious conduct
in refusing to answer certain questions in
the taking of his deposition, John Over
man of Sonoma County was made to for
feit $15,000 worth of real estate by Judge
Frick yesterday.
The litigation, of which this was the
sensational outcome, extended over a pe
riod of marly ten years, and its history is
replete with peculiar incidents.
As far back as 1887 John Overman, who
resides ten miles from Petaluma. on the
road to Santa Rosa, began a suit in the
Superior Court of Alarm da County aeainst
William I. Wilson and Jessie Wiison,
the latter's wife, to quiet title to six
lots and the houses erected ihereon in
West Oakland, valued at about $15,000.
Subsequent to the filing of the suit Wil
son petitioned to be declared an insolvent,
and his request was granted. Henry C.
Babcock was appointed assignee oi the
estate of Wilson, and on behalf of tbe
creditors riled acomplaint in intervention.
In this it was allege 1 that the property
claimed by Overman had been wrongly
and illegally conveyed to Overman through
Mrs. Priscilla Burtch of Petaluma, a
former intimate friend of Wilson, for the
purpose of defrauding the creditors of
Wilson.
Wilson died in 1890 and his widow fol
lowed him shortly afierward. Meanwhile
the litigation dragged aiong, and was
finally set for trial before Judge Frick for
to-day.
The counsel of defendants B:\beock and
the legal representatives of William 1.
Wilson and Jessie Wileon deemed it nec
essary to take the dÂ«Â»: ositions of Overman
and Mrs. Burtch. For this purpose sub
penas were regularly issued and served
upon plaintiff's attorney and upon Over
man and Mrs. Burtch, setting the time
for the taking of their depositions for 10
o'clock Saturday, November 9, before John
H. Rodgers, a notary public at Petaluraa.
At the time appointed Overman and
Mrs. Burtch appeared at the ortice of the
notary, sccompanied by their attorney,
Henry Miller. The defense was repre
sented by Welles Whitmore of Oakland and
Fisher Ames of San Francisco.
An attempt was ma le to take the depo
sitions of the plaintiff Overman and the
lady who accompanied him. but under the
advice of counsel they refused to answer
questions put to them regarding the pur
chase of the property by Overman, the
manner ia which he secured possession oi
it, the relations existing between the par
ties and, in fact, nearly every question
wh eh would throw any light upon the
true nature or character of their trsnsac
tions in respect to the property covered
by the suit.
Under these circumstances counsel for
the defendants were obliged to request ihe
notary to certify the conduct of the wit
nesses and particularly of the plaintiff,
Overman, to the court.
The trial came on before Judce Frick
this morning. Neither the plain t'.ff nor
Mrs. Burtch was present in court, though
their attorney, Henry Miller, appeared for
them.
Upon offering in evidence the deed from
Priscilla Burtch to Overman, upon wh.ch
plaintiff reiird to establish his title and
prove his ca^e, defendants objected to the
introduction of any evidence on the cart
of the plaintiff, and urged as a ground for
such objection that the plaintift by refus
ing to answer material and perunent
questions had subjected himself to the
penalty of having nis complaint in the
case aÂ« well as his answer to the complaint
in intervention by Babcock stricken out.
In support of this objection the deposi
tion of Overman, wnich was attempted to
be taken in Petaluma, was read to the
court, wheieupon the court ordered the
complaint of plaintiff, together with his
auswer to the complaint of intervention
by Babcock, stricken out. This left the
case before (he court upon Babcook's com
plaint of intervention, wherein he sought
to quiet the title to the property in ques
tion against the plaintiff.
The court then proceeded to hear evi
dence on behalf of Babcock, ana prooi
was made of the title of W. I. Wilson to
the property in question by virtue of a
deed made to him in 1879 by Prentice
Croweil and l-y the oral testimony of W.
Y. C. Pitt and Maggie Cox.
Upon this showing the court ordered a
decree in lavor of Babcock as assignee of
W. I. Wilson, quieting title to the prop
erty in dispute as against Overman and all
others to the litigation.
It is believed that the proceeds from
the sale of this property will pay all the
debts of the deceased Wilson in full.
SWALLOWED MORPHINE.
William Gade, a Waiter, Dying at the
deceiving Hospital.
William Gade, a waiter, living at 217
Eddy street, swallowed a dose of mor
phine yesterday afternoon abont 5 o'clock.
Drs. Gross and Clarke were summoned,
and after working on him for several hours
they summoned the ambulance and he
was taken to the Receiving Ho>pital. Dr.
Stice. after an examination, expressed the
opinion that Gade was beyond recovery.
He is 22 years of age and has been out of
employment for two or three months,
which made him very despondent. His
frienls say that he was in the habit of
taking morphine, but they believe he
swallowed an overdose with suicidal in
tent owing to his inability to get-wort.

Balore the strange wheelbarrow proces
sion had gone far clans of spectators gath
ered ana welcomed the wagemafcers with
a shower of eggs: but they went Lravely
to the end of their journey, though the
men and the barrow were yellow with eggs
when they had reached :he ferries.
Bronson finally cried aloud, "Ob, Hanna
hasn't done a thing to me!" The men
had a hand-organ alone and made merry
at every corner, attracting a great
crowd.

BOWED TO THE
DREAD BERIBERI
A Case of the Terrible
Oriental Disease in
This City.
G. Ishawaka, a Young Japanese
Farmer, the Un:ortunate
Victim.
SUFFERED SIVERAL YEARS,
A Sickness That Makes Men Lik
Animals and lor Which No Care
Has Been Found.
For the first time in many years a case
of that terrible disease called beriberi, the
terror of the inhabitants of India, Japan
and Ceylon, to which countries it is
mainly confined, has made its appearance
in San Francisco, and, as is invariably the
case, the victim has succumbed.
The victim was G. Ishiwaka, a Japanese
farmer, 23 years of ag' , who died on Mon
day at the Japanese lodging-house at 270
Brannan street after a lingering illness of
at least three years.
Beriberi is more dreaded by Orientals
than even leprosy, the "living death," and
in the countries where it is prevalent is
generally designated as "the slow death."
Beriberi is a Singalese word that means
"the greatest weakness."
The victims are generally young men or
men in the prime of life, and though emi
nent physicians have searched long and
earnestly for the origin and a cure, it has
baffled all their efforts, and is ranked to
day among the hopeless diseases. The
first symptc ms are not alarming, being
merely a muscular weakness, to which
usuaUy little heed is paid. Gradually the
disease spreads from muscle to muscle
until the entire trunk is within its grasp
and then tbe brain is attacked.
Sensory weakness, so gradual that the
victim does not at first notice it, ensues
and slow degeneration progresses to the
end.
Anemia, paralysis and widespread in
flammation of the nerves are among the
last symptom* of the disease, but the>e do
not generally make their appearance until
the patient has faced "the slow Ueath" for
years. The Japanese well know the hope
lessness of trying for a cure, but With the
sto.cism of their race plod on until sheer
weakness compels them to lie down and
wait for the day when death conies to
their relief.
Shortly after the disease attacks the
brain it is not infrequently the ca.-e that
the victims imitate the aciionsof sheep
and other animals. They go on all fours
from inability to stand erect, and as the
nerve ceniers become more and more
affected the animal characteristics become
more and more marked until they are a
constant care to those who harbor them.
One of the most terribie characteristics
of the disease is the constant conscious
ness el slowly approaching death. Hope
less and despairing the unfortunate drags
out a weary existence until tue vita! spark
flickers out and relief comes.
As far as the records of the Health De
partment show this is the first case in San
Francisco in three years and the fourth in
tiie last twenty years.
When Ishiwaka first arrived in this City
from Japan, two years ago, his symptoms
were not fully developed ami he worked
at iarming for some time. Gradually, how
ever, he grew weaker and finally became a
charge on his countrymen, who cared for
him until his death.
Dr. M. Tsumagi, the Japanese physician
who was called to attend him, tried every
available remedy to stay the march of the
disease, but witnout avail, and the patient
constantly reminded Dim that it was use
less aud that he must die.
PETERS' SIDEWALK.
Gray Brog. Want to Supplant Pine
Boards With Art Stone.
Judge Beawell yesterday granted an in
junction io restrain George F. Gray and
Harry N. Gray from tearing up a wooden
sidewalk in front of the premises of Wil
liam Peters, on Sheridan street, near
Tenth. Peters sets forth in his complair.t
that he laid a good sidewalk of Oregon
pine lumber on the 28th of last April, in
accordance with an order from the Super
intendent of fetreets; that the premises
are not within the limits where stone or
art tici.'i! stone walks are required by law;
that subsequently the Superintendent of
Streets made a contract with Gray Bros,
to put down an artificial stone walk, and
that they threaten to destroy his wooden
walk; that they are insolvent and unable
to respond in damages for injury to the
plaintiff's property if they be allowed
to proceed. Peters also demands $500
damages and costs of suit. .
