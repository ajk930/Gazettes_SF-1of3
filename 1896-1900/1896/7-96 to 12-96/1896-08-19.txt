MADISON-SQUARE GARDEN, NEW
YORK, N. V., Aug. 18.â The mass-meet
ing of tie Democratic Honest Money
League was held this evening under the i
most favorable auspices. The weather j
was ail that couid be desired â clear and |
delightfully cool â ami thousands upon j
thousands of persons turned out to hear
Hon. W. Bourke Cockrau's reply to Uie j
speech of William Jennings Bryan, de
livered in the same amphitheater last ]
Wednesday night.
The arrangements for ths meeting were j
on a most elaborate and almost perfect I
"cfile and the trouble and tumult outside
the garden, which marked the Bryan
demonstration, were entirely lacking. The
police arrangements were practically the
Bime as on the occasion of the Bryan
meeting. Acting Chief Courtright was j
the commanding officer of the police force,
and was early on band with fully 500 uni
formed men. It was not found necessary !
to block the streets surrounding the gar- ;
den, as on the former occasion, and when
the doors were thrown open the crowd as
sembled gradually and without any per- ]
ceptible contusion. The Sixty-ninth Regi- i
ment band rendered a number of National !
airs, while the audience filed in.
Every man, woman and child who en
tered was given a small American flag and
a leaflet containing the words of the
"Star- spangled Banner" and "America."
These songs were rendered by a double
quartet, in which the vast assemblage as- :
sisted. The small American flags played ;
a prominent part later in the evening, j
when they were waved vigorously and â 
with charming effect by the vast audience
when it gave vent to its enthusiasm at
some of the many points made by Mr.
Cockran in the course of his speech. The
decorations in the great hall were far more
profuse than those of the Bryan meeting.
The platform, which was considerably
larger than that used last week, was taste
fully dressed in the National colors. On
it, besides Major John Byrnes, president
of the Democratic Honest Money League,
who called the meeting to order; Hon.
Perry Beimont, the permanent chairman
of the meeting, and Hon. W. Bourke
Cockran, the speaker of the evening, there
were a host of prominent Democrats of
National and local renown and a large
number of the vice-presidents of the meet
ing.
Included in the latter were the follow
ing: John T. Agnew, S. Butler, Boston;
W. Bayard Cutting, John K. Cowan, Bal
timore; Charles A. Conant, Boston; Paul
Dana, Charles A. Dana, Charles S. Fair
child, George Gray, Wilmington, Del.;
John C. Buliitt. Philadelphia; Roawell P.
Flower, E. L. Godkin, Eldridge T. Gerry,
Abram S. Hewitt, Horatio C. King, St.
Clair McKelway, Charles E. Miller, Wil
liam B. Hornblower; John A. McCall,
A. K. McClure, Philadelphia; Herman
Oelrichas, Oswald Ottendorfer, J. Edward
Simons, William M. Singerley, Philadel
phia; J. H. Outhwaite, Ohio; Wheeler
Peckham, Carl Schurz, J. Kennedy Tod,
Spencer Trask, John DeWitt Warner,
William C. Whitney, John D. Benton,
North Dakota, and a number of others.
At 7:45 the garden rapidly filled. As
persons prominent in political and busi
ness life came in and were recognized by
the assemblage the spectators manifested
their enthusiasm with cheers and other
forms of applause.
Eighty-three hundred chairs had been
placed in the arena of the great audi- j
torium. This arrangement swelled the ;
seating capacity of the building to about I
18,000. At 8:25, when Mr. Cockran camel
in, every seat was occupied. With Mr.
Cockran were: General Lloyd Brice, Hon.
Perry Beimont, ex-Mayor Cooper, Horace
White, John C. Tomlinson, John Mack Jr.,
Mrs. Cooper Hewitt, Mrs. Creary and Mrs.
Brice. The party was escorted by Major
Byrne. Mr. Cockran was received with
prolonged cheers. Major Byrne imme
diately advanced to the front of the plat
form, and when at 8:30 order was re
stored he called the meeting to order in
a brief speech. He was heartily ap- '
plauded throughout. When he named j
Hon. Perry Beimont as chairman the i
cheering was renewed.
Mr. Beimont advanced slowly to the i
front of the platform, and when the ap- J
plause which greeted him ceased, he began j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
his speech in a slow and deliberate man
ner. Mr. Beimont said :
"This is a time for very plain speaking.
We want no victory under a false flag.
The Democratic standard was supplanted
at Chicago by the rag of the Populists,
which we firmly refuse to follow to the
disgrace of the Nation. We are Democrats
and we represent Democrats who intend
to remain Democrats, refusing ever to sur
render the honored name of our party to
the Populists. The fusion of 16 to 1 inde
pendent free silver men, Populists and so
called Bryan Democrats is complete. Some
of their leaders attempt to disguise the
fusion, but they dare not dispute its ex
istence, for they depend on votes of the
fusionists. The opening of the mints to
the independent, unlimited coinage of fiat
silver dollars is but an intermediate stage ;
the employment of the Government print
ing presses for the issue of fiat money is
the ultimate aim of the fusion party."
Continuing, Mr. Beimont said:
"At the conference at Washington of the
fiat silver organization last January the
Populist claim was recognized, and if free
coinage should not yield enough of fiat
silver then greenbacks would be issued.
The fiat silver party thereby abandoned
the hard-money contention put forth by
Exact size and shape of a piece of gold ore in the possession of Charles Peach* It is about three inches thick
and it is estimated that it contains about $240 Worth or Precious Metal.
Mr. Bland years ago that the quantity of
gold and silver coined under free coinage
should be the teat of the volume of Gov
ernment currency and that Cougress
should have no other control over the
issue of full, legal-tender money. That
was the real reason Mr. Bryan was pre
ferred over Mr. Bland at the contention.
Mr. Bland was not enough of a Populist.
The candidate chosen has been and is a
Populist. He himself announced that he
is not a Democrat."
Mr. Beimont trusted that the Demo
cratic party in the State of New York in
this crisis woulu hold faithfu'ly to the
attitude it a-sumed at the Chicago con
vention. It would be monstrous, he said,
to suppose anything else. That attitude
was oue of uncompromising opposition to
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, AUGUST 19,* 1896.
A voice, interrupting â How are you for the working classes ?
Mr* Bryan â You take what I have said and what I have done and let the
thinking people decide* â From the press report of Bryan's speech at Poughkeepsie,

to what delegates announced as an attacic :
upon social order. But even if every Slate !
convention in the Union, including New
York, should declare lor the Chicago can- i
didate. they would lose their Democratic
character.
The issue, stripped of all verbiage and
sophistry, of all sectionalism and preju- |
dice, is now as it was before the nomina
tion of Mr. Bryan, one of morals, one of
honesty. He would not question the mp
tives of any one, nor say that ali the sup
porters of this extraordinary movement i
were intentionally dishonest.
"But to speak plainly," said he, "I do say
that behind them are unscrupulous men !
and a crude and flimsy free silver litera-

frure, clearly dishonest in purpose, for they
lead directly to repudiation, to fiat money,
the degradation of the Supreme (pourt by
political control, an unconstitutional im
pairment of the obligations and interfer
ence with the freedom of contracts, a reck
less attack upon our National and mone
tary integrity, as well as upon our whole
system of commercial credit."
At one point in his speech, where he
was particularly severe on Populistc and
Populism, in which category he included
Mr. Bryan, a number of hisses were heard,
but these were quickly drowned out by
the counter cheers of the majority of the
auditors.
Mr. Beimont concluded hia remarks at
8:45 and then introduced the speaker of
the evening, Hon. W. Bourke Gockran.
A QUESTION NOT ANSWERED.
The vast auditorium was linmediaiaiy in
an uproar and thÂ« ovation of the nigUt
was tendered the ex-Congressman. Men
and women stood in their places and
cheered themselves hoarse, at the same
time waving small American flags vigor
ously. When the cheering had subsided
in a measure the New York Glee Club be
gan to sing the "Star-Spangled Banner."
The audience joined in and helped oat
the chorus.
Mr. Cockran at length secured order and
plunged at once into bis subjectâ his reply
to Mr, Bryan's speech. Mr. Cockran said:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, fellow-
Democrats: With the inspiring strains of that
National song still ringing in our ears wno
I can doubt the issue of this campaign? [Ap
planse.] That issue has been well stated by
j your presiding; officer. Stripped, as he says, of
all verbal disguise, it is an issue of common
honesty [applause], an issue between the hon
est discharge and the dishonest repudiation
of public and private obligations
It is a question as to whethar the powers of
this Government shall be used to protect hon
est industry or to tempt the citizens to dishon
esty. On this question honest men cannot
differ. [Applause.] It is one of moral* and of
justice. It involves the existence of social
order. It i? the contest for civilization Itself.
If it be disheartening to Democrat* and the
I lovers of free institutions to find an issue of
this character projected into a Presidential
campaign this meeting furnishes us witn an
inspiring truth of how that issue will be met
by the people. [Applause.] A Democratic
convention may renounce the Democratic
faith, bat the Democracy remains faithful to
Democratic principles. [Applnuse.] Demo
cratic leaden may betray a convention to the
Populists, but they cannot seduce the foot
steps of Democratic voters from the pathway
of honor and of justice. [Applause.] A candi
aate bearing the mandate of a Democratic con
vention may in this hall open a canvass
leveled against the foundations of social order
and he beholds the Democratic masses con
fronting him on the ground of defense. [Ap
plause]
Fellow-Democrats, let us not disguise from
ourselves the fact that we bear in this contest
a serious and grave and solemn burden of
duty. We must raise our hands against the
nominee of our party, and we must do it to
preserve the future of that party itself. [Ap
plause.] We must oppose the nominee of the
Cnicago convention, and we know full well
that the success of our opposition will mean
our own exclusion from public life, but we
will be consoled and gratified by the reflection
tbat it will prove that the American people
cannot be divided into parties on a question of
simple morals or of common honesty. [Ap
plause-] We would look In vain through the
speach delivered here one week ago to find a
true statement of the issue involved in this
canvass. [Laughter.] Indeed, I believe it is
doubtful if the candidate himself q-iite under
stands the nature of the faith which he pro
fesses. [Laughter.] I say this not In criticism
of his ability, but in justice to his morality.
[Laughter.] I believe that if he himself under
stood the inevitable consequences of the doc
trines which he preaches that his hands would
be the very first to tear down the platform on
which he stands. [Applause.]
But there was one statement in that speech
which was very far from ambiguity, pregnant
witn hope and confidence to the lovers oi
order. He professes his unquestioned belief
in the honesty of the American masses and he
quoted Abraham Lincoln in support of the
faith that was in him. Well, I don't believe
that the faith of Abraham Lincoln was ever
more significantly justified than in the appear
ance which Mr. Bryan presented upon this
platform in the changes that have come over
the spirit and the tone of PopuliÃtic eloquence
since the Chicago convention. We all must
remember that lurid rhetoric which glowed as
fiercely in the Western skies as that sunlight
which through the past week foretold tha tor
rid heat of the ensuing day, and here upon
this platform we find that some rhetoric as
mild, as insipid as the waters of a stagnant
pool. He is a candidate who was swept into
the nomination by a ware of popular enthu
siasm, awakened by appeals to prejudice and
greed. He is a candidate who, on bis trip
home and in the initial steps of his trip east
ward, declared that this was a revolutionary
movement; who no sooner found himself face
to face with the American feeling than he re
alized that this soil is not propitious to revo
lution.
The people of this country will not change
the institutions which have stood the tests and
experiences of a century* for institutions based
upon the fantastic dreams of Populist agita
tors. The American Nation will never con
sent to a substitute for the Republic of
Washington, of Jefferfon and of Jackson for
the republic of an Altgeld, a Tiliman or a
Bryan. [Applause.] Now, my friends, I have
eeid there was one statement of great signifi
cance in Mr. Bryan's speech. There is another
portion of it which is singulagly free from any
obscurity, and that may be comprised within
the two initial paragraphs where he talks logi
cally, consistently, plainly, the language of
revolution. Whatever change may have come
over his manner as a candidate, however much
the vehemence of his eloquence may have
been reduced, two things for which he stands
remain unaltered. On this platform he de
fends the most revolutionaay plank oi the Chi
cago convention in speech less vehement but
not lesft earnest than that in which he sup
ported their adoption. On this platform he
defended the Populistic progarame of over
throwing the integrity of the Supreme Court.
[Applause.]
If there be any truit which has grown, for the
benefit of all mankind out of the establish
ment of our Republic it has been the demon
stration that it is possible by the organization
of an Independent tribunal to safeguard the
rights of every cittzen and protect those nat
ural privileges against any invasion from
whatever source or however powerful might
be the antagonizing elements. [Applause.]
The very existence oi that power presupposes
Â» the existence of an independent tribunal-
Yet we have this Populist convention, because
a Populist meiuiure was condemned as uncon
stitutional, proposing not to amend the con
stitution in toe ordinary way prescribed by
that instrument itself, but proposing to pack
the court, to reorganize it (he used the lan
â  gaage of the platform itself), so that it will
j pronounce chose laws to be constitutional
j which the constitution iisejf condemnsâ a pro
-1 poaal to make the courts of law instruments of
( lawlessness; to violate that sacred pact be
tween tfce States, on which the security of
this Nation rests; to profane the temple
erected for its protection by (he hauds of false
I priests, who, though sworn to defend it, will
! be appointed to destroy it. [Great applause.]
In the time to which I must confine myself
i to-night I enn do nothing but examine that
| one question which Bryan himself declares to
H. Helfrich, the Man "Who Discovered the Most Valuable Gold Ore
Ever Found in California.

be the overshadowing issue of this campaign.
I am a little puzzled when I read this speech I
to decide just what Mr. Bryan imagines will be j
the fruit of a change in the standard of value ]
throughout this country. I do not believe
that any man can follow wholly with the
speech, because if be dissents from one set of
conclusions he has got to rea.d but a few para
graphs and he will find another of a different
1 variety. But I assume that it is fair in a dis-
I cussion of this character, independently of
I what Mr. Bryan may say or what Mr. Bryan
! may think himself he stands for, to examine
the inevitable economic effects of a debase
ment of the coinage by a change in the stand
ard by which existing debts are to be meas
ured la a baser measure of value. Now I will
imagine tbat Mr. Bryan himself may believe
that In some way or other he is going to benefit
the toilers of the country. He says he is, but
ihe declines to show us how. [Laughter and
1 applause.]
For my part I am willing to state here that
Lif Mr. Bryan oould show me that by any means ,
known to heaven or known to earth, any means
revealed to the comprehension of man,
wages could be increased, I will be ready to ;

All the Shareholders Are Poor People,
but They Will Become
Capitalists.
The one hundred happiest people in San
Francisco to-day are the one hundred
shareholders of the Marguerite mine tbat
is located almost within the city limits of
Auburn, Placer County. They are all com
paratively poor people, and yet they are
carrying around little pieces of "rock"
tbat ranges in value from $10 to $240.
The reason they are doing this is be
cause the greatest gold discovery of mod
ern times was made in tbeir mine last Fri
day morning. So great is the amount of
gold discovered tbat it sounds almost fabu
lous, and were the men who made the find
less reliable and trustworthy citizens their
statements would hardly be believed. But
as well as having the best of reputations,
the men who make the statements also
show some of the finest gold ore ever
taken from the ground.
Like most big gold discoveries the one in
the Marguerite mine was made almost by
accident. The Marguerite mine is really
a part of the Old Salzac that was worked
so profitably in 1860. At the time it
yielded vast amounts of the yellow metal,
but suddenly "petered," and the pro
moters pulled out for Virginia City, little
thinking that within five feet of their
shaft there was a fortune concealed in the
rocks.
The Old Salzac mine lay abandoned and
half full of water until two years ago,
when the Marguerite Company, at the sug
gestion of Professor Dee trick, bought it.
He had discovered four outcroppings lying
a few hundred feet to the north, and con
cluded tbat if a shaft was sunk about 300
feet and then tunneled so as to meet the
Old Salzac, the tunnel would pass through
the four ledges so that they could be
worked by "sloping." The idea in making
the connection with the Old Salzac was to
provide ventilation.
The shaft and tunnel were sunk as
directed and the tour ledges were found in
tueir proper places. All yielded a good
assay, so that the miners knew they had a
fine piece of property. But what was their
surprise to find the tunnel suddenly strike
a fifth ledge for which there was ,no out*
cropping. Assays of this ledge showed not
less than $300 a ton.
It was then that the miners concluded
to look for the top of the ledge. It was
manifest that it was between the opening
of the Â«haft of th â  Old Salzac and the last
lede;e discovered in the tunnel. Over forty

square feet of surface was turned over be
fore any trace of it was found. Last
Thursday morning at a depth of sixteen
feet and within live feet of the shaft of the
Old Salzac the same valuable ore that was
found in the tunnel was dug out.
Word was sent to the directors in this
City to come out at once and see the won
derful find, as it was then apparent that
the rich ore reached tnrough at least 300
feet of the earth's crust. But a greater
surprise was in store.
H. Helfrich was delegated to go to the
mine. He saw the end of the uncovered
ledge, and then, aa much for exercise as
anything else, swung his pick into the
ground a few feet away. He struck against
quartz. He persevered ana soon rolled
out some fine rock. More picking
and he found a piece as big
aa his head. He tried to break it,
but somehow it bung together, and inves
tigation showed that the tenacity was
caused by wire gold that went through
the rock in all directions. It was "alive
with gold," as the miners say.
An ays of this ore showed the marvelous
amount of $78,000 a tou, probably the
highest grade gold ore ever found. Sev
eral tons of it were extracted, and the
poorest selected pieces showed over $400 a
ton. The average of the pile showed over
|5000 a ton.
As both ends of the ledge hare been
found and both yield ore of the highest
grade, the chances are that the samo kind
extends from one end to the other. At
last report tha top of the ledge was found
to be two and a half feet wide, and the
chances are it is wider. As it has been ex
tended and deepened the high grade ore
has prevailed.
The directors of the Marguerite mine
are George Schafer, F. M. Freund, H. Hel
frich, H. Gimball and Charles Peach, all
of this City.
In conversation with a Call reporter,
Mr. Peach, the secretary of the company,
said: "We are all highly delighted with
our discovery, of course, and don't want
to overestimate it- But we have been in
tne mining business for some time and
think that we have made the greatest sold
discovery of modern times in tne Mar
guerite.
"We have surely found the highest
grade ore ever taken from the ground and
there is every indication that it is the
largest vein of that value in existence.
Even at the low estimate of $5000, tbe 300
feet should yield about $15,000,000. We
feel sure that there is that much ore in
sight, and if the real high grade should
prevail the amount can hardly be calcu
lated. We are all rich."
Since the big discovery the end of the
ledge has been fenced in and men placed
on guard day and night. The little bit
that has been taten out will aggregate
about $50,000, and the ore is so fine a man
could almost carry a fortune in his pocket.
AMERICAN ARMENIANS.
Naturalized Citizens of the
United States Imprisoned
in Turkey.
Minister Terriil Demands That They
Bj Turned Over to Him for
Examination.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 18.-A Herald
special from Washington says: The De
partment of State has been informed that
immediately upon learning of the impris
onment of nine Americansin Turkey Min
ister Terriil dispatched a note to the
Turkish Minister demanding that they be
turned over to him for trial if they were
charged with a criminal offense, or that
they be freed and allowed to leave the
city if not guilty of any crime.
The prisoners are naturalized, being Ar
menians by birth and having returned to
their country, they claim, to visit rela
tives. Six of the men have passports is
sued by the State Department, two have
papers clearly snowing their American
citizenship, and the ninth, although claim
ing to be an American, is unable to fully
establish the fact to the satisfaction of the
Minister and the Turkish authorities.
It is the expectation of the Minister that
a reply will be immediately forthcoming,
and as there are many precedents for the
demand he has made the authorities be
lieve that the Turkish Government will
comply. Minister Terriil has the right to
try all Americans arrested for crime com
mitted in Turkey.
Minister Terriil has been in Turkey only
two weeks. He has looked into the Knapp
case and expects to set a date for its trial
as soon as he disposes of the accumulated
business now before him.

BOSTON, Mass., Aug. 18.â Brooklyn won to
day in the rain before a small crowd. The
game was stopped in the third inning, when
the Bostons had two men on bases and o*ne
out, and was resumed after a delay of twenty
five minutes. It rained quite hard In the last
part of the fifth and the Bostons adopted de
laying tactics, which incensed Sheridan so
much that he compelled them to play though
the water came down fast. The inning com
pleted, he called the game. Attendance 1119.

Successful Vpeninn, Alt the Races Being
Completed m Good Time.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 18.â The first day
of Astoria's third anr.ual regatta opened
somewhat inauspiciously, the sky being
overcast and there being but little wind.
Early in the afternoon, however, a brisk
breeze sprang up and all the sailing racss
were completed in good time. Tne almost
total absence of wind in the morning

Stevens men over a three-mile course in
19:25.

was won by the Mayflower of Ilwaco,
which defeated her four competitors after
a most interesting contest.

seven starters and was won by the Claude
B. Manthorn.
In the race for ships' boats the crew of
the British ship Sutherlandshire carried
off the honors, the Antopie's crew taking
second money.
Taylor and Wroton of Astoria defeated
Clarke and Adams of the Fort Canby crew
in a double-scull Whitehall race, two sec
onds only separating the boats at the iin

SOUND MONEY AND PROTECTION
An Outline of the Policy of the Cam
paign by the Great Ohio
Statesman.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 18.â The i'Ouver
ture Rifles, a handsomely uniformed, well
drilled military company, composed of
colored men, came on a special train from
Cleveland, with a large number of their
friends, to call on Major McKinley this
afternoon. They marched behind their
own band from the station to the McKin
ley residence, and were freely cheered by
the spectators on the sidewalks and com
plimented on tbeir handsome appearance.
H. C. Smith, a colored member of the
Ohio Legislature, addressed Major McKin
ley in behall of the visitors, and presented
him with a certificate of honorary mem
bership in the rifles, the first one ever is
sued. Mr. Smith is a speaker of force and
eloquence, and his pertinent, vigorous re
marks called from Major McKinley a spir
ited response, which was momentarily
punctuated with lusty cheers and long
continued applause.
Major McKinley was in excellent form.
Replying to Mr. Smith and acknowledging
the compliment of honorary membership
in the l'Ouverture Rifles, be said:
Mr. Smith and my fellow-citizens: It gives
me great pleasure to meet and greet this com
pany of rifles and my colored fellow-citizens
of the city of Cleveland and of Northern Ohio;
and I rejoice to learn from your eloquent
spokesman that your race this year as in all
the years of the past stands faithfully to the
Republican party, which I believe is the cause
of our country. [Applause.] Ido not forget
no man can forgetâ that whether in war or in
peace the race which you represent never
turned its back on the glorious old stars^ and
stripes. [Great applause and cries of "Hurrah
for McKinley."] When that great civil war
commenced no man could say what its out
come would be in regard to its effect upon
your race. There were those who believed
that it must result in the abolition of human
slavery ; there were those who believed other
wise.
The result was the immortal proclamation
of emancipation by the best friend you ever
had, Abraham Lincoln [tremendous cheer
ing], whose name you will cherish and revere
forever and forevermore. James G. Blame
once said that the first instinctof an American
was equalityâ equality of right, equality of
privilege, equality of political power. That
sentiment long ago found expression in the
constitution of the United States, and the
principle placed In that great instrument,
where it had never been before, and where,
under God, it shall ever remain, civil and po
litical equality to every citizen everywhere
beneath the flag. [Applause.] I congratulate
you, gentlemen, upon the splendid progress
that your race has made since emancipation.
You have done better, you have advanced
more rapidly than it was believed possible at
the time; you have improved greatly the edu
cational advantages which you have had.
Your people everywhere, North and South, are
accumulating property, and to-day you stand
as among the most conservative ot the citi
zens ol this great Renublic. [Applause.] I
congratulate you from the bottom of my heart
on the advancement you have already maae,
and I sincerely wish for you and your race,
fellow-citizens of a common country, the high
est realization of your hopes and of your
prayers. [Great applause-]
We are now engaged in a political contest,
and your presence in such vast numbers here
to-day evidences the interest which you have
in the public questions that are now engaging
the attention of the American people. We
have a great country and we must keep it
great. The post which the United States must
occupy, both iv wages and industries and in
the integrity of its finances and currency,
must be at the head of ths nations of the earth.
[Great applause.] To that place of honor the
people of the country must restore it. They
have the opportunity that they have wished
for since 1892 ; will they meet it in this year
1896? [Cries of "They will."]
We want in the United States neither cheap
money nor cheap labor. [Great cheering.] We
will have neither the one nor the other. [Ap
plause.] We must not forget that nothing is
cheap to the American people which comes
from abroad when it entails idleness upon our
own laborers. [Tremendous applause.] We
are opposed to any policy which increases the
number of unemployed in the United States,
even if it does give us cheaper foreign goods,
and we are opposed to any policy which de
grades American manhood that we may have
cheaper products made either at home or
abroad. [Great applause.] Having reduced
the pay of labor, it is now proposed to reduce
the value of the money in which laDor is paid.
[Laughter]
This money question presents itself to me in
this homely ieshion: If free coinage of silver
means a 53-cent dollar then it was not an
honest dollar. [Applause.] If free coinage
means a 100-cent dollar equal to a gold dollar,
as some of its advocate* assert, we will not
then have cheap dollars, but dollars junt like
those we now have and which will be as hard
to get [applause], in which case free coinage
will not help the debtor or make it easier for
him to pay his debts. My countrymen, the
most un-American of all appeals observable in
this campaign is the one which seeks to array
labor against capital; employer against em
ploye.. It is most unpatriotic and is fraught
with the greatest peril to all concerned. We
are political equals hereâ equal in privilege
and opportunity, dependent upon each other,
and the prosperity of the one is the prosperity
ot the other. [Great cheering.] It is as Mr.
Lincoln said to the committee from the Worit
ingmen's Association from New York in the
campaign of 1864: "Property is the fruit of
labor. Property is desirable; is a positive
good in the world. That some should be rich
shows that others may become rich, and hence
is just encouragement to industry and enter
prise. Let no man who is homeless pull down
the house of another, but let him work dili
gently and build one for himself, thus by ex
ample assuring that his own shall be safe from
violence when buiit."
I thank you. my fellow-citizens, for this call
of greetings and congratulations. I thenk you
for tne honor you have conferred on me in
electing me the first honorary member of your
organization. I assure you it will give me
pleasure to meet each one of you personally
[Great applause.]
General and Mrs. Stewart L. Woodford
of New York, who have been here since
last evening, left this afternoon for the
East. Major McKinley drove them to the
station. General Woodford says the most
effective campaign literature the people
are getting this year are the speeches
which Major McKinley makes to Ue dele
gaiions which come to see him at bis
home in Canton.
Major McKinley received a number of
invitations to speak tbis morning in vari
ous parts of the country. To all of them
he made answer that he had no present
intention of going on the stump.
BRYA N DENIER ALL CHARGES.
Declares Xhat Be Is Xot on the Payroll
of Mine- Owners.
UPPER RED HOOK, N. V., Aug. 18.â
On his return from a fishinz trip to-night
Hon. William J. Bryan gave out a pre
pared answer to the allegations made by
Senator John M. Thurston that Mr. Bryan
was in the pay of the mine-owners.
He denied the allegations without quali
fication, and practically invited the Re
publican National Committee to make tbe
charge officially in order that he might be
given a chance to show exactly what his
income has been and from what sources it
was derived. Mr. Bryan's statement fol
lows:
"I have already denied this charge on
several occasions, but the reiteration of it
by Senator Thurston, a distinguished
resident of my own State, justifies me in
answering it again. I have never at any
time or under any circumstances been in
the employ of any mine-owners, in
dividually or collectively, directly or in
directly, nor have I ever been in the em
ploy or been paid by any bimetallic
organization.
"Aside from my editorial salary of
about $150 per mouth paid by the World-
Herald and a small amount derived from
the legal profession, my income since my
retirement from Congress has been de
rived from lectures before Chautauquas,
iyceums and lecture bureaus, which nave
usually paid me a fixed sum, and from
contributions made by tne people of the
localities where I have spoken.
"In some instances I have received
nothing at all. In most places I have re
ceived more than enough to cover travel
ing expenses. In only two Instances, I
think, has my compensation exceeded
$100, and in these instances it was about
$.'OO at one place and about $300 at the
other. The first platform upon which I
ran for Congress in 1890, before I
was known politically outside of my
State, contained a free-coinage plank, and
my Republican opponent that year was \
an advocate of free coinage. In the cam
paign of 1892 I again ran upon a free
coinage platform, and my opponent for
the Senate, Mr. Thurston, while opposing
unlimited coinage at 16 to 1, insisted
that ne favored bimetallism. I wrote the
free-coinage plank upon which I ran in
1890 and the free-coinage planks in the I
Nebraska State platforms in 1891, 1894, |
1895 and 1896, and tried to secure the
adoption of free-coinage planks iv the
State platforms of 1892 and 1893.
"I only mention this to show that my
advocacy of free silver is not of recent
date. Having made this answer to Mr.
Thurston's letter, I shall hereafter tafce
no notice of individual or newspaper com
ments upon this subject. If the Republican
National Committee will say officially j
that it believes I have ever been employed \
to deliver speeches by any mine-owner or i
group of mine-owners, or Dy any associa
tion supported by mine-owners, 1 am
ready to make a statement showing in de
tail all money received by me for speech
making."
Mr. Bryan will set to work composing
bis letter of acceptance without delay and
will probably largely perfect his plans for !
the campaign while here.
Last night be wired the president of the
League of Pennsylvania Democratic Clubs
that he would appear at the convention oi
that organization on August 26, instead of
the date previously announced.
An invitation from Toledo has also
been received, and he will probably speak
there on his way home. Mr. Bryan and a j
party to-day went to Spring Lake, near
Upper Red riook, on a fishing excursion.
But Mr. Bryan had no good fortune; he
caught not a fish, while Mrs. Bryan
hooked two big pickerel.
BRYAN SCORED
By COCKRAN
f Continued from I\rtt Page, i
support him here and now. [Great applause
and cheers.] I do not make this statement
through any pretense of special affection lor
the man who works with hands. Such a pre
tense made In the heat of a Presidential can- ]
vass would merely insult and discredit the in- I
tellisence to which it is addressed. [Applause,] J
I repeat that I would support any measure cal
culated to increase the rate of wages, because
I know of no test of prosperity absolutely in
fallible except the rate of wages paid to labor
ers. [Aoplause.] Where the rate of wages is
high there must be prosperity. Wheie the
rate of wages is low there must be distress.
If then Mr. Bryan can show me that by the
enforcement of any portion of his programme {
wages will be increased in this country I will I
not only support him Dut I will recognize him
as the wisest orator that ever opened his
mouth on a platform since the beginning of
the world. [Laughter.] I will be ready to con
fess that the rhetoric which I do not under
stand is really the language of inspiration.
[Laughter.] I would regard his administra
tion of the Presidency as the kindliug of a
great light before the footsteps of mau, show
ing him a broad pathway to endless happi
ness and measureless prosperity. But in
searching through his speech, in reading
through whole reams of Populistic literature
with which this country has been flooded for
four years, I have never yet found one syllable
which showed me how a Populist expected to
increase the rate of wages. [Laughter and
applause.]
When we come to find oot jnst how Mr.
Bryan expects to increase the wages of labor
we find ourselves lost in a maze of contradic
tion and In a haze of obscure expressions. No
man can tell how or when the wages of the
workingmen are to be increased, but any one
who examines the scheme can see that the in
evitable tendency, the inevitable consequences
of a debasement in the standard of value must
be a reduction in the rate of wages, and that is
the conspiracy in which the Populist is en
gaged. [Applause.]
Mr. Bryan tells us that he wants to cheapen
the dollar, that he wants to increase the
volume of money. Nothing is more common
in Populist oratory than the statement that
the volume of money must be increased for
the benefit of the peopleâ which means that
part of the people that runs and manages and
addresses Populist meetings. [Laughter and
applause.] Nothing is more common than the
statemen t that money and property are identi
cal. They are not A redundancy of money
does not prove any prosperity. There may be
a very large volume of circulating medium
ana very great poverty. The issue of paper
money simply is no more an increase of wealth
than the issue by an individual of bis promis
sory note would show an increase of his prop
erty. [Applause.] As a matter of fact, an in
crease in the coinage is no proof of an increase
in property, but may be a strong proof of a de
crease in wealth.
Let us take, tor instance, this watch case.
That is worth Its bullion value, plus the labor
that has been expended on it. If now I melt
that down into a $10 gold piece it is worth
nothing but the bullion value. Here, then,
has been an Increase In the quantity of money,
but a decrease In the volume of National
wealth. I could not buy a watch case with the j
coin, which would be coined out of this un
less X added something to it; and the pretense I
that men can be enriched by swelling the vol
ume of currency Is the oldest delusion wbien
has affected mankind since the very beginning
of civilization. [Applause.]
Continuing these illustrations at some
length Mr. Cockran naid:
Money never can circulate freely and
actively unless there be absolute confidence
in its value. [Applause.] If a man doubts
whether the money in his pocket will be as
valuable to-morrow as it is to-day he will de
cline to exchange his commodity against it,
and this Populist agitation threatening the
integrity of money has been the cause of the
hard times through which this country is
passing, aud from which it will not escape
until the heel of popular condemnation is
placed upon the propaganda which under
mines the foundations of credit. [Applause.]
The basis of sound trade is sound money.
[Applause.] Money which is intrinsically
valuable, money which, like the gold coinage
of this country, this country cannot affect if
It tried to. [Applause.] I can take a ten dollar
gold piece and I can defy all the power of all
the governments of this earth to take five
cents of value from it. [Applause.] Having
earned it by the sweat ol my brow, having
earned it by the exerciie of my brain, having
earned it by the exchange of my commodities, I
can go to the uttermost ends of the earth, and
wherever I present it its value will be unques
tioned and unchallenged. [Applause.]
Now let us see How Mr. Bryan proposes to
deal with this question. I looked through his
speech to find out just what he thinks he is
going to do for the laboring man, aud I fa nd
that he dismisses him with very few and some
very unsatisfactory phrases. But it is per
fectly clear that the purpose of the Populist is
to put up the price of certain commodities.
Mr. Bryan's language is that he is going to im
prove the condition of the people of this coun
try; not all of them, but of the greatest num
ber. Well, now, I don't suppose Mr. Bryan
pretends to any miraculous power. I don't
suppose he claims he can multiply the number
of chairs upon this platform or upon tbis floor,
althougn he has shown his capacity to empty
them. [Laughter.] If he is going to work any
change in the conditions of men he must in
crease the material possessions of some part of
the community.
It requires the labor of man and the labor
of man alone to create wealth. If, then, Mr.
Bryan is going to enrich somebody, the thing
i which he means to bestow on him he must
tHke from somebody else. Who is to be de
spoiled and who is to be enriched by the exer
cise of this new scheme of government? [Cry
of "Silver miue owners."] My friends, the sil
ver mine owners will get cheated with the
rest. [Applause.] If ever the Populist obtains
| his way nobody will be benefited, not even
I Mr. Bryan. [Laughter.] I will venture here
to say that if the face of Providence should be
averted from this land, and such a calamity as
Mr. Bryan's election were permitted by it, the
man who would suffer most by that event
wou!d ba the false prophet who, having torn
down the temple of credit and of industry,
would be torn to pieces by an outraged public,
whose prosperity he had ruined.
I Let us folio Â«r this argument a little; let us
! see what he means to do according to his own
i light. We see that he cannot enrich one man
without impoverishing another. A Govern
ment never can be generous, because if it be
generous to one it must be oppressive to an
other. [Applause. [ Mr. Bryan does not pre
tend that by any power given him from heaven
he can find anything on the surface of the
earth that has not an owner, and, therefore,
I he cannot honestly bestow it upon a favorite.
| But his financial scheme contemplates an in
j crease in the price of certain commodities,
i [Cry of "Except gold. "] 1 do not think auy
i thing Mr. Bryan can do will affect gold.
I [Laughter and applause.]
But, my friends, we are coming now pretty
close to the wo-'dpiie behind which the Afri
can is concealed. Mr. Bryan proposes to in
crease the price of commodities. If the price
of commodities be Increased and the price of
labor be left stationary why that means a cut
ting down of the rate of wagesâ if, instead of
a dollar which consists of a given quantity of
gold equal to 100 cents anywhere in the world,
with the purchasing power of 100 cents, the
laborer is to be paid in dollars worth 50 cents |
each, with which he can only buy half as
.much with a day's wages as he buys now.
Wage-earners, Mr. Bryan Â»ays, know that
whiluagold standard raises the purchasing
power of the dollar, it also makes it more dif
ficult to obtain possession of the dollar. They
know that employment is less permanent, loss
of work more probable and employment less
certain. If, tben, it means anything, it means
that a cheap dollar would give him more
employ nient. more frequent employment,
more work and a chance to get re-employ
ment after he is discharged. [Laughter.] Well,
now, if that means anything in the world to a
sane man, it means that if the laborer is will
ing to have his wages cut down he will get
more work.
Mr. Cockran devoted much attention
to tbis particular question. He argued
that there should not be high wages un
less there is an extensive production in
every department of industry, and claims
thai wages is the one sole test of the
country's condition. Continuing, he said :
The Populist loves to say that the creditor is
a person who oppresses the Western farmers.
He loves to declare that the money-lender and
the creditor are synonymous expressions; but
as a matter of fact, the creditors of this coun
try are not the bankers ; they are not the so
called capitalists, they are the laborers, and it
is at the expense of labor that this change is
made. [Applause.] Every great industrial en
terprise has for its chief creditors its own labor
ers. The pretense that the farmer of Nebraska
is suffering under the weight of a mortgage
contracted under a metal which has steadily
increased in value is but a Populistic meta
phor.
Two-thirds of the farmers have no mortgage
debt whatever. [Applause.] Ido not believe
there is five per cent of them that owe a mort
gage over three years old, during which time
I there has been no change in the value of the
metal, but every single farmer is a creditor in
the shape of his own labors. This proposal of
the Populists is an attempt to enlist the farm

WeÂ«tern State which in 1890 and 1892 fel. into
the hands of the I'opulis's went into theFarm
lers- Alliance before their real purpose was
(executed, were purified and Populistic forces
i scattered out of existence when the farmers of
I tbis country understood precisely that what
' the Populists meant for his welfare was really
for his ruin.
He said the Democratic electors who
stood boldly and firmly lor the gold stand
ard at Chicago were submerged by a wave
of Populism from tne South. There has
been, he declared, a great change in the
Democratic organization of tbe Southern
States, and declared :
The men who from a mistaken sense of loy
alty followed their States out of the Union,
whose gallantry in war, whose fortitude in
defeat won the admiration of the civilized
worid ; the men whose virtues commanded the
support of Northern public opinion in the at
tempt to overturn carpet-bag governments in
the Southern States; the men who led their
people through all their troubled period of re
construction back into a full Union with
the sister States, these men, like Hampton
in North Carolina, and Caffery iv Louisiana,
have been swept from power, a new set has
got into the saaale, a set of leaders, of which
Tillman is the exponent, who boldly uniurled
the secessional flag at Chicago, and declares
that this Populist movement is a direct move
ment against the prosperity of the East. Men
oi New York, toilers of America, guardians of
your own homes, will you allow your rate of
wages to ba affected [Cries of "Never 1"
Never!"] by any man who never had paid
wages at *U if he could get out of it? Will
you submit to this conspiracy between the
professional farmers, the farmers who culti
vate the quarrels of their neighbors, farmers
who labor with their jawÂ», Populiit agitators
of the West and the unreconciled slaveholders
of the South. [Applause.]
Tnis is a conspiracy between professional
farmers who vva t to pay low wages and the
unreconciled slaveholder who would like to
pay no wages. [Applause.] Here is the real
root of this conspiracy. Here is the explana
tion of this Populist movement. iMr. Bryan
did not create it. No man can create a move
ment Hie this. The forces that created it are
active and have been working in a thousand
different directions. Mr. Bryan, representing
this theory, is but like a drop of water on the
crest of the wave, more conspicuous, but no
more important than the millions of drops
that form its base. The Populistic movement
Is the attempt of these professional farmers, of
these men who are unwilling to share with
the laborer, to appeal to his greed in support
of their dociriue. He is an enemy of public
order. He is an obstacle to progress. He is a
conspirator against the peace and prosperity
of the industrial classes of the country.
The underlying trouble with all Populisti is
that they have a fundamental conception of
the principle on which civilized society is con
structed. All through Mr. Bryan's speech, all
through Mr. Tillman's utterances in the con
vention wherever you find Populists assem
bled, you will find discussions proceeding
upon the theory that men are hostile to each
other in their interests; that tbe condition of
life is one of contest. At Chicago Mr. Bryan
declared: "When you come before us and tell
us that we shall disturb your business inter
ests, we reply that you have disturbed our
business interests.
"We have petitioned and our petitions have
been scorned. We have entreated and our en
treaties have been disregarded. \VÂ» have
begged and they have mocked, and oar
calamity came. We beg no longer; we en
treat no more; we petition no more. We defy
them." [A voice "That's right."] He was, my
friond, he was quite right. When a man
loses all sense he has a rignt to defy those that
possess any. [Laughter.]
In concluding, Mr. Cockran said he waa
glad this issue bad arisen. The time has
come when the people of this country will
show their capacity for self-government.
When tbis tide of agitation shall have re
ceded, the foundations of this republic
will remain undisturbed. This Govern
ment will still shelter a people indis
solubly wedded to liberty and order;
justly forbidding any distinction of bur
den or of privilege, conserving property,
maintaining morality, resting forever
upon the broad basi3 of American patriot
ism and American intelligence. [Ap
plause.]
Mr. Cockran's speech was well receired.
After talking for one hour and twenty
minutes, Mr. Cockran concluded, and
amid a wild outburst of cheering the audi
ence dispersed.

A YACHT RACE.

Victim of a Collision

OWNER OF THE ISOLDE.
Run Down by the Meteor and
Fatally Injured by the

UNCONSCIOUS IN THE WAT^R
An Accident Mars the Sonth Sea
Regatta of the Royal Albert
Club.
LONDON, Ejto., Aur. 18.â The Royal
Albert Yacht Club regatta was continued
at South Sea to-day over the 46- mile course
sailed yesterday. There was a whole-sail
breeze from the southwest, but the rain
fell heavily. The starters in the big race
were the Ailsa, Britannia, Satanita and
Meteor. The boats were started at 10
o'clock.
The yacht race for small raters started
at 11 o'clock over the same course as that
sailed by the big yachts, but only once
round, twenty-three miles.
The starters were the Saint, Niagara,
Samphire, Audrey. Penitent and Isolde.
While both races were in progress the
Meteor came into collision with the
twenty-rater Isolde, dismasting her and
throwing her crew into the sea. All of the
boats stopped immediately and began the
rescue ot the Isolde's crew, which was
accomplished. Tne races were then aban
doned. The accident happened just at
the beginning of the second round of the
big race.
Baron Ton Zedwitz, owner of the Isolde,
who was on board his yacht, was struck
in the head and face by some of the frag
ments of the masts and other parts of the
boats which tue collision sent flying in
every direction, and was fatally injured.
Baron yon Zedwitz was unconscious when
he was taken out of the water and in this
condition he was Hurriedly conveyed on
board a steam yacht to the clubhouse of
the Royal Victoria Yacht Club at Ryde,
where he received every possible medical
attention.
It is understood that he did not regain
consciousness and that he died very soon
after reaching the clubhouse.
All of the yachts and clubhouses at Spit
head are dying flags at balfmast in conse
quence of the Baron's death. The crew
of the Isolde experienced some very nar
row escapes. The accident cast a gloom
over everything.
The Isolde was examined after being
towed to Portsmouth, and it was found
that, besides being dismasted and having
a. I of her gear swept away, she had a large
ijoie atove in her bow.
The Meteor sustained no injury what
ever by tne collision. The Isolde was a
twenty-rater yacht, constructed by the
Herreshoffs at Bristol, &. L, in 1895 for
Prince Leopold of Germany, who sold the
boat to Baron yon Sedwitz.
Captain Momes, the skipper of the
Meteor, ascribes the collision of the
Meteor with the Isolde to the fact that
the Britannia did not make way for the
Meteor to pass the Isolde.
As a yachtsman Baron Ton Zedwitz was
a great sportsman, and he was well liked
in ail the English sporting centers.
His wife, the Baroness yon Zedwitz, was
a daughter of the late Charles Roosevelt of
New York.
To-morrow's yacht races and the fire
works with which it was intended to
signalize the ending of the Royal Albert
Yacht Club regatta at South Sea have been
postponed until after the funeral.

TAMPERING WITH SOLDIERS.
Prominent Spanish Republicans Arrested
for Their Open Sympathy for
the Cubans.
BARCELONA, Spain, Aug. 18.â Ever
since the recent rioting in this city, the
authorities have been on the alert to pre
vent a recurrence of the disorder. A close
watch has been kept on certain republi
cans, who, in connection with other mem
bers of the party throughout Spain, were
believed to have been active ia fomenting
the late disturbances.
As a result of this surveillance Senors
Marti and Ribot, both republican mem
bers of the Cortes, and fifteen others were
to-day arrested. It is charged that they
are implicated in a conspiracy having for
its object the creation of disorders in con
nection with coming embarkation of re
enforcements for the army in Cuba.
It is believed that the republicans have
made attempts to tamper with the loyalty
of the troops and sought to induce them
mutiny rather than to serve with the col
ors in Cuba.
This plan is thought to -aye been effec
tively frustrated and no trouble is appre
hended until ihe men destined for service
in Cuba, 40,000, are dispatched to the
island.
The most important arrest that has been
made is that of General Estebanes, who
was Minister of War in the republican
government which followed the abdica
tion of King Amadeus in 1873.

Six Men Shot, While the Umpire Gets
Away With the Five Dollars
Stake Money.
POPLAR GROVE, Abk., Aug. 18.â
Negroes from the Polk and the Lowry
plantations met here Sunday to play a
ball game for a stake of $5. William
Griffin, the umpire and an adherent of the
Polk side, neld the stakes. In the third
inning Griffin gave a close decision on a
slide to third base, which greatly incensed
the Poplar GroTeites, who rushed in a
body upon the umpire and his son, the
latter being the scorer for the game.
The umpire grabbed up a vaiise which
he had brought along, opened it and dis
closed several loaded pistols, which he
Handed out to the men of his side. In
stantly the shooting began, and wnen it
ended six men were iound to have been
more or less severely wounded. Israel
Tate of the Poplar Grove crowd was the
only man on that side who had a gun.
He emptied his pistol, retreated, reloaded
ana emptied it again. He is credited with
having shot four men. The only damage
done Dy the Polk Crowd was the shooting
of un innocent outsider, Jack Robertson,
whose Jeft thigh was broken and who is
expected to die.
Deputy Sheriff Filis McCoy summoned
a posse and arrested as many of the par
ticipants as ne could find.
The wounded are William Anderson,
shot through the thigh ; Sumner Sugner,
shot through the side; an unknown negro
from North Creek, shot in the ankle; two
negroes from the Lowry plantation, shot
in the leg; Jack Robertson of Poplar
Grove, shot through tbe breast. Ander
son, Sutmer and Robertson will die.
Israel Tate and Will Griffin, the leaders
of tbe respective sides, were unhurt and
Griffin carried off the stake money in the
melee. Deputy McCoy brought in several
of the negroes to-day and lodged them in
jail.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19, 1896.
WEMILLE'S
MURDER TRIAL
A Jury Not Yet Secured in
the Case of Jo
Gregory.
QUESTION OF COUNSEL.
Judge Jones Adjourns Court to
Reflect on a Motion by
the Defense.
THEOKY OF THE PEOSECUTION.
ETidence and Circumstances by
Which They Expect to Convict
the Prisoner.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Aug. 18.â The
task of impaneling a jury for the trial of
Jo Gregory, accused of complicity in the
killing of Jack Littlefield near Round
Valley, was resumed in the Superior Court
of Trinity County this morning.
Before any jurors were chosen from the
Four of the Men Who Figure in the Trial of the Slayers of Jack Littlefield.
talesmen Oregon Sanders, counsel for de
fendant, made a motion that Judge Jones
associate J. W. Turner of Eureka, Hum
boidt County, as one of the counsel for
the defense. It developed that Judge
Turner is related to the Superior Judge by
marriage, they having married sisters.
The Judge was of the opinion that the re
lationship was a bar to Turner presiding
before him, coming within the provision
of the code of California, section 170, sub
division 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
as amended in 1893, which reads as fol
lows: "When he is related to either party
or to the attorney, counsel or agent of
either party, by consanguinity or affinity,
within .the third degree, computed accord
ing to the rules of law.' 1
A motion was made by C. N. Post that
the court take a recess till the afternoon
session for the purpose of consulting au
thorities upon the procedure.
When court was again called at 1:30
they were unable to arrive at an agree
ment, and it was decided to again take a
recess until to-morrow t morning, when the
advice of Attorney-General Fitzgerald
could be obtained. In dismissing court,
Judge Jones, with some show of feeling,
said:
"Gentlemen of the jury, you heard the
question brought before the court. It is a
vital one, as Mr. Post has well said. If I
prt>ceed with this trial and grant the de
fendant's motionâ which I think 1 must
grant to admit Mr. Turner as associate
counselâ and if it should go to the
Supreme Court and raise the question of
jurisdiction of relationship within the
third degree of either consanguinity or
affinity, and notwithstanding that they
themseives have brought Mr. Turner here,
tbe law would hold that wuere there is no
jurisdiction it cannot be agreed by consent
of parties that Jo Gregory could be tried
before me with my brother-in-law acting
as counsel any more than he could elect
to be tried for this same crime in a just
ice's court.
"We have endeavored to look up the
authorities in this case as well as we could,
but were unablÂ» to do so. After having
discussed the matter the attorneys for the
prosecution will have advice from below,
so as to know just exactly what to do. I
shall therefore take a reces* until some
time to-morrow, according to the motion
made by Mr. Post. The question is a very
important one for me, which now seems
that Mr. Turner can come up here from
Humboidt County and set me off the Dench
any time he wants to. If such is the case,
he is superior to the people of Trinity
County."
In a similar case now pending, that of
Jacob against Lorenz and Leibbrandt,
where Mr. Turner has been connected as
an attorney of record for the plaintiff, a
ruling was made there a week ago by
Judge Jones that be was not disqualified,
though at the time he expressed grave
doubts as to the correctness of the ruling
on the proposition, but said that it would
afford the Superior Court a test case to
construe the ruling of the statute.
Mrs. Mary Williamson and daughter,
the mother and sister of Gregory, were in
court this morningâ the only women pres
ent since the opening of ihe case. George
White, the Mendocino cattle king, is ex
pected to arrive to-morrow. The Long
Ridge witnesses for the prosecution are
camped about half a mile from town at
McMurray's reservation. Everything is
quiet in Weaverville to-night.
The theory which the prosecution will
endeavor to establish is that as Jack Lit
tlefielii was coming southward from sum
mer range toward winter range with a
band of cattle belonging to Yes Palmer,
about November 20, 1895, while in the vi
cinity of Wylackie range, one Hinton
claimed to have been shot by Jack Little
fleld from behind an oak tree in an open j
glade.
After the shot was fired Vinton, know
ing he was wounded, remained sitting on
his horse for two minutes watching the
assassin run down the hill, and then be
coming faint fell from his horse and made
his way to the Hayden cabin, about half
a mile. He told the Hayden family he
was badly wounded, and asked them to
send for the doctor, Bill Espee under
took the errand, but did not get the doctor
till 10 or 11 o'clock the following day.
Mrs. Hayden asked Vinton who shot
him, and he positively affirmed "Jack
Littlefield." Then John Crow appeared,
and being asked the same question, an
swered the same. Crow volunteered to go
for an officer, and arrived at Constable
Van Horn's at 9:30 p. M.
Van Horn asked Crow the cause of the
trouble, and he replied that Viuton had
been shot by Jack Littlefield, and wished
him to be arrested. He told him, how
ever, "there was no hurry â in the morn
ins would do."
Bayliss Van Horn, Gordon Van Horn and
Johnnie Crow, the arresting posse, started
about 9 P. M. on November 25, 1895, and
they arrived at Hayden's place about din
ner time (noon), where, it is supposed,
they lormed a plot to assassinate Little
field.
Wishing to escape earshot from the
women folk and Dr. Goyer they went to
the barn on the pretext of doctoring a sick
horse, L c., Gregory, Bayliss Van Horn,
Fred Radcliff, John Crow, Hayden, Buck
Lacock and Vinton.
Radcliff was detailed to watch the forks
of the Red Mountain trail in anticipation
of a surprise, Hayden was to watch the
crossing of the Wylackie trail, Vinton to
watch from Hayden's uouse the forks of
the Eel River and Red Mountain trail, and
Buck Lacock was on the Hayden trail half
way between the forks oi the trail and the
Red Mountain House.
Bayliss Van Horn and Jack Crow, Con
stable and deputy, were to arrest Jack
Littlefield and bring him over the Wy
lackie trail and detain him some thirty
minutes on the pretext of cinching their
horses and guessing at the time of day, as
they bad arrived earlier than they had an
ticipated.
After leaving Palmer Corral, riding In
dian fashion on the Wylackie trailâ Van
Horn ahead, Littlefield in the center and
Crow behindâ crossing the ridge about
sundown, they passed Gregory, who, it is
supposed, fired the first shot from behind
a manzanita bush.
Littlefield fell from his horse across the
trail and staggered to his feet, when he
received a Bhot fired by John Crow which
killed him. A third party coming up
supposed to have been Gregory or Buck
Lacockâ fired at close range, burning Lit
tlefield's hair and mutilating his features,
after which the balance of the party ar
rived and hanged the corpse to a pine tree
ciose to the forks of the trail, about two
miles from Red Mountain House, and
then dispersed.
Van Horn considerately put himself to
the trouble of informing Uncle Billie
Atkinson, Justice of the Peace, that an
unknown mob had taken his prisoner
from him and lynched him. A Coroner's
jury was formed of the supposed partici
pants, and he (Litllefied) was given scanty
burial near the pine tree upon which he
had been hanged.
The official Coroner of Trinity County,
arriving on November 27, exhumed tne
body, rendering a verdict that he came to
death at the hands of an unknown party.
COPELO'S MURDER MYSTERY.
A Coroner's Jury Fails to Find Who
Killed Sherman,
UKIAH, Cal., Aug. 18.â An inquest on
the body of James D. Sherman was held
before acting Coroner Joel Eveland, at
Covelo, last Thursday, and a report of the
same was received at the District Attor
ney's office to-day. The Coroner's jury
consisted of: A. C. Perry, R. F. Gilmore.
John O'Neill, W. F. Whitney, F. W.
Youree, E. A. Robneson, L. D. Montague,
Henry Marks and G. W. Duncan.
Testimony was adduced by John Bishop,
who found the body of Sherman shortly
after he was shot, and Brady Tuttle, who
saw tracks near Sherman's body and heard
a gunshot fired about thirty minutes be
fore the body was found. J. H. Rohrbough
testified to finding a cartridge-shell near
the body. Dr. C. R. Aiken testified that
Sherman's wound was caused by a bullet
from a 38 or 40 caliber rifle, and that
in his opinion Sherman was shot by
some party directly in front and a trine
to tne right, with a rifle elevated some
what above the level of the throat. Su
pervisor Jacob Watten burger testified to a
difficulty Sherman had with one John
Valleliy'last winter.
Mrs. Sherman related the incidents of a
controversy between Sherman and one
Rodgers a short time ago. Mrs. Allie
Sherman also stated that her husband at
one time told her that a brother of Mike
Meagher, for whose murder Sherman had
been tried in Kansas, had threatened dur
ing that trial to Kill him if he had to fol-
Jow him to the end of the earth.
After hearing the testimony the jury
found that the name of deceased was
James Dinie! Sherman, a native of Mis
souri, aged 46 years, and that he, on
Augus* 11, about 8 o'clock p. m., on the
premises of Sanders Hornbrook, came to
iiis death from a gunshot wound at the
hands of parties unknown.
UndeT Sheriff Philo Handy left for the
scene of the murder on Saturday, and with
the Covalo deputies investigated the mat
ter. It is said that Sherman was em
ployed by Mrs. Williamson, stepmother of
Jo Gregory, charged with the murder of
Jack Littlerieid, to search lc- evidence in
Gregory's behalf. Another clew on which
the Sheriff's office is working is that Sher
man was qnietlv investigating the murder
of Charles Felton, committed three
months ago, and had made important dis
coveries. Developments are eagerly
awaited.

VANCOUVER, B C, Aug. 18.â Gold
is being discovered in every conceivable
place in the province. Tbe latest mining
sensation comes from Eburne, B. C, near
the fishing town of Steveston. A laboror
boring for water brought up peculiar look
ing black sand on his drill. A friend stand
ing by made thÂ» remark that it was gold
bearing sand. The dirt was nssayed and
ran in sample $1000 to the ton. The la

NOGALES. Abiz., Aug. 18.â A special
from the Tucson Border Vidette, received
at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon, reads:
"The United States soldiers ran on
twenty-three rebels near Olive Camp, who
opened fire, wounding three soldiers seri
ously. The soldiers returned hre, killing
three rebels and capturing twenty and are
now bringing them to Tucson. A courier
from Olive Camp says the soldiers took a
Winchester rifle with a silver-mounted
stock from them."
Tne news has created considerable excite
ment in Nogales and Colonel Bacon began
wiring to get news from his commanding
officers in the field. Captain Hare of troop
X, Seventh Cavalry, from Huachuca,
finally received a telegram from United
States Marshal Meade, stating that he be
lieved the report false.
Olive Camp is a little mining place sixty
miles north of Nogales, eight miles west
of the Tucson and Nogales stage road and
twenty-five miles south of Tucson.
The Indian Joseph Salcedo, brought in
last night, is on the list of the original nine
teen rebels, and has been identified as one
engaeed in the fight of the morning of the
12th. All the prisoners were given a hear
ing to-day before United States Court Com
missioner Taylor and plead not guilty.
The hearing was postponed to await the
arrival of the United States District At
torney. There is much speculation as to
whether they can be turned over to the
Mexican Government. Once across the
line short work would be made of all of
them.
It is reported here "to-day that the Mexi
can Government has already made a requi
sition on the United States Government
for Lauro Aguirre and Teresa De Cabora
and her father, who is with her at El Paso.
The Indian prisoners say her father is
more to blame than she, as the girl does
about as he wants her to. Aguirre is the
worst, they say, as he has control over
Santa Teresa's father. Aguirre is a highly
educated man in his language, but a heavy
drinker and nearly always under the in
fluence of liquor. He is a very sour man
and is a sort of an anarchist. Many
Americans here who took part in the fight
are now afraid that he may take a notion
to have them murdered.
They believe he couid have it done by a
word if he saw nt. If the Mexican Gov
ernment gets him he will not have any
body killed. It is estimated by the Mex
ican officials here that he and Santa
Teresa by their influence have caused the
death of more than 1000 people in the last
six or seven years. None of the Yaquis
who quit work on the railway and who
were around town the day before the at
tack on Nogales returned to work or re
turned to get their pay. Work on the
building on which they were employed
has been suspended.

NOGALES, Akiz., Aug. 18.â Dan Mc-
Cunningham, United States Livestock In
spector, who came from Bisbee this morn
ing, says Customs Inspector Sam King,
Del Lemer and four other men, who ar
rested Bod Forester, one of the Nogales
bank robbers, at Bisbee on the 10th inst.
and turned him over to Sheriff Leather
wood of Pima County, went on after the
robbers the same morning and have not
since been heard of. It is thought they
struck another trail or part of the gang
that ambushed Leatherwood and posse on
the 12th and are still following it or all
have been killed.
If not heard from in a few days King's
brother will leave with a party to look for
them. The country which King and his
party went is very rough and infested by
hard characters who belong to the gang
of robbers. It is easy for the posse to be
ambushed and killed. Leatherwood and
posse are still out. If the two posse could
eet together they would stand a better
show to get the robbers.
Colonel Garcia, with his twenty- five
cardados (''hangers"), has had two of the
gang corralled in a cave in the Ajo Moun
tains in Sonora for several days. He can
not get to them and they cannot come out,
though their friends have gone there sev
eral times with provisions. Garcia saya
he will stay till they come^out.

Parmillion was found dead in bed at his
residence on the Guerneville road this

the day. An inquest will be held.
VALLEY ROAD AFFAIRS,
Right-of-Way Troubles at Fresno
Stop Extension ot the
Track.
San Joaquin Valley Farmers Are
Shipping Much Grain Over
the New Line.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 18.â The track
layers on the Valley road will leach Bel
mont by to-morrow at noon. Here the
work of throwing up a grade and laying
track will cease, and to-morrow afternoon
175 men will be dismissed from the com
pany's employ. It is understood that no
further work will be done in the way of
extending the track until the question of
securing the ri?ht of way through Fresno
has been settled. The grade and track
to Belmont is exceptionally good. Division
Superintendent McFarlane has worked
his men hard and spared no effort to make
a perfect roadbed. For some time past a
gang has been surfacing the last stretch
of track put down and to-morrow will
press on to Belmont, which is but a short
distance from Fresno.
Around Fresno the Valley road people
nbw have a number of employes, and it is
understood that preliminary surveys are
being made with a viewof running around
the raisin city if its citizens do not see fit
to do as other communities have done
who realize the great benefits that will
follow the advent of the Valley road into
their midst.
In Stockton work is progressing rapidly
on the big brick roundhouse in the south
western part of the city and it is fast near
ing completion. Much grain is now com
ing in over the people's road, and the
farmers of tbe San Joaquin Valley are
already feeiing the benefits that come
from a competing road, just now the
Valley road people have about all the
pram they can handle, and the Southern
Pacific Company is learning what it is to
have a lively competitor in the field.

A SE NATOR TALKS.
Senator White Speaks Under the Auspices
of the Lou .'nqrles Free Silver Club,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 18.âSen
ator Stephen M. White opened the cam
paign for the Democracy in this city to
night in a speech of over an hour's de
livery, under the auspices of the Bryan
Free Silver Club, in East Los Angeles.
The hall where the meeting was held was
packed with people, many of whom were
women and children. The seating capacity
of the room was entirely inadequate, and
in consequence more than half of those
present remained standing during the
meeting, which lasted over two hours.
Senator .White was preceded by local
free-silver speakers, who made precious
little impression on the audience.
The Senator devoted his time to an en
deavor to show tnat what the country
needs is silver money and plenty of it. As
a United States Senator be said his first
duty was to answer a call by President
Cleveland, who convened Congress in
1893 for the express purpose of repealing
the purchasing clause of the Sherman act
He was told, he said, that such repeal
would bring good times and prevent a
great calamity to the country. The re
peal was effected, but times grew worse,
instead of better, fie pleaded for silver
as the money of the people, and said this
Nation should act as a sovereign and for
the interests of her own people.
BURGLARS AT EL MONTE.
Carry Off and Blow Open the Railroad
Company's Safe.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 18.â Early
this morning burglars broke into the rail
road depot at El Monte and carried the
iron safe 300 yards away and then blew it
open to find nothing of value, for the safe
contained only a few papers. That they
were amateurs is best shown by the tools
used to gain an entrance â a leaf from a
buggy spring. The bungling burglars first
secured entranoe through an outside win
dow, after which they pried open the door
from the inside. Sheriff Burr was at El
Monte all the morning examining the
premises, and found a clew or two which
he feels certain will lead to the apprehen
sion of the burglars. The safe was a valu
able one and the damage done the build
ing is considerable.

Lob Gatos, Cal., Aug. 18. J
A regiment of the regular United States
SOLDIERS IN REPOSE AT CAMP CITY GUARD.
army passing through Los Gatos furnished
a diversion early this morning to the
members of Company B who were not on
guard duty in camp.
The First Regiment Infantry, in com
mand of Captain Parker, who is acting
colonel, comprising several companies of
forty-eight men each, has been marching
by easy stages from Baa Franoisco to
Santa Cruz, where they will go into a two
months' camp for instruction and an out
ing.
Company B of the First left camp early
this morning with drums beating and
colors flying to meet their brethren of the
regular army. They marched down Santa
Clara avenue, and formed into line at
parade rest in the outskirts of the town.
As the United States troops moved past
the National Guard presented arms, the
marching regiment returning the salute
with arms "aport."
They marched through Los Gatos with
out stopping to rest, and went into camp
at Alma, about two miles below town, in
the mountains. The regular army looks
upon the National Guard as their younger
brothers, and the feeling between them is
quite cordial.
Company B then returned to the parade
ground and had an hour's active exercise
in extended order drill.
A shooting range has been picked out
and a rough target was put up this morn
ing. The day has been exceedingly warm,
but Captain Filmer, who is anxious to get
some work out of camp as well as play,
has kept his men banging away, spatter
ing lead in the target and in the surround
ing mountains.
This morning Captain Filmer received a
letter from John Peter Paul Rupp of San
Francisco, a former corporal of Company
B, that he would give a gold medal to the
man making the largest number of 2's in
ten shots. Two is the lowest mark that
can be made. The result will probably be,
that the poorest shot in the company will
not get the medal, as the best shots are
likely to train their shots for the two
mark instead of the bullseye.
Guard mount was held about 4 o'clock so
that the officers could get away early, and
about 4:80 Captain Filmer, First Lieuten
ant Sturdivant, Second Lieutenant Ramm
and George H. Adams, secretary Los
Gatos Board of Trade, drove out to Alma
on a visit to Captain Parker, commanding
the regular troops. The National Guards
men were well received and remained to
dinner with Captain Parker.
All the officers showed a great deal of
interest in the release of the carrier
pigeons, Dick and Mary, with a message
for The Call. The use of the pigeons was
to test their reliability as a means of com
munication in time of war when other
means of communication might be cutoff.
The regular army officers watched the
pigeons go into the air with undisguised
interest. This is the third flight to their
loft at the residence of John Filmer at
422 Jersey street in San Francisco that
Dick and Mary have recently made from
this vicinity. They did not take much
time in getting away, bat went almost
straight up into the air and then darted
off in a straight line for the City. The
message that they carried yesterday was
lost on the way, but the birds were ship
ped back this morning to try it over
again. Dick cooed intelligently when the
message was tied to him.
To-nieht the camp presented a brilliant
appearance. Green boughs ornamented
the front of the tents, and the broad ave
nuo between was illuminated by many
Japanese lanterns. Hundreds of prome
nadeâ¢ and visitors admired the decora
tions, which were indeed pretty.
A huge bonfire burned under the trees
and threw its red glare on not less than
500 visitors, who had assembled to hear an
impromptu literary and musical pro
gramme. Dr. W. H. Siebersi officiated
both as interlocntor and end man, and the
Company B "Maccaroni" string band fur
nubed the music. Ed L. Fiiruer stepped
out into the ruddy glow of the fire and
sang. It was encored; in fact, every
thing was encored, even to the guard
house, which collapsed after Filmer
had stopped singing. Henry Osthoff
indulged in some ludicrous German
specialties. He was so funny that
Townsend's brown dog, which he found in
his tent last midnight and thought was a
bear, went out near the fire, pat down,
looked at Osthoff, wagged his tail and
howled for joy.
Dr. W. H. Sieberst of the company
musicians recited in inimitable style a
parody on Poe's "Raven," in which
bologna sausage and steam beer was
mixed up with poetical sentiment. For
an encore he sang in a key that paralyzed
the "Maccaroni" band into complete
quietude, and he finished the tone: alone.
When the programme was concluded all
had their choice of lemonade or cucumber
punch, which was set out lavishly on a
long table ornamented with Japanese
lanterns. To-day rehearsals began for the
production of a farce-comedy entitled
â¢'Her First Love," which will be given in
tne dancing pavilion next Thursday even
ipg. Miss Emilie Sieberst takes the part
of the heroine of the play. Miss Sadie
Gould of San Francisco came down from,
the City this afternoon to visit Mrs.
Robertson of Los Gatos and friends in
camp. Other visitors in camp to-day
were Colonel W. H. Menton, excursion
agent of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, and Rev. Father O'Connell of
St. Theresa'a Parish. A large crowd is
expected down from the City next Friday
to attend the grand ball given Company
B by Los Gatos citizens in Masonic Hall
that evening. The guardsmen are guests,
but the townspeople will be charged an
admission fee of $1 per couple.
A McCALMONT SPECIAL,
Monterey and Capitola Surprised
by tha English Multi-
Millionaire.
Hires a Train as He Would a Buggy
in Old r to Keep an Ap
pointment.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aug. 18.â Hugh
McCalmont, an Englishman worth proba
bly ? 150,000,000, a winner of a Derby and
who believes so thoroughly in the effect
iveness of California climate in producing
good horseflesh that he has shipped some
of his horses to this State, was at the Ho
tel del Monte yesterday. Mr. McCalmont
wished to drive over to the Hotel de Capi
tola to join his two sisters, but was told
that he could not make the trip by team
in time. He then declared that be would
go by train, but was informed that the
last train for the day had gone.
"You can run another?" he asked the
agent at Monterey.
"Yes," the agent said, "it is possible, of
course."
"Then get me a train," he said
quietly. The train was provided, the
price was named and paid and the multi
millionaire boarded it with as little con
cern as he would have taken a seat himself
in an electric streetcar, and was whirled
away to Capltola.
Mr. McCalmont'a arrival at Capitola cre
ated as much astonishment there as bis
departure had at Monterey, since the resi
dents and visitors were unaware of any
change in the schedule time of trains, and
did not understand the cause of this arrival
at an extraordinary hour.
SAVED BY A DOG.
Mrs. Wenkt Loses Her Bouse and Xar~
rourly Escapes Cremation.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aug. 18.â Mrs.
Louis Wenks was awakened at her home
on the Soquel road long before daylight
this morning by the howling of her dog
that she had permitted to remain in the
house for protection while Mr. Wenks was
absent in San Francisco. Bhe was startled
and confounded by the peculiar action of
the dog, which was standing over her. She
knew that no housebreakers or other
marauders had caused the dog's actions
and soon discovered that the house was
burning. The prompt warning given by
the faithful brute saved Mrs. Wenks' life,
but it was too late to save any of the con
tents of the house. Being alone and be
yond the limits of Santa Cruz there was
no help at hand, so she could only await
the destruction of her pretty borne. The
value of the house ana contents was esti
mated at $6000, which was fully insured.
The Wenks home was one of the prettiest
country residences in the county and was
an attraction to visitors driving between
Santa Cruz end Soquel. The flre origin
ated from an exploded lamp.
Electricity for Monterey.
MONTEREY, Cal., Aug. 17.-Arrange
ments have been completed for the plac
ing of the large electrical plant at the
Little Bur River, twenty-four miles down
the coast from Monterey. The surveyors
are now at the Little Sur, making a final
survey.
The power from the first plant can be
furnished at such a nominal cost that all
the mills, the Del Monte and the present
Electric Light and Power Company, will
be compelled to usÂ« it. The work will
probably be completed by spring, when
the horse-car system that now runs from
Oak Grove to Pacific Grove will be con
verted into an electrical road. This will
be a great thing for Monterey and Pacific
Grove, as the forty-eight minntes will be
reduced to almost a quarter of that time.

Suggestion That He Be Seized
and Taken to a Leper
Settlement.
CORDIALLY HATED B7 COOLIES.
Denounced as a Traitor Who Has
Gained His Great Wealth by Rob
bing the Poor.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 18.- It is
well understood among the small army of
Chinamen in British Columbia that Li
Hung Chang, Viceroy of China, fears to
return to the Orient by way of San Fran
cisco, owing to the hostility of bis coun
trymen in the State of California. In
Britlsn Columbia there may not be the
same organized hostility to the Viceroy,
but the ill feeling toward Li Hung Chang
is, nevertheless, universal among the Ori
entals here. One prominent agitator
makes bold a suggestion through the local
press that the great Chinese be seized and
taken to the leper settlement on the lonely
Darcy Island, 13. C, as a life prisoner. It
is a settled fact that Li. Hung Chang will
return to the Orient by the Canadian Pa
cific Railway and steamers via Vancouver,
and to avoid any possibility of a hostile
demonstration he will be quietly con
ducted to the steamer in waiting with
other passengers. No civic reception will
take place. Prominent Chinamen here
give as their reason for this hostility that
Li Hung Chang has spent his life making
money out of his country and people until
he is the richest man in the world, and
that at heart he cares nothing for the
country or the downtrodden cooly whom
he spurns under his foot.

SANTA CLARA ASSESSMENTS.
Supervisors Appear Before the State
Board of Equalization in Behalf of
Their County.
SACRAMENTO, .CaI., Aug. 18.â Officials
of Santa Clara County appeared before the
State Board of Equalization yesterday.
Its representatives were Assessor L. A.
Spitzer and Supervisors Groeninger and
Ayer.
Mr. Spitzer maintained that his assess
ment was as near correct as possible, but
asked that if any change be made in the
roll it be made in the shape or a re
duction. When asked if his solvent
credit assessment was not very low
he stated It was all he could un
cover, though he had no doubt that a
large amouat existed which had not been
returned. He stated several instances
where he had made assessments arbi
trarily on credits, which had not been
return ea.
All tillable land in Santa Clara County,
even that lying on hilltops, was assessed
as high as $60, and all city property in
proportion. When asked in regard to
land lying along the Alameda line he
stated that Alameda was assessing lands
along the line higher than interior lands,
while on the Santa Clara side the valua
tion increased toward San Jose.
Controller Colgan moved that Mr. Spit
zer be sabpenaed to appear as a witness
when Alameda County came before the
board. Both Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Ayer
stated their willingness to appear when
requested.
KIDNAPING AT TACOMA,
Two Children and Their Step
mother Who Cannot Be
Found.
The Father Arrested for Perjury on
Complaint of His Brother
in-Law.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 18.â John M.
Roberts, president and manager of the
Pacific Piano Company, is having much
tronbie over the custody of his two daugh
ters, Olive and Maud, aged 11 -and 13.
They are the children of his first wife, who
died last spring. After her death Roberts
employed as housekeeper one Josie Brown,
who has subsequently been proven by
municipal court records to have twice
paid a fine for running a disorderly house.
Three weeks ago Dr. W. E. Burkhart,
uncle of Roberts' children, and other rela
tives asked to have a guardian appointed
for them on the ground that Roberts' com
panion was not a proper person to care for
them. This move Roberts checkmated by
promptly marrying Miss Brown and the
case was dismissed.
Later the petition was renewed, with the
request that Or. Burkhart be appointed
guardian. Municipal court records were
produced to show the character of Roberts'
new wife. During the hearing the chil
dren were left in Coroner Park's office.
Mrs. Roberts soon afterward left the court
room quietly, and since that time neither
?he nor the children have been seen here.
The court has been conducting an inquiry,
so far unsuccessfully, to ascertain who
abducted them. Dr. Burkhart was ap
pointed the guardian the same hour Lhat
they disappeared.
To add to the mystery, Attorney
Frank Cushman, one of Roberts' counsels,
disappeared at the same time and cannot
be found. Last Thursday Dr. Burkhart
swore out habeas corpus proceedings, re
quiring Roberts to produce the children
on Saturday or Bhow cause why. The
case was continued to yesterday, when
considerable testimony was taken.
Roberts testified that he had neither seen
nor talked with Cusbman or the children
since August 10, when they disappeared.
Things came to a climax to-day when
Roberts was arrested on two charges of
perjury, preferred by Guardian Burkhart,
who alleges that he swore falsely when he
stated that he had not seen the children
or Cushman since the date specified.
Roberts was released on bail, pending
hearing to-morrow. It is believed the
children were taken to Victoria.
REDDING STAGE HELD UP,
A Tall Highwayman Demands
the Express Box and Gets
a Way Pouch.
The Driver Considers the Robber a
Green Hand at the
Business.
REDDING, Cal., Aug. 18.â About 1:30
A. M. Jasper Hampton, who was driving
the Redding and Bieber stage on its way
to this city, was startled by a tall highway
man stepping out from behind a tree,
leveling his gun at him and demanding
the express box. Mr. Hampton informed
him that he did not carry express matter,
whereupon the "knight of the road" de
cided be would be satisfied with the mail
bag. The driver complied with this re
quest, but threw him the way pouch,
leaving the through pouch in the coach.
The robber picked up the sactand made
his way into the brash and the stage was
driven on. There were no pas'engers at
the time of the hold-up. Mr. Hampton,
who is an old stage-driver, considers the
highwayman a green hand at the busi
ness.

AN ASTORIAN'S FATAL TALL.
Drops From the Fourth Story of n Xeut
Brewery.
ASTORIA, Ob., Aug. 18.â John Sandy,
a laborer, fell Irom the fourth story of
Kopp's new brewery this afternoon and
received injuries that will in all probabil
ity prove fatal. Sandy was unloading
brick from the elevator when the accident
occurred. The elevator is a temporary
affair, run by a donkey engine stationed
on the first floor. Hearing the bell sound
the order to lower the engineer complied
with the signal, but almost immediately
he heard the cry "Slower." The next in
etant the body of Sandy struck one of the
beam* on the second floor and then con
tinued its flight to the floor beneath.
When picked up the unfortunate man was
conscious. A frightful gash had been cut
in his head and he was internally injured.
He was taken to St. Mary's Hospital, but
no hopes are entertained for his recovery.

ANGRY UNION PRINTERS,
Sacramento Typos Denounce As
persions Cast Upon the
State Office.
Dec are That the Management of the
Institution Is in Every Way
Above Reproach.
SACEAMENTO, Cat.. Aug. 18.âTypo
graphical Union No. 46 held a special
meeting to-night at Trades Union Hall to
consider tbe resolutions adopted at the
Fresno convention reflecting on the man
agement of the State Printing Office. Sev
eral members denounced the resolutions
and characterized them as malicious and
unfounded. After thoroughly discussing
the subject the following resolutions were
adopted :
Whereas, State Typographical Union No. 6,
which met in the city of Fresno on August 13
and 14 1896, adopted resolutions, in one of
which the following language appears: -It
has been brought to our notice tbat the Cali
fornia State Printing Office bu been con
ducted in a manner that reflects discredit on
the craft of this Ftate; and, wnereas, the sub
ject-ma ter of said resolution has never been
canvassed or discussed by any of the subordi
nate union* represented at said State Typo
irraphical Uniou, and the delegates thereto
had never been instructed to consider or take
action in relation thereto; and whereas, .vale
Typographical Union therefore acted without
official information or authority iji the passage
of such a resolution, in which the integrity
of fellow-craftsmen in good mauding is
gratuitously and publicist assmied with
out investigation and without cause;
and whereas, such action by the State Type
graphical Union could haveonly bepn induced
by the most muHcious misrepresentations and
untruthful assaults upon the iniegrity and
good name of our local craftsmen, inspired, as
we believe, by some one who imagines that he
has a grievance against the present State
Printer, Hon. Ay J. Johnson; therefore, be it
Resolved, That Sacramento Typographical
Union No. 46, in meeting assembled, does
hereby disclaim being a party to the unwar
ranted attack on organized labor made by the
Bute Typographical Union at Fresno, and also
affirms that our delegate to said State Typo
graphical Union was not instructed or ex
pected to assail his own union or any part
thereof. .
Jttsotved, That we emphatically repudiate
and condemn the Fresno resolution above
quoted and resent the imputation tbat our
fellow-members employed at the State Prim
ing Office are a discredit to the craft of this
Hes'o'ved. That ye disapprove the attitude of
E. I. Woodman, our only delegate to the State
Typographical Union at Fresno, in his acqui
escence iv the passage of the resolution re
ferred to.
Benolred. That we heartily approve the action
of State Printer Johnson in the preferment he
has always shown organized labor in the ex
clusive employment et onion men in the van
ouÂ« departments of Mate Printiug Office, and
we gratefully acknowledge his valuable aid in
preventive a reduction of wages in said office,
ihu< assisting in the maintenance of a fair
standard of wages throughout the State.
Resolved, Thai a copy of these resolutions be
sent to Governor James H. uudd, to sister
unions througnout ;he State and to the press
under the seal of this union.

"CAPITAL AS AN AGENT."
Instructive Discussion of the Subject by
the Political Economy Club.
The Political Economy Club held an
interesting meeting last night at 15 South
Park. J. Munseli Chase in the chair.
Professor Carl C. Plehn of the University
of California read a well prepared paper
on '-Capital as an Agent of Production,"
at the conclusion of which several mem
bers joined in tne discussion of the ques
tion.
After defining capital as goods used in
the production of other goods, Professor
Plabn showed that the recent financial
disturbance was due not to a lack of money
in the country but to a failure of faith
among the owners of money, which caused
them to hoard rather than to invest their
capital. This contraction caused the hard
times, as it ever will.
The Political Economy Club decided to
hold meetings weekly until next Novem
ber, in order to give opportunity for the
discussion of the many phases of the
financial question, now so prominent a
factor in the present political campaign,
it was also decided to take action looking
to the formation of a library of economic
science, and to this end a contribution of
Dooks and pamphlets relating to economic
questions is solicited.
The next meeting of the club will be
held on Tuesday evening next, at the
Methodist Episcopal Church on Howard
street, at 8 o'clock. Colonel John P. Irisn
and Edward F. Adams will discuss the
silver question, Colonel Irish taking the
side of gold and Mr. Adams the opposite.
The meeting will be public

asserted that the accommodation provided
at Jackson-street wharf was inadequate
for the Handling of the Sacramento River
produce and one and all joined in a plea
that Pacific-street wharf should be as
signed to them. John D. Spreckels, on
behalf of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany, interposed an objection. He .said
his vessels would require botb sides of Pa
cific-street wliarf while the Folsora- street,
structure was being rebuilt. He was
offered the sole use of the Lombard-street
pier, but pointed out that ocean steamers
could not lie there for any length of time
with safety.
The discussion was started by a com
munication signed by over forty fruit
dealers and commission merchants. In it
they stated tbat the present facilities were
totaliy inadequate for the handling of the
fruit and general produce that comes from
tbe interior during this season of the year.
Captain Nelson of the California Trans
portation Company made a strong plea for
more room. "When we first started run
ning steamers on the Sacramento River
all the fruit that came down could be
handled in one truck," said he. "Now we
bring down daily over 500 tons and a third
of it rots on the wharf because the wagons
cannot get down to handle it Morning
after morning East street is blocked be
cause there is so much fruit piled up on
the wharf that tbe teams cannot move
around and take it away. We handle the
fruit from five counties and over 300 ship
pers send their fruit to this markei on our
boats. Fully 300,000 people are supplied
from Jackson-street wharf and there is not
a pier on water front that tarns as
much revenue into the board's treasury.
While ocean steamers should be en
couraged I think that interior travel has
tbe first call on the Commissioners."
James McDonougb, of McDonongh &
Runyon, presented the commission mer
chants' sfde of the question. "We must
have more room," said he. "At the pres
ent time we cannot even give the fruit
away, because there is no room on the
wharf in which to handle it. I am not
particular as to which wharf yon give us,
bo lone as we get one wnarf all to our
selves. If we can get Pacific-street, so
much tbe better; if we cannot, then let us
have Jackson street."
"Pacific-street wharf has been rented to
the Oceanic Steamship Company," inter
posed Commissioner Cole. "Perhaps we
;an make some arrangements witn Mr.
Spreckels. 13 there no other wharf you
;an move to wnile Folsom is being rebuilt
for you?"
"We have made all our arrangements to
move to Pacific street, " was the answer,
"and I don't think mere is any wharf on
tbe front that would suit us as well."
"How would LomDard-street wharf do?"
itked Commissioner Coin on. "The rep
'esentatives of tbe Japanese steamship
me have expressed themselves as satisfied
with it."
"Lombard street is all right for a short
;ime, but the position is too exposed for a
vessel to lie there for ten days or a fort
light," was tbe answer. "Nevertheless
[ am willing to do everything in my
power. Still I consider Pacific street the
>nly available place for tne Oceanic Steam
ship Company s vessels."
J. F. English addressed the board and
asked for the use of Jackson street if Pa
cific could not be secured. He pointed
out that two of the Oceanic Company's
steamers could be docked there and still
room be left for several river steamers.
He suggested that the Napa boats and
the Caroline be docked at Pacific and all
of Jackson given up to the Sacramento
River boats.
Chief Wharfinger Root explained that
the Sacramento River boats had at the
present time almost the entire use of
Jackson-street wharf.
After a few moments' thought President
Colnon said: '"I think some concessions
must be made, Mr. Spreckels. We will
provide accommodations for your Aus
tralian and Hawaiian steamers and your
tugs must remain at Howard street.
Then the Napa .and other small river
boats can dock in tbe space that was de
signed for the tugs. In order to protect
you the commission will provide a watc.i
man and will have one of the fireboats
with steam up at the wharf every night.
These farmers and fruitmen have a big
call on us and we must do all we can for
them."
Mr. SprecKels at once gave in and tbe
matter was settled. "Then we are to have
Jackson-street wharf entirely?" queried
Mr. McDonongh. "Certainly," said Mr.
Colnon, and the fruitmen were more than
pleased. It was also expressly stated that
Pacific-street wharf had been built for the
fruit trade and as soon as Folsom-3treet
wharf was rebuilt and the Oceanic Steam
ship Company moved back there Pacific
street would be turned over to them.
The Commissioners next took up the
proposed changes in the new ferry build
ing. The first three were disposed of in
short order, as Chief Engineer Holmes
showed conclusively that the late A. Page
Brown had provided in his plans for all
the emergencies. In order to improve tho
appearance of the building Architect
Swain wanted the pilasters left out. This
the commission did not consider a neces
sary change and refused to entertain it.
The proposal to change the angles that
will fasten the ironwork to the stone and
the change in tne steel brackets and iron
plates were also rejected. The proposed
changes would have cost an extra $7000,
and as Mr. Holmes showed that they
would not add to tbe stability of tbe
building they were one and all "rejected.
At the same time Architect Swain was in
structed to prepare detail drawings for the
completion of the work as designed by A.
Pai;e Brown.
The trouble over the misfit of the iron
work of the new depot has been traced to
its source, and it may seem strange to re
late that in making a copy of Architect
Brown's original plans for use of the Ris
don Iron Works the copyist mistook tbe
numerical figure 3 for a figure 5 and with
a stroke of the pen practically moved the
big structure two feet beyond the limit
prescribed for it on tbe finished founda
tion.
Superintendent of construction Robert
son and Chief Engineer Holmes have
worked over the plans for several days
and are now able to announce that the
depot building will not suffer damage
from the miscalculation.

GOOD AND BAD SOLDIERS
Report of Captain F. de L. Car
rington on the State
Militia.
Officers Should Be Paid and Not
Elected, and Cavalry Should
Be Disbanded.
Captain F. de L. Carrington has sub
mitted to the assistant adjutant-general
his report of his inspection of the National
Guard of the State. He makes several im
portant suggestions, among them that
captains (and lieutenants when cam
manding company) should receive pay
for cheir services. Not less than $30 per
month, lieutenants with company $10 per
month, and first sergeants $15 per month.
He estimates that this would require an
appropriation of just $47,520 as the guard
is not constituted.
He does not think the elective method
of obtaining officers is the best, because
personal feelings enter so largely into the
matter of the choice. The report says:.
The guard, so far as the ordinary company
drill goes, is generally well Instructed, but the
proficiency varies very much in the different
companies of each regiment, especially where
they are separated. A number of companies
appeared to poor advantage, as will be seen
below. While some companies will naturally
excel others, there should be no such marted
difference as exists between the best and poor
est companies of each regiment. After careful
consideration of the condition in which each
I company was found at the inspection, as to
drill, discipline, soldierly appearance, etc., I
find the infantry companies stand as follows,
assuming the maximum to be 5:
Excellentâ Company B, Beventh Infantry,
4.80; Company F. Fifth Infantry, 4.75; Com
pany X, First Infantry, 4.75; Company F,
First Infantry, 4.75; Company I, Seventh In
fantry, 4.75; Company C, Second Infantry,
4.75; Company M, First Infantry, 4.60; Com
pany G, First Infantry, 4.60; Company Ci
First Infantry, 4.60.
Very goodâCompany B, First Infantry, 4.50;
Company H, Sixth Infantry, 4.50; Company
A, Second Infantry. 4.50; Company- X, Seventh
Infantry, 4.50; Company Â£, Sixth Infantry,
4.40; Company D, First Infantry, 4.37; Com-
Fany G, Sixth Infantry, 4.37^ Company G,
iith Infantry, 4.37; Company B, Fifth In
fantry, 4 37 ; Company L, First Infantry, 4.35 ;
Company E, Seventh Infantry, 4.3s; Company
F, Sixih Infantry, 4.30; Company A, Fifth In
fantry, 4.25; Company D. Fifth Infantry, 4.2s;
Company G, Second Infantry, 4.25; Company
to, Seventh Infantry, 4.25: Company C, Fifth
Infantry, 4.25; Company H, Second Infantry,
4.20; Company D, Seventh Infantry, 4.20.
Goodâ Company C, Sixth Infantry, 4.00;
Company F, Seventh Infantry, 4.00; Company
B, Second Infantry, 4.00; Company I, First
Infantry, 4.00.
Fair â Company B. Sixth Infantry, 3.87;
Company H, Seventh Infantry, 3.75; Company
D, Second Infantry, 3.75; Company H, Fifth
Infantry, 3.75: Company A, First Infantry,
3.75; Company H, First Infantry, 3.75; Com
pany E, Fifth l ii .'an try, 3.65; Company A,
Sixth Infantry, 3.60.
Poorâ Company E, Second Infantry, 3.50;
Company G, Seventh Infantry, 3.so; Company
C, Seventh Infantry, 3.50.
Very poorâ Company L, Seventh Infantry,
3.25; Company F, cecond Infantry, 3.2s; Com
pany D, Sixth Infantry, 3.25; Company E,
First Infantry, 3.25; Company A, Seventh In
fantry, 3.00.
It will be noticed that the Seyenth In
fantry holds the first and last places on
tbe list, Company B the beat and Com
pany A the worst in the State.
The three signal corps are given much
credit, and stand in the following order of
merit: First, Becond Brigade, Ban Fran
cisco; second, First Brigade, Los Angeles;
third, Third Brigade, Sacramento.
\\ ith regard to the cavalry the report
says:
It is difficult In the National Guard to bring
cavalry up to a high standard of efficiency,
and it is very expensive. I think it would be
of much more benefit to the Scate to maintain
less cavalry and more infantry. To that end I
would recommend the mustering out of two of
the troops now in existence aud the organiza
tion of four companies of Infantry in tneir
stead. There would be no increase of expense ;
and then a would be practicable to organize
another eight-company infantry regiment by
taking four companies from one of the nrelve
company regiments, preferably the Seventh,
as the First Brigade has but one regiment, and
should have at least two.
If this is not done I would recommend that
the Los Angeies troop be disbanded and alight
battery of four (tuns be organized and equipped
with modern steel gun*, to be located at san
Francisco or lios Angeles. At present there is
no artillery, and no serviceable guns-except
Gatlings, and there should undoubtedly be
one well-equipped battery as a part ot the
State forces.
If iour troops of cavalry are continued in
service it might be well to form them into a
battalion for administrative purposes and
place it in command ot a major or lieutenant
colonel, who should be a man well suited for
the position.
The report makes the following other
important recommendations:
The guard is badly in need of a proper field
equipment, especially overcoat*, blankets,
shelter-tents, cacteeDS, Haversacks, tin cups,
meat-ration cans, knives, forks and spoon?, as
well rs company field cooking outfits, Buzzacot
ovens, or camp-kettles, messpans, etc. No
time should be lost in supplying them.
The medical department needs reorganiza
tion, and proper legislation looking to H should
be invited at the earliest moment possible. For
State troops I think it is probably better to
maintain a regimental than a general medical

be one surgeon, and an assistant surgeon for I
each battalion, with an adequate number of |

WILL DROP THEIR SUCKS
The "Call" Chapel to Go on an
Outing to San Rafael To-
Morrow.
"Typos" Will Leave Their Cases and
Take at Least One Day in the
Country.
For a day and a night the members of
The Call Chapel will drop their sticss,
and for the time being the composing
room will be in the hands of the "subs."
They are going on an "outing" to San
Rafael to-morrow, and for a day type and
column, rule and lead will be forgotten,
and spiders will weave over the empty
cases.
Every year The Call Chapel sighs for
the woods and the open air, and then it
takes its wives and its daughters, its
sweethearts and its friends, and the hurry
and rush of a newspaper office is left be
hind. Dancing and singing, lunch in the
open air and under the trees of some park,
and a forgetfulness of everything metro
politan is sought and achieved.
To-morrow R. J. Espy, Miss M. Isaacs,
F. Hochdorffer, T. Burke, William H.
Bowen and J. S. Phillips, who form the
committee, will have charge of things,
and Mitce .Lynch will vacate the copy
cutter's desk in the office to take charge of
the dancine floor at San Rafael. Assisting
him will be a floor committee composed of
Ed S. Belcher. A. F. Smith, G. E. Mit

gauge ferry at 9: 15, and there will be many |
wh<Twill not return until the last boat.
There are about 150 belonging to The \

"subs.'' Many have served at tiieir cases in '
The Call composing-room a great many |

Oraranizatlon of the Irish-American
Republican Clubâ An Invi
tation.
The Irish-American Republican Club,
for the purpose of the coming campaign,
organized with the following permanent
officers: John J. Coffey, president; Mar
tin Fragley, vice-president; Thomas C.
Maher, second vice-president; Martin
Murray, secretary; Arthur McGurren,
treasurer; executive committee â James
Gilleran (chairman), Captain C. D. Doug
las, James Carr, Thomas Conners, D. M.
Cashin, Thomas Desmond and Frank Mo-
Manus; finance committee â Arthur Mc-
Gurren, Frank McManus and Martin
Murray.
The following preamble and resolutions
were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, The Democratic party was elected
under false promises to the American people;
and whereas, it has been in charge of tbe Gov
eminent for the last Tour years; and whereas,
its administration has been a total and la
mentable failure and an administration of ex
periment, first, in the reduction of the tariff,
thereoy cutting off the source of revenue to
support our Government, and also has been
the means of closing down our manufacturing
industries; and whereas, the Democratic
party, weeing the error of its administratiou
and to add insult to Injury, has bonded our
country in a time of peace to the extent of
$600,000,000, and as a last resort and being
ashamed ot its administration of incompe
tency and in order to deceive the American
people it foolishly resorts to its false doctrine
of free silver, which will be as disastrous as
free trade; therefore be it
Retolved, That we as Irish-Americans, after
due deliberation and after giving the Demo
cratic party a fair and impartial trial,
come to the conclusion that we can trust them
no longer, and we most respectfully invite our
Irish fellow-citizens to join us in our efforts to
defeat the party who, after four years, have
proven themselves false to their pledges, fa!s-j
to* the American people, false to the manu
facturing industries, false to the laboring
classes, and to false that their own party fails
to indorse them.
Speeches were then made by T. Con
ners, who served in the same regiment as
Major "VfcKinley and who is now an en
thusiastic member and officer of the Irish-
American Republican Club; also by J. J.
Coffey, Martin Murray and A. McGurren.
A meeting will be held on Friday even
ine for the purpose of arranging for the
opening of the campaign on Saturday, at
a place to be hereafter announced.

GARRET A. HOBAST, of New Jersey
EtKCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1898.
Even in his moments of rest Bryan talks
too much.
There is no need for McKinley to take
the stump; his record speaks for him.
Revive American industry and more
than half the money trouble will be over.
The >ew Yorkers are having their own
fun with Bryan, but he hasn't sense
enough to know it.
Reducing the value of the dollar to 53
cents will injure the wage-earner and
won't help silver any.
Democracy may hide itself from the
tariff issue, but it can never hide the tariff
issue from the people.
If all that the Democrats promise were
good for the people, who could be sure
they would keep the promise?
Bryan is rolling around in the sunshine
now, bnt it goes without saying he will
strike a frost before November.
Bryan taffy may please for a time, but
as a permanent thing people would rather
have McKinley and prosperity.
The home market is the best market for
the American producer, provided it is pro
tected from foreign competition.
It is possible that in his secret thought
Bryan decided to make his first speech in
jÂ»ew York by way of trying it on the dog.
The free coinage of silver on the Demo
cratic plan would virtually reduce the
wages of every workingman by fully one
half.
lf^ Tom Watson submits to Bryan's
scornful treatment much longer he will be
either more than human or something de
cidedly less.
Some Democrats profess to believe that
Bryan will be elected, but none of them
can be found going around buying silver
on a speculation.
Under Democratic conditions all prod
ucts are necessarily cheap, because no one
earns wages or profits enough to buy them
and keep the prices up.
Every vital issue of the campaign was
summed up in AlcKinley's terse state
ment: "Better open our mills to the
â workin^men of America than our mints to
the silver of the world."
The Platte River is over 2000 miles long,
bnt is nowhere deep enough to float a flat
boat, and it is quite appropriate, therefore,
that Bryau's speeches should have won
him the title of the Boy Oiator of the
Piatte.
Before the campaign progresses much
further the people will understand the
money question as well aa that of the
tariff, and then the silver monometallists
in tbe country will be about as scarce as
the free-trailers.
In preparing Bryan's Chicago speech for
use as a campaign document it is said no
less than 118 changes were made in the re
vision, and now thÂ«s question arises
whether tbe document when issued will
be the speech that was made or another
speech masquerading under an assumed
name.
The Chicago convention stole the name
from the Democratic party and the plat
form from the Popalist party; and the
men who managed the double robbery
now have the impudence to claim that
both Democrats and Populists should
condone the fraud by supporting the Chi
cago ticket.
Woman's Republican clubs are expected
to do some of the most effective work of
the campaign in the East this year, and it
goes without paying those of California
will be equally helpful. No class of people
have a better understanding of the need
of protection to home markets and home
industries than do the women who keep
the homes.
Men who have money in savings banks,
men who have life insurance policies,
veterans who have pensions, creditors of
all kinds, clerks with tized salaries and
workingmen with regular wages will nil
be sufferers should the Democratic policy
of siiver monometallism be carried out â
unless, indeed, it should be carried out on
a stretcher in November and buried.
The proposed raising of the assessment
of San Francisco by the State Board of
Equalization is something in the nature
of an outrage and the evil is all the greater
because the Board of Supervisors having
allowed rich corporations to shirk their
taxes, the increased burden will fall
wholly upon the honest taxpayers, many
of whom are already taxed as heavily as
they can bear.
McKINLEY AND WAGE-BARNERS.
Undoubtedly the managers of the Re
publican campaign know their business.
While the Democratic managing commit
tee is "running a show" with Bryan as the
chief attraction, McKinley clubs are being
formed wherever there is an industrial
plant or other business enterprises tbat
give employment to men. It is doubtful
if such enthusiasm was ever before seen in
labor circles this early in the campaign,
and what is more, the request for organ
ization come? from labor. "McKinley
clubs," numbering a thousand or more
members each, are being organized in all
the Eastern and Middle States business
centers.
There is no beating of drums or "I'm
bound to blow my horn if I don't sell a
fish, 1 ' but simply a burning desire on the
part of wage-earners to help bring about
conditions tbat will secure to them steady
employment at satisfying wages. It is
business with them. They have had a
hard time to live during the last two and
a half years, and they are satisfied that
there can be no change for the better until
the cause which has brought all their
troubles upon them is removed. For two
and a half years the Wilson-Gorman tariff
act has been a good school-teacher, and
business and labor have been very apt
students. It is doubtless true, as has been
asserted, that more people have informed
themselves on the tariff question since
Cleveland's inauguration than in all the
previous history of the country, and un
fortunately for Bryan's candidacy the
people are now thoroughly convinced tbat
protection is the basis of prosperity in this
country.
We said it is unfortunate for Bryan that
the people are now so well informed en
the tariff question, but we do not mean
Bryan regrets that he is a free-trader, for
however much or little sincerity there
may be in his advocacy of free-silver coin
age, there is no doubt about his friendship
for free trade. There is no doubt at all
that Bryan believes it to be the duty of
the Government to place the Nation upon
as near free trade as possible. In fact,
Mr. Bryan believes any kind or form of
protection is contrary to the spirit of the
religion he professes; that it is better for
the nations to have free and unrestrained
trade relations, and that the law of the
survival of the httest should prevail. Mr.
Bryan is a sincere believer in the right of
every man to buy and sell in any country
without paying tribute to any one, and no
doubt his well-known public utterances
on the tariff question are having much to
do with persuading wage-earners all over
the country to organize McKinley clubs.
But, any way, industrial operatives are
getting in line for protection and good
wages. _____________________
"TRUE DEMOCRATS."
The appeal of the executive committee
of the National Democratic party to "all
true Democrats" to repudiate Bryan and
Sewall and send delegates to the Indian
apolis convention comes of necessity from
the action of tbe Chicago convention.
There is no doubt that the Chicago con
vention was dominated by Populists, nor
is there any doubt that the traditions and
principles of the Democratic party were
made to give way to the most glaring
political heresies and fallacies, but it was
all done in tbe name of and with the
party's machinery.
It cannot be said, however, that the bolt
ers withdrew because they could not them
selves secure any of the loaves and fishes,
for none of them were candidates for any
office. If the old traditions and principles
of the party are to be preserved, the ne
cessity for holding another convention is
clear, for aside from the tariff question,
the Chicago platform declares for theories
of government which the Democratic
party has been fighting against all its life.
The Democratic party has always stood
for the gold standard. It has declared
repeatedly for an international agreement
to open the mints to silver in unlimited
quantity for free coinage, but it never
mads any effort to secure an international
agreement.
It is true enough that the Democracy
has always held that silver should be in
cluded in the monetary system, but that
tbe Government sbould com it on its owu
account so as to keep the volume of siiver
dollars within the ability of the treasury
to maintain them at par by indirect re
demption in gold. In view of the fact ti.at
the Chicago convention atandoned tbe
leading principle of, tbe party it became
necessary for tbe old leaders to either hold
another convention and thus prepare to
rebuild the party in 1900 or abandon
Democracy altogether. It would be hard
to say bow much the Indianapolis ticket
will hurt Bryan, but if the National
Democracy fuses with Republicans where
ever they could by com Dining elect a Con
gressman, and in States where by fusing
McKinley's chances would be removed
beyond the danger point, no doubt Bryan
would be considerably damaged. But
aside from all that, the Simon pure Demo
crats had to provide for another conven
tion or go out of the business of being
Democrats.
THE ENEMY OF LABOR.
If Bryan and his managers were actu
ated by pride of country in demanding
the adoption of a financial system inde
pendent of other nations, and were they
moved by true patriotism when they insist
tbat the United States are big enough and
strong enough to legislate for the people
without asking the advice or soliciting the
assistance of other countries, they should
be commended for their zeal, however
mistaken their policy might be. But they
are not so actuated and moved, and they
themselves prove they are not every time
they appeal to the people to" indorse their
wild, reckless and selfish theories â wild
because they reject sober thought, reck
less because they are indifferent to the
good of the people, and selfish because
they aim at enriching those who dig silver
from the mountain at the expense of those
who dig grain from the valley.
When not divested of its hypocrisy the
sentiment tbat we should manage our
financial and other affairs independently
of other countries appears to glow with the
enthusiasm of deep-rooted patriotism, but
wnen the sentiment, as expressed by Mr.
Bryan, is stripped of its veneering there
appears the most glaring inconsistency
and insincerity of purpose. He tries to
arouse a patriotic feeling in the people
that they may assart their financial inde
pendence of other countries tbat the prod
uct of American silver mines may be
elevated to ;he importance and value that
pold sustains, but he refuses to adopt a
protective policy that the wage-earners of
America may atsert and maintain their
independence of the pauper labor of other
countries. Mr. Bryan glories in the power
of tbe United States to double the price of
silver bullion, and witn an assumed patri
otic toploftiness demands that iue Na
tion's power ba so employed, but he de
nies the right of the Nation to use its
power to secure to its own people employ
ment at living wages.
Mr. Bryan demands tbat the property
of the Bimetallic League sball be made
highly profitable by National legislation,
but he denies the right of the Government
TJHJfi SAJN JfKAJSCISCO CALiL,, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19, 1896.
to exercise its power in the defense ol
shops, mills and factories against similar
industrial enterprises in other countries.
He insists that American wage- earners
shall face the low-wage labor of Europe
and go to the wall if they cannot stand
the competition, but owners of silver
mines shall have their profits doubled.
He demands that our farmers shall stand
upon equal footing with South American
and Russian farmers in our own markets,
but those who happen to own silver
producing land shall be made the Govern
ment's favorites. It is not free silver coin
age to increase the volume of our money
that Mr. Bryan wants, but to increase the
market price of silver. Mr. Bryan is the
friend of silver mine owners, bat he is not
the friend of any other business interest
of the United States. What Mr. Bryan
demands for Americans is free silver coin
age without any safeguards; free Ameri
can markets for the world's pauper labor
product; free American markets for
foreign farm products and wool, and free
American markets for the finished product
of the industries of every country on the
earth. If American farmers, mechanics
and labor are desirous of conditions of
that kind they will be sure to have them
if they will give Bryan the chance to
"raze the National custom-houses to the
ground." ____________ .
THE COUNTY ASSESSMENT.
The action of the Merchants' Associa
tion in appealing to the State Board of
Equalization against any increase in the
assessed valuation of San Francisco prop
erty is a matter of no little importance to
honest tax-payers. Tbo association asks
for an extension of two weeks' time in
which to prepare statements and evidence
for submission to the board, and this being
granted the case of tbe county is by no
means hopeless, for on the very face and
open showing of the facts there are valid
and sufficient reasons why the assessment
should not be raised.
The resolutions adopted at tbe meeting
in the assembly-room of the Mills build
ing on Monday make a clear enough state
ment of the main facts involved in the
issue. They set forth that the assessed
valuation of property in this county ex
ceeds in many instances its actual value,
and tbat in spite of the general hard times
and depression in values of all property
the assessment roll has been raised in the
present fiscal year about $30,000,000 over
that of last year. The valuation of prop
erty in San Francisco is comparatively
higher than in other counties of the State
and it would be a manifest injustice to
add anything further to the burden of
taxation upon property-owners.
Tbe evil of the threatened increase of
taxation is tbe more serious because the
Board of Supervisors has permitted sev
eral of the richest corporations in San
Francisco to play the part of tax-shirkers.
thus throwing an undue proportion of
taxation upon honest taxpayers. This
wrong of the Supervisors cannot be reme
died by the Board of Equalization, and
therefore if the assessment of the county
is raised it will still be tbe honest tax
payers on whom the burden will fall and
many of them are already carrying as
heavy burdens as they can stand. The
action of the Merchants' Association is in
the direction of protecting the interests
of the county and the rights of honest tax
payers and is entitled to the most respect
ful consideration from the Equalizers.
THE CITY CREDITORS.
One of the worst features of our munici
pal affairs is the debt owed by the City to
creditors whose claims are in every re
spect just and fair and yet which the City,
by the technicalities of law, cannot pay,
even though it wishes to do so and is
abundantly able to do it. It would be
hard to rind a greater travesty upon jus
tice and law than is exhibited in this sit
uation, and it certainly is most desirable
that some remedy for the evil be found
and the debt be paid.
Whatever course the lawyers of the
creditors may be able to find for getting
their clients and the City out of the tangle
will in all probability find a cordial sup
port from the people generally. There
will be certainly no opposition from fair
men to any policy thai promises a fair set
tlement of these municipal obligations.
It is believed that a direct vote of the peo
ple would, if given in tbe affirmative, be
sufficient to authorize the payment of tbe
debts. If that is so then by all means let
us have one. San Francisco cannot afford
to defraud her creditors even when the
curiosities of law seem intended to pre
vent her from paying her debts. She
justly owes the money and har people will
vote to pay it.
A FREE MARKET NEEDED.
The demand for a free public fruit and
vegetable market in San Francisco is about
great enough to brush aside all objection.
Tbe enormous receipts of fruit in the last
few days, and the dumping of tons of it in
the bay because there were not buyers
enough at standard prices to consume the
supply, have created a sentiment for a free
market that is bound to grow nntil a mar
ket is established. The poor are not al
ways able tv buy fruit at standard prices,
and until there is a place where tbe fruit
grower can take bis goods and deal direct
with consumers tbe bay will continue to
be a depository for fruit.
It is a reflection upon San Francisco to
have tons and tons of the best fruit in the
world wantonly destroyed, simply be
cause there is no way by which the fruit
grower can reach the consumer; besides,
if there was a free market tbe poor could
always supply their needs at prices which
they could afford to pay, but they are be
ing denied advantages that should accrue
to them, and growers are being deprived
of the right to sell, because the consumer
and the fruit-grower have no common
meeting ground. It is to be hoped that
the agitation of the question, which seems
to have begun in earnest, will increase un
til ample free market facilities are pro-
Tided.
PARMERS AND FREE TRADE.
It is a fact known to every man who
ever stopped for half an hour to glance at
tbe census of the United States that
farmers cbnatitute about half the popula
tion of America.
It is shown in an article in the local
columns of to day's Call that the farmers
of the country always suffer under free
trade and tbat the McKinley bill offered
them so much protection that it was
called "a farmers' bill."
A close study of the question shows that
the competition of India and Argon
tina Is of such a character as to affect the
American farmer seriously. Falling
prices are seen to be due to free trade, and
the conclusion becomes inevitable that no
class of the population is more benefited
by protection than the farmers.
DIFFICULTIES.
Washington Star.
"One of the hardest things in making a
speech," said the old campaigner, "is to say
just what you mean."
"Yes," was the reply, "that's pretty hard.
But once in a while It's a good deal harder to
mean just what you say."
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
The American miners who went to far
Alaska are not all convinced that it is a wise
thing to leave so good a mining country as the
Pacific Coast and run the chances of striking
a fortune in the bleak and oftentimes frigid
regions of the Northland.
Henry Smith, who has been In tho vicinity
of Forty Mile and Circle City for the last
seven or eight years, and B. C. Stickney of
Montana, who went to the Yukon four years
ago, have lately arrived here and are at the
Buss.
"I wouldn't advise anybody one way or the
other," said Mr. Smith. "No matter what you
say, they won't believe you. Better let them
go and find out for themselves. That's the
best way.
"Probably, for men who merely labor and
have no hope of doing anything else, they can

Wilds, and Who Is Now at the Russ.

do better in Alaska than here. They can get
?10 a day thereâ that is, good miners can.
But the best they can do they can't work over
fifty days, the seasons are so short. Frost
comes on and shuts everything down. Fifty
days is a big average.
' 'Then, it costs a man ?200 to $400 for a
year's outfit. He has got to pay for his food
and clothing whether he works or not.
"Grub into the camps sometimes costs as
much as 40 cents a pound for freight. This is
on top- of the original cost in Circlevtlle or
Forty Mile. There supplies cost about like
this: Flour, $8; bacon, 30 to 35 cents a
pound; sugar, 25 cents; tea, $1; beans, 12 to
15 cents, and dried fruit from 25 to 30 cents.
"Beans, bacon, flour, suear and dried fruit
constitute the principal food, it all depends
how short the supply gets whether you have
to pay more. As the supply gets short the
price is raised.
"I suppose there are about 200 people in
Forty Mile now. Last winter 500 men win
tered at Circle City. Of course there are a
great many men scattered out in the hills
from these points.
"At this time of the year, and for some time
hitherto, the pine and hemlock trees are all
leafed out, and the country looks well. There
is grass of different kinds, too, but iv winter
all this is changed. As 1 said, I wouldn't at
tempi to advise anybody about Alaska. It is
better that people do as they please."

LABOR'S "CROWN OF THORNS."
Chicago Times-Herald.
If the Boy Orator of the Platte had closed
his fervid peroration with the words: "You
shall not press down upon the brow of labor
this Wilson tariff crown of thorns" he would
have uttered a sentiment that would have found
ringing response among the toiling thousands
and his sacrilege would have been more par
donable.
Btatistlcs, which are furninned in plenty, are
not needed to prove that the Wilson tariff law
has been a crown of thorns for American
labor. The most superficial observation will
suffice to impress a candid mind with this
fact.
The report of the Commissioner of Labor for
the United States, covering the period from
1891 to June 30, 1894, shows that during the
year and a half under the Wilson law the loss
of wages to employes was $15,979,093 more
than under two full years of McKinley protec
tion, and that 242,245 more employes were
made idle by strikes and lockout* under Wil
son tariff than under two years of protection.
Five million spindles in NewKngland are idle.
Statistics from fifty-seven trades in New York
City, August 4. 1893, showed tnnt 36.177 were
out of employment in these trades alone. Re
turns frÂ»m 100 manufacturers in the State of
New York show that where 22,026 people were
earning wages during 1892 there were only
17,480 persons employed during 1893, a de
crease of 21 per cent. Coming down to 1894,
steady work was given to only 12.650 persons,
a decrease of 42^ per cent from 1892.
During the last year of the McKinley tariff
Europe bought $700,870,822 of our goods,
while we purchased goods to the value of
$295,077,865 in Europe, leaving a balance of
$405,792,957 in favor of American labor.
During the first year of tbe Wilson law we
sold Europe $634,503,492 worth of goods and
bought European products to the value of
$431,514,024, leaving a balance of only $202,
--989,468 in our favor. The difference between
the balance under the McKinley law and the
balance under the Wilson law is $202,803,489,
one of the "crowns of thorns" that have been
pressed down upon the brow of labor.
This gives but a faint suggestion of the size
and weight of the "crown of thorns" that has
been pressed down upon the brow of the
farmer.
Mr. Bryan will find that the "crown of
thorns" that will be cast aside by American
labor next November Is the oue that was fitted
upon the brow of labor by the Fifty-third Con
gress.
PROTECTION FIRST
Ked'ands Citrograph.
We believe just as firmly in the coinage of
American silver into American dollars, and we
believe in a lot of them, but we will never
vote to place in the Presidential chair any
mÂ«n that is a traitor to the great American
principle of protection to American produc
tions. That is the first principle la American
politics, and we are ready to accept protection
to American industries, coupled with Ameri
can bimetallism, which means that every
American dollar should be equal to every
other American dollar.
WHEN McKINLEY WAS A COOK.
Chicago Kecord.
"Speaking of McKinley," remarked a voy
ager from Kansas, "did any of you fellows
ever hear that he used to be a cook?"
"No," responded the chorus.
"Well, he was," retorted Kansas. "That's
straight. He was once a cook and he got $13
a month wages."
"What are you givin' us?" asked a quiet
young student from Columbia College who had
been out in the copper mines at Butte.
Whereupon there was a hearty laugh and
several irrelevant suggestions were offered,
when the Kansan resumed:
"There's a fellow by tue name of Wagner out
in our town who claims that William McKin
ley, who is now a candidate for the Presidency,
used to cook for him and that he was the worst
cook he ever ate after. His biscuits were as
heavy as lead and his coffee was like the Mis
souri River â all color and no taste. He could
fry bacon pretty well, Wagner says, but any
body can fry bacon. All you've got to do is to
put it in the skillet aud turn it over now and
then."
"Where was this cooking?" asked the Paw
tucket man. "They were camping out,,weren't
they?"
"Yes; down 1n West Virginia during the
war. Wagner was a member of the Twenty
third Ohio Infantry, which was McKinley's
regiment, and belonged to Company K. Mc-
Kinley was detailed as company cook, and the
men kicked so Sard that they got him pro
moted to commissary sergeant, so that he had
to hustle for the grub, whils some one else
cooked it."
A WAIST WITH VEST AND
REVERS.
Trim round or slightly pointed waists, well
fitted with long revers and plastron or vest
effects, are very popular for costumes of woolen
fabrics. Contrasting fabrics and colors may
be used for plastron and revers, making it pos
sibl* to give very stylish combinations.

the back, formed by back, side-body and under-
arm forms. There Is but one dart either side

Grand. He brought down the papers on r.p
peal in the Ã. D. Worden case, and filed them
in the Supreme Court here yesterday. "In
Yolo and Sacramento counties," said Mr. Hus
ton, "there is considerable interest in the case.
Worden is the only one of those who were ar
rested who was convicted, and the feeling is
that he should not be hanged. If the case is
sustained as it is I have uo doubt petitions
will be circulated asking for executive clem
ency, and that the sentence be changed to im
prisonment for life."
A. B. Wood of Detroit, the widely known
Western miue manager and expert, is at the
Palace. In the flush days of Leadville Mr.
Wood was one of the most conspicuous figures
there. He had much to do with developing
| some of the largest deposits of silver car- j
| Donates, and has since been identified with
gold and silver mining in other parts of tho
country. In later years he has been the man
ager of the Montana Ruby and Sapphire Com
pany (limited), the shares of which are owned
almost exclusively by British capitalists. The
ruby and sapphire mines are on the Missouri
River, a lew miles from Helena. A large
amount of the gems have been got out and
have been cut and sold in different parts of the
world. ________________

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
AN S. P. IMPOSITION.
unfair charges made on thk saw pablo and
Tulark Extension.
Los Banos, Cal., Aug. 11, 1896.
Editor of San Francisco "Call"â Dkab Sir:
About two weeks ago I wrote to the Board of
Railroad Commissioners asking the proper
method of bringing to their official notice an
imposition on the part of the Southern Pacific
Company in connection with the road mown
as the San Pablo and Tulare Extension. No
attention was paid to my letter, not even to
the extent of acknowledging the receipt
thereof. I have tried for lour years to have
gome notice taken of the matter, unsuccess
fully. The point in question is this: The road
following the west side of the San Joaquin
River from Tracy to Aurora, with a connection
from Collis to Fresno, is called the San Pablo
and Tuiare Extension. Why San Pablo and
â¢why Tulare the Southern Pacific Company
does not explain. The "extension" is ac
counted for by the "extension" of the pas
senger rate from 3 cents to 5 cents per mile.
For further particulars see extortion.
This road Is called a "branch line." Here is
a list of its trains: No. 19, Atlantic express;
No 21, freight; N0. 23, Sunset freight, limited;
No. 79, way freight and passenger; No. 119,
freight. One local and four through trains
each way is pretty good for a "branch," and
the Sunset limited to New Orleans, their crack
flyer, used to run over this "branch" also.
If one buys a ticket from San Francisco to
Fresno, one may travel at one's option over
the main line via Merced and Modesto, or over
the "branch" at the same rate. It is only
when one stops at a point between Tracy and
Armona that the "branch" gets into good
working order. In this latter Contingency one
must pay 5 cents per Southern Pacific mile for
each and every mile traveled over the
"branch." Thus it will be seen that the
"branch" is comparatively "innocuous" so
long as one starts from no point on it nor
stops at any point within it. Something like
the old story of the boy and the bee. The boy
was all right so long as the bee only walked
over him, but when the bee sat down on him
it was .
After this explanation of the situation, If
you will kindly inform me of the proper
method of procedure to obtain relief, I, along
with several hundred other persons, will be
greatly obliged to you. Yours truly,
C. F. uertholf.
THE SILVER MARKET.
IF THE BBTANITKS AfcK RIGHT THKKB Is A
Good Chanci fob Speculation.
San Fkancisco, Cal., Aug. 17, 1896.
Editor of San Francisco "Call": If the elec
tion of Mr. Bryan aud the attendant conse
quences of free coinage at 16 to 1 and full
legal tender of silver are assured, as Is so con
fidently claimed by many, and if these things
will firmly establish the parity of silver and
gold on the 16 to 1 basis, why is it that the
shrewd ones are not buying silver bullion,
which is now worth 69 cents per ounce and
will then be worth $1 29 per ounce? Our sil
ver dollars, sustained by the credit of the Gov
ernment, are now worth the same as gold dol
lars, and the advocates of free coinage argue
that with free coinage they will still be equal
to gold dollars. They can now take silver dol
lars and bur nearly double th* quantity of
silver bullion the silver dollars c ,ntain, and
with the enactment of free coinage can have
their bullion coined free of charge into the
same kind of dollars.
Surely sn investment which will realize
nearly 100 per cent profit in a few months is a
good thing in these dull times. If all these
things are as certain as the Examiner would
have us believe, why does not the silver mar
ket show some sign otifl 8. N. Wycxoff.

SCHOONER OLGA
A TOTAL LOSS,
She Was Cast Away in
the Amoor River,
Siberia.
Off HER WAY TO JAPAN.
Was to Have Loaded Tea at
Kobe for San Francisco and
the East
ONLY PABTIALLY INSURED.
News From the Whaling Fleet Is Not
Very Encouraging So
Far.
The well-known four-masted schooner
Olga is probably a total loss in the Amoor
River. Captain Charles Nelson, the man
aging owner, has received word that the
vessel has been ashore for two weeks and
that the chances of getting her off are
very slight.
The Olga left here several weeks ago
under charter to Hawley Bros.' Hardware
Company. This firm has been supplying
much iron and other ware to the Trans-
Siberian Railway and its mines. After
discharging her freight the Olga was on
her way from NicoJaefski, Siberia, for
Kobe, Japan, to load tea for San Fran
cisco when she went on the mud flats and
stuck hard and fast.
The Olga is one of the fleet of coasting
vessels that has made a name for California
shipbuilders. She is one of the first ves
sels turned out by Captain Matthews from
his Eureka shipbuilding yards and has
aiways been considered one of the smartest
schooners afloat. The Olga was 164 feet
long, 36 feet beam and 12 feet deep. Her
loss is partially covered by insurance.
The tug Fearless will not go out with the
whaling cruise next Saturday. The ex
cursionists who are going on the Queen
made a kick and demanded that two of
the whaling crews be stationed on their
boat. It was finally decided to pnt all
four crewi on the big steamer and dis
pense with the tug. Should no whale be
caught during the trip a schooner will be
in readiness off the Farallones with two
weeks' provisions aboard, and the whalers
will be transferred to her and the hunt
continued until one of the mammals is se
cured.
The schooner Queen has been chartered
by the North Pacific Packing and Trading
Company and will sail for Alaska in a few
days to bring down a load of canned
salmon.
The schooner J. B. Leeds sails on
Thursday for Central American ports
with a large cargo of general merchandise.
The bark Martha Davis is now out
thirty-three days from Hawaii, and the
friends of Captain Soule are wondering
what is the matter. Everybody expected
him to make a fast run, as the gallant
skipper was due in Chicago on the loth
inst. to get married. His fiancee is wait
ing and watching for him, and in the
meantime the Martha Davis is being car
ried all over the ocean by light winds and
baffling cvi rents,
Ex-Judge James G. Hayden of the
steamer Tiburon is nowadays being con
gratulated from morning till night. He
is a "forty-niner" and one of the "rets,"
and also the father of a bouncing boy that
was born last Sunday. The Judge is one
of the proudest men on the water front
to-day.
The steamer Monticello broke down last
Monday night and the tug Vigilant made
the evening and morning runs in her
place.
News from the whaling fleet states that
the Hidal'/o had 700 rounds of trade bone
and the Rosario 2900 pounds of the same.
Both vessels report that whiJe they have
been out there were only two occasions on
which they sighted a whale, and then it
was too rou?h to lower a boat.
TALKS ABOUT SUFFRAGE.
Parlor Meetings or Informal
Conversations Are in
High Favor.
Miss Anthony and M ss Hay Address
a Large Gathering at the
Hotel Wenban
A new feature in the woman suffrage
work which has not yet received public
notice, and which has none the less proved
signally successful, is the series of informal
parlor meetings recently inaugurated.
There is something about these homelike
gatherings which seems very attractive to
the participants. No objectionable pei
sons can be present, as the guests are all
specially invited, and the prestige given
the movement by means of this social
apostolate in high circles is incalculable.
Night before last one of these parlor
meetings took place at the Hotel Wen
ban. The attendance was large and ap
preciative, and nearly filled the billiard
room, which had been magnificently deco
orated for the event.
Mrs. Blitz made a most charming host
ess, seeing that all her guestÃ were thor
oughly at home before the speech-making
commenced. Miss Anthony ma ie an ini
promDtu address on the cause to which
she has devoted over half a century of her
I life. The talk was interruuted by ques
j tions and comments, being, in fact, a con
versation in which the gifted veteran
suffragist took the lead. Miss Hay also
spoke on the subject in her usual convinc
ing style, her spirited replies to questions
calling forth many a burst of applause.
"What a pity, though," exclaimed Miss
Anthony, casting her glance over the
friendly faces which surrounded her,
"you are all suffragists, or at least not
anti-suffragists. What I want is a gather
ing of honest enemies in onier to show
them the fallacy of their position."
â¢'By the way," observed a young society
gentleman who was present, "what has
become of the anti-suffragists? Thb Call
gives them an occasional wipe, but no
body else seems to be aware of their ex
istence."
Two Indictments Returned.
The United States Grand Jury returned an
Indictment yesterday against Stephen Zadu,
otherwise known as Stephen Roeaz. for send
ing obscene matter through the malls. Zadu
challenged one Milo to fight a duel on tne
beach, the language employed being of a very
abusive character. A secret indictment was
also returned against "John Doe," who is
charged with sending obscene matter through
the mails to Miss Jennie Ryan, who is em
ployed in the office of Attorney Firebaugh.
Held as Wttnensen.
Four Indians are held prisoners by United
States Marshal Baldwin at the Federal build
ing. They are wanted as witnesses against one
King, whc. it is alleged, hns been unlawfully

With the Lillian Russell Com
pany.
Miss Flora Finlayson, the talented
opera-singer, was found dead in her apart
ments at the Langham Hotel yesterday
morning at about 10 o'clock. The cause
of her death was attributed by the Coroner
Flora I inlayson, the Talented Opera Singer, Who Ded the Day Before Her
First Appearance in This City.
to apoplexy. She has, however, been suf
fering from heart disease for some time.
She was to have played her first night at
the Tivoli last evening in the part of
Azucena in "Ii Trovatore."
Her music teacher and accompanist,
Professor Emilio Cruells, was probably the
last person that saw her alive.
He said yesterday: "I was in her room
in the Langham Hotel yesterday evening
at 7 o'clock sharp, pursuant to an engage
ment, but she told me that she was not
well and begged to be excused from sing
ing her part, asking me to come in the
morning. I came again this morning at
about 10 o'clock and knocked at her door,
but received no answer. Then Mr. Leahy,
the business manager of the Tivoli, came,
and, thinking something was wrong, we
entered the room by a pass-key obtained,
from the proprietor of the hotel.
"We found Miss Finlayson lying on the
floor partially disrobed. She was lying
near tne table of the front room. She
was on her back and was evidently
stricken while in the act of dressing. The
gas was lit in the room at the time. Since
last Friday, when she came to the City, I
noticed that she held a smelling-bottle, I
suppose it was camphor, frequently to her
nostrils.' 1
Manager Gallagher of the Hotel Lang
ham said: "Miss Finlayson came here j
Friday last. Manager Leahy told me to
keep her perfectly quiet. She seemed in
very delicate health and was complaining
all the lime.
"I went up to her room this morning |
to see ii sue wanted some iittle dish, as I
was going to the market. I sent a boy up
before to ask her if she would Jike a
broiled chicken. He knocked, but ob
tained no answer. After Mr. Leahy came
down we, thinking something was wrong,
entered the room and found her lying on
the floor, dead. She had evidently died
suddenly in the night."
Flora Finlayson was born in Canada.
She was one of the best known opera
singers in the country. She went to Reno
with her mother and from there went
to Boston to be educated. Her voice at
tracted so much attention that Mr.
Barnabee of the Bostonian Opera Com
pany engaged her the first time he heard
her. She made a decided hit in that com
pany at once.
She was with tne Bostonians for about
three year?.
Owing to the limited repertoire of that
company she concluded she would have
to strike out for new fields. She accor
dingly went with the Lillian Russell Com
pany and remained with it for two
seasons.
This summer season she took an engage
ment with T. Henry French at the Ameri
can Theater, and her success was pro
nounced in repertoire work. She played in
the great production of "Patience" at the
Herald-square Theater, with Lillian Rus
sell, Hirry Dixie. Joseph Sheehan and
other celebrated artists. She was selected
to play the part of Lady Jane, and took
New York by storm.
When the manager of the Tivoli arrived
in New York she had about made up her
mind to sign a contract with George E.
Lederer, manager of the Casino Theater.
There was, however, some disagreement
over railroad fares, so she concluded to
study at the Tivoli. She thought this
would be of great advantage to her, there
fore she accepted.
She wired her folks to meet her at Reno.
They all met her there and visited with
her only five minutes, this Deing the first
time they had seen her since she had left
for the East.
She arrived here Friday morning and
began her rehearsals with hei teacher,
Professor Cruells, to give her the tempos.
Saturday the Professor went to the Lang-
Dam, but she was feeiing ill. She was
positive, however, that she could take her
part Monday. In the meanwhile, Beat
rice Holmes was engaged to take her part.
Sunday she was to go to the Tivoli to
meet Oebree E. Last for a business re
hearsal, but sent a letter stating she was
sick. Professor Cruells went to the
LanÃham to see her at 4:30 o'clock in the
afternoon. She sang, an i the professor
was in raptures. He said her voice was
divine, and that she would do superbly in
her part. The last time the professor
went has been stated. He found Miss
Finlayson lying dead in the center of her
room.
Miss Finlayson leaves a mother, three
sisters and a brother-in-law, Frank Lee,
cashier of the Bank of Reno.

A SCHEME THAT
SIGNALLY FAILED
The Charge Against Miss
Ollie Wilson Dis
missed.
SCENE IN THE COURT.
Complaining Witness Percy
Douglass in an Intoxicated
Condition.
WOULD NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS
In the Corridor He Attempted to
Strike the Young Womanâ Was
Arrested for Drunkenness.
The case of Olhe Wilson, charged with
grand larceny on the complaint of Percy
Douglass, a saloon-keeper from Bakers
field, was dismissed by Justice of the
Peace Carroll, who presided in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday.
Douglass met Miss Wilson's sister in
Bakersfield and came to this City two
weeks ago. Her parents, who live in
Nelson, B. C, heard that they were here
and her mother, sister and brother came
here to induce the girl to come home.
The were successful, and Monday morn
ing Ollie Wilson and her sister took
passage by the steamer City of Puebla.
Douglass went to the wharf before the
steamer sailed, saw Miss OUie there, and,
with the object of detaining her till he
could get trace of her sister, be called
Policeman Crosby and charged Ollie with
stealing $100 from him. She was arrested,
but was released on her own recognizance
by Judge Joachimsen.
When the case was called before Justice
of the Peace Carroll, Douglass was placed
on the witness-stand, it was at once seen
that he was under the influence of liquor
and was in a fighting humor. He refused
to give a direct answer to any of Prose*
cuting Attorney Mogan's questions and
would only say as a reason for having the
young iady arrested that he wanted to
show her what he could do.
Mogan got angry at him and moved
that the case be dismissed owing to
Douglass' conduct and actions. The
Judge at once dismissed the case and
Mogan advised Attorney Mack, who ap
peared for Miss Wilson, to swear to a
complaint charging Douglass with per
jury.
Miss Wilson left the courtroom with
her brother and Douglass followed them.
The spectators in the court, scenting
trouble, crowded into the corridor.
Douglass made an attempt to strike the
young lady, but her brother interfered.
Douglass then whipped his hand behind
his back evidently for his revolver, but
Detective Anthony had taken the precau
tion to search him before he went into
court.
Douglass was following Miss Wilson
and her Brother and threatening to wipe
the whole Wilson family, Detective
Anthony, the Judge and others off the
face of the earth when Anthony collared
him and took him to the City Prison,
wbere he was booked for drunkenness.
Before Douglass gets out of the prison
the Wilson family will have left for their
home in British Columbia.
Douglass is an ex-convict. He was
raised in this City, and while in the In
dustrial School he attacked the superin
tendent and got 100 days in the County
Jail. Then He went to Kern County and
in 1878 was sentenced to two years in San
Quentin for manslaughter. Later he got
eight years for shooting at a railroad con
ductor. He bears the reputation of being
ready with his gun.
SAYS MILLER IS BOGUS.
J. Li. Franklin Acknowledged That
Captain Lees Was Right.
General E. S. Salomon, attorney for J.
L. Franklin, takes exception to the atti
tude of Frank Miller, the butler recently
arrested in Santa Barbara for seducing a
minor child. According to the general
Franklin ami Captain Lees Agree in con
demning Miller.
General Salomon says that he and Mr.
Franklin are absolutely satisfied that Mil
ler enticed the alleged burglar to the house
and then shot him. Mr. Franklin dis
charged Miller because neither he nor his
family could tolerate his presence. Cap
tain Lees, says General Salomon, urged
Mr. Franklin to keep the man in his house
a little longer in order that the investiga
tion might be more thorough, but Mr.
Franklin found it impossible to meet the
man who he was convinced was a rogue
and discharged him, explaining his motive
to Captain Lees.
General Salomon, aa Mr. Franklin's at
torney, wishes to deny absolutely that the
insinuation that Captain Lees "put the
screws" on Franklin on account of his
connection with a lottery has any truth in
it, and in justice to Captain Lees wishes to
acknowledge that he himself and Mr.
Franklin admitted to Captain Lees that
his theory in regard to Miller's imposture
was absolutely correct.

Rumor Says Dr. Tnbbs Will Issue a
Ukase Against Go its of Eo
ciesiastical M.nd.
It would seem as if the desire for reforma
tion has begun to pervade the goat family.
At least, it doubtless so occurs to the Rev.
Dr. Tubbs of Bethany Congregational
Church.
Just as the reverend gentleman was
about to invoke the divine blessing upon
the services to be held in his chnrch last
Sunday morning, and while the congrega
tion stood with bowed heads ready to re
ceive their pastor's invocation, two mem
bers of the uoat family, commonly classi
fied as "billies," walked soberly up the
oteps that lead to the church door, and
with dignified mien, withal of an aspect
demure, marched sedately down the cen
tral aisle, to the chancel.
Those goats didn't put on any airs at all.
If they had been able to speak they would
certainly have announced themselves as
goats and not as "members of the caprid
family.
Even their knowledge of Clarke's Com
mentaries and Watson's "Apology" was
limited to such information as can be
acquired by a diet of tin cans and leathern
footwear in the neighbors' back yards, but
those who used their eyes declare that
those goats' beards had been freshly
combed for the occasion and they ex
pected to be well treated.
Of course, the Rev. Dr. Tubbs was not
unwilling to give the church-going "bil
lies" instruction in matters temporal, but
lie preferred to do so where no trouble
could arise on account of a mixad congre
gation. So the seekers after reform lore
were gently but firmly led forth from the
house of God. Although they resented
the indignity and seemed to feel deeply
hurt at being deuied the comforting
words of the gospel, they showed their re
gard for the sacred edince and the day,
and departed without any threats of buti
ing the ejectors over on Monday.
Hardly had the sensation caused by the
two goats' arrival died out and the Rev.
Dr. Tubbs begun his sermon when an
other member of the bearded tribe arrived.
This time it was a solitary "nannie."
Whether she came in search of biblical
instruction or the two gentlemen that had
preceded her is a mooted question. Any
way, she made known her sense of loneli
ness at finding herself unprotected among
strangers by a most pitif ui moan, followed
by a mouthful out of a bymnbook on a
near-by seat.
This'evidently satisfied her roving pro
pensities, for as the ushers came lor her to
lead iier out into the green pastures she
showed her utter disregard for the sacred
character of the day and at the same time
a most rowdyish spirit by turning and
running at full speed from the building.
Latest accounts have it that Rev. Dr.

HOW FREE TRADE SERIOUSLY HURTS AGRICULTURE
One of tbe strong points of Bryan's
speech at the Chicago convention was his
appeal to the farmers, who were pictured
as living close to nature's heart "and
mingling their voices with the voices of
the birds."
A careful study of the effect of free
trade on the farmers of the Pacific Coast
and those of the entire Union convinces
one that they will soon have nothing to do
except "to mingle their voices with the
voices of the birds," if the rank free-trade
ideas of Mr. Bryan are given full sweep in
this country. It can be shown that no
class is more worthy of consideration than
the farmer and that farmers have been
sorely distressed by the Wilson bill.
At the outset of the inquiry it should be
remembered that the farming population
is the largest of any in the United States,
which, in spite of the growth of the indus
tries of manufacturing centers, still con
stitutes nearly half of the population.
By tbe census of 1880 the population was
50,000,000, of whom 17,000,000 were en
gaged in business, the others being women,
children, invalids and retired persons. If
the same ratio of employed continues
until today there are probably about
22,000,000 people employed in all voca
tions in America, of whom nearly 10,000,
--000 are engaged in agricultural pursuits.
Agriculture is the basis of all other in
dustries, for no business can exist with
out it. No business in the United State*
is more deserving of protection than agri
culture in its various forms, and none
would suffer more than agriculture under
Bryanlsm at full strength. A glance at
some of the striking provisions of the Mc-
Kinley bill will show how the Republican
policy differed from the rabid let-alone
policy of William Jennings Bryan.
Under the McKinley tariff the farmer

Professional Men Placed Their
Names on the Roll.
ALL TO FiGHT FOR PROTECTION TO
AMERICAN INDUSTRIES.
An Exhibition That Shows That the Peo
ple Have Not Been Deluded as to the
Vital Issues Before the
Country.
The organization of Republican clubs in i
the various Assembly districts last even- I
ing was a revelation to such weak-kneed
Republicans who were afraid that a silver
wave was about to sweep over this coast.
Property-owners, business men, trades
men, shopkeepers, mechanics and laborers
formed the personnel of the crowds which
blockaded the doors of the meeting-places
eager to sign the rolls and enlist in the
battle for protection to American indus
tries.
They had made up their minds that tbe
Democratic party, which within the last
four years had run the Nation $262,000,000
in debt was not a safe party to trust with
tne affairs of state for four years longer,
even though the puppet worked by the
wires of the party manipulators is named j
Bryan instead of Cleveland.
They realized that the great side issue of
eilver coinage was brought forward for the
purpose of throwing dust into the eyes of
the people and of diverting their attention
from the real issue, that of tbe protection
of home industries and tbe redemption of
the labor of this country from its condition
of vassalage to the manufacturers of Great
Britain. Realizing this they were all the
more eager to change this ruinous state of
affairs and to wrest American industries
out of the grasp of the Englishmen and
intrust it to the hands of the American
mechanic and laborer.
So, last night, in all parts of the City,
from where the electric lights shone
against the black background of Sutro's
wooded Dill and to the cliffs overhanging
the foam-crowned breakers, the voters of
the Western Addition, of Richmond and
the other picturesque suburOs in that
Â«ei:hborhood poured into the meeting
places to testify their devotion to Republi
can principles. Others came from tbe
teeming wharves, where they had been
toiling all day in the shadows of the spars,
masts and cordage of the great ships that
come from England with the products of
pauper labor to compete with American
freemen under the approving smile of the
Democracy.
They came from the business streets,
the wholesale houses, the retail stores, the
factories and from tbe crowded alleys of
the town to inscribe their names in pro
test against the enslavement of American
labor by tbe Democracy, and among them
were men who hÂ»d been mined by thÂ«
operation of the Democratic tariff which
reduced a big surplus in the National
treasury to nothing, and piled a new debt
on top of the old to the extent of $262,
--000,000.
These men were there for business, and
they were not silver maniacs or gold ma
niacs, but men of business who desired to
ccc tbe affairs of the country administered
in accordence with business principles.

Twin Pea^s, of Castro, of Sunnyside and

flax, hacKled, $67 20 per ton; hemp,
hackled, $50 per ton ; wool, from 11 to 36
cents per pound, according to quality.
In spite of Bryan's theatrical play that
the tariff is for the rich alone, a glance
will show that the McKinley tariff so
strongly protected the farmer that it
might almost have been called a farmers'
bill.
Senator Dudley wisely expressed the
truth when he said: "Agriculture should
be protected, and there is no country in
the world where it stands more in need of
protection than in the United States. It
the halls upon the gentle slopes that looked
down upon the lights of a great City
twinkling like a Bky of stars reflected in
the sea. And over on the brown dry hills
or Col ma and Ocean View, where Lake
Merced lay sleeping under tne misty
moon, and where big waves sang their
droning song and tripped with white feet
along the shining sands, patriotic citizens
gathered in sturdy protest against Britisn
serfdom with clear eyes unblinded by the
glare of Senator Stewart's silver bullion.
Then along the bay shore, along the
slopes of the San Bruno hills, where the
odor of milk accompanies the lowing of
the gentle cow from the dairies on the
marshes and the green pasture lands,
milkmen and gardeners, farmers and flor
ists, storekeepers and laborers who make
up the population of that picturesque
locality took up the pen with freckled
hands and signed themselves as freemen
demanding protection lor their products
from the competition of the pauper labor
of Kurone and Japan.
They were r.ot quiet gatherings by any
means. They were brimful of patriotism
and enthusiasm. They went not as some
few handsful went tbe night before, like
tbe quarry slave scourged to his dungeon,
but as men nnowued and unbossed. Their
patriotism was not of the pneumatic tire
order, pumped into them by some wily
rogue in the back room of a groggeiy, nor
was it for this campaign only, but for the
next and for all time.
They seemed to be loth to leave the
meeting places, and after signing the roll
they stood on the sidewalks discussing the
political situation, while the postofh'ce line
of voters pressed forward to the tables
where the roll was spread.
There were no disturbances at any o!
the meeting places either from Democrats
or from so-called Republicans working in
tbe interest of the Democracy. A disturb
ance was threatened at Rolando Hall, on
the corner of Twenty-eighth and Church
streets, the meeting place of Club No. 2.
District Thirty-six, when a crowd of a
score of young men visited the hall in the
interest of some disreputable politicians
in the interest of the Democracy and
endeavored to dissuade voters from sign
ing the roll.
But when they saw the kind of voters
who had come to swear fealty to the Re
publican partyâ when they ?aw that they
comprised all the leading men of the dis
trict, they decided that ihey hud been
traveling with the wrong crowd and there
upon turned in and signed tbe roll.
Only a temporary organization of the
twenty-six clubs was attempted lastnieht.
The rolls will be opened for additional
signatures this evening, to-morrow even
ing and Friday evening up to 10 o'cldtk.
At midnight all the clubs were re
ported, and the total enrollment aggre
gates 4000.

THE SAN FKA^CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19, 1896.
should be protected in the products it pro
duces and in the market in which it sells
its surplus products. The latter is quite
as important as the former. If the farmer
cannot sell there is no incentive to produce
more than enough for his own wants; and
if he has no surplus, or cannot sell what
he has, he cannot buy clothing to keep out
the cold or the necessaries of life upon
which he lives. It is the money from his
surplus products that enables him to lire."
It has been shown times without num
ber that the Argentine and Indian wheats
seriously compete with American farmers
and it can readily be shown that the out
look for the future is worse. The lands in
India are as rich and fertile as our own.
How is it possible for our farmers to com
pete with the Indian farmer in raising
wheat when the latter can hire all the
labor he requires at from 6 to 8 cents per
dÂ»y without board, the laborer feeding
himself out of these wages? All the labor
saving machines we have and use do not
and cannot make up for this difference in
the price of labor. In India you can hire
150 men for a day on the interest alone of
the money you pay for your reaper here.
The farmers were protected under tbe
McKinley bill better than ever before in
American history, but even then they
needed more protection. Why? Because
even the protection then offered was not
enough to prevent extensive imports.
During the year ending June 30, 1891, we
imported over $5,000,000 worth of bread
stuffs, $1,185,595 worth of exes, $2,108,891
called the large attendance to order that

man, one of the county committeemen
of that district, asked for order and namel

enrolling committee announced itself
ready for business there was a scramble
by the horny-handed toilers who make up
the voting strength of this section to get
their names on the club's roll. This rush
continued unabated until the roll was

fer this duty until to-night. The organi

Club 1 was called to order by Fred J.
Conn, County Committeeman for that sec

to 8, at Maennerbund Hall, on Thirty

The rules governing the organization

tweeji Fifteenth and Sixteenth avenues,
South San Francisco.
James (lately, the County Committee
man for this section, called the meeting to

chairman of the club originally organized
in South San Francisco, and William
Burke secretary.
President Mi Hugh appointed as an en
rolling committee John Dierks, John
Mau, Charles Ratto, John E. Kostcr and
Robert Stewart.
A motion was offered and carried with

under whose guidance the Republican
party of San Francisco may well feel
proud, and promising to bim tbe allegi
ance as a leader in the coming campaign.
There was a very large attendance pres
ent and over 350 names had been placed
on the rollbook before the hour of ad
journment.
THIBTY-POUBTH DIBTBIOT.
Club No. 1 of the Thirty-fourth District
met for organization in the Mission Turn
Hall, at the corner of Eighteenth and
Lapidge streets. F. J. Hurst was ap
pointed temporary chairman and Del
Bomley secretary.
i The enrolling committee is : J. if. Har
worth of meats and dairy products,
$7,876,374 worth of vegetables and $4,945,365
worth of live animals.
Senator Dudley well inquired when
discussing the question two years ago:
"Why is it necessary to import any agri
cultural products into this country that
our farmers can produce here? The
farmer requires more protection and not
less. With the farming industry, as with
the manufacturing industry, our people
have to contend with the cheap labor of
other countries, and each of these great
industries requires to be protected from
this cheap labor. It has come to this:
We must either lower our wages to the
standard of European labor, which we
cannot and never will consent to do, or
else we must protect it. There is no inter
mediate course or half-way measure that
will meet the difficulty. It is the wages
we pay onr people that marks tne differ
ence between the condition of our laboring
people and those of Europe; that gives to
the one many of the luxuries of life, while
the other does not even have all the neces
saries; enables the one to live, while the
other almost starves."
Continuing in the same unanswerable
line of argument the Senator said:
"The farmer requires a market in which
to sell his surplus products. He builds
the house in which be lives and buys the
clothes he wears, as well as his furniture
and the implements he uses on his farm,
out of his surplus products. Hence his
market should be secure; in other words,
vey, W. Low, C. W. Baker, 1. J. Truman
and Richard Kirby.
Nearly 200 names were signed on the roll.
THIBTY-FIFTH DISTBIOT,

THIBTT-SIXTH DISTBIOT.
Club No. Iâ There was a rousing, enthu
siastic organizing meeting in the Thirty
sixth District in Twin Peaks Hall, at the
corner of Seventeenth and Noe streets.
This comprehended the precincts from one
to eight of the district.
It was one of the most successful open
ings of any club in the City. The best
element of the district was present at the
hall, and before 10 o'clock about 175 had
signed the roll.
The meeting was opened by County
Committeeman Alonzo Davison, who
made a brief address, saying: "This club
is aDout to organize in the interest of
McKinley and Hobart and will be Known
as Republican Club No. 1. I place as tem
porary chairman William C. Johnson."
Mr. Johnson took the chair. He said
that be had been in the district when
there were only 200 votes in it. There
were now more than 5000 votes. "If we
take hold of this issue in the right spirit,"
he said, "we will surely carry our end of
the district Republican. But politics
must nave no sectional basis. It must be
wide enough to carry all religions.
"In this spirit I have no doubt but that
we shall see McKinley as our next Presi
dent."
It is expected that at least 600 names
will be on the roll by next Saturday nitjht,
when the club meets for permanent organ
ization.
The temporary secretary elected was
Alexander rim it b; enrolling committee â
N. E. Mason, G. Troy, D. R. Nagle, Wil
liam Gleason and Albert Merrill.
Judge Van Reynegom said: "I have
talked with many Democrats of this dis
trict and find that a great number be
cause of the silver plank have decided to
come over to tbe Republican party and
have signed here the roll to-night.
"To-night it was perfectly apparent that
there was no cut-and-dried programme.
No bossism was back of it at all."
"The bone and sinew of the Republi
cans of Eureka Valley were with us to
night," said A. Davison. "I am convinced
that we Tiil make a good showing."
Mr. Davison is an old stand-by Republi
can. He has been with the party for
twenty years, and stayed with it, as he says,
through thick and thin.
William C. Johnson, the foreman of the
Union Iron Works, was last campaign on
the State Central Committee and is known
as a stanch Republican.
Ciub 2 of the Thirty-sixth District, com
prising Precincts Nos. 9 to 16, held its

who meant business. More than 200 signed
the roll.
The meeting was called to order by C.
W. Manwaring, chairman of tbe County
Committee. He appointed Lincoln E.
Savage as temDorary chairman and
Charles Daly as secretary. The enrolling
committee was appointed as follows; M.
P. Taylor, Eapene Dasse, George Harris,
J. Currlett and J. H. Moore.
It was resolved that a roll would be
opened at Ocean View on Thursday night

names. The roll will be kept open in Ro
lando's Hall to-nipht, Friday and Satur
day night, when the club, pursuant to the
call of the County Committee, meets for
permanent organization.
Lars Larson was elected as serjeant-at
arms and responded with a neat speech.
"This end of the district," said Mr.
Manwaring, "proposes to stay with the
party and with the County Committee."
The meeting was a great success and
augured well for the Republican prosper
ity of the Bouth end of the Thirty-sixth.

David L. Reynolds, enrolling committee.

H. C. Jones, secretary; Hutrh Frazer,
Harry Piper, Thomas McGee, Louis Usher
and Herman Bohlmann, enrolling com

signed the roll.
FOBTIETH DIBTBIOT.
Club No. Iâ C. D. Pike, chairman ; Frank
Bauer, secretary; W. L. Cole, W. E. Lewis,
E. M. Jacobs, L. Bettman ana Robert
Young, enrolling committee. Eighty
seven signed the roll.
Ciub No. 2â Charles Hobbs, temporary ;
I ha should be as far as possible protected
in his home market.
"The agricultural products of our coun
try, outside of tobacco and cotton, amount
to about $3,000,000,000 per year. Of this
quantity about 92 per cent is consumed at
home and only about 8 per cent is ex
ported. That is to say, the home market
takes 92 per cent and the foreign market
takes only 8 per cent.
'â¢You can thus see the importance of the
home market and the comparative insig
nificance of the foreign market to our
farmers in the consumption of their sur
plus products. It may also be mentioned
that the foreign market is distant, uncer
tain and capricious; dependent upon the
harvest abroad, whether good or bad, and
is always open to the competition of other
nations. Now, the power to buy depends
upon the means the purchaser can com
mand. The wages the laboring man earns
limit his capacity to purchase, and this
applies as well to the purchase of agri
cultural products as to other commodities.
The wages he receives always depend upon
his employment. If he is employed he
earns wages; if he has no employment he
earns no wages."
Indian wheat can to-day be laid down
in Jbonaon at a very low cost. Even with
a reasonable duty added it can be laid
down at New York at a price that inter
feres with the American producer's busi
ness. It is the opinion of those most con
versant with the question that, with the
increased railway facilities under way in
India, before five years tUe Indian farmer
will be able to place his wheat in the New
York market at a figure that will still
further reduce the American producer's
prices.
Back of all else, however, is the fact that
the prosperity of tne farmer depends upon
the prosperity of the buying clans, and
that any free-trade measure that destroys
the home market cripples the farmer. The
free-trade policy of the Democrats, as
championed by Bryan, leaves the preat
agricultural classes at the mercy of the
competition of the serfs of India and the
cheap labor of the Argentine.

tary; R. H. Macpherson, George Lenimon,

bell, said-: : 'You signed a roll at a club
meeting last night."

Oscar Lewis, addressing the chair, said :

ANALYZE WINE,
The Professor's Annual Re
port to the Board
of Health.
SOME TIMELY HINTS.
Eastern Grape Products Have
Once More Fallen Under
Suspicion.
FRUIT THAT IS NOT FRUIT.
Jellies and Jams Manufactured Ont of
Materials That Hive Began
to Decay.
Professor William T. Wenzell, the ana
lytical chemist of the Board of Health,
made a startling suggestion to the board
in his annual report that was banded in at
the Health Office yesterday.
He advocates no less a measure than
the scientific analysis of all wines and
liquors that are sold in the San Francisco
market, on the ground that the large
amount of wine consumed by the public
warrants an investigation as to its purity.
In view of the known fact that the
wines imported from foreign countries are
very often adulterated and with sub
stances deleterious to health, the field of
research will prove interesting and the
wine-drinking public will probably be
educated regarding the constituents of the
liquid it swallows as it never was before.
Professor Wenzell, who occupies a high
position among local chemists, being at
tached in the capacity of instructor in
chemistry to the California College of
Pharmacy and a professor of chemistry
and toxicology to the Cooper Medical Col
lege, believes that the systematic and
scientific analysis of wines, and also of all
liquors, is practicable, and that the sale of
worthless imitations and adulterated
goods can be as easily regulated as that of
milk or impure food. California wine
manufacturers have long advocated this
measure as a safeguard against the foreign
goods they are called upon to compete
with, and thp matter will be taken up by
the board as soon as circumstances permit.
Other portions of the professor's report
are interesting from the fact that tbe re
sults of some of his most recent analyses
of Eastern fruit products are given, throw
ing more light on the manner in which
the public is sometimes burnbuged than
has yet been given.
"I have examined," says Professor
Wenzell, of stuff sold in this
market and supposed to be manufactured
of lemon and pineapple, and rind that, as
a matter of fact, it contains not tbe slight
est particles of the fruits mentioned and
is, moreover, full of materials that are not
calculated to he ben<?nciai to health.
"Other so-called jellies and jams were
plainly manufactured from fruit that had
reached an advanced stage of decay and
the decomposition has made the product
detrimental to health."
The chemist mentions the numerous
analyses of water made during the year
and suggests that with more complete
facilities for carrying on his investigations
far better resnlts could be obtained.
Professor Wenzell's suggestion regard
ing wine analysis will probably be taken
up at the meeting of the board to-day.
BRAVERY'S REWARD.
Gas Fernandez Is Awarded a Medal by
the Children's Society for Sav
ing Two Lives.
The Society for the Prevention o* Cru
elty to Children, at its monthly meeting
held yesterday afternoon, appointed Mrs.
Mary Church special agent of the society
at Fresno. The treasurer reported cash
on hand to the amount of $5439 96, of
which $48 36 was in his custody, $1538 40
on deposit in the Security Savings Bank
and $3853 20 in the San Francisco Savings
Union. I. T. Milliken and B. P. Flint
were appointed to represent the society at
the forthcoming new cnarter convention.
The handsome new medal of the society
was awarded to Gus Fernandez, a deck
hand on the river steamer San Joaqnin,
who saved Mrs. Annie Mitchell and her
little son from drowning some weeks ago.
This is the first award of the newly coined
medal. The announcement of its presen
tation to Fulton Shepard, the young man
who saved an Alameda boy named Willie
Ihirant from death by submersion, was
declared premature, the secretary being
ordered to investigate the case and report
at the next meeting, when the medal will
be swarded to Shepard if it be decided
that he is entitled to it.
Directors Milliken, Flint and Palache
were appointed to prepare resolutions of
respect to the memory of the late General
McComb, former secretary of the society.
MISSION PARLOR.
It Ha* Made Arrangements to Celebrate
in Boyal fashion in Stockton.
At a meeting of the Ninth of September
Committee of Mission Parlor No. 38,;
N. S. G. W., nearly all details were ar
ranged for the coming . celebration at
Stockton, the sub-committees formed hav
ing completed their labors, and the parlor
is now prepared for the coming celebra
tion.
Mission Parlor will take with them a
band of twenty-five pieces. They have
chartered the T. C. Walker, of the Califor
nia Navigation and Improvement Com
pany. The steamer will leave the City for
Stockton, from Washington-street wharf,
on the night of the Btb, after the General
paraue in the City, arriving in Stockton
very early on the morning of the 9th.
Will remain in Stockton all of the 9th,
and will leave for the City of San Fran
cisco about : 1 o'clock on the morning of
the 10th. arriving in San i Francisco in
plenty of time for work.
The parlor having chartered the entire
steamer, will carry some 300 of their mem
bers, their wives and friends, who will be
accommodated with berths, etc. ,
The parlor has arranged to have a min
strel show on board, as well as a very good
quartet, and there i iÂ« T no ; doubt that ) they
will have a jolly good time. â
The parlor has adopted a very neat uni
form for. the members to parade in, and
has also some very- unique features, which
will be displayed during â¢ the parade in
Stockton.
Following are the sub-committees:
Pressâ Aiken, Bert. McCord ; '.; musicâ

STATE EQURLIZERS
ARE CONSIDERATE,
San Francisco Is Accorded
an Extension of
Time.
WILL STAY AT HOME.
The Auditor and Assessor Have
Decided Not to Go to
Sacramento.
COLONEL TAYLOR'S LETTER.
Pertinent Reasons Why the Total Valu
ation of This City's Property Shou'd
Not Be Raised.
The request of the business men and
taxpayers of San Francisco to the State
Board of Equalization for an extension of
time in the matter oÂ£ the assessment for
this City met with a ready response yes
terday, the board telephonine to tbe Mer
chants' Association that September 2, in
stead of to-day, had been tixed as the time
for hearing the matter.
Auditor Broderick and Assessor Siebe
have reconsidered their intention of going
to Sacramento to appear for the City, inas
much as Chairman Taylor of the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
has decided to be present at the meet
ing of the State Equalizers.
Both officials believe that the fact that
the total valuation of City property has
been increased nearly $30,000,000. or nearly
10 per cent, this year will prevent the City
from being raised, and that the letter sent
by Colonel Taylor will be sufficient argu
ment to protect the City's interests.
The letter was as follows:
Clerk's Offtcf Board or Supervisors. 1
Kan Francisco. Aug. 18, 1896. S
Tq the Honorable State Board of Equalization,
Sacramento, CaL â Gentlemen: I have the
honor to acknowledge the receipt of your
notice that it is tbe intention of your honor
able board to increase ihe assessment of all
taxable property in this City and County to
make it conform lo it* true value, and that
objoctions will be heard to Â»&ld proposed in
crease on Wednesday, August 19, 1896.
It does appear that a wrong impression must
exist in the minds of the members of your
honorable board in reference to the assess
ment of property in this City and County, for
the facts are, that property has been assessed
far in excess of its true value, and to such an
extent that in all fairness a reduction on the
tiggreK&te amount ot the assessment should be
considered in lieu of a proposed increase.
Your attention is respectfully called to the
total as-essed value of property in the past
year, 1895-fMJ, which was $327.845, 342, while
this year, 1896-97, after correction of assess
ments on verification by the Auditor, the ag
gregate assessed valuation is $357,586,126, or
an increase of $29,740,784 over the last year,
and this increase over last year is on personal
property $19,437,814 and on real estate $10,
--302,970.
Tne question presents itself as to what is the
cause, especially when it is well known that
during Uie last three or four yeart business has
been greatly depressed, the commercial and
manufacturing interests have steadily suffered
In a loss of trade and real estate has experi
enced snch a decline that the values of prop

erty in this City and County, except on one
street, Market street, have steadily fallen, un
til, at the present time, except in the most
favored localities, but GO per cent of the values
ot property m 1893 or 1894 could be obtained
if a purchaser can be found. This certainly is
no news to the members of your honorable
board. Business houses have been reducing
their stock of goods bo as to conform to the
loss of trade, and many mercantile firms and
manufacturers continue in business, although
expenses are not realized, In hope of a revival
of trade and commerce.
This condition it is hard to acknowledge, but
facts are stubborn and t-annct be gainsaid, and
but for the seeming proposed injustice of still
further increasing the burdens are these facts
brought to your attention.
The City and County of San FranciÃCo shares
in the general progress of the State, and until
a natural advancement is made, this City and
County cannot advance its commercial or
manuiacturing interests, for like a barometer
indicating the weather, San Francisco Indi
cates either the increase or decadence of the
prosperity of the State.
The action of the Assessor in making appli
cation on behalf of himself and the owners of
property for a reduction of 30 per cent on the
assessed valuation of property south of Golden
Gate Park nnd west of First avenue, was the
result of many applications from the owners of
property for a reduction of at least 50 per
cent of the assessed value, and from the fact
that the Assessor based his, opinion through
error on tiie value of this property by deeds
placed on record th:'s year from sales made
years ago on the installment plan, when buy
ers were misled by a so-called real estate boom
to pay fancy prices. The investigation clearly
disclosed that this property was assessed not
less than 50 per cent over and above its actual
cash value, while property in the sand dunes
was assessed at not less than 60 per cent over
and above its actual caÂ«.h value.
This is equally true in degree of assessments
in other portions of this City and County. The
decadence in values has not been considered,
but- sales of years ago have been taken as a
basis of valuation wholly uncalled for and far
in excess of actual values.
The reductions made by the Board of Super
vigors, including $2,583,700 on franchises, ag
gregated $2,972,9! M> > while the reductions on
the application of the Assessor and from
clerical errors aggregated $1,00<>,445, or a to
tal of $3,970,431. It may be pertinent to your
inquiry in this matter to state that, with the
single exception of the reduction made on
franchises, the Assessor recommended after
investigation all the other reductions made.
In presenting the case of San Francisco your
attention is called to the arguments made be
fore your honorable board last year as contain
ing the facts upon which this City and County
looks for relief to your honorable board and to
the well-known decadence in values of realty
and lo the contraction of business, which for
the last few years has been disastrous in its
effects on our merchants, manufacturers and I
business men.
In conclusion, in a mntter of such impor
tance to our taxpayers, as well as in justice to
the taxpayers oi this State, your honorable
board is respectfully requested to consider the |
case of San Francisco without prejudice, for it >
is certainly within your knowledge that the
steady decline of the value of realty in this
City and County should be the means of con
sidering, in place of an increase, what reduc
tion should be made in the aggregate valua
tion.
As many of the members of the Board of i
Supervisors are absent from the City, having
adjourned over for that purpose, ana as no
committee will appear Defore your Honorable
board, the undersigned presents this state
ment as a simple plea for justice at your hands.
C. L. Taylor,
Chairman of the Board of Equalization of the
City and County of San Francisco.
Between now and the time San Francis
co's assessment is to""be taken up the Mer
chants' Association will make a further
showing to the State board why the as
sessment should not be raised.

Sergeant Bidwill, who was on his way to
the City Prison at the time. Tney were

The trouble arose over a bottle of wine,
which Marshall alleges Weiner bought in
his saloon a few nights a^o and did not
pay for. Weiner wa* walking with a lady

Patronage.
PRETENSE OF COMPETITION.
The Contracts Approved by Mayor
Sutro and Acting Mayor
Taylor.
As some doubt was expressed at a re
cent meeting of the Grand Jury as to the
correctness of the statement that the Su
pervisors haa entered into a two years'
contract for lighting the City reference
was yesterday made to the official resolu
tions of award.
Bids were invited for lighting public
buildings, engine-houses, police stations,
public streets and outlying districts. The
I contracts were awarded to the Pacific Gas
Improvement Company, the Edison Light
and Power Company and the San Fran
cisco Gaslight Company. All of the con-
I tracts cover a period of two years. The
show of competition must have been a
mere pretense, which did not deceive any
body. Perhaps no deception was in
tended. All tbe companies supplying
Ilight had practically consolidated or
i pooled their interests before the competi
tion was Invited.
The ugly feature of the business was
the awarding of contracts for two years
without competition. It must have been
known to the Supervisors and to Mayor
Sutro and acting Mayor Taylor that im
provements were being constantly made
in electrical appliances, and that a new
company was preparing to put in a plant
capable of offering bona-iide competition.
The good things of tne contract were
parceled out to three companies in name,
but one company in fact.
For lighting certain public buildings
from May 1, 1886, to April 30, 1898, a con
tract was let to the San Francisco Gaslight
Company. It was approved by C. L. Tay
lar, acting Mayor and ex-officio President
of the Board of Supervisors. The price is
f1 60 per 1000 cubic feet. This contract
calls for the lighting of eighteen engine
houses, seven police station?, three truck
companies and three chemical-engine
houses, and also the fire-alarm station at
Brenham place.
The contract with the Pacific Gas Im
provement Company is two years, from
May 1, 1896, to April' 30, 1898.
It was also approved by C. L. Taylor,
acting Mayor. The price is $1 60 per 1000
cubic feet. The contract calls for the
lighting of twenty engine-houses, four
chemical companies, four truck companies,
the Corporation Yard and Central police
station, New City Hall, County Jail and
Coroner's office.

contract is two years, from August 1, 1896,
to August 1, 18'J8. It was approved Au
gust 3 by Mayor Sntro. This company has
the contract for lighting with electricity
the outlying uistricts. Each light per
nicrht is 55 cents.
The Edison company also gets a share
of the public-building illumination at this
rate: For incandescent electric liebt per
1000 watt hours 11 cents. The company
gets the New City Hall, an engine-house,

The price ia 12 cents for each lamp per
night. This contract was approved by
Mayor Sutro on August 3.
What strikes the Grand Jury as remark
able is the action of the Supervisors in en
tering into a contract for two years. It is
figured that the present Supervisors will
retire from office next January, yet they
have bound the City in contracts extend
ing nineteen months beyond their term
of office.

FRED H. DINGLE
UNDER ARREST,
A Shortage of the Manu
facturers' Assistant
Secretary.
EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGE
The Directors Will Personally
Make Good the Associa
tion's Loss.
OVEE SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
The Defalcation Was a Sad Surprise
to All Who Trusted the
Young Man.
Fred H. Dingle, the assistant secretary
of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association of California, was arrested
last evening on a charge of felonious em
bezzlement for having appropriated to his
own use about $750 of the association's
Fred H. Dingle, the Assistant Secretary of the Manufact nrers' and Producers'
Association. Who Was Arrested for Embezzlement.
funds. He acknowledged that be had be
trayed the confidence of bis employers,
but said that he did not have any idea
that the shortage was over $300.
The board of directors at its meeting
yesterday afternoon, after ordering the
young man into custody, decided to
make good at once to the association every
cent taken by the assistant secretary.
The discovery was made by President
Julian Sonntag, who has only held this
office for three weeks. Soon after taking
his position, Mr. Sonntag began to look
into and familiarize himself with the
affairs of the association, and about a
week ago he telephoned to the treasurer,
A. Sbarboro, for information as to the
amount of money he had on hand. The
information was given, and the next day
he asked Dingle a similar question, and
the amount given by the assistant secre
tary was so small that it excited the
president's attention. Or. the following
day, last Thursday, Dingle turned in
over $100 more, but in the meantime
President Sonntag learned that Dingle
had been making great efforts to secure
the loan of several hundreds of dollars.
This fact caused him to believe thai
there was something decidedly wrong,
and he sent for L. R. Mead, the secretary,
to whom he confided the suspicion that
Assistant Secretary Dingle was short in
his accounts. Mr. Mead was thunder
struck, for he had the greatest confidence
in his assistant's honesty, but the presi
dent and secretary lost no time in begin
ning an investigation. On Friday they
set an expert to work on Dingle's books.
Everything from the time of the organi
sation of the association (March 19, 1895)
up to two months ago was found to be cor
rect. From then $5, $10, $20 and $40 items
were found that could not be accounted
for. Dingle claimed that tnese sums had
been paid out for bills and that tne receipts
had been mislaid. He would hunt for
them, he said. While his search was in
progress he was sail making efforts to
raise $200 among his friends.
On Monday the expert accountant in
formed the Dwsident and secretary that
Dingle's books showed a shortage of about
$700. That settled the case, and late in
the afternoon the two gave Dingle into the
charge of a private detective, as they were
not ready to prefor a charge of embezzle
ment against their employe. Besides
they wanted the full board of directors to
be informed of the entire situation before
taking action. The meeting was held yes
terday afternoon, and all but M. McGlynn
were present. The discovery of tne short
age was explained, and Dingle, who was
still in the charge of the private detective,
was called into the meeting, which was a
secret session, and asked what he had to
say for himself. He had no excuse to
offer, but acknowledged that he was short
in his accounts, and that lie had betrayed
the confidence placed in him. The detec
tive was directed to take the man to the
City Prison and charge him according to
the nature of the crime.
As soon as the door closed .President
Sonntag said : "This is a most unfortunate
affair, but the 800 members of the associa
tion must not suffer nny loss. We are
placed in this position of trust, and we
are responsible not only for our own acts,
but for the acts of those we employ. We
must make good this loss as soon as the
exact amount can be ascertained."
H. J. Crocker, A. McLaughlin, J. P.
Currier, L. R. Mead and several others in
brief speeches deplored what had hap
pened and heariily indorsed the sugces
tion of the president. It was decided to
keep the expert accountant at work on the
books until the full amount of Dingle's
shortage is discovered when that
amount will be placed in the hands of the
treasurer by t!>e board of directors out of
their own pockets.
While the embezzlement of the funds is
peuarded by the directors as a most un
happy affair the association will in no way
suffer, for the prompt action of the board
will settle everything, it is not believed
that the shortage will be more than $750.
The cause of Dingle's downfall is not
known. He is about 35 years of age and
conies from Washington. While in Seattle
he held a positiun of court shorthand
reporter ana he held similar positions in
several large law firms there. He came to
this City with the very best of recom
mendations from Judges and lawyers.
A while after reaching San Francisco he
secured the position of assistant secretary
to the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation, and although his books were ex
amined several times his accounts were
found to be all right until within the last
week.
It was not known that he was given to
drinking, gambling or any of the vices
that usually cause the downfall of young
men who hoid responsible positions.
Some time ago he and his wife were
divorced and he was given the custody of
the boy. While in the association he was
trusted by all and in the absence of
Secretary Mead he had full charge of the
books and the handling of all of the cash
as soon as it was turned in by the collec
tor.

ALONG SEVENTH AVENUE,
Improvements on the South Side
of Golden Gate
Park.
An Offensive Pond of Stagnant Water
Discovered Between the
Sand Hills.
The work of improvement on the out
lying sections of the City is not alone
confined to Richmond and the Potrero.
On the south side of Golden Gate Park
the work is being pushed with a deter
mination that will in the course of a few
years give to the people one of the love
liest drives to be found on tne whole
peninsula. It will be from the park out
by the Almshouse to Ingleside racecourse
and Ocean View road, which leads out to
the Pacific Ocean.
This pleasant roadway starts at I street
where the Olympic building stands, and
continues on Seventh avenue until it
meets the Ingleside road.
In order, however, to make this what it
is intended to be a large amount of grad
ing is beinsi done on that line by Captain
Jonn Tuttle, who has a force of 100 horses
and about 60 men at work removing sand
hills on the line over which this boulevard
will eventually run.
Up to date over 75,000 cubic yards of
sand have been removed from the street
line and on the properties of the Spring
Valley Water Company, Messrs. Sweeney,
Connolley, Hamson and Mayor Sutro.
This shifting of sand hiils leaves the lot
with a frontage of 150 feet on L street, the
property of the City, which is designated
as school property, high and dry.
The work which is now being done in
this section has revealed a nuisance that
calls for immediate action on the part of
the Board of Health. It is a pond of stag
nant wafer, lying hidden between the
sand hills, and containing the sewerage
from the Almshouse, which has been per
mitted to remain there for years through
either an oversight or gross carelessness
on the part of some one who should know
where this refuse has been permitted to
lodEje.
This offensive collection of tilth has re
mained so long that a dirty green scum
an inch in thickness has settled on its
surface. This scum is occasionally dis
turbed by boys from the City, who, hav
ing discovered it, go in swimming in its
offensive waters.
Some years ago Thomas TJ. Sweeney in
voked the aid of the law an J caused a con
tinuation of the Almshouse sewer to be
run as far as Twentieth avenue, but tne
old. sewer, which still empties into this of
fensive pond, remains open, thus permit
ting the overflow to lodge there as a men
ace to public health, not only of the
residents, but of the people who traverse
the boulevard mentioned.
On the line of this improvement the
Spring Valley Water Company is getting
ready to put down an eight-inch sewer
pipe which will connect with Lake Honda,
thus giving a much greater supply of !
water to the park, as also >o the residents !
of the Richmond and adjoining districts. I

lights on the reasons why so many steam
ers have gone ashore and been lost of late.
Rex was discharged from the steamer at
San Bias, Mexico, and sent back to San
Francisco on the company's steamer
Colon after having been kept in irons for
some time, his sole offense consisting in
having changed the course of the vessel
on the night of April 24 last when he
thought she was in danger of running
ashore. He sued for $299 damages for the
treatment he received at the hands of Cap
tain Russell and the other officers of the
City of Para.
The plaintiff on the stand told a
straightforward story of the incidents of
the trip that evidently impressed the
J u-tt ice.
He said that on the night of the 24th of
April, while he was in command after
leaving Mazatlan, and when about abreast
of Isabel Island, he discovered that the
course that the ship was sailing would
bring her up against Piedra Blanca
Island, which lay directly in her course.
Not being sure of the distance from the
island, and not liking the appearance of
the main land, which looked dangerously
near, he sent for the first officer to con
sult with him. Two calls failed to bring
his superior on deck and, believing that
all on board were in danger, he changed
the course of the vessel half a point so as
to carry her clear of the island. The
change of course was slight and would not
necessitate an appreciable loss of time.
For this he was discharged, placed !
in Irons and compelled to" return to
San Francisco on the steamer Colon
against his wishes. He testified that he
had been following the sea for forty years
and had served as the master of a large
number of vessels as well as first and sec
ond officer of many more.
S. N. Nelson, the first officer of the snip,
admitted when called to the stand that j
the ship had been headed by his orders j
directly for Piedra Blanca Island, but
claimed that there was plenty of time to
change her course and that he would have
done so at 6 o'clock that morning had not
Rex taken it upon himself to do so.
On cross-examination Attorney Hut
ton's questions contained an inference
that the officers of tne 3hip were angry be
cause the change of course had necessi
tated a slight loss of time and an increased
consumption of coal, bn* this was denied
by the witness, who claimed that Rex
should have obeyed his orders, no matter
what they were.
Officer Nelson admitted that the quarter
master, sent by Rex, might have called
him and he not hear, as he was asleep on
a couch in his room. He claimed that
Rex had ouce before changed the course
of tne ship without orders, though assert
ing that the captain had ordered him to
instruct the second mate, who was on the
bridge, to that effect.
The matter was taken under advisement
by Justice Groezinger.
SHAVED IN HIS CELL.

Attorney Bell of counsel for Oliver Win

before Superior Judge Wallace yesterday
morning and withdrew the motion he
made last Friday to dismiss the indict
ments found by the Grand Jury charging
Winthrop with robbery and assault to

The members of the Grand Jury who

signed the indictments had all been sum
moned by Assistant District Attorney
Black and were prepared to answer as to
their qualifications to act as Grand Jurors.
Their presence being waived, Wiuthrop
entered a plea of not guilty in each case.
The defense desired a week or more in
which to cet ready for trial, Dut Judge
Wallace placed *;he cases on the calendar
for to-morrow morning.
The discovery was made yesterday
morning that Winthrop had shaved him
self during the night. Captain Robinson
searched the cell for a razor, but could not
find one. Winthrop said he had shaved
himself with a broken piece of glass, but
neither Captain kobinson nor Captain
Lees believes him. They think some friend
gave him a razor, which be managed to
conceal.
Captain Lees would prefer that Win
throi> would allow his mustache to grow,
but Winthrop is determined, if possible,
not to oblige him.
SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY.
The Police Condemned for Interfering
With Public Speakers.
The State Executive Committee of the
Socialist Labor party met Monday night
in the Turk-street Temple. G. B. Benham
presided. Among those present were:
H. F. Sahlender, Edel Hecht, Emil Leess,
Leo Gasser and Theodore Lynch.
After receiving reports from the various
sections and branches throughout the
State touching the progress of the cam
paign the committee discussed the matter
of issuing a manifesto for distribution in
the coming campaign. A lengthy docu
ment was submitted, which will come up
for final adoption next Monday night.
It will be issued under the direction of
the State executive in the form of a four
page paper, and will contain much valua
ble information touching the growth and
progress of the party, and will be judi
ciously distributed during the campaign.
The Socialist executive is watching closely
lor mistakes by the old party orators.
G. B. Benhara and Theodore Lynch
were appointed a challenging committee
to refute and challenge any old party
orator whose economic errors or mis
statements permit of a public debate. The
committee strongly condemned the police
interference with the rights of free speech
and free public discussion, and unani
mously decided to attend in a body the
mass-meeting at the Metropolitan Temple
this evening. The secretary reported
favorably from parties who received peti
tions, and the returns on hand indicate
large gains in the strength of the party
throughout the State.
SOME NEW ATTRACTIONS
Manager Bouvier Tells of the
Talent He Will
Have.
Alexander Salvini to Appear in
New and Romantic
Plays
Manager Al Bouvier of the Baldwin
rheaterhas returned here after several
weeks' absence in the East While absent
Mr. Bouvier made arrangements for the
ippearance of a large number of first-class
ittractions at the Baldwin and California
theaters for the ensuing season.
He also interested himself a good deal
in studying the present political situation.
He met Mr. Hanna and had quite a talk
with him. Mr. Bouvier says Mr. Hanna
impressed him as an exceedingly able
man, and he thinks there will be no doubt
about McKinley's success. In Mr.
Bouvier's opinion the fight will be won by
in overwhelming majority.
In the theatrical line New York is very
lull. There were almost no attractions
on the boards when Mr. Bouvier was
there. In regard to the attractions here,
Mr. Bouvier says that the first thing after
the "Gay Parisians" and "Madame Sans
Gene" will be the "Prisoner of Zenda."
It will be the first presentation of this
play here, and is expected to cause little
less than a sensation. Mr. Hackett will
be in the title role, and there will be
throughout the same cast as at the
Lyceum Theater. Mr. Hackett makes an
ideal hero for the fitness of the role.
Mr. Bcuvier gave details of other attrac
tions to come, saying:
"We are also to have at the Baldwin
Alexander Salvini in a series of romantic
plays and Julia Marlowe in several of her
latest productions. Delia Fox will play a
two weeks' engagement at the Baldwin,
appearing in her recent successes with a
full company, numbering over eighty
people.
"Nat Goodwin will play during Tnanks
giving week, and for the holiday attraction
we have one of the strongest ever offered,
viz. Palmer Cox's 'Brownies.'
"One of the most important engage
ments of the year will be the three weeks'
season of Manleson's Opera Company.
Italian and French opera will comprise
mot of the repertoire.
"We are also to have Louis James in two
new produciions, Robert Hilliard in
"Lost," a most delightful comedy which
has just been accepted in London; "Shore
Acres," with James A. Hearne in one of
the leading roles, is one of the strong
plays of the season; and Fanny Daven
port.Otis Skinner and Mme.Modjeska will
also be seen at the Baldwin. There are on
foot negotiations toward Beerbohm Tree
and John Hare, the latter of whom, 1 feel
certain, will come to California for a brief
eneagement.
"While all the above is taking place at
the Baldwin, the California will be keep
ing its end up in good shape. Steve
Brodie, in his character play, 'On the
Bowery,' will be followed by 'Darkest
Russia.' 'Sowing the Wind,' 'The Black
Sheep,' 'The Old Homestead,' etc., are
also on the list One of our big engage
ments, we think, will be Wilton Lackaye,
supported by his own company in two or
three new and strong plays. 'Fair Vir
ginia' and Maggie Cline in her latest suc
cess, 'Broadway,' will be seen at the Cali
fornia.
â¢'We intend producing on an elaborate
scale such plays as 'Shenandoab,' 'Held
by the Enemy,' 'The Sporting Duchess,'
'The Fatal Card,' etc., all of them suc
cessful plays and some entirely new to
the coast.
"I have looked over the list of attrac
tions printed by the theaters in the East
outside of New York City, and I cannot
but insist that San Francisco will fare
better than any city in the Union outside
of the metropolis. The best that can be
had will be brought here, and we only
hope that the election excitement will
leave the people a little time for amuse
ment."
NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS.
Two Structured Decided On by the
Board of Education Yesterday.
The Board of Education at a special
meeting held yesterday decided to accept
a building lot offered by Mrs. Mary 8.
Burnett on the San Bruno road, and erect
a one- room school house on the property
at a cost of about $250. A similar building
will be erected on Sixth avenue, between
B and C streets, E. S. Slack haying volun
teered to put up the structure if the board
will furnish the materials.
MISS MINNIE WAACKHUSEN.
A GREAT DRAMA CLOSED,
Injunction Against the A. R. U.
Strikers Finally With
drawn.
An Action Which Was Authorized by
the Attorney-General of the
United States.
The last act in the great drama in which
two years ago the members of the Ameri
can Railway Union in Alameda County
and the National Guard of California
played important parts came to a con
clusion in the United States Circuit Court
in this City yesterday afternoon. While
the fall of the curtain on the local portion
of the long drawn out struggle was not
accompanied by any striking scene, the
event of yesterday was not without sig
nificance and interest, because the only
suit Ftill outstanding was formally with
drawn.
All the criminal suits were disposed of
some time ago, but there still hung over
the head of Thomas J. Roberts and, pre
sumptively, Eugene V. Debs and other
officers and members of the A. R. U.
who took an active and prominent
part in the great strike and tie-up, an in
junction which forbade them to interf re
in any way with railroad trains which
carried the mails of the United States, etc.
This was only a temporary injunction,
but it has jossessed sufficient vitality to
survive, in a soit of moribund condition
ever since the summer of 1894, when the
strike was in actual and daily progress.
Thomas J. Roberta was at the time of
the strike the president of the Oakland
branch of the American Railway Union,
and as such headed the movement in Ala
meda County. The injunction was made
to read aeainst Eugene F. Debs, Thomas
J. Roberts et al., but as a matter of fact
service was never made on any person
other than Roberts. Injunctions which
were issued by the United States courts in
other parts of the country were also
directed against Debs, so that there was
no necessity for service upon him in the
temporary injunction issued here. The
suit was instituted at the instance and
upon the order of Attorney -General Oluey.
It was begun while Charles A. Garter was
United States District Attorney.
When United States District Attorney
Foote came into office, succeeding Mr.
Garter, he filed replication to the answer of
the defendants, thus making up the
record, but the case has never gone any
further, reposing quietly for many months
in the calendar of the United States Cir
cuit Court.
Some time ago Mr. Foote wrote to the
United States Attorney-General in refer
ence to this matter. He says that he has
not entertained any intention to push the
proceedings, and he so infoimed Mr. Rob
erts when the latter called upon him to
make inquiries abont the status of the
case some two or three months ago.
In writing to the Attorney-General Mr.
Foote suggested the advisability of with
drawing the injunction from the calendar
where, under all tne circumstances, it
could serve no useful purpose. The At
torney-General has apparently taken the
same view of the suit. A letter was
received from him by Mr. Foote yesterday
afternoon. Just before the adjournmentof
the United States Circuit Court Mr. Foote
made the motion to dismiss the order and
this was promptly granted, so that all the
A. R. U. litigation here on account of the
strike of 1 ; 894. bearing upon the strikers, is
now formally withdrawn or dismissed.

DIED BECAUSE SHE
DEARLY LOVED HIM
Minnie Waackhusen Turns
On the Gas and Goes
to Sleep.
HER HEART WAS BROKEN
Months Ago She Expected to Be
the Wife of H. F.
Lilkendey.
SHE WAS CRUELLY JiLTED.
The Young Man Clams That His
Mother Said He Was Entirely Tco
Yoong to T?ke a Wife.
Minnie Waackhusen, a rather prepos
sessing young woman 22 years of age, was
self-asphyxiated Monday night at 892
Fourteenth street, in the home of her
brother-in-law, J. Stelling.
The girl had been out walking with Miss
Beutfield, a friend and companion living
H. F. lILKENDEY.
on Henry street, a block or so away from
her own home, and when ooth reached
the Steliing home Miss Minnie refused to
have her friend spend the balance of the
night with her.
When Miss Bentfield departed, Miss
Waackhnsen disrobed and, after turning
on the gas jets in the room, she lay on
the bed to die.
Peter 8 tell ing, a brother of J. Stelling,
was the only one in the house and it was
not until early yesterday morning that he
detected the odor of gas emanating from
the girl's room. He rapped at the door,
and obtaining no response broke it in and
found the girl dead.
Minnie Waackhusen came to this conn
try eight years ago from Germany with
her two sisters, Mrs. Bullwinkel and Mrs.
Btelling. She made her home with
the latter, and when J. Stelling and his
wife left for a trip to Germany last April
they left the girl to take charge of their
home and care for Peter Stelling.
These are the plain facts of the suicide,
and behind them is the story of a broKon
heart, to relieve the pain of which poor
Minnie Waackhusen saw no way but
death.
Sha was very much in love with H. F.
Li lkendey, a grocer's clerk in the employ
of Cluff Bros. They met some four years
ago and both were smitten. They were
engaged to be married, but the ceremony
never took place.
Miss Bentfield, the last person to see
Minnie alive, told the following regarding
their meeting Monday night:
"Minnie and I wept outwalking. She
was very sad and 1 could not cheer her
up. She cried nearly all the time and
said she did not see why she should care
to live. She spoke of Mr. Lilkendey and
said how much she loved him, but that
he bad broken her heart and did not care
for her any longer.
"Suicide was her hobby. She spoke of
it all the time as being the right thing in
cases of her sort. No matter bow hard 1
tried to change the subject, she would
always come back to the same subject.
"When we reached ber house I asked
her if it would not be better for me to stay
all night with her as I had frequently
done before, but she said she wished to be
alone.
"As I bade her good-night she kissed
me over and over again. This was rather
unusual with her.
" 'Will you ieel sorry for me if anything
wrong happens ; will you cry?' she asked
me. I told ncr I would, and she seemed
pleased, saying she was glad somebody
cared for her.
"As I was about to leave the house she
kissed me again and said, 'Come around
in the morning.' I told her I would, and
added that I would see her and she would
be well and not so nervous by that time.
Her answer, given in a tearful way, was:
'I don't know whether you will see me
again.' "
Mrs. Bullwinkel, a sister of Minnie, was
greatly downcast when she was seen yes
terday beside the casket of ber dead one.
She could say but little, but that little
was very Ditter as she spoke, of H. F.
Lilkendey.
"It is all his fault," she declared. "He
was to have married my sister in March
last, prior to the departure of Mr. and Mrs.
Stelling for Germany. He did not do so,
and his refusal broke her heart.
"The first engagement of marriage they
had made called for a wedding about last
Christmas-time, and he broke that off.
When they ceased seeing each other, some
months ago, Minnie wrote to him repeat
edly asking him to come back to her. He
either sent the letters back or else an
swered her that their engagement was off,
and that marriage was out of the ques
tion."
The young man in question was seen
yesterday afternoon at Cluff Bros.' store
on Front street.
"I did not know Minnie would be foolish
enough to do such a thing," he said when
notified of the suicide.
"We had separated forever, and in one
of her letters to me she stated that no hap
piness could come of our marriage.
"1 met her first, ac a ball over fonr years
ago, a friend of mine escorting her iady
friend home, while I paid attention to her.
Subsequently I was gratified and flattered
when my gentleman friend informed me
that he had learned through his friend
that Miss Waackhusen thought well of
me.
"Our acquaintance lasted a long time
and ripened into love. My mother learned
of my attachment and objected to it be
cause I was only 18 years oi age and Min
nie was but two months my junior.
"Then again, Minnie and I did not
agree. I never could do anything she
thought was right. Our last quarrel was
when I wanted to attend the marriage of
a friend of mine in a Native Sons' lodge.
She denied me that priviieee unless she
went with me. I could not take her, aa
she was not invited, but I promised her I
would not go. I made this promise in
tending to break it, as she was standing
outside her home declaring she would not
go in unless I did as she wanted.
"She learned of my being at the wed
ding and then wrote to me breaking off
our engagement
"She returned me the diamond ring I
had sent her. and I sent back the presents
she had made me.
'â¢I have resisted her appeals for a recon
ciliation all these days because I firmly
believed we never could be happy in mar
ried life.
"I have loved that girl erer since our
first meeting, and nothing can i xpress the
sorrow I feel that she has died by her own
hand."
SAYS HE IS PERSECUTED.
A Foreigner Who Wants to Leave the
Country and Bolt His Ball.
Judge Daingerneld received a strange
letter yesterday which he has decided to
turn over to Judge Joachimsen and to the
District Attorney for investigation.
"On the evening of the 20th of July,"
said he last night, "in the height of the
season for applications for naturalization,
a crowd of 150 foreigners appeared in my
courtroom and each man had with him
two witnesses. One of the applicants was
a certain Francis Nicoloni Hagen, a na
tive of Denmark, a ship's engineer or some
thing of that sort. The other day he was
arrested on a complaint filed for alleged
perjury in naturalization. He gave bail
ior $500 and was to appear in Judge Joacn
imsen's court next Thursday. Now ho
writes to me saying that he is an inno
cent man, out is being persecuted, and he
wants to know if it would be all right if
he shouid leave the country, for he in
tends to forfeit his bail. I have not an
swered his letter. I have decided to brint?
it to the attention of Judge Joachimsen
to see what he purposes to do about the
matter."
The Divorce Courts.
Judge Daingerfleld yesterday divorced Frank
P. Flesh from Anna B. Flesh because of
willful desertion.
Annie M. Whitney was legally separated
from Abbott Lawrence Whitney because of the
latter's extreme cruelty.
Judge Sanderson granted George H. Garesche
a divorce from Hannah Oarescne because of
the latter's infidelity.
Rosetta Sedgley's Estate.
The will or Rosetta A. Sedgley, widow of

Why Medicine Fails.
Drugs are like whisky, only a temporary

up for short lime and deserts them finally,
leaving them worse than before taking. Thif
is true of all drugs used to renew vitality. It
does not renew strength because there is no
element in medicine to restore the power ta
the nerves, upon which all vital organs live.

HER EMBARRASSING LETTERS.
It Was Decided to Be Bast That She
Should Ba With
drawn.
Mrs. Flavilia H. Todd, tbe widow of the
late Alexander H. Todd, a white-haired
old lady, yesterday added a new toucn of
interest to the Fair will case.
Mrs, Alexander Todd, the New Witness in the Fair Will Case.
She was dressed in widow's weeds, but
her manner was, during the morning ses
sion, altogether blithe and cheerful. She
answered ail questions frankly, Laving
occasionally, however, to consult with her
friends by way of refreshing her memory.
Mrs. Todd stated that she had lived in
California over forty years (with a little
laugh); that she had married Alexander
ri. Todd in 18o5; that her husband died
in 1890. Todd established tbe first ex
press, sbe said, in California, but sold it
out about six months before their mar
riage and afterward engaged in tbe grain
business. Then, coming to tne point of
interest, in answer to questions put by
Mr. Delmas, tne witness testified:
"I knew Senator Fair from seventeen to
twenty years before his death; he fre
quently visited our house : ha was a great
friend of my husband's; we were on quite
friendly terms. About a week before
tbe Senator's death I had a conversa
tion with him at the Lick House. I was
in the parlor visiting some folkd. As I
came out of the parlor I met the Senator.
I He said he was a very sick man, and that
he did not think ho would iive a week. 1 j
rather joked him about it.as he was always
taking about dying, I told himlthou ht
he would outlive me many years. He said
no, he was very sick. He also said he had
made his last will. I laujrhea and told
him he had said the same thing tbe last
time I saw him. Indeed, he was always
talking about his will, and had made
about a hundred. But he insisted that he
Had now made his last will; that he had
written it in the room of a lady friend, a
schoolteacher, and had left it with her,
and that it was in good hands. I told him
that I did not think that was fair; that if
he was going to leave it with a lady he
ouaht to have left it with me, as I was the j
most intimate lady friend he had.
"He said, 'Well, I made the will in htr i
room and left it with her.' He also said
that he had fooled or the will would fool
the other fellows, or something to that
import. , ...
"Shortly after tbe death of his son
James,' ; continued the witness in answer
to questions, "the Senator told me he had
made a will in which he left me in com
fortable circumstances;. 1 don't suppose I
need tell how much he said he left me.'
"Were you at tbe bedside of young Fair
when he died?" asked Mr. De'mas.
"I was. I was stopping at the Lick
House. My room was next to that of
young Jimmy. I was awakened by the
sounds of groaning. I ;was in my night- 1
dress, but I went into the hall. The sound
seemed to come from Jimmy's room and
seemed like that of a man in a drunken
stupor. I went into the room and found
Jimmy almost unconscious. He beckoned
me to come to him. I ran to him crying,
'â Why. Jimmy, what is thÂ« matter?' I
then" ran to Senator Fair's room and called
him. The Senator hurried to his son's
side, but rfothing could be done for him.
He died shortly after."
Mr. Delmas turnbd the witness over to
Attorney Pierson, who immediately began
to-quostion her upon her personal rela
tions with Senator Fair. In answer to his
questions the witness stated that she fre
quently staid for periods of two or three
nights at a time at the Lick House; her
room was not always the same, but she
generally cccuoied the room adjoining
that of tbe Senator.
"Did you correspond with Senator Fair
after your husband's death?" asked Pier
son.
'â¢Oh, yes, frequently."
"Do you recall having placed letters
under his door?"
"I did do that."
"Did you make engagements with the
Senator at night?"
"Did you ever make appointments to
meet him at night?"
"He made appointments with me to
take me to the theater several times."
"Did you ever make appointments with
him, notifying him of what room you
would occupy in the Lick House!"
"He would ask me to go to the theater,
and I would go and stop at the Lick House
and leave a note under his door advising
him of what room 1 had that he might
call for me."
"Was this on one occasion?"
"It may have been several occasions."
"You say you had a long acquaintance
with Senator Fair previous to your hus
band's death?"
"Yes. sir."
A letter with a black lined envelope and
paper addressed to Senator Fair and dated
June 8, 1890, was shown witness and
identified by her as in her handwriting.
Ttse letter began: "You will pardon me,
Senator Fair, for addressing you, a perfect
stranger." She was asked why she should
have written so to an old friend.
"You can understand," she answered,
"how a person would write so. Of course,
I had very little conversation 1 with Mr.
Fair previous to my husband's death."
She said she saw Senator Fair within a
day or so after this letter.
The witness said tDat while the son
James was lying dead, or shortly after his
burial, the Senator told her that he had
changed his will or mode a new will, leav
ing Her in comfortable * circumstances;
that he had bequeathed her $100,000. The
witness saw Senator Fair for the last time
when he was on his deathbed. 7
"Was that by appointment or other
wise?" asked Pierson. T. â¢;. .".â¢â â¢.
"By appointment. .The Senator wrote
me a note, asking me to call. Iwr.s there
but' a Jew minutes. He . did ' not iiave
much to say. Dr. Levingston was there,
and a nurse.!', ,
Then Mr. Pierson presented the second
of a stack of letters to Mrs. Todd. She
read it through and admitted that it was
written by her to Mr. Fair. It invited
the Senator to call on her, and was of
such a character. that, after a short con
sultation between the lawyers, it was deÂ«
cided not to offer it in evidence. -."/'â¢'
V" A recess wa3, taken at this juncture.
Mrs. Todd appeared,; evidently suffering
under a severe nervous tension. Her com
panion was all attention, offering water,
exercising a fan and administering a pow

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19, 1896.
MONTEITH NAILS
HIS COLORS FAST
He Will Not Withdraw to
Please the Southern
Pacific.
DEMOCRATS IN A FICKLE
They Dare Not Disobey the Rail
road Company and Support
Its Opponent
TWO COMMITTEES TO CONFER
The Sausalito Man Disliked Because
He Tried to Gst C. P. Hunt
ington Arrested.
George W. Monteith, candidate of the
People's party for Congressman from the
First District, is on the war trail, and the
Democracy, riding on the cowcatcher of
the Southern Pacific Company, is pursu
ing him.
The Southern Pacific people do not like
Mr. Monteith. He it was who defended
the railroad strikers and said many harsh
things about that corporation. He it was
who attempted to procure the arrest of
Collis P. Huntington on tbe charge of
having issued a pass to Frank M. Stone,
political manager for M. H. de Young of
the Chronicle. Hence the Southern Pa
cific, which owns tbe Democratic party of
this State, has issued its edict that the
Democracy must not fuse with the Popu-
lists of the First Congressional District
unless the Populists consent to kick Mr.
Monteitti off tne ticket.
Mr. Monteith defies the Democracy and
its owner, the railroad company, and
swears that he has nailed his colors to the
mast mid will not come down. Tbe
People's party State Central Committee
has not the power to take him off tbe
ticket.
A conference committee has been ap
pointed by the Democratic Congressional
committee of tbe district to confer with a
like committee appointed by the Populists,
but as tbe railroad company will not allow
the Democracy to indorse any man not
friendly to the company tbe conference is
not expected to be of any avail.
Chairman E. M. "Wardall of the People's
party State Central Committee said yes
terday that the conference committee
would meetjn a few days.
"I Kuess mr. Monteith is not acceptable
to the railroad company," be added.
"They say bitter things against Monteith.
The Democrats say that they will indorse
anybody but Monteith. But he will not
draw out, and this committee cannot force
him to withdraw. The Democrats have
not met the People's party in the right
spirit in the matter of fusion. Tney nom
inated Kelly in the Fifth Congressional
District and they put up a man of their
own in McGlashan's district, and they are
now trying to nominate a man in Los
Angeles in the Bixth District."
When Mr. Wardall was asked as to the
probability of fusion on ihe electoral ticket
be replied that a union would be bad, be
expected, on the basis of four People's
party electors for Bryan and Watson and
five Democratic electors for Bryan and
Bewail. A meeting of the Populists' State
Central Committee has been called for
next Saturday, at which meeting some
definite pUn of action will be formulated.
"Bryan and Watson would be tbe
Btronger ticKet before the people," re
marked Mr. Wardall. "It wou~d be a
much stronger combination in the South,
and it is in the South and West that we
must make our tight."
Mr. Wardall added that one of the dis
agreeable effects of the inauguration of
the free coinage of silver would be the
foreclosure of land mortgages now held by
the banks. The purchasing power of the
dollar would decrease, and land, there
fore, would become more valuable. Hence,
the banks would take it in.
Solid for McKinley.
Lettera are coming into the office of the
Republican State Central Committee
â¢very day giving encouraging accounts of
the campaign in the interior. R. A. Bar
stow, chairman of the Republican central
Committee of Fresno County, says:
"From a careful observation the politi
cal situation grows brighter every day.
Many of the weak-kneed are now falling
into line and a good many Democrats
have announced themselves for McKinley.
As to the Populists, they don't know
where they are at."
From the St. Louis Obispo County Cen
tral Committee comes the news that Mc-
Kinley and Hobart clubs are being formed
in every part of the county. The club in
San Luis Obispo city has 250 members, the
Arroyo Grande club has over 100 members,
and others are being organized rapidly in
all oarts of the county.
THE LABOR UNIONS.
Arrests of Socialists Condemned by the
Cigar-Makers.
The Cigar-makers' Union met last even
ing, and the subject of the recent arrest
of socialists came up for discussion. The
sentiment of the cigar-makers was crys
talized in the following resolution:
Whereas, The right of tree speech and
peaceful assemblage has again been assailed
by the police of San Francisco; and whereas, a
jury has been secured who will convict men
for exercising the right of American citizens;
and whereas, the only possible hope of the
people to solve all questions that may arise
lies in the untrftmmeled exercise of the right
01 free speech; therefore be it
Retolved, That we, the clgar-makers (No. 228)
of San Francisco, unequivocally denounce the
usurpation of power by the authorities aa dan
gerous to the best interests of society and a
menace to our free institutions.
All the carpenters' and joiners' unions
have now withdrawn their delegates from
the Building Trades Council and are con
ducting their business more to their pleas
ure. 'At the time the first two unions left
the council the district council of the car
penters selected a business agent. Now
that all are out it has been decided to
hold a mass-meeting of the craft and
elect a business agent. The mass-meeting
will be held on Friday evening in ode of
the large halls in Odd Fellows' building.
Other important business will come up
for consideration.
Carpenters' Union No. 304 is preparing
for its ninth annual entertainment
and ball, which will be held at 115 Turk
street on next Saturday evening.
DICK WILLIAMS' DIVORCE
Charges of Awful Cruelty Are
Brought by the Ex-Inspec
tor's Wife.
Nine Years of Domestic Infelicity,
in Which Threats to Kill
Were Common.
The story of tbe domestic infelicities of
Richard S. Williams, the ex-customs in
spector, and his wife, is being unfolded in
Judge Hunt's court. If the tale told by
Mrs. Williams be but half true, her hus
band should be either in jail or in a luna
tic asylum. Her testimony yesterday was
one long recital of cruelty. Four days
after her marriage, she said, her husband
tore her wedding dress from her person
and on tbe day she left him be tried to kill
her with a carving-knife. During the in
tervening nine years Williams ran the
gamut of every conceivable cruelty
known to a brutal husband.
While tbe story of bis shortcomings was
being recited the ex-employe of Uncle Sam
sai at a table with his attorney and
scowled. He is apparently little interested
in the fact that his wife is trying to free
herself from him. What interests Wil
liams is $3000 that is in the hands of tbe
court pending the decision of the suit.
ThiÂ» money is community property and
he wants half of it. On the other hand
Mrs. Williams wants it all. She claims
that her husband made away with over
$5000 that remained in their home at 422
Scott street on the day of their separation.
The story of Williams' cruelty as related
on the witness-stand yesterday is almost
incredible. It was related how he tore off
his wife's wedding oress because she vis
ited her mother; how he slapped her face
with a hair brush ; bow he struck her with
his fist and blackened her eyes; bow,
when sbe was sick in bed, he threw pil
lows at her and afterward threw her down
stairs; how be threw plates at her, at
tacked her with a razor and threw a plate
of food in her face. Williams also occa
sionally amused himself by dragging hi s
wife from bed late at night and forcing
her to do kitchen-work, and at other
times made her do housework over again
because it was not done to suit him.
About a year ago. tired of harsh treat
ment, tbe abused woman left her home
and returned to her mother. She was
enticed back by a message that one of her
children was sick and locked in a room by
her husband, who beat and kicked her to
his heart's content. A month later he
threw a ham at her, beat her with a poker
and struck her on the side of the head and
injured her so severely that lier Â£earing
has ever since been impaired.
The culmination of the entire trouble
occured on April 29 last. Oa that day
Williams thrashed his wife with an um
brella, and when she threatened to leave
him, tried to kill her with a carving-knife.
She escaped through a window, after
cutting her hands severely in securing the
knife. Williams than tore up all her
dresses, and she sued him for divorce.
Williams in his answer alleges that his
wife treated him with cruelty, and that
she recently tried to shoot him.
Benjamin Healy, A. J. Green, Mrs. E. M.
McCloskey Mrs. Mary Moore, E. W.
Hyde and Mrs. E. G. Runge testified yes
terday for tbe plaintiff. The case goes on
to-day. _â¢
MYTHICAL HORSE RACE.
Warrant Out for tlie Arregt of Charles
Waiigerman, Butcher, for Grand
Larceny.
Peter Feturier, proprietor of the City
Hall Laundry, 423*4 Turk, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Joachimsen'g court yes
terday, charging Charles Wangerman
with grand larceny.
Feturier told Warrant Clerk Graham
that be was approached by Wangerman
some time ago to go into a "good thing"
in the shape of a horse race. Feturier was
pleased with tbe scheme and advanced
Waterman $1500 on the agreement that
he would receive $200 out of Wangerman's
winnings.
Smce then Feturier has neither seen
nor h<-ard of Wangerman, and he was un
able to learn anything about the race,
wbicb he believes was a "fake."
Waneerman is an ex-police officer , and
until his disappearance kept a butcher
fifiop on Larkin street, near Turk.
Street Improvement Fight.
A writ of prohibition was yesterday granted
by Judge Slack restraining Auditor Broderick
from allowing the claim of the City Improve
ment Company for work oa the paving of Fol
com street. The writ Is returnable September
4 before Judge Seawell.
The writ Is tbe result of the apparently in
terminable litigation arising from the light
between the Jordan Bituminous Rock Com
pany and the City Improvement Company in
re^atid to street-vAViug contractc
IN THE REALM
OF THE FIGHTERS
Jeffries' Condition Was
Much Improved Yes
terday.
NATIONAL CLUB RULES.
Choynski and McAuliffa Indus
triously Training for Their
Contest.
OLD BARNEY AGAIN EXCITED.
Peter Maher Now Thinking of Chal
lenging Corbett for Another
Battle.
Contrary to a report printed in an even
ing paper that Jeffnea, who was to have
ruet Van Buskirk before the National Club
tne 25th instant, is in a very critical con
dition, it may be stated on tbe authority
of Dr. McCarthy, the attending physician,
thaTi Jeffries' condition is Tery much im
proved and that his speedy recovery is
hoped for.
Managers Gibbs and Groom say that as
soon as Jeffries is in good condition again
he will be matched under the auspices of
the National Club against some man of re
pute in the sporting world. There is no
doubt that the winner of the coming Mc-
Auliffe-Choynski contest will receive the
preference.
An excellent feature introduced by the
National Club in its articles of agree
ment is that any man striking his oppo
nent in a breakaway is guilty of a foul.
That this is an excellent provision can ad
mit of no question. Although under
.Marquis of Queensberry rules a tighter is
permitted to strike in a breakaway, the
public cannot be educated to the point of
accepting it and always raises a hue and
cry of "foul" when it is done. It has
also been a prolitic cause of police inter
ference, as the slower man will generally
hang onto his opponent, fearing a blow in
case he loses nis hold.
All tbe tighten are in training for the
various bouts. Stelzner is working hard
to put himself in fit condition to meet
Van Buskirk on tbe evening of August 25
at the Grove-street Theater and irom all
accounts will make a good battle, as in
addition to being a large and clever man
he has had the advantage of ten months'
experience as sparring partner to Fitz
aimmons.
Choynski is also in severe training for
his match with McAuliffe at Woodward's
Pavilion the evening of the 28:h inst.
Every afternoon he and George Green
have a raltling sparring set-to at the
Olympic Club. The intention is to fight
hard for the whole eight rounds.
Old Barney Parley came rushing into
"Young" Mitchell's saloon a day or so
ago and demanded excitedly to know if
the articles of agreement between ''chrys
anthemum" Joe and the "Mission giant"
did not call for a decision. When he was
informed that the point could noi be con
sidered as finally settled Barney exploded
with excitement.
"They mustl They must!" ho ejacu
lated. "Ivly boy Joe is going to make the
ti^ht of his life, and we don't want any
draws in this fieht. No, sir; we want a
decision."
Barney's mind was set at rest with the
statement that Graney would be seen
about it, and perhaps it could be arranged
that way. Graney has not yet concluded
whether he is willing or not.
Certain rumors have been in circulation
that Gallagher intended to "flunk" iiis
fi^hi with George Green for September 2.
Yesterday Manager Groom indignantly
denied this. He said a letter had been
received from one of Gallagher's trainers
saying he was getting into fine condition
and was confident of besting Green oa tbe
date named.
The sale of seats for the McAuliffe and
Choynski contest will becin on Thursday.
Several changes have been made in Wood
ward's Pavilion, and it now has a Beating
capacity of 6000. An excellent view of
the ring can be bad irom all parts of the
building.
Peter Maher has again reached the con
clusion that he should have another trial
at Corbett. Quinn, his manager, says he
has about concluded to challenge James.
If Corbett is willing to fight unknown
men like Tom Sharkey he thinks he
should be willinsr to give Maher a show.
Jack McAuliffe says his mill with
Jimmy Carroll is still on, and tiiat he will
probably meet him in October. In case
Jack wins he will challenge "Kid"
Lavigne. ___________
ATTORNEYS APPOINTED.

pensation or $1500, one-ha!f to be paid as a

Ad Old Cage Revived.
An aftermath of the Freeman-Edison and
Fort Wayne Electric Light companies was
heard iv the United States Circuit Court yes
terday when the case of Charles J. Armsbrus
ter against the Fort Wayue Electric Company
was called. This is an action to recover 5?2500
claimed to be due Attorney Booiie, who it will
be remembered fought so vigorously for his
clients during the recent litigation in this
City. The Fort Wayne Company refused to
pay Boone, who immediately assigned the ac
count to the present claimant. The matter
was argued by both sides and submitted to
Judge McKenna for decision.
Bodies Fruui the Bay.
The bodies of two men were recovered from

3IOXEY IN CIRCULATION.
Tbe amount of money in circulation In the
United states on August 1, 1896, was as follows:
Gold coin $445,293,944
Standard dollars 01.999,<97
j-Ã¼bsidiary silver. 59,663. 5bl
Gold certificates d9,'^9rf.479
Silver certificates 331,666,671
Treasury notes of 1890 93,948,532
United States notes 237.410,538
Currency certificates 41,540,000
National bank notes 214,096.620
Total * 1,514,903, 142
Same date 1895 1,614,533,786
Decrease $99,630,644
The shrinkage is in six descriptions. In the
other three there has been some increase. The
gains and losses are as follows:
Decrease-
Gold coin $40,484,666
Subsidiary silver. 868,947
Gold certificates 8,824,100
Treasury notes, 1890 20,055,^49
United States notes. 33,938.789
Currency certificates 15,380,000
Decrease $119,662,351
Increase-
Standard dollars. $252,091
silver certificates 11,301.553
National bank notes 8,367.063
Increase 19,921,707
Net decrease $99,630,644
One reason for this large decrease In the amount
of money in circulation is that the people made a
large loan to the Government last February, when
$62,315,400 in 4 per cent bonds was put out.
This loan, with the premium paid for the same,
absorbed about $70,000,000 of the money in cir
culation. This money has not been lost to the
couutry, as the Government, in borrowing from
Its citizens, practically borrowed from itself.

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 18. -The day was by
no means an important one at the Stock Ex
change and the transactions aggregated a very
small total. '1 his was a little surp.ising in view of
I lie sharp break in foreign exchange, which should
have a tendency to ease' up the monetary situa
tion. .; Posted rates for sterling exchange were re
duced a full cent to $4 86y a @s4 87, tie lowest
figures for some time, and actual business - was
done at material . concessions . from the quotations
Doted. This started some talk ' about *. early im
portations iof ' gold, but bankers do not share in
this opinion. Money lent up to 5 per cent on call
but â¢ later â¢ eased . off. Funds ; on . time continue
scarce and commercial paper is difficult of sale.
; None of these Influences had any particular effect
on the market for securities to-day and the deal
ings were confined almost entirely Ito the room
trading element. : At tne star/ quotations were oc
caslona ly in sympathy wiih i oudon and the re
ceipts of selling orders from that center, but the
bulls soon took hold, using Sugar as a lever to ad
vance the ' remainder of -, the list. Sugar sold as
high ; as 106 14. an advance of about 11* points

; CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
CHICAGO. In.. Aug. 18 â There was strength
n wheat at the opening this morning which only
â ould be accounted for on the theory that curb
sonditions bad been carried into the regular mar
jet. Afterward a further hardening of values
'ollowed a flurry In September oats, shorts ' doing
tome buying. The official Russian Government
report 'i was encouraging. It said: "Wheat crop
generally above an average yield. - Corn accounts
jnsatiÂ»facorr. In the rthern part of the east
ern portion of the grain, belt 'the crop is about an
iveraee one." Another cable to the Board of
rrade" said: "French harvesting is nearly com
jleted under favorable weather, conditions." The
one of the market after the early \ advance ' was
iteaiy, with trading light. Receipts at Chicago
vere 260 cars, and 18-, 550 bushels were taken
rom store. â¢
The Northwest had 488 cars, against 455 last
ruesday and 282 a year ago. â  Liverpool cables
were steady.' Export clearances were 423,000
Bushels, ' prices being assisted for the time; by
them, but there was a lack of confidence displayed
later, and the full appreciation filled 10 be main
tained. Closing Paris cables were 15 to 20 cen
times higher for flour, and 10 to 20 centimes
higher for wheat, as compared with Friday. Ant
werp was unchanged to 12% | centimes higher and
Berlin unchanged 10 14 of a mark higher.
Bradstreet's report of stocks was not issued to
day. The maiket was firm at the close on cover
ing by shorts. September wheat opened at 545/ c,
sold between Mi/ 2 c to 545/ 8 c and 553 gc, closing at
551 to 6514 c%cto %c hisher ihan yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 180 cars.
â Derived as.eady tone from the strength
of wheat and oats. Some consideration is being
given to the comparisons between corn prices per
ton and those of anthracite coal, and it is argued
that the fuel demand will solve the question of
the surplus corn crop. : Receipt! to-da^ were 717
cars, and 135.150 bushels were taken from store.
Liverpool cables were quiet and steady. Export
clearances were : 640,195 bushels. May corn
opened at 2684.(3.26 V B c, sold between 26~4@27y5c,
closing at 2G3/4@26'ygC, a shade under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 480 cars. .
OATS â Traders were treated to a flurry - this
morning, shorts in September, for some reason,
arraying themselves on the buying side, with
quite a unanimous appearance. ; : The sentiment In
oats Is bullish and those who have sold the grain
short would feel more comfortable if their con
tracts were evened. Receipts to-day . were . 288
cars and 000 bushels were withdrawn from

Legacies ' Declined-
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has re
cently sustained a peculiar will made by a
Philadelphia man, who left $2000 to the
Presbyterian Orphanage, and $2000 to the
Presbyterian Home for Widowi and Sin
gle Women, and to other charitable socie
ties smaller sums. The condition of the
bequests was if any of the beneficiaries
should give any support, aid or sym
pathy to what the testator considered
"the" pernicious fallacy of 'prohibition'
or its bantling 'local option,' or to
any other scheme for the total suppression
by law of the manufacture, sale or dis
tribution of liquor that will intoxicate
when used to excess," or show any un
friendly spirit against any person for
being engaged in the manufacture or sale
of liquor, then the legacies snould be
come void. The two Presbyterian so
cieties and the Indigent Widows' Society
declined to accept the bequests on ac
count of the conditions. They said that
while it was not their charter object to
take part in schemes for the Suppression
or the prohibition of the liquor tramc, yet
as they were connected with a religious
body which had been opposed to that
traffic, they felt that they could not accept
the legacy with such a condition an
nexed.
The Orphans' Court held that the whole
clause was too vague and indefinite to
allow the transfer to the charity which
was to receive the money if ihe condition
was violated, and held that the Presbyte
rian societies took their legacies clear of
any conditions whatever. The Supreme
Court decides that the conditions should
be fulfilled, and that there was no more
uncertainty in determining who were pro
hibitionists or aided and encouraged pro
hibition than in describing any political
party or religious creed. The legacies will
therefore not be received by the Presby
terian societies to whom gifts were first
made. â New York Tribune.

COLONEL SUTER,
Dredging Out a Deep- Water
Channel Will Save
Money.
OPPOSE A TIDAL CANAL.
Merchants' Exchange and Board
of Trade Want Ships at
the City's Wharves.
SAY ALAMEDA CAN WAIT.
After ;the Channel Ts Deep Enough
for Use Then the Canal Will Be
Dredged Advantageously.
Oaklakd Ofjick San Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 18. J
The Merchants' Exchange and the Board
of Trade of Oakland feel much elated at
the communication of Colonel Suter re
garding the improvement of Oakland har
bor. It was feared for a long time that
the opposition of Alameda to the work as
originally proposed would interfere in a
great measure with the system of improve
ment as outlined originally by Colonel
Mendell and later by Colonel Suter. They
now feel assured that what they call "mis
representation" on -the part of the people
on the other side of the estuary will have
no permanent effect, and that it has, in
fact, been already overcome in the United
States Engineer's office at Washington.
At the present time a deep-water chan
nel exists from Webster-street bridge to
about half way down between the training
walls. About $200,000 will be required to
complete this channel to deep water in
the bay, and about $50,000 is necessary to
complete the training-walls. When this
is done vessels of any draught that now
enter San Francisco Bay can bring their
cargoes direct to Oakland wharves. At
the present time the greater part of each
carÂ«ro consigned to Oakland has to be dis
charged in San Francisco and lightered
over here. It is argued by Oakland com
mercial bodies that the completion of the
Oakland end of the harbor as now outlined
will be as great an advantage to Alameda
as to this City.
It has bepn calculated that $1 per head
per annum of all the residents of Alameda
and Oakland represents the loss paid for
additional transportation, which could be
saved were there a deep-watÂ«r channel
direct to this City. This alone represents
about f 100,000 per year that is paid out of
Oakland pockets for comparatively no
return.
The main argument of the Alameda
peeple is that if the tidal canal were
dredged through first it would be a sani
tary measure and would carry the sewage
out to sea that now lies stagnant in the
canal basin. This argument is met by the
Oakland people that the Government has
no rieht and no power and no desire to
spend any appropriation to further the
sewage schemes of any uity. Such money
mast be spent solely for the improvement
of Government harbors, for the benefit of
commerce at large and not for any purely
local purpose. There is already a shallow
channel dredged from Adams Point
around the water front of East Oakland
that is sufficient at present for the small
vessels to po there. FTom Webster street
to Adams Point the channel has also been
dredged to accommodate the new wall re
cently built by the Adams estate. After
the completion of the deep-water channel
from tne bay work could then be under
taken with advantage at the other end of
the harbor until there was a complete
chip channel into San I>andro Bay if
necessary. The report of Colonel Mendell,
embodied in the Government statistics,'
states that no good purpose could be sub
served by beginning at the San Leandro
Bay end of the estuary.
C"oJonel Suter aJso says that the argu
ment of Dr. McLean of Alameda, that the
mud from the tidal canal and the East
Oakland flats is gradually filling up the
ship channel already dredged, is without
foundation. At the approach to the city
wharves a little bank occasionally forms
on account of the current which sweeps
around there, but in the channel already
dredged it is authoritatively stated that
no portion of it has been filled up, nor is
the depth in any part diminished, al
though considerable time has elapsed since
some of the dredging was done.
While Colonel Suter's Jotter will not
meet with .'avor to those who are repre
sented by Dr. McLean, it is thought by
those interested in the harbor on this side
that it permanently disposes of the con
test that has been waged bitterly for over
a year.
ANOTHER LIQUOR LICENSE
By a Vote of Three to Two the
Pacific Hotel Is Granted a
Saloon License.
Water Supply at Fires to Be In
creasedâThe Board of
Education.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 18.â After two
months' waiting, M. Debret has been
granted a license to conduct a saloon in
the Pacific Hotel. Trustee Hammond,
who conducts a saloon on the opposite
side of Park street, had the onus thrown
upon him of granting or refusing the
license, and he did not v^ : sh to vote on the
motion. The voting on a previous occa
sion had shown Trustees Fletter and Clark
in favor and Trustees Leydecker and
Forderer against increasing the number of
saloons in the city.
Eventually Hammond agreed with Flet
ter that the original license should never
have been transferred from the Pacific
Hotel to the house next door, as it had
been a saloon for the past twenty years,
and he voted aye.
The application of C. Helline for a
Hquor license to conduct a saloon in the
Encinal Hall, Bay street, was unani
mously refused.
WatÂ«r Pressure at Fires.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 18.â Fire Chief
Krauth laid a matter of great importance
before the City Trustees last night. It re
ferred to the water supply durii^ fires. ;
He pointed out that the Artesian Water :
Company had for the past two years been
trying to supply the city with a high
pressure water supply without pay, and
that its non-success on some occasions was
due to no fault of the company. He re
ferred particularly to the last two fires
within the past week. On Sunday ninht
through some mismanagement the sup
ply was for a time cut off. It appears
when a lire alarm is sounded the supply
pipe to the tanks on Park street is shut off
and it is then necessary to notify the com
pany at Fitchburg to start pumping. This
is generally done from the police station
and to prevent a similar set of circum
stances arising in future a line of wire and
a tapper at the city's expense is to be put
in the pumping station and connected with
the fire alarm system.
Board of Education.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 18.â At the reg
ular bi-weekly meeting of the Board of
Education this evening accounts to the
amount of $867 were passed for payment.
It was resolved that the finance commit
tee meet and draw up a statement of
money required oat of the next tax levy
and present the same to the City Trustees.
The Superintendent reported an increase
of 282 scholars since the opening of the
schools. The enrollment of pupils at the
schools was stated to be: Encinal, 558;
Porter, 524; Haitrht, 478; Wilson, 326;
Longfellow, 312; Everett, 115; High, 156;
Bay Farm, 21; night school, 51. He also
read the principal's office hours, and read
a synopsis of the time to be devoted to
teaching by the principals and the sub
jects to be handled.
BELL'S ACCOMPLICE.
Ludie Fieghe Arrested iv San Francisco
on Information Furnished by
His Father.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 18.â Officer Ham
merton arrested Ludie P. Fieghe last even
ing in Ban Francisco. He is charged witn
being an accomplice of Charles J. Bell,
who absconded with Agent Bergsten's
cash recently. Early in the day the boy's
father reported to Chief Lloyd that his son
was in San Francisco. Lloyd sent Ham
merton over, and about 11 o'clock he re
turned with tbe boy.
Bell and his friends claim that Fieghe
was the prime mover and Bell earned out
his part through fear. Bell claims tnat
Fieghe drngged him and Webster and put
them to bed. Be then robbed them of the
money and a rifle and ammunition wnich
he had purchased with the stolen money.
Fiegbe was dressed in a new suit when ar
rested, but had no money.
Fieghe will appear for examination next
Monday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock. Bail
was placed at $1000 cash or $2000 bonds.
He claimed he would furnish bail before
night, but up to a late hour to-night he
was still in the City Jail.

boldly for McKiniey, and they have de
clared that they will carry Fruitvale for
the Republican ticket unless there is too
much "free silver" put into the fight.
These young editors are: W. W. Hush,
V. G. Hush and W. F. R. Hush, and their
ages run from 16 to 10 years. Their news
paper is a solid institution, and they do all
the business â editorial and printing and
presswork â for it between school hours.
They are the children of Valentine G.
Hush, the Fruitvale capitalist, and their
advertising patronage extends from East
Oakland to Japan.
The Hustler has just completed its first
year of life, and the boy editors proudiy
announce that they have substituted
"Vol. II" for "Vol. I" on the first pace.
The Hustiers are firm in the belief that
Major McKiniey will be the next Presi
dent, and they are probably the youngest
Republican editors in the country.
'â¢We have not declared for McKiniey
without due thought," said Editor Valen

old. "We have become Republicans as
the result of convictions after giving the
matter serious attention. There is too
much that is flowery and like a balloon in
Mr. Bryan and his campaign, and his
financial views do not appear to us to be

The motto of the Hustler is: "Little

The youthful editors publish a biograph

they received from his private secretary,
James Boyle. A medallion picture of Mc-
Kiniey and Hobart ornaments the front
page and there is a refreshing odor of pro
tection on every page.

908 Bboadway, Aug. 18. j
The Alaska boom that struck Oakland
in the spring has about collapsed. For
the past few weeks people who went north
with a camera and a lunch basket to pho
tograph gold mines and come back rich
have been seen in their accustomed
hannts.
Some of those who merely came back
months ago to get more provisions are still
here and show no intention of returning,
and others boldly say they were duped
and denounce the northern country.
The latest wail from the goldfields is
that of Albert A. Shuite, a young law stu
dent, who left this city several months
ago. Shuite says in a letter to a friend :
Since June I have seen most of the mines in
this district, and the more I see the less confi
dence I have of being able to find anything
here. Two-thirds of the prospectors who came
here this season have already returned to the
States and before long few will be left here.
Trie mines thai were located here last year are
not yielding as much as had been expected
and the mines that have been located this year
do not pay wages.
As soon as possible after landing, my part
ners and I started out prospecting. We each
carried seven ty-five pounds of a pack, consist
ing of blankets, a prospecting outfit and food
for two weeks. We divided into two parties
and prospected about 100 miles of Six-mile
Creek and its tributaries. We found nothing
that was open to location, but saw several
good mines on Canyon Creek and on Mills
Creek which had been located last season.
Later we prospected on Granite Creek, a branch
of Six-mile creek, and have decided to open up
a claim there in the hope that we may be able
to strike something good, but we have but
little upon which to base our hopes.
The mosquitoes and moosefliea are quite
numerous now and are very annoying in their
attacks.
One of our party, a young man from Hoilis
ter, is now preparing to leave here, being un
ablo to longer stand their continued tortur
ing.
Discouragement has already entered our
camp, and ] am afraid that some of our party
will soon leave if nothing better than we now
have in sight is found.
All the claims in this district that were any
good were taken up last Â»eason, many men
having a dozen or more claims, one on each of
the several creeks that empty into Six m ile.
Some of the prospectors who have arrived this
year assert that one claim In a district is
enough for a man. Several parties have gone
so far as to jump claims, and much trouble is
expected as the result. One man has already
been wounded for jumping a claim, and more
shooting may result.
A general miners' meeting will be held here
the 27th ot this month, and it is hoped that all
the trouble over disputed claims will then be
adjusted in a satisfactory manner.
There are several Oaklanders here, but none
of them have yet found anything of impor
tance. F. D. Whitall of Oakland and Sam
Clark of Livermore have leased a claim on
Six mile Creek, but the claim has since been
Jumped by a number of persons, among whom
are Messrs. Tuohy and Alexander of Oakland.
The ownership of tbe claim will be decided
at the meeting of July 27. L. C. Leet and his
partners are camped with us here. They have
no claim yet. but Leet is panning on tbe beach
and sometimes g 'ts fair color.
Alfred Duiton is working a claim which he
has leased on Resurrection Creek, so Mr.
Tuohy told me.
Most of the Oaklanders expect to return to
their homes this fall.
Considerable prospecting is being done in
the surrounding country, but nothing good
hag been discovered. While crossing a glacier
on Twenty-mile Creek lnst week a prospector
named E. Kennah fell into a crevasse sixty
feet deep. His companions could not get him
out and were obliged to leave him to perish.
I still have hopes of finding something good
here and will remain until late in tbe. season
and perhaps all winter. The best time for
prospecting is from now until October, and one
has to remain late in order to make the most
of the short season.

M. C. Flaherty '96, the Carnot medalist of

been elected to fill the position.
The idea of Mr. Phelan in giving

to bridge over the hard times
through which the university is passing,
with the hope that before long the reeents
will appropriate means for the mainte

morning at Btiles Ha.l to meet the presi
dent and the prolessor* who are listed as

way what they would be expected to do
while in college and/what would become
of them if they did not do these things.
For an hour arid a half they listened to
the admonition of the professors and li
brarian, and when the speeches were over
they went out from the hall with the sat
isfaction that they were full-fledged
freshmen.

OAKLAND ASSESSMENTS.
The Board of Equalization Instructs
the City Assessor.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 18.â Tbe City
Council held a very important meeting as
a Board of Equalization. The question
before them was the assessment of the
banks' franchises and loans.
A resolution was passed instructing the
Assessor to place the following assess
ments on the roll: California Bank, fran
chise $1000 and loans $500,050; Oakland
Bank of Savings, franchise $3000, loans
$186,750; Union Savings Bank, franchise
$1500, loans $131,400; Central Savings
Bank, franchise $1500, loans $100,000;
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank} franchise
$500, loans $54,000.
The national banks were then taken up
and Attorney W. S. Woods argued on their
behalf. City Attorney Peirsol stated their
loans on stocks and bonds were not as
sessable, but franchises were. A resolu
tion was passed, however, declaring that
national bank.3 should be taxed.
Three years ago A. K. Alsipwas granted
a franchise for an electric road out Web
ster street and the Council assessed it at
$25,000. The road has never been built or
even commenced.
All kinds of legal difficulties will follow
the action taken to-night, as City Auditor
Snow has already given notice that tbe
board has no authority to dictate figures
to him, but only to order him to put on
the roils any property that might be
missed and leave the assessment to him.
He says he shall disregard the resolution.
CAKEWALKS FROWNED ON
Colonel Pearson Declares That
They Are Objectionable Re
minders of Slavery.
Johnson Says the Macdonough Judges
Were Bought for a Few
Dimes-
Oakland Officb Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway , Aug. 17. )
Cakewalks are certainly demoralizing,
so far as Oakland is concerned. Each
walk is followed by a scandal and the ex
hibition of personal feeling, and the best
elements of colored society have decided
to discountenance such contests in tbe
future. Consequently any participants in
a cakewalk from this date will be set down
as being unworthy of a place in the Afro-
American bluebook.
There was a cakewalk last night at the
exposition, and there is turmoil to-day.
There was a cabewalk at the Macdonough
Theater a niont h ago, and then there was
trouble. The cause of the trouble on both
occasions was the same â the disapproba
tion of Milton Johnson with the decision
of the Macdonough judges.
On each occasion Mr. Johnson made a
speech. At the Macdonough he indig
nantly relused the second prize, and last
night he received the first prize, and in
his speech of ccceptance he forgot him
self. Colonel Tom Pearson and Major
Felix Laford, both well-known colored
orators, are discomforted at the action of
Mr; Johnson and are opposed to cakewalks
in general, and Oakland cakewalks in par
ticular.
"I have figured in many cakewalks,"
said Mr. Johnson last night before an
audience of five thousand people, "and I
have always been treated justly, with one
exception. I am the champion cake
walker of the Pacific Coast, and at the last
cakewalk the judges sold themselves for a
few mildewed dimes." This was not tbe
exact language of Mr. Johnson, he would
not like to see it in print, but it caused
many people to turn their faces and cost
him his popularity. Up to that speech
Mr. Johnson was very popular, but it will
take years of walking for cakes on public
platforms before he~will regain his lost
prestige.
"Cakewalks are a relic of slavery times,"
said Thoma3 Pearson, who was born in slav
ery and wants to go to the Assembly, "and
respectable colored society should express
its disapproval of them. They are simply
10-cent theatrical numbers, fit to be carried
out by burnt-cork minstrels, but they are
beneath the dignity of a self-respecting
colored citizen.
Major vVaters, who was bailed onto! jail
yesterday mornine so that he could attend
the confest last night, disappointed his
friends and was not on hand. The major
stated to-day that he did not consider it
good form for a gentleman under arrest for
exhibiting a knife at a Republican primary
to appear in public till he had exonerated
himself.' , â¢

THEIR FIRST VICTORY.
Berkeley's Campus Strewn With
Canes, Mortar-Boards and
Sophomores.
ON THE STEPS OF NORTH HALL
A Struggling Mass of Students With
Remonstrating Professors on
the Outskirts.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 18â The fresh
men fairly routed the sophomores this
morning in a rush on the green in front of
North Hall. After the smoke of bat
tle had cleared away broken canes
and smashed dicers were much In evi
dence.
Professor Clapp, head of the department
of Greek, took a hand in the fray and
pulled several freshmen off the men that
were underneath. He reminded the on
lookers of the time that Regent Re in stein
pulled two fighting students apart during
the "student-labor" period and took from
them the hickory stick, over the posses
sion of which they were trying their mus
cle. President Kellogg and several other
of' the professors were present and at
tempted to call a halt to the affair, and
finally the bellicose college men gave heed
to the words of the president and broke
loose from their bold on one another.
President Kellogg then gave the contend
ing parties a lecture for their obs treperous
conduct.
The freshmen were coming npfrom their
meeting with the professors at Stiles'
I Hall when they were encountered by a
body of sophomores on the steps of tbe
North Hall, who refused to let tbe '00
men pass into tbe building. A freshie
snatched a mortar-board from the head of
a soph and threw it into the air. This was
the signal for battle, and almost within
tbe twinkling of an eye tbe contest wss
precipitated.
From the start the freshmen were in the
ascendancy. The upper class men lent aid
to the two factions, but saw to it that
justice was meted out on both sides.
Before the friendly fight commenced
about one-fourth of the sophomores who
were concerned wore mortar-boards, but
when they came to gather them up after
the "scrap" not a mortar-board was in
sight, and apparently no one knew where
the head-coverings of the sophomores had
gone.
It suffices to say that the quarters of sev
eral doughty freshmen are adorned with
the spoils of this combat.
Flushed with the success of the morn
ing, the freshmen declared vengeance to
the sophomores, and will "do" them
whenever opportunity presents itself.
They are confident of winning the an
nual rush, which it is understood will
take place some time next week, and after
having done so they say they will buy
canes as big as sawloga and carry them
wheresoever they please.
JJThe freshmen outnumber the sopho
mores in the ratio of about three to two
and have some heavy men among them;
and it is generally believed that they will
score an overwhelming victory in the an
nual rush.
In point of numbers and strength of
men the freshmen are about on a par with
the present junior class when they entered
college. The '98 men did not lose a single
battle either ia athletics or on the rushing
field during their first two years, and the
indications are that their record will be
duplicated by the '00 men to the loss of
the class of '99.
Dynamiter Devaney Htlenied,
LONDON, Exg., Aug. 18.â Thomas De
vaney, one of the Irish dynamiters who,
in Edinburgh in 1888, was sentenced to
penal servitude for life, was released from
Portland Prison this morning. Great pre
cautions were taken to prevent bis
being recognized, as it was believed that
the Irish and other sympathizers might
maice a demonstration. After his release
Devaney took a train for Glasgow.

CELTIC ONION OFFICERS,
Jeremiah Deasy Elected the
First President of the
Organization.
Alter Some Discussion the Selection
of the Executive Committee
Goes Over.
A meeting of delegates to tbe Celtic
Union was held last evening at K.R.B.HaII
for the purpose of completing the organi
zation by the election of officers. Colonel
T. F. Barry presided. The organizations
which are represented in the Celtic Union
are as follows:
County Lcitrim Club, Unity Alliance, St
Patrick's Alliance oi America, Young Ireland
Club, Gaelic Athletic Association, St. Patrick's
Mutual Alliance Association of California, Ex
celsior Alliance No. 11, St. Patrick's Alliance
of America No. 5 of Oakland, County Mona
gnan Club, Harmony Alliance No. 15 of San
Francis-co, St. Patrick's Alliance No. 12, An
cient Order of Hibernians Nos. 2. 9, 10, 11, 14,
15, 16 and 17. Knights of Tara, Knights of 6 t.
Patrick, boards of Erin, Lodges Nos. 1 and 4,
Rebel Cork Association, St. Patrick's Alliance
No. 16 of Oakland.
As set forth in the constitution, and as
declared by Colonel Barry at the opening
of the meeting, the objects of the union
are to bring together the various Celtic so
cieties of the Pacific Coast into one central
body, to inculcate and foster a spirit of
loyalty for the institutions and Govern
ment of the United States and for the
members to hold themselves in readiness
at all times to support the constitution
and aefend the honor of its flag.
For all the officers two ballots were
taken, an informal and a formal ballot.
On the informal ballot for president Colo
nel Barry received eighteen votes and Jere
miah Deasy fifteen. Colonel Barry re
quested his friends to vote for Mr. Deasv,
who was elected on the formal ballot â 20
ro!6.
P. McGushen was elected vice-president,
receiving 18 votes to 16 for Colonel
O'Byrue. Robert J. O'Reilly was elected
recording secretary, receiving 19 votes to
15 for John Mulhern. For financial secre
tary M. C. Gorman was elected, receiving
27 votes to 5 for D. E. Condon. There was
a tie vote for treasurer between Charles
O'Brien and John Mulhern, each receiving
16 votes on the formal ballot. Each of the
candidates immediately declined in favor
of the other, but this was ruled out of order,
and a third ballot was taken, which re
suited as follows: Mulhern 18, O'Brien 16.
The hour being late it was voted, after
some discussion, to postpone the further
election of officers until the next meeting,
when the sergeant-at-arms and the execu
tive committee will be named.

MATTIE OVERMAN HAS AT LAST CONFESSED
She Admits Her Criminal
Intimacy With Dr.
Brown.
IN THE HANDS OF THE
COUNCIL.
The Congregationalist Minister
Painted in the Blackest
Colors.
MRS. TUNNELL ALSO TELLS HER
STORY.
The Document Was Mailed From Los
Angeles and Is Sali to
Be Fully Authen
ticated.
Miss Mattie Overman of the celebrated
Brown case fame has at last confessed to
the intimacy with the ex-Congregational
minister that finally caused nis downfall
and retirement from the church.
The confession is in her own handwrit
ng, covering many bheets of legal cap and
for the present is in the safekeeping of
Rev. W. W. Scudder of Alameda, chair
man of the Congregationalist committee
on credentials. The document bears the
date of August 8, and was written in Los
Angeles, where she is now sojourning
under the protecting wing of one of the
Christian missions.
Miss Overman did not present her con
fession in person, but intrusted it to the
mails and on the 10th inst. Rev. J. K. Mc-
Lean of Oakland, who presided over the
counsel that triea Dr. Brown, was aston
ished to have it placed in his hands.
Not being quite sure of its authenticity,
Rev. Dr. McLean called a few of the most
available members of the council together,
and the document was given a searching
scrutiny. As the conviction dawned on
the ministers that the confession was gen
uine, all saw that a meeting of the coun
cil that had heard Miss Overman's efforts
to shield Dr. Brown was the proper thing,
aud those who live out of town were noti
fied to be presest at a meeting to be held
on Monday last.
The members of the council kept In
mind the fact that Mrs. Tunnell, the miss
ing and most important witness of the in
quiry, was in San Francisco, and she was
also callsd upon to Oe present at the gath
ering.
On Monday, at a place the members of
the council do not at present feel at lib -
cTty to designate, the following members
of the inquisition met in solemn con
clave:
Key. W. C. Pond, Rev. Mr. Rauthrauff,
Dempster McKee, S. F. Bufford and Rev.
W. D. Williams of San Francisco, Rev. J.
K. McLean, Rev. Dr. Mooar, Rev. Dr.
Freelanti and E. C. Williams of Oakland,
Rev. G. B. Hatch and J. L. Barker of
.Berkeley. Rev. W. W. Scudder of Alameda,
Rev. R. H. Sink of Stockton and Rev. H.
M. Tenny of San Jose. Mrs. Tunnell was
alÂ«o on hand.
As the confession had been given with
out tbe slightest solicitation on the part of
the Congregational ministers it was j
deemed best to first settle beyond a doubt j
that Miss Overman had written the im
portant document, and to this end all the
specimens of Miss Overman's handwriting
iv the possession of the council were
brought in evidence.
But a short time sufficed to show that
no other hand than that of the fair Mat
tie had been concerned in the mechanical
work of compiling the confession, and
then the council turned to the important
work of confirming her statements. As
this is the fourth version of her connec
tion witn Dr. Brown that Mis 3 Overman
has given, the council was naturally cau
tious and every detail was gone over with
the utmost care.
In their deliberations the ministers were
materially aided by Mrs. Tunnell, whose
knowledge of some of the facts was v cry
valuable.
Mrs. Tunnell also stated to the council
that Mattie had confessed fully to her of
her infatuation for Dr. Brown and of the
consequences. Mrs. Tunnell was appar
ently as anxious as Miss Overman to clear
up the mystery of the celebrated case and
answered all questions frankly and fully.
In her written confession Miss Overman
makes out Dr. Brown to be the blackest of
villains, and herself to be his willing tool,
ready to perjure herself for the sake of
having him held np to the world as a
much-abused man.
In her letter she said that her testimony
given at the church trial was untrue from
beginning to end, and that every state

ment made by her before the council had
been carefully rehearsed in the presence of
Dr. Brown that she might not say any
thing that would betray his guilty prac
tices to the people, who had looked upon
him as a model of propriety and virtue.
Miss Overman wrote that she was im
pelled to disc Jose the true story of her re
lations with the former pastor of the First
Congregational Church of San Francisco,
because she felt that some of the members
of the council had been reproaching them
selves for the findings in the church trial.
She wished to soothe their feelings by
telling them that had they declared Brown
guilty of one of the blackest crimes against
the church and society they would not
have gone amiss. Every word of her for
mer testimony, she said, was false, and
she did not hesitate to declare that she
had maintained improper relations with
Brown on many occasions. She did not
specify the times and places minutely or
in such a manner as to render verification
easy, but she stated in plain terms that
Brown had been criminally intimate with
her many times.
Many of the members of the council
were thunderstruck at this open avowal of
her own guilt, more particularly so on ac
count of her previous declarations, but
others said "I told you so," and insisted
on the investigation into Rev. Mr. Brown' 3
conduct being reopened.
"Did she tell you that Dr. Brown had
committed adultery with her on the trip
toTacoma?" was asked by Rev. Mr. Sink
of Stockton of Mrs. Tunnell.
Mrs. Tunnell replied that Miss Overman
bad sworn to her that she and Brown had
maintained improper relations throughout
that trip and on many other occasions.
When the council went back to the
Miss Mattie Overman, Who lias Made a Full Confession of Her Relations
With Dr. Brown. It Is a Startling Story.
document after their questioning of Mrs.
Tunnell had convinced them that the con
fession was genuine, they found that Miss
Mattie had begun by admitting that the
council was right in discrediting her
testimony given at the sessions in tne
| church. She said that she felt extreme
j remorse because she had tried to lead her
i friend astray and that she wished to make
as much reparation as lay in her power. â¢
Though there was no studied effort at
bitterness acainst Dr. Brown, there was
an undercurrent of resentment against
her betrayer that was manifest in every
other line.
At times the document was almost hys
terical in her confession of sin, and she
went into particulars regarding the con
nection of others with the case that the
council did not consider relevant and
which were not weighed with the portions
relating directly to the confession. She
said that she was trying to live an upright
life and outlive the past, and that her
only hope in doing so was to confess her
wrongdoing with the Dr. Brown.
The references tc the. connection of
others with the case are frowned upon by
those who were at the meeting, and until
the full text of the document is given to
the public, all have agreed to remain
silent, regarding them as having no spe
cial bearing on tbe matter.
As Dr. Brown has only been suspended
by the Coneregationalists a meeting will
be called in the near future to have him
formally expelled.
Tbe Bay Conference will at once take up
the case and wiil summon Miss Overman
from Los Angeles to appear before it and
tell about her intimacy v.ith Dr. Brown.
In her letter she dweJl3 t yon the fact that
she was coached constantly by Brown, and
when she comes before the Bay Conference
one of the most interesting tales yet
printed will be told of how he drilled
her constantly to prevent her letting slip
any inkling of the truth that would bring
disgrace and ruin upon him. In her let
ter ;Miss Overman did not say that sne
was willing to go back to San Francisco to
give her testimony, but her statements
indicated her willingness to do so, and
I Mrs. Tunnell assured the council that
! she and Miss Overman are anxious and
willing to relieve themselves of the bur
den of remorse that has hold of them
now.
THE SECRET SESSION.
Rev. R. H. Sink or Stockton Gives
His Version oT the Meeting.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 18.â Rev. R. H.
Sink of this city was >een and asked for
his story of the meeting. He had just re
turned from San Francisco and was not
averse to talking about tne matter.
"I cannot disclose the name of the mem
ber of the council to whom the letter was
written," he said, "but such a letter was
received several days ago by one of those
who sat in the church trial. She said in
it that she was greatly worried over the
thought that many of the members of the
council were reproaching themselves for
their findings. For one. I have never re
proached myself, for if I had had' my way
the report of the council that heard the
testimony given at the trial would have
been far stronger than it was. Miss Over
man did not hesitate to say that Dr. Brown
had been criminally intimate with her
many times.
"We found that we could do nothing in
matter, as we had no standing as a coun
cil to try him again. All felt that some
action on the part of the church should be
taken, and so we decide;! to turn the whole
matter over to the Bay Conference. This
body will not let Brown off so easily and
everything connected with this entirely
disgraceful affair will be brought out. I
THE SAN JfKAJNUIÂ»CO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST ISJ, 1896.
think he should be severely dealt with,
and the Bay Conference is now the proper
body to handle his case as it has his stand
ing under investigation now.
"Mrs. Tunnell was questioned very
closely," continued Rev. Mr. Sink, "and we
did not get through with her until a late
hour last night. I asked her if she knew
of Brown's intimacy with Mattie Over
man, and she said she did. What we
wanted to get from her were times and
places where the improper relations be
tween the guilty couple were maintained.
This is a difficult matter to do without the
presence of Miss Overman, and also a hard
matter to corroborate.
"I must refrain from stating where the
meetings were held yesterday and last
night, but can assure you that the facts as
you have them are entirely correct. Rev.
Mr. Scudder now Has the letter in his pos
session and its contents my be obtained
from him. 1 have been confident all along
that Dr. Brown was guilty, but we had not
the necessary proof before to bring in a
verdict charging this. Prompt action will
be taken by the ministers about the bay
and the matter is now entirely in their
hands."
WHERE IS THE LETTER?
Mr. Scudder Says It Is In the Hands
of Dr. McLean.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 18.â Rev. W. W.
Scudder was seen in Alameda to-night
and said that the Brown-Overman matter
has recently taken on a new phase.
"The whole matter is in the hands of
Dr. McLean," said Mr. Scudder. "Four
days ago Miss Overman gent a letter to
Mr. McLean in which she outlined her
connections with Dr. Brown from start to
finish. You know Miss Overman is a very
intelligent, well-educated young woman,
and when she undertakes to do any
thing in the way of letter- writing she gen
erally makes a very good job of it.
"The letter to Dr. McLean was not in-
tended, I believe, to be in the nature of a
public document, but rather partakes of
the character of a purely personal letter.
It is very elaborate as regards the details
and carries on its face the appearance of
truth. Nothing appears to be missing,
and each event from the time she first met
Brown is exhaustively told.
"The letter is largely in the nature of a
confession ana naturally some portions of
it, and some references to events that
transpired are somewhat in conflict with
what Miss Overmau testified to at the trial
of Dr. Brown. Many new facts are
brought out and much new matter Is nar
rated, but nothing appears that is at all
favorable to the late pastor of the San
Francisco First Congregational Church.
"At the same time it does not appear
that Miss Overman was prompted by any
spirit of vindictiveness or malice, but
rather that she prefers to set herself right
before the world. It was apparently
purely a conscientious motive that
prompted her to act as she did. Of course
I cannot say anything regarding the truth
of her statements, but one thing seems to
dovetail into another so readily that much
that is circumstantial easily takes on the
appearance of being true and reliable. It
is very evident that Miss Overman enter
tains no longer any love or even respect
for Dr. Brown, and some of her state
ments are most damaging.
"She leaves out all that the trial brought
forth or the newspapers published and
leaves Dr. Brown's character blacser than
ever. There is nardly a thing that haa
been suggested even, that Miss Overman
does not recapitulate, and as I already
said, in a manner that is indicative of the
truth. Of course it must be borne
in mind that Miss Overman is aware of the
fact that Dr. Brown is far away from
here and will probably not reply, and this
may have prompted her to say many
things about which she would otherwise
have remained silent. Such a confession
as she has written must not be considered
hastily, but rather charitably, and al
though the assertions in the letters re
ceived by Dr. McLean are somewhat
startling it is but just to think that some
of tnem may appear in a different light
after they are explained.
"The letter is in the keeping of Dr. Mc-
Lean, but its contents are known to the
members of the investigating board that
sat on the trial of Dr. Brown. There are
some points that are not quite satisfactory
to us, ana a correspondence has been
opened with Miss Overman with a view to
straightening them oat. When all is
ready I believe the whole matter will be
laid before the Bay Conference for con
sideration.
"Of course, I cannot say what action, if
any, will be taken. Probably Dr. Brown
will be communicated with and given an
opportunity to answer, but this is only
conjecture. When Miss Overman has
sent her replies to Dr. McLean regarding
the portions of her letter that do not ap
pear to be clear, the whole matter will
probably be given to the press.
"Although the confession is very inter
esting it does not contain any matter that
can really be considered as particularly
new, but its details throw a great deal of
light on much that has hitherto been
somewhat vague."
Dr. McLean Is Silent.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aag. 18.â Dr. J. K.
McLean positively asserts that no meet
ing was held to-day, but when qrestioned
regarding Mattie Overman he absolutely
refused to say a word. Not a syllable
could be got from him except a hint that
ne had been pledged to keep silent.

I
BOAS MAKES SOME
STARTLING CHARGES
He Wants a New Trial
of a Suit Against
Him.
POINTED ALLEGATIONS.
Says Improper Influence Was
Exercised on tbe
Jury.
SOME STEONG AFFIDAVITS
Thomas Dolan, a Juror in the Case,
Tells a Peculiar
Story.
The suit of the Lombard Loan Company
against R. I. Whelan and others, which
every one thought was ended last April in
a plaintiff's verdict for over $2000, has
again arisen in tbe Superior courts on a
motion for a new trial. Judah Boas, the
"and others" of the defendants' side of
the case, makes the motion, and in doing
so springs a sensation.
His motion is based on what he alleges
was corrupt influeuce brought to bear on
thÂ« jury which rendered the verdict, and
in submitting his motion he includes affi
davits from all having any knowledge of
the case.
The original suit was one for conversion
of property brought by the Lombard Loan
Company against the Sheriff and every
one connected with the attachment which
hung over the goods and chattels of the
pawnshop. Tbe predecessors of the Lom
bard Loan Company were J. L. Salomon
& Co., and to that firm Judah Boas had
loaned some thousands of dollars. It
filed a petition in insolvency, but this
was dismissed, and then the company was
made a corporation.
Just after the incorporation Boas levied
an attachment on the property of the
corporation, and the Sheriff was put in
charge. But tne Lombard Loan Company
claimed that the property belonged not to
Salomon & Co., the plaintiffs in the
case, but to the corporation, and ac
cordingly the corporation brought suit for
conversion of property against the Sheriff
and all concerned, for $10,000 damages.
It was in the trial of the suit that Boas
charges corruption.
In the action for conversion H. C.
Dibble and G. B. Young were attorneys
for Boas, Fairall for the Sheriff and Whaly,
Davis & Bell acted for tbe plaintiffs.
Shortly after the trial commenced, says
Boas in his affidavit, he learned from a
conversation he had with Mr. Fairall that
improper and corrupt means were being
used by the officers of plaintiff's company,
or some one on its behalf, to influence the
jury and secure a verdict against him.
He told Fairall he would have nothing
to do with any such business, and then
he told Mr. Dibble. Dibble told him to go
to Morse's detective agency and send
Captain CallunJan to his (Dibble's) office.
This he did.
Boas says he did not know any of the |
jurors, but he frequently saw in the court
room a heavy-set man with a lull black
mustache, who he was told was a jury j
broker working for the plaintiff. He also |
saw a man he afterward learned was
named Crawford talking to a juror named
Sweeney. His actions were also suspicious
to Boas, Young and Dibble, and he was
continually running in and out of the
courtroom.
Judge Daingerfield was notified, and he
advised Boas to wait until some definite
charge could be made and then to report
the matter to him. This ended Boas'
statement.
Thomas F. Dolan, one of the jurors in
the case, deposed as follows: On the i
afternoon of April 21, 1896, he met Mr. i
Dibbie in the hall and walked toward the I
courtroom with him. Wnen nearly op
posite the Judge's chambers one of the
jurors, unknown to him then but after
ward found to be Francisco Toboas, came
running from the courtroom and said to
him, "Come down here, I want to see
you." Toboas a^ked him if he had made
up his mind in the case, and he said no,
he had not heard all the evidence. "Never
mind." said Toboas, and he led Dolan
down past the District Attorney's office.
Here Dolan says he saw Mr. Fairall talk
ing to a shabbily dressed man with a
black mustache who held a piece of ma
nilla paper in his hand. As they came
up to the two men Toboas drew near to
them. Then he asked Dolan what his
name was. Dolan told it. Then Toboas
asked the man, "Is that man on your
list?" and he said "T. F. Dolan? Yes."
Then the shabbily dressed man asked
who was the foreman of the jury. To
boas turned to Dolan and repeated the
question, and Dolan said there was no
foreman. Then the man said he would
see Toboas about "this to-morrow." Then
Toboas turned to Dolan and said: "You
don't care what way you vote on this
thing, do you?"
"What do you mean ?" said Dolan.
"There is some stuff in this; the other
side is puttine up and this side iÂ§ going
to do the same thing, and you might as
well get in on this thing," was the answer.
Dolan asked him if he did not know he
could be sent across the bay for such work,
and Toboas asked who was going to give
the thing away. Then Dolan instructed
him to say no more to him of the matter.
Afterward Dolan asked who the third
man was, and Toboas said it was some one
he ha-t brought up, but he could not tell
his name. Dolan then asked where the
money was coming from, and Toboas said
it came from FairalS'a side and the man
who had just left them. The money
would be left at their houses, and no one
would know from whom it came.
In the morning in the jury-box, Dolan's
affidavit continues, Toboas said: "How
are you stacking up?"
"What do you mean?" said Dolan.
'I thin* that thing fell through " To
boas answered him.
About an hour after, continues Dolan
some one opened the door of the court
ro Â° m - Do| an would not be positive
whether or not it was the man he had seen
the aay before. The man in the door
drew his finger across his throat and
k>oked over to the jury-box. Dolan asked
roboas if he had seen him, and Toboas
said he had not.
Continuing Doian said Toboas kept talk
ing in the jury-box, and among other
things he said Boas had "lots of stuff and
that v he would put up it would fix things
all right." Toboas had told Dolan that it
was Ins first experience on a jury and he
. not understand things. Toboas aiso
asked if Duian knew Harry Brickwedel. an
other of the jurors, and Dolan said "No."
After the verdict Toboas said to Dolan he
thought the "other side" was fixed and
Had put up money. Dolan states that he
asked what made him think so, and To
poas said he just thought so, and he
thought Brickwedel was in it. Further,
Dolan says Toboas cuanged his vote in the
jury-room several times. First he was for
plaintiff, then for defendant, then for
plaintiff again and then once more for de
fendant. BricKwedel alter the verdict had
been rendered, Dolan says, told him he
thought Toboas was "fixed."
Gus S. Spalding, one of Morse's men,
made affidavit that he had shadowed a
man named Crawford on Anril 27. He
followed him from Department 2 of the
Superior Court to several places around
town and back to Department 2 again,
where Attorney Whaley left his seat in
court and gave Crawford |2 50.
Henry C. Dibble, Boas' attorney, de
posed that the Sheriff told him improper
influences were being brought to bear on
the jury. Dibble at once reported the
matter to Judge Daingerfield, and then
put Morse's agency on the case.
Dibble swore further that David A.
Baum told him He thought, from a con
versation he had overheard, that the jury
was fixed. Toboas had told him some
thing to that effect. Baum said that in the
jury-room one juror wanted to vote to al
low $10,000 damages, when the amount
claimed was really only $572325.
E. B. Young, of defendant's counsel,
swore that he often saw a dark man with
a full mustache hanging around the
courtroom. He noticed that the jurors
wanted a recess so frequently as to cause
remarks, and on one occasion he followed
John Sweeney out into the hall. There,
Young states, Sweeney met the dark man,
known as Crawford, and the pair were in
conversation during the intermission.
The foregoing is the substance of the af
fidavits wuich, together, make Boas' mo
tion for a new trial. The matter will be
fully exploited when the case cornea up in
court.
ATTORNEYS WERE AFRAID.
What Judge Daingerfield Surmises
After Making a Partial
Inquiry.
"So far as I have examined I do not
think there is a great deal in tile case,"
said Judge Daingerfield last night,
"thongn something serious may come to
light before I get through with the jurors.
I am taking their testimony one at a time
and have finished with but three of the
twelve. I have summoned the whole
panel to appear in court to-morrow morn
ing, but of course I shall not be able to
examine them all for some time.
"My notion at present \3 that each side
was afraid of the other, and that is the
way the suggestion of crooked work with
the jury got started. The attorneys for
both sides have come to me and expressed
their entire willingness to help me in get
ting at the facts of tbe whole matter.
"During the trial, Dibble, one of the at
torneys for the defense, said that he
thought there was something the matter
with the jury. I cautioned him at once
not to attempt to prejudice my mind by
such a remark, but if he had any cause for
it to submit a statement to roe. I also
heard the rumor from my shorthand re
porter, but I checked him and said I
would see further. Then my vacation
came and now I have just resumed the
examination.
"Boas claims that Fairall, the lawyer,
claimed that a judgment was purchas
able. There seems to be nothing tangi
ble. H. H. Davis, an attorney for the
plaintiff, says that after examining a cer
tain juror, I would get one who would
tell, and there was also talk of a man by
the name of Crawford, who is said to have
acted as go-between."

and the Ashbury Heights Im
provement Club.
For some time past residents of Ashbury
Heights and vicinity have been holding
meetings and a number of small clubs
have been organized in consequence. At
the same time it was evident tb^at little
good could be accomplished save by some
concerted plan of action, certain organiza
tions to have charge of certain districts
bounded by well defined limits.
In accordance with this general convic
tion a meeting was held last night at 1970
I'age street, which was attended by nearly
200 persons, all of whom were members
either of the Ashbury Heights and Stan
yan-street Improvement Club or of tne
Panhandle Improvement Club.
In order to effect a temporary organiza
tion Dr. Salfield was elected chairman and
Mr. Cranston secretary until the forma
tion of the proposed new Ashbury
Heights and Panhandle Improvement
Club shall have been accomplished. Mem
bers of both clubs are anxious to effect the
consolidation, and the new club will inter
est itself in the development of the terri
tory bounded by Baker street. First ave
nue, Fulton street and the Mission
Heights.
Little was done beyond the entering of
an informal protest against the present
condition ef Oak and Stanyan streets, it
being impossible to drive to the park
through either one without great discom
fort and some danger.
A vigorous kick was also registered
against the establishment of the Pest
house upon the Almshouse tract, since in
that event the vans conveying lepers and
small-pox patients would have to pass
through the park.
It was also contended that the drainage
from the Pesthouse might infect the
waters of Laguna Honda, whence a large
portion of the Western Addition draws its
water supply.
No definite action was taken on the is
sues raised, it being considered more
proper to await the consolidation of the
two clubs. The utmost harmony between
the two organizations is one of the strong
motives for believing that the endeavors
of the new club wiil be rewarded with
success.
HOME INDUSTRY FAIR.
The Opening to Be Marked by a Dis
play of Fireworks.
The board of directors o! the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association met
yesterday and Manager Tacy reported
that twelve manufacturers of boots and
shoes desire to use the association's trade
mark upon their goods. It seems that
there is a big obstacle in the way of their
doing so. Many of the large retail dealers
to whom they sell insist that the boots
and shoes shall not bear the makers'
names, as would be necessary if the asso
ciation's trademark is used.
The retailers want to stamp their own
names upon the goods, and they do so
even when the shoes come out of Eastern
factories.
It was decided to call a meeting of the
shoe manufacturers and directors of the
association to see if ways and means can
be devised to overcome thÂ«% obstacle and
induce retailers to depart from the obnox
ious practice.
Manager Tacy and Director Bowers had
a complaint to 'make of the Mechanics' In
stitute for putting the sign "Mechanics
Fair Opens September 1 and Closes Octo
ber 3." They argued that this is a home
industry fair in which both institutions
are equally interested, but the Manufac
turers and Producers' Association is to
tally ignored on tl.e big sign.
The special committee that is arranging
for the Manufacturers' and Producers'
opening night at the exposition reported
that on that occasion there would be
special features. On both towers of the
Pavilion red fire would be displayed and
fireworks and bonfires would be witnessed
on the streets. The exercises will be held
in the art gallery, and no doubt Senator
Perkins and General W. H. L. Barnes
will speak. The vice-presidents will con-
Bist of about 2CO well-known citizens.
The Steamer Monricelio.
The steamer Monticello, plying between this
City and the navy-yard at Mare Island, Vallejo,
Benlcia and other upper bay ports, will be laid
up to-day and to-morrow for repairs. Friday
she will again tÂ»wÂ« mm bar daily rim.
