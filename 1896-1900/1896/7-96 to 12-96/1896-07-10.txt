GRKAT NORTH HOTEL. V
CHICAGO, Hi;, JULY 9. )
The representatives of National Democracy spent to-day iv the delightful game
of rats and dogs.
Tillman of South Carolina 'was the firebrand of the occasion/ He poured vitriol
down the backs of the New York delegation and scored the New York Democracy.
In his most sneering ami sarcastic tones he asked, "Where is New York now ?" and
he was answered by several delegates, "In the soup." This was calculated to re
store harmony in the party. â¢ . -
Tillman repeated his attack upon the Integrity of President Cleveland and was
frequently interrupted with hisses. On more than one occasion the chairman was
obliged to plead with the convention to give the fiery and abusive Southerner a
hearing, livery word uttered by him was a wedge driving the two factions of the
party more and more apart. .
Bryan of Nebraska made the most effective speech of the convention. One of
his utterance* raised a hurricane of applause. That was when he said, speaking
of the laboring man: "You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this
crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."
There was an enormous' crowd at the evening session, and the names of
Bland, Boies and Bryan a* they were placed before the convention were greeted
with prolonged cheers and shouts. When the name of Joe Blackburn of Ken
tucky was mentioned there was a great wave of cheering and the band struck up
"My .'Old^Kentucky Home," bringing the South to her feet with a yell and a
waving of hats and flags'.' ' Â '
When the name of Illinois was called that State reported that it had no can
didate. ' New Jersey's chairman replied: "We will nominate no man on the
platform of this convention." The declaration was greeted with hisses.
New York had no candidate. -
It was midnight when John R. McLean was mentioned, but not much en
thnslasm was evoked. Texas, through Bailey, seconded the nomination of
Bland. â¢ '.'.
Joseph L. Bawling of Utah seconded the nomination of Bland. West Virginia
seconded Blackburn. General - Bragg of Wisconsin announced that his State
would not participate in the nomination of any Democrat on a free-silver plat
form. The declaration brought a storm of hisses.
One of the silver delegates announced that Wisconsin would vote for Bland
in November.
This was at 12:25 A. M. and the Democratic ship was fast going to pieces.
Bragg of Wisconsin rose to make some other remarks, but wu hissed down
by the silverites and was not allowed to speak. *
At 12:27 the convention adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. .

CONVENTION HALL, CHICAGO, 111.,
July 9. âThis his been a day of days in
the history of National political conven
tions. From early morning until late at
night, with v.e exception of a three hours'
intermission, the gigantic Coliseum, the
largest hall in the world, was crowded to
the doors with iuterested and enthusiastic
spectators.
But great in number as had been the
masses who attended the morning and
afternoon sitting, they were as nothing in
comparison to the tremendous, record
breaking audience that thronged the stu
pendous hall at the evening assembling.

Such a gathering had never beer seen
at a National convention. Floor and gal
leries formed one great mass of solid hu
manity.
Where the narrow ribbons of aisles had
marked the various divisions of the huge
interior there was gathered hundreds, per
haps thousands, of those who could not
find other accommodations. Every chair
was filled, and some idea of the meaning
of this may be gained by the knowledge
that the Coliseum has a seating capacity
of 16.000.
And in addition to the myriads who
choked and crowded every available space
many more, estimated at 5000 in number,
were gathered about the entrances during
the greater part of the evening, tickets in
hand, fruitlessly clamoring for admission.

by the Divided Demoepacy of the .Nation, .Now in Convention at Chicago.
marfcable demonstrations of enthusiasm,
but the pinnacle of emotional expression
was reached in a scene wonderful in it
present attention, remarkable in its spon
taniety and unprecedented, probably, in
any similar gathering of a political party.
There has been an outburst of en
thusiasm stirring to behold when David B.
Hill finished a great rhetorical effort in
antagonism to the platform presented by
the committee on resolutions; the vast
assemblage had listened to a sensational
speech by Senator Tillman replete in im
passioned expression and in incrimination
of President Cleveland and had showed
approval and disapproval by cheers and
hisses.
But when William J. Bryan of Nebraska,
handsome, vigorous and magnetic, and
not unlike McKinley in voice, inflection
and facial expression, concluded the effort
of his life in support of the free-coinage
platform, there occurred one of those
scenes which sends the blood coursinir fast
through the veins of even the most passive
spectator and remains fixed in the memory
for a lifetime.
Like the terrible premonitory rumbling
that gives warning of the approach of lv,
--000 cattle stampeded, delegates and spec
tators began the ovation to the young
Nebraskan. And then the volume of
sound grew and grew until it could grow
no more, and enthusiasm went mad as
Bryan, in his passage down the aisle
toward the Nebraska seats, was caught in
the whirlwind of frenzied enthusiasm and
lifted high on the shoulders of delegates.
From floor to gallery the waves of ap
plause swept, and back again from gallery
to floor, and when the shouting, yeiling,
cheering masses fell back exhausted, Wil
liam J. Bryan had been cast into the arena
of Presidential hope as a full-fledged can
didate for his party's nomination.
An attempt on the part of Senator Till
man to have the convention condemn
President Cleveland and ais administra
tive policy had been frustrated by many
protests from Senator Jones and Bryan,
who, though admittedly anti-administra
tion in their views, decried any abuse of
the man who had been twice the choice of
their party.
Senator Tillman, aimonished by the
cheering which gave commendation to the
remarks of Jones and Bryan, withdrew his
resolution.

Chicago, Hi., July 9.)
Wil'iam J. Bryan of Nebraska is the idol
of the convention to-nii:ht, and if a ballot
is taken before adjournmant he will prob
ably be nominated. The California dele
gation wili cast two-thirds of its vote for
| him.
I know Bryan well, having served with
him in the Fifty-third Congress. He is a
! much abler man than Bland and possesses
ali of the other grand and admirable
qualities of character which have made
Bland distinguished and beloved in public
and in private life.
He, equally with Bland, would be a log
ical candidate on the leading issue of this
campaign and has elements of strength
which Bland does not possess. As against
all other candidates named, I would sup
port Biand. but as 'between Bland and
Bryan, I will vote for Bryan.
A great demonstration has just taken
place for Boies of lowa, who seems to be
the favorite of what are called the- con
servatives. It looks as if the contest may
finally be- reduced to Boies on one side
and either Bland or Bryan on the other.
In that contest the gold men would vote
for Buies, but whether in good faith to se
cure the nomination of the strongest can
didate or to handicap his campaign by
saddling it with the suspicion that he has
sought their aid, it is impossible at this
time to say.
The debate on the platform to-day was
a battle of giants, but the superb bearing,
imoassroned eloquence and: personal mag
netism of Bryan eclipsed them all. HiH
was not at his best, but was grandly elo
quent and impressive. The fiery elo
quence of Tillnian was marred by un
necessary harshness and by unwise, if not
offensive, sectionalism.
At the conclusion of his speech, Senator
Jones of Arkansas felt called upon to state
that with the sectionalism expressed by
Tillman the great body of silver De
mocracy of the West and South had no
sympathy.
The debate was a thing to be remem
oered, but it made no impression upon the
firmly fixed views of the delegates. Both
sides, determined and even stubborn, will
heed no argument until the work which
they came to do has been fully done in ac
cordance with thfir preconceived convic
tions and the wishes of their constitu
ents.
After the convention the gold men will
commence to study the silver question.
As predicted the anti-funding biil plank
was adopted by the convention this morn
ing, and the Californians here are corre
spondingly happy to-night

BRYAN'S HOME POPULARITY
Mention of His NÂ»me for President
Causes Wild Enthusiasm in
NebraÂ«Ka.
OMAHA, Nbb., July 9â When the news
was flashed over the wire to-night that the
name of W. J. Bryan of Nebraska had
been placed in nomination at Chicago for
President, a shout went np from the great
crowd assembled in front of the World-
Herald building to read the latest news of
the convention.
Republicans, Populists and sound-money
men joined in the enthusiasm. One gray
haired veteran threw iiis hat high in the
air, and this was a signal for a general
demonstration.
At Lincoln, the home of the Nebraska
candidate, the news was received in a
similar manner. Great crowds blocked
the streets until after midnight in the
hope that a ballot might be taken.
The mention of Mr. Bryan's name in
the convention was a great surprise to his
friends here.

Dana Repudiates Democracy.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 10.â The Sun this morning, in the following editorial,
formally repudiates the National Democratic platform and supports McKinley for the
Presidency:
Southern poverty, encendered by the war, and the common discontent stirred up
to recklessness by the agitation of the past twelve years, have at last blazed into a
demand tor debased coinage and a tax on wealth, and have carried the National Demo*
cratic Convention.
r 'ie Cbicaco platlorm cannot b* accaptad. The Hutted Sines was made Pomo

Free silver coinage would be National dishonor and a monumental anachronism*
Silver has nad its day as the morey standard.
The commerce of civilization which has used as a medium of exchange pretty
much everything from shells to the higher metals has progressed beyond silver. It
haa adapted its-elf to gold and to ,*old it will have to stick until it rinds something
still more convenient.
The silver campaign is based on delusions which have ho justification and on
statements which are not so. It cannot prevail and every sincere believer in fair deal
ing and in business honor as the foundation of commercial prosperity must put aside
all other purposes and unite for its defeat.
From now until the night of election day in November, 1896, the Presidential can
didate of every Democrat who favors honest money and who still hopes to crush the
enemies of the fundamental principles be waa brÂ«d in, should be, without hesitation,
evasion or prejudice, William McKinley.

Chicago, 111., July 9. )
The act of the convention yesterday
leaves no further outrage necessary to ac
complish its purpose, but Governor Evana
of South Carolina, who said in his speech
at Atlanta last fall, 'The South is getting
in the saddle again and will rule the
country," has proposed a further wrong.
He threatens to expel the whole New
York delegation from the conven tion,
and if a motion were made to that effect
it would carry by as large a majority as
that which assassinated Michigan.
That people at home may understand
the latter case let the facts be known. The
credentials committee voted to unseat tha
four Michigan dele gates-at- large. Three
of them were elected by acclamation in
the State Convention, there being no
candidates against them, therefore there
could be no contestants. The fourth waa
elected on a rollcall by a majority of 173.
In the committee Mr. McLaurin of Mis
sissippi moved to expel the first three and
seat in their stead three men who were not
before the Michigan convention at all,
were not nominated therein and not voted
for nor heard of, and to give the fourth,
seat to the man who was beaten by 173
votes. It will be observed that this is the
entry of a National convention into the
State of Michigan iv act as a State conven
tion and create representatives who were
not before the actual State convention at
all. This astounding proposition was jus
tified by Mr. McLaurin on the gound that
he thought the Michigan State Convention
did not properly represent the party in
that State and this National â convention
had the riyht to create a delegation in line
with what it considered to be party senti
ment there.
This Mississippi view of States' rights
was not too rank for the eminent Mr.
Burke of Los Angeles who ornaments the
credentials committee for our State. Ha
supported it and ii carried in the commit
tee by two to one. The old Democracy
denied the right of a Republican majority
in Congress to elect Spencer as Senator
from Alabama and Kellogg and Pinchback
from Louisiana, when those States by law
ful forms had chosen others. The new
Democracy is that form of Republicanism
against which we defended the South.
After the credentials committee had
made up this report it was not sent to the
convention. The expulsion of Nebraska
was accomplished and the Michigan casa
was taken up again. The committee at
last concluded to assault only four district
delegates and let those at Jarge alone, and
this was its final report. Take now the
one case of Congressmen Weadock and
Fisher in the Fourth Michigan Dis
trict. In the district convention they ran
against each other for delegate. While
the roll was being called, Weadock having
a slight lead, Mr. Fisher moved to suspend
the rollcall and elect Mr. Weadock by ac
clamation. This motion carried, Mr.
Fisher voting for It. The credential!
committee took the seat away from Wead
ock and gave it to Fisher, on whose motion
Weadock had been elected, and the Na
tional Convention ratified this action.
I don't think any comment can bring
this infamy into plainer relief than the
statement that Mr. Burke, the rose of Cali
fornia's expectancy, voted for it in com
mittee and convention. Our delegation
stood eleven for Weadock to six for Fisher,,
That the credit and discredit may fall
where they belong, let the roll be pub
lished. It siood.
Weadockâ White, Coleman, Wise, FitzÂ«2
geraid, Leake, Dwyer,. Metz^er, Ragan,

Fisherâ Foote, Btaguire, Dozier, Lane,
Caminetti. Burke.
In this contest was an element not seea
on the surface, Wea^ockhas made a linn
figut in Michigan against tbe A.' P. A.
The members of that organization in this
convention banded against hiu. Mr.
Foote, who was willing to walk to Sacra
mento to blow out a dark lantern, is the
toast in the lodges of intolerance to-day
throughout Michigan.
Interest in the convention as a slaughter
house ceased with this rollcall. There
will be furious scenes over tbe personality
of candidates, but public interest lags.
When an assassin wound 3 his victim with
the first shot there is an excited rush to
the rescue, Dut wben his work is hnished
no one tries to keep him from firing into
the corpse, for he cannot hurt it. The
community then takes an interest only in
his punishment.
The platform will be discussed to-day.
The majority has refused in tbe commit
tee as it will in the convention to protect
existing contract-. The money plank pro
vides for the repudiation of every existing
contract payable in gold, and demands
that the making of specific contracts in
the future be made a felony. As the plan
is retroactive upon the rights of property
by repudiating pas: contracts it might as
well be applied ex-post-facto to the rights
of persons and devote to penal servitude i
the men wno made the contracts which it
reaches backward to destroy. It aiso at
tacks life tenure in office which tbe con- i
sdtution grants to Judges of the Federal
courts, and which is one of the prime
safeguards against anarchy. It is said this
plank was drawn by Debs.
The minority report on the money plank
was presented and Tillman opened the de
bate. He was coldly received. In ten
minutes he iost control of the convention
and audience and then lost his voice, his
head and everything but his venom.
When he abused Cleveland and Carlisle,
tbe hisses sounded like steam escaping
from a thousand boilers. When he boasted
that South Carolina broke up the Demo
cratic party in 1860 on a sectional issue
and tbat the siiver i?bue is sectional, his
Jess frank ex-Confederate comrades were
uneasy. Wben he closed, poor old Jones
of Arkansas had to get out his vocal needle
and thread, and patch the tatters Tiilman
had torn with his fangs. Jones wept that
any one should hav<s mentioned sectional
ism. As for him he was willing to die as
often as necessary for silver.
After the moist Jones had been wiped
iff the stage, Senator Hiii appeared to
speak for the minority report. Here was
the last chance for the old Democracy.
For twenty minutes 15.000 people cheered,
stood up, waved bars and handkerchiefs,
stamped and stormed. The chairman, '
Richardson cf Tennessee, was mad of I
course and trie! to atop it, but the more !
he tried the more it wouidn't stop. The
Southern delegations scowled and swore.

The Call's Headquabtebb, 1
Geeat Nobthers Hotel, V
Chicago, liL, Jaly 9. J
Pitchfork Tiilman of South Carolina
became to-day the evil eye of the Demo
critic party. He placed upon it a hoodoo
from which it will take many years to re
cover. He has become the tagatbi, the
bad medicine man, the evil-omened totem,
casting a shadow upon tbe once brilliant
prospects of that historic party which iost
its power and its prestige wben its ablest
leaders were turned down by loud
mouthed iconoclasts.
Tillman's speech to-day was a rare speci
men of deoiagogism. He some time ago
achieved some reputation by a violent,
virulent, ungentlemaniy and unstates
manlike attack in the Senate of the United
States upon the Democratic party, and
has "made since then several other speeches
of an incendiary tenor. His language was
of such grossness tbat the ears of tbe
groundhogs were tickled, and he became
very popular with the corner- giocery
loafer element of the Democratic party in
the South.
Tillman is not in any sense a man of
large caliber. He is simply a demagogue.
He is a trimmer, whose harsh, high voice
echoes the execrations of the discontented,
and whose aggressive and unintellectual
countenance is seen in tbe van of every
lawless mob.
Much was expected of him to-day when
he appeared upon the platform for tbe
purpose of advocating tbe adoption of the
siiver plank, and he was greeted with en
thusiastic cheers from the West and South
as the champion, for the time being at
least, of the cause of the white metal.
It was expected that his address, forcible
and characteristic of an impulsive man,
vibrating with a certain overwhelming
energy, would be something which the
people away from tbe Ecene of battle and
witn nothing bet the cold type before
them could read at their leisure, digest
and approve. It was expected also tbat
in Senator Tiilman the Sunny South, the
land of chivalry, the home of gallant men
and fair women, would find an advocate
worthy alike of her people, her clime and
her glorious historr.
But what a disappointment it was.
Instead of the utterances of a well-bred,
high-minded gentleman, a scholar, a
statesman, a poet, such as the South in
her palmy days used to honor, tne con
vention was treated to a stump speech by
a man whose ideas might well be voiced
from the top of a flour barrel in front ot a
crops- roads grogÂ£err.
Magnanimity is of the statesman. No
brave soldier will strike the fallen foe.
But magnanimity was not Tillman's. He
not only struck the prostrate foe, but
gloried in the act. The greater part of
his speech was a coarse and uncalled-for
attack upon bis colleagues from New
York, who through rain and shine,
through peace and war, through victory
and defeat have stood shoulder to shoulder
with him and his, fighting manfully, for
what they considered to be the glorious
cause of Democracy. Instead of soothing
the lacerated feelings of a minority, sin
cere in their political belief; instead of
extending to them the hand of brother
hood, he spoke such words to and concern
ing them as were calculated to repel them
from the counsels of the party. He jeered
coarsely at the men from New York,
spoke slightingly of their political his
tory, of the sacrifices and heroic efforts
they had made in the past, and, like a
ward heeler, crowed exultingly over their
defeat. Then, with the note of a dema
gogue, he committed the unpardonable,
impolitic, nnstatesmanlike and ungentle
manly act of assailing in a National
Democratic Convention the President
whom the Democracy cf the United States
placed at the head of the Nation.
Here his boorishness became so appar
ent that he was hissed even by the South
ern delegates, and when be, plagiarizing
from Colonel John P. Irish, remarked
smartly that there were only three things
in the world that hissed, viz. : the goose,
the serpent and the man, he was hissed
again. The egotism of the man was ap
parent in every sentence that he uttered.
Whenever there were two roads, one lead
ing to reconciliation and harmony in tbe
party, the other to insult and humiliation,
Senator Tillman, with the instincts of a
political ruffian, took the road that led to
insult. Every word uttered by this fiery
demagogue served as a wed^e to split t;>e
Democratic party wide open.
After Tillman had been speaking about
thirty minutes be was hissed by the mag
nanimous men of the North, tbe noble
hearted men of the West, the cbivalric
men of he South, and ignored by the men
of the East with that silent contempt
which is ever the shield against that which
is beneath reply. Nevertheless, he pro
ceeded with his vituperation.
The respectable element of the conven
tion, which numbers more than two-thirds
of that body, ceased to pay any attention
to him; their disgust was exhibited by
thÂ«!ir inattention. They turned and con
versed with one another in loud tones.
Many left the hall, preferring a bite of even
a Chicago sandwich to remaining and
listening to the Tiilman flow of words. In
fact tbis inattention was so marked and
the hubbub of conversation became so
loud that both the sergeant-at-arms and
Acting Chairman Richardson felt obliged
to show the speaker the courtesy of rap
ping their gavels and imploring the con
vention to give the cheap South Carolinan
a silent if not a respectful hearing.
The star of Tillm&n set behind the horl
THE SAX FBAXCISCO CALL, FBIDAY, JLLV 10, iÂ»s*e.
zon to-day with his final bow. With his
closing sentence tbe idol of Carolina lay
broken, humiliated and disgraced in the
eyes of all honest Democrats, at the foot of
the flimsy pedestal on which it had been
reared. His remarks concerning the New
York delegation in particular and the New
York Democracy in general were resented
by every man in the convention who knew
and respected the patriotism, the ptrty
loyalty and the ability of such magnificent
men as Senator Hill and his colleagues,
whose names will go down in political his
tory long after that of Tillman shall hare
ceased to be even a memory. Tnere is a
feeling of justice and magnanimity sleep
ing at the base of every man's heart,
whether he be savage or civilized, and this
feeling was stirred into life by the rancor
ous words of Tillman of the evil eye.
When the gallant David Bennett Hill of
New York appeared upon the platform,
he wts greeted with a round of cheers and
with a spontaneous outburst of enthusi
asm, which must have cut deeply into tbe
pride of the South Carolinan who had
abused him. This outburst of applause was
intended and interpreted as a well
merited rebuke to demagogy, unman
liness and abuse, but the programme of
Boss Altgeld had to be followed to its logi
cal termination, and the speech of Tillman
went along with the hide and horns.
It was remarked to-day in conversation
by a delegate from the West that any
politician who gets up in a public, respect
able place and uses language unfit for a
gentleman) to utter will become famous for
a certain period among a certain class of
people. But such boors only run a very
short course; lire the rocket, they may be
brilliant when going up, but when coming
down, all that there is of them is a charred
stick.
I was very much disappointed in Sena- j
tor Tillman. I bad thought he was a sin- j
cere patriot suffering in secret for tne !
wrongÃ of bis people and manly enough to !
stand up in the Senate and denounce .
political corruption, even though it reeked j
on the threshold of the White House. But [
when I heard him to-day resurrect the
bloody shirt, attempt to reopen the old
wounds of the war, glonfy secession and
the firing upon tbe flag at Fort Sumter, I j

usual demonstrations held.
Bland was cheered to the echo, and a
scene of the wildest enthusiasm ensued
when Senator Vest mentioned his name at
the end of his nominating speech.
Bryan, suddenly injected into the list of
probable candidates by bis speech of the
morning, was put before tbe convention in
the maiden effort of Delegate H. T. Lewis
of Georgia, who established a reputation for
natural oratory in the few brief moments
he took for the purpose, and eg lai to tbe
demonstration for Bland was that which
followed tne Georgia delegate's address.
A girl in white, frantic in her enthusiasm
for Horace Boies, leaped to a chair in the
gallery and waved a Boies banner with
frenzied vehemence, and nearly every man
in tbe vast hall, whether from gallantry or
actual sympathy, rose and cheered with
a right good wilL
And when the pretty young woman,
swaying, jumping, clapping her hands
and giving vent to ncr emotion in divers

and spectators with the Boies standard
borne above her head, the audience caught
the full spirit of hex enthusiam and

ELOQUENCE AND UPROAR.
Tillman, Hill and Bryan Among:
Those to Attract the Greatest
Attention.
CONVENTION HALL, CHICAGO, 111.
July 9. â The delegates were clow in reach
ing Convention Hall this morninf, and it
was nearly 11 o'clock before the fail of the
gavel announced that another days ses
sion of tbe National Democratic Conven
tion had begun. There were at that time
mauy empty seats in tne part of the hall
reserved for the delegates, but the seats of
the spectators were ail occupied.
Before tbe convention was called to or
der the principal subject of interest was
the announcement that the committee on
platform had added to the platform a
strong plank against tb* A. P. A., and de
claring that every citizen of the United
States is entitled to civil and religious
liberty.
There was considerable discussion, too,
as to tbe probability of a bolt, for it was
recognized that if a bolt was to come it
would come to-day.
State Senator Grady of New York, after
taking his seat among the New York dele
gates, said to a representative of the
United Press: "It is practically agreed
among the New York delegates to express
no decided opinion as a body upon the J
deliberations of this convention. We will ;
return home silently, will hold an early
Bute Convention, and will tnere decide
what we shall do."
Although tbe platform had been almost i
completed yesterday the committee on !
resolutions went into session shortly be- j
fore 10 o'clock this morning to put the fin j
iÃhin* touches to it. Neither Senator Hill, j
ex-Governor Russell nor any of the pronii- I
vent gold leaders on tbe committee were !
at the meeting when it was called to order. â 
About two-ihirds of the members were
present. Senator Hill entered the com
mittee-room at 10 o'clock.
It was just 10:52 when the chairman
called tbe convention to order.
Senator White of California, permanent '
chairman, called the assembly to order.
Prayer was offered by Rev. Thorn at E. J
Green, who offered prayer yesterday. Rep- '
resentative Richardson of Tennessee was
then called to the chair.
Senator Jones of Arkansas presented the
report of the committee on platform Â«nd i
tbe various points in the platform were !
enthusiastically cheered as they were read. â 
When the Cubun plank was reached i
some one in tbe front aisle unfurled tbe !
flag and waved it Tbis effort at theatri- i
cal effect was promptly suppressed by the !
chairman, who rapped" sharply and com- i
manded the sergeant at-arms to "Haul |
down tnat flag." which was immediately
done and the incident was brought to an '
ignominious close.
The platform is substantially as prepared !
yesterday. j
Senator Hill presented a minority report j
Farmer Bland Yet Leads.
"THE CALL'S" HEADQUARTERS, )
GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL, I
CHICAGO, ILL., JULY 10, 1:30 A. M. )
Bland is still in the lead for the Presidential nomination at this hour. When
the history-making convention of the National Democracy adjourned at 12-30 o'clock
last night until 10 o'clock tbis morning the cool and calculating beads saw no change
in the situation, save the wonderful strength of Bryan of Nebraska. They realized,
however, that his strength was with the galleries, not with the delegations.
Bryan hynotized the convention by his magnificent oratorical display of veter
day afternoon during the debate on the platform. The indescribable demonstration
that followed his outburst of passion and invective was greater than the ovation that
greeted the reception of his being placed in nomination at the later session.
Will Bryan succeed? is a question that the delegates are sleeping on to-night.
Bland will have a large majority on the first ballot to-day, but not sufficient to nom
inate him under the two-thirds rule. *
Stevenson was not named by Illinois. His boom, however, i 3 growing and his
name will be presented later, if the East accepts him as a compromise candidate.
The New York delegation dined with Whitney at the Washington Park Club
house, which is within a few blocks of the Coliseum, during the recess of the conven
tion last night It was decided not to bolt. A steering committee was appointed,
however, and its plan of campaign is withheld from tbe public
The night session of the convention was picturesque and demonstrative.
Delegates and visitors seem exhausted after the labors and excitement of the day
and are now seeking their couches in the big hotels.
Balloting for candidates for Presidential nomination will begin immediately on
the reassembling of the convention this morning. Fra>-k McGciee.
from the committee on resolutions, which
condemns free coinage of silver, and de
mands that ail money be kept on a parity
with gold. Another plank indorses the
administrarion of Cleveland. Both these
planks were enthusiastically cheered, es
pecially the latter. Many of the delegates
and the larger part of the audience sprang
to their feet ana waved bats and handker
chiefs, while the cheenne and applause
showed that Cleveland bad not yet lost all
his popularity.
T wo amendments were then read by
Senator Hill as follows:
First amendrrent: "But it should be
carefully provided by law that any change
in the monetary standard should not ap
ply to existing contracts."
Second amendment: "Our advocacy of
the independent and free coinage of silver
being based on tbe belief that such coin
age will affect and maintain a parity be
tween gold and silver at the ratio of 16 to
1, we declare and pledge our sincerity that
if such frie coinage shall fail to effect such
parity within one year from its enactment
by law, such coinage shall thereupon be
suspended."
Senator Tillman of South Carolina was
the first speaker in favor of the majority
report. When he ascended the platform
he was greeted with cheers and hisses. He
began by referring to the way in which
the "lying" newspapers bad misrepre
sented him when they called him the
"pitchfork man" from South Carolina,
and said that he came from the Secession.
He denounced these statements as an in
sult to South Carolina. They were there,
he said, to inaugurate a war to liberate
the white slaves. He did not know
"whether he could be looked on as the rep
resentative of the whole South.
His listeners seamed to have the same
doubt, for there were many cries of "No,
no," and much confusion.
Tillman resumed: "We have been the
hewers of wood and drawers of water in
bondage to the States of New York, Con
necticut and New Jersey. This is purely
a sectional issue."
The speaker was here interrupted by
cheers and titses, the hisses predomi
nating. The speaker stood until silence
bad been restored and then said that the
facts would never be changed by hissing.
He asked if New York and Pennsylvania
had got their great increase of wealth in
the last decade honestly â an increase
greater than that of twenty-five of the
Western and Southern States in the same
period of time. The South has no angry
feelings of resentment for the wrongs it
has endured.
Here tbe speaker was interrupted by im
patient shouts from the galleries of
"Time," "Time," but he went on without
paving attention to them. He said that
the sectionalism was between tbe people
and the great money oligarchy of the East
and asked, "Where is tLe New York leader
now?'
This question again excited the galleries
and was greeted with laughter, cheers and
nisses. Then one man called out, as an
answer. "In the toup!" Another called
for Herr Most. And then there were cries
throughout the audience for Hill, and for
a while confusion reigned. Tillman be
came angry as the confusion increased,
and said that he would have his say if he
had to stand there until sundown.
Finally, when quiet was restored, he
said that tbe New York Senator would
have bis turn on tbe platform. Hill bad
forced the present issue and would have a
chance to explain his reasons.
To indorse the administration of Presi
dent Cleveland would be to write them
selves a.->cs and liars. He spoke of the
bond syndicate and denounced Cleveland
for overriding his oath and invading tbe
State of Illinois with Government troops.
Cleveland has been the death of the Dem
ocratic party as far as he could be.
He offered a substitute to the Hill reso
lution, a resolution which read as follows:
"We denounce the administration of Pres
ident Cleveland as nn-Democraiic and
tyrannical and as a departure from those
principles prized by all liberty-loving
Americans; tbe veto power used to thwart
tbe will of the people as expressed by their
representatives in Congress; appointive
power used to subsidize press, debauch Con
gress, overawe and control citizens in tbe
free exercise ot their constitutional rights
as voters, and tbe plutocratic despotism
thus sought to be established on the ruins
of the Republic.
"We repudiate the construction placed
on the financial plank ot tbe last Demo
cratic National Convention by President
Cleveland and Secretary Carlisle as con
trary to the plain meaning of English
words and as being acts of bad faith de
serving the severest censure; tbe issue of
bonds in time of peace with which to buy
gold to red em the coin obligations pay
able in silver or gold, and tbe use of the
proceeds to defray the ordinary expenses
of the Government as unlawful usurpa
tions of authority deserving impeach
ment,"
When Tillman bad finished he was fol
lowed by Senator Jones of Arkansas, who,
of course, spoke in favor of the majority
report. This was not, he said, a question
of section. He loved tbe whole of this
great country and would lay down his life
for it. He loved it beyond ail question of
sectionalism. They were now engaged in
an effort to restore the liberties of their
fathers.
His reference to tbe John Sherman and
Cleveland republicanism was greeted with
laughter and cheers. He said that they
had repudiated sin in the platform, but
had not mentioned tbe sinner. He de
nounced Cleveland as un-Democratic and
tyrannical, and offered an amendment to
the platform to that effect. He denounced,
moreover, the issue of bonds in time of
peace as a usurpation of authority deserv
ing impeachment.
As he left the platform he was greeted ,
with mingled cheers and hisses, and the
convention was a scene of confusion until
Hill of New York made his appearance.
David B. Hill mounted the platform to
speak for the substitute plank and a scene
that approached in entnusiasm that of
last night, wh*n New York cast her sev
enty-two votes for the minority report of
the credentials committee, began. Dele
gates stood on chairs and waved hats,
fans and handkerchiefs. Mr. Wnitney
rose with the rest and the sight of his
erect figure brought many to their feet
The galleries seemed to rise as a man and
the waving sea of hats, newspapers and
everything at hand that could be made
conspicuous rose and fell all over the hall.
The attempts of the chair to still the
tumult were unavailing, and although
most of the delegates resumed their seats
after several minutes of cheering, the
galleries would not be quiet and yelled
and shouted with hearty good will.
At this time the object of the demon
stration stood cool, facing bis enthusiastic
friends. He showed no feeling in facial
expression, and glanced straight ahead.
Then gradually the tumult ended and
fiually silence reigned. Mr. Hill began in
slow and distinct tones, saying that, fol
lowing the course of tbe Senator from
South Carolina, he would introduce him
self by sayinp, "I am a Democrat, but I am
not a revolutionist." [Cheers.]
Without intending to especially reply to
the remarks of the distinguished Senator
from South Carolina, be would only say
that it was a waste of time for him to
assume that we were so ignorant as not to
know that it was South Carolina that in
1860 attempted to destroy the Union. His
[Hill's] mission here to-day was to build
up, not to destroy.
He knew he addressed a convention that
did not agree with all the views he held;
but he knew they would hear him for his
cause. New York made no apoloey to
South Carolina. [Cheers.] She did not
need it. Need he remind this great con
vention that it was New York City whose
wealth had been so decried that had al
ways been the Gibraltar of Democracy.
He assertAd this proposition: That the
Democratic party stood to-day in favor of
gold and silver as the money for the con
stitution, and not for gold or silver alone,
bat differed as to the means that should
be employed to attain their end. One side
favored the co-operation of other nations.
It was not a question of courage. It was
a question of business, a question of
economics. He believed it was wise to
seek the co-operation of other nations. He
did not assail the honesty of those who
differed with him. He had always treated
the free coinage men respectfully and
would do so to-day.

He took it for granted that this conven
tion was in favor of maintaining the silver
dollar od a parity with every other dollar,
but the platform said not a word aOout
this. Everything was risked on free coin
age. Could the American people, no mat
ter how brave they might be, make copper
or lead the equal of gold? It was a ques
tion, as he had said, of economics, and
therefore in the- opinion of the minority
tbe safest course was to advocate inter
national monometalism and stop there.
The criticism was made that the minority's
plank was similar to that of the Republi
can party. He did not think it much the
worse for that. The Monroe plank, the
Cuban, the pension and the civil service
planks were all equally like the Eepubli
ban planks. He did not like many of the
planks in the Democratic platform, and
he thought it' the wise counsels of the
Senator ftom Arkansas had pre
vailed it would have been different. There
lore, when that Senator said the platform
meant what it saiil and said what it means,
he would like some one to explain v.nat
was meant by the plank about the issue
of paper money in the future. Was this
an attempt at this late day to commit the
Democratic party to the suicidal policy of
issuing paper money ?
Further he did not believe it wise to
introduce new tests of Democracy. What
was the necessity of making an income
tax a test of Democratic faith ? Had it
come to this, he asked, that tbe followers
of Tliden, who all his life opposed this
iniquitous tax, were now required as a test
of their Democracy to express their belief
in tbe constitutionality of an income tax?
Was it wise, he asked, to attack the Su
preme Court of your country? [Cheers.l
"Will some one tell me," he continued,
"what that clause means in this- platform ?
If you mean what you say and say wiiat
you mean, that plank meansâ if it means
anythingâ that it is the duty of Congress
to reconstruct the Supreme Court of the
country. I will not lollow any such revo
lutionary step as that" [Cheers.]
Then he asked if they bad not trouble
enough without putting in all these un
necessary and foolish things. What more
have you done?
"You have for the first time," he said,
"assailed in a Democratic platform the
doctrine of oar father*, of A life tenure for
our Judges. How foolish to insert that
provision."
Still more foolish, he contended, was the
condemnation of tbe issue of bonds. Tbat
meant the repeal of the resumption act
and repudiation. 'Cheers.] The state
ment implied that not even Congress bad
tbe power to do this. The statement was
too broad; it must be a surprise to some
of his Democratic friends in the Senate
who had introduced bi'.is to authorize the
issue of bonds for the Nicaragua canal and
ctUer purposes, [daughter and applause.]
He summarized the results which would
have followed if the President bad not
made use of tne authority conferred -upon
him and issued bonds. Speaking of the
deficit of flfiv millions which had arisen
because a tariff bill passed by the Demo
cratic party had not 'as y?t' (as he said
with emphasis) yielded enough revenue
for the necessities of the Government.
This was a foolish issue to have raised. It
put the Democratic party on the defensive
in every >chool district in the country.
The burden imposed upon the Eastern
States by this silver plank was all they
could reasonably be expected to carry
without imposing on them all the addi
tional issues. He did not believe in driv
ing men out of tbe Democratic arty
[cheers] to make room for a lot of Re
publicans and Whigs and Populists who
have never voted the Democratic ticket in
their lives. [Load cheers.]
"I tell you," he added impressively, "no
matter who your candidate may be, with
one exception, your Populist friends will
nominate their own .ticket and your forces
will be divided.'' [Loud applause.]
A voice back in the ball cried ">"â â¢."
Turning in that direction Mr. Hill said
with bitter intonation: "My friend says
'No.'" Then raisin? his voice to its full
pitch, he asked: "Who is there to speak
for the Populists in a Democratic conven
tion?" [Cheers, renewed again &nd
again.] .
Senator Hill brought his speech to a
close by a recapitulation of the defects^l
found in the platform, and said there was
still time to remedy them in part.
As he returned to his delegation he was
cheered as no other speacer bad been since
the opening of the convention. The dem
onstration over Senator Hill was at its
height when Senator Vilas ascended the
platform to support his colleague's argu
ment, and his appearance there was lost
sight of in the general confusion. Mr.
Hill's progress to his place among the
New York delegation was a series of hand
shaking.
Even after the cheering had ceased it
was some time before order could be ob
tained.
Mr. Viias was applauded as he was in
troduced. The reasons for the minority
were presented, he said, with a recogni
tion that they constituted a protest
against the proposed attempt at party
revolution. If the majority persisted in
its revolutionary methods they were sure
to meet a fearful penalty. Tbis platform
would not produce bimetallism. It was in
direct contrast to the platform of 1892,
which proposed honest bimetallism. It
would shrink.not swell.our currency. The
silver dollar was no new thing to the
United States : the scheme of silver mono
metallism was no new thing to the United
States. Tne Act of 1834 was the real Demo
cratic measure; it was created under
Democratic leadership. That was dis
tinctly a gold measure. The gold stand
ard was now accused of responsibility for
ail the prevailing evils, but it was never so
credited when prices rose."
"Would you," he asked, "stop tbe change
< f prices, stop enterprise, prevent trans
portation ? Take from the farmer tbe
mower and reaping machine, wheat would
rise. Do such things as these and they
would soon relieve you of this curse of
civilization."
Mr. Vilas told of the changes in wages
and prices during the decade just past.
The foreign debt was pledged to be paid
in gold, and for every foreign debtor a
creditor would be injured â oue of our own
people. He protested against tbe assump
tion that this was a nation of dishonest
debtors. [Applause.] In the language of
Lincoln, "you may fool all tbe people
some of the time; you may fool some of
the people all the time, but you cannot
fool aii of the people all of the time."
[Laughter and applause.]
He solemnly protested that should this
scheme ever win it would result in uni
versal distress; if it should ever come
about it would result in direct calamity.
If that calamity ever came, let us remem
ber who were its authors. He appealed to
the Southern Democrats to desist In their
attempt to bring about a change in civiliza
tion at which the whole world stands
aghast.
Cheers for Vilas as he concluded were
intermingled with cries of "Russeli," and
the ex-Governor of Massachusetts was
given a hearty welcome as he began to
speak. The time had passed, he said, for
debate on the merits cf this issue. He
was conscious, painfully conscious, that
the mind of this convention was not and
had not been open to conviction. He
knew tbat the policy which jiggled down
rights and invaded the sovereignty of
fctates was to be rigidly enforced. But tbe
country, if not this convention, would
listen to the higher protest. [Cheers.]
He spoke, and he bad a right to speas, for
the Democracy of his com monwealtn. He
had seen it in its darkest days following
the principles of Democracy with an abid
ing faith, and they lived to see the day
when for three successive years they bad
seen the banners of Democracy trium
phant in Massachusetts over the cohorts
of Republican protection. This was on
great National issues. He did not believe
he should have lived to nee the day when
three great principles would be forgotten
in a Democratic convention and they
should be invited under new and radical
leadership and a new and radical policy,
at the demand of a section, on the ground
of expediency, to adopt a policy which he
and those who thought with him believed
meant dishonor and disaster. [Cheers and
applause.]
Then Governor Russell paid his respects
to George Fred Williams. He said: "In
these debates I have heard one false note
from the commonwealth of Massachusetts.
1 answer him not in anger but in sorrow,
and I appeal to you, my fellow delegates,
and ask. Do I or do I not speak the senti
ments of my State? [Loud cries of 'Yes.']
Do I speak the sentiments of my State
when I say they and we utter our earnest
and unflinching protest against this Dem
ocratic platform ? [Cheers.] Let me, fol
lowing the example of the Senator from
South Carolina, utter a prophecy. When
this storm has subsided and the dark
clouds of passion and prejudice have worn
away and there comes a sober second
thought of the people, then the protest of
the minority here will be held as the nrk
of the covenant of the Faith [cheer?],
where all Democrats will be united and
go forth to fight for the ol I principles and
carry them to triumphal victory.
Cheer after cheer went up as Bryan of
Nebraska, tali, emooth-faced, youthful
looking, leaped up the platform steps,
two at a time, to close the debate. Ban
ners waved from the free silver delega
tions, and handkerchiefs, newspapers,
hats, fans and canes were brought into
play by tbe entbnsiaatic crowd. At one
time tne applause became deafening, and
could not be suppressei by Mr. Ricbard
son, who was still acting as temporary
cr.airraan. When quiet had been restored
Mr. Bryan began speaking clearly and de
lioerateiy. T. c beiief in the honor of a
righteous cause was stronger than the pre
dictions of disaster. He would move to
lay on tbe table the resolutions in con
demnation of the administration. [Cheers.]
This was not a question tha< permitted
descent into personalities. ThU bad been
a great coo test. Never before had so
great an issue been fou*bt oat. Ha
sketched the growth of the free silver idea
in the Democratic ranks, and toid
zeal that had been injected into the party
contest. The siiver men had gone forth
to victory after victory, and were as
sembled now not to condemn, not to pro
test, but to enter up a judgment ordered
by the people. As individuals, he said,
those whom he represented might have
been willing to compliment the gentle
man from New York (Mr. Hill), but they
were unwilling to put him io a position
where he could thwart tbe will of the
Democratic party. -[Cheers.]
He claimed for his people that they were
the equals of the peo; Ie of Massachusetts
[cheers], and when the people of Massa
chusetts came to the people of Nebraska
and said, "You have disturbed our busi
ness," tbe people of Nebraska replied to
t c people of Massachusetts, 'You have
disturbed our business." [Applause.]
"We say," he continued, "you have
made too limited an application of the
definition of the word "business man.'
The man employed for wages is as much a
business man as hisemployer. [Applause.]
The farmer wno goes out to toil in the
morning is as much a business man as
the man who goes on the Board of Trade
to gamble in stocks. [Cheers.] The miner
is as much a business man as the few
financial magnates who in a back room
corner the money of the world. [Great
cbeerine. ',
Mr. Bryan said those represented were
tired of submitting to tbe burdens which
oppressed them. ''We beg no longer, we
petition no more, we defy them.'' This
denunciation uttered in Mr. Bryan's most
dramatic manner was followed by a scene
of wiid excitement and cheering, which
lasted several minutes.
"What we need," Bryan continued "is
an Andrew Jackson, to stand as Andrew
JacXÃon stood against tne National bank*.
We are toid that our platform is made to
catch votes. We reply to them that
changed conditions make new issuer Tbe
principles on which Democracy rests are
as everlasting as the hills, but they must
be applied to new conditions as they arise.
"New conditions have arisen and we are
attempting to meet them. They tell us
that the income-tax question ought not
to be brought in here; that it is a new
idea. They find fault with us for our
criticism of the Supreme Court of the
United States. We have not criticized it.
We have simply called attention to it. If
you, want a criticism of tee court in the
matter of the income tax read the dis
senting opinions of the Judges.
"They say that we passed aa unconsti
tutional law. I deny it. The income tax
was not unconstitutional when it wect be
fore tbe Supreme Court for the first time.
It did not become unconstitutional until
one juuge changed his mind and we can
not be expected to know when a judge
will change his mind. [Cheers and laugh
ter.] The income tax is a just law and I
am in favor of it. [Applause.] And when
I find a man who is not willing to pay his
share of the burdens of the Government
which protects him I find a man who is
unworthy to enjoy the blessings of a Gov
ernment like ours, [ixmd cheers/
"They say that we are opposing the Na
tional bank currency. It is true. Thomas
Benton said that in searching history he
could find but one parallel to Andrew
Jackson, that when Cicero destroye :
conspiracy of Cataline and saved Rome be
did for Rome what Jackson did *ie -.
he destroyed the bank' conspiracy and
saved America. We say in onr platform
that tbe right to coin and issue money is
a function of Government. We believe
that tbat power of sovereign y can no
more with safety be dele ated to private
corporations than the power to enact
penal statutes or levy taxation.
"Mr. Jefferson, who was once regarded
as good Democratic authority, seems to
have had a different opinion from the
Senator from New York. They tell us
that tne issuance of paper money is the
function of tanks and that the Govern
ment ought to go our of the banking busi
ness. I stand with Jefferson and tell them
as he did tbat the hsue of money is a
function of government and that the
banks ought to go out of tbe governing
business. [Cneers and laughter.]
"The Senator from New York says he
will offer an amendment providing* that,
tne proposed change of law shall not affect
contracts already made. Let me inform
him that that is not the intention where
under present law contracts are made pay
able in gold. But if he means to say that
we cannot change our monetary system
witnout protecting those who have loaned
money before tbe change is made, I want
to ask him where. :n law or in morals, he
can find authority for not protecting the
debtors when the act of 1373 was passed.
"Tb* Senator from New York also aaks
about tbe consequence of a failure to main
tain parity. My reply is that we cannot
couple the platform with a doubt as to our
own sincerity. He says he wants this

Why does he not tell us what he is going
to do if they fail to secure it ? [Applause
and laughter.] They have tried for twenty
years to secure an international agreement
for bimetallism and those wno are waiting
for it most patiently do not want it at all.
[Applause and laughter.]
"It they ask why it is that we say more
on the money question tban on the tariff
question, we reply that if protection has
slain its thousands the gold standard has
slain its tens ol thousands. [Cheers.] If
they ask us wby not embody ia the plat
form all those things that we believe, my
reply is tbat when we have restored the
money of the constitution all other neces
sary reforms will be possible, and 'that
until that is done there is no reform that
can be accomplished. [Cheers.]
"Why is it that, within three months,
such a change has come over the senti

Manufacturers. 60Â» Sacramoutea*U was confidently asserted that those who
believe in the gold standard would form a
platform and nominate and elect a candi
date, and they had good reason for the
assertion. Because there is scarcely a
State here to-day asking for a gold stan- j
dard that is not within the absolute con- I
trol of the Republican party. Mr. Me- j
Kinley was nominated at St. Louis on a
platform which declares for the mainte
nance of the gold standard until it shall
be changed into bimetallism by interna
tional agreement. Mr. McKinley was the
most popular man among the Repub
licans, and three months ago everybody
in the Republican party prophesied his
election.
"How is it to-day? That man who used
to boast that he looks like Napoleon
[lautrhter] shudders to-day when he thinks
ti at he was nominated on the anniver
sary of the battle of Waterloo. [Cheers.l
He can fancy that he hears in the distance
the pound of the waves as they beat on the
lonely shores of St. Helena. [Cheers.]
Why this chance? Ah, my friends, the
change is evident to any one who looks at
the matter. It is because no private char
acter, however pure, no personal popular
iiv, however great, can protect from the
avenging wrath of an indignant people.
The man who would declare that he is in
favor of foisting the gold standard on this
people or who is willing to surrender the
right of self-governmeut and to place
legislative control in the hands of foreign
potentates and powers cannot hope for an
eleciicn to the Presidency of the United
States.
â¢We go forth,' said the orator, 'confi
dent that we shall win. Why? Because
there i> not a spot of ground upon which
the advocates of the gold standard can
meet as. You tell us the great cities are
in favor of the gold standard. Burn down
your cities and leave our farms and your
cities will prow up again. But destroy
our farms and the grass will grow in every
city ot the Union. [Great cheering.]
"My friends,' 1 he continued, "we shall
declare that this Nation is able to legislate
for its people upon every question without
waiting for the consent of any other na
tion on earth, and upon that issue we
expect to carry every State in this conn
try. [Great cheers.] It is the issue of
177H over again. Our ancestors, when only
3,090,000 in number, declared their inde
pendence of every nation on earth. Shall
we, when grown to 70.000,000, have less
courage? If they say we cannot have bi
metallism until some other nation assists,
w<- reply. We will restore bimetallism and
let England adopt it because the United
St -ties has led the way. [Cheers.] We
siiH.ll answer their demand for the gold
s::ind;Â»rd by saying to them: 'You shall
â ress down upon the brow of labor
this crown of thorns. You shall not
crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.'
[Tremendous cheering.]
Then ensued perhaps the most extraor
dinary scene ol this extraordinary conven
tion. As if by the magic touch of a wand,
delegation after delegation rose in solid
phalanx and cave vent to the most enthu
siastic demonstration in honor of the Ne
braska orator. Everybody stood up, even
the Eastern men, who at first were dis
posed to remain in their seats. Western
er- shouted, waved handkerchiefs, hats,
canes, umbrellas and anything else
conspicuous and portable. Deafening
cheers rent the air and articles of every de
scription were thrown high above the
surging sea of humanity. The staffs bear
ing the names of the States were held aloft
v,\th flaes and other things on top and
waved to and fro. When that pastime be
"r.mÂ« too tame, led by Delegate Gatewood j
of Texas, nearly all of the silver States and
Territories and some gold States joined in
a procession, bearing the State poles, and
marched in triumph around the floor.
Some of the Eastern States' kept their
si ustaffs in their places and confined their
expressions to standing up and giving a
miM cheer as individuals.
This furore continued for a quarter of
an hour, and no efforts were made by the
chairman or sergeant-at-arms to check its
tempestuous progress. Away to the west
and north and the south of the platform
in the multitude of spectators the demon
stration of the delegates was repeated.
Hundreds of umbrellas were opened by
apparently crazed people. Harmless mis
siles of paper and other things were
hurled through the air on delegates' heads.
The remarkable feature of this wild out
break was that its spontaneity was appar
ent, and it was Â«o much a personal tribute
to Bryan that Eastern delegates who dif
fered from him caught the infection and
joined in moderately. Nebraska's delega
tion was the cynosure of observation, and
the smooth-faced silver champion who
had electrified the convention sat un
moved in his seat at the edge of the aisle
opposite his opponent from New York,
Senator Hill.
Whf r, some degree of quiet was restorad
tlic previous question was ordered on the
pratferm and all amendments. Mr. Hill
requested a call of States on his proposed
financial plank, and at 3:15 the voting be
gan upon Mr. Hill's proposed substitut
for the free-coinage plank. It resulted:

Mr. Hill's two financial amendments
were then voted down viva voce. Mr.
Tillman rose to ask the parliamentary
status of his amendment condemning tbe
administration. The chair replied that it
was still pending if the gentleman desired
to press it. Mr. Tillman replied that as
the failure to indorse was equivalent to a
vote of censure he withdrew his amend
ment.

The official declarations of Georgia and
Louisiana in favor of Bryan for the nom
ination caused rumors galore, and reports
fairly flew about that other States would
Jail into the Bryan column. Illinois was
mentioned as one of these. Governor
AitEeid denied the rumor, however, say
ine: "It is absolutely untrue. Illinois
has already declared in favor ol Mr.
Bland."
The friends of Mr. Bryan left the con
vention hall at recess confident of nom
inating their man, and if appearances
count for anything they were certainJy
justified in their enthusiasm for him.
AT THE EVENING SESSION.
Statesmen Grow Eloquent In Plac
ing the Various Candidates In
Nomination.
CHICAGO, 111., July 9.â The masses of
spectators at this evening's session were,
if possible, denser and the excitement
more intense than at any previous session
of the convention, because the crisis of the
nominating speeches arid the balloting for
Presidential candidates had arrived. There
was not a vacant seat outside of the sec
tions for delegates and alternates at 8
o'clock, the hour to which the recess ex
tended, and still the crowds kept pouring
in as though the supply of tickets was in
exhaustible and the capacity of the spa
cious and magnificent hall could not be
put to too severe a test. The illumination
by electric lamps was perfect but the heat
stifling.
The New York delegation held a caucus
before coming to the convention hall and
discussed the best steps to take in this
evening's programme. It was decided to
come to the hall and take their seats, but
not to take part in the balloting. They
also decided not to bolt the convention.
The convention was called to order at
8:30 p.m. by its presiding officer, Senator
White of California, who immediately
handed over the gavel to Representative
Richardson of Tennessee, who acted as
president pro tern. this evening as well as
during the morning session.
It took the sergeant-at-arms and his
assistants fully ten minutes to allay the
uproar and confusion and to obtain even a
tolerable degree of order, and even that
lasted for only a very brief interval, for
every moment, on one pretense or another,
the crowds broke out with cheering.
The chairman informed the convention
that the roll of States would now be called
so the nominations of the candidates for
the Presidency could be made. By an
agreement entered into by the friends of
j the several candidates, the chairman
j added, tha nominating and seconding
speeches would be confined to thirty
minutes in length, which time might be
used either when the nominations were
made or when the State ol the speaker was
called.
Senator Vest of Missouri was the first
delegate to ascend the platform, even be
fore the call of States had got further in
the alphabetical iist than the State of
Arkansas.
Mr. Vest spoke as follows:
Resolution? do not begin with the rich and
prosperous. They represent the protest of
those who are suffering from political condi
tion* and whose demands for relief are de
nounced by the beneficiaries of unjust and op
pressive-legislation.
When a profound sense of wrong, evolved
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
Dr. Milliniux and \\\s Oregon. Friends Shouting for ex-Qov>ernor
Svj Wester p'ennoyer.
from yean of distress, fastens upon the public
mind in a free country, and the people are de
termined to have redress, a leader is always
found who is a platform in himself and to
whom they instinctively turn as the logical
exponent of their hopes.
The people are not iconoclasts nor false to
their convictions. They followed Jefferson
when he assailed the centralizing and mon
archical doctrines of the old Federalists and
was denounced as a communist and leveler by
the wealth and culture of New England and
New York. They followed Jackson when he
took the United States Bank by the throat and
was proclaimed a tyrant and ruffian by the
usurers and money kings. They followed Lin
coln when he attacked the slave power nnd de
clared that this country could not exist "hall
slave and half free."
The great movement for bimetallismâ the
free and unlimited coinage of gold and silver
at a ratio of 16 to Iâ and the restoration of sil
ver to its constitutional status is "no sapling
chance-sown by the fountain, blooming at
springtime, in winter to fade."
It Uas come to stay. It is a protest against
the wrong and outrage of 1873, when, without
debate and with the knowledge of only a few
men in Congress, the silver dollar was stricken
from the coinage and the red despot of gold
made supreme as to all values. It is a declara
tion by the free men of America that the
United States must withdraw from the con
spiracy which was formed to destroy one-half
the metallic money of the world, in order to
establish the slavery of greed and usury, more
degrading than the tyranny of armed forces.
It is the stern demand from unrequited toil,
bankrupt enterprise and ruined homes, for a
change in the money system which lor years
has brought disaster and desolation.
In this crisis of our country and party we
must take no step backward in platform nor
candidate. We want no uncertain nor doubt
ful leader. "No laggard in peace or dastard in
war." No latter-day sliver saint, but a griz
zled and scarred veteran if ho has borne the
heat and burthen of the day and whose breast
is marked irom edge of sword and point of
lance en a hundred fields. Twenty years ago
the buttle for silver was begun in the halls of
Congress by a modest, unpretending, brave
man, not an iridescent or 'meteoric statesman,
but of the people and from the people, who has
never faltered for an instant in the great strug
gle. Others doubted And wavered, some
yielded to blandisnment and patronace, and
are now holding office under the gold power;
others misrepresented their constituents and
have been provided for in the Katianal in
firmary of the present administration, but
Richard Parks Bland stands now where he
stood then, the living, breathing embodiment
of the silver cause.
He struck with steel point the golden shield
of the money monopolists as did I van hoe that
of the proud templar In the lists atAshby,
and has neither asked nor given quarter.
Noris he a narrow, one-idea man. For twenty
years in Congress he fought in the front ranks
for Democratic principles and policies as taueht
by Jefferson. He stood by the side of Riindali
and risked health and life to defeat the first
force bill. He opposed ably and earnestly that
crowning tariff infamy, the McKinley act, and
was again among the foremost opponents of the
last force bill, which passed the House but was
defeated in the Senate. He introduced the nrst
free-coinage measure in Congress and was the
author of the seigniorage bill, which passed
both nouses and was vetoed by President
Cleveland. If this be an obscure record, where
can be found the career of any public servant
which deservei the plaudits of his country
men?
The Democrats o! Missouri, who have passed
through the fiery furnace of Republican pro
scription seven times heated, and whose State
flae has always been placed beneath the great
oriftamme of the National Democracy, make no
apology nor excuse when offering such a can
didate for the Presidency.
If it is "whence comes our candidate?" we
answer: "Not from the usuer'g den. nor temple
of Mammon, where the clink of gold drowns
the voice of patriotism, but from the farm, the
workshop, the mineâ from the hearts and
homes of the people."
To reject him is to pot a brand upon rugged
honesty and undaunted courage and to chill
the hearts and hopes of those who during all
these years have waited for this hour of
triumoh. To nominate him is to make our
party agaih that of the people, and to insure
success
Give us Silver Dick and silver quick,
And we will make McKinley sick
In the Ides of next November.
The voice of the Missouri Senator, never
at any time very robust, was quite lost in
the vastness of the hall. His mention of
inland's name was followed by only a very
slight demonstration of applause not half
so loud as the clamor of the delegates
fighting their way into the convention.
Mr. Com stork of Rhode Island com
plained to the chair that he had been
almost "torn to pieces" in forcing his way
in through the force of police. A similar
complaint was made by delegates from
New York, and instructions were given to
the sergeant-at-arms to remedy the evil.
The chairman and the sergeant-at-arms
appeared to be utterly unable to cope with
the situation, and Mr. Vest went on with
bis speech nominating Mr. Bland. The
only part of his speech that stirred the
crowd was the closing rhyme:
Give ns Silver Dick
And silver quick.
And we will make McKinley sick.
This brought down the bouse and bats
and flags were waved amid a great uproar
which lasted for some minutes. The band
came to the help of the crowd, striking up
"The Battle-cry of .Freedom." All tho
silver delegates rose to their feet, cheered
and indulged in all the usual manifesta
tions of popular enthusiasm, so tbat what
at first was but a faint wave of applause
grew into a tumultuous storm in the thick
of which a Bland banner was carried
through the hall with the motto:
.. â  : ,â¢â  â 
A band of music at either end of the hall
added to the uproar, while the official band
struck up amid great applause "The Red,
White and Blue," putting the rival musi
cians to silence. By this time there were
three handsome silver Bland banners un
rolled and carried about with a likeness of
the candidate and the motto. "Free Silver,
Free People," "One God, One Country,
One Bland," "Blandâ Silver's Invincible,
Irrepressible, Irreproachable Champion."
Meantime several of the silver delegates
got into the aisles and jumped erratically
in time with the music. Thii scene lasted
for fully twelve minutes.
The nomination of Mr. Bland was sec
onded by David Overmyer of Kansas, who
spoke of him as "an illustrious statesman
and a peerless Gracchus â 'Silver Dick'
Bland."
He lauded Mr. Bland as a man who knew
that money which was made from either of
the precious metals was sound money, as
tested by the experience and wisdom of all
the sages of the party; an American who
knew that the money of the constitution
was honest money; tftat the money which
was good enough to v&f. private debts was
good enough to pay every public debt, and
tbat the money which was good enough to
pay George Washington when fighting the
battles of liberty was cood enough to pay
Ickelheimer, Morgan or any other man.
[Cheers and laughter.]
Mr. Bland was a man who knew the
short and simple annals of the poor, who
plowed his own fields, turned the stub
born elebe and stirred the fertile soil of
his farm. [Applause.]
"Fellow citizens," Mr. Overmyer contin
ued, "the eyes of the world are upon you.
The great heart of humanity beats in anx
ious expectation of the issue of this the
greatest convention ever held on the
American continent. By the ashes of
your ancesto.s, by the heroic memories of
all the glorious and immortal dead, I ap
peal to you to solve this great issue aright.
Tnere is one name which itself is a solu
tion. Bland. Bland, Biand." [Cheers.]
Hon. J. 8. Williams of Illinois also sec
onded the nomination of Bland, speaking
of him as a man who had done more than
any other American for the restoration of
silver. He spoke of having served with
Bland six years in Congress and his dem
onstrated intelligence and statesmanship.
It was true he had not tve eloquence of
Webster, but his statements of public
questions were always clear and able, and
his twenty 3 r ears in Congress had given
him experience which few men had. Ob
viously hitting at Vice-President Steven
son of his own State he said this conven
tion could not afford to nominate a candi
date whose breathless silence on the sub
ject of silver would cast suspicion on their
case. Take Bland and there would not be
asked bow long he had been a Democrat
and what were his views on silver. Nomi
nate Bland and no Republican words of
his against Democracy would rise up in
this campaign to chill enthusiasm. It had
been said they must nominate â¢ man who
could get Republican votes. He said first
of all nominate a man who could get Dem
ocratic votes. [Cheers.] Nominate Bland
and $400,00 C,OOO issued under the Bland
act would rise up before the people and
appeal for his election. [Cheers.]
Under the call of States when the name
of Caliiornia was reached Chairman Foote
announced that Senator White of tbat
State had refused to allow bis name to be
presented to the convention.
When the State of Georgia was called
H. T. Lewis of that State came to the
platform and put in nomination William
J. Bryan of Nebraska, saying that if pub
lic office was a reward for public service
no man merited such reward more than
he. In the late political contests Mr.
Bryan stood among his peers like Saul
among the Israelites, head and shoulders
above all the rest.
"Honor him with the nomination," he
said, "and you will do credit to the party
and earn for yourselves the plaudits of
your constituents and the thanks ofpoa
terity."
A scene which was almost a duplication
of that which attended the nomination of
Mr. Bland was enacted when Mr. Bryan's
name was proposed to the convention.
The delegates from Georgia, Louisiana,
Nebraska, Michigan, South Dakota and
Mississippi rallied about the spear-shaped
guidons which bear the names of their
States and indicate their position on the
floor.
All the silver delegates arose and joined
in vociferous shouting and waving of hats,
handkerchiefs, newspapers and every
wavable object upon which they could
lay their hands. The scene was uproari
ous for about fourteen minutes.
Theodore F. Klutz of North Carolina
seconded the nomination of Mr. Bryan.
He spoke of him as the young giant of
the West; that friend of the people; that
champion of the oppressed ; that apostle
and prophet of this great crusade for finan
cial reform. He can poll, he added, every
Democratic vote in every section of this
great country that any other man can, and
more than that, he can poll more votes
from pereons of different political persua
sions and do more to unite the friends of
free silver than all ol them put together.
[Cheers.]
Mr. Bryan's nomination was also sec
onded by G. Fred Williams of Massachu
setts, who spoke of crowning a leader in
the great agricultural movement that was
giving hope to the country and life to the
Democracy.
"We want," he said, "a young man to
wield the sword of an indignant people.
We want in this desperate contest a young
giant out of the loins of a giant republic.
We want no Napoleon [cheers] who
marched to a throne under the mantle of
liberty. What I present to yon is a new
Cicero to meet the new Catalines of to
day." [Applause.] His speech in full fol
lows:
The State of Georgia has requested me to add
voice to its wish in this convention. As we
are about to crown a leader of the great agri
cultural movement which has given new life
and hope to the : Democracy, let me offer as a
new sign and token ' the . golden ; sheaf iof Ne
braska's waving i grain. .. .We want the strength
of . you th for the hardship of > a new cause, a
heart which can bum with the fire of pur
pose, a young man to wield the mighty sword
of : an indignant people ; <.. new sympathy ' for
new woes; unfailing vigor in a desperate con
test; a young giant out of the loins of a giant
republic. -, We want no Napoleon to rise ;to ; a
despotic ; throne â¢> under the mantle of liberty,
but a new Cicero against the Catalines of : to
day. Without his knowledge, against his wish,
I present the name of William J.Bryan of Ne
braska, r
' 1 Thomas - J. . Kernan <of ' Louisiana also
made a seconding speech in' favor of Mr.
Bryan.
"We have this day," he said, "unlike
our Republican brethren, declared that we
will no longer worship the golden calf
which England ha 3 set up. We have re
fused to permit this idol to command us in
the words of the Deity, 'I am thy Lord, thy
God; thou shalt have no other gods before
me.' \Ve have â  declared that hence
forth both gold and silver shall rule equal
sovereigns in the world of finance. This
is not a resolution. It is a restoration. It
determines not tbat gold shall be despoiled
of any of her just" powers, but only that
silver shall 'have herown again." [Cheers.]
Signs of impatience at the length of Mr.
Kernau's address interrupted him, to
which be replied: "I note with pleasure
that I am receiving the respectful atten
tion of those on this floor and lor the jeers
of the gallery I care no more than for the
jeers of the Republicans."
Mr. Kernan was so long before he
named whom he was supporting that loud
cries of "'Who is it?" were raised and a
great uproar prevailed. He finally named
Mr. Bryan and sat down.
Senator David Tnrpie of Indiana rose to
nominate Governor Matthews of that
State, but was so indistinctly heard that
cries ol "louder" were raised, and the
chairman explained that the Senator's
voice was weak and asted indulgence. He
spoke Its follows:
Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: Tiie choice of a candidate for the Presi
dency by the National Democratic Convention,
of one who is to be the Chief Magistrate of this
country for the next official term, of a suc
cessor to the many illustrious statesmen of our
political faith who have served in that exalted
position, Â»o easily becomes the subject of
glowing zeal and fancy, that the act and duty
of selection are prone to be obscured by the
glamor of the theme. Yet we ought to realize
that the result is a plain question of arith
metic, depending upon a simple count of
numbers, and that for many other reasons our
action herein should be determined only by
the most rigid scrutiny, and by the most care
ful calculation.
We ask. then, as practical men where should
this nomination be placed? Indiana has long
been known as the arena of the most severe
and closely fought political contests. It is a
member of the great Democratic phalanx of
the North, including New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut, but strangely isolated it has
stood alone. Upon the east and west and
upon the north we have ordinarily hostile
borders of intense spirit and activity, and
even upon the south the migration to us across
the waters of the Ohio, which occurs regularly
In the Presidential year, is usually of such
complexion as only to give aid and comfort to
the enemy. In a State so nearly balanced that
for years there has not been, in a Presidential
election, a mfijority either way of 10,000 in a
total vote oi 400,000 or 500,000, the condi
tions require that our Democracy stand always
embattled, whether awaiting victory or de
feat, always prepared.
We submit to the delegations from the great
States of Tennessee, of Georgia, of Mississippi
and others more centrally situated as to their
political life and progress what would you
give, what would you not give, to make this
State as certain as yÂ«ur own? How and when
shall you help us to send yon the message in
November next of victory? This is the place,
the time isnow to write that message. You can
write that 'message to-day ready for transmis
sion if your favor shall make the man of our
choice the nominee of this convention. Sur
vey the field, examine Its various positions,
throw the searchlight of inspection upon the
status of the different candidates, you will find
that Indiana is the strategic point and pivot
I of this conflict. The prestige, the power, the
honor of this nomination are great, but not
too great to be used as a means of assured suc
cess.
Let us not be misled by the fervid predica
tions of overconndence, by the contagious and
stirring enthusiasm of the passing hour. Re
member, gentlemen, that the returns of the
election are not yet received, they will not be
gin to arrive until many months hence. We
must overcome ah enemy strong fortressed
against attack, re-enforced by influence,to-day
unmanned, unknown, flashed with the shout
of recent triumph. We may make an error
which shall cost us the whole stake, an error
Irretrievable. The opportunity for success is
here, but also that of defeat. Let every man
so act that he may not have to Â«ay hereafter,
"Ah, I had not thought of that," as has been
done more than once before. We may court
defeat and disaster, as a lover wooes his bride,
by failing to put the right man in the right
place. Let us then consult reason. Let us
calmly weigh probabilities and compute the
chances at such a ratio as shall include and
i cover all contingencies. Let us dispose of the
aid of their prestige of nomination where it
will be most highly appreciated, where it will
be most effective, where it is most needed and
where it must win.
Our candidate had the good fortune to be
born in one of the old Kentucky homes, as
near to mansions in the skies as any habita
tions on this planet. He was educated and
graduated at Center College, Danville, in its
palmiest days of yore, from the doors of which
came McCreary, Vest, Blackburn, Stevenson
and others.-men of National distinction and
renown. He belongs by birth and lineage to
the South. The South has no worthier or more
noble son. He married early in life the daugh
ter of one well known in the history of our
State, Governor and Senator Whitcoiab. He
commenced life as a farmer in one of the most
fertile sections of the valley of the Wabash.
Prosperity, well pleased and justly earned, has
waited upon his footsteps. Protection he
needed not, save that of his pure heart and
stalwart arm. He is now and always has been
a farmer. He has walked for years in the fur
row ; ho has stepped off the "lands" ; he is not
only a hearer but a doei of the word.
He that by the plow would thrive
Himself mast either hold or drive.
Our candidate belongs to the largest, the
most ancient and honorable business associa
tion of the world. Much is now said about the
business and the business interests of this
country. The business of a country is that
vocation in which the larger number of Us
inhabitants are engaged. Agriculture in the
United States employs a greater number of
workmen than any other calling:â hardly less
thin that of all others combined. We ask the
delegates of this convention deliberately to
consider whether it may not be well worth the
while to make a choice ol one who is in the
Closest natural alliance with this most nu
merous and influential body of our fellow
citizensâone who has been all his life a mem
ber of this grand confraternity of the field and
farm.
Ii is fifty-five years since a farmer appeared
at the east front of the Capitol to take tne oath
as President upon inauguration day. The in
auguration and service of Indiana's choice
would be a reminder of the earlierâ the ideal
days of this Republic, when, as tradition re
lates, Jefferson left his farm at Monticello,
traveled on horseback to the seat of govern
ment without ceremony, took the constitu
tional obligation and was inducted into office.
Our candidate is and has been from his
youth up to this hour, aiter the strai test sect
of our political school, a Democratâ an intel
ligent, able, earnest and most dilipent worker
in the cause. His flm public service was that
of a member of the General Assembly, to
which he had been chosen by his friends and
neighbors in and near the county of his resi
dence. In 1890 he was elected Secretary of
State of the State of Indiana. After a very
exciting and laborious canvass, in 1892 he was
chosen Governor of Indiana, the office he now
holds, and in which he has shown those rare
qualities of wise administration, executive
skill and genius and unwearied and conscien
tious discharge of duty in such manner as to
have challenged alike the admiration and ap- I
proval of men of ail parties in our common- j
wealth.
In this friena of ours, for whom not for his j
saKe but for our own we solicit your favor and j
support, you will find the best attainments of |
the scholar and statesman fitly joined to- !
greiher and a most intimate acquaintance with j
the wants and interests of the many upon
whose suffrages the success of these must de- I
pend. The person whose name we shall pre- j
sent here has never been beaten in a popular
election in his own State. Our State, the State
which by every sort of accent and emphasis is
pushed at this juncture to the front, where the
men in the gap of this great controversy
abideâ this State which danger haunts, which
doubt has known and marked; this State we
oiler while we ask the man. He whose name
we shall announce for your consideration
comes not as a guest or a sojourner to this
great National council. He comes as a mem
ber aud inmate of the family to his house and
home, wherein he has gained the right of
domicile by lifelong fealty to the cause of
American Democracy.
Upon the issue of the tariff, of Federal elec
tion laws, of the liberty of the citizen, of the
disposition of the public domain to actual set
tlors only, in opposition to all subsidies to pri
vate corporations, in favor of the rights and
privileges of organized labor, and of still lur
ther legislation toward that beneficent end,
our candidate has stood with us and for us
through many years of heated quarrel and de
bate, and upon that question now so conspicu
ous his opinions have long been known and
have often, both in his own State and else
where, be^n the subject of the most public and
most explicit declaration.
Our candidate believes in the immediate
restoration oi silver to the full franchise of the
mint; that the stamierd silver dollars should
be coined without restriction at the same ratio
of 16 to 1 as was formerly by law established,
and when so coined that it shall be a legal ten
der for all debt.
ne is not in favor of awaiting the action of
European nations upon this subject, and per
ceives no reason for deferring or postponing
the remonetization of silver to suit the con
venience, assent or agreement of other Gov
ernments. Ardently sympathizing with the
Republic of Cuba, he is strongly attached to
the doctrine of Monroe. An American in every
fiber, he would resist foreign aggression in
any form. He heartily denounces as un-
American the Republican platform adopted
not lon* since at St. Louis which would
maintain, and continue in this country, tnat
alien rule of foreign policy, the English single
standard of gold, and which purposes at this
time to reduce the Government and the people
of the United States, financially, to their
ancient condition as a colonial possession to
the British crown. He thinks the freedom and
independence of the mint and coinage of the
United States are as necessary to our National
prosperity as any other of our libertiesâ these
rights once ours now lost, from whatever
causes, must and shall be regained.
Thus the State, the man and the cause
merged at last into one, appeal to your wis
dom, to your serious judgment, to your most
discreet discernment.
And i now, therefore, in pursuance of the
instructions of the united Democracy of our
State expressed in convention, and of the
unanimous action of the delegates here pres
ent, do in all confidence place in nomination
as a candidate for the Presidency the name of
Claude Matthews of Indiana.
While the Senator was making his re
marks there was a constant passage of
people to and fro along the aisles, whistles,
catcalls from the galleries and great con
fusion. A voice in the north gallery
shouted, "I nominate Cleveland," and
cheers for Cleveland were called for and
given. The Senator resumed undismayed
tnough his voice was inaudible ten feet
away from where he stood.
Finally, however, the disorder became
so great that Mr. Turpie appealed to the
chair and sufficient silence was secured to
enable him to nominate Matthews, and
there was a slight demonstration of ap
plause, which was confined to the Indiana
delegation.
Hon. Oscar Trippett of California was
next presented to second the nomination
of Governor Matthews. He said:
Gentlemen of the Convention: California
is the greatest producing State in the
Union, but notwithstanding this and the ad
vantage she would gain by reason of a singla
gold standard she is not jealous of her silver
producing sister States, and joins with the de
mand of the people for a free and unlimited
coinnge of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. In
recognition of the wishes of her people the
Republican party of that State sent to the st.
Louis convention a delegation instructed in
favor of the free and unlimited coinage of
silver. That delegation returned to their
homes in defeat and disgrace, wearing the
gold badges dictated by Wall street and the
money sharks of Europe.
The Democracy of California recently as
sembled in the largest and most enthusiastic
convention ever held within the State, and
that convention also unanimously instructed
its delegaies to this convention to vote as a
unit for the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver at the ratio of 16 to 1. The delegates to
this convention will return to their homes

flushed with victory to receive the plaudits oi
the people.
At St. Louis was heard the voice of Wall
street, at which England rejoices. To-day la
heard the voice of the people of America and
John Bull will groan. How often have we
heard from the Republican platform the de
nunciation of the Democratic party for a fan
cied alliance with England, and now this
same party, with a singular inconsistency, has
joined heart and soul with England against
the Democrats of a suffering people.
This convention having adopted a platform
which declares in favor of the honest money
of our forefathers, the delegation of theEmpiro
State of the Pacific Coast desires the nomina
tion by this convention of a man in harmony
with the principles announced. This great
State extends her hand toward the Atlantis
seaboard and asks to be met half way, and
that a Western man be selected ac thonomineo
of this convention. Without wishing to say
aught in disparagement of other gentlemen
whose names have been presented to this con
vention, I take great pleasure in seconding tile
nomination of Governor Matthews of Indiana.
This is a convention of the people, and what
is more proper for this convention to do than
to select as its standard-bearer a man who
springs from that great class of American
peopleâ the farmers of the United States? Like
a Cincinnatus, he was called from the plow to
preside over the destinies of the great State ot
Indiana, and so fully has he met every expec
tation that be has sprung into National promi
nence and respect more rapidly than any man
of his generation. I think with the delegates
coming here from the Pacific Slope that if this*
convention will nominate this distinguished
citizen of the great Middle West he will lead"
to victory the Democratic cohorts in Novem
ber.
Z After 10:30, soon after Mr. Trippett
took the platform, the uproar was so greafe
that a delegate from Indiana suggested an
adjournment.
An attempt was made to restore order
and the sergeant-at-arms, who is quite a
character in his way and who delights mi
making speeches from the stand, addressed
the audience, saying:
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want yonr
attention for a few moments. I want to
say that the chairman of this convention'
desires that I shall announce to
you tnat unless there is perfect*,
order [jeers] the convention to- mor*
row will be held without any guests.
The delegations will be protected by the
police and the audience will not be perÂ«
nutted to come into the hall. Now keep
order." [Shouts of laughter.] v
The chairman added to the speech of
the sergeant-at-arms that no one would
be admitted to the hall to-morrow except
delegates and alternates. [Derisive
shouts of "good."] "Order," the chair
man commanded, and he lectured the
spectators, reminding them that they
were the guests of the convention and
should keep quiet so that the business of
the convention might be transacted
quietly.
Mr. Martin of Kansas indulged in some
playful ridicule of the vain efforts of the
chairman and sergeant-at-arms to main
tain order, and staid that if the same dis
respect which was shown to Senator Tnr
pie was repeated toward other speakers be
would move to adjourn the convention
until to-morrow when it would be seen
whether officers could protect the con
vention.
Hon. Fred White of lowa was recognized
to nominate ex-Governor Boies. Cheers
of a comparatively mild type greeted the
announcement and the Boies banner was
raised, air. White has a sonorous voice
and a good delivery and was listened to
with attention. He said :
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: I am authorized by the Democracy of
lowa to present to this convention for the
romination for the high office of President the
name of Horace Boies of our State. I want to
assure this convention in advance that this is
not the result of any question of mere local
pride, nor is it the result of any consideration
of the question of mere availability. We ask
you to nominate the candidate of our choice
upon far broader groundsâ upon the broad
ground that Horace Boies is emphatically a
broad man. Those of us who know him best
do not hesitate either here or elsewhere to de
clare with all the confidence that a thorough
knowledge of the truth can inspire that he is a
man of the stanchest character, possessing a
powerful personality and equipped with a
combination of mental qualities that will
make him, if elected, an ideal executive.
Knowing as we all do that the political
situation of the country is a grave and omin
ous one, this convention must not ignore or
evade the responsibility this situation creates,
which is to give to the American people a can
didate the mention of whose name, wherever
known, will carry with it an overwhelming
strength and stand in case of election as an
unqualified guarantee for the entire safety In
the management of all public affairs, the just
settlement of every pressing question and the
speedy inauguration of a vigorous reign of ex
act justice.
Neither in formulating a policy nor in tha
34
execution of the same, nor yet in presenting
an argument upon 1 the merits or demerits of
any public question, has Governor Boies ever
striven in the least degree to create a sensa
tion. To his everlasting honor, it must be said
tnat in the doing of these things ho has never
fayed to make a deep impression. This is the
ideal test by which the capacity of a public
man should be judged; * this- is the high
standard by which a statesman's reliability and
usefulness should be ascertained and deter
mined! If you select Governor Boies as your
candidate and the people ratify your decision
in November, we can promise you no pyro
technic display from the White House during
his administration; there will bo no rockets
Bent up, the explosion of which will frijrhten
the timorous or furnish a subject for foolish
talk for the superficial; there will be no sensa
tional performances upon the political trapez-3
at the executive mansion while Horace
Boies is it* occupant; he will write you
no startling message upon excitable nubile
topics; we promise you none of these perform
ances; but I tell you what we can and do
promise yon, and that is the inauguration and
faithful execution of a policy that will com
mend itself to every philosophic mind and be
applauded by every sincere patriot; a policy
that will be characterized throughout by the
invigorating force of hard common-sense and
be all aglow with the everlasting sunshine of
noble intentions; a policy the primary object
of which will be, not the creation of oppor
tunities for the unnatural increase of the al
ready excessive fortunes of an avaricious class,
but the strict maintenance of the natural and
constitutional rights of every citizen care
fully, including that great body of our popula
tion, the laboring classesâ the people who
produce our National wealth, who never tire
of their devotion to the constitution, who
never desert their country's cause at any stage
of any peril, who are always true and steadfast
even in the very midst of an overwhelming
crisis, who furnish the volunteer soldier and
sailor in time of war and earn the wherewith
to pay the cost of war when it is over; the peo
ple who are the very mainstay of free govern
mentâto secure to these a larger share of the
fruits of their labor, to secure to them im
partial justice, will be one of the cardinal
principles fully developed in the policy of the
Boies administration.
To secure to him who earns a dollar the dol
lar he earns is a task that will be vigorously
exacted of the statesmanship of the future.
That type of statesmanship which so persist
ently ana successfully plotted to pilfer from
the industrious that the idle may thrive will
be given its death-blow next November if you
men here are wise in your councils and provide
the opportunity for the people to strike the
blow.
Horace Boles was born in New' York State
and came to lowa in his early manhood. He
came not as an adventurer, but with the fixed
purpose of building up a permanent home,
which he did at the town of Waterloo. While
he thus voluntarily and resolutely incurred
all the inconveniences of a practically frontier
life, the result is that in his maturer years the
people of his State have loaded him down with
the richest honors and rewards It is in their
power to bestow, and he is to-day an insep
arable and the most conspicuous part of the
phenomenal history of our State. Let me beg
of this convention the privilege to give you just
one glimpse of lowa history. As to the ques
tion of lowa being a great State, concerning
the capacity of her soil to produce uniformly
abundant crops, I will not deal. It is enough
to say that the diploma awarded to lowa by
the management of the Columbian Exposition
is the official declaration which secures to us
what had been before conceded by all, viz. :
the crowning glory of a standing at the head
of the long column of the agricultural States
of this Nation. Neither drouth nor flood have
ever been powerful enough in lowa to consti
tute what in other localities is a natural calam
ity. I have raised fifty bushels of solid corn
per acre, upon wnicb not one drop of rain fell
from the time it came up until the ear was
fully grown. There is perhaps not another
spot in this wide world where such a
thing is possible. But while we are
easily supreme In the cornfield, lowa
Democrats have had a hard row to hoe |
in politics. The torments inflicted by the j
seven plagues of Egypt must have been a solid ;
chunk of comtort compared to the treatment
accorded lowa Democrats by the sixty, seventy
and eighty thousand uninterrupted Republi
can majority which for more than a genera
tion delighted in making an annual -picnic out
of election day. and'- just for the fun of the
miner trampled the lowa Democracy bodily
into the earth. This huge army of Republican
voters was dominated by the spirit of an inex
plicable fanaticism, and the more we combat
ed this spirit the fiercer it grew. Naturally ;
Democrats became disheartened and scarce. â¢
When this Republican recklessness was near
ing the culminating point, when through i
sumptuary legislation every fundamental j
guarantee of personal liberty was endangered, i
when acts which throughout the civilized j
world are regarded as natural and treated as
lawful were in our State defined as crimes and '
compared to capital offenses, when the consti- j
tutional protection of trial by jury, which for j
centuries has been esteemed as the very cli
max of all the glory of our Anglo-Saxon civ- ;
ilization.when this was about to be eliminated
from our judicial system and the method of
cold, barbarous Russia was to be substituted,
In fact, when the whole machinery of local
self-government, the greatest of all the Demo
cratic principles, the principle of home rule,
â was about to be swept out of existence; when
every lover of freedom was on the point of de
spairing, when theie was no Democratic
leader anywhere . in- â  sight wise and
bold enough to face the crisis, there
was heard the voice of one as speaking in the
wilderness; it was the magic voice of Horace
Boies summoning disneartened men to heroic
fiction. He it was who leaped boldly to the
very front and alone defied the seemingly irre
sistible power of an exultant foe, a foe that
had never been chastened by defeat. He ac
complished what all men united in declaring
the impossible, for in the two contests which
followed, which in many respects have no
parallel- in the history of American politics,
Horace Boies came off victor, and thus did he
forever avert the danger of having a veritable
despotism planted upon the fruitful soil of a
free State. A soldier can show his courage
only in battle; a sailor his fearlessness only
while a storm is raging: the firemen in your
great city can only exhibit that sublime type
Of heroism which we all so much admire dur
ing the time of an actual conflagration, when
property is to be saved and imperiled lives are
to be rescued; so a statesman can only show
his real capacity, can only demonstrate the
full measure of his wisdom and power during
a crisis. It is only during an actual crisis that
the higher qualities of statesmanship can be
developed and tested. That Horace Boies pos
sesses this rarest of all human capacitiesâ
power to rise equal and superior to a crisisand
control itâ is attested by this history of 'our
State and concurrent testimony of i political
friend and foe. This is the man who stands
before the American people, equipped with
these supreme qualifications, that wo ask this
convention to nominate.
. Upon the overshadowing issue of this cam
paign Governor Boies stands upon, an invul
nerable platformâ the constitution of his coun
tryâinasmuch as the constitution, in defining
what the States shall use as "legal tender in
payment of debts," designates not gold or
silver, but gold and silver. Governor , Boles
believes that the bimetallic system thus pro
videdfor in the fundamental law of the land
is the system the Democratic party must in
dorse and uphold. He believes that so long as
the constitution remains unchanged Con
gress has no power to demonetize either metal.
Hence, in common with the great mass of the
American people, he believes the demonetiza
tion : oi â  silver was not an ordinary political
blurder but an actual crime, and he. can con- i
ceive of no condition which can possibly arise
that will justify the Democratic party in justi
fying that crime or in helping to perpetuate
its direful results.
Governor Boies does not believe in a dis
honest 50-cent dollar, as it would work an in
jury to the creditor class, neither does he be
lieve In a 200-cent dollar, which is still more
dishonest, as it unquestionably involves tno
Dankrupt debtor class. Governor Boies be-
Hoves in an honest American \ dollar author
ised not by th British Parliament but by a
law of the American Congress arid coined for
Use among the American people." He believes
in a gold dollar of 22.2 grain of gold and a.
kilver dollar just sixteen times heavier.
T Having rebelled against British insolence
over a century ago, winning the fight when a,
mere weakling, haying now developed' into .'
the strongest people on earth, clearly entitling'
a Â« to the \ep.dership among the nations, Gov
ernor Boles believes It would be not merely a
pitiable cowardice on our part, but actual
treason to the people, should be now capitulate
to English greed.
The finÃer of a kind fete points to the elec
tion of Horace Boies. History geoms to be
anxious to repeat itself. Give us the man from
Waterloo and allies will flock to his standard
which will destroy Mark Hanna's Napoleon
| No. 2 as effectually as the European allies de
stroyed tne French Napoleon No. 1.
A Boies demonstration was started by
the lowa delegation, but no progress was
made until two young women' dressed in
white in the south gallery stood up and,
j wildly waving their arms, begun shrieking
| for lowa's Governor. Somebody handed
i one of them a couple of flairs, and by this
j time the attention of the whole convention
was directed toward them and everybody
faced that way.
The Boies banner was banded to them
and between them they managed to wave
it a few times and then sank back in their
j seats exhausted. After a brief rest one of
them rose aeain and was escorted to the
floor, everybody standing on chairs to see
the sight and cheering and laughing as
| the enthusiastic lady, escorted by some
male friend with his arm around her
waist, danced all around the hall. The
name of the author of this extraordinary
demonstration was stated to be Miss Min
nie Murray of Nashua, lowa. She in
formed a reporter of the United Press that
she was only 22 years old. It was fifteen
minutes after 11 o'clock when this scene
collapsed and the fair lowan and her
escort settled down in seats tendered them
among the lowa delegation.
The extraordinary episode occupied
nearly half an hour.
As soon as some slight degree of order
was re-established the nomination of Mr.
Boies was seconded by Mr. A. T. Smith of
Minnesota, who characterized the candi
date as "the grand old commoner of the
Hawkeye State." If it had not been for
Horace Boies, said Mr. Smith, there would
be no silver majority in the convention to
day. Michigan had just been carried for
the gold standard, when, all at once,
Horace Boies threw down the gag* of
battle to the federal officeholders, and the
result was that the prairies were on fire
and that thirty-six delegates were elected
to the convention to vote for free silver
and Horace Boies. That was the crucial
point of the battle. The cause of silver
was then won.
Hon. John S. Rea, with a voice almost
as resonant and very closely resembling
that of the Senator he nominated, placed
in nomination the name of Senator Joseph
C. S. Blackburn of Kentucky. He pre
faced his remarks with the pledge t at
whoever was nominated Kentucky would
give him her vote. He spoke of his can
didate as "Joe" Blackburn, because to
Kentuckians he was "Joe" Blackburn,
and thac meant everything. fCheers.] It
was true that he was from the South and
had been a Confederate soldier, but his
candidacy was not a sectional one.
[Cheers.]
The candidacy of Blackburn appealed
to the whole Union of States, and if nomi
nated and elected he would be no sectional
President. His whole public career, cov
ering a third of a century, had been a life
long expression of his sympathy with labor.
He had shown himself the peer of the
ablest men in Congress. His voice had
been heard in forty-five States in advocacy
of Democratic principles. He was modest,
yet not wanting in that finer ambition
which made men pure; his honor impreg
nable and his simplicity sublime. He
aaded that i; it were the will of this con
vention that Mr. Blackburn should remain
in his present field of service his voice
would be raised in behalf of any other can
didate that may be named.
W. W. Foote of California, in seconding
the nomination of Mr. Blackburn, added
to the recent incident by' saying that his
candidate was not being "paraded round
here by any Joan of Ark." This was
greeted with laughter. He briefly but
forcibly eulogized Mr. Blackburn's char
acter and services, and his remarks were
well received.
When Massachusetts was called the
chairman of the delegation said Massa
chusetts had intended to present the
name of Governor Russell, but Mr. Rus
sell declined to run on the platform
adoptfd.
Paul Jones of Arkansas also seconded
the nomination of Mr. Bland, who, he
said, was no new convert to or experiment
in Democracy. He had fought the battles
of the party for twenty-two years, under
the terrible blaze of a political search
light, and no spot had been found upon
his escutcheon; no flaw in his armor. He
was the logical candidate on the great
issue that now confronts the American
people and which issue would be settled
in November.
The call of States being resumed, New
Jersey declared through her chairman,
Allen McDermott, that she desired to
name no candidate on the platform of the
convention. New York, through Senator
Hill, said she had no candidate, and cries
of "Hill !" were raised.
Mr. Patrick of Ohio, when (be name of
his State was called, put in nomination
John R. McLean of Cincinnati and said:
"I shall pass no extravagant eulogy on
the man. His whole life epeaks for itself.
He is honest; he is capable; he is a Demo
crat. He is the son of a sire who did more
to mold the Democracy of Ohio into
triumph than any man in the State. I
have heard eulogies on the favorite sons
named here to-night. Some of them
might carry Ohio against. William Mc-
Kinley. but, by the eternal God, John R.
McLean will carry Ohio against William
McKiuley. (Cheers.) If you nominate
John R. McLean I promise you that Ohio
will be the Waterloo ol McKinley. From
the very beginning of this great war
of the millionaires against the millions;
of the classes against the masses, John R.
McLean's thought and soul has been with
the people. He was the bravest soldier,
the noblest pioneer, in the cause of free
silver when that cause had few friends.
His preat journal, filled with arguments
in favor of the people, was scattered every
day in the year, falling as silently as snow
flakes into the laps of the people of twenty
States, and that great organ did more to
educate the people and to develop the
growth of bimetallism and free silver than
any one influence west of the Allegheny
Mountains. Delegates, we hand over the
claim of John R. McLean into your hands
and into your hearts, relying on the in
tegrity and gratitude of the great Demo
cratic masses." [Cheers.]
Chairman Harrity of Pennsylvania.when
his State was called, said Pennsylvania
had no candidate at this time, but when
the roll of States was called for the pur
pose of ascertaining their preferences for
candidates Pennsylvania would express
her wishes on the subject.
John H. Bankead of Alabama, one of
the delegates who had relieved Congress
! man Richardson as temporary chairman,
I introduced the next speaker, Hon. Joseph
:W. Bailey of Texas. Mr. Bailey was
warmly applauded on taking the stand.
He said :
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: For the first time iince the close of our un
happy Civil War a large majority of those who
vote in the coming Presidential oonten will
be governed in the casting of their ballots by
their convictions upon a great economic ques
tion. This convention has a (ready adopted a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
platform which announces with admirable
force and clearness the position of the Demo
cratic party upon that question, and it is our
duty now to complete ourwork by nominating
a man whose words and deeds are better tban
a written pledge that he will faithfully per
form the promise which our platform makes.
Who shall this man be ?
If I should ask this audience or if I should
ask any audience assembled on the American
continent and under the American flag what
Democrat among the many splendid leaders of
our party best represents the issue which we
have made and which must be decided at the
polls on the 3d of next November you and
every other audience wouid answer with the
name of Richard Bland, and, gentlemen of the
convention, he not only typifies the paramount
issue In the coming election, but he has been a
fearless and consistent advocate of all of those
immortal principles of Democracy which our
fathers cherished and defended. Those who
doubt the wisdom of his nomination some
times venture to express the fear that he is
not great enough to be our President. To
them I say: Inspect his record. For twenty
two years he sit in the Federal House of Rep
resentatives, aud during, that time he voted
right as often and he voted wrong as seldom as
any man who ever occupied a similar station
for an equal length ol time.
No ordinary man can safely pass this ex
treme and crucial test, and the intelligent
voters of this land are willing to believe any
man who is wise euough always to be right is
wise enough to be the Chief Magistrate of this
Republic.
And still better than his unerring common
sense is his unyielding honesty. In his person
he unites the highest qualities of an ideal can
didate. He is so patriotic that he has always
put the love of country above the love of self,
and second only to the fear of Qod. He is so
honest that no tainted dollar ever touched his
hands; he is so brave that a legion of his coun
try's enemies could not drive him to betray a
trust, and his nomination will proclaim to the
millions who are proud to own their allegiance
to Democracy that the public good is again to
be exalted above private greed.
The nomination of Mr. Bland would reassure
the doubters, recall the Democratic wanderers
and inspire the masses with hopeful couratce.
Nominate him, and in every home, whether
palace or cabin, it will be told how a great and
luccessiul party has crowned with highest
honor a private citizen because he has teen
true to bin own conscience aud loyal to the
best interests of his countrymen. But gentle
men of the convention, whether your choice
will be Bland or Boies, Matthews or McLean,
or Kentucky's gifted son, the imperial com
monwealth of Texas, with her mure than
100,000 majority, will take her place M the
head ot the victorious Democratic column.
Hon. Joseph Rawlins of Utah briefly
seconded the nomination of Bland.
Virginia being called in the roll of
States, the chairman stated that they had
been instructed to present the name of
Hon. John W. Daniel, but at his earnest
request and insistence did not do so.
The nomination of Mr. Blackburn was
also seconded by J. W. St. Clair, who said
that though they loved Bland and revered
Boies and honored McLean and Matthews,
Blackburn was grander than them all.
[Cheers.] Blackburn had carried Ken
tucky, Cleveland and Carlisle to the con
trary notwithstanding. Blackburn had
been a Confederate soldier, but the people
of the South had paid tneir share of Fed
eral taxes and helped to pay the pensions
of Union soldiers.
"Let that issue, therefore," he said, "be
buried, and give us a Southern candidate
once more."
When the State of Wisconsin was called,
General Braeg, the picturesque old hero,
chairman of the delegation, rising on a
chair in his place, -aid: "Wisconsin can
not participate iv the nomination of any
man calling himself a Democrat upon a
Populist platform." [Cheers mingled with
hisses.]
One of the delegates from the State fol
lowed, saying that on rtie part of some of
the delegates from Wisconsin he desired
to second tne nomination of Joseph Black
burn of Kentucky.
E. J. Dockery of Wisconsin then took
his place on the platform aad said:
"My vote is stifled in this convention by
an nn-Deraocratic unit rule, and I am,
therefore, prevented from having it re
corded in favor of that idol of the conven
tion, William J. Bryan of Nebraska, who
ought to be nominated; but I desire to
say, gentlemen of the convention,
that the people of the State
will give its electoral vote to the nominee
of this convention, whoever he may be, at
the election in November. [Cheers.] That
candidate will not receive the votes of the
men who are in this convention claiming
to represent the Democracy of Wisconsin,
but the people will register their will at
the ballot-box."
Amid much confusion General Bragg
again arose and claimed the attention of
the convention to say: "With your kind
permission we will send out and make
search for another straggler, and if we are
successful, Wisconsin may yet pledge its
support to another candidate." [Laughter
and hisses.]
At the close of the call of the roll of
States, the convention at 12:35 a. m., ad
journed until 10 a. M., when balloting will
be begun.
WEAKENED BY DELAY.
Had the Balloting Begun Last Night
Bryan Would Have Been
Nominated.
CHICAGO, 111., July 9.â After the
speech of William J. Bryan, which termi
nated in an ovation to the young orator, it
was conceded that had it been at a time in
the proceedings when he could have been
nominated he would have received the
Presidential billet by acclamation, but
after the adjournment the general ardor
cooled a little.
It had been arranged that George Fred
Williams, the lone gold delegate of Maa
sachusetts, was to nominate Bryan.
Bryan's speech had been bulletined all over
the Bouth, and there came telegram after
telegram from different Southern States to
their delegations to go for Bryan.
Georgia, which had been hitherto unde
cided, was one of many unanimous lor
him.
When he was at the evening session
brought out as a decided candidate, how
ever, other friends of Bryan in tne West
felt that his chances were possibly weak
ened. He ought to have remained, they
thought, in the background, doing as Gar
field did, till at the last when it was
believed the convention would break for
him.
This was the opinion of many of the
California delegation who were friendly to
h m, and are yet, and wtio, if Senator
White is not brought in, will gladly vote
for Bryan.
Banator White did not preside to-day,
but calied a substitute to his place and re
mained in the background.
The eyes were White, Church, Leake,
Wise, Metzger, Fitzgerald and Dr. Egaul
The noes were Foote, Coleman, Dozier,
Lane, Caminetti and Burke. The five who
did not vote, being absent, were Maguire,
Dwyer, Trippett and Darmony.
It is given out quietly to-night that when
it comes to voting on the different nomi
nees. New York, Massachusetts, New Jer
sey, Connecticut, Deleware. Rhode Island
and Pennsylvania will refuse utterly to
vote.
This will make the total number of
voting States foot up but a little over 400
votes. As the convention is woiking
unde- the rules of the fifty-third Congress
requiring a two-thlrdi majority, only 306
votes will be necessary to choice, and who
ever gets this will be nominated Presi
dent, C . M. Cos.

court-martial for his execution. Willie is
wandering. He seems to have taken the
sentence of the court much more to heart
than was the intention or even the sus
picion of those who participated in the
mock trial or even of his closest friends,
or else he deliberately decided to steal a
march on the court-martial.
When last seen Private William Long
was makibg tracks down the hot and
dusty wagon road toward Sonoma at
about 5:40 o'clock. He was permitted the
freedom of the campground all day, and
in the afternoon went down to the swim
niinit hole in the creek.
Hugh Long, one of Willies brothers,
came up on the evening train, which gets
here about 7:30 o'clock, to help him.
Hush says he got the impression that
Willie was in jail up here for something
or other and he came up to see what he
could do to help him out. *
The court-martial called to try Private
Long for stabbing Cook Al Mattison
on the left eyebrow with a saber while
Mattison lay asleep in his tent on the
night of July 7, was called to order
at 9:30 o'tlock this morning in the
shade of a wide-spreading oak tree. It was
a burlesque, and the funniest thing that
has yet taken place in this camp of many
humorous incidents.
When Private Long was notified that
the court-martial was about to be held
and to appear, he wanted to know if be

should bring a rope to be hanged with.
Little Willie evidently suspected that he
would get the worst of it.
The officers detailed for the court-martial
assembled in full uniform, with sabers and
white gloves. Tney sat at a long table.
Overhead in the branches of the treÂ«3 the
cadets perched like squirrels in order to
get a better view of the proceedings, and
there was a crowd of spectators around
the table, including many visitors from
the neighboring springs. The day was a
pleasant one; in fact, the heat has given
waj to delightful coolness, and visitors to
the camp cannot complain of the weather
man.
Captain Frank S. Drady, president of the
court-martial, sat at one end of the table
and Rev. Father James A. McDonald,
judue advocate, at the other. The other
members were Captain Haggerty. Second

gate. Corporal Benjamin McKinley,
cousin of William McKinley, Presidential
nominee, assisted the judge advocate in
the prosecution, and Father Philip
O'Ryan appeared for the defense. Appear
was abont all he did, as anything that
looked like a defense for Long was not
allowed to come into evidence if the presi
dent and court-martial could help it. It
was a sure thing from the start that
"Little Willie" would be convicted and
sentenced to some horrible fate. He sat
near his counsel, and a bucket of water
was brought and placed before him so that
he might arink his fill and keep lrom
fainting as the trying ordeal proceeded.
Private Long was brought into the awful
presence of the court-martial by a guard
of six men with drawn sabers. He wore
his own saber, but the court did not mind
a prisoner coming into court armed any
more than to order him stripped of his
arms.
The formal charge against Private Long
was attempt to murder, with malice in his
heart. Lone, while on picket duty, stabbed
the cook while he lay asleep with tils head
outside his tent, thinking he was a fugitive
trying to escape from the lines.
The woundea Mattison was fixea up for
appearance as a witness. He was ban
daged, and was carried in on a stretcher
by the hospital corps.
When asked if he objected to any mem
ber of the court-martial, Long objected to
Lieutenant Drady.
"Why." he was asked.
"Well, just this morning he said he
would hang me," replied Lonp, earnestly.
Whereat there were shrieks of laughter.
After deliberation, and hearings state
ment from Drady that the remark was
made in jest and not in earnest, the lieu
tenant was retained on the court.
Cook Mattison, who had been groaning
horribly, was lilted from the stretcher
and laid carefully on the table in the
midst of the members of the court. Here
Private Long stated tbat McKinley had
offered to defend him the evening tefore
if he would buy him a dish of icecream.
Then Father O'Ryan, counsel for Long,
shrieked bribery, but the ears of the court
were deaf.
The commotion iv the presence of a man
who was stated to be on the verge of gasp
ing his last became so unseemly that an
orderly brought President Drady a tent
stake maul with a head on it as large as a
watermelon and a handle four feet long,
with which to pound on the table and
preserve order.
In feeble tones Cook Mattison told the
story of the alleged murderous assault on
him while he lay asleep. The doctor stood
by with one hand on the prostrate cook's
pulse while the assistant changed the
cloth on his forehead and placed a bottle
of tonic to Mb lips. At the conclusion of
the testimony the cook went into a->vio
lent tit. and it required six men to prevent
him from squirming off the table. The
cook muttered that he was in a trance.
Long objected to the cook's "acting."
The prisoner was ordered removed from
the court lor tnis, and Mattison was e-ooii
borne out of sight on the stretcher.
"Hold up!" exclaimed Father Ryan, "I
want to cross-examine that man."
"He's in a trance," said Dr. Mulligan.
Father O'Ryanâ Then 1 want this court
postpon d till be is able to be crose-ex
amined.
"Objection overruled," shouted the
president, bringing the big maul down on
the table with a terrible whack.
"This court is packed and gerryman
dered against this prisoner," vehemently
remonstrated the prisoner's coungel. "It
is a terrible thine to send a man into the
presence of bis Master. Think what you
are doing. This is a foul conspiracy."
For this Father O'Ryan was ordered
court-martialed himself, with the alterna
tive of buying icecream for the entire
camp.
At another time Father O'Ryan was
fined $5 for insisting on an objection which
the president and the maul had over
ruled*. Anything that the prisoner's coun
sel wanted to get before the court the presi
dent overruled.
Many witnesses were examined. Counsel
made th" closing statement, and it required
the court only as much time as it does to
write it to find "Little Willie" "guilty as
charged.' 1 The sentence was that he be
shot by the cannon at sunset. The
prisoner, with bowed head, was then led
slowiy away toward the guardhouse. Tne
judge advocate added that, in order to
majce suie be is shot, he should be tied
b hind the cannon. The cannon at Camp
MoniEomery is a small one, and experi-
ence shows it is likely to kick itself at one
discharge down to Sonoma.
But Willie Long was not executed to
night.

GUERNEVILLE, Cat,., July 9.-Nest
ling between the romantic hills of old
Sonoma County, Guerneville is an ideal
retreat for those who seek quiet and rest
and relief from the turmoil of city life.
Russian River ripples and splashes by, its
busy song an inspiration to relieve the
mind of thoughts of tropical weather; for
Old Sol occasionally displays his regard
for Guerneville by beaming upon the town
with unusual warmth.
Guernevilie has burned down several
timesâ wiped itself clean out of existence.
''Jest ketchea atire itself." said an old
lumberman; but each time the town resur
rected its If from the ashesâ phcenix-like,
as the City newspaper correspondents
afterward described the erection of new
houses.
But down among the tall redwoods, in
the deep canyon which the river ditched
for itself in some remote rainy era. then
is delicious comfort. The great wooden
nheafs catch the sun rays in their foliage
and hold it there, while the cool shadows
softly fall below. There is no prettier
spot on earth than the green bank of Rus
sian River underthe redwood trees. In one
of the grandest of these dark nooks of forest
| about four miles down the river from
Guerneville, is cam.t>e.i the Second Regi
ment of the Boys' Brigade, under com
mand of Colonel E. J. Walker, after whom
the camp is named. The other officers of
the reKiraent present are as follows: Major
A. W. Taylor, Major L. CobbledecK, Cap
tain B. L. Weymuth, Captain W. N. Jen
tins, Captain L. T. Ward, Captain H S.
Morton, Captain and Adjutant H T Hob
â  <=on. Captain W. Yv. McNeil!, Lieutenant
J. L. Hawlt-y, Lieutenant G. B. Din- more
Lieutenant Paul Ferguason, Dr. Henry m!
line and Dr. J. j. Medros, surgeons.
About 125 of the boys are on the ground,
; accompanied by thirty members of the
i W omen a Auxiliary The young soldiers
I are subjected to strict military discipline
! when on post, and the cam pis patroled by
j the boy guards day and ninht. It is
amusing to e>ee a sentry about three feet
high hold up a big lumberman with his
i small rifle and make the Visitor salute the
| regimenial colors as he goes by.
In the fine grove it is "like pitching the
| tents in an arbor, and ti.e effect of the
| great trees standing among white canvas
is indeed plÂ«aaing. Tne boys have the
j beautiful river a short distance away for a
i bathtub, anu squads can be seen swim
j mini' every hour of the day.
The regiment has hardly got down to
; camp life yet; the novelty of being in the
j woods overcomes their military stiffness
â â  and they are inclined to be more boys than
; soldiers. Last night Company C tried to
! run the guard line for a starlight swim in
j the river. They got lost in tlie darkness
l ana eventually landed in the guard tent.

City.
JOYOUS CALIFORNIANS.
Enthusiasm of the Delegates
Vented in Wild Demon
strations.
MODERATE RAILROAD BATES.
Fnnd of $25,000 Is Guaranteed by Citi
zens for the Entertainment of
Visitors.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July B.âNot
withstanding the collapse of the big white
tent "Williston" at 1 o'clock this morn
ing, due to the heavy fall of rain last
night and the severe windstorm that fol
lowed, the Christian Endeavorers quietly
engaged Central Hall and the work of the
convention proceeded without delay. The
other tents, "Washington" and "En
deavor," were packed long before the hour
of opening. Flags of every description,
streamers, banners and sashes, announc
ing the various State and district organ
izations, were displayed with nourish and
enthusiasm.
Promptly at the appointed hour the ex
ercises began in each tent with BonÂ«s and
prayer, the great chorus of a thousand
voices leading. Then came the hymn of
welcome, written for this occasion by
Colonel John Hay. Tbe addresses of wel
come by Chairman W. H. H. Smith, Rev.
S. H. Greene and Commissioner John W.
Ross of Washington followed and the re
sponses to these by Dr. R. J. Service of
Detrsit, Bishop Walters of New Jersey
and Professor W. W. Andrews of New
Brunswick. The addresses of President
Clark and Secretary Baer were then read
simultaneously in each tent.
Both of the tents, each holding 10,000,
were crowded to-night when the conven
tion met, and as many more people were
turned back, unable to gain admittance.
There were business meetings in Central
Hall, Calvary Baptist Church, First Con
gregational Church, Foundry Methodist
Episcopal Church, First Presbyterian
Church and New York-avenue Presbyter
ian Church.
As on the night before, when meetings
were held in twenty-two churches, the
luditoriums were well filled. The topic at
ill the meetings to-nisbt was Christian
citizenship, and many ot the speakers
nade pointed allusions to the complex
political situation before the country.
Ex-Postmaster-General Wanarnaker pre
sided at the meeting in Tent Washington.
He was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd
tnat reached far beyond the limits of the |
canvas above him. Rev. Howard H. Rus
sell of Columbus, Ohio, speaking on Chris
tian politics and the saloon, delivered the
opening address. Rev. Dr. Robert S. Mc-
Arthur of the Calvary Baptist Church fol
lowed.
William L. Wilson presided at Tent En
deavor and William F. Slocum of Colorado
spoke.
At the Metropolitan Methodist Episco
pal Church President Clark presided and
the address was delivered by Rev. B. T.
Washington of Alabama.
At each meeting a certain time was
given to a discussion of the claims of San
Francisco as the seat of tbe next assembly,
and it was formally announced in connec
tion therewith that the trustees had made
a decision in favor of San Francisco. Tbe
Californians gave vent to their joy at this
news in wild demonstrations, flag waving
and hurrahing.
It is said a satisfactory rate, approach
ing $50 for the round trip from Chicago,
has been guaranteed by the San Francis
cans. The convention in going to Cali
fornia will stop off one Sunday in Salt
Lake City and returning will spend a Sun
day in Tacoma and Seattle.
Speeches were made at the churches to
night by Rev. H. L. Castle, Pittsburg;
Miss Jessie Ackman, Chicago; Rev. M. B.
Troxell, Springfield; Rev. William Rader
San Fraucisco; Rev. J. W. Field. Chicago;
Rev. J. T. McCreery, Pittsburg, and W. lv
Beard, Ohio.
A communication was read from Neal
Dow.
At the churches in the city sunrise
meetings were held this morning, that at
the Central Methodist Protestant Church,
headquarters of the Californians, being
led by Harry \V. McKee of San Francisco.
A big bicycle parade is one of the fea
tures of entertainment provided for Satur
day night. Hundreds of visitors have
brought wheels with them and will take
part in the denioustration.
Among those who spoke at the various
denomination meetings this evening were:
James Hosburgb Jr., Rev. William Rader
and Rolla V. Watt of San Francisco, and
C. S. Merritt of Oakland.

Rolla V. Watt Notified at Wash

The following self-explanatory telegram
was forwarded from this City yrsterday to
Rolla V. Watt, who is now in Washing
ton:
With only a portion of the business com
munity canvassed, we have subscriptions of
nearly $ 23,000. The committee pledges the
balance to make the guarantee of $25,000
good. This is done with the expectation that
20,000 delegates will attend. The committee
further pledges whatever additional money is
necessary to take care of 50,000 or more.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 9.â Trouble
is brewing among the employes of the
electric car system 01 this city. Beveral
days ago the men were put on twelve-hour
instead of *en-hour runs.
The men are paid by the hour so that
the increase in time means an increase of
wages, bat they object to the long hours
ana to any reduction in the force of em
ployes. It is claimed that if a strike results
the whole electric system will be stopped
as the employes claim that the men at
the Folsom power-house, which belongs
to the company owning the car system,
will go out if requested. The manage
ment is confident that nothing serious
will happen, claiming that the disgrun
tled men do not number more than a
third of the force.

PORTLAND JAIL SCAM At.
Prisoners A/lowed to Go Free by a Drunken
Keeper â Three Notorious Crim
inals Escape.
PORTLAND, Ob., July 9.â Since the
new city government has come into power,
it transpires that the management of tbe
County Jail has been carried on in a dis
graceful manner.
Both Jailer Chamberlain and his trus
ties were drunk together, and it has been
found that several burglars and thugs were
allowed to go free on the day of their
SDree, their names appearing on the
records as "discharged," thougn their
sentences had not expired. The ex-Sheriff
declares that the escapes number only
three.
Among the escapes are J. W. Adams,
bigamist and thief, and Charles Gindrat
and E. 8. Bradbury, who belong to prom
inently connected families, the former be
ing highly connected in the East, and the
latter being a brother of J. K. Carter, re
ceiver of the Pacihc Bank of San Fran
cisco.
Gindrat is a doctor and is a brother oj
an eminent physician in Philadelphia.
His downfall is said to have been caused
by the use of intoxicants.
He is now supposed to be on his way to
his brother's home, and a description of
him, with instructions to arrest, has been
sent to the police of all cities through
which he is likely to pass.
Bradbury's right name is Carter. He
has had a checkered career, which was
brought to a temporary close in this city
by his arrest for larceny and his sentence
to the County Jail.
His term would have expired on Novem
ber 22 and that of Gindrat on December 2
next.
Adams, the first of the prisoners to es
cape, had been sentenced to nine months
for the larceny of jewelry from a woman
whom he had enticed into a mock mar
riage.

in the Cariboo District
Consolidated.
American and European Capital Com
bined in a Newly Organized
Corporation.
SEATTLE, Wash., July 9.â A t>lacer

men, as well as by American millionaires,
was consummated to-day in this city by
the organization oi the British Northwest
Gold Mining Company, l.mited, with a
capital of |5. 000,000.

enterprise, which is probably the largest
of its kind ever attempted in the North
west, originated with Charles F. Fishback
of Seattle, one of the leading lawyers of
this State.
It involves the consolidation of three
great placer properties in the British Co
lumbia Cariboo mining district.
They are the Fisbback mine, compris
ing 800 acreÂ« and its water system, drain
ing forty-five square miles; the Maud
Hydraulic Mining Company, of about the
same proportions, and placers on the
Quesnelle River, which is said to be the
greatest gold-bearing stream on the North
American continent. Experts sent out by
the big money men in the concern have
reported that there is $20,000,000 in sight
on one of these properties, and anotner
will produce $1200 a day for a generation.
Among others associated with Addicks
in the directorate are Edward F. J. Gay
nor. Auditor of tbe Manhattan Railway
Company; Camille Weidenfeid, of the
banking-house of Rothschild & Weiden
leld; Thomas W. Lawsen and George A.
Kelley, of New York; Charles Wilson,
Q. C. ; J. M. Buxton, of Vancouver; United

LOS ANGELES MYSTERY.
A Coroner's Jury Intimates That
Capitalist Todd Was
Murdered.
His Companion on the Fatal Hunting
Trip Now Claims Half of His
Property.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., July 9.â The ver
dict of tne Coroner's jury over the body of
Robert Todd, the capitalist, who was sup
posed to have shot himself accidentally
yesterday, failed to bear out that theory.
It says:
"We find that tbe deceased came to his
death by a wound."
The jury thus refused to concede that
the shooting was done accidentally by
himself.
The jury found that Todd must have
held his gun in the left hand, the arm ex
tendinc across the breast, to have shot
himself, as he was believed to have done.
Tnomas Leatherdale, the man who was
with Todd, says that Todd asked him for
his knife; yet when Coroner Campbell ex
amined the body he found a knife in one
of the pockets. It belonged to Todd.
It is claimed that Leatherdale had no
money or other property, yet he now
claims a half interest in several of Todd's
lines of business, amounting to nearly
$50,000. His testimony as given this
morning differs considerably from the
statements made last evening.
Woolsey Kronkite, who was driving
past, states that when he first saw the
men they were standing fully sixty feet
apart and appeared to be measuring off
land. He heard no shot, yet in tive
minutes he was hailed By Leatberdale.
The case has been turned over to the
Police Department.

The following is a statement of gains
and losses in census returns for 1896:
arrest and conviction of William Springer
was still in evidence he would produce
1 Snrin^er will never realize on his proposi-
I tion.
Springer, a fprmer saloon-keeper at Lodi,
married a German girl in San Francisco
and broueht his bride south on a wedding
tour, stopping at the Transcontinental
Hotel in Colton. There he robbed his
wife, killed her and set fire to the bed
clothing and furniture of the room, hop
ing to destroy evidence of his crime. The
fire went out.
This was in January, 1887. On Novem
ber 5. 1888, W. R. Mclntosb, while rabbit
hunting on the north side of Little Moun
tain, near Ban Bernardino, found Spring
er's body. In the clothine were a lady's
gold watch, a revolver, with one empty
chamber, and an open knife. A bullet
hole through the skull was evidence of
suicide.
At an inquest two days afterward the
clothing, which was in a good sta'e
of preservation, was identified by the
former proprietor of the hotel and a negro
Dorter. The reward tender was then in
vestigated by the finder, but nothing came
of it, because the terms did not say "dead
or alive."
SANTA ROSA-SONOMA RAILWAY.
The Two Town* to Be Connected by an
Elertnc Line.
SANTA ROBA. Cal., July 9.â Banta
Rosa and Sonoma are to be connected by
an electric railway. Rumors of this en
terprise have been in circulation here for
several months, but it is now an assured
fact.
The Board of Supervisors has been ap
pealed to for a francnise, and as soon as
this is granted work will be commenced.
The new road will connect Mellita, Ken
wood, Glen Ellen, Apua Caliente and So
noma and will probably be an overhead
trolley system.
The projectors confidently assert that
the railway will De in operation before the
expiration of this year.

Miller of Visalia were granted an audi

favor of commuting the death sentence of
John E. Howard, who is to be executed at
Folsom State Prison, to imprisonment for
life.
After listening to tbe arguments the
Governor took the case under advise

executive clemency will be extended.

GOOD SHOWING OF DICTATUS.
The Once Erratic Chestnut Cleverly
Handled by Young Clarence
Day.
NAPA, Cal., July 9.â The mercury in
the thermometer took a leap upward to
day and when the bell in the judges' stand
tapped the starters in the opening events
out the merry popping of corks from soda
water bottles sounded like target practice
on a rifle range. Indeed, the sodr. from
these noted springs seems more plentiful
than ordinary river water, for the dust on
the grounds flies around in big clouds
which a sprinkling-cart might allay.
Two of the events on to-day's card were
for district horses, but the rural visitor
must have lost interest in the trotters and
the pacers, for these kindly folk with the
little bunch of whiskers on the chin who
patronize the gineer-bread and peanut
stands and reckon well before they make a
bet, were conspicuous by their absence.
Under the grand stand in the Monte Carlo
department pain is depicted on the faces
of the different game-keepers, and the man
who has the privilege looks as though he
had troubles of his own.
The ladies with their pretty dresses and
rosy cheeks are very liberal in their pa
tronage and lend much gaiety to the
scene. A splendid band discourses popular
airs between heats.
It is always the unexpected that is hap
pening in racing, and there is sorrow to
night among the backers of Strathmont,
tut favorite for the 2:40 pace. After tak
ing two heats off the reel in clinking
fashion, each in 2:14, one of the Fresno
horse's boots became loosened in the third
heat, and he finished seventh. This
marked the beginning of his trouble, for
in the fifth heat he was distanced.
He showed phenomenal speed In the
second beat, going to the half in 1:04. and
a low mark is predicted for him before the
close of the season. Meridian, the winner
of the race, which it took six heats to de
cide, was driven by the noted reinsnian,
Dick Havey, who replaced Moorehead in
the sulky after the second heat at the lat
ter drivers request; and to Havey's mas
terly handling can be accredited the stal
lion's victory.
Paieua Hunger, driven by Charles Dur
fee, was the choice for the trotting race
for district two-year-olds, selling in the
pools for $10 against $4 for the held; but
Attractor, a good-looking youngster by
Falrose, won in straight heats in 2:41, 2:34.
The race for three-year-old district trot
tere was also taken in straight heats by
the winner, J J, who sold in tne pools for
$10 against $5 for the field and $3 for Napa
Prince. The best time made was 2:26, in
the second heat.
When pooling began on the pacing
event but one horse seemed to be in any
great demand â Strathmont. He brought
$20, with Kate H bringing $9 and the held
$8. The favorite really looked like oil out
of the can, for tie took the hrst heat like
breaking sticks in 2:14 flat, with Cora S a
good second. Kate H, the second choice,
was distanced.
The Fresno horse now sold for $10
against $3 for the entire field. He repeated
this time in the heat following, with Cora
S again second.
In the third heat a loosened quarter
boot caused the favorite to go into the air
after passing the half, and Havey got
Meridian home two lengths in front of
Cora S in 2:16^. The book laid $20 to $1
against the winner for tne heat.
It was reported that Stratnmont did not
cool out well after his two fast heats,
and hedging on the part of his
backers was now in order. Cora S,
the game and persistent daughter of
Button, captured the lourth heat in 2:20,
with Dictatus second. This latter horse
maSe a bad break at the first turn, but
later showed a marvelous burst of speed,
coming home from the half in 1:02. He
was driven to-day by Clarence Day, a son
of the horse's owner, and the young man's
handling of the erratic chestnut was the
cause of much favorable comment among
horsemen. After various professional
reinsmen had given the horse up as a bad
job. young Day took charge of him, and,
to the surprise of ail, he appeared to-day
without hobbles. He will evidently bear
watching in the future.
Before thÂ« fifth beat the field sold even
up against Strathmont, to the disgust and
horror of that horse's followers. He made
a bad break on the backstretch and was
distanced, Meridian winning the heat
easily from Cora S in 2:18.
For the final heat the last-named two
horses were the only ones to come out,
and Meridian placed the heat and race to
his credit by easily downing the gatne, but
tired mare. Time, 2:23.

HENLEY -ON- THE -THAMES, Esq.,
July 9.â The final heat for the Grand
Challenge cup between the Thames Row
ins Club and the Leander Rowing Club
was won by Leander. A strong adverse
breeze was blowing over the course, which
slightly favored the Bucks station. Lean
der won by two and a quarter lengths in
7:43.
Both boats got off at the same instant,
strikiue the water at a stroke of forty to
the minute. Thames led after half a
dozen strokes and then Leander drew np
level.
â At the end of the island Leander led by
a third of a length and by two-thirds of a
length at the Rectory, and at the mile
post was a clear length in the lead. Lean
der kept in front and reached Fawley
Court iv 3:35. Her lead was somewhat
shortened after passing Fawley Court, but
from the I -simian to the finish Leander
drew rapidly away from the Thames beat
and won handily.
Baron Guinness defeated Beaumont in
the single-scull, winning by two lengths
in 9:35.
The final heat for the Thames Challenge
cup was won by the Emanuel College,
Cambridge ci ht, who beat the crew of the
Societed'Encouragement dv Sport Nau

TRYING MONTECITO'S DEAD
County Officers Are Unable to
Prove the Guilt of
Barnard.
No Blood Found Upon His Knife or
Clothing When Under the
M crnscope.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July 9.â The
inquest over the body of the little dog
trainer, Cyrus Barnard, was concluded to
day, but the endeavor to ascertain his con
nection with the Richardson murders
proved abortive. There have been many
cases where men have been shot down
when resisting arrest for the commission
of heinous crimes. Usually their guilt has
either been a matter of wide public Knowl
edge or their complicity has been readily
proved. This is a unique case.
Although a network of snspicious cir
cumstances involve the dead man, there is
positively not one single piece of indisput
able evidence to demonstrate his complic
ity.
Last night even those who were most
zealously endeavoring to give the dead
man a fair trial, and to raise every possi
ble evidence in his defense, went to their
homes almost wholly persuaded of his
guilt and fully expected that the micro
scopic examination of Barnards shoes and
knife, which Drs. Hall and Otto had un
dertaken to make, would demonstrate the
presence of corpuscles of human blood and
establish the fact that he was the butcher
who bad slain gray-haired Mrs. Rich
ardson and her pretty daughter.
The physicians themselves expected it
To-day they reported that the most search
ing investigation proved these articles to
be free from blood. This almost broke
down the case against Barnard.
Whosoever committed these murders
walked in blood, and must have borne it
on his garments. All the clothes that
Barnard was known to possess have been
found, and there is no blood about them.
Yet the man s mean, dishonest character,
his lack of principle or worthy sentiment,
his corrupt morals, his familiarity with
the house and grounds, the desperate re
sistance of arrest before he was charged
with the crime rstablish a chain of suspi
cious facts which bring conviction to most
minds.
Sheriff Hick's directions to Hopkins
when he sent the latter to arrest Barnard
were given to the jury to-day.
"I told Hopkins to be on his guard," the
Sheriff attested, "for if Cyrus Barnard had
committed those murders he would cer
tainly shoot before he would be taken."
This advice of his superior officer justi
fies what many have regarded as reckless
shooting on the part of the arresting of
ficer, and raises from him all suspicion
that he fired upon Barnard as a result of
personal animosity or desire for a fight.
As a matter of fact Hopkins has been
feeling very dismal over the fact tnat he
has killed a man. Although he served as
city marshal of Santa Barbara for years,
and was known as a brave and fearless
officer, having made countless arrests and
handled many desperate men, this is the
first instance in which he had ever tasren
another man's life and the second time he
had ever shot any one.
The verdict of the jury, declaring the
killing not only juftifiable'but a commend
able act on the part of the officer, is gen
erally applauded.
John Murray Jr., who drifted into the
inquest as a defender of the dead man,
and who has shown himself as cool, cour
teous and keen a cross-examiner as any
lawyer, is a picturesque feature of the
case. He is the son of the somewhat cele
brated reader and elocutionist, and a few
years ago was known as the rising young
capitalist of the county, owing a block of
buildings in Santa Maria valued at $50,000.
He is finely educated and possesses a face
which impresses the most casual observer
with its beauty, purity and strength.
A year or two ago he took up socialistic
studies and, becoming imbued with these
theories, deeded all of his property away
and started out penniless to work for the
world's good and proereas. He ha 3 been
arrested and hooted at, but keeps steadily
in the path he has chosen.
Murray knew Bernard and has accepted
him as a convenient, useful and not disa
greeable companion, whom he was in the
habit of occasionally taking into the
mountains.
While he despised the man's degraded
character and life yet when he found his
acquaintance shot down and accused of a
dreadful crime of which he was helpless
to exonerate himself and saw that every
man's hand was raised against him he
voluntarily espoused the cause of the
dead. In doing this he put himself in the
most equivocal position, drawing upon
himself the indignation of good men, who
felt that he was openly posing and in a
sense accusing them of Injustice.
Yet Murray has quietly endured the ig
nominy of his position and the humiiia
tions to which ne has been more than once
subjected, and all for the sake of securing
justice for a dead man whom himself
held in contemn.
Cyrus Barnard was buried this after
noon. Only tive vehicles composed the
procession ; there were no mourners and
it was impossible to secure pallbearers.
The pretty Richardson viila out in El
Montecito is closed. All of the doors are
fastly locked and the lew movable valu
ables it contains have been locked up in a
bank vault. In a few days a male relative
of the family will arrive from the East, but
what will be done with the estate nobody
knows.

to a most distinguished company, includ
ing the Prince of Wales and his brother,
the Duke of Connaught. The banquet
was held in the King's Hall of the Hol
burn restaurant, '*'hich is one of the most
prominent places of its kind in London.
The hall was most elaborately dec
orated. Above the chair of Colonel
Walker, chairman of the banquet, were a
portrait of the Queen and the arms of the
United States, which were flanked by the
stars and stripes and the banner of the
American company.
Prior to tbe banquet there was a recep
tion, at which the hosts welcomed their
guests. To the right of the chairman sat
the Prince of Wales, Embassador Bay
ard, the Marquis of Landsdowne and
Field Marshal Sir Donald Stewart, Gov
ernor of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea.
On his left were the Duke of Connaught,
Baron Halsbury, Lord High Chancellor of
Great Britain; General Patrick Collins,
American Consul-General at London and
the Right Rev. Alfred Earle. Bishop Suf
fragan of Marlborough.
Among theoOOother guests present we're
General Sir Redvers Bullo, General Sir
Evelyn Wood, General Lord Methuen,
Major-General Sir Francis Grenfells, Major-

George Higginson, General Burnett and
General Elha, Lord Denbigh, Lord Col
ville, Sir Donald Smith, Canadian High
Commissioner to England; Hon. Chaun
cey M. Depew and Sir Henry Irving.
The members of the Boston organiza
tion were in full-dress uniform, as were
also a number of their guests. A majority
of the latter, however, were in evening
dress, wearing their orders and medfois. A
throng of ladies Jin gay toilets watched
the banqueting and listened to the
speeches from the galleries. There was an
atmosphere of enthusiasm and goodfellow
ship everywhere and the banquet was one
of the most successful of the kind ever
given.
Toasts to the Queen, the Prince and
Princess of Wales, the Ancient and Hon
orable Artillery Company, the army and
navy and Embassador Bayard were pro
posed and responded to amid the greatest
enthusiasm.

The sons of Democracy will soon be
orphans.
Hill has led one forlorn hope too many
and his funeral is now in order.
When you have joined a Republican
club yon have a right to talk politics.
Conservative Democrats are not saying
much, but tDey know what they are going
to do.
The Republican pledge to promote bi
metallism is as good as gold and as popu
lar as silver.
Whitney's visit to Europe was only
postponed. He will go now as if he were
being fired over.
An analysis of the situation shows that
the only National party now in existence
is the Republican party.
The delegates at Chicago divided their
time between standing up for silver and
sitting down on gold.
There was not a single speech made at
Chicago that Democracy will circulate as
a campaign document.
Local Democracy will appropriately rat
ify the pow wow at Chicago in two sec
tions and several fractions.
There are many bosses in evidence at
the Chicago convention, but no sign of a
leader that anybody would follow.
Now that the old Democratic ship has
been captured by pirates she will be more
dangerous to business interests than ever.
It will be instructive to watch the kind
of people who will get together to ratify
the crank work of the Altgeld convention.
Democracy has begun its career as a re
pudiation party by repudiating every one
of its own time-honored convention rules
and practice*.
The silver Democrats have so success
fully stampeded the gold men that they
will never get them back into line again
before election day.
If the Populists indorse the Chicago
ticket they must have less sense in deal
ing with noxious insects than farmers are
generally supposed to have.
Senator Daniel as a figurehead to the
convention was about as imposing and as
picturesque as a wooden Indian in front
of a Virginia tobacco-store.
"Democracy wiil live afterwe are dead,"
said Stephen M. White to the Chicago
convention, and certainly it can hardly be
expected to live before then.
If CaliTorma is to have her industries
promoted and her resources developed her
people must maintain a protective tariff
above all other issues whatever.
That the California delegation split on
the first test rote need surprise no one.
Mr. Daggett in putting it together never
intended it should stay together.
Many a man will attend the Democratic
ratification meetings just to see a free
circus with a chance of witnessing n mis
cellaneous assortment of free fights
thrown in.
The attempt of Democracy to array the
West against the East will fail utterly so
far as this State is concerned. California
is in the Union and her people will rote
with the Union.
There may be some intelligent men who
out of party spirit will vote for the Chicago
ticket, but they will have to drop their in
tellects in a slot machine before they drop
their votes in the bailot-box.
For the cause of protection and for the
sake of prosperity the peopie are rapidly
rallying to the Republican party all over
the Union and its banners wiil be carried
forward to a sweeping victory.
There is not in this country a business
man of good common-sense who would be
willing to intrust the affairs of the Nation
to the crowd that has just made Chicago
hideous by a disorderly convention.
The free-trade politicians will attempt
to array labor against capital and. the
"West against the East on the Bilver ques
tion, and it is the duty not only of all pro
tectionists but of all business men and all
patriots to oppose them and defeat them.
The attempt of George Fred Williams
of Massachusetts to take the sectional
color off the Chicago convention was ' a
failure. It takes more than one man to
represent the great States of the East, and
despite the silver oratory of the "Massa
chusetts man every one who has studied
the convention knows the East was not
in it.
A DANGEROUS COALITION.
All reports from Chicago reveal the fact
that the dominant power in the convention
is a coalition of free-traders and free-silver
monometallists. This coalition has organ
ized a sectional party made up of the old
secession leaders of the South and the dis
contented elements of the West, and de
signs to put into power an administration
adverse to the business and industrial in
terests of the great manufacturing States
of the Union. Incidentally it is also a
class party and seeks to excite labor against
capital, the farmer against the manufac
turer and the debtor against the creditor.
The object, of course, is to establish free
trade on the ruin? of American industry,
train office and power for men like Tillman,
Altgeld, Bland and others of like character,
and create a condition of civil disturbance
out of which demagogues of all classes
and degrees could hope for profit and re
ward.
The cry of free-silver coinage by such a
coalition is simply an attempt to take ad
vantage of a great popular movement and
mislead it. To restore bimetallism in this
country without injury to business and
industry will require a statesmanship not
inferior to that which conducted the
finances of the Nation during the war and
afterward restored specie payment. It re
quires the administrative skill of men like
Lincoln, Chase, Grant. Sherman, Garfieid
and Blame. It requires, moreover, that
such administrators should have the sup
port and co-operation of strong majorities
of conservative, sagacious, loyal and patri
otic men in both branches of Congress.
To attempt to restore bimetallism through
the men in control at Chicago, with the aid
of Populist allies, would be to bring about
confusion worse confounded and to restore
the "reign of chaos and old night."
Conservative men of all parties have
begun to recocnize the responsibilities that
rest upon them at this juncture. The
people of this country, so long as they re
tain common-sense and an ordinary degree
of patriotism, will not countenance either
sectional parties or class parties. We have
had an experience of what results from
the one and we will not venture an experi
ment with the other. The truest advo
cates of bimetallism will sustain it only
when it becomes a National instead of a
sectional demand and when its restoration
can be undertaken by statesmen and pa
triots and not by agitators and demagogues.
We are not among those who believe the
Democratic party.will perish in this cam
paign. A party that has vitality enougn
in its principles and its organization to
survive the heresy of secession is not going
to perish from the heresy of free trade.
There will be this year, however, a repeti
tion of what occurred when Democracy
became sectional in 1860. The conserva
tive elements of the country will stand
together. The voice of the Pacific will
answer the voice of the Atlantic. Oregon
will vote as Maine votes and California
will aad her strength to that of Massa
chusetts. Our interests are identical with
those of the great manufacturing States,
with th 6 great commercial cities, with the
Union as a whole. That we favor bimet
allism is beyond question, but we favor
protection first, for industry must precede
money. Moreover we are for the Union
and the whole people. Class parties and
sectional parties will iind no support in
California. ___^______
PROTECTION AID REOIPBOOITY.
A few Democrats who are unenlightened
think they see a glaring contradiction in
the Republican party's declaration for
"protection and reciprocity," Decause reci
procity means free trade and protection
means exactly the opposite. But no sensi
ble man would commit such a blunder,
for there is no contradiction at all nor
could antagonism between tne two decla
rations be discovered if viewed from a
common-sense business standpoint. Reci
procity certainly does mean free trade, but
not the kind of free trade that the Demo
cratic party clamors for. When Air. Mc-
Kinley is President, strong efforts will be
made to establish reciprocal trade relations
between the United States and countries
whose products are different from ours.
Wherever our traders can find commodity
interchange profitable they certainly
should have free course with such coun
tries.
Practically all the Latin-American
states produce articles of commerce which
would not come in hurtful competition
with our industries, and with all such
countries we should have free-trade rela
tions, and we shall have them after this
year. There are other countries besides
South and Central America with whom
reciprocal trade intercourse would be
highly advantageous to us, and in time
such relations will be established. It is a
mistake to suppose that protection means
National exclusiveness. The policy of the
Republican party is to foster all of our in
dustries in proportion as they may need
tions, and we shall have them after this
year. There are other countries besides
South and Central America with whom

dustries in proportion as they may need
such fostering, and it also means the fos
tering of close commercial relations with
all countries with whom such relations
would be beneficial to our people. The
tariff and reciprocity doctrines of the Re
publican party stand for and demand the
greatest possible good to the people of the
United States, and where protection is
needed there protection will be found, and
where reciprocal trade intercourse will se
cure to us good and substantial returns
there reciprocity will be found in practical
application. First and foremost, the Xe
publican party ii for Americans and
America's best interests, and whatever is
right, whatever is just and whatever is
equitable will be employed in the interests
of the people of the United States.
DEMOCRATIC DECLARATIONS.
The platform of the Democratic party
as finally adopted by the Chicago conven
tion is as queer as it is contradictory. It
is a radical departure from many of the
principles enunciated by the fifteen pre
ceding National conventions, except as to
the spoils of om'ce, which it heartily in
dorses under the very thin guise of "we
favor appointments based upon merit"
and "equal opportunities to all citizens of
ascertained fitness." This may be con
sidered as giving notice in advance that
"to the victors belong the spoils," and
that every one who works faithfully for
the election of the candidates will be re
warded by an opportunity to feast at the
public crib. This declaration is a bold
thrust at the civil service law, and its re
peal is promised.
The next declaration of importance is
the one which promises a law that shall
deprive one of the right to make a con
tract for the liquidation of a note or other
indebtedness, and specify the kind of
money that the obligation s-iall be re
deemed in. But the noxt declaration con
fuses this one by the demand that "the
power to issue notes to circulate as money
be taken away from the National banks,
and that all paper money shall be
issued by the Treasury Department, be
redeemable in coin and receivable for
all debts, public and private." The second
declaration annuls the first one, or the
first one annuls the second one. If gold
and Bilver coin is the redemption money
of the country it follows that paper money
would not be a legal tender, nor could it
be made bo. A tender of paper money
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
could legally be refused by the tenderer,
which would oblige the tender to go to
the National treasury and exchange his
paper for gold or silver. Had the plat
form designated paper money as token
money, and recommended its issue by the
Government for the convenience of the
people, or had it said that the Govern
ment has the right to stamp gold, silver or
paper with its seal and declare such
stamped things legal tender money, the
declaration would have some meaning,
but as it is it contradicts itself in the most
bungling way.
Referring to the tariff the platform says
that "tariff duties should be levied for the
purpose of revenue." Inasruucn as the
present Democratic tariff has failed in
three years by nearly $140,000,000 to sup
ply ti.e necessary revenue to maintain
the expense account of the country
the inference is that the Democratic
party is in favor of re-enacting the
McKiniey law, because that law dem
onstrated its ability to provide ample
revenue, just as the 'Wilson-Gorman
act has demonstrated its inability to sup
port the Government. This is a confession
thai the present tariff schedules need to
be increased, which is true, fey the reason
that the Government needs more revenue,
and for another reason that when custom
house charges are sufficient to provide the
necessary revenue there is also enough
protection to our industries. But that ia
not what the Democratic party means, as
will be seen in another plank of its plat
form. The real purpose is to establish the
principle that the people should support
the Government by money raised by an
income tax â not by taxing the incomes of
the rich alone, but by taxing the earnings
of every one. With such a law in force
the party believes a very close approach to
free trade could be made. The Supreme
Federal Court has already declared that
an income tax is unconstitutional, but the
Chicago platform provides for that dj- the
way the court will hereafter "be consti
tuted."
The plank next to the last oue reveals
the sectional feeling which dominated the
convention. This plank declares for the
improvement of "the Mississippi River
and other great waterways, so as to secure
for tlie interior Slates easy and cheap
transportation to tidewater." No refer
ence is made to the improvement of any
harbor, coast defenses nor anything else
that would not directly benefit "the in
terior States.' 1 The Mississippi Vailey,
including the old slave States, was very
much in evidence in the convention, and
ex-slave-owners under Altgeld's leadership
rode roughshod over the Atlantic and Pa
cific Coast countries.
REGISTER AT ONCE.
The first duty of Republicans at this
time is to register their names on the list
of voters. All other political duties de
pend on that. Until a man haa registered
he has not made sure of his right to vote.
He cannot with consistency urjre others to
the performance of their obligations as
citizens until he has put himself in a po
sition to perform bis own.
At the present time registration is going
on very slowly. There are no crowds in
the registration office. No one has to wait
long. It requires very little trouble and
time for the citizen to have his re?istra
tain made under these circumstance*.
Later on there will be a ruÂ«h at the office.
Crowds will be standing round the desks.
Then those who come will have to wait.
It is, therefore, the part of wisdom for
business men to register at once. Better
attend to the duty wnen it can be per
formed with ease, convenience and prompt
ness than to delay until the last moment
and then be compelled to submit to con
siderable crowding and annoyance and
loss of time.
The Republican ciub* of this City should
make it a part of their to see
that all Republicans in their districts are
registered. Bring out the voters. Unless the
full voting strength of the party is on the
voting list it will ko badly with the party
on election day. Clearly the pressing po
litical duty of the day ia to register your
self and then see that other Republicans
are registered. Attend to it to-diy.
A BUSINESS BAROMETER.
The railway is the most reliable busi
ness barometer. When our railways are
having liberal offerings of freight the pas
senger business is large and industry is
prosperous, but when their cars stand
empty on side tracks there is distress in
every avenue of trade distribution and
employment. The expenditure of the rail
ways as a whole on account of operation
and maintenance absorbs not less than 75
per cent of the cross receipts, and scarcely
a line, of manufacture is exempt from re
ceiving direct benefit. Fully 50 per cent of
the gross revenue of a railway is disbursed
in the towns on its line, and the other 25
per cent of the total outgo is distributed
among manufacturers of railway supplies
all over the country, which in turn goes to
the pockets of the wageman and from
thÂ«nce to the merchant, i
The Pennsylvania Railway Company's
gross earnings amount to more than $140,
--000,000 a year when business is good, and
considerably over $100,000,000 of it is paid
out to its employes and to shops and fac
tories located immediately upon its own
mileage. When the volume of freight is
small and passenger travel light, hundreds
of men are laid off and scores of trains
taken from the time schednle. The pay of
the men stops, which in turn ia reflected in
the sales of the way-station storekeepers
and in the output of furnace and factory.
When men are "laid off" on a great mil
way it means that more are to be "laid off"
in every millshop and factory from which
the road buys supplies, and if it be a coal
and coke carrying road there is enforced
idleness in the coal mines and at the coke
ovens.
In fact, it is hard to tell where the in
fluence of a great railway for individ
ual discomfort ends when the condi
tion of trade and commerce obliees it
to retrench. Not only the retail merchant
suffers, but all from whom he buys sup
plies, from the farmer to the manufac
turer, feel the loss which "laying off " by
the railway inflicts upon its operatives.
And all must wait for the railway to re
sume the running of its trains and for the
payday of its re-employed operatives.
When one stops to think of the distress
that is inflicted. upon a country, and the
almost limitless ramifications of the harm
done by such .. business depression as this
country, has been facing for three or more
years, it would seem that every one would
feel it to be his highest duty to his fellow
countrymen to â do all that is in his power
to avert such another calamity.
For three years there nas been enforced
inactivity throughout every channel of
industry, commerce and transportation in
tun ; United States, and there ' is an un
natural cause for it, for in the preceding
yearsâ a decade, we might sayâ there was
satisfying â¢ prosperity which created no
conditions for such an onslaught upon the
business interests rof the â  country. The
cause, as every one should know, is to be
found in a most unwise and ignorant ef
fort to cast aside . well-established business
principles and introduce theories of tariff
and finance which, Ua?e never been baqc
tioned by the business experience of any
people. These wild and senseless Heories
are still in practical operation. The people
know to their sorrow how ruinous to them
they have been, and it would seem that
every one wno is not satisfied with such
conaitions and wno longs for opportunity
to again employ hig skill and brain and
brawn would know that the country must
return to the economic policy that the
present one supplanted before substantial
prosperity will return to the country.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS
Walter Malms Rose of Ontario, Cal., carried
off first prize this year at the Cornell Law
School for the best treatise dealing with some
legal subject requiring personal research.
His thesis was upon water-front cases in
the United States.
The second prize was awarded to Orrin Dale
Richardson, son of Judge Richardson of Evans
ville, Ind. Both Rose and Richardson were
students in the law department at Stanford
University last year. Richardson was first a
student at Indiana University, where he was
graduated from the English department then
in charge of Professor E. W. (iriggs. But as
soon as Professor Griggs was recalled to Stan
ford to take the chair of ethics, Richardson,
like several other Indiana students, followed
that favorite teacher to the Pacific Coast and
took work leading to the degree ol master of

hundred men from all parts of the country in
the Cornell Law School and that there were
sixty-live In the graduating class with these
two Stanford men, the compliment to the
efficiency of the training they received at Palo
Alto is evident The plan at Stanford Univer
sity is for each student to specialize upon the
work of a particular department. To that he
devotes one-third of his time. The remaining
time is spent upon courses in other depart
i ments, but no regular student can narrow
down to one course of study. Ro?e, for in
stance, made history his major study, and
took economics, law, English and several other
subjects calculated to give a broader legal
training than could be obtained at a school
where law alone is studied.
Walter Rose not only earned his own way
throu?h Stanford, but he paid his expenses at
Cornell by work done during the preceding
summer vacation and while pursuing his
studies at Ithica, N. Y. At Palo A.to he was
known as a hard student, but no one ever
considered him a "dig," for he found time for
other things than his books. Employed as as
sistant in the library he spent a part of each
day at work there, and yet he completed
the four years' course six months ahead of his
class. Hewas also business manager for one
term of the Sequoia, the college weekly, and
the next term was elected editor, both of
which positions furnished an income of about
$00 a month. He was one of the early work
ers on the staff of the Daily Palo Alto, corre

one of the charter members of the Stanford
Press Club. He was one of the founders of the

GRACEFUL ACT BY ALLISON.

Senator Allison performed a graceful act in
wiring to Major McKinley his "sincere and
hearty congratulations" on the result of the
St. Louis convention. lowa .Republicans are
not the sort that sulk in their tents, and Sena
tor Allison is one of the noblest of them all.
Ills campaign for the nomination was con
ducted on a nigh plane, without bitterness or
detraction. Senator Allison and his friends,
by their high-minded course, have won the re
spect and admiration of the entire country.
BEET SUGAR.
Xew York Mall and Express.
The extensive scheme of Claus Spreckels for
the Introduction of beet-root culture in Cali
fornia will, if successful, cause a sweeping
revolution in the sugar industry in this coun
try. The success of beet-root sugar-making
In Germany, of which Mr. Spreckels has just
completed an exhaustive stndy, has convinced
him that it can be profitably undertaken in
the West, and if his conclusions are supported
by actual results in the experiments he pro
poses, the whole business in this important in
dustry will be radically changed. To be able
to produce at home all the sugar consumed in
this country would relieve the people of the
burden of one of the largest items in our im
ports. The success of the undertaking would
be another step towird the complete indus
trial independence of the United States.
NO MORE DEMOCRACY.
Placer Argus.
We do not believe that eight-ninths of the
Republican convention that adopted the
financial plank of the platform did bo at the
behest of Wall street or any other combination
in the world. We do not believe that men of
the character of Lodge, Depew, Foraker, Hast
ings, Fairbanks and Thurston represented
anything but their honest convictions in the
matter ot the financial policy of the country.
For another thing, we do not believe that the
currency question is the question above all
others before the people. We do believe that
the tariff and labor questions are the ques
tions above all others. If every dollar of the
seigniorage and all the silver bullion of the
country were coined, and all the bullion that
would be sure to be dumped at
our mints by present resumption were
coined, we do not believe that it would afford
any great relief in the matter of furnishing
labor to the unemployed or start up one of the
tied-up spindles of our idle factories.
The facts are these: The substitution of
the Wilson sugar trust tariff for the McKinley
tariff gave such ar impulse to importers that
it has led to a constant drain of the gold from
our treasury. For every dollar of imported
goods some laborer was compelled to suffer.
A return to some beneficent j.rotective system
similar to the McKtnley tariff would very soon
bring a return of trade balances in our favor.
Gold would morn to us instead of going all
one way, the payment of the public debt
would be resumed, dormant industries would
again waken to activity and we would Tery
soon be in a condition to secure international
comity in the matter of cuiu ratios lor a re
sumption of silver coinage.
To what sort of a feast doss the Bee invite?
Simply this: It invites to the hazard of a con
tinuance ,01 Democratic supremacy. It mat
ters little under what head the Democracy
poses, whether "free silver" or "sound money,' 1
it is the same old rotten hulk still. It* name
has grown to be the synonyn of disaster. Its
stench is the stench of dead" issues. Its record
that of wildcat currency, free trade wage
rates, practical repudiation, boneless Amer
ican policy. No, our dear neighbor, go where
you please, take your kites and balloons with
you, but, if you please, no more Democracy in
ours.

LETIERS FROM THE PEOPLE-
DEMOCRACY'S BLUNDER.
Seeking Porui-tsr Votes Throcgh Delvsiv*
Mo>ey Planks.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sin:
Assuming the correctness of the telegraphic
reports of the Democratic platform adopted at
Chicago to-day, in wuich the attempt is
boldly made to construct a platform which
will win Populist votes, I desire to point out
the blunder thus made and suggest some of
the consequences which will iollow as the re
sult of that blunder.
The particular plank in the new Democratic
platform to which I wish to direct special at
tention at this time is thus reported by tele
graph :
"Congress alone has power to coin and
issue money, and President Jackson declared
that this power could not be delegated to cor
porations or individuals. We therefore de
nounce the issue of notes as money by National
banks as in derogation of the constitution, and
we demand that all paper which is made legal
tender for public and private debts, or which
is receivable for dues to the United States,
shall be issued by the Government of the
United States and shall be redeemable in
coin."
The reference to the National banks is weak
and perfunctory compared with the clean-cut
and decisive declaration on this point in the
plank as first adopted by the committee, which
| said simply: "We demand that the power to
if sue notes to circulate as money be taken from
the National banks, and that nil paper money
shall be issued directly by the Treasury Depart
ment [and] be redeemable in coin and receiv
able for all dfbts, public and private." The
dread power of the ''"National" banks (private
Dtinfcs, in fact, with a. "National" name) is
sadly revealed in the change from revoking
their power to issue "notes" to circulate as
money to merely "denouncing" such issue.
Already the new Democracy has ignobly
yielded to the pressure of the bank power,
even before it had adopted its platform. lam
not much surprised, but I am mortified and
alarmed, for these "silver" Democrats are my
countrymen aud they know the right, as we
! have seen in their first declaration, demanding
I that the power to issue notes now granted to
I these bunks shall be abrogated; but though
i they know the right they dare notmaintalu it.
| This fatal and pitiable weakness, disclosed in
1 the yielding to bank influence, is notice to the
I couutry that the Democracy is still ruled by
i the fatality which always leads it to do the
wrong thing at the right time.
But why should the old historical "hard
money" party take up and meddle with the
question of paper money Â»t this time of
frenzied devotion to silver? The need and the
hope of obtaining Populist votes and of hold
| ing back those who are ready to go over to the
I Populists compelled the Democracy to yen
; ture on making this radical departure in first
"demanding" the revocation of tna authority
; unconstitutionally granted to these falsely
| called "National" banks ana then in "de
nouncing" them "as in derogation of the
i constitution," but ignoiuinously failing to de
l mand the repeal of that unconstitutional grant
; of wwer which they sonorously and preten
| tiously denounce. But what will it avail
| them? Their empty denunciation simply
I points to the fact that they recognize a gigan
tic and overshadowing evil permitted to stand
J and thrive under color of law, but which they
! dare not undertake to destroy by repealing
I the iniquitous law which created and sus
taius it.
| is Democracy in 1896â that is, what is
left on it. As usual, it has committed a fatal
blunder. At first in express terms, and then
by delusive indirection, it concedes the Jus
tice of the Populist contention, heretofore so
j much ridiculed by borh old parties, that the
! National banks are founded In a dangerous
j grant of power, which, under the constitution
can only be invoked by the National Govern-
I ment, and that these bauks have grown so
rich and powerful as to control the Govern
ment in iv executive, legislative and judiciary
departments, as well as to dictate the plat
forms and nominations of the dominant politi
cal parties, control the newsservice and edi
torial columns of the great newspapers and
other means of forming and directing public
opinion.
Having conceded this contention of the Pop
ulists, who from the first have proposed to
destroy this gigantic evil, root and branch, we
behold the Democracy too impotent to declare
â  with the Populists tnut this evil power must
be destroyed, but it is only "denounced." I*
the Democratic party, with all its new zeal and
I resounding professions, in a position to com
mand the confidence of the people in the pres
ent crisis and universal alarm? I think not
The Nation will now look to the Populist and
Ml ver conventions about to meet in St. Louis
for such a stand against the money and mon
opoly powers as will insure the overthrow of
these powers at the polls in November.
The Democracy hus unwittingly done good
service at the Chicago convention. It has con
fessed that the Populists are right in their
tight against the money power, and thus has
pointed to the open door of entrance to the
Populist party where men of courage an d eon.
viction may be found who will fight for their
rights and never lay down their arms till vic
tory is won and the people are free.
I look for large accessions from the Democ
racy to the People's party. There are genuine
patriots in the ranks of the poor old party wno
can find no assurance that they will be able to
save their country by votln? the present Demo
cratic ticket, and they will now turn tothene-v
j and defiant party of the people with the certain
| assurance that their hopes will notbedisan
j pointed, and that there is no danger now thaÂ»
i they will lose their votes. More blind parti
sans, a million or two porhaps, will vote for
the last Presidential candidates of Democracy
in the coming election. '

WILL CRUSH OUT
ALL OPFOSITION,
The Southern Pacific Com
pany Is Out on the
Warpath.
1
AFTER BAY BUSINESS.
"Spotters" Are in All Seaboard
Towns and a Careful
Tally Is Kept
SMALL STEAMERS MUST RETIRE
Nothing on the Front Is Too Small
for the Octopus to
Strike At
There is nothing so small in the shape
of opposition that the Southern Pacific
will not fight, and every steamer on the
bay is made aware that the octopns is alive
and active. Every merchant or dealer in
Napa, who sends goods to or receives goods
Irom San Francisco by the steamers Zin
fandel and Napa City, are known to the
railroad agents, and every now and again
they get a gentle reminder to the effect
that it would be to their interests to
patronize the railroad.
The steamer Alviso that runs to Alviso
and the Sunol and Monticello that run
daily to Vallejo are watched morning and
evening and every person who travels by
either boat is noted and his or her name
jotted down for reference. In this way
not only the merchants, but the traveling
public aiso, are intimidated.
Tag is also kept on the Hope, running
to Berkeley, Caroline to Baden, Gerard C
to Redwood City and the little Ida to
Suisun. In every instance the corpora
tion makes special rates by rail to meet
the opposition by water, but nevertheless
the steamers hang on, although in some
instances it is a loosing game both for tne
railroad and the oppositi n.
One of the lines that the octopus is de
termined to crush is that operated by Joe
Parra. Joe owns tne launch Ida and he
carries freight to Suisun for $1 a ton.
People who patronize him have been
warned again and again, but as the lowest
rate offered by the railroad was $2 45 a
ton Joe was kept pretty busy. His buxom
wife helps him in tbe loading and unload
ing of the vessel and a iwelve-yaar-old boy
steers the small craft, so that his expenses
are nominal. Nevertheless, the Southern
Pacific has pushed the boycott so hard
that latterly he has been compelled to ac
cept outside jobs in order to make a liv
ing. The Ida is only about 5 tons bnr
den, so the railroad must be hard pressed
when it descends to righting such an insig
nificant craft. But as Agent White at the
ferries says, "Every little helps," and the
Southern Pacific is determined to hold on
to everything in sight and "charge all the
traffic will bear."
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
j Mexico is again ready for service. She
lias been refitted throughout and is now
one of the handsomest vessels in the fleet. |
Her first run will be to San Diego in the
Corona's place, while the latter will suc
ceed the Pomona on the Eureka route.
The Pomona will then be laid up to be in
spected and have new canvass put over her
decks.
J. W. Leonhart and bride will be passen
gers on the Australia for Honolulu to
morrow. They were married in Chicago
and some of their friends amused them
selves in the railroad station by stenciling
remarks on the trunks. There are four of
' them and quite a crowd surrounded them
! all of yesterday as they lay on the Oceanic
; dock. On one was marked, ''Bride's
j trunK; just married and very shy." On
i another, "Groom's trunk; only one world,
j two people in it, wifey and I." On a third,
; in big blue lettering, was, "This end is
I dovey's, this end is duckey's," and on the
i fourth, "Handle with care. Hallelujua!
jAu revoir. Alice, John, Grace, Carl, Gar
ner, Glen."
At yesterday's meeting of the Harbor
Commissioners Chief Wharfinger Root
asked for a gnsolinc launch. He ex
plained that in boarding vessel* in the lair
way and making inspections of whftrves
one was absolutely necessary. The Com
missioners were in favor of having a
J launch built, and tbe matter was referred
| to the chief engineer to report upon.
Gallaway, Townley & Co. are in trouble
j with the commission. They have the con-

i secretary was instructed to notify tlie
I bondsmen that they would be held liable
j for the delay.
J. H. Freese, the oldest saloon-keeper
' on the water front, has gone out of busi
ness. Yesterday he >-old out his interest
I to his partner, and East street will know
him no more. Over twenty years a^o
Freese bought out his employer and ever
since has run the place in conjunction
with his partner, C. W. J. Miller.
THE LABOR UNIONS.
The Building Trades Will Draft n New
Mechanics' Lien Law.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last evening a special committee
was appointed to draft a new mechanics'
lien law which the council will present to
the next Legislature for passage, it is
claimed that the present lien law affords
no protection to the mechanic, and that
unscrupulous contractors and property
owners can avoid the payment of just
debts for work performed. The council
hereafter will meet in the rooms o: the
j Labor Bureau Association at 91534 Market

The newly elected officers of the Coopers'

Major Washington Blackhurst played a
fine Mark Anthony last night for Com
mander Ballington Booth. His appear
ance was before an audience gathered in
the Central Methodist Church, and his
purpose, as he made perfectly clear in his
first few remarks, was to paraphrase
Shakespeare â to praise Commander Booih,
and not to bury mm.
He further emphasized bis Mark An-
Major Washington Blackhurst (Balilngton Booth's Volunteers of America).
Tony-like mission by referring to the
charges of undue ambition made against
Commander Booth and then urdertakiug
to refute them and to show that tbe leader
of the "Volunteers of America," the
rival organization of the Salvation Army,
was devoted to the cause of Jesus Christ
and the sinners of the earth, and like
Caesar had nobly and heroically refused a
crown.
He also went into the causes for the de
fection of the commander, as he in tones
of affection referred to Ballinjrton Booth,
and the origin of the Volunteers of
America, the American organization com
posed of the seceders from the Salvation
Army, which has it--* headquarters (a Lon
don, with General William Booth, the
father of the commander, at its head.
Major Blackhurst had his audience,
which nearly filled the nave and gallery
of the edifice, and which showed a gener
ous sprinkling of Salvation Army mem
bers, with him from the start.
When the two verses and the chorus had
been duly rendered, Captain Gardner Biig
eested : "Let's clap it out this time. All
together." And the chorus was repeated
to the clapping of hands. "Let the ladies
sing it by the.nselves,' he then remarkei,
and the ladies promptly responded". "Now
all together," and all toother to hand
clapping the "catchy" lines were again
rendered.
After a brief prayer Captain Gardner
who is the leaner of the local seceders
from the Salvation Army, spoke a few
words on his position.
"I am thoroughly satisfied," he said
"with the step I have taken. 1 want it
understood that it was not taken impul
sively, but only after I feit it was the only
honest thing I could do. So y.m see me
here to-night as a Volunteer of America."
He introduced Mnjor Blackhurst, ex
plaining that the major was formerly pri
vate secretary to Bngaoier Fielding, for
merly of the Salvation Army and now of
the Volunteers, and had also been for a
lonir time very close to Commander and
Mrs. Booth. He concluded by saying,
"All woo are glad to see him say 'Amen.'" 1
Responses appeared to come from almost
every one present. The major's advance
to the front of 'he platform was greeted
with loud and long hand-clapping.
P"lw;mt to pay this right at the start:
There is no antipathy on my part to t.he
old movement, and I know from personal
contact with the commander what his
wishes are in this rfgard. H â¢â  desires
nothing to be said or done that might
injure the cause, and he sets the example
himself. [Applause.]
"I am not here to -eek any one to come
to us. We are . all volunteers, and who
comes must come of his own accord and
through his own convictions. No under
handed means will be employed. It is not
our intention to draw from the old organi
zation, but to recruit from the wide field
before us.
*'I am very sorry that misrepresenta
tions should have been made regarding
our cause and regarding Commander and
Mrs. Booth. If you believed all that has
been said you would certainly think they
have degenerated and fallen from grace,
and I therefore feel it my duty to vindi
cate them before the American people.
The commander's course has not been
actuated by selfish motives or by personal
ambition.
'â¢That the general should have said that
the commander had fallen beneath flat
tery- and temptation was a cause of great
surprise and sorrow to the commander
and his wife. But it is false and untrue.
"It was a great mistake and resulted
from false reports made by interested par
ties to the general, who should at least
first have investigated them before he
charged his son with wrongful ambition.
"The commander told the truth as
straight and strongly when the rich were
among his hearers as at any other time,
and nÂ«ver sought to pandor to them."
"While things were in a state of unrest,
caused by the attitude of the general, it
I was urged upon the commander by many
Salvation Army leaders," explained Major
Blackhurst, "to assume the independent
I command of the American branch of the
! Army, but after a period of prayer
; he refused the proffered crown, as he be
lieved such a course would not be honor
-1 able or right." Continuing he said :
''People wonder what are the real issues
; in the case. Some seem to have an idea it
was a question of obedience. It was not.
- It was not a question of the commander's
unwillingness to leave lhis country. It
wa^ not a question of being a soldier, for
he had obeyed orders for years past."
The mnjor stated that a letter had been
1 sent to London by. Ballington Booth c^n-
t.iining a list of twenty-two grievances
which he desired to have remedied.
Booth's refusal to co to London, be added,
was not a resignation or a repudiation of
the old movement, but he felt he could
serve no longer in the cause until the
grievances had been settled.
"He had lost confidence in the general,"
he went on, "and in the international sys
tem of administration, and felt that the
arbitrary administration of the general
would not succeed in this country."
At great length and in detail be showed
the rlifW<; n( .e in the spirits of t lie people
Of KiiKland and of the United State*, ami
declared that the latter would not stand
tne ordering about and the domineering
of the Londo" office, while to the Ensjl:sh
Mich treatment, owing to the prevalence
of caste in Great Britain, was taken as a
matter of course. He closed with a clever
appeal to th<Â» feelings of right and liberty,
which he said were apparent in tbe Ameri
can, and begged for ihe support of his
hearers for the cause lie represented. Mrs.
Booth, he said, world probably make a
visit to the coast early in November next.
In order more speedily to organize the
work and get it established in the City
Major Bliickhiirst ha& decided that Staff
Capiain Gardner shall at once devote his
energies to the consummation of the
plans. The staff captain will taKe charge
of the post soon to be opened and is au
thorized to receive money donations for
this purpose.
It is proposed in connection with this to
organize a military training school, which
will also be under his supervision.
To accomplish this will necessitate the
expenditure of $500, and interested friends
â understanding it means a new start â
will kindly resr>ond. An estimate care
f illy prepared will be pre?entei!. Major
Biaeknorti will return in aboui two weeks
and formally open the post. He will then
permanemlv establish his battalion head
quarters In the meantime Staff Captain
Gardner will be found at 526 Kearny street.

HICKMAN TELLS
OF A COMBINATION
Story of the Druggist
. of the County
Hospital.
EXTRAVAGANT CHARGES
Ad Investigation by the Board
of Health Is Now
Under Way.
BIG SAVINGS COULD BE MADE.
Chief Engineer William Carson Says
the Boilers Are So O.d They
Are Dangerous.
W. N. Hickman. druggist at the City
and County Hospital, made some sensa
tional statements at tbe investigation of
hospital affairs that was resumed before
the Board of Health yesterday morning.
He was answering a running fire of ques
tions relating to the drugs and instru
ments Used at tne institution, and in ex
planation of the fact that last month's bill
for these materials was lower than those
of previous periods said that he thought
that the "combination" must have broken
up.
"What combination is that?" asked Dr.
Hart hastily, after a startled glance had
passed between the physicians.
"Well, I'm not certain," said Hickman,
"but I think it is between the wholesale
houses of Redington & Co., Meek & Co.
and Langley, Michaels & Co. These firms
usually alternate in securing the contract
for supplies,. which is let every month. Tt
has been the custom for two houses to put
in high bids, and the one whose turn it is
to get the contract is a low one."
"It looks prearranged, then, does it?"
asked Dr. Hart.
â¢'Yes, it does. Last month a couple of
Eastern houses put in bids. Ttiey were
about 7 pec cent higher than Mack & Co."
The talk of combinations did not any
further at this time, but the board will
delve deeper into :hc subject in the future.
The witness declared tne prices paid for
drugs are extravagant and t'lat 10 per cent
or more could be saved by buying in the
open market rather than under the pres
eni contract system.
"What was the entire expense of drugs
and surgical goods for tho hospital last
year?" asked Dr. Hart.
"About $9000."
"Do you look over all drug bills?"
"I do."
"Have yon noticed any extravagant
prices?"
"I have. Drugs have been purchased
far in excess of the market price. Bottles
and corks can be purchased at from 50 to
100 per cent less than was paid."
The witness then stated that excessive
prices have been charged for codeine, as
nigh as $3 50 to $5 an ounce having been
paid.
"Wtiat could you have bought it for'"
was asked.
The witaeH gave figures showing he
could h:iÂ»e bought codeine from 50 to
60 cents an ounce less than tne figures
at which the City secured the drup.
According to the druggist's estimate he
could save about $5j a year on that one
article.
Carbolic acid, ground linseed, opium,
creosote, clinical thermometers, subnitrate
of bismuth, ether, chloroform and absorb
ent cotton were also mentioned as articles
on which a large saving could be made.
He believed that if he were given the
purchasing of the wines, liquors and
drugs he would make a saving of $1500 a
year at least.
William Carson, the chief engineer of
the hospital, testified that the coal received
was not only alwrps full weight, but some
time* over weight. No amount of ques
tioning could bring out any suggestion of
jobbery in the matier of coal.
Engineer Carson testified, however, that
the boilers ami pipe system were in a con
dition absolutely rian^eruat*, and on ex
plosion at any time would not surprise
niin.

A LINE DRAWN
ON CHINESE,
The Manufacturers Take a
Strictly White Labor
Stand.
THEIR NEW TRADEMARK
Those Who Employ Mongolians
Cannot Use It on Their
Goods.
THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTION
It M-y Cause Trouble but the Asso
ciation Wil Not Go Against
Public S'.n'iment.
No member of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association who in any way
employs Chinese can use the association's
home-industrs' trademark on his goods.
This rdict went forth yesterday at the
meeting of the directors.
The trademark committee, consisting
of J. W. Kerr, A. Darnharn and S. H.
Tacy recommended the following rules
and regulations, which were adopted:
The trademark shall be permitted onlvon
articles ol California manufacture or produc
tion.
The use of the trademark shall be limited to
members of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association of California in good standing.
License signed by the president and >i nested
by the seere Uiry shall be issued to members,
entitling them to the use of the trademark for
one year.
It shall be compulsory upon all members
using the trademark to put their name and ad
dress on the goods in conjunction with said
trademark.
Applications shall be made in writing by
members desiring to use the trademark, and it
shall be fully stated In said application how,
where aud upon what goods the use of the
trademark is contemplated.
Members found to be using the trademnrk
upon articles other than those stated in said
license, or on articles not of California manu
facture or production, shall be expelled from
the association and the license be canceled.
Any person or. persons found to be using said
truden.ark without license from this associa
tion shall be prosecuted according to law. â  * *
It was J. W. Kerr who sprung the Chi
nese question by asking if the trademark
committee would be authorized to issue
the trademark to California manufactur
ers who employ Chinese in the manufac
ture of goods. H. J. Crocker suggested
that such a matter could be held in abey
ance for a time. This brought out M. J.
Keller, who said: "'I know where there
are several manufacturers who keep a few
white people for display purposes so they
can say that they emii.oy white labor,
while at the same time they have twenty
five to fifty MoneoJians doing most of the
work. This is not fair to tne public."
"That may be true," answered Mr.
Crocker, "but can we dictate to the manu
facturers as to how and Dy whom their
goods shall he made? We are treading on
delicate ground. By discriminating among
our members an*i by saying that this man
may use tbe trademark and that man may
noi I think rather savors of a boycott."
Mr. Keller asked if Mr. Crocker would
issue a license to use the trademark to a
Chinese manufacturer in this State, to
which Mr. Crocker answered that he did
not think that he would.
"What, tnei., is ihe difference, so far as
the principle is concerned?" asked J. P.
Currier, "whether we issue our trade
mark to awhi.e man who employs Chi
nese or a Chiuebe wno employs only white
b ip?"
Tne question remained unanswered,
but still Mr. Crocker wanted the matter
postponed, and referred again to treading
upon "lancerous ground.
A. Sbarboro said that the public long
ago decided tbe Chinese question, and it is
not politic for the association to encourage
Chinese labor in any way.
Mr. Keller introduced the following
resolution, which, after a little discussion,
was adopted:
Resolved, That the committee on trademark
of this board be instructed to refuse the
issuance of a license to any manufacturers or
producers who do not employ exclusively free
white labor.
And so the matter was settled, and
when the Manufacturers' and Producers"
Association's trademark appears on any
goods or wares the public may rest as
sured that neither Chinese nor convict
hands had anything to do with their
manufacture.
ABGUAL ALL DAY.
Attorneys ill the Becker-Creegan For
gery Trinl Talk for Hour*.
The entire day was consumed in argu
ments in the Creegan-Becker forgery case
in Judcre Wallace's court yesterday. In
the morning Attorney McPike opened for
the defense and was followed by Mr. Wil
son, the special prosecutor. Wilson made
a point of the finding of the new $20
pieces in tbe trunks of the accused.
Peter J. Dunne closed for the defense.
His argument continued all the afternoon.
Dunne roasted the Police Department nnd
made all sorts of fun of Captain Lees. His
remarks aroused much laughter in the
crowd in the courtroom. Among other
allusions to the chief of detectives be
compared him to an old godmother who
carefully watches over the evil children â
Dean aud MrClosker. Again Dunne said:
"These two men remind me of two little

Dunne bitterly attacked the testimony of
both Dean and McClosker and accused
them of perjuring themselves on numer
ous occasions. His opinion of the prose
cution's witnesses is best expressed in the
following doggerel, which he delivered
during his remarks:
Please, captain, let McClosker go,
I'll swvar he Wttn't in the sliow.
Then he will swear, when he is free,
Thut he was mixed up in forgery.
I'll take the stana and swear the same,

The most important matter was the con
sideration of the tax levy for 1896-7. The
committee upon tmblic affairs to whom
this subject was referred at tne previous
meeting is composed of well-known busi
ness men and they gave much time and
attention to it. Their report was exhaus
tive, and by its contents it was shown
that tne affairs of the City can be carried
on in a creditable mnnner if the levy is 97
rents on the $100 instead of $L 56>^[, as it
was last fascal year, a matter of no small
importance to every one who holds prop
erty in San Fraucisco.
In order to prove the truth of their as
sertions the committeemen presented an
intimate of municipal expenditures for the
year, arranged by departments.
After discussing the report for several
hours the directors registered their in
dorsement and directed the secretary to
send, the report to the Board of Super-
Visors. The report is as follows:
ft the President, and Board of Directors of the
Merchant*' Associationâ Gentlemen: Your com
mittee upon public affairs herewith submits
iv special report upon the tax levy for the en
suinc tiscal year beginning July 1, 1896 and
ending June 30, 1597. A careful examination
of the appropriations for the City Government
during th^ past fiscal years, as well as the
present requirements of the municipality, has
resulted ia the preparation of the list of esti
mated appropriations herewith annexed. The
total of these appropriations for the ensuing
li'cal year amounts to $4,945,605. The Auditor
estimates the revenue oi the City outside of
taxation at $1,452,580. The Assessor has re
turned hifc assessed valuation o: all real and
personal property at S?3tio.32G,o3l.::Therefore
a tax rate of $1 on the $100 assessed valuation
wou d give the City a revenue from taxation
of $3,603,260. This amount, together with the
revenue from other sources, will give a total
income of $5,055,840. Consequently our esti
mated list of expenditures for 1896-97 would
leave a surplus of $110,235 on a tax rate of $1
on the $100 assessed valuation. In explana
tion of the appropriations set forth in the ac
companying list we beg leave to submit tne
following comments and conclusions:
Municipal expenses. â Municipal expenses
should be diviaed into two distinct ana sepa
rate heads. First, current expenses, compris
ing those expenditures necessary for the main
tenance and conduct oi the City Government;
second, extraordinary expenses, comprising
those expenditures necessary for permanent
improvements. Under the head of current ex
penses may be grouped salaries, supplies, re
pairs, renewals, utilities, suca as gas, water
and electricity; educational matters, police
and fire protection, public health, including
fetreet sweeping, and cases of urgency.
Current expensesâ The foregoing divisions
of current expenses embrace all matters per
taining to the operation and maintenance of
the City Government. The expenditures neces
sary for these current requirements of the City
should be paid out of tbe yearly income of the
City arising from general taxation and reve
nue from other sources. These current ex
penses of the cay Government, therefore, form
a correct part of the annual tax levy, and we
believe sufficient appropriations to meet them
have been made in the table of expenditures
herewith submitted.
Extraordinary expensesâ On the other hand,
extraordinary expenses are for necessary pub
lic improvements of a permanent nature,
such as a new end perfected sewer system,
general repaying of the streets, park improve
ments on a large scale, ownership ot water,
gas, and electric light; telephone, telegrapu,
â¢ railways and other public franchises.
Tnese valuable improvements and acquisi
tions require large outlays of money. They
arc naturally as much if not more beneficial
to posterity than to the present tr.xpayers of
the City. They should not, therefore," be lev
ied wholly upon the taxpayers of to-day.
These expenditures shonld be extended over a
number of years, so '.hat the future may just
ly bear a portion of the expense.
Bonding the Cityâ The constitution of Cal
fornia provides for such permanent improve
ments by enabling the city to issue bonds
covering a period of forty years. The new
charter oi Sau Francisco will furnish a cafe
method ana ttie necessary machinery for
mrrying out these great public improvements.
It will thus encourage the citizens and tax
payers of the City to vote for the early Issu
ance of bo: ds for these purposes.
â  stimaiesâ The estimates herewith sub
! nave been carefully and impartially cal
culated. It is believed they are liberal and fair
tttes of the limit ot expenditure* in each
department. No doubt in many instances lur
ther rejuctions could be made without im
pairing the public service. It will not be
necessary to take up each item separately, but
j our committee deems it advisable to explain

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
City and County for any Fish and ' Game
Warden, .. and, therefore, recommends the
omission ot any appropriation for that official.
Halving increased the appropriation for the
Health . Department, we believe that the ex
amination of insane persons should bo con-"
ducted under the supervision and at the ex
pense of the Board of Health. By the exercise
of reasonable economy, the expenditures for
stationery and printing can be reduced to
$18,000 for . the next fiscal year. The Audi
tor's estimate for $24,000 for the urgent neces
sity fund is recommended by your committee.
Tax rate.â During the past ten 'fiscal years,
the tax rate for City and County purposes has
never exceeded $1 07 on - the $100 assessed
valuation, except in 1887-88, when it was
nearly $1 15, and in the past fiscal year when
it exceeded the exorbitant rate of $1 56. It is
unfortunate, but true, that San Francisco has
not prospered during the past decade. In
1887 the population of the City was esti
mated at 830,000, while it is now estimated
at 350,000, showing the slight increase of only
20,000 inhabitants. The assessed valuation,
however, of all real and personal property in
the City has increased from $227,000,000 in
1885-86 to $360,000,000 in 1890-97, showing
an increase in valuation of fully $133,000,000.
This large increase of itself gives the City an
increased revenue of $1,330,000, at the rate of
$1 on the $100 assessed Valuation. This sum
should be more than ample to cover the in
creased expense attendant upon the expansion
of the City and the building up of its suburbs.
Your committee is, therefore, fully convinced
that a tax rate of $1 on the $100, with the
other sources of the City's income, will raise a
sufficient amount to conduct and maintain the
City government and will provide sufficient
funds to pay the expenses attendant upon the
election to be held in November of this year.
The surplus shown in the table herewith sub
mitted is sufficient to permit of a reduction of
more than $10,000,000 in the assessment roll
of this year. We confess, however, that many
of the reductions can only bo achieved with
the co-operation of the City officials. Under
the present defective system of our municipal
government the Legislature has provided more
offices and higher compensation than war
ranted by the needs of the City.
The new charterâ An examination Into the
financial affairs of the City government empha
sizes most strongly the necessity of a new
charter for the municipality. The present
method oi raising and spending the people's
money is so unsatisfactory and uncertain that
officials shirk their responsibilities and cannot
be held accountable for the proper disburse
ment of the public funds. One of the most
vicious methods of diverting public money is
provided in the general fund, into which is de
posited the revenue intended lor many of the
various departments. Expenditures are
drawn indiscriminately from this general
fund, without regard to the public welfare.
This fund will be abolished by the new char
ter and twenty-four specific funds will be pro
vided. Each fund will be kept separate 'and
distinct, and the I appropriation for each spe
cific purpose will be placed in its respective
fund, and cannot be used only for the exact
purpose for which it was appropriated. Very
respectfully submitted,
A. S. Baldwin,
J. 8. Cox well.

INJURED AT
A NEW CHURCH,
A Scaffolding Falls Thirty
Feet at the New St.
Brigid's.
THREE MEN BADLY HURT
Two More Laborers Leap on a
Wall in Time to Save
Themselves.
THERE WAS NO CONTRACTOR.
Rev. Father Cottle Explains How the
Accident Happenedâ Footlocks
Gave Way.
Just after the noon hour yesterday, when
the laborers on the new Bt. Brigid ; s
Church, at the corner of Van Ness avenue
and Broadway, weie returning to work, a
Scene of the Accident at the New Church of St. Brigid, Van Ness avenue and Broadway.
scaffolding at the west end of the building
gave way, carrying with it three men and
a quantity of bricks.
Two other men, Tim Doogan and Robert
Fulton, were near the edge of the scaffold
and felt it sway. They just escaped by
leaping back onto the wall, which is in
process of construction.
Tim Doogan was in tbe act of wheeling a
barrow loaded with bricks onto the scaf
fold. He was too far advanced to have
any power to pull back his barrow when
he felt the scaffold rock, and, therefore, let
go and made a leap for the wall, while the
barrow and its contents fell over thirty
feet, along with tbe scaffold. It is con
sidered that these bricks and those already
piled on tne scaffold inflicted most of the
injuries on the three men who fell.
There were twenty-four other laborers
employed on the building at the time.
They at once rusbed to the assistance of
the sufferers, while the pastor of St.
Brigid's, the Rev. John E. Cottle, and
his assistant priests, Rev. M. Bryan and
Rev. B. McKennon, who were at lunch in
the parish residence, hasten* a out with
restoratives. When the men were extri
cated from the pile of planks and bricks,
John Dougherty, the head carpenter, who
had been repairing the scaffolding at the
time it fell, was found to be conscious,
though evidently badly hurt. John
Gallagher, a brick-layer, and Patrick Mor
gan, a laborer, were both unconscious.
They were made as comfortable as possible
on cushions and rugs, from the parish resi
dence, until the patrol wagon and the
ambulace arrived.
At tbe Receiving Hospital it was found
that John Dougherty, who resides at 8 San
Carlos avenue, was the most seriously in
jured of tne three. He was suffering from
a broken shoulder-blade, three broken
ribs and internal injuries, which may
prove fatal.
Thomas Gallagher of Eddy place was
badly injured about tne head ana his right
leg was fractured.
Thomas Morgan, a laborer, was found to
have a fractured rib and an abrasion of
the arm and side. His wounds were not
so serious as those of the other men, and
after being treate-l at the hospital he was
able to return to nis home at 16 Foisom
avenue. Gallagher is an unmarried man,
but Dougherty and Morgan are both mar
ried.
The building where the accident occur
red is at the southwest corner of Van
isesÃ avenue and Broadway. The old
wooden church has been moved to the
south side, and in its place about half the
outer shell of a fine, gray-stone edifice has
been erected. Tbe new church was de
siened by a local firm of architects, but
father Cottle, the pastor, is his own
builder and contractor. He hires his men
by the day and during the five months
that have elapsed since work on the build
ing was commenced, he has devoted con
siderable time and labor to supervising
and directing the construction of his new
church.
Yesterday's accident was a great blow to
him. After doing everything in his power
for the injured men and making arrange
ments to receive news of them from the
Receiving Hospital, he returned to the
scene of the accident and quickly reached
a conclusion as to bow it happened.
The scaffolding which fell occupied part
of the semi-circle formed by the outer
wall of what will be the chancel. On the
outside the footlocks. or beams supporting
it. were built six inches ii.to the wall on
the inner edge of the s6mi-circle, the foot
locks being firmly attached to upright
beams driven into the ground.
"The footlocks gave way," said Father
Cottle, in describing the cause of the
disaster. "Instead of beine built eight or
ten inches into the wall, as in the case of
the scaffoldings in the other part of the
buiiaing, they only entered six inches
into this wall. Tbe men were about to
take away the run for wheeling bricks ud
to the scaffolding, and in order to have
plenty of bricks for going on with the
work, they were piling tbem on the
scaffolding. The jarrinsj of the barrows
must have loosened the footlocks and they
gave way."
When'questioned as to who was respon
sible for the security of the scaffolding.
Father Cottle replied that John Dough
erty, one of the injured men, was an ex
perienced carpenter, and had had entire
charge of all the scaffoldings in the build
ing.
"It was an accident for which r.o one
can be held responsible," added the pastor
of Bt. Brigia's. "Dougherty wan on the
scaffolding himself when it fell. The
loosening of the fool locks from the wall
was an acoident for which he cannot be In
anyway blamed." An examination of the
footlocks showed that, as Father Cottle
had divined, they were not broken but
had evidently jarred out of their sockets
in the wall, "it seems that a man named
Lcnnon, a stairbuilder, had assisted
Dougherty in the erection of the scaffolds,
but neither of them anticipated any dan
ger from tbe footlocks.

WOULD PAY WITH BLOWS
An Excitable Woman Created
a Scene in Justice
Cook's Conrt.
Angry MrÃ. Martha McElroy Wanted
to Thrash Collector Ed
ward Ackley.
A fight, with one of the belligerents a
member of the fair sex, waa averted in
Justice Cook's court yesterday only by the
interference of Bailiff Barney Conlan, who
held the angry womanâthe aggressor, by
the wayâ at arm's length until her in
tended victim could make his escape.
Edward Acitley, a collector, was suing-
Mrs. Martha McElroy, Â» handsome robust
woman, for $59 for medical services ren
dered by a local specialist. In order to se
cure hiÃ claim he had previously attached
her piano and furniture, much to tbe
anger of Mrs. McElroy, whose excitement
showed in her face the instant she saw the
collector.
Her excitement increased as the trial of
the case proceeded until when Ackley left
the stand after giving his testimony, she
could keep it in restraint no longer.
"You villain, you mean to rob me," she
shouted, and made a dash at the as
tonished Ackley, her hands eloquently ex
pressing her desire to pull his hair, scratch
his face or something equally violent.
"Order," howled the court in as com
manding tones as it could muster, but
Mrs. McElroy refused to "order," and was
fast getting witbin clawing distance
of the collector when Bailiff Con
lan took a band in the proceeding?, lay
ing firm but gentle hands on the irate
woman and preventing her from making
her intended attack on Ackley. She made
desperate efforts to get away, during
which the court roared alternate threats
of punishment and entreaties for peace
from a safe place on the bench.
Ackley finally made his escape, and
Justice Cook gave him judgment as he
sped down the corridor, Mrs. McElrov ad
mitting the debt, but objecting to the col
lector's method of collecting it.

MELODRAMAS
IN THE COURTS.
The Gamut of Emotion
Runs From Happiness
to Distress.
SAD CASES OF INSANITY.
All Sorts of Mental Wrecks as
Seen Before Judge
Slack.
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.
Action of a Man Who Did Not Agree
With His Sp: use's Religious
Views.
Not even in the theater, in these days of
startling modern melodrama, does tbe pre
sentation of mimic weal and woe change
from scenes of wealth and happiness or
i nnhappiness to terrible poverty and dis-
J tress more rapidly than in the law courts
|of to-day. Yesterday in Judge Slack's
court, immediately after tUe well-fed,
i fashionably attired crowd of attorneys and
; principals in the Fair will case, men and
! women engaged in a bitter legal battle for
i the possession of millions npon mil
lions of dollars, had filed out, the exam
i ination of insane persons was taken op.
"Most of the pitiable creatures were ill
| clad, dirty and ill-smelling. There were
j inebriates, idiots and other sorts of mental
I wrecks. The members of the motley crew
| were brought in, one at a time, to be ques
! tioned.
The first of the lot was a young Italian,
one of the sort that artists rave about; tail,
i well-formed, with handsome, clean-cat
features; a nose that any man might
envy; small, sharply twisted mustache,
and short, curling beard. He sat huddled
in his chair, with an old overcoat drawn
tightly around him, probably to conceal a
j paucity of other garments. Hia trousers
i barely reached his shoe tops and his long
hair was uncombed and matted. He be
lieves himself possessed of immense
wealth, and so refuses te work or even
care for his person. His wife had him ar
rested, and he was sent to the Stockton
asylum. His name is D. Bacigaiupi.
Next came a little old lady, scrupulously
neat and clean. She wore a well-fiuing
print dress of dark color, and a black
shawl covered her shoulders. A small
black bonnet was markedly in contrast
With her almost white hair. Ann Byrne
i is her name. She waa brought from the
; Aimshouse, and as she came in glanced
j nervously around as thoueh afraid the
! creatures that exist in her imagination
| were following her. She was Bent to
. Napa.
John Scully, an epileptic, whose palsied
i iesrs refused to support his heavy body
! dragged himself in, supported by two at
! tendants. His gross features and thick
i lips told the tale of indulgence that
| brought him to his present awhi! state
I He has been confined in the City Prison"
| charged with assault with a deadly
i weapon. In one of his paroxysms he tried
|to kill his sister with a razor. Ukiah is
bis future home.
Another phase of human passion was
I presented in the case of Mrs. R. W Smith
| She is a tall, determined-looking woman'
; with a long, sharp nose and defiant erav
eyes. TV ben called to the stand she smiled
and moved lorward with a jaunty air
'â May I take a drink of this water?" she
asked Judge Slack.
Having received permission the filled
and emptied a glass and then began her
story.
"'â¢.'"l Â»/ r res. esb yterian," said she, "ana
my husband is a Catholic. We live at
cortland avenue and Bennington street.
AYe have nad frequent quarrels on reli
gious subjects, and yesterday my husband
had me arrested on a charge of insanity."
The accused certainly showed no indica
tions of being mentally weak and was dis
charged. As sbe walked out of the court
room she paused to shake hands with each
J of a foimidable array of women who had
come to bear witness, if necessary, in her
be "i a am discharged," she said, gleefully,
to each of them.
NOTES OF THEATERS.
ii'ait Week of Kffle Shannon and Herbert
Kelcey. Blaxlme Elliott's "Lady
Gay Spanker."
The Stock'well Company's production of
"Americans Abroad" continues to fill the
theater. The performance is really a very
amusing one, though it is more uneven
than some of those which have preceded,
it. Stockwell, as the man who becomes
his own steward, manages to be extremely
funny without descending to farce, and
Miss'Effie Shannon as the little every-day
American girl, and Kelcey as the French
friend of the family are both good.
Next week "Carmen" will be produced.
At the Columbia Theater, Miss Maxine
Elliott is doing some of her best work as
Lady â¢ Gay Spanker in "London Assur
ance." Charles Wingate, who has taken
Frawley's place, is also good; indeed, the
all-round caste of the racy comedy is a
thoroughly satisfactory one.
It has been decided to put "The Charity
Ball" on for the whole of next week.
"A Money Order" gives the company at
the Grand opportunities for expressing in
tense heroism, virtue and vice, of which
they are not slow to take advantage.
Jules Walters has written a part for him
self, in which he fairly revels in excite
ment, and the other characters are also
based on those broadly marked lines
which always delight lovers of melodrama.
The play is drawing large houses.
The Jockley RoÂ«ton Troupe at the Or
pheum has not proved quite the attraction
that was anticipated, the man-monkey be
ing really inferior as an entertainer to the
genuine "monkeys that Professor Macart is
exhibiting at the Casino. The rest of the
Orpheum bill is excellent, Collins and
Collins having marie an especial bit.

HURRICANE GULCH
Sergeant Jack Hayes Makes
a Rich Find in
Sausalito.
HIS WIFE'S DISHPAN.
An Immense Rise Has Come in
Property Values Since
the Discovery.
A WATEE-FRCNT SYNDICATE.
Chief Wharfinger Root Has Joined
With the Policeman to Work
the New Claim.
It would take something more powerful
than an ordinary derrick to tear Sergeant
John Hayes from the idea that The Call,
in its eaeerness to publish the news, did
not do him an irreparable injury.
Hayes is a fctate employe at the head of
a little squad of po;icemen who look after
the interests of the Board of Habor Com
missioners. He lives over in Sausalito at
the head of Hurricane Gulch, named that
way on acoount of the wind that sweeps
down through it at all times, even when
the remainder of Sausalito is calm and
.'â¢weltering.
Hayes is very domesticated and seldom
spends any of his spare time away from
the hearth. Sundays he is always at
liume tinkering away at something or
other aud beautifying his already lovely
home.
Back of his residence, past a doghouse in
habited by a particularly ferocious canine,
which he very properly keeps tied up, is
the bed of a creek. It is dry at this season
to all intent and purpose, exespting in
spots where some of the rushing waters of
winter still remain in shallow pools.
Last Sunday the policeman and some of
his friends discussed mining and miners
topics quite familiar to Hayes, who was a
miner in days long past in the environs of
Pike's Peak. He told them of his expe
riences and recalled how the very land
they stood upon reminded him of grounds
he had worked and found to be good-pay
ing property.
It roquired little coaxing for him to take
Mrs. Hayes' dishpan and give his friends
an illustration of how mining was done in
river beds in early days. It was all very
interesting until the climax came. The
dirt was all washed out of the pan, and
there, in the residue were four little bright
yellow specks.
Gold! There was no questioning the
fact. It was certainly the precious metal
that peeped out from among the peebles.
Marshall, when he discovered gold in
the Gutter mill-race in 1848, was less
astonished than Sergeant Hayes.
He ceased work, and the next day lie
was over on this side of the bay, where he
confided the secret of his find to Chief
Wharfinger George W. Root.
Both these gentlemen took a run over to
Sausalito and panned out more dirt.
There was plenty of black sand, almost an
infallible indication of good pay dirt, and
some fine gold flakes were gathered in.
But most of the gold was found on an
adj lining piece of property to the one
owned by Hayes, and belonging to a man
named Miller. So it was decided that be
fore the news of the gold tind was made
known that particular piece of property
must be bought up.
The property in triangular in shape and
the major part of it is on a 45-degree fall
to the creek and is valueless. Still, Miller
was willing to sell the whole thing for
$250, so Hayes says.
The day set for the purchase was yester
day, when au ill-advised newspaper was
inconsiderate enough to publish the fact
tnat there had been gold" discovered in
Hurricane Gulch, back of the Hayes cot
tage.
That settled the deal. Miller read The
Call yesterday morning, and when Hayes
and his partners, Messrs. Root, Gilfett
and Bloomer, who were all interested in
the venture, ran Miller down and offered
him the $250, that gentleman smiled and
asked for a week's time in which to think
over the matter.
"He'll want all prices for it nowl" ex
claimed Hayes, when seen yesterday aft
ernoon by a Call reporter.
"That article should never have been
published uniil I got hold of the property,
a;id I'd show you how gold is panned out."
Years ago tbere was considerable min
ing done north of Hurricane Gulch, but it
never paid sufficiently to warrant ex
tensive working. There were too many
paying river-bed claims to lose time in the
guich, so it is comparatively a virgin field.
That there is some coM there cannot be
doubted, but it is not likely that Sergeant
Hayes will give up his lucrative $150 posi
tion on the City front to become an out
and-out miner.
A BANKRUPT SALE.
11m I* a Genuine One and Patron* of
"The Maze" TVIII Be the Oneg
Benefited.
So-called bankrupt sales are of frequent
occurrence and are not always genuine,
but in case of the sale now going on at the
store of the Hamburger Company, well
known as 'Toe Maze," the fact that it is a
bankrupt sale cannot be questioned. The
house has with their customary enterprise
taken advantage of a rare opportunity to
buy the stock of a bankrupt "merchant of
Los Angeles at a big discount. This mer
chant, E. Weinbur gb, carried an exten-
Bive stock of fine goods, but a combination
of circumstances forced him to the wall
and the best bid offered for his stock was
that of the Hamburger Company. They
offered the Board of Trade of Los Angeles,
who had charge of the matter, biy^ cents
on the dollar of the cost price and tins bid
was accepted.
The goods were shipped here at once
and the sale began last Monday, and it is
no exaggeration to say that on that day
The Maze never entertained such a crowd
since they commenced business. They
were obliged to put on e.^.tra clerks and in
crease their delivery facilities. Since that
day many new goods have arrived, includ
ing: Shirtwaists, laces, mens' neckwear,
dress goods, wash goods, etc., and the
crowds still continue to flock to the store.
In order to conform to the prices that
are ruling at this sale, The Hamburger
Company has reduced prices in many
regular lines. This is particularly true in
the cloak department, and now cloaks,
jackets and suits are being sold at bieger
discounts than have ever been known in
the history of this City. The ladies of San
Francisco are quick to appreciate genuine
'jarg&ins, as the attendance at this sale at
tests.

HORRIBLE DISCOVERIES.
A Cellar in Which the Main
Sewer Found a Ready
Outlet.
BUILDINGS TO BE CONDEMNED.
The Board Will Recommend the De
molition of Several Unsanitary
Structures.
A delegation of the Board of Health !
went looking for foul stenches and iniqui- j
tons plumbing in Chinatown yesterday |
afternoon.
Chinatown is prolific in stenches that
cry unto heaven, and the plumbing,
I though not extensive, is decidedly defect- |
I ive. Yet the Board of Health yesterday
did not see a tenth of the reeking tilth that
ordinarily attends the nostrils o f the ad
venturous sightseer who wanders into the
crowded little alleys that serve as high
ways and sewers for the rickety tenement
! houses that line them. Perhaps it was
coincident, but everywhere was seen the
marks of the broom.
Fish alley, whose remarkably pungent
odors have been a matter of history in the i
City for years, was in a state of compara- j
tive cleanlineÃÃ. It would have put to
shame the wholesale districts in the vi
cinity of Battery and Clay streets. The
disgusting offal that ordinarily obstructs
the gutters was nowhere in evidence, and
instead limpid streams of purifying water
found their way by the natural inlets to
the sewer. Chinatown had reformed.
The investigating party started out at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Officer J.
H. Butterworth, who was several months
ago on special duty as Plumbing Inspector
of Chinatown, acted as guide, and Drs.
Morse, Williamson and Hart of the board,
Edwin Gottschaux, pecretary; Dr. Love
lace, Health Officer: Dr. Lazaer of John
Hopkins University, department of sani
tation, and some newspaper men were of
the party. At Chinatown the party was
joined by Inspector Fay, who is at present
looking out for Chinatown's sanitary con
dition.
The investigators proceeded through the
narrow alleys, remarking as they went on
the great improvement since last year.
At Onsida place, a pocket off Sacramento
street, between Dupont and Stockton, a
Visit was made to some of the habitations
of the lowly Chinese. In one of these, oc
cum'ed by a ragpicker, the atmosphere was
| so vile that a few seconds 'stay in it made
the eyes burn and the head swim.
A small oil lamp burning before an
ancestral tablet, which is a necessity to
even the poorest of this race, gave forth a
fetid and sickening odor. Yet even here
there was nothing that could readiiy be
criticized by the board, so they passed
it by.
As the party proceeded the Chinese
gathered in wondering groups and chat
i tered excitedly. Through open doorways
I could occasionally be caught glimpses of
j the ratlike faces of white "dope" fiends.
These did not exhibit the same interest, as
the Chinese life holds but one thing of in
terest for opium's slave.
Between Ross and Chnrch alleys is a
reeking underground passaee which the
board last year ordered closed. When it
was reached on yesterday's tour it was
open, but a white man was industriously
playing a hose upon it while half a dozen
Chinamen plyed brooms vigorously.
"Who ordered this alley opened ?" was
asked the white man.
He replied It was under the orders of
L. C. Babbin. Inspector Fay was in
tructed to investigate and if he found that
Babbin was countermanding the board's
orders, to proceed against him. Church
alley was in a generally objectionable con
dition and the inspector was instructed to
have it closed.
The next objectionable feature en
countered was on Duneomb alley. Here
a rough shed, barely tall enoughjw'ithin for
a man to stand erect, is occupied by a
startling number of emaciated human
beings. The board decided there was
but one thing to be done with the shed
and at the next meeting they will recom
mend its complete destruction.
The most Horrible case disclosed was in
a cellar at 705 Pacific street kept by Hong
Kee as a second-hand store. Hong Kee's I
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
sien announces in English that he is
ready to buy and sell second-hand goods
of ail kinds and the assortment he has
collected suggests that he has succeeded
in sretting a little of everything useless.
When Officer Butterworth stepped into
the cellar he recoiled as if he had been hit.
The pla^e was a veritable mine of sewer
gas, yet calmly sorting rags in the dim
blue light of a flickering caudle sat the ob
livious proprietor. Taking a deep breath
of fresh* air and plucking up his courage.
Officer Butterworth entered upon an ex
ploring tour. His shouts soon brought
one or two other members of the party to
his side, and there he showed the cause of
the poisonous air. Beneath the sidewalk
the earth had caved away until a direct
passageway was opened to the main
sewer.
This will be remedied immediately,
though just how it will be done was left to
Inspector Fay's discretion.
Dupont street was next visited. The
rotten walls of a row of buildings extend
ing from Baker alley to the Globe Hotel,
between Pacific and Washington streets,
attracted the party's attention. At the
corner of Baker alley the upper story of
the building is used as a "sweat" shop.
Here a number of Chinese were engaged
in making overalls, while in an adjoining
room were two or three women and one
or two children, and evidence that the en
tire working force also resided there.
The ceilings were low and the floors and
wall threatened to come down at any
moment. Entrance to the place was
gained by climbing a ladder, a knotted
ropÂ« supplying the place of a bannister.
The entire block was found to be in a sim
ilar condition and it was the sense of the
members of the board that all the build
ings between the Globe Hotel and Baker
alley should be condemned.
Fish alley was visited, but nothing ob
jectionable was found in the street itself.
In the rear of one of the fish stores a num
ber of barrels of salt fish giving forth a
frightful stench were discovered, a not
very difficult task, and the inspector was
instructed to have the nuisance abated.
As a whole the board was very favora
bly impressed with the improvements in
the sanitary condition of the quarter,
though most of them are of the opinion
that nothing but a conflagration could
ever exterminate all Chinatown's objec
tionable features. On their visit last year
they made several recommendations,
most of which have been carried out, but
the Chinese have fre<ju"ntiy rendered the
innovations inoperative. * Where pipes
were ordered in for flushing sink hoppers,
they have taken off the faucets and capped
the pipes. They have taken traps out of
sinks because they impeded the flow of
water, and have generally showed a most
hearty contempt for things sanitary.
It is the Augean stable and the Board of
Health modestly doubts that is the Hercu
les who is to cleanse it, but they will try.
MISSING MANY MONTHS,
Mysterious Disappearance of
Curtis Gibson of North
Bangor, N. Y.
He Wrote to His Wife From This City
on January i, but Has Not Been
Heard of Since.
The police were notified yesterday of the
mysterious disappearance of an elderly
eentlernan, Curtis Gibson of North Ban
jror, Franklin County, N. V., by Mrs. Maud
Lord Drake of 325 Geary street.
He belongs to North Bangor, bat lived
for three or four years in Los Angeles
where he purchased some property for
about $14,000. Toward the end of last
year he was married to a lady friend of
Mrs. Drake, and two weeks after the mar
riage he left North Bangor for Los Angeles
to dispose of his property there. He did
so, and wrote his wife to that effect and
that he would bring the money home with
him.
He came to this City on bis way home
and wrote his wife on January 1 that he
was to leave by that evening's train. He
did not return' home, and since then his
wife has heard nothing about him.
''I did not know of my friend's marriage
to Mr. Gibson," said Mrs. Drake, "till I
received a letter from her yesterday in
which she told me of his disappearance
and asked me to make inquiries about
him.
"Mr. Gibson was about 65 years of age, I
should think, and his wife was some years
younger, but she is an exceedingly bright
lady and bears her years well. They
had known each other from childhood.
He is a man of wealth and they have a
beautiful home in North Bangor. He
wanted to dispose of his property in Los
Angeles and return home ao that he and
his wile could spend the remainder of
their life together iv ttWr native city.
"His disappearance is unaccountable
and I am afraid something serious has
happened him. He must have had about
$14,000 with him and probably he has Been
robbed and murdered. His wife men
tioned that she thought he had written
from the Russ House/
Inquiry was made at the Russ House,
but no such name as Curtis Gibson was
registered there.

TO TEST PRECINCT
REGISTRATION.
Attorney Francoeur Will
Take the Question to
The Courts.
ANOTHER LEGAL MUDDLE
The Usual Douht as to How Far
a General Law Affects
This City.
REGISTRATION IS STILL SLOW.
Little Time Is Left, and There Is Dan
ger That Thousands Will B9
Disfranchised.
The mooted question of whether or not
the precinct re.istration decided upon by
Registrar Hinton will actually occur, and
whether or not it wouid be legal, is to be
soon settled by taking a test case to the
Supreme Court.
Attorney George H. Francoeur, chair
man of the Iroquois Club committee
appointed to consider the matter, will
within a day or two apply to
the Supreme Court for an injunc
tion or a writ of mandamus, taking
the step with the consent and assistance
of the Registrar and the Election Commis
sioners. The Iroquois Club, the Registrar
and the Election Board are all anxious to
carry out precinct registration, but the le
gality of precinct registration this year is
a question they deem highly important
to settle in advance, as there would De a
possibility that haif the names on the
register might be stricken therefrom or
the election invalidated.
The whole matter of registration is in a
doubtful and dangerous condition. There
is in this City a legal tangle involved that
no lawyer has yet been willing to express
definite opinions upon.
Then, as has been urged before, the set
ting ahead of the period of registration
and making it close three months before
election presents the great danger that
many thousands of voters will neglect to
register in tima and be disfranchised.
As the new registration law which di
rects registration to begin 160 days before
election and continue for 75 days is a
general one, this danger confronts the en
tire State. Nowhere in the State may a
voter register after August 8. The un
usual necessity for general and prompt
urging of voters everywhere to attend to
registration is a matter which all the
State Central committees are considering.
The Populist State Central Committee has
decided to isÂ«ue warnings to all of its
county central committees in the fear that
its party may especially suffer.
Registration in this City has always
heretofore been carried on under a special
law which provided for precinct registra
tion. The last Legislature passed a new
general registration law, and it is the
doubt as to what extent and in what ways
this general law repeals the special law
applicable to San. Francisco which occa
sions the trouble about precinct registra
tion. Registrar Hinton has ordered regis
tration in accordance with the general
law, but has assumed that the tangle sttil
allows precinct registration, though he
has ordered it for an earlier time than
twenty days before election, as specified in
the law. City and County Attorney Cres
well yesterday stated the situationbriefly
as follows:
The amendments to the Political Code passed
in 1395 show thai it was the intention ot the
Legislature to have the elections In San Fran
cisco governed by the general law. This is
evident from the omission of the following
clauses in the original sectionâ lo94â viz.:
"N. <tliing in this section shall beheld to repeal
any election or registration law applicable to
or in force in the City and County of Sau Fran
cisco."
The special law required registration to be
gin ninety day* before the election and con
tinue seventy-five days.
The general law requires the registration to
begin 160 days b.fore the election and to con
tinue seventy-live days and tlitn cease.
Both of these laws cannot be put in force,
for the obvious reason that you cannot at One
and the same time commence registration 160
days and ninety days before the election;
hence the general law must prevail.
Tin- general law is silent about precinct reg
istration. The - special law requires preciuct
registration to begin twenty days before the
election and to continue till fifteen days before
the election.
It Is manifest that the requirement of the
general law that the registration shall cease
eighty-live days before the election cannot be
observed if you continue the registration
under the requirement of the special law till
fifteen days before the election.
If the Supreme Court should hold that the
requirement Of the special law that the pre
cinct registration should begin . twenty days
before the election ana continue till fifteen
days before the election is an awkward way of
saying that the last five days of the registra
tion period should be given over to precinct
registration, and (hat it means that and noth
ing more, then the general law, being silent
on precinct registration, ' the special law can
be observed in that particular by devoting the
last rive days of the seventy-live under the
general law for that purpose.
But if the court snould hold that the special
law requiring precinct registration to cease
fifteen days before the election, is a direction
as to time, then It cannot be observed, be
cause the general law requires registration . to
cease eighty-five days before the election.
Hence it win be seen that this is a most serious
question.
"I have no doubt in my own mind about
the legality of the precinct registration I
have ordered," said Registrar Hinton yes
terday, "but still I admit that there may
be a legal question, and it is well io have
it settled. There is danger that the courts
may decide that there is no precinct, regis
tration, and that many voters will be left
in the lurch. The question is, How does
the general law affect the special law? Is
Sau Francisco governed by the special or
by the general act, or by the special act as
modified by the puneral one? I regard the
general law as modifying and not repeal
ing the special law."
Mr. Hinton thinks that the law will be
liberally construed in the interest of the
voter whose registration it is the purpose
of the law to facilitate as well as to pro
tect, and he points to the following ex
tract from a Supreme Court decision in a
case from Fresno :
Object of registration law, construction in
favor of voters. The object of the registration
law is to prevent illegal voting by providing,
in advance of flection, an authentic list of
qualified electors, and when its terms are
doubtful they should be so construed as to
give the fullest opportunity to voters to pro
cure the entry of their names upon the register
that is consistent with reasonable precautions
against fraudulent registration.
Mr. Francouer and Mr. Creswell held a
conference yesterday, but it was not de
cided just what technicality would be
seized upon for a teat case. However, the
question will be brought before the Su
preme Court within a day or two and aa
early decision sought.
Registration is increasing at the central
oftice, but it is yet several hundred behind
the daily average necessary to be made to
register the usual number of voters within
the comparatively few days remaining.
The registration yesterday was 974, mak
ine the total registration 12,266.
Two years ago the total registration was
about 69.000. In the year in which a
Presidential election is held the registra
tion is generally 10 per cent heavier, so
that 75,000 names should be registered in
this City this year. There are but twenty

seven days of registration left, making an

In past years about 30,000 voters have

The danger is especially great from the
fact that citizens are used to waiting until
shortly before election and from the fur
ther tact that there is not just now the in
centive and the prompting to looking
after registration that a voter feels amid
the full excitement of a campaign.
Registrar Hinton decided yesterday to
keep his office open for registration on
Saturday evening from 7 to 9 o'clock, and
it is likely that later the office will be open
every evening.
BOMBARDING A HOUSE.
Two Boys Improviop Minlatur* Cannons
and Play Havoc on the
Fourth.
Two 16-year-old boys amused themselves
on Independence day by bombarding a
house on Folsom street, between Thir
teenth and Fourteenth, until they had it
look as if it had been struck by a cyclone.
The posts of the fence and almost the
entire fence were knocked into kindling
wood, and almost the entire front of the
building was demolished.
The house is a two-story frame one, and
is owned by P. Murphy. It is occupied
by te nants, who were in the building at
the time of the bombardment, and nar
rowly escaped being struck by the
missiles.
Murphy complained to the police, and
Captain Gillen detailed Policeman Neil
Reardon on the case. After diligent in
quiry Keardon ascertained that the two
boys were Eugene Vandever, employed in
a blacksmith-shop on Harrison street,
and Norman Porter, employed in a fur
niture iactory. Murphy swore out war
rants for their arrest Wednesday, and
Reardon arrested them that evening.
They took a shotgun and sawed off the
barrel, leaving about fifteen inches of it.
Then they bound it to a thick piece of
wood, making a sort of miniature cannon.
They loaded it with powder and iron
spikes, such as are used" in railroad work,
and fired them at the house. They had
another instrument made out -of the top
of an ax.
They cut the ax and rounded it off up to
where it commences to bevel. Then they
bored a hole through to about the center
and another hole from the top to join the
other. They also bound this to a piece of
wood, loaded it with powder and spikes
and bombarded the house with it. The
two miniature cannons were captured by
Po-'iceman Reardon.
After they were arrested on the charge
of malicious mischief Vandever confessed
and explained the modus operandi. They
were released on their own recognizance
by Judee Campbell.
Wanderer and Porter were convicted be
fore Judge Campbell yesterday and were
ordered into custody to appear for sen
tence this morning.
NEVADA BANK OBJECTS.
Want* Its AMPimni'iit Decreased Nearly
a Million and a Half.
The Nevada Bank addressed the County
Board of Equalization yesterday on the
subject of Assessor Siebe's valuation of its
possessions, characterizing the result of his
calculations as "unjust, excessive and
illegal."
The communication states that of the
$2,302,000 for which the bank is assessed
$1,474,157 should be deducted, Decause it is
not property within the State of California,
but is entirely out of the State, as it be
longs to branch institutions and should
be assessed to them in the States or coun
ties where they are located, and the board
is asked to adjust the matter.

THE COMING CARNIVAL.
Citizens Express an Enthusiastic
Sentiment in Favor
of It.
W. H. Mills Says It Will Result in
Great Benefit to Commercial
Interests.
A citizens' gathering in the interest of
the Carnival of the Golden Gate was held
yesterday afternoon in the Chamber of
Commerce. Hugh Craig was chosen
chairman and S. W. Backus secretary.
"We are here," said the chairman, "to
devise ways and means for the successful
carrying out of the coming carnival or
festival. To do this we must have the
press with us and not depend too much
upon a canvass from door to door as a
source of revenue."
After Assistant Secretary Fisher had
read the proposed programme for carnival
week Colonel John O'Byrne of the execu
tive committee said that he heartily fa
vored ti:e holding of the contemplated
carnival and realized that behind it were
important consequences. To insure its
success the aid of the great corporations
would be essential, and he accordingly
moved the appointment of a committee to
confer with the moneyed men and cor
porations.
The chair named as such committee
Messrs. H. J. Crocker, W. G. Harrison,
W. H. Mills, J. D. Phelan, George New
hall, Adolph Spreckels, D. Rich, F. A. Ha
ber, George Stone and General W. H. War
field, who will meet soon in consultation
with the finance committee.
H. J. Crocker announced that at 1:30 p.
m. next Tuesday, on the floor of the Mer
chants' Exchange, S. L. Jones would hold
an auction sale of the boxes and loges in |
the Columbia Theater. The performance,
which is to be for the benefit of the carni- i
â¼al, will take place at the following
Thursday matinee, when the Frawley
company will give "London Assurance."
A vote of thanks was tendered to the
managers of the Columbia upon the mo
tion of Mr. Crocker, who said that their
example would be followed by all of the
other principal places of amusement.
A letter was read from W. H. Mills in
which it was stated that the money ex
pended upon the carnival should be looked
upon not as a donation by subscribers,
but as an investment. It was desired in
this way to introduce into the art life of
San Francisco a permanent and profitable
feature. Much money was lost to the
City every year because the residents were
compelled to go elsewhere in search of
amusement.
F. A. Haber added that all of the re
tail merchants were enthusiastically in
favor of the carnival, which would
materially benefit commercial interests
and bring about more intimate relations
between the metropolis and the surround
ing cities aud towns.
THE CITY'S TITLE.
City and County Attorney Creswell's
Opinion on the Ownership of
Ocean Avenue.
City and County Attorney Creswell was
asked some tima aco to pass upon the
question as to whether the City has any
title to Ocean avenue, formerly called the
Ocean House road, portions of which are
claimed by Behrend Joost and others, and
to determine the width of the avenue.
His reply was sent in yesterday as follows:

HATS TRIMMED FOR. 50c j
i the City and County of San Francisco: On De
cember 18, 1895, 1 received from your honora
i ble body a resolution, of which the following
i is a copy, viz:
"Resolution No. 13421 (third series). Re
solved, That the City and County Attoruey be
and is hereby requestea to examine and re
port to this board as to whether the City and
County has an? right or title to Ocean avenue
(formerly called Ocean House road) and if the
title is vested in the City and County then to
report the width of paid avenue."
Ocean avenue Is found on the Humphrey
map of 1870 of the City and County first, and
is there named Ocean-House road. The east
ern terminus of the road is at the intersec
tion of Bauer street with the County road, and
it runs thence in an irregular course west and
northwest about two miles to its western ter
minus at the place of its intersection with the
old San Miguel toll road, near to what is now
known as lugleside.
I have had a search made of the records of
the office of the City and County Surveyor and
the Recorder's office, and have failed to find
anything of record touching the width of
Ocean-House road.
I have found two maps on file in the office of
the Surveyor, mftde by County Surveyor Gard
ner in 1854, A. D., showing the route as it
then existed of Ocean-House road. Neither of
these maps ihow the width of the mad.
1 have found In the Recorder's office a map
made in 1854, A. D., showing what purports
to be a dedication of ground for the purpose of
I widening Ocean-House road from Arlington
I avenue to Stagg'B Hotel.
This map is signed as follows: "Approved
May 13, 1895; Adolph Sutro. Approved for
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club, M. M. O'Shaueh
nessy, engineer, May 9, 1895; M. M. O'Shaugh
nessy."
From the foregoing I conclude that as long
ago fig 1854 A. D. there was a road known as
the Ocean House rOHd ; that it in not now in
exactly the same situation it was then, but it
| is substantially so; and that it was used as a
| public highway. The conveyances of land
I abutting the road will probably show the
| width of it. It would be necessary to have an
: abstract ox title made in order to obtain thit
i information.
Inasmuch as your resolution does not recite
that the roadway has been infringed upon by
any one I assume that none of the property
rights of the City and County are imperiled",
and that your Inquiry was madent the request
of some one specially interested. If such is
the case the specially interested party should
furnish this office with a complete abstract of
the sales of property contiguous to the road
tor the two miles of its length, in order that a
lull answer may be made to your resolution.
It would require the undivided attention of
one of the deputies in this office several months
I to make such an abstract.
I Immediately upon receipt of your resolution
I I investigated this matter sufficiently to see
I that no rights of the City aud County were in
jeopardy, and thereupon made this communi
cation give way to more important matters in
my office requiring attention.
July 9, 1896. Harry T. Crkswkix.
City Attorney and Counselor.
TIRED OF THE BOULEVARD
van Ness and Golden Gate Avenue
Property-Owners Want a Change.
A portion of the residents of two
thoroughfares that were recently declared
boulevards by the Board of Supervisors
have discovered that such a proceeding
was not without its disadvantages to them.
Property-owners on Van Ness avenue
from Turk street to Market and on Golden
Gate avenue between Market street and
Van Ness avenue have petitioned the
Board of Supervisors, stating that between
the points mentioned the two streets are
given over to business, and that the boule
vard proposition has made them deterio
rate in value. They asked that the por
tions described be exempt from the action
of the boulevart or-linanee.
The Street Committee of the board de
cided yesterday to recommend that the pe
tition of the Golden Gate avenue people
be granted and that the Van Ness avenue
matter be laid over for two weeks.

When she was a Chad, she cried for Castoria,
When she became Miss, she clung to Castoria.
When she had Children, she gave them Castoria.

THE EXEMPTS CHEER " OLD GLORY."
Commemoration Ceremonies
Ye&terday on the
Plaza.
TALKED PIONEER LORE
The Old Engine Gayly Decorated
in Honor of the Oc
casion.
COMMODORE SLOAT EULOGIZED-
In the Afternoon the Old Firemen
Gave Their Friends a Hearty
Reception.
The Exempt Firemen held an enthusi
astic celebration yesterday in commemo
ration of the fiftietn anniversary of the
raising of "Old Glory" in this City. On
the same spot in the old plaza and at
approximately the same time of day the
ceremony of floating the stars and stripes
to the breeze was repeated yesterday to
the delight of the firemen, Mexican War
Veterans and Pioneers.
Most of tbe gradually diminishing num
ber of representatives of pioneer days wit
nessed yesterday's ceremonies. The sur
viving 100 members of the Exempt Com
pany, which once numbered over 1000
members, turned out in their old brown
uniforms, admiringly exhibited the old
engine to visiting friends and talked over
the days of old.
Shortly before noon the detachment of
sailors and marines from the Philadelphia
assembled with its band on the plaza, and
two Hotchkiss guns, one on either side of
tbe flagpole, were placed in position.
About five minutes to 12 the proces
sion was formed, headed by the Exempts
under the leadership of President George
T. Bohen. Following came tne invited
guests composed of City officials and promi
nent citizens, and also the Veterans of the
Mexican War, led by Major Sherman.
The Exempts, proudly wearing their old
brown uniforms, formed a circle about the
company's flagstaff, while the others
formed in a double line toward the south.
The sailors from the Philadelphia, some
200 strong, presented a pretty sight in j
their white uniforms, set off by blue sailor
collars and brown leggings. They con
trasted with the bright red uniforms ot the
Philadelphia's band.
Half a minute beiore the noon hoar the
order was given to at attention. One
of the crew of the Philadelphia stood by
the flagstaff with his nand upon the rope
that shouid loosen the little bundle at the
top of tbe pole. At the first tap of the
bi;j bell on Brennam place, the signal
was given to unfurl. As tbe sailor at the
tope pulled away the flag fluttered forth !
beautifully. Gradually it opened out in i
tue almost imperceptible breeze, almost as j
a lady's fan would open, until it floated
fortn at fuil length. As the flag unfurled
the band struck up the "Slar Spangled
Banner," and all the assembly saluted the
flag with uncovered heads, the Exempts
saluting in true military fashion. Then
the guns began to blaze away alternately,
until the National salute of twenty-one
guns had been completed. Three cueers
and a tiger, given by the Exempts with
old-time Vim, concluded the exercises in j
the plaza.
A general reunion followed during the
short interim between the ceremonies and
tte speeches. Gray-naired old firemen
Hailed each other familiarly as "Jack" or
"Bill" and fondly talked of the old days |
RABBI VOORSANGER. WHO DELIVERED THE ORATION.
en they ran with the machine. "Tom,"
said one of the old boys to another, "do
you suppose we will be here at the next
celeoration, fifty years from now?" "lam '
afraid we won't," answered Tom slowly,
with a regretful shake of his head. 'Tve
caught you this time," laughed the old
fire-lighter, as he chuckled in his glee. "Of
course we'll be here; we'll be floating up
there on our winus taking it all in. The
joke's on you this time, old feilow. You
thought you were goinj: down below,
where you couldn't see the old machine
decorated up on the centennial celebra
tion," and he chuckled still louder as he
poked Tom's ribs.
The old engine, which the white-haired
arid erizzled Exempts pointed out with
Pride yesterday to every visitor at Bren
ham place, had been gayly decorated with
streamers and pampas plumes of the Na
tional colors, and above it a large Japan
ese umbrella formed a canopy over the
"old machine."
A platform was improvised alongside of
the engine, and here sat President Bohen
of the Exempts ani the speakers. J. B.
Whittemore Jr., a grandson of Commo
dore Sloat, read in clear, firm tones the
proclamation which his grandfather had
read fifty years before.
After tbe readme of Commodore Sloat's
proclamation, Rabbi Voors.inger, who is
an honorary member of the Exempt Fire
Company, delivered the address of the
day.
"We are making history to-day," bepan
the speaker, "when we commemorate, al
most to the minute, the niising of the
flag which signaled the American acquisi
tion of what had been Mez'Ctin territory.
It is fitting for as to salute that flag which
has just been unfurled â the Sag that has
represented the honor of the American
Republic such as no individual has ever
represented it. We salute that flag be
cause it has waved above men who, with
out a thought of their personal advantage,
considered only the honor of their coun
try and were willing to sacrifice their lives
and fortunes for the glory of their native
land.
"In saluting the nag we honor also the
memory of the men who, fifty years ago
in this very square, at the hour of high
noon, proclaimed the same message that
was proclaimed long before in the old
State House at Philadelphia. We do
honor to the memory of those by whom
Mexican soil was made no longer Mexican,
but consecrated to liberty and freedom.
"Fifty years have gone by since the
great proclamation, sent from the ship in
Monterey Bay, was read here on this spot.
Fifty years have passed since American
settlers began to come here and to take up
their abodes in this, God's :own land. In
these fifty years Old Glory has done nobly
and bravely, but in the coming fifty years
it will do sti^l greater thines. We do not
now wish to speak of the disadvantages of
other Governments, but of the advan
tages of the people who came here fifty
years ago and of the legacy which they
have left us.
"Although we are a million strong in
California, few of us fully realize the
beauty and glory of tbe inheritance which
has oeen left us. We do not sufficiently
appreciate the grandeur of our moun
tains, keeping watch over the valleys on
which, it has always seemed to me, God
has poured out all the blessings he had
left alter the sixth day of creation. Not a
single blessing is lacking, ot land, of
water or of sky, in the glorious endow
ment which nature has made upon Cali
fornia.
"Native sons and native daughters
should be more grateful than any others
for the glonoua patrimony which Sioat
and his brave men have left them. I hone
they are grateful, but sometimes I fear
they do not feel sufficient gratitude. Is it
enough for us to stand in the presence of
those gathered here to unfurl this flag and
to say that Sloat was a good fellow? You
all have duties to perform â the duty of
securing to yourself the gift of freedom so
grandly won for you.
"Instead of running to listen to every
heresy, instead of being swayed by every
appeal to y^ur passions, there should be
one sentiment that snould bind you to
gether â the sentiment that this country,
no matter how much divided by parties,
is greater than the State, and that the
State is greater than any party. We
should also realize that, no matter how
seriously this country may be divided on
questions of church and state, there should
be guaranteed freedom of religious belief
to every man so long as he is loyal to this
country.
"We are on the eve of a great contest
between parties. It matters little which
shall triumph, so long as the honor of the
constitution is upheld and the people re
main loyal to the flag, so long as under
Gou's heaven there shall be but one thing
to be protected with honor â the honored
folds of Old Glory."
At the conclusion of the outdoor cere
monies the Exempts and their invited
guests adjourned to the upper hall of the
company's en^me-.iouse, where an infor
mal reception was held. The hall had
been beautifully and significantly deco
rated for the occasion. Draped with the
National colors numerous pictures of vet
eran firemen were about tne walls. About
each oi these pictures groups of hoary
headed firemen were gathered all after
noon, and many were tbe thrilling remi
niscences of daring deeds of long ago tnat
the representations of features of leaders
long since departed called forth.
The president's desk was ornamented
with huge bouquets 'and between these
were the trumpets through which the
old officers were wont to direct their men.
These trumpets were also fraught with
pleasant memories; in fact it was a day of
memories and the old boys who ran with
the machine when the century was in its
prime grew young again as they viewed
the emblems of former struggles with the
devouring element.
Prominent among the decorations was a
bust of Lilly Hitchcock, the first and only
honorary member of the Fire Department.
It was her distinguished honor to be a
member of tbe Knickerbocker Company,
No. 5. That was a long time ajÂ»o, but sne
yet lives at Larkspur, Marin County, to
tell of her popularity with the tire laddies.
There were o; her things not so ornamen
tal, but none the less cheerful, in the nail.
At each end was a hospitable-looking
table ladened with cood things to eat and
drink, especially to drink, and the open
handpd Exempts dispensed of their uood
cheer HWally to their guests, not forget
ting the demands of their own inner men.
There was speochraaking, too, and
songs that were lou-i and lively. The
speeches were not set affairs, but they had
the true ring, and the patriotic utterances
with which they abounded and the com
plimentary references to the old firemen
brought forth applause that would have
warmed the cockles of any orator's heart.
Major K. A. Sherman" was the first
speaker called upon. After recounting
the history of the acquisition of California
by the United States, he said: "When
Commodore Bloat raised the American
nag down went church and state, and
every roan, be be what he is or who he is
can worship as he pieases. We don't care
what a man believes. He can go to
heaven or hell as he pleases and in bis
own way.
'â¢I want to say a word in favor of the
old flag, he concluded. "The stars in
that tiay, come from heaven. There is not
a downtrodden race but looks up to those
stars. That flag is the sun of liberty that
shines for alj. I have been wounded in
defense of Uat flag, and it is my honor
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
THE ASSEMBLAGE IN THE OLD PLAZA AS SEEN FROM BRENHAM PLACE YESTERDAY JUST AS THE FLAG WAS FLOATED TO THE BREEZE.
[Sketched by a " Call " artist.]
to-day in this assemblage of its loyal sup- I
porters to propose three cheers for the j
stars and stripes."
The cheers were given with right good- ;
will.
Harry Niemann, formerly of the Tivoli,
entertained the company with a German
dialect recitation, which was uimultunusly
encored. Then Gus Pullman, assisted by
Niemann and Sam Striker, sane "When '
iWe Ran With the Old Masheen." It was
a song that went directly to the hearts of
their auditors, and the hearty voices of ,
the youthful old firemen rang out in the i
chorus in a volume that belied their year;-. ;
Major Pico, one of the historic quests of
the occasion, was the next speaker. Major
Pico is a son of the man who presented
Portsmouth plaza to San Francisco, and
is one of the most prominent fitrures in
California history. The major spoke en
thusiastically of the honor which he felt,
not oniy in being a descendant of the Pico
family which had surrendered California
to the United States, but in being Himself |
a citizen of this Republic. "I am a true
American," he said, "and lam also a na- j
tive son. I would to-day be proud to go I
out and fight for that glorious flag if my i
country needed me."
One of the most prominent of the guests
of honor yesterday was Mrs. W. C. R.
Smithy whose brother, Joe Vasanez, had
brought from San Jose the flag that was
raised in this City fifty yeurs ago. "Cap
tain Leidesdorff sent my brother to Mon
terey to get the flag," said Mrs. Smith
yesterday, "and Joe made the trip on
horsebacK, keepine to the mountains and
to the brush in order to elude tbe enemies
who were on the lookout. My brother
finished his long ride in very quick time
and broueht the flag safely to this City."
Mrs. Smith, who is probably one of the
oldest native daughters in the State, was
born in San Jose. In 1843 her mother,
Mrs. J. J. Viogei, who had married the
first surveyor who laid out the plan of the
City of San Francisco, came to this City,
and S3on after her daughter followed.
Mrs. Smith, who owned up to having been
in her younger days tlie favorite girl with
tbe Americans in California, is the wife of
W. C. R. Smith, a prominent exempt of
old "California 4" and "Knickerbocker 5"
companies.

sup, J. J. Guilfoyle, Jo eph Figel, James
O'Donnell and J. J. Mundwyier, and the
banquet committee, consisting of William
Larkins, Charles W. McFarlan and Henry
A. Chase.
Judjje Robert Ferral was called upon,
and judging from the enthusiasm wnich
his remarks elicited made the speech of
the day. "1 am grown old enough and
have talked enough," he said, "to be will
ing now to take a back seat and listen to
others talk. I have been persuaded, how
ever, to make a few remarks. I am glad
to be among the veterans who are cele
brating nere to-day. They majce the
young fellow sashamed of themselves â and
lam one of the young fellows. If there is
anything that appeals to public honor
and to patriotism the Exempt Firemen
are always to the iront.

whitened their heads, the same spirit
that prompted them in their ycuths to go
forth and do battle with the fierce flames
prompted them to-day to come forth and
honor their native land. When this flag
was first raised over the City of San Fran
cisco this Sate siad thÂ« greatest ngnting
men in tbe world. Tt has been said iiere
to-day that in tbe Mexican War the Amer
icans never lost a battle. This ha been
denied by Mexican authority. They say
the Yankees were repeatedly defuattu,
but, confound them, they didn't know it.
"It has been said t: at no man in whose
heart beats the pulse of liberty looked
upon the flag which Commodore Sioat
haw raised without enthusiasm. But this
is a mi-take. There was one man.
"Soon after Commodore Sioat raised the
American flag the commodore of the
British navy, who had been .-ent out to
make a conquest of California, sighted
these shores. He sent one of his men
aloft and asked him whot he saw. The
man replied .c saw some ensign afloat.
'What is it?' asked the commodore, and
the man replied, 'It is tbe flag of the
United States Republic.'
"And then Commodore Collingwood
said, 'Damnation 1'
"We find that Sloat's action forestalling
the English Government gave us Califor
nia, Glad lam to be with you to-day to
honor Old Glory. I don't think there is a
man but who, when he saw that flag run
ud to-day and saw it kissed by the breeze
of heaven, thanked God that he was an
American and believed that it was tbe
finest piece of bunting in the world. I love
it, not because it is The most beautiful of
flags, but because it is the oniy flag liberty
has ever given us, and it represents all hu
manity.
"It is that flag that gives the liberty of
conscience. We may bow to different
a. tars, we may be Democrats, Popunst. or
anything you please, but above all we are
Americans, loyal to tbe grandest flag that
ever floated 'neaib the skies."
At the conclusion of Judge Ferrall's ad
dress he was given three rousing cneers
and then tbe Exempts started up the
chorus, "He s a Jolly Good Fellow," which
was joined in with a will.
Hany Niemann amused the assemblage
for a wnile. Jack McGreany, of the Poiice
Department, sang, "Tbe Engine That's
Housed on the Hill," and George Kinney
sang another song dear to the hearts of
Exempts, ''Seaman's Chief Again." In all
these the old firemen joined in the chorus
Charles Wilson, and old exempt, told a
number of interesting reminiscenses of
early days in the department, and warmly
eulogized the fire laddies of the volunteer
organizations.
James O'Donnell, another Exempt,
made a humorous and at times eloquent
address on the flag and the Fire Depart
ment. He regretted that he was not in
California when Captain Montgomery
raised the stars and stripes in San Fran
cisco. He explained that at that time he
was but 14 years ot age and nad not yet
left nis native land.
Proceeding more seriously hÂ« eulogized
the flag as the banner of religious and
civil liberty to which the down
trodder of every race looked hopefully.
As a fitting final to the celeoration three
rousing cheers were given for the flag, and
a stanza of "America" was sum;.
VETERANS ARE PLEASED.
Thank the Exempt Firemen for tha
Generous and Cordial Reception
Accorded Them.
The Veterans of the Mexican War met
last evening at their hall, 22 O'Farrell
street. All the members were highly
pleased at the success of the celebrations
at Monterey and yesterday at the plaza.
The first suggestion of having such a cele
bration was made at a meeting of the Vet
erans almost a year and a half ago, and it
was through the efforts of individual
members of the association that enthusi
asm was aroused in the matter.
Major Sherman especially has been very
active in bringing about the celebration,
and besides giving much of his time has
expended money in the cause. Last Dight
resolutions thanking Major Sherman for
all hr- has done to make the matter a suc
cess were passed, and will be suitably en
grossed and presented to the major.
The following resolution, offered by
Henry Schwartz, was also adopted by
the association :
Resolved. That the Mexican War Veteran As
sociation of San Francisco hereby expresses its
high appreciation of the generous and cordial
reception its members received from the Ex
empt Firemen of San Francisco on the fiftieth
anniversary of raising the American flag at
San Francisco by the commander of the United
States steamship Portsmouth July 9, 1846.
The following letters of thanKs were also
| sent to President George T. Bohen of th-
Exempts and Colonel William H. Menton
of the Southern Pacific for their courtesies
extended to the veterans during the cele
bration just closed:
George T. Bohen, President of Exemptsâ Dear
Sir: .f lease accept for vourselt and the Ex
empts ihe thunks of the Veterans of the Mexi
can War for the very elegant and hospitable
reception and entertainment received by them
from you on the fiftieth anniversary (July 9)
of hoisting the stars and stripes on Portsmuuth
I square. S. J. Loop, President.
Colonel William H. Menton, Passenger Agent of
i Southern Pacific Companyâ Bear Sir': Through
me the Veterans ot the Mexican War wish to
express to you their thanks for your kind at
tention an>l care in looking after their trans
portation to and from Monterey on July 7,

IS IT ALL FOR NOTHING?
Judge F. W. Van Reynegom
Thinks There Is No Fran
chise to Sell.
Legal Complications Likely to Arise
Over the Geary-Street
Grant.
The San Francisco Association of Im
provement Clubs has submitted to the
law and legislative committee of that
body the question of the legality of the
franchise lately passed by the Supervisors
to the Geary-street cable line.
This committee after considering the
law and tlie facts of the case have agreed
upon recommending the following report
back to the main body :
Firstâ As the franchise has seven years yet
to run the City has no franchise to >ell, it be
ing the property of the Geary-street, Park and
Ocean Railroad for seven years.
Second â One of thu conditions of the sale is
that the purchaser must commence the build
ing of the road within one year and comp.ete
it within three years, and as the present com
pany has posse^sion of the roadway and street
under its present franchise, and will have the
tame for seven years, it would be impossible
for any purchaser of the franchise, outside of
the present corporation, to comply with the
conditions of the sa.e. as possession of the
street could not be obtained ior seven years.
Thirdâ That as thU is evidently an attempt
of the present corporation to forestall the
provision of the new charter relative to the
sale of franchises, the board should be en
joined from proceeding further in the at
tempted sale.
Commenting upon the subject yesterday
Judne Van Reynegom said:
"Tbe matter of the proposed sale of the
Geary-street Railroad franchise by tbe
Board of Supervisors came under my con
sideration as a member of the committee
on law, legislation and public action of the
Associated Improvement Clubs, to which
committee a protest against the sale was
referred.
"To an outsider it looks as if a majority
of the Supervisors in voting to sell this
franchise now were treating a pubiic trust
as a private snap, although some ot those
who voted for it may have persuaded
thems-elves that it is the correct thing to
give the present owners of the franchise
an inducement to rebuild and improve tbe
road.
"The law of 1893 contemplates that there
shall be a bona-nde competition for the
purchase of a franchise of this kind in pro
viding that it shall be advertised for ten- I
dera or bids and awarded to the highest
bidder. Whether intentional or not the
advertisement of this franchise is so
worded as to effectually preclude competi
tion. The advertisement reads: Sâ < ii,,n
2. The foregoing is made upon the lollow
ing conditions, to be strictly complied wiin
by the said grantee, its successor* and as
signs: * â¢ Â» Fourthâ Work to 000*
struct said railroad must be connm-m-ril
within one year from the date of the panÂ«
ase of this order, and the same mn i In
completed within three years tbcrtt
"In view of the fact that the board will
not have any ri^ht to interfere with tin
possession of the present owner of thÂ«
iraucoise for seven years or more, it Ik
difficult to see how a successful bid.nr on
& sale at ;his time can comply with the
last-mentioned requirement. The board
simply has no such rich; to grant.
"The advertisement offering the fran
chise to the highest biddor it therefore
further oren to the objection that it con
tains the following unusual and unreason
able requirement: 'No bid for tbe franchise
herein referred to and offered for sale will
be considered unless the amount offered
therefor shaii be the sum ol $5000 or over,
and unKss accompanied with the sum bio.
in gold coin or a certified check, payable to
said clerk, which amount so bid on the
granting of said franchise to the success
ful and h guest bidder shall be, by said
clerk, paiu into the City and County
treasury to the credit of the Street Depart
ment fund.'
"Tbe usual rule in calling for bids is to
only* require sucu deposit with the bid in
ad w. nee as will be likely to insure good
faituÂ»on the part of the bidder. I opine
t:.atÂ«io one will care to deposit anything
like what this franchise for fifty years is
reasonably worth under conditions impos
sible of performance. It does not look like
a fair offer of the franchise to the highest
bidder, even if the Doard had any right to
grant it at this time. A franchise granted
under thes,e conditions would be heid by
uncertain tenure and be peculiarly vulner
able to attack."
Assuming this to be the legal status of
the case, the crooosed bargain and sale of
the franchise falls to the ground.
CENSURED THE ROAD.

WERE NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS
Mrs. Craven Was Too 111 to Appear
and Mrs. Haskins Is Out
of Town.
The entire day was consumed in Judge
Slack's court yesterday taking the deposi
tion of J. J. Cooney in the matter of the
proceeding brought by the special adniin-

istrators of the Fair estate to quiet title to
the two pieces of property which Nettie R.
Craven claims as having been deeded to
her by Senator Fair.
Mrs. Craven was too ill to be present.
Dr. Marc Levincston took the stand and
so testified.
Judge Slack announced that he intended
to go away on a two weeks' vacation, and
any matter not brought forward this week
must be postponed until August 3.
Mr. Del mas said he was ready to go on
with the matter of the will on twenty-four
hours' notice.
It was agreed to postpone the taking of
the deposition of Mrs. Craven until August
3, and with it this branch of the inquiry.
as George Knight refused to take up any j
other witness.
"Then," said Delmas, "we may proceed
at once to take the depositions in the will
contest."
".tirst come first served," said Mc-
Enerney. "We desire to take some deposi
tions in that matter."
"We are ready," said Delmas. "I would
have our witnesses called â I will call them
myself."
The names of the long list of attorneys
on the other side were called, including,
besides, Richard V. Deyâ he of the half- |
million contract. They were Garret Me- |
Enerney, Renben H. Lloyd, W. 6. Wood, 1
Charles S. Wheeler, Mountford S. Wilson,
Russell Wilson. George A. Knight, C. J.
Hecgerty, W. S. Goodfellow, W. M. Pier
son and R. B. Mitchell.
A half dozen of them did not answer.
Goodfellow had not been served, they
said; Mountford Wilson and Charles S. !
Wheeler were away on their vacations,
Hegserty would be in court in the after
noon, Wood and Pierson could be sum
moned from their offices.
"I will not consent to go on with this
matter until the witnesses summoned are
here in oourt," said .Delmas. " I will not
proceed with the matter In piecemeal as
the other is being done."
So this too was laid over until August 3, j
at which time all this other matters are on |
the calendar. This left the way clear for
the deposition of Mr. Cooney in the suit to
quiet title brought by the special adminis
trators against Mrs. Craven and others.
Mr. Cooney was called at the instance of
Delmas & Shortridge.
When Mr. Cooney was called a quiet
mannered young man responded and was I
sworn, and from that time until court ad
journed at 5 o'clock he was the center of
interest. Mild-mannered scarcely conveys
the idea in Mr. Cooney's case. "Indiffer
ent" is better. During all those hours he
was being constantly requested to raise his
voiceâ to "speak louder." But he did
not speak louder.
The direct examination closed at half
past 12, at which time in answer to Mr.
Delmas' questions the witness had told all
that The Call of yesterday said he would
tellâ that Senator Fair came into his office
and personally made the acknowledg
ments to the deeds â that he remembered
the circumstance perfectly well.
Mr. Delmas turned the witness over to
the other side and Mr. McEnerney tailed
for the noon recesÃ.
"I would prefer to go on," said Judge
Slack, "if we can finish with this witness
in a reasonable time."
"We cannot conclude with this witness
within a couple of hours," said McEnerney.
6o the recess was taken and at 2 o'clock
the audience and attorneys returned to j
their piaces with every prospect of a fine
afternoon's entertainmentâ of seeing Mr.
cooney cross-examined out of all sem
blance to his mild-mannered self.
Great was the The
witness was considerably more at his ease
under the cross-examination than be was
under the first flush of taking the chair.
His indifference grew upon him.
He produced a whole library of records,
including the boo* in which the entry of
i the Fair-Craven deed acknowledgments
| were made and a eashbook that developed
! nothing save some entries of the indebted
ness of some of the lawyers in the case
that provoked some amusement. The
witness simply and quietly repeated under
the close cross-questioning the story he
tola under the direct examination.
Judge M. Cooney, the witness' father,
j was in the courtroom during the whole
i day, a close listener to his son's testi
mony.
Miss Margaret Craven, Mrs. Craven's
daughter, sat with her mother's counsel,
Delmas and Shortridge and Lansing Miz
ner.
Mr. Delmas conducted the taking of the
deposition on behalf of Mrs. Craven, and
Garrett McEnerney, assisted by R. B.
j Mitchell, cross-examined.
The witness testified that he is 32 years
old, and was a notary public from Octo
ber, 1887, to January, 1895.
Mr. Delmas produced a photograph of
James G. Fair, whose likeness thÂ« witness
recognized. He then produced the now
famous deeds with their acknowledge
ments and declared the signature to the
latter was his own; that the seal was his
own.
Delmas read the acknowledgment: "Per
sonally appeared before me, Jame G. Fair,
known to me to be the person so repre
sented."
Witness said the facts set forth were
true. He said he had no personal ac
quaintance with Senator Fair at the time,
but knew him well by sight and could not
| have been mistaken. Then Delmas went
j into detail that no possibility of doubt
should remain.
"Who brought these conveyances to
you?" he asked.
"Mr. Fair."
"Who hand them to you?"
"Mr. Fair."
â¢'Who acknowledged them to be his and
to be signed by him ?"
"Mr, Fair."
"Did you after that fill out the certifi
cate of acknowledgement? 1 '
"I did."
"Did you make an entry in your books
i of this transaction?"
"I made a memorandum."
"Have you that book with you here?"
"I have."
The book was produced and the memo
randum read, as follows:
27. James G. Fair to Nettie R. Craven.
Deed date September 8,*694. Gift. Lot NW.
corner Eleventh, and Mission streets, N. 2 25
by 550.
11. James G. Fair to Nettle R. Craven.
Deed date Sept. 8, 1894. Gift. Lot SW. cor.
Pine and Sansome streets, 227}Â£ feet by 137'^.
The memorandum, as was all the others
in the book, was written in pencil.
Photographs of the deeds were pre
! sented by Delmas as exhibits, it not being
! the intention to leave the original docu
ments.
Here the recess waa taken. Mr. Mc-
Enerney began the cross-examination in
the afternoon by going into the history of
Mr. Cooney's appointment as notary by
Governor Waterman In 1887, and follow- I
i ing it until he resigned in 1895. His office
i was at 11 Montgomery street, in the Lick
House block, at the time Mr. Fair made
the acknowledgments referred to.
The witness could not remember what
time of day it was that Senator fair came
into his office, nor did he remember
whether he really came into the stall of
which his office consisted ; did not re
member what he said exactly; did not
know about the property conveyed in the
deeds; he had, however, a distinct recol
lection of tne Senator's visit.
Mr. McEnerney asked minutely as to the
circumstances, the number of chairs in
the stall, whether he was seated at his
desk or standing up when the Senator
came in, but the witness had no distinct
recollection of these circumstances.
He did not remember ever havinc seen
Senator Fair after this; did not know of
ever having taken the acknowledgements
of any other deed written in pencil. He
never spoke to any one about the circum
stance of the acknowledgements; was first
spoken to about the matter about two
weeks before the deeds were put on record.
George R. Williams and Stephen Roberts
came to him and asked if the signature
and seal were his ; he said they were. He
also told them that he remembered Sena
tor Fair coming into the office, bnt could
not recall what it waa about without look
ing up his record, but he would remember
it then. Witness kept no cash account or
record of his receipts as notary.
He identified the natarial record and
said that he knew what the deeds pur
ported to convey, aa the descriptions were
written there.
The records kept by the witness of his
business as notary from 1887 to the end of
1894 were produced. They were neatly
written sheets of yellow legal blank paper,
bound in parts containing each the record
of a year. The witness said these were
not the original entries, but that copies
had been made from the original and the
original thereupon destroyed â all except
the record of the last year which remained
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
as originally written. This contained the
entry in question.
He knew that the deeds referred to were
deeds of Rift. He did not know Mrs.
Craven; never heard of her before that
time; did not remember being introduced
to Mrs. Craven by Mr. Barkis at J. J.
O'Farrell's; did not know Mrs. Haskins.
Mr. McEnerney then called for the cash
book. The witness said he kept no cash
book â only a book showing indebted
ness to him. This was at his home. Mr.
McEnerney insisted on having it, and a re
cess was taken to allow him to get it.
The witness Drought the book, but it
revealed nothing relevant â a little in
debtedness by Knight & Heggarty that
caused a laugh.
This ended the inquiry. The books
were all offered in evidence by McEnerney.
Mr. Delmas stated that it had been
agreed to take the deposition of Mrs. Has
tms, but upon inquiry it was found that
she was at San Leandro. She could be
called into court to-morrow if desired.
Mr. Mitchell made objection against her
being introduced in advance of Mrs.
Craven. The whole matter, he thought,
should go over until August 3.
"I simply wanted to expedite the busi
ness," said Delmas, assenting.

SUFFRAGISTS WIDE AWAKE
State Precinct Work Is Rapidly

System.
The Rev. Anna Shaw, Her Vacation
Being Over, Will Lecture in
Oregon and the East.
"I believe in patronizing the weaker sex,
sol have a man dressmaker; and as I
have an appointment with him I must not
make the poor fellow wait too long."
The Rev. Anna Shaw was evidently
tired. She half reclined in a luxurious
easy chair in the elegant quarters of the
Woman Suffrage State Central Committee
and fanned her heated face with a clerical
looking handkerchief of spotless lawn.
The gifted lady, despite her recent fa
tiguing labors, looks well. Yesterday she
woie a natty tailor-made traveling costume
of pearl-gray tweed, set off by rows of
ornamental stitching and a few lustrous
mother-of-pearl buttons. A simple but |
fetching little hat crowned the wealth of
hair just beginning to show a few threads
of silver, and the bright, open counte
nance was charming in its tasteful setting.
"Yes." pursued Miss Shaw, "I am tired,
though I Lave been loaiing for ten whole
d ays. I have been enjoying a little outing \
in Santa Barbara and expected to rest '
there, but the drives in the neighborhood !
were so lovely that I could not resist the
temptation, and rode and drove all the
time.
"But," she went on in more serious
vein, "now I shall have to don the harness
again. To-night I leave for Oregon City
where I shall on Saturday and Mon- '

hope to return to California to await the j

the usually genial chairman of the State
Central Committee, was positively formid
able as she sat behind a towering breast
work of piled-up letters dictating replies
to a little army of bewitching, though un
approachable, stenographers.
"Our State work is getting on famously,"
she took time to remark, "and within a
brief space will be thoroughly organized.
The work in the interior has been oontided
to Miss Harriett Mills, Miss Laura Ran
dall, Mrs. Ida C. Hazlett, late of Colorado,
and Mrs. Owens of Chico. Mrs. Naomi
Anderson, a gifted and eloquent colored
woman of Sacramento, will tour the State
lecturing to members of her race, among
whom are said to be 12,000 or 15,000 voters.
"The papers have been uniformly kind
to us, and even the journals which have
opposed our cause have, generally speak
ing, done so in a decent manner.
"Of course," she concluded with a smile,
as she returned to her work, "we would all
swear by The Callâ if ladies ever did
swear, which they don't."
HE CUT HIS THROAT.
Attempted Suicide by a Patient at the
City and County Hos
pital.
Richard Clayton, a native of England,
about 38 years of age, went to the City and
County Hospital yesterday morning for
treatment.
He bad a cut in his right wrist which he
said had been inflicted in a fight with an
other man. The wound was drassed and
he was placed in one of the surgical wards.
By some means he got possession of a
razor, which was probably concealed in
his clothing, and during the afternoon cut
his throat, severing his windpipe and the
main arteries.
He was hurried to the ODerating-room
and the gaping wound stitched and dressed.
The physicians at the hospital said last
night that his chances of recovery were
doubtful.
Clayton refused to gire any information
about himself, but it was ascertained that
he had been living in the Prescott House
on Pacific and Kearny streets.
The probabilrW is that he had attempted
to commit suicide by cutting the arteries
in his wrist with the razor and the sight
of blood had made him weaken.

The Young Ladies' Institute enjoyed a
little relaxation yesterday morning in fin
ing officers and delegates for coming in
late. There was a good deal of fun at this
unexpected event, but the tardy ones hast
ened to set themselves right with the fin
ancial secretory as soon as possible.
After the usual order of business was a
thing of the past, amendments came up
for discussion. The most important oi

these, which divided the authority to in
terpret the constitution between the grand
president and the board of directors, was
adopted. Hitherto, that authority was
vested solely with the grand president,
but now she is merely one of . a board, of
which the directors are the, other mem
bers. "â  â  <*l >' â " ?<* "â â â -.' *â¢- f-U'i Â r r â¢
A letter was received from Archbishop
i Hiordan and read to the council, in which
he stated that the kind invitation sent
him to pay the Institute a visit was ac
cepted and that his Grace would be present
in the afternoon. Hf[[f
The duties of the committee on returns
were vested in the finance committee.
Several delegates who had been pie
vented from being present at the organiz
ing of the Grand Council were present at
this session. Among them was Miss Kitty
Callinan of Na pa. The Misses Ida Me Adam
and Maggie Madden of Watsonyille are
expected to be present to-day.
At the morning's session Father Cum
mines was a welcome visitor. His frequent
words of .advice and 1m droll humor did
much to enliven the meeting.
In the afternoon a law concerning proxies
was enacted. It provides that when dele
gates to the Grand Council are in any way
prevented from attending that body the
president of the local council or a substi
tute will be granted admittance.
Archbishop lliordan then arose amid a
profound and respectful silence and ad
dressed the assemblage in that eloquent
style for which he is noted. The silence,
however, did not last long; the Archoishop
was irresistible in his humor, and every
body was soon in a roar of laughter.. His
speech in general was devoted to advising
and encouraging the members.
' After suiting his pleasure at receiving an
invitation to attend -the Institute and
meeting the delegates he said:
' "The Young Ladies' Institute is now a
recognized factor in the religious world.
The period of your probation is passed,
and you have the sympathy of the public
to re-enforce you in your struggle to lift the
burden from the oppressed and to succor
the sick and needy.
"It has always been a source of pleasure
to me to view the conduct of all the
branches in the archdiocese. You have
done good spiritually as well as tempo
rally. As your ideal you have taken that
great and noble woman who 1900 years
ago gave to the world a Divine Redeemer."
After referring briefly to the various dis
tinctions in womankind arising ,of late
years, the Archbishop continued: "The
unbelieving man is saved by the believing
wife, and the an believing world is saved
by, . the believers. The - world . needs
woman's help; and the more unlike â  man
she is the broader is her scope, and' conse
quently the greater is her influence. This
may seem paradoxical, but it is true,
nevertheless. . '^ . â¢
"The influence for good which a woman
could wield over a man depends largely
on how closely she resembles his idealsâ
bis mother and his sisters." ; ,
Archbishop Riordan concluded his ad
dress with some strong words of encourage
ment to the Institute to be found always
in the 'foremost of the movement for
charity and humanity. :..-,.
The acting crand president, Miss Sophia
A. Grote. thanked, the Archbishop in be
half of the Institute for bis words of com
mendation and encouragement, and a re
cess was declared till 9:30 a. m. to-day.
In the . evening . a /grand musical and
literary entertuiumont was given at Metro

Institute. - " ' â¢
Just back 'of the platform had \ been
placed two large American flags, and the

M'KiNLLY COLORED CLUB.
Men of the Dark Race Ally Them
selves With Kepublicanism.
The colored menot San Francisco organ
ized a Republican club at California Hall
on Bush street last night, at which there
was a large attendance.
More than 150 men signed the roll and
pledged themselves to support the Repub
lican party, and do all in their power to
secure the election of William McKinley
for President of the United States.
E. J. Jackson, John H. Williamson,
Ctmrles N. Jamison, Joseph Pinkard and
R. R. Lockett were appointed a commit
tee on permanent organization.
They recommended that the name of
the cluo should be 'â¢Colored-American
MeKinley Republican Club." This was
unanimously adopted and the organiza
tion was named amid ereat applause.
The same committee recommended the
following-named members for officers:
j President, William N. Sanderson; first
vice-president, Georere W. Dennis; second
vice-president, W. R. Page; third vice
president. Rev. Stephen Severance; secre
tary, W. A. Butler; and treasurer, James

All of them were declared elected.
By the authority of the club the presi

made by the Rev. Stephen Severance, A.
A. Graner, A. A. Collins, President W. N.
Sanderson aud others, at all of which the
audience bhowed great enthusiasm and
prolonged applause as each speaker
touched the vital chord of the colored race
on the benefits brought to them under the
Republican party's administration.
CATHOLICS TO LECTURE,
The Young Men's Institute
Organizes a Labor
Bureau.
Officers Elected and Branches Estab
lished in California and
Nevada.
The Young Men's Institute now has a
lecture bureau which it proposes to em
ploy as a potent factor in spreading the
truth about the Catholic church.
At the recent Grand Council of the order
at Hay wards a resolution was adopted pro
viding for such an adjunct to the Youne
Men's Institute in this jurisdiction and
others. The selection of members wns left
to the grand president, and in conformity
with this plan Grand President Gallagher
has appointed the following as members
of the Central Lecture Bureau: Rev. P. C.
Yorke, Hon. J. F. Sullivan. Colonel James
F. Smith, Rev. James McDonald, James
C. O'Donnell, Thomas H. Fallon, Frank J.
Kierce and John Lynch.
'Ihese prominent members of the insti
tute have met and elected officers as fol
lows: Rev. P. C. Yorke, president; Frank
J. K. Pierce, vice-president; John E. Rich
ards Jr., secretary; John O'Donnell,
treasurer.
Almost immediately the work which the
bureau was designed to accomplish was
begun. Local bureaus have been estab
lished at Los Angeles and Sacramento,
Cai., and Virginiu City. Isev.
The central bureau will exercise a general
supervision over all lectures delivered
under the auspices of the Institute in car
rying out the provisions of the Grand
Council constitution relative to public lec
tures. It will only act, however, after
consultation with the local bureaus and
after having been advised of the localities
in their respective jurisdictions.
The members of the central bureau are
very enthusiastic and hope for the accom
plishment of great good as a result of these
public lectures.
It is believed that at the next meeting of
the central body a course of lectures will
be partially arranged.
HOT C MMIJ-TCIMSir.
Kii; lit Member* Added to the Republl-
can County Committee.
At a meeting of the Republican County
Committee at its Market-street headquar
ters last light eight new members of the
committee were appointed by Chairman
Manwaring, and the appointments were
confirmed.
Under the resolution adopted at the
previous regular meeting the chairman
was directed to appoint an additional
member of the committee in each district,
giving the committee a membership of
thirty-six instead of eighteen.
This step was taken to make the com
mittee still more representative of the best
elements of the party and to give it num
bers sufficient to attend well to the crowd
ing work of the campaign when divided
amoQg committees. C.. airman Manwar
ing is exercising great care in making his
selections, and in making them he is en
deavoring to satisfy as far as possible
everybody concerned. In some districts
several men have been urged for appoint
ment, and so it was that Chairman Man
waring did not have the full list ready last
night.
Those named and at once confirmed by
the committee were the following:
Twenty-ninth districtâ F. Hageman.
Thirty-first â William Smadeke.
Thirty-fourthâ R. Schleuter.
Thirty-fifthâ John T. Dare.
Thirty-seventhâ John A. McCarthy.
Thirty-eighth â John L. Coster.
Forty-second â Harry N. Gray.
Forty-fourthâ Philip Crongsgrill.
J. H. Thompson, county comuaitteeman
from the Thirty-fifth District, had urged
the appointment of John Daly instead of
John T. Dare, though he spoke highly of
Mr. Dare, and he waa so put out at his dis
appointment that he resigned his office as
treasurer of the committee. Harry N.
Gray was elected to the vacancy on mo
tion of J. M. Chretien.
THE CURTAIN DOWN
ON DR. BROWN,
He Left Yesterday for
Strawberry Point,
lowa.
A QUIET DEPARTURE.
Scores of Friends Accompany
the Pastor to the East-
Bound Train.
WIFE AND SON WENT WITH HIM
The So-Called "Independent Church"
Has Now Become a Thing
of the Past.
By yesterday morning's overland train
the Rev. Dr. Charles Oliver Brown left
the scenes amid which he had labored as
a pastor and suffered as an offender
against the moral law.
The warm, bright rays of the early
morning sun were gilding the waves of
the bay as Dr. Brown, surrounded by a
score or so of his most faithful friends,
turned his gaze toward the fast receding
city â the city in which ne had learned the
bitterness of criminal accusation and
the horror of mental tortureâ the city in
which he had also known the sweetness
which comes from friendly aid and con
solation.
On the wharf a crowd of bis parishioners
stood with tear-dimmed eyes waving their
adieu.
The departing minister seemed no less
affected than the flock which he was re
signing to the uncovenanted mercies of
destiny. On his right arm rested the wife
who had been the chief sharer in his
trials. On the other side stood Valentine,
the pastor's youngest son.
The boy aud his mother wept unfeignedly
as they saw the faces of dear friends be
coming less and less distinct aa the dis
tance increased. The pastor stood like a
soldier gazing upon the scene of a terrible
combat out of which he had come forth
alive, though sorely wounded, and then,
waving an inaudible blessing to the watch
ing crowd upon the wharf, he sought a
corner of the cabin, where he chatted as
freely and composedly as he could with
the knot of friends who were crossing the
bay with him.
"I will go to Chicago first," be said,
"and thence to Dubuque, lowa. There I
hope to meet my eldest son, who will take
us to his home at Strawberry Point, near
that city. There I hope to be restored to
health and strength again. Till I amweil
once more I cannot speak definitely as to
my future. It is !ik| that of my friends
and enemies, in the hands of God."
On reaching the Oakland mole the party
ascended the train which was in waiting,
and amid tears, prayers and blessing
Charles Oliver Brown, the man of mys
tery, imputed crime and unutterable suf- !
ferine, was whirled away, in all proba- i
bility never to return.
"Well, he' 3 gone," said Deacon Morse,
when the train had disappeared from view,
"His story was a strangely sad one. JDr.
Brown's worst and bitterest enemies must
acknowledge that he has shown himself to
be no coward. Our besc wishes follow him,
and I for one am sure that a happy life of
usefulness lies before him.
"When the dreadful scenes of the church
council and the Bay Conference were over,
a majority of the First Congregational
â¬hurch people wished to continue under
D.-. Brown's spiritual guidance. So they
inaugurated a series of voluntary meet
inps, over which they requested Dr. Brown
to preside. He consented. From the first
he met with every success, and all hoped
that under circumstances so eminently fa
vorable the doctor's health would rally
and he would soon become himself again.
"But these hopes were doomed. His
strength waned and last Sunday he col
lapsed. His being demanded rest, and he
has done well to cease his labors for a time.
"As for the 'Independent Church,' as
the newspapers call it, in the first place
there was never any such organization.
Dr. Brown's adherents merely held a series
of voluntary meetings and religious ser
vices. When we meet as a church again it
will be as the First Congregational Church
and under no other name.
"For the present the usual Sunday serv
ices will be dispensed with until the church
members can be brought together. The
Sunday-school and Christian Endeavor
meetings will, however, be continued with
out interruption. Meanwhile we will
await developments.
"The church building on Post street is
in constant need of care and repairs, and
its running expenses are much too high
for the present membership to bear. Still,
I was opposed to closine it, and only de
ferred to the united verdict of the trustees
in the matter, thoueh I was accused of
closing the church. We may worship there
again until we can find a purchaser for the
site, when we hope to build a new church
on Van Ness avenue. Thus far we have
not found a pastor, but will doubtless get
the right man soon. The story regarding
a Rev. Mr. Birch, published in one of the
papers, was made out of whole cloth.
"But," concluded the deacon, with a
tinge of reeret in his voice, "we will air
ways remember Dr. Brown and miss him."
SUING POP SULLIVAN,
Forty Thousand Dollars De
manded for an Injured
Reputation.
Hughes Was Arrested Four Times
at the Instigation of the
Saloon Man
"Poo" Sullivan has 3 pretty fight on his
hands. He has been sued for $40,000
damages by C. A. Hughes.
There is probably no one in San Fran
cisco Detter known to the men about town
and other local seekers after pleasure than
the proprietor of the Hoffman. For forty
years he has dispensed refreshments, both
solid and liquid, to the wayfarers within
the City's gates, and during that time there
are very lew who ever suspected the mild
mannered "Pop" of bearing malice. Yet
such may be the case, for Mr. Hughes,
through his attorneys, J. H. Henderson
and T. C. Kierulff, alleges that he has been
damaged to the extent of $10,000 on four
distinct occasions by actions of the de
fendant that are nothing if not malicious.
The complaint recites that on February
1, 1895, W. J. Sullivan procured the arrest
of C. A. Hughes on a charge of carrying a
concealed weapon, but that Judge Low
dismissed the complaint. For thus con
spiring to injure Hughes' good name,
reputation and business it is prayed that
Sullivan be assessed $10,000.
Again on February 1, 1395, Sullivan, not
to be balked of his revenge, filed another
complaint, charging Hughes with using
vulgar and obscene language and with try
ing to create a breach of the peace. Judge
Low convicted the defendant on this
charge, but the Superior Court reversed
his decision. For thus trying to injure
the complainant another $10,000 is desired
from the coffers of the saloon man.
On February 5, 18y5, a third charf, of
unlawfully carrying brass knuckles wa3
preferred against Hughes at the instiga
tion of Sullivan. Again did Judge Low
convict him and again did the Superior
Court reverse the decision. An additional
$10,000 is demanded for this persecution.
A fourth chargre, alleging assault upon
the person of W. J. Sullivan was made
against Hughes on February 5, 1895.
Judge Campbell dismissed it and a final
$10,000 is asked as a salve for this wound
inflicted upon Mr. Hughes' good name,
reputation and business.
The trouble between Hughes and Sulli
van dates back to an altercation about
Hughes bringing a colored woman to Sul
livan's place. Sullivan says he ordered
the pair to leave the cafe, and that Hughes
came back and assaulted him. The arrests
followed, the idea being that if Hughes
was convicted in the Police Court he would
lose his place in the office of Harry Wise.
Bar. Sullivan says that the cases in the
Superior Court were allowed to go against
him by default, because of an oversight on
the part of his attorneys.

the market lacked foreign support, and instead of

of St. Paul and other international favorites.
Furthermore, commission houses were without
orders, and there was a general disposition on the
part of the bulls to await the outcome of the Chi
cago convention. â  Speculation dragged along in a
listless manner until late In the afternoon session
u-nen the bears ana professional operators pro
ceeded to take advantage of the lack of interest
manifested by those usually arrayed on the bull
side.

to 1073,4. The stock at the opening was strength
ened for a lime by an advance of one-sixteenth of

The deceased was one of the charter
mem hers of Lyon Post, and has worked
hard to maintain its standing. He took
great int rest in Grand Army matters, and
was always a prominent figure at all pub
lic ceremonies, he was well known in
French circles on both sides of the bay,
and for eighteen years he wa3 the collector
for the French Benevolent Society. He
was very highly remembered by that
society at their annual meeting for his
faithful work.
When Lyon Post was first organised
Comrade Mongeiaz was a leading spirit
in the new post. Partly through his ef
forts the G. A. R. plat in Mountain View
Cemetery was deeded by the Cemetery
Association to Lyon Post. When the plat
was formally dedicated Coruraile Monge
lay presented to the post the first flag that
was ever hoisted at the plat. It was a
beautiful large nag, and is still preserved
as one of the relcs of tue post.
The deceased was a private of Alexander

enlisted October 7, 1863, and was honorably
discharged at the Presidio, April 26, 1866,
in accordance with a special order of
January of that year.
Charles J. Mongeiaz has been in busi
ness in this city for many years and has
always been noted for his enthusiasm in
Grand Army work. He was born in
Savoy over 72 years ago, and came tc this
country when very young.

soldiers' plat at Mountain View, and his
comrades will bury him with military

Mrs. George O. Perkins Jr. was suffi
ciently recovered this morning to explain
to her physician how yesterday's accident
happened.
No one was admitted to her presence, bat
Dr. McCullough made the following state
ment this afternoon:
"At 12 o'clock yesterday I received word
to go to Mrs. Perkins' house, that she had
either taken wrong medicine or too much
of some medicine. When I got there I
found her in a comatose condition. The
nurse was greatly excited and cculd not
clearly explain what had happened. Mrs.
Perkins was in a most serious comatose
condition, alternating with convulsions.
She has been a sufferer of hysterical con
vulsions for some time past. 1 firai in
jected apomorphia and subsequently
-irychnia and then sent for Dr. Sill as
â¢ unV.iltant. She responded to strychnia
and we continued that treatment for sev
eral hours, during wnicta period she was
out of her mind all ths time, and no in
telligible answer from her could be ob
tained to our queries. About 2a. m. she
became rational and was soon able to ex
plain everything. She said she was sit
ting at the dinner table, ani feeiing that she
v>aÃ troing to nave a hysterical attack she
went to a closet and got bol<l of a six-ounce
bottle of liniment which stood next to the
bottle containing the remedy for her at
tacks. She poured out a wiueglassful
and swallowed it. She immediately dis
covered by the taste that she had token the
wrong stuff and then tried to take an
emetic of mustard and water and told the
nurse to telephone for me. The emetic
had no effect and she soon became uncon
scious. On examination of the liniment
this morning 1 found it was composed of
the tincture of aconite and chloroform lin
iment, equal parts. There was enough of
quick acting poison in it to have killed
several people and it is a wonder the lady
is alive to-day. However, she is all right
now, but will be sick for a few days."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FJRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
THIRTEEN DUNCES
MAKE A POUND,
Faulty Spring Scales in
Use All Over the
City.
RESULT OF MANY TESTS.
Mayor Davie Trying to Devise
a Plan to Insure Honest
Weight
AN INSPECTOR NECESSARY.
Every Housekeeper Interested in the
Result of a Recent Com
plaint.
Oaklatto Omen Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 9. )
The little spring scales that are used so
commonly by nearly every storekeeper
will soon come under the official eye of
the city government. The matter, at
first sight, seems but a small one, but it
is one which has long been under consid
eration by hundreds of housekeepers.
The trouble witu the little spring scales
is that they systematically cheat the cus
tomers, and there is at present no redress.
A glimpse at the construction of the
spring scale will show how easy it is for
it to defraud customers. Tbe book on
which the scale is hung is connected with
the top of the spring, and every time a
parcel of goods is weighed the upper part
of the spring is the only part that works.
Probably goods weighing one or two
pounds are on the scales a hundred times
to every parcel weighing five pounds.
This, of course, lessens tbe power of the
spring at the upper eno, and, in the course
of time, weakens the wire. The result of
this is that a little less than a pound will
bring the indicator down to the one-pound
mark.
As the machine is kept in service the
resistance of the spring continues to de
crease until in some instances twelve
ounces will apparently weigh a pound.
Borne days ago a curious housekeeper, who
could not make ncr kitchen scales tell the
same story as was on her bills, made some
experiments. She went to half a dozen
stores in tbe center of town and made
purchases, carefully marking each one.
When weighed on the home scales every
package was short one to three ounces on
the pound. Some of the storekeepers were
informed of their faulty scales and could
not be convinced until they had made
several tests.
The matter has been laid before the
Mayor and in his next message to the
Council he will recommend that an ordi
nance be drawn up providing against such
methods in doing business.
"The affair has been called to my atten
tion," said Mayor Davie to-day, "and
after giving it a little thought I at once
saw what a really important matter it
was. It affects every small consumer in
the city, and the smaller tbe consumer
the more he is affected. I do not quite
see how the evil can be remedied, but I
have no doubt that the point lias been cov
ered in many other cities, and I shall
make inquiries. I have the charters of
many important cities in my office, and I
shall looK through them. The possibility
of fraud is so great that it would almost
justify the appointment of an inspector of
weights and measures. The duties might
be attended to by the license inspector.
Many matters of * much less importance
are regulate i by law.
"It would be a mistake to suppose that
the merchants are knowingly using weak
scales, because such is not the case. Tue
majority of the merchants, I feel sure,
will willingly co-operate in any move
ment to insure accurate weight and scales.
At the same time 1 have no doubt tuere
are many storekeepers who are knowingly
using false scales, and they should be
prosecuted.
"In Europe, I am told, this thing is care
fully regulated. An official inspector of
weights and measures visits every locality
annually, and a heavy penalty is imposed
on all storekeepers who do not present the
weights and scales for adjustment. Any
one found with weights that have not the
latest official stamp upon them is also
heavily lined. It would be a good plan to
have some such officer here."

Wheeler will be defended, as City Treas

was made with Treasurer Wheeler fully
five weeks ago, and when the mandamus
writ was served on the latter the papers
were handed over to Bruner.
When Bruner learned of his substitution
this morning he was more than angry.
"This is the most extraordinary act that
has come to my knowledge since 1 have
been an attorney," said he, "aud a singu
lar thing is that in the answer to tbe com
plaint there is not a denial of anything,
either specifically or generally. I shall
attend the case in the morning as a friend
of tne court, and urge that there is coliu
sion attempted in the payment of the war
rants. This movement in the case is to
forestall the decision in the case before
Judge Frick concerning the city."

Followed in Exterior and
Interior.
A MOST LUXURIOUS BALLEOOM
This Building Will B^ a Permanent
Social and Literary
Center.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, July 9. \
The beautiful Grecian home of the Ebell
Society will soon be a reality. It will be
the first woman's clubhouse in the city,
and will be a model of artistic work both
inside and out. The whole building will
be occupied by the ladies of the Ebell So
ciety and kindred organizations.
The new building is located at Thir
teenth and Harrison street? in the center
of the most aristocratic portion of the city.
New Home of the Ebell Society, Where Society and Literature Will Hold Sway.
Tbe Ebell Society will lease the wbole of
the building, and it will occupy a promi
nent place in the future social life of Oak*
land.
The building is of Grecian design both
inside and out. The lower Moor is laid off
into clubrooms and reception-rooms. The
Ebell library will also be on the first floor.
By an ingenious arrangement of the snace
and by the clever use of large sliding doors
tbe lower floor can be easily changed into an
auditorium. When this is done the > all
is in the form of a large Greek cross and
will be used for the lectures and meetings
of the society.
On the second floor will be a large ball
room and dressing-rooms and retiring
rooms for both ladies and gentlemen. The
ballroom will be 80x50 feet and will be the
largest floor in Oakland. At either end
the decorations are planned with colum
nal effect, so as to preserve the general
Grecian idea. The ballroom is to be fin
ished in ivory white and will be very
handsome. It will be the scene of many
very swell affairs in the future.
The need of such a building has long
been apparent to the literary ladies of Oak
land and the Ebell Society will concen
trate in their building all similar organi
zations. The large ballroom will be
available for use for private functions,
although subject to the control of the club.
Everything in the way of nttiugs will be
of the most ornate and classic character.
Walter J. Matthew), the architect, has
carefully followed the designs of tne ladies,
and the general verdict is that he has
planned a model ladies' clubhouse.
The Ebell Society is the most fashion
able and cultured in the city, and its
membership is rapidly increasing.
LOS ANGELES' CHAMPION
What Smith, Australian Pugilist,
Thinks of Heavy- Weight
Jeffries.
A Fighter Who Has Put Opponents to
Sleep With a Punchâ That Great
Finish Contest.
Joe Choynski has taken his departure
for Howell Mountain where he will rusti
cate for a few weeks. While Joseph is
resting at ease in the light and balmy at
mosphere of the high altitude his oppo
nent, Peter Maher, will be speeding across
the plains in the direction of San Fran
cisco,
Manager Groom says that the battle will
take place at the Mechanics' Pavilion on
the evening of August 5. It will be a
ten-round bout and the purse is $6000 in
cash.
There are many good judges of pugilists
and pugilism in this City who are not a
bit backward in saying that Jeffries, the
Los Angeles heavy-weight pugiiist, can
whip Choyntki or Maher. Jeffries made
a vorv excellent impression upon the spec
tators who witnessed the last contest in
the Pavilion when he disposed of his op
ponent in such Ml easy manner.
Billy Smith, the Australian boxer who
trained Jeffries, does not hesitate to say
that the big aucl easy-going youngster
who hails from the orange groves will
assuredly be honored champion of the
world in a few years hence if nothing un
foreseen happens in the interim to spoil
his chances for high honors.
"Why, the people have not the re
motest idea of the righting abilities of
tnis big boy," said Smith, yesterday, while
conversing on matters pugilistic and the
championship. "When Iwu boxing with
Jeffries the fellow actually was afraid to
hit me a hard blow with his big right fist
until I assured him that I could stand a
pretty good punch. Jeffries smiled and
said: "Billy Ido not want to let go very
hard because I have put many a big,
huskey fellow to sleep, and if, t>erebance,
I should land on your neck or chin, you
will go down and dream like the others.'
"I answered, 'Go ahead Joe, I want to
see how hard you can hit,' and I must say
ri^ht now that I was the biggest fool on
eaith for advising him thusiy. Having
avoided half a dozen smashes, any of
which would have knocked me senseless,
Jeffries tinaliy landed his big right Bst on
my neck as I ducked to avoid it, and down
I went.
"I quickly concluded that I had had
enough of that sport, and in a laughing
wav I informed my big 210-pound op
ponent that he could hit a little bit, and
here tne bout ended.
"Some people are inclined to think that
Jeffries is slow, but I know better. Of
course be did not have to resort to any
fancy foot work to whip Dan Long, but
when he goea up against some of those
firecrackers or crackerjacks, or whatever
else you wish to call tuem, then you will
see how slow this fellow is. Just think of
it, thi6 boy Jeffries fights at 210 pounds in
condition, and he is not yet 20 years old.
"Is he game? Well, "I never hit him
hard enough to know. He did not seem
to mind my punches, and I can hit a
pretty good lie* yet. I have an idea, how
ever, that the first man who hits him hard
enough to hurt him will receive in ex
change a smash that he will have good
reason to remember for many days. 1
think Jeffries is a wonder, and I predict
that in one year from now all those would
be champions will be leaving rrhatever
pan of the country Jeffries may visit."
Young Mitchell, the chieftain of the Oc
cidental Club, says that the club- will give
another exhibition in the Pavilion next
month and that in all probability Jeffries
and JacK Davis will meet on this occasion.
Mitchell is now negotiating with a prom
inent Eastern pugilist with a view of
matching him against a very clever wel
terweight.
With few exceptions the sporting men
of this City never expect to hear of the
Sbarkey and Corbett right ever taking
place in this country. One noted sporting
man said that if the pugilists had agreed
to meet in a contest of twenty rounds â
provided a finish fight could not be
"pulled off" within a year from the time
of signing articles â the public would take
some consideration of the match, but as it
now stands the sporting fraternity look
upon the announcement of a finish fight
as being purely an advertising scheme.

THE PRESIDIO BARRACKS.
M. McGowan and E. J. Lawton
Were the Fortunate Con
tractors.
The Difference Between Municipal
Management and That of
Uncle Sam.
Bids were opened yesUrday by Colonel
A. 8. Kimball, deputy quartermaster
general of the United States army, for the
construction of two large two-company
barracks at the Presidio
The lowest bids were as follows: M.
McGowan, for the construction of the two
buildings, $74,700, and for placing 272
lockers in them $1500, these two specifica
tions being taken conjointly. E. J. Law
ton, for plumbing of both buildings, $4250,
and for gaspiping tnerein $290.
The bids have been telegraphed to the
quartermaster - general at Washington
with the recommendation that the award
of contracts be telegraphed to-morrow to
the above-named bidders, the bidders be
ing responsible and their prices reason
able.
There were in all thirteen bidders. Mc-
Gowan is the contractor who constructed
the Palace Hotel, the Phelan building and
other large structures about town.
The work will be required to be com
menced on or belore August 1, 1896, and
muse oe completed at as early a date as
possible, not later than December 31, 1896.
The new brick structures will take the
place of the old wooden building now in
use aud will furnish accommodations to
four troops, either of cavalry or artillery.
The work covered by the specifications
consists of the construction of two-com
pany barrack buildings, the foundations
and underpinning to be of stone, footing
courses oi concrete, superstructure and
piers of brick, the roof of building and
dormers to be covered with slate and the
roof of the porch with tin.
All the stone will be obtained from the
Government quarry at Angel Island and
the brick work is specified as sound, well
burned brick of Ban Jose manufacture, or
brick equally as good.
The remainder of the specifications call
for the best material obtainable. The
buildings will be substantial and hand
some and similar in style to those recently
constructed on the reservation by the Gov
ernment. The accommodations for the
men will be equal to those of a first-class
hotel and contain all the modern improve
ments for health and comfort.
In reading over the specifications one is
strongly Impressed with the difference ex
isting between municipal management of
such an undertaking and the methods em
ployed by Uncle Warn. The contractor is
bound down in the minutest detailsâ the
atone tilling, earth filling:, the thresholds
and coping-stones are all thought out
beforehand and directions are piven for
the proper way of carrying out the con
tract in every little detail.
There is no chance, should any contrac
tor be so inclined, for sharp work out at
the Presidio. On the other hand he lies
awake of nights praying that the result
of his utmost endeavors may Drove satis
factory to his exacting client. Nothing
has been overlooked, everything has been
provided for and the description and di
rection thereof printed in the technical
terms of the contractor's vocabulary.

TO MAKE SAILORS
OF THE BOYS.
Captain W. L. Merry Sug
gests a School of
Navigation.
DIRECTORS DISLIKE IT.
It Would Require a Ship and
Altogether Be Very
Expensive.
THE UTILITY OF EDUCATION.
Present Financial Appropriations
Don't Sanction New and Costly
Experiments.
The latest improvement contemplated in
connection with the curriculum of the
public school system of education is a
class or a school in which boys may be
taught navigation. Tne idea was sug
gested a few days ago by W. L. Merry, the
secretary of the Chamber of Commerce,
who addressed a letter upon the topic to
Superintendent Madison Babcock.
Since San Francisco is one of the lead-
Ing seaport cities of the United States the
boys, in the opinion of Mr. Merry, should
be given a chance to learn how to box the
compass, reef a topsail and navigate a ship
or steamer across the briny deep. "There
nas not been any school of this class in
the City since the death of old Captain
McNevin some years ago, and," says Mr.
Merry, "why should not the State prepare
boys to go to sea as well as to train them
to become carpenters and machinists, etc.?
They do so in New York, Boston and other
seaport cities of the East, and I am una
ble to see why we should not adopt a sim
ilar policy in San Francisco."
The letter of Mr. Merry was sent by Su
perintendent Babcock to the State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction, Samuel T.
Black, who in his answer says:
"I am quite sure that it would be perfectly
competent for the Board of Education to
establish such a school in connection with
cither one of your hiph schools or the Poly
techlc School, or if deemed best, it mi?;ht bo
maintained as a separate school. I call your
attention to section 6 of article 9 of the con
stitution of California, which states that the
public school system may include 'such tech
nical schools as may be established by the
Legislature or by municipal or district author
ity. 1
"Permit me to express the hope that your
Board of Education will give the suggestion
of W. L. Merry careful consideration."
The school sages freely admit that naviga
tion is a useful art and all that, but they say
there are many other equally useful arts and
the line must be drawn somewhere. The
finances, too, of the department are limited,
and it is a question not of what should be done
for the education of the rising generation, but
of what can be dene, and of the many studies
presenting themselves, which are the most ad
visable.
"Our system of public school education,"
said Director C. A. Murdock, chairman of the
classification committee, "is not Intended pri
marily to teach trades or to fit our boys and
girls to earn a living, but rather to eive them
an intellectual grounding, which will serve as
a basis for any pursuit they may follow after
leaving school."
"Navigation," said Director Comte Jr., "Is
unquestionably a good thing; so. for that matÂ»
ter, is all knowledge, bat the problem we must
study is the urgent needs of the School De
partment. I accordingly conclude that until
all of our schooihouses are put in a sound san
itary condition we cannot consistently con
sider the idea of establishing a school in navi
gation. Why. to do this we should need a
ship and a corps of special teachers, and the
expense would be considerable."
"We havtm't a bean tc spare," said Director
Knox, "consequently I don't see what would
justify us in introducing a new and expensive
study, no matter how useful it might be."
PETTIGREW IN PUMZE
Will Change the Complexion of the South
Dakota Legislature.
ABERDEEN, 8. D., July 9.â Senator
Pettigrew, who bolted the Republican
National Convention at St. Louis, cuts
considerable of a figure in the State Con
vention of that party. The Senator has
a strong personal following that has
always stood by him in his political cam
paigns. At the same time the State is
Republican by 14,000 majority and the
gold leaders are in control. There is no
question that the Senator will change the
complexion of the next Legislature, partic
ularly as a larce majority of the last Leg
islature was elected by pluralities ranging
from one to fifty.

entered teams in the race and of several
other clubs have called runs to witness the
finish. There is considerable rivalry over
the event, though it is generally thought
that the Acme Club has the strongest

OPEN REVOLT OF
ABLE DEMOCRATS.
Financial Plank of the Chi
cago Convention Utterly
Repudiated.
DISASTER EXPECTED TO FOL=
LOW A SILVER POLICY.
Seceders Say the Wages of Working
People Will Not Advance, but
the Cost of Living Will.
A free silver policy is impossible. It Is the creation of demagogues. No
Democrat can afford to support such a policy. â¢ â¦ â¦ Free coinage means noth
ing less than free robbery. * * * I will not sustain the platform of the party
and do not see how any candid-minded Democrat can. * â¢ â¢ The convention
at Chicago is made up of demagogues, socialists and communists of the worst
kind. â¢ * â¢ The result of a national declaration for free silver would have the
effect of making gold a merchandise and ruining every branch of trade and com
merce. * * * It will be hardest on the salaried people. Laboring classes who
have been led into this fallacy and vote for free silver will live to curse their
leaders and hang them if they can.â Kaphael Weill.
The free coinage of silver will brine to this country tne uncertainties and
embarrassments which attend the transactions of mercantile business in the
silver countries. â¢ â¢ â¢ I have been obliged to pay in Guatemala* SLBO in silver
for Sloo in gold. The bankers and brokers there get control of all the gold.
* * * It will be the same here in the United States if the free coinage oT silver
Is introduced. Gold will vanish. It will be withdrawn from circulation and
held at a high premium. â¢ â¢ â¢ The workingman who expects to be benefited
by the free coinage of silver will be grievously disappointed, for in all silver
countries the standard of wages is low.â Louis B. Parrott.
A general talk with leading merchants l
of San Francisco who have long been iden- j
titied with the Democratic part}' will con- !
vince any one tnai the bolting on account
of the position of the party on the money
question is the rule rather than the excep
tion in commercial circles. Merchants do
not express dissatisfaction in that ordi
nary form which implies displeasure
over party management, but a calm deter
mined resolution to break away from
party lines and affiliation is openly pro
claimed.
It is the judgment of careful observers,
among them prominent Democrats, that
two Democrats will bolt the Chicago nomi
nation on account of the free silver
declaration to every one Republican that
will leave his own party because of the
action of the St. Louis convention in
declaring for the gold standard. It is an
acknowledged fact that the bolting Repub
licans will join the Populists, while the
bolting Democrats will join the Republi
can party and vote for the maintenance of
a sound money in gold and silver.
The Call yesterday announced that
such old-time Democrats as Thomas B.
Bishop, E. B. Pond and A. A. Watkins
would never subscribe to the financial
doctrines enunciated by the Democratic
National Convention at Chicago. There
are others equally prominent and as fully
determined to renounce the Chicago plat
form as contrary to the principles of the
Democratic party. These leading Demo
crats are John Garber, Louis B. Parrott,
Raphael Weill, D. N. and E. Walter,
James Gibb, J. W. Twiggs, L. Kian and S.
Koshland. Some of these dissenting
Democrats will vote for McKinley and
Hobart in order to avert a public calamity.
Others may remain passive until the men
now controlling the Democratic party
come back to the old ideas.
Louis B. Parrott, a time-honored mer
chant of San Francisco, who has been a
life-long Democrat, says distinctly and
without qualification that he will not vote
for the nominees of the Chicago conven
tion. He said:
"I know what the free coinage of silver
means to the business interests of the
United States. I have had experience in
Guatemala, where commercial transac
tions are conducted on a silver basis â
where the money of the country is silver.
The free coinage of silver will introduce
in this country the uncertainties and em
barrassments which attend the transac
tion of mercantile affairs in the silver
countries. In buying London exchange in
Guatemala I have been obliged to pay $180

]in silver for $100 in gold. The bankers
! and brokers there got control of all the
gold. It will be the same in the United
States if this free-coinage scheme is intro
duced. Gold will vanish. It will be with
drawn from circulation and held at a high
premium. Men who work for daily wages
and monthly salaries will be paid in
silver, but the wages will not increase nor
salaries yo higher.
"It will take seven or eight silver dol
lars to buy the same commodities which
one can now purchase for five dollars in
gold. The workingman that expects to be
benefited by the free coinage of silver will
be grievously disappointed, for in all sil
ver countries the standard of wages is
low.
"Yes, I have been a Democrat all my
life, but I will not follow the leaders in
the Chicago convention, who have gone
crazy on the silver question. They are
not Democrats and do not represent the
Democrats of this country."
Rapaael Weill, the senior member of
the firm of Raphael Weill <fe Co., is as
well known as a time-honored and patri
otic member of the Democratic party as is
the "White House" as one of the leading
mercantile establishments of the City. Ac
cording to his own confession "he has
voted fora Democratic principle when he
knew that for the time being it would
injure his own business."
Mr. Weill was seen at his private apart
ments in the Bohemian Club yesterday
afternoon, and readily consented to give
his views on the money question, reserv
ing the right to hit the Republican party
a few hard licks on the side. "A free sil
ver policy," he said, "is impossible. It is
the creation of a demagogue. No Demo
crat can afford to support such a policy. I j
am a Democrat and always have been a
Democrat, but I am emphatically against
the free coinage of silver. Free coinage of
silver means 'free robbery' â nothing else.
I will not sustain the platform of the
party, and Ido not see how any sound
minded Democrat can â though I do not
wish to be understood as declaiing in
favor of Republicanism. The convention
at Chicago is not representative of the
party. It is made up of demagogues, so
cialists and communists of the worst
stamp. I believe in the Democracy of
! thirty years ago. The free-si'ver idea is
inconsistent with true Democracy. Thirty
years of Republicanism has brought about
this condition of political affairs in the
country, and the present upheaval is
simply a natural opposition to plutocracy.
"The result of a National declaration
for free silver would have the effect of
making gold a merchandise and ruining
every branch of trade and commerce. It
will be hardest on the salaried people.
The r^ch men can stand these changes in
the political policy of the country. They
can look ahead and see what is coming.
Two or three years of a calamitous policy
I do not make so much aifference to them,
but the poor men have to bear the burden
j unaided. They get less for their labor and
pay more for their living, but they will not
.â¢â ee it until the mischief has been done
and the whole country has suffered terri
ble loss. Within two years the masses who
have been led into this fallacy will rue the
i day they ever voted for free silver in case
| the party advocating that policy is suc
| cussful in the coming contest. They will
j curse their leaders and hang them if they
j can.
"W bile I have always been a practical
Democrat, I am not aiiaid to stand by my
j convictions, even though I have to aavo
; cate the policy of the other party. I voted
I for the Wilson tariff, knowing that its
adoption would cause me Joss by reducing
value of nearJy all the goods in my store!
| But 1 believed in the principie, just as I
now believe that free silver would ruin the
country. No man who has any business
or other interests in the country can afford
! to indorse such a policy with his vote.
I Neither can any man who takes an inter
est in the welfare of the country think of
voting for free silver."
'â¢Do I believe that the Democratic mer
chants are in favor of free silver?" re
sponded D. N. Walters of the firm of D.
N. Walters <fc Co. when approached on the
j subject by a Call reporter yesterday.
j "Have you found one yet ?" incredulously.
j "I do not think there is a sane Democrat
wlio has anything to do with commerce in
this City who does not denounce such a
policy on the part of his party in the
strongest terms. It means calamity
wholesale calamityâ for this country. No,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 10, 1896.
I do not believe the Democratic merchants
will stay with the party it a silver plat
form is adopted at Chicago. If we have
free silverâ or, in other words, if there was
a National declaration to that effect, which
I cannot believe is among the possbihties
of our political futureâ it will mean total
ruination.
"But the ereat evil and menace so far as
this great issue is concerned is in the
ignorance of the laboring classes. Whether
it is ignorance or simply a failure to un
derstand it amounts to the same thing,
and if a free-silver candidate is elected to
me Presidency it will be by the vote of
the wage-earners. And they will be the
first to suffer. They don't seem able to
grasp that idea, though, and it will not be
brought home to them until tney have to
pay a third more for the necessary com
modities of life than they do now and
have to work for less money. They may
still get their $2 or S3 a day the same as
now, but it will be in silver and less in
purchasing power on a ratio with the
difference between the value of silver and
gold. If the laboring man has $10 in
silver, we will say, it would buy only as
much as $7 50 or $8 in gold. A coat he
can buy for $4 now he would have to pay
$5 50 for with his tree silver.
"It is the 'free silver' that sways the
mind of the masses. They think it means
more money, cheaper living and higher
wages. Yes, I shall vote the Republican
ticket if my partv â or as much of it as is
represented at Chicagoâ declares for free
silver, and all the Democratic merchants
that I have talked with will do the same." |
L. Klau of the house of Uass Bros, has
had experience in Guatemala and Salvador,
where commercial transactions are con
ducted en a silver basis, and that experi
ence has taught him that the free coinage
of silver would bring calamity to the
United States. He has been a consistent
Democrat, standing by his party in defeat
and victory, but he now feels it to be his
duty to vote for McKinley. He said yes
terday :
"A merchant doing business on a silver
basis never knows where he stands. An
article which he purchases in the morn
ing for $10 50 may be down to $10 in the
afternoon. Everything is governed by
the price of silver in London. The value
of gold never changes, so on a gold basis
business may be transacted with security.
My experience in Salvador, a silver
country, fully made known to me the
embarrassments, difficulties and uncer
tainties of conducting a commercial busi
ness on a silver basis. Free coinage of
silver would, in my judgment, introduce
in the United States the same business
methods that prevail in Salvador and
Guatemala. Why, it was impossible to
tell in buyine on payments to be made in
sixty days what amount would have to be
paid when the obligation fell due. It
might take $300 in silver to pay for goods
that were worth $200 when ordered. We
actually got to that pass that we imported
boxes of silver â $3000 in a box â from Lon
don and Paris. We bought it where we
could buy it on the best terms. When the
Government found that we were bringing
it in an import tax was placed on it.
When we had too much silver and sought
to export it an export tax was imposed by
the Government.
"To-day in the South and Central Ameri
can countries it takes 200 cents in silver to
buy 100 cents in gold. The same state of
affairs will be brought to the United States
if free coinage comes. It will bring to
every commercial enterprise peril and
confusion. A merchant will never know
bow he stands. Trade will be subjected
to all the fluctuations of silver in the Lon
don market, for whatever may be said its
price is there regulated. There will be
constant danger of an increase in liabili
ties and a decrease of assets.
"No, the Democratic merchants of San
Francisco will not follow the leaders of
the party in the Chicago convention on
this silver proposition. In a word, they
will vote for gold. Free coinage of silver
can bring no prosperity. It can only
bring calamity and disaster. The talk
about wages being increased is folly. In
silver countries the wages for labor are
down to 20 cents n day. Wages here
might remain as now established on the
gold standard at $2 and $2 50 per day, but
tne $2 50 would not buy as much as one
can now purchase for $1 25.
"Amone merchants," continued Mr.
Klau, "I near only one opinion expressed,
and that is the opinion that free coinage
of silver would bring about sucn disaster
as we have never encountered. Ol course,
l cannot account ior the craze in Chicago.
Men seem to have lost their reasoning
faculties.
"I am not prepared to say what ef
fect the introduction of silver would
have on the savings banks. It is natural
to suppose that depositors who deposited
gold would want gold in return. I am
sure that gold would be withdrawn from
the United States the same as it has been
taken from Salvador and Guatemala. The
greatest hardships, I am sure, would fall
on the working classes, whose wages
would uot be raised, but the price of liv
ing would be advanced. Every imported
article, such as tea, sugar and coffee,
would have to be paid for in gold. If any
advantage should follow it would go to
the bankers, brokers and speculators.
"The leaders in the Chicago convention
are not representing the Democrats of the
country. As far as 1 can ascertain the
merchants of California prefer the gold
standard. Some Democratic merchants
who are very firmly and closely wedded to
politics may remain passive and decline to
vote at the next election, but when the
issue is fairly presented with gold on one
side and silver on the other I think that
neariv all will be found in favor of main
taining the doctrine of sound money as
against the silver inflation. The commer
cial men of the country have too raucn at
stake to remain passive and indifferent.' '
James Gibb, importer of wines and
liquors on Merchant street since 1852, has
always voted the Democratic ticket, but
he is convinced that Democratic merchants
and business men will break away from
the ] arty in view of the declaration in
favor of the free coinage of silver. He j
said yesterday: "I do not believe in talk- i
ing much, but I do say that the men who j
are committing the Democratic Conven- j
tion to the free coinage of silver are going j
contrary to the sound-money principles of !
the party. Yes, I hear of leading Demo
crats who will bolt the nominations.
They may not say very much now. They
will remain passive, hoping that the sec
ond sober thought will convince the men
who are now carrying things with a high
hand that they have made a mistake."
John W. Twiggs is a Democrat of the
old school, but he has said frankly that he
cannot support the lree-coinage doctrine
of the party. He will vote for McKinley
and a sound currency.
Samuel O. Meyer of H. Levi & Co., is a
young man, but since he began voting ten
years ago be has been a steadfast Demo- {
crat. At the next Presidential election he j
will cast his vote for McKinley. He has !
positive views on the money question and
thus expresses his sentiments: "The
money now in use is the beat. lam satis
tied with it and do not want any change
from a gold to a silver basis."

Met it Jones Streeti
Democrat of considerable prominence.
He has been a member of that party since
casting his first vote, which was many,
many years ago, and among the Demo
cratic merchants -he may be taken as a
representative of the sound, conservative
class. He expressed himself to The Call
last week on the question of tariff, in
which be asserted emphatically that pro
tection and not silver was the issue in this
State. He feels strongly on the money
question and has no hesitancy in the ex
pression of his convictions.
'â¢A silver policy would ruin our busi
ness. We could not carry on our commer
cial affairs without consulting the Liver
pool quotations or the value of silver three
or four times a day, and then it would be
hard to tell where we stood. 'Free silver,'
so called, is impossible. 'Frea silver' ex
ists only in the minds of the deluded
laborer, who thinks he will have more
money under a silver policy.
''All the Democratic merchants with
whom I have talked are against it. They
know it will bring about a terrible com
mercial and financial condition. It is also
safe to predict that the majority of our
Democratic merchants will refuse to vote
for their party candidates on a silver plat
form, if they do not vote for and support
the Republican sound money ticket.
Those are my sentiments, and I think you
will find very few thinking Democrats to
dissent from them."
Mr. Hass, a prominent merchant of Los
Angeles, was seen at Hass Bros., whole
salers and importers, yesterday afternoon,
and he said that all the Democratic mer
chants he had beard discuss the subject in
the southern city were emphatic in their
denunciation of a free-silver policy. "I
am not a Democrat myself," he said, "but
the mercantile and commercial interests
of Democrats and Republicans are identi
cal. If free silver should be adopted as
the policy of the Government it would
bring a great crisis. It would be worse
than a panic. It would be a cyclone.
Unless all the voters are crazy, I don't
thick it will ever come to that; but it is
hard to tell what the laboring class may
do If it runs away with a wild Idea such as
that free coinage means 'free dollars' in
the pocket. I nave met many of the
prominent mercantile men among the
Democrats of your City, and I have yet to
iind one who is not bitter in his opposi
tion and denunciation of the silver policy
of his party."

their party; they will vote for gold."â L.
Klau.
"It means wholesale ruination to the
countiy."â D. N. Walter of D. N. & E.

RAN AWAY AND
MARRIED AT SEA,
Pearl Goodnow, a Yolo
County Belle, Was
Under Age.
HER FATHER OBJECTED
But M. K. Nickell, the Groom,
Was Not to Be Deterred
by Difficulties.
CAME ON THE MORNING TRAIN
They Were Married on the High Seas
in the Afternoon by Captain
Parker.
M. K. Mitchell and Pearl Good now of
Yolo County are now man and wife. They
were joined in the holy bonds of wedlock
on the high seas yesterday by Cupid Par
ker, master of the gasoline launch Belve
dere. It was a runaway match and the
bride half repented before the Golden Gate
was passed. Both of the participants in
the ceremony were seasick.
Pearl is sweet 17 and vowed as she
stepped ashore at the Clay-street landing
that she bad never been kissed. Her hus
band was unable to salute her and Captain
Parker never got a chance, as the Belve
dere was rolling and pitching like a ship
in a gale and it took him all his time to
get Ine boat straightened out on the home
ward run. In spite of her pale looks and
disheveled appearance the yoniiK lady ap
peared very handsome as she stepped
ashore from the launch.
M. K. Nickell gave his age as 28, and he
looks what he isâ a hard-working farmer.
He is well built and strong, but he was
not strong enough to overcome old ocean,
and instead of upholding his wife he had
to be held up himself while the ceremony
was performed.
Mrs. Nickell is the daughterof a rancher
who lives near Capay, Yolo County, and
Her husband is the les3ee of part of her
father's land, and also a deputy Sheriff.
The wiiole of the property is in wheat
large shipments ol which are made an
nually from the landing to Port Costa and
San Francisco. Naturally Pearl and her
lover were thrown a great deal together
and they learned to love each other. Mrs.
Goodnow rather favored the suitor, but
Papa Goodnow was set against it, and as
the young lady was under age there was
nothing to do but run away and get mar
ried at sea.
The trip to San Francisco was hurriedly
taken and once here the search for a tug
was begun.
The bride-to-be was left at the Grand
Hotel and the groom-elect paid a visit to
the water front. He visited the Spreckels
tugboat office on Folsom-street wharf, but
none of the tugs were disengaged. He
then went to the Shipowners' and Mer
chants' Towboat Company, but could not
come to terms with the superintendent.
Finally one of the boatmen directed him
to the Belvedere.and Captain Parker, after
making some inquiries, agreed to perform
the ceremony on the high seas.
They were unattended and the deck

hand and steersman on the steamer had
to act aa witnesses to the ceremony.
Last evening Captain Parker and the
bride and groom enjoyed a quiet little
dinner and over a class of wine the gal
lant skipper presented Mrs. Nickell with
the certificate of her marriage. As the
Belvedere went more than the stipulated
three marine leagues off shore there can
be no doubt but that the ceremony is
binding.
The couple is now anxiously awaiting
word from the bride's father. When he is
heard from they will return home and
make their peace.
