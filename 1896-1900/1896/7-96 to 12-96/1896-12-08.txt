PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S FINAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.

v â  : IÂ«iifi'Â« message was presented to Congress this morning;. Per
'â " .".liaps the most interesting portion of the message is that re
.â 'â¢'.[, luting to the debts due the Government by the Pacific bond
â¢-. Raided railroads. In plain language the President says it is
â¢-.â â¢â¢ â â¢â¢ti.mo that proceedings were taken to collect these debts, by
â â¢â  " -.foreclosure if necessary.

' ;':purrcncyare repeated, and foreign relations are reviewed at

â¢ ..' \ the Independence of the island will be the only final settlement
.' â¢Of the warfare that is now blighting the "Gem of the An
;â¢_â  tilles." Appended is the message in full:
o#".o # ". ; To the Congrees of the United States: As representatives of the people in
." . the legislative branch of their Government you have assembled at a time
â¢' â¢ -when the strength and excellence of our free institutions and the fitness
â¢' of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A
V ". political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with fever
'" ish apprehension and creating aggressiveness so intense as to approach
â¢'. . bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout our land, and deter
.'â¢ mined by the decree of free and independent suffrage, without- disturb
ance of our tranquillity or the least sign of weakness in our National
Â°' structure.
j 'â¢ When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obe-
I i and manly submission which have succeeded the peaceful obe
dience and manly submission which have succeeded a heated claÂ«h of
I political opinions we discover abundant evidence of a determination on
the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will,
and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies estab
lished for the direction of the affairs of their Government. Thus our
V-, people exhibit a patriotic disposition, which entitles them to demand of
those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and
unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious
appreciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance oi public
duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional requirement I hereby submit to the
â¢;, â¢' Congress certain information concerning National affairs with the sugges
tion of such legislation as in my judgment is necessary and expedient.
To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration I shall omit many details
concerning matters within Federal control which, by no means unimpor
tant, are more profitably discussed In departmental reports. I shall also
further curtail this communication by omitting a minute recital of any
minor incidents connected with our foreign relations which have hereto
â .â :. fore found a place in executive messages, but are now contained in a re
port of the Secretary of State, wnich is herewith submitted.
DEMAND OF HUMANE CIVILIZATION.
At the outset of a reference to the more important matters affecting
- " our relations with foreign powers it would afford me satisfaction if I could
assure the Congress that the disturDed condition in ' Asiatic Turkey had
fff during the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspect, and that
,' â¢ .either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish Government to
the demand of humane civilization or as the result of a decisive action on
': the part of the ere.it nations having the right by treaty to interfere for
â¢" â¢ " the protection of those exposed to the rage of bigotry and cruel fanaticism
{.... ..the shocking features of the situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a softened disposition or protective
Â°.o. o 'â¢intervention we have been afflicted by continued and not unlrequent re
. m pens of the wanton destruction of homes and the bloody butchery of
â¢â¢â â¢'.' men, women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian
.o â¢ faith. While none oi our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or
'.Â°, . wounded, though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their
:' laiety in the future is by no means assured. Our Government at home
â -.. and our Minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect
â  ." â¢ our missionaries in Ottoman territory, who constitute nearly all the mdi.
-" .' viduals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on the
.â¢â¢ â¢ score of American citizenship.
'â  â¢ Our efforts in this direction will not be relaxed, but the deep feeling
." , and sympathy that have been raised among our people ought not to so far
_ blind their reason and judgment as to lead them to demand impossible
," ' things. The outbreaks oi blind fury which lead to murder and pillage in
, Turkey occur sudden./ and without notice, and an attempt on our part
â¢ â¢ to.force such a hostile presence there as might be effective for prevention
or protection would not only be resisted by the Ottoman Government, but
â¢would be regarded as an interruption of their plans by. the great nations
â who assert their exclusive right to intervene in their own time and method
for the security of life and property in Turkey. Several naval vessels are
â â  stationed in the Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to furnish .
". all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We have made claims
â¢* against the Turkish Government for the pillage" and destruction ot mis-
Monnry property at Harpoot and Murasti during uprisings at these places.
. â  Thus far the validity of these demands has not been admitted, -though our
! * Minister, prior to such outrages and in anticipation of danger, demanded
: â , protection for the persons and property of our missionary citizen* in the
'. ' localities mentioned, and notwithstanding that strong evidence exists of
;- ..'. actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the work ot destruction aid rob
â¢". bery. Tne facts as ihev now appear do not permit, us to doubt the justice
. of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt
.â¢ â¢' settlement. A number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports
; â¢an order has lately been obtained from the Turkish Government permit
. tins; the wives and children of such refugees to join them. here. It Is
-. : ' hoped that hereafter no obstacle will be interposed to prevent the escape
'â¢-. â  -''.of "ail those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish
'..dominions.

â¢â¢. '. charging tne duties of his office, tnough, for some unaccountable reason,
â .his formal exequatur from the Sultan has not b -en issued. 1 do not believe
â¢that the present comber prospect in Turkey will belong permitted tc

: â¢' -.civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century that it
:" .seems hardly possible that (he earnest demand of good people throughout
Â°. . 'â¢ .the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered.
'";'.. THE INSURRECTION IN CUBA.
â¢ : The insurrection in Cuba still continues with all its perplexities.. It
' % Is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward the
pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my
last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds
-' Havana and the seaports and all the considerable towns the insurgents
. still roam at wiil over at least two-thirds of the island country. If the de
â¢ termination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen
with the lapse of time and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of
largely increased military and naval forces to the task there is much
reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers and
character and resources and are none the less inflexible in their resolve
. not to succumb without practically securing the great object forwhicii
they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority
neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an
. independent State. Indeed, as the contest has goii6 on. the pretense that
civil government exists on the island, except so far a.- Spain is able to main
. tain it, has been practically abandoned. ' Spain does keep on foot such
a government, more or less imperfectly, in tne large towns and their im-
. mediate suburbs. But, that exception being made, the entire country is
either given over to anarchy or is subject to the military occupation of
one or the other party. It is reported, indeed, on reliable authority, that at
â  the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent army the putative
Cuban Government has now given up all attempt to exercise its functions,
-.. leaving that Government confessedly (what that is is the best reason for
supposing it always to have bsen in fact) a Government merely on paper.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open or in
pitched battle prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and tne
immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline and,
equipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage.
But they are called upon to face a foe that snuns general engage
ments, that can choose and does choose its own ground, that from the na
ture oi the country is visible or invisible at pleasure, and that fights only
I from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers
: are on its side. In a country where all that is indispensable to life in the
â¢ -. ' way of food, clothing and snelter is so easily obtainable, especially by
those born and bred on the soil, it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to
the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile,
in all cases of protracted civil strife the passions of the combatants grow
more and more Inflamed and excesses on both sides become more frequent
'â¢â  ' and more deplorable. They are also participated in by bands of maraud
ers who, now in the name of one party, now in the name of the other, as
may bast suit the occasion, harass the country at will and plunder its
wretched inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of
things would inevitably entail immense destruction of property, even if it
were the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as practicable. But
while sucn seemed to bo the original policy of the Spanisu Government, it
has now apparently abandoned it and is acting upon the same th ory as
the insurgents, namely, that the exigencies of the contest require the
wholesale annihilation of property thai it may not prove oi any use and
'â¢' , advantage to the enemy. .
It is to the same end that in pursuance of general orders Spanish gar- .
risons are now being withdrawn irorn plantations and the rural popula
tion required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result would
seem to be that the industrial value of the island is last diminishing and
. that unless there is a speedy and ladical change in existing conditions it
â¢ will soon disappear altogether. That value consists very largely, of
â  course, in its capacity to produce sugar, a capacity a. ready much reduced
" by the Interruption to tillage which has taken place during the past two
years. It Is reliably asserted that should these interruption continue
â â¢ during the current year and practical v lend, as is now threatened, to
the entire sugar-producing territory of the island, to much time and so
'' â¢ much money will be required to restore the lard to its normal productive
ness that it is extremely doubtful if capital ran be induced to even make
the attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, in
nature one of the most charming and fertil; on ths whole globe, would
' engage the serious attention oi the Government mid the people of the
Dr.ited States in any circumstances. la point of fact they have a concern
â¢ with it which is by no means of a ho :y sentimental or philanthropical
character. It lies oo near us as to be hardly separated from our territory.
. . Our actual pecuniary. interest in it is second only to tliat of the people
Ban'l Government "> Spain. It is reasonably I mated that at least from
$30,000,000 to $50,000,000 ot American capital arc invested In planta
tion* and in railroad, mining and other business , enterprises on the
island. he volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which
in 1889 amounted to about $34,000,000, rose in 1893 to about $103,000,000,
un<l '" 1894. lie your before tie present in>urret:tlon broke out, amounted
, to nearly $tftÂ».000, 000. Beside* mis large pecuniary stnke In the fur.unes

Â°Â° people of this country always and instinctively feel lor. every struggle for
â¢ better and freer government, and which in thi case of the more ven
turous and restless elements of our population leads in only too many in
stances to active and personal participation in the contest. ;. ..â â .. . - .
The result Is that tnls Government is constantly called upon to protect

Repeats Former Views Relating to the

apologies for the acts of Spanish officials, whose zeal for the repression of
rebellion sometimes blinds them to thÂ« immunities belonging to the un
offending citizen of a friendly power. It foilow< from the same causes that
the United States is compelled to actively poicealong line ot sea coast
nsainst unlawful expeditions, the escape oi which the utmost v.gilniic^
will not always sufflC'.' to prevent, These inevitable entanglements of
the United State* witn the rebellion in Cuba, the large Americnn property
interests affected and considerations of philanthropy and humanity m
general, have led to a vehement demand in various quarters lur some
sort of positive intervention on the pixrt ol the United States.
It was at first proposed that belligerent ripnts should be accorded the
insurgentsâ a proposition no longer weighed, because untimely and in
practical operation perilous and injurious to our own interests, it has
since been and is now f-ometimes contended that the independence of the
insurgents should be recognized; but imperfect and restricted as the Span
ish government of the island m.iy be no other exists thereâ unless the will
of the military officer in temporary command oÂ« a particular district can
be dignified as a species of government. It is now also suggested that the
United States should buy the islandâ a suggestion possibly worthy of con
sideration if there was any evidence of a desire or a willingness on the
part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is urged, finally, that, nil
other methods falling, the existing internecine strife In Cuba should b3
terminated by our intervention even at the (ost of a war between the
United States and Spainâ a wur which its advocates confidently prophesy
could be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful in its issue.
The correctness of this forecast nt-ed be neither affirmed nor denied.
Tt"e United States has nevertheless a character to maintain as a Nation,
which plainly dictates t.iat right and ni>t might should b* the rule of its
conduct. Further, though the United States is not a Nation to wbicu
peace is a necessity, it is, in truth, the most pacific of powers and tie-Ires
nothing Â»o much as to live in amity with all the word. Its own amp. c
and diversified domains satisfy all possible longines for territory, pre
clude all dreams of conquest and prevent any casting of covetous eyes
upon neighboring regions, however attractive. Tnat our conduct toward
Spain and her dominions has constituted no exception to this Naiionrtl
disposition is made manifest by the course of our Government, uot onl.
thus far during the present iimirrect.on, but during tiie ten years that
followed the rising ot Ynra in 1868.
No other great power, it may safely bo said, under circumstances of
similar perplexity wouid have manifested the same restraint and the
same patient endurance. It may also be said that this persistent nttuudo
of the United States toward Spain in connection with Cuba unquestiona
bly evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the
American people. They in truth do not forget ncr connection with the
discovery of the Western Hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the
PRESIDENT GROVER CLEVELAND, Whose Message to Congress Was

neither the Government nor tne people in tne Unite! States have shut
-their eyes to lit- course of events in. Cuba, or have failed to realize the
expense of conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from
the authority of Spainâ grievances recognized by the Queen Regent and
by the Cortes, voiced by the most: pitrlotie mid enlightened of Spanish
statesmen without regard, to party, and demonstrated by reforms pro
posed by the executive and approved by the legislative branch of the
Spanish 'Government. It is "in the assumed temp rand disposition of
the Spanish Government to remedy these grievance-, fortifi. d by indica- .
tions of influential. public opinion ;in Spain, /that this. Government has
. hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of ending the
present strne with honor and adviirUMe* to Spain, and with the achieve
ment of all the reasonable objects of th? insurrection. La .. i . ." .' _ !
. It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomyâ
a measure of home rule which, while preservine the sovereignty of Spain,
would satisfy i all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects â there
.should be no lust reason why tha pacification of the island might, not be
effected on thai basis.. Such a result hi v.d appea-. t > be in the .true in
â¢eroÂ»t of all 'concerned. It would at onre s - op the conflict which is now
consuming the resources of the island and making it worthless for which
â¢ever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep in tnct. the possession*
of Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted rather. t-han
â  lmi-ugurfl by the adequate redress of admitted grievances. It . w<iuld put

: their;capÃCttr.:for' ; i ?c,if-govern,rnent under the most favorable conditions. s
It lifts been Objected' to on' the ; onefide ihnt Spain would -f not promise- â¢'

side, thÂ«t promised autonomy, however liberal-,' is' insufficient, because

".â  -But the reasonableness of the requirement of Spain, of. unconditional
surrender on the part of the niMireuni before their autonomy is
conceded, is not altogether apparent; | It ignores important fenfire* of the 1
situationâ the stability two years' duration thai given to the insurrection ;
the feasibility of its indefinite promulgation, in the nature of things, and
as shown by past experiences; the ir and imminent ruin of the island,
unless the" present strife l.Â» gpeedilr terminated; J above all, the rank
abuses which all parties in Spain, all branches of her government and all
leading public men concede to exist and profess a desire to remove.
PATIENCE WITH SPAIN MAY CEASE.
Facing such circumstances, to withhold the proffer of needed re
forms until the parties demanding them put themselves at
mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance of
neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as
to the sincerity of any professed willingness to grant reforms.
The objection on behalf of the insurgentsâ that promised re
forms cannot be relied uponâ must of course be considered, though we
have no right to assume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain
undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done according to both
the spirit and the letter of the undertaking. Nevertheless, realizing that
suspicions ana persecutions on the part of the weaker of the two com
batants are always natural and not always unjustifiable â being sincerely
desirous in the interest of both, as well as on its own account, that the
Cuban problem should be solved with the least possible delayâ it was in
timated by this Government to the Government of Spain some months
aÂ«o that if satisfactory measures of home rule were tendered the Cubau in
surgents and would be accepted by them upon a guarantee of its ex
ecution, tne United States would endeavor to find a way not objectionable
to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. While no dpfinite response to this
intimation has yet been received from the Spanish Government, it is be
lieved to be not altogether unwelcome, while, as already suggested, no
reason is perceived why it should- not be approved by the insurgents.
Neither party can fatl to see the importance of early action, and both must
realize that to prolong the present state of things for even a short period
will add enormously to the time and labor and expenditure necessary to
bring about the industrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fer
vently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach
beiween Spain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated
may be at once inaugurated and pushed to an immediate and sucessful
issue. The friendly c fficeÂ» of the United States, either in the manner
above outlined or in any other way consistent wituour constitution and
laws, will always be at the disposal of either par:y.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interest would
constrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or an interference
with its control by any other power. It should be added that it cannot bo
reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United
Stntes will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord
all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending
conflict in all its features, and properly apprehend our inevitably close
relations to it and its possible results, without considering that by tha
course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprece
dented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spniu to
end the contest, either alone and in her own way or with our lriendly
co-operation.
When the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurgents
has become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is ex
tinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hope
lei-s struggle for its re-establishment has degenerated into a strife whicn
means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of hum.-in life and the
utter "ieslruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, asituotion
will b3 presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain
will be superseded by higher obligations which we can hardly hesitate
to recognize and discharge. Deferring tho choice of ways and methods
until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend upon the
precise conditions then existing, and they should not be determined upon
without giving careful heed to every consideration involving our honor
and interest or the international duty we owe to Spain. When we face
the contingencies suggested or the situation is by otiier incidents impera
tively changed, we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pur
sued, thus in ail circumstances exhibiting our obedience to the require
ments of public law ai:d our regard for the duty enjoined upou us by the
position we occupy in tno family of nations.
A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead
us to avoid their creation either tnrou^h a careless disregard of present
duty or tven au undue stimulation and ill-timed expression of feeling.
But 1 have deemed it noi remiss to remind the Congress that a time may
arrive when a correct policy and care for our interest;, as well as a regard
for the interests of other nations and their citizens, joined by consider
ations of humanity, and a desire to see a rich and fertile country, inti
mately related to us, saved from complete devastation, will constrain our
Gc/vernment to such action as will subserve the interests thus involved
and ft the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity
to enjoy the blessings of peace.
VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY QUESTION.
The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matier of dif
ference between Great Britain and the United States, their respective
Governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty
between Great Britain and Venezuela, submitting the whole controversy
to arbitration. The provisions of the treaty are so eminently just and
fair tnal the assent of Venezuela thereto mny confidently be anticpated.
Negotiations lor a treaty of general arbitration for nil differences be
tween Great BritAin and the United States are far advanced and promi*d
to reach a successful conclusion at an early date.
REFORM IN THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
The scheme of examining the applicants for certain consular positions
to test their competency and fitness, adopted under an executive order is
sued on the 20th oi September. 1895, U*a fully demonstrated tho useful*
ness of this innovation. In connection with this plan of examination
promoiioDs and transfers of deserving incumbents have been quite exten
sively n:a."le with excellent results. During the past year thir:y-five ap
poinimenis have been made in the consular service, twenty-seven of
whicn were made to fill vacancies causod by death or resignation or to
supply newly crented posis, two to succeed incumbents removed for cause,
two for ifce purpose of displacing alk-n consular officials by American citi
zens and lour merely cnauvirur the official title of incumbent from com
meruinl areit to Consul. Twelve oi the appointments were transfers or
promotions from other positions under the Department of ritate, four of
those appointed had rendered previous service under the department
and eight were made of persons who passed a satisfactory examination.
Seven were appointed to places uot included in the order of Septem
ber 20, 1895, and four appointments, as above stated, involved no change
of incumbency. The inspection of consular officers provided lor by an ap
propriation or that purpose ai the last session of the Congress has been
productive oi such wholesome effects that I hope this important work will
in the future be continued. I know of nothing that can be done with same
slight expense so improving to the service.
OFFICIAL RESIDENCES FOR EMBASSADORS.
I desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual
message In favor of providing at public expense official residences for our
Embtissadors and Ministers at foreign capitals. The reasons supporting
this recommendation are strongly stated in the report of the Secretary of
State, and the subject seems of such importance that I hope it may receive
tne early attention of Congress.
PROTECTION OF BERING SEA SEALS.
We have during the last yenr labored faithfully and against unfavor
able conditions to secure better preservation of seal life in the Bering Sea.
Both thcUuited States and Great Britain have lately dispatched Commissio
ners to these waters to study the habits and conditions of the sea! herd and
the causes of their rapd decrease. Upon the reports of these Commission
era, soon to be submitted, and with the exercise of patience and good sense
on the partoi ah interested parties, it is earnestly hoped that hearty co
operaHon may be iecured for the protection against threatened extinction
of teal life in the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.
FEDERAL RECEIPTS AND EXPENSES.
The Secretary of the Treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 189G, the receipts of the Government from all sources amounted
to $409,475,408 78. During the same period its* expenditures were
$434,678, 054 48, the excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounting
to $'2~>, 203, 245 70. The ordinary expenditures during the year wero
$4,015,852 31 less than during the precedine fiscal year. Of the receipts
mentioned there was derived from customs the sum of $180,021,751 67
aTd from internal revenue $14tÂ».830,615 60. The receipts from customs
show au increase of $7,0t>3,134 22 over those from the same source for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, and the receipts from internal revenue an
increase of $3,584,537 61. Thu value of our imported dutiab c merchan
dise during the Ust fiscal year was $369. 757, 770 and the value of free
goods imported $409,967,470, being an increase of $6,523,675 in the value
of dutiable goods and $41,231,034 in the value of free goods over the pre
ceding year. Our exports of merchandise, foreign and domestic, amounted
in valui- to $882, (506, 938, being an increase over the preceding year ol
$75,068 773. Tne average Â«d valorem duty paid on dutiable goods ira
por ed during the year was 39.94 per cent and on free and dutiable goods
taken together 20.55 per cent.
The cost of collecting our internal revenue was 2.78 per cent, as
against 2.81 per cent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895. The total
production of distilled spirits, exclusive of fruit brandies, v.-hs 88,583,703

year. There was also an increasa of 1,443,676 gailnns of spirits produced
from fruit, as compared with the preceding yen. Tne number of barrels
of b<>er produced was 35,809,250, against 33.58!Â»,784 produced in the pre
ceding fiscal year, being an increase of 3,269,446 barrels.
PRODUCTION AND COINAGE OF METALS.
The total amount of gold exported during the last fiscal year was
$112,409,947, and of silver $60,541,670, being an increase of $45,941,466
of gold and $13,246,384 of silver over the exportations of the preceding
fiscal year. The imports of cold were $33,525,065 and of silver $28,777,
-186, being $2,859,695 less of gold and $8,566,007 moro of silver than dur
ing the preceding year. The total stock of metallic money in the United
States at the close "i the last fiscal year en<led on the 30th day of .June,
1896. was $1,228,326,035, of which $599,597,90-l was in gold and $028,
-728,071 in silver.
On the Ist day of November. 1896, the total stock of money of all kinds
in the country was $2,285,410,590, and the amount in circulation i.ot in
cluding that in the treasury noldings was $1,628 055,641, being $22 (J3
per capita upon au estimated population of 71,902.000. The production
of thÂ» precious metals in the United States during the calendar year 1895
is estimated to hayÂ« h"en 2.254,760 fine ounces of gold, of the value of
$46 610.000. and 55,727,000 ii ne ounces of silver, of the commercial value

The tr.tiil coinaare at the mints of the Uni'el States during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1896, amounted to $72,138,468 52. The number of
National hanks organized irom the time the law authorizing 1 1 . e i r creation
was pttssed, up to Ociober 31, 1896. was 5957 and of this number 3679 were
at the date last mentioned in active operation, having authorzed capital
stock of $656,014,895 he'd by 283.703 shareholders, and circulating
notes amounting t0 521,413,030.
NATIONAL BANK NOTE CIRCULATION.
The total outstanding circulating notes of all National banks on the
81st day of October, 1596, amounted to $234,553,107, including unre
deemed but fully secured notes of banks insolvent and in process of liqui
dation. The increase in National bank circulation during the yearending
on that day was $21,099,429. On October 6, 1896. when the condition of
National banks was last reported, the total resources of the 3679 active in
stitutions was $3,203,695,313. which included $1,893,268,839 31 in loans

AN INCREASED IMMIGRATION.
The number of immigrants arrived in the United States during the
flsoftl year was 343,267, oi whom 340,463 were permitted to land and
27'J;) were debarred on various grounds prescribed by law and returned
to the countries whence they Tame at the expense of the steamship com
pany by which they were brought in. The increase in immigration over
the preceding year amounted to 84,131. It is reported that, with some
exceptions, the immigrants of the past year were of a hardy laboring
class, accustomed and able to earn a support for themselves, and it is
estimated that the money brought with them amounts to at least
$5,000,000, though it was probably much in excess of that sum, since
only those having le.-s tlmns3o are required to disclose the exact amount,
and' it is known that many brought considerable sums of money to buy
land and build hornet Including all th-j immigrants arriving who were
over 14 years of age, 28.03 per c,nt were illiterate, as against 20.27 per
cent of those of ttm fye arr:v.ng during the preceding fiscal year. The
number of immigrants over 14 years old, the countries from whlcn they
enme and the percentage ot illiterates amonir thorn were as follows:
Italy, 57.515. with 54.59 per cent; Ireland, 37,496. with 7 per cent;
Ku-sih, 35,188. with 41.14 per cent; Austria-Hungary and provinces,
57,053, with 38 92 per cent; Germany, 25,334, with 2.96 percent;
bweden, 18.821, with 1.16 per cent, while from Portugal there came 206/,
o! whom 77.69 per cent were illiterate. There arrived from Japan during
the year only- 1110 immigrants, and It is the opinion of the immigration
authorities that the apprehension heretofore existing to some extent of
a large immigration from Japan to the United States is without any sub
stautial foundation.
REPORTED BY THE LIFE-SAVERS.
From the life-saving service it is reported that the number of disasters
to documented vessels within the limits of its operatious during the year
was 437. These vessels had on board 4608 persons, of whom 4595 were
saved and 13 lost. The value of such vessels is estimated at $8,830,140,
and of their cargoes $3,946,380, making tho total value of property im
periled 912,726,520 Of this amount $11,292,707 was save I and
$1,432,750 wa-. lot. S .Uy-seven of the vesMUi were totally wrecked.
There were besides 243 casualties to small undocumented craft, on buard
of which there were 094 persons, of whom 587 were saved and 7 lost The
value of the property involved in these latter casualties is estimated at
$119,::tJ5, of which $114,915 was saved and $4350 was lost. Tne iife
saving crews durmg the year aiso rescued or assi>ted numerous other
vessels and warned many from danger by signals coth by day and night.
Ihe number of disasters during the year exceeded that of any previous
year in tiie history of the service; but me saving of both life aud property
"was greater than ever beiore in proportion to the value of the property
involved aud to the number of persons imperiled.
MARINE, NAVAL AND MILITARY SERVICE.
The operations of the marine hospital service, the revenue cutter
service, the steamboat inspection service, the lighthouse service, the
bureau of navigation and other branches oi public work attached to the
Treasury Department, together with various recommendations concern
ing their support and improvement aru fully stated in the report of the
Secretary to which the attention of the Congress is especially invited.
The report of the Secretary of War exhibits satisfactory conditions in the
several branches of the public service intrusted to his charge
The limit of our military force as fixed bylaw is constantly and readily
maintained. T.'ie present di^c;pline and morale of our army are excellent
and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout its entire
organization! With the exception of delicate duties in the suppression
of slight Indian disturbances alongour southwestern boundary, in which
tha Mexican troops co-operated, and the compulsory but peaceful return,
with the consent ol Great Britain, oi a baud of Cree Indians from Montana
to the British possessions, no active operations have been required of the
army during tae year past. Changes in methods of administration, the
abandonment of unnecessary posts and consequent concentration of
troops and the exercise of care and vigilance by the various officers charged
with the responsibility, in the expenditure of the appropriations, have re
sulted in reducing to a minimum ttie co^t of maintenance of our military
establishment. During the past year the work of constructing permanent
infautry and cavalry posts has been continued at the places heretolore
designated.
The Secretary of War repeats his recommendation that appropriations
for barracks and quarters should more strictly conform to the need of the
s rvice m> judged by the department ratner than respond to the wishes
and importuuities of localities. It is imperative that much oi the
money provided for such coustruction should now be allotted to the erec
tion of necessary quarters for tne garrisons assigned to the coast de
fenses, where many men will be needed toprjperiy care for and operate
modern guns. It is essential, too, that early provision be mada to supply
the necessary force ot artillery to meet the demands of this service. Tho
entire armyhas now been equipped with the new magazine arms, and
Wise policy demands thai all available public and private resources should
be so employed as to provide, within reasonable time, a sufficient number
to supply the State militia with these modern weapons aud provide an
ample reserve for any emergency.
Xh'i organized militia number 112,379 men. The appropriations for
its support by the several States approximate $2,800,000 annually, and
$400,000 is contributed by the Gtfiier al Government. Investigation shows
thisc troops to be usually drilled and inspired with much military interest,
but, in many instances, they are sodencient in proper arms and eouip
meul that a sudden call to active duty would find them inadequately pre
pared for field service. 1, therefore, recommend that prompt measures be
taken to remedy this condition, and that every encouragement be given
to tnis de--ervi.ig body ot unpaid and voluntary citizen soldiers, upon
whose assistance we must largely rely in time of trouble.
PROTECTION OF THE SEA COASTS.
During the past year rapid progess has been made toward the com
pletion of the scheme adopted for the protection aud armament oi fortifi
cations along our sea coast, while equal progress has been made in provid-
, ing the material for submarine defense in connection with these works.
It is peculiarly gratifying at this time to note the great advance that has
been lnnde in this important undertaking since the date of my annual
message to the Fifty -third Congress at the opening oi its second session,
in December, 1893. At that time I informed the Congress of the approach
ing completion of nine 12-inch, twenty 10-inch and thirty-four 8-inch
high-power steel guns and seventy-five 13-inch rifled mortars. This total
then seemed insignificant when compared with the great work remain
ing to be done. Yet it was none the ;ess a source of satisfaction to every
citizen when he reflected that it represented the first installment of the
new ordnance oi American design and American manufactures, and de
monstrated our ability to supply from our own resources guns of unex
celled power and accuracy. At that date, however, there were practically
no carriages upon which to mouut these guns, and only 31 emplacements
for guvs and 04 for mortars. N>>r were all these emplacements in condi
tion to receive thtir armament. Only one high-power gun was in that
time In position for the defense oi the entire coast.
Since that time the number ot guns actually completed has been in
creased to twenty-one 12-;uch, fifty-six 10-inch, sixty-one 8-inch high
power breech-loading steel, ten rapid-fire guns and eighty 12-inch rifled
mortars, in addition there are in piocess ot construction one 16-inch
type-gun, fifty 12-inch, fifty-six. 10-inch, twenty -seven 8-inch high-power
guns and sixty-six 12-inch rifled mortars, in all 428 guns and mortars.
During the same year, immediately preceding the message referred to,
the Brat modern gun-carriage had been completed, and eleven more were
in process of construction.
Al. but oue were of the non-disappearing type. These, however, were
not such as to secure necessary cover for the artillery gunners against the
intense tire of modern machine rapid-fire and high-power guns. The in
ventive genius of ordnance aud civilian experts has been taxed in design
ing carriages that would obviate this fault, resulting, it is believed, in the
solution of this difficult problem. Since 1803 the numb tof gun-carriages
constructed or building has been raised to a total ot 139, of which thirty
are on the disappearing principle, and the number of mortar-carriages to
153, while the ninety-five emplacements which were provided for prior to
that time have been "increased to 230, built and building.
Tins improved situation is largely due to the recent generous response
of Congress to the recommendations of the War Department. Thus we
we shall soon have completed about one-fifth of the comprehensive sys
tem, the first step in which was noted in my message to the Congressof
December 4, 1893. When It is understood that a masonry emplacement
not only furnishes a platform for the heavy modern high-power gun, but
also in every particular serves the purpose and takes the place of the fort
of former days, the lmvortance ot the work accomplished is better com
prehended, in the hope that the work will be prosecuted with no less
vigor in the future, the Secretary of War has submitted an estimate by
which, If allowed, there will ba provided and either built or building by
the end of the next fiscal year such additional guns, mortars, gun-car
riages. and emplacements as will represeut not far from one-third of the
totnl work to be cone under the plan adopted for our coast defenses, thus
affording a prospecfc that the shore work will be substantially completed
within six years. In less time than that, however, we shail have attained
a marked d^ree ol security.
The experience and results of the past year demonstrate that with a
continuation, of present careful methods the cost of remaining work will
be much less than the original estimate. We should always keep in mind
that of all forms of military preparation coast defense alone is essentially
pacific in its nature. While it gives tae seuseof security due to a con
bCiousne'S of strength it is neither the pu-pose nor the effect oi such per
manent fortification to involve us in foreign complications, but rather to
guarantee us against them. They are not a temptation to war, but rather
security against it. Tnus they are thoroughly in accord with all the tra
ditions oi our National diplomacy.
WORK OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.
The Attorney-General presents us a detailed aud interesting state
ment of the impoTtant work done under his supervision during the last
fiscal year. The ownership and management by the Government of peni
tentiuries for the confinement of those convicted in the United States
courts of violation of Federal laws, which for many years has been a sub
ject of executive recommendation, has at last to a slight extent been real
ized by tlje nti izaton of tne abandoned military prison at Fort Leaven
worth as a United States penitentiary. This is" certainly a move in the
right direction, but it ought to be at once supplemented by the rebuilding
or the extensive enlargement of this improvised prison, and the construc
tion of at ieast one more, to be located in the Southern States. The ca
pacity of the Leavenworth penitentiary Is so limited that the expense of
its maintenance, calculated at a per capita rate upon the number of pris
oners it can accommodate, does not nake as economical an exhibit as if
it wt'ro larger nnd better adapted to prison purposes; but I am thor
oughly convinced that economy and humanity an i a proper sense of
responsibility and duty toward those whom we punish for violations of
Federal law dictate that the Federal Government should hnve the entire
control and manaKement^oi the pun i ten tinries where convicted violators are
confined. It appears tiiai since the transfer of the Fort Lenvenworth mili
tury prison to its now uses the work previously done by prisoners confined
there nnd for which expensivf machinery has been provided has been dis
continued. This work consisted oi the manufacture of articles for army use
now done elsewhere. On all grounds it is exceedingly desirable that the
convicts confined in this penitentiary \>e al;owed to resume work of this
description. It is most gratifying 10 note the satisfactory results that have
loiiowod the inauguration of the system provided for by the act of May
28, 1806, under which certain Federal officials arc compensated by salary
instead of fees. The new plan was put In operation on the Ist day of
July, 189b'. and already the great economy it enforced, its prevention oi
abuses and Hi tendency to a better enforcement of the laws ore strik
ingly apparent. Detailed evidence of the usefulness oi this long-delayed
and now happily accomplished retorm will be found clearly set forth in
the Attorney-General's report.
POSTAL REFORMS ARE URGED.
Our Postoffice Department is in good condition, and the exhibit made
of its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, if allowance
is made lor imperfections In the laws applicable to it, is very satisfactory.
The total receipts during the year were $82,499,208 40. The total ex
penditures were $90.026.256 84, exclusive ot $1,559,898 27, which was
earned by the Paritic railroads lor transportation and credited on their debt
to the Government. Tuerewasan increase of receipts over the previous
year of $3,516,808 21, or 7.1 per cent, and an increase at expenditures of
$3,836,124 02. or 442 percent. The deficit was $1,679,950 19 less than
that of the preceding year. The chief expenditures of tin- postal service
are regulated by law and are not in the control of the Postmaster-General.
All that'he can accomplish by the most watchful administration and econ
omy is to enforce prompt. and thorough collection -.and accounting for
public moneys hik. such minor savings in smnll expenditures and in
letting those contracts :or postofflce supplies and star service which are
not regulated by statute. An effective co-operation between the Auditor's
office and the PosiofÃce Department and tbv making and enforcement of
orders by the department requiring immediate notification to their
sureties of any delinquencies on the part of > postmasters and compelling
such postmasters .to make' more frequent deposits oi 'postal funds have
resulted in a prompter auditing of their accounts and much less default to

railway mail service. With increased postal facilities much higher accu
racy in handling mails has also been reamed, as appears by the decrease
of errors in the railway mail service and the reduction of mail matter
returned to the Dead-letter Office. The deficit for the last year, although
much lcÂ«s than that of the lust and preceding yeurs, emphasizes the neces
sity for legislation to correct the growing abuse of second-class rates, to
which the deficiency is mainly attributable. The transmission at the rate
of 1 cent a pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets, '-house organs"
(periodicals advertising some particular "houge" or institution), sample
copies and the like ought certainly to be discontinued. A glance at the
revenues received for the work done last year will show more plainly than
any other statement the gross abuse of the postal service and the growing
waste oi Us earnings. The free matter carried in the mails for the depart
ment, offices etc , of the Government and for Congress in pounds amounted
to 94.480, 189.
Ji this is offset against buildings for postoffices and stations, the rental
of which would more than compensate for such free postal service, we
have this exhibit: Weight ot mail matter (other than above) transmitted

The remainder of our postal revenue, amounting to something more
than $5,000,000, was derived from box rents register fees, money-order
business und other similar items. Toe entire expenditures of the depart
ment, including pay for transportation credited to the Pacific railroads,
was $92,180,195 11, which may be considered as the cost of receiving,
carrying and delivering the above mail matter. It thus appears that
though the second-class matter constituted more than two-thirds of the
total that was carried, the revenue derived from it was less than one
thirtieth of the total expanse.
The average revenue from each pound of first-class matter was 9.3
cents; from each pound of second c.asÂ«, B}4 mills (of the second claÂ«s
62,348,297 was county free matter); from eucn pound of third class, 13.1
cents; tioui each pound of fourtn class, 15.0 tents. The growth o: weight
of second-class matter has been from 299,000,000 pounds in 1894 to 318,
-000,000 in 1895 and 10 almost 349,000,000 in 1896, and it is quite evident
that this incrchsing drawback is mr outstripping auy possible growth of
postal revenues.
Our mail service- should, of course, be such as to meet the wants and
even the conveniences of our people at a direct charge upon them so lignt
as perhaps to exclude the idea of our Postoffioe Department being a money
making concern, but in the tace of a constantly reuurring deficiency in its
revenues, and in view of the fact that we supply the best mail service in
the world, it seems to me it is quite time to correct the abuses that swell
enormously our annual deficit, n we concede the public policy of carrying
weekly newspapers free in the county of publication, and even the policy
of carrying at less than one-tenth of their cost. Other tiian bona-flde
newspapers and periodicals, there can be no excuse for subjecting the
service to the further immerse and increas ng loss involved iv carrying at
the nominal rate of 1 cent a pound Hie serial Cranes, sometimes includ
ing trashy and even harmful literature and other matter, which under the
loose interpretation of a loose statute has been gradually given second
class ntUs, thusatiiorbing all profitable returns derived from first class
matter, which pnys three or four times more than its cost, aud producing
a iarge annual l.ss to be paid by general taxation.
It such second class matter paid merely the cost of its handling our
deficit would soon disappear and a surplus result, which might be used to
give the people still better mail labilities or a cheaper rate of letter
postage. I recommend that legislation be. at once enacted to correct these
abuses and introduce letter Dusir.ess Ideas in tne regulation oi our po.-tal
rates. Experience and observation have demonstrated that certain im
provements in the organization of the Postoffice Department must be
secured before we can gain the full benefit of thu immense sums expended
in its administration. This involves the following reforms, which I earn
estly recommend :
There should be a small addition to the inspector service to be em
ployed in the supervision of the carrier force, which now numbers 13,000
men and performs its service practically without the surveillance exer
cised over all other branches of the postal or public service. Of course
such a lack oLjoine supervision and freedom from wholesome disciplinary
restraints must inevitably lead to imperfect service. There should also be
appointed a lew inspectors who could assist the central offices in neces
sary investigation concerning matters of postoffice. leases, post-office sites,
allowances for rent, fuel and lights, and in organizing and securing the
best results from the wort oi the 14,000 clerks now employed in first and
second class offices. lam convinced that the small expense attending
the inauguration of these reforms would actually be a profitable invest
ment. 1 especially recommend such a recasting of the appropriations by
Congress for the Potoffice Department as will permit the Poiumaster-Gen
erai to proceed with the work of consolidating postoflices. This work has
already oeen entered upon sufficiently to Hilly demonstrate by experi
ment and experience that such consolidation is productive of better serv
ice, larger revenues and less expenditures, to say nothing of the further
advantage of gradually withdrawing postoffices from the spoils system.
UNIVERSAL POSTAL UNION CONGRESS.
The universal postal union which now embraces all the civilized
world and whose delegates will represent 1,000,000,000 people, will hold its
fifth congress in the city of Washington in May, 1897. The United States
may be said to have taken the initiative which led to the first meeting of
this congress in Berne in 1874, and the formation of the Universal Postal
Union, which brings the postal service of all countries to every man's
neighborhood and has wrought marvels in cheapening postal rates and
securiuÃ absolutely safe mail communication throughout the world. Pre
vious congresses have met in Berne, Paris, Lisbon and Viennn, and the
respective countries in which they have assembled have made generous
provision lor their accommodation and for the reception and entertain
ment oi the delegates. In view of the importance of this assemblage and
of its deliberations and of the honors and hospitalities accorded to our
representatives by other countries on similar occasions I earnestly hope
that such an appropriation will be made for the expenses necessarily at
tendant upon ttie coming meeting in our caiital city as will be worthy of
our National hospitulity, and indicative oi our appreciation of the event.
CONSTRUCTION OF MODERN WARSHIPS.
The work of the Navy Department, and its present condition, are fully
exhibited in the report of the Secretary. The construction of vessels for
our new navy has been energetically prosecuted by the present admin
istration upon the general lines previously adopted, the department
having seen no necessity tor radical changes in prior methods under
which the work was found to be progressing in c manner highly satisfac
tory. It has been decided, however, to provide in every ship-building
contract that the builder should pay all trial expensts, and it has also
been determined to pay no speed premiums in future contracts. The
premiums recently earned and some yet to be decided are features of the
made before this conclusion was readied.
W On March 4, 1893, there were in -commission but two armorei vessels,
the double-turreted monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since that
dale, of vesse.s theretofore authorized, there have been placed in com
mission three first-class and two secoud-cla-s battle-ships, two armored
cruisers, one harbor defense ram, and five double-turreted monitors, in
cluding the Maine and the Puritan, just comDleted. Eight new un
armored cruisers and two new gunboats have also been commissioned.
The lowa, another battle-ship, will be completed about March 1. and at
least four more gunboats will be ready for sea in the early spring. It is
gratifying to state that our ships and their outfits are believed to be equal
to the best that can be manufactured elsewhere, and that such notable
reductions have Won made in their cost as to justify the statement that
quite a number of vessels are now being constructed at rates as low as
those that prevail in European shipyards.
Our manufacturing facilities are at this time ample for all possible
naval contingencies, Three of our Government navy-yards, those at
Mare Island, Cal., Norfolk, Va., and Brooklyn, N. V., are equipped for
6hip-building, our ordnance plant in Washington is equal to any in the
â world, and at the torpedo station we are successfully making the highest
grades of smokeless powder. Three first-class private shipyards, at New
port News, Philadelphia and San Francisco, are building battle-ships;
eleven contractors, situated in the States of Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsyl
vania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and the State of Washington, are
constructing gunboats or torpedo-boats.
Two plants are manufacturing large quantities of first-class armor
and American factories are producing automobile torpedoes, powder,
projectiles, rapid-fire guns and everything else necessary for the com
plete outfit of naval vessels. There have been authorized Dy Congress
since March, 1893, five battle-ships, six light draft gunboats, sixteen tor
pedo-boats and the submarine torpedo-boat. Contracts for the building of
all these have been let. The Secretary expressed the opinion that we
have for the present a sufficient supply of cruisers and gunboats and that
hereafter the construction of battle-ships and torpedo-boats will supply
our needs.
Much attention has been given to the methods of carrying on depart
mental business. Important modifications in the regulations have been
made tending to unify tne control of ship-building, as far as may be,
under the bureau of construction and repairs, and also to improve the
mode of purchasing supplies for the navy by the bureau of supp ies and
accounts. The establishment under recent acts of Congress of a supply
fund, with which to purchase these supplies in large quantities, and
other modifications of methods, have tended materially to their cheapen
ing nnd better quality.
The War College has developed into an institution which, it is be
lieved, will be Of great value to thÂ» navy in teaching the science of war
as well as in stimulating professional zeal in the navy, and it will bo
especially useful in the devisinc of plans for the utilization, in case of
necessity, of all the naval resources of the United States. The Secretary
has persistently adhered to the plan he found in operation lor securing
lat)Or at the navy-yards through boards of labor employment and has
done much to make it more competep etc and efficient. The naval officers
who are familiar with this system and its operation express the decided
opinion that its results have been to vÂ«sily improve the character of the
work done at our yards and greatly reduce its cost. Discipline among
officers and men of the navy has been maintained to a high standard and
tne percentage of American citizens has been very much increased. The
Secretary is considering, and wi.l formulate during the coming winter, a
plan forlaying up ships in reserve, thereby largely reducing the cost of
maintaining our vessels afloat.
This plan contemplates that battle-ship?, torpedo-boats and such of the
cruisers as are not needed for active service at sea shall be kept in re
serve, with skeleton crews on board, to keep them in condition, cruising
only enough to insure the efficiency of the ships and their crews in time
ot activity. The economy to result from this system is too obvious to
need comment. The naval militia, which was authorized a few years ago
as an experiment, has now developed into a body of enterprising young
men, active and energetic in the discharge of their duties and promising
great usefulness. This establishment has nearly the same relations to
our navy as the National Guard in the different States bears to'our army
and it constitutes a source of supply for our naval forces, the importance
of which is immediate y apparent. The report of the Secretary of the
Interior presents a comprehensive ana interesiing exhibit of the numer
ous and important affairs committed to his supervision. It is impossible
in this communication to do more than briefly reier to a lew of the sub
jects concerning which the Secretary give? full and instructive iufor
mation.
PUBLIC LANDS SHOULD BE GUARDED.
The money appropriated on account of this department for Its dis
bursement for the fiscal year ended June 30. 1890, amounted to more
than $157,000,000, or a greater sum than was appropriated lor the entire
maintenance of the Government for the two fiscal years ended June 30,
1861. Our public lands, originally amounting to 1.840,000,000 acres'
has been so reduced that only about 600.000,000 acres still remain in
Government control, excluding Alaska. The balance, being by far the
most vh: uable portion, has Open given away to settlers, to new States and
to railroads or soid Â«t a comparatively nominal sum.
The patenting ot land in execution of railroad grants has progressed
rapidly during this year, aad since the lourth day of Marcii, 1893, about
25.000,000 acres have thus been conveyed to those corporations. I
agree with the Secretary tiiat the remainder of our public lauds should
be more carefuliy dealt with and their alien. .tion guarded by better
economy and greater prudence. The commission appointed from the mem
bership of the National Ac.idemy of Sciences, provided for byhna^tof
Congress, to formulate plans for a National forestry sy*tera will, it is
hoped, soon be prepared to present the result of thorough and intelligent
examination of this important subject.
IMPROVEMENT OF THE INDIANS.
The total Indian population of the United States is 177,235, according
to a census iv 1895. exclusive of those within the State of New York and
those comprising the five civilized tribes. Of this number theie are ap
proximately 38,000 children of school pge. During the year 23,398 of
these wf.Te enrolled in schools. The progress which has attended recent
efforts to extend Indian echool facilities and the anticipation of continued
liberal appropriations to that end, cannot fail to afford the utmost satis
faction to those uho believe that the education of Indian children is a
prime factor in the accomplishment of Indian civilization. It maybe
said in general terms that in every particular the improvement of the
Indians under srovernment has been most marked nnd encoumging. The
Comriiissioiiei oi Indian Affairs and the agents haviuK charge of Indians"
to whom allotments lmve been made, strongly urge toe passage of a
law prohibiting the *B.\e of liquor to alloaees who bnve tuifen their
lands in severally. I earnestly join in this reeoinmeudation, and venture
to express the hnpc that the Indian may be speedily protected against this
one greatest of ail evils to his wjil-being and advancement.
The condition of affairs among the live civilized tribes, who occupy
large tracts of land in the Indian Territory, and who have governments
of their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost indispens
able that there should bean entire change in the relations of these Indians
to the General Government. This seems to be necessary in furtherance of
thesr own interests as well as for the protection oi non-Indiar. residents in
their territory. A commission organized and empowered under several
recent laws is now negotiating with these Indians for the relinquishment
of their courts and the division of their common lands in severally, ana
are aiding in the settlement of the troublesome question of tribal mem
bership. The reception of their first proffers of negotiations whs not en
couraging, but through patience and such conduct ou their part as dem
onstrated that their Intentions were friendly and in the interest oi the
tribes, the prospect of success has become more promising. Tho effort
should be to save these ladians from the consequences of their own mis
takes and improvidence and to secure to the real Indian his rights as
against intruders and prof jssed friends who profit by his retrogression.
A change is also ueeded to protect life and property through the
operation of courts conducted according to strict justice and strong
enough to enforce their mandates. As a sincere friend of the Indian, I
am exceedingly anxious that these retorms shou'd be accomplished with
the consent and aid of the tribes and tuat no necessity may be presented
for radical or drastic legislation. I hope, therefore, that the commission
now conducting negotiations will soon be able to report that progress has
been nuide toward a friendly adjustment of existing difficulties.
It appears that a very valuable deposit of silsonite or asphaltum has
been found on the reservation in Utah, occupied by the Uncompagre In
dians. Every consideration of care for the public interest and every sen
sible business reason dictate such management or disposal of this impor
tant source of public revenue as will except it from tne general rules and
incidents attending the ordinary disposition of public lauds and secure
to the Government a iair share at least ot its advantages iv place of its
transfer for a nominal sum to interested individuals.
I indorse the recommendation made by the present Secretary of the
Interior as well as his predecessor that Â» permanent commission consist
ing of three members, one of whom shall be un anuy officer, be created to
perform the duties now devolving upon the Commissioner and Assistant
Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The management of the bureau involves
such numerous and diverge details and the. advantages of an uninter
rupted policy are so apparent that I hope tne change suggested will meet
the approval of the Congress.
DIMINUTION OF THE PENSION ROLL.
The diminution of our enormous pension roll aud the decrease of pen
sion expenditures, which has been so often confidently foretold, still fail
in material realization. The number of pensioners on the roils at the
Close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896. was 970,678. This is the
largst number ever reported. The amount paid exclusively for the pen
sions during the year was $138,214,761 94, a slight decrease from that of
the preceeding year, while the total expenditures on account of pensions,
including the cost of maintaining the denartirfent and expenses attending
the pension distributions amounted to $143,206,550 59 or within avery
small fraction of one-third of the entire expense of supporting the Govern
ment during the same year. The number of new pension certificates
issued was 90,649. Of these 40,374 represent original allowances of
claims and 15,678 increase of existing pensions. The number of persons
receiving psn*ioua from the United States., but residing in ioreign coun
tries at the close of the last fiscal year, was 3731, and the amount paid to
them during the year was $532,735 38. The sum appropriated lor the
payment of pensions for the current lineal year ending June 30, 1897, is
$140,000,000 and ior the succeeding year it is estimated that the same
amount will be necessary.
The Commissioner of Pensions reports that during the last fiscal year
339 indictments were found against violators of the pension laws. Upon
these indictments 167 convictions resulted. In my opinion, based upon
such statements as these and much other information and observation,
the abuses which have been allowed to creep into our pensions have done
incalculable harm in demoralizing our people and undermining good
citizenship. I have endeavored within my sphere of official duty to pro
tect our pension and make it what it should be, a roil ot honor, contain
ing the names of those disabled in their country's service and worthy of
their country's affectionate remembrance. When I have seen those who
pose as the soldiers' friends active and alert in urging gieater laxity and
more reckiess pension expenditures, while nursing selfish schemes, I have
deprecated the approach of a situation when necessary retrenchment and
enforced economy may lead to an attack upon pension abus.-s so deter
mined as to overlook the discrimination due to those who, worthy of a
Nation's care, ought to live aud die under the protection of a Nation's
gratitude.
DEBTS OF PACIFIC RAILROADS DUE.
The Secretary calls attention to the public interests involved in an ad
justment of the obligation of the Pacific railroads to the Government. I
deem it to be an important duty to especially present this subject to the
consideration of the Congress. On January 1, 1897, with the amount
already matured more than $13,000,000 of the principal of the subsidy
bonds issued by the United States in aid of the construction of tne Union
Pacific Railway, including its Kansas line, and more than $6, 000,000 of
like bonds issued in aid of the Central Pacific Railroad, including those
issued to the Western Pacific Railroad Company, will have fallen due and
paid or must on that day be paid by the Government. Without any reier
ence to the application of the sinking fund now in the treasury this will
create such a default on the pnrt of these companies to the Government as
will give it the right to at orice institute proceedings to foreclose its mort
gage lien. Inaidition to tins indebtedness, which will be January 1,
1897, there will mature between that date and January 1, 1899, the re
mai .ing principal of such subsidy bonds, which mu<l a. so be met by the
Government. These amount to more than $20,000,000 on account of the
I'niou Pacific lines and exceed $21,000,000 on account of the Central
Pacific lines.
The situation of these roads and the condition of their indebtedness
to the Government have been f ully set forth in the reports of various com
mittees to the present and prior Congress; and as early as 1887 they were
thorouKhly examined by a special commission appointed pursuant to an
act of Congress. The consideration requiring an adjustment of the Gov
ernment's relations to the companies have been cleany presented and the
conclusion reached with practical uniformity that ii these relations are
not terminated they should ba revised upon a basis assuring their sale
continuance.
Under c section of the act of Congress psssed March 3, 1887, the Presi
dent is charged with the duty in the event that any mortgage or other in-
Cumbrance paramount to the interest of the United States in the property
of the Pacific railroads shail exist and be lawfully Hub c to be enforced, to
direct the action of the Departments of Treasury and of Justice in the pro
tection of the interest of the United States by redemption or through judi
cial proceedings, including foreclosures of the Government liens. In view
of the fact that Congress has for a number of years almost constantly had
under consideration various plans for dealing with tlie conditions exist
ing between these- roads and the Government I have thus far felt justified
in withholding action under the statu-e above mentioned.
In < he case of the Union Pacific, however, the situation has become
especially and immediately urgent. Proceedings have been instituted to
foreclose a first mortgage upon tuese aided parts of the main line upon
which the Government holds a feoond and subordinate mortgage lien. In
consequence of these proceeding:, and increasing complications, added to
the deiauit occurring on the Ist day of January, 1597, a condition will be
presented at that date so lar as this enmpony is concerned that must em
phasize the mandate of the act of 1887 and give to executive duly under
its provisions a more imperative aspect.
Therefore, unless Congress shall otherwise direct, or shall have pre
viously determined upon a different solution of the problem, there will
hardly apnear to exist any reason for delaying beyond the date of the
default above mentioned, such executive action as will promise to sub
serve the public interests and save the Government from the loss threat
ened by further inaction.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
The Department of Agriculture is bo intimately related to the welfare
of our people and the prosperity of our Nation that it should constantly
receive the care and encouragement of the Government. From small be
ginnings it has grown to be the center of agricultural intelligence and
the source of aid and encouragement to agricultural efforts. Large sums
of money are annually appropriated for the maintenance of this depart
ment, and it must be confessed that the legislation relating to it has not
always been directly In the interest of practical farming or properly
guarded against waste and extravagance. So far, however, the public
money has been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help those who
actually till the soil. No expenditure has been more profitably made or
more generally approved by the people.
Under the present management of the department its usefulness has
been enhanced in every direction, and at the same time strict economy
has been enforced to the utmost extent permitted by Coneressional action.
From the reports of the Secretary it appears that through careful and
Erudent financial management he has annually saved n, large sum from
is appropriations, aggregating during his incumbency and up to tha
close of the fiscal year nearly one-tilth of the entire amount appropriated.
These results have been accomplished by a conscientious study of the
reul needs of the farmer and such a regard for economy as the genuine
farmer ought to appreciate, supplemented by a ri/ld adherence to civil
service methods In a department which should be conducted in the inter
est of agriculture instead of partisan politic.-. The Secretary reports that
the value of our exports of farm products during tne lust fiscal year
amounted to $570,000,000, an increase of $17,000,000 over thos> of the
year Immediately preceding. This statement is not the less welcome be
cause of the fact that, notwithstanding such increase, the proportion of
exported agricultural products to our total exports of all descriptions fell
over during tne year. The benefits of an increase in agricultural exports
being assured, the decrease in its proportion to our tot/il exports is the
more gratifying when we consider that it is owing to tho fact that such
total exports tor the year increased more than $75 000,000.
The large and increasing exportation of our ngricultural products sug
gests the great usefulness of the organization lately established in the de
partment for the purpose of giving to those engaged in farming pursuits
reliable information concerning the condition, needs and advantages of
different foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success of ihe furmer depends
upon the advantageous sale of his products aud inasmuch as foreign
markets must largely be the destination of such products, it is quite
apparent that a knowledge of th- conditions and wauts that affect those
markets ought to result in sowing more intelligently and reaping with a
better promise of profit such information voints out tha way to a
prudent foresight in the selection and cultivation of crops and to a
release from the bondage of unreasoning monoiony of production, a
flatted and depressed market and constantly recurring unprofitable toil,
n my opinion, the gratuitous distribution of seeds by the department, as
at present conducted, ought to be discontinued. No one can read the state
ment o! the Secretary on this subject and doubt the extravagance and
questionable results of this practice. The processed friends of the farmer
and certainly the farmers themselves are naturally expected to be willing
to rid a department devoted to the promotion of farming interests of a
feature which tends so much to its discredit.
The Weather Bureau, now attached to the Department of Agriculture,
has continued to extend its sphere oi U'efulness, and by an uninterrupted
improvement in the accuracy of its lorecusts has greatiy increased its
efficiency as an aid and protection to all whose occupation-, are related to
weather conditions. Omitting further reierence to the operations of the
department. I commend the Secretary's report and the suggestions it
contains to the careful consideration of the Congress.
PROGRESS IN CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The progress made in civil service reform call* for the utmost congrat
ulations. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well as the rancor of
Its enemies, and has gained a permanent place among the agencies des
tined to cleanse our politics and to improve, economize and elevate the
public service. There are now in the competitive classified service up
ward of 34,000 places. More than half of these have been included from
time to time since March 4, 1893. A most radical and sweeping exten
sion was made by executive order iatud the sixth day of May, 1890"; and if
fourth-class postmasterships are not included in the statement, it may be
said that practically all positions contemplated by the civil service law
are now Classified. Abundant reasons exist for including these postmas
tersnips based on economy, Improved service aad the peace and quiet of
neighborhoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such action at present, I
earnestly hope ttiat Congress will, without increasing postoffice appro
priations, so adjus; them as to permit la proper cases a cons <lniatinn of
these postoffices. to the end that through this process the result desired
may, to a limited extent, be accomplished.
The civil service rules as amended during the last ypar -provide for a
sensible and uniform method of promotiou, basing eligibility to better
positions upon demonstrated efficiency and faithfulness. The absence of
fixed rules on this subject has be-n an infirmity in the system more and
more apparent, as its other benefits have been better appreciated. The
advantages of civil service methods in their business aspects are too well
understood To require argument. Their application has become a neces
sity to the executive work of the Government. But these who gain
positions through the operation of these metnods should be made to
understand that the non-partisan scheme through which they receive
their appointments demands from them, by way of reciprocity, non
partisan and faithful performance of duty under every administration and
cheerful fidelity to every chief. While they should be encouraged to
deftently exercise their rights of cit'zenship and to support through their
suffrages the political beliefs they honestly prufesÂ«, the noisy, pestilent
and partisan employe who loves polltfral turmoil and contention, or who
renders lax and grudging service to an administration not representing
his political views, should be promptly and fearlessly dealt with in such a
way bs to furnish a warniug-to others who may be likewise disposed. The
annual report of the Commissioners will be duly transmitted, and 1 comm
end the important matter they have in charge to the careful considera
tion of Congress.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION.
The Interstate Commerce Commission has during the last year sup
plied abundant evidence of its usefulness and the importance of the work
committed to its charge. Public transportation is a universal necessity
and the question of just and reasonable charges therefore has become one
of vital importance, not only to shippers and carriers, Dut also to the vast
multitude oi producers and corsumers. The justice and equity of the
principles embodied in the existing law passed for the purpose of regu-
Iniiug these charges are everywhere conceded, and there appears to be no
Question that the policy thus entered upon has a permanent piace in our
lejsisifltion. As the present statute when enacted was, in the nature of the
Cuse, more or less tentative and experimental, it was hardly expected to
supply a complete and adequate system. Wnile its wholesome effects ate
manifest and have amply jnstitied its enactment, it is evident that all
desir.d reforms and transportation methods have not been fuliy
accomplished.
In view of the judicial interpretation which some provisions of this
statute have received And the defects disclosed by the efforts made for
its enforcement, its revision and amendment appear to be essential to the
end that it may more effectually rencii the evils designed to be cor
rected. I hope tho recommendations of the commissioiuupoa this subject
will be promptly and favorably considered by Congress.
SUGGESTIONS ON THE TARIFF LAWS.
I desire to recnr to the statements elsewhere made concerning the
Government's receipts and expenditures for tho purpose of venturing
upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operations.
This statute took effect on the 28th day of August, 1894. Whatever may
be its shortcomings as a complete measure of tariff reform, it must be
conceded that it has opened the wav to a freer and greater exchange
or commodities between us and other countries, and thus furnished a
wider market for our products and manufacturing. The only entire fiscal
year during which this law has been in force ended on t:ie 30ih d-.y of
June, 1896. In that year our imports increased over those of tne pre
vious year more than $0,500,000, while the value of the domestic prod
ucts we exported and which found markets abroad was nearly $70,000,000
more than during the preceding year.
Those who insist thnt the cost to our people of articles coming to
them from abroud lor their needful use should only be increased through
tariff charges to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of tne
Government, as weii as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid
upon such articles beyond the necessities of Government revenue, and
with the additional purpose of increasing their price in our mar
kets so as to give American manu.acturers and producers better
and more profitable opportunities, must agree that our tariff
laws are oily primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the
Government to mt-et the necessary expenses oi its maintenance. Consid
ered as to its sufficiency in this aspect, the present law can by no means
fall under just condemnation. During the only complete fiscal year of iis
operation it has yielded nearly $8. 000,000 more revenue than was ie
celved from tariff duties in the preceding year. There was, nevertheless,
a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a little more than $25,
-000,000.
i be situation was such in December, seven months before the close of
the fiscal year, that the Secretary of the Treasury foretold a deficiency of
$17,000,000. The great and increasing apprehension and timidity in
boalue*! circles and the depression in all activities intervening since that
time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood, and entirely dis
connected with our tariff law or its operations, seriously checked the im
ports we would have Otherwise received, and readily account tor the differ
ence between the estimate of the Secretary and the actual deficiency as
well as for a continued deficit. Indeed, it must be coniessv-a that we
cou'd hardly have had a moie unfavorable period than the iast two years
for the collection of a tariff revenue. We cannot reasonably hope that
our recuperation from this business depression will b<? sudden, but ft has
already set in, with a promise of acceleration and continuance. I beiove
our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity , will in the near future
yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditure, will
overcome all deficiencies. In the meantime no deficit that has occurred
or may occur need excite or disturb us. *
To meet any such deficit we have in the treasury, in addition to a gold
reserve, of one hundred millions, a surplus oi more than oue hundred and
twenty-eight mi. ions of dollars, applicab.e to the payment oi the expenses
of the Government and which must, unless expended for that purpose, re
main a useless hoard or, if not extravagantly wasted, must in any event
be perverted lrom the purpose of its exaction from our people. The pay
ment, therefore, of any deficiency in the revenue from this lund Is nothing
more than its proper and legitimate use. The Government thus applying
a surplus fortunately in i s treasury to the payment of expenses not met
by its current revenues is not to be likened to a man living beyond his
income and thus incurring deb', or encroaching on his principal. It is
not one of the functions of our Government to accumulate and make addi
tions to a fund not needed for immediate expenditure. With individuals
it is the chief object oi struggle and effort. The application of an accumu
lated fuud by the Government to the payment of its running expenses
is a duty.
An individual living beyond his means and embarrassing himself
with debt, or drawing upon his accumulated fuud of principal is either
unfortunate or improvident. The distinction is between a Government,
charged with the duiy of expending for the benefit of the people and
for proper purposes ail the money it receives from Hny source, and the
Individual who is expected to manifest a natur.il desire to avoid debt or
to accumulate as much as po*sib c and touve within the income derived
from such accumulation, to tne end that they may be increased, or at
least remain unimpaired for the future use nnd enjoyment of himself and
objects of his love and aoection, who may survive hini.
It is immeasurably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment
of justifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to reckless
appropriations and extravagant expenditures. I suppose it will not be
denied that under the present iaw our people obtain the necessaries of a
comfortable existence at a cheaper rate than formerly. This is a matter
of supreme importance since it is the palpable duty of every just govern
ment to make the burdens of taxation as light as possible. Tne people
should not be required to re'.inquifh this privilege of cheap living except
under the stress of their governments necessarily made plainly manifest.
A FINANCIAL REFORM REQUIRED.
This reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues natur
ally suggest 3an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial
methods. They have been frequently pressed upon the attention of Cod
gress in previous cxc cv tive communications and the inevitable danger of
their continued toleration pointed out. Without now repealing these
evils, I cannot refrain from again earnestly presenting the necessity ot the
prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance and
shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and perplexity.
The terrible Civil War, which s.iool the foundations of our Government
more than thirty years ago, brought in its train the destruction of prop
erty, the wasting of our country's substance and the estrange mom of
brethren. These are now pist nnd forgotten. Even the distressing loss of
life the conflict entailed is but a sacred memory wliich fo-ieis patriotic
sentiment and keeps alive a te:ider regard for those who nobly died. And
yet there remains with us to-dny in full strength, as an incident of that
tremendous struggle, a feature of its financial necessities, not only un
suited to our present circumstances, but manl:est!y a disturbing menace
to business security and an sver present agent ot monetary distress.
Because we may be enjoyin â ; a temporary relief from its depressing in
fluence this should not lull us into a false security nor lead us to forget
the suddenness of past visitations. lam more convinced hnn ever that
we can have no assured financial peace and safety until the Governm^ut
currency obligations upon which gold may bedemanded from the treasury
are withdrawn irom circulation nnd canceled. This might be done, us
has been heretofore recommended, by their exchange for long term bonds
bearing a low rate of inte;est or tiy their redemption with the proceeds of
such bonds. Even If only the United States notes known an greenbacks
â were thus retired it is pn, bible ihat the treasury notes issued in payment
of silver purchases under tne act of July 14, 1890, now paid in gold when
demanded, would not create such disturbance as they might from time to
time when received in the tieasury by redemption In jiold or otherwise,
be gradually and prudently r-plaC'd by silver coin. This plan of issuing
bonds for the purpose of redemption' certainly appears to be the most
effective and direct path to tue needed reform.
In default of this, howtver. it would be a step in the right direction if
currency obligations redeemub> in gold, whenever so redeemed, should
be canceled instead of being reissued. This operation would be a slow
remedy, but It would improve present conditions. National banks should
redeem their notes. They should be allowed to issue circulated to the par
value of bonds deposited as security for their redemption and the tax on
their circulation should be reduced to oue-tourth of one per cent. In con
sidering projects for the retirement of United States notes and treasury
notes issued under the law of 1890,1 am of the opiuion that we have
placed too much stress upon the danger of contracting the currency and
have calculated too little upon the gold that would be added to our circu
lation if inviUd to us by better aud safer financial methods. It not so
much a contraction of our currency that should be avoided as such un
equal distribution.
This might be obviated and auy fear of harmful contraction at the
same time removed by allowing the organization of smaller banks and in
less populous communities t; on are now permit led, and authorizing banks
to estanlish brnuches in small communities under proper restriction.
The entire case may be presented by the statement that the day ot sensi
ble and sound financial mÂ»-tii<..d will not dawn ui>on usuntii our Gov
ernment abandons the tanking business and the p.ccumulation of innds
and conJiues its monetary operation! to the receipt of the money contrlb
uie-1 by this people for it>- support, and to the expenditure oi such money
for the people's benefit. Our business interests and ail good citizens long
fo: rost from fevrish .ij;'tatio:i and the inauguration by IM Government
of a reformed financial policy which will encourage enterprise aud make
certain the rewards of labor and industry
AS TO TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES.
Another topic in which our people rightfully take a deep Interest may
be here briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and other huge
aggiegations of capital, the object oi which is to secured the monopoly of
some particular branch of trade, industry or commerce and so stifle whole
some competition. When the^e are defeuded it is usually on the ground
that thouah they iucrease profits they also reduce prices and thus may
benefit the public. It must be remembered, however, that a reduction of
prices to the people is not one ot the real objects of these organizations,
nor is their tendency necessarily in that direction. If it occurs in a par
ticular case it is only because it accords with the purpose or interest oj
those managing the scheme. Such occasional result* tall far short ot
compensating tho palpable evils charged to the account ot trusts ana
monopolies. Tncir tendency is to crush out individual independence and
to hinder or prevent the free use of human faculties and the lull develop
ment of human character. .
Through them the farmer, the artisan and the small trader is in dan
ger of dislodgment from the proud position of being his own master,
watchful of all that touches his country's prosperity, in which he nas an
individunl lot, aud interested in ail that affects the advantages ot business
of which he is a factor, to ba relegated to the level of a mere appurtenance
to a greiit machine, with litrie free will, with no duty but that ; of passive
obedience, and with little hopeor opportunity of rising in the scale of
responsible nnd healtluul citizenship. To the instinctive belief that such
is the inevitable trend ot' trusts and monopolies is duo the Â« -niesj.r. a<l and
decp-eated popular aversion in which thtÂ»y are held, and the not un
reasonable in-.ist.-nce that whatever may be their incidental cconom c ad
vantages, their general effect u?on personal character, prospect* aud use
lulnrss cannot ho otherwise limn injurious.
Though Congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legisla
tion, the laws passed lor thnt purpose thus fur have proved ineffective, not
because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but simply
bcrause the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not reacii tne
d.ffieulty. If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be r-rnedieJ by fur
ther legislation it should be done. It should be recognizeo. however, that
all financial legislation on this subject may fitll short ol its purpose be
cause of inherent obstacles, a; Â«l .ilso because of the complex character of
our Governmental system, which, while making the Federal authority
supreme within its sphere, has i-treiully limned that sphere by Bound â 
which cannot be transprcsse I. Tne decision of our highest court on the
precise question renders it quiie doubtful whether the evns of trusts aud
monopolies can be adequately treated through Federal action, unless they
SJek directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation or
intercourse between States or between the United btates and foreign
It doeo not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that
may be applied Even though it may be found that Federalnu-honties are
not broad enotogh to fully reach the case there can be no doubt ot the
power of the several States to act effectively in the premises, ana there
should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously exercise such
power.
AN APPEAL FOR RIGID ECONOMY.
In concluding tnis communication its last words shall be an appeal to
, Congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the money
it hoids in trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagance is
easy, but a return to frugality is difficult. When, however, it is consid
ered that those who can bear the burdens of taxation hnve no guaranty of
honestcare save in the fidelity of th:ir public servants, tho duty of all
possible retrenchment is plainly manifest. When our differences are fo-
gotten and our contests and political opinions are no longer remembered,
nothing in the retrospect of our public service will be as fortunate and
comforting as the recollection of official duiy well performed and the
memory oi a constant devotion to the interests of our confiding fellow
countrymen. Grovee Cleveland.

The President's annual message wa3
,re^d without evoking any special interest.
"The only exception to the rule was as to
the portions of the message devoted to

â ^of. Christendom."
Tiie President's discussion of the Cuban

presented when our obligations to the

WASHINGTON, D.\C, Dec. 7.â Senator
Palmer, late Gold Money Democratic can
didate for President, received a frigid re
ception at the hands of the Silver Demo
cratic Senators. His former friends, like
Senators Jones, Cockrell, Pascoe and Vest,
showed extreme coldness toward the
juniot Illinois Senator. Republican Sen
ators noticed it, stepped into the breach
and were effusive in their greeting. The
studied effort on the part of the silverites
to avoid Senator Palmer was the subject
of a quiet conference in the rear of the
Senate chamber between Vilas, Gray and
Palmer during the reading of the Presi
dent's message. The isolation of the
Gold Democratic Senators was so marlced
that people in the galleries noticed it and
it soon became the subject of gossip in
the restaurants and lobbies.
HUN TING TON'S MEN ON HAND.
They Will Make a Desperate Effort to
Pass the Refunding Bill at
This Session.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 7.â lt is
generally believed among Californians
here that Mr. Huntington will make a
desperate effort to pass his refunding bill
at this session of Congress, and they are
very anxious for Senator White to get
here and help Senator Morgan fight the
bill in the upper house.
RepreÃesentative Grove L. Johnson and
John Boyd, Huntington's right-hand man,
had a long talk to-night at the Hotel
Regent.
Judge Maguire said to The Call corre
spondent to-night: -'The indications are
that a speedy and determined effort is to
be made to pass the funding bill in both
houses. My information to-night is that
Senator Gear will call the matter up in
the Senate at tbe earliest possible moment
and endeavor to secure its passage there
tirst. If this be true no time is to be lost
in preparing for the battle here. I am
assured to-night that nearly all the Demo
crats in the House will vote against re
funding tbe Pacific railroad's debt. The
exceptions are among the gold Democrats
who refuse to recognize the Chicago plat
form. Fortunately they are few and far
between."
SUICIDE OF OWEN O'CONNOR.
The Real Estate Dealer, the Thirty-Ninth
Witness in the Cronin Murder
Trial, to Die.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 7.â Henry Owen
O'Connor, a real estate dealer here, com
mitted suicide at his home, 4507 Wabash
avenue, this afternoon by shooting him
self through the heart. He was interested
to a considerable extent in stocks and was
identified with Marcus Daly in some of
the latter's large holdings in Montana.
A few days ago he had expressed his in
tention of leaving for Wilcox, Ariz., where
he is interested in mining property, and
had made all tbe preparations for the de
parture. This afternoon he asked his wife
to go to the drugstore for some medicine,
and he shot himself during her absence.
He is well known in real estate circles in
Chicago, and it is supposed that ill health
and business complications led him to
take his life. Before doing the act he
wrote a note to his wife. O'Connor was
active on the side of the prosecution in
the Cronin murder and is the thirty-ninth
witness who has died. He leaves no chil
dren.
ALL BANDS ON A STRIKE.
Presstnen t Compositors and Bookbind
ers Join in a Walkout.
CHICAGO. 111., Dec. 7.â One hundred
and fifty pressmen, compositors, book
binders and press-feeders are now out on
strike at the printing establishment of
Donohue & Hennebery. Thirty press
feeders went out in sympathy this morn
ing. The strike originated with the com
positors because the firm refused to dis
charge an objectionable foreman, but the
company is also accused of breaking its
contract with the Typographical Union
relating to the employment of a certain
number of union men.
Non-union men were put to work in
place of the strikers and a large number
were brought from other cities. Several
fistic encounters occurred during the day,
and more trouble is expected.
Hamburg's rtoclc Strike.
HAMBURG. Gbbkaht, Dec. 7.âNu
merous meetings of the striking dock
laborers were held in this city to-day.
The largest of these v;as a mass- meeting
at which Herr Holkenburr, Socialist
member of the Reichstag for Hamburg,
announced that the subscriptions to the
fund for the support of the strikers had so
increased that the distributors of the fund
would be enabled to raise the weekly
grants to unmarried men by one mark a
week and to give to unmarried men an
additional allowance according to the
number of children in their families.
The employers have held another meet
ing at which their refusal to submit the
dispute between the striking dockmen
and themselves to an arbitration tribunal
was reaffirmed. The action of the em
ployers is due to the fact that a guarantee
amounting to $250,000, has been signed
for the protection and relief of the smaller
employers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896.
POINTED COMMENT
ON THE MESSAGE
Declared to Be Colorless
and Lacking in Bold
Treatment
Cleveland No Longer Assumes to
Advise Congress or Act
as a Dictator.
Some California Statesmen Declare
That the President's Effusion
Is Void of Surprises.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 7.â When
Congress convened to-day at noon the
Pacific Coast was well represented. Sen
ators Perkins, Stewart, Jones, Mitchell
and Wilson of Washington were in their
Beats. Senator McÃride of Oregon is con
fined to his bed by sickness.
Senator White is yet at Los Angeles
and his colleagues are anxiously awaiting
his arrival, for it is feared the Pacific
roads refunding bill will be brought up in
the Senate before he can reach here.
In the House of Representatives the fol
lowing California members were in their
seats: Maguire, Johnson, Barham, Hil
born and Loud. McLachlan will arrive
Wednesday. Dowers will be detained at
San Diego for a week or ten days.
On Mr. Loud's desk was a beautiful
floral design, the gift of postal clerks, who
appreciate the service Mr. Loud has en
deavored to render them in his capacity
as chairman of the Committee on Postof
fices and Postroads.
In both the Senate and House the Presi
dent's message received but perfunctory
attention. This is always tbe case. Most
of the statesmen prefer to read the mes
sage in the evening papers.
Mr. Cleveland's reference to the Gor
man-Wilson act was amusing to those [
members of the House who remember the
famous "perfidy" letter which the Presi
dent wrote to Chairman Wilson and which
met gentleman read in the open House
after the passage of the bill.
Mr. Cleveland rejects the idea that more
revenue is needed and falls back on his
former proposition to issue long-term low
rate bonds with which to retire the green
backs or the repeal of the law which now
compels the Secretary of the Treasury to
reissue the greenbacks. It is fair to as
sume that Secretary Carlisle will elaborate
both these propositions in his report to
Congress. However, as the Republican
party will pay no attention to either sug
gestion, but will proceed (as socn as it
assumes power) to provide the treasury j
with sufficient revenue, these discussions
are superfluous.
Mr. Cleveland's reference to his latest
order affecting the extension of the civil
service system to the consular service
must be read with caution. While under
his order the consular service is now under
civil service rules it must be remembered
tbat this has been done upon his execu
tive order and not by the authority of the
Civil Service Commission, though of
course that body was in entire accord
with the step.
While, therefore, the incoming Secre
tary of State may, if he wishes, follow the
policy inaugurated by Secretary Olney,
he is not legally bound to do so. Â£Nt the
sweeping order of May 6, to which the
President points with pride and by which
he placed within the classified service
every office in the executive departments,
cannot be rescinded except by an act of
Congress, ani it is a fact that no order
extending the civil service in the depart
ments has ever been rescinded by act of
Congress.
Mr. Cleveland's reference to the ineffi
ciency of the anti-trust laws will receive a
practical illustration during the next few
ruon ths, for it is announced that Attorney-
General Harmon proposes, during the J
short span of official life still left to him, i
to make another attempt to proceed
against cue or more of tbe most offensive
of these combinations.
Senator Perkins, when asked to-night
what he thought of the message, said that
although portions of it were disappointing,
on the whole he considered it a conserva
tive and wise state paper, such as might
be expected of Mr. Cleveland.
He said, however, that his references to
the Cuban affair and other matters indi
cated rather a new departure on tbe part
of the President, for while Mr. Cleveland
had heretofore been very obstinate in as
serting his own views, and seemed to ar
rogate to himself all matters of foreign
and domestic policy, he departed from
this course in the message delivered to-day
and seemed content to give Congress all
the information he had at hand and made
but few recommendations.
He construed Cleveland's reference to
the Pacific Coast roads as meaning that
while the Executive had refrained from
interfering with these railroads as here
tofore, because propositions for their set
tlement were pending in Congress, he
gave notice in the message that unless the
matter was settled by January 1 ihe Ex
ecutive, through tbe Department of Jus
tice, would take "the steps required by
law.
Senator Perkins said: ''Of course it
would be superfluous for me to tell The
Call readers where I stand on the ques
tion of the Pacific roads debts. I
have iterated and reiterated my views
on this question. The President said
said nothing about Hawaii. Tim was dis
appointing, but I will say to you that I
do not favor annexation under conditions
now existing on the island. Our treaty of j
tariff reciprocity has been one-sided.
Hawaii has derived vastly more benefit
than we have.
"I cannot help but bslieve that the
President was right in advising the Repub
licans to frame a conservative lariff in or
der to hold the sound-money Democrats. I
believe in a moderate tariff billâ one suffi
cient for revenue only. Yet I roust insist
that our California fruits, almonds, wal
nuts, quicksilver and other products of
our State be amply protected. I believe
in putting a special duty of \% cents per
pound on sugar in place of the ad valorem
duty of 40 per cent. The manufÃCture of
beet sugar in California promises to be a
great industry, and must be amply pro
tected."
Judge Magnire said: "The President's
message is, I think, generally unsatisfac
tory because of its inconclusiveness. On
the Cuban question it is non-committal,
stating the facts as contended for by both
parties, but failing to state tbe facts as he
has found them upon investigation. He
makes propositions for future actions
based upon possible future developments.
Cn the ;â  question of J { migration 'â % he
gives certain statistics "{ apparently com
piled from 1 the published report ;of
the Commissioner of â  Immigration,
his only - conclusion being that 'the
apprehension heretofore existing to some
extent of a large immigration from Japan
to the United States is without any sub
stantial foundation.' His discussion of
the army and navy is commonplace. He
bewails the alienation of the public lands
indiscriminately to ; settlers) and monop
olists, ; suggesting no remedy for existing
monopoly, but in a helpless sort of way
urging that the remainder of our public
lands (by far the least valuable portion)
'should be more carefully dealt with and
their alienation guarded by , better
economy, and greater prudence.' :
"On the question of the \ Pacific rail
roads, after calling attention to the exist
ing condition of the debt and the various j
Dills introduced in Congress, but not
passed/having in view a readjustment of
the debts, he plainly teils Congress that
unless some such bill is passed before the
Ist of January next he will be J obliged [to
enfore the provisions of , existing law.
Why he should concern himself about
bills in Congress and not passed I do not
know, and he does explain why he is not so
much concerned about the necessity of
foreclosing the Pacific road mortgages.
"His suggestions on the tariff question,
if addressed to a tariff for revenue Con
gress might be deserving ,of â  some con
sideration, but being addressed to the
present Congress under existing circum
stances are simply ludicrous. On the
money question, his only suggestion for
the relief of conditions caused by a
scarcity of money is the retirement 'of
some four hundred million dollars of the
paper money of the United States by
issuing interest bearing long-term j bonds
for them.
' "The differences between the money he
proposes to retire, and the bonds which
he proposes to issue for them" are: First,
that the bonds will bear interest while the
paper money does not; that "the paper is
taxable, -while the bonds will not be tax
able, and that the paper circulate a3 money
while . the bonds will not. His financial
propositions have heretofore been rejected
by a Democratic as well as a Republican
Congress, and are likely to meet with the
same fate this time. His message shows
that all men who favor tariff reform are
not necessarily statesmen."
Judge Barham said: "I 1 think the
President's message is a surprise from the
fact that it contains no surprises." Upon the
Cuban question the message is, in my
judgment, what it ought to be. There
seems to be no sufficient evidence to war
rant the belief that there is anything but
a kind of guerrilla warfare in Cuba. â¢ I
have never reached a fever heat over the
independence of Cuba and doubt the
capacity of those people to govern them
selves, and it is highly probable that some
kingly power, firmly and honestly exer
cised, is the better form of government
there.
"I see no reason why the United States
should endanger war with a great nation
by undertaking to become -general guar
dian over such people. A point might be
reached beyond which civilization will
permit no nation to go, but it is hardly
proper to presume so great a' nation :as
Spain will j:o to that extreme. At all
events, let us have evidence of the fact and
not presume. Of course i do not agree
with the President upon his ideas of tariff
legislation. I think there should be an
extra session of Congress and a protective
tariff measure passed. â¢ ,' ?â  -
I "The election of 1894, as well as the last
one, evidences the will of the people upon
this subject. When this is gone the ques
tion of silver should be submitted for in
ternational agreement. . 1 am - much
inclined to the opinion that the financial
question needs little or no Congressional
legislation. Agitution is not what is
needed. What we want is business con
fidenceâthe result will be prosperity." â > â¢
Representative Loud said the President's
allusions to Cuba were dignified and suf
ficiently aggressive. He thought. a fur
ther loss of life and property in ' Cuba
might be prevented in some honorable
way without our intervention. ';
"We â  had better get our own Govern
ment on an even keel before we meddle
with other nations' affairs,", said Mr.
Loud, who also expressed himself opposed
to Hawaiian annexation. Mr. Loud was
well pleased with the President's refer
ence to the postal bill of which the Cali
fornian is the author. The President in
corporated in his message: parts- of Mr.
Loud's committee report on this subject.
Judge Hiliorn said that the message
was admirable and quite like Mr. Cleve
land's usual literary effusions, but there
was a very >â¢ marked departure from the
tone of former messages, for the President
does not now assume to even advise Con
gress, much less to arrogate to himself the
role of dictator. -A 4- W. )'Â£-.' ' â 
Mr. Hilborn . said that the message was
colorless and. lacked the bold treatment
which has' heretofore characterized Pres
dent Cleveland's messages, He attributed
Mr. Cleveland's conservatism to his de
sire not to embarrass the incoming ad
ministration. . Mr. liilborn was well
pleased with that part of the message
which treated of naval affairs and coast
fortifications. â¢ Hilborn will soon intro
duce a bill to establish at Benicia, Cal., a
repair station for gun carriages. This will
be a start, he believes, in the direction of
establishing at this point a factory lor the
assembling heavy ordnance for the army
and; navy. Mr. Hilborn will also try to
secure appropriations for enlargements of
shops at the Mare Island yard and for
tools. '
Senator Dubois said to The Call corre
spondent to-night that the , President in
his annual message to Congress advanced
his usual radical views on the currency
and advocated the retire of g*een-
Dacks by the issuance of bond*. In effect
his advice was that the Government go
out of the banking business and leave the
issuance '.of currency to the national
banki. Â 'â¢â ;â¢. vjiCixU.
Senator Dubois expressed the opinion
that neither this â¢ Congress , nor the next
would attempt to contract the currency or
give ; such power to the national banks.
Ho said that in his opinion .the Republi
cans victorious in the late election would
not seek to change the existing financial
system. The President said nothing now
in his reference to Cuban affairs. [ /.But the
Senator did not criticize this portion of
the message, for he agrees with .the Presi
dent that we had better let Cuban affairs
take their own course and not interfere at

DISCUSSED AT CANTON.
Major McKinley Reads the Message
With Interest.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 7.â The burden ol
Hit talk in Canton and at the home of the
President-elect to-day was about President
Cleveland's message to Congress. The
people about the town discussed it. The
visitors discussed it, and some of tbe
Congressmen who wera here to-day mildly
criticized certain parts of it.
Major McKinley read it from copy fur
nished him by one of the telegraph com
panies an hour or so before Congress as
sembled. The opening sentence with its
strong implied approval of the results of
the recent election seemed full of pleasant
interest for the President-elect, though he
made no verbal comment upon any por
tion of the document. He read aloud
parts of it to a group of friends, and they
commented occasionally on some of the
writer's observations.
Major McKinley turned to the portion
of the message devoted to the consider
ation of Cuban affairs with the keenest
interest and read it aloud in clear, in
cisive and firmest tones. A Congressman
who was near by said: "President Cleve
land's exposition *cf the Cuban problem
and his statement o( the existing con
ditions is just, graphic and conservative,
but it is much less sympathetic with the
insurgents than most people hoped for. I
do not think bis idea about home rule for
Cuba wiil come to anything practical, for
the Cubans will not trust the Spanish
.Government and would put no faith in
their fairest promises. It looks to me as
though we would have to recognize the
insurgents as belligerents within ninety
days."
"DIGNIFIED LANGUAGE."
Attitude of the President Toward
Turkey Pleases English
Papers.
LONDON, Eno., Dec. 7.â Commenting
upon Cleveland's message, the Standard
says: "It is dignified^and able and is
marked throughout with sterling
common sense. It deserves and
will doubtless obtain the serious
steely of the European powers." The Stan
dard is of the opinion that the message
will excite bitterness in Spain, who, never
theless, must make up her mind to listen
to friendly counsel. Spaniards may be
excused if they detect a tone of menace.
The condition of Cuba will certainly not
induce impartial observers to say that
menace is unwarranted.
The paper dwells on Mr. Cleveland's
pointed reassertion of the Monroe doc
trine in the paragraph reading: "What
ever circumstances may arise our policy
and our interests would constrain us to
object to the acquisition of the island or
any interference with its control by aDy
other power."
It sees in this the intention of the
United States to claim a virtual protec
torate over the continent and the islands
thereof. This, it adds, is a large and bold
policy, that is not quite free from danger,
as Spain is not the only power with which
the United States might thereby become
embroiled.
The paper expresses the opinion tbat if
Spain found a powerful foreign friend in
Europe to help prevent Cuba from pass
ing from her hands, the objections of the
United States, bated on the Monroe
doctrine, would not be of much account.
Fortunately there seems to be no real
risk that the Monroe doctrine will occa
sion further disputes with Great Britain.
la conclusion the Standard refers to the
passages referring to tbe satisfactory end
ing of the Venezuelan dispute, and says
that the dignified language of the message
where it refers to Turkey shows the powers
tbat they can be assured of the cordial
support of the United States in executing
corrective measures in that country.
The Daily News is chiefly impressed by
the section of the message referring to
Cuba. It admits that the Americans can
not be permanently indifferent to the dis
astrous war. but says that while the in
tentions of President Cleveland and Secre
tary of State Olney may be evor so good,
European opinion is not favorable to the
latest version of the Monroe doctrine, and
Spain will bave some influential support
if she holds out for it.
The Chronicle will say in a leader on
tbe same subject that the alternative be
fore Spain is really to either satisfy the
Cubans or ha\e Cuba taken from her for
cibly. In conclusion the paper says: We
advise Spain in her own interest to sell
Cuba quickly, but he wonld be no friend
of the United States who would advise
the latter to buy the island."
NEW YORK VIEWS.
Attention Given to the President's
Reference to the Cuban
Situation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 7.âComment
ing upon Cleveland's message, the prin
cipal metropolitan dailies will to-morrow
say:
The Sun: "The Cuban chapter is ably
written in a style differing conspicuously
from thatof the opening and cioaing para
graphs of the message. Its statements
and suggestions hold the attention closely
until you come to the disheartening con
clusion.
'â¢In well-balanced periods sympathy for
the struggling patriots and friendship and
admiration for Spain are equally dispensed.
"With the happy consciousness of having
unloaded everything this wonderful states
man winds up his last message to Con
gress with a beautiful tribute to himself:
'Wnen our differences are foreotten and
our contests of political opinion are no
longer remembered, nothing in the retro
spect of our public service wiil be as for
tunate and comforting as the recollection
of official duty well performed and the
memory of a constant devotion to the in
terests of our confiding fellow-country
men.'
"His confiding fellow-countrymen will
not doubt that the final paragraph at least
is Mr. Clevpland's own. Only two men
who ever lived could have written it, and
Mr. Pecksniff is dead."
The Times: "Mr. Cleveland made a
singularly clear statement of the political
situation and of the course of events that
has produced it."
The Tribune: "It is now more than
twelve years since Cleveland, by his nomi
nation against Blame, became the un
questioned leader ol a great National
party.
"To him it is largely due that a disas
trous change in the tariff has been
effected, and but for him the effort of that
party to deba*e the National currency and
tarnish the National honor might have
prevailed."
The Herald: "President Cleveland
notes that affairs in Cuba are worse
than they were a year ago; that
Spain has not succeeded in estab
lishing her authority, and that the
putative Cuban Government exists only
on paper and that both sides are now
engaged in a wholesale annihilation of
property, under which the industrial
value of the island must soon be wiped
out."
The Journal: "The space which Presi
dent Cleveland ,devotes to the recipro
cal interests of Cuba, Spain and
tbe United States in his last an
nual message to Congress indicates that
he is not wholly insensible to the
agitation of the question which has long
progressed in this country. But his con
clusions show beyond a doubt that he will
leave to his successor the honor of taking
the first step to assure Cuban liberty."

SECRETARY OLNEY
MAKES A REPORT
Material Upon Which the
President Formed Some
Views.
Settlement of the Long- Protracted
Dispute on the Venezuelan
Boundary.
An Interesting Review of the Strug
gle of Cuban Insurgents for
Independence.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 7.â The re
ort of the Secretary of State to which
Cleveland refers in his message to Con
gress states that "the relations of tbe
United States with foreign powers con
tinue upon that footing of harmony and
friendliness which has been their fortu
nate characteristic for so many years.' 1
The report summarizes the more im
portant questions which have occupied
the attention of the department during
the current year. Of the dispute between
Great Britain and Venezuela it says:
The long-protracted dispute between Great
Britain anJ Venezuela over the boundary be
tween the latter republic and British Guiana
has for a number of years pnst attracted the
earnest attention of this Government and en
listed its official intervention to bring about a
peaceful settlement by the historical record
and the actual facts. The extended discussion
of the subject culminated in July of last year
by an elaborate presentation to the British
Government of the views of the United States,
touching the opportuneness and necessity for
a final disposition of the points at issue by the
pacific resort of an equitable arbitration.
The entire correspondence having been laid
before OongresÃ with his message of December
17, 1895, that body provided for the appoint
ment of a commission of eminent jurists to
examine and report touching the ascertaina
be iacts of tne controversy with a view of
enabling this Government to determine its
further course in the matter.
The commission has pursued its labors un
remittingly during the past year, its re
searches being greatly aided by the elaborate
statements placed at its disposal by both in
terested governments, together with a mass of
documentary evidence furnished from the
archives of the European countries that
shared in the early discoveries ana settlement
cf South America.
Pending this arduous investigation, how
ever, the governments of the United States
and Great Britain have omitted no endeavor
to a friendly understanding upon the main
issue through diplomatic negotiations, and it
is most gratifying to announce that amicable
councils have prevailed to induce a satisfac
tory settlement whereby the boundary ques
tion ami its associate' disputes have been
eliminated as between mis country and
Engla: d.
A complete accord has been reached between
them by which tht: substantial terms of a
treaty of arbitration to be concluded by Great
Britain and Venezuela have been agreed upon,
the provisions of which embrace a full arbi
tration ot the whole controversy upon basis
alike juÂ§: and honorable to both the contest
arts.
It only remains for the two parties directly
concerned to complete this equitable ar
rangement by siKiiine the proposed formal
treaty, und no doubt Is entertained that Yen
Â« zuelu, which so earnestly sought the friendly
assistance of the United States toward the
settlement of this contention and which has
ccufided its interests to the impartial j;idg
sntnt of this Government, will assent to the
formal adjustment thus attained, forever end
ing a dispute involving fur-reach injr conse
quunces to the peace and welfare of the West
ern continent.
Coincidentally with the consideration of
the Venezuelan question the two Govern
ments have continued negotiations for a
general arbitration treaty in line with the
British House of Commons, to which previous
messau-es of the President have adverted, that
all differences hereafter arising between the
two counties and not amenable to ordinary
diplomatic treatments should De relerred to
arbitration.
The United States and Great Britain having
given repeated proofs of their acqui
escence to the geat principle evolved, not
only by treaties between tl.emselves but sev
erally, by concluding like adjustments with
other powers for the adjudication of disputes
resting on law a"nd fact, tue subject was nat
urally approached in a benevolent spir:t of
agreement, and the negotiations have so satis
factorily progressed as to foreshadow a prac
tical agreement at an early date upon the text
of a convention to the desireci end.
Under the head of Spain, the Secretary
in his accompanyine report, which is, of
course, indorsed by the Presideut, speaks
of tbe Cuban situation as follows:
The situation in the island of Cuba has
largely engrossed the attention of the Depart
ment of State during the past year. Its efforts
to oDtain trustworthy information and to
insure due protection to citizens of
the United States and their property and in
terests within the theater of disturbance have
been ably â¢econdod by the consular represen
tatives in that island. As regards the char
acter Â»na scope of the hostile operations which
now affect the greater port of Cuba, the reports
of our Consuls are proierly confidential, and
while precise as to the several districts touching
â which reports have bi-en received, the nature
and sources of the information obtained are
such as to make detailed publication imprac
ticable, so that the department is not in a po
sition to do more at present than state its gen
eral deductions us to the position of the con
tending parties.
Confined in the outset, as in the ten years'
insurrection which began at Yara in October,
1868, to the eastern portion of the island,
where the topography an<l absence of settled
centers especially favored the desultory war
fare apparently normal to this class of con
tests, the present insurrection early took pro
portions beside those of its predecessors and
therewith assumed an aggressive phase, invad
ing the populous central and western districts.
Passing the defensive lines, or trocha, trav
ersing the island from north to south, formid
able bodies of the revolutionary forces early
in the year established themselves in tht rich
sugar-planting districts of Santa Clara, Cien
fuegos and Matanzas made hostile forays
almost in sight of Havana itself, and, advanc
ing westward, effected a Rtronehold in the fer
tile fields of Pinar del Rio, which basso fur
resisted all efforts of the Spanish forces to
overcome.
No prominent seaport has been attacked by
the insurgents or even menaced beyond oc
casional raids upon the outskirts. 'A large
part of the 2200 miles of the irregular coast
line of Culm, comprising the comparatively
unsettled stretches of its western extremity
and the inhospitable mountain Bhoros of its
eastern part, is.prdcfically in the hands of the
revolutionists.
The charae'er of these shores, filled to the
westward with shallow indentations inaccessi
ble to any but light vessels ot small tonnage
and to tho eastward with rocky nooks danger
ous to approach by night 'and affording
insecure anchorage for larger craft, lends
Itself peculiarly to Ihe guerrilla war
fare of the Interior, so that the insurgents,
being relieved ot the need of msintaininjr and
parrisoninp points upon the coast, are effec
tively able to utilize a (onsiderÃble part of it,
as occasion offers, to communicate with the
outside world and to receive clandestine sud
plies of men, arms mid Ammunition.
The situation in that quarter as regards the
ease of snrr..ptitiou-Â» access and the difficulty
of repressing illicit traffic finds a not unapt
parallel in that of the Cornish ami Welsh
coasts of English or the Scottish highlands
lÂ«8t century, where a few adventurers wire
able to smuggle fiiivt>liÂ» s and land rebel emis
saries or forces bf filing the watchers of mari
time forces much greater thun those main
tained by Spaia along the diversified shores of
Cuba.
"While thus in fact controlling the greater
part of the internal area of the whoie island
of Cuba from Cape San Antonio to Cape Maysl
and enjoying practically unlimited use of an
equally large part of tl.e coast, the revolution
ary forces are scattering, being nowhere for
any length of time to form an army capable of
attack and siege and fit to take the defensive
in h pitched battle.
Assembling suddenly at a eiven point, often
in a single night, they make unexpected
sallies or carry devastation to the tooacco and
rine fields of Cub., and at the first sign of
pursuit or organized assault they disperse.
only to reassemble in like manner at some
other spot.
So far as our information shows there Is not
only no effective local government by ihe in
surgents in the territories they overrun, but
there is uot even a tangible preteuse to estab
lished administration anywhere. Their or
ganization, confined to shifting exigencies of
the military operation! of the hour, is no
madic, without definite centers and lacking
the most elementary features of municipal
government.
There nowhere appears the nucleus of state
hood. Tne machinery (or exercising the legiti
mate rights and powers of sovereignty and re
sponding to the obligations which de facto
sovereignty entails iv the face of equal rights
of other states is conspicuously lacking.
It is not possible to diocern a homogeneous
political entity, possessing and exercising the
functions of administration and capable, if
left to itself, of maintaining orderly govern
ment in its owu territory and sustaining
normal relations wiih the external family of
governments.
To illustrate these conditions the insurgent
chiefs assert the military power to compel
peaceable citizens of the United States within
their touch to desist .from planting or grinding
cane under the decreed penalty ot death and
of the destruction of their crops and mills;
but the measure is one of sheer force without
justification under public law.
The wrongs so committed against the citi
zens oi a foreign state are without an interna
tional forum oi redress to whom the Govern
ment of the United States may have recourse
as regards its relation to the perpetrators. The
aits aro those of anarchy, and in default of
the responsibilities of de facto statehood in the
case there remains only the territorial ac
countability of the titular sovereign within
the limits of its competency to repress the
wrongs complained of.
In opposition to the nomadic control of the
interior and the undefended coast by the in
surgents the Spanish authority continues in
the capital cities and the seaports. Its garri
sons are there established; from them its
naval operations ar? directed ai.d executed.
Most of its functions proceed as iv time of
peace.
It* customs and municipal revenues are
regularly collected, and, with exception of the
temporary restraints alleged to be due to tbe
admitted existence of r state of hostilities, for
tiun commerce with the island is kept up, al
though largely diminished by the natural con
traction of the Cuban market of supply and
demand.
As to those parts of the island with which
this country and its citizens maintain inter
course, the Spanish power is supreme, although
often exercised in a vexatious and arbitrary
way, calling for just remonstrance. So far
therefore as the relative position of the Spanish
audinsureent forces is comparable with the sit
uation during the Yara insurrection. while the
same phases of organized administration in
the capital and seaports und eflective relations
of trade with the outside world on the one
hand, and on the other a nomadic association
without tha insignia of orderly government,
and strong only to wage harassing warfare in
the in-.erior, are now as then, apparent, the
present insurrection stands in notable con
trast with Us predecessors, both as to force
and scale of operations.
Although statistics of their military strength
are attainable with difficulty, and are not
trustworthy when obtained, enough is cer
tniuly known to show that the revolutionists
in the field greatly exceed in numbers any
organization heretofore attempted; that with
large accessions from the central and western
districts of the island a better military disci
pline is added to increased Btrength; that in
stead of mainly drawing, as heretofore, upon
the comparatively primitive population of
eastern Cuba, the insurgent armies fairly rep
resent the intelligent aspirations of a large
proportion of the people of the whole island,
ana that they proDOse to wage this contest on
these better grounds of vantage, to the end t?o
make tne present struggle a supreme test of
the capacity of tne Cubun people to win them
s-lves and their children the heritage of self
government.
A notable feature of the actual situation ii the
tactical skill displayed Dy its leaders. When
the disparity In numbers and the compara
tively indefensible character of the central
and western country ore considered, the pas
sage of a considerable force into Pinar del Rio
followed by its successful maintenance there
ior many months must be regarded as a mili
tary success of â¢ pronounced character.
So, too, the Spanish force in the field, in gar
rison on the island, or on its way thither from
the mother country, is largely beyond any
riiilitary display yet called ior by a Cuban
rising, thus affording an independent measure
of the strength ol the insurrection.
From every accessible indication it is clear
that the present rebellion is on a far more
formidable scule as to numbers, intelligence
and representative features than ntiy of tne
preceding revolts of this century; tnat the
corresponding -H'ort of t^pain for its repression
has been enormously augmented; and that
despite the constant:' influx o: fresh nrmies
and material of war from the metronolis the
rebellion after nearly two years of successful
resistance appears to-dny to be in a condition to
indefinitely prolong the contest on its present
lines.
The nature of the struggle, however, de
serves most earnest consideration. The in
creased settle on which it is waged brings into
bo.der relief 8l! the appalling phases which
often appear to mart contents for supremacy
among the Latin rnces of the western l.erai
spht-re. Excesses before confined to a portion
of the island became more impressive when
wrought throughout its whole extent as now.
The insurgent authority, in has been seen,
finds no regular admini.stra.tive expression; it
is asserted only by the sporadic and irre
sponsible force of arms. The Spanish power
outside of the larger towns and their imme
diate suburbs, when manifested at all, is
equally foreeiu'; and arbitrary.
The only apparent aim on either side is to
cripple tho adversary by indiscriminate de
struction of all that by any chance may bene
fit him. The populous and wealthy districts
of the center and west which have esciped
harm in former occasions ore new ravaged
and laid waste by the blind fury of the respec
tive partisans.
The principles of civilized warfare, accord
ing to the code made sacred by the universal
acquiescence of Nations, are only too often
vio.ated with impunity by irresponsible su
bordinates, scting at a distance from the cen
tral authority and able to shield themse'ives
from jus; censure or punishment by false or
fals;li-d versions of the lacts.
Tlie killing and summary execution of non
combatants is frequently reported, and while
the circumstances of the strife are such as to
preclude accurate or general iuformaiion in
this regard enough is known to show tnat tne
number of such cas-s is considerable. In
some instances, happiiv, few Americans navo
fallen victims to these savage acts.
A large part of the correspondence of the
State Department with its agents iv Cuba htts
been devoted to these cases of aisseult upon
the rights of our citizens. In do instance has
earnest remonstrance and energetic appeal
been omitted. But the reports of the Spanish
power often find it easily practicable to post
pone explanations and reparation on the
ground of alleged ignorance of facts for other
plausible reasons.
Its effect upon the personal security of our
citizens in Cuba is not the only alarming
feature of the reign of arbitrary anarchy in
that island. Vb influence upon the fortunes
of those who liÂ»ve invested their capital and
enterprise there, on the assumed assurance of
respect for law and treaty rights is no less in
point.
Exact statistic* of the amount of such in
vestments are not obtainaole. A gross esti
mate of $50,000,000 would cc more likely to
fall under iii an over the mark. A large pro
portion of these investments are now exposed
to the exceptional vicissitudes of the war.
Estates have been desolnted and crops de
stroyed by tne insurgents and Spanish alike.
Upon those not actually ravaged operations
have been compuUorily suspeurtcl, owing to
the warnings served by the' revolutionists or
the withdrawal of protection by Spanish au
thorities, oiten accompanied by a similar
prohibition against continuing work tnereon
or by forbidding communication and resi
dence, thus entailing enforced abandonment
of the premises.
The loss does not fall upon capital alone, but
largti numbers of the agricultural laboring
c!bhÂ» are driven from fields to the nearest
town?, partly by the peremptory orders of the
local military commanders and partly by the
cessation or destruction of their only means
of livelihood. They are well nigh destitute.
Among them are many sons of the United
Suites.
It is reported that thero are in one provin
cial city alone some 4ooo necessitous refugees
from the surrounding country to whom the
municipal authorities can afford little or no
relief. Over 300 of these are American citi
zens, engaged iv prosperous farming and stock
raising al the beginning of the outbreak,
whose employment and resources have been
swept away by eightean months of c-vil strife,
reducing them iroin affluence to penury and
throwing them upon me charity ot an ex
hausted cominuni'y In a devastated land.
All these disastrous conditions, with the
evils and disorders necessarily following in
their train, are interierluc with the insular
avenues oi trade and very gravely impairing
the business operations of Cuba.
From whatever point of view we regard the
matter it is impossible not to discern tbat a
state of things exists at our door alike danger
ous to good relations, destructive of legiti
mate commerce, fatal to tne internal
resources of Cuba and most vexatious
and trying because entailing upon this Gov
ernment excessive burdens in its domestic
administration and its outward relations.
Thiri situation cannot indefinitely continue
without growing still worse, and the time
limy not be far distant when the United States
must seriously consider whether its rights and
interests, as well as its international duties, in
view of Us peculiar r -latiens to the island, do
not call for some decided change in the policy
hitherto pursued.
Mr. Oiney, mentioning that tbe right of
every citizen arrested in Cuba to have the
benefit of ordinary criminal proceedings
guaranteed by existing treaties has bf>Â«n
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896.
energetically insisted upon, refers to the
ship Competitor affair as follows:
In April last the Competitor, a small
schooner of American registry, eluded the
vigilance of the Federal authorities, took on
board men and supplies, presumably intended
to aid the Cub&u insurrection, and reached
the coast of that island near Ban Cayetano.
Being discovered by the Spanish coastguard a
conflict ensued, resulting in the capture of a
number of those on board, as well as tne
seizure of the vessel.
The prisoners, among them several Ameri
can citizens, were subjected to summary mili
tary trial, which, although conducted by an
admiralty court, adjudged to be competent,
appeared' to have lacked the essential safe
guards of procedure stipulated by the existing
conventions between the United States ana
This Government promptly interfered to se
cure for its implicated citizens all the rights
to which they were clearly entitled, including
appeal from the pronounced sentenceof death.
Their cases were subsequently carried to the
higher tribunal at Maarid, which has set the
conviction aside and remanded the cases for
retrial.
This Government has been constrained to
enter earnest protest against a recent decree
of the Governor-General of Cuba ordering the
registration of all aliens iv the island and pro
nouncing all those not registered within a
certain time as debarred from appealing to the
provisions of existing law.
The treaty rights of American- citizens
obviously depend on their actual allegiance to
their own Government, not upon any arbitrary
inscription as aliens, by the state wherein
they may be sojourning; and while this Gov
ernment is well disposed to admit the
convenience of the proposed registry
as an additional evidence of the
right of such citizens in Cuba to
tÂ«W protection of the authorities and has sig
nified its willingness to facillcate their recis
tration, it can never consent that the omission
of a merely local iormaiity can operate to out
law any person entitled to its protection as
citizens, or to abrogats the right to the orderly
resources of Spanish law solemnly guaranteed
to them by treaty.
In other portions of his report the Sec
retary refers to the arrests of naturalised
American citizens in Austria-Hungary,
and says that the pro ress made toward
the settlement of this question has
been most satisfactory. He refers
to the settlement of a Central Ameri
can Diet by the republics of
Honduras, Nicaragua and Salvador
adopting the name of Greater Republic of
Central America, and says as the exact in
terpretation and effect of the articles of
association between the three republics is
not yet fully apprehended, the action
necessary or proper to be taken in conse
quence thereof is still under consideration
by tne department. Neeotiation3 are still
in progress for the completion of the un
finished work of tbe Chilean claims com
mission.
He says: "Our relations with China
have been made more friendly by the
concession of American citizens of tbe
light to purchase landsâ a right hitherto
conceded to France."
In respect to the reimposition of ton
nage tax on German snipping, the report
says that after an investigation which
showed that port dues were being col
lected in German ports on every Ameri
can vessel, tbe United States Embassador
at Berlin was asked for an explanation
which when made was not deemed suffi
cient.
The report then refers to the fact that
the stringent measures adopted by Ger
many "on assumed grounds of public
health" against the importation of Amer
ican cattle and meat products have not
been ameliorated, bur on the contrary the
disposition of Germany to still further im
pede this legitimate traffic has been
evidenced by fresh restrictive measures.
The trouble with the New York Life In
surance is referred to and the statement is
added that "continuing endeavors have
been made to secure for American life in
surance companies doing business in
Prussia a hearing in remonstrance
against the restrictions sought to be im
posed upon them, and fair prospects exist
of the ultimate removal oi the interdic
tion."
In regard to the Samoan qnestion, Mr.
Olney makes no recommendation and
gives no intimation of any recent action
having been taken. He simply says:
Ihe Eituation in Samoa is ; radically the
same as stated in the last annuAl message of
tne President ana in his special communica
tion to the Senate of May, 1394.. A possibility
of more effective harmony in the irsular ad
ministration may be suggested by the resigna
tion of the president of tbe municipal council,
and the agreement of the three powers
upon his successor, another German subject.
Tiie CQief Justice of Bamoa has aiso re
signed, a; a as he is Â»n American citizen the
proposal of his successor will naturally fall to
the United State*, which noressarlly continues
to exercise all stipulated rights and duties
under the tri-partitt; general act and of Berlin
during the continuance of that compact, how
ever irksome and unnatural these rights and
duties may prove to be.
The rest of the report is occupied with
routine matters.
WESTERN MILEAGE BUREAU.
Special Meeting Called to Contidrr Inters,
changeable Ticket*.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 7.â The members
of the Western Mileage Bureau have b en
called to hold a special meeting to-mor
row, the question to be discussed and de
cided being the issue, of a 5000-mile inter
changeable ticket, good on ail lines in the
Western Passenger Association.
The Western roads have now a 2000-mile
ticket, but not interchangeable, and the
recent action of the central passenger com
mittee authorizing a 5000-mile inter
changeable ticket to be issued through a
bureau by a few assenting lines has
prompted" the call for to-morrow's meet
ing. In view of the cc-oieration of the
Pennsylvania and Ohio River lines it is
likely the Western roads will vote to adopt
the same kind of ticket.
St. Paul lines have asked their connec
tions east of this city if they will join
them in meeting the unexpected extension
of the Canadian excursion business, and
the Joint Traffic Association has also been
asked to authorize its road to meet the
rate, but as Boston and other larce cities
would be affected, it is not likely the sale
will be met.
DUPONT IS THE RACE.

Portfolio.- " r
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 7.â Joseph B.
Keeling of Indianapolis called on Major
McKinley to-night and discussed the
political situation in . Indiana . to some
extent. Mr. Keeling said the impression
seems to prevail that C. N. Fairbanks will
be elected to the United States Senate this
winter. . â¢ :
A new Cabinet possibility has swung
into view this evening. Tna name for
tbe first time on the tongue of tbe coterie
of official Cabinet-makers about Canton
and Cleveland is that of Colonel Henry
A. Dupont of Delaware. Said a friend of
his to-night; "Colonel Dupont would
make an excellent Secretary of War, ana
under certain contingencies may bo se
riously considered for the position. He
is a graduate of West Point, served with
distinction through the war, and is a
capable and highly successful man of af
fairs. He is in every way qualified for
this official position, and his appointment
would offend neither of the Republican
lactions in Delaware."

-*- dence of a weakness may mean the total collapse of all sexual and mental vk'orin a
few years." It is dangerous to treat this symptom with indifference, to suppose that it
means nothing. It means a great deal. It is the forewarning of complete exhaustion
that is coming. It tells of the result of past follies, excesses and over-exertion of
mental, physical or sexual powers. It means that you are beginning to fail, ana swift
is the course of destruction once started. Like the serpent's warning, it should urge
prompt action. Effective means of checking the waste and restoring the power lost
can be found in electricity. Vital force, animal magnetism, is infused into; the failing
nerves and organs from DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT. There are thousands of
vigorous men to-day who owe their recovery solely to Dr. Sanden's Belt. It gives
steady, soothing currents of electricity into the weak parts, reviving the vital powers
and restoring a healthy and vigorous manhood. '.

MAJOR TAUSCH
GOES TO JAIL
Joins the German Scribes
in the Notorious
Scandal.
Ordered Into Custody on the
Evidence Show ng Him to
Bs Imp icated-
All Five Editors Accused of Libel
Are Convicted and Prompt y
Sentenced.
BERLIN, Germany, Dec 7.â The trial
of the five editors, Baron yon Luetzow and
Herren Pleetz, Berger, Foellmar and
Leckert. for libeling Baron Marshall yon
Bieberstein, Count August vun Eulenberg
and Prince Alex yon Hohenlohe, was re
sumed this morning.
Herr Levisohi, a member of theeditorial
staff of the Berlin Tageblatt, was called to
the stand and testified that a certain
article published in the Tageblatt casting
serious reflections upon Baron Marschall
yon Bieberstein had been personally in
fluenced by Major Tausch, the leader of
political police.
Upon the strength of this testimony the
jury ordered the arrest of Tausch, who
was in court, upon a charge of perjury,
and he was at once taken into custody
and conveyed to jail.
Count Philip Zu Eulenberg. German
Embassador to Austria, who arrived in
Berlin yesterday for the purpose
of appearing as a witness, was
called to the stand. He said that
he had learned to know Maj t
yon Tausch ciuiing the visit of the Kaiser
to Abazzin and had afterward proposed
Tausch as deserving of a decoration. Wit
ness said that he had received a letter
from Tau3Ch which, as it was of no im
portance, he haa destroyed. Count Eulen
berg said that he had never b' en con
nected witli any intrigues against Freiherr
Marschall yon Bieberstein, and knew
absolutely nothing about the existence of
any intrigues against him.
A motion was made by the public prose
cutor that in view of tbe confession of
Baron Lctzow, in which he slated Herr
Leckert supplied the material for the ar
ticle against Count Botho yon Eulenberg,
Leckert alleging that Baron Marschall
yon Bieborstein, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, inspired the article, Baron yon Lue
bow aud Herr Leckert be declared guilty
and sentenced to eighteen months' im
prisonment each. The court retired to
consider the motion.
When the court returned it announced
that a decision had been arrived at in re
spect to all of the prisoners. All but one
of them were fonnd guilty. Yon Luetzow
and Leckert were sentenced to eighteen
months' imprisonment each. Berger was
condemned to be confined for one month.
Pioetz was fined 500 murks and Foellmar
300 marks. Leckert's father wa.i also ac
cused, but nothing was proved against
him, and he was discharged.

GOT "PINK EYE?"
The Latest Name for BaJf
Habits That Are
Fashionable.
PUHABIOmWiBUSYI
That Is Quite Different From
the Fashionable Thing â
It's Serious.
From lime to time there appears a dif
ferent fad which is elevated to the name
of a disease by those who have nothing
better to amuse themselves with than
making excuses for their somewhat
"ragged" appearance, caused by late
hours, looking at the wine when they are
sober enough to see it (the color that it is
when it is in the cup is not a matter of
moment), and doing other naughtyâ very
naughtyâ and foolish things. But then
as long as there is temptation so long will
some people give way to it, and then â
why, of course they have got to find an
excuse for the result of what the cattle
man calls "Nose Paint" and other things.
Just now "Pink Eye" is the proper thing
to have, and if you haven't got it you are
not in fashion. Watch the clubman with
his eye on his matutinal cocktail as the
knight of the white apron and the curved
spoon is trying to make it to exactly tic^slÂ«
his pala:e. He evidently needs itâ -J
he's absolutely impatient to get Â»t mi.
Down it goes with a "Ha!" A eluwi
drops in and remarks that he looks "a
trifle under the weather," and your inno
cent clubmim wtll remark as sagely as
possible, "Yes, I've got just a touch of
Pink Eye, I think." And then he will
add seriously enough, "Quite prevalent,
you Know, just now â very nasty thing."
And so it is. The amount of Pink Eye
thai there was in town for two or tnree
days after election was simply appalling!
However, it is, perhaps, not well to treat
this matter with too much levity, for
tiiere 13 a time when another kind of pink,
or rather red, eye is a matter for very
serious consideration. This has been as
serted by a large number of eminent med
ical practitioners, and indeed the learned
physician who treats more severe cases of
nervous and general debility than any
one else in the city said with reference to
the matter a couple of days ago, "There
are occasions when red eyes, as most,
people call them, accompanied with a
feeling of prostration, a desire to do nÂ«
work, and melancholia and night sweats,
may surely Indicate a very dangerous con
dition of the bonly force" whicL has ended
in complete collapse." Thislwas no less a
gentleman than' the Chief Consulting
Physician of the famous |Hudson Medical
Institute, sum in their great white estab
lishment at the junction of Market, Stock
ton and Ellis streets they have had an
immense amount of experience with both
"Pink Eye" and the serious Kind. Asked
what was j.>ood for the fashionable disease,
the great specialist said: "To find out
what class of disease causes it. If it is
mere social cups simple remedies are ap
plied, but I have fou .d many people who,
on the verge of most complicated nervous
diseases, go on imagining ttiat there la
little, if anything, the matter with them
because they have managed to eet their
systems stimulated for a little while. But
eve;, in the worst of tiiereâ yes, I may say
in the very worst â our remedio-treatment
'Hudyan,' which is vegetable and purely
i.armleb^, rapidly stops the weakening pro
cess ana stops the farther spread ot disease.
Although blood poisoning of some kir.ds
is clearly shown at times by the peculiar
color of the eyes, I have seen 'Hiulyau' ,

continued, "they will, I am sur^, g.veyoT
someprintt d mailer which will give you full
particulars as to what I have been talking
about." The request for further informa
tion in the large front office was promptly
acce ded to, and an immense number of
most positive testimonials as to the value
of this remarkable remedy in liver and
kidney troubles, as well as nervous debil
itation was exhibited witb. much cordial
ity. "May I take one of these ?" queried
the reporter. "Certainly, tafce whatever
you want; we are glad to send circulars
and testimonials of 'Hudyan' to any one
who cares to call or write to us for them,"
was the kin i reply, and with that the in
terview ended.

People of a Mexican City-
Scourged by a Stranga
Disease.
Medical Men Fail to Relieve
the Sufferings of the
A fl.cted.
Many Have Succumbed and the Spread
cf the Malady Cannot Bj
Checked.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec 7.â A strange
malady has broken out among the lower
classes in the city of Cuilpancingo, 'Mex
ico, the capital of the State of Guerrero.
Doctors of the city have been entirely baf
fled in their diagnosis and are powerless
to alleviate the suffering or to prevent the
spread of the disease, whica has proven
fatal in a large proportion of the cases.
The symptoms are described to bealnn
guour, followed by the appearance of a
bright yellow button upon the forehead,
deathly sickness and vomiting, accompa
nied by exhaustion and collapse. T.':e dis
ease i& not allied to yellow fever, accord
ing to the physicians, and its symptoms
more nearly approach the mysterious
malady known in Asia Minor than any
other.
It is stated that the people of Aleppo, |
Asia Minor, are attacked by the disease !
daring th eir lifetime, and all new comers (
to the city are attacked within a few
days, but the d.sease, curious as it is. is
rarely ever fatal in the far east. In Mex
ico it assumes a malignant phase, and the {
State and National Boards of Health are j
bestowing much attention upon it. Dr.
Demttrio Mejia of the City of Mexico
Board of Health recently visited Chilpan
cingo to investigate the epidemic.
OFOLOBAXPO * CHE MB FAILS.
Mexican Government Revoke* Albert K.
Vict-n'.m Concession.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 7.â The Mexi
can Government has revoked the conces- '
sion granted in February, 1890, to Albert ;
K. Owen for lands in the State of Sinaloa, j
bordering on the Topolobampo Bay.
It was on this land that Owen estab
lished his famous colony, and for eight
years he tried hard to make it a success, j
following out the dreams of Bellamy and
other socialists. The colony thrived for a
time on the money derived from new ar
rivals, but for the past five years it has i
been declining, and all the efforts of Owen
ann his fellow-enthusiasts have been fruit
ier.
Owen agreed to build a railroad from
Topolobampo Bay into Chihuahua, pars
ing through the States of Sina'oa, Sonora,
Cii liuahuii and Coahui-a.and was granted
a large tract of land on condition that he
would survey the public lands in that |
vicinity. But he failed to do so, as well as j
failing to settle 500 families on the lands
within two years, as required by his con- !
tract, after giving him four years of j
grace the Mexican department of coioni- j
nation and public works nas declared his
concession forfeited.

SUED BY A SAN JOSE WOMAN.
George Damron, a San Francisco Real
Estate Broker, Accused of
Defrauding.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 7.â Mrj. Pauline
P. Wardell to-day began a su;t in the Su
perior Court against George Damron, a
real estate broker of San Francisco, to
have a deed executed by her last Satur
day, by which she transferred two lots in
the Hulet subdivision, valued at about
$3000, set aside on tne ground that it was
ob' ained through fraud.
Mrs. Wardell charges that Damron and
a stranger, whose name is unknown, con
spired to defraud her out of her property.
She says the two men called upon her and
wanted to buy her property. They pro
posed assigning to her a noie of $4000 and
a mort-age securing it, which Damron
held by assignment from the payee,
Joanna Bryant, and which had been exe
cuted by George J. Grilling involving the
ownership of a third interest of a six
teenth interest in 1U.587 acres of land In
Sonoma County for the two lots, which
are valued at nearly $5000, but subject to
a $1200 mortgage, fbey represented that
$1000 had been paid uuon the mortgage,
but that the land which the mortgagb was
upon was worth $12,000.
Believing these statements to be true,
Mrs. Waroell accet ted the not-- and mort
gage in traue lor her lots, and without in
vestigation deeded the property to Dam
ron.
On Sunday night she learned that the
mortgaged security traded to him was of
no value and that the maker of the note
was insolvent. It was further learned
nothing had been paid on the note at all
a:.d the plaintiff was designedly cheated
and defrauded. Fearing that Damron
might convey the prop?rty to some one
else, a lis pendens has> been filed with the
Coumy Recorder.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896.
ONCE A SEATTLE
SOCIETY BELLE
Career of Lizzie Emerson,
the San Francisco
Suicide.
Deserted Her Husband and Child
and Fled From a Happy
Home.
After Repentancs Cams a Longing
for Eternal Rest in the
â  Grave.
SEATTLE, Wash, Dec. 7.-The|hand
some young woman who committed sui
cide in San Francisco Saturday night,
eiving her name as Lizzie Emerson and
stating that her husband had been dead
several months, was Mrs. Elmer Jndkin
of this city. Her husband is alive, and
yesterday he received the news of her
death. Sbe was well connected in this
city, and though she 'had passed out of the
lives of the respectable people who knew
her the announcement of her death created
much talk here, where she was so well
known.
During Mrs. Judkin's career in this city
she filled the role of a society woman and
of a fallen woman. She was reared in
Seattle and was known for her remarkable
beauty and cleverness. She married El
mer Judkin about five years ago. Judkin
is a photographer. His people own half
of North Seattle. The two were happy for
a long time. One child was born â a
daughter. The woman figured in society
and because of her cleverness and fine face
received mucb attention. She came to
the conclusion one day, according to those
who knew her well, that society was a
farce. Within a week she had left her
husband.
Soon afterward sbe met a man named
"Jack" Donahue, a bartender, and fell in
love with him. Her husband tried to in
duce her to return to him. She laughed
at him, but always claimed that she loved
her child as much as on the day it was
born. Donahue fell a victim to consump
tion and had to so to California for bis
health. The woman followed him, turn
ing her bouse and its valuable contents
over to a friend. Donahue and the woman
made San Francisco tfteir home.
Six months ago Donahue died and since
then Mrs. Judkin, according to letters
written to friends in this city, was a
changed woman. Her husband had never
| secured a divorce from her. He was will
ing, it is said, to take her back, but sbe
would notconr.e, though in poverty. Sui
cide was all that was left for her, and as
her foi mer friends expected, she took ad
vantage of it. She took the name of
Lizzie Emerson alter leaving her husband
and was ever afterward known by that
name.
Her husband in answer to telegrams
from San Francisco arranged to-day to
have her buried in that city.
PLAYED POKER AT PORTLAND.
Haying' Lost Several Thousand Dollars
Young Seymour Risdon Attempts
Suicide.
PORTLAND, Ob., Dec. 7.â Beymour
Risdon, a young man of 25 years, who is
a member of a wealthy family in Hart
tord, Conn., has succeeded in making a
laughing stock of himself among Port
land's gilded youths.
This evening's Telegram says he came
to this city three weeks ago from San
Francisco, after sojourning there for six
months looking after certain interests for
his father. He at once entered a swell set,
and last Friday night he, with three
others, engaged in a poker game in a well
appointed room in the Marquam building.
Early Saturday mornine he had trans
ferred $8500 of his bank account to his
companion?.
Dejected and desperate Risdon drew a
pistol to sboot himself. One ot the other
young men quickly snatched it from his
hand, thereby averting a scandal that
would have involved the names of several
respectable families here. Failing in the
attempt to take his life tne heavy loser
accused his companions of having robbed
him.
He escaped punishment for this accusa
tion by reason of his suffering from undue
excitement and the absorption of much
wine.
On Saturday morning one of the winners
presented young Mr. Risdon's checks at
his bank of deposit, but the loser had fore
stalled him by drawing out his money.
Two of the winners at once consulted a
lawyer, and he advised them thatit would
be very difficult to collect the money.
During that afternoon the youn^ man
from Hartford commissioned an old
friend of his father to enter in:o negotia
tions for a compromise. Thin resulted in
the winners "knocking off " 75 per cent of
their dues.
CTAR'S ELECTION MUDDLE.
Official < anrass of the Tote Prevented by
an Injunction.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 7.â The State
Board of Canvassers m<st this morning to
canvass the votes cast at tne recent elec
tion. It was at once en joined by the State
Supreme Court from making the canvass
or issuing the certificates of election to
the successful candidates.
The injunction was issued on the peti
tion of M. L. Ritchie, one of the Judges of
the Third Judicial District, who alleges
that the election held on November 3ij
null for the reason that the aci of
Legislature authorizing it was not legally
passed and the ballot was not secret, as,
according to the constitution, it ought to
have been. He claimed the entire elec
tion was void and that the present State
and county oflicers held over until the
next regular election.
Tne hearing of arguments on the peti
tion is tet for Friday next, when it will be
decided whether or not the injunction
will be made permanent. Senator Arthur
Brown is the leading counsel for the peti
tioners.
GOES TO SAN QUANTIN
The Xotoriou* Butler Stiller Sentenced
for Abduction.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Dec. 7.â
Judge Cope of the Superior Court to-day
sentenced Frank Miller to serve five years
at San Quentin for the abduction of Hattie
Abnor, a 13-year-old girl, from San Pedro.
Miller will be remembered as the butler
wlio killed a man in J. L. Franklin's
house on California street, San Francisco,
last spring, which homicide the police
tried to prove was premeditated murder to
cain notoiiety and reward for vigilance
from his employer.
Shasta Without a Treasurer.
REDDING, Cal., Dec. 9.â W. A. Smith,
who was appointed by the Board of Super
visors to succed "Watchdog" Jackson as
Treasurer of Shasta County, has not been
able to complete his bond; consequently
the S erift has been obliged to attend to
all the tax collecting of late. Smith's
failure causes no reflection upon that gen
tleman's integrity, but indicates that Jack
son's defalcation has rendered business
men wary in the matter of signing bonds.
JAILED AT SANTA BARBARA.
Harry Miller, the Youthful Driver Who
Robbed His Own Stags, Con
fesses.
FANTA BARBARA, Cal., Dec. 7.â
Harry Miller, the boy driver who robbed
his own stage between Los Alamos and
Lompoo Friday night, arrived here last
night in charge of Sheriff Hicks. The
Sheriff on being notified of the robbery
had started for Lorapoc, arriving there
Sunday morning at 6 o'clock.
After consulting with the local officers
ho soon came to the conclusion that the
driver was the aruilty one. At first the
boy stoutly denied the charge, but the
Sheriff told him he had documpntary evi
dence against him. Then Harry con
fessed.
He *aid that after he passed the Stuart
postoflice he put down hio hand and felt a
hole in the mailbag.
This excited his curiosity, and he pro
ceeded to extract one of the letters. Hav
ing drawn it from the sack, he rifled it.
This proceeding was so entertaining that
he continued his researches, but found
nothing of value bat a rubber stamp and
sotue dress goods in a registered package.
he then made a bonfire of the rifled mail
and registered wrappers, hiding the
stamp and dres* goods. These have since
been recovered by the oflicers.

STEAL TO GET TO RANDSBURG.
Eager Prospectors Ride to the â¢'Digging*"
on Other People* Hone*.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Dec. 7.â There
are said to be a large number of ownerless
horses trying to subsist on the scant vege
tation of the desert sands about the latest
El Dorado of the South Randsburg.
On the heels of the many "stray steeds"
stories from Randsburg comes the ex
planation. Scores of horses of the "sick
lier" sort have been confiscated from
corrals, lots nnd pastures In and abont
this city. Numerous complaints have
reached the police authorities within the
past few days respecting these thefts, but
no clews were forthcoming upon which to
work. All that the owners will have to
do now will be to go to Randsburg and
take their pick.
The excitement has been so great of late
and so much has been said of
the marvelous richness of the sand* about
the Johannesburg of California that the
temptation was great, and many a hungry
prospector and ambitious miner has rid
den away on some swift-footed Pegasus to
the land of promise. Of course, the
Police Department can do nothing, for the
jurisdiction of Chief Glass does not reach
to Randsburg.

ment at the west end of the Northern
Pacific bridge over Carbon River, on the
Doty branch, between Crocker and Car
bonade, was washed out during the floods
and thi? morning a freight train with nine
loaded cars dashed through into the water.
No lives were lost, the train crew jumping
before the river was reached. The train
was used to haul coal from the Carbon
Hill mines. A wrecking crew was sent
and the bridge will probably be repaired
within two days.
White River is still high, and the flood
renders the work of putting in a new
bridge between Seattle and Tacoma im
possible. Tne river subsided a foot last
nigh), and no more damage is expected.
A farmer in from the White River Val
ley to-day said hundreds of fsmisand
ranches around K"nt and Auburn suf
fered great loss.
AH transportation between Tacoma and
Seattle is done by boats and there will
probably be no trains this week. Cowlitz
River is over its banics south of hpre and

Portland train says he saw many sma'l
buildings floating away and in one or two
instances people were clinging to them.
The track to Portland is clear, despite sev
eral small landslides.
Puyallup River dropped five feet since
Friday and is now running quiet'y in the
new channel made by cutting off bends.
Canon's large orchard nÂ»ar Pnyallnp was

Appalling Damage by the Second Flood
Visitation in ihe Pacific North

SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 7.â From its
second flood visitation the Pacific-North
west is suffering to fully as great an ex
tent as it did irom the disastrous effects
of November's storms.
To-day the mad waters of many rivers
emptying into Pucet Sound .from the
north and east reached an appalling
height. All railroad bridges constructed
and trackage rebuilt during the Jatter
days of last month wÂ«>re again swept away
between Friday and Monday morning.
Between Snononalsh City and Everett,
Snohomisb River is six miles wide, 'ihe
Great Northern tracks between Sultan
City and Everett are inundated to a deptn
of from two to. five feet nnd three big
bridges over the Stykomish in the Cas
cades were swept away.
Skykomish River is a raging torrent,
running in many places like a millrace.
It is only with the greatest difficulty that
food supplies are gotten to Monte Cristo
and neighboring towns. Th# Everett and
Monte Cristo road is almost a total wreck.
In short, the story of 1 the flood's devas
tation in the valleys of the Snohomish,
Nooksak, Skagit, Siillaguamish, Sno
qualmie and Skykomish is but a repeti
tion of the harrowing tales of the fury of
the storms three or four weeks ago.
Near Seattle. In Ihe fertile vailevs of the

HOW ELEPHANTS CLIMB.
They Can Descend Declivities Where a
Mountain Mule Would Fall.
Elephants are able to make their way
up and down mountains and through a
country of steep cliffs, where mules would
not dare to vnture, and even where men
find passage difficult. Their tracks have
been found upon the very summits of
mountains over 7000 feet nigh. In these
journeys an elephant is often compelled
to descend hills and mountainsides which
are almost precipitous. This is the way it
is done: The elepliani's first maneuver is
to kneel down close to *.he declivity. One
forelejr is then cautiously parsed over t lie
edge and a short way down the siope, and
if he find there is no spot for a firm fqot
boid he speedily forms one by stamping
into the soil ii it is moist or kicking out a
footing if it is dry. When he is sure of a
good loothold the other foreleg is brought
down in the same way. Then he performs
the same work over again with his feet,
bringing both forelegs a little in advance
for '.he first hoothold. This leaves good
places already made for the Hind feet.
Now bracing himself up by bis huge
strom: f ielegs he draws his hind legs,
first one and then the other, carefully over
ihe edge, where they occupy the first
places made by the forefeet. This is the
way the huge animal proceeds all the
w;ty down, zigzag, kneeling with his fore
feet. Thus the center of gravity is pre
served and the huge beast prevented froni
toppling over on his nose. â Philadelphia

THE LOWEST DEEP OF SHAME.
Dean Swift once declared that he heard a woman of the London slums assert
in a quarrel with another: "1 admit that lam a bawd, a liar, a blackmailer, a
thief, a drunkard and a dirty wench; but otherwise I am as good a lady as
anybody." This story Bounds incredible, but it has just received in this
City a striking example of its probability. The San Francisco Examiner, under
the ownership of "Willie" Hearst, the editorial management of "Long Green"
Lawrence, and the pistol protection of Wyatt Earp, has made a declara
tion similar in every respect to that which Dean Swift claimed to have heard
from the depraved denizen of the London slums.
Oti Sunday and yesterday the Examiner published in a conspicuous place on
ils editorial page denunciations of its course and character by honest journals
in this City and in the interior of the State. It put before the public the con
tempt with which it is regarded by decent and reputable newspapers, and without
shame confessed its degradation, paraded its vileness, and impudently exulted in
the public knowledgo of its disgrace.
If the Examiner has concluded to parade all of its shame and the lull measure
of Its denunciation by the decent papers of the coast it wili have to give more space
than was accorded to the disgraceful recital on Sunday and yesterday. If it
wishes to show that it is truly abandoned in its shameleasness it should select
with more care the indictments of itself to which it gives space. What it has
printed thus far upon its own unworth is but mild in comparison with what has
been said of it. To give anything like a full and true record of public judgment
concerning itself the Examiner will have to omit its fakes, its indecencies and
its falsehoods ana devote all of its space to extracts from ,the editorial columns of
its contemporaries.
The Examiner has not gained its disgraceful reputation by doing nothing.
Neither has its proprietor, "Willie" Hearst, nor its editor, "Long Green," ac
quired the ill repute which they seem to enjoy among honest men without engag
ing in transactions the publication of which would make exactly that kind of
news in which the Examiner delights. If therefore it intends to parade its reputa
tion before the public as the latest sensation in the way of filth and deprav
ity it does not lack for means wherewith to do it. Let it reprint its recent
indecencies with the record and practices of the men who own and edit it, and
the exposition of its depravity as well as the reason for it will be complete.
For a long time vast the Examiner, its proprietor and its editor have been
engaged in indecent publications and practices which deserve the clutch of crini
inal law. They may with shameless exultation reproduce and mock at the
indignation of honesty, but they will hardly be so exultant when an outraged
penal statute reaches out its hand for them. This recourse is left therefore for
decency against the shameless emanations of decadent journalism, and it may
not be long be lore resort is made to it.
The press of the interior, which has joined with so many of the higher class
weeklies of this City to denounce the iniquity of the Examiner and to warn the
public against the debasing influences which emanate from it, may well be grati
fied with the result of their work. They have fought a good fight for clean jour
nalism, for decency, honesty and morality, and have achieved no slight success in
compelling the Examiner and its managers to recognize the force of their efforts by
an open admission of guilt.
We account the publication of these words of condemnation in the Examiner
of Sunday and yesterday as evidence that the good work of honest journalism in
denouncing*this journalistic fraud and faker has had no little effect. It is a no
table victory for decency that the Examiner has been at last compelled to virtually
reiterate the words of the drab of the London slums and admit that, while claim
ing to be as good a lady as anybody, it is in fact engaged in absolute and open
depravities, and that having abandoned decency and honor it has finally bidden
farewell to its own sense of self-respect. The pubiic parade of degradation is the
lowest deep of shame.
CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE.
The last messsge to Congress of Presi
dent Cleverand is as was expected a long
and elaborate review of all political issues
before the country. It is in many pas
sages wordy to theextentof being tedious.
It will, therefore, not receive the wide
spread reading which would otherwise be
sriven it, and this is to some extent to be
regretted, since it deserves the careful
study of the people.
On our foreign relations Mr. Cleveland
is as usual anything rather than vigorous.
He writes as one whose mind wanders
and who is incapable of decided action.
All that he can say is that the time will
probably come erelong when some action
concernin.- them will be necessary.
In regard to the Armenian troubles he
says: "I do not believe that the present
somber prospect of Turkey will be long
permitted to offend the sight of Christen
dom." Nevertheless, he adds that any
action at this time on our part would be
unadvisable, because it would be resented
by the Ottoman Government and be re-
garded as an interruption of their plans by
the great nations who assert their exclu
sive right to intervene in their own time
and method for the security of life and
property in that country.
Of Cuban affairs he writes at great
length, but after all reaches the conclu
sion that the time has not come for
American intervention. He suggests that
Spain should offer to Cuba a measure of
genuine home rule, and proposes that the
United States should act as a mediator to
that end. He finally concludes that it will
not be amiss to remind Congress that cir
cumstances may arise when a correct
policy and care for our interests will con
strain our Government to such action as
will subserve the interests thus involved
and secure to the people of Cuba an
opportunity to enjoy the blessings of
peace.
The President then enters upon a re
view of the consular service, the sealing
question, condition of the treasury, na
tional banks, immigration, life-savinÂ« ser
vice, military affairs, coast defenses, post
office, public lands, pensions, and arrives
at last to what may be regarded as the
more important passages of the message.
The firm of these passages in point of
interest to the Pacific Coast is that relat
jng to the debts of the Pacific railroads.
The President points out that these roads
are already in default to the Govern mem,
and are likely to be more so when the pay
meats come due on the Ist of January.
1897. He thereupon suggests foreclosure
by the Government.
The next passage in the message of note
is that mating the expected defense of the
Wilson tariff law. This is perhaps the
weakest portion of the message. His only
argument for the law is that during the last
fiscal year it has yielded nearly $8,000,000
more revenue than was received from the
tariff duties of the preceding year. He
admits there has been a deficit of about
$25,000,000, but nevertheless declares a be
lief that if the present law be allowed a
fair opportunity it will in the near future
yield a revenue which with reasonable
economical expenditures will overcome all
deficiencies.
Passing from thi3 subject to a consider
ation of the gold reserve, the President
declares that no deficit which has oc
curred or may occur need excite ordisturb
us. He maintains that the only evil in
our monetary policy is the greenbacks,
and says: "I am more convinced than
ever that we can have no assured financial
peace and safety until the Government
currency obligations upon . which gold
may bo demanded from the treasury are
withdrawn from circulation and can
celed."
The closing passage of the message deals
with the subject of trusts and monopolies,
and on this issue the President deals with
a directness and force which is in striking
contrast with the weakness he shows in
dealing with foreign affairs. He declares
that the failure of the administration to
enforce the anti-trust law 3 enacted by
Coneress has been due not to any lack of
disposition, "but simply because the laws
themselves as interpreted by the courts do
not reach the difficulty." He adds that if
the insufficiencies of existing laws can be
remedied by further legislation it should
be done, and moreover he suggests that
the several States should act in conjunc
tion with the Federal authorities to sup
press such organizations.
With a final plea for economy, Mr.
Cleveland closes his last message to Con
gress. It will be, as a whole, a disappoint
ment, not only to his friends, but t o the
people at large, who expected from him
something more depided than he has writ
ten.
Almost anythine goes as a novelty at
this season, but the public will draw the
line at the Presidential message.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896.
MARKETING TFRUIT.
We have reached the point in the devel
opment of the fruit industry in California
where more attention is being paid to the
marketing of the crop than to a considera
tion of tbe means of increasing it. It
seems indeed very clear that the industry
will increase of itself promptly enough as
fast as we can extend the markets in which
the crop can be profitably sold.
To provide for the better marketing of
the fruit many suggestions have been
i made. One of these is to enact a protec
tive tariff which will exclude foreign im
ports and secure the American market to
the home producer. This will be good in
itself, but will nol be sufficient. When we
have excluded the foreign importations
there will still remain to us the task of
! distributing our fruit throughout the
United States, by carrying it to the con
| sumer in an attractive form, and at prices
j which will place it within the reach of the
great majority of the American people.
During the nine months of this year it
is said that there were imported from
abroad fruits and nuts to the value of
more than $12,U52,0G0. It would be of great
advantage to Caiifornians to secure this
large revenue for themselves and it is
certainly worth their while to give serious
thought to every mea^Ds which may be
devised to obtain it. It is claimed by
some dealers that the low tariff is not the
sole reason whj so much foreign Jruit is
used in this country. They assert that the \
imported goods are packed so much more |
attractively than the American tnat they j
can be sold readily even at pi ices saf- j
ficiently higher than the home goods to
pay the extra cost which the customs duty
imposes upon them.
The facts contained in these statements
should be carefully investigated. If we
lose tbe home market for our fruit simply
because we do not' pack i; sufficiently well
to plea?e the consumer, then we are our
selves to blame for the loss. The work of
packing and preparing fruit for the mai
ket in California is in the hands of a much
higher class of labor than that which is
employed in Europe for the same purpose.
Our labor is intelligent, well educated and
neat. It is largely made up cj" young
women from our public schools, who are
quite capable of really artistic packing if
they are taught how to cio it and given
the time sufficient for careful work.
It is certain that tue time has gone by in
the United States when the consuming
pubiic would tako almost anything so
long as it was good, no matter in wliat
form it came. Our artistic cultivation has
been rapid in recent years, and as a people
we have attained a high degree of esthetic
culture. The popular taate at this time
demands that the eye sliall De pleased in
everything that is used about the home.
We must conform to that taste in preoar
ing our fruit for the market. It will be in
vain that we seek to exclude foreign goods
from the United States so Jong as we per
mit the foreigner to make his goods more
attractive to our people than our own.
THE BAYARD TESTIMONIAL.
Embassador Bayard lias shown such
lingering elements of common-sense as
remain to him by declining to be the re
cipient of the testimonial of British esteem
which the London Telegraph . proposed to
raise. He has" done many thincs during
his career in England which show the
weakness of an increasing old ape, but
had he been foolish enough to permit this
movement for a testimonial to po on, he
would have been excused for all that he
has done upon the ground that he has
sunk into a complete and imbecile dotage.
The London Telegraph makes a fake
feature by getting up some sort of sub
scription every silly season. These sub
scriptions are taken for whatever subject
happens at the time to be the prevailing
fad in London. Sometimes they tend to
a really benevolent object, but at other
times they are absolutely idiotic.
The fake of the Telegraph for this year
was to raise a subscription for the purpose
of buying an elaborate, beautiful and cost
ly edition of the works of Shakespeare for
Mr. Bayard, as an expression of Britisn
esteem for the manner in which he has
conducted himself in the high office of
Embassauor. The reason for taking up
this subscription is to be found in the
extremely subservient way in which Bay
ard has acted toward the British Queen,
London society and the aristocracy gen
erally during the whole of his residence
in that country. While, therefore, it
might have been a sincere tribute on the
part of the British, it certainly reflected
no credit on Mr. Bayard.
It is to be somewhat regretted that Mr.
Bayard considered the conventional rules
of courtesy bound him to decline the tes
timonial with an expression of thanks
instead of indignation. When rightly con
sidered a movement for such an object
coming from such a source was a direct
reflection upon the Embassador, if not in
the nature of an insult. There are few
men of dignity who would care to accept
testimonials faked up by newspaper sub
scriptions under any circumstances what
ever, and we can hardly conceive of nn
official of tjie American Government con
descending to accept one presented to him
in that way by the newspaper of a foreign
country to whose court he was sent for the
express purpose of guarding the interests
of the American people.
Mr. Bayard's refusal to accept the tes
timonial fortunately puts an end to what
threatened to be another disgraceful epi
sode in the career of the Cleveland admin
istration. The incident may now be con
sidered closed, but there will still be some
irritation in the remembrance that an
American Minister did so conduct himself
at the court of St. James that a London
newspaper had reason for believing that
he would accept a testimonial from it as
an expression of the grateful feelings of
the British people.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
George L. Fischer, agent of Coburn, Tevis &
Co., who recently visited Corinto and other
points along the Central American coast, hns
returned here from a trip to Stockton. Mr.
Fischer says, in reference to the account pub
lished of the beating of the Chileno, tne Colum
bian and the Salvadoran on November 7 last
off Corinto, that no indignity or insult was
inflicted upon him.
'â¢The commandantÂ© was a friend of mine," he
said, "and though I was at first stopped and
questioned by the soldiers, I moved on in the
throng and was not further interrupted. The
three men were taken off the American
steamer San Juan, not the San Jose. The
Salvadoran was returned to the ship and de
clared innocent. The Chileno and the Colum
biun were retained on shore. All were beaten
very severely. As stated, it was because a

drummer declared he had been robbed while
aboard of $200 or .Â«300 in American gold.
One of the men got 200 lashes and he still
declared his Innocence. Anotner got 150
lashes and the other 60 lashes.
"That is a method of punishment they have
down there, and, in a sense, I suppose they
have to adopt it, for they have a good many
tough natives to deal with. Few people know
what hard characters they are. The only ques
tion is about the ship when the vessel was not
in their waters or territory.
"The sticks with which the blows were in
flicted were some kind of tough wood which
grows there and which is slit at the end to
mnke a number of lashes. The sticks are each
about four end a half feet long, and only one
is used at a time, with which ten blows are
struck. Then it is cast aside and a new one
|aken up. The bugle blows while the strokes
are falling. One soldier strikes awhile and
then another, while the victim bend 3 over
a bench."
Mr. Fisher happened to have one of the
sticks. About a foot and a half of it had been
worn away while inflicting the ten blows.

Tocoh and Moveâ E. G. 8.. Liveraore, Cal.
According to the laws of draughts it is "touch

play, touches a piece, he must move it, unless
prior to touching it he intimates his inten

moved is touched there is no penalty.
Xokthwest Passageâ W. F. M., City. Sir
Robert McClure, who, in 1850, was captain of
the Investigator, was the first to achieve the
northwest passage. Although his ship was
abandoned he completed the voyage partly on
the ice and partly on a return vessel. The
discovery is not of any practical benefit, but
is the solution of a scientific problem.

Credit Mobilierâ F. A. X., Grass Valley,
Cal. The late James A. Garfield was not "con
j victed in the Credit Mobilier scandal." In
j the Presidential campaign the Democratic

SHE SAILED FROM
THE NAVY-YARD
Came Here Under Sail
With Captain Glass in
Command.
The Only Occasion on Which a
Warship Came Down With
out a Tow.
Liter News Frcm the Old-Time Dere
lict, Honresfeldâ Now in the
Atlantic.
The sinking of the battle-ship Texas
alongside the drydock has brought Cap
tain "Harry" Glass into prominence. He
is well known on the Pacific Coast and
not a man who served under him but
sympathizes with him in his trouble. It
is now over sixteen years ago since Cap
tain Glass was in command of the train
ing ship Jamestown. At that time the
vessel was on the Pacific Coast. While
Captain Glas3 was a rigid disciplinarian,
he was also one of the most kind-hearted
men in the fleot and all the officers and
men loved him.
Twice he sailed the Jamestown up to
Mare Island for repairs, but on only one
occasion did he attempt to sail her down.
The trip was a venturesome one as the
waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers make the current treacherous near
the junction. Nevertheless, Captain Glass
determined to save the United States a
tow and accordingly sailed the warship
down to port. All went well until after
I the "Sisters" were past and then the cap
i tain had a brush with "The Brothers."
His good ship held her way, however, in
spite of all obstacles and finally reached
tne open waters of the bay. The accom
panying picture is from an old sketch and
shows the Jamestown on the last tack for
a clear run.
On one occasion the Independence
â  sailed up to Mare Island, but Bhe never
I sailed back again, so the Jamestown can
I claim the honor of being the only United
States man-of-war that ever sailed tn rough
] the straits to the navy-yard and back
i a^ain. Captain Glass was complimented
I again and again upon the feat and in spite
i of the Texas affair he will always be re
j merubered among old sailors on this coast
! as the only man who ever brought a sloop
! of-war from Mare Island to San Francisco
under sail. Alter being detached from
the Jamestown Captain Glass was put in
charge of the equipment department at
Mare Island and later was made captain
of the yard. The Jamestown was ordered
to Newport, R. 1., and ever since has been
in use as a training-ship. She wfs built in
1855 in Gosport, Va., and is 163 feet 6
mcbes lonjr. 36 feet broad, and her gross
lonrfage is .1150.
Andrew Fnrnsetn, secretary of the
Coast Seamen's Union, started for the
East to-day to attend the annual conclave
of the American Federation of Labor at
Cincinnati. From there he will go to
Washington, and wilt look after the inter
ests of tne sailors in the next Congress.
Mr. Furuseth hopes that in time he will
secure some amendments to the Ma r 'uire
act that will materially assist the sailors.
After being many months in port the
captain of the Alice Knowles has suddenly
discovered that in latitude 9 north, longi-
Uide 175 east, he saw the derelict Honres
feld. 1 vis occurred on December 28, 13C5.
It was in February, 1893 that the stout
British ship was abandoned. While on
ncr way here with a cargo of coal the lat
ter took tire, and finally the crew, having
done everything in their power to put it
out, abandoned her. WhÂ»n the news
reached San Francisco tne big tug Fearless
was sent out to look for the derelict, but
failed to find it. Next the news came that
it was stranded on one of the South Sea
; coral islands, and that wa? the last heard
I from the derelict until Captain Ogden
made his report.
George McLane, the well-known freight
â  clerk on tne Pacific Mail dock, died yester
j day of dropsy. He was one of the best
; known of the old-time pursers on the
! front. For years he was in the employ of
the Mail company, and later transferred
his allegiance to the Oceanic (steamship
Company. While the Zjalandia was in
commission he ran between here and Aus
tralia, but when she was laid up be was
out of a job. Finally he took the position
of chief freight clerk on the Mail docK
and held it until the day of h?s death.
Georce McLane was a whole-souled gentle
man and made a host of friends while in
the employ of the Oceanic and Pacific
Mail steamship companies.
Captain Hellingsen of the four-masted
schooner Defender met with a serious ac
cident last Saturday. His men were slow
in catting the anchor, and he went for
ward to assist them. A bndden slip in the
! rope pinned his leg to the capstan and
broke the leg in three places. E. Johnson,
with Wilson Bros., sent for an ambulance,
and the injured man was taken to the
German Hospital. Captain Hellinssen
was formerly on the Helen N. Kimball.
The Defender is a new vessel, having been

Bacillus was towed to Folsom-street

The Beaver Hill collier Czarina, after a

she will have her trial trio next Thurs
day. Henry C. Tabrett, marine superin
tendent of the Risdon Iron Works, has
looked after the job, and tnat is sufficient
to say that nothing but good workman
ship has gone into the vessel. Yesterday
was the anniversary of Mr. Tabrett's
eighth year with the Risdon, and during
all that time there has never been a
"kick" about poor work. Among the
engineers on ocean going steamers Harry
is very popular, and whenever an English
ship requires repairing he invariably gets
the job. Unless he branches out for him
self Tabrett is srood for another eignt
years with the Risdon. He is the right
man in the right place.
A boat manned by crab fishermen cap
sizÂ»doff the Cliff House yesterday. One

PAULY OUT WITH
AN AIR CRUISER
All the Known Principles
of Aeronautics in
Combination.
Not Designed to Carry Either
Freight or Passenger
Trains.
The Inventor of the New Wonder
Assured by Scientists That He
Has a Good Thing.
This is different
That is to say it is unlike the aerial
wonder whose legal destinies are presided
over by General Hart.
Max Pauly, mechanical engineer and
inventor, who resides at 504^ Minna
street, has constructed a model ot a flying
machine that differs most radically from
anything ever before seen on the face of
MAX PAULY'S "DIFFERENTIAL FLYING APPARATUS."
[From the plans and specifications of the inventor.]
the earth, the heavens above or the waters
below. He has been mentally at work on
bis marvel lor six years, but made no at
tempt to give his ideas concrete form until
the beginning of the present year. Then,
during a period of enforced idleness caused
by a dull season with bis employers, he
worked eight hours a day for three weeks,
making the many parts and fittings of his
"differential Hying machine," as he calls
it, and putting them together.
Mr. Pauly is modest withal. He does
not claim any extraordinary speed for his
apparatus, nor does he attempt to make
any one believe that it will sail in the
teeth of a wind. His invention, he says,
is a combination of bailonn, aeroplane,
parachute, sailing vessel and steamship.
''I do not expect my invention to carry
a freight tra\n nor a passenger train be
neath it," said the inventor. "To talk of
doing that by any aerial contrivance is
simply nonsense. All that I expect to do
is to carry from three to a half dozen men
and to have the apparatus used for war
purposes, for pleasure cruises by people
rich enough to afford them, and for <x
ploration purposes in such districts as the
interior of Africa, Australia, portions of
Mexico and South America.
"My model Is not a working model, but
is simply for demonstration purposes. I
have carefully and mathematically figured
the whole plan out, and have no doubt it
will do as I claim. To construct a ma
chine that will carry three people will cost
from $6000 to $3000. I have no idea what
speed can be obtained. Ido not propose
to sail directly apainst the wind, but will
be able to travel in a direction opposite to
the wind by tacking, just as a ship does
when met bj a head wind.
"For motive power I snail depend upon
the air enrrents and upon propellers
worked by machinery by means of a gaso
line or naphtha engine. For sustaining
power hydrogen eas will be used. One
cubic yard of this gas will sustain two
pounds of weight, so that my gas bodies,
of which there are three, and the six hol
low sails which I propose to use will have
to contain about 500 cubic yards of hydro
gen gas to carry three men and the appa
ratus with all its accessories.
"The whole structure will be constructed
about a central mast of drawn steel
tubing. This will be in three telescopic
sections. From the center of the mast
three elongated gas bodios will project at
equal distance, but they will be attached
in such a manner that they can be raised
or depressed, and also moved from side to
side. At the outer extremity of each will
be a propeller, and above and below will
be fastened a hollow sail, giving the ap
paratus six sails. Between each gas
body will be stretched stout silken cloth.
In this way will be secured a huge circu
lar aeroplane. In case of accident to the
gas bodies and machinery the whole ap
paratus can be quickly converted into an
immense parachute.
"All the dead weight, such as the water
and fuel supply, machinery, anchor, wind
lasses for controlling the sails and gas
bodies, and cabin for the captain of the
airship, will be at the lower end of the
mast, thus bringing the center of the
gravity so low as to always maintain the
equilibrium of the contrivance.
"In starting the huge arm-like gas
bodies are deflected earthward, so as to
offer the least possible resistance to the
atmosphere as the apparatus rises and at
the same lime the propellers are put in
operation, thus aiding the upward flight
ot the machine. When the one hundred
feet of rope, whicli is to be attached to
the anchor, :s drawn taut the eÂ»a bodie<
will be drawn to a horizontal position and
the anciior will be then hauled aboard.
"Ishftll, of course, select the most favor
able kind of weather for the first trial.
After the machine has risen to the desired
altitude that one of tbe gas bodies which
points with the winii will become the
front of the apparatus. The other two
will be drawn toward one another so as to
form a huge wedge of the whole appa-
ratus. The propeller on the front pas
body will be given a motion to draw the
apparatus after it and the other two pro
pellers will be used to generate driving
power. The sails above and below will be
Ret so as to take advantage of the wind.
The steering will be done by proper ma
nipulation of the propellers, sails and gas
bodies. There will be no special rudder,
as the whole machine will be made on
what is known as the cross rudder prin
ciple.
"When the sails are set they will be in
flated with gas, and wnen furled the gas
will be forced into the regular gas bodies,
so there will be no waste of gas. Ascent
and descent will be made by the deflection
of the front gas body, and consequently
there will be no need of carrying any bal
last. The propellers and. in fact, all the
workable parts cf the apparatus will be
controlled by the engineer, who will be
located in the engine-room. The connec
tions with the- propellers will run through
the hollow mast and tie gas bodies."
Mr. Paulv has already made application
for n patent on bis machine, and is now
endeavoring to enlist capital for the pur
pose of constructing an experimental
â¢'differential flying macnine" capable of
carry three people.
He claims to have submitted his "dem
onstration model 1 ' to a number of scien
tific gentlemen more or less familiar with
aeronautics, all of whom, he said, pro
nounced th? invention a good thing.

One of them pretended to know him
and tried to joe; his memory by saying be
worked for him five or six years ago. Van
Aiken told him that be could not remem
ber him, but taking it for granted that the
man was right ho continued to converse
with him and his companion.
After a few minutes the man who pre
tended to know Van Aiken suggested
they should walk along Buttery street to
tbe water front instead of going in the di
rection of the ferry.
Van Aiken had no objection and the
three walked along Battery street, talking
all the way. When they reached the water
front the two strangers headed for Green
street wharf and Van Aiken, totally unsus
picious of danger, followed them.
There was not a soul in sight, and as
soon as they react ed a dark place on the
wharf one o* the men dropped behiud Van
Aiken, grabbed him by the head and
dragged it backward. Van Aiken saw the
gleam of steel, but before he could cry out
the man drew a knife or razor across his
throat. The other man rifled his pockets
of ?17 50 and then they threw him into the
water.
The men then disappeared in the dafk
ness, but none too soon, as Van Aiken's
cries for help soon brought several people
to his assistance, and he was carried to a
saloon on the corner of Green and Davis
streets.
The harbor police station was at once
notified and the ambulance was sum
moned from the Receiving Hospital.
Tbe wound was about four inches long
and two inches deep. The windpipe was
severed and the blade narrowly missed
the jugular. Van Aiken had a close call,
and at it is he is in a critical condition
from the loss of blood.
Van Aiken described the two men as
follows: One about 5 feet 2or 3 inches
tall, li-iiit mustache and looked like a
Swede; the other was a large man, who
talked like a German, and had a dark com
plexion. This was all the description he
conld give.

WHIST RUINED
GEORGE W. WADE
Played for Slakes at a
Well- Known Local
Club.
Thousands Borrowed From
Friends Among the School
teachers.
A Salary of $175 Per Month Was Not
Suffice nt to Satisfy His Losses
fet Cards.
An overfondness for whist and the com
pany of women other than his wife ap
pear to have caused the downfall of George
Wade, the assistant secretary of tbe board
of Education. He was one of the most
devoted members of the San Francisco
Whist Club, at whose rooms playing for
stakes is permitted, and spent much of
his time in the club-rooms.
The fact that his opponents were well
to-do men who could stand losses did not
deter Wade from playing, for he consid
ered himself a strong hand at whist.
Even his salary of $175 per month could
not stand the strain, and he was always
in financial straits at the end of the
month.
"My husband was a member of the San
Francisco Whist Club." said Mrs. Wade
yesterday. "He was a great devotee of
the game and used to play there fre
quently.
"I bfame tbe wbist club for all of our
trouble. George used to go there at nights
and in a hack room p'.ay whist for 20 cents
a trick. He used to tnink he was a pretty
good player, but I think there were others
who were better. In this way he loÂ«t con
siderable money, and he was lorce.i to
borrow and neglect paying his bills to
matte his losses good nt the whist table.
l: When he said he only piayed for 20
cents a trick I thought that was nothing.
The men he played with were rich, and
G u orge's salary would not stand the drain
of many losses. 1 wanted him to give up
the whist club, but he was perfectly in
iatuated with ;heganie."
The San Francisco Whist Club is the
only large organization devoted to the
game in this City where playing for
stakes is permitted. It was originally in
.tended to have a clau*e in the by-laws

Two new plays were presented by the
TVilto:: Lackaye cornpariy at the lia.dwin
Theatar last nieht. Tne cartain-raiser,
iera,** by Waiter Firth, was played
for the first time in America, and maie a
ivorable impression. "Captain Bob,"
acted last night for t^e first time on any
stage, war denominated a comedy- irazna.
It did not take the fancy of tbe pub ie as
the little curtain-raiser nad done.
The author of "Moiere" had a touching
theme to go upon Ln the story of the great
French playwright's end. It is a matter
of ij. story that he played when he should
have been on bis deathbed, in order tnat
nor comedians should not oe disap
po nted of their pittance, and that his
heart was wellni.-h broken by the fickle
â ad ri fcg.ee: ol the beautiful coquette
whom he nad married.
On this ba.-.is Walter Firth has written a
very effec ive little drama, which may
owe some of its inspiration to the plot of
'; i'agliacci," but which is mainly origi
nal. Moiiere, in a dying condition, is
brought home from that famous last ap
pearance of his. He and bis wife have
not spoKen for weeks except on tbe stage,
nnd she refusing to believe that he is
dvinp. is going to -up witu a butterfly
llarquia irorn LouiÂ« XV's court.
Mniiere, who iongs to have hernear him
in his last moments, tells the Marquis
that he wishes to declaim a scei.e from
the new comedy. He himself will play
tho part of an c derly farm r whose youn^'
wife is fa^se to him. The fair Armand Mo
-.null be the wile and he be s the
j ;is to play the little role of the lover.
Armande enters gayly into the plot, and
the Marquis, beini; â  distinguished dilet
tanti, condescends to pos- and s.-:y a few
words. At first the iun is fast and furiou-,
but gradually it dawns on Armande that
her i.usband is not acting, and she shrinks
back In horror at the womb of fierce re
proach that Moiiere addresses to the pay
lover, hmitten with remorse, she lets the
Marquis sup alone that evening, and on
her knees makes her peace with her hus
band just as fie dies.
Lackave gave a most interesting and
intelligent rendering of Moliere's role.
Tiie qua ity of pathos is not tfaia actor'a
Ktrong point, but hi.-. Molieri- was a care
ful character study, the comedy scene was
cleverly grot q .<â  anil there was a mosi
convincing earnastiMM in the serious
passages. Miss Marie Wainwr.ght was
the coquettish play actress Armande :o
the life, and Byron Douglas was clever as
the foppish Slarq'iiÃ. The staging of
'â¢Moiiere" was :i rtistic in the extreme.
"Captain Bob," by Bobart DnmÂ«t, waÂ«
quite another sort of play. It was de
mribed as a comedy, but it more resem
bled a mild melodraiai. The scene was
laid in Virginia, but the only local col r
ing lay in some people of color, Josei.h
Al en playing tbe part of an cd nur-e
very humorou-lv. "Captain Bob" ha? :t
Lerrayed damsel, who bege the villain to
be tru to his vows, and when he reuses
tries to drown heraeif.
ihe same villain wishes to marry the
ingenue lie-oine, and if one may be per
mitted to say it of so pretty an actr^s-,
Miss Wain wrisrht wus no young and In-
OUi enough for tne heroine's rolp â it
was too lri:!iy for her. As Captain Bob,
ill*- gen'ieruan who smoothed out the
difficulties in every one's path, Wiiton
Lackaye had a congenial role winch en-
I him to 'he audience. The drama is
per-ionss centrally in "Captain Bob"
should restrain their arior in tlie sla h
in^ of r;ding-whips. Even in hunting
countries people do not go through Jile
flicking whips.
Colombia Theater.
"Tho Cotton King," which wu played tor
the firHt time in till* City at the Columbia
Theater last night, is a stirring- melodrama of
Villainy, love '-.ud iu;i, with one particularly
thrilling â ecoe, in which the heroine U all but
cruMn-d under on elevntor.
I'hojbe Davles, as Hetty Drayson, very
touching in the many troubles that Jell to her
in , and bet faith in '"Jack" was of course un
swerving in the face of tho most suxpicious c:r
cumÂ«tauces. As for "Jack," the cotton king.
John T. Sullivan took him very successfully
through all the harrowing and undeserved
afflictions that always befall the hero of' rnelo
(liHiin., and in his case the afflictions included
incarceration in a madhouse.
Ji.Kcph Grismcr took the part of a drunken
e:iÃine-driver who was discharged for his
shortcomings, but whose heart \ us in the
right place when it came to withstanding
temptation at the hi nis of the villain. He
had M-vÂ«;rnl heavy scenes and did them ad
mirably. Edward J. Heron, who bad been
"lent. by iiorosco for the production, also did
Rome clever work.
The picnic scene, where the mill hands dis
ported themselves, win. amusing mid full of
good specialties, but the great â "neat ion of the
p!Â»y was the scene with tin- calico printing
milt in operation and the elevator running.
Under the descending elevator ilurdre. Kirk
land, i.s Richard :-;a'k,ey, the villain, put
Hetty Drayaon, and the was torn trim her
perilous position by the Cotton King, just in
time to save her from being crushed to a jelly.
Th., Tivoll.
Jacques Offenbach's uprightly fantalsie "The
Brigands" wan revived at the Tivoll Opera
house, with almost the entire strength of the
company, Just evening, to an audience that
manifested its appreciation of the-presema
'â 'â â¢â ' of the music and action by frequent ap
plause. Lilly Post in the character at Fiorella,
the brigand's daughter, whs In good voice,
r.nd â 'â â ' Hartman r* the old-time brigand
came In for a good share of commendation for
hi* rendition of the character of I'ictro. Klvia

tice of In is eft] iÂ«, made up as a very pretty
highwayman, but the gem of the evening whs
the rendition <>:â ".,.â  boots, the boots, of the
carbineers," rendered by imp chief brigands
and the entire company in chorus.
Tin- Orplirum.
The Orpheum continues to catch the fancy
of a multitude of nmuseincnt lovers. The
notice was crowded last night. Cleremont's
animals do wonderful thing*. The poodle dog
plays tho "Last Kose of Hummer" on the
piano in a manner quite acceptable to the au
dience.
Tne manager regents the notion that the
piano Is played by,* wires connected with
human Imnds. The achievements of the Dun
bur intern are not those of human hands
either, but human legs cut quite afljrure in'
the lerformauco. Tho â  turn have a London
and New York reputation as slur attractions
and Their engatremont in San Francisco will
add to the renown of the Orpheum.
Grnnil (Â»|)itii-HouÂ»b.
For sensational aituutions, pure and simple,
and stÃKe effecte "'iho I'romiseJ Land," pre
â ented to a goo.J audience at the Grand Opera
liouso last night, is the equal of any melo
drama ever ol!Vn n. The play is founded on
the irials and tribulations and final happiness
of a young woman whose brother, faleely ac
cused of ii crime. U forced to fiei-. Ah usual,
there is a bad man, wiio in this Instance is
the one who commiU'Ml the crime of which

ihe heroine of the play. Cricket Warring, was
played by Victory Batestan, who carried out

did well as a demented boy, while Howard
Kyle as the hero of the, play was a good per

ites were heartily applauded. Hugo Toland
Kad a superb rf-*-nforcement in the audience.

An Important Meeting of
the Afro- American
League.
Drat of a Bill Prepared to
Come Before the Legis-
lature.
An important meeting of the Afro-
American Leaeue was held last evening
at California Hall; President T.B.Mor
ton in tbe chair.
A report of the executive committee
was rec>-ive-d and unanimously adopted,
in which T. B. Morton was exonerated
from a charge contained in an article in
the Elevator which had the caption of
"Disgraceful." The charge purported to
be contained in an interview with W. K.
Henderson, and was in substance that Mr.
Morton "sold out the colored voters of this
City, right and left, to the candidates and
politicians of all parties and factions dur
ing the last campaign."
The executive committee found that
there "was not one scintilla of truth in the
statement. " In addition to th:s charges
were made by tbe committee against W.
E. Henderson concerning bis action on
election day.
Letters thanking Mr. Morton, as presi
dent of the league, for the good work of
the league at the recent election, were
read. Among the signers were President
elect McKinley; Charles Deck, who is
Mark Han.ia's secretary; F. L. Uarnett
i f the Republican National Committee,
and Frank McLaujrhlin, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee of
California. The letter from President
elect McKinley was as follows:
Canton, Ohio. Nov. 7, 1890.
T. 11. Morton, President Afro-American League,
San Francisco, i al.â My Dear Sib: Please con
vey to the members of the Afro-American
League, my appreciation, not only of their
congratulations sent through you, but ol their
hearty and loyal support. Very truly yours,
W. WcKi.vLEV.
A matter of leading importance before
the meeting was the appointment of a
committee of five to confer at the Assem
bly Club wit another committee con
cerning Â»he best way to urge measures
before the Legislature, which are summed
up as follows: v
Repeal section 60, article I, of the
Civil Code, commonly known as "the
black law," reading as ''follows: "All

G. W. Mitchell and W. W. Butler.
MONEY FOR EXHIBITS.
Demand Made by the State Board of
'i rade.
The Btate Board of Trade has made a
demand for an appropriation of $2500 oy
tbe Supervisors in aid of getting up a
California exhibit to send to ihe Guate
malan exhibition and another to send to
the. Hamburg â¢xhibition. Tbe sum of
$i. r )00 is asked for the former and $1000 for
the latter. It is proposed to send to the
exhibition at Guatemala samples of min
ing machinery and all kinds of manu
lactured articles and some wines, but
little or no California fruits, as there is no
market for such there. On the contrary
it is proposed to send California fruits anil
w.iu's only to Hamburg and send com
mercial :^mples, so that parlies may
order by sample and receive exactly tbe
same class of goods. There is also to be
an exhibit of choice fruits. HHniburg haw
taken quite a liking to California orchard
products, as may be judged by tne fact

DEATH THE COST
OF HIS ATTACK
Rancher Peters Succumbs
to Wounds Given by
Ching Ky.
The Chinaman Claims He Used
His Kni:e Oaly to Save
Himself.
Wa3 Assailed for Trespassing on the
Farmer's Land While in Qjest
of Mushrooms.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec 7.â Frank
Peters, the Portuguese rancher who was
stabbed by a Chinaman at Rides Landing
on Saturday, died this morning from tbe
effects of his wounds. Ching Ky. who did
the cutting, is lodged in the County Jail
here to await a hearing on a murder
charge.
The Mougol stated to-day that be had
been out gathering mushrooms, and had
procured a boxful and a basketful, a por
tion of whicn he had picked on Peters'
ranch. As he was walking away from the
place be was accosted by Peters, who said
he had no rignt to trespass on his prem
ises and demanded the results of hia
labor. The Chinaman told Peters that he
had procured the boxful of mushrooms on
another ranch, and offered to givt up the
ones in the basket, which he had gath
ered in Peters' field. Tne refusal on his
part to give up all the mushrooms, he
cla ms, angered Petal, who picked up a
stick and struck nim over the head.
Tne infuriated rancher then ran into
the barn and came uut with, a pitchfork
and attempted to strike tne Mongolian,
who drew a knife and slashed at his op
ponent, inflicting a gash over three inches
long in the left side of the abdomen.
Tne Chinaman then sought to escape.
Wh:ie running he threw the bloody biade
â¢n o the canal. The Portuguese settle
ment was aroused, and as Peters waa
hiyiily respected in that section the in
dignation was great. A party composed
of "Doc" Stewart, \V. A. Kesner and
Horace Albert armed it elf and started
off in a < arnage in ttie direction the China
man had taken. Two miles away they
overtook him at the brink of the canal,
which he was afraid to cross. They placed
him under arrest and delivered him into
the cv tody of Deputy Sheriff Harvey,
who brought him to this city.
Peters was one of the best- known
ranchers of nis locality. He was 33 years
old. A widow and several children sur
vive him.
CLAIMS AGAINST THE STATE.
Three Institutions Increase Monthly Ex-
pendituresâ J. M. Wood's $11,000
Request.
BACRAMENTO.CaI., Dec. 7.â The State
Board of Examiners to-day agreed to
allow the cla.m of the Soldiers' Home at
Yountville in the sum of $11,250, or $75
yearly per inmate. As the St ite uoes not
own the institution and has been improv
ing the grounds out of the maintenance
fund, it was decided to maice a formal de
mand on the direct T3 for the deeds to the
property before making any further appro
priations.
The Deaf and Dumb and Blind Asylum,
with an increase of five or six DUpils, have
increased their monthly cxi enditure from
$29<J0 to $3300. Tney have increased sala
ries and added a music teacher to the list
of employes. The Governor stated tnat
this was evidently done for the purpose
of fOJny to the Legislature with a deficit,
so as to procure larger appropriations, and
he was in favor of blocking the game.
J. M Woods appeam] before the board
and presented a claim for $11,000 against
the .Sate Board of Harbor Commissioners.
Tins, he claims, accrued in the construc
tion of section B ot the San Francisco iea
wall. The contract was awarded to F. J.
and J. B. Owens, who agreed io do tne
wdrk for $16,000. Woods supplied the
money. Tne job, by reason of an increase
in the price of material, cost $27,000.
Woods now wishes the State to ma l :e good
the $11,000 put in above the contract price.
Secretary of State Brown expressed the
opinion that the Board of Harbor Com
missioners instead of the Board of Exam
iners was the one to go to. Woods stated
that he only asKe l the board to make a
favorable recommendation to the Legisla
ture on a claim which was just. Governor
Budd replied tnat the board conld not set
a frecedent by passing such a bill, a^ it
would encourage all kinds of trickery in
Slate contracts.
"That precedent has been observed for
hundreds of years," said Woods. "I gav<.Â«
my money to the sovereign people of the
Svato of California. Do they want it for
nothing? Richard the Third observed the
precedent of vaiUe received. If you gave
the Prince of Wales a two-bit cigar you
would get six bits in return for it. I want
only to pet my money back. The .Sate
has no moral right to keep it from me."
"Well," retorted Governor Budd, "if
you can get Richard the Third or the
Prince of Wales to intercede lor you, you
might get it through the Legislature, "but
their patronage would not prevent me
from vetoing it."
"Well, I'm a fighter, and I'll try my
best to mi'.ke the Legislature see my way
and give you whatever chance you wish
to down me," was Woods' parting
mark.
Secretary Markely was instructed to
look into tha matter and report next Mon
day. Woods will report the facts to
Markley. Governor Budd remarked that
this was nothing more than courtesy de
manded, as he was convinced that unless
a more worthy showing was made notning
woutd be done by the board.
GOFERNIR JtUftlt'B MESSAGE.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 7.â Governor

A STEADY BUSH
TO RANDSBURG
Patrick Reddy Returns
Here After a Weeli in
the Great Camp.
Men Going in From Everywhere
at the Rate ot One Hun
dred a Day.
Patrick Reddy, the widely known attor
ney and one or the owners of a rich gold
mine in tbe Randsburg district, has re
turned here after a week's absence at the
mine. He says there is a big boom at
Rundsburg, tbe mines are all looking well,
and he believes tbe district will prove one
of the richest ever knuwn.
He was found at his law office yester
day, very busy trying to catch up hL
work. He snid he did not have time for a
detailed intervii-w. but would in brief say
that it looked like a coming great country
to him.
"As to the area of the rich region," be
said, "it is several hundred miles lonj*,
and it is known to be from forty to fifty
m les in width. Both quartz and placer
mines are found all over. In a general
way tbe veins iollow the north and south
course of the bills. Taking it from east to
west, a number of mountain* and ranges
are crossed.
"There is water at Cow Wells, the place
recently called Garlock, where there is an
eight-stamp mill, two stamps run by
steam direct. Another mill, one of ten
stamps, is being erected. Plenty of water
can be had by sinking.
"Reddy, Campbell and Metson have a
shaft 377 leet deep. At sixty feet water
wa-4 struck, find it has been increas;- c,
rapidly. There is enough now for a 20
-stamp mill. This mine is on the west
side of the valev from the Randsburg
mine*. All the Randsburg mines that
have been worked lor ore exclusively pay,
and will pay.
"It was estimated a week ago that there
were from 1000 to 1500 men in tbe camp,
and they are going :n at tbe rate of about
100 a day from everywhere.
'â¢It is very cool there. I had a fire in
ttie cabin aX tbe time I was down there.
It was average win t-r weather. Up where
most of i lie developed mines are it is
much cooler. The altitude Is some 4000
feet. The weather never gets hot. Even
in summer it is pleasant.
"Tnere is another mill at Kaln's Spring.
It is of rive stamps and is running, and be
sides tnis there is machinery on the
ground tor rive stamps more. No doubt
o ner mills will be erected th< re. Kain's
Spring is also on tbe west side cf the val
ley.
"On tbe eastern slope they are putting
up a ten-stamp mill, and have found
water that will be pumped into Rands
"l think it is tbe greatest gold field in
California. The mines are not confined
to a single range, but there is range alter
range, and tbe extent of tne field east has
not by any means been determined or
Jimiied. As I see it tnere will be a great
big camp there by the next year. I can
not compare the district with the Rand or
Coolvariiie, because I have not an intimate
enough knowledge of those places.
"Lots of capital is now coins Into tbe
Randsburg country for investment. This
capital and the men that are going ti>ere
will, I think, cause some great develop
ments. It is in all respects a remarkable
country."
DESIGNED AN AIRSHIP.
Robert Xagler Dies Before His Plans
Could Be Perfected.
Robert Nagler, a trussmaker at 410
Kearny street, died suddenly of apoplexy
at 719 Market street last (Sunday night,
and the case was reported to the Coroner.
Nagler wa^ an inventor, and it was bis
hope to create an airship before bis death.
In fact, he had progressed so far in this
direction as to have prepared plans and
models of an airship on which he received
letters patent from Washington. There
was the element of originality In his
ideas. His plans show a large ship-shaped
vessel, operated by five large spiral pro
pellers. Those orl each end of his strange
air craft were to . ive it its forwar flight.
On the deck he intended to have three
tall masts, around which, from the top to
the bottom, large light spiral rropellers
revolve. These were to assist the gas in
the ship in lifting tbe structure. Rudders
tore and ait were also designed.
Mr. Nagler also secured letters patent
on the spiral propellers to be applied to
ordinary ships, to tune the place of tbe
propellers now in use. He had worked on
these k'eas for several years. He was 75
years old and a native of Germany.
GAVE HIS LIFE
WITH HIS GOLD
Mining Prospector Stabbed
and Robbed in
Yuma.
An Indian Finds the Victim's
Body Concealed in a
Th.cket
Authorities of the Arizona Town
Have No Clew to tha
Assassin-
YCMA, Aeiz!, Dec. 7. â One of the
strangest and most inexplicable murders
ever recorded in Yuma County was dis
covered to-day. In a lonely and unfre
quented portion of the western suburb of
Yuma a roving Cocopah Indian found a
bundle of bedding, such as is ordinarily
carried by prospectors in their trips
through the hills. Upon investigation it
was found to conceal the body of the mur
dered owner.
Gaping knife wounds in the head, the
throat and the breast gave evidence of the
crime; but when, where and why the
man was slain are questions to De an
swered. Overhung by willow boughs,
almost buried in /alien leaves and covered
by a large bundle of bedding, the body
was entirely concealed from casual r>asÂ«era
by, but the sharp eyes of the Indian
espied tbe eundie that a white man would
have passed and repassed without notic
ing.
Investigation failed to disclose the iden
tity of the man further than that he was
noticed on the streets of Ynma Saturday
carrying the bundle which afterward
served to conceal his body. There were
nd signs of a scuffle at the spot where ha
was found, and it is evident tnat he was
murdered elsewhere and the body con
veyed to the willow thicket Two knife
ga.fhes were found in tbe head, but neither
would have caused death, as the skull was
not penetrated. Directly through the
center of the breastbone a large biade had
been plunged and there were gashes in the
heart.
The man appeared to be about 45 years
old, 5 feet 5 incdes tall and weighed about
135 pounds. A striking fe.-.ture was tbat
his mouth contained but one toothâ a
molar in the left jaw. His clothes, which
were fairly good, contained no letters or
papers which might lead to his identifi
cation, but on the band ol his white-feit
hat was the name "San Diego." The
pocket of his trousers were cut open, and
the conclusion is that he was murdered
for robbery.
THE LOTTERY OF RICHES.
A Good Woman's Advantage of Marry-
ing a Poor Man.
"I have been young and now am old,"
Â»aid one of the charming middle-aged
women of the period, whose looks belie
the baptismal regi-ter, and who rather
enjoy arrogating to themselves tbe wis
dom and experience of age, says the
Washington Star. "And I have reached
that period of life," she continued, ''when
I can look bacK and see results and note
how seldom those who are born with sil
ver spoons in their mouths, as the saying
is, have the silver fork when they are
grown up. When I look back and remem
ber who were the jeunesse doree of my
vouthâ tbe men whose lives and positions
above all others seemed particularly envi
able and desirable â and then look" about
me and see how few of those who were
called men of pleasure in tho-e days have
attained an honorable and useful middle
age, I feel that I can preach a sermon to
my boys and their friends with object les
sons that ought to make it very impres
sive, bonie are poor, having spent health
and sub tance, like the prodigal, in riotous
living. Even tho-<e who have apparently
not suffered in purse or health are a set of
discontented, blase, weary worldlings, who

existence year by year without pleasure
or profit.

vantage ground of a iifeiong experience is

Why Thunder Rolls.
The prolonged roll of thunder is reariily
explained by comparison witb a volley
n":ej along a line o: troops. Suppose
troops to be drawn up in linein sucli num
ber as to extend for a rmle and ordered,
by a signal mat ail cou.d see, to tire al
once. One standing at the end of the 1 ne
would hear the report M the musket near
est him insiantly. He would hear the
others successively.
Thus a report 550 feet away would come
to him in half a second and he would not
hear the last report for live or six seconds
after the gun had been fired. This would
produce a sort of roll, whicfj wou a gradu
ally increase to intensity. Flashes of
liehtning may be considered as represent
ing tbree lines of troops aiong wh.cb the
explosions occur at the same time. Con
sider the variety o' distance and position
of the listener and we account f..r the
variety of sound in thunder. In moun
tainous regions the rolling is augmented

"An Alleged Trial" and
" An Alleged Ver
dict."
Proceedings in the Trial Court
as So Described by His
Lawyers.
Whether It Wi'l Be Receive: by the
Supreme C urt Will Bi Decided
in Two Weeks.
W. H. T. Darrant's attorneys, Messrs.
Dickinson and Denprey, were in the Su
preme Court yesterday in support of their
motion to dismiss the order of submission
made recently at Los Angeles. The pur
pose of this was to permit the tiling and
consideration of tbe brief in behalf ot
Durrant, which the attorneys have, with
much care and labor, prepared.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald was also
present. He tacitly consented to having
the order set aside in behalf of the S;ate,
wh.en he rose and said that he had not
been aDle to prepare the brief for the
people in the case. This brief, which the
Attorney-General has in preparation, is in
answer to the brief of Durrant's attorneys.
The latter was prepared two weeks ago
and was handed to tbe clerk of the Su
preme Court, to be filed whenever the
court should consent to set aside its order.
A copy was given by Darrant's lawyers to
the Attorney-General.
The court after hearing what the Attor
ney-General had to say put the matter
over until December 21. At that time the
Attorney-General's brief will be ready to
file. The order will be set aside, the two
briefs will be put in, and then the defense
will have ten days or such other time as
the court may order to file an answer to
the Attorney-General's brief. That will
be the last step preparatory to hnal sub
mission.
The brief of Durrant's lawyers, about
which little has been said definitely, con
tains some lively reading. The hearing
wnich re-ulted in the conviction os Dur
rant is called "an alleged trial," and in it
the action of the jury is described as fol
lows:
The jury, being charged by the court, re
tired, and in a few minutes, without any time
to deliberate upon the evidence presented
before them rom September 4, 1895, to Oc
tober 25. 1895. returned a verdict oi -'guilty"
against the defendant and appellant here'u.
The verdict is termed "the alleged ver
dict," and it is c aimed that "mere is not
a particle of evidence WDich can be pointed
to in or ascertained from a perusal of the
wnole record of evidence introduced upon
the alleged trial of the case which m any
wise shows that the defendant and ap
pellant herein either assaulted or injured
Blanche Lamont."
Concerning the arguments of the As
sistant District Attorney and the District
Attorney to the jury the brief ssys this:
The Assistant District Attorney in his lan
euHee asserted, "What was the motive? t'n
bribed parson," and followed the assertion
wan oratorical flights of fancy to extreme
cases oi the dark Hges and tbe monstrons base
ness of Marquis de Sade. There was not the
slightest foundation in proof of any nature to
support the weirdness ot Mr. Peixotto's assev
e.-Ktioa.v In fact all the evidence in the case
was to the contrary.
The District Attorney hinted at outrage
without the least justification for the inier
ence. There was not an atom ol proof to es
tablish motive and from ail the surrounding
circumstances there was not any evidence to
even indicate a motive.
The brief discusses 232 points. In the
last paragraph occurs the following:
From a thorough knowledge ot the case and
the proof deduceJ and adduced, we fervently
contendâ we in good faith contendâ that Wil
liam H. T. Durraut is iniiotie.it of the crime of
whica he s ands cnargod, and we ask that
under the laws he be given the opportunity of
being tried in a proper manner and in accord
ance with the provisions of these laws â laws
which govern a civilized people and nation.
PARENTES MURDER,
ThÂ« Widow Creates a ceno of Excite
ment in Judge Cam bell's Court.
The preliminary examination of Lu
igi Palo, charged with the mur
der of Augustino Parenti, a musi
cian, by administering to him poison
in a glass of wine, on November 20, was
commenced before Judge Campbell yes
terday afternoon. The defendant was
represented by Attorneys Spinetti and H.
C. Grant, and Prosecuting Attorney Quig
ley conducted the prosecution.
The witnesses for the prosecution were
the same who testified at the Coroner's in
quest. Mrs. Parenti repeated the scene
she enacted at the inquest, with slight va
riations. When eiving her testimony she
became hysterical and shrieked out as she
pointed her finger at Palo, "You mur
dered my husband; you have left me and
my children to starve. If I had a pistol I
would shoot you."
She continued to howl and shriek, cre
ating the wildest excitement in court,
until she was taken out and locked up in
the Judge's chambers. While passing
Palo she struggled nercely to free her
bands from trie officer's grasp and suc
ceeded in petting tier right hand released.
Quick as lightning she bent down and
grasped boid of a spittoon that wai close
to where Palo was sittins:. She was about
to hurl it nt Palo's head, but it was
wrenched out ot her hand. Palo said
s-omething to her which quieted her for
a moment. In her excitement she nearly
bit one of her fingers off.
Palo gave his evidence and told tbe
same story he iias told since he was ar
resied. Th â¢ case was continued till this
afternoon, when more witnesses for the
defense will be heard. The JnJge ex
pressed himself as very much impressed
with the truth of Palo's stoiy.

THEY ALL MEET
IN FRATERNITY
Evangelical Ministers In
augurate Union Meet
ings.
Bishop N?wman Speaks on the
Reformatory Forces of
Christianity.
A Large Audience of Pastors From
Tbis City and Oakland Listen
Applaud.
What the evangelical pastors of this
City hope is the beginning of a new
order of things was inaugurated yester
day morning when the pastors of nearly
all the evangeical denominations met
together in a grand union meeting at the
Association Auduorium to hear an address
by Bishop Newman. A large assemblage
of pastors from this City and across the
bay listenÂ«d with deep interest to the
Bishop's address and received it with fre
quent applause. Rev. H. C. Minton, D.D.,
presided and Rev. M. P. Boynton gave the
scriptural reading.
The subject of Bishop Newman's
address was "The Reformatory Forces o.
Christianity." He began by sayin ; that
the only hope of this world is in Christian
ity and by drawing attention to the sor
rows of humanity, the history of which he
declared waa a funeral march from the
craule to the grave. "After all these years
of Christian work, is there any balm in
Gileau? Has your religion proved
adequate? Look at the condition of the
world, and the oppression, mas-acre,
idolatry, the selfishness ot commerce and
the want of consecration of the intellect
of the age. Is there no balm in Gilead?
This is the question that you, as Christian
ministers, are bound to answer."
A.ter touching at length on these ques
tions and tilufcirating his remarks with
vivid imageiy, the Bishop sketched the
philosophy of agnosticism as opposed to
the Christian conception that human
nature cannot suppress vice and sustain
virtue without a power exterior to itself.
He also described and discussed the
various panaceas which are considered by
many j>eopie as the only things needed to
uplift human nature.
"The tneory of the statesman is that
what is necessary is law. We uphold
law ; but then lan is inadequate to accom
piisn certain resnits, for it is a well-known
tact tuat all forms of government have
faiied to suppress the evil of our naturr.
Under the worst forms of government the
best men hay lived and under the best
lorms of governnu-ni the worst men have
lived, bo it is a fact that the power to
change the hearts of men is not in legisla
tion. The real energy of civil law is in
moral sentiment. Take your own mag
nificent Republic; it would go to pieces
iike a rt pc of sand were it not ior the
moral sentiment which is Postered by the
Christian church."
Bishop Newman next touched on the
iheory of thp scholar, that ignorance is
the source of the world's woe, and by de
scribing the hi^rh culture on the banks of
the Ganges and in ancient Greece showed
that mere intellectuality had been tried
under the most favorable circumstances
and had failed. "All hail to our public

schools," he said, and this sentiment was
warmly applauded. "All hail to them,
but they may educate atheists; they may
realize what Paul said: 'Knowledge
puffeth up.'
'â¢Philanthropy! Well, who would say a
word against philanthropy. But In its mod
ern sense it sympathizes with conditions
and not with human nature. No one can
call Christ a philanthropist as we under
stand the word. He went through the
crowd s.iyine: 'Seek first the kingdom of
God and his righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto you.' These
things meaning cioth*s, food, etc. Is
there a statesman to-day who has the
couraee to stand side by side with Christ
and teach this divine system of political
economy? If there were this world would
become an earthly paradise."
The Bishop declared that the key to the
situation lay in the statement "Ye must
be born again." Christ did not come into
the world to reform men's temporal con
dition,but to reform their hearts, and just
in proportion as their Christian philoso
phy is received does society move forward
in peace and plenty, for schools, hospitals
and philanthropic institutions of all sorts
are ttie natural sequence of the spread of
true Christianity.
The address was received with great ap
plause, and in departing from the hall
many expressions of satisfaction weie
made by the ministers at the fraternal de
parture inaugurated by union meetings.
The union committee is a permanent one,
and from time to time celebrated ministers
visiting the coast will be invitea to make
union addresses.

THE BARRICADES
Sloughs in the San Pablo
Marshes That Are
Blockaded.
Sportsmen Who Are Waging
War Against Marsh Land
Preierves.
A District Attorney Who Has R â¢
fused to Issue Warrants for the
Arrest of Hunters-.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
of this City i 3 determined to leave no
stone unturned that will bring transgres
sors of the law to justice. One of the as
sociation's attorneys, W. S. Schmidt, said
yesterday that he expected that the au
thorities in Washington must have pigeon
holed the report sent by H. 8. Foote, the
United States District Attorney, regard
ing the blockading of navigable waters in
Solano Comity by a sportsman's club.
"It is now a month or more," said Mr.
Schmidt, "since Mr. Knight, who is a
deputy of Mr. Foote's, mailed to the At
torney-General at Washington a full re
port of the obstructions in certain navi
gable waters in the Suisun marsh, in
accordance with a report that was sub
mitted to him by the United States dis
trict engineers.
"As nothing bas been heard from Wash
ington since the report was mailed, it is
presumed that the matter was considered
of such small significance that very little
cognizance has be j u taken of it by the
authorities in Washington.
"Possibly in the sweet by and by we may
hear something that will interest us in
this panic. ilar.
"However, the law relative to the
blockading of navieable waiers a very
pla.n. It reads that any person who shall
blockade a streum or siough of navigable
capacity shall be deemed guilty of a mis
demeanor, which is punishable by a fine
o. $5000 ami one year's imprisonment for
every week that tbe obstruction is main
tained, or words to thai effect.
"Now, I cannot understand why the
authorities will not take immediate ac
tion to punish those people who persist in
maintaining those obstructions to navigat
ion. At any rate the association is de
termined to fight this matter to the end.
"On Saturday last I visited the San
Pablo marsh, or at least that part of it
which is preserved by a club of sports
men. A photographer who accompanied
me took pictures of the barricades which
have been erected in the Davis Slough and j
other sloughs that are unquestionably
navigable."

When asked for information concerning
the long-pending trespass suit which was
brought against certain members of the
association by a Mrs. Teux berry, who is
the owner of the San Pablo marsh lands
leased by Emeric. Murdoch and others for
shooting purposes, Mr. Schmidt said:
"The tresja-s ca c of Mrs. Teux berry
against Jones and other sportsmen, mem
bers of the Protective Association, was to
have been tried in Martinez on November
6 by Superior Judge Jones of Contra
Costa County, but the attorney for the
plaintiff sent word at the last moment
that he was indisposed and could not at
tend on that day, and as a result the case
was : ostponed indefinitely. I cannot say
now when it will be called again.
"District Attorney Brown of Martinez
has grown tired of issuing warrants for
the arrest of sportsmen who have been
shooting wild geese on tbe San Pablo pre
serve, and has so informed tbe lessees of
the marshes in question; but the keeper?,
who dress in cowboy fashion, carry hol
sters strapped to their sides on purpose to
intimidate hunters who happen into the
preserve.
"I do not think this policy on the part
of tne preserve dubs is right until the Su
perior Court of Contra Cos! a County de
c dcs that those unreclaimed lands which
are bounded by navigable sloughs are pri
vate property.
"A court decision will end the right be
tween the association and the owner or i
lessees of the marshes, but until this qu?sÂ«
tion is decided permanently 1 believe that
hunters have a right to shoot thereon.
"The only decision that h-'S as yet been
rendered is that of Judge Buckles of the
Superior Court of Solano County, which
was in favor of the hunters and against
the preservers."
TO CLOSE SALOONS.
A Largely Attended Meeting, at Which
a Permanent Organization la
Effected.
A large meeting of delegates from
ministerial associations and temperance
societies was held yesterday afternoon at
the Young Men's Christian Association,
and the result of the meeling was the
formation of an organization to be known
as the Anti-Saloon League of California.
Rev. S. W, Fergusson was appointed
temporary chairman of the meeting, and
Rev. Dr. Bovard made an adaress, de
scribing the legi>latiou aimed at for the
suppression of saloons by the Anti-Saloon
League. He describ"d the success of the
organization in tlie Eust, and stated that
there the Catholics had worked hand in
hand with the evangelical denominations.
Archbishop Watterson and Arctibishop
Ireland were spoken of as two pre.ates
who had heartily indorsed the movement.
Durine the course ot Dr. Bovard's ad
dress on the subject of anti-saloon legis
lation Frank E. Coulter of Selma, one of
the Good Temperance delegates, asked
whether this might not be construed into
legislating anainst a class.
Dr. Bovard replied that at a proper time
that question might be considered, but
that there was no bearinu on that point
then. On motion of Dr. Bovard it was
unanimously resolved to effect a perma
nent organization, and the following com
mute was appointed to select a nomi
nating commi'tee for offices: Rev. F. D.
Bovard, Mrs. D. J. Spencer, Rev. M. P.
Buyntou, Rev. J. M. French, Rev. J. B.
Orr.
On motion of Dr. Dille the following

ANOTHER HARD JOLT DEALT
THE MONARCH OF THE FAKERS
Juror Robertson of Recent Williams Libel- Case Fame
Nails Another Examiner Lie to
the Wall. . ,
HIS CO-JURORS ACTED AS
GENTLEMEN.
Not Threatened With Violence
Nor Was There a Dream
of a LynchingÂ« Bee.
THE EVIDENCE DECIDED HIS
OWN VOTE.
His Statement in Open Court Not
Challenged by Any Member of
the Panel.
The "Monarch of the Fakers" received
another staggering blow in Judge Dain
gerfield's court yesterday morning. It
was a thrust below the fiftn rib, an tipper
cut delivered fairly and in manly fashion
by Juror Donald Robertson, and was well
calculated to knock out whatever preten
JUROR JOHN D. ROBERTSON, Who Had the Courage of
His Opinions.
sion for truthfulness and accuracy was
ever possessed by the San Francisco end
of V.iihe Hearst's Siamese journalistic
syndicate, in the organization of which
this young silver-mine proprietor holds
the position of joining ligature.
Upon the opening of court all the jurors
of the panel for the present term were
present, including the tweive good men
ami true who last ween sat in the trial of
Thomas S. Williams Jr. x
Williams was accused of Jibeling Judge
Hebbard by publishing a circular askine
voters not to vote for him, because his
friendship for "the notorious James A!va
Watt" and "the political parasite John
F. Sheehan had led to great loss for the
depositors in the defunct People's Home
Savings Bank, and caused the signers of
the circular to believe that Judge Heb
bara was unfair, and an unfair person to
act as a Judge of the Superior Court.
W T hen Judge Daingerfield called up the
libel charges to ascertain when the cases
against Mr. Marriott and others could be
Bet for trial, Air. Robertson arose and said
he desired to make a few remarks in the
presence of the court and in the hearing
of his fellow-jurors.
No objection being interposed, Mr.
Fiobertson continued:
"In view of a lot of false statements
published in a sensational newspaper yes
terday, I would like to say a few word.-* in
justification of myself and as a mutter -of
courtesy to the other memberÃ of the
jury."u ry."
Judge Daingerfield meditated a moment
and replied that lie was not sure. that Mr.
Robertson was in order to take up the
matter after the discharge of the jury. "If
there was any disagreement among you
and the other members of the jury lam
sorry for it," replied the court.
"Well, I wish to deny that there is any
life-iong enmity between me and the
other members of the jury," said
Mr. Robertson." That is absurd. I
have served with them on other juries of
which I was foreman, and have always
been on the friendliest terms with them.
This case has not disturbed our relations
so far as I know.
"I think it is due to our civilization and
to our courts of justice ias well as to the
jurors themselves to state that no attempt
was made to force me into agreeing on a
verdict, or compel me to agree with the
majority.
"It is not true, as has been told by the
paper to which 1 referred, that I turned
my back on the other jurors and read a
book all the time after going into the jury
room. I think I discussed trie case more
than any of them. I gave all the testi
mony full and fair consideration ..-a nd
argued on the evidence with other mem
bers of the jury. Â_ _ ,
"As to the statement that I offered to
have my throat cut and to let my wife
die of starvation before I would agree to a
verdict, that is all bogus. There was no
occasion lor that remark, and it was not
marie.
"When the jury came into court Satur
day night 1 understood the foreman of the
jury to say that I had rejected all honor
able suggestions for an agreement, and I
objected to it. I did net like the intima
tion in that statement and I protested;
but I understand now that he only said
he had made every honorable proposition
that a man could offer to get an agree
ment."
Judge Daiugertieid made no response
and Mr. Robertson said: "I can say a lot
more if your Honor wants to hear me."
Not receiving anj* encouragement to
proceel Mr. Robertson sat down and after
some consultation among the lawyers It
was agreed that the other libel cases shall
De taken up for trial on the 21st of this
month, the charge against Frederick Mar
riott, editor of the ' News Letter, to be
heard first.
During the entire proceedings not a dis
senting word was spoken by any member
of the jury, and it was evident that they
were in sympathy with the expressions of
Mr. Robertson, who has repeatedly de
clared in public and in priTate that he
voted from conscientious motives and be
cause he thought it his dnty to stand up
for the right of free speech, a rieht ines
timable to free men and formidable only
to tyrants.

EPPINGER'S PEN.
It Got Him Into Trouble and Still Con
tinues to Be a Source of An
noyance.
William I* Eppinger, wno has been
twice sentenced to the State Prison, but
whose case persists in coming back to
Judge Wallace's department of the Supe
rior Court for further consideration, is in
a fair way to get into deeper trouble.
The last time that Eppinper's affairs
were considered by the Supreme Court
they came up on an application to correct
a clerical error. The commitment stated
that Eppinger had been sentenced to the
State Prison for fourteen year 3 for forgery,
whereas, in fact, Eppinge'r was convicted
of "uttering and passing a fictitious
chpck."
Tne Supreme Court appeared to appre
ciate the joke that lay in Eppinger's ob
jections to b ing called a plain forger
when he bad shown himself to be aristo
cratic enough to "utter and pass a ficti
tious check." Anybody could be a plebe
ian forger. It took an artist to "utter,' 1
etc., so the -Supreme Court declared that
P^ppinger was not entitled to a nc? trial,
which would imply another chance to
escape through the meshes of the law, but
that Judge Wallace should resenter.ee
him.
When called before the court for that
ceremony fippinger presented a petition
for clemency. The petition contained the
names of the jurors, among them being
what purported :o be the signature of
William Steinhart, who was known to be
dead. In fact a lino was parsed through
the name and the word "deceased" was
penciled after it.
Eppinger admitted that he had written
in the name of Steinhart, but said he had
voluntarily canceled it, so he did not
think he had manifested a desire to
deceive the court. He might have let it
stand if that had been his intention.
Judge Wallace seemed to ti.ink that a
man who uttered a fictitious check might
attempt to ioist a fabricated petition on
the court, and oostDoned the matter for
investigation, lie intimated that the peti
tion might be all right, but he didn't
exactly like its Jook?.
Yesterday Gaston E. Bacon, whose name
was appended to Enpincer's petition, ap
peared in Judge Wallace's courc and noti
fied Clerk Salomon tnat he had never
signed the document, and hrd not author
izr>ri any one to sign it for him.
Next Friday t.e case will come up again
ana Eppinjrer will b3 asked to give a
further explanation iv regard to his facility
in penmanship.

CITY'S JUST DEBTS
The Legislature Will Be
Asked to Assist in
the Matter.
Supervisors Passed a Strong
Resolution to That Effect
Yesterday.
The City and County Asked to Take
Proceedings to Condemn Laurel

The Board of Supervisors will attempt to

Superv'3or King introduced the follow
ing resolution yesterday which was passed
to print:
Whereas. The creditors of thi* City and
Couuty who furnished in the year 1893 goods,
wares and merchandise for the support and
maintenance of the municipal government in
all its branches were, by reason of expendi
tures made by independent departments of
the government largely in excess of their ap
propriations, refused payment on account of
the funds of said year being exhausted; and
whereas, the Supreme Court, in sanctioning
these expenditures, in addition decided that
by reason thereof the goods, wares and mer
chandise bo furnished could not be paid for,
because of the expenditures exceeding the
revenues of said year; aud whereas, such ac
tion is prejudicial to the honor and reputa
tion of the City and County and repugnant to
all preconceived methods of common honesty
and alike discreditable to our County und our
citizens ; therefore be it
Resolved, That the Legislature of tho State,
at its next se>s:ou, be and is hereby respect
fully requested to take such action as may bo
in accordance with justice and fair dealing to
secure and insure the payment of all outstund
ing demands honestly incurred and rightfully
due to the merchants of the City and County I
who in good faith furnished supplies absolutely I
required for the conduct of the >rovernment, so
that this foul blotof repudiation may be wiped j
out and justice done.
The board instructed the Treasurer to

LEROY G. HARVEY'S CASE.
It Was Dismissed Solely From a Desire
to Avoid Notoriety.
It was stated to-day by one of the attor
neys interested in the case of alleged mis
appropriation of funds, recently dis
missed, against Leroy G. Harvey, that the
dismissal was solely the result of the
plaintiffs' desire to avoid notoriety.
"Ho restitution of any kind was made,"
said the attorney, "and no compromise or
even an attempt at compromise has been
thought of. Mr. Harvey was the intimate
friend of Mrs. Smith's husband and later
the trusted manager of tne estate of the
widow and daughter. Under these cir
cumstances the examination of the plain
tiffs would necessarily develop all kinds of
family reminiscences, which the plain tiff â Â»
consider too sacred to be aired in court
and from which th6y very naturally
wished to be protected.
"Mrs. Smitn and Miss Maud Smith
stated the whole matter in their Jetter to
District Attorney Barnes, in which they
said that they had come to the conclusion,
in view of the dismissal of the first charge
in Judge Bahrs' court, that they aid not
wish to proceed with another charge, as
the result would probably be the same.
The business relations " between Mr.
Harvey and the plaintiffs are exactly the
same as they were when tha suits were
filed. He has done nothing by way of
bringing about a restoration of what they
claim he had invested contrary to their
wishes. Mrs. Smith and daughter con
sider the unpleasant ordeal of a trial or
trials a far greater hardship than their
alleged losses. ' :

Some Beautiful Specimens From Siaki

C. Meyer of Siskiyou County, wbo runs
a mine near Siskiyou belonging to John jtf.
Daggett, Suoerihtendent of the Mint in
this City, called, on Secretary Filcher of
the State Board of Trade yesterday with
some very rich specimens taken lroin his
mine. The specimens shown are quartz
containing iree gold in the shape of
leaves.
"There is any quantity of this kind of
rock up there," said Mr. Meyer, "and if
you will provide a case I will send you
$4000 worth to place on exhibition in your
rooms, but you must put them in a safe at
night."
The secretary informed him that Mr.
Daggett had offered under the same con
ditions to loan $6090 worth of specimens.
The secretary stated that he would en
deavor to obtain a safe and case in order
that these exhibits showing the richness
of Siskiyou may be placed where the pub
lic can see them.

BOYS FOR THE NAVY,
Those of California Are Better Men
tally and Physically Then Those
of the East.
It is probable that during tne present
session of Congress an appropriation will
be made to erect the buildings on Qoat
Island in which the Naval School for
Boys is to be established, and that the
work of construction will be commenced
within six months.
The buildings will be erected uear the
little cove on the eastern end of the island
and not far from the present Government
wharf. For discipline afloat the Pensaco
la it is thought will be secured from the
Secretary of the Navy.
In anticipation of the establishment of
this school the Secretary of the Navy
{rave the commander of the receiving-ship
Independence at Mare Island permission
to take on a number of apprentices, and
tnese are receiving instructions which will
be of great service to them when tney are
ready to be transferred to the naval
school. The purpose of the school will be
to furnish sailors, capable and intelligent,
for the United States navy. Quite a num
ber of boys have already been taken on
and it in a remarkable fact that the Cali
fornia boys show a much greater percent
age, mentally and physically, than those
of the East do.
It is a strange fact that the right band,
which is more sensible to the touch man
the left, is less sensible than the latter io

HOW THEY SUCCEEDED.
The Experience of Others Should Be a
*jt ft: 3 Valuable Thing; for Us.
How many people we meet ihese days
who complain of tired, worn out feelities
and seem to be very much "under the
weather." There seems to be an epidemic
of ill-health and an unusually large num
ber of people are feeling and looking weak
and sickly. Bat there is fortunately a
way to overcome these miserable feelings
and regain lost health and strength.
Thousands of people have discovered this
way and many of them are giving others
the benefit of their experience. \ Here is an
interesting opinion on the subject:
Mr. E. B. Toale of 432 De Kaib avenue,
Brooklyn, says: "In the spring and sum
mer 1 was formerly a constant sufferer
from weakness and nervous, debility. I
tried many remedies but obtained no re
lief until I began taking Duffy's Pure
Malt Whiskey. Since I commenced using
it mv friends are astonished at my im
proved appearance."
The above opinion has been selected
from thousands of others, all testifying to
the same effect. It proves beyond any
question that for building up the system
and imparting new life to weak, weary
people, Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey is sim
ply unequaled. It purifies the blood,
quickens the circulation, promotes diges
tion, cures constipation and gives new life
to every part of the body. . All grocers and
druggists keep Duffy's Pure Malt, but in
purchasing, core should be taken to guard
against inferior imitations ..'- â â â .., , â¢ â

fÂ§/fi 1:45 r, v. Saturday*^IS IT INSANITY
OR IS IT LOVE?
Contract Signed by F. W.
'=: Reiner and Ida
Blythe.
Â He Is Waiting His Examina
.V;;. tion Before the Insanity
i^^lll Commissioners.
Has Recklessly Spent a Small For-
J : ' . tune Here Within the Past .
V -. . â¢ Two Weeks.
Frederick W. Reiner, the wealthy com
mission'meivbant of San Rafael, whose
reckless expenditure of money recently
has drawn considerable attention to him,
.was taKen before the Insanity Commis
:sioners yesterday morning. As 'all the
â¢j â witnesses had not been subpenaed his ex
amination was continued till to-day.
;.â â¢*..â¢ .One. of the evidences of insanity that
:". --Tlrj.il .be. submitted against Reiner is a con
tract that he entered into Sunday after
. noon with Ida Blythe of 25 Grant avenue.
Â . Ida Blythe and Viola LÂ° Page were the
â¢. ,Ko \'crune women belonging to the Mid
,'â¢ jhta-y Plaisance with whom Reiner got in
-1 uated on the night "of November 24.
*. a spent considerable money for wine
aiter.he met them in the Midway and
took, them to supper. When he awoke
next morning he found that he had been
robbed. of $160 and he suspected .Ida
Blythe of taking the money. This led to
his arrest for exhibiting a deadly weapon
and- Judge Campbell remanded him for
examination by the Insanity Commis
hioners. "
Reiner has been confined in a padded
cell the Receiving Hospital since Fri
day morning. He has received many call
ers,..among them Ida Blythe. Sunday
afternoon she called, and Reiner immedi
ately called in two of the attaches of the
hospital and requested them to witness
..^natures of himself and Ida. Blythe
to a-contract.
Reiner read the contract, which he had
written himself on a sheet of foolscap. It
Tecit'e'd in effect that in consideration of
. $75 and presents, value unknown, Ida
Isiyt'h\e agreed to become the traveling j
companion of Frederick W. Reiner, and to
. be true and faithful to nim and owe al
legiance, to no man but him. Reiner on
: ia part agreed to pay her traveling ex
penses and to keep her supplied with
pocket-money and wearing apparel.
The contract was duly signed and wit
nessed, and then Reiner told IJa to go
away ana he would not prosecute her for
btehling the $160 from him. The contract
is now in the possession of the Sheriff, and
will be produced in court this morning. A
portion of its contents will be submitted
as evidence of Reiner's mental incapacity.
Judge Hebbard issued m order yester
day .morning that no person should be
-" permitted to see Reiner, and a notice to
? that effect was posted up in the hospital.
It was brought to the Judge's attention
that Sunday afternoon Reiner had given j
a check for $200 to some person who called
to see him. The check was cached and
$4.0 was paid to a well-known cate for a
banquet to be given by Reiner to his con
tract traveling companion and her friends
last night in the event of hii -discharge by \
the Insanity Commissioners. The ban- I
quet is yet a thing of tne future. When
searched yesterday morning, only $119
> was found in Reiner's pockets, which was
placed in the custody of the steward at
T placed in the custody of the steward at
me hospital.
The Judge also issued an order to the
, To ice Property Clerk not to recognize
any order presented to him signed by
Reiner for his property. When Reiner
was ordered into custody by Judge Camp-.
ibell Wednesday he had in his pockets
$108 in coin, a valuable diamond ring and
a seal ring, a magnificent diamond pin, a
gold watch and chain and certificates for
150 shares in the Harian Pin-Coupling
Company.
Since Friday, when tie was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, two orders signed by
him for his property was presented to the
Property Clerk. One was presented by
Dan Sullivan, who for some weeks acted
as clerk in Judge Low's court during
the illness of the incumbent, and
the other was presented by .an attor
ney. Both were referred to Chief Crowley
and the Chief declined to recognize them,
as Reiner was awaiting his examination
oa a charge of insanity.
Reiner, if discharged by the Insanity
Commissioners, is to leave for Germany,
as his mother, who died recently, left Him
a fortune, estimated, it is said, at $250,000.
Since November 24. when he first came
into prominence here, he has recklessly
spent a small fortune.
STAHLE MUST RESIGN.
One More Interesting Scandal
Arises From the County
Hospital.
Revels of the Internes and the
/ Nurses Are Not Viewed With
Official Favor.
When tbe Board of Health meets this
morning it will take np another serious
problem, lying beyond a doubt this time
within its jurisdiction. The City and
County Hospital, which hajÂ» been the
thorn in its side of every Board of Health
Bince that now tumble-down institution
was new, presents itself again with a scan
dal to be disposed of.
If Dr. Stnhle will not have his resigna
tion all written out for presentation it
â will not mean that he is to continue right
along at the head of the hospital, for he is
not. It has been decided that he must go,
and fnterno H. Gunn and four of the
pnrses are alreaiy under suspension.
It ail grows out of a mild scandal that
is reported nith different degrees of
exavity from different points of view, but
which has grown out of a laxity of disci
pline that has reflected against the superin
tendent and presents the reason for his
retirement.
The head nurse, Miss Patton, reports
the story in the first instance and in its
gravest proportions. She was awakened
a few nights ago by the rollick
ing screams and laughter of women
echoing with the deeper tones of a man
througn the hallways of tue hospital to
her bed chamber. Having dressed and
ilescended the stairs as rapidly as possible,
she declares that she found the young
interne running up and dovzn the main
t-jrridor with one of the nurses seated
Bp;;n his shoulder. The young interne
Vopped the nurse on her feet directly In
fr>j:,t of Miss Patton.
-Miss Patton reported this remarkable
demonstration to Superintendent Stable
and tie, after bearing both sides of the
Starr, dismissed it.
The matter was then carried by tbe head
nurse to the members of tlie board,
together with oiher stories of other lapses
which should not properly have v place in
a well-regulated hospital, with the result
that thp board not only suspended the
interne and the nurse figuring in this mid
night incident, but also three other
nurses.
These three are charged by Miss Patton
with as gross a neglect of duty as tbe
others. She says that while they were
enjoying the society of an interne in one
of the offices a patient was discovered to
have died, suffering with pneumonia,
wholly unattended, while another sufferer
from the same complaint was found lying
almost naked on the floor.
Miss Patton held her position as head
nurse in the time of Dr. Titus and during
that time was suspended two weeks on a
charge very similar to that which she
bring against the four nurses. The charge
was "found to be without foundation, the
nurse who made it afterward admitting
that it was not true.
There are those who say that the same
will be shown in this case. Among these
are Drs. Morrow and Doyle, internes at
the hospital. They support Dr. Gunn in
his very emphatic denial that there was
anything nearly so serious as is charged
took place, and are inclined to be severe
in their criticism of Miss Patton. For his
own part Dr. Gunn says that there was
nothing more to the incident than per
haps a littie breach of etiquette.
He says he was walking down the cor
ridor of the hospital while one of the
nurses stood in front of the door of the
nurses' room. He put his hand on her
slmulder and gave her a push before him
as a mere bit of pleasantry. She laughed
and so did he as he pased on. That, he
declares, is the head and front of what
h.Â«a been turned into a scandal.
However this may be, there is no doubt
that things have been running loosely at
the City and County Hospital ; that the
members of the Board of Health have
become convinced of that fact and, with
the energy that has so characterized that
body, they will begin an investigation this
morning tnao may result in turning over
the whole establishment.
It is altogether possible that these dt>
Some of the Principal Characters and Their Simple Utensils in
the California-Street Canivorous Colony*
velopments may resuit in the board re
pudiating the Training School for Nnrses,
about which there ha? been so much dis
cussion and radical differences of opinion.
"For my part," said Dr. Fnz^ibbon last
evening, "I cannot see how we can ever
hope to be in any measure secure a.ainst
sucb scandal so long as young doctors,
such as are the internes, are brought into
such constant contact with youne women
or girls such as are tbe pupil nurses.
There are over thirty young women out
at the hospital learning to be nurses,
while there are half as many young doc
tors. 1'
Continuing tne doctor said: "We have
heard a good deal about the lax discipline
out at the hospital aud the boird has de
termined to prosecute a rigid investiga
tion, and it will do its beÃt to correct what
ever evils it may discover to exist, even if
we have to turn every official out of the
place."
Dr. Hart is the chairman of the Hos
pital Committee. It will devolve upon
him to take tne initiative in the prosecu
tion.
George Robinson, the steward, charged
with receiving unwholesome food at the
hospital, having knowledge of its condi
tion, yesterday sent in his resignation.

A. "BOEROWED" INTERPRETER
Collector Wise >â¢ itbout Any One to Talk
Chinese for Him.
Collector of Customs John H. Wise is
obliged to secure another interpreter of
the Chinese language. He has had lots of
trouble with his interpreters ever since
Dick Williams was arrested for crooked
ness, while holding that position. Col
lector Wise, as soon as Williams was ar
rested, began to hire Chinese to act as his
interpreters, but the treasury officials
quickly came to the conclusion that the
Government would get the worst of the
bargain under this, system of procedure.
Last October Collector Wise received an
order from Secretary Carlisle directing
that he dispense with the services of the
Chinese interpreter and secure a while
man who understands the Chinese lan
gauge to transact the business satisfactory
Treasury Agent Major Moore. Mr. Wise,
however, retained the Chinaman, claim
ing that he was not paying the interpreter
from the Government's fund?. This did
not please the powers that be, and eventu
ally the Chinese interpreter was dismissed,
leaving Collector Wise without such an
Assistant.
He quickly got over this difficulty by
"borrowing" Interpreter Jones of United-
States District Attorney Foote, and he
has been keeping Mr. Jones busy for the
past two weeks. This arrangement did
not work successfully, as Mr. Jones was
doing two men's work and only receiving
one man's pay. Moreover, his services
were frequently demanded in the Federal
courts where he belongs, and his absence
caused much annoyance in the balls: of
justice. On the other hand, when he was
in the courts, the brokers and others
having Chinese business in the Custom
house were greatly hampered for the want
of an interpreter of Chinese.
â¢- Yesterday Attorney Foote put a stop to
the annoyance so far as his department
was concerned by bending a Jeiter to Col
lector Wise stating that he would have to
recall the loan of Mr. Jones. \ As the case
stands Collector Wise is without an inter
preter, although there are several white
men who speak the Chinese language on
h.s list of applicants. ;
Held for Forgery.
L. D. Savage was yesterday held to' answer
before the Superior Court by Judge
Joachlmsen in $2000 bonds on the
charge of forgerey. He is accused of :orping
the name of W. A. Dawea, collection agent, to
an orderon the Emporium for ss 75 for which
he received sroods. There is Another charge
against him which will be heard to-morrow.
Havens Won the Prize.
Charles I. Havana' design for the new Mission
High School has been accepted by the Board
of Education and he will receive the 5 per
cent of the cost of the building that goes to the
mc<'f">sful architect. \Y. O. Banks received
the second prize, which was $500 in cash, and
CahlU & Condon the tl irdâ s3oo cash.
Havens will give a bond that the cost of the
building be designed will not exceed $137,000.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896.
STEWED DOG WAS
UPON THE MENU
Wittkowski Had Only to
Whistle for His
Supper.
And It Came Running In to Him
From the Street on All
Fours.
OJd Discovery Made by Officer Me-
Currie in a Vacant Lot Near
California Street.
Hugo Wittkowski ate a dog. Perhaps
he ate several. He occupies a domain
which has a surface, certainly, Jf sparsely,
strewn with remnants of deceased dog.
On one occasion a puppy's bead was picked
up at one end of his lot and the tail of
supposedly tbe same animal was gathered/
from an ash pile at a distance of 100 feet,
viz., at the farther end of tbe same lot.
At other periods feet that would not match
have been viewed by somewhat unsympa
thetic neighbors, who have not yet de-
veloped the advanced taste for dog fricas
see or puppy stew.
Hugo Wittkowski is a tall, spare man,
whose residence will not be found in
any City directory. Yet, for something
like two years and perhaps more, he has
resided within 200 feet of the corner of
Kearny and California streets, the en
trance being on the north side of Cali
fornia. Just west of Kearny street, on
California, are several old-fashioned
wooden buildings, which are occupied by
various lines of business. Back of these
are other small and dilapidate structures
and back of these is a large open space of
ground, which is hemmed in on all sides
by buildings.
One of these buildings in tbe rear is
occupied by Hugo WittKowski, rent free.
Others of tbe structures in the back are
also reported to contain free tenants. In
trutn, here is a sort of gypsy paradise, for
the tenants cook in the open air and use
their houses only for sleeping rooms. In
tbe large area before mentioned, stakes
are driven and these uphold pots and
Kettles over a gypsy canipfire. Every
night tbe neighbors see the fire lignted.
From the kettles proceed the fumes of
something stewing. On tbe ground are
two or three, or perhaps more, men, who
are waiting for their supper to be done.
They are smoking pipes and seem con
tented, having solved the problem of
living at a cost of almost nothing. None
of these is Wittkowski. He has his own
cooking ouitit.
Around his file some of his friends
I gather occasionally, for he frequently ac
j commodates three or lour other persons
in tiie shack which he calls home. He
also cooks iv gypsy fashion, and some
times he cooks dog. At various times the
other persons who frequent the locality
have seen dead dogs aDout Once WiU-
Kowsbi was seen to emerge from his shuck
with a bloody hatchet, and the neighbors
afterward saw the plump body of a dead
dog prepared for cooking.
How long this might have gone on is
uncertain. But Wittkowski provoked
others by coming around at a late hour
and disturbing their rest. He claims to
have been a soldier and to have taken part
in many battles. A piece has been sliced
off one of nis ears, and he has stab wounds
and cuts enough on his person to suggest
personal participation in various encoun
ters.
Sunday Wittkowski was preparing to
cook a small, nondescript dog when Officer
McCurrie of the Society .'or the Preven
tion of Cruelty to animals received infor
mation which sent him to Wittkowski's
shack. There he found the carcass oi a
dog that had been skinned, borne one
had found the body of th<j dog in a pot
ready for cooking and had cut off one of
tbe bind legs to take to tbe California
street Police Station.
Officer McCurrie had quite an animated
conversation on tne subject of the defunct
dog with WittKowski. The substance of
Wittkowski's averments was tbat be had
killed the dog, but he denied that his pur
pose was to eat it On the contrary, he
professed to be engaged in preparing tbe
carcass for a friend living at North Beach,
who is a consumptive, whose name is
John Merk, according to Wittkowski.
Stewed dog is, so Wittkowski claims to
have found out, good for consumption.
Officer McCurrie looked all around the
place, anil made many inquiries of Witt
kowski and of others. Wittkowski said
that he had killed tbe doe by hitting n on
the head with a piece of gaspipe and then
cutting its throat. There was nothing
that could justify McCurrie in arresting
Wittkowski lor cruelty, for there was no
evidence on that point. A neighboring
bartender said that Wittkowski had a
record a- a large eater. .Recently he ac
complished the feat of eating three dozen
eggs at one time, according to tbe vera
cious bartender, and followed this with a I
gallon of beer.
Altogether Wittkowski, with his one
eye, his prodigious appetite, his numer
ous scars and his penchant for dogrlesh,
had made qui'e a sensation.
Last night tbe camptire in the vacant
lot burned, and three men gathered About
it while their supper stewed in a pot.
They are not dog-eaters, and they
shrugged their shoulders in silence when
the subject of a dog diet was mentioned.
None of them would speak of Wittkovsici,
who is feared by them when he is under
the influence of liquor, or is otherwise un
duly excited.
The property on which the dog-slaugh
tering has been carried on is owned by a
savings bank.
An effort will be mnde to have Witt
kowski change his habits under penalty
of ejection.
Wittkowski had only to whistle for his
supper and some dog would respond from
the street.
THE RAILROAD PEOPLE,
They Are Attending to the Business of
Shipping Oranges, and Will Send
No lobby to Sacramento.
Shipments of oranges to cities east of
the Missouri River will keep the wheeis of
the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe in
motion for some weeks. The product de
signed for the Eastern markets consists of
8000 carloads, reckoning each carload at
twelve tons. It may exceed this estimate
slightly or fall a shade below it. The rate
to Chicago or St. Louis is ?1 25 per 100
pounds. The crop is fair, botti in quality
and quantity. Snippers pain experience
every succeeding year, and will doubtless
handle the crop with profit to themselves,
after payinj? the charges of transportation.
The bulk of the output comes from tbe
groves south of Tehacnapi.yet the orchards
of Newcastle, Oroville and other belts of
the Sacramento Valley region contribute
consignments to the Eastern merchants.
The Southern Pacific people count on
hauling from 50 to 60 per cent of the Cali
fornia crop. Tne representatives of the
Atlantic and Pacific, or Santa Fe, figure
on getting from 40 to 70 per cent of the
business.
The raisin traffic for the season is about
finished so far as the transportation com
panies are concerned. The shipments
were lighter than the annual acreage, due
to the early frost.
The Atlantic and Pacific has opened a
stage line from Kramer station to Rands
burg, the new mining camp about which
there is so much excitement. Kramer is
a station on the main line east of Mojave
and is distant from Randsburg only
twenty-four miles. The stages make the
run in three and a half hour?. The fare
from San Francisco to Randsburg, includ
ing the stage ticket, is $14 85. Travel on
the Jine is reported to be brisk.
The San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railroad people are attending
strictly to the business of operating trains
and hauling passengers and freight be
tween Fresno ana Stockton. The road is
reported to be doing a profitable business.
The rolling stock available is sufficient
for the demands of transportation. iSonie
work is being done in the building of
stations along the ;ine of tne road. The
consiruction of tne roundhouse at Fresno
is gome nhead in good form.
Everything is tranquil at the yellow
buildine. There are no signs or whispers
of any change* in the compensation of
em; loyes on the Ist of the year 1807. The
returning prosperity has not sufficiently
returned to justify an advance in wages.
Word comes from a source high up in
the conncils of the corporation that there
will be no Southern Pucfnc lobby at Sac
ramento during the session of the Lfpia
lature. There is said to be nothing for a
Jobby to do. No affirmative legislation
will "be requested, and no adverse legisla
tion is :>nticipated.
Mr. Vining does not have in mind at

Horse Show.
The great arena where equine youth and
beauty will pass and repass in review to
morrow and for three days following is
ready, and all that remains is for human
youth and beauty to come and see.
It is safe to say that the lights of the
Mechanics' Pavilion will fail during those
four evenings over the lairest specimens
of horseflesh ever gathered on the Pacific
Coast.
It will be a band of b!ue bloods, with
not an entry whose line does not run un
broken back to some stable in Araby the
Blest. There will be the big draft fellow?,
those Hercules of their race, magnincent
in their strength, ana the well-groomed
Shetiands, the clean-limbed roadsters, the
hackneys, the single-step saddlers, and
the runners ribby and lean, but whose
speed is as the vinds in their flight.
Then there will be that colt of fortune â
that creature staled in luxury, whose
food is the goiden grain that grows in the
vale of Tenipe and whose drink is the
waters of the fountain of Helicon â the
polo pony. They will all be worthy of the
fair that will look upon their proud
prancings. Wijat a combination of per
fect Beauty â what an exquisite centaur, or
I cent a tire .is, is a woman and a horse!
I iSurely tue artists v: the classics stiould
have put the head of one of their god
desses upon the -huulders of a charger
and left i.er to gallop down the ages in
imperishable marble.
To-night tbe Pavilion will resound with
the tramp of thoroughbred boots as the
blanketed troops enter their stalls, and
1 on the morrow they will show them
selves. The equine disp:ay will open
with the eiaboraie luncheon, to which the
Governor of the State and staff and all the
horsey eentry will comeâ fully SUO
guests all told â and President Henry J.
Crocker of the association will bid them
be seated. And before this erand festive
board the blooded animals will paraae.
The four-footed exhibits will be judged
!as ioilows: Richard F. Carmen of Car
! mendale, Huntington, L. 1., and Reginald

I view and decide upon the merits of horses
j iv harness, horses in cabs, tandems, uni-
corns and four-in-hands; R. W. Rives and
Marion Storey of Port Chester, N. V., will
judge the ponies in harness, under bad
die, pony stallions and Drood mares. Mr.
Rives wiil judge tbe hackneys and coach

For the display of fine vehicles several
splendid carriages have been purchased at
the New York horse show especially for
this occasion, and the piincipal exhibitors
in this line will be George A. Pope and W.
B. Hobart. Henry J. Crocker's grand
chestnuts will drag the Talbot Clifton
coach, that gorgeous four-wheel creation
in yellow which the noble horsey Briton
left behind him. There will be many
others who will compete with their blue
blood teams for cups, ribbons and glory.
The principal event of the show will be
race or contest for the A. B. Spreckrls
cup, to be presented to the best and mos*
skillful amateur arivins four-in-hand
through and over obstacles. The entrie-t
are Henry J. Crocker, Joseph D. Grant,
Walter S. Hobart, Charles A. Baldwin and
George A. Pope.
Aside from the fnct that more and bet-:
ter horses have entered the lists for this
show, the reduction of the prices of admis
sion will make the Paviiion during the
four days' season a popular and general
place of public resort. Only a compara
tively few rows of seats have been re
served, all the rest being for general
admission ticket hoders. AH of the re
sprved stats have ben reduced this year
50 per cent. The general admission seats

HIS SKULL WAS CRUSHED
J. G. Cavanaugb, an Aged Dish
washer, Meets With In
stant Daath.
He Walked in Front oi a Mission-Street
Electric-Cjr and Was Struck
Down.
John G. Cavanaugh, an aged dish
washer, was instantly killed by car No.
1009 on Mission street, between Army
and Precita avenue, last evening at 9
o'clock. The old man, who has no regular
address, as far as can be ascertained, and
who is a pensioner of the Government, was
crossing ihe street when the accident oc
curred. He evidently did not see the
approaching car nor hear the ring of its
bell, but walked directiy in front of it and
met bis death. Hi-* skull was crushed, but
he escaped the mangling wheels.
Three persons, Mr?. Mary S. Smythe of
3016 Mission street, Mr<. R. C. Winters of
;SO9 Fifteenth street and R. E. Kenny of
917 Market street, witnessed the accident,
and all agree that but one person was
responsible for tbe fatality, the dead man
himself. Sergeant Martin of the Seven
teenth-street police station placed the
niotorman, L. Nelson, under arrest on a
charge of manslaughter. He was subse
auently released on his own recognizance.
An Kscape Captured.
George Williams, the petty larceny thief
who made his escape wfcile being taken to
Judge Conlan's court for sentence Saturday
morning, was captured yesterday afternoon
by Policemen Frank- McGrayan and T. L. Ryan
and Bailiff Kelly in his room at 112 Fuurth
street, while he was reclining in bed smoking
a cigarette. He was taken to the City Prison
and an additional charge of vagrancy booked
against him.

will be interpreted. The occasion is the first

XITW TO-SAT:
LIKE HYPNOTISM.
Habits That Appear Almost Hypnotic. |
The tenacity with which some habits
stick to people, or people stick to the
habits, is very remarkable, particularly
the tobacco and coffee habit. â¢
People act- almost a 9 if they were mi
reality under a hypnotic spell. They
promise themselves and friends time and ,
again that they will leave off when they
find health forsaking them, but they make
one excuse or another and keep on the
dreary way as if guided by an unseen
spirii'of evil.
â  Physicians realize . the uselessness of
treating a patient for any of the multitude
of nervous diseases so long as the poison-
ous alkaloids of tobacco and .coffee are
being taken into the system, even in
minute doses.
It is a simple matter to break the coffee
spell if the food drink, Po&tu'm, the health
coffee made by the Postum Cereal Com-
pany, limited, of -Battle; Creek, Mich., is
used in its place. This is a facsimile of
fine Mocha coffee in looks when brewed,
and changes to the rich golden brown of
old Java when cream is added. Being
made wholly of grains intended by the
Creator for "man's subsistence, it makes
red blood ; quickly .and is = fattening and
nourishing. The muddy complexion dis-
appears and in its place comes the clear
skin of health with . rich blood coursing
back of it. Many people are sick and do
not know that it is the insidious poison of
coffee that prostrates stomach and iiver
and causes it. They laugh at first, but a
trial of a week without coffee and using
food drink, Postum, makes one wake up
to a great big live fact. ; i : , . ââ¢ , tâ >
. The children can sip from papa's or
mamma's coffee-cup, if it happens to con-
tain ;Postura, and their little bodies will
grow I round and fat under - the nourish-
ment of the pure grains, but it is ,a heart-
leas proceeding to feed the tender bodies
on coffee,, as every one- knows the puny,
sicKly looks of cofiee-drinKing children. -
.Let people adopt healthful food and
drink, and "throw r/hysic to the dog?."
" "Just as good" .as Postnm Cereal are
words used to defraud the. public. â

rainfall, of melted snow in inches and bundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n - s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleli" means high t.arometrlc pressure and
is usually accomDanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may he expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions

NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 7.-Speculatlon at the"
Stock Exchange was held in abeyance during the!
greater part of the day by the desire to defer
operations when the contents of the President's
message to Congress became known. Until the
details of the message became public property the
dealings were of a hand to mouth character and
were confined mainly to room traders. At the
start the sales were generally concessions from
Saturday's final figures Tobacco and Manhattan
were notable exceptions, the former selling off
16.^ and the Utter IV*. Tobacco was unfavorably
intlue.iced by rumors of fresh com pet! on and by
reports that a decision in the courts affecting the
charter of the company won d be rendered shortly
and would be adverse to the trust.
K!ior:ly nfter the opening General Electric rose
11/4 to 33% Â»nd Laclede Gas 234 to 25%. In
s mpathy with these movements the leading
shares improved y 8 to 1 per cut, but the advance
was soon par.ia ly iOsi. The really decisive move
ment of the day took place shortly before 2
o'clock, when the details of the President's mes
sage became k own in the street. The reference
10 the trims >vas followed by a vigorous selling,
movement in Sugar, which carried that stock down
from 11GB/8 to 115, the final quotations being!
1 1 &y 8 . The fact that the car Trust declared the
usual quarterly dividends on the preferred and
common Â«toeÂ«; was ignored by the trading element
who sold freely all the way down.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lv., Dec. 6.â The market looked
quite discouraging to a holder of wheat this morn
ing. Scarcely a scrap of the news afforded him
any comfort, and to make affairs worse the price
on the curb was off iyÂ«c from Saturday, so that
that much was a dead loss, without opportunity of
profiting by intervening quotations. The princi
pal source of weakness was the Liverpool market,
which declined 34 to Id. Supplementary influ
ences were reported, rains in India, heavy North
western receipts, 1048 car*, against 400 lust Mon
day and 1260 a year agoâ an estimate by the Lon
don Times that the crop of Great Britain would be
0,000,000 bushels greater inau last year, an In
crease on the amount of ocean passage of 660,000
busnels.
Tne world's shipments were large at 80.037,000
busheln. Chicago received 36 cars and inspected
out 244,010 bushels. The visible supply decreased
2,602.000 bushels. The falling off was beyond
the most extravagant estimates, and yet the
prices were benefited but little. 1 The English visi
ble supply increased \ 610.000 bushels. Closing
Paris and Antwerp cables were unchanged to
higher. Berlin was lower. Export clearances
amounted to 622,933 bushels. May wheat opened
from 81c to 80<ygc, sold beiween dlfcÃiy 8 c and
80c, closing at bO6/ 3 c, %@l%c under Saturday.
Estimated receipts lor to-morrow 240 cars. â  No. 2
spot wheat ranged from 89c to tÂ»o34c, closing
about 895 340.3 40.
CuR â .t could not very well be supposed that
wheat would break as hard as It did without drag
ging corn with it. The market for the latter
opened - weak, and under tbe effect of tbe dull
ness and the depressed tone of wheat was unable
to make much progress in the way of recovery.
Receipts were 296 cars and 285,991 bushels w*re
withdrawn from sore. The amount on ocean pas
sage increased 480,000 bushels. Liverpool cables
were quiet and unchanged. The visible supply de
creased 823,000 umhels. Export clearances were
liberal at 569,653 bushels. Ma' corn opened at
Â£6c, sold between 26VgC and 205-gc, closing at 26@
26V'gC. V's c under Saturday. Estimated receipts
for 10-m'orrow 500 cars.
OATSâ As lower prices were prevalent in the
other grains, Oats naturally presented a declining
tendercy. Trading mainlined ltd reputation for
dullness, transactions being tew and insignificant,
Receipt-! were 211 cars and 160,802 bushels were
taken from store. The visible supply decreased
177.000 bushels Exports amounted to 63,629
busheia. May oats closed i/8ci /8 c lower. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow .->Bb cms.
FLAXâ Was firm. Northwestern, 79c: Decem

PROVISIONSâ The first Information from the
yards to-day was of a weaker and lower bog mar
ket. Product opened lower on thai, bu later ad
vices of a full recovery at that p ace being re
ceived, provisions improved correspondingly. May
pork closed 2 1 ._>c higher, May lard a shade higher
and May ribs 2%c higher.

EIGHTH TIME
Frank Cheesman of South
Berkeley Tries Sui
cide Again.
This Time He Shoots Himseli
Through His Left
Lung.
Fear Expressed That He Will Not
Need to Make Another
Attempt.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 7.â Frank H.
Cheesman, a young man 24 years of age,
living with his parents on Otis street,
South lierkeley, attempted to commit
suicide /or the eighth time on Saturday
evening, out the facts in the case were
kept a profound secret until to-day, when
they leaked out.
Upon going home at about 8:30 in the
evening, he went to his room, and seizing
a revolver shot himself through the left
lunsr, barely missing the heart. The
bullet was removed from his back, and
now the young man is resting easily,
though doubts are expressed as to his
recovery.
Cbeesman was in the employ of Al
Wood & Bro., painters, of Oakland, and
after being paid off on Saturday night
went to a saloou and indulged in drinking
for a while. Going home from tber- early
in the evening he immediately went to his
father's room, where ne secured a revolver,
and, placing it to his breast, attempted to
end his existence.
At the report of the weapon O. T.
Bolten, his brother-in-law, rushed into
the room and found Cheesman writhing
on the floor. Between gasps he said: "I
have shot myself. What's the use of
livine? No one cares forme. I can't live
on small wares."
Thii attempt to cut off his exist
ence, which may yet prove to be his
final one, *s the last of a sories of eight
,-imiiar efforts.
Four years ago. he jumped from a win
dow in San Francisco on an electric
light wire, hoping thereby to electrocute
himself. His next effort was on a ferry
boat. When opposite Goat Island he was
. peeo to be preparing for a leap overboard.
Hi was stopped, however, and was then
turned over to the harbor police. On his
way to the station he jabbed himself in
tbe neck with a pocket-knife, but the
wound did rot prove to be serious. Alter
being in the cell for a while he hanged
hnnÂ«elf with a pair of suspenders, bat was
fonnd before life was extinct.
Nex'. be tried to kill himself by poison
ing. It was a failure.
lie then threw himself from a windmill
tank. Failing to end his existence in this
wire he tried strangulation by means tf
a handkerchief.
Stiil later he was put under arrest under
"the charge of having attempted to shoot
his wife. After this he lived qnietlv for
â¢>i while, when one day he was arrested on
the charge of attempting to cut the throat
of. a woman in San Francisco. Being re
leabed from this charce ho was committed
to the insane asylum at Ukiah, where he
remained for a few months. He then
.â â hipped on a man-of-wai and is reported
ti> have deserted when in port at San
His mother states that when about 7
years of age he was run over by a fractious
horse and injured about the head. To
these injuries are ascribed his mental con
dition.
Cheesman is at times very quiet and
inoffensive, then suddenly he will lose
control of himself and will commit such
rash acts as have been mentioned.
Death of Oicar Desk n.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 7.â Oscar Deak
in, the w il-known artist, died at his resi
dence on Telegraph .-.venue yesterday af
ternoon of consumption, after a lingering
illness. The deceased was in his thirtieth
year, wa< a native of Indianapolis, and
had lived in South Berkeley for about nve
years.
Will Publish. Their Annual.
BERKELEY, Cal., D?c 7.â The junior
clas-s o: the State University, after several
weeks of uncertainty, decided to-uay to
publish a "Blue and Gdid." They agreed
to furnish Manager Mott with $500 by
January 25 and to absolve him from all
responsibility should a deficit be incurred.
Manager Alott had informed the class that
he would resign from his position to
night unless they agreed to see tbe pub
lication through.
Called a Pastor.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 7.â The Uni
tarian Society of Berkeley has called Rev.
M. M. Crooker of Helena, Montana, to fill
the v.-icancy in their pulpit which will be
made January 1 by the resignation of Rev.
Edward B. Payne. R v. Mr. Crooker is
about 45 years of age, is said to be a man
of more than ordinary ability and of wide
experience. His wile is also a pastor, and
for several yenrs preached at Pasadena,
where she received a salary of $2000 a
year. It will not be known until the end
of the present week whether the call will
be accepted.
Another Globe-Trotter.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 7.â Richard J.
Vincent who beari the sobriquet of
"Louis Mornington, the boy globe-trot
;er," is in town. Vincent says that he is
not 16 yet, but that he has traveled con
stantly for the last three years throueh
every portion of the civilized as well as
the uncivilized world. He is writing a
book on his exploits. He carries with
him a quantity of letters, papers and pass
ports from all the leading countries of the
world.
SUITS GALORE.
Alnuieda County Juries Disposed to
* Piace High Values on Limbs and
. \ Lives of the Public.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec 7.â The courts of
.. Alameda County are flooded just now
.' with damage suits and more are promised.
One of the most noticeable is that of a
man who sued for, being seven-eighths
0 damaged. His attorney, ex-Mayor Chap
man, experienced quite a little trouble in
convincing tho court that the damages an
electric car can inflict .on , a man can be
estimated with such mathematical cor
rectness as is expressed by the term
'"'seven-eighths."
The attorney's legal contention In sup
port of bis phraseology was thai, the man
Is only capable of earning one-eighth
of the salary that lie once commanded.
' 'Sa'm'-'Bsll 'McKec, attorney for the de
fendant, the Hay wards electric road, ob
Â° jected to the language, but Mr. Chapman
.â¢proved to the/court's, satisfaction that a
â¢ man who can only earn one dollar now
â  where formerly, he earned eipht. is. cer
o lainly only one-eighth a* good as. he was
before the* accident, and on t is showing
* ttyj case was permitted to go to iriai on
' liie original complaint. .
. Â° Tlje tendency of Alameda juries in dam
-1 - .Re cases acainst' the electric roads is
ero'wine more and more in favor of heavy
"â Yards to the plaintiff. Three Â«layÂ« ago a
man named O'Donneli .was awarded
{15 COO airainst the Havwards road for the
tilling of bis boy. Not long since the
. Howlands were awarded $14,000 against
. llie Oakland Consolidated, and about the
same time the Supreme Court confirmed
a verdict of $14,000 for the death of Mrs.
Redfield against the Piedmont road. A
case is now on trial, brought by L. W.
Murdock, against the Haywar is road lor
$20,000, and still another one has just been
filed, while the Kinnear case was compro
mised on Saturday out of court.
There have been many other fatal acci
dents, including the killing of the two lit
tle Booth children in West Oakland, but
although suits have been threated they
have not yet beÂ»n filed.
In view of a>l these proceedings, the
efforts of the Realty Syndicate owned by
F. M. Smith, to consolidate, several roads
under one management, and thus cut
down the running expenses, is viewed with
alarm by the public and by delight with
the lawyers. Superintendent Grim, who
has probably been the most eflticient rail
road man in this city since electric roads
were introduced and who is thoroughly
P sted on the requirements of the various
branches, says that no further retrench
ment in the way of manafzement
can be practiced with safety on the
consolidated road. Mr. Grim has re
signed from his position and will cease his
connection with the consolidation next
January and it is g yen out that there will
be no successor, but his duties Will be
added to those of Superintendent Rudolph
of the Twelfth-street road.
A TOWN'S LIBERTY.
For One Week Emeryville Residents
Are Free From . Local
tain. ,
OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 7.â The Supervi
sors met thi.s morning and canvassed the
returns of the Emeryville election, after
which a resolution was carried declaring
Emery viile a town of tne sixth class. The
official vote showed that 150 votes were
for incorporation and only 38 against. The
first meeting of the Board of Trustees of
the new town will be held next Monday.
J. S. Colburn and J. G. Smith each having
received 111 votes for Town Clerk the
board will appoint an incumbent for the
forty days during which a contest must be
filed. If no contest i^ made by that time
an election will be called and the matter
submitted to the people.
For thi? week the town of Emeryville
enjoys the privilege, ii such it can be
called, of being amenable to no local
laws. The action of the Supervisors this
morning declaring it a town placed it be
yond the pale of all county license legis

ST, JOSEPH'S CEMETERY
Many Objections Against Dis
turbing the Graves of
Hall a Century.
Everybody in the Historic Town Is
Personally Interested in the
Attempt to Reopen.
Oakland Office San Fraxcifco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 7. j
A warm disc^sion took place to-day at
the meeting of the Board of Supervisors
over the proposed opening of the old St.
Jc-enh's Cemetery at Mission San Jose.
J. F. Caffney, who appeared for the pe
titioners, it was the understanding
that persons having property rights in the
cemetery were not to be disturbed, but he
has found that this course was not being
pursued. The opposition petition, he de
clared, was not acting in pood faith. He
was very emphatic in declaring that the
largenumb^r of burials said to have talcen
place in the cemet?ry is not borne out by
iactÂ«, many of the bodies credited to St.
Jo-eph's being in the Indian cemetery.
il lf these six thousand bodies," he said,
"which the opponents say are under the
ground were stood up shoulder to shoul
der the little patch could not hold them.
In 1868 the old church was destroyed by
an earthquake. This left a lot of adobe
which was spread over the cemetery j to a
depth of four feet. If there are any graves
underneath they are buried so deep that
the bones can never come to the surface."
Father McNaboe of the church asked
that the request be granted to open the
cemetery. He said ne was in favor of al
lowing those having unoccupied lots to
use them, but he would not be in favor of
opening new lots inside the fence of the
present cemetery. But if the people of
the Mission cesire to extend the limits of
the present cemetery by adding a few
acres of unused ground he thinks they
should be allowed to do so.
P. J. Bez said he pleaded for the widows
and orphans whose hu- bands and fathers
were buried in the cemetery, and said
that there was no one among the opposi
tion who objected to the ground on the
sanitary baMS. ''I say it is a shame," he
said, "to make the widows give up the
corpses of their dead and transplant them
thr -c miles away in a mirehole. We have
old pioneers there, men who can go back
forty years and teil all about this sanitary
trouble, and they demand justice. The
fact that the clergy live within twenty feet
of the eraveyard is the best proof that
there is nothing wrong with its sanitary
condition."
The Health Officer of Washington Town
ship has declared that the opening cf tne
graveyard is inadvisable from a sanitary
point of view, and Judge Scribner, who
represented tne opponents, also took this
view. Many prominent residents of the
Mission gave their testimony, and as a
compromise seemed possible the case was
continued lor two week*. The affair is
I creating considerable interest in the Mis
sion, as nearly everybody in that historic
town has a personal interest in the old
cemetery.
Webster-Street Bridge Unsafe.
OAKLAND, Cal, Dec. 7.â 0. H. Tebbs,
on behalf of the Alameda Electric road,
reported to the Supervisors this morning
that the Websier-street bridge is in a dan
gerous condition. The joists, he declared,
are so rotten that nails driven into them
will not hold. He desired immediate ac
tion, as the present condition is very dan
gerous, and the matter was referred to the
District Attorney to report on the powers
of the board in the premises.

The next notable event in the football
world is the first annual contest between
the two leading Catholic educational in
stitutions of the Pacific Coast â St. Mary's
and Santa Clara colleges. These two
teams will meet next Saturday at Central
Park.
This will be the first occasion on which
these colleses have met on the gridiron,
and as great rivalry exists between the
students, there is every promise of a very
exciting came.
Three times before have the colleges met
in baseball contests, and each time victory
was with the St. Mary's boys. The first

time was in the early 70's at San Mateo,
when Ashley and Cullen of baseball fame
formed the St. Mary's battery, and again
in iBBS they met at Central Park, and in
189u at Redwood City.
The two colleges have never yet met on the
gridiron, so the greatest excitement exists
as to the ou come of the first encounter,
especially as the Santa Clara boys will
make a desperate effort to regain tneir lost
laurels, but the St. Mary's eleven are de
termined to add another victory to their
list again t the Santa Clara athletes.
The Bt. Mary's boys are well known in
the football world, having sent forth last
year such wrll-known players as Mcllugh,
Hanlon, Mclsaac and Huff, who all found
positions on the athletic club team-'.
Santa Clara is quite new at the game, but

both teams are numerous and will be se

been in constant training ami practice the

tion Of th ir coaches, and are now both
anxiously awaiting for the battle.
"The enthusiasm of the students and
their friends," said Manager Gret-lpy to
day, "has reached a fever height, and a
scene similar to Thanksgiving day may
be expected by the spectators. The col
lege cries and songs will not tie lacking, if
practice can so prophesy. The alumni of
both institutions will attend in a body to
cheer on to success their youthful suc

JACKSON'S SELF-DEPENSE.
Two Witnesses A\ ho Saw rioientlneSnap
a Pistol at Him.
Arthur Jncuson's trial for the murder of
August Florentine was resumed in Judge
Belcher's court yesterday morning. As
promi-ed by Attorney Carroll Cook wit
nesses were offered who told of the occur
rences in Florentine's saloon at the time
of the shooting.
Cornelius J. Hurley related the happen
ings that led to the tragedy. He said that
there was some dispute between himself
and William Troy as to the payment for
some drinks, but he could not understand
thai Jack-on was involved in the trouble.
One of t'ae men told me other to go to a
warm locality and Florentine took excep
tion to the remarE, r-eeming to think that
it had been directed towaru him by Jack
son, wl o was sitting on a beer keg near
the door.
Continuing his testimony Hurley said:
"Florentine reached into a .rawer back of
the bar and took out a big old : lflshioned
Colt's revolver, and pointing it at Jackson,
with an oath, said, 'I have killed one man
and I'll kill you.' JackÂ«on jumped off ihe
beer keg and asked Florentine to put
down t c pistol. Florentine lowered it
below the bar, still holding it in both
hands. Suddenly he raised it and snapped
it twice at Jackson. 1 heard the click. It
flidn'tgo off. Then Jackson shot Floren
tine. At the time he fired the shot, Jack
son was backing out of the saloon and was
ne;ir the front door."
William Troy corroborated Hurley in
every important particu ar. He said that
when Florentine fell his pi>tol dropped
under him and he suggested to seme of
the folks that ifougbt to be got out of the
way. It was taken and thrown over an
embankment near at hand, where it was
found by the police officers.
Other testimony similar to that of Hurley
and Troy is expected :rom a witness who
will be called to-day. Ii the lawyers can
fiet through wi;h iheir arguments the case
will go to the jury to-night.

A VERY PECULIAR JOKE,
Two Men Treated to Drinks on
Money of Which One Had
Been Robted.
Footsteps Save a Butcher Carrying a
L-rge Sum of Money From
the Same Fate.
Early Sunday morning young Henry
Nellman and William Harbach had an
alleged join played on them that is not
laid down in accordance with the rues of
Hoyle. They were held up by footpads
on Green street, between Powell and
Stockton, and Harbach was pretty
roughly handled.
The two young men had just left the
Green-street Exchange, kept by Louis
Strohl on the corner oi Green and Powell,
and were going townward for a meal.
Midway in the block they weie held up
by two men and ordered to throw up
their hands.
Nellman quickly turned and ran back to
the saloon, but Harbach was seized and
roughly used. During the struggle in the
darkness, the gas lamp near by having
been extinguished, he was badly choKed
and had his jacket torn off. The footpads
secured 50 cents. Though Harbach did
not know his assailants' names, he recog
nized them as two Barbary Coast roughs.
When they Learned this they accompa
nied him bacK to the saloon and treated
the matter as a huge joke, usin,- the 50
cents in ordering drinks for the four.
They also pretended to be partly intoxi
cated, and one brandished a revolver sev
eral times. Both used very rough lan
guage.
The same two men. lay in wait near the
Green-street stables for George Faber, a
butcher, who liad $375 on his person at
the time. The men were prevented from
robbery in this instance by taking fright
at the footsteps of a pedestrian. They
evidently -knew that Faber was in the
habit of "carrying considerable money and
learned his pathway home.
Detectives Si.'vey and Egan are now
searching for the footpads und self-styled
jokers, and if caught it will go hard with
them. They have so fEr eludrd detection.

INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCH.
St. Ignatius ami Sacred Heart Colleges
to Meet at Fo >tball.
Sh Ignatius and Sacred Heart colleges
will line up on the gridiron at Central
Pam to do battle at 2p. M. to-day. For
weeks past both teams have bee:i prac
ticing diligently, and as they are about
evenly matcned a warm contest is ex
pected.
With the accession of several new
players, notably Tiernan as back, Shaw as
renter and Fanning as end, St. Ignatius'
eleven is considerably strengthened.
Sacred Heart College has a strong man in
Quinlan, its new center, who attended the
Law College. The winner of this contest
will compete with the winning team in
next Saturday's game between Santa Clara
and St. Mary's colleges.
St. Ignatius eleven, although but re
cently reorganize*!, has made quite a repu
tation for itself so far. It defeated the
Polytechnic High Sc.ool, and also tied a
team of Company B, League of the Cross
Cadets. An intercollegiate game every
year is to be made a prominent feature in
athletic sporta of Sr. Ignatius and Sacred
Heart colle es.
Following is the line-np:
Bt. Ignatius Collegeâ Shaw, center; Barry,
right guard; Fox, lelt uimrd; Svetnlch, right
tac*ie; Million, left tackle; Fanning, rlgnc
end; Freichle, left end; Breen. quarterback;

Away From the Post
Poorly, Hs Finally
Won Cleverly.
Dunboy Beat the Stake -Winner,
Zamar 11, in a Driving
Finish.
Summertime Showed Quality by
Downing Ostler Joe in a Hard
Drive.
The backers of the crack brown colt
Ruinart, the even-money favorite for the
third race, over a mile, at Ircgleside yes- <
terday, had a serious attack of congestive j
chills for a while. "Skeets" Martin had
the leg up and got his mount away so |
poorly when the barrier went up that j
stifled groans were heard from many |
quarters and the coin was considered j
roasted then and" there. "Skeets'' took '
after the Held and when, after closing up j
the big gap foot by foot Ruinart finally j
â won by half a length from Schiller the
crowd fell over one another yelling for
Martin. The colt, with ICO pounds up,
had assuredly the best of the weights, but
Martin is entitled to much credit for not |
getting rattled.
The Eastern visitors took a second look j
at the calendar to make sure that it was â 
not June instead of D^cember, so warm j
and balmy was the weather. Stylish turn- j
outs by the score passed through the gates ;
and a large crowd filled the betting ring I
and stand. Scratches were quite numer- i
ous, but tbe different events all called for j
the liveliest sort of si eculation.
Sixteen bookmakers laid odds, and as j
four of the five favorites got home in j
front they disbursed considerable coin j
among the glad talent.â
Quite a little buzz of excitement was
stirred up over the defeat of Zamar 11, \
tne stake-winner of Saturday, in the five- j
furlong handicap. Honig's 2-year-old with i
113 pounds in the saddle was considered a
"moral" and was backed down from 11 to
10 to 9to 10. He was slow to get into mo
tion and in a grueling; drive through the
stretch with the 6 to 1 shot Duuboy was J
beaten a neck in 1 :01%. The winner's per
formance with 115 j ounds in the saddle '
stamps him as an improving sort of a j
youngster. Suisuu led to the stretch but j
appeared to be "short," stopping badly at I
the end. Altanera fell ten yards from
the win, giving T. Murphy a bad snaking
up.
The Corrisran entry, Adolph Spreckels,
looked away and above the besj of the j
thirteen starters ior the opening mile run, j
Felling, and was rightfully made a 6 to 5
choice. Back in the bunch the earJy part !
of tbe running, he came on when straight- j
ened for the wire, and after having the j
race in hand, Murphy nearly allowed i
Martin, on Last Chance, to nip him out,
â winning by but the shortest of heads.
Pollock, an outsider, was a good third.
The conditions of the third event allowed
Ruinart to get in at 100 pounds, and on
his splendid showing in Saturday's race I
he figured an "airtight." The coin went \
in on him in big wad?, cutting his odds |
from 3t05 to evens. As usual, when the j
barrier was lifted lie was clumsy in get
ting away, and around the first turn was
six or seven lengths behind his field. !
Gradually overtaking: Libertine and j
Schiller, the leaders, he proved a handy
winner at tlie stand, with Schiller, :i 25 to
1 outsider, finishing in the place, a length
ahead of Karasin. The mile was covered
in 1:41 V^.
The lourth event at six furlonss was run
with light welter-weights up. On account :
of his roguisii antics at the post Lucky '
Dog was barred in the Detting, which
made Tampa, apparently the next best of
the company, a4to 5 favorite. The Dog
won in romping fashion by over a length,
and Tampa secured the place quite as eas
ily from Miss Cunningham.
Another hot favorite gave her support- i
ers a big scare in the final event on the j
card, a seven-furlong selling affair, j
Â±Jacked from J to 5 down to 1 to 2 in short j
order. Summertime wanted to stay at the
jost when the barrier was lifted and all
sorts of bets were made that she would
not be in the money at the wire. How
ever, Slaughter sent her along, and rer.cli- j
ing the stretch she had passed all but i
Ostler Joe. The black horse from Mon- j
tana uave her a very husky argument, but !

BEATEN AND ROBBED.
Charles Wagner of Oakland Sleets With
lioujh Treatment in a Second-
Street Saloon.
An old man, haUess and with his nose
swollen and covered with blood, was
observed staggering along Geary street,
near Grant avenue, by Policeman W.
Dinan about 8 o'clock last night.
Dinan went up to him and discovered
that his trousers were cut at the right
pocket and the rocket was hanging
empty in front of him. .The man was
considerably under the influence of
liquor and it took several minutes before
Dinan could eet any information out of
him.
He said his name was Charles Wagner
and that be lived in Oakland. He had
been connected with the Alaska Commer
cial Company for the past twenty years.
In explanation of his battered condition
he said he had been in a saloon on Second
street, near Market, and got into a right,
but he remembered very little about it.
He had considerable money with him,
and he must have been robbed, as it was
in the pocket that had been cut.
Dinan, alter listening to the man's story,
led him down to Sierra and Market streets,
but he could not identify the saloon where
he said he had been battered and roboed.
He pointed to a wholesale liquor-house
which was closed and said he thought it
must have been there, and then he chanced
his mind an 1 said it was somewhere else,
but he could not say where.
Wagner was taken to police headquar
ters, and Detective Silvey took him in
hand and will endeavor to liiul out where
and by wbom he was beaten and robbed.
VALENCIA STREET NEXT.
The Basalt Blocks to BÂ« Removed and
Bitumen Substituted.
Valencia street, from Market to Twenty
eighth, is down on the commercial chart
for a business street, and in order to have
it come up to the modern standard it is
proposed to nave the old basalt block pave
ment removed and a bitumen pavement
substituted. In consequence of the im
poverished condition of the street fund,
the property-owners propose to bear one
half of the expense provided the tax
payers bear the other half. In addition
to this it is proposed to discontinue the
use of gas lamps and swing electric arc
lights in the center of the street. One at
each crossing will, it is claimed, do away
with eight gas lights.
By figuring the expense the City will be
the gainer, as each gas light cost 12 cents
per light where the arc light only cost 55
cents, thus reducing the expense on each
biucic 18 cents per night, besides the im
proved illumination produced by the su
perior light of electricity.
Sub-committees of two men to each
block will, during the present week, ascer
tain from the property-owners and store
keepers their views on the subject and
then a petition will be presented to the
Supervisors to make the improvements
des.red.

MORE PACTS OF THE FAKE
Long Green Lawrence Left in the Breach as the
Man Who Procured the Selection
of Wyatt Earp.
Statements Made by Gibbs and Groom Flatly Contradicted by Editors
Simpson and Bunkerâ Earp's Appointment Was Privately
Made Several Days Before the Fight.
The part played by the Examiner's man
ager in the recent prize-fight is in keepinc
with his attempt to blackmail in Sacra
mento. Every hour is developing new
evidence adding strength to the suspicion
to which his connection with the selection
of Earp has given rise. If Mr. Hearst
desires to be consistent he should, for this
latest exploit, promote Long Green to the
KEW TO-DAT.

ON THE ROAD TO ARIZONA!
vacancy caused by the emigration of Mr.
Hawley, that of "publisher." It would
be as forcible a way of telling the public
that Lawrence was authorized to collect
cash in advance for the indorsement or
the silence of the Monarch of the FaKers
as was his promotion from the ranks of
the reporters to the chair of the managing
editor.
It was learned last night that the hand
full of conspirators who arranged the clot
whereby the betting public were swindled,
had announced to their friends several
days before the fight that Wyatt Earp
would be the referee. It is aJso believed
that Lynch, the managing editor for Mr.
Sharkey, had some kind of an interest in
the National Club on the night of the
light, for he stood at the door and kept a
watchful eyÂ°. on the tickets. On one
occasion Mr. Gibbs, one of the half dozen
members of tne club, desiring to pass in a
friend, took the friend to Lyncn and ex
plained that he was "one of the boys and
all right" and Lynch gave him permis
sion to enter without a ticket.
Lynch's reputation is very shady. He
came here with a lot of racehorses and
called ihem the "Arizona Stable." Earp
was then in Arizona. Lynch's methods
of horseracing, while they might be popu-
Jar in Arizona, did not suit the manage
ment of the Ingleside track, and they
ruled Jiis horses off.
On another occasion about two years
ago some racehorses were poisoned at the
Bay District, track, and Lynch was sus
pected of knowing something about, it.
The matter came up In court, but no re
ult was attained, lie was also mixed up
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896.
in some baseball deal, but they got on to
his curves.
Danny Needham figured in a fight here
two years ago and was' knocked out by
Boston Smith. When Danny went the
next day to the bank to collect a $3000
check payment was withheld. He had
got the double cross.
Long Green Lawrence, Gunfighter Earp,
Arizona StaDle Lynch and Danny Need
ham are birds of a similar feather. It is
expected that they will fly together in the
spring to more congenial climes.
In their statement, by typewriter in the
Examiner editorial-rooms, and presented
for publication to The Call, according to
orders received from Lawrence, J. J.
Groom and J. D. Gibbs, mentioned that
City Editor Simpson of the Chronicle had
recommended the selection of WyattEarp
as referee for the Sliarkey-Fitzsimmons
fight.
Last evening Mr. Simpson, who had re
turned from the country, reiterated the
statement made by his representative,
Fred Stowell, the night before, to the effect
that both Gibbs and Groom were consum
mate liars.
"I never interceded in behalf of Wyatt
Earp as a referee or took part in any other
way. The fellow is almost an unknown to
me, excepting that I have read of him in
the papers. I once met him, when we were
introduced Dy Lieutenant Eaola. That
was simply a passing affair, which never
would have lasted in my mind but for this
false statement made by Gibbs and Groom.
"Whether Mr. Bunker of the Report had
anything to do with selecting Wyatt Earp
as referee I c!o not know, nor do I know
whether Mr. Lawrence of the Examiner
had anything to ao with it. But what I
do know is that the use of my name or
that of the Chronicle by Gibbs and Groom
i.i this affair was unwarranted, misleading
and positively false."
This prop falling from under the pretty
story concocted by '"Long Green" Law
rence, J. D. Gibbs and J. J. Groom left
Mr. Bunker of the Report to bear the
brunt of public indiguation against the
people who had anything to do with the
naming of Wyatt Earp as referee of the
fight.
Mr. Bunker met with a slight accident a
few days ago and has been in seclusion at
his home in the Bella Vista Hotel. He
could not be seen yesterday, but his sen
timents were voiced at his newspaper of
rice by his city editor, Sutherland.
They were not ready to speak for Mr.
Bunker, but they told their impression of
what had occurred.
Some time before the fight Gibbs in
formed Mr. Bunker that Wyatt Earp
would be selected referee.
This information was given prior to the
time that the two principals had endeav
ored to come to an understanding. Mr.
Bunker, with a journalistic idea ol being
first in publishing the news and all that
cues with it, immediately sent out to
secure a photograph of Earp for reproduc
tion in his paper.
Further than this Mr. Bunker bad noth
ing to do with the selecting or imposing
oi Wyatt Earp on the lighters, the club or
the public as a referee.
Bat, this vtry point, coming out of the
Report's end of this business, is probably
one of the strongest that can be brought
to prove collusion, fraud and the etceteras
that go to make up the unhappy mixture.
Gibbs was supposed to not decide upon
any referee until .Julian and Lynch re
tired from the held at noon on Wednes
day. Still, Gibbs was sure enoueh of his
ground to name the man to the Report a
day or more in advance.
As neither City Editor Simpson of the
Chronicle nor Editor Bunker of the Re
port have had anything to do with the
naming of the referee, then but Long
Green Lawrence remains.
Strengthening his position in this
matter, the manager of the Examiner has
held Gibbs and Groom up and forced them
into formulating a statement for publica
tion in The Call, exculpating him from
blame. That statement has been shown
as a lie from start to finish.
The two gentlemen, Mr. Simpson and
Mr. Bunker, who are mentioned in the
document, have had no need to send
emissaries around to show their position
and honesty.
It has been reported that Hearst has
heard a good deal about the connection of
his hirelings with the Fitzsimmons-
Sharkey liasco, and that he has sent word
to have the whole disgraceful affair thor
oughly investigated.
EARP ATTACHED.
Ho Guaranteed the Attorney's Fees
of Bunko-Steerers.
Wyatt Earp, who gave the decision that
robbed .Bob Fitzsimmons of $10,000, was
attached yesterday, a Sheriff's deputy
taking possession of a couple of race
horses that Earp claims are his.
The claim is for $170 45 and is that of J.
i G. Swinnerton of Stockton, one of the
| best-known attorneys in the State. About
j a year ago three notorious confidence
j menâ "Crooked Mouth" Green. Smith
I and Brown â swindled Farmer Brack of
Lodi out of $2000 on the gold-brick
scheme.
While they were in jail at Stockton,
after being held in $30,000 bond;, Wyatt
j Earp, the Examiner's special writer, ap
j peareJ on the scene and showed his
friendship for the men by making efforts
to get them released. He engaged Judse
Swinnerton to defend the bunko-steerers,
guaranteeing the attorney's fee. When
the men had been let off with exceedingly
light sentences, considering the gravity of
thir crime, Earp disappeared and Judge
Swinnerton never saw his monkey.
He has long waited for a chance to tie
Earp up, and the opportunity is now
offered. If it be proved the statement
that Earp has an interest in the purse is
true, an attachment will be placed on that
also.
EXAMINER BULLDOZING.
What Is Thought of the Monarch In
Los Angeles Baseball Circles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 7.â The part
taken by persons prominent in the con
duct of the San Francisco Examiner in
the disgraceful affair connected with the
Fitzsimmons-Sharkey mill accentuates its
tactics in its lats prize amateur baseball
contests, which finally resulted favorably
for the Tufts-I yons team here and brought
the trophy and pennant to this city.
The determination of the "Monarch" to
prevent a winning by the Tufts-Lyons
over the Alerts of Alaraeda and later the
Monarchs of Nevada was so notorious and
was pressed upon the local team in a man
ner so unfair and unjust as to call down
upon its head the imprecation of every
member of the team and ti.eir many
friends south of Teliachapi.
The bulldozing methods of the Exami
ner in arbitrarily ruling out the pitcher of
the Los Angeles team after it had com
plied with the terms expressly stipulated
by the Examiner management, was in the
nature of the last straw. The "Monarch
of the Fakers" did not stop there, but
went out of its way to viilify those friends
of the Tufts- Lyons team who went to San
Franciscp to witness the last two contests.
Opprobrious epithets were applied to them
without the shadow of excuse, and when
some of them applied to the city editor
and asked tor fair piny they were an
swered next day with additional insults.
These things were related at a banquet
given in honor of the winning team at the
Saddle-Rock restaurant, conducted by
John Brink on Spring street in this city,
soon after ihe return of the victorious
amateurs. Mr. .brink himself came in for
a share of the Examiner's shameful ani
madversions. At teast half a dozen of those
who spoke "roasted" the "Monarch " in
unsparing terms for its smallness and
meanness in this affair. It is perfectly
safe to predict that any person who heard
the remarks of the speakers on the occa
sion referred to will never touch any
event rnn by the San Francisco Examiner.
Stole Two Cheeses.
Joseph Mahoncy was arrested yesterday
raornine by Policeman W. Coleman, in his
room in the Acme House, on Market street,
and taken to the City Prison, where he was
booked for petty larceny. About 8 o'clock, two
cheeses were stolen from In front of H. Levi <fc
Co.'s store, on California street. Coleman got
information that ied him to suspect Mahonev,
and when he went to bis room the strong odor
of cheese confirmed his suspicion. Coleman
found the cheeses under the bed.

STOCKTON STREET
TO BE LIGHTED
An Improvement Club Was
Organized Last Even
ing.
Modern Pavement and Sidewalks
to Be Laid as Soon as
Possible.
Active Committees Created to Attend
to the Preliminary Details
of the Work.
Stockton street has fallen into line in
the march of Improvement, and it is likely
that by next Saturday night the residents
of the north end of the city will he agree
ably surprised to see electric lights from
Pacific to Green. The Stockton-street
Improvement Club was organized last
evening at 1404 Stockton street, and about
eighty property-owners and merchants
signed the roll.
The movement was started several
weeKs ago by L. Kuttner, who has been
hard at work ever since to accomplish his
purpose.
The first in the order of improvement
was to get the street lighted, nnd to this
end he secured the following signatures
to the annexed agreement: .
November 25, 1896.
We, the undersigned storekeepers, doing
business on Stockton street, between Pacific
and Green, do hereby subscribe our names
and promise to pay our pro rata for a period of
one year for seven arc lamps to De placed one ,
at eÂ«ch corner and one in the center of each
block above described, the emount to be paid '
by each subscriber not to exceed fifty cents
per week, to be paid weekly. These lamps are
to burn until midnight.

strong, corner Vallejo.
Mr. Kuttner called the meeting to order
and stated that the projected club
should consider the general improvement
of the street as well as the lighting there
of. The blocks to be improved are the
oldest in the City, but -within the past year
or more many new buildings have been
erected thereon and tne citizens should
keep pace with these advancements. The
cobblestones on the street are old and
worn out. A fine bituminous pavement
should take their place. At present traffic
seeks other thoroughfares. The sidewalks
are not the best and pedestrians travel
downtown on other streets to ilo their
shopping. They should be kept on Stock
ton street. By lighting the blocks from
Pacific to Green the benefit to the busi
ness of the street would be increased in a
remarkably short time. He hoped that
by next Saturday night the new cub
would nave the streets fully lighted" as
desired.
Alfred Bear was chosen chairman, L.
Kuttner secretary and J. Kitteman treas
urer. After those present had signed the
club's roll a committee consisting of
Thomas Mullen, John Wessel ana J. J.
O'Neil was appointed to see the other
property-owners and storekeepers and se
cure their signatures to the movement for
imnrovement. A committee consisting of
J. Kuttner, J. E. Kitteman and J. A. Rea
was appointed to see the officers of the
Merchants' Association and secure the aid
of that body in getting a reduction on the
price of street arc lights. It was decided
to create an executive committee of the
cluh to consist of the officers of the club,
the committee with David Lowenstein and
D. Donovan added.
The executive committee was instructed
to have the lights put on the street by
next Saturday night if possible.
