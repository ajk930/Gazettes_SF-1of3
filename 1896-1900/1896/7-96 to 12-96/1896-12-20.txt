A PRCBABLE VETO.
Siys That the Power of According

With the Chief Executive.
MADRID, Bpaiw, Dec. 19.â The excite
ment in this city and elsewhere in Spain
caused by the receipt of the news of the
action of tbe Foreign Relations Commit
tee of the American Senate, in deciding
to report in favor of the independence of
Cuba, is intense. A wave of popular in
dignation ha 3 swept over the whole coun
try and bitter feeling against tie United
States has been greatly intensified.
There is no denying the fact that popu
lar feeling is in favor of boldly defying
the United States and notifying tbe
American Government that Cuba will be
retained by Spain if it takes ncr last dol
lar and last man to uphold her
eignty. In the cafes and railway public
I laces the situation is excitedly discussed,
and everywhere the determination is ex
] re-sed to uphold the Government to the
last extremity in maintaining its rights.
Dispatches from other cities show the
prevalence of a feverish feeling among the
populace and it is the consensus of opinion
that it would take very little to provoke
trouble against the Government should it
show any signs ot weakening.
The Government itself, while deprecat
ing the action of the committee, main
tains a dignified attitude, and though
some uneasiness was at first expressed,
this has been allayed by the receipts oj
-dispatches containing Secretary of State
s statement tuat no matter what
action Congress may take on the Cameron
;on, the recognition of the inde
pen etue of Cuba rests entirely with the
executive.
It is stated that Spain has notified the
American Government that it Is willing to
go far to meet the view of the United
State? regarding administrative reforms in
the Spanish West Indies. It will, it is
said, concede at an early date autonomy
to Puerto Rico on lines lpid down last
year. When the situation warrants such
action reforms wili be inaugurated there
that will prove satisfactory to all con
.cerned.
These will include administrative au
tonomy, such measures of political and
economical autonomy as will be com
patible with the interests of the crown,
and a change in tbe tariff laws that will
conduce to the extension of the trade of
theidan^ with the United States and to
commercial relations.
Of course, the Government will not fora
moment consider any question involv
ing the abandonment of the island, and it
can be emphatically stated that it would
not dare to do so. The temper of the peo
ple is fairly aroused and any Government,
conservative or liberal, would be signing
it? own death-warrant should it even sug
gest the end.ng of Spanish rule in Cuba.
Efforis have been made to obtain
authoritative statements from some of
the Ministers as to the situation, but they
decline at present to express any views on
the subject. It can be stated, however,
that in political circie3 no idea of war
growing out of the Cuban resolution is
entertained, and it is believed that the
professions of friendship made by Presi
dent Cleveland and Mr. Oiney, through
Hannis Taylor, the American Minister
here, arc thoroughly satisfactory.
An important factor is the Cortes.which
at present is not in session. It is thought
that body might be compelled by popular
clamor, were it in session, to take some
action that would result in the overthrow
of the Government; but as it does not
meet for several months all danger from
that source is eliminated. Even should
the Government resign and be succeeded
by a liberal Cabinet there could be no
change in the Spanish attitude toward
Cuba, for upon the least sign of its giving
way to the dictation of the United States
tfte populace and the army would upset it.
Senor Canovas del Castillo, the Prime
Minister, has always believed that the
( Ã¼bati matter would not cause war with
tr:e United States, and he also believes
that the ranting of American and Span
i h Jinjto-s will fall on deaf ears when the
commonsense of the people of .both coun
tries has had time to reassert itself. But
he will maintain all the prerogatives of
sovereignty in Cuba and will not yield to
threats no matter whence tne soune.
Every precaution has been taken to
gu-ird against any outbreak of the people,
and it is hoped that the excitement and
md gnation that have been aroused will
subside without it being necessary to call
upon the military to suppress disorders.
The students at the universities are being
Homely watched, and any attempt at a
demonstration on their part will be se
verely "repressed.
All the newspapers here express tbe
most intense indignation because of the
unwarranted interference of the, United
tftntÂ»s with the rights of Spain. Some of
them declare that no Government would
dare to fcase a settlement of the Cuban
question "on- granting autonomy to the
i>land in view of the strong popular oppo
sition to the granting of any refouns
while the rebellion is in proeres-*.
They, therefore, contend that the Gov
ernment will be compelled to maiutsic â¢

Prime Minister Canovas del Castillo had
a long conference to-day with the Duke
of Tetuan, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
and Admiral Bergnerer, Minister of
Marine. Tfie subject of their de
liberations had not been divulged
officially, but it is rumored that they
considered the question of shortly intro
ducing political and administrative re
forms in Cuba and Porto Rico. The grant
ing of such reforms at present would
probably result in a reconstruction of the
Cabinet.
INSPIRED BY CLEVELAND.
Secretary Oiney bay* lhe JPretidtint Hill
Veto the Cuban Rmolution.
WASHINGTON, D. C , Dec. 19.âSecre
tary Oiney, being asked his opinion as to
the nature and eff ct of the proposed reso
lution recognizing the indep-ndence of
Cuba, said to the United Associated
Presses reporter:
"I have no objection to stating my own
views of- the resolution respecting the in
dependence of the so-called Republic of
Cuba which is reported will be lain before
the Senate on Monday. Indeed, as there
are likely to be serious misapprehensions
regarding Â«uch resolution, both in this
country and abroad, and such apprehen
sions may have injurious results of a
grave character, it is perhaps my duty to
point out that the resolution, if passed by
Lhe Senate, can probably be regarded only
as an expression of opposition by the emi
nent gentlemen who vote for it in the
Senate, and if passed by the House of
Representatives can only be regarded as
another expression of opposition by the
eminent gentlemen who vote for it in the
House.
"The power to recognize the So-called
Republic of Cuba as au independent State
rests exclusively with the Executive. A
resolution on the subject by the Senate
or by the House, or by both bodies, or by
one, whether concurrent or. joint, is in
operative and is only advice of great
weight voluntarily tendered regarding
his constitutional functions. Tne opera
tion and effect of the proposed resolution,
therefore, even if parsed by both houses
of Congress by a two-thirds vote, are per
fectly plain.
"It may raise expectations in some
quarters which can never be realized. It
may inflame popular passions both in tnis
country and elsewhere, may thus put in
peril the lives and property of American
citizens traveling abroad, and will cer
tainly obstruct, and perhaps defeat, the
best efforts of this Government to afford
such due protection. .But, except iv these
ways, and unless the advice embodied in
tbe resolution shall lead the Executive to
revise conclusions already reported and
officially declared, the resolution will be
without effect and will leave unaltered
the attitude of this Government toward
the two contending parties in Cu,ba. "
This carefully prepare 1 and emphatic
announcement by Secretary Oiney of the
opposition to the Cuban recognition reso
lution of Senator Cameron is accepted as
the action of President Cleveland. It is
considered as probable that when Captain
Larubertuu and Dr. O'Keilly made their
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 20, 1596-THIRTY PAGES.
I special trip to Georgetown, S. C, yester- 1
j day they were instructed to convey to Sec
retary Oiney the President's approval of
i his nroposed announcement.
It is regarded by many Senators as a i
i step in advance in diplomatic history for i
i the President thus to assert that he and
not Congress is the judge of when execu
tive action should be taken in the matter
of recognition of a new government.
Nevertheless the precedents seem to
I sustain Secretary Olney's position. When
j President Monroe, in 1816, recognized the
indeiendence of Southern Spanish
American colonies he did so without Con
gressional action, but previously sent out
three commissioners in a United States
: war vessel "to visit the several colonies,
inquire into the condition of things in
respect to the probability of endurance of
successful hostilities and then report."
These commissioners were not nomi
nated by the Senate, though that body
was in session when they sailed, but went
exclusively on the President's nomina
tion. On the report thus presented Presi
| dent Monroe recognizen all these former
j Spanish colonies as independent states.
Mr. Monroe on this occasion said: "As
soon as the movement assumes such a
, consistent form as to make the success of
j the provinces possible the rights to which
j they were entitled by the law of nations
as equal parties to a civil war have been
extended to them."
Reviewing this declaration the Supreme
Court of the United States said, in the
case of "Ford vs. SiiÃet," in an opiniod
rendered by Justics Harlan:
"But this rule breaks down in several
| places. The probability is a creature of
the mind, something merely subjective,
and ought not to enter into a definition of
what a nation ought to do. Again, the
success does not depend on steadiness and
consistency of form only, but on relative
strength of parties. If you make a
probability of success the criterion
of right in the case, you have
to weigii other circumstances before
being able to judge which is more prob
ableâsuccess or defeat. Would you, if
you conceded belligerent rights, with
draw the concession whenever success
ceased to be probable? And still further,
such provinces in revolt are not entitled
by law of nations to rights as equal par
ties to a civil war. They have properly
no rip Ms, and the concession of belligei
ency is not made on their account, but on
account ot considerations of policy on the
part of the state itself which declares
them such, or on the ground of humanity.
"Precedents are to bs drawn chiefly from
medern times. The revolt of tne Low
Countries was hardly an analogous case,
for they were states having their special
charters, not connected with Spain, e'x
i cept so far as the King of Spain was their
I suzerain. In our Revolutionary War,
I precedent was not all on one side. Great
i Britain stoutly declared Paul Jones to be
1 a pirate, because he was a British subject
under command from revolting colonies,
and- Denmark agreed to this. In the South
American revolutions the concessions of
belligerent rights were given freely by
neutrals, moit freely by the United
i States, and as for proclamations, our
Government went so far as to issue ona in
1838 "for the prevention of unlawful in
terference in the civil war in Canada,"
where no civil or military organiza
tion had been set up. The true
time for issuing sucn a declara
tion, if it is best to issue it at
all, is when a revolt has its
organized government prepared for war
on either element or both or when some
action involving the intention or fact or
war has been performed by one or both of
the parties. Here are two fac'.s, the one
political and the other pertaining to the
acts of a political body. The fact of war
is either a declaration of war or something
implying It, like a proclamation or block
ade, or, it may be actual contest."
Secretary Olney's statement was re
ceived in the House of Representatives
without any manifestation of surprise. A
few members thought that the Secretary's
announcement raised a grave constitu
tional question, and Person of North
Carol na commented on Its. "tone of in
fallibility," which, in his judgment, was
not justified by the first articie of the con
stitution. -
Moody of Massachusetts thought that
the consideration of the abstract auestion
which the Secretary's statement raises is
likely to obscure ihe question of the Cuban
independence.
Livingston of Georgia strongly dissent
ed from the President's position, and
thought if he maintains he may make
himself liable to impeachment.
Generally speaking, however, the secre
tary's position was regarded as -clarifying
the atmosphere and throwing a fresh ob
stacle in the path ot Congress to inter
pose in the struggle between Spain and
her colony. A careful canvass of the
House disclosed the fact that a good many
members have no clear conception of the
relative powers of the President and Con
gress, and were unwilling to discuss has
tily that phase of the interview.
The House is plainly not in a belligerent
mood. What it would do if the Senate
resolution came squarely before it can
only be conjectured. It is reasonable to
assume that it would pass it after a more
or less vigorous debate, but it is equally
clear that the House at present has little
interest in the Cuban question and that
the sentiment respecting the insurgents
has radically changed* since the last
session.
There is more than a reasonable doubt
whether the Foreign Affairs Committee
would report the resolution favorably.
To-day as yesterday members of the com
mittee were reticent in their speculation
as to what they might do, but there is a
probability that a majority would set
their faces against any action which
might embarrass President Cleveland or
prove a handicap to the incoming admin
istration.
The administration men in the House
do not propose to go contrary to the
President's views, while the Republican
leaders are not disposed to adopt any
course which might be distasteful to the
President-elect.
Dingley of Maine expressed the belief
that ordinarily interference of Congress in
state affairs only produced mischief.
Turner of Georgia maintains Olney's
opinion, and says that the business of tne
country requires rest from agitation and
excitement, and this is the view that
many Democrats and Republicans share
with him.
Various considerations influence the
members, the larger number thinking the
question should not be left for the new ad
ministration to sett'e, while others fear
that the probability of war would seriously
disturb existing conditions at the very
moment that manufacturers are antici
pating a revival of better times from the
adoption of a new tariff policy.
Manj' members who deprecate any ac
tion on the part of Congress which might
be construed by Spain as an unfriendly
act would doubtless be driven by the force
of popular will at home to support the
Senate resolutieh and do not, for that
reason, wish to be quoted. The intima
tion privately given is that their influence
will be quietly exerted to pigeonhole the
resolution until the session is too far ad
vanced to make its adoption advisable.

stated that hurry orders have been re
reived from the Navy Department at
Washington ihat all repairs on ships be
ing overhauled must be completed in time
to allow the ships to sail by January 1.
Many hundreds of thousands of dollars
have been spent here within the last few
months preparing the warships for action.
The vessels now at the yard undergoing
repair?, include the cruiser Columbia, the
ram Katniidio. the Marblehead, the bat
tleship Massachusetts, the cruiser Mont
gomery, tbe monitor Terror and the bat
tleship Texas.
The flagship New York, which has been
undergoing repairs at the navy-yard for
the past two weeks, came out of the dry
dock this morning and steamed down to
the Tompkinsvil c rendezvous. Here she
will take or. coal and ammunition and
with the Maine will sail south Monday.
The other vessels here will follow as
soon as their repairs are completed, and
the Montgomery is said to be the next one
to follow during the latter part of
the week. The objective point of
the 11.-et will be Hampton Roads,
where the entire squadron, with tbe
exception of those ships on duty at Key
West, will be gathered under Admiral
Bnnce's flac by the first of the year. The
fleet will be the largest and most powerful
aggregation of warships ever collected un

STICKS TO HIS STORY
Dr. Zerlueha Rtpnat* the Alleged Cir
cumttaneet of Maceo'* Death.
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 19.â Dr. Z?r
tucha, through whose treachery, it is
claimed, Maceo met his death, is in Ha
vana. In an interview to-day he explained
his relations with the rebel leader. He
said that a great friend hip existed be
tween them and t..at Maceo had great
confidence in him.
Dr. Zsrtucha denied the statements that
Maceo had received from the province of
Pinar del Rio a communication sent from
Spain by General Weyler, asking him to
treat for peace. He also denied that he
had any communication with Chief of Po
lice Labarrara. His friendship with
Colonel Tort was old and private. He re
pudiated the charges made against him
by Serranos, adding that he never was in
Serranos' camp, and that he knew him
formerly as a friend of the bandit Garcia.
He repeated the story already cabled
about Maceo crossing around the end of
the trocha by sea in front of Mariel, and
said the officers who accompanied him
were: Brigadiers Perico Diiz and Jose
Miro, Colonels Alberto Nodarse and Gor
don â the last named being an American â
Majors Alfredo Justiz, Piedra Penalver
and Ramon Ahumada, Captain San
Vanell, Lieutenant Francisco Gomez and
himself as surgeon, besides the negro
orderlies.
Macso was on horseb3cfc, with his
machete unsheathed, when he was struck
by a bullet from a Mauser rifle. As he fell
Dr. Zertncha rushed to his assistance, but
he dropped to the ground dead. Another
bullet struck him in the stomach before
he reached the pround. All the members
of the staff who were around Maceo at the
time were more or less seriously wounded.
Colonel Nodarse and Major Gastiz died
later from the effect of their wounds.
Lieutenant Gomez was also wounded in
the arm. His wound was attended to and
his arm placed in a sling. He tried to as
sist Z^rtucha to carry Maceo' s body, but
was again struck by a bullet and knocked
down. He then wrote the note that was
afterward found on his body aud con
cluded by stabbing himself with his own
knife, not Maceo's, as some reports have
stated.
Dr. Zertucha declared that after the
rebels had carried Maceo's body off the
field a statement was drawn up which
was signed by all the leaders who had
taken part in the engagement explaining
the manrer in which he had met his
death. Dr. Zertucha intends to go to
Spain and take up his residence in the
town of Ziscaba.
He will print in Paris a pamphlet, in
which he will attack Senor Estrada Pa'rna,
the head of the Cuban Junta, the Junta
itself and General Calixto Garcia for their
actions in connection with the insurrec
tion. He thinks that Maceo's body was
buried near Govea.

cavalry and two pieces of artillery, while
escorting a convoy to Bayamo, had six en

thirty five Killed and a large number
wounded. One wounded rebel wns cup

LONDON, Exg., Dec. 19.â 1n an inter
view with a representative of the United
Associated Presses upon the subject of the
resolution of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee of the United States Senate recog
nizing the independence of GuDa, a high
official of the Spanish Embassy says:
"The resolution is apparently an action
on the part of the jingo party in America.
Spanish officials cannot believe that it
will pass Congress, but if it does, surely
President Cleveland, judging from his
policy, will exercise his right to veto.
T"here is no parallel between the rebellion
in Cuba and Spain's recognition of the
Confederate States of America as belliger
ents."
In reply to a question as to what action
Spain would be l.kely to take in the event
of the adoption of the resolution by the
United States Senate and House, the offi
cial of the embassy said it would be im
possible for him to anticipate the action
of the Government at Madrid.
Baron de Courcel, the French Embassa
dor, was seen by the reporter as he was
leavins the office. TheEmbassador begged
to be excused from expressing any opinion
upon tbe subject of relations between
Spain and the United States. Both United
States Embassador Bayard and the Italian
Embassador, General Ferroro, are out of
town, and in their absence the officials of
their respective embassies decline to talk
on the subject.

A Description of tbe Affair in Its
Various Phas ot â Attorney Shfd
burat's Speech.
Under the glory of the American flag,
with the breezes that passed over Wash
ington-square Par* kissing its folds into
proud undulation, with the glad rays of a
December sun shining down and giving
light and warmth to the scene, a vast as
semblage of representative citzens stood
by yesterday and witnessed a spectacle
that means much for this City in general
and more for Kearny street, that historic
retail shopping thoroughfare that wel
comes as a prodigal aon the restoration of
a great part of its old-time prestige.
The occasion was the laying of the corÂ«
nerstone of the Hall of Justice, the new
municipal building to be erected on the
site at the intersection of Kearny and
Washington streets, where formerly stood
the old City Hall, with all the associations
so sacred to the memories of patriarchal
City officials. The ceremony was con
ducted in accordance with the beautiful
and impressive ritual of the Grand Lodge
of Free and Accepted Masons of the State
of California.
At 1 :30 p. m. the procession was formed
at the Masonic Temple, on Post and
Montgomery streets. A mounted squad of
eight policemen under Corporal Shannon
had been sent by Chief Crowley to act as
escort for the parade in honor of its rela
tion to the Police Department. This squad
took its place at the head of the proces
sion.
The place of honor was accorded to Cali
fornia Commandery as the oldest organi
zation of Masons in the State. It was pre
ceded by Bennett's band and followed by
Oakland Commandery.
Tliien in order came Cassasa's band,
â Golden Gate Commandery, the Royal
Arch Masons, the Masonic Veternn As
sociation, Roncovieri's band, the Master
Mason?, the Grand Consistory, the Grand
Lod pc and City officials. The parade was
niarshaled by Grand Marshal and Past
Grand Ma stei J. B. Stevens. Pa-t Grand
Master L.add of Oriental Lodi;e acted as
assistant.
At the Masonic Temple to preserve order
and keep the crowds back twenty men
under Sergeant Donovan had been sent
by Captain Splllane. They did their duty
well. Captain Witiman had fifty men at
the scene of the ceremony, under charge
of Sergeants Wollweber and Cook. Two
patrolmen were also tÂ«pt at each corner
along the line of march, wnich was
around the corner from Post street to Mar
ket, thence to Kearny and along that
thoroughfare to Merchant street, then
down Merchant and into the vacant lot
which is the site of the new building.

streets the various bodies preceding the
Grand Lodge halted and opened order and
the Grand Lodge marched through to
where the cornerstone was to be laid. Tbe
rest fell in and brought up in the rear.
The procession formed a most imposing
spectacle and lar^e crowds followed to see
the ceremony performed. With the Royal
Arch Masons was the golden Ark of the
Covenant upon a truck drawn by four
horses.
The sides of the lot fronting respectively
on Kearny, \Vashington and Merchant
streets showed a dense, unbroken line of
spectators at the beginning of the cere
mony and many crowded into the lot and
kept the police busy. The windows of all
the adjoining buildings were also tilled
witli people.
In addition to the various Masonic
bodies present at the laying of the stone
were most of the City officials and a ma
jority of the Supervisqrs-elect.
Dr. Rottanzi stood by and divided his
attention oetween observing the ceremony
and stroking his new and silky Vandyke.
Charles L. J. W. Pierce, grand commander
of the Grand Consistory, was accompa
nied by William Frank Pierce, inspector
of California, and Thomas Ilubbard Cas
well, supreme grand commander of the
Southern Jurisdiction of the United
States. All these gentlemen have attained
the thirty-third decree in the Masonic or
der. A. L. Fitzgerald, the inspector of
Nevada, was also present.
The Kearny-street and North End Im
provement Association, which has the
credit of having the new municipal build
ing located ou the site it will ociupy, was
out in force. The oration of the day was
delivered Ky Attorney George D. Shad
burne, the chairman of the judiciary com
mittee of tbe association.
Shadburne's oration preceded the formal
ceremonies- He was listened to with the
closest attention, and at the conclusion of
his remarks "nas greeted, with hearty ap
plause. In part he said:
My Fellow-Citizens: V.'c are standing upon
historic ground, made memorable Dy thedeeas
of pioneers of a past age, whose memories clus
ter around us as we, too, are about to perpetu
ate ihe history of our golden City. On such
an occasion it is meet that we allow to pass in
review at least some of the storied past.
It was predicted in 1854 that San Francisco
was destined one day to be in riches, grandeur
nnd influence like Tyre or Carthuse of the
olden time, or like Liverpool or New York of
modern days. Our City to-day proves the pre
diction true.
The bay called San Francisco Bay was first
discovered by the missionaries of St. Francis
about the end of the year 1769. The Spanish
Government, to secure control of the country,
directed that missions be established along the
coast. T/e lirst mission established was thai
at Diego iv 1769. On leaving that port
directions were given by the liispecior-Wen
eral as to the names of subsequent missionsâ
they were taken from the calendar of saints.
St. Frauds was not among the number. When
tnis was discovered by pood Father Junipero
he exclaimed: "W'hai ! Is not our owu dear
Father St. Francis to have a mission assigned
to him?" To this the visitador, or Inspector-
Generai, replied: "If St. Francis wishes a
mission let him show you a good port, and
men it will bear his came." So when the
good priest discovered snd entered the Golden
Gate and beheld our beautiful and capacious
harbor he at once named it San Francisco Bay.
The mission at San Francisco was established
in 1776 On the 27:h day of June an expedi
tion which had started by land from Monterey
arrived at Washerwoman's lagoon. I pret-ume
you hll know where that is; it is at the north
ern extremity of this peninsula of San Fran
cisco. Here the mission was temporarily
established. Subsequently, howevi-r. it was
moved to the uld Mission Dolores, about two
miles southward. A store ship had previously
leU Monterey wiib.arms, soldiers, families and
provisions. It did not arrive until August.
On the 17th of S ptember solemn possession
was taken of the Presidio. After blessing and
planting the cross the first mass was said, and
concluded with a Te Deum. On the 9th of
November a similar ceremony was performed
on taking possession of the mission. And for
want of uu organ they continually discharged i
firearms during the ceremony, and the smoke
of musKets supplied the incense. The do
minion of the padres was gentle and ministe
rial, and in a few years the missions had
thrived and multiplied to such an extent that
the whole coa-t. from San Diego to San Fran- |
Cisco, was under thi-ir sway, and the Indians
had become converted and had greatly in
creased in number and were fast becoming an
industrious and contented people. The-mis
sions continued in power until about 1845,
when the MexicanGovernment deprived them
oi their authority and possessions.
The Americans becsifl to enter California in
considerable numbers; the time was &.oon to
nrrive when Mexican dominion would cease.
The Russians were about the rirst foreign set
tlers in California, They iiad two stations,
one in BodegM and the other at Fort Ross, as
early as 1812. They were constantly and
jealously eveii by the Spnuisa and Mexican au
thorities, untii, m 1341, they sold out to
Captain John A. Sutler and retired from the
country. It soon became evident that Mexico
could not stop :he ;iow of immigration to her
Golc^nda. Adventurers from every clime
came into her ports, until iv a short time
the principal merchants were foreigners.
The Spaniards looked on indifferent to the re
sult.
Texans were now knocking at the door of
Congress lor admission into the Union, which
entrance was effected in 1845, and the Mexi
can wht followed in 1846, which lost Cali
iornia to Mexico forever.
Prominent ia the delivery of California to
the United States were Colonel John C. Fre
mont, Commodores Sloat. Montgomery aid
Stockton, General Kearny and Colonel Steven
son. Right opposite you'on the plaza is where
Commodore Montgomery hoisted the Ameri
can flag July 8, 1846, in the little town knovra
as Yerba Buena.
In the spring of 1848 the war with Mexico
was at un end, andCa.ifornia was a part of the
United Mates, but, as a matter of fact, her in
domiteble sons, led on by such men as Com
modores Stockton, Sloat and Montgomery,
General Kearny and Colonel Fremont, had al
ready won her independence. After the rais
ing of our National colors on the plaza, San
Francisco, then Yerba Buena, was continu
ously under American control.
The orator here entered upon a de-
Fcription of the discovery of gold in Cali
fornia, depicting with realistic language
and sympathetic gesture the early scenes
and circumstances amons which the pio
neers lived. To give an idea of the prices
paid for goods and provisions in those
times he gave the following information:
December 1, 1848, the market stood as fol
lows ir San Francisco:
F. our, #27 per barrel; beef, $20; pork, $60;
butter, 90 cents per pound, and cheese, 70
cents.
During the greater part of the year 1848 San
Francisco had been almost entirely deserted
for the mines. The school closed; the news
papers â two in number â censed publication;
and times in the village were dull; but things
were lively i;i the mines. Individuals made
.SSOOO, $10,000 and $15,000 in the space of a
lew weeks. One man dug out $12,000 in six
days. Tnree others obtained $SOOO in a single
day. In one instance rive loads of earth sold
for $750, which yielded, after washing, $16.
000. The common instrument first made use
of to dig with was a butcher's knife, so butch
ers' knives suddenly went up to $20 and $30
apiece.
On the strength of these successes and on
account of the scarcity oi supplies, everything
went up in price enormous.y.
Flour at one time sold as high as $200 per
barrel; eggs sold for $1. $2 and $3 each; in
ferior sugar, tea and coffee at $4 per pound.
Medicines wereâ say laudanum, for instanceâ
$1 per dropâ actually $40 was; paid for a
dose; and $10 was paid for a pill or puree,
without advice, or with it from $30 to $100.
Picks and shovels ranged from $5 to $15 each.
No man would give another a hand's turn
for less than $5, and the commonest labor,
when it could be secured at all, was from $25
to $30 per day. During this time many valu
able cargoes arrived in the bay, but the sea
men deserted for the mines. The goods were,
somehow, landed, but there^einu no one to
take care of them they weÃ left to be de
stroyed by the weather.
In the meantime real estate greatly en
hanced in value. Within the first eight
weeks after the "diggings" had been iully
opened $250,000 had reached San Francisca
in gold dust, and within the next eight weeks
$600,000 more. These sums were all to pur
chase, at any price, additional supplies for the
mines.
A great deal of tbe oration was remi
niscent and included word sketches of
General Kearny, California's first Ameri
can Governor; Lieutenant Washingtorr
Bartlett, San Francisco's first American
Alcalde, and Colonel Geary, her first
Mayor. In conclusion be spoke as fol
lows:
The Jenny Lind Theater, for the time, wrb a
magnificent structure. It could comfortably
seat upward of 2000 people and was up to
dnte in all its appointments. The following
year (1852) the City purchased it for a City
Hali, which it remained until the new City
hall was furnished and equipped.
The scenes that have been enacted here
would fill volumes, but we cannot tarry to de
scribe them; we have other work before us.
We are now about to lny tne cornerstone of
the most Important building in tne C.ty. It is
to mark a new eraof this northern part. For
several years the ravages of time nave been
markedly visible in ibis section; wear and de
cay have not been retarded or repaired.
But now new life is to be infused into this
district and ere long the ring oi the hammer
will make merry music for happy toilers and
yet more bapp; property-owners.
Now, having but poorly performed my task,
I surrender tne labor of laying the cornerstone
of our great Palais de Justice to abler and bet
ter hands.
In behalf of the Mayor, who was not
present, Supervisor Benjamin, chairman
of the Buiiding Committee of the board,
then made a brief address, and then for
the City turned over the laying of the
cornerstone to the Masons. Grand Master
William M. Lucas briefly res-p nided and
said it gave him unbounded pleasure to
inaugurate so important a municipal im
provement.
Then he handed the copper box oon
taining ti>Â»Â» articles to be placed under the
stone to Grand Treasurer Edward Cole
man. The Grand Treasurer held it ready
to deposit, and the stone was lowered to
its place by three stages. The contents of
the box were then read off by Grand Sec
retary George Johnson. They were as
follows:
A copy of the municipal reports for 1895-9(5;
one copy of each daily newspaper; 57 views of
places of interest in the City and County, in
cluding photographs of the Midwiutcr Fair
buildings; a pamphlet containing a descrip
tion of the property owned by the City ; ex
tracts from the municipal reports referring to
tbe old City Hall building; one of each de
nomination ot gold, silver and nickel coins of
the United States; a list of the officers of the
Kearny-street Improvement Association, and
one volume of the proceedings of the Masonic
Grand Lodge heid this year.
In laying the stone, which was a block
of granite a foot thick and four square,
Grand Master Lucas was assisted by the
rest of the grand officers. They were
Deputy Grand Master Thomas Flynt,
Senior Grand Warden F. M. Angelotti,
Junior Grand Warden Charles F. Patton,
Grand Secretary George Johnson, Grand
Treasurer Edward C^leman, Grand Mar
shal au'i Past Grand Master J. B. Stevens
and Grand Bible- bearer William S. Moses,
Peculiar is an incident in connection
with Moses. The lirst job he ever secured
in California was a piece of work within
ten feet cf where the cornerstone was
laid. He got for it $16 a day.
During the ceremony the choir of the
Grand Lodge sang the following: "Hail
Masonry Divine/ 1 "Place We Now the
Cornerstone," "Corn, Wine nnd Oil We
Now Have Poured," concluding with
"Praise God From Whom All Blessings
Flow." The choir was led by Samuel D.
Mayer and consisted otherwise of Messrs.
Ogilvie, Fleming and Jones.
A pleasant incident in connection with
the affair was the presenting of a beauti
ful silver trowel to each member of the
Building Commtttee of the Board of Super
visors by \V. H. Bodfish, the second vice
president of the Kearny-street and North
End Improvement Association, for the
association. The committee is composed
of Benjamin (chairman), Wagner, SprecK
els, Hir.-cii and King. In doing this
Bodfish, in behalf of his organization,
thanked them for their efforts to have the
work begun immediately.
When the ceremony was over the Ma
sonic bodies formed in proper order and
marched back to the temple on Post and
Montgomery streets. Here they disbanded.
THE STRUCTURE.
How the New Hall of Justice Will
Be Laid Out.
The building which will rise on the site
of the old City Hall will be one of the
finest of the kind in the United States. It
will have ail modern conveniences and
will be arranged to accommodate the
criminal business of the City. For its
construction $275,000 was appropriated,
with an additional f 25,000 for the furnish
ings. In a competition for plans Shea &
Shea were selected as the architects, and
their plans are admittedly equal to the
great wors. The building will be fire
proof and will be arranged to give the
criminal courts a quiet location, while the
prison, hospital and police headquarters
will occupy convenient and appropriate
quarters.
Instead of having the prison in the
noisome basement it will be on the top
floor, wnere it will be well lighted and
ventilated and also secure. The basement
will be reserved for an assembly-room for
the police, where they will be convenient
in case of emergency. In the center of
the building there will be a shaft 30 by 50
feet, which will provide ventilation as well
as light. The Receiving Hospital will be
on the main floor in the rear. Abundant
prison room will be afforded and provi
sion will be made for isolating boys and
girls irom old criminals.
HARVARD GETS THE DECISION
Defeats frinceton in a MoÃt Interesting
Itebating Content.
PRINCETON, N. J., Dec. 19 âFor the
third time in the history of inter-collegi
ate debating Princeton was defeated here
last night by Harvard. The debate was
listened to by about 1500 people, who
showed great interest in the discus
sion of the question, "Resolved, That as
suming the adoption of adequate consti
tutional amendments tbe United States
should institute a system of responsible
Cabinet judgment." The judges were
Joseph F. Hawley, United States Senator
from Connecticut; Professor C. C. Har
rison of the University of Pennsylvania
and Dr. Harailtoi^W. Mabie, editor of the
Outlook. Princeton had the affirmative
and Harvard the negative. The first
speeches were of twelve minutes length,
and those in rebuttal oi five minutes each.
President Pattou introduced Talcott
William* of Philadelphia as the presiding
officer of the evening. The first speaker
on the affirmative was H. H. Yocum of
Princeton, who showed in the pres
ent system of government the lack both
of responsibility and ol efficient leader
ship in legislation, and thai these are due
to a confusing system of committees in
both houses.
S. R. Wrightington of Harvard then
opened the case for the negative by stat
ing that fhe aaoption of the system would
tend toward the undermining of tbe check
which the President, the Senate and the
Supreme Court have on hasty or untimely
legislation in tbe lower house, and that,
furthermore, it would tend to destroy the
principle of federation between the States
and so lessen individual right in making a
stronger central power.
R. Sterling was tbe next speaker for
Princeton. F. O. White of Harvard fol
lowed. R. M. McElroy closed for Prince
ton. Charles Grilk closed for Harvard.
Harvard got the decision.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
TO SHORTEN THE
HOURS OF LABOR
Scope of the Work Before
the Federation of
America.
Headquarters to Be Removed
From Indianapolis to Wash*
ington, D. C.
Some Delegates Opposed the Project,
Fearing Contamination From
Capitai Lobbyists.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 19.â At to
day's session of the Federation of Labor
the committee on president's report
recommended that the action of the
granting of a charter to the American
Federation of Musicians, which now has a
membership of nearly i.OOO, be indorsed,
and the recommendation was unanimously
acquiesced in.
On reorganization it was recommended
that the National Association of Electrical
Workers be granted affiliation and co
operation of the American Federation of
Labor in the work of organization, and
the recommendation was approved.
A recommendation that the executive
council extend aid to the International
Longshoremen's Association in the mat
ter of organization was agreed to.
Consideration of the report of the spe
cial committee on the eight-hour move
ment was taken up, the convention acting
on each recommendation separately and
indorsing each unanimously until the one
favoring the appointment of a committee
of two to go to Washington was reached.
Delegate Lloyd moved to amend that the
convention elect the committee instead of
that it be appointed by the executive coun
cil snd the amendment was carried, after
a long discussion, by a vote of 44 to 43.
Another amendment was offered that,
in order to meet expenses in carrying out
the provisions of the special committee's
report, an assessment of 5 cents ba levied
on erica member of all bodies affiliated
with the American Federation of Labor.
Two substitutes were offered /or this
amendment â one for an assessment of 2
cents, the other for 1 cent â and the mat
ter was discussed until the hour for ad
journment arrived.
An assessment of 5 cents would amount
to more tiian $30,000, and it was stated to
the convention by Delegate Furuseth, who
was at Washington during the last session
of Congress to urge an eight-hour law,
that $1000 would defray all necessary ex
penses there for two months.
Just before adjournment Delegate
Lloyd, in behalf of the delegates in attend
ance at the convention, presented to Fra
ternal Delegate Samuel Wood of Great
Britain a handsome diamond-studded
watch charm, and to Fraternal Delegate
John Manlinson a beautiiul watch.
Each of the gentlemen responded feel
ingly to Mr. Lloyd's presentation ad
dress.
The report of the committee on the
â¢ight-hour movement recommends that a
series of simultaneous mass-meetings be
held by the wageworkers of the entire
country, preferably on public holidays.
The dates suggested are a3 follows: Feb
ruary 22, May 1, July 4, September 6, No
vember 24; further meetings to be deter
mined by the convention of 1897. The is
suance of pamphlets, circulars and other
literature upon the advantage of the
shorter workday: to generally request ail
public speakers, newspapers and the labor
press to make the aims and purposes of
the eight-hour movement the theme of
simultaneous discourse; the issuance of
circulars to the employers generally and
directly, requesting the concession of the
eight-hour workday ; the appointment of
committees by local central bodies and
local trade unions to wait upon employers
with a view of securing the eight-hour
workday without cessation of work.
The report further recommends:
"That the officers of the National and
international and local trade unions fur
nish data as to the progress made in the
matter of organization and preparation
for the inauguration of a general move
ment to reduce the hours ot labor. That
this convention will recommend to all or
ganizations that an effort be made to se
cure a reduction in the hours of labor at
as early a time as possible, and particu
larly during the spring, or May 1, 1897.
We earnestly seek the co-operation of all
fair-minded men and women of our time,
and declare openly and unequivocally our
purpose to demand the enforcement of
the eight-hour workday. May 1, 1898, and
to that end we ?hali bend our every effort.
The eight-hour philosophy deals with
men in the conditions that surround them
and lifts the class of wageworkers out of
wage conditions, and thus inaugurates a
true peaceful method, the new era of man
hood and womanhood emancipated from
economic slavery."
Immediately upon the assembling of
the convention for the afternoon session
the roll was called on the proDosition for
a 5-cent assessment, and resulted in an
almost unanimous negative vote. Roll
call on the proposition lot a 2-cent nssess
ment resulted in G65 ayes and 1510 noes.
The proposition for a 1-cent assessment
was adopted by a ve.ry large majority.
The committee's report as a whole was
adopted.
President Gompers announced that as a
result of the convention of the A. F. of L.,
now in session, there have been formed
an engineers' National union, a bicycle
workers' National union, a butchers' Na
tional union and a coremakers' inter
national union.
The special committee reported on the
Erdman arbitration bill, and after recit
ing several defects recommended that its
provisions be not indorsed.
A motion was im.de that further consid
eration of the report be deferred until
Monday morning, the committee mean
while to get a legal construction of sec
tions 5 and 6, and was carried.
The committee on law recommended
that a resolution enabling an amendment
to the constitution to be made by a ma
jority instead of requiring a two-thirds
vote of the convention be not concurred
in, and the recommendation was con
curred in.
A resolution for the establishment of a
defense fund by the levying of 1-cent
monthly dues was favorably, reported by
the law committee and the recommenda
tion acquiesced in.
Delegate Meyers offered a resolution
that hereafter A. F. of L. officers bd
elected for a term of two years and it was
promptly negatived.
The matter of moving the National
headquarters has been much discussed by
the delegates and was brought before the
convention. President Gompers vacated
tne chair and gave the convention his
views on the subject, which were strongly
in favor of removal from Indianapolis.
His chief arguments were that that city
lacked adequate facilities for the dissemi
nation of federation and labor news
through the public press, the great news
associations having there only correspond
ents who could put nothing on the wires
without nrst receiving orders from head
quarters in some larger cities, and that it
was equally lacking in printing facilities.
He did not speak in favor of any other
city. There were several other speeches
on theÃubject, most of them favoring tbe
motion, and on tbe roll being called to
strike out, was carried by 1670 to 70, and
Indianapolis was ordered stricken from
the constitution. Delegate Silver of
Washington City moved that the word
Washington be substituted, and the mo
tion was seconded by Delegate Marr in a
speech setting forth the advantage* to be
derived from locating at the National
capital.
Delegate Kennehan of Denver moved
that Chicago be substituted. Delegate
Weismann entered a radical protest
against Washington, holding that there
was a great danger that the executive
council and permanent officers of the fed
eration would become contaminated by
the degrading and corrupt practices and
influences that would there surround
them, degenerate into professional Con
gressional lobbyists and lose the influence
which they can now exert with members
of the Nation's Legislature as honest men
asking only that which is right in behalf
of the Nation's wage-earners.
"I hope that Washington will not be
chosen," said he, "but I know it will.
There is a combination in this convention
that has already accomplished the passage
of several measures of doubtful propriety
and it will accomplish this one."
There was a general murmur of disap
proval of this remark, and the chair
promptly called the delegate to order.
First Vice-president P. J. McGuire denied
that there was any probability of the
members of the executive council becom
ing corrupted or stooping to the level of
professional lobbyists, and advocated the
selection of Washington for the poud of
the federation and all wane-earners. He
hoped to see the time when the organiza
tion will buy ground and erect a temple
in the Nation's capital for the permanent
home of the American Federation of
Labor.
After two or three other delegates had
spoken, the discussion was brought to a
close by a motion for the previous question,
and the vote resulted in the selection of
Washington by 1787 against 474 for
Chicago.
Fraternal Delegates Samuel Wood and
John Manlinson having announced that
they would leave at 8 o'clock on their
journey to their homes in England and
Scotland, President Gompers, in a very
happy manner, expressed tne pleaseurefelt
by the convention over tbeir presence,
ana each of the gentlemen responded in
words of highest commendation of tbe
manner in which the business of the con
vention was conducted and the high order
of intelligence and kindness of the dele
gates.
On motion a special committee of five
was appointed io escort the fraternal dele
gates to the railway station, and after
sinjjine "Auld Lang Syne" and "Tnpy
Are Jolly Good Fellows" in chorus, the
convention adjourned until 9 o'clock Mon
day morning.
â¢It is thoui/bt the convention will com
plete its work Monday.
CARE OF ORPHAN GIRLS.
Xoble Work to Be Done by a Greater Aete
York Society.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 19. â The
Greater New York German Orphan
Dowry Society is an organization which
lias been founded by Lazarus Morganthau,
a philanthropist. The object of this so
ciety is to protect German orphan girls
who are unable to secure employment,
and it will also provide a sufficient dowry
to enable them to marry suitable men.
Any German girl, no matter ot what re
ligious creed, will be looked after by this
society. Four girls are to be married on
Washington's birthday. The board of di
rectors will consist of 200 members, one
half Christians, the other Hebrews. For
the present every pirl who marries will
receive a dowry of $100, but Mr. Morgan
thau believes that beiore long the finan
cial condition of the society will wairant
the giving of a much larger sum. For
thirty-eight yenrs Mr. Morganthau has
devoted himself to a study of the subject.
He is now 81 years old.
WILL RENFFIT FARMERS
Cramp Discover* â  Many Valuable Use*
for Cornstalks. t
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 19.â A Times
special from ' Washington says: A select
company of Senators and Representatives
from the corn-growing States of the West
were Thursday night the guests of Mr.
Cramp, the Philadelphia ship- builder,
who introduced them to the secret of va
rious discoveries thai his chemist has been
making for the utilization of the corn
crop.
Mr. Cramp explained that his chemist
had discovered that cornstalks could be
made worth $2 a ton or '$5 an acre by
mechanism which would extract from
them alcohol, cellulose, a material for
mattings, carpets, papers, smokeless pow
der and cattle fooi superior to any other.
These direct benefits to the farmers of the
great corn-growing States of the West
would be over $225,000,000 per annum on
an acreage of lees than 40,000,000.
WAX IS A BIG GUINANTEE
lherefore William Jrnning* Bryan. It
Xot Desired at Albany.
ALBANY, N. V., Dec. 19.â William
Jennings Bryan wants a guarantee of
{3500 to lecture in Albany. Messrs. J. R.
Nangle and John M. Munro, two promi
nent men here, thought it would be an ex
cellent scheme financially to bring Mr.
Bryan to Albany under the auspices of
the G. A. R. of Albany County. A letter
under the date of Novem bur 18 was mailed
to Mr. Bryan's manager, asking lor terms
and other information.
In the reply it was stated: "We will
book Mr. Bryan on the following terms:
That we receive 7.3 per cent of the gross
receipts, with a guarantee that our share
would not be less than $3500."
Messrs. Nangel and Munro have given
up the pioject, as they could not see
where the G. A. R. would come in if Mr.
Bryan's manager wanted such a large
guarantee.
LIKE A MONSTER FISH
Great Speed of the Torpedo- Boat Built
by the Uerreshoff*.
PROVIDENCE, R. 1., Dec. 19. -A new
flier put out from the Herreshoff docks
about noontime yesterday and for an hour
or more darted about the waters of the
lower Narragansett Bay like a monster
tish at play. It was the new torpedo-boat,
No. 6, on her first trip out. The trial was
entirely informal and no attempts were
made to accurately make speed tests â in
fact, it was quite evideut that the propel
ling machinery was not subjected to hiph
pressure. It was merely a "trying out"
experiment for the bnneritof the designers
and builders. The boat returned in an
hour, having gone down the bay as far aa
Gould Island. It is reported that she at
tained aspeed of about twenty-two miles
an hour.

the lawyer sent from Kentucky by the
family of Miss May L. Collins to investi
gate the circumstances of her death by
asphyxiation here last wÂ«ek, writes as fol
lows to the Boston Investigator:
1 am fully pursuaded that Miss Collins'
death was purely accidental and attended
with no circumstances which reflected in any
way upon her character or that of any person
with whomsne had been associated while here.
Her death was a most distressing one and was
made doubly so by the cruelly false and sensa
tional accounts given of it by all ot the news*
papers which I have seen. â¢

Mrs. Alf C. Wheelen, Miss Templeton's
mother, also declared that she had nothing
to corroborate the rumor. So much for
No. 1.
Rumor No. 2 was that Lowell Brown,
who died in this city recently of pneu
monia, had bequeathed several thousand
dollars to Miss Irene Perry, the actress,
whom he was engaged to marry. A. H.
liummel, Mfcs Perry's lawyer, said yester
day there was positively no foundation
for this report. "Mr. Brown's property
was tied up in such a way,' 1 he said,
"that he could not leave it to anybody.
He certainly did not leave a cent to Miss
Perry."
Rumor No. 3 was a little more exciting
than the two that had preceded it. Miss
Lorraine Dreux of Thomas Q. Seabrooke's
company, now playing in Boston, had so
the gossips averred in a moment of de
spair caused by tbe base assertion of a
former friend swallowed poison with sui
cidal intent and had been rescued from
death with difficulty and a stomach
pump. Miss Dreux last night character
ized the whole story as a "malicious lie"
and expressed the opinion that the former
friend in question was responsible lor it.
"Take poison for him or any other man ?
Well, I guess not." She looked as it she
meant it.
The final rumor of the day was that
Mi>s Delia Fox had suddenly crossed the
continent and was occupying a box at the
Olympian Music Hall. The lady in the
pox did look very much like the comic
opera singer â at a distance. It was only
one of her doubles, however. Miss Fox is
in Denver this week.
Four rumors in one day, and not a par
ticle of truth in one of ihem. That's do
ing pretty well, even for the Rialto.
Charles Henry Butler, Professor Herr
mann's attorney, said yesterday 'hat
Mme. Herrmann would receive a compe
tence for life from her husband's estate
after the debts were all paid. "Jut be
fore Professor Herrmann started on bis
last tour," said Mr. Butler, "he called at
my office and adjusted his business af
fairs, so that there will be no complica
tions to embarrass his administratrix,
who will, of course, be Mme. Herrmann."
" The estate consists of the rare and valu
able collection of gems and antiquities at
Professor Herrmann's white stone house,
ihe three private cars â Herrmann, Fra
Diavolo and Addie â a stable of six horses,
the yacht Fra Diavoio and the cash rev
enue of the season, less the expenses,
which are said to have been very large.
Professor Herrmann left no will. So far
as known he left no real estate. He car
ried life insurance in several companies,
the last policy having been issued several
months ago. It is possible, Butler said,
that Professor Hermann's nephew, Leo
Herrmann, may succeed to the mantle of
the magician. Professor Hermann had
been in correspondence with him for the
past six months with that object in
view. It is expected that Leo will come
to America at once to aid Mme. Herrmann
in her future theatrical career. He is said
to have much of his uncle's powers of
legerdemain.

Freeman anil richer Win.
STANFOKD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
19. â The final tennis match in the cham
pionship doubles came off this afternoon
between the winners of the late tourna
ment, Arnold and Kaetzel, and last year's
champions, Freeman '99 and Picker '98. It
was generally supposed that Picher and
Freeman had concluded to let the match
go by default, inasmuch as it was sched
uled to occur some time ago. The result
was that very few students witnessed tha
match, which was generally all one way,
but enlivened throughout by very pretty
rallies. Picher and Freeman won by
scores of 6âo, 6âo, 6â2. The play proved
that they are easily the champions.

have experienced under treatment at the

Since last Christmas I have been quite
an invalid from trouble in my chest, with
cough, difficulty in breathing and general
nerve debility. On Monday, November

tute. I had been , treated by three : well-
known medical men of this city without
any relief. Dr. W. K. Vance; at the State
Electro-Medical Institute, made a careful
examination of my case and pronounced
it one of Bronchial Asthma. Ha placed
me under a course of electrical treatment
with m dicines combined, and I at once i
be .-an to pick up, and am now wonder-
fully improved in health and ! spirits. As
this is the first and only relief thai, I have
obtained from my distressing complaint I
desire to give the State-'Eleciro-Medical
Institute a public testimonial. I will
gladly and willingly reply /to any ques-
tions, either personally or by letter, that
may be addressed.to me here.

POWERS` BILL
Huntington's Handy Help
ers Urge the Refund
ing Scheme.
Adoption of a Rule Setting the
Measure for Hearing in the
House Next Month.
Judgs Maguire Says the Government
Is Protected by the Ihurman Act
and Demands Foreclosure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 19.â The
Pacific roads funding bill showed its head
for the first time at this session when to
day Henderson of lowa, from the Rules
Committee, reported a resolution setting
January 7 as the day to take up the Pow
ers bill, general debate to continue for two
days and one day under the five-minute
rule, the vote to be taken on January 11.
Henderson said:
"I do not ihink it is necessary fo r me to
say very much about the bill. The bill
leferred to in the resolution is what is
Known as the Pucitic funding bill, and the
/ only question before the House in consid
lering the rule now is, i?hall we take this
up and consider it at all? It does
1 not involve in discussing the pending or
der a aiscussion of the merits of the bill,
and when we vote for this rule for the con
sideration of the biii it dees not neces
sarily imply that afterward it will invoive
the voting for the bill in question. The
member reserves for himself the right to
vote as he pleases on the passage of the
bill. I'want to say that we have consulted
(the Committee on Rules) with gentlemen
eniertainins opposite views in respect 10
the legislation proposed here, and we have
endeavored to fix the time so as to be
a^reeabie to the views of both sides, ana
pive such time as is necessary to a full,
candid and fair consideration of the bill.
. ''You will see that nnder the rule we
give Thursday, Friday and Saturday alter
after the disposition of the Loud bill, by
the rue just adopted in the House, for
â¢ discussing the Pacific funding bill and the
amendments that may be offered, and on
Monday, immediately after tne reading of
the journal, the vote on the bill and the
amendments and such substitute as may
be offered is to be takeu."
Dockery â Under the rule as presented
wiil there be an opportunity to present a
â substitute?
Henderson â Certainly; because amend
ments are permitted, and a substitute is
on amendment.
1 D6ckeryâ But the opportunity, under
the ruie, won't present it>eif unless the
last section of the bill is renched.
McMiliin â A sub:titute may be offered
but not voted upon until the time is faxed.
Henderson continued: "Now, a few
words as to the question whether we
should consider the bill or not. The sub
sidy bond* covered by (he bill amount, I
Gaderstand, Â£o over $61,000,000. The
amount of indebtbdness on the Ist of next
January will be, in round numbers, $111,
0 0,000. Th- Government has a second
hen for this amount on 2293.4 miles of
I railroad, with the appurtenant projierty
of the roads. All of the prior liens upon
the property have been unpaid and hence
the amount involved in the question to be
coutfMered is the Government claim, plus
the prior liens, amount in all to over
1172,000,000?
"The President tells us in his message
that on January 1, 1897, there will be aue
on the bonds or the road |19, 000,000 and by
January 1, I^o9, an additional amount of
more than $41,000,000. It is contended, I
do not know with what truth, that if a
foreciosure is had the Government will
realize but very little out of its claim.
That, I trust, is a point on which we will
have ample discussion if the bill is to be
considered. The Committee on Rules
urged upon by all hands and by the differ
ent officers of tbe Government, have un
animously brought in this rule so that the
House' might have an opportunity to
determine whether or not it will take
up thifc question and consider it. If they
decide to consider it then they must deter
mine whether or not it is their intention
to confess to ths country that they have
not the ability to brin^ forward a remedy
by legislation. It may be that when this
is considered no method can be pointed
out that will show how the Government
can sava this vast sum of money. That is
a matter for discussion, but in all events
every Representative should have the
courage to let this matter come up for
frank and full consideration and discus
sion and see whether or not we can save
these mighty millions to the country or
whether we must abandon them to the
chance of foreclosure, knowing a prior
hen is upon every dollar of that which we
have a second lien upon."
Judge Maguirc said :
"Mr. Speaker, I realize that under the
dra-tic rules of tbis House it is useless to
oppose the report oi the Committee ou
Rules giving and fixing the time for the
consideration of this bill. lam too well
aware that under the rules of the House
cioture, which the committee invokes for
the bill, applies to the consideration of
the report, and I know also that a num
ber of gentleme 1 who ara opposed 10 the
bill will not vote against tbe committee
on this question; but, sir, I cannot per
mit the statement just made by tue gen
tleman from lowa (Henderson) to pass
unchallenged. Several of hi 3 statements
are misleading and some of them abso
lutely erroneous. The Government is not
menaced by any such danger as the gen
tieman suggests. It :s not the interest of
the Government but the interests of the
d'btor companies that ara to be promoted
by the Towers bill.
"The Government is amply protected by
the Thurman act, under which foreclosure
proceedings will sUortiy be instituted, un
less Congress as a favor to tho defomJting
companies shall relieve them from their
obligations under that act by extending
the time for payment of the debt. Tuat
the companies should be anxious to
have this bill brought on speedily lor con
sideration is quite natural >ecause their
interests are to bn promoted by it, bat the
interests of the United State Government
are now protected by the best safeguard
tcf which existing conditions will permit â
[tbÂ« ritfht ot foreclosure and such rights as
it may have to pursue diverted assets and
the unpaid subscriptions of stockholders.
"The provisions of the Thurraan act are
far better for the Government than the
proposed refunding act. The Thurman
act was a settlement of the Pacific railroad
question. It preiented the alternative to
the companies to pay or submit to fore
closure. They did not pay, and this ur
gent proposition is to relieve them of the
alternative. That is all. The only defect
so far developed in the Thurman act is
tnat it does not vest jurisdiction in any
particular court (nor in any court in my
opinion) over the interest of the United
States Government in the roads. If any
change in existing law is needed it is that
jurisdiction be vested in tho Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia or some
other particular court to adjudicate and
determine the interest of the Government
in the roads.
"The gentleman from lowa (Hender
son) says the question is how to get the
most money for the Government. That
question should properly be discussed
when the bill is up for consideration on
its merits. It is the question presented
by the bill. That may be the ultimate
question, but the gentleman is mistaken
In statins that the Secretary of the Inte
rior (Smith) suggested refunding as the
best method. He did not. He staled be
fore the House committee and tes
tified before the Sena;e committee
that ia his opinion foreclosure was the
best means of getting the most money for
the Government out of the roads. Messr?.
Anderson and Coombs, Government di
rectors of the Union Pacific Railway Com
pany, who have investigated the matter
fully, in like manner stated and testified
that In their opinion foreclosure is the best
method of procedure for the protection of
the Government. Mr. Coombs, Govern
ment Director of the Union Pacific Rail
road, testified before the Senate Com
mittee and stated be.'ore the House Com
mittee, that $120,000,000 c<Â»n be obtained
by foreclosure sale of these two roads,
which would net the Government about
$60,000,000, which is at least $40,000,000
more than it will ever get if the bill how
pw)posed to be given consideration shall
pass. Mr. Anderson, Government Di
rector of the Union Pacific Railroad and
author of the majority report of the Paci
fic Railway Commission, in which refund
ing was recommended, as stated by the
.gentleman from lowa (Henderson), testi
fied beforo the Senate Committee during
its hearings last spring that he had
changed his mind on that subject and that
in his opinion foreclosure and not refund
ing was the best remedy.
"The President's message to Congress
at the opening of the present session
urged action, or rather declared that it
action be not taken by Congress by tl c
Ist of January next there would seem
then to be no further reason for delaying
foreclosure proceedings.
"It seem 3to me that neither this House
nor the country has anything to fear irom
that alternative. The House and the
country may well permit every reason
which has heretofore influenced the Presi
dent to delay foreclosure proceedings to
be removed by the failure of further Con
gressional action in the interest of these
companies. Let the course of judicial
proceduie ordinarily adopted in such
cases among citizens be followed. For my
part I am not only opposed to the bill,
but opposed to the consideration of it. It
is neither necessary nor useful."
At the conclusion of Judge Maguire's
remarks the rule was adopted without
division. *
COLORADO ATREC FIRST
Denver Cries Out Atjninxt Unjust
J'rrif/ht- Mate Discrimination.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dae 19.â George
C. Kendell of Denver, who is in Washing
ton to attend the hearing before the Inter
state Commerce Commission of a petition
of a number of Western railroads to sus
pend section 4 of the interitaterommerce
ace commonly known as the '"long and
short haul clause," said this afternoon:
"The rate proposed by the railroads will
practically kill the jobbing and ma/iufac
turirig business of Denver. Goods manu
factured in Chicago, for instance, on ac
count, of discrimination of freight charges,
cannot bo jobbed by Denver merchants to
Utah points in competition with Utah and
many other Missouri River points. From
Chicago to Denver first-efss ra'es are
$2 05; irom Denver to Salt Lake $185, a
total ot $o 90. But from Chicago to Omaha
the rate H only 80 cents and from that ciiy
to Salt Like City ?2 30, showing that
Denver suffers a handicap of 80 cents per
hundredweight.
"On transcontinental rates tbe discrimi
nation is severe. The charge on casu reg
isters per hundredweight from Chicago to
Sun Francisco is $2 40, but from Chicago
to Denver $4 10, although the latter is a
1500 mile shorter haul. Thus it is quie
evident why the Denver people resist the
suspension of section 4, wh.ch forbids the
charging of more for the s oner haul
within the longer nnder similar circum
siances and conditions. Our people just
now are in sympathy with llie Cubans,
but think, as charity begins at home, the
cry of "Colorado Libra' is of more impor
tance than that of 'Cuba Libre.'

REFORMS CANNOT
YET BE HASTENED
Powers Interested in Tur
key Await Action
by Russia.
Conference of M. Nelidoff at
Constantinople With the
Other Embassadors.
P ans to Sutdui tbe Sultan Will
Fail Unless Coercion Is
Freely Used.
BERLIN, Germany., Dec. 19.â M. Neli
doff, Russian Embassador to Turkey, who
has just returned to Constantinople from
St. Petersburg, held to-day the first of the
conferences with the other Embassadors
which ho is empowered by his Govern
ment to participate in with a view of de
termining the policy to be pursued by the
powers in the enfoicement of reforms in
Turkey. If the proposals made by the
Russian Government through 11. Nelidoff
partook in any degree of the character of
coercion it is certain the Berlin Govern
ment would be aware of it.
The fact, however, that Baron Saurma
yon Jeltsch, the German Embassador to
Turkey, was absent from the conference,
is sufficient to warrant absolute convic
tion that the deliberations of tbe initial
conference were by no means serious. All
that is known in Berlin in regard to the
matter tends to show the existence of a
very conclusive stage of negotiations, but
the plans discussed will doubtless be
pushed into a more complete and compre
hensive shape at subsequent meetings of
the Embassadors.
M. Nelidoff has a scheme of reform of
Tnrkish finances and a reorganization of
the administration of the internal affairs
of the empire, to which Great Britain and
France fully assent, though the other
powers are less absolutely committed to
it. But Russia has not as yet suggested a
resort to armed coercion to enforce the
scheme. It is a fact that every European
Government is fully aware that diplomatic
pressure upon the Suitan is useless unless
it be accompanied by menaces and physi
cal force, and the powers therefore await
tbe initiative of Russia in the application
of coercive measures.
The latest utterances of the North Ger
man Gazette upon the Turkish situation
proves that Germany adheres to her old
atiitude and contends that the Sultan
must not be threatened and no power
must be permitted to take measures tend
ing toward dismembsrinent of the Turk
ish empire. The financial scheme formu
lated by M. Nelidoff is understood here to
invoive tbe revision of the entire Ottoman
debt under guarantee of European powers
signatory to the agreement.
The plan also contemplates the full con
trol of European powers over the Turkish
revenues, the allotment of a fixed sum for
the maintenance of the army and navy
and for the purposes of the Sultan's pri
vate purse, and further provides that the
Sultan's appointment of his Ministers
shall be subject to approval or veto by the
representatives of th 6 powers in Constan
tinople. Germany has no interest in hast
ening events in the East and the diplo
mats of Derlin are thcreiore reticent as to
the situation; but the opinion is undoubt
edly held in official circles that the confer
ence of Embassadors wijl be fntile unless
their conclusions are backed to the extent
of coercion.
Both the Reichstag and the Prussian
LandtHg have b^gun their Christmas re
cess after sessions which have been con
tpicuo'.i?ly void of useful legislation. In
the Reichstag it has oJten been difficult
and sometimes impossible to obtain a auo
rum and most of the Deputies have shown
the utmost indifference to their executive
duties.
Tho defeat of the Government on Tues
day upon the provision for a reform of
judicial procedure has nullified two years'
work in and out of committee in the con
sideration of the Penal Code. The Gov
ernment ascribes its deieat to the defec
tion of the Centrists, but the minority
vote shows that only a fraction of Conser
vative and Natiqpal Liberals are included.
In commenting upon this analysis of the
vote the Freiseiaige newspapers ask what
has tecome of the majority which the
Government was supposed to have in tbe
Reichstag.
The assertion made by the Berlin Post
that it was the intention of the Govern
ment to resort to measures against the
importation of American petroleum a3 an
act of reprisal for President Cleveland's
message to Congreis of December 3 reim
posing tonn.acre duties apon vessels arriv
ing in America trom German ports by the
revocation of the Pn-.ident's proclama
tion of January 26, 1888, suspending such
duties, appears to be mere guesswork.
Inquiries made by â¢ representative of
the United Associated Presses have
elicited the official opinion fiat no such
restrictions as nilegeJ by the Post are
contemplated by the Government. The
Post, in its article on the subject, says
that although Russia now supplies only
one-eighteenth ot the 900,000.000 kilo
grams of petroleum imported into Ger
many, the Americans are deceived if they
think Germans depend upon the United
States for the petroleum they consume.
This, however, is just where the Post
errÂ«. Germany has too groat need of
American petroleum to debar its impor
tation.

CARNIVAL ON THE ICE
Great I'nparation* for the Skating Con
tratÃ at Montreal.
MONTREAL. Quebec, Dec. 19.â The ex
ecuiive committee having charge of the
international amateur skating competi
tion for the championship of the world in
distance skating, and which opens here
during the first week of February, has de
cided to extend the date up to which en
tries may bo received to January 31 next.
Elaborate arrangements are teinu made
ior the event, and the executive commit
tee is holding tn-weekly meeting*.
Many of the leading skaters of this and
other countries have already entered, and
a breaking of records is looked for. The
two principal events will be the interna
tional amateur races for distances ol 10,000
and 5000 meters respectively. Copies of
the invitation and ruies have been pre
pared in all Continental languages and
forwarded to the skating clubs and socie

HAMBURG, Germany, Dec. 19.â The
Senate to-day replied to the proposition of
the strikers that a court of arbitration be
arranged for a conference of representa
tives of employers and workmen in tbe
presence of tne Senate. Th report throws
cold water on the hopes of th? strikers to
settle the dispute in the mannpr they de
sired. The Senate declares that it is the
duty of the strikers to resume work, add
ing that if they do so it will arrange that
a searching inquiry shall be made into the
trouble with a view to preparing a method
of settling any disputes by arbitration be
tween the employers and employes.

HEARINGS ON THE TARIFF
Wide Scope of the Committee in Fortnin
the.Srto Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 19.â The
Ways and Means Committee of the House
is as far as possible discouraging oral
hearings. Many persons who have writ
ten for information respecting the hear
ings have been asked to put their argu
ments in writing so that they uiay 're
ceive more attention from the committee
than would be the case if the latter bad
no such data before them. There is a
determined effort on the part of the com
mittee to finish the hearings on the date
specifiedâ January 11â in order that no
delay may o'-cur in preparing the tariff
bills.
Dolliver of lowa, who will be chairman
of the fcub-coniniiuee having in charge the
agricultural schedule, left for the West
this evening, but will return in time to be
present at tbe first hearing.
DolliversHVs that ihe agricultural sched
ule, which in effect includes the woolen
schedule, will receive careful attention
from the committee. The farmers along
the Northern border have been complain
ing bitterly for the past two years, he
says, of the competition of Canadians and
it is proposed to give them a protection
that will be quite as satisfactory as that
afforded by the McKiniey bill.
So much interest is felt in the Northwest
over the new tariff bill that Representative
Tawney of Minnesota, who is a member of
the Ways and Means Committee, has been
asked to see county delegates interested
in the different schedules of the bill during
hi*) visit homo. In order to accommodate
these gentlemen he wiil spend one or two
days in Minneapolis and St. Paul during
his absence from Washington. Minne
sota is interested in a numbÂ«r of sched
ules, 'particularly agriculture, iron ore and
lumber, and it is in reference to these
that his attention wiil be specifically di
rected.
An Vrgent Deficiency Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 19.â The
Appropriations Committee to-dayreported
to the House an urgent deficiency bill.
The measure provided for meeting the
urgent demands of the Government is
divided as follows: Contingent expenses
independent of treasury, $102,004; Navy
Department, $700,000; Department of Jus
tice, $51,270; electoral messenger", $600;
H<<usÂ» of Representatives, $23 538; total,
$?51,862. The Navy Departm nt, in re
questing the appropriation, states that its
available appropriation for repairs, etc.,
is almost exhausted.
USE OF PIG-IRON WARRANTS.
An Innovation in the Trade That Will Be
of Great Service to Dealers
and Consumers.
NEW YORK, N. V., D?cr 19. -The state
ment that after the first of the year there
will be daily calls on pig-iron warrants of
the American Pig-iron Storage Warrant
Company on tho metai was the cause of
much discussion in metai circles to-day.
It was viewed as indicating that tbe ex
change had taken official action in a form
of business in which members hays indi
vidually engaged heretofore. It was
looked upon as meaning a big cut in the
business of dealers of iron. As the reason
ot this innovation it is likely there will be
considerable speculative interest in the
iron in the future. The warrants have
already been entered among the unlisted
securities on the New York Stock Ex
chanae, the Consoiidated Exchange and
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
The com puny makes a contract with
furnace companies for a period of yeats,
the obligations entered into by the furnace
being that it will not place any iron
against which warrants are to be issued
into the hands of any other warrant com
pany. The producer is at liberty td store
arty part or none of his product in
the yards. For what he does store in it
he has a yardage of 25 cents a ton and 2
cents per month carrying charges. In
consideration of these payments the stor
age companies act as the proper custodian
of the iron. To the consumer it guaran
tees the grading which is checked by ex
ports. The warrants call for 100 tons of
pi<; iron of a specified brand and grade de
livered free on board cars in the yard
named in the warrant. The charges are
relatively low, the cost of carrying pigiron
a year being 4!) cents.
President George W. Hull of the ex
change said that the new system was
generally in the trade a necessary adjunct
in the business. Steamers and sailor 3
who desired to make prices on large lots
of manufactured iron and steel for long
future iteiivery would not now be obliged
to take a large risk of the market. As it
is they could always protect themselves
on these bi.ls by the purchasing of war
wants. Furnace companies having their
yards and a large stock of raw material if
they anticipated a decline in the mark t
can telegraph to New York and sell 10,000
to 20,000 tons by warrants within a iew
minutes without aff cting the price more
than one or two cents, whereas if they at
tempted to sell a like amount of iron to
consumers they might, be a week in doing
it, and depress the consumers' market
considerably.

BECAUSE HE LOVED HER
Harry TrlrzeW* \txcute for Shooting
. -Mr.t. Caldon lounp. n
PLYMOUTH. iN. H., Dec. 19.â Mrs.
Edith Caldon Young, who was shot in
both ears Wednesday by Harry Frizzell,
regained 'consciousness, yesterday and
made a sworn statement before a Justice.
Frizzoll shot Mrs. Young and then at
tempted to kill himself.
; A few hours after; the shooting he re
gained consciousness and 'said that the
shooting ? was .' done : at > Mrs. Young's sug
gestion; that he loved her and that neither
of them had a desire to live.
The story as told by Mrs. Young yester
day was entirely different and contradicts
Pnzzeli in ail ; pariiculars. She says she
despised ; Frizzell and v had desired him to
leave her boarding-house; that she had
no idea of killing herseli, nor did she plan
to have Frizzell shoot her. She did not
know he was in the house until when f ha
was sitting in the sitting-room she heard
the door open and * Frizzell entered, 1 and
with an ' octh threw : his \ arm 'about her
neck from behind and shot her in the ear.

IN THE REALM
OF JOHN BULL
Comment as to the Confer
ence of the Six Great
Powers on Turkey.
General Norman to Inquire Into
the West Indies Sugar
Industry.
Quean Victoria May Not Go to Dublin
and Belfast Before the "Great
Reign Jubilee."
LONDON, Eno., Dec. 19.â There has
been no lessening of interest in political
circles regarding the Turkish question,
and so far as known there has been no
change in the situation since tne return to
Constantinople from St. Petersburg of M.
Nelidoff, tbe Russian Embassador. The
only authentic news that, has reached
the Foreign Office here is that immedi
ately after his arrival in Constantinople,
Nelidoff called on Cambon, the French
Embassador, and Sir Philip Currie, the
British Embassador. He afterward was
given a formal reception by the Sultan.
The subject of their conversation has
not transpired, but it is known that the
Anglo-Russian proposals were not men
tioned to his Majest}-. These will not be
laid Defore the Sultan until after a confer
ence between the Embassadors of the six
great powers â Great Britain, Russia,
France, Germany, Austria and Italy.
In the meantime ail the Embassadora
are opposed to a policy of force. The
negotiations between the powers as to tbe
method of enforcing their demands upon
the Sultan are stiil pending, and it is
scarcely possible that any practical solu
tion will be arrived at until after the
Christmas holidays-
The Colonial Office has appointed Gen
eral Sir Henry Wylie Norman, Sir David
Barbour and Sir Edward Gray, M.P., as a
commission to inquire into the critical
condition of tho sugar industry in tbe
British West Indies.
General Norman was Governor of Ja
in aica from 1883 to 1883, and has a wida
knowiedKS of the conditions governing
the trade of the West Indies. Sir David
Barbour has served in different capacities
under the East Indian Government. Sir
Edward Gray, who is a Liberal, was Par
liamentary Secretary of the Foreign Office
from 1892 to 1895.
The Uritish West Indian sugar planters
claim that the industry has been nearly
ruined by the bounty system of Conti
nental countries, which allows beet-root
sugar to be put down in Great Britain at a
price which defies the competition of Brit
ish growers. They favor the placing of
countervailing duties on Continental sugar
or the calling of art international confer
ence to arrange for abolishing the boun
ties on beet-root sugar.
Tho report that the Quenn will go to
Dublin and Belfast in May, prior to tbe
London celebrations, is, at least, prema
ture. Tbe programme of tbe "Great
Reign Jubilee" is not to be settled till
early in the spring. It is said in court
circles that the Queen desires to repeat
her first tcur in Ireiand, going thence to
the Clyde and Glasgow. The question isj
would the emotions so aroused by revival
of memories, apart Jrom possible physical
fatigue, not be too much ior her?

STUTTGART, Germany, Dec. 19.â Tho

FLAMES RAGE IN
A PENITENTIARY
Convicts Locked in Their
Cells Made Mad by
Fright.
O;hers Assist in Fightfng the
Fire With a Hope of Gain
ing a Pardon.
One of the Prisoners Supposed to Have
Dropped a Lighted Match
in Shavings.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Dec. 19.â At
about 11:45 to-night a fire was discovered
in the State clothing department of the
State Penitentiary.
It is not known how the fire originated,
but it is supposed that one of the convicts
started it by placing some shavings
under one of the boxes, and as he was
marching out for supper he dropped a
lighted match.
At 1 o clock this (Sunday) morning the
fire was still making headway. Fifteen
trusty convicts have been released from
their cells ior the purpose of aiding the
city Fire Department, and all of them are
working hard in the hope of being re
warded for their services by a pardon or a
reduction of their sentences.
In transferring the convicts from the
burning building into No. 1 two of the
convicts were missed. They cannot easily
escape, liowever, unless they should hap
pen to get citizens' clothes, which is not
very likely.
Nobody but persons connected with the
prison and members of the press are per
mitted to enter the building gates.
The convicts that are in the cells are yell
ing and acting like madmen.
The Star Clothing Company, which is
located in the same building, next door
to tbe State clothing department, is also
on fire, but the flames in both the State
department and Star Clothing Company
will soon be under control. The loss will
not be large.
The penitentiary is situated about three
miles from the city and contains about
2300 prisoners. L. L. Pace is the warden.
At 1:50 o'clock the firemen succeeded in
getting the fire under control and no more
danger is anticipated. The prison officials
have succeeded in quieting the prisoners
and order again prevails.
ST. PAUL'S DESTRUCTIVE FIRE.
Many Business Houses Reduced to Ruins
end the Loss Will Foot Up Half a
Million Dollars.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Dec. 19.â A review of
the scene of this morning's fire discloses a
situation far more serious financially than
at first estimated. The Schutte block is
totally in ruins. Its original cost was
$110,000. The Northern Exchange Bank
located in the same building, and every
thing outside the vaults was destroyed.
It will be impossible to open the vaults
for forty-eight hours. The Ryan annex,
on the Seventh-street side, is also totally
wrecked. It had no connection with the
Ryan Hotel, a large court intervening,
which saved the hotel. The loss on the
annex will reacb $80,000, of which about
two-thirds is covered by insurance. The
loss to "The Fair," a new notion and toy
store, is $10,000. Insurance, $5000. Car
dozÂ» <fc Co.. furniture-dealers, loss $6000,
no insurance; Twin City Cycling Club,
no insurance; clothing stock held by as
signe of a Chicago firm valued at $4000,
not known whether insured, stock a total
loss by water and smoke.
A large number of tenants, chiefly pro
fessional men, lost their office belongings,
instruments, etc., all of which were unin
sured, adding at least $15,000 to the loss.
A valuable collection of Minnesota his
torical archaeology specimens owned by J.
G. Brewer, and gathered during the past
thirty years and valued at $10,000, was
totally destroyed. No insurance. This
collection was ultimately intended for the
State University and cannot be replaced.
The total loss approximates $500,000.
Furniture Warehouse Burned.
ELIZABETHPORT, N. J., Dec. 19.â The
furniture warehouse owned by McManua
Bros, was burned this afternoon, together
with other buildings on the block. Total
loss amounted to $200,000, insurance par*
tial.
Fire Itentroyed a Block.
DULUTH, Mxnr., Dec. 19.â Fire of un
known origin destroyed the Davis block
last night. The loss was $50,000 and par
tially insured.
SPAIN IS WRATHFUL
f Continued from First Page. ]
mittee, nobody need be alarmed, as there
will be no war unless Spain chooses to de
clare one. It is very humiliating from the
point of view of patriotic America, the
paper adds, that the American market
should go to smash at the extremely re
mote prospect of war with "a power com
monly described by courtesy as 'second
class.'"
A
Colonel Barrimnn liaises a Regiment of
Volunteer* in Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 19â Five
hundred men have enlisted in this city for
the Cuban service in Colonel Harriman's
regiment, and between 300 and 400 letters
have been received from points in Ne
braska, Kansas and Oklahoma asking for
information concerning the proposed reg
imen i's departure to the scene of activity.
The most of the writers ask that their
names be placed upon the enlistment, and
that when it is definitely decided that the
regiment is to leave they be notified, and
they will be on band. The colonel has
sent a letter to the Cuban Junta in New
York asking that the Kansas City regi
ment be called the First Regiment, Cuban
Volunteers.
STOPPED BY AN OFFICIAL.

ST. LOUIS, Mb, Dec. 19.â The United

here. As a result of tbia pointed interpre

Chairman Sturgeon of the relief com
mittee admits that the District Attorney's
strict interpretation of the law has re
tarded relief work, but insistn that work
will continue, though in a less pronounced
manner. He says: 'I cannot conceive
how anybody can construe a meeting held

EX-GOVERNOR HITTE ENLISIS
Will Lead a Renimeut to Fight for
f tibn's Freedom.
DENVER, Colo., Dec. 19.â Ex-Governor
W T aite has enlisted in the Cuban war and
will lead to the eulf coast a well-equipped
regiment, to be known as the Colorado
volunteers.
The regiment will consist of the cream
and youth of the Slate, who are eager to
win laurels in these piping times of peace
at any co>t. They go as the friends of
liberty and will scorn to accept any
pecuniary consideration for their services,
but hope by their prowess in the held to
earn distinction and honor.
An enthusiastic meeting was held here
to-night under a call issued by Colonel
McAndrews, the organizer, and to the
surprise of everybody ex-Governor W'aite
appeared as the chief orator of the occa
sion. He declared himself heartily in
sympathy with the cause and said he
would see the project through to a bloody
finish if it was necessary.
The volunteers will start for Cuba next
Monday week, hiking an overland route
so that they will reach the gulf at a
minimum of cost and save their railroad
fares for the glorious cause of liberty.
Each man is equipped with a Winchester
and a revolver, and the army will sustain
itself on the march by holding meetings
and trusting to the patriotism of the
people en route.
PSLDA REPLIES TO CANOTAS
Says the Cubans fighting for Freedom
Are n tine Itody oj Mm.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 19.â Deiecate
T. Estrada Palma of the Cuban Junta,
after reading an interview with Prime
Minister Canovas of Spain, which the New
York Journal published to-day, and in
which Canovas declared that the indepen
dence of Cuba would mean a republic
dominated by negroes, said:
"Canovas may say what he pleases, but
the Cubans have taken up arms with the
definite idea of freedom and for tb pur
pose of throwing off tho Spanish yoke.
When they did so they did it with the sole
idea of making no arrangement with
Spain, and except in case that Cuba would
be granted its freedom there will be no
compromise.
"The statement of the Spanish Prime
Minister that the revolutionists are ne
groes is ridiculous in the extreme. He
knows absolutely that the prisons in Cuba
and iv the penal colony are full of Cubans
of the highest classes of society on the
island. They consist of doctors, lawyers
and military men who would more than
grace any social class in the world. Fur
ther discussion of Sonor Canovas' state
ment is unnecessary.

Citizens of Xine.oln Speak Boldly in
Thrir Behalf.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Dsc. 19.â The Cuban
mass-meeting to-night resolved itself into
a preliminary gathering to arrange for a
second meeting next Tuesday night. The
attendance was not large, but the bold
stand taken by the speakers in behalf of
the insurgents indicated the sentiment of
those present. Ex-Mayor H. W T . Hardy
presided. A committee, comprising the
leading ex-military men of the city, was
appointed lo draft resolutions and a
memorial to Congress; also to request the
Nebraska representative in Congress that
by ttieir influence and votes they support
all measures in behalf of Cuba. These
resolutions and memorials will be re
ported at the Tuesday night meeting
Governor Holcombe was requested to be
present and is expected to preside. An
urgent invitation to appear and speak was
sent to Mr. Bryan, but it is thought he
will be out of the city.

FA THER DENT'S CELEB R A TED CASE.
Compromises His Damage Suit Against
Friars of St. Francis and Charge of Per
jury Against Him /s Dropped.
BROOKLYN, N. V.. Dec. 19â A gensa
tional conclusion was arrived at in the suit
of Father Dent against the Friars Minor
Order of St. Francis before Justice Os
born in the Supreme Court, special term,
to-day. Father Dent sued the order for
$50,000 and out of that suit developed a
charge of perjury against the priest upon
which charge he was indicted.
Yesterday; at the request of Father
Dent's attornoy, the District Attorney
moved to dismiss that indictment, and
Father Dent consented to the withdrawal
of his suit upon the payment of $10,000
by the order.
Tnis money was paid to the priest to
day. The damage suit was instituted
three years a&o and the trial begun in the
Bupreme Court of this county. Colonel
George Bliss represented the order and
Father Dent appeared as his own lawyer.
On the sixth day of the trial Father Dent
presented a rescript from Rome.
Mr. Bliss declared in an affidavit that
he was taken by surprise, and he asked
for the withdrawal of a jnror. The motion
was granted, bnt Â»<e had to pay Father
Dent the sum of $250. The trial was then
suspended to enable Mr. Bliss to eet tes
ttmony from Rome to meet Father Dent's
rescript.
Two ecclesiastical dignitaries came from
Rome to prove that Father Dent's rescript
was a forjrery. They appeared before the
Kings County Grand Jury, and an indict
ment charging Father Dent witu perjury
waa found on October 31, 1883.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
HEDGES OFFICER
KILLS A MEXICAN
Desperado Resists Arrest
and Is Shot to
Death.
Constable Smarr Uses His Pistol
to Keep Peace in the
Camp.
Fifth Violent Death Within Twu
Months at the Southern
"Diggings."
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 19.â Hedges'
"boneyard," as the denizens of the little
mmm â  camp term it, is growing. Within
the past two months five violent deaths
have added live mounds of earth to the
primitive cemetery. The last Killing oc
curred yesterday, when GregorioGonzales,
a desperado, met death at the hands of
Constable Bmarr.
Hedges is the center of operations of the
Golden Cross Mining Company. The rich
ledges and the remoteness of the camp
attract all kinds of desperadoes and es
pecially those who infest the border and
take advantage of the boundary line to
escape into one country for crimes com
mitted in the other. Of this class was
Gonzules, who will trouble the miners no
more.
Gonzales, who is said to have been a
murderer and was driven out of the State
of Sonoraby the authorities, was employed
by Receiver W. W. Stewart in the Golden
Cross mines. He lived with a Mexican
girl, Pancha Trigueno, whose good looks
attracted the miners and caused more
than one fight for her smiles. Another
Mexican, Timoteo Carnlio, was in love
with the senorita, and the two men quar
reled. Carrillo lay in wait for Gonzalea
one night two weeks ago and nearly suc
ceeded in killing him. Gonzales swore he
would kill Carrillo on sight, and it was
tne meeting of these two that led to the
killing of Gonzales by tbe peace officer.
Constable Sinarr learned oi the trouble,
warned Gonzales to keep the peace and
notified him that he would enforce the
law. Gonzales paid no attention to the
warning and in a saloon at Hedges bran
dished a revolver and declare*! his inten
tion of starting out after Carrillo and kill
ing him wherever found. Constable
Smarr tried to arrest Gonzales and the
latter resisted. A flourish of revolvers
followed. The American was too quicK
for Gonzales. A Coroner's jury to-day
rendered a verdict exonerating Smarr on
tue ground of self-defense.
SLANKARD IS AFTER DUNHAM.
The Fearless Arizona Sheriff Goes From
Phoenix in Quest of the
Murderer.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 19.â There are
plenty of signs which show that Marshal
Gard has not niven up the search for Mur
derer Dunham in San Die^o County or be
low the line. He is now working, it is
said, to secure the proper papers entitling
him to enter Mexican territory, and in the
meantime has several other strings out,
all pointing to a plan to locate and cap
ture Dunham at his supposed hiding
place near the Mexican line.
A search is about to be made for Dun
ham by Deputy Sheriff Charles Slankard
of Maricopa County," Arizona. Slankard
is an old friend of Marshal Gard and has
worked with him in many au important
Government case when Gard was United
States Marshal. Slankard is as fearless as
they are made in Arizona, where fearless
men are the rule. He is a tall, lean, desert
browned fellow, with keen eyes and a
record for daring that is no: stained, like
many others, by stories of dishonor or
fraud.
Just before Marshal Gard appeared in
San Diego on his way to hunt for Dunham
Deputy Sheriff Slankard in Phoenix began
to display a sudden longing to discover the
Pegleg mine, said to nave existed on the
desert in San Diego County. Siankard is
a practical man, but he declared that he
had received a clew to the mine that would
lead him to it and make him a millionaire.
His acute attack of 10-t-mine fever sur
prised all his friends, but as he is inte
rested more or less in mining they attrib
uted it to a prospector's alluring tale and
advised Slankard to have nothing to do
with it. The Deputy Sheriff moisted that
there was something in it ana intide prep
arations to leave Pliocnix with a pack out
fit in search of the Pegieg.
The most significant thing in connec
tion with Slankard's trip was his remark
to seveial friends that his tip led him to
ward the Mexican line in San Diego Coun
ty, and not toward the Riverside County
line, where the Pegleg la supposed, ac
cording to tradition, to hide its gleaming
veins, blankard declared that the mine
lay right on the boundary line, or just be
low it, and he said he could find it without
any trouble at all. Ii he had come straielit
across in the direction he indicated he
would have encountered Marshal Gard
and his party. This circumstance points
to Murderer Dunham as thÂ«Â» Pegleg that
Slankard is after. He is wasting less time
hunting mythical gold mines than his
PhoGnix friends believe.
Sheriff Lyndon, when he was here,
dropped theremark that one of his clews
pointing toward Dunham's presence in
this section was from a prospector who
had come down the Colorado River. He
knew Dunham, and notified the Sheriff
that Dunham had come down the river
part way with him, and then struck west
along the Mexican line. This trail, with
out doubt, is the one now being followed
by Deputy Sheriff Siaukam. It is not
known tere just when Slankard started,
but he was expected at Yuma on Thurs
day. Slankard knows every foot of the
desert, havin : been formerly a guide be
tween San Diego and Yuma. He carried
mail for several years across the areary
waste and also drove a stage.
If Dunham has cho-en the desert fora
hiding-place, SlanJtard is as Â«ood a man
as Gard could engage to find the fugitive
and gather him in.
DEATH OF CAPTAIN LEMON.
The Publisher of the National Tribune
Succumbs to Illness ' at Coro
nado,
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec. 19.â The mem
bers of the G. A. R. in this city are taking
active steps in doing honor to the late
Captain George E. Lemon of Washington,
D. C, who died at Coronado last evening.
To-night four old comradesâ D. L. Kret
sineer, J. V. Hicks, Captain R. H. Shei
donandCaptain T. B. Uartzellâ are de-
tailed to sit ud with the body, and otbe?
members of the two posts here are prepar
ing to start tne body on its long journey
to Washington for interment The mem
bers of HeintzÂ»lnian Post No. 133 have
been ordered to meet at headquarters to
morrow morning at 7:30 o'clock, to march
in a body to th-e Santa Fe depot, whither
it will be conveyed direct from Coronado.
At the depot the old soldiers will pay their
respects to the departed veteran. The
body will be taken to Los Angeles, where
a special car iÂ« awaitine it. Thence it
will be sent over the Sunset Route to
Washington, in care of Captain Lemon's
private secretary and a member of the
family.
Captain Lemon came to San Diego sev
eral weeks ago for the benefit of his
health, which bad become impaired
through too close attention to business as
publisher of the National Trihune and at
tending to pension matters. He came in a
private cur, accompanied by his family
and secretary. They found very pleasant
quarters at Coronado, where Captain
Lemon rallied lor a few days, but his
disease had secured too strong a hold and
after a gallant strneeie he succumbed.
The family received scores of telegrams
of condolence to-day from old veterans in
all parts of the Union. Captain Lemon
became widely known through his pen
sion ousiness and as publisher of the
soldiers' paper at the National capital, and
this, added to his brilliant record in the
war, made many friends for him in all
parts of the country. He was 53 years of
age, having come out of the war ai a cap
tain at Â£6 years of age.
WITHOUT WATER ON THE DESERT
Lower California Tax Collector and His
Guards Almost Overcome by
Thirst.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 19.â A little
party reached Tia Juana yesterday after
an experience on the desert that its mun
bers will never forget. Davia Gold bantu,
Collector of Taxes for the Lower Califor
nia Government, and three ruraies com
posed the party.
Goldbaum has just returned from Yuma
and has a lot of silver money, which is
carried on a mule. It is the proceeds of"
two months' collection among the ranch
ers, miners and cowmen of the peninsula
bordering the desert. The three ruraies
are his guard to prevent robbery by stray
cuttle-thieves or smugglers who infest the
desert below the line.
After reaching Yuma and taxing the
Alogdones ranchers, Goldbaum struck
back across the desert toward La Bajada,
the pass south of the Cocopah Mountains,
and marking the western edge of the
desert stretching between the Cocopah and
Painted Mountains.
The distance across is eighty miles,
broken by a small waterloss rnnee of
mountains, with stretches of sand on
either side. The supply of water ran I
short before reaching a water-hole they \
were making for. but they hurried for
ward, suffering somewhat, and reached
the oasis.
There they found no water, the heat of
the intervening weeks having dried it up.
They were in an appalling position and
had'nothing to do but strike out west- |
ward, sixcy miles across the burning j
sand.
One of the ruraiesâ Sotomayorâ rode a
swift horse, and he volunteered to go
ahead as fast as possible and find water,
returning with it if he found it. Ho
struck out, while tho others followed
slowly with their mules.
They suffered intensely and onne or I
twice were on the point of hiding their
treasure at the foot of a tree or other land
mark and hurrying on without it.
Fortunately Sotomayor, scouring the
desert as he rode, saw a dust c'^oud a long >
distance to the north and making for it |
discovered a party of prospectors, who
gave him a couple of gallonsof water.
He took some and gave a little to his i
horse, and then hurried back. He found
Goldbaum in what was believed to be a !
dying condition, and the two ruraies not
much better.
All quickly revived, however, when
they were given water. The party j
then managed to get across the Los j
Picachos, where they rested for three days
before starting out for Tia Juana.

Indians of the Carlisle ' School Beat the
' " Wisconsin* at Foathnll. ' 'â¢ .
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 19.â The first
great game of football between a Western
college and an eleven of full-blooded

quished by the wiry red men by a score of |
18 to 8. The players were brought h*re
by. the Press Club of Chicago to raise
funds, and 7000 people witness-ed the novel
and exciting contest, which lasted nearly
three hours. i% â¢ .
The .< sympathies of the crowd were
largely with the Indians. The Indians'
tackling, running, punting, interference,
and general mass play; was far superior to
that of their opponents. Metoxen at full
back; Captain Bemu* Pierce, right guard;
Jimson and McFarland were the brilliant
plnyera for Carlisle. :
The Wisconsins' - heavy, work and run
ning was done chiefly by Sheldon, Peal,
Karel and Richards. . Peal was laid out j
with a badly injured leg in the pecoml |
half and his place was taken byO'D^a, |
who was to have played fullback, but bad
a bad arm. -: !' ->O>,
Metoxen scored two touchdowns, Jim
son one and Captain Pierce kicked all the
goals for them. The Wiscoisins' scores
wÂ«re made by Sheldon and Pyre. Captain
Richards failing to kick either goal from
their touchdowns. Gould of Amlierat was
referee and there was much dis-atiafaction
over his work in the lirst half. Delays
were frequent.
FRESNO BICYCLE RACES.
Successful Meeting itpens the Wheelmen's
Three- Lap 'track-.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 19 âThe new three
lap bicycle track, called the Tachydrome,
just north of the city, was opened this
afternoon with a highly successful race
meeting. The attendance was fairly large.
The time was very slow, owing partially
to the sticky condition of the tracfe in
some places. Several professionals from
San I< ran Cisco, among them the beat
riders on tlie coast, took part.
The one mile scratch for professionals
was won by C. S. Wells in 2:20 1-5.
D. E. Whitman was second. The ama
teur one-mile scratch was won by Bert
Starkweather in 3:38 1-5, with E. 0. Harri,
second. H. Sater of Pticenix won the
two- rn Ue handicap for professionals in
6:03 3-5 and F. M. Byrne was second.
In the two-mile handicap of the ama
teurs Perry Simpson was the victor and
E. O. Harris was second. Time, 5:55 3-5.
Tho riders made no efforts for time, bui
contented themselves with some exciting
finishes.
Hanley%Dejeat* Giimore.
TORONTO Ont., Dec. 19.â Nearly 2000
people were at the Princess Theater to
night to witness the twenty round contest
between tbe ex-champion lightweight,
Harry Giimore of Chicago, and Jack
Hanley of Philadelphia. Hanley was too
strong and too quir.k for Giimore and in
the fourth round started In to finish the
fighi. He poured in lefts on Gilmore's
face and the Chicago man was all but out
when the Dell rang. When the men got
up again the referee stopped the tight and
gave the decision to Hanley.
ffnn by l.os Aiigele*.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec 19.â The Los
Angeles Athletic Club football team this

CALLERS UPON McKINLEY
Political Cares lemporarily Laid Aside
by th* President- Elect.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 19.â Major Me
Kinley returned from 1m visit to Evans
ton this morning and spent most of tbe

tain MacWilhams. He arrived about
10:30 o'clock and bad soon numerous
callers. Marshall Field, Archbishop Ire
land and General Wesley Merritt, U. S. A.,
with his staff, were the chief callers, none

formal affair. Mrs. McKinley remained
at the Mac Williams home.

Major McKinley's friends Here is that llli

Two Carloads Now Being

Ranch.
Large Pack of Thoroughbred
Hounds Accompanies ths

Yep .
â¢ REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Dec. 19.â Much
wonderment has teen created of late
among the people of Redwood City and
vicinity by the unusual and extraordinary
sight of a large pack of full-blooded fox
hound?, accompanied by two horsemen,
passing to and iro through this City and
neighborhood. Inquiries as to whence
they came and whither they went de
veloped that the pack, composed of some
fifty or more houtn'.s, belongs to Waller b.
HobÂ«rt of San Mateo, the young million
aire horse-owner, who imported them
direct from England. Tiie two men ac-
companying them in their ramDlings are
trainers who are putting them into con
dition to chase the wily fox.
In securing this pack, Mr. Hobart, who
is a true sportsman, has taken another
means of gratifying a whim and securing
pleasure for himself and his friends. To
have everything in keeping, he has also
imported two carloads of foxes from
England, so that in a short time the
denizens in and about San Mateo will
imagine, by the blast of horns, the baying
of hcunds and the scurrying to and fro of
men and women, mourned on fleet-footed
steeds, that they are indeed back in old
England. Mr. Hobart never does any
thing by halves so long as money will
secure his ends. He is perfectly equipped
for enjoying the sport of fox hunting to its
full extent, being the ownor of some of the
best hurdle-jumping horses in the conntiy,
just the tlnn^ for a cross-country run
wnere the fences are gateless.
It is safe to say that as soon as the
hounds get in condition, the hills on the
Hobart estate, back of San Mateo, will
witness many a fox run to earth, whose
brush .will afterward adorn the apart
ment of the one fortunate enough to be
in at the death.
How the San Mateo farmers will regard
the innovation is a mooted question. The
foxes that e?cape the hounds are quite
likely to nirke it interesting for the
grangers' fowls.
PORTLAND'S SENSATION.
Wife of an Elderly Capitalist E/cpes
. With Her Husband's Good-
Looking N:p L ew.
TORTLAND, Or., Dec. 19. -Philip J.
Young, an eliiejly and wealthy philan
thropist of Albina, a suburb cf this city,
is '.he disconsolate victim of a handsome
but faithless wire and a treacherous j
nephew, Claude Barker by name.
Barker, who is 23 years ola, came to
Portland from Hancock County by invita- I
tion of his uncle" three months ago, and ;
Mr. Youpg intended to start him la ,
business. On Sunday last, Claude, his |
aunt, and the latter's child, went to As
toria on a visit, Mrs. Young taking a
la r ge sum of money with her. They
never came back.
This morning Mr. Young received a let
ter Ironi his wife that nearly broke bis
l.cart.- It was written from San Francisco,
and stated tliat she, Claude and her little I
child were there. Instend of returning j
.from Astoria t 1 ey had taken passage on a j
s;e:iraer and pone to California.
Mr?. Your.c made a complete confession
of the love she and Claude bore to each
other, and said they had concluded that
it was impossible for" them to live apart. !
She begged for forgiveness and asked her
husband not to attempt to separate them, j
for it would be of no avail. They had
had sufficient funds to keep them fora
few weeks, and by that time Claude
hoped to obtain employment of some
kind. She also intimated that their stay
in San Francisco would be erf short dura
tion, but said nothing ot their intentions
as to the tuture.
The duped old gentleman left for San
Francisco to-nijÂ»ht, and will spend any
sum of money to locste the couple. He
is resolved to send Claude to the peni
tentiary if be can succeed in doing so.
STASISON INGIGATION EOW
"Anils" Sleet nt Mtdrttlo to Petition the
. y Jjfgialaturr. â¢
' MODESTO, Cal., Dec.l 9 .âA meeting
to discuss the irrigation difficulties was
held here to-day. Ths meeting was an-
nounced as an anti-irrigation gathering
for the purpose of adopting resolutions
outlining proposed legislation, but many
favoring irrigation were in attendance at
the opera-house, apparently as specta
tors. .
A. F. Underwood was chosen as chair
man and Robert Miller secretary. After
some speech-making, principally by the
attorneys for the anti-irrigators, resolu
tions were presented asking the coming
Legislature to allow the Turlock and
Modesto districts to surrender com
pleted works owned by the districts to a
corporation, company or individuals upon
the return to the p?op:e of all bo.ids sold
by the districts. This virtually means a
surrender of what has been accomplished
since the formation of the di-.tr.cts in 1887.
This called forth a hot discu-sion between
the "antis" and the friends of the irriga
tion law. The resolution waÃ adopted.
Another reso ution was j.res-nted and
adopted asking niÂ«* Legislature to refund
the bonds, makim them iorjy or tilty
year instead of twenty year bonus.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal. , Dec.
Vl9V 19â The engineering students here are
gratified over the success of their efforts
to establish an engineering journal. Con
tributions to the first number are now be-_
ing received by those in charge, and it is
probable that' the journal will make its
appearance in the ; early; part .of,, next
semester. It is the intention of the di
rectors to devote the new periodical ex
clusively to engineering subjects, ana
especially those of importance and -inter
est to Stanford engineering students. â¢- It
Is also believed that the journal wi 1 offer
encouragement to original researcu and
study along engineering lines by jriying
such work publicity and permanency.' .;..
The successful establishment of such a
journal is chiefly due. 10 the efforts of the

arrest Shepher I, who was supposed to be
with his brotiier near Lodi. As the pro
visions of section 1549 of the Penal Code
are very explicit and recite that the na
ture of the crime, where it was com*m it
ted and a description of the man must be
civen, Sheriff Cunningham, on the ad
vice of District Attorney Nutler, tele
graphed for the required information.
This was received this forenoon and the
proper warrant issued. Deputy Sheriffs
Black and Wall were entrusted with the
task of arresting Shepherd. On their way
to Lodi they met Constable Coleman of
that place and Justice of the Peace Wal
lace, who informed them that Shepherd
had driven them away at the point of a
pistol and then committed snicide.
It seems that the Illinois Steriff had
notified Coleman by telegraph to arrest
Shepherd, ami the Constable, disregard
ing the formalities of law, had started to
do as requested. Uefound the man wanted
for embezzlement working in the fields of
his brother, Alexander Shepherd, six
miles from Lodi. When told that he was
wanted, Shepherd denied that he was the
embezzler, but offered to go with the offi
cers. He said that he desired to put on
another suit of clothes before going to
Loai, and Coleman, knowing that Alex
ander Shepherd bore an excellent repu
tation, permitted the brother to go into
the house to change bis clothes and shave
himself. Shepherd returned presently
with a 38-caliber pistol and leveling it at
the Constable and Justice of the Peace, he
compelled them to get into the buggy and
drive away. He tnen returned into the
hou-e and took a dose of stryennine,
which he evidently carried with him in
anticipation of being arrested.
When the Deputy Sheriffs arrived on
the scene about 3 o'clock Shepherd's
body was still warm, but life was extinct.
The body was brought to the Stockton
Morgue to-night.

COAL NEAR SAN JOSE.
Excellent Quality Resembling Anthracite
Found Seven Miles From
the Ciif.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dsc. 19.â While exca
vating for a tunnel on the extension of
the railway in Alum Rock Park, seven
miles east of the city, several veins of
cood quality of coal were discovered.
The veins are from one to two inches in
thickness, and it it believed that a large
deposit of coal lies beneath the veins that
were uncovered. Several specimens have
been secured and tested. They are very
brittle and hard, resemble anthracite and
burn excellently. The . indications are
such as to justify the belief ttiat a large
coal bed exi.-ts, and in all probability bor
ings will be made.

SAVES A VALLEJO BOY'S LIFE.
Difficult Surgical Operation Prevents a
Youth Frcm Choking to
Death.
VALLEJO, Cal., Dec. 19. -Dr. Lewis
Carpenter, proprietor of the Emergency
Hospitai, recently opened in this city, has
successfully performed the very difficult
surgical operation of tracheotomy on the
14-year-old son of Milo Farmer. The boy
had been treated for membranous croup,
which had developed to such an alarming
state that his attending physician pro
nounced the case hopeless.
Dr. Carpenter was calleil, and, taxing
with him a trained nurse â Miss E. M.
Walker, a graduate from the City and
County Hospital of San Franciscoâ they
hastened to ttie beasi'le of the apparently
dying boy, who was being rapidly choked
to death by a false membrane in the
larynx. The boy was suffering untold
misery and writhing in auony. There
was no tirr.e to be lost, and as soon as the
patient had been placed in proper position
the operation of tracheotomy was com
menced. This operation consisted of cut
ting into the larynx and inserting a tube
to relieve the suffocation.
An incision about two inches lonz was
made in the skin, the knife then cutting
through three riniis of the trachea. As
soon as the opening was made the violent
exertions of the boy :n breathing forced
pieces of the membrane out of the aper
ture. The boy began to reviv# and breathe
more freely. Then a tube was inserted
through the opening in the throat.
There are now strong hopes that the life
of the boy has been saved, as indications
poiot to the fact that the false membrane
lias been entirely thrown off.

RIVAL HARBOR
SITES VISITED
Commissioners Spend a Day
at Santa Monica and
San Pedro.
Southern Pacific Agents Now
Attempting to Hide the
Real Issue.
Declare That This Is but a Contest
Between Their Corporation
and Another.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 19.â T0-day
Vras mainly employed by the opposing
forces in the great harbor fight in mar
shaling their adherents preparatory for
the struggle that will begin in the Cham
ber of Commerce building next Monday.
Huntington's people affect great indiffer
ence as to the outcome of the fight, rely
ing, as tney claim, on the "merits of their
case." This feigned indifference is well
understood by the friends of the free har
bor, who are on the look out for some un
expected coup by the monopoly.
Only one feature of Huntington's fight
Is in evidence: His men are attempting
to make it appear that the contest is be
tween the Southern Pacific and a rival
railroad company â the Terminal. This
they well know to be false; but, owing to
the Terminal people's activity, some show
of justification for the allegation exists.
The truth is, that practically all the peo
ple in this cud of the State, in every walk
of life, are in favor of the San Pedro port :
first, because they know it is a better
â place, made so . by nature; secondly,
they are of the firm conviction
that there never will be a free
and open harbor at Santa Monica,
no matter how much Government money
is squandered to enrich tiie Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company in the construc
tion of a breakwater to protect Hunting
ton's long wharf. The influence of a
Bingle corporation against the best inter
ests of the whole people is all there is to
the Santa Monica end of this light. No
one knows this better than Huntitigton.
The Harbor Commission went to San
Pedro on a special tram this morning
under the guidance of Superintendent
Iviuir of the Southern Pacific Company,
and proceeded by train out to the end of
the Southern Pacific track at Point Fir
nan, inspecting the harbor from the bluff
and also the Government military
reservation, through which the South
ern Pacific extension runs. Returning
before noon, it dismissed the guide at
the wharf and embarked on the coast
survey steamer Gedney, spending the rest
of the day coasting around San Pedro Bay
aud out as far as Portuguese Bend.
The commission then went on around the
point Santa Monica, from which place
it returned to Los Angeles this evening.
The day was devoted to a study of the
configuration of the land and water about
both sites.
MRS. POWERS DEPORCED
Decree Granted the Lawyer* Wife on the
(iround of Jieserlion.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 19.â Elmer
E. Powers, a former resident of this city,
a lawyer of promise and a very clever poli
tician, has been heard from in the courts.
At noon to-day Mrs. Clara I. Powers was
granted a divorce from him. No opposi
tion was presented and Mr 3. Powers was
awarded the custody of their 7-year-old
son, $25 a month alimony and $10 a month
for the support of the child.
It developed that Attorney Powers left
his home on Boyle Heights about two
years ago, stating that he would not come
back, but about two months aeo he re
turned and made an attempt at reconcilia
tion. He remained a few weeks and
when he left declared again that he would
never return. Mrs. Powers knew of no
reason jphy her husband should have de
eerted her, but some of the witnesses re
ferred to what they termed "incompati
bility of temperament." Powers, it is
eaid, has located in Denver, Colo.
VÂ»ed the Mails to Blackmail.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Dec. 19.â J. Hey-

the United States Grand Jury of having
used the mails for the purpose of black
mailing F. B. Schuyler of Oceanside. Mr.
Bchuyler had addressed a postal card to
the "doctor" at E3condido. This the lat
ter assumed to contain objectionable mat
ter, which it did not, and he sent a letter
from i'erris intimating that a sum of
money alone would prevent him from
prosecuting his correspondent.

BASIS MLECTIOy COATHST.
Democratic Supercisorlal Candidate Pre
fers Charge* of Fraud.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Dec. 19.â A. Silva
filed to-day with the County Clerk a con
test of the election of George E. Rln<Â» in
tne Third Supervisorial District of Marin
County. Ring was the Republican candi
date for the office and Sylva the Demo
cratic Ring received 366 votes ana Sylva
334.
The contest is based upon live allega
tions. The first is that illegal votes were
cast for Ring in Sausalito precincts one
and two, and in Mill Valley and Tiburon.
Second, that Ring committed certain
offenses against the election franchise,
violating the purity of election law, in
providing money to compensate voters,
buy drinks, etc. Third, misconduct on
the part of election officers in Tiburon,
Bolinas and Mill Valley, they returning a
majority of votes for Ring when in fact,
the contestant claims, Sylva had a ma
jority of tbe votes. Fourth, that the law
was violated in Bolinas, Mill Valley and
Tiburon, and that the votes cast in those
precincts should be considered void ; that
the officers of election were not appointed
from the electors of said precincts, and
other irregularities. And fifth, that the
vote of Bolinas Precinct is void, for want
of a reasonable observance of the pre
scribed conditions of the law for the hold
ing of an election, etc., and therefore
should be thrown out.
ASHORE NEAR CANDY LIGHT.
The German Bark Fotrimpos Strikes on
the Washington Coast During
a Fog.
ASTORIA, Or., Dec. 19.â With all lower
sails set before a light breeza the German
bark Potrimpos went ashore at Long
Beacb, on the Washington coast, a few
miles north of Canby light, shortly before
daylight this morning.
As it struck it rounded to and was
washed broadside upon the hard aand
beach, where it now rests high out of
water at half tide. The vessel was not
damaged, and all on board were landed
by the North Beach life-saving crew with
out accident.
The Potrimpos was from Mazatlan for
Astoria, under charter to the Portland
Flouring Mills. Reaching a point oppo
site the Columbia River late last night,
Captain Heilwedge stayed on deck, as the
fog was heavy, and attempted to keep the
bark moving in a circle until daylight.
There was no suspicion of propinquity
to the shore until the bark was in the
breakers, carried by the current which is
very strong along the coast there. The
anchor let go. but didn't hold, and the
Patrimpos drifted broadside upon the
beach.
At haif-tide the bark is clear out of the
water and rests easily on the sanils. Ex
perts predict the possibility of getting it
off without damage.
ELOPED SUBON SALT LAKE.
Flight of a Soung Man in Company
With a Variety Aelrntn.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 19.â W. S. Fer
ron cf Salt Lake is here in quest of his
son, Henry Ferron, about 26 years old.

ously sick; but so far Henry has not been
found in this city sick or well.
The young man eloped from home
with a variety actress six weeks ago, he at
tliat timo being supplied with plenty of
funds. He and his putative wife came to
Portland and lived in clover until Fer
ron's money dwindled to a low fignre.
Tnen they suddenly disappeared from the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
GREATEST NIGHT
OF FRESNO'S FAIR
Excursion Crowds Gaze at
the Wealth of Cit
rus Fruits.
San Franciscans Mingle With
the People of the San
Joaquin.
President Craig of the Board of
Trade Praises the Big
Display.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 19.â The cannons
roared with an unusual volume of thunder
this evening at 7:30 o'clock. The cannons
are used in Fresno to announce to the
people of the earth within hearing of their
reverberating tones that the great San
Joaquin Valley Citrus Fair is open for the
evening and ready to receive visitors. The
implements of war are thus used to an
nounce peace and unity between the coun
ties.
This was the great day and night of the
fair. It was Tulare day and San Fran
cisco day. The largest crowd of grown
people that has yet attended promenaded
slowly among the exhibits. There was
not a hitching post in the city that did
not have from one to three teams attached
to It. The farmer and his family came
from miles around. There were excursions
from San Francisco, Stockton, Tulare,
Hanford, Visalia and other towns in the
Villey, and visitors were here from as far
south as Bakersfield and Los Angeles.
The people from the latter city realized,
on beholding the beautiful and bounteous
exhibits of oranees, lemons and other
citrus Iruits, that there is now another
Richmond in the field of orange produc
tion and iv the trade. The unusually
large crowds, the bicycle races at the Bel
mont track, the horse races at the fair
grounds, the crowded streetcars and the
big pavilion, gave Fresno that metropoli
tan air which she hopes will be hers every
day in tne week in the future. '
The San Francisco yisitora were waited
upon at their hotels this morning by a
local committee of members of the Cham
ber of Commerce and the Hundred Thou
sand Club. In the afternoon a drive was
taken to points of interest in and around
the city ana through surrounding vine
yafds. Hugh Craig, President of the San
Francisco Board oi Trade, after taking
a view of the citrus fair this afternoon
said:
"lam surprised at this exhibition. The
San Joaquin Vailey, which has achieved
a reputation as the raisin center, by this
fair lets the world know that it is a pro
ducer of citrus fruits as good as any that
nra grown in the State. I have been to
citrus fairs before, but I have seen none
more attractive and significant than this.
I feel as Fresno and the people of the val
ley do. lam nroud ot it."
Fresno people turned out in numbers
that did them credit to-night. The band
played some extra selections and the
crowds were gcod-humored and cordial.
There was plenty of applause for the
speakers. The box-offices had an un
usually large stock of silver in the golden
surroundings, and the management looked
happier. Arthur R. Briggs, president of
the Fresno Chamber of Commerce, deliv
ered an address of welcome to the Kan
Francisco, Tulare and other visitors. He
said :
I was never more surprised in my life than
when I read in the newspapers this morning
that I wasto deliver a speech here to-night.
1 am very much like the young man â who had
to make a speech and did not know what to
say. The old man asked him if he had any
thing in' particular to talk about. He said he
had not. The old man toid him that in that
caae he had better talk about three minutes
and sit down. I shall talk to you about three
minutes.
I think Tulare County has had its day al
ready. Nobody could escape reading that
beautiful sign over there and (seeing tnat
great display of line" fruit. I tbinlc that most
of us will remember Tulare as long as we live.
Tpese citrus fairs do good. They bring the
people together. We take pride in welcoming
the people of the counties represented here,
and we welcome none more heartily then
those of Tulare. They hava come with their
fruits, witn their purses and hearts open.
As for San Francisco, I enn say the Chamber
ol Commerce, ihe Board of Trade and other
commercial bodies of that city received the
committee you sent ut> there heartily, and co
operated with us to make our mission a suc
cess. They treated us aa brothers. I
want to say here that San Francisco recog
nizes that the Sau Joaquiu Valley is
the heart of this great State of Cali
fornia, and that whatever is of interest
and importance to us is the same to them. Mr.
Craig not only gave us his sympathy and en
couragement, but he was the first to say he
would come.
By these exhibits the people of this valley
are brought into more intimate relations.
Now, when strangers in the State ask where
the citrus fruits come from they will be told
that they come from the San Joaauln Valley.
This valley vies with the world to-day iv tue
products which you see around you. We hope
to see our visitors from San Francisco and the
thousands from Tulare at the next citrus fair.
In responding, Hugh Craig expressed
thanks for the hearty welcome. Said he:
We have been accustomed to think of San
Bernardino, Orange and other counties when
we have seen oranges, and I must say that
this exhibition of citrus fruits here In the.San
Joaquin Valley is a complete revelation to
me. This is already known an the raisin cen
ter, but you show here that you can come to
the front with oranges and other citrus fruits
that equal anything in the southern part of
the State.
On the success and progress of the products
shown here depends San Francisco's prosper
ity. That has been burned into us in the last
three years. Without farmers and agriculture
there can be no commerce. Your interest Is
ours. We hope we may have mutual prosper
ity for years. We realize now how absolutely
necessary it is that the man who tills the soil
be the most prosperous in the State. It is nec
essary tnat we ro hand iv hand. No county
has mnde California known more throughout
the world than Fresno. We believe that the re
turn tide of Tsrosperity has come to stay.
In conclusion, Mr. Craig said he hoped
there would be legislation this winter pro
viding against the' mortgaging of home
steads, that the mother and the children
would always have a home as long as one
of them was in the land of the living. He
expressed hearty thanks for the hearty
welcome and entertainment in Fresno.
The fair will close Mondaj night. The
Pavilion will remain open to-morrow and
the band will play sacred music. A num
ber of Sunday excursion^ ara coming
from surrounding towns. The awards of
premiums will be made Monday night.
The weather is delightful.

THE SHERRY TRADE
An Inferior Quality of Winrg Has Di
minished the Demand for the Article.
The British Consul at Cadiz, in his last
report to the Foreign Office, discusses rery
fully the position of the trade in sherry
wine, in which Cadiz is largely interested.
For some years past the sherry trade has
been under the cloud which, either from
fashion or ttste, appears periodically to
affect one class of wines or another. Pos
sibly the importation some years ago of
cheap foreign spirit, with which unscrupu
lous dealers were enabled to fortify wines
of inferior quality and export them for
sale at low figures, may hure been the rea
son for this.
But now that the importation of this
foreien spirit is prohibited, and it cannot
pay to use anything but pure grape spirit
for strengthening the wines, which, ur.
less so treated, could not bear exportation,
the standard of purity is undoubtedly
raised, and especially as the Consul naively
observes, "the cheapest liquid in Spain,
hardly excepting pure water, is the juice
ot the grape, and the cheapest spirit that
made from it." When the juice has
been pressed from the grapes, it is run off
into butts and left for about six months
to ferment and fall bright. During this
period it develops a peculiarity unknown
in other wines, in the formation of cream
of tartar or flor de vino on the surface,
which gradually sinks to the bottom.
Wines which breed much of thi3 sub
stance are classed as Finos or Amontilla
dos, while those which do not, or only
breed very little, are known as Cloroso.
From the same grapes from the same vine
yard some of the butts will turn out to be
Fino and some Cloroso. To meet the
English taste many of them have to be al
tered in character by the admixture of
other wines of a sweeter nature and others
have to oe fortified with spirit to enable
them to bear transportation to other cli
mates. Aruonu; the principal growers and
shippers no adulteration is effected, but
the wines are. usually mixed ana blended
to suit the public taste, except in the case
of the very best vintages.
The Consul says: "It is unfortunate
that English sherry drinkers have not gen
erally acquire! a taste for the soft, dry,
delicate flavor of theshenies as they lie in
the stores as nature made them, for then
they are in their most perfect and delicious
state. The taste for sherry has of late
years greatly grown in the United States,
and the exportation thither is largely on
the increase. In England, also, the de
mand appears to be gradually increasing."
âLondon Times.
Rudyard Kipling as a Poet.
A sense of responsibility is no more to
be detected in Mr. Kipling's latest than in
his earliest work. Extravagances which
would pass in "Barrack-room Ballads" or
%ea "chanteys" reappear to mar serious
noble verse, snch as the dedication to
Wolcott Balestier. Tne line in that dedi
cation,
And they rise to their feet as he parses by, gentle
men unafraid,
which has given one reviewer much pain,
wili, perhaps, not equally nlflict most
readers. But most reader*, I think, will
agree that the colossal figure of the dead
who
Sit at wine with the Maidens Nino and tne Gods of
elder Gaysâ
Becomes Gargantuan, and that the step
from the sublime to the ridiculous is clear
ly taken in the verse
"Tis theirs to sweep through tnÂ« ringing deep
where Azrael's outposts are,
Or buffet a pÂ»:h throng u the Pit's red wrath when
God goes out to war,
Or hang with 1 he reckless Seraphim on the rein of
â¢ red- mane i star.
There is no use in multiplying in
stances. The reader has to own that good
taste is not in Mr. Kipling's line, that he
has not the tact and measnre and discre
tion for which Matthew Arnold exhorted
hia countrymen to resort to French liter
ature, and that he abounds in the "freaks
and violences" which the critic deplored.

Attempted to Ring a Professional
Pitcher in an Amateur
Game.
The" Tufts-Lyons Team Snubbed by
The "Examiner" and Its Super- â 
mtendent of Blackmail.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 19.-Little
by little all the circumstances attending
the bulldozing, contemptible methods em
ployed by Long Green Lawrence of the
Examiner in connection with the late
baseball game in the "trophy contest
engineered by that *'monarch of fakers"
are coming to the surface.
It is now known that the first reports of
Long Green's rank and coarse woK did
not contain one-quarter of the "funny
business attempted by this thrifty "jour
nalist" in favor of his pet team â the
Alerts of Alameda â and later the Stars
of Nevada and Monograms of Portland
against the Tufts- Lyons of this city.
For instance, nothing has heretofore
been said about Long Green's attempt to
ring in a professional pitcher in the game
of the Monograms against the Tufts-
Lyons, who acknowledged that he was
vastly over age. This pitcher is well
known in bali circles of San Francisco,
but seems to have too much decency to be
made a tool of by Long Green after tie
understood the situation. Then a Mr.
Fenimore was brought down from Port
land at Long Green's expense for tne same
purpose. This man is a professional and
greatly over age under the rules; but
these things did not trouble Long Green's
conscience. It was anything to beat the
Tufts-Lyons, by fair means or foul.
But the rankest gime of blnff in this
whole nefarious business was the threat
made to the Tufts-Lyons team that unless
the second game aeainst the Monograms
were played without Pitcher Harvey a
heavy suit would at once be instituted
against the Tuits-Lyous Arms Company
of this city. This coarse and brutal
threat was not made to M. M. Shields,
the manager of the team, but to the
youngest and most inexperienced mem
bers.
Long Green and his newspaper are al
ways prating about their liberality as en
tertainers and bill-Tooters, and yet it is
well known that on their latest trip to
San Francisco to play the finals by the
Tufts-Lyons team no provision had been
made to convey them to their hotel nor to
accord them asinele courtesy in any way
whatever. Friends from here taking pity
on the young men in a strange city with
out a chaperon provided them with tickets
to places of amusement.

efforts. In fact they have h^d so much
encouragement that they hsive been com-

hire a room where all can bear of the
progress of the movement.

the large number pf people who had called
at the secretary's place of business to offer
aid had seriously impeded his business

and that headquarters had been secured
at 2006 Mason street, where all informa
tion would be given out.
Letters have been sent to Senor Estrada
Palma. the leader of the Cuban Junta in
New York, s'sking permission to call a
mass-meeting for the cause, and an
answer is rxpected shortly.
A number of letters offerinc aid and
sympathy have been received, among
them one from a sea captain, who says
that he will take charge ot any vessel that
tne club may send to Cuba with men and
arms.
The action of the people of Los Angeles
in piving a pronounced expression of sj rm
pa'ihy on behalf oi the Cubans and their |
bic tight for liberty has touched a respon- I
sive chord in t is Ciiy. There ia a strong I
sentiment discovered by a casual putting
of the question yesterday by Call report
ers in favor oi following the example of
the southern city and calling a mass-meet
ing for the same purpose.
"Sued meetings should be held all over j
the country so that the hands of Congress
may foe held up in this matter," was the
general expression everywhere.
A ffw were not disposed to go as far as i
the Cameron resolution in declaring the j
independence of the Cubans, but the ex- :
pression was almost unanimous in favor
of calling a public mestinjr for the pur
pose of giving voice to the sentiment of
the people of this great City with regard !
to the barbarous conduct of the war Ly j
Spain.
"Public mass-meet in es, if held through
out the whole United States, would have
a most salutary inlluence on Congress"
said James H. Barry. "I believe as a Na
tion the United States would bo right in i
protesting against the barbarities of the
Spanish Government practiced upon the
Cubans, and tnr.t thi* short td, if necessary, j
go much further. The Cubans are right
ing for liberty, as our forefathers fought.
They are ntriiting for freedom from the
cruel yoke of Spain. A people who have
shown so much patriotum anct determina
tonto be free can never be conquered.
Millions have been spent, but billions
must be spentn t to suppress the 'rebels,' and
even then I doubt that they ever can be i
suppressed. lam with Cuba and for the
Cuban patriots with ail my heart, as I am
alwiys with the under dog when ho i*
right in any tight."
Mr. Barry was very severe in his criti
cism of Cleveland for his refusal to sanc
tion the action of Congress in recognizing
the belligerency of the Cubans long a^o.
He held that Cleveland's opposition was
nothing more than a desire on bia nart to
save the property of some rich friends in
! Cuba, which in case of Cuban indepen
dence would be lost to them. Nothing
but the most vigorous action on the part
of Congress upheld by the â¢'xr;te<ssf>(l sen
timent of the whole people would cause
Cleveland to aeree even now to the recog
j nition of the rigats of the belligerents.
General J. H. Dickinson was very pro
nounced in his opinion that Congress
siiould pass the Cameron resolution by
such a majority as to leave Cleveland no
alternative but to su-n it. He believed
that a mass-meeting should be held at I
once and a strong expression of the sym
pathies of the people for that resolution
and the fighting Cubans be given.
Joseph Leggctt favored the movement.
"Any people struggling for liberty should
have the warm, sympathetic support of
the people of the United Statesâ of all
j other people," he Raid. "The expression
of it should hava been given long ago.
! Had it boon uone in Â» strong, digniheu
way, behttine; the character and strength
of thiÂ« b:g Nation, them would have been
no talk of war now. But Cleveland has
hemmed and liawed and hesitated, en
couraging the bluster of Spain to that
degree that now its feathers are up,
and any radical action is likely to be fol-
I lowed by such rash steps on the part of
Spain as may not readily be retraced.
"1 do believe war would result from the
passage of the Cameron resolution even
now, but if we had taken the step which
we should h&ve taken in the first place
there would have been no fear of it. Years
ago, when we were a comparatively weak
Nation, no little people ever entered upon
a struggle for their liberties on this conti
nent that they did not receive a prompt
expression of the' sympathy of this coun
try and the fullest moral support. The
fpeling sprang spontaneously in the hearts
of the people and they never hesitated to
speak out. I nm in favor, of course, of
calling a public meeting for the same pur
pose now."
G. H. Cabaniss said: "My sympathies
are utrongly with Cuba, of course, hut as a
matterof international law 1 believaOlney
was ri ht about it. Ido not think the
time has come to recognize the Cubans as
having beVjuerent rights or for us to de
clare their independence. In order for a
people to gain the recognition of other
p?op!e in these regards they must have a
capita! and establish some form of gov
ernment. The Cubans have not done so.
They are merely wandering and fighting
over the islands and, therefore, cannot be
classed as anything more tha r i r. f ugee*
and insurrectionists My sympathies, as
I say, are with them, and I would favor a
public moetin?, as some good may come
of (ha:â by way of expressing our sympa
thies."
Rabbi Voorsanger declares himself
strongly in favor of American interer
ence in behalf of Cuba as ;igainst Spnin in
Â»he teirible war of extermination going
on in the beautiful island. He ft-.vors tne
railing of a public meeting to let Congress
know what the people of this C.ty think
about the matter.
H. E. Collier. Sriyckels buildin?, \V. H.
Chapman and ti. C. Milligan, offices in the
Mills building, all prominent attorneys,
are in favor of iecogmzing the belligerent
rights of the Cubans.
Mayor elect Phelan said:
'I have followed with interest the
action of the President and of Congress in
the matter of the Cuban question, but
i.aye formed no positive opinion as to the
wisdom ot the President's dilatory tactics
or of the apparent eag?rness of the Senate
to put this country on record in declaring
for the independence of Cuba. This niat
ler is in the hands of the President and
Congress and I do not think that the
people of SSan Francisco, so remote from
the seat of war, can bring any knowledge
to a consideration of tne question, and
hence I am not in favor of a mass-meet
ing. There appears to be no question
that, the sympathy of the people of this
coun'ry is, on general principles, with
out examination of the facts, in favor
of the Cubans. Subject colonies are r.ot
regarded with favor oy the traditional
policy of the United Statos and inter
ference in the government of the people
capable of self-government is, in the l;ght
of American ideas, indefensible.' 1
M. M. Miller, attorney and editor of the
San Francisco L gal News, would co
further than mere recognitionâ or at !ea-t
he believes that recognition would itseii
i iro further an<i he favors it. ''The recop:
! nition of belligerent rights in Cuba, cs
| pecially the declaration of independenrr,
will cert.nmly lead to annexation. Cuba
would immediately be flooded with that
large class of young Americana who are
out of employment or who are fretting for
I adventure. They wou!d be armed by
i wettlthy sympathizers. Vessels with arms
] could leave our porta unchallenged and
I the victory of Cuba would be made cer
tain. That would be the tirst step and the
second would follow. I am in favor of
calling the meeting immediately, and the
offering of all the aid that such a meeting
j could."
A PASSING OPPORTUNITY.
Final Announcement Kegarding Those
1- pedal' Encyclopaedic Dictionaries. .'
A few days ago the Pacific Coast News
paper Syndicate began a distribution of a
number of ; slightly marred sets, which
bad accumulated in packing, unpacking
and handling the many thousands of
volumes which were some time since dis
tributed to readers to introduce the work.
The covers on one or more oJ these
special sets were rubbed a littleâ so little,
indeed, that few purchasers at the regu
lar price of $43 to $70 a set would have any
cause fpr complaint. . â , . .
. As a mutter of fact, these special sets
are just as good as new for all practical'
; purposes, , and would ; com pare 1 favorably
with any absolutely perfect $42 to $70 set
that had seen a few. days' use in home,
library or office.

BRITISH REGATTA
UNDER TWO FLAGS
Rowing Races in Richard
sons Bay and a
Reception.
The Flagship Gienesslin Was
Gayiy Decorated for the
Occasion.
There Were Several Accidents on the
Bay During Friday Night's Fog,
but Ncne Were Seriom.
The water front was lonely yesterday
afternoon. Not a British ship captain
could be found around "Lime Juice" cor
ner and the officesof the stevedores, ship
chandlers, grocers and butchers were de
serted. No ships' boats were at the land
ings, and, while many of the vessels went
on discharging, stid some of the men man
aged to {.'et away to witneÃS the sport at
bausalito.
The occasion was the annual regatta
given by the British ships in port. The
flagship was t lie Gienesslin, and she pre
sented a pretiy appearance as she lay, be
decked with flans, in Richardsons Bay.
A dozen other vessels Kept her company,
and when the first race was called as charm
ing a tableau as has ever been seen inside
the Golden Gate was witnessed. It was a
race from start to finish between the boats
of the Travancore and Glenesslin. The
other entries were not "in it." as they
say, and the two boats' crews fought it
out alone. Tiie men on the Travancore
have an unbroken record to their credit.
Time and again they have won victories
for their ship, and when in Newcastle, N.
S. W., during the strike of the colliers,
they succeeded in winning the heat race
in which eighty ships' boais wer? entered.
Captain Pritchard of the Glenesslin had
great faith in his boat, however, and up
to ti:e last minute he was confident of
success. Tne Travancore had far and
away the better boat, however, and the
Gienesslin's was held safe almost from
start to finish.
In the dingy race there were seven
entries from the following vessels: More
ton, Kensington, Glenesslin, Snaicon,
Granada, Pega-ms and Bel ord. It was
nearly aÂ« exciting a race as the first one
and the Moreton's crew won easily, with
the Snaigon second and Belford third.
There was then a lull in the rncingand
Captain Priichard'3 gue-ts were given a
c ance to inspect his handsome ship.
Mrs. Captain Pearse of the ship Moreton
and Mrs. 11. Owens of San Francisco had
been busy for two days in getting
things ready for the occasion and the
calii :s of ihe Glenesslin showed their
sk li. Everything was in :ii>ple-iie order
and the dining-ioom would have done
credit to the best appointed house in San
Francisco. The vessel was decked with
flags and her handsome appearance can
be judged from the accompanying sketch.
Among the guests were Captains Lonnen
of the Halewood, Fraser of the Snaigow,
MouKon of the Pegasus, Smith and wife
of the Fairport, Peters of the Centesima,
Shaw of the Queen of England, Pittof the
Sutley, Wilson of the ferry steamer Sausa
iito and his twn sons, Masters Frank I)
and D)ui;lus 8., of the Largie
more. Frame of tne Northern hay, Mc-
Kinnon of the Bel ford, Jones of the Tra
vancore, P arse of the Moreton, Hattield
ot the Lancing, Caddell of the Cloncaird
ana others.
Among the outsiders, as they may be
called, were Dr. Chalmers, the loci! quar
antine officer, and Alexander McÃoyle.
Both of these gentlemen as-isted in a
great measure in making the regatta and
subsequent social gathering a success.
Then there were D. B. Murphy, L?o W.
Sliea, Commodores Harrison and Gutte
of the yacht clubs at Sausalito, Captain
and Master Hunt of San Franci'co, Mr.
and Mrs. Reuben Robinson, Cap'nin John
Sloan, Mr. and Mrs. William*," M-s. and
Mi:-s fa.rr, Miss Moore, JJr. and Miss
O'Brien, the Misses Stanley, Mrs. and
Miss Essleson and Miss Tweed and
George Ross, the well-known shipwright
'ihe first thing that met the gazo of each
guest upon entering the cabin was the
following:
Ladies and Gentlemen: Welcome on board
the BritishahipGteuesslin. The star-spangled
banner and tne union jack of old England
(long may they be seen dying together) float
over us. You live in a free and glorious coun

ACCIDENTS IN THE FOG.
The Or'zaba Ran Into Fisherman's
Wharf and the Montlcello
Went Aground.
The fog that came up in the bay in such
a hurry last Friday nierht was the cause of
several accidenis. The Paciiic Coast
Steamship Company's Orizaba, while on
her way from Port Costa, where she had
been delivering a quantity of ore at Selby's
smelting works, ran Into Fisherman's
wharf. The fog bell was not sounding at
the time, and Captain Yon Helms, blinded
by the light from Lombnrd-street s-lip, ran
his ship in too close and crashed into the
wharf. Over forty feet of piling was carried
away, and the damage to the remainder
of the wharf was considerable. The
Orizaba was not injured, and she will get
away on her regular trip pn Christmas
day as u->ual.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's leader, with three coal
barges and one lumber scow in tow, was
in collision witu the same company's T.
C. Walker. The iuxnber scow was disabled
and had to be run on the mud flat-.
The Vallejo steamer Monticello ran
ashore at 10:o0p. It., and remained there
hard and fast until 3:30 a. m. She was
then towed off by the Southern Pacific
Company's Herald", and proceeded on her
way. The Monticello was not damaged,
and was running as usual yesterday.
The new steam schooner Alliance started
on her first, trip to Coos Bay yesterday.
She will bring down coal for the Coos Bay
Coal Company in Her hold and a decKload
of lumber.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Coos Bay is disabled at San Simeon. One
of the mooring lines caught in her wheel
and she cannot turn over the engines in
consequence. The Santa Rosa, now on
her Wiiy here from San Dieso, will tow her
to San Francisco, and the Corona, now on
her way down the coast, will carry her
passengers to tiieir destination.
The Merchants' Exchange has received
the following:
PORT TOWNSEND, Dec. 19.â The schooner
Lettitia, from Guaymas, reports that on
December VI while twenty miles southwest of
Cope Flattery she passed through considerable
fresh sawed lumber and saw two bright
painted skiffs. The sea was too rough to
make a close examination. It is supposed
that the lumber is the deckload of some out
ward bound vessel. f
Mrs. Captain Hogan arrived here from
Australia on the Mariposa. She cam"
here to join her hust and, who is master
of the Chrysomene. She was taken ill ir.
Newcastle, Australia, and had to remain
behind. Her husband was awaiting her
when the Mariposa docked, his vessel

Pretty Good Jumper.
The Follansbee handicap at seven far
longs v/as decided at Oakland track yes
terday. Hardtack in England didn't
start because the bandicapper considered
him within two pounds as good a horse as
Mt. McGregor II and Ruinart, the latter
the crack thrÂ»e-year-oid of California.
Hardtack beat a gang of hounds at Ingle-
Bide and was delegated to carry 108
pounds, so Trainer Billy Randall wisely
declared. There were nine s-taners
though and as usual the Burns & Wa'er
hou?e pair, Wernberg and Mt. McGregor
11, coupled in the betting, ruled even
money favorites. The race was worth
?950 to the winner and sailing away in
front at the turn Mt. McGregor waited on
pretty Miss Chartreuse II to the stretch
and then beat her out a head. He was
jokine at the end, according to Jockey
Eddie Jones, and could have won by i.
Gallant, ridden by PebDle Thompson^
with 85 pounds in the saddle, showed an
inclination to swerve in the stretch, but
succeeded in nipping third money. Loben
gula, Ruinart and Lucky Dog ran disap
pointingly to th ir backers.
The day was pleasant and a large crowd
was in attendance. Favorites flattered
their backers by winning three race*.
Jockey Eddie Jones was very much in
evidence by riding three winners past the
wire.
Frank Phillips thought be had a good
thing in the first race with his mare Can
dor, who was made a 6 to 5 favorite; but
Kick Hall's La FJeche easily overhauled
her in the stretch and won easily from
tne favorite by a length. Jack Richlieu
was a third.
The second event was over seven fur
longs, and Merry Monarch, on which a
very warm tip was prevalent, occupied
the place of honor with 13 to 5 about him.
He got away from the gate and was kept
busy hoiding his own. Camelia, ai 30 to
1. gradually hopped along, and the last
few jumps snatched the purse from Flash
light by a face in I:32}^. Viking, a 150 to
1 chance, who looked a winner until oi>
pusite the paddock, linished a good third.
It is more than evident that Kamsin and
Jockey Golden have b come tract-sore, or
else "dope" books and field-glasses suould
be discarded. Ezell's gelding opened
equal favorite in the betting with Alva
rudo, but the latter horse got the patron
age and closed at even mom y. He won,
of course, and Doctor G, witii the wise

money on him for the place, finished
second, and how could it be otherwise?
In a Frightfully terrific drive Golden on
Kamsin did succeed ia taking place
honors from Can't Dance.
Jockey Slaughter is from Texas, and
so is Wade McLemore, owner of Ko
walsky. There was a wide and expansive
play on this Texas-owned horse; he evsn
closed second choice to Frank Brown's
Yemen, wiio was held at 9 to 5 closing.

Eighteen bookmakers cnt in yesterday.
Joe Ullmann handled the coin in vast
amounts, booking under the name of the
Oakland club.
The judges at Ingle9ide yesterday ren
dered a decision relative to the suspension
of Messrs. Short & Davis, owners of the
mare Sallie Sensible, which ran some
peculiar races at the local track. The
owners and Jockey H. Martin are exoner
ated from biume for her showing on De
cember 4, but ex-jockey Glover, who it is
claimed had charge of the mare on tnat
date, is suspended indefinitely and liis
badge is ordered taken Tip.
The running of the mare in future un
der the personal supervision of Mr. Short
will be watched with keen interest by the
public.
The track nt Oakland yesterday was in
fairly good condition. To give an idea of
what it was on Friday, Soniro, whc cap
tured ths first race, finished barefooted,
having lost both front plates in the gluey
foine. Reddirjgton, who was beaten out
by Palmersion, lost a front plate and
Cant Dance, another of Mr. Corrigan's
horses, finished with a plate nearly twisted
off one forefoot.
A. B. Spreckels thinks an injustice has
been done in barring certain horses from
the betting and states so in the following
letter to the judges at Ingleside.
Deo. 18, 1896.
Messrs. Jame* H. Rr.es and J. W. Wi son, Judges
Inglesrde Kacetra?k, â¢ ity -Gentlemen: My at
tention lias been callel to your ruling whereby
curtain bml-uctinj; liorses have been barred in
the boning on the InÃTesUie racetmtk. In my
judgment this rule is an injustice io owners
and will cause dissaUsinctiou as long as it Is
in vc gue. Owners, as a ruie, ire as blind to
the iuuiis of tht:tr noises as mothers are tothu
faults of their children. 1 suggest that in the
fu;ure you discontinue barring bad actors in
the betting, but in lieu thereof post a list of
the names of these horses with a notice to the
pub. ic tnat they will not. under any circum
stances, be permitted to delay the start. When
this is done parties betting on tht-se bad actors
do so with the full knowledge that they must
start promptly or be liable to be left at the
post.

GRAND JURY ON
PARK AFFAIRS
Cost and Material of the
Fine Bridge and
Tunnel.
An Army Engineer Employed
as an Exp?rt on
Concrete.
Irving M Scott, Lieutenant Potter,
Architect Coxhead and Superin
tendent McLaren Testify.
The Grand Jury, It transpires, has been
delving into accounts and having expert
examinations of material made to ascer
i tain if the very large sums of money ap
| propriated for the maintenance and im
! urovement of Golden Gate ParK have been
properly disbursed. It was observed yes
terday at the session of the Grand Jury
that First Lieutenant C. L. Potter, U. S.
A., Corps of Engineers, was one of the wit
nesses in waiting. What business the Grand
| Jury had with an eminent engineer was a
: matter to cause surprise. The officer de
l clined to enlighten outsiders in this
! respect, but subsequently it was ascer
tained that Mi. Potter had been engaged
as an expert to examine the concrete in
the bridge and tunnel near the museum
jin Golden Gate Park. His services were
sought by W. L. Ashe, Harry W. Goodall
and E. P. Farnsworth of the park com
mitteeâthree alert members of the jury.
The first witness called in the park in
vestigation was Irving M. Scott, president
of the Board of Park Commissioners. The
jurors asked him many questions concern
| ing ibe present and prospective plans of
i park improvements. In response to in
quiries he explained the board's system of
disbursing the money of the taxpayers
and described the permanency of the
work performed by the Commissioners.
Lieutenant Potter was the next witness
called. The main points of his testimony
may he >et forth in the final report to
Judge SlacK. It is surmised that Mr. Pot
ter's communications to the jury were in
a sons confidential.
Architect Coxhead, who has charge of
the construction of the bridge and tunnel,
exhibited plans and specifications to the
jury and replied to a great number of
questions, lie was followed by John Mc-
Laren, superintendent of the park.
The bridge and tunnel woik at the park
will cost about $30,000. The architect says
it is highly creditable to the park manage
ment. Mr. McCleilan is the contractor
for the stone work ; Gray Bros, have the
contract for the concreie work. The Park
Commissioners this year have an allow
ance of $250,000. Last year they expended
$300,000.
Supervisor Benjamin wa<Â» called to en
lighten the jury on the subject of drugs
and medicines for certain public institu
tions. He is chairman of the Hospital
C' mmiitee and a member of the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors.
The requisitions on which Wall^- Brothers

J pervi^or toid the Grand Jury that requi-
I sitions wern made because certain artices
required were not sapplied by contract as
tlje. should be. He did no: regard the
charges made by Waller Brothers as ex
orbitant. His experience taught him that
dealers were not anxious to sell goods to
the City.
Samuel Waller spoke his mind freely to
the Grand Jury. As soon as he toot his
seat in the jury-room August E. Drucker
began firing questions at him. Waller
testified that he charged a good round
price for articles required and that he
supplied the goods on requisitions issuer!
by Supervisor Benjamin. He thought
that it was the business the Finance Com
mittee of the board to withhold payment
if the prices charged were too hieh.
Mr. Waller testified that he furnished
articles to three jails, the Almshouse,
Morgue and City Receiving Hospital.

SPELL OF ELECTRIC RAYS
Its People Join in a Most Enthusiastic Celebration
at Night Over the Auspicious
Occasion.
Fireworks, Decorations, a Pa
rade and Banquet on the
Programme.
PICTURESQUE AND BRILLIANT
SPECTACLE.
Montgomery Avenue, Stockton, Kearny
and Pjst Streets All
Illuminated.
North Beach had its time to shine last
night. â¢
The rays of light were cast down upon a
scene the like of which for picturesque
ness and enthusiasm bad not been wit
nessed in the north end since the bon ton
of San Francisco used to promenade on
Stockton street a generation ago when
Stockton street was the ultra-fashionable
thoroughfare.
Then, too, the business part of the street
had prospects equal to those of Market
street to-day, and men of foresight be
lieved that the commercial part of future
San Francisco was destined to be centered
there. But for many a year the street was
lost savfl only to local trade. It had its
awakening last night. Between Pacific
and Union streets it has of late taken on
new hie.
The old buildings have mostly passed 1
away, ami in their stead are modern busi- ;
ness blocks, handsome stores in large va- I
riety with pretensions worthy of a down- '
down dealer, and many enterprising busi- !
ness men.
The shafts of electric-light crossed each
other 8t an acute angle, and therefore it j
might be said that North Beach fell under
the potent influence oi the X ray.
Mont ornery avenue shared the honors
equally with S'ockton street, a string of
arc lamps having been suspended from
Filbert street clear along the avenue to its
en l at Montgomery street. Stockton
street was a mix ure of fantastic Japanese
lanterns, colored decorations and excite
ment, all of which the avenue had, though
in a less degree.
Everybo y, it seemed, everybody from
the district included under the generic
title of North Beach, from Russian Hill to
the bay, was out. And everybody made a
night of it â on Stockton street. So the
crowd was too dense in that area to be
confined to the sidewalk*. The peopl
covered the street and hobbled over cob
bles, all for the sake of participating in
the Celebration which bespoke so much of
Confidence and civic pride.
The night was turned into day almost
by the newly l;trhted arc lamps hung over
head as permanent illuminators, the
stores were at cheir best with lights of all
d' scriptions, and Oriental paper lanterns,
with candles burning, were strung along
the sidewalks like beads of transparent
color, and in many places formed can
opies of lignt. One house vied with an
other in decorations, so that every store
was draped beautifully with light-hued
bunting, lestoons of everareen or flags,
while banners fluttered over all in two
r.ows at either side, and also across the
street.
The effect was, to say the least, very
striking. During the night colored fire
â¢was burnt at different places and a brasÂ«
band moving about played serenades. By
way of variety hot-air paper balloons were
set at liberty, and throngs of wildly ex
cited, yelling boys and the fireworks kept
the district in an uproar. Each store dis
played prominently a large card bearing
tne announcement, "We are members of
the Stockton-street Improvement Club."
Borne had suitable mottoes in the interest
of the north end of town.
Late at night a banquet was enjoyed by
the club in the Piedmont restaurant, 1316
Stockton street. The invited guests were
the present and incoming Boards of Su
pervisors, Mayor Sutro and Mayor-elect
Phelan. A hundred covers were laid and
a bounteous menu was spread. Mr. Bear
presided, but the toasts were impromptu
compliments to the North End aud the
club.
Montgomery avenue was decorated at
different places with lanterns, flags and
bunting, and appeared like a new street
under the gleaming white beads that dif
fused light where be f ore was darkness.
The northerly end of X amy street as far
as Pacific was likewise illuminated for the
lirst time.
The intioduction of electric light on
such a comprehensive scale in North
Beach was commemorated with a formal
celebration. About 8:30 p.m. a parade
along Stockton street took place, it was
preceded by a brass band in a iarge wagon
drawn by four horses.
Directly after the band-wagon followed
the club mascot, a large goat of the "'billy"
variety, decked in fancnul and gaudy
paraphernalia, and wheezing in disgust ai
the subordinate position he was forced to
occupy.
Billy evidently thought his proper place
as a connoisseur on tin cans and boot
leather should be at the head of the pro
cession, and the fact that two members
were delegated as an escort did not tend
greatly to mollify bis indignation.
Next in order was a vehicle drawn by
one powerful animal, with Mephisto in
the bed of the wagon feeding the red fire,
which cr.st its glaring light over tne scene
and produced a most picturesque effect.
The members of the club followed two
by two, and in turn were followed by
many representative citizens. The om
nipresent small boy was out in force.
T;.e parade started from Apollo Hall
and proceeded along Stockton to Union
street. The band played merry tunes on
the line of march, the streets, were lighted
up with the glare of redlights, firecrackers
were shot off in great bunches and the
populace kept up a constant cneerine.
Even the ladies waxed enthusiastic and
waved their handkerchiefs. This excited
the mascot's anger and he venied his ire
in a aeries of sneezea, at the same time
tugging frantically at the straps which
compelled him to be escorted.
When the parade reached the end of the
line of march J. Priester, the cratid mar
shal, delivered an impromptu address to
an immense crowd. "I appreciate the
ereat honor." said he, "to have been se
lected for the grand marshalship ot the
Stockton-street Improvement Club, as I
am only a becinner in the North Â£.nd.
"And I assure you I am deeply thank
ful to the club and to all the Mends of the
movement lor an improved and new
North Beach. â .
"I have a few favors to ask of theNortn
Beach folk on behalf of the club. We
have handsome stores rit:ht here in th
Norta End, with everything that you re
auire then why not stay here and patron
ize the merchants who live among you?
The money will all come back to you.
â¢'There is now every inducement lor resi
dents of this end of town to do their shop
mg herÂ«, the main business streets of
North Beach are brightly lighted, and we
hope you will help the enterprise."
Ihe Stockton-street Improvement Club
distributed freely amng the crowds an
elegantly printed programme, in which
the following address was published from
the club to the people of North Beach:
"The Stockon-Street Improvement
Club was organized December 7, 1896. The
organization is composed of all the busi
ness men and property-holders in the
north ond of the city; Us purpose of or
ganization is to force improvements in
the section of the City called North Beach,
which has so long been neglected that
people in general have forgotten that there
ever was a North Beach, which was at one
time the leading residence and business
part of San Francisco.
"Our first move in the way oF improve
ment is the lighting of Stockton street from
Union to Pacific with electricity. This
was accomplished after considerable work
byt he committee. There are a number of
improvements to be made in this section
o! the City, ami with the help of the resi
dents of the Beach we expect to accom
plish and push forward the work that has
been nenlected in years past
"All we ask of you is to patronize only
the members of ihe club who are working
for the good of the beach. Our next move
will be for better transfer privileges, more
light, etc. If you are a merchant or
property-holder come and join our move
ment."
The president of the club is Albert Bear,
ofthefirmof Bear & Buckley ; the secre
tary is L. Kutner, manager of Wagner's
candy store; the treasurer, J. KntÂ°rman,
and the sergeant-at-arms, J. H. VVessell.

MONTGOMERY AVENUE.
Brass Bands, Redf ire, Chinese Lan
terns and Firecrackers Make
Things Lively.
Along Montgomery avenue the scene
was one of unusual animation. Though
not quite so well ornamented with Ja
panese and Chinese lanterns, the street
possessed an air of gayety foreign to it
un'il the inception of the electric lights.
The original movement among the prop
erty-owners and merchants contemplated
only the lighting of Kearny street from
Market as far as California, but Messrs.
Peterson and Lundstrom took the matter
up and had the lights extended to Clay.
Tnis action Drought the ones who were
still excluded to a realizat on of the fact J
that all that was necessary to get the j
street lighted further was a little exertion,
and they decided to take action. The
principal mover in the reform was fid ward
Holland, proprietor of the Commercial
Hotel.
Mr. Holland at once interested the
many merchants in the notion of having
the lights extended not only from day
street to the avenue, but down the avenue
to Washington street and up as far as
Union.
His most earnest assistants were God
frey Leopold, in business at 420422 Mont
gomery avenue; I. & G. Jacobs, located at
613 Pacifac street, and Place Brothers, who
attended entirely to getting subscriptions
for lighting the two blocks southeast of
Pacific street.
Thus it came about that last night
found the avenue well ighted as far as
Filbert street. The extension from Union
street to Filbert was due entirely to the
exertions of John F. Winters, engaged in
business on the corner of Filbert street
ami Montgomery avenuÂ°.
Two bands in four-horsa wagons pro
ceeded up and down the avenue fiom Pa
cific to Filbert streets, rendering lively
airs. Several times they stopped in front
of Jacobs Brothers, the Commercial Ho
tel and Leopold's Bazaar and gave sere
nades.
Interest was added to the scene by Mr.
Holland buying several boxes of fire
crackers, 10,000 to a box, and sending a
small boy up the telegraph pole in front
of the hotel, where the long string was at
tached and then fireu at the end next the
ground. This procedure never failed to
attract an immen-e crowd.
At several places along the street red
fir was burned near the sidewalKs, keep
ing he whole thoroughfare enveloped in
a crimson glow. A wagon ablaze with
red fire also was kept moving up and
down.
There was no parade on Montgomery
avenue because there is no recognized im
provement club looking after its affairs.
The lighting of the street was dvÂ« entirely
to the enterprise of the unorganized mer
chants. It is the intention, however, to
effect a permanent organization in the
near future.
HAYES STREET IN LINE.
It Will Have Electric Lights From
Market to Laguna in a Few Days.
The march of progress in the way of
lighting the streets has reached Hayes
street, and the merchants will have arc
lights on the street in a few days from
Market to Laguna, and on Laguna to
Grove on the north and Fell on the south.
The movement was started a few days
ago by C. C. Rivers, grocer, and F. G. Fall,
and since then they have secured about
100 names to contracts lor one year, and
they expect to have the remainder by
Monday or Tueslay. '
They have not met with a single refusal
during their canvass. They have been
ably assisted by M. Schimetschek, Pete
Svetivich,*J. Harry Scott, Julius Layden,
F. C. Bechtel, Â£. L. Christin and John
Elder.
It was tho intention to have the lights
ready for Christmas eve. but that has been
lound impossible. A meeting of the sub
scribers will be held pro Dab y Wednesday
night, when definite ariangements will be
made for lighting the street, which will
be accomplished by New Year's.
Toere will be a light at each crossing
and two on each block, making, including
Laguna street, about twenty-four lights
altogether.
It was contemplated to include all the
cross streets the same as Laguna, tut it
waÂ« found advisable to abandon that part
of the rcheme for the present at least.
LIGHT COMPANY BUSY.
It Could Not Put Up Arc Lamps on
Several Streets.
The residents on Fillmore, Lnrlrin,
Ninth and Fourth streets, over which por
tions it was contemplated to have electric
lights shining last night, were disap
pointed.
This, however, was no fault of those
who clieerfuliv subscribed for the illumin
ations, but rather the inability of the
electric iin lit com Dan v to meet the re
quirements of the many applications

lamps.
Promises have been made dv the com
pany to hare all the streets for -which it
now has requisitions on file ready by the
Ist of January. Powell street, however,
will be in condition to celebrate on next
Saturday evening.
Post Street Was Ablaze.
Post street, from Stockton to Montgom
ery, was also bathed in a brilliant light
last night for the first time. Electric
lamps- were hung along the middle of the
street, and many more lights were on the
sidewalks.
The result was dazzling and the street
seemed much improved in consequence.
Merchants along the street were most en
thusiastic and had quite a celebration of
their own.
PICTURES FOR CHARITY.

Bob Fitzsimmons, his wife and manager

that Corbott will be accommodated with
a Â£ood side wager and that he will Bee him
in a week or bo to arrange particulars.
"If Corbett is not satisfied with a side
waeer of $10,000 I think I can raise $25,000

sort of way. "I do not believe because

"I met Sharkey this afternoon and the
fellow held his head town, while his eyes
were rivete I on the sidewalk as he passed
me. I always thought Sharkey held his

j that the purse be won by a foul decision
belonged to me and that is why he
dropped his eyes when he passed.
"Well, this is not the first time I have
j had to put up with a wrong decision.
"In a six-round contest with Choynski

a draw, when I bad all the best of the con

I had knocked Choynsui down at least a
i dozen times. I think the referee would
have civen a decision in favor of me had
not the captain of police lustructed him to
make it a draw; but all the papers
roasted the decision, which they said was
of the rankest kind.

SUTRO IS AGITATED.
He May Enjoin the Supervisors From
Paying for the City
Map.
Mayor Sutro is preparing a caustic mes
sage to the Board of Supervisors at its
meeting on Monday next on the subject of
the City map.
Hi 3 Honor is convinced that a majority
of the members of the board are in favor
of ailowine the claim of Surveyor Tilton
in spite of the veto, and he is preparing to
fight the measure to the last gusp.
It is probable that an injunction will be
taken out by the Mayor in case the Super
visors pass the Surveyor's bill and order it
paid.
"This map is one of the greatest out
rages ever perpetrated on the public," said
Mayor Sutro yesterday- "It is inaccurate
and incomplete, and I am told that such a
map can be made for $4000, whereas the
City Surveyor is to receive $10,000. Before
being accepted the map should be turned
over to some such man as Professor David
son to report on its accuracy. It is said
that lam an interested party. Of course
I am. lama large property-owner, and
there are 100,000 more who want an accu
rate map, so tnat their interests can be
protected.
'â¢The City and County Attorney should
look aftt-r th s matter, but he is the crea
ture of the Supervisors and refuses to do
as 1 ask him. I shall send a message to
the Supervisors on the question of this
map and may also take other proceed,
ings."
CLOTHING IN FLAMES.
I>. V. Merle's Establishment Damaged
by Fire La-it Evening.
L. V. Merle's clothing and iurnishine
goods store, corner of Commercial and
Kearny streets, was damaged by fire last
evening to the extent of $2500.
It is not known just how the fire started,
but it is presumed that an overturned
lamp was responsible. The flames were
first seen in a rear show-window, and an
alarm was sounded through box 2L
The department responded prompt
ly, but owing to the smoke,
which poured in volumes through the
store's windows the work of extinguish
ing the flames was accomplished with dif
ficulty.
The fire patrol succeeded in covering a
large portion of ihe goods with tarpaulins.
This prevented damaged by waer to several
thousand dollars' worth of goods which
would otherwise hay? been ruined.
It is estimated that $300 will cover the
damage to the building, which is owned
by Mark 6heidon.
Frank Doheny, an extraman of 2enÂ«ine,
while fighting the fire in the smoke and
dark, erasped a broken showcase ttnd was
severely cut about both hands. His in
juries were dressed and he returned to
work.

ATTORNEY LAWSON
MAKES A FIND
An Old Act Preventing
the Laurel Hill Ceme
tery Cut.
The Legislature of 1859 Forbade
the Laying Out oi Roads
There.
Those Who Are Opposed to the Pro
posed Extension of Sutter Street
Are Elated.
Those who are opposed to the extension
of Suiter street through the Laurel Hill
Cemetery find their case strengthened by
a discovery made by W. A. Lawson, an
attorney, who recently addressed a meet
ine of citizens of Richmond in reference
to the scheme, and who is consistently
and actively opposed to it.
The Legislature in 1859 passed an act
which authorized the incorporation of
cemetery associations. Section 10 of that
act provided that so long as the land
should remain dedicated to the purpose
of a cemetery "no street, road, avenue or
thoroughfare shall be laid through such
cemetery."
The Laurel Hill Cemetery Association
was incorporated about 1867. The provi
sion of the act as above quoted is held by
those who oppose the Suiter-street exten
sion to be in the nature of a covenant with
ail cemetery as-ociations incorporated un
der that law. "I think," said Mr. Law
son yesterday, "that the provision was
designed to create a safeguard against just
such an unwarranted invasion of burial
grounds as is now proposed. Persons
who have purchased 1 ts from cemetery
associations and buried their dead in reli
ance upon the protection provided by this
act have a vested right which should not
be disturbed."
The privileges conferred by the act are
still in force, Mr. Lawson also said, at
least as to all cemetery associations organ
ized prior to 1873, when the codes went
into effect. The provisions of the Civil
Code, under the title of "cemetery corpo
rations" are, in the main, taken from the
act of 1859, omitting the clause relative to
the opening of streets through burial
grounds.
Section 3105 of the Political Code, under
the title of "cemeteries and sepulture,"
provides that the tide to lands used as a
public cemetery, so Mr. Lawson also says,
becomes, after live years of use, vested and
the land must not be used for any other
pnrposs than a public cemetery. This has
been mentioned before in the present dis
cussion as applicable to Laurel Hill Ceme
tery, but it has no relation to cemeteries
owned by private corporations or pur
chasers of lots Irom such organizations.
Captured a Burglar.
A. Fedora, who occupies one of the stalls in
the market at 524 Clay street, captured Friday
night a sneakttiief whom he expected and
laid in wait for as the man worked his way up
into the market trom the basement, where, as
developments proved, he had been in the
habit of secreting himself during the day.

TOO MUCH JOHNSON.
Detective Â£agan Looking Up Warrants
for Jurors' Fees for the
Grand Jury.
Detective Eagan spent yesterday inves
tigating the matter of warrants for jurors'
fees,. which were referred to him by the
Grand Jury.
It was explained to him at the County
Clerk's office that there were two men
whose names were similar, and that the
assignment, which was said to be a for
gery, was made by one of these and that
the trouble arose over the other present
ing his warrant and being confronted by
the assignment of bis iiame-ake.
Mr. Eagan then called at the office of
the Harding Collection Agency, which
holds the assigned claim, and Manager
Ganiaee explained the concern's connec
tion with the matter.
He exhibited an assignment from Wil
liam Juhnstone, secretary of the Lethnet
Water and Land Company, whose office is
at 819 Market street.
The other claim is that of William
Johnson, a contractor, who lives at 2210
Mission street.
These two claims are the ones that have
caused the trouble and it is expected that
the matter will be settled to the satisfac
tion of the jury.
SWALLOWED POISON.
L. Ka*mussen, a Tailor, Dying at the
Receiving Hospital.
â  L. Rasmussen, a tailor at 17 Polk lane,
was found in an unconscious condition in
his snop last evening. He was taken to
the Receiving Hospital and Dr. Thomp
son, after an examination, came to the
conclusion that he had swallowed poison,
probably strychnine. The usual remedies
were applied, but the doctor expressed the
opinion that he would not recover.
Rasmussen is a man about 50 years of
age, and ills supposed that be swallowed
the poison in a fit of despondency. His
clothing was in a wretched condition.

THE PRESS CLUB JINKS
WAS A DECIDED SUCCESS
An Evening of Song, Short Speeches and Clever Papers
Inaugurates the Yule- Tide of
Bohemia.
A Hit Made by the Newspaper
Club Before Many Assembled
Guests.
MUSIC AND WIT ARE MINGLED
Sire Melvin Captures the Crowd With
His Humor andjudga Hunt Reads
a Paper on Politics.
No jinks or other club entertainment
ever presented to its friends by the Press
Club succeeded in making a better hit
than the Yuletide jinks at the clubrooms
last night
The attendance of representative people
was large, including artists, musicians,
men of affairs, members of the learned
professions and distinguished visitors,
such as General Forsyth and Editor Tay
lor of Boston.
The cozy, softly-tinted rooms were
neatly decorated and by 10 o'clock the
programme was well started. The strik
ing features were musical and literary, the
great hits of the evening being made by
the sire, Harry Melvin, by musical celeb
rities and bright newspaper men, judges
and others who participated, in the exer
cises.
The Christmas tree, presided over by
Judge Low, made a big hit, for many
unique little presents were made, accom- i
panied by appropriate legends on tags.
President Coe demeaned himself with
rare dignity, smiling when the various
members made a hit.
Fred Myrtle was a very active spirit dur
ing the evening, singing, managing and
doing all in his power to make things go
off with a hurrah.
The programme opened with a snappy
musical sKit called "The Assassination of
Dull Care." Messrs. Shaughan, Myrtle,
Henley, Coffin. Ward, Melvin, Tucker and
Tilton, dressed as monks with gowns and
cowls, sang songs, did dialogues and put
Dull Care, an old graybeard, to death.
Myrtle represented Bacchus and made
a strike with his song, entitled "By the
Light of My Red Nose."
Quic&ly following this, Sire Melvin
brought down the house with his droll
wit in introductory remarks.
"I have gone to great expense," he said,
"to get a responsible commercial agency
to look up the standing of all who are to
participate to-night [laughter], and you
shall hear of each one's standing before
you hear him." The sire then read the
ratings and humorous biographies of
many, and tue rating of some was strange-
Jy marked "Nit," while others were placed
cabalistically, "N. G."
Sire Meloni's address was partly poet
ical, somewhat historical and reminiscent.
The humorous passages brought down the
house.
The Christmas-tree was laden with odd
presents that inaue great hits, particularly
by reason of the ciever wording of some
of the iaoels. One of the best was written
by Le Roy Levings, accompanying a
"straight flush" given to Paul Cowles. It
ran as follows:
Here. Paul, Is what for years your heart
Has longed for moat of all,
And lacking it you've had to part
With shekels large and sma 1.
Tbat Vime is put; now comes a bliss.
To make men pause and ponder,
And bend reluctant knee to tbis
Mob: beautiful "(juzonda."
Judge Hunt was presented with a very
heavy fisning-rod. The Judge is fond of
.elling angling stories, wherefore the fol
owing card with the li3hing-pole:
Scene in the Rooms of the Press Club When the Yuletide Jinks Had " Caught On/
With this nine-onnce rod, and line and book.
We trust you'll wblr) your favorite brook;
This may look heavy for the trout you'll take,
But it fits yonr flsh stones, np to date.
Fletcher Tilton, the club's great profes
sional musician, is said to use the tele
phone a great veal, for which reason he
was presented with a miniature telephone,
with the following poetic explanation:
For some time past your friends have seen the
bother
1 hey gave yon when they used the 'phone.
The club hag, therefore, got another,
And this, my boy, is all your own.
Dr. Marc Levingston drew from the tree i
a check for $25,000 with the following I
verse :
No more with fevered brow and lips a-pallng
You'll have to work with lancet, leech and pill;
You're wealthy, now, do need to tend the ailing,
For here Is your fee, sir, from the pencil will.
Sire Harry Melvin was given a small
launch to enable him to get to Oakland,
"by reason of the calamity of frequently
missing the last boat."*
One of the marked papers of the evening
was by Judge Hunt, being an essay on
the. Australian ballot, supposed to have
been written by a little boy. It. is as fol
! lows, being full of local hits. The paper
was loudly applauded :
Teacher told me I must write a composition
on the Australian ballot. Now, I knew
nothing about the Australian ballot or how it,
worked or how it looked, bo I thought I would
ask pa. My pa works in the new City Hail, on
a bench. I thought he ought to know some
thing about the Australian ballot, because he
ran ior Judge in the last election and nearly
got left. A physician named Dr. Phillip Crim
mins told him if he hadn't beeu so thin he
would never have squeezed through. He also
said tnat the men elected on the ticket must
have been very good men, because none of
them were below pa.
When I asked pa what he thought of the
Australian ballot he said he thought it was â
and then he stopped and told me to go and see
the professor. So I went and saw Professor
Martin Kelly. I asked Mr. Kelly if be liked
the Australian ballot. He told me he did; he
said it paid him better than his junksbop or
his libel suit against the Examiner. I didn't
know what he meant by this, co 1 asked him
how many times the ballot had been tried in
California. He said it bad been tried three
times in Sausalito.
I asked him when was the last time It was
tried and he said the third time. Then I
asked him why so many fourth-class men ran
on the Australian ballot at the last election
and he said it was becauje there were no fifth
j class men. I next asked him how it was that
some of his candidates got si:ch a bigger ma-,
jority thun others on the same ticket and he
said it was because they got more votes. Then
I wanted to know why they called the ballot
the Australian ballot and he said it was be
cause it came from Australia.
I asked him which was heaviest on
the candidate, the nomination or the
election? and he said both. I asked
him how candidates liked the Austral
ian ballot? He said it depended whoily on
how they came out; for instance the man
elected to office for the first time thought the
Australian ballot was bully, because it elected
him. The man re-elected lo office took no
stock in it, because be knew he was not elected
on the ballot, but upun the "stuff."
I asked him how much an official when elect
ed got. He said he diet not know how much an
official got, but he could tell me what his sal
ary was. I asked him if good men were not
usually beaten for office, and he said that he
had seen the righteous forsaken and their seed
shy of voles.
The lasi thing I asked him was if he made
more on his convention than he did on the
election, but he got mad at this and fired me
out. Just as I was leaving ho hollered and j
asked me what Da's name was, because he said [
if pa, ever ran for office a?ain he could get him
lots of votes south of Market street.
Then I lelt Mr. Kelly and started for the Hall
of Justice; but when I found the Hall of Jus
tice was not built I went to the new City Hall.
The Hall of Justice is so called because police
courts will be held there. I went to the Regis
trar, Mr. Hinton, ana asked him to show me
an Australian ballot, and he did so. The Aus
tralian ballot is a large sheet of paper, and it
is tqcare, at least, in form. It is laree, so as I
to hold the names of a.l the candidates.
The last ballot had so many names upon it
that I thought at liist it was the proof-sheet of
I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
the Directory. Mr. Hinton told mo that there
are always five times as many candidates as
offices. He saia that with one exception there
never was an election, either before the Press
Club got into debt or since it get out of it,
when there were just as many offices as there
were candidates, and that time was at the last
election of the Board of Freeholders.
lv. the late frea-for-all scramble for offices
there were forty-five places and 270 candi
dates; so there ought to have been at least
225 more offices to go round.
Mr. Hinton said be did not know who in
vented the Australian ballot; he knew who in
vented barbed-wire fences, Hamburg steaks
and Supervisors, but no one knows who dis
covered the Australian ballot, although since
the last election hundreds of men have been
looking for him hard.
The Australian ballot is printed upon paper
which is tinted pink. Before it is printed
some one advertised for bidsâ not for the bids
of Tehama street, but for offers in writing in
which the man who wants the job bids the
amount which he expects to make off it.
When the ballot is printed every candidate
has a number, and oiten all that the voter
knows about the candidate is his number.
Each candidate is also branded with his
party designation ; thus R. stands for Republi
can, S. for Socialist, N.-P. for Non-Partisan
and N. G. fo- the crowd. Sometimes the voter
don't care either for the number or the name
of the candidate, but votes solely on the
brand.
A convention nominates candidates; a con
vention consists of two or more bosses, who
call themselves United Labor or Independent
Republican or Gold Democrats, but the only
way you can tell the difference between them
is by the name.
When a convention won't nominate a can
didate he gets on the ballot by petition; that
is, he gets three or foiw thousand people who
do not know him to sign a paper at 10 cents
per head, sayinÂ» that he is tiie best man in
the country for the place; and then they
leave a blank for him to fill in any place be
wants. This is a cheaper way of getting on
the ticket than by nomination. A nomination
costs nearly as much as the horse show.
For an office witn a big salary like Auditor
there are usually three or four candidates,
but for the office of School Director, who gets
no salary, there are usually about on- hun
dred candidates. I asked Mr. Hinton why so
many men rnn for an office without pay, and
he s&id that if I ever served as a School Di
rector I would find out.
If a voter wants to vote for any candidate on
the Australian ballot he takes a little stamp
and puts a cross at the end of tho name, notiu
the middle of the name, as he does when he
writes his own signature. When be votes for
a Superior Judso he finds seventeen candi
dates for that office.
He cannot vote for the whole seventeen, but
he can vote for one only. Such v vote is
called a plumper. No one believes in plump
ing except the man who gets the plump ; then
iie says the voter is a good citizen. But If the
other fellow gets the plump he says the voter
is a fool.
It is said that in the last election there were
occasional instances of plumping. Some voters
voted for two Judges, some Rtood three and a
few went four, but 3400 voters could not pick
one. If a voter voted for five Judges his
vote would be no good, because .'our were as
muny as the public could stand at one elec
tion.
On the Australian ballot the names of the
candidates are printed alphabetically; some
candidates say that position on the ballot
affects the result, and that a man whose name
commences with Q never can be elected to any
office, except to an unexpired term on the
Board of Freeholders. But this rule did not
work in the election of 1894, when S standing
for Sutro beat Â£ standing for Ellert.
Before a voter can vote he must be regis
tered; that is, he must goto the Registrar's
office and give his name, if he can remember
it; then the Registrar looks at his teeth to
'.earn his ase, measures him to get his height,
ami if the voter has any peculiar mark about
him as marks oi intellect, the Registrar care
fully notes it.
Tho next trouble for the voter is to find nis
polling place. The one nearest his houne is
usually the wrong. one. When, however, he
finds his polling place he can go in and vote,
provided some one else has not already voted
for him to save him the trouble nnd provided
he answers his new City Hall description, and
provided he is not in the wrong district or in
the wiong county and is able to read and
write.
If he is allowed to vote, they give him an
Australian ballot and be goes into a little
place that looks like a stall, and there he
wrestles with his ballot. In selecting the
candidates the voter is usually intelligent and
discriminating; thus he will vote fcrone man
because he don't know him, opainst another
because he does, for another because he
runs independent, for another because
all of the conventions bave nominated
him, for another because he likes his
picture and for another because bis name
commences with A. Aud lastly, he is ex
pected to put some monoy in n cigar box ujicn
the clerk's table, which is marked "Charity"
or "Fcr the Poor." The box is marked in this
way because all of the money put into it
goes to the Big Jim Fund, to provide cots in
the wards south of Miirket street for disabled
stuffers.
A clever paper was read dv Wells Drury,
being a travesty on hifaiutiu' journalism,
as practiced by the grandiloquent in rural
regions. Many of the strong point.-* of the
paper were made emphatic by the delight
ful reading, and were of that evanescent
character that cold type cannot portray.
A paper by Grant L. Carpenter was of a
similar character. It was well read and
the humorous points brought down the
house.
The violin music of Mollenhauer was
one of the great hits of the evening, as was
the singing of the quartet and of
Abramoff, McÃridf, Homer Henley and
John J. Raffael. Ferris Hartman enter
tained the audience with humorous
sketches, Edward Moron made a brief ad
dress, and the entire evening was passed
pleasantly.
The following, among other dis
tinguished guests, were present during the
evening:
Attorney E. S. Pillsbury, General C. H.
Taylor, Carroll Cook, Adam Herold,
George H. Bromley. S. M. Shoruidge,

Mayor-elect Jamee Phelan, who had
come in with General Forsyth, General
C. N. Taylor of ttie Boston Globe and
others, was called for and made a very
happy speech, in which he referred to the
recent campaign and the attitude of the
press.
His address was coupled with amusing
stories and pr6vokcd much mirth. He
referred to General Taylor as the founder
of a great newspaper and intimated that
if he were called on he might teil interest
ing things about Boston, the newspapers
and how they do politics there.
Colonel Taylor took the stand and
made a good speech. He alluded to the
fact that he had filled every position on a
daily paper and said the happiest expe
rience ot his life was when he was simply
doing reportorial work.
He said it was the duty of those collect
ing the news to make the papers as clean
as possible. He also told amusing stories
and they were received with nm:h ap
plause.
Judge C. A. Low, attired as Santa Claus,
distributed Christmas presents from a
trci\ calling the recipients to the stand in
each ca3e and reading a bit of humorous
verse. The gifts and the verses were of
great variety, and in the nature of takeoffs
on the members.
In spontaneity, polish, warmth of en
thusiubm and respectable conviviality last
night's yule-tide jinks outshone every
previous effort of the club in that direc
tion. The speeches were timely and
witty, just long enough as a rule, and the
entire spirit of the entertainment was
harmonious and beautiful. While none
of the papers bore the evidence oi the mid
night oil neither were any slighted in
that finish that stamps the writer as one
accustomed to aging ii is pen.
In connection with the success of the
jinks and of the club itself it is not unin
teresting to recall a faw facts concerning
the origin and early history of the organi
zation. In the language of Fred Myrtle,
historian of the club: "The start was for
a few years a hard struggle against pov
erty, prejudice, opposition' and lack of
I confidence."
The club of to-day began in July, 1888,
starting in two rooms on Bush street, near
Montgomery. Soon after this crude start
I larger quarters were taken in what is now
the Fauntleroy, Stockton and O'Farrell
streets; but there was no marked progress
until the former quarters of the Bohemian
Club, 430 Pine street, were secured. The
career as a social organization then began,
though until the reign of President
Cassius M. Coe and a businesslike board
of directors the organization was always
in financial shallows. For more than two
years the present quarters, 126. Kearny
street, have been occupied, and to-day
the institution has money in the bank.
The following are the officers who to-day
guide its destinies: President, C. M. Coe;
first vice-president, J. P. Booth; second
vice-president, James McMullen; third
vice-president, W. r. Bogart; secretary.
[F. S. Myrtle; Ueasurer, P. S. Montague;
librarian, W. K. Briggs; directors â C. A.
Low, Paul Cowlcs, Dr. P. If. Jones, L. L.
Levings, C. A. Webster, E. D. Dement.
For several years after the club was or
eanized many journalists held themselves
aloot, laughing at those who struggled to
build up such an association, referring to
th- failures of the past. To-day, however,
many of the very best reporters and editors
in the country are on either the active or
non-resident lists and no man however
great his fame need be ashamed to be on
the roll of the San Francisco Press Club,
which is known all over the country a3 one
of the most progressive bodies of news
paper men in the United States. It has
rejoined the International League of Press
Clubs, and in J une last two of its members.
President Coe and F. C. Roberts, attended
the annual convention of the league at
Buffalo, N. Y. The reception accorded
them by the Eastern journalists showed
beyond a doubt the esteem in which the
California organization is held.
The following is a list of those who con
stitute the active, associate and non-resi
dent members of the club:
Charles A. Alken, E. M. Adfnns, H. S. Allen,
R. Porter Ashe, John Aiton, Dr. W. Anderson,

A LOST SEA GULL.
For Twehty-Four Years He Had Win
tered at B rentons Reef Lightship.
Captain Fogarty and his men are mourn
ing the probable death of Dick, the sea gull
that became famous for having passed
twenty-four consecutive winters on or in
the vicinity of Brentons Reef lightship,
about two miles off the south shore of New
port. Dick began to attract attention
nearly twenty-four years ago, because
about Octobsrl of each year he would ap
pear off the lightship and remain near it
till about April 1, when he would fly north
ward for the summer. As years passed
and there was no break in the regularity of
Dick's coming and going his fame grew
and. not a few persons visited the lightship
toseehim. Focarty and his pre
decessors have been called upon to write
many ietters regarding the gull and there
have been hundreds of inquiries fiom
people as to whetner the stories about Dick
were true, said a recent dispatch irom
Newport, K. I.
Last winter it was noted that Dick was
quite fenble with age and it was suggested
that he be shot ana stuffed for exhibition
in the Smithsonian Institution, for it was
thought that lie would never be able to
get back to the lightship, even if he sur
vived tho winter. But Captain Fosrarty
and his men refused to harm Dick. They
wanted very much to have the gull's body
mounted, but they were so much attached
to him that they would do him no injury.
They were willing to await his natural
death, trusting that he would die where
they could secure his remains. It ap
pears, though, from his failure to ap
pear at the lightship so far this fall, that
ne has died in other parts, and the half
dosen scientists and institutions who
hoped to have his remains will be disap
pointed.
It may be that Dick had been a regular
visitor at the lightship for more than
twenty-four years, but if so he had not
made himself known. The first that i
remembered of him was in the winter of
1871-72. He was a gray gull, a species
that is not considered very rare. Early in
his career at the lightship he had remark
ably smooth and bricht plumage, but as
years went by he gradually lost hisoeauty.
and during'the last few winters he pos
sessed a very shabby coat. He was roy
ally treated by the captain and men of the
lightship, who had his meals, of salt pork
mostly, prepared on time, and when the
hour arrived for Dick to eat he would call
for his food under the side of the boat.
Besides his regular habits, Dick had other
very remarkable characteristics, one of
which was his desire always to be alone.
Uniike otneri of his kind, he was never
seen with other gulls.â Philadelphia Tele

TO men who have wasted the vivacious energy of youth by
excesses or high living; to men ,who have found the spark
of vitality growing fainter, and who have, while yet young in
years, found the spirit of manly power lessening as if age had
come on and brought with it the decay of all physical and vital
energies; to such men, and to all men who feel that their vital
forces are slow of action and lacking in the fire of youth Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt is worth it weight in gold.
- A means of restoring youthful vigor is priceless. Nothing in
this world is worth more to a man who lacks that element.
And yet here is a remedy which thousands of men need, and
they fail to grasp it because of fear that it might fail.
"I had a continual pain in ,my back , and up my : spine for three years until I got
ray belt of you. I put it on at night and it gave me relief at once. I can now sleep
sound, which I could not .until I got your Belt. I shall always sneak well of it,"
writes A. B. Graves, 214 North Third street, San Jose, Cal., Dec. 8, 1896. .
It is hard to believe that Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt will do
what ..is claimed for it until i you speak to some -one who has
tried it.
'^ "I was troubled with my stomach, for more than ten years with terrible pains and
vomiting,: besides other general weakness. . Since using your Belt, which I eot last
February, I have been free from all those troubles. .1 consider it a grand thing for
those in need," writes M. C. Beckwith, Fresno, Cal., Nov. 25, 1896. .
Your most intimate friends are using it and being cured.
They don't mention it because ; few men want any one to know
that they are in need of such a remedy. ;.. J ; . â 
"Fifteen years ago I. was hurt by a fall, injuring- my spine and wearing my whole
system. My sexual powers were gone when 1 got your Belt last April. I was so weak
1 could not stoop to lift any thing. I felt better in three days after putting the Belt
on, and in two months my power was entirely restored. Â» I was entirely cured," says
S. H.Austen, Mate Ship Hoeneme, San Francisco, Dae. 2, 1896. -r,>-
It makes men strong ; it removes the effects of early habits,
indiscretions* excesses, overwork and all abuse of the laws of
Nature. It helps Nature to mend and makes manhood perfect.
The failure of : medicine, of quacks, and even of other, so-
called, electric belts, is no argument against Dr. Sanden's Elec-
tric Belt. No other . treatment, ! no other belt, is in the V same
class : with it. Everything else may fail, and still Dr.^Sanden's
Belt will cure. It HAS cured thousands who had tried other
remedies without avail. 1 : i
No man who is weak will ; make ; the -right effort to regain
his power until he tries Dr. Sanden's -Electric Belt. A fair trial
of this great remedy will make it unnecessary to ever use any
other.; . . w /â¢ , ;
â "At the time. I bought your Belt I was so nervous and shaky that I could not do
any work without feeling.perfectly exhausted.. I had what is called Nervous Debility
from excessive drinking and sexual excesses. was practically on my last i gs. My
powers were all gone and I was a wreck. I had spent over $300 /or drugs without the
slightest benefit, when I got your Belt. ."I felt an improvement as soon as I applied it
and I continued improving until now.l feel as strong and well as I ever did in my life. -

York. He did not like this, the work con
tinuiner steadily from 6:30 o'clock p. v
until 12 a. m., and lenvins: him no time in
which to pursue his studies
One night about 8 o'clock there came
down an inquiry as to where the press
report was, and, going to the lesb
where Edison was at worK, Nltrht Man
ager Lsinhton was horritied to find there
j was nothing ready to go r.Dstair3, for tho
I r*aÂ«on that Edison had copied between
! 1500 ami 2000 words of stock and othei
j marked reports in a hand so small that he
I had only tilled a third of a page.
Lei<;nton laughed in spite of himself,
and savins, "Heavens, Tom; don't do
that again !" hastened to cut the copy up
into minute fragments and have it pre
pared in a more acceptable manner.
While this was occurrine Edison went
on leceiviiig, and the frequent trips of the
noisy dummy box, whicn communicated
wit:i the pressrooms on the next floor,
gave evidence that. he was no longer gaug
ing bis handwriting with an ultimate
view to putting the Lord's prayer on a 3
cent piece.
But all at once there wag a fÂ»reat noi'e,
and it was evident that Press Agent Wal
lace, a most profane man, was coming
down the stairs, swearing and shouting
as he came. Everybody grew excited ex^
cept Edison, who was perhaps dreaming
of the possibilities in some of the realms
of electrical enaeavor in which He has
since won renown.
But we did not have long to wait to
know the cause of Wallace's visit. Kick
ing open the door, ht> appeared to us, but
he was speechless. The last note of his
voice and the last remnant of a vocabu
lary of blasphemy which was famouj
throughout the city was gone. Standing
there with botn hands full of small, white
pages of paper, he could only beckon.
Leighton approached him. and tenderly
took the sheets of paper from him, to find
that Edison had made the radical change
from his first style of copy to simply put
tinÂ« o Â« word on each directly in
the center. He had furnished in this way
several hundred pages in a very few min
utes.
He was relieved from duty on the press
wire and put on another circuit, while the
much-tried Leighton devoted himself to
bringing Wallace back to a normal condi
tion, admitting of the use of his voice and
the flow of his usual output of profanity. â

WITH SENATOR WHITE'S ACTS
Tliey Say That He Is Too Lukewarm on the Funding
Bill Proposition and Has as Good
as Fallen Down.
He Told the Committee of Fifty
That It Was Not Dignified
â /â¢â¢â¢ to Filibuster
AND COKJURED OBSTACLES.
Prediction Made by W. W. Stow a
Year Before Senator White's Elec
tion and Its Fu filiment.
"If the Democratic party succeeds in
the next election Steve White will be
elected United States Senator."
This prediction, which was afterward ful
fil Â«d, was made by that prince of railroad
lobbyists, W. W. Stow, a year before
Stephen M. White was chosen by a Demo
cratic Legislature for the United States
fcenatorship.
It was observed by people who took
riore than a passing Interest in politics
i m notwithstanding Mr. White's public
#nd private declarations of hostility
against the aggression of the Southern
Pacific Company, every railroad heeler
and lobbyist, and every Democratic news-
paper notoriously known to be subsidized
by and friendly to that corporation, were
"whooping it up" for White ana "anti
monopoly." No Republican railroad
newspaper attacked him or threw any
obstacle in the way of his preferment.
This puzzled all but the small coterie of
politicians to whom the gentleman who
went'rishiug with Mr. Stow confided the
prediction of a year belore. But when
Mr. White after His election still spoke
and voted against Southern Pacific meth
ods the small coterie was puzzled aiso.
But certain events which have occurred
since then have made the action of the
railroad lobby more consistent than it was
supposed to be at first. The latest and
most startling of those events is the re
markable stand that trie Senator is mak
h g in the matter of the fi^ht against the
funding bill.
He has suddenly exhibited a lukewarm
ness that nas filled the opponents of the
bill with dismay. It ie wpJI known that
>fr. Huntington is making hurculean
efforts to have the bill rushed through be
fore the coming into power of President
elect McKmley and the new Congress. It
is aow or never with him, and for this
reason the opponents of the measure are
concentrating their lorces for the purpose
of preventing the passage of the bill.
The organized opposition in this State
ha? been crystallized into what is known
a- tÂ£e committee of fifty, with headquar
in ttds City. A mb-committee con
sisting of Mayor-elect Phelan, Georpe K.
}:ch anil James H. Barry waited noon
Senator White shortly after his arrival in
this City a few days aco, and had a tallc
â w.th him as to the bpst mode of procedure
to be adopted.
The committee Tvere^f the opinion that
Ijlrtjustering tactics should be re.-orted 10,
but. to their surprise. Senator White ei
presktfd the opinion that it was beneath
the dignity of a United Stales Senator to
.engage in that kind of warfare, and, be
sides that, he was sure that he would not
be able to secure the co-operation of a
. Btin^ciefnt number of Senators to carry out
the filibustering scheme, about twenty
Senators being required for that purpose.
He-was about sure that he could not get
.that many Senators.
This balking in the front rank before
the firing of a single shot; this piling up
of obstacles thai do not exist; this luke
warmness; this giving up the battle and
hanlins down the colors before the strik
ing ol a single blow, displeased several
members of the committee of fifty, and
they are now vividly remembering many
things that had become almost forgotten.
The flimsiness of the Senator's excnse is
the most suspicious fact in the whole af
fair. Men who know how things are done
in the United States Senate smile derisive-
ly when the excuse is stated, and declare
that three or four Senators are all that are
necessary to carry on a filibustering
scheme successfully.
They point to Senator Allen of Ne
braska, who held the floor for twenty-five
hours on one occasion, and to various
other filibusters who worked in relays,
and thus prevented the passage of obnox
ious measures. They point also to ttie
fact that Senator White is robust and vig
orous and in the prime of manhood, and
they therefore do not regard his excuse as
a iiooO one.
Ttey have no doubt that Senator Whi;e
will speak against and vote against the
bill. To do otherwise would be to com
mit political suicide. But more is re
quired in this crisis than a votp and a
speech, and that is thai kind of action
best calculated to prevent the bill reaching
a Tote during the present silting.
Many prominent Democrats are mur
muring over ttjis condition of things.
Others are declaring that the Senator is a
demagogue, wearing on** face to the peo
ple and another to Mr. Huntington. Tliey
cite as foundation for their suspicions the
unholy conspiracy entered into between
the Senator and Thomas V. Cator, wliere
by the Senator* was to perpetuate himself
in office at the expense of the people and
of the Democratic party, who would have
Cator saddled upon their shoulders as a
United States Senator.
Mr. Cator is suspected of being friendly
with the railroadâ that is, to the extent of
being willing to extend to it "fair treat
ment," and the people whose confidence
in Senator White is oozing from their
finger ends are somewhat agitated over
the factthat Senator White and Thomas
V. Cator were closeted together in the
Palace Hot*l for quite a lon â¢ period a day
or two before Senator White left for
Washington.
Hence Democratic sentiment is seething
and the noise of the bubbling thereof
makes the air hum with Democratic dis
content. . __ '
Senator White will be required in the
vernacular to get a lively move on to Him
self, au^l to filibuster in even a more
sprightly manner than Cuban sympa
thizers are doing in the United States.
Should he fail to do this there is a lar.-e
segment of the Democracy that will say to
him in the language of Oihello to the
erring Cassio: "I lovd thee once; but
never* more be officer of mill-".'

ON CIVIL SERVICE.
The Merchants' Association Invites
Opinion Regarding the
System.
The Merchants' Association is desirous
of having the public service throughout
the State of California based upon the
principles of civil service. The introduc
tion of the merit cystem In this City has al
ways been one of the first aims of the Mer
chants' Association. Information has been
received from a number of Senators and
Assemblymen in the coming Legislature
that point to the favorable consideration
of bills that will establish civil service in
the cities and counties throughout the
State.
The Merchants' Association has received
from the Secretary of State copies of tne
two bills that were introduced at the last
session of the Legislature, as well as otlier
information relating to civil service enact
ments. A careful examination of these
acts will be made and s:rong efforts will
be put forth to secure the passage by the
Legislature of a bill containing the most
improved features of civil service as
adopted by other States in the Union.
The Merchants' Association would like
to receive suggestions from the public
upon this subject, and is willing to co-op
erate with other organizations with a view
of presenting the strongest possible influ
ence in favor of a civil service enactment
by the Legislature about to convene.
UNEMPLOYED PRINTERS

THEY SANG LIKE BIRDS
Kindergarten Children Gathered
About the Christmas
Trees.
There They Mad? Mirry With Songs,
Gam;s and Divers P easing
Exercises Yesterday.
Hundreds of little kindergartners held
their merry Christmas festivals in this
City yesterday. They were provided with
the evergreen and ever-joyous tree and
each small tot found a present crowing
upon the fruitful boughs.
The Pioneer Kindergarten Society at
Golden Gate Hall entertained the children
I of the Silver Star School, 806 Sansome
street, the Sutro Mail Dock School, 218
Brannan street, and the Adler school, Sec
ond and Fo'sora streets. They were under
the supervision of their respective prin
cipals, Miss Elizabeth Wainwri -ht, Miss
Marie Schultze and Miss A. L. Manning,
who put them through their kindergarten
training with grace and precision. When
it is remembered that the youngsters
are all under 5 years of age and of all na
tionalities and colors, it can be seen how
difficult was the task.
The Occidental Kindergarten, located at
214 Second street, held its Christmas fes
tival at Union Square Hall yesterday
afternoon. The children, 100 in number,
were brought to the hall by the principal.
Miss M. Bullock, assisted by the teachers,
! Miss Apne- Noonan and Miss Claire
j Meyer. On the plat:orm a great tree had
been placed, illuminated with incandes-
I cent lamps and loaded with presents. For
j every little girl there was a doll dressed
by the young ladies of the Girls' High
School and lor the boys there were bags of
toys. Candies and cookies completed the
generous treat. Guido Alnrto, in flowing
wig ami arctic furs, was the Santa Claas
who presided over the festivities.
The children rendered the following
programme:
March and Ring Song; song, "Merry, Happy
Little Children"; games, Trie Spider mid the
Flies; The Seasons; The Rainbow; Dancing;
Presentation song: games, The Chickadees;
Washing and Ironing; Musical Johnny; Na
tional game; Christmas song.
The exercises of the little folks were
very entertaining and reflect much credit
apon the ladies who give their time and
care to these free schools. These institu
tions are all maintained by the voluntary
donations of charitably disposed person;,
and while many give liberally, the sum
total subscribed is small, and "the kinder
garten* are seeing hard times," as one of
the ladies interested expressed it yester
day. In many cases the pupils are
clothed as well hs trained, nnd this entails
extra labor upon tl\e noble women who
are a) the head of the institutions.
They Loved Mrs. Cooper.
A committee of the students of the uolden
Gate Kindergarten Training school drafted
and read to the class on Friday an eloquent
memorial to the late Sarah B. Cooper and her
daughter, Harriet Cooper. The memorial con
cludes:
And in the days of discouragement, such as wo
have Known by experienca will come to us In this
Held of labor, we leel that In their example we

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
MISS JULIA CROCKER
WILL SOON WED
Her Engagement to Samuel
G. Buckbee Is
Announced.
The Betrothal Made Public Upon
I the. Lady's Return From
Europe.
A Marriage That Is the Happy
Sequel to Long Years of
Friendship
Yesterday was announced the first im
portant engagement of the winter, that of
Misa. Julia Crocker, daughter of Mrs.
Clark W Crocker, and Samuel G. Buck
bee, a popular young business man and
society beau.
On Friday evening Miss Crocker re
turned with her sister, Mrs. Fred Green,
from an extended European trip, and on
Saturday morning her many young
friends were apprised of Uer return to
gether with the announcement of her
forthcoming marriage.
Miss Julia Crocker, since her debut
some throe seasons ago at a fancy dress
ball, which marks an epoch in local so
ciety, has been a much-sought-after belle.
Her name wds down on the receiving
list at all tne swell teas and "at homes, :>
and no function was considered complete
without her presence.
Last spring Miss Crocker, in company
with Mrs. Requa and her daughter. Mrs.
Captain Long, then Miss Amy Requa,
spent the season in the East, and received
considerable attention at all the fashion
able watering places. She returned in
time to be present at the wedding of her
sister, Fanny Crocker, and Mr. McCreery,
and shortly after left for an extended
European visit.
Samuel G. Buckbee, the fortunate young
man, is a prominent figure in ti.is City,
both socially a:id in commercial life:
He is a member of the firm of fehainwald,
Buckbee <fe Co. Mr. Buckbee is a mem
ber of the Pacific Union Club.
The announcement of the engagement
of the young couple came rather as a
surprise to their many friends. A warm
friendship was known to exist between
the young people, but no deeper feeling
was ever suspected.
The bride-to-De is a dainty brunette
with pretty nut-brown hair framing a
spirituelle face, in which sparkle a pair of
mischievous blue eyes. She is of medium
heu'ht and possesses a slight, girlish
ficure. She dresses with exquisite taste,
her gowns always being noted for their
rich simplicity.
Miss Crocker â¢ â  ' Ser mother are now
occupying their Â«W >me at 2010 Pacific
avenue. Mrs. ( Oi â  has just had the
home entirely rui. iua highly artistic
and original manner.
No date for the wedding has yet been
tixeJ, or for that matter even thought of,
though it is probable the marriage will be
one of the mnctions of the early new
year.
Roses and violets and rare exotics were
fairly showered upon the charming young
fiancee yesterday as tokens of her many
friends' heartiest congratulations.
A four-in-hand coaching party was
given yesterday by Mr. and Mrs. Henry
J. Crocker in honor of the betrothal of
Mr. Crocker's youngest sister. Miss Julia
Crocker, to Samuel G. Buckbee of this
City. The coach and iour were Mr.
Crocker's blue-ribbon winners at the re
cent horse show. Among those in the
pariy were Miss Julia Crocker, Samuel G.
Buckbee, Miss Owens and Mr. and Mrs.
Henry J. Crocker. The drive included a
tour of the park and a visit to In o 'leside.
CROCKER FAMILY HAPPY.
The Engagement, a Birth and the
Return of Relatives Occur
All at Once.
The Crocker family seems to have un
consciously concentrated upon this week
for the celebration of some important
social hapDenings.
Miss Florence Ives, a younger sister of
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker, will return to
morrow evening to her home in this City
after an absence of seven months spent in
a tour of Europe and in a visit with rela
tives in the East.
On Friday night Miss Julia Crocker and
her mother returned from an extended
visit in the East. Yesterday the very
intimate friends of the family beard the
first announcement 01 Miss Julia Crocker's
engagement to Samuel G. Buck bee of San
Francisco while a coaching party was
given by Henry J. Crocker in honor of the
betrothal.
Last night there was still another nota
ble event in the Crocker family. A daugh
ter was born to the wife of William
Crocker.
CHARGED WITH PERJURY
Harry K. Wilkins, Clerk fop Alleged
Half-Interest Swindlers., Ar
rested I.;i-.t Night.
Harry K. Wilkins, 27 years of age, was
arrested on Eddy street, near Market, last
night by Detectives Dillon and Crockett
and booked at the City Prison on the
charge of perjury.
Wilkins was a clerk in the office of
C. W. yon Tiedeman, Lincoln Carr and
Guy S. Whitcomb, the alleged half-inter
est swindlers, at 959-961 Market street,
when on March (J, 1894, Mrs. Harriet P.
Christy's name was forged to a deed in
favor of George C. Platt for a block of land
in the Richmond District and acknowl
edged before Lee D. Craig, notary public.
In the deed, when so acknowledged, the
consideration was $320, but when it wont
on record it bad been increased to $32,000.
A mortfjace from Pratt to Alonzo Tiiayer
for $58,000 was also made out and recorded.
At the trial in Judge Belcher's court
Wilkins identified the photograph of Mrs.
Sarah K. Owen Spencer at that of Mrs.
Chmty and said he had several times
called at the house, 208 Powell street,
with messages and knew her and her
husband well. In this it is alleged he
committed perjury and he was indicted by
t tie Grand Jury on April 10. Since then
tiie detectives have been, looking for him.
NEW ARMY RIFLES
Experiments Being Made With a Mush-
rooming Bullet.
Attention is drawn by General Flagler,
U. S. A., chief of ordnance, in his annual
report, to the questions tnat have arisen
regarding the "stopping power" of the
small-caliber bullet u^ed in the new army
rifle. The iorce of the bullet is admitted
to be t rriric and the accuracy of the new
gun admirable, but the size of the bullet
is claimed to be too small to do as danger
ous work as the old 45-caliber bullet. The
velocities obtained by the new army and
navy pieces with the smokeless powder
now used are so high that when a bullet
hits a man it makes a clean, round hole
and does slight injury in many instances
unless some vital part is struck. Bones
are pierced as though drilled by a gimlet,
wnereas severe fractures would follow
from a bullet of the old caliber.
The medical men having demonstrated
that a small bullet, no matter with what
velocity driven, would not be so effective
as one larger, the army experts have re
cently turned their attention to devising
some means by winch the bullet will cut a
more .ragged wound and thus cause more
serious injury. General Flagler has been
considering a proposition to ad^pt a soti
nose or mushrooming bullet, wlnsh wouid
spread out wnen it struck an animate
object, and thus inflict a more dangerous
wound than the 1 arJer bullet of the same
caliber and weight. Recently experi
ments have been conducted with this
bullet at the Frankiord Arsenal, but the
results were not as satisfactory as ex
pected, and unless some improvements
are made in the bullet the army will re
tain the present hard one for its rifle.
Tue experiments proved that the mush
rooming effect of the soft-nose bullet is
offset by the so-called explosive effect of
the :iard-pointed bullet at short ranges.
The soft-nose bullet was inferior in accu
racy, and especially inferior in its ability
to "penetrate hard substances used for de
fensive purposes, making it useless to
reach troops- under cover that would b â¢
dislodged by the present bullet. As a re
sult of the experiments trie War Depart
ment will probably retain the present
hard bullet and depend upon its putting
men out of action it it does not kill them
outright.
About 12,000 magazine rifles have been
made for the army and 8000 carbines fur
the cavalry, exclusive of 4u4 cadet rifles.
The daily output of tue Springfield
armory is now 120 r.fl^s or carbines, and
as they are being made for the Govern
ment in the proportion ot rive carbines to
one rifle, tiie sliops will be run on carbines
alone during two months in each liscal
year. The shops, however, are capable
of an output of 200 rifles to-day, and in an
emergency irom 300 to 350 rifles could be
delivered to Uie army every day in a
week. Tue army having recently been
completely furnished, boih cavalry aim
infantry, with a new small arm, a reserve
supply of guns is now being made. The
navy is receiving its allotment of ihe new
rifle at the rat- of 100 a day, the first de
liveries being sent to the new cruiser
Brooklyn and the monitor Puritan, which
poes in commission thvs month at
Brooklyn.
General FJagler calls attention to the
vaiue of the Crozier 10-ir.ch wire gun.
which hns been completed and tested
lately. This gun was turned over to tin

that the general programme adopted for

NEW TO-DAY.
DOCTOR SWEANY,
Whose reputation is established by ten years of successful
practice at 737 Market street, San Francisco.
A Guarantee of Skill and Ability in the
Treatment 01 Patients.
. Ten years of successful practice in this city has stamped
him as the master of medicine and surgery. Medical institutes
have risen and fallen. Specialists have come and gone. Others
will come and go the same as those before them, leaving their
patients poorer and uncured, but Dr. Sweany, through the
confidence of an appreciative people, through the great de-
mands from the sick and afflicted for his professional services,
and through his unparalleled success in curing disease, has
built up an immense and extensive practice, which has sub-
stantially and permanently established him in this city.
In seeking the services of Dr. Sweany you place yourself
under the care of a highly educated physician, a physician
whose ambition is to excel, whose whole life is devoted to the
advancement of the science of medicine and the relief of suf-
fering humanity. He has no single remedy which he deals out
as a common cure-all, nor any mechanical contrivance which
he heralds to the world as a remedy for all ills. His medical
education condemns such methods. His lofty aspirations and
honesty in practice place such modern Impositions back in
the days of witchcraft and quackery, where they Justly belong.
Dr. Sweany is a great student as well as a doctor. Through
constant study and deep research he is always abreast of the
times. There is 'no new discovery in medicine, no new appar-
atus to assist the physician in treating disease, but what is at
his command as soon as science proves it to be of worth and
benefit. Every case that he undertakes tcÂ£ cure is treated sci-
entifically with such remedies and such means as in his judg-
ment particular case requires in order to effect a speedy
and permanent cure. He has no experiments to make in treat-
ing disease, for . he is thoroughly educated and prepared
through experience already gained to accomplish his work in
the field of medicine. He has given ; special attention to all
classes and kinds of nervous and private diseases of both men
and women, and has restored to health many after other
methods of treatment and other doctors of ability failed.
Doctor Sweany gives particular attention to

gence, dissipation, over study, menial or business worry, etc.

treated private disease. SYMPTOMS: Languid, tired feelings;
lack of energy ; discontentment; gloomy forebodings ; palpita-
tion of heart; swrllingof feet or hands or puffiness of face bad

and debility of the nerves, brain, heart and muscles, rendering 'â¢
one unfit for business, study or enjoyment of life. If not cured
it usually ends in suicide, insanity or premature death. .
If you are a sufferer from nervous debility or failing
strength you should lose no time, but should at once consult
this eminent specialist. He can and will restore you to health.
He will by his treatment endow every organ of the body with
new life and cause them to perform their functions properly.
Mental brightness, manly vigor and muscular strength will re-
I turn, and you can then say to all the world, "I am a man," and
I there will be no one who can gainsay your assertion.

The soil and climate of this portion of the State
are especially suited to almond culture and many
hundreds of acres of this nut are now in full bear-
ing: among the great properties which have trans-
formed this section of the State the most Import-
ant Is that of the Haich-Armstrong Co., called
the sierra Vlita ranch: its pos-essions consists
of 1016 acres: of this great tract 500 acres are
devoted to almonds: one ton to the acre Is a fair
crop; the hlerra Vina will; average eveu better
than this; -as the nuts bring at least 8 cents per
pound it is evident a goo I orchard should bring lv
$160 per acre per year; these almonds are allot the
soft or paper-shell varieties and for these there Is
always a good marite : besides the almonds there
a: hundreds of .acres planted in peaches, figs,

In Lavenderâ S. J., City. "Laid up in laven
der" was an expression in ancient times to
designate that an article was in pawn. It was
applied to persons who were in hiding. In the
Harlcian Miscellany there is a writing by
Greene, from which the Hollowing quotation is
taken :
But the poore gentleman paies so deere for the
lavender it is lai.i up In tutu if it has been lone at
Ihe hrok.T's house he seems to buy his apparul
twee.
The term has nlgo been applied to the care
ful putting away of CiOthes in lavender to keep
the moths away. An Old author says: "And
II blHi-k Batten of his own to ro before her in,
winch lor the more bwcetuing lies in lav

Day of Bestâ W. N. G., Oakland, Cal. The
following is the law of the State of California
on the subject of a day of rest:
Kvery person employed In any occupation of
labor shall b* entitled to one day's rest therefrom
Iti seven: and it shall be unlawful for any em
ployer of lab?r to cam- his employe* or any of
them to worx more thaa six days In seven: pro
vided, however, that the provisions cf this sect On
stull nn t apply 10 any case of emergency.
For the purpoie of this act the term day s rest
shall apply to all cases, whether the employe is
ensHÃf-u by the da , weeK, month or year, or
whether the work performed is dove in the day or
night time.
This act was approved February 27. 1893,
and went into effect thirty days after its pas
sage. The journeymen bakers attempted to
enforce it, but it was not sustained.
The Lotus Eatersâ B. 8., Oakland, Cal.
Homer, the blind old man of Scio's rocky isle,
describes the lotus eaters as a people on the
northern coast oi Africa who wfcre visited by
Ulysses in his wanderings, and who en
deavored to detain his companions by- eiving
them the lotus to pat. It was asserted that
whoever ate of the fruit of tha lotus wished,
never agdni, that Is if he was a stringer, to de
part to see tiis native country. This poetical
idea wa< known to the Arabs of old, who
called it the fruit of destiny which is to be
eaten i.i Paradise, and it was this Idea that
Tennyson wrousjnt in his poem "The Lotus
Eaters." The lotus produces fruit in grest
abundance. Itisadrupeof the size of a wild
plum, wiih .an almost globose kernel. The
fruit is somewhat farinaceous, and has a
pleasant, sweetish, mucilaginous tast-_\ It has
from earliest times served as food to the in
hftbimnts of the northern part ol Africa,
where it is still the principal food of the poor.
Alimonyâ H. C, City. In the State of Cali'
fornia, a Superior Court has the right in a di
vorce case to grmt a wife alimony for life.
The law on the subject is as follows:
Where a divorce is granted fa- the offense of a
husband, the court may compel him to provide
forthe maintenance of the children of th â  mar
na.e and to make s ich suitable allowanci; to the
wife fo- her suppor;, during her lif: or for a
shorter period, as ihe court, may deem Juki, having
re, id 10 the circumstances of Ihe parties respec
tively, and the court mar from lime to time
modify its order In these respects.
: Generally, in the United -States,* alimony is
the money which a court requires a husband '
in a divorce, case to pay periodically to the 1
wife for her support. If the w;f â¢ obtains the
divorce the court will include in the decree I
directions for the payment of alimony 10 her |
during the rest of her life. As the man, when
he married the woman, agreed â¢ to support her
he cannot, through deliberate wiong ou his
part, get rid of the obligation. -<i ,- --
The Confederacyâ N. 8., Haywards, Cal.
Tne Southern Confederacy was officially recog i
nized by Great Britain. ! James G. Blame, in
â¢'Twenty Years in Congress," says :
Until then (the breaking out of hostilities) the
â United Mates was the only organized government'
on our soil known to Kncland, and with It she had
maintain*. 1 1 commercial and political relations that
had grown closer and more fri*-n ly. every year.
Ihe vital element of that Kovernmetn was union.
But the separatiou of the States was mure than
the dissolution of - the Union. For. treating with
all due respect the conviction of the Southern
States as 10 the violation of their constitutional
rights, no fair-minded man can deny tnat He cen
tral'idea of the secession movement was the es
tablishment of a great slav<>-holrilne empire around
the Gull of .Mexico. â¢ * -*. When English rates
men were called upon to'aeal with such a crisis
the Unit d : â¢ tÃtes â  had a rignr to expect, it not ac
tive sympathy, at least that neutrality which
would confine ii'sclf within the strict limit of con
stitutioual obligation, and would not withhold
friend y wishes lor the preservation ot tho Uulon.
Charles Francis Adams was sent by President
Lincoln as Minister to Great Britain with in
structions to explain to the British Govern
ment the condition of affairs in ; the .United
States, more especially tnat : foreign poweis
might not, ; under a misapprehension,* give
naiional aid to the States in rebellion. I The
British Government was aware of Mr. Adams'
mission before his departure for England. > On
the day of his arrival: in. England belligerent
rights were accorded to the Confederacy by a
proclamation , issued by the Queen of : Great
Britain recognizing the existence of war be
tween the United States and the Confederate
Stales and the right of each to exercise bellig
erent powers on the ocean, but not recoen iz
ingthe national independence of the latter
and enjoining the neutrality of her own sub
jects. . - 'â¢â â¢..â¢â â -â¢'â â â¢: -â

IN THE DRAW
Why a Tunnel Is Wanted
Under the Oakland
Harbor.
Beard of Trade and Merchants'
Exchange Unite in Work
in? for It.
la Foggy Weather It Would B3 a
Safeguard Agjin-t Narrow-
Gauge Accidents.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, Dec. 9. |
The need of but one bridge across the
estuary was clearly demonstrated to-day
when the bark Les Adelphes stuck'in the
draw and had to be towed back from the
norih channel at Webster-street bridge
ajid be pulled through the south channel.
This caused a delay of over half an hour
on a failing tide and delayed the narrow
gauge train for one trip.
During November an average of eleven
vessels a day passed through the draw,
and yesterday seventeen passed, while to
day twenty went through.
k The Board of Trade has decided that the
'most serviceable method of disposing of
the estuary is by a tunnel, which would
dispense with the necessity of 'the new
steel bridge that is now being planned by
wie railroad in conjunction witu the War
Department and the Supervisors.
At Ja^t night's meeting of the Board of
Trade a resolution was passed that a
petition be circulated to have the South
ern Pacific build a tunnel under the !

In foggy weather the value of a t'.innel
is very manifest. Last night the engineer
uf the narrow-gauge train did no-t see the
signal, but he stopped the train about a
block from (he bridge. Ii was sta;ed in a
report of the affair to-day that the train
crushed through the gates and nearly ran
info t c ratnary. There are no gates to
crash through and the bridge was closed,
so that had the train not stopped there
would have been no danger.

TRAP OVER A DUNGEON
And a Policeman Under the
Trap to Catch Failing
Rcbbers
Alameda's City Treasurer Devises a
Scheme Which H s All the
Merit of Or sinality.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 19.â The pres
ence ot thieves and burglars in the city
has caused some people to worry about
the cash iv the City Treasurer's safe. At
present he is prepared for a hold-up with
an electric alarm which he can set off with
his foot if his hands were in the air.
George J. Foster has conceived a novel
idea which he is anxious to have the
Board ol Trustees adopt for the prot ction
of the vault and capture of any burglar
who should attempt to make a raid upon
the treasurer. As the office is directly
aoove the police- station, Mr. Foster be
lieves that a trap dooi in front of tbe
Treasurer's counter could be so arranged
as to enable Mr. Wheeler, the treasurer,
to drop the hurglar downstair?, where he
would find himself in prison with an
officer on guard. This nvght astonish
both tbe would-be robber and officer, but
would certainly relieve Mr. Wheeler of
any danger of & deficit for hia bondsmen
to stand good for.
"Now, is not that a feasible scheme?"
asked Mr. Foster to-day. "You see,
when Mr. Wheeler steps on a button to
alarm the officers below he could with the
same movement send his antagonist into
the presence of the officer. He would be
too surprised to offer any resistance,
I hence hecou d easily be handenffed."
AlHineda Police May Ride Free.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 10 âThe new
rule of ti.e Alameda, Oakland and Pied

been rescinded so far as it applies to this
city's police officers and Officer Curtis of
Oakland. This seems to be a discrimina
tion in fnvor of this city.
Early in the week the company posted a
notice that all officers not on duty and in
foil uniform would be required to pay
their fare. To the public this would only
seem U be the proper thinp, but the Chief
of Police here did not look upon the new
order with any degree of pleasure. When
he made application to the company the
modification was made in lavor of his
men. No application has been made by
the Oakland officers for a rescinding of
tbe order on their territory.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
TRREE YOUNG MEN
STEAL A RANCH
Found It Untenanted, Moved
in and Refuse to
Vacate.
The McCoys Return to Their
Home in Redwood Canyon,
but Cannot Enter.
A Trio of Squatters Take Advantage
of a GcoJ House Furnished
by O-hers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Dec. 19. j
Three bold young fellows have stolen a
big ranch in Redwood Canyon. They live
in the house, feed their horses on the pas
ture land and makf good use of the black
smith-shop.
The man who has asked the assistance
of ,the Constable and Sheriff to oust the
intruders in vain Is James McCoy, who
now resides near Haywards. He has
finally decided to place the matter in the
bands of United States Marshal Baldwin.
The McCoy ranch is one of the best
known in Redwood Canyon. It has been
the cause of much litigation, and for years
there was a dispute as to its ownership,
but the McCoys lived on it till recently,
when they moved to Haywards, Intend
ing to return witn the approach of sum
mer. The ranch Has not been very profit
able during the past year and the family
desired to move away for a time and run
an express business. One of toe McCoys
went, to the ranchhouse a few days ago
and found three young fellows in posses
sion.
"They absolutely refused to acknowledge
my right to enter our own house," sai<i
McCoy yesterday. "I told them who I
was, but they said they knew better and
would not move until put out by the
Sheriff. They told me that they found
the place all ready for Deople to live in
and they proposed to stay. They even
hinted that there was still a doubt as to
its ownership and that I tnitrht have
trouble in proving; my right to the place,
and that so long as its title is disputed
they might as well live there as let the
place remain idle.
"They have a very comfortable place,
but I could not get them to tell- their
names, so I ao not know who my guests
are. They are evidently very bright fel
lows and I have a job to get rid of them.
'"I have applied to Constable Gallet, but
be says he can do nothing without an or
der of court now that the youna fellows
are in possession, and the Sheriff has told
mo the same thing. I am now going to
/.pply to Marshal Baldwin, as I consider
the fellows are sauatiers."
The case is a very interesting one. and
before the McCoys can oust the interlopers
they will have to prove their ownership.
This may cause them much trouble, and
the squatters will meanwhile enjoy life at
their pre-empted ranch. The place con
sists of several acres of land, a ranch
house, barns and a blacksmith-shop.
4MB - Was a Batcher's Bunt.
OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 19.â The boat

stolen fiom him. Messrs. Richards and
Harmon, who, it had been feared, had
lost their lives while out in the fog, have

Kindergarten Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 19. â About
twenty kindergarten teachers from around
the bay met State Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction Black and his deputy, Mr.
Seamens, to-day, and considered a pro
posed law requiring such teachers to pos
sess credentials of equal grade to teachers
in the grammar schools, and also to have
special training in the work. The senti
ment was favorable to such a law.
ANOTHER BONUS ASKED
This Time a Cycling Company
Would Like to Be Boomed
Free.
As Other Efforts of a Like Nature
Have Proved Abortive This May
Fare No B:tter.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 19. J
A cycle manufacturing company from
tbe East has written to* the Board of Trade
asking what Oakland will give in the way
of bonus, site, etc., if said company will
establish a branch here. Such applica
tions are now regarded as being in the
nature of seeking lree nct.riety, and to
such an extent has this been carried that
they are no longer regarded as being made
in good faith.
"This company may be in earnest and
they may no f ," said a prominent member
ol the Merchants' Exchange to-day, "but
if they think that they are going tcfuse us
a-s free advertising mediums they have
made a mistake. Some time ago a gun
agent came here and made all kinds of
pronjises. The Mayor called a meeting of
representative merchants at the council
chamber and for a few weeks everybody
was talking of the new gun. Ii was a
splendid lree advertisement for tbe gun
and that was the end of it.
"The next, agent to come here was the
representative of a glass firm who were
anxious to locate on this coast. He did
very well. He bad the Oakland merchants,
the Livermore League of Progress and the
Martinez people all interested nt once and
his firm was well boomed. Then came a
cycle man and the same resuli followed â
nothing was dene. Now comes another
message of the same nature.
â¢'lf these people find they can establish
these industries on the coast they will
come, and if they cannot succeed the gift
of a piece of land will not bring them.
This bonus proposition is a good one, but
we 'need to make sure that we get the
value for our money." .
Soule* Divorced.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 19.â Judge Og
den to-day grunted the prayer of Ella
Bacon Soule fora divorce from Professor
Frank Soule, the head of the civil engin

this will bring the two wings together for
effective work in the spring campaign.
A STEEILE-JACK
He Has ; Been in the Climbing Business
for Many Years.
The great success of the Trafalgar day
celebration this year was largely due to
the striking and appropriate decoration of
the Nelson monument in Trafalgar
sqnare. The plucky steeple-jack twining
the mighty wreath round the column was
witnessed by thousands and for many
days the achievement was the principal
subject of ponversation throughout Lon
don if not throughout the country. The
result was that, although over ninety
years have passed since Nelson breathed
bis last on the Victory, the anni
sary of the day on which the
oattle oi Trafalgar was fought and won
lias never been celebrated with so much
popular enthusiasm as was the case this
year.
W. E. Harrison, the steeple-jack who so
successfully carried out the work of de
coration, has been for several years
famous as a darine and reliable member
of his risky profession. He is a Sheffield
man by birth, and his father was a
steeple- jack uetore him. Soon alter he was
10 years of age Mr. Harrison used to go
with bis father to the top of the highest
chimneys, urged not by any necessity, but
by the mere spirit of adventure. His
parents did not intend him to be a steeple
jack, however.
. He vas sent to a good school, and when
he was 15 his father was arranging for his
further education so that he might qualify
lor a situation in some business tirm.when
he took his future into his own hands.
He appealed to his parents to be allowed
to begin work as a steeple-jack. In re
sponse to his repealed requests he was
given a trial, ami he has been at the work
ever since. He is now 38 years of age.
His lather died in 1887, and since then
he has carried on the business and made
his name famous in many parts of the
country.
Although the decoration of the Nelson'
monument is perhaps the most interest
ing work he iuis done it is by no means
the most dangerous. Some of his feats in
examining insecure chimneys and the
like are enough to make the blood of the
ordinary man turn cold. Personally Mr.
Harrison belongs to the best ty\>e of the
Yorkshire gentleman and business man.
He has only had one serious accident, but
ibis might easily have proved fata!. In
repairing a chimney he fell a distance of
seventy feet and escaped without perma
nent injury by a miracle. A man who
fell at the same time, although a less dis
tance, was killed on the spot.
LIND'S AMERICAN DEBUT.
Never Has a I'liinu- I 'onna So Charmed
Her Audience.
Hon.. A. Oakey Hall writes of "When
Jenny Lind Sang in Castle Garden," for
tho Ladies' Home Journal â the first of a
series of "Great Personal^ Event3 #> de
scribed by eyewitnesses for that maga
zine. Of her first appearance â her first
song â in America, and the unprecedented
enthusiasm she aroused, Mr. Hail enter
tainingly and graphically writes: "Haric
to the voice! It is beginning the first bar
of 'Casta Diva,' irorn 'Norma.' The silence
in the audience is intense. She has sung
only a lew bars of the matchless cavatina
before all music lovers recognize thai
while other artists have endeavored to
mnke something outof 'Casta Diva' Jenny
Lind is embodying it. There is the grad
ual growth of sostenuto, then rhythmic
undulating, now high notes, as triumph*
of pure expression and not of merely
physical marvel and finally bird-like
ecstasy of trills. Before her is an abyss of
bust), into which she pours that voice, the
very soul of song.
"She ceases and timidlyâ not proudly â
Dows, and is retiring wnen the audience,
not content with making the usual Amer
ican demand for an encore, arises en
masse and repeats with fourfold energy
and spirit the almost frantic demonstra
tion with wh'ch it greeted Jenny Lind
upon her entrance. Tbe audience is liter
ally wild. . Never had a singer so stirred
up listeners before. The thunderous ap
plause keeps up for many minutes, until
the audience seems exhausted. * * *
Trained musicians are praising the flu
er.cy and precision of Jenny's chromatic
scales. One is emphasizing what he terms
'the inspired vitality of Lind's voice,' and
the unanimous verdict seems to be thai
never before were heard in concert-room
sweeter tones. Even white-haired vet
erans, who have listened to Mali bran
and tier sister, Viardot, or to Grisi, or to
Adelaide Keruble, all pronounce Jenny
Lind the superior of those oldtime sodg
angels in realms consecrated by Saint
Cotelia."

"PRISON PRODUCTS
FOR PRISON USE"
To Confine Convict Labor
to State Institu
tions.
Bills and Amendments to the
Codes for Regulating Felon
Competition.
Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation Moves in an Important
Matter.
and Producers'
sceiation is exerting itself in the important
matter of preventing ruinous competition
between free &nd prison labor. Yesterday
the following letter was sent to Governor
Bodd:
San Francisco, Dec. 17, 1896.
Hon. James H. Sudd, Governor of California,
Sacramento, Cal.â Dear Sir: I hÃve the honor
lo present some facts to you on behalf of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association,
which in view of the coming session of tne
State Legislature no doubt will prove of in
terest to you.
Firstly, 1 would call your attention to the
constitutional amendment which will go Into
effect January 1, 1897, in the State of New
Yorlt and titled Constitutional provision
abolishing competitive labor iv prisons, peni
tentiaries and reformatories (constitution,
article 111). This provision you will see vir
tually abolishes convict competition wiih free
labor, with the exception tnat it allows the
urn' of convict labor. by the State and matters
projected by the several counties.
Secondlyâ lnclosed plea.se find a copy, of a
report made by Thomas J. Dowling, Commis
sioner of Prisons for the State of New York,
and one particular clause in his report I would
kindly call your attention to, and that is
where it refers to the principles that have
been carried out. in the Slate of New York and
also other States of tbe Union, and why the
State Board of Prison Directors of California
should endeavor to now compel the manu
facturers of the Slate of California to again
come iv competition with con vet labor, after
having proven to them the disastrous effects
which convict labor had upon our manufac
turers in San Francisco some years back is, to
say the least, somcwhr.t surprising to the offi
cers of this association. One thing must be
said, that the manufacture of goods in the
prisons necessitates the purchase of a consid
erable amount of machinery, involving the ex
penditure of hundreds of thousands of dollar*,
and while we are endeavoring to foster our
interests we hope that the officers of the differ
ent State institutions, more particularly the
Board of Prison Directors, will be patriotic
enough to endeavor lo employ prisoners so as
not to compel them to come in competition
with free skilled labor.
The manufacturing interests of Calitornia
amount to $156,000,000 invested capital, and
we leel confident that we voice the sentiment
of the mannfacturers of California when we
state that employment should be found for
convicts solely in the manufacture of jute
bags and the breaking of stone from quarries,
or else permit them to be employed on high
ways to better the roads of this Bta c. While
upon this subject I have the honor to submit
for your consideration a copy of the south
wick Dill, which is now in the House of Repre
sentatives and which this association is en
deavoring to have passed. From the testi
mony presented durlug the time that the
Southwick bill was in the hands of the com
mittee it hÂ»s been proven that 900 convicts in
the New York penitentiary were successfully
employed in the betterment ot roads. This
association fully appreciates the kind atten
tion that you have given their suggestions
Irom time to time, giving preference to the
manufacture of home products in the State
institution!), and we ieel that if we can pre
sent these facts and figures to you, tiiat you,
as tbe highest executive officer of the State,
will t;ive our appeal and the presentation of
facts by us citreiul consideration.
In concluding, I desire to submit to your at
tention the testimony of Mr. Pllsbury, super
intendent of the penitentiary on Blaekwell's
Island, New York. As to the importation of
convict goods in the State of California, we
have met with many difficulties, it is not the
interest of importers of convict-made goods to
spread thu information, and we have en
deavored ior the past year to get data, but we
have not been as successful as we expected.
I herewith also inclose copy of section to be
added to the Penal Code of California, and
also new section to Political Code, in reter
ence to convict-made goods, which have been
submitted to the Code Commissioners of Cali
fornia, and no doubt will be incorporated in
their report. Yours very truly,
Julian Sonntag, President.

manded a brigade in Davis' division, was
one of those men so slouchy in his appear
ance that a stranger would never have
picked him for an officer of high rank.
One day a raw recruit of his brigade who
had lost some books asked a veteran
where he might be able to find them. The
veteran saidthe only thief in the brigade
was Jim Morgan, who occupied a tent
near the blue flag. Thf recruit hastened
to Morgan's tent, shoved his head through
the flaps and asked :
"Does Jiru Morgan live, here?''
"My name is James Morgan," answered
the general.
"Then I want you to hand over those
books you stole from me!"
"I have none of your books, my dear
man."
"That's a lie," cried the soldier. "The
boys say you are the only thief in camp.
Turn out them books, or I'll grind your
carcass into apple sass!"
General Morgan appreciated the joke,
and laughed heartily, but when the re
cruit began pulling off his coat to make
good his threats, the officer informed him
of his relations to the brigade.

FORT BLUNDER.
It Was Built by Mistake on Canadian
Land and Thus Won Its Name.
General Miles has recently recom
mended the fortifying of a number of our
seaports and the enlargement of some of
the posts along our frontier. One of these
is Fort Montgomery that stands at the out
let of Lake Champlain. The mentioning
of this long- forgotten old fort recalls a
queer fact connected with its beginning
and long ago forgotten. In 1841 it was
decided to build a large post at the en
trance to Lake Champlain and worK was
begun on Fort Montgomery, as it wa3
called. After a good deal of work had been
done it was found that the walls of the
fort were over the lines dividing the United
States from Canada. Work wa-s stopped
and a survey made and part of the work
was torn down.
Later on it was ascertained that part of
the walls of the post were stiil over the
dividing line. An agreement was made
with the English Government which gave
to the United States that part built upon,
and the outline of the old fort was com
pleted, but as these mistakes had caused
so much trouble tbe post was nicknamed
"Fort Blunder." Work was stopped on
the old post at the breaking out of the late
war, and since that time it has been under
the charge of an ordnance sergeant. Soon
work win be resumed, and if the recom
mendatons of General Miles are carried
out the old poat will be converted into tbe
largest and most strongly armed poet in
tbe country, as it is the intention of tbe
general to have a large number of the
largest guns made by our ordnance de
partment to protect tbe entrance to the
lake, on which, a few miles below, is lo
catel Piattsburg Barrucks, one of the
most important posts of our Canadian
frontier. â Cincinnati Enquirer.

FITZGERALD SPRINGS A SURPRISE
ON THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC
He Files a Somewhat Sensational Demurrer to the
Railroad's Suit Pending in the United
States Circuit Court.
JURISDICTION OF JUDGE
M'KENNA IN DOUBT.
A Flank Attack Made on the
Legal Status of the
Corporation.
LEASES HELD EY IT CLAIMED
TO BE INVALID.
The Combinatioi Said He Is in Vio
lation of Both the State and
Federal Constitutions.
It was only n demurrer filed by Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald, in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday in the case
Oi the .Southern Pacific Company against
the Board of Kailroad Commissioners of
California. But in that document ques
tions are raised of the most vital impor
tance to the complainant.
The original suit was brought to enjoin
the Railroad Commission from enforcing
its schedule of freights reaucing grain
rates 8 per cent.
In th<Â» preliminary decision rendered by
Judce McKenna tliese grain rates were
declared to be unreasonable, and the
temporary injunction granted when the
Buit was instituted was ordered to con
tinue until the case was tried on its
merits.
It was generally anticipated that the
next step of the Railroad Commission
would be to make a thorough investiga
tion of the affairs of the complainant cor
poratiou before Judge McKenna, in order
to prove that the S per cent reduction in
grain rates was just and reasonable.
The filing of the demurrer yesterday
came as a complete surprise to all not in
the confidence of the Attorney-General.
The demurrer, in substance, denies that
there is any question of equity to be de
cided, but claims that the matter should
be iitipated only when any attempt is
made to enforce the oDjectiouable action
of the Commissioners.
It is claimed that the action of the com
mission is legislative and not subject to
review by any court; that any violation
of the rates fixed by the commission is a
criminal matter and not subject to re
straint by a court of equity.
It is denied that the complainant is a
railroad or that it is empowered to operate
any of the railroads mentioned in its bill
of complaint. It is further charged th:it
all the leases made to the Southern Pacific
. Company- are invalid, and that therefore
the complainant cannot legally concern
itself with the question how any of the
lessor roads would De affected by the
commission's action. Â»
The complainant is charged with being
an unlawful combination created in viola
lation of both the State and Federal con
stitutions. The fail text of this inter*
esting demurrer follows:
And now co-ne the defendants, by protesta
tion, and not confessing or acknowledging all
or any of the matters or things in the bill of
complaint, either as originally filed or as sub
sequently amended, to be true in.such manner
,an-J form as the sumc are herein set forth
demur to said bill, and for causes of demurrer
show:
I.
That it appears by the complainant's own
showing as by the said bill amended, that
complainant is notentitled to the relief prayed
for by the bill against the defendants, or to
aoy relief.
That said bill, as amended, shows no equity
and does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of complaint, or to entitle the said
complainant to any relief in equity. And
these defendants specify the particular
grounds oi the cause of demurrer as follows:
1. That it appears by the complainant's own
showing, by said bill as amended, that there
is no adequate remedy at law for any and ail
of the mutters and things set forth in said
bill as amended, to wit, the remedy of setting
and litigating any and all oi said matters
and things and by way of any defense to
any proceeding or proceedings which may be
brought to enforce the regulations of the
Board of Railroad Commissioners set forth
in said bill, or to enforce either of such reso
lutions, or any schedule or schedules made or
served in pursuance of said resolutions, or
either of them, or to enforce any rates of fare
or freights fixed by said board, or to any
proceeding or proceedings which may be
brought against said complainant by reason
of or ba?ed upon any matter or thing averred
in said bill, either as originally filed or
amended;
2 That it appears by the complainant's own
kew to-dat;

sary Medical Association, Buffalo, N. Y.
showing by said bill as amended that the de
fendants have no interest in the subject mat
ter of the suit for the following reasons, viz:
(a) Because the only function of tbe Board
of Railroad Commissioners of the State of Cali
fornia in relation to rates of charges for trans
portation companies, or fares or freights, or in
relation to any of the matters and thincs set
forth in the bill, cither as originally filed or
amended, is legislative in cnaracter and not
subject to review by any court;
(6) Because even if the function of said
board as to said matters and things referred to
in the preceding head of this demurrer were
judicial in character, it was exercistd after
notice and heating, and would be as conclu
sive us any other judicial action;
(c) Becuuse the 25 par cent resolution set
forth in smd bill has never taken effect or gone
into operation, for the reuson that no schedule
under or in pursuance of it has ever been
made or served, and consequently no part of
the reduction spoken of in f-aid 25 per cent
I resolution has ever taken effect, and because
the other resolution set forth in said bill, to
wit, the 8 per oÂ°nt or "grain rate" resolution,
although in effect by reason of the making
and i-ervice of n schedule by tbe said board, is
not to be enforced by said board, and tiie said
bonrd is not given any power or cnurged with
any duty to enforce the same or any part
thereof, or the rate or rates of charges or rates
of fure or freight fixed by said board , and is
not given any power or charged with any
duty to takv or cause to be taken any proceed
ing or proceedings lor the punishment of any
violation or violations thereof; but said board
has become functus oflii'io with respect to all
of ttiL- same, and all ot the same is, under the
| law, to be enforced and punished (if at all) by
! other officers of the State of California who
art 1 not, now before the court.
(</) Because under the constitution and the
lows of the State of California the observance
of rates of fare and freight established by said
Board of Railroad Commissioners is to be en
[ forced, and disobedience to the same pun
ished by criminal proceedings which are not
subject to be enjoined or restrained by a court
of equity.
3. That it appears by the complaint's own
showing by said bill, both as originally filed
and as amended, that the complainant is not a
railroad or transportation company at all,
and is not, by its character or otherwise, au
thorized or empowered to operate the rail
roads mentioned in said bill, or any of them,
or any railroad or transportation company in
the State of California, or in the State oi Ken
tucky or elsewhere, and the matters and
things for which the complainant seeks the pro
tection of the honorable court for tbe future
are outside its corporate powers and no! per
| mitted by its charter, and are ultra vires.
4. That it appears from the complainant's
own showing by said bill as amended that the
several corporations which are alleged to have
leased their respective roads to the complain
ant had no power to make said leases or any of
them, or in any way to lease their roads or
property to the complainant or to any person,
firm or corporation whatsoever, and the said
complainant bad no power or authority to
take or receive said leftses or any of them, and
that all of said leases are invalid and void and
are ultra vires with respect to all of said cor
porations, and passed no right, title or inter
est to the complainant and that complainant
cannot concern itself with the question how
any of said roads will be affected by any rate
or rates of fare or freight fixed by said Board
of Railroad Commissioners, and cannot have
the protection . f this houorable court for the
future operation of said system or of any of
said roads.
5. That it appears from the complainant's
own showing Dy ?aui hill as amended that the
aggregation or combination, of railroads men
tioned in the bill and the amendment thereto,
was at all the times mentioned in the said bill
and in said amendment, and is an unlawful
combination and in violation of the laws of
tbe State of Cnliloruia and of the United States
and contrary to public policy for the follow
ing reasons:
(a) Because it is in violation and contraven
tion of section 20 of Article XI I of the consti
tution of the State of California, wnich pro
vides that no railroad company or other com
mon carrier shall combine or make any con
tract witti any common carrier "by which
combination or contract the earnings of one
doing the carrying are to be shared by the
other not doing the carrying."
(b) Because it is in violation and contra
vention of the provisions of the act of Con
gress of the United States, of July 2, 1890,
entitled "An act to protect trade and com
merce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies," commonly called and known as
the "Anti-Trust Act."
(c) Because it is in violation and contra
vention of the rules and principles of the
common law, in relation to restraints of trade
and iv relation to monopolies.
(il) Because it is in reality and is substan
tially equivalent to a partnership of tbe cor
porations mentioned in said bill, and in said
amendment including the Central Pacific-
Railroad Company.
(c) Because it involved and involves an
attempted but unauthorized transfer and dele
gation to the complainant of the corporate
franchisee, powers and functions oi the other
corporations respectively mentioned in said
bill and nraendment.
(J) Because it involved and involves an
attempted but unauthorized transfer to the
complainant ot the Federal franchises of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company without the
consent of Congress.
6. That it appears from the complainant's
own showing by said bill as amended, tnat
the complainant is a corporation of another
State aud is not authorized to do business or
exercise any corporate function in the State of
California, except upon such terms ana condi
tions, and in obedience to such laws and in
compliance with such ruies and regulations as
the State of California chooses to enact, and
is in no position to complain of the provisions
of the constitution or the laws of the State of
California, or of anything done under or in
pursuance thereof by any board or officer of the
State, and especially not of the provision of
the constitution or the laws of the State which
were in existence before f.ie complainant com
menced to do business in the State, or was even
incorporated, or of anything done thereunder
by any board or officer of the State, of which
character are the provisions of tne constitu
tion and laws in relation to tbe Railroad Com
mission.
7. That it appears from the complainant's
own showing by said bill as amended that cer
tain of the lessor corporations mentioned in
the said billâ to-wit: the Oregon and Califor
nia Railway Company, and tne Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company of Arizona, and the
Southern Pacific Railroad- Company of New
Mexico â are corporations organized re
spectively outside the limits of the State of
California, and are for that reason subject to
the considerations stated in the preceding
heud of this demurrer.
8. That it appears from the complainant's
own showing by said bill a* amended that all
the lessor corporations mentioned in said bill,
except the Oregon and California Railroad
Company and the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company of Arizona and ttie Southern Pacific.
Railroad Company of New Mexico, "were or
ganized under the laws of the Sute of Califor
nia, and that therefore their charters have
always been and are subject to be at any time
repealed, altered or amended at tne pleasure
of the State of California, which Mate always
had and has the. power to in any way restrict
or modify the corporate power of taking tolls,
which is in substance and effect what the
things complained of by the complainant
amount to, and because the complainant, il
it took or nolds any rights or power whatever
under any of said leases, took aud must hold
them upon the same terms and conditions as
its lessors hold them.
9. That the showing in the said bill as
originally filed is insufficient because it deals
with complainant's so-called "Pacific system"
as a whole and does not show separately the
earnings and operating expenses of either that
part of the system whicu is in the State of
California or of each of the several constituent
or lessor corporations therein, both of which
matters are material to be shown
by the complainant becnuse, in the first
piaco, the validity ot the rates fixed
by the Board of Railroad Commissioners for
the transportation of freight or passengers
from one point in the State of California to
another point In said Stateâ in other words for
its domestic commerce or transportation â
ought not to be made to depend upon or be in
any way affected by transportation operations
wholly outside of said State, ana, because, in
tne second place the complainant ought not
to be allowed by any mere conventional ar
rangement of iis own to make the shippers oi
one part or section of the State contribute to
the payment of the operating expenses or
fixed charges of separate roads ruuning
through differei.t parts of the country, and
dealing with different sets of customers; and
that the showing in the amendment ami in
thÂ«_- bill as amended is insufficient because it
does not do away with the second ob.igation
just mentioned, that is to say if deals with
tnat part of the "system" which is within the
State of California as a whole, and does not
show separately the earnings or operating ex
penses in California of any of the several con
stituent or lessor companies therein.
10. Tiiat the showing in the bill ax amended
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
is insufficient, because the only matter really
involved is the validity of the grain rates fthe
25 per cent resolution never having taken
effect for reasons in this demurrer above set
forth), and there is no showing in the bill,
either as originally fl.eil or as amended as to
what relation, if any, the grain rates have or
will have to the earnings of the complainant
or what effect the reductions made by the said
board has to the grain rates, have or will have
upon the ability of complainant to pay the
operating expenses or fixed charges men
tioned in said bill, or in said complaint or
any part thereof, or upon its ability to pay
dividends to stockholders or upou the ability
of any of the constituent or lessor corpora
tions to pay its operating expenses or its fixed
charges or to pay dividends to stockholders,
it being entirely possible, and even probable,
that the grain rates were before said reduction
very much too high, and the rates for other
classes of freight very much too low; and also
because it does not appear whether the grain
reductions affect all of the constituent or
lessor companies or only some of them, and if
only some, how many and what ones.
11. That the showing in the bill as
amended Is insufficient, becanse it does hot
appear that all or any of the matters and

The Mercantile Library Auxiliary In
stall* Officers and Formulates
New Plang.
The Mercantile Library Auxiliary in
stalled its new officers last night in the
parlors of tbe hbiary bailding, on the cor
ner of Golden Gate and Van Ness ave
nues. The new officials of the auxiliary
are as follows :
President, Mrs. Frances B. Edgerton; first
vice-president, Mrs. Henry Gibbons; second
vice-president, Mrs. Mary Prag; third vice
president, Mrs. Lovetl White, fourth vice-pres
ident, Mrs. Ferdinand Vassault; recordiug sec
retary, Mrs. Robert Collier; corresponding

Thurlow McMullin; directors â Mrs. Montgom
ery Godley, Mrs. George J. Bucknall, Mrs.
Thomas P. Woodward, Miss Tesgie Semple,
Mrs. Eva Mitchell Cook and Mr*. Edward May.
The installation was preceded by a brief
business meeting, at which Mrs. Lovell
White, the retirine president, made a few
remarks on tbe flourishing condition of
the auxiliary and wished the new officers
pleasure in tbe performance of their duties.
She was followed by Mrs. Frances B.
Kdirerton in an inaugural speech.
After a musical programme the evening
was concluded with a social reception to
the new officers and members, and re
freshments were served in the library
parlors. The board of directors acted as
the reception committee.
The retiring orlicers are: Miss M. J.
iSnook, Miss Thompson, Mrs. Edward
Probert, Miss F. LÂ°nt, Miss Catlin and
Miss Sarah D. Hamlin. Others of the
former officers are included in different
capacities on the new board of directors
and executive officers.
A most successful year has just been
completed by the retiring administration.
Some $700 or $800 has been turned into
the library fund. This has been expended
chiefly for new books.
The auxiliary consists of about 100
members, who pay $1 a year in dues, and
do all they can a/a body and individnaUy
to increase the popularity of the lrbrarv.
Mrs. Edarerton, the new president, is
credited with being a most eifted woman,
and will undoubtedly add mucu to the
auxiliary influence.

A Kuyal Keaidenoe.
This City is famous the world over for
its many well-equipped rooming houses.
The Royal House, 126 Ellis street, is one
of these, which for rooming purposes is
unsurpassed in the State.
The annex, containing sixty-five rooms,
has just been opened. The entire build
ing ii thoroughly fire-proof; metallic lire
escapes have been placed in front and in
the rear.
The interior is well lighted by electricity
and well ventilated throughout.
The structure is provided with every
modern improvement. One of the leading
features of the Royal is an electric ele
vator, which runs from tne office floor. A |
first-class reading and ladies' parlor, con
taining all the daily papers, is much ap
preciated by the guests. In furnishing
the Royal House no expense has been
spared. The furnishings are new through
out, tbe carpets are all ot the finest vei
vets; the bedsteads, chiffoniers, mantels,
etc., are all of antique oak; many of the
rooms have mantels and tiling of Ten
nessee marble. F. L. Turpin, the genial
proprietor of tbe Royal House, has con
lerred a benefit on the public by giving;
superior accommodations at the most
moderate of rates. *

FAIRIES AND FUN
AT THE TIVOLI
The New Spectacle Makes
a Very Decided
Hit.
"Jack and the Beanst^k" With
Up-to-Date Jokes and
Effects.
Ferris Hartman Sings "If I Were
Only a King" Till His Encores
Are Exhausted.
"Jack and the Beanstalk," the Tivoli's
holiday spectacle, was welcomed last night
by a crowded and enthusiastic bouse. It
lasted till late, as pieces are apt to on
the oDening night, particularly when the
hearers insist on repeated encores, but not
a line of the dialogue or a bar of the
music was dull, and the audience stayed
till the end and evidently enjoyed them
selves till the finale.
Tne old fairy tale has kept to its original
lines about as much as fairytales gener
ally do in extravaganzas, but in the
Tivoli's "Jack and tbe Beanstalk,"
Oberon and Titania are at outs, just as
they are 111 "Midsummer Night's Dream,"
but their quarrel at the Tivoli is over
Jack, whom Titania befriends, with the
aid of Puck, who g yes Jack the magic
beans in exchange for the cow he could
not sell at market.
The financial troubles, which drove
Jack's mother to sell her cow have been
caused in the new "Jack and the Bean
stalk" by nulk supplied on credit for
years -to the King of Shreds and Patches,
who has a number ot engaging peculiar
ities, which include the wearing of a to
mato can for a crown and the systematic
addressing of his subjects as "My ob
jects." Ferris Hartman plays tne king in
Jus best style and the fun is fast and
furious whenever ho is on the stage.
The song which was encored till the
genial Ferris was forced to confess tnat he
did not know any more encores was "If
I Were Only a King," a song, by the way,
with which another genial comedian has

KELLY & LIEBES'
identified himself, but the words are Hart
man's own, and some of the local allusions
aroused thunders of applause, as, for in
stance:
If I were really a king,
I'd make It a law
That the prizefighter's jaw
should not. ue allowed its full swing;
1' I be quite sure of one thing:
He'd have no gun when lie entered the ring.
It was not the poetic art of "If I Were
Really a King" that the people applauded,
but the local bits with which it bristled.
Another piece of the Hartman repertoire
that gave great satisfaction was the duet
between the King and Jack's mother,
"Am I Rieht?"
Miss Josie Intropedi, late of the Vassar.
Quurtet, is very clever as the Queen of
Shreds and Patches, the elderly and jeal
ous wife, who helps her spouse to rule
"My objects."
Elviii Crox Seabrooke makes a dashing
and effective "Jack," and -William H.
West is thoroughly comical as "Jack's"
mother, the lady who cannot collect her
milk bill from the King. Rhys Thomas
makes the most of his part of the milk
man. 'Johanna, the Cow" (with dance-)
is one of tbe most-applauded characters in
the cast. Her four feet are owned by
Messrs. Maurice Darcy and Fred Kava
naugh, and considering that only tbeir
leet are visible, the unanimity of their
dancing is really remarkable.
John J. Raffael plays the part of Oberon
and sings a charming waltz song, "Dear
est, Mine Own," in his usual excellent
style. Miss Annie Suits, tbe Titania, lias
not very much voice, but she does a niucti
| applauded sonc and dance rot in the uiar
< ket scene. Master Jack Robertson as
[ Puck almost shares applause with Ferria
Hartman. The little fellow is evidently
anotuer of the coming chil 1 actors. â 
One of tne best features in "Jack and
tbe Beanstalk" is the music, which is due
to a variety of composers, but which has
been excellently selected and would be
well worth hearing a second time.
"Mythological Fancies," the pretty music
played for the spectacular ballet, is due to
William Lorraine, a local composer. Sev
eral of the ball ts in "Jack and the Bean
stalk" are very eraceful and effective, and
the premiere Henella and the character
dancer Rc-monde both do eood wort.
There- are gorgeous scenic effects in the
new spectacle and the costumes are new
and brilliant.
Judging from last night's success, "Jack
and the Beanstalk" is booked for a long
run.
The Hudelflon Libel.
The argument in the libel case against Ben
jamin F. Hudelson brought by Attorney D. B.
Woodworth as to whetner the document upon
which the liDel is based was a privileged com-
I munication was continued before Judge

served his decision till next Thursday.

Cahilfs Sketches in the Top Gallery
I'^ CAN'T see anything in them new-
fangled plays, said the old man, but
_*, he sat quite still and watched every
move the vihain made, nevertheless, just
as though he were taKing a great deal
of interest in it
But there were others in the gallery that
night, and so far as I could see the old
man's face wore the only immobile, expres
sionless look in the entire family circle.
If you want to catch a glimpse of unadul
terated human nature, see it swayed
hither and thither, backward and forward,
as it were, rfirongbont tne entire gamut
of human emotions, spend an evening
with the gallery gods when there is an
old-school melodrama on the boards.
It is hard to tell which is the unreal
\ world, whether the staje or the gallery.
Indeed they work in entire harmony and
sympathy throughout the entire play, if
only the sentiment oi the play be right I
md there is enough "acting" to satisfy
the somewhat critical taste oi the true
connoisseurs of the melodrama. Of course 1
the villain must be foiled at last, or the [
â¢ top gallery, SB a rule, will thin out before
the week is over. And there must be
nothing mawkish about the sentimental
scenes in the play, for those who sit in the
too gallery may turn from gods lo de
mons, and a long, low hiss from the gallery <
is as effective as from any other part of
the house. The pathos must be measured
carefully, and must be of an intensely
human kind, or else instead of tears there
is liable to be laughter In the gallery.
What pleases most of these gallery gods
is the old Milton Noble or Dion Bouci
cault five-act drama, with a sure enough
villain always on the trail of the fair hero
ine and the brave and gallant hero until I
the last scene in the last act. You do i
t:e gallery god an injustice, however, if
yon think he revels only in vulgar gore
and low comedy. His only demand is that
the play be one of genuine human inter
est and that the language be outspoken
and clear. He hates paradoxes and has
no stomach ior the subtleties of expression
' and the far-fetched incidents of some of
tba modern dramas. 'T,;e Vicar of Wake
field, 1 ' with its classic simplicity ot plot,
s.ene and action and its homely out
s; oken phraseology, is plenty good enough
i and none too gov.d to win the hearty ap
preciation of the famiiy circle.
I counted myself fortunate this n T ght in
securing a seat on the front row of tne top
gailery next to the old man, who couid see
nothing "in them new-fangled playt."
But in order to sain this point of vantage
both the old man and myself, as well as
all the others, who occupied the front
rows, bad to wait a good half hour be
tween the time of taking their seat and
the rising of the curtain: One can
"size up," casually, a good many oi one's
near-by neighbors in half an hour, and
one is not Apt to miss the opportunity,
thereby the half-hour wait becomes one of
the most interesting events of the even
ing. These are all Dickens' people up
here â men and women, boys and giris â
but little schooled in the fashionable art
of suppressing natural sentiment, and you
can see irom their faces that when the
curtain goes up the verdict rendered by
the gallery urchins will be spontaneous
and sincere.
It is no matter what the play was.
There was a very beamifal heroine in it,
and almost from the very opening lines
the plot begin to thicken. Now the hero
comes on the stage, tall, handsome, dar
ing and open-hearted. "I love you,
Nora," he cries; then in the distance
crouches as black a scoundrel as ever a
Dickens painted. There is a moment of
deep suspense, and the young man who
sits next to me has his hands on his knees,
his face thrust forward, his mouth and
eyes wide open. His nostrils dilated.
There is an invisible yet certain magnetic
current between him and the stage, and
his heart beats as that current vibrates,
now slowly, now fiercely. I prefer to
watch bis lace rather than the stage, for I
know that the drama I read in his face is
a truer drama, and the emotions ex
pressed by it far more spontaneous and
sincere than is the fictitious stage drama
that causes them. I can see now â watch
ing the play of moving passions upon
those features â that at last the villain and
the hero have met face to face. It will be
a war to the death, unless something in
tervenes, which, of course, it does, because
the play must run till after 10 o'clock.
Presently, I see by the darkening lines on
that face that the villain is gaining
ground. Then the curtain falls on the
first act, and the young man heaves a
long-drawn sigh that seems to come away
up Irom his boots.
Now the hisses commence, and they are
so vigorous and so long drawn out that
tLe villain makes his appearance in front
of the curtain, bows, and is hissed back
into the greenroom.
In the second act the scene is at the
debthbed of the little sister of the heroine,
and I follow the heart beatings and illy
suppressed sobs of the motherly looking
woman who sits almost facing on the up
ward arc of the semicircle. I know when
the deepest chord of human sorrow has
been toucoed, for now the motherly look
ing woman can restrain herself no further.
Her pocket handkerchief suddenly finds
its was to her eyes, and by the time the
-ad scene is all over and the curtain rings
down upon the second act this real woman
has had a cry that will do her good and
make her heart lighter and her sympa
thies more kindly to the troubles of her
neighbor on Natoma ,-trcfet.
The feature of the third act is the rescue
of the heroine by the hero. You
should hear the encore that greets
this denouementâ you should hear it
from the very midst of it, in order to ap
preciate its volume, its depth, its honesty.
There is a vibration of sincerity in it all
that one loses when heard only from the
parquet or dress-circle. Now the plot has
turned, now the hunted turns hunter. It
is the villain who is now pursued. It is
doub ful for a timeâ in the minds of the
gallery godsâ whether the villain will be
finally captured. But, of course, he is, as
really all villains are sooner or later, and
now there is another encore for the hero
that threatens to lift the roof.

the trance is not broken. There is yvt the
j epilogue to be spoken, and when at last it
all ends happily, and when the hard old
man has repented and given his consent
to the union of hero and heroine, and the
low comedy man haa uttered his last gag,
the expression of supreme happiness and
contentment that settles down upon the
faces of my friends in the too gallery, is
something far more pleasing to me than

Qold and Its Uses.
If the average reader or thinker will
devote a few minutes to the. subject of
gold and its uses, and bow much of it an
nuaily disappears by wear, leaving no
possible trace, he will find himself in
volved in some extremely interesting cal
culations. If some genius would only in
vent a power strong enough to attract to it
the millions of invisible particles that
have and are constantly being worn off
the various articles composed of that
metal what an immense amount would be
recovered !
Where do these particles go? Here,
there, everywhere, in your house, on the
streets, in the banks, business houses,
stores and wherever man g >es- As an
instance of this the following is cited:
There is at present a veritable gold mine
being worked in an old watch-case factory
in Brooklyn. It occurred to the new
purchasers of this property that during
the long years of manufacturing of gold
watch cases that took place there, a large
quantity of gold particles must have been
absorbed by the flooring, walls, furnace
chimney, etc. So they went Carefully to
work ana tore the old building down bit
by bit. and burnt and crashed the material,
afterward assayms the ashes. So far
something like $50,000 has been recovered.
Say an ounce oi this lost gold were re
covered. If we melted it down and gilded
a fine silver wire it would extend more
than 1300 miles; or, if nineteen ounces
were recovered (which in the form of a
cube would be about one and a quarter
inches square), ii would gild a wire long
enough to compass the whole earth like a
hoop.
If you pick up a goldleaf, such as is used
for gilding purposes, it becomes a curiosity
in your eyes wtaen you realize that seventy
five square inches of it weigh only one
grain. Now the thousandth part of a line
or inch is easily visible through a common
pocret-glass. Henoe it folldws that when
gold is reduced to the thinness of gold
leaf, 1-50,700,000 of a grain of gold may be
distinguished by the eye. Bat it is claimed
that 1- 140,000, 000 of a grain of gold may be
rendered visible.
Lar^e quantities of gold are used in
gilding portions of exteriors of public and
private buildings. For instance, if we
take the Church of St. Isaac at St. Peters
burg, we find that it required the use of
'247 pounds of gold to gild its five crosses.
They can be seen glittering at a distance
of twenty-seven miles. â Harper's Round

This apparent naval superiority of |
Germany and Italy over the United States
is more imaginary than real, as an an
alysis of the individual armored fleets
will show. The battle-ships and armored
cruisers of the United States are of quite J
the newest build, the oldest only four
years in the water, and they are at least
equal to similar ships of other navies of
recent build. In the German navy nine
of the twenty-one battle-ships were built
prior to 1880 and are obsolete in design
and deficient in armor and armament.
The twelve comparatively new ships
range from 3440 to 9874 tons and agjrre
| gate on'.y 68,728 tons, an average of 5727
i tons, against the average of our ships of
8772 tons. The heaviest guns on the Ger
man armored ships are only 11 inches,
while our battle-ships carry 13 and 12 inch
guns. Being smaller, the German ships
have of necessity thinner armor and less
coal-carrying capacity, which, coupled
with lighter guns, would place them at a
I disadvantage with the American fleet.
1 As for Italy, six of the battle-ships, ag
\ gregating 47,466 tons, were built prior to
I 1880 (two being built in 1863), and may,
therefore, be classed as back-numbers. Of
i the remaining seven armored ships of
84.432 tons, only two have been launched
since 1890. The armor- piercing guns of
these seven ships consists of sixteen 17
inch and twelve 12^-inch guns. The
; larger caliber, weighing 100 to 105 tons,
j have a penetration of 33 to 34 inches of
' iron at the muzzle, while the 13-inch gun
in our navy, weighing only 60 VÂ» tons, will
. penetrate 30 inches oi iron. Monster guns
J are no longer built in any country fcr use
! on board ships, and the tendency is to re
! duce the calibers to 12 inches and less,
j and all the 17-inch guns in tbe Italian
I navy are to be replaced with 10-inch rifles.
When the question of coast-defense ves
sels is- considered, the United Btates is
better off than any of the other naval
i i owers. In the Puritan, Monterey and
| four of the Monadnock class England has
: nothing to compare with these monitors.
The coast-defense fleet of Great Britain is
chiefly composed of antiquated ironclads
no longer seaworthy, and there are at least
thirteen carried on the list of battie-ships
i whose proper place is in the so-called
I coast-defense class, while such armored
! cruisers as the Warrior, Black Prince,
Minotaur, Achilles, Aginconrt and North
umberland, built between 1860 and 1866.
have long outlived their usefulne-s and
should be classed as coast-defenders with
I the other old iron.
The coast-defense vessels of France are
likewise a sorry lot with most formidable
i name's. The six larger vessels of 4600 to
, 5900 tons are imitations of the American
' monitor, to which have been added
enormous superstructures, while the
smaller craft are only armored gunboats.
Russia's coast defense appears to be
I composed of failures relegated to retire
ment in the Black Sea. As for Germany,
her coast-defense fleet consists entirely of
small armored gunboats built between
| 1876 and 1881.
With modern guns the eight monitors
of the Camanche class and five of the Pas
saic class could ably defend our harbors
against attacks from the most formidable
sea-going battle-ships.
In protected cruisers, it will be noted,
the United States comes ahead of Russia
and Germany, and in unprotected cruisers
we lead Russia and Italy. In torpedo
vessels the United States is sadly deficient,
and signally so in torpedo-boat destroyers
and torpedo-boats. Of the two latter
types a small beginning is now being
made, but it will take many years, unless
a war scare comes up, before our list will
compare approximately in number with
those abroad.
And still navy- building is brisk all over
the world, as wil! be seen from the follow
ing table of the several classes of ships un

The only weak spot of our naval defense
is in the lack of guns, ami especially
quick-nrinâ¢ of 6-inch caliber and down
ward. In foreign navies the quick-firer is
being rapidly installed, thus increasing
the efficiency of the vessels at least three
times. It UKes apparently as much time
to build tbe guns as it does to construct
the ships, and Congress should make lib
eral appropriations for armaments.

The Befogging Ibsen Drama and an American Thanksgiving in London
LONDON, Esg , Dec. I.â The past week
has been an exciting one in London. We
have had a blackâ or rather, a green pea
eoup â fog; we have had the first perform
ance of an Ibsen play in the same dayâ
the connection is obvious'; we have bad a
Thanksgiving day dinner at the Ameri
can Society, and picture exhibitions, one
for ev>-ry day in the week! What with a
sprinkling of concerts and teas; what
with reading the latest reports of inter
views with the President-elect, and tbe
latest scandal in "big lif" and the true
and veracious account of everything the
Prince and Princess of Wales did or did
not do at Blenheim â life has been a toil
some and serious affair.
The Ibsen play was "Little Eyolf."
Some harsh critics affirm tbat the fog had
its origin in the theater â there were so
many deep meanings concealed in misty
sentences and sighs and disjointed ejacu
lations. The unprejudic d will be able to
assert that the fog seemed to hover chiefly
over the audience, who seemed in so much
doubt as to the proper amount of expres
THE SOCIETY REPORTER.
Desecration of the Famous Old Castle of Tintagel, the Birthplace of King Arthur
The sad news comes that another spot ot
legendary and poetic interest and sanctity
is in danger of desecration. It is Tintagel
'by tbe Cornish Sea." Tintagel is a primi
tive county Eeacoast place on the north
shore of Cor n-vail, and its castle, now in
the last stages of ruin, was once a mighty
stronghold. King Arthur was born in
the Castle of Tintagel, according to the
accounts of Geoffrey â¢of Monmouth,
and of the poets and chroniclers oi
tbe Court of King Henry 11, while
Lord Tennyson, not wishing for his
own reasons to accept this view ex
actly, devised a story of the baby Ar
thur being washed ashore in the midst
of remarkable elemental disturbances in
the little cove below the castle. Kint,
Mark of Cornwall lived in the Castle of
Tintagel. Thence he sent Tristram to
bring the fair Isolt from Ireland to be his
bride, and it was on the way thither that
the knight and the Princess drank tbe
love potion tbat made them forget the
King and tbe world and all cisc in gazing
at each other. It wa3 in the burial
ground of the castle that they were finally
buried.
Tintagel is a spot of wild and romantic
beauty, but it has been hitherto so inac
cessible, and the accommodations which
it offered for visitors have been so limited,
that it has had comparatively few of
themâ that is to say, few in comparison
with many other places of no greater at
tractiveness. For there is a hotel there
which, though not very large, is uncom
monly good, and the railway now comes
to Camel ford, only six miles away, whence
the ride to Tintagel by carriage or coach
is delightful. So of late years a good many
pc pie who knew of the place have gone
tbtre, and have been glad that they went
and sorry that they did not arrange their
plans of travel so that they could stay
longer.
Many of them have been Americans, of
course, who are always the first to find
places that are worth visiting. There was
no objection to this, any more than there
is ever any objection to any beautiful place
being Â«een by as many people as can see it
without hurting it. But now it is pro*
posed to disfigure Tintagel by a big new
fashioned summer hotel, and to build
some sort of structures or other on Barras
Head, which commands the best view of
the castle. AH this will interfere with
the present beautiful simplicity and pic
turesqneness of tbe place, and if it could
be prevented it would be desirable tbat it
should be.
If the plan to build a hotel at Tintagel
is really serious it will probably be carried
out, but something can be done to save
Barras Head, and that ought to be done.
Tbe National Trust for the Preservation
of Natural Beauty and Historic interest
has the matter in hand, and asks for sub
scriptions for the purpose of buying Bar
ras Head and keeping it away from tbe
touch of vandalism forever. Americans
who feel an interest in preserving so beau
tisul a spot for the future enjoyment of
themselves and their countrymen are
asked to help, and they will no doubt do
â o. The project ought to interest
them no less than Englishmen, and
it is well tbat those who care
for such things should know that one
of the loveliest spots hallowed by the
poetry of the common language of the
two countries is in danger, and tbat tbe
address of the treasurer of tbe fund that
must save it is No. 1 Great College street,
Westminster, 8. W. It should be added
that tbe time for which tbe option of bay*
ing the property was given bae nearly < x
pired, and that subscriptions should be
sent early. Tbe castle itself, with tha
ground on which it stands and the whole
of the big peninsula called Tintagel Head,
belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, and is
therefore tbe property of the Prince of
Walee. So tbe castle is not in danger.
The tillage of Tiotagel is on high
sion to throw into their own faces that i
they did not have much attention left to
give to the play. Tne audience was
quite worta while seeing as a whole â
writers, and artists, and playwrights, and
great ladies, and stage managers, and
journalists. Only London can gather to
gether such a heterogeneous mass of
people.
In the stage-boxes, as the play pro
gressed, you would catch a glimpse of a
head thrust forward in absorbed attention
â Henry James, reserved and melan
choly; Comyns Carr and Pinero, indul
gent, if a little supercilious; "Hanthony
'ope 'awkins â as I heard a newsboy at a
railroad bookstall recommend to an in
quiring customer â Anthony Hope Haw
"kins, between young Justin McCarthy and
bis wifeâ Cissy Loftus, that was. And
there were Will Rothenstein of Yel
low Book fame and Bernard Shaw and
Clement Scott, the critics, and Ibsenian
young women with intense iecee, and ever
so many more!
It would be tempting fate to give any
t round, back half a mile or so from the
shore. A village that should try to staud
un the very edge of the shore at this point
would have a good deal to contend
against, for though the cliffs are lofty
: nd rugged, they are not too high for the
furious spray of the terriole winter seas
that beat upon Cornwall to wash over
them, and it is sometimes as much as the
inexperienced suanger cares to do to
stand against tbe winds that blow in from
he water even on fine days of summer.
The village consists of a few houses, tbe
most of them small ones, ranged along
one street. Tbe hotel, tbe Wharncliffe
Arms, does such a thriving business in
tbe summer that it has to have an annex.
It is of the plain and comfortable sort
that is usually found in the country dis
tricts of England.
The way to the castle from the village is
along the street, down a grassy lane, up
over a hill and across a heathery down.
Then, perched on the very edge of a great
precipice, the castle is reachedâ that is to
say, half of it is reached, The visitor who
has not been told what to expect will be
surprised to find that tbe other half of the
castle is so situated that he will have to
take an altogether different way to get to
it, or else make a short cut down to the
bouse where the key is kept, along so
steep a grade that be will need to be care
ful not to make the latter part of tbe jour
ney headlong.
For the castle is on both sides of a deep
gorge, which separates the mainland from
the peninsula Tintagel Head, commonly
called "tbe island," because it comes so
near being one. Tne connecting isthmus
is a narrow, rocky ridge, almost down to
the water's edge at high tide. It is fairly
well shown in one of the pictures here
given. This gorge was once narrower, it
is said, and there was a bridge across it,
connecting tbe two parts of the castle.
The bridue was gone nobody knows how
long ago, and the terrible attacks of the sea
and the wind upon the rocks that the
castle stands upon have worn and torn
them away till the gorge itself is widened
and much of the castle must have fallt-n
into the pit below it.
It was built of the same sort of slate as
the rock on which it stands, and if the su
per-esthetic visitor thinks that the pros
pect is injured by the slate quarry down
at the bottom of tbe gorge be may console
himself with the thought that at any rate

times touching. The second and third

Courtney Thorpe did the bookish prig

acted exquisitely and had the most deli
cate and charming part, and Mrs. Patrick
Campbell made of the Rat Wife a figure so
weird, so grewsome and so picturesqe that
she stamped her personality upon ail the
rest of the play, permeating it, although
only five minutes actually before tbe audi
ence.
The critics, I verily believe, sat up all
night over their virtuous tasKs. What
ever unpleasantness had escaped the mul
tftude in the performance itself was
dragged to the light of day and discussed
in the most pleasing and open manner
from the highest moral standpoint. I be
lieve William Shakespeare of Stratford
on-Avon once assertedâ is it in Hamlet?â
that "there is neither good nor evil, but
thinking makes it so." In this cass the
critics thought to most excellent purpose,
and the poor benighted men and women
of duller perception who had listened
without a blush now blush to think they
did not blush. Of course, since then no
further places can be purchased, every
mat is sold for tbe remaining four per
formances.
"This is a strange vorld," as Sam Weller
7 ould have said.
The American Thanksgiving dinner at
the Hotel Cecil was a "magnificent affair,"
it is no modern inn ovation, for the quarry
must have been here or somewhere near
here before King Arthur's lime, else how
could the castle have been built of the
slate for him to be born in?
The visitor will not get far in his ex
plorations before be will begin to sre
what n strong place this must have been
to resist all the possible attacks of an
cient warfare. If the wind is not blowing
so hard as to make it dangerous he will
crawl upon the highest place of the wall
now left of the castle, which is also the
part furthest inland. It is a heavy piece
of masonry, and the top of it is wide
enough to make a comfortable walk, if it
were not for the wind that has been men
tioned once or twice before.
It is a glorious view all up ana down the
coast from the castle. To the west and
south there are headlands after headlands
(for the whole coast of Cornwall is made
up of them) till the most boldly jutting
one of them cuts off the further view in
.the direction of Lands End. To the
north and east there is Barras Head, the
one that is now to be saved from tbe
spoiler, and then again headland after
as the eociety journals would chronicle it.
It was rather disappointing from one
standpoint and infinitely amusing from
another. That Minister Bayard, who
would have presided with so much dig
nity, was inconsiderately invited to Wind-
sor to dine with the Queen on this very
day caused some vexation probably eTan
to Minister Bayard himself.
This fact is likely to be a little misun
derstood. Mr. Bayard had no option in
regard to accepting or refusing the invi
tation; he could not consult his personal
wishes any more than a young and ambi
tious lieutenant may who is asked by the
commanding officer, General So-and-So,
to conduct his aged grandmother to
church. Mr. Bayard would probably have
preferred to be "first in his little village,"
especially with "turkey and pun'kin pie"
as his reward. His absence was very
much to be regretted.
It is rather a sad comment on American
oratory that the best speeches of tbe even
ing were delivered by Sir Frank Lockwood
and Sir Richard Webster. The contrast
between the post-prandial efforts of these
shining lights of the English bar and
those of our own countrymen was a little
painful. The comparison was unavoida
ble. Sir Frank Lockwood especially pro
posed the health of the President of the
United States in a speech that was so hu
morous, so cordial and so fine, in language
so choice and a voice so perfectly modu
lated, vigoious and clear, that it was a rare
pleasure to listen to it. Of the American
speeches only one was even audible; that
was delivered, with great ability, by Mr.
R. Newton Crane, who has probably been
disciplined by his long years of practice in
London. As a rule it was possible to
headland, away toward Boscagtle. Straight
out from the shore there is the open
sea. It is the open sea, tbat is to say, as
far as" tbe eye can tell. Beyond the hori
zon, if you are looking far enough to tbe
north, is Ireland. It is straight across
this sea that the ship is sailing when the
curtain rises on the first act of "Tristan
and Isolde,'' and it must have been down
in the little cove under the castle, the lit
tle cove shown in the picture, that Tris
tram's ship came to anchor.
Over on the island, down close to the
water of the cove, there is a little fragment
of battlementea wall, with a door in it,
which looks as if it migot have been con
nected with a landing-place, and you can
believe, if you want to, that King Mark
stood at this exact spot to welcome his
bride, the Irish Princess.
The mention of the island brings the
account of the place back to where it be
longs. If you want to go to the part of
the castle on the island it will be better to
make up your mind to that effect before
you leave the village, instead of trying to
make your way there from the mainland
cart of the castle* Then you will take the
catch a word here and there by straining
the attention, by clutching tne ear and
bending it forward like a very old person
in the habit of using an ear trumpet.
Sudden sentences were shouted as
though addressing a camp-meeting, and
others were whispered facetiously, cvi'
dently for the delectation of the immedi
ate neighbors of the speaker. If it could
have been put to vote I think there wou'.a
have been a unanimous resolution passed
that every man or woman with aspira
tions for the after-dinner laurels should be
forced to spend a year at an institution
where it would be possible to study voice
culture and the fine art of oratory.
The dinner itself was lavish. An army
of waiters served the 800 guests; a sou
venir volume, bound in red leather, writ
ten and illustrated for tbe occasion, was
presented to each and every happy person,
And the great banqueting hall of the hotel,
like the hall of some medieval castle, was
superb even under the decorative infliction
of hundreds of small cotton flags â
ha'penny editions of the star-spangled
banner â and the shields and emblems of
all the States and Territories.
As a whole the guests were representa
tive of that curious specimen, the Ameri
can abroad, but a more unrepresentative
gathering of Americans as they are at
home it has never been my pleasure to
see. The beautiful" American girl was a
rara avis. Mrs. Paul Cowles of San Fran
cisco was unquestionably the prettiest
woman in the room.
Of other San Franciscans I saw only
Mr. and Mrs. Denis O'Sullivan, Miss Hey
nemannand Colonel Alexander G. riawes,
all hough I strained my eyes.
It was almost as hard to see as to hear
path down the ravine, between the castle
and Barras Head, till you come to the
little house that is shown in the pictureâ
the little house away down the ravine,
not the one in tbe foreground, which is
almost as much a ruin as the castle itself.
In the little house lives an old woman
who makes her living from her ancient
privilege of keeping tne key of the castle.
Go to the door and knock, tell her politely
that it would be a favor to you if she
would lend you the key, and she will lend
it to you. Then you go along by the only
path there is, so that you cannot lose your
way across the connecting ridge and up
tbe steep shore of the island till you get
to the castle wall and the door with the
lock which your key fits. This bit of wall
is only a few yards long, yet so steep is the
rocky side of the island with this one little
path up its sifle that it would be extremely
difficult and dangerous to gain any access
to the island except through this door.
When you are once throngh you will
find easy ways over the whole or it, and
you can explore it at your leisure and un
disturbed, except for some few other
visitors who have borrowed duplicate keys
from the old woman. Tbe ruins here are
not quite so far gone as those across the
gorge, being on the sheltered side of the
island instead of the exposed aide of the
mainland. If the island has protected the
castle it has felt the fury of the sea itself.
The cave that shows its mouth in the
picture goes clear through the headland,
and .you can walk all the way through it
at low tide if you do not mind getting
yonr feet wet.
In toward the middle of the island is
the chapel. All that is left of it is the
foundations of the walls and the altar.
This ia a slab of stone at one end of the
room. It was found lying on the ground,
and it was so clearly an old altar stont
that it was set up at thn usual height of
an altar, so that it now clearly marks the
use of the place. There is an inclosure
near this which is called the castle grave
yard. A curious natural â or apparently
natural â formation of the island is known
as King Anhur's Seat. It is a sort of
double throne, hollowed out of the rock
on the side toward the land. It is any
thing but a comfortable seat and the view
from it is inconsequential compared with
the glorious prospect from the other side
of the island. King An bur had bad taste
if he spent any great amount of time sit
ting in it.
When you have seen aa much of the
f across that vast ball, and it was only Dy
means of the table card that we could
trace the celebrity to his lairâ to his chair,
more properly speaking. So we .liscovered
that Mrs. Craigia (John Oliver Hobbes)
was seated between a man's active black
arm and a laJy's waving fan; that the
heads seen now and then between moving
waiters and a number of backs belonged
to Mr. and Mrs. H. M. Stanley. He
looked bent and white and old, and Miss
Dorothy Tennant that was looked fresh
add charming and young. Poultney Bige
;ow sat in close proximity to the con
tingent from San Franc sco, and seemed
to enjoy himself even without his most
intimate friend, the Emperor William of
Germany. Opposite him sat the writer
George ManvLie Fenn, and at the head of
this table the delightful, incomparable
Benjamin Franklin Stephens, secretary of
the society, beamed upon bis particular
guests.
It would be an interesting if somewhat
complicated task to try to discover just
how many "really and truly" Americans
there were. They had a provincial air,
the greater proportion. The young men
had"a patient expression like clerks in a
fancy-goods shop â store, I would sayâ and
the ladies' costumes appeared to have
come with the ladies themselves from the
regions of Petaluma and Milpitas. They
were astonishingly original. One most
impressive scene was the entrance of a
bride, apparently just risen from her wed
dinz breakfast. She was 6 feet 3 in height,
and the happy bridegroom was fair, fat and
5 feet 4. Long streamers of gauze and tin
sel floated about her, and artificial orange
blossoms were caught here and there. I
have made cireful inquiries about the spe
cial character of her sleeve 3, and have
beard it authoritatively asserted that they
are called angel sleeves.
island as you care for you must take tbe
key back to the old woman, and then you
can give her anything you like tor the use
of it, or nothing, if you are that kind of
person.
There are many finer ruins than Tintagel
within a thousand miles of it, but there
are few anywhere which the sentimental
visitor can more thoroughly enjoy. He is
not bothered with the surroundings of a
dirty modern town, with the jarring and
elaborate conveniences of modern hotel
life, with the nuisance of officious guides
or with many visitors. It is tbe place to
rest, to breathe pure breezes â sometimes
gales â to dream of King Arthur and to
feel the full spirit of poetry and chivalry
and beauty.
y\r\achror\isms ir\ Art.
"The French artist whose picture in the
Paris Salon a few years ago showed the
eccentricity of presenting a cavalier of the
time of Louis XIV armed with a modern
revolver was not alone in his an
achronism," says Henry Granville in the
Home Journal. "Some of tne early painters
were amusingiy careless about such mat
ters. Tintoretto, in a picture of the chil
dren of Israel gathering manna, represents
them as having taken the precaution of
arming themselves with shotguns. When
Cigoli painted the aged Simeon at the cir
cumcision of the infant Savior, which
pictare is now in St. Petersburg, be re
membered that aged men wear spectacles,
and so placed these conveniences upon
Simeon's nose.
"In a pictare by Verrio of Christ heal
ing the sick the bystanders era represented
with periwigs. The ludicrous effect is
equaled in Albert Durer's picture of the
expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Gar
den of Eden by an angel wearing a
flounced petticoat. The same artist, in
bis scene of Peter denying Christ, depicts
a Roman soldier quietly enjoying a pipe
of tobacco.
"Of all the artists who have sinned
against propriety or probability, the
Dutch and Flemish have been among the
most eccentric. In the Museum of Vienna
there is a picture of 'Christ Bearing the
Cross, 1 by Peter Brueghel the elder, which
shows Christ carrying his bnrden, while a
monk, crucitix in hand, exhorts the two
thieves to die repentant.
"Nicholas Poussin has represented the
deluge with boats at hand ready for use,
and on another canvas 'Rebecca at th?
Well' is seen with Grecian architecture in
tbe background. And in a picture repre
senting 'Lobsters in the Sea, Listening to
the Preaching of St. Anthony of fadua,'
the lobsters are red, although as yet
it is fair to presume unboiled. A French
artist has depicted the Lord's 8 upper,
the table beina ornamented with tumblers
filled with cigar-lighters; and the Virgin
Mary, in another work of the same
nationality, is helping lerself to a cup of
coffee from a chased coffee-pot.
"But drollest of all blunders is that
which portrays the Garden of Eden with
Adam and Eve in all their primeval sim
plicity, while near them, in full costume,
is seen a hunter with a gun shooting
docks."
A flavjfu! Elephant.
A most remarkable incident happened
m the early hours of Sunday morning to a
police constable on duty in the High
Road, Clapton. It appears that on Satur
day night a traveling circus gave a per
formance on Mount Pleasant Fields, and,
as is usual, struck the tent soon after the
close of the entertainment. Among tne
amimals was a performing elephant, and
this, in the charge of a keeper, was dis
patched to the next stopping-place.
All was quiet as the pair jogged along,
bat when nearing Goulton road, High
It is a matter of deep regret to me that I
have never cultivated the acquaintance of,
the society reporter, whose eagle eye would
at once have ascertained whether the skirt
was gored or â or some other thing. The
fan that she waved carelessly to- and fro
was a quaint conceit. It would have or
namented a hear3e; it looked like the wing
of an enormous mythological bird â ana
the waiters circled around it with great
respect. The vegetable decorations of the
bridegroom in his buttonhole were of the
same delicate proportions. They walked
across the room, the lady sailing forward
with her wing spread, the gentleman hop
ping over her train in a most stately
manner. It was quite in the spirit of a
court function, especially as represented
on the stage at. the Grand Opera
house with slow music Speaking of
music reminds me that the musical pro
gramme added largely to the patriotic
feelings of those present. We enjoyed
first "God Save the Queen," then the
"Star-spangled Banner," in which tne
chorus was sustained by 800 voices in 800
different keys. "Th* Old Folks at Home,"
sung by Mme. Belle Cole, with the notes
sustained to a point that made the audi
ence transfixed with the fear that she
would never catch her breath again, was
applauded, after that feat was successfully
accomplished in the most satisfactory
manner.
On the whole, however, the American
dinner if it gives an unscrupulous journal
an opportunity to poke fun, was distinctly
enjoyable and has a most admirable object,
to promote good feeling and cordiality
among the exiles abroad. In spite of the
frivolous tone of this communication the
"object all sublime" of the dinner is
nevertheless deeply appreciated and grate

but he little thought of the trick* it was

into a garden and closed the iron gates

worry how and where to procure the means
necessary to fill that vacuum nature most
abhorsâ an empty stomach. How does
San Francisco provide for those who
must work in daylight and study at
night, if at all? Let us consider.
The Lincoln Night School has 1400
pupils enrolled, ranging in age from
12 to 60 years and engaged in every con
ceivable employment, from cashboy and
servant-girl upward. Classes are graded
as in the day scuools, with the exception
that there is not yet a senior High Pcnool
class. The teachers number thirty-five,
including the principal, Alexander H.
McDonald. Besides the common branches
of education instruction is given in me
chanical and architectural drawing, Span
ish and physics.
The clever mechanic who can be his'own
draughtsman is invaluable to his em
ployer, and the opportunity is here of
fered to the ambitious, and is already em
braced by about ninety young men. For
the department a; physics a laboratory is
furnished, where the students experi- i
merit. Monthly 8 lecture, with illustra
tions, is given by some professor from the
University of California, on subjects such
as, "A Trip Through Medieval England," j
"Tbe Eye," "English Schools" and "The I
Brain."
In the adult class is an old man who
furnishes an example of indefatigable
earnestness. He is 60 years old and was
at one time a schoolteacher in Germany.
Emigrating from therein the '70's, he set
tled in Dakota, where he invested his
money in real estate and then lost it.
Seeking employment, he found his lack of
English a serious bar, so he courageously
set our to surmount it. Now he is a pupil
at the evening class of the Lincoln School,
and here one sees him plodding and
striving with as much trustfulness as
if he were yet in the bright springtime of
life.
Among the boys under the guidance of
Mrs. Brownson one may find much of the
stuff that great men were marie of. One
little fellow whose happy smile would
make you think he oaskÂ«din perpetual sun

eyes, they looked somehow as they made
him feel nohow"â tell of great longing?.
He arises about 5 a. m. and works untii 6

cooting and waiting, and is content to
study hard from 7:30 to 9:15 o'clock every
evening. He says he may be proprietor of
a restaurant some day, and indeed he
may be. Another leaves his home in the
vicinity of the Five-mile House in the
"sma* wee" hours, carrying his lunch and
supper with him, laboring all day, attend
ing evening school and arriving home at
10:30 o'clock every night.
A sad case of unpardonable nedect is
that of a boy 16 years old, a molder by

Life Romance That Chilled the Blood of Listeners at a San Francisco Dinner Party
TÂ£"I^ILLIAM THOMAS of the law firm
n/\/^ Â° f Ch^ ckerin S. Thomas & Gregory
iM/Myi is one of the most graphic story
tellers in San Francisco. Gifted with
an exquisite felicity of language, possess
ing a strong sense of the dramatic, prac
ticed in public speaking and of fine ap
pearance, when he tells a story he makes
an impression wliic i even those inimit
able after-dinner orators, Horace G. Platt
and Cbauncey M. Depew, may well envy.
Not many evenings ago some of the
most cultured and accomplished men on
the coast, members of a Greek-letter so
ciety which her?, owing to the etiquette of
such organizations, must remain name-
Jess, were sitting around the festive board.
Wit and repartee, pathos and humor, all
had their play; the eioquence of Horace
G. Piatt nad glittered; and in the hazy
atmosphere of memory the whole com
pany once more breathed as boys and
were boys in spirit, so that any laugh was
infectious and life itself was a humorous
wriole, unmarred by the past and un
menaced by the future. -
Then up rose William Ihomas with a
story of life experience, full of adventure,
full of the unexpected, replete with
pathosâ a classic in all respects. He
spoke in the first person. ' He was the one
principally concerned.. His. voice some
times trembled, his eyes seemed to dim
and blur, but perhaps that was caused by
the smoke wreaths rising from many fra
grant cigars and . perfuming the air. Vis
ibly he was affected. 1 His heart was
touched with the memory of what was
pathetic. His mind grasped and repro
duced, with marvelous fidelity, the small
details of landscape, and even words which
were of the long ago.
- His auditors listened as the life story
grew upon them, and the denouement
found them with bated breath, with looks
of surprise in their eyes, and they con
sidered Mr. Thomas with new interest.
Then the certainty dawned on them that
Mr. Thomas had pioneered the way in
club life to a new and delightful form of
after-dinner' entertainment. - Precipient
Burtons felt within them the germs of
romances airy as the dreams contained in
the "Arabian Nights" or in Grimm's im
mortal book of fairy tales. Stimulated by
the king of after-dinner story-tellers, their
minas were grateful to him,' for while the
cromain of romance is infinite the set re
sponses to set toasts about "fair Harvard"
or "Yale, our Alma Mater," after a time
â  become l difficult. .-â '.'..
So. when the applause echoed and re
echoed from all around the board of amity,
tribute was at once paid to a story-teller
and a discoverer. -
Truly the life story told by Mr. Thomas
was a moving tale. It began with the
time when Mr. Thomas was a young law
yer in his father's office in New York and,
consistently, strucK its roots into litiga
tion in which : Mr. Thomas' father was
concerned as an attorney. According to
his own story. Mr. Thomas was not con
sidered to be much of a budding lawyer
by his, father. : -â  Â
It appears that he had done in college
much as other students might. He had a
good time, studied some, was something

Woman wields the scepter at the Wash
ington Evening School and succeeds in
maintaining perfect discipline among 500
scholars. Miss P. M. Nolan, the first
woman ever made principal ot a night
school, is in command here.
This institution is extremely cosmopoli
tan. The native son, the German, Ital
ian, Spanish, Servian, Slavonic, negro,
and even a native of the Fiji Islands sit
side b\' side and labor together for a com
mon aim.
The motto of the school, which has been
beautifully engraved by one of its younger
members, is "We work to win."
Two teachers, both linguists, have
charge ot the foreign classes. One of these
tells what may seem an improbable story
now bears evidence, but he had his career
as a lawyer all ahead of him. It was
necessary to find a witness in East Ten
nessee. William Thomas was instructed
to undertake this mission.
Passing over the details of the law case,
which were in themselves of some inter
est, being peculiar, young William Thomas
may be considered to have taken his jour
ney from New York and to have arrived
in East Tennessee and to be riding through
a thinly peopled country. The people
were singular in some respects, especially
so the farther be pushed forward into the
heart of the mountains. Their mien was
intrepid but Kindly. He soon learned to
appreciate them for their true worth.
It was now night in the Tennessee for
est. After a long and hard ride of a day,
Mr. Thomas' horse was unable to go
farther. The rider had hoped to reach
his destination that day and so had driven
harder than he would otherwise have done.
The disablement of his horse and the
gathering darkness gave him a natural
feeling of uneasiness. He could do noth
ing but push on. Tbe house where the
witness was supposed to be was some
miles distant. The chance of meeting any
one who could direct him exactly grew
less with the loss of daylight
However, as he journeyed on foot be met
a Tennessee mountaineer who knew the
man for whom he was searching. From
him young Mr. Thomas received instruc
tions and pushed along. The woodchop
pers had piled up fuel throughout the for
est and made many trails as they tramped
to and fro with their heavy boots. It
would have been difficult by. daylight to
keep the main trail. It was now practi
cally, impossible.
Walking rapidly the traveler traversed
many miles, passing the cottage which he
sought without knowing it. He was about
discouraged when a gleam of light was
seen. This widened out as progress was
made until it was seen to be a ra-ther large
campfire. About it armed men were mov
ing. Other armed men were Iyinj; prone
on the ground. Here was a mystery, sure
enough, and Mr. Thomas went toward
the fire â not to investigate, but to get in
formation; or, failing in this, to get food
and a plnce to pass the night.
Suddenly Mr. Thomas fell to the ground.
An outpost of the men around the fire had
come upon him unaware and had knocked
him down with the stock of a gun or some
other weapou.
"That scar," said Mr. Thomas to his
after-dinner audience, "1 carry to this
day. I was struck on the back of my head
and the hair has never grown on that spot
since that night.' 1
For a time he was unconscious. When
he regained his senses his position was
sufficiently unusucl to be interesting. He
had been taken up limp and helpless and
tied to a tree. Now he was surrounded by
rough men, whose minds were full of sus
picion. Whether they were "moonshin
ers," counterfeiters or other outlaws they
had no desire to make his acquaintance.
He was clearly an unwelcome guest.
One of the border ruffians advanced to
ward him, drawing from the leather belt
around his girdle a long, sharp knife. Mr.
Thomas held his breath, not knowing

what would happen next and being en
tirely helpless. The knife was raised and
fell on his. left biceps, which still bears the
i scar as a souvenir of that memorable
j night.
This attack seemed to satisfy the moun
taineers for the present, but the indica
tion furnished concerning their intentions
by tHis preliminary onslaught was not
particularly reassuring to a man who
could not move hand or foot
BOUND TO A TREE AND A KNIFE THRUST AT HIS HEART.
The fire crackled sullenly among the
logs and twigs heaped upon it. Gathered
around the fire were the mountaineers,
who consulted concerning him. They
drank deep potations of "mountain dew"
and seemed inclined to be quarrelsome.
But they made no further move to molest
him that night. One by one they dropped
off to sleep, leaving only one man to stand
guard.
Mr. Thomas did not sleep. There was a
strange fascination in the sight of the fire,
iof a French woman who had lived
through seventy summers and was in her
class for a year and a half. When she ap
plied for admission she could neither read
nor write English and could speak it very
slightly. She had been well educated in
her own language, and although living in
San Francisco for thirty years had asso
ciated only with French people. Her
husband died, leaving her to coriduct a
large business with her son. Then she
began to feel the need lor an English edu
j cation, which she sought and found at the
i nieht sehooi.
A case which ought to bring success, if
; e:iriy rising, hard labor and diligent study
I will brins it, is that of a boy who at 3:30
i in the morning starts out on his milk
I route. He breakfasts at 6a. m. and by 7
j o'clock is at bis post in a butcher-shop,
; where he remains the rest of the day. In I
the evening he goes to school for two
hours, where he tries to keep awake and
fill his brain with knowledge. Many
other praiseworthy examples of youthful
struggles are to be found in the night
schools of San Francisco.
Money â how to make it, wÂ£ere to de
posit it, how to expend it, and, perhaps,
best of all, hovr to keep it â is knowledge
craved by many and possessed by few. . A
thorough business training is the surest
means to the attainment of this knowl
edge. And to furnish at least the rudi
ments of this there is tbe work of the
Business Evening School on Bush and
Stockton streets. Fifteen rooms are oc
cupied nightly by tyros eager to grasp any
information which will assist them in the
busy mart. Very little theoretical work
is taught, but the latest improved practi
cal methods are used in typewriting,
surrounded by dusky figures; and in the
forest, which In the darkness penetrated
only by the flickering firelight, seemed
illimitable. He mused on the perilous
and singular position he found himself
placed in, and naturally wondered what
the outcome of the adventure would be.
"Say, stranger, what really brought you
here and what do you want?"
The gruff voice he heard came from the
sentry, who had drawn near him.
Before he could answer, the sentry saw [
on the young lawyer's coat a society pin, i
indicating bis membership of the Greek |
letter society.
"Where did you get that?' 1 demanded
the sentry.
"I am a member of the society," re
sponded the lawyer.
To his surprise the lawyer found that
the sentry was a member of the same fra
ternity.
"But what are you doing here?" iosist-
Ed the backwoodsman.
"I came to find , who is wanted as a
witness in a law case. Do you know
him?"
A strange expression came over the face
of the man.
"Why, yes," he said, "that is I did know
him ; in fact I killed him a week ago."
"Killed him!"
"Yes. You see he was abusing his
daughter Mollie and I interfered. Then
be came for me, and I had to shoot him in
self-defense."
Mr. Thomas looked carefully at the man
and was satisfied he was telling the truth.
There was no use remaining any longer in
that neighborhood, and as the sentry cut
him loose he lost no time in departing and
in a few days he was back in his father's
o trice in New York.
Time took the edge from this adven
ture, but the young lawyer's mind natu
rally waa inquisitive and he sometimes
stenography, penmanship, bookkeeping
and banking. The principal and teachers
engaged for instruction in these Â«tudie3
are, with the exception of five lady teach
ers, men whose daily life brings them into
constant intercourse with some of the
best firms and banking establishments in
the City. '
Studying stenography and typewriting
there are about 250 pupils, who are given
dictation and copy for two hours every
evening. The standard in stenography is
eighty words a minute, though many are
able before completing the year's course
to take over 100 words. Tneir speed, for
the shortness of time devoted to the work,
is remarkable.
The six departments devoted to book-
Keeping, under the supervision of the
principal, are in a flourishing condition.
, wondered what the yoang girl in the Ten
nessee mountains, who had been protected
by the young mountaineer, really looked
like and what had happened to her. The
wounds on his head and biceps healed
after a little. Months passed and, alter
a while, Mr. Thomass emigrated to Cali
fornia and engaged actively in the practice
of law in this City.
One da 7, years ago, a letter was de
livered which bore a postmark showing
that it came from Tennessee. Mr.
Thomas' thoughts traveled speedily back
ward until, by the time that he had the
seal broken, he was, at least in memory,
back in the Tennessee fastness, with the
firelight making the trunks of the trees
about it ruddy at midnicht and a half
drunken crew of backwoodsmen and
mountaineers sullenly watching and
discussing him.
The letter added another chapter to the
romance, for it contained a card announc
ing the marriage of the man who had
acted as sentry to the girl whose father he
bad murdered for her sake. She had been
through a period of mourning, not un
mixed with bitterness, but the slayer of
her father, admiring her, had presented
himreif as a suitor for her hand and she
had agreed to marry him. Glanciug at
tbe date on the wedding card, the lawyer
saw that the happy event bad already
taken place. On the card were written
the words:
â¢'She asked me." \
"He asked me."
The first inscription was in a man's
handwriting and the other in a woman's.
Mr. Thomas hastened to extend his con
gratulations and the customary wishes for
happiness and prosperity, and also sent
the bride a present.
"GeDtlemen," said Mr. Thomas, "I have
not told this story in many years, and
then only to my wife. But to-day, as I
was walking along Montgomery street, I
met the man who that night set me free
in â  the Tennessee woods. He is a well*
known and prominent man now on the
Pacific Coast, and has lived here with his
wife, the heroine of this romance, for some
years. I told him that I wou.d tell his life
storv here to-night. At first he said 'no,'
but then said 'very well.' So I hava told
it; and, gentlemen, you all know him!"
Then the story-teller sat down. The as
sembled fraternity men paused for a
moment and then heartily applauded the
narrative, which toad all the earmarks of
truth.
But it was not true. When it was ap
parent that all the company had been
fooled, Mr. Thomas announced that the
story was pure romance, invented by him
and carefully worked out as to details, to
furnish something new. It waa new and
the fraternity men unanimously voted it
to be a success.
Duties of Prime Ministers*
iiet us consider for a moment what is
the real, as contrasted with the theoreti
cal, position of the Prime Minister. In the
first place the Prime Minister, as a rule,
makes his Cabinet. He is commissioned
by the Queen to form a Cabinet, because
he is the man whom she considers to pos
For the first half year the bookkeeping is
entirely theoretical. In the second half
commences the practical work, and before
the year is concluded the pupil has had
dealings with thirty-two firms, each in a
different line of business.
The greatest proof of the success of thin
institution is that many of the leading
business ; firms of this City make applica
tion to the principal for typewriters,
stenographers, clerks and bookkeepers.

Why the Lest Walk in Circles.
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: In
the issue of your valuable paper ot the
6th inst. I noticed an article headed "Why
Do the Lost Walk in Circles?" and con
cluded to answer the final question. In
1858 I was teaching in what was then
Washington Territory. In a treeless in
closure across the road from the school
house there were several niiich cows.
After several days they became quite a
nuisance by their continual bellowing.
My attention was called more closely to
them, and I noticed that they would hold
up their heads and sniff several times,
and then, lowering their bend?, they
would start to walk, and, walking rapidly,
theywould soon strike a circle, when they
woujd shortly repeat the performance.
At noon I questioned the children, and
the older ones said the entile wanted
water from the creek, but had eaten a veg
etable which destroyed their sight tempo
rarily â the same as the rattleweed in Cali
fornia destroys the sense of horses. A
quiet, gentle horse eating ruttlaweed be
comes idiotic and will neither lead nor
drive. After a few days the cattle would
recover their sight, but it takes a year or
more for a horse to recover from loco.
Since that time I have often used what
I learned from the blind cow. On the
Spokane plains and elsewhere I have often
blinded my horse at noon, and. if well
done he could not get off an acre of ground
in a half day.
With all animals that walk single
footed, they turn to the light. A pacing
horse may turn to the left. Most alt
right-handed persons turn to the right if
blindfolded, and most of those who are
left-handed are also left-footed; but some
right-handed persons when ready to
jump, rise from the left foot, and vice
versa. In my judgment, these facts poinc
to a general law which would be easily
verified or disproved by a test. Yours
respectfully, B. F. C. Ross
Raymond, Cal., Dec. 14.
â¢ââ¢ â # â .
From June. 1791, to November; 1813, the
French Government enrolled 4,556.000
men, nearly three-fourths of whom died
in battle, of wounds or of diseases con
tracted in the field.
sess the confidence of a majority of the
House of Commons. He forms his Cabi
net by asking certain members of the two
houses to hold the great offices of state.
He might do tHis one day and without
consulting any one.
As a matter of fact, what usually hap
pens is this: As soon as the commission
to form a government has been received,
the Prime .Minister takes into his con
fidence the two or three men who will
hold the chief offices, and they together
talk over the other names. When a man
is decided upon, he as a. rule joins the
conclave and helps to consult as to men
and places, and so the Cabinet gradually
evolves itself. No doubt, as generally
happens in this world, the Prime Min
ister's choice is never really free. Certain
men must be in the Cabinet whatever
happens, and hence they may be said not
to be chosen by the Premier, but to be
Ministers in their own right.
In spite, however, of this, the fact that
they are asked to serve by the Premier
makes them feel his superiority. When
the Cabinet is made the theory of the un
written constitution is that the Cabinet
governs. In reality it seldom does any
thing of the kind. Each Cabinet Minister
has very great power in bis own depart
ment, but the Cabinet as a Cabinet can do
little. Since, however, it knows every
thing, or almost everything that is going
on, it can exercise a great deal of indirect
power. The previous knowledge that the
majority of the Cabinet would like or dis
like a particular policy has a great influ
ence, but still the Cabinet does not rule.
Who, then, really rules? The Prime
Ministerâ but limited in a way which we
must describe later. What gives the
Prime Minister this power? In the first
place, he summons and presides over, and
so largely controls, the Cabinet meetings.
Next, if a vacancy occurs he fills it up,
and so can promote men from the lower
to the higher offices. Then he can and
does confer with his colleagues in regard
to the business of their departments and
so has a hold upon the whole machine of
government. Sir Robert Peel saw every
member of his Cabinet separately every
day.
Again, if there is a difference between
two other members of the Government
the Premier decides. If there is an irre
concilable difference between himself and
a Minister it is the Minister and not the
Premier who resigns. Lastly the Prime
Minister can, by resigning himself, dis
solve the whole Ministry. These things,
small in themselves, taken together make
the Prime Minister's position what it is.
He makes and can unmake a
Cabinet. He presides over it, and he has
the right to advise in regard to every
department, though this right is, of
course, seldom exercised, and he has
secured to him beforehand the support of
the rank and file of any Cabinet, if it
comes to a struggle between him and a
colleague, because the rank and file know
that if the Premier is beaten, he has it in
his power to upset the whole machine of
government. Hence tbe voices of those
who want to keep in cilice are always
found on the side of the Premier. â London

daughter of Mrs. Mintzner. Many ol their

Is Duplicate Whist Degenerating?
The size of the score seems to be the stand
ard of quality or excellence of whist-play in
many of the whist clubs in this section of the
country. We seldom if ever hear the question
asked, "Did you have a good game?" "Any in
teresting deals?" No, it is, "Which w.ay did
you sit?" "What was your score?" The style
of game that we particularly refer to-isthls:
"Play a tray or two and skip to the next
table," and tbe first thing that is done is to
look over the score of your new adversaries,
see what they made on deals that the "skip
pers" have not played and then do anything
to beat that score. We dubbed this sort of
play "merry-go-round" whist. We have no
use for this kind of game ourselves when we
cannot play "two-table duplicate," the only
game of duplicate whist that is an actual test
of skill. We olay it for the want of something
better. We feel toward this .style of game as
we do when we go up to our shooting pre
serves: if we cannot get canvasbacks we will
put up with "spoonies."
Is it not arjout time that a new style of came
for general club play was given to the whist
world ? If John T. Mitchell, the father of du
plicate whist, don't hurry up and give us a
new game we will have to show up "solitaire
whist."

Our whist editor should not attempt to gild
arose to try and beautify it. Neither can we
aria anything to the above criticism, but we
can say in our twenty years' whist experience
we never received anything pertaining to the
game the anticipation of which gave us so
much real pleasure as this now work that
comes from our Queen.
No little one ever emptied a Christmas
stocking with moro real enjoyment than we
experienced when wo cut the twine containing
this precious voiume. Sweet and dainty sure
enough. The exquisite taste displayed by her
Majesty did not forget that rough hands like
ours were never mud* to handle such a deli
cate little treasure without some protection,
so she has the cream white binding-covered
with parchment. Tne front cover bears the
simple word, "Wnisl," em-bossed in large red
letters. We carefully raise the cover aud find
there this inscription:
"Mr. : Please accept this book of rules.
Deal gently with it but honestly, as you have
always done, Is all I ask. Kate Wheelock."
Miss Wheelock's friends from the Atlantic to
the Pacificâ and they are legion â can make
elegant use of this whist work as Christmas
offerings.

EAR FOR PHONICS
I* Led Him to Make Some
Odd Mistakes in
Spelling.
His "Fiiteth" Held to Mean Ten
.y Instead of a Hundred
Thousand.
Judgp Coffey Rendered a Decision in
the Famous Will Case
Yesterday.
Judge Cofley yesterday decided that
when the late Joshua Hendy wrote in his
will that Mrs. Rough and Charles Manner
should each i.aye "one-fiftieth" of the
testator's stock in the Hendy Machine
Works, he meant that the devisees should
take one-fiftieth of that stock, so these
heiiV share of the estate will amount to
410,000, in accordance with the areument
of Attorneys Hart and Yonng, and not to
$100,000 each, as was contended by Attor
ney Baggptt, who represented Mrs.
Rough. Mr. Manner made no contest, as
il was- apparently his opinion from the
start that his friend and patron Had not
intended to bestow on him a faith of the
entire estate.
During the argument yesterday Mr.
Young drew attention to the habit which
Mr. Hendy had of omitting "i" where it
should take the place of "y" in certain
words, as, for instance, busy was always
corree'ly spelled, but business was writ
ten "busness"; family was written
"famly."
Other errors in orthography noted are
as follows: Dead appear* as "ded,"
death is "detb," deDt is "det," share is
"shair," there is "thair," prepare is "pre
pair,"wereis "wair," aware is "awair,"
freight is "frait," meeting is "meatihg,
soon is "sune," scarce is "scairse," do is
"due" and doing is "dueing."
In many instances Mr. Hendy was
found to have written numbers correctly,
as J'or example he was right in spelling
five, fifty-, twenty-five, eighty-eight, twen
ty-first, third, forty, seventy-rive, three
hundred, three thousand and the like.
Anxious is often spelled "ank-.hus,"
mention is "menshun," machine (which
word one would expect Mr. Hendy to be
acquainted with in its written form) is
"mashean" and salary is "sallery.
Mr. Baggett also submitted a list of
words tha: had been incorrectly spelled by
Mr Hendy in his voluminous corre
spondence, and it was declared by the
attorney that 30 grotesque were the tes
tator's departures from the rules of â¢ r
thography that no argument could logic
ally be based on the fact that he some
times did spell some words correctly. Mr.
tfaggett insisted that Mr. Hendy intended
to give one-fifth of the machine works to
Mrs. Rough and one-fifth to Mr. Manner.
In summing up the matter Judge Cof
fey said: "My original impression was the
game as Mr. Baggett's, but subsequent
examination a:id consideration of ail tne
drcumstances before the court, and I pre
sume also a recollection of the testimony
at the contest of the will, have induced
me to depart from tnat superficial original
impression. ,
"The conclusion I have come to is tnat
the testator, Josuua Hendy, did not in
tend to nive one-fifth of his stock in the
Hendv Machine Works to this lady, Mrs.
Kougti, nor to Mr. Manner, and that this
word spelled 'one-fifteth' in tne will is in
tended to be one-fiftieth, not one-fifth.
The court further referred to the ad
mitted design of Joshua Hendy to perpet
uate bis name in the Joshua Hendy Ma
chine Works, under the control of ttie
peasons of that name. If one-fifth should
be given to Mrs. Kough and one-fafth to
Mr. Manner, the possession and control
now enjoyed by the members of the Hendy
family would be disturbed and probably
would cease.
This decision by Judge Coffey means a
great deal to the estate. If he had held
that Mr 3. Rough and Mr. Manner were

John J. Feeny's seat in the State Senate

filed yesterday.
Fred Lundquist has filed a contest

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20. 1896.
Ti^e Mushroom Cellar to
Become a Fashionable Fad
To be fashionable nowadays raise mush
rooms in your cellar. This is the edict
that has been promulgated by the mis
tress of all thing 3 social. Fashion has de
cided to take lessons from nature and in
stead of botanizing throughout the rural
districts in the most charming time of the
year will turn her attention to the meth
ods of growing that most succulent of ad
ditions to the porterhouse steak during
the winter season.
It is a brand-new idea, so far as the
mansions of wealth and culture are con
cerned. Heretofore the cellars have been
supposed to be floored with cement and
the temperature kept at a comfortable de
gree when the weather outside was of tnat
nature which calls for heavy overcoats.
Now, however, all this is changed. Mush
rooms must be grown in cold cellars, and
hence all cellars must be cold. ThiÃ new
departure is not the result of mere theory
or faddist notion of some one who seeks
to be odd and thus conspicuous, but is
fathered by no less a personage than
David Fraser of Mahwah, N. J., an au
thority on gardening, whose wora is not
to be disputed.
Mr. Fraser says there is absolutely noth
ing to hinder the growth of mushrooms in
cellars, and that for his part he thinks it
is a very excellent idea indeed. The air
must be dry in the cellar, and the tem
perature on no account allowed to fall
befow 24 degrees. "I grew a fine crop of
mushrooms in my cellar last winter," says
Mr. Fraser. "Out of a bed 23 leet long
and 4 feet wide I picked between 90 and
100 pounds of the finest mushiooms,
weighing them after the stems were cut
off. The bed was made up on the 27th of
November. The house was kept very dry
that is to say no water was allowed to spill
on the floor while we were watering the
bed.
"Beds in the cellar do not need a great
deal of water. I only watered mine after
each top dressing, but when I did water it
I gave it a good dose, using a fine spray
for the purpose. If the cellar is large a
good way to do is to put a load of hot fer
tilizer on the floor, for this raises a nice
moist heat. Next winter I mean to keep
a load of it on the floor of my cellar all the
time, renewing it as the heat declines. In
cold cellars very little air is needed before
the warm days of spring come. Then I
give plenty of ;t.
"If the fertilizer becomes too dry for
making the beds in the cellar don't be
afraid to put the hose on it, as fertilizer is
not nearly as good dry as moist. I always
give each barrelful of fertilizer a pail of
water and this seems to make it right. Be
sure when you pick a crop to pick it clean.
If there are any dead mushrooms pick
them out by the roots, then top dress the
bed."
Ttiis is advice that the fashionable per
son with a cellar may take to heart and
know that he or she has the knowledge
necessary to become thoroughly in keep
ing with the latest style. For the days
when style was confined to garments and
house furnishings are gone. There is,
style to everything, even to sidewalks.
Style long ago penetrated the garret, but
now it has reached the cellar, and the
mushroom is its representative.
From time immemorial it has been con
sidered very proper to deride anybody and
everybody whom custom dubbed of the
mushroom aristocracy. The new fad has
put an end to all this. In the future to be
a mushroom aristocrat will be considered
as equivalent to a position on the crest of
the wave of social fitness.
Of course everybody has had vegetables
in their cellars these many years, but to
grow them there is auch an exceeding
novelty that its popularity is insured. To
be sure, the fertilizer was at first consid
ered a drawback, but as fashion exacts
many sacrifices from her devotees this
was a matter hardly worthy of considera
tion.
While everybody who knows anything
at all about eating is thoroughly familiar
with the delicious addition to various
things that the mushroom makes, com
paratively few of us realize what an art
there is in growing mushrooms, in bring
ing them to the right condition and thor
oughly ready ior the skilliul hands of the
chef. In the first place, to raise mush
j rooms it is necessary to secure what is
! known as spawn. Mushrooms bear no re
lation whatever to fish, but in a virgin
state they have the same name as the tiny
fellows that fill the tanks at the fish hatch-
cries.
A host of people over in England and
France make their living by producing
! the mushroom spawn, and large quantities
I are imported to ihe United States every
| year. It is just as necessary to procure
| good spawn, if it is intended to raise
mushrooms, as it is to procure a pug dog
puppy of good blood if it is desired that
he present the best appearance when he
arrives at the age of maturity.
Think of the change this cellar plan
makes for the mushroom. The web
fringe variety is mostly found in the
I woods, where it grows from or about
I stumps or decaying roots in the ground.
Frequently great clusters protrude from
around the base of posts. There are sev
eral species of the web-fringe. Their cat.s
are from one to six inches across. They
are showy and easily recognized. In sub
stance they are solid and white or yellow
ish in color. People who do not know
them do not lite them, and that is a case
where ignorance is not bliss.
The wise man or woman will cat the
caps to pieces after washing and stew or
bake with bread crumbs for half an hour.
When this is done and the result thereof
is seasoned and a little lemon juice is
added, or sherry or madeira, there is a
feast fit for the gods. This is one of the
sort ot mv brooms tnat will flourish in
the cold cellar of the follower of lashion.
Then there is the variety with a long
name, the Coprinarii. They are as tender
and toothsome as a tenderloin steak. An
other variety Is the little brown-capped,
slender-stem Coprinus Micaceus (that is
all the name it has), whose tops frequently
glisten a 9 if sprinkled with fine mica.
This is a gem, too. It makes a rich, black
dish after ten minutes' stewing. When
once the person of fashion is inoculated
with the virus of this sort of mushroom
eating all gratitude, friendship, even fam
ily ties, vanish, and he or she will race for
an edible mushroom if but seen through
a telescope.
The maned mushroom is often eaten
under the name of truffle, and it, too, can
be made a product of the cold cellar,
down in the depths of the society man
sion. Those who have eaten them most
say that no cheaper or more effectual
spree is by nature provided. Other varie
ties that can be grown in the cellar are the
mushrooms of the order of hydnei, as the
producers call them. They have teeth-like
protuberances upon which the mushroom
caps are born. Then there are the po
lyporie, those good old Greek fellows, that
taste just as luscious as they did in those
far-away days when Lucullus ate them
in a savory stew under his own vine and
fig tree.
Speaking of stews, the man or woman
whoso mind is bent on a cellar bed of
mushrooms should never forget the clav
arerei. The name has something of a for
midable appearance, but, then, what's in
a name anyway? Certainly it does not
affect th 6 taste. This is an odd variety of
mushroom in appearance, for it branches
out like deer horns. The individuality is
very clear, for nothing else that grows
could look like it. And as lor stews, they
have no superior.
Thus it is, for once at least, to be in
fashion means to possess one of the most
pleasant adjuncts of a very inviting meal.
No- one has yet discovered whether the
new fad is to be given the Vanderbiltian
approval or the sanction of the Astors.
In fact it is of so recent popularity in
Eastern social circles that it is rather diffi
cult as yet to name the principals in the
company of players on life's stage who
will give it their unqualified indorsement.
Chauncey M. Depew is notably in favor of
it, and what Mr. Depew doesn't know
about good things to eat it is not worth
any one's whiie to consider.
The mushroom fad will not down. It
has come to stay. Dame Fashion says so,
and inasmuch as the king can do no
wrong, surely the queen is equally infal
lible. â¢

On Wednesday last Ihe Call published
in its local columns, and merely as a mat
ter of news, the complaint of Alfred Isson,
addressed to the President, making
charges against Hon. H. S. Foote, the
United Siates District Attorney. Thk
Call did not vouch for the truth of any ol
the charges preferred, nor give its sanc
tion to the criticism of the District Attor
ney. Three indictments were pending
against George Stierlen for sending ob
scene matter through the mails. Stierlen
was allowed to plead guilty to one indict
ment and was heavily fined hy Jttdjra
Morrow; tbe other two indictments were
nolle prosed, or dismissed. An investiga
tion of the facts shows that the action of
the District Attorney and the disposition
of the Stierlen cases instead of being the
subject of adverse criticism were emi
nently just and proper.
A VICTORY FOR DECENCY.
The Call congratulates the public and the respectable press of California that
their united effort has resulted in driving the Examiner back to a semblance of decency
for the time being at least. It has been several days since Mr. Hearst's newspaper
â¢has printed an obscene cartoon, and almost a week since an erotic sensation has been
flashed up from its favorite slums. It has even abstained from detailing women
reporters to interview the several prize-fighters in town or to report the daily pro
ceedings of the Morgue. The fact that the usual amount of that sort of matter which
has heretofore caused the Examiner* columns to "shine like a rotten mackerel
by moonlight," to use John Randolph's suggestive comparison, has been omitted for
the past few days, is causing wide comment among that element of society which
desires its omission. Those who have watched the progress of the battle for
decency are exultant in the hope of victory, and rejoice to see the swaggering bully
and boastful braggart of California journalism ior once obliged to succumb to the
power of an aroused and indienant public opinion.
It may be possible that this temporary relapse into respectability is due to the
fact that for the past few days the already overworked "fake and fiction" department
of the Examiner has had its entire energies absorbed in the manufacture of that pre
posterous slander on the proprietor of The Call with the publication of which the Ex
aminer has made itself ridiculous to the puDlic eye. The Call is, however,
inclined to take a more hopeful view of the situation, and for the present, at least, to
assume that the Examiner has been cowed into decency by the storm of indignant
protests and the lash of deserved rebuke which has been rained upon it recently, and
that for a little while it will be sufficiently respectable to avoid a repetition of tbe
punishment it has just received.
If this hope shall prove to be correct, The Call, in common with its brethren
among the respectable daily and weekly press of California, will have ample reason
for public congratulation upon the notable victory they have won. In view of the
lact that a long career as a braggadocio or a lengthened indul
gence in depravity usually require more than a single treatment to
reduce the pride or restore the system of either a man or a newspaper, it ma> be nec
essary to administer to the Examiner further treatment, in order to its complete
restoration to decency. Thk Call, in company with its associates among reputable
newspapers, will therefore stand ready with all the proper appliances to renew the
heroic treatment of the past fortnight whenever the Examiner displays the slightest
tendency to relap c into its recent condition as the exponent of nastiaess in journal
ism upon the Pacific Coast.
CALIFORNIA IN THE CABINET.
That California deserves a place in the
Cabinet of the next administration and of
right ought to have it is the universal
opinion of the people of the State. There
has teen a general satisfaction in the
prospects that such a position would be
awarded to a Californian, and until re
cently tnere was no evidence of any out
break of personal antagonism or hostili
ties that would lend to prevent it.
It is to be hoped such signs of personal
antagonism as have appeared do not repre
sent a strong feeling in any quarter.
There is no reason why dissensions should
break out over the subject. We have had
abundant experience in the past to show
that Californians are always able to de
feat one another in their aspirations for
high offices in the councils of the Nation.
It is certain, therefore, we can defeat one
another again if we seek to do so. It re
mains with ourselves to decide whether
we shall follow the old cutthroat policy,
and prevent any Californian from finding
a place in the McKJnley Cabinet, or
whether we shall unite and work together
to secure that position for some man who
will reflect credit upon the administration
ana upon the State.
That the Republican party of California
contains many men well worthy of the
.high honor of a seat in the Cabinet is not
to be doubted. Among the men who
have been recommended there are several
who would ably serve the people and il
lustrate the capacity of Californians for
dealing with great National issues and
problems. The Call has no special favor
ites among these. It does not assume to
dictate to the party nor claim the
right to name the men who are to have
the honors ot the great victory achieved
by the effective work of all Republicans
acting together in harmony throughout
the State. Thk Call has no council but
that of harmony. If Republicans of Cali
fornia cannot agree upon any one man for
a Cabinet position let them recommend
three or four and leave it to President Mc-
Kinley to choose from amoni; them.
Such men as Horace Davis, Judpe de
Haven, Mr. Elwood Cooper, Judge â Way
mire and others who might be named are
certainly men whom the Republicans of
Caliiornia could well unite in recommend
ing for appointment to tbe Cabinet. Each
of them is a man who has been tried in
many important tasks, and in both public
and in piivate life has proven himjelf to
be capable, faithful and trustworthy.
Let us bear in mind the issue before us
is not to advance the interests of any par
ticular man, but to cain for California a
representative in the Cabinet. >Ye
know from past experience what has been
the result of our local dissensions. Let us
now mark the beginning of a new era iv
politics by overcoming these dissensions
and winning for California the recognition
which she deserves in the highest council
of the Nation.
THE IDEAL NEWSPAPER
The movement recently started in Now
York among ministers and religious
organizations proposing a boycott against
sensational Sunday newspapers and the
establishment of an ideal newspaper,
while perhaps somewhat visionary and
not directed with sufficient concentration
of aim to that evil in newspapers which
should be and can be cured, is exceedingly
well timed and will no doubt accomplish
much in the way of reform.
The principal error in this training of
the guns of righteousness is that they are
pointed indiscriminately at all Sunday
newspapers. The ammunition thus
directed will be wasted, for the Sunday
paper has come to stay. It is a necessity
of modern civilization. L?t vile papers be
opposed and also the portion of evil that
mingles in papers partially good, and the
war may be as Grant waged it instead of a
Quixotic tilt. We have reached a stage of
progress wherein the news is needed
"every day and Sunday, too." The
preacher who would be lorceful and
timely must know when he enters his
pulpit what is the latest news.
ThÂ« efforts of ministers and religious
organizations to cripple clean Sunday
papers, if effective, would but remove an
influence which may be made to accom
plish great pood, and by this removnl
give redoubled opportunity for scandalous
sheets to corrupt society. Let the clean
paper be encouraged and the foul one
condemned if tbe preachers and tbe
public wish to do some practical good in
the world. Now is an opportune time to
get in this effective work, for the people
are nauseated with the viieness of the
"new journalism." and the tendency to
reaction should be given momentum by a
push forward from every man and
woman who wishes prurient literature
kept out of their homes.
It has been said the first issue of the
"ideal newspaper" would be published on
tbe morning of the millennium; and this
is, of course, true in the sense that perfec
tion is not attainable in a state of exist
ence in which evil is ever present with
us. A Sunday paper, however, can have
its pases full of matter that will entertain,
enlighten, encourage and make more
moral and happy thousands of people
who have little time to read except on
that day. It reaches many who will not
go to churcb and who do not read books.
For these tbe newspaper can supply not
only the latest news, which th|y are
bound to read, bat also the instruction
required by intelligent and refined readers
in the way of literary beauties, science,
art and exploration.
There are many most excellent Sunday
newspapers published in this country, as
every fair-minded man knows. Nothing
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 189 ft.
can be gained for the cause of morality by
denunciations which coniound these with
sheets utterly disreputable and wholly
vile. If the pulpit is to help on the com
ing of the ideal newspaper it must dis
tinguish between the good and the evil
which exist, and support the one while
condemning the other.
Public sentiment is now well prepared
to co-operate with the church in the fight
against that vicious portion of the press
which i-eeks to degrade journalism to the
slums and spread the emanations of the
slums into every home. This fact is made
manifest by the war now being waged in
New York against the Journal of that city
and in San Francisco against the Ex
aminer. The promoters of the movement
for an ideal newspaper will therefore have
powerful allies among all classes of decent
people if they direct their war rightly.
There must be no firing in the air. Let
the advocates of decent journalism brand
the vicious by name and hold them up to
the scorn and contempt of the virtue they
have mocked at and the decency they
have outraged.
CUBAN INDEPENDENCE.
The action of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations in unanimously adopt
ing a decision to report to the Benate a
joint resolution recognizing the inde
pendence of Cuba brings us to a crisis in
our relations with the war now raging in
that island. As soon as the report of the
committee is made to the Senate that
body, the highest in the great councils of
the Nation, and specifically charged by
the constitution to act with the I'resident
in all foreign affairs, will have to decide
one way or another what course it shall
take toward Spain and toward the
Cubans.
The resolutions adopted by the commit
tee declare in the first section that the
Congress of the United States recognises
the independence of the Republic of
Cuba, and in the second section that tho
United States will use its friendly offices
with the Government of Spain to bring to
a close the war between Spain and Cuba.
If the Senate adopts this resolution it
will remain for the House of Representa
tives to decide whether Mr. Cleveland
shall be left free in his policy of inactivity,
or shall be forced either to take action in
recognition of Cuban independence, or
defy the will of tne Congress of his own
country.
That the American people are willing
and ready to acknowledge the independ
ence of Cuba is beyond all question. If
such recognition would be of any benefit
to the Cubans the people will support it
cordially. It is more than doubtful, how
ever, whether such action on our part
would be in the least decree helpful to the
patriots of the island. If it did not em
broil us with Spain, its effect would be
wholly moral. It would give the Cubans
the right to equip privateers and bring
their prizes into our ports provided the
Cubans were able to equip vessels of that
kind. It would not, however, give them
a right to have such warships constructed
at our shipyards, ncr would it give them
the right to supply their ships with the
munitions of war at auy port in this coun
try.
While the benefits to Cuba of our recog
nition of her independence would be prob
lematical, the disadvantage to ourselves
would be certain. We would lose the
right of holding the Spanish Government
responsible for all damage done to Ameri
can property in the island, and we would
also lose the right of shipping munitions
of war to the Cuban- patriots. These facts
are well understood in Congress, and they
will go far to make the House hesitate to
adopt the resolutions, even if they should
pass the Senate. As was said by a leading
member of the House Committee on
Foreign Relations, the Senate has ceased
to be the conservative branch of Congress,
and we must look to the House for pro
tection against rash action of any kind.
The independence of Cuba is the desire
of the American people. They are willing
to do much to bring it about. A con
siderable number of them are even willing
to engage in war with Spain for that
purpose. Nevertheless, we believe there
are few who are willing to take risks of war
at this time. The existing administration
will soon go out of office, and in every re
spect it would be better for Congress to
leave the incoming administration free to
act as may be best when it begins its
work. For that reason if for no other we
believe public sentiment will be averse to
any hasty action at this time. Congress
should leave the question to the decision
of the incoming administration, and then,
if conditions justify it, the country will
cordially support the new President in
taking any action he may deem necessary
to establish the independence of Cuba,
even at the risk of a war with Spain.
ROBERT BURNS
The proposal of the Caledonian Club to
erect a monument to Robert Burns in
Golaen Gate Park is one that will be sure
to receive the warm approval of the great
majority of the people of San Francisco.
It will go hard with the proposal indeed if
it does not receive- something more than
approval. The club ought to find gener
ous assistance from all citizens, and the
monument should be made an evidence of
the appreciation in which Burns is held
by the community as a whole, and not
merely by tbose of our people who are of
Scotch birth or ancestry.
Robert Burns has earned for himself the
proud title of "The Poet of Humanity."
All who love poetry recognize the justice
of his claim to t; at rank among the
mighty masters of song. What he did for
Scotland was great, but what he did for
the world at large was greater still. He
has long ceased to be regarded as the poet
of the Scottish people exclusively. He is
the singer of the universal song of the
human heart and is everywhere esteemed
as the poet of all mankind.
Though an alien to the land of Califor
nia Robert Burns is not an alien to tbe
hearts of its people. Much of the joy and
happiness of life with us, as well as life iv
Scotland, has been due to the sweet songs
he wrote and the sentiments of love,
charity and friendship which he expressed
in "thoughts that breathe and words that
burn." We owe to him more than we can
give, and the erection of a monument in
his honor amid the groves of our park
would be le*3 a tribute to his memory
than an expression of our own apprecia
tion of what is finest and truest in
human character.
The people of California are In the full
est sense ot the word "heirs of all the
ages. 1 ' .We may also claim to be heirs of
all countries, of all climes and of all
genius. In the building up of our cities
and the cultivation of our fields men from
all parts of the world have come and
taken part In our social organism has
been infused the best thoughts of the best
men of all nations. We owe a debt to
Dante, to Racine, to Goethe, to Shakes
peare, to Moore and to Burns. That debt
it would not be inappropriate to pay by
the erection of monuments in our park.
No right thinking man will consider such
monuments alien to our social life or to
our institutions.
The people of San Francisco can with
the truest patriotism unite with the Cale
donian Club in carrying out to a success
ful accomplishment tbe task which the
club proposes to undertake. We cannot
have too much of art in our City nor show
too much appreciation of true genius,
wherever it may have lived. Robert Burns
is one of tbe singers whom we honor in
every household and in every heart, and
there is no reason why we should not give
in our parts a visible manifestation of the
esteem in which we hold h'rn.
THE CHRISTMAS "CALL."
The Christmas Call will appear on
Christmas morning and will be one of the
bright features of that happy holiday in
every home to which it comes. In every
respect it will be a genuine California pa
per, and will bear in its bright and inter
esting pages suggestions of the good cLeer
which accords with the celebration of the
great festival.
The publication of the paper on Christ
mas day itself will make it more truly a
holiday paper than if it appeared this
morning. Moreover, tbe pressure of news,
advertising and stories requires us to issue
it separately from the Sunday number, in
order to do justice to ourselves, our read
ers and to the public.
It goes without saying the number will
be equal to any newspaper publication of
the year. It will be a Christmas gift in
itself of no small merits or proportions.
Look out for It. Leave orders for it.
Every home in California ought to glad
den itself with a copy of the Christmas
Call,

THE KANSAS COW AND KANSAS
HEN.
Kmporla (Kan.) Gazette.
All lands agree that outside capital is not
available just now, and many good business
people think it is undesirable. But there are
ways out op?n. One of these ways is tbe Kan
sas cowpaui. That will lead to glory quicker
than the Legislature can lead the wuy. The
Kansas cow, if she is worked, will pay off the
National debt quicker than any Legislature.
Trainload after train load of butter leaves
Newton every month for New York, where it
is shipped directly to London. That train
should leave every Kansas county betweea
Great Bend and the Missouri River. It would
distribute more money per capita in Kansas
than "the free and unlimited coinage of silver
at the legal and constitutional ratio of 1(5 to
1." It would bring as much money into Lyon
County in a year as the Santa Fe Railroad
shops brine if the farmers of this community
would get the milk to market. Tbere is more
money In the Kansas cow than there is in
pearls and diamonds.
The Kansas heu can payoff the Kansas mort
gage easier than a tariff bill or a silver bill.
There will be a tariff on eggs, and the Cana
dian-hen will be in the hands ot a receiver.
The Kansas hen eggs will be served on the
bteakfast tab'.e of the Palmer House in Cnt
cago and the Fifth Avenue fn New York. The
Kansas hen will bring in more money than
the Kansas steer. The thing to do Is to culti
vate tbe hen.
Then when toe hen and the cow are running
on full time, the thing to do is to get a patch
of garden and "tend it." There is pood money
in these things and good times are coming
are here. Men are going to work in all the
shops in the Central Middle States. These
men are going to eat canned corn and canned
"tomatuses" aud canned beans. Let'em eat
Kansas truck. It will pay.
A CANDIDATE WITH A CON
SCIENCE.
Chicago Chronicle.
"All's fair In love, war and politics" has
long been a maxim well followed, but H. D.
Flood, who was declared by the Virginia State
Board of Canvassers to have been elected to
Congress from the Tenth District, has refused
to accept his certificate. His opponent was
Jacob Yost, whose name appeared upon some
of the ballots as "J. YoÂ«t," thus ffivlng Mr.
Flood & technical plurality. He haÂ» deter
mined not to take advantage of this error, and
a new election will therefore have to be held
in order to choose a representative. It iÂ« so
seldom that such fairness is exhibited under
the stress of political excitement that it is
worthy of especial mention.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
D. K. B. Sellers, a prominent merchant of
Eureka, Cal., is here on business, aud is at the
Grand. He said last night, in reference to Lis
section :
"It is a fact that while the San Francisco
merchants, daily press and citizens of the
lower counties have ofttimes exhibited a doubt
as to whether Eureka, Humboldt County, was
located in the State of Oregon or Washington,
it remained for The Call to take the initiative
step and geographically locate us as being a
part of the glorious State of California. Grati
tude is surely due it for the veiy interesting
and able way in which it has written uo our
resources, our people and our wants.
"It is also true that the county has directly
felt the advantages of this attention which
The Call has given us. Already a projected
railroad is under survey by the Iron Mountain
Mining Company from Red Bluff to Eureka,
and scarcely a steamer leaves San Francisco
for Eureka, without au adventurous miner
aboard, anxious to cast his lot among us and
try his luck in the placer mines along the
Klamath and Trinity rivers.
â¢â¢Without a doubt the gold-mining industry
of Humboldt will shortly equal the good days
in Trinity County, and the county will be one
of the largest gold producing territories of the
State. Tne fact is, very few of our mines have
as yet been developed. However, the coming
winter promises some big surprises to the
people of this State.
"Eureka will be the natural supply point.
Although only trails now lead out in the direc
tion of the mines, the people of the county
shortly contemplate building good, substantial
wagon roade. A combination of circumstances
will at times stagnate our lumber industry,
but with the development of the gold mines,
we can see permanent prosperity.
"Salmon fishing and duck shooting are some
of our principal sports. We now have several
thousand acres in preserves; a sporting club of
twenty, limited, ,and a well equipped club
house to entertain our city friends. Even the
little suckers are now looking to Alex Vogel
sang lor protection. And with the prospect of
sending Billie Foote to the United States
Senate in four years, my friend Cutler and I
are reconciled to eat crow for several years."

Pick-Me-Up.BARING-GOULD AND HIS WORKS
"ftichard Gable" Is the OiMy Book He En
joyed Writingâ Says It is His Best.
SOME EJWOYJIBLE RE.MI.NISCE.NCES OF TJiE OTTJIOR
The Novtel jKat Wor\ Him Fame Brought Him Only Fifty founds.
HoW His Kr\ack of Hvjmrv-Writirxg Gost Him a
E. D. Baring-Gould, son of the popnlar
Eaelish author, S. Baring-Gould of Dev
onshire, is full of reminiscences of his
famous father, all of which are interesting
and some amusing. He says his father,
who vras a minister, had a rough time in
literature before he made it go. The
manuscript of the book that won him
fame, and which had an enormous sale,
he had to hawk about from publisher to
publisher, all refusing to take it. Said
Mr. Baring-Gould:
"Finally he sold the copyright for Â£50,
or $250. This was for "Mehalah," the
book by which he achievea his success.
It had a tremendous circulation, running
through several editions. Since then he
has refused to sell the copyright of any
of h\i books.
"But the book that my father thinks is
tho best, and the only one he says he en
joyed writing, is "ilichard Cable." He
enjoys the religious and antiquarian, and
not novel writine. His novels pay exceed
ingly well. He generally writes a history
for his own pleasure, and a novel for the
pleasure of his purse.
"The work I enjoy most of all he has
written is 'The Tragedy of the Caesars.'
Before writing it he studied chronologi
cally the great men around whom the
story clings. He went to Rome and stud
ied the busts and read the history of the
men. Studying them thus he has brought
out how they were likely to act, and in
many cases lias represented the characters
in i light contrary to Gibbon.
"For instance, he toofc Tiberius, a man
supposed to be almost infamous, but he
has shown him to be really an excellent
man, only a little too weak for the circum-
Btances which surrounded him. In the
same way he has taken up others of the
Caesars.
"My father is now writing a 'Life of St.
Paul', and also a 'Life of Christ' This is
quite a departure from nov.el writing. He
will visit Palestine in the spring and get
the local color. He will only need to stay
a few weeks at most.
"He is now living at our place in Devon
shire. It is an old place that we have had
in our family for about 500 years.
"He writes hymns, too, as well as his
tories and novels. He wrote the hymn,
'Onward, Christian Soldiers,' and in con
nection with that I will tell you a story.
At the time he was curate of a small
church. He had intended to use it as a
processional hymn, but the* Bishop would
not allow it.
"The Bishop was Jew chnrch and my
father was high church, and the Bishop
opposed the sign of the cross that was to
be used. My father told him that it was
pretty late to change the hymn now, or
to write a new one, but if he insisted on it
he would do the best he could. Well, the
Bishop said there was no use talking
about it. He couldn't have the hymn in
troduced as originally intended. It was
contrary to his idea of what the church
would stand.
"The first verse of the hymn reads, as
you no doubt remember:
: Onward, Christian soldiers, â¢
: Marching on to war, :
: With the cross of Jesus ;
: Going on before.
"But my father changed the last line,
'Going on bffcre,' to 'Left behind the
door,' so that when the clioir walked for
ward they got no farther tnan the door
with the cross, and chanted as they came
forward in procession:
: Onward, Christian sr ldlers, !
; Marching on to war, !
: With the cross of Jesus ;
Left behind tbe door.
â¢â¢This made the Biabop very mad and
he dismissed my father from that living.
But as some friends of my father wrote
soon after, they guessed he could stand it
very well, for Mr. Gladstone gave him a
very much better living in Essex.
"And strange to say in less than a month
from that time the song was nut in the
Episcopal hymnbook. My father still
acts as clergyman at Lew Trenchard in
Devonshire. That is where his place is.
"He has never been in America. He is
too poor a sailor. The only long sea trip
he ever took was to Iceland, but it was so
hard on him that he has feJt very loth to
trust himself to the waves again."
The first book the elder Barir.g-Gould
wrote was called "Iceland." He next
wrote "The Book of Werewolves"; "Past
Medieval Preachers" followed, and then
he wrote "The Origin and Development
of Religious Belief." "Lives of the
Saints'' and "Some Modern Difficulties"
led down to "Mehalah," the book which
achieved such phenomenal success, and
the copyright of which, according to the
son, was sold for a song.
FINELY FINISHED.
DUBT IN THE BALANCEâ By George Knight.
B. F. Fenne A Co., New York. Price $1 25.
Nineteen sketches in one volume, all finely
polished by a literary iapidary who knows
well when he has found a gem of an idea how
to cut it down to symmetry and make it flash
â  and sparkle, in this work of George Knight's
give the reader ample variety ot pathos,
humor and wit. Short stories are now having
their day, and they are said to be more diffi
cult to write than long ones. What is wanted
â  by many is a literary treat whicli can bo en
joyed in fifteen minutes, or half an hour, and
then let them back to work again without too
much reluctance. When a Ion? story is really
good it is difficult to find within it stopping
places where one can feel satisfied to pass from
its delights to pull up against the collar of the
duties we are hitched to. From the tempta
tion to stay with a book too long the short
story saves us, and this collection can be rec
ommended to those who love a good story but
whose leisure is too brief for a long one.
The story of Sir Folly, the King's fool, is a
good one to sample the book with, and those
who read it will want some more from the
same mind. The Jester leads off in this
trajedy by stabbing the profligate son of the
King with his keen wit. The Prince's revenge
is to ruin a peasant girl and then mockingly
say to the noble jester, "You said all women
were your sisters " The next stab of the
jester is done with steel, and on. the haft of
the .knife as it remains in the breast so false a
poem is impaled by Sir Folly ere he flees. The
motto used for this tale is the well-known sen
tence which we are told in the Old Testament
the brothers of Dinah uttered in explana
tion of their revenge. Most of the mottoes are
taken from the Bible and are very apt.
One of the cleverest in the book is the ap
propriately named 41 Tantalus." It tells of ft
"Living" as a Gleric.
successful bachelor novelist who, after having
created a number of heroines from the finest
fancies of his brain and fallen in love with
them, flings his pen down iv disgust one day
when the thought comes to him of how futile
it is to be making these glorious women for
other fellows to marry. Then being weary he
sleeps and dreams. The vision of a sweet
little woman enters and declares she is his
ideal. "And shall I never meet you as a
reality?" asks the novelist. "If I were real I
would not be myseif, " says tho lady, and
when the novelist sought -to kiss her on the
mouth the ideal woman was gone.
FATE'S FREAKS.
BOME WHIMS OF FATKâ By Menle Muriel

and New York. Price $1. For sale by William
Doxey, Palace Hoiel. City.
Of the five short stories here published to
gether two have been printed in the Yellow
Book and one in Chambers' Journal. Perhaps
the best ol the collection is "Wladislaw's Ad
vent." This is an odd story of a Polish stu
dent of paintinu. His face had a strong re
semblance to the ideals of the old masters as
shown in their representation* of Christ, A
famous artist in Paris employed him as a model
to be used in a great painting he had planned
of the Temptation of Christ. This artut had
mode his fame as a portraitist of the "lilies de
joie," and it was a surprise to his brother art
ists that he should conceive it possible to add
to his reputation by painting the Man of Sor
rows. The would-bo painter of the Nazarene
seems to have been a man much given to yield
ing to temptation, and his studio was fre
quented by the frail beauties who have formed
the subjects ot his famous canvases.
After taking a number of preliminary
sketches of the Pole's face the artist engaged
him to come at a certain hour the next Sun
day night to pose for the picture which is to
be the great effort of his life. Ai the ap
pointed hour Wladislaw went to the studio,
but before seeing the painter he entered the
dressing-room to don the simple white wool
garment In which he was to pose. He heard
sounds of wild revelry, but supposed they
came from the adjoining studio of a sculptor.
He supposed the artist, Dufour, who had en
gaged him, was busy on his great picture, as
he drew the curtain back at the entrance to
Dufour's room he beheld a crowd of â¢ half
drunk men and women at their revels- Du
four raises a wavering arm, and with a
drunken smile of intelligence exclaimed, "Ah,
it is my Jesus Christ!" The sudden shock of
tne words and the sight of the strange figure
in white garment sent a thrill of terror
through tlie crowd. The apparition vras soon
understood, but never after could the revelers
"iorget the stun of that terrible moment
when, at the jarring scrape of the curtain
rings upon their rod, the white figure of the
Christ had interrupted themâ wnen it had
seemed, indeed, that the last day had come,
that judgment and retribution had overtaken
them."
TOLD BY A NAVAL COMMANDER.
THE SHIP'S COMPANY, and Other Sea PeoDle.
ay i. D. Jerrold Kelly, U. S. N. New York:
Harner & Bros. Price *1 50. ior sale by a.
il. Robertson, Post stre.c, City.
The fascination of the sea is increased and
curiosity about it gratified by these eight ex
cellently written sketches of life aboard ship.
There are graphic descriptions of what life is
like on board of a man-of-war, a costly pleas
ure-yacht and the great, swift passenger
steamer, from the lookout in the fore top down
to the stifling stokehole. Lieutenant-Com
mander Kelly is thoroughly familiar with his
subject, and has a breezy and salty way of
telling things relating to travel over the briny
deep. The book is profusely illustrated with
full-page pictures, one of which, representing
a young boy "Going Aloft," is especially fine.
In these pages we get acquainted with the
ship's company, and among them are taught
to sincerely admire the type of purser ana doc
tor, who are highly commended for the un
failing courtesy with which, in spite of being
hourly harried with the hundred little miser
ies of other people, they go cheerily about
their business. About the superstitions of the
sailori we read with wonder, and there is
thrilling interest in the "Spirit of Limbogen,"
which is a tale of ocean heroism and disaster
and final rescue by the operation of some oc
cult agency.
Boys who wish to join the navy and their
friends who take an interest in their career
wiil here find much about midshipmen, old
and new. The "Klgor of the Game" tells of
the stern discipline of the sailor's life and how
bravely he bears it; but the hardship is shown
to be a mere trifle compared to the brutalities
which had to be borne in former days when
flogging was common for minor faults and for
great ones the horrible kee- hauling was in
flicted.
Best of all, perhaps, is the amusing descrip
tion of the "Queer Pets of Sailor Jack." Over
the portrayal of the pet pig, Dennis O'Kerry,
who was so well beloved by the sailors that
they coulo. not possibly eat him, the reader
may laugh till he grows as fat as Dennis got
on the rum and other good things the sailors
shared with him. Uis name was Dennis, but
fortune smiled upon him.
NEGRO TYPES.
SOLOMON CROW'S CHRIRTMAS POCKKTS
and other talesâ By fiuih McKneiy Stunrt.
Harper Bros,, New YoÂ»k. Price $1 25. For
sa : e by A. M. Kobms, Post street, Ci:y.
New Orleans and Its vicinity is the scene of
these ten short stories which deal mainly with
negro types. The first one relates now a kind
lady developed the nobleness in a little negro
boy so that from a rogue he became trust
worthy. He had benn iorbidden the use of
pockets by his employer ana he felt the degra
dation keenly. When Christmas came and his
lady benefactress asked what he would like
for his gift, he eagerly begged for Dockets. A
whole outfit of them vrere given him ln a fine
suit of clothes and the black boy ever after
considered pockets a great tiust and never
again purloined anything.
In the story called "Blink," which tells of a
young girl's struggle to support her infirm
father, there is a criticism made by her old
black "mammy" which is worth noting. The
girl is trying to write stories and the old
woman is very anxious to help her, saying she
had never craved education before. "Look ter
me, baby," mammy suggested another night,
after listening to a highly imaginative storyâ
"look ter me like efâ eiâ ef you's dcs write
down some truly truth what is acâ chilly
happened, an' glorify it wid education, hit 'd
dcs nachelly stan' in a book." The next story
was written under the old woman's directions
and it was a success.
The story called "Quackftlina" is very pa
thetic. Quackalina was a duck. Thj farm
er's boy took the eggs out of her nest and put
a lot of guinea eggs under her, which she
hatched out, but when she looked at their
feet and saw that they would never swim "it
was a great shock to her." The book ends
with a pretty poem called "May Be So."

thinks it worth while to fascinate the youth.
Although she doea not love the handsome boy

tion for this fair and wily woman the hot

an army officer. He boldly iusults the officer
and forces him to fight a duel. T;ie descrip

STRANGE STORIES.
THE DE>IRF. OF THE EYKS-Bv Grnnt Allen.
R. F. Fenne &C o , New York. Price $1 25.
"The Desire of the Eyes" is the tirst of a
collection of thirteen rather commonplace
stories, and is bo much better than some of
the others it probably deserves the honor of
giving its name to the whole bunch. In it the
hero displays a noble loyalty to a girl who
loved him, but offers to give him up be cause
she had become disfigured by smallpox. The
general heading through the book is Strange
Stories, and some of them will mate strangely
disagreeable reading to any Southern white
man who might attempt their dull pages,
however much they might please mulattoes
and such whites as can contemplate mis
cegenation without disgust. As tastes differ
it may be fairest to give an extract of the
style in one of the stories in which he tells of
a fine handsome English girl falling in love
with and marrying a full-blooded negro from
Africa: "To say tho truth, John Creely, in
spite of his black face, dazzled poor Ethel, for
he was more of a scholar and a gentleman
than anybody with whom she had ever before
REV. S. BARING-GOULD.
had the chance of conversing." "And after all,
John Creely was in all essentials an educated
English gentleman, with the sumo chivalrous
feelings toward a pretty and attractive girl
that every Englishman ousrht to have." "And
Ethel really did to some extent love him
already." There is another tale almost as dis
agreeable of a love affair between a white girl
and a heathen Chinee, but this one was miti
gated somewhat by having the love strictly
platonic. It is well 'o recognize that goodness
and greatness and heroism can dwell beneath
skins of all colors, but when it comes to tell
ing of love between the sexes, where English
ana American girls feel tne tender passion for
negroes and Chinese, the subject is too dfs
guiting for fiction founded on it to be com*
mended.

LEVOUT FICTION.
SIC VITA ESTâ By Sue Freeman Matthews.
G. W. Dillingham <fc Co., New York. Price $1 6a
For sale by the San Francisco News Company,
Market street.
This is a good story. It Is religious and it is
entertaining. It opens with a description of a
number of interesting young women at col
lege together, and thence continues their his
tory out into society and through love, mar
riage and varied miseries, misuuderstaudings
and happinesses; weaving through it all
thoughts of God's watchful care over human
events, and showing the beauty of faith in the
women's characters. Part of the first chapter
is devoted to an account of the proceedings of
a prayer-meeting conducted by the young
ladies, which is quite a model for piety and
cleverness combined. In the portrayal of lhe
nature of Lucille Romayne there is displayed
the power of making life happy from sourc s
within the heart under both good and evil
happenings. In a conversation which Marguer
ite, who lias a practical turn, is carrying on
with her prospective sister-in-law, Claire, who
is that sort of a religious being Mrs. Humphry
Ward would call a mystic. Marguerite says:
"You are spiritual and I am human; you live
with Christ and I with his people, and may
not our united lives link them close to
gether?"
In a conversation between these two in their
college days Claire links playfulness with
piety in her explanation of the kindness of
Providence in sending her sorrow because of a
blunder in her lesson and its reprimand. She
said the teacher set her to write an essay on
melancholy, and it was found necessary to
bring about something to make her low
spirited in order that she might do justice to
her subject. The book is aided with numerous
quotations, culled with much taste, and is
very far from having the solemn dullness
usually expected in religious writings.
I RELIGIOUS.
THE RF.V. JOHN HENRY â By Percival Tt.
Benson. A. S. Barnes & Co., New York. For
sale by A. M. .rtooertson, Post street, CHy.
There is a great deal of religious discussion
in this little book, with the barest thread of a
story to fasten it together. The Rev. John
j Henry is brought up by his Puritan parents very
strictly In the orthodox faith, but after an ex
perience as a pastor of a wealthy congrega
tion in a large city his faith is shaken. He
explains to a friend what a void that lo=s has
made in his life. He says he has been forced
to confess that his faith is but a sham, a mass
of legends and fables "which profess to have
miraculous power to cleanse the heart and
thereby supply a mask for sin. He passes
tnrough his skeptic mood back to Christ
! aguin. He says: "The current of Jesus' life
i was altruisticin its nature, and itmust induce
in all lives near it currents of altruism, By
the intervention of faith lhe life of Jesus is
brought near to the life of him who believes.
| Faith is a creative power."

fine historical story of the boyhood of George
Washington, by MoJHe Elliot Seawell. There

MARRIED A LUKE.
THE AMERICiS DUCHESSâ By the Princess
de Bourg. New York: O. Vf, Dillingham Com
pany. For sale by the San Francisco .News Com
pany, Post street.
Fiction in this case differs from fact very
much in that the heroine of the story, Kitty
Fauntleroy, marries the English Dune irom a
sense of dutyâ she could not bear to break his
heart, and the Duke did not want her because
of her money, but was in love with her iv fine
romantic style. The novel is a very ordinary
one, but is to some extent redeemed by the
sweetness of Kitty's character. She is not in
love with the Duke and makes a very unhappy
bride, and her unhappiness is deeply shared
by a young American who is in love with her.
The story ends rather abruptly for those who
take any kindly interest in Kitty's life, for she
only gets to be a Duchess on the last page. A
note informs the reader that a sequel will
shortly be published under the title of "An
International Marriage."
CHARMS OF RURAL LIFE.
A BOOK OF COUNTRY CLOUDS AND BUN
SHINKâBy Clifton Johnson. Lee & Shepard,
Boston. Price *^ 50. Kor sale by the Whltaker
& Kay Company, Market street, City.
This book has many illustrations of scenes
photogruphed by the author in his travels
through New England. The clouds and sun
shine are tho?e of life rather than those of the
sky. The aim of the author lias been to tell of
farm and village life and character. He has
tried to make us understand what are the
charms of country life, and has drawn its
shadows without exaggeration. He .thinks
that a New England village, not too far re
moved from a railroad, is the pleasantest place
to live in the world. Bnt the finer pleasures
of rural living he explains cannot be had by
merely moving to the country. "You must
yourself be simple, must love a home of hum
ble comforts. Pride or style or artificiality
will never get at the heart of the life, and will
miss much ot the country sweetness."
FOR GOOD GUESSERS.
THE COLUMBIAN PKIZE CHARADESâ By
Herbert Inealls. Lee & .Shepard. publishers,
Boston. Price $1. For sale b/ the Whltaker <fc
Kay company, Market street, San Francisco.
A whole book full of charades for people to
sharpen their wits in efforts to gue?s is here
furnished on nice paper and in neat binding.
The best guesser by sending in the solutions
promptly to the publishers will win a prize of
$10. It is said that this is a sort of intel
lectual exercise of which Tennyson and Ma
caulay were fond, and that is certain evidence
that it is proper pastime for fine brains, and
probable evidence that it helps to brighten
brains. There is both entertainment and in
struction in the rhyme puzzles, and those
who try but fail to get the prize will probably
have succeeded in making their minds more
alert and ready to grasp some other of life's
chances.
DUDES AND CUPID.
HER MASH LETTER3-Publlshed by O. W.
Dillingham Company, New York. For sale by
the ban Francisco News Company, Post street
This purports to bo a collection of letters re
ceived by an actress from admirers of many
Kinds, but mostly fools. Each epistle is ac
companied by an illustration intended to
satirize the sender. One of those pictures an
actress in scant skirts standing before the
footlights with a toy man tied to a string,
which she holds in her hand aad pulls to
make the puppet dance to suit her. Distorted
cupids ore scattered profusely through the
pages, and these symbolize well the condition
of the minds and hearts of the silly senders of
the mash letters if we grant them genuine.
The book is dedicated "to a stagestruck girl."
A PRiZE STORY.
UNDER THREE FLAGSâ By B. L. Taylor and
A. T. Theits. Rand, McNally & Co., Chicago
and New York.
Stories of mystery seem to be now very much
in vogue, and among the prizes offered this
class usually has the biggest incentive held
out for their production. "Under Three
Flags" is tne winner of the third prize in the
Chicago Record's "$30,000 to Authors" com
petition. The desire to guess the solution of
the mystery Keeps the reader's attention alert
to every detail, and adds greatly to the interest.
No one in perusing this book should permit
a reckless curiosity to spoil the pleasure of
speculating ou how, and by whom, the crime
in it was perpetrated, with the reprehensible
act of turning prematurely to the lastchapters.
It would be very much the same thing as
eating green fruit from the great impatience
to let It ripen. For such reason it would not
be proper here to give any brief outline of the
story. To get the benefit of the mystery the
reader must pass slowly through his wonder
ment of how the puzzling affair can ever be
fully explained.
That the scene of the story is to a large ex
tent laid In Cuba will add to its attractiveness
at this particular time, when the Queen of the
Antilles is a place of so much interest.

NEW LITERARY PHENOMENON
/\rcKaic |*lar\r\erisn\s of the Old "Jatler" and
"Spectator" ReVWed in the West.
<JOUR<NJIL CELLED "PJIYLLIDJI OR TJIE JVUhKnMJIID "
California Is Determined to Further CorvVirxce the Eastern Cities of Its
/\rtistic and Literary Discrimination, and "Phvjllida" is
Intended to J-lelp the Qood Work
PHYLLIDA, OR THE MILKMAID, is the
novel title of the latest literary phenomenonâ
a small, four-page journal which in make-up
and typography defies the latter-day conven
tionalities. San Francisco is the home of this
"Bi-weekly Review, devoted to Literary Topicks
and Reflections on the Doings of the Town,"
and its purpose is to revive the short sub
jective essay and prove California's claims to
literary notice.
The typography of this newest venture into
journalism will effectually discount its inter
est to many readers who cannot read through
polumns of long "sb" without lisping or re
garding them as "f's" and the free use of
italics and small capitals will bewilder those
who are not versed in the vogue of the early
days of the eighteenth century.
Phyllida is a very accurate and consistent
revival of the archaic mannerisms of the old
Tatler, Spectator and Idler, and her spelling
would seem more familiar to Addison and
Steele than to present-day readers. Such
words as "shew," "preferr'd," "critick" and
"honour" appear frequently upon the pages
of the Milkmaid and. add to the quaint old
time aspect.
Phyllida is published and edited by Gelett
Burgess and Porter Garnett, both of the Lark,
and they have besides, as contributors to the
initial number, Bruce Porter, C. S. Aiken,
Mary Very and Geraldine Bonner. Several
other writers of local prominence are inter
ested in the venture, including members of
the faculties of both universities. If the en
terprise is not hurt at its inception by the
freakish aspect of its get-up there is no doubt
that it may do a good work Ln bringing to
gether California writers for the good of the
whole community, which has had such work
in convincing Eastern cities of its artistic and
literary discrimination.
DER LEHRER.
"Der Lebrer" is the title of a book pub
lished in German and intended for beginners
who desire to learn the languaee. It is con
versational, leading up from simple phrases
to those that will enable the student to un
derstand what is said and to be able to make
himself understood. The method is on the
principle of a mother teaching a child her
native tongue. [Published by G. A. Mosher,
Syracuse, N. Y. On sale by Professor \V. I.
Golby, Oakland, Cal.]
LITERARY NOTES.
The Macmillan Company announces the
forthcoming issue of "A First Bcok in Writing
English," which is worthy of special note. The
author, Edwin Herbert Lewis, Ph.D., is a
writer of experience, a teaiher on the iacuity
of the University of Chicago, and also in Lewis
Institute, a private secondary school. The
manual anticipates a demand which every far
seeing student of education knows that the
colleges must soon make for a much higher
degree of facility in the writing of good
English as a qualification for entrance.
"The National Movement in the Reign of
Henry 111, and its Culmination in the Barons'
War, 'Â» by Oliver 11. Richardson, professor of
history in Drury College, is the title of a book
to be issued by the Macmillan Company. Thii
brief history, based upon careful research, and
abounding in citations from original authori
ties, is designed for a student's book of refer
ence, but will interest the reading public, by
broad treatment and popular literary style.
Craik's English Prose, published by the Mac
millan Company, is completed with the issue
of volume V. The series now contains: Vol
ume I, The Fourteentu to the Sixteenth Cen
tury; volume 11, The Sixteenth Century to
the Restoration; volume 111, The Seventeenth
Century; volume IV, The Eighteenth Cen
tury; volume V, The Nineteenth Century.
Each volume contains selections from the
prose literature of the period named, with
critical introductions by various writers and
general introductions to each period.
The Macmillan Company of New York is
publishing a new edition of Thackeray's
works. The first volume that reaches our re
view desk is Henry Esmond. To this an intro
duction is contributed by Joseph Jacobs, who
has undertaken the work of editing the series.
The edition is a beautiful one, typographically
and pictorially, and serves to sustain the repu
tation of Messrs. Macmillan as publishers of
high-class literature, done up in the most at
tractive style. The price per volume is $2,
and the work as completed will be for sale by
William Doxey.
Scrlbner's for 1897 will be strong in Ameri
can enterprises. Both the serials are by Ameri
can writersâ Richard Harding Davis and W.
D. Howells. The series on "The Conduct of
Great Businesses" will describe American
achievements of the first importance. C. D.
Gibson, the artist whose reputation was mads
by his American girl in Lite, will adapt his
pen and pencil to a description of London.
Undergraduate life at American colleges will bo
described in another series and the conditions
and problems confronting American women
be discussed by Mrs. Helen Watterson Moody
under the title, "The Unquiet Sex."
Two historical novels, one relating to the
period of Cromwell, the other to the Arab
conquest of Egypt, are announced by Messrs.
Blaekwood. "Miriam Cromwell, Royalist,"
is the title of the fiist of these volumes, and
the writer is Miss DoraMcChesney. The other
one is called "Armenoso of Egypt," and the
author is Dean Butcher of Cairo. The dean ia
chaplain at Cairo ana is a popular figure with
English visitors who go there. He ia well
versed in Egyptology, ana now he makes one
of the most interesting threads of it the basis
of a romance.
The handsomely illustrated editions of De-
Amicis' "Holland" and "Spain," published by
Henry T. Coates & Co., Philadelphia, will this
year be followed Dy the same author's "Con
stantinople," in two small octavo volumes. In
this wc-tk De Amicis' wonderful descriptive
powers appear at their best. Its publication
is opportune, in view of the interest taken in
Turkish and Armenian affairs. The book con
tains aa excellent dee^ription of Constanti
nople and its famous localities, and gives one
a picture of the life ami types \o be seen there.
The volumes will be illustrated with fifty
photogravures reproduced from views taken
by a leading Turkish photographer.

Sifts fop Christmas.
"Munificence of giving may go hand in
hand with practical economy" writes one
authority, but at this season to be practi
cally economical is no easy matter, for as
even our most critical of foreign visitors
admit Californians are lavishly generous,
and of course at no season is this so notice
able as at the approach of Cflristmas, but
alas this year the hard times will prevent
many of us from sending the usual dainty
or helpful gift to much-loved friends;
however, Marcella has no intention of be
ing depressing, quite the contrary, she
wants to make a few suggestion- that may
prove useful to you all whether rich, poor
or just moderately well off. To begin
with remember that an appropriate eift,
one that shows forethought in its
selection, is far more prized than
one bought in a business-like way to
discharge some obligation. 1 was in
one of our leading ivearny-street stores
purchasing some chiffon not long ago
when my attention was attracted by one
of tlie most delightful grandfathers
( I am certain he was one). He was looking
at some rarely beautiful collars of duchesse
lnce. How carefully he adjusted his glasses
and tried to discover which was quite the
most exquisite of ali. He did not nave to
give a tiioueht to the pric,e, but how he
was trying to secure realiy the most lovely
to be found, probably intending to send it
in a Christmas- box for a bright-eyed
granddaughter, who will prize that bit of
lace long after the giver has passed
out of her life. I wonder it she
will ever know how carefully it was se
lected. You see the season is making me
sentimental, for. even if I do usually discuss
ruffles and frills, etc., most of the time I
am not so awfully matter of fact after all.
I left grandfather surrounded by the lace
collars, but before I leave this subject I
wish to suggest that lace will always be
found to be an acceptable gilt for women.
A yard or so will make a fascinating cap,
and a lace edge of mouchoir never comes
amiss. Even just a scrap will edge the
ends of a very tine bit of cambric, thus
completing one of tne pretty ties now
so fashionable. For voutnful relatives
not blessed with overmuch wealth are to
be seen the sheerest, most lace-like of
etitchings, on which you can spend as
much as you please, so varied are the
qualities to be had, and the dress patterns
now being ehown are to be had in almost
every conceivable fabric, sensible, ser
viceable woolen tweeds, the softest and
roost artistic of silks, etc. An acquaint
ance of mine, who has a small army of
nieces, has purchased several bolts of the
newest and loveliest of ribbons, and these
she intends to divide in suitable lengths
for the girlies. Who can doubt this aunt's
remembrances will be appreciated? Oh,
there are thousands of suggestions that
come crowding into my mind. However,
all my space must not be given to cloth
ing, for some people greatly object to re
ceiving anything of the sort, even when
their circumstances are far from flourish
ing, but just a word more on this topic.
Cast a glance at the lairy-like slippers that
were made for such just tootsies as M â 's,
and the warm, softly lined, fur-edged
sat'n ones that any invalid would be
pleased with; and oh, do not forget that
these days every one requires an umbrella.
Did you ever see such an assortment as
are on exhibition? And as for gloves, does
any one ever have a sufficient number of
pairs? You know how I love glass and
rhina, and indeed lives there a real,
flesh and blood woman who does not? So
when in doubt take my advice and, even
if the gift is a small one, reek a first-clitss
store, and tuere you will see standing, al
most side by side, the very exquisite little
pieces of cut glass, and the great bowis,
pitchers, plates and dishes that sparkle
and gleam like huge diamonds, offering
sore temptation to all who can understand
their fascinating beauty; but the small
olive dish, for not more than $3 or $4, is
just as perfect in its way as the more am
bitious ' articles. Numerous also are the
choice bits of china â for exam pie, a dear J it
tie cafe noir cup will cost no more than
some of the cards you sent a year or so ago,
and there are plaques and plates in be
wildering numbers, all worthy to bear our
greetings to even the most fastidious, but
when purchasing for those who
are commonly alluded to as hav
ing everything you want a real
novelty. One of the most beautiful
which has appeared for many years is the
Vollenden wear. Each piece bears the name
of some well-known artist, and whether it
is a gorgeous lamp, a superb vase, an in
cense-burner, or a wide-mouthed rose
bowl, each and every piece is a gem well
worthy a place In my lady's cabinet
among her most prized belonging? col
lected from foreign pans, for Jet it be
known far and wide that tbe Vollenden
wear is an American production. It will
never flood the country, so few are the
pieces of each kind that are ever made, so
in selecting such a present we can feel
certain of never seeing a duplicate; in
deed you will feel as though you wanted
every piece you see, so varied are the de
signs, so wonderful the coloring, so grace
ful the shapes. Also be sure to look at
the great collection of beer mugs; you can
purchase one very reasonably, or by a lit
tle heavier outlay, secure a very hand
some one, such a sensible trine for a
INydN^ &
bachelor, who would also find a corner in
his den for a royal Worcester tobacco jar
or a corpulent-looking whisky jug.
Jlbout Delft Wape.
You can find almost every conceivable
article in Delft this season, from a hair
brush with a Delft back to a branching
candelabrum. There are complete din
ner sets of it, vases, bowls, in truth every
thing you desire, including quaint
plaques, on which are depicted scenes of
New York taken 200 year? ago. Now, if
you can tear yourselves away from these
studies in blue and white give a glance at
tbe pretty work that comes straight from
"the land of the midnight sun" and you
are quite sure to invest.
Articles in silver were never *iore inter
esting. Even the inexpensive bits arc
rarely excelled in workmanship, and the
quaint Danish, German and old bits ol
English silver that reach us here arc
worth}' of the enthusiastic admiration of
the most critical. An ingenious contriv
ance that would be appreciated by many a
paterfamilias is a mutton- bone hoider,
which will prevent such a roast from
wickedly waltzing all over the dish. Al-o
there is the carnation cup. Buy one and
have the florist send it filled with say
carnations or great California violets am!
maidenhair ferns and the receiver will be
certainly please-.!.
I wish I could go on talking about the
varied and beautiful articles, but time
flies, and, children, I have not forgotten
you, bless your dear little hearts. Chri>t
mas belongs to you more than to any one
else, but you want such a lot of toys and
goodies that your mothers and aunties re
quire no suggestions of any sort from me.
You have told them exactly what you
want, and they are certain to be busily
employed purchasing everything, from a
monkey running up a string to an elab
orate dollhou-e, pair of ponies, etc. But
before I tell about the irocks and other va
rieties dear to the feminine world let me
wish you all a merry Christmas and a
happy New Year.
Wopn on tlie Stage.
Quite an event recently in Paiis was the
representation of "Don Juan" at the Op
era Comique, and very handsome were
some of the toilets. "The beautiful
mourning dress worn by Mile. Marcy in
the part ol Donna Anna merits descrip
tion. It was black velvet in tbe renais
sance style, with large pattern; the skirt
had a demi-train: at the sides puffs of
black satin held in with diamonds, in
front a black satin tablier covered with
jet and diamonds; the low bodice was
long waisted, and had a collar of white
guipure worked with jet; the black velvet
sleeves were slashed with satin, and the
slashes bordered with jet. She wore a
kind of Marie Stuart or renaissance head
dress of black velvet and jet. At the
cemetery scene a long black veil over this.
Mile. Delna, as Zerlina, had a pretty Span
ish peasant costume, a sky-blue short
skirt, with flounces of mousseiinede soie,
and as a bodice a charming little bolero or
jacket of violet velvet embroidered with
roses."
"The Haven of Content," at the Garrick
Theater, London, has been very popular,
and Miss Granville, as leading lady, has
taken much trouble to have her costumes
beautiful, artistic and appropriate. Suc
cess crowned her exertions, for the lead
ers of fanhion are all commenting most
favorably on her lovely toilets. One con
sists of a bodice of rich white guipure over
white satin; *be lovely crinkled sleeves
were of smoky gray crepe de chine. The
bodice of guipure was cut zouave fashion,
permitting a single fold of the white satin
to show above the soft gray belt. Round
the neckband was twisted a ribbon of a
pinkish mauvre color, and at the back of
the neck over it fell three little frills of
lace. Accompanying this creation was a
hat of gray felt, the brim being bound
with black velvet. The puffed crown was
of violet velvet, great clusters of Russian
violets nestled at one side and a smaller
bunch nestled under the brim so as to
rest becomingly in the hair. A London
correspondent gives such a good descrip
tion ot another. interesting frock that for
your benefit I quote:
"Quite of the style of to-morrow was a
gown of fine wool poplin in black. The
skirt was simple; it was the bodice that
calied for observation. The latter, de
vised upon horizontal lines, consisted, al
ternately, of rows of narrow pipings and
of black satin ribbon, which was attached
on the upper side only of the material.
The effect of thsse iines of ribbon falling
away from the figure was to give slender
ness to the waist, which a belt of black
satin, adjusted with sparkling buttons,
encircled. Four steel buttonn also ap
peared to fasten the bodice at one side,
and a double frill of black lace over white
maue a pretty trimming to the overlap
ping edge, as well as to the wristlets. The
sleeves were noteworthy for the new
means of giving width to the shoulders.
This result was attained by a serried row
oi tucks which turned upward and almost,
met at the points of a collar, composed of
cordings and black satin ribbon in the
same style as the rest of the bodice. A
black straw bat which > accompanied this
smart gown had a crown of black velvet,
and again the favorite trimming of vio
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
let. Miss Granville repeated the trans
verse style of trimming when she donned
a blouse of black tucked chiffon, which
she wore with a black skirt and a satin
belt buttoned with diamonds.
"We gained the assurance that in tbe
evening the arms may fitly be veiled
from a sight of the long, diaphanous
chiffon sleeves which Miss Granville wore
in combination with a low-necked black
satin gown. A hanging bertha of cut jet
formed the handsome trimming to this
dress; a diamond comb was introduced
above the hair-knot.
"Miss Haidee Wright, as a simple Eng
lish heroine, wore a most becoming even
ing gown of moonlight blue satin with a
bodice and full elbow sleeves of pleated
white silk gauze. A scarf of frilled white
chiffon accompanied this pretty costume
s an occasional shoulder-wrap."
Ideas Fpom Papis.
As I expected braiding of all kinds has
been so overdone that in Paris the
smartly dressed women have wisely re
turned to their far more becoming trim
mings cf velvet and fur, so again I say do
not tolerate machine braiding and avoid
braiding altogether if you would keep well
in advance of the fashion. However, we
should remember that braiding held its
own all last winter, so of course it could
not huve been expected to have been
stylish a second winter. That would have
sent Dame Fashion off into a tantrum.
Last week I saw a white-haired old lady
wearing the loveliest ruche of black chiffon,
which looked as though quail feathers had
oeen used to edge it. How I wonder
where it came from. 1 have not seen
-uch another anywhere. But you want
news about some beautiful blouses.
Across the pond corduroy velveteen is en
joying a considerable popularity, and very i
effective wjre two blouses sent out by a
good bouse very recently. One was of a
tomato red and the other of a gorgeous
green; both of these were worn with turn
down collars and cuffs. A green plaid
glace waist and one of geranium-colored
bengaline were both cut like shirt, waists.
From the same source, much admired,
was a black grenadine with a chine flower
upon it. Bands of green miroir velvet
extend from the shoulder to below the
waist, turn way back with jewel em
embroidered revers; small frills of black
chiffon outline the decolletage.
An evening blouse I like is composed of
alternate frills of chiffon and fine-pointed
embroidery. Round the armholes is a
double bow of apricot watered ribbon,
and the ruched sleeves of chiffon reach
the elbows. Equally attractive is one of
an infinitesimaily striped green and black
velvet. This is cut in loose bolero form,
edged with mink, and shows an nnder
bodice of a lighter grpen chine silk, with
a draped band of the velvet around the
waist. A fichu edged with ruffles bordered
with very narrow black velvet assists ir.
adorning. Yet another, which has an
under bodice and sleeves formed of bouil
lonnes of white striped with black velvet
ribbons; pale mauvre glace forms the
epaulettes and fichu. Quite lovely is a
bodice of ivory tinted Irish lace mounted
on chiffon, belted and buttoned with tur
quoises. Marcella.
Fashions fop Men.
When the Prince of Wales appeared in
a double-breasted blue reefer (or three
seamer) recently at an afternoon function
the tailors were filled with consternation,
for it is "a compromise between the frock
and the lounge. Home declare that ere
long this garment will be worn with a top
hat, as it has a more dressy effect than
the regulation aack coat." In New York
some of the best tailors are making
square -cornered, double-breasted "jack
ets" of either a black or bine cheviot, or
an unfinished worsted. There are two
pockets, and the jacket fits loosely and
extends over the hips. It is worn but
toned.
Broadcloth and vacuna are entirely out
of date for evening dress suits, as is also a
species of diagonal much used some three
years ago. The cloth now employed is
known as dresscloth, or a diagonal neither
too fine nor too coarse. When a cloth waist
coat is worn it is single - breasted, with
three buttons; if it has a U-snaped collar
it must be of the same fabric as the rest of
the suit; however, the most fashionable
waistcoat is of white duck or linen, is
double-breasted, has three buttons and a
narrow collar. A Tuxedo is never worn
with a white waistcoat, neither is a white
lawn tie. A black satin tie is correct if
not in mourning, but nnder such circum
stances black corded silk is substituted.
A reader asks a 'New York authority
whether it would be correct for nim to
wear either an opera or silk hat with a
dinner coat.
He is correctly informed that "the
dinner coat is semi-formal evening dress
and as such requires the headgear used on
ordinary .or semi-formal occasions. A
short coat and a tall hat are elements
which do not agree. The gist of these
remarks is that neither a tall nor an opera
hat should be worn with dinner coat The
proper hat is a derby or a Homburg; black
for winter and a straw in summer."
A youth of 18 may wear an evening coat
or a Tuxedo, provided he observes strictly
as to the waistcoats and ties provided for
each garment
The round-shaped buttoned patent
ieather boot is stylish for walking; with
lounge suits are worn round-toed black
leather boots.
Low quarters or patent leather pumps,
are worn with evening dress. Buttons
are very popular at present. Russet boots
are now only worn on rainy days for golf
ing or tramping around the country.
Spats are never worn with russet boots.
The Gost of a Duke.
Fifteen millions is tbe price of a real
first-class Duke. At least, that is what tbe
New York World says W. K. Vanderbilt
paiu for the honor of allying iiis family
name with that of the ancient house of
Marlborough. This statement, says the
World, is made on the unquestionable au
thority of an English gentleman visiting
in Washington, who has been in a posi
tion to know all the facts. His account is
circumstantial and undoubtedly correct.
The terms of the settlement were $10,
000,000 â or, to speak with absolute accu
racy, the income of $10,000,000â 0n Mr.
Vanderbilt's daughter during her lifetime,
and $5,000,000 on the Duke. If children
are born they will inherit the mother's
portion at her death. If the marriage
shall be without issue this $10,000,000 will
revert on the death of the Duchess. But
the Duke's $5,000,000 is to be bis in any
event. The settlement was not made in
cash but in investments for the benefit of
the Duke and Duchess. These invest
ments are principally in the stocks and
bonds of the Lake Shore and other Van
derbilt railroads.
The Empress of Japan and her ladies
have taken to the bicycle and use a maze
of walks made on purpose for them in the
Bacluded part of the imperial gardens.

NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 14.â Tbe people
need a rest!
A rest from the hustle and bustle and
worry of these modern days. A rest from
dissembling, a rest from sensationalism.
Our true expression is being forever lost
under the grinding mask we feel com
pelled to constantly wear. We have be
come so artificial ourselves that we look
on everything, everybody, and even life
itself, with eyes of distrust, with hearts
steeled against the outward showing, be
it grief or joy, misery or prosperity.
We live on artificial foods, artificial heat,
artificial air. Oar mode of dressing, wear
ing jewelry, greeting strangers and gov
erning our children is becoming more
artificial with each succeeding generation.
So it is, so it will be until matter? reach
such an extreme that the limp and emaci
ated public will cry a halt, and then the
great rest cure will begin.
Santa Claus is almost at our gates. Dear
old rosy-cheeked, jolly-eyed, frosty-haired
Santa Claus! He can only hoodwink
youngsters under six years of age these
days.
The other afternoon a pretty, dark
haired young kit of only six autumns,
said in a very earnest little way, and a
hint of disappointment in her Â»oice, "You
see, I know there is no Aal Santa Claus.
I wish there was one, 'cause it 's such good
fun to be 'sprlsed on Christmas morning."
Then with a confidential whisper, "I'm
not going to tell EJdie or Alfred 'bout it,
'cause they think Santa Claus comes down
the chimney; they're younger 'an me.
and don't know that he doesn't." Poor
iittle tot, already she has learned the first
lesson in deception.
Where are the Californians? The last
week has been unusually dull in tbe Cali
fornia colony. There have been few ar
rivals, and those who have been in the
city for weeks are busy shopping for the
holidays or attending to business matters
of importance. â¢
Among the early arrivals of the week
were Mrs. Cameron C. Thorne and Miss
Thorne of Los Angeles. They engaged
rooms at the Holland, and will hear the
Christmas chimes in New York.
A. tfowden of San Francisco arrived
from a trip abroad last Sunday. He anti
cipates being at home for the holidays.
J. W. Brozel!, formerly of the San
Francisco Stock Exchange, has been a
guest at the Metropolitan during the past
week. He will start homeward on Tues
day. Mr. Brozeil is enthusiastic over the
future of the new mining fields in South
ern California and he has interested a
number of Eastern magnates in a bg
minine scheme which wili be heard of ere
long. California is returning to the good
old boom days, evidently, for surely there
are many great things being predicted
and scores of Easterners with money are
planning Western trips and Western in
vestments.
Mingling with the crowd at the Profes
sional Woman's League Bazaar last even
ing, I met John T. Malone, the lawyer
actor and writer of San Jose. Mr. Malone
has grown quite gray daring the past few
years, but it is becoming to his strong,
handsome face. He is really a thorough
New Yorker now, though he speaks with
the same clannish spirit of every true Cali
fornian. M.\ Malonn has virtually left the
stage and has returned to the old love of
his youth, the practice of the law. He
was admitted to the New York bar last
Jane. In connection with bis practice he
nas been busily encaged in writing and
preparing matter for Charles Dudley War
ner's new books, "The World's Best Lit
erature." Misa Geraldine Malone, his
lovely young daughter, is here with him.
R. P. Carter of Santa Monica has re
turnea from a long and delightful visit
with relatives in England.
Charles F. and Ross B. Hoffmann are
guests at the Holland.
There is a heap of injustice and miser
able rubbish in some people's lives, and it
keeps them and their few friends squaring
accounts and clearing away the debris of
misfortune which always threatens to
crush out their existence.
Poor little Lee Bascom has had a
thorny little path to follow, and though
she has stanch friends to encourage her at
times, her gifted soul suffers untold agony
through the injustice and ignorance with
which she is fated to come into contact
After writing a number of very worthy
little volumes and having had her play,
"The Bowery Girl," accepted and pro
duced, she finds that, in the very flush of
success, her contract with the mana?ers
who have just put her play on is so flimsy
and unstable that her income from it is
virtually cut off and reduced to nothing
ness. Miss Bascom is in very ill health,
and this new blow to her ambitions has
well nigh prostrated her. She could re
sort to the courts, but, like all talented
ones, she shrinks from the unsavory pub
licity of such a move. Her friends in the
West will watch with intense interest the
outcome of it all.
W. C. Hunter has just returned from
Spain and foreign lands in excellent
health and spirit He will not remain
long in Gotham, but will hasten down to
the Argentine Republic, where he will
make a thorough investigation of mining
properties there. He expects to be in Cal
ifornia before many months.
The news of the sad and tragic death of
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and her demented
daughter was a great shock to the colony
here. Expressions of grief and sincere
regret have been many.
J. C. Ainsley of San Jose is at the Broad
way Central for a few days.
Mile. Yvette Guilbert sailed into town
this weeK with a half-dozen trunks filled
with decollete gowns, long ploves and
other pretty things. Besides Yvette has
a lot of naughty, naughty, naughty carol-,
which she will shrilly pour into our listen
ing ears. Yvette will not take us in, as
she did last year; we know a thing or
three now, andâ well, Yvette can't teaci
us French this time, we have heard a few
others since her last warblings here.
"Inspiration depend? on atmosphere,
nothins more," said John P.iilip Sousa
the other evenine when speaking of his
compositions." He declares that inspira
tion cannot always be born with tbe
thought, especially when composing
music. The click of a telegraph-machine
will perhaps introduce a melody into the
brain which can be at once transmitted
to paper. The idea is new in many re

a FeW Suggestions for the Benefit of "Willie day
Wurst" of the NeW York Charnal.
Une week ago the Examiner, like Silas
Wegg, "dropped into poetry." One of its
bright young men was instructed to
"make a page of it," and as he was paid
space rates, he readily complied. The
work was easier, because the Southern
Pacific Company's "thirty thousand dol
lar beauty" was merely revamping an idea
which was not new, and because, in its de
sire to divert attention from its "Long
Green," anythine would go.
Therefore the young man who "had the
poet detail" waded boldly in, equipped
with a copy of the New York Press of
Sunday morning, October 18, 1896, as a
mentor and adopting a gas-meter for his
versification. As he toiled ho gleefully
thought of the "soft snap" he had struck
as a poet for a "day detail." Infinitely
easier than writing up bogus "statements"
by Wyatt Earp, as some of the members
of the staff had been compelled to do, the

Examiner has justly won as "the $30, 000

aHow a Light-K,eepep Rowed Though Jl\r.
San Pedro Man Who Participated in a Famous /\ttempt to Gross
the /Ulantic in a Balloon With a ]pair of Oars.
A San Jose man's recent story about
going to Honolulu on a flying-machine
has been much derided, yet thirty years
ago an aerial trip from New York to Eu
rope was regarded by eminent scientists aa
practicable. Such an attempt, which was
probably the most brilliant of its kind
ever made, was participated in by George
V, Shaw, now lightkeeper at Point Firmin
lighthouse, near San Pedro.
The trip was planned as an experiment
to verify the theory of Professor Wise, who
held that there were continuous air cur
rents over tbe Atlantic between the United
States and Europe. He maintained that
at a certain height the current moved in
one direction, and at a different elevation
the air was blown the other way. Accord
ing to this theory a balloon could be
made to move either way across the At
lantic by simply keeping it at the right
level.
It was planned to have a big balloon
and to that end Professor Wis* contracted
with Goodsell Bros, of New York- to
supply one of twilled silk with a capacity
of 600,000 cnbic feet of gas. The balloon
was made of material similar to cotton
muslin instead of silk, ana when the
makers brought it â to Prospect Park,
Brooklyn, for Professor Wise's inspection
i he complained of the material but agreed
to accept it if it would stand inflation.
Accordingly great preparations wÂ«Â»re
made for the etarting of the voyage. The
balloon was to carry directly beneath it a
circular canvas bouse 12 feet in diameter
and 7 feet high for use in scientific ob
servations. Suspended next beneath was
a wicker basket for the passengers and
next under it was a complete lifeboat
fitted for navigation anywhere at sea.
Shortly before the day for starting in
quiry was made for a man who would go
with the party and act as navigator should
the strange craft sink to the ocean. In
tLis way bbaw came to be chosen.
"There were five of us who were to co
on the air passage," said Mr. Shaw to the
writer. "The party comprised Professor
Wise, Professor Donaldson, anothei well
known aeronaut, Â» scientist from Wash
ington and a reporter for the Daily
Graphic. Many newspaper accounts of the
expected voyaee were printed, hut at my
urgent request my name was omitted
from them.
"On ihe day we were to start there were
probably 20,000 people grouped about the
queer craft, notwithstanding a lliph ad
mission fee, and thousands more looked
on from trees and housetops.
"Tbe inflation of tbe huge sack was
begun, common illuminating gas being
used. Tons of canned goods more than
we cotfld carry had been contributed. The
outfit includfd a ca#e of carrier pigeons,
Cmong which was the then celebrated
Mrecord-breaking bird 'Ariel.' There was a
Supply of rubber floats to be dropped into
ti,e sea where they might be picked up by
passing ships.
"As the inflation progressed 200 men,
aided by lines' attached to forty tons of
Handbags, held the captive balloon, but
when it was only three-fourths filled there

In some unaccountable way the able
poet who was engaged to write up the
airship for the Examiner, while ha was
dreaming of his expected "castles in
Spain," forgot to put into print for the
benefit of the readers of the "Monarch,"
some of the meters which he found in the
New Yors Press, which served as a
model.
Now, the New York poet was away up in
his business in some respects. His use of
meter can perhaps be as well illustrated
by a gem wnich, in his farce-comedy, is
supposed to be sung by Boul-Yon, a capi
talist, a disguise adopted by Willie Jay
Wurst, a youthful prodigy, owner of* the
New York Charnal and speculator in cock
roach farming. This little gem is given
to show that the Examiner poet held back
something of the original, which the read
ers of that paper, more than any one elsti,
would thoroughly enjoy. Here it is :
SONG
I am tbe owner of tbe New York Charna!â
Droolâ droolâ drool, I drool!
Sponsor for all unclean and carnalâ
lllsb-cum-bubl'le and a bul alow reel!
I've got the rocks to keep well oiled.
And to knock the wool off the Thieving \V oiled!
I'm a-hustling around in a bellowing sweat,
And I'll get in the cockroach jet, you bet !
I've forty-eight freaks on every page-
Droolâ droolâ drool. I drool !
You'd scarce expect it of one my ageâ
Bish-cum-bubble and a bull slow reel!
I wallow all around in print each day,
I've got a circulation tbat's a pure give-away!

(He falls in a trance, but manages to secure his
false beard and crawl to one side, where he lets
loose a carner-plgeon for the Charnal office with a
slxty-eigbt-column story of a liverless camel that
whistles, "Come, Biay With Me!" through us
ears.)
Of course, the poet, in view of the "sack"
the great bag to collapse. This at once
ended the undertaking, and the would-be
passengers stood there in the midst of
that crowd looking about as sheepish as
men well could under such circum
stances."
But this failure stimulated Shaw in a
fancy that an airship could be made

practical if only the balloon principle were
combined with that of a motor.
"Experimenting along this line," said
he, "I constructed a working model about
thirty feet in length. There was enough
balloon about it to make it float, or nearly
so. It was cigar-shaped, with a lifeboat
underneath. Extending up from the
center was a shaft on which wa^ a screw

which he expected to drawdown as pay
for his useful space story, could hardly be
expected to represent tbe thinly disguised
proprietor of poets as openly confessing,
in the language of the refrain:
Droolâ droolâ drool, I drool,
Nor to cause him to say "I wallow all
around in print each day" for fear there
would be "more truth than poetry" in
sight; but, really, the public are entitled
to this metrical exhibition, and so The
Call cheerfully supplies the omission.
There were other gems in the New York
Press drama which will be appreciated
here. One speech, by "Boul-Yon," other
wise "Willie Jay Wur'st," is characteristic.
An extract from the drama, which really
contains "more truth than poetry," is re
produced from the New York Press, as
follows:
Boul-Yonâ Ahem! My dear sirs, I trust you
will remember thnt I am actuated by no de
sire for personal gatn. My sole ambition is
the good of tbe Naiion. All I wish is to assure
myself of your hearty co-operation in my
efforts for the amelioration of the poor labor
ing man.
Allâ Sure !
Boul-Yonâ That is to say, what I want is
noise! The laboring man needs to be im
pressed with his wrongs. He must get rousea
and excited about something or other. Now,
suppose we touch him up on the currency
question. He thinks he understands that,
you know. I'll furnish a talker, and you
swear by everything he says. Make 'eni listen.
Cram what he says down everybody's throat !
Choke the ones who won't pay attention! I'll
fix it with you. Beet
Allâ You bet!
Bwill-Manâ When'i the hollow to begin?
Boul-Yonâ On, that's all fixed.
AnothÂ°r hiatus on the part of the Ex
aminer's day detail poet is also painful.
The following, also from the New York
motion, was obtained by a screw propeller
attached to a shaft extending to the rear.
This shaft could be readily bent horizon
tally so as to give steerage. For a motor
I operated the model with a powerful
spring, wound like o'ie in a clock.
"I tried the model in a large building.
When wound it would run for fifteen
minutes, bumping against the walls and
roof in. an animated style. I found it
would cost me $30,000 to build an airship
for practical use on this plan. I presented
the case to General George B. McClellan,
who gave me a hearing, but was so busy
with his New York dock contracts he
could not give it further attention. Peter
Cooper, founder of t lie famous institute
that bears his name, displayed evident in
terest iv it and declared lie would like to
Press, could have been worked in to ad
vantage, to the delight and edification of
all California, where there is a cultivated
fondness for excellent portrait work:

Watch me chaw up the whole blame town!

There are so many episodes in which
the proprietor of the New York Charnal
and- tbe San Francisco Examiner has
figured that the muse, even a "day
detail" muse, need not have been at loss
for themes.
Appended are a few suggestions fur
nished by a contributor who courts the
muse at a distance:

Danger irv Luxury.
The installation of electric illumination
in old English mansions and castles built
after the fashion of ages ago is apt to be
attended with disaster. It is impossible
to foresee all the dangers that may lurk
in well-seasoned timber, for have not we
been warned about putting new wine in
old bottlesj And the utmost care must
be taken by skilled electricians even
where ail is plain sailing.
Blenheim Palace is the latest sufferer
from this infusion of too much blood into
ancient veins. Not many weeks ago one
of the rare old Elizabethan mansions be
longing to a great English family was ut-
terJy destroyed from this same desire to
i be up to date en the part of its owner.

take hold of the matter, but was too old.
I finally had to give it up, but I have in
sisted to this day that my plan was a prac
ticable one.
"Did I ever try any other scheme for
air navigation? No, not on a large scale.
But I did make an aerial velocipeae which
operated surprisingly well. It consisted
iof two cartridge - shaped balloons of
oiled silk, kept in position by ash frames
and properly inflated. The ouoyant
power was barely sufficient to lift the ap
paratus and one's weight. The conical
ends pointed in opposite directions, and
the two balloons were kept a few feet
apart by strong connecting pieces of asn.
Between the ash pi ece s was arranged a
seat and footrest. This apparatus would
support one in the air and only the
means of locomotion were lacking. This
lack I supplied with oars, which prac
tically made the craft an aerial row
boat. In order to get the desired re
sistance on the oar?, 1 made them like
huge fans, consisting of a strong light
framework, covered with silk. I fast
ened the oars in the rowlocks
so that I would not los 9 them.
My scheme was to propel the craft in a
forward direction, which would make it
necessary to push on the oars instead of pull
ing on them. It would also be requisite to
'feather' them carefully so that after one
push I could without much resistance re
cover them in position for the next push.
To get an upward or downward motion I
would only need to turn t c oars at a
sh^ntly different angle when pushing
them. By worlcing unequally on the two
oars I could turn to the right or left as I
degired. These were the movements by
which I believed I would be able to navi
gate the craft. The test verified my
tneories.
"One bright afternoon when there was
no breeze to interfere with operations I
took the velocipede to Central Park for a
trial. Hundreds of people watched opera
tions. When everything was in readiness^
even to a small locker of provisions which
I carried, I took my position in the seat,
grasped the oars and prepared to leave
terra lirma. I thought to myself the re
sistance of the big fan-like oars against
the air would be slight, and accordingly I
gave them a very strong push. The result
was gratifying, yet startling.
"The idea of rowing through the air
worked so well that lat once determined
to begin manufacturing the new craft.
I planned that wifliin a month I should
have the air velocipedes on the market
and be able to sell them lor $300 or less
apiece.
"One day, soon after the successful trial
of the machine, I met Professor Wise and
told him of my proposed manufacturing
scheme.
" 'Don't do it,' said he.
"'Don't do it? Why nolT said I in
amazement.
" 'If you manufacture snch a craft,' he
explained, 'ail the young scions of the no
bility and other sons of wealthy parents
will buy them. The ease with which the
maohines may be propelled will tempt the
boys to racing and all other kinds of fast
flying. The first you know some of the
reckless ones will have a midair collision,
their machines will break, there will be a
great fall and somebody will be responsi
ble for one or more lads' deaths. Do you
want to assume such a responsibility?'

impressed me so strongly that I made up
my mind 1 didn't. W. R. Greenwood.

Eventful Career of a StalWart Pioneer of Our Territory in the
Land of the Midnight Sun.
Joseph Juneau, the founder of Juneau,
Alaska, and" who has had one of the
strangest and most romantic careers of
any man perhaps on the Pacific Coast, is
in the City. Mr. Juneau comes of a race
of town-builders and trail-breakers. His
uncle, Solomon Juneau. founded Mil
waukee, and other relatives have been
conspicuous in opening the country for a
distance of 4000 miles.
Mr. Juneau is of French-Canadian stock.
He was born at Montreal and has been on
this coast forty-five years. Some of his
people before him were famous hunters
and trappers, belonging to the Hudson
Bay Company and the American Fur
Company.
Yesterday this strange pioneer, who,
oddly enough, yet speaks a language
strongly indicative of his French blood,
talked of himself and the gold mines with
which he had "bean connected.
"When I was 20 years old," he said, "I
left Montreal and came direct to Califor
nia. This was in ISSI, at a time when
there was a great rush to the gold fields.
The first mining I did was at Downieville.
I remained there well on to two years and
made considerable money. Then I came
down to San Francisco and went across
tbe bay to where Oakland is now and
bought a farm of 220 acres. It was be
tween San Leandro and a place then
called San Antonio. Most of it is now
covered over with big buildings. I stayed
there and farmed nine years, raising grain
principally.
â¢ "After that I put in in all nine years in
Montana and made about $20,000.
"Then, in 187-4, I concluded I would
have to strike out to a new country, and I
went up to Alaska. That was very early,
and the country had not been prospected
even along the coast. I set to work and I
found gold. It was tbe first gold that had
ever been struck in the Territory. I found
it at a place called Shuck, eighty miles
from Fort Wrangel, en the river of that
name and near the bay which bears that
name. It was at a point about half way
between Juneau and Fort Wrangel. Bat
I only made three or four dollars a day
mining there, and I wasn't satisfied with
it; so, the boom in Cassiar coming on, I
went there. I stayed there five years;
but I wasn't lucky. I didn't do much. I
made enough to live on and get around on
but no stake.
"In 1880 I went back to Alaska, this
I time going to Juneau, and there I found
! the rich placer and quartz mines which
j have made the country so celebrated over
I the globe. They were the mines of the
Sliver Bow basin, a few miles from
| Juneau. I started to work oa these
| mines and founded a town.
"I was fairly fortunate at Juneau, for I
I made about $40 OOQ there. Of course, I
| didn't k-ep it all, for it's hard to live in a
| country like that and not let your money
j go. Living is high and everything you do
| takes cash.
"When I sold out .in the Silver Bow
Basin I went away up the Yukon River.
This was two years ago. I went to Circle
City, the far northern camp, which lies
inside the Arctic circle, and where you
can see the sun all the time in summer.
This, though a new camp, is a great one.
There is a wonderful amount of gold there.

Photographing Through a Beetle's Eye.
Wonderful Effects Produced by Its Use as a Lensâ A NeW Field
for Scientific Exploration.
The marvelous feat of taking a photo
graph through a lens composed of a
beetle's eye is the achievement of which
Dr. G. F. Allen of Aurora, 111., can boast.
The result which is pictured in the ac
companying illustration is that a separate
outline of the image at which the camera
is directed is seen on every one of the
hundreds of facets which are part and
parcel of the eye of the insect so familiar
to us all.
This is the first instance where anything
of the sort has been accomplished. Here
tofore there has been any quantity of
theory but a great lack of practice. Now
we have tbe practice in the most convinc
ing of forms â a photograph. It all came
about through a curious statement made
at a meeting of the British Scientific Asso-
BEETLE'S EYE â A MAN'S SILHOUETTE IN EVERY FACET.
ciation, at which W. M. Stine of the
Armour Institute of Chicago called atten
tion to a very curious and interesting
lantern-slide in his possession. During a
discussion of the properties of the .Roent
gen rays, a leading scientist suggested that
ascertain insects had eyes seemingly un
adapted to see by ordinary sunli ht, they
might visualize by means of the X rays.
Now ii v/aa held by a number of the
savants in attendance at the association
that the X ray could hardly be termed an
incentive to visualization. So warm did
the discussion become that it was finally
decided to make a genuine test with the
eye of a chosen insect, and it is the result
of this decision that proves one of the
most interesting feats ever accomplished
by means of that great aid to science, the j
camera.
Dr. Allen of Aurora, 111., is one of the]
cold. If we had a climate like California
it would be a good deal richer country
than this. But even in summer time there,
if you dig down a foot underground, you
will come to ie. Somehow it may be
pretty hot, but the ice never melts. You've
got it there always. For this reason it is
hard work comparatively to mine.
"But I made $3QOO in cash up there, and
besides that I own four good claims. Two
of the claims are in Dead wood Gulch ana
the two others are on Holliday Creek. 1
consider them very valuable property. I
am going Dack there in the spring. There
few men of scientific mind who has taken
a special interest in the wonders that the
art of photography can be made to reveal.
So he chose the eye of a beetle to demon
strate to the satisfaction of every one that
tbe X ray was no aid to visualization
whatever. The result of his experiment
proves conclusively that he was right and
that the eminent gentlemen who favored
the X-ray theory were as far from the
truth as was preacher Jasper when he in
sisted that "the sun do move."
It is a cuiious study that this photo
graph lays open to the laymen of science.
We all know that the beetle has the curi
ous projecting eye, very similar to the sort
one sometimes sees in man himself. The
eye is large" and round, or alraosj so. It
can hardly be called a perfect sphere, for
it is slisrhtly convex in shape. The ac
companying picture shows really one-naif
of the eye of the beetle. Such insects
have eyes called compound, formed not of
one lens but of several hundred, set side
by side like cells in a honeycomb. How
does the world appear through such eyes
is a query of unusual interest.
Writing of this photograph \V. M.
Stine, previously referred to, says of Dr.
Allen'* picture of the insect's sight world,
here shown :

took the cornea of the. eye oi a beetle

the light coming through the beetle's eye
from the silhouette and developed in the
usual manner.
'As can be seen the resulting multi
graph was circular, and contained several
hundred images of the profile, one, indeed,
for each facet of the eye. The oamera
used for taking a large number of simulta
neous photographs and objects is the
physical analogue of such an eye. The
relation of the eyes of such insects to
those of mammals with the single adjust
able lens is that of a single focus or snap
shot camera to the ordinary form in which
the focus is adjustable.
"It seems reasonably clear that insects
form their judgments of distance from
multiple images, depending upon the
power of each facet to reflect light rays.
The nearer the object the greater would
be the area covered by the images of the
retina. It is scarcely conceivable that
rays not capable of refraction or of being
focused, which is the cass with the X
rays, can by simple shadow effects enable
a judgment to be formed on the distance
of an object. W. M. Stine."
It is impossible to conceive from the
picture that is printed in a newspaper aa
absolutely correct idea of the wonderful
clearness with which the different facets
of the beetle's eye cause to be placed upon
the plate the image which they reflect.
Although the image is shown a hundred
or more times, in every instance it is
clear and perfect. Very fine and delicate
are the lines to be sure, and the features
are only distinguishable clearly by the
aid of a microscope; but nothing is
omitted, and the wonderful handiwork of
nature has never been more clearly shown
than when this eye with artificial stimulus
cariies out the pait for which it was cre
ated.
It so happens that in this instance, as
stated, a silhouette was used instead of
the ordinary photograph. It will be ob
served that this is exactly -what the ac
companying illustration hhows. Other
and similar experiments, however, have
demonstrated the truth of the statement
as to the accurate reproduction of every
lineament of the human face. To gain
an adequate *idea of exactly what a photo
graph through the multiple facets of a
beetle's eye accomplishes, look carefully
into the eye of some person who is close
to and looking steadfastly at you. You
will see reflected in the eye of tlie other
your own lace, clear and distinct, with
not a vestige of a line missing. Now this
is just what happens when the beetle
ldoks at you, only your eyes are reflected
several hundred times.
This is what the photograph taken by
Dr. Allen shows. It is one of the most
remarkable combinations of different
branches of science that the world has yet
seen.

All very true, my dears, but don't you

were a little of "giving up" concerned?
A little self-denial.

Mamma says if I'm good
And mind her every day,
And if I bring her in her wood
And don't go out to playâ
She'll write to you a letter
And tell you what to bring,
But I thought that I had better
Do just that very thing.
I'd like a hobby-horse,
A whistle and a dram;
Nuts and candy, too, of course,
And also bring some gum.
I'd like to have a train of cars
That really run by steam,
For they, I think by far,
'jJove others are supreme.
Don't forget a wagon.
And say, I'd like a wheel,
When all but that are gone,
To you I'll grateful feel.

Oh, you're the dearest thing!
I hope you won't forget a

JUMBO
By Chables E. Anderson.
Once upon a time in a far country there
lived a King, who was very rich as well as
great and powerful, butala*! his temper
was as great as his riches and finally
proved greater -than even his mighty
power.
This King had many followers and ser
vants, among the latter being his clown
or funny man, whose name was Jnmbo.
The King delighted in Jumbo, for he was
very witty, and no matter how dull his
Majesty might feel Jumbo could always
bring a smile to the royai face.
Now, Jumbo owed all his success to his
fairy friend and adviser "Rosebud."
Every morning at sunrise he would seek
Her bower, and kneeling at her feet would
take counsel from her dewy lips as to how
he might amu-e the King during the long
hours of the day and ni;:hU
One morning ere the sun had risen
Rosebud received a message from the
queen oi the fairies <o appear before her
at once. She was filled with alarm and
hastened to obey, all thoughts of Jumbo
fleeing from her mind.
Poor fellow ! when at the usual hour he
Eought the sweet-scented bower there was
no fairy kiss awaiting him, no fairy lips to
SDeak words of wisdom. He turned sadly
away, and when summoned before the
King his step was slow and his bead hung
low.
Beside the King was seated another
monarch, who had come from a great dis
tance, ana Jumbo's lord had been brag
ging about the great wit of his clown.
"Come, my good fellow, and teli us the
news! How goes it w.th you? We're
ready for a laugh! Come, be quick!"
Poor Jumbo was at a loss ! Not a word
could he speak, but stood as if dumb!
The King grew angry, waved his scepter
and then raged and stormed with all the
fury of a wild beast, but of no avail-
Jumbo was speechless.
"I'll settle you, then," cried the King.
"Away with him, guards! Confine in the
dungeon! Behead him at the hoar of
midnight!"
So poor Jumbo, decked in his gay
clown's dress with its many little tinkling
bells, was marched from the King's
presence nvdÂ«t the clashing and clanking
of the swords of the stern guards.
When the great clock commenced to
strike the hour of midnight, the doors of
his cell were opened and he was taken out
in to the courtyard. As he stood surrounded
by the King's soldiers, he heard the soft
wbir of dainty wings, and a gentle voice
whispered in his ear, "I have a coat, I'll
drop it at your feet. When the soldiers
turn their beads, pick ii up and put it on
as quickly as yon can.''
Jumbo obeyed the voice, and imme
diately became invisible.
Ah! His dear little Rosebud had come
Oh, the JVlerry
Merry Mor\tÃs!
Twelve twirling tops
As light as air;
Two children gay
With streaming hair.
So many times
The tops they've spun
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1896.
fbITED DV-
in time to save his life, and together they
hurried beyond the castle grounds.
As soon as they were at a safe distance
Rosebud told him to take off the coat and
return it to her, which he did. "Now,
Jumbo, you must fly for your life. The
officers are searching for you. high and
low, and if you are captured they will tor
ture you terribly."
''Ob, sweet Rosebud, first tell me, I
pray ttiee, how 1 may have revenue on the
wicked King. Thou knowest it was my
sadness and need of thee that excited his
anger."
"Oh, foolish youth, "she answered.
"But if you travel 1000 miles directly south
you will come to a desert, in the center of
which stand two larse date trees. From
these trees you must pluck twenty dates â
ten from each tree. One bears very small
fruit, while the other beaTS a large va
riety. After doing this return, and send the
ten small dates as a giftto the King."
"But I can't see how that will revenge
me," cried Jumbo.
"Wait! These dates possess a strange
power. The small ones cause the nose to
grow to be of an enormous length, while
the large ones restore it to its natural
size!"
"Oh ! " said Jumbo.
"Now," continued the fairy, "when
your gift is received the King and his Queen
and the young Princes will eat of it, and
I immediately their noses will become a
j yard long and they will be in great
I trouble. The King will send messengers
here and there for learned doctors and
magicians, but you alone bold the secret
by whicn their noses may be restored to
their natural size. Dress yourself in the
garb of a physician, go to the castle and
state your errand. In the confusion you
will be easily admitted to the King's
presence.
"Then teil him for half his treasure, de
livered at the port of the city, you will re
store the noses of the royal family to
their original sizes. He then will order
his servants to deliver the sum you ask
and then you present to each member of
his family one of the large dates, with the
exception of to the King himself.
"Make an excuse of your supply giving
out and hurry away seemingly for more.
Then take snip and leave the old King to
enjoy bis long nose forever."
With these words Rosebud bade the
clown good-by, and he went on his way.
He had many narrow escapes from death
by wild beasts â one day killing a large
lion with his dagger. The sKin of this
animal served him as a warm covering at
night; with part of it he made a bag in
which he could carry water, and some
times he would frighten other wild beasts
away by throwing the skin over his head
to make believe he was the king of beasts.
Finally, after many hardships and after
suffering greatly at times from both hun
ger and thirst, he came to the desert in
which the two trees stood of whicn Rose
bud bad told him.
Filling his water-bag at a spring near
by, he started to cross the sandy plain,
and by sunrise the next day stood in the
shade of the wonderful palms.
Jumbo's curiosity led him to eat one of
the small dates, and, sure enough, his
nose grew so rapidly that he made baste
to duck and eat one from off the other
tree. "Oh. how sweet will be my re
venge," cried he, as he began to gather
the required number with which to per
form his purpose.
After a homeward journey free from ad
venture he arrived at the city's gates, aud
immediately was met by a messenger
from the ever faithful Rosebud.
By this messenger Jumbo sent his gift
of ten small dates to the palace, and when
the King saw the splendor of the dress of
the servant he thought, of course, they had
been sent to him by some royal personage,
and he and his wife and their sons ate
freely the delicious fruit. But, oh, what
was their horror to see that their noses
immediately grew to be of a tremendous
length.
In the midst of their distress, and while
the King was sending for all the great
healers of his realm. Jumbo, dressed as a
physician, appeared, claiming to be able
to cure the strange malady. He followed
the fairy's directions to the letter, and
soon had the satisfaction of seeing wagon
load after wagon-load of the King's treas
ure being taken to the port of the city,
where a large ship was waiting to carry
him faraway from the King's wrath.
Then he gave to each member of the
household one of the large dates, save to
the King, who became a little impatient;
but Jumbo quieted him by saying: "Oh,
my supply of remedy has been exhausted.
You must wait until I go for more."
With these words be hurriedly left,
To spin themselves
They have begun.
Round go the tops,
A dizzy whiri!
Round go the flyii g
Boy and girl!
Till who can see
Boy,- girl or top?
I wonder if
They'll ever stopl
chuckling to himself as he thought of the
King's queer apnearance.
Going rignt to the seashore, he found
the vessel ready to sail, and with a fond
farewell to his beloved Rosebud, who
promised some day to follow him. he left
lorever the country which ever since has
been ruled by a king whose nose is a yard
long.

Santa Claus'll come to-night,
If you're good,
And do what you know is right,
As you should;
Down the chimney he will creep.
Bringing you a woolly sheep,
Ana a doli that goes to sleepâ
If you're good.
Santa Claus will drive his sleigh
Through the wood,
But he'll come around this way
If you're good,
With a wind-up bird that sings,
And a puzzle made of rings-
Jumping- jacks and funny thingsâ
If you're good.
He will bring you cars that "go."
If you're good,
And a rocking-horseyâ oh!
If he would!
And a dolly, if you please,-
That says 'Mamma!" when yousqueete
It â he'll bring you one of these,
If you're good.
Santa grieves when you are bad,
As he should;
But It makes him very glad
When you're good.
He is wise, and he's a dear;
Just do right and never fear;
He'll remember you each year,
If you're good.

A hftWt
By Ethel Ferguson, 12 years old.
Three pink stockings were hanging from
the mantelpiece waiting for the coming
of Santa Claus, while the three golden
beads which belonged to the owners ol
those stockings were failed with wonderful
dreams of that same dear old Santa.
Suddenly the jingle, jingle of merry
Bleiehbells pealed out through the air.
Gradually the sweet sounds came nearer
and nearer until they were right over
head. Then there was a great clutter and
fuss, a shuffle in the chimney and there
was the jolly old elf standing in the
middle of the room.
He cautiously tiptoed to each tiny cot
to see if the shiny, mischievous eyes were
all tightly seaied, then with a soft little
chuckle he went to work to fill the stock
ings. His task done he scrambled up the
chimney, jumped into his sleigh and
hurried on bis way, bound to fill the
stockings of every good boy and girl in
the whole land while the stars were still
shining.
Just at dawn a little white figure flitted
across the room to the other cots and
whispered softly, "Ohwake up, Harry,
Santa Claus ha-! been here and left us
everything we wanted, and lots more be
sides 1"
Harry jumped out of bed in a jiffy and
he and Bessie were soon seated on the
floor, with their laps fuilof treasures.
Little Dotty was awakened by the com
motion and joined them, her face covered
with smiles as she saw the beautiful doll
which peeped from her own stocking.
After a little while nurse came in to
dress them, and soou they were bounding
down the stairs, shouting. -'Merry Christ
mas, papa! Merry Christmas, mamma!
Did Santa Claus put anything in your
stockings? Let's see."
After they had gone into raptures over
his gifts to their parents they sat down to
their breakfast, but could not eat much,
because they were so excited.
The morning passed very quickly, and
in the afternoon Uncle Jack came with his
little daughters.
Oh, what a fine time they had playing
with their new games and toys.
They were all very much surprised when
they heard the tinkle, tinkle of the din
ner bell, and left their beautiful play
things very unwillingly, but soon became
merry again at the sight of the lovely
table laden with goodies and glittering
with many-colored lights.
â¢â¢'After dinner they popped corn, roasted
apples, danced and sung, and then wound
up with a game of blind-man's buff, in
which the older folks all joined. "
Uncle Jack found it '; quite ; : difficult to
persuade his little girls that it was time to
go home when the clocks struck nine, but
finally good-nights wee â  all ''said, the
cousins gone, and Bessie, Harry and Dot
tie safe in bed, Dottie cuddling, in her
arms her precious doll, ; saying, "Santa

THE BEST TREE
Karl lay on the floor by the firelight bright
Thinking about the trees.
"I love them all," he said to himself,
As he named them over with ease;
"The chestnut, ash, and oak so high,
The pine with its needle leaves,
The spruce, and cedar, and hemlock green,
And the maple with its keys.
"The dainty willow with pussies gray,
The birch with bark so white,
The apple-tree with its blossoms sweet,
And the fruit so red and briuht.
But the one I love the best of all
Blooms and bears fruit together;
It is sure to be tilled at this time of the year,
Whatever may oe the weather.
"Its blossoms are blue and yellow and red,
All shining with silvery hue.
There are stems of golden and silver thread,
And candles that glisten like dew.
With such wonderful fruit there's none can
compare; ,
From lowest to topmost bough
Every sort of a toy is swinging in air-
Jumping frogs, and cats that 'me-ow. '
"There are trumpets, and balls, and dolls that
talk.
And drums, and whistles that blow,
And guns, and whips, and horses that walk,
And books; and wagons that go.
There are musical tops, and boats that sail,
And puzzles, ana knives, and games;
Ther.Â» are Noah's arks, and also a whale,
And boxes, and ribbons, and reins.
"There's candy and oranges, skates and sleds,
And mugs for good little girls,
And cradies, and clothes for dollies' beds,
And dolls with nair in curls.
There are fans for girl* and tools for boys,
And handkerchiefs, rattles, aDd ties,
And horns, and belts, and such-like toys,
And tea-sets aud candy pies.
"Oh ! what a sight is this wonderful tree.
With its gifts that sparkle and bide!
Other trees may be good, but there's none
for me
Like the beautiful merry Christmas-tree
With its branches spreading wide â
The merry, beautiful, sparkling tree
That blossoms at Christmas-tide."

m a aisunguisnea National statesman in i
V the course of an address delivered by him
some years ago at a famous banquet
given by one of the big Eastern munici
palities said : ' 'Cities are not made ; they
grow. All of the world's wealth spread
upon a square mile of ground situated in I
-he midst of the Sahara Desert would not
make a city."
The "commercial thoueht" has in view
something more than a mere aggregation
of structure!, no matter how costly they j
may be, when the word "city" is spoken, j
It is the difference between a quiet villa'
and a busy entrepot. Transportation
facilities are essential, of capacity and
accommodation, cheapness and celerity,
to make thorough and sufficient commu
nication with the most distant rural re
gions of production ; so that there is con
venient ease in dealing with the remote i
farm, the distant mine, as well as with the
nearer mili and manufactory. The trans
portation factor, viewed from a commer
cial standpoint, is one that enters more
largely into the determination of the suc
cess or failure of a '"city" than any other.
On it depends the growth or decay of both
importing and exporting and without it
in its best possible conditions a "city" is
an impossibility.
But given satisfactory transportation,
both of land and water, there is further
requisite something to transport, it may
be the products of agriculture, wheat,
corn, livestock, or any of the many pro
ductions of the farm and ranch. It may
be the output of the mine or the quarry.
It may be the varied products of the fac
tory, the loom and the workshop. It must
i-e something, something to trade in, and
4iierefore something to transport to and
1 om the place of trade.
" Given these two essential factorsâtrans
portation and material, there are yet
other elements necessary to form the com
pound Known as the "city." The opera
tion of trade with its concomitant trans
portation gives work to many men. To
the great majority wealth without per
sonal comfort is unsought. There must
be not only comfortable living; there must
be the ability to live economically amid
healthful environments and convenient
surroundings. The modern education
teaches many thines which were sadly
neglected in the early days of our coun
try's history. In nothing is the improve
ment more distinctly marked than in the
manner of living. Sanitary science is em- I
phatically modern.
One hundred years ago there were to be
found located upon European shores the
then great marts of the world's trade,
where business was transacted in dark,
gloomy and unhealtbful dens; where no
GIRL'S THRILLING SOMNAMBULISTIC FREAKS
Or\e Hundred ar\d Fifty Times She Stood or\ Death's Brirxk While
/Isleep ar\d as Often Was Miraculously Rescued.
A pretty girl is now being treated at the â 
Arapahoe County Hospital in Denver, j
who ha 3 broken the record for somnam- j
bulism. Her name is Annie Rossman,
and during her excursions while asleep \
:â  he has been rescued from injury or death '
by the police more than 150 times. Bolts,
bfers, handcuffs and chains all failed, to
keep her within her room, and clad in a
nightrobe she has roamed the streets of
A Denver night after night.
Everything possible was done to cure
ihe young woman of her strange mania,
but to no purpose until the was placed in
the hospital, where she has been care
fully watched by an attendant, and cold j
water thrown in her face every time she
sought to leaye her bed or escape. This |
plan seems to be proving efficacious, and j
for the present, at least, her sleep-walking
career has been brought to a close. The
story of her experiences is marvelous, and
there is no record of any man or woman
somnambulist who has undergone the

man knew the geological formation of the
street pavement, because of the accumu
lated filth of the century â commercial i
ports so malodorous that sea captains !
trading with them paid but small atten- !
tion to the lighthouses along the coast, ;
the sense of smell rising superior to that ;
of sight no matter what the direction of !
the wind. Things have very greatly
changed. The prestige of the ancient
maritime entrepots has departed, and
in the places of the old inconveniences are j
magnificent commercial exchanges, where |
modern common-sense combines health
with business and consequent pleasure in
the pursuit of the avocations of the count
less thousands engaged in barter and
trade. The "city" of to-day and to-mor
row demands the abiding presence of good
and clean streets, of an abundant supply
of pure water, of adequate and rapid tran
sit between the crowded commercial and
manufacturing quarters and the residence
suburbs; of ample parks and other breath
ing spots; of well-built, well-equipp d and
well-kept schools; of unstinted artificial
illumination (one good electric light is of
more value as a preventive of crime than
is the service- of two policemen). The
stately church, the splendid library, the
showy opera-house and the palatial resi
dence will each and all appear when con
ditions are favorable to their presence
in a city.
Given all these essential factorsof its ex
istence, the "city" will begin to demon
strate the wisdom of its founding.
Provided that its men of business are
blessed with a sagacity that recognizes
the value of a broad policy in their trans
actions with their fellow men, the "city"
will grow, and as time sweeps on the rep
utation of the "city" will assert itself at
the distant ends of the earth, with the re
sult that trade from distant places, over
continents and oceans, will, in obedience
to the most powerful law of human life,
the law of confidence, flow in increasing
volume and value to the recognized
"city."
The immense area of the United States
is too large to allow of its business be
ing centered in one city. It has more
over two distinct ocean boundaries, each
the exchange line of enormous traffic,
the commerce of the Atlantic and that of
the Pacific being markedly different one
from the other. It has also the gigantic
artery of trade running north and south
through its very center â the Mississippi
and tributaries. Its commerce is therefore
effected in its distribution very largely by
geographical features.
Plainly, then, there must always be re
quired for the proper transaction of trade
four great commercial centers in the

seems to be possessed of unusual intelli
gence, and her education is excellent. In |
appearance she is remarkably pretty, a j
perfect specimen of a blonde. She is both
striking in physique and comely in feature.
It is almost marvelous to consider the j
methods that have been unsuccessfully j
adopted to restrain her from her nocturnal i
excursions. The windows of her room j
have been locked and the key to the door
bidden, but to no purpose. So far as tha
hiding-place of the key is concerned she
has always seemed possessed ol almost
supernatural powers, for if the key was
hidden in her owu room she invariably
found it. When the door was locked from
the outside she managed to cleverly pick
the lock and make her way to the street. J
At other times she has been tied in her
bed bo securely that it seemed as if in no
way would she be able to release herself.
In this regard she has exhibited the skill
of the conjurer, for no knot could be tied
that she was unable to loosen and no mat
ter how the ropes were arranged, she
always found a way to release herself.
Handcuffs have been attached to her
wrists and then chained to the bed, but

We rind this experience asserting itself
| in happy location as best answering the
; geographical needs of our trade in the i
plain when she awoke. In a waking condi
tion she could never perform the feat. At
another time the key to her room was
placed in the bottom of a barrel of water
that rested in one corner of her apart
ment, but she secured the key and the
contact with the chilled fluid did not
awaken her. There has been no particu
lar method which she has followed in her
walks about the city, and contrary to the
general idea regarding somnambulists,
she has rarely seemed to have a definite
idea of doing any particular thing on any
occasion.
About the only instance when she dis
tinctly remembered having a purpose in
view was the time when she was found
seated on a letter-box with her arm around
the lamp-iiost, when she declared she had
believed herself to be seated on a rail at
the theater with her arm about one of the
supporting pillars. This fact of general
lack of intention is all the more singular
because of the accepted belief that the
act.ons of sleep-walkers are merely the
fulfillment of dreams that have seized
upon them.
One of the most narrow escapes she has
had, if not the narrowest of all, was on
the occasion of a trip she is supposed to
have started on to North Denver. She
cities of New York, Chicago, Denver and
San Francisco.
That in course of time the two seaboard
cities will outstrip their other sisters is
a matter hardly requiring argument.
Under present conditions a very large
amount of merchandise passes through
both Chicago and Denver without tran
shipment, and with improved facilities a
still greater percentage of it will do so In
the future. But until some coming genius
shall have discovered a means whereby a
railroad train may traverse the ocean and
reached the bridge which crosses Cherry
Creek by the old City Hall, but, instead of
crossing the structure, made her way
down by its side, and apparently started
for a walk through the water. It so hap
pened that the creek was not "booming"
to any great extent just then, and a po
liceman happened to see her action and
rescued her from drowning. Even the
shock of the water did not fairly waken
her, and it was several moments after her
rescue before she entirely regained con
sciousness.
It has always happened that whenever
Miss Kossman left her room and home at
night on one of these sleep-walking trips
she has never stopped to don any
clothing beside the night robe, and has
been guiltless of shoes or stockings. Just
how she could so often make her way
about Denver's streets in this costume un
observed is a matter of almost as much
mystery as the real cause of the affliction
which has rendered her miserable for
eight years.
One night a few months ago, when she
was living at Twenty-first and California
streets, she left her home about midnight
and wandered down Twenty-first to Curtis
street. When in front of the Curtis-street
nosehoase a Twenty-second-street cable
car came upon her unexpectedly, and she
was knocked down and to one side, en
tirely escaping injury, except a few slight
bruises. As usual, she was c.ad only in
her night robe. She was picked up and
taken into the hosehouse and returned to
her home in the ambulance.
One night not Jong ago she walked from
her home clear down to the Union railway
station. This time, however, .she had lain
down without removing her clothing, and
so attracted less attention. She sat in the
station awhile, where her peculiar actions
were noted, but there was no suspicion
that she was asleep. Finally she went to
the ticket agent's window and bought a
ticket for Cheyenne. Then she left the
station, made her way to the railroad
tracks, divested herself of most of her
clothing, and walked up the track toward
the approaching train. Fortunately the
engineer saw her in time to stop before he
reached her, although she was walking
toward the locomotive all the time.
Again she made her way down to Six
teenth street one evening, or rather early
in the morning; when there were quite a
number of heavy wagons passing up tho
street, and calmly walked in front of one
of the largest that was going west at a
lively gait. The driver saw her and pulled
up his horses, but she would certainly
have been badly injured had not a police
man seen her just in time and pulled her
fairly from beneath the horses' feet. She
was not even scratched.
The greatest danger which she ever en
countered, even greater than in the Cnerry
Creek incident, was one lime when she at
tempted to leave her room located in the
third story of her home, via the window.
She crept through the window, having
raised the lower sash, prid grasping the
sill with both bands, swung herself out.
As fortune would have it a policeman
happened to be passing almost at thÂ«
moment and saw what she had done. He
made his way into the house, rushed up
stairs, broke in the door of her room ana
seizing her by the wrists pulled her back
into the apartment. Not until she was
again m her own room did she realize
what had happened.
Once after she had left her home on one
of these trips she apparently imagined
herself a lineman, for she essayed climb
ing a telegraph-pole and succeeded in
making her way well toward the top be
fore she was discovered. She was resting
in this fashion, near the top of the pole,
when a policeman happened to see her.
Miss Rossman is a native of Pecola,
Kans., and a number of members of her
family now reside there. When she first
began to walk in her sleep the attacks
were not frequent, and it was only -after
she became a resident of Denver that her
mania grew upon her. It is believed this
was due to the air that is found at the high
altitude in which Denver is located.
Physicians who have studied Miss Ross
man's case say that her trouble is largely
due to the sluggish condition of her blood.
During the time she is under the influence
of somnambulism her face is almost as
pale and cold as that of a person who is
dead. Sbe is certainly the most interest
ing sleep-walker whose actions are re
corded in medical history.

STRANGEST OF ALL LATTER-DAY CRUSADES
Jhe Ghmese Movement to GorWert /imericarvs to the Beliefs of
Gor\fuciusâ Prophets Who Foretell a Religious JfeVolutiorv
The strangest crusade which the United
States ever knew is about to begin. It is
nothing less than an attempt to convert
the citizens of this county to Confucian
ism. The leader of this odd movement is
Wong Chirm Fooof 309 South Clark street,
Chicago. Not only will he seek to make
us all good Chinamen, but he proposes to
secure the erection by the chilly shores
of LaKe Michigan of a magnificent tem
ple, in which all those who believe in the
doctrines of Confucius may worship.
This will be no joss-house, but a bona
ride temple tilted up in the most approved
fashion. All the various details which
go to make op the gorgeous interior of
the temple to which the disciples of Con
fucius turn their footsteps will be there
in great degree. In fact, if the plan of
Wong Chirm Foo is carried out, tliere will
be a sample of oriental gorgeousness such
as the prosaic United Stales has never
before possessed within its borders. Nei
ther will there be any ceremony omitted.
Every point that the strictest Chinese
etiquette requires to be observed will be
always taken into consideration. To slight
even one of them would bean unpardon
able error. While in China the offender
would be behead d, in this land of the
free and the home of the brave be woutd
merely be escorted out of doors.
The light of intelligence shines brightly
about Wong Chirm Foo, for he is a genuine
WONG CHINN EXPECTS AMERICANS TO WORSHIP LIKE THIS.
American citizen and has papers to prove
it. The loss of his cue, however, has not
interfered with his native religious meth
ods, for he is just as good a believer in the
doctrines of Confucius as he ever was, and
that is saying a good deal. He is the edi
tor of a Chinese newspaper in Chicago,
and spreads his ideas among his country
men as rapidly as possible. The plan for
a temple is not an inspiration, so far as he
is concerned, but it seems that it has been
talked of and dreamed about for many
years, both by himself and others of his
race.
Wong Chirm Foo has no desire to hide
his intentions under a bushel, any more
than he has his light, as the following
written by him shows:
"To the Editor: It is my purpose to do
j people living east of the Rocky Mountains
have cited the report of the California
State Board of Health to bolster up the
assertion that consumption is California's
most deadly enemy. The facts in the case
effectually disprove all such foolish state
ments. The crucial test ol the healthful
ness or unhealthfulness of a city is its
death rate, and, in giving proper value to
such evidence, the rate of mortality must
not be taken for a short perio-i of time; it
must be observed over a lengthy period of
years. Extraordinary seasonal changes
all that 1 can to make all Americans good
Confucianists and Chinamen. Many of
my countrymen will aid me in this way.
I am veiy much in earnest and mean just
what I say when I declare that there will
be built a temple to Confucius. This will
show how intelligent people can live with
out superstition and religion, how they
can love one auother and do away with
bigotry, conceit and red-tape methods of
doing good.
"It will also show the Christian families
how to bring up their young to respect old
age and their parents, and will encourage
general social order in communities. Ail
these things were done in China for
centuries, and it is these that kept its im
mense millions in order and prosperity.
Why cannot the belief of Confucianists
be introduced into the United States
just as well as the good qualities of the
Americans have been introduced into
China I believe in reciprocity in all
thines.
"The Chinese are not in this country to
be bad citizens, although none of them
truly believe in Christianity. ThÂ«Â» Chi
nese News is for the Americanizing of the
Chinese in the United States. It is to try
to tench them patriotism, a thing almost
entirely unknown to the Chinese cooly.
I am a great admirer of everything
American, as I am a naturalized citizen
of this glorious and beautiful Republic.
Chinamen should not be old fogies, and I
am preparing their minds not to be.
"Wong Chirm Foo."
It has always been the case that even
among the better class of Chinese a
strong feeling has existed against the in
sistent attempts of the American mission
ary to evangelize at least a portion of
China's unbelieving millions. It was sup
posed for a time that this crusade against
Christianity was really a retaliatory move
ment, calculated to inspire terror in the
hearts of missionaries. No one paid any
attention to the matter, however, believ
ing it to be a mere threat.
Now, however, the movement appears
to have taken a definite state. Certainly
the Chinese of this country are wealthy
enough to make a decided stir, and if they
and abnormal conditions may cause an in*
crease or a diminution in the death rate
for a brief period, which is eliminated
when the rate is taken for a fairly lengthy
time. The accompanying table, compar
ing the death rates of five of the principal
and best sanitarily managed cities in the
United States, covering a period of from
ten to twenty years, establishes conclu
sively that San Francisco is the most
healthful of all. It so satisfactorily a re
sult has attained under the old sanitary (?)
system of the Golden Gate City, what may
not be reasonably looked for under the
administration of a thoroughly modern
Banitary system of municipal control?
As a matter of fact, the healthful con
ditions of San Francisco are not only un
excelled, they are unequaled by those
possessed by any interior portion of the
continent. They could not be otherwise
so long as the revolution of the earth
upon her axis causes the winds to blow
from the bosom of the broad Pacific
ninety days out of every hundred. It is
because of the established reputation of
California for its healthful, invigorating
and restoring climate that the death rate,
on account of consumption, is as high as
it is. Fully '25 per cent of the deaths from
all causes are due to the presence in our
midst of broken-down invalids from the
Eastern States and foreign lands, who
have come here in the pursuit of health,
but â came too late to mend.
With a truer knowledge of the condi
tions the situation is becoming better un
derstood, and San Francisco, to which all
roads to California first lead the feeble
footsteps of the invalid, is to-day recog
nized as one of the most healthful cities
upon the continent.
The foundations of her greatness are
thus laid down. Healthful living. The
central point for the mining, the agri
cultural and the horticultural products of
the vast Pacific Slope. The colossal en
trepot of the occidental trade. The shin
ing rails of steel may come and kiss the
dancing waves of the golden ocean, but
there the poetry ends and the very plain
prose begins. Between the rails and the
waves there must be a big, strong bridge
over which the commerce of the rails and
waves will have to pass, and that bridge is
what is called a commercial seaport. That
San -Francisco will become the greatest
seaport of the world is a problem that can
only be delayed of affirmative solution hy
the exercue of the blindest disregard of
business principles, a condition which ia
not now nor ever likely to be found in the
City which graces the finest harbor in the
world, having opposite to its mouth three
fifths of all the world's commerce.
F. M. Close, D.Sc.
heartily unite in the movement there la
no question but that an evangelistic cam*
paign, such as the world has never seen,
will be inaugurated. It is not likely to be
a project of mushroom growth, for the
Celestial mind moves slowly although
with great certainty. The predominating
element among the Chinese of this coun
try is, of course, what Is considered in
China itself the lowest caste. Therefore,
the crusade, to be on a firm foundation,
must have the backing of the intelligent
Chinamen of good birth.
It will be remembered that at tha
World's Congress of Religion held in Chi
cago during the Columbian Exposition
there were gathered representatives of
nearly every religious belief that could
boast of any considerable number of fol
lowers throughout the world. Notabla
among the delegates to the congress was a
Buddhist priest from India, an ascetic
appearing, dignified individual, who com
manded the sincere respect and admiration
of those who listened to his words or be
came personally acquainted with him.
During his stay in this country he suc
ceeded in inducing several persons to
accept the Buddhist doctrine on the ground
that it was really the most ancient and tha
surest exemplification of the principles
upon which the foundation of that belief
which the world recognizes as Christian*
ity is based.
Taking these facts into consideration,
the plan of the Chicago Chinaman is not
to be lightly spoken of, because if the In
dian Buddhist priest could, unaided and
quietly, secure recognition of the princi
ples he represented, ihere would seem no
reason to doubt the ability of an organized
Chinese contingent to make at least small
progress along the line in which its efforts
were directed.
The theosophists hold that 1897 will
bring to a close one of the cycles that are
rounded out each thousand years. They
further declare that this period means to
the world great religions changes. It may
be that the introduction of Confucianism
into the United States is one of those
events which it is promised shall aston
ish the world.

they make a much bigger dustheap than
any one would imagine from seeing
Palmer Cox's sketches. The Brownies- at
the Baldwin are all very tine and large,
just like the California-grown fruit and
flowers, that reach abnormal proportions
under these genial skies. The worst of it
is that no one wants to measure .Brownies
by the yard or by the pound avoirdupois.
Most ot us seem to have imagined them
to be quaint little elves, small enough to
repose on a toadstool, and now on Palmer
Cox's own authority we find them to be of
the normal stature of the sons of men,
with nothing much to distinguish them
from humans, except that they have
white rings round their eyes and appear
to be suffering from an acute attack of
dropsy.
Of course it was worse than visionary to
dream for a moment that Brownies, as
Palmer Cox bad pictured them, could be
put on the stage. If Brownies exist and
could be induced to sign theatrical con
tracts, there would be too much money
in showing them as sideshows for
any manager to be extravagant enough to
exhibt them in bands. But as the little
fellows exist only in imagination, mock
Brownies are the natural result of trying
to embody Palmer Cox's quaint ideas in
dramatic form. I was not the only one,
though, who murmured after seeing them
on Thursday night, "Another illusion
gone!"
, As a spectacular extravaganza, and not
as an embodiment of Palmer Cox's
sketches, "The Brownies" is well worth
seeing. If children .had money, the
"standing-room only" sign would be out
every night. One of the prettiest scenes
is that where the Brownies serenade the
moon, on luminous mandolins, and the
orb of night dismisses them by putting on
a nightcap inscribed with the legend,
"Good night." The German Band scene
is very funny, though the point of its
humor can only be fully appreciated by
people who have spent days and nights of
torture at British watering-places, haunted
even in their dreams by the strains of the
Ã¼biquitous and discordant German band.

Daniel Fraw'ey says that when his com
pany sailed away from Honolulu the
other day, every dressmaker, modiste and
milliner in town came to see them off and
wish them a speedy return, for never since
the flourishing days of King Kalakaua
had there been so much work for the
artists who make toilets and confections.
"The ladies dressed for the theater just as
if we had been the Bchoeffel _ Grau com
pany," said Frawley, "and the strangest
thing was that even the strictest members
of the missionary set received us at their
homes and came to the theater en toilette."
But it was not the regret of the modistes
that touched Frawley on leaving the
islands; it was the mute farewell of the
Royal Hawaiian band. The Quee n's court
musicians never would swear allegiance to
the new Republic, so Mr. Dole got a band
of his own, and the court players, finding
their occupation gone, set out for a tour of
the United Siates. They ended their
checkered career in this country at
Gustav "Walter's Orpheum here, and
returned home covered with glory, while
the Frawleys were playing in Honolulu.
Feasting, rejoicing and dancing cele
brated the homecoming of the Royal
band, and the Republican band, that bad
not been feasted or rejoiced or danced
over, began to feel the pangs of jealousy,
though the musicians took a grim com
fort in the reflection that their music was
too classical to call forth popular demon
strations. "The Republican band was
playing for us at the opera-house, and
they insisted on giving us heavy Wag
nerian pieces when we wanted Hawaiian
airs," said Frawley.
He not only asked for Hawaiian airs,
but saw that he got them by engaging the
Royal band ;or the end of his season.
This was a triumph for the court musi
cians, and when the Frawley company
went away the members of the band
begged permission to show their grati
tude by playing them off. Application
was made to the authorities, but the per
mission was firmly refused on the ground
that the Republican band plays the
steamers off. "May we sing for you on
the wharf?" asked the Royal musicians,
but the Republican band would not hear
of such a thing, so^singing was strictly
prohibited. Frawiey says he was really
touched by the sight of the musicians,
who had played so sweetly for his com
pany, waving farewell, but forbidden even
to sing a sad aloha, while their triumph

The Frawiey company, just arrived
from a successful season in Honolulu,
will be the holiday offering at the Colum

Frawley calls his troupe, will only per
form tor two weeks. During their absence
they have had in preparation Augustin
Daly's adaptation of Schoenthan and Ka

and they will prpduce it to-ni. rrow night.
The story of the play explains how Lieu

made in "The Cricket on the Hearth,"
based on Dickens' beautiful story. There
will be thirty children in the "vision"
scene, and the best members of the stock
company will be in the cast. Mr. Peery

The bill at the Orpheum for this week
promises to be one of the best that Gustav
Walter has yet put into his music hall.
A flying ballet and a grand opera ballet
will be seen on the same stage and at tbe
same time. Nilsson's aerial ballet will be
the sensational feature. While the aerial
ballet is working in midair, Kiralfy's bal

Zazella and Vernon, comedy acrobats, i
will appear in fanny work; Ed Heffernan, 1
the Irish monoioguist, will return for one

A SOCIETY ACTRESS
fliss Frances Jolliffe Will J^lake
Her Sarv Francisco Debut
Next J^onth Under
J^odjeska.
When Mme. Modje-ka opens her se*son
at the Baldwin Theater in January, the
ingenue of her troupe will be Miss Frances
Jolliffe, a young San Francisco society
cMrl, who made up her mind over a year
ago to adopt the stage as a profession.
Miss Jolliffe is a warm personal friend of
Mme. Modjeska and her first appearance
on any public stage was made thirteen
months ago as a member of the Modjeska
troupe in New York. Afterward she
joined the Daly troupe, but her family,
which has always been ouposed to her go
ing on the stage, induced her to return
home and since then she has been "rest
ing," as they say in theatrical parlance.
When an aspiring actress "rests," how
ever, it is not a case o' doing nothing and
doing it well. Miss Frances Jolliffe said
yesteroay that she had spent her time
since the spring in reading, studying and
trying to conform to clock-work regula
tions in eating and drinking an<t walking
and sleeping. "When I was in New York
I had no one to compel me to De precise,"
she said. "I slept wlien I was sleepy and
ate when I was hungry, but I soon found
that absolute system was necessary to
withstand the wear and tear of studying
and acting, so when I came home I re
fused nearly all invitations and led the
simplest kind of life, just to take care of
my strength and practice the system of
daily work that I mean to adopt in my
professional life.
"I realize all the hard work that lies be
fore an actress. Oh, yes, don't imagine
that I deiude myself on that score, but I
believe in huving a profession, and I have
always had a passion for acting, ever since
I was a little thing so high," and the
debutante indicated a point about three
feet from the ground. "I used to drill my
sisters into dramatic clubs, but we never
performed for any one but ourselves."
"When did you first recite in public?"
was asked.
"I never recited, not even at graduating
exercise*," replied Miss Frances Jolliffe.
"It was when I was at college at Vassar
that I first took a little part in a play, and
tne prolessors were so pleased that they
asked me to be the star in a Greek play.
We aced it before over 2000 people, and I
received so many letters of congratulation
from actors and celebrated professors of
elocution thatâ well, no! I did not
really think of going on the stage then,
although they advised me strongly to do
so, but after I had left college I thought it
over more and more, and at last a cele
brated manager gave me such encourage
ment that I made up my mind to adopt
the stage as a profession.
"No ! 1 would rather not say who the
manager was, but he is one of the best
known and most successful manaLers in
the country. He took me to Professor
Sarjeant in New York, who had seen the
Greek play at Vassar, and the professor's
greeting was": 'Ah! I knew you'd come
back sooner or later.' He had predicted
that I should go on the stage and proved
to be a true prophet, for I joined the Mod
jeska Company soon after."
Miss Frances Jolliffe gave up her career
in New York last spring on account of
her mother's illness. She has never ap
peared in San Francisco, and her family is
so well known here, and she personally
has so many friends, that her debut at
the Baldwin on January 25 will be quite
a social event. She says she would rather
be seen first in a li'.tle part, because, as
she explained, "I have not been on the
stage for over six months and want to
overcome my nervousness before playing
a prominent role."
The prettiest part that Miss Frances Jol
liffe will play during her engagement here
is that of Marie, the little sister in Snder
mann's drama, that Mapda's wayward
heart yearns over, when she returns home
famous, but an outcast in the eyes of her
father. Miss Jolliffe's personality ought
to make her a charming Marie. She is a
handsome brunette, about the middle
height, slender and graceful, and her
regular leatures are molded in those clear
cut lines which are so effective on the
stage.
Iv discussing actresses the debutante
confessed that her ideal of perfection was
Elenora Duse: "I had seen so many
Marguerite Gauthiers before I saÂ«r hers,"
she remarked, enthusiastically, "but Duse
made something new and beautilul out of
the old 'Dame aux Canielias.' There were
moments when I shut my eyes and shrank
away, for it seemed an impertinent intru
sion for me to be gazing into the secrets of
another woman's soul. That's what I
felt all through with Duse, and she made
me look into my own soul, too."
When asked whether she hoped to play
the Duse repertoire herself Miss Jolliffe
said : "I shall take whatever part is offered
me and find out gradually what I am capa
ble of doing. I do not wish to be an
actress with a yearning for tragedy who is
forced to play comedy all her life, or vice
versa. All I can do is to work and have
as few predilections as possible. Shall I
continue on the stage? Yes. I hope to
go on acting steadily henceforth, but my
friends are opposed to it, and it's hard,
very hard, to stand alone against every
one."

The milk bath is the latest fad for actresses,
it seems, who want perpetual beauty, or per
petual advertisement, whichever it is. Just as
soon as Anna Held imported this idea of course
it had to become popular.
William A. Brady offered the role of leading
iady in "The Polar Star" to the clever young

owing to her mother's illness she declined it.
She is at present traveling in Europe and is

Gustav Walter says that the Cherry Sisters
are so excruciatingly grotesque as to be al
most artists. He rind gome thoughts of secur
ing them for the Orpheum, but they refuse to
play under $500 a week, and he does not
think them worth that figure, witn traveling
expenses, etc.
Not many days ago Miss Georgia Cayvan was
a guest at the White House. Her manager, ac
cording to a story, patted himself upon the
back and in a wild state of excitement began
to prepare accounts of Miss Cayvan's state
visit for the newspapers. Whereupon the
lady of the many heroines sat upon the
scheme. She would not trade upon her ac
quaintance with Mrs. Cleveland, she e_ id, even
in the interest of loved publicity.
The question that troubles the advance
agent 01 the moment is this: Was the mana
ger's plan for (retting the announcement
n print better than Miss Cayvan's?

Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the Interior
and low along the coas:, and the Isobars extend !
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of

the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer

FINDS GOLD AND
CAN`T TOUCH IT
An Artisan Discovers a
Rich Ledge in This
City.
In a Public Street, but He Can
Get No Authority to
Work It
Keeping the Location a Secret and
at a Loss How to Realize
on His Find.
An intelligent artisan residing in this
City has discovered in one of the public
streets of this City a ledge of rich ore,
and he is in a quandary how he
may profit by it, for the thoroughfare is
the City's and the neighboring property
belongs to urivate persons.
II he divulge the location of the vein
chances or ever prospecting it or deriving
benefit from it seem to him small.
His long experience in the Cceur d'Alene
mining district prompted him when he first
saw the rock several weeks ago to think
seriously that it was the right stuff, al
though to the ordinary obseryer the re"d
dish-colored decayed quartz appears of no
value. All th.s time he carefully guarded
his secret, while he tried to devise some
means of realizing upon what he became
more firmly convinced was a good thing.
Yesterday he had some of the surface
cropplngs assayed and this i 3 what the
assay showed: Goid ounces to the ton, 60;
gold value a ton, $12 40; silver ounces to
the ton, 4; silver value a ton, $2 bO; total
value a ton, $15. And miners consider the
surface of a ledge ; ess ricti than that fur
ther down.
This ledge is, so the finder asserts, fully
sixteen iucnes thick, the stratum is tilted
at an angle of about forty-rive degrees and
crosses the street diagonally. How far it
extends or to what depth it reaches he
cannot tell without prospecting. He can
not prospect without obtaining permission
and in applying for the privilege he must
divulge his secret, arrd there's the rub.
No one has a right to mine the public
streets, and probably nothing but a
special act of the Legislature could em
power the Board of Supervisors to grant
such a privilege. The rights of the prop
eity in the street and to that in a private
lot lie in the municipality or with the in
dividual possessing the patent title to the
land and all under it through to the cen
ter of the earth.
Were a prospect possible to de
termine the exact location and extent
of the ledge the discoverer might
buy the adjacent property, sink
a shaft to a safe depth, branch out
and crosscut the ledge far below, then fol
low its course, guarding the entrance to
the tunnel and taking out ore presumably
from his own lot, for all the other prop
erty-owners might know of the location
of the vein* But unfortunately for this
carpenter he is not possessed of an abund
ance of coin and is in* much the same posi
tion as an inventor at the mercy of capital
needed for developing his aevice.
While the finder is trying to solve the
problem of getting at his known gold
mine other persons may be daily walking
or living over it unawares.
There have been other discoveries of ore
in this City, but noue so rich or so ex
tensive as this appears to be. Some time
since John McCarty, the contractor, dis
covered a ledge of quicksilver on a lot at
the corner of McAllister and Devisadero
streets, and had to abandon it wnen it led
into the public street. The inconveniences
of tne location and the necessary extra
expenses of mining in the City made the
undertaking unfeasible. In 1888 the State
Mining Bureau took specimens of ore
from the hillside on Liberty street, and
their assay showed $7 a ton.
On anotner occasion a fine body of
manganese ore was found on a part of
Guerrero street well built up with sub
stantial houses that rendered the develop
ment of a mine impracticable.
A number of years ago the cold fever
struck North Beach and numerous claims
were quickly staked out on bright surface
indications that subsequently proved to
be nothing but brass filings from a neigh
boring brass foundry. A printer in the
early days of :he Alta California picked
up a small bit of quartz on Twin Peaks
one Sunday and in it was a gold nugget
the size of a large bean. Such are the
records of the mineral discoveries in this
city known to the State Mining Bureau.
More recently there bave been several
supposed finds â one near lngleside aud
one on Geary streew
STRUGGLE FOR HIS LIFE.
Durrant's Cane Will Come Up in the
Supreme Court To-Mor
row.
The Durrant case will come up in the
Bupreme Court to-morrow. The Attorney-
General has prepareJ his brief in answer
to the briefs of Durrant's attorneys in an
ticipation of the possible setting aside of
the order of submission by the court. The
main argument will not take place to

promise to be interesting nevertheless. If
the order of submission is set asioe the
aeiense win have ten days or more in
which to file an answer to the Attorney-
General. Then the real and final struggle
lor a new trial for Durrant will toke place.
The Attorney-General has nad the brief
of Durrant's attorneys to consider. It has
not been filed, but is in the office of the
clerk of the Supreme Court ready for
filing. The brief of the Attorney-General
is long and all the leading points made
for the defense are aifet.

Mrs. Fennell Lays a Serious Charge
Against O'Brien & Song.

mand for the return of her property or for
$6350, the value thereof, as well as for $250

ENGLAND OWNER
OF CHRIST'S TOMB
The Rev. Haskett Smith's
Story of the Real
Calvary.
It Is a Remarkable Mound just
Outside the Damascus
Gate.
Explorations and Discoveries by a
Noted Man of Lettersâ Has Been
in Australia.
Some very interesting particulars con
cerning his life and work in the Holy
Land and the Orient generally were given
a Call representative last evening by the
Rev. HasKett Smith, the world-famed.
Orientalist, author and lecturer, who is at
present at the Hotel Ramona.
One of the most interesting and remark
able results of his researches and investi
gations in Palestine'bas been the publica
tion of a small pamphlet entitled "Calvary
and the Tomb of Christ," which created
an enormous amount of interest and en
thusiasm in England, and of which over
20,000 copies have been sold. In this
monograph, which originally appeared as
an article in Murray's Magazine, Mr. Has
kett Smith conclusively proves that
the traditional site of our Lord's cruci
fixion and burial at the 80-called Church
of the Holy Sepulcher, "is indubitably
false and fictitious, and that the real Cal
vary is a remarkable mound just outside
the Damascus gate," in the northern walls
of Jerusalem.
In the face of this mound, composed as
it is of the hardest and most unfnable
Kind of nummulite limestone, is still
clearly to be seen an exact resemblance to
a skull, which natural feature douotiess
caused the hill to be known in Jewish
days as "Golgotha," or the "place of a
skull."
The Jews of Jerusalem to the present
day hold this hill accursed and call it the
place of execution. They will under no
circumstances pass the spot after night
fall, and even during the daytime they in
variably mutter a curse as they go by the
mound, the words of the imprecation be
inc, "Cursed be he that destroyed our
nation by aspiring to be its King!"
The hill stands at the junction of what
always have beep, and still are, the two
main roads outside Jerusalem, the one
northward through the country of Pales
tine to Damascus, and the other from
west to east from the Mediterranean to
the Jordan.
It mast have been near tbese public
roads, wbere tbere would be many casual
passers-by, that Christ must have been
crucified ; for we read that "all they that
passed by reviled him." These and sev
eral other arguments are exhaustively
dealt with in Haskett Smith's work, and
the general consensus of unprejudiced and
intelligent authorities on the subject now
accepts this hill as the true site of Calvary.
Into the side of this hill there runs a gar
den, and there are the clearest possible in
dications that this was the garden of
.Joseph of Arimathea. At the north end
of this garden, in the rocky face ot tlfS
"Skull Hill," is a rockcut tomb or sepui

mas presents Each
cher, which has been hidden from sight
for many centuries, owing to the accumu
lation of debris which had gathered
over ana around it, principally through
the devastation resulting upon the destruc
tion of Jerusalem by the Romans.
This tomb has been carefully cleared
out and thoroughly explored, and, as
Haskett Smith snows, it bears unmistaka
ble evidence of being the actual tomb Of
Christ. It is a Jewish tomb; it was meant
for a Jew of wealth and importance; it
was of the Herodias type, showing that it
must have been excavated at about the
time of our Lord; it was never really fin
ished, and was evidently occupied hur
riedly, and it is the only tomb which has
yet been discovered where the events as
recorded in the twentieth chapter of St.
John could possibly have occurred.
It was a bold attempt to overthrow the
unbroken tradition of nearly sixteen cen
turies, implicitly accepted by universal
Christendom, but Haskett Smith very
clearly demonstrated how the true site of
Calvary and the tomb were lost, owing to
the action of the Emoeror Adrian, who
expelled all Jews and Christians from Je
rusalem in the year 130 A. D., converting
the city into a heathen Roman city,
changing its name to Aelia Capitolinaand
careiully destroying as far as possible all
Jewish and Christian sacred spots and
edifices.
For tbree generations â for close upon
100 yearsâ no Christians were allowed to
enter Jerusalem, and when at length they
were permitted to return there was no one
living who knew the city in its former
condition. The consequence was that
when the Empress Helena, mother of
Constantino the Great, went to Jerusalem
In the year 323 A. D., with the express
purpose of building a church over the
scene of our Lord's crucifixion and burial,
there was not a soul who could tell where
the true site was.
The ecclesiastical tradition is that in
this dilemma Helena had a miraculous
dream, in which a certain spot In Jerusa
lem was pointed out to her and she was
told that if she dug there she would find
beneath the surface three buried wooden
crosses; that these were the crosses of
Christ and of the two thieves and that
they had been buried there by the first
disciples in order that they might be pre
served as sacred relics and that no one
should be able to discover where they
were burled.
The Empress, though an extremely de
vout and holy woman, was, like most peo
ple of her age, fanatical, ignorant and
superstitious in the highest degree. She
was surrounded by a body of sycophantic
and unscrupulous followers, whose one
duty was to satisfy all the old lady's de
sires, and, therefore, when she told her
dream to them, it is not very surprising
that a couple of days afterward, when she
had the spot which she had dreamed of
dug open, three wooden crosses, were
found. On the strength of this supposed
miraculous discovery the Church of the
Holy Bepulcher was erected on the spot,
and ever since that time, strange to say,
no one seems to have ventured to discuss
or dispute tho genuineness of the site un
til the intelligent and painstaking re
searches of the Palestine explorers during
the last thirty years have effectually ex"
posed the fallacy of the tradition.
All this is most ably and interestingly
cealt with in Haskett Smith's "Calvary
and the Tomb of Christ," and a vary
practical and important issue has resulted
from the publication of his work. It was
felt by a large number of influential and
earnest people in England that the parden
and tomb, surrounded by such sacred as
sociations, should, if possible, be secured
by purchase, so as to be preserved forever
from desecration on the one hand and
from superstition on the other. Accord
ingly a committee was formed in London,
under the patronage of the late ArcD
bishop of Canterbury and of seven of the
leading Anglican bishops, and funds were
raisod for tne purchase of the property.
Mr. Haskett Smith was deputed by the
committee to go to Jerusalem for the pur
pose of negotiating with the owner of the
property, and after many obstacles, de
lays ana drawbacks the matter was finally
brought to a successful issue, the property
purchased for $10,000, or Â£2000, and before
he left lor Australia in February, 1895,

J. A. FILLMORE IS SICK
The Southern Pacific Manager
Attacked by Pneu
monia.
Cod fined to His Home for More Than
a Week-He Is Now Seri
ously I 1.
J. A . Fillmore, manager of the Pacific
division of the Southern Pacific Company,
is seriously ill at his home in this city.
For a week he has been confined to his
house and yesterday did not leave his bed.
The trouble is an attack of Dneumonia fol
lowing a very heavy cold which settled on
Mr. Fillmore's cbest a week ago.
Since some time the week before last the
railroad manager's desk has been closed
and his work has devolved upon the as
sistant manager. At first it was thought
Mr. Fillmore's indisposition was of a mild
nature, simply a common cold, though a
really severe one. As the days passed it
developed into an acute form until at last
pneumonia began to show itself.
Wednesday last Mrs. Fillmore, who was
in the East, started for home and is now
coming westward as fast as possible to be
with her husband, .whose condition was
said to be critical yesterday.
At the railroad offices the fact of Mr.
JnllmoreY sickness was kept secret, al
though on the street several railway men
knew of it. The news was a great surprise
to them. One agent stated that while Mr.
Fillmore's condition was said to be not of
a nature that would cause any uneasi
ness among his friends, it really was seri
ous. He said that pneumonia had come
upon a very bad cold and prostrated Mr.
Filimore completely.
Assistant Manager Foster made light of
the manager's illness. "It is only a heavy
cold," said he, "and Mr. Fillmore will be
out again next week, but there is no dan
ger. The doctor fears pneumonia which
threatened him this morning and Mr.
Fill more is in bed to-day."

Now Here.
Bought Many Lccomotives and
Much Steel From the United
States This Year.
Will Examine Oar Elevated Systems
and Railway Suppliesâ Got
3000 Miles of Road.
The great city of Tokio is soon to be I
gridironcd with elevated railroads.
11. Notnnara, a special commissioner of
the Japanese Government to investigate
'different elevated systems in America and
Europe, arrived here yesterday. He is ac
companied by three other prominent
Japanese gentlemen, who are investi
gating different railroad problems.
H. Iwasaki is one of them. He is* super
intendent of locomotives of two private
railroad lines, and is here on business in '
connection with railway locomotives. S.
Yamaguchi is also commissioned by the
Government on railway matters, and K. !
Takibe is here to study locomotive engi
neering.
They landed at Tacoma. They will be
in different parts of this country from two
to three months before sailing for Europe.
All this and more was set forth yester
day to a Call representative who met the
gentlemen at the Occidental, by Mr. Yam- !
aguchi, their spoke-man.
"Yes, we have got to have elevated
roads in the big cities of Japan," he said ;
"there are too many people for us to gÂ£t
along without them. Japan is moving to
thÂ» front We intend to have better ele
vated railroads than any other country.
"Tokio, which will be the initial city
for the elevated system, is a great place
and may be la time the biggest city in the
world. It is 400 years old and has 2,000,
000 peopl' . It is growing right along, and
so situated that its growth must con
tinue.
"We want to visit Chicago, New York
and other cities where the elevated sys
tem is used, and see and understand for
ourselves the workings of these roads.
We have had the plans of them and all
the details by competent engineers made
out and forwarded to the department in
Japan for a good while. But the object of
the commission is to learn other details.
We want to study the practical workings
of tne roads.
"Tokio at present has only norse rail
ways for the accommodation of the people.
There is an electric system in but one
town â Kioto. We intend in the future to
use electricity and steam.
"The Government will also build in To
kio a great central station.
"Before this year Japan nÂ»ver bought a
ton 01 railroad iron in tbe United States.
This year already we have bought and
contracted to buy 40,000 tons of steel rails.
We have also bought a large number of
American locomotives.

SUICIDE OF W. A. HANNAFORD
Takes Hia Life With Gas, the Reason
Being Unknown.
William Hannaford, a dealer in laundry
supplies, committed suicide on Friday
night by inhaling gas in a room at 214
Third street. His dead body was not
found until 1 o'clock yesterday by Mr.
Hughes, the proprietor of the Hughes
House. Late Fric.ay evening Hannaford
went to th& lodging-house and hired a
cheap room, and nothing was known of
what was going on in the apartment until
the landlord detected the odor of gas and
burst open the door.
Hannaford was associated in business
with a man named Scott, and they made a
specialty of selling laundry supplies to
the Chinese. A few months ago their
store on Ninth street was destroyed by
fire, but that did not interfere much with
the business. It is said that on Friday
evening Hannaford lost a considerable
sum of money piaying cards.
Deceased was about 35 years of age and
was born io tnis State. At one time he
was president of Rincon Parlor. N. 8. G.
W. He leaves a brother and two sisters.
He was not married. Of late he iived at
1111 Bryant street. His Drother-in-law
said that he was unable to give a reason
for Hannaford's act.
