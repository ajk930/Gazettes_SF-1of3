Water Fills the Hold and the Cargo

aster Repeated
MONTEREY. <Jax., Aug. 9. -The Pacific
Coast Steamship St Paul lies on the rocks
just south of Point Pinos, full of water
and a total loss. The Pacific Mail Steam
ship Colombia lies on the rocks just south
of Pigeon Point, full of water and a total
loss. The two luckless vessels â sisters in
misfortune â are about fifty miles apart
The causes of their destruction are so
identical as to be remarkable. Both were
feeling their way to San Francisco; both
became bewildered in a dense fog, and
both went ashore.
The St Paul struck her fatal reef at ten
minutes past eleven o'clock last evening.
The deck was in charge of First Officer j
Andrew Hail, with Captain J. C. Downing |
on the bridge, personally directing the
movement; of the vessel. The night was j
dark and the thick fog made it impossible
to s ee ten feet ahead of the bow. The
steamer was running under a slow bell and
just before her stem touched the rocks the
heavy wnite veil ahead lifted a little and
the lookout on the bow saw the foam of a
breaker. He quickly gave the alarm and
the engine-room bell sounded to stop and
then back full speed, but betore the
doomed ship could be checked she ground
into the rocks, and several succeeding
swells lifted her higher up.
in the meantime the engines had been â 
reversed and the propeller was churning :
tne water astern into foam in its efforts to ;
free the vessel. â The attempt was useless I
and the St. Paul settled down on her bed, j
just as did the Colombia four weeks ago.
The sharp rocks pierced her bottom in '
several places and the water be^an to
come in to the amidships compartment, !
flooding the fire and engine rooms. No i
further attempt to get her off was made !
and the order was given by Captain Down
ing to clear away all the boats.
The shock of her striking and the quickly '
succeeding grinding and bumping awak- ]
ened ail the passengers, as well as tne ;
officers and crew in their bunks below.
There were sixteen women and four chil
dren on board, and among these there j
was at first considerable confusion. They
were, however, quickly given to under- '
stand that there was no danger, and they >
were soon dressed and ready to leave the
steamer.
As the boats were swung over the side j
into the sea and manned the passengers â¢
were taken aboard, the women first. There '
was no confusion nor any mishap, as the I
water was smooth aud only a light wind i
was blowing. Captain Downing directed
the officers in charge to make their way to !
Monterey, which port he believed was i
close by. Nothing could be seen nor heard i
and even the breakers close aboard were
at times hidden by the fog.
The rive boats put off in the darkness,
cautiously feeling their way. The nigtit
was cold and the passengers, especially j
the women, being lightly clad, were soon ;
chilled. The boat commanded by Second |
Officer Philip Ward made a landing near !
Pacific Grove, and seven of the passengers j
started overland for Monterey, reaching }
this place about 4 o'clock this morning
and bringing the first news of the wreck, i
Tbe other boats got into the harbor a few
hours later and all the passengers were
then safely domiciled at the Pacific Ocean
House.
Tbe St. Paul lies as she struck, heading
due east, within about 100 yards of the
shore, something like three miles south of
Point Pinos light. That three miles was
tbe extent of Captain Downing's error.
He was just that distance off his course
and away from the position in which he
should have been. Like Captain Clark,
who made tbe fatal mistake of believing
that the Colombia had rounded Pigeon
Point light, Downing headed his ship east
ward. Instead of steaming safely into
Monterey he piunged the St. Paul squarely
on the beach.
Tbe ccast all along this locality is a bed
of kelp whicb extends for miles out into
the sea. This indicates shallow water,
from one to four fathoms deep. Conse
quently the St. Paul, drawing twelve to
nueen feet of water, must have been piow
-ItÂ£ her way under a slow bell through
this bank of luxuriant marine vegetation
for hours. The question naturally arises,
If the captain, bis bearing gone in the
blinding foe, did not know that the
deadly reefs were at times only a few feet
below hU keel, why did be not use his I
lead?
Moreover, those waters are charted and
the shoals and currents plainly indicated.
About a mile west of Po-nt Pinos is a
whistling buoy, marking the outer verge
of a dangerous reef.' It sounds its warn
ing pipe unceasingly, and can often be
heard in Monterey, four miles away. The
officers stated yesterday that they could
not hear it from the locality of the vessel.
Through tbe dense fog no ray could come
from :he lighthouse.
The St. Paul was heavily laden, having
among her cargo 5000 sacks of grain be
side* a ereat quantity of butter and cheese.
There is also on board over 100 head of
calves, shipped by Captain W. F. Tayior
of San Simeon. They wiil be transferred
to another vessel to-morrow and for
warded to their destination.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
As there is six feet of water in the for
ward hold and a much greater depth aft
much of the cargo, especially the grain, is
undoubtedly a loss.
The vessel lies off Mess Beach, about
half way between a point known as Seal
Rocks and Point Pinos. Her bow is some
what elevated and the stern low in the
water, and, as she is tightly wedged in a
sort of cradle between two ledees of rock
she is steady, excepting for a slight swing
and roll when a sea rolis in against her.
There is a heavy fog coming in, but the
ocean is still and but little wind blowing.
Captain Minor Goodall came in from
the wreck late this evening, having ar
rived on the Santa Rosa. He believes
there is a possibility that the vessel can be
saved, but can not state positively until
an examination is made by divers to-
! "The rocks have pierced through the
iron plates of the hull about amidships,"
said he to a Call correspondent. "All of
the compartments are flooded with water.
The fire and cngine>*rooras are awash and
thÂ«t machinery is useless for any work.
All of the cargo, especially the wheat and
wool, in the holds is ruined, entailing a
heavy loss. The freight steamer Santa
Cruz will come down from San Francisco
in the morning and the livestock and
what can be recovered will be taken off.
â  Captain Downing thought he was round
| ing Point Pinos, and, changing his coarse
Ito the eastward, went on the iocks. The
i fog was co thick that nothing could, be
I seen, and neither breakers nor buoy could
; be neard. Consequently he was not aware
that he was near the shore until he felt
; his vessel strike. I was only aboard of the
St. Paul this evening a few minutes and
' cannot tell much of what occurred prior to
j the time she went ashore. If she can pos
j sibly be saved no effort will be spared to
j rescue her. If the sea remains smooth we
j can do much toward lightening our loss,
I even if we don't get her on the dry dock."
However bopefnl Captain Goodall is, the
rocks are sharp all around her and every
roll and fall on the reef starts a plate and
the St. Paul will probably keep the Colom
bia company on their hard rocky beds
until the seas batter them out of shape.
When the shipwrecked passengers were
seen sitting on the veranda of the hotel
this afternoon they were waiting patiently
for the train that was to carry them city
wards. Mrs. George Swain of Berkeley
was one of the ladies lowered into the last
boat. After being settled in the small
craft tossing alongside the bumping
steamer, she saw that her husband was
still on deck and resolutely crawled back
onto the deck.
"There was nothing of a heroic nature
j in my action," said she. "I simply thought
j if my husband could stay there I could
; keep him company."
Captain Taylor, one of the passengers
> who landed at Pacific Grove and footed it
I into town, states that his party soon after
! getting ashore knocked at tne door of
I Keeper Hitchcock, who has charge of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company's
I tract, known as the Seventeen Mile drive,
j and asked for assistance.
He was requested to send a messenger
to Monterey for help, Dut he refused and
was indignant that he should be aroused
from his bed at 3 o'clock in the morning
even to assist shipwrecked people. He re
sumed his slumbers and they trudged on
through the fog and darkness.
There is a belief among the passengers
that the light on Point Pinos was not
burning. Soon after the vessel struck
rockets were sent up, and they say that
until this time no gleum came from the
point. Then the light shone* out.
Captain Downing was the first officer of
the St. Paul when she was purchased by
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company, and
he was promoted to her command last
month. He has the reputation of being a
carefui. zealous and faithful officer, and
being so well acquainted with these waters
one would wonder at him running ashore,
and why his ship out yonder, within a bis
cuit's throw of the beach, is grinding off
her plates to-night.
According to the accounts of some of the
passengers and several of the crew, there
was considerable confusion just after the
vessel struck. Men and women for a few
moments rushed out of their rooms half
dressed around the boats. Some of the
employes of the ship lost their heads, put
on life preservers and crowded around the
boats. They were forced by the officers to
take off the belts and go below by threats
of summary punishment. It is also said
that the colored lights of Point Sur wen

seen and thought to be the red and green
lights on the wharf at Monterey.
Oat of all these vague and naif whis
pered reports it it apparent that "some
body blundered."
George Norton, one of the crew, is in
clined to speak of the disaster. He was
on the Colima when she went down on
the Mexican coast and is no novice in
shipwrecks.
"We were going at the rate of eleven
knots an hour," he said, "when we struck.
We hit hard. The engines were reversed
and we backed nearly fifty feet, then
stayed there. I was in my room at the
time and one of the rocks is now in the
middle of it.
"The shock threw me out of my bunk
and the place began filling with water,
and I immediately went on deck and
found women running about in their
nightclothes. They were all panic
stricken, and although I told them there
was no immediate danger they would not
return to their cabins to dress.
One woman I actually carried to
her stateroom and locked her in
until she dressed. The saloon was
flooded quickly and the cattle in the bold
scented the danger and began bellowing.
This made the scene all the more appall
ing. Then a boat was let down to find
out about the shore line, and where to
land the passengers. I was in this boat,
and after rowing around for quite a dis
tance we found Moss Beach. We could
not see the light at Point Pinos, and I do
not think it was burning at all. Neither
could we hear the Point Pinos bellbuoy."
"After finding a place suitable to land I
our passengers we repaired again ,to our
boat. The first boat to leave the ship con
tained nineteen persons, mostly women
and children. The next boat had twenty
three people. The last boat carried the
steward and one man. Tnev were all
safely landed at 3a. ji. The crew all went
back, and we were so exhausted we could
hardly do anything."
Michael Noon, the wharfinger at Mon
terey, was seen and. he saia: "I was on
board the St. Paul twice to-day. She is i
awful solid on the rocks. I think when '
CROWDS VIEWED T.HE WRECKED ST. PAUL
they clear her cargo they can raise her, but
I don't think she will ever float. There is
ten feet of water in her hold now and she
has three rocks jammed into her, one for
ward and two aft."
Captain Ooodall ordered the crew ashore
to-night and they are now camped on the
beach.
The officers of the St. Paul were: Cap
tain J. C. Downing; Chief Officer, Andrew

The St. Paul is an iron steamship, built
at Philadelphia in 1875 for the Alaska
Commercial Company. She is of 960 tons
burthen, 197 feet long, and her breadth of
beam v 31 feet. Martin Bulger of this
City superintended her construction.
After her arrival on this coast she was put
in the trade between San Francisco and
the Alaskan ports. She made one or two
trips to Panama loaded with furs, which
were forwarded by the Alaska Commer
cial Company via the isthmus to London,
and she was several timed chartered by
the Pacific Mail Company to run on their
line to Panama and Central American
ports. In 1879, when General Grant vis
ited San Francisco on his way home from
his journey around the world, the St.
Paul was placed at his disposal for a jour
ney to Portland, Or. She was fitted up
especially for the occasion, and, accom
panied by Senator John F. Miller, who
r-as president of the Alaska Company, the
general and Mrs. Grant, together with
Colonel Fred and Ulysses Grant Jr., made
the voyaÂ«e in a very en joy abie manner.
At the expiration of the fur seal privi
leges granted to the Alaska Company the
St. Paul went out of commission and was
laid up in Oakland Creek. On the organi
zation of the North American Navigation
Company the St. Paul was chartered and
made the pioneer voyage between this
port and Panama. On the collapse of that
organization the vessel was purchased by
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company, ajid
after bein: overhauled and refitted, a pro
cess which detracted greatly from her ap
perance to the nautical eye.she was placed
in service between San Francisco and Re
dondo, touching at way ports.
Captain Downing, the commander of the
St. Paul, is a resident of Oakland and has
been engaged in service on this coast for a
number of years. He was formerly first
officer of the Willamette Valley and was
promoted to the command of the Bonita.
From the latter vessel be was transferred
to the St. Paul, a much larger and finer
vessel.
Captain Freeman, the well-known pilot,
returned from the scene of the wreck last
evening. He reported, that the St. Faul
was lying easily and apparently making
no water. He gave it as bis opinion that
if the cargo is lightered they will be able
to get the vessel off.
F. S. LANNING STORY.
He Tells of Bis Experience on the 111
--â }. ' Â Sated ,' Steamer. :. ..; .
F. S. Lanning of North Ontario, agent
of the Southern California Railway, who
was a passenger on the St Paul, arrived in
this City last evening and registered at the
Commercial Hotel.
"It had been a little rough Saturday
afternoon and the sea was just rough
enough to make people seasick,'' said Mr.
Lanning, and it continued until 8 o'clock
io tbe evening, when, feeling tired, I re
tired, and it was not long before I was
sound asleep. Suddenly I was awasened
by a severe bump, then another and still
another, abd then I was thrown
out of my berth, as was also
a young man who occupied the berth
below me. 'Guess we've got into Mon
terey and the steamer's run into tbe
wharf,' he remarked as he straightened
up. 1 replied that I thought it was worse
than that, and believed that the steamer
had been climbing on a lot of rocks. \ve
got out on tbe deac and saw that the
vessel was enveloped in a heavy fog and
it was impossible to tell where we were, as
there was no light from shore that was
visible.
The steamer thumped several times and
then settled, careening so much to port
that a man could not walk the deck with
out being very careful.
The other passengers came on deck and
there was considerable excitement, but
very little confusion. Tbe women, witb
the exception of two or three who fainted,
behaved remnrfcably well. The master of
the vessel and the other officers acted with
great coolness and did all they could to
quiet tbe passengers, and gave orders to
secure life-preservers and put them on.
There were plenty of these, and soon
everyone had one or two on his or her
body. In the meantime we could hear
tbe breakers rolling on the shore and
could hear the water rushing into the
bold of tne steamer.
"The master as soon as possible gave
orders to lower the boats, five in number,
and this was done as rapidly as the
hands â who seemed somewhat rattled â
could do so, and as many passengers as
could be placed in each were taken in.
Each officer in charge of a boat was given
orders to make for the nearest point at
which a landing could be effected and re
turn with all possible haste. That was no
easy tasK, for the fog was so thick that it
was impossible to see a boat's length

BAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 9.â James E.
Ga r ratt and three companions were caught
in the act of unearthing the famous En
senada gold bar valued at 112.000, which
was stolen from the office of M. Riveroll
at Ensenada on the night of March 30,
1895. The captors ot the party were Mexi
cans, headed by no less a personage than
Governor Agustin Sangines himself. The
Garratt party was just about to dig for tbe
gold when Governor Sangines ordered
them to be surrounded and overpowered.
The Mexicans qnickly carried out the or
der, forcing Garratt and the others to
hold up their bands and look down the
muzzles of four rifles. Then Governor
Sangines demanded from Garratt the exact
location of the bar which the wretched fel
low gave and a few moments' shoveling
revealed the bar. The Governor took pos
session of it and ordered the four prisoners
jailed.
Garratt spent sixteen months in the
Ensenada jail under suspicion of having
been the robber, bat it could not be proved
against him and he was released on July
25. Allan Pratt, bookkeeper for Mr. Riv
eroll, was arrested at the same time and
released with Garratt. Pratt and Garratt
were good friends and Pratt had access to
tbe sate where the bar was kept, but be
yond this there was nothing to indicate
that they were guilty, and nobody in this
city would believe they were the thieves.
Garratt is a native of Montreal and Pratt
is an Englishman. Both lived at Ensenada
some years and became Mexican citizens,
which worked much to their disadvantage
when they were in prison.
As soon as Garratt was released he came
to this city, arriving July 26. The next
day he took out citizenship papers and
said Jfexico would never see him again.
He hung round town awhile and disap
peared some time last week.
It was learned to-day that he hired the
junk Pekin, Captain Frank R, Colbert, to
convey him and two passengers to Sauzal,
a little landing place eight miles north of
Enseneda. The two men with Garratt
came down on the schooner Dawn from
San Pedro ten days ago, and no one here
knows their names. They are supposed to
be the men captured with Garratt. The
fourth man caught was Sam Hay ward, a
worthless character at Ensenada.
The captain and crew of the junk were
not caught, and they are supposed to be
on tbeir way hither. The junk was sighted
off Sauzal Friday evening from the
steamer Pacheco, which was on her way to
this city.
The gold-bar robbery was an interesting
affair. Tbe bar was owned by the Ibarra
Mining Company of San Francisco.
The company's mines are at Calamalli,
about 300 miles south of San Diego. Tbe
gold was brought to Ensenada on a schoo
ner and deposited in Riveroli's shipping
office for safe keeping. It was there a day
or two. On the night of March 20, a year
ago, it was stolen, the safe being opened
by means of the combination.
It was this fact which cast suspicion
upon Pratt Riveroll himself, however,
was not free from suspicion, and after
Pratt had been arrested Riveroll was
placed behind the bars, but not held long.
Riveroll gave up $13,000 worth of property
to indemnify the Ibarra Company, but
since then has paid $3000 in cash toward
tbe loss, retaining the chance to redeem
bis property.
When Pratt was released two weeks ago
he stayed at Ensenada a day or two, where
his family remains.
Then he came to San Diego and said he
had an offer of a good position witb D.
Duncan, who is or was secretary of a loan
and trust company at San Francisco.
Pratt proceeded to San Francisco, and is
believed to be there now.
It was learned to-day that strenuous
efforts will be made to extradite him, as
tbe treaty between this country and Mex
ico provides ior the exchange of prisoners
held on charges involving more th&n
$10,000.
Pratt, even if it becomes known that he
was implicated in the robbery, is not con
sidered the leader. Garratt is undoubt
edly tbe ringleader, and many here be
lieve he went to Ensenada determined to
get tbe bar and get away with it leaving
Pratt with nothing but the memory of
sixteen months in prison for his pains.
The punishment awaiting Garratt is
severe. If be is not sent to tbe salt mines
in tbe Gulf of California, where a number
of prisoners are kept, to work in the awful
heat, he may be ordered to Belem prison
in Mexico, where several thousand prison
ers are always confined. The penalty for
burglary is about the same as in the United
States, but the difference in treatment is
to be considered. In Mexico tbe prisoner
is allowed only 20 cents (Mexican money)
per day for food, and no b d ing.
Garratl is small and frail and will not
live long under such conditioas. He has
wealthy relatives in Montreal and Eng
land, but their combined efforts were
fruitless to get him out of jail or secure
him any concessions during his first imÂ»2
prisonment, except that he got better food
by paying for it.
SANTO TOM AS' MOWGLI.
Remarkable Daring of a Young Indian,
Who Slays Mountain Lions
With a Knife.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 9.â A veritable
Mowgli has been found in Lower Califor
nia. There is no jungle at Santo Tomas,
and it is rather a picturesque valley, ex
tending back from the sea. The moun
tains are hiuh on either side, and scrubby
oaks and thickets along the creek furnish
cover for mountain lions and wildcats,
which come down from the hills into the
valley. The lion is no: supposed to be
particular about his diet, but if there is
one thing more than another that he finds
appetizing it is a young burro. And then
there are many goats in the valiey , and
thus he is supplied with variety.
There is a powerful young Indian buck
named Xaftus, not more than 20 years
old, who lives at Santo Tomas, and who is
known throughout that section as the
"Lion Killer." His prowess makes nim
worthy of wider reputation. Xaftus' only
weapon in the chase is a long knife, and
he is the possessor of a pack of dogsâ big
wolfish fellows.
During the past season he has killed a
half dozen lions, some of them enormous
beasts.
Some days afro Xaftus, with his long
knife and (Jogs, came across a large lion
among some huge bowlders by the creek.
The dogs surrounded the animal, and one,
chancing to get too close, was caught by a
blow from a big paw, and disemboweled.
Then the pack fell back and set up a howl,
but Xaftus, tearing his game would escape,
rushed forward encouraging his does, and
caught the creature by the tail. He was
about to reach him with the knife when
with a tremendous spring the lion cleared
the bowlder.
Little less active than the lion, the
young buck scaled the rock and met bis
cowardly enemy face to face as it crouched
on the other side.
The animal was not disposed to fight,
and with a few more leaps he perched
himself on one of the limbs of a big oak
near by. while the dogs howled beneath.
Now Xaftus was right at home. Secur
ing a pole he lashed hi'j knife to one end,
and thus provided with a lance he took a
position directly under the lion and pro
ceeded to use it. A few successful jabs
and it fell an easy victim to the dogs.
Ttiis lion measured over seven feet in
length.
The young Indian Hercules eoes almost
naked and is not known to live with his
tribe. He spends his time entirely in
hunting.
JUAN OSANA DEAD.
WÂ»iÂ» the Oldest Member of the Native
Sons Order.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 9.â Juan
Osuna, the oldest member of the order of
Native Sons of the Golden West, died to
night at 8:30 o'clock, surrounded by a
numerous family. He was born at the old
uiission of San Diego in 1824, and lived here
most of his life. For several years he had
been a resident cf Tia Juana. He suffered
for the past two weeks with heart
trouble, which caused his death.
' Osuna joined the Native Sons of the
Goidei. West here some years ago, and
was proud of his distinction as the oldest
member of the order. He took a prom
inent pait in several celebrations on that
account, and gave valuable historical data
to the historian of the order. The Native
Sons will take charge of his funeral,
which wiil take place on Tuesday.
WAR ON THE COLUMBIA,
Fisherman Enraged hy a Reduc
tion of the Price for Their
Catch.
Men Assaulted Eecause They Accept
the Figures Off-red at the
Canneries.
ASTORIA, Ob., Aug. 9.â Trouble has
been brewing between the fishermen and
canneries for several days past, growing
out of the notices published at some of the
canneries that they would pay only 3 cents
a pound for salmon. Last night 150 fisher
men gathered at the dock of the Columbia
Cannery (Seaborg's) and refused to allow
the fishermen who had brougnt fish from
Ilwaco traps to land them, since the gill
netters catch was refused at the 3-cent
price.
The men claimed that the canneries
waited until they had all gone out the
night before and then posted the reduc
tion notice, and that had they been pre
viously notified they would not have
hshed."
The Sheriff had been notified to quell
the disturbance, but in his absence a dep
uty responded to the call, and after arriv
ing at the scene sent for the captain of
police to come to his assistance. No acts
of violence had been committed by the
fishermen, though but few fish were
landed.
The feeling is intense at some of the
canneries, and it is reported that several
acts of violence have been committed.
Early this morning a fisherman, Gus
Snugg, attacked Jacob Jackson, one of
Elmore's men, under the dock of Elinore's
cannery. He pummeled Jackson badly,
and then got into another difficulty at the
Cutting Packing Company's cannery near
by by intimidating other fisherman who
had been disposing of their catches for 3
cent 3 and less rather than throw them
overboard.
Warrants were sworn out this afternoon
for Gus Snugg, Con Anderson, Alex Peter
son and a number of others. When the
officers attempted to arrest Snueg, Jack
son was standing by and another attack
was made on him by a half dozen men led
by Snugsr. Jackson drew a revolver and
snapped it, but it failed to go off. He was
badly bruised and ran for the cannery
followed by Snugg, but the door was
closed and he escaped further damage.
Snugg was finally taken into custody,
while the crowd was loud in denuncia
tions.

BERLIN, Germany, Aug. 9.â A select
conference was held on Thursday evening,
at the residence of Professor Sering of the
Berlin Academy of Agriculture, to which
were invited Baron yon Hammerstein-
Loxten, Prussian Minister of Agriculture,
Domains and Forests; Dr. Thiel, First
Councilor of the Ministry of Agriculture;
Hon. Edwin F. Uhl, United States Em
bassador to Germany ; Dr. Schumacher,
who has made two official visits to the
United States for the purpose of studying
tne agricultural conditions prevailing in
America; Mr. Turke of the agricultural
manufacturing firms; David Lubin of Sac
ramento, Cal., as the representative of the
Patrons of Husbandry, and two or three
other prominent agrarians. Baron yon
Hammerstein-Loxten and Embassador
Uhl, having made prior engagements,
were compelled to absent themselves from
the conference, but all :he others who
were invited were present.
Mr. Lubin presented a number of ques
tions for discussion bearing upon the pros
pective causes and effects and remedies
connected with the decline of prices in the
agricultural products of the world. Among
the number of remedies suggested by the
questions submitted were the remonetiza
tion of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 and the
establishment of a free-trade system. The
submission of the questions was followed
by a discussion which lasted five hours.
Professor Sering delivered an address in
which he expressed bis belief that the
prices of agricultural products had reached
their lowest figures, but he admitted that
while they would not fall any lower it was
possible that they might remain stationary
for a long time to come.
Alluding to Mr. Lubin's contention,
which was that if the effort to establish a
free-trade system should fail the farmers
of the United States ought to be granted
bounties on their exports by the Govern
ment, Professor Sering said he was not
surprised at Mr. Lubin's demand, but he
warned him and the others of his hearers
that if such a system of bounties were
established it would immediately elicit
strong retaliatory measures in Europe,
and perhaps cause the creation of a pro
tectionist union of the European coun
tries against the United States. It was a
mere delusion, he continued, for the agri
culturists of the United States to sup
pose that France and Germany could be
starved into surrendering. The Argentine
Republic and Russia, he said, could pro
vide au ample supply of wheat, meats,
etc., for an indefinite time.
Dr. Schumacher, who followed Profes
sor Sering, concurred in that gentleman's
opinions, and contended that the coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 in the
United States would necessarily induce a
very serious economic conflict with
Europe.
Mr. Turke, whose commercial connec
tions are chiefly with the Argentine Re
public and Russia, expressed himself as
convinced that both of tnose countries
were only beginning their careers as the
grain providers of the world. Russia, he
said, was developing in the production of
grain amazingly, and he predicted that
within a few years the whole of Southern
Siberia would become a serious competitor
for supplying Europe and the rest of the
world withâ¬erealÃ.
Professor Sering suggested the creation
of an international alliance of the agrarians
of the world, with a central bureau in
London, Washington, Berlin or Paris, and
that the alliance hold an annual meeting
of delegates from the various agrarian in
stitutions. The proposal was deferred for
the action of a future conference.
Baron yen Hammerstein-Loxten had pre
viously received Mr. Lubin, who was in
troduced to the Minister of Agriculture by
Embassador Uhl. Upon this occasion
Baron yon Hammerstein declared that he
was in full sympathy with Mr. Lubin in
the latter's anxiety in regard to thÂ« decline
in the prices of agricultural products.
Prussia, he said, was suffering equally
with the rest of the world from depression
of business and prices. He added that he
was glad that Mr. Lubin was about to dis
cuss the problem with which they were
confronted with the leading economists of
Germany. Baron yon Hammerstein later
introduced Mr. Lubin to Professor Sering
and Dr. Schumacher. A report of the
proceedings of the agricultural conference
has been furnished to Baron yon Hammer
stein.
The inhabitants of the Lower Rhine dis
tricts had long been in expectation that
the Emperor would make a tour of their
section of the empire in accordance with
his announced programme, and had made
elaborate preparations to receive^ his
Majesty with all possible honors. It was
expected that the Kaiser would be present
at the dedication of the restored church at
Wesel and unveil the statue of his grand
father, Emperor William I, at Run.ort on
Friday, and these places were the centers
of attraction to all who could possibly
make the journey. When it was an
nounced that the Emperor could not pos
sibly be present, owing to illness, the peo
ple were greatly disappointed, but the
programme previously arranged was car
ried out to the letter and the exercises at
tracted crowds of people. The Empress
and Prince Henry of Prussia, who repre
sented the Emperor, his brother, were re
ceived with every manifestation of enthu
siasm.
Although an attack of catarrh was eiyen
as the reason for the Emperor abandoning
his proposed trip to the lower Rhine, there
is no doubt that political affairs were the
chief cause of his remaining behind, but
the story now in circulation, that a crisis
in the Chancellorship is impending is a
mere resurgence of a favorite theme of
late when current politics become a little
dull. The North German Gazette, in its
issue of yesterday, made the announce
ment that the Czar had notified the Em
peror that he and the Czarina Would visit
Breslau about the sth of September, upon
the occasion of the Silesian military
maneuvers. The proximity of this event
alone discounts the idea that Prince
Hohenlohe will resien within the next few
weeks, if, indeed, "he does so for many
months to come.
Ths usual stock of stories are in circu
lation in connection with the Emperor's
recent tour of the northern seas, chief
among them being an account of his

Majesty's democratic demeanor. It is re
lated that he completely discarded his ac
customed court stiffness and made him
self particularly agreeable to high and low
alike. One of the Emperor's guests on
this trip tells this story:
"The Kaiser on becoming aware that
some of the officers of the Hohenzollern
were in the habit of riding bicycles upon
the promenade deck of the imperial yacht,
went personally to the officers and asked
them why they had not invited him to
take part in their sport. The officers, with
a great deal of trepidation, admitted that
they had ridden their bicycles in disobe
dience of the orders of Captain Brussata,
the commander of the Hoheuzollern,
whereupon the Kai9er summoned Captain
Brussata and compelled him to mount a
bicycle, his Majesty holding the machine
steady while the unhappy captain and the
group surrounding him were photo
graphed, amid the ill-concealed titters of
the officers."
A Vienna sign-painter named Moritz
Bach recently arrived in Berlin and ob
tained work at his trade. He complied
with ail the requirements of the law re
lating to newcomers, informing the police
of his birthplace, occupation, etc., but
was roughly given to understand by the
police that he was not wanted in Berlin;
that there were already too many work
men in Prussia, and that be ought to have
remained in Austria. He failed to heed
the warnine given to him by the police,
and the latter in the meantime communi
cated with the police in Vienna, endeavor
ing to find some excuse for driving him
out of Germany. Among the inquiries
made was whether Bach had ever been
convicted of any offense in Austria. The
Vienna police loosed up Bach's record
and found that he had been convicted of
the heinous offense of calling his employer
an "exploiter," for which he was com
pelled to pay a fine. The police, upon re
ceiving this information, ordered Bach to
leave Prussia within ten days.
The Vorwaerts, the leading organ of
the Socialists, in an article commenting
upon Bach's case, expresses the opinion
that his is a test case upon which it is de
signed to base wholesale expulsions of
foreign workmen from Prussia.
The International Psychological Con
gress at Munich has been well attended.
Professor Baldwin of Princeton College
was among the speakers and in his ad
dress dwelt upon the importance of the
German universities to American students.
Tlje congress invited Prince Ludwig of
Bavaria and other royalties to witness a
new experiment with the Roenteen rays
upon the body of a man. The body was
submitted to the action of the rays
through an apparatus of special design
which enabled the spectators to clearly
observe ti e action of the diaphragm, heart
and stomach. The experiment was en
tirely successful.
In connection with the recent pooling
of the petroleum business of the Hamburg
firm of John & Co. with thatof Philip Pots
of Mannheim and the Passows of Bremen,
the Hamburger Boersenhalle now makes
the announcement that all of the dealings
of the members of the pool or "ring" have
been transacted with the Standard Oil
Company since May 24, and that the uni
fication of the petroleum trade of the
world is an accomplished fact.
The socialist Vorwaerta stigmatizes
Henry George's action in entering the
Presidential campaign in the United States
as an advocate of Bryan as probably the
last phase of his downward career. The
paper adds tbp.t Mr. George's action will
probably have very little political effect,
his few remaining followers having long
ago joined the ranks of the Populists.
Hon. Wayne MacVeagb, United States
Embassador to Italy, is in Berlin, en route
from St. Petersburg for Rome.
in connection with the policy of German
colonial expansion it is worthy of notice
that the Prussian rescript of 1859 forbid
ding the promotion of emigration to the
three southern provinces of Brazil has
just been withdrawn. It is expected that
the German settlements founded in those
provinces prior to 1859 will now be devel
oped and extended. Arrangements have
been made for a special steamship service
between Hamburg and Brazil.
The German fleet is assembled at Wil
helmshaven to-day and the naval man
euvers will begin to-morrow, August 10,
with the inspection of the vessels. After
the inspection the ships will be put
through various tactics in the North Sea
until August 14. when the fleet will pass
through the North Sea-Baltic canal with
the object of testing tue strategic value of
that waterway. It is expected that fifty
four vessels, besides the torpedo boats and
transports, will traverse the canai. After
the passage of the canal the fleet will go
to Lubeck and the Neufahrwasser and re
turn to Kiel on August 29, remaining there
four days. The idea of returning through
the North Sea-Baltic canal seems to have
been abandoned. The route most likely
to be taken by the fleet will be by the way
of the Skagerrack to Helgoland, where
the sham naval battles will take place.
The fleet will disband at the mouth of the
Elbe on September 15.
DIRE TROLLEY DISASTER,

Five Persons Are Killed Outright and
Forty Injured, Many of Them
Seriously.
COLUMBIA, Pa., Aug. 9.â A frightful
trolley accident occurred at 10 o'clock this
evening on the Columbia and Donegal
Electric Railway at a point one mile out
side of this city. A crowded car was re
turning from Chickies Park when a gear
wheel broke and the car was thrown over
a twenty-foot embankment, falling into a
creek.
Five passengers were killed outright
and two score injured, many of them very
seriously. Following is the list of fatali
ties so far as obtainable:
Killed : Chief Burgess H. H. Heiges of
Columbia.
Adam Foeblinger, motorman, Columbia.
James Ludlow, Seagirt, N. J.
Henry Smith, Columbia.
William Tinkerson, Columbia.
Twenty-nine injured passengers, many
of whom are expected to die, were brought
to Columbia Hospital. A full list is not
obtainable to-night. Among the injured
are:
B. Kerner and wife of Lancaster.
Lizzie Bender and George Bender, Lan

Miss Brinkman, Lancaster.
Physicans have gone from Lancaster to
aid tne wounded.
NEARLY A MILE A MINUTE.
Bicyclist Anderson's Hair-Raising Ride,
Paced by a Locomotiveâ He Will
Try It Again.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., August 9.â E. E. An
derson attempted to-day to ride one mile
in one minute, paced by a locomotive, and
failed by three seconds.
The trial was on the track of the Bluff
Line Railway, nine miles north of East
St. Louis. The track was solidly planked
and the engine was an express speeder.
Several warming-up spurts were made
over part of the track to get the speed
regulated.
In one of these Anderson made a half
mile in thirty-three seconds. For the
final trial a half-mile running start was
made. As the engine crossed the starting
line the cycler was seen twelve feet be
hind the engine and seeming to urge the
pacemaker, which was going at a fifty
eight-second speed.
At the half the speed was about a mile a
minute, with Anderson working hard and
fifteen feet behind. At the three-quarters
the engine was turned loose and crossed
the line in one minute, with Anderson
trailing and three seconds short.
HEAT AND DEATH
HAND IN HAND,
Appalling Mortality in the
States East of the
Rockies.
NO SECTION IS EXEMPT.
Prostrations So Numerous That
They Attract but Slight
Attention.
NOTHING LIKE IT ON EECORD.
Horses Drop Dead in the Streets, and
Foundries and Factories
Shut Down.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 9.â ln Chicago to
day the heat, waile not as intenso as
yesterday, was almost unbearable. There
was a respite in the morning, but it was
only temporary. A dull copperish sun
early sent thousands to the parks and on
excursions on Lake Michigan and to re
sorts across the lake. About 9 o'clock a
good breeze sprang up from the east, and
the temperature fell rapidly. This con
dition obtained until 11 o'clock, when the
minimum temperature of the day 76, was
reached. The cooling zephyrs suddenly
died out about this hour, and the sun, un
obscured by any clouds, soon increased
the torridity, until at 4 o'clock thermome
ters registered 96. The fall from this time
was about one degree per hour, and at 10
o'clock the mercury was stationary at 90.
But bne fatality was reported to-day-
John Suits, a day laborer, who was found
dead in his room on Fulton street. He is
supposed to have succumbed to the in
tense heat of last night. The fact that to
day was Sunday was no doubt responsible
for the small number of prostrations re
ported. The weather man promises no
relief for at least twenty-four hours.
Dispatches received from various points
throughout the country show that no
point is exempt from the torrid weather.
At Elgin, 111., yesterday a son of Mrs.
Loretta Mott died of prostration. Gerald
McChesney died from sunstroke, and Mrs.
J. J. Hartman was stricken down and will
die.
For three days the mercury has soared
above 100 at Evansville, Ind., and two
deaths have resulted. At Kansas City 102
was reached, the highest point since the
bureau was opened, eight years ago. The
place of observation is the breeziest point
in the city. On the streets it was many
degrees warmer. Despite the intense heat
few prostrations were reported. At An
derson, Ind., there was intense suffering
among the men in the nail factories.
There were three prostrations in the city.
Dispatches fiom Alton, Hillsboro,
Springfield and Belvedere, 111., indicate
the hottest weather on record. Outdoor
worn has been suspended at all these
points.
Vegetation is being burned by the heat,
and in many localities a water famine is
threatened. The Wabash Railway officials
have closed the shops for tne entire sys
tem pending the heated term. At Alton
the mercury ranged from 105 to 112 in the
shade. Milan, Mo., reported 106 in the
shade and much mortality among ani
mals. Horses dropped dead in the streets,
and only absolutely necessary work was
done. All records were broken at Jeffer
son, lowa, when the thermometer indi
cated 106 in the shade at 2 o'clock. At Tif
fin, Ohio, Henry Downey, an aged
and wealthy farmer, was overcome
by the heat. At Peoria, Illi
nois, Charles Sockman, a fisherman, and
Forest Hoffman, a laborer, were pros
trated. At Valparaiso, Ind., there were
half a dozen persons stricken down. At
Dcs Moines, lowa, a record of 92 in the
shade was reached and two fatalities were
reported, At Milwaukee, Rudolph Salo
mon, treasurer of the Ernest Salomon
Commission Company, was struck by a
bolt of lightning and instantly killed.
The thunder-shower in which Salomon
lost his life came in the middle of one of
the hottest days of the year. At Spring
field, 111., the day was the hottest of the
year, the maximum temperature being 98
deg., while street thermometers regis
tored 102.
ST. LOUIS' GREAT MORTALITY.
No Diminution in the Number of Deaths
and Prostrations.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 9.â To-day's heat
record was a repetition of that of yester
day, tempered by a light breeze. The
thermometer ranged from 81 degrees at 8
a. m, to 100 degrees at 5 r. m., and the death
roll is not diminished. All day the city
ambulances were busy carrying patients
to the dispensary and corpses to the
morgue. Many of those stricken several
days ago have succumbed to the long con
tinued strain of torrid days and sleepless
nights. Deaths from this cause are now
so common as to hardly excite remark. At
5 p. m. one ambulance hauled five persona
to the dispensary, and completed its jour
ney by taking two corpses from the dis
pensary.
Since midnight last night the following
deaths are recorded: Miss Pauline Tucker,
Frank Stelle, Thomas McGovern, Edward
Welee. Catherine Henry, Henry Albers,
Joseph Bly, Rudolph Roettger, Charles
Steinman," Margaret Albro, Edward
Wnnch, Barbara Maicomb, Frank Miller.
Up to 9 p m. over forty cases of prostra
tions had been reported, the majority of
them being serious.

OMAHA, Nebe., Aug. 9.â While : the
Government thermometer gives 94 as the
, maximum temperature to-day , the weather
seemed much warmer, and as it was but a
continuance of a week of extreme heat the
suffering was great. No fatalities have
been reported here, but there were many
prostrations, some of which may result
seriously. The amount of moisture in the
air has made the hot spell this year more
severe than warmer weather in the recent
dry years. A severe electric and rain
storm to-night has cooled the air and
given much relief.
DETR UIT CAS UAL TIES.
Terrific Wind and Rain Storm in the
Wnke of the Heat.
DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 9.â A terrific
rainstorm broke over this city to-night
after a day of intense heat. The storm
was accompanied by a high wind which
broke over the river and Lake St. Clair,
upsetting a dozen yachts which were on
the river at the time. There were a num
ber of daring rescues. Three persons are
so far known to have been drowned. Wil
liam J. Thiemer was batuing off a yacht
at B lie Isle Park and was swamped and
drowned. Frank Hughes, bathing off the
yacht Alberta, met a similar fate. John
Helka Jr., who was bathine off Peche Isl
and, in Lake St. Clair, was also drowned.
There are reports to-night that several
persons are missing who were known to
have been on the river or lake.
Edward Henkel, aged 43, son and suc
cessor of Peter Henkel, proprietor of the
largest and oldest wholesale grocery and
liquor-house in Detroit, was killed at Port
Huron to-day on his yacht Azalea. He
was trying to get out "of the way of a big
lake liner and was heading his yacht off
the dock when he was caught between the
yacht and the timbers and fatally crushed.
This was the hottest day of the season"
for Detroit. The thermometer|stood at 95
for several hours. No prostrations were
reported, however.
SUFFERING NEW YORKERS.
Jliousands of People Flock to the Aen
mhore Resorts.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 9. -The suf
ferings of New Yorkers to-day are intense.
Profiting by the general cessation from
labor and business cares which Sunday
brings and by the warnings issued from
the experts of the Weatner Bureau, thou
sands of people flocked to the shore re
sorts. Although the mercury at its high
est point to-day did not reach by two de
grees the top mark of Saturday, this de
crease in temperature was more than dis
counted by an increase in the humidity.
About 4 p. m. the thermometer of the
Weather Bureau touched 90 deg. as the
highest point of the day. The official
figures are necessarily lower than those
shown by the thermometers on the pave
ments, where the highest point touched
was 95. A large number of persons were
overcome by the heat during the day, and
up to 6 o'clock this evening twelve fatali
ties had been reported to the Coroner's
office. The heat was also intense in
Brooklyn, and nine fatalities were re
ported in that city.
AN ELECTRICAL STORM.

Lincoln, Xebr.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Aug. 9.â The intense
heat of the past week was in a measure dis
sipated by an electrical storm last night,
followed by another to-night, accompanied
by heavy rain and wind. Friday was the
hottest day of the year, the Government
station reporting the maximum tempera
ture at 98. There have been no prostra
tions, but business Friday and Saturday
was partially suspended.
COUNCIL BLUFFS SCORCHED.
Week of Extreme Heat Followed by a
Refreshing Rainstorm.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, Aug. 9.â The
heat here has been extreme for the past
week, the thermometer registerinjr from
98 to 100 degrees in the shade. There has
been but one fatality. The heated spell
was broken this evening by a heavy rain
storm, accompanied by thunder and light
ning. Tnese storms have occurred fre
quently during the week and one death
has occurred from lightning.
FIFTEEN DEATHS AT BALTIMORE.
And Double That Number of Prostra-
tiontt Up to Midnight.
BALTIMORE, Mb., August 9.â The
heat record was about the same to-day as
during the past four. The maximum was
not reached until 4:30 this evening, when
,97.4 was recorded. The mercury was
above the 90 point before 8 o'clock, and
did not descend below that point until
after 9 o'clock to-night. Fifteen deaths
and twice that many prostrations were re
ported up to midnight.
PHILADELPHIA'S VICTIMS.
Twenty' One Deaths and Fifty Cases of
Prostration.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. U.-With
each day's continuance of the terrible
heat the mortality has increased until
to-day twenty-one deaths were reported
by the police. The thermometers reached
a maximum of 93.2 degrees, the highest
point reached this summer. Besides the
deaths there were half a hundred heat
cases taken to the hospital.

ahead; but the boats went off, trusting
that tne fog would lift, but it did not until
late the next morning.
"There were ten others besides myself
who decided to remain by the ship rather
than endanger the lives of the other pas
sengers by overloading the boats. Nearly
all the passengers who went into the boats
were got into them with little trouble and
none of the ship's employes got into them
unless by order of the master, with the
exception of t\vo cooks, who could not be
restrained.
''There were many head of cattle on
board and it was pitiful to hear their
moaning. After the boats went we could
do nothing but wait, and it seemed a long
time until the first boat, which was the
first mate's, hove in sight at 6
o'clock. In the meantime the master had
all the life rafts ready, so as to use them in
case of necessity. The sea calmed down
and when the tide receded I saw that
the vessel was on a cradle of rocks in five
or six feet of water, about 500 feet from
shore, with her bow due east.
"At one time I volunteered to swim
ashore, but was advised not to, and I am
glad I did not make the attempt, for if I
had I would have been dashed to pieces
on the rocks. One young man, S. B. Can
nell, parted from his wife and told her to
go in one of the boats and that he would
remain on the steamer. She begged him
to come with her, but he tola her that he
wanted her to reach land and that if he
got into the boat it would sink. He re
mained with me until we were taken off.
When we did get ashore we learned of the
safe arrival of the boats and ascertained
that we struck about eight miles below
Monterey."
The Santa Cruz, a freight boat, went to
the wreck at 2 o'clock yesterday, but car
ried no passengers, having no license to
do so. The boat will render whatever aid
she can to the stranded vessel. The prin
cipal object of the trip was to carry down
men and machinery. She will probably
arrive this morning.

THEIR LETTERS
OF ACCEPTANCE,
McKinley and Hobart Are
About to Commence
Writing.
THE TWO GREAT ISSUES.
Protection and Sound Money of
Equal Importance With
the Major.
OHIO' 3 CAMPAIGN OPENING.
Senator Sherman and Senator-Elect
Foraker Will Speak at Co urn bus
Next Saturday.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 9.â This week will
be one of the quiet ones in Canton. One
or two delegations are expected, and Ma
jor McKinley may make two or three
short speeches, butjtte hopes to give a
great deal of time in* the next ten days to
his letter of acceptance. It is likely that
it will be finished by the end of the third
week in August, but he does not expect to
publish it before the Ist of September.
Mr. Hobart will commence work on his
letter very soon, and il the usual custom
be followed be will send a copy of it to
Major McKinley a week or so before it is
given to the public.
Major McKinley's letter will be his
longest and most formal utterance during
the campaign, and he will enter upon a
careful consideration of the two great
issues â "protection" and "sound money."
These Wo issues are almost equal in im
portance iv the opinion of Major Mc-
Kinley, indicated in his speeches-.
Scores of his friends, however, will come
here from various parts of the country,
seeking to impress upon him that popular
interest in the money question is declining,
and by the middle of September the tariff
will be the issue of paramount importance.
HoweVter this may be, Major McKinley is
amply prepared to discuss both issues, and
in his letter of acceptance he will uot
overlook either of them.
The Ohio campaign will be opened on
Saturday next at Columbus. The event
will be of more than ordinary importance.
The meeting will be addressed by Senator
John Sherman and Senator-elect J. B.
Foraker. Senator Sherman's speech on
Saturday will be looked upon very gener
ally as the first step in his campaign for
re-election to the United States Senate.
Senator Sherman says he is preparing bis
speech with great care, and it is his wish
to have it the most effective exposition of
the financial question be has ever made.
The prominence of finance in the poli
tics of the day leads Senator Sherman's
friends to believe that what politicians
rather vaguely term the "logic of the situ
ation" points to the election of Senator
Sherman as his own successor. In a State
which has so many ambitious and able
men as Ohio there is sure to be several
candidates for the place, and Mr. Sherman
will no doubt find some opposition when
the next Legislature meets to choose his
successor. The name of Mark Hanua is
frequently mentioned in connection with
the Senatorship, but wholly without the
warrant of Mr. Hanna himself.
The Columbus meeting will call forth
Mr. ioraker's first political utterances
since the week of the convention at St.
Louis, and there is always a vast deal oi
interest both to see and hear him. He has

DEPART FROM CHICAGO.
Mr. and Mrs. Jtryan Speeding On to
Veto York.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. B.â William J.
Bryan left Chicago for Pittsburg, by the
Pennsylvania Road, at 11:30 o'clock to
night. Mr. and Mrs. Bryan departed from
the Clifton a few minutes after 11, after
shaking bands with a large number of
people gathered to say good-by, and were
driven to the Union station, accompanied
by the members of the Chicago reception
committee. They had secured berths in
the regular sleeper and retired as soon as
the train drew out of the station. Hon.
Richard P. Bland will accompany Mr.
Bryan to New "York, and tbey occupied
berths in the same coach.
To-day was really a day of rest for Mr.
Bryanâ one of tne few he has succeeded
in passing since his nomination here
nearly a month ajro. Mr. Bryan is a good
sleeper and despite the intense heat of last
night he rested well and did not leave his
bed until nearly 10 o'clock. After break
fast he and Mrs. Bryan took a carriage at
the Clifton House, where they were stop
ping, and drove to the Englewood Pres
byterian Church, a beautiful structure at
Sixty-fourth street and Yale avenue,
where they attended divine service. They
selected that house of worship because
the temporary minister, Rev. John Clark
Hill of Austin, 111., is to be the pastor of
their church at Lincoln and they wanted
to meet him. Mr. Hill recently received
a call to the First Presbyterian Church at
Lincoln and will go there in a few weeks.
After the service they returned to the
Clifton and had dinner. Then both took
a nap until 5:30. At 6 o'clock Mrs. Bryan
went to the main parlor of the hotel and
received a large number of people who
were waiting to see her husband. Mr.
Bryan received in his room. Many of his
local supporters called. One of his visi
tors was General Warner of Ohio, presi
dent of the National Bimetallic League,
the father of the new silver party.
Mr. Bryan's plans at New York and for
his New England trip are in a stats of un
certainty. It is probable that while in
New York he and Mrs. Bryan will be the
guests of William P. St. John, treasurer
of the Democratic National Committee,
who recently resigned his position as
president of a National bant because of
his free coinage views.
If they do not stop with Mr. St. John,
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan will go to the Hotel
Bariholdi. Mr. Bryan does not know
whether he will adhere or not to nis rail
road schedule from Pittsburg to New
York. He bad decided to leave Pittsburg
Tuesday morning at 7:30, but he was in
formed to-day that the National Commit
tee wanted him to reach New York on the
afternoon and not on the night of that
day. To comply with this desire he will
be obliged to leave Pittsburg at 3 o'clock
Tuesday morning.
VOYAGE UP GREAT PERIL.
Imprisoned in Limitless Field $ of Drifts
ing Icebergs.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 9.â After
a long delay which has caused considers
ble anxiety tiie British bark lodine, Cap
tain Bartlett, the first of the Greenland
fleet of cryolite traders, arrived in port to
night.
Her voyage was one ot extraordinary
peril, and she narrowly escaped being;
crushed by towering icebergs while im
prisoned in fields of drift ice, to which
there appeared to be no limit. The
iodine left Ivigtut on June 26
last. When she left Irigtut the
weather was still very cold, by
reason of the great ice drifts, which, the
natives said, showed that the winter in
the Arctic region had been very mild.
Captain Bartlett reports that the chance
to reach the far north was better this year
than ever before. The fjords are teeming
with salmon and other Q*_.
A STEER WRECKS A TRAIN.
Engine, Tender and Four Coaches Thrown
From the Track, but Miraculously No
One Is Killed.
LINCOLN, Nsbb., Aug. 9.â Passengers
on the delayed Billings (Montana) train at
midnight tell of a damaging wreck on
that branch of the Burlington, which has
not yet been reported, though it occurred
Thursday night, forty-seven miles this
side of Sheridan, Wyo.
The train was running at a lively rate of
speed when a Wyomine steer was encoun
tered in a cut opening out upon an em
bankment about twenty-five feet high.
The shock threw the engine, tender and
every one of the tour coaches off the track,
making one of the worst looking wrecks
imaginable.
Fortunately no one was killed. Engi
neer Tom Haley was badly bruised in tha
shoulder and Fireman Shannon had his
feet scalded. Tha passenger list was light
and the casualties consisted of nothing
more serious than bruises and joltings.
The property damage is large and the
passengers were obliged to wait twelve
hours before the wreck was cleared away.
With nearly every car demolished and
the occupants piled in the wreckage, it is
considered a miracle that none were
killed or badlyynjured.
SANTA FE ASSASSINATION.
Young Lawyer Gets His Death-
Wound While Making a
Bryan Speech.
The Deed Wrapped in Mystery, as It
Is Not Yet Learned Who
Fired the Shot.
MEMPHIS, Tekn., Aug. 9.-Word has
been received here of the probab'e fatal
shooting at Santa Fe, .N. Mex., Friday
night, of W. 8. Hemingway, Assistant
United States District Attorney, and
prominent in law and politics in the Ter
ritory.
The shooting occurred under peculiar
circumstances. Mr. Hemingway was one
of the speakers at a Bryan ratification
meeting, and while in the middle of his
address a shot was fired from the audi
ence, the bullet striking him in the abdo
men. It has not yet been learned who
fired the shot.
Young Hemingway is a grandson of
Senator George of Mississippi. His father,
J. B. Hemingway, was formerly United
States District Attorney at Santa Fe. The
young man went to the Territory only
eighteen months ago. The news of the
shooting was first received by his relatives
to-day. _____ _________
CLOUDS OBSCURE THE SUN
Preventing Observation of Its
Total Eclipse by Several
Expeditions.
At Odessa the Weather Was Fairly
Clear and tb.9 Astronomers Were
More Successful.
LONDON Eng., Aug. 9.â Much interest
exists in astronomical circles as to the suc
cess of the several expeditions sent out to
various parts of the world to study the
total eclipse of the sun which occurred to
day.
A special dispatch to the United Asso
ciated Presses from Vadsoe, Norway,
timed at 8:05 o'clock this morning, says
that the members of the expedition sent
to Varanger Fjord were unable to take
any observations that will be of value.
The early phase of the eclipse was clearly
seen, but its totality was obscured by thick
clouds, which rendered the taking of ob
servations impossible. The temperature
at the beginning of the eclipse was 44.
During the eclipse it fell to 42 and then
rose again to 44, when the shadow had
passed from the sun.
Among the observers at Varanger Fjord
was Sir Robert Starwelt Ball, professor of
astronomy and geometry in the University
of Cambridge and director of the Cam
bridge Observatory.
News from the other stations, some of
which are far from civilization, is anx
iously awaited.
It is earnestly hoped that the American
expedition at the Island of Yezo, Japan,
and the expeditions at Nova Zembla and
in Eastern Siberia, will obtain results that
will be of great benefit to science.
BT. PETERSBURG, Russia, Aug. 9.â
The weather was cloudy to-day, rendering
useless all the preparations made to ob
serve the eclipse of the sun.
ODESSA, Aug. 9.â The weather here
was fairly clear and good observations of
the eclipse were made.

AT SANTA CRUZ
Athletic Exercises Under
the Trees at Russell
Racetrack.
Â£ ABLY MORNING PARADE
The Sound of Bugles Arouses
Residents From Their Late
Slumbers.
WAND DRILLS AND SINGING-
An Interesting Programme Rendered
in the Great Pavilion at
Night
SANTA CRUZ, Cax., Aug. 9.â Those
who attended the sixteenth Bezirk Turn
fest â and their names were legion â spent
most of the day in the grateful shade of
the grove at the Russell racetrack, about
one mile from town. The shooters hung
their powder-horns on the boughs, and
this made certain portions of the grove
almost typical hunting scenes. Beneath
the trees also each visiting delegation had
its own exclusive and sacred spot, with its
banner tacked aloft, and its chairs, tables
and its own private keg.
There were plenty of refreshments of all
kinds, and the crowd tbat assembled there
to see the sports of the day was one of the
most orderly that ever gathered at the
racetrack. An expansive dancing plat
form with convenient seats had been
erected in the midst of the shade, and
Hastings' band supplied dancing music
for the young people from 11 o'clock in
the morning till 6 o'clock in the evening.
It is hardly necessary to say that the
platform was filled for each number by a
jolly crowd, which flaunted the festival
colors in the breeze created by the dance.
Carriages carried the multitude to and
from the grounds all daylong. Not less
than 10,000 people visited the grounds
during the day.
Over the stubble of a wheatfield at one
si^e of the grove the bullets of the free
for-all public shooting contest sang their
way to 200-yard distant bullseyes. There
was a danger sign to warn strollers away
from the path of markmanship, and a
sentinel was stationed in that direction as
an additional precaution. A sort of arena
was fenced in at one side of the grove, in
which the parallel bar ana horse vaulting
exercises took place. Conveniently at one
side, in plain view of the crowd, the hori-
/Alfred Furth, Leader of the Sar\ Francisco Jurrv Vereir\.
zontal barÃ, with their sustaining tip- }
rights, were anchored, so that the crowd j
could view both exercises at once if they
had lively eyes. The frequent outbursts of
applause indicated that the ensemble of
athletic events was viewed by nearly all.
Santa Cruz was awaKe at an early hour
this morning. She was awakened by the
drum corps of the San Francisco Turn
Yerein, which beat a reveille. The various
:<â  "tions of the morning parade, tired from !
the long procession or the night before, |
did not get into line till 8:45 o'clock, but j
at that time the march to the grounds was j
besrun.
F. R. Walti was also grand marshal of
this second parade. He lÂ«d the proces
sion in such fine style the night before
that he was chosen to repeat the opera
tion. After him came the \>aiid. Then
ti.ere was a pretty effect in a cluster of
fiag-bearers, holding aloft the banners,
the flags and the colors of all the visiting
societies. The ladies' class of the Santa
Cruz Turn Verein came next They were
twenty-five in number. The ladies wore
white straw hats, adorned with the Ã¼bi
quitous red and white colors, ending in
streamers floating gently behind. The
next section of this early morning parade
was composed of the instructors of the vari
ous societies represented at the Turnfest.
They were fifteen in number, and were at
tired in the lizht-colored shirts and trous
ers of the athletic classes. The San
Francisco Turn Verein Drum Corps
awakened the matin echoes on the com
paratively deserted streets. The sleepiest
heard their noise, arjd awoke to the
iact that a programme of excellent
athletic exercises was about to be opened.
Saturday Night Scene at Sarvta Gruz When the Visiting Turners paraded to Their Headquarters.
Following the drum corps came the San
Francisco Schuetzen Society, 50 strong.
They presented a pay and picturesque ap
pearance with the graceful feathers in
ttieir hats, and breasts decorated with the
medals of many a contest won. The San
Francisco Turn Veiein, about 55 in num
ber, composed the next phalanx. They
were in the Turner uniform of lizht
colored shirts and trousers. The San
Francisco Eintracht, 40 strong, in the
same uniform, followed. In the following
order came the San Francisco Mission
Turn Verein, 35 in number; the San Jose
Turn Verein, 100 members in line; the
Oakland Turn Verein, 35 members; the
San Francisco Germania Singing Society
with 25 singing members ; the Santa Cruz
Turn Verein with 175 in line; the San
Francisco Harmonic Society with W)
marching members, and the San Fran
cisco Arion with 40 vocalists in line.
The forenoon exercises at the grounds
comprised, chiefly, rehearsals for the com
petitions down on the programme to fol
low in the afternoon. There were exer
cises on the horizontal and parallel bars
and the mass and class wand exercises.
These competitions proceeded with much
vigor aDd interest in the afternoon, and as
each particularly good and graceful turn
was made on the bars or on the leather
horse the crowd applauded enthusiasti
cally. It was a peculiarity of this crowd
that it seemed to know a good thing in
athletics when it saw it, but that is in all
probability a faculty peculiar to the spec
tators of Turner society events.
Conrad Flach, the instructor of the
Banta Cruz Turn Verein, is gymnastic
leader of the festival. The following
judges were chosen: Judges for horizontal
barsâ T. Utte, Mr. Hauser, Mr. Rinse;
judges for parallel barsâ R. Bartb, O.
Freund, L. Gerichten; judges for vaulting
horseâ H. Stahl. Ed Popp, Fred Fischer;
judges for wand exercises â L. Weber, F.
Fischer, C. Wiedemann; judges for the
first group ol horizontal barsâ H. Riiter,
J. Denbaum, Albert Fuerth; judges for
tirsi group on parallel bar â C. Wiede
mann, Mr. Lutz, Mr. Kortstein; judees of
first group for vaulting hore â Mr. Roemer,
Mr. Websr.
The societies that took part in the wand
exercises were: The San Jose Turn
Verein, the &an Francisco Vorwaerts, the
Oakland Turn Verein, the San Francisco
Eintracht, the San Francisco Turn Verein,
the San Francisco Mission Turn Verein
and the Sania Cruz Turn Verein. There
are three grades in the wand exercises, the ,

first named being the highest: Third
grade, ten men; second grade, iwenty
nine men; first grade, fifty-seven men.
The competitions on the leather-horse
in the afternoon comprised forward and
rearvaulting, crossing-leg vaulting, side
and lengthwise vaulting, etc. ; on the hori
zonal-bar â muscle-swinging, giant swing
half-giant swing, Kippe swing; vaulting
and the straddling rear and high vault.
In these several athletic features of the
afternoon there were at least 200 competi
tors, all energetic young men. The com
petitors must go through all the various
exercises, including throwing the sixteen
| pound shot, high jumping and hop, skip
and jump, and those getting the highest
average out of a possible forty will win tne
prizes at the end of the contests. The re
sults of to-day's contests were withneld
by the judges, and the final result wili be
announced" and prizes awarded to-morrow
at midnight, in the grand pavilion.
The gymnascic exercises took more time
at the grounds in the afternoon than was
anticipated, and the dumbbell exercises
by the Bears (men between 40 and 70 years
of age), the club-swinging exercises by
young ladies and the oration by Albert
Currlin, president of the Pacific Turn Be
zirk, were postponed until evening with
the remainder of t' c programme in the
pavilion. The prize recitals which were
to have been given in the Santa Cruz Turn
Verein ball in tne afternoon were also
postponed to the evening.
A great crowd was present at the pavil
ion in the evening. The main floor, a
great white space about 70 by 125 feet in
dimensions, was left clear for the exer
cises. The spectators were ranged in long
rows around each side. Opening the ex
ercises L. H. Wessendorf, vice-president
of the Santa Cruz Turn Verein, introduced
Mayor Clark of Santa Cruz. The Mayor
said:
"I was out on the grounds to-day and
saw a fine and orderly crowd. The "char
acter of the German nation was displayed
in the Turn Verein. It is a sturdy char
acter. We hope you will come again. We
hope this will not be the last time we
shall see you. We shall try to make it as
disagreeable for you as we can." [Laugh
ter.]
He then introduced Mayor Davie of
Oakland, who said: "I believe in physi
pov) the Jolly Turners Spervt the Sabbath at Sarvta Cruz.
cal culture. I belie\e it is the salvation of
our country. We will live to see the time
when the German mothers of this country
will raise the children soldiers of the coun
try, and alt you will have to do is to sound
the butfle for them and they will come. I
have three active members of tne German
societies. They are my sons. No people
could have been so orderly under the cir
cumstances to-day as the Germans."
"The grand march "El Capitan" was
played by Hastings' band as an introduc
tion to the remainder of the programme.
Then followed the mass chorus, "The
Young Musicians," by all the singing
j societies, which was enthusiastically en
cored. A festival poem composed by
Charles Roller was dramatically read by
Vice-President Julius Meyer of the Sah
Francisco Harmonic Society. Then pame
a fine barytone solo, "The Heart on the
Rhine," by John Plagemann, whose fine
voice filled the entire pavilion.
To an inspiring air out into the broad
white of the floor marched eight young
ladies wiih Indian clubs in their hands
j and took positions for an exhibition of
I club-swingmg under the leadership of H.
Reiter of San Jose. They wore dark
bloomers, dark hose, black slippers, white
waists, turnover collars and black ties.
! The club* were black. The bloomers per
i mined a very graceful freedom of action.
When these young ladies, who were from
San Jose, concluded this attractive feature
of the programme, somebody among the
spectators proposed "Three cheers for
San Jose." and they were given from every
part of the pavilion. The young ladies
belong to the Young Ladies' Class of the
San Jose Turn Verein. They were Misses
Clara Schni'.fspan, E. Menn, Lillie Haver,
Josie Scbnitts;>an, Lena Guntber, Ida
Gotdbach, M. Schhittspan, M. Colombet.
About 2QQ young men in the Turner uni
| form took the floor next, and, with wands
in hand, marched around the hall several
times to the music oi the band, prepara
tory to the competitive wand drills. Nearly
every city in the Bezirk was represented
by its wand-drill corps. The wands were
steel tubes about three feet long, nickel
plated. The evolutions were slightly dra
matic and Amazonian in character, and
frequently brought out applause from the
thousands of admiring spectators. The
evolutions were commanded by Conrad
Flach, gymnastic leader of the Turnfest.
Wnile the young men with the wands
stood at parade rest the oration of the day
was delivered by Albert Currlin of
San Jose, president of the Pacific
Coast Turn Bezirk, who spoke in Ger
man. President Currlin extended a
greeting to all to the sixteenth
Turnfest Bezirk, and wished that the
members would add more laurels to their
brows than had ever been gained before.
He said that a proud past was theirs and
it was their duty to see that the future was
not less worthy of praise. He said that
though the cause of the turners was op
posed at the start, it had gained success
worthy of the praiseworthy object for
which it was instituted.
"Parents, you cannot leave your chil
dren a better inheritance than a durable
health," he said. "You well know that
we turners give our youth not onfy a
healthy body but also a healthy spirit.
There is a higher aim to work for than the
almighty dollar. Germans, you commit a
crime if you do not teach your children
the mother tongue. Do you think you
are good citizens of this country if you do
not esteem the language of the Father
land? It is the duty of every member of
the North American Turner Bund to pro
test agairjst the plutocracy which is be
ginning to take hold in this country and
which, if not destroyed, will soon carry
tnis mighty Republic to the grave. Good
luck for the turners, good luck for the
American youth, good luck for this
Nation." [Cheers and applause.]
The Danube sone- waltz, rendered in
magnificent harmony and style by the
mass chorus, concluded the evening pro
gramme in the pavilion. A longer pro
gramme had been arranged, but owing to
the lateness of the hour the numbers were
continued until to-morrow. The wand
drill was an exhibition only, it being de
cided at the pavilion to continue the com
petitive drills until to-morrow.
To-night Albert Metzer of Santa Cruz
and L. Weber of San Jose were appointed
the score committee for the shooting con
tests of the turnfest.
The free-for-all prize-shooting contest
was largely patronized this afternoon.
There were twenty prizes, amounting to a
total of $125, ranging from $1 50 to $25, the
highest prize. J. Utschig made a score of
90 and won the first prize of $25; F. Ottin
ger 88 and the recond prize of $20, and C.
E. Huback 85 points at the 200-yard range
and the third prize of $15.
The programme for to-morrow, in addi
tion to the athletic exercises continued
from to-day, is as follows : At 7 o'clock,
swimming in the bay; at 8, procession to
the grounds. After arrival there will be
field exercises, consisting of pole-vaulting,
high jumping, distance jumping, step,
hop and jump, distance high jumping,

6P. M. At 6 p. m., return to town. At 9
p. M., grand ball in the carnival pavilion.
At midnight the prizes wili be distributed.
LEFT BY PREHISTORIC MAN.
Footprints of a Monster Human Are Found
on the Rocky Seashore Near
Westcoast.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 9.â The steam
schooner Mischief, Captain H. R. Foot,
which has just returned from Westcoast,
brings news of a peculiar discovery re
cently made by Mr. Leeson, the only
storekeeper living in that sparsely settled
little seabound village. The find was tbat
of footprints, antedating, it is supposed,
the Adamites, and mutely telling of
a race of giants who, according to
the researches and teachings of archeol
ogy, inhabited this earth in prehistoric
years.
What mainly bears interest in the dis
covery is that it was made on the Pacific
Coast, for although evidence of these ex
tinct creatures have been found along the
Mississippi and elsewhere on this conti
nent nowhere in the West has anything
of the kind ever been previbusly locateu.
The footprints are known to but one, the
finder, and he, realizing the fortune in
their preservation, announced his inten
tion to Captain Foot of securing at least
one of the monstrous imprints by cutting
a square block out of the solid rock in
which it appears. This rock is situated
on the water front, and from it the foot
prints can be traced in a winding and regu
lar course up the steep embankment until
lose in the indistinctness of moss and
shrubbery. One of these imprints, and
that nearest the water, measures four
inches deep by twenty-nine inches long
and bears in exact and perfect outline the
impression of a naked foot. A distance, of
four feet between each track gives evi
dence of the uniform step of the stranger.
SANDY'S DESPISED DEAD,
Murderer Thiede's Body Denied
a Resting-Place in the
Town Cemetery.
Relatives Avert a Bloody Conflict
With Citizens by Exhuming
the Remains.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 9.â The body
of wife-murderer Charles H. Thiede, who
was hanged here on Friday, was interred
by his r iative.s on the afternoon of the
day of the execution, in the cemetery at
Sandy, a small town fifteen miles south of
Salt Lake.
The citizens strongly objected to the
body of the murderer being buried in
their little cemetery, and it appeared that
the relatives of the murderer, anticipat
ing opposition, had the grave secretly
prepared without the knowledge of the
ecclesiastical board and conveyed the re
mains by a secluded road to the spot, so
that the body was laid away before any
but the relatives knew of it,
The citizens became very angry and
held a mass-meeting and sent representa
tives to Thiede's people asking that the
body be removed within twenty-four
hours. The demand was refused, and the
committee threatened to exhume it in the
night and throw it into the river.
The dead man's relations armed them
selves to the teeth and kept guard con
stantly at the grave since Friday night.
In the meantime the sentiment against
leaving the remains in the cemetery
grew stronger. Those guarding the body
were re-enforced and a conflict was only
averted by the murderer's relatives capitu
lating. Under force they signed an agree
ment to permit the body to be removed,
and at midnight to-night the despised
remains will be exhumed and reinterred
in a field adjoining the cemetery.

NEW ORLEANS, La., Aug. 9.âWednes
day night last in St. Charles Parish, Jules
Gueymaud, a storekeeper, was assassina
ted while standing on his front porch. A
Sicilian named Lorenzo Saladino was
known to have had a grudge against Guey
maudand and he was suspected. Circum
stantial evidence caused his arrest on
Friday. The Sheriff had great difficulty
in preventing the people from lynching
Saladino then and there, and secretly con
veyed the prisoner to Habnville, the
county seat, and placed him in jail. Tnis
prison is a new brick structure, and was
guarded by a negro night watchman who
has performed the duty for several years.
Two other Italians named Decino and
Angelo Marcuso, were confined in the jail
for the murder of an aged Spaniard on
one of the plantations.
About midnight last night a mob of
about fifty persons, well armed, surprised
the guard, battered down the doors of the
jail and took out the three Italians. The
prisoners cried and begged for mercy, but
the crowd took them to a stable a short
distance away, gave them two minutes in
which to pray and then strung up all
three of them by the necks 10 the rafters.
The crowd stood around a few minutes
until the bodies ceased to struggle an 4
then opened fire with their Winchester
rifles on the dangling forms, literally
riddling them with bullets. The lynchers
then quickly dispersed.
The news soon spread and by daylight
a big crowd gathered where the three
bodies were yet hanging, presenting a
ghastly sight. It is said the lynching
party came from St. Gabriel, the 'former
home of Gueymaud, but none of the men
were recognized.

STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 9.â The water
melon run of the Terminal City Wheel
men was a great success. Every prepara
tion had been made to give the visiting
cyclers a good time. That they had one
there can be no doubt, judging from their
words of praise. The morning boats
brought hundreds of wheelmen from all
the bay towns. Few clubs were not repre
sented, and there have never been so
many wheelmen in Stocki/w at one time
before. The streets were crowded with
the visiting cyclers to-night, and they
made merry until a late hour, parading
the streets, sounding their club yells and
with their colors flying.
For weeks past the committee having
charge of the run has been hard at work
perfecting its arrangements. It has had
the assistance of all the club's members
and of the other local organizations, both
in the actual labor of arranging for the
affair and in the preliminary runs held for
the purpose of advertising it. The Ter
minal City Wheelmen were confident of
success, because they had received so
many assurances from members of out
side clubs all over the State that they
would participate in the outing. Their
expectations were more than realized, for
when the procession of wheelmen formed
this morning it was nearly eight blocks
long.
The Sixth Regiment band had been en
gaged, and at an early hour began to play
in front of the clubrooms of the Terminal
City Wheelmen, on Butter street. Here
the local men kept open house all day and
entertained those who made trips into
town frem the grove.
When the procession had formed it pro
ceeded through the principal streets of
the city, greeting the citizens at all times
with club yells and cries and the univer
sal cry of the long line of wheelmen:
Keep a-singin',
Keep a-yellin'â
Watermelon,
Watermelon !
Out to Goodwater Grove this long string
of wheelmen went, a corps of lady cyclers
leading the van. Hundreds of unattached
wheelmen, with their wives and sweet
hearts, joined the parade, and at every
crossing the length of the procession was
increased. Many had their wheels hand
somely decorated, and the long line of
wheelmen and fair cyclers presented a de
cidedly pretty appearance.
As ihe grove was reached each club gave
its yell as the riders belonging to it passed
under the gates and sought the cooling
shade of the great oaks that cover the
grounds about me clubhouse and dancing
pavilion. Each club secured a favorite
tree and stacked its wheels at the foot of
it. Then all went in for jollity and that
element of pleasure held sway for the rest
of the day. The band began to play for
the dancers long before the noon hour,
and even the great watermelon feast could
hardly lure some of the wheelmen from
the dance hall.
A lunch was served during the after
noon and at 3 o'clock the great pile of
watermelons were placed before the
throng that was hungry for the luscious
red fruit from Lodi's soil. All last night
and early this morning the growers of
watermelons could be seen driving into
town with their wagons well filled with
ripe melons, so there was no lack of an
adequate supply to-day when visitors and
Stocktonians fell to demolishing the fruit.
When tne feast was over dancing was once
more engaged in.
The grove presented a pleasing sight
this morning when the procession of
wheelmen entered the gates and stood
grouped about under the trees.

CINCINNATI, Ohio, Aug. 9.â Clarke lost his
temper in the eighth inning to-day over a
third-base decision and struck Umpire Lally.
Several blows were exchanged before the play
ers separated them. Both were arrested and
taken to the station-house. Rhines umpired
the last inning. Louisville had a batting
streak in the sixth inning, and, aided by mis
erable fielding, scored three runs. Hill pitched
a good game, but his support was very rag
ged. Attendance 6000. Score: Cincinnatls

CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 9.â The Browns put up
a miserable fielding game to-day, which was
in marked contrast to the work of the Colts.
Hart kept the hits well scattered except in
the fourth, but the errors came at inoppor
tune times. Briegs wot effective at critical
stAges, but allowed six bases on balls. Ever

STOCKTON, CAi., Aug. 9.â The base?
ball game here to-day between the Stock
ton nine and a picked team from San
Francisco, playing under the name of the
Will & Fincks, was one of the best of the
season, but it ended in a row, to the dis
credit of the visiting team.
Lochhead and Pace, and Fitzpatriok and
Peters were the batteries for Stockton and
Will & Fincks respectively. Lochhead
did great work in the box, striking out
seven men, and if he had been given his
dues by the umpire, he would have had
ten strike-outs to his credit. Up to the
last inning the visiting team had slightly
the better of the score. In the ninth the
StocKton men went to bat with Hickiri
hqtham up. He had been struck out every
time before, but this time was hit by Fitz
patrick and went to first. Babe White
then lined out a double that brought
Hickinbotham home, and then Lochhead
sent out a two-baeger that brought White
over the plate. Pace then went to the bat
and knocked the ball over the fielder's
head for a home run. The sphere was re
turned to Peters, and he secured it just as
Pace crossed the plate. In his run Pace
ran into the catcher of the visiting team,
knocking him about ten feet. The
manager of the Will <fe Fincks protested
against Pace's run counting, but the um
pire was farm. As Manager Campbell of
Stockton had paid off the visiting team,
the latter had nothing more at stake, and
refused to play longer, making the score a
tie. Following are the runs by innings:

SPORT AT SANTA MONICA.
Pirtt Heat of the Annual Swimming
Context Won by Carrillo.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., August 9.â The
first heat of the second annual swimming
content of Southern California was raced
here to-day from the beach in front of the
North Beach Bathhouse to a buoy one
sixth of a mile from shore and return.
There were six entries â Leo Carrillo, Joe
Hart, H. Tsueda, I. R. Sheckels, William
Rano, the two latter withdrawing prior to
the race.
The start was a superb one, Carrillo and
Hart taking the lead and the Japanese
and Sheckels following. It was a pretty
race between the leaders to the buoy, they
keeping even all the way. Carrillo turned
a little ahead of Hart, and from thereon
kept gaining in spite of his antagonist's
efforts until he reached the starting point,
the winner of the race. Time, 12 minutes;
Hart second, 14 minutes. Sheckels, who
was distanced, claims to have become
sick. Roy Jones, manager of the bath
house, presented the prizes to the success
ful swimmers before an immense audi
ence.
The second and final heat will be con
tested next Sunday from the same place
over the same course.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 9.â The five-mile
paced record of 13:23 2-5 was broken this

RACING AT WOODLAND,
Horsemen Arriving With Their
Strings for the Coming
Meeting.
Three Days to Bs Given Over to the
Harness Brigade and Three
to Runners.
WOODLAND, Cal., Aug. 9.â The out
look for the fair and race meet to be given
by the directors of Agricultural Associa
tion No. 40, beginning on August 24 and
continuing six days, is very promising.
When the directors of the fair association
began to entertain a doubt as to the advis
ability of holding a series of races this
year the business men came to the rescue
and subscribed so liberally that the com
ing fair will be a most successful one.
Horses of all grades and classes are ar
riving on every train. Martin & Welch's
string of runners arrived yesterday from
Ingleside and is quartered at the track.
Three days will be given over to the light
harness horses and the last three days to
the sprinters. Reports from all parts of
the State are to the effect that horsemen
are anticipating a most successful meet at
Woodland.
There will be no pavilion display, but
the directors will probably engage Ronco
vieri's band and concerts will be given
every evening. At the meeting held last
night J. B. Ferguson of the Ingleside
track was engaged to start the runners.
THE TOWN OP ESOALON.
A Child of the San Joaquin Valley Rail'
road That Has a Future Before It.
ESCALON, Cal., Aug. 9.â Of the many
new towns that have sprung up in the
State in the past few yeais none have
started out with such a brilliant prospect
of success as the little town of Escalon.
Situated as it is in one of the most fertile
of valleys â the lovely San Joaquin â it has
promise of being one of the most enter
prising villages to be found anywhere. It
is on the line of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railroad, twenty
miles from Stockton and in the heart of
the best grain-producing sections in the
State. Thousands and thousands of acres
under cultivation and irrigated by the
Stanislaus and San Joaquin Water
Company's canal will in time make It an
important grain center. Thus far this
season an average of four cars of grain per
day has been shipped. The Valley Rail
way Company are erecting a handsome,
depot and freighthouse.
WRECKED AT MULL AN.
An Ore Train Roll* Down the Moun-
Jain Side.
MULLAN, Idaho, Aug. 9.â An ore train,
five cars and an engine, is lying down the
mountain side, 1500 feet below the track,
one man is probably dying and two others
are injured, as the result of a derailment
last night. Of the three men, Eli Stoker,
the brakeman of the train, stuck to his
post and was taken from the wreck badly
mangled. A. M. Wilson, the fireman, es
caped with a broken leg.
The railway is one of the sights of the
Cceur d'Alenes. The grade is exceedingly
steep, and the cars are run up by means
of a switchback. It was on the return trip
that the cars ran off the track. The Morn
ing mine will be closed until the train can
be replaced and the track repaired.
ARIZONA'S COMPLAINT.
fraudulent Railway Bond* Validated
by Act of Congres*.
TUCSON, Abiz., Aug. 9.â lt is a matter
of considerable comment throughout the
Territory that while President Cleveland
refused to approve the Congressional bill
authorizing the leasing of the school lands
of Arizona for the benefit of the public
schools, he during the closing days of the
session approved a bill which is an attempt
to validate over $1,000,000 of void and
fraudulent Arizona railroad bonds, and
accrned interest, and which were, previous
to the passage of the law, declared invalid
by the Supreme Court. Not more than
one mile out of five of the roads pretended
to have been constructed, and for which
the bonds were issued, exists. A demand
will be made upon Congress and the Presi
dent to relieve Arizona from this iniquitous
Congressional law. The payment of the
bonds will be resisted by every legal means.
Rotedale'a Suffrage Club.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Aug. 9. âA

portance of the work they undertake, start
out with a determined will and strong
faith in the success of their just cause.

DOUBLE CRIME
AT SAN JOSE,
Vinanzi Crossetti and His
Betrothed Slain by
a Rival.
SHOT IN THEIR TRACKS
Harvey Allender Encounters the
Couple on a Street and
Opens Fire.
MADE DESPERATE BY JEALOUSY
Â«
Awful Vengeance for the Spurning of
His Attentions to the Young
Woman.
BAN JOS.E, Cal., Aug. 9.â The murder
of a young man and a young woman as a
result of jealousy occurred this afternoon
in this city at 3:30 o'clock. The victims
were Vinanei Crossetti and Wally Feilner.
The latter was a young German girl, who
for some time has been employed as a
cook in the family of Mrs. McMillan. For
some months she was engaged to marry
Crossetti, who, with his brother, con
ducted a blacksmith -shop on North Mar
ket street in this city.
This afternoon the young couple went
out for a walk and had reached a point on
North Third street, near Santa Clara, when
suddenly they were intercepted by a
man named Harvey Allender, who jumped
from a bicycle ne had been riding and
made an attempted to talk to the girl.
She would not listen to him and attempted
to get by, when suddenly Allender
whipped out a six-shooter and fired at
her. The bullet took effect in the girl's
neck and she fell. Allender then fired a
shot into her body* as she lay on the
ground.
All this did not require a second of time.
Crossetti did not run away, but was right
upon Allender and attempted to tane the
pistol away from him. The shooter then
turned his pistol upon Crossetti and shot
hint once in the abdomen. The bullet
penetrated the liver, cutting a large
artery, and death ensued in a few mo
ments from Internal hemorrhage.
After being shot Crossetti ran across the
street to the Empire engine-house, where
he expired. Allender started as if to fol
low Crossetti after he shot him, but
stopped suddenly in the middle of the
street, looked at his pistol, and seeing that
a shot remained held it off and fired at his
head. He fell to the pavement and ap
peared lifeless. He was carried into the
engine-house and laid beside his victim,
and when the police patrol wason arrived
at the scene the two men were laid in it
and were hauled to the police station to
gether. The body of the girl was taken to
the Morgue.
At the police station Allender soon re
vived and it was found that he *had not
been injured, the bullet only having
passed through the rim of his hat.
A crowd collected at the engine-honse
and there were loud threats of lynching.
Allender heard these and spoke of them
afterwards at the police station, and it is
believed that he shammed death, thinking
this was a good way to escape from the
hands of the angry crowd.
Allender was formerly a very intimate
friend of the girl, and once proposed mar
riage, but she refused him. Shortly after
this refusal, or about a year ago, Miss
Feilner became engaged to Crossetti. They
had since been very devoted to each other
and were to have been married in October.
Aliender never gave her up, but con
tinually haunted the couple and made
threats against both of them. They re
cently received a number of threatening
letters, containing drawings of skulls and
cross-Dones. As much as possible, Cros
setti and his intended tried to avoid Allen*
der, but on numerous occasions he in
truded hia piesence and threats upon
them. For a while the girl would listen to
him, but recently she determined not to
countenance him in any way, and this ex
asperated Allender.
The unfortunate girl had been in this
country only a few years, and her only
relative here was a sister, who was a
house servant. The girl was well liked by
all who knew her. She was intelligent,
industrious and of irreproachable charac
ter. Crosselti was a blacksmith, a good
mechanic, 24 years of age. He was a
member of the Italian Benevolent Society
and San Jose Hussars, and was highly
esteemed, being of the best habits and in
dustrious.
Harvey Allender, the murderer, talked
freely after he was lodged in the county
prison. When interviewed by a Call
representative he was somewhat nervons,
but did not seem to realize the enormity
of his crime. He was asked to make a
statement, and after he had rolled a cigar
ette and lighted it he told the following
story :
"I have known Miss Feilner over a year.
We used to go together and twice were en
gaged to be married. The first engage
ment was broken off through the influence
of other people, who got the girl down
on me. We became engaged again three
or four weexs later, but had a disagree
ment on March 18, 1895. Since then she
has been going around saying that I had
threatened to chloroform, stab or shoot
her. She was a good girl and I don't
know why she told such stories. She even
went aronnd to the places where 1 deliv
ered ice and told them the same story.
People kept asking me about those threats
and my friends joked me about it until
my life became miserable. I never made
any such threats and didn't want to be
accused of it. I quit my job several days
ago, principally on her account.
"Crossetti and the girl began to keep
company and a couple of months ago a
friend told me that Crossetti was packing
a gun. I was also told that Pisi, one of
Crossetti's friends, wanted to do me np.
I got a gun myself about two months ago.
It was given me by a friend whose name
Ido not care to mention. After that I
saw the girl on the street a few times, but
we did not speak. Hhe kept on telling
stories about me and I decided to speak
to her about it, as she had queered me all
over town.
"1 don't remember all the particulars of
the trouble to- Jay. I was walking south
on North street and saw Crossetti and
Miss Feilner coming toward me. He was
leading a wheel and walking by her side.
I walked between them and the fence, and
then, turning toward her, I asked why she
continued to run around and say that I
had been trying to kill her. I was excited
and don't remember her answer. Cros
setti spoke up and said: 'Go on; get
away. I don't waut any trouble with
you.' I said 1 did not want any trouble
either, but that the talk about me had to
stop. We had a few words and then Cros
setti jumped and put his hand back as if
to get a'gun. I got my gun out like a fool
and began to shoot."
C. Pisi, whom Allender referred to as
wanting to kill him, was an intimate
friend of Venanz Crossetti. He denied
the story told by Allender, and said that
Crossetti never had carried a weapon of
any kind. As to Miss Feilner and the
murderer ever having been engaged, he
stated that he was positive that there was
no truth in the claim, as he Knew that
Miss Feilner had always disliked Allen
der.
Harry Barnes, an extraman for the Em
pire Engine Company, was seated in front
of the engine-house" when the shooting
began. He was sitting with his bacK
toward the street when he beard the first
shot.
"As I turned around," said Barnes,
"the woman was falling to the walk and
the man with the pistol was shooting at
the fellow who was with the woman. The
wounded man started to run across the
street, and I made a break for the tele
phone in the engine-house. I did not see
the murderer try to commit suicide, as I
was inside at the time."
Police Officer James Prindiville knew
both Orosetti, the man murdered, and Al
lender, the murderer, well. He stated
this evening that on Beveral occasions
Crossetti had shown him noies from Al
lender containing drawings of skulls,
crossbones and coffins, and threatening
his life unless he ceased associating with
Wally Feilner, the girl murdered this aft
ernoon. Crossetti, the officer claims, con
sidered the threats a mere bluff on the
part of Allender. He said if Allender did
attack him he would find him unarmed,
as he would not carry a pistol. Crossetti
told the officer he was engaged to Wally
Feilner and expected to marry her during
the wiuter.
Allender, the officer stated, repeatedly
asked him now he could get a permit to
carry a pistol. He claimed that Crossetti
was trying to take his girl away from him
and had threatened him with bodily harm.
Patrick Mulvanev, a boarder at the New
York Exchange Hotel in this city, came
from San Francisco to Alviso with Allen
der on last Friday- He states that Allen
der carried a large pistol at that time and
in explanation said : "A greaser is trying
to steal my girl and has threatened to do
me up when he meets me, and I am taking
the gun for protection."
Helen Feilner, the younger sister of the
deceased and her only relative in this
country, they having come here together
from Germany about four years ago, was
prostrated with grief. She* is also a serv
ant-girl and is highly recommended by
the families by whom she has been em
ployed in San Jose.
About eight months ago District Attor
ney Herrington had an experience with
Allender in connection with his jealousy
of Crossetti. The former came to tue Dis
trict Attorney and toid him that Crossetti
had made threats against him and asked
what he should do. He was taken to
Crossetti's blacksmith shop, and after
hearing both stories the District Attorney
became convinced that Allender was in
the wrong, and that if any dangerous
threats had been made he was the guilty
party. Allender was then advised to
leave the girl and Crossetti alone and he
would have no more trouble.

NEWS OF MARE ISLAND,
The Gunboat Bennington Socn
to Steam Away for
Honolulu.
Eleven Hundred and Sixty-Five Men
Now on the Naval Station's
Payro 1.
VALLEJO, Cal., Aug. 9.â The gunboat
Bennington left the yard yesterday for San
Francisco, where a supply of coal will be
taken aboard. It is the intention then to
proceed North and join Admiral Beards
lee's squadron for fleet drill, after which
the little gunboat is expected to steam
away for Honolulu.
A large force of men is employed on the
Baltimore, stripping it, in order that when
actual work in making needed repairs is
begun nothing will be in the way to hin
der its progress. Six months will elapse
before the cruiser is pronounced ready to
go into commission.
Within the next two weeks the steam
engineering department will take or quite
a large force of men to work on the various
ships in harbor. The other departments
at the yard have about all the force they
can carry. The men are distributed as
follows: Construction and repair, 702;
steam engineering, 205; yards and doefcs.
108; equipment, 71: ordnance, 44; supplies
and accounts, 34; medicine and surgery,
1; total, 1165.
Monday is pay day, and these men will
have the sum of $45,000 dealt out to them
as the result of two weeks' work.
On the 3d of September registrations at
the Labor Board office will cease until
alter the election in November takes place.
For this reason as many men will be taken
on the rolls within the next two or three
weeks as can be used to advantage on the
ships.
To facilitate office work in the construc
tion department all of the clerks and
draughtsmen are to be transferred to newly
fitted up apartments in the construction
building. Word has been received that
the construction department is about to
build a new caisson for the stone dock. It
was feared that this work would be let out
by contract. The building of the yard
tug Unadilla made a record for construc
tion people which has not been over
looked; hence the ordering of the build
ing of the new gate.
A dozen launch engines are to be built
by the steam engineering department to
cost about $600 each. The engines are to
be on hand for use when required.

THE MERCED SUICIDE.
Young Van Heekeren the Last Descend
ant of a Noble House of the
Netherlands.
MERCED, Cal., Aug. 9.â The full name
of the Hollander who committed suicide
in Merced on Thursday was John Van
Broekhuizen Heekeren.
He was the son of the Baron of that
name, now residing at Nymegen, Nether
lands, and, according to the custom of his
native land, was entitled to the title of
Jonkheer, until his accession to the baro
neÂ»cy, which would have occurred at the
death of his father.
The family of the Van Broekhuizen
Heekerens wa3 one of the oldest noble
families in the Netherlands and dates
from the seventeenth century in an un
broken line of descent. The death of the
father of the suicide will mark the extinc
tion of the family name, as the deceased
was the only living son.
The father is an old and feeble man, liv
ing on his estates, which have dwindled
away until at present, although not a poor
man, he is rated as one of the "poor aris
tocracy." A married sister is his only
surviving relative.
The family has not been particularly
noted in the annals of its country beyond
its pride in its ancestry.
The suicide was a queer man â a rover â
and at times acted strangely. He was,
while living in bia native land, a sergeant
in the Schuttery, which corresponds to
our National Guard.
While living in San Francisco some
years ago, when James DeFremery was
consul, he had some difficulty with the
consul, and threw bricks and rocks
through a consulate window to emphasize
his disapproval.
ELOPES FROM WINLOCK,
Mrs, Homer V. Root Runs Away
With Her Husband's
Partner.
The Former San Francisco Detective
Swears Vengeance on
the Pair.
PORTLAND, Ob., Aug. 9.â Homer V.
Root, a Winlock (Wash.) farmer, is here
looking after his eloping wife and her
present companion, "Jack" Frothingham.
He says that if he encounters the couple
Frothingbam will "bite the dust" or him
self will die in the attempt to kill the
eloper.
Root Las traced the runaways to this
city, and he feels confident that they are
here yet. They decamped from his ranch
about a week ago, taking with them $400
in currency and $1100 in bonds, all his
own.
When Root was asked why he did not
invoke the assistance of the police to find
his people he replied that he was a pretty
good detective himself, and besides he de
sired that no arrests be made. He wanted
to handle the business personally. He
said that he and Frotbingham had been
connected with a private detective agency
for three years in San Francisco, making
money at the business. He saved his
earnings, while his colleague squandered
his share on women and cards. About a
year ago Root bought the Winlock farm.
Frcthingham being "broke" and out of
work, he gave him a home.
"For some time past," added Root, "I
noticed that 'Jack 1 and my wife were un
commonly confidential in their talks, but
I thought nothing of it because the idea
never struck me that I was nursing a ser
pent. We have been married ten years,
never having had a disagreement. 1
trusted my wife as I would my life."
Root, taking a note out of his pocket,
said in a choking voice: "Look at that.
That has made me desperate." It read:
My Dear Boy: I know that I am wronging
you, for you are one of the best men on earth,
but "Jack" has so much influence over me
that I must go with him. I can't explain it,
but try to forget me. With much love,
Alice.
Root, returning the note to his pocket,
with tears in his eyes swore he would kill
Frothingham, though he should hang lor
it the next moment. With reference to
his wife he spoke most sympathetically,
claiming she possibly was under hypnotic
influences, in which power he is a firm be
liever. Root proposes remaining here till
he has accomplished his bloody mission
or is compelled to seek the couple else
where. There is no doubt that he is in
deadly earnest about putting a quietus to
hia false friend.
SANTA BARBARA CRUSADE.

CrUtenton.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal.. Ang. 9.â
Charles M. Crittenton, the millionaire
evangelist and founder of the Florence
Crittenton Rescue Home, has been hold
ing a series of successful revival meetings
here. Last night he addressed a great

as he is, a plair business man, more earn
est than dignified, practical rather than
sentimental, sincere rather than eloquent.

MONSTER MEETING
FOR TEMPERANCE,
The League of the Cross
Fills the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
M'KINLEY'S VICTORY.
He Wins the Gold Medal for
the Best Essay of
the Year.
ADDRESS BY THE ARCHBISHOP.
His Grace Speaks to an Immense
Audience and Is Given an
Ovation.
An immense crowd of people gathered
yesterday afternoon In the Mechanics'
Pavilion on the occasion of a grand rally
and essay contest by tne League of the
Cross.
Arrangements had been made for seat
ing several thousand, but the accommoda
tions were wholly insufficient tor the
throngs that packed two floors of the laree
building. Nearly 3000 boys, all members
of the league, occupied chairs upon the
main floor, the tiers of benches all around
were taxed to their utmost, and there was
a decided crush for space round the gal
lery railing. Those who came late were
compelled to stand wherever they could
find room. When the ceremonies began
it was estimated that between 10,000 to
15,000 persons were present.
The exercises were to have opened at 2
p. m., but it took considerable time to
place the various branches and cadets of
the league in their allotted quarters. With
drums tattooing they marched in amid
applause and took their seats, and then
when all were present they presented an
imposing spectacle. The cadet corps in
uniform were drawn up immediately in
front of the speakers' stand, while scat
tered over the floor were the banners of
the league aud American flags. The hall,
too, was draped with the Stars and Stripes
with good effect.
The speakers' platform was reserved for
vice-presidents ana invited guests. His
Grace, the Most Rev. P. W. Riordan, was |
in front, with the Revs. P. C. Yorke, P. E.
Mulligan and Philip O'Ryan, P. Scanlan,
J. -lines McDonald, P. R. Lynch, J. Mc-
Kenna, S.J.,ana several other clergymen
and the Christian brothers. Many prom
inent Catholic laymen were also on the
platform.
After an overture had been played by
the Hebrew Orphan Asylum band, the
audience arose and Hang the "Veni
Creator." The usual prayers of the
league's ceremonies were said and then
Thomas H. Fallon, president of tne
society, called the meeting to order. He
stated* in the course of his remarks that
the League of the Cross had 7500 boys and
600 cadets, all pledged to temperance until
they have reached their twenty-first year.
In explaining the essay contest he said
that rallies were held once a year in each
parish branch, at which prize essays were
read. The winner in each parish was
entered in competition in his district, and
the best essayists of the four districts at
last meet for the "Riordan medal." It I
was for the honor of winning this emblem
that the rally and contest were held
yesterday.
The judges chosen were: Madison Bab
cock, Superintendent of Public Schools;
Professor Bradley of the University of
California, Brother Waiter of St. Mary's
Colleee, Oaklaad, and the Rev. Father
Riordan, B. J., of Santa Clara College.
The competitors were: Sergeant F. J.
Sullivan of Company I, district 1; Lieu
tenant Nicholas Denvir of Company L,
district 2; Sergeant Thomas Eccles of
Company H, district 3; Corporal Benja
min F. McKinley of Company A, district
4. "The Influence of Race and Religion
on the Prevalence of Intemperance " was
the subject of their essays.
The Lrf-aeue of the Cross Chorus gave
"Let the Hills and Vales Resound" und2r
dirpction of Professor Sandy, and Chaun
cev Oicott sang "Rory Darling" and an
other Irish song for an encore.
The essays were read by tne four dis
trict representatives, who were given re
peated ovations.
It fell to the lot of Benjamin L. McKin
ley, a cousin oi the Republican nominee
for President, to win the medal. His es
say evinced a mind remarkably ripe and
well directed for a youth of his years; the
treatment of the subject was broad and
scientific. He investigated the genesis of
races, their environment and develop
ment, taking into consideration at the same
time the efiect of religious thought upon
them. He said :
Bu*. aside from the influence of race and
heredity, the idea of moral responsibility to a
supreme being has always been a powerful
â¢fuctor in the suppression of intemperance. \
The Mosaic law is full of warnings to the
people of Israel of the lurking dangers of tlie
wine-cup, and to this day a drunken Hebrew
is a sight so rare as to cause remark. Many j
there were, iiowever, who cast Aside the law
and the God who gave it, and set up false .
divinities to deify their passions, and enlight- 1
ened Greece and Rome did homage to the god
of drink! What wonder that this religion of
debauchery should perish; that its senseless
idols and its sumptuous temples should be
razed to the earth by barbarian hands, and
tnat the Christian church should rise grandly
on its ruins to leach the doctrines of tem
perance and sobriety I Nineteen centuries oi
progress have not changed those doctrines in
the least; they are proclaimed to-day in every
land where Christian faith has erected an altar
to its God.
All Christian denominations are uniform in
their condemnation of the vice of intemper
ance,, but their methods and their discipline
vary; and partly to these differences of discip
line und partly to the influence of race and
climate must be ascribed the diminished aver
age death rate from intemperance observed in
most Catholic as compared with Protestant
countries.
But the sanction of the lawgiver Is necessary
to give effect to laws whether human or di
vine, and the punishment threatened on the
one hand for transgressions of tne law of God
and the reward promised on the other hand
for its faithful observance must naturally
operate as a check on the passions ot men.
Hence, though race indeed exerts an influence
on the prevalence of intemperance, the most
powerful instrument for the eradication of
this hideous social monstrosity is the heed
which men give through the influence of reli
gion to that solemn note of warning: "Drunk
ards shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
The other essays were creditable efforts,
though sometimes the subject was lost
sight of, and again they took on the hu
mor of a debate. Between the reading of
the essays the audience sang "America,"
Professor Sandy sang "Killarney" and the
chorus "The Flag."
Archbishop Riordan was greeted with
wild applause when he arose to address
the audience. In opening he complimented
Company H of St. Brendan's parish for
making the best appearance. His Grace,
continuing, said: "In tue second place we
tender cur sincere thanks for the great
courtesy of the gentlemen of the Hebrew
Orphan Asylum, to whom we are indebted
for the presence of the Hebrew Orphan
Asylum band, and we are very grateful to
them. This is the way the people of a city
should Jive, one helping the other, whether
of the same religion or not. lam led to
say so particularly because lately we have
been very unpopular with a certain class
of the community. Any one who sees this
audience can see no danger of ns dying
out."
This aroused the vast audience and a
spontaneous burst of applause was the
answer.
The Archbishop expressed his apprecia
tion of the energy and zeal of the spiritual
j director of the leagueâ Father O Ryan.
| "I need not tell you,'' he said, "how mag
j uiiic-ntly he has done and how deeply we
are all indebted to this zealous young
priest. Our heartfelt thanks is also due to
the members of the executive committee,
who are able after a few years to gather
.under the banner of temperance 7500 of
| our young boys.
"This society is organized to train our
j boys in habits of temperance, so that they
I may reach the age of 21 accustomed to
I habits of sobriety and prepared to lead
sober li?es. The greatest and most impor
tant work is the training of youth. We all
of us can cry out all over this land : 'Save
i the boy! Save, the chid!' for the boy
saved will grow up to be an honorable
man whose life will bless others. AH you
who are engaged in this are engaged in a
meritorious and a blessed work."
President Fatlon announced that by
acual count 2674 boys of the League were
on the floor. He introduced Professor
Bradley, D. C, who read the d-cision of
thej udges. When he said that Benjamin
McKinley had won the gold medal, the
boys threw their caps into the air, waved
flags and yelled. The audience was in
sympathy with the boys, for it joined in
the ovation.
The medals were conferred by the Arch
bishop. Sergeant Sullivan was second,
Eccles third, and Denvir fourth.
The ceremonies closed with the "Te
Deum," which was sung by the audience.
ROBBED IN DAYLIGHT.
Lachman & Jacobi Lose $1000
by a Most Dexterous Thief.
A clever robbery took place in the office
of Lachman & Jacobi, on Second and Bry
ant streets, on Saturday forenoon at 11
I o'clock.
At this hour Superintendent Edmund
C. Ciprico returned from the bank, bring
ing with him $1000, which was contained
in two sack*, one having gold and the
other silver, with which it was his inten
tion to pay the help at noon. This amount
he placed in the drawer of a desk in the
office a few feet back from the front desk,
when his attention had been called by some
customers.
Having disposed of the business to which
he had been called, which took about
twenty-five minutes, he unlocked the
drawer for the purpose of dividing the
money according to the amount coming
to each man.
He found the drawer empty, and the
sacks nowhere ih fight. He searched, and
in his search he pulled the desk in which
he had placed the money out from the
place where it stood against two large
wine casks. On examining the bace of the
desk, he found where one of the panels
had been cut above and below the line of
where the drawer was situated, and on the
lower cut was a temporary hinge, screwed
on to the cut portion, which kept it in
place and prevented the screwed portion
from falling out.
This panel had been pushed back in
place as though it had not been interfered
with. Yet the money was gone and the
solution of the theft dawned upon the
bewildered superintendent. He at once
communicated his loss and discovery to
Lachman and Jacobi and they in turn
telephoned the news to Captain Spillane.
Suspicion fell upon a young man named
Eddie Pivell, who had been recently dis
charged by the firm. He was arrested
and locked up in the Central Station
awaiting further developments.
He pleaded entire ignorance of the theft
and claims that he can prove that he was
I not near the piace that day.

SCORES MADE
BY MARKSMEN,
A Lively Day at the Shell
Mound Shooting
Range.
A RUN ON REVOLVERS.
Charlie Daiss Is Again Highest
on the Blanding Pistol
Medal.
YOUNG ALSO MAKES A RECORD
German Sharpshooters and Military
Marksmen Out in Forceâ The
California Club.
There were all kinds of rifle, musket,
pistol and revolver shooting at Shell
Mound yesterday, and the results in the
main were very satisfactory to the marks
men. The regular monthly medal shoot
of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club drew
out a large attendance, and many were
provided with revolvers of several patterns,
so great is the interest of the new revolver
trophy match. Much of the work with
these firearms was of the experimental
order. Among the new members of the
club who have taken to the small arms are
John Paul Cosgrave, who gives promise of
being a good shot ere long, and F. H.
Busbnell, who surprised all by his excel
lent work.
Although yesterday was his first experi
ence with tbe target pistol, his perform
ance shows that he is entitled to be rated
in the first class at least.
C. M. Daiss of the champion class won
back his first position for the Blanding
medal on a score of 1, 2, Iâ41 â 4 on tbe Co
lumbia target. The club's scores made on
the fifty-yard range Columbia target were
as follows:

10, 2, 1, 2, 2, 7, 4, 2, 4â37 ; A. H. Pape 43, F.

fifty yardsâEd Horey 1, 3, 2, 2, 1â9; P. Bohr
10, Mrs. M. J. White 18, R. W. Forrest 47.
The club's competition on the 200-yard
rifle range was just as keen, and in the
rifle-record medal match F. O. Youne
broke the record with 41 In ten shots.
This shows he bunched all his snots in a
4 1-10 inch circle and made what would be
234 on a German ring target. The Colum
bia target count was 2, 2, 2, 7, 4, 3. 4, 7, 8,
2â41. This puts Young ahead of John
Utsehig, who was high man two weeks ago.
The class-medal record and the all
comers re-entry match records, Columbia
target, were as follows:

SAUSALITO'S
MIDNIGHT REVEL
A Carnival to Combine
Beauties of Land and
Sea.
ROCKY POINT VOLCANO.
The Promontory Will Glow
With Many Colors All
Night Long.
A GORGEOUS MARINE PAGEANT
Will Pass Between the Floating Grand
Sand and the Illuminated
Terraces.
Sausahto proposes to hold a carnival to
which the carnivals of other towns of the
Golden State will compare as candies to an
electric light.
Wednesday night at a meeting of the
executive committee it was decided to
make each member of the committee a
chairman of a sub-committee who shall
appoint in the near future his associates.
The members of the executive commit
tee were appointed a follows: Invitation
committee, Commodore C. H. Harrison ;
finance, General Dickinson; committee
on yachts, Commodore I. Gutte; fire
works, Benjamin Marklej ; music, John
T. Harmes; press, bred Raiscb; trans
portation, Wiliiani H. Harmon; illumina
tion, Thomas Frost ; law and order, George
Dott; carriages, An tone Lawrence.
The press committee will consist of J.
H. Pryor, Charles Berry and Edward W.
Parker, of The Call, Kirk of the Exami
ner and F. E. Harmon of the Chronicle.
Out on the bay opposite Sausalito a
grand stand will be stationed that will seat
several hundred people. The stand will
be erected on a float and placed in such a
position that the marine pageant will pass
between it and the illuminated burg.
It is the intention to make a grand dis
play of electricity from the current gener
ated by Sausalito's own plant. This will
be augmented by the plant of the railroad
company. An electrical firm of San Fran
cisco has agreed to furnish all electrical
appliances free of charge.
One of the most striking of all the ideas
presented is the proposition of having
Rocky Point made a volcano of red fire.
The conflagration on this promontory
can be seen by all the cities that border on
the bayâ San Francisco, Oakland, Berke
ley and Alameda. Besides the red fire,
bales of hay saturated with chemicals will
give lights of ail the colors of the rain
bow.
A movement is being made to allow ex
cursion steamers from all over the bay
cities to land, and excursion trains will be
run from Mill Valley, Cazadero and San
Rafael. There will also be run half-hour
boats from 4 until 12- p. m. from all the
ferry points.
The queen of the carnival will be
chosen by vote. Pol ling- places have been
opened at the principal stores of the
town. The cost of a vote is 10 cents.
When elected the queen will have the
authority to appoint her maids.
Some of the hill people who at first
were rather dilatory in favoring the
scheme are now awakening to the fact of
its importance and are subscribing liber
ally. Arrangements have been made
with the Encinal Yacht Club to bring a
procession of yachts from Alameda.
Tiburon has volunteered to join with the
carnival and will furnish all the aid in its
power.
The committee on yachts will consist of
Commodore Gutte as chairman and the
commodores of the San Francisco, En
cinal, Corinthian, Pacific and California
yacht clubs. _
CARNIVAL MASS MEETING.
Sub -Committees Appointed
and Preparations Defi
nitely Begun.
Saturday evening, at the Town Hall of
Sausalito, a large and enthusiastic meet
ing was held to boom the "Night in Sausa
lito Carnival." It was stated that every
ark and naphtha launch on the bay will be
sent over to the festivities. All will be
profusely decorated and illuminated. The
first gleam of t c illumination of the car
nival poured out from the Town Hall win
dows in a blaze of glory. Tne electric
lights have been newly placed in the hail.
The greater part of the evening was spent
in discussing preliminary plans for the
coming event, and listening to the reports
of the Chairmen of the different sub-com
mittees. Judge Pryor reported for Gen
eral John H. Dickinson of the finance
committee nat he bad been promised
considerable financial aid, and that he
hoped all action in regard to the financial
committee be deferred until next Monday
week. He said that the railroad compa
nies would lend their assistance.
Judge Pryor also spoke for Commodore
I. Gutie, who was unable to attend, busi
ness of previous importance detaining him.
Fred Ra'isch, chairman of the Press com
mittee, named as his 'associates the edi
tors of the two papers of Sausalito, Ed
ward W. Parker of the San Francisco
Call, R. C. Kirk of the Examiner and
George Byng of the Chronicle. W. H.
Hannon, chairman of the transportation
committee, named Captain J. T. McKen
zie, Captain W. D. Wilson, Captain W- TÂ«
Tiibble and Charles D. Phelps. Thomas
Frost, chairman of the fireworks, named
Fred Fiedler, Benjamin Ma.kley, B. J.
Killiiea, Frank Tyler and C. C. Bruce.
The chairman of this committee asked for
and was granted five more to serve. George
Dott, chairman of the law and order com
mittee, did not report any names, but
asked for like addition of members.
Thomas Frost, chairman of the illum
ination committee, named Thomas Scul
ley, J. E. Slinkey, Louis Harrison, Jacob
Thomas, J. Deacon, E. J. McCullough,
Daniel de Long and Dr. Crumpton.
B. J. Killiiea suggested tuat a head
quarters be established, where the news
paper men can get all information. It
was resolved that the voting for candi
dates for queen be limited to the ladies of
Sausalito. Judge Pryor stated that he
had perfected all arrangements for the
voting.
This meeting is really the first definite
step toward the carnival. From now on
with the filling out of the committees
ideas will take a form and the enterprise
will go on with increasing rapidity. The
meeting adjourned until August 17.
The following communication was re
ceived by the secretary:

SAUSALITO, Cal., Aug. 9.â Consid
erable excitement is still manifest among
the friends of ti.e poolroom operators,
which wa9 increased yesterday by the
arrest of Colonel J. E. SlinKey, proprietor
of Saus&lito Ball, rented to 'the firm of
Schwartz & Co., doing business as com
mission brokers.
As mentioned in The Call, Schwartz's
employes were arrested, cash ' bail to
the amount of $250 bein â¢ furnished. The
business of the poolroom still con
tinued, opening up this forenoon with a
bi^ crown of sports, and things were run
ning in sta^u quo when, at 2 p. >i., Marshal
Creed, with his deputy, E. Cramer, and
Town Attorney Sylva, made another raid
on the |ooirooms run by Schwartz & Co.
and in loud tones informed the assemblage
that the Board of Trustees had instructed
them t<> clear the room or otherwise all
would be under arrest. A general stam
pede was the result.
The Harrison case is set for next Wednes
day evening, and Bchwartz & Co. come up
for trial on Thursday. Mr. Schwartz has
engaged Attorney W. W. Foote of San
Francisco to defend him at the trial, and
an unusual amount of excitement exists

TWAS QUIET BY THE SEA.
Music the Principal Attraction
in Golden Gate
Park.
Chauncey Oicott Took a Spin on a
Wheel to the Cliff Houseâ Foggy-
Day at the Beach.
There was a good drive and a large num
ber of promenaders in Golden Gate Park
yesterday, but during the entire day noth
ing of an extraordinary nature occurred.
In fact, it was a very quiet Sunday.
The one great attraction was the music,
which was highly appreciated by the
large number of people who listened to it.
The number that attracted the greatest
applause was "II Pastore Svizzero," a solo
for piccolo rendered by A. Logar.
There is evidence of work done during
the week on the bicycle track from the
line of the road that leads to the museum
entrance. The track has been graded and
is now ready for the top dressing. It is
expected that in a few weeks it will be
ready for wheelmen, who then will no
longer be in the way of vehicles.
There were many visitors to the mti
seum. Possibly next Sunday tbe case of
Presidential bronze medals will be dis
played. In the ornithological department
a number of specimens of beautiful birds
have been recently added.
During the day the park police were
summoned by telephone from the Presidio
to look after "a band of cattle that is
roaming in the public park at Mountain
Lake." Captain Thomson and several of
his vaqueros went to the place and found
that the "band of cattle" was nothing
more than two stray horses. They were
taken in charge and were sent to the pub
lic pound.
There was not as much enjoyment at
the ocean beach as usual on account of the
heavy fog. Still there was a big crowd
there, and a good portion visited the
baths, where the attractions were concert
music, swimming and high diviag.
During the forenoon Chauncey Oicott,
in full bicycler's costume, rode out on a
Chauncey Oicott Journeying Toward the
Cliff House in Search of Breakfast.
wheel to the Cliff House and took break
fast with a friend. Kennedy, tne mes
merist and hypnotist, was also a visitor to
t&e Cliff.
The Haight-street grounds attracted a
very large number of people who enjoyed
the many snows offered.
One of the locomotives of the Park and
Ocean road broke down on H street about
a quarter past 4 o'clock and this delayed
traffic for three-quarters of an hour. A
lartre number of passengers had to walk
in nearly a mile to Stnnyan street.
Superintendent John McLaren of Golden
Gate Park has gone to Lake Tahoe on a
ten days' vacation.
Suicide ot a Chinese.
A Chinese, whose name is unknown, a steer
age passenger on the steamship Umatilla,
which arriTed in this port from the Orient
a few days ago, committed suicide yesterday
afternoon by banging himself. The Chinese
attempted to land on the arrival of the steam
ship but was prevented by Government
officials. In consequence, it is presumed he
preferred death rather than return to his
native country, and so committed suicide.

GABRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
FT.KCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
This is to be ft campaign of organized
conservatism against disorganized discon
tent and tomfoolery.
It is reported that Cleveland doesn't like
Hoke Smith any more, so it seems Mr.
Smith must have done something to be
proud of.
Democracy stands for free trade as well as
for free silver coinage, and if Bryan should
be elected the country would be as apt to
get the one as to get the other.
In the flush of its folly at Chicago the
silver Democracy hooted Cleveland out of
the party and it now turns to him with
the cry, "Save me, Cassius, or I sink!"
As Bryan says that eloquence is the
speech of a man who believes what he
says and knows what he is talking about,
we shall have to discount the reports that
he is eloquent.
The most pleasing and cheering feature
of the campaign so far has been the
speeches of McKinley. Jfivery one of them
proclaims the coming of a new prosperity
and rings -with the fervent faith of a true
patriotism.
A conservative Democratic ticket would
be a benefit to the country, as it would
save at least a portion of one of the great
historic parties of the Republic from the
disgrace of the Chicago platform and the
Chicago ticket.
You will take notice that Republican
clubs are working right along for protec
tion to your industry and prosperity to
your home, and you will understand
therefore why you ought to join them
and help the work.
Every loyal Republican can find a
source of satisfaction in the manner in
which the arrangements for the campaign
have been made, and all therefore should
take an active part in it as far as their
opportunities permit.
The idle money now locked up in banka
will be Dut into enterprises and afford em
ployment to every idle man in the country
as soon as the protective tariff is re
established and made the permanent pol
icy of the Government.
The union of all the conservative busi
ness elements of the people in one party
this year should be carried into municipal
as well as National politics and thus bring
about a reform in our whole political
system from top to bottom.
Before this month passes the fusion
scheme between Democrats and Populists
may have vanished like a mist and then
the situation will be cleared up, each
party will stand for itself and every voter
will know what he has to vote for when he
goes to the polls.
No Republican, however ardent he may
be in support of the free coinage of silver,
can afford to bolt the party this year, for
by doing so he not only would endanger
international bimetallism, bat would en
courage the heresy of free trade and the
taxation of incomes.
A Democratic gold ticket would get the
support of all gold monometallists," the
Bryan ticket will get ail the silver mono
metallists, and then the people would see
clearly that the Republican party stands
in the middle of the road as the only genu
ine advocate of bimetallism in the Nation.
If the gold Democrats would only get in
and meet the silver winÂ« of the party half
way by nominating Sewall for Vice-Presi
dent with a goldbug for President so as to
eaualize matters by putting a double head
as well as a double tail to the ticket, the
si i nation would be all that the occasion re
quires.
According to the statistics about 300,000
more books were taken from the Chicago
Public Library than from the Boston
Public Library for tbe last fiscal year and
Boston people ore now explaining that
they own libraries and do not borrow
books as they do in Chicago and other un
cultured places.
In response to a statement that the
business men of New York were all for
McKinley, a Western Democrat is reported
to have answered flippantly that there
were votes enough in the Bowery to over
come them; and now the people have to
decide simply whether they will vote with
the business men or the Bowery boy 3.
As the campaign progresses and men
begin to consider more seriously the re
sults that would follow the free coinage of
silver by this country alone, the enthusi
asm for the white metal weakens, senti
ment gives way to sense, and the sincerest
advocates of free coinage .agree that the
only safe way to bring it about Is to adopt
the Republican policy of international
agreement.
BRYAN AND THE PEOPLE.
Mr. Bryan is now journeying to New
York to be notified of his nomination and
J naturally enougn there is an "outpouring
; of the people" at every stopping point.
I Nothing is more easy iv this country than
to "raise a crowd," but crowds do not in
dicate anything. No itinerant office
seeker ever drew such crowds as General
Scott did when he was a candidate for the
Presidency, but he carried only four
States. Tbe people like to be amused,
and they like information, too, concerning
the affairs of the Nation, but the Ameri
can voter is as coid as a frog when he
goes to cast his ballot. Sentiment, ties of
personal friendship and even the bonds of
consanguinity are held as secondary to
the voter's opinion. This'would not be so
were voters not capable ot determining for
themselves the course to take. Hence it
is that any outpouring of the people in
campaign times counts for little or noth
ing, except when they assemble to further
the cause of a particular party, and then
they do not turn out to be converted, but
to show their earnestness for the side tney
have championed.
It is true, nevertheless, that the people
are quick to see the difference between po-
I litical quackery and logical argument, and
I because they are it would be good practi
cal politics for the Republican campaign
committee to pay the traveling expenses
of Mr. Bryan, and a bonus besides, to
keep him on the hustings. Between Lin
coln and Chicago he made very many
1 speeches, and no better campaign
I work for the Republican ticket could be
done.
He made just two propositions the bur
den of every speech. One was tbe entire
independence of the United States in the
world of commerce, and the ability of this
country to do exactly as it likes in its
j dealings with other commercial nations.
The other proposition was that advan
tages would accrue to labor if it would
assume a hostile attitude toward its co
laborer, capital, on sectional lines. Mr.
i Bryan could not advocate a theory of
I government that would arouse greater
J opposition to his candidacy, and it is
well that the people turn out in crowds
to hear his gospel of brother against
brother and section against section, for
they would know what to expect should
he be elected.
, Mr. Bryan is particularly fond of asking
the crowds in a highly dramatic fashion:
â¢â¢Is not this country big enough to re
monetize silver? Mast we beg Europe to
first give us permission and then aid us in
opening our mints to silver?" For the
moment that kind of taik stirs the
patriotism of the people and sends a
1 whirlwind of enthusiasm through the
crowd, but before Air. Bryan is out of
1 sight the current of thought changes.
The people see that the man is trying to
1 entice them into paths that lead to repu
diation, sectionalism and dishonor, and
all for his own personal political advan*
i tage. Hence we say that Mr. Bryan should
' be encouraged to remain upon the hust
-1 ings until the close of the campaign, for
no one could persuade the people as well
as he can himself that his election would
be a National calamity. The people do
not want our foreign trade destroyed, nor
do they want this country thrown into
sectional strife, and the more they hear
Bryan explain his un-Americanism the
more determined they will be to defeat
his aim and purpose.
WAR VETERANS LEAGUE.
No doubt the attempt will be made by
managers of the Democratic campaign to
discredit the tTnion Veterans' Patriotic
League by charging that it is a Republican
organization in the guise of war veterans,
but the answer will be that were it a Re
publican political machine, it would not
have such stanch Democrats as Generals
Sickles and Siegel for leaders. The fact
is, the League is composed of veterans of
the war of the republic irrespective of
party affiliation, who are impressed with
the gravity of the economic and financial
situation. They are men who believe that
the Altgelds and Bryans are preparing to
attack the. good name and credit of the
Nation, and they are coming to the rescue
of the republic, just as they did a third of
a century ago. It is no more a political
question with the war veterans now than
it was in 1861. Then there was a conspir
acy to divide the Union, and now there is
a conspiracy to bring; discredit and dis
honor upon the republic.
The soldiers of the war of the republic
reunited the country upon a broader and
firmer basis than it was before, and now
they are falling into line to protect tbe
good name and the credit of the republic
against a conspiracy that is formulating
its plans under cover of the stolen mantle
of tne party of Hancock, McClellan,
Sickles and Siegel. It is just as incumbent
upon loyal Republicans and Democrats to
join in the rescue of the Government from
dangers that threaten it in 1896, as it was
incumbent upon them to go forward as one
man to its rescue in 1861.
The oneness, the unity of the country
was assailed wben Sumter was firedjtipon,
and now not only is the commercial honor
and business integrity of the country at
tacked, but there is a conspiracy to deprive
the country's wage-earners of oppor
tunity to employ their skill and muscle,
except at such remuneration as will con
form to the wage schedule of Europe and
the Orient. Is it a crime, in view of these
facts, for the survivors of the struggle
which restored the unity of the country to
now rally to protect the country from
financial and commercial degradation?
It will not do for the Altgelds to cry out
against these Resublican and Democratic
war veterans, nor will it do to question
their honesty of purpose. No doubt there
is a thread of selfishness running through
that which is moving these veterans to fall
in line. There are nearly 1,000,000 names
upon the Nation's war pension roll, which
call for an annual distribution of about
$140,000,000, and it behooves the old soldier
to see to it that his own and his comrade's
pension money is not tampered with or
played upon until its purchase power is
reduced by half, or in any amount. These
veterans are not laying down a policy.
They merely demand that the integrity
and honor of the Nation be maintained,
and without reference to political ties and
associations they are falling into line to
battle on the side that is for tbe mainte
nance of the credit of the Nation. Natur
ally they are advocating tbe election of
Major McKinley, not because he it himself
a war veteran, nor because he is a Repub
lican, but because his candidacy stands for
the preservation ot the Nation's good
name in the world's channels of trade,
commerce and finance.
A DEMOCRATIC FALLACY.
The St. Louis Republic, once the leading
protection newspaper in the Mississippi
Valley, and in recent years the organ of
the Democracy and free trade in the same
region of country, has degenerated into
this kind of economic philosophy: "When
Republicans introduce the question ot
wages and cite the condition of the
workers in Mexico as a sample of the in
fluence of silver legislation, why not bring
into evidence the condition of the worker
ia China or Japan ? Its productive capacity
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 1896.
is the standard of the value of labor, lie
place Mexican labor by American, and
Mexican wages would at once be raised to
the American scale."
The theory that the productive capacity
is the standard of the value of labor is so
fallacious that even the janitor of the Re
public building should know better than
to assert it. In 1865 the total exports of
Japan amounted to $77,000,000 and in 1895
to $296,000,000. The export trade in tex
tiles alone increased from $511,990 in 1885
to $22,177,620 in 1595, but meanwhile the
standard of the value of labor â skilled
laborâ remained the same. That is to say,
textile mill wages between 1885 and 1895
remained an average of 17.4 sen per day
for males and 9 sen tier day for females.
The American dollar is the equivalent of
180 sens. As to the productive capacity of
the Japanese, an eminent authority says:
"The Japanese are gifted with powerful
eyes, hands and brains and the Americans
are terror-stricken at this. The cotton
spinners of Manchester are known to have'
said that while the Anglo-Saxons had
passed through three generations before
they became clever ana apt hands for the
spinning of cotton, the Japanese have ac
quired the necessary skill in this industry
in ten years' time and have now advanced
to a Btage where they surpass the Man
chester people in still. The Japanese are
unrivaled in the world for clevernes* and
their future is truly awe-inspiring to con
template."
The official figures of the productive ca
pacity of Japanese labor in the textile in
dustry show that production of finished
product from 1889 to 1894, both years in
clusive, increased ten times over while the
demand for labor increased only five
times over, and what is true of textiles is
true of all other industrial production.
As we have said, during this period wages
were not advanced at all, but the cost of
provisions â rice, sugar, tea and also fuel â
increased very materially in price. It
would seem that just the reverse of what
tbe Republic says is true in Japan, and
what is true of Japan is true of every
country that is on a silver monetary basis.
The theory that if Mexican la*bor were
replaced by American labor the American
scale of wages would prevail is too silly to
be seriously considered. If it is the skill
of labor that fixes wages the mechanics of
China and Japan should have the highest
wages paid in the world for certain kinds
of labor: and since it is universally admit
ted that as a whole the mechanics of Eng
land, France and Germany have no supe
riors anywhere, they should have as high
if not higher wages than are paid in
America. If the Republic means that the
mere fact of labor being American would
insure high wages it means then that
American labor would overthrow the
Government and establish one similar to
that of the United States. The Republic
should know that the only thing under
tbe shining sun that keeps up the Ameri
can scale of wages is protection against
cheap-labor countries.
EARNEST REPUBLICANS.
The inass-meeting held under the au
spices of tbe Oakland Eepublican Alli
ance last Saturday night was so successful
in point of numbers and entbusiasm that
its influence cannot help being felt else
where. It was not a wild and boisterous
gathering, but rather an assemblage of
thoughtful men who grew in enthusiasm
as the speeches unfolded and held up to
view, the importance of overthrowing the
dangers with which the Bryan following
are threatening the business situation.
It was the entbusiasm that is born of a
determination to protect the country from
wreck and ruin, and if the same spirit of
patriotism which moved the multitude at
Oakland shall pervade the rank and nic of
the party throughout the State, the elec
toral vote of California can be set in the
McKinley column right now. It is not
often that one sees so much earnest
ness depicted on the faces of
an audience as was seen at the
Oakland mass-meeting, bat it is not often
that the commercial and industrial inter
ests of the country are confronted by so
many threatening dangers. The feeling
was general that the salvation of the coun
try is involved in the present struggle for
political supremacy, and hence every one
in that vast assembly felt that he had a
personal duty to perform in the approach
ing campaign.
California is, perhaps, more deeply in
terested in the election of Major Me Kin lev
than almost any other State. This com
monwealth has vast resources which must
be developed to make ber a great State.
There needs to be industrial plants all over
the State, and there needs to be close com
mercial relations with other nations and a
well equipped and amply subsidized mer
chant marine to facilitate international
and coastwise trade interchanges, but none
of these things can be hoped for unless
the McKinley ticket is elected, for Bryan
stands committed to oppose whatever is
calculated to extend tbe commerce and
the industries of the United States. He
denies the right of California to have pro
tection against ruinous foreign competi
tion.
COAST EXCHANGES.
Following the example set by Sacramento,
Fresno and other cities north of her. Los An
geles is about to harness the waters of the
river that has been running unbridled a short
distance from her door, and convert the power
now going to waste into electrical energy.
The undertaking in this instance is the most
magnitudlnous of the kind that has yet been
commenced in the southern part of the State,
and the Fasadena Xnos has this to say of it :
"The plan of the capitalists at the back of the
scheme is to tunnel through the mountains
back of Azusa and tap the San Gabriel River,
bringing the water across country to the
mouth of the casyon, where an immense elec
trical plant, capable of generating 4000 horse
power, will be located.
"The matter was first taken under consid
eration about four years ago. Some idea of
the magnitude of the undertaking may be re
alized when it is known that it will necessi
tate something like 30,000 feet of tunnels and
pipe, the latter to be fitty inches in diameter,
with a carrying capacity of about 4000 inches
of water. The company Is capitalized at $500,
--000, and it is expected that this sum will bo
used to complete the works. It comprises such
well-known capitalists as W. G. Kerckhoff of
the Kerckhofl-Cuzner Mill and Lumber Com
pany, J. H. Shankland cf the law firm of
Graves, O'Melveny & Shankland; A. C. Balch,
recently.of.Portland, Or., under whose- charge
the work is st present; Mr. Dodworth of the
Azusa Ice and Cold Storage Company, and Mr.
Haas of the wholesale firm of Haas, Baruch
&Co.
"When questioned regarding the possible
effect upon irrigation, Mr. Kerckhoff said that
it could not be otherwise than beneficial, as in
all probability the tunnels will increase the
supply of water, besides doing away with
about nine or ten miles of seepage and evap
oration, which must necessarily occur in the
bed of a river like the San Gabriel. As the
water is to be turned back into the original
channel above the present place of diversion
for irrigating purposes, there can be no possi
ble injury in this line.
"The purpose for which the power is to be
used could not be ascertained, but there are
various conjectures. Some believe the im
mense electrical power is to be transmitted to
Pasadena and Los Angeles and applied to the
street railways, while others think the pro
moters have a road of their own in contempla
tion.
"At any rate, the power oDtained will exceed
that now in use ia the city of Los Angeles,
and will be. obtained by utilizing the force
provided by nature, and at a great saving over
the present method."
The Penny Pies* of Santa Cruz was resur
rected last Wednesday, and now appears as an
evening instead of a morning daily. Phil
Francis does tue editing and his wife the re
porting, and they make an excellent combina
tion. Here is the characteristic manner in
which the clever namesake of the author ot
the "Letters of Junius" winds up his first
trumDet-blast in the second coming of the
little paper: "When a job shows its head the
Penny Prets will hit itâ and hit It hard. The
Penny Press loves its friends and hates its
enemies, and it will continue to fight for the
one and to lay the whip on the other. When
it gets done laying the whip on some of these
other fellows it will enjoy an idle day rubbing
pepper and vinegar into the welts."
Los Angeles boasts of anothei new, novel
and very promising industry. According to
the Journal of that city, some time ago a com
pany was organized for the purpose of utiliz
ing the yucca palm in the protection of trees
of tender growth from the rabbits. The ven
ture was a passive success until 'lately under
new management it has assumed large pro
portions. "The factory is located on Santa Fe
avenue, and is to-day not only producing
thousands of tree-protectors and minor arti-
cles, but the discovery has been made that the
plant when green is susceptible of being
molded into any shape and retaining it when
dry, and at the same time being slightly elas
tic. These qualities fit it in an eminent degree
for the use of surgeons for splint purposes.
The porous interstitial nature of the wood
provides air circulation and an opening
through which perspiration and other excre
tions of the body may pass off. These favor
able qualities have so strongly appealed to the
medical fraternity that now the company is
shipping these splints to all the large cities of
this country and some foreign cities. The
yucca plant is a semi-shrub growing some
times to a height of twenty feet and having a
diameter of six to eight inches. These plants
are sawed into various lengths and received
by the company just as a mill receives saw
logs, only in shorter lengths, and the woody
portion is peeled and spread out in thin sheets
like paper, then molded while green in the
form required, giving it the shape of the arm,
chest, leg, foot or any portion of the human
anatomy desired. It is very light In weight."
The Sonoma News believes that the much
talked-of electric road between, Sonoma and
Santa Rosa Is certain to be built. A franchise
has already been applied for.
"The plan of organization is unique, but sim
ple and intelligent," says the News. "Between
$250,000 and $300,000 worth of bonds will be
issued, but the capitalists wishing to insure
the interest on them for at least two years will
issue ticket books, each good for 500 miles of
travel at 1 cent a mile, or $5 for the book, and
the sale of these among the farmers will easily
insure a good interest on the bond issue.
These tickets will be transferable and the
holder and all his family and a carload of his
friends can all travel on the one book. The
projectors of the enterprise state that they an
ticipate little difficulty in procuring a fran
chise and that they hope to get to work within
sixty days."
The San Bernardino Sun has again changed
hands. The new management will fight cor
ruption and jobbery and be loyal to all Re
publican principles. R. C. Harbison is the
editor and in his salutatory he declares that
the Sun not only believes in sound money, but
"in protection as the cardinal doctrine of the
party's faith, and in season and out of season
it will urge a return to the tariff legislation
which brought prosperity to the country â
East, West, North and Southâ which protected
American labor, and which for thirty years
not only provided the Government with reve
nue sufficient to carry on the work of its vari
ous departments, but during which period few
years passed in which the National debt was
not reduced."
The people of Livermore are jubilant over
the prospect of a new and adequate water
system, the supply being the natural artesian
wells known as Las Positas Springs. The
Livermore Herald thus speaks of the big
project :
"For several weeks past JohnAylward has
been exploring the fountains of Las Positas.
With the aid of a gang of workmen, a 20-horse
power engine and a big centrifugal pump he
has put a spring on the Livermore place, two
miles northeast of town, to the test and
proved its capacity to deliver GOO.OOO gallons
in twenty-four hours. This spring Is nothing
more nor less than a natural artesian well
flowing up through a bed of clay from an
immense gravel reservoir, probably the bed of
some prehistoric creek. Mr. Aylward has put
down a curbing fourteen feet, about five feet
square, and is about half way through the
gravel. There are two other springs near by,
and it is the purpose of Mr. Aylward and his
associates to develop them as well, and com
bine their flow. He is authority for the state
ment that this water proposition is a sure go â
that eight, seven and six inch pipe has already
been purchased and will soon be here to con
duct the water the two miles into town. This
plan involves the building of a storage reser
voir on tbe Sangmaster hill north of town.
The water will be pumped into this reservoir
from the natural flow of tbe spring?, and the
elevation will give a pressure of 100 feet upon
the mains, enough to give the town a splendid
defense against fire. The water from these
springs is cold, clear, pure and comparatively
soft.
"If Mr. Aylward and his people develop this
enterprise for all it Is worth, Ltvermore will
have boodles of water of the finest quality, for
all necessary purposes. Insurance would
thereby De reduced one-half, our streets and
outlying avenues could be sprinkled at a
nominal expense, ana our flower gardens
would never famish in the summer for the life
giving liquid. The water is at hand. The
only other requisite is pipe big enough and
strong enough te meet requirements."
The wonderful benefit to a locality of a beet
sngar factory is shown by tbe experience of
every section wherein such a factory has been
established; but the Chino Valley Champion
furnishes a few figures that may serve as an
eye-opener to parts of the State which may not
know that a sugar factory is almost synony
mous with a prosperous condition in its vicin
ity even during these close-money times:
"Chino ranch lands are rated high in value,
and properly so. Six years ago our soil was
not more valuable than that in many other,
though smaller, bodies of land in Southern
California, approximating it in fertility. The
change wrought has been a wonderful one
and explains the wide scale of land values iv
this valley. After Richard Gird acquired this
property he recognized the fact that if he
would enhance the value of the land he must
use some means to Increase the producing
power of the land or make a more available
and certain market for the soil products as
they were. To this problem he turned his at
tention, and finally decided that these ends
would be accomplished most successfully by
establishing the beet-sugar industry here. He
accordingly secured, by a large expenditure
on his part, the erection of the present sugar
factory. The result has fully justified the
means. Land that before was worth $40 an
acre is now worth $200 an acre. Good land
can be had, however, on tbÂ£ Chino ranch for
$100 per acre and less.
"This increased value Is brought about by
two mean?. In the first place the improved,
thorough and scientific culture which is given
the soil has increased its producing capacity
to a large extent. This is evidenced by the
fact that all the new land cropped to beets has
produced better the second year than the first,
and the third year than the second.
"The presence of the sugar factory, as a
matter of fact, provides unvarying, staole and
certain market for all that the land can pro
duce. No middleman eats up the profits; no
railroad taxes tbe farmer to carry his crop to
market and his price is guaranteed in advance.
These are factors which enhance the value of
land. They have enhanced the value of every
acre of land within ten miles of the Chino
sugar factory."

the smart men who contribute intellectual
capital toward the scheme of acquiring the
political orchard. F. P. Thompson, formerly

SOME PECULIAR METAPHORS.
A Few Elocutionary Gems From Mr.
Bryan's Friends.
Wash Ington Post.
Shooting the chute from the sublime to the
ridiculous is becoming frequent with Mr.
Bryan's friends. The "crown of thorns and
the cross of gold" business opens up great pos
sibilities in that direction. He was aileader of
the Populists of Missouri, who concluded an
impassioned speech in the Sedalia Convention
with :
"You shall not thrust the dagger of suspicion
through the intervals in this crown of thorns."
The orator was repelling the insinuation that
there was any danger of Tom Watson being
thrown by the Democrats in the proposed
fusion.
Mr. Bryan having set the pace, his emotional
followers are bound to indulge in fantastic
and sacrilegious use of biblical metaphors and
illustrations. It was at the Bedalia Convention
that delegates cried out, "Amen I" -'Amenl
to such declarations for political reform as ap
pealed especially to them. One orator, some
what mixed as to his biblical recollections,
shouted at the close of his thrilling peroration:
"I tell you, brethren, the golden calt must
come down off his roost."
Another, in placing his candidate before the
convention, said:
"Gentlemen, the man I am about to name
has withstood what is, in my opinion, the
strongest test of loyalty to Populism. You re
member the story of Job. You recall how he
was tried and tempted by the loss of friends
and of property. What was inflicted upon him
finally as the supreme test, as the straw which
was to break bis back ?"
"Boils," bawled a delegate in a rear seat.
"No, brother," said the speaker, "you're
wrong. It was when his wife turned against
him that Job was called upon to meet the
supreme test. Brethren, the candidate I am
about to offer you has met the test of Job. He
is a Populist, notwithstanding the opposition
of his wife. His name is Oscar Woods of
Chan ton."
BUT IT WILL COME.
New York Press.
Prosperity will come only with increased
business. Increased business will come only
with Increased revenue. Increased revenue
will come only with protection. Protection
will come only with Republicanism. Republi
canism will come only with McKinley.

In 1793 Congress provided that in such case
succession should pass next to the President
of the Senate and then to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives. This was of doubt
ful constitutionality and attended with some
inconvenience and danger. Hence Congress,
in 1886, provided that in case of the death, re
moval, etc., of the President and Vice-Presi
dent the succession should next pass to the
cabinet oflScers, in the following order, pro
vided the officer on whom It devolves has been

otherwise qualified to hold the office : Secre
tary of State, Treasury, War, Attorney-Gen
eral, Postmaster-General, Secretary of the
Navy and of the Interior. The officer thus
elected serves out the unexpired term.

ONE SURVIVOR ESCAPED
He Reached Circle City and Told
His Story to the Crew of
the Bertha.
DISGRUNTLED MINEES RETURN
They Say the Alaskan Gold Fields
Are a Failureâ Tronble at
Sunset City.
The rush from AlaÃka still continues.
By every Bteamer and sailing vessel that
leaves Cooks Inlet, Turnagain Arm or St.
Nicholas hundreds of the dupes who left
here three months ago are returning, sad
der but wiser men. In very few instances
has there been actual suffering, as every
body went equipped for at least a six
months' siege. In consequence provisions
sold for less than they cost in San Fran
cisco, because everybody who had a stock
on hand was anxious to sell out and reach
home as quickly as possible.
Among the arrivals from the exploited
gold fields Saturday was the Alaska Com
mercial Company's steamer .Bertha, the
overdue bark Theobald and the steamer
Umatilla. The latter is from Fuget Sound
ports only, but nevertheless she brought
down a number of disgruntled miners
who managed to reach Seattle by sailing
vessels. The brig Blakeley was five weeks
in getting to Tacoma and there she was
sold to pay the wages of her crew. Among
the Blafceley's passengers was J. J. Camp
bell, the popular purser of the Umatilla.
He made a trip to the so-called mines, but
was only too glad to get back on board his
old berth. *
. The bark Theobald was classed as over
due, but when Captain Swan got in he at
at once reported that he was only twenty
days out. He waited a fortnight for some
miners who wanted to come home, but as
they could not raise the money and had
plenty of provisions he had finally to up
anchor and leave.
"We made a quick run from San Fran
cisco to Coal Harbor," said Captain
Swan. "At that point there is the finest
coalbed in Alaska and we landed
about thirty miners to work it. On our
return they had mined out 800 tons of coal
and we brought it down. Judging by the
sample we have in the hold of the Theo
bald and judging from what I saw of the
placer mines, the Alaska coal mines will
pay 50 per cent better tnan its gold mines.
"From Coal Harbor we went to Ladd
station and there the miners were in a
state of insurrection. They said they had
been beguiled away from home and it
would have been a sorry hour for the men
who started tne rush Lad they put in an
appearance while we were there. Over
200 miners were camped at that point and
not one of them had earned his bread and
butter.
"After leaving Ladd station I took the
bark to Fire Island and chartered the
steamer Sealight to tow us to Sunrise
City. At tbat point everything was rush
ing. Hammers, planes, paws and chisel 3
were going from morning to night. Sa
loons, butcher- shops, grocery -stores,
gambling-dens and a brewery sprang up
as if by magic. Everybody had a few
dollars, but as there was nothing coming
in it was only a question of a few days
when all would be broke. I came to the
conclusion that the Alaska gold fields are
a good place to Keep away from. My men
thought differently, however, and in con
sequence 1 had to work the Theobald back
to Coal Bay witn only four men. There
we took on a load of coal and before I was
ready to sail there were enough sailors to
man a warship begging a passage.
"The placer mining in Alaska is a com
plete failure. It is just possible dur
ing this month that men who have
money and facilities behind them may
locate some rich quartz mines, but placer
mining will never pay. The Boston Gold
Mining Company, in which a number of
Oakland people are interested, is building a
ditch from Anchor Point River to the
Bluff. They have sixty men at work, and
when a flow of water is procured they will
start washing out the Bluff sand. The
venture may pay. but in any event it has
given work to over half a hundred men
who were glad of the chance of handling a
pick and shovel in order to keep warm."
Tne Bertha brought down over a hun
dred miners. Among them was one or
two who had been years in Alaska and
these had considerable money with them.
The vessel's cargo consists of 1507 seal
skins, 34 bear skins, 170 otter skins, 1585
fox skins, 27 packages curios, 11 boxes of
amalgam and some whalebone. The rev
enue cutter Bear was spoken at St.
Michaeis on July 23 and Captain Tuttle
reported that he could not get through to
the relief stations on account of the ice.
The spring catch of the vessels whicn
wintered at Herschell Island was given as
two whales.
Omar Maris, special correspondent of
the Chicago Record, was one of the pas
sengers on the Bertha. He is at the Grand.
He tells a story of dissatisfaction among
the whalers that resulted in bloodshed.
He got the information from a deserter,
who reached Circle City after being three
months on his journey from Herschel
Island, the winter quarters of whaling
vessels.
On January 19. 1896, seven men de
serted. Five, owing to the frozen con
dition of two, were taken back to the ves
sels. The two other men kept on. One
reached Circle City after traveling for
seventy-two days with a party of Indians
he fell in with. The other made for the
post on the Yukon and has not been re
ported on. On March 16 a party of twelve
deserted the ships at anchor. They, too,
went to the Lawrence River as did the
others. On the 19th they were overhauled
by ship's officers.
Shots were exchanged, but no one was
wounded. The officers then apparently
desisted. On the 22d, however, they came
up again, come 120 miles further on, and a
fight ensued. One deserter was killed, one
wounded and six were captured. One
officer was killed. Five deserters got away
safely. These returned later to the spot
and found a body, supposed to be tnat of
Fitzgerald of the Joannette, but the
features were disfigured. Later one of the
five, John Burke of San Francisco., and
of the Belooga, was frozen to death. The
men deserted because of general dissatis
faction.
Many of the vessels now off Herschell
Island have been there three years and if
the ice has not broken up they will be
there another twelve months. This will
probably be their fate, because if the Bear
could not reach Point Barrow last July
there is no chance of the whalers getting
out later on;

THE HIBERNIA BANE.
The Bank Commission Files a Report
in Answer to a Complaint Against
That Institution.
The following report anent the Hibernia
Bank has been issued by the Bank Com
missioners:
I.
As to the charge that the bank donated
$50,000 to the Valley road, the bank claims
the right to make such an investment out ot
its reserve fund by virtue of the statute of this
State under which it is incorporatedâ act
passed 1862, and amended 1864. Said dona
tion by the bank was a legitimate business
precaution made for the purpose of strength
ening its mortgaged interests, and lor the ben
efit of the depositors.
11.
In reply to the charge that the bank has
exceeded the amount siet. by law to be invested
in the lot and premises in which it transacts
its business, the bank declares said amount
was invested under and by virtue of an act of
the Legislature of this State approved March
5, 1889, which act removed entirely the lim
itation that had previously existed as to the
value of the lot and building in which a cor
poration might transact its business.
111.
As to the charge that the bank has exceeded
the amount set by law that it may loan on
real estate (namely, 60 per cent of the market
value), the corporation denies that it is guilty
of such violation. Oi the two loans referred
to, in the Heyman mortgage the bank granted
a loan of $20,000 on a valuation of $42,000,
and part of the security has since been sold on
a basis of more than $50,000; in the Code
mortgage of $25,000 the loan was granted on a
valuation made at the time of loan of $45,000,
and for which lot owner subsequently refused
$60,000.
IV.
The charge that excessive salaries and fees
are paid the directors is not sustained; said
fees and salaries are no more than those usu
ally allowed in financial institutions where
the directors and officers hold positions of such
great trust and magnitude.
V.
The balance of the charge seeming to be
only the result of personal grievances on the
part of those complaining, and In part treat
ing of matter not in the jurisdiction of the
commission, does not come within the prov
ince of the commission.
The commission will add that, in their opin
ion, the affairs of the Hiberuia Savings and
Loan Society are conducted in an honest,
businesslike manner, and its finances regu
lated by au economic and praiseworthy sys
tem.
The commission also finds that. In their opin
ion, all the charges made in said complaint
against the Uibernia Savings and Loan So
ciety are entirely unfounded

P. B. CORNWALL IS HERE
He Says He Did Not Leave Town
to Avoid Being Called as
a Witness.
Having Returned From a Busine:
Trip He Is Ready to Appear Before
the Grand Jury if Wanted.
P. B. Cornwall, president of the Electric
Lieht Company, who is wanted to give
testimony before the Grand Jury in the
matter of the seven Supervisors who are
under a cloud, returned to this City from
his northern trip yesterday.
When seen at his home, corner of Page
and Buchanan streets, last evening Mr.
Cornwall said:
"I have just returned from a long jour
ney and am quite fatigued. As to being
wanted as a witness before the Grand
Jury, my first knowledge of that was
when I was in Whatcom a newspaper cor
respondent called upon me and informed
me that a subpena had been issued for me.
"I told him that I had no knowledge of
the matter, but that as soon as I had
transacted my business I would return to
San Francisco and be ready to answer any
lawful summons.
"I have returned, and if any Grand Jary
or court needs ray presence I shall answer
any lawful summons. For what purpose
I may be called before the Grand Jury I
do not know, and if I did I could not tell
you nor any one else what my testimony
would be. That is for the grand jurors.
"I had no Knowledge when I left here
that I would be needed as a witness, and
did not leave to avoid the service of a sub
pena. It has been my habit for a number
of years to make six trips a year to the
State of Washington on business which
requires my attention, and the trip I made
was one of these."
When informed that Mr. Summerhayes
had stated that Mr. Cornwall could tell
considerable about street-lighting, Mr.
Cornwall smiled and said: "He did, did
her Well, that reminds me of the story
of the monkey and the parrot. After an
encounter the parrot returned to his
perch and, discovering that he had not a
feather left, remarked mournfully: 'I
guess I've talked too much' ; but seriously,
if I am wanted as a witness I am ready to
answer to any lawful summons that may
be served on me."
HE WILL PLEAD GUILTY.
Neagle Will Protect the Southern
Pacific From Unpleasant
Inquiries.
Dave Neagle, the Southern Pacific gun
man from Arizona, will protect the South
ern Pacific Company by pleading guilty to
that assault on A. .1. Collins. He will pay
over into the police court next Wednesday
the comparatively small fine the court will
impose, and by doing so will draw a heavy
four-ply curtain between the Southern
Pacific Company and the public.
It is known that this will be the course
of the Collins case, which would be so
fruitful of interest and information if it
ever came to trial on its merits.
When the case wascalled in Judge Low's
court Saturday Dave Neagle appeared
alone as both defendant and his own at
torney. It was true that Mr. Kelly and
some other Southern Pacific attorneys
were present, together with a number of
Southern Pacific detectives, but Mr. Neagle
rose for himself, displayed an acquaintance
with the law in the case and secured a
postponement without pleading and with
out demanding or waiving a jury trial.
He secured the continuance and the pro
ceedings end6d.
Low Prices for Shoes.
This is an era of low prices in various
lines of wearing apparel, but of all the at
tractive inducements to buyers in the mat
ter of prices, the clearance sale now in
progress at Kast's shoe store is the great
est. These summer clearance sales are
regular aunual events at this house, and
the occasions are always memorable to
those who patronize them, because of the
remarkable values that are offered. This
year's sale eclipses all otners, and such an
opportunity to buy footwear at cost, and
less than cost, will not occur again in this
city until next year's sale at Kast's. Every
shoe in the house is marked down for this
sale. The stock is all new, stylish and up
to-date in every respect, while for finish
and durability Kast's shoes .have no supe
rior. The sale will continue for this week
only, ana those who wish to take advan
tage of it should visit the store without
delay.
Died in the Receiving Hospital.
James O'Grady, who was found at Powell
and Market streets on Saturday evening suffer
ing: from an unknown cause and who was re
moved to the Receiving Hospital In the patrol
wagon, died yesterday morning from epilepsy.
The deceased was a native of Ireland aged 57
years, and had resided at 863% Market street.
The body was taken to the Morgue.

ELDER SNOW IN TOWN.

Completion.
A CONVERT AT TWENTY-THREE
The Aged Latter-Day Saint Says the
Local Church Is in. a Flour
ishing Condition.
"A man gets tired of work every now
and then, and needs a little spin for a
change."
The handsome, courtly speaker was a
Elder Lorenzo Snow, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the
Church of Jesus ChiÂ«Â«t of Latter- Day Saints.
man apparently about 60 years of age, and
the place a cozy suite in the Hotel Lap
ham. But Eider Lorenzo Snow, whose
lull title is president, of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is an
old, old man. Though he looks to be
only a decade over 50 years old, that
figure exactly represents the duration of
his ministry in the Mormon church.
Sixty years ago, one bright Sunday in
the summer of 1836, a young man of 23
years first listened to the teaching of the
Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith. The
new doctrine impressed him deeply, and
for a short space he studied it with care
and in connection with extensive Scriptu
ral research.
At length, convinced that Mormonism
was the only true religion, he was received
into that church and shortly afterward
ordained to its ministry.
"I have followed the destinies of Mor
monism for over half a century," contin
ued Elder Snow, "and I find it flourish
ing and prosperous. To be loved it must
be known and understood; that is all.
But I am so accustomed to preaching that
I fear that lam dropping into it now. In
my ministerial life I have preached
everywhere I could find an audience. Ever
since the completion of the magnificent
temple at Bait Lake City, I have minis
tered there, a space of three years.
"My coming here is not in the nature
of an official visit. I am merely taking
advantage of a chance to visit my son in
this City and my brother in San Buena
ventura."
Elder Snow carries his 83 years very
easily. He walks with a cane, or, more
properly speaking, swings a cane in his
hand when he walks, but even that was
not taken up until he had completed four
score of years. He is of medium height,
rather slight in build, and his hair and
full beard are slightly streaked with white.
He is said to have been successful in his
early business enterprises, and to be n w
a man of independent fortune. His presi
dency over the Twelve Apostles is rather
of honor than of jurisdiction, there being
also a patriarch and a general Bishop,
both like himself suDject to the president
of the Mormon church.
THE THEATERS.
A lilat of the Yi.riou* Attraction* That
Have Been Selected to Entertain
l'alrons 10-Night.
The attraction that is to be offered at
the Baldwin Theater this evening is "The
Masqueraders." a drama by Henry Arihur
Jones, a well-known dramatist. It is rep
resented as a play of intense interest with
many thrilling scenes whioh will be ae
picted by the Empire Company.
At the California Theater Chauncey
Olcott, whose sweet voice during the past
week captivated so many, will this even
ing present to the audience his persona
tion of the leading role in "The Irish
Artist," 8 play that is out of the usual run
of Irish presentations, but very interesting.
A play with a cofnprehensive and ex
ceedingly interesting plot is what is to be
offered to the patrons of the Columbia
Theater this evening. It is "The Great
Unknown," in which Wilton Lackaye and
Mrs. ThorndyKe Boucicault will appear in
the principal characters.
At the Grand Opera-house will be pre
sented this evening the "Two Orphans,"
put on as it never before has been put on
a stage in this City. James M. Brophy
will appear in the cast, and Professor
Greber's Mandolin and Guitar Club will,
in the Garden of Bel Air, render 6oft
music.
There will be grand opera at the Tivoli
this evening. The selection is "The Hu
guenots." The management annouuees
that it will be put on with as much care
and attention to details as when presented
by high-priced theaters. Mme. Natali
will appear as Valentine.
There is a wonderful attraction at the
Orpheum music-hall this evening. It is
the "king laughmaker," T. A. Kennedy.
He is not only a laughmaker but he is a
hypnotist and mesmerist whose perform
ances are extraordinary. There will be in
addition the usual number of specialties.
The attractions at the Chutes this even
ing will consist of a vaudeville in the
Casino, where specialty artists will render
interesting numoers. Shooting the chutes,
tripping the trolley, riding in the scenic
railway, the haunted swing and the merry
go-round will all be in operation.
MUST SHOW THE BOOKS.
The Cold Storage Company's Accounts
Will Be Examined in the Corrl
veau Case.
Henry W. Westphal, secretary, and
William Mersfelder, assistant secretary of
the Merchandise and Cold Storage Com
pany, appeared in Judge Coffey 'a court
Saturday in answer to a citation to show
cause why they should not be punished
for contempt In refusing to comply with
an order of the court to produce the books
of the company in court.
The corporation officers were represented
by M. A. Dorn and C. E. Nougues, and
Crittenden Thornton and L. M. Hoefler
represented the estate of Louis Corriveau.
Westpbal and Mersfelder were needed
to cast some light on alleged transactions
between Corriveau and the company
wherein Corriveau'9 estate melted away
The books, it was contended by the
estate, would ahow all these things.
The company's attorneys heia that the
oliicers of the corporation had no right to
remove the books from the company's
office, but they were willing to allow the
executor to examine the books in the
office.
Thornton contended that contempt of
court was committed in refusing to pro
duce the books in court. This point was
argued at length by both sides, and the
court overruled the demuurrer.
Westpbal was called to the witness
stand and he testified that he had been
secretary of the company since its organi
zation in January, 1893. He was telling
what he knew about the books, when bis
attorney, M. A. i)orn, cut the examina
tion short by offering to have the books in
court. This morning at 9 o'clock was
selected as the time for presenting the ex
amination before Judgi* Coffey.

CAMPBELL'S ABDUCTION.
Mrs. 0. W. Winthrop Makes a
Statement Defending Her
Husband.
SHE SATS HE IS INNOCENT.
Some Strange Portions of the Sensa
tional Kidnaping Story Are
Pointed Oat.
The stranee adventures of James A.
Campbell, the millionaire of Hawaii, as
related by himself, continue to be a fruit
ful topic without the slightest ray of light
being thrown on it by the army of detec
tives who are supposed to be diligently
working on the case.
Captain Lees cannot speak too highly of
the bravery and grit of the old planter,
and no matter how weak the points show
up in Campbell's story, the captain insists
they are strong and conclusive as corrob
orative of the story the old man tells.
When Captain Lees first heard from
Private Detective Curtin that the Hawaiian
was missing and that foul play was sus
pected, the two Hawkshaws traced the
missing man up to Monday afternoon last.
He was seen then with O. W. Winthrop, a
man whom Captain Lees does not hesitate
to say is the murderer of Mrs. Jennie
Matthews.
Even in the face of this the detectives
did not take Winthrop into custody, al
though they say they could have done so.
They say tnat they made no arrest because
they feared action of that kind would
jeopardize Campbell's safety.
Two days later, on Wednesday niarht
last, Mr. Campbell, broken down in health,
bruised and bleeding, reappeared at
the Occidental Hotel, whence he was
taken by Winthrop. The latter called in
the detectives, told them his sensational
story about being kidnaped, and then the
sleuths thought it about time to seek for
Winthrop and his alleged accomplice. By
that time, however, both men were under
cover and have not since been seen.
Mrs. Winthrop, wife of the suspected
man, and two reputable ladies in ihe
bouse in which she lives at 354 Grove
street, are positive that Campbell, Lees
and Curtin are all wrong about Wintbrop
being the man who lured Campbell away
from the Occidental Hotel on Monday
afternoon. They declare positively that
he was at his home for his evening meal
about 6 o'clock that evening. If this be
the truth Winthrop could not possibly
have been at 4109 California street, where
Campbell says he was.
Mrs. Winthrop when seen yesterday
was averse to conversing on the subject of
her husband's disappearance.
"That," the lady said, "is the one par
ticular point on which the detectives lay
the greatest stress. They seem to accept
the fact that he is not within their
clutches as proof positive he is guilty.
"Once before he was made to suffer tem
porary imprisonment on a charge of mur
der which was perfectly groundless, and
he does not propose to undergo the same
ordeal in this case, which is equally with
out foundation. When the proper time
comes Mr. Winthrop will be ready and
willing, as he is now, to face his accusers
and prove his innocence."
In the meantime Captain Lees has a
regular relay watch on guard at the Win
throp house. Mrs. Winthrop, as she
glances up and down the street, shrugs
her shoulders and says:
"There they are; why don't they spend
their time trying to unravel the motive of
Mr. Campbell's wild story, instead of
making things so disagreeable for me?"
It is pointed out by the theorists who
disbelieve Mr. Campbell's tale of kidnap
ing that the alleged bullet hole in the wall
of the house 4109 California street is not
genuine. There is next to no indentation

This, they say, could have been done with
the ferrulfr of a cane.
Then, again, it is put forth, why did not
such a "game and gritty" man as Camp
bell is said to be by Captain Lees, make a
battle or an outcry when he was being
escorted to the car Wednesday night by
the smaller man ot the two alleged kid
napers ?
It is contended that such an outcry or
battle would have been in natural keeping
with the desperate and resolute stand
Campbell says he made when bound and
gagged by the villains.
Mrs. Campbell escaped the interroga
tories of the newspaper men by spending
the day at Golden Gate Park.

Perjury.
LOCAL POLITICAL COHTRAST.
Republicans and Pcpulists March and
Ta;k. but Create Different
Impressions.
CAKLASi>OmcKSAS Frascisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Aug. 9. f
Eveu in the days when rabid reform
movements have forced that element in
politics known as "the pull" or "the
pash" to hide its head, no one in Aiameda
County has ever boasted that "the ma
chine" was dead. Whenever an official
displeased any sect he was at once de
clared to be a handie or Â» crank or come
other part of the abstract political ma
chine. The machine politicians in Oak
land have done pretty much as they
pleased for maoy years, but the machine
thai has developed during the past week
possesses more ability to do harm, to
make false charges and to shield guilty
persons than tne old-time political organi
zations ever dared to attempt in their
most arrogant days.
There is no doubt that the new machine
is warmly welcomed by a select few, but
its actions are highly unsatisfactory to the
rest of the county. By the representa
tions of the new machine indictments
have been issued by Grand Juries and
withdrawn, and when any money disap
pears from the county funds it will be im
7C?s:ble t j trace the responsibility for tbe
theft so long as the new machine can be
depended upon to slip a cog or two and
baffle justice.
About a year ago it was discovered that
some money had been stolen from the
county. The Auditor was indicted nine
I by the Grand Jury on various
charges and after several farce-comedies
in court and the rehearsal of a few acts
before another Grand Jury it was given
out that the Tax-Collector was tbe man
under suspicion. He did not rest easy
under the imputation and was threaten
ing all kinds of revelations wben another
discovery was made. He was not guilty
at all ; the shortage attributed to him did
not exist and the whole trouble was caused
by a little mechanical device that was
used in adding n^ures. One of the wheels
had gone a cog too fast and had added a
comfortable sum to the total that it should
sot hare done.
As the proceedings of the Grand Jury
room are private it is not known by what
manner of legal advice the jurors have
been misguided, but enough money has
been spent in experting to have discovered
the guilty parties twenty times over. The
next proceeding, if the farce ia to be kept
up on the same lines as have been fol
lowed for ihe past year, would be to advise
the Grand Jury to indict the mechanical
adding machine for perjury. Such a
coarse would be a mild surprise to the
great uninitiated compare! with other
events in tbis majestic farce.
Short as has been tbe time since Bryan
waa nominated, there is a marked
diminution in the size of his boom in Aia
meda County. There were far more
people arguing daily around tbe bulletin
boards two weeks ago than were in last
night's parade. The two demonstrations
last night were an object lesson. The Re
publicans and Populists turned oat, and
each ratified its respective National plat
form. Tbe Populists looked well and held
a well-attended meeting. But there was
one thing noticeable about their speeches.
They were smart enough, but they
sounded like the bleatings of sheep hunt
ing a sbephercL They acknowledged their
need of something that would bring about
a renewal of prosperous times, but their
banner is nothing but a hope. Sheriff C.
B. White, aa earnest speaker and one to
whom it is a pleasure for any intelligent
man to listen, could not alter the tone of
tbe meeting hard as he strove to. His
best and promising periods were but
hopes. Let's make a change and trust to
chance for the rest seemed to be the
utmost that could be said for the princi
â¢ bat were advocated.
Vastly different was tbe appearance of
that Republican body and the ring of its
speeches. With them hope had long since
fied and they marched and acted like men
progressing toward a certainty. The long
line of veterans in tbe Army and Navy
League did not swing their feet as though
they were following a blind hope. They
ot need a transparency or a oanner,
the sight of them was enough. Tbe same
is true of the younjrer element, the Alii
ance. Confidence and certainty were por
trayed in their demeanor.
The City Hall politicians are already
laying tfceir wires and building their
fences fox tbe campaign next spring. The
tax levy will be decided next year purely
M rezard; ita value as a prestige-making
element. Last year the tight over the levy
waa between tbe Mayor and the council.
Tbis year it will be between the taxpayers
who want a tax levy and the non-taxpayers
who want to work for the City and would
like tbe officials to have as much aa pos
sible to spend. Whicbevereiement controls
tbe most votes will guide the levy-rrakers.
The absura controversy now being car
ried on regarding the Police and Fire
departments not being in polities would
r ever have been started had Commissioner
Wilson as mach experience In politics as
Le >Â»" in engineering. It would be inter
esting to know when either department
has been out of politics. This does not
mean that every patrolman is a "worker,"
but it toes mean that all the changes are
dominated by politics and that merit is
totally disregarded. S, W. B.

Rev. James Small of the First Christian j

man i may violate J for i years \ the? law of right \
and truth and duty, and J then through prayer
sadden iy nave his guilt transferred to another
and his soul be a* 11 he had neÂ«er sinned. It
Is taught that Jesus died in onr room and

Eternal death. â¢ Weil, did ? Jesus suffer eternal

morse of conscience t^^^m^msmm^M
&*A% third misconception of prayer is that by
virtue of it God can and will work a miracle of f
healing on my body. The rift of >; healing was i
in the primitive church, but it has cot come 'â 
down to us. They were needed then to prove â¢
the I truth I and I divinity of ; the it message ; and
messages, but Â» they : an -. cos i needed 'â  to-day. I
Love and faith and hope are more needed in
the world to-day than miracles.

BERKELEY. Cal, Aug. 9.âJL dish
wasber bearing the surname Louis, in the
employ of the California Hotel, was found

dences of having committed suicide. He

he was joking, or trying to scare them, be
cause no one could be found who had sold
him any of the drug. He had been drink
ing heavily all day previously. Very lit
tle is known of tbe man's history or bis
previous business associations, but he was
said to have a friend m Ban Francisco by
the name of Thomas Faulkner. A partial
autopsy was held this evening with the
hone of definitely determining whether he
committed suicide.

CRICKET ACROSS THE BAY
\ The Pacifies Were ] Badly > De
feated by the Bohemian ;
Eleven.
And the Alameda Team Just Walked
Aw With the California
Combination. . ' . .
The regular cup cricket matches played
yesterday were deplorably â  one-sided. At
Golden ~l Gate '% close contest *' was ex
pected, for the competing { teamsâ the Bo
hemians ; and â¢; Pacifics â are considered to
be "much of ; a ; muchness" jin .point of
strength. r But ; these expectations | were
anything" but realized, for the Bohemians
walked all over" their opponents. â¢ . r ; . ;
; ! The Bohemians won ) the^ toss and J sent
the ? Pacifies I in. At the fall: of tbe first |
wicket Richardson went in and played an
admirable . inning of 33 not out. Except
ing Severs, not another man ' could do a
thing against the wicked breakers of Cook- ;
son and Robertson, and the i side was dis- ;
missed for 73 runs. The result then was
almost a foregone conclusion, v i^^v;
; W Headed ' by Bowhili and Martin, the Bo
! hemians started to bat. After two wickets
i had fallen and a score of runs were put up,
! Robertson went in. He knocked together
j 132, ginne two chances, J but otherwise
1 piayine a consummate game. Reeves and
Reynolds also did good i work, and "ex
tras" assisted considerably - toward the
totalâ runs. This gave them the game
Iby 171. The scores :

WHY THE ORDER
IS LEGITIMATE.
Rev. W. T. Fieenor Speaks
of the American Protec
tive Association.
ONLY AMERICAN ORDER
The Speaker Declares the Associa
tion Has a God-Given Power to
Oppose Foreign Influence.
ECME THE ENEMY OF LIGHT.
Ignorance and Superstition Declared
to Be the Results of Papal
Influence.
The inducements which yesterday of
fered for an outing interfered somewhat
with the attendance at the Good Citizen
ship meeting in Metropolitan Hall in the
afternoon. President Quitzow congratu
lated thoae present upon the fealty to
patriotic principles which their presence
evinced, and declared that no matter how
small the attendance might be or what
might be said on tbe outside the meetings
would continue until time without end.
Rev. W. T. Fieenor of Seattle was the
speaker of the afternoon. His topic was
"Ia tbe American Protective Association
a Legitimate Institution ?"
He said that in Seattle all the people
who did not already oelong to the A. P. A.
were on the way to ft, and tbe order ai
ready controlled tbe city government.
The address was confined to the propo
sitions: "Is the American Protective Asso
ciation a legitimate institution?" "Has it
a right to live?" "Have we a right to
support it?"
The speaker declared that the American
Protective Association was a necessity to
tbe American people, and a necessity
needed no apology. "Americanism will
not slumber," ha declared, "while the
threatening yokes and chains of foreign
despotism are at its gates. Where is the
answer to the threatening of this country?
Yonder it rises, and declares that it will
rule this country. Papism is ita name,
imperialism its character and despotism
its object. Why organize against this
power? Because it is the only ecclesias
ticism sworn against this nation. Roman
ism is tbe one mighty power which, hav
ii.z cursed the nations of Europe, holds its
iron threateningly over this country.
"The question arises, Has Rome a
scheme, a policy in this country? Has
she had a policy in other countries? Pius
claims that no man has a right to thine
unies3 he thinks in harmony with the
minds that rule the church.
"Cardinal Manning, speaking for tbe
Pope, says, 'I acknowledge no civil power.
lam the dictator of an men.' Every true
American says, ' Sever! Not dictator of
me.' Tbe Catholic Review said, 'The
Catholics will gain possession of the United
States.' The Pope has said, 'I am no
where so much Pone aa in the United
States.'
â Has the A. P. A. a right to lire? Thou
sands and thousands question it. Has it
a right to tbe respect of the American
people? Our constitution guarantees to
every American people tbe right to life,
liberty and free speech. Does not free
speech imply constitutional liberty? I
believe in liberty circumscribed by the
honor of oar fl ig and tbe honor of our
country. There is a corrupt stream of for
eign population ponring in here that is
non-assimiiative. We have a rigbtto reg
ulate this, and the A. P. A. is the only
God-e-ven power among societies to regu
late this.
"II Romanism cannot be made to sab
serve the ends of this country then Roman
ism must go. The only trouble with this
country is she has been dragged icto the
mud puddle. Last year 50 per cent of the
crime in Massachusetts was committed
by these ncn- Americans though they are
only 7 per cent of the population of tbe
State. In the face of this I ask hasn't the
A. P. A. a right to rule to-day ?
New York City is ruled by Rome to-day.
Tammany Hall is a Jesuit headquarters.
Brooklyn is ruled by priests. Rome rules
twenty of the large cities of this country
to-day. Ever bill presented to tbe lower
bouse goes under tbe eves of Bishops and
Cardinals. Tbey talk of tariff. If II had
my way I'd pile up tariff upon this foreign
scum as heavy as the law of gravity.
"The American Protective Association
is the only organisation that is purely for
America and American principles. Tbis
order stands for intelligence. Light is tbe
life of Government. Rome is the ally of
ignorance and of superstition. She dreads
nothing so much as she does tbe light.
Why screen ail the American saloons?
Why clothe all her rituals in mystery?
Rome has ruled Mexico for three hundred
years, and there they sell potatoes for 1
cent apiece and you nave to buy them one
at a time, because the seller can't count.
And Home wants to take our children to
educate.
"Bishop Purcell says that no man has a
right to choose his own religion, and it is
oniy a question of time ween Rome will
obtain possession of this country and
every man will have to worship according
to tbe dictates nf tbe papal see.
"The American Protective Association
stands for liberty of conscience. These
Papalites stand together; tbey vote to
gether; they get drunk together, and the y
curse this conntry together.
"Old Pope Pins is clamoring fora crown.
He says, 'I want to rule. I want the domi
nation of the nations of the earth.' If I
bad my way I'd place him on the crater of
old Vesuvius and let the bowels of the
earth take him skyward in a chariot of fire.
Then, if God would do anything for him,
the American people would be glad."

THE CULL'S OUTING CLUB
A Pleasant Sunday Spent on the
Wreck of the Steamer
Capital
Jolly Times Diving and Swimming
and a Big Catch of
Fish.
Tbe most fashionable way to spend a
Sunday of the declining days of summer
is to go to the abandoned wreck of the old
steamer Capital on the eastern shore of
Marin County. To be sure the fashion
has only started, but that makes no differ

liquid refreshment was required when tbey
got there. ' But that only added zest to
the sport of fishing, and in some ca*Â»s
doubled the catch.
When the fish were divided up it was
found that each man had more than he
could carry and really enough to supply
all the neighbors at home. The exact
Dumber caught was not counted, but it
would certainly take four figcres to ex
press it. The afternoon was spent in dil
ferent sports, snet as swimming and div
ing, while the quartet of the party fur
nished music.
Wben the hour for departure had come
there was trouble because the sea had be
come co rough the sma.il rowboats threat
ened to be swamped when the crowd got
aboard. Eo two of the most daring mem
bers of the party were dispatched to El
Campo for a steam lannch.
The steam launch arrived all right, and
the entire party reached El Campo in time
to catch the last boat home. But wben
the big ferry pulled away from tne wharf
a horrible discovery was made. They
had come away and forgotten all the fish.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
An Improved Demand Reported
for Country Proper
ties.
THE MORTGAGE TAX LAW.
A Constitutional Amendment for Its
Repeal to Be Voted on
This Fall.
There Us no change to note In the condition
of the City real estate market. There is a fair
demand for small properties and a number of
sales are being made. But for large properties
there is little or no inquiry.
In contrast to the light demand for City real
estate is the marked improvement noticed the
past few weeks in the demand for country
lands. All offices who conduct special depart
ments for the handling of country properties
report a better demand for country lands than
they have experienced lor six months past.
The main inquiry is for properties located in
the bay counties, although San Joaqnln Valley
is just now in good favor with buyersdue.it
iÂ£ said, to the construction of the railroad
through that section.
One encouraging feature in connection with
this improved demand for country real estate
is that a goodly percentage of the demand
seems to be from strangers who are desirous of
locating in the State. Occasionally an in teni
ing purc"haÂ«er is found who wants a tract of
ji-om 500 to 1500 acres, but the bulk of the
demand is for tracts of ten, twenty and up as
high as fifty acres.
Country homes, while not highly regarded
by many dwellers in cities, offer many advan
tages that should commend this class of in
vestments to those possessed of moderate
means and who are seeking a channel for the
investment of their money that will insure an
income sufficient for a livelihood. Conducting
a small farm of ten or more acres so that it
will prove a profitable venture is, like any
other successful business enterprise, a matter
of good judgment, skill and industry.
Many people living in cities where they own
â mall homes, yet where the competition in va
rious lines of industry is so keen as to make
life but little more than a struggle for exist
ence, could, if they exchanged their city
homes for a ten or twenty acre place in the
country, be able to live a much pleasanter life.
In aull, depressed times like these they would
not be compelled to undergo the worry and
anxiety that they have to in the city.
On a place of this kind, if properly managed,
it is possible to raise the bulk of what is con
sumed by the family, and the surplus can be
marketed", even in dull times like these, for
sufficient to more than defray all other ex
penses. Taxes in the country are also lower,
while the free, out-of-door life is such a pow
erful aid to good health that doctors' bills are
few and far between.
This roseate picture of country life, which a
dealer drew while discussing the increased de
mand for country lands, some may think an
exaggeration, but he said that doubters should
make a tour of the favored valleys of Califor
nia, particularly in the bay counties, where
thousands of examples could be found that
-would more than confirm all that he claimed
Teparding the advantages of small country
homes. In pursuing the business of farming
or fruit growing, whether on a small or large
scale, the question of success is, the gentleman
said, the same as that which attends the suc
cess of any business enterprise, be it a small
candy-store or a mammoth wholesale and
jobbing-bouse. It is a matter of good judg
ment and industry, coupled with the applica
tion of common-sense business principles.
THE MORTGAGE TAX LAW.
At the November election six constitutional
amendments are to be voted upon, one of
which will doubtless have some effect upon
the development of the State. The amend
ment in question is one that repeals the pres
ent mortgage tax law. It is as follows:
(Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 53.)
ABTICâK XIII.
Section 1. All property in the State not exempt
under the laws of the United States, or this
constitution, shall be taxed In proportion to its
value, to be ascertained as provided by law. The
word "property," as used in this article and sec
tion, is Hereby declared to Include moneys,
credits, bonds, stocks, dues, franchises, and all
other matters and things, real, personal and
mixed, capable of private ownership: provided,
that property ns-d for free public libraries and
free public museums, growing crops, mortgages,
trust deeds, property used exclusively for public
schools, and such as may belong to the United
States, this State, or to any county or municipal
corporation witbin this State, shall be exempt
from taxation. The Legislature may provide for
a reduction from credits of debts due bona fide
residents of this State.
sec- 2. Section 4of article XIII of this consti
tution is hereby repealed.
Sec. 3. Section sof article XIII of this consti
tution is hereby repealed.
There seems to be a diversion of opinion
among real-estate men as to the effect of the
passage of this amendment. The majority
fceem to be of the opinion that its passage will
prove of advantage to the State for the reason
that the removal of the mortgage tax will in
duce outside capital to come into the State ana
aid in its development. It is contended that this
tax is at present a barrier to the investment of
a great deal of money in California. On the
other hand, those who oppose the amendment
claim that if the mortgage-tax law is repealed
it will result in throwing upon real estate that
portion of the taxes that is now raised by tax
ing mortgage. In the majority of country
loans ana in many city loans it is usually stip
ulated or arranged so that the borrower pays
the mortgage tux, and in such case borrowers
would neither gain nor lose by its repeal.
The subject is one oi considerable import
ance and is one that has in other States at
various times given rise to many heated cam
paigns for and against the enactment or repeal
of such a law. It is a anestion that merits
much more discussion and attention than it Is
liable to receive, for the Presidential election
is of such importance that all other questions
or issues bid fair to be overlooked or given but
passing attention. -

Bovee, Toy & Sonntag have just placed upon
the market the famous Hale ranch at Mountain
View. It is one of the best known and most
desirable properties in the Santa Clara Vailey,
and as it will be offered in small tracts of ten
acres aud upward it will not at the present
rate of inquiry be very long before the entire
tract, comprising upward of 800 acres is dis
posed of. Last week the firm sold 46 acres
partially improved for $9500, while negotia
tions are well advanced for the salu of a num
ber of other parcels in the tract. The prices of
the property range from $40 to $100 per acre.
The same firm has handled the McMahan
ranch very successfully, having disposed of
nearly two-thirds of the 4000 acres in that
tract since it was placed in their hands not
many months ago. This land is located in
Northern Soiano County and comprises some
of the choicest in that favored section of the
State. It is being offered in small tracts at
$67 50 per acre.
KELLY BADLY TREATED,
Oakland Ballplayers Bunch Hits
on the Imperial
Pitcher. -
Very Close Contest for Seven Innings
and Then an Awfnl Can*
nonade.
The game between the Oaklandsand the
Imperials ;< played at the Folsom-street
grounds yesterday, afternoon was for sever*
innings : a close < and exciting contest. It
looked to be fa matter of fortune â¢as to
which would win. â : In the eighth inning,
however, \ the Oaklands unmasked a bat
tery of : safe hits and when , the ', smoke
cleared away it was found -that six singles
and a double - had been touched off and
seven men had circled ; the bases. . ;
, The game throughout was characterized
by heavy hitting. Two â  ; triples, two
doubles and nineteen singles were re
corded during : its - progress. '.* : Shea, X the
Oakland twirler, secured r three safe ones
out of four times at bat and was somewhat
more I effective iat i critical \ periods 1 than
Kelly. The latter is . ordinarily . a heavy
batter, but yesterday he failed '-. to ; once
find the ball. . - ' " Â
Neither side scored in the initial inning,
but in" the second the OaklandÃ V got ; two
men across the rubber on two safe nits and
two errors of their ; opponents. This per
formance they repeated in the third, in
the latter half of which inning the Im
perials scored two tallies on two safe hits
and a base on balls. '''â  â -. â ".'; â 'â â  'â 'â â  : ;'.-c ; - â 'â '-
â -' In the \ fourth \ the " visitors ; again : com
bined a couple of ,: hits '; with an error by
Smith, the ; result being ' another brace of
runs. / The Imperials ,in i their ; half went
them one better,- scoring three on two sin
gles, a double and four bad balls." 7; â¢ ;'
-..â ; The Oaklands added one to their collec
tion in the fifth and the Imperials gained
a point in the seventh, the score at the be
ginning of the eighth inning being 7 to 6
in : favor of the Â» visitors. ;; Then -y Pitcher
Kelly faced the ; terrific cannonading al
ready mentioned. - V :' ' ; .'
With what seemed a hopeless game on
their hands, t the Imperials Â»*â  started x - in
bravely in the last halt of the ninth. Mc-
Carthy got s bis J base \on X balls. pj Smith,
Bliss, Creamer and j Beckett followed with
singles and, with no one out, three runs
were scored and there were' two men on
bases. Crowley broke the spell by striKing
out. Mueller wont out at first and Crea
mer scored. i, Scott was s retired', on an easy
one, and i the came was over, the ' score

CRAZED WITH MORPHINE.
A Burglar In the City Prison Who Has
Twice Tried to Hang Himself.
James Haulton, alias Dalton, a prisoner
in the City Prison, has twice within the
past four days attempted to commit sui
cide by hanging himself.
He was arrested Saturday night on Clay
street by Policeman Furlong on a charge
of burglary. He is a physical wreck from
the use of morphine, and the want of the
drug during via confinement drove him al
most crazy.
He raised such a disturbance on Tues
day night with his cries for the drug that
he had to be put in the dark-cell. While
there he tore his shirt into strips, which
he tied together and then affixed to the
hole in the door. He made a noose,
placed it round his neck and was slowly
but surely being strangled, when Door
keeper Hickey discovered him and cut him
down.
Saturday afternoon, while one of the
other prisoners in the cell was asleep,
Haulton unloosed a piece of rope which
he had around, his waist as a belt without
disturbing him. Then he went into the
toilet-room in the rear of the cell, made a
noose ana tied the end of the rope to the
iron pipe that runs up the wall and placed
the noose round his neck.
One of the other prisoners beard a gurg
ling noise, and running to the toiiet-rooin
saw Hamilton suspended by the neck. He
gave the alarm and Hamilton was cut
down. He was black in the lace and it
was a few minutes before he could move
or speak.
The man is a pitiable object. He is ema
ciated in body and his mind is so affected
by the use of the drug that he is more like
an idiot than anything elst.

BURGLARS SECURE
VALUABLE GEMS,
Mrs. Richard Williams the
Victim of Midnight
Marauders.
THE ROBBERS ESCAPE.
A Gold Watch and Diamonds
Valued at $1500 Mysteri
ously Disappear.
ROBBED ON AN OAKLAND FERRY
An Unknown Alameda Lady Loses
Her Handbag Containing Eleven
Hundred Dollars.
Mrs. Richard Williams, wife of the ex-
Customs Inspector, is mourning the loss
of sundry valuable diamonds, a handsome
gold watch and a small amount of gold
coin. The total loss will probably reach
$1500.
The roboery occurred between 7 and 10
o'clock on the night of the big bicycle
demonstration.
The robbery was reported to the police
the next day.
On the night of the parade Mrs. Wil
liams left her home, 1028 Greenwich
street, to witness tbe demonstration, first
carefully storing her diamonds and gold
watch in a place she oelieved to he a safe
one.
When Mrs. Williams returned home
about 10:30 there was nothing to indicate
the presence of a- stranger. Everything
was in its customary place, so far as a
casual glance disclosed. She gave no
thought to the diamonds and the watch
and the money until the next morning,
when she concluded to pay a few visits.
She went to where she had hidden her
valuables, and, without so much as look
ing, reached in her hand for the jewel
case. It was there all right enough, but
when she opened it not a single sparkler
met her astonished gaze. Everything was
gone, even to a souvenir coin.
The robber3 r was immediately reported
to tne police, but no clew of the guilty
party has been obtained beyond a suspi
cionconiided to the detective by Mrs. Wil
liams. The person she suspects is being
ciosely watched, but has so far managed
to conduct himself in such a way as to
avoid actual arrest.
Incidentally it may be related that the
police on both sides of the bay, as well as
the Southern Pacific detectives, are trying
to locate a person who on Monday last
walked away with $1100 belonging to a
lady passenger on the ferry-boat Oakland.
The authorities refused to divulge the
name of tbe lady, but admit the robbery.
The facts in the case, however, are as
follows: On Monday last a lady living in
Alameda came to this City to dispose of a
piece of property. The transfer was
quickly made and at 3 o'clock the lady
boarded tne Oakland, intending to go
directly home. In a small handbag were
the proceeds of the saleâ slloo. When
about half-way over the lady observed a
friend at the other end o! the boat and
went to her. When near the Oakland slip
she suddenly remembered her handbag
and made a hurried visit to the spot
where she had left it- It was gone.
The robbery was at once reported to the
captain and a hurried search made for the
thief. Every passenger leaving the boat
was carefully watched, but no one with a
bag of the kind lost was observed. The
thief had either thrown it overboard or hid
it, intending to return for the valuable
crip when the excitement passed away.
The entire affair is shrouded in the deep
est mystery, except the fact that the
detectives have failed to recover the coin
and the further fact that the lady has
made a formal demand on the Southern
Pacific to make good her loss.
ARCHDEACAN FROM YUKON.
Talks of Alaska Missionary Work and
Progress Made.
Archdeacon Canham of the Church of
England arrived at the Occidental Satur
day from Auvik, Alaska. He is on his
way to Winnipeg to attend a meeting of
the general synod of the church.
Fifteen years aeo he was sent by the
Episcopal Church oi England Missionary
Society to labor among the Indians of the
far Northwest. Up to 1888 he spent his
time in the country about Fort McPherson,
on the Peel River. Subsequently he has
been in the Yukon country. He says that
the English Episcopal Church, the Epis
copal Church of America, the Greek
Church and the Catholic Church all have

missionaries in Alaska. The American
Episcopal Church has two missionaries on
the lower Yukon and is very soon to estab
lish two on the upper Yukon.
The Church of England missions are
under the charge or Bishop BompoÃ.
Bishop Rowe of the American Church,
sent up there last spring after the St. Paul
convention, is inspecting the field now.
He has been well received. The only
woman missionary in the whole region is
Miss Sabine of Canada, who is now at An
vik. There were two others, but they re
signed, and yesterday returned with the
arendeacon and his wife. One, a Miss
McDonald, is on her way to Scotland. She
was sent out by the Church of England.
Tbe other, Dr. Mary V. Glenton, is going
to her old home in New York.
The archdeacon says that the outlook in
the missionary field is good. The Indians
are peaceful and the children apt to learn.
But with the coming of white men the
liquor habit has come, and against its
hold on the Indians the missionaries are
contending.
NEARLY ASPHYXIATED.
Edward Williams, a Laborer, Found
Unconscious in a t-odgiiig- House
on Fourth Street.
Edward Williams, a laborer, about 25
years of age, engaged a room Saturday
evening in the lodging-house 222% Fourth
street. Yesterday morning about 6
o'clock a boy who occupied an adjoining
room heard groans from Williams' room.
He went into the room and found it full
of gas. Williams was in bed, unconscious.
Tne boy ran into the street and notified
the policeman on the beat, who sum
moned the ambulance from the Receiving
Hospital. The policeman found the gas
turned on full. One thing that puzzled
him was that no trace couM be found of
Williams' clothing, and it Hashed into his
mind that Williams might have been the
victim of a burglar. W T hen Dr. Helms
arrived with the ambulance search was
made for tbe Nothing, and it was discov
ered stuffed v-p the chimney, evidently
with the intention of preventing the gas
from escaping that way. The key of the
gas-jet was more than usually tight, so
that it was impossible to have turned it on
by accident.
Williams was taken to the hospital, and
Drs. Fitzgibbon and Helms by the use of
oxygen and other remedies soon restored
him to consciousness, and he was able to
leave the hospital a few hours later. He
said be had been drinking all night with
some friends, and he had no recollection
of going to his room, and could not ac
count for his clothes being stuffed up the
chimney or the gas being turned on. He
denied that he wanted to commit suicide.
SUICIDE UNJUSTIFIABLE,
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson's Lec
ture at Golden Gate
Hall.
It Is a Violation of Nature, and
Insanity Is the Only Possible
Excuse.
The Theosopbists had a packed house
at the last regular meet-ing at Golden Gate
Hall, when Dr. Jerome A. Anderson,
president of the San Francisco Branch of
the Theosophical Society in America,
lectured on "Suicide."
Dr. Anderson took the negative side of
the question recently discussed at such
great length in The Sunday Call, "Is
Suicide Justifiable Under Any Condi
tions?"
Dr. Anderson said:
"The prevalence of suicide among West
ern people is due entirely to wrong con
ceptions of life. These in their turn are
the result of materialistic teachings of
both religion and philosophy. The pure
materialist flouts the idea that, although
in the midst of eternity, he will ever have
other than a fleeting glimpse of sentient
life. For him ,the tragedy of existence
consists of one act and then the curtain is
rung down forever.
"So long as religion' and materialistic
philosophy unite in declaring that one
life enus the relations of the soul with
matter for all eternity, so long will they
be unable to recognize the wonderful, th<Â»
awful continuity of life, and that it can
not be laid aside at the whim or will of
ignorant man.
""This is the avenue by whi;h we must
approach the study of suicide, as well as
all other problems of human existence â
tbat man is one with nature. It id at
once evident that he is undergoing the
evolution apparent in all nature, only
upon a relatively higher plane of baine.
His soul may be said to represent a unit of
consciousness, just as stable, as incapable
of being destroyed as the corresponding
unit of matter* the atom. It is journey
ing through its evolutionary cycle of
necessity, adding accretions of wisdom as
the result of its conscious experience, in a
manner analogous to that by which the
atom grows by synthesizing other matter.
"Looking at life from this larger view
point, we must believe tbat man is a por
tion of his planet, and that he will remain
and evolve upon it until it can no longer
afford him new, nelj/ful, conscious experi
ences. And this is tne theory to which a
very large majority of the people of the
earth subscribe under the name of reincar
nation. Reincarnation is the very process
of human evolution.
"Nature has intended man to rest be
tween each conscious struggle with this
lower matter, and has provided the oppor
tunity in her law of cycles, which governs
all existence, whether of man or sun.
"Woe to all men who violat* any of her
immutable laws; but woe of woes to him
wno lifts his frenzied hand to cut short
the time she has appointed him for learn
ing his lessons of wisdom through experi
ence. For nature disowns him; he has no
place in her eternal harmonics â no place â
he is neither dead nor alive. Torn vio
lently out of his body by the most seltish
of acts, he must remain in a helpless
nightmarelike condition until the period
of that which would have been his normal
life has expired, when he can once more
enter tbe common stream of evolution,
but under the most unhappy conditions.
The suicide is a rebel against the Infinite;
one who is trying to evade the conse
quences of liis own acts.
"He cannot succeed. Torn out of the
body witb tbe tuought of suicide domina
ting his whole being, it will remain the
dominating thought during years of un
told agony. He will repeat in his imagin
ation all the urewsome details of his sui
cide, year after year, trying in vain to
escape from himself. Mo power in heaven
nor upon earth can prevent this, for he has
appealed to the infinite law of cause and
effect and he must abide its action.
"Therefore, there is no circumstance or
set of circumstances which can justify
suicide. Even from a purely selfish point
of view he who commits the act but adds
materially to his dreadful sufferings. Noth
ing but the utter irresponsibility of com
plete insanity will bar him from the con
sequences."
Boots and Shoes in Australia.
Robert Louden, a large boot and shoe mer
chant of Sydney, New South Wales, came here
Saturday to study the latest machinery used
in his line of business. He is at the Occi
dental. Mr. Louden says that under Prime
Minister Sir George Dibbs New South Wales
had a protective tariff of 11 cents ad valorem
on boots and shoes, and as a result the local
industry grew right up. But for the last two
years, under the regime of Prime Minister
Reid, free trade has prevailed and the boot
and shoe merchants are suffering from goods
imported lrom the United (States, England
and Victoria. American - made boots and
shoes, he declares, are selling in New South
\\ ales cheaper to-day than the same goods are
sold in this country. Owing to the tie-up at
Newcastle, Mr. Louden asserts, there are
ninety ships idly waiting to load with coal
cargoes.
tHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 1896.
PROPHET SMITH
HAS DISAPPEARED,
His Queer Home Lies De
serted on the Alameda
Flats.
A SUDDEN DEPARTURE.
The Strange Boat With a His
tory Tfiat Is No Longer
Tenanted.
HIS FRIENDS ABE ANXIOUS.
The Hermit Believed by Some to
Have Fall-en Overboard and
Drowned.
Richard Smith, the "Prophet of the
Spirits," has disappeared and his queer
home, an old battered sloop, lies silent
and deserted in her oozy bed in the marsh
near Alameda. For a year past Smith has
been the queerest of the many queer char
acters that make their homes on or near
the bay.
He has flitted about from one cove or
creek to another, anchoring for a time and
then moving on, as he claims, in response
to an order from a divine power. Wher
ever he has remained stationary for even
a short period he has preached the pecu
liar doctrine of the Poulson group of
spiritualists, mixed with theosophyâ for
Smith believes in the transmigration of
eouls â and in more than one instance,
particularly since he took up his abode
near Alameda, be has collected quite a
following of believers about him, to whom
he preached every Sunday while standing
in the rigging of his queer craft.
It is these friends, and particularly a
number of women who have become
deeply interested in his teachings, that
are making anxious inquiries for him.
From the time he arrived in the creek
in June last up to a week ago Smith, who
while apparently still robust, is well ad
vanced in years, had not left his boat for
more than a few hours at a titne.
At almost any nour of the day he could
be seen pottering about the Southern Pa
cificâfor such is the name of the prophet's
strange vessel â tinkering here and patch
ing there, in preparation, as he said, for a
call from above to move on, which he af
fected to believe would come at any time.
On Sunday, tbe 2d inst., he preached
from the side of the Southern Pacific as
usual, but has not been seen since. On
the Monday following a friend who called
to consult him regarding gome matter
found the sloop's cabin open, as though
Smith was somewere about, out he failed
to find the prophet. He waited sometime,
but the man he was looking for did not
appear and he left. Next day he called
again with the same result and was some
what alarmed to fin a things just as he left
them. A half-cooked meal was on the
The audacious attempt of several local Chinese firms to corrupt Federal offi
cers, as told in "The Call" of yesterday, created no end of comment in Chinatown
and among Government employes. It is generally conceded to be the nerviest
scheme ever undertaken by the almond-eyed citizens.
The members composing the firm of Mow Tuck & Co. have hitherto borne
an excellent reputation. Chin Wah Maw, who endeavored to engineer the trick,
claims to be a cousin of the leading member of the firm of Mow Tuck & Co. The
man, however, who really made the arrangements or, rather, thought he had. for
the illegal landing of 250 Celestials, is proprietor of a large fancy store on Sac
ramento street near Dupont. His name is known to the proper officials but it is
not thought best to make it public at present. The fellow speaks English fluently
and has an accurate knowledge of the methods employed in the illegal landing of
his countrymen. This fact gives rise to the suspicion that he has had a hand in
similar crimes in the past, but through the recent shake-up of the inspectors sud
denly finds himself without a tool.
During the year 1895 there was landed at this port 1417 Chinese, 98 of these
being women, for the i irst five months of the current year the statement i* made
unofficially that nearly 700 Chinese entered the United States through this port.
Since May, however, the business has fallen off fully 25 per cent. This may mean
a great deal or nothing, but in any event it is regarded as peculiar when the
numerous changes among the inspectors is remembered.
stove of the dingy cabin and everything
was in a condition indicating that the
occupant had stepped out with the inten
tion of returning in a moment.
He reported the matter to Ralph Ham
lin, the keeper of the Bay Farm island
bridge, who is also a police officer, and
since then a sharp lookout has been kept
on the Southern Pacific for the return of
the prophet. Some of his disciples in
quire every day whether he has returned,
but the answer is always in the negative
and the belief is spreading among his
followers that something has happened to
him.
They think that he has been seized
with some sort of fit and has fallen over
board and drowned, while those who be
lieve in his theosophical teachings say
that he has passed on to another exist
ence and that they will hear from him
shortly.
Those who believe that he has met with
some accident point to the fact that the
vessel's cabin was found open and every
thing as though the prophet Intended to
return in a moment, while it was Smith's
invariable custom to lock up his home
with a sturdy padlock that would defy
any but expert burglars whenever he left
even for an hour to cross the bridgÂ« for
provisions.
A number of Smith's followers visited
the Southern Pacific yesterday in hopes
of finding their teacher, bat were disap
pointed, as he came not. The dust is set
tling on the crockery and cooking utensils
that Smith was using just before he left
the cabin, and the canvas that covers the
hatchway is torn wfiere curiosity-seekers
have thrust it aside in order to see into the
dark apartment.
Prophet Smith was apparently not
cleanly in his habits, and his home will be
far less inviting unless he returns soon to
claim his own. Ralph Hamlin has taken
charge of the boat, and will hold her until
Smith returns or his fate is ascertained.
AN ILLUSTRATED SERMON.
The Third of a Series Delivered Last
X veiling.
Last evening Rev. Frank K. Baker, pas
tor of the Eoworth M. E. Church, gave to
a large audience the third of a series of
illustrated sermons. Each sermon is il
lustrated by three large oil paintings of
Scriptural scenes bearing on the sermon.
These paintings are designed and ar
ranged for pulpit use, and are beautiful
and impressive pictures of important
truths.
The sermon last eveuing was based on
John iii:2â "The same came to Jesus by
night."
The first painting represented Nico
demus seeking Christ under cover of
night. He was held up as a type of the
timid seeker after truth. It was not only
night without, but night within, Nico
demus' heart. He was earnestly desirous
of entering the kingdom of God, and was
not rejected because of bis natural tim
idity.
The second painting represented Christ
and Nicodemus in earnest conversation.
The latter, "a ruler of the Jews," inquir
ing of Christ, a teacher come from God,
concerning the greatest subject that can
engage the attention of man â the redemp
tion of man.
The third painting represented the ef
fects of this inquiry meeting â Nieodemus
defending Christ before the Sanhedrim,
and bringing a mixture of myrrh and
aioes and helping with the burial of his
Lord and Master.
The sermon was full of helpful sug
gestions and practical application of the
truth. The subject next Sunday evening
will be on "The Hearty Seeker, and the
paintings will be tbe best of all the series.

CUT RATES TO
ORIENTAL PORTS,
Bold Invasion of the Terri
tory of the Pacific
Mail.
JAPANESE COMPETITION
The Nippon Yusen Kaisha Has
Opened an Oiice m San
Francisco.
ITS LOW SCHEDULE OF FARES.
Will Soon Be jn Position to Bid for
Freight Against Huntington's
Line.
"Nippon Yusen Kaisha (Japan Mall
Steamship Company. Regular steamers
to all Asiatic points."
This is the announcement that appears
on a Montgomery-street show window in
handsome letters of gold and black. It is
the first announcement of the evident pur
pose of the new trans-Pacific steamships
to make an aggressive fight against the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company end the
Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany for Oriental business.
The local agent of the Japan Mail Steam
ship Company will be Mr. Price, the local
general agent of the Great Northern Rail
way, with which the Japanese company
has just made a traffic arrangement, with
Seattle as the United States terminus of
tbe steamship line. This makes it possi
ble for a through bill of iading to be issued
from Yokohama, Japan, to Buffalo, N. V.,
practically over one line, extending one
third tbe distance around the earth.
R. C. Stevens, the general Western pas
senger agent of the Great Northern, ar
rived here Friday night from Seattle, and
was busy all day Saturday arranging de
tails for the handling of passenger busi
ness to the Orient and familiarizing him
self with the situation, as the trans-Pacific
business is entirely new to him.
"The other northern lines running
between the United States and the Asiatic
ports," he said, "are getting business in
this City, and I see no reason why we
should not be able to get a share of it,
particularly as the Nippon Yusen Kaisha
is in a much better position to secure and
handle it.
"We shall compete for both passenger
and freight, business. W. B. Ben bam, the
Western freight manager of the Great
Northern, will be herein a few daystolook
after the freight arrangements.
"Our company now has a traffic arrange
ment with the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company for the transportation of passen
gers and freight to Seattle, which is to
move over our railroad line from that point,
and so far as tbe passengers who desire to
leave here for the Orient via Seattle, the
same traffic arrangement will hold good.
Passengers will be taken to Seattle on the
vessels of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company and there transferred to the
Nil pon Yusen Kaisha.
"The first of the Japan mail steamers
will leave Seattle on the sth of September.
It will be the Miike Maru, which is due to
arrive at the American port on the 25th of
the present month. She is a vessel of 4600
tons, will accommodate about twenty-five
cabin or first-class passengers and an un
limited number of Chinese or Japanese in
the steerage."
The schedule of passenger rates from
Seattle to various Asiatic points has al
ready been issued. It shows a most marked
reduction from these of the Pacific Mail
and the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
companies from this port to the same
points across the Pacific. The rates from
this City to these Asiatic points, via Seattle
and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's steamers,
are made up of the local rate from the City
to Seattle, and the rate from Seattle to the
point of destination.
Herewith is a table of rates comparing
the first and third class rates respectively
of the two rival companies from San Fran
cisco to all the points to which the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha is at present prepared to
carry passengers:

The great reduction shown in the
rates of the Japanese company is due to
the fact that it will carry passengers to all
points named in this schedule in their
own steamers, while the Pacific Mail runs
its own steamers only to Honolulu, Yoko
hama and Hongkong. The comparison is
made with first and second class rates
only because the second-class business is
but a very small proportion of that done
between the United States and the Orient.
In order to arrive at the rates that pre
vail between Seattle and the Oriental
points $27 must be deducted from the San
Francisco rate for first-class fares and $15
for third-class fares.
Mr. Stevens stated further that it was
the intention to run one steamer a month
for the present from Seattle. Three new
steamers, he added, are being now built
on the Clyde for this service. They will
be between 4t>oo and 5000 tons burden, and
be fitted up in the best modern style for
passengers. It is expected that many
"globe-trotters" will give preference to
the Seattle route to the Orient, as it will
afford not only cheaper rates, but the op
portunity to see more territory than by
the Pacific Mail route direct.

she soon recovered, and was taken -; home

FEAST OF ST. DOMINIC,
The Day Is Solemnly Commem
orated at the Dominican
Church.
Franciscan Fathers Officiate, and
Father Wyman Preaches an
Eloquent Sermon.
The feast of St. Dominic, the founder of
the Dominican order, was commemorated
in this City with solemn ceremonies in
the Church of St. Dominic on Steiner and
Bush streets. There was an unusually
large congregation at the late morning
mass; in fact, the large church was
crowded with devout worshipers, who
make it a rule to participate in the cele
bration of festivals in that church. The
altars were beautifully decorated with a
profusion of flowers and evergreens and
lighted by numerous candles.
Solemn high mass was sung by Father
Maximilian, O. S. F., of St. Boniface
Church, who was assisted by Father
I Augustin, 0. S. F., and Father James, O.
iB. F. It is customary among the Domini
i cans and Franciscans to exchange on
i feast days, and that is why the Franciscan
I fathers officiated yesterday at the special
services in honor of the saint.
The sermon was preached by the Rev.
Father Wyman, pastor of tne Paulists'
church on California street. He chose for
his text the words of St. Paul to the
I Romansâ tenth chapter, fifieenth verse:
I " How beautiful are the feet of
I them that preach the gospel of peaceâ
of them that bring glad tidings of good
things!"
"The vocation of the preacher, said
he, "according to the teaching and ex
amples of holy scripture, is the holiest to
which any one can be called. Banctity,
not human eloquence, is the divine stand
ard by which fitness for it is determined.
The vocation of the preacher has been
sanctified by the public ministry of our
divine Savior, who, previous to entering
on his public life, spent thirty years in
obscurity. Great indeed is the dignity of
preaching. It is the voice of God on
Mount Sinai, tne voice of our Savior on
Mount Zion, the divine sower scattering
seeds of truth.
"Preaching is to-day considered the
most essential thing in all the popular re
ligions, ana even among those who have
the least doctrine to teach and do not con
sider faith as essential to salvation. Their
standard, however, is not the divine. Al
though possessing great eloquence they
may be compared with those persons
whom St. Paul mentions as having many
virtues without charity. The apostles
were trained for their work in the school
of our Lord, and after receiving the Holy
Ghost carried on the ministry of preach
ing; and this divine vocation has been
perpetuated in the church.
"One of the greatest lights is that of the
great St. Dominic, a preacher of God's
word and the founder of an order of
preachers. In his early clerical career
Dominic did not think of becoming a
preacher. He desired a hidden life of con
templation, and passed a number of years
leading a conventual life as the canon of a
cathedral church."
Father Wyman t'-.en reviewed the salient
points in St. Dominic's career, how he de
termined to become a preacher when he
met the Albyensis. Wita six companions
he brought baclc these people to the
Catholic fold, and so thoroughly was the
work done Lhis heresy never revived. The
reverend speaker said that the influence
of the Dominican order on the church aud
the world has been very wide. Dominicans
have ranked among the leading scholars
of history, and their theologians especially
are pre-eminent.
