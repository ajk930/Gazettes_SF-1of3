SANDUSKY SENDS ITS QUOTA.
Prolonged Applause Greets the Stan
dard-flearer When He Tells of
Future Prosperity.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 19.â A delegation
of about 300 voters from the Lehigh Valley
district of Pennsylvania arrived in this
city at 10 o'clock this morning to pay
their respects to Major McKinley. The
visitors came from Shamokin and a num
ber of other towns between that place and
Wiikesbarre. Hazelton and Freeland
â were pretty well represented. Owing, to
the continued inclement ' weather the
party was hurried by the Canton citizens'
reception committee to the. Tabernacle.
Congressman Charles L. Brumm of Potts
ville, Pa., acted as spokesman for the vis
itors. In his remarks to the candidate he
predicted that Pennsylvania would send a
solid Republican delegation to the next
Congress besides giving McKialey a ma
jority of three-quarters of a million
votes.
Major McKinley in response dwelt at
length upon the tariff question. "We have
more free trade in this country," he de
clared, "than any other country in the
world, but it is free trade at home and
among our own States. We want all that
kind of free trade we can have, but we
want no free trade with foreign countries."
He concluded by urging the necessity of
a sound currency. -
Sandusky County sent a big crowd of its
inhabitants to call on the major this af
ternoon. They came in sections by differ
ent routes, and when they had all congre
gated at the Tabernacle there were fully
1000 in the party. Despite the rain "they
were unusually enthusiastic. Clyde,
Bellevue, Fremont and Green Springs
were among the towns represented.
Among those who accompanied the dele
gation was Scott Hayes, son of 'the.late
President Hayes. After the singing of
several campaign songs by an ' uncom
monly good glee club which came with
the visitors, R. D. Dewey, an . attorney ot
Clyde, acting as the spokesmen of the
party, made the introductory address.
He : eulogized * the late President Hayes
and spoke of the magnificent war records
of the late Generals Buckland and Me-
Pherson, the remains of all of whom rest
within the borders of Sandusky County.
When Major Mclflnley responded he
was greeted with great, applause. He
said:
Ohio is fall of glorious memories and the
words of your spokesman have revived them
in my mind. I know of no State in the Union
that has contributed more to the honor and
glory of- the Republic than the State of Ohio.
I know of no county in the State that carries
the ashes of more noble dead than Sandusky
County, which you represent. But you have
come here, my fellow-citizens, to give me
assurances ol ' your devotion to the Repub
lican cause, and pleasing, as it would be to
me, to indulge further in reminiscences, I
must call your attention in the briefest man
ner to some of the subjects which are engag
ing at this moment the attention of the
American people. The condition of the conn
try is such that every man is thinking about
it; every woman is thinking, about it, and
wondering how we are to improve that condi
tion.
I read to-day in the North American Review
an article by the Secretary of the Navy, Mr.
Herbert of Alabama, whom I well knew as a
member of the National House of Representa
tives. He has just visited Europe, and he de
scribes the Dusiness conditions of Germany and
England and France as presenting an era of
activity and prosperity, the like of which they
never enjoyed before. He closes by saying
that the United States was never so unprosper
ous as it is to-day, and then he makes the in
quiry: "Why is it the United States and its
working people, with all our natural, re
sources, are not enjoying a share of the pros
perity that is enjoyed by England and Ger
many and France?" We all know, my fellow
citiiens, why we are in the midst of depres
sion now, ana I think we know why these
great nations of the world, our competitors,*
are prosperous. We are doing less of our own
work and they are doing more of it for us.
Everybody admits the condition that Mr. Her
bert describes. I need not stop to discuss with
you the cause. Everybody knows its source.
The question in every American mind is
Dow to remove the cause and how to get back
the old prosperity which we had enjoyed for
more than a thirl of a century. If we don't
use the power of the ballot which we rossess
to subserve our own best lnterrsts then we do
not use the ballot to the best advantage. IWe
cannot improve the condition of this country
by decreasing the value of our money and
making believe that 52 cents worth of silvei
Is a dollar.. [Laughter and applause.]
After listening \ attentively to the ad
dress of Major McKinley a procession, wai
formed and the more enthusiastic mem
bers of the party, "beaded by a band o
music, marched through. the rain and uj
to the McKinley residence. There thej
presented to Mrs. McKinley a beautifu
collection of roses, the gift of the ladies o
SandusJcy.
It is expected that October' 14, wbict
has been designated as Illinois day, wil
be the most notable day of the campaigi
in this city. Between 8000 and 10,000 peo
pie, it is believed, will make the journej
from different points of Illinois, and ex
tensive preparations for their entertain
ment are being made by the citizens' re
ception committee. The '.'f visitors wil
bring a carload of horses for their own us<

Conimitteeruan Durbin , returned from
Indianapolis to the Republican National
headquarters and reported : the result vof

bin was successful in arranging a schedule
of thirty-six speeches for Mr. Harrison,
not including numerous short talks which
he will make from the special train that
will take the party through the State.
Mr. Durbin said the great demands which
had been made on General Harrison by
personal and political friends and party
organizations throughout the Union to
deliver addresses had no doubt forced him
to the necessity of declining to speak out
aide of Indiana.
United States Senator George W. Mc-
Bride of Oregon came to headquarters
from the coast and assured Chairman
Hanna that a great change had come over
the voters of that State favorable to Mc-
Kinley, and the same was true of Wash
ington. Committeeman Payne said he
had received a report from the Washing
ton State Committee informing him that
there had been a landslide of Republi
canism i* the last ten days. Committee
man Cummins returned from a fifteen
days' trip to Iowa. He said he had made
a careful canvass of his State and esti
mated McKinley's majority would not be
less than 40,000. He declared the majority
had increased every day he cad been in
the State.
Congressman Boutelle will speak in
Los Angeles next Saturday, in Sacramento

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 13.â Governor
Raymon Coral of the State of Sonora,
Mexico, accompanied by Secretary of
State Ortez, is staying at the Waldorf
Hotel. Governor Coral, speaking to-day
upon the silver question, aaid :
"The conditions obtai- ing in my coun
try on a silver basis and those in the
United States on a gold basis are so radi
cally tiifferent that it is impossib c to
make a comparison between them. Each
country must be considered by itself.
"The result in the United States if the
Chicago platform should be adopted," he
saia, "would be disastrous.
"For myself, I do not believe that if
Bryan is elected his party will dare to
pass the free-coinage law proposed. It
would not only be disastrous, as I have
said, but would precipitate revolution. It
is nonsense to nay that the United Btates
is able to establish and maintain a finan
cial policy of the character proposed in
dependent of the rest of trie world.
"There are two things no Government
can do. One is to create an artificial
value and exact it; the other is to isolate
itself from the rest of the world and
achieve permanent prosperity."

were now sounding all over the country in
presenting ti.e tendency 'of the Chicago
platform toward revolution. Mr. Hanna
said the tariff was now the chief topic of
the speeches being made by the committee
orators, and he did not place much faith
in a concentration of forces and successive
demonstrations in Cook County the last
two weeks of the campaign. He said the
number of voters who could be induced to
change their opinions at that late Hour
would not affect the general resnlt.

THE CASTLES MAY
NOW BE CLEARED
Released on Bonds Pending
a Trial of the Case
by Jury.
An Unfortunate Affair That
Promises to Be Speedily
Terminated.
MRS. CASTLE'S SAD CONDITION.
Friends of the Accused See a Favor
able Indication in the Nearness
of the Hearing-
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 13.âNotwithstand
ing the hope of the friends of Walter M.
Castle and his wife, Ella, that one or both
would be released at the examination in
the Great Marl borough- street Court to
day, their plea of "not guilty" was not ac
cepted. When the case was called Solic
itor- Abrahams, who represents the ac
cused merchant ana his wife, made a
formal motion for dismissal in the case of
Mr. Castle on the ground that he had had
no connection with the alleged thefts.
His defense for Mrs. Castle was klepto
mania, as had been outlined.
On behalf of Mrs. Castle, expert testi
mony was introduced to show her mental
irresponsibility.
The Public Prosecutor introduced the
three tradesman from whose shops the
furs had been taken, Tbey testified as
to the loss of the articles found in posses
sion of the Castles, and said Mr. Castle
accompanied his wife when they were
taken. Evidence as to the finding of the
property in the room of the accused mer
chant and his wife in the Hotel Cecil was
also introduced.
On this showing the magistrate refused
to accept either plea. The defense was
given the option of having the case dis
posed of there and then by the magistrate,
who could fix sentence, or of having it re
manded for trial by jury. They accepted
the iatter alternative and the cases were
set for trial on Tuesday of next week.
Counsel for the accused asked that they
might be released on bail and the request
was granted, though bail was fixed at the
large sum of Â£20,000 each. The accused
were returned to prison pending the ar
rival of bail bonds, for which their friends
immediately began to make arrangements.
The physicians of Holloway jail stated
to the court that the detention of Mrs.
Castle in jail had been and would con
tinue to be highly injurious to her health.
The prisoners were then admitted to
bail in the sum of Â£40,000 ($200,000) for
their appearance in court next Tuesday,
they having been further remanded until
that day. Bail was furnished in two sure
ties of Â£5000 each for Mrs. Castle, and the
same for Mr. Castle, and the prisoners'
own recognizances for Â£10,000 each. The
sureties included Julius Simon of the
Anglo-Californian Bank; Adolphus Co
hen, diamond merchant, Holborn. and
Louis Weill, goldsmith, Hatton Garden.
The fourth surety was Charles Gnthrie
of the firm of Chalmers, Guthrie & Co.,
bankers and merchants of 9 Idol lane,
London.
Every effort will now be bent to mace a
complete defense when the case shall
come up for trial next week. In addition
to expert medical testimony from London
physicians' testimony from CaHfornia will
be introduced to show kleptomania in
Mrs. Castle. Notwithstanding the unfav
orable result of the plea of not guilty in
the case of Mr. Castle his friends here are
confident that he will be acquitted at the
trial. The fact that they were given the
privilege of bail, and that their trial was
set for as early as next week, is considered
a favorable indication.
WITH TERRELL ON DECK.
The United States Practice Ship Bancroft
Is to Force the Dardanelles
and Defy Turkey.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 13.â A Sun
special from Washington says:
The United States practice ship Ban
croft, whose departure for European
waters has been the subject of profound,
mystery, is to play an important part in
the effort of the powers to bring about a
settlement of the Turkish question.
The little vessel is to force the Darda
nelles with Minister Terrell standing on
her deck, and if any obstacles are placed
in the way by the lurKish forts the Medi
terranean fleet, under Admiral Selfridge,
now 150 miles away, will come to her
assistance. The British fleet will also, no
douot, be near at hand to back the Ameri
can commander if occasion arises. From
the highest authority it is learned that
the powers have agreed to the programme
and not only will offer no objection or re
sistance to the entrance of the Bancroft
to the Golden Horn, but will aid her if
necessary. ___^________ â .
SUFFERED FOR MINE DAYS
Rescue of the Crew of the Nor
wegian Bark Lovize From
Open Boats.
After Rescuing S.i ors From a Sink
ing Vessel the Heroes Abandoned
Their Own Craft
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Oct. 13. â The
steamer Evelyn arrived here to-night with
the crew of the Norwegian bark Lovize
aboard. The Lovize was abandoned while
od a voyage from Mobile for Rosario, Ar
gentine Republic, and after nine days of
suffering in an open boat her crew was
picked ut> by the Evelyn. The Lovize left
Mobile on August 16, with a cargo of pitch
pine. On September 1 a heavy gale of
wind was encountered, before which the
bark scudded for two days.
On the 9:h a dismantled ship was
sighted laboring in the sea. The Lovize
bore down to her and First Mate Edward
Callacksen and two men put off in a small
boat to tue laboring ship. The trip was at
the risk of the men's lives, as a heavy sea
was still running. Nevertheless they
reached the sinking bark, which proved to
be the P. E. Marshall of DigDy, N. 8., and
from Savannah for Santos, Brazil, with a
cargo of pitch pine.
In four trips the men of the Marshall
were put aboard the Lovize. The Lovize
then made sail and landed the Marshall's
crew at the Bermudas. After leaving the
Bermudas the Lovize had pleasant weather
until September 23, when a gale sprang
up and the bark soon sprang a leak.
The men worked at the pumps, but the
bark made water rapidly, and by Septem
ber 25 there was thirteen feet of water in
the hold. The bark was then in longitude
50, latitude 35. Unable to keep the bark
afloat the crew took to the boats, there be
ing in all nine men to the crew.
The crew, were well provisioned and
watered, but the heavy sea running
swept half of the water overboard. Fi
nally the two boats were lashed together
and a sea anchor put out, and in this way
they rode out the gale.
For nine days the men drifted along un
der the tropical sun, and with but one
drink of water a day suffered great agony
and anxiety. When tbey had nearly
abandoned hope they were picked up by
the steamer Evelyn. The Lovize was a
bark of 1053 tons and hailed from
Christiania, Norway.
SPREAD RUIN ON ALL SIDES.
Great Harrington, Mass., Swept by a
Most Disastrous Fire, Causing
Great Destruction.
GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass., Oct.
13. â The fire which swept over this place
last night spread disaster on all sides. The
business portion of the town was almost
completely destroyed. The telephone and
telegraph wires were burned out. Some
estimate the extent of the damage at
$300,000 and others at a much higher
figure. The fire was got under control at
daybreak and at 5 o'clock-was entirely ex
tinguished. Along Railroad avenue every
building was gutted. The Church block,
the principal one here, was utterly de
stroyed. About sixty firms, representing
all kinds of business, and many families
were driven into the streets. The railroad
station was one of the few places that es
caped.
The Mill Hotel was also badly damaged.
Another fire broke out at 2 o'clock this af
ternoon in the annex of the hotel, but was
quickly extinguished.

FORT WORTH, Tex., Oct. 13. â The
National Livestock Exchange to-day lis
tened to the annual address of President
Thompson. Referring to prohibitive leg
islation enacted by foreign countries
against American products, he said the
unsoundness of our meais and meat prod
ucts has been the alleged cause for some
of this inimical legislation, but he em
phatically denied that there was any
foundation in fact for such action, and
courted the most careful scrutiny and
scientific examination of American live
stock and its products. Reciprocity, he
continued, would open for our surplus
the foreign gates of commerce that are
now closed, and the resultant benefit
would be felt in every channel of com

DISASTER NEAR
PACIFIC GROVE
Moonlight Driving Party
Hurled From a Steep
Embankment.
One Life Lost, Ten Lads Injured
and Their Four Horses
Killed.
TO THE BOTTOM OF A GULCH.
Football Players Returning From
Salinas Lose the Road on the
Toro Grade.
PACIFIC GROVE, CalÂ», Oct. 13.â One
life was lost, four lads were dangerously
injured and half a dozen badly hurt in a
disaster last night on the Toro grade, be
tween this city and Salinas. A four-horse
wagonette, carrying the Pacific Grove High
School football team from Salinas, where
it had played against a high school eleven,
plunged over an enbankment to the bot
tom of a gulch forty feet below. All of tha
horses were killed and tne occupants of
the wagon were pinned down under the
wreckage, or under the bodies of the ex
piring animals. Frank Oyer died soon
after being extricated. He was the 17
---year-old son of a Pacinc Grove capitalist.
The seriously injured are :
James Mori, a Japanese, legs badly
crushed and bruised about head and arms.
Eddie Rich, chest crushed.
Lewis Dangerfield, nose broken and arm
badly cut.
Frank Hart, hurt about head and
shoulders.
William Johnson, fingers crushed.
Thomas Gordon, a cripple, badly bruised
and cut on the body.
Frank Ellis, leg cut badly.
Charles Little, the driver, cut about tha
face and head.
Yesterday's game of football was tha
first ever played in Monterey County.
The Pacific Grove boys rode to Salinas in
a large four-in-hand rig. The game beÂ°an
at 2 o'clock and was over by 4:30. At 5
o'clock the boys, after having been de
feated by the Salinas athletes, started on
the homeward trip. It was a beautiful
moonlight night, but when tne road ran
through the canyon two miles this side of
the Laguna Seca ranch the side-lights of
the wagonette were lighted. The dust
along this part of the road at this time cf
tne year is frequently from six to eight
inches deep. After proceeding down the
canyon for a half-mile the driver finally
drew rein and got down and extinguished
the lights, for the reason that they were a
hindrance rather than a help to him in
showing the roadway. Quite a breeze was
blowing up the canyon from Monterey
Bay, and this tended to keep the dust in
circulation, so that at times all four horsei
were entirely enveloped and the driver
was unable to distinguish his leaders. At
tnese times he could not see the road at
all, and would stop until the dust blew
away before trying to proceed. Charles
Little was driving the team. He is an old,
stagedriver and had been over this road
probably fifty times without an accident.
In another four-in-hand rig there wera
seated twenty of the high school girls,
who went over from this place to "root"
for their school team while it played foot
ball. They were just ahead of the boys
all the way from Salinas, and were gaily
singing their college songs and giving the
school yell. Sometimes the boys in the
wagonette behind would answer. Thus
they went along, all trying to make tha
lone ride as pleasant ns possible.
Suddenly, as the horses drawing the
boys' vehicle were trotting slowly down
the long grade, the front wheel slipped
over an embankment, the wagonette cap
sized and went tumbling down fully forty
feet into the gulch below. About ten feet
from the top there was a large box culvert
projecting out from the tank about three
feet. This hindered the plunge of tne rig
downward, and it is believed by all the
boys .who escaped without serious injury
that this culvert saved their lives, for as
soon as they struck it tuey attempted to
climb out of the vehicle and jump.
For only a few seconds, however, did
the wagonette remain in this position.
The four horses were unable to free them
selves from the harness when they went
over the embankment, and they fell on
top of the large canopy covering. Thia
extra weight snapped the boxing of the
culvert, and wagon, horses and boys went
crashing through the trees to the gulch
below, landing all in a heap. One boy
was straddled on the brakerod, with an
other one on top of him and a large horse
on top of both. The horses kicked and
plunged, driving their hoofs with fury
against the human bodies around them.
All of the occupants of the vehicle mar
vel that more were not killed. The large
wagonette was completely demolished and,
all four horses are dead. The rig was
piled in a hopeless wreck, with the boys
beneath it.
The accident took place on the Toro
grade, about seven miles from Monterey
and on the county road to Salinas. The
roadbed by neglect has been allowed to
wash and wear away, so that the roadbed
proper at the point of the accident is just
ten and a half feet wide, while the other
part of the road on both sides of the gulch
is fully twenty-five feet wide.
The hero of the party was John Willey,
the 16-year-old son of R. H. Willey, an
attorney of this city. He was the first to
free himself from the wreckage at the
bottom of the gulch. Then be imme
diately jumped in among the struggling
horses and attempted to save his com
panions. Two horses, although their

Young Wiiley succeeded in pulling one

being able to find young Oyer, who was
calling lor help, he rusbed up thfi em
bankment and ran for a mile and a half to
a farmhouse and procured a lantern and
ax. When he reached the scene of the
accident he was almost exhausted, but he
had enough strength to summon th- boys
to help Hit the heavy wagonette off from
those tinder ii.
"It was an awfully dark night, said he
to-day. "We could not see our own horses
at times, and the dust made it all the
worse. We were about fifty yards behind
the first wapronette with the girls in it. I
was on the second teat â the seat Frank
Oyer rode onâ but on the left side. We

commenced to go. Justus soon as we hit
that culvert 1 jumped. I would have done
it before, but did i.ot have a chance, for
not one of us had any idea oi capsizing
until we went over. As I was about clear
of the rig I heard something snap and
down we plunged again. I was thrown
away out on the branches of tne trees, but
still held on to the canopy, because I did
not know where I was.
"When we struck bottom I was pinned
under the canopy, but it did not take me
long to get out. I could hear the boys
veiling for help, especially Frank Oyer.
1 seemed right near him, yet could not
quite locate him. He called me by name and
implored me to help him, saying that he
could not move. The horses were making
such an awful noise kicking and strug
gling that I backed out of the wreck. I
saw young Rich with a horse on top of
him. so I tried to get the animal off and
finally succeeded. This horse was dead,
for it did not move after I rolled it off. I
called to Oyer tnat I could uot find him,
but that I Knew where we were and I
would run and get a lantern and an ax.
"In the meantime one boy had suc
ceeded in extricating himself, and know
ing the other rig to be not far ahead he
ran down the road and told its occupants
what had happened.
"When I was starting for the farmer's
house I met the ladies all coming back,
but I did not stop running until 1 reached
the rancher's bouse. When 1 returned the
boys had gotten young Oyer out from
under the wa^on and had him up on the
road. There was so much confusion that
no one seemed ;o know whether there
â¢were any more of the boys under the rig
or not, so I got some of the boys and went
down into the gulch and lifted the wagon
over. Every horse but one was dead. I
can't say how the accident occurred, only
that the road was too narrow along thero
and that it was awfully dark and dusty."
Mrs. Galianer, who cnaperoned the girls
and was in the first vehicle, gave a very
clear account of the awful state of affairs
when she arrived at the scene of the acci
dent.
"The girls were aUJsinging," said she,
"and I noticed that the boys were very
quiet, but attributed it to their being
tired after their game. It was very dark
in the canyon, but on the level tne moon
shone brilliantly. The road was dusty,
but exceptionally so along the grade
down the canyon. I was on the first seat
with the driver, a:id I could not see the
leaders for the dust. We drove very
slowly all the way, and especially around
this place. I noticed the gulch as we
passed, and also noticed how extremely
Blow our driver passed the place. I heard
the crash, but supposed tnat it was the
boys catching branches as they passed
and breaking them. 1 also heard them
yell, but we did not stop until Yonng
Hart came running up and said, 'For
God's sake stop; we are all nearly aead.'
"We then stopped the team ana all
went back to the gulch. On our way we
met John Willey running down the road,
but he wouid not stop. When we reached
the gulcn, which was about fifty yards
from where we stopped our team," I could
hear the boys calling for help, but it was
so dark I could not see how the wagonette
lay in the gulch. The boys told me Frank
Oyer was under the wagon and horses,
but that they could not find him in the
darkness. They had very few matches, so
I took off one of my white skirts and
burned it. This served the purpose of a
torch admirably, and witn its light we
could se-i poor Frank Oyer pinned down
uuiierone wheel. A horse was very near
him and kicking wildly, while one was on
top of the lad. All this time he was call
ing for us to help him, and the
young boys were working manfully
to reniove the obstructions, but to no
avail. Oyer called to one of the boys say
ing, 'I'll die if you don't help me.' That
was enou. b, and with superhuman effort
they succeeded in extricating bim, but
when we got him to the top of the em
bankment be was dead. I believe be
breathed just once after they brought him
up. Some of the girls had made a fire by
tnis time, and everything was done to re
suscitate him, but all to no avail.
"Several of the girls got down into that
gulch to help, too, and acted nobly under
the awful excitement. The road was in
deed very narrow and very dusty, but I do
not believe that it was carelessness at all
on the driver's part, but that he could not
see. Our team helped to raise the dust
which settled over the Boyd vehicle."
Eddie Rich, the 15-year-old son of the
Marshal of Pacific Grove, was one of the
most seriously injured. He said: 'When
we went over 1 was on the front seat, next
to Charles Little, the driver, l tried to
jump, but could not. W T hen we struck the
bottom of that gulch I thought we had
fallen nearly 100 feet. I thought that
everybody was on me, except Mori, the
Japanese, and I found he was under me.
He toid me to get off, but there was a
horse on top of me and I could not budge
him. 1 kicked and yelled and scratched,
pinched and even bit the animal, out be
would not stir. He was right on .my
chest, too, and the pain was intense. I
called to Johnnie Willev, whom I conld
hear talking, to puli the thing off, and he
finally succeeded in doing it. I then got
up and we two released poor little Mikie,
the Japanese. He had one leg wedged in
between the brakerod and the wagon and
the other on top of it. We had a hard
time getting him out.
"We three crawled out from tinder
the wreck and I tried to help the other
boys. We laid the Japanese on the ground
and he moaned for quite awhile, but we
wanted to get Over out. He was calling
all the time. 'Boys, I am in a box; help
me, won't you?' Young Oyer stayed
under that wagon for nearly an hour be
fore we could get i.im out, and when wo
did finally succeed 'he lived only about
three minutes. His neck was broken and
a horse must have kicked him. I think
he was smothered, too, by the dust kicked
up by the horses.
"We wanted Mrs. Galianer to let some
of the girls get into our busbefore leaving
Salinas, but she would not. We are glad
of it now."
Mr. Goward. an elderly gentleman who
was in the rig with the boys, says he was
asleep when the wagon slipped down, but
be soon woke up.
"How it was I was not killed I don't
know," said he. "All the young boys
worked like Trojans last night to help the
injured, and the girls worked, too. When
we got to Frank Over under the rig I
think he was dead. I do not believe it
was carelessness on the driver's part. I
noticed that he was careful before we got
into the canyon."
Miss Hessel, one of the party, last night
was so excited over the affair that to-day
her hair was perfectly white. She worked
as hard as any of the boys during the ex
citement and on the way home this morn
ing at about 3 o'clock she was still very
much excited. She is now confined to her
bed with nervous prostration.
Dr. J. P. E. Heintz was summoned to
the scene of the accident at 10 o'clock last
night. He made an examination of the
boys as best he could and then the injured
ones were brought to Monterey as quickly
as possible.
The funeral of Frank Oyer will be held
to-morrow at 1 o'clock from the Episcopal
church in Pacific Grove.
The Coroner's jury was in session since
8 o'clock this morning and did not arrive
at a verdict until late to-night They
went over the road and viewed the scenes
of the accident, and, after hearing the tes
timony of the witnesses, reached the fol
lowing verdict:
"We will not censure the county and
hereby exonerate Charles Little, the
driver, from carelessness."
THIRTEEN TALKS

in Minnesota.
During the Journey He Is Very
Frequently Greeted With
Cheers ior McKinley..
SINGS IN PRAISE OF TOWNE.
In Return the St. Louis Bolter Shouts
for the Chicego P atform and
the NebrÂ£skan.
DULUTH, Mixn., Oct. 13.â Thirteen
speeches and 200 miles of roundabout
travel throughout Minnesota, with a little
slice of Wisconsin included, was William
J. Bryan's campaigning record to-day.
Eleven of the speeches were made in the
journey between Minneapolis and Duluth.
Anoka," Eik River, Big Lake, St. Cloud,
Rices, Little Falls, Staples, Brainerd,
Aitken, Cariton and West Superior were
tbe places where tbe nominee's special
train stopped long enough to enable him
to make addresses. West Superior, Wis.,
with 10,000 and St. Cloud Minn., with
5000 people, gave the largest audiences of
the day excepting, of course, the figures
of the Duluth reception.
At a number of places along the line of
the Northern Pacific Mr. Bryan found that
many of his hearers wore the familiar yel
low slips oi paper or ribbon containing
the name of his Republican opponent.
At Brainerd they were numerous enough
to call forth a few comments by the
nominee. Cheers for McKinley were heard
at the stops; in fact the day began with
them at Anoka, where Mr. Bryan de
livered his tirst speech.
To-day's trip was taken by tbe Demo
cratic candidate for the express purpose of
aiding Representative Charles A. Towne
in his fight for re-election to the Federal
Legislature. Mr. Towne bolted the St.
Louis platform and was renominated by
the silver Republicans, the Populists and
the Democrats. The route lay through
Mr. Towne's Congressional District â the
Sixth â and Mr. Bryan put in a good word
for the Congressman at every opportunity,
Mr. Towne, who accompanied him, re
sponding occasionally with eulogistic re
marks about the Chicago ticket and plat
form.
Duluth is Mr. Towne's home, and his
local supporters, with several moie from
other parts of his district who came in on
excursion trains, turned out to-night to do
honor to the Nebraska man. A big crowd
was at the Union Depot when the candi
date's train arrived at 7 o'clock, and hearty
cheers followed Bryan and Towne on their
way through the streets to the St. Louis
Hotel. Immediately after sapper Mr.
Bryan started out to fulfill his Duluth
contracts.
Like the women of Minneapolis the
female supporters of Mr. Bryan in Duluth
bad arranged a meeting for their exclu
sive benefit. They said they wanted to
hear the nominees at some place where
men should not be admitted, and the local
reception committee secured the Lyceum
Theater for the purpose, so the 2500 or
more ladies who squeezed themselves into
tbe Lycedm to-night had Mr. Bryan all to
themselves.
A few newspaper workers of the male
persuasion were admitted and assigned to
places in the rear of the stage, while ladies
stood on their writing-tables to more ef
fectually screen them from the audience
in front. Incidentally Congressman
Towne was admitted, because he had to
introduce Mr. Bryan. A great waving of
handkerchiefs and clapping of hands and
feminine attempts at a cheer toot place
when Mr. Towne had made the presenta
tion. Mr. Bryan talked about the Demo
cratic side of the money question, and re
ceived more applause when be concluded.
Mrs. Bryan, wmo was there with Mrs.
Towne, divided interest with her husband,
The second meeting was in the carshed
of the local street railway company, a
great structure capable of holding between
12,000 and 15,000 people. It was parked
and jammed with male humanity when
Mr. Bryan arrived there at 9:;Â£5. His re
ception was of the heartiest and the cheer
ing on his appearance lasted several min
utes. L. C. Harris introduced Mr. Bryan,
who spoke in part as follows:
It gives me great pleasure to defend our
cause anywhere, but it give* me especial pleas
ure to defend that cause among people who,
like the people of Minneapolis, have laid
aside differences in minor questions and
joined in a supreme effort to wrest this Gov
ernment from tbe hands of those who would
make the people hewers of wood and haulers
oi water. [Applause.]
Mr. Bryan spoke in complimentary
terms to Charles A. Towne and John
Lind and said that Mr. Towne could bet
ter afford to be defeated than the people
could afford to allow his cause to suffer
defeat. Continuing he said:
I beg you to remember the responsibilities
which rest upon you in an hour like this and
leave no effort undone to give a majority in
tne House and a majority in the Senate, as
well as a President, all in favur of free coinage
at 16 to 1, without waiting for the aid or con
sent of any otber nation on earth. [A voice,
"And you won't veto it. will you?"] I will
not, but 1 waot you to have two-thirds, if pos
sible, in both Houses, So that if any change
should come to me and 1 should veto it, I
want you to have enough to nass it over my
veto. [Cheers.] But. my friends, you need
have no concern about my vetoing any meas
ure which is in harmony with the platform on
which I stand. 1 have been taught to believe
that platforms are guides to those ejected,
not merely the means by which one may be
elected. Yon may rest assured that I believe
in what is in that platform, and that no power
on earth can prevent my carrying out that
platform, so far as my ability may go. [Cheers.]
I desire to thank the laboring men of this
city for having completed the equipment, so
that I am now prepared to sign that bill when
ever it reaches me, without depending on
anybody else for pen or inkstand or ink. The
golden pen with the silver holder, the silver
Inkstand and the ink presented to-night shall
be preserved, and if, by the suffrages of my
counvrymen, I am placed in the highest office
within the gift of tbe people of all this world
these things shall be used for the purpose for
which they are intended, and I shall be glad
when the aeed is done that I am indebted,
not to tre financiers, not to the trusts, not to
corporations nor to syndicates, but to the
laboring men lor the equipment. [Cheers.]
The remainder of Mr. Bryan's speech
was on lines taken by him in previous
discourses on the money question.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan left here at 11
o'clock to-night in a special train, accom
panied by D. J. Campau of Michigan,
chairman of the Democratic National cam
paign committee; ex-Congressman Justin
R. Whitin-?, candidate for Lieutenant-
Governor of Michigan, and Mrs. Whiting ;
ex-Congressman Timothy B. Tarsney of
Detroit; George William Moore of Detroit,

Trie* to Mako It Appear That llryan's
Chances Are Good.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 13.â Senator Jones,
chairman of tbe Democratic National
Committee, characterized tbe table of the
probable electoral vote as' given out last
night by Senator Quay as a "gigantic
bluff." The chairman pointed out that of
all the States classed by Senator Quay as
doubtful only Tennessee and Virginia
have not complete fusion of Democrats,
Populists and silver Republicans. He
called attention to the State election in
August in Tennessee, where a Judge of
the Chancery Court of Appeals was
elected, in which the Democratic majority
was announced over 25,000, and added that
an examination of the vote cast by the
fusion parties in all the States classed as
doubtful would show the impossibility of
the Republicans carrying one of them.
The Senator also stated that of the States
classed for McKinley there was complete
fusion of all the silver forces in the fol
lowing: Illinois, Indiana, lowa, Kansas,
Keniucky,MicbÂ»gau, Minnesota.North Da
kota, Ohio, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
In thirty-two States "altogether complete
iusion bad been made of all the forces op
posed to tbe gold standard.
Chairman Jones gave to the United As
sociated Presses the lollowing table, show

Voes Aot Agree With Arehbithop Ireland
on the Chicago Platform.
DES MOINES, lowa, Oct. 13.â Rev. J. F.
Nugent, pastor of the Cathdlic Church of
the Visitation of this city, whose recent
pnblic address in favor of free silver and
the Chicago platform has attracted wide
attention in this city and elsewhere, to
night gave out an authorized interview in
reply to the recent letter of Archbishop
Ireland.
Father Nugent is well known in this
State, not only in church circles, but as a
lecturer and platform orator. His address
in support of Bryan and Sewall had con
siderable publicity given to It and be has
since received more than 200 requests to
make speeches, one of which came from
New York and anotber trom Denver.
Bourke I'ockran devoted much of his time
in his Dcs Moines address to answering
Father Nugent. In the course of his in
terview to-night Father Nugent said:
Archbishop Ireland said nothing new on the
financial question. He has played the same
music that the advocates of gold have been
playing since the campaign opened, but on
account of his exalted position it may be re
garded by some as an octave higher, yet it is
precisely the same thing. Archbishop Ireland
is without doubt an able and patriotic man,
but there are on the other side men of undis
puted loyalty and patriotism, and men whom
Archbishop Ireland will admit are far su
perior to him in economic learning.
The Archbishop seems to forget that while
we have a Federal constitution we have at the
same time a- dear and cherished doctrine
known as State sovereignty. Local affairs in
the platform mean those affairs which belong
exclusively to the State, and if the State has
not control over these affairs there can be no
such thing as State sovereignty. Tbe resolu
tion doea not deny to the Federal Government
any rights granted by the constitution, but
simply declares that there are rights which be
long to the province of State legislation. We
hold this resolution, therefore, to be absolutely
sound.
To the rich and powerful few it has
always been treason for the poor to say that
anything alls them. The best way, In my esti
mation, to prevent anarchy is to secure for the
producer an equitable share of that which he
produces.
DO NOT EXPECT TO 'BE ELECTED.
Generals Palmer and Huckner Striving

"We cannot give figures till after the elec
tion," said General Bnckner. "We are
working against both Bryan and McKin
ley."
The party left for the South at 11:40

RALEIGH, N. C, Oct. 13.â The Demo

Companies Recently Formed at the
Leadville Mines.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Oct. 13.â Governor

formed a subject for protracted and lively
debate.
Mr. Reed came as tbe personal repre
sentative of Mr. Watson, having spent
two days with him just before leaving the
South, and his signature to tha address
which explains and justifies joint Watson
and Sewali electoral tickets and appeals
to Populists to support them at the polls
is accepted as proof that peace has been
restored over this dissension in the com
mittee.
Senator Butler said that no action had
beer, taken by tbe committee relative to
Mr. Watson, and none would be; that he
would remain on the ticket. Another
meeting will be held to-morrow.
Following is the address prepared by
the committee:
To the People's Party Voters of the United States:
Your National Committee indulges in the
hope that the patriotic action of the People's
party in National convention in subordinating
the interests of party to the success of the
vital issues involved in this campaign would
be met by equally unselfish devotion to a com
mon interest on the part oi the Democratic
party, and that all the friends of silver could
present a solid front against the minions of
greed by supporting one ticket, the truly co
operative ticket, Bryan and Watson. But this
hope being disappointing there were but two
courses left, one of which must be adopted.
First, to run a straight Bryan and Watson
electoral ticket in every State, which, on ac
count of the failure of the Democratic party
to support this ticket would have effected the
same result in this campaign that would have
followed tbe nomination of a straight Populist
ticket at St. Louis, namely, the "election of
McKinley and the triumph of the gold stan
dard.
It is true that the Democratic party would be
responsible even to a greater extent than our
selves for such a result, but to permit evil to
triumph ou such grounds would convict us,
as well as them, of a lack of patriotism and a
narrow partisanship that would deservedly
forfeit to us the confidence of the American
people. Remember that two wrongs never
make a right.
When our devotion to the welfare of the
people falters because of any failure on the
part of the Democratic or any party, then in
deed will we have lowered our standard and
proven ourselves false to our own teachings
and repudiated our own motto of country first
and men and parties second.
The brave, enlightened voters who consti
tute the rank and nle of the People's party
are incapable of such base betrayal of their
country as would result from a division in the
ranks of those opposing the machinations of
the confederated money power of the two con
tinents against the homes and liberties of the
American people and would repudiate any
action on the part ot their leaders opposed to
united effort at this time as they repudiated'
the old parties for treachery to their inter
ests.
The other course left open to your commit
tee that was consistent with tbe action of the
convention in nominating Mr. Bryan was to
do everything in its power to unite the voters
of the country against McKinley and to over
come the obstacles and embarrassments
which, if the Democratic party had put the
cause first and the party second, we would not
have encountered.
This could be accomplished only by arrang
ing for a division of the electoral vote in every
Stale possible, seenring so many electors for
Bryan and Watson and conceding so many to
Bryan and Sewall. At the opening of the cam
paign this, under tbe circumstances, seemed
the wisest course for your committee and it is
clearer to-day than ever that it was the only
safe and wise course If our votes were to be
cast and made effective for the relief of an op-
f tressed and outraged people. Following this
me of policy your committee has arranged
electoral tickets in three-fourths of the States
and will do all in its power to make the same
arrangement in all of the States. By perfect
ing this arrangement and every sincere oppo
nent of tne gold standard giving loyal support
to these joint electoral tickets, the People's
party will not only secure In the Electoral Col
lege for Bryan and Watson several times as
many votes as we conld have possibly secured
by making a straight fight, but we will secure
the defeat of McKinley and the gold standard,
which should now be the greatest desire of

c very citizen who believes in the principles of
t rne Democracy.
By this arrangement we can unite a large
majority of the voters on our joint electoral
tickets; there/ore the only hope of the money
rower and trusts is to divide aDd conquer.
The .Republican managers and their Demo
cratic allies realize this and are putting forth
every effort to accomplish this end. They
have their emissaries on hand everywber*,
trying to prevent joint electoral tickets from
being arranged. Failing In this they try to nnd
Populists and silver Democrats who can be in
duced, on one pretext or another, to rebel
against the joint electoral ticket. The dagger
lies in the possibility of a certain portion oi
the rank and file of the People's party being
misled by so-called leaders, who, for reasons
best known to themselves, or for want of rea
son, are advising voters io rebel against the
joint electoral tickets and put up separate
electoral tickets or to withhold their support
from the joint electoral tickets.
Some of ihe Democrats of tbe revenue stripe
who are not yet weaned from the flesh pots of
EgyDt, but are sticklers for regularity and are
nominally supporting Mr. Bryan whiie
secretly and in every underhanded way are
trying to accomplish his dt feat, are advising
against the joint electoral tickets, and failing
in this then advise Democrats to scratch
People's party electors, and already a few so
called Populist leaders are advising the rank
and file oi our party to strike back by refusing to
support the Democratic leaders on the joint
electoral tickets. This is a trap set by the gold
bugs, who are rejoicing that a few honest men
have fallen into it. These reports to-day are
the only ones that buoy up the hopes of the
Republican managers, and the Democrats and
Populists who are thus engaged are doing
just what the gold men most desire.
Therefore we appeal to every Populist who
may have been misled by such mistaken or
false pleas of pretended loyalty to the People's
party into refusing to support such joint elec
toral tickets to stop and consider the results of
such conduct and refuse to be influenced by
either misguided or corrupt men.
The one and only hope of the Republican
party to win in this campaign and fasten the
god standard upon the country is the corrupt
use of an unlimited supply of money for
bribery, corruption and intimidation. Tha
patriotic action of the People's t>arty In form
ingand supporting these jointelectoral tickets
has shattered that hope. Already they are
alarmed at the impotency of a boodle cam
paign when all of the great moral forces of the
people are solidly united in defense of Ameri
can institutions. The revulson of the Ameri
can people against this boodl 3 campaign dur
ing the last ten days has so united them that
victory is now assured.
The People's party will be the party of the
future. The American people will recognize
it as the agency that saved the day when their
interests were at stake; the American people
will rally around its banner as the party to
contend against the enemy of good govern
ment In the future. Every man to his post
and the victory is won.

ARRAIGNS THE RAINES LAW.
Ex-Governor Flower of Mew York Addresses
the National Association of Retail
Liquor-Dealers.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Oct. 13.â The
fourth annual convention of the Natiortel
Association of Retail Liquor-dealers was
opened in this city this afternoon. The
report of the president, John Morrissey of
Syracuse, N. V., contained a review of the
work of previous conventions and defined
the objects of the association to be tha
mutual protection of the retail liquor
dealers in tbe pursuance of their legiti
mate business.
Ex-Governor Roswell P. Flower of New
York addressed the convention at the
afternoon s ssion. He signed the liquor
law of 1892, which he compared with tne
present unsatisfactory Raines law as fol
lows:
"The Raines law is an element of the
archaic class of legislation which has
created a host of anomalous laws with
which the statutory records are burdened.
It has failed to bring about the reforms
which it was claimed would be effected,
and instead of weeding out the less de
birable class of saloons it has only sufficed
to increase them.
'*It encouraged a class of persons who
could not procure a license under tbe old
law on account ot their lack of character
to appiy for a liquor tax certificate under
the Raines law. Many of these people
conduct fake hotels or places of doubtful
respectability, and have forced hundreds
of the poorer but more respectable class
of saloon-keepers out of existence. I be
lieve in tne widest personal liberty con
sistent with good government, and in ex
tending tbe constitutional rights of
liberty of person and goods to every per
son in so far as it does not prejudice the
rights of others."

There Is No Danger of His

Spanish General Castellano Re
ports Having Routed the
Insurgents.
SIIGE OF CACCOBBO KAISED.
In Many Sections of Cuba There Is
Great Misery Among the
Inhabitants.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 13.â Rumors were
in circulation here on Saturday that
Captain-General Weyler had gone or was
about to go to Pinar del Rio. These
rumors "were absolutely without founda
tion as General Weyler has not left
Havana, and it is not known that it is his
intention to do so at present.
Tne rebel leaÂ«ler, Maria Rodriguez, has
been wounded in an engagement upon the.
ranch Junceo, near Esperanza, with the
Spanish forces under the command of
General Aldaves.
General Castellano has reported to the
Government that he has raised the sies;e
of Cascorro, Camaguay, routing the rebels
after sixteen engagements on October 4
and 5. Tne rebel forces numbered 5000
men, under the command of Maximo
Gomez, Calixto Garcia and other leader?.
The Spanish troops numbered 1800 in
fantry and 300 cavalry. They had two
pieces of artillery. October 6 the troops
entered Cascorro and began to repair the
damage caused by the fire of the rebels.
The insurgents fired 219 grape shots dur
ing the thirteen days of the siege.
On October 7 the Spanish forces had an
engagement with the rebels on the Des
ruayo estate. The lighting lasted four
hours and resulted in the rout of the
rebels. The rebel losses are unknown,
but are believed to be heavy. The Span
ish lost five killed, including two officers.
Three officers and fifteen privates were
wounded.
General Avolar, commander of the
Artemisa Trocha, has improved upon
"Weyler's bank bill edict. He has issued
an order forbidding merchants along the
military line to alter tbe price of goods.
Pernicious fevers are scourging Santiago
de Cuba. The mortality in September was
nearly 500. against 200 births. Smallpox
is decreasing.
The families in the interior towns are
terror-stricken with the renewal of Wey
ler's edict ordering that the wives and
children of insurgents who may attack
any city or town be expelled to another
province. This measure constitutes the
greatest outrage upon the Cubans. It aims
at the corruption of families. Unscrupu
lous Spanish officers are well aware of the
terrinie power they can wield, and do not
hesitate to threaten women where the en
forcement of the edict is concerned,
The correspondent at Santa Clara writes:
The Spanish Colonel Rodriguez was
thought to be superior to most of his col
leagues. He had always acted humanely
and was respected by all. But a few days
ago he caused the arrest of Cheche Capote,
Jose Maria Ceballos, CamiHo Rodriguez
and their children, and other persons to
the number of seventeen, and all were
hacked to pieces with machetes. The re
sult of this was that many peaceable men
have joined the insurgents.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 13.â The Her
ald's special from Gibaria, via Key West,
say 8: The Herald's correspondent in Cuba
reports the landing of a new filibustering
expedition in Marive, in Eastern Cuba. It
is understood the party brought 100,000
rifles and a great store of war munitions.
The men disembarked from a Haytian
schooner between two Spanish forts. Tie
war material was all transferred into the
interior before any alarm was raised.
Sucn is the state of suffering among the
poorer classes in Baracoa that the local
Spanish commandant is now permitting
women and children to go through the
Government lines to beg food in the rebel
camps. More than 300 passes for this pur
pose ere being issued daily. The women
are subjected to rigid search as they go
outside of the walls of the town to prevent
any medicines being taken to the insur
gents and also upon their return for corre
spondence.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 13.â W.
A. Bisbee. who owns the steamer Daunt
less, said to-day that the statements about
his vessel going on a filibustering expe
dition were incorrect. The Dauntless,
said Mr. Bisbee, ig now engaged in legiti
mate business and she can be brought to
Jactsonville within forty-eight hours if
the Government officers desire. "But of
course," he added, "I shall demand in
demnity for tbe time she loses. lam not
th â¢ filibuster some of the newspapers
make me out to be, and while lam heart
ily in sympathy with the Cuban cause, I
am a law-abiding citizen and regre* to see
so much buncombe jiublicity given my
tujr and myself. The Dauntless is not
takingr any chances and there are too
many of Uncle Sam's ships of war around
for me to jeopardize my boat, which is
now attending strictly to business."

GERM AN SOCIALISTS.
They Engage in Disputes Over Xews

GOTHA, Germany, Oct. 13.â At to-day's
sitting of the congress of the German So
cialist party at Sieblichen, Herren Schu
meier of Vienna and Vliegen of Holland
were received as guests. A lively discus
sion took place regarding the paper, Neve
Welt, Herren Frohmeand Molkenbuhr at
tacking the journal as misrepresenting
German socialism. Herren Sctioenlauk
and SchreckÃ addressed the congress in
defense of the paper and the remarks of
the speakers led up to a criticism of Herr
Liebknecht's editorship of the Vorwaerts,
the leading organ of the Socialists, it hav
ing been* alleged by some of the editors
employed on that journal that Herr
.Liebknecht was oftener absent than pres
ient at the offices of that journal, yet he
â  assumed to dictate and criticize with an
f offensive degree of exaction the work of
the editors who were attentive to their
duties.
Herr Liebknecht took the floor and in a
long speech explained that his absence
from the offices of the Vorwaerts and
from Berlin as well had always been in
connection with his business as Â»n Â»gi
tator in the cause of social democracy,
which prevented him from being chief
editor of the paper in the ordinary sense
of the term.

LIMPING OVER THE OCEAN
Slow Time Made by the Crip
pled Paris in the Trip to
Southampton.
It is Believed That the B;g Steamship
Has Safely Weathered the
Recent Gales.
NEW YORK, N. f ., Oct. 13.â The steam
ship Paris, which is limping toward Soutn
hampton under her port screw, the other
having been fractured, was spoken by the
Red Star liner Kensington from Ant
werp for this port, which arrived at mid
night Saturday night. When the Paris
was abeam the Kensington she signaled,
"We are the Paris, American line." The
Kensington passed the Paris in latitude
44 deg. 38 mm. and longitude 54 deg. 18
mm. She was then just eighty-four hours
out of port and had proceeded about 900
miles in that time. Her position was due
south of Cape Race and St. John, N. F.,
and due east of Halifax and Sable island.
The loss of half of tbe propelling power
of the vessel should reduce her speed to
about fifteen knots per hour, but a compu
tation based upon the distance traveled
shows she has made only little over nine
knots an hour. The Paris has undoubt
edly met and weathered the gale that has
been devastating our coast and that
proDfibly accounts for the poor time she
has made. The vessel had yet to go 2100
miles. At tbe rate of nine miles per hour
it would take her until next Tuesday to
steam from where she was sighted by the
Kensington to Southampton. Steamship
men, however, believe the Paris will in
crease her speed several knots if tne
weather moderates, and will get into
Southampton by Sunday.

Banners.
Live Issues Discussed by Senator
Perkins and Colonel

VISITORS CROWD THE TOWN.
Not Since the Native Sons' Conven

Strangers.
SAN LUIB OBISPO, Cal., Oct. 13.â
Senator Perkins and Colonel Jackson ar
rived this morning from Lompoc, where
they spoke last evening. They were met
at the depot by a number of Republicans,
who escorted them to a hotel, where they
were visited during the day by many rep
resentative citizens.
A large number of people arrived on an
excursion train at 5 o'clock this afternoon
from the northern part of the county,
while a larger delegation arrived from the
southern towns of Arroyo Grande, Nipomo
and Santa Maria at 7:30 and was met by
the McKinley and Hobart Uniformed
Guards and escorted to the Republican
headquarters. There a parade was
formed and marched to the pavilion, amid
a constant display of fireworks. The line
of torches strwtched out for clocks. The
procession was made up of Republican
clubs from all over the county, accompa
nied by three bands.
The pavilion was crowded to the doors
and many were turned away. Senator
Perkins was in good voice and the telling
points of his speech were loudly cheered.
The meeting was enlivened by music by
the band, the Edna ouintet of young
ladies and a male quartet. Colonel Jack
son's remarks were well received.

DESERTS THE DEMOCRACY.
A Leading French Xewspaper Goes Over
t-o Protection's Champion.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 13.â The
leading French newspaper of this City,
which has been Democratic from the start,
has come out for peace, protection, pros
perity and the Republican ticket. It a
late issue the following appeared in its
columns:
Ever since it was founded l'Union Nouvelle
has sided with the Democratic party, and in
doing so it has been In accord with the senti
ments of the great majority of the French in
Bouthern California. Four years ago the Demo
crats (and Mr. Bryan was already one of their
orators) told us tnat if you elect Mr. Cleveland
and a Democratic Congress a new tariff will
be made and prosperity will be general. The
people believed these promises, and the party
immediately passed a tariff law which has
ruined the industries of the country.
The French of Southern and Central Cali
fornia, where the raising of cattle and sheep
wÂ»s followed by them on a great scale, have
suffered more severely than all others whose
industries have been strangled without grace
or mercy, and we can only join our cries of
malediction to those of other sufferers. Never
theless, in tbe midst of this ruin Mr. Bryan
rises up and cries:
"It Is not necessary to discuss at tnis mo
ment the tariff question."
If it is not necessary to discuss it now, when
will it present itself? Will it be when no
more of the industries are left standing?
When failures and financial heresies wi.l
have killed confidence, destroyed the National
credit und reduced the country to the finan
cial condition of Chiua and of the republics of
South America?
As for us we do not nesitate to declare that
we repudiate the free-trade policy of the Dem
cratic party, and that we rally to the support
of tho Republican party, which has for its aim
the re-establishing ot favorable tariffs, the
saving of the industries of the country and
the bringing back of prosperity.
UTTLE Y AT SANTA CRUZ.
Ihe Free-Silver Orator Utters a Plea for
Equal Suffrage.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. 13.â Hon. A.
J. Uttley of Los Angeles, candidate for
Superior Judge on the Populist ticket of
that county, addressed an audience that
filled the seating capacity of the Y. M. C.
A. Hall to-night. Mr. Uttley has been
speaking for free silver for the past sixty
days in this State. He said all bis audi
ences had been largely composed of
women, which he held to be an indication
that they were giving attention very
properly to political and economic ques
tions. When this Government was formed,
he said, there were four classes ;hat could
not vote âIndians, negroes, idiots and
women. The exception had been removed
as to Indians and negroes, and within the
past twenty-five years he thought it mani
fest that idiots bad been voting. Only the
women were left without the franchise,
and in this State, he believed, they would
be given the voting privilege by a great
majority.

COMSTOCK'S SAN
JOSE ESCAPADES
Mrs. Martin Brings Suit
for the Recovery of
Her Diamonds.
Claims They Were Obtained by
Fraud by the Gay Young
Adventurer.
PLACED BY HIM IN PAWN.
The Friend Who Rescued the Jewels
From Uncle's Place Asked to
G.ve Them Up
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 13.â A suit grow
ing out of the escapades of Charles M.
Comstock, a society young man of San
Francisco, a couple of years ago, began in
Judge .^origan's court this morning. The
action is brought by Caroline Colton
Martin of San Francisco against Charles
A. Armstrong of this city to recover pos
session ol $2500 worth of diamond jewelry.
Comstock, who had gained Mrs. Mar
tin's confidence, represented to her that
her lawyers had iustructed him to secure
some $6000 worth of diamonds she had so
that they might be deposited in a bank as
collateral security to obtain money with
which to pay a street assessment. Mrs.
Martin turned her jewels over to Com
stock and ihe latter started out to enjoy
life.
Comstock, who has many rich relatives
in the East (among them General Com
stock of New York), made many visits to
this city. He stopped at the Vendome
and moved in polite society. He had all
kinds of diamonds and, money to burn
when he came here, but tbe money was
soon consumed and hâ¬ borrowed promis
cuously from his friends. It was at this
time that he got a loan of $250 from Arm
strong and gave as security a ticket on a
pawnbroker in San Francisco for $2500
worth of pledged diamonds.
Armstrong took up the iewelry by pay
ing $1100 more to the young man, and the
latter then went to New York. It then
developed that Comstock had secured the
jewelry from Mrs. Martin npon false pre
tenses. Mrs. Martin some time ago re
covered in San Francisco the balance of
the jewels obtained from her by Comstock.

GREAT DANGER TO PROPERTY
Belief That Incendiaries Are at Work
on the Sierra Madre
Slopes.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. 13.â Great ex
citement prevailed here to-day over the
fresh impetus given tbe Sierra Madre
fires by a fierce, wind which sprung up
about midnight. Twelve men had nearly
controlled the fire which startea at the
head of Saucer Canyon last night by back
firing and trenching, but the blaze was
swept into the thick brush of Millard
Canyon and Negro Canyon, rolling vol
umes of smoke into the valley. For some
hours tiiis morning the men were in great
danger. One- of the party was cut off from
the others by the flames and made his
way to Pasadena with his hands and arms
badly burned.
Pasadena is enveloped in smoke and
falling ashes are scattered everywhere.
The roar from the fire was plainly heard
during the night at J. W. Hughes' ranch
place, the Highlands, some six miles
away, and great alarm is felt, as the wind
is rising.
Calvin W. Brown, receiver of the Mount
Lowe Railway, sent up a crew of twenty
men and the Lake Vineyard Land and
Water Company sent fifteen to fight the
fire. Mayor Hartweli left Pasadena at 5
a. m. with a party of volunteers, and the
latest reports from the scene indicate that
good work is being done, but more help is
wanted.
This fire is not apparently consequent
upon the fires on Browns Mountains,
thought to be wholly extinguished on
Saturday, and rumors are credited that the
hres are of incendiary origin, started for
the purpose of creating work by men sent
to put out other fires. Great indignation
is felt over the situation and should re
ports be verified summary justice will be
meted out.
The flames can be plainly seen from all
points in Pasadena. The fire in Millards
Canyon is less than a half mile distant
from the Mount Lowe railway track to
Alpine tavern. The danger to "property is
greater than at any time heretofore. One
hundred men are fighting the fire.
CONFLAGRATION NEAR LODI.
Acres of Tules on the Cross Ranch Swept
by Flames.
LODI, Cal., Oct. 13.â Fire started on
Saturday in the tules on the ranch owned
by Dr. Cross of Stockton, and a thirty
acre tract has already been burned over.
Men were sent from Stockton to right the
tire, but there is no water at hand for their
use. The soil being of peat formation the
fire may burn underground and come to
the surface a mile away. Th* fire fighters
are trying to dig a trench around the
burning ground down to the water.
Incendiary Fire at Poso.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Oct. 13.â
News has been received of the burning of
Quintano Bros.' store at Poso, tnirty

fishermen. He will be returned to the

THE MYSTERY OF
POINT LOBOS PARK
Count yon Ballestrem's Hut
Yields Another Bit of
Evidence.
Strange Disappearance of a Clock
Which Has a Bearing on
the Case.
BURIAL OF THE NOBLEMAN.
His Body Interred in a Pauper's
Grave in a Monterey
C.metery.
MONTEREY, Cal., Oct. 13. â Count
Wolfgang yon Ballestrem, who was killed
at Point Lobos Sunday night during a
scuffle with Charles Ablger of San Fran
cisco, was buiied this morning, services
being held at the San Carlo 3 Catholic
church. Father R. M. Mestres officiated.
Abiger, his bosom friend and companion,
did not attend. The pallbearers were
Judge Michaelis, Judge Cless, H. Bach, F.
Doering, William Hannon and J. W.
B&gby. Father Mestres said mass for the
Count, and lie was buried in the paupers'
cemetery of the Catholic church. The
funeral was well attended, many Germans
who knew the Count following his body to
tbe grave. His Point Lobos Park and
Carmel Valley acquaintances were also at
the funeral to-day.
The mystery which surrounds the
death cf Count Ballestrem thickens in
stead of clearing away. There was a
cloct in his hut on Port Lobos before he
was killed, but it cannot now be found,
and it was not in the hut the morning
after the tragedy. Charles Abiger
stated that there was no way of telling
the time when tbe shooting occurred,
but he believed it was about 6:30 o'clock.
Those who visited the hut and know of
the clock believe that there was some
way of telling the time, and that the dis
appearance of the clock after the killing
is significant. That slip of paper found
pinned to the wall with "B died at 11:30"
written upon it is also being borne in
mind by those who disagree with the
Coroner's jury. It is believed that an
arrest will be made when the Grand Jury
meets if Abiger is still in this part of the
country.
Abiger would not say, however, this
morning what he proposed to do â whetner
to go to San Francisco or New York, or to
remain in Monterey. He did say he would
never enter that hut again as long as be
lived. He seems very downhearted and
despondent.
Judge Michaelis, the best friend of Bal
lestrem in Monterey, claims he possesses
partnership papers "with the Count,where
by they were to go in together in selling
property at Carmelito, a town site about
seven miles down the coast and adjoining
the Point Lobos property. The Count
was expecting a remittance of $1200 next
week from his bister in Germany with
which to good ahead in the deal.
BIG GAME AT MONTEREY.
Three What* Taken by Hunters Outside
the Heads.
MONTEREY, Cal., Oct. 13.â The Mon
terey Whaling Company has three whales
as its catch for to-day. One was shot yes
terday, but was not towed in until this
afternoon. When Captain Pedro and his
crew went out early this morning to brirg
it in they saw two other whales off the
heads and about four miles from where
they shot the first. They set sail and
after a lively cha3e succeeded in harpoon
ing one. The other whale came up near
the second boat anil they siiot it with a
bomb, killing it instantly. The first whale
carried the boat some distance before they
were able to shoot it.
The smallest whale was becched to
night. It is about 35 feet long, but the
two anchored outside are 65 and 80 feet in
length respectively.

MONTEREY, Cal., Oct. 13.â The sec

Church opened with a sermon at early
morning mass by Father Clark. His sub
ject was, ''Confession and How to Make
It Good," and many doctrinal arguments
were broucht strongly forward. In the
evening at 8 o'clock the instruction period
was taken up by Father Clark in a disser
tation upon "Faith and Its Source." He
said that faith could not be drawn wholly
from the Bible, but must have its true
source in the church, because the church,
beinp founded by Christ, antedated the
compilation of the Bible some years and
was tberefore^lthe more reliable source
lrom which to derive faith.
At the later service the main lecture of
â¦he aay was delivered by Father Dohertv.
His subject was "Sin." He dealt chiefly
with ita evil effects upon those among
wbom sin is committed. He explained at
some length the difference in degree be
tween mortal sins and others.
SAVING THE UM.4.TILLA.
The Steamship Will Be Towed to a Dry â 
dock To-JfaÂ».
PORT TOWNBEND, Wash., Oct. 13.â
The big pumps aboard the half-sunken
steamer Umatilla worked to perfection
this morning, &nd as a consequence the
wreckers found it possible to move the
vessel shoreward over 150 feet, thus plac
ing it in a position to be easy of access to
divers and repairer?, who will complete
the work of patchinz the hull, that the
water may be entirely pumped -out. Here
tofore it had been impossible to make
much progress on the vessel owing to the
fact that several of the punctures were in
places that could not be reached by the
workmen. This obstacle has now been
overcome. By to-morrow morning the
vessel will be in condition to be towed to
adrydock.

VICEROY LI'S REAL MISSION.
Crossed the Ocean to Gain Consent to an
Increase of Chinese Import
Duties.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 13. â Robert
Sbewan, at the head of one of Hongkong's
great exporting firms, is in this city en
route to New York, and thence to his
former home in England.
"Li Hung Chang," Mr. Shewan said, in
discussine Chinese men and affairs, "suc
ceeded right well in the concealment of the
chief object of his round-the-world tour,
which in reality was to wire the consent
of foreign powers to an increase of Chinese
import duties, which are fixed by treaty.
"The Chinese Government has now a big
war debt on its shoulders, and increased
revenues must be received so as to pay in
terest and other charges.
â 'In this Li accomplished his purpose
fairly well, such permission in many in
stances having been granted, the only
condition imposed being that China con
sent to great internal improvements and
the application of more modern methods."
Li Hung Chang, Mr. Shewan says, is
meeting with much opposition at the
hands of his great political rival, Chang
Chik Tune, Viceroy for the provinces sur
rounding Hangkow and Woo Chong.
The former favors the importation of
foreign capital for railroad Building, while
Chang Chik Tung insists that Chinese
railroads shall be built of rails manu
factured in China.
Under such conditions he has secured
Government aid toward building a railroad
over 100 miles long, extending from Han
kow to Pekin. .Chang Chik Tung, Shewan
stated, is more powerful with the masses
of China than is tbe renowned Li Hung
Chang, whose great power, he says, is de
rived through the favor of the Empress
Dowager. _______^^_^
RACING TO COWLITZ PASS
Rival Railroads in Washington
Competing for Future
Patronage.
Each Seeks to Beat the Other in
the Construction of a
Roadb d
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 13.â Contractor
Lyndell to-day began grading with a
dozen teams for an extension of the
Tacoma and Lake Park Railroad, from
Lake Park, fifteen miles south of Tacoma,
to the Columbia River, through Cowlitz
Pass.
President Holmes of the Puget Sound,
Mount Tacoma and Eastern Railway, to
day left for the foothills of Mount Tacoma
to make a final examination of the coun
try through which his road, now eight
miles long, is to be extended. He is ac
companied by Baron de Courtier of Paris,
representing European capitalists, who
will furnish $3,000,000 to build and equip
the line.
The&e are the outward evidences of
what appears likely to become a hotly
contested railroad race to Cowlitz Pass
through the richest timber belt and the
largest coalfields of the State. Another
objective point is the Pacific forestry re
serve on the western side of Mount Ta
coma, which contains scenery rivaling
that of the Yellowstone and the Yosemite.
The reserve is slightly to the eastward of
the direct route to Cowlitz Pass and it is
probable that the road will touch it either
by main line or spurs.
Colonel Bailey, president of the Lake
Park road, is a New Yorker. He is accom
panied here by Mr. Arms, a prominent
New York railroad man, George Clark and
Mr. Evans, representing the St. Louis
capitalists who are furnishin? money for
the extension. They have examined th^
timber and coal resources and made favor
able reports. The commencement of
grading now gives Bailey's road consider
able start over competitors, but the
Tacoma and Eastern people have an ad
vantage in having secured rights of way
for the greater distance.
It is probable that they will start con
struction before November, since Baron
de Courtier la quoted in the papers as
stating that his people will invest no more
money in the United States till after the
election, and then only in the event of
McKinley's election.
The greatest interest will be taken in the
prospective race for Cowlitz Pass, since
railroad engineers agree that the next
transcontinental road to build to the
Northwest must probably came through
this pass. It is believed the road that
occupies the pass first will ultimately con
nect with the Burlington.
Trouble at Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct 13.â Considerable
feeling has been stirred up here in A. P. A.
and Catholic circles by the arrest and trial
of C. F. Dunne on a charge of drunken
ness. He was at an A. P. A. meeting on
Friday night when Ryaa spoke, and the
police arrested him, alleging that he dis
turbed the meeting, but charged him with
drunkenness. Attorney Grimm, who is
secretary of the Republican Committee,
interested himself in the case, having been
an eye-witness, and to-day Police Judge
Rendon discharged Dunne. Police Captain
Simpson has been arrested on a charge of
battery in connection with Dunne's arrest.
The feeling developed to-day, when
A. P. A. members of tbe Republican party
made complaints asking that Grimm be
displaced as secretary of the Central Com
mittee. Chairman Nelson, made peace, but
considerable bitterness exists.

of Football.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
13. â Stanford freshmen this afternoon met
an outside team for the first time this sea
son. It was the Belmont School eleven â
a strong aggregation of promising young
players. There had been a great desire on
the part of students to see the freshmen
play a match game in order that they
might gain some idea of the merit of the
team which is to line up against the
Berkeley freshmen a month from the
present time. In its first game here the
freshman team played unexpectedly good
ball, defeating the sophomores, who had
been looked upon up to that time as prob
able champions. In its second game
against the seniors the play of '00's eleven
was very ragged and the team was de
feated, but this was due in part to the ab
sence oi two or three cf the freshmen's
best players and the heavy line of the
seniors.
A very larjre crowd was, therefore, on
hand to witness the game this afternoon,
and as Belmont brought with them a
large contingent to "root" for their team
and the freshmen were on hand to "root"
for their representatives the game as
sumed almost a championship character.
Co-eds were out in force and faculty mem
bers were on hand with their wives and
families.
The team* were of about the same
weie-ht and build, Stanford's team this
year being quite light In the line. The
lineup was as follows :
Stanford Freshmen. Position. Belmonts.
Bun tin Center Broome
Burnett R. Guard It Hinds
Hall ii. NuÂ»rd R Caland
Ferris R. Tacfcle L Reid
Rusk L. Tackle R Albertnon
McOllvray R. KndL Be-kley
McLaine I* End R Cooper
Clemmlni Quartertnck Roberts
Diagles R. Half L More
Daly I* Half R Wadaworth
Lanagan Fullback Canon
This was not the regular freshmen line
up. Captain Murphy not playing, and
Madden and Seawrieht not going on at
the first lineup. Madden went in, how
ever, in place of McLaine at end, and Lanagan
was retired because of injuries at the begin
ning of the second hslf.
Belmont had the ball for the kickoS for 40
yards. Olemmins running the ball bacfc 13
yards before tackled. The Belraonts soon ob
tained the ball on a fumble, and in successive
buots by ihe backs made several good gains.
The freshmen got the ball and mude 10 yards
before being forced to punt. The kick wan
promptly returned, so no gain resulted. The
freshmen seemed able to find a number of
holes in the opposing line, and gradually
worked the ball toward the cen'er of the field.
Clemmins played a remarkably strong game
at this point both in interference and tackiine,
but had some trouble in making fast passes.
After a fake kick and no ball, the Belmont
fullback kicked for 30 yards. The freshmen .
however, bucked the ball back for 15 yards,
and Biggies made a long run for 10 yards, fol
lowed by McGilvray and McLaine with long
end runs.
Here the Belmonts braced up and took the
ball on downs, but at once kicked for 30
yards. The freshmen backs worked the ball
back s'.owly, but Lanagan was forced to kick
for 30 yards. The ball was fumbled by
Carson, and Rusk fell on it, but the ball was
lost before much gain resulted, and Carson
made a fine 15-yard end run on a fake kick,
Dlggles making the tackle.
Belmont lost the ball on an offside play and
the Stanford freshmen in halfback piays
gained 10 yards. Lanagan added 4 yards
more and Diggles an eqnal number. The
sphere was now on Belmont's 5-yard line
and the excitement was intense. Diggler
took the ball to carry it across the line, but it
was fumbled and rolled over of its own
motion. Quick as a Sash More picked it up
and forced his way back inside the goal line,
preventing any score for the freshmen. Carson
kicked the bill out of danger and the first
half was ended.
Second halfâ The freshmen took the ball and
kicked off for 30 yards. They continued
bucking tactics on gaining possession of the
ball through the fumble of Belmont, and made
a touchdown on the long-end run of McGilvray.
Score: 4âO, in favor of the freshmen.
The Belmonts kicked off for 35 yards, the
freshmen gaining 10 yards on bucks and 20
yards on Diggles' long pnnt. Wads worth
made a long gain for the Belmonts through
the f rishmen line, and More added 6 yards on
another buck. WadÂ«worth made a 15-yard
end run and the ball was now on Stanford's
10-yard line, vrhere the freshmen gained the
ball. McGilvray immediately carried the ball
around the end for 10 yards, and Diggles made
4 more-around the other end. Diggles punted
for 20 yards, but Carson ran the ball back the
entire distance before being tackled, and the
freshmen were again fighting near their own
goal.
Two successive backs by Belmont backs took
the ball to the freshmen 10-yard line, where
they gained possession of the pigskin. Buck
ing gav<) no ground, but Diggles made a 10
--yard gain, and no gains resulting on buck,
Belmont took the ball.
The ball was given to Wadsworth and, aided
by line interference, he made a pretty end run
for a touchdown, and Carson failed to kick the
goal. Score, 4 â 4.
Stanford kicked off for 20 yaids and Wads
worth took the ball, and, without being
tackled once, never stopped running till the
ball was placed between Stanford's goal posts.
1 Carson kicked the goal. Score, 10 to 4in favor
of Belmont.
Again Stanford kicked off and Wadsworth
ran the dbII back 10 yards, when Clemmins
downed him, and the game ended.

SANTA BARBARA CITIGATION
Citizen* fail to Prevent Changes in Su
pervisorial District Boundaries.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 13.â The
attempt of a number of Santa Barbara
citizens to prevent the Supervisorial dis
trict boundary change recently ordered by
the Board of Supervisors ended in failure
to-day. Judge Campbell of San Bernardino
decided adversely the suit of Meigs vs.
County Clerk Doyle, on the Round of lack
of jurisdiction. The case has excited
much interest, for the reason that it
involved the right of a body of officials to
arbitrarily change the boundary of the
very districts in which they are to run for
re-election, in this case ignoring the rule
of population division by subtracting from
the less populous and adding to the
thickly settled district. The case will be
appealed.

HELEN KELLER A WONDER.
Although Blind, Deaf and taatelets Alie
Will Entvr Harvard.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 13.â A Boston
special says that Helen Keller, blind, deaf,
.tasteless, has passed the Harvard exam
ination with credit. She bad no special
preparation and the examiners did not
know who she was. She will enter Rad
cliffe (Harvard) at a younger age than
most freshmen.
Helen Keller was born in Alabama in
i .â ,â¢â , her father being a Confederate
officer. No attempt at education wa3 made
for the first seven years of her life. It
was when about eight years old that she
lost all her senses but that of touch. In
1887 she was taken to the Perkins School
for tbe Blind in Boston and placed under
thÂ« care of Miss Sullivan, whodevoted her
life to the education or the little unfor
tunate. Three years later she had learned
to articulate and was progressing with a
rapidity undreamed of by those who had
to do with children in the possession of
their full faculties. In 1894 she was re
moved to the Wright Hamerson School
in this city, refusing to become an inmate
of a school built in London and named
after her.
Soon after she became apt in interpret
ing the speech of others by feeling their
lips, and now is able to communicate with
any one within reach ol her sensitive
finger tips.

years old, jumped over tbe Niagara Falls.

hat and set the hat on the stone wall.

was a cinnamon brown, sprang upon the
wall and jumped into the river. He went
over the falls instantly, for he struck near
the brink. The hat contained 40 cents.

HOLD-UP HEAR UINTAH,
Two Outlaws Rob a Union
Pacific Train in Weber
Canyon, Utah.
The News Carried to a Station by
the Engineer, Who Rin
From the Scene.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Oct. 14. â The
Union Pacific train, due here at 3:15
o'clock this (Wednesday) morning, was
held up a short distance east of Uintah,
near the mouth of Weber Canyon and
about eight miles from Ogden.
It is supposed that two men did the
work, but just how much booty they got
is not known.
The engineer, who left the train, ran
ahead to Uintah and telegraphed in the
bare facts.
He believes, however, from the conver
sation of the men as they went through
the train that the men meant to blow up
the express car with dynamite.
A train was made up at Ogden and sent
to the scene of the robbery, and orders
were given to organize a posse and run the
robbers down.

She was engaged by Mr. Appleton, my man

That she should figure as corespondent in my

KELLY ACQUITTED.
Kesult of the Trial for the Murder of
Private Quinn at Fort
Mason.
James Kelly was yesterday acquitted of
the charge of murdering Joseph E. Quinn,
whom he killed by cutting his jueular
with a razor on the evening of July 10 last.
Both Kelly and his victim were United
States soldiers, stationed at Fort Mason.
As the result of a free fight in which
a number of men were engaged, Quinn
was slain. No one saw Kelly cut Quinn,
but he acknowledges having done so.
j*fter the affray he was found in his
bunk, fully dressed and with his hands
covered with fresh blood. The weapon
with which the deed was accomplished
was subsequently found near the spot
where Quinn fell.
All day yesterday wa3 consumed by the
arguments of the lawyers. Prosecuting
Attorney Hinkle claimed that the killing
of Quinn was cold-blooded, premeditated
murder. He said that after the fight be
tween Kelly and his victim Quinn turned
to go away, and that Kelly lollowed him
and struck him with, the razor from
behind.
He also made a strong point of the fact
that for three months after the finding of
the knife, said to belong to Quinn, its
existence was not reported to the civil
authorities. He asked for a verdict of
murder in the first degree.
The prisoner's legal representatives con
tended that their client wa3 only defend
ing himself when he struck the fatal
blow. They said that Quinn, a quarrel
some bully, kniie in hand, was seeKing an
opening in order to strike Kelly, and that
the latter had to use his weapon to save
his life. They pleaded for an acquittal.
The case went to the jury at 4 p..m., and
shortly before 10 o'clock last night they
returned with a verdict of not guilty.
Took His Own Life.
Despondent through losing his position
and without prospects of securing an
other, Daniel T. Stevens, 29 year 3of age,
a clerk by occupation, committed suicide
by shooting himself in the head in his
room. 709 Ellis street, last evening.
He died at 7:30 o'clock. The Coroner
was notified and the body was sent to the
Morgue. Stevens' sister was summoned
shortly after the young man shot himself,
but sue arrived too late to see her brother
alive.
Last Night's Fires.
An alarm was sounded from box 135 at 8 :30
o'clock last evening for a blaze in a frame
building, 1326 Polk street, owned by Mrs.
Bergstein and occupied by T. Rock, saddler
and harness dealer. The damage was about
$100 and was caused by rats eating matches.
The loss is covered by insurance.
The alarm from box 53 at 8 p. m. was for a
fire In a quantity of hay on a wharf at tbe foot
of Third street. The damage amounted to
$200.

' Stockton, Market and Ellis Sts.JUDGE MAGUIRE TO
THE WORKINGMAN
Government by Injunction
Is Eloquently De
nounced.
The Free-Silver Issue Was Also
Discussed at Some
Length.
BANKERS AS MONEY USERS-
Fonr Purposes to Which They Give
Their Attentionâ A Cotton
Standard Suggested.
Hon. James G. Maguire, Democratic
nominee for Congressman in the Fourth
Congressional District, addressed his con
stituents on the issues of the campaign at
Union Hall, on Howard street, last night.
The meeting was called under the
auspices of the Labor S:lver Organization
of San Francisco, and in front of the hall
was a big banner setting forth an ardent
belief in the doctrine of free coinage of
ver and the truth that employers have
â¢ru right to hamper or assume to control
the consciences of employes.
Above the rostrum was a streamer bear
ing the name of W. J. Bryan, beneath
â¢which was the legend:
LABOR :
Is ieb Leteb That :
Movks the World. ;
The meeting was large, enthusiastic and
demonstrative, every point made by the
speakers being greeted with applause.
W. J. Lawlor, chairman of the Cali
fornia Silver Campaign Committee, called
the meeting to order with the remark that
some people had snid that tbe laboring
men of the country were deserting the
Democratic party, and be and his asso
ciates desire to show that this is not true.
He said: "Union Hali has been rented by
our organization aud will be placed at the
disposal of the laboring classes during
the remaindar of the campaign, thus giv
ing them an opportunity to discuss the
status of public affairs in their own way
and to iheir own saiisiaction."
P. H. McCarthy, a representative work
ing-man, a carpenter by trade, was intro
duced as chairman of the evening and
kept his hearers laughing lor half an hour
by his sarcastic expressions of sympathy
for Mark Hanna in his efforts to improve
the condition of the laboring classes.
Tie speaker was interrupted by the ap
pearance of two marching campaign ol am,
who came into the hall bearing banners
and torches, preceded by a noisy drum
corps.
After declaring that California once
kf p: Mr. Hanna's miners from starving,
Mr. McCartny introduced Judge Maguire,
while the band played "Hail to the
Chief." and the audience rose to him in
greeting.
Judge Maguire opened bis address with
a gJoTvinjc tribute to the good works of
wise and judicious labor organizations.
He said that he had at all times given aid
ko tbe efforts of the workingmen ol the I
M ntry, organized and unorganized, in the j
e'i"ugKle to improve the condition of the j
laboring classes.
"I have stood ever as I stand now, bat
tlinc against usurpation or the natural :
rights oi the masses and insisting that
there shall be equal opportunities to ail,
special privileges to none," said Judee i
Maguire, and the audience applauded.
The speaker denied that the Demo- j
cratic party had endeavored to mate a i
class issue in this campaign, and said that
if anybody had thrown down the gauntlet j
of class issues it had been the Republicans, i
In this regard Judge Maguire read from |
the Chicago Auditorium speech, wherein i
the Democratic procession in Chicago was j
likened urto Coxey's army after it had !
reached Washington.
A quotation from Thomas Jefferson to j
the effect that a poor man, though ,
clothed in rags, if honest, is the equal of
the proudest aristocrat in the land, though
wrapped in the rich robes of regal gran
deur, called forth applanse.
Judge Maguire said that while he pro
posed to speak mainiy of the silver issue,
yet there were other subjects to whicu he
felt it a duty to call the attention of his ;
hearers. Tne most important that came j
tv his mind was the planK in the Demo- |
cratic platform which protests against
government by injunction. He said that j
this was a new invention to break clown i
the rights of the people. He described I
how injunctions were issued out of the
. United States courts and said that a man
srrested under such a proceeding, if he
should demand a trial by jury, would be j
told that no jury trial woul<: be alioweu i
for violating Judge-made law, and there- j
fore the Jadge would arbitrarily proceed !
to act as Judge and executioner" carrying j
out his own edicts without regard to the
rights of the people.
At this point an amusing episode inter
rupted the regular course of the meetine
by some one in the rear of the hall shout
ing out;
â¢Give us something about Grover Cleve
land."
ft IndÃe M .quire paused in his speech for
space of half a breath and then re
plied:
"Mr. Cleveland is not a factor in this
campaign. [Laughter.] I gave my opin- !
ion of Mr. Cleveland aud his policy when |
as a member of the committee on plat- !
form I voted against indorstngthat policy. |
[Applause] But, as I before remarked,
Mr Cleveland cuts no figure in this fight, I
and 1 have no farther words of censure for
him at this time." [Applause.]
R< ferring to the big railroad strike of
1894, in which Eugene V. Debs figured so
prominently, Judge Macuire read from
;he Federal Reporter to illustrate what he
characterized as usurpation on the part of
United States Judge Jenfcins when he
issued an injunction forbidding railroad |
employes from quitting the employ of the \
receiver appointed by the court, whether I
with or without notice. The speaker ap
pealed to all workingmen to arise and
condemn that kind of Judge-made law.
He said that Justice Harland of the i
United States Supreme Court, in a dissent- !
mc opinion, had denounced Judge. Jen
kins' action more severely than the
Chicago convention had done.
Touching the claim that bankers are the
only men who understand the money
question, Judge MaEUire said: "The ttue
Junction ot money is that it shall be used j
as a medium of exchange. That is the
way money is used by the people, and the
people are competent to judge for them
selves what kinds of money shall be used
for their purposes; Now bankers do not
use money as a medium of exchange.
Bankers have four use? for money, namely,
for hoarding, for speculation, to deposit
for obtaining credit or for lending. Then
w!m> shall deride what kinds of money
shiil be provided lor the uses of the peo
pli' I say that the people themselves
sbÂ».i decide."
Jud^e Maguire dwelt with considerable
warmth on the mooted question as to
whether any employers hack shown a dis
position to coerce their employes for the
purpose of helping to elect the Republi
can nominee for the Presidency. He said
that no matter whether such reports were
tru# or not, voters have tbe power in their
own hands, because the secret ballot gives
every man a chance to cast his vote accord
ing to his own convictions.
"The demonetization of silver was an
invasion of tbe people's rights," said Judge
Masnire. "If the Congress of the United
States had passed a law decreeing that the
people should no longer use woolen cloth
ing it would not have been any more an
invasion of the people's rights. But just
suppose for a moment that the cotton
standard had been thus established, and
we were now engaged in a campaign of
agitation with the avowed determination
of securing a reiurn to the double stand
ard of wool and cotton, you would see
cotton-bu^s rising up all over the country
and denouncing the acts of those wno be
lieve in wool as anarchists who are assail
ing the vested rights of capital."
Judge Maguire gave it as his opinion
that the political revolution of 1892, which
carried Grover Cleveland into the White
House and pave the Democrats a majority
In Congress was caused by the bard times
and labor troubles that brought discon
tent among the people.
There was considerable merriment
among Judee Mat.uire's hearers when he
said t::at with all due regard to tbe offi
cial head of the Nation, he bad never
brought himsdf to think or say that a
Democratic President was elected in 1892.
He said that in the issuance of bonds as
has been done recently, the President of
the United Slates is exercising thp power
of taxing the people, a power which when
exercised by a Kin>; of England caused a
revolution in that country 200 years ago.
He predicted a peaceful revolution by
means cf tbe ballot in this country so
soon as the people of the United States
understand the subject the same as he
does.
In dealing with the so-called 53-cent
dollar that is talked of Judge Maguire
said:
"Believers in the 53-cent dollar say
that the remonetization of silver will
help the silver - mine owners. How
can" that be? Their silver is worth
53 cents now, an.i if the proposed re
monetization is not to raise that value bow
are they to be benefited? There must be
a mistake somewhere in this statement of
the proposition. If the value of their
silver will be doubled there will be no 53
--cont dollar, and if there is to be a 53-cent
I dollar then the silver-mine owners have
nothing to gain."
Judge Maguire combatted the theory
that the silver standard was the cause of
industrial depression in Mexico and
China. "Labor depends on intelligence,
organization and political power for its
protection," said the speaker, and the ap
plause was cordial. He compared the
statement that the silver standard was the
cause of bard times in any country to
the theory of one of his friends that pug
hats and suspenders are the moving influ
ences that control civilization.
In conclusion Judge Maguire related
some rosy reports of Democratic acces
sions throughout the State, of California,
with a few straws from New York, Mich
igon, Massachusetts, Kentucky and Texas.
The meeting adjourned with three
cheers for Bryan, Maguire and free silver.

opened the programme with one of their
specialties and were recalled several
times. Miss H. I. Roney gave a vocal
folo. Sne was followed by Miss Ida
Wyatt, who performed a novelty in a rope
dance. A pleasing vocal solo was ren
dered by Mrs. Kenny and she gave way to
Miss Madeline Oastiimn In a fancy dance.
Mis 3M. Georgiani officiated at the piano.
Life in the booths was spirited in the ex
treme, and the auctioneers did so well that
several suggested that they would make a
success in real life in this calling. There
was no end of fnn in the '49 camp, where
make-heiieve cowboys, miners, Spanish
beauties and gamblers held sway, with all
the mimic surrounding of the days of old.
No mining camp was ever complete witn
out its burro or donkey, and this camp is
no exception. When the camp opened it
required the united strength 01 four large
men to carry the gray long-eared specimen
ot stubbornness up the stairs. Henry
Lang, George Knox, J. Chnstensen and T.
P. Urowley performed the feat, and ihey
still bear the marks of the brute's four
feet. The little beast will be carried down
stairs at 11:30 o'clock to-night, and the
crowd will wait to see the tun.
The police captain competition for the
gold watch which will be awarded to the
most popular captain of police is still as
spirited as ever. Captain Dunlevy last
evening was in the lead with about 3800
votes, but Captain Spillane was only 600
behind, with Captain VVittman in on a
close third. Over 20,000 votes have been
sold and just before the contest closes at
10:45 o'nlock to-night these votes will
come in by the thousands. No one knows
how the contest will go.
The letter carriers' contest for a gold
watch is no less interesting, tor over 6000
votes have been sold. The votes last night
stood as follows:
L. Nunan 389, A. Roed 331, C. Gillier
123, J. O'Connor 124, P. Whelan 105, C.
Wisewell 106, T. J. Mahoney 100, W. W.
O'Neill 102, F. Tyorl 115. The contest will
close to-ni,'ht at 10 o'clock sharp.
The festival will close this evening after
a most successful run since September 24.
It was planned by Father Crowley as a
means of raising money for the Youths'
Directory. It is expected the armory hall
will be crowded to the doors, but nobody
minds a jam in a worthy cause. A special
orchestra, under tbe leadership of T. P.
Crowley, will render operatic and popular
selections.
BARNES AT BERKELEY.
A Stlrrlnz Speech to a Large
Audience.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 13.â The largest
and most enthusiastic Republican rally of
the campaign in Berkeley was held to
night in Shattuck Hall. General W. H.
L. Barnes addressed an audience of 800
people, who were loud and frequent in
their applause whenever vital issues
of the campaign were touched upon. In
a few remarks Chairman Metcalf pre
sented General Barnes to the audience,
who gave a stirring address of an hour's
duration.
The speaker then entered into a statisti
cal review of the silver question beginning
with the act of 1873. and tracing its his
tory until to-day. Reference was made to
the deoline in value of the silver dollar
which took place under the Bland, Allison
and the Sherman acts, and General
Barnes told of a certain San Francisco
bank which had refused to take any more
silver except on special d posit, because
it had in its vault half a barrel of silver
dollars which were bought from tt:e Gov
ernment four years ago, and which have
be n lying there ever since because they
could not be disposed of.
"Bryan was nominated by a speech,"
continued General Barnes, "and not be
cause he was the man of the masses. He
went to the convention as a proxy, as a
reporter, as an onlooker, and he was named
for the Presidency of the United States
before he went away. This man Bryan,
who travels from one side of the country
to the other brpedinÃ hatred between man
and man, friend and friend, should re
ceive no more recognition from us than a
horse hitcned to a cart."

FATHER YORKE'S DENIAL.
He Doe* >ot Want Kector Remr'i
Position.
Rev. P. C. Yorke emphatically denies
that he has been directly or indirectly
suggested as tne successor ot Bishop
Keane, rector of the Catholic university
of Washington, lately deposed by the
Pope.
Key. Father Yorke says he is not a can
didate for the nosition for the reason that
none but Bishops are eligible for such a
situation. His denial is emphatic, and he
adds that the ambition for such a place by
any person other than a Bishop would be
ridiculous.

TWO TICKETS REJECTED,
Registrar Hinton Is Busy Weed
ing Out Political Para
sites.
Madison Babcock Will Run Inde
pendently for Superintendent of
Public Instruction.
Registrar Hinton was deluged yesterday
with petitions, protests and withdrawals
from ambitious politicians who want or
do not want places on the official ballot.
The most voluminous communication
received was from Madison .Babcock, the
present Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion, who desires to run as an independ
ent candidate. His petition for a place
on the official ballot was accompanied by
18,000 signatures, and the announcement
was made that be bad 8000 more in re
serve to be presented to-day.
D. J. Toony, in & letter to the Regis
trar, said that he ; understood his name
was in the petition of the Taxpayers'
Water party as a candidate . for Police
Judge. He asked that he be taken off the
list at once. As the ticket of the party
mentioned has been rejected as a whole
by the Registrar, Mr. Toohy is in no dan
ger of defeat.
William Tomsky presented his petition,
accompanied by a sufficient number of
names, to be allowed a place on the offi
cial Dal lot as an independent candidate for
Justice of the Peace.
Over 3000 names accompanied the peti
tion of the United Labor party that came
in yesterday afternoon, and the following
were named as an auditing committee:
Thomas B. ; Roche, Jeremiah Murphy,
John W. Emmerton, J. Smiley and Wil
liam Homer.
P. A. Dolan tiled the petition of an al
leged party called the , Free Silver i and
Protection party, but as . such names as
Billy de Pomp and Pat Crowley, King of
all the RusMas, were signed, Registrar
Hinton rejected the ticket. , . ..,
t The Registrar ; also rejected the certifi
cate of nomination for member of Assem
bly in the Thirty-ninth District offered
for filing by P. M. Tuiey, because it was
not : signed by electors â of the district to
the number of 3 per cent of the total vote
polled there at the iast election.
; The following election officers were ap
pointed by the Election Commissioners

AMADOR QUEEN
MAY BE SOLD
A Rich London Syndicate
Holds an Option on
the Mine.
Has Spent Ten Thousand Dol
lars in Exploring the
Property.
IXPENSIVE SHAFT NECESSARY
The S=m Syndicate Recently Par
chased Big Properties Near
Salt Lake.
A deal is on for the purchase by a big
London syndicate of the Amador Queen
mine of Amador County. For nearly three
months now the United States Exploration
Company, composed of some of the largest
capitalists of London, presided over Dy a
director of the Bank of England, nas had
an option on the property at a purchase
price, it ia said, of $150,000.
During this time the company has spent
$10,000 in exploring and developing about
the mine, with a view to learning its pros
pects. The agent, having completed an
inspection, will, it is understood, submit
a favorable report to headquarters at Lon
don, witn the information that about $100,
--000 will be required to sink a shaft to the
depth of 1000 ieet, at which level the best
paying ore may be obtained. At present
the greatest depth reached ia between 300
and 400 feet.
C. V. Parsons, a prominent attorney of
Denver, Colo., who is out here in the in
terests of the London syndicate, was seen
yesterday at the Palace Hotel, and, while
he confirmed the information, added that
the transfer is not, of course, definitely as
sured. He has visited the new Salt Lake
property, the Butte mines, and has only
just returned from Amador Connty.
His tour was simply for the purpose ol
seeing how things were progressing.
He expresses surprise at the lack of in
terest taken in the mother lode by San
Francisco capitalists, and declares that if
Denver had any such prospects almost at
her very doors tbe country would be
pierced with hundreds of 1000-foot shafts.
The core of the mother lode, he asserts, is
down from 1000 to 1400 feet, and most of
the mines have only been scratched near
the surface.

PERFECT PHYSICAL
MANHOOD!
How Lost jMjJow-BepM!
What is there in all nature that calls
for greater admiration than a perfect
specimen of physical manhood? ; He com-
mands the admiration of all kinds and
classes regardless of sex. Why is this the-
case? â It is undoubtedly due to â  the fact
, that there is a comparative scarcity of
physically perfect men. All -men, are. as
a rule born equal in the matter of physical
health and strength, yet how unequal in
these attributes is the standing of mdny
compared with their fellow-men* before
their life's race is a quarter or a third run.
The cause is a common one â unfortunately
too common. : The , affliction ' responsible
for the shattered and broken-down con-
dition both physically and mentally of so
many men, both young and middle-aged,
is Nervous Debility. It is either the result
of youthful indiscretions or of living at
the pace that kills. , Excessive indul-
gences, mental worry ' and anxiety, all
producing a constant strain and drain on
the nervous system, soon undermine the
strongest constitution. The result is
manifest in the many physical and men-
tal wrecks met with every day "in â¢ life.
Where health and strength, both mental
and physical, should exist if the body had
been well cared for there is seen instead a
man afflicted with that most horrible of all
diseases, Nervous Debility, with its train
of attending evils. It is manifested in the
following symptoms: Weakness of body
and mind, brain dullness, dizziness, loss
of memory, a wandering - mind,' lack of
energy and confidence, pains in . the head
and back, dimness of vision, . discontent,
despondency, an aversion â to society,
dread of impending danger,' etc. If you
are suffering - from Nervous Debility, if
your manly powers are waning or failing
y ,11 CAN BE RESTORED TO
t PHYSICAL AND MENTAL
HEALTH ;
By consulting that eminent specialist,
DOCTOR SWEANY. He is a physician
of rare attainments, and skill. Years, of
study and scientific research have given
to - him a - knowledge of ; the - science of
medicine such as but few physicians in the
country possess, v Besides being possessed
of this knowledge he is endowed to a high
degree I with | another i indispensable ' attri-
bute of all great physicians, and that is a
thorough feeling of sympathy with each
and : every â¢ patient. No better recom-
mendation of his standing and skill as a
physician and- specialist could be - de-
manded than the fact that HE HAS FOR
TEN YEARS PAST BEEN ENGAGED
IN THE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFES-
SION 5 IN THIS CITY.' During >, this
period he has met with unequaled success
âa success that is attained only by a few.
He stands to-day in the front rank of ; the
foremost medical men of the country, and
throughout the laud thousands whom he
has cured give eloquent unsolicited testi-
mony concerning the doctor's marvelous
skill in conquering disease. There is jno
one lemfdy, no "cure all," used for every
case, for iit is 1 utter â  nonsense : to i assume
that one certain kind of medicine will
answer in every case. Each patient's case
is carefully diagnosed \, and * the particular
kind of treatment ana , medicine required
to CURE is given. -/> > I , â¢

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Wherever work and wages is an issue
the tariff is an issue.
It is not too late yet to join a Republi
can club. There will be lota of fun before
the finish.
â¢
Cleveland is writing his final message
to Congress, and oh! what a contrast it
will be to the tinal message of Harrison.
Tbe usual Democratic campaign canard
may be expecied at any time now, and it
is likely to be a whopper when it comes.
Bryan is dwindling so rapidly that by
tbe time the election is over lie will not
have to crawl into a hole to be lost to
sight.
The choice before workingmen in this
campaign is the simple one of good money
and good wages or poor money and no
wages.
The fli?nt of the Bryanites to the woods
shouting "coercion" is but another illus
tration that the wicked flee when no man
pursueth. -_
The result of the Democratic experi
ment with free wool is a good enough
warning against any Democratic experi
ment with free silver.
No Popocrat procession is up to date
without a number of masked men in line
leading a great coercion guyascutas to
Irighten the American workingman.
There is still one ttiing lacking in the
campaign. The Palmer and Backner
managers hare not yet issued their esti
mate of the vote that is to elect their men.
Ihe absence of Senators Jones and
Stewart from the free-silver stump i 3 dis
appointing many people who would iiJce
to hear why they voted for "the crime
of "73."
Sending Aitgeld to New York to reply
to Bourke Cockran and Carl Schurz is a
poor way of making a campaign, but it
has the excuse of being the best tbe
Popocrats can do.
Bryan was expected to reply to Arch
bishop Ireland's letter in his Minneapolis
speech, but as be did not make the at
tempt it seems the boy orator has some
discretion after all.
The accession of Bayard to the ranks of
the supporters of Palmer and Buckner is
subject to t!>e double drawback that bis
voice has no influence and he is too far
away from home to vote.
Democrats may declare the masked men
in their processions are afraid of coercion,
but tbe chances are they are fellows who
are ashamed of themselves or afraid to
show their faces to tbe police.
The success of Cator in capturing the
Democratic legislative ticket while Buck
ley captured the Populist municipal
ticket may have been a mere coincidence,
and then again it may have been a trade.
In declaring that he does not know
what the Populists mean Bourke Cockran
shows himself in the same situation as tbe
rest of us, but all the same it is a safe
guess that they mean trouble , to the
country.
Bryan's attempts to arouse class
hatreds amonsj the people have jnatly ex
cited indignation in tbe East, and as a
result the candidate is rapidly becoming
more objectionable than the platform he
stands on.
According to the best estimates Mc-
Kinley is certain of election, being
assured of 270 votes in tbe electoral col
lege, while his popular majority will be
in all probability the largest ever given to
a Presidential candidate.
Under the load of Cator the Populists
have swallowed the Democratic legislative
ticket, and under the lead of Buckley the
Democrats have swallowed the Populist
local ticket. When this rival swallowing
is at an end which party will find itself
on the inside of the other?
"If Healdsburg," says the Enterprise of
that city, '"could secure a beet-sugar fac
tory it would bring a deal of sweetness to
this section"; and yet the Enterprise
places the names of Bryan and Bewail at
tbe head of its columns when it knows
there isn't a sugar factory in the whole
Democratic programme.
A high tariff hurts no American in
dustry, while a low tariff may work abso
lute ruin. This has been verified by the
experience of the last three years. It is
evident, therefore, that the proper policy
ior the Government to pursue is to restore
tariff duties that will protect the indus
tries of the country before we go forward
to any new issues whatever.
CONTRASTED CANDIDATES
No student of the course of events in
this campaign can fail to notice tbat from
the day of bis nomination McKinley has
steadily grown in the estimation of the
public, while Mr. Bryan has fallen below
the level even of what reputation he en
joyed when tbe nomination was given to
him. Day by day, daring all these weeks,
Major McKinley has spoken from the
porch of his cottage-home in Canton words
that have carried courage and hope and
confidence to the people; while from every
stump to which his wandering footsteps
have carried him Bryan has talked of
nothing but the strife of classes and sec
tional animosities, Mid, so far from inspir
ing those who heard him with confidence,
has filled the minds of the more reflecting
of his audience with anxiety as to the out
come of our present problems.
Major McKinley, an far from endeavor
ing to excite passion or prejudice in this
campaign, has spoken those "large, divine
and comfortable words" wbich lift men's
minds above even such prejudices or ani
mosities as formerly disturbed them. His
addresses to Confederate veterans have
won the warm approval of the veterans of
the Grand Army, and have manifested
how completely the Nation nas forgotten
or forgiven the mistakes of the terrible
years of the Civil War. His addresses to
workingmen and to capitalists have shown
how clearly he perceives the common in
terests which bind them, and have re
vealed the extent of a patriotism wise
enougb to plan for tbe best interests of
Noith and South, of rich and poor. To
him the people are one unit, ns this fed
eration of States is one Nation. He
knows no difference*; he stands steadfast
as the champion of all.
Mr. Bryan, on the other hand, while he
has not been so silly as to adopt the advice
of Tillman and Watson and make a sec
tional campaign, has, from the very be
ginning of his speeches, appealed to every
prejudice which might be supposed to
exist in tbe minds of tbe poor against the
rich, or of workingmen against their em
ployers. He has not been above using the
lowest arts of tne demagogue. He has
hardly been above the falsehoods of reck
less agitators. If he has not said he has
at least insinuated that the campaign of
his opponents is beinz made by bribery,
intimidation and coercion, and he has
given the more reckless among the people
reason to believe tbat if elected to the
Presidency he would endeavor to subvert
the interests of capita', in order to satisfy
the envy of those less prosperous in life.
He secured his nomination by a speech of
some brilliancy, but since that day in all
his speeches he has not uttered one sen
tence that will live in literature, nor a
sentiment to which the better instincts of
the American people respond. Thus he
has steadily gone downward in public re
pute, and when he ia defeated on election
day tbere will hardly be a patriot even in
his own party who will regret his discom
fiture.
Our people have iten the folly of the
course pursued in previous â <-ari and
havtÂ« fuliy determined to correct it. We
have not only halted in our inarch in the
â wrong direction, bnt we have wheeled
about and shall certainly march back
and rebuild the fences we have torn
down and reopen the doors we have un
wisely closed. Idleness as a National
policy han been tested to everybody's
satisfaction, and nobody any longer be
lieves in it.â Hon. F. S. Black of >ew
York.
A DUTY OF CITIZENSHIP.
The weoks whicti elapse between this and
election day will p'ss rapidly. Whatever
campaign work any citizen can hop? to do
should begin at once. It is hardly neces
sary to say that every man who nas any
repute or influence among his acquaint
ances can do something to determine the
votes of those who still remain ionfn?ei
by the issnes of the contest and unde
cided how to act. That influence, there
fore, should be exerted rightly and ex
erted at once.
There can be no question of the great
ness of the issues before us. The tariff
affects every industry, the financial ques
tion touches not only all industries but
all trades, all savings and all obligations,
while the Bryanite attack on the Supreme
Court involves the maintenance of law
itself and threatens to weaken every safe
guard of property and of individual and
National welfare. It is difficult for the
average man to comprehend how momen
tous these issues are. Many of those who
were deceived by free trade are liable to be
deceived about free silver. Every citizen,
therefore, who understands the danger
ahead should be diligent in warning the
people against it.
It is a matter for congratulation that
almost every man of eminence in the
country has been outspoken in denuncia
tion of Bryanism. Party rivalry ha 9 been
thrown aside by our abler statesmen and
great newspapers and to-day patriotic
Democrats are" hardly lens earnest than
patriotic Republicans in their efforts to
counteract the pernicious influences of
Bryan, Altgeld and Tillman. Thanks to
these efforts tbere is little or no chance of
success for what has been so justly called
"the party of revolution." Even that
-mail chance, however, should be de
stroyed before election day. This can be
done if every good citizen will take the
trouble to exert his influence for the party
of law, industry and prosperity. Let all
good citizens declare themselves with
vigor and emphasis and the doubters will
soon cease to be doubtful. A resolute con
viction clearly expressed goes far to form
public opinion and that much at least the
country has a right to expect from every
citizen who has tbe intelligence to form
an opinion and the courage to avow it.
Start tbe factories and put American
machinery in operation, and tbere frill
not be an idle man Iv the country who
it willing and able to work; there will
not be an American home where hun
ger and want will not disappear at
onee â and there will not be a farmer
â¢who -will not be cheered and benefited
by his Improved home market* and by
the better and steadier prices for his
products.â Wllliira MeKinley.
A BUGABOO CAMPAIGN.
A dispatch from St. Louis under date
October 11 announced that a large mer
chant in that city, an ardent supporter of
the gold standard, bad, on the day before,
discharged a number of men from hid em
ployment because he found that they
were supporters of Mr. Bryan. We do not
know whether this story is true or false.
It comes to us in the general news of the
day and may ba considered as fairly ac
curate. The incident is of little import
ance, but it has led a reader of The Call
to ask us in apparent sincerity whether it
does not justify the charge of the Popocrat
orators ana organs that intimidation and
coercion is being used to compel wage
earners to vote for McKinley or to forfeit
their positions.
The answer to the question is plain. If
this story from St. Louis is true it is only
another proof that there are fools in the
world, and even in our own intelligent,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1896.
enlightened and liberal America. What
some particular individual may dodoes
not affect the general mass of the people.
The cry of coercion and intimidation is es
sentially a bugaboo. It is the introduc
tion into American politics of the Chinese
dragon which is supposed to scare and
frighten everybody on the street, but
which is known and well understood by
every intelligent man to be nothing more
than a sham, a shell, a hollow mockery.
The whole cry of coercion is so silly that
it would have occasioned no comment if
it had not been to a large extent led by no
less a person than William Jennings
Bryan, the Popocratic candidate ior Presi
dent. The American workingraan is not
a fool and he is not a coward. He cannot
be intimidated, even if the employers of
labor were silly enough in mind and false
enough to American principles to attempt
it. Throughout all America, except a few
Southern States, tbe balloi is fair and
free. There could be no intimidation
under the secret ballot system even if it
were attempted, and certainly it will not
be attemDted by any man who has sense
enough to vote the Republican ticket and
to understand Republican principles.
It is evident the Bryanite orators and
organs, despairing of success by fair argu
ment, have determined to make m the
closing weeks of the campaign an attempt
to frignten the foolish by this story of
coercion and intimidation, and to win the
support of the brave by leading them to
believe they will be standing up for
American independence if they work and
vote against the Republican party.
Against such low tactics as these nonest
and intelligent men must be on their
guard. We had an experience in Cali
fornia during tbe Garfield campaign with
tte forged Morey letter which has taught
people to beware of stories issued from
the Democratic headquarters during the
closing days of the campaign. That
trick cannot be successfully repeated.
We were fooled once by the fraud
of our adversaries, and if we are deceived
a second time it will be our own fault.
The purpose of free coinage is not only
dishonest, but impossible. Tou cannot
create a value by statute nor compel the
other nations of the world to abide by
what yon declare to be wise. Integrity
is beyond the control of legislation, and
you can no more force the people of
other countries to accept 53 cents for a
dollar that yon owe them than you can
force them to pay 147 cents for a dollar
that they owe youâ Hon. F. S. Black of
New York,
THE TARIFF ISSUE.
Although Democratic orators and organs
endeavor by every means in their power
to divert the attention of the American
people from the tariff issue, the condition
of American industry, and, indeed, of
every American home, is such that the
issue cannot be overlooked by the peeplÂ«
when they go to the polis on election day.
A high tariff means prosperity; a low
tariff means enforced economy in every
hon:e and destitution in Domes of thou
sands. Under such conditions tbe people
would be foolish indeed if tdey did not
regard the restoration of a protective tariff
as one of the first remedies to be applied
for the evils of the time.
During tbe three years prior to Mr.
Cleveland's inauguration the net.increase
in savings banks deposits was $99,000,000,
$89,000,000 and $73,000,000, respectively.
The year succeeding his inauguration
was one of wreck, ruin and disaster. The
people earned no wages and were com
pelled to live on their savings, the conse
quence being that the net decrease In sav
ings Dank deposits for 1894 was $38,000,000,
whicn, as compared with the increase of
the previous year, showed a loss of about
$111,000,000.
According to the reports of the Secretary
of Agriculture, tbe farm crops of the
country, which in 1892 were valued at over
$2,000,000,000, had decreased in 1895 to
only a little over $1,786;000,000. Accord
ing to Curtis' "Protection ana Prosper
ity," a work which contains a careful com
pilation of statistics, obtained from re
liable sources, the value of our manufac
turing products, which, by the census of
1890, amounted to $9,370,000,000, had de
creased in 1895 to about $5,000,000,000.
The American Protective Tariff League,
from a careful census of the industries of
the country, estimates an annual loss of
$350,000,000 in wages in the manufacturing
interests between 1892 and 1896.
Bradstreet's returns of bank clearings
show that in ten mouths of 1892, as com
pared with ten months of 1895, wbich was
the roost prosperous year of Mr. Cleve
land's administration, the business of the
country lost $7 000.000,000. To this is to be
added the fact that Mr. Cleveland's bond
sales have increased the National debt by
$262,500,00u.
These statistics carry their moral with
them. Surely it needs no argument to
convince reflecting men that a tariff sys
tem under which such grave disasters
have fallen upon the people is totally false
to American interests. It benefits none;
it injures all. To overthrow it is a neces
sity of the time, and the only way to over
throw it is to vote for McKinley, the cham
pion of protection and the advance agent
of prosperity.

Letters From the People*
TAXATION OF MORTGAGES
View of a vitlzm Who Tavora the Pro
posed Constitutional Amendment
Exempting Them.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
In view of the fact that several articles have
appeared In the columns of your paper and
other San Francisco dailies opposed to the
adoption of the proposed amendment to the
constitution exempting mortgages and trust
deeds from taxation, I beg leave to submit the
following considerations in its favor.
Before the adoption of the present constitu
tion it was found that the lender or mortgagee,
to escape the payment of the mortgaze tax, in
serted a provision in the mortgage that the
borrower or mortgagor should pay the tax on
the mortgage as well a 9 on the property mort
gaged. To prevent this the new constitution
provided by section 3, article XIII (which Is
proposed to be repealed by this amendment),
that "every contract hereai*.er made, by which
a debtor is obligated to pay any tax or assess
ment on money loaned, or on any mortgage,
deed of trust, or other lien, shall, as to any in
terest specified therein, and as to such tax or
assessment, be null and void." This provision
was not so successful as was anticipated, for,
although just and proper on its face, it
amounted to little more than a usury law
without the binding force of such an act. For,
although it prevented an express provision re
quiring the mortgagor to pay the tax, it did
not prevent the mortgagee charging an ex
orbitant rate of interest to cover all possible
expenditures for taxes on his part. Thus the
mortgagor in fact bore the burden as before-
That this was the necessary result of the pro
vision is very forcibly shown by Mr. Justice
Harrison in Hewitt vs. Dean, 91 Cal. 5, 12:
"It is well known thai prior to the adorn on of
the present constitution it was the universal
custom for the mortgagee to incorporate into
the mortgage a stipulation binding the mort
gagor to pay all taxes thatmiaht be levied
upon the mortgage or the debt secured
thereby. This provision engendered a vast
amount of litigation, and the collection of this
tax was stoutly resisted at all points, chiefly
upon the ground that a tax imposed upon tne
land, ana aiso upon a mortgage thereon, was
double taxation and unconstitutional. As a
consequence of various decisions of the Su
preme Court in this litieation all money
loaned upon mortgage security escaped taxa
tion, and the owner ot the laud mortgaged was
compelled to pay more than his share of the
expense of government. It was for the pur
pose of obviating this consequence that the
constitutional convention xdopted the fore
going provision cf section 5, article XIII, in
order tnat a portion of the taxes might be col
lected lrom the mortgagee anil that the burden
upon the mortgagor might not at the
same time be increased. The provision thus
incorporated into the constitution was in
tended for the benefit of the borrower, but it
is unnecessary to say that the results expected
therefrom have not been realized.
"All experience has shown that the rate of
interest is governed by the inflexible laws of
trade, and is regulated by the same law of sup
ply and demand as that which governs all
other articles of commerce, and that legisla
tures and constitutional conventions are now
eriess in their attempts to change tnis law;
that whenever the State imposes a tax upon a
commodity the burden of that lax is borne by
him whose necessities require him to pur
chase, and not by nun who holds it for sale.
â¢ * â¢ * It is unnecessary to do more than
to state the proposition tnat whatever bur
dens in the form of taxation the State imposes
upon money which is loaned are in reaiity
borne by the borrower, and not by the lender;
that the lender, in fixing the rate of interest
for the loan, will invariably add the amount
of this tax to the market value of the money,
and, under the guise of interest, collect from
the borrower a sufficient amount to reimbuise
himself for the amount of the tax."
Justice Croi-keit, in the case of Savings and
Loan Society vs. Austin, 40 Cal. 415. uses the
following language: "Imerest on money
loaned is paid as a compensation
for the use of the money, and tne rate of
Interest, as agreed upon, is the amount which
tiie parties stimulate will be a just equivalent to
the lender. If, however, by the imposition of
a tax on the debt the Government diminishes
the profit which the lender would otherwise
receive, the rate of interest will be increased
sufficiently to cover the tax, which, iv this
way, will be ultimately paid by the borrower.
The triir:sac;ion would be governed by the
same immutable, inflexible law of trade by
n-aÂ»on oi which import duties on articles of
consumption are Ultimate y paid by the con
sumer, and not by the importer.
â¢'J he rate of interest on money loaned is reg
ulated by tlie law of supp.y and demand,
wnieh governs all articles of commerce, and
burdens imposed by law, in the form of a tax
on thÂ« transaction, which would thereby
diminish the profit of the lender, is paid by
him, will prompt him to compensate the loss
by increasing to that extent the rate of interest
demanded. If his money would command a
given rate of interest without the burden he
will be vigilant to see that the borrower as
sumes the burden, either by express stipula
tion or in the form of increased interest. r lhis
is tho law of human nature, which statute
Jaws are powerless to suppress and which per
vades the whole renlm of trade governed by
the luw of supply and demand. Nor would
the enactment of the most stringent usury
laws produce a different practical result. Hu
man ingenuity has hitherto proved inadequate
to the task of devising usury laws which were
incapable of evasion and wherever they exist
they are and will continue to be subordinate
to that higher law ot trade which ordains that
money, like other articles of commercia. value,
will command just what it is Â«orthinthe
marketâ no more and no less. Assuming these
. premises to be correct, and I am convinced
that they are, it results that it is the borrower
and not the lender who iv fact pays the lax on
borrowed money, whethersecured by mortgage
or not."
The tru h of these observations has at last
been seen by the Legislature, and what is he
remedy proposed ? That the borrower shall
ptiy the taxes on the mortgage an well as on
the land mortgaged ? No. But the only possi
ble lemedy, viz. : that ihe mortgage be ex nipt
fn.m taxation. The discussion may be summed
up as follows: If the mortgage is to be taxed
at nil the mortgagor must ultimately bear the
burden, and therefore the only way to avoid
this is to exempt it from taxation entirely. It
is objected tnat this will benefit the lender.
Even granting that it will, will it not also
benefit the borrower ? In other words, is it
not advantageous to the borrower to obtain
money at the lowest possible rate oi interest ?
It certainly is. Now, can he do so when the
rate is fixed so as to cover all possible taxes 7
HÂ« certainly cannot. In my opinion, there
lore, this amendment will be oi great benefit
to the borrower; of far more benefit than it
will be to the lender.
Since this conclusion was reached James D.
Phelau has written an open letter pointing
out the fact that under the present constitu
tion "credits" are taxable and maintains hat
an exemption of "mortgages" merely, as is
provided by this amendment, will not exempt
the mortgage debt or the note which the
mortgage secures. If this conclusion be
correct, the purpose of the amendment would
be defeated. I do not think, however, that
a sound construction ot the section as
amended warrants any such interpretation.
The section in effect provides that "all" prop
erty shal. be taxed; that "property" includ s
"credits," provided that mortgages shall i ot
bÂ» taxed. It will be seen at a glance .that the
word "mortgage" is intended to limit the
word "property" and may limit the word
"credits," since they are declared to be prop
erty. That is, the amendment "may" exempt
certain '"credits" irom taxation. If this be
true, it is incorrect to say that all credi.s are
taxable under the present constitution. That
this is the effect of the amendment can, I
believe, be easily shown. Tne word "mort
gage" does not reier to the instrument of that
name, but to the "debt" secured by the mort
gage. It is not the mortgageâ the deedâ that
Is taxed at the present time, but the debt that
is secured by the mortgage. If I am right in
this contention, it results that all credits are
taxable, except credits or debts secured by
mortgage or trust deed. This being go, Mr.
Phelan's objection is entirely obviated. The
only thine necessary to make this true is proof
that the word "mortgage" means or includes
debts or credits secured Dy mortgage.
This proof is not far to seek. In Falkner vs.
Hunt (16 Cal. lt>7) it was held that, under a
statute providing that all property was subject
to taxation, including "all the money at in
terest, secured by mortgage or otherwise," a
mortgage as such was not taxable, the Court
saying: "In a certain loose sense a mortgage
may be regarded as personal property, but evi
dently it is not so regarded in this act. â¢ â¢ â¢
Prima facie, a mortgage is no more taxable
than a deed or any other instrument of title
or mere security. The money which it secures
may be taxed In People vs. Park (23 Cal.
130), the Court said: " * * * it is the debt
and not the security which is properly taxa
ble." And in People vs. Eastman ('25 Cal.
001) the Court said: "The property to be as
sessed In such cases is the money at Interest or
debts. The money at interest, debt or obliga
tion, is the principal thing, and the mortgage
is only a securityâ a mere Incident to the debt
or obligation."
It follows from these decisions tnat a mort
gage as such is not taxable. Now, if a mort
gage Is not taxable, what is the necessity of
passing an amendment exempting it from
taxation ? This amendment must be given
some meaning, and that meaning must be that
mortgage debts shall be exempt and not
merely the mortgage, which was never tax
able. That this conclusion is correct a mo
ment's thought will demonstrate. If a mort
gage as such is taxable it must be taxed in
proportion to its value. Now what is its
value ? The amount of the debt, of course.
Therefore, it is the debt and not the mortgage
that is taxed at the present time, and there
lore an exemption of the mortgage is an ex
emption of the mortgage debt.

Doing in Aid of the Sixth Amendment. :
To the Editor of the San Francisco CallâSin: A

that time fifty more have enrolled themselves

have protested against having been omitted
from the first list. Here are the fi fty names to

Every newspaper in California has given
space to suffrage departments, published no
tices of meetings, etc., willingly and without
charge, but I have counted no paper as in
favor of suffrage unless this declaration haa
been explicitly made in the editorial columns.
If any mistakes of omission or commission
have been made I hope I may have an oppor
tunity to correct them.
It is hardly necessary to state tbat all of this
newspaper support has been a free-will offer
ing. It represents papers of every political or
ganization, of all creeds, of various nationali
ties, and illustrates, as nothing else could do,
the absolutely non-political, non-sectarian
character of the woman-suffrage movement.
Not, to the knowledge of our State Central
Committee, has one dollar been spent on the
newspapers during the present campaign, and
yet the help and encouragement they have
given toward the enfranchisement of women
never has teen equaled in this or any other
country. It does not seem possible ihat an
issue can fail which is thus championed. If
the men will stand by the women of Califor
nia as the press has done the sixth amend
ment will be carried by a large majority at the
November election. Ida A. Harper,

COLLIDED AND
NEARLY SUNK
The San Lorenzo Had to
Be Beached on Goat
Island.
She Was Run Into by tne
Steamer City of Stockton
While Decking.
SOW OVEE A PBOFfLLEB.
Lieutenant Butt of the Hartley Says
Uncle Sam Never Pays
Salvage.
The river steamers City of Stockton and
San Lorenzo were in collision. , In conse
quence, tbe latter boat is on the beach at
Goat Island and the City of Stockton has
a slightly damaged nose.
Tbe accident happened early yesteiday
morning. 'Ihe San Lorenzo was docked
at Washington-street wharf, having just
arrived from the ripper end of the bay
with a general cargo. The City of Stock
ton was getting in from Stockton with a
crowd of Valley- road excuaionists aboard.
"While attempting to make a landing the
tide rip caught her stern, swinging the
boat around and headed her directly for
the San Lorenzo. The engines were put
full spe^d astern, but, nevertheless, the
momentum was too great to be overcome.
The San Lorenzo received a hard, glancing
blow and some of the Stockton's bow was
carried away. In a few minutes the
Lorenzo began to leak and the tug Annie
was called upon to pump her out. The
leak gained, and, seeing that his vessel
was in danger of sinking in the slip, the
captain started for Goat Island, with the
tug alongside pumping out all the time.
The freight was moved forward in order
to get the stern out of water as much as
possible and tbus reduce the leal.. Finally
the vessel was beached on the island, and
after being made partially water-tight will
be brought over and put on the drydock
for repairs. No timbers were broken, but
the hull was badly strained.
The excursionists on the Stockton took
the matter very coolly and there was not
even a showing of excitement among the
lady passengers when the two boats came
together- 88Â£99
Lieutenant Butt of the revenue-cutter
Hartley and Captain Brown, superin
tendent of the State tugs and dredgers,
are having quite a lively time of it ail to
themselves. It is all over a bronze pro
oeller, and the question of State and Fed
eral rights is involved. Last July the
Hartley lost her propeller at or near sec
tion 2 of the seawalL xbe boat has been
a veritable white elephant on the hands
of the Government lor years and at first it
â  was decided to condemn her. Then the
Secretary of the Treasury thou ht better
of it and the boat was fitted up and again
put in commission. A few days ago
dredger No. 2 was at work at section 2 and
picked up the Hartley's lost propeller. As
soon as Lieutenant Butt heard of it he de
manded the properly. Captain Redmond
refused to give it up and referred the rev
enue officer to Superintendent Brown.
The latter also refused to give up the pro
peller unless the men on the dredger were
paid for their trouble. ! Then Lieutenant
Butt explained that Uncle Sam had a
right to take his property wherever he
found it, and Brown answered. "All right;
bring on your gunboat." The lieuten
ant retired "in an augry mood and laid the
matter before the United States District
Attorney. The chances are that in a lew
days an order of court will be issued com
manding Captain Redmond to deliver up
the article in dispute.
The sealing schooner Alton is making
an unusually long passage from the hunt
ing grounds. She was in company with
the Luisa D and Rattler in Oonamak Pass,
but although bo; schooners have been in
for nearly a fortnight there is no word of
the Alton. She was formerly a tug, but
the machinery wes taken out and she was
turned into a sailing vessel. While in
Alaskan waters Captain Wester had to
run her on the beach at Atu and place an
iron band around her stern in order to
keep the rudder from dropping out. In
consequence the Alton is not being
pushed and she may not get in for several
days.
Captain Fred Nelson of the sealing
schooner Rattler is about to make atrip
to his oid home in Denmark. He has
been in this country for years and now he
has resolved on a trip to his old stamping
ground. Captain Nelson is one of toe neat
liked men in the sealing fleet. He is be
loved by every hunter in the country and
Bailors run over each other in their efforts
to get aboard any vessel he goes in com
mand of. The day he leaves San Fran
cisco the men intend gathering at the fer
ries and giving him an ovation. .
The chances are .that the British ship
Bay of Bengal, which arrived nere in bal
last from Valparaiso, will go to Portland,
Or., to load wheat. Her captain yesterday
refused '. an offer â¢ of 35 shillings to load
flour, as he thought a rising market for
wheat would insure him a higher rate. . :
The British ship Largiemcre has had a
unique experience. She took ia ballast at
Rio de Janeiro and went , to Adelaide,
Australia. There was nothing doing
there, so she ' came on to San Francisco.
She still has the same ballast in her and
is still uncbartered.
The ship Two Brothers arrived yester
day from Pyramid Harbor, Alaska. , On
August 31 Robert White, one of the sail
ors, fell overboard ana was drowned. It
was blowing half a gale at the time.
The following particulars about Captain
W. O. Harden, whose death was reported
in yesterday's Call, will be read with in
terest by bis many friends :
Captain William O. . Hayden was born in
Maine m 1840, and served for nix years on the
Atlantic Coast before coming West. On his
arrival he was for a short time on the bark
Vernon, from Ban Francisco to Port Gamble,
but in ISO went back to Maine and built the
bark Rainier, fine was launched' in June,
1865, and Captain Hayden took her to New
lÂ«>rk. where she was loaded, and then sailed
lor Ban Francisco. After., making two trips
north with the bark he returned to New York
in 1567 to bring toe tug Sol Thomas around.
He then took the bark Bnena Vista to the
Sound, leaving her at Port Gamble to again
command the bark . Eainier, , wriere he re
mained a year or two. He left the Rainier to
take the historic steamer Goliah . from San
Francisco to the Sound and spent the next
year on her introducing her to the waters
which were to be her future home. . He then
rejoined the Rainier, making two trips to
S.uth America and one to San Francisco,
where he left her to take the ship Ark wrlght.
After two voyages with her In the British Co
lumbia coal trade, and one .from Nanaimo to
Acspulco in the same traffic, he left her at
Victoria, where be was ;- laid up fourteen
months with Mexican fever. After his recov- i
cry he went to San Francisco and took charge
of the ship Eldorado, running between Seattle
and that city for three years, she wax lost on
the third trip after he left her. His next ves
sel was tbe ship Two Brothers, on the same
route. It was. while on this vessel that he
made a fifteen months' trip around the world
spending nine years on ncr altogether. -
While j Hayden was ' captain ,of the Two
Brothers, her cabins were , robbed of all their
valuables, including his private papers. For
three years after leaving her he ran on the
ship Palestine between San Francisco and Ta
coma. subsequently leaving the ocean to run
on Sound steamers.* Since then he has com
manded the Ekagit Chief, Henry Bailey, State
of Washington; North Pacific arid Sehome. and
at various times has served as pilot in the city
of Seattle, in 1893 be chartered the steamer
Signal and operated her for a short time. Cap

years oh this coast, and during that period
was in the employ of two companies only.

LANIGAN SHOWS
HIS PARTISANSHIP
His Opponents Call It Offen
sive to Civil Service
Rules.
Three Supervisors He Wants, and
for Them He Desperately
Battles.
JOHN DAGGETT'S MEN AT WOEK
Mint Employes Given Permission to
Shout for Rainey's Nominees.
Fbelan Is Waning.
Strife is brewing in tne Democratic
ranks In San Francisco over the charter
question. Tbe anti-charter sentiment bas
developed unexpected vitality among the
Bnctleyites during tbe past two weeks. It
was generally understood tbat tbe Buck
ley wing of tbe Democratic party would
refuse to work for the charter, even from
tbe moment tbat tuat instrument was fin
ished by its framers, but it remained for
Joseph I. Dimona, Buckley nominee for
Mayor, to crystallize anl give voice to tbat
feeling. Since Mr. Dimond bas openly
announced tbat be is opposed to tbe char
ter there bas been a rallying of tbe forces
to support bim in tbat matter.
James D. Pbelan, tbe Junta nominee
for Mayor, will be tbe sufferer on account
of this not altogether unexpected issue in
tbe local campaign.
Careful students of the political situation
in San Francisco agree tbat the charter
discussion is bound to cat a big figure in j
the result of ttie election. No person of i
tagacity can possibly shut hit. eyes to this
fact. Since Mr. Phelan, in his own per
sonality, seeks to represent tbe spirit and
force of the proposed new charter, any op
position that materializes against tbe in
strument must necessarily and inevitably !
be directed against bim. For this reason
it is conceded tbat already there bave
been many desertions from the ranks of
Mr. Pbelan, and it is held that these rotes
will go to Mr. Dimond.
Altogether it is a pretty fightâ just such
a tight as the Democrats of ian Francisco
seem te like. Tbe benelit which the peo-
I-le will reap from, this contest will be tbe
election of C. L. Taylor, tbe Republican
nominee for Mayor, who is known to be
capable of guiding oar municipal ship
aright, whether the; charter be adopted
or not!
Ed Lanigan, who holds down s desk !
ia the office of the Collector of Internal
Revenue during the brief periods he is
able to spare from political affairs, has
not improved his popularity during the
past few months. Mr. Lanigan was
conspicuous on tne floor of tbe Junta
Democratic convention, and it was quite j
loudly asserted by those whom he did not !
indorse tbat be had Jaid himself liable to
dismissal from the Federal brigade under i
the operation of the civil service rules.
Nothing of consequence came of this
growl, however, but there is serious dan
ger ahead for Mr. Lanigan if he persists '
in his present political tactics for the ad- j
vancement of tbe interests of his personal !
representatives on the Junta ticket.
Mr. Lanigan is conceded to be the die- |
tator of three nominations for Super- j
visors, namely, Haskins, Sheehan and I
BritU AÂ§ Mr. Lanigan gave these
men their places on the ticket it
i.< supposed tbat he considers him
self able to control their votes if they
â¢bOOld happen to be elected. In this he !
may be mistaken, as tbe gentlemen are
credited with being of moie than ordinary
intelligence and independence. Up to the
present, however, they have done nothing
to undeceive Mr. Lani an in his assump
tion that he is to act as a steering com
mittee for them in municipal legislation,
and be is working for them day and night
as if his political salvation depended on
their success.
Saco Rainey, in partnership with John
Daggett of the United States Mint, is said
to own the remainder of tbe Junta super
visorial ticket, so when you hear em
ployes of the Mint shouting for Rainey's
candidates you may understand that their
violation of civil service rules, prohibiting
offensive partisanship, will meet with the
approval of their superior.
John Feeny, who is running for State
Senator in the Twenty-fiftn Senatorial
District, is another of Mr. Daggett's ad
herents. Whether elected or not he is
sure of a place in the Mint, so long as Mr.
Daguett has the say.
Rainey is just at present devoting the
greater portion of his time and attention
to mapping out tbe campaign for his su
pervisorial candidates. After he gets tbat
matter arranged to his satisfaction he
may give some of the other candidates a
lift, but at all times the weigbt of his
energies and influence will be tnrown in
the balance for his would-be Supervisors.
The public will understand Rainey's
particular anxiety ior the election of his
Supervisors when it is explained that
mere are two Fire Commissioners to be
chosen by tbe next Board of Supervisors,
and if Rainey should lose bis grip in that
direction ha might as well retire from the
political arena so far as "practical" re

Democrats have practically abandoned

they feel the conditions to be against
them. D. A. MacdonaJd, tbe nominee of

an alarminp way. Mr- Ambrose has
the honor of holding a nomination from
tbe Junta Democrats, but probably be

George P. Wetmore will poll a very lieht

ihe Kelly nomination conferred on him
that be cannot expect to make any kind

George W. Elder, the regular Republican
nominee, who will poll the full vote of his

ought to be, since he wil I save from $50,

SHE WANTED A PISTOL
Mrs. Maria Fay Creates a Scene
in Justice Kerrigan's
Court.
Begged for Something With Which to
Shoot a Witness on the
Stand.
Mrs. Maria Fay created a sensation in
Justice Kerrigan's court yesterday by de
manding a pistol with which to shoot a
witness in a case in which she is the de
fendant.
No one seeming willing to aid ber in her
sanguinary designs, she became hysterical,
and when the man wbo had aroused ber
ire left the witness-stand she flew at him
and he only escaped by a rapid exit into
the corridor.
The plaintiff in the case is one McFad
den, wbo is the assignee of Louis Helbing,
a brother of Mrs. Fay. Helbing borrowed
(500 from Mrs. Fay some time ago, and
later, as sne claims, wiien sbe received his
portion of a legacy from Germany she ap
plied the amountâ ll70 â to tbe debt.
When disputes over money matters
arose Heloing demanded his share of tbe
windfall, and when told that it had been
taken as part payment of tbe $r>o"> debt re
fused to accept any such arrangement,
saying that the debt was outlawed. The
suit was for the legacy.
The amount of hard swearing on both
sides mystified even the Justice, but noth
ing really sensational developed until
Helbing called on John Gorman to testify
in his behalf. In explaining how he came
to snow any thins; about tbe transactions
between Helbing and Mrs. Fay he said
tbat he hsd sustained such close relations
with the latter that she had told him all
about it.
His testimony was of such a character
as to cause the defendant, a respectaDle
appearing. middle-aged woman, to become
faint and then furious with anger and she
created tbe scene mentioned.
Helbing is tbe man who was convicted
of tapping tba Spring Valley mains in the
Mission several years ago and sentenced
to a term in the Co-unty Jail. Gorman is
an elevator man in the Chronicle building.
The Judge took the matter under consid
eration.

EDWARDS IS ALIVE.
The Man Asphyxiated Last Monday
Kifbt Turns Ont to Be John
Armstrong.
Another case of mistaken identity bas de
veloped at the Morgue. It appears that
tbe Lewis Edwards who was found dead
In a room on Jessie street is not Ed
wards at all, but John Armstrong, a tailor,
who formealy worked on Howard street,
near Fifth. By the supposed Edwards'
side was a woman so nearly dead that for
hours her life was despaired of.
Yesterday the genuine Lewis Edwards
walked into the Morgue and startled Dep
uty Coroner McCormick by asking, "How
do I look when I am dead?" Then the
whole stoty came out. It seems tbat Ed
wards and the woman lived together for
something over six months as husband
and wife. In May last tbe husband grew
tired of his bargain and tbe two separated.
Since then he has seen her only upon a
few occasions, when she sought him to
borrow money. Edwards accounts for tbe
mistake on the woman's part on tbe
ground tbat when sbe recovered conscious
ness her recoil ctions of tbe night before
were somewhat clon-'ed.
The real Lewis Edwards lires at 739

PUBLIC OPINION
FOR PROTECTION
What Banker Hellman
Learned on a Trip to
the East
Major McKinley the Favorite
Among All Conditions
of Voters.
HE WILL REVIVE BtTSIKESS.
The Feeling in New York and Else
where Among Large Numbers of
Old-Line Democrats.
I. W. Hellman of the Bank of Nevada
has returned after an extended visit to
Europe and the Eastern States, in both of
which places he took notes of the political
feeling and tbe prospects.
He found that public sentiment in tbe
East was strongly in favor of McKinley
and protection. In fact, he found this
sentiment so strong tbat it was tbe gen
eral opinion, especially in New York
State, that Major McKinley would be
elected beyond a doubt.
Both tbe silver and protection issues are
discussed with about the same interest.
Tbe question of free coinage is uppermost
in Wall street and other financial centers,
while the business men, the shopkeepers,
laborers and mechanics are more inter
ested in the issue of protection than in
any other. They believe or rather they
know that protection will start the wDeels
of industry turning. Those wheels in
turn will unlock the vaults wherein are
stored the millions of idle capital await
ing investment.
They remember that under Harrison's
administration and up to the time oi the
advent of Grover Cleveland and tbe Wil
son act the factories were so many hives
of industry and every man had work, and
that with the striking down of protection
the Industrial armies, with their Coxeys
and Debses came into existence for the
first time in the history of the American
continent.
"There is no question in my mind."
added Mr. Hellman, "that the election of
Major McKinley will improve business all
over this country and that a very large
number of tbe men out of employment in
this country will be employed in the mills
and factories. If Mr. McKinley be beaten
the reverse of this condition of affairs will
be witnessed, because confidence will be
so shaken that thousands of people now
in employment will be thrown out of em
ployment. This will come about by reason
of the lack of protection against the com
petition of the cheap pauper-labor prod
ucts of Europe.
"It is the fact that in the event of the
election of Mr. Bryan a great deal of tbe
capital now in the factories and other
capital which would be invested there will
remain dormant.
"The American people want protection,
ana they want it more in some States than
in others. California certainly requires
protection, and the silver question which
is made such a bugbear here is misunder
stood. Our factories to-day, here and in
the East, are languishing and unable to
run because they cannot compete with the
cheap labor of Europe and because they
have not had the protection wnich they
should have. Onr imports are increasing
and our exports are decreasing. Instead
of exchanging products for products we
are buying products from Europe and pay
ing gold for them.
"The reduction of the surplus under
President Cleveland's administration was
brought about by a falling off in the reve
nue. The Democratic tariff has reduced
the income of the Government so much
that it will be obliged to borrow money or
to increase the rate of internal revenue
taxation. The alternative is a higher
tariff, against which the Democrats are
I'ledced.
"Mr. McKinley, beyond all question, is
the stronger candidate of the two. I have !
fornd a great many of the old-line Demo
crats who say they will vote for McKin
ley, and there is a much larger number of
them than the public has any idea of."

Monotony of a Regents' Meeting
Broken by Governor
Budd.
A SCANDAL ABOUT WAIVEKS.
Judge Wallace Hears That Contrac
tors Are to Pay the Archi
tect's Fees.
Governor Budd enlivened the session of
the University Regents yesterday. He was
late in arriving at the Mark Hopkins Insti
tute, but was not long in catching up with
the proceedings. The regents there were:
Timothy Guy Phelps (presiding), J. West
Martin, Colonel C. F. Crocker, Judge Wil
liam T. Wallace, President Kellogg, John
E. Budd, A. S. Hallidie, Albert Miller, E.
F. Denicke, J. A. Wayinire, J. B. Rein
stein, George T. Marye and Mr. Chase of
the State Board of Agriculture.
The president of the university was pre
senting a request that Professor C. M.
Galen be allowed leave of absence for a
year without loss of pay, when the Gover
nor broke the monotony by demanding a
report from the committee on buildings
and grounds. The members of this com
mittee are J. Wesc Martin, J. B. Reinstein
and John E. Budd.
Regent Mar tin, as chairman of the com
mittee, said it was nis turn to speak. He
occupied a position at one end of the long
table and the Governor a place at the
other end. Tnere was a momentary pause
aud each glared at the other. Mr. Martin
broke the silence by saying :
"The committee has no report to
make."
Governor Budd responded:
"I have something to say. I would liice
to ask yon, sir, if the contracts for the
building of the affiliated colleges have
been signed r"
J. West Martinâ Two of the contracts
have been signed â one of the Ray Con
struction Company for the granite work
and one for tue carpenter work. The com
mittee suspended work bearing that you,
sir, had declared the whole proceeding il
legal. Regent Reinstein has possession of
the contracts.
The Governor replied with some warmth
that he had not declared the proceedings
illegal. He said: "The contracts are not
binding until the Attorney-General has
approved them. The time for the execu
tion ot the contract under the agreement
with Mr. Sutro expired October 8. Now,
sir, it was published in the papers that
these contracts were signed by the com
mittee. lam a member of the committee
on building and grounds by virtue of a
resolution of this board. My brother,
John E. Budd, is also a member. I had
no notice of the committee meeting, and
he had no notice of it. If the contracts
have not been signed the State has lost its
right to the Sutro lot."
J. West Martin arose in his place and as
serted that the board authorized the com
mittee to sign the contracts on the return
of the papers from Sacramento. The
usual course was followed, but the com
mittee suspended action after the con
tracts were siened.
Governor Buddâ l complain that the
chairman did not notify me or my brother
of the meeting. The Budds are numerous
this year, you know.
Regent Martinâ You were in the Yo
semite Valley.
Governor Budd â I was attending to my
duty there, and did it.
Recent Martinâ l do not doubt it.
Governor Budd (turning to Mr. Rein
stein) â Did I not say to you in the Palace
Hotel that the chairman did not notify
me of the meeting?
Mr. Reinsteinâ There was a meeting of
this committee in my office.
Governor (to Secretary Bonte) â Was my
brother notified of this meeting?
Secretary Bonte looked up, but didn't
catch up.
Regent Reinstein (resuming)â There
was a meeting of all the contractors and
Attorney Mnoon at my office. We sub
mitted to the Attorney-General the form
of the contract and he said it was all
right. The contracts were held by me to
investigate the responsibility of bonds
men.
Governor Budd â A regent from the
country is just as much entitled to a no
tice of a meeting as a cityfied man is.
The Governor read lrom the rules re
garding notice for meetings, and held that
the meeting to consider the contracts was
illegal. "I deny that the contract is
made. It must be submitted to the Board
of Regents."
Recent Martinâ Can it be submitted
to-day ?
Governor Budd â It is too late. I don't
care whether the meeting was held in
Berkeley, Oakland, New Ycrk or in Rein
stein's office, the members of the com
mittee should have been notified.
At this stage of the proceedings Judge
Wallace intervened, laying: "The only
thing that defeats the contract is the non
observance oi a rule of the board. We
should not allow our own rules to defeat a
transaction of this importance."
Governor Budd â But the contract is not
completed. The Attorney-General has
never indorsed his approval on this con
tract, as the law requires.
Attorney Mboon interposed to say that
the Attorney-General could not approve
the contract until it was executed.
Governor Budd then questioned the
right of the Regents under the law to
accept the waiver of architect's fees and
the gift of Dr. Beverly Cole in order to
bring the cost of the building within the
appropriation.
Regent Martin insisted with a deal of
emphasis that the advice of the attorney
of the board had been strictly followed.
The Governor remarked that the Su
preme Court might determine the ques
tion of law before the money expended.
"We are in a legal tangle here that I see
no way out of unless the legal acumen of
Judge Wallace can pull us through."
Judge Waymire said if Sutro did not
objecT to the proceedings no one else
should object.
Judge Wallace arose and aston shed the
board'by this statement: "Now I under
stand, as a matter of fact, and 1 believe
the public should know the facts, that the
architect has not thrown off his fees, but
that the contractors have agreed to pay
him."
Regent Hallidie was on his feet at once.
He said: "I am getting some more light
on this case. If the architect is being
paid by the contractors the Regents are
placed in a false position. It would be
difficult for an architect in the pay of the
contractors to perform bis duty."
Dr. Beverly Cole immediately stepped
forward aud said that the contractors
were not to pay the architect. He waa
responsible to the architect for the fees.
Governor Budd returned to the fray
again, asserting: "While I want the
building constructed on the site selected I
do not see how it can be done in view of
these waivers and donations. I was de
ceived and the board was deceived by the
architects as to the cost of the building.
If we had known at Sacramento of this
juggling with architects we should not
nave approved the proceedings."
The sensation of the day then came in a
reference to Folsom granite. The Gov
ernor went straight to the point, saying:
"You assured the Board of State Prison
Directors that the use of tne granite de
sired was for the sole benefit of the Affili
ated Colleges. How did it happen that toe
successful bidder only bad notice of the
cut rate for Folsom granite? What angel
whispered it into bis ear?
Regent Reinstein â It was known to all
the bidders that Folsom granite might be
obtained for a certain price.
Architect Kraft said that all the bidders
understood that Folsom granite could be
used.
The Governor demanded to know if
Folsom granite was mentioned in the
specifications.
The architect said it was not in the
specification t.
Governor Budd â Folsom prison will not
enter into competition with labor of the
State more than is necessary.
Tnere was more talk, and finally an
agreement was made to refer everything
to the law and buildings committee, with
instructions for the committee to submit a
report next Tuesday.
Regent C. F. Crocker then bad some
thing serene and delightful to offer. He
moved a vote of thanks to Miss Rose
Whiting of Plymouth, Mass., who had
given 150 volumes to the library. The
thanks were voted. Colonel Crocker, em
boldened by his success, moved that an
appropriation of $209 be authorized to buy
books in Shanghai for the Oriental class
of the university. The purchase was
authorized.
The salary of the foreman of the croundu
at Berkeley was raised $10 a month.
George Hanson has resigned his position
as foreman of the Amador station. The
vacancy was not filled.
S. D. Ayer, foreman of the Paso Robles
station, also resigned. The board ap
pointed F. D. Frosh of the Paso Robles
Bank to fill the vacancy.
Professor Plane submitted a chart
which shows on its face that the increase
of students at the university since 1879
has been 500 per cent, while the increase
of revenue under the 1-cent tax has been
only 60 per cent.
Mr. Hallidie said the diagram was one
of the most striking things ever presented.
He thought it should be reduced to one
fourth cf its size and lithographed.
Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson, U. S. A.,
presented an application to command the
battalion at the university at the expira
tion of Lieutenant Winn's term of service.
Referred.
When nearly all the members had gone
President Kellogg moved for an executive
session. It transpired that sewer gas had
found its way into the rooms of one of the
professors, and the secret session was
called to consider the expenditure of
money from the sanitation fund to divert
tbe poisoned atmosphere into another
direction. The proceedings were brief,
but the president had tbe joy of a brief
session with closed doors.
FRAUD IS CHARGED.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of J. W.
Woods, a Youth "Wiih an In- m
enviable Reputation.
E. W. Wilkinson, proprietor of the East
lake Hotel, Webster and Bay streets, swore
to a complaint in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday charging J. W. Woods with de
frauding him out of $75 for board and lodg
ing.
Woods is a young man with an unen
viable reputation. In August last he mar
ried Alice Kerrigan, a pretty girl 18 years
of age. After living with her for about a
month he deserted her and eloped with
Johanna Snyder, another young girl.
The couple went to Salinas, and a few
â¢days later Woods was arrested there for
vagrancy. The parents of the Snyder girl
were too poor to pay her fare back to the
City, and the Salinas authorities procured
her ticket and sent her home. Woods had
meantime been set free, and he met tbe
train on which the girl was riding at
Pajaro, a station near Watsonville. He
induced her to go with him, and it is now
believed they are in Santa Cruz.
Woods had lived in the Eastlake Hotel
for about a year previous to his escapades.
CAN RACE IN CALIFORNIA,
Will Wallace Will Bring His
String of Cracks Out This
Way.
Notified by the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club That His Entries Will
Be Rec-ived.
Will Wallace, the boon companion and
running mate of Plunger Riley Grannan,
will race his string of horses in California
this winter. When the American Jockey
Club ruled Riley Grannan off the track
under its control and notified Will Wal
lace that his entries would no longer be
received, the young Kentucky owner was
evidently perplexed as to how the Califor
nia racing associations would act on the
ruling. Yesterday Secretary Leake of the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club received a tele
gram from Wallace asfcing whether he
could have eight stalls at Ingleside track.
After summing up the ruling of the
Jockey Club, Secretary Leake decided, as
no mention of fraud was made in connec
tion with the running of Wallace's horses,
there was no valid reason for excluding
him from California tracks, and answered
in the affirmative.
Local race-goers will now have an op
portunity of judging how good a stake
horse The Winner is. And the others
in the string will no doubt be capa
ble of holding their own. This de
cision of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club
will probably result in again tempting
Riley Grannan to try his luck on our
shores.
Secretary Leake announced himself as
greatly pleased at the way the stake en
tries were coming in. burns and Water
house made fifty-seven nominations.
They include eipht for the Spreckels cup,
eight in the California Derby, five in the
California Oaks, two in the Ingleside
stake, one in the California stake, three in
the Palace Hotel handicap, eight in the
G. H. Mumm <fe Co. stake, eight in the
Pommery Sec handicap, four in the Tar
pey handicap, seven in the Crocker stake
and three in the Hobart stake.
A. B. Spreckels, president of the Ingle
side Association, was also a liberal nomi
nator, with twenty-four entries to his
credit. M. F. Tarpey, a member of the
board of directors, made six entries for the
different stakes. -Mr. Tarpey's colors have

THB SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1896.
COLONEL TAYLOR'S INTENTIONS
The Regular Republican Nominee for Mayor Tells What
He Will Do If Elected.
I have been asked what I would do if elected Mayor of the City?
First â I would say if the new charter should pass I would exercise the utmost care
in the selection of appointees to the various offices to be provided for thereunder,
carefully considering the capacity and integrity of each applicant for position. If the
charter should not pass I would do my best to have all laws operating against the in
terest of the taxpayers of this City repealed and to have others passed in the interest
of economy, especially in our system of assessing and collecting personal property
taxes; also our fee system. By the action of the last Legislature the expenses in the
former and the decrease in revenue in the latter amounts to over $100,000, besides the
inconvenience.
Second â I would use my influence in favor of acquiring a fair percentage of the
earnings on all franchises hereafter granted by the City paid into the City treasury.
If such a system had been put in operation on tne granting of the many franchises
now in existence in this City there would be a revenue coming into the treasury that
would materially reduce the burthen of taxation.
I would favor establishing a sewer system that would be economical and lasting.
I would favor the removing of all worn-out cobbles from the streets and replacing
the same with bitumen or some otner approved form of pavement, where the grade
will permit (otherwise basalt blocks), as fast as possible.
lam in favor of maintaining good roads to the county line. I would favor main
taimng an efficient Fire Department and a good police force, as these are two im
portant branches of our City government,
I think the Golden Gate Park should be maintained in its present excellent condi
tion with a liberal allowance. I am in favor of improving all of the parks, squares
and plazas of the City.
lam opposed to any increase of license upon any character of business. lam in
favor of a vigorous prosecution for the possession of all the land belonging to the
City. lam in favor of an economical, progressive municipal government and that
there shall be no money squandered by extravagant appropriations, which often leads
to waste. C. L. TAYLOR.
EX-MAYOR DAVIS
ON PROTECTION
Addressed an Overflowing
Audience in the Audi
torium.
Pertinent Illustration of Imagin
ary Free Coinage in Santa
Rosa.
TOWN SOLD AT HALF-PRICE.
Another Object Lesson of Gold Going
Up aid Horses Going Down
Without the Bicycle.
Ex-Congressman W. H. Stowell of Min
nesota, who was announced to speak in
the Auditorium last night, was present,
but was suffering from a severe cold con
tracted in the oppressive and effete
climate of the East, and was therefore un-
EX-MAYOR DAVIS Exposing the Incapacity of the Democratic
Administration*
able to address the meeting. Ex-Mayor
W. R. Davis of Oakland, announced to
speak with him, not only fulfilled his part
of the contract, but kindly entertained the
audience until after 10 o'clock, so that his
hearers might not suffer any disappoint
ment by reason of Mr, Stowell's indispo
sition.
Judge J. A. Waymire presided over the
meeting, which was a large one, every seat
in the Auditorium being occupied.
Mr. Davis began his address by taking
up the anarchistic planks in the Chicago
platform, dwelling at considerable length
on the planks rebuking the President for
calling out the Federal troops during the
great railroad strike of 1894 and denounc
ing the Supreme Court. He took up Mr.
Bryan's so-called arguments on the same
points and exposed them as the make
shifts of a demagogue.
â¢'When you hear these arguments and
turn to those advanced by the man from
Ohio, Major McKinley, you enter the do
main of reason," added Mr. Davis.
"It shows the difference between a man
who talks with his thinker and him who
thinks with his talker.'' [Applause.]
The speaker added that no woman in
the audience would buy dry goods from a
man who used three different lengths for
the measure of a yard. The ?aÂ«ne with
weights. A pound weight must weigh a
pound whether it be of gold, silver or
brass. This illust ration was used to ex
pose the falla cy cf a double standard.
"The silver dollar," he said, "has in it
so many grains of silver, which according
lo intrinsic value ;s worth only 50 cents,
and its Government backing is worth 50
cents, making its value $1. The gold dol
lar is worth a dollar with or without Gov
ernment backing. [Applause.]
"The present market rate of silver to
gold is 32 to 1, and this truthfully repre
dents the relative value of the metals.
The Government of the United States has
lost $145,000,000 of the people's money by
buying silver bullion from the mine
owners since 1873 because of the deprecia
tion of silver to the present low market
price. Where," he asked, "has this Gov
ernment paid out $145,000,000 to any other
industry in the United States?
"The main point of the free-coinage
scheme is that the coin shall be legal
tender for all debts, public and private.
Nobody outside of the United States can
be compelled to accept a dollar of this
money. It will compel only one nation
in the world to accept a metal at double
its market value, and that nation will be
the United States.
"It is the duty of every nation to care
for the welfare of its people. Hence Bis
marcK has expressed himself in favor of
the free coma c of silver because Germany
owns a large numner of silver mines, and
Germany would like this nation to bVgin
the experiment of attempting to double
the value of that metal.
"Who will be paid with this inflated
money? Much talk is heard of the mil
lions hoarded by the banks in the coun
try, when the fact is, that the bankers do
not own that money, but, on the contrary,
i' represents the savings of the depositors
who own it. There are 10 000,000 savings
bank depositors in the United States and
10,000,000 life insurance policies. In addi
tion, there are nearly 1,000,000 persons
representing the heroes of the Civil War,
and an exalted candidate for President
proposes to sign a bill to pay those old
boys and their children half a dollar on
the dollar for what is due them for their
bravery and patriotism.
"It may almost seem forgetfulness on
my part not to have said anything about
the Republican candidate. It is not neces
sary. He is the one who, at 18 years of
age, shouldered a musket and marched
bravely to the defense of the Union when
it was imperilled," continued the speaker.
This remark evoked a storm of applause.
The speaker, by way of illustration,
imagined the city of Santa Rosa to coin
dollars at the ratio of 16 to 1 without the
agreement of the remaining cities of the
United States. People in San Francisco
and Oakland bought bullion in Mexico
and in Colorado at 32 to 1, the present
market rate, had it coined into Santa
Rosa dollars at 16 to 1, and with that
money bought up all the goods, houses
and real estate in the city of Santa Rosa.
Then when the San.a Rosans went to
Oakland to buy themselves homes and
tendered their cheap dollars in payment
the money was refused and they were
obliged to sell their dollars at the market
bullion value of 32 to 1. It was then that
they realized that they had sold them
selves out at 50 cents on the dollar.
Mr. Davis predicted that a similar fate
would befall the United States if they at
tempted to inflate the value of silver by
free-coinage legislation.
A striking picture was drawn of the
financial failure of the Democratic admin
istration. When li rover Cleveland took
his seat but little more than three years
ago, the Republican administration
turned over to him $126,000,000. and the
Democratic administration has injured
the credit and exhausted the resources of
the country to the extent of $388,000,000.
"And yet," continued Mr. Davis, "they
talk to us about finance!" [Laughter.]
The subject of protection was taken up
next and was illustrated with copious quo
tations from Government official reports
showing the importations into Great Brit
ain of wool and wheat from parts of the
world other than the United Slates. The
reason for the decline in the price of
wheat, he said, was the greater and
cheeper production of that grain in the
fields of India, Russia and the Argentine
Republic.
"Some of those Democratic 16 to 1 men,"
he remarked, "said that the price of wheat
had not cone down, but the price of gold
had gone up. It is just as if the livery stable
proprietor should say: 'Oh, no; the price
of horses has not gone down, but gold has
gone up, and the bicycle has had nothing
to do with it. "
Placed on the Ballot.
The Citizens' Republican party ticket
was placed on the official ballot yesterday
by Registrar Hinton, no protest against
the acceptance of the same having been
filed.
DUCK AND QUAIL.
Sportsmen Who Will Take Advantage
of the First Day of the Season.
Judging from the demand at tbe gun
stores for ammunition it would appear as if
a large army of sportsmen will be out on
Thursday, which is the first day of the
shooting season, in quest of auck and
quail,
A large percentage of the lovers of the
chsse will journey to the Suisun marshes,
where wild ducks are very plentiful this
year. McÃae and Menkle" have a splen
didly furnished ark at the "Drawbridge"
for the accommodation of duck-shooters.
Among those who will avail themselves of
the opportunity for a first-class outing are
Tom Sharkey, the pugilist, and Young
Mitchell, the champion middle-weight of
California.
Mr. Pacheco of Ignacio writes to the
sporting editor that owing to the damage
he sustained last season by having his
fences broken he will cause the arrest of
all hunters who trespass upon his land
this year without permission.
Good duck-snooting should be had this
year on the Alviso marshes. Latest re
ports from there state that mallard aud
sprig are very plentiful and that the out
look for large bags of game is excellent.
Quail are also plentiful this year. Quite
a number of sportsmen will tramp the
hills of Marin County on Thursday. The
Country and Tamalpais gun clubs have
made great preparations for a shoot on
the opening day.
ORGANIZED LAWYERS
ENTER POLITICS
The Bar Association Will
Recommend Four Su
perior Judges.
The Movement Prevailed in the
Face of Strong Oppo
sition.
DISSATISFACTION THE RESULT.
A Committee Appointed to Fix the
Time at Which Bal'ots Shall
Be Returned.
A special meeting of the Bar Associa
tion was called yesterday to determine
whether the association should recommend
four out of the total number of candidates
nominated for Superior Judges. Though
there was a diversity of opinion among
the members present the proponents of
the nlan were slightly in the majority and
they triumphed.
About twenty-five members were pres
ent at the meeting. Attorney William
Thomas was the prime mover in the
matter and was strongly seconded by Dr.
E. R. Taylor and S. W. Holladay. The
opposition was mustered under Judge A.
L. Rhodes and attorneys J. A. Wright and
T. Carl Spelling. Judge Louderback also
protested against the movement.
Thomas brought in a resolution that the
association should vote by ballots mailed
to a committee to be appointed by the
president and that the committee should
report the result to the president, giving
the names of those who bad received either
a majority or a plurality of all the votes
cast.
Spelling advanced the argument that
there were a great number of worthy can
didates on the various tickets and that it
would degrade the association to bring it
into local politics at this time. He
thought the movement a mere scheme of
certain members to place in the hands of
their favorites electioneerinaptreapons in
the form of certificates of recommenda
tion, which did not represent the real sen
timents of more than a small minority,
and that the action of the association and
its character wou.d be attacked as a nat
ural result by all those who were not so
favored.
Judge Rhodes objected on the ground
that such action, if taken at ai), shonld
have been taken before the political con
ventions met and nominated candidates.
Then the movement might have resulted
in bringing the best men forward.
Holladny contended that it was the very
purpose of the Bar Association to partici
pate in the election of Judges, and that if
the members of the bar outside the asso
ciation did not like it they could hold a
meeting of their own and take any action
they saw fit.
Dr. Taylor, W. S. Goodfellow and
Columbus Bartlett were appointed a com
mittee to give notice and collect the bal
lots. The committee was given full
power to fix the time at which the ballots
should be returned.
The opposition is very much nettled at
the action taken, and the end is not yet.
The committee will require a week to col
lect and distribute the ballots and deter
mine the result.

GRANITE HOTEL
FOR YOSEMITE
One to Cost Between $40,000
and $50,000 to Be
Built.
The Project Broached by Gov
ernor Budd to the Com
mission.
DILEMMA OF THE VALLEY.
Short of Accommodations for Tourists.
A Bid That Excited Wrath.
Awards of Privileges.
All the so-called hotels, cottages, tents
and other makeshifts provided for the ac
commodation of visitors to the Yosemite
Valley are to give way in the near future
to a handsome, imposing and fireproof
structure, to be built at a cost of about
$50,000 of granite to be quarried in the
valley. This project was developed yes
terday at the meeting of the Yosemite
Commissioners during the discussion of
plans to provide for the accommodation
of visitors to the valley.
J. J. Cook, the former lessee of the
Stoneman House, gave it as his opinion
that the fire had been caused by the wood
imbedded in the concrete chimneys be
coming charred and afterward breaking
into flame. There was no fire, he stated,
in the hotel for seven hours before the
building was discovered to be on fire. He
added that it had been on fire four times
previously.
Since the burning of the Stoneman
House tnere is practically no accommo
dation for touristÃ and during the dis
cussion of that subject a communication
from Secretary Sheehan to the Governor
was read. He said these projects regard
ing the accommodation of visitors during
the coming- season had been considered by
the committee on tenements and build
ings:
Firstâ The rehabilitating of the old Hutch
ings house opposite the Sentinel Hotel.
Secondâ The guardian's office could be reno
vated and repaired and converted into twelve
or fourteen sleeping-rooms by constructing a
partition through the center.
Thirdâ The Sinning house, in which Mr. At
kinson lives, could be fined up and converted
into a cottage for guests with little expense.
Fourthâ The Sentinel Hotel will require ad
ditional baths and heating apparatus and toi
lets must be provided for the outlying build
ings.
Fifthâ Another proposition is to construct
entirely new cottages in the vicinity of the
Sentinel Hotel.
Continuing the letter said :
Should this needed work be delayed until
next spring it is extremely doubtful if the re
pairs and improvements could be made in
time to accommodate next Reason's travel in
the valley. It is therefore deemed a case of
urgency, aud your views upon this subject are
earnestly solicited.
To this the Governor had returned the
following reply:
Your favor of September 22 to hand. I be
lieve, as does Commissioner Clinch, that esti
mates should be made by a competent archi
tect of the cost of the alterations suggested by
you, together with rough draughts thereof, for
the guidance of the commission. I would not
have detail plans, specifications or estimates
made until the board had knowledge of the es
timated cost, and would contract with an
architect, before his trip of examination, as
to the cost of the preliminary work.
A. a. Glasscock, the lessee of the Cen
tral Hotel, suggested fci at his place be
improved so as to afford the desired ac
commodation. He stated it would not
cost to exceed $3EOO to do the necessary
work of raising the roof and making: otner
improvements to increase tne facilities of
the building. But this the Governor
would not listen to. He had bad enough
of guesswork estimates.
Then Governor Budd made a suggestion
which appnrently caught the fancy of
every Commissioner.
"I am in favor of a granite building that
can be constructed from stone right on the
ground," he said. "I don't believe it
would cost more than to build an equally
larpe hotel of lumber up there in the
mountains, where the hauling of the lum
ber costs more than the lumber itself."
Commissioner Sperry said that a granite
structure with 100 rooms could be put up
at a cost of $40,000 to $50,000. He sug
gested that plans ought to be secured to
enable a proper presentation of the scheme
to the Leeislature when an appropriation
was asked for. Such a plan, he stated,
would not cost more than $150 or $200.
Resolutions of eulogy of John H. O'Brien,
a deceased member of the commission,
were adopted.
Awards for the next year were then
made. The first bid read raised a small
whirlwind of wrath and indignation.
James McCauley, lessee of the Glacier
Point Hotel, in a written communication
recited that he had built the hotel seven
teen years ago at a cost of $400; that the
State had spent $1500 recently in improv
ing his property, and that he would spend
$2000 more if the commission would give
him a lease for ten years at $50 a year and
agree to pay him $5000 for his equity at
the expiration of the lease, or some sum
to be fixed by appraisement.
This so stirred the Governor's wrath
that he declared McCauley would have to
abandon both his claim to any compensa
tion for his "equity" and his lease. The
other members, however, thought he
ought to be shown some consideration,
and the matter of the claim was referred
to the committee on finance. He was
then granted a year's lease of the prop
erty for $100 for the term.
Other leases were granted for a year in
each case, as follows: To Coffman *<fe Ken
nev, for the livery privileges in the valley,
$750; to the Yosemite Stage Company, for
operating a stage line in the valley, $150;
to Mrs. Cavagnaro, for keeping a store
$120. Several other minor privileges were
also granted for a year, after which the
commission adjourned.
After the meeting Governor Budd stated
he would, in his message to the Legisla
ture, call attention to the proposition of
the granite hotel for the valley.

TREE
PLANTING IN GOLDEN
GATE PARK
The ceremony of planting thirteen his- ]
toric trees, one from each of the thirteen I
original States of the Union under the
auspices of Sequoia Chapter, Daughters of
the American Revolution, composed of
many of the prominent ladies of this City
and State, who have banded together to
T>erpetnate the memory and the spirit of
the men and women wUo achieved Ameri
can independence and to foster true
patriotism and love of country and aid in
securing for mankind all the blessings of
liberty, will take place at half-past 2
o'clock next Monday afternoon in Concert
Valley, in Golden Gate Park, on the site
of tte old '49 Mining Camp of the Mid
winter Fair.
The idea of planting the trees in the
shape of an arch was suggested by Mrs.
Peter J. Hnghes, the corresponding secre
tary of Marion Chapter, Daughters of the
Americas Revolution, of Pennsylvania,
and wife of a prominent lawyer of Phila
delphia. The ladies of Sequoia Chapter
selected the one hundred and fifteenth an
niversary of the surrender of Cornwallis
at Yorktown, Va., as the day for the
planting.
The programme of exercises will in
clude music by the Angel Island band,

is expected that the occasion will attract !
a large number of people.
In the planting of the trees there will be
used a silver trowel, the handle of which

is of the wood of the magnolia tree
planted by George Washington at Mount
Vernon.
Among the participants on the occasion
will be the recently organised Valentine
Holt Society of the Children of the Ameri
can Revolution, that will plant a young
oak at the point in the arch assigned to
Connecticut. The tree is the gift to the
juvenile society of Marion Burgess Hough
of Hartford, 12 years of age, a lineal de
scendant in the eleventh generation from
Governor Bradford of Mayflower fame;
also from Edward Winslow, the third
Governor of Massachusetts, from John
Hayne, the first coionial Governor of Con
necticut, also from Martha Pit kin. who,
as a maid of 20, was Known in tradition
ary lore as the "Connecticut catch" and
who married Simon Walcott, from which
union sprang seven colonial governors.
This tree, which is not a foot high, is from
an acorn from a scion of the historic char
ter oak. That venerable tree in Bushnell
Park was broken off seven feet above the
ground by a gale in 1856. The little tree,
which may be designated cs the "grand
child of the parent tree," was raised by
the little girl who sent it, and it will be 1
year old on tne sth of next month.
"The historic trees that have been con
tributed by jire chapters In the different
States," said Sirs. Hubbard, the registrar of
the chapter, "are a cypress from Pennsylvania

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1896.
WHY THE MILL
RAN BEHIND
The San Quentin Factory
as a Victim of Free
Trade.
Governor Budd's Criticisms
Arouse the Ire of the
Superintendent.
A TARIFF OBJECT LESSON.
Even Convict Labor Cannot Stand the
Stress of Cheap Cooly
Competition.
The criticisms of Governor Bcdd upon
the output of the jute mills at San Quen
tin has aroused the ire of Superintendent
John Rutherford. He says that the mill
is doing as well as can be expected, and
were the old duty on grain bags again in
force the mill would once more become a
paying institution.
Formerly there was a duty of lji cents
on each grainbag that came into this port.
San Quentin made bags were then selling
for 4 2-10 cents, or 1 2-10 cents over the
cost of the jute that was used in their
manufacture. The duty kept out foreign
bags, and the supply and demand were
well adjusted.
But when the Wilson tariff bill passed
and the protecting 1% cents was taken
from foreign bags Calcutta immediately
began to flood the market. Indian grain
bags came over by the million, the market
was overstocked, prices wenrf every way,
and not being able to sell its output, the
San Quintiu mill had to face the alterna
tive of adding to its stocK on band or par
tially closing down.
Then it was, says Mr. Rutherford, we
decided to introduce the manufacture of
sugar bags as well as grain bags. These
are of a much finer texture and much
more caro is necessary in the work, there
fore the output became smaller in "yard
age," for the finer the work tbe smaller
the result For the six months ending
June, 1896, the superintendent says the
consumption of jute was greater than that
of the corresponding period in 1896, al
though the output was apparently less.
"It was tbe tariff, or the need of it, that
caused the trouble," said tbe superintend
ent yesterday, "just as it has closed the
Oakland jute mills and is closing the cot
ton and woolen mills."
The import of bags fiom India, he says,
is 12,000,000 a year. These are all sold at
the same price as the home-made bags,
and the market is just that much over
stocked. With burlap, the cloth for mak
ing bags, the Indian article is sold here at
nearly half of what it can be made for by
home factories. As a result the manufac
ture of burlap at the San Quentin mill has
stopped altogether, except when some spe
cial order comes in.
Therefore it is tbe Democratic tariff sys
tem and not loose management, the
superintendent claims, which causes the
results of tbe convict mill to fall below
the Governor's expectations. Rutherford
was for seventeen years in tbe Planet
mills of Brooklyn, N. V., then one of the
largest mills in the East, and has an inter
est in cotton-mills out here. He says con
vict labor is not cheap, for the men do not
do one-third the work of a free man. Be
sides, of tbe few convicts tbat he could
call "skilled" the greater number have
been drafted to work on the Tiburon road.
He has no fear of his bead being
"lopped off," for he took the position for
only a year, and his term will expire next
month. He says since the mill was run
ning it has forced the price of grain bags
to the farmer from 8 and 9 cents to 4 1-5,
while in the meantime jute has gone down
something over 1 cent. With tbe tariff,
be saya, the null is all right. Without
the tariff even a convict mill will not pay.

FEDERAL OFFICER
ACCUSED OF FRAUD
Commissioner of Deeds
Dickson Charged Ex
orbitant Fees.
It Is Alleged That He Used
His Office for Illegal
Purposes.
DEVINE UNDEB INVISTIGATION
The Ex-Cu.3t.oms Inspector Is Said to
Have Extorted Money From
Chines?.
The United States Grand Jury consumed
nearly two hours yesterday in investigat
ing serious charges that have been made
against Captain A. F. Dickson, United
States Commissioner of Deeds for Sierra
County. '
It is alleged that Dickson, under cover
of his office, has been charging and secur
ing larger fees than the law provides. The
sharp practice, it is claimed, has been go
iDg on for some time, though just the
amount thus illegally obtained by the
Commissioner has not yet been deter
mined. It is said, however, to run well
into the hundreds.
Seven witnesses from Plumas, Lassen
and Sierra counties were examined yester
day, and they all told a wonderfully con
sistent story of Dick'son's shortcomings.
The principal witness against the accused
official is William Peck, Registrar of
Lands, with headquarters at Susanville.
He said yesterday that he bad abundant
evidence to prove the peculiar methods
practiced by the Commissioner of Deeds.
Captain Dickson is one of the most
prominent citizens of Sierra County. Six
years ago he was appointed by Judge Me-
Kenna to the position of Commissioner of
Deeds, which position it is now claimed
he has misused.
The Grand Jury also considered seri
ous charges against ex-Customs In
spector Gus Divine. It is alleged that
in the month of April last Divine repre
sented to one Quong Ah Him, who then
resided in Auburn, Placer County, that
he was still in the service and vested with
all the powers which generally go with
an Inspector of Customs.
It is said that Divine exercised this sup
posed authority to the extent of seizing
ten tins of unstamped opium found in
Quong Ah Him's place. The ex-In
spector then offered, it is claimed, to re
turn the opium on payment of $30, which
sum he is said to have received. Other
instances similar to the one already re
lated will, it is said, be presented to the
Grand Jury for consideration. Yesterday
a number of subpenas were issued for sev
eral witnesses wbo are expected to testify
against Divine. Wong Sam, who figured
so prominently in the Williams case, will
probably bo an important witness for the
Government.
Judge Fulweiler of Auburn was among
the witnesses examined. The Grand Jury
postponed action in this as well as in the
Dickson case, though it is generally be-
Jieved that indictments will be returned
against both.
LET THE JURORS GO,
Judge Daingerfield Discharges
the Panel Tlufe Tried the
Quill Case.
Their Time Had Expired and He
Entertains No Charges of
Malfeasance.
The entire panel of jurors that has been
serving in civil cases in Judge Dainger
neld's court was on Monday dismissed.
His Honor, in excusing them, remarked
tbat the charges in the Quill case had
nothing to do with his action, but that
their time was up a week ago.
Judge Daingerlield said, in part:
"I desire to make a statement to such
jurors as are present in the courtroom re
lating to the expiration of their term of
service. You are doubtless aware, gentle
men, that there have been certain un
pleasant things said and dove in regard to
your panel, end it happens, by an unfor
tunate coincidence, that we had in con
templation the discharge of the panel be
cause of tbe ordinary service of time, Just
at this juncture we were waiting for a
court day, or for elbow-room in the calen
dar whereby we could give the Sheriff time
to summon a new venire.
"In taking leave of you, gentlemen,
there is grave danger, unless I make these
remarks, tbat the community may have a
false impression tbat I am discharging
you because of some dissatisfaction. J
desire to state here that such is not the
case. The fact that yon are discharged
and tbat your services have terminated in
due course, following so soon upon the
unpleasant developments of tbeiDast week
and of the week before vacation, might
make people think, unless I rebut the pre
sumption by these remarks, that I had
some prejudgment in the matter. I desire
to disclaim any opinion upon the unpleas
ant charges one way or the other, and in
terminating your services I desire to
express my pleasure and satisfaction at
the general tenor of your verdicts and at
the mode in which you have discharged
your duties."
CHER BABE A SKELETON.
Mrs. Mary Fleming Arrested With Her
Neglected Child of Three Months.
Mrs. Mary Fleming was arrested yester
day at 864>i Mission street by Officer Hol
brook of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. Mrs. Fleming had
with her a three-months-old child when
she was arrested, a puny little thing, not
much more than skin and bones, wbo,
notwithstanding her age, hardly weighs
10 pounds. A few weeks ago Mr. and
Mrs. Fleming came into an inheritance of
about $800, and since that time they have
both been drinking and their little child
has been badly neglected. The neighbors
have complained.
When Officer Holbrook arrived at 864%
Mission street yesterday Mrs. Fleming
seemed to be on the edge of delirium
tremens. She was also suffering badly
and complained tbat her husband had
choked her and hurt her bacs. Mrs.
Fleming was taken to ther Central police
station and booked for cruelty to children.

Executors of the Miranda Lux Estate
Claim They Were Overcharged.
Another suit has been tiled in conse
auence of the alleged overcharge made by
the County Clerk for filing an inventory.
Yesterday the executors of the will of
Miranda Lux made complaint that $800
bad been charged for filing the inventory
of the estate, and they sued the City and
County for $770, which is the amount said
to have been paid in excess of what is le
gally due.
The $800 charged by Mr. Curry was de
manded under section 163 of the county
government act, approved March 24, 1893,
which act, the plaintiffs contend, does
not apply in their case, as the proceed
ings were begun before the act went into
effect.
Argument as to the fee in the Eisen es
tate was heard by Judge Coffey. The at
torney in that case also claims to have
been overchaged by the County Clerk.
The matter was not finished but will be
argued further.
The Error Was on liodpers.
Joseph Thomas, a painter, met J. Rodgers of
114 Devisadero street near his home Monday
night and knocked him down. Thomas broke
Rodgers' jaw and knocked three of his teeth
out. Yesterday morning Rodgers swore to a
complaint fn Judge Low's court charging
Thomas with battery, and Thomas was ar
rested and locked up in tbe City Prison. The
only explanation he would give of his conduct
was that it was a case of mistaken identity.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the 1
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of j
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,. j
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid ,
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso- :
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiah" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually. first appear on the Washington !
coast. When the pressure is high in the Interior j
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend j
â¢ north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coas'- warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK. MARKETS.

NEW YORK, N.Y., Oct. 13.â Higher quotations
from London, additional engagements of gold
abroad for shipment to New. York and the an
nouncement by senator Quay of the Rtpn hi lean
- National Committee regarding the outcome of the
Presidential election were the factors at work in
the local stock market. : Low rates lor sterling ex
chance and the strength of cotton, corn. wheat nna
provisions also had a stimulating influence. -The
weakness of the sterling exchange encouraged the
hope of a continuance of | the gold movement this
way, especially as the metal is still command
ing a commission in the local market of 5-ltS'a%
for spot celivery. Importers expected heavy arri
vals late in the week, some estimates putting the
total at 000,000.
The developments referred to - alarmed the
shorts and reactionists, and the purchases for
their class stimulated the upward movement.
1 Commission-bouse Du.Mness, as of late, was light,
and london did little or nothing. Tobacco recorded
the greatest gain, selling up from 691/2 to '71J,4.
The rise was again attributed to manipulation.
Rumors of an early settlement of the war with the
company's competitors were again revived.
Sugar and Manhattan were inclined to lag at inter
vals, but In the late trading these stocks moved
up with the general list. Sugar was advanced to
107 V 4, reacted to 106% and then rose to 107 .

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ilx., Oct. 13. â Holders of wheat
found themselves IV2C per bushel better off this
morning than they were at the close yesterday,
and the unfortunate shorts were correspondingly
poorer. Why this was so was, explained by the
prominence given to the purchases of wheat yes
terday at San Francisco for shipment to < alcutta,
Ind'a. The demand for that country as well as for
Australia has become the absorbing 'actor in fix
ing prices recently. News from the latter Is very
gloomy as to crop prospects, and under the circum
stances wheat finds warrant for advancing in
value. Liverpool cables this morning were up Id,
while yesterday we gained but a mere fraction. *
Ihe movement in the Northwest continues
heavy, 1433 cars arriving to-day, against 1289 last
Tuesday and 1446 last year. Chicago received 261
cars and inspected* out 18,168 bushels. Closing
Paris and Antwerp cables were higher and Berlin
lower. Exports were moderate at 277.635 bushels.
Bradstreet's report an increase in the world's visi
ble supply of 6,307,000 bushels. R December
opened at from 7014 cto 70s/gC, sold between 7014
@70"/ B e, closing at 70%@70%c, B @U,4c higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row 370 cars.
CORN â Was less active than wheat at the open
ing, stimulated by the strength of Liverpool cables
(an advance of Id being quoted there), and by the
buoyancy of wheat prices started at a material
gain over yesterday's close. The - charters at this
place, and the demand from â¢ abroad, tend to
encourage traders. Receipts to-day were 840 cars,
485 less than expected, and 791,452 bushels were
taken from store. Export clearances were 203,
--479 bushels Bradsireet's gave an increase in
stocks of 912.000 Dushels. May corn opened from
tSVic. to ". B%c, advanced to 28% c. closing at
-B Vic, %c higher than yesterday, estimated re
ceipts tor to-morrow 865 car*
O.VI Sâ The booming propensity of wheat anl
corn was not without its effect on oats, which ad
vanced through a natural emulative Impulse.
Receipts were 88 cars, and 99,025 .bushels were
w thdrawn from store. Exports were 29.857
bushels. â¢ Bradstreet's reported an increase in
stocks of 944.000 bushels. May oats closed 8 c
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for .0
morrow 330 cars.

PROVISIONSâ The bull fever was on in pro
visions as well as in grain. Hogs were again*
higher, and that with the soaring inclination of
the grain markets afforded ti:e necessary motive
for belter things in products. Late in the session
a realizing movement set in ' and everything re
ceded. January pork and lard closed 5c lower,
and January ribs 2%c lower.

How Ruseian Convict* Are Treated.
That is a grewsome picture which the
Odessa correspondent of the London Daily
News draws in describing a shipload of
nearly a thousand convicts about to sail
for Snghalien. Some 300 of the criminals
are murderers, and "all are fettered with
wrist, waist and ankle chains, and in some
instances the iron anklets are weighted
with heavy shots." As regards accommo
dation and treatment on board, the cor
respondent says: "There are rows of iron
cages such as are found in a menagerie,
with ringbolts, etc. A steam-pipe runs
along the front of these human dens,
having a number of turncocks and metal
sheathed hose with handy nozzles. The
special purpose of this provision is, in
case of violent insubordination, to parboil
the prisoners into submission with steam
jets."

SILVEEITES SEEK SECRECY
Their President Fears That Ten
Dollars a Head Might Buy
Thtm
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
906 Broadway, Oct. 13. - )
The Army and Navy Republican League
are hichly indignant at the charges of dis
loyalty that have been circulated regard
ing them by J. W. Dutton. The veterans
are discussing the matter daily at their
headquarters and are of the opinion that
PRESIDENT J. P. McELROY of the Army and Navy Republican
League, and )Â» WÂ» Dutton of the Bryan Army and Navy
League* The Dimensions of the Pictures Represents the
Relative Strength of the Organizations.
they should at once enter a pronounced
denial.
J. W. Dutton is known as "the poet of
the sheriff ' 3 office," and some of his ac
quaintances say that there is a marked
similarity between bis meter and his pub
lished statement â both need some correc
tion.
Mr. Dutton was also a very pronounced
anti-Democrat before the Democratic tiger
swallowed i's famous meal at St. Louis,
but now be speaks about crucifixions on
crosses of poll.
The particular statement to which ex
ception is taken is the following: "For
the past few years, however, many of the
veterans have been deserting its ranks
antt since the Republican convention at
St. Louis declared in effect that this is no
longer an independent Nation the deser
tions by the veterans from the Republican
ranks have been rapidly increasing."
The Army and Navy League declares
that tbe p ain intent of the words is to
create the impression thai a very consid
erable portion of the old soldiers are
deserting the Rei.ublican party. A few
days ago Mr. Duttor., who is Dresident of
a "silver league" of his own, was asked to
furnish a list of the members, but declined
to do so on ;he ground that it tbe names
were printed efforts would be made to buy
them over for $10 a head to vote tbe Re
publican ticket. This has brought down
upon him the wrath of the half-hundred
members he claims for his league.
The Army and Navy Repub.ican League
has published its full list and it contains
the names of 550 genuine veterans, and
President J. Â¥. McElroy says tbe list is
growing aaily.
There is only one Arnjv and Navy
League," said President McElroy to-day,
"and that is a eenuine Republican organi
sation. Not one-tenth of the vet rans are
to be found outside tbe Repub.ican ranks,
and what is true of Oakland in true of the
whole coast. Major Woodward recently
went to Sacramento to organize an Army
and Navy League, and the veterans there
are almost unanimous."
Mr. Dutton said to-night: "I did say
that one of the reasons why I refused to
give the roster for publication was that I
did not desire, without their consent, to
subject tne members to temptation, in
timidation, bnberv or loss of position."

phylloxera pest is playing havoc with the
vines in those districts.
Regardine tbe crops, Mr. Hayne said:
"I should estimate that the ge: f^il de
crease in the product of wine and raisin
grapes this year is 25 per cent less than
that of last year. Last year's crop was
much r smaller than the crop of the. rear
previous. In a certain valley in the State
the wine output last year exceeded
7.000,000 gallons, while this year the total
product of the same valley will not be
more than 1.5J0.000. The prices in general
have risen about 35 per cent , over last
year. In some places- the growers are
getting - even 100 per cent higher prices
than they received last season.
"During my <:b-:ence I concluded a most
successful experiment with a quantity of
pure, imported wine yeast, and also with
a refrigerator for controlling temperature
during fermentation. The rents of these
experiments will be given to the public
very shortly."

THE EDITOR PENITENT.
Gavin Dhu High Will Present
Himself at the Jail This
Morning.
Judge Wcod Will Probably Pass Only
a Nominal Sent nee on the
Second Charge.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 13.â When Gavin
Dhu Hieh, the editor, was called in the
Police Court this morning to be sentenced
on a second charge of criminal libel on W.
J. D ngee his attorney. Emit Nusbaumer,
addressed the court and said:
"The defendant now stands convicted
on two charges of criminal libel, on the
first of which be has already been sen
tenced to serve five days in the City
Prison and pay a fine of $250. In the sec
end case the matter rests on a motion for
a new trial. The defendant is willing io
Â»Â»>ide by thf semence imposed by this
court for the first offense and dismiss the
appeal which is now pending in the Supe
rior Court.
"The defendant is willing to throw him
pelf unon tbe mercy of he court, and
hopes the court will deal with bini
leniently in this second case. He is will
ing to make a retraction of the publica
tion? for which he has been prosecuted,
and in the light of this believes that the
court should deal leniently with him. I
tbink that tbe sentence imposed by the
court in the first ense is commensurate
witn the off>nsÂ«. T^iis case is not one in
which the peneral public is interested, but
rather Mr. Dingee personally."
He requested a continuance until to
morrow, that the appeal might be dis
missed, and said tbe defen lant would be
present in the morimu' to begin io serve
ns sentence. Judge Wood *aid that if
such was tbe case, it began io look as if
he was realty penitent, but he did not
agree with t c attorney regarding the
statement that the public was not inter
ested. Continuing he saiit:
"I may say I had fully made up my
mind to give the defendant a much more
severe sentence in this case than I imposed
in ihe other. However, if ihe defendant
i* willing io retract his statements and
will abide by the decision rendered in the
first case I beii^ve I can exercise leniency
on the second charge. As to passing
sentence, that will becmunuei unti. thr
defendant has served that imposed in the
first case."
A novel form of duel is reported from

Much Greater Than

Mrs. Prescott.
A LIFETIME IXPERIEKCE.
Christian Endeavor ts Go a-S urn
ming to Gather Data lor Re
port on a Home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9uÃ Broadway, Oct. 13. * J
The mail brought an interesting batch
of letters to the offic of the Children's
Society to-day, and Mrs. Prescott, the sec
retary, will have a difficult task to satisfy
all her correspondents. Her office in the
Central Bank building is one of the most
interesting rooms in Oakland, and during
tbe cast six mon.hs more has happened
therein than the public has any idea of.
The strange fact was developed to-day
that there are more applications for waifs
and orphans from responsible people than
can be filled. Orders for two came this
morning, and one lady from a distant
State said that she would be here by tbe
end of November and would like to take
"a little bine-eyed two-year-old boy"
home when she returned.
"It is a remarkable fact that there are
more comfortable homes awaiting aban
doned children than there are waifs," said
Mrs.Prescott to-day. "It is not unusual for
people to write to me as soon a* they see
in the papers that I have applied for the
guardianship of a child. There are sev
eral societies that are organized for homp
lindinj- purposes, but there is no real ne
cessity for them, as the societies for the
prevention of cruelty to children, with
their experienced officers, are the best
mediums by which to attend to a forsaken
little one's welfare."
Rarely does the dignified Judge Greene
bestow such compliments from the bench
as he t aid to Mrs. Prescott yester.lay,
when the guardianship of Anna Furtado
was on trial. His Honor said that Ala
medu County was truly fortunate in hav
ing such a woman engaged in Â«uch work.
He referred to the many cases that had
come befure him, and expressed a wish
that some of the true womanhood of Mrs.
Prescott could be found in the parents of
the little ones whose cause she cham
pioned.
Mrs. Preacott's experience with children
began when she was in her teens. At that
time she taught in the St. Louis public
schools. A few years ago she was the
public librarian at Los Angeles. Several
little remembrances ornament her office
that bear witness to the gratitude ol both
parents and children.
The Christian Endeavor committee is
doing some slumming this week, so as to
gai her data to present at the next meeting,
when the matter of a children's home will
be discussed.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 13.â The police

One of the detectives said to-day : "I
am satisfied that it is an inside case. I
tried the door and found my knife would
not go into the crack, and I am positive
that it is smaller than any jimmy. ; Be-.
sides, the â  prints on ; the door were never
made by a ' jimmy being forced â  into it.
My opinion is , that the ; marks were made

be removed to other localities.

RACERS FROM THE EAST
Buckwa and Scarfpin of Ed
Purser's String Recent
Equine Arrivals.
Atkins & Lottridge Get in From
Windsor With a Big String.
Notes of the Track.
As the time approaches for the opening
of the racing season stables of horses are
arriving almost daily from the other side
of the Rockies. At Ingleside Track, where
most of the rncers are quartered, the track
is alive with gallopers these mornings,
and surue of them are being sent along at
a merry clip.
On Monday a string of twelve, belonging
to Atkins & Lottridge, got in from Wind
sor, Ontario, the best known of the lot to
local turf-goers being the good El Rio Rey
colt Scarborough.
Beauchamp does the riding for the
stable, and is said to be a greatly im
proved lad in tbe saddle. With this lot
of horses also came five owned by the tall
Easiern plunger, Ed Purser, purchase" in
the East as additions to his Cambridge
stable, and including such good performers
as Buckwa, tScarfpin and Triumph. Scarf
pin proved himself one of tbe best money
earners among the two-year-old division
racing around the New York tracks, and
Buckwa should get many winning brack
ets before the winter is over. Jockey
Frank Coady arrived with the horses.
Owner and trainer Bam Hildreth has
his hands full at Ingleside with a big
string of fifteen that he is gradually get
ting up on edge. The make-up or the
stable is as lollows: St. Lee, Service,
Caesarian, Sister Mary, All Over, Cash
Day, Lucky Dog, William Pinkerton, Sil
verado, Cicero, Lincoln, Alvero, Fairlaith,
a three-year-old by Terra Cotta, and a
yearling brother to St. Lee that is looked
upon very sweetly by the stable. A
couple ot years ago Cash Day was
considered about the best handicap horse
in tne West, and if he stands up should
prove very bothersome in some of tbe
handicaps this fall. Tne rogue Lucky
Do.- is being schooled over the timb r,
and he may redeem himself for past mis
deeds on the flat. Ceesar an, Sister Mary,
Alvero and the Terra Cotta filly are the
property of \V. B. Sink.
E.iward Corrigan is expected to arrive
here to-day. Among the horses he left
behind at the close of last racing season
were Colonel Clay, Bedford, Senator Irby
and Ducat. The first named three are all
doin>: well at the jumping game, the Sen
ator taking to it like a duck io water.
W. 08. Macdonough has thirteen
youngsters at Ingleside being trained by
"Chappie" Connell.
Del Norte, the brown horse, and Gov
ernor Bud.l oi Mat Storn's string have
both bten schooled over the jumps.
The steeplechase fever must be preva
lent, for Bioad Billow, in the stable of C.
F. Sanders, was given a trial over the
fences, and steeplechase rider Cook pro
nounces him a "corker." Cook says there
will be more jumpers than flat horses this
winter, and lovers of the "rail ould sport"
are in high glee at the prospects.
Andy Blakely, who has had the leg up
on many a timber-topper, is training Min
nie Ccc, Mr. Reel, Julia O, Snowdown,
Colonel Weightman and Jane Andrew.
Snowdown has developed into a strapping
ble horse, and is a good jumper.
Louis Ezell, tbe parson-like St. Louis
turfman, with the carloud of horses tuat
arrived at liigleside track Sunday night,
now has a string of over twenty.

POMPADOUR JIM
IS 1 "QUITTER"
A Telegram From Margin
Julian Dispsls All
Doubt
Manager Groom Learns That
Corbett Has Not Signed
With Fitz.
SPORTING MEN DISGUSTED.
Gibbs, Groom, Graney, Jordan and
Carroll-All Speak of Corbett in
Withering Terms.
The mooted question as to why Corbett
has adopted the Fabian policy in his deal
ings with "Sailor" Sharkey was settled in
a manner convincing to every one last
night, when J. J. Groom of the National
Club received a telegram from Martin
Jnlian, Fitzsimmons' manager, which
reads as follows:
New Yokk, October 13, 1896.
J. J. Groom. Manager Rational Club, San Fran
citco, Cal. â¢ Can't give positive answer at pres
ent. Waiting for Corbett to sign articles. II
he refuses I will do business with you.
Martin Julian.
This telegram was in reply to one sent
by Groom, asking if a ten-round fight
could not be arranged, to taue place in
San Francisco, bjetween Fitzsimmons and
Sharkey. The National Club had tired of
Corbett's dilatory tactics, and therefore
looked to the Australian for a contest.
Thus Corbett's one and only excuse for
not meeting Sharkey has now been taken
a^-ay from him, namely: that, as he had
signed to meet Fitzsimmons, no one
would be interested in a match between
him and so comparatively unknown a
man as Sharkey.
That telegram was the Crookes tube
from which emanated the X-raj r that
pierced Corbett's verbal subterfuge and
showed the skeleton form of dishonest in
tentions behind. That the local sportine
fraternity believes Corbett a physical
wreck, with no intention of fiahting either
Fitz or Sharkey, may be gathered from the
following subjoined utterance^:
J. J. Groom â I have done with Corbett
and do not intend wasting any more
money on telegrams. He has no inten
tion of entering a ring with anybody.
Billy Jordan â What have I said all
along? That Corbett is a "quitter" of the
first water. Fitzsimmons or Sharkey.
either, for that matter, could knock the
head off him in no time. He knows it too.
Eddie Graneyâ That is exactly the same
trick Corbett played witn Cnoynski for
so long. I knew he was dodging and this
proves it. He will either have to sign
somebody now or go out of business.
J. D. Gibbs â Corbett's actions to me are
simply laughable. He must lie awake at
night in order to avoid havinp his excuses
take grisly shapes and frighten him in a
nightmare.
Jimmy Carroll â I guess I was one of the
last men to lose faith in Jim, but it is now
all Kone. For some time I have been im
perfectly convinced that he was trying to
avoid a match, and this leaves no doubt.
Nothing could make Corbett act so but the
knowledge that he is physically incapable
of fighting.

GOLD DUST IN
A RICKETY BARN
Exciting Experience of G.
Bettles, the Alaska
Trader.
Valuable Personal Property In
trusted to a Transfer
Company.
HIS SUSPICIONS AROUSED.
Detectives Detailed on the Case ani
the Property Recovered After
a Search.
G. C. Bettles, tne Alaska trader and pro
prietor of the Yukon Press, who arrived
here on Sunday by the steamer Bertha,
had an exciting experience yesterday.
Hs brought with him three sacks of gold
dust valued at $48,000, several trunks and
boxes containing valuable skins and a
mammoth's tooth which he prized very
highly.
One of the packages alone contained 100
Deaver skins worth |1000. There was also
a large variety of skins representing all
the fur-bearing animals of the whole
Yukon country.
They comprised the choicest pelts se
lected during a number of years in antici
pation of their owner's return to the
United States, and most of them were in
tended as presents for his fiiends. There
were polar bear skins and black fox skins
and skins of numerous other animals
peculiar to the frozen north.
Bettles registered at the Grand Hotel,
and Monday night a man called upon him
at the hotel representing that he belonged
to the Union Transfer Company. The
name of the company was on s badge on
his cap, The man solicited the privilege
of removing Bettles' effects from the
steamer, and Bettles gave him an order on
the Alaska Commercial Company for
them.
Yesterday mornine the man drove to
the steamer in an express wagon, pre
sented the order and got the three bags of
gold dust and the trunks and boxes. He
informed the purser that he was going to
store the things in the warehouse of the
company and Bettles could get them at
any time.
Somehow Bettles became suspicious and
he employed private detectives to find out
wnere his property had been taken. They
were unsuccessful and could find no trace
of the transfer company.
On receiving their report Bettles nnr
ried to police headquarters late yesterday
afternoon. He was laboring under con
siderable excitement and bis story caused
the greatest consternation. Detective
Harry Reynolds and Policeman Aiken
were detailed on the case, and they were
not long in locating the Union Transfer
Company, at 243 Steuart street, where
they have a barn.
The officers searched the barn and in
the hay loft they found the trunks ana
boxes. They continued tdeir search for
the three sacks of gold dust and found
them in the harness-room. Tne patiol
wagon was summoned and the trunks and
boxes and sacks of gold dust were sent to
the City Prison for safety.
A backman named Lyons, who signed
the receipt for the property and who oc
casionally drives a wagon for the Union
Transfer Company, was placed under ar
rest and taken to police headquarters. He
was held for several hours pending an in
vestigation and was then released from
custody, as no criminal intent on nis
part could be shown.
Bettles was notified of the recovery of
his property and he hastened to police
headquarters, where he was profuse in his
thanK*.
Bettles Is a trader in Circle City, on the
Yukon River, in Alaska. He owns three
trading posts, hundreds of miles apart,
and is owner of the Yukon Press, which
has the distinction of being the paper
published nearest the north pole.

fessor J. A. Wiles, president of Golden
Gate Union, wno said the occasion was
one for rejoicing. He announced that on
Friday there will be a meeting of the

Miss Grace Davis rendered a vocal solo,
after which Rev. William Rader briefly
told what the pastor expects lrom the

The Rev. R. E. Dille offered words of
congratulations to the pastor and read a

TODAY'S INTEEESTINQ MATCH.
There Will Ba Two Very Lively
Days at the Presidio Athletic
Grounds.
A reception committee composed of dele
gates from the various local cricket clubs
met the world-famous Australian team
last night on their arrival in Oakland. The
travelers, though a trifle fatigued with
their long journey, appeared in excellent
condition and seemed to appreciate the
hearty welcome accorded them.
Following is a full list of the great
wielders of bat and ball:
G. H. 8. Trott (captain), H. Trumble, G.
Giffen, S. E. Gregory, C. J. Eady, C. Hill,
A. E. Johns, H. Graham, J. J. Kelly, E.
Jones, R. McKibbin, fl. Donnan, F. A.
Iredale, J. Darling and H. Musgrove
(manager).
On arriving at the San Francisco slip
the party was escorted to the rooms of the
St. George Club, where the visitors were
entertained by Vice-President Brandon
and members of the club and of the
cricket association.
An appropriate speech of welcome was
delivered by the vice-president, which
was aptly responded to by Manager Mus
grove and Captain Trott.
Frank Lincoln, the famous monologist,
entertained the company with some of his
inimitable sketches, and was followed by
Charles B. Hill, Fred Myrtle and others;
after which the visitors retired to their
hotel to fit themselves for to-day's event.
The actual team will not be selected till
this morning. The fact that the match
will be played on a fast concrete wicket
will doubtless affect the selection of the
eleven, for the bowlers are numerous and
each comes off best on his peculiar wicket.
The chances are that Giffen and Jonesâ
the first a medium-paced the other a
decidedly fast bowlerâ will open. There
is not a poor batsman in the team, so
spectators may Jook for a grand batting
exhibition.
The game will commence at 11 o'clock
and will be continued, with an intermis
sion for lunch, till 5:30 p. m.
Visitors from all over the State have
arrived, and will people the grand stand
both to-day and to-morrow, so, weather
permitting, the event will be a gala one.
Will Promote Woman Suffrage.
A matinee performance will, through the
kindness of Mrs. : Ernestine Krellng, be given
at the Tivoli Opera-house on the 22a \ inst., for
the purpose of raising funds to promote the
cause of woman suffrage. : Volunteers from all
the City theaters will take part in the perform
ance. The sale of reserved seats will begin to
morrow. Many tickets have already been sold
through the individual exertions of earnest
workers in the woman suffrage movement. â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1896.
STRUCK BY THE
WHITE CAR
First Victim of the Street
Mail Service in
Tow.
The Postal Inspectors Seek a
Teamster for the Terrible
Example.
BARNIDINO GAMPOLI'S FLIGHT
An Italian Driver Is the First Mar
tyr to the Laws Governing
Street Mail Cars.
Barnidlno Gampoli, Italian teamster,
aged 35 years, is the first victim whose
neck has felt the wheels of the white Jug
gernaut car which Uncle Sam runs over
the streets of Ban Francisco daily.
His case is cow pending in the
United States District Court and
Â«>Â«>
'V 0
the incoming Grand Jury will have
to decide whether the defendant, as driver
of a coal wagon, purposely obstructed the
car or whether bis hesitation to move over
the track was a mere lapse of memory or
failure to hear the sound of the gong,
which several witnesses said was gonged
to be heard four blocks.
The case of Gampoli is of special inter
est to Inspectors Munro and Thrall and to
Superintendent Flint of the Railway Mail
Service, because it is the first of the kind
in Ban Francisco, and the department, un
der the advice of the District Attorney,
has determined to make an example of
Gampoli and hold him before the people
as a terrible example to^ evil-doers.
The offense occurred" on October 2, the
scene of the alleged crime being on Mis
sion street, between Third and Fourth, at
which time Tomaso Odero and Barnidino
Gampoli, the latter of whom drives for
Brizzalari & Son, coal dealers, were allow
ing their team to creep leisurely ud Mis
sion street, whereupon the mailcar
crowded upon them.
Motorman Mulvey rang his gong again
and again, but the coalcart remained in
the way, and the evidence showed that the
delay amounted in all to three minutes.
As many of the mails make close connec
tion at the ferries the wrath of the mail
clerks ana motorman was great. Clerk
Perez got out of his car and took the num
ber of the cart, which he at once reported
to the inspector, who referred the case to
the United Slates Attorney, who, after an
examination of the evidence, recom
mended prosecution.
The Government is not vindictive and
does not demand the blood of Gampoli,
for the officers will be satisfied with a fine
o; |20; but they say they must establish
a precedent that will teach teamsters that
they must not laugh or be heedless when
they hear the gongs ring forth their warn
ing notes on the United States mailcars.
The evidence in the case now pending
showed that t he blork wherein the stoppage
occurred is 800 feet long; that the deleiid
ant had 500 feet in which to turn aside
and that instaed he looked back and
laughed at the gripman, for all of which
the United Btates Grand Jury will have
ita first chance to indict a citizen for ob
structing the mails on a streetcar line.
THE AFRO-AMERICANS.
President Morton Has Nothing to Do
With the State Council.
An interesting meeting of the Afro-
American League was held in California
Hall last evening and a large part of the
attendance was ladies. Carroll Cook, E.
Sweeney, R. H. Webster (candidate for
Superintendent of Schools) and M. Gaville
spoke upon topics of the campaign. Mrs.
George E. Spencer, one of the champions
of woman's suffrage, delivered an elo
quent address upon the subject to which
she is devoting her life and energies. Mrs.
Addie L. Ballou also delivered a spirited
speech.
President T. B. Morton stated an organi
zation composed of three or four men call
ing themselves the Afro-American League
State Council has started out on lines of
which he does not approve. Ttiey ap
pointed a committee of three to write to
the members of the Republican State Cen
tral Commute* and announce that they
were "ready for business." Morton was
greatly, annoyed to find that his name was
on ; ; the > : communication f- to â¢ ." Ma ; Mo-
Laughlin. Morton states that he : has not
had anything to do with the Afro- American
League ; ! State 'j Council nor is he sin any

CARROLL RETIRES.
Ho Will Never Again Keferoe Another
Fight Because of Unjust
Criticism.
Jimmy Carroll intends never again to
referee another boxing contest, because
some newspaper critics wrote that Carroll
favored Billy Walker of Australia in the
decision in the bout between him and
Charley Turner of Stockton.
"I gave my decision," said Jimmy, "and
I gave it honestly. Turner had all the
best of that fight in the first eight rounds,
and then Walker turned the tables on him
and it looked as if he were going to put
tise colored boy out. No matter how far a
horse falls in the rear, if he comes in
ahead at tne finish he is declared the win
ner. On the same principle I gave my de
cision for a draw."
And so Jimmy Carroll, the veteran
ringsman, will never referee another fight
on account of the criticisms made on his
decision. Walker, it is said, feels ag
grieved that the battle was not decided in
his favor.

The Lincoln Republican Club of the Thirty

THEY FEAR IT IS SUICIDE
The Friends of William Mc-
Laughlin Are Searching
for Him.
Left His Home on Chenery Street on
the 3d Instant and Has Not
Been Seen Since
The friends and relatives of William
McLaughlin, a son of Johi L. McLaugh
lin, president of the Fairmount Improve
ment Club, are searching anxiously for
him, with the belief that they will find
his body in the Morgue ere long.
Young McLaughlin is 25 years of age
and up to the 3d inst. made his home with
his family at 235 Chenery street. On that
date he kissed his sister affectionately and
after giving her the larger portion of the
money in his pockets bade her good-by,
saying that she would never see him
again.
On the day previous he had cbided her
eently for purchasing a brown hat,
saying that it would have been better had
she bougut a black one, as sne would need
it soon.
Since the date mentioned he has not
been seen by any of his friends and they
believe that he has jumped overboard, as
be often expressed an intention of doing
away with himseli in that manner.
As his borne life was as pleasant as the
care of his parents and three sisters could
make it the only reason for his suicide, if
such is the case, is sickness. For several
months past he has suffered with heart
troubles, producing insomnia and ex
treme depression.
McLauphlin worked for his father, who
is a well-known contractor in the Mission,
and when in health was both steady and
industrious. When last seen he wore a
dark coat and vest and striped trousers.
He is 5 feet 6 inches tall and of medium
build.

that certain parties, without Â»ny authority what

DASHED TO DEATH
UPON A LAMP-POST
Young Asch Meets With a
Fatal Cycling Ac
cident
Loses Control of His Wheel
While Riding Down an
Incline.
TRAGEDY AT THE PRESIDIO.
The Injured Lad Was Removed to the
Army Hospital, Where He Died
in a Few Hoars.
Benjamin Asch, 13 years of age, son of
Isador Asch, dealer in cigars and tobacco,
101 Grant avenue, met a shocking death
while cycling in the Presidio reservation
yesterday afternoon.
The little fellow, accompanied by a
youthful companion, left his home, 608
Guerrero street, early in the morning for a
day's sport on his wheel. After riding
around the park for a while, they decided
to go to the Presidio and Fort Point. All
went well with the boys nnd they were
having an enjoyable outing until shortly
before the start for home was made.
They were wheeling along the road at
quite a rapid speed when, rounding a hill,
they encountered a steep grade. Benja
min Asch's companion seeing the danger,
sprang from his wheel and saved himself,
but the dead boy was unable to control his
machine.
It started on a wild race down the in
cline, its momentum increasing every
instant. Finally the youngster last com
plete control of the flying cycle, and it
clashed from the road into an iron lamp
post.
Wnen the wheel struck, young Asch was
thrown violently against the post and his
skull was badly fractured.
His companion hurried down the hill,
and finding the whpel smashed to pieces
and the apparently lifeless body lying in
a pool of blood, which was oozing from a
deep wound in the forehead, hurried to
the army post and notified a soldier. The
soldier in turn informed Dr. Frick and
Dr. Edie, post physicians, regarding the
accident, and the injured boy was re
moved to the hospital.
The physicians worked over him for
several hours without avail, and he died
at 4 o'clock without regaining conscious
ness.
Dr. Frick notified Isador Asch regarding
his son's death, and made arrangements
with Coroner Hawkins to have the body re
moved direct to an undertaking establish
ment. Owing to a misunderstanding,
however, no undertaker called at the Pre
sidio, and the body was removed to the
Morgue.
Dr. Morgan held an autopsy on the re
mains and found that death was due to
cerebral hemorrhage caused by the frac
ture of the temporal bones.
Friends of the deceased and bis parents
say that the lad was always a careful and
good wheelman, if he could be called a
wheelman at his tender ace, and are at a
loss to understand how he lost control of
his cycle and met his fatal injuries.
