LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept 21.â Six men
lost their lives in the attack upon the
Coronado and the Emmett mines early
this morning, five being of tne attacking
party and the sixth a city fireman, who
was shot down while in the discharge of
his duty, he dying to-day. The dead are
as follows:
Jee^t O'Keefe, foreman Hose 2, aged
24. shot througn the body.
Bert Meib, 30 years of age, face riddied
with buckshot.
James Bikbon. aged 40, eight buckshot
in the abdomen.
John Mahoxet, bullet in abdomen.
William Higgixs. bullet in abdomen.
Mike Dougherty, a striker, found iv the
Emmett mine ruins.
It is believed that a numDer, variously
estimated from six to fifteen, were
wounded in the attack upon the barricaded
mines, but they were quickly taken away
and secreted, even the physicians attend
ing them being careful to make no report
of their patients. Of the besieged men
no one was injured, except one who was
slightly wounded in the foot as he escaped
from the Coronado mine over the trestle,
where he was a target for a fiundred guns.
To-night the city of Leadville is quiet.
The saloons are ail closed, and the people
who are on the streets stand idly about,
talking discreetly low. The full moon
shines above Carbonate Hill, where from
one or two shafthouses the -steam jets
laziiy float into the clear air as the great
pumps continue their ceaseless effort to
beat down the floods in the great under
ground workings from 800 to 1200 feet be
low the surface.
The State militia, for the fourth time in
two years called out to stop rioting in
mining camps, is arriving to-night, and
they will do merely patrol duty, for there
is absolutely no evidence of rioting in the j
entire camp. The two militia companies
of Leadville, a large company from Crip
ple Creek and two companies from Pueblo
were on duty here before darkness came
on, one company patroling the powder
magazines, three at the Emmett mine
and tne others on duty at the armory, wno
will doubtless assist the Deputy Sheriffs
and Police Department in patroling the
camp. Tne First Regiment irom Denver,
with the Chaffee Light Artillery and a
troop of cavalry will reach Leadville be
fore midnigiit.
While no one can predict with certainty
the outcome of the night the miners and
mine operators who talk say there will be
no further trouble until the militia return
home.
"Tne men who did the worK last night
are a set of cowards,'' said a mine oper
ator this evening. "They will do nothing
save in a sneaking manner. They prefer
to overpower some helpless man by num
bers and brutally assault him. We
learned to-night that the miners had a
meeting to-day and three meu were de
tailed to shoot down Mr. R. B. Estey,
the manager of the Coronado, on sight.
They will never do it; they are too
cowardly. For weeks he has walked
through the streets to and from the mine,
and though they have railed at him they
never dared to touch him. His courage
has been wonderful throughout these
whole troubles.
"We can never hope for a settlement of j
this trouble until the Governor places tne j
camp under martial law, and thus over- i
rides the local authorities, courts. Sheriff |
and Mayor. The camp has been under a
reign of terror, and all officers of ttÂ»e law
have been intimidated. No punishment
can be imposed upon offenders, exc< pt
through a military court, and until this is
done we need not hope for peace."
The miners, on the other hand, deplore
the whole mat er, and seem disposed to
lay the blame upon outside ruffians, who
have flocked to the scene of the trouble.
The destruction of the Coronado has
finally aroused the law-abiding citizens to
take steps for a summitry treatment of
the trouble hereafter. This afternoon a
meeting was held in the opera-house, and
a document received 200 signatures, which
Is practically an agreement to stand to
gether to protect life and property. In
abort, it is a vigilance committee.
There is a rumor afloat that Ambura,
president of the Miners' Union, has left
the city and officers and citizens unite in
saving that many familiar faces have sud
denly disappeared.
That there was to have bepn trouble last
night was clearly understood by the mine
operators and many of the miners. The
report was that the Emmet mine, being
located farther out of the town limits than
the Coronado, was to be assaulted and tne
men there were warned to be watchful.
At the Coronado two officers were on duiy
and they were warned to be vigilant,
while within all preparations were made
for a warm reception of the strikers.
Until midnight no evidences of trouble
were apparent. The streets were deserted
and ail was quiet about the Coronado.
Midnight was evidently the time set by
the assailants to make an attempt to stop
the Coronado mine from working. The
residents near by were mysteriously
warned lo get out of harm's way. Bmali
groups of men ran up the street or lurked
in dark corners. It is said that a police
man's warning wuistie was heard just as
The San Francisco Call
the attack began. The first indication of
danger to the twenty men within was the
dropping of a dark object within the in
closure near the oil tank. There was a
moment of spluttering fire and then a ter
rific detonation. It was a weapon which
the miners know well how to use â a stick
of giant powder. Another stick followed
the first, then a third, and with these a
fusillade of small arms. Volley after vol
ley was poured into the inclosure from
two sides. The high outero uter fence and the
inner barricade, however, was evidently
designed wisely, for no one within was in
jured there. The giant powder soon ig
nited the woodwork, broke the pipe which
conveyed the crude oil from the reservoirs
to the battery of boilers, and, the oil ig
niting, great sheets of flame quickly illu
minated the scene.
There, amid a rain of bullets and giant
powder, with the immediate danger of the
exploding oil tank and steam boilers, the
twenty men fought as only men under
such conditions could fight. From within
the engine-bouse and from the high van
tage point at the top of the cribbing sur
rounding the shaft they blazed away at
the attacking party. For fully half an
hour the shooting continued, until 1:45
o'clock, when the flames of the engine
house spread so rapidly that the defend
ing party had to take refuge in a tunnel
under the cribbing, where they made a
last stand for defense, believing that their
assailants would enter the inclosure to
shoot them down. They were caught like
rats in a trap. It was certain death to re
main, for the fire would consume them,
even if they were not murdered by the
enemy.
There was only one alternative and they
took it. Some made a rush, leaping the
fence, others took the trestle across Or
ange street, running the gauntlet of a
galling fire to the dump, where they made
their escape. The explosion of giant
powder and the rattle of small arms
aroused the whole city, and the glare of
the flames brought the fire department
promptly to the scene. One line of hose
was laid and gallant Jerry O'Keefe, fore
man of Hose Company 2, Beized the nozzle.
He stood on the corner of Seventh and
Orange streets and the stream bad just
beeun to come when a bullet fired from
behind sent O'Keefe to the earth, bleeding
from a mortal wound. It was a shot 4
aimed by a dastard and cowardly hand to
assassinate a brave man in the discharge
of his duty.
Armed men were hidden in various
places about the Coronado shaft, and pre
vented the firemen from working. The
hosecart, with Fire Marshal E. V. Roder
and one other fireman, drove along Orange
street and when heneath the trestle started
to reel off the hose. They had got the
line almos: laid when three men leaped
from behind the house at the northeast
corner of the alley.
"Drop that hose," was the command,
and three revolvers, glittering in the red
glare of fire, were raised and leveled at
the marshal and bis men.
"I would stay, by G d, but Ido not
want to be shot down in cold blood," said
one of the firemen as he dropped the hose,
and all three were compelled to retire to
the corner of the cribbing on the west side
of the alley.
The immense fuel-oil tank was now a
mass of flames. Great black clouds of
smoke rolled heavenward, illuminated by
the dark-red flames whicu shot upward
for . 10 Â° feet - Already the houses in the
vicinity were beginning to crackle and
blaze. At this moment an armed force
appeared on the scene. From the direc
tion of Harrison avenue rushed the citi
zens of the town. There were business
men, merchants, bankers, lawyers and
others, each armed with a Winchester,
ready to protect life and property.
Then commenced the battle with the
flames. There were plenty of willing
hanos to move the hose and the depart
ment could work without hindrance. The
attacking party disappeared. But while
the Coronado was the scene of great ex
citement the thirty men at the Emraett
were not forgetting their danger.
About 2:30 o'ciocK the sound of mus
ketry was beard in the direction of the
Emmett mine, and soon the thunder of
discharging giant powder followed. The
fuht made by the defenders was so terrific
that the assailants soon were glad to re
tire. The only damage done at the Em
mett was the destruction of a small fence
inclosing the property.
That several were wounded is certain,
and after dark to-night the dead body of
Mike Dougherty was found near by and
taken to the undertaker's. This makes a
deathroll oi five of the attacking party.
The Coronado shaft is the only evi
dence of the terrific stiugide made just be
fore dawn. The immense boilers, steam
engines, ians and powerful hoist are a
maBS of tangled ruins, pipes and twisted
iron lying over the massive machinery in
apalliug confusion. The tall gallows
frame and the temporary barricade about
the top of the high cribbing are practically
intact.
The Coronado property is bnt seven
blocks from Harrison avenue and is sur
rounded by small residences. Three of
these were totally destroyed, causing a
loss of $3000. The firemen and citizens
worked until the sun rose over Breeze
Hill before the flames were stayed.
The band of dynamiters had not over
looked the Maid of Erin. It was doomed
to destruction, but tne presence of mind of
Bam McCummings saved it. During the
fight of the early morning some one set
the shafthouse afire. Bam discovered it
and extinguished the flames before any
serious damage was done. An investiga
tion showed that there was sufficient giant
powder beneath the floor to have blown
the building to atoms.
AWAITING THE MILITIA.
rears That the "trikrrs May Tear Vp
the Railroad Tracks.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept. 22.â
Some uneasiness exists over the
delay of the special train from Denver with
the militia and artillery. The train was
reported at Granite, eighteen miles below
two hours aeo. One of the citizens under
arms reports that he has seen a number of
men on horsebacK riding swiftly out of
town, toward Malta and the river road.
An attempt to tear up the tracks below
Malta may have been made by the miners.
Between Malta anu Leadville the track
has been patrolled. The families living
near the Penrose received warnings to
day to move away, but aa that mine is I

strongly guarded to-night by members of
the citizens' committee no danger of an
attack there is feared.
At 1 o'clock this morning it was
reported that a plot of the strik
ers to seize the city's powder
magazine has been unearthed. It
created considerable excitement. There
is enough dynamite in the various mag
azines of the different mines to blow up
a dozen towns. There are rumors that an
attempt will be made to blow up the Maid
of Erin.
Alarm over tbe non-arrival of the second
train is growing, the troops here not be
ing sufficient in the event of another out
break.
Tbe business men to-night organised a
committee of safety to preserve peace at
all hazards until the arrival of the troops'
train from the plain.
Judging from the number of calls re
ceived by physicians in the eastern part of
the city there were at least 100 people
wounded in the light at the Coronado
mine.
MALTA, Colo., Sept. 22. 2a. m.â After
a very cautious run from tialida tne first
section of the train, containing the Gov
ernor's guards, reached this station (six
miles from Leadville) at 1:30 a. m., and
are being held for the last section to come
up. As soon as the last section,
which contains tbe cavairy, reaches
here, the two trains will proceed into the
camp piloted by an engine or else the cav
airy will be sent in advance in order to
prevent the miners from getting in their
work with dynamite. It is not likely any
of the troops will reach Leadville before
daybreak. .-:
BATTLE WITH INSURGENTS.
Arrival of Re-enforcements Saves a Small
Force of Spanish Soldiers From
Annihilation.
HAVANA, Cvba, Sept. 21.â While sev
enty-five volunteers belonging in Havana
and twelve regular troops were leaving
Caiabazar, near Havana, they were sur
rounded by a force of 500 rebels, com
manded by Castillo and Delgado, and
were attacked from all sides. The troops
defended themselves bravely, but they
would have been annihilated bad not as
sistance reached them. The sound of the fir
ing led to the dispatch of re-enforcements,
which succeeded in routing the insurgents.
The insurgent losses were place t hi the
official report at 100 killed and wounded.
Among the wounded are said to be Castillo
and De gado. The Spanish losses, accord
ing to the rjport, were thirty-one killed
and five wounded, but it is known that
the losses were much heavier than given
in the official figures.
Reports from different parts of the
island show that the rebels are still active,
despite the heavy rainfall. Insurgent
bands have burned the towns of San Fran
cisco and Colisito, near Manzanillo, prov
ince of Santiago de Cuba.

One of the Best of Her Class
and a Formidable Factor in

A HANDSOME PRESENTATION.
It Came From the Citizens of Indiana
to the Man-o:-W.ir That Bore
the State Name.*
. NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 2Lâ the bat
tle-ship Indiana was presented to-day with
a Handsome silver service by the citizens
of the State in whose honor the vessel is
named. ":'"'â '
- . The ceremonies of the presentation were
simple but impressive.
The handsome silver set was spread out
on the quarterdeck aft, and gathered
about it was a distinguished company of
naval and military men, a number of citi
zens of Indiana and beautiful and well
gowned women. Grouped about on the
turrets and the sides of the ship were
jack tars in their natty costumes, all
making a striking scene. One of the
features of the day was a speech by ex-
President Harrison.
Nearly all the official party, including
Governor Matthews of Indiana, ex-Presi
dent Harrison and Assistant Secretary of
the Navy ? McAdoo, boarded the dispatch
boat Dolphin at We*t Thirty- fourth street
early in the morning and steamed down
the bay. proceeded to the Indiana
by way of th.Â» ferry to Tompkinsviile.
The Dolphin came down to the hne-of
battle ship shortly before noon.
The awaiting squadron had been formed
in indented columns, and as the Dolphin
passed through, the flagship New York
gave a salute of seventeen guns. The
Dolphin acknowledged it with a response
of thirteen guns.
â  The Dolpnin proceeded out, giving the
guests a little excursion to sea. She re
turned shortly after 2 o'clock and trans
ferred her guests to the Indiana.
In the meantime, Admiral iiunce had
come aboard from the flagship and was
received by Captain Robiey D. Evans of
the Indiana. The first, party to come
aboard from the Dolphin was ex-President
Harrison, who was warmly greeted by
Admiral Bunce. The moment he stepped
on deck, the big guns of the whole; fleet,
the Raleigh, Massachusetts, Maine,* Mont
gomery, Columbia, New York and Indiana
thundered out twenty-one guns, the
Indiana's band played "Hail to the Chief,"
while the jacK tars stood at quarters and
saluted. \ .
The guests, some 200 in all, formed a cir
cle around the spot where the silver ser
vice was displayed. The ceremonies
opened w, th a presentation address by
Governor Matthews. who took his position
in front oi the beautiful . silver .'set, and
spoke eloquently,' incidentally touching on
the silver question.
. Governor Matthews was followed by As
sistant Secretary of the Navy McAdoo ; :
who accep.Â»d â  the service in behalf of his t
department i and of i Captain Evans of the
Indiana. :â > ;
â¢' Charles "R. Williams of : Indianapolis,
the prime in starting J the popular
fund for UJe service, was the next speaker,
and at the conclusion of his address there
were cries for ex-President Harrison, who
responded as follows:
"I am delighted to be here and witness this
magnificent spectacle. I am especially de
lighted because of the fact that I am a sort of
a grandfather to the Indiana and I confess tne
fact tbe more willingly because she is so
young a ship. When I was in a position to
have some influence with the Secretary of the
Navy I told him I wanted the best ship then
building to be named after Indiana and X
guess he followed my wish.
"A company of Indiana people have come
here to-day â all those who could get away â
but all Indianans are animated by the thought
of pride In the ship, love of the flag and the
confidence in the men tue J ndiana carries.
"This is a magnificent siJver present. Gov
ernor Matthews here takes pleasure In the
white metal, while we take pleasure in the
fact that so much gilver will never get into the
mlnU. He is for free silver, but as to Captain
X vans and the rest of us tbe question arises,
4 ls Indiana a free-silver State?*
"We have wrought wonders in the building
of our navy. When I was a Senator I recall
with much regret the partisan jealousy mani
fested in reconstructing and rebuilding the
navy. It mortified me then, and I rejoice now
that we have passed that state of affairs, and
that Congress does not pause now to consider
whether we have a Democratic or a Republi
can Secretary when naked to build additions
to our navy, for fear of building up the navy
yard for election of time.
"The progress made in oar navy has been
amazing. The countries of Europe had spent
millions of dollars upon their navies, while
we fell behind for twenty-five years after our
Civil War. Now we come in to reap all the
benefits of the blunders and outlay of those
countries. We have marched up to them, un
til now we stand abreast of the great naval
constructors of the world.
"Who says we shall not go beyond them?
True, England has more ships than we have,
but she needs every one of them to protect her
interests. She must look out for her numer
ous colonies and guard her various interests,
for some of the European nations are catching
up with her. But we do not need such a navy.
We are a commercial people and > ur commerce
is extending. Our people are scattering all
over the earth. We send missionaries to far
off lands. We must take care of them. We
must have ships to speak of our power at
home and if necessary let the commanders
clear decks to protect our citizens from outrage
abroad. Our foreign policy has not been a
sentimental one, but our sympathies have
gone out to every onesuflerlng for freedom. We
are not going to seize other people's countries.
We are not a Nation of filibusters; but other
countries are stretching out. The world is not
big enough for them. They have come to tbe
time like that which came to Alexander, when
the world was not large enough. There is a
hemisphere here in which we have an interest.
We have a watermelon, so to speaK, and when
It is to be sliced, we are not going to allow
anybody else to eat it all up.
Our peoplfrare holding congresses of arbi
tration. This is all very weil; but do you
notice ttiat demands for indemnity are never
made upon a country that has battleships like
â¦his? How these ships do enforce a diplo
matic notel We must get out into the seas
everywhere and look after our citizens. We
do not want to be treated like Africa has been.
Mr. Harrison then proposed three
cheers foT "the good ship, the officers and
m-n and the flag above her," and th
cheers were heartily given, linen Captain
Evans stepped forward, saying:
"My lads, three cheers for the men who
gave us this silver," and the Indiana re
sounded witn the lusty shouts of the gal
lant crew. The guests were then taken on
a tour of inspection over the ship, after
which they were transported to the Dol
phin, which conveyed them Dick to New
York.
JOHN L. AGAIN IN TROUBLE.
The t.x-Chatnvion F metiers on a Street
car Conductor,
BOSTON. Mass., Sept. 21.â John L. Sul
livan spent a few hours in a station-house
to-night waiting for some one to come and
bail him out. The cause of the big puei
list's imprisonment was an assault upon
William Humphrey, a streetcar driver.
As the car came along Sulli
van stood on the sidewalk and
motioned for it to stop. As it slowed up
Sullivan stepped out, leading a big mastiff
along with him. The conductor toid him
that the dog could not get on the car, and
when Sullivan insisted the" conductor
pushed him off the footboard. This be
gan the row, and Sullivan gave tne con
ductor several blows before he could bo
stopped. He was arrested and remained
in the station-house until midnight before
he was released on bail.

BIG CHICAGO OPENING.
Seven Thousand People in the
Audience, Including Many
Veterans.
HOWAED AND SICKLES TALK.
The Distinguished Warriors Fill the
Vast Throng With the Great
est Enthusiasm.
CHICAGO, Ilu, Sept. 21.â 1n the in
spiring presence of more than 7000 men
and women, hundreds of the audience
being veterans of the Civil War, the party
of Grand Army orators who are to make a
month's tour of twelve States under the
auspices of tne Republican National Com
mittee hela their first meeting in the Au
ditorium to-night.
Tue Veteran Ijnion League of Chicago
had charge of the meeting. President
Francis A. Riddle introduced the speakers.
Half a thousand people were unable to
gain admission, and all the permissible
standing space was occupied. Nearly
everybody brought small American
flaes, which were waved when
ever there was applause or other
demonstration. The sentiment of the
great army was patriotic to the core and
the tenor of the addresses was largely
military, interspersed witn jokes, miscel
laneous anecdotes and war stories.
There was an overture from a military
band to begin wilh, then a bugle call and
the calling of the meeting to order. Be
tween the addresses campaign and other
songs were rendered by a quartet. Bishop
Samuel Fallows read a series of resolu
tions setting forth the reasons why the
veterans of the 60's were for McKinley
and gold and pledging the soldier vote to
him.
General Franz Siegel of New York is ill
and will not be able to start with the
party. General St. Clair Mulboiland of
New York was not present, although he is
to be one of the traveling party. One of
the vacancies was nl!ed by General O. O.
Howard of New York, who received
an enthusiastic welcome. General
Howard said the Bryan people had
indicated by their platform that they did
not want the courts to enforce the laws or
want the Government to suppress riot.
They would revise the courts and consti
tution and they wanted to destroy the
Senate. When these attacked the United
States, be said, let us defend it all to
gether, as aid the boys in blue.
When General Daniel Sickels was pre
sented in a eulogistic speech the vast
audience rose en masse and cheered, to
the accompaniment of wavinz flags and
patriotic music. Then three lusty cheers
were given for "the hero of Gettysburg."
General Sickels said he came to Chicago
in 1864 as a Democrat to advocate and
vote for the re-election of Lincoln as a
war measure.
He called on all soldiers to stand up,
and they stood to a man, while they re
peated the flag - waving and cheering
scene. He said he came out West to talk
to the soldiers because they knew him
and tie knew them. He jndged there must
be some beautiful fighting all along the
line.

LONDON, Eno., Sept 2Lâ The Times
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Sebastopol saying that the Russian Black
Sea fleet has been put onto a war footing
and that three battalions of infantry hava
been embarked. Part of the fleet is
cruising off Otchakoff , at the mouth of the
Dnieper River, forty miles from Odessa,
under orders that if its commander reÂ«
ceives a telegram from M. Nelidoff, the
Russian Embassador to Turkey, it must
join the remainder of the fleet, leaving
Sebastopol and going direct to the Bos

troops in South Russia are ready for
active service.
At a meeting held to-night in Shore*

Christians by the Turks a most important
announcement was made, which, it is be
lieved, puts an end to all conjecture re
garding the action tnat might bs
taken by the British Government
in the direction of putting an end
to the massacres by force or deposinc the
Sultan. The statement was made by John.
Lowles, member of the House of Com
mons for the Hagerstone division of Shore
ditch. He said if England hid a free hand
in the matter, very few days would elapse
before there would be a change iv Turkey.
He then added that he was authorized by
the Foreign Office to say that Great
Britain was confronted by an agreement
between the three powers that it she at
tacked Turkey on any excuse or pretext
she would have to face that combination.
If she fired a single snot or took action
alone it would mean that at that moment
there would be a European war.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Sept.
21. â The Porte has received an official re
port, stating that 600 persons were killed
in the recent disturbance at Eguin, in
the Diabekir district of Armenia. The
Kurds attacked the Armenian quarter of
the town, pillaged and burned houses and
killed as many inhabitants as they
could find. The report says it is feared
that massacres wifl soon take place in
other districts of Constantinople.
GOOD CAUSE FO R ANXIETY.
Exposed Position of the Foreigners at
Constantinople.
The feeling of anxiety in Constanti
nople on the part of the American and
European residents, especially the Eng
lish, is very intense and naturally so. No
one can tell what a day may bring forth.
Any untoward movement on the part of
any of the Christian element, or indeed
the veriest accident, may start the train
that will lead to direst consequences. Sur-
rounded as they are on all sides by
fanatical and bloodthirsty Mahomniedans,
who, once in the way of slaughter and
rapine, take little concern as tc national
ity, the situation is a most critical one for
others besides the Armenians, and it is
cruelly aggravated by the procrastination
and delay, which is little short of criminal
neglect, on the part of those who are able
and who are morally bound to put an end
to constantly recurring acts of maladmin
istration, not to say systematic aod pre
meditated outrage and murder.
There is an entire absence of confidence
in either the ability or the intention of
the police and soldiers to preserve order
or to act with anything like impartiality
in quelling any disturbance that may
arise between the Turks and any of the
other inhabitants. Nothing prevents an
immediate and terrible outburst of the
present ill-concealed feeling of hatred to
ward all non-Islams but the presence at
the mouth of the Golden Horn of the few
small war vessels kept there by Great
Britain and other European powers.
These ior the time have sufficed to hold
the Turk in check and deter him from
making open and unprovoked assault, but
how much loncer they will serve to do so
Uan open question. The inaction on the
part of England and other powers after
Sir Philip Curries return to the PortÂ©
with his protest and the Queen's letter to
the Su tan, beyond sending a fleet into
ihÂ« vicinity of the Dardanelles, only
serves to make him more confident
of his immunity from punishment
and defiant of the warnings that have been
given to him. He is successfully in
trieuing and playing Russia and England
against each other, and apparently thinks
that neither of them dare approach the
mouth of the so>phorus wiih a fleet in
the face of the other. He feels certain,
too, of his ability to successfully defend
the water approaches to bis capital against
any available force either has, and this
feeling grows day by day as the British
fl<Â«et lies inactive in Kavala Bay. He is
fully convinced that the only reason that
keeps them from coming to Constantino
ple is their fear of the untested fortifica
tions and secret torpedo trains along the
Dardanelles.
The English residents are not the least
anxious of the lot, and thrir wonder in
creases hourly that Sir Culnie Seymour
and his mighty fleet do not put in their2
npi earancr. They fully appreciate their
situation, and recognize the in possibility
on tno part of the few v.ar ves^ls now in
rort of protecting and sheltering the Brit
ish subjects, to say nothing of Ujc Ameri
cans and others who have no refuge in
the shape of a man-of-war pre-ent.
Of the 700,000 or 800,000 people in the
cities and town* about the Goltfen Horn a
little over 50 per cent are Turk-"!, or rather
Mohammedan". Greeks and Armenians
come next in numbers, about 150,000 each,
and the balance is made up of Circassians
and other Asiatics â Jews, Albanians, Bul
garians, etc. Tiiere are comparatively few
Western Europeans and Americans am one
the number. All tlie^e, with lew excep
tions, reside in Fera and transact their
busine-s in Galata, and when occasion re
quires iv* Statnbonl. Formerly the Eu
ropeans all resided in Siamboul, but when
the several embassies, led by the- British,
one after another. ::iovcd across the water
and located permanently on the hills of
Pera the members of tiie various nation
alities followed them and have built up a
city as unique in character aud customs
as is to be found in the world. The archi
tecture is essentially European, but it is
like no other city in Europe.
With the exodus of the English and
others to Pera Stamboul was no longer
the center of the trade incident to their
presence. This gradually followed them
across the bridge to Galata, on the slope of
the hill crowned by Pera. In time the
two cities grew into one, as it were, and
now number together over 250, 000 people.
Pen is the residence part and scat of
diplomacy aud Galata the commercial
part. In Galata are the various shipping
houses, the Ottoman and other banking
institutions, most of the ioreicn con
sulates and hospitals, posteffices, etc.,
â with some churches and schools. The
business quarter, in which nearly all the
Europeans are engaged, lies mainly a few
LJocks on either side of the main street
leading right up from the outer bridge
past the tower of Galata and joins the
grand Rue de Pera at the brow of the hill.
A line ot streetcars starts from the Otto
man Bank aud runs up the hill through
Pera, on out to the suburbs. The short
est route down the hill from the principal
part of Pera, however, is throueh the
tunnel, several hundred yards long,
which begins some distance below the
iiussian Embassy and terminates just be-
Ju\v the Ottoman Bank.
Pera is, as it were, entirely surrounded
by Turks. On the northeast is Taksim,
east is Fundukli and Tapkhani, on the
west Cassimpacna, Husa-kini and others,
and on the south and through which the
only available routes to the landing
places lie is Galata, which, as far as the
residents are concerned, is as Turkish al
most as Sramboul itself.
In case of trouble passage through
Galata from Pera would be impossible for
unarmed men and women and children,
and sailors and marines from such war
vessels as are now present would find
much difficulty and serious delay in pass
ing up to Pera. The ground around the
various embassies are extensive and sur
rounded by strong walls, and the build
ings are substantial and large stone
structures. These would afford a tem
porary refuge in case of a sudden out
break.
Out the Rne de Pera, in Taksim and
near the Italian and German embassies, is
the ar'illery barracks, and iv care of any
other soldiers would be a guarantee of pro
tection to tne Perites, but being Turks
there is no counting on them or on their
officers.

BRYAN TALKED
IN DELAWARE,
He Was Sidetracked at
Newcastle and Made
a Speech.
FEW PEOPLE HEARD HIM
But All and Sundry Shcnk Him
by His "S^re and In-
flamed " Hands.
THE FIRST CHEER OF THE DA
It Was Given at Elkton, Where About
Fifty People Awaited the
Si'.ver Advocate.
WILMINGTON, Del., Sept. 21.âCandi
date Bryan slept to-niÂ«ht at the Ciayton
House, in this city, after a day of more or
less trying incidents.
On the trip from Dover to Wilmington
Mr. Bryan made a short speech to a large
audience at Newcastle, where a stop of
about a half hoar was made.
His car was sidetracked, leaving the
train to proceed to Wilmington. Later it
was picked ud by an excursion special
and reached Wilmington at 5:50 o'clock.
It was received at the railway station by
perhaps a thousand people, who cheered
the candidate heartily.
With his plans for a good rest in Wil
mington disarranged by the action of the
Delaware escort committee, Mr. Bryan
started out from Baltimore this morning
at 6:25 o'clock for Dover, Del., to fill an
engagement to speak in the afternoon.
The first incident of the day was at
Havre de Grace, where a tcore of people
boarded the day coach in which Mr. Bryan
was sitting and shook the candidate's sore
and inflamed hands.
At I'erryvilie, just across the Susque
hanna River, and at Northeast more peo
ple greeleu him in the oar. The first cheer
of the day was given at Elkton, reached
at 8:11, where about fifty were in the
crowd. At nearly every station somebody
explained to Mr. Bryan that his early
coming would disappoint many people
who were relying on adherence to the
schedule which the Delaware committee
had caused to be changed.
At Newark, Del., the candidate changed
cars to a little branch line that carried â 
him to Porters station, six miles away.
Some Delaware College boys of Newark
gave him an original Bryan yell, an! Mr.
Bryan went out on the platform and shook
hands with them.
When Mr. Bryan reached Porters he
found not the hundreds of excursionists
on whose account he had been persuaded
to lose his night's rest, but the members
of the Dover reception committee.
The journey from Porters to Dover was
made over the Delaware division of ttie
Pennsylvania Railroad. Middletown had
A ut a brass band and about 300 people, and
Mr. Bryan made his lirst little speech of
the day there.
Mr. Bryan reached Dover at 10:32 a. m.
A big crowd at the railway station gave
I him a cheer and then followed his car
riage through the streets to the Capital
Hotel, where a short informal reception
was held. When it was over Mr. Bryan
was spirited out a side door down to the
residence of General R. R. Kenney, where
he immediately went to bed.
Much refreshed by his nap, Mr. Bryan
went from General Kenney's to the Capi
tal Hotel, where he had dinner, and then
proceeded to the State Fair grounds,
where 5000 people, seated on the crand
stand and gathered on the track and en
closure, received him with cheers. The
candidate was introduced by ex-Congress
] mÂ«n John A. Nicholson at 2 o'clock.
Mr. Bryan said:
I want to read yon an extract from a speech
made on last Saturday by the Republican can
didate for President at Canton. Ho said:
j "Under the Republican protective policy we
i enjoyed for more than thirty years the most
I marvelous prosperity that has ever been given
! to any nation of the world. We not only had
I individual prosperity, but we had National
prosperity."
| Now, there is a statement made within a
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1896.
week by the Presidential candidate on the
Republican ticket, pointing back for, thirty
years from 1860 to 1890,*. and telling the
people : that during that period -we enjoyed
the most marvelous prosperity and .Na
tional prosperity. I want to show you
by this- same witness' very tentiinony
given six years ago, that after thirty years of
this kind of policy the farmers of this country
were not prosperous. If you will lake The re
port files with the McKinley bill on the 16th
of April, 1890, you will find the words which
I wish to quote: "That there Is widespread
depression in this industry ' to-day cannot be
doubted," speaking of agriculture. That is
what the Presidential candidate said when be
deliberately wrote the report and tiled it with
his proposed legislation. . â '
â That there is widespread depression in this
industry i to-day cannot bo doubted." :â â¢ [Ap
plause.] Again in that same report said:
'â¢One oi tne chief complaints now prevalent
among our farmers is that they can get no
price for crops at all commensurate . to the
labor and capital invested In their produc
tion." That is what he said, after thirty years,
of the kind of policy which the candidate of
the Republican party will bring you prosper
ity. Let me read again: '-We have not believed
that the people, already suffering trom lo#
prices, can or will be satisfied with legislation
which will result in lower prices. No country
ever suffered when prices were fairly remun
erative In every. field of labor." After thirty
years of that kind ot policy he tells
you that the j people are suffering from
low prices, and tnat no country ever suffered
when prices were fairly remunerative in every
field of labor. Now let me read you again
wnat he says in this same report: "This great
industry [speaking oi agriculture] is fore
most in magnitude and importance in our
country. Its success and prosperity are vital
to the Nation. No prosperity is possible to
other industries it agriculture languish." That
is what he said in 1890, that thorn was de
pression in agriculture after thirty years of his
tariff policy, and that without > prosperity in
agriculture there could be no .prosperity
among the other industries of the country.
Let me read you just one other ex
tract: "The - depression; in agriculture
is not confined to the United States. ; The re
ports of the Agricultural Department Indicate
that this distress is general, that Great Britain,'
France and Germany are suffering in a larger
degree than the farmers of the United States.",
There he is telling' us there is depression in
agriculture and giving the names of three
prominent agricultural, nations of the O.d
World and. telling us that the agricultural de
pression is even more marked over there than
it is here. 1 want you to remember that when
you read in the paper' that he said that lor
thirty years we haa such marvelous prosperity
in this country. [Applause.]
Now, my friend?, 1 nave quoted you that he
said there was depression In agriculture In
Germany. I want to read you wnat Prince
Bismarck Bays about the condition of affairs
in Germany. Our opponents are in the habit
of telling us that an the -civilized ! nations are
in favor of -the gold standard. The Germans
who live in this country point with a just
pride to the greatness of this illustrious Ger
man, Prince Bismarck. Let me read you what
he has mid within a few Weeks in regard to
bimetallism and then see whether he testifies
thai the gold standard htm been a good
thing for Germany. [Applause..] .In a letter
written to Governor Cuibertsun of Texas,
and dated the :Mth of August, 1890,
Prince Bismarcic" said: "Your esteemed
favor of July 1 has been duly received. I hare
always had a predilection for bimetallism, but
I would not wnile in office claim my view of
the matter to be infallibly true when ad
vanced against the views oi experts. I hold
to thin very hour that it would be advisable to
bring about between the nations chiefly en
gaged in the world's commerce a mutual
agreement in favor of the establishment of
bimetallism."
If the gold standard had been a blessing to
Germany why would not he say that it was
better to keep the gold standard instead of
getting rid of the gold standard and substi
tuting the double standard by national agree
ment?" J, ....-':.-'
Considered from a commercial and indus
trial standpoint the United States are freer by
far in their movements than any nation in
Europe, and bunco if the people of the United
States should find it compatible with ti.eir in
terests to take independent action in the di
rection of bimetallism I cannot but believe
that such action would exert a most salutary
influence upon the consummation of inter
national agreement and the coming into this
league of every European nation.
* We have those among us people who have
said that some other nation must take the
lead. Prince Aismarck says that the people of
the United States are freer by far in their
movements than the nations of Europe. Cuu
it be that this great German statesman has a
higher conception of the ability of the people
of the United Slates than the Tories, who are
not willing to do anything until they ask the
consent ot oilier nation*? [Applause.]
Not only does Prince Bismarck say that we
are freer to take action than other nations,
but ne says if we act it will exert a most salu
tary influence upon the consummation of in-
I ternational agreement aud the coming into
this league of every European nation. Prince
Bismarck testifies first, the gold standard Is
the policy in Germany and he wants bi
metallism restored; he testifies second, that
the United States is in the best position of all
the States to take the lead; he testifies third,
that if this Nation takes the lead it will have
a salutary influence, not -in preventing bi
metallism, but bringing other nations of
Europe into an ; international agreement. I
desire that you shall remember this testimony,
coming from to distinguished an authority in
Germany.
Let me call your attention to another thing
which Prince Bismarck said. Our opponent*
tell us that we are arraying one class against
another. . Let me show you what Priuce Bis
marck has said in regard to the classes on the
questions which concern agricultural depres
sion. A little more than & year ago he was
quoted as saving to a farmer audience in Ger
many mat the farmers must stand together
and protect themselves from . the drones of
society who produce nothing but laws. [Great
applause.] Sly friend*, divide society into two
classes. On the one. side put the non-pro
ducers and on the other side put the producers
of wealth and you will find that in this
country the majority of the laws are made
by the non-producers, instead of the producers,
of wealth,' and just so long as the non-pro
ducers make the laws, just so lone it will be
more profitable to be a non-producer of wealth.
Bismarck tried to arouse . the farmers of Ger
many to throw out these drones and - take
charge of legislation thernselve*. I suppose
they will call Bismarck aa agitator. [Laughter
nnd applause.] I suppose they will siy that
he ought not to array one class of society
ag :iinsi another. Of course, 1 don't know how
drones feel In a beehive, but if drones conld
ttilk and make speeches, I bet that you could
not tell one of their speeches from the speeches
made by the heads of thoÂ»e great tru.ts, who
cail everybody anarchists who do not believe
with them. ]
I will venture if a drone could tal_ and
write and express his ideas in language that
there is not a member of & syndicate that lias
been beating his Governmeu; but could take
the arone's speech and use itaÂ»bis own and
without being accused of plagiarism. [Great
applause.]
-My friends, that is the only class issue tnat
wo raise, and if to pay the people vrho fight
the Nation's battles in time of war have a
right to do the legislating in the time of peace
Is raising class against class then I am willing
to be called an agitator, my friends. [Great
applause and cheers.]
AN OFF DAY AT CANION.
But Reception, of Delegation* Wilt Be
Returned To- Day. /.-
CANTON, Ohio. Sept. 21.â This has been
an uneventful day for Major; McKinley.
There were no delegations scheduled for
to-day and none called. There were few
callers at the house and none of political
prominence. The candidate has stood the
strain of the ' past week with ' remarkable
firmness, and he is in the very best of
health and spirits. ;/ To-morrow afternoon
he will resume the reception of delegations
and begin another week of speech-making.
,The"delegations expected to-morrow are:
Citizens of Jamestown and Chautauqua
County, New York, sixteen coaches; Mc-
Kinley clubs of Northern Indiana, start
lin at E.khart and coming in a train of
three sections; Republicans and friends
from Holmes County, Ohio.
A few personal friends of Major Me-
Kinley have suggested to him the ad
visability of setting apart some portion of
each day at which time to receive visiting
delegations.; This arrangement; it is
argued, would bring the delegations to
gether and one speech could be made to
do service for two or more delegations. : It
would also give Major McKinley more
time to look after his private affairs. At
present the delegations arrive at all boors
of. the day and go at once to the McKinley
residence. '.*'â¢, SjESi
Although the proposed plan would re
lieve Major McKinley of a great deal of
the strain to which be has been subjected
the past week, it is believed he'will not
consent to any interference with the pres
ent arrangements. He has confidence in
bis ability to address all the delegations
that have thus far been arranged for and
he will be ' pleased to receive . them col
lectively or - individually â just as they
happen to come along.

BISMARCK'S LETTER.
Regarded by Democratic Leader* a* of
tireat Campaign Importance,
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 21.-The Demo
cratic National Committee regards the let*
ter of Prince Bismarck favoring bimetal
lism as a step toward an international
agreement, and the cablegram sent to Mr.
Bryan by the International Agricultural
Congress at Buda-Pesth is making the first
genuine political sensation of the cam
paign in favor of free silver coinage.
Members of the committee at Chicago
headquarters said to-day these documents
silenced the platform and assertions of
the Republicans on the point that the
United States alone could not change
the monetary system of the world and
that the present'agitation would be detri
mental to international bimetallism. The
committee decided to have ;hese declara
tions translated into several languages,
especially German, and distribute several
millions.
Governor Altgeld's Saturday speech in
reply to Cockran and Schurz is regarded
by Chairman Jones as one of the ablest
expositions of the silver cause that has
bt;en delivered during the campaign, and
the demand for it will be met by the print
ing of it in German and English for wide
distribution.

CHICAGO, v^ 111., _ept 21.â Senator
Shoup, the aggressive McKinley silver
Senator from Idaho, was at headquarters
to-day negotiating with Colonel Hahn for
Foraker or some other orator to make a
speech in Boise City. The Senator-elect
from Ohio is engaged to deliver three
addresses in Illinois, October 1 to 3, one of
which will be in Chicago and one in
Springfield. He will also speak in Burling
ton, lowa, October 8, on the occasion of
the semi-centennial celebration. of lowa's
admission.. Mr. Bryan will have his inn
inns there three; days after. As to the
situation in Idaho Senator Sboup said":
"The Populists and Democrats are
quarreling among themselves and accus
ing Â«ach other of bad faith. They do not
fuse with the bolting Republicans. We
| have a full Republican ticket in the field
1 from McKinley electors down to the
smallest office, and we will elect some of
the State ticket. The outlook for the suc
cess of the National ticket is promising.
We are thoroughly organized in every pre
citict, holding enthusiastic meetings and
gaining votes every day."

CHICAGO, III.; Sept. 21.â Urey Wood
son, National Coramilteeman for Ken
tacky, called at headquarters to-day. He
said:.
"If the election were held to-day Ken
tucky would : give * Bryan ; 40,000 majority.
Nothing can materially decrease that ad
vantage between now ana November. In
fact, I believe he will carry the State by
50.000 majority. There are not more than
5000 cold Democrats in the State and most
of them will vote for McKinley, while we
wiil get the whole PopSlist vote, which
amounts to 25,000. In Eaatern Kentucky
the Republicans are almost i a unit for
Bryan. General Buckner will get only
45 votes in his own county for Vice-Presi
dent. This is the result of an actual can
vass. The Democrats of Kentucky are
very* bitter against him. He introduced
and voted for a ; resolution in bis own
county convention -pledging the delegates
to support the nominees of the Chicago
Convention. His own violation of that
pledge is regarded by Kentuckians as a
gross breach of political honor.

A reporter called at- the residence of Mr.
Sewall this evening to interview him re

"I have seen the circular. sfou can say
that it was entirely unauthorized by me,
and I cannot sustain it. The American
Merchant Marine Protective Association

_ thorough observation of the party work
and prospects. To a reporter for the
United Associated Presses Mr. CuTimins
said:
"lowa is safe at this moment for 35,000
Republican majority. That is the best
judgment I can form. The vote will be a
little larger than we had last year. There
is one uncertain element there. We do
not know how many soond-monev Demo
crats will vote for WcKinlev. We will
have a lnrge gain from the Democrats â
more than we will lose from silver Re
publicans. Then there are the Democrats
who will vote for Palmer. There are
about 14,000 silver Republicans in lowa.
Organized labor is split up. I think the
railroadmen are with ns, although it is
said they are only talking that way and
will vote for Bryan.

from BadNauheim, in the Grand Duchy of

jority of cases has already been purchased,
and where it has not condemnatory pro
ceedings are being taken to secure it.
The entire plan for the defense of more
important cities has been completed and
approved by the department, but so careful
is it, not to permit outsiders to learn the
character or strength of the fortifications,
that it will not be until most of them are
nearly completed that the cities they are
designed to protect will know the actual
number of guns manned.
The allotment of 112,000,000 appropri
ated by the last Congress has been made
with the view to protecting larger and
more exposed cities from sea attack
and to set aside sufficient money for
smaller towns for the purchase of
land. It Is certain that ail the larger
fortifications will include in their
armament a number of 16-inch rifles,
by far the heaviest type of gun ever at
tempted in this country and of which
there are but few abroad. Recently the
War Department has purchased forglnes
to begin a trial gun of this caliber, and if
'it proves successful twenty will be manu
factured for the larger cities.
General Craighili, who will direct the
work of preparine the emplacements, re
fuses to discuss the question at all or to
intimate the nature of the defenses of any
city. Ho believes that all questions of
defenses should be guarded with rigid
care by the War Department in order to
prevent foreign Governments from secur
ing information, none of which would
think of permitting the United States to
acquire similar information as to foreign
defenses.
The construction of this great line of
defenses means substantial inciease in the
standing army in a few years, and es
pecially of the artillery branch, to which
will fall the work of manning and carine
for them. Nearly all tne fortifications are
at cities where the artillery branch
is either unrepresented or the gar
rison inadequate to the new de
mands, so that with the completion
of the defenses and the erection
of new barracks the army will be called
upon to famish at least two more regi
ments of artillery and possibly more, as
the work of protecting the country from
sea attack progres es. This means that
there will be a wide distribution of artillery
along the seaboard and new garrisons
established at points which have not
_nown the presence of Federal troops since
the war period.

DEFEATS SLAVIN
The Sponge Is Thrown Up
During the Fifth
Round.
SPORTS HEAVY LOSERS.
A Hot Battle at First, but the
Australian Was Out of
Condition.
HESULT OF A RECENT MISHAP
His S tigging Powers and Gam?ness
of No Avail Against Steve's
Cleverness.
MASPETH, L. 1., Sept. 21. â Steve
O'Donneli fought Frank Slavin to a
standstill in the fifth round at the Em
pire Athletic Club to-night, and the lat
ter: 8 seconds, seeing their man was all bat
out, threw up the sponge after the round
had been on one minute and thirty-five
seconds. Slavin fought badly all the way
through and the bell only saved him in
the fourth round. After the fight Slavin
addressed the crowd as they were filing
out. He said:
"I'm licked to-night, gentlemen; but I
think the man that has been behind
O'Donnell will give me another chance
when I am in better condition. I have
been hurt ever since Thursday and only
came here so as not to disappoint the
public and my backer."
As long as O'Donnell mixed it up
Slavin was the stronger at the short
range, but when Steve stood off it was all
up with Slavin.
About 1000 sports made the journey to
see the event, which was to have been a
twenty-round contest. The crowd had
scarcely been seated when a rumor was
started to the effect that Slavin had hurt
his arm, shoulder and back by a tall last
Thursday and that he was in no condition
to fight. It was stated that he had only
come over to make an appearance and had
done no work since the alleged accident.
The bettine was all in favor of Slavin and
the majority of the sports seemed to think
that the "accident" was a well-laid scheme
to induce the O'Donnell contingent to put
up their money. As good as 6to 4 could
be had against Steve's chances, as Slavin's
supporters calculated tnat his slugging
powers and gatneness wculd prove too
much for O'Donnell's cleverness.
FITZ RELEASED ON BAIL
Lanky Bob Must Answer the
Charge of Arranging a
Frize-Fight
Pompadour Jim Manages to Eu.de
the Officer With a Warrant
for His Arrest.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 21.â 80b
Fitzsimmons was arrested at Barthoidi
Hotel at 1:30 p. m. to-day by Detective
Senreant McNaught, who brought him to
police headquarters.
The arrest was made on a warrant
charging Fitzsimmons with misdemeanor
in arranging in this city for a prize-fight.
8o far as known Corbett, for whom the
detectives have a warrant, has not yet
been arrested.
Fitzsimmons was arraigned in the Gen
eral Sessions Court this morning before
Judge Fitzgerald. The courtroom was
crowded. Fitzsimmons leaned on the
railing in front of the Judge's desk and
looked straight at the Judge. He carried
a silk hat in bis hand and wore a Prince
Albert coat. His manager, Martin Julian,
stood beside him, but he had no counsel.
The indictment was read and Fiizsimmons
was asked if he wished to piead. After a
whispered conversation with Julian he
pleaded "not guilty." The Judge then
held him in $1000 bail, and as no bonds
man was ready the Judge added: "Com
mitted until bail is furnished."
Fitzsimmon* turned pale as the idea of
a prison cell struck him, but he was not
taken to a cell. He was talcen up to the
detectives' office in the General Sessions
building to await until some one couid be
found to go bail for him. Fitzsimmons
finally secured bail and was released.
The District Attorney said there were
two counts to the indictments. He furiher
said tnat the case of Fitzsimmons and
Corbett, who had been jointly indicted,
was the first arrest made since the law
was amended. The indictments against
the two pugilists were found by the Grand
Jury a week ago to-day.

SAN JOSE. Cal., Sept. 21.â The Santa

will hold a poultry show in this city from
November 18 to 21. It was originally in
tended to bold a dog show in connection
with the poultry exnibit, but owing to
the difficulty in holding them both at th
same time the kennel show has been post
poned. It will probably b6 held next Jan
uary or February. The committee in
charge of the poultry exfiibit is meeting
with much encouragement. Poultry fan
ciers from all over the State have ex
pressed their intention to make exhibits.
CROSS' WORK AT STANFORD.
Palo Alto Football Candidates Already
Show the Effect of His
Advice.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
21. â Coach Cross had the men out this
evening, and from the vim and spirit
which the players put into their work it is
pretty certain that his arrival has already
had its effect. The men go at the game
with moro dash, and, while t:ieir playing
is full of fumbles and is very ragged at
present, Cross says that before the game
on the 10th of October, with the same
amount of energy, he will have a winning
team in the field. Just now he is drilling
the men on quick starting and accuracy in
falling on the ball. For, as he says, "there
is lots of chance to save and to make
ground if all the players are speedy at
falling on a fumbled ball."
The linemen, too, are receiving a great
deal of attention, and it is evidently Cross'
idea to make the Stanford line so strong
that Berkeley will be unable to move it
down the field in the second half of the
game as she has done in some former
games.
Professor Angell, who takes great inter
est in the students' athletics here and has
identihed himself with their interests heie
as much as any other member of the fac
ulty, is convinced that Stanford'a chief
weakness in the past has been the over
training of the men. To this he attributes
the fact that Stanford always shows up
best in the first half of the game and
Berkeley in the second half. Cross is also
of this opinion from what Walter Camp
has told him and the descriptions he has
read of the contests. This he intends to
j avoid by giving the men less work than
I heretofore, but devoting more time to sig-
I nal work and developing the endurance of
the men Dy running and other like exer
cises.
Of the backs, Cross is well satisfied with
the material with which he has to work
and expects to develop some first-class
players from among the number of aspir
ants for Varsity honors.
Stanford ra. Berkeley.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., Sept,
21.â 1t has already been decided to hold
the intercollegiate freshman football con
test with Berkeley on November 14, twelve
days previous to the big game on Thanks
giving. Both events will come off at Cen
tral Park.
AN AWKWARD MISTAKE.
A Washington Official Is Twice Arrested
in Switzerland as a Criminal
From Montevideo.
BERNE, Switzerland, Sept. 21.â An
awkward mistake on the part of the Swiss
detectives has caused great annoyance to
George F. Curtiss of Washington, an as
sistant librarian of the American Con
gress.
When Mr. Curtis arrived at Grindelwald
he was pounced upon by detectives, who
mistook him for a criminal from Monte
video, for whom they were searching.
Mr. Curtiss was locked up despite his
energetic protests, but later the produc
tion of his passport and other documents
convinced the police that they had made
an error.
He was tnerefore released and profuse
apologies were made to him for the unfor
tunate mistake. Mr. Curtiss then pro
ceeded to Geneva, where the police made
the same mistake as to his identity and he
was again locked up.
It was impossible for him to convince
the authorities of Geneva that he was not
a criminal, and finally be was compelled
to telegraph to Hon. John L. Peak, the
American Minister at Berne, telling
him of bis predicament- Mr. Peck at
once laid the matter before the Govern
ment with the result that the release of
Mr. Curtiss was immediately ordered.
TINAN APPEALS FOR AID.

PARIS, France, Sept. 2Lâ The fact
that Patrick J. Tynan, the alleged
j dynamite conspirator, who was arrested
iat Boulogne-Sur-Mer, has applied to Mr.
: E ust is, the American Embassador to
| France, and to President Cleveland, de
| manding protection as an American citi
zen, was announced In the dispatches of
t:.e United Associated Presses on Tuesday
last, but at that time the contents of his
letter to Mr. Eustis were not known.
It is now learned that in his letter
Tynan informs him of the fact of his
arrival in the United States in
March, 1883, and bis naturalization
in 1888. He gives his place of
| residence in New York, enumerates the
members of his family and refers to Judge
! Fitzgerald, Recorder GofF and Judge
Roger A. Pryor as his friends.
He adds that be left New York with the
object of making a European tour, but
learning he was being shadowed by Eng
lish detectives he traveled under an as
sumed name. In the course of his travels
he went to Italy, Belgium and France.
It was his intention to return to New
York on September 20. Tynan pledges
his honor that he has not taken part in
any political affair in France, and that he
has done nothing beyond the ordinary
sight-seeing of a tourist.
PENSION BUREAU REPORT.
Over forty Thousand Names Added to
the Koll During the Year.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 21.âCom
missioner of Pensions Dominick Ignatius
Murphy has submitted to the Secretary of
the Interior his annual report on the
operations of the Pension Bureau for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, which
shows that 40,374 new pensioners were
added and 3823 restored who had
been previously dropped, making a
total of 44.247. The losses for
various reasons aggregate 44.093. The
whole number of pensioners on the rolls
June 30. 1896, was 970,678. The Corumis
| sioner states that it may now be
safely assumed that the roll from
the present time on will show a
steady diminution unless Congress should
enact still more liberal provisions. The
rate of mortality of the pensioners, par
ticularly those who served through the
War of the Rebellion, is rapidly increasing.

STOCKTON STILL

Now Catering to the Race-
Going Public of
the State.
FAST EVENTS DECIDED.
Some Good Horses Were Entered
and the Sport of Kings
Was Enjoyed.
ALL ABRANGEMENTS PERFECT.
The San Joaquin Valley Agricultural
Society Elated Over the
Great Success.
STOCKTON, Cal., Bept. 21.â The thirty
sixth annual race meet of the San Joaquin
Valley Agricultural Society opened with
an attendance that bids well for its suc
cess. The Sixth Regiment band of this
city contributed to the pleasures of the
day for the fair ones and their escorts in
the erand stand, ana Killip & Co. looked
to it that the betting fraternity gathered
in the ring was not neglected.
The day was cool and pleasant, and the
track, considered one of the best in the
State, was in fine condition. The arrange
ments for the comfort of the public were
perfect. The trotting was judged by Sen
ator Â£. F. Laugford and the president of
the society, F. D. Cobb. The timers were
C. L. Orton, W. H. Parker ana Charles
Owen. W. P. McNair, whose splendid
starting has given such general satisfac
tion throughout the circuit, dispatched
both the trotters ana runners in faultless
fashion.
The Australian starting-gate was a nov
elty in this part of the country and made
an instantaneous hit.
F. E. Mulnolland, a San Francisco turf
scribe, placed the first horses past the
wire in the running events.
The energetic and wide-awake officers of
the society, not to be caught napping at
the post, have concluded to keep a pace
with the metropolitan racetracks by set
ting Wednesday aside as "ladies' day,"
the fair sex passing through the gate with
out admission fee.
The horses of the fast clashes will not be
seen out here before Wednesday. To-day
was given up to a couple of running
dashes with moderate fields starting and
a district trot in which the hats were
badly chopped up before the final decision.
Gladiola, ridden by Little Woods, a prom
ising lightweight, who was picked up for
$1 in pools of twenty-three, took the open
ing six-furlong scramble. The favorite,
Grady, headed Miss Pollard out in tae
mile run, and General, who sold in the
field, captured the trot, to the unconfined
joy of his colored driver, Harrison.
The opening betting on this district trot
favored .Baby W, the bla< k daughter of
Wilkesdale, who brought $10, Schmale $6
and the field $5. Schmale, driven by his
owner, Professor Schmale, ana hooked to
an exercise cart, made his field look like
common cattle in the first heat by win
ning "off" from the favorite in 2:84^.
There was no change in the betting, for
the Baby was just as warm a choice as
ever for the next heat She took it from
Scbmale rather handily, and then there
was a lull in the pool-selling. In the thira
heat, though, a new factor sprung up,
General finishing in front of the favorite.
The field now sold a slight favorite over
Baby W. General's colored driver got the
Fallis â¢â hoss" home again first in the
fourth heat, "and dar was some genuine
consternashun in ac camp of the even
ing." General now brought $10 againsi $4
for the whole field. Rev. Green got up
behind Joe in the heat following and
through some picturesquely windine and
intricate piloting got that horse to the
judges ahead of General. But in the last
heat General outstayed Joe, taking the
heat and race. The time of this heat was
2:33%, the best of the race, showing the
winner to be a horse of stamina and game
ness.
In the closing pools sold on the six fur
long scramble, Jim Bozeman and Ricardo
sold equal favorites in the betting, each
bringing $10 with the field going for $6.
Irma made the running until well into
the stretch, when Gladiola assumed the
lead and won cleverly in I:l4 J^ with Re
bellion snatching the place from Irma in
the last jump.
Auctioning on the mile dash was lively
wiih the betting slightly favoring Grady,
the Three Cheers youngster bringing $10,
Miss Pollard $7 and the field $2. The out
sider Tuxedo with Shaw up scared the
crowd with coin oh the favorite by leading
to the stretch. Grady, who had been
pocketed, gradually worked to the front
and beat Miss Pollard out very handily in
1:42^. Young Cole, who rode the winner,
shows much improvement in the saddle;

NO TOLLROADS IN aHASTA.
Supervisors Declare Traveler a Over
Highway May Not Be Assessea,
REDDING, Cal., Sept. 21.â The matter
of the validity of the Camden Toliroad
Company's franchise came up for final
bearing before the Board of Supervisors of
this county to-day.
For a great number of years the Camden
toll road has been used for public travel.
It extends from a point just above Shasta
to the Tower House, a beautiful soot
owned by Charles Camden, the owner of
the road.
Tolls hove been collected by Camden.
It was claimed that some time ago the
company's franchise expired, and, failing
to apply for a renewal, the franchise was
invalid. Complaint was made and the
District Attorney instructed to bring pro
ceedings to investigate the matter.
Tha parties interested appeared before
the Supervisors to-day and the matter was
disposed of by the Supervisors authorizing
Camden to collect no more toll. Camden
claims he has a right to charge toll and
proposes to do so.
The Supervisors notified him that on
the first oomplaint he would be arrested,
and as he insists on taking toll a test case
may be looked for in a few days.
MONTERET'S WOULD-BE SUICIDE.
Alfred Diaz Thrice Wooed Death and IÂ»
JVotr Battling for Life.
MONTEREY, Cal., â¢Sept. 21.â Alfred
Diaz, the young man who a few weeks ago
attempted suicide here, was taken this
morning to San Francisco to undergo an
X-ray examination. Diaz tried to shoot
himself with a revolver. The bullet
entered his right side and presumably
lodged there, but the physicians have been
unable to locate it and are therefore
anxious that the new system of internal
photopraphy should be tried. The doc
tors informed young Diaz that if the ball
was not found and removed he would die.
Diaz came to the conclusion that, after
having three times attempted to take his
own life and failed, he would rather live.
Diaz is a young man about 24 years of
age and a member of one of the oldest and
most respected Spanish families in Mon
terey. No cause has ever been found for
his trying to kill himself.

Los Angeles, Cal., Sept. 21.)
Politics in this end of the State is warm

Hobart is to the front in every sectien.
The meetings are largely attended and

BOND AT LAKEPORT.
Bryan* a Financial i rgumtnta Answered
by a Democrat.
LAKEPORT, Cal., S-pt. 20.â Hon.
Thomas B. Bond, who has just returned
from the National Democratic Conven
tion, and who is one of the California
Palmer and Buckner electors, addressed a
large audience on financial issues here
Saturday night. He began by referring to
the Chicago platform and Mr. Bryan's
public utterances, and told what they pro
posed to do. There were three monetary
ratios â one of weight, one of Jsize and one
of value. Mr. Bryan advocated the one of
weight. He would nave the Government
coin the silver of the world and try to
make the people accept it at par when
there was only 52 cents in a silver dollar.
The Government never did, couid not
now and never could create value. All it
could do with free and unlimited coinage
wouid be to guarantee fineness and weight.
Under our present standard, he said, the
Government stood behind each silver dol
lar, or price of paper money or subsidiary
coin, and guarantees to redeem it in gold
at the option of the holder, and it was
this that made them circulate at par.
Silver has the same price all over the
world, he declared, and in order to raise
that price we would have to corner the
silver of the world. But Mr. Bryan said
that the unlimited demand would brine
silver up from 66 cents an ounce to $1 29
an ounce. If this was true, why did sil
ver and gold both fluctuate prior to 1873,
when we bad free coinage of both metals?
Fir t we had all gold and then all silver,
and if Congress could not wed them then
it could not now. It was the cost of pro
duction that created value, and Congress
could not regulate that. Prior to 1873
seven tons of silver were produced to one
of gold; now twenty tons of silver to one
of gold were produced. This was what
caused the difference in price.
And again: If thirteen of the leading
Governments of the world by demonetiz
ing silver sent it to its present price, could
one Government alont? restore it? Would
it not require an international agreement?
As a resut of this speech quite a number
of gold Democrats have come out for
Palmer and Buckner and still others for
McKinley and Hobart. The sound money
movement is growing daily in Lake
County.

LOB9NG VOTES TO BRIAN.
Old- Line Democrats Opposed to the
Hl'itr-Cntor Combine.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., 21.âSena
tor White ana John W. Mitchell returned
from San Francisco this : morning on the
same train. "Silver John" is popularly
supposed to carry inside State secrets in
his innermost pocket, and in consequence
he was ' much in demand to-day by the
small-fry politicians, ward-heelers and
legislative candidates.
It has been whispered about the streets
for some days that Governor Budd is get
ting ready to turn loose the dogs of war
upon the White-Cator combine to control
two sessions of the California Legislature
in the interest of the parties to the deal.
Mitchell is known to be a warm friend of
Governor Budd's, hence to-day's jam to
see the ''Cahuenpa statesman." To a
Call correspondent Mitchell said:
"You may quote me as saying that Per
kins will not be re-elected in a thousand
years. As to Budd's right against the
Cator-White fusion scheme, I know noth
ing; but there is no question about an
amicable understanding between the two
gentlemen, and I understand tnat the
dicker will lose many a vote to Mr.
Bryan â but this is only hearsay.
"One thing you fellows have not ob
served, and that is, as I figure it, there is
a pretty good chance for a deadlock in next
winter's Legislature, wherein White will
lose nothing; and in the event of Bryan's
election he can practically control the Cal
ifornia appointments. Moreover, a dead
lock suggests the possibilities of a dark
horse, you know, and you may guess at
the rest; but Perkins will not be re-elected
â never."
Many of the old line Democrats here
do not hesitate to say that the Cator-
White alliance will iose Bryan thousands
of votes in Southern California, which is
affording Republicans considerable com
fort.
The Democratic candidates of the
fusion combine do not say they will vote
for Cator in the event of their election,
but on that point manage to cautiously
give it out that they will support a silver
man.

MORA HONORED
AT SANTA CRUZ
Farewell Reception to the
Retiring Bishop of
Monterey.
SOON LEAVES FOR SPAIN
Parishioners Attest Their Regard
for the Venerable
Prelate.
PRAISE HIS NOBLE CAREER.
The Good That He Has Done to Cali
lornians Recounted in a
Tender Address.
SANTA CRUZ. Cat.., Sept. 21.â The ven
erable Bishop Mora, who ha 3 just resigned
the bishopric of Monterey and Los An
geles, was the recipient of a farewell recep
tion at the pastorage of the Holy Cross
yesterday, preparatory to his departure to
morrow for San Francisco and Los An
geles, thence on the 19th of October for
Barcelona, Spain.
The address on behalf of the parishion
ers was read by J. 11. Leonard, a member
of the Youug Men's Institute. It was one
of masterly tenderness, and was listened to
by Bishop, priest and layman with rapt
attention. It recounted the days in the
early forties, when the young man left his
Spanish home of luxury to brave the hard
life of Western Amercia; how he was
ordained one of the first three priests in
this djocese in 1856; how ne had by daily
and hourly taking up the cross and the
thorns won the miter in 1375 and for
twenty-three years had been Bishop of this
diocese. It dwelt upon his great love for
all children, especially orphans; his keen
foresieht aud able judgment in placing
Rev. Father McN'amee in charge of Holy
Cross Parish, Santa Cruz, wherein during
his service of the past fourteen years such
vast improvements had been made, sucli
as the Holy Cross Church and the Centen
nial Arch. The address closed with the
words:
"Kind Bishop, farewell. You go from
our midst to seek that well-deserved rest
which comes to those who entered early i
into the vineyard of our Lord and bore the j
heat and the toil of the day. Our fare
well is one of sacred memoriesâ memories
sanctified by our great religion and our
humble Master."
Bishop Mora displayed visible signs of !
emotion when he thanked his parishion- {
ers. He alluded to the good feeling which j
had always existed between himself and j
non-Catholics â not only -"rotestants but j
Hebrews â and tbe Kindness and assistance i
be had received from them. He spoke of
Father McNarnee as a father speaks of his
loved son. He pointed with pride to the
pastor's work and closed with a benedic
tion upon tbe parishioners assembled to do
him such honor.
lirief speeches laudatory of the Bishop
and Father McNamee were made by Lieu
tenunt-Governor Jeter, Senator Burke,
Superior Judge Logan and C. K. Younger.
Father McNamee made a brief address,
supplemented by a few words from Father
Dord, and thus closed tbe faithful public
life of Bishop Mora in Santa Cruz.

One of the SlephitiM Mephitica Tribe
Slain on thÂ« Grounds.
DEL MONTE, Cal., Sept. 21.â The sun
shone brightly on this eventful morning
at Del Monte, and the opening notes of
the morning concert by Huber's orchestra
wooed the belated breakf asters from their
mccl to the pleasant piazza. The news
gent was busy arranging his wares in
tempting positions upon his stand in tbe
corner of the porch. Suddenly the tip of
his nose elevated itself and at the same
instant the noses of the musicians under
went a change, and they gazed round
amazed while the plaintive air they were
rendering was suffered to drag a trifle too
perceptibly. A man who was seated at
the opposite end of the piazza was readkig
a New York paper. He dropped it, sniffed
disgustedly and went indoors. Just then
a knot of ladies walked through the oilice
gayly talking, but upon opening the door
the talk ceased instantly, and handker
chiefs, books and anything else available
went quickly to their noses, and they
turned immediately back into the office.
Soon the porch was deserted save by the
devoted orchestrians, whose melody grew
more plaintive till finally it ceased in one
long, despairing wail, ana they too went
indoors to spend an intermission in taking
breath.
Finally, Frank Casserly, equipped with
his inevitable pipe in full blast, opened
the door, passed out through tbe porch
and on into the grounds unscathed, but
another man trying to follow his example
turned back from the door vanquished.
Just as Professor Huberand his coworkers
were about to return to a voluntary mar
tyrdom a shot rang out upon the sunlit
air, and then a Chinaman's shrill shout,
"You shootee him heap good," and all
that remained of a full-grown polecat was
tenderly conveyed from the driveway in
front of the hotel to its last long sleeD in
the all-embracing arms of mother earth.
The tragedy was ended and Del Mante
reoumed Us smile. As to the animal:
"Requies(pole)cat in pace."

SASTA ROSA'S INDIAN SCARE.
Jied.ikina Drink J>'irotoater and Start
Upon the Warpath.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 21.â A band
of Indians employed in picking hops in
the outskirts of tois city succeeded in get
ting hold of several gallons of red wine
yesterday, and at once went on the war
path. Five big bucks became crazed with
liquor, and, arming themselves with clubs,
made an attack upon the whites in the
hop-elds. There were many women and
children encamped In the neighborhood,
and the iierce warwhoops of the red?kins
frightened them almost into srnsms. A
posse of officers from this city was soon on
the ground and after a bard struggle suc
ceeded in handcuffing the ringleaders and
landing them in the county jail. Should
the person who sold the Indians the wine
be discovered the full penalty of tbe law
will be his share.

AURORA, Oe., Sept. 21.â Mrs. Mary
j Dolan, wife of a Portland merchant, who
! has been visiting friends here, met with a
I fatal accident yesterday. She and another
1 woman, accompanied by a gentleman, had
I been attending a dance, and on their way
j home were obliged to cross a bridjre in

I the first to be taken across by her escort.
B lie was admonished to remain quietly on
a certain spot until the other woman was
brought over. Instead, Mrs. Dolan moved
I about, wnen suddenly her foot struck a
j jackscrew and she was precipitated a dis
j tance of forty-eight feet over the partly
dismantled bridge.
The unfortunate woman gave one scream
of despair during her rapid descent to
death and after that never uttered a cry.
When assistance reached her she was dead.
11 er body was sent to Po.-tland.

CHICO, Cal., Sept. 21.â T. E. Koon, a

i robbed of $75 by a highwayman on the
j Frattville road sixty-five miles from this
city. Koon was returning from a peddling

-1 proached him and aaked for a ride. The
: peddler allowed the stranger to take a

the muzzle ol a snote tin to his heau, de
manding money. Koon, taken by sur

â  g"n, and made the peddler drive down the
j road. Then the robber disappeared in Hie

DARING FEAT AT SUMMIT

Wins $300 by Risking His Life (n a
Snow- Topped Timber Three
Incfces Wide.
SUMMIT, Cal., Sept. 21.â Frank Rod
rigues, a daring young Portuguese, this
morning successfully walked across tbe
3-inch guard rail, 400 feet from terra
lirma, on the bridge spanning Lower Cas
cade Canyon, and won a wager of $300.
He is employed a 9 a sectionhand at Cas
cade, and by his daring wait of less than
two minutes he realized more money than
he could earn on the railroad In six
months. Harry Denton, a young gam
bler, who doubted Rodrignes' ability to
walk the rail, is onts3oo, but is not crying.
"Rodrigues is welcome to every cent of
it. Any man who can muster the nerve
to cross that rail as did Rodrigues, and
under the samÂ« conditions, is welcome to
all my money," said Denton after the feat
had been accomplished.
The trip was made shortly after a heavy
snowfall and the rail was covered with
snow, on which the snn was at the time
shining, causing it to melt rapidly.

REPAIRS NEEDED
AT THE CAPITOL
Secretary of State Brown
Files His Biennial
Report.
WHERE COIN IS WANTED
Improvements on the Public
.Building at Sacramento
Recommended.
HOW TO LESSEN EXPENSE.
Servants of the People Not Always
Diligent in Seeking to
Economize.
, SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sspt. -I.âSecre
tary of State Lewis H. Brown has tiled
his first biennial report with the Gov
ernor, and it will shortly go to the State
Printer. The report is one of the most
explicit in detail that has ever been issued
from the Secretary of State's office.
After reciting the duties entailed upon
the occupant of the office, the document
sets forth that pardons have been granted
in nineteen felony cases, 027 felons have
been restored to citizenship, pardons were
granted in 17 misdemeanor cases, sen
tences of 45 persons commuted, 12 re
prieves of sentences granted, .24 procla
mations offering rewards in murder cases
issued, 390 land patents were signed,
157 C notaries and 50 commissioners of
deeds appointed, 224 executive appoint
ments made, 22 bonds approved, and 4
proclamations issued. The report gives a
full list of articles of incorporation tiled,
number of certificates issued and attested,
and shows the total receipts of the office
since July 1. 1894, to be $46,552 93 for fees
and sale of statutes, stationery, etc.
In speaking of the Capitol building the
Secretary of State says:
Notwithstanding the large amount of money,
expended during the past lew years upon the
building In repair;; and improvements, I find
I the interior o( many of the offices, the roof
' and the plumbing of the building sadly in
j want of repairs, and find that many uncom-
I plimentary comments are made by visitors on
i the condition of the interior of the building.
The entire structure should be ventilated, as
; when erected ventilation was entirely ignored.
The basement is never free from the foulest of
; air. Many parts therein are as free from light
i as "Egyptian Darkness." There is no fire pro
> tection and standpipes should be erected
| reaching to the attic for use in case of fire
I catching in the dome. The walls surrounding
1 the corridors are sadly iv need of whitening
: and the lavatories are of antiquated plum Ding
; and a menace to the health of the mates of
â  tl.e building. .
During the rains ot two winters the roof has
i leaked badly in many places, requiring over
I twenty tubs to catch the drippings, and being
of copper . and extremely susceptible to the
heat of the sun it is impossible to make it rain
proof.
The report then recites all the improve
| ments that have been' made during the
: present administration With the limited
] funds available.
After giving a list of appropriations and
, expenditures and making certain recom
: mendations .relating, to the care of the
State archives the report recommends
j the introduction of electric power to op
i crate the pumps, claiming thereby a sav
| ing to the State of $2000 annually. The
I construction of a well is also recommend
ed in order to secure water for irrigating
purposes and for use throughout tbe build
ing. This, it is estimated, would result in
i a saving of $1800 a year to the Slate, that
i amount how being expended for water.
Tne amending of section 410' of -the'
Political Code relating to the fees of the
Secretary of Slate's office Is also advocated,
as is the act relating to the tiling of certi
ficates, etc., and after including full es
timates of all the expenditures, etc., the
report closes with the following:
To economize has been our constant nim.
Retrenchment in tbe State government should
: receive the first consideration of every ofliclal.
He is but a servant of the people and often a
: dispenser of their money. It is due to the
people of California, and the taxpayers in par
; ticular, that economy should be enforced in
, all departments of the State government. One
i should not be extravagant or careless with
public money. Because an appropriation is
I made of $100, 000 the sum should not be ex
pended, simply because it is available, when a
less amount will answer the purpose for *vhich
' tbe appropriation was made. A study should
j be made how to save, and not how tosoend.
The people should be enlightened in detail
; where their 'money is expended, and the ne
cessity for all public expenditure?.
The State Board of Examiners should not be
j clerical, but all that the title implies. Much
is expected ot the board by the people, but it
j is not at present clothed with sufficient power.
The board should be the legal body to exam
ine into all State affairs, and by doing away
with the worthless but costly expense of hav
ing members of . the Legislature make their
Diennial tours the State would save thousands
of dollars. It is very unsatisfactory to approve
claim after claim presented to the board with
out a thorough knowledge of said claims, tne
cost of the items of supplies in the open mar
ket, quality and quantity furnished, and the
j labor performed. The State should get value
I received in all transactions. and the benefit of
I a doubt when there is one. An inventory
should be made of all State property bien
nially, a debit and credit account opened with
each institution and department and all prop
pert)' belonging to the State properly entered.
The Inventory can be made by the proper offi
cials without expense and reported to the
State Board of Examiners. : ..
All pub.ic funds should be kept sacred and
intact for the specific purpose for which the
appropriation was made, nor shtrsid any ex
penditure be permitted nor a charge against
the State created unless the appropriations for
said expenditure* are previously made by the
Legislature. The practice of enacting laws re
quiring the payment of public money without
the necessary appropriations, thereby necessi
j tating payments . from other funds, following
the custom "first come, first served," causing
a deficit in the general fund to the loss and
inconvenience of regular claimants and offi
cials, and opening the doors to deficiencies, is
wrong in principle, injurious to the people in
practice and vicious irom a business stand
point. -,* All moneys received in behalf of the
Mate, no matter from: what source or by what
person, should be paid direct to the State
treasury, and contingent and other funds not
provided for by appropriations should be pro
hibited by ; law. So Stale money - whatever
could then be expended without being drawn
from the treasury rough the regular channel.
It is not sufficient for. an official to save what
he can to the taxpayers by.cuttintr down the
appropriation for bis particular office, institu
tion, board or commission whenever potgible,
not using all the appropriation if be can avoid
doing so, permitting no deficiency, but he
should be equally watchful of other appropria
tions, claims for which pass through his hands.
The official who makes -no attempt toward
economy U not doing ; his , duty to the people,
â¢nd is deterring of censure.
â  From the condition of things one would be
compelled to : believe, as a result "of investiga
tions, but little care has been manifested in
protecting. the interest of the taxpayers. Fre
quently : men I follow in the footsteps of their
â¢predecessors, keeping in the same old rut, fol
lowing ola-time customs, without the thought
or care of improvement or the welfare of their
constituent. It is not sufficient that an offi
cial or employe should mechanically earn his
(salary, but If he will he can more than save
his salary and often many times over by proper
devotion to the welfare of the State. An offi
cial should have not only the desire as well as
the best of intentions to do what is right, but
should make it his business to go out of his
way and .if necessary investigate public ex
penditures,- pain a practical knowledge out
side of his office as well as in it of the necessi
ties for the vast appropriations of State money
that are made. 2 He should go into details and
familiarize' himself with the conduct of State
institutions, and ascertain upon what business
lines they are being conducted. The transac
tions of this Slate are j large, footing up mil.
lions of dollars per annum, and its affairs
should be conducted upon ttrictly business
principle*,
CLAIMS AGAINST THE STATE.
Sundry Bills Considered by fhe Board of
Examinersâ The Coyote Scalp
Casi Arouses Wrath.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 21. â The
State Board of Examiners met this after
noon with all the member:, present. After
passing the usual routine bills the claim
of T. M. Broderick for $151 71, loss of coal
falling into tbe bay from wharves known
as section 4 in San Francisco, was consid
ered and rejected.
The bill presented by the Risdon Iron
Works in the sum of $12, 150 14 was al
lowed. This is the first contract on which
pay-out begins in the San Francisco depot
fund. Â«
A. Greeninger, chairman of the Board
of Supervisors of Santa Clara County, will
be subpenaed before the board to explain
why a number of children for whom tbat
county has been drawing State aid have
not increased in age for the last two years.
Greeninger swore to an affidavit tbat he
knew each of the beneficiaries, and that
each was under the age of 13 years. The
returns show that John Breeman was 13
years old on July 1, 1894, and tne same age
on January, 189 G.
J. J. Cook, who rented tbe Stoneman
House in Yosemite Valley, presented a
bill for $100 paid in advance on rent by
him Defore the hotel burned. Governor
Budd presented a telegram sent to him by
Mr. Cook on August 20 asking for consent
to close the hotel, stating he had been los
ing money. The Governor referred Cook
to tbe Valley Commissioners. Five days
later the hotel was burned. The bill was
laid over.
The claim or C. S. Merrill for takin- j
testimony at a court-martial in San Fran
cisco, amounting to $113160, was rtcom- I
mended to the Legislature. This had
been referred to Secretary Brown, who
reported favorably.
The claim of the estate of A. H. Wing,
killed during the strike by the accidental
discharge of a musket in the bands of one
of the National Guardsmen during the
strike, was recommended. Wing was on
the public streets aud was not opposing
the guards stationed at the armory in
iracramento. Tne bill was pa#sed by the
last Legislature and pocketed by Governor
Budd.
The matter of coyote scalp claims was
brought to the attention of the Board of
Examiners, to-day and the board has
unanimously declared for war. It seems
tbat the country has been flooded with
misleading circulars sent out by collection
agencies and law firms.
CORBETT ASKS MUCH.
Demands 0.000 to Agree to I'lght
Here, Whether the Match Comes
Off or >*ot. . ' . -
A reDort was current yesterday, and was
given credence by an evening paper, that
Shsrkey and Corbett hud agreed to fight
ten rounds in this City before the Eureka
Athletic Club for a purse of $12,000. " , "â ;;
The Eureka Club obtained a permit yes
terday for a tighten November 21, and it
was said this was for the great contest.':
Alfred Ellingbouse, who was said to be
handling the matter, was not about hi?
usual haunts last evening, but little faith [
was placed in the story by local sDorts.
As an argument against it and in sup
port of his assertion that the National
Club is still in the negotiations he showed '
the following telegram received from Cor
bett yesterday : " ,<
Asbcey Pau'k, N. J.. Sept. 21, 1890.
v J. J. Groom, 91,! Market street, San yranciteo: \
You deposit $10,000 with Examiner at once
â  for Sharkey and I to box ten rounds, and we to
receive purse whether or not fight is pulled off. ',
We will fight between tne _Oth and 30th of
November. Saw Lynch and this is satisfactory '
to him. i Answer at once so I can maice prepa
tion 8 to go out there. ' James J. Cukbett.
"Corbett would hardly have signed !
with this new concern, of which no one
seems to know anything, on : the me day
that he forwarded this," said Mr. Groom. |
WISH TO ARGUE AGAIN
The County - Government Act May
Again Come Before the Supreme
Court. *
Garret McEnerney, acting as attorney
for the Board of Election Commissioners
of this City and CouiHy,' filed a petition
with lie Supreme Court yesterday ask
ing for leave to make an oral argument in
â  favor of an application for a modification
of the opinion of the court in the suit of
Julius Kahn vs. Adolph ; Sutro et al., in
effect to determine the tenure of offices of
local incumbents. At the beginning of
the petition Mr. - McEnerney gives his
reasons for asking for this unusual privi
lege. Briefly summed up, these reasons
are before the decision in this case, hereto
fore lendered, shall have become final, the
'time within which to make nominations
for municipal offices and the time within
which to call an election to till such
municipal offices will' have expired; that
if a rehearing should be granted about the
thirtieth day after the date .of that
opinion great confusion and uncertainty
will a ise; that the respondents are reluc
tant to abide by the judgment pronounced
heretofore until it shall;. have become
final by the lapse of thirty days from the
rendition thereof or by, the refusal of the
court to order a rehearing. : . !

County.

TOOK FEES WHILE ON SALAEY
Drew From the State Treasury $670 ;
for Prosecuting Foreclosure
Suits-
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Sept. 21.-The
1 Grand Jury now in session has riled an
I accusation aeainst Alvin Fay, District At
torney of Kern County, to have him re
moved from office. The proceedings are
based upon the charge that be collected
$670 from the State of California for fore-
I closing the interests of delinquent pur
chases of State school lands. After re
citing the facts of bringing the sixty-seven
school land suits, the accusation states
' that Fay presented a claim for costs in the
! sum of $4053 04 to Controller Colgan, and
j it was allowed by the State Examiners
, and paid by the State Treasurer. The
{ claim included an allowance of $10 altor
j ney's fees for each suit, amounting to $670.
I Tlie accusation declares:
That said Alvin Fay, while acting in his
official capacity as District Attorney of Kern
j County, ia which capacity he prosecuted said
: actions and received payment of said sum of
I money h> aforesaid, is not now and was not at
I any time or at all entitled to receive for his
: own use or benefit the ?aid sum of $670 so
i collected by him, or any part or portion
\ thereof; but that said sum, and the whole
I thereof, inured to said Kern County, and said
; county was aud is entitled to said sum of
i money, and the whole thereof, and it became
! and was the duty of Â«aid Alvin Fay to collect
the said sum of $670 from the State of Cali
fornia and pay the tame over to the Treasurer
of Kern County, for the use and benefit oi
I baid county; but, disregarding his said duty,
and having the said sum of $670 m
his possession and control, as aforesaid,
by virtue of his sala trust, ho, the said
Alvin Fay, did, on the 20th day of
May, 1880, wllliully and fraudulently and
! corruptly and contrary to the due and lawful
I execution of his said trust appropriate tbe
said sum of $670, and the wnole thereof, to bis
I own use, knowing the same to be wrong, and
1 wit ti a willful and fraudulent and corrupt in
-1 tent to convert the same to his own use,
thereby to defraud said county contrary to the
force and effect of the statute iv such cases
; made Â»nd provided, and against tbe pence and
dignity of the people Of the State of California.
Wherefore plaintiff and said Grand jury
i pray that said defendant, Alvin Fay, be only
; cited to appear before the honorable court,
! and that upon duo hearing hereof said Alvin
; Fay be removed from his said office as District
Attorney of Kern County, State of California.
The District Attorneys of counties of
! the class of Kern are paid $2000 for all
services required of them by law. The
foreclosure of the interests of delinquent
! purchasers of State school lands in the
I respective counties is a duty imposed by
law upon District Attorneys where so di
rected by the Stiite. Mr. Fay has served
I one or two terms of office before as Dis
; trict Attorney, and it was his custom to
retain all such money for his own use.
Dunnp that time the District Attorney
was allowed to retain certain fees, but
now under the present county govern
ment Act he is paid a salary.
Mr. Fay was in Los Angeles when the
\ accusation was filed and has not yet re
! turned. What his defense will be cannot
1 be foretold. It is said that be maintains
I that he is legally entitled to retain such
! money. The demand for Fay's removal
! is said to have emanated directly from the
i office of the Attorney-Generai.
THE TRIAL AT VISALIA.
Ira Hawkins Gives Damaging
Testimony Against
Ardell.
Says H; Resembles Lovren's Com
panion en the Night of th:
Tagus Affair.
VI3ALIA, Cal., Sept. 21.â Some dam
aging testimony against the defendant
was given to-day in the case of the Peopie
vs. Charles Ardell, charged with com
plicity in the attempted robbery of a
Southern Pacific train on the night of
March 18 near Tagus.
On June 13 Charles Araell testified in
the Lovren case that he had met and
drunk with Dan McCall on the Monday
preceding the attempted robbery, aud that
he asked McCall what he was doing. Mc-
Call said be was chopping wood, Ardeil
said, "Isn't this pretty hot weather chop
ping wood." McCall replied that it was,
but that he and his partner intended to
take a lay off and go to the mountains for
a trirj. In refutation of this testimony
Hon. Alfred Daggett, the father of Earl
Daggett, the young Under Sheriff who de
fended the train and tired the shot that
killed Dan McCall, was called and testified
as to the condition of the weather during a
portion of March. On the 7th of March,
at 6 a. m., it was frosty and the thermome
ter registered 36 degrees. On March 16,
17 and 18 the weather was somewhat
cloudy and the mercury ranged from 58
to 73 degrees.
Tbe surprise of the day came when Ira
Hawkins took the stand and reiterated his
testimony given in the Lovren case.
Hawkins said he WU awakened about 2
o'clock on the morning of the 19th of
March by William Baleh. He drives the
'bus from the Palace Hotel to the depot,
and as he was going out of the hotel to
attend to hi 3 work he saw Si Lovren and
another man drive east along Main street
hi a buggy with me top thrown back.
They were going at a pretty fast gait,
and tin; horse appeared to have been
driven hard. They turned from Court
street into Main, and the light from the
hotel fell full upon Lovren's face. The
two men drove to Church street and
there turned south. A few minutes after
this Ardell and Clark came up to the hotel
and took a drink.
Hawkins testified that the man with
Lovren closely resembled Charles Ardell.

GUTHRIE.O.T., Sept. 21.-Harrison Har
mon, Thomas Hen and Edward Harring
ton were arrested yesterday on a charge of

with counterfeit halves and quarters.

THE RAINEYITES
WERE SATISFIED
Sam's Rule of the Junta
Convention Is Not Fur
ther Disputed.
FOR SUPERIOR JUDGES.
All Nominations Will Be in Open
Convention by the Rainey
Majority.
THE LEGISLATIVE TICKET.
Murasky, Dunne, Borden and Sander-
son for the Bench and J. C.
Bunner for Surveyor.
Sam Rainey'f convention drew a crowd
last night big enough to till Odd Fellows'
Hall to the doors. The galleries were
largely filled with curious Buckieyites.
The Democratic politicians expected to
enjoy something lively, but nothing fierce
occurred. The auti-Raineyites, having se
cured the nomination for Mayor, will not
interfere with Rainey and Lanigan getting
what they want out of the rest of the
ticket and they will swallow it and say
nothing.
A copy of the new charter was
on every Beat when the doors opened,
but a majority of the " push "
scorned the copies. Chairman Ragan
started out with an evident intention to
hold the convention down to order, and as
nothing occurred to ruffle the temper of
the Rainey majority the convention was
disorderly only in a free and easy way.
The convention assembled late and ac
complished little. The legislative ticket
was approved with one exception after an
hour's consideration. The exception was
in the Thirty-seventh District, where
Harry I. Muicreevy proposes to hang on to
the nomination by the Buckieyites o' the
district which tie has also received.
The convention decided to have no com
mittees to report tickets for the judiciary.
Board of Supervisors or Board of Educa
tion, and when the judicial nominations
were taken up the convention went as far
as the Superior Judges and adjourned
after nominating Frank H. Dunne, Frank
J. Murasky. A. A. Sanderson and Rhodes
Borden.
The delay in starting the proceedings
resulted from the inability of the commit
tee on platform and resolutions to agree
on the committee plan referred to it and
it was 9 p. m. when Chairman Ragan
called tbe impatient assemblage to order.
Secretary Saulman began calling for re
ports when Eugene N. Deuprey plumped
an innovation into Democratic conven
tion methods. He wanted it told who the
Legislative candidates were and suggested
tttat tbe chairman of the discrict delega
tions be called to the platform to give the
desired information. Mr. Deuprey didn't
anticipate that he was springing a circus
on the crowd.
The chairman ordered the process with
out taking a vote and called the chairman
of the Twenty-eighth District delegation
to come to tne platform. P. D. Mullaney
responded and tbe circus began with the
great big guffaw that rose, mingled with
shoutings ( f funny things.
"Mr. Lacy was born and raised in our
district. He has been employed in Wells-
Farpo's and he's about 25 years of age,"
was the identification finally given.
A delegate wanted to expedite matters
by quitting the operation, but Mr. Deu
prey declared, "We are expected to act
like intellectual beings and not like a lot
of cattle," and the process continued.
The information about John Allen of
the Twenty-ninth, given by Mr. Brannan
amid the jollity, was simply that Mr.
Alleu had lived in the district several
years and would carry it.
P. J. Farrell of the" Thirtieth said that
Eugene J. Hannon was assistant superin
tendent of the Youth's Directory.
Chairman Ginty of the Thirty-first was
greeted with a revel of cheering and josh
ing.
Some time later the chairman an
nounced that James P. Brady was a young
architect.
They had a lot more fun with Mr.
Grady of the Thirty-second. W. H. Mc-
Ivor *of the Thirty-sixth was asked by
Osgood Putman if Henry McGrath had
not been nominated by "another so
called Democratic convention," and Mr.
Mclvor explained that he had, but had
resigned.
Thomas J. Burke, chairman of the dis
trict, said that Harry Muicreevy was the
only Democrat in the district who could
carry it. He is in the Recorder's office,
pnrtMr. Burke was sorry to say that he
was on the Buckley ticket.
This started another kick about the in
dorsement of Bjckieyites, and Thomas F.
Barry moved that the report of tbe Thirty
seventh be referred back to the district
convention, with instructions to act. The
motion was carried.
Charles S. Peery of the Thirty-eighth
was identified as a young attorney, and J.
6. Wardeil of the Thirty-ninth as a news
paper man.
Healey Davis told that Frank A. Schmitz
of the Forty-first was a foreman in a
plating works, a native son and one of the
most popular nominees on tbe ticket.
Bernard Augonett of the Forty-second
turned out a coal merchant, and George
M. Rubenstein of the Forty-third a barber.
Edward S. Ryan, the nominee in the
Forty-fourth, is a boot and shoe man.
Clitus Barbsur spoke for William Gately
of the Forty-fifth.
The Senatorial nominees were likewise
vouched for, though little information was
given.
Harry I. Muicreevy of the Thirty-sev
enth was allowed to speak in his own be
half. He said in reference to the Buckley
nomination that he had been indorsed at
a mass-meeting, but he had not been offi
cially notified of any nomination.
All the nominations except that of the
Thirty-seventh were approved Dy the con
vention. It was announced that the
Thirty-seventh District convention would
reconvene tlais evening in Judge Troutt's
courtroom.
The Legislative ticket as approved was
as follows :

Alex. T. Vogelsang, chairman of the
committee on resolutions, took the plat
form, when, at 10 o'clock, the legislative
matter was finally disposed of, and sub
mitted the committee's report on tbe reso
lutions referred to it, providing; for the ap
pointment of three committees to report,
respectively, nominees for judicial posi
tions, for tbe Board of Supervisors and
Board of Education.
The committee recommended that no
committee on judicial nominations be ap
pointed, such nominations to be made in
open convention.
The committee unanimously recom
mended that Supervisors be nominated
by the convention at large. [Much ap
plause.] It was further recommended
that names be called for by wards, and
that names be handed to the secretary in
writing, no further action to be taken upon
them for three days.
As to the Board of Education there was
a majority and a minority report, the
former favoring the committee plan and
the latter recommendme nominations in
open convention. Tbe minority report
was signed by six members.
Eugene N. Deuprey moved the adoption
of the rrajority report, but it was decided
to take up the recommendations seriatim.
The first and the second portions of the
report were adopted without discussion,
the second with applause.

Directors was quickly adopted, without
discussion, and tnus all nominations were
left with tbe convention as a whole.
Alex T. VogeUang nominated J. C. Bun
ner for Surveyor. Mr. Bunner was nom
inated by acclamation.
William Asmussen, the candidate for
Treasurer, being present he appeared for
a moment and indorsed the platform
briefly.
On motion of James E. O'Donnell judi
cial nominations were taken up, and ex-
Senator H. C. Gesford named for Superior
Judge, Frank H. Dunne. There were
cheers for Dunne.
Eugene N. Deuprey followed with the
nomination of Rhodes Borden, now in the
City and County Attorney's office.
James E. O'Donnell nominated ex-Jus
tice of the Peace Frank J. Murasky.
Alex T. Vogelsang nominated A. A. ex-
Judge Sanderson and M. C. Hassett pre
sented the name of Thomas E. Ctirran.
When nominations were closed Eugene
N. Deuprey put in a request that Mr.
O'Donnell state the fact that his candidate
has resigned "another nomination," re
ferring to the nomination by tbe Buckiey
ites of Frank J. Murasky.
The process of voting for four of the five
candidates by rollcall was a tedious one.
Tho result was as follows: Dnnne 556,
Murasky 541, Borden 526, Sanderson 443,
Curran 212.
The first four named were declared the
nominees for the Superior bench.

These were all the nominations made
last night by the convention in B'nai
B'rith Hall.
When the convention was called to
order at 8:40 o'clock about one
quarter of tbe delegates' chairs were
vacant. These were filled up by friends of
the delegates sitting and standing in the
lobbies, at the solicitation of tbe delegates,
who were anxious to make a good show
ing as to numbers.
H. F. Sonntag called tbe meeting to
order and overruled a motion to dispense
with the call of the roll. While tbe names
were being called by the secretary two
delegates arose to protest against outsid
ers answering "here" to the names of ab
sentees. They were suppressed by the
sergeant-at-arms.
The committee on order of business
made an additional report providing that
the seats of delegates who have been or
shall be absent for two meetings unrepre
sented by proxies shall be declared va
cant, and tbe vacancies shall by the
County Central Committee.
The reading of tbe following resolution
was greeted with prolonged applause :
Whkrkas, The price to consumers of gas and
electric lighting in tnls City is out of all pro
portion to prices charged in other cities ; and
whereas, the consolidation into one corpora
tion of the San Francisco Gat and Electric
Light companies has materially reduced the
cost of production ut said gas andelectrlc;iight,
while at the same time creating a monopoly
to uphold exorbitant Drices charged to con
sumers; therefore be it!
Betolved, That this convention pledges its
nominees for the offices of Mayor and the
Board of Supervisors to reduce the rates
charged for said illuminants to the lowest pos
sible figureâ not to exceed 25 per cent on ex
ceeding rates.
The resolution was referred to the com
mittee on platform and resolutions.
A resolution indorsing the nomination
of Thomas B. O'Brien for Congress from
the Fourth District was unanimously
adopted with a yell, on motion of A.
Ruef.
A. Rnef took the platform, holding be
tween his forefinger and thumb a $10 piece.
This he handed to the secretary with a
pull-back motion, but the string was in
visible and the secretary got it. He then
placed Horace Davis in nomination for the
mayoralty, and eulogized that gentle
man's record in Congress on the issue of
the restriction of Chinese immigration.
Mr. Ruef added that Mr. Davis would ac
cept the nomination, which announce
ment caused great cheering. Mr. Davis
was declared the nominee by acclamation.
Senator Mahoney moved that H. P.
Sonntag, A. Ruef, C. 8. Laumeister, E. B.
Read and Jacob Lev! be appointed a com
mittee to notify Mr. Davis of his nomina
tion.
AY. A. Richaidson nominated Asa R.
Wells for the auditorship, and he was
confirmed by acclamation.
Mr. Wells came forward, paid his $10
and accepted the gift of Martin Kelly with
thanks.
On motion of Delegate Seligsohn Henry
S. Martin was declared the nominee of the
convention for Treasurer.
Mr. Martin was not present.
Then ti:e convention adjourned until 8
o'clock this evening.
Immediately after adjournment the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District conven
tion met for the purpose of nominating a
candidate for Assemblyman from that dis
trict W. T. Kibbler, Arthur McGuerren
and Joseph Hirsch were named and an
adjournment was taken until this evening.
NOT A ONE-WINGER.
Horace Davis Nominated by the
Fakirs Without His Con
sent.
Horace Davis was seen by a Call re
porter at his residence last night and was
asked whether he intended to accept the
nomination. Mr. Davis said :
"I have not consulted any one about tbe
nomination, nor has any one consulted
me. It would not be of any use for me to
entertain a proposition to stand for office
unless the party was united here. I
could not afford to run as a candidate of
any one wing ot the party.
"Even if the party were united I would
not accept a nomination unless I were
given a good Board of Supervisors, with
whom I could work so as to secure an
honest administration of the city's affairs.
"The union of the party in San Fran
cisco will help the State ticket very much.
The State oueht to be carried for McKin
ley. Ido not think there lms been such
a vital iseue before the people of the
United States for the last thirty years. It
has obliterated ail the party lines just as
they were obliterated in 1860.
"The State election is tne great thing to
be kept in view."
TO-DAY'S CONVENTION.
A Few of the Candidates Who Will
Contest Tor Nominations.
The regular Republican County Con
vention will meet at 2 o'clock this after
noon. There will be a fall attendance of
delegates, tbe proxy system being dis
pensed with, as it is liable to all kinds of
abuses.
Thomas D. Riordan is the favorite for
the permanent chairmanship. There will
be a big fight for Street Superintendent,
the strongest candidates being Thomas
Desmond, J. P. Kincaid and George W.
Elder. A. C. Widber is a prominent can
didate for the mayoralty.
RAILROAD REPUBLICANS.
Over Four Hundred Employes
Listen to Tlrey Ford and
Colonel Robinson.
The Railroad Employes' Republican Club
met last night, over 400" strone, in Native
Sons' Hall, on Seventeenth street, near
Valencia, and listened to and enthusias
tically applauded vigorous speeches made
by ex-State Senator Tirey L. Ford, who
discussed at length the advantages of Re
publican rule, and Colonel John H. Rob
inson, fresh from a tour of the northern
part of the State, and filled with encour
agement over the outlook in that section
for McKinley and protection.
Music and song were introduced as a
variation to the exposition of Republican
doctrines, and to the evident approval of
more persons than the bevy of women in
t'-e gallery. There were solos by Messrs.
Mclntyre and Secretary W. C. Cook, who
also delivered an extemporaneous speech,
not on politics, but in a vein of good
humor particularly acceptable to his fel
low-employes, judging from their repeated
spontaneous applause. A quartet, consist
ing of IP. P. Mclntyre, C. P. Mclntyre, J.
J. Rose and M. Depue rounded out the
unpolitical part of the programme with a
sentimental selection appropriate to the
secretary's harm less witticism on the
woman suffragist and the new woman.
PROTECTION IS GAINING.
From North and South Alike
Comes News of Good
Cheer.
This evening at the Auditorium, corner
of Eddy and Jones streets, the McKinley
Invincible* will hold a mass-meeting.

gramme. Ella Ellis, the American "Vesta
Tilley," and the Sam Booth Glee Club
will appear in campaign songs. The gal

seats at all, should attend early.
Old Tuolumna.
Judge J. G. Swinnerton, who has been

for McKinley and protection.
Wage Earners.
At tbe meeting of the National Repub
lican League in Pioneer Hall this evening
General W. H. L. Barnes will address the
wage earners on the issues which are of
the most importance to them. A large at
tendance is expected. The Glee CluD will

ALL ARE SORELY GRIEVED
Rev. Dr. Colburn of Grace Meth
odist Episcopal Church
Is Dead.
Rev. Dr. M. F. Colburn, pastor of Grace
Methodist Episcopal Church, corner of
Capp and Twenty-first streets, is dead.
He was stricken down some time dur
ing Saturday night by paralysis of the
brain.
Sunday morning Dr. Hanson was called
and so critical did he consider the case
that he called into consultation with him
Dr. Henry Gibbons and Dr. Damkroger.
All day Sunday the stricken man's tem
perature remained as high as 104 degrees.
Shortly after midnight the patient recov
ered consciousness for a short time and
asked what bad happened to him and
again became unconscious.
Yesterday his temperature fell to 101
degrees and the anxious friends felt en
couraged, but last night it arose alarm
ingly, respiration became rapid and the
pulse faster and fainter. He died at 1:25
o'clock this niorninir.
TO AMPUTATS HIS LEGS.
Operation to Be Performed Upon "Monk"
Cuminlugft, the NÂ«wÂ»boy!
"Monk" CummingÃ, the crippled news
boy, who has been a familiar figure at
Powell and Mamet streets for two or
three years, will go to the French Hos
pital this morning to diet himself for an
operation to be performed on Saturday by
Dr. J. Albert Noble of the Emporium
building.
"Monk" is now 21 years of age. He was
born in the Northwest and while a baby
teething he was paralyzed in both legs
from the knees downward and his left
arm was also rendered a i most useless.
His parents died when he was a child.
Dr. Noble, whose office windows covered
the corner of Market and Powell streets,
has agreed to operate on the little fellow
gratuitously. The operation will be per
formed on Saturday, and it will be several
weeks before "Monk" will be able to re
sume business again, so that his friends
are not only anxious to raise enough
money to pay for his care at the hospital,
but to have something for him to start
afresh again.
TO EXAMINE DIVISION STAFF.
Governor Budd Names a Big; Board to
Perform That Duty.
Governor Budd has appointed the Di
vision Examining Board of the National
Guard of California. The officers who
will compose the board are: Brigadier-
General John H. Dickinson, retired;
Colonel W. P. Sullivan, retired, and
Colonel D. B. Fairbanks of the Fifth In
fantry.
These officers will have the duty im
posed upon them of examining the divi
sion staff for fitness for the positions
which they may be called upon to occupy.
The Division Examining Board as now
constituted is a permanent body. The
appointment by the Governor obviates
possible friction among the officers of tbe
National Guard.
Pleasure and Luxury.'
The pleasure and luxury ot a mud bath at
Paso Robles is greatly increased now since the
completion of the new bathing pavilion. All
the bathing arrangements are now on one
floor. Winter rates, $ 10, $12 50 and $15 per
week, now prevail at the hotel, and every
guest is privileged to enjoy all the different
PLATFORM OF THE
NON-PARTISANS
Adopted at Last Night's
Meeting of the Con
vention.
DEMANDS FOR REFORM.
Supervisors and Some Other City
Oificers Are Roundly
Scored.
FREE TELEPHONES AND GAB.
Commendation of the Local Wheelmen
for Asking Good Pavements
acd Streets.
Frospect Hall, in the Odd Fellows'
building, was rather thinly populated at
last night's session of the Non-partisan
convention, but what the assembly lacked
in numbers was amply made up in en
thusiasm.
The chief business of the meeting was
the adoption of a party platform. George
K. Fitch presided.
The platform prepared was read
by Mr. Sullivan. It is a
long document and promises great
things. It demands clean streets and
clean municipal government, scores
Supervisors, the "push" ana the politico
religious combinations, and favors a
dollar-limit tax on a $300,000,000 â¢ valua
tion.
The County Clerk is denounced, and
free gas, water, light and telephone ser
vice are some of the things to which tax
paying citizens are said to be entitled. A
protest is entered against the Lmli fees al
lowed to stenographic court reporters, it
being claimed that $5 a day or 73 2 ' cents a
folio would be amply sufficient.
The action of the local wheelmen in
demanding good streets is warmly com
mended, and the position is taken that in
no case should the Superintendent of
Streets be other than a practical engineer.
Tbe new charter is indorsed with many
phrases of approval. Tbe reckless ex
penditure of public funds is roundly
scored, and a hope expreseed that tbe
Southern Pacific Company's indebtedness
may be paid in full like any other debt.
George Cumming bad an objection to
offer to the platform.
"It cannot be of any use to crush out
the spoils system," he contended, "unless
it provides for a good elective system.
Supervisors oueht to be elected by the
oeople of the wards which they repre
sent."
Ex-Mayor Ellert deprecated the caustic
references in the pla'.form to Assessor
Siebe. This caused quite a little discus
sion.
But the wordy wrangle of the evening
was between Messrs. Sullivan and Le Bre
ton as to a provision in tbe platform call
ins for a fearless District Attorney. Mr.
Sullivan in particular waxed eloquent.
'â¢It is not enough,'' he cried, "for a Dis
trict Attorney to be young and courteous
and popular; he must be ready whenever
it may be his duty to proceed against all
persons guilty of malfeasance in office nnd
get them over to San Quentin if they de
serve it."
Mr. Le Breton at length made it clear
that he had intended only to criticise the
wording of the section and quiet was par
tially restored.
Mr. Sullivan, however, broke out afresh
when a mention of the Assessor was
made.
"He ought to have gone to Sacra
mento," he said, "and made his report to
the State Board of Equalization, it was
his duty, and he neglected to perform it."
Mr. Ellert rejoined that the Assessor
was not obliged to present nimself before
the Board of Equalization, and should
not be censured for not doing a thing
which the law did not compel him to do.
Several others spoke warmly in favor of
Mr. Siebe, stating that the Merchants'
Association and other friends of the City
had advised him not to go to Sacramento.
The offending reference was stricken
out, and tbe platform as amended was
unanimously adopted.
But barely had the platform been
adopted when the members iell to picking
it to pieces.
"The Supervisors ought not to be de
nounced as a whole,'' remarked Mr. El
lert. "It would be better to limit our
condemnation to the "Solid Eight."
Mr. Truman offered a resolution refer
ring the section back to the committee on
platform and resolutions for revision, but
after much discussion the resolution was
tabled.
The committee on place of meeting re
ported that the hall of the Academy of
Sciences seemed in their judgment both
central and commodious.
The following committees were then ap
pointed by the chair:
On judiciaryâ Henley, Ellert, Jacobs, Root,
Sullivan, Ziegler, Halladie, Smith, Capp and
Gregory.
On municipal affairsâ Le Breton, Cumming
Harris. Whiting, Davis, Berteling, Burr, Zeile
and Swain.
On Supervisorsâ Ellert, Capp, Ashton,
Lynch, Bherwood, Payne, Truman, Menzies,
Altscbul and Sbarboro.
On educationâ Sherwood, Perkins, Halladie,
Bonestell, Lynch. Milliken, Whiting, Deneke,
Romaine and Coll.
On priutiugâ Towns, Well and Smith.
Literacy committee â Lynch, Hallidie, Per
kius, Paine, Samuels and Webster.
Mr. Le Breton caused general consterna
tion by making a motion that the mem
bers be assessed $20 a head for campaign
expenses. The amount was at length
reduced to $10, and it being put to a vote,
all promised to subscribe that sum.
The longest discussion of the evening
was as to tbe time of the next meeting,
cries of "Wednesday," "Thursday" and
"Friday" alternating with confusing
reiteration. Wednesday was at last de
clared the winner, the place to be the lec
ture ball o; the Academy of Sciences.
POPULISTS ARE CONFUSED
Dr. J. L. York's Advocacy of
Socialism Calls Forth
Round Cheers.
As usual the municipal convention of
the Populists was held at tne People's
party tent last nignt. But something that
was not usual happened. There came
very near being war over the fu
sion proposition and one delegate
went so far as to say that Populists
were making themselves ridiculous by
letting the Democrats have things all
their own way. Verbal oil was poured
upon the troubled political waters in time
to avoid any disruption ot the assemblage,

but everybody breathed freer when tbe
crisis was past.
After the rollcall the committee on cre
dentials gave notice that Robert Miles had
been substituted as a delegate to the con
vention from the Thirty-first District in
place of Dr. J. L. York and Dr. C. B.
Cleveland from the Thirty-ninth in place
of W. B. Dunlap.
The following delegates from the Forty
fourth were seated : Joseph L. Kehrlein,
M. A. Brown. B. J. Pye, J. K. Ross, H. J.
Wilson, M. J. Hearney, A. A. Ross, John
Keane and Robert Hamilton.
Hon. T. V. Cator was then called to the
platform amid the plaudits of the assem
blage and made a very eloquent speech.
At the conclusion of his remarks Cator
was loudly applauded.
Hon. Taylor Rogers, chairman of the
committee on platform, then read the re
portof that committee.
"We have made this enunciation of
principles remarkably brief," he began,
"and if adopted and put into operation it
will completely make useless the verbose
new charter." The platform is as follows :
PEOPLE'S PARTY PLATFORM FOR SAN FRANCISCO,
1896.
We indorse our State and National platforms
and favor the following propositions: First,
direct legislation by the people. Second, such
amendment cf the State constitution as
will permit home rule in taxation and
local government. Third, municipal owner
ship of water, light, street cars pub
lic markets and other public utilities.
Fourth, instead of "soup-houses," the Detroit
or Xew Zealand plans for the unemployed.
Fifth, the Guernsey market plan for public
improvements. Sixth, abolition of the fran
chise and special privilege system. Seventh,
day labor in place of our piesent contract
system on public works. Eighth, includingthe
kindergartens in our public school system.
Ninth, smooth, substantial streets and scien
tific sewerage. Tenth, all officials to be paid
according to their labor. Eleventh, a full- paid
Fire Department. Twelfth, the condemnation
of all efforts to divide the people by their re
ligious views.
Respectfully submitted September 21, 1896.
Taylor Rogers. Chairman of Committee.
H. W. Fletcher, Secretary.
J. M. Caster took exception to the clause
regarding religion, stating that both Na
tional and State constitutions guaranteed

Dr. J. L. York and j. H. Tingman made
laudatory speeches on tbe platform, de
claring it a gem and perfect as it stood.
On being put to a vote it was adopted
unanimously amid uproarious enthu
siasm.
Joseph Asbury Johnson, on behalf of
tbe conference committee, stated that so
far nothing definite had been done in re
gard to a fusion with either wing of tbe
Democrats. He had found, however, that
nowhere was the People's party regarded
as an unimportant factor. He asked that
the committee be continued till the next
meeting.
After a deal of warm discussion, pro
and con, Chairman Daywalt ruled that
nominations were out of order till ihe re
ports of the conference and resolutions
committees were heard. These had been
laid over till next meeting, hence nomina
tions were by this ruling deferred till
then.
Dr. J. L. York was then called to the
stand and made a very soothing and moli
fying speech, aimed especially at those
delegates who wanted the convention to
rise in its might and electrify the City by
making nominations.
York then proceeded to say that at
heart he was a socialist, and thought
every other man was, too. As usual, the
audience applauded, but as it began to
dawn upon them that this was
heretical doctrine they ''looked one at the
other and 'gan to counsel among them
selves."
Then after another brief speech by
George D. Gillespie the convention ad
journed till Thursday evening at 8.
Willing to Pay Up
The case of C. F. Schadt, district organiser
tor the Carpenters' and Joiners' Union, charged
with embezzling $63 35, which was given him
to organize branches, was called in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday. Schadt claimed
that he had been held up and robbed of the
money and expressed his willingness to repay
it if granted time. The Judge continued the
case for a week on that understanding.
It is estimated that from 40,000 to 50,000
slaves are yearly carried away captive
from Zanzibar and the neighboring ports.

GARRET A. HOB ART, of Hew Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER S. 1896.
McKinley stands for good wages.
What did Bryan ever do for the work
ingman?
Republican protection has never failed
to establish prosperity.
Panic and disaster have never failed to
follow Democratic free trade.
No workingman will forget that he was
prosperous under the McKinley tariff.
International bimetallism will win be
cause the people know it to be a safe thing
and will make it a sure thing.
Tbe need of American industry is se
curity, and Bryan threatens it with a
greater disturbance than ever before.
The Democrats and the Populists know
their principles cannot be harmonized,
but they have great hopes of agreeing on
a division of the spoils.
McKinley was right in saying, "This is
a year ot political contention without bit
terness, 1 ' but all the same there is a great
deal of gall in evidence on the Democratic
side.
The Republican pledge to promote the
free coinage of silver by international
agreement is one of the issues of the cam
paign tne Popocrats shy at about as much
as they do at the tariff issue.
Hoke Smith will support Bryan but op
pose his platform, thus justifying the
nickname of Hocus Pocus and proving
himself one of the smiths who can do all
kinds of turning and twisting.
As the Popocrat organs insist that the
pledge for bimetallism in the Republican
plattorm means gold, it is perfectly clear
that they desire Mexican silver moio
rnetahisni without any gold at all.
McKinley stands for protection to the
industries of America, while Bryan favors
givins European and Oriental labor a free
chance in the American market, no matter
what happens to the American working
man.
It is not surprising that the Inter
national Agricultural Congress at Buda-
Pesth should send telegrams of encourage
ment to Bryan. Those European fellows
wish our cold and are willing that we
should have silver.
Thi Call stands up for silver as do all
tbe stalwart Republican bimptallists of
the country, but we do not intend to per
mit it to be tised by silver monometal lists
as a decoy to deceive the- people into
voting for tbe free-traders, the sectionalists
and the demagogues of the Popocrat
fusion.
After all their weeks ot preparation and
all their plans and combinations the
Democrats of New York muddled the
whole thing by putting a eoldbug candi
date for Governor on a free-silver platform,
and now they will have to go through the
campaign straddling the barbed-wire
fence as best they can. â 
The country is opposed equally to
Palmer's gold monometallism and to
Bryan's silver monometallism. In fact
Democracy has got wrong with both feet.
The peop c favor gold and silver. They
desire a bimetallic system of money and
will support the Republican party as
earnestly on that ground an on the Issue I
of restoring protection and reciprocity.
The campaign of education has made it
clear to the people that Bryan's scheme of
free silver would reduce the purchasing
power of money, and thereby be equivalent
to an arbitrary reduction of the wages of
every workingman in the country as well
as a loss to ail who have money in the
banks or insurance policies. For this
reason sensible peopie will have none of
it. They intend to have good money in
the future as in the past.
One of tne most -a: isfactory features of
tliis campaign is the number of stal wart
Democrats who have announced a deter
mination to vote directly for McKinley as
a means of crushing out Bryanism and all
that it stands for in our politics. In the
action of these mpn we see a clear evi
dence that patriotism among our people is j
superior to party spirit, and that there is
no danger of demagogues getting control
of the Government in this country.
Prince Bismarck is quoted as saying re
cently, "1 hold that this is the very hour
that would be advisable to bring about a
mutual agreement in favor of bimetal
lism," and as such an agreement is the
very thing the Republican party is pledged
to promote the earnest advocate of the
free coinage of silver can see how foolish
it would be at this time to throw away the
chance of international bimetallism for
the sake of making a recKless experiment
with Democratic silver luonometalliÃin.
THE POLITICAL DUTY OF CALI
FORNIANS.
The greatness of a State depends upon
the will, tbe energy and tbe industry of
its citizens. Unless a people are deter
mined to make a great commonwealth
they will never upbuild one. These things
are Iruisms. Every intelligent man
knows thorn. It follows as a consequence
that every man who wishes to see Califor
nia become a ereat State must work for
that object. He must support that party
whose political purposes move to noble
ends rather than one which exists only
for the discontented and the envious.
You who are Californians are well aware
of the great possibilities of the State.
You know that in the production oi raw
material it is excessively rich. You know
that in the industry ana ambition of its
people it is perhaps superior to any
similar territory on earth. You know
that it has been blessed by nature above
all other lands. You know that its politi
cal and social organization place it in the
front rank of American communities.
You know that with a resolute and well
directed effort on the part of its people
California may be made the scene of the
highest civilization known to history.
This being so, it is clearly your duty to
help forward that work. You owe it to
youiself and your neighbor to promote
not only your own industry, but his also.
You serve your State and your country
when you serve yourself and your fellow
man. Intelligent self-interest and patriot
ism are identical.
In this campaign it is not difficult for
you to determine which party to join,
what ticket to vote for. You who are
wool-growers know what free trade has
done for the wool industry. You who are
fruit-growers know how the reduction of
the tariff has reduced your income. You
who are grain-growers Know what has
been the effect of breaking down tbe home
market for home products. You who are
wage-earners know how low wages have
fallen since protection was set aside.
These things which concern your own in
dustry, trade, business and wages you
Know, whether you are Republicans, Demo
crats. Populists or Prohibitionists. Know
ing them, it depends on your own will how
you shall act. Will you vote for your own
interest and help your neighbor to build
up the State, or vote against your own
interest to spite your neighbor, at the ex
pense of the State?
It was said of old by Cicero, "Man never
works so godlike as in the building of a
nation." Surely every patriotic man
would like to take part and do a loyal
share in the subiime work of upbuilding
the American Nation and the mighty civ
ilization that is to be on the Pacific Coast.
You can each and all of you take a part in
that work. Though you may have no di
rect profit from a particular enterprise,
you can help to build it up by voting to
give it adequate protection. Though
your efforts may not be widely known,
yoa can none the Jess be a heluer in ad
vancing every Californian industry irom
the growing of delicate fruits to the con
struction of iron warships. The choice is
before you. The issue is in your hands.
He who tampers with the currency robs
labor of its bread. He panders, inaeed, to
greedy capital, which is keen- sighted and
may thift for itself, but he beggars labor,
which is honstly unsuspecting and 100 busy
with the present to calculate for the future.
The prosperity of the working classes lives,
moves and has its being in established credit
and a steady medium of payment. All
sudden change* disturb it- â Daniel Webster.
FOR BREAD AND BUTTER.
The vrorkingmen of this country are be
ginning to realize ibat the main issue in
this campaign is one of bread and butter
rather tnan of forms of money. Mr.
Bryan's admission that "we would, no
doubt, have a panic at first after the adop
tion of free coinage" has set wage-earners
to wondering how free coinage could
inaugurate a panic if free coinage is
what is needed to advance prices and
make go d times, ana well may they
wonder. Not a few working people es
poused Bryan's free silver scheme when it
was new and fresh, but the logical argu
ments of the advocates of true bimetal
lism, together with their own sober sec
ond thought, have convinced them that
bread and butter is not to be had by tbe
operation of a policy that its defenders
admit would start in by causing a busi
ness panic.
Wage-earners, especially those employed
by manufacturing enterprises, are begin
ning to understand the full import of
Bryan's declaration in Congress, that "A
tariff of 10 per cent levied purposely for
protection was just as indefensible as
tariff for a 1000 per cent." They now know
that Bryan stands for absolute free trade
under any and all circumstances, and
tney now know, too, that such a policy
would mean the surrender of all our goods
and wares markets to foreign cheap labor.
Hence it is that workingtuen are making
this a bread-and-butter rather than a free
trade and free^ilver campaign. They now
quite agree with Major McKinley that
wba; is wanted is not opÂ«n mints for the
unlimited coinage cf the silver of the
world, but open mills for the full and un
restricted labor of American workingmen.
Wage-earners now understand that it is
free trade and not protection that makes
crowns of tborns to press tne brow of
labor, and that next to silver monometal
lism Mr. Bryan regards free trade as the
most essential thing for them. They are
beginning to understand, too, tbat Bryan's
election would mean still greater indus
trial stagnation and a larger number of
idle wortcini/men. All these things work
ingmen understand, and it would be a re
flection upon their intelligence to say that
the question of bread and butter dues not
concern them. Tula is labor's campaign
for plenty of work and good wages.
/ hold this disturbance of the measure of
value and the means of payment and ex
change â this derangement and, if I may so
say, this violation of the currency â to be one
of the most unpardonable of political faults. â
Daniel Webster.
BISMARCK AND BIMETALLISM
The Examiner tries very hard to twist
Bismarck's letter to Governor Culberson
of Texas into a meaning far different from
what it was intended to convey. Bis
marck simply said to Governor Culberson
what he hat been saying for years: that
the nations should adoot a bimetallic
monetary system; but never has he nor
does he now advocate independent action
by his Government. It is true Bismarck
says if ibis country should find It compat
ible with its interests to take independent
actionâ that is, to assume the responsibil
ity and risk the danger of such independ
ent actionâ it might exert a salutary influ
ence upon the consummation of an inter
national agreement, but the meaning of
what he says is that no good would accrue
to a nation adopting bimetallism unless it
was joined by the other nations. Prince
Bismarck is in complete harmony with
the Republican party as far as that goes.
It is true beyond the possibility of
doubt that Germany and other Euro
pean nations would like to see the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1896.
United States take independent action,
or rather try the experiment of such
action, so mat if it failed Europe
would be very much less disturbed
than if its own nations should undertake
it and fail. Bismarck knows, as does every
other economist, that independent action
on the part of this country would place
the United States iv the position of leader
without any positive assurance of a fol
lowing, which would injure our commerce
very materially while the question of an
international conference was pending; be
sides, it would put other nations in a posi
tion to demand much of us and make ac
quiescence contingent upon granting us
commercial advantages. Bismarck is a
professional diplomat, and it is Germany's
interests that he wants to promote first,
last and all the time.
These things tbe leaders of the Republi
can party understand quite as well as Bis
marck does, and therefore they propose to
have the nations move in concert in the
matter of establishing a bimetallic mone
tary system, so that tbe United States
would not be left to "hold the bag," so to
speak, if the purpose failed. Bismarck
knows very well that while we were taking
independent action our gold would leave
us and that Germany would get its full
share of it, but be is so guarded in ex
pressing his opinion, or rather in giving
advice, that he uses the diplomatic loop
hole "compatible with the United States'
interests." Bismarck is, as we hava said,
a bimetallism and he is on record in many
places as expressing the belief that no na
tion could afford to undertake it alone,
but he is perfectly willine that the United
States should make the experiment, for
whether we failed or not Germany would
be the gainer. . This country wants bimet
allism, and so do the countries of Europe,
but if there are any chestnuts in this bi
metallic fire the United States will not be
the nation to pull them out to save Eu
rope's fingers.
Honest industry never comes in for any part
of the spoils in the scramble which takes place
when the currency of a country is disordered.
Did wild schemes and projects ever benefit the
industrious? Did violent fluctuations ever do
good to him who depends on his daily labor
for his daily bread f Certainly never. All
these things may gratify greediness for sudden
gain or the rashness of daring speculation,
but they can bring nothing but injury and
distress to the homes of patient industry and
honest labor.â Daniel Webster.
THE TIFTH ARTILLERY.
The orders received by the Fifth Artil
lery to make immediate preparations to
leave this City as soon after October 1 as
practicable are of interest to the general
public It is strange that no explanation
has been given from headquarters of the
cause for this sudden and unexpected
change. It is certainly an unwise move
to transfer men from tbe climate of San
Francisco to that of the extreme Southern
states at this season of t c year and such
a movement should not be maae without
important and pressing reason*.
General Miles is now in the West, and
may be in San Francisco oefore the week
is over. It is to be hoped he will arrive
early enough to review the situation be
fore the regiment is removed. The Fifth
has served in tbe Southern States since
other artillery regiments, and ahould not
be called upon again for that duty until
those others have served their turn. There
may be no favoritism back of the orders,
but there is a suspicion of it, and for that
reason tbe public will be eager to have the
whole history of the movement made
clear.
As it is not usual to send regiments from
Northern States to the South at. this season
of the year, the order is the more remark
able inasmuch as it requires the regiment
to be prepared to move practically at
once. Why should there be suoh a rush
wnen there is no apparent reason for it?
Why could not the removal have been
made as is customary at a later and cooler
season of the year? There are many and
good reasons why the Fifth should remain
in San Francisco, but we know of none
why it should be removed.
The laboring men matted together are the
great market which absorbs the production of
the United States, and they keep themselves at
work. Now a great many of them want other
workmen kept out, and yet they do not teem
to see that whenever a bale of goods lands
here, which is the result of labor abroad,
there it just so much foreign labor landed
here and doing its work. â Tom Reed.
NATURAL ECONOMIC PACTS.
A recent issne of the New York Journal,
which is owned by the proprietor
of the Pan Francisco Examiner, who
is the owner of $6,000,000 of silver
mining stock, revels in this kind of
fallacious reasoning, glaring contradic
tions and illogical conclusions to inveigle
the people into electing Bryan so as to
double tbe value ol his silver mines:
Under free coinage the United States Gov
ernment would establish a fixed and unlim
ited demand for Hirer at a price of $1 29 par
ounce, payable in silver dollars. The man
who took to the mint 371% grains of pure sli
ver would get a silver dollar. The supply of
silver is fixed by nature, not by man's activ
ities, and the increased demand, an absolutely
unlimited demand made by a great and always
solvent purchaser, would instantly raise the
price of the bullion to the mint price.
It is very true, as the Journal says, any
one could, if silver coinage were free and
unlimited, take 371}^ grains of fine silver,
and have them converted into a disk witn
"one dollar stamped upon it; but that
would no more fix the price of silver bullion
in the merchandise market than would the
conversion of wheat into flour by the
miller fix the price of wheat in the grain
market. Tbe point that the Journal
makes, whether purposely to mislead and
deceive or through ignorance, is that
under free and unlimited silver coinage
the Government would practically be the
.purchaser of offerings of tbe raw material,
and thus double tbe market price of
bullion, and arbitrarily maintain that
price in the metal market.
Under free coinage the Government
could not, even the Journal - Examiner
editor and proprietor should know, be a
purchaser of the metal if it would, and
hence tnere could be no "mint price." To
make a price for an artic c there must be
a seller and a buyer, but free coinage pro
vides for neither, hence there could be no
such thing as a Government price for sil
ver.
During and for some years prior to 1873
nature did not supply quite enough to
meet the demand, and consequently the
market price of 371VS grains of pure silver
ranged as high as 104 cents, but immedi
ately thereafter nature grew so liberal with
her supply that the demand could not
consume it all, and so the market price
of 371 Y% crams, including the product
of the Journal - Examiner's mines, went
down to about 50 cents. Prior to 1873
when the mints were open to tbe free
coinage of silver, the "mint price" exerted
no influence upon the commercial price ot
silver. Had it exerted any influence 371%
graiue of silver would not have been
worth above nor below the value of 100
cents; but as a matter of fact silver bul
lion had commercial value of more than
100 cents lot 371% grains from 1834 until
nature furnished a greater supply than
commerce wanted at that price.
The Journal-Examiner's $6,000,000 of sil
ver mining stock appears to have
blinded the combined eyes to some
very important natural economic facts.
But of course the Journal-Examiner's
editor and proprietor, who is also the
owner of silver mining property worth
96,000,000, is not demanding that the
mints be opened so as to double the price
of silver. It is patriotismâ patriotism
with a silver lining.

SOME SUNDAY NEWSPAPER
ABOMINATIONS.
Ban Diego Tribune.
The Call prints the handsomest and most
attractively made up Sunday edition of any of
the San Francisco dailies. The matter is un
usually Interesting, and the general arrange
ment decidedly srtisti*. However, these
| gigantic Sunday papers are a positive nui
sance. Nobody thanks the publisher tor them;
they are rarely half read, and prove a mere
embarrassment of riches to subscribers. They
have grown to such unwieldy proportions out
i of a small spirit of rivalry, and the paper thnt
I will have the courage to return to cot more
than sixteen pages of carefully selected matter
will confer a boon on its readers, and receive
merited praise for dariug to abandon an abom
inable custom, which will be vastly more hon
ored in the breach than in the observance.
We suggest to Thk Call to pioneer the pro
posed reform. It could make a sixteen-page
paper without padding that everybody would
admire and enjoy.
THE MOST POPULAR SKIRT.
New skirts are cut with two gores In the
back, which form box-pleats. The one shown
here has in all seven gores, the two side gores
flowing wide at the foot and close-fitted over
the hips. The great advantage gained by two
side gores is the permanent good shape, for
these gores do not stretch out of shape, as a
wider and necessarily more bias gore would.
All fabrics are cut in this way, and the side
gores are usually cut itralght at the front edge.
but if striped goods are used they may be cut
straight througn the center, thus lining the
edges both bias and making the stripes meet at
the seams. The back gores are cut with the
straight thread through the center in any case.
Black satin Is still as much used at any
other fabric for skins to be worn with fancy
blouse waists or coat ba>ques for full dress
occasions. The only stiffening now used is a
band of haircloth about six inches wide at the
loot, and even this is omitted in manyokirta
the flare depending on the proper cut and on
the body of the silk used for linii,*.
Drcbdf n silks are much used for separate
skirts, and recommend themselves because
two or three different colors will generally
harmonize with them, and so a great vnriutv
in waist is possible. One of brown, with black
satin threads, the flowers being indefinite
tones of violet, had a brown velvet' coat
basque, a black eatin waist and a waist of
violet chiffon trimmed with sable for evening
wear. â¢
Dresses of wools, such as cheviot, tweed
st-rges and cloth, have skirts cut after this
model, with neat-fitted waists untrimmed for
general wear, or trimmed with velvet, Dresden
silk, ribbons, lace or spangled bands for after
noon or evening wear.

AROUND THE C ORRIDORS.
Among the arrivals at the Occidental Hotel
is F. Temple Lynch of England. Mr. Lynch"
became interested a few years ago tn coffee en
terprises in Guatemala. He has not, however,
been there for six years. Only six weeks ago
he returned here from England and has since
been up among the redwoods of Humboldt
County.
Mr. Lynch traveled about considerably in
the timber country and visited several of the
mills and the heaviest timber districts.
"There is an enormous amount of timber up
there," said the gentleman yesterday. Â«'The
F. Temple Lynch, the English Cap
italist, Who Has Been Surprised
at the Extent of the Redwoods.
[Sketched from life by a " Call" artUL]
trees in some districts are enormous â they are
simply a surprise. There is a new mill about
completed at Scotia. Scotia is about the cen
ter of tbe heaviest lumber district. The mill
is to start up before long.
"In general over Humboldt Courty, how
ever, it Is pretty dull In the lumbering busi
ness. There has been lif tie demand for lumber
for a good while. One mill there has been
idle so long that It is nearly falling to pieces.
I went out on a little railroad they have there,
, tbe Â£el River Railroad, which penetrates the
lumber districts. On every band were the
â enormous redwood trees.
"The people there expect that after the elec
tion there will be something of a new deal and
that times will begin to improve, making a de
mand lor lumber once more, then the mills
will all start up again. "
STRENGTH OF THE COLORED VOTE
BÂ»n Francisco Vindicator.
In a due consideration of the status of the
colored vote of California at the approaching J
election the only way to approach truth is to |
Consult reliablo statistics in order to arrive at
an accurate conclusion. According to the
census of the United States iv 1890, as pub
lished in the New York World Almanac for
1896, the colored vote of California was at
that time 72,001; that is to say California
stood tenth among all the States of the Union
in the numerical value of its colored vote.
Thus Georgia heads the list with 179,028;
next comes Mississippi, with 150,409; third,
Alabama, with 140,703; fourth, South Caro
lina, with 13^,949; fifth. Virginia, with 130.
-747; sixth, Louisiuna, with 119,815; teventh,
North Carolina, with 109,346; eighth, Texas, j
with 101,98*2; niuth, Tennessee, with9'2,462;
tenth, Caliioruia, witn 72.0U1.
The next largest vote belong* to Arkansas,
Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and Florida, in
their order, the votts of the two latter states
being nearly a tie, at a trine ever 38,999, or
only a little more '.nan hall of the colored vote
of Calliurnia. Looking at the matter from an
other point of view the same authority, com
piled from the Reports of the Census ot 1890,
give the total voting population of California j
as 402,289, of which 390,2'itJ were whites and
72,001 colored. In other words, the ratio of
the colored to the white vote sto<>d considera- ;
bly above 1 to 0 and very nearly 2 to 11 at that
time. Doubt. ess the admis ion oi native sons
to the ballot during the past six years, to
gether with immigation, has still further
widened the ratio between the white aud col
ored vote; still the ratio must yet be in the
near neighborhood oi 6 to 1.
Our object in producing these statistics at
the present juncture is to let our colored
brethren understand that they far outclass in
the matter of votes either tne German or the
Irish, or, for that matter, both of the national
ities combin-d. If they make up their minds
to stand together at the coming election they
can not only dictate terms but get an honor
able share Of the loaves and fishes, which
they have never yet dÂ»ne, for want of unity
of action.
It will certainly be a surprise, and a very
great one, too, to the bulk of the people of
this State that the colored vote of California
should reacii the abnormal figure of 72,000
when the eutie colored population is rated at
a little over 96.000.
Why is it that the normal 5 to 1 ratio of
population to voters does not hold good with
tha colored race as with others? The explan
ation is to be found in the fact that of recent
years there has been an immense influx, run
ning up into the thousands, of young unmar
ried colored men in Central and Southern
California, so that the ratio of colored males
to colored females in out of all proportion,
while the absence of chi.dren further tends to
lessen the ratio of population as compared
with vote. Without this explanation the
ligures would seem apocryphal and unworthy
of credence. They have, rmw.-ver, the au
thority of the census records of 1890, as re
produced in the World Almanac, and cannot
be gainsaid.
THE WORKINGMAN NOT EASILY
FOOLED.
Rochester Post-Kxpreas.
In his Chicago speech Bryan quoted ap
provingly Lincoln's remark that "no men are
more worthy to be trusted than those who toil
up from poverty." But the burden oi Bryan's
talk is that just as soon as a man has toiled up
and left poverty behind him he is not to be
trusted, but U to be regarded with suspicion
by those ctlll struggling below. The American
workiiigman is not easily fooled. He must
have- taken the measure of Brvan before t..is.
It must have occurred tn him Hint a candidate
who, while professing ardent affection for the
poor man, is nevertheless bnekiiig a little
pcherue, which, If it went through, would do
the wage-earners out of half tbeir wages, is
not to be taken seriously, is not a mau to take
as a guide. _______^^__^
A NEW STORY ABOUT WEBSTER.
Boston Evening Transcript.
Here is an anecdote ot Daniel Webster that
has never been in print:
Webster was once sued 'by his meat man.
The man did not call upon Webster afterward
to trade with him. Webster met him in tbe
course of a few days and asked him why he
Uidn't call. "Because." said the man, "I sup
posed that you would be offended and wouldn't
trade with me any more." To which Webster
replied: "Oh, hue me as many times as you
like, but for heaven's sake don't starve me to
death."
GOLD FOR T HE SILVER CAMPAIGN
Jackson (Atnador County) Ledger.
The 600 employes of the Utica mine have
been presented with a little paper to sign
which pledges them to put up $10 for a cam
paign fund, to be kept out ot their wages at the
rate of a little over $3 per month for three
months. This paper came from headquarters,
through C. D. Lave, one of the owoers of the
mine and a lifelong Democrat and a Bryan ad
vocate. Some of the employes demurred at
the proposition, which came in the form of a
voluntary contribution, and were on the point
I of refusing to give up $10 of their hard-earned
money for campaign purposes, and so stated
to one of the clerks wno is very close to the
owners of the mine. The answer was, "You
had better stand it." A few of ihÂ» employes
refused to ?ive up tho $10. and now are ex
pecting to "be discharged when next payday
comes.
THE REASON WHY.
The San Francisco Wasp.
The call was the object of a bitter attack by
the Examiner this week. Ostensibly silver
was the cause. In reality, circulation was the
reason. Thk Call is steadily climbing up in
popularity and cutting deep Into the Exam
iner. Why? Simply because it is an honest,
Clean, straightforward paper, which avoids
disgusting stnsationalism and gives the news,
the whole news and nothing but tne news, in
plain, matter-of-fact and truthful style every
day. Such a policy will win out every time,
and The Call is winning. Go into the public
resorts of the City and see how it is read and
called for.
EPIGRAMMATIC WISDOM.
Terse Saying;* From Speaker Reed's
Portland Speech.
I think we had better convert the heathen
and not join them.
Great as our nation is, we cannot make some
thing out of nothing.
It is good sense to recognize that a stone wall
is a stone wall when it is in front of us.
There is but one thing for an individual, a
firm, corporation or nation to do, and that is
to be honest.
Human nature in the United Btates is verr
much the same from time to time, except that
it grows steadily better.
Which would you prefer, an unlimited check
up Â«n the rainbow bank of promise or a certi
ficate for what is exactly due on the bank of
experience?
Men with vivid imaginations and with a cer
tain lack of fixity of principles have invited
us many times into flowery paths of dishonor
and we have never yet followed them.
When a nation wants to borrow money it is
almost always because Its life is at stake, and
nothing stands a nation in stead like the
honorable fulfillment of every obligation en
tered into.
The experience of the world has proved to
us beyond preadventure that the attempt to is
sue Government money every time a specula
tive period has set in and burst means de
struction and ruin out of which there is no
way except through bankruptcy.
RETAILING BORROWED META
PHORS.
Philadelphia Record.
Mr. Bryan quotes with approval the advice
of Cicero to his son: "Don't go into retail busi
ness; it is small and vulgar business." Yet
Candidate Bryan's whole business during tne
progress of the campaign has been the retail
ing of small and scrappy aphorisms. He hasn't
dealt with any large principle in a wholesale
way.

The Night Taper Burnsâ B., City. Several
friends of Answers to Correspondents, 8.1. H.,
D. C. V., Mrs Q. C. and C. W. 8., have fur
nished the verse : from which the quotation
about the night taper appears. It Is an anony
mous hymn and appears in Congregational,
Presbyterian and Catholic books uuder the
title of "Fading, Still Fading." It is also to be
ionnd in "Hong Greeting of High Schools"
and in "The World's Sweetest Songs."
The quotation asked for is to be found in the
second verse. One version in "Carmina Sacra"
is as follows:
Father in heaven, hear when we call:
Hear us for Christ's sake, who is savior of all.
Feeble and fainting, we trust In thy might:
In doubt and in darkness thy love be our light!
Let an sleep In thy arms . while the night taper
-â  burns, â 
Wake in thy love when the morning returns.
i Father, have mercy Father, have mercy 1
I Father, have mercy! through Jesus Christ, our
Lord.
Another version in "Songs of the Sanctuary"
has it: .;
Let us sleep on tby breast while the night taper
â -â¢: â¢â¢ burns. â -â¢.-â .'â  Â»â¢' 'â 
And wake in thy arms when morning returns.
And closes with "Amen" after 'Through
Jesus Christ our Lord." The Catholic ver
sion is: , â  . '
Aye Maria, oh, hear when we cull,
Mother of him who is savior ot all. '
Feeble an.' fearing, wo fly to th â  might '.
Id doubting and darkness, thy love be our light.
Let us sleep on thy breast while the night taper
burns, r
And wake In thy arms when tho morning returns.
Aye Maria, Aye Maria, Aye Maria, audinos.
This is an imploration to the Virgin Mary
for her protection, and is taught In the Sun
day-schools of the Catholic church.
Curlicueâ D., City. Curlique, formerly car
licue, is an Americanism which is to be found
in the modern dictionaries. The Century says
that it is sometimes written curlique and that
it is an allusion to the curly Q, or the capliel
lettÂ«r Q when written in the form of the figure
2. Another definition it gives is that the word
Highest of all in Leavening Power.â Latest U. S. Gov't Report
R^j%! Baking
' ABSOLUTELY PURE :
means something fantnstlcally curitrt or
twisted, as to make a curlicue with a pen, or
cut a curlicue while-skating on the ice. :
Murray's, the. latest English dictionary now
in course of publication in parts, ,says:
"Curlicue, a fantastic curl or twist ; to cht up
curlicues, in the United States is commoa for
to cut up capers."
Maitland in his dictionary of American
slang says that the word means a fanttstic
ornament.
Barrere, in "Slang, Jamm and Cant," sars
that the word is an Americanism and thatÂ«he
old words carle-cat or curli-cat, a male cÂ«t or
kitten, may have influenced the formatioi of
curlicues. . â
Bartlett, in "Dictionary of Amertcanisas,
says the word means boy ; sh tricks, and that to
cut up carlicucs is to cut up capers. He says
it is made up from curly an'i cue, or perhaps a
corruption of the French carcarole or tne Span
ish carcarol; or comparatively cavort, a trans
position made from cuvert.
"Sailv," says I, "will you take me for better oi
for worse?"
This put her to considering, and Igavea nouriih
Ing about the room and cut a curly cue with mv
rlcht foot, as much as to say, 'Take your own
time."â McCllmock's Tales
"lt Is generally supposed that nature Is perfec
tion In all her works, except when she gets odd
freaks In her head and cuts up carlicues by way
of experiment." â Dow's bernions, vol. 111,48.
Pent Up Utica-G. F. H., City. The follow
ing at the head of the Californian:
No pent-up Utica contracts our powers.
But the whole unbounded continent U ours.
Was stolen and altered from Jonathan M.
Sewall, one of the earliest American poets,
who lived from 1748 to 1808. His lines were:
No pent-up Utica contracts your powers,
But the w holt- boundless continent is yours.
The lines by Sewall occur in an epilogue he
wrote lor the trajiedv of "Cato," by Joseph
AddiÃon, a famous English essayist and dram
atis t, when the play was produced in the Bow
street Theater, in Portsmouth, N. H., 1778.
The lines piaced at the head of the Californian
had reference to the great opportunities open
ing before the newly acquired American terri
tory. To be better understood it may be well to
give some idea upon which the play of "Cato"
was founded. T'tica was a city in Northern
Africa. The adjeciive -'pent up" is merely
comparative and poetic, ior Utica was, during
the time of its prosperity, a large and impor
tant city. It was at first an ally of Carthage
in the wars between that city and Rome, but
subsequently prepared to submit to Roman
power. After Carthage had been subdued a
part of its territory . was given to Utica,
and the latter ciiy was maae the resi
dence of the Roman Governor. During
the war between Csesar and Pompey,
Marcus Portius Cato, or Cato the Young
er, a noble Roman commander, who had
made every possible effort io prevent the war,
had joined the side of Pompey, fearing Ceesar
as the greater tyrant. Pompey took, refuge in
Africa, rfhither Cato went to join him with a
small army, but before he reached there Pom
pey had been assassinated. Soon after the
army of Pompey was defeated by Csesar's
troops at Thapsus. That was in the spring of
tbe year 46 before Christ. Cato took refuge
with his force in Utica, which was the only
city which still held out against Csesar, but
when it became known that the conqueror's
army was on its way against the city also, the
Uticans refused to risk utter destruction by
further resistance, and Cato's eloquence was
powerless to persuade them to hold out
against the enemy, cato sent an embassy
to make terms with Csesar for the surrender of
the city and troops within it, but he, rather
than tail into the hands of the conqueror, re
solved to die, and after spending the night in
reading Plato's Phae io, committed suicide by
stabbing himself in the breast.

Three Days.
The Tahiti trader, Tropic Bird, arrived
yesterday with a full car^o of copra, pearl
shell and cocoanuts. No dock was ready
for her, so ehecame to an anchor off Lom
bard street, but later docked at Howard 3.
F. A. Healy was among the passengers.
The young man is the only son of Cap
tain Michael Healy of the United States
marine service. About a year ago he mar
ried Hiss Lucretia May Carpenter, but
divorce proceedings were soon instituted.
In order to facilitate matters the
young man went to Tahiti, and now
that the trouble has blown over he
has returned. The divorce was secured
and the young lady has resumed hei
maiden name. She is now on her way to
Australia.
Among the other passengers on the
Tropic Bird were Dr. Jan Madau, a well
known physician on the French group,
Rev. Thomas L. Woodbury and Rev. C. A.
Larsen, missionaries to the islands of tn<
Pacific, and A. C. Stone, an artist whe
made the round trip. The most interest
ing group on the trader was Pon Sbin and
his family. He is married to a kanakt
woman, and is the father of four of thÂ«
prettiest little sons that ever came intc
port. He is one of the wealthiest mer
chants in Papeete, and comes to San Fran
cisco on business.
Captain Jackson reports that when thÂ«
Tropic Bird sailed the French training-

President Coinon of the Harbor Com
mission left for Sacramento yesterday.
He will attend tne meeting of "the State
Board of Examiners, and give all the in
formation required in regard to the con
tracts .for the new ferry depot.
The Pacific Mail Company's City of
Peking sailed for Honcrkong via Yoko
hama and Honolulu yesterday. She toox
away an unusually large cargo and about
thirty cabin passenger*. Among the lat
ter were Mrs. H. B. Hunt and M iss Emma
L. Hunt, the daughter and granddaughter
of Harbor Commissioner Cole. Over half
a hundred people were down to see the
mother and daughter away, and Mr. Cole
was the most conspicuous in the crowd.
Mrs. and Miss Hunt will spend about three
months in touring Japan, ana they may
make a trip to China.
Dr. Souie will go out on tbe Oceanic
Company's Australia to-day. He has oeen
for some months laid up at the Waldeck,
out has now recovered. He is tbe surgeon
of tbe steamer, and during his temporary
indisposition his place was taken by Dr.
Leuscbner, late resident physician of the
German Hospital.
The schooner Una, which was supposed
to aye made a long trip from the Sound
to San Jose de Guatemala, was reported
yesterday as having arrived at her desti
nation on August 28.
The schooner J. N. Ingalls from San
Bias mads an unusually long trip and
people were beginning to wonder what
was the matter. On her way down the
main boom carried away and as a new
one could not be procured in Central
America the schooner had to return
minus her mainsail. She brought up 470
cedar logs and took sixty-two days to
make the run.
The British ship Dominion, after hover
ing arounl tbe Golden Gate for tbree
days, finally got in last night. She was
165 days out from Liverpool, but Captain
Meredith tbougiu he could sail in and
save towboat hire. He found bis judg
ment faulty and had to secure a tug.
Whitehall boats with runners aboard were
out to the vesse! and ashore again before
the captain would accept a tow.
Tbe tramp steamer Evan lale is receiving
quick dispatch. She had barely come to
an anchor last Saturday before "Luke"
Robinaon of Middleton <fc Co. was along
side with the dunnage necessary to load
her. She then went to Long Bridge and
took a lot of tallow and now she will go to
Port Costa and take in wheat. The steve
dores say she will beat the record for quick
arrival and quick dispatch.
The schooner Volant, in tow of the tug
Alert, got in from the wreck of the Colom
bia yesterday. She brought up two of the
steamer's boilers, but the captain reports
that he could not be alongside any longer
on account of tbe heavy swell that was
breaking the wreck to pieces. The chances i
are tbat nothing more will be saved from
either the Colombia or St. Paul.
Advices received by the Mail steamer
City of Sydney yesterday are to the effect
that the British tramp steamer Linlith
gow was rapidly drifting in a southerly
direction. The mate reported at Aca
jutia that Captain Petrie was daily writ
ing short memoranda and putting
them in bottles, after which the bottles

were consigned to the deep. Captains of j
all steamers bound south are requested as
a favor to keep a lookout for the bottles
and report at once to the nearest tele*
graph station.
The British ship Dominion, 161 days out
from Liverpool, arrived last evening. She
reports fearful gales in the low latitudes
in the Atlantic, in which she lost nearly
all her sails and was partially dismasted.

for the benefit of the carnival funds.
The Manhattan Athletic Club states
that the bare-knackle fight which recently
took place between William Bntt and Mr.
Lawlor was not fought at 1749 Mission
street as reported. The Manhattan is a
purely amateur organization.
The National Club is patiently waiting

In the East the principal topic among
sporting men is the Lavigne and Ever

Bohemian Athletic Club. New York, on
the evening of October 27. The pugilists
will meet at 133 pounds, Sam Fitipatrick,
manager for Lavigne, agreeing to pass the
lightweight limit in order to get on a
match.
Lavigne, it will ba remembered, has
already a victory over Everharlt, won in
a twenty-round contest. May 30, 1895, at
the Seaside Athletic Club, Coney Island.

concludes that one of the contestants is
having the worst of the game, with little
hope lor success. This precludes a possi

from other bodies and organizations out
' numbering the number of representatives
from the councils of the American Protec
tive Association, which recognized the call

Auditor. Professor George Davidson's
name has been placed before the conven
tion for the office of Superintendent of

Tbe convention will tax all its energies
in selecting the most acceptable material
for the offices of Supervisors and School
Directors. It is presumed that the full
ticket will be nominated by the end of the
week, as the convention bold" its sessions
nightly. In the platform and declaration
of. principles, as adopted at last night's
meoting, the convention declares in favor
of religious liberty, freedom of conscience
and non-seciarian system of politics.
Municipal extravagance and boss rule are
condemned, and the election of thorough

Suit for $100,000 Brought
Against a Steamship
Company.
CHINESE COMPLAINANT.
Mah Hung Says a Breach ot
Contract Deprived Him
of Liberty.
IS NOW IN THE COUNTY JAIL.
The Chinaman Claims to Be a Native-
Born Citizen, but Was Denied
a Landing.
A slant-eyed complainant of 17 Mah
Hung, is the last man to oppose the Dower
of the steamship company. Hung is
suing the Pacific Mail Steamship Corn-
pany for $100,000. His attorney is WaJde
mar J. Tuska, who relates the case in this
way :
July 25, 1896, Hang left Victoria, B. C,
on the steamer City of Puebla, with the
intention of entering San Francisco. He
received a contract and receipt guarantee
! ing to return him to Victoria in case tbe
local customs authorities refused him a
landing. If, however, he were permitted
to land tbe receipt was to be signed on the
reverse side by the purser of the steamer,
this entitling him to overpay for the re*
turn passage.
When Hung arrived he was taken charge
of by the Custom-house officers and his
right to land denied. Hung claims that
he is an American citizen by birth and
was born in a Tillage called Robinson,
situated near tne city of Eureka in Ne
vada.
Tbe matter was taken into the United
States courts by habeas corpus. Commis
sioner Heacock found that the evidence
advanced was not sufficient to permit the
! Chinese youth to land and so reported to
I the United States District Court. Through
his attorney Hung tiled exceptions to the
Commissioner's report, and the matter
was argued before Jud>e Morrow. He
confirmed Commissioner Heacock's report
and ordered Mah Huag's retura on board
the steamer City of Poebla.
In accordance with this order a United
States Marshal took the Chinese to the
wharf where the steamer was moored
' September 16 and attempted to deliver
! him over to Captain Debney. The cap
tain was informed of the court's order and
J a. so of tne certificate, or contract, and
I receipt held by Hung. But be refused
I absolutely to take tbe boy on board and
all the parleying and threats of the Mar
shal were of no avail.
As a result the Marshal took Hang to
the County Jaii, where be has since been
confined in a cell, the same as an ordinary
prisoner. His two cell companions were
both incarcerated on account of crimes
committed.
The foregoing is the case as presented
by Attorney Tuska. After giving the bare
facts he continued :
"The complaint alleges that tbe Pacific
Coast Steamship Company knew that the
boy would be placed in jail under the law
if he was refused his return passage on
the vessel. The order of the court was
indisputable evidence that he was not per
mitted to land.
"The damages asked may seem exces
sive at first glance. It must, however be
borne in mind that it was not mere breach
of contract, but that the man was de
prived of his liberty and given the hu
miliating treatment accorded a common
malefactor on account of the company's
action." ______ _______

A JAPANESE BURGLAR.
He Break* Into Several Boom* in the
Cosmopolitan Hotel and Is
Arrested.
Frank Ninsamato, a Japanese employed
in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Fifth and
Mission streets, was arrested yesterday
morning and boosed at the City Prison on
the charge of burglary.
About 3 o'clock in tbe morning W. K.
Eaeer, a commercial traveler from Salt
Lake City, was awakened by hearing some
one riding the pockets of his trousers. He
jumped out of bed and saw the Japanese
rush out of bis room and run ups:aira.
Eager awoke the croprietor, W. Fahey,
and took up a position at the stair land
ing so that he could see any one who came
downstairs. Fahey searched the upper
floors and the Japanese came along with a
broom in his hand. As soon as Eaeer
saw him he recognized him as the man
who was in bis room.
Eager found that $4 in silver had been
taken from his pockets, but fortunately
$265 in greenbacks had not been touched.
A watch had been stolen from the room of
A. Frints and a goid watch and chain
valued at $35 from the room of W. B.
Westley, which was found hidden in the
ladies' toilet-room. The Japanese bad
' also tried to open the door of a lady's
room, but she was awake and frightened
away the intruder.
Ninsamato was held till Policemen J. L.
Murphy, T. L. Ryan and Ed ODea ar
rived and he was placed under arrest.
Last March some of the guests were robbed
and it is suspected that tne Japanese was
the thief at that time also.

DUCEY'S EXCUSE.
Says the Pistol With Which He Killed
His Aunt Exploded Acci
dentally.
Peter Ducey was yesterday on trial in
Judge Wallace's court on a charge of
murder.
On May 27 last Ducey shot and killed
' his aunt, Kate McKeever, at tbe iatter's
; home, 917 Howard street. Ducey had been
I drinking heavily for several days before
the shooting, and on the night of May 26
went to his aunt's residence and went to
bed. In the morning he missed his watch
and claimed his relative had stolen it
from htm. She denied the accusation and i
after some word* ihe was khied by a shot i
from a pistol in Ducey's hands.
On the stand tbe prisoner swore that !
the shooting was accidental. He said that !
on the morning of tne tragedy he left the
house at 917 Howard street and went to
the home of another relative before he
discovered tbat be did not have all his be
longings. He then returned and accused
his aunt of taking his watch and aaked
her why she did not also take his revolver.
To this Mrs. McKeever is said to have re
plied tbat he had none, whereupon he
pulled tht weapon from his pocket, as he
said to sbo.v to her, when it accidentally
went off and killed ner.
Ducey's attorney claimed that he was
not of sound mind, by reason of his ex
cessive indulgence in intoxicant*. Tbat
the jury took this plea into consideration
is evidenced by the fact that they failed to
bring in a verdict up to a late hour last
night, although the case was given into
their hands before 4 o'clock.

CHINESE RESORT
TO NEW SCHEMES
Novel Efforts to Secure
Free Passage Back
to China.
HOW THE TRICK IS DONE
The Wily Mongols Claim to
Have Lost Their Registra
tion Certificates.
COME MAINLY BY THE SEA
Two Cases of tbe Kini Named Now
Before United States Commis
sioner Heacock.
The Chinese have frequently given evi
dence of their acuteness and general
ability to outgeneral Uncle Sam's ser
vants at the game called law, but the
latest device of theirs is a little ahead of
anything yet undertaken.
The-schenie is as bold as it has hitherto
been successful, but the worst feature of
the whole thing is that there is no appar
ent way to stop it. The trick is simplicity
itself and well worthy of the slippery
Mongol.
Briefly stated it is this: When a
Chinese desires to return to his native
land without any expense he contrives to
throw himself into the wide-spreading
arms of the law minus his certificate.
When asked to produce this valuable
document ue either declares it is lost or
that he never had one. In either case,
however, the result is the same â the
Celestial being ordered deported at the ex
pense of the Government.
It is said that the scheme is being
worked quite extensively by Chinese
reaching this port from northern cities by
the water route. Some days ago a vessel
from Alaskan waters arrived here with
tire Chinese on board. On the way down
one of the seamen, who, it so happens,
speaks a little Chinese, overheard a plot
which if executed would have resulted in a
loss to ihe Government of several hundred
dollars.
It appears four of tbe Chinese were anx
ious to return to their native heath, but de
sired to do so at the expense of the Federal
authorities. It was finally agreed that
the "boss" Chinese should take their cer
tificates and all the coin they possessed,
transmitting the same to the hea . of their
tong in China. On arriving at this port
tbe men were to declare that while they
had every possible right to be in this
country their papers proving tnis claim
bad been lost. The whole scheme was
blocked, however, by the accidental
presence of a white man who had a vaeue
knowledge of the Chinese language. When
tbe boat reached this port the live men
were threatened with arrest and imprison
ment, when they admitted the facts as
; recited above.
On Thursday last the flarry Morse, wiih
two Chinese on board, reached this port
from Pueet Sound. They were without
certificates, claiming to have lost them
while working tne mines of Alaska. Col
lector Wise now has them in charge, and
will hold them until a thorough investi
gation can be made. There seems to be
little doubt, however, that the men are
working for a free passage to China.
Their cases will be heard before Commis
sioner Heaoock this morning.
The possible profits in such a scheme

are at once apparent. It is an easy matter
to sell genuine certificates to Chinese de
siring to come to this country. There is
also another profit for the original holder.
Whatever money be may have is con
verted into Mexican dollars, thus doubling
his stock, and in addition to this the Fed
eral Government gives him a free ride to
China.
Collector Wise and Deputy Jerome are
busying their brains to find some law
which will fully cover the case. Unless
there should be* a stray section somewhere
in the archives of the Custom-house
Uncle Sam will probably be forced to pay
many thousand dollars "to the steamship
companies during a year's time. The
worst feature appears to lie in tha almost
absolute certainty that these "iost" cer
tificates will turn up in the possession of
some otner Chinese.
Twenty-four Governments, including the
United States, Japan, China. Persia and
nearly all the European countries, have
given official notice that they will exhibit
in Paris in 1900.

LONG SOLITUDE
FOR WINTHROP
"Amen!" He Said to a Life
Sentence to San
Quentin.
THE PRISONER'S SPEECH
The Supreme Court Granted a
Ten Days' Stay of Exe
cution.
JUDGE WALLACE DENIED IT.
Winthrop Claimed His Trial Was
Unfair and That Jurors Were
Bulldozed.
Oliver Winfield Winthrop will haye
plenty ot time in which to meditate on
the fol^jr of kidnaping rich men and
torturing them for their money.
He will spend the remainder of his
natural life in San Quentin State prison.
The crack of doom in hia case was
Judge Wallace Sentencing Oliver W. Winthrop to Prison for Life.
which to base the motion. This evidence
he said, was in relation to the witness
Urquhart, who had sworn on cross-exam
ination, that he had never been convicted
of a felony, when the attorney said he bad
since learned that the witness had been
so convicted. He also alleged "miscon
duct of one or more jurors." Important
affidavits, he said, were on the way here
from Manitoba.
Judge Wallace overruled all the mo
tions For a stay and a new trial. One of
the grounds for so doing was that he
thought there was plenty of evidence to
convict the prisoner without Urquhart's
testimony.
Turning to Winthrop Judge Wallace
said: "Have yon anything to say why
judgment should not be pronounced?"
Winthrop rose to his feet. His face was
white and earnest, but composed. Every
eye in a crowded courtroom was riveted
on one of the most remarkable criminals
of modern times. In a strong, clear voice
he answered the Judge, saying, "I have."
He was about to proceed when Attorney
Bell interrupted and made a sign to Win
throp to sit down. He said, "iiold on !"
Then Attorney Bell made a motion for
a new trial on statutory grounds, which
wai overruled. District Attorney Barnes
addressed the court in opposition to the
motion.
Wintnrop's turn came again. He said:
"I have, your Honor. In the first place,
before I came here for trial I was tried,
convicted and sentenced by the newspapers
of this community. I have not had a fair
trial. The prosecuting attorney bulldozed
the jury. He told them they were not fit
to sit in a court of justice if they did not
convict me. After I was arrested I was
persecuted to the full extent by the Police
Department."
Here Winthrop looked around the court
room and let his gaze rest a moment on
Captain Lees.
"My friends were denied me," he went
on. '-'They were even arrested. One ot
the moat honest and purest citizens of this
lown was dogged into the detectives' room.
When I came into this courtroom I was
pleased to see that I would be tried before
your Honor, for I knew that I would get
the benefit of the law."
Wintbrop paused a moment, as though
to-sitdown, but continued:
"I am not guilty of this crime. There
are material witnesses who are able to prove
this. It will not be long before they can
be had. Your Honor knows how it is when
an inexperienced woman goes out to hunt
up witnesses. My wife has beÂ«n trying to
find these witnesses."
Judge Wallace replied that he thought
the prisoner had had a fair trial and that
no complaint of lack of time was made
when the case was set for trial. He could
not see wherpin the prosecution had bull
dozed the jury. "If this can- be done,"
said the court, "the jury system had bet
ter be abolished." 'Facing Winthrop
Judge Wallace concluded with these
words: "The sentence of the court is that
you be confined in the State Prison at San
Quentin for the remainder of your natural
life."
Wintbrop flushed and then paled. He
did not seem to expect such a long term
of solitude. He looked nonplussed for
just a fraction of a second. Then be
bowed to the court and sat down. Tbe at
tendants close to the dock say that Win
throp said mockingly and in a low tone:
"Amen!"
The Judge called the next case. The
man who decoyed and tortured William
James Campbell in the California- street
cottage a iew weeks ago was shackled to a
common prisoner and led away to jail.
In the afternoon Attorney Bell secured
from the Supreme Court a stay of execu
tion for ten days^
BAD BENEVOLENCE.
Members of the German Council of the
United World Want It Dis
solved.
August Euler, Victor Soderburg and
eight other members of the German
Council of the United World have
applied to the Superior Court for an order
dissolving the defendant society and dis
tributing among the members tbe money
in its treasury.
It is alleged in the complaint that the
society is not legally incorporated and
that it is organized solely for the purpose of
preying on the unfortunates who have be
come members. The Supreme Council is
said to have but one member, namely,
Michael C. Brooks, who is said to have
diverted to his own use tbe money paid in
for dues and assessments.
The plaintiffs further allege that at a
meeting held June 9, 1896, they protested
against the manner in which its affairs
were being run and were ejected from the
hall.
Illicit Opium Still Captured.
The case of Lee Ong Guey, arrested some
days ago by Revenue Officers Cromwell and
Thomas, on & charge of running an illicit
opium still, was set for trial by Judge Morrow
on October 13. Six weeks ago Guey's place at
543 Washington street was raided by the offi
cers and a perfect opium manufacturing plant
discovered. The arrest was kept quiet for sev
eral weeks, under the impression that others
might be implicated in the affair. It now de
velops that the Chinese is the only offender.
PRINTERS MAKE PROTEST
They Prevent the Awarding of
the Great Register
Contract.
The Lowest Bidder Thought to Be
Inclined to Employ Non-Union
Typesetters.
The vigorous protests of members of the
Typographical and Pressmen's unions, as
well as the objections of a large number
of boss printers, prevented the Election
Commissioners from awarding the con
tract for the great register yesterday.
The bids opened were as follows:
Hick?, Judd & Co., 40% cents per name;
Filmer- Rollins Electro Company, 41 VÂ£
cents; Frank Eastman & Co., 42 cents; E.
Heringhi, 29% cents; W. J. Sterrett, 35}$
cents; H. S. Crocker & Co., 41 cents.
The bid of E. Heringhi was at once pro
nounced by the proprietors of printing
offices present as preposterous if the
work was done in the manner the board
would certainly wish it done.
They insisted that if Heringhi got out
the register at that figure he would have
to employ non-union labor or take it to
some interior point where work was
cheap, thus depriving San Francisco
printers of a large amount of work.
The proprietors pointed out they were
old-established firms, paid, taxes and em
ployed scores of men, paying union
wages. They mentioned that Heringhi
was not a job printer and that he kept a
sort of a pawnshop at 213 and 215 Pine
street, and in no way was connected with
this line of business.
Herinuhi said it did not concern the
commission how and where he did the
work. His money was up and as long as
he turned out a register according to speci
fications he was entitled to the contract.
After listening to protests from union
men, who called attention to the action of
the Board of Health in refusing to employ
any but union labor in whitening and
painting schoolhouses, it was decided to
lay the matter over until to-day to give an
opportunity for investigation.

Defends the Clerks.
Jerome Donovan, president of the Dry Goods I
Early Closing Association, defends the state
ment of certain clerks oi the Emporium that
their wages were docked for being absent on
Admission day. He supports his defense by
the affidavits of A. B. Campbell and W W
Cross.
Suspended for Five Days.
Captain C. J. Lundquist of the steam
schooner Albion has been suspended for five
days by Supervising Inspector Bermingham
for nearly causing a collision between his
boat and the steam collier Peter Jebsen.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1896.
WELL UNDER THE
DOLLAR LIMIT
Supervisors Fix the Tax
Levy for Municipal
Purposes.
MARKET STREET LOST.
The Main Business Thoroughfare
Will Not Be Repaved
Now.
BOARD OF HEALTH RAISED.
Thirty Thousand Dollars Added to
Its Appropriations â The Rate
Is Now 9693.
The Board of Supervisors fixed the tax
levy for municipal purposes at 96.92 cents
on the $100 yesterday, and thus set at rest
the hopes of those who wanted Market
street repaved, and the fearo of others who
thought that the Mission would lose the
high school for which it battled so
valiently. The matter came up in the
form of the following resolution, the expert
of the board having computed the rate on
the basis of $418,000,000 valuation :
Under and in pursuance of acts of the Legis
lature of the State of California, and in con
formity thereto, and under and in pursuance
of various municipal orders and ordinances,
and in conformity thereto, there is hereby
levied a tax for City and County purposes, for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, on all
property, both real and personal, in the City
and County of San Francisco, excepting such
property as is by law exempt from taxation,
and the sum of 96.20 cents on each $100 valua
tion, as aforesaid, is hereby apportioned to the
funds and accounts known and designated as
follows:
General fund 56.85, street light fund 07.18.
Street Department fund 10.50, school fund
12.50, library fund 01.25, park improvement
fund 05.93, interest account park improve
ment bonds 00.67, interest account City Hall
construction bonds 00.10, sinking fund Cltv
Hall coastruction bonds 00.67, sinking fund
park improvement bonds, 1872, 1873. 00.26,
sinking fund park improvement bonds, 1874,
1875, 00.23.
Supervisor Spreckels at once offered the
following resolution:
Resolved, That $30,000 is hereby appropri
ated to be used by the Board -of Health of this
City for the purposes of that board in addition
to the amounts allowed in the report of the
Finance Committee of this board filed August
3, 1896, and fixed by this board on that date.
Supervisor Taylor opposed the measure,
usintf strong terms in denouncing any and
all attempts to increase the amount of tax
ation, but the resolution carried neverthe
less.
Supervisor Waener offered a resolution
appropriating $150,000 for the repaying
with some noiseless substance of Market
street from the city front to Sixteenth
street.
The measure was lost by the following
vote:
Ayesâ King, Morgenstern, Wagner.
Excusedâ Taylor, Dimond.
Noesâ Scully, Hirsch, Hughes, Dunker,
Spreckels, llobbs.
A like fate met Supervisor King's effort
to give the City and County Hospital an
additional $6000, and the original resolu
tion, with the addition of the Board of
Health's $30,000, was adopted. It was de
cided to add the 72 mills called for by the
$30,000 to the general fund, br.nging the
levy for that purpose up to 57.57 and the
total levy for City and County purposes
to 96.92.
Tne National Athletic Club sent in a
petition to be allowed to give a ten-round
boxing exhibition during the month of
November.
A resolution offered by Supervisor Di
mond, employing J. P. Sullivan and J. H.
Meredith a<= special counsel to appear be

tainer, a lifce sum to be paid in case of
success.
A petition of the executive committee of
the Golden Gate Carnival for permission
to give a series of boxing and wrestling
contests of a limited number of rounds at
the People's Palace on the evening of
October 2 was referred to the Healtn and
Police Committee.
A resolution offered by Supervisor Tay
lor denouncing. Messrs. Morehouse,
Beamer and Arnold of the State Board of
Equalization for raising San Francisco

PRAISE BUT NO APOLOGY
Protestant Preachers Blamed for
the Shattering of Moral
Forces.
TWO QUESTIONS FOE FLEENOR
Editor Barry as Chairman Pays His
Compliments to Leaders of
the A. P. A.
Rev. Peter C. Yorke was again greeted
with a full house at Metropolitan Hall
last night, where he delivered the fourth
of the series of six lectures he has under*
tafcen to eive under the auspices of the
American "Women's Liberal League. The
subject of his lecture was "Ministering
AngeLs." The usual hearty applause
greeted the Catnolic champion's entry
upon tbe platform. He was accompanied
by James H. Barry, "who acted as chair
man of the evening. In makiag his open
ing remarks Mr. Barry said:
"I understand full well that you are not
applauding the individual, and therefore
I appreciate those cheers. I know it is
the cause I humbly represent that you ap
plaud â the cause of civil and religious
liberty."
After paying a tribute to the work of the
American Women's Liberal League for
its work in the cause of true liberty he
said:
"Of all the factors that have been op
posed to the A. Â±\ A. â conceived In in
famy and carried on in shame â none have
been more potent to bring them into con
tempt than the American Women's Lib
eral League.
"Let me instance what these A. P. A.'s
are. Only a few months ago I was stand
ing up against the best patron I had. I
denounced the Supreme Court for its de
cision. Suddenly I discovered he was a
member of the A. P. A.â that he was at
their meetings and saying, 'We mus' keep
these proceedings secret while we are try
ing to free the country from the red hand
ot the church of Rome.'
"The very day 1 found he was an A. P.
A. he visited my house with his wife. I
talked of nothing but A. P. A. and told
him how bad it was to be an A. P. A.;
how baa it was for an aspirant for office to
be an A. P. A.; how bad it was a man who
deiired to sit in judgment on his fellow
man to be an A. P. A., and all the reply
he made wan to nod his head."
His reference 10 Winthrop, who was
yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment
by Judge Wallace, as an A. P. A. elicited
great applause. "It is a pity," he con
tinued, "that they were not all sent in one
job-lot to prison." He placed Quitzow,
who defended Winthrop, and Price, who
was convicted of dealing in obscene litera
ture, in the same category with Winthrop.
Price boasted, he said, that it was impossi
ble to convict him; ''but we shall Bee that
this lecherous scoundrel is punished,"
added me speaker.
"The man who could live on a woman's
shame only ten years ago â and he is 40
years old now â and say it was only a boy's
indiscretion, is a reptile worse than any
other on this earth. This is what I think
of Benjamin F. Hudelson, the erand presi
dent of tbe A. P. A.," continued Mr.
Barry.
"Give it to him," shouted some one in
the gallery.
'â¢I am sorry," responded Mr. Barry, "to
say tnat in this case I am euchered. I
can't find words to describe him in the
English language.
"Nearly three years ago there stood on
this platform a man called the Rev. J. Q.
A. Henry and a man named Slattery, who
slandered the purest women on this earth.
The only reason, they said, they could see
for my action is that I hava been hypno
tized by Father Yorke and that I am in
the pay of the Catholic church.
"1 never realized the infamy of the A. P.
A. until my attention was called to an arti
cle printed in the A. P. A. organ attacking
the purest-minded women we know."
He read part of the article which broadly
implied, he said, that four iaaiea wno took
the oath of noviates were to become in
mates of a religious brothel. He next read
his defense printed in the Star of the
women who had thus been attacked. It
was these women, he said, that Father
Yorke would talk about, and this was his
excuse for bringing up these unpleasant
matters.
Cheers and wild applause greeted Father
Yorke's appearance.
"Where, oh, where has Fleenor fled?"
he began.
"Only a short ween ago he was rampant
on this platform. Can it be that only the
single question why he left Oakland
caused him to flee? If that ia so, then I
will ask him two more questions, so that
he may continue to nee.
"Why does he sign himself from Seattle
when he knows all about Ukiah?
"And the second question is: Did he
ever have anything to do with insane
asylums?
"Hy the time he answers these questions
there may be a story to tell.
"Even the honorable Mr. Quitzow was
compelled to hold his nose yesterday and
to apologize for one of his orators. Every
one of these reverend and irreverend men
connected with the A. P. A. have histories I
which st'nfc in the nostrils of decency.
"The Rev. Dr. Goodwin was in evidence
yesterday. giving the parting kick to the
Pope of Rome. He nicknamed me the
Czar of Ban Francisco and paid me the
compliment of saying that I had exiled
him. It is a poor compliment, though, to
call Los Angeles a Siberia. I want to tell
him that I am not a poundkeeper of
preachers. The Methodists seemingly be
lie7ed that a change of climate would do
him good.
"Who is responsible for the shattered
condition of the moral forces of this City?"
"Tbe preachers," came from an auditor.
"The preachers. You have said it, and
said it well," shouted the speaker.
"But they are not altogether responsi
ble. There is a certain time in the dog
days when all the canines go mad and
there is a period a few months before elec
tion when the wheels in the heads of the
preachers begin to go round and hate
takes the place of patriotism. The men
and women â oar brethern, our friends,
our neighbors, members of the Protestant
churches who permitted their pulpits to
be desecrated by montebanks â they are
responsible, and they are to be pitied, not
to be blamed. Let them look over their
desecrated and ruined churches and let
tbem know that this is God's judgment.
"One of the peculiar means to protect
our American institutions is this war
upon women."
He referred to the discourses of Henry,
Klatt.ery, Case, Fleenor and others directed
against the sisterhoods of the Catholic
chnrcii, and continued:
"I do not come to-night to make any
apology for tue Catholic sisterhoods.
Their lives and their work speak for them.
True men who make no profession of re
ligion would lay down their lives for the
honor of these women.
"My object this evening is merely to ex
plain to you something about these sister
hoods, their origin, their governments,
their work and their lives, so that those
not Catholics may know tbem as we do.
"Let me first tell them what the nun is.
She is sister to every Catholic man, to
every Catholic woman and to every Cath
olic child. Tbey all reverence her and
love her and would die for her."
He explained the need of organization
in doing good, as in other matters, and
said that among the organizations created
for doing good those composed of women
were far from being the least important.
Alter showing how the Catholic sister
hoods sprang into existence in order to
better perform charitable wort he ex
claimed :
"Who is Case that he should take the
place of fathers and brothers? Are not
these fathers and brothers able to protect
their women? Are tney migrating
preachers like this Case? Who is this
reverend blackguard who takes it upon
himself to do wnat you are periectly able
to do?
"Who are these gentlemen of the beetle
brow who object to the vow of the poscu
lant? Tbey are a cross between an Oregon
boot and & handcuff. The only things
these gentry are acquainted with.
"The vow these women take is only one
of obedience, chastity and poverty, and
before they are allowed to permanently
attach themselves to the sisterhood tbey
are made to thoroughly nnderstand what
they are about to do; their vows are made
in public and they are given every oppor
tunity to turn back, if they find that they
nave made a mistake.
"One thing which greatly disturbs these
defenders of our institutions is that the
sisters do not live on the roofs. They talk
of how the sisters are locked behind bolts
and bars, and of having the Legislature
appoint men to inspect them as if they
were pesthonses.
"The A. P. A., remember, will not in
dorse any man for the Legislature who
will not take a pledge to secure tbe
passage of a law providing for such in
spection.
"Everj' man's house, according to the
Magna Charts, is his castle. And are we
to allow these curiosity-seekers to poke
their noses into our houses?
"There is not a man or woman who can
not go to any convent in this City, as a
friend to another's house, and be "shown
through it from garret to cellar with the
greatest alacrity and pleasure by the sis
ters,
"Think of such men as Hudelson and
Price and Quitzow and Winthrop trying to
pledge men to pass a law for the inspection
of convents."
"They can't do it," shouted a man in the
audience.
"Iso; they can't do it as long as there is
an American man in the country," re
sponded the lecturer, laying special stress
on the word "American."
The nobie ana charitable work of the
Catholic sisterhood was reviewed at some
length. H- told of their labors ainonc the
lepers of Alabama and Molokai and among
the aborigines along the Yukon, in the
hospitals, in the day homes and other
places where suffering exists.
â 'To the Catholic sisterhood," he said,
"belong the credit of establishing the
present system of free schools, which were
inaugurated in CorK. We have our mag
nificent hospitals and other charitable in
stitutions, but they have been provoked Dy
the glorious ~orks of our sisterhoods.
"And the hardest thing to us is to hear
these noble women reviled Dy these scoun
drels ot the A. P. A."
His concluding words were: 'They are
to vs â even their very presence among us
â a blessing and benediction from on high.
A sight of them is a call to higher and
holier thoughts. They are our fallen na
ture's hignest, purest boast."
WAS EMMA ASHLEY SANE?
Her Sister Thinks She Was
Crazy When She Shot
at Baldwin.
Unblemished Family Record Opposed
to Some Scathing Allusions by
the Millionaire
"I think that my sister was undoubtedly
insane when she fired that shot," said
Miss Lillian Ashley in tremulous tones as
she turned and faced the jury yesterday
afternoon in Judge Bahrs' court. And
that, was the key-note of the testimony
duiine the fifth day of the trial of Miss
Emma Ashley, charged with taking a shot
at "Lucky" Baldwin.
The matron of the jail, Mrs. Leiitia
Gilmore, the first witness of the morning
session, said that when the defendant was
put in her charge she seemed oblivious of
the act she had just committed and only
asked for her Bible, and then sang "Nearer
My God to Thee," and pang it very beau
tifully too. S. M. Van Wycfc, one of the
defendant's counsel, who had also been
counsel for the sister, declared that judg
ing from Miss Emma Ashley 'a excited
condition at the time of the shooting, he
believed her mind was unhinged.
Miss Lillian Asuley told something of
the family history and of her experience
with "Lucky" Baldwin. The Aahleys had
always lived quietly on their old farm in
Vermont. In 1884 the father died. In
1889 Lillian became ill and went to a Bos
ton hospital for skilled treatment and
there Emma came to attend her. The old
home was sola for debt. In 1890 the
mother died. In 1894 Emma came to
California to visit Lillian, to learn for the
first lime of her sister's difficulty with
"Lucky" Baldwin and of the child.
Km ma eagerly absorbed all information
relating to the trial as it progressed. She
had never given any sign of planning to
shoot the millionaire, and when her sister
went to her afterward at the jail the pris
oner only looked up at her in a dazed sort
ot way and said, "God is love."
A thick volume, the Ashley genealogy,
was incidentally offered in evidence and
declared to show that never in the 200
years' family history it contained had a
criminal blot disfigured the escutcheon of
the Ashleys.
Baldwin had told Miss Ashley that she
should be his darling daughter and ulti
mate heiress, as one of his own daughters
had shamefully disobeyed him, and the
other he didn't speak to; she should be a
star in society and should have and com
mand anything that money and position
could obtain.
The defense finally offered in evidence a
series of editorials that had appeared in
the Los Angeles Porcupine. They roasted
"Lucky" Baldwin fearlessly. Twelve of
these articles Baldwin had considered
libelous, and had sued for $5000 damages
on each.
The case will go on again to-day. Both
sides will introduce expert testimony on
insanity. The defense hopes to put two
new witnesses on the stand to prove that
Miss Emma Ashley was temporarily in
sane. The prosecution may begin argu
ment late in the afternoon.

There promises to be some interesting
proceedings at the meeting of the Rail

seen from the following communication
addressed to Attorney-General W.|F. PiÂ«z
gerald, by Secretary Samuel Newman,
since the last meeting of the board :
At a meeting of this commission held on the
Bth day of July, 1890, it was determined to
proceed with an investigation of the oflairs
of the Maritet-street Railway Company, a cor
poration organized and existing under the
laws of this State, owning and operating vari
ous lines of street railways over and upon ihe
streets of the City and County of San Kran
clsco, upon which passengers are transported
and fares for such transportation collected
with a view to the fixing by this commission
of rates of charges to be collected by said Mar
ket-street Railway Company for such services,
and accordingly such investigation was regu
larly set for hearing before the commission for
the 7th day of September, 1896, at 1 p. m.
at the office of said Commissioners, in the
CnroDicle building, in said City and County
On the 13th day of August, 1890, this comm

T>yyou directed to Joseph L. Wilicutt, secre

bring with him at said time to be used on said
investigation certain books and papers of said
Market-street Railway Company theu in his
possession as secretary thereof, containing
matierrand evidence material on said investi

upon aaid Joseph L. Wilicutt prior to'tbe time
set for said hearing and return thereof duly
made. Said commission met on said 7th day
of September, 1896, at 1 o'clock p. m at iv
office and then proceeded to take up said in

DENOUNCES FREE SILVER.
Dr. Stebbins From His Pulpit
Declares It Would Bring
Disaster.
Common-Sense Must Again Save the
Nation When the Crisis Comes
in November.
Dr. Horatio Stebbins, from the pulpit of
the First Unitarian Church on Sunday
morning, denounced the free coinage of
silver as a measure fraught with both
moral and financial disaster. He said that
the experience of the world has shown that
the inflation of the currency of a nation
has always been followed by distressing
results. To his mind. this is the most im
portant public question that has arisen
since the Civil War, and he relies upon the
common sense of the people, that tradi
tional power, to decide, after the first furor
has passed, against the contemplated
wrong.
He spoke also in very strong terms of
condemnation of. political efforts to array
class against cla.*s, poor against rich, and
characterized iLa man employing such
methods as a foe of his Kind, mining at
the walls of society. During his discourse
he said :
The idea of this new generation is indus
trial, economic and anti-spoil. To abolish
the spolia opima of barbaric war in the ad
ministration of civil government, to apniv
just laws of trade and exchange to foreign
and domestic commerce, to determine the na
ture of money as the visible instrument of
right and wrong, to abolish the strange ab
surdity of overproduction hand in hand with
starvation; these are the problems of the mod
ern time to be decided for the peace and pros
perity of country and mankind. The manifest
facts of , the modern .lime are that power
is rapidly passing from the: hands of the few
to the hands of the many ; that nations are
becoming more human, and that all questions
ol human actions -and' relations are finally
moral questions. Even 'Li Hung Chang the
great Viceroy of China, as he makes the cir
cuit of ' the world tells about ."the welfare of
human kind." Time was when nations were
regarded as natural enemies. To-day they are
taking counsel together, how they can be just
without a quarrel. --Of J
The questions now before this country are
iiot merely matters of party politics, bat those
questions of human welfare < that I divide men
on lines of National Â©pinion and lead men be
yond politics into social philosophy.

riÂ«e above what is commonly called politics,
into the realm of reason, National sentiment
and of that sense which we call common. Par
ties are shaken and men look for the great
guides of condnctâ justice and truth.
The question before the country, than which
nothing more important has risen since the
Civil War, is the inflation of the currency,
which has social and moral bearings far be
yond the bounds of what we call politics.
Money is materialized ethics, the measure of
the value or the property of the peopie. To
counterfeit it or adulterate it is one of the
highest crimes.
It has been common for us as citizens of a
free State to say that a National election, with
all Its noise and tumult, is an education of the
people. Never was that truer than to-day, and
never was there greater cause for confidence
in the judgments of the common mind, based
not on learning but oa the instincts of com
mon sense, backed by the experience of na
tions and mankind. This is the ground of the
famous any ing of a great philanthropic writer :
"Tne voters of the United Slates have several
times iv dealing with financial questions ap
parently been about to do the wrong thing,
bni always at the critical moment the great
common sense of the people has asserted It
self and the wrong thing has been put down
and the right thing made to'prevail. 1 '
And what is this experience of mankind ont
of which philosophy v made as the teacher of
nations? That the inflation of the enrrency
of a nation has always been lollowed by na
tional and moral disaster. It plays a hocus
pocus, a kind of dark-lantern flash, on the
mind, and men think that money is wealth
and that because money is plenty tney are
rich. The mind is intoxicated as when real
estate is sold to the sound ot a life and drum,
and town lots seven miles from anywhere are
seen in the dizzy future as the center of thick
peopled cities. The industrious, frugal, busy
man is led to believe that il there are more
yard-sticLi there will be more cloth, and that
If weights and measures are multiplied there
will be more tea, coffee, sugar and wheat.
Thia is the old story over and over the world
over. Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Cal
houn utter the same voice, and all experience,
whether of National necessity or of personal
ambition, from the Red Dog currency of the
Middle West to the war necessities of the Gov
ernment, which known no law but the law of
war, to the "fiat money," which Garfield, of
illustrious memory for tnat, dashed into the
abyss of nothing, all consent in the same re
sult. Emerson deplored it. for it corrupted
the public morals, and George Bancroft de
plored it. for it increased the hardships and
distresses of the poor.
SENT TO SAN QUENTIN.
Hannah Land rid go Committed to Statc'a
I'rlson Instead of County Jail.
Hannah Landridge, the woman who
was last week returned to the City Prison
in a state of intoxication, after having
pleaded guilty to a charge of grand lar
ceny, was yesterday before Judge Beichei
for sentence.
While recovering from the effects of her
debauch the Landridge woman intimated
to the prison officials that she would, when
up for sentence, tell the names of two po
licemen who had induced her to commit
the crime and who had shared the pro
ceeds.
Judge Belcher read the statement as
published in TnE Call, and when the
prisoner appeared yesterday asked her if
she wished to make any statement or
withdraw her plea of guilty. The pris
oner had nothing to say, but her attorney
in her behalf remarked that she belonced
to a respegtable family and that she had
never before been arrested. He said that she
did not receive 5 cents of the proceeds ot
her crime ; that she did not deny that she
was guilty. The clemency of the court
was therefore asked.
The argument seemed to have had little
effect on Judge Belcher, who sentenced
the prisoner to two and a half years in
Ban Quentin.

Explanation.
The arrow files with th* wind. The top figures
,at station Indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It, If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
tines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "bltfh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washinctoo
coast, when the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
1 north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, wuinei
weather may be expected in summer and coldei
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition*
trill produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
; *â  â  I li. uncial. ,
Nl w YORK, N. V., Sept. 21.â The railway
and miscellaneous stock market was strong and
higher to-day. Business was not active by any
means, but tha trading was well distributed. The
demand from outside sources as of late was light,
but the professional element was generally
arrayed on the bull side of the account. The latter
was more favorably Impressed with Saturday's
bank statemen , the easier condition of the
money market, the arrivals of gold from Europe
and the reports of the starting up of mills in New
York and Pennsylvania. Money on time was In
be ter supply and a lew transactious were reported
at 6 per cent on good stock exenange collateral
without a commission.
in regard to gold Imports it was announced that
Â£203,000 American eagles had been sold by the
Bank of England for shipment to New York.
The opinion obtained that at least $16,000,000 ad
ditional will be forwarded to this country in the
near future. This would brine the total importa
tions since An? 28 ud to $50,000,000. At in
tervals operator* were disposed to tage profits,
but the offerings were qnickiy absorbed and near
the close a number of stocks sold at the best
figures of the day. The unfavorable reports of
the Northwest roads for August and of the
Northern Pacific lor the second week of Septem
ber were generally ignored. - .
Manhattan was the special feature, and after an
early decline to 8514 jumped to 88(g,875^ A re
port was current th.it a deal was on foot, with the
Metropo i an Traction, sugar, leather preferred,

Reading, Northern Pacific preferred and Western

gained v i>oint on a story that the offiKials of the
various companies In Chicago were endeavoring
to arrive at an understanding in regard o the
rates. In lie final ..ea. ings the grangers and the
low-prised issues were in particularly good request.
Speculation left off strong, with prices anywhere
from 14 to 21/* higher than a*, the close on Nut
urday. Tola. sales were 173 01 shares, including

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, tab, Sept. 12.â The crowd found
bull news on wheat a scarce article this morning,
figures and information tending generally to en
courage selling rather than buying. A liberal
quantity of wheat has been waiting for some days
for prices to oulge, and their failure to display
anything but heaviness this morning brought out
considerable of It. Before the opening the curb
trading was at easy quotations, the estimate that
the world's shipments for the week would aggre
gate 8, 250,000 bushels having a depressing effect.
An Increase In the amount on ocean passage of
1,520,000 bushels and In the visible supply of
2,050,000 bushels only added to the weakness on
the ' regular session. Liverpool cables were *4d
lower. Receipts at Chicago were 173 cars ana the
Northwest had 1108 cars, against 1052 last Mon
day and 1655 a year ago. Local Inspections from
store were 172,282 bushels. Closing Continental
cables were lower. Export clearances amounted
to 256,170 bushels. About neon the Northwest
sent some buying orders and the execution of
them caused a slight rally. Later shorts covered
free and a firmer feeling developed. The English
visible supply decreased 11.000 bushels- De. em
ber opened at 61c, sold between 60%Â£i60(tac and
62 Vie. closing at 62y B @62i4c, 8 /iÂ©i%i" higher than
Saturday. Estimated receipts tor to-morrow 360
cars.
CORNâ corn market was weak and lower,
sympathy with wheat, early largely Influencing
the tone, while the regular news was not calculat
ed to infuse courage among holders. Receipts,
395 cars, were 17 more than expected. Withdraw
als from store amounted to 540,854 bushels. The
visible supply Increased 614.0 jO bushels and the
amount on ocean passage 400,000 bushels. Liver
pool cables were unchanged Danublan shipments
of corn last week amounted 10 376,000 bushels.
Kxport clearances amounted to 291,434 bushels.
May corn opened a. 24Â«4c declined to 248/ 8
24% c, closing at 2434 c, y 8 under Saturday. Esti
mated receipts tor to-morrow 700 cars.
OATSâ Were quiet and easy. Traders looked to
wheat for their guidance, and as thai market was
weak there was no alternative for oats bat to
adopt a like tone.- The visible supply Increased
382,000 bushels. Receipts were 343 cars, and
253,733 bushels were taxen from store. Export
clearances amounted to 55.18s bushel*. May oats
cloied a shade higher. Estimated receipts for to- .
morrow. 440 cars.

interest prevailed from start to finish.
The delegates from the outside town
ships came to the convention determined
to have one of the Superior Judgeships.
They went back without it, as the city,
with Alameda, had made a splendid or
ganization on behalf of Judge Greene and
dam P. Hall, and it proved invincible.
Tain defeat, however, was manfully shoul
dered, and wb-n the motion was made to
make the nominations unanimous no one
cheered more lustily thÂ»n Murray Town
ship, which had put up a strong fight for
its favorite, George W. Langan.
The most bitter struexle was over the
affirmation of Charles Mautalen as com
mitteeman from tne Sixth Ward. Several
votes were taken before the matter was
finally settled, as the convention was
about equally divided as to the indorse
ment of the chairman of the County Com
mittee.
Quite a point was scored by the Alameda
delegation by the insertion of the tidal
canal plank in the platform. This will
cause much discussion later on, and the
communications to the War Department
on the subject will be greaiiy augmented.
A very attractive delegation of ladies oc
cupied seats in the galleries and cheered
gayly when the suffrage plank was read.
The Alameda committee had provided a
band to till in the recesses and the young
ladies of the Methodist church across tb<Â»
Btreet provided a dainty lunch. They
never catered to a hungrier or more distin
guished t>arty, and that Alameda church
has certainly earned the record of being
able to give a meal for the benehtof the
heathtn that was of equal benefit to a pol
itic an.
Ear.y in the day Judge J. J. Allen an
nounced his withdrawal from the Judge
ship fight an-1 decided to make an attempt
to succeed himself as Justice of the Peace.

A BUSY PIONEER'S
LIFE IS CLOSED
Death of Dr. E H. Pardee,
an Old Resident of
Oakland.
LANDED IN THE PANAMA
An Ardent Republican Both in
State and Municipal
Governments.
HAS HELD MANY OFFICES.
Made a Wor d-Renowned Target Shoot
at San Bruno Station Thirty
Tears Ago.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 21.â Dr E. H.
Pardee died at his home late to-night. The
immediate cause of death was exhaustion,
consequent upon an operation that was
imperative, though for several months he
has been an invalid and has been gradu
ally growing worse since the Ist of lam
May. Dr. G. C. Pardee was in attendance
upon his father all day with Dr. Rucker,
but at 10:30 he breathed his last.
The late Dr. Enoch Homer Pardee was
one of the very best-known pioneers of
the State. He was born in Rochester,
N. V. f on April 1, 1827, and was therefore
67 years o! age at the tine of his death.
His father was French and his mother
German. His parents moved to Michigan
when he was but 7 years of a^e. When 15
years old he was seized with a disease
of the eyes known as Egyptian
opbealmia, and after consulting the
chief medical skill of the principal
Eastern cities in vain, he was finally
cured by a Dr. Bigelow of Detroit,
wbo had himself been blind for ten years.
After recovering his Bight he entered upon
a course of study with Dr. Bigelow and
obtained the secret of his treatment.
Then he entered Ann Arbor College in
Michigan and took a reeular coarse of lec
ture? in medicine. He came to California
in 1849 in the steamer Panama and landed
in S*n Diego. He arrived in San Fran
cisco the 6th of January, 1850.
He went to Marysvllle and turned auc
tioneer, receiving as payment an "ounce"
a day. He went to the mines and worked
successfully, and on the 4th of July follow
ing had 97000 on hand, tne result of hard
work and perseverance. The breaking out
of the cholera that year him abun
dant employment at his profession, but
he caught the malignant infection and
came near dying.
Boon getting disgusted with life in the
mines he returned to San Francisco
about February, 1851, with a capital of
$12,000 to $15,000.
T t.e doctor after some donbt as to
whether he should return East or remain
in California opened an office in Brenbam
pluce, on the plaza. In San Francisco,
where he continued to practice medicine
and treat diseases of the eye until burned
out His next office was at 737 Clay street,
where he continued to treat pa
tients successfully for twenty years. 11l
health caused him after a time to confine
his practice alto/ether to diseases of the
eye and ear. Patients flocked to him
from all parts of the Pacific Coast, and he
would frequfntly have from 80 to 140
patients a day visit his office. Half of his
patient-, at times, would have to be
treated gratuitously. In 1865 Dr. Pardee
returned to the Middle States and gradu
ated at the Rush Medical College in Chi
rago. After two years he returned to San
Francisco.
His nrst visit to Oakland was in 1852,
where be hunted quail and rabbit*, and
was ediried with the spectacle of bull and
bear fights on Twelfth street. The doctor
came over to live in 1867, and has been a
stealfast and prominent Oaklander ever
since, holding various public poaitions
and offices of trust. In 1869 be was elected
to the City Council, and was re-eleoted in
1870, 1871, 1872, and in 1876 was placed in
the honorable position of Mayor of the
city.
The doctor was always an ardent Repub
lican in politics, having attended the very
first meeting of that party organized in
San Francisco. In Oakland he was, from
the first, a leading man in the councils of
his party, and was elected to the Legis
lature as jmnt Assemblyman with Mr.
Crane in 1872, serving with credit to him
self and satisfaction to his constituent*.
There was no more popular member in
the i ouse to which he belonged, his
genial manners and fund of anecdotes, as
well as his practical ability, having made
him a pener.il favorite.
Several important local measures were
passed through his exertions, and be re
ceived an ovation from his fellow-citizens
on bis return home at the conclusion of
his arduous legislative labors. He has
been a successful business man as well ai
professional man. Mining stocks had
charms for him as well as others, and he
was generally successful in his ventures.
Dr. Pardee was also distinguished as a
marksman, having made shooting a
hobby nearly all bis life. In 1866 be made
bis best score. He shot witb Warren
Land at San Bruno station for $1000. mak
| ing in 100 successive shots 131 inches,
distance from shot to center of bullseye â
the best target known to the world. The
demand upon him for fac-similes of that
target was so great that he had them
lithographed, and tbsy have been sent to
all parts of the world.
Dr. Pardee was married in 1865 to a
young lady of his own name in San Fran
cisco. In 185 siÂ»is only-son and child, Dr.
George C. Pardi-e, ex-Mayor of Oakland,
was born. His wife died in 1870, and he
has been since a widower. There are few
more elegant homes in Oakland than that
of the late Dr. 11. Pardee, on the corner of
Eleventh and Castro streets.
For the past two years Dr. E. H. Pardee
has led a retired life and has not taken an
active part in politics, bit he practiced as
an oculist until a couple of years ago.
HOLLAND'S STORY.
Gives Hi* Explanation of the Arm
strong Kpinode at Stockton.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 2Lâ Detective
Holland, whom R. B. Armstrong claims
called him a crook, arrived home to-day
from Sacramento, where be went after his
trip to Stockton on Admission day. Id
regard to the matter, he says:
"There were seven officers watching for
pickpockets at the point where Armstrong
was arrested. We all saw him come along
in the crowd that was standing at the
head of the c annel. This was hull a mile
from the steamer where Armstrong claims
he had been with a friend. He looked
toward the woman and then felt about her
pocket. When' he raised his hand we
grabbed him."

ALAMEDA, Cal.. Sept. 21.â The restau
rant proprietors are anything but pleased
at the result of the convention to-day, as
far as they are concerned. They sub
scribed liberally to the fund for the ar
rangements of the gathering and expected
to gather a rich harvest in feeding the
hundreds who came to the city. How
ever, in this they counted without their
host, for the ladies of the Park-street
Methodist Episcopal Church opened tbe
doors of that edifice, witb beautiful young
ladies to wait upon their tables, and as a
result captured the major portion of the
vast assemblage.
E. A. Randlett, who worked so hard for
tbe success of the gathering, said : '1 will
have all of the restaurants well advertised,
but nothing shall be said of the church
dinner, for they have not contributed a
cent toward our expenses."
Central Committeeman F. J. Fletter was
more forcible than polite in bis condemna
tion of the ladies' work. Some of those af
fected threatened to have the ladies ar
rested to-morrow, but they bare no fear
of any such proceedings.
The church will realize about $125 from
the ladies' efforts, which will go a good
ways toward many needed improvements
in contemplation.

908 Broadway, Sept 21. {
The annual election of officers of St.
Mary's College Athletic Association was
held this evening in the college hall. In
this election the greatest interest is al
ways manifested by the student body, and
the enthusiasm displayed on this occasion
was no exception. Intense, but friendly,
rivalry existed among the different can
didates and their constituents. The chief
interest centered in the race lor president,
the candidates being J. W. Solen and J. J.
Greeley, both of '97.
Both were nominated by brilliant
speakers, but the eloquence of B. J. Flood,
â¢97, so thoroughly impressed the students
that they were convinced that J. W. Solen
was the right man for the place. He was
accordingly elected to the position. J. P.
Cone, '00, was elected vice-president; C. J.
Mogan, '98, secretary; T. H. Donovan, '98,
treasurer; and W. J. Rattigan, '00, field

PAPERS BY PASTORS.
' -. "' "" ' . â  â¢
Themes of Interest Discussed by Lead
â¢ ing Preachers.
Rev. Theodore Burnham of Vallejo pave
an informal address to the Presbyterian
Ministerial Union, yesterday on the sub
ject of " the" Theological Seminary. He
urged closer communion between the
church at large ana the seminary arid
greater financial support on the part of
the laity.
"It is unfortunate," he said, "that your
seminary has not been able to be put on a
sympathetic footing with the people. 1
Rev. T. Burnham also said he highly ap
proved of not ordaining young men till
they had been a year out of the seminary.
That year, he thought, should be passed
in assisting a tried and experienced pastor
in his work. .; : â. .
At the Congregational Monday Club
Professor C. F. Nash spoke about "Friend
ship with Jesus Christ Through Service."
The professor has lately recovered from a
serious illness, and part of his remarks
dealt with the way in which friendship
with the divine master is quickened
through sickness and suffering. He laid
especial stress on friendship with Christ
in work and in private and spiritual life.
Rev. G. R. Stanley and Rev. D. W.
ChiJson, two of the new pastors appointed
to this City at the recent conference at
Pacific Grove were present at the Metho
dist preachers' meeting yesterday. , Dr.
Jewell and Dr. Phelps are not expected to
arrive here till Thursday.
Rev. G. H. Jones of Oakland read a
paper on "The Responsibilities of the
Present Conference Year." He dwelt par
ticularly on the need of strength and
courage. On the motion of Dr. J. S. Car
roll it was resolved that it was to the best
interests of the churches to adopt as soon
as possible the order of services adopted
by the recent general conference.
Announcement was made of the serious
illness of Dr. Colburn and of the indis
position of Bishop Foss and Dr. Cantine.
Rev. E. J. Wicks, recently of Courtland,
was reported to be dying at Ukiah.
Rev. Eli McClish, D.D., will make the
address at the opening of the educational
season of the Y. M. C. A. on October 1.
â¢ââ¢ ââ¦ ââ¢
Supervisors Restrained. '
Judge Slack yesterday issued the writ of
prohibition prayed for by George G. Gauld
restraining the Supervisors from opening bids
for the People's Mutual Telephone franchise.
The writ is returnable before Judge Murphy.

THE "EXAMINER" AND ITS
SILVER FIGHT.
Blundering Inconsistencies Exposed by
Its Own Contradictions.
Mr. Hearst Was Formerly Opposed to the Policy for
Which He Is Now So Loudly
Vociferating.
Quite a number of patriotic and thoughtful persons, who have chanced to casually
elance at the San Francisco Examiner during the past two years, having had their at
tention drawn to it by reason of its erratic freaks and fakes, have been greatly amused
lately by its vehement support of Altgeld and Bryan, its advocacy of Bryanism, and
its defense of the course taken in the Chicago convention.
It will be still more amusing to such persons as have occasionally glanced at the
columns of the paper which maintains what it calls a "freak" editor to learn that
there are many freaks which that journal does not class as such, which, nevertheless,
creep into its editorial columns from time to time with the solemnity of sober earnest.
It is interesting, in view of the Examiner's wild and unqualified indorsement of the
money plank of the Chicago platform, to read its views of a little more than a year
ago, when it spoke in calmer tones than now, and before it had grown garrulous over
"the Boy Orator of the Platte."
The journal that now advocates free silver as a panacea for every economic ill had
occasion to answer a correspondent, who inquired for wisdom on silver, in its issue of
June 27, 1895. The correspondent asked : "Would it be possible that the free coinage
of silver could hurt oar trade with nations that have the gold standard?" The Exam
iner's reply, printed in the editorial columns, was as follows:
EXAMINER AGAINST FREE COINAGE.
The free coinage of silver under proper international agreement -would help
our trade with all the world, but free coinage by this country alone, unless It suc
ceeded in bringing both metals to a parity, which would hardly be possible,
would certainly injure our commerce with countries having tho gold standard.
We see the same effect now in countries that are on a silver basis. The fluctua
tions in the price of silver so disturb international exchange aÂ« to make trade be
tween gold and sliver using countries partake of the nature of a gamble. All the
profits of a transHCtion may be wiped out by a change la the silver market, or, on
the other hand, they may he doubled. This is a discouragement to legitimate
commerce and tends to put trade in the hands of speculators.
Having shown how the policy it now advocates would ruin the country the paper
which makes freaks its chief feature discoursed on the consequent evils of free silver as
follows :
To abandon the sale of our products abroad would mean a revolution in our
domestic Industries, with much suffering while the readjustment was going on.
And as we owe large amounts to foreigners we should either have to keep sending
on goods enough to pay interest or should have to drain the country of all its
precious metals. Last year our exports of merchandise exceeded our Imports by
over 5237. 000.000, and if we had not the foreign trade ail this would have to be
sent out in specie.
On June 26, 1895, the Examiner congratulates Chairman Gould for his manly
stand in refusing to call a meeting of the State Central Committee of the Democratic
party to declare in favor of silver, and adds :
Business is reviving, factories are working on good time, wages are going up,
farm products are bringing better prices and new enterprises are being daily
launched.
Speaking of Mitchell's free-silver ideas in the issue of the 28th, the Examiner says:
Even such eccentric views as Mr. Mitchell's ought not to be deprived of
whatever benefit they coutd gain from good manners.
The "eccentric" ideas of Mr. Mitchell have since been incorporated into the Demo
cratic platform, made the Shibboleth of Bryan and indorsed by the Examiner, which
commends the Altgeld programme as the acme of American patriotism. Here is what
the Examiner said of Governor Altgela, Bryan's right Dower, in its issue of June 7
1895:
The free silver movement in Illinois has not been helped by its identifica
tion with Governor Altgeld. The recent lynching of the perpetrators of a felo
nious assault because the lynchers were afraid Alteeld would pardon the crim
inals has brought into renewed prominence the erratic twist of the Governor's
mind, which makes him distrusted and feared by every friend of order and
good government.
Having predicted failure for any "wild attempt' on the part of the United States
to coin silver at 16 to 1 unaided, the Examiner of June 4, 1895, burst forth in the fol
lowing prediction of bankruptcy and disaster:
The attempt of the United States to establish the bimetallic ratio of 16 to 1
throughout the world would, in case of failure, bring us to a silver basis and
cause the greatest financial crash we have ever known.
On June 28, 1895, it recognized silver as being a Populist craze unworthy of seri
ous attention, and said:
A dangerous growth in the Populist vote would encourage the sliver men to
new efforts, while the maintenance ot Democratic strength would be taken by
the politicians as an indication that free silver could be safely dropped
The files of the Examiner foralon<r period show conclusively its antagonism to
the free and unlimited coinage of silver, while its twin, the New York Journal, de
nounced Bryan's plans and the Democratic platform so late as the week following the
promulgation of the Chicago platform and the nomination ot the "boy orator" amid
scenes of unexampled revelry and political hallucinations.

Mr. Newton is of a very nervous tem
perament and is excitable. His station
in life, quiet habits, family and social rela
tions are such that he has never felt the
heavy hand of the law on his shoulder
until Sunday night last, and the new ex
perience has well nigh unstrung him.
He spent all of Sunday at his country
home, where, in his vast garden, lie culled
an immense basKet of fragrant flowers for
presentation to bis sister-in-law, Mrs.
Thomas Morffew, on this side of the bay.
As night fell Mr. Newton, wearine a wide
rowboy biack Bombrero and carrying his
floral offerine, started for this City, which
be reached shortly after 8 o'clock.'
Anticipating the pleasant surprise he
was about to give his relation he silently
stole along the street near Gough hoping
to suddenly enter the house at 1725 Pine
street and astonish everybody with his
presence.
But the policeman, a burly fellow with
misdirected detective proclivities, was on
his tracK. He had followed Mr. Newton
for some time, and his bewbiskered face
under the shade of the broad batdid much
to make the officer believe that there was
something wrong about the man;
"Stop there!" shouted the policeman
rushing up to the flower bearer, who was
stealthily trying to enter the house.
Newton looked back, but continued to
move on â actions calculated to excite the
suspicion of a true guardian of the peace.
He therefore pressed the pace and with
club on high seized Mr. Newton by the
collar and held him against the wall.
"What have y>u got in that basket?" he
asked in an authoritative tone.
"None of your business," was the first
answer tnat came to Mr. Newton's mind,
but he modified it by saying, "Flower.-.' 5
"Flowers; are they?" suspiciously
asked the officer. "Where did you get
them ?" And he reached to investigate.
Newton drew away as ho said: "I
brought them from my home at Moscow
Cottage."
That settled it in the mind of the police
man. Of Moscow Cottage he knew noth
ing, but his knowledge of geography
located Moscow somewhere in Russia, a
place so distant and so prolific of nihilists
and so devoid of flowers that the man
under detention must be worthy of fur
ther investigation.
At this juncture Dr. Thomas Morffew,
ex-presiiient of the State Dental Associa
tion, brot er-in-law of Morris Newton
hove in sight on his way home. He saw'
that a struggle way going on in front of
his house and Newton recognized him.
"Tom, Tom ! For heaven's sake come
here, this man takes me for a burglar!"
shouted Newton.
Dr. Morffew approached his relative and
identified him, avoiding thereby any
furt er melee. The officer continued on
his beat, a rather discomfited man, wnile
Morris Newton went inside to nurse a
bruise or two.
Last night Dr. Thomas MorHew, who
was seen by a Call reporter, said :
"I don't blame the policeman a bit.
Newton loosed like a burglar under that
hat and the officer had every right to over
haul him. If all suspicious-looking indi
viduals were siopped as Newton was and
made to explain their actions at in this
case honest people would stand a better
chance."
It is proposed to sen.i forty thousand
unmarried women from Eastern Canada
to British Columbia for the purpose of
supplying the demand for wives. The
same thing was done once by France lor
the benefit of the preponderant bachelors
of Eastern Canada, and the results were
entirely satisfactory.

BUSY DAY IN THE BIG CASE.
Deimas & Shortridg* Dismiss the
Craven Suits as Against All But
the Three Children.
Mrs. Theresa Alice Oelrichs, very pale,
complaining of a raging headache, a little
awed by the occasion, too, but still wear
ing a look of determination that charac-
terizes her, sat for nearly two hours yes
terday afternoon at the other side of a
narrow table from D. M. Deimas, answer
ing and refusing to answer and sometimes
evading the answer to a chain of very per
tinent questions respecting herself and her
sister and her brother and her father and
her father's wills.
Mrs. Oelrichs and Miss Virginia Fair and
Reuben Lloyd and Charles 8. Wheeler
and Russell Wilson, their counsel, arrived
on time and spent the waiting half hour
quite pleasantly.
Before the proceedings began, however,
the ladies and the lawyers were all served
with notice of the new move made by
Deimas and Shortridge on the part of Mrs.
Craven. It was a dismissal of the suits of
Mrs. Craven apainst Charles L. Fair and
others to recover possession of the Mission
street property, and of the suits against
Theresa A. Oelrichs and others lor the re
covery of the Sansome-street property â
that is to say they were dismissed as to all
the defendants except the neirs. The
ground upon which this was done is the de
cision of Judge Slack annming the trust
clause in the will of the 21st. Under that
will the title to the property would have
passed to trustees.
The court having decided the trust
clause void it is held that the title goes
immediately to the children, and so the
suit was dismissed with regard to the
others. An affidavit was made by Mr.
Deimas setting forth that Mrs. Cvlricbs
and Miss Fair were necessary witnesses
for plaintiff, and notice was served that
depositions would be taken regarding the
validity of the deeds at 10 o'clock next
Monday morning before Notary Phillips.
As stated botb the ladies and the lawyers
were served, and Knight & Heggerty ac
cepted service for Charies L. Fair.
The witness in answer to questions
stated that her name was Theresa Alice
Oelrichs, her residence Fifth avenue, New
York, her husband's name Herman Oei
richs, and that she was married June 3,
1890, she thoughtâ yes, she was pretty sure
it was 1890.
Continuing she said:
"I am the mother of one of the contest
ants; he was born in New York November
2, 1892; be still resides therewith me; I
am the eldest dauubter oi the late Senator
James G. Fair; I was boru in Virginia
Cty, Nev. ; I came to this City when 13
years of age; I resided here until my
marriage, when I removed to New York,
where my husband resided; the last time
I saw my father alive was in the latter
part of Novemb-r, 1895; I am not sure of
tliedate; I was visiting here at the time;
I had visited the Stute once and perhaps
twice between that time and 1890; I came
here immediately upon hearing of my
father's death; I remained here until the
latter part of May, ana went from here to
Newport, R. 1., remaining there about
three months; I sailed the Bth of last
April for Europe; visited London and
Paris returning i went to New York,
where 1 remained one day, going thence
to Newport again and returned to New
York, remaining until two weeks ago,
when I came here."
"When in this City after your father's
death did you see a document purportine
to be the last will of your father? I re
fer to a paper dated September 24, 1895,
written in lead pencil."
"I did, in Mr. Lloyd's office, on the 16th
of March. Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Wheeler, my
sister, my husband and Mr. Dey were
present. I don't think I saw the docu
ment afterward. That was the only time
I ever saw it, there in Mr. Lloyd's office.
My brother, Charles L. Fair, was not pres
ent at the interview. 1 do not know where
he was at the time."
"Did you on the 18tb of March or there
abouts sign a petition to tne court asking
for the probate of that document?"
"I believe we did; yes, sir."
"Who suggested that you sign it, or how
did you come to sign it?"
"We thought best to sign it at that
time. We thought it was the genuine
will?"
"What made you think so?"
"We thought it was my father's hand
writing."
"Had you ever seen your father write?"
"Many times?"
"y;ou had received letters from your
father?"
"Yes, sir."
"Before sicnine the petition did any one
advise you to do so?"
"Yes; my legal adviser and my friends
advised me to â to use my own judgment."
"And did you use your own judgment?"
"To a certain tuent."
"On what else besides your own judg
ment did you rely ?"
"Upon the advice of iriends'"
"You acted upon their advice?"
"I signed it; consequently I must have
acted upon it."
"You signed it pursuant to the advice
of friends?"
"I dor:'t know what you mean ?"
"Will the reporter read the question?"
The reporter did so, and Mr. Deimas
changed the question, saying that perhaps
the witness did not understand the word
pursuant.
"Was there any consultation between
yourself and your sister and your brother
on the subject?'
"I don't remember; I knew what my
sister was to do ; I knew nothing as to my
brother."
"Did you know that your brother had
already signed it?"
"I don't remember."
"When did you learn that Judge Van R.
Paterson had been appointed guardian of
your child? '
"I don't remember the date. It was
after we reached home; we learned about
it through our attorneys."
"Did you make examination of the
pencil will and sufficiently satisfy your
self of its genuineness as to warrant you
in petitioning the court for its probate?"
"It was difficult to examine it ; it was in
a glass case. I did examine it, however,
and thought it was my father's will."
"What caused you to change your view
of the matter?"
"Weil, since we first saw the will cir
cumstances have changed. Numerous
things have come to our notice that we did
not know of before and changed our
belief in the matter."
"Will you please tell us what circum
stances have changed?"
"Well, one of the witnesses has produced
a deed, which she claims my father gave
her, to the 6an>ome-st reet property and at
the Mission, and 1 am quite sure, know
ing my father as I did, that he never gave
any one anything, let alone such valu
able property as ttiat. Then within the
past few days we have heard of a party
who is wiling to testify that he saw the
will written, the first few lines of it, any
how. These circumstances and other
things have made me come to the conclu
sion that everything that has been pro
duced is a forgery."
"When did you learn of the party you
speak of?"
"About a week ago."
"From whom?"
"I decline to state."
"What is the party's name?"
"I do not know."
"Where does he live?"
"1 never heard that he lived anywhere."
"Did you yourself seek to communicate
with this party ;"
"I did not."
"Was it not your brother who informed
you of the existence of thia party?"
"I decline to state."
"Was it Mr. Knight or Mr. Heggerty?"
"It was not."
"Was it Mr. Dey?"
"No, sir."
"Was it not your brother?"
"I decline to state."
"What did your brother say to you on
this subject?'
"Nothing particular. Ido not remem
ber."
"What did he pay at this interview?"
"What interview?"
"The interview whereat this subject was
mentioned."
"Nothing particular."
"Have you stated all the circumstances
that have caused you to change your mind
on this matter of :he genuineness of this
will of September 24."
"I have not stated all of them, no; but
I decline to state any more."
"Have you examined the deeds that you
referred to?"
"I have seen the photoeraphic copies.
The writing does not look at all like my
fa hers?" *
â¢ How long did you remain of the belief
that the will of September 24 was gen
uine?" 6
"Until three or four months ago, when
the other documents were produced. I
beard numerous circumstances then and
since then that caused me to change mv
mind.
"Were you advised that until Thursday
of last week your attorneys were in court
C ?n t o" g for tne genuineness of this
"We were advised of the proceedings of
m a Â£ lo , rne ys. but I have not been person
ally following the matter; my husband
was attending to the matter."
The witness admitted being a reader of
the San Francisco papers and following
the proceedings in that way.
Mr. Deimas read excerpts from printed
reports of proceedings in court, as follows:
tn 'V M J; Â°/ Ticha h Â«-d done what I conceived
I a <%, JBJ B dvt y." retorted Mr. Paterson, "if he
had filed a contest of the pencil will, i would
not interfere with his management of his son."
The witness said she had not seen it.
Then Mr. Deimas read againâ an expres
sion from Mr. Lloyd:
The will of September 24 \va3Â£ubmiUedt9
Mrs. Oelrichg, to her sister . and to all- inter
ested, and they . all â¢ concurred that it was Id
Mr. Fair's writing and is his wilL Believing
Jr. 'Ji a Mr> Oelricbs does, he does not â¢â  believe
It is his duty to contest â  the will. . He has ex
amined the surroundings and docs not believe
it necessary to file a contest. -*~
She said she hat not seen it, nor had she
heard of the expression.
An adjournment was here taken until
this morning at 10 o'clock.
Arguments on the motion to require W.
S. Goodfellow to produce in court several
wills alleged to have been made by James
O. Fair were to have been heard by Judge
SlacK yesterday. The matter was, how
ever, postponed until September 26, by re
vest of Mr. McEnerney.
STOLE ELECTION
OFFICERS' DEMANDS
James E. Barry Captured
With a Forged
Warrant.
THREE OTHERS CASHED.
Thieves Made a Heavy Haul in
the Registrar's Office
Yesterday.
SOME CLERK WAS CARELESS.
The Stolen Papers Realized On Be
fore the Theft Was Dis
covered.
A clever thief or thieves succeeded in
purloining five warrants calling for $200
from the Registrar's office yesterday and
in cashing three of the demands, aggre
gating $120, before their loss was noticed.
Deputy Registrar Peter McGlade ia the
man on whom the responsibility of the
loss rests, for he has charge of the office
and is expected to be on band there at all
tiroes. The first intimation that any
thing was wrong came when some one
came and called for his warrant. It was
then noticed that the small remaining
bundle of election officers' warrants was
missing and the chief deputy at once hur
ried to the treasury to stop payment on
the missing documents if possible.
To his chagrin be learned that the war
rants of W. R. Plumb, M. Grady and
H. A. Yon den Nunberg calling for $40
each, had been forged and cashed. While
McGlade was standing in the Treasury
asking about the missing papers a man
came in and presented one of the war
rants, to whichthe name of M. McKenzie,
the owner, had been forged.
On seeing the chief denuty he dropped
the warrant and ran oat into the corriaor.
McGlade folJowd, and fortunately saw
Policeman H. J. Wright pa^sin and
a^ked him to place the man under arrest,
which was done. On being taken to the City
Prison and charged with forgery he gave
the name of James E. Barry and said he
was a shoemaker living at 361 Clementina
street. He said that the warrant liad been
given him as a present by a man who said
he owned it and that he did not know it
was forged. He could not explain why he
ran when he saw the chief deputy* nor
would he give the name of his generous
friend. The officials of the Registrar's
office do not believe that Barry stole the
warrant, but that it was purioined with
the others by some one wno gave the
papers to different persons to cash after
forging the names. This person Is being
searched for. There is still one warrant
missing, made out in the name of M.
O'Brien. McKenzie, whose warrant aided
in Barry's detection, served as an officer
in the thirteenth precinct of the Thirty
ninth Assembly District.
Registrar tlinton said last evening that
he was not in the office during the hours
when the papers were stolen, but that it
must have been done during the after
noon. He thought som* clerk after looking
through the only remaining bundle of
warrants must have laid it on the counter
for an instant and attended to some other
duty, and during thai time t c warrants
were stolen. All of the other papers were
not taken, the demand for the .rent of the
registration place being left.
Barry claimed that it would be found it
was all a mis-take and that the demand
warrant was at; right.
WANTS cl MOiiLY NOW.
John M. Cavariy Jr. Seeks to Terminate
His Father's Will Trust
Another action has been brought to
terminate a trust made by will. This
time it is the testament of John M. Cav
ariy that is attacked.
Mr. C.ivarly died about a year ago,
leaving property valued at $87,543 41,
$37,210 of which is in real estate. By the
terms of his will be bequeathed the prop
erty to the Union Trust Company in trust
for his five children. The trust was to
continue until Frank B. Cavariy, the
youngest of the heirs, shoul i attain the
age of 30, or, in the event of bis death,
until he would have reached that age. It
was also provided that in case of the death
of any of the legatees hie suare should go
to any issue be might leave.
Yesterday John M. Cavariy Jr. peti
tioned the Probate Court for partial dis
tribution of the estate, alleging that the
trust created was void in its inception.
He asks that a fifth of the value of the
personal property be at once delivered to
Dim and that his share of the real estate
follow as soon as the estate is settled.
A species of frog Id Borneo has very
long toes, and these are webbed to the tip.
It can leap from a tree, spread its toes
and is thus supplied with four little para
chutes, which enable it to easily descend.
For this reason it is called "the flying
frog."
EVERGLADES OR
THE PRESIDIO?
Enlisted Men of the Fifth
Artillery May Go There
or Stay Here.
ELECTION IN PROGRESS
One-Fourth of the Regiment
May Elect to Remain in
San Francisco.
CFFICERS MUST GO SOUTH.
Belief That Petticoat Influences in
Society Caused the Order of
Transfer.
The Presidio is in a state of turmoil and
agitation. It will be cause for special
wonder if the Fifth Artillery is not prac
tically disorganized. The only topic of
talk at the post is the order transferring
the regiment to Florida. A new element
of confusion is introduced by the supple
mental orders received Sunday and an
nounced yesterday to the troops. The
orders provide "that all enlisted men of
the Fifth Artillery who desire to remain
at their present station will be permitted
to do so and be transferred to batteries to
arrive. All enlisted men of the Fifth Ar
tillery who have six months or less to
serve, and who do not intend to re-enlist,
will be left at their present stations for
transfer to organizations to arrive."
Under this ruling an election to remain
or leave is practically in progress. Yes
terday the men all along the line cau
cused and discussed the question. It is
common report that all men who en
listed on this coast will elect to go to
Florida for the reason that at the expira
tion cf the period of enlistment tney will
receive from the Government a consider
able sum of money as an allowance for
transportation to the place where they
enlisted. For like reasons men who en
listed in the East will stay here to get
the transportation allowance back to their
Eastern homes. The operation of the
rule will take most of the registered voters
away from this City before the election.
Already twelve men of Battery E and at
least fifteen of Battery L have'elected to
remain at the Presidio. Several days'
time will be allowed to make a choice.
Among Californians who have enlisted in
the Fifth Artillery there is a strong desire
to go East aud the order of transfer gives
them pleasure, but when they hear com
rades wno have served at Key West talk
of yellow fever ravages they hesitate about
rendering a decision.
Service at St. Augustine awakens pleas
ant memories among soldiers who have
been there, but the men realize that only
two batteries can be stationed at that post.
If tne two batteries to be placed there were
now designated the men could vote intel
ligently, Dut the assignment is to be made
by General Ruger commanding the de
partment of the East, so General Granam
himself cannot now say which batteries
will be sent there.
According to the indications at the Pre
sidio last nig t one would infer that at
least one-fourth of tue regiment will re
main here and be transferred to batteries
of the Third.
In point of discipline and soldierly qual
ifications the Filth Artillery is not sur
passed. It is familiar with the armament
of San Francisco harbor. What the regi
ment will be or what San Francisco will
get in the way of a garrison, when the
authorities at Washington have carried
out the scheme to save the First from
Southern duty, is a matter of conjecture.
The suspicion has deepened into belief
that important facts have been withheld
from the Secretary of War by underlings
who are privileged to handle communica
tions at the department When Senator
Perkins returns from Fresno leading citi
zens wiil request him to present the facts
in the case directly to Secretary Lamont.
Senator White will also be asked to re
quest the Secretary to investigate.
Army men here are confident that the
Secretary of War does not know that the
First Artillery has served only one tour of
three years in Florida since the war, while
the Fifth Has served three terms, nine and
a half years all told, and is now ordered
for the fourth tour of duty. Besides, it is
proposed to deprive San Francisco, whose
fortifications are extensive and modern, of
the troops fami iar with the armament.
The Secretary, taking the matter in hand
for his personal investigation, will likely
discover in a short lime that petticoat in
fluence' rather than requirements of the
service we suggested a transfer of the
Fifth to tet-p the First in New York so
ciety.
1 he undue haste in time of peace to rush
the troops from California 10 Florida lends
color to the suspicion that the under
strappers fear t at the scheme will be up
set 11 the transfer is not rushed.
WOES 0. A POLICEMAN.
John T. Euler hrought Suit, but His
Wife Is Divorced.
Judge Seawell yesterday granted a di
vorce to Elizabeth Euler from Policeman
John T. Euler on the grounds of cruelty.
The case is a peculiar one. Euler orig
inally began suit against his wL'e, aliening
crnelty, vulgar language ana habitual in
temperance. The parties were married
April 28, 1894, and resided at 853 Fifteenth
street. The husband said that his wife
would take money he entrusted to her and
go off on a soree.
On May 10 last Mrs. Euler is alleged to
have, in company with another woman,
visited Golden Gate Park, where they met
two men, unknown to the policeman.
The party of four is allege! to have visited
a number 01 saloons and drinking resorts.
A; any rate, tne oolicem.in says his wife
came home early nexi morning in a state
of intoxication, her new cloihes dirty and
ruined, and reviled him when he expostu
lated.
The next morning, referring to a former
experience, the husband inquired, "You
will not ask to come back after your con
duct of yesterday ?"
To which inquiry he says she replied:
" No, I don't waut to come back. I
thought you would get on to yourself after
a while.' "
Mrs. Euler filed an answer and cross
complaint to her husband's charges,
denying all his allegations and in turn
charging him with extreme cruelty. She
said he frequently cursed her ana often
drove her from home.
Euler did not oppose his wife's cross
complaint and consequently she was
awarded the decree.
Judge Sanderson yesterday granted a
divorce to Henrietta Hansen from Jorgen
A. Hansen on the ground of desertion.
Floretta Doyle was divorced from James
Doyle Jr. by Judge Murpny. Desertion
and failure to provide were the erounds.
