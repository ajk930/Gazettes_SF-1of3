CONGRESS MUST FREE STRUGGLING CUBANS
Report Favoring Recognition of Patriots
Submitted to the Senate by
Cameron.
Mills and Morgan Back Up the Foreign Relations
Committee With Some Pointed Facts
and Precedents.
1 Statesmen Boldly Declare That Spain Is Not the Mother Country of the
Afflicted Island, but a Cruel Stepmother Whose Domination
Has Caused Endless Robbery and Most
Inhuman Persecution.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 21.â The
general anticipation of an exciting scene
in the Senate Chamber over the Cameron
resolution recognizing the independence
of the repuDlic of Cuba, and particularly
over the defiant position taken by the
Secretary of State, had not the effect of
bringing a large crowd into the gallery
this morning.
There was no more tban a fair number
of spectators. The attendance of Senators,
however, was quite large, including Sena
tors Sherman of Ohio, Davis of Minnesota
and Cameron of Pennsylvania on the Re
publican side, and Senators Gray of Dela
ware, Hill of New York and Voorhees of
Indiana on the Democratic side.
At 12:20 p. h., Cameron rose and said
that he was in>tructed by the Committee
on Foreign Relations to report a joint
resolution acknowledging the independ
ence of Cuba, with a written report
*hereon. He moved that the resolution
and report be laid on the table and
printed, and said that the resolution
wou;d not be called up until after the
holidays. A tacit acquiescence was ex
pressed.
Vest (D.) of Missouri offered the follow
ing resolution:
Resolved, That tbe President is not vested by j
onsijtunou with the power lo determine 1
vthea the independence of a foreign people, |
struggling to establish a Government for i
themselves, shall be recognized by the United
States; but this power is vested in Congress
and is to be exercised In conformity with sec
tion 75, article I, in the constitution.
Senator Vest attempted to precipitate a
debate on the Cuban question by declar
iug that Secretary Oinsy's position was
preposterous; that it was the first time a
Cabinet officer bad communicated his
views on a great public question through
the public press. He said he was dear in
his opinion that the fr^mers of the consti
tution in committing to Congress the
power of maKing war also included the
smaller question of the right to recognize
governments.
At this point Hale, who in the absence
of Senator Allison is acting chairman of
the Appropriation Committee, interposed
an objection and the resolution went over
till to-morrow.
Hill (D. ) of New York then came
.into the discussion for tne second time
â¢with a resolution recognizing belligerency
in Cuba tind proclaiming the neutrality of
the United States, the text of which is as
follows:
It Is hereby declared that a state of war ex
ists in Cuba, and that the Cubans are entitled
to and are hereby accorded belligerent rights
in accordance with the principles of interna-"
tional law, and the United States will observe
a state of neutrality between the belligerents.
This also went over until to-morrow.
On behalf of himseif and Senator Mills
Senator Morgan of Alabama submitted
an elaborate report on the Cuban ques
tion. It takes pronounced grounds and
indorses the action of the committee.
Morgan submits as appendices to this
report tbe report to the Senate made by
Blidell in 1859; the speech of Senator
Judah P. Benjamin on that report; the
case of Cuba as submitted to tbe State
Department by Palma, and that part of
President's message relating to affairs in
Cuba. The report was ordered to be printed
with (he Cameron report.
Cuban resolutions were also offered and
referred as follows:
By Bacon (D.) of Georgia, that the ques
tion of the recognition by this Govern
ment of any people as a free and in ie
pendent nation is one exclusively for the
determination of Congress in its capacity
as the law-making power; that this pre
rogative of sovereign power does not ap
pertain to the executive department of the
Government except insofar as the Presi
dent is under the constitution (by the ex
ercise of the veto power) made a part of
the law-making power of tbe Government.
By Chilton (D.) of Texas, that a con
dition of public war exists between the
Government of Spain and tbe Government
which has been maintained for some lime
by force of arms by the people of Cuba,
ond that the people of the United States
shall maintain strict neutrality between
the two powers, extending to each all
rights as belligerents in the United States
and Territories.
INTERVENTION IS IN ORDER
Precedent* Cited to Show thÂ« Cubans
Should Be Krcoanie-a.
WASHINGTON,*; D. C, Dec 21.â The
report from the Committee on Foreign
Relations on the joint resolution acknowl
edging the independence of Cuba and
offering the friendly offices of this Govern
ment with Spain to bring to a close the
war between Spain and the republic of
Cuba was presented in the Senate to-day.
It is a document of very great length and
deals thoroughly, though briefly, in \ its
opening with modern precedents of Eu
ropean intervention where independence
Was the issue involved, the committee
The San Francisco Call.
f having examined with care all the in
; stances which have occurred during this
| century of peoples claiming independence
by right of revolt. The opening lines of
i the report read that Congress at its last
session, after long and patient considera
tion, adopted with practical unanimity
the expressed sentiment that the time had
come for resuming intervention with
Spain for the independence ol Cuba. Spain
having declined to listen to any represen
tation founded on an understanding be
tween herself and the insurgents, and
Congress having pledged itself to friendly
in tervention, the only question tbat re
mains to be decided is tbe nature of the
next step to be taken with proper regard
to the customs and usages of nations.
With little further preamble, the report
then refers as its first instance, showing !
that the modern precedents of European
intervention where independence was the
issue involved began with Greece in the
struggle which lasted from 1821 until 1827.
The summary of events in this strife
where within a month the rebels got pos
session of all the open country and all the
towns, except so far as they were beld by
Turkish garrisons, is told in a graphic
manner. The Sultan called all Mussul
mans to arms, the Greek patriarchs were
hanged at the doors of their own chnrches
in Constantinople. Several prominent
merchants were massacred, several Chris
tians were killed and the Russian Embas
sador insulted. It is shown that no Gov
ernment in Europe sympathized with the
Greek rebels. Instances of the struggle in
which tbe Greeks fought for independ
ence were constantly pointed out, but not
until the "Pope induced Turkey to
consent to allow her affairs to be discussed
in a general conference did Russia insist
that tbe Greek insurrection should be in
cluded among tne subject* of mediation."
The Turkish Government declared in the
most energetic language that it would
never admit of such interference and
would not make the affairs of Greece a
subject of negotiation with Russia. The
history of that struggle is carried on to the
date on which, the Sultan declining to the
last to permit any mediation between
himself and bis devoted subjects, the
three powers of France, England and Rus
sia, on the sth of July, 1827, united in a
formal treaty, signed in Loudon, which
committed them to intervention in case
the Sultan should still reject their prof
fered mediation.
Following in regular order, then, in its
details of circumstances in European na
tions ciaimingindependence on the ground
of the right of revolution, the cases are
mentioned of Belgium against the Nether
lands in 1830, when the King of Holland
was coerced into accepting conditions im
posed by the powers upon a show of armed
hostility; in November, 1832, by the Gov
ernments of France and England. The
coincident rebellion in Poland, in which
the Czar notified the Minister of the new
French King, Louis Philippe, that he
would tolerate no intervention in Poland
is given attention. Then follows in the
series of European nations claiming Inde
pendence ti.e recital of the deposal from
the Hungarian throne of the Haps
burg dynasty, followed by the elec
tion of the patriot, Louis Koesuth, as pro
visional President and tbe intervention of
Russia on tbe ground tbat if she did not
so intervene Hungary would establish her
independence.
"This precedent," continues the report,
"tended to establish the right of every Gov
ernment to intervene in the affair of for
eign States whenever the sitnation should
tend to endanger its own safety or the
peaceful equilibrium on its frontier." As
far as known every other Government in
the world tacitly acquiesced in the estab
lishment of this precedent If any Gov
ernment recorded a protest it was that of
the United States, but then the United
States protested only by inference from
the acts and language of the President
The Russian intervention brought the
wars quickly to an end; before Octo
ber all resistance was over, and when Con
gress met early in December, 1849, Presi
dent Taylor's annual message could only
proclaim what woujd have been American
policy.
Interventions have occurred most con
spicuously in Spain by France in 1823, in
Portugal by England in 1827, atrain in
Spain and Portugal in 1816 by England
and France under what was called the
"triple treaty,' 1 and many instances of
national interventions in the history of
other States are alluded to, while in 1816
the intervention in the affairs of the Otto
man Empire have been so constant as to
create a board of jurisprudence and a long
series of treaties on which the existence of
ail political systems of Southeastern
Europe seem now to be more or less en
tirely based.
The precedents quoted, the committee
considers, make it clear that Europe has
invariably asserted and practiced the
right to interfere, both collectively and
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 22, 1896.
separately, amicably and forcibly, in
every instance, except in that of Poland,
where a European people has resorted to
insurrection to obtain independence.
European intervention in affairs in Asia
are briefly adverted to, as are the at
tempts made by France and England
during the American Civil War; then fol
lows a recital of events regarding the
recognition of the independence of Texas
and the action of the Government regard
ing Mexico, all of which are graphically
and lengthily detailed.
In tbe question of the American policy
it is pointed out that Lord Castlereagb, at
the Congress of Aix la Chapelle, in Octo
ber, 1828, proposed to the four other
powers to intervene in the war between
Spain and her American colonies by ad
dressing offers of mediation to the two
belligerents. Russia rejected the scheme,
not because it was intervention, but ap
parently because it was mediation and to
that extent recognized right in the insur
gents. When President Monroe inter
posed his fiat tbat no interference could
be countenanced by him except on the
basis of independence he dictated in ad
vance tbe only mode of intervention which
he meant to permit.
After a delay of four years from the
time when he began his policy the Greek
Tevolt fn Europe and the military suo
cessors of Bolivar and Iturbide in America
gave the desired opportunity in America,
and Monroe sent to Congress his cele
brated message on March 8, 1822, recom
mending the recognition of all the re
volted colonies of Spainâ Mexico, Colom-
Dia, Chile and Buenos Ayres.
Much space 13 given to the effect of this
act, which, this report says, proved the
deepest sensation among European con
servatives and gave to the United States
extraordinary consideration. Monroe'l
creation of a "new system of interna
tional relations" is elaborately eulogized.
In the case of Texas it is shown tbatihe
United States Government exercised the
whole rieht of intervention against an
American power. Graphically the report
depicts the dangers from the intervention
of France and England that threatened
America during the Civil War, and allu
sion is made to the French Minister
urging his Government to recoenize the
Southern Confederacy. The report deals
very thoroughly with the schemes ar
ranged by Russell and PaJmerstonaud the
Emparor Napoleon to intervene at the
time of our Civil War from 1861 with ref
erence to the active operations of Napoleon
in Mexico; the sending of 35,000 men
to re-enforce the French army there and
simultaneously sending a formal invita
tion to England and Russia to intervene in
the American Civil War.
"These papers," the report says, "have
not been published, and we do not know
the express grounds on which the invita
tion was offered or declined.
"To the fact," says the report, "that
Russia was avowedly friendly and the two
most powerful Prime Ministers of their
time were outvoted in their own Cabinet
America owed her escape from European
domination. "
Then with particular reference to Cuba
the report declares the Government of
the United States has always regarded
Cuba as within the sphere of its most
active and serious interest. As early as
1825, when the newly recognized Btates of
Colombia and Mexico were supposed to be
preparing an expedition to revolutionize
Cuba and Porto Rico, the United States
interposed its friendly ofnees with those
Governments to request their forbear
ance.
The actual condition of Spain seemed
to make her retention of Cuba impossible,
in which case the United States would
have been obliged, for her own safety, to
prevent the islands from falling into the
hands of a stronger power in Europe.
That this emergency did not occur may
have been partly due to the energetic
Monroe announcing "our right and our
power to prevent it," and his determina
tion to use all the means within his com
petency "to guard against and forfend it."
This right of intervention in matters re
lating to the external relations of Cuba
asserted and exercised seventy years ago,
has been asserted and exercised at every
crises in which the island has been in
volved.
Reference is made to the action taken
by Congress in the last session requesting
the President to interpose his friendly of
fices with Spain for the recognition of
Cuba. "This action was," the report de
clares, "taken on great consideration and
just principles," on a right of interven
tion exercised twenty-seven years ago and
after a patient delay unexampled in his
tory. The interval of nine months has
proved the necessity of carrying it out to
completion.
Tbe report declares that there is con
clusive evidence, in the opinion of the
committee, tbat "the inability of Spain to
aeal successfully with the insurrection
OLNEYâ "Anything for Cuba ? " GROVERâ " Nit ! "
has become manifest and tbat it is dem
onstrated that her sovereignty is extinct
in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful ex
istence; and alt Lough the President seems
to have a different conception from ours
we believe this to be tbe actual situation
in Cuba."
The regular organization of an insur
gent government, the introduction of a
constitution and election of a President are
alluded to; then military foroe "sufficient
to baffle the exertions of 200,000 Spanish
soldier"' 1 , ml the.rciril administration is
given consideration, and tbe committee
says: ''Tbe only question that properly
remains for Congress to consider is the
mode whicii should be adopted for the
step which Congress is pledged next to
take. The Government has none but
friendly feelings for Spain, and there is
no friendly offers which Spain could ask
which the United States within the limits
of their established principles and policy
would not be glad to extend. In the pres
ent instance they are actuated by an
earnest wish to avoid the danger of seem
ing to provoke a conflict."
The report ends with recommending
the joint resolution recognizing the inde
pendence of Cuba and the offering of
friendly offices to Spain in order to bring
the war to a close.
MILLS AND MORGAN VICIOUS
They Join in Scoring Spain and, Speak
ing in Behalf of Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 21âSen
ators Mills of Texas and Morgan of Ala
bama of the Foreign Relations Committee
join in making an additional report on
the Cameron resolution. While they give
the majority report their unqualified ap
proval, concurring in all that is said in
that report, they deem it well to present
some additional reasons for agreeing to it
and for the passage of the resolution.
They quote the report of the Committee
on Foreign Relations in 1859 when that
committee was considering the Senate bill
making appropriations to facilitate the
acquisition of Cuba by negotiations, and
make this comment on that report:
"That report covers a period of fifty-nine
years and sets forth the political condi
tions and the disastrous effects of Spanish
rule during" that time. They are tbe same
in their leading characteristics that ex
isted at tbe beginning of tbe insurrection
that was set on foot by the native popula
tion in 1868 in the outbreak at Yarra,
which was followed by ten years of inter
necine warfare attended with horrible
butcheries. The causes that provoked tbe
uprising of the native Cubans are the
same that are stated in the report of the
committee made ten years previously, in
1858."
The sum mine up of that report is quoted
as follows: "There can be no doubt that
an immense majority of the people of
Cuba are not only in favor of but ardently
desire annexation to the United States.
It would be strange indeed if they were
not so, deprived of all influence even in
the local affairs of the island, unrepre
sented in tbe Cortes, governed by suc
cessive hordes of hungry officials sent
from the mother country to acquire
fortunes to be enjoyed at home, having
no sympathy with the people, among
whom they ar? mere sojourners and upon
whom they look as inferiors, liable to be
arrested at any moment on the most
trifling charges; tried by military courts
or submissive justices, removable at
pleasure; punished at the discretion of
the Captain-Generalâ they would be less
than men if they were contented with
their yoke. Spain is a country of coup
d' etat and pronunciamento. The all-pow
erful Minister of War of to-day may be a
fugitive to-morrow. With the forms of a
representative government, it is in fact a
despotism sustained by the bayonet, a
depotism tempered only by frequent, vio
lent and bloody revolutions. Her financial
condition is one of extreme embarrass
ment."
Senators Morgan and Mills continue:
"Spain is not the 'mother country 1 of
Cuba, even in the sense of having sup
plied tbat island with a large part of the
ancestors of the present population. Â»ne
is a cruel stepmother whose introduction
into the Cuban family has been the im
mediate cause of the robbery of the step
children of their inheritance and their
cruel persecution to keep down revolt.
The committee were engaged in 1858 in
providing for the purchase of Cuba by
negotiating witb Spain, and were an gen
tle in their description of Spanish rule in
Cuba as a decent respect for the world's
knowledge of the truth of the actual situ
ation of the people there would permit.
It is dark enough without the illumina
tion of the tires of devastation that suc
ceeding years have interposed in Cuba."
After quoting the speech made in the
Senate on February 11, 1858, by
JudahP. Benjamin, which they consider
a more complete statement of the condi
tion of the people of Cuba and the
methods of the Spanish Government in
that island then than is stated in tbe re
port of the committee in 1859, they con
tinue:
"The relations of Spain and the
United States were not then strained
by the disturbance of actual insurrection
in Cuba as they were afterward from
1868 to 1878, and have been almost ever
since and are now, by excessive and inhu
man abuses of power in Cuba, to which
no limit can be anticipated, either as to
the time when they will end or the in
creased cruelty which is now a settled
feature of the present Spanish war of ax
termination. The President recognizes
the fact that the present war is for inde
pendence on the part of the Cubans, and
not for the gratification of personal ambi
tion or alone for the redress of personal or
political grievances with which tbe painful
history of their suffering is crowded. For
the sake of liberty and the independence
of their country they are willing to forget
the recompense that is due them for their
individual sufferings.
''Hon. T. Estrada Palma was duly ac
redited as diplomatic delegate plenipo
tentiary to the United States, under an
appointment by the Constitutional As
sembly of the Republic of Cuba. He ap
pears to have been received informally,
for the purpose of presenting the cause of
Cuba to our Government, on December 9,
1895. He addressed a note to the Secre
tary of State, accompanied by a statement
of facts, in which the case of Cuba is set
forth officially. That document has been
printed by the order of the Senate, and is
appended. In the papers accompanying
this note the delegate stated the causes of
the revolution in Cuba; that it had
reached that stage in which the issue be
tween tbe contending parties 'is in peace
or extermination.' "
"The recent message of the President is
clear on the point that be has been forced
to the same conclusion. The delegate
then stated tbe facts showing tbe prelimi
nary organization of the revolt, the up
rising; the battles and campaign that had
already been fought, including the great
and victorious campaign of Gomez against
Captain-General Campos, which caused
him to be recalled to Spain and be sup
planted by Captain-General Weyler; the
military organization of tlie Cubans; their
civil government; their treatment of pris
oners; that the government here repre
sented is not a negro government; the
character of the war; the protests of resi
dent citizens of the United States in Cuba
against their cruel treatment by the Span
ish forces, that ttieir lives and property be
placed under the special protection of the
Cuban Government, and that they are
exempt from taxes and contributions by
the constitution of the Republic of Cuba
when that Government is recognized by
their respective governments. The letter
of the Cuban delegate, thus addressed to
our Secretary of State, has appended to it
several papers which set forth fully the
grievances complained of by the Cuban
people.
"In its nature it is a declaration of the
independence of the island of Cuba, stat
ing the (.rounds of their united action.
That declaration is in keeping with tbe
historical narrative given by Mr. Benja
min in his speech, herewith presented,
ana with the report of the committee on
foreign relations In 1859, and with the
message of President Grant and President
Hayes and the letters of Mr. Sickles and
Mr. Cuebingas Ministers to Spain, and of
Mr. Fish and Mr. Evarts as Secretaries of
State. All the papers are uniform in their
statements of the wrongs and grievances
of the Cuban people and of the wrongful
and tyrannical cause of Spain toward
them. In none of them is any bad pur
pose imputed. No oiie has contradicted
these statements or any material part of
them on the authority of the Spanish
Government or upon any official or other
credible authority.
"Tbe tenor of the message of the Presi
dent to this session of Congress is a re
affirmation of all this history, stated in all
these papers. In the part of the message
relating to Cuba he uas laid them before
Congress without any special recommend
ation and has left to Congress the duty of
making provision for tne security of the
rights, the property and the lives of our
citizens residing in Cuba and of enforcing
the right of indemnity on behalf of the
legal successors of those who have been
killed there. He has intimated tbat delay
is the wi-est policy, but tie has refrained
from saying that delay is required by our
National honor or by the interests of hu
manity. A comparison of this message
will show that it agrees with the state
ments of every President who has alluded
to the subject, and it further shows that
the same spirit of tyraunical domiuation
now prevails in Cuba that has kept the
people of that island in despairing servi
tude during the entire century.
"The message of Mr. Cleveland, who has
no aversion to Spanish rule in Cuba, con
firms in all important statements the truth
of the charges made and communicated by
Estrada Palma against Spain in the expo
sition of tbe case of Cuba, which he pre
sented to our Secretary of State. The only
difference in the situation in Cuba and aa
it is described in the report of the Senate
committee in 1859 and as it- is described in
the President's message in 1896â thirty-six
years laterâ is tbat as time has progressed
the wrongs of Cuba have been aggravated
and the means of repression employed by
Spain have grown into a war against hu
manity, a war of extermination of the na
tive population. If the firm purpose of
our predecessors to put an end to this con
dition of affairs in Cuba in the compara
tively mild form of tyranny that existed
fifty years ago has degenerated into
doubts and misgiving as to our duty to our
own people and the demands of Christian
tian civilization, let tbe responsibility for
this lapse from the true spirit of the
American liberty and our love of home
rule and independence rest where it justly
belongs and not upon the people, through
the indifference to their will on the part
of their repressntatives in Congress."
"CUBA LIBRE" THEIR CRY.
Patriotic Actf TorfcerÂ» . Demand , the
Recognition of the Insurgent*. , "
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 21âTwo
great ' demonstrations in . favor of "" Caba
took place here to-night. One was a street
parade of the', organization called "the
"Friends of Cuba." The other was a mass
meeting at Cooper Union, called _by tne
Cuban League of the United States. Sev
eral thousand men took part in the street
parade and -many thousand 1 more lined
the sidewalks and cheered all along the
line of march. * ' 'â  1J ' >â¢
The procession formed on East Eighty
sixth and Eighty-seventh streets
and marched by way of Third and Lex
ington avenues and Broadway to Cooper
Union. Franz Meyer, president of the
organization, was grand marshal. The
column was divided into ten battalions.
The American flag was carried at tbe
head of each battalion with two Cuban
soldiers as escort. A large number of
transparencies were carried illustrating
Spanish massacres. One showing the
killing of Maceo, bore the title: "Spain's
Latest Triumph in Murdering Under the
Fiag of Truce."
Other inscriptions were : --Let Congress
Act, the People Will Uphold Congress";
"Americans for Liberty and Facts" ; Re
member Washington and Lafayette";
"Uphold the Monroe Doctrine"; "An
other Star to the Constellation of Repub
lics" ; "For God's Sate Stop the Murder
in Cuba 1" "We Die. but No Surrender";
"Vive Cuba Libre"; "Join the American
Friends of Cuba, Our Object Is to Assist
the Down- trodden Cubans and Keep Spain
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
From Committing Further Assassina
tions."
Cooper Union was packed to the doors,
while the meeting was called to order by
its president, Ethan Allen, descendant of
the general of the same name of revolu
tionary fame. Mr. Allen said;
"This immense and enthusiastic audi
ence is proof that the heart of our citizens
still throbs in harmony fox any people
struggling to be free. Further than this,
it is proof that the American people do
not breathe the air of cowards, although
some of the Government may. We are
assembled to-night to uphold in other
lands the cause for which Washington
and bis compatriots contended in this.
If we are not willing to make sacrifices to
extend the heritage of liberty bequeathed
to ub from the storms of battle, we are un
worthy to hold and enjoy it ourselves.
"Cuba is now for tbe second time in tbe
death grapple with her savage foe. She
is determined to be free; and we are here
to-night to say she shall. The curse of
Spanish rule is no longer to be tolerated.
It is the government tbat admits of no re
ciprocity between the King and subject;
one plays the part of tyrant and all tbe
rest are slaves. Our people revolt against
this wherever it may exist, and especially
when so near our own shores.
"Spain by her revolting cruelties has
forfeited the good opinion of mankind
and is no longer to be regarded as a factor
among civilized nations.
"We assemble here to-night as Ameri
cans to declare tbat the independence of
Cuba shall be recognized now. To delay
is to mske ourselves responsible for the
further ruin and slaughter whicn will fol
low. Cuba has resolved upon freedom or
extermination, and, applauding her heroic
energy, it is our duty to stay the assassin's
hand. With Spain we have tried argu
ment long enough. She is not enabled to
reason, so we must resort to some other
force. The time has come to stop our
talking and to load our guns. We are
animated with the hope that a brighter
day is to dawn upon these struggling
heroes of the Antilles.
"The Cuban Leacue, wbich is here in
augurated, will labor on till from the
Mount Sinai of our own invincible repub
licanism we may thunder our command
so . that Spain shall bear, and hearing
shall obey, 'Let those Cubans go.' "
General Bradley T. Johnson, the next
speaker, criticized the attitude of Presi
dent Cleveland.
Secretary Dr. de Sayas read letters from
Senators Henry Cabot Lodge, John Gor
don. Wilkinson Call, R. Q. Mills, Cullom,
Thomas Dixon Jr. and Governor Morton.
All regretted their inability to be present
and speak for Cuba's cause.
In most part tbe letters roundly con
demned tbe butchery being conducted by
the Spanish soldiers under Weyler.
Secretary de Sayas read a number of let
ters from prominent people giving finan
cial aid to the cause. Among them was
one from W. E. D. Stokes donating $1000.
Mr. Stokes spoke briefly, declaring that

quarter of a century ago conduct a ten years'
war for that purpose, and whereas, they have
for the second time entered upon the bloody
paths of revolution, which they have pursued
for nearly two years, conducting a most heroic
struggle against the tyranny of Spain, and
whereas, the people of the United States can
not regard with indifference a contest so near
their own borders, and which repeats so
closely a part of their own history; tiÂ»erefore
be it
Jtanlved, That iv the catalogue of wrongs
Which distinguish the rule of the "mother
country" over Cuba, we recognize cruelties
which equal the barbarism of the mediaeval
times. Without representation me citizens
of Cuba have bee^i taxed to the verge of pov
erty, the civil courts of Justice have closed and
in their stead established a military despot
ism. Without trial the "native born" have
suffered the decree of banishment, imprison
ment and death. The mere caprice of the
ruler has been appeased by the death
of the enslaved, and even a murmur of
discontent at all this has opened a grave. The
resolution of the Cuban patriots to avenge
these wrongs we fully justify, and their noble
and heroic warfareâ friendless and unarmed
against their well-provided adversary, endur
ing every hardship, shrinking from no sacri
fice, giving their cities to the flames rather
than to the foe â entitles them to the sympathy
and admiration of Christian nations.
Eesolved, That the enormous military and
naval forces of the kingdom of Spain engaged
in Cuba during a period of now nearly two
years has so far failed to reduce the insur
gents, and these insurgents, as we are in
formed by the highest official authority of this
Nation, being as irresistible to-day as when
they first moveo. to combat, and, furthermore,
having meanwhile organized and main
tained a government as perfect and stable
in all its parts as was the Govern
ment of these colonies when Washington
was at Valley Forge; in view of all these
facts, the Cuban republic is entitled to recog
nition forthwith from this Nation â an official
recognition of its independence. Such action
by the United States would be in accordance
with international law, and also in harmony
with the rule enunciated by President Monroe
âthat any attempt on the part of European
powers to enforce their system over any part
of this hemisphere against the will of its peo
ple would be considered by the United States as
dangerous to their peace and liberty. And we
deprecate and condemn that conservatism
which favors monarchy at the expense of re
publicanism, which permits the oppressor to
equlti his armies upon our soil and forbids
this privilege to the oppressed. And if this
conservatism is enforced because of our neu
trality laws, then we call upon our represen
tatives in the councils of the Nation to change
the laws.
V Resolved, That in our j udement he mistakes
the impulses of the American, people who
says: "They view with wonder and admiration
the cheerful resolution with which vast bodies
of men are sent by Spain across thousands of
miles of ocean, that the costly gem of the An
tilles may still hold its place in the Spanish
crown." On the contrary the American peo
ple view with horror this energy of demons,
whose purpose is to continue the robbery and
slaughter of unoffending subjects.
Resolved, That we indignantly repudiate the
idea that our heartless treatment of the Cuban
patriots should be continued, because other
wise difficulties are to be apprehended with
Spain. We have no desire for a contest with
that kinedom nor any other nation. Peace is
our constant aim, except when we become
powerless to maintain it. In the issue now
before us we simply ask that our duty
snail be done, as we are given to see
that duty, according to diviue and human laws.
And determined upon our duty we propose to
do it, though It calls the world to arms. And
while we repudiate any selfish motives by our
efforts on behalf of Cuba, at the same time we
cannot fail to observe that this island is geo
graphically so situated that its liberation from
its European domination would be greatly to
our National advantage. Upon the broad prin
ciples of National safety which govern the
powers of Europe we would be Justified in Its
absolute appropriation, but by that rule of
justice which forbids us to seize territory
against the will of its people, the same rule
of justice which forbids the kingdom of Spain
to enforce her dominion over a resisting
American colony, we can only ask that Cuba
ac a free and independent state shall for her
self determine her own future.
Resolved, That the Cuban League of the
United States, "organized to diffuse the senti
ments and to secure to Cuba by all legal
means the inalienable rights of self-govern
ineLt," will labor on until its mission is ac
complished. And in furtherance of its objects,
we ask that a copy of these resolutions as ex
pressive of the sense of this meeting be for
warded to the representatives of the people in
Congress and in the other branches of the
Government.
MATEO WAS MUROLEED
That Is the Jirw Hrought by Uteamthip
( nptnin From Jiarana.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 2L-"I am
able to say on what I consider the best of
authority that General Maceo was mur
dered and not killed in Honorable war
fare," said Captain Burley of the steam
ship City of Washington, which arrived in
this port from Havana to-day. He said
be obtained the information from a man
of unquestioned honor and veracity.
"I have it from a most reliable source,"
said Captain Burley to a reporter to-day,
"that Maceo was ambushed and assassin
ated. I got my information through a
third party from no less a source than the
telegraph operator at the place. Maceo
was killed at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of
the Bth.
"He was decoyed under the bluffs and
shot. Major Cirnjeda had 350 men in
readiness at Puota Brava. The letter
found on Gomez's son was a base forgery,
for the purpose of misleading sentiment
There were just forty ln tbe Cuban party
with Maceo. It is whispered that two
escaped and that one of these is with Juan
Riviera in the bills. Tbe others were
killed.
"It is from these two that the truth has
come. A Spanish officer told me confi
dentially that Maceo was ambushed. It
was expected that many desertions would
follow tbe news of bis death. Instead the
Cubans bave become doubly detenu ined
and have gained numbers.
"The feeling in Havana is intensely
anti- American among tbe Spanish. Tbe
same Spanish officer told me frankly that
they could and would clean us up at the
first chance.
"Relations are strained in business cir
cles. The wealthy classes are leaving or
have left for Progreso or Vera Cruz,
Mexico.
"In the last few days the expectation of
favorable action tow-rd the Cubans by
tbe United States Senate has intensified
Spanish hatred and Cuban exultation.
"The Spanish in Havana honestly think
they can best us in a war. The truth is
that most of the people in Havana would
welcome a war with the United States as
the quietest settlement of the trouble. It
is a mixture of bombast, commercial
shrewdness and despair."
YANGBILL`S SECOND TRIAL
Ax Usual, the Spanish Authorities
Proceed Illegally.
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 21.â The civil
trial of Julian Sanguilly, , a naturalized
American citizen, on charges of con
spiracy against the Spanish Government,
began at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
There were five Judges on the bench
and Vice Consul-General Springer, who is
HCtin? Consul-General in the absence of
Fitzhu Lee, occupied a seat near the
Justices.
After the usual preliminaries, counsel
for the defense stated that the tribunal
was illegally constituted, since six just
ices should preside and not five, and be
therefore disputed the competency of the
court to hear and decide tbe case.
He claimed that tbe prisoner was en
titled to a trial by six Judges, according to
the law ruling in 1821, when tbe Spanish
protocol was drawn, and that he suoul i
not be tried under the law of 1877. He
made a motion to this effect, but it was
overruled.
The defense announced that it would
later protest against the decision.
The taKing of #vidence then began. The
Chief of Police and an inspector were the
first witnesses. The evidence was favor
able to the accused, they declaring they
had no knowledge of Sant:uilly ever tak
ing part in any demonstration.
The defense protested vigorously against
the reading of testimony given by Colona,
the recently executed prisoner, holding
that its admission in the present trial was
directly contrary to the law. Sangudiy
testified, that he did not write the letters
that were produced in bis former trial to
show his connection with the rebellion.
The letters had been submitted to ex
perts, and they testified that they were
in the handwriting oi the accused. The
prosecuting attorney reviewed the case,
claiming that the evidence was indis
putable; that the prisoner h.d taken an
important part in ttie conspiracy to over
throw the Spanish Government in Cuba.
He skillfully presented all the facts that
could be brought to bear against the ac
cused and Hsked the' court to sentence San
i:uilly to life imprisonment.
The court then adjourned until to
morrow.
La Lucha to-day prints a bitter editorial
on the Cameron resolution. It draws a
parallel between tbe Congresses of 1872
and 1896 and says that both were inspired
by mercenary motives.
DAFARD RELIAFES IN PEACE
Therefore He Will >ot contemplate Any
Possibility of War.
LONDON, E>-0., Dec 2Lâ United States
Embassador Bayard was asked by are
porter of the United Associated Presses
to-day if he sustained tbe views expressed
by Secretary of State Olney in his state
ment concerning Cuba. Mr. Bayard re
plied that he did not wish to > xpress an
opinion in an official capacity, but he
would say that Mr. Olney had only quoted
from the constitution of the United States,
which gives to the Executive sole power
as ex-officio commander-in-chief of the
army and navy and the making of all
Federal appointments.
Mr Bayard was asked what he thought
of the reports received from Madrid, that
the Spanish war officers were preparing a
pamphlet for distribution among the offi
cers of the army and navy containing in
formation as to the strength and general
condition of the coast defenses of the
United States, to which question tbe Em
bassador replied that he was not suffi
ciently acquainted with military and
naval matters to venture an opinion, nor
did he desire to contemplate the possibil
ity of war between the United States and
Spain. The United States, he added, had
great natural protection in the shoals
along her coasts and the condition and
conformation of the entrances to her
largest ports. He did not believe that
there would be war, but that tbe matters
at issue would be settled amicably.
SYMPATHY OF ITALIANS

ROME, Italy, Dec. 21.â 1n the Chamber
of Deputies to-day a member of the
Radical party gave notice of his intention
to introduce a motion expressing the
sympathy of the Chamber of Deputies
with the Cnban insurgents.

intimated that the Ministry would oppose
the adoption of such a motion by the
Chamber, his remarks evosing violent
protests on the part of the Radicals.
In the course of the discussion Signor
Imbriani, the Radical leader, declared
that his party at least would join the
American and other civilized people in
hoping that the Cubans might be victori
ous in their struggle for freedom.

no interference with the sovereignty of
Spain in Cuba, the Pall Mall Gazette says
that Senor Canovas is magnificent in bis

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1896.
ANNUAL REPORT
OF MR. CARLISLE
Interestirg Figures Given
by the Secretary of
the Treasury.
Expenditures of the Government
Are Much in Excess of
the Receipts.
An Argument in F37or of Retiring
United States and Treasury
Notes.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2L-The
annual report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, transmitted to Congress to-day,
deals extensively with the financial situa
tion. Mr. Carlisle summarizes the <on
dition of the treasury and says the issue
and redemption of circulating notes is
not the proper function of the Treasury
Department or any other department of
the Government While the Government
has power to borrow money, it is not its
duty to issue public obi gations merely
for the purpose of providing paper copy
for use \n transaction of business, nor
has it the constitutional power, in his
opinion, to make its promises legal tender
in payment oi private debts.
The Secretary refers to the power in
which the entire financial system has been
placed by the constant agitation of the
currency question, and aiids: "There is
but one absolutely certain way to remove
this delicate and dangeous question from
our party politics and that is to retire and
cancel the notes. We must not be deluded
into a feeling of security by the' fact that
there has been a suspension of gold with
drawals during the past few months."
The Secretary holds that without a ref
ormatian of our currency we cannot safely
reiy upon permanent accessions to our
stock of gold from abroad in settlement of
trade balances in our favor.
Secretary Carlisle shows the revenues of
the Government from all sources to have
been $409475,408, and the expenditures
$434,678,654. wuich leaves a deficit for the
year ended June, 1898. of $25,203,245. In
addition to the ordinary revenues col
lected during the year, the cash in the
treasury was increased by the following
sums:
From the sale of $100,000,000 4 per cent
thirty-year bonds, $111,166,246, and from
tLe issue of 4 per < ent bouds in liquida
tion of interest accrued ou refunding cer
tificates, converted during the year, $4130,
making a total ot $111,170,376.
As compared with tue fiscal year 1895,
the receipts for 1896 increased $19,102,205.
of which the following are th- i rin ipal
iiem^ oi increase: Customs, $7,863,134; in
ternal revenue, $3,341,192; pronts on coin
age, bullion deposited, etc., $1,256,512;
postal S2rvice, $5,516,080.
There is shown to have been a decrease
in the ordinary expenditures of $-1,015,852.
The revenues of the Government lor tiie
current liscal year are thus estimated
upon the oasis of existing laws:
From customs, $148,000,000; from in
ternal revenue, $150,000,000; miscellaneous
sources, $20,000,000; from postal service,
$89,793,120; total estimated revenues,
$407,793,120. The expenditures for the
same period are estimated at $472,293,120,
leaving an estimated deficiency lor the
year of $64,500,000.
Thes estimates of receipts and expendi
tures are made upon the assumption that
there will be no substantial change in ex
isting business conditions and that the
present scale of public expenditures will
not be reduced.
But if our ordinary business activity
should be resumed mi i the consumption
of articles subject vo taxation should in
crease to its normal proportions there
may be in fact no deficiency in our reve
nues.
In his discussion of the currency ques
tion the Secretary makes an exhaustive
argument iv favor of the retirement from
circulation of United States and treasury
notes.
Mr. Carlisle renews his recommendation
made in his report that the Secretary
of the Treasury should be authorized
to issue f.om time to time bonds paya
ble in gold, bearing interest at a
rate not exceeding 3 per cent per
annum and having a long time to run,
and to exchange such bonds for United
States notes and Treasury notes upon
such term" as might be most advantageous
to the Government, or to sell the bonds
abroad for gold whenever in his judgment
it might be advisable to do so, and to use
the gold thus obtained in making re
demptions of outstanding notes. He
gives in detail his reasons for carrying
this plan into effect.
"Whatever plan may be finally adopted
for the retirement of United States notes
and treasury notes," says the secretary,
"it will fail to afford complete protection
to the Government against demands tor
(.old in the future unless it includes relief
frr the treasury from the obligation to re
deem national bans notes, except such as
are worn, mutilated or delated, and the
notes of failed banks, or requires these in
stitutions to keep their 5 per cent re
demption fund in gold and to deposit
gold coin for the withdrawal of bonds
when circulation ia to be surrendered or
reduced."
Secretary Carlisle also renews his
recommendation for sucu amendments to
the National banking laws as would per
mit the issue of circulating notes equal in
amount to the face value of the bonds de
posited, and reduce the tax on notes to
one- fourth of 1 per cent per annum,
and thai authority oe given to establish
branch banks for the transaction of all
kinds of business now allowed, except the
issue of circu ating notes.
On the subject of protection in this con
nection the Secretary says in part:
"So long as the income of the Govern
ment from customs and internal taxes
exceeded its expenditures the fact that
protective duties were destructive of rev
enue, al: hough clearly apparent to all
who observed the practical operation of
the system, aid not attract the attention
of the public generally; but the situ
ation 'has been materially changed
since 1892, and hereafter it will not be
possible to sacrifice revenue to protection
without seriously embarrassing the fiscal
affairs of tne Government by depriving it
of an income sufficient to defray its ex
penditures. If the usual proportion of
this income is hereafter to be derived from
taxes on imported goods, thÂ« protective
theory roust be abandoned as the basis of
our legislation upon t c subject, and a
well considered and consistent revenue
system must be substituted in its place;
and, iv my opinion, this can be done with
out material injury to any trade or indus
try now existing in this country.
TO KEEP UP THE FIGHT.

SESSION OF THE HOUSE
Consideration of the Legislative, Execu
tive and Judicial Kit',
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 21.â The
House spent most of another day's session
this afternoon in the consideration of the
legislative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill and still "came to no resolu
tion ihereon.'' Nearly all of the time was
given to discussing the future control of
the library, whether by the joint commit
tee on the library, as proposed by that
committee in Quigg's substitute, or by
the librarian, as proposed by tue Commit
tee on Appiopriations. The principal
speeches in favor of the Appropriation
Committee's plan was made by Bineham
( li.) of Pennsylvania and Cannon (R.) ol
iilmoisof the committee and by Cum
mmgs(D.) of New York in favor ot the
Quigg substitute. The latter was rejected
â27 to 85.
On motion by bhafroth (Sil.) of Colo
rado the salary of the librarian was re
duced irom $6000 to $5000. On the subject
of the appropriation for the Civil Service

was taken from the Speaker's table and
the Senate's request for a conference on
tbe amendments made by that body
were aarree 1 to. Tbe House conferees are
Bartholdt (R.) of Missouri, Danforth (R.)
of Ohio and Wilson (D.) of South Caro

THREE BANKERS CONVICEED
They Misapplied funds and Wrecked
the Institution.
DENVER, Colo., Dec. 21.â The case of
the Government against Charles H. Dow,
president, Sidney G. McClurken, teller of
the defunct Commercial National Bank,
and Dr. O. E Miller of Chicago, charged
with misapplying funds and defrauJing
the depositors of the wrecked institution,
came to an end late tnis afternoon, the
jury returning a verdict of guilty against
all three of tbe defendants. The trial has
consumed exactly seven days in the Fed
eral court and its progress has been
watched wih interest by the depositors
and bankers in New York and Chicago.
The Commercial National, owing to the
"kiting" of Miller's checks lor a sum ag
gregating $125,000, was forced to suspend
during the great p tnic of 1893. The ver
dict will probably place the convicted
men behind prison bars.
Stockholders liis*ntitjiecl.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Dec. 21.â An effort is be
ing made to bell the remaining seven
eig iteentbs of Woolson Spice Company's

alleged that under the new order of things
tbe value of the stock will depreciate. It
is said that ii tbe minority stockholders
are unable to unload they will attempt to
have a receiver appointed for the com
pany. Little credence is given to the re
port from New York that the Arbuckles
are eventually to get control of the Wool
son plant.

OF INTEREST TO
WAGE-EARNERS
Many Important Matters
Considered by the
Delegates.
Adoption of Resolutions by
Which It Is Hoped to Im
prove Labor Conditions.
Close of the Sxtecnth Annual Ses
sion of the American
Federation.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 21.â The first
matter of importance at the session of the
American Federation of Labor was a reso
lution from the committee on law which
siiut out local trades unions and local fed
eration of labor unions from representa
tion in conventions of the American Fed
eration, with the committee's recom
mendation for its adoption. Attention
was called to the fact that the resolution
would exclude the fishermen, who have
no national organization, and the matter
was referred for further consideration.
The chairman of the special committee
on the Erdman arbitration bill reported
that they had been unable to consult with
the attorney whose advice they desired,
and moved that as there is not now time
left to secure proper legal consideration of
the bill the matter be taken un and dis
posed of. Delegate McÃride moved that
the entire matter be referred to the in
coming executive committee with instruc
tions to eliminate the objectionable fea
ture*, and if that can be done the bill will
be indorsed by the American Federation
of Labor. The motion was carried by an
almost unanimous vote.
A resolution advocating the abolish
ment of the wage system and the estab
lishment of aco-operative commonwealth,
through which it was Hoped to commit
the American Federation of Labor to the
Socialist Labor party, was, upon recom
mendation of the committee on resolu
tions, non-concurred in.
A resolution was passed which in
structs the executive committee to draft
a bill and do all it can to secure its
passage by Congress for the establishment
of a Department of Labor in the National
Government.
A re-oution indorsing the Otey bill
now before Congress met with the ap
proval of the convention.

Former action iavoring election of
United States Senators by direct vote of
the people was reaffirmed.
The executive council was instructed to
present a bill in Congress refusing street
car companies the right to use the words
"U. S. Mail" on their cars.
The Butler bill, now before Congress,
favoring the ownership of all telegraob
and telephone lines in connection with

CHILDREN HONOR McKINLEY
Thousands Turn Out, Wave Flags and
Sing Patriotio Songs.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 21.â This was a
lively day for the Prpsident-elect. His
callers were more numerous than ever,
and about 3 o'clock in the afternoon there
was a demonstration which in character
and magnitude rivaled some of the scenes
witnessed in Canton in the closing days
of the campaign. Seven hundred children
from f-choolÃ on the South Side near where
Major AfcKinley is visiting came shortly
before 3 o'clock to call upon him. The
teachers accompanied the children and
when Major McKinlev appeared on the
porch to bow his acknowledgement the
air rang with cheers and there was a crim
son flash of wavine flags. Nearly all of
the children carried small American flags.
The Girl s' Glee Club from the Hyde Park
School sang "America" and the "Star
Spangled Banner." The cheers and the
fresh young voices lifted in patriotic song
attracted hundreds of adults, and in the
course of fifteen minutes tne visit of the
school children was turned into a big re
ception.
The clamor to see Major McKinley and
shakf hands witb him became so great
that the people were asked to form in line
and walk through tne house. Major Mc-
Kinley let them in the reception room
and they went out a side door. He shook
hands with more than 3(jO0 persons and
this impromptu reception lasted for more
than an hour. A feature of the crowd was
the large number of workingmen. Scores
of them at the sound of the singing and
the cheers left their tasks to go and pay
their respects to the President-elect.
Among Major McKinley's callers to-day
were Charles G. Dawes and several mem
bers of the Illinois delegation in Con
gress.

SHi DAMIANA BITTEIiS. THE
kJ great Mexican Remedy: gives Health and
lUenkUi to tiie Sexual Or*auayCOLLAPSE OF THE
ILLINOIS NATIONAL
Followed by the Failure of
Three Private Banking
Houses.
An Enormous Loan on Very
Poor Security Which Led
to the Suspension.
City and Couuty Funds Tied Up in
the Vaults of the Embarrassed
Institution.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 21.â The closing
of an institution which was considered to
be the second stongest National bank in
Chicago, quickly followed by the failure of
three private banking-houses, which did
business with it, caused a flurry of excite
ment in financial circles to-day and let to
runs on several banks by timid depositors.
A flood of rumors relative to other banks
and business firms added to the intense
nervousness which pervaded all classes of
people long after banking-hours and the
close of the courts.
The banks which were closed follow:
National Bank ot Illinois, capital $1,000,
-000, liabilities $11,000,000; E. S. Dreyer &
Co.. bankers, mortgage brokers and real
estate dealers, liabilities $1,500,000, esti
mated value d assets $1,650,000 ; Wasmans-
dorff <fe Heinemann, bankers and mortgage
brokers, liabilities $416,000, estimated value
oi assets $550,000; .Roseland Savings Bank,
Rose. and, 111., small capital, and assets
- estimated equal to liabilities.
All the private banks that closed their
doors closed through the National Bank
of Illinois, and the big crash compelled
tneir suspension to conserve their assets
and protect creditors. Two private city
Lanks went into liquidation through re
ceivership proceedings in the courts.
Reassuring action was taken at a largely
attended meeting ol the clearing associa
tion, which was held after banking hours
this af'ernoon. The following resolution,
offered by ex-Comptroller of the Currency
Â£. S. Lacey, president of the Bankers' Na
tional Bank, was unanimously adopted;
"That the Clearing-house committee,
after calling to their aid such other per
sons as they may desire, be requested
to formulate a plan which will enable
creditors of the National Bank of Illinois
to avail themselves of the offer of the asso
ciated banks to make advances by way of
loans to said creditors to the extent of 75
per cent upon properly proven claims."
The chairman of the Clearing-house
committee stated that the readiness of the
bankers to do this was so evident tbat it.
was not probable any formal organization
to accomplish the object set forth in the
resolution would be necessary, although
the committee appointed will give prompt
attention to the duty imposed on them.
William F. Dummer, president of the
association and vice-president of the
North western Bank, read the following
telegram which he had received from
Comptroller of Currency Eckels, dated
Washington :
"I have appointed Bank Examiner Me-
Keon temporary receiver of the National
Bank of Illinois and instructed him to
publish notice to creditor* to prove claims.
He informs me that the Clearing-house
committee will advance 75 per cent on
evidence of claims. Notice will be pub
lished at once, and if claims are proven
immediately I shall within thirty days be
abJe to pay a very considerable dividend.
I appreciate the action of the Clearing
house in offering to advance on such
claims."
The decision of the Clearing-house com
mittee to refuse clearing privileges to the |
National Bank of Illinois, and also to re
fuse funds by which the bank could have
gone into voluntary liquidation, was
chiefly due to the astounding discovery
that the bank had loaned $2,400,000 to the
Calumet Electric Street Railway Company
on its bonds as sole security. This loan
exceeded the bank's capital and surplus.
Another account which caused the bank
" ers to hestitate was stated to be near I
$500,000, the debtor being E. S. Dreyer &
Co. Robert Berger, the only partner of
Mr. Dreyer, is a son-in-law of George
Schneider, president of the failed National
bank. There were two other big loans,
which were considered poor collateral.
The necessary sequence to this refusal to
lend aid or to continue clearing privileges
was that' the biÂ«? bank on Dearborn street
failed to open its doors th:s morning for
public purposes. This was anticipated by
the action of the Clearing-house commit
tee, but there was a small knot of anxious
depositors waiting on the marble steps of
the entrance when the big iron screen in
front of the doors rolled up at 9 o'clock to
admit several clerks. At 10 o'clock aca'di
was hung on the grillwork, reading as fol
lows:
"This bank is in the hands of a National
bank examiner, by order of the Comp
troller of the Currency."
This cheerless announcement for de
positors was quickly followed by the post
ing of notices that certain private banics
and business firms would clear through
other banks or pay checks which had been
given Saturday on the suspended insti
tution.
The following private and other banks
mane their clearances through the Illinois
National: E. S. Dreyer & Co.; Farson,
Leach & Co., Garden City Banking and i
Trust Company, Greenbaum Sons, E. K. j
Haas <fc Co., International Bank; Leopold, j
Mayer & Co., Oakland National Bank; |
Oak Park State Bank, Roseland Savings j
Bank, W. G. Stouehton <fc Co.; Wasraans- |
dorff <fc Heinemann, We3t Side Bank; I
Biegel, Cooper & Co.'s Bank, Adams' Ex- i
press Company's Bank, cashier checks on
Drovers' National Banfc.
On the announcement of the Illinois
Bank's suspension from the Clearing
house all the foregoing banks, with the
exception of Dreyer, Farson- Leach, Was
mansdoiff and one other, at once made
other arrangements for clearing. Dreyer
and Wasmansdorff's business passed into
the hands of the Security Title and Trust
Company as receivers. Farson, Leach &
Co. continued to do busiuess and John
Farson, who is president of the Calumet
Electric-street Railroad Company, which
secured the enormous loan from the failed
bank, said there was no necessity or in
tention to do otherwise. He added that |
his house would take care of the Calumet (
Electric through the breakers.
It i* reported tbat the National bank of '
Illinois has about $4,000,000 of its deposits i
of $12,000,000 and there is general confi- i
dence tbat its depositors will be paid in
fulj. The officers and stockholders unite i
in saying so. The last report of the bank
isstied placed the surplus at $11,000,000;
undivided profits $450,000 and total assets,
including bonds, $15,046,992. The attempt
of (he Bank of Illinois to realize on the
Calumet Electric securities aroused the
suspicions of other banks and the investi
gation of the bank's condition by the
Clearing-house committee followed. The
failure was a great surprise to the public.
There was no suspicion on the part of the
large depositors thai the bank's capital
and assets had been seriously impaired.
The heaviest creditors are the municipal
corporations, City Treasurer Adam Wolf
having $650,000 of city funds on deposit
there.
The bank was one of five which are de
positories for city funds, and each of the
banks take turns by the month in cash
ing city checks. It was the failed bank's
turn to pay out in January. Mr. Wolf
said he had no serious concern about the
safety of the city money and has received
ample assurances from the other banks
which holu city money that the corpora
tion will not be embarrassed. City Comp
troller Wetherill, who is also vice-presi
dent of the Globe National Bank, expressed
the utmost confidence in the city's ability
to meet all obligations promptly. He
declared the city was never in better con
dition financially and tbe failure would
not embarrass it in payment of interest
money the first of the year.
The West Park board, of which Carl
Moll, cashier of the failed National Bank,
is a commissioner, has been caught to the
extent of $300,000, and a large amount is
on deposit with E. S. Dreyer, who is treas
urer of the Doard.
County Treasurer D. H. Kochsperger
has $300,000 of county funds tied up in
the National Bank, and Fred M. Blount,
the newly appointed treasurer of the
drainage board, has over $80,000 if dis
trict funds at the bank, whose officers
were on his bonds. The bank officers were
also on the bonds of the city and county
and West Park board treasurers. The
facts tbat these officials were on the bonds
of public officials were strong grounds for
other banks to force a settlement.
At 10 o'clock E. S. Dreyer appeared in
the Superior Court, accompanied by his
lawyer, Levy Mayer, and filed a petition
for the appointment of a receiver. He
made his partner, Robert Berger, de
fendant. The court was told the assets
were $1,500,000 and the liabilities $1,350,
-000; that under the partnership agreement
the business could be closed at any time;
but there was disagreement as to the man
ner in which the concern should be wound
up. Great depreciation in the value of
the real estate holdings of the firm is set
forth in the bill, and the receiver is asked
for to prevent heavy loss. Mr. Dreyer
alleged that his interest exceeds that of
Mr. Berger two to one, and that by a care
ful handling of the estate it can be made
to realize $150,000 more than the liabili
ties. All the allegations were admitted
by Mr. Berger, except that regarding the
.comparative interest of the partners.
On this allowing, Judge Freeman ap
pointed the Security Title and Trust Com
pany receiver for the bank, and its doors
were closed as soon as possible thereafter.
There was no excitement in the crowd
which surrounded the bank building at
Dearborn and Washington streets, and
there was general confidence among the
German depositors that tney would get all
the money due them in a short time.
Dreyer & Co. have been in the banking
business for a score of years, and there is
no more prominent German- American
citizen in Chicago thau Mr. Dreyer.
During all that time the bank has cleared
through the National Bank of Illinois.
The first intimation thai Dreyer & Co. re
ceived that the National bank might not
resume was yesterday, and immediate
steps were taken to protect their interests.
No preferences, direct or indirect, were
given to any one. After the appointment
of the receiver, many generous offers
came from New York and other cities.
Otto Wasmansdorff, senior partner of
the other banking firm, filed the bill for
the appointment of a receiver soon after
the Dreyer proceedings. Judge Freeman
at once granted the petition and named
the Security Title and Trust Company as
receiver, issuing an injunction in both
cases restraining any one interested from
interfering with the assets or receiver.
Wasmansdorff & Heineman stood high
in the community as private bankers.
The firm was established on the West
Side more than twenty-five years ago.
Germans did business chiefly with both
the private banks. The Wasmansdorff
estate will require conservative and cau
tious handling to pay dolls r for dollar.
Of their liabilities about $200,000 is for
savings deposits. Dreyer & Co. had no
savings deposits. The misfortune which
has overtaken both tbe banking firms is
the cause of general regret and sympathy.
Mr. Dreyer came to Chicago more than
thirty years ago from Germany.
The Roseland Savings Bank, which is
situated in the small suburb of Roseland,
near Pullman, peopled largely by Hol
landers, did not open its doors for busi
ness this morning. Fred Wiersma, who
owns the banK, posted a notice that the
bank would not open to-day. The an
nouncement drew a crowd, but there was
no scene of excitement. The depositors,
who are mostly poor people, were assured
they would get tbeir money as soon as
money was received from the National
Bank of Illinois. The bank was estab
lished about two years ago.
Farson, Leach & Co. are the chief own
ers of the Calumet electric road, which is
a new and extensive enterprise, em
bracing several towns southeast from
Sixty-third street. The loan of $2,4Q0,000
obtained from the National Bank was
used to build and equip the road, which is
now in full operation.
Tbe heaviest ran on city banks during
the day was directed at the Garden City
Banking and Trust Company. This with
stood tbe attacc of 200 anxious depositors,
and to-night gave out the statement that
they were thoroughly prepared to pay
everybody who wanted money to-morrow,
although they believed tne worst was
over. The bank has $2,000,000 of deposits,
but the savines department is not large.
There is a large amount of county money
there.
The uneasiness on the part of bankers
and depositors has been aggravated lately
by the numerous failures of building and
loan associations and the exposure of their
financial rottenness.
Lyman J. Gage, president of the First
National Bank, said concerning the Na
tional Bank of Illinois: "It is better that
such an institution should be pushed to
the wall instead of continuing and spread
ing out. If there is one black sheep in
the flock tbat is no indication that all are
the same color. Tbe fact that there is one
liar is not sufficient assurance that we
all are liars. It is true we expected the
election of McKinley would bring good
times and stable financial conditions in
its wake. There is no reason as yet to
doubt that relief. McKinley's adminis
tration, or rather his election, cannot pre
vent results of mismanagement. Nothing
can secure a situation in which bad loans
and bad management are at fault. It
would be unjust to say that the tempor
ary disquiet is confined to 4 all the banks
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1896.
dependent on and clearing through the
National Bank of Illinois, because there
are some sound banks among the number
which survive the ordeal. It cannot be
denied that these failures will have a dis
couraging effect. They cer airily will not
be conducive to any good. There is some
thing eained, however, by the fact that
such an institution is out of the way."
POISONED BY THE WHOLESALE.
Men Who Drank a Peculiar Compound
Used as Whisky Either Died or
Became Insane.
SISTERVILLE, W. Va., Dec. 21.âSix
teen men were poisoned Saturday night
in the Benwood oil field, in Monroe
Zounty, by drinking a substitute for
whisky, and tbe latest reports from there
show that four of the men are dead, two
are maniacs with no hope for their recov
ery and three are in a critical condition.
The remaining victims are seriously ill,
but will probably recover.
The early reports were that the bever
age was a home-made one, of alcohol and
flavors, and sold among the men by ped
dlers. This is not true. It was a common
beveraee, sold in a prohibition commun
ity and composed of alcohol, cinnamon
and suear, put up in two-ounce bottles
and supposed to be diluted with half a
pint of water before using. The liquid
was sold by a local grocer, but the label
does not indicate by whom it was bottled.
That which was sold Saturday evening
was from a newly opened box, and it is
supposed sn error wan made by the per
sons who bottled it. It has not been de
termined what the prison was.
The Monroe County authorities are
making every effort to discover who is to
blame. A post-mortem examination Was
made upon one of the bodies yesterday
and the organs were removed for analysis.
The law provides a very severe penalty for
any person selling a beverage not being
what it purports to be.
Among the dead is William H. Price,
a wealth.? farmer, on. whose farm are oil
wells bringing him in an income of $500
a week. He was not a drinking man,
but had met some friends and took a
drink of the stuff while negotiating an oil
deal.
Charles D. Sibert, a butcher and grocer
doing business at Darden, Ohio, was an
other victim. He was in the oil field,
looking for an investment. The other two
men who died after drinking the liquid
are Thomas Clegg, an oil-well driller, en
gaeed by the Fisher Oil Company and
foreman of that company working the
Benwood field, and Harry Roth, a driller
employed in the field.
Clancy Clegg, a brother of Thomas
Clegg, is in a critical condition, and there is
no hope for his recovery. Henry Boone,
a cook in one of the boarding shanties in
the oil field, drank freely of the liquid and
in half an hour he was insane. He tried
to kill himself and others, and had to be
bound hand and foot. A tramp, whose
name is not known, accepted a treat from
a well-driller and was soon as crazy as
Boone, He is now under restraint and in
a pitiable condition. Three others are
known to be so ill that doctors have no
hopo for their recovery, but their names
are not given.
OVERRULES THE GOVERNOR.
Decision Relating to the Squabble Over
a Bngadiersh'ip in the National
Guard of lowa.
DES MOINES, lowa, Dec 21. â The
lowa National Guard trouble reached a
critical point to-day. John R. Prime,
twice elected brigadier of the First
Brigade and each time counted out by
Adjutant-General Wright, who finally
issued a commission to Colonel James A.
Guest of Burlington, won an important
point. He had applied for a mandamus
to compel Governor Drake and his ad
jutant to issue the commission to him.
The defendants demurred and claimed the
civil court* had no authority over mili
tary elections and tbat an order against
the Governor could not be enforced be
cause he could not pardon himself in case
any penalty were inflicted. The ruling on
this demurrer was handed down to-day.
The court says first that the evidence
shows that Prime was rightfully elected
and counted out; second, that the
Governor must have the commission is
sued to him; third, that the court will en

cannot except himself from liability if he
violates the law. The statute provides
that guardsmen shall elect their own
officers, and to contravene this in one case
is to allow all of them to be appointed
instead of elected. The court concludes
tbat tho commission must be issued. It
is expected the Governor will stand on the
demurrer and appeal. Guest is now in

ALMOST LOST HIS BRIDE.
But the Operation Was Successful and
Kolloc.h Will Be Happy.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 21. -A re
markable courtship will be closed in
Brooklyn to-morrow ni<rht by a romantic
wedding. The bride, a pretty, dark-haired
girl, has jmt been operated upon for ap
pendicitis, and the officiating clergyman
will have to stand by her bedside.
The girl is Frederica Sterling Massey,
the daughter of the late Police Justice
Massey. Her fiance is John K. Kolloch
of Portland, Op., a young man who was
graduated from Armherst College two
years ago. Kolloch went to the West and
settled in Portland, Or. He will probably
arrive in Brooklyn to-day.
The day after the invitation were issued,
about a week ago, Miss Massey became ill
and an operation was decided upon. Dr.
W. L. Bull of New York performed the
operation successfully and the girl is now
recovering. The condition ot the bride
prospective, however, would not allow of
a church wedding, and the invitations
were canceled. The ceremony will be per
formed privately. Kolloch does not know
yet how near be came to losing his bride.

Appear Before the Harbor
Commission.
Declare That Mr. Huntington. Has
Only the People's Welfare
at Heart.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Dec. 21.â The as
semhly room in the Chamber of Com
merce building was packed with people
this forenoon long before the hour for
opening the discussion in the great harbor
contest. Capitalists, bankers, brokers,
manufacturers, wholesale and retail mer
chants and a sprinkling of politicians
made up the crowd of interested specta
tors. The members of the board, headed
by Admiral Walker, its president, filed
into the room a few minutes before 10
o'clock and took seats behind a long tab'e
in one corner of the room.
Promptly at 10 o'clock the president
rapped for order and stated that it had
been agreed among the leaders of the two
factions tbat the speakers for Santa Mon
ica should be heard first; that they would
be obliged to present their case in full, or,
at least, lay the whole groundwork in
their opening statements; that the advo
cates should not be interrupted while ad
dressing the board, but that at the close
of each address questions might be put to
those who had occupied the time of the
board. With this Admiral Walker an
nounced the commission's readiness to
hear the case for Port Los Angeles (Santa
Monica).
Chief Engineer Hood of the Southern
Pacific introduced E. L. Corthell, another
Southern Pacific engineer, who opened
the debate in behalf of Mr. Huntineton's
private harbor scheme. With a huge map
of the coast line, showing both ports in
front of the board, Engineer Corthell be
gan his opening statement. He referred
in a modest way to his labors as an engi
neer in the past and the fact that he had
been before the Senate Committee on
Commerce several times respecting har
bors, breakwaters and marine stations
generally. Two years ago. at the instance
of this Senate committee and President
Huntington, he had visited this coast
with a view of making an impartial inves
tigation of the two ports regarding which
there existed such a wide and apparently
irreconcilable difference of opinion. He
came without prejudice and without any
actual knowledge of the real situation.
His investigation had completely con
verted him to the side of the site where
Mr. Huntington had built his long wharf.
Comparing notes with the Southern Pa
cific, the discovery was made that they
agreed exactly respecting this important
matter, and thereupon President Munt
ington had "retained" the engineer in his
services. In the great contest Mr. Corthell
explained that he (the speaker) had again
been "retained," from which it may be in
ferred that those who shall espouse the
cause of the Southern Pacific in this fight
are neither hirelings nor employes, but
the great "retained."
Owing to his former investigation "in
behalf of ocean commerce," Engineer
Corthell regarded the present as in the
nature of "a personal privilege" in being
permitted to present to a board of fel
low-engineers his opinion of tbe two har
bor sites. The speaker embarked on an
elaborate explanation of the legislative
tribulations regarding these ports, when
he was called to order by Admiral Walker,
who requested him to confine himself to
a discussion of the merits or demerits of
the two ports.
With a bulky roll of typewritten memo
randa the speaker reviewed the history of
marine engineering for several years, and
praised the new or contract system very
highly. He referred to ban Diego, where
the contract system had not been em
ployed and where the original work would
have to be done orer and over again. This
port was, he said, just like San Pedro, in
that the sand would be constantly washed
into the harbor and would of course have
to be as constantly dredged out. He as
serted that it was commerce only which
was sought to be accommodated by this
large expenditure of money â it was not to
be spent for a coast defense. He laid great
stress upon the fact that Port Los Angeies
was so much nearer to San Francisco, from
which point the coast traffic proceeds this
way. He found much encouragement in
the fact that Mr. Huntington's long wharf
had weathered the gales and the undertow
in Santa Monica Bay for three years and
was still there. As to objections to a de
tached harbor, such as was proposed at
Santa Monica, he had found many exam
ples of such harbors both in Europe and
America.
The speaker quoted copiously from
Senator Frye's several speeches in Con
gress on the subject, which had agreed in
a marked decree with his own views. He
took pains to ridicule the people of this
I city and of Southern California generally
for attempting to dictate to Congress in a
matter which concerned the commerce of
the whole world. Summed up, that por
tion of his argument amounted to just
this: "The California public be d â d.""
San Pedro, said Corthell, would do for
local traffic, but never coulu be made to
answer the purposes of general commerce.
The remarkable pitch into deep water at
San Pedro was the cause, the speaker de
clared, of the destructive swells there.
San Pedro was compared to Brito, the
Pacific end of the proposed Nicara: van
canal, with the advantages in favor of the
latter. Santa Monica Bay was extolled
because of its gradual slope into deep
water and for its protection from winds
from every point of the compass. Hesaiv
insurmountable obstacles in the way cÂ±
commerce at San Pedro in the moist lands
and the fact that the terminal railway had
monopoly of the only available space for
railway tracks and docks. Professor
Davidson was quoted in extenso regarding
the sand drift along the coast, which
would soon cover any breakwater at San
Pedro.
President Huntington had agreed, the
speaker said, to supply every facility for
any number of competing lines to his
wharf. He referred to J. M. Crawley of
the Southern Pacific respecting the time
saved as between Santa Monica and San
Pedro on all business from San Francisco,
which was declared to be a full day.
Mr. Corthell referred constantly through
out his long address to various exhibits,
books and charts, which, he reminded the
board, it bad in its possession. He said
if San Pedro was selected Santa Monica
would still do the business anyway.
The engineer finished his address at
noon. Tnen Engineer Hood introduced
Judge K. M. Widoey to speak further
for Santa Monica, but the Judge plea led
a surprise and asked to be excused at that
time. Then ex-Senator Cole, who has
several broad acres near Santa Monica,
was introduced and at once challanged
Engineer Corthell's statement respecting
the people of Los Angeles. The Senator
said tnis fight was the concern of the
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
people here more largely than anywii^re
else, and he rapped the Chamber of Com
merce over the knuckies for espousing San
Pedro's cause, stating if that port were
selected the commerce through it would
go out through the Santa Ana and San
Gorgonio canyons to the East and thus
leave Los Angeles "side tracked." Tne Sen
ator was growinc: eloquent on this point
when Admiral Walker reminded him that
these were matters which the board could
not consider. The speaker then assailed
what he called "Wilmington Harbor,"
and said the awtul sou'easters, which
mariners on this coast so much dreaded,
had a clear sweep into this bay. The San
Pedro ana Cahueuga mountaing, he de
clared, were a complete protection for
Santa Monica Bay.
Engineer Hood here got restless, called
the Senator down and took the floor him
self. Hood ridicuied the whole proceed
ings as uncalled for, and said that he was
astounded when he heard that this learned
board proposed to hear all tbat might be
said on this subject. He would have done
it differently â how he did not say. He
said that ''we" had tried San Pedro to
"our" heart's content and had given up;
had started a wharf and spent much
money, but discovering that no good could
come of it had quit and called off "our"
men. Later he had fortunately 3. und this
lovely, placid cove in Santa Monica Bay
snd had constructed the treat wharf,
which, witnout protection of any kmd,
promised to stand for ages.
The time for adjournment arrived while
Hood was talking and the board promised
to listen to his conclusion to-morrow,
when he will be followed by other "re
tained" gentlemen of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company.

UTAH`S ELECTION
DECLARED VALID
Unanimous Opinion Handed
Down by the Supreme
Court.
0 ficers Chosen by Ballot on No
vember 3 Are Entitled
to Seats.
The Act Regulating Elections in the
State He.d to Be Consti
tutional.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec 2L-The Su
preme Court of this State this afternoon
handed down a unanimous opinion sus
taining the validity of the late election in
Utah. The election was contested princi
pally on the grounds that the acts of tbe
Legislature regulating elections had not
been properly passed, for the reason that
the minutes of the legislative bodies did
not show tbat they had been passed by an
aye and no vote; also that the acts were
unconstitutional becauss they did not
fully conform to the State constitution in
regard to tbe lorm of the Australian secret
ballot system under which the election
was held, and that the use of party em
blems on the ballots was illegal.
The court held that tbe enrolled bills
signed by the presidents of both bouses
and the Governor was the best evidence
that they had been properly enacted;
tbat the ballot system was secret, the
method providing for tracing ballots be
ing only applicable to fraudulent ballots,
and that party emblems on ballots were
proper. The decision is a most important
one. If the court had held otherwise
Utah would have lost her Presidential
vote, had no Representative in Congress,
only one United States Senator, no State
Legislature and the county officers elected
would have won a futile victory.

CHOSE TO BEG
UNTIL HE DIED
Owner of the Blanca Mine
Expires in a Lowly
Hovel.
Among His Effects Is Found an
Offer of $50,000 ?or the
Property.
With Wealth at His Command, He
Succumbs to Exposure and
Starvation.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 21.â A queer
character died at Guaymas, Sonora, on
Saturday. His name was O. White and
he is believed to have been a native of
New York State. His age was about 56
years. The old man seemed to be in the
most abject poverty and went around the
streets ot the Mexican town begging food
and frequently eating refuse found at the
rear doors of restaurants.
White was a miner and occasionally dis
appeared from Guaymas, taking long pros
pecting trips into the mountains. He was
never molested by Mexicans or Indiads,
his shabby outfit saving him from all
queries. The old man was quite well
known to several Americans, who found
him unusually bright and keen in some
respects, especially in money matters,
though he always protested that he was
miserably poor.
In mining, too, he was shrewd and
practical, but he never seemed to find
anything good, and apparently was forced
to return to Guaymas to beg.
i During the recent storm the old man
suffered ereat privation, his shanty ad
mitting wind and rain, and his wretched
straw pallet not serving to keep his old
blood warm. He contracted pneumonia
and died in tne hovel. One or two of his
kind-Dearted countrymen heard of it and
visited the place.
His body had already been taken away
by the health authorities, who are very
Btrict in demanding burial within twenty
four hours, in order to insure against pes
tilence. The Americans searched through
an old wallet to fin J some clew io White's
identity, and came across a letter from a
Boston firm, offering him $50,000 in cash
for his mine, the B.anca, situated twenty
five leagues from Sahuaripe.
This led to an investigation, and it was
found that White had secretly discovered
a very rich mine in his prospecting, and
had developed it to such an extent that
its value was fully demonstrated. An ex
pert visiting the district had inspected it,
and this led to the offer from the Boston
people. The old man had evidently re
fused the offer, as the letter was dated
some months ago and the title still re
mained iv his name.
Not a cent was found in the shanty,
and the old man's body was burried at
public expense. He had no relatives so
far as known.
BUFFETED BY WIND AND WAVE.
Steamship Manzanilio Encounters a Gale
and Reaches Salina Cruz Badly
Disabled.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 21.â The
steamer Manzanillo of Mazatlan was al
most wrecked in a gale off the port of
Salina Cruz some days ago. The Macza
niilo was on its way to Salina Cruz and en
countered roueh weather when over 100
miles north of that port. It had been sent
on a hurried trip and neglected to take on
any more coal than was necessary to sim
ply carry it to Salina Crrz, where the
supply was to be replenished. Owing to
the storm the Manzanillo was delayed,
and spent two or three days in buffeting
head winds and high cross seas that
threatened to engulf it.
in this plight, when the storm was at
its height, part of the machinery became
disabled and rendered the Manzanillo
almost helpless. The chief engineer and
his assistants worked with great ingenu
ity and patched up the machinery so that
slow progress could be made and, the
wind changing, the steamer kept on to
ward Salina Cruz.
During a sudden squall at the end of the
storm the smokestack was toppled over,
and before it could be secured it was
washed overboard. This complicated the
dangers. All on board expettid to be lost
and implored the captain to order out the
small boats, but he found the storm
abating and decided to stick to the
steamer. A jurystack was rigged, and
with low fires and badly working ma
chinery the Manzanillo reached the port
of Salina Cruz. On the last few miles of
tnÂ« trip everything available on board in
the way of fuel was used, including a lot
of extra spars. To crown the misfortunes
of the trip the steamer becara â¢ unmanage
able on account of the fires going down
and failed to answer to the helm. The

EVENTS AT SAN JOSE.
Southern Pacific Practically Wins a Dam
age SuitâSuicide Kelly's Will
Contested.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 21.â A decision
was rendered this moruing in the suit of
Marshal Band against the Southern Pa
cific Company, the deiendant practically
winning the case, as judgment was given
in favor of the plaintiff forsloo, which was
all that the railroad company offered to
pay lor the damages sustained before the
commencement of the action.
Bond is a wealthy resident of . Santa
Clara who was a passenger on one of the
trains that encountered a flood near Baden
last winter. Bond had his trunk and
some valises with him at the time and
they were checked to Santa Clara upon
his commutation ticket.
In the wreck that followed the washing
away of the track the baggage was lost.
He had valuable property in the trunK
and valises which he estimated to be
worth $415 35. He made a demand on the
company for indemnity to that amount,
and the company cited a clause in the
condition of the tickets issued limiting
the liability of the company in considera
tion of the reduced rate at which the ticket
was sold to only $100 upon any baggage
that would be checked Hnd transported
npon the ticket. An action was broueht
by Bond to recover the full value of the
lost goods.
In rendering the decision this morning,
Judge Reynolds stated that the company
was not liable beyond the amount stated
in the conditions, which were tacitly
agreed to by tne plaintiff by his accept
ance of the same, and there was ample
consideration for it in the sale of the
ticket at a reduced rate.
ROBING IS PENT-DESTROYENS
Interesting Experiment to Be Conducted
by a Santa Clara Farmer.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 21.â Experiments
that will be closely watched by fruit
growers were begun this morning by
Joshua Cozzens, un orchardist on the
Kirk road, wno propose? to ascertain to
what extent robins help in destroying in
sects injurious to trees and vines. The
first experiment will be made with the
peach root borer, a pest which has given
the orchardists more trouble and entails
more expense than any other horticul
tural infliction in the community.
Mr. Cozzens will first dig the earth
from around the trees and the birds will
be given the first chance at the grubs.
After the robins have done what they can
his men will follow and dig out the re
mainder in the usual manner. It so
happens that the robins appear in force at
the same time that the work of dig
ging out the borers is due, and it is
thought by Mr. Cozzens that nature has
ordered this coincidence for some pur
pose. His experience will be of value to
the fruit-growing interests.
KELLY'S WILL CONTESTED.
Action Brought by the Wife Whom He
Attempted to Murder.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 21.â Mrs. Annie
Kelly, widow of John P. Kelly, the jeweler
who attempted to kill his wife and then
fatally shot himself, on November 28,
to-day filed a contest in the Superior
Court to the will of the deceased, filed by
John F. Haley. While lying in the Re
ceiving Hospital Kelly made a will, in
which he disposed of his property, valued
at about $5000, to his two small children,
totally ignoring his wife, who was also be
lieved to be in a dying condition. Kelly
lived for ten days, and although the re
covery of his wife was certain he never
changed his will. Haley was named as
executor.
In the complaint it is alleged that Kelly
was not of sound and disposing mind
when the will was made and that he never
executed it, nor was it legally attested.
It is said that a son of Kelly by a
former wife, now residing in JSan Diego,
will also enter a contest.

Th* Geneva Hrached at Eureka.
EUREKA, Cal., Dec. 21â The brig
Geneva, recently towed to Eureka from
San Francisco to load redwood for Sydney,
had to be beached to-day to keep it from
sinking at the wharf because of a leak in
the rudder casing. The vessel was on the
drydock in San Francisco just before
starting for Eureka, but evidently that
part of the hull was not thoroughly ex
amined, for the leak did not develop till
the vess' 1 was well down in the water
with 270,000 feet of heavy lumber in it
hold. It is believed repairs car* be made
without discharging the lumber now in
the hold, in which case the veÂ«sel will be
detained on:y about three days. It was to
have finished loading Thursday.

LEFT HIS WIFE
FOR AN ACTRESS
Chicago Capitalist Claims
He Suffered From an
Hallucination.
Returns to Home and Family
After a Strange Absencs
of Two Years.
His Explanatory Tale Contradicted by
the Woman With Whom
He Eloped.
POBTLAND, Ob., Dec. 2Lâ Early iv
October the local police were requested to
make search for Cornelius V. Kolliston,
about 45 years old, employed in and about
Warrendale for several months, and whose
few friends were distressed over his dis
appearance. Kolliston had been oscillat
ing between this city and Astoria for
almost ten months, and although a com
mon laborer, when not at work he asso
ciated with a superior class of men. He
was a mystery to those even who im
agined they intimately knew him, for his
languaee, manners and habits were those
of a well-bred man, whicn was somewhat
incongruous to his station in life. This
anomaly gave rise to occasional comment
During tlJe last week in September ne
left Warrendale with $400 in gold coin,
purposing to visit a friend here. Detec
tive Welsh a week later ascertained that
Kolliston bad gone to Chicago. Personal
curiosity led him to inquire about this
man's career tnrougn a private detective,
a personal friend, in Chicago. An answer
came yesterduy.
Kolliston was a well-to-do furniture
maker in West Chicago up to the early
part of August, 1894, when be disappeared
from that city. At that time he owned a
factory and other valuable property unin
cumbered. At first foul play was feared,
but when it was learned that on the day
he disappeared he had drawn all his ready
caÂ«h from a bank of deposit another con
struction was placed upon the motive for
his disappearance by some of his most in
timate friends. Their conjectures were
never communicated to Mrs. Kolliston.
"Kolliston made his reappearance at his
home on the 20th of October," writes De
tective Welsh's friend. "From what I can
learn he represented to his wife that when
he left Chicago he was suffering under a
strange mental hallucination, which was
bis constant companion up to the day he
left Oregon for home. During all of that
time he believed himself to be some one
else, and never for a moment bad he the
will power to concentrate his mind upon
what he had left behind him.
"This story was briefly handled in one
of the Cnicaeo papers," continued the
writer, "which gave rise to an unpleasant
seqnel, Ada Reviere, a dashing variety
actress, being the principal. Last Sunday
she called on Kolliston at his home, de
mandins $5000 from him, eJse she would
expose the true motive of taking him
from his family in 1894."
The writer inclosed a picture of Miss
Reviere, which is identified as that of
Susie May bell, who created a furor at
John Cort's Standard Theater here six
years ago. Continuing the letter says:
"Being unable to intimidate Kolliston
Miss Reviere told Mrs. Kolliston that he
left Chicago in her company in 1894, going
to San Francisco. Subsequently they went
to Portland. After he had squandered
his last dollar she returned East. This
woman accounts for Kulliston remaining
away from home so unnecessarily long
and 'working as a common laborer on the
basis of lending his story a more truthful
flavor."
The letter says, in conclusion, that if
the treacherous variety actress can prove
her assertion, and Mrs- Kolliston will pay
her well if she succeeds, a sensational di
vorce suit will follow, involving about
1250,000.
MOURNING IN SANTA CRUZ.
Death of G. B. V. Deiamater Removes
One of the Seaside City's Early
Pioneers.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec. 2Lâ Profound
regret is felt in Santa Cruz over the death
of one of its pioneers, G. B. V. Deiamater,
in San Francisco on Saturday. He repre
sented the best type of the pioneerâ one
of those who brought, besides the strength
and ambition of energetic young man
hood, a standard of moral rectitude and
the impulses ol an intelligent and patri
otic citizenship.*
In the early 60' s Mr. Deiamater was a
mercnant in Sacramento, a friend and
associate of Stanford, Crocker, Hopkins
and Huntington, tho "Jbig Four" wno
afterward built the Central and Southern
Pacific systems. When the railroad
scheme was in its incipient stage Mr. De
iamater was strongly urged to go into it.
At that time he couid command more
ready capital than any one of the four
wno afterward became multi-millionaires,
but he refrained from investing in the
monopoiy, and always felt proud of his
actions in this respect.
Just as the transcontinental railroad
was completed he came to Santa Cruz and
built a store wtiich to-day, after twenty
five years of service, is the best business
house in this city. In 1881 he built a
mansion on Ocean View avenue, planning
it lor his final and permanent home, but
gossipers circulated the report that he was
withdrawing money from his business for
the residence and certain creditors made
sudden demands for payment, which
couid not be met immediately. Mr.
Deiamater was supersensitive, and in
stead of asking for any extensions or con
cessions he *oid his property at a ruinous
sacrifice, paid every doilirof his indebted
ness and retired front business. Soon
afterward he entered the supply depart
ment of the Southern Pacific, and al
though the family home was retained
here, his citizenship was transferred to
San Francisco, to the ions of Santa Cruz.

Goes Cown.

lision occurred about 11 o'clock this morn
ing on the Sacramento River letweeo *he
steamers Modoc and D. E. Knight. The

A he.ivy fog hung over the river all the
morning. The two boats met a short dis
tance below the city. The Jslodoc was en
route to San Francisco aud the D. E.,
Knight was bound up siream, having a
barge in tow. Both were on the east side
of the river. Captain Fouratt of the Modoc
gave the proper signal and turned into
the stream. For some reason the Knight
also took to the stream and began to crosa
the Modoc's bows;
Captain Fouratt saw that a collision
was inevitable, but before the Modoc
could be stopi el or its course changed
it struck the Knight amidships, almost
cutting it in two.
After the steamers separated the Knight
began to drift down the stream, filling
rapidly. The Modoc at once went to the
reacue and succeeded in pushing the
Knight over to the west shore before it
struck the bottom. It now lies in the
mud half submerged.
The Modoc toofc several hundred sacks
of potatoes and other cargo off the Knight
ana returned with the crew of the sunken
steamer to this city. Tiie Modoc was not
materially damaged and left soon for San
Francisco. The damaee to the Knight is
estimated at $15,000. Captain Price stated
that it would be raised and repaired.

a few-years. It is dangerous to treat this symptom with indifference, to suppose that
it means nothing. It m ans a great deal. It is the forewarning of complete exhaus-

mental, physical or sexual powers. It means that you are Deginning to fail, and swift
is the course of destruction once started. . Like the serpent's warning, it should urge
prompt action. Effective means of checkine the waste and restoring the power lost
can be found in electricity. Vital force, animal magnetism, is infused into the failing
nerves and organs from DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT. There are thousands of
vigorous men to-day who owe their recovery solely to Dr. Sanden's Belt. Ii gives
steady, soothing currents of electricity into the weak parts, reviving the vital powers
and restoring a healthy and vigorous manhood. \ . -

AT THE THEATERS
The Frawley Company in
"The Railroad of
Love."
Twj Ballets Given Simultane
ously on the Orpheum
Stage.
"She" at the Grand Opera-House
With Fine Scenic Effect.
Tre Alcazar.
A warm welcome was given the Frawley
Company lest nigot on their return to the
Columbia Theater for the holiday season.
The play they appeared in was Augustin
Daly's adaptation from the German "The
. Railroad of Love," which has been played
here by the Daly troupe. The Frawleys
essayed it for the first time, and it will no
duubt be added to the successes of their
repertoire, for "The Railroad of Luve" is
one of the bright, light society comedies
in which the company is especially at
home.
The fan of the play centers round
several love complications caused by the
eagerness of fathers and cousins of the
interested parties to hay.- a finger in their
matrimonial pie. Mrs. Valentine Osprey,
a fascinating widow, has a cousin, Phoenix
Scuttleby, who will come in for her for
tune if she remarries.
The object of Phoenix's life is to marry
off "Cousin Val," and in his desire to
acnieve this end he does not even wait to
see whether possible admirers nave wives
of their owh. Viva Van Riker is a young
lady whose father seems almost as anxious
to dispose of her as Phoenix is to dispose
of his fair cousin, and as the course
of true love never runs smooth,
Lieutenant Everett, the husband de
signed for Viva, falls in love with "Cousin
Val," and Viva lavishes her affections on
Benny Pemarasq, a young man whom the
Judge is finally prevailed upon to accept
for a son-in-law as a last resource.
Miss Blanche Bates played Cousin Val
with her usual spirit and vivacity, but
not in her usual style, for during her ab
sence in Honolulu this sparkling actress
has taken on a mosi singular resemblance
to Maxine Elliott in the way that she
â peaks and talks and looks at people.
it may have been an accidental resemb
lance, but there were times when the in
flections of Miss Bates' voice were identi
cal with those of Miss Elliott's voice, and
she certainly iooKed at her lover witii the
poise of ihe head and the upward glance
so much affected by toe fair Maxine.
However, Miss Bates acied with more vi
vacity than Miss Elliott is probably capa
ble of assuming.
Frank Worthing made an impassioned
lover as Lieutenant Everett. The scene
in which he and Cousin Val make love
through a half-open door was particularly
well acted. The lady being en dishabille
was thÂ» reason sue alleged for not coming
out into tne open.
Daniel Frawley played Benny Demar
asq. the swain whom Judge Van Ryker
rejected for a son-in-law, till Viva made
her father change his mind. Frawley has
not change! in his acting â ha seldom
does change â but he gave a manly, un
affected inrerpretntion of lia part.
Harry Corsen Clarke j rovitied a good
deal of amusement as Phoenix Scuttleby,
who meddled matrimonially in his
cousin's affairs. His own little love affair
with a sportive widow was also the cause
of much hilarity. Miss Phosa McAllister
play -d tne widow in her usual clever
manner.
M:ss Hope Ross, who goes on steadily
improving, was E7a Van Ryker and Wil
son Enos payed the part of the Judte.
Maclyn Arbuckle had scarcely a part com
mensurate with his talents, but what tie
had to do he did well. The rest of the
caste was satisfactory.
A good deal of amusement was caused
by a large bunch of mistletoe suspended
in the foyer of the Colombia Theater.
It did not serve for anything save senti
ment, but people laughed as they passed
it by. At the conclusion of "The Railroad
of Love," Nelson H. PrimuÂ»' painting,
"Christ Before Pilate," was exhibited on
the stage.
The Baldwin.
The adventures of the Brownies by land and
sea, as depicted on the stage at the Baldwin,
affords an opportunity for the display of
gorgeous scenic effects. The visions of fairy
land delight the young people and minister to
tne pleasure of the adults. The extravaganza
is on for !he holidays, and promises to sustain
throughout the season the public interest
mf-iiifested in the first performances. The
topical songs last night were applauded, and
the singers recalled. Tbe scenes of the closing
act Introducing t;ie marvelous flying sprites
have captured the fancy 01 playgoers.
The brownies remain iv San Francisco
uniil January 3. They will be succeeded at
the BalJw.n by Joshua Wiutcomb in "The Old
Homestead."
"She" at the Grand.
The initial performance of "She" filled Mo
rosco's Grand Opera-house last night, proving
that Rider Haggard's most famous story has
not grown threadbare with age.
The piece was splendidly staged and the
tcenery grand, especially the scene In the pro
logue of the ancient city of Kor, lying in a
rnar<hy country, through which a silvery
' Btre am threads its way.
In tiie background is a volcano belching up
clouds of flame and smoke. In a burst of
tnunder the mountain rips open and ihe city
disappears in the chasm.
The view of the plain, the African head of
stone and the cnve of the "Fire of Life" are
triumphs in spectacular effects.
She, Queen of Kor, "who must be obeyed."
is played by Miss Cory Mtcey, a soft-spoken
young lady, but she bundles herself up in
veils and draperies so completely that one
wonders if she is reaily as youthful and beauii
ful f.s the novelist has written her to be.
Victory Bateman as Ustane, who is more
classically garbed than the Queen, play* tier
sad roie quite feelingly. Howard Kyie as Kal
likrates and Frank Hatch as Horace Holly are
good. The piece will be played all the week'
with a special matinee Christmas day.
At the Orpheum.
Christmas week is being- celebrated at the
Orpheum by a grand double ballet, with so
many coryphees that the requirements of the
stage are taxed to accommodate them all.
The ballet scene opens with the entrance of
Kiralfy's dancers, <-ver forty In number, who
are gorgeously arrayed in semi-Oriental ros
tumes and in AmÂ«zou dress. They commence
with a dance, which Is very effective, and will
no doubt be more so with a few days' practice
to make the leaders more sure of their cues.
The Dunbar sistera, who have become les Mes
demoiselles Dunbar for the occasion, are the
premieres, and, truth to tell, they are not quite
up to the pretensions of a grand opera ballet.
â¢'The Dying Butterfly" is a dance In the Loie
Fuller style, in which all thÂ« latest and most
fashionable shades of color are projected on a
dmcer, with draperies waving to represent
wines. Jtnanese patterns and butterfly de
gigns are also used very effeciively In this
dunce. Nilsson's aerial ballet, which follows,
is very pretty, for care seems to have been
taken to avoid a pendulum effect, and when
the butterfly designs are thrown on the flying
dancers, they wave their draperies in a way
that really simulates wings. The display con
cludes with a graud finale in which Kiraliy's
ballet and the aerial ballet combine, and, as a
curtain call, the coryphees form a tableau and
ling "I Love You." Most of the dancers are
young and pretty, and the color and light dis
plays in the two ballets are very gorgeous.
The rest of the programme is of the usual
variety order. Zazelle and Vernou, two new
comers, do a good acrobatic comedy act, in
which they mnke plenty of fun while showing
themselves to be skilled gymnasts. Joseph
Pnoite's pantomime company is continuing
ts clever work of last week, and Galetti's
J. A NDERSON, Who Has Discovered a Rich Gold Mine in This
Gty and Doesn't Know What to Do About It.
monfceys,. Clermont's animals and Cushman
and Holcombe complete an exceptionally
strong bill.
The Alcazar.
The Alcazar openrd Christmas week with
Dickens' pretty old story of "The Cricket on
the Hearth" and a fairy scene in marches and
picture ballet.
The principal characters were Mr. Tackel
ton, the toymaker, by Francis Powers, and
Caleb Plumtner. his man. by George Osborne,
and they were exceedingly well played. Mrs.
Bate 3 was an Ideal nurse as Tilly Slowboy, and
dandled her dumb baby in approved style.
Tne dnnce by Hugo Toland and Baby Lewis
I in the pretty dream dance was a pleasing fea
ture, and the lullaby song ot little Nina Cook
I was plaintively rendered. The thirty little
! girls went through their marching very
creditably, but they were so flistreEsineLy
dressed that one was tempted to get up on me
stage ana try to pull up their wrinkled stock
ings and otherwise "fix" their clothing. A
little attention to their costumes will make
the play more attractive. It will be given all
the week.
Tivoli Opera-House.
The Christmas spectacle, "Jack and the
Beanstalk," is drawing large houses at the
Tivoli. The performance is a brilliant one,
and the piece bristles with fun and bright
music. Everything is going very smoothly,
and, allowing for the encores, it is over about
11 o'clock. 1 here will be a special Christmas
day matinee of "Jack and the Beanstalk."
At the Chutes.
The aniinatoscope, shown nightly every fif
teen minutes at the foot of the lake, is one of
the best attractions yet obtained by the
Chutes. The scenes embrace a wide variety
of subjects, including n lady and gentleman
JeetJiijg doves, the New York fire department
in operation, a nurse washing a baby, vitw of
Market street, with cars passing and ropass
ing, and a fishing scene fuli of life and action.
Jules X rto, an equilibrist, introduces a new
act by walking down the chutes on a globe
every night.
Master of the Horse.
Professor O. R. Gleason, the celebrated horse
trainer, gave an exhibition of his power over
several unruly animals before a good house at
the People's Palace last evening.
The circular place in the ceiuer of the build
ing had been sawdusted, and there the pro
fessor successfully bandied a number of erratic
animals.
Under his manipulation they became per
fectly gentle, and were driven around guided
only "by his voice.
ALL FOR THE MONUMENT
The Caledonians Seem to Be
Ail of One Mind on
the Subject.
Photographs cf Famous Statuary
in All Parts of the World
Being Collected.
The monument to Robert Burns pro
posed by the Caledonian Clab is not
likely to want for enthusiastic champions.
The meeting at which the Droject will be
formally decided upon cr rejected by the
Caledonians will not take place until the
first week in January, but in the mean
time a number of active members of the
club are busily at work in preliminary
matters, confident that the club will be a
unit in favor of the undertaking.
Chief Ranger McNeill is sending to all
parts of the country where there are
monuments to Burns in an effort to secure
a collection of them with statements of
cost to present at the meeting. One of
the handsomest Burns monuments in
this country is said to beat Albany, N. V.,
and to have cost about $20,000.
Mr. McNeill said yesterday: "As to the
mop.ey, I do not believe there will be any
great difficulty in raising it. It should be
understood that all the money need not
be raised and in hand, or even pledged,
before starting with this work. If we
raise $SCOO it is good for a start, and a
guarantee for the balance. The revenue
from the annual gathering and games
might start the fund, and other entertain
ments coulil be given from time to time.
There is plenty of talent that could be en
listed at any time in such a cause. Still I
do not want to say too much or to assume
too much responsibility in this matter.
It is for the club to say what it will do,
and I only get my cue from the sugges
tions of a number of the members with
whom I have talked on the subject."
Ex-Chief of the Caledonians Colin M.
Boyd said yesterday: "1 suggested the
idea of a Burns monument when I
was chief of the club, some fourteen years
ago. It met with a strong support at that
time and many offers of contributions
were made. .because of objections to
placing it in the park the project was al
lowed to die at that time. Since then,
however, those objections seem to have
been borne down and a number of monu
ments have been placed there. I see that
our German fellow-citizens are talking
now about putting up a statue to Goethe
and Schiller. I have great faith in Chief
Ranger McNeill's ability to carry the plan
through, but I have no suggestions to
make at this time as to details except to
say that the undertaking is one that
should be approached with great care.
The first steps are those which will tell
most for success or failure.
â¢"The project must be given into the
charge of a committee that will command
the confidence of the community. With
the work thus pioperly begun it will cer
tainly go on to completion in a manner
which will be gratifying to every citizen."
George Davidson is enthusiastic in the
matter. In talking of the matter yester
day he said that ail Scottish clans and in
THE SAN FRACISTISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1896.
dividuals, for that matter, were pieesed
with ih idea, and he was certain could
be depended upon to aid in it in every
way. He had no doubt that the $25,000,
which he thought would be nece-sary,
could be raised.
Robert Dickson was in favor of the
movement, but feared that until the good
times, which he thinks are due next
spring, too much should not be expected
oi it.
On the whole tbe monument idea is
gaining ground rapidly.
SUPERIOR COURT CHANGES.
Trannfers of Calendar* at the New City
Hall Next Month.
Several changes in the courtrooms of the
Judges of the Superior Court will take
place at tbe new City Hall on the incom
ing of the two newly elected Judges,
Carroll Cook and Frank H. Dunne, on the
4th of next month. In accordance with
custom, the junior Judges will be assigned
to departments where criminal cases are
on trial, and for this reason Judge Cook
will take the courtroom and calendar of
Judge Babrs.
Judge Belcher will taice the courtroom
and calendar of Judge Sanderson, who is
to retire from the bench. Judge Murphy
is also to retire and his courtroom will be
taken by Judge Tmutt.
Judge Bahrs will fall heir to Judge
Murphy's calendar and court number, and
will move upstairs to Judge Troutt'a
courtroom, as it is much brighter and
sunnier than the old rooms of Department
12.
Judge Dunne on ascending the bench
will take the calendar and courtroom left
by Judge Belcher, when he goes to take
charge of Jud^e Sanderson's civil calen
dar.
In accordance with custom, tbe senior
Judge who has not vtt heid the position of
Presiding Judge will be chosen to til that
nlace, and in 1897 the honor will tall Oil
Judge Seawell of Department 1.
GEORGE McMILLAN, Captain of the Butte Team.
The Butte football players are expected to arrive in this City to-morrow morning
or possibly late to-night. They are traveling in a special private car, and are coming
directly tbrougn from Montana. On Christmas day, as first mentioned some time
since in The Call, they will meet the Olympic team in a match game at Central
Part.
The personnel of the eleven is little different from that of the Butte team of last
year that easily defeated Olympic, but had to lower its colors to the then more for
midable Reliance team. Tbe Butte players are big men, some of them, at least, but it
is a mistake to believe the assertions that tbe team averages 190 pounds to the man
stripped. It is not nearly so heavy as reports state. Butte baa had a season of unin
terrupted victories, the strongest opposing team having been probably that of tbe
Denver Athletic Club, which was easily disposed of. Its numerous victories, though
some were over colleges of tbe Missouri Valley, do not necessarily indicate that Butte
is invincible, for it is safe to aay that none of the teams were equal to the beat elevens
here.
Bacic of tbe line Butte has Laswell or Hartzell, the heavy piledriver line buckers,
for fullback; McMillan, the old Stanford and Reliance player, for one half, and Gillis,
tbe speedy runner, or either Laswell or Hartzeil for the other half, and Benson, the
old Berkeley captain, for quarter. In the line are about the same men as last year,
except a Dig fellow named Hall, who used in other days to play guard for Princeton.
The acquisition of this Varsity man, who has himself been a coach, and the addition
of Benson should have, together with McMillan's coaching in interference, given the
Butte team what it most Jacked last year to go with its hard, heavy, terrific style of
play. If team work and kicking have been perfected, Butte should indeed be a
formidaoie team.
HOPELESS CASE OF
GOLD IN SIGHT
The Discoverer of a Rich
City* Ledge Is No
Better Cff
In Vain He Seeks for Some
Way to Mine a Public
Street
Guarding the Secret of the Location
and Restlessly Eager to
Ezp ore It.
The man who, as recently published in
The Call, bas fonnd a rich gold-bearing
vein of quartz in one of the streets of this
City is meeting with the utmost difficulty
in trying to profit by his discovery, and
still euards bis secret.
He knows the ledge is there, and he has
it covered up. The assay from samples is
rich. But when by chance he came across
the ledge there was not enough of it ex
posed to make him sure just which par
ticular lots on both sides of the street it
might cross.
He would run a big risk in prospecting
in the street to determine the direction
and extent of the vein without permission
from tne Supervisors to dig up the street,
for passers-by and the ever-watchful po-
lice would have their curiosity aroused and
would investigate. He would also be lia
ble for misdemeanor. Lawyers have told
him that even the Supervisors cannot grant
a permit to mine a public street. An open
refusal for such a permit would reveal the
very secret upon which the discoverer
bases his hopes. He is determined to let
no one mow where that mine is until he
can have a share in its wealth.
Early yesterday morning he was at the
City Hall cautiously trying to solve the
problem. Everywhere he applied the offi
cials politely asked the name of the street,
and he turned sadly away. He wanted to
learn if the street really belongs to the
City or is only a thoroughfare dedicated
nt some time to the City to be used as a
street.
He wanted to know this because he had
been told that if not deeded to the City
the right .n the land under the street re
mains with the original title, and tbe
owner of the abutting lot would, in sucu
a case, have the right to work under to
the midd:e of the street, as long as he did
not harm the usefulness of the thorough
fare itself.
Friendly disposed clerks offered to look
up the records if he would say what street,
but he would not, and they would not
permit his private accebs to the books.
He consulted two lawyers, but received
little encouragement. They told him that
his knowledge of the location does not in
itself have a mark-table value. He can
give no title.
He is worried but hopeful. When he
returned late yesterday afternoon to his
home in Jersey street, after a day's fruit
less search and vain inquiry, he was as
determined as ever in guarding the sreret
that has occupied his thoughts for several
weeks.
"If. after all," he said, "I can't do any
thing with it, I'll wait a while, and then
give the whole thine away. It will cause
some excitement in tne neighborhood,
and there will be a little satisfaction for
me in seeing that"
And then the discoverer remarked, as
one whose thoughts were still hopelessly
on other matters, "You see, there are a
good many visitors here to-day. They are
relatives. My wife bas given birth to a
little daughter."
Saunderson Is Agent.
At a meeting of the Carpenters' and Joiners'
Union H. Saunderson was elected for the
fourth time as the business agent of tlie
union. His previous management of the
union's interests had met with the universal
approval of the members, hence his re-election
to this responsible office.

Disappointment Ortr the .Poor Shouting
â  JttÂ»de by " Hob ArmttronQ. â 'â 
NEW YORK, N. V.. Dec. 21.â Arm
strong of â - Chicago, the colored heavy
weight, who was heralded as a "second
Peter Jackson," proved to be a vast disap
pointment to his friends by his showing
with Charley Strong, the New York col
ored heavy-weight, at the Broadway Ath
letic Club to-night.
With an advantage of seven inches in
height and twenty-five pounds in weignt
it took the Chicago man nineteen rounds
to dispose of Strong, who is only' a
game" second-rater. Armstrong had lost
skill and vital power. He depended on a
straight jab and never used his right until
the deciding blow, and had absolutely no
knowledge of countering.
Had Strong been tall â  enough to reach
the Chicagoan's jaw the result might have
been different. As it was the New York
man fought a game fight against bis odds
and was loudly queered at the finish.
Joe Choynski, George Dixon and John
Thomas were behind Armstrong. George
Connolly, Dave Leahy and "Scotty"
Faulkner seconded Strong.
They were scheduled to go twenty
rounds at catchweigbts.
Dick Roche was referee and Jim Laville
kept the gong. Armstrong was a slight
favorite in the light betting.
FIGHT AT PASO ROBLES
Alberto Subio of 'Los Angel? a Knocked
Out by "Billy" Xttci*. *
PASO ROBLES, Gal., Dec. 21.â "Billy"
Lewis of this : place knocked ; out Alberto
Rubio in the seventh round of their con
test Saturday night. The mill was
brought off in the Paso Robles Opera
house before a large audience. It was a
fast fight from start to finish. Honors
were easy until toward the end of -the
sixth round, when a right swing on the
neck staggered Rubio and the call of time
alone saved him from a knock out. Lewis
ended the contest in the seventh with a
left hoot on the jaw. -
The tight was refereed by Herman Ep
pinger Jr. of Paso Robles. When he en
tered the ring he was searched for con
cealed weapons and an officer succeeded
in locating a sixshooter and a bowie-knife
in his pockets. Eoplnger explained that
he was following the precedent established
by Wyatt Earp in San Francisco, and this
was considered satisfactory.
The effort is being made to match Lewis
and "Spider" Kelly of San Francisco. It
is believed the mill will be arranged.

PERISHED BY FIRE
AT GRUB GULCH
Engineer Haskell's Wife
Loses Her Life in Spite
of His Efforts.
He Arrives With the Remains
and Tells a Sad
Story.
Mr. Hasksl], a Graduate cf Annapolis,
and His Wife Connected With
Old Families.
Charles W. Haskell, manager of a gold
property at Grub Gulch, Madera County,
arrived here yesterday, accompanied by
the body of his wife, Mrs. Gertrude
Haskell, who lost her life by tire last
Thursday nigbt.
The circumstances surrounding the
tragedy make it peculiarly tad. Mr.
Haskell is a distinguished engineer, and
his wife was a daughter of Dr. Livingstone
of New York and connected with the Kis
sams and Vanderbilts. She also had
prominent relatives in Philadelphia and
Hartford, Conn. Mr. Haskell is a gradu
ate of tne United States Naval Academy
at Annapolis. He was formerly superin
tendent of the Yankee Girl mine at
Ouray. Colo. It was in Denver that he
met his wife five years ago, and there they
were married.
They went to Portland immediately
after, and there and ac. Cascade Locks Mr.
Haskell was employed on a large amount
of Government work. Eighteen mouths
ago they went to Grub Gulch, wheie Mr.
Haskell began his mining operations.
He says that on the evening of the acci
dent he and bis wife had been out horse
back riding and bad returned at about
9:30 o'clock. While he was busy in one
of the buildings changing his clothes and
writing she went iiiio tne kitchen to pre
pare a lunch. She put down the candle
and her clothes caught fire. Her screams
were heard by her husband, and he ran
and got a laree comforter with which he
tried to suppress the flames. He did not
succeed, and he rushed out for a bucket of
water. The bucket happened to be filled
and he dashed it over her. He then put
out the fire.
"I was all alone," said he, "and scarcely
knew what to do, but I happened to
think of some oil at one of the buildings.
I got this and put it over her, and finally
I put each of ht>r hands into a bucket of
oil. This eased her pain. I also got some
morp&ine near at hand and gave some to
her.
"A ChinesÂ« employe soon came up,
and ne notified the miners who were
working for me and who were some 400
yards away. One went fifteen miles for
Dr. McGovern, who arrived at 4 o'clock.
A couple of nurses bad meanwhile been
secured. But my wife only lived thirty
hours."
The remains will be forwarded to New
York for burial in Trinity Churchyard.
Mr. Haskell' s hands were badly burned,
and are now swathed in bandages. He is
afraid he will lose two fingers.

Good weather for shopping.
Don't forget something for the poor.
After all, the sweet of the season is
charity.
This is no holiday season for San Pedro
and Santa Monica.
Make yourselves happy this week, for
next week comes the swear off. â¢
The holiday adjournment has come and
Congress has not disturbed the peace yet.
Cuba will not receive recognition in
time for Christmas, but she will get it in
the end.
In the next tariff law the principle of
reciprocity will be as luminous as if printed
in red letters.
One of the best ways to do the proper
thing for the poor is to aid the work of the
Salvation Army.
Spain might as well recognize that Cuba
is at any rate tuo independent to take any
licking she can give.
If we patronize our small industries
they will soon become great ones, aud all
of us will profit by them.
While we are reforming things let us
reform the home market. Why should
we buy so many foreign goods?
Grover has Christmas ducks for every
body except the Cubans, and it looks as if
he intends to give them the goose.
The Cuban war talk in the Senate is suf
ficiently lurid to prom ptp t the Congressional
Record to get out a colored supplement.
Oar stores are bright with novelties and
dainties from all parts of the world, bui
none are better than those we produce at
home.
The Christmas Call will add to the
pleasure of the day in every household.
Leave orders for it for yourself and for
your friends.
Protection sentiment in England is
growing rapidly, and before many years
are over free trade may be literally wiped
off the face of the earth.
The movement for a reformed civil ser
vice in California brings the issue home
to us at a time when our homes are pre
pared to receive it hospitably.
The people, the sea captains and the in
surance men all prefer San Pedro harbor
to that of Santa Monica. Now what will
the Government commission do?
The success of the fair at Fresno is not
to be measured by the money taken in at
the pavilion but by the wealth it brings to
the industries and trade of the great San
Joaquin.
The increase in the Republican vote of
the Southern States in 1896 over that of
1892 was more than 500.000. The people
down thera have evidently profited by the
depression to learn wisdom.
The reported discovery of a gold ledge
ia one of the streets of the Ciiy need sur
prise nobody. There has been money
enough sunk in every one of them to show
gold croppingsall over town.
Oakland should not complain if some of
her people come to San Francisco to do
their trading, since so many of our people
go there to make their homes and pay
taxes. There is always virtue in reci
procity.
The suggestion of Judge McKenna for a
position in the Cabinet adds another to
ihe list of good men proposed for the
j.lace from California, and it will go hard
for us if McKinlsy cannot find one among
them to suit him.
It is reported the Democrats of Con
gress will not attempt to hold a caucus
this winter unless "an exigency arises."
There is a hint in this for some mischief
maker to get in and raise an exigency just
to see the circu?.
At a recent meeting of the protection
ists in England one of the speakers said
"the only ruler under heaven who has
adopted the principles of the Cobden
Club is the Sultan of Turkey." The
truth of the statement is beyond the
reach of denial and the argument is
weighty.
The war Detween the Havemeyer com-
Liuation and the A^buckies will be a good
thing for the public breakfast table for a
little while, but sooner or later the people
will have to pay the cost of it. Sugar and
coffee cannot fight one another very long
without making a raise from the pockets
of those who consume them.
M. Meline, Prime Minister of France,
recently told the Chamber of Deputies
that the only relief for the agricultural de
pression is a return to bimetallism, and it
wouid seem from this that we will have a
strong ally in France when the McKinley
administration starts out to bring about
an international agreement on the subject.
Senator Sherman has very aptly refuted
the opinion that the recognition of the
independence of Cuba by this country
would lead to hostilities with Spain by
saying "Spain recognized the independ
ence of the Confederacy in 1861 before a
single battle had been fought, if we ex
cept the firing on Fort Sumter, and yet
that was not considered cause for war."
CUBAN INDEPENDENCE.
The report of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations in support of the reso
lutions recognizing the independence of
Cuba and offering the friendly offices of
the United States to bring about a s-ttle
rnent of the war between Spain and the
island is an elaborate review of all the
precedents affecting the issue and a satis
factory showing that such action on our
paVt would be neither a violation of inter
national law nor a new departure in our
dealings with Spain and her possessions
in America.
The report lays down, to begin with,
the rule established by Canning when, as
Prime Minister of Great Britain, he recog
nized the independence of Greece, then in
a state of revolt against Turkey. Accord
ing to that rule the character of belliger
ency is not so much a principle as a fact.
A certain degree of force and consistency
acquired by any mass of population en
gaged in war entitles that population to
be treated as belligerents.
In the opinion of the committee the Cu
bans have acquired the degree of force and
consistency which, under Canning's rule,
entitles them to recognition. The report
says:
On the military side, as we officially know,
they have organized, equipped and main
tained in the field sufficient forces to baffle
the exertions of 200,000 Spanish soldiers. On
the civil side they have organized their sys
tem of administration in every province, for,
as we know officially, they roam at wilr over
at least two-thirds of the inland country.
The argument of the report from Ameri
can precedent is even stronger than that
drawn from British sources. When a
similar question arose at the time of the
revolt of the Spanish colonies in South
America President Monroe acted promptly
in recognizing the independence of Mex
ico, Colombia, Chile and Buenos Ayres as
soon as they demonstrated their ability to
organize governments and their power to
maintain them.
The report is moderate in its tones. It
suggests no threat against Spain and af
forda that country no cause for war with
us on account of any action we may take
in granting-' belligerent rights to the Cu
bans or in recognizing the independence
of their country. It will go far to
strengthen a sentiment in favor of the Cu
bans among the conservative classes of
the country and will undoubtedly win for
the resolutions proposed by the commit
tee a strong support in both houses of
Congress.
ELECTRIC RAILWAYS.
The proposed construction of an electric
railway between Jackson and San An
dreas is one of the projected enterprises of
the State in which more than ordinary in
terest will be taken. It will be an experi
ment which all sections of California will
watch with interest, for if it prove suc
cessful many other districts of the State
will profit by it and construct similar
roads for their own advantage.
The proposed line is an offspring of the
projected construction of the Sierra Pacific
Railroad, which is to run out of Stockton
and tap the mining region? to the east
ward of that city. The electric line will
reach north and south from the Sierra
Pacific and will serve as a feeder to the
Stockton road. The electricity to operate
the engines is to be obtained from water
power used in the mme 1 ?, and will be
therefore of but comparatively .little cost.
It is said that the immense electric power
plant now being put up on the Mokelumne
River by an English syndicate will have
sufficient power not only for the mines
in that locality, but also for the proposed
road, so that this portion of the enter
prise seems already provided for.
There are many other portions of the
State where extensive water Dower runs
idly with the streams from the foothills
to the plains. At many of these points it
would be possible to erect plants for elec
tric roads if the experiment in Aniador,
Calaveras and Tuolumne proves success
ful. The roads would of course open up
the districts through which they pass and
lead to their settlement and cultivation.
In a comparatively short time they would
transform the condition of many a section
of the State now comparatively unoccu
pied by reason of its remoteness from
trade centers and the lack of transporta
tion. Much, therefore, may be expected
from the work which has now been pro
j cted. If it proves to be a profitable
enterprise all California will be benefited
by the stimulus it will give to similar
enterprises elsewhere.
BRITISH PROTECTIONISTS.
In their recent conference at London
the protectionists of Great Britain gave
the free-traders of that country some very
grave questions to consider. The orators
of the' conference wasted no time in dis
cussing the old compromise plan of "fair
trade," nor did they show much regard
for the long-vaunted scheme of free trade
between Great Britain and her colonies, to
the exclusion of the rest of the world.
The principal speakers declared for pro
tection outright, and asked it not upon
the plea of fair trade nor of imperial fed
eration, but upon its necessity to the wel
fare of the British people.
On the question of preferential trade
with the colonies and protection else
where, the Right Hon. James Lowther,
who presided at the conference, was ex
plicit. He was as strongly opposed to the
ruin of the British farmer by Manitoba as
by Minnesota. The free import of wheat
from one country was as injurious as from
another. He went on to say that between
2,500,000 and 3,000,000 acres of land had
been elbowed out of cereal production in
England for Â£130,000,000 worth of imports,
the most of which could be produced
there. He was in favor of a duty of 5 per
cent on wheat, which, he said, would yield
a revenue of Â£12,500,000, yet only raising
the price of bread for a full-grown man -Si
914 d a year.
The leading speech of the conference
was made by Sir Henry Hoyle Howarth,
one of the most eminent writers on
financial and economic subjects in Par
liament. He declared that preaching to
the free-traders of Great Britain was
preaching to deaf ears, and hela tlvnt the
only effective means of achieving the ob
jects of the conference was to make mat
ters extremely uncomfortable for the free
traders. He went on to point out that
the conditions of industry in England
were rapidly approaching that state of dis
comfort which would compel even the ex
tremest free-traders to revise their opin
ions on the subjÂ°ct.
Among other things he called attention
to the conditions created by foreign com
petition, dwelling upon the inroads made
upon British trade by German manu
facturers, and said that under the exist
ing free-trade policy there was nothing for
the English workingman to do but to dig
his own grave, using a foreign-made spade
for the purpose, and then to be buried in
a coffin "made in Germany" or some
other foreign country.
The sentiments expressed by the leading
speakers were cordially approved by those
who followed them. Abundant statistics
were cited to prove that protection is
needed, not only for the British farmer
but for the British manufacturer. Among
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1896.
these were figures cited by Lord Marsham
showing that the British export trade in
manufactures had not increased during
the last thirty years, while the foreign
trade of Germany in that time had in
creased upward of $175,000,000.
The whole tone of the conference re
vealed that the protectionists are sanguine
of the growth of public sentiment in favor
of tiie measure they advocate. It is more
than likely they will feel themselves strong
enough in many sections of the kingdom
to make the question of protection to
British industries the dominant issne in
the next Parliamentary elections, and it
would not be surprising if within a com
paratively few years the free-traders of
that country were as discomfited as they
are in all other progressive nations.
It was stated by one of the speakers at
the conference that the only ruler who to*
day supports the principles of the Cobden
Club is the Sultan of Turkey. It is prob
able, moreover, that the Sultan would not
practice them if he could do anything else.
At any rate it is not likely the British
farmer will care to pursue a policy which
threatens to reduce the agriculture of his
country to a coudition like that of the
Ottoman empire.
"THE CHRISTMAS CALL."
The Christmas edition of The Call will
be the most elaborate of the holiday pa
pers. It will reach its readers at the ap

To sum up briefly The Christmas
Call will be a paper that will delight you.
It will be the paper your Eastern friends
will be sure to enjoy, and extra copies
should be ordered as soon as possible.
THE BARRETT BILL.
Representative Barrett of Massachu
setts, who distinguished himself on enter
ing Congress last winter by introducing a
resolution for the impeachment of Em
bassador Bayard, has sought to attain
an equal distinction at this session by in
troducing a bill which requires the Presi
dent to select members of his Cabinet
from either the House of Representatives
or the Senate, with the exceptions that
the Secretary of the Treasury shall be a
member of the House and the Secretary
of State a member of the Senate.
The bill has just barely enough virtue
to give rise to discussion and enable Mr.
Barrett to make a speech. The issue in
volved in the question is not a new one
in theoretical politics. It ia the old con
troversy whether the British form of gov
ernment with a Cabinet chosen from Par
liament is better than the American sys
tem of a Cabinet altogether separate and
distinct from Congress. Eacii of these
systems has its advantages and its de
fects, and while that of Great Britain
is no doubt best for the British, since they
prefer it and continue it, there is just as
little doubt that our system is best for us.
The adoption of the Barrett bill would
not gain for us the lull benefit of the Eng
lish system. The most important feature
of the British form of ministerial govern
ment is that me ministers not only have
seats in Parliament but are directly re
sponsible to it. They can be removed
from office at any time by a simple vote of
want of confidence. The Barrett resolu
tion would not provide Congress with that
power. The members of the President's
Cabinet would hold their seats in the ex
ecutive department whether they had a
majority of Congress with them or not.
The only possible benefit, therefore, from
the change would be that of having Cabi
net officials in both houses of Congress
to advocate and defend all administration
measures that arose.
As an inevitable consequence of Cabinet
officers with seats in Congress every meas
ure, whether introduced by the adminis
tration or not, would have to pass the
criticism of the Cabinet officials. It
would, therefore, be known at once
whether such measures were likely to be
vetoed and the whole courae of Congres
sional debate would be directed for or
against the administration. If such a
debate could end as it does in England by
an overthrow of the Cabinet, when the
Cabinet was opposed to Congress, there
would be some practical gain from it, but
as it would not be so with us it is hard to
see that any really good results would
come from the new plan.
Our Government was designed with care
to keep the legislative and executive de
partments separate. This system, if it
has not always worked satisfactorily, has
been on the whole well suited to the
genius of the American people. There
are not many who would like to see our
well-established constitutional forms
changed for slight reasons. Mr. Barrett's
bili, therefore, will hardly do anything
more than occasion a debate and give him
an opportunity of showing to his con*
stituents once more that although he is a
new man in Congress he is always
prominent.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"All the crackerjack bicyclists of the country
are coming here to winter," said G. A. Bovee,
the champion of Texas, to a Call representa
tive at the Grand yesterday.
"Among them are Clint Coulter, the Cali
fornian; Arthur Gardner, who was the star of
one of the Eastern teams; Tom Cooper, who
heads the list of all riders, and many other
notables. Gardner holds the half and quarter
records unpaced.
"They are coming here because there is no
where else that they can practice and keep in
shape. Bicycling now is like piano-playing,
prize-fighting and training horsesâ one has to
practice daily or he quickly falls behind. This
thing of riding for six months in the year and
then laying off for six more because of cold
weather can't be done any more.
"We have got to practice all the time or else I

we are not In it. Things have changed from
what they used to be. Formerly a wheelman
could lay off for months in the winter and
go ahead in the spring, but he can't any more.
He must keep practicing all the time.
"It is for this reason that the bicyclists are
all coming to Californiaâ a land where there
is no snow and ice, where it is salubrious and
where tracks are good perpetually. There is
nowhere else for them to go and keep in ship
shape.
"I never do anything but track work and for
that reason, of course, I did not wheel my way
up here from Texas. I simply put my bicycle
about the cars at El Paso and then climbed on
myself and rode straight tnrough. Those Col
orado and Mojave deserti would have been
terrible to come over with a wheel. 1 wouldn't
think of it, nor of any ordinary road bicy
cling.
"This kind of work unfits me entirely for the
track. Makes one shiver. It effects the mus
cles differently. Even here I will never ride
on my wheel to the tracJt. I will keep the
wheel at the track, and will ride back
and forth on the cars. If a fast bicyclist were
to ride and get in a state of perspiration, as he
would, ana then ride back It would not only
spoil his speed, but would injure him other
wise. He could not rub down as he should
and It would hurt him."

REVISING THE CALENDAR.
Scientific American.
It is suggested that on Jannary 1, 1900, a
new division of the year into thirteen months
be instituted. If such a division was made
the fint twelve months would have twenty
eight days or four weeks each, and the new
month twenty-nine days, to make 365, and
thirty in leap years. After a few days there
would be no need to refer to calendars, as the
same day of the week would have the same
date through the year. If January 1 was, say,
Monday, every MondÃy would be the Ist, Bth,
15th and 22d; every Tuesday the 2d,9th, 16tn
and 23d, and so on tnrough the year. The
changes of the moon would be on about the
same dates through the year, and many calcu
lations, like interest, dates oi' maturing notes,
Easter and many other important dates, would
be simpliiied. Although the present genera
tion would have to figure new dates for birth
days, and all legal holidays except New Year
would be on different dates-, yet the gain
would be more than tne loss, as that would be
permanent and the objections trifling.

SECRETARY OF MINES.
Denver Times.
Elsewhere in to-day's issue will be found the
views of a number of prominent Denver citi
zens on the subject of a secretaryship of mines
in the National Cabinet. Since this proposi
tion was first presented by the San Francisco
Call during November tho subject has re
ceived serious consideration from all portions
of the country, opposition having developed
only among those who from principle or habit
stand unfavorable to further extension of Gov
ernment service.
Tne gentlemen interviewed in the Times
present most of the urgent reasons for the cre
ation of this new department. It would serve
many ends that have not yet been conceived,
and not i he least of its utilities would be the
education of tne public upon mineral matters,
just as they have been educated in agricul
tural matters since the creation of the Depart
ment of AgrlcuKure. The scientific and prac
tical aspects of mining would be vastly stimu
lated by Federal direction, and economies
would be effected in the production of both
useful and precious metals that would be as
universal in their application as the econo
mies that have been effected under Secretaries
Rusk and Morton.
A Secretary of Mines is by all means one of
the needs of the day, and allowance should be
made in the Federal Government for his ap
pointment. President Cleveland seems to
know nothing about mines. Let us not leave
President McKinley in the same ignorance.

A COLLISION IN
SACRAMENTO RIVER
Two of the Southern Pa
cific's Boats Came
Together.
They Ran Into Each Other Dur
ing Last Sunday Night's -
Fog.
The Knight Nc. 2 Was Beached in
Order to Save Her From
Sinking.
TheSonthern Pacific Company's steam
ers Modoc and Knight No. 2 were in col
lision yesterday morning. The Knight
was picking up freight from way points
and the Modoc was on her way to Sacra
mento. The latter had the best of the en
gagement, as the Knight had to be run on
the mud flats in order to save the cargo
and crew. There were over 500 tons of
potatoes aboard, but as the Knight sank
in fresh and shallow water the damage to
them was not great.
The teletrraphic news from the scene of
the accident was as follows:
During a heavy fcg this morning the steamer
Modoc ran into the steamer Knight Xo. 2, cut
ting her to the water's edge. The Knight was
run on the sandbar to prevent siuklng.
Xo lives were lost.
The log was very thick and both vessels
came together in the narrow channel be
fore a warning whistle could be sounded.
The Knight will be taken to Sacramento
for repairs.
There is another bay mystery and the
police are at work on the case. Early last
week one of the watermen at Meiegs
wharf misled nis boat, and later Henry
Peterson reported it as being adrift in
Oakland Creek. Afterward, however, the
Amy came along and Captain Wilson
iound a live sailor aboard.
The story is a simple one. Last Thurs
day one cf the boys who earn their living
by boating from the Powell-street wharf
lost nis boat. For weeks he bad been
figuring on a Christmas dinner and his
engagements for the next day were
enough to provide money to buy a goose
and all the accessories. Friday morning
the boat was fone and Saturday morn
ing's papers passed her as they sped up
Oakland Creek in the tugs Millie, Amy
and Annie.
The man who stole the Whitehall was
oblivions to all warnings. The Amy
nearly ran the boat down, but he paid no
attention. The Annie ran alongside, but
no answer being given, Captain Titch
worth hurried along. The Millie, Amy a:id
Annie had the morning papers aboard, so
they wasted no time, but all three made a
bee line for the derelict as soon as the
mail was on the dock. All three vessel*
reached the drifting boat about the same
time, and then there was a surprise. Tne
man. who was asleep under a small sail,
came out and cursed them all and sundry.
Toe captains of me steamers cursed back
and the air of Saturday morning was blue
for a few moments.
That was the end of the matter until to
day, when the master of the creek steamer
Emma reported that ''between the north
jetty and the lighthouse a partly tilled
boat, with three boards out and a canvas
covering," was passed. The boards were
p>aced on each side in order to hold the
sail that made a houseboat out of a White
hall. The boat was not picked np and the
question is, Was she the one stolen from
Meiggs wharf, and who was the man who
stole her?
The ferry tower is a conspicuous point
at the present time. The distance from
floor to floor has been a point of contro
versy for months, and many a bet awaits
its final decision from to-day's publica
tion. Looking at the towtr from a dis
tance men have wagered cigars and drinks
that ttie distance from floor to floor is ail
the way from fifteen to thirty feet. The
fifteen feet men win.
From the foundation the first floor will
be sixteen feet, the next twelve feet and
the third fifteen feet. From this point
the tower actually begins, and the hrst
floor will be thirteen teet from the base.
Then there will be rive stories of fifteen
feet each and t<vo stories of sixteen feet
each Then comes the cupola, which will
be five stories of eleven feet, twenty feet,
eighteen feet, twelve feet and six teet
each. â  Now the Oakland and Alameda
men can settle their bets among them
selves.
Captain Lonprnuir of the British ship
Glenhnart, who has been on the sick list
for a long time at St. Luke's Hospital, is
able to be around again. He is now al
most as well as ever. Captain Korff of
the Grenada has gone to Alameda to re
cuperate. H-5 has been a very sick man
for some time, and now his friends say he
is well on the way to recovery.
Luke G. Sresovicb, the well-known
trader in South Sea island products, is
having more fun than usual in the dis
charging of the cargoes of his vessels. The
Tropic Bird has an unusually heavy
cargo of cocoanuts, which will later on be
turned into articles of commerce at an ad
vanced price. Every "wharf rat" on the
front has congregated at Mission-street
wharf and cocoanuts are at a premium.
The old-time ship-building firm of Har
land Wolff has evidently recovered from
the disaster that almost wiped out the
works a few months ago. Tne Arabia, a
5450-ton ship built for the Hamburg-
American line, has just been launched.
and as she was one of the vessels on the
ways when the fire occurred it may be
presumed that some good work was done
by the Fire Department. The Arcadia, a
sister ship to the Arabia, had been
launched and tried a week before the
Arabia. She proved a success, so no one
was surprised when the Arabia beat record
time.

HIS BITTER WORDS
FROM THE GRAVE
How the Late Judge Tilden
Showed His En
mity.
Effort of the Jurist to Disinherit
the Son of His Sec
ond Wile.
In His Will He Declares He Never
Saw the Child and Doesn't
Know Its Name.
The musty records of tte probate courts
frequently bring to light domestic and
neighborhood quarrels that for years have
been hidden from ttie public view or have
been lost from the memories of all except
those mo.-.t intimately connected with the
controversies.
An illustration of this truth is presented
in the filing of a petition by Laura M. Til
den for the admission to probate of the
wiil of her father, the late Judge M. C.
Tilden, who died several mouths ago.
The property for tho recovery of which
these proceeding are ostensibly inaugu
rated amounts in value to but $125, now
in the hands of \V. B. Maydweil, but it
seems that the ultimate intention is to
place on record the intentions anci wishes
of the decedent in regard to the disposal
of a considerable quantity of real estate
situated in Sacramento County, concern
ing which there is a probability of a con
test.
Judge Tilden was for years a prominent
lawyer in Nevada and Caliiornia, having
participated in a great deal of the impor
tant litigation that marked the early his
tory of the Pacific Coast, and bis wilL
gives an outline oi some of the domestic
events of his life.
The opening paragraph of the instru
ment declares that he was married to
Elizabeth J. Ralston in Sacramento County
on the 3d day of February, 1861, and that
three children, the result of this union,
are living. To these he bequeaths his en
tire estate, with this explanation: "By
my said wife I came into possession of
neariy all the property I ever had, and it
rightfully belongs, when I am done with
it, to my said children as the iegal heirs
of their said mother. * * * I will
state, however, that I have given and in
tend to give to my said children all the
property chat I have before I die, and I
am in hopes that when I die I will not
own any estate whatever, but that it will
be ves'.ed by a good title in my said chil
dren and that it will never be necessary
to administer upon t. is wiil. And I only
make this will out of abundant caution.
It is my will, wish and desire, however, if
this wili is ever admitted to probate, that
my eldest daughter, Laura M. Tilden, be
appointed executrix without bonds."
There is another phase of Judge Til
den's life brought to view in the conclud
ing paragraph of the will, which reads as
follows:
Whereas, on the 17th of May, 1883, 1 was
again married in Sacramento, Cai., to Meta
M. Woodland, and was divorced from her by a
decree of divorce entered in the District Court
of the First Judicial District of the State of
Nevada, in Storey County, on the 30th of
August, 1884; and whereas, I have been in
formed by the neighbors and others that the
said Meta M. gave birth to a male child on or
about the 24th of February, 18S4. What the
given name of said child is Ido not know. I
have never seen said child, aud do not know
whether said Meta M. claims that I am the
father of iaid child or not, but it is my wili,
wish and desire that neither the said child
born of the said Meta M. nor the descendants
or heirs of the said child shall ever inherit
anything from me or of my estate or of the
estate of my three children first above
named, or ot any estate that 1 may inherit or
that my descendants may inherit through
me, it being my intention, will, wish aud de
sire that all such estate shall descend to my
three children by my said wife, Elizabeth J.
Ralston-Tilden, and to their lawfu. issue, and
none of it ever go to the said child of the said
Meta M., nor to his descendants or heirs.
Judge Tilden was known in his lifetime
as a constant friend and an implacable foe,
for which reason his acquaintances wiil
not be surprised at the enm particularity
with which he attempts to cut off without
a shilling the child of his second wife. He
quarreled withherscon after the marriage
and it is evident that he extended to her
son the unrelenting hatred which he felt
for her.
Judge Coffey has set the hearing of the
petition to admit the will to probate for
Monday, January 4, i 897.
FIGHT OVER CARDS
Four Young Men, One a Capitalist, Get
Into the Hands of the Police.
Herbert L. Younger, capitalist, living
at 1912 Green street; J. P. Cullen, a sales
man; John Breen and J. Bassity, both
with no occupation, were playing cards in
a saloon at Mason and Ellis streets early
yesterday morninp, when a dispute arose
and a free fii:ht followed.
Policemen Joy and Riiey heard the row
and placed them under arrest. Cullen
claimed that he bad been robbed of his
gold watch and diamond scarfpin, and it
looked Eerious for the others. When
searched at the City Prison, Cullen's
watch and pin were found in his overcoat
pocket, and the others heaved a sigh of
relief. Cullen, Breen and Bassity had a
charge of disturbing the peace booked
against them, and Younger, his eyes
blackened and his face bruised, was sent
to the Receiving Hospital. No charge was
booked at the prison against him, and
after his face was dressed he was sent
home.
Cullen, Breen and Bassity appeared in
Judg* Joachimsen's court yesterday morn
ing, and their cases were continued till
to-day.
SOUND TO FIND
OUT THEIR POWER
Railroad Commissioners
and Special Counsel
at Work.
Meeting Yesterday and Another
Likely to Take Piaca
To- Morrow.
Doors Kept Closed and Also Mouths
to Hold in Secrets, but Nsw
Moves Are Expected.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald had an
other consultation with the special coun
sel engaged by the Board of Railroad
Commissioners In regard to the next step
to be taken. Of the railroad board only
one was present, Commissioner La Rue.
All the lawyers representing the board
were there, the Attorney-General, Robert
Y. Hayne and W. WÂ« Foote.
As heretofore, the lawyers talked se
cretly and with closed doors. There was
a grim suggestion of smiles on their faces
j when at the close of the conference they
| were questioned concerning the subject of
| their deliberations, and whether anything
definite had been proposed or accom
plished. They said that nothing had
been aone. The Board of Railroad Com
missioners will, it is expected, meet to
morrow. Before they adjourn they may
hold a conference witf> the Attorney-
General and his le^al associates.
For the present the evident policy of the
Attorney-General is to prevent the least
inkling of his next move becoming public
until it has actually been taken. The
tiling of the demurrer in the United
States Circuit Court last Saturday is an ex
ample of this policy. Although one of
the questions at least involved in the de
murrer is fundamental â that one being
raised to determine whether the acts of
the Board of Railroad Commissioners are
under the terms of the constitution, by
which the commission was created, legis
lative â no bint that such a move was in
! tended reached the Southern Pacific Com
pany or the public in advance.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald said last
I evening that the filing of the demurrer on
I Saturday last did not indicate any change
I in or departure from t-e course which has
! been marked out. "The purpose of the
! demurrer was," he said, "to only tie up
i certain points. We shall go right ahead."
: When asked what he meant by this, he
said he had nothing further to say. The
true significance of the move has already
been explained in The Call.
The point concerning the reasonableness
of rates, based upon such figures of cost,
earnings and so on as may be supplied as
the result of Southern Pacific bookkeep
ing, will very likely lead up to the placing
in evidence of Southern Pacific books and
in calling to the witness-stand, where they
can be fully cross-examined, of Southern
Pacific officials.
The evident purpose of the Attorney-
General and of his two legal associates is
to determine fully, for the first time since
the adoption of the new constitution, the
full scope of the powers of the Board of
Railroad Commissioners. They expect to
make a full exposition of this very im-
I portant matter of public concern, and the
public will be able then to judge of the
precise amount of efficacy which the com
mission can have in the final- and definite
determination of rates and fares in this
State.
While the acts of the Southern Pacific
Company are under consideration and the
i combination of California railroads which
I it has succeeded iv making in restraint of
competition, by the system of leases to
which it has given rise, the Board of Rail
road Commissioners is trying to reach a
judicial determination of the fact that
it has power over all the strictly local
transportation lines, tho-e by water as
well as the railways. The lawyers have
already discussed the Market-street rail
way system, and will try to get a decision
concerning the regulative power which the
Commissioners may posseess in that re
gard.
No step has been taken publicly in this
direction since announcement of the fact
was made in The Call, but the subject
nas been discu-sed. If the conference
should not take place to-morrow concern
ing the vaiious issues involved in the
present contest with the Southern Pacific
Company, the Commissioners will prob
ably then appoint a day to meet their
lawyers when all can be present. In the
meantime the lawyers are studying the
situation and have other surprises when
the time shall arrive to make them public.

BOXED FOR GLORY
AND GOLD MEDALS
Evening of Nose-Punching
and Rib-Roasting at
the Olympic.
Five Fistic Bouts That Inter
ested Filteen Hundred Promi
nent Gentlemen.
The Successful Competitors Were
Lawlor, Brown, Hayes and Reay,
All of This City.
The announcement that the Olympic
Club had arranged a series of boxing con
tests for the pleasure of its members was
sufficient to draw a full house.
The boxing, although not up to the
usual scientific standard, wit very inter
esting, and frequently during the game the
spectators were thrown into spells of
laughter. During the entertainment Bob
Fitzsimmons and his manager, Julian,
entered the gymnasium.
Just prior to the opening bout the ama
teur master of ceremonies, Billy Kennedy,
announced that the contest between Stew
art Carter of the Olympic Club and G.
Koster of the Manhattan Club was de
clared off as the last-named boxer weighed
in ekht pounds over the weiaht stated in
the articles of agreement. McGinley and
Carter, however boxed four clever rounds.
The decision that was rendered in tne
bouu between Hayes of the Olympic and
Egan of the Manhattan Club was not sat
isfactory to a large number of members,
who thougtit that as Egan scored a strong
lead in the lirst three rounds a draw
would have been about proper. The
judges could not decide and George Green,
wtio was acting referee, gave the bout to
Hayes. The judges were Phil Wand and
Alexander Ros borough.
The first event of the evening was called
sharp at 8:30 o'clock. It was a four-round
bout between F. Schuler of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club and James Lawlor of
the Acme Club. The boxers weighed in
at 120 pounds.
Lawlor did not waste any time in spar
ring for an opening, but rushed right in
at his quarry and met Schuler with a
straight left on the nose. Six times he re
peated the dose and the ban P rancisco
Ci'ib man did not know what to do.
Lawlor kept up a regular battery on his
opponent's face and body, until Schuler
resembled an Apache Indian smeared in
war-paint. Five times Schuler was sent
to the boards, and was on his knees when
the gong came to liis rescue.
Everybody expected to see Schuler re
turn to the mill in a groggy state, but he
fooled the members by toeing the scratch
in tolerably good condition. Lawlor
pounced at Him like an infuriated demon,
but Schuler fought back as determinedly
as one of Con Mooney's game chickens.
In the third and fourth rounds Lawlor
outfought his opponent on all sides, and
received a well-merited decision. Schuler
received great ere i it for having made
such a gallant stand under heavy lire.
Tne second event was a four-round bout
between James Brown of the Olympic
Club and G. Mulligan of the Manhattan
Club.
They soaled 125 pounds. This was one
of thefunny contests of the evening. The
representative of the Manhattan Club
toed the scratch looking ferocious.
Tne contest was of the wild and woolly
order. The contestants relied solely on a
knocK-out blow to win the prize, and it
was a game of Hammer and tongs from
the first round to the last. The men could '
hardly stand on their pins when the gong
sounded the end of the engagement.
Brown got the decision.
The third event was an exhibition four
round bout between J. A. McGiniey and
Stewart Carter.
The fourth event was a contest between
M. P. Hayes of tho Olympic Club and M.
Eagan ol tne Manhattan Club. In tne
first and second rounds Hayes resorted to
ducking and hugging tactics, but in the
third round, under the advice of his sec
onds, he fared his opponent in a manly
fashion, and after a hot exchange he sent
Euzan to the boards with a straight left
on tne chin.
This brought forth great cheering from
the members, who wetÂ« seemingly in fa
vor of Hayes winning. Eagan was up in
a jiffy and more than doubly repaid Hayes
(or the blow he had received. The last
part of the round was lively, but Hayes
fell into his old game of ducking to avoid
punishment, and Eagan had to resort to
uppercutting.
In the last round Hayes got home some
good right and left punches, as his oppo
nent was pretty well exhausted from the
treatment he had received in the clinches
and breakaways, but Eagan returned blow
for blow and Hayes' face was smeared in
blood and bis left eye discolored at the
finish. The decision of Green was received
without a cheer, but a draw would have
"brought down the house."
The final event of the evening elicited
much amusement. The contestants were
J. W. Reay of the Olympic and P. Lynch
of the San Francisco Athletic Club.
The boxers slapped each other "real
hard" with open fists, and the contest re
solved itself into a game of endurance.
In the third round Lynch lost his bear
ings and he failed to find his opponent.
He was blear-eyed and sick, and rather
than allow Reay to slap him any longer
the referee ordered the men to their cor
ners and gave the bout to the Olympic
boy. This ended the sport.
Of foreign residents in China, the total
number last year was 10,091; of these,
4084 were British, 1325 Americans, 875
French, 812 Germans, and 805 Portuguese.
Of 603 foreign firms in China, S6l were
British.
COONEY REPEATS
"FAIR SIGNED THEM"
The Notary Sticks to His
Story Under George A.
Knight's Questions.
Charles Fair's Cross-Complaint
Against Mrs. Craven Has
an Inning.
Mr. Delmas Called Upon to Produce
the Deed, bat Smply Pays
No Attention.
At the instance of Knight & Heggerty
Notary J. J. Cooney went all over the
ground in the Craven ejectment suit yes
terday which he traveled sometime ago in
the suit of Angus vs. Craven to quiet title
before Judge Slack. Both suits are to test
tne ownership of the Mission and San
some street property, to which Mrs.
Craven claims to hold a deed from James
G. Fair. Yesterday the proceedings took
place before a notary in Knight <fe Heg
gerty's ollice and Mr. Knight did the
interrogating.
Nearly all the lawyers prominently con
nected with the Fair litigation were pres
ent, Mr. McEnerney being accompanied
by W. S. Goodfellow. Reuben Lloyd sat
quietly in a corner by himself, occasionally
going over and whispering a word to
Knight, who took these attentions quite
graciously considering the outburst of
impatience that a little bit of auvice irora
the same source provoked at their last
meeting in the august presence of Judge
Slack, when Delmas surprised the camp
by withdrawing Mrs. Craven's suits iv
ejectment, thereby depriving both of them
oi the right to examine the deeds. The
proceeding of yesterday was undertaken
by Knight & "Heggerty as counsel for
Charles Fair in the cross-complaint filed
by Mr. Fair in the ejectment suit of Mrs.
Craven.
Mr. Knight and all the rest of them who
stand lor the heirs as against Mrs. Craven
were saturated, evidently, with detail
corning from the $100 a day experts.
When Knight gave signs of failing in the
slightest minutice, the othersâ McEnerney,
Goodieilow, Lloyd and Haggertyâ were
ready with suggestions.
Knight asked the witness all about how
Fair came in with the deeos at the time
they were acknowledged; whether they
were folded or open ; what he said when
he handed them over; whetner be read
the name of Nettie R. Craven in them;
whether he noticed that the name of
"Mattie R. Craven" was in one of them
J instead of "Nettie R. Craven."
The witness bad no clear recollection of
the details. He did not know Mrs. Craven
then and iiad never met her since, he said ;
i would not know her if he met her. Fair,
|he said, had never acknowledged any
other deed before him.
Then the witness was questioned in
great detail as to the certificates of ac
j Knovledgment; where he bought such
certificates; if he had any sucn certiti
| c&tes at that time with his name printed
in ; it he did not turn over to his successor
in office a quantity of certificites with bis
name printed in them; where he got the
pen and ink with which he wrote the ac
knowledgment; did he use the same pen
and the same ink on both of them: did he
i clip the edges and (assenting that he did)
I where he got the scissors.
Mr. Knight, having got a mass of tech
nical and very interesting information
arx>ut the certificates, turned to Mr. Del
mas and asked him if he had the deeds
with him.
"I have not," said Mr. Delmas.
"You knew that the notice called for
their production here this morning?"
"I was told that there was such a notice
served, but'' â lightly trifling with his
glasses, "I paid no attention to it."
A slight smile appeared npon the faces
of all the lawyers, including Mr. Knight,
and the inquiry resumed its quiet way ad
to the exact location of the stationery
stores where Mr. Cooney bought his
blanks and the make and temper of the
scissors with whicn he clipped them after
buying. Entirely exhausting even the
suggestions of the other lawyers on these
points, Mr. Knight retuned again to the
deeds.
"Now, Mr. Delmas, wer ask that the;e
deeds be produced and submitted to this
witness for identification," he said.
"I hear what you say," said the witness
in his most even tone of voice.
"You decline?"
"I aim ply say that I hear what yon say.
You have no right to ask anything of us."
"But you are aware, Mr. Delmas," said
Mr. Heggerty, "that a notice was served
on your firm reg uiring you to produce the

GEARY STREET
NEXT IN LIKE
The Round- Headed Cobbles
of Pioneer Memory to
Be Removed.
Bitumen and Concrete to Be
Laid From Kearny to
Stockton.
Property-Owners Are Ashamed of the
Street's Condition and Business
Men Are Growling.
Geary street, from Kearny to Stockton, j
will in the near future put on a modern
surface of concrete and bitumen. The old ;
round-headed cobbles that have done ser- j
vice since the fall of '49 and the spring of j
'60 are to be torn up and dumped into the
bay to make foundation for the seawall.
The new and elegant building now in j
course of construction at the southeast j
corner of Geary and Stockton streets by
tne Spring Valley Water Company, with
the furniture-store alongside of It, on the j
site made holy by the old Starr King I
church, has brought that portion of Geary j
street into prominence as a business sec
tion, and this prominence demands the
removal of the crude pioneer pavement
put down at a time in the history of San
Francisco so remote that the musty vol
umes in the Pioneer Library would have
to be consulted as to the exact date when
the round stones were buried in the sands.
To have those objectionable rocks re
moved and a modern pavement substi
tuted originated in the mind of Sam Sachs,
one of San Francisco's native sons, who
has more than a passing pride in the future â¢
of his native City. Tbis young man con- !
suited ti.e other property-owners and from j
them obtained an expression of opinion as j
to the advisability of bringing Geary street i
into toucn with the other live business
streets of the City.
The response which he met justified his
fullest expectations, and now the fiat has j
been issued that tbis street must be made
one of t' c best in the Jower portion of the j
City and that it must be smoothly paved j
and lighted up with arc lamps, which will
at once bring it into prominence.
Since the removal of the objectiona
ble class of tenants that occupied Morton
street it is said that some large buildings
will be erected on tlve north side of Geary,
west of Grant avenue, in the near future.
The following are the names of the
property-owners on Geary street, be
tween Kearny and Stockton: Estate of \
T. Adams and M. Kibbe, the Blytbe es
tate, Jeanne de St. Marie, Louis Brack,
Davis .Brothers, L Levy, N. Luning estate,

HAYES STREET WILL JOIN.
The Merchants Have Almost Se
cured the Necessary Funds.
Hayes street is not going to remain in
the dark while the neighboring business
streets are being illuminated by arc lights.
The prime mover in the getting up of
subscriptions by which electric lights
wiil be swung over the center of this
street from Larkiu to Laguna is Chris C.
Rivers, the proprietor of a grocery-store,
who on consultation with the principal
business people found no difficulty in get
ting liberal aid for the object intended.
The storekeepers further west as far as
Webster street are talking about joining
the movement and have the lights ex
tended to that point.

place and the current turned on by New

LOTTERY TICKET CASES.
Chinese Gnmbicrg Will Probably Win
a Victory Over Collector Wise.
The Chinese iottery.ticket case was on
hearing yesterday before United States
District Judge Morrow. In Jnlv Collector
John H. Wise seized a large quantity of
lottery ticket blanks and District Attorney
Foote brought an action to have the paper
condemned and destroyed, claiming that
it is not lawful to import such stuff into
the United States. When the case was
heard before Comniissioner Heacock, it
was shown that the blanks were not lot
tery tickets, but that the Chinese charac
ters thereon were sacred songs.
The same line of evidence was presented
yesterday oeiore Judee Morrow. Gone
Tine, Harry Huff and D. D. Jones testi
fied that the papers were not lottery tick
ets and would not be until the name of
the lottery company is placed on the
papers. At present they are in reality
only lottery blanks containing only sacred
songs. The Government did not put on
any witnesses to show that the blanks
are lottery tickets, and Judge Morrow
took the case under advisement, intimat
ing, however, that he would be liable to
decree against Collector Wise.
POISON IN THE TIN.
G. P. Goff Died From the tffects of a
Small Cat From an Oyster-
Can.
George P. Goff, who had a law office at
430 Kearny street and resided at 207 Lar
kin street, died late Sunday under pecu
liar circumstances. It was blood poison
ing caused by a smal] cut from the sharp
edge of an oyster-can. On the 14th inst.
Goff opened a can of oysters and in doing
so he inflicted a slignt cut in his hand.
No attention was paia to the injury
untii the next day, when the hand began
to swell and be very painful. On the sec
ond day tue swelling had spread to the
entire arm and Dr. L. C. Cox was called.
He saw at once tnat it was a serious case
of blood poisoning. Mr. Goff sank rap
idly and finally died.
Deceased was a half-brother to Harry
N. Morse, the local detective. He wÂ»j a
native of New York and 70 years of age.
Years ago he was in charge of the Con
gregational boot binCery of that city.
Since then he has resided in San Fran
cisco, some six yeirs.
PHELAN IS NOT INSANE
Unsuccessful Attempt to Save a
Notorious Burglar From
Justice.
Be Had Been Feigning Insanity and the
Commissioners Decided He Was
All Right Mentaly.
An unsuccessful attempt was made yes
terday to save Robert Phelan. a notorious
burglar, from being punished for his
crimes on the ground that he is insane.
Phelan is a plumber by occupation, but
instead of earning an honest livelihood
at his trade he preferred a life of crime.
He was arrested on October 21 by Police
men Ryan and ODea on two charges of
burglary. One was for breaking into
Southern Pacific plumbing-shops and
stealing a lot of tools and the other for
looting the plumbing-shop of A. Roth, 958
Howard street.
Subsequently Ryan and ODea found
that he had also broken into the millinery
store of Miss Ida O'Connor, 36 Geary
street, and stolen about $900 worth of
stock. He also entered a piumbing-shop
in the same block, besides stealing the i
carpets from the vacant mouses* on Morto n
street and oiher places.
He went around dressed as a plumber,
and carried a set of tools with him. He
was suspected, along with another man
named Burke, of getting into vtcant j
houses on the pretense of being sent to
do some plumbing work, and stealing all
the lead pipe, faucets and other material.
A few weeks ago h#> was he:d to answer
before the Superior Court on two cnarpes
of burglary, the one for breaking into
Roth's shop, and the other for breaking
into Miss Connor's store. Last Friday he
was arraigned in the Superior Court on
the Roth charge. There are two prior
felony convictions against him, and a long
term in San Quentin is before him.
Since being in the County Jail awaiting
his trial he has been acting strangely.
At first he was surly in his manner, and
finally became so violent as to require
restraint It was the opinion at the jail
that be was feigning insanity to escape
punishment, and a close watch was kept
upon him.
Saturday morning his fattier, Patrick
Pnelan, 16 Clair street, swore out a war
rant charging him with insanity, so that
be could be taken he lore the Insanity
Commissioners. The police were notified
and preparations were made to have
overwhelming evidence brought to prove
that Phelan was perfectly sane.
Yesterday morning Phelan was brought
from the County Jail to the Receiving
Hospital by Deputy Sheriff Usner, and an
hour or two later was taken be'ore the
Commissioners. After hearing the cv -
dence the Commissioners remanded
Phelan into the custody of the Sheriff aud
be was taken back to the jail to await his
trial on the burglary charges.

TO PREVENT A DOG-FIGHT.
Humane Society Officers May Make a
Trip to Baden.
A dog-fight is planned to take place to
night at Baden in a factory. Some large
and ferocious dogs have been secured.
The owners of these dogs have expressed
the belief that no one will interfere with
them, but Secretary Hoi brook of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals talked over the matter with the
officers of the society yesterday.
What they will do is not made public,
but it was intimated last night that a raid
was intended if the sports were determined
to give the exhibition.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, IS9G.
MAYOR SUTRO
WAS WRATHFUL
Supervisors Call Him to
Order for His Ut
terances.
The Row Was Over the Location
of the Pfsthouse on the
Almshouse Tract
Surveyor Tiltcn Will Get His Money
for the New City Map in
Spite of Opposition.
Mayor Sutro and the Board of Supervi
sors had a wordy war yesterday after
noon which threatened for a time to ter
minate in a riot.
The chief executive hammered his gavel
until the walls sent the echo back, the
Supervisors howled themselves hoarse and
even the policeman who guards the outer
portal awqke from his reverie and pre
pared his handcuffs and club for action.
The row started when a motion was
made empowering the board to erect a
Pesthouse on the Almsbonse tract, to be
furnished and ready for occupancy before
the lepers were moved into it.
The Mayor had stood the acceptance of
the city map without a murmur beyond
a mild remonstrance, but this was too
much for him.
"This is a criminal and unwarranted
proceeding," he ahouted, rising in his
chair.
"There is no appropriation for this pur
pose," interjected Supervisor Taylor, "we
should leave it to our successors."
Supervisor Dimond took a hand at this
juncture and declared the present Pest
house to be a crying shame on the com
munity.
A motion to postpone was lost by a vote
of 9 to 2.
Then the Mayor again arose in his
might.
"Collis P. Huntington is a corrupt
man," he said, "and he has fostered and
incited tbis action. He is a corrupt man
and a criminal. "
"Order, order," yelled Supervisor Hobbs
and Supervisor Wagner added still further
to the confusion by admonishing the
Mayor not to speak from the chair, but to
give it up to some one else and talk from
the floor.
The Mayor would not be put off, how
ever, and went on to say that Hunting
ton's hirelings had started the idea of
selecting the Pesthouse site to spite him
self.
Supervisor Hobbs again called tue
Mayor to order, and while the din was at
its height the motion was carried by the
votes of Supervisors King, Scully, Ben
jamin, Hir.-ch, D mond, Hughes. Danker,
Morgan-tern and Wagner.
The Mayor made a tight against the
payment of the requisition for the new
City map on the ground that it had been
found faulty by the experts employed to
examine it. He declared that the map
would be the basis of the surveys of City
property for years to corue and that it
should not be accepted and paid for until
it was shown to be correct
He declared that he had not been noti
fied thar the matter was under considera
j tion and that the people had not been al
lowed proper representation.
Supervisor Dimond declared that the
Mayor's statements were unfounded and
that all concerned had been allowed a fair
bearing. He thought that it was more
unfair to the maker of the map to keep
him out of bis money after the work was
finished.
"The investigation has been thorough,"
he said, "and it is time the money was
paid."
A motion to postpone for three days
was lost by a vote oi 10 to 2, and tne requi
sition was passed over the Mayor's veto
by a unanimous vote.
Previous to the discussion, protests
against the acceptance of the map were
received from the following and referred
to the street committee: The Grand Jury.
Shainwald, BucKbee <fe Co., tfovee. Toy <fe
Sontag, A. J. Rich & Co., Tbomas Magee
& Sons, G. A. Umbsen, M. Cooney, Ed
wards Publishing Company, F. W. Mc-
Ewen, Samuel Bloom and C. D. Salfield.
Tne request of the Board of Health to
have the ordinance against expectoration
on the public sidewalks and in the public
streetcars and buildings created a discus
sion.
Supervisor Dimond remarked that the
Health Department would probably want
$30,000 additional to lurnish places for
cuspidor inspectors. He thought the
measure absurd.
After Supervisor Taylor had hazarded
something about the ladies wearing shorter
skirts if the order was not passed Super
visor Hughes said that perhaps the Board'
of Health would be able to furni-h compe
tent skirt inspectors. The order was
passed to print, Supervisor Dimond giving
notice of reconsideration.
The ordinance against pool-selling ont
side of the confines of racetracks was
finally passed, in spite of the opposition of
Supervisor Wagner. No one paid any par
ticular notice to the order when it was
read by the clerk, and the Mayor declared
it finally disposed of.
Later Mr. Wagner wanted it laid over
for one week, but Supervisor Benjamin
declared that it was too late, and a motion
by Supervisor Benjamin to indefinitely
postpone reconsideration was carried, by
the following vote: Benjamin, Dimond,
Hughes, Taylor, Morganstern, Spreckels
and Hobbs.
The noes were King, Scully, Hirsch,
Dunker and Wagner.

It was Dr. Abernetby, ' the celebrated
English physician, who once gave this ad-
vice to a wealthy patient. He was right.
It is a well-known fact that cold has a
way of finding out the weak spots in the
body and suddenly attacking them. It
generally strikes first at the stomach,
which is a very sensitive place. It next
affects the circulation and makes the
blood course feebly tnrough the vein?.
That is why people do catch cold have
aches and "pains, lose their appetite and
suffer fiom indigestion. : .
The way to prevent colds is to keep the
stomach warm and the blood moving rap-
idly by. the regular use of a ; pure stimu-
lant. Something should be taken to tone
up the system and fortify it against the
weakening effects of cold weather. For
this purpose nothing is better than Duffy's
pure malt whiskey, which is renowned for
its stimulating, . strengthening qualities.
Thousands of men and. women who use
this whiskey are enabled to escape the
dangers of colds, coughs, chills, grip and
â¢.neumonia. It frequently happens that
unscrupulous dealers attempt to substi-
tute some inferior imitation which they
claim is "just like" or "as good as"
Duffy's pure malt. There is, however,
nothing that can possibly take its place.

, Gay old Strathmeath and Jockey Char
ley Thorpe appear to be a combination
hard to beat. The Western chap yes
terday captured a race with Green Morris'
aged pelding that should have gone to
Kamsin. The event in particular was
second on the card and over a distance of
one mile and a sixteenth. Sam Hildreth's
All Over was the post favorite at odds of 9
to 5. with Karu.-in and Strathmeath both
closing at 11 to 5. "Skeets" Martin on
the outsider, Elmer F, made the running
until swinging into the stretch, where
; Kamsin and Ail Over closed on him. The
two made a wide turn, thus enabling
1 Thorpe to save several lengths with his
Jraount. He soon had Strathmeatn upon
1 nearly equal terms with Kamsin and
Laving several shades the best of it in the
way of. saddle work over Golden obtained
the verdict by a head in a hard drive.
The outsider, Elmer F, finished in the
show.

RETURNED THE TROPHY.
A Sportsmens' Organization That
Has Fitted Up New
Quarters.
Several of the M mbers Resigned
From tbe Olympic Because They
Were Dissaiisfied.
The secession moyement of certain dis-
Ratisfied members of the Olympic Gun
Club and the confusion arising from the
irregular method in which the withdrawal
was accomplished, is likely soon to be set
tied amicably and satisfactorily to all par
ties concerned.
ADout six weeks ago certain members
of the original Olympic Gun Club, which
is an annex of the Olympic Athletic Club,
formed a new club, but kept the old name
and claimed tbe trophies and by-laws of
the original club, suppoj ing that as a re
kuU of tbeir action the old club had be
come defunct. To this view of the sUua
tion tome of the members of the Olympic
Athletic Club demurred, because the gun
club had been fostered by the larger club
and tne trophies and by-laws were not the
property of the annex club, even though a
majority of them seceded. Moreover, they
â¢wished to continue ihe cun club under
the auspices of the Olympic AthLet;cClub.
To be eligible for admission to the gun
club it was necessary to be a member of
the Olympic Athletic Ciub, which is a
strictly amateur concern. These restric
tions caused some of the members to seek
an extension by forming a new club.
The leaders of the secession were M. L.
AlUn, H. H. White and H. C. Golcber,
who were the board of the original club.
Mr. Allen was the president of the Cali
fornia Inanimate Target Association, and
it is one of the questions brought up by
tbe secession: whether he still is president
of that association or whether his action
-c on becoming a member of a new Olympic
Â£ Gnn Ciub. which the association does not
â¢ recognize, disqualifies him to act as its
president. Supposing himself to be tne
president he recently called a meeting of
tbe board of governor* of the association.
The call was signed by George P. Schaefer
â  of this City at secretary-treasurer.
On December 17 H. J. Crocker, chair
man of tae Olympic Club, wrote to Secre
the programme, and for "blue" Monday
the attendance was above the average.
The flay was dehgntfuUy warm and pleas

says, he is perfectly willing they should
do, or else they will return to tie fold as

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1896.
PASTORS DIFFER
WITH HOWISON
Commissioner Harris Ad
dresses the Ministers'
Unions.
He Meets With Mere Indorse
ment Than the Berkeley
Professor.
A Large Number of Evangelical Minis-
ters Ask Qu st.ons of Harris
and H-wisin.
The seating and standing capacity of
the board room at 920 Sacramento street
was taxed to its utmost yesterday
morning to accommodate the members of
the different Evangelical ministerial
unions who nad responded to the invita
tion of the Presbyterian Ministerial
Union to hear addresses from Hon. W. T.
Hairis, United btates Commissioner of
Edutation, and Professor Howison of the
State University.
DR. W. T. HARRIS.
"Divine Philosophy" was the subject
which the pastors were to hear expounded.
Professor Harris spoke first, and he was
followed by P;ofessor Howison. Tbe first
speaker's remarks appeared to a great ex
tent to be a confirmation of theoogical
positions, but when Professor Howison's
turn to speak came he qualified his friend's
remarks on the grounds that "I am afraid
the doctor's speech, if not corrected, would
leave you entirely too satisfied with your
selves as pastors and Protestant?."
Hon. W. T. Harris dwelt on piety of the
intellect being necessary to raase relition
adaptable as a guide for action. "The
Christian religion," be said, "is not only a
relieion of love, but is essentially of tbe
intellect. With the coming of the Cdns
tian religion we come to absolute knowl
edge." Goethe's '"Faust" was used
through the greater part of the address to
illustrate the speaker's ideas. He showed
how Faust, starting with tlie pantheistic
idea 01 God, comes to the theistic idea at
the end. He was happier when he be- â¢
lieved in the piety of thy intellect; he was
unhappy in pantheism and he found no
real satisfaction in the pleasures ilephi
stopheles gave him. Faust's happiest mo
ments came in doing something for oth
ers. From Goethe's drama Commissioner
Harris drew the moral, "Altruism cannot
be tempted by Mephistopbeles."
After giving a sketch ot the struggle of
Christianity fur its existence against Mo
hammedanism iv the days oi Charles
Martel, the Commissioner described the j
Saracen scnoois of learning in Spain, and
said that the nan theism engendered among
Christian students attending them had
forced Christian philosophers to taKe up
the study of Aristotle. This, he said, was
the internal crusade, more far-reaching in
its effects than the crusades first preached
by Peter the Hermit. He concluded by
saving that this internal eru-ade had
caused a series o: Christian writers to see
that when you get the pnilosophy of the
whole it confirms Christianity.
Professor Howison began "his remarks
by savins that his friend, Commissioner
Harris, had not gone deep enough. He
thought tae time had come for those in
charge of the churches to give more than
a surface meaning o. the symbol.
"When a man >ays to me that Christ
died on the cross for my sins, tiien I can
say it runs contrary to the first principles
of ethics, which is that no man can be
righteous for another."
Professor Howison said that in his opin
ion, instead of saying that Christianity is
revealed, a new and better apologetic for
it is to say that its altruistic qualities are
superior to those of any otner religion
and tbat any man is a Christian who be
lieves in these things â tne divine person
ality, the consciousness of the Divine
Being that he has companions, and that
men are free and that there are other men
whose personality is an end.
When the professor had ended his re
marks he announced his willingness to
answer any quesnons. Lewis the Light,
who had managed to obtain a front seat,
at once sprang to bis fee' and propounded
a question, which Professor Howison,
after asking him to repeat it, began to
answer with all tne art ot* his logic, when
Dr. Minton quickly came to the rescue
by proposing a vote of thanks 10 the
speakers. Lewis the Li^bt, having been
once suppressed, remained quiet for the
rest o; the proceedings.
The questioning was resumed by- Rev.
Dr.- Urruy and had reference to the au
thenticity of Christ's miracles. Professor
Howison replied that he accepted the
philosophical insight of Christ, but did
not think the value of that insieht had
anything to do with the person of Christ.
Questions as to Professor Howison's
standpoint were also asked by Rev. Dr.
Minton. Professor Lloyd and Rev. Dr.
Hallock, but in almost every case the
answers proved that the pastors and Pro
feesor Howison would have to agree to
differ. Commissioner Harris concluded
the discussion by say in j he did not think
philosophy could be a substitute for re
ligion.
Found in the Bay.
The body of Mathew D. Nile, at one time an
employe of S. & G. Gump was found float

morning. The features are past recognition

was accidental.
FOX WANTS TO BE HEARD.
Petition liled to Advance the Suit
Against the Hale & Norcross . . .
Company. ;
A petition was filed yesterday by coun
sel for 31. W. Fox in t!ie Supreme Court,
to advance the case of M. W. Fox against
the Hale & Norcross Silver Mining Com
pany et al. for hearing, to be placed on
the bank calendar for argument at the
January session of the court in this City.
Attention was called to the fact that ap
plication was made to have the cause put
on the calendar for argument at the last
November session of the court held in
Sacramento, and the following statement
was made:
'â¢So it appears that six years have al
ready been consumed in this litigation.
In the meantime assessments upon the
stock of the company have been levied
and collected to an aggregate of over
$600,000 or im:re than $5 5 0 per share."
Thb statement was embodied in the
application for a hearing in November.
In the present application it was added:
"Since the tiline of said application an
other assessment has been levied upon
the capital stock of the Hale & Norcross
Silver Mining Company, amounting to
$28,000, and it is reasonable to suppose,
judging the future by the past, that these
assessments will continue to be levied,
and the question presents itself whether it
would be better for those holding the
stock of this company to abandon all
further efforts to collect from the de
fendants the money declared by the
lower court to be due stock
holders, because of tne wrongs done
them by the defendants, than to be com
pelled to await its collection and advance
assessments from time to time from their
own resources."
It is also set forth that peculiar condi
tions surroun'J this cr.se. A final ju ig
tnent for nearly $300,000 as been awarded.
j but its payment is absolutely prohibited
I and deferred until this appeal is deter
j rrined, notwithstanding tae validity of
I that judgment is in no way involved, and,
\ in the meantime, the beneficiaries are re
quired to pay large sums of money lor
I current expenses on the stock of the com
pany or surrender all right to participate
in the benefits of the judgment.
AERIAL BALLET IN COURT
Judge McKenna to Have Its
Mystrc Intr cacies Ex
plained To- Morrow.
A Working Model of the Machinery
May Be Produced to Better Ex
p'ain Its Workings.
Judge McKenna of the United States
Federal court will be familiarized to-mor.
row with the intricacies of the marvelous
aerial ballet, which has recently become
popular in this City, and there is prospect
of a gathering of notable theatrical people
in the gloomy old Federal building.
The baliet gets into the jurisdiction of
Uncle Sam's representatives in the case of
C. E. Nillson ajrainst C. B. Jefferson, Klaw
& Erlanger, Al Hayman & Co. and A.
Bouvier. Nillson claims to be the in
ventor and patentee of the fairy spectacle
and the delicate machinery that controls
it, and he feels aggrieved at the defendants
in the action that he has brought because
they have used the fruits ot his inventive
genius without consulting him or paying
royalty.
The baliet Is being handled by Nillson
at the Orpheum, where it has drawn
crowded bouses, and the management of
tbe Baldwin recently placed a similar at
traction at that place of amusement.
Nillson claims that the contrivances
used by the defendants are an infringe
ment on his rights and that he has been
damaged to the extent of $20,000 lor this
and other uses to which the appliances
have been put. An injunction and treble
damages are asked.
The movements of the eight young girls
who compose Nillson's ballet at the Or
plieuin are all controlled by the inventor,
who sits in c. saddle-like arrangement
at the back of the s< enes, and by a system
of wires, levers and brakes carries them
through the air as though they floated by
superhuman means.
It is not improbable that a working
model of the machinery will be set up in
Judge McKenna's courtroom, tÂ£ give that
jurist a better understanding of its
mechanism than he could obtain by hear
ing the to v 111011 y of witnesses and the ar
guments of attorneys.
J. J. Scriviner and George Perry repre
sent Nillson and J. J. Raver, who has
taken up the plaintiff's case and is far
ms-ing a portion of the sinews of war
with which to push the case to a conclu
sion. The hearing of the case is expected
to last several days.
Chinese Club Incorporation.
Dozens of Chinese social clubs are being
organized in Chinatown, and quite a number
of them have filed articles of incorporation.
The latest on the list is the San Fraiif i&co
Chinese Literary and Social Club. The incor
porators declare that their purposes are to pro
vide suitable apartments for the reception of
the members of the club and their friends
where they may read, converse, play cards
and otherwise amuse themselves. The organ
izers of the club are: Ah Harm, Ah Kee, Ah
Chung, Ah Ling, Harm Doon and Quing Hong.
Russia is evidently preparing for trouble.

SAFE-CRACKERS
COMMENCE WORK
A Job in a Furniture-
Store on Mission
Street.
Valuable Jewelry, a Gold Coin
and Other Articles
Stolen.
The Detectives Who Are Working
on Ihe Case Think They Have
a Clew.
The first safe-cracking "job" that has
been reported to the police for the past
two years is now being investigated by
Detectives Bee, Harper and Reynolds.
It occurred in the furniture and uphol
stery store of Charles E-icande, 2543 Mis
sion street, near Twenty-eco nd, and two
valuable diamond ring?, a diamond scarf
pin, a gold-dollar piece and other property
were siolen.
The job was done sometime between
last Tuesday and last Saturday. Escande
finds it only neces-ary to op?n (he safe
when be wants to get bis bank book, and
even this necessity did not arise between
those days. Saturday a friend called at
the store and showed him a dollar cold
piece, and asked to see one he had in his
safe to compare their dates.
When Escande opened the safe he saw
at once that it had been tampered with.
A steel drawer in which he kept his bank
book, money and jewe.ry had been forced
open evidently with a cold chisel, and the
jewelry and other articles stolen. Fortu
nately, except the gold dollar, there was
no money in the mawer.
The drawer was kept locked, but the
hinges and screws had been forced off
with the cold chisel, and alter the con
tents had been stolen it was put back in
its place.
VVhat puzzled Escande was that the
outer door of the safe had not. been
tampered with, and this led him to sus
pect that the safe-cracker had known the
combination.
He notified police headquarters of the
job and .Detectives Bee, Harper and
Reynolds were detailed to investigate.
They ascertained from Escande t at a
young man who had been employed iv
the store had left for Mexico Tuesday
morning. At least he told Escande that
morning tbat he was to quit work at once,
as he had received a good offyr to go to
Mexico.
This young man knew the combination,
and had opportunities of doing the job
while in charge of the store during Es
cande's absence. There is nothing against
him beyond his hurried departure osten
sibly for Mexico, and he may not have
done the job.
Tne safe is in the front part of the store
iv full view of the west window. The job
could not have been done during the day or
during business hours at night, as people
passing on the street could see the safe.
When the store is closed, shutters are
placed on the windows, so that in was
easy, to do the job then.
The police suspect tbat thera are safe
crackers in the City, and this accounts for
storekeepers being notified by Chief Crow
ley to keep a light burning at niuht close
to their safes and hay- them in such a posi
tion that the policemen on the beat can
see tiiem either through the windows or
glass doors.
A NEW BALL GAME.
An Eastern Sport That Will Soon Be
Introduced iv This City.
A new outdoor game which has attained
great popularity in the East is to be in
troduced here shortly, and will be played
for the first time at the Velodrome
grounds. It is called pushball, and is not
unlike football in some respects, except
that the ball itself instead of being the
size of the usual pigskin is round and over
six :eet in diameter. The play is always
fast and Eometimes very exciting, es
pecially when a couple of players are
thrown under the ball. The ball when in
flated weighs 120 pounds, yet it can be
moved with a very slight pressure, in fact
a good wind will send it rolling across a
field at a lively rate.
Tbe game is playe ! by two teams of
eight men each, the main purpose of
the game being, as in football, to advance
the ball into the opponents' territory and
finally across the goal line, this being done
by the concentrated shoulder-pushing of
the players. The game is played on a reg
ulation football field, but only forty yards
of the "gridiron's" length is used. The
'ball is placed on the center line and the
players themselves on either side
of it. The center plays directly behind
the ball, with a guard and tackle on each
side of him. Two forwards play "off
side" to brush the opposing players away
from the ball, and the captain or fullback
stands at the same distance behind his
men, directing the play by a code of sig
nals. The pushing is done with t,.0
shoulders entirely, and owing to the rapid
ity of the game the periods of play are
usua.ly not more than two minutes in
length. When time is called the side hav
ing advanced the ball into the other's ter
ritory scores one or more points.
One point is scored if a five-yard advance
has been made, two points if a ten-yard
advance, and Â»a on, until finally, it a
twenty-yard advance has been made, thus
carrvin/ the bail across the goal line, it
counts five points.
The Reliance, Acme, Olympic, Peerless,
Columbia, Manhattan and San Francisco
athletic clubs will make up teams to try
the game as soon as the ball, which is now
on the way from tlifl East, arrives here,
and some exhibition games will be played
to show the pnblic what it is like.

FEDERAL OFFICERS ILL
S. J. Ruddell, E W. Maglin and Cap
tain Provost on the >ick List.
A number of the customs officers are on
the sick list The most serious case is that
of Samuel J. Ruddell, Deputy Surv yor of
the Port, who lives at 12^0 Waller street.
For a long time past Mr. Ruddell has been
ill, and at one time it was feared he would
be obliged to absent himself from his
duties on account oi pneumonia. Hd
rallied from this, but yesterday morning
be was stricken with vertigo. Tbe Deputy
Surveyor was preparing to visit toe steamer
Acapulco and had about completed his
bath when the illness came upon him. At
first it was supposed to be apopiexy, but
the attending physician states it is no
worse than vertigo and that Mr. Ruddell
will be out in a few d;iys.
Captain Provost, who is connected with
the Port Warden's office, is also seriously
ill, suffering from an attack of partial
paralysis.
Deputy United States Naval Officer E.
W. Maslin is confined to his home under
the iioctor's care. He recently sprained
his knee and the injury has taken a serious
and painful turn.

rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotied lines, equal temperature. The
word "hlah" means hl^h barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weatherand rain*.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When ;he pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coas:, and the isobars extend
north ana south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of orecon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
westher may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
Will produce an opposite result-

GREATER OAKLAND
Emeryville's Example Ex
cites the Envy of Its
Neighbors.
County Cierk Jordan Says
"Greater Oakland" Is Only a
Matter of Time.
No Complete Sewerage System Can
Be Built in the Unattacliei
Territory.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call )
908 Broadway, Dec. 21. \
The desire to annex all that territory
between tne northern boundary line of
Oakland and the southern line of Berkeley
that is not included in the new town of
Emeryville is gradually growing Istronger
and "greater Oakland" may soon be more
than a name.
Before the incorporation of Emeryville
a petition was prepared asking the Super
visors to declare an incorporated town the
district that is now Emeryville as well as
the territory some distance out of it.
I When the racing town project was brought
â ^forward with such a rush the original
petition was withdrawn, but the increased
dignity that attaches to the new town has
arouse.i the jealou B y of that territory
which is still unattachel and there is a
growing inclination now that the outlying
district cannot be a town by itself
to be attached to the city of Oakland.
George P. Morrow is one of the prime
movers in favor of annexation and his en
thusiasm is shared by many men equally
prominent and aggressive.
At the present time nolcomplete system
of sewerage, street lighting or any kind of
improvements can be undertaken, and
just as lone as this loose piece of territory
declines to become a portion of a city just
so long will it remain as a section of wil
derness.
"The matter of annexing this territory,"
said County Clerk Jordan today, "is re
ceiving a great deal of attention, and 1 do
not thinit it will be long beiore it becomes
apart of greater Oakland. With an eco
nomical administration the taxes would
not be great and would be as nothing com
pared to the improvements that would
come with incorporation. The opening
up of the two electric roads through that
territory during the past five years and
the building of the new racetrack in the
immediate vicinity have completely
changed the aspect of that portion of the
county. It is rapidly becoming populated
end being divided into streets, and nat
urally when progress once sets in it must
be developed. This district can only be
developed, it seems to me, by incorpora
tion with Oakland. 1 '
WANT THE SMALL END
The Railroad Thinks the County
Shou:d Fay Most for
the Bridge.
Manager Kruttschnitt'i Views and
Plans Will Be Considered by
the Supervisors.
OakLa>*d Office Pan Frawcibco Caix,}
908 Broadway, Dec. 21. )
When the Supervisors met to-day
the first business transacted was the read
ing of an important letter from General
Manager Kruttschnitt of the Southern
Pacific Company. It contained his ideas
and plans regarding the new bridge
across the estuary. According to the
manager's figures, the larger portion of
the expense shuuld be borne by the
county, but to this Supervisor Church
entered ?. strong exception.
The letter is as follows:
fTo the Honorable Board of Supervisors, Oak
land. Alameda Countyâ Gentlemen: I hand
you herewith two blue prints of proposed
Oakland harbor drawbridge, marked "Plan
No. 1" and "Plan No. 2." These are skeleton
outlines of the two plans discussed at our
recent conference. Attached 'hereto are two
estimates of the approximate cost of that
much of the structures as is included be
tween United States Government bulkhead
' lines.
We have used creosoted pine lumber
throughout, excepting only for the wearing
surfaces of the roadways and hand railings,
which would be common lumber, therein foi
ling the practice which has bean followed in
ell our railway work (or some time past. The
oil with which the timber is impregnated, as
you no doubt know, preserves the U nber
from decay and reduces very largely me ex
pease of maintaining the structure. The ex
pense to the county of Alameda outside of Che
United States lines will, of course, be esti
â  mated by you.
The estimate of cost shows it to be consider
ably more expensive to provide for the pas
* sage of steam roads, electric roads, vehicles
** arid pedestrians all on the same level, and
this as well as considerations of safety to life
â¢ and ! property and the necessity of avoiding
delays to the electric and steam care, which
will largely Increase with the growth of the
â¢ cities of Oakland and Alameda, will, I hope,
influence you to abandon the idea of keeping
all the traffic on the same level. No amount
of additional expense could entirely remove
the risk and as our measurements show that
the erade of the highway carried on the upper
chord of the bridge as per plan and estimate 2
is entirely practicable, being but little
ewer 5 per cent, or a rise of five feet in
the hundred, we would most strongly and
respectfully urge on you an acceptance of the
1 general leatures embodied in this design in
order that the detailed estimates of cost may
*be had preliminary to reaching a definite
understanding with yourselves lor financing
the work and pushing it to completion. The
blue prints show that there is no difficulty
' whatever in surmounting the necessary eleva
tion at the rate of grade indicated without en
croaching on the land north of the south line
of First street on the Oakland city side.
As stated to you in our meeting, traffic over
one of the most important bridges in Portland,
Or . is separated in this way, and we have but
recently completed a bridge over the Sacra
mento River at Sacramento, Cal., which is
Â£!o used by the authorities of Sacramento
and Yolo counties as a highway bridge The
grade on that bridge Is nearly 6 per cent, and
ft. use has beei, so satisfactory to the com
munities in question that I would offer you on
Jhe part of the Southern Pacific Company the
courtesies of its lines to visit it, either in a
body Tr through such committee as you may
â¢*Â£Â£&&& favor of a prompt reply, I
remain. rw-JEJgJ* o^cral Manager.
Accompanying the letter were the fol
lowing estimates of cost:
For the double-deck. bridge, providing for
the roadway for steam lines carried on the
lower chords; highway, electric roads and way
for foot passengers, carried on upper chords,
specified as plan "No. 2," total cost $81,289,
$39 994 50 to be paid by the railroad com
pany and *41.204 50 by the county. The cost
>of the draw span for the joint use of the rail-
J Toa.au and public, 347 feet long from center -to
/center of end pins, is $07,389. Of this $50,804
*twin be neeaed for the superstructure and
kl6 585 for the sub-structure. This is divided
between the county and the railroad com
pany evenly, each paying $33,694 50. The
timber trestle approaches between the United
States Government bulKheads, 513 feet of tim
ber tnstle. all of the woodwork of which is
creosoted, except nearing surfaces of roadway
and hond railine, will cost $13,900, whk;hÂ»
apportioned $6300 to the railroad and , $7600
â¢ to the county. to the county Is figured at
The total cost to the county is figured at
â¢$41,294 50 and to the railroad $39,994 50.
Foregoing estimate concerning cos', of "join "
portion of structure and approaches, viz., that
portion between the Unite! States Govern
ment bulkhead lines, each party pa>'jnÃ one
half of that part of the structure which does
not admit of being used in any manner except
Jointly, and all of that part which will be ex
clusively used by them.
The estimate for the other bridge providing
for railroads and foot passengers on the same
level, Bhowfid th- total cost to be $87,061,
divided *4i2,880 50 to the rnllroad company
and $44,180 50 to the county. The steel
draw, 365 ieet long, will cost $s<>, '-"'â¢">
for tin' superstructure and $16,906 for the sub
structure. The timber trestle, 495 leet long,
will Cost $13,900.
When the letter and the estimates were
read, Supervisor Church said: "Can any
member explain to me why the county
should pay more than the railroad when
they use the bridge more than we do?"
'â¢'I think the railroad ought to puv at
least two-tliirJs or three-fourths of the
amount anil the county the short end,"
said Supervisor Juhnstone.
The matter was referred to the commit
tee of the whole for consideration.
THE NEW JUDGE.
Mayor Davie Declines to Say Whether
Ifc Will Bo AVood or
Allen.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 21.â Police Court
circles just now are entirely interested in
the appointment of the next Police Judge.
Fred V. Wood at present fills the office.
At the recent election Wood and J. J. Allen
were re-elected Justices of the Peace and
the Mayor has the option of saying which
one shall act as Polic Judge for the en
suing two years.
There is a strong influence being used
to secure the reappointment of Judge
Wood, and there is also a feeling in cer-
PROFESSOR PETRAY, Principal of the Livermore Grammar
School.
tain circles that the appointment should j
be given to Judge Allen. As regards
honors, the two men and the office are
equal. Allen served a term as Police
Judge and was displaced by ex-Mayor
Pardeetogive place to Wood. Tnis was
contrary to custom, as Allen's majority
was by far tie larger. Now Wood has
completed one term with credit and the
choice between the two men has to be
made again. %
During the past two years Judge Wood
has had an excellent opcortunity to show
his ability, and he has, without doubt,
proved of great assistance to the police in
suppressing the lottery nuisance in this
city. At the present time it can truth
fully be said that a Chinese lottery ticket
I cannot be openly purchased in this city.
I Offenders against the licensing laws have
also been severely but justly treated, and
there are probably less offenders in this
direction to-dny than ever before. Under
these circumstances that peculiar element
of local society which is perhaps best rep
resented by the Christian Endeavor and
the allied unions, including the church
! element, are working hard to secure
' Wood's reappo'ntment.
Mayor Davie stated to-day that he has
; not yet made up his mind regarding the
matter and will not do so for a few days.
He says he is getting very tired of hearine
of the virtues of the respective candidates,
j and that if it were possible it would save
â  him a lot of trouble could he appoint a
! third man.
The appointment of Police Judge car
j ries with it the appointment of a sten-
I ographer and bailiff, as well as clerk of
j the Police Court. These offic s are much
sou. ht after and in the past have been
j tilled as the result of political deals with
! other offices. The discharge of Judge
! Wood's brother from tbe District Attor
ney's office is an indication that the last
deal by which Clerk Crawford was put in
the Police Court is at an end, so that
although Wood, if reappointed, would un
doubtedly retain Stenographer Van Court
land and Bailiff Mitchell, he will probably
make a change in tbe clerkship.

OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 21.â The students

! entertainment at the college last evening
in the presence of the faculty and student
body. Every number of the programme
was a choice selection and rendered with

Davis Opposes the Bill.
OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 21.â Ex-Mayor
Davis, who is the senior counsel for Oak
land in the great water-front suit which
is now pending on appeal in the Supreme
Court, is opposed to the water-front bill
which Assemblyman Frank Leavitt has
announced be will introduce into the next
Legislature. The bill is to repeal the act
of 1852, granting the water front in trust
to the ciiy, and putting it back in the
hand* of the State. In a long opinion on
its demerits Mr. Davis says in conclusion:
The very best thing that the legislative arm
can do is to let the judicial arm proceed to
judgmentâ a thing that has been needed for
over forty years, ar.d that may be obtained
with for ty days. Then, too, this whole diffi
cult and complicated matter is not a thing
that ougnt to be interfered with on the cold

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1896.
WANTS A PLACE
ON THE BOARD
One County School Director
Should Come From the
East End.
Livermore's Citizens Petition the
Supervisors on Behalf of
Principal Petray.
Their District Has Always Baen Ex
c ud. j d From R presentation
on the Board.
Oaklasd Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 21. )
At its first meeting, a:ter organizalion,
the Board of Supervisors who take office
with the coming year will appoint two
members on the County Board of Educa
tion. These appointments are regarded
as of great importance, because the ap-
pointees are clothed with certain powers
by which the local conditions of the dis
trict schools afe controlled.
The eastern portion of Alameda County
has not now nor did it ever have a repre
sentation on the County Board of Educa
tion, and there is now a movement on
foot to secure one of the appointments for
the hitherto neglected part of the county.
The residents of Livermore and neigh
borhood declare that the interests of their
schools can be Dest subserved by the ap-
Dointment of a man who has made a suc
cess in the profession of teaching in both
the grammar and high schools of this
State. In this way every interest in
school matters from the primary grades
to the university would be so perfected
and promoted as to form one continuous
and harmonious course.
It devolves upon the county board to
lay out the course of the study for the
grammar and primary schools, and also
to prescribe rules and examine, the pupils
for examination, as well as to examine
applicants for certificates, fix the grades
thereof and prepare for the annual county
institute. It has generally been the prac
tice to fill these positions with no other
than schoolteachers, but the people in
the eastern part of the county have pub
licly expressed the desire to be repre
sented by Professor H. C. Petray, princi
pal of the Livermore Public School.
Already a voluminously signed petition
containing the nnme of every influential
resident of that section has been prepared
for presentation to the Supervisors. The
petition asserts that not only geographi
cally is that section entitled to a place on
the county board, but that the qualifica
tions of Mr. Petray are also such as to
create a desire to see him a member of the
board.
Mr. Petray is in favor ol nnifying the
courses of study of tbe elementary and
secondary schools, as well as raiding the
standard thereof, and as this method ia rec
ommended in the report of Dr. Brown of
the State University; D. J. Sullivan, City
Superintendent of Alametla; Mrs. Wilson,
principal of the Teni'.scal Grammar
School, and W. H. Langan, principal oi
the San Leandro tchool, it is very prob
able that it may soon be adopted by the
county board.
To Oakland, but Mot Yet.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 21.â A report
having been circulated that the Valley
road was making a survey from this city to
Stockton Vice-President Robert Watt says
that it is rather premature, but is among
the future plans of the road. Mr. Watt
said:
Of course it is our aim to at some future
time extend our road to the bay, but there ia
nothing definite in that regard just at present.
Surveys, perhaps several of them, will have
to bo made belore any definite route is deter
mined upon. Even though we were to begin
ninking our surveys it would not signify a
greAt deal.
Wo :ire more than pleased with our venture
so far. The people of the San Joaquin Valley
Imvi: received us in a spirit that shows they
want a competing road. We did not handle as
much dl tin' wheat shipments this year as we
had expected, as we got into the field a little
late. We have, however, every assurance that
next year we will secure our share of the busi
ness.
Certainly when our road is completed to
this city we will do a much larger business,
but just at this time 1 could not say when that
will be, for we ourselves do not know.
No Place for a Sick Colored Man.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 21. â Ben
O'Brien, the colored nian who threw a
rock at a window to insure being sent to
jail, and who is half dead from sickness,
was denied admission to the County Hos
pital to-dny. Supervisor Church rtad the
law, which says that the use of the re
ceiving hospital shall be reserved solely
for tbe support and care of the indigent
sick and for no other purpose. On this
showing the board declined to admit the
prisoner.
SayÂ» He Was Robbed.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 21.â Stephen
Hotreboorn has reported to the police that
he was held np near Knox place Friday
nigbt and robbed of $91 by two men, one

ALBERT KYNOCK'S HAIR
Following the Wake of His
. Whiskers It Will Leave
Him Bald.
Gangs of Thiev.s Make Away With
Many Valuable Canines From
Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 21.â The case of
Albert Ky nock, the contractor who lost
nis mustache ana beard by it falling out,
is attracting a good deal of attention in
the medical profession. Mr. Kynock 1:0
sooner became used to the beardless con
dition of his face than he found that the
hair of his head was falling out. If it
continues he will soon be bald. .
; "I have not shaved my chin beard for
twenty-three years and it is over thirty
years since my lip was shaved," said Mr.
Kynock this afternoon to a Call repre
sentative, as he worked away on his job.
"Now, you can see for yourself that a
baby's face' could be no smoother than
mine. Why, 1 have lived here thirteen
years and my best friends fail to recognize
me ; when we meet on the street. I find
that the hair is cominjr out of my head.
My physician. does not pretend to know
any. cause lor the phenomenon. If my
blood was bad or if I had any skin trouble

DURRANT'S BRIEF
WAS ADMITTED
At the Same Time the
Attorney - General's
Answer Came.
Durrant Described as Pcssessing
the Ferocity of a
Tiger.
Ten Days' Time Givea the Defenst
lo Answer ai.d Tten ihs Case
Will Be Considered.
The brief prepared by Durrant's attor
neys was admitted to filing in the Su
preme Court yesterday. At the same
time the brief of Attorney-General Fitz
gerald, which has been prepared jointly
by the Attorney-General and by Assistant
Attorney-General Anderson, came in for
tiling. A stipulation was submitted under
which the Attorney-General agreed that
the brief for Durrant should come in and
that ten days' time and no more should be
allowed the deiense in which to answer the
Attorney-General. The order of submis
sion was not set aside. The effect of this
is that the court will decide upon the
merits of Durrani's appeal lor a new trial
within ninety days irom the date of that
order, which wa- October 21 last.
Tne substance of the briel prepared by
the attorneys for Durrant has previously
been published in tnis paper. With that
briei and the brief of tna Attorney-Gen
eial, fa'.eil yesterday, the record is, in the
main, practically made up, and Durrant is
now face to face with what may be the
last chance for ilia iife.
The Attorney-General in the opening
had the following to say in his brief;
At the very threshold of the case we are met
with an elaborate discussion of the evidence.
This di.scu.ss.ou is opened by counsel lor ap
pellant with the assertion that "the verdict is
contrary to the evidence and the evidence is
insufficient to justify the verdict." With this
for tut- lr text they assert a number of particu
lars in wnicn they consider tne evidence iact
ing. Evidently assuming that Uiil court is a
second jury, exercising all a jury's functions,
they proc^L'ii to discuss In detail, not the suffi
ciency ot the evidence, but iiu credibility of
the witnesses who supplied the evidence.
Their, brief iv this particular is a virtual con
cession that ii the jury was justified iv believ
ing the witnesses lor the prosecution tne tes
ninuny given by those witnesses is sufficient
to justify tue verdict; but they say that those
witnesses are not worthy of credence and that
the jury shouid not have believed them.
i'ne principal contention oi the aupe.lan t's
counsel iv this behalf is thut euch and allot
the numerous, witnesses fur the prosecution
who testified positively to the defendant's
whereabouts and movements on the atternoon
of April 3, 1895, must necessarily have been
suffering irom a species of mental aberration,
or hallucination â some fever ot the imagina
tion â because their testimony flatly contra
dicts the unsupported testimony of the de
lendant himself as to his whereabouts and
movement on that fatal afternoon. The tes
timony of the other witnesses for the prosecu
tion is disposed of upon hypotheses equally
satisfactory to counsel for appellant.
All this, of course, has nothing whatever to
do with the legal sufficiency of the evidence.
Its weight and the credibility of the witnesses
were lor the jury. If they believed it this
court cannot disbelieve it. The sole question
for this court, so far as the evidence is con
cerned, is: Conceding the truth of that which
tends to connect the defendant with the com
mission oi the offense charged, is it, being
true, sufficient In the law to sustain the ver
dict oi the jury? That this question should be
answered in the affirmative fully appears from
a consideration of the evidence itself.
All the testimony and all the exceptions
taken by Durrant's attorneys were care
fully reviewed. Concerning Durrant's
movements the Attorney-General said:
Thus all through this April afternoon the
defendant, who believed that he had brought
his victim unobservod and in secret to tne
scene of her death, was watched Dy many
eye?- They were eyes mat had apparently
had nothing in common either with each
other or with the defendant or the deceased
eyes of the curious old German woman, who,
afraid of burglars and restlessly on the look
out for stray housebreakers, earnestly watched
and carefully noted every movement of the
strange young man who for nearly an hour
waited impatiently for Blanche Lamont in
front of the Normal school â eyes of
the deceased schoolgirl's acquaintances,
who noted the defendant carefully,
because he was the young man with
I the new student â the eyes of Mrs'
Crossett, who watched the defendant and bis
young lady companion as closely as possible
for as many blocks as the streetcar carried
him and the unsuspecting girl nearer and
nenrer to the dreadful goal â the sharp-sighted
lawyer's eyes as he patted the young couple,
on the way to keep an appointment, and was
attracted "by the unusuai manner in which
they were walking, and finally, just as the de
fendant is about to enter the gloomy church
with the deceased, where he can perform the
deed unseen by any but the Ail-s>eing, he
passes under the eyes oi Mrs. Leake, watching
at her window for her daughter's return. All
| of tnese â the suspicious old woman at her
I window on Powell street, the schoolgirls
curiously observing their fellow-student's
companion, the old lady returning home
from a day spent with her daughter and
granddaughter, the passing lawyer and Mrs.
Leake at her window opposite the church â
were unconscious actors In this grim tragedy.
! Each going his or her several way, unknown
to each other, and unknown 40 or heeded by
the two central figures, carried away in his or
her memory fragments of a chain of circum
stancesâbroken links of factâ which, when
pieced and welded together at the trial led
irresistibly to the culminating fact that de
fendant and Blanche Lamont entered the
chuich together by the side door between 4
and 4:30 o'clock ou the afternoon of April 3,
1895.
Bi.tnche Lamont never left the church alive.
In less than three-quarters of an hour defend
ant was a murderer. Alone and unseen in the
deep silence oi the empty church he had com
mitted a brutal crime with the deliberation
and ferocity of a tiger.
Under the 90-day rule the decision of
the Supreme Court is due before January
21, 1897, but it may be delayed.
Monlton Is Chairman.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 21.â The com
mittee of twenty-one named by the Re
publican City Central Committee held a
meeting to-night at the Blake-Moffltt
building. It was held behind closed
doors while the principal business was
discussed. It will meet again Wednesday
evening, when the disputed points will
be decided. It is understood that the
committee has decided to perform the
duties delegated to it.
Between now and the next meeting
ward delegations will feel the pulse of
their constituents on tne question of pri
maries. It seems to be the general belief
that it was decided to appoint delegates
and carry out the programme of the City
Central Committee. W. H. Chickering
withdrew from the meeting when he
found the people were not to have a voice
in the matter. D. S. Moulton was made
permanent chairman.
Killed by the Can.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 21.â Henry
Gaudur, a wealthy tallow-melter residing
near the stockyards, was killed by a
main-line train some time this evening.
His residence is on one side of tbe tractc
and his place of business on ths other. It
is presumed he was killed while on his
way home. His absence caused a search
ing party to be organized, and his body,
terribly mangled, was found half a mile
down the track, where, it is believed, it
was carried by the cars that killed him.

PACIFIC-UNION CLUB
The Queotion of Moving to Van Ness
Avenue is Reopened.
The whole question of buying land and
building a house on Van Ness avenue will
be reopened by the Pacific-Union 'Club
at a special meeting this evening. It
appears that the proposition to move out
to the avenue is not entirely acceptable to
the majority of the members.
At a meeting held early in December the
club adopted a resolution by a vote of 63
to 43, to purchase a lot on Van Ness
avenue and build a house thereon. It was
then announced that bonds to the amount
of $250, 0C0 had been subscribed for.
Prior to this meeting the directors had
requested an expression of opinion in
wrning, and postal cards were sent out to
the members. There were 233 responses â
132 opposing the plan and 101 favoring it.

bers asting for a reconsideration of the
resolution was subsequently presented to
the board of directors, and therefore the
special meeting was called to reopen tbe
subject.
There is some talk now of purchasing
the lot on the northwest corner of Powell
and Geary streets. It has been hinted
that desirable land on the northwest
corner of Post and Powell streets might
be obtained.
The meeting to-morrow night will b9
largely attendeii. Every member of the
club has been freely advised of the pro
posed plans. The sentiment in favor of
building a magnificent edifice on Van
Ness avenue is noc confined to the younger
element. Many of the ablest and most
influential men of long experience firmly
advocate the proposition, believing that
the time has arrived for the club to build
a home on the avenue.
Newspaper Profits in London
There was a trial before Justice Cave
last week, which, if correctly reported,
shows what is the profit of the sharehold
ers of the Times. Mr. Adams bought one
fourteenth of two-thirds of one-ninth of
two-sixteenths (or 1-1512) of The Times,
from Mr. Brodie, for Â£353, on the assurance
that this minute share was worth about
Â£25 per annum. According to him, after
he had purchased the share, he found it
only to be worth Â£17 a year. On this he
asked for damages. Tiie jury assessed the
damages at Â£65. Assuming this share to
be worth Â£18 per annum (which seems
about the average value), it is clear that
the net dividend on shares is Â£27,216.
Mr. Adams, believing it to be worth Â£353,
paid for it 14.1 years' purchase. The jury
valued it at Â£238, which, taking tbe an
nual return at Â£18, would be sixteen years'
purchase, making the Times worth Â£435,
-456. This, however, does not quite cor
rectly, I believe, represent value, for Mr.
Walter, as printer, derives a large profit
on an old contract. This contract, in
point of fact, represents what may be
called preference shares, while those of
the shareholders may be termed ordinary
shares, the value of the Times being tbe
sum total of both.â London Truth.

BYRON WATERS WANTED
CATOR FOR U.S. SENATOR
But the Fusionists Were Not Elected and the Cator-
White Programme Was Knocked on
the Head.
His Prediction Did Not Come
True, as Did That of
Mr. Stow.
CONSTEENATION OF MR. BARRY
The Editor of tbe Sar Walked In
Unexpectedly Upon the Leaders
of the Fusion.
In anti-monopoly circles the sincerity
of United States Senator White has been
a topic of discussion for several weeks
pastâ in fact ever since the Senator
made a combination with Thomas V.
Cator to elect Cator to the Senate at the
present session of the Legislature, in re
turn for which favor Cator would throw
the Populist vote for White when Sena
tor White's turn should come round for
re-election.
It is argued by those Democrats who
have lost faith in the Senator that no true
anti-monopoly man could assist in the
election of Cator to the United States Sen
ate as the choice of the Democratic and
Populist parties, or in fact as the choice
of any parties, as he could not be sincere
in his opposition to the funding bill.
Cator's anti-monopoly is mistrusted
because he is believed to be an attorney
for the Southern Pacific Company. It has
been openly charged that when he was
prominent in the Nationalist movement
and denouncing the Spring Valley Water
corporation he went to the legal represen
tative of that corporation and sought to be
appointed special counsel, it has been
ciiarged also that Cator denounced Judge
Magnin when he was making his first
fisht for Congress, and that he surrepti
tiously supported the Southern Pacific
candidate.
As late as last March Cator was em
ployed by the Southern Pacific Company
or on behalf ot that company as attorney
in the case of Ernst H. Furst against Cal
vin B. White, Sheriff of Alameda Cour.ty.
Sneriff White demanded that the law de
partment of the Southern Pacific Com
pany should defend the suit, as the dep- |
uty whose action caused the damage suit
against him was not his employe, but the
railroad's. The raiiroad company con
sented and retained Thomis V. Cator.
Cator's close political intimacy with
George W. Baker, a railroad attorney, I
during tiie last campaign was notorious. I
For these reasons the intimacy of Senator
White and Mr. Cator has grated upon the
nerves of Democrats opposed to the lund
ing bill.
A day or two before the Senator left this
City for Washington the Senator and Mr.
Cator were seen in close and earnest con
sultation in the office of the Palace Hotel.
BystaViders who knew the combination
winked at and nudged one another.
But, horrors! who should come in at
that moment but James H, Barry of the
Star, which has been roasting Cator for
years as a railroad man. Mr. Barry was
dressed as neatly as a retired banker. He
wore a rose in his coat lapel and there was
a smile on his lace when his eyes fell on
White. The nudges and winks multi
p.ied at a furious rate as Mr. Barry
stopped short at the threshold and flushed
to the roots of his hair, either with anger
or suspicion. The Senator and Cator saw
him at that moment, and as the Senator
smilingly greeted the editor of .the Star
Mr. Casor took his leave, walking as if on
air and wearing the usual mask of self
possession. He looked straight over Mr.
Barry's head and seemed to be in a state
or ecstatic contemplation.
James H. Barry was with the commit
tee that waited on Senator White to talk
over a plan of action for the campaign.
The Senator said on that occasion that it
mi^ht be possible to beat the bill by fili
bustering; that such had been the prac
tice in the Senate for many years, and
that to def -at such an infamous measure
as the iunding bill a!most any method
that was not dishonorable should be
adopted. He added that a number or a
goodly number of Senators would be re
quired to carry on a filibustering scheme
successfully, b cause the fight raiglu be a
very protracted one. He was asked if
twenty Senators would be required, and
the Senator replied that the more they
could get the better.
The foregoing is Mr. Barry's statement
of the interview. He denied that Senator
White had snid that twenty Senators
would be required to filibuster. In fart
Mr. Barry appeared to have the most im
plicit confidence in Senator White.
This confidence is not shared in, how
ever, by a.l the members of the Committee
of Fifty. They recall the fact that the
Senator was an attorney for the Southern
Pacific Company up to the time of bis
election to the United Siates Senate, and
his intimacy and job with Cator have
forced them to the belief that Whit^ is a
politician and that he likes his job at
Washington so well that he would accept
even Cator as his colleague in order to go
there.
Byron Waters is a bosom friend of Sena
tor White. Mr. Waters is also a railroad
attorney. He remarked last summer that
Cator ought to go to the United States
Senate. So that it is no wonder that many
people believe that birds of a feather flock
by themselves.
There is, it has been remarked by dis
contented anti-funding bill Democrats, a
singular unanimity between the utterance
of Byron Waters regarding Cator, and the
remark of W. W. Stow some years ago re
garding Senator White; namely, that if
the Democratic party got into power at
the next election Stephen M. White would
be the next United States Senator. The
party did get into power, Mr. White
became Senator, and Mr. Stow's predic
tion, guided perhaps by a certain inner
light, came true. Then followed Mr.
Waters' indorsement of Mr. Cator, but
the Democratic party did not get into
power and Mr. Cator will not be elected
Senator.
The subscription committee of the com
mittee of fifty reports having made en
couraging progress thus far, although it
has only started in on the work. It is ex
pected that the Mayor will call a meeting
of the committee o: fifty about the end of
this weeK or the beginning of next week
and will consider what is best to be done.
It has been decided to send ex-Con
gressman Charles A. Sumner of United
States Postal Telegraph fame to Washing
ton to represent the committee and to
watch the great fiebt on Mr. Hunting
ton's proposition. The committee is also
going to make a vigorous fi. ht in the way
of sending literature to members of Con
gress, setting forth the reasons why the
bill should not be passed. When Senator
White was asked as to his opinion on the
value of literafure in the fight he replied
that it was an exceJlent thing, but that
the pamphlets should be short, for Con
gressmen are vetv busy people and do not
have time toreafl loDg-winded effusions.
Several members of the general commit
tee feel rather anx:ous and unsettled over
the peculiar railroad environment in
which the Senator â eemed to live, move
and have his being. They know that they
can rely on his voice and his vote, but they
would feel more at ease coulu they be
sure that they would have his active, en*
ergetic, determined and successful oppo
sition to the measure.
Senator White has never publicly de
nied that he and Cator were encaged in a
nlot to have Cator and himself elected to
the United States Senate, and because
there seems to be an unbroken chain from
Cator to George W. Baker, Baker to Her
rin of the Southern Pacific law depart
ment, Herrin to Waters and Waters to
White the doubters are very uneasy, and
are hoping that after all appearances may
be deceptive.
Senator Morgan of Alabama in looming
into hii;h favor w ith the opponents of the
funding bill. His strength and earnest
ness will be much relied upon to offset
the apparent baif-heartedness of Senator
White of California.

Dr* A. P. O'Brien was asked by a Call
reporter last night with reference to the
complaint made against him by Superin
tendent Clarkson of the House of Correc
tion.
"As far as the House of Correction is
concerned I must confess that the medical
service we get is of the very smallest kind.
Dr. O'Brien never comes here at all. His
assistant, Dr. McMurdo, is supposed to
have this jail in his special jurisdiction.
He has not been near the place for six
months. We have telephoned and asked
for him repeatedly, but he never responds.
Neither does he give us any satisfaction.
Once, in response to an imperative mes
sage, he sent out Dr. Quinlan to us. This
substitute just looked at the patient and
walked away. I have now 350 men in the
building. There are three cases of conta
gious disease among them, and we con
stantly have a number of minor ailments
among the inmates."
â¢'This complaint does not belong to
me," said Dr. O'Brien in reply. "I never
visit the Branch Jail at ail. My duties are
at the Broadway Jail No. 1 and the
Twenty-sixih-street Hospital. The offi
cers of those institutions have made no
com? laint against me. Jailer Sattler has
said that Dr. O'Brien is as attentive a
physician a* he ever met. When Dr. Mc-
Murdo first wenr into ofib.ee he and 1 both
went out io the branch jails â the female
jail and the branch tna.e jail, of which
Mr. Ciarkson was superintendent. It was
arranged that Dr. McMurdo would go out
whenever he was telephoned for, and this
was done until the saw fit to
cut down his requisitions for drugs. For
that reason he could not dispense any
medicines.
"Last March the attention of the Board
of Health was called to the matter by Dr.
McMurdo informing them that the Super
visors had refused to audit his demands
for dm s and tnat he would refuse to
continue his visits to those public institu
tions until the drugs that he had ordered
were delivered. Thereupon the Board of
Health notified the Supervisors that un
less their physician could have the drugs
ti:at he wished to dispense he would not
be obliged to go tnere any more. The
reason given by the Supervisors for cut
ting down the requisitions was the one
twelfth law, but if the prices charg d and
paid for the drugs were down to the fair
market value of the articles the bills
would not have been more than one
fourth of what they are and the one
twelfth law would have been in no danger
of being infringed. All the drugs used in
Broadway Jail, No. 1, would not exceed
$35 worth at a fa ; r rate."
FATALLY INJURED.
An Unknown Old Lady Knocked Down
by a Runaway Horse at Mis
sion and Fourth.
A respectably dressed old lady was seri
ously if not fatally injured by a runaway
horse on Mission and Fourth streets yes
terday afternoon about 2 o'clock.
A horse hitched to a buggy was stand
ing in front of Cluff Brothers' grocery, 40 !
Fourth street, when the animal took
fright and bolted down Fourth. The old
lady was crossing Mission street, and be
fore she could get out of the way the
horse struck her, dashing her to the
ground.
She was picked up in an unconscious
condition and carried into a store till tbe
amDulance arrived, when she was taken
to the Keceiving Hospital. Dr. Fitz^ib- I
bon found that she had sustained serious i
internal injuries, a lacerated wound on
the scalp and was aiso suffering from
concussion of the brain. He expressed
tbe opinion that her chances of recovery
were very slim.
There was nothing in her pocket to lead |
to her identity, and up to late last
night no one had called at the hospital to
inquire about her.

of age.
Charged With Perjury.
John Quinn, 917 Clay Btreet, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Campbell's court yesterday for
tbe arrest of Lee Sam, a Chinese, on a charge
of perjury. Quinn alleges that on February
20, 1895, Lee bam testified in Judge Hunt's
court tnat he never had in tits possession any
part of $13 301 61 belonging to Quinn, and
that by doing so he perjured himself. -

MANY BRAVE IN AND WOMEN
WANT TO HELP LITTLE CUBA
Letters and Personal Calls From People Who Are
Ready to Give Their Lives for
Freedom.
A Captain Is Ready to Com
mand a Ship and Mrs. Waite
Will Talk Again.
AWAITING WORD FROM PALMER
A Mass-Meeting Will Be Held at an
Early Date to Unify the
Local Forces*
Yesterday was a busy day at the new
Cuban headquarters, 2006 Mason street,
where President John H. Jones and others
are doing all in their power to organize
substantial aid for the insurgents.
A number of letters have been received
from sympathizers and enthusiasts, some
of whom have said they are eager to sail
for the scene of action and do all in their
power, even to offering up their lives to
the god of battles.
"The preliminary steps we nave taken,"
said President Jones yesterday, "have
shown us that sympathy for Cuba only
needs to be crystallized into organization
to become a potent force. We cannot

formulate any definite plans or accom
plish any great purpose until we hear :n
detail from Chief Palmer, who is at the
bead of the junta in New York."
The letters received yesterday came
from all sorts and conditions of men â and
from women. Mrs. Frona Eunice Waite
wrore sipnilying her desire to apeak again
lor the cause of Cuba. Lstters were also
receivea from Ohio, from Moilpsto, from
Petaluma and Other towns. The writer?
all seem to mean what they say, and moat
of them are rea'ly to join any band of de
termined men bent on fighting for little
Cuba.
D. E. Bohannon of 3210 Sacramento
street, is a man who takes a deep interest
in tne question, and he is thoroughly
familiar with the situation, having spent
some time in CuDa several years aero.
The friends of the iocal movement have
made 2006 Mason street temporary head
qoarters with office hours from 12 to I
r. M and from 6 to 7 ?. Â» Their tele
phone number is Biack 2912.
There will be a committee meeting at
headquarters at 2 r. m. on Sunday for the
purpose of arranging for a mass-meeting
of Cuban sympathizers at.an early date.
Captain O. Hammond, with Osiorn <fc
Co.. 27 Nfain street, has offered to com
mand any ship that the band may secure.
Similar offers have come from other
quarters, and the leaders believe there is
no kind of aid that they will fail to get
within the next thirty or sixy days.
"We have every confidence," said Presi
dent Jones iast nignt, "that Mr. Palmer's
reply will warmly thank us for what we
are undertakins, and will give some new
ideas on how we can be of service. This
movement here is similar to the leapius
now formed all over the United States.
There is a large league at Los
Angeles, where there was lately an
enthusiastic meeting, and we have
good reason to believe there will
be even a larger meeting here. Mrs.
Waite may be able to arouse considerable

is well supplied with stereopticon slides,
which show some of the battle scenes and
illustrate the bravery of those who are now
engaged in the arduous struggle for liberty
on Cuban soil."
In addition to the letters received at
headquarters a large number of people
calieu yesterday to inquire as to details.
They were all advised to keep quiet until
word comes from New York, to inform
themselves regarding the dates and places
of forthcoming meetings and give their
moral support only for the present.
Nearly all the callers were brave young
men, who stand ready to risk their lives
in the movement. Faust E. Macherini,
who is a leading spirit in the movement,
assures the public that nobody will be
asked for a cent for any purpose, if at all,
until full credentials come from New
York, with a specific statement of what
the fund is required for and by whom it is
to be disbursed.
The leaders of the movement feel much
encouraged over the words of cheer they
have received from such men as General
Dickinson, Editor Barry, Joseph Leggett
and others. They say they are sure to be
able to do a great deal when they are
once directed from New York, so that
their forces may worJi with concentration
and dispatch toward some tangible pur
pose.

A REVENGEFUL SAILOR.
Harry Wright Makes a Vicious Attack
Up-m 1 hoin nÂ« Cuffley, an Ap
prmitice Boy.
Thomas Cufflev, Â»n- apprentice on the
ship Lismore, lying at the Union-street
wharf, swore to a complaint in Judge
Joachim en's court yesterday for the ar
rest of Harry Wright, a sailor, on the
chaige of battery.
Cuffley tells a story that smacks of the
sensational. He says that Wright was ar
rested in Australia for stealing paint, and
Cuffley was the principal witness against
him. Wrieht was convicted and sen
tenced to three months in jail.
Cuffley rnenntime joined the Lismore at
Newcastle, New South Wales, as an ap
prentice. A day or two after the vessel
sailed Wrigtit, who had concealed himself
on board, was discovered and the captain
made him work as a sailor. Cuffley sus
pected that WrL-ht's object in becoming
a stowaway was to get even with him for
testifying against h.ra, and he kept on his
guard. Wright tried several times to at
tack him. but without success.
The ship arrived here about two weeks
ago and Wright remained on hoard. Sun
day night, while the captain and crew
were on shore, tufflpy wa3 lying in his
bunk, when Wright sneaked in. He
jumped on Cnffley and began beating him
with his lists. (Juffley yelled for help and
Wright ran out of the forecastle," and,
seizing a beiayintr pin, was rusiiing back
to finish Cuffl-y.when the night watchman
on board, hearing Cutiiey's cries, grabbed
hold oi Wrieht, wrenthÂ»d the belaying
pin from him and prevented him from
continuing his onslaught upon the boy.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1896.
JAPAN IN THE
MEDICAL ARENA
Dr. Kurozawa, the First
Japanese Doctor, with a
Japanese Degree.
He Practices and 'Has Estab
lished a Preparatory School
of Therapeutics.
An Athletic Gamaliel at Whose Feet
Little Brown Students Sit
in Veneration.
For years Japan has been sending her
young men to this country that they
might De made into doctors and lawyers.
In due course they have matriculated in
American universities to return immedi
ately to their own country to introduce
Occidental remedies for tbe physical and
civil ills of their native land. This sort of
programme was very nice as long as it
lasted, but there has come a change.
Japan has paid for pretty nearly all the
American professional education it needs,
and, being a thrifty nation, has forthwith
proceeded to profit by its knowledge of
civilized methods.
As a result of this but very few Japanese
are now registered at American colleges.
They are getting their education at home,
and the first graduates of the Japanese
schools are already in this field combat
ing with their American professional
brethren for patronage.
Dr. K. Kurozawa is the first of these
Oriental professionals to pioneer tbe way.
He was one of the first to take his degree
from a Japanese college and has been es
tablished in this City in the practice of his
chosen profession. Since his arrival four
other Japanese physicians have followed,
two of whom are still here taking care of
the health of their own people and en
croaching more or less on tne preserves of
native doctors.
This departure would not be nearly so
noticeable were it not for another lact â
that is the establishment of a college, or
rather a preparatory school of medicine
and surgery, for young Japanese, which
has already a membership of sixteen. Dr.
Kurozawa is at the head of this, and at
his feet the young Japanese liat -n to the
lectures which are to pave the way to
them for entrance into the universities of
their native land.
Dr. Kurozawa, though quite a young
man, has practiced his profession thirteen
years. He began his studies in the hos
pital of the celebrated Dr. Takahashi.
Alter three years of this he entered the
private school known as the Tokyo Sen
mon Medical School. Finishing that he
passed the Japanese Government exam
ination. Dr. Kurozawa then took a post
graduate course under the guidance of Dr.
Goto, easily the greatest physician in
Japan, recently aecorated by both the
Japanese and Chinese Governments for
services rendered to Li Hung Chang after
the attempted assassination of the great
Viceroy.
With this training Dr. Kurozawa came
to this country in 1890 and has tince at
tended to a lucrative practice. He is
president of the local Japanese Medical
Association. He is passionately lond ot
athletics, and in adiition to his profes
sional duties is principal of tbe Japanese
Shoba-Kai Association, of which all the
athletic Japanese of tbe City are mem
bers, and among these are the finest
fencers with the two-handed sword in. the
world.
TORE OUT HER HAIR
John M. Lyons, a Grocer, Charged With
Boating His Wife Honors.
Mrs. Honora Lyons, 612 Leavenworth
street, swore to a complaint in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday morning,
for the arrest of her husband, John M.
Lyons, on a charge of battery.
Mrs. Lyons and her hnsband are joint
proprietors of a grocery. She stated that
about 3 o'clock yesterday morning her
husband came home drunk and began to
abuse her. He tore a handful of hair out
of her head and chased her out of the
house. She took refuge in a drugstore
and the clerk telephoned to the North
End police station and a policeman was
sent to her rescue.
She was taken to the station to be out of
her husband's reach, and yesterday morn
ine she swore to the complaint for his
arrest. He was arrested a few hours
later.

delivered the sermon at the opening of a
short mission at the Holy Cross Church,
on Eddy street between Scott and Devisa
dero, last evening. The church was well
filled.
Rev. Father Gallagher took his theme
from the sending out by ChrUt of his
Apostles. When they bad returned
Christ took them apart and told them to
rest a little while. 8o trie church bids her
children to set apart a few days preceding
Christmas, that they may bring their
minds into the proper condition. Now is
the time for worshipers to ascertain how

they are caring for their souls. When
they care as much for their souls as they
do for their bodies all will be well with
them.
Just about this season, centuries ago,
the Blessed Mother and Jeaus left Naza
reth to go to Bethlehem. The rich, riding
in their carriages, may have scoffed at
them, but they were the souls most be
loved by God of any then upon earth. To
day the query of all true Catholics should
be. "Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do? 1 '
Soldiers retreat to take up a better posi
tion. Worshipers should do the same.
Tbe devil is fighting souls all the time. It
is much harder for a man to damn him
self than to be saved. Men nave to do
violence to themselves to offend God. The
remainder of the address was an appeal to
live a better life.
THE COSMOS CLUB.
Members Talk of Moving to Another
House in Order to Obtain Accom
modations.
Every club has its trials and perplexities,
and now the Cosmos is vexed by the per
versity of its landlord and his refusal to
make such concessions as the members of
the club fancy they should receive. There
is talk of renouncing the existing lease, if
that can be done, and moving into another
house.
The erection of the San Francisco Gas
light Company's new building on Post
street has deprived the rear rooms of the
Cosmos Club of needed light. The wall of
the new building rises above the club
bouse and excludes the light and restricts
the view.
The Cosmos members at one time
hoped that the Pacific Union Club would
buy property in that locality, fronting on
Powell street, and that an agreement for
club consolidation might follow which
would enable the Cosmos to secure the
accommodation desired. The chance for
relief in this direction is now regarded as
slight, hence the members of the Cosmos
are about ready for resolute action. The
club pays a rental of $550 a month, and is
m every respect a desirable tenant. In
view of the large sums of money already
paid, the members believe that the owner
of the property should either reduce the
rent or provide better accommodations for
the club.
INSTALLED IN SPLENDOR
Impressive Ceremony in King
Solomon's Hall, Masonic
Temple.
Hundreds of Laiies Witness the Rite
for the First Timeâ A Flag
P. esentaticn.
Seldom if ever did King Solomon's Hall
in the Masonic Temple in this City contain
such a brilliant gathering as there was
last evening on the occasion of the public
installation of the recently elected officers
of Occidental Lodge No. '22.
The vast hall was draped in pale
blue on which hung garlands of ever
greens and wreaths and bunches of Cali
fornia holly berries. The audience, num
bering nearly 1000, included a large pro
portion of ladies. There were present
also many members of the Order of the
Eastern Star and visitors irona sister
lodges.
The exercises were the opening of the
lodge, prayer by Dr. George H. Jenks, the
vacating of stations by the retiring offi
cers and selections on the piano by Pro
fessor Martinez. Then followed the in
stallation of the officers by Past Master
M. J. Savage, assisted by Past Mabter
B. P. Flint, mar-hal of ceremonies:
Robert ri. Countryman, worshipful
master; Ernest C. Bonner, senior warden;
Edward K. Chapman, junior warden ;
Charles L. HaskelJ, treasurer; Edward F.
Delger, secretary; Wells E. Balcom,
senior deacon; Edward J. Thomas, junior
deacon; George W. Drew, marshal; Wal
ter B. Burner, Henry E. Pennell, stew
ards; Charles O. Schnoor, tyler.
During the very impressive ceremonies
there was a soprano solo by Mrs. Millie
Flynn Wratten; barytone solo, H. J. Simp
son ; contralto solo, Miss Ella McCloskey ;
tenor solo, J. R. Ogilvie; duet, Mrs. Wrat
ten and Miss McCloskey, and instru
mental music by Professor Martinez.
After tbe proclamation by the marshal
Secretary E. F. Deleter, in the absence of
Dr. R. Beverly Cole, presented to the past
master on behalf of the lodge a beautiful
cold watch and fob. This was tbe close of
Past MÂ«ster Savage's second term, and at
the previous installation he received a
jewel appropriate to his office. Before his
term of office closed Worshipful Master
Savage expressed the hope that in the
future the altar would be draped with the
stars and stripes in proof of the patriotism
of the members of the lodge.
Last evenine IT. W. G. Moebus, P. M.,
in a well-timed ?-peech and full of patri
otic eloquence, presented a handsome silk
flag, that was placea on the altar, and tbe
worshipful master, in accepting the gift
said that during his term of office every
one would be required to take the obliga
tion over the American flag. He also said
that while the flag is not a symbol of Ma
sonry, it exercise* a silent influence tend
ing to make the members hotter Masons
and better men.
Short addresses were mad* by grand
commander of the Grand Consistory
Charles L. J. W. Pierce ana Past Grand
Master J. B. Stevens. The latter in bis
address said to the ladies that they had
been invited to witness what sometimes
keeps husbands out till inidnignt and
urged them to allow husbands and
brothers to go to the lodge, "but," he
added, "be sure that they go there," and
in a most solemn manner assured the
ladies that "there is nothing whatever in
the goat story." The exercises closed with
the Uymn, "America."
HER OWN SANTA CLAUS
Mrs. Stanford A>lis Tlnil- She Hny Trail-
fer Property to Herself.
Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford, widow of
the late Senator Leland Stanford, yester
day tied a statement in the Probate Court
setting forth that she, as executrix of the
will cf the deceased, has paid all claims
against the estate, and that there is no
reason why the family residence on Cali
fornia street, now held by her as executrix,
should not be transferred to her as devisee
under the will.
A copy of the will is submitted, showing
that the family residence and all that it
contains was bequeathed to her, and that
no opposition to her reception of the snme
exists. In view of the circumstances Mrs.
Stanford asks that an order of court be
granted directing Jane Lathrop Stanford,
as executrix, to execute all necessary
deeds and conveyances to Jane L. Stan
ford, as devisee under the will, in order to
properly transfer the property to said
devisee.
Judge Coffey will hear the application
at 10 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.

NEW TRIAL GRANTED.
Judge Hunt Gives .Sullivan .Another
Chance Against the Railroad.
Judge Hunt yesterday made an order
granting Frank Sullivan a new trial in his
suit against the Southern' Pacific Railroad
Company. ; On the 21st of v August, 1895, , at
tl.e crossing of Harrison and Twenty-first
streets, in this City, Mr. Sullivan was
severely injured by being struck and run
over by a train belonging to the defendant
corporation. He sued for $75,000 damages,
ana after bearing the testimony a jury
returned a verdict for the company, the
defense being that Sullivan had been
guilty of neg.igence.
Upon examining the record of the trial
Judne Hunt found that he had omitted
certain instructions to the jury which had
been asked for by the plaintiff, Mr. Sulli
van, and which he had a right to demand,
namely, that the train was going at an
excessive rate of speed, and that even if
the plaintiff was guilty of contributory
negligence yet the servants of the corpora
tion either saw the plaintiff or by tne
exercise of reasonable care could have seen
him and could have stopped the train in
time to avert the accident.
Judee Hunt says that he intended to
deliver this instruction in his oral charge
to ttte jury, and having failed to do so
through inadvertence the plaintiff is en
titled to a new trial, which is jjranted
accordingly.
Judge Hebbard's Accusers.
In Judge Daingerfleld's department of the
Superior Court, Judge Dougherty of Santa
Rosa presiding, it was yesterday agreed that
the case oi Frederick Marriott, Thomas S. Wil
liams and others charged with libeling Judge
Hebbard, shall be taken up for trial on the
23d of next month. Mr. Marriott's case will
be heard first.
