Loe Angeles, Ca!., Sept. 27.)
The following: communcation, which
has been ad !ressed to the chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee by
Alva UdeJ of this city, will undoubtedly
create a sensation in political circles
â  throughout the State:
To the Chairman of the Democratic State Central
â  Committeeâ Sir: The joint assembly of the
Thirtieth California Legislature elected
Stephen M. White to represent this State in
the United S.ates Senate. The election of Mr.
â¢ White grew out of a scheme, evidently of his
own planning, by which the Democratic party
of Cali.orma, for the first time in its history,
' in State convention, nominated a candidate
for the United States Senate. This honor Mr.
White secured unto himsslf, and, until he
had received the nomination, his allegiance
' to the Democra:ic party hÂ«d never been ques
tioned. la the year 1879 his father, a life
long Democrat, belted a corrupt management
of the Democracy and was nominated for
\ Governor of the State by the Workingmen.
who constituted the rank and file of the
â¢ Democratic party.
The sagacious son, however, refused to
cna. ; tc:.anco his sire's ambition, and the
senior White was defeated, and passed into hia
grave a disheartened and repudiated poli
tician. "Our Steve" turned his "daddy" down,
and by remaining in the camp of the corrupt
bosses, in effect branded his father as a polit
ical charlatan. In that memorable campaign
Hon. J. J. Ayers, now of Los Angeles, was
nominated on the same ticket with the elder
White, but Stephen, the son. differed, and be
came chnirmnn of the machine convention
. that named Wallace Leach, then of San Diego,
as the proper Democratic Oongressionral
nominee to oppose the ticket headed Dy W. F.
White and J. J. Avers.
The son, thus pitted against his father, was
able to hold the Democratic party in hia polit
ical-talons until he forced his Senatorial nomi
nation in 1892. Then, to gratify his own ambi
tion, one oi the most disgraceful campaigns
that the people of California have ever en
dured was conceived in Iniquity and carried
to its logical results. The most corrupt and
notorious combinations were made. Demo
cratic nominations oi candidates for the State
Legislature were held to be the property of
Stephen M. White and notoriously traded to
an antagonistic organization for votes in the
joint assembly to advance him to the United
â¢ States Senate. In this Congressional district
the Democratic nomination for Congress was
' deliberately bartered to the Populist candidate
for his influence as a lea<lei to see that the
contracts were fulfilled and that the Populists
elected to the Legislature would stay bought.
These Infamous transactions culminated in
the joint assembly on January 18, 1893, when
certain Populists, to esc&pe the contracts they
had corruptly made, openly charged bribery
and corruption, and the record thereof is
notoriously spread on the journal of the joint
assembly.
In view of these things the fact becomes too
serioub to deny that the late Democratic party
of this State belongs to White. It is clearly
his property, and as the owner and the chattel
cannot be merged in the same persou it is ab-
surd to deny that the owner belongs to the
party which be uses as a chattel to puichaee
his own political elevation. Does White be
long to the Democratic party or does the late
Democratic party belong to White? This
question tbe lifelong and deserving Democrat
will seriously consider when he reflects on
the situation and realizes that bis own polit
ical identity as a sovereign citizen is lost In
the possessions bartered and exchanged in
these pernicious transactions.
It was charitable indeed for the Democracy
to silently suffer their principles and their
citizenship to be exchanged like chattels, as
they covertly were in the campaign of 1893.
But to submu to a notorious repetition of the
offense is taxing the enduring patience of
every free-born citizen who cherishes a Demo
cratic principle.
The Senatorial and Congressional matters
are again involved in the present campaign.
The State Senators and Assemblymen to be
elected will choose a successor to George C.
Parkins, and the Senators will vote for a suc
cessor to Senator White The late Populist
State Convention commute! the same error
that the Democracy d;d lour years ago by
nominating a candidate for United States Sen
ator. The honor, if honor it may be called,
was conferred upon one Thomas V. Cator and
now be and Mr. White are attempting to con
summate a notorious deal toelect each other to
the United States Senate. Both practically
own what they claim to be the Populist and
Democratic parties respectively, and both are
driving trades at a rate that would make the
WaU-street Jew turn pale with envy.
Fusion candidates for the Legislature have
been programmed in such manner as would
best suit tne interest* ot Cator and White,
and the Democratic nomination for congress
in this district has been given to a socialistic
protege of T. V. Cator. In these respecta the
trades made in 1892 and 1896 are identical,
except that in the present case there are two
beneficiaries interested in the Senatorial in
.trigues. These things naturally bring us up
to the question: Is either of the political or
ganizations they own the Democratic party?
If not, are both com Dined the Democratic
party? If neither severally nor jointly they
cons'.hute the Democralic party, are sincere
Democrats bound to suffer in tame submission
to the unscrupulous designs ot the socialistic
vendors?
A very large and respectable number of life
lane CemoarkU believe that the dangerous
The San Francisco Call.
doctrines of communism and anarchy are be
ing indorsed and engrafted upon the body
politic through these fusion schemes urged by
office-seeking politicians, who have thereby
betrayed and betrothed the Democracy to the
secret allies of foreign socialism. The schem
ers who urge and support these corrupt com
binations seem to view the nomination of
William J. Bryan, not as a triumph of Demo
crutic principle*, but as a compromise with
communism, and a means by which they might
obtain office and advancement through con
federation with men urging doctrine* antag
onistic to tne principles oi" Democracy. Their
venality and covetous ambition have deprived
the Democracy of Los Angeles County and
other parts of the State of a party organization.
Two factions of socialists have here united,
put forth fie same candidates and under the
direction of Cator and White one laction has
usurped end dishonored the name of Democ
racy. Meanwhile the Democracy of this
county has no organization that adheres to
Democratic principles. Therefore, it is mani
fest tnat Stephen M. White is no longer a
Democrat, but the leader of a faction of men
who pander to the dangerous fa.lacies of for
eign socialism, while veracious history proves
that his faction is nothing more than bis per
sonal chattels, to be traded to T. V. Cator an*
nisfaction for public position* to be filled b>-
Cator and White and their favorite henchmen.
Tnese considerations have urged the pro
visional committee for reorganization of the
Los Angeles Democracy to resolve that the
State committee, of which you are chairman,
be respecttuliy requested, by appropriate
action, to call for the resignation of Stephen
M. White as United States Senator, to the end
that a Democratic Governor may appoint a
worthy Democrat to fill the vacancy thereby
created. We were among the pio eers in the
advocacy of free coinage of silver, and our
adherence to the cause is as firm and patriotic
as the fidelity of aiy man can be when tested
by an unalterable loyalty to the candidacy of
William J. Bryan. But we will not abandon
Democratic principles to gratify the ambition
of Senator White, or of any other man or set
of men. Alva Udell,
Secretary Provisional Committee for Reorgani
zation Los Angeles Democracy.

DEATH IN A TORRENT.
Four Lives Lost by Saturday's Cloud
burst in Texas â Residents Res
cued From Tree tops.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Sept. 27.âRe
ports received to-day from San Marcos,
â which was swept by a cloudburst yester
day, indicate the proDable loss of four
lives. The house in which these people
lived was completely wrecked, and no
trace of their bodies has been found. A
portion of the town is yet covered with
from five to twenty feet of water. All
business is suspended, and the work of re
lief progresses slowly, because the town is
divided by a racing torrent and traffic is
stopped in the flooded district.
Many people, including whole families,
were rescued from treetops to-day by men
in boats. Had the storm occurred at
night the loss of life would have been ap
palling.
The mountain of water seemed to have
been unloosed in the twinkling of an eye.
It swept away railroad embankments,
bridges, buildings and fences, and, pour
ing the mighty volume into the river
couree, caused the stream to rise with a
rapidity which threatened to destroy the
entire city. For a distance of nearly
three-quarters of a mile the International
and Great Northern road track was
washed out, rails and ties being swept for
a great distance away from their original
location. The Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railroad also suffered t c loss of a
long stretcn of track, and both roads lost
several houses and a large quantity of
material along the line.
The damage sustained by the Interna
tional and Great Northern Railway is es
timated at $10,000, while the Missouri,
Kansas and Texas Railroad has sustained
an equally heavy loss, and the loss to the
city and citizens will reach the same
figure, making the total damage $30,000.
SUFFERING IN LIBERIA.
Returned Colonists Tell of Want, Hunger
and Pestilential Ravages in the
African Republic.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 27. â Among
the passengers whom the steamship Waes
land, from ijiverpool, landed here to-day,
were six colored people who were over
joyed at finding themselves again in the
United States.
They were Tay^pr Smith of Forest City,
Ark., his wife and two children and two
friends, and they all had sad stories to
tell of the want, misery and hunger suf
fered by the negro southern colonists who
sailed from Savannah in tiie Laurada last
March to try their fortunes in the black
republic of Liberia.
From the day they landed at Monrovia,
Smith sa>d, until their departure they
were unable to get an hour's work of any
kind. Twenty-five acres of ground was
given them by the Liberian Government,
bat there were no houses to sh-lter them
or their families.
Soon after their arrival the rainy season
began, and with it came a deathly malar
ial fever called by the natives "John Bull
fever," whicn carried away forty 01 the
newcomers, among whom was one of
Smith's children. The disease was still
doing its deadly work when he left for the
United States.
Smith states that nearly every one of the
peisons tak'-'n to Liberia from Savannah
was afflicted with illness and many of
them died. When Smith left, an old
friend, half naked and crippled by dis
ease, hobbled out into the surf to bid him
what they all felt would be a last farewell.
President Chieseman of Liberia and the
missionaries did all they could for the un
fortunates, but the returned colonist says
that, like everybody else, they had very
little money, and there was no money or
work for them.

Rage.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, ' Sept. 27.â Just be
fore dark to-night Edward Wald, a ship
carpenter, residing at 53 Mulberry street,
narrowly escaped lynching at the bands
of an infuriated mob of West Side citizens,
only to lose, his life in the Cuyaho.'a
River, into which be plunged to escape
pursuers.
Wald came home under the influence of
liquor, quarrelled with his wife and finally
struck her. Their 14-year-old son, Ed
ward, seized bis father's arm and asked
him to quit, whereupon the brute became
enraged and threw the boy down the
stairway leading to the street, a distance
of twenty feet. The little fellow screamed
for help and rolled out of the open door
way into the street writhing and frothing
at the mouth.
Dr. C. A. Turner was summoned to at
tend the boy and a crowd quickly col
lected to revenge the brutal outrage. Rev.
John McHale, a Catholic priest, was
hastened to the scene and administered
the last rites of the church to the dying
boy. Meanwhile the crowd increased to a
mob. which was goaded into a fury by the
sight of the helpless child struggling in
convulsions on the pavement until the
clamor for revenee swellpd into an omin
ous roar. An impromptu delegation of
forty forced its way into the house to drag
out me inhuman father and others were
dispatched for a. rope.
Wald had locked himself in a bedroom.
Tne door was broken open and he was
dragged into the street, fighting desper
ately. The police arrived before the rope
appeared. The mob gave battle to the po
lice, determined not to allow Wald to es
cape them. During the scrimmage the
prisoner broke loose from those who were
holding him and ran down an alley to
ward the river. The mob was close at
his heels and when the fugitive reached
the river, knowing ihat his chance for life
was far less than even if captured, plunged
into the cold, muddy water of the Cuya
hogaund was drowned. His body has not
been recovered.
Th* boy will die and the wife's injuries

her, soon filled her and caused her to

Resulting in the Union's Failure
and the Killing of Five
of Its Men.
A SCRAMBLE FOR OLD PLACES
Strikers Will Be Taken Back Where
Discharge otNw Men Is Not
Necessitated*
LEADVILLE, Colo., Bept. 27.â The
great miners' strike, which has kept Lead
ville in a turmoil for nearly two months
and which resulted in the killing of five
men last Monday, and the subsequent
placing of the c ; ty under martial law, is
ended. A meeting of the strikers was
held last night under the supervision of
the militia, and after a stormy session it
was finally decided that the men return
to work at the old schedule prices, provid
ing that the mine owners would agree to
give them their old places. A committee
of tive was appointed to confer with the
mine owners, and it is generally believed
that outside of the one or two mines that
have started up with non-union men, the
old men will be taken back.
The strike was the outcome of the or
ganization of the miners by the Western
Federation of Miners, and as every miner
was a nnion man their demands were re
fused. The miners asked $3 a day for all
classes of workmen, including surfaoe and
underground men. This tbe owners de
clared they would not pay and nearly all
of them closed down, several even allow
ing the pumps to stop. Tue employers re
mained willing to continue paying the
wages which had prevailed up to that
time. Under this scale surface workers
were paid only $2 50. Practically the only
change the union demanded was the ad
vance of these men to $3.
ALMOST A NOTHER PANIC.

LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept. 27.â At 10
o'clock to-night a report came into town
that the guard at tbe water works res
ervoir was being attacked by an armed
force of miners. A few moments later the
report was followed by a rumor that
another party was making an assault
upon the Bohn shaft, which is also under
strong military guard. Trouble was an
ticipated by the militia to-night and every
precaution had been made in advance to
int-et and repel all attacks.
Upon a prompt investigation it was
learned that a tew shots had been fired in
the vicinity of the water works, but no
one was hurt and no attacs upon the party
discovered. The mines under guard re
port by telephone to-night that every
thing is quiet.

HARD WORK SUITS
MAJOR McKINLEY
Strong and Confident After
a Very Laborious
Week.
IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS.
Short, Crisp Talks Will Take
the Place of Exhaustive
Arguments.
PROGRAMME FOR THIS WEEK.
Every Day There Will Bj a Reception
of Delegations, Many From Long
Distances.
CANTON Ohio, Sept. 27.â Major Mc-
Kinley was not in the least fatigued by
his week of hard work, which he closed
with eleven speeches yesterday. He is in
excellent spirits to-day and says he ha 3
not felt better at any time during the
campaign. He remained at home during
tbe morning and spent the afternoon at
his sister-in-law's, Mrs. Barber, where ha
and Mrs. McKinley dined.
Major McKinley expects a week ot
arduous work, but he will not have as
many delegations as he had to receive last
week. Probably the most exacting six
days Df the campaign will be next week,
when there are a large number of big
delegations coming from long distances to
call on the Republican candidate. Major
McKinley seems to thrive on hard work,
and it cannot be seen that the campaign
has in any way impaired his health or
robbed him of his strength. It is hia
purpose to make bis speeches considerably
shorter as delegations increase in number,
and this new plan was resorted to yester
day, when he made eleven speeches.
Major McKinley feels that the campaign
of education has been comprehensive and
thorough on the part of the Republicans,
that the arguments are in the main all
in and that short crisp talks to the people
who come to see him will be effective
and saiisfactory at this stage of the cam
paign. Tuesday and Saturday wiil be in
teresting days this week. On Tuesday a
visit from a large Woman's McKin
ley Club of Cincinnati is expected and on
Saturday the Wheelmen's McKinley and.
Hobart Clubs are expected in Canton.
It is believed that there will be between
8000 and 10,000 wheelmen in the parade
on Saturday. A large delegation of
wheelmen is coming from Chicago and
intermediate poiuts and many are ex
pected from Pittsburg and the East.
Ttiere are six delegations booked for
Saturday, but that number will probably
be doubled before the end of tne week.
Delegations are scheduled as late as Octo
ber 22, and it is likely they will continue
to come until the first day of November.
It is proposed by some of the local leaders
to have a big rally here about the middle
of October and to have a number of
strong speakers present. Major McKin
ley will begin next week's work on Mon
day, when two delegations are to call.
The engagements for the week are as fol
lows:
Mondayâ The citizens of Lisbon, Ohio,
and members of the African M. E. Con
ference.

PALMER AMU BUCKNER.
Pleased With Thtir Jour and the Souna)
Money Outlook.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Sept. 27.âSen
ator Palmer and ex-Governor Buckner
came down from Philadelphia to-day in
their special car, reaching here at half
past 3 o'clock. General Buckner stayed
only a few minutes, continuing on the
fame train to Louisville, bnt General
Palmer, wbo was accompanied by his wife,
son and daughter-in-law, went to the
house of his son-in-law, Edwin G. Crabbe,
a chief of division in the Pension Office,
where he trill stay until to-morrow. His
arrival in Washington was known to only
a few intimate friends, and consequently
veVy few callers disturbed him durins the
evening. He was very cheerful regarding
the political outlook in a general way, al
though declining to commit himself to
any specific numerical claims as to the re
bult of the campaign.
The enthusiasm of the big Baltimore and
Philadelphia audiences, he said, im
pressed him with the strength of the
sound-money feeiing.
To-morrow General Palmer expects to
be busy most of the day with matters con
nected with his Senatorial duties wbich
demand att niion, and he intends to dis
pose of atcumulated mail at his office in
the morning, besides calling at several de
partments. If possible, he will leave to
morrow afternoon for his home at Spring
field, where he will remain the rest of the
campaign, unless unexpectedly called out
by Chairman Bynum ior another tour of
speech-making.
X Milt ASK A POPULISTS.
Middle-of-the Road. Men Meet in State
Convention To-ltay.
LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 27.â T0-morrow's
State convention of the Middle-of-the-
Road Populists will probably not be
largely attended. The party machinery is
entirely in the hands of the fusion faction,
and the followers of C. M. Clark of Lin
coln, who issued the call largely on his
own responsibility, is believed to be small.
The purpose of the convention, as already
outlined, is -to place Bryan and Watson
electors in the field as opposed to those of
Brvan and Sewall. It is doubtful if a
â State ticket is nominated. The attendance
will be confined to near-by counties, and
no arrangements have yet been perfected
for even a temporary organization. The
convention will be called to order at 2:30

ACOBJIS THE SILVERITES.
Professor Zadd of Inle Preacher a Ser
mon on Selfishness. a
NEW HAVEN, Conn., September 27.â
Proiessor Ladd, head of the department
af psychology at Yale, occupied the col
lege pulpit to-day. His sermon was a se
vere censure of selfishness.
Professor Ladd scored tho advocates of
a high protective tariff and the silver
â¢ men. He dwelt on the selfishness of the
politics of to-day. His opinion was that if
the silver-mine owners confessed that their
main anxiety was to sell their silver at a
profit of 40 per cent, and not for the work
ing classe.-, whom they professed to cham
â¢ pion, their followers would soon leave
them. This remark caused something of
a stir, and the reference to the silverites
.'was the talk of the campus to-day.

FEBMENT IN THE FATHERLAND
Caustic Attacks on Gladstone Because
of His Act -Turk sn
o Â»_
[Copyright, 1896,b>- ihefnlted Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Sept. 27.â The anti-
Turkish speech delivered by Mr. Glad
stone at last Thursday's mass-meeting in
Liverpool has been widely published here
and generally commented on by the news
papers, a majority of which speak of the
address unfavorably. The comments show
that the anti-English campaign which tho
German Press has entered into has reached
a high state of inflammation. The North
German Gazette, in its issue to-day, prints
the entire speech, translated verbatim,
and attacks Mr. Gladstone viciously in its
accompanying editorial.
The German papers are also much stung
by the taunts of the Russian journals,
which are asking why it is that Germany,
which has always been parading its mili
tary greatness ana readiness for war, now
shows itself to be more awed than any of
the other powers before the phantasm of
war as a consequence of an attempt to
coerce the Sultan.
These journals continue their taunting
of Germany by declaring that neither
Austria nor Italy betrays such a degree of
nervous eagerness to hinder all practical
steps toward solving the Turkish problem,
yet Germany's interests in the Mediterra
nian are only indirect
The Vossische Zeitung, the most in
dulgent of any of the journals in its crit
icisms, goes no further than to express
the hope that the words of the former
Prime Minister of Great Britain will have
a sobering effect on the Sultan and the
palace clique behind him. At the same time
the Vossische suggests the possibility that
the almost violent language employed by
Gladstone may reawaken the fanaticisms
of the Moslems and th* Armenian revolu
tionists and their followers, leading to the
very results which he so strongly de
nounces. Among the other leading Ger
man papers the consensus of opinion is
that the speech is more likely to encour
age a renewal of the massacres in the Sul
tan's domain.
The National Zeitung and some of the
other journals accuse Mr. Gladstone with
treating a serious situation with levity.
The practical expulsion from Berlin a
few days ago of Professor Thoumayau, the
Armenian lecturer who came to Germany
for the purpose of organizing anti-Turk
ish meetings, has had a tendency to
dampen the purpose of the sympathizers
with the Armenians.
In the official mind Professor Thou
mayan is a mere agitator, who politically
is indistinguishable from the wildest kind
and mofct fanatical Huntchalist or Arme
nian revolutionist. According to the
semi-official version of the Incident, pub
lished in the Cologne Gazette, Professor
Thoumayan owes his life to the German
Embassador to Turkey, who interceded in
his behalf when the professor was sen
tenced to death as a conspirator in Arme
nia and procured a reprieve on the
strength of Tboumayan's promise to aban
don his anti-Turkish sentiment.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that he re
ceived repeated warnings from the Berlin
police, Thoumayan continued bis attacks
upon the Sultan, and his crowning offenoe
was committed in his declaration at a re
cent anarchist meeting that the Porte it
self had arranged the affair of taking pos
session o fthe Ottoman Bank. In recount
ing the details of this incident, however,
the Gazette omits mention of the fact that
Professor Thoumayan went to the meet
ing mentioned in company with a well
known and highly respected Berlin cler
gyman for the main purpose of refuting
tbe statement which had been made in
anarchist oratories that the Armenian
movement was purely anarchistic
Dr. Lindauer, the Anarchibt leader, hav
ing repeated this declaration, Professor
Thoumayan denied tbe truth of the alle
gation with much, warmth. He repudi
ated all connection with the revolutionary
manifesto which had emanated from Lon
don, and having disposed ot this matter,
proceeded to denounce the Sultan and the
higher officials of the Turkish Government.
The meeting was somewhat disturbed by
the professor's expression of his senti
ments, and several speakers who followed
him declared that he was a paid agent of
the Russian secret police.
Professor Thoumayan has not yet been
actually expelled, though he is construc
tively under that ban, he having been in
formed that the threat of his expulsion
from Germany would be immediately exe
cuted if he made another attempt to ad
dress a public meeting.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1896.
cions are expressed within the circles of
the German Colonial party that the Brit

arisen in German East Africa, into which
the vVawemba tribe has made inroads
from Knelish territory. More serious
than this, however, is tbe rising of the
Wahohe tribe, which has rebuilt the fort

TREATED FOR A TUMOR
Frau Klafsky's Death Caused Iby
the Incapacity of Her
Physicians.
The Prima Donna Killed by an Oper
ation Which Proved to Have
Been Unnecessary.
BERLIN, Germany, Sept. 27.â The
death of Frau Katrina Klafsky-Lohse,
tbe prima donna, which occurred in Ham
burg last Tuesday, is greatly regretted
here, and the circumstances attending her
demise are being widely discussed. Her
friends are highly indignant at the med
ical treatment which she received, and
declare that she was the victim of the
incapacity of the Hamburg physicians
who attended her.
Tbe story of the cause of her death has
many versions, but the one most gener
ally accepted is that while-she was sing
ing in the United States she was struck
on the head by a toppling cupboard, which
caused a painful inflammation of the
scalp. She never fully recovered from the
effects of the mishap, and later ths pain
became almost unbearable. The Hamburg
physicians diagnosing the case pro
nounced her atllicted with tumor of the
brain, which could only be relieved by the
operation of trepanning, which the doctors
decided to resort to.
The operation was performed, with the
result that it disproved the tumor theory,
but killed tbe patient. The fact was that
her ailment was really of a comparatively
trifling nature.
Frail Klaf sky's funeral, which took
place at Hamburg on Friday, was at
tended by a large number of her profes
sional and private friends. The body, in
accordance with the wishes of the de
ceat-ed lady, was clothed in the white robe
of penitence worn by her in tbe character
of Elizabeth in "Tannhauser." The
chorus of Mozart's "Magic Flute" was
sung at tbe crave.
Madam Klafsky was the daughter of an
obscure Hungarian shoemaker, and s:ie
married a Jewish tradesman in Leipsic be
fore she became prominent as a singer.
After her marriage she abandoned her
profession, but her husband's failure in
business compelled her to return to the
staÃe, after which she rapidly rose to
celebrity.

last night and went to Mrs. Howard's and
met his wife and Mrs. Morris, the latter of
whom, in Mrs. Howard's absence, has
charge of the household.

tion at the treatment of Irish prisoners in
English prisons, and to awaken sentiment
which shall induce interference in behalf
of the prisoners still remaining there.
A motion that a committee be appointed
to have charge of the caretaking of Thomas
Gallagher and Albert Wiiit-head, two po
litical prisoners who recently arrived here.
was opposed on the ground that it looked
like an effort to get control of the two in
sane men.
It was considered that the motion was a
jump in the dark. This argument was
met by the statement that money had
been received from Ireland for them and
other money had been contributed here,
and it seemed proper that a responsible
committee should be appointed to take
charge of the fund.
It was further said in support of the
plan that an inquiry from Ireland as to
bow the prisoners were getting on or what
was being done with them could not be re
plied to.
Even the members of Mr. Whitehead's
family had been unable to tell where Mr.
Whitenead was when an inquirer had
called at their house.
Finally E. i\ McCrystal, P. J. Byrnes,
C. J. Reilly and James F. Egan were ap
pointed a committee to care for the men.

CONEY ISLAND
RESORT BURNED
Fire Reduces the Famous
Wooden "Elephant"
to Ashes.
POOR WATER SUPPLY.
Firemen Are Hampered in Their
Efforts to Check the Con
flagration.
PASSING OF A NOTED HALL.
S nee Its Erection in 1880 It Had B^en
a Prominent Feature of the
"West End."
CONEY ISLAND. N. V., Sept. 27.â The
sensational event of the season at this
famous summer resort occurred to-night
in the total destruction by fire of the fa
mous wooden "Elephant." This counter
feit presentment of the monarch of the
jungle was the most prominent feature
of the district known as the "West
End," or Coney Island proper. As
the season is over no cause for the fire,
which started about 10:30 p. m., can be
learned.
Having been built many years, the huge
wooden carcass was dry enough to burn
like tinder, and in less than a half hour
the main supports were so weakened that
the whole structure collapsed. The close
proximity of the "Elephant" to the Sea
Beach Palace, a large music-hall, made the
prospect promising for an extensive con
flagration and three alarms were sent out,
bringine fire apparatus from all the sur
rounding district. The danger to the
palace was over as soon as the "Elephant"
collapsed, and it escaped with but slight
damage.
The "Elephant," which has had many
vicissitudes, has been used of late for an
exhibition hall, museum of curios and
restaurant purposes. Originally built in
1880 by a syndicate of Philadelphia capi
talists it has changed hands several times,
the present owners being Hall & Garrison
of Philadelphia.
The loss is about $t>ooo. The effective
work of the firemen was greatly hampered
by poor water supply.
MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE FIRE.
Flames Destroy the Main Structure and the
Gymnasiumâ Much of the Contents
Saved.
SOUTH HADLEY, Mass., Sept. 27.â
The main Mount Holyoke College build
ing was destroyed by fire earJy this even
ing, together with the two wings and the
gynasium. The loss will probably amount
to $200,000.
The fire started under the gynasium
and spread rapidly to the remainder of
the buildinij. The flames were discovered
at 4:45 o'clock. There was not fire pro
tection enough about the building and
assistance was called for, but as the water
had to be pumped nearly half a mile, it
afforded ao check to the flames. Much of
the furniture and contents of the build
ing, including a large part of the students'
property, was saved and no one was in
jured.
To-night most of the students are scat
tered about in the houses of the towns
people, the hotels aud the churches, while
others have gone to Holyoke, Northamp
ton and other near-by points.
Mount Holyoke College is one of the
oldest institutions, if not the oldest for
the education of women, in the United
States. It is the outgrowth of the Mount
Holyoke Seminary, which was founded in
1836 and opened November 8, 1837.
Mary Lyon, an educator whose name is
almost a household word in Massachu
setts and New Hampshire, was the
founder of the seminary, and from the
opening of the institution until her death
in 1849, she was the principal.
The original charter was enlarged in
1883 and the name of the school was
changed to Mount Holyoke Seminary and
ColJece, and again in 1893 a fulljcollege
curriculum was adopted, the charter
was again amended and the name changed
to Mount HoJyoke College. Power was
given to the college to grant any degree
conferred by any college in Massachusetts.
MATCHING GREAT HORSES
Banker Tewksbury Accepts the
Defi of an Australian
Turfman.
Will Pit Robert J /gainst Fritz, tbe
Trotting King of the An*
tipodes.
NEW|YORK, N. V., Sept 27.â A match
between celebrities in the world of trot
ting horses, representing widely different
portions of the globe, is now on the tapis,
and if it can be pulled off will go on record
as one of the notable events of turf annals.
In a recent issue of the Chicago Horse
man George M. Slatel of Sydney, Austra
lia, offers to match his trotter, Fritz,
record 2:14J4, made on a grass track at
Melbourne in March, 1896, against any
trotting horse in the world for $10,000 a
side. The challenge has been taken up by
Banker Lewis G. Tewksbury of this city,
who owns Robert J (2:01VÂ£), Mascot
(2:04), Paul (2:o7}Â£) and other flyers.
In a letter to the Horseman, dated Fri
day, Mr. Tewksbury states the terms under
which he will take his representative
(probably Robert J) to Australia, starting
December 1 next, the race to take place in
six wteks after arrival at Sydney, mile
heats, best three in five, National Trotting
Association of America rules to govern.
Mr. Tewksbnry alsu makes as a counter
proposal that if the Australians will bring
their horse to the United States he can
probably be induced to give them odds of
$20,000 to $10,000 on the event, besides
doubling the allowance they propose for
expenses, which proposal he specifies as
his estimate of the great handicap which
is placed urftn the horse that travels
half around the world and undergoes a
great climatic change.
Mr. Tewksbury asks that the challenger
be requested to cable his acceptance by
November 14, so it may be soon known
whether the battle will take place and
where.

'SPOKANE, Wash., Sept. 27.-8. N.
.Malterner, a well-known hunter and trav

SAN EAFAEL, Cal., Sept. 27.â The
boys of the Mount Tamal i>ais Military
Academy started a grass fire yesterday
afternoon to clear the ground for foot
ball. The fire got away from their control

WEDDED AT ST. HELENA.
Dr. Arnold d'Ancona and Dr. Lillie Mabel
Bussenmo Lock Their Destinies
for Life.
ST. HELENA, Cal., Sept. 27.â A pretty
wedding was celebrated at the bride's
home on Main street to-day when Rev.
James Mitchell tied the knot that binds
the destines of Dr. Arnold d'Ancona and
Dr. Lillie Mabel Bessenino. The parlor
decorations were unique in the extreme.
One could scarcely realize he was within
the confines of stone walls, so artistic
were the arrangements of ferns and flow
ers.
At noon, as if fanned by Cunid's wing
from some nidden nook, the soft refiain
from the wedding roarcu of Lohengrin
ushered in the bridal party two Dride
maids â Misses Eroline and Julia Lesser â
followed by the bride, attended by her tiny
neice currying a basket of ferns and pink
rosebuds met tne groom under a floral
bell suspended under an arch of trembling
hops artistically arranged. The bride's
dress was plain but elegant, of army-blue
broadcloth, adorned with jet and chiffon,
which lent charm to her slender figure.
During the ceremony skilled fingers
played softly, "On Promise Me," and
when the bans were pronounced pealed
forth the grand old favorite wedding
march of Mendelssohn.
A champagne breakfast was served and
many pleasing toasts were offered to the
"two made one." They departed on the
3:20 train for Del Monte, where they will
sojourn for a lew days before taking up
their new residence at 728 Sutter street,
San Francisco.

I never walk about in the town without
being impressed with the ingenuity ol the
small boy. A few afternoons ago I was

Soldiers Home. It w?s rather a hand
some house, with a wide sweep of velvety
lawn, windingly fhtersected by a cement
driveway. A boy of about 14 was cutting
the narrow fringe of grass beside the
driveway. He was mounted on a bicycle
and as he rode he pushed the lawn-mower
along beside him. Of course it was much
harder work than walking with the grass
cutter would have been and a deal slower
in the doing, but no real live boy is ever
going to let such trifling considerations as
those have weight with him.âWashing

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1896.
DUEL FOUGHT
NEAR ALAMO
Teamster Ramon Zumaya
Puts a Mexican Judge
to Flight.
DEFIES COURT ORDERS.
Defends Himself When Justice
Goes Forth to Assert Its
Authority.
RUEAIES IN HIS PURSUIT.
Determined on Capturing the Fugi
tive, Who Stands Adjudged in
Contempt
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 27.â Ramon
Zumaya, a freighter at Alamo, Lower Cali
fornia, is out in the hills with a posse of
ten rurales pursuing him. Zumaya is a
peaceable citizen, but on two occasions
has been drawn into trouble, in which he
developed a rare capacity for taking care
of himself. Both of these affairs were
with Mexican Judges.
On a former occasion Znmaya was sub
jected to gross indignities by a little Judge
who took advantage of his authority, and
Zumaya retaliated by wringing the Judge's
nose, defying a posse that was sent to
apprehend him. He kept the pursuers at
bay for a weet, and by that time the Gov
ernor at Ensenada was acquainted with
the details and ordered the posse off.
The second fracas took place last
Wednesday. Judge Julio Gonzales sent
word for Znmaya to apnear at his court
and pay a fine for an in traction of the
local resulations regarding ore hauling.
Zumaya sent back word that he would not
come, and that the Judge had better give
up any hope of collecting the hne. Judge
Gonzalps got on his horse and started out
to get Zumaya, taking a rifle with which
to enforce the order of the court,
Zumaya heard that the Judge was look
ing for him, and he hurried home and got
his rifle.
He had hardly secured the weapon be
fore Gonzales appeared and a duel began.
Zumaya dodged behind a rock and his
bullets whizzed so close to the Judge's ears
that Gonzaies jumped off his horse and
also sought protection behind a bowluer.
In all fifteen shots were fired. Neither
man was hit.
Gonzales retired and gathered a posse of
ten rurales, and Zumaya took advantage
of the lull in the battle to retreat to trie
woods, where he has been hiding ever
since. The soldiers have located him, but
nave not pressed him very closely. At
last accounts Zumaya was still at large.

Local Horses.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 27. âA big
horserace took place at Real del Castillo,

IF I
We were to attempt to describe our Overcoats,
which occupy two floors, a floor space of Â£9,400
square feet, it would take a dozen pages, and
then it would have to be set in small type to tell
you of all the pretty garments lined with rich
satins, and the pretty way the garments are
made up. To attempt to tell you of these two
floors of Overcoats, ranging in price from $4-0 i
down to $5, would be almost an impossibility.
We're merely going to tell you about one great
big special that we're going to offer to-morrow,
and that, in the language of the day, is a peach.
It's about a coat that has made the big Kearny-
street store famous. '
An Overcoat that has stood four years of un-
abated popularity, an overcoat that has made
fast friends among the best dressers.
An Overcoat that has brought people back to
the store to get another like it again. A Coat
having such a reputation is the coat for you to
wear, is it not ?
That Overcoat is the Royal Kersey of ours. It
has stood the test of time. There is only one dif-
ference between our Royal Kersey of to-day and
that of the previous season. We have put in it
richer linings, finer trimmings, tailored it up to
date, and it looks even handsomer than the
Royal Kersey of last season.
The shades are blue, black and brown, and
some very handsome shades of tan.
You will find these Royal Kersey Overcoats
on the backs of the most stylish dressers in
'Frisco. It's a dressy garment ; it's a fashion-
able garment.

Chesterfield.
And the beauty of it all is that it costs you

Bishop Foss Preaches an
Eloquent Sermon to
Thousands.
LIFE OF THE SAVIOR.
Assembled Methodists Shout
Hallelujahs in His
Name.
TRIBUTES TO THE NAZARENE.
The Grandeur of H s Career on Earth
Pictured in Masterly
Phrase.
Los Angeles Office of The Call,)
S2B Broadway, >
Los Angeles, Cal , Sept. 27.)
The programme in the Southern Califor
nia Methodist Episcopal Conference to
day began' with a love fenst at 9 a. m.,
which was largely attended and partici
pated in by Korea of Methodists who have
grown gray in the cause. At 10:30 the
ordination of deacons took place, and at
11 o'clock Bishop Foss preached a power
ful sermon on "The Life of Christ."
In bis delineation of Christ's wonderful
character Bishop Foss held his audience
spellbound for nearly an hour. The creat
tabernacle was packed not only on the
pulpit floor, but in both balconies, at least
300 people standing throughout the deliv
ery of the sermon. The audience was in
many respects a notable one.
There were half a hundred able minis
ters of the denomination on the platform,
and distributed through the congregation
there were many leading members of the
Los Angeles bar ana grave Judges of the
courts. The medical profession was
largely represented, and scores of leading
business men, editors, reporters and cor
respondents were present.
The great preacher was thoroughly fa
miliar with his topic. lor nearly a half
century he has been preaching and
studying the life of the Savior. As he
warmed to his subject, and in all the
beauties of the English language por
trayed the grandeur, the sublimity and
yet the simplicity of Christ's life on earth,
many o! his hearers were visibly touched
and cave expression to their overwrought
feelings in hallelujahs of praise. Ihe
minister's words and the scene which
they evoked were inspiring. The splen
did panegyric upon the moral and mental
superiority of Christ were echoed back in
hearty amens.
In referring to the death on the cross
the Bishop said that this most revolting
and despised form of execution had been
immortalized into an emblem of Christ's
pure religion. Ihe speaker said he would
glory in seeing that cross on every Prot
estant church throughout the civilized
â¢worlu. Referring to those who still de
nied, or at least pretended to doubt, the
beneficent influence of Christianity in the
world the speaker said one might as well
attempt to deny the existence of Los An
gelep, the Pacific Ocean or the sun.
The Bishop read tributes to the life and
work of Christ from tbe scholars of all
ages, many of them inridels. all of whom
acknowledged his transcendent goodness
and wisdom. His last, his dying words,
were a fitting finale to a blameless life, de
void of a single mistake, when he said,
".rather, forgive them, for they know not
what they ao."
The educational anniversay took place
this evening, during which several promi
nent members of the conference addressed
the people.
Ad> bÂ» Structure* Jiurn*<t.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept 27.â A fire
oi considerable magnitude occurred this
evening on New High street, near Belle-
vue avenue, partially consuming three old
adobe structures, involving a loss of about
$6000. A fireman came in contact with a
live electric wire and was seriously though
not fatally shocked. A network of telei
graph wires near the burning buildings
made it necessary for tbe firemen to cut a
large number of Western Union wires
leading out of the city.
BUGLE CALLS HARMONIZED.
Army and Navy Will Use the Same Melo
dies Hereafter to Avoid Confusion.
There are no occasions worthy of the
slightest feeling in which music is not
u?ed. A practical yet interesting way of
using melodies is the issuing of orders in
the army and navy.
In all time previous to last week the
orders of the army and navy In action
were unlike. In a case of the coast crew
being called ashore the confusion arising
from the navy not knowing the orders of
the army can perhaps be imagined better
than described, but a committee have been
at work investigating and adjusting mat
ters so that like bugle directions
for both army and navy have been
established and sanctioned by the {signa
ture of the Secretary of War.
In the infantry, cavalry and light artil
lery the "first call," "guard mounting,"
"full dress," "overcoats," "drill,"
"stable," "water." "boots and saddles,"
"assembly," "adjutant's call," "fire," "to
arms," "to horse," "reveille," "retreat,"
"tattoo." "taps." "mess" and "sick," all
these are the same. The call for "church"
of the "light artillery" is quite a different
melody, and more suggestive of sacred
music than the cavalry or infantry calls.
Then the light infantry have a call to
quarters which the others have not.
Of course the arill signals differ in the
three divisions of the army, as their duties
are different. "Attention" and "halt"
are the Fame. Any order of "front,"
"right.' 1 "rise," is begun low and ends
high :. in "rear," "left" and "lie down"
the chord becomes a cadence, that is, it
ends low.
"The "Rogues' March" has something
in the melody which sounds mocking and
quite enough to discourage the poor fel
low who, by some act, is drummed out of
camp. "Are you not ashamed?" fits the
first strain quite well.
The navy seems to be governed by the
individual trumpeter, excepting the
"reveille," "morning colors," "retreat,"
"evening colors," "tattoo" and "extin
guish lights," which are used by all ships
of war, but all other orders, calls or sig
nals are of each ship's own devising. For
instance, a ship called "Polly" baa for one
of its calls "Polly, pat the kettle on" ; so
that should part of a crew be transferred
from one ship to another their orders
would be as Greek to the visitors.
The expression of "piping" is a call to
listen for orders or to breakfast. The
boatswain's whistle is used for this, and it
may mean a change of smoking hour. It
is to call attention to the order. The
sailors go to and retreat from quarters by
fife and dram. "Fire" in action is j sig
naled by bell or gong â that is. alarm of
fir*â song i* also need for quick alarm at
night â 
Long toll of dram and gong is the same
as tattoo. Tbe stirring strains of 'â¢assem
bly" often Rive courage to a company
almost disorganized. The "quickstep
gives the weary feet strength when the
body is unable to do without it. But
music has such power with the human
frame that we wonder why it is not con
sidered of greater importance than it is,
not only esthetically, but scientitically. â

STATE PERQUISITES.
Some Privileges Which Havn the Au-
thority in ngland of Old Liiwi.
There are at the present day many per
quisites which a high official of state may
claim for himself, and some of these are
both valuable and curious, says London
Tid-bits. At the coronation of George IV
many claims were received, all of which
wÂ«?re duly considered and "allowed" or
"disallowed." The .Lord Great C amber
lain, for instance, in the person of the
Duke of Ancaster, claimed for himself all
the wearing apparel that the King wore
tbe night before his coronation and the
furniture of the room in which he 6lept,
besides the ri>:ht to wash tbe King's hands
in the baÂ»in before the banquet, a silver
basin and ewer and forty yards ot crimson
velvet. Thes* claims were commuted for
the sum of Â£200.
The chief butler at a coronation may
claim a cup of pure gold and the Lord
Mayor has the right to assist him by
handing him a cup ol wine, afterward
keeping the cup for himself.
The chief larderer at a coronation may
claim the remains of the feast and these
were taken possession of by Lord Aber
gavenny at the coronation of George IV.
The sergeant of the scullery's share In
the proceedings consists of all the plate
that has been used ai the feast, but this is
generally commuted for a sum of money.
Heralds in the old day? came in for
many good things. At a royal christen
ing, for instance, they were entitled to ail
the mantles, warming pans, cloths, pil
lows, basins and ewers that might be in
use, together with the right to can three
times for largesse.
'â¢Spur money" was a very common form
of perquisite in the olden days, and even
now the choristersof St. Paul's may claim
the royal *purs at installations ana tbe
annual feast of St. George. At the time
when St. Paul's Cathedral was a place of
public promenade the cuoristers were at
liberty to pounce on any knight wearing
spurs and demand his money. He was
exempt from th 8 fine, however, it tbe
youngest of them present failed to repeat
his gamut correctly when challenged. It
is said that the Duke of Wellington
escaped in this way.
HE GOT EVEN.
Congressman Culberson Plays a Practi-
cal Joke Upon Tom \* illiains.
The story of the Alabama lawsuit in
volving a jack, in which Congressman
Tom Williams of Alabama and Judge Cul
berson of Texas appeared upon opposite
sides and the use the former made of it in
a campaign has been published, but the
sequel never was, says the Washington
Star.
Congressman Williams and Robert G.
Ingersoll resemble each other very closely,
the only point of very noticeable dis
similarity beinc a slierht scar upon Colonel
Ingersoll's face. When Congressman
Williams tod the lawsuit story Judge
Cu.berson concluded to get even. Procur
ing two dozen lithographs of Ingersoil,
used by him in his lecture tours, ihe Judge
cut off the name and signed them in imi
tation of Williams' writing: "Very truly
yours, Tom L. Williams,''
These heaenttomen in different parts
of the Alabama District, being careful to
le.ive out the most influential friends 'of
Williams, in a short time the scheme be
gan to work. Williams received letters
asking for one of his big pictures. These
he answered graciously, saying that he
had none. Then would come bacK replies
in tbe most indignant style telling him
that they had seen them and that if he
wanted to lie about it he oould do without
their support. These letters Mr. Williams
referred to his friend, Judge Culberson.
who advised him to go home and
straighten it out. This the perplexed
member did, obtaining a ten-day leave of
absence. When he returned he said to the
Judse:
"I found them there, framed and hung
up. They looked like me and there was
my signature. Finally I noticed the scar
on tbe face and that saved me. I got it
fixed up, but 1 had to go to every county
in the district."
Finally it leaked out who played the
joke and a compact was made tnat Wil
liams should never again mention the
lawsuit and Judge Culberson should play
no more joke*.
TO TEST THE BATTERY.
General Miles May Inspect the
Dynamite Guns at the
Presidio To-Day.
Fifth Artillery Regiment Still En
tertains a Slight Hcpe of Re
maining Here.
Major-General Miles, commanding the
United States army, was at Del Monte yes
terday. He will probably visit the Pre
sidio this ait- moon and inspect the dyna
mite and mortar batteries and look at the
12-mch rifles on the hill above Fort Point.
Tne hope is still entertained by officers
and enlisted men of the Fifth Artillery
that orders for the transfer of the troops
may be still further modified so as to per
mit the regiment to remain three years
more in this department.
Major Wells Willard is announced as
chief commissary of this department, re
lieving Major Charles S. Eagan, commis
sary of subsistence.
Lieutenant Sydney A. Cloman, First In
fantry, hab been directed to report to the
commanding officer at Fort Mason ' for
temporary duty at that post, relieving
Lieutenant Albert C. Blunt, Fifth Ar
tillery.
Lieutenant George A. Detchmendy, First
In.'antry, has been ordered to report to
the commanding officer at Alcatraz for
temporary duty at that post.
A general court-martial will convene at
An^el Island to-morrow. Following is de
tail for the court: Maj ir Benjamin F.
Pope (surgeon), Capttin Francis E. Pierce,
John J. O'Connell, Cuaiies G. Starr, First
Infantry, and Lieutenants Leon S. Roud
rez, Richard C. Croxton and Charles L.
Bent, First Infantry.
Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson V. D. Mid
dleton, deputy surgeon-general ; Major
Wells Willard, commissary of subsistence,
and Lieutenant Frank 'Greene, signal
corps, have been directed to inventory and
submit required returns of the public
property or funds in charge of the late
Captain Addison Barrett, military store
keeper.
Lieutenant John D. Miley, Fifth Artil
lery, relieves Captain Oscar F. Long, as
sistant quartermaster at the Presidio.
Furloughs have been granted to John
Hallizan, Battery F, Fifth Artillery ;
James L. Webb, Company H, First In
fantry, and Sergeant Albert Jang, Com
pany D, First Infantry.
. On leaving the Presidio for New York
the Fifth Artillery cannot take away the
fixtures, library and equipment of tne Pre
sidio Club, as the officers of the Fourth
Cavalry have a joint interest in the club
property. When the First Artillery left
this post six years ago the club property
belonged to the regimental mess and went
with the regiment. A suitable arrange
ment of some kind may be made for a
transfer of the Fifth 'Artillery's interest in
trie Presidio Club's property to the coming
officers^ the Third Artillery.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1896.
CITIZEN SOLDIERS
OF THE STATE.
Colonel D. B. Fairbanks, Fifth Infantry;
Colonel J. J. Nunan, Sixth Infantry, and
Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. Currier of the
division staff met as a uniform and equip
ment Doard last Monday evening. The
officers composing this boaid will make
diligent inquiry to ascertain what the
various organizations of the guard require
in order to render the f>>rce efficient for
active service in the lield. Facts have
already come to the knowledge of the
board that many of the old Springfield
rifles are unserviceable. It is known that
the Benicia Arsenal contains excellent
Springfield rifles which were turned in
when the regular troops received the Krag-
Jorgen^en army rifles, and a special effort
will be made to have a sufficient number
of the returned rifles reissued to render
the National Guard equipment complete
in this respect.
The bonrd appointed to examine officers
recently appointed to the staff of Major
general James consists of General Jobn
H. Dickin-on, retired. Colonel W. P. Sul
livan, retired, and Colonel D. B. Fair
banks, Fifth Infantry. The division staff
officers will no (onkter languish for their
commissions and the opportunity to ren
der service.
Leave of absence has been granted to F.
S. Cbadbourne, colonel and paymaster
general on the Governor's staff.
First Brigade.
The resignations of Thomas Ncrney,
lieutenant-colonel of the Seventh Infan
try, and George L. Carter, second lieuten
ant, Company C, Seventh Infantry, have
been accepted.
SALINAS, Cal., Sept. 25.â An unusual
amount of interest has been manifested
among the members of Troop C for the
past two months. The troop has been
drilling four nights a week and show a
marked improvement in their evolutions,
and particularly in their saber move
ments. While at mounted drill last week
the troop executed the extended-order
drill, the charge as foragers and other
cavalry movements. The charge as for
agers created no little excitement, when
the trooo came charging down the hill
side at full gallop, the boys yelling like
Indians and executing the different cuts
and thrusts against an imaginary enemy,
their movements causing the old war vet
erans to exclaim that it looked more like
reality tuan a mere drill. Drills each
evening are pieceded by the settine-up
exercises, ending with guard mounting
The members of the troop were very
much disappointed at not being able to
get into iheir armory the 2-itti inst., as
they haa made every arrangements for
celebrating the event wth a fine exhibi
tion drill in the new armory hall. The
drill hall of the armory is surrounded by
a low gallery and is excellently arranged
for iving exhibition drills.
Since tbe semi-annual target practice,
which took place last Thursday, the offi
cers of the troop have given three med
als for three classes â A, B and C, to be
shot for the coming month, and no li. tie
rivalry will be shown as to who shall be
the victors. Captain Burke is determined
that Troop C shall be an honor to the
State and he is sparing no pains to do
everything that shall promote the effi
ciency of the troop. Several members
have been discharged and their places
filled only by those who will take an in
terer t In the welfare of the troop.
Tiie average attendance at weekly drills
is about 70 pt-r cent. As a result of the
target shoot about twenty-five will qualify
for bronze medals and four for silver med
als. The troop has not yet been supplied
with carbines and tbe scores were all made
witti the 3S-caliber Colt's revolvers. The
majority of the members of the troop are
accustomed to rifle shooting. The revol
ver is something new to them and another
year will show a vast improvement in
thÂ«-ir scores.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Sept. 24.â
The semi-annual target practice of Com
pany X, Seventh Infantry, took place at
the D-street range to-day under the super
vision of Lieutenant H. H. Sinclair, in
spector of rifle practice of the Seventh
Regiment. Tne day has been a periect
one for target practice and the scores
made show that the interest in tnis branch
of a soldier's duties is not neglected by
od K. Sergeant Paarce and Frivase Hol
comb tied for the company medal with a
score of 43 each. Private Holcomb will,
however, wear the metal, as Sergeant
Pearce's score contains two 3s, which
gives the medal to Holcomb. Following

out of a possible 50 points, thereby quali
fying for the sharpshooters' gold bar. Mr.
Case is the only one in this section of tbe
State so far this year to get in line for this
honor, and is now eligible to compete for
the State championship at the contest
which will be held in Sacramento as Â«oon
as tbe various companies have completed
their local work.
All the scores given were made with the
regulation Springfield 45.70 rifles over
Cre^dmore ranges and targets at 200 yards.
Company E will shoot at Banta Paula to

day. The highest score, 40. was m;tde by
Captain H. D. Alfonso, adjutant of the
reg ment. In the contest of non-commis
sioned officers Regimental Quanermaster
serpeant Daniel Clark made a score of 10
straights, a rare record.
Politics is beginning to warm up in the
regiment over the election of a lieutenant
colonel which will prooably take place in
October. The possible candidates are Ma
jor J. W. F. Diss, brigade inspector of
San Bernardino, and Captain W. G.
Scbreiber of Company A, Los Angeles.
BAN DIEGO, Cal., B<>pt. 27.â The
members of Company B. Seventh Regi
ment, N. G. C, are making great prepa
rations to celebrate the fifteenth anniver
sary of the company on Obtobor 15. Com
pany B is one of the oldest military or
ganizations in Southern California and
us itacdard oi efficiency has always been
high. It was organized first as the City
Guard and lived a short time as an inde
pendent company, when it was mustered
into tbe National Guard by Major James
A. Gibson of the brigade stjff, mustering
officer. This event occurred on October
15. 1881, and its anniversary will be one
of the most pleasing celebrations of a
military character ever given in the city.
The company had for its first Captain
Douglas Gunn, afterward Mayor of the
city.
During the fifteen years intervening
three captains have served and the pres
ent captain, R. V. Dodge, :a as popular as
any of his predecessor*. He is post
master of San Diego and a royal good fel
low. The boys are in full accord, enthusi
astic over their work and proud of their
record as the crack company in the State
in the way of drilling. At last week's
monthly inspection and dance the celebra
tion was discussed and preparations made
to bold a bie dance and exhibition drill
with other features. The State shoot was
held last Monday and some good snooting
done, considering the fact that a sharp
wui.i was blowing. The average score
per man was 30.34 and the hiehest score
was made by Corporal Smith, 42. Nearly
half of the men will get medals or bars for
marksmanship,;
The State s oot of the third division,
Naval Battalion, was held Friday and
yesterday. A nasty wind was blowing on
the range Friday which prevented high
scoring, but yesterday there was good
shooting. Petty Officer Rapier and Sea
man Robinson tied, each making 43. The
average of the company was high.
Second Brigade.
The resignation of W. F. Chipman,
commanding Company G, Fifth Infantry,
has been accepted.
Leave of absence for ninety days has
been granted to J. P. Duun, major and
surgeon, Fifth Infantry.
The First Infantry, as a compact regi
ment of twelve companies and three bat
talions, is getting into good shape. Spe
cial attention is paid to battalion drills,
and much improvement is noticeable.
On account of removal or expiration of
term o: service the following enlisted men
have been discharged: Riciiard L. board,
William H. Donnelly, John J. Donahue,
Charl s E. Kelly, Robert E. Laws, N. V.

Colonel Wiiliam Macdonald has re
turned from the springs and is on duty
again as regimental commander.
Cantain Bums MacdonaM, formerly of
the Seconii Artillery, has returned from a
trip to England, Scotland and the conti
nent oi Europe. He was absent eighteen
months, and derived much pleasure and
instruction from tbe tour.
Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce is taking an
active part in plans for promoting athletic
contests in the First Infantry. The field
athletics in the United States army have
been ao successful that leading National
Guard officers have no hesitation in rec
ommending that guardsmen follow the
example of regular soldiers.
T.e First Infantry was not largely rep
resented in the State shoot at Shell Mound
Park last Saturday. Tbe rule prohibiting
marKamen who fell below a certain point
at the preliminary shoot to compete in
the linal contest diminished the attend
ance. F. J. Connor, Company F, stored
43. Meyer o: < ompany C scored 46, Par
inalle and Waltham of the same com
pany made 45 each. Baumgarten and
Ptrry of Company B each scored 45. Cap
tain Sutliffe and Corporal Hirst of Com
pany G each scored 43.
Company A, Fifth Infantry, was at the
ranee during the aiternoon. Summers
scored 46 and Cleveland 45.
Third Brigade.
Leave of absence for ninety days has
been granted to Frank A. Elliott, first
lieutenant of Company A, Sixth Infantry.
The resignation of C. E. Small, captain
Company A, Second Infantry, has been
accepted.
Upon his personal application William
B. Maydwell, engineer officer Third Bri
â  gade, has been placed on the retired list
, with the rank of major.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 25 âEver
since the close of the State Fair there has
' ; been an increased interest manifested
j among the members of the National
\ Guard and drills have been more than
i well attended. Company G will go to
i Woodland October 2 for a three days'
camp and will hold its twenty-sixth an-
I nual ball October 26. Company E will go
out for a short camp in the latter part of
tbe month.
Troop E will shortly make a practice
march to Woodland, taking three days'
provender for tbe horses ana three lays'
rations. The men expect to receive new
38-caliber Colt's revolvers and regulation
I carbines within a short lime, and some of
I the members claim that new haversacks
and canteens are badly needed. They as
sert that the troop has as yet received no
aid from the State, altboug i they have
been in commission for over a year. They
claim to be a poorly armol, having neither
regulation revolvers nor equipments and no
carbines, their saddles are of the old artil
| lery type, and there is great lack of am
munition for practice, while they pos
sess a full complement of targets newly
purchased. During the present month
the new non-commissioned officers of tne
troop will be appointed to fill vacancies
and the school for their instruction in
I formation and evolution of the troop will
open Monday night. In connection with
the local companies the troop win hold its
annual target practice on Saturday and
will give its complimentary ball on or
about Christmas.
The findings of the court-martial, pre
sided over by Captain Shoemaker of Com
pany F to investiuate charges pref- rred
against Privates Walter Pierce and Dor
sey P. Luttrell of Company G, for neg
lecting to attend drills and target prac
tices, are that both men be dishonorably
discharged from the ranks of the National
Guard of the Siate of California. Thia
finding having been approved by Colonel
J. W. Guthrie means di^francbisement of
the men fora year. unless they obtain a
pardon from Governor Budd, and it is
hardly thought that the Governor will in
teriere. Colonel Guthrie as issued orders
for another court-martial, to convene on
the 28th inst., for the trial of such charges
as may be brought before it. Captain R.
E. Steams of Company G will preside.
At the weekly target practice the fol
lowing scores were made: Captain Shoe

Ex-Sergeant Charles J. Atwater, Signal
Corps, whose trrra of service has just ex
pired, has gonÂ« to Boston for a few weeks'
stay. At the Bttttng of the Signal Corps
on Tuesday evening Lieutenant Martin
appointed Corporal J. H. Walking to fill
the vacancy In the third sergeantship
vice C. J. Atwater, term expired. Charles
W. Taylor was promoted to corporalship.
It has been decided by tbe corps to have
a moun ed outing on October 4. Wood
land will be the rendezvous of the corps.
Saber, flag and heliograph work will be in
order. The semi-annual shoot, it is ex
pected, will take place in the near future.
and the boys have been busy at the range
the last two Sundays.
Lieutenant Martin is in receipt of a few
copies of the new army code card, known
as "The Myer System for United States
Army and Navy Signaling," prescribed
tor the United States Army and Navy by
G. O. No. 32. A. G. 0., 1896. Having been
already adopted in the regular army the
National Guards of the various States will
probably have- to follow suit. A peculiarity
in this code, which is possibly an advan
tage in this respect over the Morse system,
is the entire absence of the "space" in the
alphabet and numerals, these characters
being composed of left and right motions
and short flashes alone for the flag and
heliograph, respectively. The short fl^sh
will be made with the heliograph as for
merly ; instead of a long flash, two short
flashes in quick succession are used, and
the space is denoted by a long, steady
flash.
MERCED. Cal.. Sept. 24.â Company H,
Sixth Infantry, held its regular monthly
company shoot at its range last Sunday.
There was a good attendance, many being
anxious to practice as much as possible
before the State shoot, which will be held
next Friday. The scores made were good
average shooting, most of which would en
.ab.e the marksmen to qualify for decora
tions if made at an official practice. First
Sergeant Harper led the list with forty
tive points. Hi 3 score contained the re
markable run of eight consecutive bull's
eyes, the first shot was a 2 and the last a
3. Private Fred T. Griffith came next with
forty-three. If practicing means anything
there will be a good many good even scores
made on Friday.
An outfit of meat-ration cans bas been
received at the armory. Little by little
the companies aie getting to.ether a com
plete field outfit. What the State troops
need more than anything else ]ust now is
a supply of overcoats, blankets and a
Buzzacott oven for each company. With
these added to their equipment they would
be almost in condition to take the field for
any emergency.
VISALIA, Cal., Sept. 24.â The records
of Company E, Sixth Infantry, show that
the first commissioned officers were L. V.
Nanscawen, captain; M. J. Byrnes, first
lieutenant, and George W. Stewart, second
lieutenant. On the retirement of Captain
Nanscawen, M. J. Byrnes was elected cap
tain, which position be held for seven
years, which entitled him to be placed on
the retired list with the rank of captain.
George W. Stewart during that time was
his first lieutenant. M. P. Frazier, C. S.
Richardson and J. T. Walker occupied the
positions of second lieutenants daring
Captain Byrnes' command.
Just before the expiration of Captain
Byrnes' time J. T. Walker was elected as
first lieutenant and N. W. Kibler second
lieutenant. On the resignation of Lieu
tenant Walker, Lieutenant Kibler was
elected to his place and F. W. Ward was
elected second lieutenant. On the retire
ment of Cantain Byrnes, F. W. Ward, the
present captain, was elected, with Lieu
tenant Kibler as first and G. L. Adam as
second lieutenant.
The following have been promoted from
the ranks of Company E at various times:
J. C. Ward, first lieutenant and commis
sary; M. P. Frazier, first lieutenant and
battalion adjutant: M. P. Frazier, captain
and adjutant ; E. F. Van Valer. first lieu
tenant and inspector of rifle practice; A.
S. Gilliam, first lieutenant and battalion
adjutantâ all of the Sixth Regiment. C.
A. B^rry. major and commissary; and G.
W. Stewart, major and quartermaster of
the Third Brigade. Charles H. Murphy,
major on General Warrield's staff ; C. T.
Rogers is one of the li atenants on the
regimental staff in New Mexico. The last
promotion was that of W. G. Dozier as
first lieut nant and battalion adjutant.
The regular semi-annual shoot for State
decorations takes place on the 26tb. A
large number will get medals. Rumor
has it that F, the crack company of
Fresno, will try to make a showing at its
regular shoot, and if the result be satis
factory it proposes to challenge a team
from Company E.
The non-commissioned officers of Com
pany E ar- going to have a little time
Tuesday evening after the regular drill.
General Graham, commanding officer of
the Presidio, is expected to make a visit to
the camps of Troops C and I in the near
future.
Preparations are now on foot to organ
ize a signal corps among the members of
Company E.
WOODLAND, Cal., Sept. 24.â The mem
bers of Company F, Second Infantry, will
hold their regular semi-annual State shoot
for decorations October 10. Thr interes;
in this shoot is on the increase, principally
among the new members, as they all want

MARKET 54| STREET.
Well in this branch, and by spring will be
one of the best-drilled companies in tbe
guard. They were drilled by signals, in
a short time they will commence to drill
by the bugle.
The company at the present time has
better material in its ranks and is on a
better footing than it lias ever been since
its organization. This is owing to the
efforts of Captain H. N. Prindle. seconded
by Lieutenants Ward and Utting and the
prompt attendance of men in the ranks.
The non-commissioned officers are a
soldierly lot of men and are doing all in
their power to make Company F the best
dnlled company in the guard. Every
thing in and about tbe armory i 3 carried
on strictly to rule as observed in the
United States army at the present time.
Tbe "man target was introduced here
two weeks ago and the scores made are
something remarkable, as the "man tar
get" is a very deceptive piece of furniture
to shoot at. The scores were from 38 to
57, out of a possible 60 points.
Captain Prindle leads, with a score of
57. Adjutant J. G. Lee comes next, with
56 to his credit. Several of the men have
on down to 38. Considering the shortness
of tbe time, these scores are remarkable.
Adjutant Lee is also a good shot with the
pistol, and if nothing happens will make
the crack shots of the State shoot as they
have nevtr siiot before to beat him.
The following chances and promotions
were announced Wednesday evening:
Second Sergeant Mossmayer to first ser
geant,- Third Sergeant Heval to second
sergeant, Corporal Rawson to third ser
geant, Corporal Hilliker to fourth ser
geant, Serjeant Peart to fifth sergeant,
Private Hink to corporal, Private Keller
to corporal, Private Roberts to corporal
and Private Blair to corporal,
The changes and promotions were well
deserved and reflect great credit on Cap
tain Prindle for his selections.
The monthly social hops of Company F
will commence Thursday evening, Oc
tober 1, and continue through the winter*
They will be strictly military in all re
spects and will beheld in the armory. All
visiting members of tbe guard will receive
a cordial welcome and everything will be
done to make tueir stay agreeable. The
armory of Company F is one of tbe finest
in the State ami excelled by only a tew in
the United States. The main hail is l2ox
60 feet, with a gallery the entire distance
around. It is lighted by electricity and
gas.
It would be a grand scheme for the
higher officials of the National Guard to
take a trip of inspection to the country
and see what their country cousins are
doing on military lines. In that way they
would be better prepared to know what is
needed the most and act accordingly.
That Is the only way in which they can
satisfy themselves of the real needs of the
guard.
The regular drill night of Company F is
Wednesday. The school for non-commis
sioned officers is also held the same
evening.
TALES WITH TENNYSON.
How Some of the Great Poet's Most
i among Lines Were Suggested to Him.
Wilfrid Ward, who was on terms of
great intimacy with Tennyson, writes a
very interesting article in the New Review
entitled "Talks With Tennyson." From
this we learn how some of the most fa
mous of tbe laureate's poems took shape
in his mind.
One remark which Tennyson made to
Mr. Ward was imm diately afterward em-
Oodied in eight lines of great beauty.
"Walking one day on the down which
stretches from Freshwater Bay to the
Freshwater beacon his conversation was
chiefly on two subjects. One wa* the mad
lawlessness of tbe Celtic character * * â¢
and the other all the mass of confuaion
I and crime which a great town brought to
j pettier. * â¦ â¢ About half way between
I Freshwater Bay and the beacon he sud
denly stopped and pointed with his stick
to a star, quite visible, though it was al
most daylight. 'Do you see tnat star?' he
asked in his abrupt way. 'It is the even
ing star. Do you know if we lived there
this world would look to us exactly like
that? Fancy the vice and confusion of
London or Paris in that peaceful star.'
He looked again at the star with an ex
pression half of horror, half of grim
humor. We walked on."
Mr. Ward did not know at the time that
Tennyson was writing the second "Locks
ley Hall," and it was with a curious sen
sation that he read afterward the exquisite
lines which the walk had apparently sug
gested.
An exceedingly interesting portion of
Mr. Ward's article is the account he gives
of Tennyson's explanations and reading
his poem, "De Profundis." He was very
ill at the time, but his mind was quite
clear, bays Mr. Ward:
"He seemed so much better when he
had finished his explanation t.-at I asked
him to read the poem through again.
This he did, more beautifully than I have
ever heard him read. I felt as though his
long illness and his expectation of death
gave more intensity and force to his ren
dering of this wouderful poem on the mys
tery of life."

A Lively Day's Sport on the
â¢ Shell Mound Rifle
Range.
MASON'S FINE SCORE
Dr. L. 0. Rodgers Wins the Ger
."â¢' mania Club's Bullseye
Gold Medal.
; A NOVICE WITH A MUSKET.
F. H. Bushnell Astonishes His Friends
With the Big Military
Firearm.
There was target shooting of all kinds at
the fchell Mound rifle range yesterday,
â¢ fine rifle, musket, pistol and revolver
' . keeping up a merry din from early in the
mornine until sundown. A number of
very good scores were made by the mem
bers of the several military companies and
â¢ hooting clubs.
The attendance at the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club's â¢ regular meeting was
larger than usual. At the request of the
club Captain Siebe, the proprietor of the
.. range, has made many improvements for
the accommodation of the marksmen.
. T"wo new targets on the west end of the
range have been set aside for the use of
the club, and a high partition now divides
the Columbias from the rest of the range.
These improvements have been made in
anticipation, to some extent, of the ad
vent of the ladies to membership in the
organization.
A number of excellent scores were made
and several were a surprise to the older
members.
For example F. H. Bushnell, who re
cently joined the club, took up the musket
for the first time. His first score, Creed
moor count on the Columbia target, was
42, his second 43, third 44 (recorded) and
fourth 46. This performance tor a novice
â¢ was regarded as phenomenal. In pistol
. shooting Mr. Bushneil has gone to the
iront ranks, in a very short space of time.
F. O. Young managed to hold his own
vitd the musket, making 5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4,
6, 5, 5â47. Dr. Rodgers, on the record
medal, ran up a pretty score, Columbia
target, with 7. 6, 5, 4. 6, 1, 4, 7, 11, 3â54.
There is a lively competition among the
ladiea, who shoot the 22-cadber rifles at
. fifty yards, for the Glindermann trophy.
â¢ The hignest score of ten shots made be
tween July and ttie end of the year will
win the prize. For several weeks past
Mrs. L. J. Crane has been in the lead with
; fc score of 33 points, Columbia target,
â¢ which shows an average of shots within
a 3 M-10 inch circle.
Yer-ierviay Mrs. M. J. White lowered tbe
record by averat, r in>; her ten shots within
a .wo and three-fifths inch circle on a score
â¢pf 4, L, 1, 1, 3. 2. 3, 6, 2, 3â26.
F. IT. Alason made a score that h'- does
not like to think about. Alter making 68
. in ten shots on the rifle record medal he
ran up a practice score of 34, or a score of
twice the value of the first. Now he is
' quietly kicking himself because his 34 fs
not on record.
While a large amount of shooting was
done with the pistol none of the previous
records were broken. On both ranges the
following scores were made:
. Rifle, 200 yrrds, Unfred diamond medal

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1896.
CHASED A RABBIT
STUFFED WITH HAY
New Sport Inaugurated at
the Presidio Athletic
Grounds.
LIVE GAME NOT NEEDED
Fifty Officers of ihe Prevention
of Cruelty Society Were
Present
FUN WITH FOX - TERRIEBS.
A Great Day's Sport Enjoyed Without
the Slightest S- mb'.ance of Any
Law-Breaking.
Sixteen weary rabbits, longing to be re
lieved of life, peeked through the bars of
their corral yesterday at tbe Presidio
athletic grounds, as though trying to
pick out which particular fox - terrier
among a half hundred present would be
his executioner.
It was the usual outing of the San Fran
cisco Fox- Terrier Coursing Club, and great
sport was anticipated. The rabbits bad
been brought here from Tulare County,
and after a couple of days' feeding, it was
decided they were in condition to easily
evade a pack of fox-terriers. Under ordi
nary circumstances they might have done
this quite easily, but after the jolting of a
freight-car for a couple of hundred miles,
they were still weary and unambitious to
dodge away from the festive dogs.
But they were not unprotected. Fifty
members of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals backed up
against the corral and threatened with
arrest any person who should attempt to
take a rabbit into the Meld.
In the absence of live rabbits the club
inaugurated a new sport which is quite
likely to supersede the original game. It
is the running of a stuffed hare by the
dogs. To do t is an Inverted bicycie with
the tire off one of the wheels was located
at one end of the field. A string, wound
around the tireless wheel, stretched 125
yards off, where it was tied to a stuffed
bare.
The "winder" or wheelman waited for
the signal and began turning the wheel so
as to haul in the string and the rabbit
which the do^s tried to overtake.
In one instance only did the terriers
reach the game, and they tore it to pieces,
brtaking up the day's sport, there being
but one dummy on hand.
Following were the dogs that took prizes
in tbe different matches:
First race âH. Partington's Punch, Joe

As a prelude to his address Dr. Birch

classes for instruction would be conducted
in Metropolitan Hall Sunday afternoons,
The Star Is Where Ah Quee Came in Contact With the Marble Floor
of the Bouquet Saloon and Became Insane After Recovering
Consciousness*
when the hall could be engaged for that
purpose.
The pastor's text for the evening was
St. Lute xi :2. "Â£onie people think of
God," he said, "as of an almighty ghost,
to be bribed as one might briDe a Turkish
desDot. Only to those who know him is
he always pleasant. Jesus never spoke
of the Almighty as God â it was always
My Father, Our Father, Your Father.
Every human creature can draw near to
the Almighty, because he is father.
"Are we compromising our sense of
right? Are we acting rightly on tbe
Lord's day and wrongly on the morrow?
Havine this knowledpe that God is our
father, let us not only act rightly toward
our fellow-men, but let vi have the feeling
of brotherhood. Let us not forsret that
Jesus Christ entirely abrogated the ten
commandments. He jrave us a new com
mandment that took their place. He did
not say 'Love God.' He knew that when
they knew him as Father they would love
him.
"I am very sorry to learn that there are
so many men in this City unable to obtain
work. lam sorry that men have to work
on Sunday, while 150 men can find no
work on week days. Why cannot the
work be a little more evenly divided. We
have a great deal to remedy before we can
live together as brothers.
'We need to teach this doctrine: 'God
is Father. Ye employers, ye workmen, ye
are brothers. Dare to act as brothers in
everything you do.' It i- possible, necause
Our Father will not ask us to iio the im
possible."
ANNA SHAW ON VISIONS.
They Are One's Ambitions, the Keys
to Greatness.
Rev. Anna H. Shaw addressed an un
usually large audience yesterday after
noon in the l r . M. C. A. Auditorium.
She took for her text, "I was not dis
obedient to the heavenly vision," and in
developing a line of thousht trom that
declared that "there never will be a strong
man or a strong woman who does not fol
low a vision; there never has been a great
man or a creat woman that has not fol
lowed a vision."
The vision is tbe ambition of the indi
vidual; it iÂ« the goal he has set in ad
vance of him and hopes to attain. The
difference between Saul of Tarsus, who
was religious but not a Christian, and
Paul, who liad a vision of Christ and
modeled hi- life by it, is the difference
between the religious man and the true
Christian.
"The difference," remarked Miss Shaw,
"between the little ottice-boy entering an
office with the ambition of eventually
dying a Judgp, and theiiitle office-boy en
tering an otiice and eventually dying a
janitor, is the difference between the boy
with a vision and a boy without a vision."
Miss Shaw will ppÂ»ak to-ni>rht in Ala
meda before the Brotnerhood of the Con
gregational church. To-morrow sh- will
address a meeting: in Cniistoea. Wednes
day she will speak in Napa, and Thursday
(woman's night at the fair), she will speak
before the thousands in the Mechanic's
Pavilion. Friday she will appear in tbe
Unity Church, Oakland.
Next Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock Mrs.
Ballington Booth will address the meet
ing in the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium, and
that means another great audience.
A Clnb of the Old-Fashlo'ned Sort.
Time was when the death of the proprie
tress of Boodle's Club, in St. James street,
would have awakened no slight sensation
at the West End, especially as Miss Gay
ner. who has just passed away, and her
father, who die d two or three years since,
bel onged to the class of club proprietors
which sprang into existence at the begin
ning of last century, and first made the
names of Almack aud Brook s lamous.
"Other times, other manners," says the
old proverb, and now there is hardly a
ciub in London w hich does not belong to
its old members. B oodle's, however, stilt
remained the pr operty of a single iudivid
ual, and Mr. Gayner and his daughter
were noted for the generous treatment
which tbey extended to the members of
an institution conducted on the easy-going
terms which were universally in fashion
some forty or fifty years ago. A member
might dine at Boodle's as often as he
liked â and novi here were both dinner and
wine better â without any reference being
made to payment until he asked for hi.s
account. Formerly the place was regarded
as the Headquarters for masters of fox
hounds, and every hunting dispute was
settled there by a committee.â London

DRIVEN INSANE
BY A HARD FALL
Ah Quee Took a Tumble
From a Ladder Twenty-
Feet High.
HE LOST HIS REASON.
A Friend Obj cted to His Being
Treated by an American
Doctor.
PLACED IS A STRAITJACKET.
A Chinese Servant's Mishap Causes
Him to Run Amuck in a
Saloon
Ah Quee, a Chinese servant, in every
respect entitled to a letter of recommen
dation as such until yesterday morning at
8 o'clock, is new a ravine maniac at his
home, 905 Stockton street, where his
cousin has him in a straitjacket.
The unfortunate heathen was terribly
"Knocked," as the saying is, about that
hour, and be has not been able as yet to
eet over it, and it is probable he will not
live until morning.
This state of affairs is the outcome of
the Chinaman's own carelessness, which
resulted in a fall from the top of a twenty
foot ladder to the marble floor of the
Bouquet oaloon, at G34 Market street.
Thomas Shaw, tUe proprietor of the
place, employed Quee yesterday morning
for the first time, to do certain weekly
cleaning up about the place, and indicated
to him just what his work was to be. He
started in upon it immediately, using the
stepladder from which he fell.
He had neglected to spread the ladder
to tne fullest extent allowed by tbe string,
and his weight caused it to slide on the
marble tiles. As soon as the slide began
the Chinaman began to topple, causing
bot ti himself and his support to fall.
Ah Quee's head and left shoulder struck
first, considerably damaging the former
and dislocating the latter. He lay there
for tw nty minutes in an unconscious
condition while every effort was being
made to restore him to consciousness.
Another Chinaman in the house brought
out and burned punks and papers conse
crated to some heathen deity, believing
his country man to be far past the safety
line on the way to the other world.
Finally Quoe showed signs of recovery.
Shaw, who is a tender-hearted man,
shouted to a bystander:
â¢â¢Run over and get Dr. Whitney at the
Palace Hotel 1"
Before the physician could be reached.
Ah Quee's countryman declared himself
in positive terms to the effect that no
American doctor could take care of his
friend.
"Me take him China doctor," he as
serted. He rang up for a carriage and
began preparing the wounded man for his
journey.
About this time Ah Quee was on his
feet. He was wild-eyed and vicious look
ing. Suddenly he rushed for the saloon
counter, and in a frenzied manner ripped,
tore and broke everything on which he
could lay his hands. He was weak from
loss of blood and generally broken up
from his fall, so it did not require much
exertion to subdue him.
He was driven away to his home at 905
Stockton street, where his countrymen
are trying to restore him to health and
reason.
HANDBALL COURTS.
The .'Amateur. Champion ' and George
Hutch Defeat the Coast
' Champion and P. Kelly. '
The handball courts were well patron
ized yesterday. At the San Francisco
court P. T. Donnelly, the amateur cham
pion, and George Hutchinson played a
rattling game against John Riordan, the
coast champion, and P. Kelly. Donnelly
never played a more scientific game, and
displayed rare judgment. He and nis
partner won after a close and exciting
struggle, the final being decided by the

A number of new players wera present
at the Union court, and handled the ball
with dexterity. A few are rapidly coming
to the front, and will soon be able to try
conclusions with some of the old-timers.
The event of the Â«iay was a game between
J. Rogers and J. Lavigne, the former win
ning two games out ot three. Terry Mc-
Manus, the heavy-weight champion, was

WON'T DISCUSS POLITICS.
But Mr. de Young Asks Questions aud
Uetendfi His Curios.
"No," said M. H. de Young, yesterday ;
"I have absolutely refused to be inter
viewed on politics. The Examiner faked
up an interview with me this morning,
but I said only a few words to the re
porter when I arrived from the East last
night, and not one word was about poli
tics.
"What do you think about the local
situation ?
"They tell me this town will go Repub
lican by 5000 majority, and that means
a great deal for a Presidential year."
While in London recently Mr. de Young
ordered "made for the Park Museum of
this City facsimiles of the seals of the
King -of England and repiicas of some
rareE^yptian stones and sarcophagi, all
of which, as orieinals, are in the British
Museum.
There are sixty royal seals in all. but
some of them are very imperfect. About
forty, comprising the best and greatest,
will be carefully reproduced in whatever
substance the originals were impressed in,
be it sulphur, wax or some other plastic
material.
"it will take time to reproduce them,"
said Mr. de Young, "for the English have
a way of going about such things very de
liberately. Why, I have been a year at
those fellows on this very matter. In ad
dition to the kings' seals I have ordered
gold-plated replicas ot old Roman goll
coins, some of them worth xOOO guineas
apiece.
"These are some of the things that have
been slightingly refe:red to as tne 'girn
cracks' I was collecting. Well, tbe great
British Museum is rilled with such gim
cracks and it is mighty proud of them.
Where it is impossible to get an original
it is sufficient to the connoisseur, to the
lover oi art, to possess a perfect facsimile;
it furnishes the object lesson and may be
studied. In the British Museum there are
plenty of replicas of line specimens in the
French. Museum, and they are done in
plaster, too. Then the Manchester and
Liverpool museums and othere have
replicas from the British Museum. They
are labeled replica, and the people know
what they stand for.
"Now wnen I was in Europe once before
I collected 300 or 400 ancient knives and
forks and nearly 1000 keys for the Park
Museum. None of them have yet been ar
ranged for exhibition out there.
"It takes- time to build up a museum
and every little counts*. If we had nad
even the nucleus of one fifteen years ago
we would have had a fine museum to-day.
I had a tine collection of stuffed birds, but
several years ago we tired of them. There
was no one I could give them to and there
was no public museum. As a last resort I
turned them over to an auctioneer and
after the incidental expenses were paid I
got $23."
The tramways of Great Britain and Ire
land receive in fares annually at the pres
ent time about Â£2.600 000, and tne omni
buses about Â£2,000.000. There are about
45,000 cabs in tne United Kingdom, which
altogether earn in fares about Â£8,200,000
per annum.

There are too many weak, broken down
mothers, wives and sisters wrecked" in

of only temporary < assistance, and
nothing but new vitality can restore
the weakened functions to their nor-

FROM A MOTHER.
DR. A. T. SANDKNâ Dear Sir: I bought your
Belt in August last for nervous pru-trati..n,
etc. I was so bad that many nights 1 could not
sleep. I would get so nervous that I could not
hold my head up. I lound relief almost as
soon as J applied the Belt, and to-day am as
well as any woman of my age. I can say for
your Belt that ii I was not able to get another
one I would not sell mine for $200. Yours

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
KI.K.CTION XOVEMBKR S. 1896.
The most pressing money question is
â¢. that of wages for the people and a revenue
for tne Government.
Wandering Willie must have gone to
New England for his health. There are
no votes for hhn there.
. . There can be no question that Bryanism
is rapidly' dying out in California. The
campaign of education has given the
people a fair understanding of the situ
ation.-
â¢ We must restore the protective system
'. â  before we undertake any other legislation.
' - The labor of this country has already
waited too long for a return of work and
â¢ \ wages.
" â¢ The people of San Francisco cannot af
â¢'â¢ ford to make experiments in the Mayor's
j .office, and will, therefore, vote for Super
. visor Taylor, whom they have tried and
found equal to every test of ollicial
McKinley talks of patriotism and the
-general welfare, while Bryan talks of sec
tionalism and the strife of classes, and it
.: is for the people to decide which kind of
talk is most appropriate in a man who
desires to be President.
When the people know that distrust,
' panic and industrial disturbance began
with tbe election of a free-trade Congress
and a free-traae President, it i 3 impossible
. for Democratic -orators to get them to be-
Jieve that free trade had nothing to do
â¢ with it.
* If those European duke: and counts
who telegraphed congratulations to Bryan
were really sincere in the belief that free
silver coinage would be beneficial to the
â¢country that undertook it they would try
it at home and get the beuefit for their
own people.
Men who wish work, men who wish bet
ter wages, men who wish profits on their
industry are all interested in the tariff,
and that issue, therefore, despite all tbat
Democratic dodgers may do, will remain
' in the hands of the people as one of the
most important to be decided at the
coming election.
The workingmen of this country will
never vote for a man who seeks the Presi-
dency by trying to array one section
, against another or one class of citizens
against another. They, like all patriots,
are in faVor of a President who will act for
the welfare of the whole country and of
all the people.
The workingmen of this country know
by experience that a restoration of the
protective system will open the mills and
give them good wages, but they cannot
. see any benefit in free trade and iree sil-
ver, and what is more, Bryan in all his
speeches has never explained how there
could be such benefits.
James D. Phelan is an excellent man iv
private life, but he has never been tried in
olÃce like Charles L. Taylor, and no one
knows how far his official action will
be controlled by the men who nominated
him. Besides, what could he do with a
Board of Supervisors nominated and con
trolled, as it will be, by Boss Kainey ?
Republicans have reason to be gratified
â¢ with tbe way the Stale Central Commit
tee has managed the conduct of the cam
paign." Under the guidance of Chairman
McLaughlin the canvass has been carried
on with vigor and earnestness and thepartv
organization made more effective than
'ever before. We may count California for
McKinley.
The exports of American products and
manufactures during the first fifteen
months- of the Gorman tariff were $220,
-353,000 less than the exports under the
o like period of the operation of the McKin
ley tariff and as this loss of trade corre
sponded with the opening of our markets
to foreign goods is it any wonoer that
times became hard and money ceased to
circulate?
â¢ . The people of Galesburg, 111., have ar
ranged fora great meeting on October 7 to
commemorate the anniversary of the
famous Lincoln and Douglas debate at
â  that place, and while it is intended to be a
non-partisan gathering we may be sure it
will prove a stimulus to Republicanism
and c to Democracy of the Douglas type,
but very depressing to the Bryanites who
may happen to attend it.
* One of the notable features of the cam
paign is the wide difference between the
'tjro parties in respect to able orators. On
the Republican side there are now in the
field, in addition to McKinley, ex-Presi-
dent Harrison, Senators Sherman, Alli
son and, Foraker, Thurston, Tom Reed,
Chauncey Depew, Carl Schurz and Bourke
Cockran, while on the Democratic side
there are only Bryan and Teller,
AN IMPORTANT MEETING.
A meeting of the Republican State Ex
ecutive Committee has been called by
Chairman Mclaughlin for to-day to con
sider the local political situation and to
devise ways and means for the promotion
of harmony and the awUMBOt of success
to the Republican ticket in San Francisco.
This will be a most important meeting
and the members of the committee who
are present thereat should so consider it
and should deal calmly and impartially
with the questions which will arise. The
thought which should dominate tbe dis
cussion and control the conclusions of the
committee should of course be how to
best assist and insure local Republican
succest. Any plan or proposition which
would further bemuddle and confuse the
existing condition of affairs should be
avoided by the committee no matter by
whom proposed.
The powers of the State Executive Com
mittee will doubtless be the subject of
some discussion. It goes without saying
tbat in matters whicii immediately and
directly affect the State or National ticket
this committee has practically the entire
powers of the party organization in its
hands. But in matters which are purely
local, and which only by reflection seem
to impede the succoss of the State or Na
tional ticket.it is a grave question of doubt
as to how far the power ana duty of the
committee' extend. Would it, for ex
ample, reach out a long arm Into Siskiyou
or San Diego counties to harmonize local
factions fighting over petty offices simply
because their conflict might by indirection
affect the vote upon the National ticket?
It would hardly undertake to do so; or, if
it did it would probably and very properly
limit its action to the giving of strong and
good advice to the contestants.
The fact that the State Executive
Committee meets aud has its head
quarters in San Francisco is a purely
fortuitous circumstance, and it would
seem that the same reasoning which
applies to the local discords of tbe moat
distant county applies equally to this City.
Besides, it is not at all certain that a fac
tional conflict confined to purely local dol
itics would affect seriously or injuri
ously the National ticket. Both elements
are for Meivinley, and both are arduously
laboring to insure the electoral vote of
California for him. Under the Australian
ballot system the loyalty of the voter for
the head of the ticket is influenced very
little, if as all, by his bias toward the
minor candidates near its foot. In addi
tion to this the existence of a local fight
always assures a large vote for the party,
because of t;:e effort of each element to
get its every adherent to the polls. These
practical facts Bhould be carefully weighed
by the committee in its deliberations to
day.
There is another consideration which
should receive the most careful and im
partial attention. The State Executive
Committee is a part of the regnlar Re
publican party organization of California.
Its members are men of large experience
in both local and State politics, and they
and each of them will therefore appre
ciate the prime importance of maintaining
and encouraging regularity in the party
organization as aa indispensable requisite
to party perpetuity as well as success.
Of the two local elements, one represents
regularity, tbe other does not; one sup
ports and is supported by a regular county
committee, the legal and rightful heir of
tbat local party organization; the other is
the heir of nothing, has no history and
can show no better motive for its
existence than the desire of a few
men to break down the local party and
upon its ruins rise to power. The members
of tbe State Executive Committee should
most carefully consider both before and at
their meeting to-day whether they ought
to do otherwise than sustain and support
the regular Republican party of Ban Fran
cisco in its effort to maintain tbe integrity
of the local parly organization, and in its
action take in the nomination of a com
plete local ticket in the Auditorium con
vention.
It is well to reflect whether a hasty
or intemperate exercise of power by
the State Committee might not induce
more discord and contusion into San Fran
cisco politics than at present exists, and
thereby yet more seriously endanger the
success of the National ticket.
No party ever went out of power which left
so magnificent a record as the Republican
party. Our great war debt, more than two
thirds of it paid off; our currency unques
tioned, our credit untarnished, the honor of
the Union unsullied; (hr country, in its ma
terial conditions, stronger thnn it had ever
bten before; the workingmen better employed
and better paid than ever, before, with pros
perity in every part of the Bepublic, and in
no part an idle workingman who wanted
work. âHcKinley.
THE DIVIDED DEMOCRACY.
The condition of the Democratic party
in the City of San Francisco is deplorable.
No patriotic follower of the faith of De
mocracy, and there are thousands of such,
can view the situation without deep re
gret tbat bis party has. fallen into the
hands of corrupt machine politicians.
Democracy in this City is torn and rent
asunder, but each of the warring factionsâ
the Junta and the old line Democratsâ is
under the absolute domination and iron
control of two of the most notorious
bosses that ever disgraced the history or
debauched the politics of San Francisco.
On one hand tne Democratic Moses is
Sam Rainey, tee notorious manipulator of
the Fire Department and one time doer of
dirty work for Buckley, the "blind dtvil"
of the Bourbons. Opposed to this immac
ulate politician, from whom lovers of pure
politics turn in disgust, is the notorious
Chris Buckley himself, whose career in
local politics once made this City noted
the world over as the perfect type of polit
ical degeneration, a man who bad to flee
the City to evade the avenging wrath of
the people as expressed by their Grand
Jury.
It is a significant sign and indicative of
its lack of political integrity tbat the Ex
aminer is silent as to the character of the
two worthies who are now in charge of
local Democratic politics. Bui a few
months ago the Examiner was declaring
that these men were unfit to be entrusted
with public affairs and it portrayed Buck
ley as a wretch fit only for the peni
tentiary, chronicling each day hi* flight
from the jurisdiction of the courts and
showing how he hid in Europe to outwit
the Sheriffs who had warrants for his ar
rest.
Though the Democracy is hopelessly
THE SAS FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 2S, 1896.
I divided the prospect of defeat has made
i its local organ desperate. It makes wild
| statements every day and does all in its
I power, which is little, to throw doubt and
! confusion iuto the minds of honest voters.
L Amid contending factions, ambitious
bosses, clashing clans and divided councils
the honest and patriotic Democrat, who,
like his Republican neighbor, desires pure
politics and economical local government,
; is asking where he will take his stand.
j * The logical place of such a citizen is
; witli the honest and untrammeled Colonel
Charles L. Taylor. He has been strongly
tried; his record is at* open book upon
j whose pages there is neither blot nor
stain; be represents freedom from boss
rule, decent and economical government.
It is pitiful to see tne Democratic organ
that a few months ago pretended to cham
pion the cause of the people thus give aid
and comfort to political highwaymen who
roam the City bent on mischief and pub
lic plunder. Thus divided aud torn within
Itfl own camp the Democratic orgau seeks
to cause confusion in the Republi
can ranks. To tbat end, reprehen
sible as it is and incredible aa it
| may seem, the Esttminer is seekins by
every art of misrepresentation to DUt
the City iv the grasp of a baud of corrupt
politicians as shameless as any tbat ever
infested San Francisco. The good people
of this City will uot be deceived. They
will entrust the mayoralty to tried and
trne Colonel Taylor. They will not suffer
their affairs to be turned over to either of
the political worthies, Kainey and Buck-
MOST EXCELLENT ADVICE.
John W. Mitchell of Los Angeles de
livered himself of a speech before a gath
ering of Populists and Democrats at Met
ropolitan Hall in this city last Saturday
nigbt, and he is deserving of the thanks
of all who think the honor and integrity
of the Nation should be maintained for so
delivering himself.
If there was any doubt in the minds of
the people as to what would become of the
country if Bryanism should prevail, there
is no room for any now. Mr. Mitchell
was frank enough and honest enough to
point out the dangers to our system of
povernraent that would follow Bryan's
election, but he did not know he was call
ing attention to them.
Mr. Mitchell said "there are crucial tests
to which the principles of parties shoula
be subjected. The platform should be
carefully examined for the principles con
tained therein and the past history of the
party taken into consideration."
Just to spare the feelings of Mr. Mitch
ell and his fellow Democrats the past
history of his party will be left undis
turbed. To Btir itnp would be to force un
: comfortable recollections upon the mind.
j There were events leading up to and fol
! lowing l^iJl which might better be left as
j though forjrotten, and there have been
I events in the business worid during the
last three yearÃ which are painful subjects
for the Democracy to discuss. Out of re
srject for tiie feelingÃ of Mr. Mitchell and
his Democratic -riends no attempt will l*e
made to consider the past History of his
party, notwithstanding he invites it. Bat
we will take him at his word and examine
the principles contained in his Chicago
platform. ,
The platform whose principles Mr. Mitch
ell so warmly and enthusiastically com
mends to the i-eopleof California demands
that the Government give up the un-Dem
ocratic civil-service notion and return to
I the sDOils system. It is contrary to the
j principles of the party, the Chicago plat
| form declares, to cut the ward boss off from
| opportunity to plunder the public. Mr.
â  Bryan is very outspoken in his denuncia
j tion of whatever is calculated to prevent
i the payment of campaign debts in fat
j oitices. That is a principle of the Chicago
j platform which, as Mr. Mitchell suggests,
might be carefully examined by the people
to their protit.
Upon examination, and a not very crit
| ical examination at that, the Chicago plat
form will reveal a positive declaration that
if Mr. Bryan is electedtlie Supreme Court
! of the Nation will be legislated into a court
i that shall interpret the constitution and
the laws in the light of the principles of
the Bryan- Alteeld-Tillman political firm.
jit la to be hoped tbat Mr. Mitchell will
continue to urge the people to examine t lie
I principles of the party's platform.
The same platform calls fora still nearer
approach to free trade, and workingmen
who are out of employment because of the
operation of the Wilson-Gorman tariff act,
as well as owners of industries that are
standing idle from the same canse, should
look into ttiat particular principle of Mr.
Mitchell's nlatform. If Mr. M itctiell would
furnish American workingmen with the
wage schedules of foreign industries they
would find it much easier to figure out the
wages they might expect if Mr. Bryan is
elected. *
Now tbat Mr. Mitchell baa suggested that
the platform of his party should be care
fully examined, and the suggestion i.< a
good one, it is to be hoped that its princi
ples will be thoroughly analyzed, especially
by those who do not want to live tinder a
ward- bo.<H system of Government ; by those
who do not like the idea of converting the
Supreme bench into a court that would
substitute the Chicago platform for the
constitution of the Nation, and by those
who dislike the idea of obliging our work
ing people- to compete single-handed with
the pauper labor of other countries.
One thing above all else- that is wanted at
this juncture is the return of public and pri
vate confidence. Its absence is our funda
mental trouble. It has been aggravated by a
variety of cmues, but nono greater than the
assault which has been made by the allied
political organisations upon the credit and
the currency of the country. â McKinley.
RIGHTS OF EMPLOYER AND EM
PLOYE.
\
Bryan newspapers and speakers are try
ing very hard to make it appear that when
a railway official or manager of an in
dustrial enterprise advises with his em
ployes concerning the issues of the Presi
dential campaign he is coercing them into
declaring for Major McKlnley. If these
charges can be substantiated it is the duty
of the Bryanites to submit the proofs; but
if they cannot and have no reason for
making them other than a desire to in
fluence public ooinion against railway
corporations and industrial companies tor
purely political advantage they are rank
enemies of the country. The candidate
who would himself or permit others to
purposely make wrong statements con
cerning the relation existing between thosj
who sell tbeir labor and those who buy it,
for the purpose ol gaining political ad
vantage, is not only a traitor to his coun
try, but he is a sneaking coward.
More thau 24,000,000 of the inhabitants
of the United States are in business, either
as employers or employes, ana nearly, if
not quite, 14,000,000 of them are legal
voters; moreover, gainful occupation is
necessary to every one of them. There is
scarcely a line of business known fo com
merce that is aot represented in our traae
and traffic operations, and bo intimately
connected are they that not one of them
could be Injured without the shock being
felt Id the homes of every one of the 24,
-000.0C0. Therefore, the man who willfully
cripples the efficiency of any one line of
occupation is not only a destroyer of
homes, but he is an assassin of whole com
munities, and a more dangerous enemy of
mankind than pestilence or famine.
No wrong is done, no line of trade iB in
jured when the employer of men tells them
what the effect the election of this or that
man wonld have upon his business enter
prise, bat tue employer only does his duty
to his employes when he tells them what
they may expect under given circum
stances. It is the rigbt of employes to
know as far ir. advance as possible what
influence certain possible contingencies
are likely to, exert upon their opportunity
to earn wages, and it is equally incumbent
upon employes to acquaint their employer
with what their action would be under
given conditions, but while holding it to
be the right but not the duty of employes
to gire notice of tneir purpose, the Bryan
ites deny that the employer has any such
right, and they also deny his right to
refuse to make, his plans aud operations
conform to any new conditions that may
be thrust upon him.
Uryan says it means coercion when an
employer of men says the free and unlim
ited coinage of silver independent of the
will and Rood of the nations he has busi
ness relations with would bo circumacribe
his market that he would have to reduce
his output and consequently would require
fewer operators, but common justice saya
it would be an act of kindness, and bia
duty as well, to give bis employes notice
of what certain contingencies would have
in store for them.
It is the privilege of employes to do as
they please. They may vote for a policy
that would deprive their employer of suffi
cient opportunity to sell his product to
keep them employed, or they may vote to
sustain him. It is their right to do either.
The presumption is that every sensible
man would vote for a policy that was cal
culated to insure him continuous employ
ment at good wages, but be does not have
to, nor doe* his employer have to supply
bim with work if a policy bas been adopted
that destroys his ability to give him work.
Labor is indispensable to the creation and
profitable use of capital, and capital increases
the efficiency and value of labor. Whoever
arrays the one against the other is an enemy
of both. That policy is wisest and best which
harmonizes the two on the basis of absolute
justice. â McKinley.
NOTHING TO EAT.
It was fortunate for Solomon tbat he
lived in an age when he could say, "A
man hath no better thing undijr the gun
than to eat, and to arink, and to be
merry." Had he lived in this age of med
dlesome scientists there is no telling what
would have become of his appetite for
good things. A school of science in Penn
sylvania, an annex of the Western Uni
versity of that State, gravely announces
that one should not drink "city water,"
because it swarms with disease microbes;
and as for country water, why, "the moss
covered bucket"' is where they come into
life and lay plans to spread typhoid and
other fevers through the water reservoirs
of the towns. Ice put in water is the dis
ease germ's delight. He multiplies by the
million in ice water.
These scientists, one would think, would
suggest wine as a substitute for water, but
they do nothing of the kind. They say
neurly all wine is doctored and burns out
the lining of the stomach, and that the
same is true of whisky and beer, although
they admit that a good, pure article of
wine, beer and whisky is not vÂ«ry nslcy.
They admit that some may find joy in a
dead drunk that is superinduced by doc
tored liquors, but that the joy obtained
from a life of soberness is better.
But these wise men do not stop at
drinks. They say tomatoes, raworcooked,
are the undertakers' delight; potatoes are
poisonous and indigestible; cabbage is
another name for cholera, and lettuce is
of the same family; beans are very bad
for the stomach ; turnips are no better
than sawdust. One might as well take
rough-on-rats as to eat onions or cucum
bers. White bread is dreadfully bad for the
stomach, and corn bread is too "forceful"
for the inside cl a man, while buckwheat
cake-, flannel-cakes and all such things
are regular grave-openers. Cherries,
grapes ana watermelons are angels' of
death in disguise.
As for meat all kinds are unwholesome;
besides, it is wicked to take life to satisfy
our appetites, and retribution will surely
overtake all who slay and fat. The frying
pan, these scientists say, is au enemy of
civilization, and they say very many other
things, too, but since it is death to eat
meat or vegetables, there does not ap
pear to be much use for cooking utensils.
It must be that these Pennsylvania wise
men are about to patent a new kind of
food, or that they arrived at their conclu
sions after attending a banquet.
COAST EXCHANGES,
The Calaveros Prospect has taken a big step
in the way of improvement, and may now lay
claim to being one of the handsomest among

"Farewell, vain world I" is the parting utter
ance of the Arbuckle Transcript, the editors of
which were last week forced to surrender to
cruel fate and a type foundry creditor. Messrs.
J. L. Kennon and L. A. Eicaler, after seven
months of trial in the journalistic field of
Colusa County, have quitted the unequal
struggle, as they say, "with all grace." The
Transcript was an Â«*lndependent" paper.
Especially during such a political campaign
as this, the people have little use for a paper
which has no fixed opinions on issues that
affect every nook and corner of the whole
country. The Transcript might have done
very well had it considered carefully the fact
thÂ»t It was dependent for Its support and
maintenance upon people who are dependent
for their prosperity upon protection to their
home industries and labor.
The Boulder Blast will be fired no more, at
least by Its late manager, J. R. Watson, who,
with expressions of regret, has departed for
the East. Mr, Watson was evidently a right
minded man, as these words of bis with
reference to the Blast would indicate: "We
would like to have it live, but we do not want
it to live to do harm. We have tried to hold
it free from that which is harmful and have
refused revenue that might come from ad
vertising that which we considered wrong."

evidence of oil, but in this region the oil is
evident itself. It can be found in many places
floating on the water or exuding from the
sand rock, or percolating through the mud,
coming up with the spring water. Magnificent
oil discoveries have been made in countries
where there are not as good indications as
there are here."
The Herald sensibly suggests the organiza
tion of a joint stock company among Liver
more citizens to sink an experimental well,
ana concludes;
"This is a matter of great Importance. It
should be agitated and investigated with
vigor. Every interest, industrial aud prop
erty, is at stake. There ia everything to gain
and barely nothing to lose in pushing the ex
ploration. Our community and valley must
build up by its own energy. Outside wealth
and capital will come to us when we attract it
by our own progressive efforts. We are losing
too much time waiting for something to

Promotion in the British navy is entirely by
selection, and twice a year the list is carefully
scanned by the service to ascertain who were
the lucky ones. Lust July five officers were ad
vanced to the rank of captain, 17 to command

commanders is 40 and another only 33 years
of age. Iv the United Slates navy promotion
is only by seniority, by which many excellent
officers remain stationary in out* grade for
many years. The youngest officers iv the sev

are: Kear -admiral. 60; commodore, 57;
captain, 50; commander, 4.H; lieutenant

largest number of guns of any vessel afloat,
the main battery consisting of four 9.4-inch
b. 1. r., eiÃhteen 5.9-inch quick-firing guns,
and a secondary battery of twelve 3.3 inch,
twenty-four 1.9 iuch a"nd twelve machine

and with one s-crew, ten knots an hour. The
armor-belt is 11% inches and the barrjettes

Blunders in French naval vessels are becom
ing altogether too numerous ot late years, and
a large portion of ships constructed within the
past ten years will either prove entirely use

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
H. J. Lutcher of Galveston, Texas, the
largest lumber and mill man of the South, ar
rived at the Palace Hotel yesterday with his
wife, after a three months' recreation trip
through the middle western and northwesters
States. He was the first big lumber dealer to
leave the forests of Michigan and Minnesota
for those of the Southern States, which he
considers the more promising field. He owns
750,000 acres of forest land and has two large
mills in operation. One is near Orange and
in the present dull times gives employment to
300 men. The other, a new plant on the
Mississippi between New Orleans and Baton
Rouge, includes a sash, door and blind factory,
one of the largest in America, aad gives em
ployment to 500 men. It tuans out 1000 doors,
1000 sashes and 1000 blinds a day, an outfit
equaled by no other factory in this country
except that possibly of Palmer d Fuller of
Chicago. To the completion and perfection of
this new factory with its diversified machin
ery, Mr. Lutcher gave his entire attention for
three months, with tbe result that he is now
taklxrg a much-needed rest. He will spend
over a month in California and will then take
his wile for a visit to tbe City of Mexico. He
was there years ago, having supplied all the
lumber needed in the construction of the rail
road from Â£1 Paso, Texas, to the capital of
Mexico. He also furnished C. P. Huntington
with three-fourths of all the railroad ties used
in the construction of the Southern Pacific
road. .

THE "EXAMINER'S" SILVER MINES.
San Francisco News Letter.
Thb Call has dealt the Examiner some
weighty blows during the week. Hereafter
nobody can have a doubt that neither the Ban
Francisco Examiner nor the New York Jour
nal is worth reading on the subject of coin
age. The interest of their proprietor, W. R.
Hearst.isso largely made up of silver mines
that he could easily afford to buy two or three
morÂ« "great dailies 11 and run then? for noth
ing, if only Bryan and a silver Congress be
elected. Of course he would not think of run
ning them at that price, but he could if Ho
wished. He is not, however, that kind of a
man. There iÂ«, notwithstanding "his streat
wealth, not a more uiinbie, or unprincipled
catcher of aiekelÃ in all this land. His nu
merous devices, often made up of hatred and
falsehood, to conjure Kmaii coins'uut of the
pockets of his readers iuto his own, have about
sickened all the better elements of our. local
society.
For so young a man, raised with the dowble
advantage of money and education, ,hjs greed
and low morals ore phenomenal. .The Call.
has gone to first hand lor its information as
to his interest in silver mines. It. published
the sworn Inventory filed in court of the
Hoarst estate, from which it appears that the
estate consists of mining interests to the vania
of $8,750,000. Fuur large and valuable sliver
mines make a considerable figure in tiTe list. .
One of them is baid to be easily worth $7,000,
-000. If the silver-mine owners are te, have â 
their product nearly doubled in valueâ and
that is the sole aim of the Bryan campaignâ it
is very palpable wny Mr. Hearst became such
an enterprising advocate of silver, as soon as
he thought there was a chance of making such.
advocacy a success. He did mrt always appear
to be for silver, but that was when he thought
It would kill his papers if he permitted them .
to say what lie thought. Hence, it came" that
his writers were permitted to go as' far as thejr
li^eri for gold, and Tup. Call furnishes-curioos
reading in showinc; nuw far that was. .'.* â¢ : â 
It was not until after Bryan's nomination
that he dared to change the coarse of his New-
York Journal, which previously had as good
editorials as he can procnr â which is not say
ing muchâ in favor of the gold standard. Up
to then he lived in fe*r and tremtjllng as
to the possible !oÂ«s of the nickels oi the
proletariat if he abandoned the advocacy ol
honest money. Bui Bryan's speech, nomina
tion and temporary popularity gave Hearst
the opportunity tie wanted, and he promptly â¢
switched around to what, in point of fact, ia
nothing more nor leas than booming' bis own
silver interests. Tbat may be worldly wis
dom, bnt it is downright disgraceful journal
ism, which no honest man respects. But,
really, does Mr. Hearst care for the respept of
honest men? Since his exposure in the rail- .
road blackmailing case there are not'xnany
men who believe he does. His course since
then has been such that the general belief is
that he will have blood or die in tbe attempt.
His brief career furnishes "a curious object
lesson. He is a conspicuous example of the -
danger inherited wealth is to a young man ap
parently without scruples or nonor.
CONSISTENCY NOT EXPECTED.
Alarueda Argus.
The Call Is trying to prove the Examiner to
be inconsistent on the silver question by pub
lishing some of its editorials of the past. Not
necessary. Nobody expects it to be consistent,
even 1n one issue. Nobody expects it even to
be fair or decent. Nobody cares what its
policy or politics is. Who thinks of arraign
ing the pink papers of the barber-shops for
their lack of consistency or their flip-flopping
on questions of public interest? Who lookÃ to
them for lessons in, or examples of, or incite
ments to morality? Why The Call should at
tempt such an unnecessary and undemanded
service we are unable to see.

The Four Episcopal Church Bishops "Who Preached Yesterday.
Bishop Kendrick at the Ch urrh of tli
Advent, Bishop Johnson at Trinity and
Bishop Leonard at Grace.
Bishop Leonard spoke on the text from
Ephesians vi:l0 â "Finally, my brethren,
be strong in the Lord. " He said:
"The age and country in which we live
make much of the practical. It is a char
acteristic much admired and one which
contributes largely to success. The end of
life with most men is to succeed in that
which they undertake, and it is certaiuly
a laudable desire. No doubt the reason
why there is such admiration of successfal
men is because they are so few.
"Fame, wealth and high mental achieve
ments come to few. Mediocrity is the
distinguishing mark cf the larger num
ber, while for the vast majority of men
there seems to be nothing but bare exist
ence and little to relieve the dull monotony
of commonplace lives.
"There is a word about which much
needs to be saidâ it is moral courage.
Stand up for that which is right. How
comes it that men have so little to say
about this kind of strength?
"We are regretting all the while that
there is in our society a low moral tone.
We are all striving, I hope, each in his
own way, to abate this tone. Our public
school B.vstem of education is doing all
that is possible in this direction, and there
are many other agencies working upon
the same lines."
Bishop Leonard spoke atrongly against
divorce. He said he had read that in
proportion to thÂ« number of marriages
more divorces were granted in Ban Ffan
cisco than any place in the world.
Bishop Kendnck delivered a sermon at
the Church of the Advent He took for
his text the following: "I must work the
works of Him that sent me while it is day ;
the night cometh when no man can
work." (Br. John, ix:4.)
"The law of opportunities is that there
is a tit time for doing things, and if they
are not done then they cannot be done at
ail," said he.
"There are some opportunities that con
sist of a single event. There comes a
time when something must instantly be
done.

In many a great battle there was a su
preme moment when everything de
pended on doing the right thing. The
smoke lifted and then was the opportun
ity. Then or never the victory must be
won. And in tha battle of life many a
man can trace his success or failure to an
opportunity that came to him once and
that never came to him again, and he
used it or failed to use It.
"There is an important sense in which
every day is an opportunity on whicu the
sun goes down :iot to rise again. The
work that we do not do in a day can never
be done. We cannot put it off till to-mor
row, for to-morrow will have its own work.
If we do to-day's work to-morrow, when
shall we- do to-morrow's work? Or, if we
can do two days' work in one, how long
can we keep that up?"
Bishop Barker delivered a sermon at St.
John's. His subject was "The Law of
Growth."
"The most interesting illustrations of
the law are found In a brief consideration
of the physical Bide of human life," said
he. "The body is endowed with faculties,
taUnts, powers and sights. Tbe law runs
underneath each faculty. The mind ex
pands by education. As a nation we
spend millions of money in building
schools, and this illustrates the applica
tion of the law."
The Bishop described a lecture of Tyn
dall's in Philadelphia on light and in a
few words drew tbe parallel lesson for the
church. As the various gas jets leaped
into prominence when different tuning
forks were sounded so must the church,
through its members, ever proclaim her
truths until th* individual eoul quivers
and responds. He close! with the simple

statement that "in view of the wonderful
Jaw of progress by education and exercise
I consider religion a common-sense
thing."
Bishop Johnson chose as a subject St.
Luke ii : 48, 47. He said :
''The most casual observer must see
that we are actually in the flood of a can^e
of movements which are calling for read
justment in the social and political world.
"What man for centuries did with his
body he now does with his brain. Men
who work Are in a chaotic state because of
the conditions under wh^ch they serve.
The skilled artisan mint use new tools,
tools quite, different from those with which
he plied his traae. The great horde of
mechanics has been locked out of work by
the mind of man. Labor is thus forced to
fields of new and untried effort, or else it
forced to jsive up the struggle for exist
ence.
"This again accounts to a certain extent
for a new feature in our modern life,
namely: Woman in the shops and offices,
forced there by the necessities which an
unemployed father or brother has created.
Here then are the causes that make our
times transitional. The rich and the
poor are restless because they are seeking
their new place in the readjustment of
things."

A FORGER WITH A RECORD
W. Brcwn, Wanted in Fort
Worth, Tex , Was a Famous
Rustler.
He Took an Active Part in a Three
Days' Fight W;th Cattlemen
Over Four Years Ago.
There is a hitch in the papers brought
here by Chief Maddox of Fort Worth,
Tex., for tbe eatraditiou of W. Brown,
alias W. J. Aah, alias A. W. Maun, who is
wanted there and in other places for
forgery and obtaining goods by false pre
tenses, as stated in yesterday's Call.
Brown registered at the Palace Hotel r.s
W. C. Wallace, and his partner, J. T. Mc-
Kay, at the Occidental Hotel as J. F.
Camden. While on the way here each
bad posted a letter to himself at a way
station, and the letters arrived at the
Palace and Occidental the day after they
registered. They took the precaution to
open the letters in presence of the clerks,
and each carelessly allowed a draft in
closed to lie on the desk so that the clerks
could see it. Camden's draft was for
?3500 and Wallace's for $500. The result
was they were not pressed for payment of
their Dills.
McKay, or Camden as he called him
self, got suspicious and fled to Kansas
City, where he was arrested. Brown was
arrested at the Palace Hotel by Detectives
Seymour and Whitater on September 19.
When searched a heavy revolver with five
notches in it was found in his pocket, and
there is a history attached to it.
Brown is a cowboy, or, more correctly
speaking, a rustler, "in the beginning of
1892 there was serious trouble between the
rustlers and the regular cattlemen in
Texas and it ultimately ended in open
warfare. The rustlers were led by three
brothers, Nick, Jack and Jim Ray, and
Brown was one of their lieutenants.
The cattlemen and their cowboys were,
on April 9, surrounded by the rustlers at
Buffalo, Wyo., where the former could
neither get food nor water. Tuey fought
for three days and then the cattlemen
were reacueu oy a colored troop of United
States cavalry. Nearly a hundred of the
cattkmen and their cowboys were killed
and the rustlers had also several killed,
union ir them two of the leaders, Nick and
Jack Ray. Nick Ray before he bit the
dust killed five of the enemy and his sur
viving brother, Jim, made the tive notches
in the weapon that did the killing to show
his dead brother's prowess. He presented
the revolver to Brown, who has carried it
in his belt ever since. It is a 45-cahber,
hair trigger and shoots a Winchester bui
le\
Brown, in speaking of the fight yester
day, was very modest and would not say
how many, if any, cattlemen fell victims
to his weapon.

HOLIDAY FOR THE
HEBREW ORPHANS
Twenty-Fifth Anniversary
of the Society Cele
brated.
GREAT JEWISH CHARITY
What Has Besn ' Accomplished
in a Quarter of a Cen
tury.
TOLD BY PRESIDENT LEVY.
The Children Entertain Visitors to
the Asylum With an Operetta
and Music.
The twenty-fifth anniversary yf the
founding of the Pacific Hebrew Orphan
Asylum and Home Society occurred yes
terday, and it was made the occasion of a
celebration well worthy of the event.
There was a large gathering of Jewish peo
ple at the asylum at Devisadero and Hayes
streets, and the visitors were received by
President S. W. Levy, Superintendent
Henry Mauser and other officers of the in
stitution. In the afternoon, after a recep
tion in the asylum building, an entertain
ment that proved to be a very enjoyable
affair was given in the amusement hall by
the children, immediately after the an
nual meeting of the members of the so
ciety.
President Levy called the meeting to
order after the Anspacber band, composed
of Hebrew orphans, had played a quite
brilliant overture. Mr. Levy read his re
port, which was comprehensive and inter
esting to all present.
"The credit should be given the B'nai
B'ritb Society for having originated the
idea of founding and establishing an or
phans' home in this City," he said, "but
that society did not have the means to
carry out the scheme alone and it was left
for this association to materialize what
was before a mere inspiration. It was on
the 25th day of July, 1871, that this asso
ciation was formed â to quote the language
of our act of incorporation â 'ior the care,
relief, protection and improvement of or
phan children, and for the care of aged
Israelites, who are without adequate
means of support.'
Continuing, he said: "When we take a
retrospective glance into the past and
think of the modest quarters which we
occupiod in tbe rented ouiJding on Mason
street from 1872 to 1876, and which did
such good service for the first years of our
society's existence, and remember how
proud we were of it, thinking that we had
reached a point beyond which it was im
possible to go, and compare it with our
present two great institutions, with their
imposing buildings, their large grounds,
attractive surroundings, elegantly ap
pointed gymnasium and extensive work
shops connected with our orphan asylum
building, we feel that our success has been
remarkable. And when we take into fur
ther consideration the fact that in 1891.we
carried out the second great object of our
corporation, viz., the establishment and
! erection of our home for the aged, which
' is complete in every detail, and that every
I dollar due for the purchase of the land
and (he erection of both the asylum and
home building has been paid, we can
truly say that we have, under a kind
providence, accomplished marvelous re
sults."
Still there was considerable work before j
the society, for the recent extensive im
provements have so depleted the treasury
that ways and means for maintenance of I
both institutions must be adopted. As
much as $51,389 S3 was paid out on build
ing contracts during the past year, and as
this created a deficiency, Mr. LiÂ«vy sug
gested that a committee be appointed to
solicit subscriptions. As it was twenty
years since the society made its last ap
; peal to the public he believed that the
j society could very properly make another
call for aid.
"Should we endeavor to retrench in any
way," he said, " we should have to do so
at the expense of seriously crippling one
or both institutions, and we would be sub
jected to the humiliation of refusing fur
ther applications for admission. We are
now conducting both institutions with the
greatest amount of liberality and at the
same time with the least amount of ex
penditure."
The Income of the society during the
year was $25,550 76 from all'souices, and
expenses, including alterations and erec
tion of a workshop building, $26,500 22 for
the asylum and $10,929 63 for the home.
The total expense was $37,429 85. The es
timated amount necessary for the next
year was given at $27,500 for the asylum
and $11,000 for the home, but from past
experience it was calculated that without
some extraordinary assistance the loss
would be about $12,949. To ward off such
a possibility the board of trustees has de
termined to use every endeavor to increase
the membership roll. During the year
donations and requests received amounted
to $10,656 77.
Regarding membership Mr. Levy an
nounced that a year ago there were 2037,
and since then 23 were lost by death, 80
by resignation and 7 were stricken from
the roll. One life member and 47 con
tributing members were admitted, mak
ing the total 1969â loss of 06 members.
There were 122 children in the asylum
at the last annual meeting. Since then 30
have been admitted and 18 discharged,
leaving 67 boys and 67 girls in the institu
tion, 6 of whom are living with respect
able families and learning trades. The
children have attended the public schools,
and have been instructed by special teach*
era in the asylum. Youthful mechanics
in the various workshops are becoming
experts at tneir trades under the direction
of Superintendent Mauser, and boys with
musical talent are instructed by Professor
L. yon der Mehden in music as members
of the Anspacher band. At tha home
there were 18 men and â 10 women a year
since, 3 men and 2 women have been ad
mitted, and 5 men died, leaving 16 men
and 12 women in the institution.
The report concluded with thanks to
various benefactors of both institutions.
The report was greeted with cordial ap
plause and by vote accepted and ordered
to be printer.
Reading of other reports, such as those
of the secretary and superintendent, was
dispensed with, as they were embodied in
the president's report.
J. Greeuebaum moved that the presi
dent and .vice-president be given a vote
of thanks from the society for their
work during the past year. He took the
chair temporarily and everybody, "it
seemed, said aye I . -
The president was empowered to ap
point a committee on the election of di
rectors, whose terms have expired.
An operetta in three act.*, entitled, "The
Four-leaved Clover, or the Charm," was
effectively presented by the children with
the following cast:
Isabella, Countess of Aguilar, Hulda La
komy; Lady Inea, Hannah Rosen thai; Lady
Hindu. Bub. Lakomy ; Susanna, maid to Lady
Inez, Jennie Levy; Don Sebastian, Com. of the
Castle, Philip Sapiro; Don Carlos, a Spanish
guest, EtUe Reuben; Sir Roland Graeme, an
English guest, Aaron Sapiro; Pedro and Don
ald, their servants, Aaron Oppenhelmer and
Bau Oppenheimer; Lorenzo, seneschal, Hoary
Goldstein ; Gluck-Auf, a German sprite, Jennie
Unger; Gretcteu, his sister and Interpreter,
Amelia Snoek; Mazett, leader of gypsies, Leo
Schoenfeld; Fedalmn., a gypsy fortune-teller,
Jeunie Anshel; lords, ladies, gypsies, chil
dren, athie;es, etc.
Between the first and second acts a
piano duet was given by Amelia Snoek
and Hulda Lakomy. The entertainment
was under the direction of Superintend
ent Henry Mauser, assisted by Mrs. H.
Mauser. Miss E. M. Kropp, Miss Jeanette
Ephraira, William Lis*ner, Miss Adeie
Levy and Professor yon der Mehden, and
Messrs. Friedlander and Gottlob of the
Columbia Theater added much to the gen
eral effect with scenery and the assistance
of the stage staff.
Prizes were awarded as follows by the
president to the orphan children:

THOUSANDS WATCH THE FEAT.
Said to Bj the First Time That the
Historic Cliff-House Rookery
Was Circled.
Fully 10,000 people were witnesses yes
terday of the wonderful surf-swimming
feat by CharJes Cavill of rounding one of
the Seal Rocks. This is said to be the first
time the feat has been accomplished,
though several times attempted.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the man
who the Sunday previous swam across the
Golden Gate was presented to the specta
tors in Sutro Baths and seven minutes
after was on the beach northeast of the
south seal rock. He was followed by every
person In the baths who filled every point
of vantage from which they could see the
daring swimmer enter the water.
In a moment after reaching the beach
he at once plunged into the surf, passing
gracefully and easily through two immense
breakers, and then with that wonderful
stroke that marks his swimming he struck
out for the seal rock. As.he approached it
there was seen in the vicinity of the home
of the seals a boat manned by a crew of the
Dolphin Club and another manned by a
crew from the United States Life Saving
Station south of the Cliff House.
These men in boats were in tho vicinity
to lender assistance to the swimmer
should he need it. Not only was Cavill
seen by those who were near the starting
point, but by crowds who thronged the
balconies of the Cliff House and thousands
who were on the beach between the Cliff
House and the Olympic pier.
Stroke by stroke the intrepid swimmer
advanced. Then it was seen than an ex
traordinary sensation was being created
among the biz ampnibians on tbe rocky
bluff ahead. When Cavill was abreast of
their rock seal after seal leaped from the
Bides into tbe water and in procession
headed for tbe man who had dared to in
vade their preserves. One of the animals
came within ten feet of the swimmer, but
with a knife which he had in a sheath
strapped to his body, and which he drew,
he made a lunge at tho approaching
animal, which, with the rest, turned and
swam for the rock again. Cavill made the
tern, the boats keeping close to him, and
when ne was within a hundred yards of
the beach where he was to land he was
met by Adolph Kahn, who swam in with
him and came in a good second. The dis
tance was about one mrle and the time
consumed in the trip twenty-four minutes.
As Cavill landed he was greeted with
loud cheers, and when he returned to the
baths he was there loudly applauded by
the immense crowd that awaited' him. He
stated that the swim was a very cold one.
After resting a few minutes Cavill gave an
exhibition of fancy swimming and trick
divins.
During the afternoon in the baths Cor
nell and Enepy gave a burlesque boxing
match which was very amusing and they
also gave burlesque diving and swimming.

Ing, there was a resolution adopted denying the
charge that money received rom members had

that the i uaiÂ«es emanated from certain parties
with a grievance, ana that ihe charges had no
exigence in fact. It was also stated that the
money received by Mr. Brooks was not for incor
poration but for books and supplies.
Not to Walk In.
An American in England, who had
bought a pair of shoes of a fashionable
dealer, carried them back soon with a
protest.
"Look herei" he said, "I've had these
shoes only two weeks and they are com
pletely out of shape and the leather ia
giving away in two places."
Tne Englishman looked at the shoes an
instant. "Dear me! dear me!" he said.
"You have been walking in those shoes?
That's it, sir! Our shoes are made only
for carriage people, hir!"
And the dealer loftily bowed the Ameri
can out or the shop.â Canadian Shoe and

RYAN DISCOURSES
ON ROMANISM
Declares He Has Always
Believed in Religious
Liberty.
CHURCH AND NATION.
Talks of "Romanized Protestant
ism" and Asks "What Shall
Be the Remedy?"
QUITZaWS CAUTIOUS REMARKS.
Not Ready to Announce the Policy of
the American Protective
Association.
Chairman Qnltzow, in his opening re
marks before tue Good Citizenship meeting,
held at Metropolitan Temple yesterday
afternoon, said that in due time the polit
ical policy of the American Protective
Association would be announced. There
was no need to hurry, he said, because
when the policy was finally defined it
would be so emphatic as to at once attract
the attention of all good citizens.
"A Romanized Protestantismâ What
Shall Be the Remedy?" was the subject
selected by Major T. C. Ryan, the regular
speaker for the occasion. He prefaced his
remarks by saying that he believed in per
fect religious liberty in whatever form it
might come, whether as Methodist, Bap
tist, Presbyterian or Catholic. Con
tinuing on this line, he said amon^: other
things:
Our original immigrants to this country
brought with them tne principles oi Protest
antism, mingled quite a little with the intol
erant principles of Romanism, and because of
the habits oi thought formed by them while
under the dominion oi Romanism they mani
fested to some extent iuioierance upon these
shores, but when the lest came they entered
heartily into the establishment of a govern
ment guaranteeing the highest civil and re
ligious liberty. They at once gave up their
intolerance in order to make sure the triumph
of Protestantism in its most comprehensive
sense.
Protestantism is not a religion that recog
nizes its own system of faith and excludes all
others. It is only a form of Christianity.
There is not a church in the world to-day that
has the right to say â¢â¢We are a Protestant
church," but raiher we are the fruits of Prot
estantis-m. In its proper signification Protest
antism embraces everything springing from
the Reformation â that is, ail principles, civil
and religious, have their buth in that great
movement.
Guizoisays: "The leading cause of tbe ne
formation was a sudden effort made by the
human mind to achieve its liberty; a great in
surrection oi human intelligence." It had to
contend against everything in church and
Slate that put a restraint on liberty. It saved
religion by separating it from the corruptions
of tne Papacy. Wherever and whenever free
thought, free speech and free pret-s auound it
is exclusively of Protestant origin. The de
struction of Protestantism means the destruc
tion of these rights.
I believe in the Son of God, and yet I believe
God has given me a modicum of common
sense and capability to understand some
things in the Holy Word, whose power and in
fluence Rome seeks to ucÂ»iroy. It is purely an
American Idea, emblazoned in the Declaration
of Independence, that "Government derives
its just powers from the consent of the gov
erned." And that, too, is the Bible doctrine,
couched in the s tatemen t "The powers that be
are ordained of Uod." This does not mean the
persons whom we place in power, but the
powers that are lodged in the person.
The patriotism of our fathers must not be
impugned by any class who are in the posseu
sion of a "zeal without knowledge, or who are
the slaves of mere sentlmentalism." These
God-inspired men when they were construct
ing our iorm of Government gave not only the
Deity himself, but the peopie, a home in their
hearts, and with tliese they commenced. See
their wisdom in drafting the constitution.
They framed it so that religion can never be
made a lest in the authority of the Govern
ment. No government can of any right as
sume any responsibility in matters of religion.
It is written "every knee shall bow to mo,"
"every tongue shall confess to God." Does
that mean that ] can delegate you to bow and
confess and account to me? Away with such
nonsense, for it is but another scheme by
which the ecclesiastical experts seek, to subor
dinate me civil power.
Ihe men who. founded our Government
placed themseives on the height overlooking
ihe battlefields of the world, and counted the
multitudes that had gone down in blood under
the various forms of ecciesiusticism. and when
they had finished the count of 50,000.000 that
had gone to death under papal oppression
alone, they closed the pages of record and Bald :
Religion is a mutter between man and his God;
we will establish here a Government in which
every man shall have the liberty of worsnip.
ing God according to the dictates of his own
conbcience, and no man shall molest or make
him afraid.
MACCABEES MEET.
A Public Reception To-Night Will Opeii
Their First California Con
vention.
"fhe first California convention of the
Maccabees, a fraternal insurance order
similar to the Foresters, will be held in
this City for three days, beginning to
night with a free public reception and en
tertainment at Union-square Hall.
Four high oilieials of the order from
Tent Number 2, L a Angeles, arrived here
last night an i tootc apartments at tbe Lick
House. They are Charles A. Luckenbacb,
general deputy supreme commander for
Southern California, who is also City Clerk
of Los Angeles; John Spiers, C. J. Walters
and Fred Anthony, and together they con
stitute what is known as tne degree te.im.
To-morrow and Wednesday nights, wi:en
the local members of the urder will meet
in Washington Hall in secret session, this
team will exemplify to them tbe most ap
proved manner of performing the initia
tory ceremony.
They have brought with them what is
said to be the finest and most elaborate
regalia in the 0.-der, and what members of
other secret societies have pronounced
probably the finest of any lodge on the
Pacific Coast.
The Maccabees were first organized in
1878 in Canada, and now have a total
membership in America ol 245,000. About
3000 of these are in California. In Los
Angeles there are six "teats" or lodges,
the original one now having a member
ship of over 600, making it the third
largest a tent" in the world. San Fran
cisco has five tents. Tne object of the
public meeting to-night is to convince
more people of the advantages of the or
der.
It has been estimated that the total
number ot persons attending Sunday
schools throughout tbe world cannot be
less than 18,000,000, with about 2,000,000
teachers.

908 Broadway, Sept. 27. f
;. George R. Morrow, president of the Re
publican Alliance, expressed his intention
.'. a few days ago to prepare an essay on the
â¢ duties cf press committees. There is cer
â â¢ tainly need of just such a task being
.. " undertaken in this city, as recent events
,â¢â¢ have proved. When the alliance wsnt to
â¢ ;.Los Angeles ther*e was a conflict regarding
'-. the dnties of the press committee that
â¢ caused" not a little unpleasantness. A
similar committee was appointed to
â¢'â¢ handle the advance work of last night's
gFcat meeting, and great was the surprise
*â¢ of President Morrow to find that after
â  'â¢issuing a little no me of the meeting a
â¢weeK a^o they retired from active service.
The day before the meeting Mr. Morrow
â¢ constituted himself a press committee of
.-'â¢ one, made the tour of Newspaper Row
and last night the Tabernacle could not
.; . hdld the immense crowd that wanted to
â¢ , â  -hear the oratory and music.
. Mr. Morrow's essay will be very timely.
â¢ 'Snd for -the good of all concerned it is to
be hoped tbat its circulation will be un
,."â¢ limited. It is impossible for correspond
ent's, to -be at and know of all the places
.' .where" the local leaders of the political
â  : .parties are arranging the details of their
: meetings, and it is supposed by all con
; ce.rned. that the press committee is sup
" : plyang ttie matter to the papers. Mr.
: .Morrow, has discovered that such is not
' thecase And yrill start a crusade to rem
â â¢.â edy matters..
â¢ : ;. :Tii.e latest -brand of "whitewash" has
â 'â¢â lb.e.en d-i'sco-vered Dy the officers of the Cen
tral Christian Church. A few days ago
tire .congregation of that church was
.shocked beyond measure when more than
; bail a pace of -a sensational newspaper
. . was giy.en to the' poses that the pastor,
. Rev^.EdwardsDavis, wai to assume in his
[. ", .puipi.t; â¢; The .reverend gentleman was rep
â  ".resented- 'as standing on one leg, falling
. .'-.tragicfclly,, jumping in the air and going
: .^-.tbr-bu^h'. .various, other mountebank per
formances, peculiar to the stage, foreign
*.tb â¢ the 'p.ulr-it. The congregation was
â¢ : shocked and a special meeting of the of
ficers "of ihe church, was called to consider
â¢ the matter. The pastor waÂ« loud in his
denunciation of such methods of direct
| ing publ-ic "attention toward himself and
.was q"ulte:at a loss to "understand how the
â ;. photograp' s-and' interview were secured,
.and .so informed the official body of the
. eh.urchi â¢â¢ . . .
. .'â¢!' The court of inquiry was eminently sat
isfactory to -.all concerned, and they sent
"/"out. 'little' notices, stating, among other
â  things, -that:. '.'After careful examination
: it. has' been' seen -that- said article was pub
.â¢ .-.lished entirely without the knowledge or
.approval.' of pur pastor. The interview
â¢ .â â¢'and' pirotographs were secured from ma
.-. .terial used i.n the .advertisement of a
â  .Lecture" on. 'The Science of Art, 1 in which
â¢ appears the 'Author's Act,' and as such is
â¢ public property."
â¢ Tne n wspaper's side of the affair was
â¢not given out.
V It-is quietly given out that tdere may be
â  'no* city tax livy this year. This sounds
.' like a very wild statement, but theie is
mufch foundation for it. The Council has
â¢ : fixed' its figure and the Mayor has de
. . clared for $1 and not a cent more. The

SHOT A BIG WILDCAT.
A Yotrag I-ady From S an Francisco Is
the Heroine at Mendenhall
Springs.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 27.- A few days
ago Miss Olympia Arrambide was the
heroine of the hour at Mendenhall
Springs. The foxhounds bad "treed" a
wildcat two milesdistant from the springs
in a rough canyon which is given over en
tirely to wild beasts.
Miss Arrambide heard the pleading of
the hounds to come to their assistance, so
she mounted Black Billy, the itjvorito
horse at the springs, and with rifle in hand
headed for the fray.
Tue mountain became so steep that she
finally tied the horse and wound her way
up the hill, with ins assistunce of twigs
from the brusn. She finally reached the
tree where the dogs were holding at bay,
perched on the limb of a spreading oak, a
large wildcat.
Although somewhat fatigued, tbe plucky
youn*; Indy leveled her rifle and the cat
dropped to the earrh. For fear he wan not
dead another was fired into the beast,
which made everything secure. Miss
Arrambide brought back tne beast, and
the skin is now being prepared for a rug
wliich will adorn a prominent part of her
home.
ADOPTED A NEW ROLE.
Mrs. Tunnell's Many Visits to
the Mother of Abe Majors,
the Boy Burglar.
Anxious to Interest Herself in Trying
to Secure a Pardon for the
Young Desperado.
Oaklakp Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 27. |
Mrs. Tunnell of the Brown-Overman
case has appeared in a new role, but will
not be able to bring herself into public no- I
tice by the line of work she is eager to per- |
form.
During the past three weeks Mrs. Lu
cinua Wagner has received visits period
ically from a woman, who offered her serv- i
ices to obtain the release of Abe Majors
from Folsom.
The visitor professed to have great influ
ence, and spoke confidently of being able
to get the boy freed. She cited the case
where she once got a prisoner released
from San Quentin, and boasted of her
power with hard-hearted officials who
were unapproachable by Jeas influential
persons. Mrs. Wagner intuitively felt no
inclination to put her son's case with Gov
ernor Budd Into the mysterious visitor's
bands.
After some half dozen visits some one
recognized the woman, and she admitted
that she was Mrs. Tunnell, and was only
interested in Mr-. Wagner's troubles
through humane promptings, with no de
sire lor glory or money.
However, Mrs. Wagner did not avail
herself of Mrs. Tnnnoll's offer, which
seemed a great surprise to her.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1896.
MYSTERIOUS MAN
OF THE MARSH
Did Old Rodney of Alviso
Leave a Fortune in
His Ark?
SOLD FOB TEX DOLLARS
The Lucky Purchaser Tears the
Floating House to Pieces and
Then Disappears.
LIFE STORY OF A MISER.
Was an Old Pioneer Who Did Little
E 83 Than Excite the Curiosity
of His Neighbors.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Sept. 27. )
"Big George" of Alviso Bought the ark
of his dead friend, Rodney, last week for
$10. It is now believed that he cleared
not less than $10,000 on the deal.
Rodney was the oldest settler of the
Alviso marshes. Nobody living in that
vicinity remembers the time when II d
ney was not on the marsh with his ark.
The old man lived on his ark for years
and was looked upon with some supersti
tion, as it was commonly reported that he
was a miser.
It was known that he came to this coast
in 1849 and that he spent some time at the
mines, because he frequently said so. It
has always been supposed that he was
rich and that he was engaged in some
speculations that yielded handsome re
turns. Sometimes for a period of weeks
he would be missing from his lonely ark,
but on such occasions no one saw him go
and no one saw him return. It was re
ported on one occasion that Rodney had
been seen in San Francisco attired in fine
clothes and bearing all the evidence of
being a gentleman of wealth.
The mysterious old man was very secre
tive in his manner, and when questioned
about himself he never gave any satisiac
tton. He moved his ark about from place
to place, and was known to all the sports
men who visited the marsnes from all the
cities around the bay.
About a week ago Rodney was missed.
Nothing would have been thought of it
had not his dog been seen running about
the top of the ark as if in distress. When
ever the old man had gone away previ- j
ously he had always taken his dog with
him. When two days had passed and he
did not appear some one forcibly entered i
I the ark and found that the old man had
i passed away.
The Coroner of Santa Clara held an in
quest and death was found to be due to
natural causes.
During the lifetime of Rodney the man
who seemed to be better aqnainted with i
him than anybody else was "Big George,"
a well-known man around Alviso. As '
soon as George heard of the old man's
death he bought the ark from the Public
Administrator lor $10.
It is stated that the old miser kept all \
his money in the ark and that he had at
one tirr.e as much as $40,000 in it. At his
death it is believed there was not less than
$20,000. This sum George is supposed to
have got for his purchase.
A visit to the ark to-day disclosed a
very intereÂ«ting state of affairs. Every
piece of lining had been torn down, the
flooring had been removed and it was
evident that a most thorough ransacking
of the nremi-es had taken place. What
ever was in the ark has gone and so has
George. No one has seen him or been
able to find him since he made his pur
chase.
Rodney often said he had no relatives
and he often expressed a fear during his
life that he might be robbed. During ail
the years of his residence, however, he
was never molested, but passed as Alviso' s
man of mystery.
ASK PAY FOR DEAD COWS
Dairymen Believe They Should
Be Compensated for Stock
Destroyed.
The Coming Convention Will Devote
Much Tim? to Discussing
Tuberculosis
Dairymen in the counties surrounding
the bay and, in a lesser degree, all persons
interested in the dairy industry through
out the State are looking anxiously to the
convention which is to be held in the
Chamber of Commerce rooms Tuesday
and Wednesday, in many respects this
the third convention of the California
Dairy Association is of the utmost im
portance, but pre-eminent among the
topics to be considered is the extermina
tion of cows affected with tuberculosis.
The officials of the association are anx
ious that it shall not appear they are in
any way opposing the Board of Health in
its fforts to procure pure milk to con
sumers, but they seek some method of
making the burden of the reform less
onerous to owners of cattle.
They are also anxious to determine just
what steps are actually necessary to pro
tect the public and what view the highest
authorities take of the prevalence of the
epidemic and its effects. To this end they
have invited Dr. P. K. Brown, represent
ing the Academy of Sciences, U. C. Roidy
of the San Francisco Microscopical So
ciety, E. Jaffa of the agricultural depart
ment of the University of California, Pro
f"SÃor C. W. Wood worth, Dr. R. H.
Freund of the Microscopical Society, Pro
fessor E. J. Wicfcson and others to read
papers bearing on this important subject.
"\Ve hope," said Samuel E. Watson,
secretary of the association, "that in the
views of these men we will find something
favorable to the dairy interests, but we
havo no intimation to that effect, and,
whatever their views may be, we are will
ing to stand by them. What we wish is
an intelligent discussion of the subject in
order that we may know the truth and act
accordingly."
Major Henry E. Alvord of the United
States Bureau of Animal Industries will
arrive in the City to-morrow, and from
him many valuable suggestions are ex
pected. Major Alvord has in bis trip
across the continent attended several con
ventions, and he comes fully prepared to
instruct toe association on the methods
pursued elsewhere. He is considered one
of the highest authorities in the country
upon dairy matters.
As a measure of practical relief a recom
mendation will be introduced that legisla
tive provision be made for reimbursing
stock-owners whose cattle are killed by the
autnorities in cases where no attempt is
made to conceal the presence ot tubercu
losis when known. Such laws prevail in
a large number of the States where dairy
inspection prevails, tne measure of com
pensation being one-ualf the value of the
stock as determined by arbitration.
On account of the unusual interest being
displayed at least 200 delegates are ex
pected. _

CRICKET ACROSS THE BAY
A Drawn Match Between the
Pacific and Alameda
Elevens,
While the Bohemians Easily Defeat
the Californians at
Golden Gate.
Two cup cricket matches were played
yesterday. That at Alameda, between
the club of that name and the Pacifies, was
particularly interesting and resulted in a
draw, slightly in favor of the latter. Cap
tain G. Theobald, winning the toss, sent
his opponents in to bat. With two excep
tions every member of the team contrb
uted to a total of a century and a half.
Captain Hogue, Sloman and Hood all
played rattling innings, the latter's 35
being especially meritorious, The field
ing of the Pacihcs was anything but up to
their standard â a remark, by the way, that
applies to both -ides.
At 3:45 the Pacifies started to bat, and it
aueura well for their play that before the
call of time they came within 32 of their
antagonists' score and with the loss of 7
wickets. The scores:

Nervousness of Public Speakers.
Who is the illustrious statesman to
whom Mr. Chamberlain thus alluded in
his spaech to the Cordwainers last night:
"I recollect a good number of years ago
asking an illustrious statesman ahd orator
whether he ever felt nervous before mak
ing a speech, and he said that as a rule he
did not, but tnat there were exceptions;
and I then asked him, still inquisitive,
what were the exceptions, and alter a few
minutes' thought he said, 'Well, there is
tue Lord Mayor's dinner [laughter] when
1 havo to reply for her Majesty's Minis
ters.' "
This, we imagine, is Mr. Gladstone, for
he was among the very lew great orators
who were not generaliy nervous before
making a public speech. John Bright, as
is well known, was extraordinar.lv ner
vous, and spent many a miserable q'.iar.er
of an hour before rising to speak. Lord
Beaconsfield was not happy, and on both
front benches in the House of Commons
at present may be seen eminent men who
are reduced to a pitiable condition before
ttieir time comes to take part in debate,
it is a maiady which neither time nor ex
perience will cure, and all that the victim
Can generally do is to practice himseli in
its concealment. â Westminster Gazette.
An error of a thousandth part of a

WORLD TANDEM RECORDS
Fast Time Made on the San Lean
dro Road by the Bay
City Wheelmen.
Reliance, Olympic and Garden City
Road Races Create Great
Enthusiasm.
The largest crowds, best races and fast
est time of the year characterized the
wheelmen's road races held over the San
Leandro-Hay wards course yesterday. The
roads were fine, the weather perfect and
the way the wheelmen turned out should
set at rest the suggestion that wheeling is
in its decadence.
The Bay City Wheelmen's tandem race
resulted in some phenomenally fast time
being made. C. A. Kraft and George S.
Dizon covered the coarse in 10:22 4-5, a
world's record for the distance. T. A.
Griffitns and John Davidson made it in
10:38, another world's record.
The following score shows the different
performances:
C. A. Kraft and Georee E. Dixon, 10:22 4-5.

B. C. Raynaud made a five-mile record
trial at San Leandro in 12:00 2-5 and Wal
ter Davidson did the same in 11:30.
Tne racing was all remarkable in one
respect â there were no accidents of any
kind, none of the usual breakdowns, tum
ble- and the like, which generally mar
road-racing.
Tne timing was particularly accurate
and in the hands of experienced men. At
San Leandro it was bandied by William
Ysoman. H. F. Terrill, J. F. Hancock and
A. W. Rhys. At Haywards by George P.
Wetmore, R. C. Lenni-, Wiiber F. Enapp,
H. C. Clark, P. H. Higgins and H. W.
Bpalding. At San Jose by George H.
Stratton, H. D. Hadenfeldt, J. A. Desi
mnne, Al Col and C. N. Ravlin.
Taken altogether yesterday showed a
great revival in the interest in cycle road
racing and the fast time made over the
San Leandro course will doubtless induce
all the other clubs to hold events in the
near future.

THE PRACTICAL MAN.
As Viewed From the Standpoint of the
Theosophist.
At a meeting of the Theosophical Society
in Golden Gate Hall last evening, James
H. Gnffes read a very carefully prepared
and logical paper, setting forth what is a
practical man from the standpoint of the
theosophist. Snch a man he described as
one who is not actuated by selfishness,
but whose ideas are so broad that they
enable him to think and act for the better
ment of mankind. Such a man, he said,
is a lender in public affairs, and his leader
ship is not for self but for the general
public good. The lecturer entered into the
various phases that go to make up an an
saltish man, and told how such a man
becomes more useful in the community in
which be lives, and bow the example he
sets leads people to think and study. The
people, he said, are becoming more altru
istic, and day by clay are becoming more
unseltish, and that it is a noticeable fact
that the churches are broadening in this
age of education and advancement, when
the people are become more practical in
every branch and are reaching out for ttoe
real things of life. In conclusion he de
clared that the practical mau is tho one
who knows himself.
Tne lecture, delivered in a clear and
forcible manner, was listened to with a
great deal of attention and was heartily
applauded.
Sorry He Spoke.
A tramcar was proceeding down one of
our busy thoroughfares the oth-r Sunday
and was already comfortably full, when it
was hailed by a laboring man considerably
the worse for liquor, who presently stag
gered along the car, between two rows of
well-dressed people, regardless alike of
polisned shoes and tender feet.
Murmurs and complaints arose on all
sides, and demands were heard that the
offender should be summarily ejected. But
amid the storm of abuse one friendly voice
was raised, as a benevolent clergyman rose
from the seat, saying:
"No, no; let the man sit down and be
quiet."
The discomfiture of the party turned to
mirth when the inebriated one seized his
benefactor by the hand, exclaiming:
"Thank ye, sir; thank ye. I see you
know what it is to be drunk I"â -Chicago
Times-Herald.

from parental care, dies of either grief or

RUSSEL PITCHED WELL
Oakland Ballplayers Beat the
San Franciscos in the
Last Inning.
The Visitors Outbatted the Local Men
and Also Outclassed Them
in the Field.
The Oaklands crossed the bay yesterday
with a choice collection of their best bats,
and the way they wielded them when
they arrived at the Folsom-street grounds
made Pitcher Cooney long for the medi
cine that relieves one of "that tired feel
ing." Every man of the visiting team,
except Donovan, hit safely, and Arlett,
Jphnson and "Welters each secured three
hits. One of Johnson's drives was a home
run, and one of Wolters' a three-bagger.
Although the stick work of the Church
City men is responsible for their victory,
great credit is due Pitcher Russel, whose
work was excellent throughout. Russel
struck out ten men, gave but three bases
on balls, and allowed the locals but seven
hits, no two of which were bunched, ex
cept in the third inning, when the San
Franciscos secured three runs on hits by ;
Krue, Murphy and Scott and errors by
Arlett and Agnew.
As Cooney was also keeping the bits
well scattered it looked as though, with a
lead of tnree, Blake's men would win.
Oakland, however, scored one in the fourth
on hits by Ariett and Wolters and John
son's out. and tied the score in the sixth
on Johnson's single, Wolters' triple. and
Pequi<?ney's fly to center. .
Each side got a man around the circuit
in the eighth, much to the delight of the
crowd on the bleachers, which settled
down for an extra inning game. The small
boys were doomed to di appointment,
however, for no less than ten of the Oak
lands went to the bat in the ninth inning,
and when the third out had been made
four of them had succeeded in crossing
the plate. In their half of the final inning
the locals were unable to get a man as far
as second.

Some Lesser Games.
A game of baseball was played at the
Park yesterday between the Boraxaidsand
the Oakland Famous, which was won by
the former club by a score of 9to 8. The
battery was Hennessy and Lane for the
Boraxaids, and Feige and Whaiey and
Brock"ff for the Famous.
The Evening Bulletins had an easy thing
of it ysterday with the Strauss & Btrausa
at the Presidio Krounds. The effective bat
tery work of O'Toole and Ferguson,
coupled with a succession of double plays,
won the game for the Bulletins. The din
ners were heavy batters throughout. Fol
lowing is the score by innings:
Bulletins 2 3 S 0 1 7 â¢â l6
Strauss A Straus* 0 0 0 O 1 a 3â 6
An exciting game of baseball was played
to-day at Golden Gate Recreation Grounds
between the OaKland Famous and Eurekas,
the latter winning by a score of 9 to 8.
The feature was the grand catch of Trouin
in the last inning, with three men on
bases.
THE SAPIENT GROW.
Can Count lp to Twenty-Six and Has a
Touch of Iron.
A naturalist, who is much interested in
birds, says that the crow is the wisest of
all feathered animals. He has made a
number of experiments recently, and de
clares that an ordinary, well-educated
crow can count to twenty, and that be has
found a Bentinel crow, very old and very
wise, that can count to twenty -six. He
made these discoveries in a very interest
ing way.
Last summer he spent much time in the
mountains, where a cadet company ot boys
was camped. One day he found a flock of
crows gathered around a dead animal that
Jay near a little old shanty in the woods.
They flapped away when he approached.
So he hid himself tn the old shanty and
waitud, but they would not come back.
Then he went out and walked on up the
mountain and they all settled down again
to the feast.
That afternoon be took four boys from

the cadet camp with him, and the five
marched into the little building and
waited. No crows came back. Two of the
boys went out. Stiil no crows. Then the
otuer two went out and only the natural
ist remained. But the old sentinel crow
had evidently counted them as they went
in and he knew they had not all come out.
So he sat on a dry pine stump and said
"caw, caw," quite derisively. At last the
naturalist left the building, and straight
way all the crows returned. This expe
ment was repeated a number of -times
with varying numbers of boys, but the
crows kept count and would not come
down until the building was entirely
empty.
At last a whole platoon of the cadets,
twenty-six boys in all, and the naturalist,
marched into the old building. Then
slowly twenty of them went away. The
crows did not stir. Two more, four more,
five more went, but the old sentinel
warned his companions that the men had
not all gone. Then the twenty-sixth ca
det marched away, leaving only the nat
uralist. In a very few minutes there were
a number of hopeful caws and a, flapping
of wines and the crows returned. The old
sentinel could evidently count twenty-six,
but numbers beyond this puzzled him.
The experiment "was tried several times
more, and it was found that the Crows
could keep the count up to twenty, hat
beyond ti.at they were uncertain. This
shows that the crow is a very wise* old
bird. â Chicago Record.

NEW SUNDAY-SCHOOL.
Annex to Olivet Presbyterian Church
Dedicated Yesterday.
The new Sunday-school room of the
Olivet Presbyterian Church on Mississippi
street, between Napa and Butte, was dedi
cated yesterday afternoon. The services
'were simple and began at 3 o'clock. A
large congregation of young people was
present.
The new Sunday-school room is an an
nex to the church. It cost about $1400
and is commodious, well lighted and
cheerful. The money was raised by con
tributions and church entertainments.
The young people brought flowers and
roses to decorate the church, and Rev. E.
G. Mathena, the pastor. Rev. D. W. Chil
son of the Potrero Methodist Chnrch,
Rev. R. W. Reynolds of the Holly Park
Presbyterian Church and Rev. H. N.
tJevier of the Memorial Presbyterian
Church of South Ban Francisco partici
pated in leading the services. The dedi
catory sermon was preached by Rev. H. C.
Min ton, D. D.. of the San Francisco Theo
logical School. His topic was "The Free
dom of Salvation," and he took his text
from Revelation* xxii, 17 â "Whosoever
will, let him take of the water of life
freely.' 1 He said that while salvation was
wholly free it cost a renunciation of all
that was displeasing in the sight of God.
He said he thought that in some cases sal
vauon did not cost enough. "No man
loves God," he said, "who does not want
other people to love him and share him.
That is wiiat this new building means to
day."
Pastor Mathena read the dedicatory
portion from the ritual, and the services
ended with the singing of "Nearer, My
God, to Thee," and a benediction by the
pastor. ______^_^^^_
LADIES AT THE TRAPS,
The Empire and Golden Gate
Gun Clubs Make an
Innovation
The Fair Sex Enjoy the Sport of
Breaking B ucrocks at Ala
meda Point.
Alameda Point was the scene of two in
teresting events in the sporting world yes
terday. At the Pacific Tournament As
sociation grounds the first grand inani
mate target tournament of the Golden
Gate Gun Club was appropriately cele
brated, and, as was anticipated, attracted
a very large attendance of competitors.
The Empire Gun Club also closed the blue
rock season with its final club shoot and a
special prize match for lady members.
The executive of the Golden Gate Gun
Club and all who helped to promote that
organization's initial tournament have
everj r reason to coneratulate themselves
upon an unquestionable success. Starting
at 9:30 a. 'm., the various events of the
comprehensive programme were pulled off
punctually and with scarcely any hitches.
This nappy state of affairs is in a great
measure attributable to the efforts of
"Sandy" Allen, the manager of events,
and to his assistant manager, T. L. Lewis.
The judges were J. R. D. Grubb, H. A.
Hoyt and Charles Sonntae, whose deci
sions were rarely appealed from.
The day was chiefly remarkable for a
feature which will doubtless recommend
itself to the adherents of the "new
woman" movement. The Empire Gun
Club, as already intimated, introduced a
ladies' match into its programme and the
Golden Gate Gun Club did the same for
the first time in its history. Mrs. Eis
feldt of tbe former club created quite a
sensation by breaking eight out of ten
birds, a performance whicb, when criti
cized independently of the sex of the fair
markswoman, was an excellent one.
In the case of tbe ladies' match at the
Golden Gate Gun Club's tournament Mrs.
Price was awarded the special prize for a
score of 2 out of ten singles, while Mrs.
Eisfel'lt. less successful than in her earlier
achievement over the way, won the first
prize, with a score of 2 also.
The two most exciting events of the day
at the tournament were admittedly
the prize shoot, twenty sincles, and the
shoot-off for the novice gold medal, fifty
birds, straight away. Henry Betten of
the Encinal Gun Club won" the much
coveted trophy last August, but on this
occasion Mr. Hulzer secured it temporar-
I ily, with a total score of 43, as against
Betten 's 33. The medai must be won two
years running before it becomes the abso
lute property of any competitor; so next
year's tournament is bound to prove
doubly exciting. The prize shoot was di
vided up into thirteen classes, and resulted
as fellows. The aggreeate scores are
given first and the classified result after

More than 8000 bloerocks were disposed
of at this tournament, but large as this
total undoubtedly is the club hopes to do
even better on the next occasion. At the
Empire grounds the great event of the
day was the club shoot final, in which Mr.
Billington, who shot in the first class,
carried off first money, with a score of 25
out of 30 birds. The full scores are as fol

proceedings.
KILLING LIVE PIGEONS.
Prince Poniaitowski Proves Him
self Handy With a Shotgun.
The regular shoot of the California
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 18Â»f>.
Wing Shooting Club was held yesterday
at San Bruno and during the day thirty
two dozen pigeons were killed or shot at
by the members of tbe club and their
friends. Among the latter was Prince
Poniaitowski, who appeared arrayed in an
immaculate suit of white duck and a pair
of nntanned kid gloves, which he wore at
the traps, The Prince has a fine European
record as a trap-shooter and yesterday he
shot up to his reputation, making some
excellent kills and dropping his twelve
straight in the first sweepstakes at twelve
birds. He used his second barrel only
once. "Slade" and Bob Liddle Jr. also
killed all their birds. The conditions were
twelve birds, twenty-eight yards rise,lss
entrance. The scores stood as follows:
Blade 12, Prince Poniaitowski 12, R. Liddle,
Jr., 12, Wagner 11, C. Bobinsou 10, Bier 6.
The $30 was divided among Prince Pon
iaitowski, Liddle and Slade.
The next sweepstake was under the
same conditions. Frank Maskey killed
his twelve straight in grand shape.
"Slade" ran him a close second with
eleven.
Robinson, Liddle and Fay each killed
ten, me Prince killed eight and Bier got
seven. There was considerable betting on
this event and several dollars changed
hands. The scores stood as follows:
Maskey 12, Slade 11, Robinson 10, Liddle
10, Fay 10, Wagner 10, Prince Poniaitowski 8,
Bier 7.
Maskey took first money and Slade sec
ond.
After the main events a seres of sweep
stakes was shot off at six birds, $2 50 en
trance, best score to win. Wagner wou
the first with a clean score of 6. Robin
son won the second with another clean
score and divided the third with Achille
Rons, both killing all their birds.
The State Sportsmen's big shoot comes
off at San Bruno on Friday and Saturday
next, and Roberts, who has tbe contract
for the birds, will have 150 dozen first-class
flyers in nanrt for the occasion.

In spite of the fact that yesterday was
the Sabbath local Democratic politicians
were- busy making slates and combina
tions to control the coming election.
The Examiner's sudden conversion to
the . let-alone policy of passive non-inter
ference has given both the Buckley and
Rainey wings of the corrupt Democracy
hew* courage.
â¢Given renewed courage by the "hands
off" policy of the Democratic organ that
lately urged that Buckley and Rainey
ought Â£0 be sent to prison, the Rainey
crowd met in caucus last night at the
re.- idence of the invincible Sam and there
made a slate for Supervisors. The names
selected by the unholy brood were not
rriade public; but an old and respected
Democrat-, who learned what was in the
wind, thus expressed his disgust to a Call
reporter :
'â¢'They "have met in a shameless way, se
lected their tools and will promulgate the
rrames of their men to-morrow night. I
think it is high time that honest men of
tihe Denfocracy werÂ« organizing to go over
to Â«6me prganijZation of known strength
that stands for purity. MarK my words;
Cplojiel Taylor will get many a good Dem
ocratic.vote. ' :
It was said at a late hour last night that
tÃe conduct of Rainey at last night's cau
cus wa.> that of at> ab-oiute dictator; that
everything in the programme had been
s.elected witrh the greatest particularity
and that no one dared overrule what the
loca'i bossjiad planned.

tend the mission now being conducted by
the Redemptorist fathers, O'Shea and
Mullane.
All day yesterday St. Joseph's was vis
ited by devout members of the parish, and
at hours of service there was barely room
enough for those who were eager to be
present.
In the morning there was a solemn high
mass at which Concone's mass in Â£ flat
was sung by the talented choir, but even
earlier â before daybreakâ the church wua
filled with young women. They were then
conducing a week of prayer and spiritual
exercises. They aeain attended in the
afternoon, folly 1500 of them, when the
mission to them came to a clo-c. At this
service the choir pang MiJard's l> Veni
Creator," the "Magnificat" from Moznrt's
"Twelfth Mass," Millard's "Tantum
Erco," Rosewig's "Lauaate Dominum"
and a beautiful duet for soprano and bary
tone was given in the "OI Salutaris," by
Verdi.
The mission for married men opened at
night, when there were about 1200 men in
the congregation. Father Mullane, G. S.
8. R., preached on the immortality of the
*oul. He showed that the proof could be
known by. faith and the teaching of God;
by the judgment of a man's own con
science and by the justice and holiness of
God. His deductions were that man's
only and most important work in the
world ana most urgent affair was the sal
vation of the soul.
The evening services concluded with
benediction. On Wednesday or Thursday
evening a special lecture will be delivered
by one of the Redemptonsts on"The Duties
and Obligations of the Married State."
During the week ail men doing the mis
sion will attend as 5 :30 a. m. and 7:30 p. m.
each day, and many will be present at the
9 o'clock morning services.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1896.
FIRED TWO SHOTS
AT HIS FRIEND
Why Frank Carnivali
Sought to Kill Young
George Zitka.
HELD THE BRIDE'S HAND
Only a Few Hours Married, the
Groom Promptly Resented
Such Familiarity.
THE MARRIAGE FEAST ENDED.
How a New Husband Lands in Prison
With an Assault to Murder
Charge Against Him.
Married at 2 o'clock and in less than five
hours behind prison bars with an assault
to murder charge resting against him is
a chapter in the life of Frank Carnivali
which he will remember as long as ne
lives. His incarceration is due to an at
tempt to kill George ZitKa because the lat
ter insisted on shaking hands with the
bride. Incidentally it may be remarked
that the groom had looked often on the
! wine when it was red, hence he was in a
proper condition to resent any fancied in
sult offered his fair young wife.
Yesterday afternoon Frank Carnivali, a
window-washer, was married to Filomena
Campolongo, a pretty-faced, black-eyed
Italian girl who acknowledges to 22 sum
mers. Father de Carolis of the Saint Pe
ter and Saint Paul Church performed t!<e
ceremony and then sent the happy couple
on their way rejoicing.
Mr. and Mrs. Carnivali took in the
sights of the City, and at 4 o'clock repaired
to the home of the groom, 4 Pollard place,
where the bridal dinner was to be served.
About 5 o'clock the guests began to ar
rive, among them being George Zitka, a
bootblack, who, it seems, had been an ar
dent admirer of the bride in the days
when she was simply Filomena Campo
longo. This fact, however, did not, at
least at that time, disturb the bubbling
happiness of Carnivali and his guests.
In time the quests were seated around
the banquet table, and everythine went
as smoothly as the proverbial marriage
bell. It is said there was wine in plenty,
and further that the glasses, including
that of the host, was not allowed to be
come empty. It was right in the midst cf
the feast that the trouble occurred, but as
to just what brougit it about nobody
seems to be quite positive.
It is generally said, however, and the
story is accepted by the police, that Zitka
finally so far succumbed to the inspiring
influences of the occasion that he essayed
to shower his congratulations on the young
wif<> in rather a boisterous manner. Fi
na y he grasped the hand of the briile and
was about to say something appropriate
to the occasion, when Carnivali, enraged
at what he thought was an insult, pulled
his pistol and before any one could inter
fere fired two shots at the a.-tomsne<l
Zitka. Both took effect, tnough fortu
nately the wounds were not of a serious
character. Oue went throu h the fiVshy
part of the left side and the other shat
tered the ri^ht wrist.
Of course the unexpected shooting put
au immediate end to the festivities. Offi
cer Hac&ett placed Carnivali under arrest
and sent Zitka to the Receiving Hospital,
where his injuries were properly dressed
by Dr. James F. Kearney.
Carnivali when seen at the prison last
night expressed great regret for the un
happy ending of a day wuich started out
so joyfully.
"I do not know just how it happened."

had drunk considerable wine. They began
to tease me, and then blood came in my
eyes, and I don't remember just what fol

care to say now.''
The charge of assault to murder has
been placed opposite the name 01 Carnivali.
Up to a Jate hour last night he had not
sucoec'.ed in uiving bail, which was fixed
at $2000.
NEW JERUSALEM
Rev. D. V. Bo wen Preached Yesterday
on the Subject of Per
fection.
At the New Jerusalem Church, oh
O'Farrell street, yesterday, Rev. D. V.
Bowen spoke upon ''Perfection," taking
for his text, "Be ye therefore perfect, even
as your Father which is in heaven is per
fect." He said:
From the words immediately preceding the
text we are teupht that perfection is not tne
perfection of the infinite wisdom of God or of
his Infinite power, but the perfection of good
ness. *nd we are not to take imperfect man an
our Ideal, but the fatherly principle in God.
We need this high angelic standard to In
splte lofty aims and enrneet <ffort. When we
overcome wrong habits we should desire and
strive alter a change of thought and feeling.
We cannot attain thin higher wisdom aud
purer love in a moment by a miraculous oper
ation.
Immediately after service a meeting of
the society was apain called to vote for
I pastor. On t'.:e first ballot Mr. Bowen was
â  elected by more than a two-tbirds vote.
Cruelty to a Dog.
Louisa Debernardi, a quiet, modest little
girl 14 years of aÂ«c, was taken to the City
Prison yesterday morning by her pareuts, as

tered and released on $40 cash bail furnished
by Attorney Walter Gallagher. Tbe complain

THE QUEEN OF SHEBA
1 Lesson Closely Allied to Leading
Question* Among Women
To-Day.
A very practical lesson was based on
I. Kings x:l-13, in Mrs. Cooper's class yes
terday. The teacher remarked in opening
tne lesson: "The Queen of Sbeba was an
earnest inquirer; she wished to investigate
for herself â to ask her own questions.
And the King graciously answered all her
questions. Every person has particular
inquiries, doubts, desires and opinions.
The inquiry is never the same. No one
can ask another person's questions. Re
member tliat, and alway asks your own
questions. Questions may be identical in
phraseology and yet be different in tone,
quality, starit and exi-re^oion. This noted
Queen put herself to much trouble on her
own spiritual account. We can afford to
take great pains to get spiritual knowl
edge. Sbe was prepared to listen. This
saves a vast amount of time. No one can
speak to any purpose who has not the
hearts and ears of his audience. If we
would hear heaven's messages we must
listen for them. 'Speak, Lord, for thy ser
vant heareth. 1 There would be greater
preachers if there were gjeater hearers.
Every fresh and vital question that
comes from an inspired listener is a fresh
incentive for deeper study and diviner
trustÂ«n the great mspirer. The spirit of
God is the inspiring power. The Queen of
Sheba was moved by this all-pervading
spirit of God. Just think what a journey
sue took of four or five months â about
2000 miles, over a scorched and stony
road. She never would have taken that
journey had she not been starving for

Arrival of Thomas M<Â°in, Man

The Story of His Rapid Rise, Political
Experiences and the Big Mines

Captain Thomas Mem, the noted Cali

who for four and a half years paÂ«t has
befcn manager of the ereat Robinson Gold
Mining Company and director in several
other companies at Johannesburg, South
A rica, arrived herÂ» Saturday night. He is
accompanied by Mrs. Mem and their two
sons, R. M. and W. W. Mem.
Captain Mem was n member of the
celebrated Reform Committee of Johan
nesburg, and was one of the Ameri
cans who wns imprisoned there. He
served in all five week- in prison,
and was fined also $10000, and when
the charge against him was <Msmissed he
was required to take no part in politics
for three years. The captain's long trip
has been a little trying on him and he was
not feeling well.
He has returned to take up his perma
nent headquarters in San Francisco as ihe
representative of the London Exploration
Company, probably the greatest mining
company in the world. In this capacity
he will manage tne Alaska Treadw 11,
Mexican and United Mining companies,
in Alaska ; the One da. in Amador County ;
the Sieeplerock, in New Mexico, and the
Grand Central, in Mexico. These are all
gold mines. Captain Mem will also ex
amine the mines and make purchases for
ihccompany. Hamilton Smith, formerly
of this City, is ihe engineer of the London
Exploration Company, and Sir Horace
Farquhar is president of it.
Tne company has several subordinate
companies, among them being theF;ench
Exploration and the Australian Explora
tion companies. There is an immense
amount of money backing them, much of
which has Oeen made in South African
mines.
W. W. Mem has been for some time
past manager of the Robinson Gold Min
ing Company's chlorination works, while
R. M. Mem has been engaged in import
ing timber from Australia for use in the
mines. His partner, Walter D. Davies.
an Australian, is one of the two young
men yet in prison because of the South
African political difficulties.
R. M. Mem says Africa is a magnificent
country and that there is almost no preju
dice against Americans there. Money is
very plentiful, but mining property is very
hi^ti. Captain Mem has acquired a large
lortune in South Africa, a fortune not sur
passed by any other American mining
man. It is said to amount to a princely
sum.

HANGED BY HIS
FOUR-IN-HAND
Architect J. B. Mathisen
Ends His Life With a
Necktie
UNDER A CYPRESS TREE.
Selects a Lonely Spot in the
Berkeley Woods lor His
Rash Act
DESPONDENCY THE CAUSE.
For Some Time Past He Had Been
Under a Cloud of Mis
fortune.
BERKELEY, Cal m Sept. 27.â An extra
ordinarily peculiar case of suicide took
place in Berkeley some time during last
night. Joachim B. Mathisen, a well-
known San Francisco architect and a
member of tiie firm of Howard <fe M&ttx
lsen, dome business in the Crocker build
ing. Ban Francisco, strangled himself to
death in the woods to the rear of the
Blind Asylum, with a four-in-hand neck
tie which he had suspended to a small
cypress branch.
Despondency throuen complication of
business affairs is attributed as the cause
of the deed.
The peculiar phase of the case lies in
the fact that the branch to which he had
hung himself was only about three feet
from the ground. When found Mathisen
was in a kneeling posture, his bead
thrown forward, and his hands and arms
dangling by his sides.
He bad literally strangled himself to
death. There was not the slightest sign
of struggle or that he had passed through
any paroxysms of pain while in the tnroes
of death. He ad gone to the lonely >pot
in the woods, and in an evident fit of mo
mentary insanity had deliberately an 1 in
a spint of determination which had char
acterized his life committed suicide. He
had been despondent for some time past
because of the heavy load of business af
fairs with which he was weighted down,
but his rash act came as a great surprise
to his fienis, both in Berkeley and in
San Francisco.
The deed was wholly premeditated, for
in his pocket was found a postal card ad
dressed to C. B. Vorce, a draughtsman in
his office, with the following written on
the back: "Please look for directions in
safe. â M." Tl;at he purposed ending his
life last night does not seem to follow, be
cause of the peculiar method he employed
in tying the four-in-hand about his neck.
His body was not found until this morn
ing when a stranger, who happened to be
walking through the grove of trees, dis
covered it and bore the news to Joseph
Alkulay, who lives near the asylum.
Douglas Keith, who lives in a house ad
joining that of Alkalay, and with whom
Mathisen boarded for the past year, went
with Alkalay to the scene. Keith was
overcome when he discovered that the
suicide was his friend Mathisen.
The dead architect came to the United
States from his native country, Norway,
about ten years ago, and in 1891 set up
business in San Francisco with William
Howard on Montgomery street.
Mathisen was well acquainted with the
late l'age Brown, and when the latter died
last year he and his partner took charge
ot Brown's business in the Crocker build
ing. Soon afterward Howard was taken
ill and had to go to Japan for his health,
leaving Mathissen in entire charge of the
business.
He had undertaken to carry too much.
A high office rental and a decreasing
monthly income did not go well together.
Mathisen had a few nundred dollars
when he took the office, but he spent it all
in keeping up expenses.
Douglas Keith, with whom he boarded,
said that he knew the deceased architect
had been hard pressed for some time, but
being a man of strung determination, be
lieved that he would overcome the difficul
ties confronting him. Mathisen was
generally known as temperate and up
right in all His dealings on this side of the
bay.
Several of the most artistic houses in
Berkeley were designed by him, among
which are the residences ot Pro essor E.
B. Clapp, Anson Blake and Douglas
Keith. Last year he was nppoimed by
the Town B >a/d of Elucation to draw up
a set of plans for the proposed new High
School building. He has recently been at
work on the plans of the new school build
ing to be erected at Dwight way and at
North Berkeley. H*Â» was a member of
Live Oak Ludge of Masons in Oakland.
An inquest will be held to-morrow.
Charles B. Vorce, an architect em
ployed as draughtsman by Mathissen, was
seen last evening at his home in Oakland.
He ascribes the suicide to general de
spondency over business prospects. He
said that Mathissen released two em
ployes within the last few days.
The Mohawk Indians will not allow so
n\uch as a blade of grass to grow upon the
graves of their companions.
