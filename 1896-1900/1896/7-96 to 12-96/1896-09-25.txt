THREE DELEGATIONS MANI-
FEST THEIK LOYALTY.
Men of All Classes Cheer the Next
President for His Championship
of Protection.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept 24.â This was one
of the most picturesque days of the Presi
dential campaign in Canton. There was
abundance of music, flowers and pretty
women. The delegations numbered three
to-aay. The first, composed of miners,
came from West Newton, Pa. Tney ar
rived shortly before noon and had not
gone long before an interesting delegation
from Oil City marched up the streets,
cheered at every step by the enthusiastic
spectators. This delegation came in a
special train composed largely of Pullman
cars, for it contained a large number of
ladies.
The bands, preceded by the Canton
troop of mounted horsemen, headed the
delegation. Then came the McKinley and
Hobart Club and the First Voters' Club of
Oil City and forty-rive pretty young
women, each representing one State ol
the Union, and each carrying a largg bas
ket overflowing with beautiful roses.
From each basket streamers of colored
ribbon bearing the name of the State de
pended.
After tbe girls came a marching dub of
300. A large number of the most promi
nent men of Oil City, with their wives and
daughters, walked in the parade. It was
a remarkable delegation in this respect.
At Major McKinley's a pyramidal stand
ti.ieen f<*ot ingii, twenty feet broad at th*
base and six feet at the apex had been
erected by direction of the Oil City people
and tne great baskets of flowers with their
streaming ribbons were placed upon ii,
forming an apparently solid pyramid of
rose? fifteen feet high. After the speech
making each girl handed her basket of
roses to Major McKinley, who passed
them over to attendants to piace on the
stand. While tbe delegation was waiting
for the speeches rousing cheers for Mrs.
McKinley and Major McKinley's mother
were given.
The third and last delegation was from
Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. It
was largely composed of miners and glass
workers. The Westmoreland delepaiion
was 3000 strong. It was made up of voters
of Greensbnrg, Scottdale, Latrobe, Ligion
ire, Mammoth and Mount Pleasant, and it
took three special trains to carry it.
Major McKinley was in excellent condi
tion to-day and spoke with much clear
ness and vigor. In response to the spokes
man for the Oil City delegation he said:
This is indeed a very great honor and
tribute to a patriotic and noble cause. My
fellow-citizens, what could be more beautiful
or more inspiring than to have these young
ladies representing every State of the Ameri
can Union on this lawn to-day to testify their
devotion to the principles and purposes and
aspirations of this great Union of States ?
[Great applause.J You come from the great
oii district of Pennsylvania and know better
than 1 can tell you the amazing growth of
your industry.
The system I would favor for the country i*
the system of the fathers â a system which
came in with the Government, a system with
which we have had the highest degree of pros
perity; which seeks the same growth in popu
lation, the same increase in wealth, the same
diffusion of prosperity everywhere that you
have enjoyed in Pennsylvania. [Applause.]
If you will but glance at the census map
showing the proportion of improved and un
improved lands in the United States; if you
will consider for an instant the cause of our
increased population; if you will take into
calculation oar marvelous resources, which
are as yet but little known, I think you will
agree with me that we ought to have a dis
tinct and pronounced industrial and com
niercial policy, genuinely American and thor
oughly patriotic. [Great applause.] Factories
should increase all over this country, and
when the factories increaie mines increase,
and when both increase the home market for
the farmer is improved and his prices are bet
ter. [Great applause aud cries of "That's
right."]
Let as not be disturbed by our production,
bui rather take means of preventing the- under
consumption of American products by pre
serving and enlarging our home market and
extending our foreign markets beyond the
sea. [Applause and cries of "Good, pood."]
Let us continue the policy of Washington
Hamilton, Jefferson, Lincoln, of Grant, Ste
vens of your own State [applause] and Cam
eron, Blnine and Garfield, and the scores of
other distinguished statesmen whose great
services made the greatest and most prosper
ous country of the world. Equal credit could
perhaps be accorded to others than the illus
trious names 1 have mentioned, but greater
distinction none can claim. [Cneers.J Their
first, their nob'.est, their highest aspirations
were for America and Americans. [Renewed
cheering.] We want a better American senti
ment. [Cries of "That's right, major."] We
..ant to cultivate a higher National spiri;.
We want to keep high the American name.
[Applause]
Tiie great men who founded Pennsylvania,
the great men who founded the Government,
the great men who have since sustained it In
war and peace would have revolted at the
thought of repudiation and National dishonor.
[Tremendous cheering.] They would have
looked upou a cheap dollar as only another
form of the inflation heresies which they al
ways steadfastly opposed, and which in the
end would degrade the country. [Applause.]
They time and again denounced free trade,
pointing u> the ill-paid laborers of other coun
tries as conspicuons examples of the wrong
that would be inflicted by the introduction of
Buch an industrial system here. Shah we not
liccU their admonition*? [Criea of "Veal
The San Francisco Call
Uncle Samâ "Ha! ha! Well, I should smile!"
yes!"] We must hold fast to our present ex
cellent financial system which they helped to
establish, and we must restore that splendid
industrial policy which enabled this country
to rapidly, distinctively and undisputedly sur
pass all others. [Great applause.] This can be
done by an overwhelming Republican triumph
at the polls in November, now not six weeks
distant. [Great applause and cries of "It will
be done!"] Men of Oil City and Venango |
County, how will your ballots be cast? [Loud I
cries of "For McKiuley, protection and sound i
money!"]
I am proud that my ancestors came from the
State of "Pennsylvania. [Great cheering.] It
will give me sincere pleasure to meet and greet
all of my fellow-citizens who are assembled
about me, and I am sure it will give Mrs. Me-
Kmley great pleasure to meet the young ladles
who are the bearers of the beautiful flowers,
representing our glorious and unbroken
Union. [Great cheering.]
5 Major McKin ley's address in response
to the remarks of Colonel Huff, spokes
man of . the West Moreland County dele
gation, was as follows:
I thank you one and all for the good cheer
which you bring me to-day. In this contest
old party lines are being more or less effaced |
and patriotic' citizens are coming together i
upon one common/Platform to j sustain- the |
public honor and support . tbÂ« good faith of j
the Government of the United States. [Great
cheering.] This con t st lln seme of its aspects !
is the old yet ever new contest between the i
right and wrong. Standing for the right, as j
we believe, for can there be any doubt that
standing for National honor and National
credit and National currency and the suprem
acy of the law is standing for the right? Can
there be any doubt of that, my fellow-citizens
jof West Mortland County? [Cries of "No,
I never!"] Lincoln said, in one of those great
debates against Douglas: "It is a question
between right and wrong that is the real issue.
That is the issue that will continue in this
country when these poor tongues of ours are
1 silent.' it is the eternal struggle between these
two principles, right and wrong, throughout
the world. They are two principles that have
stood face to face from the beginning of time,
and will ever continue to struggle until the
right shall ultimately triumph."
The sublime principle for which Abraham
Lincoln contendedâ the limitation of slave
territory and the final abolition of slavery It
selfâdid triumph most gloriously, to the satis
faction -evidently, of every patriotic citizen
both North , and South. . We are confronted
this year with a question of not mere partisan
difference, but with a great moral principle.
What is the proposition gravely presented to
us? Both of the groat political parties of this
country have at different times, the Repub
lican and Democratic, in the most deliberate
and binding manner, placed upon the statute
books of the United States the expressed
declaration that "all our money, whether gold,
silver or paper, shall be kept equal in value by
every resort at the command of the Govern
ment." [Tremendous cheering.] ,
In opposition to this formal, legal and bind
ing declaration there are those who propose,
to deliberately annul that solemn contract â
by lawful means, it is tiae-but without pre
tense or intention to make good the loss it
j would tail, upon any citizen or provision
whatever for the great depreciation j it would
occasion to every holder -of our Government
securities or the just claims of our pensioners
and other honest creditors. \ The proposition
they make is to put this country upon a sole
monetary basis ' and* that monetary basis a
silver one. resting on a depreciated and depre
ciating coin, a coin fluctuating in value from
day to day. And what will be the result? It
will drive j from circulation or ) impair the
value of all the other money of the country,
for it must be remembered that the nations of
the world which are 'on a silver basis use no
gold and the nation's that are on a gold basis
use silver. [Applause.] If the: suggestion is
made that this course involves the good faith
and nonor of the Government . and would for
the first time cause a., partial repudiation of
our just obligations, the answer is made | that
our creditors should .expect nothing better,
and that they have aright to. expect- nothing
better. They have a right to expect nothing
of the sort from the Government of the United
States, that never repudiated a debt it made.
[Applause.] -' â  -: . â â¢ :i â¢ ; -
To my mind the.question involves.a distinct
issue between right and wrong, between honor
and dishonor ; and I believe it will â¢on reflec
tion be so considered by an .overwhelming ma
jority of American voters on the 3d of Novem
ber next. [Tremendous applause arid f cheer-
Ing.] We cannot afford to trifle : about a mat
ter bo serious and vital to our standing and
welfare as a people; and I appeal to you, fel
low-citizens of West Moreland County, and all
who love our country and our institutions to
rise in their might and defeat this unworthy
appeal : by such vast majority bs will put it
to rest forever. [Applause and cries of '-We
will."]
The first speech of the day was the
shortest. It was made in response to the
remarks of W. S. Van Dyke, who spoke
for a delegation of miners from West New
ton. Major McKinley devoted his re
marks mainly to. the tariff.

; CHICAGO, 111./ S"pt. 24.â While the

paigners as Payne, Durbin, Cummins and
Hahn that if the people went to the polls
to-day Mr. Bryan would be beaten by an
immense majority. These leaders talked
j to-day to a reporter for the United Asso
ciated Presses in a tone of supreme confi
dence and a 6 if a load of anxiety and doubt
had beeu lifted from their shoulders by
I tbe latest news from the field.
Acting Chairman Payne said: "We are
ready to go to tbe polls now p.nd we can
hold our own for the next six weeks. In
Wisconsin it is not considered respectable
any more to be a Bryan man. Mr. Bryan
has killed himself by talking.
"His talk has made tbe sensible and con
servative citizens afraid to vote for him,
although they may not like the Repub
lican platform. Tbe intelligent people
will no longer read tbe vaporings ot
Bryan. His party has gone to the dogs.
They are doing nothing to win votes or
keep them. We have men out whose buÂ«i
-nesÃ it is to report what the Democrats are
doing, and they cannot nnd anything but
masterly inactivity. I have just received
I the resuHof the second poll taKen by our
| agents in South Dakota. It shows the
â  Republican parly has gained over 6000 of
j the votes which were doubtful when tbe
I first poll was taken and that the Demo
i cratic vote has decreased in that time
j This is an indication of the general im
provement of tfce Western situation
within the last few weeks. A poll was re
cently taken in Winnebago County and it
showed 3000 plurality for McKinley, a big
increase over two years ago."
Major Hahn said: "There ha* been a
big change among the Western voters
within the last two weeks, more so within
the last week, and I am now firmly con
vinced that the result ,in November in
what are now considered doubtful States
will surprise our most sanguine party
leaders. My reports are only partly based
on information received from the 275 Na
tional Committee speakers now in the
field."
Senator Burrows - came in from Michi
gan, which tie declares with confidence
will give 50,000 plurality for McKinley.
Ex- Congressman Roswell G. Horr of
New York came in from an extensive
Western tour, and his only doubt is about
Kansas, which he admitted will be hard
fighting-ground to the end of the cam
paign.

will make two speeches each in lowa, Ne

CUDAHY GETTING A CORNER
Ho! da Twenty- Fire Million Bushel* of
December Wheat.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 24.â December
wheat began to take an upward turn on
the Chicago Board of Trade ' to-day, and j
John Cudahy, the credited holder of
nearly all of 'the contract wheat for De
cember delivery, .is reported to have a
deep-laid scheme to keep the stuff until
the dollar mark is reached. . He is said to
hold at least 25,000,000 bushels. . There
was a jump of 1% cents in the market to
day, from 65 to 66% cents, but later in the
session the price declined to 64% cents
and closed at 65% cents. The -. demand
from the short interest, however, con
tinued unabated to the tap of the gong.
The market was partly influenced by the j
cable quotations, recording higher prices
and steadily increasing demand. ! The cry
of short crops in Europe has been backed
up by higher prices there and messages
from Russia containing â  the word
"famine." Tien there is an unusually low,
aggregate in this country's yield. The j
well-informed â ' here believe Cudahy has I
utilized his recent good fortune to get a |
grip on December wheat which < comes !
dangerously near the "corner" line."
John R. Gentry, the Swiftest Pacer in the World, Who Lowered

ANDREWS' SWIFTEST DRIVE.
It Is Hard Work for the Running
Pacemaker to Keep Up With
the Great Pacer.
PORTLAND. Me., SfÂ»pt. 24.â T0-day
was an eventful day for Rigby, because
: tbe world's pacing record was broken by
| John R. Gentry, the magnificent horse
' pacing tbe fastest mile ever made in har-
I ness and placing the world's record at
i only half a second over two minutes, or
â  2:00%. Gentry was roundly applauded
: when he appeared on the track for tiis
i great trial of speed. The air was chilly
ard a light northwesterly breeze blew up
the homestretch. His record before
starting was 2:ol}Â£, which he made Sep
tember 8 at Glen Fails, N. V., in the sec
ond heat of a race with Star Pointer. An
drews had given Gentry two warming-up
miles, and it was nearly sunset when he
was ready to start for the eventful mile.
Andrews rode his sulky easily, with an
air of confidence, but among the specta
tors there were very few who believed that
the record would oe lowered so near the
twig-minute mark.
A runner appeared with Gentry, to pace
him. After scoring twice, Andrews came
; down to the wire to begin the fastest mile
j ever accomplished by a horse in harness.
! The crowd cheered as he approached the
startinc point.
"Go!" shouted Starter Culbertson, and
hundreds of watches caught the pacer at
the start. The runner's nose was within
two feet of Gentry's as they made the first
turn. In the stretch Gentry was going
gracefully and steadily, getting over the
ground in good shape, and the runner had
to work hard to keep up. The first quarter
was given by the judges as mace in '_'!â¢>;
seconds. People began to wonder when
the half-mile was finished in 59]4 seconds
I and to look for a two-rainnte pace. At
I this point the runner's driver was using
the whip and making a great effort, and
succeeded in keeping at the wheel of
Gentry's sulky.
The third quarter was reeled off in :309Â£.
making the time at the three-quarter post
I 1:30>4. This was great going, and now
' came the last quarter and homestretch.
', As the horses turned into the homestretch
I and caught the wind in their teeth the
crowd began to shout and hurrah, and
Andrews shouted encouragingly to his
horse. The runner's driver also urged his
horse and used the whip.
All this nerved the pacer to a supreme
effort and he made the last quarter quicker
than the third quarter, doing it in 30}^
seconds, thus covering his mile in 2:oo}Â£.
This was a whole second less than his
former record, which had never been sur
passed by any horse and only equalled by
Robert J (2:01}^), in 1895, at Terre Haute.
MILLIONS FOR CHARITY.
Most of Philanthropist Pratt** Eitat*
Left to Beneficent 2n*titutiont.
NEW YORK., N. V., Sept. 24.â Enoch
Pratt, the millionaire and philanthropist,
recently deceased, left $2,000,000 to chari
ties. The will waa filed for probate in the
Orphans' Court yesterday, and it is. esti
mated the estate is worth $3,000,000.
After bequests amounting to over half a
million dollars Mr. Pratt leavo? the resi
due of bis estate, upward of $2,000,000, to
the trustees of the Shepherd Asylum, with
the stipulation that the name be changed
to the Shepherd and Enoch Hospital.
Should the trustees fail to obtain an act
of the Legislature by which tbe charter of
the institution is so amended tbe residue
of tbe estate is to be equally divided
among the testator's six nieces and
nephews.
Mr. Pratt left to his wife $400,000 in
bonds and his city residence, the iatter, at
her death, to become a part of the residue
of the estate. The two statues, the "Shep
herd Boy" and "Uampaspe," by Bartholo
mew, are, after Mrs. Pratt's death, to go
to the Peabody in>titute.
Five thousand dollars is left in trust for
the Congregational church and society of

SMALL RIOT ON A RAILROAD.
Officers Guard the Switches in the Elk-
horn (Ntbr.) Yards to Prevent
Train- Wrecking.
CHADRON, Nebr., Sept. 24.â There was
a small riot on the Eikhorn Railroad at
this place last night. Half a dozen men
employed in the yards became intoxicated,
threatened the lives of local railroad of
ficials, and are reported to have attempted
to obtain control of the switches, intend
ing to derail incoming trains. City Mar
shal Morrissey patrolled in the yards on
re switch-engine all night, and was com
pelled to swear in eight or ten special po
licemen in order to maintain peace and
prevent the men doing damage to railroad
property. Those who nre known to have
taken part in tbe riot were discharged
from the railroad to-day. The matter is
being investigated, and it is believed sev
eral others will be discharged soon.
ONE HUNDRED MONKS MURDERED.
Many of the Victims of the Philippine Insur-
gents Tortured in a Horrible
Manner.
MADRID. Spain, Sept. 24.â A dispatch
to the Imparcial from Hongkong says
that steamers which have arrived there
from Manila, the capital of the Philippine
Island?, bring the announcement that
Cavite is occupied by 15,000 insurgents.
Nearly 100 monks have been murdered in
the islands since the breaking out of the
insurrection.
Many of the victims have been fastened
to trees, their clothing having been soaked
with oil and then ignited and burned to
death. Rich natives are being arrested
daily. Documents have been seized by
the authorities in which are given the
names of the president and various other
officials of the proposed republic.
ONE VESSEL FOR JAPAN,
The Union Iron Works to Get
Another Big Ship-Build-'
ing Contract
Plans Submitted by the Scotts Are
Superior to Those Prepared by
the Crimps.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 24.â The
Union Iron Works will get another big
ship-building contract. It is practically
settled that the Scotts will secure the con
tract for one of the new Japanese cruisers.
The two Japanese naval constructors who
have been in Washington for some time
past to examine plans and specifications
for the two new ships which the imperial
Government contemplates building have,
it is understood, approved the proposals
submitted by the Union Iron Works and
the Cramps of Philadelphia, and in their
report to the home Government recom
mend the construction of the two ships in
this country. The plans submitted by the
Pacific Coast firm were much more per
fect and in greater detail than those
offered by the Messrs. Cramps, and the
Japanese representatives now in the
city have inaue the Acceptance of the
bid of the latter firm contingent upon their
willingness to build the vessel upon tbe
plans submitted by the Union Iron Works
in case the contract is awarded them for
one of tbe new ships. The Cramps are
quite willing to do this, as they are anx
ious to get the contract for building one of
the vessels. The formal award of the con
tract will not be made until the Japanese
Naval Office has passed upon the report of
the Japanese naval constructors who wtre
sent to this country to examine plans and
secure bids. There is little doubt at the
Japanese legation, however, that their
recommendation will be adopted by the
home Government.
The cruisers will be of about 5000 tons
displacement, and will have a speed of
about 22 knots. They will be a little
smaller than the Oiympia, built by the
Union Iron Works, but will, be somewhat
on the lines of that ship.
Investigation of Missouri Railroad*.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept 24.â The Inter
state Commerce Commissioners and the
leading tariff officials of the Cbicaero-Mis
souri River lines left last evening for Kan
sas City, where the Interstate Commission
will start another investigation to-day
with a view of getting further informa
tion as regards alleged violations of the
interstate commerce law by the Missouri
River lines.
FIVE STRONG NOMINATIONS.
Able Men Put Up by the
Regular Republican
Party.
A. C WIDBER NAMED FOR
TREASURER.
Webster Selected for Superinten
dent of Schools After a
Close Contest.
HOW HORACE DAVIS REPUDIATED
THE TRAITORS.
George W. Elder Nominated for Superintendent of
Streets â The Platform Adopted by the Con
vention Willingly Indorsed by
Each Candidate.
For Treasurerâ A. C. Wldber. T
For Superintendent of Streetsâ George
W. Klder.
For City and County Attorney â John
R Aitken.
For Surveyorâ Charles S. Tilton.
lor Superintendent of Public Instruc
tionâReginald H. Webster.
Five nominations, as above, were made
by the regular Republican Convention of
the City and County of San Francisco at
the session held last night at the Audi
torium.
Interest and enthusiasm in the work ot
the convention of the regular Republican
GEORGE W. ELDER, Republican Nominee for Superintendent of
Streets*
party of the City and Connty of San Fran
cisco was largely augmented Jast night by
the news that spread like wildfire during
the afternoon, that Horace Davis bad re
pudiated the would-be betrayers of the
party, and had resigned as the nominee
for Mayor of the Kelly-Rainey combina
tion.
It' was even rumored last night that
Henry S. Martin, the nominee of the dis
ruptionists for Treasurer, was strongly
considering the advisability of following
the example of Mr. Davis. It is known
that he accented the nomination only on
tbe understanding that harmony was to
be restored in the ranks of the Republican
party of this City by the elimination of
tbe Rainey influence from the Kelly
faction.
As the situation now exists those Re
publicans who were deceived into lending
their prestige to the rule-or- ruin element
are fast deserting tha wrecked and fast
sinking craft which the professional deal
ere in pubiic offices and trusts are des
perately trying to keep afloat. Recent
developments have but too glaringly
shown the false pretenses under which
these individuals have been operating and
their utter and innate lack of power,
purity and patriotism.
That they are on their last legs is shown
by their desire, conveyed last night to the
Auditorium convention, to hold a con
ference with the regulars for the purpose
of being received into the true faith and
fold of Republicanism.
That the regulars, however, place
neither reliance on tbe protestations of
Martin Kelly that he desires to serve the
Republican party nor value on his ability
to aid in securing party success was em
phatically recorded Tvhen Chairman
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Riordan, in announcing the fact that over
tures for a conference had again been
made by the owners. and manipulators of
the B'nai B'ritb Hall assemblage, said
that he did not think the Republicans de
sired to have anything to do with traitors
and mischief-makers. Tne delegates bore
out his sentiment by entirely ignoring the
communication and proceeding with the
business of making nominations.
There was not even standing room in
either tbe auditorium or the galleries when
the delegates were requested to take their
seatsfbv Chairman Kioraan. Business waa
promptly taken up, and lor two hours the
proceedings held the audience with un
abated interest. There was eloquence and
entnusiasm without stint, and several very
exciting contests for the honor of receiy-
ing nominations at the hands of the con
vention.
A. C. Widlier was nominated by acclam
ation for the office of Treasurer, and
Charles S. Til ton received the same dis
tinction in connection with the Surveyor
ship.
i?or Superintendent of Streets there were
three candidatesâ Georgp W. Elder, George
P. Wetmore and Isaac P. Kincaid. After
the balloting had proceeced as far as the
Thirty-third District, Wetmore's name
was withdrawn, and Elder came out
triumphant with plenty of votes to spare.
For City and County Attorney John R.
Aitken and Ernest A. Wakeman were
placed in the race by their friends, and
the former proved the victor.
The most exciting contest arose over the
nomination for Superintendent of Pubho
Instruction. There were two exceedingly
popu'ar candidates for the honor â Regi
nald H Webster, the head of the mathe
matical department of the Polytechnic;
High School, and Madison Babcock, the
incumbent of the office. The ballot re
sulted in 130 votes for Webster and 112 for
Babcock. >
Several attempts were made early in the
proceedings by the "push" of tbe "'fakirs,"
who hold forth in B'nai B'rith Hall, to
create a disturbance, but they were
promptly taken care of and thereafter
held their peace. Tne business of the con
vention will be continued to-ni.'ht, when
among other things the committee ap
pointed last night to select candidates for
members of the Board of Education will
make its report.
THE PROCEEDINGS.
The Ticket Completed as Far as
the Superintendent of
Schools.
It was but a few minutes past 8 o'clock2
A. C WIDBER, Republican Nominee for Treasurer.
when Chairman Riordan called the dele
gates to order. On motion the reading of
the minutes of the previous night's ses
fcion was dispensed with.
O.i motion of Robert Ash it was decided
ttiat the chair appoint a committee of ten
to select suitable candidates for members
of the Board of Education, that the chair
man be made a member of this committee
and that the committee report to the con
vention to-day.
dominations for Treasurer were declared
in order, and John H. Durst took the
platform to nominate a candidate.
Dum was welcomed with applause.
He said that tjie man whom he would
name for Treasurer is one of whom the
party might be proud. The office is one
which must be rilled by a man of honesty
and integrity, and, above all, who pos
sesses thf confidence of the community.
The office was one of the most important
to be consideied by the convention. The
revenues of the County amount to be
tween $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 per annum.
The Treasurer must give a bond of $200,000.
It would naturally he supposed that only
a rich man can qualify for this office, but
this Is not so. The man he would name
had before qualified, and he had the con
fidence of the community. Mr. Durst
said that while the convention had gone
abroad lor nominees, he would now name
a native ton, the incumbent, A. C. Wid
ber. Mr. Durst dosed with a tribute to
Mr. Widber's acts in office, and said that
the result of November would ratify tiie
choice of the convention.
At the conclusion of Mr. Durst's nomi
nating speech Chairman Riordan said:
"I forgot to mention, in view of the fact
that many may not have read the evening
papers, that the Hon. Horace Davis, prob
ably recognizing toe fact that this is the
only Republican convention [Applause]
of the City and County of San Francisco,
sent his resignation to the so-called Re
publican convention created and operated
by Mahoney and Kelly in the interests of
the Democratic faction bossed by Sam
Kainey." [Applause.]
Frank H. Powers seconded the nomina
tion of Mr. Widber in a brief but effective
speech, saying that if Widber be placed
back again the public will have a man in
whom confidence may be placed. :
The nominations â were closed, and Mr.
â \Vidber took the stage and was applauded
vigorously. Chairman Riordan intro
duced him as the next City and County
Treasurer.
Mr. Widber spoke briefly, sayine sub
stantially as follows:
"I have read your platform. I indorse
it, and X will do the best I can to elect
your ticket. Should I be elected I will
try to conduct the oilke economically and
as in the pa.-;."
The nomination of Mj. Widber was then
made unanimous by acclamation.
When nominations for Superintendent
C S. TILTON, Republican Candidate for City and County Surveyor*
of Streets were declared in order, Martin
Stevens ascended the platform, and in the
firr-t lew words named his candidate. He
spulce as follows:
"Why should Georce W. Elder be elected
Superintendent of Streets?"
At this point some Mahoney heelers in
thu gallery attempted to create a disturb
ance, but were promptly suppressed.
"If for no other reason, then because he
has made enemies such as have just shown
tlieir enmity to him," continued Mr.
Stevens, "and the people love him for the
enemies he has made.
"Because with the blade of investigation
he smote the Democratic incumbent of the
office to_ which I have the honor of nomin
ating him from head to toe. Because, as
the expert of the Committee of S'.reets, of
which Supervisor Adolph Spreckels is
chairman, he succeeded in showing that
over $400,000 worth of rotten work had
been done, and in having it rejected.
"He is the friend of the property-owner,
and thb friend of the poor man, and he
comes here to pledge himself that there
will be no rotten work done while he is in
oflice."
Here the Mahoney-Kelly stuffers again
essayed to make an unseemly display of
themselves, but their efforts were as weak
and futile as those of their employers to
disrupt the Republican party. Paying not
the slightest heed to them, Mr. Stevens
continued as follows:
"If thieving contractors have placed
their hirelings here to-night, I say be
vare if Elder be elected 1 He has got them
on the run and he is going to keep them
rauaing.
"Mr. Elder has the support of all the
improvement clubs of the City and he has
the support of all the wheelmen. He is
in continual receipt of commendatory and
eulogistic communications for the good
work he has accomplished. The people
want this man, and the people demand
this man at the hands of this convention.
The people are at last receiving their
dues."
J. H. llarney of the Thirty-fourth As
sembly District seconded the nomination
of George W. Elder, saying that he is effi
cient, and that in him the public would
have an honest official.
W. H. Allen nominated "that genial
neighbor, tuat magnificent citizen," Isaac
P. Kincaid.
James A. Stevens seconded the nomina
tion of Kincaid.
Henry Jacob of the Thirty-eighth Dis
trict nominated George P. Wetmore. The
nomination was seconded from the floor
and the nominations were then closed.
George W. Elder took the stage and
said :
"I heartily indorse the platform and if
nominated by this convention I will do
the best I can to get elected, and if I do not
receive the nomination I will do the best
I can to secure the election of the nomi
nee."
Mr. Kincaid also addressed the conven
tion. He said that he had honestly sought
the nomination for this office. If nomi
nated and elected he would conduct the
affairs of the office so that no one would
regret the nomination. He approved of
the platform.
The ballot was then proceeded with and
resulted as follows: Elder 192, Kincaid
49. Wetmore's name was withdrawn after
tne ballot proceeded as far as the Thirty
third District.
On motion the nomination of George W.
Elder was made unanimous.
The nomination of City and County At
torney was then taken up.
Lincoln Savage nominated Judge John
R. Aitken. General Salomon seconded
the nomination of Aitken.
Frank H. Powers nominated Ernest A.
WaKeman. W. H. Schuler of the Forty
first District seconded the nomination of
Wateman.
The nominations were then closed.
Judge Aitken and Edgar L. Wakpman
both addressed the convention, indorsing
the platform and promising to give the
City good service if nominated and elected.
The roU was then called and resulted as
follows: Ait Ken 194, Wakeman 48. The
nomination oi Aitken was then made
unanimous.
The City and County Surveyor was next
nominated.
Maurice L. Asher of the Thirty-ninth
Assembly District named Charles S. Til
ton. Saniuel Guthrie of the Forty-first
District seconded the nomination of Til
ton. The nominations were then closed.
Mr. Tilton said: "I will make a very
short speech. I have read your platform
and indorse it."
Mr. Tilton got three cheers from the
delegates and was declared the unanimous
choice of the convention.
For Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion P. A. Bergerot of the Thirty-eighth
District named Reginald H. Webster,
principal of the mathematical department
of the Polytechnic High School.
Robert Ash named the incumbent, Su
perintendent Madison BabcocK, and Frank
H. Powers seconded the nomination.
Hugh W. Fraser of the Forty-third Dis
trict seconded tbe nomination of Webster.
Mr. Webster made a short speech, Bay
ing that hb had been a lifelong Repub
lican and promising to do his best for the
success of the ticket and indorsing the
platform.
Madison Babcock said be was glad to
get an opportunity to look the regular
Republican convention of San Francisco
in the face. He was glad to congratulate
the chairman upon presiding over the reg
ular Republican convention, and also
congratulated the convention on the plat
form, which he indorsed. This was the
only convention from which he bad sought
or expected a nomination. He would
stand or fall with the nominees of this
convention. HU record with the School
Department was an open book. He had
been devoted to tbe work And his ambi
tion was to keep the schools up to the
highest possible standard. He would
preserve that record if he should be

At this point Mr. Riordan made some
remarks in reference to the action of the

and desired to have a conference with this

which derives its. authority from the
County Committee. He did not, believe
that : any Congressional convention ever
had the : power to call . a municipal con

MR. SPRECKELS' POSITION.
Always Favored Harmony and Held
Out tho Olive Branch.
John D. Spreckels was seen yesterday by
a Call reporter and interviewed with
reference to the local political situation
and the rumors which have been flying
around for several days respecting a com
promise with the "Irregulars." In re
sponse to a question as to his personal
feelings upon the subject, Mr. Spreckels
said:
"I have been from the very beginning of
this campaign in favor of harmony within
the ranks of the Republican party, and 1
have at various times iield out the ciive
branch to those who lave been held re
sponsible for any discord which exists in
the local organization. I favored the
withdrawal of Mr. Montague from the
LORENZO A. HENRY, Republican Candidate for the Assembly
in the Forty-Second District.
electoral t'eket in the hone of ending the
dissensions among the Republicans of the
Fourth Congressional District, and I also
advised that Mr. O'Bnea be conceded the
nomination for Congress from that dis
trict with the same object in view.
"For the past several days I have been
repeatedly seen by certain of the leaders
of the 'Irregulars' and liHve at all times
declared it to be my earnest desire to har
monize the lochl party by any reasonable
concession to them. I believed and I now
believe that it was my duty as a member
of the National Republican Committee to
have our party present a united front to
the enemy in this campaign. I think,
however, that tbe only way to bring about
harmony within the puny is for all fac
tions to come together beneath the banner
of the regular and legal party organiza
tion. To attempt to harmonize conflicting
elements upon any other basis would, in
my judgment, result only in the disrup
tion and disorganization of the party. I
have, therefore, refuse-! to consider any
scheAe for promoting party harmony
which did not embrace the recognition of
the legality of the County Committee and
the regularity of the convention which it
has called.
"The Republicans of San Francisco
should consider that the convention now
in session at tbe Auditorium is by every
party usaee the regular Republican Con
vention of this Citj'. Its powers are de
rived by resular and orderly descent trom
the Republican party organization of the
last campaign. Nobody has ever ques
tioned the legality of the County Central
Committee which called it. Even the
irreeulars are compelled to concede that
the County Central Committee was the
only authorized and legal representative
of the local party at tlia beginning of the
campaign, because they trace their own
claim of title oacfc to it.
"The action of the St. Louis Convention
in issuing its credential? to Messrs. Spear
and Kowalsfcy could not interfere in any
way with the rights and powers of the
County Committee, ami the claims that
the National Convention did so interfere
is an absurdity. I have opposed and I
shall oppose every factional effort to di
vide the Republican party and destroy its
organization. I believe in party organi
zation. I tiiini that icyal submission to
it is the only way to win victories for the
party, and that every attempt to destroy
ft brings disaster and defeat.
"I am a tirm believer in the mainte-

Instruction.
nunce of party discipline as a requisite to
success; but I am an opponent of what is
known as bosses and bossism in politics.
I do not believe in encouraging men who
are in politics for what they can make out
of it, by giving them control of the organ
ization. I think tuat the only way to
avoid the control of sucn bosses is by ure
ing upon all good citizens that it is their
duty to engage in local politics, become
members of committees, take part in pri
maries, accent offices, and stand together
in the interests of honest politics.
"Holding these views, 1 have interested
myself actively in the politics of this City,
and both as a private citizen and as a
member of tbe National Committee of my
party I am working earnestly and ardu
ously for the selection of honest men for
the local offices and tha success of both
the local and National ticket in the com
ing election. lam aware that those who
are apparently more interested in discord
than in harmony within the Republican
party bave endeavored to misrepresent
my views and my position upon these
subjects, but I do not intend that such
efforts shall meet with success. Neither
do I believe that the honest Republicans
of this City will be misled by the asser
tions of persons and of newspapers who
would rejoice in our party's defeat."
The Forty-Second's Choice.
Lorenzo Henry, the Republican nomi
nee of the Forty-second Assembly Dis
trict for the Assembly, is a young man
who commands influence in
his district. A better man could hardly
be chosen for the position, for Mr. Henry
has a good, clean record that must appeal
to all citizens desiring honest government.
That nis candidacy will appeal to the
workingmen of his district \% a settled fact
because Mr. Henry understands the d ig
nity of Jabor and has been prominently
identified with trades unionism ever since
he was able to work for himself.
He was born in Sun Francisco thirty
seven years ago and has lived in the
Forty-second District about twenty-five
years and aiways taken an active part in
Republican politics there for the past
seventeen years. At present he is secre
tary of District Club No. 2. ol which T. P.
Riordan, chairman of the Regular Re.
publican Convention, is president.
Mr. Henry is foreman of the pressroom
of George Spaulding & Co.'s printing
establishment and a cnarter member of
Pressmen's Union No. 24, which was or
canized over a decade aeo.

SAX FRANCISCO, Sept. 34, 1896.
H. P. SONNTAG ESQ., Chairman of
Convention â My Dear Sir: Yo& will re
meinbor that in our conversation re
garding the Republican nomination for
Mayor I said I should be glad to run if
I could unite the two wings so that
locally we could present a solid front
for the great National issue in No
vember.
It is very evident from the events of
last evening that this cannot be done,
and it only remains for me to decline
the nomination; and in doing so I ask
you to thank your friends for their
generous confidence In me.
Regretting the continuance of this un
happy quarrel. I remain, with great re
spect, yours very truly,

Micawber Mahoney, crawled out from un
der the ruins in a very limp and utterly
demoralized condition.
Nobody would attend their show.
Horace Davis refused to occupy the
Mayor's box, although he bad received a
complimentary ticket, and no one else
would accept a second-hand ticket, so that
there was no one of respectability who
cared to run the risk attendant upon be
ing found among the seedy and office
hungry patrons of the variety 10-cent
show.
It was of no use to continue nominating
people who would not accept office at the
hands of the fakirs. The prospective can
didates probably had in their mind's eye
the Webbter Dictionary definition:

People did not want to have their politi
cal fortunes told by the B'nai B'rith Hall
aggregation . of misfit talent out of a job,
and that is why the hall was as gloomy as
a morgue last night. .

The "push" did not look very pushing
last night. They wore crape on their faces

The declination of Horace Davis was
supplemented by a request from Major
McLauchiin, chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, that Mr. Kelly
i should not make any nominations, but
1 that he should adjourn and call upon the
major at 11 o'clock this morning and ex
plain, ii ; he could, whether he was politi
cal! alive, and if so, why ?
The major did not couch his request in
those words, but the crowd acted as
though he had, and they came off the

acted any business whatever. *

Ban Francisco, Sept. 24. 1896. J
Hon. Thomas D. Riordan, Chairman, Cityâ My
DhAR Sir: The following is a copy of a letter
which I have just received:
Hon. Frank McZantghlin, Chairman . Republican
State Committeeâ l>kak sir: We are in receipt of
your courteous communication requesting that i tie
Republican Municipal Convention, presided over
by me, appoint representatives to confer with you
as chairman of the Republican State committee
to-morrow (Friday) morning at 11 o'clock In the
Interest of Republican union and success and with
a view to securing harmony and unity in the ranks
ot the Republican party In San Francisco: and to
that end further supermini: that we defer other
action by our convention and adjourn our meeting
this evening without making other nominations.
We are, as we always have been, so desirous of
the success of the National Republican ticket and
our party principles Involved in this campaign
that we cheerfully accede to your request. We
beg to present to you our assurance t nut our con
vention will adjonrn this evening without further
action or : nomination and that representatives
will be named, as requested, to meet you at the
hour by you designated and above named. Very
respectfully, Uxnby Jr. Sonxtaq, Chairman.-
--I ask your careful consideration of Mr. Soon
tag's letter and request that the convention
over which you have the honor to preside will
also adjourn temporarily until such time as I
can have a conference with the representa
tives of both conventions.
I urge that this action be taken In the inter
est of harmony and the consequent success of
our party." Very respectfully,
* Frank Mclaughlin, Chairman.
This is how the wake was announced :
Very promptly Chairman Sonntag ap
peared upon the platform, but before he
bad rapped ' the push to order, Mr. Kuef
had a conversation with Mr. Sonntag as
follows:
; "You will say," said Ruef, "the next or
der of business will be the nomination of
a Superintendent of Schools. Then I will
get up beforo anybody else can say any
thing.":-
-> "All right," assented Chairman Sonn
tag. :^RMiPPii'
"The secretary will please call the roll,"
said Mr. Sonntag.
Colonel Kowalsky caught the cue and
was on his feet in a moment to move that
roll-call be dispensed with,' and it was so
ordered. . ;
"1 move that the nomination for Super
intendent of Schools be postponed," said
Ruef.
Then he went on the platform and made
a statement to tbe effect that as he and
Mr. Kelly and the rest were desirous of
harmony it would be better to act upon
Major McLaughlin's suggestion that no
business be done.
A delegate announced that Sig. M. Bett
man bad been nominated for the Assem
bly by the Fortieth District convention.
Thc-n Chairman Sonntag announced that
he would appoint Messrs. Mahoney, Ruef
and Kelly as a committee to confer with
Major McLsughlin at 11 o'clock to-day,
ana the wake adjourned until Monday
night at 8 o'clock.
The corpse has been placed on ice and
will keep until then.
Major McLam>hlin was asked by a Call
reporter shortly after the lachrymose in
cident in B'nai B'rith Hall whether he
had received a petition from merchants or
other persons calling upon the State Cen
tral Committee to step in and restore har
mony to M/. Kelly's bosom.
''I have received no petition from the
merchants to i whom you refer," he re
plied. There was a tinge of Litterness in
the emphasis which he laid o* the word
"merchants."/, s \
-. â¢'There is a class of citizens here," he
continued, "who have waited until this
silver fever has died out and the tide has
turned, and then they come in at the tail
end and organize merchants' leaguis, and
divert money from the Republican Slate
Central Committee, when we are sortly in
need of funds to carry on this campion.
- "I want to say a word with reference, to
a report which I heard, that John D.
Spreckels is influencing or has influenced
me or this committee. I have fonnd M\
Spreckels to be as square and as honest &
man as I ever met in my life. He has no
selfish motive in being in politics. He is
politically pure; in fact, too pure to be a
politician." : ' \_ .' â <
With reference to the power of the State
Central ' Committee to settle disputes
within the party, Major McLaughlin re
called the action of the committee in the
Higgins and Chute contention many years
ago. In that matter the committee ap
pointed a convention of 150, which con
vention put up a ticket.
"It seems to me," he added, "that
when we see the party being torn to pieces
we should call a halt.and do all we can to
straighten them out. I don't believe it is
the policy of the -Republican party to al
low a tew disgruntled politicians to split
themselves into two bodies and call them
selves the chosen representatives of the
entire party. All good citizens are crying
'Shame' -because of this condition of
things, and are demanding that this com
mittee step in and straighten out iht
trouble, but it doesn't require any letters
from business men or sound-money leagues
to teach me what is my plain duty.
"As a matter of fact I have been work
ing about a month to bring those people
together and evolve order out of chaos,
but. thus far ray., most strenuous efforts
have failed. This afternoon I addressed a
communication to Mr. Bonntag asking
him to adjourn his convention and to
meet me here to-morrow morning at 11
o'clock. I addressed a similar letter to
Mr. Riordan, chairman of the Auditorium
convention, to which '. I have not received
any reply. I understand that that con
vention is going ahead with the regular
business.
â 'I believe that the people are stronger
than all the politicians and all the leaders
that were ever created, and when the
people rise in their might the politicians
will be swept away."
Major McLaughlin went on to say that
the position of chairman of the executive
committee was forced upon him, and that
he had devoted his whole time to the dis
charge of his duties.
"I can say without egotism that the ex
traordinary change in the sentiment of
this State that has taken place in the last
six weeks on the National issues is entirely
due to the work of the committee. Old
and respected , leaders of the party, who
have visited these headquarters, particu
larly during the last few days, have ad
mitted first, that they . were totally un
aware of the work that had been carried
on, and secondly, that better work has
been done than by any State Central Com
mittee in previous campaigns. Take the
mere matter of speeches alone.
"In 1894, with six candidates in the field :
outside of the City and County of San
Francisco on the 23d day of September
twenty-three speeches had been made in
the State, whereas on the same date this
year more than 230 apeeches had been
delivered, and more ' than 400 clubs were
in active existence, and every county in
the State was in thorough accord with the
committee. *
"Speaking of counties, look at Mariposa.
For the first time in eighteen years that
county has a Republican County Commit
tee, and the Republicans there "have j con
verted an almost hopelessly Bryan county
into a strong McKiiiley county.
"I notice in the evening papers that cer
tain parties are preparing a communica
tion to this committee asking it to take
such steps as will unite the different divi
sions of the party in this City. This is
about what my past experience warrants
me in expecting.
"Just as soon as a step is taken by an
authorized ' body that looks as though it
would be successful, there are those who
are eager to rush in and boldly suggest
just what they probably know is being
done. As a matter of fact, I have been at
work for weeks trying to restore harmony.
Very few of those gentlemen so prolific in
suggestions realize what a difficult task
it is to get together two large and inde
pendent political bodies, both eager for

NOT ALL FOR SILVER
One of Ihree Utah Conventions Declares
for McK.lulej/.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Sept. 24.â Three
State conventions, two Republican and
one Democratic, were held in this State
to-day.
The latter was held in the city of Provo
and was attended by a full representation
of delegates. After adopting resolutions
declaring for the free and unlimited coin
age of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 with gold,
without regard to other nations, a tariff
for revenue only and the opening of the
Indian reservations to settlement, the
convention nominated three Presidential
electors pledged to Bryan and Sewall.
These consisted of R. C. Lund, Democrat ;
J. J. Daly, Republican, and Henry W.
Lawrence, Populist.
Judge W. H. King, Democrat, was nom*
mated for Congress. The Independent
Republicans held their convention in this
city, and adopted a platform favoring free
coinage of silver, independent of tbe
actions of other nations, protection and
reciprocity. The convention, by acclam
ation, indorsed the Presidential electors
nominated by the Democratic convention.
A fight then occurred as to whether
the convention should nominate a
candidate for Congress or adjourn
until Saturday, when another branch
of the Republican party will meet
in convention at Ogden. the ob
ject of adjourning being, if possible, to
effect a compromise between the two fac
tions on a Congressional candidate.
After a long and acrimonious debate tbe
proposition to adjourn was defeated by a
large majority and the convention nomi
nated Lafayette Holbrook, a compara
tively unknown indivadual, as candidate
for Congress.
The other Republican convention was
hold at Mount Pleasant and was composed
of that section of the party which favors
the election of McKinley and Hobart.

Senatorial Convention will both meet here
next Saturday and the ticket will then be
completed. The attempt of the Populists
and Democrats to fuse on the county
ticket has failed thus far, which practi
cally insures.tbe success of the Republican
ticket here in November.
PROHIBITIONISTS VERY MAD.
I'opul i its, Democrat* and. Silverites Hog
the Office* in Pierce County.
TACOMA, Wash., Sept. Populists,
Democrats and Silver Republicans com
pleted fusion county tickets to-day after
three days' work. When the conference
committees met each ' party wanted : a
majority of offices. The Populists forced
other elements to recede and . captured a
majority of * both county and . legislative
offices." To comply with the law the' joint
product will be called the People's party
ticket, insuring the loss of hundreds of
Democratic votes. The feature of the con
vention was the admission of national
Pronibitionists to joint conference and
awarding two offices to them. After the
other parties had made their nominations
so many office-sreekers were disappointed
i tliat, the'PrpbiDitionists^were thrown over
board, and the offices allotted them di

the county and are very mad.
TALKS McKINLEY IS SPANISH.
Ex-Governor Pacheco Addresses a Crowd
at Sin Luis Ohispo.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Sept 24.â
Ex-Goveruor Romualdo Pacheco arrived
yesterday from the South and was ten
dered a reception at the Raiona Hotel.
"?o-night there was a big reception in his
honor.
â  There was a large procession headed by
Grand Marshal Blake and B. Munoz, his
aid. First came the artillery bund fol
lowed by McKiniey and Hobart clubs and
the M^Kinley uniformed guards, seventy
five stiong. It was a grand torchlight
affair. - A.H the way from the Republican
headquarters to the pavilion there was a
constant display of Roman 'candles and
rockets. The pavilion was decorated for
the occasion.
Pedro QUntana, president of the even
ing, introduced Pacbeco to the audience.
The stage wa< filled with vice-presidents,
both Americai and Spanish. After a few
remarks in English .-;. Pacheco ; spoke
Spanish, whichcharmed the ; Spanish part
of the audience greatly, doing considerable
good in this sec.ion. To-morrow he goes
to Pozo, where he .will speak in the even-
UK.
A railroad men's sound-money club has
been organized In the city, witn fourteen
members, who guarantee a roll of forty at
the next meeting. Officers: B. F. Whit
mer, president; W. B. Keliey. vice-presi
dent; H. E. Wetzel. secretary-treasurer.
LOUD AND FREEPS.
They Open a Campaign at Redwood City
to a Great Crowd.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Sept. 24.-The
Republican campaign was opened in Red
wood City to-night by Congressman E. F.
Loud and Hon. Timothy Guy Phelps.
The hall was packed, nearly hah of the
audience being ladies. There was a large
attendance from Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
and other neighboring villages. Mies
Fairchild opened the programme with a
song, which was encored.
Hon. George C. Ross presided. In intro
ducing Mr. Loud he referred to the fact
that the Southern States were always
more influential in Congress than the
North, and believed that it was due to
not changing their representatives as
often as did the North.
He devoted much time to a discussion of
the money questions.
Timothy Guy Pnelps closely held the
audience for nearly an hour in an able ex
position of the doctrine of protection.
He referred particularly to Japan as an
illustration. He said that last year our
imports from that country were $25,000,
-000, and our exports but $4,000,000, which
necessitated an export of $21,000,000 in
gold to make up the balance of trade. In
our trade with the world the balance of
trade against us was $269,000,000, just
about what Carlisle bad to borrow.

But the Boy Orator Fina'ly Makes a
Speech Between the Inter
ruptions.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Sept 24.âCandi
date Bryan will probably long remember
his reception to-day by the students of
Yale College. The Democratic standard
bearer addressed a big open-air meeting,
which nearly ended in confusion. As it
was, Mr. Bry.an gave tip attempting to
speak and retired in disgust.
The movements of the students were
presumably preconcerted. They were dis
tributed through tbe crowd and seemed to
sing and yell at given signals. When Mr.
Bryan began his speech, there was a cheer
and chorus from the students of "Bab,
rah, rah, Yale." He tried to go on, but
the yells made him stop again. A song,
with the refrain "Gold, gold, gold," kept
his words from being heard.
Finaily the candidate sat down, ana Mr.
Sargent, the Democratic candidate for
Governor, Alexander Troup, chairman of
the State Central Committee, ani Dr.
Fuller, the Democratic candidate for Con
gress in this district, made appeals for
order. Their efforts were successful after
Mr. Bryan had been seated ten minutes,
and at 2:50 he resumed hi? remarks. But
the d risive yells broke forth again, and
fifteen minutes later the candidate
brought his remarks to a close.
Mr. Bryan spoke from a stand on the
Bouth side of Center Church and when he
entered on "the green" between 12,000
and 15,000 persons were gathered there.
Mr. Bennett, who is chairman of the
town committee, presented Mr. Bryan,
and as the candidate rose the cheering
was interrupted by hisses and yells from
the Yale men. The appeals from Mr.
Troup and the others had a temporary
effect only. All through his remarks the
yells continued and Mr. Bryan cut his
speech short. Altogether he did not
.speak more than twenty minutes.
As soon as he concluded A. S. Crandall
of Norwich, candidate for Lieutenant-Gov
ernor. stepped forward and sharply criti
cized the Yale men. He proposed three
cheers for Mr. Bryan and they were given,
but mingled with hisses from the Yale
contingent.
Ex-Mayor Sargent then declared the
meeting adjourned and Mr. Bryan was
taken to the New Haven House in his car
riage. He looked very much fatigued and
refused to shak" hands as he "left the
stage. Tuis is Mr. Bryan's interrupted
apeec:i :
Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad there are
students here becau-e I want to say a word to
students. Your college has helped to add
fame 10 your city, and those who assemble
here are supposed to come In order that they
might better acquit themselves of the duty of
life. lam glad to talk to you students because,
my friends, we have a cause which appeals to
student!). If the syndicates and corporations
rue this country, then no young man has a
fair show unless he is the favorite of a corpor
ation. [Cheers and .yells for McKinleyfrom
the students.] If the people have a right to
govern themselves and deputize that right,
then every citizen has a fair show and every
man may achieve what he desires. We desire
to leave all the avenues open so that the son
of the humblest citizen may aspire to the
highest position within the gift of the people.
[Cheers and yells repeatedly.] I am not
speaking now to the sons who are sent to col
lege on the proceeds of ill-gotten gains.
[Great Cheering.] I will wait until these sons
have exhausted what their fathers have left;
then I will appeal to their children, who will
have to commence lite where their grand
fathers commenced. [Great cheering.]
My friends, a just Government is best for the
great mass of the people. Equal laws and
equal opportunities are best for 99 out of
every 100 of our citizens [yells again re
peated], and therefore our cause appeals to
every young man who wants to make this
Government so good as to deserve the love,
confidence and tne support of every citizen in
the land. We appeal not only to the students,
we appeal to business men who have been ter
rorized by the financial â what may I call It?
[applause] people who have been tyrannized
over by financial institutions until in some in
stances it is more dangerous to raise your voice
against the ruling power than it is in an abso
lute monarchy to criticize the Government.
[Applause and yells repeated.] If there is any
body who loves thai sort of condition then I
shall offend him by speaking of it, but I shall
not offend any man who loves liberty and
right of free speech in this country. [Great
applause-]
The business men have been told that the
free coinage of silver would ruin them. If it
can ruin them with more rapidity than the
gold standard has ruined them, then, my
friends, it will be bad Indeed, because the gold
standard hÂ»s increased the number of failures
among business men and every step that has
been taken has been followed by disaster. [Yells
from the students.] I have been so used to talk
ing to young men who earn their own living
that Ido not knowâ [Great cheering.] I say I
have been so used to talking to young men who
earn their own living thatibardly know what
language to use to address myself to those
who don't desire to be known as creators of
wealth, but who are the distributors of wealth
which somebody else created. [Great cheer
ing.] If you will show roe a young man who
has been taught to believeâ [More yells and
cries for McKinley.] In my travels I have not
found a crowd that needed talking to so much
as this crowd does. [Cries of "Tiiat's right."]
1 came to this city something more than a
year ago and 1 learned something of the domi
nation of your financial classes. I have seen
it elsewhere, but, my friends,: the great mass
of the people even of this city will be better
off under bimetallism, that permits the Nation
to grow, than under ii gold standard, which
starves everybody except the money-changer
and the money-owner. We eometimes out
West are instructed by your Insurance com
panies. I carry insurance ;in oid-line com
panies and in what are known a* the mutual
and assessment companies.: 1 carry insurance
in fraternal orders likÂ« the United Workmen
and Modern Woodmen [applause], as well as
in the old-line companies.and I am grateful
that ray assessment companies are satisfied to
take my money and give me insurance with
out attempting to tell me how I must vote.
Your old-line companies have seen fit to insult
the "intelligence of the people by attempting to
exerciser guardian care, while we are a Die to
look after ourselves without their instructions.
You ha vi. laboring men also in large numbers
* V!?ifo%now whether the advocates of the
-.old standard who employ men in shops in
slsi on telling their cmoloyes how to vote. I
have^n other places found employers who put
in envelopes the pay for the day's work or
Â«,l? work and then put on the outside of
The f envelopes Home instructions . to the em-
me" If the manufacturer, if the employer
ft the railroad president feels as if there must
IViome thing on the outside of the envelope
as on the inside let me suggest some
thing which .tne employer might pu .there.
Let him write on the outside: "You will niu!
within yonr wases. They are to - cover your
work; they are not to pay ior your vote.' â 
[Cries â¢of "Good,- good 1"] We recognise that
the men who have sense enough to do the
work we want done have sense enough to vote
right without our telling them bow to vote.

bond-buyer does nov write in his application
that he has a personal interest in the gold
standard ?
Why is it that these men want to throw
upon the wage-earner whatever odium there
may be in using his vote to protect his per
sonal interest? I believe the wage-earner and
the farmer and the business man and the pro
fessional manâ all of theseâ will be beneiited
by a volume of money sufficient to do business
with. m
If you make money scarce you make money
dear. If you make money dear you drive
down the value of everything; when you have
falling prices you have hard times. And who
prospers by hard times? There are but lew,
and these few are not willing to admit that
they get any benefit from hard times. No
party ever declared in its platform that it
was in favor of hard times, and yet the
party that declares for a gold standard in sub
stance declares for a continuance of hard
times. [Here the bund accompanying the First
Regiment of tbe National Guard of Connecti
cut, which had beiMi playing on the east side
of the common, marched westward and very
much nearer to the stand where Mr. Bryan
was speaking, so that it was impossible to hear
him more than a few feet away from the front
of the platform. The students, however, were
not making us much disturbance as they had
b.^en formerly.] It is hard enough to talk
when all the conditions are favorable, and I
must ask you to excuse me from talking any
further in the presence of the noises against
which we have had to combat to-day.
HARTFORD, Cojjn., Sept. 24.â Mr.
Bryan ended his Connecticut tour to-night
by making two speeches in Hartford. Both
meetings were held in the open air, the
first in Capitol Park and the other on Main
street, in front of the City Hotel.
When Mr. Bryan reached Hartford he
found a great throng at the station and
received many cheers. His carriage was
followed to the Heubleu Hotel by a crowd
of men and boys, many of tnern bearing
flaming candles of red Greek light. At 8
o'clock he went to Capitol Park, being ac
companied by another Greek fire escort
and the members of the iocal reception
committee in carriages. The gathering in
the park was extrtmely large.
Around the speaking-*tand, erected a
hundred feet from the Capitol building,
people were massed and numbered in the
neighborhood of 12,000, perhaps more.
Mr. Bryan stood upon a table on the stand
in order that the crowd might see him
better. The formality of an introduction
was dispensed with and the candidate
started to talk as soon as the cheering
which marked his aopearance was over.
Th- Capitol Park meeting concluded
Mr. Bryan was taken to the City Hotel,
where he found another big assemblage,
but smaller, however, than the other. He
spoke from tbe portico over the main en
trance to the hotel.
During the speech from tbe portico of
the City Hotel Mr. Bryan was hissed by a
segment of his audience.
OPINION OF THE BANKERS.
Democrat* Do Sotne fall* Figuring in
â¢ Regard to Bryan.
CHICAGO, 111., Kept. 24â Campaign
Commitieeman J. D. Johnson has received
at Democratic National headquarters from
a country banker in Illinois a copy ot a
letter sent out by N. W. Harris & Co., the
investment and bond: brokerage firm of
Chicago and Boston, to its correspondents
in that Stater The letter gives the result
of a canvass in Illinois. In the first place,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1896.
the firm sent inquiries to 4000 correspon*
dents, and it received abou: 1200 answers.
The letter giving this result states:
"There were 117 bank cashiers who re
ported that, in their opinion, from present
indications, the Democrats vote in their
county next November would be less than
it was in 1894, and tnat the free-silver ten
dencies were on the decrease.
There were thirty-six bank cashiers who
reported that in their opinion there would
be an increase in the Democratic vote in
November as compared with the Demo
cratic vote in 1894, and thirty of the bank
officials were of the opinion there would
be no change. In Minnesota the firm
j sent out about 4000 inquiries to its corre
spondents and received aDout 400 replies,
which were of the same tenor as those re
ceived from Illinois.
Mr. Johnson remarked that the Minne
sota correspondents evidently forgot the
Populist party in their estimates, as they
say nothing of the 80,000 Populist votes
cast in 1594 and nothing about* the Repub
lican silver defection led by John A. Lind
and Congressman Towne.
He added : "These correspondents are in
every instance men engaged in the bank
ing or investment businessâ a class which
is hostile to Mr. Bryan. Unreliable as the
information is. it shows thru even from a
banker's standpoint the silver movement
is lifcely to carry the entire West."
Senator Teller, who is in Oliio this week,
will arrive in Chicago Sunday to fill speak
ing engagements that are being made for
him in Illinois and adjoining States. The
reports to headquarters are that Kentucky
is full of Republicans who are coming into
the Bryan camp.
RAILRO AD TO BE SOLD.
Chicago and Xort hern Pacific Will Go to

CHICAGO, 111.. Sept 24.â Dispatches
from Milwaukee say that the troubles be
tween the Northern Pacific, the Wisconsin
Central and the Chicago and Northern Pa
cific have been amicably settled. The last
named road will be sold at auction in this

The purchaser, in addition, assumes two
mortgages, one to tbe city of Chicago for
$650,000 ana the other to E. A. Abbott and
John A. Stewart for $394,000, together with
minor obligations. The sale will take
place from the steps of tho Cook County
Courthouse at such a time as Bishop may
appoint.

FIVE MURDERED AT ONCE
A Negro Youth Kills a Whole
Family With a Pistol
and an Ax.
He Is Bung Huntid by Bloodhounds
and Will Probab y Be Lynched
if Cusht.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Sept. 24.â One of
the most heinous murders in the history
of this State was committed by a negro
boy named John Johnson in a farmhouse
four miles south of Independence at an
early hour yesterday. Joe Cotton, his j
wife, her brother and two sisters were S
killed, the first by a pistol shot and tbe
other four with an ax.
When an officer called at the house he
found Cotton stretched dead on the floor.
His head was blackened with powder,
showing that a pistol had been held near
the face when the fatal shot was fired.
The weapon was an old-fashioned cap and
ball, single-shot pistol and it bad been
loaded with slugs.
Martin Miller, Mrs. Cotton's brother,
was lying on his back across the bed, his
head almost severed from his body, evi
dently by a blow from an ax. In the bed
to the right of the door leading to the
front room, struggling in the last asony of
death, lay Miss Agnes Miiler, a sister-in
law, with a gash rive inches long over her
left eye, leaving the brain exposed. She
was conscious, but could not speak a word.
Just across the room, in another bed,
was Miss Lizzie Miller, her sister, with her
skull smashed la and a gash four inches
long in her bead, made with an ax. She
will die. In another corner was the muti
lated body of Mrs. Joe Cotton, her feet
under a table and her head near a chair,
with which she is supposed to have tried
to protect herself against her assailant.
The fiend who committed this quintuple
murder is a n^gro boy, who has been in
the employ of Cotton since April 3. He
was allowed to sleep in the same honse.
The motive is a mystery, as no attempt at
rob-bery had been made.
The only member of the family who es
caped was little Maud Miller, 14 years old.
She darted from the house and gave the
alarm. She says she saw Johnson begin
the butchery and strike tier mother with
the ax. The murderer is still at lar^e and
is being tracked with bloodhounds by a
mob. He will probably be lynched if
caught.
Their Fatal Quarrel.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 24.â Harry Con
way of Clinton, lowa, was killed this
afternoon by Grace Clark, who shot him
first and then killed herself. Conwav was
a brakeman on the Northwestern Rail
road, and came to Chicago last July with
tbe Clark woman. They had numerous
quarrels. The disagreement which caused
the shootin â¢ was over a letter from a
woman of Fall City, Nebr., written to
Conway.
WRECKED BY A WATERSPOUT.
Roared Like a Train and Destroyed
/Imilf and Fi*'.d*.
PATCHOGUE, L. 1., Sept. 24.â A fierce
whirlwind and waterspout swept through
the south bay for several miles Tuesday
ni ht. It serraed to descend from the
heavens until it reached the surface of the
bay, where it started whirling eastward
with the ronr of a hundred freight trains.
The spout was noticed first i'own toward
Fire Island. It swept east at a fearful
rate. When opposite Bay Port it struck
the yaciit of Harry C. Miller, turning her
bottom-side up in an instant. Tnen the
great, roaring body of water veered in its
course and went whirling away in a differ
ent direction. .
Only for this sudden chan-e the spout
would have wrecked hundreds of boats
that were lying at anchor all the way
from Bayville to East Patchogue. When
the spout reached a point off Patchogue it
started toward the main shore.
Sand was hurled in the air, and where
tnere were only three feet of water there
are vow six or seven. The waterspout
finally started norm and ran ashore op
posite East Patchogue. After it struck
the earth there was a whirlwind formed
instantly. This overturned bathing
houses, tore up trees and finally played
havoc in a bie corn ti Id.

the death to-day in tlie City of Mexico of
General Mexia, chairman of "the Ways and

EARTHQUAKE IN HAWAII,
Volcano Sparks Spouted High in
â¢ Air by the Shock in
Kilauea.
Earth Cracked for Half a MileâHono
lulu Bishop Thinks Monarchy
Is Yet Alive.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Sept. 17- â A
severe earthquake shock was experienced
in Hilo at 5 o'clock a. m. September 13.
In the center of the city a crack opened
from the sea half a mile inland and re
mained an inch in width. Most of the
bottles in a drugstore were broken. The
houses all being of wood were uninjured.
No such shock has been felt since the Kau
mnd flow of 1868.
The disturbance seemed to come from
the northeast. The same shock in a light
form awoke everybody in Honolulu that
morning.
At Ki'.auea the shock was much lighter
than at Hilo. The fire fountains in the
pit are increasingly active.
Great pleasure is felt in Honolulu at the
discovery of Kate Field's will. There
beine no proper facilities here for crema
tion the remains will probably be trans
ported to the Onited States.
The wreckers of the bark Gainsborough
are sanguine of floating the hull after
more coal is removed. The water in the
hull yields well to pumping.
The Arv-'lican Bis op Willis, in the Dio
cesan Magazine, expresses his belief "that
neither tranquillity at home nor respect
abroad nor commercial prosperity will be
restored until the monarchy is reinstated."
He thinks the monarchy is not "dead and
rotten." as alleged, but very much alive.
The Bishop evidently places a high value
on tbe recent Kaiulani boom.
Referring to tbe Bishop's remark about
commercial prosperity a prominent busi
ness man points to the fact that three
times as many new stores have been
erected in 1896 as in any previous year,
and four times as many new dwellings.
Nothing like the present growth of Hono
lulu has ever been witnessed.
President Dole will leave to-morrow for
a few weeks' rustication on Hawaii.

England Trying to Make Out a Case
Against the Prisoner.
LONDON, Eng., Sept. 24-Edward J.
Ivory, alias Edward Bell, the alleged
dynamiter who was arrested in Glasgow
on September 12, wns arraigned in the
Bow-street Police Court this morning.
The prosecution was conducted by Mr.
Gill, who appeared on behalf of the Treas
ury Department. Mr. Gill, in opening the
rase, said that the four alleged dynamiters.
Ivory, Tynan, Haynes and Kearney, the
first named arrested in Glasgow, the sec
ond in Boulogne, France, and the last two
in Rotterdam, left New York in August
last by different steamers and traveled
under false names. The men, he said,
were sent to Europe Dy the Fenian organi
zation in New Yorfc, which provided them
with funds, for the purpose of carrying
out the following scheme:
They were to proceed separately and by
different routes to Antwerp, where they
were to hire premises in which to prepare
chemicals for the manufacture of bomb 3
and dynamite cartridges. This done, they
were to find persons in London and Glas
gow to commit the actual crimes through
the use oi bombs which had been prepared
in Antwerp. It had been arranged in New
York before the four men started, Mr.
Gill said, that outrages should be commit
ted in the United Kingdom, and the men
expected that their work of preparing tho
bombs would be completed by Septem
ber 15.
Mr. Gill said that Ivory's mission was
to secure men to use the .bombs which the
others had prepared in Antwerp. The
hearing was adjourned until to-morrow.
It is announced upon official authority
that the Government has abandoned the
idea of atking for the extradition of the
alleged dynamiters, Kearney and Haines,
who were recently arrested in Rotterdam.
PARIS, France, Sept. 24.â United States

NOT TO BE SENT
DOWN TO FLORIDA
Instead of Going South the
Fifth Artillery Will Be
Sent East.
RELIEVES THE FIRST.
Orders That Caused Such a Com
motion at the Presidio Are
Modified.
ONE THEORY AS TO THE CHANGE
It Is Said That The R- gttuent Is Trans
ferred in Order to Get General
Graham Away.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 21.â The
Filth Artillery is in luck. Instead of
being assigned lo &tutions on the South
Atlantic Coast, now occupied by the Third
Artillery, as promulgated in War Depart
ment orders last week, it will bo as
signed to much pleasanier posts.
Secretary Lamont to-day issued orders
mollifying those of last weelc, which as
signed the Fifth Artillery to station! now
occupied by the Third. The new orders
transfer the Fifth Artillery to the posts
now occupied by the First Artillery on
the North Atlantic Coast and in the De
-1 ariiuent of .Missouri. One of the two
light batteries of the lift will take sta
tions at Fort Sheridan (Chicago) and the
other at Fort Hamilton, N. Y. v
The First Artillery will be sent to garri-
SOU the posts vacated by the Third Artil
lei which regiment will bo assigned to
the posts now occupied by the Fifth Ar
tillery on the Pacific Coast.
The light battery of the First, now at
Fort Hamilton, will take station a: Wash
ington, 1). C, barracks, and one battery of
the First, now at Sheridan, will be sent to
Fort Houston. It is not known yet just
where the different batteries of the Fifth
Artillery or other regiments will bo sta
tioned. The War Department officials
â¢ay that these details will not be arranged
fur a lew days. As soon as the battery as
â¢icnmentt are made they will be published
in Tuk Call,
Thk Call correspondent asked a War
Department official the reason for the
modification of the original order, and
was given the written reply: "The object
of the modiucation of the original orders
is to effect more complete rotation of the
station of regiments and batteries by send
ing Northern regiments South, Southern
troop* West and Western troops North
east," . .
It is believed, however, that. General
Miles considers a change of stations bene
ticial to the service for another .reason. .
He thinks that when soldiers are sta
tioned a long time in any one place the
attachments so formed and the social obli
gations incurred and social functions en
joyed are calculated to detract from the
efficiency of the army, und therefore,
deems it best to give them an occasional
taste of the hardship of army life, and
then again he believes in equalizing mat
ter?, so that those whose lots have been
cast in pleasant lines, situated at posts
near great cities, shall give way to those
who have tolerated the â¢amidunes of
Florida and the aria plains of the far
West.
It was said at the War Department to
day that all the enlisted men now with
the transferred regiments who have six
months or more to Â»rrve, and who do not
desire to re-enlist in their present regi
ments, will be allowed to remain at their
present stations, if any prefer.
After all the alarm and talk the Fifth
Artillery Regiment will not go to Florida.
About noon yesterday Colonel Shafter,
commanding the Department of California,
received the following by wire:
WaiÂ«Hl>Â»Otox, D i .. sÂ«H>t. 24, l!j9<>.
OoiuMamiing Gcnrrat. Jhpai tment of California,
San Franeitco, Cal.: \\ iUi the approval of thÂ»
Secretary ol War, a.-neral orders 43, current
series from this In* c, regarding changes of
artillery regiment*, an modified &i follows:
The Fifth Artillery will relieve -lie First Anil
lery la the departments 01 the KnÂ»t and ilis
â¢ourl. One light batter; ottbe Fifth Artillery,
to bo selecteU by ihecouiwatiaingofÃcerof the
rvgiineat, will take station at Fort Sheridan
ana the other at Fort Hamilton. By com
mand Ot M.IJOR-OKJCKRAI. Milks.
Rcgglss, Adjutant-General. â 
The fact that such orders bad been
received was at once communicated by
General 0. D. Greene, adjutant-general of
the department, to the Presidio, Fort
0 and Alcatrar. Toe oncers and en
listed men were MOB apprised oi the otlicial
dispatch, and in some quarter-; much
gratification was expressed.
In reply to inquiries on behalf of The
Call General Graham said that enlisted
men would have the right to elect whether
they should remain in California and be
transferred to the Third Artillery or go to
New York with their own regiment.
At the Presidio canteen and in quarters
the men discussed the modified order. It
is known mat nearly one-tuird of the regi
meat had signified a desire to remain in
San Francisco when thÂ« proposed trans
fer to Florida was under consideration.
It was the sentiment of the soldiers that
the transfer to New York would not
materially diminish the number voting to
remain. To-day or to-morrow the name*
of enlisted men desiring to stay here will
be forwarder to department headquarters.
The modified order provides that one
light battery of the Fifth will go to Fort
Sheridan, Chicago, and toe other to Fort
Hamilton, New York. It is known that
Captain Thorp's Light Battery D will be
stationed at For: Hamilton and Captain
Keilly's Light Battery I will go to Chicago.
This assignment is agreeable to the bat
ten- commanders.
General Graham's headquarters, should
toe regiment go to New York, will be
tori Hamilton. Taree batteries, will go
there, but the general has not vet made a
recommendation as to the alignment.
ThreÂ« batteries go to Fort Waslsworth,
three to Fort Slocum and one goes to Fort
Monroe.
Army otters jurraise that the modifica
tion of the order was by direction of the
becretary of War. whose attention was
called by repeated telegrams and press
comment to the unfairness of sending thÂ«
Hfth Artillery for a fourth tour of duty in
Monda sine* the war, while the First had
served but one tour there since 1865.
Obviously it was the purpose of certain
officers near headquarters in Washington
to rush the Fifth away from the Presidio
at once and so get the regiment on the
rail before the Secretary of War had time
to investigate.
When Secretary Lament goes over. the
whole scheme carefully he ruav further
modify the order by- directing the Filth to
remain at the Presidio until toe Third has
served a tour of three years in New York
harbor. This is said to bo in exact line
with the roster. The great expense of
moving two regiments across the conti
nent at this time is thought by many well
informed men to be wholly unnecessary.
1 here is quiet gossip to "thÂ« effect that
some officers of high rank are figurine to
get General Graham away from tae Pre
biaio, ana la order to reach that end it
has been found expedient to takn the en
tire regiment away from this department.
It Is said that General (trnham as post

Charles S. Fairchild, the permanent

congratulation from the rhairuian of the

the convention of August SI aajourned to

pleasure of the convention. Secretary
Henry 11. Sherman then called the roll.
When the rollcall was finished Kdward M.

Congress who does not unequivocally ac
cept and indorse the platform adopted by
the National convention at Indianapolis.
John de Witt Warner presented an ad
it ress to the Democracy oi the State of
New York, which was prepared by the
Btate Committee, and was adopted as a
declaration of principles for which the
convention stands. It is, iv part, as foi
lews:
The Democratic party, from Its formation as
exemplified by the teachings of its illustrious
iouuders aud leaders, in its formal actions and
in the sentiments of the great mass of its ad
herents, has always contended for a faithful
performance of public and private contract!!,
au honest currency, respect lor and obedience
to judicial authority, and that the creation of
class distinctions foreign to the genius of our
institutions would 'inevitably menace the
safety of the Republic Because we maintain
thai the principles declared at Saratoga aud
reiterated at Indianapolis tire too important
and sacred to yield to the clamor of party regu
larity we are charged with attempting to dis
rupt the parly. *â¢Â»â¢â¢
-â¢ The story of the Chicago Convention need
not be told in detail. A majority of that mis
guided defied and trampled underfoot
the chief principles of Democracy and nomi
nated a candidate who is willing to be known
as a Democrat in name provided the party will
tease to be Democratic In principle.
The events at Buffalo are too recent to re
quire extended comment. Impelled by a
latalisxu whica has no parallel in the history
of politics the convention lashed itself to the
corpse of Populism. Is the offense in the plat
form of the Buffalo Convention palliated ana
are Democrats to be placated by the inhar
monious opinions of its candidates-opinions so
little respected, even by himself, that ho will
repudiate them for his rote? .No.

Cooper, traveling salesman in the tobacco
and cigar department of Craig, Stnart <fc
Co., whose place of business ia on South

with him about fJOO of the firm's money.
Cooper, since the death of bis wife, is
said to have led a somewhat wild life, but
I unfortunately for his employers his bad
; habits were not known. The story of his
downfall and the fact that the detectives
are looking for him leaked out in some
mysterious manner and was the general
topic of conversation among cigar-dealers
to-day. It was learned this morning that
a complaint had been filed charging nim
i with lelony embezzlement. At police
headquarters the correspondent was in
formed that every effort was being put
forward to catch Cooper, but owing to the
fact that he has two days' start the chances
for overtaking him are not very good.

WHEN RAILROADS
DO NOT AGREE
An Open Rupture in the
Western Freight Asso
ciation.
TWO LINES WITHDRAW
Santa Fe and the Rock Island
Grow Weary of Double
Dealing.
AGREEMENTS ABE ALL BROKEN
Now the Companies Propose to Reduce
Rates to Suit Their Own
Convenience.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 24.â Quite a sen
sation was sprung in railroad circles this
evening by the withdrawal of the Athison,
Topeka and Santa Fe and the Chicago,
Rock Island ana Pacific companies from
the Western Freight Association. The
letters of- notification to Chairman Miag
ley are very firm and uncompromising and
indicate a very unsatisfactory state of af
fairs among the thirty-four lines compris
ing the association.
On behalf of the Santa Fe Paul Morton
writes Commissioner Midgley that, after
having been solicited to join the associa
tion in order to strengthen it, his company
was "extremely disappointed in the result
of the organization."
"The Western Freight Association agree
ment," he continues, "is being violated
every day by the issuance of independent I
and unauthorized tariffs and other irregu
lar methods, in consequence of which we
see nothing further to De gained by con
tinuing our membership in the associa
tion as at present organized, and this is to
give notice of our intention to withdraw
therefrom ten days from to-day."
In conclusion Mr. Morton says that "if
the time ever comes when there is appar- j
ently a desire on the part of our com
petitors to enter into an agreement and
carry it out honestly and literally we
shall be glad to join them."
For the Chicago, Rock Island and
Pacific Traffic Manager J. M. Johnson
refers to the appeal recently issued by
Chairman Midgley "for orderly methods,"
and says: "This seems to us to be a for
mal and official announcement by you of
what, in fact, has been the case for about
two months, viz. : a virtual abandonment
of the Western Freight Association by all
lines members of it. l'he only feature of
the agreement of this association that has
ever been of any substantial benefit to
members of it is the one which requires
all lines, before making any reductions in
rates other than those to meet outside
competition, to present the same for con
sideration at the regular meetings of the
association.

[mentof this method of making rates js,
j therefore, virtually an abandonment of

is concerned it*can see no possible advan

agreement and associat.on only in name,
and, as you state in your communication
before referred to, has no binding force,
power or effect whatever upon any of its
members."
The Rock Island also gives notice of a
negative vote in tne matter of restor
ing rates on packing-house products
of all kinds to those in effect August 1,
and announces its intention to reduce
rates on the 2Stii imt. as follows:
Proportional rates to Rock Island on
fresh meats in car lots from Wichita, 16>Â£
cents; Kansas City, St. Joseph and
Omana, 10 cents. On packing-house prod
ucts, carloads, Wichita, 14J4 cents; Kansas
City, etc., 8 cents; other points in propor
tion.
Commenting on this Commissioner
Midgley says:
"This tariff bears the notation: 'The
rates named above are not regarded as
fair compensation for the service, but are
forced on this company by competition of
other lines.' The Wabash also notifies it
will protect on wheat, carloads, 11 cents
per 100 pounds as proportional rate
Kansas City to Toledo and Detroit.
"The foregoing notices will throw light
upon some of the difficulties against which
the undersigned has recently contended in
tho earnest efforts put forth to obtain
natural advances in the rates on grain,
also on pacKing-house products."

"You may put that down along 'ith the

turned the glass and passed the back of
his band lightly across his eloquent lips.
"I wish you were a Soudanese camel,"
discontentedly growled the barkeeper, as
he rinsed the glass.
"Inasmuch as to wherefore?" the Cap'n
wondered. "Because they allus takes a

added.
"Xo." retorted tae barkeeper, wit)ing off
the counter.
"Because they co twenty days without

Gladstone Urges Vigorous
Steps Regarding the
Sultan.
MASSACRES MUST CEASE.
Turkey's Underhand Policy
Should Not Be Countenanced
by the Powers.
IUROPEAN WAR NOT WANTED.
But England Is Urged to Act Inde
pendently in the Interests
of Humanity.
LIVERPOOL, England, Bept 24.â Four
thousand persons were present at the
mass-meeting held in Hengler's circus
this afternoon under the auspices of the
Liverpool Reform Club to protest apainst
the rule of the Sultan of Turkey and the
massacres of Armenians in the Turkish
empire. The gathering included well
known men of all political parties, and
the audience which greeted Mr. Glad
stone, who was the principal speaker, was
a most enthusiastic one. The meeting
was presided over by the Earl of Derby.
Mr. Gladstone was in excellent health and
voioe and was noticeably active in his
movements.
Prefacing his address, Mr. Gladstone
proposed a resolution setting forth that
the meeting trusted that the Government
realized the terrible condition in which
their fellow Christians in Turkey were
placed and that they would do everything
possible to obtain for them a full measure
of security and protection.
The resolution also declared that the
Government would have tne fullest public
support in whatever steps it might take
tn put a stop to the atrocities wtiich were
being committed in Turkey.
Mr. Gladstone, as be stepped forward to
begin his remarks, was cheered for many
minutes. Mr. Gladstone said:
"The resolution which I have proposed
observes the rules of prudence, and does
not require, even for the sake of a great
end, that we place ourselves in a state of
war with uniteri Europe."
Continuing, he ridiculed the idea that a
state of war would be the result or conse
quence of England's acting alone in giv
ing an ultimatum to the Porte. He would
not be the one to plunge Kngland into
war, but England would not make of her
self a slave to be dragged by the chariot
wheels of the other powers of Europe.
[Cheers.]
England, he said, had a just right to
coerce Turkey, and the first step must be
the recall of our Embassador from Con
stantinople and the consequent dismissal
of the Turkish Embass&dor in London.
[Loud and prolonged cheers.] That
would not rause a European war. [Cheers
and laughter.] England could then tell
the Porte that she meant to consider
means of enforcing ncr own just demands.
"We should declare," he continued,
"that we would not turn any ensuing war
to our own advantage. The concert of
Europe is an august and useful instru
ment, but it has not usually succeeded in
dealing with the Eastern question, which
has arrived at a period when it is neces- I
sary to strengthen the hands of the Gov- j
eminent by an expression of National
opinion. I believe that the con
tinued presence of the Embassadors at I
Constantinople has operated as a distinct !
countenance to the Sultan, who is thus j
their reco~nized aily. But while urging j
the Government to act, it does not follow I
thai even for the sake of the great object '
in view Great Britain should transplant j
Europe into a state of war. On the other j
hand, however, I deny that England must
abandon her right to independent judg
ment and allow hers. If to be domineered
by the other powers. [Cheers.]
Mr. Gladstone said the Turkish Govern
ment in 1876 denied the massacres had
occurred but that these massacres bad
since passed into history as facts. The
same system of denials is practiced now
and will be practiced so long as tne pow
ers of Europe shall tolerate ii.
It is to oe hoped, Mr. Gladstone de
clared, that the weakness of diplomacy
would be strengthened by this strong na- j
tion's voice. Diplomatic representatives
in Constantinople of six great powers
after the massacre in the Turkish capital
brought their courage to the sticking point
and addressed a note to the Sultan, in
forming his Majesty that the atrocities
should cease, or that otherwise a prejudice
would be created against the Turkish Gov
ernment.
"I," continued Mr. Gladstone, "askwnat j
would the guilty author of these massacres
want more than to confine the matter to a
paper war?" [Loud cheers.]
Mr. Gladstone said that six great powers
of Europe represented at Constantinople
had failed to make the Sultan fulfill his j
treaty obligations. Tne continuation of I
diplomatic relations with the Sultan had j
not prevented the horrible massacres at
Constantinople, but it had permitted
the Sultan to remain the recognized ally
of Great Britain. Gladstone in the course
of h;s peroration said:
"Let us extract ourself from oar present
ambiguous post. Let as renounce our
neutrality. Let us, by loyally promising
her Majesty's Ministers our ungrudging
and enthusiastic support, induce them by |
word and deed to show their detestation j
of acts which may even yet come to such I
a depth of atrocity as has never vet been j
recorded in the deplorable history of |
human crime." [Loud and prolonged
cheers-!
Mr. Gladstone's voice remained strong
and clear to the end. The resolutions of
fered by the ex- Premier were adopted
unanimously.
BERLIN, Germany, Sept. 24.â A Con
stantinople dispatch to tue Lokal Anzieger
says that the diplomats in the Turkish
capital have been instructed to suspend
tlieir conferences on the Armenian ques
tion, as direct negotiations are pending
between the Porte and the powers.
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Sept. 24.â
In a restrained and dignified nrticleon the
Armenian question, the Russia Gazette
urges, in the interests of European peace
and unon principles of humanity, a reap
proacliinent between Russia and Great
Britain.
It declines to indorse the suggestion that
Great Britain arranged the massacres in
her own interests, and declares that it be
lieves that toe sympathy of the powers is
on her side, It is in favor of decisive pres
sure beine brought to bear on the Porte,
to whose faulty poyerntnent Is largely due
the dark side of recent events.
The Gazette adds: Strict watchfulness
of the interests of Russia -in the East can
not be considered by Russian diplomacy
as anabsolute impediment to the establish
ment in the near future of such an entente
with Great Britain and trie other powers
as will afford a solution of the compli
cated question which unceasingly alarms
Europe.

NEARLY A DISASTER
Light Engine Runs Into a Passenger
Train Near Mountain fiete.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 24.â The south
bound passenger train, due here from San
Francisco at 12:40 o'clock, collided with a
light engine just south of Mountain View
to-day. A turn in the road was being ap
proached. A moment later the engineer
on the passenger train could not have
seen the engine approaching and there
would have been a disastrous wreck. The
passenger engine was reversed and came
to a standstill. The light engine contin
ued, but so slowly that when the crash
came only the cowcatchers on the two
engines were wrecked, and neither of them
nor any of the cars ieft the track. The
shock threw a number of passengers from
their seats, but no one was hurt except
Mrs. George Peck of Troy, N. V., who had
her knee badly bruised.
The cause of the presence of the engine
on the track on the time of a passenger
train could not be learned. The collision
did not delay the passenger train long.

Although to the world at large and in
fact to t c majority of the residents of
this city Republicanism during the past
few weeks in this locality has seemingly
occupied a restful seat â in reality there
has been a vast amount of quiet prepara
tory work accomplished. Within a very
short time the Republicans of Sacramento
will enter the political arena with a rush
which will undoubtedly carry everything
before it
One of the greatest surprises to the
party's political enemies has been the en
thusiastic spirit which has developed
among the bard-handed sons of toil, wbo
labor in the various departments of the
railroad shops in this city. Although
fully assured that their political liberty
would in no way be interfered with, and
that they might wear Bryan badges as
large as a mill wheel if they so wished and
believed in the windy ban ncr- Dearer of
free silver, they have on the contrary
chosen in the main to enroll themselves
beneath the banner of McKinley and sound
money.
The employes of carshop 5 were the
first to come out and declare themselves,
and night after nigbt they have repaired
to the Capitol grounds after their hard
day's work and drilled for hours in all the
various marching evolutions practiced by
crack military corps. They are rapidly
attaining perfection. Their example very
evidently stimulated competition, and
now nearly every department of the vast
plant has organized a McKinley and
sound-money club and are spending their
evenings in drill practice, so that when
the era of torchlight parades dawns on
the political horizon the most proficiently
drilled bodies of men who will gather
beneath the banner of Republicanism will
oe the stalwart laborers ot the railroad
shops. Nor are the local Assembly clubs
at all idle. As yet they refuse to divulge
their intentions. The Twenty-first Astem
bly Republican Club has 454 names upon
its roster, every one of whom is a stench
believer in protection. Toe Twentieth
Assembly Republican Club has fully as
many members, and the McKinley Club
even more, while there are numerous

CARLSON AT MADERA.
The Independent Congressional Candi
date* Original Platform.
MADERA, Cal., Sept. 24.â Mayor Carl
son of San Diego, independent candidate
for Congress, spoke here to-night in favor
of protection to American fruit-growers
and more money for American working
men through his plan for the Government
to erect a public building in every county
seat of the Nation where it is to-day a
tenant and thus stop paying rent, which
aggregates $10,000,000 a year. The money
now paid as rent, he said, could be used
to redeem the proposed public improve
ment currency of $500,000,000, thereby
avoiding any more bond issues and save
paying interest. He says his prospects
have improved since the withdrawal of L.
J. Maddux, the straight Democratic can
didate. Mayor Carlson spoke at Merced
last night.
Silver Solicitor From Colorado.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 24.â M. 8.
Taylor, the silver orator of Colorado,
spoke to a large audience here to-night.
The local silver men had left no stone
unturned in providing a reception for the
eloquent advocate of their favorite doc
trine and were well rewarded for their
trouble. The speaker's view of the finan

moie persuasive than argumentative and

TROUBLE IN THE ORIENT
The Anti- Foreign Feeling at
Foo Chow Causes Much
Uneasiness.
Japanese Coasting Steamers Overhaul
and Assault Vessels of Other
Nations.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 24.â The
steamship Empress of India arrived yes
terday from the Orient. Among the pas
sengers is his Excellency Yen Nien, who
is intrusted with an itrportant diplomatic
mission to Washington by the Emperor
of China.
Foo Chow was to have been opened up
as a treaty port on (he 7th inst. The
Shanghai papers loudly praise United
States Consul Jarnigan, as it was mainly
due to him that the port was opened, the
officials having adopted obstruction tac
tics.
Numerous assaults have been made on
foreigners by Japanese coasting steamers,
and foreign engineers and officers have
applied to the Consuls to bave a severe
penalty inflicted in such cases.
Much uneasiness prevails in the province
of Foo Chow owing to the anti-foreign
feeling that appears to be developing
among the natives. It is said that the
city of Kien Nieng Fa has been placarded
since August 24 to the effect that foreign
properties will be burned down and all
foreigners found therein massacred. Dr.
Rigg is the only foreigner there, and
Archdeacon Wolfe, on receipt of this in
telligence, took immediate steps to get the
Chinese officials in that city to protect Dr.
Rigg and his mission party.
It is rumored that Li Hung Chang on
his return to China will be reinstated in
all his former positions, including that of
Viceroy of Chihli, and that Viceroy Wang,
the present holder of the post, is rapidly
losing credit in Peking.
FOUR MURDERERS EXECUTED.
Neta Mexico Establishes Her Claims to
Statehood.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mex., Sept. 24.â
Donicio Sandoval, who shot and killed
Victoriano Tenorio in this county in July,
1895, was executed here this morning at 8
o'clock before a crowd of several thousand.
He refused to say a word on the scaffold
and was calm and composed to tne last.
He was pronounced dead twelve seconds
after the drop.
Perfecto Padilla, who assassinated John
Vipond. a miner, and Rosario Rine, who
shot and killed Carlos Mibarri, were exe
cuted this morning at Tierra Amarilla.
Still another execution occurred at Ros
weli, where Antonio Gonzales paid the
death penalty for the murder ot Charles
Van Sycle.
All of these cases have been fought from
the lowest to the highest conrts. The last
appeal was settled on the Btd of this
month and the murderers were again sen
tenced.
Arrested for Mann laughter.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept 24.â "Doc" W.
H. Maple, a nicicel-in-the-slot machine
agent, was arrested to-night for man
slaughter. A week ago his wife, anspect
ing an undue intimacy between himself
and a Mrs. Jennie Melcher, a married
woman, forced him to write Mrs. Meicher
a letter decoying her to an office in the
McKey building. Upon the arrival of the
unsuspecting woman Maple held her
while his wife assaulted her in a most in
human manner. As a result of the assault
this morning Mrs. Melcher waa delivered
of a dead child.

PROLONGING THEIR SUSPENSE.
Nothing in the Act to Indicate That
the Murderers Will Escape
the Gallows.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept 24.âGov
ernor Budd has granted a stay of execu
tion of the death sentence of the Cum
mings brothers, who were to have suffered
the extreme penalty of the law at San
Quentin to-morrow, for a period of thirty
aays, or until October 30. This leniency
upon the part of the Executive, however,
is not at nil indicative that the death sen
tence will not be ultimately carried out,
as the sole reason for granting the re
prieve is the failure, of the sentencing
Judge to carry out that section of the
Penal Code which provides that a copy of
all the evidence in capital crimes must be
forwarded to the Governor's office. This
was not done in the Cummings brotl.ers'
case, and when applications for mercy
were received at the Governor's office in
their behalf the Executive found that the
trial testimony was missing and he was
unable to properly examine into the mer
its of the case, and to enable him to do so
he granted the commutation.
MAKE A CONFESSION.
Story Told on What 'Ihey Believed to Be
Thiir Last Day.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Sept. 24.â John
and C'ie-ar Cummings, the two young
men now in San Quentin wbo were to be
executed to-morrow for the killing of the
Riverside rancher, T. C. Narramore, re
ceived at 3 o'clock this afternoon from
Governor Budd a reprieve making the
day when they shall be hanged Oc
tober 27.
To-day the youths made what they
thought was their dying confession.
They said that they, with a Mexican,
rented the ranch of Narramore, h6 repre
senting that the hay crop would realize
$2000.
They eot only $500 for the crop, and the
three planned to pay Narramore the
money and then rob him of it. Pursuant
to their scheme, John paid the money,
shortly after which the Mexican and
Caesar came in masked, bound Narramore
and John and possessed themselves of the
money. In the struggle the Mexican
killed Narramore. Afterward the three
were arrested on suspicion. The Mexican
turned State's evidence, accusing the
brothers of the murder.
Since their sentence was passed the Gov
ernor has received a petition from River
side to which was appended 650 names,
among them seven of the jurymen on the
case and that of the District Attorney who
tried them. The stay of execution was ob
tained from the Governor by the efforts of
Prison Director J. H. Wilkins and J. W.
Cochrane. There is rumor of petitions in
their behalf being circulated in the city.
MOORE ARRIVES AT NAPA
Mrs. Greenwood's Murderer on
the Scene oi His Awful
Crime.
The Prisoner's Confession Supported
by County Treasurer Gardner's
Identification.
NAPA. Cal., Sept. 21â This afternoon,
at 1 o'clock, Sheriff McKenzie of Napa,
Sheriff Burr and W. E. Sbaug of Los
Angeles brought William Moore, the self-
accused murderer of Mrs. Greei.wood, to
Napa. They drove to Napa from Vallejo
Junction, having missed the morning's
boat at South Vallejo on the way from the
south. There is no doubt among the peo
ple of Napa that the accused man is the
murderer. It was noised abroad that he
was coming, and a crowd of people were
in waiting at the courthouse to witness
the landing of the individual against
whom an awful crime rests.
There was no^excitement â just a quiet
manifestation of satisfaction that the
murderer had been caught. Mr. Green-
wood was in the Sheriff's office awaiting
the Sheriffs arrival, but he was unable to
identify the man when he was brought
before him. This is not to be wondered
at. however, as Mr. Greenwood was not
acquainted with Moore, ana had only seen
him once previous to the night of the
murder.
County Treasurer George F. Gardner, as
soon as he saw the prisoner, exclaimed,
"That is the man."
On the way to NapaMooresaidhs
would point out the Greenwood house.
True to his promise, when they reached
the house, which is on the county road,
Moore said, "That is the house." He
also pointed out the place where he had
thrown the harness on the night of the
murder. This was the very place where
Sheriff McKenzie had picked up thejhar
ness the next morr.ine. The officers" say
there is no doubt of the guiit of the man.
Sheriff Burr of Los AngeJes, who surely
ought to be able to judge, says most em
phatically that Moore is beyond all ques
tion the guilty man. As Moore has con
fessed, all doubt as to his guilt has passed
away. He tried to keep back nothing,
but "told all, confirming much that came
out in the trial of Schmidt, his partner in
crime. He ij small in stature, wiry of
build and shows in his talk ana move
ments great nervous strain and the ill
effects of a long "booze." Before leaving
Vallejo it was necessary to have him pre
scribed for by a physician ana to give him
medicine that would quiet him.
RIVERSIDE'S BRUTAL CRIME.
Two More Indians Arrested for the Mur
der nf Mrs. Platt.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., Sept. 24.â The bru
tal murder of Mrs. Platt, a teacher on the
Pachango Indian reservation in this
county, which event occurred nearly two
years ago, was brought to notice again to
day by the arrest of a couple of Indians
named Friico Rodriguez and Antonio
Trujillo, who it is believed had a hand in
the crime. Both these men were arrested
shortly after the murder with two others,
named Antonio Molido and Francisco
Guavish, and all four were at that time
charged with the crime. Molido -peached
on his pals, telling the whole story of the
crime in all its reeking details. This was
at the trial of the other three men, held
about a year ago. The jury disagreed,
however, and when the trials came on
again Guavish was tried separately.
He was acquitted Â»nd the officers then
discharged Rodriguez and Trujillo. Mo
lido was given a life sentence in the peni
tentiary, where he now is, and Guavish
was later convicted of robbery in Los
Angeles County and sentenced to fifteen
years in the penitentiary.
.Ever since the discharge of Rodriguez
and Trujillo the officers have been diligent
in their search for new evidence in the
case and the arrest of the two men is the
result of their researches. The murder of
Mrs. Piatt was terribly brutal. She was
taken from her home at midnight and
ravished by the four men, according to
Molido's story, after which they dragged
raw TO-DAY.

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EtKCTION SOTEMBEK 3, 1896.
Charles L. Taylor will win.
Loyal Republicans are ready for action.
Party regularity is the only safe basis of
party harmony.
Straight politics is always good enough
for straight men.
The regular Republican ticket is the
only Republican ticket.
The Republican party has named the
man, and the people will elect him.
Why should any Republican help to
elect a Democrat because he calls himself
a Non-Partisan? _
Sore-headed bolters from the Republican
ticket will be sorer-headed still when the
bolt falls on them.
By his faithful and efficient service as a
Supervisor Mr. Taylor has well merited a
promotion to the office of Mayor.
This is a year of political freaks. Who
ever heard before of a Congressional com
mittee calling a municipal convection?
The only way to rid the municipal gov
ernment of Buckleyism, Raineyism and
Keilyism is to stand up for straight poli
tics and elect the Republican ticket.
One of the immediate questions of City
politics is wheiher Mr. Phelan is a Non-
Partisan, a Democrat or a Rainey faction
Jeader.
Loyal Republicans will unite in support
Â« f the regular ticket, and let the bolters
serve the purpose of Buckley or Rainey as
they choose.
To elect the whole party ticket Repuoli
cans must be united. It is impossible to
make a clean sweep ii there are any gaps
in the broom.
The way to Republican harmony is open
to all. Nothing is required of any man
except that he join the procession and
keep step with the music.
Bryan has sufficient gall to claim to be
standing on the platform of Lincoln, but
the country will take notice it was not the
party of Lincoln that nominated him.
It is very strange that the Tammany
braves should try to pull down John Boyd
Thacher when they have only to wait
awhile and see the people pull him down.
Tt is well known that Boss Kelly be
trayed the Republican ticket in 1894 and
aided in tie. eating Estee. Work of that
kind is the politics that is regular with
him.
It will be an easy choke for true Repub
licans and good ciiizens to decide whether
they will vote with men who tri d to elect
Estee or with those who knifed him in the
back.
Unity for the local ticket means uuity
for the National ticket, and the same vote
that elects Taylor to the mayoralty will
pi\-e the vote of the City for McKinley and
Hobart.
Ihe Republican party will maintain the
standard of American wages, the standard
of American money, th^ standard of
American industry and the standard of
the Republic.
Men who seek to divide the Republican
party and endeavor to discredit its leaders
can always count on the support of the
Kx&mmer, for they are freaks and their
ways are fakes.
If you have any doubt which is the true
Republican ticket just read the Democratic
organ and see which one it denounces and
which one it pats on the back and encour
ages to stay in the held.
The Non- Partisans have indorsed the
Rainey candidate, James D. Pbeian, for
Mayor, but the true independent voters
will support the Republican candidate,
Charles L. Taylor, and elect h.'m.
One of the sights of the times ia the
view of English, Foote, Coleman, Wise
and Murphy sitting on the fence and
watching Cator take the Senatorial water
melon out of the Democratic patch.
By every party tradition and custom, by
unbroken descent of title, by every prin
ciple of political self-government Uie
Auditorium Convention is the regular Re
publican Convention of this City, and all
of its nominees are entitled to the full sup
port of the party.
In discussing the silver question May 4,
1895, the Examiner said: "To maintain
the parity alone it might be necessary to
mak6 the proportion 25 to 1" ; but it now
declares for going it alone at 16 to 1, thus
showing that Mr. Hearst's opinions ate
about an fluctuating as the price of his sil
ver bullion
THE PLAIN PACTS.
We published yesterday the opinions of
a number of the ablest lawyers in the City
on the daim of the Auditorium conven
tion to be the true representative of the
Republican party of San Francisco. AH
with one accord agreed that the claim is
beyond dispute by any fair-minded man.
Any opposing claim is either an absurdity
or an impudence. The law and the facts
are too p!ain to be contradicted or
evaded. Whoever would support the or
ganized Republicans of San Francisco
must support the platform and the nom
inees of the Auditorium convention.
The authority of such men as Judges
S. C. Denson, Henry C. Dibble, Hon.
Thomas D. Riordan, J. Alva Watt and
John M. Chretien will have weiebt with
every man w. o is willing to accept the
judgment of those most familiar with the
laws and customs of party organizations in
this City. To those, however, who are
capable of studying facts for themselves
and drawing right conclusions from them,
no authority is needed to make clear so
plain a case as this. The facts are simple.
The Auditorium convention was called
by the Republican County Committee,
the delegates were elected in accordance
with that call and the convention was or
ganized under its authority. The present
County Committee is the only rightful
successor of the preceding County Com
mittee, which called into existence the
convention of 1694. That committee, as
Mr. Watt clearly pointed out, "was the
successor of its predecessors called into
existence and organized in the same man
ner during many years."
The line of succession from one County
Committee to another in due form of that
custom which has constituted the law of
political practice in this State has never
been broken. Nor was the right of the
County Committee to call the convention
ever disputed until this year, when cer
tain men, for their own purposes, sought
to divide the party to ruin it if they could
not rule it.
That earnest and loyal Republicans who
understand the serious issues dependent
on the municipal campaign are exasper
ated by this division in tha party ranks is
natural. The Republican party in this
City is not stronc enough to waste any of
its strength in divisions and wranglings.
For the party to be divided on election
day may mean defeat, notwithstanding
there will be two Democratic candidates
in the field, and that defeat may
involve a continuance of the bad
government under which we have
suffered too long already. It is to these
earnest and intelligent Republicans the
regular convention of the party appeals.
Every effort has been made by the ieaders
of the party to reconcile the bolters and
restore the unity of the organization.
If division is insisted upon by those who
are careless of Republican success it will
not be the fault of tho*e who stand for the
party organization.
Loyal Republicans can take but one
course at this juncture. If they would

The depression in the price of wheat, it is
now said, must be accounted for in some other
way. The chief of the United States Bureau
of Statistics states that the consumption of
wheat per capita in 1395 was 25 per cent less
than in 1892. Do you not think that this
might be a more reasonable accounting for
the depreciation in the pria of wheat than to
charge it to the legislation of twenty- three
yean ago? â McKinlry.
THE NON-PARTISAN BLUNDER.
The Non-Partisan convention has al
ready shown itself incompetent to deal
with the political situation in a way to
benefit the people. The undue haste dis
played in hurrying through an indorse
rnent of the nominee of the Rainey Demo
crats for Mayor disclosed anything rather
than a careful reeard for the selection
of the best candidate for the most im
portant office in the municipality, and the
mistake thus made will not be overlooked
by those to whom the Non -Partisans must
turn to find votes on election day.
It is a maxim of common prudence to
intrust complex and difficult duties oniv
to those who have been tried and proven
themselvc worthy of such trust. No one
questions Mr. Phelan's excellence and
merit as a private citizen, but he has had
no official experience, and if elected would
enter upon the office of Mayor a whoily
untried ana untrained official. Had there
been no worthy competitor to Mr. Phelan
before the Non-Partisans his selection
would have been readily understood.
There was, however, before them a candi
date who is fuily the equal of Mr. Phelan
as a private citizen, lias had a longer and
fuller experience in the conduct of busi
ness, and, moreover, has been tried in
official life and proven himself to be a
most faithful, efficient and sagacious man
ager of public affairs. That man is the
nominee of the Republican party, Charles
L. Taylor.
The indorsement of men who claim to be
indifferent to party and devoted to the gen
eral welfare was of right due to Mr. Tay
lor. When an official serves the people
well he is entitled to some recognition of
his services. He that has been faithful in
little things should be given charge of
greater things. Merit should have its re
ward. How can men of character be en
couraged to undertake the task of munici
pal work if they are to receive neither
thanks, approval nor indorsement from,
the better citizens of the community ?
It is not likely that the intelligent and
independent vote of the City will follow
the Non-Partisans in this choice. Inde
pendent voters are reading people, and
they know what Supervisor Taylor has
done for the City and the public welfare.
They know he can be trusted. They know
he has by his past service deserved the
support of all good citizens-and the honor
of an election to a higher office than that
which he now holes. He is, in {net, at thij
juncture, the logical candidate of all who
desire to have a better City government.
In 10-ing the opportunity to give him an
indorsement the Non-Partisans have com
mitted a political blunder which will
weaken their whole campaign, for there is
no excuse whatever to be given for the
folly and haste which led mem to turn to
an untried man instead of uniting to elect
Mr. Taylor.
Ttere is no man of skill who has made this
a subject of study, either in America or in
Europe, who is a bimetallism who believes that
this proceeding of the United States is any
thing but the height of folly from a bimetal
list's point of vi.w, which, means that these
gentlemen who have taiked of bimetallism are
endeavoring to foist upon yon something en
tirely different. They are undertaking to get
your votes on false pretenses. â Tom Reed.

sight. It is a queer situation, and it is a
pity some one on the inside cannot be in
duced to explain it.
Senator White, when you were a candi
date for the Senate you had the support of
many able and influential Democrats.
Why is it you are not now supporting one
of them? Why are you apparently more
â¢ager to have a Populist than a Demo-
cratic colleague? Is there no one within
the ranks of your party whom you would
like to see honored as you have been
honored ? Is there nothing in Democratic
principles that would lead you to support
a Democrat rather than a Populist?
William D. English, you should be in
terested in this matter. You have fought
Democratic battles and shared Democratic
defeats many a year. Why does it turn
from you now to a man who stands for no
Democratic principle, and who seeks for
Democratic success only that he may get
Democratic votes to advance his Populist
ambition?
W. W. Foote, you tave long been a
sterling Democrat. You know what
Democratic principles are and wherein
they differ from Populism. Do you know
why your party should support Mr. Cator
for the Senate? Is he io be sent there to
support the principles of Jefferson and
Jackson? Is he to represent Democracy
in the Senate or does Democracy propose
to abdicate and allow Populism to have all
the spoils it can gather?
James V. Coleman, it is not long since
you were hailed as a rising leader of young
Democracy. Why have you taken a back
seat new? Why are you not fighting to
win the high honor of the senatorship for
some Democrat who will illustrate the De
mocracy of California?
Bernard D. Murphy, you have for
many years been an honored leader
of the conservative wing of your
party, and in the days when you
were honored Cator was laughed at.
Do you know why this change has come
about? Does it suit your ideas of politics
to have the Democratic votes in the next
Legislature turned over to a man who
hasn't been a Democrat since he came
West?
Gentlemen all: What are you to Cator
or Cator to you that you should weep for
him, as surely you will weep if he is
elected? Why have you been catered to
In this, cold way in your own party? Is
all this sacrifice of party principle, pride
and prestige made for the sake of Bryan?
Is he worth that much? Must he look to

GETTING DESPERATE.
Mr. Bryan's attempt to jnstify the
attacks upon the Supreme Court by quot
ing garbled extracts from the Republican
platform of 1860 only shows wbat base
means be would employ to accomplish
his ends. The declaration of the Republi
can party to which Mr. Bryan refers was
in the nature of a protest against "the
dogma that the constitution of ifr own
force carries slavery into all the Terri
tories." The Supreme Court was not de
nounced, nor were there threats made that
if the Republican party elected its candi
date the court would bo reconstructed so
thnt decisions might be had with reference
U) what the party leaders wanted instead
of in conformity to the spirit and letter of
the constitution as the Chicago platform
declares the Democratic party will do. A
man who would resort \o such gross and
inexcusable distortion of facts to deceive
the people for his own profit is hardly
worthy of being the successor of Washing
ton, Jefferson and .Lincoln as chief magis
trate of the Nation.
The protest of the Republican party was
directed against a "nnw dogma" which
practically made the constitution to say
that slavery was a National institution,
and that while a State had the right to
prohibit slavery within its own borders, a
Territory could not do bo because its af
fairs were administered by National au
thority. The Republican party held that
slavery could not and did not exist any
where under the constitution except in
States whose government provided for it.
There was not so much as an intimation
by the convention of 1860 that the court
would be so constituted that a decision an
nulling "the dogma" mi^ht be had, and
Mr. Bryan proves his unworthiness of the
confidence of the peop ! e when ne tries to
make the declaration of tnat convention
appear otherwise.
Mr. Bryan grows desperate as his eco
nomic fallacies are exposed. He insults
the intelligence of the people every day,
but he should have enough sense left to
know that he can nevor reach the White
House over a road that is paved with per
hdy, deceit and subterfuge. Even ia his
desperation he should not fail to remem
ber it is the sober second thought of tue
people that settles politcal issues on elec
tion day, and although his defeat is al
ready determined in taÂ«- minds of the
peonle, there is no reafon why he should
not retain their respect when he retires to
private life, but if he would have them
hold him in high esteem he will have to
hold himself within the bounds of honesty
of acts and purpose.
i
Standing by constitutional authority and
law is the highest obligation of American citi
zenship. Standing by public faith is a call
to supreme duty. Preserving the public creiit
untainted and the currency uncorrupted and
both above challenge anywhere in the wor d is
the command of simple honesty and good
morals. â McKinley.
BRYAN AND THE SILVER MAR
KET.
When Bryan Wai nominated by the
Chicago convention silver was quoted at
69 cents. That was more thaii two months
ago. Since his nomination Mr. Bryan has
been making from two to four speeches a
day and has visited a dozen States. He
has talked of nothing but free silver coin
age at 16 to 1 indepeu lent of other nations,
and he how claims hh election by the
largest majority that was ever given a
Presidential candidate, and yet there has
been a steady depreciation in the market
value of silver, it having fallen from 69
cents an ounce when he was nominated to
653^ cents, which was yesterday's quota
tion. These are facts of market history.
Now, either dealers in bar silver do not
believe Mr. Bryan's election at all pos
sible, or they do not believe him when he
says he will use the power and influence
of the office of President to open the mints
to silver if elected. The latter, however,
hey have no reason to doubt, for there
can be no question about his purpose con
corning the opening of the mints. He is
thoroughly convinced that the silver of
the world should have free and unre
stricted entrance to American mints, and.
moreover, he is in favor of increasing the
number of our mints to meet the demand
ior coinage, which would require about
five times as many as are now in opera
tion.
It must be, then, that owners of silver
mines and dealers in silver bullion have
no expectation that Mr. Bryan will be
elected, for if they believed he had tue
ghost of a chance they would not sell their
holdings at 65% cents an ounce, and on a
declining market at that, when by holding
they could get 129 cents an ounce. Silver
mine owners and speculators in silver bul
lion are not so stupid as to sell their metal
at one-half of the price Bryan says they
are absolutely sure of getting if he is
elected, if they believed there was any
prospect whatever of his winning.
The bullion silver market is a pretty
good political barometer just now, and the
movement of prices makes an interesting
study, because silver values pretty fairly
indicate the faith that dealers in the
white metal have in Bryan's kind
of bimetallism. If, then, silver specu
lators and producers, who are more
interested in Bryan's election than any
other class of people, have so little
faith in his winning that they are willing
to part with their holdings on a declining
market, it certainly should Eatisfy others
that the man's election is not to be con
sidered as a possible outcome of the No
vember vote. To be Btire, great crowds
gather to see the young man and
to hear him speak, but crowds will
gather for any purpose; besides, Bryan's
youth and reckless u.Â«e of language, to
gether with the natural cariosity of hu
manity, are quite enough to insure large
crowds of sightseer. Watch the silver
bullion market, and until you see the
price of the metal begin to climb upward
with a firm and confident step do not
make any wagers that Bryan will be
elected.
What the idle workingman wants is a job.
That means money to him. The mints, if
they were thrown wide open to the coinage of
every character of vietal, and were multiplied
a hundred fold in capacity, would neither
furnish the workingman a job, restore his ex
hausted savings nor give him credit. Noth
ing, my fellow-citizens, will accomplish that
but work, work at fair wages, and that will
only come through confidence restored by a
wist financial and industrial policy. â Mo
Kinley.
THE FIRST VOTER,
Among the delegations visiting Canton
last Thursday was the First-voters' Club
oi Bowling Green, Ohio. But this Is not
the first first-voters' club that has visited
Major McKinley, nor are such clubs few
and far between, so to speak, this year.
. Yonng men all over tne country are or
ganized for the battle, and they are doing
a good work, not only in the way of re
minding the older voters Of their duty,
but they are keeping up a degree of en
thusiasm that is telling for good in all
communities. Major McKinley's talk to
the Bowling Green Club was addressed to
that particular club but what he said is
just as applicable to first- voters' clubs in
othi r sections of the country. He said:
It ' seldom given to the first voters of this
cou: â¢ . to start in in so Important a National
â¢on test, where so much is involved and where
so many interests are at stake. It is a year, too,
when old party divisions count for littleâ
when ai^n of all parties are united in the com
mon oDject to save the country from dishonor
and the currency from degradation.
In some respects the conditions which
confront the first voter this year are very
much like those which confronted the
young men of the country in 1861. Now
as then party lines count for little, and
now as then there are issues which tran
scend party obligations and which make
it incumbent upon the first as well as all
other voters to forget party associations
for the time and battle for a cause that is
common to all voters. There is no threat
of territorial division and separate Gov
ernments now as in 1861, bat the honor
and integrity of the Nation is being
assailed, and there is a purpose to de
grade the monetary system of the coun
try. The first voters are looked to by the
spirit of our institutions to stand by the
Government of their fathers.
There is another reason why the first
voter should take an active part in this
campaign against the application of fal
lacious theories of government. It is pe
culiarly an educational campaign. The
personality of candidates is scarcely being
considered. It is a campaign that is di
rected to governmental policies and eco
nomic questions, with object lessons on
every hand. It is not often that first
voters have such an opportunity to hear
the principles of our Government discussed
by able political economists, and the first
voter should be a careful student and
profit by what he hears and reads, for
upon his shoulders will fall the responsi
bility of leadership in the near future, and
now is the time to prepare himself for it.
And, again, the business and financial
interests of the country Are deeply in
volved in this campaign. The first voters
this year will have to assume the direc
tion of the comm Tee and the industries of
the country after awhile. To their care
will all the great and small business and
financial enterprises be committed sooner
or later, and it is to their personal interest
and advantage that the present high
credit and unspotted integrity of the coun
try be maintained, for in proportion as
Bryanism prevails this year will the man
agement of the country's industries and
commerce be more difficult and unprofita
ble when they come to assume tneir man
agement. The first voter of 1896 must
strengthen or weaken that which will be
his to sunerintend in the future, and there
is no middle road for him to take. There
are two roads. The one Is the road to
commercial safety and prosperity, and the
other is the road to uncertainty, hesitation
and distrust.
THAT DEADLY PARELLEL.
Stockton Independent
The "deadly parallel" has been indulged in
by the Examiner to show that several promi
nent Republican speakers and newspapers
have changed 'their views on the silver ques
tion within a year or two. This was done in
appareut forgctfulncss that the same weapon
could be used against itself. The Call, how
ever, was not bo forgetful, and in yetterday's
issiie reproduces irom the Examiner ol June
27, 1895, an article of some length, in which
it took Kunstantially the same ground as the
National Republican platform adopted one
year later, which it now condemns. It goes
even fartncran.J points out the evils that
would follow from the United States returning
to Iree coinage of silver, jusi as the Republi
cans are doiug now. To show that thin article
was not a matter of inadvertence Thb t all
quotes from five other articles of different
dates, all to the same tenor and effect so far as
free coinage is concerned.
WHY THEY SUPPORT BRYAN
Woodland MalL
Thk Call threw a bomb into the Examiner-
Journal camp Saturday by publishing a state
ment showing that the Hearst estate i 3 inter
ested In silver mines to the extent of $5,911,
-691. This explains in a great measure why
these two papers are supporting Bryan. It ia
not through love for the poor workman, as
they would make believe, but for Wiliie
Hearst, the silver-mine owner.

Free Coinageâ a. Hi. Ophir, Utah. The free
coinage of the silver dollar means the coinage
of a coin stamped a dollar and worth only its
bullion weight. Those who have made a study
of the matter say ttiat if free coinage of silver
should -be the rule the United States would not
undertake to maintain the relative value of
the silver dollar with gold, and that the mar
ket value oi silver would be the standard for
the payment of debts, wages and the like.
Foreign Coinâ t. d. 8., Gubservillo, Santa
Clara County, Cal. That Bectibn of the con.
stitution of the United States which declares
that Congress shall have power to regulate tlio
value of foreign coin means that it shall have
power to pass a law piaoing a value on the
coins of foreign countries offered In the United
States, ns, for instance, the value of the Mexi
can dollar has been fixed at 50.4. That means
that payments in that kind of coin must be
made oa that basis.
President Johnbonâ H. W.. Sonora, Cai. An
drew Jonnson, President oi the United States,
was impeached, but he wss not convicted.
Johnson had come In sharp conflict with
Congress on the questions connected with the
reconstruction measures, and the breach^ be
tween the Executive and the National Legisla
ture widened till it grew into Impeachment â
the only Impeachment of a President in the
history of the United States aud one of the
most rioted in the world. March 2, 1867, Con
gress passed the tenure of office act, which was
vetoed by the President and passed over bis
veto. Edwin M. Stanton, then Secretary
of War, not willing to lend himself to
Johnson's scheme of reconstruction, was
suspended on the 12-.h of August. 1867, by the
President, who appointed General Grant secre
tary ad interim. In January following the
Senate received from the President his reasons
for tne suspension of Stantou, but that body
refused to recognize them, and Stanton re
sumed his office. On the 21st of February foU
lowiiie the President again removed Stanton,
but, supported by a resolution of the Senate,
Stantou refused to surrender the office to-Gen
eral Lorenzo Thomas, who had been appointed
by the President. The House of Representa
tives or. the 24th of February passed a resolu
tion for the impeaenment of the Presi
dent by a vote of 12G ayes and 47 noes,
17 not voting, George S. Boutweil aud
Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts, Jonn
A. Bingham of Ohio, James F. Wilson
of lowa, Thomas Williams and Thaddeus
Stevens ol Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of
Illinois to conduct the prosecution. The Presi
dent was represented by the following coun
sel: Henry Stanbery and W. S. Groesbeck of
Ohio, W illiam M. Evart* of New York, Thomas
A. R. Nelson of Tennessee and Benjamin R.
Curtis of Massachusetts. The artici.es of im
peachment, eleven in number, were presented
to the Senate March 5. In brief, these charged
that the President, in the removal of Stanton,
had violated the tenure of office act: that he
had been guilty of intimidating Stanton and
had conspired with Thomas toseize unlawfully
the property and money of the War Depart
ment, and that he had been guilty of contempt
in declaring that the thirty-ninth Congress was
not a legally constitu ted body, and that he had
failed to proper execute Its acts. On the day
named the Senate as a court, Chief Justice
Salmon P. Chase presiding, commenced a trial.
Testimony was first tuken on the 30th of the
month and continued until Ai>rll 20, and on
May 6 arguments were closed. On tne 16th of
May a vote was taken on the article charging
Johnson with contempt of Congress and its
acts. The vote was 35 for conviction and lg
for acquittal, being one short of the two-thirds
vote necassary to convict. Seven Republicans
voted with the twelve Democrats. On the
26th of May, by the same vote, Johnson was
acquitted of the charge of violating the tenure
of office act. No vote was taken on the other
articles, and by direction of Chief Justice
Chase a verdict of acquittal was entered.

SHIPS IS PORT
Terrible Experience of the
Dominion and Neder
lands.
CATJGET OFF CAPE HOBN
The Dominion Battled for Sixty
Days to Get Into the
Pacific.
ARRIVAL OF IHE MARIPOSA.
Actors and Millions of Gold Sover
eigns on the Same Vessel.
A Queer Fish.
Of all the vessels that have come into
port during the past month, the most
unfortunate has been the British ship
Dominion. She made an unusually long
passage, and in spite of the best of sea
manship the good ship could do but little
against the terrible storms off Cape Horn.
Forcine against the winds trom 30 in the
Atlantic to 40 in the Pacific took sixty
days, and when Captain Cooper came in
and reported a run of eleven days from
60 to 50. made by the Royal Forth, Captain
Meredith was chagrined.
The Dominion is one of the handsomest
ships in port and has made quick passages,
She and the Nation and Republic were
built about five years ago and were won
derfully successful vessels until this year.
The Republic was burned on a voyage to
San Francisco and the Dominion made an
unusually long trip to this port. It was
not the fault of the master, however, as
Captain Meredith is one of the most skill
ful skippers that comes to San Francisco,
He is a master carpenter and an artist of
no mean ability.
In consequence the Dominion is adorned
with many nicnacs and many oil paint
ings. The accompanying sketch is made
from a drawing by Captain Meredith. For
days and days tne ship was hove to under
a goose-winged lower main topsail and
not a mile of headway could be made.
The seas rode mountains high and the
galley fire was kept going from morning
till night to keep the coffeepot boiling for
the men, who were almost freezing to the
braces. Two boats were washed away
and other damage done, but in spite of
her rough experience the Dominion looks
one of the smartest vessels in port.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Mariposa got in from Australia yesterday.
Tne steerage passengers were all rigidly
examined by Drs. Chalmers and Blue and
everybody had to show his or her ready
cash. Mrs. Crisp and Mrs. Martin are on
their way to Flor.da, where the latter
owns a ranch, and they surprised the im
migration commissioners by producing
$15,000 between them.
The cabin passengers were:
From Sydneyâ F! Lloyd, H. Wogtenholms, A.
Lysaght and wife, Thomas Elliott, W. Knapp,
H. Milford, Mrs. A. Myers and son, J. Vander
velde, L. V'andervelde, Mrs. E. Smith, Mrs. BÂ»

Garvin and wife, E. Bishop, A. Hartwell, Miss
Hardy and E. Waterhouse.
Blanche Walsh, who left here on the
Mouowai, laughs at the idea of leaving
Nat Goodwin's Company on account of
divorce proceedings, and asserts that there
was only room for one leading lady and
that she did not desire to^hare the honors
with Miss Maxine Elliott. Since Mis 3
Walsh has been in Australia the southern
aun has changed the color of her hair from
a brown to the color of burnished bronze.
The Trilby Company came back after a
most successful season. "They made things
pleasant during the trip over, and MiÂ«
Eiiith Crane, Miss Emma Cleveland,
Charley Canfield -and G. M. Welty were
the life ana soul of every party got up
aboard.
Dr. Sollas, a scientist who has been in
vestigating the coral reefs of the South
Seas, also returned. He says that a!l the
if lands are built on a Hand strata and are
liable to go down at any time, particularly
if a violent volcanic disturbance takes
place. Ke was puzzled over a strange
little ocean wanderer that came aboard
the Mariposa. It was on the 7th inst. in
Jatitude24 deg. 19 mm. north, longitude
175 de<_'. 18 mm. west and at 1:30 p. m.
when Dr. L. K. Riley .discovered the hsh,
still alive. A wave carried it aboard, and
now it remains to be seen what family it
belongs to. Dr. Riley has forwarded the
little wanderer to the Academy of Sciences
for classification, or if it be a stranger to
science to call it Rileyensis.
The Maiiposa brought one of the most
valuable cargoes that ever reached San
Francisco into port yesterday. Among it
was 85 boxes of English sovereigns, valued
at $2,125,000. Of these 45 boxes went to
the Anglo-Californian Bank and 40 boxes
to the London fend Paris Hank. All this
gold will be turned over to the mint and
recoined into good American $20 gold
pieces. Great quantities of wheat have
been shipped from here to Australia, and
in consequence the balance of trade b.is
been greatly against that country. Hence
the shipments of gold to San Francisco.
Two wel -bred horses came over on the
steamer. Tlie owners will not eive th- ir
names, as they want to enter them in the
race meeting to be held at Ingleside. One
of the horse* is known to be Disparity, a
mare that ran second in the Melbourne
cup two years ago. She is wonderfully
quick over a short distance.
Word came by the Mariposa that the
Union Steamship Company's new steamer,
to replace the Monowai, will sail from
Sydney, > T . S. W., on the March run. She
will be a t>pieudidly appointed vessel, Â»ad

according to contract must make fourteen
knots with a dead weight in her holds of
3700 tons. The Rakanoa, n freightboat
built for the same line, was in Sydney
when the Mariposa sailed. S?he had a car
rying capacity of 5000 tons.
Three carloads of ireight for Fresno, via
the Valley road, left for Stockton on the
steamer T. C. Walker yesterday. Two car
loads were for KuttnVr, Goldstein & Co.
and one for "Wellinan, Peck <fc Co-.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday and awarded space to
Twisrg & Sons, the boat-builders, near the
Union iron Works, and to I'arby L.eydon
& Co. for unloading piles near Meiggs
wharf. The changes in the new ferry de
pot were again under discussion and Mr.
Moore of the Risdon Iron Works made a
number of aemands. No decision was
reached, and tne matter will come up
aprain noxt Tuesday.
The Martha Tufts and La Gerond are on
the Merchants' drydock being painted,

at one time.
Captain Paulson of the brig Geneva is a
very sick man. and has been compelled to

The British ship Pytliomere, which ar
rived yesterday from the Mauritius, re
ports the loss of one of the crew. Henry
B. Moyniehan fell from aloit on August
13 and died two days later from his inju
ries. He was only 18 years of age, and it
was his first voyage to sea.
The Dutch ship NederlanU, which ar
rived yesterday, had a terrible time of it
rounding tne Horn. She was caught in
the same gales that nearly wrecked the
Dominion and had to put into Port Stan
ley for repairs. Backstays nnd' lashings
were burst like pacii thread, sails were
blown out of the bolt ropes, lifeboats were
smashed into kindling wood and the port
rail was under water nearly all the time.
Eleven of the crew were laid" up from ex
posure and, over 100 tons of cargo had
to be jettisoned. New sails wore bent and
the rigging repaired, and the Nederland
finally reached port.
SORRY HE DID NOT DIE
Philip Phillips, Forester ard
Tailor, Has Completely
Recovered.
He Gives His Reasons fcr Courting
Death, but Will Not Tempt It
Again.
Philip .Phillips, the tailor at 7 Eddy
street, who made such careful prepara
tions ior death on Wednesday, had com
pletely recovered yesterday from the effects
of- the chloroform he had swallowed.
Attorney Nagle and other member of
the Ancient Order of Foresters visited
him at the Receiving Hospital yesterday
and assured him that bis deficiency to
Court Washington, of which be was treas
urer, would be made good.
Phillips expressed his regret that he was
not allowed to die. When asked if he
would make another attempt lie hesitated
and finally said he did not tuint be would.
"I am 58 years of ape," he paid, "and
have bad so many troubles in my life
throriL'h bearing the misfortunes of others
that lam tired of life. My life is insured
for $4000, and that would keep my wife
and daughter from starving after lam
gone.
"I swallowed three ounces of chloro
i form. The bottle was left in my shop
about six months ago by a .young man
who wanted his trousers cleaned with it.
But I did not want to use it. That was all
the poison 1 took, but thought it would be
enough.
"I went to the Surety Company myself
and told them of my shortage, wnich is
only $100. My assets are far in excess of
my debts and I had no fear that the short- I
age would not be paid.
"It is true I was convicted of arson, but
it is also true that I was innocent and
there are several people who can prove it.
That is why Governor Haight pardoned
me. I was then running a saloon on
Commercial and Battery streets and was
a young man without any incuniDrance.
My partner, Josh Davis, was a married
man with a large family. The fire oc
curred in the saloon while I was in bed
after attendine a Masonic meeting and I
thought it was better for me to suffer than
mr partner, who bad so much depending
unon him. 1 '
.Phillips reiterated the charges he made
against a well-known rabbi in his letters
to the Coroner and said be would yet
prove them.
More people speak English than Rus
sian, French and German put together.

scious. She had come in some hours be
fore and hired a room.
In explaining matters Walter Campbell,
who spoke with the authority of the girl's
mother, said:
"Bhe left home at 2:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon to cash a $200 check at the First
National Bank. This is her monthly al
lowance from her father, and as usual she
drew the money and deposited it in the
safe deposit vaalt, where her mother has a
box.
''Prior to leaving home she took with
her a small vial of what she believed to
be cough medicine, and as she was leaving
the vault she swallowed a mouthful of the
drug to avert a threatening attack of
couching.
"Walking tip Market street she felt a
great decree of dizziness and nausea.
There was no drugstore nor other handy
place in which she could sees shelter and
she observed the lodging-house called the
Mascot. Into this place she repaired and
told the landlady she was ill and wished
to lie down a little while. She was shown
to a room, where she was subsequently
found dying."
Dr. Bertram F. Alden, the family physi
cian, was by Miss Clark's bedsiue last
night, and he unhesitatingly stated she
would recover.
"I have been treating her for a clogging
of the left lung during the past two years.
She has been progressing quite well, but
she is still a delicate girl. I know notti
ing of the cause of her present trouble,
and accept her mother's statement of the
affair as the truth. 1 '
The young girl, herself, says that no
man bad been with her or bad taken her
away from home. She did not remember
that she ever said, "He told me to go to
the devil, and I tried to go."

MAY CONTINUE BUSINESS
The Creditors of O'Connell &
Lewis' Iron Works Hold
a Meeting.
Employes Refused to Work â The
Nominal Assets Greatly Exceed
the Liabilities
A meeting of the creditors of O'Connell
& Lewis, boiler, machine works and iron
founders at Francisco and Kearny streets,
was held yesterday in the office of Stafford
& Stafford, attorneys for the firm. It was
called by Messers. O'Connell and Stafford,
and the question of continuing or discon
tinuing the business of the firm was con
sidered. The liabilities are said to be $50,
-000 and the assets $90,000, including $10,
-000 in contracts and outstanding accounts,
the machinery and the real estate of the
iron works. The necessity of a meeting
of the creditors was caused by the general
depression of business and inability to
realize on accounts.
The firm is behind in payment of wages
to its employes, and the tumble was pre
cipitated by the employes refusing to go
to work last Saturday unless they were
paid.
It was represented on behalf of the firm
that they thought they could pay their
liabilities, cr the largest part of them, in
six months or a year, and that much ex
tension of time was asked.
The creditors appointed a committee to
examine into the books and accounts of

RACING EVENTS
AT STOCKTON
Auditor's Admirers Lose
Heavily on Him, but
Win on Bastina.
LOUPE PLUCKS HONORS.
Paces the Fastest Heats Ever
Traveled Over the Stockton
Courses.
PICKPOCKETS COME TO GRIEF.
Weather Is Warmer and Visitors
From Sacramento Help Swell
the Crowd.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 24.â 1t is said
wine ripens with age. and as the fair
progresses the crowd continues to increase
in sire. To-day the largest crowd of the
week saw some good, clean sport in nearly
every instance. The infield was well
populated to-day with vehicles of differ
ent descriptions, and a delegation of
Sacramentans helped swell the number of
spectators in the grand stand.
The thermometer took a startling up
ward jump. The horses seem to enjoy
the change if the public did not. A num
ber of pickpockets, posing as touts, did a
thriving business. One or two who were
luckless enough to fall into the clutches
of the law through their clumsiness bid
fair to become wards of the State for some
time to come.
Auditor, favorite for the 2:24 trot, dis
appointed his admirers, who fell heavily
by his downfall, but they pulled out by
backing Bastina, favorite for the 2:27
pace, and Rebellion, first in demand for
the mile handicap.
The unfinished 2:13 pace was the first
event called. Loupe, with two heats
to his credit, raced with Del Norte
to the homestretch, when he drew away
and won cleverly in 2:10%, thus winning,
the honor of having been the victorious
contestant in the fastests heats ever trav
eled over the Stockton circular or kite
courses.
Driver Joe Edge's horse Auditor was
considered quite the fashionable thine for
the 2:24 trot, and hit friends jumped
aboard, bidding $30 for the son of Secre
tary to $10 for the sturdy looking Addison
and $7 for Alias. Auditor was not up to a
hard race, and Addison, skillfully piloted
by Nelson, got away with the race in
straight heats in 2:19â 2:19â 2:21^. Audi
tor, who was driven by "Jimmy" Sullivan
after the first heat on account of the ill
ness of Mr. Edge, earned second money by
finishing second in two heats.
The 2:27 pace was somewhat tame.
Bastina, driven by his owner, M. M. John
son, brought $10 in the auction pools, with
the entire fieid, consisting of Prince H,
Butch, Rex Alto and Munvon, bringing
but $10. Bastina held a iead of a few sec
onds and finished before the field in
straight heats. Time, 2:19â 2:19â 2: 22Â»Â£.
Prince H, driven to the best advantage by
F. Haney, took second money.
Six accepted the weights in the mile
handicap. Rebellion, with 104 pounds up,
had a strong following, the big players
bidding $25 for him, with Miss Pollard
bringing $11 and the field $10. Shepard
either intentionally or unintentionally
yanked Miss Pollard up at the start and
she was left. At any rate the right sort of
coin did not go in on Burlingame's mare.
Trix evidently was the only one trying
outside of the favorite, and she beaded the
field to the stretch. Here Martin, on the
first choice, by some judicious riding over
hauled the outsider, and, in a drive, won
by three parts of a length from Favory,
who, after'running a strong half, fell back
and then came strong again at the finish.
The mile was covered in 1:41%.

Latest A. card*.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 24.â During the
forenoon and afternoon the balance of
the awards made to the dogs entered in the
Steckton Bench Show were made by J. Otis
Fellows, the judge.
To-nieht the space allotted to the bench
show in the pavilion was so crowded that
there was hardly room for the spectators to
move about in the aisles.

will continue until Saturday night, and
will probably draw a larger crowd every
night. It is the most successful affair ever
undertaken in the pavilion by the fair

LIVELY INTEREST OF CC-EDS
Features of the Gameâ Kickers and
Punters Entitled tc Honorable
Mention.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
24.â The first football game of this season
between rival classes was played to-day
between the freshman eleven and the
juniors. Tt ended 6âo in favor of the
freshmen. Unfortunately several of the
best players of both teams were on the
"repair list," having been laid up at
recent practice games, o â¢ being in such
poor condition that they were unequal to
their usual good game. Madden, James,
Soper and Seawright were all playing with
bruises and strains more or lees severe.
Great interest was taken in the game, it
being the first opportunity for judging of
the strength of the freshmen as a team,
and it being the first game of the season
among the class teams.
A large number of spectators were out to
witness the play, fully 500 students being
on hand when time was called. A large
number of these weie co-eds, who are tak
ing an unusual interest in the game this
year and are regular attendants on the
side-lines. Partisans of both classes were
on hand in noisy numbers, and the rival
yells of the classes kept the crowds ex
cited even when the play was uninterest
ing.
The teams lined up at 4 o'clock as fol
lows:
'98 team. Positions. '00 team.

The juniors took the ball first, and
Carle kicked for 40 yards. Diggler got
the ball ana plunged down the iieul for
20 yards before being downed. Rusk
bucked for 10 yards, and the freshmen
cheered themselves hoarse. Lanagan
kicked for 35 yards and the freshmen got
the ball, but immediately lost it.
The first try of the juniors resulted in
no gain. Then Dole made 6 yards and
the freshmen got the bail on a fumble.
Lanagan kicked for 30 yards. Burtin '
stopped Dole from making any gtiin, but
immediately after Dole made a 6-yard
end run. Fisher bucked for 3 yards,
and Fickert made no gain, being tackled
by Balentine. Dole struck the line for
3 yards, ana Carle bit right tackle for
6 yards more, which Fisher soon made 10.
Carle, Fisner and Fickert each made short
gains, and 1900 got possession of the pig
skin.
Lanagan immediately punted for 36
yards and '98 took the ball, but lost 20
yards on a bad pass to Dole, who fumbled.
Dote tried auotner kick and ina<le 15 yards,
Fic&ert failing on the ball. Dole kicked
again and Cuthbertson made a long run
to the '98's five-yard line before being
tackled. A buck by 1900 followed with no
gain. The ball was then passed to Diggler,
who made a tine end run with Murphy's
interference, and a touch down waÃ re
corded. Murphy kicked the goal. Score,
6 â o in favor of the freshmen.
The ball was taken back to the center of
the field and Carle kicked off for thirty
yards. Balentine got the ball and brought
it back 12 yards. Lanagan punted for 40
yards and Dole ran ii back 10 yards.
Dole, Fisher, Carle and Fickert made an
aggregate of 15 yards by bucking and the
first half ended.
In the second 1900 took the ball and
Murphy opened up with a long punt,
which Dole returned. The freshmen, made
no gain by bucking, but Diggler's run and
Lanagan's punts kept the ball in '98's ter
ritory throughout the half.
Diggler and Murphy especially distin
guished themselves by long-end mn*. The
game ended with the ball on 'sÂ»s'sÂ» ten-yard
line.
The features of the game were Cuthbert
son's strong showing a.ainst Fickert,
whom every one expected to see walk
through the freshman line; but his
doughty little opponent showed he had no
end of grit and understood hi 3 position.
Lanagan punted in fine siyie for the
freshmen and Rusk, at tackle, at times had
things his own way with Harrington, who,
however, is not a tackle, but a guard, and
was comparatively new to nis position.
Dole and Fisher did the best work for
'98.

MONTEREY TANBARK INDUSTRY.
An Enterprising San Jose Firm Secures a
Monopoly and /s Doing a Thriv
ing Business.
MONTEREY, Cal., Sspt. 24. â The
schooner Bessie X., Captain Andersen,
took 118 tons of tanbark from Notley
Bros. 1 landing, a cove about thirty-eight
miles down the coast from here, to Aiviso.
The bark^was consigned to Notley Bros.,
San Jose. This last shipment completes
an order of 500 tons, part of which was
shipped by rail from this place. This
firm commenced operations in this locality
in the summer of last year as a venture
and cleaned out in four months' time
about 1200 cords of wood, from which they
peeled the bark. The bark had to be
hauled by six-horse teams for forty miles
over the roughest road in the State up the
coast to this place, where it was shipped
Dv rail to San Francisco and San Jose.
Finding ready sale for the bark, how
ever, Notley Bros, increased their forces
this year and moved farther back in the
mountains, where the bar* was more
plentiful. This year they have already
cut about 3000 cords and will continue
workine for several months yet, having
found a landing-place about due west from
the seine of operations where small
schooners could anchor and take on car
goes safejy, which materially assisted
them in shipping. The country in which
the choppers are now at work is altogether
inaccessible to teams, and all provisions
have to be carried in and all bark has to
be brought out on pack mules. The bark
when brought to the summit of the
mountain is bundled up and slides down
the mountain side in a flume tb the land
ing on the coast.
FATAL LEAP FROM A CAR
Mrs. Kate Taber, or Tahey, of
San Francisco Meets an
Awful Death.
Was on Her Way to Butte, Montana,
and Is Supposed to Have Be
come Insane.
PORTLAND, Ob., Sept. 24.â General
Passenger Agent W. H. Hurlburt last
night received a brief dispatch from his
agent at Wallula to the effect that an un
known woman, holding a ticket from San
Francisco to Butte, Mont., had jumped
from a tourist-car on the O. R. and N.
Railway while the train was in motion,
near Wallula, and received injuries from
which she shortly after died. The act was
either a suicidal one, or committed while
the woman was laboring under an insane
spell.
The information telegraphed to Mr.
Huriburt was of the most meager kind,
with nothing in the way of description
from which to identify the unfortunate
woman, beyond her own signatuie to her
ticket, which is not very clear, and reads
either "Mrs. Kate Taber" or "Mrs. Kate
Tahey."
The woman was on the train that left
Portland at 7 o'clock Tuesday evening,
and she jumped from the train about 2
o'clock yesterday morning. When the
train backed up to where sne lay she was
iound unconscious, with her face badly
bruised and one arm broken. She was
| placed on the train and taken to Wallula,
I and left there for medical attention. She
I never recovered consciousness, ana died
shortly after, leaving the mystery as to
| her identity or cause for the fatal leap
I deeper thau ever.
FRESNO FIREBUGS QUARRED
Conversation Overheard by a Lady Con
aidrred of Great importance.
FRESNO. Cal , Sept. 24.â Mrs. John W.
Lambert, whose husband was acquitted of
a charge of murder yesterday, stood about
11 o'clock last night in her front yard and
overheard the conversation of two men,
one of whom was threatening to inform
the authorities on some one who had been
the cause of the fires which destroyed the
Baptist and Presbyterian churches in this
city within the past few weeks. The other
fellow was trying to dissuade him from
carrying out his threat. The two men
were standing under a tree, d short dis
tance from the Lambert house, and they
aid not see Mrs. Lambert, who was await
ing the return of her husband from up
town. .
Mrs. Lambert thinks that the man who
made the threats to inform on some third
party was under the influence of liquor,
judging from the manner of his conver
sation. He said that this party had
wronged him, and that he was "bound to
get even by sending him to the pen."
T. G. Hart, Chief of the Fire Department,
considers Mrs. Lambert's information
very valuable for the reason that he be
lieves it confirms the theory he has held
that the destruction of the churches was
of incendiary origin. He has been totally
unable thus far, however, to obtain any
clew as to the guilty party. He hopes To
work something out of what Mrs. Lam
bert heard last night.

clet on the Coast.
SPOKANE. Wash., Sept 24.â Ed Boyce,

with the mining riots, is president of the
Northwest Miners' Union, with Head
quarters at Wallace, Idaho. During the
great strikes in the Cceur d'Alene mining

of the leaders of the miners' union, and
has been regarded as their head and
leader ever since. He has been prominent
in politics in that State, and was in control
at the late Populist convention at Boise.
He has been mentioned' by some of the
laboring men for the Senate, but i 3 not re
garded as a serious candidate by leading
men of Idaho. He is said to have great

even intimated that when he went to
Leadville he knew what was going to
happen.

Cator's Vigorous Speech Against a
Clause Exempting All bat
Bryanites. â  .
The Populists met in convention at their
tent last night and held a meeting that at
times approached bedlam. The delegates
were augry at being "turned down" by
the Raineyites in their efforts for a fusion,
and meant to make a straight nomination.
A factional fight, however, prevented this,
and all that was done was to suggest men
for the various offices, on whom the com
mittee of investigation, which meets at
noon to-day, will report.
Following are the men suggested as can
didates:
Mayorâ Dr. Jerome A. Anderson and Super
visor Joe Dimond. Supervisorsâ Twelfth Ward,
Adolph Sutro; Eleventh Ward, D. C. Todd, ki.
H. BaumelBter, James E. Britt; Tenth Ward,

Henry Doscher. Surveyorâ John C. Bun
ner. Superintendent of Streetsâ James W.
Keay, D. A. McDonald. Superior Judges â
Frank H. Dunne, Robert Ferral, Horace W.
Philbrook. Joseph Leggett, J. C. B. Hebbard.
Police Judgesâ James A. Campbell. Charles T.
Conlan, Walter Gallagher, William J. Gavigan.
George W. Fox, J. A. Spinettl.
Taylor Rogers was the first man named
for Mayor ana was mentioned by Attor
ney Haskell. He declined the nomina
tion and ended by naming Anderson.
The meeting was called to order by a
reading of the report of the committee on
resolutions by Rogers, chairman. Its
principal recommenaations were:
That the Board of Supervisors shall, as a
Board of Equalization, so correct the assess
ments upon taxable property that the appor
tionment against the banks, millionaires and
corporations shall be to its full cash value as
directed by the constitution.
The fees of the City and County Surveyor
and shorthand reporters should be reduced.
Water rates should be reduced, pending the
submission of the question of public owner
ship, which should be submitted to the people
at the earliest possible moment.
Btreet railroads should be compelled to re
pair between track* as agreed upon.
We iavor the passage of a bill increasing the
powers and facilities of the State Bureau of
Highways.
The Legislature should declare the bicycle
to be baggage.
We favor the repaying of Market street wtth
a smooth and modern pavement; also the
lighting with electricity of Golden Gate Park
and the removal from our streets of unused
and abandoned rails of streetcar companies.
The conference committee reported to
the effect that as the Raineyites had not
seen fit to appoint a committee to confer
on fusion, the body proceed to nominate
its own men, candidates being only
Bryanists. It was carried|unanimously.
Cator made a speech against the exemp
tion clause in favor of judicial nominees,
and the clause was amended to include all
candidates.
The convention decided to get a picture
of Watson, to adorn the chairman's plat
iorm alongside of Bryan's picture.
It was noted that a joint committee of
the Populists of Marin and Contra Costa
counties met at 6 Sacramento street yes
terday and indorsed the nomination of C.
F. Montgomery as Senator from the
Eleventh Senatoral District.
The convention then "took a recess" till
8 p. m. Monday.

SHE WILL BE A
SOLDIER'S BRIDE
Miss Alice McCrea and
Lieutenant John Joyce
to Wed.
SHE IS AN ARMY BELLE
The Groom a Popular Officer of
the Gallant Fifth Ar
tillery.
INSTRUCTOR AT WEST POINT.
The News of the Engagement Comes
With the Tidings of the Trans
fer of the Fifth.
Army circles and society at large as
well are more than usually interested in
the announcement of the engagement of
Miss Alice McCrea, only daughter of
Major McCrea, the gallant senior major of
the Fifth Artillery, and Lieutenant Joyce,
also of the Fifth. The engagement, to
gether with the news of the transfer of the
Fifth Artillery to New York, were the
main topics of conversation at the Presidio
yesterday.
The bride-to-be is a reigning belle in ex
clusive army circles. To her nature has
been more than lavish. Endowed with
rare personal beauty, she is gifted as an
artist, and possesses a contralto voice of
exquisite sweetness and rich quality.
Miss McCrea is a member of the Art
Student League of New York and the
Hopkins Art School of this City. Devoted
as she is to her art studies she has never
theless found time fur out-of-door amuse
ments, and is a graceful rider and swim
mer.
Lieutenant Joyce has recently been
transferred from the Presidio to West
Point, where he is an instructor in the
military academy of that post. He gradu
ated from West Point with high honors in
'93 and was immediately assigned to duty
at the Presidio. During his stay in this
City he was a general favorite with his
comrades, commanding officers and in
social circles.
The wedding of Miss McCrea and Lieu
tenant Joyce will probably not take place
until next June. It will be celebrated at
West Point, which, by the way, is the
birthplace of the charming bride, and
there the young couple will make their
future home.

HIS LIFE WORK
Funeral of Rev. M. F. Col
burn of the Grace M.
E. Church.
THRONGS OF MOURNERS
Fraternal Societies and Church
Organizations Were
Present.
SEVERAL PREACHERS SPOKE.
He Fought the Good Fight, They Said,
and He Is Beyond the Reach
of Calumny.
A large concourse of mourners attended
the funeral services of the late pastor of
ihe Grace M. E. Church, Key. M. F. Col
burn, yesterday afternoon. Many Metho
dist clergymen were there.
A delegation from the Masonic board of
relief, Excelsior Lodge of Odd Fellows and
the members of the Boys' Brigade con
nected with the church occupied a body
of seats reserved for them. The entire
seating and standing capacity of the floor
and galleries of the auditorium was not
sufficient to accommodate all, and the
stairs from the floor to the galleries were
also crowded.
The front of the church was draped
somberly with black. The front of the
choir loft and the reading-uesk also bore
emblems of mourning. Near the casket
were many floral pieces, among which
were a large broken wheel from Excelsior
Lodge, I. O. O. F., Maltese crosses from
the Epworth League and King's Daugh
ters, a broken column from Emmanuel
Baptist Church, a chair bearing the words
"Home, bweet Home," a violet wreath
from the King's Daugjitersandan uDright
cross from the Boys' Brigade, with smaller
wreaths and other designs, among; them a
basket of white roses from the Methodist
church in San Diego of which Rev. Mr.
Coiburn was formerly the pabtor.
Rev. Dr. Coyle, presiding elder of the
district, directed the exercises, wnich
were opened with prayer by Rev. Dr.
Jewell. Rev. Dr. Heacock read a selec
tion from the Bible and tnen Rev. Dr.
Covle. Rev. Dr. Harris, the Japanese mis
sionary, I. J. Truman, Rev. Dr. McClish
and Rev. Dr. Dille spoke.
Rev. Dr. Coyle said that the memory of
the dead preacher will remain long after
his body has crumbled to dust and spoke
feelingly of his life and work in the
church.
I. J. Truman said that the dead pastor
had been highly beloved for his work. He
was a great friend to the Boys' Brigade of
the church and had entertained many
plans for its advancement and good. In
recent troubles Rev. Mr. Coiburn highly
appreciated the stand which Grace Churcn
toot. Grace Church never had any doubt
concerning its pastor. There was never a
truer man than he in every sense of the
word.
Rev. Dr. McClish said that he could not
think of Rev. Mr. Coiburn as dead. He
knew of the love of his congregation. Rev.
Dr. McClish spoke at length, alluding to
the education and culture of the preactier.
"His people loved him and his church
stood by him," said the speaker. "He has
won the crown of victory."
Dr. McClish said also: "He is where the
sound of the tongue of calumny cannot
reach him; where the pen of defamation
cannot make a mark on his white gar
ment."
Rev. Dr. Dille said the dead preacher
would be mourned in one thousand house
holds outside of San Francisco. Rev. Mr.
Coiburn, he said, fouirht the good fight.
The venomous shafts of slander and the
arrows of calumny fell, harmless, at his
feet. His deatn left a real vacancy in the
church. His ministry was crowned with
success.
The choir sang a hymn with organ
accompaniment and the mourners tnen
vassed by the open casket, first the Free
Masons, then the Odd Fellows and then
the members oi the various societies con
nected with the church and congregation.
The casket bore only the name of the dead
preacner, the date of his death, September
22, 1896, and his age, 44 years 6 months and
13 days.
The procession was in the following
order:
Masonic Board of relief, Excelsior Lodge.
I. O. O. F.. Boys' Brigade, official board of
(â¢race Churcn, " Ladies' Aid Society, King's
Daughters, Ladies' Aid Society of the Eighth
avenue M. K. Church of East Oakland, Ep
â \vorth League and Methodist clergy.
The societies all marched down Capp
street to Eighteenth and out to Guerrero.
The pallbearers were: Rev. Dr. F. D.
Bovard, Rev. Dr. E. R. Willis, Rev. P. K.
Baker, Rev. Dr. F. F. Jeweil, Rev. W. S.

by tne Odd Fellows, and the Masonic
quartet sang a parting hymn.
STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY.
Mrs. Laura Blair Found Unconscious in
a Bathtub.
Mrs. Laura Blair, a widow, living at 224
Capp street, went to the Crystal baths,
foot of Powell street, yesterday morning
and said she wanted to take a very warm
bath, as she was suffering from poison oak.
She was shown into one of the rooms
and about half an hour later one of the at
tendants was attracted by heavy breath
ing coming from her room. The door was
opened and she was found unconscious in
the bathtub. She bad taken the precau
tion to fasten the strap across the tub and
her bead was resting upon it, which kept
it out of the water and saved her from
drowning.
She was taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal in the ambulance and it was thought
she bad been seized with a stroke of apo
plexy. She regained consciousness for a
minutes last evening, but again lapsed
into her former state.
Complain Against the Captain.
The crew of the whaiing vesÂ«el J. D. Peters
made complaint yesterday to United States
Commissioner Gwin to the effect that during
the recent voyage their captain had subjected
them to all manner of indignities. The princi
pal grievance, however, was in the prices
charged for the necessities of life. In some
instances the men say Captain Townsend
charged 25 cents lor clay pipe* that couid be
bought anywhere for 5 and 10 cents. Other
articles were also outrageously high. The
captain denies all this and say* that he treated
his men better than they deserved.

Vain Attempt or Attorney Collins to
Secure His Client's Release on
Kail.
Unless something not now down on the
programme occurs Dick WilliamÃ, the ex-
Chinese inspector, will be in*Â°San Quentin
by 11 o'clock this morninc
Attorney George D. Collins made a good
fight for his client's liberty, even offering
a full confession implicating "others high
in power," but the plan would not work.
Williams wanted tirst his liberty and
then he would tell all he knew, but the
officers woutd not accept such conditions.
About 4 o'clock Mr. Collins visited Dis
trict Attorney Foote and asked his con
sent for bail, saying that Williams would
place documentary evidence in his posses
sion which would result in bringing about
the conviction of persons high in
authority.
"lam not making terms with convicts,"
answered the .District Attorney. "If Wil
liams has anything to offer the Govern
ment bring it here. The Government is
not seeking any testimony that is not vol
untary."
Finally it was agreed that Marshal
Baldwin should take Williams to the
place or places where the documentary
evidence was supposed to be, and then re
turn the prisoner to the County Jail; that
Mr. Collins would get the evidence from
Williams and submit it to Mr. Foote.
Thereupon the District Attorney, Assist
ant Attorney Schlessinger, Major Moore
and Mr. Cbanning clothed themselves
with patience and awaited developments.
The developments were long in coming,
for Williams declined to treat with the
D;strict Attorney. He said he would only
speak to Judge Morrow.
It was 8 o'clock when the conference ad
journed, the general impression being that
Wiliiams is not in possession of any in
criminating evidence, and that his pre
tended "confession" was a bluff to secure
bail, and then disappear.
CUPS FOB FIRE HORSES,
The Fireman's Fund Insurance
Company Gives a Fine
Trophy.
The Horse Show Association Also
G-'ts a Cup From J:seph
D. Grant.
The Horse Show Association is trying
to get a regular display of Fire Depart
ment horses for the third annual show in
December, and it is expected that two
silver cups, which have just bten added
The Fireman's Fund Insurance Cup and the Joseph D. Grant Cup.
to the prize list, will have the effect of
stirring up Fire Department ambition all
over the coast.
The Fireman's Fund Insurance Com
pany has just offered a handsome silver
cup for the best pair of Fire Department
horses, and Joseph D. Grant has offered a
fine silver cud for the best team of three
Fire Department horses.
Most of the cities on the Pacific Coast
will be requested by letter to compete,
and it is expected that a number of them
will respond, particularly the places
where tne citizens take a personal pride
in the efficiency of their Fire Department.
Eureka has a new department, which
has several times lately paraded to the
admiration of distinguished visitors;
Fresno has some Fire Department horses
which are the pride of the town, and it is
very likely that a pair of them will be
sent to the Horse Show; Sacramento is
almost sure to compete; so is Oakland.
Tacotna has a beautiful team of two
black horses and one white which are
almost promised, and other fire depart
ments have also implied that they will
compete.
In order to lessen the expense for fire
departments from a distance Chief Sulli
van has promised to lend all the appar
atus necessary for exhibiting visiting
horses with a fire engine, and the railroads
are transporting all the competing horses
at half rates.
Another exhibition that promises to be
a feature of the coming horse ?h Â»w is the
parade of delivery vans. Milk wagons,
laundry carts and all sorts of advertising
turnouts will be admitted, and it is ex
pected that the crush will be so great that
ail the carts will never be able to get into
the arena at the same time.
He Kelt Called and Went.
James L. Case, a young man well Known in
insurance and reliaioua circles and a broker
for several years with the local agency of tho
Royal Insurance Company, has resigned his
poiition and accepted a call to the ministry.
Mr. Case has been prominent In Sunday-school
work in San Francisco and secretary of the
Lay Association ot the Methodist conference
several years. He attended the recent confer
ence at Pacific (irove, and waÂ« more than ever
impressed with the call io the ministry, which,
he says, he had resisted several years. The
day after conference adjourned he conferred
with Rev. 8. G. Gale, the new presiding elder
of the Napa district, and the result waÃ that
he was offered and accepted the charge at
Guinda and Madisou, In Yolo County. He
preached there last Sunday the first time. He
is a son of Rev. Dr. W. W. Case, pastor of the
Howard-street Methodist Church.

fies Hog-Ranchers
to Move.
NEW LIMITS CREATED.
Delay in Obeying tne Order Will
Lead to Condemnation
Proceedings.
GIVEN SIX MONTHS TO VACATF
Residents of Cutside Districts Will
Receive a Long-Awaited
Boon
The six months allowed the bog-ranchers
whese places are within the "present hog
limits by the Board of Supervisors in
which to find new locations and move to
them expire on Wednesday next, and no
tices were sent to them by the Board of
Health Wednesday that no further time
will be granted and that they must move
at once.
The fight against the ranchers was be
gun about a year ago, when the inhabi
tants of several districts where the swine
raisers were particularly abundant peti
tioned the Board of Health and Board of
Supervisors to have the limits so extended
as to prevent hog-raising within thickly
populated localities.
The Board of Health petitioned the
Board of Supervisors to pass an ordinance
removing the ranchers at once, but the
friends of the ranchers in the board, on
the plea that to hunt new locations and
move at once would be a great hardship,
prevented such action and the following
was passed :
Section 63, subdivision 1. Xo person or per
sons shall keep or cause to be kept any swine
whatsoever within that portion of the City
and County of Sau Francisco bounded as fol
lows: commencing Â«t the point where Fullou
street would, it projected westerly, meet the

along the waters of the bay to the Pacific
Ocean, thence along the waters of the Pacific
Ocean to the point of commencement; pro
vided, that this subdivision shall not go into
force or effect until the first day of October,
1806.
The notices that were sent to twenty
five or more ranchers yesterday we're
short and to the point, simply calling at
tention to the action of the Board of Su
pervisors and stating that unless the
order is complied with at once the ranches
will be condemned as nuisances and
treated as such.
The removal of the ranches will be a
great boon to the residents of several sec
tions, as they live in almost constant iear
ot an epidemic of diseases from the tilth
that accumulates wherever the .swine are
kept.
FRACTURED HIS SKULL.
Result of. a Row on Board the British
Ship Was dale.
William McÃain, a sailor on the British
ship Wasdale, lying at Spear-street wharf,
was taken to the .Receiving Hospital last
evening suffering from a fractured skull.
Drs. Rinne and O'Brien performed the
operation of trephining the skull, but Mc-
Bnin is in a critical condition.
McÃain and a colored sailor named
John Fleming had a quarrel in the fore
castle, and McÃain, who is always ready
with bis fists, knocked Fleming down.
Fleming seized a capstan-bar and struck
McÃain on the forehead with it, fracturing
his skull. Fleming also struck another
sailor on the shoulder with the bar, but
only slightly injured him.
Fleming was arrested and charged at
the Harbor police station with assault to
murder.

Why She Broke the Glass.
Christina Harrington was arrested yesterday
afternoon and taken to the Southern station,
where she was charged with disturbing the
peace and malicious mischief. She went to
the office of Attorney Thomas C. Curran yester
day afternoon and charged him with neglect
insr her interests. Ho ordered her out of the
office, but she refused to go, and be sent for
Policeman Flynu. Miss Harrington raised a
disturbance and broke the glass In the office
door as the policeman was taking her away.
She said she had done nothing to be arrested
for, and broke t lie glass so that they would
have something to charge her with.

Thirty- First and Thirty-Ninth As
sembly Districts Nominate.
The delegates to the Twenty-third Sena
torial District met last evening and nomi
nated Michael J. Welch for Senator.

and that he would continue to be such,
and that he would work for the ticket.
At the close of the Senatorial conven
tion the two Assembly districts, which
make up the Senatorial District, the
Thirty-hrst and Thirty-ninth districts,

PANHANDLERS PLEASED.
The Street Committee Will Improve
Oik and Stanyan Streets.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors has agreed to recommend
that $30,000 be expended in improving Oak
and Stanyan streets.
Dr. Salfaeld, in a few pointed remarks,
convinced the committee of the immediate
necessity of the work and the request for
an appropriation was unanimously
granted. Secretary Russell was instructed
to communicate witn the Superintendent
of Streets and order the work done at once.
McENERNEY'S NEW POINT
Finds an Old Law Which May
Mean Much cr Mean
Nothing.
The County Government Act Says
Officials Must Pay All Ex
penses.
If Garret McEnerney is right then some
of the extra two-year office-holders will be
bankrupt long before the end of their term.
The able young attorney finds authority
for this opinion in section 163 of the coun
ty government act, which reads as follows:
In counties of the tirst class the officers snail
receive as compensation for the services re
quired of them by law, or by virtue of their
office, the salaries fixed by law.
becilon 210 of the saraeact (Statutes of 1893,
page 507} reads as follows:
"The salaries and ft.es provided in this act
shall be In full compensation for all services of
every kind and description rendered by the
officers therein named, either as officers or ex
offic'o officers, their deputies and assistants,
onlesaln ilns act otherwise provided; and all
deputies employed snail be paid by their prin
cipals out M the salaries hereinbefore pro
vided, unless lv this act otherwise provided."
The salaries fixed by law in case of the
offices affected by the recent decision of
the Supreme Court are: Coroner $4000,
County Clerk fiOOO, District Attorney
IoOUO, Public Adraini.-trator fees. Recorder
$4000, Sheriff $3000. Unless the Supreme
Court reverses its own decision these offi
cials will be in somewhat of a fix, because
the law says all deputies "shall be paid by
their principals out of the salaries herein
before provided." The reference ''herein
before" is presumed to mean "salaries
fixed by law."
As the decision of the Supreme Court
puts the act in operation immediately, it
is not clear at present how some of the
officials will get around paying this
mouth's salary to their deputies.
The point in regard to salaries is to be
used in the Supreme Court by Mr. Mc-
Enerney and those attackiug the four-year
term. By the disclosure of the point it
seems to compel the men who have been
congratulating themselves on getting a
four-year term, to aid the two-year men in
having the decision set aside.
THE CHARTER DISCUSSED.
Teacher* Hear Addresses on It at the
Girls' High School.
A circular was issued Wednesday and
Thursday by a committee of teachers in
this City's schools, characterizing the new
charter as a vicious attempt to do away
with the tenure of office of teachers, and
virtually establishing a board of inspec
tion over them. This legislation, the cir
cular states, was conceived by an ex-
School Director, who during his term of
office was notorious for his efforts to
hamper teachers, and subject them to the
arbitrary control of the board.
The Merchants' Association, in order to
explain away what they considered mis
conceptions, called a meeting of the
teachers for 4 p. M. yesterday at the Girls'
HiKh School. James D. Phelan, Attorney
Edward R. Taylor, F. W. Donrmann and
Henry L. Clement made lengthy addresses,
which were responded to by Principal
O'Connor of the Horace Mann Grammar
School, Albert Lyser of the John Swett
Grammar School and Cecil Mark cf the
Everett Grammar. The latter two teacheis
favored the new charter. O'Connor pro
fessed himself satisfied with the explan
ation of several doubtful points, but raised
others.
All who spoke for the charter believed
that the general laws held within bounds
the cause for which teachers could be dis
missed and promised amendments to the
most objectionable features. The meeting
was made very lively by the pointed ques
tions of several teachers and the frequent
slings they took at the present Board of
Supervisors.
Attorney Taylor pleaded with the teach
ers not to permit some small, insignificant
clause to cause them to work against a
much needed charter. Dohrmann closed
the meeting with a rather lengthy but
cogent speech, frequently eliciting ap
plause. He said politicians could be over
come, and so conld all puerile objections
but if the mass of intelligent schoolteach
ers fought the charter it would be
doomed.

BRAY'S HEAD IN DANGER
Sold a Transportation Order on
the Southern Pacific
Company.
Aa Innocent M;n Arrested on a
Charge of Forgery, and a Pen
sicner Implicated.
C. E. Bray, the local general agÂ«snt of
the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad,
is speeding to Chicago in an endeavor to
save his official head from decapitation.
The offense charged against him is the
unpardonable sin among railroad passen
ger and ticket agents. He is said to have
sold transportation to a scalper with a
full knowledge that the rules and regula
tions governing passenger and ticket
agents was being violated thereby.
The scurrying of Bray to Chicago, the
headquarters cf the road he represents in
this City, is the sensational sequel to the
story of the arrest, trial and acquittal of
G. H. Lawrence on a charge of having
forged a transportation order on the
Southern Pacific.
About two weeks ago or more Parker
Bray, a pensioner of the United States
and the father of C. E. Bray, started for
Washington, V. C, and white there wrote
to Colonel Lee, quartermaster of this de
partment, with headquarters in this City,
for transportation to Chicago and return,
stating that the trip was for the purpose
of procuring a wooden leg. The applica
tion was made through his son, C. E.
Bray, who eventually secured from Colonel
Lee an order on the Southern Pacific
Company for the transportation desired.
It is this order which Bray is now ac
cused of having sold to Conklin & Co., a
firm of ticket-scalpers, and he is said to
have pocketed the proceeds, to be kept in
trust for his father.
When Lawrence was on trial charged
with having forged the name of Parker
BrayÂ«to the order which procured him
transportation to Chicago C. E. Bray was
put on the stand, and when asked if he
had not disposed of the order to Conklin
& Co. he declined to answer on the ground
that it would tend to criminate him.
This led to an investigation of the mat
ter by the Southern Pacific Company with
the object of securing the punishment of
the offender against the rules and regula
tions of the Passenger Association and
they claim to have traced the offense to
tue door of Bray tils.
Anticipating the future, C. E. Bray toot
the 6 o'clock train on Wednesday evening
for Chicago, with the intention of trying
to "square" himself with his superiors.
The matter is one in which every rail
road is deeply interested, as by the alleged
action of Bray the railroads are deprived
of the revenue that would have been
created by Lawrence s purchase of a ticket
had he not been able to buy the Bray
transportation order, and Bray's action is
also viewed as a gross violation of the
rules of the Oakland and San Francisco
Passenger Association. If Bray is notdis
charged by his employers he will be tried
by his local colleagues and the severest
possible penalty imposed if he is convicted.
it is not unlikely that Parker Bray will
also become involved in trouble with the
War Department for his part in the affair.
The horse chestnut indicates luxury.
This is thought to be on account of the
size of its burrs.

NEW YORK, N. V., Sept 24.â Stocks were
less active to-day, the sales footing up 190,064
shares, against 221,000 yesterday, but the tone of
the market was firm throughout. The strength of
prices was a surprise to the average operator, in
view of the advance of the rate of discount by the
Bank of England to 3 per cent and the poor show
ing of the St. Paul road for the third week of Sep
tember. Certain traders sold on the idea .that the
developments referred to would lead toliqu.da
tlons. but, instead of selling, commission-houses
were buyers of the standard issues. Money on
time also worked easier, transactions being re
ported a: 6 per cent for three to four months.
Additional purchases of cold in London for ship
ment to the United States had a strengthening In
jjuence on the share market. On the other hand
sterling exchange was a shade firmer owing to
in â â¢ raise in money rates abroad, and In some
quarters it was thought that this would check the
flow of cold this way. The notably strong stocks
were Chicago Gas, the grangers, Manhattan,
Louisville and Nasnville, Tobacco and Western
Union. Manhattan was benefited by reports of
better earnings, and Chicago Gas by purchases
said to be for inside account, sugar was feverish
throughout and ranged between 110%<3>112y 8 ,
closing 8t 1111/2. The reports that the Mollen
hauer Refining Company had Increased its capital
stock coi not b<s confirmed.
This rumor bad a good deal to do with the break

CHICAGO MARKKTS.
CHICAGO, lit, Sept. 24.â Wheat started in to
day's session about a cent to the better of yester
day's close wltn traders nervous and anxious.
Buying orders were in the majority and a heavy
business was transacted, the tone being firmly
strong and prices during the first hour advancing
%c further. A great many traders were working
fora reaction on the assumption that much of the
wheat accumulated on the bulge would soon be
offered for sale. This inclination 011 the part of
some was a meek on the- advance and held prices
from jumping too rapidly. Liverpool and Conti
nental cables fully reflected our ..ain of yesttrday,
that fact being the leading factor at the start.
North western receipts were moderate at 806 |
cars, against 832 last Thursday and 1022 a year |
ago Chicaco receipts were 186 cars and inspected
out 69,000 bushels. The Cincinnati PrlceCurient
summary gave no important information to-day.
The market showed evidence of being strained
about noon, and from that time on recessions were
general. Export clearances were 573,611 bushels.
Closing Continental cables were higher, but wore
quotably barely steady. December wheat opened
fr.m(sS%c to 65% c, sold between 665, 8 c and
6i%c, ci-.sing at-65%c bid, %@y 8 higher than
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 285
cars.
CORNâ A few additional fractions werÂ» ad !ea
to the prices of corn simply through the influence
exerted on the general speculative mind by the
room in wheat. Very few entertain the idea that
corn has the ability of Itself to advance materi
ally, but the stress of bull sentiment in the neigh
boring market did not encourage shorts selling.
Liverpool cables were firm. Receipts were 603
cars, and 104,632 bushels were taken from store.
The Clnciniiiiti Price Current reported no itsju y to
corn by the recent frost. Export clearances were
heavy at 775:87 bushels. Prices eased off with
wheat later. May corn opened from 2514 c to
I 2fÂ»y c. sold between 25Â»4c and 2514 c. closing at
! 25% c bid, a shade higher than yesterday. Esti- I
mated receipts for to-morrow, 90'J cars.
OATSâ Were slow of action, but derived
strength sufficient from wheat to Imnrove a little j
in price. Nothing approaching importance trans- â¢
plred duri g the session. Receipts were *295 cars
and i>7,315 bushels were taken from store. Ex
ports amounted to 30,821 bushels. May oats 1
cosed y B c under yester. ay. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 300 cars.
FLAXâ Was linn. Cash, 70i4@71c; Septem- I
her, 70c bid; December, 71^@72^c. Receipts i
44 cars.
PROVISIONSâ Were fairly active and firmer; !
the bull sentiment which prevailed in wheat i
seemi-d to have extended to product and prices i
advanced moderately. The tiog market was j
stronger, which was necessarily a strengthening 1
argument in provisions. January pork closed 15c |
higher. January lard 12Vfe@15c higher, and Janu
ary ribs 7y a @loc hUlier.

Oakland Office Saw Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Sept. 24. J
When Past Master N. W. Spaulding de
livered the eulogy this afternoon at the
head of the bier on which lay the remains
of Dr. E. H. Pardee, there was gathered
around the most truly representative body
of people, both men and women, that the
Masonic Hall ever accommodated.
The ceremony was carried out with all
the mystic and suggestively beautiful
rites of the Masonic order. Alameda
Chapter, R. A. M., and Oakland Com
mandery, K. T., were present^ but large
as was the number it constituted but a
small portion of the va-t crowd that as
sembled to take the iast look at the man
v\no has figured so prominently in this
community for forty years.
In the dimly lighted rhamber the Sir
Knights stood around the casket w..ile
\Vor>hipful Master Gilbert Daniels nave
the word to the quartet and "Our Days
Are as a Shadow" was expressively sung.
Rev. Dr. McLean spoke of his personal
knowledge of the value of the deceased in
t is city. "He has beer, a shaker an I de
veloper oi the city of Oakland for more
than a quarter of a century. In the early
part of his life he aided materially to build
the city. There can be no more attractive
life than to have a share in the buildinz of
a city. While a Coanci.m. n his integrity,
honesty and fearlessness asserted them
selves, and during his terms of office as
Mayor bis influence was all directed
toward improvement. He was literally
an opener oi Dlinu eyes, the bring* r bat k
of sight :o many who ban ios-t :his price
less boon of sight to the afflicted."
N. W. Spaulding, past master of the or
der, then delivered a tribute to t e worth
of the late Mason.
The pallbearers were N. W. Spaulding
â¢nd C. B. Rutherford from Oakland Lodge,'
George Patterson and Solomon Lathrop
from Oakland Commandery, J. F. T .wle
and C. K. Marshall from tne City Council,
H. B. Rand and Albert Shorey from the
Police Department. The casKet was placed
in the Tubbs vault in Mountain View
Cemetery.
COWS WON'T BE KILLED
The Tuberculin Test Ordinance
Vetoed by the Mayor
of Oakland.
Davie Speaks From Eiperi a nce Re
garding Wild Oats and Foxtails
in Cows' Throats.
OAKLAND. Cal., Sept. 24.â The or
dinance providing for a tuberculin test of
all dairy cattle was vetoed by Mayor Davie
to-day, vtbo said in bis message to the
Council:
"I did not fully believe in the test and
was not convinced by any means by the
post-mortem held on Dr. Wheeler's cow.
Foxtails and wild oaÂ» heads will cause
the same throat trouble which was found
in the victim lor autopsy. I know this
Irom practical experience.
"If this te-t law is necessary it should
be enacted by the State Legislature, and
to post one it until next winter will
cause but little if any harm.
"By having the State act the City would
probably avoid all expense fqr a commis
sion should it be appointed to make the
lest. The dairymen will surely complain
if the law is enacted, and suits lor
damages will be the result. It is just as
well to have them brought against the
State as to have Oakland the party de
fendant."

Expense.
OAKLAND, Cal., Bept. 24.â The an
nual meeting of the Good Roads Asso
ciation of Alameda County was held at

the Supervisorial candidates who will an

lings a month are as good as daily
sprinklings with ordinary water.

Result of a Mother's Appeal to the
Courts to Secure Her Young
Daughter.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Sept. 24.â Little, co
quettish, black-eyed Anna Julia Furtado,
the 14-year-old child whose mother ob
jects to her marrying a man three times
her age, w;ll not do so until the matter of
her guardianship is settled, October 15, or
at least that was the pledge of her attor
ney to-day when the return was made
upon the writ of habeas corpus sued out
by Maria J. Furta \o against Manuel
Azeredo and wife requiring them to pro
duce the child in court.
The attorney for Azeredo claimed the
child was not restrained, but remained
with the iamily out ot choice. The court
refused to act on this showing. The
Society fcr Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren, however, held thut there was an
effort being made to get the child out of
the jurisdiction of the court and marry her
to this man', who was paying the family to
get her for him. On this they held it was
a case in which the court should interfere.
The matter went over until October 5.

The strucgle for the control of the

One of These Men "Will Be the Next Chairman of the Alameda County Central Republican
Committee.
interest at this time among Republican
politicians. The stand taken at the con
vention by Senator Earl in the interest of
Charles Mautalen of the Sixth Ward has
complicated matters, as Earl was most
decidedly an anti-Mautalen man ail
through the past two years, during which
time Mautalen has been chairman of the
County Committee.
It was made known to-day that whole
sale changes in the County Committee
were contemplated, but they w^re blocked
by J. W. Evans of the Seventh Ward. It
was proposed to put in the committee
William G. Henshaw of the Seventh, Vic
tor H. Metcalf of the Fifth and W. H.
Cnickering of the Third. Tdese men
would have been a toÂ»er of strength to
tiie committee, as all are influential suc
cessful business men of suci financial
standing that under no circumstances
would politics be anything but a second
ary consideration to them, not one of
them â¢ ever having shown a desire for
office. This plan, however, was prevented
by Mr. Evans, who said: "I am anxious
to succeed myself on the committee. I
have taken a definite stand during the
past two years, and I want to have an
otner term as an indorsement, if nothing
else, of my past record." Evans was
elected from the Seventh and the changes
were not made.
When the convention by a narrow
majority refused to indorse Chairman
Mautalen there was every npperrance of a
deadlock, and Senator Earl came to the
rescue.
"Something had to be done," said the
Senator, to-day, "and I feared that if .the
Sixth Ward's choice was not indorsed they
would bolt the convention. That would
have complicated matters very seriously,
and would have resulted in two years
more of quarreling, such as we have had
in the past. At this time there is more
harmony in the Republican party in this
county than we have had for a long time,
and I did not want to see anybody walk
oat of the convention. Concessions had
been made from all parties, and it would
nave been very foolish to have ended in an
uproar. I have been roundly abused for
my speech which harmonized the conven
tion, but that is the fate of a man who
goes to a convention.
F. J. Fletta, Town Trustee of Alameda,
and J. W. Evans are the candidates of the
new County Committee, which meets on
Saturday. The members ot the old com
mittee are in favor of Fletta, while the
new members want Evans, and the fate of
each is in doubt.
The disagreement among the fusion
people in the Forty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict has made it practically certain that
F. W. Leavitt, the Republican nominee,
will have a walk-over. The Democrats,
who were given that district by the Popu
lists, put up Hiram Luttrell and W. A.
Ralston. As neither could get the nomi
nation M. J. O'Gara was substituted, and
now there is confusion all around and
knives are being sharpened on all sides.
Tnomas Pearson, an independent colored
candidate, is the only other man in the
fight. >

PLEASANTON, Cal., Sept. 24.â The in
quest in the case of Antonio Garcia, the
Indian found dead on the steps of Jacob
Schwartz's house, broug it out the fact
that he had been on a protracted spree,

of the lungs caused by exposure. When

face he refused to answer. The Coroner
committed him to a constable for con

A Merciful Judge
Albert Sweet Is a lucky b or. A week ago he
stabbed Joe Rowan, a schoolboy, In the back
with a pocket-knife, and on Wednesday Judge
Cfimpbell dismissed the case, as it was shown
that Rowan first slapped Sweet in the face.
Yesterday Albert again appeared before the
Judge on a charge of stealing a pair of shoes
from a store on Kearny street. The Judge was
aÃain merciful, and sentenced him to stay a
week in the City Prison.

F rmers Who Work Hard Think of

There were long faces yesterday in the
headquarters of the Democrats and the
People's party when it â¢was learned that
George W. Monteith had filed his certifi-
cate of nomination as the People's party
candidate from the First Congressional
District with the Secretary of State.
The placing of Mr. Monteith's name on
the ticket as the candidate of the People's
party, speaking through the Congressional
District Convention, will oblige the Secre
tary of State to place Mr. Cutler's name
on the ticket as a Democrat only, instead
of as a Democrat and Populist, as the
managers of the fusion job intended, be
cause the election law provides that two
candidates cannot be nominated by the
same political party for the same office.
Mr. Monteith did not secure his certifi
cate without considerable trouble, the
Democratic and Populist iobbers having
resorted to almost every expedient to keep
it from him.
Wednesday was the last day allowed by
law for the filing of certificates of candi
dates whose nominations by party con
ventions have to be certified to the Secre
tary of State.
Chairman Alford of the Democratic
State Central Committee personally at
tended to the filing of the certifi
cates of his party. He a!so filed the
resignation of Candidate Maddux, the
nominee of the Democracy for Congress
from the Seventh District. Mr. Maddux
had been very determined not to be re
moved by the fusion managers and posed
for a time as a man standing on principle,
but he was evidently cajoled or whipped
into line, for he came off his tall horst and
obediently swallowed the party pro
gramme.
This leaves Messrs. Monteith, Mc-
Ghishan and Kelly alone standing out,
Mr. Kelly had his certificate on file some
time ago and McGlashan's came in late
last week, but Monteitb's had not ap
peared and Chairman Alford smiled a
knowing smile as his attention was called
to the absence of Monteith's document,
Monteith had been apprised of the at
tempt to keep his name off the ticket, and
he quietly slipped away from town last
Monday night and dropped in on the
enemy at Redding early on Tuesday
morning. It was necessary that his cer
tificate ot nomination should be signed by
Joseph Bell, chairman, and John C. Mur
phy, secretary, of the First Congressional
District Convention, and both those gen
tlemen reside in Shasta County.
When Monteith boarded tun train last
Monday night he found Chairman Alford
among his fellow-passengers. Alford was
easily thrown off the track and Monteith
was enabled to reach Redding without
attracting the attention of the enemy.
He found Mr. Bell home sick in bed
and Mr. Bell executed the instrument
There was no Notary Public in the neigh
borhood and . the nearest Justice of the
Peace was c. opping wood seven or eight
miles away in the direction of Mount
Shasta. Monteith tramped through the
chaparral and manzanita brush, stepped
accidentally upon a rattlesnake and
crushed the life out of it, relieved the per
spiring Judge of bis ax and brought him
to Judize Bell's house, where the certifi
cate was duly acknowledged. Murphy
was found in Redding, and he could find
no way out of it except to sign the docu
ment, which he did.
In speaking of his candidacy Mr. Mon
teith said:
My position is not one of obstinacy, self-will,
nor "personal ambition, bat is simply because
I believe ttiat it is a duty to the Populist party,
under the peculiar circumstances existing iv
this case, to remain. A union of forces fairly
entered into would have met with my appro
bation, even though I had been obliged to sac
rifice my own candidacy, but the present .u
-slon scheme is not only unfair and unjust, but
it is simply a partol a prearranged programme
engineered by the railroad company in combi
nation with an arrangement made between
Thomas V. Cator and Stephen M. White to
sacrifice every material interest of the rank
and tile of the two parties for the selfish par

poses of these two schemers. Mr. Cator and
those whom he controls in the State Commit
tee huve golie into a plan by which the Popu
lists gave up every Senatorial district in the
State at this election, when they could have
carried six or seven, and this makes it impos
sible to have a Populist Legislature for at least
lour years.
In addition to this the principles of Popu
lism ure naturally opposed to permitting com
iniuÂ«es to override or usurp functions of rep
resentative conventions of the people; and
while It is the privilege of a candidate to vol
untarily withdriw any attempt to force him
to do so in the absence of specific charges is
not only outrageous and indecent but is op
posed to every principle for which the Populibt
party exists.
Tlit-re is not the slightest quostion as to the
trade between White and Caior. I have it on
the hest of authorityâ from the lips of Thomas
V. Cator himself. "Populists are very much
opposed to the idea of giving ud the entire
State Senate. We could nave elected a Sena
tor in a number oi diNtrics, aud then in two
years we would stand in a good position to
elect a Peonle'- party Legislature. While we
are auxlous to elect a Populist United States
Senator there is a great deai of important leg
istfuion that the Populists hope to aeco'mplisn
for them toelec-. tin.- State Government two
years from now. But by lessening the oimnees
of electing a (ew members vow it will be four
years b' fore :hcy can hope to control tne Sen
ate. Thus, by reason ot Cutor's selfish ambi
tion a great veal of injury cau be done to the
iateiesis of the party. â 
Considerable indignation exists among
Populists in the First District regarding
the conduct cf Chairman Warii.il and
Stir-tary Bush. They say that Wardall
draws a salary of $100 per month, when
is a big salary for him, for supper. in^z
Populist candidates, and that he is spend
ing the income oi the First Congressional
District in supporting Cutler, the Demo
cratic candidate.
Moiieith's friends say that Bush draws
down $75 per month in gold at 32 to 1, the
same kind oi coin In wtiich Mr. Wardall
is paid, and thai one of Mr. Bus 's multi
farious duties is to net the County Cora
nritee to pay for Cutler's hall rent. This
leaves nothing to pay for Monteith's hall
rent.
The Populists of the district are assessed
20 cents apiece fur the purpose of furnish
ing the State committee with funds to
support the candidates of the party, yet
the money is used for Democrats. One or
two counties in the district have declared
that they will not send any more money
to the Slate committee to be spent on
Democratic candidates. The only thing
the Populists of that district have to fight
for now js the Congressman, and they
don't propose to have their bard-earned
silver and gold dollars used in assisting
the enemy under the cloak of fusion.
One hundred nonest dollars per month
se^ru to most Populists to be a princely
salary, much more than the average farm
earns, and they do not sep wl>y this money
should be expended on Democrats whiie
the Democrats have a State Central Com
mittee and a fund of their own.

Supervisors and School Directors
Will Be Selected at Tc-Night's
Sassion.
The Citizens' Independent Convention
held a long session last night.
Chairman Fitch was kept busy in hold
ing down the enthusiastic delegates who
were eager to have their favorite nominees
placed on the ticket, while the secretary,
W. D. Kingsbury, was also kept busy tak
ing notes of the numerons motions and
counter-motions made by t,be delegates.
The question of selecting Supervisors
from the numerous names suggested has
kept the convention somewhat back in the
other work before it.
After an hour's debate as to the proper
course to pursue in selecting twelve men
out of the thirty-six submitted, it was
finally agreed that the committee take to
day in pruning the list and presenting to
the convention to-night a sufficient num
ber of the best for final ratification. The
same course will be pursued with regard
to the School Directors.
In addition to the names already pub
lished in The Call, the following Assem
blymen were nominated last night:
Twenty-ninth Districtâ E. J. Thomas, 183

Mines and
Mining
At no time In the history of the State has
the mineral development of Oregon attracted
such general attention as at the present time.
Wfcile this is true, it is also a substantial fact
that mining properties in Oregon, were they
located in such districts as Trail Creek or
Cripple Creek, would bring to the owners a
price fabulous in comparison to the meager
figures that are offered for Oregon properties.
It is this uniortunate condition that the
miners of Oregon have to contend with, and
yet in a great decree the owners of mining
properties within the boundaries of the State
are in no small measure responsible. The
trouble is that owners of a prospect insist that
their prospect holes are developed mines, and
put a figure on their claims accordingly.âOre
gonian.
There is a great deal of truth in the
charge that owners of undeveloped claims
put such prices on them as to drive capital
away. The peneral improvement in the
demand for mines inaugurated a short
lived boom that caused some owners of
claims to lose their heads. Every hole in
the ground became a mine. There were
sales at prices much above the value of the
properties, which had the effect of making
every owner of a claim bvlieve he bad a
fortune, and there has been so much talk
about mysterious syndicates and their ex
perts traveling around the country that
strangers are often accounted secret agents
of the Rothschilds, after "good things."
The boom is tapering down somewhat,
and we are glad to >cc tbat claim-owners
are getting more s-ensible and moderate in
their views. This will result in a larger
investment of capital, for it is positively
the fact that experts sent to look up prop
erties have been driven elsewhere, conse
quent upon the far-above-value prices
asked for mines in the State. The moral
of it ail is do not drive capital away by
asking fabulous prices for undeveloped
claims, tbat for want of it may continue
to be conundrums.
The Oasas says that Colonel Lioyrl D.
Waddell of New York City, representing
a syndicate of heavy capitalists headed by
Frederick J. Lancaster of 2 Wall street,
Las just closed a deal by which there
passes into their hands the absolute titles
to the justly noted gold properties, the E^
peranza and Francisco mines, which are
located in the Maedalena district of So
nora, about twenty-live miles southwest
of the town of Imuris, and are said to be
two of the most promising gold mining
propositions in all Sonora. Reports made
after careful and thorough investigation
show tbat the veins are true rissures and
tbat the properties are cf great value. The
properties are well developed, having over
2000 feet of shalts, tunnels, drifts and
winzes, exposing to sight over 200,000 tons
of high-grade ore.
It is claimed that the Rescue mine at
Warren, Idaho, is producing some ore
worth $2 per pound.
People continue to go from the valley
towns to the new mining regions around
Randsburj:, Kern County.
On the Rand, South Africa, for the first
half of this year the dividends paid by
mining companies â iwenty-one in alt â
amounted to Â£854,851, as aicainst Â£1,360,
-255 paid by thirty-two companies in the
first half of 1895. The total production was
1,052,000 ounces, valued at about Â£3,500,
-000. The dividend?, therefore, amounted
to nearly 25 per cent ot the output.
The Cceur d'Alenes will add between
$7,000,000 and $8,000,000 to the wealth of
the world this year, according to Mining
Industry. The Standard mine is perhaps
the most remarkable in ail of the pro
ducers of that section. When the present
owners gained control of the property it
was an old location, and had iain idle for
a long time. An immense amount of
money was expended, and 3000 feet of tun
nel, shafts and levels were run beiore
striking ore, and for three years the share
holders were regularly assessed. Wiien
the Dody of ore was encountered it com
menced to pay, and pay big. Within
eighteen months $800,000 has been paid in
dividends. This amount has been paid in
monthly dividends of $50,000 earch, with
one or two exceptions. Tne company i 3
capitalized for $500,000. The ore concen
trates rive into one, and the value of the
concentrates is ninety ounces oi silver and
70 per cent lead. The ot her mines which
have paid dividends are the Cceur d 1 Alene
company, better known as the Poorman,
which has paid $340,000; the Helena and
Frisco, $425,000; ihe Granite, $63,400; the
Tiger, aoout $180,000, and the Bunker H:ll
and Suliivau, $150,000.
The Alaska Treadwell mine report end
ing May 31 shows a very low rate of ex
penses. During the year 263,670 tons ot
ore was mined and milled ; ail expenses of
construction, as well as freights on
bullion, mint charges and all expenses of
management, were charged to operating
account, and the net cost works out at
only $1 08 per ton. The total yield per ton
was $2 97, or a little more than three
penny-height, and the net profit for the
yeai available for dividend was $497,342.
Th â¢ Horse Creek Alining Company,
Calaveras County, has just made a ciean
up, with very satisfactory returns to the
owners. The gold is coarse, one piece
weighing $61.
A" discovery has been made near Hog
Creefc, Granite Pass, Or., of an immense
bed of red porphyry, which, although
showing no vein matter, gives $22 per ton
in gold.
There is likely to be much suffering
among miners at Cooks Inlet, Alaska.
There are said to be over 1000 destitute
miners now at that point with winter be
fore them, and without means to get
away. Something should be done for
them at once. It would be a most praise
worthy act for some charitable person to
solicit subscriptions to a fund to bring
them home again. The transportation
companies that took them to Alaska
should in all decency give them passage
at nominal rates. There are* women and
children among the sufferers.
T. A. McLaughlin returned the fore part
of the wsex from the desert mines near
Aloiave, saystiie Arroyo Grande Herald,
and he brought some fine specimens of
gold ore, showing t; c yellow metal stick
ing out all over the rock like pin beads,
also gray carbonate and peacock carbon
ale, from six ounces of which were smelted
out three ounces oi gold, silver and lead
combined. He represents the mines as
wonderfully rich, and expects to see 15,000
people in there ihis winter. Mr. Mc-
LauKhlin has spent nearly four months at
the mines, and i.as made many valuable
locations, and lias returned to have asays
made and arrange for the working of some
of bis mines.
Donohue & Co. have struck it rich in the
Jim Kelly mine on Donelly Gnlch in Dead
wood mining district. The ledge at the
top of tne drift is two feet wide and three
feet wide at the bottom. The ore is good
and will go $60 a too. They are now down
seventy feet, and the formation insures
the permauency of the ledge. This tun
nel will tap the mine at a depth of 200
feet. The company has been prospecting
the property and drifting for about a year.
Old Mines Reopened.
Within the last eighteen months five
extensive gold mines have been opened in
the Grnis Valley district, according to the
Grass Valley Tidings. Each has a good
reoord in the past as a gold producer, and
each was originally closed down on ac
count of immaterial complications which
were not a result of failure in the respect
ive properties. The Rocky Bar and Mas
sachusetts Hill, one of the reopened mines,
has an air-compressor plant that is cele
brated the world over, and also has mag
nificent hoisting and pumping work".
The shaft is down something over 250 feet.
Tne original gold shoot in this ground
has yielded over $5,000, 000. .
The Allison Ranch mine, which is now
putting in an expensive plant upon the
most modvrn ideas of construction, was
formerly one oi the best producers in the
State. It had yielded $4,120,338 before be
ins closed down. Its shaft was sunk to a
depth of only 700 feet.
The Gold Hill mine, whose pnmps are
now in operation, and which lias a mag
nificent plant r tin by electric power, pro
duced between $3,oou,oooand $4,000,000 and
it has never been worked beyond 500 feet.
The Bullion Consolidated is now down
about 500 feet. It has in the past pro
ducea 1906,8% it i* unquestionably an
extensive and valuable, property.
The Crown Point has lain idle for years,
but has just been started by a French
company, who have already struck into
valuable ore deposits. Work is going on
between the 400 and 500 levels. The mine
has produced $134,000.
Add to the above the Brunswick, which
has been put under more active manage
ment than formerly, and which has
already met with the greatest encourage
ment by the opening of a good ore body.
Also the purchase of new ground by the
Omaha, which it is intended to develop
under the management of one of oitr most
competent superintendents â all these de
velopments and reopenings are matters of
great encouragement in Grass Valley and
betoken better times.
But with all these encouraging outlooks
this should not be considered a favorable
camp for outside miners to come
to. There is abundant labor at band
to do all the work needful and the
miners now here, who have been
filling in months on tribute, or who
have been out of employment much
of the time, will be given the preference
when more help is wanted. We need
more capital to opun up other good prop
erties or to develop flattering prospects
rather than miners or unskilled laborers.
The lecige recently encountered in the
1350 level of the Argonaut mine in Cala
veras County is from twelve to thirteen
feet wide and rated at from $6 to $10 per
ton.
The Potalazula Mining Company has
been organized at Slitter Creek by Senator
Voorheis, T. T. Lane, J. Nicholas, E. S.
Barney and Wil.'iam McGee. This com
pany will operate the Mechanic's mine in
a scientific manner.
The Lewis gravel mine at Vallecito has
been sold for the sura of $9000. This mine
bears an excellent reputation in mining
circles and will be operated as soon as the
season for hydraulic mining opens.
Captain Jack has taken a bond on a rich
quartz mine near the mouth of Van Duzen
Canyon, San Bernardino County. He has
ordered 100,000 feet of lumberand will at
once nroceed to erect a five-stamp mill and
a number of cottages for workingmen to
occupy. He expects to have all this work
finished before winter sets in.
The Garrett mine just below the mouth
of Scott River is getting along nicely,
although the}' have not got down to pay
gravel yet. The new pump which they
put in recently works very satisfactorily.
Tne owners of tue mine are confident that
it will be a paying proposition.
Most of the hydraulic mines along Klam
ath River have been closed down, as their
supply of water has given out.
The Distlehorst and Barton Dredging
Company is now working at Buckeye Bar,
Siskiyou County. They have not struck
pay gravel yet, but have great hopes of
doing so where they are now working.
The reports regarding their making so
much had no foundation. The machinery
all works splendidly, and if they can find
pay gravel they will handle it easily.
NEW CHARTER ADVOCATES
An Argument by A S. Hallidie
in Favor of Its
Adoption.
A Resolution Designed to Secure
the Support of School*
teachers.
A meetinc of the Citizens' Charter Asso
ciation was held in Academy of Science
Hall last evening. The main feature of
the occasion was an address on the subject
of the charter by A. S. Hallidie. The
speaker reminded his bearers that the con
solidation act under which the City was
once well governed had been divested of
its strength and potency by frequent
amendment. The " tendency of amend
ment was to deprive the people of the
right of iocal government and to place
power in the hands of spoilsmen. The
only way he oould see for the taxpayers to
recover the right to govern themselves and
prevent the reign of spoilsmen was to
adopt the charter.
James D. Phelan, who had been presid
ing, asked another to take the chair in
order to introduce the following resolu
tions:
Whereas, Our law committee has given its
opinion that that article ot the proposed char
ter is unconstitutional and ineffective because
the general laws govern the schools and the
charter has no power to change said laws;
therefore be it
Resolved, That we the Citizens' Cnarter Asso
ciation do hereby gladly Rccept the opinion of
our law committee as a true statement of law
and are convinced of its soundness; and be it
further
Jiexolved, That in case the courts do not up
hold these views of the law and declare the
article in question unconstitutional we pledge
ourselves to preserve our organization and to
iorthwith propose and work for an amend
ment to the charter which will remedy beyond
doubt the objections complained of.
The resolutions were adopted.
A committee report was received giving
the names of >eventy-two dele.-ates, rep
resenting thirty-six organizations who
had lined up to support the charter.
The committee on press and publications
reported the distribution of a vast Quan
tity of charter literature and the eager de
sire of the populace for more of the same
kind.
AMONG TRAP-SHOOTERS.
Great Interest Is Taken In the Live
Bird and Inanimate Target
Tournaments.
Sportsmen are now interested in the
big live-bird and inanimate - target
tournaments which will be held
in the near future. On Sun lay. the 27th
inst., the Empire Gun Club will meet at
Alameda Point, the Golden Gate Club at
Alameda Junction and the Olympic and
San Jose Gun clubs at San Jose.
On October 2 and 3 the State sportsmen
will hold their annual live-bird tourna
ment at San Bruno. On the first day there
will be one six-bird shoot, three twelve
bird shoots and one tif teen-bird shoot, and
on the following day the programme
reads: One six-bird race, two twelve-bird
races, one fifteen-bird race and a grand
twenty-bird race for the Fay diamond
medal, which is at present held by Otto
Feudner, the champion live-bird and in
animate-target shooter of the State.
October 4 ana 5 the Inanimate Target
Association of California will meet at San
Jose, where great preparations have been
made for its reception by the Garden City
Gun Club. This will wind up Â«he trap
shooting season, as sportsmen are now
getting reaay for the opening of the duck
and quail shooting season, October 15.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1896.
BICYCLE CLUBS
TO PARADE AGAIN
Preparations to Organize a
Magnificent Column on
Wheels.
MANY EARLY RESPONSES
Some Novel Features in Decora
tion and Illumination Al
ready Assured.
ROUTE OF TEE PROCESSION
Promise of the Police Department to
Hold Intrusive Spectators in
Check.
The bicycle clubs of San Francisco, re-en
forced by wheelmen from the surrounding
country, will have a great parade Monday
evening, October 5. Many organizations
are already making active preparations to
win honor and prizes in the procession.
The feelinc is almost universal among
wheelmen that something should be done
on an orderly, systematic and magnificent
scale to atone for the disappointments in
the management of the last parade.
Again, it is held to be desirable that the
bicycle people should make a demonstra
tion of tbeir strength in the form of a
street review as an object lesson to candi
dates for the Legislature and municipal
offices.
Last evening there was a meeting at the
Nucleus building of the parade committee,
consisting of P. J. Hyde (chairman), P.
Allen Joy and Soi Peiser. The grand
m arshal, Edwin Mohrig, was present to
confer with the committee of the Wheel
men's Municipal League.
After an exchange of views the following
line was designated for the parade:
Formation in the vicinity of Union
square, with bead of column at Post and
Mason streets. Column to Â«nove at 8:15
down Post street to Kearny, along Kearny
to Market, on Market to Golden Gate
avenue, on the avenue to Webster street,
on Webster to Fulton, on Fulton to Van
Ness avenue, and on Van Ness avenue to
Marke'. street, where the column may
break rants.
Every individual, team, croup or or
ganization competing for a prize must, as
a condition of success, maintain a place in
the column throughout the whole course
of the parade.
Prizes to tbe value of $1000 will be
awarded. Many brilliant effects in illu
mination and some superb features of
decoration are promised.
Chief Crowley regrets as much as any
one cisc tbat the decorative features of the
last parade were marred by the intrusion
of disorderly spectators, and he has cheer
fully promised to lend the strength and
skill of his department to preserve the
next parade from a repetition of this un
pleasant confusion. The force of patrol
men, mounted and on foot, will be sufficient
to hold the crowds in check and maintain
a clear right of way for the parading
wheeimen.
A committee of the League of American
Wheelmen, consisting of J. W. Maeuire,
S. G. Scovern and Sol Peiser, la&t Â«â  veiling
received the acceptance of James W. Con
well, president ot the San Francisco Cycle
Board ofTrade. to speak atthn Pavilion this
evening on the "Baggage Bill and the
Coming Parade." The occasion this even
ing is wheelmen's night at the fair and a
large throng will attend.
The Ladies' Cycle Club of the Missionâ
the Alphaâ will be largely represents in
tbe great parade on the evening of Octo
ber 5.
The parade committee will meet at room
12, Nucleus building, every evening this
week and next week.

FIVE CASES
OF STATUARY
Their Importation Will Be
Investigated by the
Government.
A TALE OF TWO LETTERS
They Accuse Waldteufei & Com
pany of Violating the
Revenue Laws.
CONSIGNMENTS FOR CHURCHES.
The Matter in the Hands of the
Federal Government
Officers.
What may prove food for thought and
action by tbe United States Grand Jury is
being caretully investigated by Collector
Wise under the guidance of District At
torney Foote.
Two hours after Achille Waldteufei was
found dead in his own parlor, a few days
ago, District Attorney Foote and Collector
Wise received two anonymous letters.
The letters were written by the same
person and called attention to tbe impor
tation August 29 of five cases of statuary
from Cologne. The unknown writer far
ther said that a fraud had been committed
by the importer swearing that the articles
contained in the five cases were for a
church in Southern California. As is well
known, the law provides that any mer
chandise or work of art imported for some
particular church is not subject to uuty.
None of the officers directly interested
were inclined to give credence to the
charges contained in tbe anonymous let
ter until ti.e records disclosed tbe fact that
five cases had actually arrived at this port
from Cologne on the date mentioned. It
was further learned that on September 1
Achille Waldtenfel appeared before the
Collector, and after prod racing an order
from the priest at Banning for certain
statuary was given permission to take the
goods away.
More as a matter of form than anything
else a letter was addressed to the priest at
Banning asking if certain statuary had
been ordered, and if so bow many cases.
The reply came back that only two cases
had been ordered from Waldtenfel <fe Co.,
and that the same had been received.
Further inquiry developed a very peculiar
state of affairs.
When, two days ago, a Government
officer called at " 732 Market street and
askod about the statuary he was told that
it had been shipped to the parties for
whom it was ordered. They were then
request d to produce the freight receipts,
but they were unable to do this except in
the two cases sent to Banning. In the
meantime the officer observed three
statues answering tne description of those
imported. He asked Assistant Appraiser
Doolan iihe identified the articles as those
examined August 29, and he replied that
be did.
These inve tigations were conducted in
dependent of Collector Wise, but when
the facts recorded above were ascertained
they wer turned over to him, with the
recommendation that he take immediate
action in th*i matter.
As yet he has done nothing, for the
reason, as Denuty Collector Jerome says,
the ninety days allowed by law for Wald
teufei & Co. to return the receipt of the
consignee for the statuary has not yet ex
pired. In the meantime, however, Dis
trict Attorney Foote is Catherine all the
evidence in sight. If a fraud has been
committed he proposes to see to it that the
guilty parlies are prosecuted.
The Government bas secured a sample
of Achille Waldteufel's handwriting and
compared it with thai of the anonymous
letters. To the non-expert they appear
identical, and there is little doubt among
those who have charge of the case that
Waldteufei wrote the warning letters to |
Collector Wise and District Attorney j
Foote. There are some who affect to be
lieve that bis own connection with the
affair preyed heavily on him and that the
verdict of the Coroner's jury of "acci
dental death" was hasty.
MANUFACTURERS PROTEST.
The Board of Education Asked Not to
Purchase Blackboards in the Eaat.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation has sent a communication to the
Board of Education protesting against the
purchasing in tne East of blackboards for
the new Bernal Heights school.
The communication is in part as follows:
If you buy the Eastern blackboards, the $600
which comes from the taxpayers of ihis cum
muuity will go out of the State to help enrich
some other community. It you purchase the
California-made article at the same price, $150
will go East for ma.erial that is not made here,
and $450 oi the sum will remain in this .-tate
to give employment to the people who con
tribute tie money to pay for them. We there
fore ask that you give the order for these black
boards to the California manufacturer.

CROWDS ATTEND
THE FANCY FAIR
Brilliant Opening of the
Youth's Directory Fes
tival.
GIVEN IN ARMORY HALL
Enthusiastic Words of Praise in
Father Prendergast's
Speech.
A RAINBOW OF FINE BOOTHS.
Many Costly Objects of Art Being
So d and Ra; fledâ To Last
Two Weeks.
The First Regiment Armory was dressed
up in such gay garb and peopled with
such an army of fair women last evening
that its somber uses were all forgotten.
It was devoted to lieht and gayety and
rang with music and laughter. The occa
sion was the opening of the festival in the
interest of the fund for tbe new Youth's
Directory.
The opening was made the occasion of
an eloquent address by the chairman of
the committee, J. R. Kelly, and by Rev.
Father Prendergast, vicar-eeneral, both of
which were calculated to quicken the im
pulse of charity in general, and especially
in behalf of the Youth's Directory.
In the course of his address Mr. Kelly
said: "As the present home is entirely
inadequate to accommodate the ever
increasing number of applicants, the di
rectors have determined to purchase a
larger lot and to erect thereon a suitable
building.
"All the work of the directory is per
formed without the aid of one dollar from
State or municipal government; all its
labor is accomplished by the zealous
priest who is devoting his life to the wel
fare of the children and who performs tbe
work without noise or the flourish of
trumpets."
Rev. Father Prendergast was introduced.
He paid a high tribute to those who have
so successfully directed the destinies of
the Youth's Directory. He said it filled a
place distinct from that of the orphans'
asylum, and, if possible, a more difficult
one.
For the child whose parents, while still
living, are as neglectful toward their
offspring as though they were dead,
still has no right to apply to these
havens. It is here, and to these forlorn
waifs that the Youth's Directory stretches
out its hand to rescue and comfort and
save.
Father Prendergast then went on to
describe the institution for the benefit of
which tbe fair was being given, and
showed how worthy a charity it was. He
told of its methods of work, of its struggle
for existence and of the ever-present need
of a helping hand, a cheering word, a
trusty friend.
The sneaker said there were theorist?
and workers. "Among the theories," he
said, "there is one that lam sure if re
alized would prove most destructive of
real progress. I refer to woman suffrage.
"The institution most necessary to the
continuance of our Government is the
home. Young men laboring for a pit
tance are most careful how they assume
the permanent responsibility of marriage.
What, thpn, is the effect of woman suf
frage? Already. too many young women
are employed. Their employment has the
tendency to deprive young men of work,
and this keeps wages down. Only in the
purlieus of society do we find women sup
portine men. It is unnatural.
"The man should support tbe weaker
sex. Therefore, with all due respect to
the talented and eloquent and evpn hu
manitarian advocates of woman suffrage,
I must say that it is my belief that the
terfdency is not for good."
A concert followed ti.e speech-making,
vocal solos being rendered by Miss Powell
Mr. Berger, Miss Black and G. V. Wand.
Miss Daly gave a readinr.

A FORTY-NINER GONE.
Death of George L. Faulkner, a Pioneer
Frinter of This ( ity, in the
Mexican Capital.
George L. Faulkner, who for many years
has been associated with the printing in
terest of this coast, died on September 13

KINGSLEY'S MISFORTUNE
Suit Brought to Foreclose a Mort
gage on His Beautilul
Home.
Bookmaking on a Racetrack Not as
Easy a Game as Seme People
Think.
"Prince Charlie" in practically broke.
Five years ago he was worth a round
hundred thousand. Yesterday suit was
brought to foreclose a mortgage on his
home. Charles H. Kingslev, the pool
room proprietor of Pauper alley, or
"Prince Charlie." as his friends were
pleased to call him during his halcyon
days, ha & at last met the gambler's fate.
Like many another of his ilk, he had a
pyrotechnic sort of career, to the falling
stick period of which he has now come.
Kingsley, who per-onally is a genial,
gentlemanly, cheerful fellow, arrived in
San Francisco about ten years ago. He is
f aid to have come direct from New York
City, where he held a minor position in a
poolroom. Soon after his arrival here,
however, he became interested in the
management of a similar place on Leides
dorff street, and was the pioneer in this
City of the reprehensible business which
flourished for so long and was stamped
out with so much difficulty.
Ensconced in his revolving chair, behind
the brass railing in his smoky room in
"Pauper Alley. Kingsley levied tribute
on tbe sportively inclined downtown
workers, ihe dollars of the clerks were
raked in as cheerful. y and with as much
regularity as were the twenties and
hundreds of their employers.
As times went on, "Prince Charlie" grew
rotuqd and prosperous of appearance, and
his bank account more than kept pace
with tbe increase of his avoirdupois.
When the poolrooms were forced to re
move to Oakland in 1890, Kingsley was
commonly reported to have laid aside
$100,000 for the prospective rainy day.
The people of the City of Churches, how
ever, refused to tolerate the presence of
the gambling establishment in their city,
and from the day of his removal there
from dates Kingsley's downfall. It is
said that all tbe stock in trade a pool
room proprietor needs is a slate and a
piece of chalk, and that having them he
will surely make money.
With a bookmaker on the raccetrack it
is different. Many a knight of the cbaik
and chamois has been forced to "turn his
slate."
Such was Kingsley's fate. When he
could no longer run his poolroom ho
sought the racetrack and t; ere hung out
his shingle. The luck that had been his
seemed to have de-erted him, or else the
percentage ob:ainable in tbe betting on
foreign events was missing in the new
field. At any rate, at the end of the first
winter's racing, the genial "Charlie" was
badly bent. A few months later he was
reported "broke."
Whether tbe report was true or false
KiiiErsley forsook the racetrack and em
barked in tbe mining business, in which
pursuit be was supposed to have made
quite a sum of money. If he did, he bas
since dropped it all, for l&st winter he was
quite a constant attendant at the Bay Dis
trict Track, and was occasionally seen at
lnrrleside.
Kjnc -iiey possessed a beautiful home at
1546 Page street, near the Golden Gate
Park, and it is on this that tbe mortgage
is to be foreclosed. The Golden West
Building and Loan Society holds the docu
ment. The mortgage was originally for
$6000, of wfeich 14950 is still unpaid.
DON'T WANT THEIR
WORK CRITICIZED
The Health Officers Dislike
the Report of the
Grand Jury.
THEIR CAUSTIC REPLY.
Many New Political Fositioas
Created at Yesterday's
Session.
DOCKERY'S NICE NEW JOB.
Dr. Lovelace's Long List of Buildings
That He Wants Condemned by
tbe Board.
The much advertised reply of the Board
of Health to tbe recent report of the
Grand Jury was read at the meeting of the
former body yesterday, Secretary God
chaux going through twenty-three type
written pages filled with personalities and
vituperation.
The board found fault with the manner
in which it bad been criticized by the
Grand Jury, and in answer descended to
personal abuse, even going so far as to
attack the characters and business pur
suits of some of tne members of the jury.
The board tirst gees into hysterics to the
extent of fourteen pages, in an effort to
prove that the criticism of the Grand
Jury that the Health Department has
shown a "tine scorn of economics," is
untrue, and then devotes seven nages to
an attactc on ex-Superintendent Weaver of
the Almshouse. in an effort to show that
the jury's finding of his official efficiency
was not borne out. by the facts.
The remainder of the report is devoted
by the committee that signed it â Drs.
Hart, Morse and Fitzgibbon â to throwing
bouquets at the board.
Having dispo-ed of the mangled remains
of the Grand Jury the board be^an the
work of creating positions to eat up the
additional $30,000 appropriation given by
the Board of Supervisors on Monday last.
The resignation oi at least one employe,
the stenographer, who consented to take
the position when the pay was not at all
certain, was "accepted" and a friend of
Dr. Morse was substituted.
Positions were created and filled as fol
lows: Chief food and vinegar inspector.
$200 per month, J. P. Dockery; chemist,
$150 per month, W. T. Wenzell; veteri
nary surueon, $150 per month, J.
O'Rourke; health inspector, $100 per
month, P. M^lard; stenographer ani
typewri'er. iftiO per month, Mrs. M.
Turner, vice Mrs. M. Sichel, resigned;
three assistant foot: inspectors, $75 per
month each, Messrs. Hanlon, Regan and
Hall.
Dr. Lovelace recommended that build
ings at the following number^ be inspected
with a view to condemnation: Nnp. 718,
720, 808, 1108, 1110, 1114, 1116 and 1120
Stock i on ; 823, 825, 807, 807^ and 847 Clay :
734, 705, 639 and 635 Pacific; 3, 6^, 7. 6.*8,
10, 13, 14. \%\i and 22 Fish alley ; 724, 726
Washington ; 809, 811 and 813 Sacramento;
534 Vallejo; northwest corner of Jackson
anil Battery ; 416 and 418 JacKson.
The board decided to see the structures
at an early date.
Drs. Williamson and Fitzgibbon were
appointed a committee to select uniforms
for the emnloves of tbe board.
COQUETTISH CORBETT.
The Aatnte Pugilist Seem* to Be PlÂ»y-
ing One Local Athletic Club
Against Another.
Prize-fighier Corbett seems to be playing
fast and loose with local Datrons of tbe
manly art. For more than a weak he has
been in almost daily telegraphic corre
spondence with the National Athletic
Club, which has been trying to get up a
match between himself and Sharkey.
The Nationals offered him $10,000 if he
would come. The champion saia he would
not accede to the proposition unless the
cash were put up. The club offered gilt
edKed security, but Corbett remained ob
durate. Then the club sent a telegram
promising to deposit the cash in case Cor
bett and Sharkey would each put up $5000
in coin to cover the wager.
Corbett's answer arrived by telegraph
last night. He declines the club's offer
on. the ground that he has been engaged
by the Eureka Club.
It is understood that the Eureka Club
offered Corbett $12,000 for a match of ten
rounds, which offer the champion had re
fused to consider. Local sportsmen are
entirely at sea as to what Corbett is
driving at.

NATURALIZED TO

ticians.
For City and County AttorneyâArchi
bald Barnard.
Record of Naturalization, District
Court of the United States, September
21, 1896â Archibald Barnard, a native
of Canada, admitted to citizenship.
The Mahoney-Kelly faction has been
driven to its wits' end to find an attorney
who would accept the nomination from its
convention for the office of City and
County Attorney. Try as It would not
one lawyer could be brought to the scratch.
So the next best thing was done- The one
wingers selected a man who never voted
in the United Statesâ an alien whose
name does not appear on the great register,
and who cunnot vote in the coming elec
tion.
Archibald Barnard was a favorite â a
lone, solitary stand-by of the sideshow
politiciansâ and it made little difference
what his privileges were, or what claim he
would have upon tbp people as a candi
date for the important offic â¢ of City and
County Attorney. They took him with
open arms and gave Mr. Barnard, late of
Canada, tbe "glad hand."
To be sure Attorney Barnard was not a
naturalized citizen of the United States,
but then a little thing like that could be
easily remedied. And as the District
Court was regarded as a olace sequestered
from the eyes of men interested in politics
tbe sideshow managers imagined that the
remedy could be applied in that tribunal
during a quiet moment and the world
would be nothing the wiser of a record in
the clerk's office. \
Barnard jumped at the proposition pre
sented to htm, even if it did no against the
train to foreswear her gracious Majesty,
Quoen Victoria. From a subject to a
citizen was a very dizzy tumble for a man
wno declared his intention to become a
citizen as far back as January, 1889. But
it hud to be taken.
"I'm not a citizen." he declared in
agonized tones when asked to accept the
nomination.
"That's all right. We'll fix it, but keep
mum," was the assuring reply.
This happened on September 21 and
forthwith Barnard was marched to the
District Court, where, with the assistance
of Attorney? Hoefler and Heenan as wit
nesses, he was naturalized. The follow
ing is a copy of the document which tells
the story that did not pass unnoticed:
[Page 5873.]
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
RECORD OF NATURALIZATION.
In the District Court of the United States for
the Northern district of California.
In the i
Matter of the Naturalization I
of f
Archibald Barnard. J
Bo it ren.embered, that on this 21st day of
September, A D., 1896, being a day in the July
term, A. D. 1896, oi said court, Archibald Bar
nard, a native ot CnDada, an alien, and late a
subject of the Queen of Great Britain and Ire
land, appeared in said court and applied to be
admitted a citizen of the United States of Amer
ica, pursuant to the acts of Congress in relation
thereto. And having then and there produced
and exhibited to the court a certified copy of
his declaration of intention to become a citi
zen oi thf United Stat s of America, made in
tne Sup- rio- Court of the State of California in
and lor i he City and County ot San Fran aisco
on the 3.i diy of January,' 1889, and proved
by ihe oaths of L. M. Hoffler and John Hee
nun, citizen* -ti the United States, bis residence
within tLe Uiited States for the last five
years and his residence w'thin the
State for the la.st year, and by said
witnesses and other satisfactory proofs
that he is entitled to be made a citizen of the
United States, and having on oath hen de
clared, before said court, that he will sup
port the constitution of the United States of
America, and tnat he doth absolutely and en
tirely renounce and abiure all allegiance and
fidelity to every forugn prince, potentate,
state or sovereignty whatever, and particu
larly to Victoria. Queen of Great Britain and
Ireland, of whom be has hitherto been a sub
ject. Whereupon It Is ordered by the court
tnat said Archibald Barnard be admitted, and
he' is hereby adjudged- and declared, to be a
citizen of the Uniteu States of America.
In open court. W. \V. Morrow,
United States District Judge, Northern Dis
trict of California.
Attest: Southard Hoffman, Clerk of said
District Court.
Now, indeed, was Barnard a fit man for
the Kelly-Mahopey faction to present as a
candidate for the office of City and County
Anornev of San Francisco. He was nomi
nated Wednesday nieht â two days after
having been naturalized.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE FLAG.
Within a Few Days ItÂ« Fold* Win
Wave Across Market Strent.
"Let's have 'Old Glory' with all the stars
in it. All the Stales will give the ballot
to women pretty soon, anyhow,"
Thus spoke Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-Blinn
at a conclave of Woman Suffragists yester
day, and thus the decision went.
For some time past friends of the woman
suffrage movement had been of the
opinion that a fine banner hung across
Market street should mark the where
abouis of the Suffrage Bureau. But weeks
passed, and there was nothing but talk,
until the Alameda County ladies got to
work and raised a subscription for ti.e
purchase of tne banner. The amount thus
realized, with a small additional sum
raised in this City, was forthwith devoted
to tbe object designated.
The rlaj; will be 24 feet long by 18 feet
wide, and attached to its lower end will be
the words, "Woman Suffrage Head
quarters" in large black letters on a white
ground.
The banner will be in place in a day or
two. It is to bÂ« hung across Market street,
from the Parrott building to the opposite
property, and will, it is hoped, prove effec
tive in attracting visitors to the bureau.
Mulcted the Railroad.
A jury in Judge Daingerneld's court yester
day awarded Rosi Jira $2500 damages for
personal injuries sustained by reason of being
knocked down by a McAlliÂ»ter-s;reet car on
November 27, 1895. A stay of execution for
thirty days was granted.
