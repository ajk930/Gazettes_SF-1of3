CHICAGO, 1m... July s.â Senator Hill
did nut po to church this morn
ing. He had too many worldly mat
ters on his mind to think about things
celestial, and he remained in his rooms for
the greater part of the day doing the very
hardest kind of work â talking and being
talked to. He had a conference this fore
noon with several California delegates,
and during the day there was a steady
stream of sound-money people and others
going to and comin_- from his rooms.
Hill is a persevering man. He will not
acknowledge defeat until he lies prone
and helpless on the field, so, with that
pertinacity and indomitable energy which
has ma-ie him a political power in his own
State and one of the foremost Democrats
in the Nation, he is fighting against the
adoption of a straight out silver 16 to 1
', lank. All his energies are bent toward
the accomplishment of this object. He
knows that the platform will be for free
c jinage. but be wants to have that plank
made as mild as possible, and if he can
make a sufficiently strong combination in
the convention he can come pretty near
defeating any one of the candidates now in
the field who may be displeasing to him.
Failing to get the sharp edge of the sil
ver plank tiled down, he will endeavor to
secure the nomination for the Presidency
of some candidate who. although willing
to stand upon a silver plank, will not De a
crank upon that subject. Hili hateg cranks
and 1 a* therefore no love for Altgeid and
his following.
Of all the candidates whose names have
thus far been mentioned, tnere is one who
would be acceptable to both factions of the
Senator Cockrell of Missouri.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
Democracy, and that one is Stephen M
White of California. Senator Hill re
marked last nieht to a friend (not for pub
lication, but. the story leaked out) that if
he had to follow the party upon a silver
platform he would rather have Senator
White carry the banner than anybo ly else
whom knew; not that he had any idea
that the Senator from California was not
perfectly sincere on the free-coinaee ques
tion, but that he knew White to be an
able and safe man. and one to whose hands
the welfare of ti.e Nation might be wisely
intrusted.
There is no boom yet for Senator White,
nor is there likely to be one. It is more
than probable that when the friends of
tbe many candidates eet tired of pulling
and hauling and of bickerings, the Senator
from California will be brought forward at
the opportune time as a dark horse on
which the convention may ride safely over
the rocks of factional discord.
But neither Senator Hill nor any other
prominent member of the gold wing has
yet announced that he would vote at the
polls for a silver nominee on a silver plat
form. On the contrary, men high in the
councils of the party have declared that
they will not vote for the nominee of this
convention if the programme of the West
ern men should be carried out. They will
stay in the battle until the last shot has
been fired, and then, if their colors sink
down into the dust of defeat and humilia
tion, they will accept their fate like brave
soldiers of the old guard, and will die
with the words "No surrender!" on their
lips.
The financial question is to them more
than party. They declare that a free-coin
age platform would be a violation of tbe
tenets of Democracy â such a gross violation
that no Democrat would be bound to fol
low its banner in the coming campaign.
The signs of the times are propitious for
a Democratic Donnybrook, no matter how
affairs may turn out. This much is cer
tain: The sound-nioney Democrats, not
only in the convention but those in the
country at large, will refuse to vote for the
candidate and will cast their votes for
William McKinley rather than see the
business of the country ruined, as they
say it would be under a silver administra
tion.
The California delegation arrived this
morning, travel-stained and tired after its
tedious journey of four days and four
nights in the cars. All of its members are
in good health and spirits, and they
brought good spirits with them in the
shape of 130 cases of California wines of
! the finest brands and vintages that ever
perfumed the lip of an epicure. They
have established their headquarters in
parlor 38 in the Great Northern Hotel, and
to-morrow morning, after having recov
erei from the fatigue of their trip, they
will be prepared to dispense hospitality
rrith that generous hand which every true
Califorman carries with him.
Colonel John P. Irish stopped over in
Nebraska to repair some political fences,
and will be on deck in the morning to do
battle for the cause of sound money. Irish
is a born fighter, a clear and forceful
writer, a logical reasoner and a giaceful
and persuasive speaker. He will make
things lively in the Democratic camp as
soon as be takes off.liis shirt-collar and
begins to lift up his voice. By a humor
ous chance the delegation, which, as every
one knows, is pledged for free coinage,
came from California here in the Pullman
palace-car Â£1 Oro (the gold). Tbe delega
tion has been quizzed very rauch over the
silver contingent being brought from Cali
fornia in a gold car.
The badges of the delegation are both
rich and beautiful, being of purple and
irold. plush and satin, trimmed with gold
bullion surmounted by a silver bear and
a copy of the Great Seal of California
done in silver. There will be as great a
demand for thoae badges by visitors as
there was for the badges worn by the Cali
fornia delegation to the Republican con
vention at St. Louis. The Republicans
bad a simple strip of white satin ribbon
printed in cold with a golden bear. A St.
Lois newspaper reporter, misled by the
! weight ot the bear, published in his paper
that the bear and crossbar were of solid
gold and co-3t ?20 each, wholesale. This
statement caused a great rush to be made
for the badges. One delegate, overcome
by the muggy heat, fell asleep in front of
his hotel, and when he awoke he found
that his badge had been removed from the

Chicago, 111., July 5.)
It is conceded that Senator Harris of
Tennessee will be the permanent chair-
man of the convention, and he has made
his arrangements. He will make but a
very short speech in accepting the posi
tion, leaving it to tbe temporary chair
man to sound the keynote for the conven
tion.
Free silver leaders who have been se
lected by the respective delegations as
members of the committee on resolutions
and others who will undoubtedly form a
part of that important organization have
to-day been conferring together with re
spect to the text of the platform and the
subjects that shall be mentioned therein.
As heretofore stated in these dispatches,
this plank is to dominate the whole plat
form and all other matters are to be sec
ond thereto. The exact text has not been
finally determined, but that is a matter of
detail that can be easily arranged when
the committee gets together. That it will
be a short, clear-cut, concise declaration
for the free and unlimited coinage ol sil
ver at a ratio of 16 to 1 is a foregone con
clusion. Two short sentences are all that
will be necessary to construct this plank.
The indications are tbat those who bave
hoped the platform would ignore other
matters will bt> disappointed. Well-known
men among those in control of convention
matters assert that the tariff question
must not be overlooked. While there is a
diversity of opinion as to the advisability
of comini: out in a fiat-footed indorsement
of the Wilson tariff act, that law, bearing
the ptamp of Democracy, will be inci
dentally indorsed at least. If the United
States Senators are permitted to have
their way the platform will declare that
the present tariff law should remain un
touched until the exigencies of the occa
sion prove that its modification is abso
lutely necessary.
Whether the income tax, which was de
clared to be unconstitutional by the Su
preme Court, shall be referred to is a
question upoi which there is a very great
difference of opinion. The majority of
the leaders, however, appear to be in
favor of recognizing the principle that be
came a part of the Wilson tariff act, and a
determined effort is to be made by dele
eates from some of the Western and
Southern States to secure an expression
on the subject. If they fail it will be be
cause the agitation of the subject is not
deemed to be expedient, and not because
the majority of the party are against it.
The administration will not be men
tioned in the platform. Some of the more
radical of the silver men want an emphatic
condemnation of the financial policy of
President Cleveland and Secretary Carlisle
inserted in tbe platform, but it is believed
that while the administration will escape
censure the convention will likewise refuse
to commend it, and that any substitute
the >;old men may offer will be voted down
by the solid free-silver vote of the conven
tion.
There was a great deal of talk to-day
favorable to a plank that smacks very
largely of what is known as jingoism. In
a conversation this afternoon a delegate
who ha* been selected as a member of the
committee on resolutions, and who will in
all probability be its chairman, said thai
the Democratic party had always been the
American - party, and -ii- wni oiÂ»!y during
the administrations of President Cleveland
that the Americanism of the party had
been cast aside. It was therefore quite
likely that the 'foreign ' policy of the pres
ent administration, by indirection at least,
would be repudiated. ...
If the programme agreed upon by these
gentlemen does not go amiss the sympathy
of the Democratic party will be expressed
for suffering Cuba and a demand made for
the recognition of its independence. It is
not impossible that the desire to "ever
things up" with the administration may
lead to the adoption of a plank on this
subject that will be equally strong as that
adopted at St. Louis.
MODERN SHIPPING LAWS.
Commissioner Chamberlain Sub-
mits a Paragr.-.ph for the Chi
cago Platform.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â Hon. E. T.
Chamberlain, Commissioner of Naviga
tion, has sent to ex-Congressman Fithian,
an Illinois delegate, the following para
graph to be inserted in the convention
platform:
We demand that henceforth modern and lib
eral policies toward American shipping shall
take the place of our imitations of the restrict
ive statute* of King George 111, long ago aban
doned by every maritime power but the United
States.
To this end we favor the repeal of those ob
jci'iiotiable laws which now, to the Nation's
humiliation, bave driven American capital
and enterprise to the use of alien flags and
alien crews, have made the stars and stripes
an almost unknown emblem in ioreign ports,
and have- virtually extinguished the race of
American seamen.
We oppose the pretense that discriminating
dnticswill promote shipping; that scheme is
an Invitation to commercial warfare upon the
United States, on-American in tne light of our
great commercial treaties, offering no gain
whatever to the American shipping while
greatly increasing ocean freights on our agri
cultural and :&rm products.
WANTS BUT ONE PLANK.
John R. McLean Says " Free Silver
and Less Misery" Should Be
the Party Slogan.
CHICAGO, 111., July sâ John R. Mc-
Lean favors eliminating the tariff issue
from the campaign. In an interview
printed in a morning paper here he says:
"If I could write the Democratic plat
form it would be: 'Free silver â get there.
I would make it one bold stroke and quit
right there. What the people want is
more money and less misery. They care
nothing about the tariff question; they
are not worrying much about Cuba; they
do not care a cent about the Nicaragua
Canal. They want action on this money
question and are looking to this conven
tion as a drought-stricken farmer looks for
ram.
"We don't want a platform. All we
need is a plank, and the briefer the plank
thÂ«) better. Declare for free silver at 16 to
1, name the Presidential ticket, go home
and the people will do the rest. The peo
ple care for nothing else. Let us not mis
lead them by adopting a platform with a
lot of rot about Cub a, Armenia, China,
Venezuela, the Monroe doctrine and all
that sort of thing. Free silver, 16 to 1;
more money, less misery, independence of
Wall street and England. That is the
kin<l of an issue the people demand and
this convention is toing to give it to them.
"A free-s Uver ticket will sweep Â©hio,"
said Mr. McLean. "Ohio is not a cold
standard State. The Greenbackers have
curried Ohio twice, and every Green
backer in tbe State is for free silver. I
don't believe the Republicans will elect
three Congressmen in Ohio at this elec
tion."

If Recommended by the National Com

Headquarters United Press, 1
Herald Building, >
Chicago, 111., July 5.)
The crisis in National Democratic pros
pects will probably be reached to-morrow.
It may be precipitated by the decision of
the National Committee as to the tem
porary chairman of the convention. There
is a well-grounded belief to-night that the
sound-money men of that committee will
recommend to the convention that Sen
ator David H. Hill of New \ork be the
temporary presiding officer.
The knowledge that this was the inten
tion of the committee is said to furnish
the explanation of Mr. Hill's absence from
the gold men's mass-meeting last night.
He has thus escaped the denunciations
which the silver men at the Sherman
House have lavished with nnsparing
tongues to-day upon ex-Governor Flower,
Senator Gray, Mr. MacVeagh and District
Attorney Fellows for their participation
in that gathering.
There is an openly expressed desire on
the part of the silver men to force tbe
fight in the beginning upon the temporary
chairmanship, and George Fred Williams
of Massachusetts, one of the latest acces
sions to the silver ranks, is spoken of as a
desirable Eastern man to put forward in
antagonism to Senator Hill. The sound
money men are willing, and Senator Hill
is said to be eager to have tbe fighl opened
on this issue. They assert that to antag
onize the recommendation of a National
committee in the matter of temporary or
ganization would be such a breach of
Democratic tradition and usage that no
convention could reasonably be expected
to sanction it by its deliberate vote.
Senator Harris of Tennessee appears to
be penerally accepted as the majority's
choice for permanent chairman. If he
should take the chair it is thought he will
excuse himself from making any set
speech on the plea that recent sickness
has left his physical strength somewhat
impaired.
The leading booms continue in full
view. "Silver Dick" Bland's trumpeters
are making tbe most of the promised ac
cession of Illinois' forty-eight votes to
their standard and claim his nomination
is assured. The Boies men are not here
yet in full force. His boomers are to
arrive in two sections to-morrow, when
they will supply plenty of enthusiasm.
Meantime, the Tellerites profess such
absolute confidence in the nomination and
election of the Colorado Senator (though
his own State delegation stands committed
to Boies) that they are already bar
gaining for a partition of the spoils of
WHITE KILLS HIS OWN BOOM
office between the original Teller men
and their Democratic allies. Mr. McLean
continues to be named very extensively
for either first or second place and has ap
parently gained considerable strength j
during the day.
Considerable opposition is developing to
holding of any caucus to determine in ad
vance of the meeting of the convention
what shall be the course of the silver men. j
Supporters of Senator Blackburn's can- I
didacy took the lead in declaring their in
tention to refuse to enter any such caucus.
They want the convention to settle the
matter and they promise to abide by its
decision.
HILL WILL NOT YIELD.
Determined to Permttthe Presenta- |
tlon of His Name for Tem
porary Chairman.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â Senator Hill
was waited upon to-day by a number of
prominent silver men, who used all sorts
of arguments to induce the New York Sen
ator to withhold permission for the use of
his name as temporary chairman by the
National Committee. Among the callers
were Senators Vest and Cockrell of Mis
souri, White of California and Walsh of
Georgia and other active silver men. Sen
ator Hill was told xhat it wou:d be unwise
to allow his name to be presented only to
be bowled over by the silver majority,
which is expected ti rule the convention.
Hill listened respectfully to all argu
ments presented, and iras unaffected in i
his position by what was said to him. He i
declined to make any statement for publi- j
cation as to bis attitude, but others close !
to him said that he was not the man to
give up a fight on the eve of battle.
It is believed that Senator Hill is the
only man who can prevent a bolt by the
Bound-money men of the East if a free
silver platform is adopted and a free-silver
man nominated by tbe convention, and
that if the Senator were to bow to the !
wishes of tbe silver leaders and refuse the \
use of his name by the National Committee I
for temporary chairman he would no \
longer be in a position to check a bolt of j
tbe gold delegates. The efforts of the j
silver men may therefore be set down as |
ineffectual.
If tne National Committee at its meeting '\
to-morrow decides to present the name of ;
Mr. Hilllfo? temporary chairman it may!
be authoritatively stated that Senator Hill i
will stand, and that the overthrow of the j
programme mapped out by the National
Committee will bring matters to a head ,
between the gold and silver men at the j
opening of the convention Tuesday.
The gola men know a test vote must be j
met, and many of them believe it best to |
meet it on the selection of a temporary :
chairman, with all the precedents of regu- J
larity on their side, than to have the issue j
presented on more even terms later on. ',
They question the ability of the silver
men to hold their men together on a vote !
to overthrow the decision of the National j
Committee and to turn down a man who
deserves so well of his party as David B.
Hill. Such an irregular beginning to the j
convention, followed by other arbitrary
acts by the majority, the gold men claim, t
would fully justify them in bolting and .
refusing their support to the nominee.
Senator Hill shook bands with hundreds
of nis friends during the day. He had a I
word of cheer and encouragement for all j
who are trying to stay the drift toward i
free silver. He said he believed the unit |
rule on States and the 'two-thirds rule on I
nominations â both the honored customs
of the Democratic partyâ would stand in
this convention.
He said all talk about there being one
free silver man in the New YorK delega
tion was non?ense; that each and every I
man from the Empire State was for gold, I
and they would all vote for gold, even if
the unit rnle was done away with.
The sound money deleeates from Michi
gan called on Senator Hill at his bead
quarters this evening. The Senator re
ceived the delegation very cordially. El
liott Â£. Stevenson, on behalf of the dele
gation, told Mr. Hill that the gold men of
Michigan were with him and would fight
for the cause of sound money to the end.
Mr. Hill said he was glad to have such
faithful advocates of the cause and hoped
success would crown the fight.
"We are all working to that end," said
the Senator, "and we will at least put up
a glorious right."
At the conclusion of the interview the
Michigan delegates gave three cheers for
the New York Senator.

Says a Bo t on the Part of the Gold
Delegates Is One of the

"The Call's" Headquarters, )
Great Northern Hotel, >
Chicago, July 5.)
We arrived in Chicago at 8 o'clock this
morning and plunged immediately into
the fight. Its intensity has not been over
stated. Each side suspects the other and
acts upon the suspicion. A majority of
the National Committeeare gold men, and
they are determined to insist upon nam
ing a gold man for temporary chairman.
Senator Hill of New York was selected for'
the position.
As soon as this became known to the*
silver men they appointed a committee'
consisting of Senator Cockerell of Mis
souri and Senator White of California to*
wait upon Hill and warn him that they
would resist and overturn the appointment
of any gold advocate to that place.
The committee, as diplomatically as
possible, said that in the present temper
of the silver men his selection was out of
the question. Hill thereupon declined tho>
proffered appointment, and the National
Committee tendered the place to Senator
White. This was a great surprise, and
placed White in a very embarrassing posi
tion. To accept it after indxicing Hill tor
decline was out of the question, so he posi
tively declined the honor.
I understand that the temporary chair
man has not yet been selected.
No apparent change has occurred in the
relative strength of the leading candidates)
for President. Bland is still in the lead,
but not far enough to insure his nomiila
tion. The Utah delegation met to-day
and agreed to vote as a unit for Bland.
The California delegation met, but tools
no action on that question. It elected W.
W. Foote chairman and Harry E. WisÂ»
secretary by acclamation.
I called up the resolution of thÂ»
State convention instructing the delega
tion to present the name of White for
President, if opportunity should offer.
After considerable discussion, most of it
in favor of this action, Senator White took
the lluor and vehemently protested against
the proDOsition to place him in nomina
tion, saying that the circumstances did
not justify it.
"There is no apparent chance of suc
ceeding," said the Senator, "and in my
opinion, viewed from a purely personal
standpoint, it would not add to the creat
honor conferred upon me by the State
convention to have the California delega
tion and a few goldbugs, or even miMiy
geld bugs, vote for me in the National con
vention. In my opinion it would be a dis
aster to have our candidate, whoever he
may be, nominated by the votes of gold
delegates, and it certainly would not bo
much of an honor for an unsuccessful can
didate to be given votes from that source."
The matter was thereupon dropped for
the present by the delegation.
The selection of committeemen, includ
ing a National Comraitteeman, was post
poned until to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock. The fight for National Commit
teeman has narrowed down to Tarpey and
Dwyer, with the chances very stronsily in
favor ot the latter. Joe has become very
popular with the young men of the dele
gation and they are in control.
Before adjourning the delegation lis2
tened to a vtry adroit aiid well-tempered
speech by Frank Newlands iv favor of the
nomination of Teller. Mr. Smith, one of
the National leaders of the Populist party,
i 9 to be heard on the same subject to-mor
row.
A Bland conference has been called for
10 o'clock to-night to prepare for pushing
the fight for "Silver Dick" with increased
vigor to-morrow. It is, saitl that Bland's
fight is better organized than any of the
others.
The next twenty-four hours will be
eventful â they will certainly be so for in
dividual? and probably for tbe country as
well as tbe party. A bolt on the part of
the gold delegates is one of the probabili
ties, but it is quite uncertain at what stage
of the proceedings it will occur. If it does
not occur the silver men will suspect that
they have fallen into some error. The
gold men, however, may decide that their
greatest power for harm is within the
parly. James G. Maguire.
TELLERITES GROW BOLD.
Dictating the Terms Upon Which
Their Leader Would Accept the
Nomination.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â The Teller
men to-day began to define their policy.
They are growing more enthusiastic as the
time draws nearer, and are making defi
nite claims as to the strength of their can
didate. They have prepared a statement
showing the number of electoral votes
which they claim will be obtained if
Teller is made the choice of the conven
tion. This statement is being used to in
fluence Teller sentiment among the dele
gates.
Congressman Bailey of Texas, a delegate
at large and one of the Bland leaders, has
also prepared a statement giving the num
ber of electoral votes the Democrats may
bope to secure, but his figures fall far be
low those prepared by the Teller faction.
The two statements have been compared
and the Teller people are saying thai the
Bland men and supporters of other candi
dates pledged to free silver are very much
impressed with Teller's alleged strength.
The Teller statement gives tbe Colorado
man 256 electoral votes, while Mr. Bailey's
foots up only 197. The Teller men have
been very frank with the Democratic sil
ver leaders. They will not concede tbe
right of the Democratic party to dictate
tbe entire programme to be followed in
the event of the Colorado Senator's nomi
nation and election, and are trying to
reach an understanding on these points
before the convention assembles. One or
the most promiaent Teller men, who has
been in frequent conference with the
Democratic leaders, told a United Press
reporter to-day that the Teller people
would not consent to any proposition as
to the position they would occupy in the
event of his election, except such as would
give them a proportionate share in the ad
ministration of the Government, based on
the number of electoral vote 3 they secured
for the candidate.
Mr. Teller's friends insist that he is the
only man who can carry the country
for free silver. It is on this distinct and
broad statement that they base their de
mands on the Democratic silver leaders.
They are endeavoring to effect an agree
ment with the Democratic leaders as to
the platform on which Mr. Teller can
make the race. They want, of course, to
make the financial plank the main feature
and subordinate everything else to it.
"The platform will be satisfactory to
everybody," said Representative Hartman
of Montana, who bolted the St. Louis Con
vention with Mr. Teller, and who is here
looking after the Teller interests. "No
body can find fault with it and if Mr.
Teller is nominated, as he will be, it will
sweep the country."
Federal office-holders are beginning to
come in, but whether or not they will tafce
any part in the proceedings has not yet
developed.
Last night's mass-meeting of the gold
men was a remarkable demonstration
from the standpoint of attendance and of
the noted men who spoke or were present
a? spectators. The absence of Senator Hill
is causing much comment. Mr. Hill was
asked to attend and make a speech, but he
declined point blank to do either. Rumors
as to his reasons for declining to serve are
numerous, but Mr. Hill is not gratifying
the curiosity of those who desire to know
the truth. \
BRYAN'S CANDIDACY.
Nebraska Free Sllverites Will Make
a Hard Fight for the White-
Metal Champion.
LINCOLN, Nebk., July 5. â The Ne
braska free-silver delegation to the Chi
cago Convention, headed by ex-Congress
man W. J. Bryan and an enthusiastic
crowd of r-shouters, left this morning
over the Northwestern and -will make a
speedy run to the lake city. There were
fourteen cars, all gayly decorated, and be
fore Missouri Valley was reached it was
expected they would be crowded. All the
delegates, Mr. Bryan included, were conn
dent of securing seats in the convention,
as opposed to the contesting gold faction
already on the ground, beaded by Na
tional Committeeman Tobias Castor and
backed by Secretary of Agriculture Mor
ton.
After this preliminary fight is settled to
their satisfaction, as the free-silver men
confidently predict it will be, members of
the Nebraska delegation will begin a can
vass looking to Mr. Bryan as a Presi
dential candidate, and they make no
effort to conceal the fact that it will be
pushed with energy, and that is the sole
mission of the large [ number of visitors
aside from the delegates and: alternates
who accompanied their leader. The move
ment would have .begun sooner had Mr.
Bryan given his consent. His friends
point to him as one of the foremost cham
pions of the white metal in the West, who
would be an ideal leader.

Marching Clubs Arrive.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â While Chica
go does not appear to realize that the
great political convention is drawing near,
there were some lively scenes in the streets
and the hotel lobbies during the day. The
Randall Club of Pittsburg was the first of
the marching clubs to arrive. The Ran
dallites came 110 strong and were headed
by their own brass band. They have
headquarters at Myer's Hotel. The Bland
Club of St.. Louis, led by a woman, seated
astride of a prancing horse, marched up
Michiean avenue to its quarters and was
greeted with cheers. The list of United
States Senators who will attend the con
vention is still growing. Three additional
Senators arrived to-day â Senator Blan
chard of Louisiana and Senators Gordon
and Bacon of Georgia.
Utah Is for Bland.
CHICAGO, 111.. July s.â The Utah dele
gation met this afternoon and elected O.
W. Powers chairman and A. W. McCane
member of the National Committee. It was
voted to support Bland for the Presiden
tial nomination. One of the delegates,
however, said lie did not believe the
friends of Mr. Bland would hold a caucus
to agree upon a silver candidate in ad
vance. Tnat, he thought, was a question
which should be left for tbe convention to
decide with all the States represented.

Chicago, 111. , July 5. )
There is no change in tbe situation
here to-night. There seems to be a
scramble on the part of Western dele
gates to get into the Bland wagon. It
was given out at the headquarters of the
Missourian to-night that he would con
trol every State and Territory west of
the y\ iÂ» .i-.-ip|ii River, vrith the possible
exception of South Dakota.
The name of Stephen M. White will not
be presented to the National Convention
for the Presidency if the Californian can
prevent it. The Senator is not ambitious
to enter the contest-
All the California delegates are seem
ingly friendly to Bland. Barry Hillard
of Idaho has just informed me that the
delegates from that State will vote for
Bland on the first ballot. The fact that
Illinois and Colorado united on Bland
greatly increased the prospects of the
Missouri farmer for the nomination. The
Blaiid Club, which arrived from St. Louis
to-day, is making the night hideous with
cries for the noted silverite.
The leaders of the gold wins: of the
party retired to roost early to-night and
the silverites are in possession of the
field of battle The silver members of
the Xational Democratic Comimittee to
night decided on Senator White of Cali
fornia as temporary chairman of the con
vention, but the Senator was obliged to
decline the honor, for the reason that he
had urged Senator Hill of New York not
to accept the position and he said it
'would look like a selfish move on his
own behalf io take the chair.
The National Democracy came a little

FAR IN THE LEAD.
Bland Forces Gain New Accessions
While Boies Is Making no
Advance.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â Bland is the
only candidate "vrho is seriously men
tioned by the silverites as the prob
able nominee of the Democratic Na
tional Convention, which is called to meet
at the Coliseum on Tuesday. There is no
question but that the farmer-statesman of
Missouri is still the ideal candidate of that
element of the party which will dominate
the National Democracy. While Boies is
being widely supported by Towa and a few
scattering delegates from other sections of
the country he has not gained sufficient
strength to nave any pronounced bearing
upon the situation of yesterday. The fact
is that his trip to Chicago diminished
rather than increased his prospects. The
little excitement aroused over his uncere
monious entrance into the city soon wore
away.
On the other hand, the Bland boom
withstood the many vicious assaults that
were made upon its breastworks during
the day and long into the night. It was
expected that Bland would hang up his
hay-rake and hurry to Chicago, simply
because the lowan had been summoned
here by his advisers for a consultation;
but tbe Missourian sent word that he was
obliged to remain at home to gather in his
hay crop, and therefore he could not come
to the great city by the lake at this time to
attend to such a trifling matter as the
prospective nomination for the Presidency
of the United States. Bland will not be
in Chicago this week. Shoald he receive
the nomination of his party for the Presi
dency, he will remain at Lebanon until
notified of the fact.
There is some talk to-day of a Bland-
McLean ticket. The Ohio editor seems to
have no particular preference for a first
place so long as he comes in second. A
day or two ago his friends were urging
him for the Vice- Presidency, with Senator
Teller of Colorado as the Presidential
nominee. When the Teller boom had run
its race McLean shifted over to the Bland
contingent. There is little prospect that
he will be in any way recognized by the
National Democracy.
United States Senator SJephen M. White
of California, whose familiar face was seen
about the political centers to-day, and ex-
Governor Sylvester Pennoyer of Oregon
are among those who are being promi
nently mentioned to-day for tecond place
on the Democratic ticket. Either would
be acceptable to the silver wing of the
partyâ that wing of the Democracy which
incorporates the South and West in a solid
phalanx for the free and unlimited coin
age of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1. White is
looked upon with considerable favor by
the leaders of the party from different sec
tions of the country, and the rumor that
New York would support his aspirations
for Presidential honors gave additional
force to his boom.
Pennoyer lost no ground to-day. His
pictures are being promiscuously circu
lated by delegates to the convention, and
the virtues and glories of his public and
private life are being recited in song and
story.
The gold men have been completely van
quished. Their meeting at the Auditorium
last night failed to bring about desired re
sults. True, the building was crowded
from pit to dome with enthusiastic; sup
porters of the yellow metal.
They cheered the sentiments of the
various speakers, and yelled long and loud
for their favorite candidates. But it was
all to no avail, for when the sun rose over
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 6, 1896.
SOME OF THE MEN WHO ATTRACT ATTENTION IN CHICAGO.
Chicago this Sabbath morning there was
even a more pronounced outburst of bit
terness among the silver men toward
their avowed enemies, and the now famil
iar cry of "16 to 1" was again sent career
ing along the ramparts.
Whitney and Hill have absolutely given
up the fight. They readily concede that
the silver men will dominate the conven
tion. They have no heart to maKe the
fight. With bowed heads and sad hearts
they accept tho inevitable. They are sin
cere in the opinion that the party will be
defeated upon a silver platform.
While there is much talk of a bolt on the
part of the Eastern delegates, final action
has been delayed. It is evident, however,
that the National Dcmocrecy, which has
lived throughout the convulsions of a cen
tury, is now swaying in the balance of un
certainty. Will it survive the crisis now
at hand? Will it perish in the throes of
sectional strife? These are the questions
of the hour. Feakk McGtibe.
"SILVER DICK" BLAND.
Character of the Man Who Seems
Destined to Ge-. the Nom
ination
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â "Silver Dick"
Bland.
He is the leader and his supporters de
clare that he will surely be the nominee of
the National Democratic Convention. The
Missourian will lead all candidates on the
first ballot. The Bland men are claiming
350 votes for him. Boies is his closest
competitor; in fact only these two seem to
be in tbe race. Matthews of Indiana will
receive the thirty votes of his State as a
compliment merely. His candidacy is not
regarded as serious.
Senator Vest of Missouri, a conservative
man, said to-night he fell sure of Bland's
nomination. It looks like Bland against
the field to-night. Delegates are slow to
arrive, however, ana it is too early to make
a sale prediction.
The two-thirds rule will certainly pre
vail, and the supporters of Mr. Bland's
rivals declare that the Missourian can
never secure theiequisite number of votes.
The Democratic party is indeed in a sad
plight. It is resolved to nominate a radical
silverite. The strong men of the party are
administration supporters, and there is no
one north of Mason and Dixon's line men
tioned for the nomination on a silver plat
form but Bland, Boies, Matthews and
Stevenson. Tne silver Democrats at the
convention confess mortification that they
have a Bhahby lot of candidates to offer.
"Silver Dick's" visaze is posted in the
corridors of all hotels and on the dead
walls of all Chicago streets. At the Palmer
House numberless index fingers on ban
ners point the way to "Silver Dick's"
neadquarters.
Some Typical Faces Seen About the Hotels.
Bland buttons are scattered broadcast
Incoming country delegations, headed by
noiÃy brass bands, are yelling for Bland.
Bland, Bland; the mob, the groundlings,
split the ears of the multitude while the
judicious grieve, for although the rnral
rooters regard Bland as a great silver
Moses, -whose statesmanship will lead to
better times, the leaders of the party who
know Bland personally are doubtful of the
wisdom of nominating a man of his
character.
Richard Parks Bland, after many years
as Representative in Congress, made him
self conspicuous by his persistent efforts
in behalf of tbe siiver dollars, as joint
author of the Bland-Allison act. Though
a member of Congress for many years he
has seldom uttered a word on any subject
other than finance and like Stewart of
Nevada be knows little else.
Mr. Bland is a man of unimposing and
unattractive physique, ordinary height,
his face covered with a growth ol grizzly
gray hair. His head is slightly bald. The
Missouri statesman is an inveterate chewer
of tooacco, as evidenced by his tobacco
streaked beard. He is ol a meditative
mind, and when in a thoughtful mood,
with a far-away look in his eyes, toya with
his brows or his nasal appendage.
Though Senator White has declined to
be a Presidential candidate there is still
some talk of submitting his name to tbe
convention. Mr. White's nomination is
by no means an impossibility. Indeed,
some of his warm admirers and enthusi
astic supporters declare that he stands an
excellent chance as a dark horse in the
event of a sharp fight between Bland and
Boies. C. C. Cabletok.
BLAND MEN CAUCUS.
Two Hundred and Fifty Votes
Promised to the Missouri
Candidate.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â The first gen
eral caucus of delegates and alternates
favcrable to the candidacy of Mr. Bland
was held in the Sherman House this even
ing. The object of the Bland managers
was to get acquainted with the delegates
lrom other States than Missouri, then be
gin the work of formulating the conven
tion plan of procedure rather than to
make a full test of Bland's strength.
Twelve States responded to the rollcall,
about 100 delegates instructed for the Mis
sourian being present. From the figures
sent to the decretary, 250 unconditional
votes were put down as a certainty on the
first ballot.
Most of the delegates were around the
hotel, but only a few attended the caucus.
Texas and Kansas were largely repre
sented. Secretary Allen of the Bland ex
ecutive committee of Missouri called the
caucus to order. Senator Martin of Kan
sas was chosen chairman. Dr. L. J. Dee"
shiel of Texas was elected secretary.
A few vigorous speeches were made on
the outlook from Missouri's point of view,
and there was no lack of enthusiasm.
Congressman Bailey said the solid thirty
votes of the Lone Star State would be cast
for Bland. Mr. Overmeyer of Kansas said
his State was for Mr. Bland, because no
other Democrat could carry the State in
November. Secretary of State Hinrichsen
announced a majority of the Illinois dele
gation for Bland, and said that under the
unit rule the forty-eight votes of his State
would be cast for the free-silver pioneer of
the party.
There was little but Bland talk in the
Sherman House when tbe delegates
swarmed in, and the Missounan's man
agers were elated over a report that twelve
of the Tennessee delegates haa been won
over to je Bland persuasion. The other
half are inclined to Blackburn and Mc-
Lean. Governor Culberson of Texas and
Governor Stone of Missouri came to look
in at the caucus and meet delegates and
friends.
A letter was read from San Francisco,
stating that a silver club composed of Re
publicans, Populists and Democrats was
being formed, 1000 strong, whose choice
was Bland for President and Morgan of
Alabama, White of California or Sibley ot
Pennsylvania for V ice-President.
BLAND'S FIGURES.
Claims Two Hundred and Thirty
Votes on the First Ballot.
CHICAGO. 111., July s.â The following
Bland figures were given out to-night to
the United Press to indicate the practi
cally certain strength of the Missouri can
didate on the first ballot:
Arkansas. 16 ft ah 6
Colorado 8 Wnshington 8
Idaho 6 Wyoming 6
Illinois 48( Arizona. 6
Kausas 20New Mexsco 6
Missouri 44 Indian Territory 6
Montana BlOltlahoma 6
Oregon 8
Texas 30| Total 230
This summing up of Mr. Bland's sup
porters is thirty-two votes below the esti
mate given at tne afternoon caucus of the
Bland delegates.
MICHIGAN'S CONTEST.
Talk of a Compromise Between the
Quarreling: Wolverine Dele
grates.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â One of the in
teresting developments of the day was
that of a possible compromise in the mat
ter of the contest over the Michigan dele
gation. The silver men feel that while
they were outgeneraled in the Wolverine
State by ex-Postmaster-General Don M.
Dickinson, a large majority of the Demo
cratic party of that State are supporters
of the free coinage of silver, and there has
been some talk of attempting to oust the
Dickinson delegation, replacing them by
one in favor of free coinage.
Ihe proposition suggested to-day was
that the delegation should be voted by
Mr. Dickinson in favor of a platform de
claring for a maintenauce of the gold
standard, and that afterward the indi
vidual preferences of the delegates for
President should 1 be recorded.
There was some objection upon the part
of the silver men to the execution of this
compromise. They argued that it would
be foolidh to enter into such an arrange
ment, for the reason that the delegation
was bound by instruction of the State
Convention to act under the unit rule, and
that, after the twenty-eight votes would be
recorded in favor of tne gold standard, no
power existed in the convention itself to
release the delegation from its obligation
to observe the directions of the State Con
vention and tbe majority could still cast
the twenty-eight votes against a free-silver
candidate.
BAILEY FOR CHAIRMAN.
The Texan Favored by Utah Dele-
sates for Temporary Holder
of the Gavel.
CHICAGO, 111., July 5.â A movement
to secure the election of J. W. Bailey of
Texas as temporary chairman of the con
vention was inaugurated at the meeting of
the Utah delegation to-day. His name
had previously been suggested by advo
cates of free silver, and during tne after
noon, it was stated, the di legations of
several of the Northwestern States indi
cated a willingness to unite in support of
Mr. Bailey.
The Texas Congressman, from reports,
does not desire to enter into the contest
for the position, while recognizing the
honor that his selection would confer
upon him and bis State. He has been
under the care of a physician for throat
trouble for some time and fears that his
condition is not such as to justify him in
undertaking the duties of tae position.
General A. J. Warner, president of the
Bimetallic League and a former Demo
cratic Congressman from Ohio, is one of
Mr. Bailey's most enthusiastic supporters.

GOLD MEN WILL BOLT,

lapel of his coat by an unscrupulous per
son who wished to keep it as a souvenir of
the land of gold and fruits and flowers, of
sunshine and skies perennially blue.
Some other of the delegates presented
their badges to their admiring friends in
St. Louis, with the admonition to be care
ful and not lose such a priceless treasure,
and to this day tbe deiighted recipients
are exhibiting to their friends with the
greatest pride badges that cost exactly
$2 20 each.
It is too early for the delegates yet to
size up the situation and to definitely
make up their mini as to what course
they shall pursue. They are pledged on
the financial proposition, but unpledged
as to candidates. The Californians were in
caucus from 3 to 5 o'clock this afternoon.
What they did that is proper for the pub
lic to hear will be told in another column
in this issue of The Call by Congressman
Maguire, whose words are of more than
ordinary weicht and value in the councils
of the Democracy.
The gold meeting in tie Auditorium
last night developed the fact that the
thread which binds the sound money men
to the party is as brittle as a spider's web.
They hurled defiance in the teeth of the
majority and as good as said that they
would not support the party in the com
ing campaign. From various surface in
dications it will not be very wide of the
mark to say tliat there is a very strong
probability that there will be some
dramatic scenes before the session of
the convention shall have come to an end
and that the New York delegation and
other sound money advocates will make a
united bolt and walk-out that will leave a
big hole in the convention hall and that
will strike terror into the Democratic
heart.
The sappers and miners are at work ex
cavating under the Bland boom. Tbe lat
est missile aimed at it is the statement,
industriously put forward, that Silver
Dick would be a very unpopular candidate
because of his disagreeable personality.
They say he is rugged, coarse, uncouth
and unamiable; that whatever magnetism
he may have comes from the negative pole
and repels all who pet within its influence.
This is a pretty rough deal upon Dick.
Most politicians would prefer to be classed
as scoundrels, boodlers, thieves and pirates
than to be accused of being boorish or out
of style.
From the Teller boom comes the hissing
sound of escaping gas. It was never more
than a toy balloon, inflated to its utmost
capacity and pricked with a pin by some
mischivous urchin from New York.
The hotels are uncomfortably crowded,
and room-rent in them and on streets near
by has doublea and trebled. In the 25, 50
and 75-cent lodging-houses on State street,
WaDash avenue, Dearborn, Madison, Mon
roe, Adams and Jackson streets, within
easy access of political headquarters, rents
have been raised within the last two days
to $2 a day for one person.
The restaurants in the same vicinity
have not made much of an increase in
price for the reason that they are already
charging all that tbe traffic will bear, it
being next to impossible to get a "decent"
meal short of $1 at the lowest.
Frank D. Ryan, District Attorney of
Sacramento County, and Judge Garoutte
of the Supreme Court of the State of Cali
fornia, both of whom attended the Re
publican National Convention at St. Louis,
have returned from a trip to New York
and will remain here until Tuesday, when
they will start for California. Among the
otner Californians here are State Senator
Voorhies, L. L. Bromwell, the insurance
man; Colonel William Fursyth, one of
the largest raisin-growers in the Fresno
district; Will H. Gagan; Peter J. Dunne,

CHICAGO, 111., July s.â The fight over

by the hurried arrival of Michael F. Tar

days been laid on the issue whether the
I gold or t*ne silver men of the committee
j shall dictate the selection or the chairman
that Mr. Tarpey was overwhelmed with
telegrams urging his attendance in Chi
cago.
Nothing better shows the chaotic condi
tion of affairs here almost on the eve of the
j convention than the bitterness of the fight
over the temporary chairmanship.
Tne silver men of the National Commit
tee late this afternoon, through Senator
Pascoe, notified Mr. White that they had
unanimously selected him as their candi
date. The names of Blackburn and Bryan .
had been canvassed, but both had been
rejected. Of Mr. Blackburn the fear was
frankly expressed that under certain con
tingencies his eloquence might prove an
endless brook, and it is the programme of
the silver men to rush everything, includ
ing speeches, as promptly as possible.
Against Mr. Bryan it was urged that be
ing a member of a contesting delegation
tbere might be objection to selecting for
presiding officer a man whose status in
the convention was not without doubt.
The committee therefore selected Senator
White, who presided at St. Louis in 38â¬8
with distingu ; shed ability.
Mr. White briefly informed Mr. Pascoe
that, having only recently visited Mr.
Hill to dhsuade him from accepting the
nomination by the gold men, it would not
be possible for him to accept the selection
by the silver men. Pascoe assented to Mr.
White's views, and returned to the com
mittee to report Mr. White's refusal. The
silver men are consequently as far away as
ever from selecting the temporary chair
man of the convention.
Arthur Sewall, the National Committee
man from Maine, arrived to-day. He ex
presses his intention to vote for Mr. Teller,
whose name Senator Dubois says will
surely be placed in nomination. Mr.
Sewall favors a platform which shall ex
press itself for free coinage of silver at 16
to 1, with an incidental allusion to the
subject of the tariff.
Hon. Pat Walsh of Georgia says that the
â platform will contain a ringing denuncia
tion of the American Protective Associa
tion, as strong as the English language
can frame it. C. C. Cableton.
BOOMERS ARE BUSY.
Arriving Delegates Button-Holed
by Friends of the Several
Candidates.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â Just as the
Louisiana delegation was called to order
to-night in its headquarters at the Palmer
House it was visited by a representation
of the delegation from Texas, which was
out doing missionary work in behalf of
Candidate Bland. It had become well
known around the hotel that the Louisiana
delegation was undecided as to its prefer
ence for a Presidential candidate, and the
friends of the Missouri man have pressed
into service the Texas delegation, which
is here under instructions to labor and to
vote for Mr. Bland's nomination. One of
the Texan3 made an address of some
length, setting forth the reasons which, to
them, were considerably in favor of
Bland's nomination. '
Later the Louisiana delegates were vis
ited by Senators Dubois and Pettigrew
and Representative Town of Minnesota,
who is at the head of the free-silver bolt
ine Republicans of that State. These gen
tlemen called to impress upon the dele
gates the availability of Senator Teller as
a candidate.
Be} r ond electing Governor McEnery
chairman, the delegation did nothing at
the executive meeting ar.d adjourned un
til to-morrow at 11 o'clock.
The Massachusetts contingent, sixty
five strong, came in to-night, and with
them George Fred Williams, delegate-at
large, -whose recent utterances favorable
to silver have given much offense to the
Massachusetts gold men, who came ahead
of the delegation. Mr. Williams had no
sooner landed in town than rumor began
to associate his name with the temporary
chairmanship. There was a basis for the
rumors, for some of the Massachusetts
men say Mr. Williams is a candidate for
the position and relies for success on the
fact that he is an Eastern man whose pub
lic statements show him to be friendly to
tbe white metal.
Maryland's delegates arrived this after
noon and are registered at the Auditorium.
They held a brief meeting and filled the
places in the delegation made vacant by
those who refused to come to Chicago
after they had been elected. Ex-Congress
man J. Fred Talbott and Murray Vandiver
were subststuted for CharleÃ C. Crothers
and Marion de Kalb Smith. The Mary
land gold men are already being worked
on by the silver contingent. It is said
four of the Maryland delegates are for sil
ver, and the delegation is not bound by

Chicago, July 5. J
The gold Democrats who are supporting
William C. Whitney in the business which
has brought him to Chicago held an en
thusiaslie meeting to-night and discussed
matters of importance bearing on the
treatment they might expect in the con
vention from the dominant silver men.
The feature of the conference, which, like
that of Friday night, was conducted be
hind closed doors in the Auditorium
Hotel, was a speech delivered by Mr.
Whitney at the opening. He paid his
compliments to Governor Alteeld, who,
he claimed, was the dominating spirit
among the silverites, and ended his re
marks with this declaration, made in a
ringing voice:
"I take it for granted that no man in
this room will ever consent to the sub
ordination of the welfare of the country
and the integrity of his party for any con
sideration." Loud cheers followed.
There was really little business of im
portance at the conference. Its main pur
pose was to discuss the various contests
before the National Committee and to
listen to a statement from Mr. Whitney
as to what had been accomplished since
the gold men began their active fight. It
is estimated that over 225 persons were in
attendance, the room being inadequate to
hold the assemblage. Among tlie first to
arrive were sixty Indianans wearing con
spicuous badges bearing the inscription
"Indiana sound-money Democrats." Two
sergeants-at-arms were placed at the door,
and as each man entered he was subjected
to close scrutiny. Two followers of the
silverites had passed within the precincts
of the conference-room, but were discov
ered in time and summarily ousted.
Among those in attendance were W. D.
Byuum, ex-Attorney-General A. G. Smith
of Indiana, William C. Whitney, ex-Gov
ernor Flower, ex- Lieutenant- Governor
Sheehan, Senator Gray, Don M. Dickin
son, ex-Mayor Thomas F. Gilroy, Judge
Funch of lowa, Colonel Harvey, Colonel
John W. Fellows, ex-Governor Russell of
Massachusetts, Controller Eckels, As
sistant Secretary of the Treasury Hamlin,
John E. Russell, William F. Harrity,
Cnairman of the National Democratic
Committee, Ben T. Cable, Smith M. Weed,
Franklin MacVeagh, Washington Hesing,
ex-liovernor Bradley, ex-Governor Francis,
Joseph Quincy, Robert F. Wright of Penn
sylvania and ex-Governor R. W. Knox of
Kentucky. Â«
Senator Gray of Delaware, who was
as permanent chairman of the
gold organisation at last Friday 's meet
ing, called the conference to order and
immediately thereafter Mr. Whitney
arose to address those who were present.
All of those in attendance were not dele
gates to the convention. A notable ab
sentee was Senator David B. Hill, who
was present at last Friday's conference,
but d'd not accept the invitation to ap
pear to-night.
Mr. Whitney prefaced hit remarks by a
brief statement of what the situation had
been at the conference held immediately
after his arrival in Chicago. At that time,
he said, the little information they had
tended to one inevitable conclusion â that
the free-silver men under Altgeld had
made up their minds to force their way
through the convention in every particu
lar and had also decided to do three
thingsâ first, to hold a caucus and select
t ieir candidate outside the convention
hall; second, to abrogate the two-thirds
rule, and, third, to make the result abso
lutely certain by "firing out" as many
gold delegates as the}- could possibly find
a pretext for dismissing.
Tney had also decided on another thing,
and that was to violate every precedent
of the party by refusing to accept as tem
porary chairman a man selected by the
National Committee and to put their own
man in his place. That, he said, was the
state of things at the last meeting.
"To-night," said Mr. Whitney, "it was
obvious that there had been a distinct set
back for the silver forces. Their plans
had been changed. The sentiment that
had been brought about since that time
through the efforts of the sound-money
Democrats here and the Democratic press
throughout the country was very marked.
As indicative of the change in the ilans
of the silver men they had undertaken io
hold a caucus, and the attempt failed;
they haii abandoned the idea of abrogat
ing the â¦.wo-thirds rule, and from the
best information that could be obtained
to-night they had decided not to carry out
their idea regarding the temporary chair
manship."
Mr. Whitney said the reports of what
the free silver men attempted to do to-day
were to the effect that division in their
own ranks made it impossible for them to
carry out their plans before the Na
tional Committee to-morrow. This was
the situation when they adjourned this
afternoon, "and there was little probabil
ity." he added, "that they would come to
the conclusions urged by Altgeld when the
committee met this morning."
Mr. Whitney said these things showed
a very pronounced change of sentiment.
It was the effect of the work through the
press, the public meeting here and ail
such agencies upon the managers of the
silver campaign. That they had been
convinced of the wisdom of not following
Mr. Altgeld was obvious. That lÂ«ft one
matter yet unfinished, said Mr. Whitney.
Having failed in the attempt to rea^h an
agreement to abrogate the two-thirds rule
Mr. Altgeld and his associates â Mr. Till
man and others â had demanded to throw
out enough gold men to make a majority
for silver in the National Committee.
There had been no change in this plan, he
said; in fact, everything indicated that
this sentiment was stronger than ever be
fore.
To indicate how far this matter went and
to emphasize and corroborate his state
ments, Mr. Whitney called on Mr. Steven
son, chMrman of the Michigan delegation,
whose seats are Deing contested, to state
his case. This Mr. Stevenson did at
length. He was asked numerous ques
tions about the Michigan contests by Wil
liam F. Sheehan and others. As a further
indication that the silver men had not
abandoned this particular idea and were
going to press it to a final conclusion in
lieu of abrogating the two-thirds rule, at
least six cases were instanced where dele
gates had been asked what position they
would take in regard to the Michigan del
egation in case they were put on the com
mittee on credentials. In each of these
cases, where the delegate answered that he
would judge of tbe merits of the case, but
could not judge without a hearing, he was
promptly turned down and a man put in
pledged absolutely to displace tbe mem
bers of the Michigan delegation who were
in favor of sound money.
At the conclusion of these narrations
Mr. Whitney remarked that the refusal to
admit the Michigan delegation to the con
vention would be as bad as the abrogation
of the two-thirds rule. It meant, he said,
so far as the Democratic party's organiza
tion was concerned, nothing less thnn
chaos and anarchy, and tie took it for
granted that no man in that room would
ever consent to such subordination of the
welfare of the country and integrity of the
party for any consideration.
The meeting was also addressed by Don
M. Dickinson. Controller Eckels, ex-
Governor Flower, Mr. Saulsbury of Dela
ware and Smith M. Weed of New York.
The conference heard statements about
contests from Missouri, Nebraska and the
Canton (Ohio) District These were
simply matters of information. At a late
hour the meeting adjourned.
ILLINOIS IS UNCERTAIN.
Bland May Not Get the Entire
Vote of Governor Altgeld's
Delegation. .
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â Governor Alt
geld did not bring the Illinois delegation
to a formal vote on a Presidential candi
date to-day, as expected. The Bland men
were disappointed and a trifle uneasy over
the situation as it rested to-night, after
two meetings and two adjournments of
the delegates during the day. The trouble
lies mainly with the anti-Bland men of the
Cook County (Chicaco) delegation. There
are fourteen of them who do not favor
Bland and prefer Boies almost to a man.
The Bland men of the delegation excuse
the failure of the two meetings to take
definite action by saying that some of the
delegates who are for Bland did not arrive
to-day, and, as the full delegation was not
present, it was deemed advisable not to
take a poll of the delegates until to-mor
row. The claim of the Bland men of the
delegation has been that thirty of the
forty-eiÂ»ht were with them, but there
were not that number at the Sherman
House to-day.
The first caucus was called for 10 o'clock,
Governor Altgeld presiding, and immedi
ately adjourned to 8 o'clock in the even
ing. At that time, after the Governor had
conferred with his confidential men, a
meeting was called informally and an
agreement was soon reached to adjourn
until to-morrow morning, when the ab
sentees will be on hand. The Boies men
had representatives outside the headquar
ters, and Secretary Walsh of the lowa
State Committee said he regarded the out
look as favorable to Boies. He showed
the United Press some telegrams from
Southern and Western delegates on their
way here which stated that a poll showed
some to be Boies supporters who had been
classed in the Bland column.
PREVENTS A CAUCUS.
Senator Vest Induces Missouri's
Delegation Not to Act Too
Hastily.
CHICAGO, 111., July s.â Maine led off
to-day in the matter of organization, her
delegation, which reached Chicago this
morning, organizing after breakfast. A
resolution was adopted authorizing the
chairman to confer with Mr. Whitney and
place the Maine delegation at the service
of the sound-money cause.
Mr. Holman, who is the Maine member
of the resolutions committee, said the
delegation was in favor of the nomination
of Mr. Whitney for President, but what it
would do in that regard could not be stated
until after the conference between Chair
man Gordon and Mr. Whitney.
The caucus of the Missouri delegation,
which was held last night, resulted in no
positive action further than the selection
of Senator Cockrell as a member of the
committee on resolutions. The candidacy
of Mr. Bland and the policy to be pursued
in order to make the work in his behalf as
effective as possible, was discussed from
10 o'clock until almost 1 o'clock this morn
ing, a number of very enthusiastic
speeches being made. Congressman Dear
mond advocated the indorsement by the
delegation of the caucus of the silver men
which had been proposed for the purpose
of determining who shall be the silver
candidate. This was antagonized by Sena
tor Vest; not for the reason, however, that
he was opposed to anything that Mr.
Bland's friends wanted, but because he
considered it bad policy at the present
time. In one of his characteristic speeches,
Vest called attention to the fact that
Bland was the leading candidate and
would in all probability be the choice of
the convention.
If the Missouri delegation were to take
the initiative in this matter its action
might be construed, Senator Vest said, as
an effort on the partof Missouri to unduly
hasten matters and take snap judgment in
favor of its candidate. It might also, he
feared, be unacceptable io delegations
Irom other States who had candidates to
come before the convention.
Senator Vest believed that the first steps
with respect to this proposed caucus
should be taken by the delegations pledged
to no particular candidate, and declared
that as soon as this was done Missouri
could properly participate in its proceed
ing. This advice was followed, and no
action was taken.
All the members of the Illinois delega
tion have not yet reached the city, but
those who are hereâ a majority of the
whole numberâ held a conference this
morning at the Sherman House. The
question of the indorsement of a candi
date was informally discussed, and it was
speedily ascertained that a vory large ma
jority of the whole delegation was favor
able to the nomination of Mr. Bland.
Formal action will not be had, however,
until the conierence of to-morrow. At
this time it is believed Mr. Bland, through
the operation of the unit rule, will be for
mally indorsed and members of the
various convention committees will be
selected.

WIRES TO BE KEPT WORKING.
Sparks Flying in So Many Directions
That a Magazine May Be

BERLIN, Germany, July s.â The Em
peror, before starting on his month's tour
of the North Sea on July 1, gave orders
which are unusual with his Majesty upon
such occasions â that wire communication
with Berlin should be kept intact through
out the route which he had mapped out
for his trip, and also gave instructions
that in the event of his going to any point
which was not linked in the telegraphic
circuit reaching Berlin, a dispatch boat
should be sent to that point with dis
patches and for the purpose of conveying
return communications to the nearest
telegraph station to be wired to Berlin.
Besides Count Philip yon Eulenberg,
German Embassador to Austria, the
Kaiser's suite is composed of Admiral yon
Henden-Bibran, chief of the Marine Cab
inet; the deputy chief of the Military
Cabinent, Count yon Moltke, Court Mar
shal Baron yon Lyncker, Counts Gortz
and yon Hulsen and Aides-de-camp yon
Kessel, yon Soholt, yon Arnim and yon
Moltke.
No repose is expected by any of the
Ministers during the tour of the Kaiser,
except in the case of the bead of the Home
Department, in which affairs are quieter
than in any other branch of the Govern
ment service. On the other hand, the
Foreign Office is in a state of anxiety over
the developments in Macedonia and Crete.
The Kreuz Zeitung, usually well in
formed upon official matters and particu
larly those connected with the Foreign
Department, claims to know upon au
thority that the Foreign Office is chiefly
concerned in the situation in Macedonia,
and that the alliance of Servia, Montenegro
and Bulgaria under the approval of Russia
means Russia's desertion of the Porte. If.
the Kreuz Zeitung adds, the rising in
Macedonia should become general, it will
check Austria's long-prepared advance to
Salonica, which port the Auslro-Hun
garian Government has coveted possession
of for years, and this would be likely to
involve war.
The officially inspired press in Berlin
touch the matter with a great deal of
diffidence. The Vienna Fremdenblatt, an
official organ, however, declares in an
article in its issue of yesterday that all of
the powers are desirous that the trouble
in Crete shall be settled at once, all of
them being aware that a general upheaval
in that island would lead to the breaking
up of the Turkish Empire. Therefore, the
Fremdenblatt continues, the powers are
determined to maintain the status quo at
all hazards. The paper adds that neither
a union of Crete with Greece nor the
granting of autonomy to the island, as
claimed by the Cretan radicals, will re
ceive the assent of the powers.
The Vossische Zeitung has ieceived ad
vices saying that the Turkish warships in
Cretan waters are totally impotent to pre
vent the landing of expeditions from
Greece and narrates the capture of the
Turkish torpedo-boot Edjer, by a party of
thirty-five Cretans. The Edjer, which waÂ»
built at Dantzic for the Turkish Govern
ment, was capable of developing a speed
of twenty-two miles an hour. She was
surprised during the night by a band of
Cretans who killed all of her crew except
one of her engineers, a German.
The Emperor's speech on the occasion of
the launching of the new German battle
ship Kais r Friedrich 111 at Wilhelm
shaven, last Wednesday, has met with an
echo of hearty approval throughout the
empire, which foreshadows popular assent
to a large increase of the German navy,
one of the Kaiser's desires.
The Tageblatt, in an article upon this
subject, expresses belief that the Reich
stag will certainly vote to grant the
requisite amount of money to create a
powerful navy and thus batisfy the wishes
of the Emyeror.
The Vorwaerts, the organ of the Social
ists, sneers at the Emperor's speech, par
ticularly at his references to his grand
father, Kuiser Wilhelm I. The paper
denies the Emperor's assertion that the
old Kaiser was adored by the people, and
declares that the Socialists especially have
reason to recollect the black shadows
which clouded the reign of that monarch.
In view of the audacious tone of the
Vorwaerts' article, it is not surprising that
the Ministry of Justice refuses to enter
tain the appeal of the Socialist, Herr
Kunert, who was recently elected to the
Reichstag from Halle, for an abridgment
of the term of imprisonment, which he is
now undergoing. Herr Kunert, as editor
of the Vorwaerts, was sentenced to prison
for obtaining and publishing a copy of the
Imperial decree of amnesiy issued upon
the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniver
sary of the foundation of the Empire in
advance of the official publication of the
document.
The Liberal and single-standard news-
papers express themselves as satisfied with
McKinley's sound-money declaration em
bodied in the platform adopted by the
Republican National Convention in St.
Louis.
The Vossische Zeitung. despite its fears
that there may be further high protection
legislation in the United States, hails the
nomination of McKiuley as a welcome
deliverance from many worse things that
could have happened.
The Tageblatt prints a homily upon
American politics, in which it declares
that the American corrupt plutocracy and
system of professional politics are bring
ing the United States to ruin, concluding
by saying: "It will be well if gold shall
win the day."

the manifold duties incident to the cam
paign to better advantage here than else
where. The people are still coming here
in large numbers to visit Major McKinley,
and there will be many hundreusof callers
this week and as many next. Last week
4000 people from out of town called upon
him in a single day. He shook hands
with all of them, and tbe ordeal did not
seem to fatigue him.
Most of the delegations who come to
Canton carry banners inscribed with the
words, "Protection," "Reciprocity,"
"Sound Money," and in many cases the
words "Patriotism and Prosperity" ap
pear in lurid letters on streamers and
banners.
Plans for the conduct of the impending
campaign are rapidly maturing â rapidly,
but not hurriedly. The work of the cam
paign will net be formally commenced
until the Democratic platform has been
adopted and the Democratic candidate is
nominated.
YOUNG RETTGER'S FUNERAL.
One of the Most Imposing Pageants Ever
Seen in Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Ohio. July 5. â The
funeral of William Rettger, the striker
killed at the Brown Hoisting Works, was
the most ' imposing funeral pageant ever
given a laboring man in Cleveland. There
has been but one occasion when there was
a larger procession and greater crowds â
the funeral of Garfield. To-day by actual
count 10,300 men formed the funeral cor
tege. The funeral services were Jield in
the church of the Immaculate Conception.
A conservative estimate places the num
ber of spectators about the church and
along the line of march to the cemetery at
100,000. The procession moved quietly
and save for the dirges played by the
many bands, no sound save the tread of
feet broke the quiet.
The troops are still under arms.

PIRATES INFEST
CATALINA ISLAND,
Not the Black Flag Kind,
Simply Non-Paying
Visitors.

Banning Men Patrol the Beach
to Prevent Tramp Yachts
From Landing.

AVALON, Catalina Island, July 5.â
For the past week reports have reached
the island almost daily that certain Long
Beach craft would again attempt to force
a landing at Avalon on July 4. Fore
warned is forearmed and so the company
quietly took steps to prevent these tramp
yachts from accomplishing their purpose
should they make the attempt. Constable
W. H. Cline has been here constantly on
the watch for pirate craft for a week and
on Friday was joined by fifteen deputies
from Los Angeles. These added to the
force of employes already on hand made a
company of about seventy men, who were
detailed to guard the beach. As there are
only about 1000 feet of beach where it is
possible to land a skiff, between Sugar
Loaf and the high bluff on the opposite
side of the bay, it will be seen that this
number of men could quite easily protect
the shore.
The trespassers, however, whether they
were cognizant of this force of men on
guard or not, evidently chose to effect a
landing under cover of darkness.
A carrier pigeon message was received
from San Pedro early in the day announc
ing that a Long Beach yacht had headed
for tue island at 8:30 a. m. Later in the
day another carrier pigeon, liberated in
midocean from the steamer Hermosa on
her return trip from the island to San
Pedro, arrived witti a message that two
yachts â the Moruing Star and Ranger â
one with a party of ten and tue other with
a party of sixteen on board, had been met
by the Hermosa ana were under full head
way for the island. Twilight was deepen
ing into darkness when the two yachts ap
proached the island. Each lingered just
outside Avalon Bay for some time and
then a string of new boats were seen to
glide out from the shore manned, it was
afterward learned, by friends of the pi
rates, who were evidently in connivance
with them, and the Morning St;ir was
towed in the bay, where she cast anchor,
the Ranger remaining outside taking ob
servations.
Constable Cline and bis deputies, rein
forced by others in authority and a throng
of 3000 onlookers, gathered on the beach,
and the excitement became intense. A
rowboat shot shoreward from the Morning
Star. In it was the captain, J. T. Nevins,
and E. B. Fuller of Los Angeles, one of
the passengers. The captain asked to be
allowed to come ashore and get some pro
visions. A permit from the company was
written out and given him. Mr. Fuller
bought a ticket from the Wilmington
Transportation Company, pungling up
$2 25 therefor, and was also permitted to
land.
Under the advantage of darkness and
with the connivance of friends on shore
two women afterward succeeded in land
ing. They were promptly spotted by the
alert deputies and put under the watchful
eys of the authorities.
8o long as they remained on the public
highway they were unmolested, but later
in the evening the women undertook to
enter the pavilion, private property of the
Banning Company, to participate in the
dancing, and were promptly met at the
door by an officer of the company, who re
quested them to present their transporta
tion tickets before entering. This, of
course, they were unable to do, and were
therefore left in outer darkness.
The party on the Morning Star included
Mr. and Mrs. E. P. Fuller, Mr. and Mrs.
Julius Pease, Mr. and Mrs. U. R. Bowers,
the Misses Maxwell, all of Los Angeles;
Charles Anderson, deputy postoffice in
spector, and a man from San Francisco
whose name was resolutely withheld.
Mr. Fuller, when asked if transportation
fees were paid the captain of the yacht,
hesitated slightly and then replied: "We
are guests ot Captain Nevins."
Later it was learned that this was only
a ruse, as it was understood that a col
lection for the captain was to be taken up
on the return trip. Mr. Fuller's propo*
sition that they were guests and not paid
passengers, however, is overthrown by his
own action in paying the transportation
fee to the Wilmington Transportation
Company, for if they were merely a
pleasure party they would not fall under
the ban ot trespassers, as the point at
issue with the W T ilmington Transportation
Compauy is the competition in paid traffic
from outside parties.
All pleasure crait is warmly welcome
and such parties are extended the privi
leges of the island free of charge.
The beach was patrolled by officers all
night. So far as learned none of the
Rancer's passengers attempted to come
ashore and this morning both yachts re
turned to the main land. The presence of

AUSTRALIA'S AFFLICTIONS.
Klightitiff Effect of the Coal Strike and
the Cattle Tick.
VANCOUVER, B. C, July 5. â The
steamer Miowera brings mail advices to
June 10 from Australia, which state that
the big coal strike at Newcastle is still on.
The miners will not give in, though their
families are in a starving condition. The
difference between the owners and col
liers is sixpence per ton in hewing rates.
Dr. Hunt, Australia s famous scientist,
is on his way to America to consult with
Dr. Salmon, the eminent United States
specialist, as to the means of extermi
nating the tick pest in Australia. The
tick is now destioying entire herds of
cattle all over Australasia and is ten times
worse than the terrible rabit plague of re
cent years.

J-'irf Kiiildi'io* Burned at Taeotna.
TACOMA, Wash., July S.â A fire in the
rear of Webster's black3mitn-shop, 2151
Jefferson avenue, last night, destroyed
hve frame buildings between 2149 and 2155
Jefferson avenue. The water pressure was
low, and for a time the department made
little headway. One was a three- story and
the others four two-story buildings. The
structures were a mass of flames when the
department arrived. All the buildings
but the blacksmith-shop were vacant. The
origin of the fire was unknown. Loss,
$7000; insurance small.
FIRE AT PORTERVILLE.
Seven Bui/dings in the Business Section

stroyed.
PORTERVILLE, Cal.. July 5â A fire
broke out at 2:15 o'clock this morning in
the rear end of a building on Main street,
known as Chiuda's fruit exchange. Seven
buildings were destroyed before it could
be checked. The fire had made good head
way before it was discovered and the
wooden structures burned ranidly.
Several members of the Fire Depart
ment had gone to Bakersfield, being con
testants in the hose races there yesterday,
but citizens took hold and rendered all the
aid possible.
The losses were : Wilko Mentz, general
merchandise, on stock and building $8000,

SANTACRUZ SALMON RUN
Schools of Big Fellows That Test
the Muscle of the
Angler.
Weigh From Forty to Fifty Pounds
and Game Enough for Any
Sportsman
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., July s.â The sum
mer run of salmon is on, with good signs,
as the fishermen say, for a big one. The
fish themselves are big ones. In fact they
are too big for the commercial advantage
of the men who follow fishing for a living.
More than 100 salmon were taeen to-day
by less than a dozen boats and many of
them weighed close to fifty pounds each,
while the small ones run from eight to
ten pounds each.
The Fish Commissioners, who were
here during the Dig run in February, said
there would be another big run in June.
They were not far amiss. The salmon
were here, but the fishermen didn't care
anything about them. The c arnival vis
itors, who saw the Philadelphia and the
Monadnock, furnished easier revenue for
the fishing craft, and the firshermen knew
the salmon would wait. They knew, too,
that the sardines were coming closer in
and that the salmon would follow them.
Just after the warships were gone the
fishing-boats were obliged to sail several
miles seaward to make a catch that was
worth while, but tney were coming closer
every day, uptil they are now operating
in the old fishing "ground," within two
and a half miles of the wharf.
The catch of to-day was all taken within
that distance, and a major portion of them
within a mile and a halt. There are tons
and tons of sardines close in, so that there
is no scarcity of bait But the fishermen
are disturbed over the size of the fish.
Those big fellows that weigh forty or fifty
pounds are game enough, and the sports
men may have fun enough with them, but
they break the fishermen's rigging and
thus make their taking expensive, while
many of tnem get away. To-morrow they
will be prepared for them with bigger
hooks and stronger rigging.
The prize salmon caught by Dr. Drullard
and Captain West yesterday proved bigger
than they had guessed. The fish was put
on a scale and it marked' 56% ponnds, and
was the biggest salmon taken this year.
The sportsmen are now after the big* rish
for the pride of being counted the heaviest
hook.
FRASER RIVER RAMPANT.
Great Damage to Crops From the Overflow.
Settlers Are Moving to Higher
Ground.
VANCOUVER, B. C, July s.â Reports
from Fraser River districts say that the
river is steadily rising. At Chilliwack
considerable damage has been done
to crops on the outlying lands
and the steamer Gladys has been
busily engaged for the past few days in re
moving cattle and settlers' effects to
higher ground. Nicomen Island is also
suffering from high water, and all down
the river on both sides, wherever low levels
are not fully protected by high dykes,
much damage is being done.
Mission City townsite will probably be
under water in many parts if the high
water continues. The opinion is ex
pressed that if the water does not recede
very soon the loss will be considerable.
Word has just been received from West
minster that the water at high tide was
2 feet 8 inches below the mark reached
during the floods of 1894.
The steamer Gladys brines word that
Pumas is flooded and the water is up to
the banks at Chilliwack. At Langley the
water is level with the landing and at sev
eral other places it is over the wharves.
PIONEER'S FUNERAL.
Cmsar Piatti Is Ruried by the Italian
Benevolent Society.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July s.â The funeral of
Caesar Piatti, a prominent member of the
Italian colony in this city, was held this
afternoon from the hall of the Italian
Benevolent Society, of which organization
the deceased was a member. The funeral,
which was conducted by the society, was
largely attended.
Mr. Piatti came to California in 1850
and a few years later located in this
county. For a number of years he was
engaged in the commission business in
this city. He was a native of Milan,
Italy, and 70 years of age. A wife and
daughter survive him.
A Cftinenf Host Succumb* to Opium.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July s.â Wong Ah,
the boss of a gang of Chinese berry-pickers
on the Cropley ranch near Mil pitas, was
found in an unconscious condition in his
bunjc yesterday morning and died shortly
afterward. He was addicted to opium and
Jin inquest showed that death resulted
from an excessive use of the drug. Six
opium pipes, half a pound of opium and
$70 were lound in his cabin. His body was
shipped to San Francisco for interment.
ma Can His Own Garden Truck.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July s.â John R. Pyle,
who is largely engaged in vegetable gar
dening on the King road, about three
miles east of this city, has erected a can
nery on his place and will can most of his
garden products. He experimented by
canning some beans last year, and met
with such success that this year he will
can peas, beans, tomatoes and other vege
tables. The cannery will give employ
ment to a number of hands.

HOPING AGAINST HOPE.
Distinct Rappings Heard on the
Rails by Twin Shaft
Rescuers.
Bare Possibility That Some of the
Entombed Miners May Tet
Be Living.
WILKESBARRE, Pa.. July s.â There
is a bare possibility that some of the men
entombed in the Twin Shaft at Pittston
may be taken out alive. The rescuing
party which was at work from 10 o'clock
last night until 4 o'clock this morning on
coming to the surface reported to Mine
Foreman O'Brien that they bad heard
rapping on the rails of the ean;?way road,
which may have been caused by some of
the entombed men. The rappings were
clear and distinct, as though some one had
struck the rail with a hard substance. The
supposed signal was answered by the res
cuers in the same manner. After a short
silence the answer came back, clear and
distinct.
At 7 o'clock to-night the rescuers say
they are witbm 400 feet of the entombed
men. The shifts have been increased
from twenty to thirty-five, who are re
lieved every half hour. They are still
cutting through the rock and progressing
more rapidly than at any time heretofore
since the work commenced.
Through the orders of General Superin
tendent Law. several skillful men were
quietly sent into the shaft this afternoon
to verify, if possible, the hopeful story of
the rappings. After prolonged efforts and
the use of every method of signaling pos
sible they came back to-night with a re
port of failure, not the least bit of noise
indicating that their labor in this direction
had been successful.
The work of the three mine inspectors
to investigate the disaster will begin to
morrow morning.
BELGIAN ELECTIONS.
Triangular Contests for Seats in the

caused by the withdrawal under the con-
stitution of one-half of the members of
the house, whose terms of office had ex
pired. Ihe final results are as yet un

hand. The figures received show that in
eighteen districts in Brussels and eleven
in Antwerp re-ballots will be required,
owing to triangular contests between Lib*

BARBECUE DAY
AT MONTEREY,
A Multitude Feasts at an
Old-Fashioned Mex
ican Picnic.
A PICTURESQUE SCENE.
Gayly Dressed Senoritas Mingle
With the Soldiers and
Marines.
SAVORY ODORS FILL THE WOODS
Five Thousand People Feed While
Mirth and Music Float Through
the Air.
MONTEREY, Cat.., July s.â The second
day of the celebration of Monterey's cen
tennial has been a most interesting one.
There was nothing on the programme un
til after churcn hours, but noon found
nearly all of the population of the quaint
old town in the pineÃ back of the Govern
ment reservation taking part in a real old
fashioned Mexican picnic.
The principal feature of the picnic was
the barbecue, and a most successful one
it proved. For this part of the entertain
ment expert cooks had been brought from
a distance and at midnight last night had
begun their preparations for the banquet.
r The trenches had been dug beforehand,
but the cooks built fires iv them of se
lected wood. As one load of fuel burnsd
down another was piled on, until by 10
o'clock this morning each trench was
filled with a bed of live coals that emitted
heat, but no smoke.
By 11 o'clock the picknicker3 began to
arrive. Tbe meat was piled onto a wire
crating laid over the fire. As the meat be
gau to cook the fragrant pine forest was
iilJed with savory odors and a pale blue
smoke ascended heavenward. Under some
of the largest trees long tables had been
built and provided wiih plates for many
thousands of people. Everybody helped
themselves and took their favorite cuts of
tender meat.
When the feast was at its height it
formed a pretty picture. The bright
dresses of the senoritas and the uniforms
of the boys in blue moving gently in the
sunlight, and thrown into strong relief
against the dark shadows of the pines, was
a scene to delight an artist The feast con
sumed several hours, and during t bat time
nearly 5000 people were fed. There was
music and dancing and the woods rang
with laughter, and not until the evening
shadows fell did the merry-makers leave
the scene.
At one time some of the masculine
feasters became hilarious and threw fruit
and meat at one another. They were not
very bad natured, however, and no great
damage was done.
Tne men-of-war shared tne honors to
day with otber points of interest and at
tracted thousands from the barbecue.
Large delegations came to town from
Salinas, Hollister, Pacific Grove and the
whole surrounding country, swelling tne
crowds on tha streets to unprecedented
proportions. Bicycle clubs mingled with
uniformed fire companies of different
â towns, and the visitors were all resplen
dent with distinctive badges. Every one
on the streets wore one or more jubilee
badges, while many carried tiny photo
graphs of Commodore Sloat, or souvenir
badges made of shells of Monterey and
enameled pictures of the Mexican Custom
house. These, with bows of tri-colored rib-
Jjon for personal decorations, and the lav-
ish profusion of bunting and National
flags, gave Monterey a brilliant gala ap
pearance.
But the bay was tempting; so were the
â white ships, and all day long strings of
boats plied between the wharf and the
men-of-war, carrying crowd after crowd
over the water.
Ex-Governor Paeheco met Jacob R.
Leese, and they talked over old times, so
Did that '49 is new in comparison. They
Bpoke about the first house in San Fran
cisco, built by Mr. Leese's father in 1837,
and of later days in Monterey, long before
the American flag was hoisted. A pioneer
of '49was in the group, and mentioned in
cidents now historical.
"JJut'that was so long after," remarked
Paeheco good naturedly, "that it is mod
ern, and I'm a pretty healthy boy yet."
In the afternoon there was a Yonng
Men's Christian Association meeting in
the pavilion. J. L. Speares, State secre
tary, and 11. J. McCoy, general secretary,
and others, spoke on association work. It
THE PICNIC UNDER THE PINES NEAR MONTEREY,
was an enthusiastic meetipg of some of the
best element in the local community.
There was a really enjoyable dance in
the pavilion at nicht. Large crowds at
â  tended and enjoyed the fun, and the sol
; diers and sailors were present in force and
1 danced with tne pretty girls of Monterey.

NOT ON THE PROGRAMME.
An Amateur Borer Succeeds in Getting
Vp a Real Battle.
MONTEREY, Cal., July 6.â Early this
morning when the sailors and soldiers
were over- jolly, a visitor from Pacific
Grove became entangled with one of the
bluejacuet9. One word followed another,
when presently tbe sailor reeled under a
blow. Jack was plucky and jumped up
like a flash at his enemy. He got tbe best
of the fight, at which the citizen's friends
took a band in the row. There happened
to be about 200 or 800 of Uncle' Sam's
men or\ the ground, and immediately they
banded themselves together and drove
back the attacking party. Numbers in
creased in tbe opposition so that the citi
| zens baa a strong mob, but the sailors
I knew their business and with the soldiers
they won a battle which was not on the
: hill. Some cut heads and bruised faces
j were the result, as the arms' an d navy was
â  overpowering and did not wish to carry
j the fight farther than a comparatively
peaceful victory.
The figbt was brought about by an
{ amateur boxer boasting he could "do"
â¢ any Sharkey the sailors had on board
' their ships. It started in a saloon on Al
varado street and Â«rorked out into tbe
street. By this time the mob had grown
i to very large proportions and met the
blue jackets face to face.
It was then after midnight and only
rioters and carnival celebrators were out of
doors. Still they formed a pretty strong
regiment and both sides fought with de
termination. Almost from the beginning
the sailors and soldiers had the mastery
and slowly they forced the mob backward,
fighting every inch of the way with their
lists. It was such a manly display that
the officers said, "Let them fight it out."
So the battle continued until the mob
bad been driven backward about a block
over what afterward proved to be a bloody
street. The chief special policeman was
twirled about like a baton in the hands of
a drum-major, and his best suit of clothe?
was ruined. The officers could only look
on until the battle was over.
FETERANS AT TENTURA.

VENTURA. Cal.. July s.â Memorial
Sunday was strictly observed at Camp
Phil-Sheridan, Key. Will Knighton, chap
lain of the association, preaching the me
morial sermon.
The services were more than ordinarily
impressive, a marked feature of special in
terest being the reading of tbe roll of
honor composed of those members of the
association who answered the last muster
call since the encampment of 1895. As
each name was called the drummer beat
three taps on & muffled drum : when the
last name was reached the bugle sounded
taps and the vacant chairs were decorated
with floral wreaths by members of the Sons
of Veterans ana the Ladies' Aid Society.
The music furnished by the Pomona
Quartet and Veterans' Fife and Drum
Corp3, made up of original selections, was
especially interesting and added to the
impressiveness of the ceremonies, which
were largely attended by citizens end vet
erans.

YALE'S CREW AT HENLEY
i Taking a Rest Before the Great
Trial Contest To-
Morrow.
Odds of Three to Two Against the
Americans Winning Are
Sought For.
HENLEY-ON-THAMES, Enq., July 5.â
The weather to-day was clear and very
warm, but so far as known the heat has
bad no appreciable effect on the members
of the Yale crew, who are all well.
No woik was done by the Americans
to-uay. all the men resting after their
week's practice, and nothing unusual oc
curring they will go to the starting line as
fit as any crew who start in tbe race for
tbe Grand Challenge cup, in tbe first trial
heat of which on Tuesday the Leander
and Yale crews will contest against each
other.
There has been no betting of note on
the event. Some Yale men are willing to
take odds of 3 to 2 against the Americans
winning.
The preliminary work of the crew has
been practically finished, and the men say
that to-morrow they will only do a little
light work to keep themselves in shape for
tbe strain of Tuesday.
Many visitors arrived to-day, and the
usual fashionable Henley crowd will be
present to witness the racing.

FEKRV3 FOUL MISFORTUNES.
A Good Baseball Game Bofore a Gooi
Crowd at the Folsom-Street
Grounds.
There was a rattling good game of ball
at the Folsom-street grounds yesterday
afternoon, despite, the fact that the score
was very one-sided. Both teams put up
an extra fine fielding game, but the Oak
lands easily outbatted the San Joses. The
latter is about a3 light-weight an organi
zation as has been seen here for a long
time. With the addition of a trio of heavy
hitters they would, however, compare
favorably with any team in the league.
Steffiani, the Garden City twirler, has
excellent control of the ball and is a fairly
good pitcher, but as a fielder- he is not up
to much. As a batter he is a rank failure.
Out of four chances at bat he struck out
three times. G. Foley, the San Jose third
baseman, tied Stefflam's poor record.
Doyle's excellent pitching had much to
do with the poor stick work of the South-,
erners, but it is doubtful if they could
have beaten the Oaklands, no matter how
hard they hit, .for Umpire Donahue was
manifestly prejudiced against them.
Donahue is a poor umpire, if his work of
yesterday is a fair sample. His judgment
as to balls and strikes was particularly
bad. Then he called McCarthy safe at the
plate in the last inning when that player
did not come within three feet of touch
ing the rubber.
Oakland was first at bat, and at once be
gan the run-getting. After Zann had been
retired, Ilanley hit safely, went to third
on a wild pitch and scored on Scott's long
fly to center. -VBlockers" tallied another
in the third on his second single, a stolen
base and Scott's safe drive to right. *Â ;
In the fifth, hits by Doyle, Hanley, Til
son and Leonard, aided by the San Jose's
only error, resulted in making Oakland's
total five.
The Garden City men gained their only
runs in the seventh. Robinson led- off
with a hit to left field. Ferry flew out.
Graham his base on balls and Foley
forced, him at .second, which base Foley
subsequently stole. Percisa scored both
Robinson and Graham by hitting safely to
left field. Steffiani retired the side by
striking out.
Tuere was no more run getting until the
ninth inning, although in the eighth San
i Jose was robbed of a run by Ferry's over
anxiety. Ferry was. first at bat in this
inning and sent three long fouls along the
third baseline, any one. of which, it fair,
would have been a .two-bagger. â '; In one
instance he was particularly unfortunate,
for the wind carried the ball quite a dis
tance and landed it only a few inches out
side the line. Ferry finally sent a slow
grounder to third. Brown fumbled it and
Ferry tried to make second on . the play,
but was thrown out. Graham, the next
man up, sent a -long fly into middle
garden on which he easily got two bases
and' on which Ferry, could have readily
scored from first. . >.
; In the last inning the Oaklands warmed
to their work, and, aided by Donahue's
poor decision, piled up six runs.' Hanley
got a base on bulls after Zann had fanned
out Scott followed with a double," scoring
Hanley. Brown struck out. Tilson and
Leonard then hit. safely and Scott came
home. Delmas took first for being hit by
a pitched ball. McCarthy waited for four
bad ones and the bases were tilled. ;. Doyle
and Zann singled, Tilson, Leonard, Del
mas ana McCarthy scoring. Leonard
should have been called out at the plate,
which would have retired the side with
four runs.' Hanley ended the agony by a
fly to left field. /
The San Joses went out in order in their
half of the final inning. Score:

A PRETTY CONTEST.
The Imperials Defeated the Pacifies
at Presidio Athletic Park.
About 600 people witnessed a pretty con
test at Presidio Athletic Park yesterday,
in whicn the Imperials defeated the Paci
fies by a score of 9 to 7.
Pitcher McCarthy was on hand to offi
ciate in tbe box for the PaciGcs, but Kelly
of the Imperials regained his old form and
held down his opponents in great style.
Not a run was scored on either side until
the third inning, when the Imperial?
bunched four hits and got three men
around. The Pacifies, however, got two
runs in their hall of the third, added two
more in the fourth, and apparently
clinched the game by culling an addi
tional three in the sixth.
Tbe Imperials, however, then got on
their mettle and piled up five tallies in the
seventh and eighth. To put a clincher on
the game they added another in the final
inning.
Kelly and McCarthy fielded their posi
tions excellently, and Monahan made the
star play of the game in the fifth, when he
captured a high liner from Kelly's bat.
McDermott made a great one-hand catch
in the seventh. Bcore :

OPERA SUNG IN ITALIAN,
"Crispino c la Comare" Is
Given at tbe Standard
Theater.
A Work in Which Several Local
Performers Distinguished Them
selves.
A well-known Italian opera, "Crlspino
ela Coraare," was rendered last night at
the Standard Theater by a company of local
Italian performers, headed by G. Panizza.
There was a good audience present and
tbe singers were greeted with frequent ap
plause.
The opera is one of the old school, with
plenty of melody, and, like all the old
operas, it gives the performers plenty of
opportunities for displaying vocal agility.
Mrs. Flora Peterman, the prima donna,
was a stranger to most of tbe audience,
and it was very evident from her acting
that siie was unused to appearing on the
stage, but the way in which she took ad
vantage of her vocal opportunities won
her the warmest applause. She has a
sweet, flexible voice of the soprano-leg
giero order^which. in its flute-like quality,
recalls Emma Nevada's. Mrs. Peterman
has not at present the training and expe
rience of a prima donna, but she showed
last night that the possibilities are there,
and when she shook off her nervousness
and lost some of her tremolo her singing
nai very charming.
G. Panizza, the Crispino of the cast, is
well known here as an excellent artist.
Last night he was the mainstay of tbe
whole performance. He sang and acted
his own part with all the verve and finish
of the experienced opera singer that he is.
He also appeared to know everyone else's
role as well as his own, for when a ner
voua amateur hesitated for want of a word
or a musical phrase Panizza always came
to the rescue before he was lost, and in one
or two cases he took up a lost thread of
dialogue with such ready wit that the
bouse laughed and applauded.
The story of "Crispino c la Comare"
tells bow a poor Venetian cobbler was
befriended by a sort of fairy godmother.
With her assistance he was enabled to pose
most successfully as a great doctor, for
whenever the patient was going to die the
fairy godmother appeared, and when she
stayed away Crispino could safely predict
recovery. After subduine the opposition
of tne learned doctors, whose diagnoses he
proved to be wrong, Crispino finally fell
from his successful position through his
wife, who grew jealous of the fair}*, and for
the sake of domestic peace be foreswore
the "Comare" and returned to his cob
bler's bench.
As Fabrizio, a despotic doctor, who
finally bowed to Crispmo's wisdom, G.
Almagia sang and acted excellently. He
was one of the performers who was per
fectly at ease on the stage and who made
the most of his part. G. Bertino did good
work as a Tuscan nobleman and the other
parts were satisfactorily taken by G. Di-
Grazia, A. Grella, A. Biagi, F. Danieie and
Lilly Douglass.
The male chorus did vpry efficient work.
Among those comprising it were: G. Mac
cagno, A. Garbini, J. CaDrile, V. Franchi,
F. Danieie. G. Bianchi, G. Castiglioni, A.
Grella, A. D. Blua, A. Biagi, F. Frances
chini, M. Delia Valle, T. Mino, G. Vai.
Bignor G. Martinez contributed a good
deal to the success of tha performance by
his intelligent conducting.
GOOD SHOOTING
ACROSS THE BAY,
Close of the Tournafient
Shoot at Alameda
Point.
INCREASED ATTENDANCE
Six Open Matches in Which a
Great Many Contestants
Entered.
PROTEST IN THE CLUB SHOOT.
Although tbe Stocktons Tied the Re*
liance Team, They Received
No Money.
The attendance* at the second day's
shooting at the Pacific Tournament Asso
ciation opening shoot on their new
grounds at Alameda Point yesterday was
consideiably larger than on Saturday. The
shooting was good, the work of Clarence
Naumahn, who made such a good record
at Saturday's shoot, being especially good.
The only trouble during the day arose
over the division of money in the club
shoot. The Reliance Club and the Stock
ton Athletic Club teams tied at 121 points,
but a protest was made against awarding
half the money to the Stockton team on
the ground that the team was not com
posed of Stockton men, but had been
picked on the grounds yesterday. A meet
ing of the officers of the association had to
be called to settle the difficulty, which was
finally ended by the Stockton team with
drawing its entrance money and the event
being awarded to the Reliance Club, Lin
coln Club taking second money.
The events of yesterday's shoot were:
Event No. Iâlo birds, entrance 50 cents,
four moneys.
Event No. 2â15 birds, entrance 75 cents,
six moneys, $10 added.
Event No. 3â15 birds, entrance 75 cents,
six moneys. $10 added.
Event No. 4â20 birds, entrance SI. eight

Event No. 5â15 birds, entrance 75 cents,

M ARINES FOR PUGET NOUND
Important Visit of a Jfaval Officer to thÂ«
Coast.
SEATTLE, Wash.. July s.â Major
George C. Reid, U. S. N., Adjutant In
spector of tbe Marine Corps, arrived at
Seattle to-night via the Canadian Pacific
from Washington city.
Hia trip West is of a great deal of im
portance to the Pacific Coast, especially
Puget Sound. After making a hurried
visit to the Government marine sta
tion at Sitka, Alaska, for which
place he goes to-morrow on the
steamship Queen, Major Reid will return
here and make a formal inspection of the
Puget Sound naval station at Port Or
chard, where be will locate a garrison of
100 marines. This done the inspector
will proceed to San Francisco and make
bis annual inspection of the garrison at
Mare Island.
"I regard the Puget Sound naval station
as of great importance," Major Reid said
in discussing the question of coast de
fense, "as it is the only one on the Pacific
coast between San Francisco and SjtKa,
being also on the border of the British
possessions. It should really have 300 ma
rines from the very start.
"The question of the coast defenses,'
the Major continued, "is one of vital im
portance, and the Pacific Coast is fortunate
in having so able and earnest an advocate
of such matters as United States Senator
Squire at the head of tbe Committee on
Coast Defenses.
"The running appropriation, involving
nearly $80,000,000, part of which is now
available for coast-defense purposes, was
secured mainly through the efforts of Sen
ator Squire."
Major Reid said the Government is con
sidering the advisability of establishing
an army post in Alaska, possiDly on tba
Yukon. It i 3 the intention of the in
spector to have 100 marines, all of -whom
will be taken from Eastern stations,
transferred to the Puget Sound station as
soon as he returns East.
LOS ANGELES LEVANTER,
Fred Bennion, a Life Insurance
Man, Leaves for Lower Cali
fornia.
An Accomplished Wife and Many
Creditors Are Anxious as to His
Welfare.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July s.â Fred
Bennion, well known among life insurance
men of this city and San Francisco, has
found it convenient to fold his tent and
steal silently away to Lower California,
where friendly extradition lawa will never
more permit his creditors to molest or
make him afraid.
Bennion is an Englishman of speedy
habits"and an exceedingly oily tongue.
He has been known here for some months
as the "Lightning Life Insurance Agent."
H. E. Maxson of the Mutual Life says that
Fred could do as much business in one
week as the average canvasser could in six
months. But be has gone where insur
ance men trouble not the populace, and
several creditors are now wondering
"where he is at."
In addition to a popular tailoring firm
and an astute local hotel manager, one
bank is out of pocket about $300 for hav
ing honored one of Bennion's checks.
Bennion's first work on this coast was for
A. B. Forbes of the Mutual Life at San
Francisco, after which he was transferred
to this city and soon afterward "lit out"
for cause, but has since made good his de
linquency to Local Manager Maxson.
Then he engaged with the Equitable
Life, but with what results Manager
Shields declines to state. Mr. Shields
deprecates any publicity, saying:
"Fred may be below the line in Mexico,
bnt I think he means all right and will
pay up every cent in time. Yes, I know
the bank in question, but must decline to
name it."
Bennion leaves an accomplished wife
behind, now at Elsinore Hot Springs.

Saved From a Watery Grave.
ASTORIA, Oh., July s.â Simon Pakkila
and Erik Paso, who were supposed to
have been drowned on Thursday night or
Friday morning last, were brought in this
morning from tne lightship, where they
have been since Friday morning.
They had a narrow escape from death,
having clung to their upturned boat for
about twelve hours. Fortunately the cur
rent carried them near the lightship, the
crew of which put off and rescued them.

Talks About the Alleged
Sell-Out.
HISTORY OF THE ORDER.
In Less Than Ten Years Its
Membership Has Grown to

PLATFOKM FULLY EXPLOITED.
Pays Particular Attention to the
Organization and the Men Who
Compose It
"The A. P. A. Bold Out," was the sub
ject of an interesting lecture delivered by
Dr. George H. Derrick before the Good
Citizenship meeting at Metropolitan Tem
ple yesterday afternoon. The speaker
confined his remarks almost entirely to an
exhaustive interpretation of the principles
on which the American Protective Asso
ciation is founded. He was applauded
frequently, and at the conclusion of the
address tendered a perfect ovation.
"I am glad to meet you again," said Dr.
Derrick, "glad to be in such good com
pany. I did not think it possible for me
to be present when the chairman asked
rue to speaK. He said something about
the Monitor and being sold out at % of
a cent per pound. I then thought that I
would come and demand, if I had been
old out so cheap, that the goods be de
livered.
"The only question to-day is. Is the A.
P. A. right? I would rather stand alonÂ»
with the chairman and be on the side of
right than have Mechanics' Pavilion
crowded to the doors and know that I
spoke words of untruth and fallacy. If I
am to speak of the 'A. P. A. Sold Out' I
would define what is meant by A. P. A.
"We started less that ten years ago, the
growth being very slow at first. To-day
we have 2.000,000 voters, while the W. A.
P. A.'s have hundreds of thousands of
members ready to stand by their hus
bands. When you see such a movement
as this you may know that it is founded
on truth and justice.
"I wish you to understand the difference
between the organization and the men
who compose that organization. Take,
for instance, the composite picture of fifty
men â forty-nine with mustache and one
with full beard. In the composite crea
tion you see the fifty faces with full mus
tache, but only the faintest outline of a
beard. Now, this organization is not the
expression of one individual or of 10,000.
It is the composite formation of a princi
ple, and it is the principles of an institu
tion which must be sold out, if anything
can be. Individuals may do this ~scrt ot
tiling, but that does not upoil the institu
tion. If the A. P. A. was blotted out to
day circumstances would make another
because the conditions demand it. But
the A. P. A. will live â it has already taken
its place on the scroll of time.
"A few days ago a speaker, I need not
tell who he is, made use of the following
remarkable statement:
As to Irish bosses, ward-heelers, saloon
keepers and pugs, lam under the impression
that the vast majority of them will compare
favorably with the average Methodist preach
ers in this country. lam prepared to show by
statistics that none of the classes mentioned
furnish as large a proportion of criminals as do
the Methodist ministry of this country-
"Now I would like to know what figure
this sort of argument cuts in the subject
matter. If the principles are true and
heralded by the vilest of men, yet will
they live forever. The Catholic priest
hood may be pure or vile, but if their
principles are right they will live on. The
individual character may be true or false;
it is the principles of an institution which
must purify or purge.
"Now what are the principles of the
A. P. A.? Look at the first:
Loyalty to true Americanism, which knows
n. ither birthplace, race, creed nor party, is the
first requisite for membership.
"Colonial America had its Benedict
Arnold, but the principles only shone the
brignter wnea he had gone to the other
side.
"A few days ago there was a lecturer in
O.kland who said: 'We have the enemy
on the run. There goes Dille, Case and
pusillanimous Hudleson.' But suppose
they had gone â all of them â there would
cave been hundreds and thousands of
patriotic citizens to carry on the battle.
"Now take up section 3:
Wiiiie tolerant of all creeds, it holds that
subjection to and support of any ecclesiastical
power not created and controlled by American
citizens and which claims equal if not greater
sovereignty than the Government of the
Uuited States of America, is irreconcilable
with citizenship. It is therefore opposed to
the holding of offices in the National or mu
nicipal Government by any supporter of such,
ecclesiastical power.
"The reason this was adopted was be
cause Leo XIII said all Catholics must
make themselves felt in all public affairs
in the country where they happen to be;
all Catholics should endeavor to mold the
constitution on the principles of the only
true church. This was promulgated just
one year before the A. P. A. was organ
ized. When it came across the Atlantic,
it is no wonder that good men rose up and
said, 'Thus far shalt thou go and no far
tfter.*
"Now we come to section 5, which says:
We consider the non-sectarian free public
â school the bulwark ot American institution?!
and the best place for the education of Ameri
can children. To keep them such, we protest'
against the employmentof subjects of any un-
American ecclesiastical power as officers or
teachers of the public schools.
"There is an institution in this town op
l osii:g the new charter, and why? Be
cause it requires that all teachers employed
in the public schools shall oe educated in
p rue State institution. If you fail to vote
for that charter you will neglect your duty.
If you send a man to the Legislature make
him introduce a bill providing that all
teachers shall be educated in the gram
mar schools.
"No member of the Catholic church loses
place in her ranks or caste with her hier
archy for saying, as did Priest Phelan in a
set of resolutions presented at one of their
gatherings, that
The present system of public schools is a
curse to the country and a floodgate of athe
ism ana sensuality, and of civil, social and
Ka.ional corruption; and the children turn
out to be learued bone thieves, scholastic
counterfeiters and well posted on schemes of
deviltry.
"Nor have Archbishop Kain of St. Louis
or Monsignor Satolli dealt out discipline
to this same priest, who, speaking of the
great gathering of Christian Endeavorers,
said, among other equally shocking things :
The corrupting tendencies of such heteroge
neous gatherings of young people cannot be
overestimated, and for downright viciouaness
and depravity ttiey have never been equaled
since the horrid saturnalia ot Greece and
Rome.
The speaker then took up each of the re
maining plunks of the A. P. A. platform,
closing with the remark that the rumor of
"sell out, barter and sale" was founded
only in the imagination of those who hated
the principles on which the organization
was fouudei.
AMUSEMENTS FOR EVERYBODY
A Nnmber of Attractions That Are to Be
Offered at the Playhouses To-Nlgtat.
"Americans Abroad," by Victorien Sar
dou, is billed at the California Theater
for this evening. It is a comedy-drama in
which Effie Shannon will lake the leading
role and be supported by the Stockwell
company.
The charming comedy, "London Assur

Theater this evening by the Frawley com
pany. The cast is a strong one and the
stace settings will be very elaborate and
tne costumes new.
The management of the Tivoli Opera
house will, under the direction of Gustav
Hinricbs, produce "Lucia di Lammer
moor." Mme. Natili will appear in the
title role and Maurice de Vries is cast for
the role of Henry Ash ton.
At the Grand Opera-house Jules Walters,
a new leading man from from New York,
is to appear in "A Stolen Note," a play
that has been the rage in Boston and in
New York. He will be supported by the
full strength of the company.
There is a rare treat on at the Orpheum
Music Hall for this evening, for there are
a great many specialties to be offered to
the patrons. One of the features will be
the Jockiey-Boston troupe that has just
arrived from the East.
THE PORTLAND ATHLETES.
They Will Meet the Olympic
Boys in This City Next
September.
Tom Sharkey Will Box in the Acme

belt's Condition.
Leonard Gill, captain of the Olympic
Club, states that a return field day will be
given to the Multnomah Athletic Club of
Portland, Oregon, in this City in Septem
ber next, and that the officers of the day
will be selected from clubs outside of the
Olympic.
Gill was very sorry to learn that Kerri
gan, the wonderful little high jumper of
Portland, was lying dangerously HI at bis
home, but he hopes to hear of the great
athlete's quick recovery.
The most disappointed member of the
Olympic team which invaded Portland
was Dave Brown of the Stanford Univer
sity.
Brown had heard from Walter Bcott, one
of the retired long distance runners of the
Olympic Club, that he would need be in
splendid form to defeat Tallant of the
Multnomah Club; but Brown had an idea
that there was not a man on the coast who
could exercise him, and he visited Port
land with a firm belief that he would de
feat Tallant and have yards to spare.
The unexpected happened on this oc
casion and Brown met his Waterloo. He
sti'.i thinks that he can show Tallant a
clean pair of heels from the start to the
finish of a mile race, and according to the
following letter he wrote Captain Gill from
Stanford, he is deeply anxious for a return
race:
BTANFORP University, July 3, 1896.
My Dear Leonard: Is there any possibility ol
getting a return meet with the Multnomah
team this fall in San Francisco? If so, I wisfa
you would inform me and I will try to be in
better shape to run "the old man." More speed
is what I need and J should do much better il
I train with this in view. From all I can heai
they are rather anxious to come and I was
wondering whether you would take any meas
ures to get them. September 15 is late enough.
Biucerely yours, D. E. Brown.
Brown calls Tallant an old man because
he is married and has a small family to
look after. Tallant is only 28 years of age
and as can be seen by a reference to the
records of past champions, the fastest
times that have ever been made in foot
racing were negotiated by athletes after
they had passed the thirty yesrs limit.
SpeaKing of the ages of athletes who had
accomplished wonderful performances be
tween the ages of 30 and 40 years, John
Elliott of the Olympic Club, who is the
standard authority of this coast on gen
eral athletics, said yesterday that he had
taken an exception to an article which
appeared in a morning paper of yesterday
written by W. W. Naughion in which it
was stated that an athlete is in bis prime
between the fifteenth and twenty-fifth
year of his life.
Elliott says that he cannot remember of
an athlete in any country who , accom
plished any performance worthy of note
at the age of 15 years, and that the best
performances were those of men between
30 and 35 years of age. Elliott also stated
that a pugilist should be in his prime
when 30 ?ears of age.
Tom Sharkey is 24 years old and Jim
Corbett 30 years. The former has an ex
cellent opportunity of cultivating clever
ness, but the latter will never regain lost
vitality, although he can repair to some
extent a partly wrecked constitution by
remaining aloof from the "good things"
of life, which to an athlete are ruinous.
A prominent physician and a friend of
Corbett's who had a good look at the
chamiuon before he faced Sharkey said
that Jim Is unquestionably on Vie retro
gradeâthat is, physically speakingâ and
under the most careful system of training
be never will be able to regain his old
form.
Sharkey terminated his engagement in
this City last evening and on Wednesday
evening he will box four rounds with
Danny Needham, his trainer, at the ex
hibition which will be given in Oakland
on Wednesday evening under the au
spices of the Acme Athletic Club.
On Friday next Sharkev will start with
a local theatricul troupe through the coup
tr7i giving sparring exhibitions. He will
visit Vallejo, Stockton, Sacramento and
may possibly journey as far northward as
Portland, Or. He says that in six months
from now he will be sufficiently clever to
hit Corbett, and that his blows will be
felt.
Some one jocosely remarked to Sharkey
last night that Corbett will scheme to close
Tom's peepers, and thus win the game on
a blind deal.
Tom smiled, and answered in his easy
aad smiling way that it took two men to
play a game of that kind, and that while
Corbett was trying to paint Sharkey's eyes
Sharkey might be engaged in knocking
some of the mineral out of Jim's kidneys.

MONTANA'S CHIEF
JUSTICE IN TOWN,
Judge Pemberton Pays Cali
fornia His First
Visit.
PROSPECTIVE GOVERNOR
In Montana for Thirty -Three
Years and Reflects Its
Life.
A DEMOCRAT AND A SILVEBITE
Discusses Honey Questions and Re*

Long- Haired M n.

of the Supreme Court of Montana and a
strong probability for gubernatorial hon-
Chief Justice Pcmberton of Montana: "I've never sjeii a long-haired fellow carrying a gun on
his hip who was not an infernal coward."
ors, is in the City on his first visit to Cali
fornia.
The Judge is a man past middle age, and
yet he has apparently lost little of the
eager spirit that must have characterized
him when he went to Montana thirty
three years ago and bung out his shingle
in a Territory where lawyers were not in
dispensable to thÂ« operation of justice.
His conversation, characterized by an easy
abandon, is full of suggestions of an expe
rience of many years in a country where
conventionalities have been forgotten in
expression of cordiality and hospitality.
Elected District Judge six years ago he
had served but two years when the Popu
lists and Democrats united in nominating
him by acclamation for Chief Justice. And
he was elected.
He was born in Nashville, Term., and
upon graduating from the Lebanon Law
Bchool in 1861 was admitted to the bar.
Two years afterward he began practice in
the wild new Territory of Montana.
When seen yesterday at the Grand in
company with his friend, ex-United States
Marshal Stuart F. Loughborough of New
Mexico, Judge Pemberton was very re
luctant about talking politics, bat after a
little hesitation he said:
"We regard the silver question in Mon
tana as a business question. Financial
conditions show tnat tnere is only enough
gold in the world to pay the interest on
the world's debt for less tnan one year.
No man could do business in any part of
the civilized world if he did not have capi
tal enough to pay the interest on his in
debtedness for one year. Governments
are simply aggregations of individuals,
and in the management of their business
affairs they must be controlled by the
same rules that govern individuals; and if
governments have not money enough to
pay the interest on their debts for the
space of one year they cunnot hope to
transact business with the idea that pros
perity can come to the people from the
administration of Government affairs.
"The individual transacts bis business
upon the theory that it will result in pros
perity to himself. Governments must
transact, their governmental affairs upon
the theory that prosperity must com? to
the masses of the people, unless we aban
don the idea of Mr. Lincoln that this is a
Government of the people, by the people
and for the people.
"I regard the financial question not as
a partisan question, but as a question of
patriotism of so much importance as to
require every man to tnke a stand in favor
of the masses against plutocracism and
Sbylockisrn.
"The Republican convention that met
in St. Louis had as delegates the two Sen
ators from the State of Montana, Hon. Lea
Mantle and Hon. Thomas H. Carter, and
Charles 8. Hartman, the Representative
in Congress. Hartman bolted with the
Teller contingent. The people of Mon
tana, since Hartman returned, commended
his action by numerous ovations and pub
lic receptions."
Then tne Judge turned the conversation
to less weighty subjects, and with the
change the dignity of the Chief Justice
was forgotten in the enthusiasm and jovi
ality of the raconteur of life as he had
known it in the early days of the Terri
tory, when to declare that you were in
favor of law and order occasioned threat
ening manifestations from the desperado
elf men t.
"I like San Francisco for its fruits and
its flowers and its fragrance, but for busi
ness there is uo place like Montana," re
marked the Chief Justice with genuine
pride in his State. "A man going to
Butte has to wait a month for a vacant
house if he wants one. Butte is the best
copper camp on this earth. It pays out
more money to laborers in proportion to
population than any other town on this
earth, and hospitable â just ask the people
that have been there.
"I have had a good many dealings with
desperadoes in the thirty-three years 1
have been in Montana, but i never saw
one that would kill when you got tbe first
draw on him. And these bad men, well,
I've never seen a long-haired fellow with
a gun on his hip who wasn't an infernal
coward." ______________

A THREAT TO SHOOT
Mrs. Manning Says She May Put
a Bullet in the Motor
man's Heart.
CORONER'S IK QUEST TO-DAT.
James Manning Is in the Employ of
the Company, But a Damage
Suit May Result
The mangled and torn little body of
eight-year-old Walton Manning, who was
so cruelly killed by trolley-car 1004 of
the Mission-street line about 8 o'clock on
the evening of the Fourth, was taken out
to his home late yesterday afternoon from
the Morgue.
Tears from his parents' eyes fell like
drops of rain on the little bier. They
grieved with bowed heads and faces con
cealed in their hands. But the younger
brothers and sisters, yet too young to fully
understand how cold and cruel is the
clutch of death sometimes on the hearts
of the living, felt the touch of grief. Then
came the most affecting touch of pathos on
the scene. The baby grief broke forth.
They gazed at first in wonderment on the
little dead face of their brother and then
burst into tears of pure sympathy from
seeing their mamma and papa weep.
Cruel the wheels of the trolley-car, but
surely not so cruel as this !
To-day the remains will be returned to
the Morgue so that the Coroner's jury may
see them on proceeding with the inquest.
The funeral may not take place till to
morrow.
Mrs. Manning, who swooned on the
sidewalk and had to be carried upstairs to
her bed, was a htt'e better yesterday and
able to be around some. She kissed and
embraced her other children convulsively
whenever they came near her. Mrs. Man
ning is in a condition of delicate health,
and last night her husband had to sum
mon a , physician for her. He remained
with her a good part of the night. Mr.
and Mrs. James YV. Manning live at 2614
Mission street. As well as humble, theirs
was a very sad home yesterday.
There are two windows in the front
room, and it was at these windows they
were sitting when the life of the boy was
crushed out before their eyea.
Walton had just been sent on an errand
to a grocery-store over on the corner of
Twenty-fourth street. He left his broth
ers anÂ«l some other children playing with
firecrackers on the sidewalk in front of the
door. He was walking diagonally across
the street. The outbound trolley-car
slipped noiselessly and swiftly toward him
from bohind. Just as he stepped on the
track the little fellow turned, smiled and
waved a little band at his playmates. And
then
The car struck him. He was under the
wheels. The remor^e'ess and unfeeling
wheels tore and mangled him and his
life's blood flowed out on the white stones
as he was dragged along.
Ladies on the car and poople in the
street screamed and waved tneir bands.
The motorman, it is said, was not looK>
ing ahead. He was looking over on the
other siae of the street, where other chil
dren were shooting firecrackers. When
his attention wad finally secured he
stopped tne moving juggernaut. It
was too late then. There was hardly
enough left of t:.e little body, whose spirit
was so hapny a moment before over his
Fourth of July, to put decently into the
dead wagon of the Morgue. The huge car
had to bo run over the body in order to
extricate it. The father stood by with
pale face and his heart trying to leap from
his throat. The mother had swooned.
The passengers and spectators sickened at
the sight.
Mr. Manning said yesterday afternoon :
"The motorman had another man in the
box with him. Both were looking across
the street, and he did not ring the bell.
If he had rung tbe bell Walton would
be alive to-day. I saw from the window
the car moving down upon him. My
heart stood still.
"I pounded on the window pane and
shouted to the motorman, but it was no
use. He did not or could not hear me. I
saw he was going to be struck, and I made
a leap for the stairs. I don't know how I
got down. But it was too late to save my
boy. He had been struck, and when I got
to the door was beinjr drazeed along the
track. The inotorman was alone to blame.
He was my eldest son and a bright, good
little fellow. He was ol much help to his
mother."
When asked if he intends to brine: suit
against the company for damages Mr.
Manning said :
"I am in the employ of the company as
a lineman. Ido not know what I shall do
yet. I cannot afford to lose my job. But
I shall do something. I may see to-mor
row what I can do about it.''
Yesterday Mr. Manning was inclined to
take the accident as calmly and philo
sophically as possible.
But it is different with Mrs. Manning.
She is almost hysterical in her denuncia
tion of the killing.
"Ob, my poor Wally, my poor boy!"
she exclaimed. "He was such a comfort,
help and companion to me. I leaped with
my husband down the stair*, but he was
dead then. I hope he did not feel the
wheels and the crushing.
"But somebody shall pay for this," she
declared with defiance. "I'll put a bullet
through Be^ley's heart or the company
shall pay me. That's what I shall do. But
money will not pay me for my boy â no,
no, no! I shall be revenged for his death.
I shall have satisfaction. I would throw
the money into the street. I would give
it all for my boy."
The poor woman covered her face with
her apron and wept as though all the
strir.po of her heart had snapped. Her
husband put his arm around her shoulders
and tried to comfor. her.
Just then a white pointer dog trotted
out into the street and smelled of the
stone stained with blood. Mrs. Manning
saw it. It was horrible.
"See!" she said. "He killed him as
he would a dog â crushed him as he
would the meanest cur! O, I shall go
mad, mad! But he will never kill another
boy. I would put a bullet in his heart!'
The green cars of the Mission-street line,
and No. 1004 isasrreen car, have fenders on
both ends with a shelf. The shelf runs
three to four inches above the pavement.
So little a fellow as Walton Manning, es
pecially if be fell with feet loward the car,
would not be protected by the iender, but
would be squeezed and crushed. And this
is what it did to him.
Car No. ICO4 was on its usual run yester
day. But Motorman Thoiley iJegley
luid off. Th â¢â¢ remorseless wheels rolled
over the tracks and the pinions yowled
their same old song as thouph nothing hud
happened aud as though the feuder was
there to save human li!e.
In one ot his humorous books Mark
Twain humorously tells of the language of
the wneeis of the railroad coach. But in
this instance of the.'trolley-car in the City
the interpretation is different. As ihe
trucks of car No. 1004 rolled over the rail
joints yesterday they seem to *chime out:
"Iâ killedâ biraâ lâ killedâ himâ l-killed
â him â I â killed â him â here!"

Marie Walsh Explains Pro

Work, "Etidorpha."
Abbott Clark Lectures on tbe Great
Theosophical Cru-ade and the
Mahatmas.
Miss Marie Walsh, before the Inter
national TheoÂ«opuical Society at Native
Sons' Hall last evening, spoke on the book
"Etidorpha," written by Professor Lloyd
of Cincinnati, which is creating such a
great sensation among literary circles of
the East, and which has already reached
its sixth addition.
She followed the chief character men
tioned In the book into the cave and
thence to the region of lisrht and obsolute
peace, and explained the meaning of the
allegory as intended to descrirje the j
journey of a person from the circum
ference to the center of his beine, through
bis knowledge and selfishness into the
soul.
She explained how the writer showed
the differentiation of the senses to be in
reality but different aspects of the same
sense, and this made clear the deep mean
ing conveyed t>y the creatures the chief
character of the book meeta with in his
career.
Etidorpha spelled backward reads
"Aphrodite," the goddess of love of the
Greeks, and symbolic of eterLal harmony,
of tbe balance of the sexes, and of an evo
lution that knows neitner hindrance nor
cessation.
At tbe San Francisco Theosophical So
ciety, on Post street, Abbott Clark of Los
Aneeles. formerly of Sa;; Francisco, spoke
on "The Theosophical Crusade and the
Mahatmas."
He began his address by explaining that
mahatmas are perfected" men â men who
possess great souls and have reached the
highest plane of human development or
Christhood.
These men are the leaders of all the
great historical events of the human fam
ily. Buddha was a mahatma; also Christ
and Confucius and Zoroaster of the Per
sians. The last manatma was Biu
vatsky. After Mme. Blavatsky came
Judge. Mrs. Tinpley is considered as an
adept, or in the intermediate stage of per
fection between a man and a mahatmn.
Mr. Clark explained that the present
crusade, which is now in operation in
England, is a movement to enlighten all
classes and nations on the great truths of
theosophy.
Among its leaders are A. V. Hargrove,
president of the Theosophical Society,
Mrs. K. A. Tingley and many other's.
This party of theosophists will visit
nearly every country in" the world, speak
ing in all the principal cities, where they
will hire the largest halls obtainable.
This crusade comes on the crest of a
cycle wave culminated by many cycles of
spiritual and physical importance. It is
an unusual time in the world's history and
great things may be expected. Truths
will be given to the classes that before
were debarred on account of poverty and
lack of education. Truth will be given in
such a form that it may be assimilated by
all men. The natural evolution of
humanity has made this possible. The
crusaders will terminate their wanderings
in this country, coming to San Francisco
by the way of China and Japan.

FOR PRESII>ENT-
WILLIAM HcKINLET, of Ohio
FOR TICK-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EtKCTION NOVEMBER 8. 1896.
All aboard for Monterey.
At Chicago everything seems to be over
but the bust up.
The chief objection to Silver Dick Bland
is that he is a chromo.
What a surprise party this convention
roust be to Tammany Hall.
The McKinley button fits every Ameri
can coat as if it were made for it.
We do not need more money ao much
as more circulation of the money we have.
Calline free silver "Populism" will not
catch Populist votes for a mossback Demo
crat.
Some men are born great, some achieve
greatness and others are mentioned at
Chicago.
Pn far as California is. concerned, pro
tection is not only the niain issue but the
only issue.
While the heated East talks politics,
Californin recreates herself with a festival
of patriotism.
Every Republican club helps to restore
the era of good work and good wages ior
American labor.
Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I his
Cromwell and Mr. Cleveland has heard of
a man named Altpeld.
Begin the week by getting yonr name
on the register and urging your Republi
can friends to do likewise.
Monterey promises us something more
than a frolic. There will be patriotism as
well as beauty in her festival.
Russell and Pattison may have tlirown
their booms away, but Grover has packed
his in careful preservation for 1900.
Don't forget that this is to be a cam
paign for home industry and that the wel
fare of every home is concerned in it.
Every Republican club includes a good
many converts to the protective system,
and the campaign has hardly begun yet.
It is wise in the Democratic leaders to
pet out of the way of protection sentiment.
It is a case where they must either dodge
or be crushed.
Practically speaking the country is about
as much concerned in the wrangle at Chi
cago as it is in a Corbett and Fitzaimmons
jawing match.
>fcKin!ey never speaks without using
the word "prosperity." It is the object of
his thoughts and his policies and his elec
tion will mean it.
After the Chicago convention we shall
have to look to St. Louis apain. The
Populists will have to pop before all the
fat will be in the fire.
Some of the Democrats who are now
t-eeking a Presidential nomination will be
jrlad of a chance to run for poundmaster
in the next campaign.
The repeal of the protective tariH pre
cipitated the industrial depression, and
the re-establishment of protection will
CftOM an industrial revival.
"Wnen the votes are counted after elec
tion day it will be seen that California
has understood the situation clearly and
cast her ballot for a business revival.
It is hard to tell why Cleveland's friends
are going to the Democratic Convention
unless they think it proper to treat the
affair as a funeral which they oueht to
attend.
When a Democratic National Conven
tion deliberately ignores New York we can
safely say a new era has beÂ£Â»un. Such a
thing as this has never been known before
la all our history.
All California industries need protection
in order to yieid fair profits while paying
pood wages, and it is for protection there
fore that business men and working men
will unite in this campaign.
Cleveland may have been sincere in say
ing he has no higher ambition than to be a
private in the ranks of Democracy, but it
remains to be seen whether his adminis
tration has left any ranks in that party.
"Ov.r appeal," says McKinlev, "is not
to a false philosophy or to vain theories,
but to the masses of the American peo
ple â the plain, practical people whom
Lincoln loved and trusted, and whom the
Republican party has always faithfully
ttriven to serve." That appeal this year
will be responded to as it was in the days
of Lincoln. The people are for America
against the worid.
TO-MORROW AT CHICAGO.
To-morrow the Democratic party will
hold its sixteenth National convention to
nominate candidates for President and
Vice- President. The party has weathered
many internal and external storms since
IBS 2, when it named Andrew Jackson for
the Presidency. Tbe severest test of
strength tne party ever had before the
present battle of factions was in 1860,
when it was divided into two wings, one
under the leadership of Douglas and the
other under Breckinridge. But the wedge
which split the party at Charleston was
not driven with the vicious vigor and de
termination to destroy as it is being driven
at Chicago. Some of the greatest men the
country ever produced directed the fac
tions in 1860, but at to-morrow's conven
tion the most conspicuous feature will be
seen in the array of brainless asses who
will control the majority and lead the
party to its eternal damnation under the
generalship of Altgeld.
At Chicago to-morrow Altjreld will stand
tbe personification of the Democracy in
189(5 as Jackson stood the personification
of the Democracy at Baltimore in 1832.
What a spectacle of political degeneracy!
Jackson was inspired by the loftiest prin
ciples of truth, right and justice, and bis
patriotism was pure and true. He was
sincere in what he did, and his purpose
was to better the people's condition. The
light of events reveal his mistakes, but
who is perfect? But Altgeld is a very dif
ferent type of a man. He knows nothing
of the principles of risht or of truth or of
fastice. His sympathies are with those
principles of government which the Jeffer
sons, the Jacksons, the Bentons and the
Douglases spent their whole lives in con
demning. They sought political power
that they might wield it for the pub
lic good. Altgeld seeks power that
he may wield it to destroy that
principle of government which stands
for freedom under law and adopt in its
stead the principle of liberty without law,
and the majority of the Democratic party
cheerfully acquiesces and licks the boots of
the destroyer of their political honor. No
political party ever reached such depths
of degradation.
The hope has been all along that the
better element of the party would be able
to exert an influence for good, but the in
dications are that Altgeldism will sweep
the convention like a tornado. Altgeld is
trying very hard to set the West and South
against the East, and whatever is calcu
lated to engender hatred between the sec
tions he may be relied upon to employ to
the uttermost. He said the other day
that "the East is not worth saving."
The idea that he intended to con
vey was that the West and South should
array themselves against the East and
deprive it of political rights, and strange
as it may appear he was applauded
for making the suggestion. The surprise
that citizens of the United States would
permit a man to publicly use such treason
able language will be all the greater when
it is remembered that it was this same
Altgeld who referred to the -murderous
Haymarket anarchists e.s "patriots," and
denounced the courts for punishing them
for killing people. It is difficult to tell
what will be the outcome of a convention
that is dominated by such a character,
but there are those who firmly believe that
tnere will be a revolt against his authority.
One of the puzzling things about Alt
geld's programme is that he refuses to
commit Illinois to the candidacy of any
one, but those who know his political
methods to their sorrow say his plan is to
so manipulate the convention that hi 3
delegates will hold the balance of power
and then throw it to the candidate
who will give the largest mortgage on
himself for Altgeld's personal Tise, not
only in the way of shaping the policy of
the administration, should his man be
elected President, but in the control of
patronage. A'.tgeld is not himself eligi
ble for the Presidency, but it would make
no difference to him if he were, so far as
his ultimate purpose is concerned. The
overthrow of the existing order of things
and the practical application of anarchism
appear to be the chief object of his life.
For that, ns well as for many other rea
sons, the proceedings of the convention
will be watched with deep interest. If he
could accomplish his purpose better by
abandoning the free silver platform, he
would do it. He has no fixed principles
except such as are in harmony with the
doctrine of liberty without law, and he is
just now a political power in the land be
cause he is the supreme autocrat and dic
tator of the Democratic party.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PLAN.
The annual expenditures of the Govern
ment, however economical the adminis
tration in charge may be, are considerably
over $500,000,000, and instead of growing
less they are likely to grow larger from
year to year. For some years to come there
will have to be larger expenditures upon
our rivers and harbors and coast defenses.
In the matter of protection against attacks
by foreign warships it may be said tbat the
country has none. The United States
would have a very large mileage of sea
coast to defend in case of war, and the
country is unprepared for self-defense in
that direction.
The pension claims are necessarily and
properly very large. There will need be
large sums of money expended an
nually to pat our waterways in con
dition to give commerce wider oppor
tunity to accumulate and distribute
tbe produce of the country. The de
mand for American merchant ships is
so imperative that by common consent
the Government must provide the neces
sary financial encouragement. These are
by no means all the avenues of expendi
ture. They are only the more important
ones.
The question is then, How shall tbe
Government provide for these public ex
penses? It may be done by issuing bonds
from time to time, but the interest thereon
would increase the annual expense ac
count, to say nothing of a sinking fund to
provide for the redemption of the bonds
at their maturity. A general income tax
which would require every citizen to band
over to the Government a certain per cent
of his earnings could be made to provide
enough, but neither one of these proposi
tions would meet with the public's in
dorsement, especially an inco me tax, for
such a tax is the father of the meanest of
economic iniquities. The policy of the
Democratic party as represented by
the present administration appears to
be to Dile up deficit after deficit
and trust to luck, so to speak,
for something to turn up and pro- j
vide for their payment, and meanwhile
to issue bonds to keep the treasury sup
plied with gold for the money speculators
of 'Wall street and London to draw upon.
It will be observed that the Cleveland
plan of financiering does not provide a
sure and certain income for expenditures
upon internal improvements nor for sub
stantial aid to a merchant marine of our
own.
Now, the plan of the Republican party
to provide, and provide amply, for present
and prospective public expenditures is to
derive it, or a great deal of it, at the
several custom-houses from such foreign I
made goods and wares as are not profitable j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 6, 1896.
for us to make, but which we consume.
The Republican party proposes to make
importers of merchandise contribute
most liberally at the Custom-honse for the
privilege of doing business in our markets.
But although not enough revenue could
be derived from that source to supply the
demands of the Nation's expense account,
it would come so near doing it that a rea
sonable income upon beer and intoxicants
would not only be ample for the current
expense and internal improvement ac
counts, but there would be a balance
every year to be applied to the liquidation
of the Nation's bonds. This is the Re
publican party's policy and plan for the
administration of the affairs of tbe
country, xt is upon the same business
principle that good business men manage
their own enterprises.
NOT RIGHT, BUT WRONG.
Bad Alexander Pope been as much of a
prophet as he was a poet, and had allowed
his nropnetic eye to take a look at the
United States as they turned out to be
after Grover Cleveland and a Democratic
Congress were put in charge of the Gov
ernment, he never would have remarked
that "Whatever is is right." Nothing has
been right since Benjamin Harrison moved
out of the White House and Cleveland
moved in. Even the weather has been
wrong a great deal of the time.
Tens of thousands of good and
true working people have been in
enforced idlenes?, and the question of
getting enough to eat has been a serious
one with many of them. Industrial, com
mercial and mercantile enterprises have
been wrecked in every community, and
banking institutions all over the country
have been forced to close their doors.
Farmers have not received enough for
their produce to pay the cosi of raising it,
while more railways have been placed in
the hands of receivers than in any like
period in the history of rail transpor
tation. More river steamboats have been
lashed to wharves and dismantled than
in any other three years since the steam
boat was invented. In short, nothing has
been right in any field of occupation ex
cept the one in which Government bond
syndicates sow and reap.
The only thing that is that may be con
sidered right is the determination of the
people to get rid of Democratic free trade,
bond syndicates and hard times. What
ever of a public character Cleveland has
done the people know is wrong and no
good whatever has come of it. His "tariff
for revenue only" has impoverished our
industries ana left a deficit of nearly
$140,u00.000 for the people to make good.
Not only so, but he has obligated the peo
ple to pay over $,500,000,000 in principal and
interest. This additional indebtedness is
in the shape of bonds which he signed
in the name of the people. And still more,
he sold $62,000,000 of bonds at $104 when
the market price for that kind of Govern
ment securities was $119. The treasury gold
reserve is again close to the dangor point,
and another block of the people's obliga
tions will have to be marketed to pre
vent the treasury from putting up the
sign, "No Funds." No, Mr. Pope was
greatly mistaken. Whatever is just at
this time in the affairs of the Government
and ail lines of business is not only not
right but radically wrong.
ALTGELD VS. TAMMANY.
The most complex problem that is con
fronting Whitney, Hill and the other auto
cratic and aristocratic golabug Tammany
Democrats is bow they may escape from
the party's old ship without drowning.
Altgeld has been keeping them dancing
"on the burning deck" for some days and
I they want to get away. The shore is not
! far off, but how to reach it is the question.
| Still, they should not forget that when
j they were in command the Altgelds,
Blands, Tillmans and Haymarket rioters
made a pood enough crew. In fact, they
made exactly the kind of crew that was
wanted.
The fact of the matter is, Altgeld has in
troduced Tammany methods to Western
Democracy and in many ways he has
added improvements which make his
machine grind finer than the New York
Sachems are used to, and he has also
managed to get a good many of Tam
many's braves into the hopper of his mill.
There may be only just retribution in all
this, and no doubt there is, for Tammany
has turned out more finished political
bosses than any other institution of the
kind on earth.
l 1l 1 rom its birth, which was in the year
1789, it has heen turning such men as
Tweed into the highways of politics, and
if the Democracy of Illinois combined to
raise up a man who should out-Tammany
Tammany Sachems Whitney and Hill
should not complain too much, seeing
that their own close corporation has been
encouraging the employment of Altgeld's
kind of convention methods for more than
100 years. But Tammany never calls
anarchists "patriots," and Altgeld does,
which makes a difference that is alto
gether in favor of Tammany.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Sacramento See has entered upon its
eightieth volume, and commenced the latter
half of its thirty-ninth year of existence. The
Bee very modestly calls attention to this fact,
and very truthfully remarks that its name
"has become a household word in Northern
California, and its excellent record in the past
should be a sufÃcient guarantee of its course
in the future."
The California Fruit-Grnccr, which is doing
valuable service in its study and discussion of
the problems involved in the great and grow
ing fruit industry of this State, has begun its
nineteenth volume.
The Newsboys' Calamity Howler, a newspaper
published weekly in Portland, Or., in the in
terest* of the Populist party, has enlarged and
raised its subscription price. It announces
that it is In a state of progression, and feels
assured "that a daily output is in store" for
the paper.
The Introduction of an electric-light system
into Los Gatos is hailed by the Mail of that city
as marking a new epoch In the history of the
place. Henceforth, remarks the pa per. Lob
Gatos "will take its place as one of the modern
and progressive towns of California."
A promising deposit of asbestos on Mount
Diablo is one of the Important recent discov
eries. We learn from the Concord Sun that
George Condie, a bright young man from the
vicinity of Clayton, is the lucky individual,
and the piper continues : He has deepened his
mine in his spare hours, and the fine speci
mens of asbestos he has unearthtd give him
assurance that it will not be long before the,
vein will widen out before he descends many
more feet The indications are for an im
mense deposit of this valuable mineral, and as
he intends to develop this mine and interest
capital In the project there are many who will
be benefited should it be a successful under,
taking.
Porterville now comes to the front with the
information, through the Enterprise of that go
ahead town, tbat some valuab.e magnesite
mines located in Its neigborhood are to be
opened up and worked. "S. G. George has suc
ceeded in interesting some parties in the mine,
which is the property of W. P. Putnam, who
informed the Enterprise that he had decided
to accept the propositions made him and give
the parties the concession they asked. It goes
without saying thai it will be a fine thing for
Porterville, and give employment to a large
number of men and teams, as a furnace will
be erected lor calcining the uaagnesite prepara-
Tory to shipping it away. There are very few
places where magneslte can be found, and the
reports which have been made at different
periods have mentioned the fact that that
which abounds at Porterville Is of very fine
quality; therefore every one will be pleased to
hear of another addition to the many indus
tries of Porterville and vicinity."
The initial number of the Weekly Independent,
published by J. H.Stewart at Santa Barbara,
has been recoived. It prints at the head of its
editorial columns a Presidential ticket of its
own choice, with-J. C. Sibley ha the first posi
tion, S. M. White for his running mate antl H.
M. Teller for Secretary of the Treasury.
With reference to a movement now in
progress toward a division of large ranch prop
erties In Santa Clara County prompted by the
fact that the overland railroad connection by
way of San Jose, Santa Barbara, etc., will be
made within six months, the San Jose Herad
remarks that the Garden City and Santa Clara
County "have been sidetracked all these past
years of railroading in California. They have
been off through lines of travel. They have
grown and prospered by virtue of their natural
advantages and attractiveness, helped In some
measure by propinquity to San FraflcUco. But
the settler who had any curiosity about the
Santa Clara Valley as a place of residence had
to make a special trip to satisfy himself.
With through rail connection established
this will become the favorite passenger
route. The tourists will come to visit our
pleasure resorts of interest and the immigrant
Will keep his eye open for a good place to set
tle. The men who are cutting up the big
ranches evidently have these considerations
in view. When the immigrant is offered his
choice of half a dozen tiacts of land divided
into homesteads of just about the right size
with good soil, climate, water, roads, schools,
churches and social advantages he will realize
that he has indeed struck the garden spot of
California; that it has been prepared for his
reception, and that he has only to pay his
money, enter in and take possession. This
means an advance in land values in country
and city, extended trade and added prosperity.
It may be well lor landholders not to antici
pate and check this movement by putting
fancy prices on their property. That would be
to defeat their own purposes."
Large sums of money are being expended in
the development of the mines of Trinity Coun
ty, aud the Redding Free Press reports that the
McLean Brothers, contractors, who completed
the grading of the Iron Mountain Railway,
have secured a contract to run 8000 feet of
tunnel for a French syndicate, who are oper
ating great hydraulic mines near Weaverville.
"The water supply for the mines," says the pa
per, "is at present inadequate and the syndi
cate is now at work upon a plan to take water
from Stewart's fork and convey it by moans ef
ditches, flumes and pipes to its mines.
In order to avoid a long detour of the
ditch around the mountain a tunnel two
miles in length was begun. About 1100 feet
of. the tunnel is completed, and the McLean
brothers have taken the contract to complete
the remaining 9000 feet. The conveying of
the water is a great undertaking. The coun
try is exceedingly rough. The wagon road
runs to one end oi the tunnel, and from that
end to the opposite end, a distance of seven
miles, all supplies must be packed on horses.
The original survey showed that about three
miles of the flume could be used to advantage,
but on account of the high price of iron it is
now proposed to considerably increase the
length of the flume, reducing the quantity of
pipe. It is estimated that the tunnel will not
be completed before January 1, 1897."
The Winchester Recorder, after congratulat
ing San iacinto on the completion of its pump
ing plant, says that whatever their former
views of the Wright law may have been, San
Jacir. to people now will probably wish to see
it upheld. "In an irrigation district," ob
serves the Recorder, "there are always a few
who receive less value for taxes paid than the
majority, yet, ns a general proposition, the law
is just and should be sustained. An Irrigation
district of the people, for the people and by the
people Is founded Â»;pon the right principle,
and for the sake of the small farmer, who can
not afford to develop his own water or submit
to the exorbitant demands of an autocratic pri
vate water company, it is hoped that the dis
trict law will stand. This wish will probably
be shared by every municipality as well which
has voted bonds for a water system."
Stockton hopes to receive incidental aid from
the Government for Its protection from flood
water. Captain C. E. Gillette. United States
engineer, has been Inspecting Mormon Chan
nel and Calaveras River with the object of
ascertaining whether it would be possible to
prevent the depositing of debris In Stockton
Channel, and thereby save the Government
the expense of dredging it out continually.
"It requires no engineering," says the Stock
ton Mat.', "to see that the disposal of debris
carries with it the disposition of the water
which brings it down, and so it will be ap
parent to everybody that Captain Gillette's
visit may be of great significance to Stockton
in the matter of protection from flood-water.
To prevent debris from depositing In the
streams hereabouts, it must be delivered inte
the San Joaqnin River through a channel
which Is large enough to accommodate it and
VL-t small enough to keep itself scoured. There
are several ways in which the water that comes
down the Calaveras, and from that stream goes
Into Mormon Channel, can be conveyed to the
Ban Joaquin River without leaving any debris
behind, and Captain Gillette's object will be
to ascertain which is the cheapest and most
feasible of those ways."
According to the Los Angeles Times the
crude oil outlook in that city is now more en
couraging for both producers and consumers.
Present development "promises abundant oil
for future needs at no higher figure than pres
ent prices, which gives Los Angeles the cheap
est fuel of any city in Southern California, if
not in the State. Cnder such stimulus manu
lactories should spring up iv this city and add
largely to our revenues and properties."
Enterprising Fresno citizens are investing
money in a petroleum-refining plant for that
city. "They intend," says the Expositor, "to
ship the product of the Coaling oil fields to
this city and here rehne it. The refining works
will not at first be a very large concern, but if
its proprietors meet with the success they de
serve it will without doubt be enlarged. The
works will be completed and in operation
within thirty days."
SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN LIFE.
New York Sun.
In a speech which Lord Kelvin, better
known in this country as Sir William Thom
son, recently made in reply to the congratula
tions offered him at the jubilee of his first ap
pointment as professor of natural philosophy
in Glasgow University, we flna this striking
passage:
One word characterizes the most strenuous of
the efforts for the advancement of science that I
have made perseverlngly through fifiy-flve years;
that word is failure; I know uo more of electric
aod mHgnetic force, or of the relations between
cth-r, electricity and ponderable matter, or of
chemical affinity, than I knew and tried to teach
my studenu of natural philosophy fifty years ago
la my first session as professor.
Commenting on these words the London
Times the next day summed up Lord Kelvin's
achievements thus:
He has Klven us thetheory of the speed of elec
tric signaling tiirough submarine cables, and has
rendered the most effective assistance to ihr estab
lishment of electric telegraphs to the most distant
parts of oar planet. Be has investigated all the
causes of the disturbance of tne mariner's com
pass and shown bow to allow for them. He has
â¦â fleeted the most signal improvements In tbe art
or deep-sea sounding. He baa shown how to pre
dict tbe ris? and fall of tbe ti :e Id any given place.
lie has altogether revolutionized the instruments
for electrical measurements, and made the mod
trn electroscopes and electrometers what they are.
He Ims discovered balances for welching electric
currents and for measuring electric power and en
ergy. Me has elaborated the mathematical thtory
of electricity. And hÂ« d:recied hia great colleague,
the late Professor C'erk Maxwell, to the right
method of pursuing his own electrical studies.
Lord Kelvin is not the first great man to
whom his own work, highly as it was es
teemed by others, has been insufficient to con
tent him*elf. His self-depreciation recalls the
well-known sayiug of Sir Isaac Newton: "I do
not know what I may appear to the world, but
to myself I seem to have been only a boy play
in* on the seashore and diverting myselt in
finding now and then a smoother pebble or a
prettier shell than ordinary, while the great
ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."
Indeed, no man with lofty ideals ever attains
them to his own satis faction, and it may com
fort less eminent laborers in the field of hu
man effort, who are despondent at their appar
ent want of success, to reflect that the greatest
of their fellow-laborers have been oppressed
by the game sense of iaiiure.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
N. A. Covarrubias, the United States Marshal
of Los Angeles, was sitting in the Palace the
other day, engrossed in a newspaper account
of Democratic prospects, when A. S. Cooper,
ex-County Surveyor of Santa Barbara, came up
and interrupted him with, "Hello, Nick, wnat
are you looking so d sour about? Let's go
have something."
The Marshal folded The Call up carefully,
tucked it away in an inside pocket and, with
deliberate, exact enunciation, replied: "Well,
Cooper, the old party isn't all like you, to be
UNITED STATES MARSHAL N. A. COVARRUBIAS OF LOS ANGELES.
elected Councilman where Republicans were
so thick that three of them contested for
Mayor."
And as they sat down to one of the small
tables in the court and gave their orders an
old gentleman in clerical garb looked up dis
approvingly from the open pages of a black
book with gilt edges.
"Well, Cooper, how is my old friend La Vies,
the Joaquin Miller of Santa Barbara?"
"The what!" said Cooper. "I never heard
him called that."
'â¢Oh, you know they say the poet of the
Sierras hasn't cut his hair since he took a
batn, and La Vies must have been letting his
hair grow ever since Dr. C. C. O'Donnell first
began running for Mayor of San Francisco. I
remember when La Vies was Postmaster dur
ing Cleveland's first term, and all the Re
publicans used to worry the life out of him
kicking if the mail arrived late. When a train
would be behind time they would stand out
side the partition ana talk loud and keep un
locking their boxes and saying, 'It wouldn't
be this way with a Republican Postmaster.'
"But I heard a good one the other day,
Cooper. I was coming up on the train from
Los Angeles and two girls were sitting in the
car. One says, ' What do you do when you pet
to Snnta Barbara, isn't it awfully dull?' 'No,
indeed, 1 says thu other. 'You go seabathing,
horseback riding: you visit the old Mission
and El Montecito and you are proposed to by
some young fellow who lives in Â£1 Montecito,
descendant of an old South Carolina family,
brother to a judge in San Francisco, and all
that. Anyway that's what all the girls say
that have been there.' "
"I know a better one than that," said
Cooper, as he launched into a story that
caused the clerical-looking old gentleman to
glance about cautiously and then edge his
chair up a little nearer behind a friendly
pillar where none of the spicy yarn might be
lost.

Harrow took with him the liveapteryx or kiwi,
the curious windless, nocturnal filleyloo-like
bird native only to New Zealand. He had I
hoped to sell it here for $25. The Park Com- I
missioners, inasmuch as it was the first live |
one ever brought to America, offered to take it
for nothing. Some one else said he would give
$15 for the bird dead, that he might stuff it.
But the old gentleman, with a tenacity of pur
pose characteristic of Johnny Bull, is deter
mined to get his price if he has to carry the
unattrnctive-loolting, carnivorous, odoriferous I
pet all the way to England and pay more than j
that amount for its keep and its transportation, j
for he. 6ays that if it dies on his hands he can |
still get the $15 for it. He paid a native $10 !
for the bird and then, with infinite patience, '
taught the ugly thing to eat meat that it might
live away from its native island.

With Eczema
I wa* a sufferer for eight years from Eczema, but
now am entirely cured. The palms of my hands
were covered and badly inflamed; little white
blisters appeared, then would peel off, leaving
a red, smooth surface, which would burn like
fire and itcb. On the inside of the upper part of
my limbs, great red blotches would appear, and
os soon as I became warm, the burning and itch-
ing would begin. Night after night I would lie
awake and scratch, and almost go wild. â  I got a
box of Ccticuka, and a bottle of CcTicr/BA Kb-

the redness and inflammation disappear ; Off ore I

The Naval Reserve monitor Comanche

day aboard, and a number of tugs carried
passengers to and from the two vessels.
The monitor, with her white awnings
spread, colors flying, officers and men in
mustering uniform, tried to hide her age
and appear Amazon-like in the presence of
her big but younger sister lying very fresh

The Charleston in a new, snowy coat of

the Union Iron Works an infant in 1869.
Colonels ChadDourne, Vail and San born of
the Governor's staff went out to the vessel,
first visiting Lieutenant-Commander Tur

steaming in their launch over to the

ships of the United States and English
Bquadrons respectively.
The German ship Christine arrived in
this port yesterday, si.^ty-four days from
Sydney. N. S. W.. being twenty days
Blower than on her former trip.
Nothing of any importance occurred on
her voyage until last Friday afternoon,
when she reached a point about forty miles
northerly from Point Reyes. There she
was sighted by the steamer Mineola
headed toward the shore under a full
spread of canvas. A heavy fog was on the
sea and Captain Warneke of the Christine
was evidently away off his bearings. The
Mineola sounded a warning blast with her
whistle and signaled in the international
code, "Breakers ahead of you," and in
structed the ship to steer wide of the land.
The Christine answered and chanced
her course. The two vessels ran on the
same course, the steamer gradually draw
ing away from the sailer.
Suddenly the ship was observed to haul
her wind and head again for the shore.
Captain Pillsbury again warned the ship
of daneerand the signal was answered.
Presently the fog hid both vessels, but the
steamer turned and sought out the Cans
tine, and found her when the fog lifted
about a mile from the breakers. The Min
eola steamed in close to the ship and gave
her the true course. Her captain must
have followed these instructions faithfully,
as his vessel arrived safely in port.

A MORPHINE "FIEND."
Henry Dixon Attempts to Commit
Suicide in the City
Prison.
Henry Dixon, a young man who is a
physical wreck from the use of morphine,
attempted to commit suicide in a cell in
tbe City Prison yesterday afternoon.
He and five others were arrested last
Wednesday for vagrancy, and Dixon was
sentenced on Friday to six months in the
County Jail. He was constantly begging
the prison officials to give him morphine,
but his pleadings were useless.
Yesterday he broke the handle off an
iron bucKet in his cell, and when no one
was watching him, he cut his arm with
the rough end of tbe handle, and then
used it as a saw with the object of catting
all the arteries.
Tbe other prisoners gave the alarm, and
Dixon was taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal, wherere Dr. Fitzgibbon dressed his
wounded arm, and he was taken back to
prison.
Captain Robinson thought that Dixon
never contemplated suicide, but cut his
arm simply to try and create sympathy
so that he could get a "shot" of the drug.

ELDER TANNER SPEAKS
Exhorts Members of the Mormon Mis
sion to "Seek First the King
dom of God."
Elder Henry S. Tanner, president of the
California Mormon Mission, addressed a
large audience in Pythian Castle last ni^ht
upon the text "Seek First the Kingdom of
God." In the course of his address Elder
Tanner said:
"The church represents Christ's spiritual
kingdom and governs the spiritual con
cerns, and only those who accept the gos
pel can become members of the church;
but when the kingdom of God is wholly in
effect it will govern the civil or temporal
as well as the spiritual, and nations may
be members of the kingdom though not
members of the church, for all men will be
permitted to worship God according to the
dictates of their conscience.
'â¢The spiritual kingdom, dealing with
spiritual man, has an external or visible
organization, consisting of apostles, proph
ets, pastors and teachers. Gifts and bless
ings follow the believers and those who
conform to the laws of repentance and re
demption through Jesus, and will work a
reformation in the hearts of the people and
make them better in every way."

GOVERNOR BUDO
AND THE STARS,
Aspirations for the High
Rank of Major-
General.
THE NATIONAL GUARD.
Warfield, Clunie, Turnbulb
Sumner, Macdonaid and
James.
THE BE COEDS DISPLAYED.
Adjutant-General Barrett Said to
Prefer Warfield's Pro
motion.
The duty now devolves upon Governor
Budd, commander-in-chief of the military
force of California, to appoint a major
general to fill the vacancy caused by the
Thomas J. Clnnie, Who Is a Candidate for Major-General to Succeed General
Dimond, Deceased.
death of General W. H. Dimond, division
commander of the National Guard.
The Governor is not troubled in the
slightest by the lack of application. It is
said that Brigadier-General R. S. War
field, Becond Brigade, would like to wear
the stars of the high rank, and that Adju
tant-General Barrett would take pleasure
in making out General Warlield's commis
sion. The matter could be arranged so
easily that the Governor would have noth
ing to do but sign the commission.
But there are others ; and rumor goes
around the camp that Thomas J. Clunie,
ex-brisadier-general, who bravely led the
Sacramento brigade to many inaugural
balls, would shake hands with the Gov
ernor over a major-general's commis
sion. The eloquent Tom and the impul
sive Jim have not been on terms of cor
diality since "Andy" was turned down to
give William M. Hinton the desirable
berth of Registrar of Voters in San Fran
cisco. Indeed the general left the Gov
ernor's office one day with his mind made
up never to cross the threshold of the ex
ecutive room In the State Capitol while
Governor Budd was inside.
In these days fraught with great issues
and holding forth prospects of great
honors, wise statesmen change their
minds and able soldiers change front. So
now it is considered sure that General
Clunie would accept a favor from Gov
ernor Budd; also that Andy's grief in see
ing Hinton commanding at the registra
tion office would be sensibly lightened by
seeing Thomas J. in command of the Na
tional Guard.
To the front comes Major D. E. Miles,
making a gallant contest in behalf of
Colonel William Macdonaid, First Infan
try, N. G. C. The colonel is now in Hawaii.
Indeed, he is the most unfortunate ot Na
tional Guard officers. Nothing happens
when he stays at home, but everything oc
curs when he leaves town. When the
troops were ordered to Sacramento two
years ago the colonel was East. He
hastened home with all the- speed possi
ble, but the strikers impeded travel, and
so while the colonel was across the moun
tains cursing fate that deprived him of the
chance for promotion, his subordinate,
Lieutenant-Colonel Geary, was at the head
of the Second Artillery gathering up
glory by the yardâ the West Oakland
yards.
Now the colonel was at Honolulu when
the vacancy in the major-eefneralshiD oc
curred. He is absent while Warfield is on
the field personally directing movements.
But Colonel Macdonald's tried and true
friend, his trusted champion and able
subordinate, Major D. E. Miles, is not idle.
He is doing the work of two majors in the
cause of the absent colonel.
Ex-Major-General Walter Turnbull, who
commanded the troops in the celebrated
engagement at Tripe Hill, Santa Cruz,
during Governor Stoneman's administra
tion, is on the list of applicants for the
honor of leading the division.
General Turnbull has the advantage of
being a Democrat as well as a soldier,
while several of his competitors in the
contest are Republicans. General Turn
bull got his former commission as major
general without much ado or delay, but
he did have a monkey and a parrot time
with the late Adjutant-General Orton in
getting on the retired list with the rank of
major-genera!. If Governor Waterman
and Marcus D. Boruck had not sustained
General Turnbull with great gallantry
and fortitude the latter would have gone
on the retired list with honors skorn and
rumpled. No question was ever raised
about General Turnbull's pulchritude,
patriotism or proficiency, but General
Orton bad some ideas about the length of
service required for retirement and re
fused to accord the rank.
Last but not least in the list of appli
cants is Colonel Frank W. Sumner, who
served with distinction ad paymaster-gen
eral on the staff of Governor Markham.
As a tactician in a military sense he is by
far the superior of all other applicants,
but he is classed as a Republican in poli
tics. What he lacks in respect to party
devotion may be offset by personal influ
ence.
Colonel Nat T. James is mentioned as
an aspirant, but his recent promotion
from manager of an insurance company
to the rank of colonel is thought by many
to be the full measure of his ambition.
He is, nevertheless, regarded by all com
petitors for the place as a dangerous wire,
because he enjoys the special confidence
of the commander-in-chief. Colonel
James was educated at Annapolis for
service in the United States navy, but
this would not disqualify him from lead
ing the division.
MERRY STEVEDORES.
Forty-Third Keunion of Their Asso
ciation.Celebrated at Schuetzen
Park.
The Riggers' and Stevedores' Union
Association made merry at Schuetzen
Park yesterday. About 700 members and
friends of the organization visited the
park, and with picnic, sports and dancing
the forty-third reunion of the association
was made a decided success.
The games, which were under the man
agement of Morris Keane, Michael Hag
gerty, Dennis Lahey, William Drayton
and Michael McMahon, as judges, were
particularly interesting, and the prizes,
which ranged from a ton of coal to a
barrel of beer, were all well earned by the
winners.
The latter part of the day was devoted
to dancing. N. McCracken officiated as
floor manager and P. Northing as assist
ant. The floor committee was James
HumDhrev, Lawrence Smith and Thomas
White. To Alexander Campbell, presi
dent of the association, much credit is due
for the success of the picnic.
THE MORGUE WAGON BUSY
Coroner's Deputies Kept on the
Run Yesterday Fore
noon.
Gas Used by Three Men Who Made
Up Their Minds to
"Quit."
The Morgue wagon was kept busy yes
terday forenoon, no less than six cases
having been reported before the noon
hour. Of these three were suicides by the
gas avenue of exit.
William Hanson, aged 49, a native of
Germany and a widower, who resided at
920 Buchanan street, was found by Mrs.
Juncker, who smelled escaping gas in the
room occupied by Hanson. Sne notified
the police and the patrol wagon was sent
out to take him to the Receiving Hos
pital, but before he reached there he died,
and the body was taken to the Morgue in
stead.
It is surmised that he became dis
heartened over the conditions of the will
Jeft by his wife, who died a short time
since. She left him $1, giving the re
mainder of her property to her children
by a former husband. The deceased left
two children, a son and a daughter. He
was a member of the Knights of Honor.
William McCormack, a solicitor for any
thing that came in his line, saw fit to take
his leave by the same agency as Hanson.
He resided at 2028 Fulton street, and was
aged 45 years. A collection of well-writ
ten poetry was found among bis effects,
one piece setting lorth that no bells woula
toil or friends weep over his death.
Simon Askins, aged 54, a native of Rus
sia and a discharged soldier of the United
Stated army, with a first-class character,
followed the others by the same means at
957 Market street.
The case of Askins left no doubt of his
suicide, as he left a letter for his wife giv
ing full instructions to apply to the mili
tary authorities at tne Phelan building to
have him interred in the National Ceme
tery at the Presidio, and also to apply to
the United States Government pension
agent for a pension as his widow, saying
that the amount given her would support
her and their two boys until such time as
they could, help themselves.
Adkina' discharge snowed that he bad
served in the Federal army for two years
as a volunteer during the late war. After
ward, in 1866, enlisted in the regular
army and served twenty-four years, mak
ing twenty-six years' service "altogether;
his last discharge being dated July, 1895.
Another letter was directed to the Cor
oner informing him that there would be
no necessity to hold a post mortem over
his body a* he committed suicide.
Harry W. Parker, aged 30 years, died
suddenly from natural causes at 609 Bush
street.
Louise Vasselin, aged 77, a native of
France, was found dead in her bed at 393
Sixth street from the effects of old age.
Margaret Barbara, an infant aged 7
months, died suddenly at 458% Minna
Btreet.
Such was the record of the Coroner's
books for Sunday forenoon.
An Emporium Window Broken.
One of the large plate-glass windows in the
Emporium building on. Market street was
cracked by one of the Fourth of July missiles
which were so liberally fired off during the
eelebr&tiou. One of the watchmen claims that
he found a dynamite cap In close proximity to
the broken window and thinks that caused
the mischief.
FEAR FREE SPEECH
IS IN JEOPARDY.
Socialists Will Fight Bit
terly For Their
Rights.
WM, COSTLEY'S ARREST
Eminent Legal Talent Will
Plead in Court for Him
To-Day.
NOT A QUESTION OF DOCTRINE
Captain Spiilane Says the Speaker
Was Arrested for Obstruct
ing the Street
The case of William Costley, the social
ist orator who was arrested last Thursday
night on Seventh street for obstructing the
street, will come up in court for trial
to-day.
The socialists believe that discrimina
tion is being shown against them simply
on account of the nature of their utter
ances, and they intend to right the case to
the bitter end. "\\ T ith this motive in view
they have behind them the full support of
all organized labor in the City. Eminent
legal talent has already been consulted,
and the socialists feel almost certain that
Costley will be acquitted as were other
socialist speakers similarly charged about
a year ago.
Theodore Lynch, one of the prominent
speakers among -the socialists and secre
tary of the Central Trade and Labor Alli
ance, said last evening: "The next night
after Costley was arrested we continued
the meetings on the steps of the Mint
building. A large crowd congregated to
listen to us, but the police did not inter
fere.
'â¢Nothing of this kind is new to the so
cialists," continued Mr. Lynch. "It is
the same in Russia. A speaker is arrested
and is never again heard of there, unless
tome one happens to be passing through
Siberia.
"As soon as the news of Costley's arrest
was known we said we would rally again,
and considered it our duty to do so.
Despite this kind of persecution and ar
rest, socialism has progressed wonder
fully. Men know that socialism is a bless
ing in disguise.
"The party is by no means deterred
from continuing its open-air meetings,
which are a feature of its propaganda. The
various branches have developed a corps
of intelligent speakers, who will be heard
from on the stump in the coming cam
paign.
"The socialists regard this interruption
in a philosophic light and believe it will
redound to the interest of the rights of
every citizen. This interference menaces
the rights of every editor in the public
expression of his opinions. It is indi
rectly aimed at the right of free press and
free speech. While the leaders of the
socialist party do not look for any daz
zling success politically in the near future,
still they are active in the preservation of
their rights as free citizens, and judging
from the past history of their movements
elsewhere they have a bright future.
"The party nas consulted with eminent
lawyers to assist it in this present case.
Should the court decide adversely we will
fight the matter vigorously.
"The right of free speech, which has
been interfered with in this instance, is in
defiance to the constitution of tiie United
States and the socialists look upon the
matter seriously. These occasional inter
ruptions of peaceably and quietly con
ducted meetings are hard to account for
in any other lignt than as a blow aimed at
the free expression of a man's thoughts.
"Socialists have ever rezarded any at
tack or interferences on their speeches as
a light to additional propaganda; and
such arrests have almost invariably led to
the conversion of both Judge and jury, l
consulted Taylor Rogers on this arrest and
he expressed himself as being, unquali
fiedly against such interference."
J. W. Rose, ex-secretary of the Building
Trades Council, Baid: "It is the sentiment
of all the unions that this interference was
uncalled for and illegal, and something
that they will fight to the bitter end. We
will sustain the socialists in this propo
sition morally and financially. The so
cialists can always count on organized
labor when any such question as this is at
issue."
Captain Spillane said : "William Costley,
or easterly, was arrested last Thursday
night on Seventh street at 9 o'clock sim
ply for drawing a crowd tnat obstructed
the street. We do not care what the man
says, but no matter who he may be, if he
obstructs the streets he must be arrested.
Of course, if a speaker says things that
may incite a riot we would have to arrest
him. We do not arrest the speakers on
tin Mint steps for the reason that they are
out of the way. Still, if they were guilty
oi obstructing the streets we should cer
tainly arrest them. Sentiments have
nothing whatever to do with it. It is sim
ply a matter of street obstruction."
L. M. Manzer, corresponding secretary
of the Free Press Association, expressed
himself wholly against police interference
in special cases if the case does not trans
gress a City ordinance.

HONORED THEIR
PATRON SAINT,
Impressive Services Con
ducted at St. Peter's
Church.
AUTHORITY NECESSARY.
Rev. Peter C. Yorke Explains
the Necessity of Central
ization.
ONE GOD AND ONE CHURCH.
People of St. Peter's Admonished to
Pray for the Union of
Christendom.
The feast ol St. Peter was celebrated
with unusual solemnity and splendor at
the edifice bearing his name.
"St. Peter's never witnessed such a scene
before," declared Father Lyons at the
conclusion of the services, and the con
course of people of the parish who had as
sembled to do reverence to their patron
saint was truly something of which the
parish priests might be proud.
The feast of St. Peter is ordinarily ob
served June 29, but on this occasion it was
postponed until the Sunday succeeding.
A solemn high mass was celebrated by
Father Casey, assisted by Father Lyons
deacon, Father O'Ryan subdeacon and
Father Lynch of St. James Church master
of ceremonies. The music, which was
rendered by a choir specially trained for
the occasion, was under the direction of
Miss Mamie Coonan, organist. It was of
an unusually high order.
Tne sermon was delivered by Rev. Peter
C. Yorke, and the earnest attention which
the congregation gave to his remarks
testified to the esteem in which he is held
by the people of his faith. The theme of
his discourse was the necessity of
aut ority in order to have unity in the
church.
In temporal affairs, he said, unity is
effected by authority of the government.
The central Government at Washington
preserves unity in civil affairs, ana so is
authority necessary in the affairs of the
church. " Tne necessity of unity, he de
clared, was evident, else there would be a
constant state of confusion.
The speaker then compared this country
in regard to civil affairs with the church
in matters spiritual. He showed that just j
as the States, jealous of one another in
many ways, are veld together by authority
of Congress, tbe church is kept together
tbrouga its trials by a centralized au
thority.
"Until 360 years ago," he said, "there [
was unity in tne church, and that was as i
our Lord wished it to be. We hear those |
outside the church constantly, saying, â¢
'Search the Scriptures.' Let us "search the
Scriptures."
The speaker here referred to a number
of passages in the Bible from which he ]
adduced authority for an individual head
to the ennrch. "There is one Lord, one
faith, one baptism, one God," ne said, "so
there must be only one true church.
"The Lord appointed St. Peter supreme
head of his church. He said to him: j
'Thou art Peter, and upou this rock I will j
build my churcn, and I will give to tliee j
the keys ol the kingdom of heaven. Feea
my lambs. Feed my sheep.' And though
Peter had once been lacking in faith ne
gav<> him authority over me others. He
said to him, 'When thou art converted
confirm thy brethren.' These words show
that the Lord gave Peter autnority over
his church."
Father Yorke deplored the disruption of
Christendom, and declared that the dis
union arose chiefly from want of author
ity. There was uc guide to direct. "On
this day, the least of St. Peter,' he con
cluded, "the people of St. Peter's honor
the patron of this church. Pray that the
day may soon come when the disunion
will cease to be, and all people will be
witbin one church and worshiping one
God."
REUNION AT FRUITVALE.
Parishioners of St. Francis Church
Enjoy a Patriotic
Outlngr.
A merry reunion of the St. Francis
Church parishioners took place at Putts'
ville Park, Fruitvale, on July 4. The ex
ercises were interspersed with skillful
games of endurance and strength. The
Cosmopolitan Military band discoursed
music, and the platform at times was
crowded with yonng dancers.
The running races were the cynosure for
thousands and were well contested, pro
fessionals being barred.
In the race for young ladies much ri
valry was engendered, but an untoward
accident marred the contest. The daugh
ter of J. Wrede. 733 Union street, fell and
lractured her right arm. The fathers im
mediately dispatched for a surgeon.
Throwing the heavy weight, 56 lbs, was
hotly contested, and the prize was won by
the pastor, Father Carraher, who stands
over six feet and weighs 220 pounds of
avoirdupois. He immediately >&A that
"Heaven loved a cheerful giver," and i
forthwith distributed the $10 to the girls
to purchase firecrackers for the occasion.
The reception committee, under the
skiilful management of T. B. Cunning
ham, distributed seventy-eight gate prizes.
At the northwest corner of the park an
impromptu patriotic demonstration was i
had, and progressed uninterruptedly dur
ing the day. under the direction of the
younger element of the parish. The cen
tral figure of the extemporaneous display
of enthusiasm was Paul A. McCarthy, who
with histrionic effect read the Declaratir>n
of Independence, aud recited Drake's
"Address to the American Flag."
Firecrackers and cheers for the American
flag concluded the entertainment.
NO FUSION POSSIBLE.
The State Central Committee, of the
Populist Part Kxpresses Itself
on Democracy.
At a meeting of the executive committee
of the Populist State Central Committee
held in this City last Saturday, the follow
ing resolution on the Democratic nominee
was adopted:
Whereas, The metropolitan press of the two
old parties is continually misstating the posi
tion of the People's party, and thereby is mis
leading the uninformed regarding the People's
party position on preat National questions, and
especially as to its attitude toward indorsing
i he Democratic nominee for President of tiie
United States, should such nominee be a silver
candidate; . : - - - â¢â¢ â .- â¢ â 
.- Therefore, the State Executive Committee of
the People* party of California, ill session ; on
July 4. 1896, in the most emphatic manner,
declares t.iat at no time and at no place has it
considered that sucn v union or ration or com
bination or indorsement would be either possi
ble or desirable.
Furthermore, We declare that, as a commit
tee, we will not support the | Democratic nomi
nee for President under any circumstances.
That the reason for such â  action arises from
the fact that the Democratic part is a party of
. contcrvatism and Is antagonistic to the princi
ples of l'ornilism/iigg^sg&3*J?S*SSSs?**S!iÃPÂ»QÂ¥s
That It lit a party which has been discredited
by the people, and an indorsement of its nomi
nee by us would be taken as an indorsement of
its record. This we will never give.
Furthermore, we do not believe that on the
silver question the Democratic party is actu
ated by motives of principle, but by motives of
policy, and that as a party it can never secure
the free coinage of silver or of any needed
monetary reform.
Therefore the people as a whole would be
injured by a surrender of our principles and
the disbandment of the People's party, which
would ensue if we were to indorse a Demo
cratic nominee.
Furthermore, we consider that the great re
forms in government which the People's party
demand cannot be obtained, or even advanced,
by a fusion, or combination, or indorsement,
with either of the old parties.
tAN Francisco, Cal., July 4, 1896.
The following is the circular to People's
.Party voters of California:
Registration of voters under the old law was
kept open until within a few days of the elec
tion. By an amendment of the election laws
enacted in 1895 the registration of voters in
your county will close ou August 8 or 10.
This change in the law is not fully understood,
and it is your duty to take steps at once to see
that every Peoples-Party man is notified of
this fact. You must make it your business to
urgo and see ihat all Pepulists register immeai
ately. Failure to do bo means that thousands
of our voters throughout the State will be dis
franchised.
By order of tne executive committee, People's
Party. E. M. Warda^l, Chairman.
R. E. Bush. Secretary.
San Francisco, July 4, 1896.
ATTAR OF ROSES.
It >1Â»y After All Be Adjudged Exempt
From Duty.
The following communication has been
received :
San Frawcisco, Cat., July 5, 1896.
Editor Call: I notice an article in your issue
of tbe Ist in st. under tbe head of "Attar of
Koses," stating that an invoice of mine had
been held at the Custom-house, indicating
that my goods had been seized for duty. It it
true thtit I had an invoice of the article named
and that a question of the duly thereou bns
been raixed, but the merchandise has not been
seized. Under the Wilson and previous acts
attar of roses is free of duty by name, without
auy words of limitation whatt-wr. The Col
lector of Customs is disposed to collect dnty
upon it as an "essential oil," and that ques
tion has gone to the Board of General Apprais
ers; but I apprehend that the Collector's
action will not be sustained, because the rule
of construction is well settled, that a specitil
section relieving attar of roses from duty will
control a general section assessing duty upon
essential oils, of which attar oi roses is one o.f
many. 1 have imported this commodity be
fore and it has passed the cv.- turns officials
without imposition of duty. Yours,

FINANCES Of NATIONS.
The Recent Heavy Bond Issue
of the Empire of
Japan.
Her National War Debtâ A Big De
posit and Increased Internal
Expenses.
The existing financial policy of Japan
is likely to exert a greater or less influence
upon the future actions of other nations,
especially those that have invested in her
newly issued bonds. S. Hayakawa, pri
vate secretary to the Minister of Finance
of Japan, said yesterday:
"There is now on deposit in the Bank of
England the sum of Â£22.717.889 to the
credit of the island empire, and America
and England are watching anxiously to
see what she will do with it. Under the
system lately adopted by Viscount Wata
nabe, the Minister of Finance, there will
be. a great increase in the governmental
expenditure.
"The national debt of Japan ($196,
-131,000) was the result principally ol the
change irom the feudal to the State sys
tem of government and of the reorganiza
tion of its finances necessitated by the
late war with China. The ancient foreicn
debt will be liquidated within a year and
recently Europeans and Americans have
been investing liberally in Japanese bonds.
These bonds comprise the feudal pension,
the naval, the consolidation, the war and
the state railway bonds.
"Tbe war bond was issued last year and
bears interest at the rate of 5 per cent per
annum. The railway bond, issued in 1892,
has been gradually increased until it now
amounts to 6,000,000 yen.
"It is expecied by her Ministers that the
public loan of Japan will be somewhat in
creased in tne future to permit oi the
speedy construction of railroads, etc., but j
tbe policy of the Government is cautious â 
and opposed to incurring any debt until a
way has been devised for its payment.
"The Bank of Japan issues the only !
paper money, which is convertible with sil
ver, on demand. The national bank notes
are being gradually replaced by the paper
money. The Bank of Japan, in Tokio,
under the strict supervision of the Gov
ernment, is now authorized to issue only
paper money, convertible with silver."
BE LIVED LONG IN SIAM,
Rev. Dr. McFarland, Founder of
the First English School
in Bankok.
Author of Siamese School and Scien
tific Books â He Came Here
to Live.
Rev. Dr. 8. G. McFarland, for thirty-six
years a resident of Bankok, Siam, has
come from the Orient to spend his de
clining years in Berkeley or in Oakland.
He arrived yesterday on the City of
Peking with his wife and daughter and his
son, Dr. George McFarland, physician in
charge of a large hospital in .Bankok, the
capital of Siam.
"I went to Siam in 1860," said the aged
clergyman, when seen at the Occidental
last night, "not in a palatial ocean erray
hound. but in a small sailing vessel, by
way of the Cape of Good Hope.
"For the first fourteen or fifteen years I
was engaged in missionary work in con
nection with the Presbyterian Missionary
Society of America. Then I was appointed
by the King to establish and take charge
of a high-class school for the young
princes and the youths of the first families.
"It was the first English school in Ban
kok and was modeled on American lines.
I began with sixty pupils, and there were
300 boys of the best famines under my
care whtn I left the school in 1891.
"For the next three years 1 was en
gaged in compiling school-books in Siam
ese â a geography and first, second and
third readers, much after the general
style of the school text-books used In
America.
"I al?o wrote some scientific works deal
ing with the botany and the geology of
Siara. Latterly I have arranged in the
Siamese language a series of books on both
single and double entry bookkeeping.
"Bankok, I suppose, has a population of
about 400.000 or 500,000, but the Govern
ment has never taken a census. It is the
lamest city in the kinpdom. Foreigners
estimate the population of the whole coun
try at from 5,000,000 to 8,000,000.
"The Siamese are bri-rht and progres
sive, but not so much so a? the Japanese.
The KmÂ» â 1 have Known him since he
was a little boyâ is very desirous of im
proving his people, Â«nd he is well liked.
"The exports of Siam are raw silk,
hides, teakbark, tenbark and rice. The
natives do a pood deal of fine art work in
gold and silver in knd for ti.e palace."
Mr. McFarland is broken down in health
and has chosen the neighborhood of San
Francisco, he says, as second to Honolulu,
the paradise of the Pacific. He has relaÂ»
- -es In Pennsylvania and Ohio.

residents has destroyed the power of the
Democrats to lay claim to it any longer.
This change is due in a great measure to
the growth of the City and tbe high death
rate of old-timers, known to tbe early
pioneers as men who would rather vote
early and olten than attend a doÂ«-hi:ht.
The Republican club recently formed in
the Forty-fifth has also had a great in
fluence toward increasing the moral tore
of the politics of that locality. The ciub
was organized in December, 1895, and has
a membership of 400. It was reorganized
Jnne 4 with the followinpomcers: Charles
G. Nagle, president; M. E. Babb, vice
president; W. S. Wood, secretary, and
William Shew, treasurer. The executive
committee is composed of: M. E. Babb.
chairman; R. E. Silveria, W. S. Wood, C.
J. Ward, J. F. Lawaon, W. Shew, T. J.
Stanton, L. Kirschbaum, Philip Brown
and W. A. Scott. This committee has
been authorized to procure suitable head
quarters for the club during the campaign.
In view of the action recently taken by
the County Committee in increasing its
number, this club unanimously indorsed
W. S. Wood as the additional member
from the district. Mr. Wood will prove a
very acceptable member of that body. If
elected he will iook attentively after the
interests of his section of the City in his
capacity as an executive officer. He has
the respect and confidence of his associ
ates in the club and of the better class of
residents in the district.
FOR A HOSPITAL ONLY,
The Angel Island Post for Mili
tary Purposes May Be
Abandoned.
Applications to Succeed Admiral
Eeardslee, U. S. N , as Commander
of the Pac fie Squadron
Angel Island as a military post may
be abandoned and the troops of t'>e United
States Infantry there stationed be trans
ferred to the Presidio and Benicia Bar
racks. In case this project is carried out
the United States Marine Hospital, now
occupying grounds on tae Presidio Reser
vation, will be transferred to ihe island.
Some half-forgotten incident- concerning
the location of the hospital on tbe reser
vation may be recalled.
When it was decided to abandon the old
Marine Hospital near the Pacific Mail
Dock?, now used as a Sailors' Home, per
mission was given to locate tbe institution
on a military reservation, provided the
Secretary of the Treasury and tbe Secre
tary of War could agree on a lc cation.
They did agree on the present location at
the bea<i of Lobos Creek on the Presidio
Reservation and this was accepted.
The Government expended $40,000 in
the construction of a building and subse
quently allowed $20,000 for laundry appli
ances and other apparatus.
borne good reasons are said to exist now
for removinu the hospital, and Ange!
Island, where patients could tie trans
ferred from ships in rowboats and con
veyed to tbe hospital wards without being
jolted over the streets of the City, pre
sents many advantages. The island with
out fortifications is not u?efui as a mili
tary station, and the great scheme of
harbor defense does not seem to contem
plate the building of works there.
An examination of the barracks at the
Presidio has been made, and Dy transfer
ring another artillery company to Fort
Mason and enlarging the accommodations
at Benicia it appears that the infantry
companies now stationed at the island can
be properly sheltered. In fact, it is held
tÂ»v the highest military authorities that
the main concentration of troops on this
coatt should be at the Presidio.
It is essential aiso that the water supply
of the Presidio should be ample for any
emergency, and that thy water should be
free from all pollution. The location of
the Marine Hospital at the very source of
the natural water supply of the Presidio is
regarded as a serious drawback. The sub
ject was freely discussed by General R. N.
Batcheider, and Major Davis, the repre
sentative of the Secretary of War, when
these officers recently inspected the mili
tary posts of this department.
The subject is now under consideration
at Washington, and should tbe Secretary
of the Treasury and the Secretary of War
agree the hospital may be moved to Angel
Island, and the troops moved from the
island to the Presidio without Congres
sional legislation. The authority orignally
conferred on these departments to estab
lish the hospital on a military reservation
has not beÂ«n revoked.
The surgeon-general of the Marine Hos
pital service expected to visit San Fran
cisco at the time the quartermaster-gen
eral and the representative of t c Secre
tary of War inspected the posts here, but
when he was about ready to leave Wash
ington the reports of cholera in Cuba made
it necessary for him to remain on the At
lantic seaboard. All the papers Â»nd esti
mates bearing on the proposed transfer of
the Marine Hospital to Angel Island have
been prepared and submitted to him.
General William M. Graham has gone
to Monterey for a few days. Captain Ben
jamin K. Roberts, Fifth Artillery, is com
manding the post.
Lieutenant Oliver E. Wood, Fifth Ar
tillery, has been granted leave of absence
for one month.
Major Charles P. Eaean has been as
signed to duty as chief commissary of sub
sistence of this department.
Captain Oscar F. Long, A. Q. M., has
been assigned to duty as post quarter
master at the Presidio.
Major John A. Darling, Fifth Artillery,
has been granted leave of absence for
eleven days.
First Lieutenant J. F. Reynolds Landis,
First Cava.'ry, has been granted leave of
absence for one month.
One of the most important army retir
ing boards ordered for many years will
convene in Chicago about the middle of
the month. Tho duty of the board will
be to examine for retirement officers from
the rank of colonel to lieutenant. It is
understood that Major General Weiley
Merritt will be the senior officer and chair
man of the board. Brigade General E. S.
Otis, will proDably be seiect d as one of the
officers to serve. An officer with the rank
of colonel will be the third line officer on
the board. Two medical officers of high
rank will also be detailed.
Advices from Washington report that
among the officers who will be ordered to
appear before the board are Colonel R. E.
A. Crofton, Fifteenth Infantry; Lieuten
ant-Colonel J. H. Bradford, Seventeenth
Infantry; Major A. S. B. Keycs, Ttiird
Cavalry; Major J. A. Darline, Fifth Ar
lillery, and Major J. Turnbufl, First Ar
tillery.
Commodore J. A. Howell and Commo
dore George Dewey of the United States
navy have made formal application to
command th* Pacific Squadron. Admiral
Beardsiee's two years on this station will
expire in August. Word came from
Washington that tbe Admiral lias asked
to remain on the Pacific for another year,
but that Secretary Herbert will feel com
pelled to decline the request, as there are
several officers of fla.r rank who have had
no sea service on tiiis line.
SHARKEY AND CHOYNSKY.
They Sparred, but Not Together, for
MiarkÂ«y's Benefit.
The drawing card at the People's Palace
last night was the announcement that Pu
gilists Sharkey and Choynski would spar a
four-round bout. "
This simple announcment had the effect
of filling the building with a paving crowd.
Both pucilists in their respective lines
being favorites their friends were anxious
to show their appreciation of their merits.
â Vetth're was a little disappointment in
the programme, as the two braves did
not face each other, the change being that
Choynski sparred with a light-weight
named Leon Agnew from Illinois. â¢
Of course, tne three rounds' sparring
was chicken play to Choynski, who per
mitted the lightweight to tease him for
the benefit of the audience.
Not so, however, with the tnree rounds
sparred by Sharkey and . Needham, as
Iseedliam kept Corbett's friend in active
motion during the play. Of course, Shar
key kept control ot himself and did > not
deal any of his powerful punches on the
; body of his trainer.
The entertainment last night was in the
shape of a farewell testimonial to Sharkey,
who is going East.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
Summary of Transactions for
the First Half of This
Year.
A GOOD BUILDING RECORD.
Jane a Light Month for Business.
Miscellaneous Notes of
Interest
The record of real estate transactions,
mortgages and releases for the first half of
the present year is not as encouraging as
it might be. It indicates a general dull
ness that seems to increase rather than
diminish. A variety of reasons for exist
ing conditions are given by different brok
ers and dealers. Some regard the cause as
largely local in character and contend that
the present depressed condition of the
market is due mainly to the heavy tax
rate of last year. Others are of the opin
ion that tbe generally disturbed financial
condition of the country is largely respon
sible for a disinclination on the part of the
people, especially capitalists, to invest to
any extent in real estate. In nearly all
the large cities of the country the same
dullness exists to nearly or quite as great
an extent. The tax question does not
obtrude itself so prominently in
hardly any other place as it
does at present here, for last year San Fran
cisco enjoyed the rather unenviable distinction
of havln; nearly or quite the highest tax rate
of any City in the country. This was of course
an additional handicap to the real estate mar
ket that other cities did not have to contend
with, yet elsewhere business generally has
been reported slow Â»il the year. From this it
is fair to assume that the general condition oi
the country is as much if not more responsible
for the prevailing condition of the mÃrketthan
any other one cause, and it will require more
than a decreased tax rate to cause a renewal of
activity in realty transactions.
The story of the mariet for the first half of
1896, as indicated by th records, is told in the

Magee's Real Estate Circular for July con
tains the following timely article:
THE BSWAKD OF WORK.
The City of San Francisco (headed by Claus
Spreckels and sons with a subscription of
$/00,000) raised the total sum of $2,400,000
and the result will be a first-class railroad
from Stockton to Fresno, a distance ttar of 250
miles. The issuance of bonds for $6,000 000
will complete this road to Bakernfield, near
the southern end of the valley, and will rlso
give this City and State a road, by some route
not yet selected, irom Stockton to San Fran
cisco bay. For over twenty years the people
of the City and State have maintained a'news
paper and wordy war against the Southern
Pacific and its varied exactions and over
charges, without accomplishing anything
whatever in the way of redress; but at last the
peopie of this City stopped talking and began
act'.ng.
They raised the sum named and used it in
the construction of a first-class opposition rail
road. The result, alth'>"<rh the line is only
finished to Fresno, is th. 1 1 :e Southern Pacific
has already reduced its t- t â  to a point which
it lately declared before the Railroad Coramis
sioners, if it were torced to adopt, would re
sult in bankruptcy. We call attention to these
facts to show the utter uselessness of com
plaints and talk, and the vital power of money
and work. During the past five years of dull
times every other man, especially the rich
bas made complaints without end. Each one
has talked as though he had a personal greiv
ance against somebody because times were
hard, rents falling and profits low. or actnal
losses taking their place. All such peopie
should be Suppressed hereafter as impudent
nuisances.
No one has a right to constant prosperity
and profit but he who manfully, in and out of
season, works for them. San Francisco, one of
the wealthiest of cities, had been going behind
every way, and she deserved to go behind, for
she allowed the railroad monopoly go to dis
criminate against her that in the conrse of a
few years more there would have been no out
side trade at all left to her. At last she woke
up and the San Joaquin Valley road is the re
sult. Now that enterprise is but the beginning
of the discharge of her duties. A lint- up the
Sacramento Valley, a line of steamships of her
own on the Mexican and Central American
c>a^t must be established, and another to New
York, either by Tehuantepec, Panama or the
Stmits of Magellan. All of those Projects this
City must launch and control. Thus we will
bo discharging our duties to this great State.
When we do so prosperity will come and rents
and real estate will agaiu advance, Mean
time, as we have said, the man of means who
does nothing but complain should be treated
as a nuisance and sharcly suppressed. All he
has, as a rule, he made out of the exertions
and enterprise of others.

BADGES TO BE CHOSEN.
Designs for the Emblem of
the Golden Gate
Carnival.
The Committee Will Meet This
Afternoon and Consider
the Matter.
The time for the reception of the designs
for the badges, stationery and regalia for
the carnival of toe Golden Gate expires
this afternoon at 4 o'clock. A committee,
consisting of Dr. F. W. D'Evelyn, Colonel
O'Byrne and R. P. Doolan, will be at head-
quarters to receive the designs. A num
ber have already been sent in, and from
the class of work submitted the committee
will have a delicate task in selecting the
finest and most appropriate.
All seem to have gotten the carnival
spirit and embodied the idea in connection
with the resources of the Golden State.
The designs submitted already embrace a
large variety of subjects.
Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber
of Commerce, has accepted the invitation
of the executive committee to preside at
the mass meeting to De held on Thursday
afternoon next at 2:30 p. m. at the rooms
of the Chamber of Commerce, in the Mer
chants' Exchange building. General War
field has received assurances from many
of th? prominent business men all over the
City that they would be present and give
the carnival a good start, both morally
and financially. A list of fifty vice-presi
dents is now* being prepared/and will be
announced prior to the meeting.
Special designs for artistic posters for
the carnival have been suggested to the
executive committee. They are very
favorably impressed with those offered*.
and have invited other artists to submit
designs. It is proposed to issue a series of
these posters, sending them all over the
United States to call attention to the
features of the carnival. Poster-collecting
being a fad, it is thought that a small reve
nue, sufficient to pay for their issuance at
least, can be derived from their sale from
those engaged in this delectable pursuit.
There will be no dearth of music at the
carnival if the committee accept only halt
the offers of loreign bands that have been
already tendered. The latest band to ap
ply for a place in the carnival parade is
Rosati's Naval Reserve Band from the
State of New Jersey. The manager writes
from New York to say that the Dand has
been engaged for the Dallas Exposition
for the month of October and thinks it
would be a good Idea if the people of San
Francisco would arrange to nave them
here. Local musicians, however, will have
first choice in all contracts for music.

Berkeley has been a town of remarkably
steady growth. Since tne foundation of
the University of California and the
choice of Berkeley to its site, twenty-seven
years ago, tne pretty town near the hills
of the eastern thore of San Francisco Bay
has enjoyed continuous advancement, and
it is now in the midst of a period of growth
President Martin Kellogg of the Uni
versity of California.
such as certainly very few towns can
match.
The university itself is permanent. It
will last as long as the Republic, and no
possible contingency can retard its growth.
This affords a solid basis for prosperity in
Berkeley, an assurance that the town can
not retrograde, that none of the ordinary
commercial movements which often in
jure a town's prosperity can influence
Berkeley's future. It is a therefore per
lectly safe assertion that real-estate values
in the university town can never retro
grade.
The present population of Berkeley is
about 12,000. The last school census
Principal Warring Wilkinson of the Cal
ifornia Deaf and Dumb Institute.
Bhowed an increase of 9 per cent during
the year just ended.
Building statistics of Berkeley show tbat
the beautiful university town enjoys an
unmatched popularity among home-seek
ers. Through all depression of business
the building trades have remained lively
and the sound of the carpenter's hammer
has been continuously heard in all sec
tions of the town.
During the year 1896 over $326,27") was
expended in building, principally of resi
dences, in Berkeley. About 120 new
houses were erected in the town, some of
them being splendid and costly residences
such as have added materially to the at
tractiveness of its streets.
Berkeleyans confidently predict a con
tinuation of the growth of the past. They
leview the town's history and see thaf
from the beginning it has gone forward
without pause under the influence of
natural advantages that time has only im
proved and of added charms in the way oi
social allurements and educational and
literary leadership such as every year ire
made more and more prominent. The
natural advantages are of climate, situa
tion and scenic attractions. As far as
J. \> . Kichards, President or tne uoara
of Town Trustees.
climate is concerned the town can claim
for itself all the strongest I, oasts that have
made the name California a byword for
climatic perfection throughout the^world.
It speaks volumes forth: healtbfulness
of the town that the only "epidemic" her
Health Officer has to discuss is one of
measles.
Of the 114 deaths that occurred in Berke
ley during the year ending May 14. 1896,
twenty-hve were Coroner's cases, and in
no way attributable to climatic or other
odinary causes. This means that the
Morning Scene at Such & Nelson's Extensive Dairy Farm in the Berkeley Hills.
town may legitimately claim better than
the remarkable death rate of 10V4 ncr
thousand. '- v
i The work of sewering in Berkeley is
about completed, nearly all parts of the
| town that need sewers being provided with
them. There are 59.18 m lies of sewer in
the town, constructed at a cost of $Â°Â°0 000
which is about $19 60 per capita.
One of the most beautiful sections of th c
town is that known as the Scenic Tract
which is situated just north of the Uni
versity grounds. The Scenic Tract has
natural advantages of situation that makes
it especially attractive, and added to these
are beauties of cultivation and architect
ure. Some of the tinest residences in
Berkeley are in this tract and their gar
dens are elaborately laid out aud carefully
cultivated.
The Scenic Tract's advantages of situa
tion are its slight elevation, wnich affords a
magnificent view of the bay, San Fran
cisco and the Golden Gate, as well as of
other parts of Berkeley.
Prominent among the several indus
tries located in West Berkeley is the starch
factory of J. Everding <k Co. "it is the only
starch factory of ttie kind on the Pacific
CoaÃt and has been running for over
twenty years. Several other starch fac
tories have been started frdm time to time
in the State, but none have run for any
considerable time. In the other factories
I potatoes and corn were used in the manu
facture, while in tne factory of Everding
& Co. cereals are used almost exclusively.
West Berkeley awaits with anxiety the

day when a wharf is constructed on its
shores, allowing the decking of deep
water vessels. Such a wharf will be one of
the enterprises of the near future, and it
will be followed by a direct ferry system
between Berkeley and San Francisco. The
wharf will give an incalculable impetus to
West Berkeley's manufacturing interests.
A new, complicated and immensely val
uable addition to Berkeley's measures of
government is a system of sanitary laws
by which the whole town in a single year
has been brought up to a remarkable
standard of sanitary perfection. Every
i house has been inspected and every case
! of defective plumbing in the town has
! been corrected.
Berkeley is singularly free from the un
desirable element of population. Her
criminal courts are almost useless, except
in the deterrent influence wielded by the
mere existence of such a necessary institu
tion of modern life.
The whole east end of the town, even
beyond the "mile limit,'' Ls without a sa

Berkeley have naturally been such as were
attracted by the absence of the liquor

Education.
ment even in places where there is no law
to suppress it.
The Berkeley High School it second to
none in California. It is always under the
wing of the great university and constantly
feels its influence. Its corps of teachers
is necessarily up to the very highest
standard, for every year the State Univer
sity turns out the very highest talent in
the art of teaching and from its graduates
are selected teachers for Berkeley's
schools.
in the Berkeley High School there were
330 students last year. The school has a
corps of ten teachers, each of which has a
university degree. Special courses in
French and German are given.
The principal of the hlch school and of
the grammar schools of East Berkeley is
H. D. Waterman. Mr. W T aterman is a
teacher of long experience and his record
is the proof of his efficiency. Under his
management the high school of Berkeley
has made an advance in recent years that
is not less than remarkable.
Three years ago the whole enrollment
of the high school was only seventy-two â
equal to the number of graduates from
the school this year.
The wish to live beneath the shadow of
a great university, the appreciation of the
atmosphere such an institution gives to a
community and the desire to enjoy the
specially stringent suppression of the un
desiraDle features of ciiy life by which the
State Legislature protected students of the
university from the saloon and its prod-

ucts, combine to cause Berkeley to be
come a center of attraction for the cul
tured and high-minded people of the State.
The corps of scientists of the University
of California is in touch with the leaders
of the world, and numbers among its
bright liehts men who are known wher
ever modern science is revered. The ven
erable Dr. Joseph Le Conte of Berkeley,
specialist in biology and geology, is now
in the East, accepting the invitation of
leading scientific associations of the* world
to address them, among them the Amer
ican and the British National Associa
tions for the Advancement of Science.
Berkeley has an interesting and impor
tant institution in the State School for the
Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. The insti
tution is situated close under the hills of
â hast Berkeley. Its buildings are large
and costly, and on a clear day are visible
irom any part of the town and from the
deck of a bay ferry-boat. There are eleven
puildings in all. affording accommodations
'or over 200 pupils every term.
. A ne institution has been established
since 1860. It das been in charge of its
present principal, Dr. Warring Wilkinson,
sincÃlSto. Prior to his engagement as
principal of thÂ© State institution of Cali
fornia Dr. Wilkinson was for eight years
a teacher in the Institution for the' Deaf
and Dumb at New York City.
-The Berkeley institution is declared by
ail visitors to be a model of its kind The
big, quiet buildings form a little world by
themselves, and there is an orderliness
and cleanliness about them and their
grounds that cannot fail to favorably im
press those who view them.
The water supply of Berkeley is from the
hills to the east of the town. It is fur
nished by the Alameda Water Company,
which has three large reservoirs rilled from
tunnels on Wildcat Creet. Within the
past month a valuable addition to the
company's supply of water has been se
cured in the development of two new
c^ n ells E ivin * a steady flow of nearly
-00,000 gallons per day.
The water, lite that in the reservoirs, is
clear and pure. Berkeley's health record
is sufficient proof of the purity of her
water supply, for no town can be healthful
whose residents are not furnished with
good water.
The Alameda Water Company has
placed four hundred feet of new tunnel in
VV Hdcat Canyon during the past year. It
has enlarged the Berryman reservoir and
newly cemented the big summit reservoir,
and has laid new mains In many streets of
Berkeley.
One of the Attractive Residences of Berkeley Belonging to J. L. Barker.
Boring for water is still being continued
by the company. A large sum of money has
already been expended in the search for
additional wells, but the company still
continnes and the recent strike of artesian
water shows that it is right :n so doing.
The company here manifests an enter
prising disposition to keep ahead of the
progress of the town, and always be ahead
of the demand for water, no matter how
large the demand may be.
The Berkeley Electric Lighting Com
pany is one of the largest business firms in
the town, and one whose presence in
Berkeley is and has been of most im
portance to the progress of the com
munity.
The company has just completed plans
for securing current for its lights from the
power-house of the Oakland Gas Light and
Heat Company, an arrangement by
which the Berkeley company will be ena
bled to furnish lights to the town for 50
cents each less than hitherto, and by rea
son of the saving of expenses of conduct
ing a private plant in Berkeley will be
able to expend larger sums upon the ex
tension of the lighting system in the Uni
versity town.
Another important advantage of the new
arrangement will be tbat current can be
furnished continuously day ami night and
there will never be danger of a break down.
A break down of one engine c*rh be imme
diately remedied in the Oakland plant by
use of another, so that there will never be
an interim of darkness as has sometimes
been the case in the past.
The work of connecting the Oakland
power-house with the Berkeley lighting
system will be begun in thirty days and
will be completed in two months. The
iine will be brought through Golden Gate,
Lorin and Temescal, so as to provide all
territory between Berkeley and Oakland
with lights.
An institution which has been the means
of adding 500 homes to Berkeley can cer
tainly claim to have been a powerful in
fluence in aid of the town's growth. The
Homestead Loan Association has built
more than 500 residences for Berkeleyans
during the past ten years.
Berkeley, as a residence town and an
educational center, depends for its prog
ress upon its attractiveness to homeseek
ers. hence it would be difficult to over
estimate the value to the town of an or
ganization which, like the association re
ferred to, assists in the building of resi
dences.
The Homestead Loan Association was
incorporated March 3, 1886, with an
authorized capital of $1,000,000. It was
prosperous from the first and has grown
until to-day its assets are over a quarter of
a million dollars; it has loans outstand
ing secured by Berkeley real estate
amounting to over $240,000, and as already I
stated there are 500 homes in Berkeley I
that were built by its agency.
During the year just ended the loan j
association has matured two aeries of '
stock, after a serial duration of a little over
nine years, paying about $25,000 to hold
era of the matured shares, and netting for
the owners an interest of from 13 to 14 per
cent per annum.
The stated objects of the association are
as follows:
First â To furnish a convenient, safe and
profitable method of investing the savings
of the working people.
Secondâ To furnish persons who wish to
borrow money for any purpose whatever
the means of doing so at a reasonable rate
of interest. In other words, it is an asso
ciation composed of borrowers and lenders
and established for their mutual conve
nience. It gathers together the savings of
the people, which, scattered and in small
sums, could not he invested to advantage,
and loans the money thus obtained, on
mortgage security and in sums to suit, to
other people who want it to build them
: selves nomes. to pay off other mortgages,
to invest in business, or for any other pur
pose.
In pursuance of these objects the associ
ation, which is a sort of co-operative Hav
ings bank, has succeeded in building up a
reputation tbat will prove of inestimable
value to its management in the future. As
j an indication of the institution's stability
and proof that it has the confidence of in-
I vestors, the fact that some of its first
i stockholders are still enrolled upon its
| books is significant.
The president of the Homestead Asso
ciation, M. If. Rhorer, Deputy State In
surance Commissioner of California, has
| been at the head of the association since
its incorporation. He and the other offi
cers and directors have served withontany
compensation for the whole ten years of
th<* association's existence.
The resent opening of "Bath Beach" at
West Berkeley isa'i event that promises to
result in much benefit to the town in gen-
J eral. Citizens of Berkeley have long dis
: cussed the feasibility of establishing a sea
bathing resort on the beach at the West
End, and the enterprise of those who have
constructed bathhouses at Bath Beach is
a move that is popular with all classes, for
| the whole town would derive benefit from
I the influx of visitors, which it is hoped
I will one day be the rule when the attrac
i tions of Ba!h Beach become generally
known.
Miss Head's school for girls on Charming
way has just closed its eighth year with a
larger attendance than ever before, the
graduating class numbering ten. The
school has seemed to supply a long-felt
want in Berkeley, giving a sound and
thorough mental training from the
primary grade till the graduate is prepared
for college, together with a healthy physi
cal development aiid cheerful family fife.
The large and well equipped gymnasium
is under the charge of the instructor in
athletics at the State University, and the
girls enjoy their games of basket-ball and
tennis and their walks about Berkeley.
The building, which is a large one con
structed according to the latest and most
approved system of architecture and in
keeping with the best system of sanita
tion, stands on the upland and commands
a beautiful view of Berkeley and the bay.
The school has always been abreast
of the newest and rr.oit useful ideas in
education and is quick to adopt the best
books and the best methods. Many pupils
of the institution come every day from
Oakland, San Francisco and Fruitvale, as
well as the children of a large number of
the professors and other prominent citi
zens of Berkeley.
Martin KeJlogg, A.M., A.8., LL.D.,

F. K. Shattuck, one of the pioneer set
tlors in the university town, is known
throughout all Berkeley and Oairland as a
leading capitalist and real estate dealer
and in the college town, where he resides,
Mr. Shattuck has a reputation for public
spirit such as can only be won by a long
life full of examples of local patriotism.
A recent instance is Mr. Shnttuck's offer
ol land in Berkeley worth $10,000 as an in
ducement to the regents of the University
to locate the Wilmerding School io ihe
town.
Mr. Shattuck is the owner of the Shat
tuck block.containing Shattuck Hall, where
the principal meetings, lectures and enter
tainments of Berkeley are heid and a
number of stores and offices, the largest
being the Berkeley Bazaar of H. R. So
rensen.
The store of Mr, Sorensen is the only
glassware and crockery establishment in
the place, he having been located in the
college town for the past fear years.
P. R. Boone, president of the Board of
Threi of the I rincipal Buildings of the University of California.
Education of Berkeley, is one of the town's
old residents. Mr. Boone was one of the
first voters when the town incorporated in
1878. He was one of the' founders of the
Berkeley Gymnasium, and in 1881 estab
lished Boorie's University School, of which
he is at present owner and principal.
Boone's school is a high-class preparatory
institution, select and limited, the num
ber of scholars being about forty-five. It
has prepared for the State University from
125 to 150 students. President Bobne is
known as one of the most progressive citi
zens of Berkeley. .
J. W. Richards is the president of the
Board of Trustees of Berkeley. Mr. Rich
ards' term of office began about one year
a co and since that time the ousiness of
the town has been conducted in a sys
tematic, expeditious way tbat bespeaks
for Mr. Richards, as the official whose lot
it is to bear the brunt of the not very light
burden of public needs and business, a
splendid business capacity and a deep,
patriotic interest in public matters.
J. L. Barker of the lumber firm of
Barker & Hunter is a citizen who has had
much to do with the town's development.
Mr. Barker's firm has built about 150 resi
dences in Berkeley which sold for from
$1200 to $5000 each. The advent of the
railroad to the university town was
brought about to a considerable extent by
the efforts of Mr. Barker, who id a large
holder of Berkeley real estate and has
shown the strongest confidence in the
town's future.
Among the residences recently built by
Mr. Barker is the one of which a view is
herewith presented. It is a bouse of
seven rooms, new and modern in all re
spects, occupying a lot 44^x135, which is
for sale for $4000, $500 cash and the balance
at $35 or $40 per month.
The house is situated near Berryman
station and from its windows one may ob
tain a magnificent view of the bay and the
Golden Gate, and eastward of the hills of
Berkeley. Mr. Barker also holds for sale
a- large number of other buildings equally
as well constructed and equally as well
situated.
Wiiliam Carey Jones, professor of juris
prudence in the University and one of the
public-spirited citizens of the town, hav
ing served in the capacity of president of
J. J. Dnnn, Proprietor of the Dunn
Basalt Rock Quarry.
the Board of Education, president of the
Freeholders, and trustee from the Second
Ward, has the standard and only history
of Berkeley and of the University. His
"Illustrated History of the University of
California," which has received tho most
flattering critltism from the press and
prominent educators throughout the
country, gives the earliest his lory of
Berkeley and describes its present charac
teristics. It contains a complete historical
account of the founding, rise and expan
sion of the University to its present plane
of fellowship with the greater institutions
of the United States.
Among the prominent citizens of Berke
ley few are better known {than Walter E.
Sell, who has been a resident of the town
since 1877 and who has taken a leading
part in many enterprises of general inter
est to Berkeleyans.
Mr. Sell has been vice-president of the
Homestead Loan Association of Berkeley
since its organization in 1836, and since
George Schmidt, One of Berkeley's Lead
ing Keal Estate Dealers.
the establishment of the Commercial Bank
of Berkeley has been one of the directors
of that institution.
He is also at the head of the Claremont,
University and Ferries Railroad Com
pany, which has a street-car line between
East and West Berkeley. The line is at
present one of horsecars, but preparations
are already under way for the introduc
tion on the cars of new motors, which
furnished with power by compressed air
and electricity will give the same speed as
the regular trolley system of electric-cars.
Mr. Sell's company owns a franchise for
a street railway that will some day give
Berkeley another connection with Oak
land.
The franchise extends from the termi
nus of the present road down Shattuck
avenue to Bancroft way, thence to College
avenue and along the latter to the south
boundary of the town.
Erobably the most prominent contractor
and builder in thecollege town is Frederick
Esty, who has constructed nearly as many
houses in the college town as all the other
contractors now in business here com
bined. At the present time he has seven
houses in process of construction, several
of which are to cost upwards of $5000.
There are included in the n nmber of houses
he has built some of the finest homes in
Berkeley. Mr. Esty is both an architect
as well as a contractor.
Among the houses which he has built
this year, some of which are now in pro
cess of construction, are those of Mrs.
Alice Edward?, on Haste street; Mrs.
Mary Colt, on Haste street: Mrs. Mary E.
Alexander, on Bowditch street; Arthur
Young, at the corner of Euclid avenue and
Le Conte street; Mrs. Rose Chappie, on
Dana street; William Kelley, on Ellsworth
and Bancroft; Mrs. F. Farley, on Choate
and Charming; L. E. Hunt, on Ridge
road; H.W.Allen, on Snattuck avenue,
and W. W. Clark, in the Daly Scenic
Tract, besides completing many smaller
contracts.
George Schmidt is one of the progressive
and influential landowners and real estate
dealers of the town, and is also one of its
most active business men.
Mr. Schmidt has recently opened for
sale a tract of land in the West End
known as Schmidts village. The land
Shittuck Block, Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley.
has been divided into residence lots,
which are rapidly being sold to home
seekers.
Schmidt's village is situated near the
water front of West Berkeley. It is with
in a twenty-five minutes' drive of the State
University and is reached by splendid
roads on which a bicycle rider may with
out exertion reach the central part of the
town or the High School in fifteen minutes.
Homes in Schmidt's village thus possess
all the advantages that Berkeleyans boast
of â the climate and Bcenery and the edu
cational opportunities â and the lots into
which the Schmidt tract has been divided
are offered on such easy terms that the
sale is rapid and the near future promises
to see the entire tract taken up by resi
dence builders.
The real-estate firm of O. G. May & Co.,
2123 Center street, is one of the most re
liable and enterprising in Berkeley. This
spring they have sold twenty lots, ranging
in price from $1775 down to $100. They
have rented about as many dwellings at
from $50 down to $8, besides building two
houses, placing considerable insurance
and loans and Belling some outside prop
erty. They always have a great variety of
property for sale and for rent, which they
are glad to show to all interested. Just
now they are offering several fine lots and
two or three houses at amazingly low
prices and easy terms.
Joseph J. Mason is one of Berkeley's
leading real-estate dealers. His office is
on the west side of Shattuck avenue, near
the corner of Center street. Mr. Mason
transacts a general real estate and in
surance business, in which line he is one
of the successful men of the town.
J. J. Dunn, the well-known street con
tractor and owner of the Dunn basalt rock
quarry, has been a prominent citizen of
the town for many years, and has been an
important figure in bringing the town
to the position it now holds. Besides own
ing the extensive rock quarry, he is a
large land holder, having realty of more
or less value scattered throughout the
town.
The photographic art work for this edi
tion on Berkeley was done by George
Wilcox, senior member of the Wil
cox Photographing Company. Their
large establishment, which is located at
J. L. Barker, One of Berkeley's Most
Progressive Citizens.
the corner of Shattuck avenue and Center
street, is equipped with all the latest and
most approved appliances for doing high
grade work.
That Berkeley will progress on and on
in a rapid and healthy growth there seems
to be r.o reason for doubt, not only from
the fact that it possesses so many physi
cal advantages, but also from the reason
that it is the site of the State's great uni
versity, which, according to the principles
of its foundation, will continua in per
petuity.

Installations .re the order of the evenings In the
various courts at this time.
Last Thursday evening Court Lincoln Installed
its officers, those whose names have already been
given in this department, and gave its first smoker
In Social. Hall. Alcazar building. There was a
large number present, and during the evening the
number was augmented by the visit in a body of
Court Vlctolre. There were also present quite a
number of the friends of the members of toe new
court, for it was an open meeting. There were
present among the visitors Past Chief Ranger Wil
liam l ashman. High Court Treasurer Lunt and
District Deputy M. P. Light, who was the Installing
officer. The programme for the evening opened
with a brief talk on the objects of the order for the
benefit of the strangers by the district deputy.
He told of the fraternal portion of the order, of
its beneficiary features and spoke of the social re
unions which serve I to make a pleasant feature of
it. This was followed by a song by Mr. Inchcliffe,
Mr. Nolan being the accompanist. After that
there was a recitation and then a song by Thomas
Kodgers. Then followed the ceremony of install
ing the officers, â¢vhich was performed in a very
impressive manner. When the officers bad been

ALL READY FOR TUESDAY
The Hobart-Baldwin Marriage
in the Church at San
Mateo.
Elegant Simplicity to Characterize
This Notable Event in Social
Circles.
Elegant simplicity is to be the keynote
of the Btildwin-Hobart wedding on Tues
day. Like the wedding of Walter Hobart
and Miss Williams, this is to be a country
wedding â simple and unostentatious, al
though Miss Hobart has made rather more
elaborate preparation for her marriage.
It is to be celebrated at tne little church at
San Mateo, and Bishop Nichols is to unite
the fortunate young couple.
Several hundred invitations for the
church ceremony have been issued, and it
has been arranged for a special train to
convey the guests to San Mateo on Tues
day morning. The train will leave Third
and Townsend streets at 11:15. Theguents
will be met on tneir arrival at the village
by carriages and driven to St. Matliew's
Church.
The decorations at the church are to be
all in white. Tnere is to be no relieving
color. It is to be a white wedding. The
flowers for the altar are to be all snowy
white. The bridesmaids â Miss Florence
Mills, Miss Juliette Williams, Miss Mary
Eyre and Miss Jessie Hobart â are to be attired
all alike in pure white â white orgnnaie over
white silk â and the bride's gown, oi course, Is
to be all white.
The gown Miss Hobart will wear when she
becomes the bride of Charles A. Baldwin is of
cream-white salin, trimmed with some rare
Valenciennes. Like the gowns of her brides
maids, it was made by a leading New York
couturiere.
A breakfast will follow the ceremony, and,
although invitations have been limited, covers
will be laid for 200.
The wedding of Miss Alice Gerstle and J.
Levinson |\vill be celebrated on Wednesday,
July 29, at the elegant Gerstle place at San
Kniael. It is to be a noon wedding, and is to
be followed by a dejeuner to be served on the
lawn. Many delightiul novelties will be intro
duced, not the least of which will be the elabo
rate display of fireworks in the evening.

Edward Kelly and John Martinson held
a great celebration at midnight in honor
The Inside of the Escape's Cell When a Deputy Entered It Yesterday Morning.
The Man in the Picture Is of the Same Build as Kelly and Shows How
Difficult Must Have Been the Task of Getting Through the Hole.
of gaining their civil liberty. Just where
they celebrated or the hour is not known,
but it was before the hour of midnight,
when the noise of the firecrackers was
loudest. '
KelJy and Martinson were prisoners in
the County Jail yesterday afternoon. To
day they are where nobody can find them.
Tney cut their way out of their cell,
lowered thenfcelves into the courtyard,
and, with the aid of confederates, escaped
over the wall to liberty. Both tde men
are olri-timers and are known all over the
State as burglars.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Martinson vis
ited her husband and talked with him
through the wicket of his cell. She ap
peared to be more distressed than ever,
and her devotion to her husband was par
ticularly noticeable.
What transpired after Mrs. Martinson
departed is told partly by tbe third occu
pant and partly by the evidence of tbe
flight
â¢'After the woman went," said Frank
Wood, who wa* a cellmate of the escapes,
"they cave me some opium, and as I had
not taten any for a long time I took ?n
extra big dose and very soon I kii ..â¢
nothing. When I woke up I was the only
one left in the cell. I don't know when
they went, but it was about midnight
when I woke and they were gone. They
had pulled tne blankets from under me
to make a roje."
The bars of the window, which are of
soft iron, were cut through with remark
able cleanness, showing that the burglars
must have had some first-class tools.
Outside (he window are three heavy up
right bars and one of these was sawed
through and lifted inside the cell. The
blankets were torn into strips and twisted
into a rope, and with these the men
lowered themselves to the ground. Con
federates must have been in waiting to
help them over the outer wall. A pillow
slip on the end of a string was found in
the room and it is .supposed that after the
hole was cut through the window a line
was thrown clear over tlie outside wall
and ths bag containing a rope ladder was
hauled into the cell.
It le quite certain that Mrs. Martinson
supplied the connecting links of the con
s-piracy during her visit yesterday and
landed her husband the saws with which
the bars were cut. Indeed, there are
seven cuts through bars over one inch
thick.
The men were evidently experts at get
ting through small holes, as an amateur
could not possibly get through the aper
ture. The hole in the window is broad
but of little height, while the outer hole,
between the upright bars, is narrow but
long. This necessitates a man taking a
half-turn in himself while passing through,
and this at a beitrht of twenty feet from
the ground is attended with great risk.
The prisoners' freedom, however, was
very brief. Deputy Sheriff Al White lo
< 't ri Mrs. Murunson this afternoon and
followed her. tihe led him to n house in
San Francisco aud both escapes w*re there.
V>'ith the assistance of an officer Ai White
handcuffed the two men and to-nii.'ht they
are back in the County Jail, having been
absent but twenty hours.

FIREWORKS AND ORATORY
They Should Not Be Mistaken
and Substituted for
Patriotism.
Timely 'Discourse by the Pastor of
the First Free Baptist
Church.
Oakland Office San Fbancifco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 5. J
To-night Rev. Philip Graif, at the Twen
ty-rirst street Free Baptist Church,
preached on a Fourth of July theme, tak
ing "Patriotism" as the baais of his ser
mon. He said:
Anniversaries of public noise and pomp of
j pnriKl*,', of firecracker and oration, of sky-
I rocket and rit?s of holy memorial, are not
without their ethical significance and imprcs
siveness. Little do we think that la the an.
nual rage for fireworks and eloquence and
i singing ol National hymns there is a divine
| contagion in wh.ch a red-blooded patriotism is
I bredâ and yet, to some extent such is the fact.
How commemorative days stir the National
c<ii>cience and fire the patriot heart, and
i happy is that lnud whose roll of worthies is
loi;g. and whose deeds of valor electrify and
I dazzle cot and palace, plow and classic hail
alike.
Not to erect statue or marble shaft to states-
I men and sages, heroes and martyrs; not to
i ceiebrate their virtues or exult In their. vie-
I torie-< is not only to undervalue our priceless
! heritage, but to quench or mar the patriotism
' of the future. Tc leave Bunker Hill or Gettys
burg unsung in the battle hymns of the Re
public, or to leave the brow of a Washington
or a Lincoln uncircled with the halo of our
! admiration and love were base ingratitude.
I Let each new Fourth be like Walter Scott's
! fieure of Old Mortality, with clean-cut chisel,
i searching the nobie tombstones of our history
I and bringing out in beautiful distinctness
names almost effaced by creeping moss or the
decaying tooth of time.
Let our patriotism be a vital, inspirational
forceâ not a cold, mechanical, calculating af
fair. ' Juat as Homer lived for poetry and Ra
phael was devoted to painting, so a patriot 1b
eonsumned and exalted by his love fort lie starry
flae. It is quite possible that a sordid, money
mukinK age may cool the loftier ardor of affec
tion for the fatherland, for it is said that no
divine art or stroke of heroism will flow forth,
I whether in carving or music or goodness, from
'< ringers' thin itch too loudly after gold. After
all, not in anything else but in unselfish Living
for others Is the secret found of the country's
growing hupuino.-s Had splendor, and hence to
promote a government by, oi and for the peo
ple is not only the best way of commemorating
the illustruous pa-4, but also the wisest method
of enlarging and glorifying the future of our
country.

PATRIOTISM AND MURDER.
The City Ordinance Opens a Way by
Which the Two May B;
Blended.
Oakland Office Sah Fbancibco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 5. j
There is a Good Roads Association in
this city, the puipoee of which is suffi
ciently Indicated by its name. There is
also a Good Government Club, whose pur
pose should also be sufficieutlv expressed
by its designation. It mi.ht also be sup
posed, and not unreasonably, that the
lines of work of the two clubs would be
Bomewhat similar. A greater error could
not possibly be made, and to add to the
intricacy of the situation there are a few
prominent men who are connected with
both associations. Anywhere else but in
Oakland this state of affairs would be re
garded as somewhat peculiar. Here it ex
cites no comment, as the system of play
ing both ends against the middle has long
been regarded as one of the fine arts most
worthy of patronage.
During tbe past week the fiscal year has
closed, during which the tax rate has
been one dollar. A meeting of the Mer
chants' Exchange was also held which
recommended that a tax rate be levied for
the coming year which shall be sufficient
to provide for all necessary repairs and for
half the reconstruction of the main thor
oughfares to East Oakland. Thisresolu
tion was passed and indorsed by the Good
Roads Association after an elaborate
paper by M. K. Miller, the present Street
Superintendent.
iir. Miller's plan provides for half the
reconstruction of some streets of which
the property-owners are to provide the
other half. Of course, if Mr. Miller were
to be permitted to continue in office till
his plans were completed il would be a
good idea to accept them, but it is likely
that another Populist Board of Works
will be elected, and ia such a case Mr.
Miller would be retired and his successor
would have other plans.
Undoubtedly the Good Roads Associa
tion, tbe Merchants' Exchange and the
Board of Works are thoroughly sincere
in their desire for a tax rate sufficiently
high to provide good roads. This, how
ever, cannot be undertaken on a dollar
tax, if Mr. Miller's report of his past year's
work be correct. Mayor Davie, the great
champion of the dollar tax, says that lack
of money is not the cause of so many
streets being out of repair, but lack of
competency. Between these statements
the public must choose.
The Good Government Club is the great
moral power behind tbe Mayor in bis
fight to maintain a dollar tax. During the
past year it has been conclusively proved
that a dollar can pay all running expenses,
but even its most enthusiastic supporter
will not claim that it allows for any per
manent improvements. Here, then, is
where the friction arises. Is the Good
Government Club in its support of the low
tax rate contributing to the possibility of
permanently improving the roads? It is
certain that money is required to make
good roads, and it is equally certain that
ii people who as good citizens demand
good roads are not equally willing as good
taxpayers to countenance the necessary
tax, nothing will bedone and the meetines
of improvement clubs had better never
have been called. If a tax ot $1 15 is
absolutely necessary to provide for good
roads â and men whose business it is to
know say that it is â then the Good Gov
ernment Club and the Mayor should
countenance it and lend their aid in estab
lishing it at that figure. If the roads can
be repaired on tbe dollar taxâ anc the
Mayor declares that they can â then the
statements of the Street Superintendent
should be disproved. In referring to the
Oakland dollar tax levy there is one thing
to be borne in mind. The dollar provides
for municipal expenses as well as for bond
interest and redemption. These latter
require a tax of 13 cents, so that the city's
municipal tax is in reality but 85 cents.
It will be on the tax question mat the
next municipal campaign will be fought.
There is immediate need for an amend
ment of the ordinance permitting the
firing of blank cartridges in the streets on
the Fourth of July. The ordinance was
grossly violated, and one young lady may
congratulate herself that she is still alive,
although her features will be marked for
life. Broadway this morning was a revela
tion to the police officers and citizens who
inspected it. Scores of bullets were in the
sidewalks and many signs were liberally
punctured. No other proof was necessary
that a large proportion of the "blank' 1
cartridges used yesterday were loaded. At
the Sixth-street engine-house a man was
seen to discharge his revolver in the air
and a fatality was narrowly averted. The
shooting of Miss Ellis should be argument
enough to immediately bring about a
change in the ordinance. No argument
can make possible murders an excuse for
a display of patriotism.
So long as people are permitted to fire
blank cartridges on the streets the privi
lege, if such it can be called, will be
abused. The size to whicli fire-crackers
have grown are surely big enough and
noisy enough to express the patriotism of
even a naturalized Britisher, without re
course to a practice that is bound eventu
ally to provft fatal.
Toward the close of the National holi
day when the exuberance of spirits begins
to assert itself, a revolver with any kind of
cartridges is dangerous. Where a crowd
of young fellows are shooting on the
streets it is impossible to tell which one is
using bullets or to trace the culpability in
case of accident. The number of bullets
on the street to-day shows Low greatly
the privilege was violated and should be
all tbe petition necessary to secure a
remedy.
Editor Hign nas played in bad luck. He
was found guilty oi criminal libel by a
jury in the Police Court. Although legally
guilty. Mr. High can hardly be said to be
morally so. Although an Oaklander, Mr.
High's newspaper experience was mostly
gained in Han Francisco and Los Angeles.
It was this that led him astray. Mr. High
naturally concluded that the residents of
this city were like those of the northern
and southern metropolises and paid no at
tention to newspaper statements. Here it
is different. The value of a reputation is
placed at a very high figure in Oakland
and when it is assailed all stand in for
mutual protection. Mr. High thought he
had libeled only Mr. Dingee. He discov
ered that he had, in reality, libeled the
whole city and he has been engrossed in
deep thouarht ever since. s. W. B.

Yesterday afternoon the Sunday-school
service in the Sunday-school room of the
Simpson Memorial Church was of the pa

one it was. The schoolroom was taste
fully decorated with flags and patriotic
emblems.
After the usual opening exercises, C. B.
Perkins, the superintendent, delivered a
short patriotic address, drawing a iesson
from the celebration of the Fourth. Tbe
children sang "The Ked, White ana Blue,"

RICH IN CHRYSOPRASE.
Professor Kunz Says That the
Tulare Discovery Is
Valuable.
This Exp rt Mineralogist Denies That
He M nimized the Importance
of the Find.
Botne time ago there was published in
The Call an account of the discovery of
chrysoprase in Visaiia, and t&e fact that
the rind was a valuable one in view of its
scarcity. On the following day there was
published a dispatch from New York
which set forth that Professor Georee F.
Kunz, one of the beat known mineralo
gists of the ace, had declared that the find
was of no value.
A few dayÃ ago 0. P. "Wilcomb, the
curator of Golden Gate Park museum, re
ceived a letter from M. Braverman of Vi
salia, who owns the ground in which the
ems were found.. In this the writer says '
that he received a communication from I
Professor Kunz, who informed him that j
tiiere must have been soaae mistake in the j
dispatch.
He says that he did not have any talk
with any one on the subject, and conse
quently could not have said what was cred
ited to him; that he further drew atten
tion on the subject in bis book, "The Pre
cious Stones ot the United States." What
he has published is brief and is in the
following words: "There arp specimens of
chrysoprase found near Visalia by M.
liraverrnan. They are perfect gems.'"'
Accompanying this letter to Mr. Wil
comb wag a clipping from a recent issue of
the Daily Delta, published in Vis&lia, reia
tive to the district from which the gems
have been obtained. In this article the
writer says;
The chrysopraee rninps are located nine
miles northeast of Visaiia. When specimens
were llrst brought here the discoverer thought
he had found indications of riuc, but Mr.
Kraverman had the specimens tested and wai
the first to make known the existence of the
beautiful stone in this vicinity. The first
specimens were found on the western slope of
the small detached clump of hills near the old
p< ttlemrnt oi Venice. Subsequently tine speci
mens were found ou the eastern Blope.
Tulare County is the only portion of the
United States in which it has been discovered,
and at the mine the prized frem was iound In
tiiin layers in silicified serpentine rock which
is hard and difficuU to work. The veins of
chryKoprase nre generally from half an inch
to two inches thick.
The result of two weeks' work was only
eight or ten ounces of the gem material. Most
of what was dug out was pitted or contained
flaws and tbe shade of most of it was a very
liÃht green. It is the uncertainty and extreme
difficulty of getting suitable stone that makes
it valuable.
The writer then describes the finding of
some semi-opals, and adds: "The locality
is an interesting one to scientists. The
entire hill shows the existence of chal
cedony. Proper investigation may de
velop something of value in this remark
able group of hills nestling at the base of
the (Sierras. Owini; to the warm weather
and the exposed condition of tne diggings
work at the chryaoprase mines has been
discontinued, but will De resumed in the
fall by Professor Smith, who has recently
been conducting it."
â¢â¢Tulare County," said Mr. Wilcomb, "is
a remarkable country â one that is full of
interest for the mineralogist, and as the
surface of the hills has been only ex
amined there is no telling what will be
discovered when search it> made below the
surface. I am of the opinion that it is
, much richer than peopie nave any idea."

there were but few children the matter re
ceived but little notice. Now, however,
the territory is rapidly becoming settled,
and the district voted bonds to erect a
schoolhouse that should be adequate to
the needs of the territory for many years
to come.
During the past few years the Bella
Vista district has increased greatly in
population. For more than two years
there has been a standing complaint
against the lack of school facilities, but
nothing could be done until the taxpayers
dec ded to issue bonds. This was done a
few weeks ago and they are being eagerly
sought for by bond-buyer 3.
The plans provide for a pretty little
building of four classrooms. It ia rather
more ornamental than the usual type of
country school and will be located about,
midway between Niles and Decoto. It is
calculated that it will open with an at
tendance of about 100.
For the past year the majority of the
children who will attend the new school
have been attending the public schools at
Hay wards, but the schools of that place
are now overcrowded and relief was per
emptory.
Tnere is a feeling of great satisfaction in
the Bella Vista district over the establish
ment of the new school, and it will doubt
| less act as an additional incentive to at
! tract residents to the productive neighbor
! hood. During the past few years the num
ber of school children in the interior of the
county has largely increased, and several
districts will soon have to vote bonds for
additional accommodations.
Livermore has recently added greatly to
her school facilities and other towns are
j about to follow suit.

Funeral of E* E. "White.
BERKELEY, Cal., July s.â The funeral
of L. E. White, the "Lumber King," who
died at Cazadero last Wednesday, took
place from the family residence on Ward
street this afternoon at 2 o'clock. Rector
George E. Swan of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church preached the funeral sermon, and
a quartet consisting of William N. Harris,
Frederick Clark, Miss Alice Raymond ana
Miss Gertrude Moore furnished music. At
the house they sang "Rock of Ages" and
"Jesus, Lover of My Soul," and at tbe
grave, "Abide With Me."
The house was filled with friends of the
deceased, who had come to pay their last
tribute to one of the State's prominent
citizens and public benefactors. The pall
bearers were all well-known lumbermen
who are in business about the bay. They
were: X C. Williams, J. H.- Tate, J.
Townsend, R. G. Bixby, C. E. Wilson and
Thomas Pollard.
The floral contributions were many and
beautiful in the extreme.
Postmaster's Salary Reduced.
BERKELEY, Cal., July s.â Among the
chances in postmasters salaries, made by
the authorities at Washington, is the re
duction of the allowance of the Berkeley
postmaster from $2500 to $2400 per year.
Postmaster McCarthy is still holding his
position, pending the decision of the Pre
sident as 10 who shall be the next post
master. It is expected daily that the new
man for the office will be named.
KeÂ«ler Talks on Art.
BERKELEY, Cal., July s.â The Uni
tarian summer school of liberal thought
was addressea at its session this moraine
by Rev. Dr. Payne, their pastor, who took
for his theme "A Modern Sermon on
Jesns."
Charles Keeler, the Berkeley poet, fol
lowed with an address to the Sunday
school on "Art and Science." The Uni
tarians feel much encouraged with the
progress they have matie in the line of
"liberal education," as they have called
it, and will continue for several months to
study nature and to emulate Shakespeare,
who said that there were "sermons in
stones, booKs in running brooks â good in
every thing."
MARKSMENAT SCHUETZEN
The California and Verein Ein
tracht Clubs Make Good
Scores.
Other Contests Postponed on Account
of the Fatigue Occasioned by
Celebrating the Fourth.
. The festivities of the Fourth evidently
proved too much for the riflemen who
were to have competed at Schuetzen Park
yesterday. Of the four organizations
which were to have occupied the stand the
California Schuetzen Club and the shoot
ing section of the San Francisco Verein
Eintracht were the only ones to face the
targets.
The former club held its regular monthly
medai shoot. Though the contestants
were not numerous the scores were very
good. They were as follows:
Champion class â A. Strecker, 428 rings.
Second champion class â Charles Thierbach
first, 436; Otto Burmeister second, 414. First

The following were the results:

PECULIARITY MAY
HINDER THE CURE,
Chinese Who Take the Goto
Treatment and Invite
Cold.
INDEPENDENT LEPERS.
Foast Pig and Other Delicacies
Enjoyed in Eonor of the
Fourth of July.
STRANGE BLOOD TRANSFUSION.
All the Afflicted at the Pesthouse Are
Living in Hopes That Their Curse
May Be Removed.
Â±Jret Harte's declaration that the
"heathen Chinee is peculiar" certainly
applies to the Chinese at the Pesthouse.
The water of the medicated baths in the
leprosy cure is heated to 90 degrees Fahr
enheit and kept at thct point as nearly as
possible. The batb is taken at least once
a day.
The bath was taken the first time on the
Fourth of July and repeated yesterday.
Now where "the heathen Chinee is pecu
liar" at tne Pesthouse is that several of
the Chinamen, after taking the bath and
coming from it covered with perspiration,
go out on the porch and sit in the cool
wind without a shirt or a coat on. The
result is that they will surely catch cold.
While a cold will not be any hindrance to
the effect of the medicine, it is likely to
have tbe effect of making the Chinese slop
tue medicine, as be will think it gave him
a cold.
Without exception all the lepers have
shown an entire willingness to take tbe
treatment, and in most instances they are
ca;er to do it. So far it has had no unde
sirable effect on them. A few felt a little
nausea from the pills yesterday, but this
will make no difference except possibly
with some of the Chinese. Pedro Penada,
the Mexican, takes the baths with profes
sional correctness. He envelopes himself
in a heavy overcoat, keeps it buttoned up
to his chin and takes things easy till he
cools off.
Superintendent Keating said yesterday
that the course of treatment is running
along smoothly. When asked why he did
not make the Chinamen observe proper
rules after coming out of the bath he said:
"We cannot force them into their shirts
and coats. If we did there would be a
row. Our plan is to give the treatment to
all who want it and hope to be benefited,
but we shall not force any one of them to
take it. They can laKe it or let it alone,
just as they choose."
The roast pij:, which did not arrive at
the Pestbouse in time'for dinner on the
Fourth, was served yesterday along with
other edibles that com Dosed a very good
dinner for the lepers. There are only
lepers in the Pesthouse. There has not
been a rase of smallpox there for five
years. By the bill of fare it will be seen
that the lepers fare well. There are many
others in the world who have not the mis
fortune to be lepers who probably did not
have the good fortune to sit down before
as good a dinner yesterday as
the lepers did, or as they eat every
day in the week. The Pesthouse
menu yesterday, eaten, as is the
common but erroneous supposition, with
a choking throat, a tearful eye and a feel
ing of hopelessness â for the lepers now
hope anew â was as follows:
HOTEL PESTHOOSB.
July 5, 1896.
MENT.
Roast Pig aud Apple Sauce.
Gravy and Dressing.
Green Peas.
Browned Potatoes.
Mince Pie. Beer.
Cafe >'oir,
or Coffee aud Cream.
This was a special dinner, but several of
the lepers had more than appears on the
bill of fare. There is not even a China
man in the institution so poor that he
cannot dig up enough money to buy some
thing when he wants that something
badly. So, in addition, some had Chi
nese deiicaoies on the side, and some
strawberries or raspberries and cream on
the side yesterday.
It was discovered the first time yester
day that the ler>er "Annie" has a husband.
This was not known to any of the China
men even. Annie wanted some money,
and she concluded to write to him for
some. That is the way the secret got out.
His name is Wah Wah Hun, and ne is a
conk in a mining camp near Salt Lake
City. Annie wrote the letter in Chinese
and lirected the envelope in Chinese, and
Superintendent Keating also put tne ad
dress in English on the envelope. There
is no leper in the Pestbouseâ a Lazarus â to
beg crumbs from the table of Dives.
Pedro Penada, the Mexican, is compara
tively wealthy. He flashes one or two
twenty -'3 oliar gold pieces on the boys once
in a while, just to gladden their eyes.
Senor Penada came from Oregon, where
he worked in a salmon-canning factory
before he was discovered to have the lep
rcpy. It seems that he belonged to a
mutual benefit society up there, and he
receives a regular remittance every month.
Nobody knows how much it is, but it is
not less than $40. Tne county pays for all
he er.ts and wears. When Pedro wants
anything, why he just sends out and buys
it and tbe messenger don't haggle about
theprice.
When any one of several Chinamen
want money they write on a piece of paper
and tell Superintendent Keating where to
take it. He goes down on Dupont or Sac
ramento streets to a certain number and
brings back $5 or $10.
The Burnt boys, the two whites, raise
chickens and canary birds and sell them.
They now have a cage of fourteen young
canaries in their room. They had bad
luck ibis time, for most of them are fe
males, and female canaries do not sing.
Tney made a large cage out of an old puir
of woven wire springs and some uprights.
A peculiar f:ict came to light at the pest
house yesterday. It was that the veins of
one oi tbe Chinese lepers was tapped not
long .i:*o aid the blood from the arteries of
a living dog put in to replace it. The dog
is stiil there. He is a woolly, drowsy-
I'toking canine. He belonts 10 the Mexi
can, who has given him an almost unpro
nounceable pet name. The blood that
was taken from the Chinaman was trans
ferred into the veins of the brute.
Strange to relate the Chinaman got bet
ter and the dog declined. The experi
ment was repeated several times and the
health of tie" Chinaman improved. But
he finally stopped taking the dog treat
ment and before iong was back at that
stage of leprosy he was at when he hrst
absorbed the canine blood.
It was also a striking fact that the dog
did n<>t take the leprosy and that it is im
possible to inoculate aim with it. A Dr.
Fitcli then took some virus from one of
the worst cases of leprosy in the pest
home and tried to inoculate the dog. It
hard.'y phased him. Senor Fenala has
his b.-loved companion to-day, snd his
flesh is plump and iiis eye is bright.
Frank Bimit, who has been in the pest
hoiiFe ten years and is now act In c as nurs*
for the other lepers, had a pnrt in these
experiments. He said yesterday after
noon that, considering the effect of the
dog's blood on the Ch'namau, he thought
impossible to cure leprosy with it if the
dog could be inoculated with the disease.
It was this idea that led Dr. Fitch to try
inoculation. So far it is a failure, and the
Dr. Goto internal remedies and baths have
replaced it.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Several Exciting and Closely Contested
- Games Played Yesterday.
-Handball sports witnessed several un
usually exciting games in the courts yes
terday, which were crowded. At the San
Francisco court J. Lawless and P. Hutch
inson. defeated G. Hutchinson and P.
Kelly in one of the cleverest games seen
in the court. The final was won by Law
less and P. Hutchinson by only one ace.
The event of the day was a match in which
J. Harlow, the ex-champion, played
against D. Johnson and J. Collins and de
feated them by two games to one.
The new lessees of the Union court,
Terry McManus and W. Doran, are gath
ering a large number of youn^ players to
the court, and yesterday it was crowded.
Both arc young men and keen players
themselves, and they, are determined to
make the court under their management
as attractive as possible.
Many of the players yesterday were
young men and several showed that they
were clever tossers. The event of the day
was a came between J. J. Feeney and
Terry McManus and James Nelson and J.
Ro^er. The two latter won the first two
games and it looked as if they would have
a walkover, but Feeney and McManus
pulled themselves together and won the
next three after some speedy play.
The talk among handball players is the
coming match between J. Harlow, the ex
coast champion, and Dick Lenihan, the
overhand wiper, for $50 a side, to be played
next Sunday at the San Francisco court.
Lenihan is a comparatively new player,
but for the past year he has come into
prominence and many old players look
upon him as the coming champion. He
defeated P. T. Donnelly, the amateur
champion, last week, and his friends think
that Harlow will meet the same fate. It
will be a game well worth seeing.
Following were the games played in the
courts yesterday:

CRICKETERS AT SAN JOSE
The Pacific Club Eleven Meets
the Garden City Com
bination.
The Contest Re nlted in an Easy
V.ctory for the San Fran
cisco Men.
Excepting the presence of a few enthu
siasts on practice bent, the two local
cricket grounds were deserted yesterday,
no cup match being on.
General interest was directed to San
Jose, where the Pacific team had gone to
meet the representative eleven of that fair
city. The match resulted in a compara
tively easy victory for! the visiting team by
121 runs on the first innings.
Acting Captain Charles B. Hill of the
Pacifies won tbe toss and sent his oppo
nents to bat. Their chief, W. S. Mayo, go
ing in first with Bowley, put up 22 runs in
excellent form and was tnen caught by
Casidy in the slips. His partner and Day
were the other principal contributors to
the total of 67 compiled by the team. Cap
tain Hill's 2 wickets for 3 and Harbour's
3 wickets for 3 wore the principal achieve
ments of the out team.
After being entertained with an elabor
ate lunch by their hospitable opponents
the Pacifies started their innings.
As will be seen by consulting the scores,
some valuable inning* were played. No
less than eight men reached double
figures, Wiseman, Dickinson, G. Theo
bald and his brother. A. P. Theobald,
doing the heaviest work. Had it not been
for the regrettable absence of Savior
Much, who, under the impression that tbe
match was to be played at Monterey, had
proceeded to that resort, the score. 188,
would doubtless have been greatly in
creasjd.
The analysis shows that B. Bowley se
cured most." of tbe Pacific wickets. Follow

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 6, 1896.
FOR THE GOOD
OF THE PUBLIC,
Opening of a New Branch
Library on Harrison
Street.
THE PEOPLE'S DEMAND.
It Is Conveniently Located at
Harrison and Ritch
Streets.
TO AID THE POORER CLASSES.
A Popular System to Help the Com
mon Schools and Educate
the Pubiic.
In response to a general demand of tbe
people of that district the board of
trustees of the Free Public Library has es
tablished a branch (No. 5) at 720 Harrison
street, with Miss N. A. Casey as librarian.
it is the policy of the trustees to supply
literary food to the people who need it
most and who reside in the most thickly
populated neighborhoods. It was calcu
lated that the establishment of a branch
library at the corner of Third and Howard
streets would minister to the intellectual
cravings of 50,000 persons residing within
a radius of half a mile. This location be
ing found to be impracticable a commodi
ous room on the ground floor, 30 by 50 feet,
in the two-story frame building at the cor
ner of Harrison and Ritch streets was se
lected in its stead.
A leading feature in the policy of the
trustees is to extend every possible ac
commodation to tbe poorer classes.
Wealthy persons can afford to ]oin a sub
scription library and it doesn't make any
material difference to tbem how far they
reside from the library, but with those
who live south of Market street and in tbe
outlying suburbs distant from the City
Hall the case is different. This is true
especially of the poorer classes, to whom
car fare is an item and who have not any
more leisure time than they need.
The free Public Library also aims to co
operate with the educational system of the
public schools by supplying monthly
classified topical reference lists, maps, gaz
etteers, etc, to the pupils of the primary,
grammar and high schools. To this end
branches are located as near as possible to
the public schoÂ»ls.
Within two months an elevator will be
in operation at the main library in the
City Hall. The patronaje then, it is an
ticipated, will be greatly increased, and
the trustees have petitioned th<Â» Board of
Supervisors for an appropriation cf $55.000,
an increase of $3000 over that of last year.
The main library was closed on* tne
Fourth for repairs and will not be open
until next Wednesday.
In Germany water pipes are boinp made
of glass, with asphalt covering to urevent
fracture, it is claimed that they give
thorough protection against moisture in
the ground, against the action of acids
and alkalies and that they cannot be pene
trated by pases.

smoky, sheltered twelve homeless women
last night, but their usefulness is now
operand they will be razed within the
next few days.
"It was just as we had finished eating
our luncheon," said Captain Barry last
evening, "and were occupied in prayer,
when we were informed that the building
was in flames.
"Walter Clark, the 3-year-old son of
Mrs. CJarK, an inmate of the Shelter, had
been quite naughty during prayer. His
childish prattle disturbed our worship and
we sent him into the backyard to play.
He haa been gone but a few moments,
however, when he came running back into
the dining-room and lisped out, 'House
fire and mamma will burn; so will we all
burn.'
"At first we discredited the baby's state
ment, tliinking the little fellow had seen
the s-niokeof an exploding firecracker, but
on hurrying into the yard we found that
his alarm was well founded.
"On finding that the shelter was indeed
in flame", the old lady inmates became
greatly excited and as fast as possible
they deserted the building. I then ordered
an alarm turned in through box 65, corner
of Mission and Sixth streets. The depart
ment responded promptly, but as the fire
had gained quite a headway it took con
siderable time and thousands of gallons of
water to extinguish it.
"About $250 worth of furniture was de

accommodate the twelve women, who will
occupy the remaining rooms to-night.
There were twenty-two inmates and two
babies sheltered in the building, and as it
was impossible to accommodate all in the
undestroyed rooms, we procured outside
lodgings for ten of them. They will re
main in their new lodgings until we pro
cure another buildrng. It is impossible to
ascertain just how the fire started, but I
am inclined to believe that it was caused
by a bomb."
Tears dim the eyes of the inmates of the
charitable institution as they look upon
the ruins of their once comfortable home.
It had been the only home they had known
for many months, and it was pitiful to see
them look with sorrowful eyes at the
charred timbers and blackened embers.
They moved in ami out of the burned
rooms, over the unsteady floor, and poked
into the ashes in search of little relics
which they had long treasured and had at
last been taken from them. Their posses
sions were few before the fire, now they
have none and they are heartbroken.
Captain McFee, whose headquarters are
on Market street, near Seventh, searched
many hours yesterday afternoon and last
evening for a suitable house for the
woman's shelter. He failed to find one of
suitable size and rent, however, but will
continue his search to-day.
-We lost fully $1000 by to-day's fire,"
said Captain McFee last evening; -'that is,
it will cost that much to refurnish a new
building and again place the institution
on a solid basis. We need helo lrom the
charitably disposed, and I hope we will re
ceive assistance."
BELLBOYS LAID IN WAIT.
Eight From the Baldwin Looked for
Their Unfaithful Leader.
The bellboy strike at the Baldwin Hotel
Saturday night came near resulting in the
complete humiliation of the man that
planned it. After he had made all ar
rangements for the walkout he lost his
nerve and remained at his place.
The eight who actually quit work lin
gered until very late in the neighborhood
of the hotel in the hope of meeting their
unfaithful leader, but they did not catch
him.
A mother of one of the "boys" went to
the hotel yesterday to attempt to have her
son reinstated, though be himself refused
to return.
Twelve new men have been employed to
fill the, places of those that quit and of
the doorbovs that were released recently
in expectation of the introduction of the
extra work to be given the bellboy force.
All the bellboys are now working under
the regulations that maintained before the
strike.
One of the old men says that the men
who went out expected too good fare for
hotel keep. "The grub ain't any too good ;
it ain't the best in the market or what the
guests get, but it's a darn sight better
than the help get at any of the other big
hotels in town."
OUR COURTS IN DISGRACE
Subject of Dr. Case's Theme Lust Even
ing at the Howard Methodist
Church. â¢
Dr. W. W. Case preached at the Howard
street Methodist Church last evening on
the subject "Our Courts in Disgrace." In
his sermon he made pointed allusions to
the pugilistic encounter recently enacted
in Judge Campbell's courtroom and the
gnn-drawing scene in the Ashley trial on
Thursday last. In the course of his re
marks Dr. Case said :
"Our church teaches us not to speaK evil
of magistrates or ministers. It is a very
good piece of advice. We ought to rever
ence things which are worthy of reverence.
Ministers of justice and ministers of the
gospel ought to be above reproach. They
should .be persons possessed of tiuch
j characters as shall merit the confidence
and respect of the people among whom
they minister.
"It is folly to expect justice from the
unprincipled. Tlie Germans have a pro-
I verb that 'Justice has a waxen nose.'
Whether in this City it be wax or putty,
in some persons it is decidedly twisted, to
I say the least. Our judiciary is supposed
j to stand for the very highest ideal of
honor. Ministers of justice as well as
ministers of the gospel are Â«xpected to be
the conservators of the public peace and
I morals. Of all men a judge ought to have
the elements of true manhood, and possess
those qualities which command the re
spect oi honest and intelligent people.
"The disgraceful scene in Judge Slack's
I court a few days ago does an untold
I amount of injury to public morals, though
so far as we can se% he is not at all re
i sponsible for it and proposes to bring the
offenders to account. But who is to ar
j raign the pugilistic Judge and fine him
! for cuntempt?
"The fully of carrying firearms was
shown in the unfortunate scene in Judge
SlacK's court. 'Enter not into tempta
tion.' A deadly weapon in the pocket is a
menace to good order always and every
where. It is a temptation in the moment
of excitement which is too often yielded to
with mournful results.
"Let our prominent men who are every
day making public sentiment conscien
tiously refrain from all practices unworthy
of imitation by the imitative multitude,
and they will unconsciously but power
fully aid social improvement and leave
behind them something more lasting for
good than 'footprints in the sands of
time.' "

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JTJLY 6, 1896.
TALKS WITH HER
DEAD HUSBAND,
The Hallucinations of Mrs.
Allie Gender, a
Widow.
SPELLS OF INSANITY.
She Wants to Join Her Husband
in the Spirit Land When
Under Them.
IS NOW IN A PADDED CFLL.
The Doctors at the Receiving HosÂ«
pita! Can See No Signs of In
sanity in Her.
The case of Mrs. Allie Gender, a widow
53 years of age, will form a subject for in
vestigation by the Insanity Commission
ers this morning.
She is in a padded cell in the Receiving
Hospital, charged with Insanity, but any
one who talks with her cannot see the
slightest sign of mental aberration in her
conduct or speech. Yet her friends say
she is crazy, and too dangerous to be at
large.
Twelve years ago her husband was killed
in a railroad accident He had an acci
dent polioy for $1500, and this sum was
paid to the widow, or rather to Albert
Shainwald, her brother-in-law, living at
207 Geary street, who was administrator of
her husband's estate.
The widow was left with three young
children, a boy and two girls. They were
put in a home and the mother worKed
hard to support herself and them. The
$1500 was placed on deposit in the San
Francisco Savings Union bank anri with
interest it has reached the sum of $2100. Of
this amount $300 has been withdrawn and
loaned to C. Petrie, a printer in Alame<la.
Mrs. Gender abont two years ago went
to live with her brother-in-law, but three
weeks ago she removed to 238 Bixtb street, i
where she engaeed a room. According to j
the landlady, Mrs. George, she showed ;
symptoms of insanity shortly after being j
in her house and on Saturday she became I
violent and threatened to take her life, so
Dr. Bohm was sent, for and he ordered
tbat she be sent to the Receiving Hospital.
Her chief hallucination is that her hus
band's spirit Is constantly with her.
When walking on the street she imagined
that he was beside her and she would con- j
verse with him as if he were in the flesh.
At night she would alarm every one in
the house by going from room to room
searching for her husband and when she
could not lind him she became violent and
had to be placed under restraint.
When she became calm she would talk
rationally and say she wanted to join her j
husband in the spirit land and if the
money was only divided among her chil
dren she would soon be with him.
The oldest, a young man 23 years of age,
is in Mendocino County, where he has
bought some Government land. One of
the girls is married and the other is a
servant with a family on Union street.
Apparently the money is not to be di
vided till the youngest, who is now 20
years of ace, attains the ace of 21.
Speaking of her arrest Mrs. Gender said
yesterday: "I think it is all a joke to
keep me here. I was in my room yester
day when two men wearing'blue uniforms
came and asked me to put on my shoes
anri come with them. Then they put me
in a patrol wagon and brought me here.
Eut I don't know why. lam not crazy
and I cannot see why I should be kept
here."
The doctors at the hospital who have
conversed with her say that she does not
exhibit the slightest symptoms of in
sanity, but the landlord and landlady of
the lodging-house at 238 Sixth street, Dr.
Bohm and others say that she has spells
and when under them she is violently
insane.
SOME BABIES IN THE ZOO,
The Elk and the Buffalo Fami
lies Each Have an
Increase.
Crowds at Sutrovilie by the Seaâ A
Venetian Carnival â Two Scenic
Railwaysâ Fall From a Tra n.
The family in the "Zoo" in Golden Gate
Park is increasing. About ten days ago
a baby elk made its appearance in the
deer park, the first one borr* there, and
yesterday morning another one came.
Within an hour after that the family in
the buffalo paddock was increased by one.
The new arrivals were concealed by their
parents in the brush and several days will
elapse before the youngsters will come
out from under cover to be gazed at by
those who delight in looking at the ani
mals and feeding them.
The only work of importance being done

To-day carpenters will commence put
ting up the partitions in the annex to the
museum, and workmen wili place in posi
tion the marble arch which will be the en
trance to the room in which the minerals
are to be displayed. This is the arch
which was at the Midwinter Fair, and
which was originally erected at th* min
eral exhibit at the Columbian Exposition
in Chicago.
J. L. Bardwell has donated a carved
wooden mask, the work of Hirazunia, a
noted Japanese wood-carver; the head of
â¢ seal and some antique pottery from
South America. W. D. Wooster has do
nated a very rare specimen of the owl
family.
On the Fourth more than 5000 persons
visited the museum.
The weather was not very clear yester
day, still there were a great number of
people at "Sutrovilie by the Sea" to watch
the many attractions, including the per
formance of a tight-rope walker, who
mane a successful trip in spite of the
heavy wind that was blowing.
Many within the baths were delighted
with the exhibition designated as "the
water carnival." There were a number of
barges and gondola?, bright in colors and
tinsel and filled with young women and
men in the picturesque costumes of
Venice, and when they were all in line in
tow of a small steam launch they pre
sented a pretty sight.
The first was a guard boat with a herald
which announced the approach of the
Doge and Duchess, and then came a shell
float representing the Venetian conception
of music. At the fore was an immense
swan, harnessed with riboons,
held by Master Chria Rove, who imper
sonated Cupid and was seated on a high
pedestal. In the center of the shell sat
Miss Grace Gay. a pretty .' blonde who im
personted the goddess of music, attired. in
flowing white robes and holding i a lyre.
The music was furnished by the band that
occupied seats in the rear of the shell.;
_ The carnival was also given in ihe even
ing, and will be repeated to-morrow after
noon and evening in honor of the conquest
of California. In ti e evening ii will be
presented with electrical effects in color.
The new scenic railway at "Sutroville by
the sea" was tested on the Fourth and it
was in' operation for an hour, but, owing
to the slackness of the cable used to ascend
the grades, it was decided to discontinue
the working of it until next Saturday, and
in the meantime s the ; fault will be reme

At the Haight-street grounds there was
a great crowd attracted by the many at
tractions. The performance of the Fourth
was repeated in the Casino in the presence
of a large audience. The haunted swing
proved a novelty. to many, and, above all,
the scenic railway, which was started on
the Fourth, did a rushing business. The
cars travel over a distance of 3600 feet up
(trade and down grade, around curves and
through a 600-foot tunnel, with a. rapidity
that is charming, but a little trying on the
nerves of timid people. â¢
During the afternoon a man named Wil
son, residing at 32 Sixth street, a passen
ger on the coast line of steam cars, while
the train was moving toward the Cliff, had
cis hat blown from bis head. He jumped
from the moving train to recover it, but in
so doing fell, and when "Fatty" Kahn,
the well-known swimmer, who sprang to
the ground, went to his assistance he
found him unconscious and bleeding from
several wounds of the fare. Kahn restored
him to consciousness and then dressed his
injuries, after which he sent him to his
home.

AN UNLOOKED-FOR DEATH
George Wailenrod's Friends Can
Scarcely Realize His
Suicide.
Some of His Old Associates Speak of
Him and a Desire to Help
His Widow.
The death of George Wallenrod in such
a tragic manner, coming so unexpectedly,
has thrown all his friends in this City, and
they are many, into sad thoughts as to
what could have caused "the old man," as
he was familiarly called, to tafce his life.
Jovial and bright at all times, even in
the face of crucial tests in business affairs,
he took the optimistic side of life, philo
sophically smiling at rebuffs and invitine
every one to celebrate events if they were
propitious.
That he should have gone down into a
dimly lighted cellar and blown his brains
out passes the comprehension of the peo
ple with whom be associated for years.
"I can't understand it in the least," was
the statement from Robert White, who,
for many seasons, filled the box-office at
tbe Alcazar.
''The old man was not the kind to com
mit suicide, so far as I could see his
nature. I have seen him when money
poured in almost faster than we could
count it, and, again, 1 have seen him when
he was a $6000 loser in two weeks. It was
all the same apparently, so far as his
actions indicated any feeling In the matter.
"He used to come in and ask me: 'Bob,
how's she coming?' I would answer
'Rotten,' and be would nod his bead, say
ing: 'AH right; she'll come better after
a while.' Then we would have a drink
and that was all. Care seemed to pass
away from him like water off a duck's
back."
L. R. Stockwell, one of the merriest of
comedians, stepped on the sta c of the
California Theater last night with a heavy
heart. Betier than auy man in the pro
fession he knew Wallenrod. Whether
agreeing ia business matters or not it was
always the same with these two old-time J
friends. They had been associated for
years when the Alcazar first opened, and
they coined money together at that time.
Their success in theatricals led them to
venture into speculation on the stock
market, and it was there that they both
lost all their accumulations of years and
more too. Stockwell quit the marnet and
went back to the stage, while Wallenrod
ceased his managerial career and stuck to
the mining market.
Alf Ellinghouse, who is managing the
California Theater at the present time,
knew George Wallenrod as well as any one.
For years he was in Wailenrod's employ,
and was a friendly adviser. In speaking
of the old gentleman's death last evening,
he expressed great sorrow, saying:
"There is nothing that I could that I
wouldn't do for his widow. If her husband
was improvident and speculated, it was
always that he hoped to make more.
More meant that his wife and children
would be better provided for and his purse
would be wider open to his friends. I
know he dealt in stocks, and he was not
unsuccessful for a time, but, I suppose,
like so many others who have gone before
him, the day of reverse must have come.
"However, I do not see how he could
have delved very heavily of late. His posi
tion as agent of the Alcazar building
hardly gave him much more than a living
income, say $80 or $100 per month. He
may have had other means I do not know
of with which to speculate. But, leaving
all this aside, I did not think that Wallen
rod would take his own life. He was a
big-hearted, good, jovial man. Full of
charity for others, he stood on his own
basis and askfd no favors. 1 think that
the theatrical profession could do worse
than to meet and do for his widow some
thing in return for the many good things
he did for them. lam willing."
George Wallenrod was a member in
good standing oi a dozen fraternal organi
zations, principal amonÂ£ which are the
Elks and the Theatrical Mechanics' Asso
ciation. These organizations will decide
to-day in regard to tbe funeral services.
In the meantime the body lies at the
undertaking parlors of Porter & Co., on
Eddy street. No autopsy, but an inquest
will be hell by the Coroner this morning.
In the Capitol Rotunda.
The unprecedented distinction wh'ch
awaits Mr. Cieveland is that his portrait
and figure are to appear in the great
frieze of the rotunda of the Capitol. Sen
ator Hansbrough and bis committee on
library have decided to finish out the
frieze, on which work was stopped seven
years ago, by adopting for the vacant pan
els these tnree historic scenes: (1) the
discovery of gold in California; (2) the
driving of the last spike in the trans
continental railway; (3) the formal
opening of the Columbian Expo
sition at Chicago by President
Cleveland. Sketches of three scenes
have been made by the artist C'ostagginni,
aud in a few days these sketches will be on
exhibition in the marble room of the Sen
ate. Probably they will create a good deal
of a sensation. The Democratic ana Popu
listic Senators who hate Mr. Cleveland so
intensely are expected to put in a vigorous
protest against painting the face and hgure
of the President in the great frieze, there
to remain as long as the Republic stands.
The idea is repugnant to them, and a few
of them wiio have heard of the plan have
sworn to kick up such a row as never be
fore seen in the Capitol. According to their
notion it would be an eternal disgrace to
the United States to put the President up
there among the saints and heroes of the
Republic. â Washington correspondent of

THEY ARE ALL
SO VERY OLD,
Members of the Police
Force Slated to Be
Pensioned.
I. W. LEES AMONG THEM.
The Board of Police Commis
sioners Will Meet This
Morning.
IT'S THEIR ANNUAL REUNION.
Detective Bohen, Captain Dunleavy,
Sergeants Shi< Ids and Lindheimer
in Doubt.
This is the morning when the Board of
Police Commissioners must in compliance
with the law, meet as a Board oi Pension
Commissioners.
The duties of the two boards are vastly
different. The same triumvirate reigns
supreme in both cases; but, in one, it
whips the police department into line
and penalizes the club wielders for their
shortcomings, or in aggravated cases, dis
misses them from the force. In the other,
the czars of the department hold a sort of
anti-mortem meeting in which they de
cide upon tha members of the force who
have outlived their usefulness.
They do not tell them so when they
reach a decision, but those whose posi
tions are wanted generally find it out and
resign. It looks much better that way
than to be dropped from the roll, and
those members of the force who have
served for twenty years consecutively are
entitled to half pay of the grade they were
in at the time of the resignation until â
well, until death.
The meeting of the czars this morning
has more significance than the usual quar
terly reunions.
Last year at this time â the first Monday
in July â the Police Commissioners de
cided that new blood must be infused
into the force. Captain Wittman, the ris
ing Napoleon of them all, had shown ex
ecutive ability entitling him, according to
Commissioner Alvord, to a better rank
than sergeant. In the six years it took
him to master the grades from patrolman
up, he had shown the public and his su
periors he was the intellectual and execu
tive master of the set around him.
Captain Douplass was thouehtof as a
man who had done noble service for over
thiriy-five years. He was obi, nearly
three score and ten, about time he should
retire and indirectly he was given until
July 29, 1895, to do so. It was not com
pulsory, however, and the captain, who
had been quite ill for some time but who
felt strong and vigorous once more, did
not accept the invitation. On the follow
ing meeting day of the Commissioners he
was dropped from the roll on $75 monthly
salary so long as he lives.
At the same time Captain Douglass
made way for Captain Wittmnn, Captains
Stone, Short and Cullen were given a tip
to resign. All did it but Captain Cullen
who, for some thirty years, had been of
ficiating as property clerk. His position
was a hard one to fill, hence the czars
contented themselves with the resigna
tions of Stone and Short, Sergeant Corhn
and Patrolmen Gallagher and Asher. In
the meantime Sergeant James Moran was
instructed to make himself familiar with
the duties of the property clerk's office in
case his services were needed as its chief.
Thi? was no difficult task for Moran, but
the czars did not find it necessary to dis
place Captain Cullen just then, giving him
another year in which to retire. The poor
old man d'ed a week aeo and Moran was
on Friday night last appointed his
successor.
When all the resignations and dropping
from the roll alluded to here occurred
Commissioners lobin and Alvord as well
as Mr. Gunst, who was then quite young
in office, but who had done much to infuse
the new blood in the department, stated
that in another year more changes would
be made.
There are some dozen or more eligibles
for the nension list. They do not like to ac
knowledge it, but the stern face remains
that they have passed the age of 60 years
and they have been faithful and hard
workers for the public benefit for twenty
years and more. They do not want to be
retired, however. As a rule they have
saved up little or nothing of their earnings
and their families have increased. The
idea of havlne to be idle henceforth, and,
worse still, to be idle on half pay, does not
sit well upon them.
These eligible* know they are listed to
make way for "pew blood," and thÂ°y do
not like it a little bit. Their names were
mentioned lost year, wlien another year's
grace was accorded them. Now, as strong
in their claim as they have ever been that
no younger man can do any better than
they, they look with dread upon this morn
ing's meeting of the czars.
"Will it of will it not?" is the thought
as to the coming of the tip to resigu in the
minds of the old-timers.
Captain Lees is among them, too. That
old veteran, whose personal fortune makes
him care as little for his half pension as he
does for the whereabouts of Dunham and
Blanther, is as strong and bright mentally
as he was forty yÂ°ars aco when he first
joined the force. His whole life, you
micht say, has been devoted to the chas
inc of criminal?, and he does not propose
to move down and out to make room for
"new blood."
Something more than a tip will be
necessary. In his case, however, as in
that of Dectective Arnop Bainbrilge, it
would be hard to find a successor of equal
merit. Hence, it is not likely the tip will
be given. But if it isn't to-day, it will be
to-morrow or the next day that Sergeants
Lindheimer, Shields. Con Martin, Brown
and Hotaling, Detective Bohen and Cap
tain Dunleavv will hear the wires tap.
They are all so old.

AMBITIOUS YOUNG JAPS,
They Are Now Anxious to Join
the National Guard of
California.
Success in the Parade Inspires a De
sire for Something More Than
Cherry B ossoms.
The ambitious little brown men who cut
such a swell figure in the National cele
bration on Saturday last are not satisfied
with the laurels earned on that occasion.
They simply had a taste of genuine Amer
ican patriotism, and now they long for a
closer bond.
In brief, the Mikado's subjects, or,
rather, those marching in the parade, are
anxious to join the National Guard of
California. How to go about it, pre
suming they are eligible, is what troubles
them. If the thing can be done, however,
it will not be long before the first Amer
ican Japanese military will be ushered
into existence.
' Tbe Japanese club was organized about
two years ago for social purposes only.
As it grew in strength, however, the war
spirit developed, with the result that the
men were instructed ir. the different niove
ments. The club now numbers hf;y mem
bers, the military end being under the
command of S. Yaraato. There was some
little friction with the .fourth of July com
mittee as to how the club should appear
in the parade. Several loyal members in
sisted on carrying Japanese flags along
with the red, white and blue. TheAsahi
band at first refused to play unless this
concession was granted.
Finally, however, everything was ar
ranged satisfactorily, and now tbe gallant,
