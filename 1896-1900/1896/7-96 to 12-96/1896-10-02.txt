PROTECTION
THE POLICY
Three Special Trains Take
Hundreds of Voters
to Canton.
WOMEN ARE AMONG THE
VISITORS.
Three Marching Clubs Composed
Entirely ot Members of the
Fairer Sex.
BAIN DOES NOT DAMPEN THE
ARDOR AT ALL.
In No Uncertain Tones Major McKinley
Speaks for Protection and
Sound Money.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. Lâ lt took three
special trains to brinp tbe Portage County
(Ohio) delegation to Canton to-day and it
numbered more than 1600. There were
McKinley and Hobart clubs from all the
towns in the county and three marching
clubs composed entirely of women. In
the drizzling rain they marched, with flags
flying and bands playing, through the
streets of Canton toward Major McKin
ley's residence. When they were within
two blocks of it the indications of a heavy
storm seemed so strong that the long line
of enthusiastic citizens turned and trudged
back to the Tabernacle. The spokesman
for the Portage County people was ex-
State Senator S. P. Wolcott. In response
to hi 3 remarks Major McKinley made a
speech which was greeted from start to
finish with cheers and tumultuous ap
plause.
"We propose in this contest to protect
onr money from debasement, and with
the same votes to protect our industries
from foreign competition," exclaimed
Major McKinley in commencing his re
marks, and this utterance was the key
note of his speech.
Continuing, be said:
In the great contests of the past, both ;in
war and in peace, the Republican party has
done proud and conspicuous service in the
cause" of â liberty, * honor, justice and truth.*
{Applause.} Let us preserve her splendid ex
ample. [Great : applause, and cries of "We
will.]" The issues of the present campaign,
culta-^s^tsUtiCtlyiwTaiiy or the, great cam
ffjigne of the past, devolve upon every, Ameri
igns of the past, devolve upon every Ameri
can citizen an important duty. â  Our conten
tion this year appeals to the ' best aspirations
of American citizenship, and" involves just as
great interests as any campaign in the past.
We cannot close our eyes to the fact that if
by our ballots we ruin the credit ot the Gov
ernment, repudiate its honest obligations in
whole or In part, or deliberately depreciate a
valuable element of its currency, we have
aimei & blow at its hitherto unsullied name
and honor. My fellow-citizens, will we permit
the name and honor of this great Nation to be
Builied or tainted? [Loud cries of "No,
never."] This is the year to settle for all time
that our National honor will not be tainted.
No State of the Union ought ever to declare ior
a financial policy that encourages the viola
tion of contracts, the repudiation of debts or
the debasement of our circulating medium.
It should be the common aim and pride of all
at all times to preserve American credit and
uphold public law. [Great cheering.]
You come from a section of our Ptate very
near and dear to me; that has been distin
guished in its history in the very beginning as
standing ior the highest type of American
citizenship and the nighesi ideals in govern
ment; for having exacted of its public ser
vants the most scrupulous regard for good
faith and good morals in every public law and
transaction. And â¢ duty devolves upon you
in the pending campaign which I am sure you
will, with scrupulous fidelity, perform, to
maintain your high standard of the past. The
grand old Western reserve is full of patriotic
recollections. It i- the homo of Wade, of Gid
dings, ot Garfieid [Great applause], and the
home of the most splendid Republicanismâ
the civilization that has produced many of
the leaders of Republican thought who have
occupied the very outposts of human liberty
in all the years of the past, ihe grand old
Western reserve must roll up sneh a Republi
can majority in November as it hes never be
fore recorded, and demonstrate once more its
patriotism and love of country. [Applause.]
Never has the Republican cause more clearly
appealed to conscience and intelligence than
in this campaign. The patriotism for which
you are so justly celebrated must not be
abated. The strong, clear voice of our people,
which has been heard so distinctly in perilous
time.s 61 tiie past, must again resound through
out the Nation iv thunder tones for truth and
justice and honor and honesty. [Applanse.l
Your glorious past appeals to you to abate no
effort becaiiÃ â  the tide of public opinion seems
40 -strongly in your favor. It is an interesting
recollection that eiphteen years ago, wheu
rour county was a part of my Congressional
district, we were fighting for the same princi
ples which are engaging the country now.
Then we were contending for an American
protective tariff that should care forad Ameri
can interests, and were contending for the re
sumption of specie payments, for an honest
value, a 100-cent dollar. Then it was that you
gave to me.the then standnrd-bearer.the large- 1
majority that you ever gave any candidate for
Representative in Ume of Beace. Now, in the
year of 1896, let there be a similar, aye, a '
stronger, verdict in favor of protection reci
procity, sound money and National honor.
[Applause.]
A few minutes after the Portage County
delegation left the ball the Springfield
(Ohio) delegation arrived and it proved to
be one of the most earnest and enthusi
astic crowds tbat has been seen here. It
was composed of the various Republican
clubs of ClarK County.
When Major McKinley appeared on the
stage at the Tabernacle the Springfield
men rose to their feet, tossed their hats in
the air and shouted for several minutes.
Major R. B. Herver, commanding me Mc-
Kinlt-y and Hobart Brigade, called the
meeting to order and the members of the
brigade arose and saluted the candidate.
J. C. Barnett introduced the spokesman,
Judge John C. Miller, who made a brief
speech-, bristling with good points. In re
sponse Major McKinley said:
It gives me extreme pleasure to meet at my
home to-day the representative citizens of
Springfield and Clark County. And 1 nÂ»vÂ«i
The San Francisco Call.
Grand Jury â "We may not be to put
you in San Quentin, but we can keep you out of
California."
A CHANGE HAS COME OVER THE SPIRIT OF ITS DREAMS-
stand before a Springfield audience without
having come unbidden to my lips some of the
precious names associated with that enter
prising city. Shalaberger [applause] was not
only a distinguished lawyer but an eminent
statesman, and that dear old citizen, Judge
White [applause], whose learning enriched
the judiciary of the State. Names HI jho-e
come to me whenever I see a Springfield audi
ence. It is not given to many cities to furnish
as yours has as distinguished and as valued a
man aa ti,e ex-Speaker of the Kational House
of Representatives, J. Warren Keefer. [Ap
plause], Nor is it given to many cities to have
furnished as yours has that splendid ideal
business man and distinguished executive,
the present Governor of Ohio, Asa S. Bushnell.
[Applause.]
Cyrus H. McCorxnick of Chicago, who was at
the head of one of the great harvesting
machine companies, the strength and in
tegrity of which the country is familiar with,
recently wrote aa follows: "We have never
before been so at a loss to lay out our plans
and work for the next season as we are at
thia time. If we thought that the country
would go for the unlimited coinage of silver
â¢vve would not wish to run our shops for more
than half their capacity."
We have In that statement, my fellow
citizens, a description of our business trouble,
and it teaches a striking lesson which must
impress every thinking man. The manufac
turer does not know how to plan for next
year's business because of the financial uncer
tainty concealed by the altitude of one of the
great political parties of this country in con
nection with two other parties. [Applause.]
If free silver is to be inaugurated in this coun
try it will change all values, disarrange the
re ations of labor to production of raw ma
terial to the finished product and unsettle all
conditions of existing business and property.
[Anplause.[
â¢ This certainly makes every business man
pause; capital hesitates to invest because it
fees danger ahead and is unable to count with
certainty upon either the safety of its princi
pal or the return of profits. Take your own
city, which has heretofore been one of the
busiest centers in the manufacture of agri
cultural implements, employing 5000 laborers,
or once did. [Great laughter and applause.]
To cut that employment iv two would be
not only a calamity to labor, but would be a
calamity to every interest in your city and to
every farmer in your county. Your business
facilities illustrate the close relations be
tween the manufacturer and the agricultural
producer. When you are prosperous the
farmer is prosperous. When the farmer Is
prosperous you have your most profitable
trade. Business of every character is so inter
woven, (independent and interdependent
upon every other business that to hurt one is
to hurt the other.
Iv 1892 people used to think that you could
hurt the manufacturer and help the rest ot
mankind. They labor under no such delusion
now. Demand is what makes business activ
ity. The sickle and the flail would still be In
use but tor the pressing demand of the great
grain fields of America. You make aericul
tural implements because the farmer wains
them; but when he does not want them you
will not make them, or wants fewer of them,
you will not make so many, and when that
time comes and you diminish your output
you don't need so much labor, and that is what
makes poverty and idleness. We must have
stability in values nnd confidence in National
and individual integrity before we will have
real an 3 permanent prosperity. We must
have confidence that our revenue legislation
will isuDpiy adequate money for the public
treasury and protect American labor and
American interests in every Dart of the coun
try.
Alexander Hamilton once said: "There is
scarcely any point in the economy of National
affairs of greater moment than the uniform
preservation of the intrinsic value of the
money unit. Osi this the securiy and steady
value of property essentially depends." [Ap
piause.]
We must get over the idea, my fellow-citizens,
if we ever had it, that Congress by its mere
breath can make something out of nothing;
that It can decree that 53 cents of silver shall
be worth 100 cents. Confess can do much;
it can protect the life and property of citizens,
as it should do; it can provide revenue laws
which will make the treasury easy and protect
American producers from the unrestrained
competition of the Old World. It can do that,
and it must do that [tremendous cheering];
but it cannot by its mere stamp make a dollar
worth a hundred cents out of a piece of coin
which sells in every market of the world for 53
cents. [Applause.]
The great Senator from New York, Roscoe
Conkling, once said: "I do not believe you
can legislate up the value of anything any
more than I think you can make all men
heroes by legislation." [Applause.] ThÂ«'.con
tinental congress tried to legislate values up
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 2, 1896.
by resorting to penalties, but the inexorable
laws of trade, as independent as the laws of
gravitation, kept them don. [Applause.]
After the speech-making there were
songs by the glee clubs and Major Mc-
Kinley was presented with a gold horse
shoe, the receipt of which was acknowl
edged in c a few words by Mr. McKinley.
Mr. Thomas presented General Harrison
with a horseshoe of bis own fashioning in
ISBB and he thinks this shoe sure to bring
good luck.
ROGER WOLCOTT FOR GOVERNOR.
Republicans of Massachusetts Nominate
State Officers.
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. I.â The Republi
cans of Massachusetts in State convention

Treasurerâ Edward P. Shaw.
Auditorâ John W. Kiraball.
Attorney-General â Hosea Moulton.
The convention was called to order in

Messrs. Lyman and Talbot were elected
temporary officers. Chairman Lyman de
livered an address and at its conclusion
the usual committees were appointed.
The representative of tbe committee on
credentials read tbe report, which was
adopted.
When Mr. Draper arose to speak he was
preeted with a storm of applause. Mr.
Draper said in part:
The logic of events has brought the cur
rency question into the greatest prominence.
The real question is whether we shall change
the standard which fixes the value of our cur
rency. Ido not believe that a majority of the
voters in this country can be secured for any
such policy.
Draper's remarks were enthusiastically
cheered.
The platform was then read and adopted.
It indorses the platform adopted at St.
Louis and recommends the unalterable
opposition ot the convention to the free
and unlimited coinage of silver by this
country alone; the enactment of tariff
laws which will provide revenue adequate
for the payment or the National expendi
tures and the gradual reduction of the
National debt, promote the policy of reci
procity and preserve our own markets to
our own people are advocated.
Presidential electors were then chosen,
after which nominations for Governor were
in order. Ex-Governor Brackott presented
Mr. Wolcott's name and he was nom
inated by acclnmation. W. M. Cran-'s
name was then presented and he was

MAD WORK
OF A GALE
Fearful Havoc Caused by
the Hurricane in
Georgia.
MANY SECTIONS COVERED
WITH RUINS.
Buildings Could Not Withstand
the Terrible Force of
the Wind.
ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
THE VELOCITY.
Churches and Structures ot Every
Description Reduced to Heaps
of Wreckage.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Oct. Lâ Telegraphic
communication between Savannah and
Florida has not been restored since the
hurricane of Tuesday snapped the wires
as it came up northward from the gulf.
The blow came ashore from the gulf on
the coast line extending from Tampa to
Cedar Keys, Tampa getting only the
southern edge of tbe blow. The registry
of the velocity of the wind at the Govern
ment Weather Bureau at Jacksonville
showed the remarkable and unprecedent
ed record of nearly 100 miles an hour.
The path of greatest severity of tbe
storm seems to have been about forty
miles wide. After passing over a strip of
territory lying within the noithern part
of the State, tbe storm passed on to the
Atlantic coast, which it followed north.
The storm passed around Tampa, and very
little damage resulted from the wind; bnt
the high tides played havoc, and several
thousand dollars' damage was done to
property along the bay.
Shipping along the river front suffered
considerably. The tide overflowed Port
Tampa City, and the lower floors of many
houses were under water.
At Jacksonville the damage was con
fined to the demolition of trees and signs.
At Newberry the wholesale and retail
store of Williams Brothers, containing a
stock of goods valued at $15,000. was blown
down and most of the goods ruined. A
phosphate plant was demolished and all
the horses were killed. At Gracey the
sawmill plant of Gracey & McDonald, the
largest in this part of the State, is a com
plete wreck, and thousands of acres of
timber lands were destroyed.
The heaviest losers are the turpentine
manufacturers. Those heard from report
a total loss, and since that time they were
compelled to go out of business. All the
trees aro down and it is impossible in
many places to ride through the woods
even on horseback. The loss to timber in
this vicinity will reach $500,000.
Caliahan reports a number of dwellings
and two churches entirely torn to pieces.
Two Savannah, Florida and Western
Railway buildings were unroofed. The
loss will amount to $200,000. At Maclenny
the Baptist church and one of tbe largest
stores were blown flat upon the ground,
the principal boarding - house was un
roofed, the County Jail suffering the same
fate and a number of small dwellings were
razed.
At Gainesville a building erected by D.
F. Cooper for a sawmill, but which was
full of fu liiture. was totally destroy d and
I a warehouse demolished.
In Branford the Presbyterian and Meth
odist churches were blown to the ground.
The Drew Lumber Company's mill is a
wreck. The roof .was blown from Gilbert's
mill and about one-third of tbe tin roof
was blown from the Plant system depot.
The store of W. Williams, general mer
chandise, was badly wrecked.
At Lake Butler, seventeen miles west of
Stark. Adams Bros.' and Thomas & Sons'
stores were wrecked. The Baptist church
and the old courthouse were blown down.
McKinney's ginhouse was blown down
and the cotton scattered. Fort White
caught the full force of the blow. Nearly
every store and dwelling in town was more
or less damaged. The Method'st, Baptist
and Presbyterian churches were demol
ished. The public-school building shared
their fate. The Plant system depot was
unroofed.
High Springs claims the air monster
scorched through the town at the rate of
100 miles an hour. Trees and houses went
down like cardboards and only half a
dozen houses are left to point out to the
investigators the once prosperous town.
How much damage was done at the
Ceaar K/ys has not been learned at Sa
vannah yet. It is not probable, however,
that the storm proved more destructive
there than at otber points in the State.
Other towns in Florida felt the force of
the blow, but the damage done was trivial.
None of the famous large hotels suffered
to any extent worth mentioning.
ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. I.â A special to
tbe Constitution at midnight says the
storm that struck Cedar Keys did much
damage. Many persons are reported to
have been killed.
DESOLATION AT CEDAR KETS.
Many Perished During the Sweep of the
Storm in Florida.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. I.â Cedar
Keys is a place of desolation and death.
Forty-eight hours ago it was a thriving
town of 1500 inhabitants. To-day many
of the people are corpses, scores of others
injured, and there are but few houses left
standing.
Twenty corpses have been recovered. It
is known that many other persons have
been killed. Of those recovered but few
have been identified, so mutilated were
tbey by falling timbers. Many of the
corpses were dus; out of the wreckage
under which they were buried.
Of the twenty bodies recovered twelve
are white and eight colored. Of the
whites six belonged to the Whitson
family â a mother, four children and a
young woman visitor. The other four
white victims are men, and have not yet
been identified.
Of the eight colored, only one, Peter
WoodÃon, has been identified. Deplor
able as the loss of life is, it is as nothing
compared with the number of spongers
and fishermen who were drowned.
Tbe Mary Eliza, a sponging schooner,
reached Cedar Keys at io o'clock this
morning jury-rigged, having had to cut
both masts away to prevent capsizing.
It reports that Monday nisht nearly a
hundred vessels were anchored just be
low Cedar Keys, and that nearly every
one of them was sunk by the hurricane.
At daylight on Tuesday morning the
captain of the Mary Eiiza says he saw
only twenty of the 100 sponging and fish
ing vessels afloat, the others having gone
to the bottom during the early hours of
the storm.
Twelve of the twenty vessels that rode
out the hurricane during the hours of
darkness, the captain says, went down at
8 o'clock on Tuesday morning.
Beyond the bay tops of scores of masts
are visible just above the water, and each
top indicates the burial place of a spong
ing schooner and its crew.
ONE FAT ALI TY AT WASHINGTON
And Others May Periah From Injuries
Received in the Atortn.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. I.â The
Southern hurricane, which swept over this
city with such disastrous results on Tues
day night, left one fatality and probably
several more in its wake. The body of
James F. Fitzgerald was discovered in the
rums of the Beatty saloon, 1213 Pennsyl
vania avenue, at 8 o'clock this morning.
Advices from points on the Potomac
River report an alarming rise in the river
at all points above Washington. At Har
pers Ferry a rise of thirty-one feet above
low-water mark was noted early in the
afternoon and a continued rise seems to
have followed. Flood river signals are
displayed along the river front and at a
comparatively early hour to-night a rise is
reported, though not to an alarming ex
tent. The alaiming condition is creating
considerable uneasiness among those
along the water front in tnis city.
SHOOTS A FORMER EMPLOYER.
Coachman Dumont/ere Fatal// Wounds
George E. Sheldon and Leaps
From a High Bridge.
MARQTJETTE, Minn., Oct. 1. â George
E. Sheldon, brother of Hon. Carlos D.
Sheldon, Republican nominee for Repre
sentative in Congress from the Twelfth
District, was shot at Houghton to-day by
a discharged employe named Felix Du
montiere. Two weeks ago Sheldon had
reprimanded his coachman for a lapse of
duty and was knocked down. To-day the
coachman was arrested for assault, and
the trial was set for Saturday. To-night
Dumontiere met Sheldon on the bridge
crossing Portage Lake and emptied the
chamber of a revolver as short range into
his victim, inflicting probably fatal
wounds. One buliet entered the neck and
another lodged in the brain.
Immediately after the murderous deed
Dumontiere jumped from the bridge, a
height of 100 feet, into the lake and disap
peared. It is believed he was drowned.
He leaves a destitute widow and five chil
dren. His victim is one of the most
highly respected citizens of Northern
Michigan. ___________

LONDON, Eva., Oct. Lâ The Evening
News baa.publbhe-i a dispatch asserting
that Great Britain iiaa notified tlie poweis
that unless immediate and energetic action
is taken by them to effect a settlement of
the Turkish situation, England will act
alone. No confirmation of this statement
is obtainable.
The Vienna correspondent of the Daily
Mail telegraphs tbat the powers have
agreed upon a pacific settlement of the
Eastern question which is honorable to all
parties. He adds that the agreement
amply guarantees the future security of
the Armenians.
Tbe Chronicle will to-morrow publish a

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey. Oct. I.â
Considerable excitement was caused in
the Yeni Kapu quarter last evening by
the explosion of a bomb. The police say
that the explosion, which did no damage,
was the result of an effort on the part of
an Armenian woman to get rid of a num
ber of bombs which she had in her posses
sion.
She was in the act of throwing tbe
bombs into the sea when one of them ex
ploded. A cordon of troops has been
thrown into Peruzagha, the Turkish quar
ter. This action is believed to be a pre
cautionary measure against trouble grow
ing out of the arrest of certain Turks con
nected with the recent riots.

COLLAPSE OF A STAND
AT BURLINGTON.
An Accident Mars the Opening
of a Semi-centennial
Celebration.
BUT THE INJURED OFFICIALS
DELIVER ADDRESSES.
Achievements of the State of lowa
During Fifty Years Are Re
viewed.
BURLINGTON, lowa, Oct. I.â The cele
brat nof the semi-centennial ot lowa to
day was marked by an accident wnich.
narrowly missed proving serious to the
Vice-President of the United States, Gov
ernor Drake and others. As it is there
wiil probably be one death.
After the grand parade had been formed
for the opening of the semi-centennial fes
tivities and nad covered about half of the
line of march Governor Francis Drake and
staff, Vice- President Stevenson and all of
the State and local officials were conducted
to a renewing stand. Scarcely were they
seated when the stand gave way with a
crash and the entire structure went to the
ground, a mass of broken timbers.
The injured:
E. S. Burrus, County Treasurer, two
fractures of the lee and internal injuries;
now in a hospital in this city.
Vice - President Stevenson, left leg
bruised and knee slightly sprained.
Governor Drake, bruised and shaken.
Ex-Governor Sherman, badly bruised
and shaken.
Secretary of State McFarland, ankle and
leg sprained.
Senator Kent of Lee County, head cut.
Colonel H. 0. Weaver of Wapello, ankle
sprained.
Mayor Nauman, badly bruised.
Major Wyman ci Ottumwa, spine seri
ously injured.
Lafayette Young, edicor of the lowa
Capital, badly cut and bruised in head.
Fred L. Porr, city clerk, bruised and cut.
Mary Lord Drake, daughter of the Gov
ernor, slightly bruised.
Secretary Jones, State Commissioner,
leg injured.
A score of others were bruised and
shaken by the fall. Women fainted and
great confusion at once reigned. Governor
Drake and Vice- President Stevenson were
on the front tier of seats and were thrown
backward upon the others and thus
escaped fatal injury, but were badly shaken
up and considerably bruised. Ex-Gov
ernor Sherman was in the rear of the
stand and fell at the very bottom of the
mass. He was found with a heavy timber
across his legs and a plank resting on his
neck and back.
The sufferers were conveyed to hospitals
and hotels and their injuries promptly
attended to.
The stand was a private affair, hastily
constructed, and had not been inspected
like the others. The crowd was wa~ned
not to go on it, as i he officials were ail who
were intended to occupy it, and for them
it was sufficiently strong, bnt a rush was
made and the stand went down.
Serious as it was it had its funny side.
Governor Drake, with his hat pulled
over his ears, was found sitting m the lap
of Vice- President Stevenson. The latter's
hat was also crushed over his face, and
neither could move until aid came.
Governor Drake recovered from his
bruises, and shaking up sufficiently to
deliver a short address at the Colisseum
this afternoon.
Ex-Governor Sherman, owing to his age,
may be seriously hurt, althoueh he claim!
to be only badly bruised and shaken up.
This afternoon State Commissioner P.
M. Crapo opened the exercises at the Col
isseum before a vast crowd.
He was followed by Governor Drake,
who spoke for forty-five minutes. The
official poem entitled, "lowa,* 1 was read
by the author, S. H. M. Byers of Dea

To-nieht was held a grand carnival in
which a barge representing a fortress was
attacked by a float of one hundred boats,
using Roman candles and bombs for
ammunition. It is estimated that 20,000
people watched the display at the river
front and that 10,000 were at the park this
afternoon.
Vice-President Stevenson spoke at a
banquet given in honor of himself and
Governor Drake to-night. The Vice-Presi
dent said:
I am confident that I voice the deep feeling
of all the people of the great State which lies
across tbs Mississippi when I say that Illinois
rejoices with lowa upon this, her fiftieth anni
versary. We rejoice with you in your wonder
ful developmsnt and prosperityâ ii, the glory
that is yours, as to-day you round out the first
ha'.f centnry of your history as a State of the
Federal Union. The twenty-ninth to seek ad
mission, tbis historic day, which marks but a
little span in the life of a Stateâ the day whose
coming has been awaited with such deep in
terestâfinds lowa tenth upon the list of the
great commonwealths that make up the Amer
ican Republic.
In all the steps that antedated admission
you had the earnest co-operation of Illinois
through her delegation in Congress; and fifty
years ago this day, at her ancient capital,
twenty guns voi ed Illinois's congratulation!
to lowa. No longer a Terriiory, but a State,
henceforth during all the ages, an indestructi
ble State of an indivisible Union. How won
derful the progress of the Btn te and the Nation
during the half century just closed! What
wonderful events moke up the woof and warp
of their marvelous history I How inspiring to
those in old age to behold the glory of thia2
day, as memory brings vividly before them the
event we now celeDrate!
BÂ«ck through the vista of years is tne fron
tier Tillape upon the Mississippi and the
eparsely populated pioneer State whose Wert
cm limit marked the border line of civiliza
tionâto-day a splendid city, a magnificent
State. This is the fitting place lor the august
ceremonies in which we are permitted to late
part. We stand on historic ground. Here the
officials of the old territorial regime quietly
yielded up the symbols of authority to suc
cessors clothed with higher dignity and
power.
Here they gathered from far Â«nd nearâ the
sturdy citizen, the pioneer, tne f rontiersmanâ
to witness the wonderful transformation and
bid godspeed to the new State. "Ring oat the
old, ring in the new."
The record of illustrious deeds brightens the
pages of your history; but none more worthy
of remembrance than of the deeds of the men
â who led the van, who marked out the path
way, who set up the public defenses, who were
literally the builders of the State.
This hour witnesses the close of the first
cnapterâ the dose of the first half century of
lile of this great commonwealth. What sacri
fices, what s truggles, what heroic deeds of
noble men and women, what marvelous
achievements are bound up in these fifty years
of history 1
Another anniversary and what wonders will
meet the eyes of tho3e who upon this historic
ground shall celebrate the first centennial of
theSUtet What has been brought out amid
the conflict of the past is but the earnest of
the marvelous achievements of the coming
century. The American Spirit is one that
knows no rest. In the words of Macaulay:
"The goal of to-day is but the starting post for
to-morrow." ThÂ« past is secure, the records of
fifty years of trials and triumphs are safely
garnered up.
Grateful to God for the successes, the achieve
ments, the blessings of the past, the people of
this grand commonwealth to-day turn their
faces resolutely, hopefully to the future.

for MeKinley.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct, Lâ Chauncey
M. Depew is getting ready to invade the
West. He is to make a memorial address
at Galesburg, 111., on October 7, and he
intends to take advantage of his presence
in the West to make one or two political
speeches in Bryan's country. Bryan at
his meeting in Tammany Hall said that if
he was elected President he would not
have Depew coming to Washington to re
mind him of favors and ask tot legisla
tion. Depew was laughing over this re
mark yesterday, and said that he judged
there would be about as much chance of
Bryan distributing favors as of his
doing it.
He intends to leave here next Monday
and co direct to Galesburg. where he will
make an address in commemoration of
the great debate between Lincoln and
Douglas at that spot. Then the next day
he will make a political address in Gales
burg. From there he wi!l go to Chicago,
where he is to speak on Chicago day at the
great Coliseum. He wi.l have a warm re
ception there, especially as Tillman, Alt
geld, Bryan and Watson are booked for
speeches in Chicago on the same day at
various meetings.
Next he will go to Ann Arbor, make an
address there on October 10 and then re
turn home.
Depew said yesterJay: "I expect to find
a huge change of opinion in the West
when 1 get out there. Almost two years
ago 1 made a sceech in Detroit for the
gold standard at a time when the free
coinage sentiment in that country was
most rampant, l was bitterly upbraided
for tbis, but each time I have gone West
s-iuce I bave found a gradual but sure
change of opinion. 4 here is not so much
of the sentiment out there now as there
was. The bottom has fallen out of Bryan's
boom. The end is written, and the t:c
tory of McKinley wiil be so telling, so
effective, so overwhelming, that Bryanisra
will be blotted off the face of the earth
and annihilated for ail time."
TO STICK OUT THE STRIKE
Union Men Wi.l Not Gd to Work at
Leadville, but Several Mines
Will Soon Be in Operation.
LE A.DVILLE. Colo., Oct. Lâ As already i
stated in these dispatches it is evident the |
Miners' Union has decided to take the ad-
Tice given them by Edward Boyce to ttick
cut the strike. As a result a number of
mine managers will gradually start up i
operations with as many men as they can
secure until the strike is declared off.
The mo?t important step in this arrange
ment is the announcement by the man
agers of the Ibex, Resurrection, Bison and I
Mapala mining companies that they in
tend to resume. None of these properties
accede the demands of the union, but the
managers state they are securing enough
men to run their mines. At all these
properties cleaning up and preparatory
work has been commenced. This com
bination can furnish employment to 600
men.

WILLIAM J, BRYAN
IN WEST VIRGINIA
Wheeling Celebrates the Ar
rival of the Silver
Candidate.
SOME OHIO MEN THEBE.
Many Persons Turn Out to See
and Hear the Orator
From Nebraska
PICKPOCKETS YET WORRY HIM
Photograph F..kers Also J:in the Crowd
That Accompanies ths Traveling
Aggregation.
WHEELING, W. Va.. Oct. Lâ William
J. Bryan has reason to feel proud of the
reception he received here to-night.
Wheeling celebrated his presence with
vigorous enthusiasm. Ohio' joined "with
West Virginia in the demonstration. From
Steubenville came many excursionists, in
cluding the members of two free . silver
clubs. One of these organizations was
called the Republican Free Silver Club
and claimed 400 men in line. Fittsburg,
Fa., sent 100 persona. A farmers' delega
tion marched in from St. Clairs viile, Ohio,
ten miles away, gathering recruits as they
neared Wheeling. The -vast throngs on
the streets when Mr. Bryan reached
Wheeling on a special train, accompanied
by Governor McCorkle, John T. SlcGraw,
National Committeeman, and other prom
inent West Virginian?, was unprecedent
ed in the history of the town. How many
were in the crowd along the sidewalks is
impossible of estimation, but an idea of
its si^e may be gained | from the statement
that passage was . almost impossible to
pedestrians, for over a dozen blocks. . The
parade was highly imposing, with its free
silver clubs in uniform and its troops of
mounted men. All along the way the
enthusiasm was of the heartiest kind.
The speaking took place on Wheeling
Island, in the Ohio River, and its four
Dridge approachesâ two : from thÂ« Ohio
side of the river and the others from
Wheelingâ were .put to their utmost ca
pacity. At 4 o'clock the grand stand on
the island, said to hold 80>X> people, was
nearly full, and the assemblage increased
in size until the time Mr. Bryan arrived
there, and the crowd had become a re
markable one in point of numbers com
posing it. Estimates of its siza run as
high as 30,000, and it is claimed that 40,000
people were on the streets.
Mr. Bryan was cheered wildly when he
was introduced by Paul Reymarm. a
Democrat of local prominence. He con
cluded at 9:15 o'clock and at midnight his
train left for Charleston, where he is \to
speak to-morrow, .â¢
; Mr. Brvan left Graftdn on his special at
9:30 o'clock this morning and arrived at
Clarksburg an hour later. He spent the
night at Grafton at the residence of J. T.
McGraw, National Committeeman from
this State, and manaeed to get a good
rest. Mr. , Bryan bad a narrow escape
from being robbed of his sleep. Two
photograph fakers were taken into custody
at Grafton on suspicion of being connected
with the gang of pickpockets following the
Bryan party. ..
One of them said he had presented a
letter of introduction to Mr. Bryan and
wanted the candidate summoned to iden
tify him. The hearing lasted until 4
a. m. At that time it was decided that if
Mr. Bryan were detained as a witness his
West Virginia schedule would be disar
ranged, and the men were set free.
Mr. Bryan and his party took breakfast
at the Traders' Hotel. Despite the con
tinued bad weather, mere was a big crowd
in the street. The candidate was per
suaded while at the hotel to make his ap
pearance on the balcony, where he matte a
short speech to 600 people. He was then
driven to the fair grounds, where he de
livered a longer address to a larger audi
ence. â '.'.".'â â .:
At the Traders' Hotel Mr. Bryan said:
* i T- â â  i â iMpnffii mi i ii - i y vmm *- â¢ w "**â ! "'*'â¢?.
lam not going to make a speech here, be
cause I believe I nave an appointment at the
fair grounds, and we must hasten oat there in
order to catch the next train; and then, as the
people are not in good financial condition, it
is not an easy thing tor them to come all the
war to Nebraska in special cars to rail on me.
[Applause.] As they, are not able to get oat
there, I am' reversing the process and coming
to see the people. , [Applause.] ,"
* At the fair grounds Mr. Bryan said in
part:
I want to quote to too, not from Democratic
authority, bat from what the great leader, the
Republican candidate for President, said six
years ago in regard to the necessity for an in
creasing circulation. You will tine! in his let
ter of acceptance of this year this statement:
"It is not more money we want. What we
want is to put the money we already have at
work." Now remember, my friends", that
these words .were uttered at a time when the
circulating medium had fallen off 150,000,
--000 in two years. Let me compare that with
what' he said six year* ago, when instead of
having a decreasing volume of currency, we
had an Increase of about $84,000,000 every
year. At that time they were trying to sub
stitute the Sherman law for the Bland-Allison
act. " -â ; â¢. , ; ,;- , -: , .... ' .. -' â â  â  â  ,:
My friends, what change has taken place in
the - lest six years ? Then he desired to in
crease the amount of money in circulation
and now he believes that all you have to do is
to have confidence; that you have enough
and you will never notice this lots. [Ap
plause.] My, friends, the Republican platform
upon which the candidate stands declares in
favor of the maintenance of a gold standard
until the leading commercial nations of the
world join us in abandoning it. Let me & read
you wuat the Republican candidate said six
years ago in the discussion of the Sherman
bill: "I am for the largest use of Mlver in the
currency of the country. I would not dis
honor it; I would sire it equal credit with
gold; I would make no discrimination.* I
would utilize both metals as money and dis
credit neither. I want the double standard
and I believe confidence will accomplish this
purpose." He wanted the double standard
then; he wants the gold standard now. What
change has taken place {Cheers.] If the
double standard was good six years ago it is
good now. [Cries ot â¦'Good and applause.]
Att 11:30 the special train pulled out for
Parkersbnrg, where the largest assemblage
of people Parkersburg has ever known
heard him deliver an address at Stephens
Grove. Excursion trains brougnt in great
crowds from near-by places.
From Washington County, Ohio, the
railroads and steamships carried more than
3000 and perhaps 5000 people, and from
elsewhere in Major McKinley's State large
contingents came. A big parade had to
be abandoned on account of the muddy
condition of the streets. Mr. Bryan pro
ceeded directly from bis train to Stephens
Grove, wuere fully 15,000 people gathered
in an uncomfortable drizzle and cheered
him wildly. Governor William McCorkte
of West Virginia and General Warner of
Ohio, president of the National Bimetallic
League, had made speeches before the
candidate arrived. Judge -McClure, for
merly of the Court of Common .fleas, pre
sided at the meeting and introduced Mr.
Bryan, who spoke for some time on the
money question.
Mr. Bryan recited his oft-quoted extract
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1896.
] from John G. Carlisle's speech oi 1378
i about the emancipation of the industrial
I classes from syndicates, etc., and after
J commenting on it in substantially the
laneuage used by him before proceeded as
follows:
My friends, you must not believe what you
sometimes see iv the papers that I am about to
give up. lam not. If you wifl let me do this
work by degrees, and not compel me to at
tempt too much, I will promise to keep it up
until the eveniug before election and on the
last day have in Nebraska the only meeting
that 1 expect to nave in that State before elec
tion day.
At 4:30 o'clock Mr. Bryan left Parkers
burj; over the Ohio River Railroad tracks
in another special train provided by the
Wheeling committee. The trip along the
banks of the Ohio River between Parkers
burg and Wheeling was marked by dem
onstrations at Sistersville and New Mar
ti nsville, the only stops made. At Sisters
ville the crowd at tht station numbered at
least 2000 people. Th. y cheered vigor
ously when Mr. Bryan appeared on the
back platform, and when the regulation
brass band had finished playing he made
a short speech which contained nothing
new. The gathering at New Martinsville
was composed ot about 1500. They showed
considerable enthusiasm.
BRYAN WILL ACCEPT.
Complete* a Letter to the Populists Who
>ominated Him.
WHEELING, W. Va., Oct. I.â Mr.
Bryan has finished tbe preparation of his
letter accepting the Populist nomination.
It will probably be made public in St.
Louis.
Colonel Fitzgerald, the Populist candi
date for Governor of this State, who had
his pocket picked of $60 at Cumberland
yesterday, lost all the rest of his money to
the lioht-tingered gentry last night while
he was piloting Mr. Bryan through tbe
crowd at Grafton. Two picture fakirs who
were arrested on suspicion at Grafton were
confronted by Colonel Fitzgerald in the
Mayor's office there. Colonel Fitzgerald
was once a professor of phrenology, and,
after an examination of the heaus of the
suspects, he pronounced them both nat
ural-born thieves and accused them of the
theft of his money. He could not pro
duce more substantial evidence, however,
and they were released on their persouai
recognizance.
PUT THE PROGRAMME THROUGH.
Mew York Fopulist* Meet to Complete \
Fusion II ir/* Democrat*.
SYRACUSE, N. V., Oct. I.â Twenty
Populists responded io-day to the call for
a second convention to revise the work of
the former convention. At that conven
tion Bryan and Watson electors were
named and also a full State ticket. These
men were named with the understanding
that they would place their resignations
in toe hands of the State Committee, to
be used if fusion with the Democrats can
be arranged at the Buffalo convention.
The committee sent to Buffalo received
no recognition, but according to the Pop
ulist leaders who are here William P. St.
John, treasurer of the Democratic party,
has given assurance that iusion will t>e
made on Congressmen in several districts,
providing the Democratic electors and
State ticket were indorsed.
The convention was reconvened to carry
out th'S programme. Ail who came went
into executive session as a State commit
tee and at some time during the proceed- j
ings they resolved themselves into a con
vention.
The constitution of the People's party
was amended so as to allow fusion to be
made. Then it was found that Candidate .
Lincoln had not resigned as reported, j
This was overcome, however, by ignoring ;
tbe action of the former convention for i
the reason that its officers bad never been
sworo and it was thereiore declared
illegal.
Chairman Fero and Secretary McParly
were sworn in and Bryan and Sewall elec
tors were indorsed "without opposition. !
When it came to indorsing Porter and
Schraub, tne Democratic candidates for
Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, there
was some objection, but it was overcome
and the programme went through.

Policarpio Lujan, Abelardo Ferrera and

Red Cross Society to collect funds and
medical supplies for the relief of the sick
and wounded in the .^qiish army.
The news of their has caused
considerable surprise ia^Guban circles. It
is only a week, the Cubans say, since
General Weyler, wishing to deprive the
patriot army of all resources for caring for
their sick, forbade the taking of any med
icines out of tbe city without a permit
issued by tbe Spanish military authori
ties.
The Spanish official reports of the war
often refer to the destruction by their
troops of Cuba:: hospitals, and they almost
consider such outrages as signal victories.
Under these circum.^tances tbe Cubans do
not believe that the American people will
give their support to the Spanish Red Cross
Society unless it pledges itself to care for
the sufferers in the Cuban army.
TALKS ABOUT DINAMITERS.
Ex- Secretary Asquith Denies the Stories
of Ft in on Cruelties.
LONDON, Exo., Oct Lâ The RigntHon.
; Herbert Asquitb, who was Home Secre*
tary in Lord Rosabery's Cabinet, made a
1 speech to-night at Leven, Scotland.
During the course of his remarks he re
j ferred to the recent release of the dyna
miters, Daly, Whitehead and Gallagher,
whose cases had come before him while he
was Home Secretary, but whose release he
refused to consent to.
He said he accepted the Government's
statement that the dynamiters bad
been liberated solely on account of
I their bad health, but. speaking
| with the fullest knowledge and |
sense of responsibility, he emphatically I
deniec- that they had been treated in j
pnson with exceptional severity. More
over, when he quitted office there was no I
ground, according to the rules governing
the exercise of clemency, then justifying
the liberation of the dynamiters.
The Auttrian lieichsrath.
VIENNA, ArsTRiA. Oct. Lâ The Reichs
rath resumed its sittings to-day. Dr. yon
Belindki, Minister of Finance, in pre
senting the budget astonished the House
by declaring that all the estimates of for
mer years had been unreal and were cal
culated to deceive Parliament. An aver
age for the last five years shows the ex
penditures had exceeded the estimates
more than 22,000.000 florins. The budget
was illusory in other respects. Dr. yon
Be'indki stated that he proposed to estab
lish a separate investment budget to be
covered by special rentes. He estimated

tee three torpedo-boats which have for
several months been under construction
at the Columbian Iron Works for the
United States navy was launched this
afternoon in thepresenca of a large crowd.

her consorts. She was required to attain
a speed of 24 1 2 ' knots an hour and maintain
that pace for two consecutive hours.
Should she be unable to do it the build
ers must pay a penalty. No premium,

the Columbian company. No. 3, when
completed, will cost about $100,000.

ESCAPE OF A BIGAMIST,
Permitted to Depart With His
Lawyer After Arraignment
in Court.
Although Married Several Times Wil
i:am B. Thompson Was Prepar
ing to Wed Again.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. I.â Great con
sternation was created in the Center-street
Police Court yesterday when it became
known that William B. Thompson, an al
leged bigamist, arraigned during the
morning and paroled in the custody of
his counsel, F, H. Gray, until 3 o'clock,
when he was to appear and furnish bail of
$1000, had escaped from the man placed in
charge of him. At 5 o'clock a general
alarm was sent out for the alleged biga
mist's arrest.
Thompson was arrested upon the com
plaint of Mrs. May Irving Pierson, who, if
the result of her investigation is correct, is
the sixth wife of Thompson. The warrant
for Thompson's arrest was issued in the
Center-street court Tuesday afternoon and
placed in the hands of Detective O'Connor
of the court squad to execute. O'Connor
was informed that it was Thompson's in
tention to be married that night to Miss
Emma Ortb, the daughter of his landlady,
at the latter's residence, 1138 Jefferson
avenue, Brooklyn.
Deteciivs O'Connor says that while there
was no evidence of a wedding about to
take place, Miss Orth, who is fine looking
and 30 years old, hysterically accused
Thompson of deceiving her and ruining
her life when the warrant was served.
Thompson was brought to New York
late Tuesday night and locked up m the
Tombs. Yesterday morning Thompson
was before Magistrate Wentworth in the
Center-street Police Court. MLt. Gray, his
counsel, stated that his client was not
ready for an examination, and requested
that he be paroled in his custody in order
that he might secure a bondsman. He
promised the magistrate that Thompson
should be kept in the custody of a man
from his office. Magistrate Wentworth
granted his request.
With his counsel, Thompson left the
court. His wife entered the court and said
to the magistrate : "I tell you this man
will run away if you do not put him under
Donds." The magistrate replied: "You
attend to your own business and I will at
tend to mine."
Thompson did not put in an apperance
at 3 o'clock. An hour passed and then the
magistrate grew anxious and sent Detect
ive O'Connor out to see if he could find
Mr. Gray. The detective returned and
said be could not find him. In a few
minutes Mr. Gray entered the courtroom
accompanied by a man who said his name
was Feioubet. Magistrate Wentworth
was mortified when he was told that
Thompson had escaped.
Gray, Peloubet, Assistant District At
torney Battle and the magistrate held a
consultation for half an hour. Battle said
subsequently that Thompson would prob
ably be in court this morning.
Miss Orth said last night: "Thompson,
when I first met him in February last,
and to whom I became engaged at Easter,
always represented himself to me as a
single man. When I told him that I
heard that he was married he always de
nied it. The day for our weddind was
changed many times, the last date being
September 29. Before that day came an
other change was made. Thompson
called here this afternoon with his lawyer
to secure a small box belonging to him.
He had nothing to say to me and went
away as soon as possible."

CARS AND CREW;
MIXED TOGETHER
Fatal Wreck of a Freight
Train on the Baltimore
and Ohio.
ALL HANDS ARE KILLED
While Running at a Terrific
Speed the Cars Jump
the Track.
TERRIBLE SCENE PRESENTED
Wedged Among the Wreckaga Wen
the Kangled Bodies of Trainmen
and Two Tramps.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Oct Lâ A disastrous
freight wreck occurred near Filson sta
tion, on the Baltimore and Ohio road,
early this morning. The entire train
crew, consisting of engineer, fireman, con
ductor, two brakemen and flagman, and
two tramps were killed. Thiity-Jour cars
loaded with coal, together with the engine
and caboose, were piled up on the track
and traffic is entirely suspended.
The train left the track on a sharp curve
at the foot of a long, steep grade. Tbe
grade on this part of the road is the heav
iest anywhere on the system. For seven
teen miles tbe track steadily descends at
the rate of 125 feet to tbe mile.
The train was a heavy one and evi
dently got beyond the control of tbe
crew. It was running at a terrific rate
as it reached the bottom of the grade and
struck the sharp curve at that place.
Almost as soon as it struck the curve
the engine left tbe track and the whole
train followed and piled up in a tangled
mass in the cut through which the curve
ran.
When daylight came, so that the wreck
could be seen, it was found to present a
remarkable sight.
The engine, the caboose and tbe thirty
four cars were piled together in inextrica
ble confusion and smashed almost out of
resemblance to cars, while over every
thing the coal was scattered.
vV edged between two of the cars and
crushed into a shapeless mass were the
bodies of two tramps who had evidently
been stealing a ride. The bodies of the
trainmen have not yet been found and
are undoubtedly buried deeply in the
wreck. They will not be reached until
the wreckage has been cleared away,
something that will take many hours of
hard work.
PRESENTS TO JOCKEYS
One Practice That the New
York Club Is Determined
to Suppress.
President Belmont Warns All the
Riders at Gravesend to Be
Careful.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. Lâ Mr. Bel
raont, president of the Jockey Club, is the
first officer of that body to break silence
with reference to the recent findings con
cerning irregular practices.
Jockey Martin has admitted his case,
but there was some curiosity as to why
Jockey Coylie should have been sus
pended. When asked about it to-day Mr.
Belmont said:
"Coylie has been disciplined for bet
ting. It is true the amount he bet was
insignificant, but he is a young lad, and it
was deemed important to teach him at
the outset of his career that no rule of a
jockey club is a dead letter."
It was suggested to Mr. Belmont that
reference was made in the finding of the
stewards to matters that may come before
the State racing committee.
As to the matter of giving presents to
jockeys for any reason, the jockey ciub
means to stamp it out. In some quarters
there is a disposition to consider that the
motive actuating the persons giving the
presents is what governs. The jockey
ciub means to stand by the principle in
volved.
Just after the race at Gravesend to-day
Mr. Belmont called all the jockeys at the
track before him and warned them that if
they were caught with plungers about the
paddock tney would be peremptorily
ruled off all jockey club tracks, no matter
what they might be talking about.

the riders, carrying hoops, rods and bars
in many shapes and to which were at
tached numerous lanterns. The jingling
cow bells and horns were in evidence at
intervals all along the long line. A score
of banners proclaimed the united senti
ment of wheelmen everywhere saying,
"We want good roads."

THE SALT LAKE RAILROAD.
Constantly Growiny Sentiment in favor
of the I? a* We Project.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. I.â The sen
timent in favor of tue Salt Lake railroad
is constantly growin.'. The project, upon
investigation, has been found so feasible
and promises such splendid results not
only for this city, but for the projectors,
that it now looks as if there were to be an
actual contest between two great railway
byeusms, the Santa Fe and the Union
Pacific, as to which one shall father the
enterprise and guarantee its speedy con
struction. As is well known, the Atlantic
anrt Pacific section of the Santa Fe system
to practically tied to the Southern Pacific.
This division extends from Mojave to
Albuquerque.
The Southern California lines, indepÂ»n
opnt of the Southern Pacific, connects
with the Atlantic and Pacific at Barstow.
lhe Santa Fe. being on amicable terms
with the Rio Grande Western, could rench
Los Anpeles over its connections, viz.:
tne Colorado Midland from Denvar to
Grand Junction, thence over the Rio
Grande to "Marysviile, Utah, and thence
over the proposed new line to Barstow, a
distance of 450 miles, in which case the
Santa Fe would have anot.er and inde
pendent route into this city free from the
domination of the Southern Pacific of
Kentucky.

MILL VALLEY'S ASSAULT CASE.
Preliminary Examination of W. H. Man
nion and, Eugene Gray. - . .
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Oct. I.â The pre
liminary examination of William H.
Mannion, charged with committing an
assault on E. U. Wormuth some weeks
ago, was held before Judge- Fottrell to
day. James W. Cochrane appeared - for
the defendant and District Attorney E. B.
Martinelli for the people.
Eucene F. Gray, c arged with being an
accessory to the assault, was the first wit
ness. It was expected that he would turn
State's evidence, as he bad made a con
fession to the District Attorney, Sheriff
Harrison and Constable J. W. Maher.
â  When questioned on the witness-stand
to-day he declined to answer any ques
tions put to him, on the ground that he
feared to incriminate himself. In his
previous confession to the three county
officers Gray had implicated Mannion and
had said that his own life was in danger
had he refused to carry out Mann ion's
plans.
Gray, after the examination, was locked
up in the County Jail and put under
$2500 bail. For some time he has had his
liberty, his former emnloyer, McGinn is of
the Transfer saloon, going bail for him.
. District -Attorney Martinelli said last
night that Gray would be tried now on the
charge of assault, and that besides this a
charge of perjury would be entered against
him. The examination will be continued
before Judge Fottrell next Tuesday.
CASE OF MOORE AT NAPA
Mrs. Greenwood's Self-Confessed
Murderer Under Preliminary
Examination.
R?cital of the Ghast y Details of the
Crime by the Husband of the
Victim.
NAPA, Cal., Oct. Lâ The preliminary
examination of William Moore for the
murder of Mrs. Gieenwood is now on
before Judge Bradford in the north
room of the courthouse. Before the
hour of calling court this morning the
room was crowded. When Moore was
. brought in he was the cynosure of all
eyes. Mr. Greenwood was called to the
stand and testified as to what happened
on the 9th day of February. 1891. His tes
timony was substantially as follows:
During the afternoon Mr. Greenwood
had been building some fences. About
half an hour before sundown he returned
to the house and was doing some work
about the yard. Mrs. Greenwood was ab
sent at the time. Soon two men appeared,
one called Carl Schmidt and the other
during the testimony was designated as
the "other man." The two men asked
for work and then for some food. These
ihey were not able to get. The "other
man" then said, " Money is what we
want," and pistols were pointed at Green
wood. Mr. Greenwood was directed
to open the house, which he did. He was
then placed in a chair and tied by Carl
Schmidt. Something from a cup was
given to him by the "other man" to cause
sleep, but Mr. Greenwood would not give
in to the effects and a second dose was ad
ministered.
Mrs. Greenwood then returned home,
and as sne walked upon the porch the
"other man" went out to meet her. She
uttered nn exclamation and began back
ing away. She probably caught her heel
and fell backward, as the sound of a body
falling was heard by Mr. Greenwood. She
soon entered the house, and Mr. Green
wood asked her, "Are you hurt?" and she
replied, "I am very badly hurt." These
were the last words passed between Mr.
Greenwood and his wife. She was then
taken to the bedroom, where ehe was com
pelled to take something from a cup, the
same as Mr. Greenwood. Mr. Greenwood
was then dragged by Schmidt from the
kitchen througii the dinine-room, through
the bedroom and into the hallway. As he
was taken through the bedroom he saw
Mrs. GreenwooJ lying on the bed. After
some rumaginn in the bedroom the men
probably left, as Mr. Greenwood heard a
buggy leaving. Before this it had become
dark and a lamp had been lighted.
Mr. Greenwood after a time was able to
loosen the bands about his feet so as to
crawl into the bedroom. He could get no
reply from his wife. Soon the men re
turned and he was again dragged into the
tiall and received two bullet-wounds
on the left side of the head. A light was
afterward placed to his eye by the men,
but he pretended to be dead and so es
caped further injury. The men went into
the bedroom and Mr. Greenwood beard
the "other man" say "The woman is all
right." After putting out the light the
men left, not to return. It was now nearly
midnight, as Mr. Greenwood soon heard
the clock strike 12. Mr. Greenwood tried
to get up, but tailed, and not until day
iight appeared was he able to crawl into
the bedroom, only to find his wife cold in
death. He opened the door with diffi
culty and walked to the road. A man
soon passed along and assistance was then
summoned.
Mr. Greenwood again tried to identify
Moore as the "othtr man," but could not
swear positively that he was, although
Mr. Greenwood said Moore resembled the
murderer in many respects.
Dr. Haun, who wÂ»s summoned on the
morning of the murder, testified to the
condition of Mrs. Greenwood when he
found her.
This afternoon Mr. Lynch testified as to
the time Moore worked for him. From
September, 1889, up to January 27, 1891,
Moore worked at different times for Lynch.
January 27 Moore Jeft Lvnch's employ,
and from that time Mr. Lynch testified
tnat he did not see Moore until be was
brought rp from Los Angeies. Lynch
fully identified tne prisoner as Moore, the
man who worked for him.
Other witnesses also testified as to the
idejtity of Mooie.
Moore acted as his own lawyer and
freely asked questions of the witnesses.
When Mr. Knox was on the stand Moore
asked him. "What was your opinion of
me when I was working for Mr. Lynch? '
Mr. Knox replied, "You were one of the
nicest men I ever worked wilh."
The examination was continued until
to-morrow morning, at which time Moore
will bring forward his defense.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1896.
SANTA BARBARA'S
NEW STREETCARS
Electricity Takes the Place
of the Old Mule
Power.
THE FIRST CARS RUN.
Great Demonstrations on State
Street as a Fair Girl
Guides the Motor.
AH IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT
Rapid Transit Required to Keep Up
With the March of Progress
at the City of Roses.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. I.â This
has been a memorable day in the history
of Santa Barbara, marking as it does the
inauguration of the fine new electric
street railway system and the passing
away of the mule, which has so long
served as the diligent, patient and exas
perating motor of the streetcar system in
the City uf Roses. An initial ran over the
road was notable for another reason. For
the first time in the history of this coast,
possibly for the first time in the history
of the country, a woman was at the motor,
and tbe first electric-car that glided along
State street, with its gay coat of carmine
and yellow decorations, was guided and
controlled by a woman. She who gained
such distinction to-day is Miss Hattie Mil
ler, the daughter of the president of the
road.
The power-house lies in that scantily
populated region locally known as "Across
the Estrero," a region which easy transit
and swift connection with the town
proper will soon cover with little cottages.
Even this district turned out a goodly
crowd to witness the start, as four cars
decked with flowers pulled out of the
power-house and shot swiftly up the line
in the direction of town. The first of
these cars held the president, with officers
and Stockholders of the road, together
with their familes, the second was occu
pied by city and county officials, the third
by the press and Herr Schuy's band and
the fourth by the Board of Trade.
State street, the fine business avenue of
the city, was lined with throngs of people,
more than turned out to see the circus
last week and almost as many as the
flower festival musters. Business men
left desks and counters, the schools were
all dismissed and every farmer from tbe
surrounding country had come to town
with bis family. Cheer after cheer went
up as the first car came in sight, gliding
over the rails. Cheer after cheer went up
as the crowd saw the slim, pretty, dark
eyed girl alone at the motor, her eyes in
tent on the track ahead, one small hand
on the controller, the other ready to put
on the brake at an instant's notice should
some venturesome urchin stray too near
tbe rails. Beside her was a superb St.
Bernard dog, Zeas by name, christened
after the King of the Gods, her insepara
ble companion, a noble fellow, occupying
bis post of honor in silent dignity and
evidently feeling that upon him devolved
much of the responsibility of tbe occasion.
Car after car was cheered, but the crowd
screamed itself hoarse when it saw trailed
behind tbe press car, an open car, upon
which stood a pair of sad-eyed mules gar
landed with flowers and altogether regard
ing the pageant and throngs of spectators
with looks of sore reproach. Phoenix is a
quaint old white mule wich stubs of ears,
a character embalmed in local history, and
his name indicates his unique expedience
in life.
Twelve years ago tbe stables of the mule
line were" burned to the ground and a
white mule was taken out dead from tne
ashes. He was so very dead that a jury
sat upon him and pronounced him de
funct, and an insurance company paid a
policy of $15 upon his remains). Having
accomplished this masterly financial
stroke for his owners the mule arose,
called for fodder and drink and resumed
his place on the payroll of the company,
faithfully serving the public for ten years
more. So extraordinary a history and
such exceptional service certainly entitled
the animal to recognition. Hence it is
that Phoenix, quaint, garlanded with flow
eiÂ« and furnished with a congenial com
panion, was to-day carried in state along
the line over which he has so many times
hauled the selfish public. And hence it is
that the Daily Independent to-niuht an
nounces that it has bought the faithful
public servant and will pension him for
life upon green pastures watered with liv
ing springs. Precisely why the muies
were trailed behind the presscar was the
subject of anxious inquiry until one ready
wit averred tiiat "tbe company wanted all
the kickers on the same train."
Showers of roses fell on the first car as it
passed up the street and out of sigh',
though the gentle girl at the motor had no
time to spare for gracious nods or re
sponses to the ovation tendered her.
There were hundreds of horses on the
street which their owners had brought out
to accustom them to the unwonted sight,
hundreds of little children and dogs dart
ine back and forth across the rails. It
speaks much for the care and skill exer
cised on all occasions that during all the
day not a single accident has marked the
initiation of the new system. The nearest
approach to one was a break made by a
pair of old mules, who will, for a week to
come, pull cars along a connecting oranch,
and who jumped tbe track at tne sight of
the first motor, dragging their own car
first to one gutter and then, as a down
motor again horrified them, plunging
across the street into another, describing a
<:reat letter S on the pavement.
This has been a gala day for the small
boy, for no fares have been collected, and
all the afternoon the populace has been
enjoying free rides- The liberal spirit in
which the road has been planned and
equipped and opened has done much to
popularize the management. The rolling
stock of the road consists of combination
cars built by the Hammond Car Company
of San Francisco, and equipped with im
proved and up-to-date trucks made by
Dorner <fe Dutton of Cleveland, Ohio, and
which do away with almost all vibration
and jarring.
The motors are manufactured by the
General Electric Company and are com
pletely encased in an iron box to avoid
injury and dirt There are two of
25-horsepower each to each car, thus pro
viding an ample surplus of energy for sur
mounting grades. Each car is furnished
with seven 16-candlepower lamps and
headlights of 32-candlepower each, and in
addition they have oil tanks for emer
gencies. A number of electric-buttons
are conveniently located for passengers to
stop the cars by a slight pressure, notify
ing the motorraan by ringing a bell. This
is a great improvement over tbe old
method of rising and pulling a strap, and
will doubtless be much appreciated. No
expense has Deen spared to have the
finest and safest cars on tbe coast. Con
trollers have been obtained from the
General E ectric Company which bring
the cars perfectly under the control and
are proof against burning out. With
them and the improved lever brakes the
cars can be brougnt to a stop within a few
feet.
The power-house, which is located near
the Southern Pacific freight depot, has a
hundred - kilo watt generator, manu
factured by the General Electric Com
pany and a 165- horsepower high-speed
Ideal engine from the Ide machine-shops
of Bpringneld, 111. The dynamo is of the
multi-polar type, having six poles and
running at a speed of 600 revolutions per
minute. The switch-board was made of
soapstone from Catalina Island by the
General Electric Company and is a beau
tiful and useiul piece of work. The steam
is supplied by boilers made by the Oil City
Boiler Company of Oil City, Pa., there
being two of 150 horsepower each, so
that no stoppage is necessary in case of a
boiler breaking down or needing cleaning.
Tne fuel is to be crude petroleum from
Summerland, Cal., and will be supplied
by H. F. Williams of that place. The rails
are from the Pacific Rolling Mills of San
Francisco, and weigh forty pounds to the
yard, and are laid in a most substantial
manner.
The trolley wire is of hard drawn cop
per and is of an entirely new pattern, a
cross section appearing like an unequal
figure 8. This wire can be fastened to the
insulators in such a manner that there are
no projections to cause sparking as the
trolley wheel passes. A double expense
has been incurred for this wire, as the lot
which was first ordered was lost on the ill
fated Colombia, which went ashore re
cently at Pigeon Point.
Mr. Miller, who is the president of the
road, says that he has procured all
materials possible on the coast and that
prices on electrical supplies here compare
most favorably with those of the East,
many things being actually cheaper here
without regard of cost of ship Ding. All
but three of the employes of the road are
Santa Barbara men and the policy will be
to patronize home industry as much as
possible.
The officers of the Consolidated Electric
Company are: C. W. Miller, president
and manager; H. P. Luster, secretary and
treasurer, and A. P. Miller assistant man
ager. A. Hope Doeg, the former presi
ident, is a prominent stockholder. The
company hoids a iranchise extending
from Carpenteria to La Patera and the
part connecting with Montecito will soon
be in operation. It is the intention of the
company to get the town system complete
at once, and the first efforts in that direc
tion will be toward electrizing the
branches extending to the Mission and
the Plaza del Mar. Probably but little
more work will be done until after the
election, however, when it is expected
that it will be taken up in earnest. The
lines now in operation run from the
County Hospital through the town with
various ramifications and on to the Cot
tage Hospital.
BURNHAM'S DHEARY HOMESTEAD
Selected the Moat Desolate Spot in Ante
lope Valley.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct, I.â A
special officer of the Genoral Land Office,
who is at present in Santa Barbara, tells
an interesting story anent the American
Burnham, who recently signalized him
self by dispatching Mlimo, the old African
witch. This officer was recently sent to
Antelope Valley to cancel a homestead
entry made there some years ago. When
people make homestead entries they com
monly select a fertile piece of land, or one
that at least offers a home site by some
stream or living spring. To his surprise
the land agent found that his descriptions
led him into thÂ« most desolate and for
bidding portion of the Mojave Desert, a
flat, barren, treeless plain, where the only
vegetation was a little scrubby plant grow
ing in the sand wastes.
The guide who conducted him to the
spot, and who is at present the only set
tler in the entire township, stated that
the homesteader had to baul hi* water
when be wan there from a spring ten
miies away. The claim >hanty that had
stood on the quarter section was gone â
either blown away or bnried in sand. No
more desolate or forbidden region could
be imagined. The special agent, who is a
thinker and a student oi character, men
tally decided that the man who had
chosen that barren and desolate tract out
of alt the picturesque and fertile lands in
California open to settlement must either
have been a poet looking for new inspira
tions, a misanthropist hobelessly soured
upon humanity, or a man fleeing from his
brethren. "What sort of a man was this
fellow Burnham, anyhow, and where is he
now?" he asked of his guide. "O ,he was
an odd sort of fellow. He is in Africa
now. I see by the papers he haa been
killing a witch or something of the sort."
The strange loneiy settler in tbe Mojave
Desert who entered a homestead on the
sand wastes ten miles from water was
American Burnham, the man whom all
the world is talking about.
ARCATA' S GLOOM AMELIORATED
The Railroad Company Will Deal Justly
With the Relatives of the Mad
River Bridge Victims.
EUREKA, Cal., Oct. I.â As a result of
tbe recent catastrophe in Hum bboltd t
County, the falling of the bridge which
spans Mad River, seven persons in all lost
their lives, while many others were seri
ously injured, some few perhaps for life.
The gloom which overshadowed Arcata,
where took place the funerals of those
who met their death, has almost disap
peared. Those who survived the disaster
are gradually recovering, while tbe people
of the community in general congratulate
themselves that the loss of life was not far
greater.
To the credit of the Korbel Company be
it said that they intend dealing with the
friends of the dead and injured justly and
houorably without litigation. The com
pany is wealthy and can well stand the
strain on their resources, their railroad
line being one of the best payiug invest
ments in the State. In dealing thus fairl\ r
with the people concerned they will no
doubt maintain tbe confidence of their
former customers and continue to be a
powerful 'actor in the business affairs of
this county.
The bridge is again repaired and the
road in full working order, trains running
on reguiar schedule time. A salutary
effect of this sad affair is the care and at
tention now being given to the other rail
roads in the county to prevent the possi
bility of any injuries of a like nature.

GUNNING FOR
MAYOR PENNOYER
A Portland Woman Essays
to Redress a Labor
Grievance.
SAID TO BE DEMENTED.
She Hires a Hack and Hunts
All Over Town lor the
Executive.
A NEMESIS WITH A RECORD.
Once Shot Into a Crowd for Ridiculing
Her Failure to Kill a
Dog.
PORTLAND, Ok., Oct. I.â Mayor Syl
vester Pennoyer was in danger of being
assassinated last night by Mrs. M. W.
Henderson, a woman of some notoriety in
Portland. Mrs. Henderson claims to be a
niece of Ben Butler and is the divorced
wife of M. W. Henderson, a partner in
the Willamette Iron Works. It appears
that her mind has been unbalanced for
some time through use of spirits and
morphine. Concluding that the people of
Portland desired Pennoyer better dead
than alive, she armed herself with a re
volver and started out as the Mayor's
nemesis. Procuring a carriage she went
to Mayor Pennoyer's residence on West
Park street. After being informed by
Mrs. Pennoyer that her husband was not
at home Mrs. Henderson departed, but
not before the executive's wife had noticed
the woman concealing something under her
wrap. From West Park street the woman
rode to the City Hall, but the Mayor had
departed an hour before. As she left the
City Hall some friends took her in charge.
Some years ago Mrs. Henderson started
out to kill a dog and shot into a crowd of
spectators who laughed at her efforts.
It is alleged that the woman wanted to
avenge the wrong done poor men with
families by removing them from the street
cleaning department. The Mayor has not
caused the woman's arrest.
MAY McMAHON CAPTURED.
The Young Mother Leads the Detectives a
Merry Chase.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. 1. â May Mc-
Mahon, the missing young woman who is
muchly wanted in the Melcher conspiracy
case, and who led four Portland detectives
a merry chase in the mountains, eluding
capture since Monday evening, when it
was supposed the girl had been caught at
Stafford, was found to-day and brought to
Portland. The girl was pursued to New
berg, and when officers reached there she
could not be found. John Holthous had
the girl in a buggy and drove into the
mountains near Stafford. The weather
was bad, and how the 15-year-old mother
stood the exposure is naturally a wonder.
The detectives searched every bouse and
barn between Tualatin and Stafford and
the only information furnished by the
residents about the fugitives was mislead
ing. They were finally found in the bouse
of John Huff.
Detective Cody says that the girl has
made a most damaging accusation against
Dr. Palmer. She said that she was the
mother of the child claimed by her
mother, Mrs. Jennie Melcher, and that in
its removal Dr. Palmer employed instru
ments. There are now seven people im
plicated in this strange conspiracy case.
The chief conspirator, Mrs. Melcher, still
persists in acting out her version of the
story. May McMahon is under guard at
the hospital.

ment of bills of exchange on banks atCor
vallis, Hillsboro and Eugene. McConnell
defrauded the Knights of Pythias out of
about $3000 and decamped to Rossland,
B. C. McConnell formerly occupied a

f,u<!y Teacher Obtains Damages.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. I.â The trial of

vs. Andrew Henn, one of the Directors of
School District 48, took place in Judge
Shaituck's court yesterday and resulted
in a verdict tor $200 in favor of the plaintiff
to-day. The trouble commenced about a
year aeo, and wan all caused because it
was stated that Miss House, who is an
Englishwoman, told her pupils that
"Barnes' History of the United States"
was a lie, a delusion and a snare, and
otherwise made light of the land of the
free.
NOTES FROM PALO ALTO
Dr. David Starr Jordan Will
Return From His Tour
To-Morrow.
Stanford Day at the Santa Clara Fair.
Students Arranging for a Grand
Concert.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
1. â Mrs. Jordan received word last even
ing that her husband, Dr. David Starr
Jordan, would arrive at the university
next Saturday, having just arrived at Vic
toria. Dr. Jordan, during hiu absence,
has sent the university a large number of
rare marine specimens, some of them en
tirely unknown to science and some of
them very valuable. Dr. Gilbert of the
zoological department says that all these
specimens have been left untouched and
practically unexamined in order that Dr.
Jordan might classify them himself.
Great preparations are being made by
students for a general hegira to San Jose
next Saturday, which has been set apart
as Stanford day at the fair. Througii the
efforts of Treasurer Frank W. Morrison a
special train has been arranged for, which
will return the students to the campus
after tbe grand concert in tbe evening. A
very low round-trip rate has been granted
by the railway company, and from the
present outlook fully 500 students will
spend the day at the fair.
The Stanford first and second elevens
are to play an exhibition game of football
in the morning and th â  Glee and Mando
lin Club will give a grand musical concert
in tbe evening. This is tbe first concert
given this season by the musical club.
Professors Barnes, Ross and Griggs are
getting up a big student excursion and â¢
picnic for Saturday. The objective point
is the crest of Black Mountain in tne
Santa Cruz range, some fifteen miles dis
tant from tbe campus. 'Buses have been
engaged to take about 100 persons to the
foot of the mountain in the morning. The
ascent will be made and lunch eaten on
the peak and the return will be made in
the evening. It is probable that most of
those who do not go to the fair at San Jose
will be in the Black Mountain party.
The executive committee of the Student
Association met last evening to consider
the advisability of giving a grand combi
nation concert on Thanksgiving night
after the big football game. It is the gen
eral desire to have an entertainment that
shall be characteristic in its way and shall
be the entire work of student talent. The
university has a finer and oetter trained
number of musical clubs this year than
ever before, and the idea is growing in
favor that a musicale in which all tbese
clubs should participate would be the
most fitting entertainment devisable. The
band, which will number forty or more
pieces, tbe orchestra, the Glee, Banjo,
Mandolin and Ladies' Mandolin dubs
would be able to render a most enjoyable
and complete programme. The executive
committee failed to make a final decision,
because of tbe estimate of expense likely
to be incurred, but in all probability favor
able action will be taken at the next meet
ing.
There is still a question whether the
freshmen are going to receive their cus
tomary receptioii at the sophomores' hands
or not. The reception had been decided
upon and arrangements were well under
way when it was discovered t at the fac
ulty were utterly opposed to granting the
privilege of any dancing in the gymna
sium whatever. Inasmuch as that was
the place set for the reception and the
reception committee couldn't see how suc
cess would result without dancing, affairs
just now are in statu quo.
The representatives for the McKinley-
Bryan joint debate here have been decided
upon. It will be remembered, as The
Call stated some weeks ago, that the
Bryanites challenged tbe McKinley Club
to a debate, and that the gauntlet thrown
down was promptly taten up by the lie
publicans, ltwasalso stated at the time
that Rose 97 and Sheldon '96 would
probably be chosen to represent the sound
money side, and Morgan '98 would up
hold the cheap-money doctrine. The
fourth debater and the other advocate of
the 50-cent dollar is Snedden '98. The
debate is upon the following question:
"Resolved, That the adoption of a free
silver policy would be for the best interests
of this country. "
WEATERVILLE MURDER CASE.
George H. Barker Is Held for Trial
Hithout Bonds.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Oct. I.â The
preliminary examination of George H.
Barker, accused of murdering a China
man at Junction City, fifteen miies from
Weaverville, on the 26th of August, 1896,
Robert R. Fowler acting as attorney for
the defense, was held before Justice Phil
brook yesterday. The incriminating wit
ness was Robert Powell, a half-breed, who
stated that himself, in company with the
defendant had corns to town in tbe after
noon where both got very drunk, and that
as they were leaving town at about 12
o'clock that night they passed an aged
Chinaman when Barker struck him on
the back of the head with a new ax helve
which he had purchased that day. Bar
ker was about to strike again when Powell
interfered, and then both men went on to
their cabin in the hills, leaving the China
man lying in the road. Before they
reached the cabin Barker stated that he
was sorry that he had committed the act.
Several Chinese witnesses were called,
but their testimony was thrown out, as
they could only speak through an inter
preter and none of them knew~the nature
of an oath. It was noticeable that witness
Powell was extremely agitated while in
the witness chair, and when asked why he
had waited a month before notifying the
officers of the crime said that he was
afraid he would be arrested for complicity.
The defendant was bound over for trial
without bail.

SAN RAFAEL'N ROMANCE.
How the Four Lout Ladies Spent tho
Sight in the Mountains.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Oct. I.â Louis
Hughes, the guide who escorted the four
ladies from the Hotel Rafael yesterday
into the fastnesses of the mountains of
the Bolinas Ridge in the direction of
Camp Taylor, denies emphatically that he
was at any time in doubt as to the right
direction homeward. He says that the
party was making for Dog Canyon, but
the fog came down so densely and so sud
denly that he feared the ladies would be
unequal to the ride over the trails toward
home in the uncertain light. Conse
quently, after a consultation, all agreed
to camp under the redwoods until day
break. A rousing campfire was started,
and with Beats made from the saddles the
party comfortably passed through the
night awaiting the light that would make
it possible for their return homeward.
All of the party, searchers as well as
searched, have arrived home. The ladies
declare the experience was charmingly
romantic, and that they "would not have
missed it for the world. 5 '

Matter Ilodey's record has already been
vut in pnnt. It will be remembered that
although hardly past infancy and short

oi a man. He not only has the external
resemblance, but as was demonstrated to
night he think? quite sensibly on the leau
uig questions of the day.
Chairman Robert Fnriong led the prcn!
ipy before the audience and introduced
Vim as the youngest political speaker in
the United States. Ihe boy made a slow
and stately bow, looked over the throng
and when he spoke tbe strength of his
utterance made everybody start involun
tarily, He could easily be understood at
the remotest corner of tbe hall.
"I am pleased to come before you, ladies
and gentlemen," he said, "to address you
on the only straight issue before the
American people. Four years ago," he
continued, after the applause had ceased,
"the Democrats came into power. They
promised us great things. Did we get
them. Yes, in the back of the neefc."
As he said this he made an appropriate
gesture, slapping the back of his own neck
with a resonndiCir smack.
"Gentlemen," said he, "we want protec
tion, so that the r oor man can support
his dear family.'
At this time tiie applause was so insist
tent and loud that Master Kodey had to
stop talking for a while. Afterward, in
stead of losing bis head, he continued,
just lifee any other grown-up speaker
would do: "Ladies and gentlemen, one
thing more; don't forget Mr. Cauavan for
the Assembly, the workingman's friend."
When be had finished be bowed and took
his seat, and Mr. Van Duzer, the next
speaker. shooK liands with him, offering
congratulations, all of which Master Rodey
accepted as an ordinary interchange of
courtesy between two gentlemen.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. I.â The Board of
SujÂ»erviÂ«ors has received a long tirade
against woman suffrage from John Atkin
son of St. Louis, Mo. In his letter he
urges the voters to work against the elev

grievances would be speedily redressed by
meVsnres so extreme and unreasonable as
to cause antagonism and hate, if not
worse, between the sexes.
The board refused to listen to the rend

KIDNAPING CASE
AT SACRAMENTO
Red Bluff Highbinders Get
Away With a Rich
Prize.
AH LIN IS THE VICTIM.
And She Is Reputed to Be Worth
Several Thousand
Dollars.
CHINATOWN IN WILD DISMAY
The Law Has Been Invoked and Every
Effort Will Bs Made for
Her Rescue.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. Lâ Just be
fore the departure of the Red Bluff train
from this city to-night, Constable Spinks
of Sacramento and Constable Rodgers of
Red Bluff, accompanied by several depu
ties, entered Chinatown with a hack mid
arrested a Chinese woman named Ah Lin
on a charge of grand larceny sworn to by a
Red Bluff highbinder named Ah Lee.
The officers were accompanied by a
Celestial from Red Bluff who pointed out
tbe woman wanted, and the officers seized
hei and attempted to place her in the
hack and succeeded after a desperate sug
gle, during which she smashed all the
glass out ot the vehicle and severely
scarred the faces of the officers with a
woman's weapons, ber nails.
Her screams aroused the entire inhabi
tants of the Celestial quarters, who rushed
to arm themselves, but before they could
offer any decided opposition the woman
was pone.
It is claimed that although tbe warrant
was straight enough, it is a pure case of
kidnaping, and the law is being used sim
ply as a tool to procure possession of Ah
Lin by a highbinder society of Red Bluff.
"Ah Lin has never been outside of this
city for nearly five years," states a promi
nent Chinese official, "and this charge of
errand larceny has been trumped up to se
cure possession of her, because she owns
several thousand dollars and is talking of
returning to China.
"But their scheme will never succeed, as
we have telegraphed the Sheriff at Red
Bluff to meet the train and take the
woman directly into his custody and have
sent one of our company along to see that
this is done. We have also secured the
services of a lawyer, who will go up on
the first train."
In the meantime, Chinatown is stirred
to its depths, and all manner of threats
are being made against the Celestials of
Red Rluff by the local tongs. The Red
BluS Chinaman who accompanied the
officers h&s been arrested on a charge of
abduction and locked up, and bis life will
not be worth a rushlight should he be
turned at liberty to-morrow.

THE STRANDED UMATILLA.
Captain Goodall Visits the Vessel and
Thinks There Is a Good Chance
to Save Her.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. I.â Captain C.
M. Goodall of Goodall, Perkins & Co.,
agents of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company, accompanied by R. B. Hooper,
average insurance adjuster, arrived in Se
attle this evening from San Francisco and
with J. F. Trowbridge, local superinten
dent of the steamship company, who re
turned from Port Townsend to-day, left
on tbe steamer Rosalie for the scene of
the Umatilla wreck. Moran Bros., ship
builders, have also proceeded to Port Town
send, with two of their 13-inch pumps, by
means of which they hope to remove the
water from the vessel.
Trowbridge says the hole in the Uma
tilla's bottom is on tbe starboard side and
near amidships, but Diver Benjamin had
not, as far as be had been advised, defi
nitely located tbe injury.
The vessel, Mr. Trowbridge stated, has a
very valuable cargo aboard, none of which,
with the exception of some perishable
freight, was saved.
She had considerable sugar and a large
amount of California canned goods con
signed to parties at Delogoa Bay, South
Africa. At low tide the stern of the ves
sel lies in four fathoms of water and is
almost submerged at high tide. She is,
Superintendent Trowbridee claims, on
good bottom and in no danger of break
ing to pieces save through the agency of
extremely bad weather.
Her repairs, in case she is floated safely,
Mr. Trowbridge thinks, will be made at
either Quartermaster harbor or the dry
docks near Tacoma or at Victoria, and in
the event that the work cannot be done at
either of these docks, she will, no doubt,
be taken to the Government dry-dock at
Port Orchard.
Receiver C. J. Smith of the Oregon Im
provement Company, which concern owns
the vessel, stated to-day that the Umatilla
was insured for over $200,000.

GOLD-HUNTING IN
THE NORTHWEST
Alexander Begg on the Ac
tivity of the Mines of
British Columbia.
The Finding of Curious Nug
gets and Bits of Stray
Quartz.
QUEER HISTORY OF ROSSLAND
San Francisco the Place to Which
the Miners Look for Supplies
of All Kinds.
Alexander Becg, publisher of the Brit
ish Columbia Mining Record, Victoria
and Vancouver, is among the arrivals at
the Baldwin. Mr. Begs is an old newspa
per man. He has lately completed a
voluminous history of the Northwest,
which engaged his attention for two years.
Mr. Begg says that there is enormous
activity in the mining districts of the
Northwest in the Cariboo, Slocan, Trail
Creek, East Kootenay and other districts
of British Columbia. There [has been
lately a Heavy product of gold, towns have
sprung up and the liveliest kind of activ
ity has been noticeable on every hand.
Mr. Begg has personally visited most of
these districts and spent considerable time
there. He says Sau Francisco ought to
pay attention to thesedlstricts, for there is
a lot of business to be got there. He Bays
Alexander Begg, Who Has Re
cently Game From the Northern
Gold Diggings.
[Sketchtd from life by a "Call" artitt.]
it is a great field for mining machinery,
ttie machinery can be taken in free of duty
and the people there all look to San Fran
cisco as the best place in whicn to buy it.
"The mining prospects in British Co
lumbia," said he, "surpass anything con
templated a few months ago. Prospectors
by thousands have goue to the new dis
tricts. The past season has been one of
development more than actual production.
Near Eossland there are at present twelve
mines that may be called shippers. These
are the Le Roy, War Eagle, Iron Mask,
O. X.. Cliff, Josie, Poorman. Crown Point,
Nickel Plate, Kootenay and Columbia,
Center Star and Jambo. In addition to
these there are ten probable shippers in
1897.
"In point of fact, however, the lack of ;
transportation facilities has prevented the
ore from ; being Â£ shipped, and ;in conse
quence large quantities are on tbe dumps
awaiting the advent of the new railroads.
The Red , Mountain Railway, or as it is
familiarly known Corbiu'a road, will be in
Rossland during October. The Columbia
and Western is now built from Rossland
to Trail and will extend its line immedi
ately, and > the Crow's Nest Pass Railway
will be built before a year, so that in the
immediate future . the i shipment of " ore
'from that district will be immense.
"At Trail, on the Columbia River, a
number of immense deposits similar to
those near Rossland have been discovered
and development is going on. All up the
Columbia River ' new camps \ are ; being
formed and fresh discoveries constantly
made, and before another summer there
will be numerous mining towns along that
river. "'_â , ' r . '/ . : .";:' '1 ." :.".'". ,\ "
"It is simply astonishing the amount of
activity that is going on. â¢ Â ' : .
"Another district which' promises great
results is that of Boundary Creek. ; It is
the opinion 'of practical men that it
abounds with great mines, and the surface
indications are certainly wonderful.
When the Columbia and Western Rail
road gets in there I expect to see a boom
in mining that will astonish people.
There are other districte near here, . such
as Salmon River and others. . ;, r ,
.V.We â  not only ; have gold ; but ?we have
great silver mines. The Slocan and Lar
uian Duncan districts are both chiefly

ful mines in operation, the - principal be
ing the â -: Slocan : ' Star, . which this year
has paid its shareholder; $250,000 in divi
dend! on a capital of $500,000. There are
several other silver mines developing into
large properties, : and ", any - number of
smaller enterprises â  being worked * by men
of â¢; small? capital. " One feature ,of -i the
Slocan district is that even if silver goes
below what it is at present it will pay to
mine it, the ores being so rich. .
:'...: "East ; Kootenay mines are chiefly low
grade, but the deposits are immense and
the ore of ranch greater valne than the
great mines of Alaska, which are paying
their shareholders so handsomely. .

"Then there is the Big Bend country,

I saw only a few days before 1 left some
splendid nuggets, some of them worth
from $40 to $50 each.
"On Vancouver Island at Alberin and
other points active mining is being carried
on. But the island has only been partially
prospected. The indications are, However,

The finest coal found on the Pacific Coast
is on Vancouver Island and there are also
immense deposits of iron ore.
"You in California have had a wonder
ful experience in the past and your State
is yet immensely rich in mines, but do
not be surprised if your record is eclipsed
within the next year or two by British
Columbia.
"I was surprised at the great manufac
turing facilities enjoyed by San Francisno,
and I think certainly your mining-machin
t-ry men and your merchants dealing in
mining supplies should give attention at
once to tbe great district io tbe north of
you. Your city is particularly well situ
ated in the matter of freight to send in
supplies to us. Your factories and
machine-shops are large enough to com
pete with the East. Why, then, don't you
men net in on the ground floor and secure
trade which otherwise will be lost to your
City?
"Mining machinery is admitted free
from the United States so long as it is not
similar to what is made in Canada. Now
very little of your machinery here is like
anything made in Canada, so customs
duty does not stand in your way. I think,
and have in fact all along thought, that San
Francisco is a specially good supply mart
for our country. Southern Kootenay
owes much to American capital in its de
velopment, and we are not the people to
deny it, but we have wakened up to the
fact that we have one of the richest min
ing countries in the world, and while
Americans led the way we are not slow
and the Canadian people are becoming
greatly interested in our mining develop
ment.
"It is worth while for San Francisco to
keep an eye on British Columbia.''
IMPALED ON A PIPE,
Horrible Accident to a Passen
ger on a Mission-Street
Car.
Arthur Mils Probably Fatally
Injured by a Piece of
Carelessness-
A serious accident, which may prove
fatal to at least one man, occurred on
Mission street, between Sixth and Seventh,
early last evening.
A Mission-street car was going west,
when it slowed up because of a wagon
loaded with water pipes, which refused to
leave tbe track ahead. The driver of the
wagon just ahead of the car would not
turn out.
The car was approaching, and
as a result the dashboard of tbe car struck
the ends of the pipes reaching over the
back of tbe wagon.
Arthur Mills was sitting on the front of
the car. and as the car struck the pipes
one of them was driven into his abdomen,
inflicting a wound which will probably
prove fatal.
Another man, named Jones, was struck
by another of the pipes. His clothes were
torn into fragments and he was painfully
injured.
Dr. W. C. Stratton attended the injured
men. Four more men were on the car
and they too were more or less injured.
Mills lives at 707 Shotwell street, where
he was taken after his injuries were at
tended to.

Mariage in Borneo.
The marriage ceremony practiced by tbe
people of Borneo is short and simple.
Bride and groom are brought before the
assembled tribe with great solemnity and
seeted side by side. A beiel-nut is 'then
cut in two by the medicine woman of the
tribe, and one-half is given to the bride
and the other half to the groom. They
begin to chew the nnt, and then the old
woman, after some sort of incantation,
knocks their heads together and they are
declared husband and wife.
Bees vi. Pigeons.
An apicultnrist of Westphalia made a
bet that twelve bees, released at a distance
of three miles from the hives at the same
time as twelve pigeons, would travel over
the ground as quickly as the birds. The
first bee entered the hive one quarter of a
minute before the hrst pigeon reached its
columbary. Three other bees arrived
before the second pigeon, and the re

FACTOEIES MUST BE OPENED.
The Drill Corps Escorted Speakers
From the County Commit
tee Rooms.
The Phoenix Club Drill Corps appeared
in its new uniform last night and es
corted Hon. J. C. Campbell from the Re
publican County Committee rooms, 850
Market street, to Scottish Hal), the club's
heat quarters". The corps was preceded by
a brass band and received many compli
ments on its attractive appearance.
The meeting was opened before the arri
val of the corps by Andrew Branch, who
en-ertained the crowded hall with a few
r remark* brimful of patriotism.
George Hunter sang "Sweet Silver Bells
of Memory." It was not a political silver
song, but 'twas sentimental, the silver be
ing in the form of notes.
M. M. Barnctt, after a pleasant reference
to the departure ot the drill corps to escort
J. C. Campbell to the hall, made an ad
dress on "Protection." During the past
six years the value of imports into the
United States, he said, was sufficient to
pay the National debt.
Mr. Barnett interspersed his remarks
with many humorous anecdotes in dialect.
The speaker congratulated his hearers
on the fact that harmony prevailed in the
ranks of the local Republican party, and
complimented the State Central Commit
tee for its action in Having recognized
the true Republican pnrty of this City.
He urjred the election of the Republican
legislative ticket in order that California
runrbt be represented in the United States
tie by a man who could properly rep
resent California and of whom they need
not be ashamed.
Messrs'. Clark, Mendell and White filled
up the time with humorous dialogues and
songs.
Here the drill corps, sixty strong,
headed by a brass band, hied into the hall
under command of Captain O'Neill, and
escorting the speaker of the evening,
Joseph 1 C. Campbell and S. Shaben, nomi
nee for Public Administrator; William
Deane, nominee for Auditor; George W.
E der, nominee for Superintendent of
btreets, and Justice J. E Barry.
Mr. Shabyi complimented the members
of the drill corps upon their fine appear
lance and introduced Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Campbell began by saying that he
had about made up his mind to withdraw
from politics, for he had grown gray
haired and stoop-shouldered in supporting
the platforms of the Republican party for
the pa*t quarter of a century, but he could
not resist the invitation of the P.'icenix
Club, an organization at whose side he
marcned six years ago.
He added : 'The man who would stand
silent now who is able to say anything for
his country would be recreant to the trust
which had" been reposed in him as that of
, a true, loyal American citizen. I am a
Republican because I love my country."
Mr. Campbell went on to say that pro
tection was the prime issue. He told of a
big meeting of the unemployed in Hyde
i'ark, in London, many years aÂ«o at
which the Lord Mayor began his speech
with a reference to the glory of Eutrland
and the prowess of her navy and how the
Lord Mayor had been interrupted by the
cry of the unemployed, "What care we
for England's greatness or for her navy?
We want bread and work."
But after that time when the Wilson bill
became a law the factories of Germany,
Â¥ ranee and England were opened while
those in the United States were closed.
l'"br two years past t ere has not been a
labor strike of any consequence in Europe.
Mr. Campbell spoke of the statements
oi Democratic orators during the last cam
paign to the effect that the workingiuan
under "tariff reform" would be* abie to
buy nis tin pail lor one- third of what it
cost then.
"He can buy his tin pail for one-third
of what it cost then," added Mr. Campbell,
"but in God's name where can he get any
thing to put into it?"
The speaker told about the Democratic
banner epread across Market street with
the legend, "Democracy and Prosperity,"
the word "prosperity" being so weak and
lilirn that it could not be read without the
aid of glasses. He asked whether the
American people Tvere not about tired of
]'mocratic tampering with the finances
and the prosperity oi the country.
The new Democratic fad, "free coinage,"
was next taken up by the speaker. He
did not believe in any single-idead Presi
dent of the United States, because there
were so many other issues of more vital
importance. Bryan had nothing to say
about the tariff, nothing about opening
the factories and giving the people work.
The speaker said that if the Republican
convention in St. Louis had declared for
free silver the Democratic convention in
Chicago would have declared in favor of
the gold standard "just to catch votes,
and you know it."
The doctrine of free silver was not fair
to the American silver-producer because
he had to pay $3 per day to every one of
his minerÃ, while the Mexican silver-pro
ducer pays only 30 cents per day.
But the filverites say that the Mexican
silver kings will invest their money in
this country. This is not true, for they
will not invest a dollar in this country
unless the doctrine of protection prevails,
but they will go to Mexico and spend
their money for the products of European
pauper labor.
Free coinage of silver will not give the
laborers and mechanics of this country
any money. They must work for it, and
unless the factories are opened under a
Republican system of protection there
will be no work.
There is 1600,000,000 in gold in circula
tion in the United States, and it is ad
mitted by Bryan, ex-President Harrison
and others that free coinage will drive all
the gold out of the country. In order to
repiace all this lost gold it would be neces
sary to run the mints of the United States
continuously stven days in a week for
fifteen years. So that under free coinage
the people would not have nearly as much
money per capita as they have now. Dem
ocratic tariff reform "reformed' this coun
try into debt to the extent of 5195,000,000.
Mr. Campbell expressed the belief that
should Major MeKinley be elected Presi-
Ident the bars would be put up aerainst
not only the importation of the products
of pauper labor but against the pauper
labor itself.
The Democratic party had always been
a failure in handling the finances of the
Nation. He instanced the condition of the
country at the time Abraham Lincoln was
elected and at the time Harrison went out
of office and at the present time in proof

in the American River, near Colfax, Placer
County, by using dynamite cartridges. Upon
learning that a warrant had been issued for
his arrest he fled and went to the northern
part of the State. The officers of the Fish
Commissioners learned yesterday that Dough

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1896.
AIR MOTORS
FOR STREETCARS
They Are to Be Adopted
on the Market- Street
Lines.
Experiments in the East Being
Awaited Before Final Action
Is Taken.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM
Nearly All the Local Cable, Electric
and Horse Car Lines to Be
Converted.
Compressed air is to be used as the mo
tive power for the cars of the Market*
street Railway Company's system.
Developments in this style of motive
power have been closely watched by the
officers of the Market-street Railway Com
pany for some time past, and recent suc
cessful experiments in the East have
almost induced the company to adopt this
A Compressed Air Motor Car.
mode of propulsion as soon as all condi
tions are favorable to the change.
Charles F. Crocker, president of the
company, stated yesterday that while the
matter had not been formally settled,
it was one of the things contemplated in
connection with the improvement of the
company's system. He added that expeir
ments are now being made in the East,
and on the result of these would depend
the final action of the company. He fur
ther explained that everything looked
favorable for the success of these trials.
The plan contemplates the conversion of
not only the cable and horse lines, but the
electric roads into compressed air rail
ways. Where the grades are too steep,
however, the present methods of propul
sion will be retained. The roads that are
not likely to be changed for this reason
are the Castro, Powell, Sacramento and
Clay-street lines.
Compressed air at the present day is
applied to more than two hundred dis
tinct mechanical uses. During the past
few years, while the public has been ab
sorbed with' the wonderful achievements
in the electrical world, the best inventive
talents have been at work on this great
medium, unlimited in the supply, until it
has been thoroughly subjected to man's
intellect.
Compared with steam and electricity it
is said to be safer and much less expen
sive. Its alleged freedom from smoke,
vapor, ashes, cinders, odor, noise and
liability of explosion make it more desir
able than steam, and the simplicity, safety
and controlability make it preferable to
electricity.
As regards economy it is claimed to be
vastly superior to either, requiring much
less initial outlay, much less cost of main
tenance and is less liable to interruption
of service.
In Paris, in Berne and in Nantes com
pressel air motors have been in successful
operation for ten years, and the use of
compressed air on the continent is fast
increasing.
For over a year past there has been in
operation at Rome, N. V., an air street
motor, which has run through the heat of
summer and the extreme cold of winter
with equal reliability, and eight more
motors have just been completed for street
railroad service in Chicago and New York.
These air motor cars are of the same pat
tern and general appearance as the Broad
way (New York) caDlecars. They can be
chargea in one minute at a terminal
station with sufficient air to run the ex
treme distance of ordinary service. The
motors, being attached to the cars, are
independent, and interruptions to the en
tire line are, therefore, impossible, as is
the case with cable and electric power
systems.
The air-motor system requires no trol
ley-poles, overhead wires, cables, pipes,
conduits or other construction beneath or
over the tracks. The motors are placed
under the car floors. The use of air motors
avoids not only the unsightly poles and
wires necessary for electric systems, but
also the obstruction which they interpose
to the operation of lire apparatus and
house moving.
Such motors are said to be entirely un
der the control of the motorman, start the
car without any jerfcing and stop it quickly
and smoothly, and are claimed to be par
ticularly safe in crowded streets.
One of the strongest recommendations
to streetcar companies for the adoption
of this syatem is the comparatively inex
pensive manner in which the work of con
verting lines can be accomplished. The
motors can be applied gradually to car
after car without interruption to traffic,
and dividends can still be earned while
the change is being accomplished.
It is estimated that the cost of motive
power by this sysiem wiil not exceed
15 mills, or 1% cents per car mile â a much
lower tigure than under either cable or
electric power.
It is not expected to begin any of the
work of converting the local lines until
after the election, as funds are not now
available, and it is not possible at this
time to dispose of bonds to advantage,
owing to the unsettled condition of the
money centers, due to the silver agitation
in the United States.
Aligky WantÃ Damage*.
Charles W. Alisky, who two weeks ago
necured a divorce from his wife, Ethel Duff
Alisky, on the ground of infidelity, yesterday
brought suit against the co-respondent in the
case, George H. Newman, for $25,000 damages
for alienating the affections of his spouse.
COCHIN TIGERS.
Lieutenant Polo Telia of His Curious
Experiences in Hunting
Them.
Lieutenant James Polo of France, who
has been for a good while past traveling
throughout the French possessions of the
world, was among Wednesday's arrivals
here. Lieutenant Polo is a picturesque
looking gentleman, with a dark, flowing
beard and hazei eyes. He wears a white
hat, and his garb throughout tells that he
is a travelerâ one who has probably seen
much of adventure.
Conversation with the lieutenant showed
that this was true. He has been six
months in Tonquin, three months in
Cambodia, and for an almost equal length
of time in Cochin China.
"I have bad a very enjoyable trip,"
said the lieutenant yesterday. "Prob
ably the most amusement I had grew out
of my huntinp experiences. I hunted in
all countries that I was in, and there is a
great deal of game in all of them, too.
"But the most game that I saw and the
biggest, the most fascinating in every re
spect for a man that really wants hunting
ot a kind that will thrill the blood, 1 found
in Cochin China. There I went out after
tigers that roam in that country. There
are a great many of them there, and some
of them are very big; and they are not
amiable to meet, either. I went out with
a large party and we hunted in different
sections.
"We did not search for the tigers es
pecially in tbe jungle, for there they are
as often found in the open as anywhere
else. We were so successful in our hunts
that we got no less than seven tigers. Of
course in killing so many we had a good
many thrillinar experiences and there were
some close calls among members of our
party. Besides these tigers we killed a
creut many stags and smaller animals. It
is undeniable that Cochin China as a coun
try for sportsmen is one of the very best
that coald be desired."
Lieutenant Polo is on his way to bis
home in Paris. He will proCably be here
only a short time.
"WHAT CATHOLICS
DO NOT BELIEVE"
The Subject of Father P.
C. Yorke's Last Lec
ture.
He Is Sure That This City Is
Sick of Religious Con
troversy.
GOOD PEOPLE ARE EQUALS
Salvation Wiil Not Be Denied to
Members of Churches Other
Than Catholic
Father P. C. Yorke spoke last evening
at the annual lecture of Mission Council
No. 3, Y. M. 1., held at Mission Parlor
Hall, on Seventeenth street.
There were other pleasant features, In
cludine an introductory by John P.
Henry, president of the council; a piano
duet by the Misses Gadsby; an address by
Robert Wilson, chairman of the evening;
soprano solo by Miss Katherine Black,
and a tenor solo by W. J. O'Brien.
The Hall was over-crowded and hun
dreds of women, men and children stood
for hours in a sweltering atmosphere
cheering and smiling in the face of many
personal inconveniences.
Robert Wilson introduced Father Yorke.
He devoted some minutes in telling inter
esting stories, reminiscences a* it were,
of his home in England. He told of the
belief that it was but right when struck
on one cheek to turn the other for a simi
lar visitation.
He related, however, the incident of a
clergyman who had been knocked down
twice, once irom each side, and who, be
lieving he had compiled with the Biblical
idea, pulled off his coat and gave his as
sailant a righteous thrashing.
"This is exactly what Father Yorke has
done. He was nrst slapped on one side
and then on the other. He did all the law
required and was knocked down twice,"
said the speaker; "but he has followed
the example of the English clergyman,
has taken off his coat and has been ad
ministering the thrashing ever since."
"1 have often heard, but I have never
experienced it until now," said Father
Yorke in his introductory remarks, "what
it was to be in the Mission warm belt."
This allusion to the enthusiasm with
which the speaker bad been received
brought on a recurrence of the same.
"I believe in the broad American prin
ciple which gives us all, Jews, Catholics,
Protestants and disbelievers, the right to
disagree. I believe every man has a right
to his own idea in this country of tolera
tion.
"From the bottom of my heart, how
ever, I wish the disruption of three years
ago nad never happened in this country;
and I cry for peace, and still there is no
peace. We Catholics, month after month,
have turned first one cheek and then tiie
other without making a retort, and still
there is no bitterness on our side.
"There is nothing in our hearts against
the Protestants. We are sure they do not
sympathize with bigotry, proscription and
intolerance, and we are equally sure this
town is sick of relieious controversy, it
is like brother against brother, iiouse
divided against house, with nothing to
gain but heartsores. We should be con
sidering more important measures, going
by the board, while we are discussing
questions that should have been buried
three centuries ago.
"The object of these lectures, given un- ,
der the auspices of the Y. M. 1., is not to j
stir up religious controversy, but to teach
what the Catholic church believes and to
remove the view of those who look at the
Catboiic religion through colored glasses
fitted during their early education.
"I propose to speak only on 'What
Catholics Do Not Believe.' "
Father Yorke deitly handled the subject
of the Immaculate Conception, and met
the idea that the Virgin Mary was adored
by the Cut holies by saying she was only
revered and respected simply as is the
mother of Washington or our own mother.
"She is Mary, the first lady of the world."
Continuing on the proposition ot idol
atry the speaker said :
'-We do not believe in idols, as some
say. It is not so that we adore images
that have no eyes to see nor ears to hear.
Those images we have in the Catholic
church we know are mere dead things.
We know how they are made and fre
quently how much they cost. We put
â¢.ucm up in our churches as we do in our
homes the pictures of those we love;
in our parks statues of statesmen, war
riors and others we honor. Why not, then,
put up statues in our churches ot" saints,
who certainly are fully as deserving of
honor as your James Licks and the like.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the only use
we have for statues in our churches.
"It is said we believe the Bible is a bad
book and should be under lock and key,
and we believe it should be kept from the
people. It is not so. We believe it is the
word of God, written under the dictation
of the Holy Spirit, but we believe it should
be explained because it is not everybody
who can understand it.
"For instance, Baptists believe in a cer
tain method of baptism, Methodists have
another idea, and so do Presbyterians and
others. It is only that they have accepted
their respective views of the Bible and
were never properly directed to its true
understanding. It is just as if every citi
zen were furnished with a copy of the con
stitution of the United States to read and
then each allowed to go off his own way to
decide how the country should be gov
erned.
"We are reproached with believing in
the infallibility of the Pope. This propo
sition is not understood. We Catholics
regard the Pope as you mignt say the Su
preme Court of our religion. He is the.
arbiter of all oar controversy and beyond
his decisions there is no recourse.
"In this City there is a spire on every
corner, and they hate each other a little
less than they hate us. The best of it is
that nine out of ten do not know what
they differ about.
"If they got all their little churches into
one grand one like ours instead of fretting
themselves away, they would have power
they do not possess to-day. The trouble
with them is they have no supreme court.
In politics and business they have such a
tribunal, why not have such in religion?
"We do not believe that because you are
not a Catnolic you must necessarily be
damned. Thank God, that is one thing
Catholics do not believe. We believe the
Catholic religion is the true one, and we
believe there is no salvation outside of it.
"I want this last statement to be well
understood. There is no salvation for any
man believing in bis conscience that the
Catholic religion is trie right one and who
does not follow it. It is the same with
the man who believes in the Baptist,
Presbyterian, Methodist or other creed,
and who does not follow the conscience
that should direct him properly.
"If the man's understanding or his
conscience directs him one way and he
goes another there is no salvation from
him. God expects little from those to
whom he has given little, but he expects
a great deul from those to whom he has
given much."
June Duff's K-itate.
judge Coif ey yesterday rendered a decision
which knocks out the pretensions of the three
nephews of Jane Duff, who died January 7,
1895, leaving a $38,000 estate to a favorite
niece. His Honor decided that the petitions of
the nephews had been improperly joined.
DISPUTED PROBATE FEES.
Heirs of the Eisen Estate ': Say -They
Have Be An Overcharged. â *â¢
County Clerk Curry and the attorney of
the estate of Francis T. Eisen have locked
horns over the probate fee to be paid for
filing the inventory and appraisement of
the estate. Under the county government
act, which the Supreme Court recently
decided applied to San Francisco, Mr.
Curry demands $246 for filing the docu
ment, while the attorney is willing to pay
but $58.
According to the appraised estimate the
estate is worth $248,864 39. but it is said
that outstanding indebtedness- which
must be paid reduces the net value to
$60,055 07. It is on this amount that the
attorney wishes to pay lees, while the
County Clerk claims his percentage on the
gross.
Another point raised by the attorney is
that the county government act of March
24, 1893, under which Mr. Curry is acting,
does not apply to San Francisco, and that
it is unconstitutional anyhow.
The paper was first presented for filing
October 2, 1895, and was refused. On
meeting a second rebuff Wednesday an
order was obtained from Judge Coffey
directing that the paper either be filed on
payment of $58 or that the County Clerk
appear on October 13 and show cause why
he has not obeyed the mandate of the
court.

WILL ENLARGE
THE LICK HOUSE
The Hotel to Be Built Over
the Builders' Exchange
Lot.
Some 200 Rooms to Be Added to
the Capacity of the
Hostelry.
SOME OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
Mrs. Oelrichs Is Making a General In*
spection of the Property With
That View.
The special administrators of the Fair
estate are not waiting in idleness with,
their big trust pending the probate of this
or that will or the settlement of any part
of the labyrinth of litigation.
With the return to the City of James S.
Angus, one of the administrators, plans
that have been long in contemplation for
enlargement and complete overhauling
and renovation of the Lick House will be
immediately put in motion. The old
building of the Builders' Exchange is to
be torn out and the space, 75 feet
front on Post street, is to be filled out in
harmony with the Lick House building,
thus adding not less than 200 rooms to the
capacity of that hostelry. The hotel is
also to be completely overhauled, refur
nished in a great measure and to be
painted inside ami out. It is expected
ttiat not less than $60,000 will be
spent upon the rehabilitation of the old
building and $200,000 on the big addition
to the structure.
Mrs. Oelrichs is not by any means put
ting in all her time in giving depositions
and in sliding down the chutes. A large
part of it has been employed in looking

administrators and business agents, con
sulting as to the best moves to be made
for the improvement of the City prop
erty.
Besides the plans with regard to the
Lick House that have been determined
upon it has been practically decided to
remodel the old office building on Mont
gomery street, cutting out the wide en
trance that divides its face and carrying
the elevator down to the level of the side
walk. A coupie more stories may possi
bly be added to it also.
A new building is also to be put up on
the site of the old one recently destroyed
by fire, on Commercial street.
The Bella Vista Hotel, which has been
leased to Mrs. Tracey, will also be remod
eled somewhat.
As to the big enterprise on North Beach,
the work is going forward without any
interruption. The contract originally pro
vided for the expenditure of $300,000, of
which $150,000 has already been paid out.
Speakine of the work of reclaiming the
large stretch of land at the foot of Van
Ness avenue, Mr. Crothers, one of the spe
cial administrators, said yesterday:
"Senator Fair's death interrupted nego
tiations for the lease of a number of these
blocks, but we anticipate no trouble in
making profitable use of them just as soon
as the estate is ready to make the con
tracts. We believe that coal and lumber
yards will be congregated there in great
numbers. The hauling for all the Western
Addition can be done from that point by
way of Van Ness avenue at a saving of all
the heavy grades. Oh, yes, we are goin"
right along to complete the improvement.

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, *896.
Get into line for victory.
There is to longei a Republican
wrangle.
The way to find harmony is to keep step
with the party music.
The appeal has been taken to the State
Committee and settled.
Has Bucfcley become a Populist, or have
the Populists done tbe other thing?
The only way to defeat both Buckley
and Rainey is to elect Colonel Taylor.
Which would you rather do, wrangle like
Democrats or unite like loyal Republicans?
San Francisco must be carried for Mc-
Kinley and Hobart, and no Republican
should forget it.
Mr. Pbelan â Dear Sir: Wi!l you please
explain your association with Boss Rainey,
and give details?
All true Republicans will bow to tbe
authority of the State Committee and
support it loya'ly.
The Taylor ticket has won the first bat
tle, and with a united Republicanism it
will win in November.
There should De no appeal to the courts
in Republican disputes. It is a poor
party that Is not capable of self-govern
ment.
All Republicans in the Fourth District
will support Spear and O'Brien, and ail
Republicans in the whole City should sup
port Colonel Taylor.
Mr. Phelan may be satisfied with the
layout Rainey gave him, but he will be
far from satisfied with the way the people
will lay him out on election day.
Any one who wishes to continue dis-
Bensions in the Republican party can
count on the support of Buckley, Rainey
and Willie Hearst.
Germany has produced in one year over
1,213,000 tons of sugar, while the United
States has produced only 22,000. Is it not
worth while lor us to develop that in
dustry ?
In this campaign the bosses, for once,
are divided, and now good citizens have
only to unite on Colonel Taylor to make a
clean sweep and establish a clean City
government.
What are we to think of a man who ap
peals his quarrel with the party organiza
tion to the State Central Committee, and
then refuses to be bound by the decision
of tbe committee?
Nothing can be gained for tbe party by
attacking the Republican State Central
Committee. On the other hand, every
such attack weakens party loyalty and
tends to demoralization.
General Horace Porter describes the
Chicago convention as "a ereat gathering
oi lost opportunities and splendid impos
sibilities," and very justly adds, "instead
of erecting a platform it put up a scaffold."
The Examiner cartoonist figures it out
that the shadow of Rainey is on the Dem
ocratic ticket, but to the observant citizen
it is clearly evident that the whole body
of the Boss is sitting on it and hatching it
out.
The proposal to have the Non-Partisan
Convention nominate candidates for the
Legislature is curious. If the election of
a legislator who is to vote for a United
Slates Senator is not a partisan question,
what is it?
Republicans who are tempted to find
fault with the decision of the State Central
Committee should ask themselves what
they would have done under the circum
stances. Would you have supported the
party organization and harmony, or party
bolters and discord ?
Tho prospects of the municipal cam
paign are most excellent. With a united
Republican party headed by such a man
as Colonel Taylor and opposed by the
divided factions of Buckley and Kainey
there is sure to be a vote that will give not
only a victory for the local ticket, but
such a .Republican majority as will assure
California to McKinley and Hobart.
The men who have been supporting the
Republican committee of which Mr.
Manwaring is chairman frankly con
sented to the withdrawal of their candi
dates for Elector and Congressman in the
Fourth District, and are now cordially
supporting Mr. Spear for Elector and Mr.
O'Brien for Congress. The friends of
these men can surely be counted on to re
spond to this action by giving a loyai sap
port to the ticket which has been declared
regular by the State Committee,
UNITY AND VICTORY.
The decision of the State Central Com
mittee will be accepted by all loyal Re
publicans as a final settlement of tbe dis
sensions in the ranks of tbe party in this
City. These dissensions were unfortunate
and should never have arisen. There has
been at no time any good reason why the
Republicans of Ban Francisco should not
have been as steadfast in support of the
party oiganization here as the Republi
cans of other parts of the State have been
of the organization in their localities. It
is useless, however, to go back and dis
cuss these differences now. Tney existed,
they have been appealed to tno highest
authority of the paity in the State and
they have been Bettied. The rest is clear.
All Republicans must bow to that deci
sion. Those who differed before must
unite now and move forward in the work
of carrying San Francisco for Colonel
Taylor and for McKinley and Hobart.
The outlook for a united Republicanism in
San Francisco is certainly cheering enough
to rouse the spirit of even the least sanguine-
With the Democratic bosses and their
"push" and "pull 1 " divided and wrangling
among themselves, if the Republicans of
the City unite in support of Colonel Taylor
it will be possible to achieve the best vic
tory for good government known to our
records for many a year. We may be able
to establish a complete Republican admin
istration in all departments of the City,
elect legislators wno will carry out RepuD
lican measures for the State and send a
stanch Republican to the United States
Senate; and moreover, roll up such a Re
publican majority in San Francisco as wilL
make the State sure for the Republican
.National ticket, protection and prosperity.
Wiiy should men permit petty differ
ences of opinion on small matters to pre
vent them from uniting for the accom
plishment of great results? Why should
any Republican curry these differences of
opinion beyond the limits of the party and
seek some tribunal lo overthrow the high
set party authority ? How long will tbe
Republican party be a self-governing body
if the decisions of the State Committee are
to have no weight and authority with the
rank and file?
Surely it is time to slop fighting. Elec
tion day diaws near and work must be
done against the common foe. If this City
is not to be ruled by Boss Buckley or
Boss Rainey the people must elect Charles
L. Taylor to the office of Mayor. That is
the issue before the Republicans of San
Francisco. AH Republicans in the Fourth
District are loyally supporting Mr. Spear
and Mr. O'Brien. Why should not the
Republicans of the whole City follow the
decision of tbe State Central Committee
and give a loyal support to Colonel
Taylor and the whole municipal and legis
lative ticket?
Who in this whole land would appeal to
Congress, after once exercising the power to
jiz weights and measures, to cut . dov.'n the
length of a yardstick or the cubic contents of
a bushel and make that reduction apply to all
existing contracts? It there any man, how
ever fided with enthusiasm; is there any
Chicago cruaader who would ask that the
cubic contents of a bushel should be reduced
and that every contract existing jor the pur
chase of grain should he fulfilled by delivering
at the smaller standard?â Benjamin Har
rison.
THE SENATORSHIP.
The duty of electing a United States
Senator will devolve upon the next Legis
lature, and it is of vital importance that be
be a true and tried Republican. Economic
questions of great consequence to the
whole country will come before the Fifty
sixth Congress, and it will be greatly to
the interests of California, as well as to
the interests of the whole country, to have
a safe-working majority of Republicans
in both housee. It will not avail the in
dustries and the commerce of the country
very much if Major McKinley, when lie is
inaugurated, finds himself confronted by
a hostile Congress, and this fact should
stimulate the party everywhere to see to
it that the next Congress is in sympathy
with the policy of the administration.
It is admitted on all sides thit proper
tariff legislation is needed. The industries
of the country are in a crippled condition,
and workingmen are idle. Better condi
tions for both are demanded, and they
look to the Republican party to see that
justice is done them. It is true that the
Republican silver Senators have opposed
tariff legislation of late because they be
lieved that the money question should be
settled first, but now Senator Teller says
that if Major McKinley is elected he shall
take it as meaning that the people demand
the settlement of the tariff question first,
and that he will offer no objection to Con
gress taking such a course. It is safe to
say, in view of benator Teller's position,
that all the silver Senators will agree to
suspend silver legislation until the mills
and factories are again in full operation.
The Democracy everywhere is willing to
trade Bryan for Congressmen and Sen
ators. The plan appears to be to control
one if not both branches of Congress, so
as to prevent the repeal of the Wilson-
Gorman act. What Democrats want is
still further reductions in tariff duties, and
they know very well that if a thoroughly
protective tariff law is enacted the ad
vantages accruing from it would so
strengthen the Republican party that
the people would not for many years
make a change in the administration. It
is of the utmost importance, therefore,
that the Congressional and legislative
tickets be looked after. The party cannot
afford to have a Republican President's
hands tied by a Democratic Congress.
Their convention was an exhibition of polit
ical hysteria and parliamentary delirium tre
mens. They didn't construct a platform;
they ran up a scaffold. Josh Billings once
said that the thing that did the vwst harm in
the world was "not ignorance, but knowing so
much that ainH so. 1 ' For a dollar they want
us to take 412 1-2 grains of silver, the rest in
grains of allowance. They want the Govern
ment to stamp 50 cents as a dollar and then (
not charge for the lie.â General Horace
Porter.
THE STATE COMMITTEE.
We rezret to note that yesterday some
Republicans permitted their disappoint
ment over the decision of the party con
troversy in this City to lead them into
hasty and ill-advised criticisms of the
State Central Committee. Such criticisms
were uncalled for and unjust. The com
mittee did no more than a due regard for
the facts and the law of Republican regu
larity required it to do. A calmer con
sideration of the subject will, we believe,
lead all Republicans to give a cordial ap
proval to the committee's decision.
The State Committee is made up of im
partial men chosen from all parts of the
State. It includes such well-known and
honored Republicans as A. B. Lcmmon of
Santa Rosa, S. N. Androus of Los Angeles,
F. L. Coombs of Napa and L B. Dudley of
San Diego. The reputation of these men
and of their colleagues for honesty and
party loyalty is beyond question. Why
should any Republican assert tne con
trary ?
It must be borne in mind that the mem
bers of the State Committee did not seek
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1896.
the office, nor did they of their own mo
tion interfere to arbitrate the dissensions
of the party in San Francisco. They were
cnosen for the office by the authorized
representatives of the party and were
called to decide the San Francisco con
troversy by members of all elements of
the local party, and especially by the fac
tion of the men wbo are now finding fault
with their decision.
It is under the management and leader
ship of the State Committee that the
Republicans of California are to make the
fight for McKinley and protection. All
wbo desire the success of the National
ticket and the triumph of Republican
principles at the polls must give an active,
earnest and sincere support to the State
Committee. Disloyalty to party leaders
at this juncture is disloyalty to :he party
itself. We mnst have unity of action if we
expect to have victory.
There caD be no question that a great
majority of the Republicans of this City
will cordially acquiesce in the decision of
the committee. Certainly no fair man will
countenance attacks made upon men who,
to say the least of it, acted according to
their judgment for the right and the best
interest of the party. Criticism fails to be
effective when it assails men of such
standing on such flimsy grounds and from
motives which are so clearly the result of
personal disappointment. The committee
may rest assured that the great majority
o! Republicans not of San Francisco only
but of the whole State will commend their
action and cordially support them in that
and In all else they do to promote har
mony, unite the party and mane Califor
nia a Republican State.
Uphold the Committee; recognise its
authority; acquiesce in its decision, and
under one flair co forward to victory.
Who w there in this land that would ask
Congress to cut the yardstick, and declare that
the new yard should apply to all existing con
tracts? Is there even a Chicago crusader
who will demand that the bushel measure be
decreased! Yet this is not a whit different
from their principle ivhen they propose to coin
a dollar from silver at a ratio one-half as
great as when the contract involving the dol
lar was made* I believe that personal and
National honor makes that thing absolutely
impossible. â Ex-President Harrison.
AN " INDEPENDENT " ABSURDITY
The proposition to nominate an inde
pendent legislative ticket is what might
be called the ultimate of absurdity. It is
within the scope of non-partisan action to
place an independent ticket in the field
for purely local offices where there is not
much patronage, but even then the ticket
Would necessarily have to be made up of
men who entertain pronounced political
views, for a man who was milk and water
enongh to have no well-fixed political
opinions would be too weak to fill auy
office with safety to the public.
A legislator has to be a partisan, es
pecially when there is a United States
Senator to be elected. For whom would
an independent member vote? The fact
is he could not vote at all. Candidates for
the United States Senate are party lead
ers. They have to be leaders. Who ever
heard of a non-partisan leader of a politi
cal party? If the so-called independent
member happened to have been a Repuo
lican or a Democrat before he became an
"independent" he would vote exactly as
though he were elected as a partisan. The
office of United States Senator is a politi
cal one. It is a Senator's business to
help put the principles of his party into
practical operation. He is a partisan and
must work for the good of his party. How
then could he be elected by a non-partisan
vote? A non-partisan legislator would be
in a worse fix than the dove of Noah that
found no place for the sole of- its foot.
But this project to run "independents"
for the Legislature is a Democratic trick to
get control of the Legislature and send a
Democrat to the United Slates Senate,
and there are those so blind that they do
not see what it all means. It is an old
Democratic trick, too, and has been played
With success at times. Whenever that
party was not quite sure of victory under
its own flag it dresses up a few stalwarts
as "independents,' or it takes those of
some other faith who can be "convinced"
at the proper time so as to vote for a
Democrat. Let no Republican permit
this Democratic trick to bs played upon
him. The Republican party has legisla
tive timber plenty and to spare. Let the
legislative ticket be composed of men who
have convictions and are willing to ex
hibit them whenever occasion requires.
THE YEAR 1873.
The BryaniteÃ are crying for the "condi
tions of 1873" before the bill suspending
the coinage of silver dollars was passed.
Either they do not know what they are
talking about or they are trying to mis
lead the people. In 1873 our circulating
money medium consisted of $25,000,000 in
coin and nearly $750,000,000 in paper
money, which was less than $19 per
capita, the population then being less
than 42.000,000. To-day we have $1,226,
--000,000 in coin and over $1,120,000,000 in
various kinds of paper money, making
the per capita over $34, with a population
oi nearly if not quite 72,500,000.
The industries and the farm interests of
the country have grown more in impor
tance and in wealth since 1873 than in the
preceding half century. The percentage
of working people who have acquired
homes since 1873 has been greater than in
all the preceding years. Since 1873 more
"wild" land has been converted into
farms than in the forty years ended in
1873. The percentage of increase in sav
ings bank deposits has been greater since
1873 than from the Declaration of Inde
pendence down to that period. Not until
after 1873 did the United States begin to
take high rank as an exporting and Im
porting nation. Not until after 1873 did
thÂ« silver-mining industry become a great
business enterprise. Not until after 1873
were capital combinations formed to con
struct great systems of railways. In short,
it was not until 1873 that the United States
assumed the position of a nation spelled
with a big "N." The material and nu
merical strength of the United States has
widened and deepened as was never be
fore seen in any nation since the world
began. America turned a new leaf in
1873, and the Republican party caused it
to be turned.
THE BEET-SUGAR INDUSTRY.
The most notable industrial prowth of
the last decade in California has been that
of the beet-super industry. Beginning
with an experimental output of capital in
the production of sugar-beets and the
erection of a small factory for the ex
traction of sugar, it has grown to propor
tions which even few of our own people
realize and become one of the greatest in
dustries in the State.
The honor and credit of having devel
oped this great industry belong by com
mon consent to Claus Spreckels. It
was his faith in the responsive qualities of
California's soil and climate, which first
called the beet-sugar industry into being.
It was his liberality in aiding and encour
aging the farmers of the Pajaro and Sa
linas valleys whicn bas made beets the
most extensive and valuable product of
their fertile fields. It was his careful and
intelligent selection of the best machinery
and methods for the extraction of sugar
which has caused the Watsonville factory
to grow to its present proportions and
achieve its present success. It is to-day
the splendid faith and liberal aid which
Claus Spreckels devotes to the sugar in
dustry that gives it reasonable assurance
of becoming the largest enterprise for pro
duction and profit the Pacific Coast will
possess.
The people of California are not blind to
the greatness of this industry nor un
mindful of the men who have made it
successful, nor regardless of their own in
terest in its further growth. In various
portions of the State the owners of lands
and the promoters of industry are plan
ning and preparing to engage in the rais
ing of beets and the extraction of
their sugar. The Watsonville plant is
certain soon to become the nucleus of
other factories for the utilization of thour
Bands of acres newly devoted to beet cul
tUTe. When it is remembered that last
year the total output of American sugar
was only adequate to supply 10 per cent
of the demand of the United States and
that more than $125,000,000 went away to
Germany, Cuba, Hawaii and other foreign
lands for sugar alone, it will readily be
seen how mighty are the possibilities of
this great industry and how important it
is to Californians that it should be pro
tected and encouraged.
Tho Republican party is expressly
pledged to the ample and adequate pro
tection of the beet-sugar industry. Every
Californian, therefore, who believes in the
upbuilding of such enterprises in his own
State, and even in his own neighborhood,
should see to it that his vote in the com
ing election shall be cast for the Republi
can party, which guarantees protection to
the California beet-sugar industry.

COLONEL CODY'S SENTIMENTS.
Chicago iDter Ocean.
Some time ago the Bryan ites reported that
"Colonel Cody, an old-time Republican, will
take the stump for Bryan and free silver."
Now comes a different version from a Western
paper: 'Colonel W. F. Cody says he has always'
been a Democrat, lives in Nebraska and knows
aud likes William J. Bryan. All tho same he
feels it is his duty to vote for McKinley and
honest money, and he says, as a result of his
wide observation in the West, that his fellow-
Nebraskau is going to get whipped."
THE SILVER
TRUST
Most Rapacious Com
bination of Wealth in
This Country.
Why Mr. Hearst and His
Multi-Millionaire Associates
Are Such Earnest Sup
porters of Bryan.
The political combination of the silver
mine owners forms the richest, the most
powerful and the most rapacious trust in
the United States, says the New York
World.
Other combines are content to control
the market and fix their own prices. The
silver trust demands that Congress and
the President shall by law raise and main
tain the price of their product.
The yield of their mines is about 60,000,
--000 ounces per year. It can easily be in
creased. The present price is 66 cents an
ounce. The Ontario mine in Utah has
paid over $13,000,000 in dividends, the
Horn Silver $5,030,000, the Daly $2,887,500,
the Bullion Beck $2,105,000 and tne Cen
tennial-Eureka $1,800,000. These are
small compared with the Comstock and
other of the great mines in Colorado and
Montana.
The Government of the United States â
meaning its taxpayersâ supplied a forced
market lor the entire product of all these,
mines not needed for export or for the
arts, from 1878 to 1893â fifteen years.
Under the Bland act they bought and
coined 291,272,918 ounces, at a cost'of $308,
--279,260, an average of $1 05 per ounce.
Under the Sherman act they bouzht and
stored 168,674,682 ounces at a cost of $155,
--931,000, an average of 92 cents. It the
Government were obliged to sell this sil
ver at current prices instead of coining it
and holding up its money value by a gold
reserve, it would lose $"115,000,000 on the
first transaction and $44,000,000 on the
other.
Not content with what the Government
has already done for them, the members
of the silver trust now ask that they be
permitted to take 66 cents' worth of tneir
bullion direct to the mint and have it
stamped free of expense as $1, on their
individual account. This would make it
possible for the trust to control the money
supply as no gold syndicate has ever been
able to control it, and, if they succeeded
in sustaining the price, to make a profit of
nearly 100 per cent on their product.
In furtherance of this conspiracy they
have secured control of the Senate, they
have nominated a candidate for President
by three parties, they have subsidized or
bought newspapers, and are making false,
misleading and demagogic appeals to the
voters.
The Washington correspondent of the
Chicago Tribune in a dispatch to his paper
August 6 gave a list of the names of over
a score of leading silver mine-owners in
the West, together with their total wealth,
who either in person or through their
agents have been active in shaping the 16
to 1 plank in the Democratic, Populist and
silver conventions held in St. Louis and
Chicago. This is the list with additions
made to it:

In a pamphlet entitled "The Silver
Plot" D. Griffith, referring to some of the
names on the abo/c list, says:
The silver interests of the Hearst estate are
immense. The fauily owns a paper in San
Francisco, and within a year or two bought
another iv New York to help along the scheme
ot forcing the Government to buy the family's
silver mines' product. The latter paper young
Hearst conducts in person. It is the only
metropolitan daily advocating the 16 to 1
plank. Most of the mines in which the Hearst
estate Is interested are conducted as close
corporations. Only one of its silver properties
need be spoken of here to indicate the im
mense wealth of the estateâ that is the On
tario mine near Park City, Utah. It has paid
in dividends $13,175,000.
â¢ â¢ â¢
When, twenty years hence, the history of
the present campaign comes to be written it
will no doubt excite the marvel of the his
torian that this vast conspiracy, this combina
tion of huge capital and monopoly. shouLd
have been able to successfully mask its exist
ence for so long a period and fool the people
into considering a proposition aimed to
benefit only monopoly and plutocracy, as
represented by the silver barons, while certain
to spread ruin and despair among the people
as a whole. The historian of that time will
search in vain for anything like it, or for any
thing resembling this combination, which,
with one hand upon the mijiing industry of
the West, seeks to hold the Government in the
grasp of the other:
It is an amazing fact that the people should
not have seen the truth, yet that in itself is
not without a parallel. It has often been the
case that great and stupendous truths have
come to light with full force in a moment, to
be instantly recognized aud excite wonder
that they were not seen beiore.
Will this conspiracy succeed?
The same lofty, patriotic spirit which caused
men to leave the plow in the furrow., to fling
down tools in the workshop and to put aside
books in the office and march to the front to
meet another great peril of their country will
give an answer to that question in November.
McKINLEY AND HOBART.
An Independent newspaper Pronounces
" " '- for Protection and Prosperity.
Sonoma News.
State, county and National nominations
have now been made, and to the intelligent
voter is presented the onpor tvn ity to decide
for whom he will cast his ballot at the elec
tion this fall. The list of county nominees on
both tickets is, we believe, made up of good,
conscientious, God-fearing men. In the county
platforms are incorporated wise and whole
some resolutions, and we feel assured that
what either party has pledged itself to perform
it will carry out Party doctrines need
not guide a man in electing county officers.
' The National ticket must, of course, be
viewed in a different light. Great principles,
indeed, the very welfare of the Republic, are
at stake. To bring about a return of National
prosperity, to save the eouii try from dishonor
and the currency from degradation is the
privilege and duty of every voter this year.
We have studied the situation, and we are
convinced that the Republican party, stand
ing for honest money and a protective tariff,
offers a relief to the present National distress.
It is with all firmness in this conviction ana
with a realizing sense of the patriotic duty
demanded of a patriotic press that the News
at this heated stage of the campaign, still
maintaining its independence and conserva
tism, pledges itself to the support of William
McKinley and Garret A. Hobart.
AUDITORIUM TICKET REG
ULAR.
San Francisco Post.
The Republicim State Central Committee,
having had under consideration the question
as to which of the two alleged regular Repub
lican organizations of this City was genuine,
has decided in favor of the Auditorium con
vention, popularly known as the "Spreckels
convention." It has declared that the Audi
torium convention represents the county or
ganization of the Republican party for the
City and County of San Francisco. The ticket
headed by C. L. Taylor for Mayor becomes,
therefore, the regular Republican ticket of
this City, and the central committee formed
or to be formed by the Auditorium conven
tion will Le the legally authorized executive
body of the Republican party of the City and
County of San Francisco.
Individual voters may do as they please, but
Republicans should act with the party and
are bound by the decisions of the supreme
hea/l, just as citizens are bound by the de
cisions of the Supreme Court. There is, there
foro, the same party reason for supporting the
ticket headed by Colonel Taylor that there is
for supporting the electoral ticket, which will
cast the electoral vote of the State of Califor
nia for McKinley. From a party standpoint
these things have the same status. McKinley
is the regular nominee of the Republican
party for President and Taylor is the regular
nominee of the Republican pnrty for Mayor.
Opposition to the ticket on the part oi any
oue will be treason to the party. The politi
cians who have engiueered the ticket headed
by Mr. Sonntag may declare that the Taylor
ticket is a boss ticket; but the same was true
of the Sonntag ticket. The defeated party may
declare that they will not submit to the de
cision of the State Central Committee. There
is nothing obliging them to do so. As indi
viduals they are at liberty to vote for whom
they please aud to control their own action in
their own way; that is one of the privileees
guaranteed by the constitution and is the
essence ol a republican form of government.
But they cannot do so and at the samo time
claim to be Republicans and represent Repub
licanism or the Republican organization, Na
tional, State or County. They may, however,
do so as dissenters, protestants, bolters or in
any other guise they may ciioose. They may
remain Republicans in faith, but they will not
be Republican partisans In any sense.
As already stated, from a purely partisan
standpoint, therefore, the Auditorium ticket
headed by C. L. Taylor for Mayor is the regular
Republican ticket of the CiÂ«y aud County of
San Francisco. That question being settled,
dissensions concerning the matter should at
once cease.
In. a Presidential campaign the leading ques
tion is the election of the Republican candi
date for President. Next and equally impor
tant is the election of Republican members of
Congress; and of approximately equal impor
tance is the election of a Legislature which
will make choice of a United States Senator.
From the standpoint of independent citi
zenship, each member of the party,
howuver, may vote as he pleases upon
municipal questions. Let him exercise this
right. Let any Republican who is dissatisfied
with what it ls known as the Spreckels ticket
betake himself to auy local camp he may see
fit, but in doing so he will have no right to
claim that he is a Repub.ican, or that he rep
resents any Republican organization. This is
the sum of the whole matter. Unless dissen
sions cease the decision of the committee will
possess no partisan value. Every true parti
san will abide by and enforce by his voice, his
influence and bis vote the decision of the State
Central Committee.
HIS IDEA OF IT.
You're talkln' now 'bout pleasure
An' where on earth It's found;

This is the Bill that will smother

This is the dollar as good as the
gold, go kept by the votes that will
go for the Bill that will wallop the
Bill that yelled for the bill to kill
off the gold that lay in the country
the Americans built.
This is our uncle, so hardy and.
bold, who warrants his dollars as
good as gold, for most of the votes
will go for the Bill that will larrup
the Bill that legeed for the bill to
knock out the gold that lay in the
country the Americans built.
This is the day, so frosty and cold,
when our lean old uncle, so hsrdy
and bold, will make all his dollars
as good as the gold, because of the
| votes that will back up the Bill that
will step on the Bill that yelled for
the bill to banish the gold that lay
in the country the Americans built.
AN ATTRACTIVE WAIST.
A pretty model for silk or wool waists is
shown here The box-pleats are not cut in one
with the waist, which makes it possible to get
charming effects by using two or more fabrics.
A cheviot gown of green, brown and white in
indefinite cheeks had box-pleats of Dresden
green satin. The full V front was of white
embroidered batiste. The reverse of cheviot
had a band trimming of green spangles. Two
collars were made, one of white ribbon, the
other of the green satin.
A dark-blue wool dres* had a vest of white
lace over white satin. The revers were of
white Ba tin, almost covered with braiding of
blue and gold. A white belt was worn with
this costume.
For extra waists of silk this design is much
liked lor its ttimness. A Dresden silk of \
brown tone had full-vest effect of thesilk, with l
box pleats covered by band net heavily span- \
gled in green, brown and rose color. Revers
of the silk.
A violet Dresden pilk had full front of white
chiffon embroidered in violet shades. Revera
of lace 07er white satin. White stock collar.
The waist is fitted by darts, which are nld
den under the box pleat and gathered front.
The back is seamiest", over a lining in, which,
the back and side forms are combined. The
waist fastens in center front.
Letters From the People
DEMOCRACY AND WORK
INGMEN.
Poverty and lJrÂ»titutiat% Cautfd by tho
Party of fret lrattr.
Jacinto, September 28, 1896.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Will you please pub
lish in the columns of your valuable patriotic
Americau journal the following from the pen
of an American laborer, which I earnestly
.hope shall receive the attention of all those
who have been for the past four years strug
gling for existence under the banner of free
trade and oppression.
The day is not far distant when the Ameri
can people will be called upon to select, by the
aid of the bollot-box, a President who shall be
none other than a true friend of the American
people.
In making this selection great care should
be tftken by all those who are dependent npon
labor for the support of themselves and their
families. They should recall to their memory
the causes which have been so disastrous to
our American industries and which have been
the means of bringing poverty and ruin to the
homes of our wonting people throughout the
length and breadth of this glorious land of
freedom and liberty.
During the past iour years under a Demo
cratic free-trade form of government 1 have
witnessed more poverty and destitution in the
homes of the mechanic and laborer than was
ever known to exist in any of the downtrod
den countries of Europe. Homes have been
broken up, and people wbo were once comfort-* t
able and nappy under a republican form of -
government are to-day scattered, God only
knows where, perhaps never again to be united.
Hundreds oi horny-handed sons of labor can
every day be seen traveling along the couuty
roads with blankets on their backs, going
they know not where in search of employment,
which they fina almost impossible to procure,
for the reason that the pauper labor of Europe,
which is supported by a free-trade Govern
ment of so-CHlled Americans, is more prefer
able to all those who are to-day endeavoring
to the best of their ability to create, if possible,
such an ill feeling between capital and labor
that will eventually be the means of causing
a panic and revolution such as has never be
fore been seen by the American people.
This is how the Democratic party, under
their banner of free trade and free coinage,
intend to repay the laboring people should
they be so fooli&h as to be guided by the faise
doctrine of free coinage which the Hon. Mr.
Bryan and the many soreheads and office
seekers are endeavoring to misguide the work
ing people into believing. I most respectlully
call the attention of Mr. Bryan to the tollow
iug words spoken by Daniel Webster, "He who
tampprs with the currency robs labor of its
bread."
But American people must not forget that
four years ago next November they allowed
themselves to be led ay the ear into the Demo
cratic free-trade trap, through the promise of
an abundance of labor and prosperity which
the Democratic mouth - organs guaran
teed would surely follow the election
ot Grover Cleveland and his all - Eng
lish party, but who have since their
election to office as representatives of
the American people done all in their power
to promote the welfare of England and the
downfall of our American manuiacturing in
dustries and the mauy other avenues of labor,
which, under a republican form of govern
ment, gave employment to the thousand who
are to-day making appeals for bread, whiie
the pauper laborers oi Europe are permitted
to steal millions annually from the treasury
of our Government in payment for foreign
manufactured articles, which, under a protec
tive , wou:d be in circulation among the
Americana to whom it justly belongs.
The Hon. William McKiuley, who is recog
nized by the working, people of the country as
the father of protection nnd the true Ameri
can friend of labor, very truthfully remarked
before thousand*- oi workingmen who traveled
hundreds of miles to his home in Canton,
Ohio, for the purpose of showing their loyalty
to a true American statesman :
"You cannot create confidence among
the people if you have no confidence in the
public treasury. Our dollars now are all lull
and sound, and all we want is an opportunity â 
to earn them." "â¢"
How can this be secured T It can only be so
through the election ot the Hon. William
McKinley, the standard-bearer of the Republi
can party, whose every action has aud always
will be for the advancement of the American
people.
Should the American people permit them
selves to be caught once more in the same old
trap simply because it is baited with a little
free silver, they will be held responsible befora
God and man ior the terrible results which are
sure to follow the election of Mr. Bryan, whom
I term a stumbling - block in the way of
American prosperity and an oppressor of the
American working people who are depending
upon the welfare and prosperity of American
capital invested in the different enterprises of
labor throughout the United States for their
daily bread. " J. B. Hagqebty.
BRYAN'S CEASELESS FLOW.
.Nebraska State Journal.
The newspaper correspondents who accom
panied Sir. Bryan do not want to hurt the
young man's feelings, so they have kept back
a number of stories that would make mighty
interesting reading. They are all aware of
Bryan's fondness for speechmaklng, and have
had several good things to laugh over quietly
among themselves since they left Chicago.
One of them was telling last night about the
number of speeches made during the day.
"Isn't it exhausting work for him to speak at
every station ?" asKed a listener.
"Not for Mr. Bryan," was the answer. "I
tell you he is dead stuck on the game. He is
always willing to talk. You know we have
been traveling on slow trains that stop at
every cross-roads. He never failed to be ready
for a talk. One day when the train was
ambling along through the country, one of
the boys dropped his hat out of the car win
dow. A boy picked it up and began chasing
the train to resiore it to its owner. It wasn't
so absurd a thing to do considering the speed
of the train. A dozen of us begnn yelling to
encourage him. I suppose we made a tremen
dous racket, for in a minute Mr. Bryan came
rushing into the car. 'Where are theyT' he
asked, eagerly. He was ready to make a
speech." >

TRIED TO STEAL
VALUABLE PLATES
Bold but Stupid Attempt to
Loot the Bancroft
Building.
The Thief, an Old and Trusted
Employe, Was Caught in
the Act.
A TON OF PLUNDER MOVED
Why the Cu'prit Was Temporarily
Shielded From the Police Who
Had Been Called In-
A bold attempt was made early yester
day morning to steal a ton of valuable
history plates from the basement of the
Bancroft bnilding, at 723 Market street.
The guilty person was caught in the act.
The doors of the big building were closea
at 6 o'clock \Vedne?day evening, and at 9
o'clock Janitor McKenzie discovered the
Stevenson-street entrance to the elevator
was unlocked, although he was satisfied
that he had bolted it on the inside when
he closed the building.
As property had previously been stolen
from the basement the janitor hastened
to tell the head bookkeeper, R. J. A. Weir.
In the meantime Special Policeman Con
Kelly and Policeman M. J. Jimenez also
discovered that t&e elevator door was un
locked, and they reported the matter at
headquarters and tried to find the janitor.
When the latter returned he found that
the thief had piled over a ton of book
plates in boxes on the freignt elevator
and raised the lift almost to the level of
the sidewalk.
When Weir arrived after midnight he
saw at a glance that the plates were those
of Bancroft's histories of California, Ne
vada and Mexico. Each of the thirty-four
boxes piled on the elevator weighed nearly
eighty pounds, or a total of more than a
ton, and the clutches on the elevator shaft
were set to prevent the- mass from failing
into the basement. To the company the
plates are worth several thousand dollars,
but to any one else not over $60 for old
type metal.
Weir telephoned to the police head
quarters and Lieutenant Birdsall commu
nicated with Captain Spillann of the
Southern district, who at once dispatched
Serge.ant Donovan and half a doEun police
officers to surround the building and
search the premises. An examination of
the basement showed that the thief had
entered a large vault under the sidewalk
and taken the boxes in the rear of the
compartment, Â§o as to leave the front in
tact. He must have worked hard to re
move the ton of metal to the freight
elevator.
No intruder conld be found, and it was
surmised that he had pone for a wagon to
remove the plunder. Sergeant Donovan
secreted the policemÂ«n along the block,
but no vehicle appeared up to 6 o'clock
yesterday morning, the time for the night
police to report off duty.
Soon after their departure an exDress
waeon drove to the elevator door and the
driver proceeded to put on his load. He
had hardly lifted the first block when he
was pounced upon by Weir and Janitor
McKenzie, who were painfully surprised
to find the thief was an intimate friend
and a former employe of the company.
O. C. Richards was at once sent for, and
the thief made a fall confession of his
guiit. stating that he was sorely pressed
for money, and his intention was to sell
the valuable plates for about 3 cents a
pound.
The reason the fellow was not at once
turned over to the police and charged witn
burgiary was explained last evening by
Mr. Richards. He said that the guilty
person was an old .employe of the com
pany and intimately acquainted with all
the employes.
Two years ago he lost his wife and since
then his courage, to say nothing of con
siderable money at the racetracks. At
times recently lie was employed to do odd
jobs around the premises and had a full
run of the place.
No sooner had the man's mother and
sister learned of his disgrace than they
called upon Richards and pleaded to give
their relative another chance and not con
demn him to a felon's cell. Their appeal
seems to have prevailed, for Richards has
not up to the present made known the
culprit's name.
It is doubtful if the latter will ever be
prosecuted if he will tell who were his ac
complices in the crime, for it is believed
teat he did not operate alone. He would
have to dispose of the stuff to some one
who deals in stolen goods. If the fellow
does not tell he may yet be placed in the
hands of tbe police.
Several months ago six boxes of these
plates were stolen from the basement, ana
it is suspected that the same party was
the thief in that instance.
He must have hidden in the basement
when the doors were locked for the night,
as the elevator door could not have been
unfastened from the outside. The police
have found this door unlocked several
times within the past six or eight months.
Richards will have an interview with the
Chief to-day, and upon the fellow's con
duct depends his future.
MISS HOAGG'S SUCCESS.
A Native daughter Brings Down the
House in Italy.
Miss Henrietta Hoagg of this City is
spoken of very highly by Italian papers
for her singing at a recent concert at
Domodossola. For the last eight or nine
months this daughter of the Golden West
has been studying singing in Milan with
the master Ronzi, and it was at a concert
triven recently that Miss Hoagg distin
guished herself above all the other pupils
at Domodossola.
The hit of the evening, however, was
made by Miss Hoagg. Speaking of "this
charming daughter of the land of gold,
11 Corriere di Novaro says: "The public
had moments of absolute enthusiasm for
her. We are informed that she has
hardly been a year in Italy, but no one
would believe it, for her sympatnetic and
resonant voice is already so well under
control that it is no exaggeration to gay
that sue sings like a tried artist. The air
that 8hÂ« sang from 'Rigoletto,' 'Caro-
Nome,' was rendered with admirable fin
ish, and brought her a world of applause.
She was compelled to give an encore, and
responded with that delicious excerpt
from Rossini's 'Stabat Mater,' the 'In
flammatua.' "
BUDD WILL BE THERE.
The Governor and Staff to Be at the

The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw delivered
a lecture in the art gallery of the

tion of woman suffrage. The title of the
lecture was "The Signs of the Times."
Mrs. Nellie Holbfook-Blinn and Mrs. A.
A. Sargent, two of the most prominent
advocates of the local movement, were on
tbe platform with tbe speaker. Miss Shaw
was introduced by Joseph M. dimming,
secretary of the Mechanics' Institute.
To-night Governor Budd and staff will

TAILORS ON STRIKE.
The Union Calls Out ItÂ» Men From
a House That Had Re
signed.
A sHke has been ordered by the local
Tailors' Union with regard to Block &
Georges, the merchant tailors on Sutter
street, between Montgomery and Kearny,
and now not a solitary member of the
union will work for tbe fighting firm. But
a few weeks ago the establishment of Wil
liams & Co. withdrew from the union, and
its men quit working. A compromise was
soon effected, however, and harmony
reigned again between Williams and the
union men. Barely hi.d the union settled
with this house before trouble siarted in
another quarter.
About three months ago Mr. Block re
signed from the union, giving aÂ« his rea
son for doing so that he desired to De ab
solutely independent in conducting his
own business affairs. No action was taken
on the resignation until a few days ago,
when the union issued an order to all its
members in tbe employment of Block &
Georges to quit work. Every union man
in the house refused further work from
Block & Georges, and settled down quietly
to carry on a determined fight. The sum
of |10 a week is given each striking tailor
as long as he remains idle.
Mr. Block stated yesterday that he had
no difficulty in getting good workmen.
"I have no leeling whatsoevor against tbe
union," he said. "I concluded that if I
remained in the union I could not carry
on my business and stiil stand by my con
tract, represented by my pledge of mem
bership. So I withdrew from the union
to be independent. If the union men
wished to work for me I had no objection.
This is not a matter of wages. I pay good
wages to good men â what tbe work is
worth â but some men who have been
working for the firm for years left us."
HAS DISGRACED ITSELF,
What Older Members Think of
Phi Gamma Delta of
Stanford.
An Opsn Letter Severely Scoring the
Defecting Lambda Sigma
Chapter.
The recent action of the Phi Gamma
Delta Fraternity of Stanford University in
drawing away from its allegiance to the
main order, with an intention of affiliating
with some other fraternity, has caused
much comment, particularly among the
members of the order to which the defect
ing chapter belongs. So keenly is the
action of the Stanford fraternity felt by
the older members of the order that they
have submitted the following communica
tion and asked for its publication:
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
The Pni Gamma Deita College Fraternity de
sires the courtesy of your columns to forestall
misapprehension among its friends and the
general public touching the true circum
stances of recent events directed against its
honor and its interests in this community.
Within the last few days the Lambda Sigma
Chapter at Stanford University has announced
to its friends and to us and will announce
through the public prints (as they inform us),
that it will repudiate its sworn obligations to
its fraternity and form itself into a local so
ciety with the ill-concealed but indubitable
intention of becoming a chapter of the weil
known Eastern fraternity of Alpha Delta Phi.
It is only tneir declared intention to make
public this matter in the journals that has in
spired this communication. Their baste is
due to a desire toreacn the ear of the public
beiore the fraternity officials in New York can
late action.
That action will undoubtedly take the form
of dissolution of tbe offending chapter and
the expulsion of its members immediately
upon the commission of any overt net. such as
joining another fraternity. It is no violation
of fraternal secrets to say that all college fra
ternities require a solemn promise upon
honor that no member shall ever join another
college fraternity. It is unnecessary to add
that ihere may be no renunciation of member
ship short of expulsion. All members of other
fraternal organizations, all indeed who recoe
nize that an obligation once solemnly assumed
is sacred in the eyes of men of honor, will real
ize how it happens that among college frater
nities disloyalty to one's colors on the part of
any fraternity man is the utmost disgrace;
that the initiation by any fraternity of such
disloyal men is of equal discredit to itself.
It is questionable if Alpha Delta Phi would
participate in the present disgraceful proceed
ing were the facts known to it. The evident
motive of the Stanford Chapter (which it does
not deny) is that it hopes to belter its condi
tion under the colors of another fraternity.
To men of honor there can be no question of
expediency as against the sacred ness of their
oath. There can be no compact with dishonor.
In ordrr to unsparingly condemn this fool
ish and treacherous surrender by the Stanford
Chapter of the duty cue itself, its alumni and
its fraternity, the California Alumni Chapter
of Phi Gamma Delta and the Delta XI chapter
at the University of California have published
this statement.

HUNTERS' MEETING.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
Will Convene on Tuesday
livening.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
of this City will bold a mass-meeting on
Tuesday evening next at K. of R. B. Hall,
corner of Mason and O'Farrell streets, for
the purpo c of discussing questions that
are now of particular importance to hunt
ers and fishermen.
The decision rendered by the Supreme
Court has practically debarred the mem
bers of the association from a pastime
which they have enjoyed for years. As
matters stand at present sportsmen must
band together and lease marsh preserves,
or otherwise dispose of their shotguns.
The association has been for years
strongly opposed to the monopolization
of marsh pnd overflowed lands by wealthy
hunters. who bait ponds with tons of food,
which is sought after by wild birds, such
as ducks and geese, and thereby lure the
feathered game from outside districts into
th6ir preserves.
But the Supreme Court has ruled in
favor of the so-called preserve shooting
clubs and consequently the future of the
hunters who have been accustomed to
shoot at ducts promiscuously on marsh
lands is anything but bright.
It was learned yesterday that a syndi
cate of rich sportsmen, prompted evi
dently by the recent decision of the high
court, has under contemplation a scheme
for the leasing of all the marsh lands run
ning from Ignacio to Sears Point in Sono
ma County, which will be fenced and im
proved solely for the pleasure of the hunt
ers of the syndicate. Ponds will be
baited and clubhouses erecled. In fact no
expense will be spared, so it is said, to
make the marshes of Sonoma County a
veritable duck-hunters' paradise.
But the men of time and money do not
propose to stop at that. A branch of the
syndicate intends leasing several acres of
swamp lands near Alvarado and Alviso,
which will be looked after by keepers dur
ing the duck-shooting seasons. The only
spot near at hand that will remain open
for hunters who cannot afford to spend
$500 or $600 a year in the pleasures of the
cbase lies in the vicinity of San Brutio,
and it is not by any means unlikely that
those swamps or marshes will be leased in
the very near future by some of the rich
sportsmen.

FELL HEADLONG
TO HIS DEATH
James Blackburn's Ghastly
Fate in an Elevator
Shaft.
The Young Man Was Careless in
Handling the Freight
Lift.
UNTIMELY END OF A ROMANCE.
He Was to Leave for Omaha in Three
Weeks to Marry an Old-
Time Sweetheart.
James Blackburn, an employe of C.
E.Whitney & Co., cannerÃ, at 110 Davis
street, fell through the elevator shaft
shortly before noon yesterday, tumbling
headlong three stories.
The fattlity was purely accidental, ac
cording to the statement of William
Birch, a fellow employe who was standing
JAMES BLACKBURN, Who Met His Death in an Elevator Shaft
Yesterday,
near Blackburn when he reached in on one
side of the open elevator to unlatch the
door on the other side. Birch says that
tbe floor was slightly greasy and so
aÂ« to get a good footing for reaching pur
poses Blackburn went clear to the edge of
the shaft. He overbalanced himself, and
being unable to recover, he pitched for
ward and was dashed to the floor of tbe
elevator sixty feet below.
James Blackburn was only 24 years of
age. He came here from Omaha about
two months ago, and through his father,
an old-time employe of the firm, he se
cured employment with C. E. Whitney &
Co., one week after his arrival here.
The Blackburn family are all from Ne
braska, several sons and daughters still
living there. Mr. Blackburn and his wife,
daughter and the deceased, have made
their borne at 1109 Leavenworth street.
From the mother it was learned that
her boy contemplated leaving this State
for Nebraska on the 24th inst. On his ar
rival at Omaha on the 28th he was to have
married a young society lady, whose ac
quaintance he made as a mere boy and
who, with him, had grown up with the
understanding that they would some day
be man and wife.

A letter was received from the editor of
the Daily Pacific Builder petitioning the
board that plans for the proposed high
school building for the Mission be od
tained by open competition of architects,
because the public interests would there-
!by be best subserved. It further urged
that all architects in the City should be
given a fair opportunity to compete for
the work, and because, according to the
lav of 1871, such plans and specifications
should be advertised for.
On motion of Director Barrett the schools
will close October 12 for vacation to the
16th inclusive.
Director Murdock presented a resolution
that proper books be opened and an ac
count kept therein of the cost of each
school for salaries, supplies, repairs, etc.,
so that at the end of each school year a
statement may be made showing the total
cost of each school. The resolution was
adopted.
The protest of the Richmond District
property-owners against transferring pu
pils from the Sutro Primary to the Park
School was laid over until the neit meet
ing, which will be Held to-night.
RATES CUT AGAIN.
The Valley Boad Lowers the Charges
on Flour and Lumber.
Special rates on lumber and flour were
put into effect by the Valley road yester
day, as follows:
Between San Francisco and Fresno, flour,s4 60
per ton, carloads; between Stockton and Le
Cirand, lumber,s2 30 per ton, carloads; between
Stockton and Marguerite, lumber, $2 45 per
ton, carloÃds; between Stockton and Hugnson,
lumber, $135 per ton, carloads; between
Stockton and Sharon, lumber, $2 50 per ton,
carloads; between Stockton and Geneva, lum
ber, $2 10 per ton, carloads; between Stockton
and Fresno, lumber, $3 20 per ton, carloads;
between Stockton and Fresno, Hour, $4 per
ton, carloads.
These were put in to encourage the
movement of these commodities, as under
tbe class rates there was little traffic in
them. The new rates make a considerable
reduction from the class rates. Flour is
in class A, and formerly took a rate of
$6 70 per ton in carload lots between San
Francisco and Fresno, and $6 10 between
Stockton and Fresno. Lumber is in class
B and took a rate of $4 between Stockton
and Fresno.
Considerable reduction is also made by
these special rates from those of the South
ern Pacific' Company. The latter's rate
on lumber between Stockton and Fresno
was ?3 75, and the Valley road's new rate
makes a reduction of 55 cents per ton, or
about 15 per cent.
Tnese reductions were promptly met by
the Southern Pacific Company, so the
people of the San Joaquin Valley have
again cause to be thankful to the compet
ing road, which Coilis P. Huntington in a
moment of facetiousness had the hardi
hood to call "a toy railroad."
BROWN'S SUCCESSOR
Key, George C. Adams of St. Louis

tional Church.
The pastorless pulpit of the First Con
gregational Church of this City will soon
be permanently occupied. Rev. George
C. Adams of St. Louis, who has been act
ing as supply pastor, has been asked to

fied with these arrangements and expects
to be located here shortly.

from Judge Seawell, commanding Judge
Campoeil to desist from further action in
the case of Stephen Otis, a stockbroker,
who was arrested on August 22 on a charge
of embezzlement, preferred by Mrs. Annie
McManns.
According to the affidavit filed by Cof
fey, Judge Campbell examined Otis in his
department of tbe Police Court on tbe
felony charge on September 26, and held
him to answer to the Superior Court, fix
ing his bond at $2000. On September 29,
so the attorney says, an application to
vacate and set aside the order holding Otis
to answer was entered by the prisoner's
lawyer, and Judge Campbell announced
his intention of granting the application
on October 3.
It is contended that Judge Campbell
has no right to .revoke his own order,
the matter having passed beyond his con
trol and into the hands of the Superior
Court with the making of the order.
Judge Seawell ordered Judge Campbell
to appear before him on October 6 and ex
plain the matter.

THE SOLID SEVEN
SMILED SERENELY
Resolute Fight to Exclude
Testimony Offered by
the People.
Late Grand Jury and Expert
Horace Dunn Roundly Roast
ed by Counsel.
LEVITY OF THE ACCUSED.
The Court May Rue To-Day on the
Motion to Shut Out Certain
Testimony.
The seven Supervisors who were accused
of corrupt misconduct by the late Grand
Jury have quite an array of leeal talent
employed in their defense. Yesterday
Judge Seaweil listened to arguments sub
mitted by Joseph Campbell, Patrick Reddy
and John H. Dickinson in behalf of the
accused. Supervisors Hughes, Dunker,
Morgenstern, Wagner and King were in
court all afternoon, and seemed to be
highly delighted when Joe Campbell
lashed the Grand Jury *and roasted Hor
ace D. Dunn, the expert.
The engagement of Joe Campbell and
Pat Reddy cuts no small figure. It may
represent at least $2000 to each of the ac
cused Supervisors.
The first witness called yesterday on be
half of the people was H. C. Farquharson,
a clerk in the office of tbe Board of Super
visors. He produced the minutes of the
board sitting as a Board of Equalization.
Hugo Herzer, Chief Deputy Assessor,
was asked as to the value of the property
of the Market-street Railroad Company.
Here the counsel for the accused inter
posed an objection and fought vigorously
against the introduction of testimony
which might show that the Supervis
ors had undervalued corporate property.
The District Attorney may have it in mind
to show, when the Spring Valley count
is reached, that the Supervisors allowed
the company interest on an investment of
twenty million dollars when water rates
â¢were tiled in February. The following
month, when the property was listed for
taxation, the value, in tbe judgment of
the Supervisors, had greatly diminished.
Facts were published in The Call
showing that officers of the company went
before the board and presented a valua
tion of twenty millions when water rates
were under discussion. The proposition
was so plain that a mass-meeting at Metro
politan Temple readily comprehended it,
but there the "rules of evidence" were not
invoked to obscure the facts.
District Attorney Barnes is on the sick
list, and did not appear yesterday. His
assistant, Mr. Hosmer, had to encounter
single-handed the big lawyers from the
Crocker building. The jury was not pres
ent to listen to the argument, but still the
fact may yet be presented in legal form to
the jury of twelve that when it comes to
an adjustment of water rates the corpora
tion must have interest on $20,000,000,
which the people are compelled to pay,
but when it comes time for the corpora
tion to pay taxes on its plant and iran
chise tbe shrinkage in value is enormous.
As the Supervisors determine the valua
tion in both cases, the accused seven may
be put on the witness-stand to explain the
astounding fluctuation.
Mr. Reddy submitted authorities to
show that toe Board of Supervisors sit
ting as a board of equalization had judi
cial functions to perform. The only ques
tion to be considered, he said, was
whether the Supervisors rendered a cor
rupt decision. It cut no figure whether
the valuation was great or small. The
Supervisors were charged to perform a
certain duty â to hear applications and
render a judgment after listening to sworn
testimony. Rules of evidence would not
permit the introduction of testimony te
show that tbe valuation was pot correct.
The only point to be considered was
whether the Supervisors were corruptly
influenced.
J. C. Campbell spoke for more than
an hour during the afternoon. He
quoted from the constitution to
show that property should be as
sessed at its actual cash value, and
then turned to the record showing that the
Grand Jury's own figures contemplated
an assessment at one-haif the cash value.
Dunn, the expert, and the Grand Jury, he
remarked, robed themselves in garments
of righteousness and invoked the law to
blacken the Supervisors. In face of their
oath, they advised an assessment at one
haif the cash value. If the law could be
invoked to blacken the Supervisors, it
could with equal justice be invoked to send
the Grand Jury to the penitentiary. The
men who prepared this sneaking ac
cusation, he said, are more corrupt than
the Supervisors. The law says tbat the
Supervisors must act on the evidence pre
sented to them. Being placed in that
position, who can say that their judgment
was corruptly rendered.
King, Morgenstern, Hughes and Dun
ker smiled approvingly as Campbell con
tinued his roast.
General Dickinson did not take much of
the court's time. He said his clients were
not only willing bat were anxious to di
rectly meet the charge of corruption, but
be desired that it should be met in a
proper way. They do not want, be said,
to be held to a difference of opinion as to
value of a franchise.
The court indicated that the knowledge
of the witness regarding values might be
tested before the question was answered.
Assistant District Auornev Hosmer pre
ferred to reserve his argument until to
day. By consent an adjournment was
taken until this morning, ihe court signi
fying that a session would be held
Saturday. _____________
DELMER'S CLOSE SHAVE.
The Driver of a Coal Cart Tries to
i Split an Officer's Head Open With
a Shovel.
Officer George Delmer of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had
a narrow escape from serious injury yes
terday afternoop. He attempted to arrest
P. McGafliffan, driver of one of the Oregon
Improvement Company's coal carts, for
compelling a lame horse to work. Mc-
Gaffigan, however, resented Deimer's
familiarity ana a war of words ensued,
tbe driver's language being more profane
than elegant.
Policeman William Hennebery hap
pened to be passing and took a hand in
the fray. Seeing himself beset by two
officers McGattigan became frantic with
rage and made a savage lunge at Deimer's
head with a heavy coal shovel. Delmer
flung himself to one side, the missile graz
ing his scalp, and Hennebery hopped up
into the cart, where he grappled McGaffi
giin until Delmer could aid pirn to hand
cuff him. The trio then drove to the
North Harbor police station, where a
charge of assault with a deadly weopon
was entered against McGalfigan in addi
tion to one of cruelty.

The British Ship Jane Burrill as She Appeared When Hove To Off the Farallones Awaiting a
Pilot From the Bonita*
MORE NEWS FROM
THE LINLITHGOW
Captain Petrie Writes Full
Particulars of the
Disaster.
The Break in the Shaft Was a
Bad One and Very Hard
to Handle.
SHARKS WERE IN EVIDENCE.
Last of the Yarmouth Line of Clippers
Now in Port and Leading
Wheat.
The first vessel that has come here from
Melbourne, Australia, in ballast in years
is the British ship Jane Burrill. She was
built in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and will
probably be the last of her class that will
ever load wheat at this port. The Jane
Burrill is a wooden vessel, seven years old
and as staunch a ship as ever sailed the
seas. It took her 101. days to get here from
I the Antipodes, but Captain Robertsou ac
counts for the delay by the litht winds
and calms that were a feature of the trip.
Off the Farallones the ship was boarded
by the pilot. There being hardly any
breeze it was easy to throw all the sails on
tbe main and mizzen aback,' while those
on the fore were kept filled, thus putting
the vessel "in irons" until the pilot got
aboard.
Captain Robertson is weil known in San
Francisco and has a host of friends here;
He has been twice to this port in the Jane
Burrill, once in the Minnie Burrill and
once in the Celeste Burrill, all owned by
tbe same hrm, in which be is a share
holder. No time was lost in docking the
vessel and yesterday the ballast was being
taken out of one hatch while iumbor was
going in at another. As soon as stiffening
is in the ship will go to Port Costa to finish
loading and then San Francisco will prob
| ably see the last of the Yarmouth built
! fleet of wooden ships. Captain Robertson
will be missed by his many friends.
Fish may be scarce to-day. It was re
ported last night that the steamer Far
ragut with a full catch had broken down,
and another vessel was sent out to look
for her. If soe gets in on time all will be
well. If not sole and flounder will
bejust so much higher.
The schooner Prosper, over which some
anxiety was felt a month ago, is on her
way to San Francisco. She was spoken
by the steamer Progresist a few days ago
and should reach San Francisco about
next Monday.
The steamer Mariposa will take away a
very large cargo for Australasian ports.
Yesterday over 600 tons were put into her
holds and it is safe to say that she will op
loaded ten days ahead of sailing time.
Among the freight is a pyramid which all
the freight hands from New York to San
Francisco have helped in adorning with
various inscriptions. It looks like a tomb
stone. It is made up of a bundle of fine
whips and is consigned to a firm of sad
dlers in Napier, New Zealand.
There was no meeting of the Harbor
Commissioners yesterday. Commissioner
Chadbourne is in the East, President Col
non sailed for the north on the Noyo and
Commissioner Cole was left alone. There
was no business of importance to come
before the board, so the routine work will
be taken up next Tuesday.
News from the steamer Umatilla is not
encouraging. Her stern is now completely
under water and the divers meet with lit
tle success in their attempts to locate the
punctures. They say ths holes are near
the keel and will be hard to stop. All tbe
perishable freight on tbe steamer was sold
at auction at Port Townsend yesterday.
Goodall, Perkins & Co. are confident that
the vessel will be got off and in 6an Fran
cisco within a month.
The following is a copy of a letter from
Captain Petrie of tbe disabled steamer
Linlithgow, received by the San Bias yes
terday:
I regret to have to inform you that on the
11th mat. our tail shaft broke, smashing the
stem tube from end to end. The propeller
forced itself aft hard up against the rudder
post, and got a droop, and in *his position
now haags. On account of tae heavy swell
we can't get un ler the counter with a boat
to ilo any pood. The first thing we did was to
j remove the inner part by disconnecting the
] couplings, nnd we have put a blind flange of
: two thicknesses of an iron storeroom door.
Where we could not get it to fit close we filled
in with elmw .od. It is well bolted, and, al
though a long way short of being watertight,
it will reduce the heavy volume in case the
propeller does drop out. If the weather keeps
fine I will from time to tima try and get wire
ropes around it aud bind it to its place.
1 have told the engineer to sketch the
break.
At present the shell of the ship is not
pierced, and with the pumps we will be able
to keep the water down and -wait lor assist
ance coining. I have fitted out the port life
boat with an additional mast and sail, ana
provisioned her for about twenty-five days. I
am sending Mr. Veil away with a volunteer
crew of five others to try to make the main

840 miles, but I have hopes of him, being

picKed up before he reaches the mainland. I
have little hopes of any passing steamer com
ing near us, as we are not in frequented waters
for steamers.
It is just possible the Undaunted may. come
along on the same track. She was to leave San
Francisco soon after us. Callao is our nearest
place for repairs that I know of, and it is dis
tant about 2200 miles.
I have instructed Mr. Yell to cable you full
particulars as soon as he can, and then be
guided by your instructions. I will bottle our
position from day to day, so that they can
find us. We drifted the first day about twenty
miles northerly. The snip won't steer. She
lies with the wind on the starboard quarter
and won't come to. I don't think we can do
anything with the broken shaft by way of re
pairing it, for as soon as we get it hove up into
place there is bound to Le a heavy inrush of
water, ana the tube compartments wiil be
flooded and possibly the tunnel as well. lam
midy for either emegency.
On the Bth inst. we were on the tall edge of
a heavy rotary storm, aud although we were
going slow the shatt may have got strained
then. The crew have behnved well under the
circumstances, and we had no difficulty in
mustering a boat's crew, and I do trust they
will reach safety.
We are surrounded with monstrous sharks,
and that prevents us getting a rope passed
under by diving, but as soon as the sea gets
smooth we wt 1 try and hook it up.
Trusting you will be able to get the assist
ance of one of our gunboats and that we will
reach safety in due time, and should I get
picked up by any one else I will make for
Callao and communicate with you as soon as

Please give our relatives as much informa
tion as you can from time to time. The ship
is perifcetly safe although helpless. Position

Since August 12 the Linlithgow has not

LOCAL WHEAT BOOMING,
Prices Steadily Climbing and
the Brokers Are Deeply
Interested.
The General Tendency Is Upward and
There Are Ample Indications
of a Continued Rise.
The excitement in the call board of the
San Francisco Produce Exchange is be
coming intense in reference to the wheat
situation. The price of wheat has ad
vanced quite steadily since the middle of
September.
May wheat, which sold last week at 13,
yesterday closed at 25%. December wheat,
which last Friday was at 9%, was yester
day at 22J^. Spot wheat sold la small lots
yesterday at $1 20 and at 17>^ to 20 in
larger lots.
There has been a tremendous advance
I in spot wheat since the middle of Septem
| ber. The market is strong and both the
bulls and the bears are manifesting a
liveiy interest in the improvement.
May wheat opened yesterday at $1 21%.
The news from Chicago stimulated the
interest. As jisual there aro reasons
enough assigned on the street for the rise.
The hardening tendency in Europe was
noticeable the middle of last month, this
being based on the short English supply,
the English stocks having been permitted
to run down. Then bad crop reports
came in from Southern Russia, and also
from the United States, although the con
dition of tne American crops- is disputed.
A demand was created for American wheat
and this is necessarily felt. Some of the
movement is speculative, but it would be
difficult to point out to what extent this
is true.
The stock in the Port Costa warehouses
is 100,000 tons less than it was last year at
the corresponding time.
FRANK M' MAN US BUNKOED
He Obtains a Warrant for the Arrest of
Bryant Fanning.
Frank McManus swore to a complaint
in Judge Conlan's court yesterday for the
arrest of Bryant Fanning on the charge
of obtaining money by false pretenses.
Fanning some days ago made his ap
pearance in McManus 1 saloon on Third
street and introduced himself as the
owner of considerable property in San
Jose in search of a good investment in
the shape of a saloon. He expressed a
desire for McManus' ?aloon and soon ran
up a bill for drinks. He finally agreed to
put up $500 as a guarantee of good faith
that he would purchase the saloon and
borrowed $5 from McManus to enable him
to wire to San Jose for the money.
Fanning did not a train visit the saloon,
and McManus on learning that he had
piayt'd the same game upon other saloon
keepers determined to have him arrested.
Hence the warrant.
The Divorce Court.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a divorce
to Henry Beaver from Mary Beaver on the
ground of desertion. Custody of the minor
children was awarded to plaintiff.
Lucy E. Sorrel, whose husband was a South
ern Pacific conductor, but was discharged, has
sued for divorce. Corel recently went to
Guatemala, and when his wife went to see
him off she wus attacked while on the dock by
a strange female friend of her husbatui. She
charges him with neglect, habitual intem
perance aud failure to provide.
CORONER HAWKINS
WIELDS HIS AX
Dr. Barrett, the Autopsy
Physician, Loses His
0 ficial Head.
Says the Coroner Failed to Get
a Berth for a Friend and
Trouble Followed.
TALES OF POLITICAL DEALS.
How Ned Lanigan Walked Away
With a P urn Frcm the Board
of Education.
Dr. Barrett, for nearly two years au
topsy physician at tae Morgue, has lost
his official head. The Coroner's ax fell
Wednesday night.
In consequence of this sudden dismissal
of Dr. Barrett the air is full of all manner
of rumors, one side claiming that politics
is at the bottom of it, while the other
asserts with equal vehemence that politics
bad nothing in tbe world to do with it.
The only man who appears to be satisfied
with the outcome is Dr. Charles L. Morgan.
He has received the appointment of
autopsy physician, good at least until
January 1.
Dr. Barrett claims his downfall was
brought about by tbe failure of his
brother, who is a member of tbe Board of
Education, to deliver certain political
goods very much desired by Dr. Hawkins
for a member of his family. The late
autopsy physician pledged his brother's
influence in securing a much coveted posi
tion as teacher, but later found this im
possible. Dr. Barrett says that since that
time the Coroner has never felt kindly
toward him. He thinks, however, that
Dr. Hawkins should have given him an
opportunity to resign and not subjected
him to the embarrassment of a dismissal.
On the other band, Dr. Hawkins says
that Barrett was not dismissed because of
the failure of the latter's brother to secure
for a member of his (Hawkins 1 ) family a
position as schoolteacher, but for entirely
different reasons. He talks vaguely of
neglect of duty, and says that for the
present he will let it go at that.
"I regret very much," said Dr. Hawkins
last night, "that any unpleasant remarks
should have been made by Dr. Barrett or
any one else concerning the appointment
of a new autopsy physician. 1 want to
say, however, that Dr. Barrett is very
much mistaken if he thinks his removal
was brought about by the failure of his
brother to secure a schoolteachership for a
member of my family. All that occurred
over fourteen months ago and certainly
could not have had any influence at this
late day. It is true that Dr. Barrett's
brother promised to help me in this mat
ter, but I was thrown down at the last
moment. Ned Lanigan made a swap for
the appointment of policeman when the
force was increased, the teacher's position
going to a member of Lanigan's family.
"Dr. Barrett was removed because his
outside duties would not allow him to
give such attention to autopsies as I de
sired. I have known as many as thirteen
bodies to be on hand at one time awaiting
his convenience. This sort of thing could
not, of course, be permitted, and so I
made a change. That is all there is to it."
Dr. Charles L. Morgan, the new autopsy
physician, is a recent graduate, but stands
well in the medical profession.

Commercial World From Being
Duped.
The San Francisco Press Club will this
month give an entertainment, the first
public one it has held in two years. In
connection with this affair will be pub
lished a unique souvenir programme.
The club has learned that certain un
scrupulous men have already taken the
field and are taking advantage of the de
sire of business men to advertise, and are
obtaining money by false pretenses. It is
now desired by the Press Club toletevery
body Know that it has but three accredited
representatives in this "souvenir pro
gramme," who will attend entirely to the
meeting of merchants for advertising pur
poses. They are George Adams, Arthur
Wheeler and William Walsh. These gen

PCTJRS VITEIOL ON FUSION.
How Railroad Magnates Have Cap
tured the Peop c's Party Ma
chinery for Greed.
Thomas V. Cator is having a good deal
of trouble on his hands at present. Not
only is he up to his ears in doing politics
with his friend Christopher Buckley, but
he is catching it from every auarter all
over the State. The Populists from Slski
you to San Diego are in a ferment of anger
and indignation over tbe methods that
have been employed by Cator and his
State Central Committee. Day before
yesterday he endeavored to pacify Mon
teith, the Congressional nominee in the
First District, and the result of a very
stormy interview was that Cator learned
that not only was his Senatorial ambition
jeopardized, but that his qualifications for
the leadership of the party were being
seriously called in question.
Monteith does not hesitate to denounce
Cator in unmeasured terms. He declares
that the municipal convention has been
engineered by Cator iri the interest of
Buckley and 'the railroad and says the
only thing that remains to be done is for
the party to be reorganized by eliminat
ing the Cator crowd from its ranks.
Complications are arising in every
quarter, and among these is the corre
spondence which has been going on
between the Populist State Committee
and Messrs. Monteith and McGlashan.
In response to letters written by Chair
man Wardali of the People* Party State
Central Committee, asking and pleading
with G. W. Monteith and C. F. Mc-
Glashan to resiÂ»n as candidates for Con
gress from the First and Second districts
respectively. Mr. McGlashan has written
to the effect that this is the first lime that
Mr. Wardali has requested or pleaded
with him to resign.
Among other things of peppery quality
written by Mr. McGlashan in his letter
are the following:
To illustrate, in this Second District the
miners are engaged in a direct war with the
railroad company concerning mineral Janus,
and the convention deemed it wise to select
for Congressman a man who has lived in the
mining regions and been identified with min
ing interests for forty-two years. You have
substituted a candidate who was known and
raised in a valley town. The convention
named a ik.ih who has always, as
journalist, citizen and public speaker,
been identified with labor organiza
tions, workingmen's agitations, anti-Chinese
movements and strikes, and who was
elected to membership in the A. R. U. during
the great railroad strike. You pull him down
for a young lawyer iresh from college, whose
only appearance before the public was while
etnmping the district with ifarion Biggs, who
was invorable to the railroad while in Con
gress, and who now supports the funding bill.
There are 10,000 voters in the district wno are
members of the American Protective Associa
tion, and the Mayors of the two largest cities
In the district were elected upon this issue
alone. The convention selected an A. P. A.,
who has been somewhat prominent in the
order. You set him aside for one who repre
sents the opposition. You may be wiser than
the convention, and your candidate may be
stronger, freer, and in every way a better man
to represent the people, but the convention
had a right to choose, and your action is un
just, illegal and subversive of every principle
of Populism.
Every A. P.. A. council in the entire dis
trict which has taken action in advance
of the report of advisory boards has voted
solidly to fight for me. Say what you please
of the A. P. A.'s they are the truest
friends I ever hnd at my back in time of
trouble. 1 think I have convinced most
of those who listen to me that the news
papers lie as usual when they say I am work
ing for Grove Jolinson. Let me say, paren
thetically, that I cannot see any sense in your
wanting my resignation. If you really desire
tne defeat of the funding bill four out
of every five votes that have been promised
me are votes that will go to ilr. Johnson if I
draw out. Just as the Catholic vote would
leave me and go to Mr. Johnson if I had the
Democratic indorsement, so will the American
vote go to Mr. Johnson when you have had
your way. Fusion in committees does not
necessarily mean fusion at the polls. You
can't deliver the goods you are bargaining.
Mr. de Vries can win with me in the fight
much more easily than he can with my resig
nation in your hands. I could have held
10,000 votes away from Johnson that will
never go to De Vries.
1 am glad you say you are not "infallible."
Part ot your combination claims infallibility,
and you have downed every A. P. A. whom the
People's party nominated for Congress and
put "intallibles" or their sympathizers in as
fusion candidates. How did it ever occur to
you that 1 could be coaxed? Was it because
you could not drive me? This letter of yours
is the most supplicating epistle I ever read. I
consider it the iriumph of my life to have won
such a letter from a body of men who have
tried so hard to scare, buliy and drive me out
of the fight. It seems marvelous to me that
atter fighting me for weens, supported as you
were by the heavy artillery of the railroad, ihe
Catholic ciiurch, the Democratic party and all
the newspapers, you should now fall on your
knee and be*;, plead, supplicate that I give
you what we were fighting overâ my resigna
tion. Why, or course I will. Half this amount
of pleading would have got it at any stage of
the proceedings. I nave been earnestly cam
paigning four months and a hall, but, if I
knew that my election to Congress was sure,
I would hand my resignation to you in re
sponse to such a prayerful appeal. I am
yours at last, C. F. McGlashan.
Mr. Monteith also pays his disrespects
to Chairman Wardali. He begins by tax
ine him with treachery and insincerity
and with an attempt to dictate to the candi
dates. The following is an extract:
The railroad was anxious about the fate of
the funding bill next winter. The Congres
sional election this year could have but one
effect on that and that was a moral one. But
it is all important to the railroad. The elec
tion of pronounced anti-railroad men would
refute Huntington's assertion that the opposi
tion was but a few "cranks and sandlottters,"
while the contrary would assist him. There
were three distinctively anti-railroad candi
dates in the fieldâ Judge Maguire, Taylor
Rogers and myself. There were also two Con
gressmen up lor re-election who had sincerely
opposed refunding â H.irham and Hilborn.
Then, on the other hand. Grove Johnson was
openly and McLachlanand Loud passive] y pro
railroad. 'The railroad, for tne moral effect on
the refunding situation, must secure the de
feat of botn Barn&m and Monteith in the
First, the election of Johnson in the Second,
the defeat of Hilborn in the Third, either tbe
defeat or a muchly reduced majority for Ma
guire in the Fourth, the defeat oi Rogers and
the return of Loud in the Fifth, the return of
McLachlan in the Sixth and the re-election of
Bowers in the Seventh, when they would
claim his attack on Sutro on the floor of the
House was sustained.
This could be done by forcing me out In the
First and uniting the Democrats and Populists
on uu unknown or untried man in that dis
trict to defeat Barham. in the Second the anti
railroad lorces should be kept divided by
keeping both De Vries and McGlashan in the
field. In the Tnird by uniting the opposition
to Hilborn. lit the Fourth by stuffing the
register, fraudulent voting and a still hunt to
beat Maguire or give him a close race. In the
Fifth by dividing the Populist and Demo
cratic vote 3 between two weak candidates. By
nominutiug acaudidate against McLachlunas
far from Los Angeles as possible to utilize
local pride and interest in Los Augeles for Mc-
Lacnlan, and in the Seventh Bowers was
thought safe enough anyhow. Now all this
could be accomplished if the Populist organi
zation could be controlled. Mr. Cator had
their confidence; he was, as much as we dis
like to usejthe word, "boss." He wanted to go
to the Senate and on his ambition the railroad
staked its wager and won in all but in my dis-
Cator's influence was dominant in our State
Executive Committee. He largely, in con
junction with George W. Baker, shaped the
fusion programme. You simply carried out
the programme. Everything came out most
satisfactory to the railroad, all things consid
ered (for when they cannot secure the entire
loaf they take all they can lay hands on), ex
cepting, however, in the First District My
remaining there was a perpetual nightmare.
Mr. Huntington had given his hired men
orders to take no chances on me. I had naa
him arrested and was denouncing him vigor
ously and fearlessly. He was afraid of the
Australian ballotâ he knew It to be a terrible
weapon of offense in the hands of an outraged
and indignant public. The railroad had
shown its hand so unmistakably in the attack
upon me.
WANTS FEDERAL AID
An Inmate of Aguewi Asks Judge Mc-
Kenna for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus.
An application for a writ of habeas cor
pus, argued before Judge McKenna
yesterday in behalf of Stuart B. Strong,
now an inmate of the Agnews Asylum,
nn veils a peculiar condition of affairs, in
which there appears to be a mixture of
truth and fiction.
On January 6, 1892, Strong was arrested
at his home in Los Angeles and the next
morning was committed to the Agnews
Insane Asylum. His brothers, C. H. V.
and G. H. Strong, were the principal wit
nesses against him.
Strong now declares that bis incarcera
tion was fraudulently effected, and that
his brother, C. H. V. Strong, was guilty of
perjury.
Attorney Gailardo produced in open
court an affidavit setting forth these facts,
all of which had been signed before a Su
perior Court Judge of Sau Jose-
Strong's attorney contends that his
client is perfectly sane, and is being held
a prisoner contrary to the constitution of
the United States.
Judge McKenna took the case under ad
visement. This is the first time the Fed
eral courts have been asked to interfere
with a State matter of this character.
VINING IS AT HIS POST,
His Return Exposes Another of
the "Examiner's"
Fakes.
Was a Close Observer of Political
Sentiment in Varicns Sec*
tions.
General Manager E. P. Vining of the
Market-street Railway Company returned
from the East yesterday after an absence
of about three weeks. The trip was un
dertaken for tbe purpose of meeting at
New York his daughters Annabel and
Ella, who bad been making the grand tour
of Europe with a party of friends. Mrs.
Vining, who had been visiting her former
home in Massachusetts, also returned
vith her husband. The return journey
was made via St. Paul, Seattle and Port
land.
At the time Mr. Vining left for the East
a sensational story without any apparent
foundation was printed in the Examiner
strongly intimating that bis employers
were dissatisfied with his work and that
he had virtually been forced to resign.
Among other things the "fake" story
said:
General Manager E. P. Vining of the Market
street Railway Company has gone East on an
extended trip. He is not persona grata with
all of the officials in the Market and Mont
gomery street building. On the theory, per
haps, that the wish is father to the thought,
some of the officials are Intimating that he
may never come back 10 resume his old po
sition.
The fact that he has made preparations for
remaining away several months has given a
trace of color to the rumor that his absence
may be for an indefinite period.
Previous to his leaving it was known
that Mr. Vining was going to meet his
family to accompany them home, and the
length of his stay was announced to be
three weeks, and no preparations, except
in the imagination of the writer of the
Examiner's story, were made by him "for
remaining away several months."
Although Manager Vining only got into
town at noon he was at his desk imme
diately aftei lunch. While away he was a
close observer of the political sentiment
in the various sections he visited.
â¢'ln New York," he said, "everything
seems to be one way. Business is at *
standstill, and every one is waiting for
the election before engaging in any enter
prise or improvements of importance. So
far as I could see business men and all.
classes of people are very strongly in favor
of McKinley. The coming election is
going to draw out a reserve vote not or
dinarily recorded. Men that 1 talked
with estimated that the Republican ma
jority in New York would be fully 400,000.
I think myself, from what I saw and
heard, that it will be larger. The same
kind of feeling prevails in Massachusetts,
and particularly in Boston. A Â«reat many
of the so-called mugwumps, those who for
some years past have voted the Demo
cratic ticket, will this year vote for Mc-
Kinley.
"I came back through St. Paul, Seattle
and Portland. A cousin of mine who is
largely interested in farming and lumber
in the northwestern section of Washing
ton told me that he did not know of a
single man in that district who had any
property or business interests who is
going to vote for Bryan. The only Bryan
men he knew were the choppers in the
lumber region. AH the farmers were for
McKinley.
"In Chicago there was more feeling the
other way. The Bryan people made a
good deal of noise, but how much there
is behind them no one seemed to know.
"At St. Paul I found that the Demo
crats were largely in favor of gold and
were likely to vote for Palmer and Buck
ner, the nominees of tbe Democratic Gold
convention. The Democrats there may
not vote tor McKinley, but they will not
vote for Bryan."
MORE NOE CLAIMS.
Judge Sanderson Refasna to Allow a
Transfer and Proceeds With
the Cane.
Hearing of another batch of Noe suits
was begun in Judge Sanderson's court
yesterday, despite the affidavit filed by
Vincent Noe, alleging that his Honor is
related to two ot the attorneys for the
defense and that he has indorsed a politi
cal platform containing a clause inimical
to the interests of tbe plaintiffs.
Judge Sanderson denied the motion for
a transfer and read an affidavit signed by
G. W. and F. K. Lane, in which they deny
that they are either of them related "in any
degree to Judge Sanderson or any other
Judge of the Superior Court of this City
It was also asserted that it is well known
that none of the persons nominated by the
convention mentioned in Noe's affidavit
have been called upon to indorse the plat
form referred to, that the statement to
the contrary in that connection is entirely
without foundation.
James Rolfe, John W. Ruggles and
Thomas Muilaney, three of the defendants
in the present suits, declined to fight
them, but submitted their cases on the
evidence in the suit of Noe versus Augus
tine et al.
Devine Hnd No Diamonds.
Captain Lees resents the insinuation in a
dispatch from Sacramento that diamonds were
found upon Gus Devine when arrested by De
tectives Gibson and Wren and Policeman
Dinan in this City about ten days ago. Devine
has been hela to answer in Sacramento for
being implicated in the robbery of Wachom's
jewelry-store there, Tha Captain says that
Devine was carefully searched and no dia
monds were found upon him. The arresting
officers have made affidavits to that effect.
UNCLE SAM STEPS IN
Novel Suit to Be Filed Next Saturday
Against August McKinnon and
His Bondsmen.
On Saturday next Attorney Bert Schles
sinÃer, acting in conjunction witii Attor
ney E. P. Mowrey, will tile an action in
the United States District Court, in which
the Government is used as a mere figure
head. The parties directly concerned are
August McKinnon, a contractor, and the
following-named laborers": C. Rasmussen,
J. R. and M. E. McDonald, George and
Arthur Brown, J. D. Cox: and George
Loughead. The bondsmen of McKiunon,
Henry Eschbach and R. W. Russell of
Stockton, will also be made defendants.
It appears that some months ago Me*
Kinnon secured a contract from the GovÂ»
ernment for certain work on Lairds
Slough, near Stockton. He was required
to give a bond for the faithful performance
of the work, and also as a guarantee that
his workmen would be paid. It develops
now that he lias tailed to pay the men,
and the parties named are out the sum of
$1054 66. Under the act of August 13,
1894, the Government steps in and per
mits a suit in its name against any de
linquent contractors or bondsmen, pro
vided the expenses are borne by tha
parties to be benefited.
This will be the first action instituted in
the United States under the law mentioned
and hence is of more than ordinary
interest. It is understood that if this
action terminates favorably to the claim
ants Attorney Mowrey will begin other
suits of a similar character against well
known Government contractors here and
in the northern haif of the State.

NEARLY FINISHED
Progress Made in Their
Nominations Last
Night.
A Long Wrangle Over Who
Should Represent the Sixth
Ward.
CHARGE OF RUSHING THINGS.
Some Left-Handed Compliments Paid
to the Supervisorial
Candidates.
Matters bad evidently been got into some
sort ol shape before the opening of last
night's session of the Citizens' Non-Par
tisan Convention.
Ellert, Capp, Ashton, Lynch, Sherwood,
Payne, Truman. Menzies, Altschul and
Sbarborohela a quiet little session of their
own, they being the committee on Super
visorial nominations, and it was thought
everything would proceed smoothly.
But a snag was struck when the nomination
for Supervisor from the Sixth Ward was
reeached, and Messrs. Lachmann and Monroe
still hung in the balance, though the nomina
tion was balloted for three times.
The lecture-hull of the Academy of Sciences
was crowded to suffocation, and much in
terest was evident, everybody hissing, groan
ing or cheering at will, whensoever the spirit
moved him.
Durine the reading of the minutes Secretary
Milliken was proceeding to read an account of
what took place at the executive session of the
previous evening.
'â¢Stop ! Stop!" cried E. J. Le Breton, "if you
read the minutes of the executive session it
won't be executive. I move the reading cease
here." And It was so ordered.
Erneat Denicke, chairman of the committee
on Board of Education, reported in favor of
the substitution of Thomas Carew in place of
Jeremiah Coffey and C. L. Birrington for W.
A. Powers in the list of names suggested for
nominees to the office of School Director.
Jeremiah Lynch moved that the rule requir
ing a two-thirds vote for the nominees be sus
pended. This produced a tangle in which
everybody seemed to take a hand. A rising
vote was called for and only seven stood up.
The work of nominating candidates for Su
pervisor was then taken up.
Lawrence Devany was nominated by accia- I
mation for Supervisor from the First Ward.
Charles D. Zeile was also nominated by ac
clamation lor Supervisor from the Second
Ward.
John L. Hanly was proposed for Supervisor
from the Third Ward, aud was abouflto be
put through the paces with the same celerity
*s were his predecessors, when George Cum
miDg arose in great excitement.
"I protest against things being rushed
through in this fashion," he exclaimed.
"So do I," assented Charles B. Perkins, and
for a good quarter of an hour there was much
. edo, delegates drowning each other's voices in
vain endeavors to be heard, while names were
shouted from various quarters of the hall
with demands that they hi proposed for nomi
nation,
\\ hen quiet was restored M. V. Samuels pro
posed the name of Horace D. Dunn and Mr.
Perkins suggested that of I". M. Uelaney.
Both names were placed on the blackboard
under that of Mr. Uanly and the balloting
commenced. The vote resulted as follow* :
Hanly 35, Dunn 6, Delaney 3. Mr. Hanly's
nomination was made unanimous.
Ex-Mayor L. K. Ellert proposed William H.
. Phelps as nominee for Supervisor from the
Fourth Ward, who was forthwith nominated
by acclamation.
"Dr. Washington Dodge and Dr. J. S. Stone
were proposed ior the Filth Ward. The ballot
ing resulted as follows: Dodge 34, Stone 9.
Dodge's nomination was made unanimous.
. Mr. Kllert proposed John Lachmann as nom
inee for Supervisor from the Sixth Ward. He
stated that a strong personal fight had been
made against Mr. Lachmann aud hoped he
â would get thenominatioa.
Lester H. Jacobs protested Against the rec
ommendation and proposed ihs name of At
torney Henry E. Monroe.
The ballot stood Monroe 25, Lachmann 20.
This produced a hubbub, owing to the lack of
the required two-thirds majority. A second
'ballot gave Monroe 28 votes and Lachmann 10.
A third ballot was accordingly cast, resulting
2$ to 17 in favor of Mr. Monroe. This left
matters in as bad a mess as before, and amid
much confusion the nomination of the candi
date for Supervisor from the Sixth Ward was
postponed.
Mr. Ellert next proposed Peter Van Pelt, for
the Seventh Ward. Andrea Sbarboro named
l>r. Tulho A. Rottanzi.
"We don't want any carpet-baggers," cried
a whiskered delegate in the rear row of stalls.
. 'He is ntf carpet-bagger," retorted Mr. Cum
rning, hotly. "He has an Italian name as well
as a spotless record; but he came here without
any carpet-bag, and without any clothes
either, for that matter."
The vote stood Van Pelt 33, Rottanzi 12, and
Mr. Van Feu's nomination was declared unan
imous.
Colins M. Smith was nominated for the j
Kighth Ward by acclamation. Tbe same pro- j
cedure was followed in the cases of Albert |
Heyer /or the Ninth Ward. L. H. Foote for the i
Tenth and I. J. Truman for the Eleventh.
Dr. Charles A. Clinton's name had been sug
gested for the Eleventh, but his friends were
silent as the tomb, Truman meeting no oppo
sition lrom any quarter.
A* nominee tor t-upervlsor from the Twelfth
Ward, Mr. Eliert proposed ex-Senator William
Biggy, and Mr. Wilson suggested J. S. Conwell
oi the Wheelmen's Municipal League.
The names were balloted for. thÂ« vote stand
ing, Biggy 33, Conwell 13. On motion of Mr.
Wilson the nomination of Mr. Biggy was de
clared unanimous.
Mr. Jacob* moved that the nomination of
the candidate for Supervisor irom the Sixth
Ward be taken up, but his motion "died
a-borninr,"so to speak, being nipped in the
bud by Chairman Fitch with a celerity which
ovinced long practice.
Mr. Deniske next moved that the nomina
tion for School Directors proceed. There was
much contusion in disposing of the long list
of namei from which the twelve nominees
were to be selected. Tbe list was aa follows:
Dr. ft. L. Curtis (R.), Thomas Carew (D.),
J. L. Halstf-ad (R.;, George A. Kohn (R.), George
Lent (D.), Elliott McAllister (D.), Andrew Me-
Elroy (R.), Will'am A. Plunkett (D.), Dr. J. H.
Soper (R.), Wallace Bradford (R.), Dr. W. D.
Clark (R), Dr. C. T. Deane (R.), C. E. Freder
icks :R), E. L. Head (R.), A. H. Kayton (R.),
W. T. Kibbler (R.), John J. McCarthy (R), F. L.
Turpin (R.), c. L. Barrington (D.), Thomas R.
Knox (R.), Emeu Barrett (R.), S. L. Waller
(D.), Dr. Thomas Shumate (D. ) and Dr. D. E.
Barger (D.), H. C. Henderson (R.), C. H. Mad
dox(D.)
The balloting and counting of the votes
was a long process. The result was in
favor of the following-named candidates:
Curtis, Carew, Halstead, Henderson,
Kohh, Lent, Maddox, McAllister, Mc-
Elroy, Plunkett, Barrington and Soper.
Dr. Soper and Thomas R. Knoi were
nominated for the unezpired term.
Midnight had already been reached, the
work of counting the ballots for the last
nominees having been long and tedious.
The nominations were, on motion, made
unanimous and the convention adjourned

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1869.
DEMOCRACY TAKES
TO THE STABLES
Max Popper Gets Drastic
and Closes the Junta
Headquarters.
The Raineyites and the Buckley
ites Had Their Respective
Joys Yesterday.
THE BUCKLEY AID SOCIETY.
Senator John Fay Lands Suddenly in
the Buckley Camp and Gets a
Nomination.
The divided Democracy divided the joy
of yesterday.
In the Rainey camp there was little to
do besides celebrating the glorious victory
after the adjournment of the Junta con
vention, while Phelan and the rest of the
impotent minority were being digested
after having been swallowed by the tiger.
The Buckieyites had joy of their own
and their feast was still going on. They
smiled and drank and danced over what
they had already captured from the Popu
list convention, they swarmed at last
The Notice on the Door at the
Headquarters of the Junta.
night's session of that banquet to enjoy
another course, and they added to their
joy the anticipation of the siring of in
dorsements to be made by the "Buckley
Aid Society."
Neither wing had any particular further
business of its own to attend to, but talk
was plentiful and cheap.
The Junta found itself without any
formal headquarters, because a Demo
cratic coup had been played by Max
Popper, who had, in his disgust at
Rainey's capture of everything he wanted
10 take, closed up the party's headquarters
in the Flood building.
Max has been the main guy of the Junta
for some time. He took a deep though
not a very intrusive interest in its battle
for clean politics from the very moment a
year ago when Gavin McNab got Sam
Rainey and his fire department push,
John Daggett and his mint push and some
others to stand in with f. movement to
fight the returned Buckley in the interest
of goid government. So loyal was
Max that he advanced the rent of Flood
building headquarters month after month.
It developed that every last chair and
desk and ink bottle in the party's head
quarters belonged to Max, too, somehow
or other. It is 3aid to be a lot of old
Iroquois Club fixings, which he had owner
ship or control of.
Anyway, evening before last Pop
per's irorge turned so completely at the
way Rainey was running everything, in
cluding "Jimmy" Phelan, that he swore
for thirty-five minutes and then gave some
orders to his Lieutenants Devereaux and
Bienfield.
The result was that three ot Popper's
wagons stopped unheralded before the
Flood building. Without warning and
without further permission every suggest
tion of furniture in the "regular" Demo
cratic headquarters was hustled downstairs
into Max Popper's wagons and carted off
to be stored in his barn.
The door of the "Regular" Democratic
headquarters was soon locked, and when
that was done -there appeared on the in
side of the glass panel the sarcastic sign,
"Democratic Headquarters Removed to
St. George Stables, Bush, near Kearny."
That is what Max Popper did to the
headquarters. He has not been going
around like a roaring lion about it. He
has just seen Sara Rainey sweep the field,
and he has crawled into a hole and nursed
his woe in silence.
The loss of the headquarters hasn't
troubled anybody much apparently. The
actual headquarters on Bush street answer
all practical purposes and those, like
Chairman W. P. Sullivan, who don't like
them haven't the heart to care whether
there are any headquarters or not.
When the noise in the room is stilled
and when amid it the clock stops ticking
one notices it. Thus was the absence of
Gavin McN'ab. amid all this political rout,
especially noticed yesterday. It is years,
they say, since Gavin McNab was not at
the front or in the middle of lojal Demo
cratic politics.
It is recalled that Gavin, the author and
long the boss of the Junta, has been dur
ing this convention a four -spot that
couldn't be played because it was marked.
McNab and his adjutant-general, Chair
man Sullivan, ruled and dictated and
talked and promised and got interviewed
for months, but when the time for busi
ness came they stepped aside, and Sam
Rainey and Ed Lanigan claimed their
own.
Dozens of the lesser lights who stood
long by the "decent" faction, to get left in
the end, yesterday either exclaimed sadly,
"It's too bad ' or cursed for fools the
"kindergartens" they had followed into
"the soup."
The fact that the minority by threaten
ing to get out and bolt and roar and by
urgent pleadings did induce Bam Rainey
to accept Phelan as a stroke of political
policy does not count macn now in temp
ering defeat. It is seen and realized that
all this "pure government" minority, in
cluding the Examiner, surrendered to
Sam Rainey wheu he at last exhibited his
control.
It is seen that Sam Rainey conceded no
more than any boss would concede to any
corresponding minority; that he conceded
nothing he wanted much himself, and
that all the anti-Raineyites got out of the
convention was Phelan. four Supervisors
and two or three unimportant offices that
no boss out for the stun and the patron
age would care to bother with.
On top of this they have seen Phelan
talk bravely about a good Board of Super
visors and then accept Sam itainey's slale
and come forth and indorse it from top to
bottom.
This is not surprising as it is well and
currently understood that before Phelan
was accepted by Rainey there was effected
an understanding that if Phelan and the
charter boih succeeded the Fire Depart
ment wouid not be taken from Rainey's
grasp.
Now that the Junta convention is over
it is realized more fully the extent to
which it comprised the gold and anti-
Bryan element of the local Democracy, as
the Buckieyites comprise the silver ele
ment.
Tnis has made Phelan's nomination ap
propriate, as he is a sterling goldbug and
refused to be a candidate for delegate to
the Chicago convention on that ground.
Every gold and every Cleveland Demo
crat who has taken an active part in local
politics has been enrolled on the Junta
side.
An illustration of this is given in a
story of the fir&t session of tne platform
committee, which is reliable. Chairman
Alexander T. Vogelsang asked if it were
advisable to indorse Bryan. The vote
against it was 18 to 7. After discussion it
was decided to make that plank as brief
as possible and to say as little as possible.
So the Junta platform says not a word
about Bryan, and in a shrewd style in
dorses "the historical principles of
Democracy contained in the Chicago
platform" â not the platform, but "the
historic principles," if there are any
there.
During the convention three or four
fool nominators spoke the name of Will
iam Jennings Bryan, but in no case was a
decent cheer of Bryan's name heard.
The. National issue has thus further sun
dered the local Democracy and this is the
main reason why the Populists have con
temptuously refused to have anything to
do with the' Junta crowd and have sought
alliance with the Buckleyites.
One of the queer developments of poli
tics occurred yesterday, when Senator
John Fay, a Junta hero from the start,
landed in the Buckley camp. Fay lost the
nomination for Senator in the Twenty
fifth District because he was beaten by his
old enemy, Daggett, in alliance with
Rainey. Fay started out to run as an in
dependent, but he has been taken in by
the Cator-White combination.
The Buckieyites nominated George Cal
lahan. Night before last, alter Cator,
Buckley and others had effected the
proper arrangements, the Buckley con
ventions of the Forty-fourth and Forty
fifth districts met, received Callahan's
resignation and named Fay in his stead.
The Buckley committee on vacancies will
ratify the thing, and Fay's nomination by
the Populists is said tD be fixed.
Toe secretaries and the sergeants-at
anns of the Rainey convention met in Dr.
Ragan's office last evening and after con
siderable scrapping divided up the five
hundred and some dollars left of the $10
tax on every name presented for a nom
ination. At the close of the convention it
was ordered that the debt of $155 of the
General Committee should be paid from
the harvest, but the boys wouldn't stand
any such foolishness last night, and noth
ing but hall rent was allowed.
Secretary Saulman got $10 a night for
six nights, several assistant secretaries
got %5 a night and nineteen sergeants-at
arrns took what was left, amounting to
about $2 50 a night.
The Buckieyites are highly satisfied just
now with attending their second conven
tion, under the management of the Popu
lists, but they will break loose on their
own account again as soon as that Su
preme Court decision is rendered.
Bryan Silver Club.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. I.â The Bryan
Silver Club held a meeting to-night in
Linderman's Hull, when the political
questions were discussed and the arrange
ments for Saturday's big meeting were
completed. Thomas V. Cator is to be the
orator on that occasion.
SPOKE FOR FREE SILVER
Advocates of the White Metal
Rally at a Mass-
Meeting.
A. C Ellis and M A- Hurley Were
the Principal Speakers of
the Evening.
A silver mass-meeting was held in
Metropolitan Temple last night. The
Hon. A. C. Ellis ana the Hon. M. A.
Hurly were the chief speakers.
C. D. Lane, who presided, seized the op
portunity of denying that he had ever
forced his employes to contribute to the
campaign fund. "The statement was not
true," he said. "I have between 600 and
700 men in my employ, and what I did
say to them was: 'Boys, I would like to
raise a little money to get up some cam
paign literature. I should like you to give
a day's work each to raise the fund. I
don't demand it, but I ask you to do it."
Mr. Lane added that he had promised
his employes that whatever they gave the
Utica mine would give more, but he de
nied having coerced them into giving.
Colonei A. P. Ellis of Salt Lake City
said he believed the silver question to be
the greatest issue that had confronted the
American people in the whole history of
its existence.
He thought the silver Republicans and
Populists would unite with the Democrats
in settling it. "You know that for twenty
years you have been suffering under hard
times and falling prices. This is traceable
to the supremacy of gold."
Mr. Ellis combated the belief that there
could be overproduction of commodities.
â¢'How can there be overproduction of
cereals when there are thousands of our
fellow-countrymen starving? How can
there be overproduction of fabrics, when
many people have not clothes to wear?"
Speaking of himself, he said he did not
represent any silver mining interests, but
added that if he did, he had a perfect
right to do so.
Mr. Hurley began his remarks with a
panegyric of the Populists, who, he said,
constituted me bnlk ol the voting popula
tation of tins (â¢ mi try. He gave a history
of the demonetization of silver in this
country, and pleaded for that metal being
given its original standing.
At the conclusion of the addresses in
favor of silver, Miss Anna Shaw was in
troduced and made an earnest and
eloquent plea for extending the ballot to
women.
Wllliam A. Deans Club.
The William A. Deane Club met fo r per
manent organization at Myrtle Hall, Alca
zar building, last evening. The attend
ance surpassed the most sanguine expec
tations of its promoters. The following
permanent officers were elected: Presi
dent, Alfred Fuhrman; recording secre
tary, W. J. Reid; financial secretary, P. J.
Geary; treasurer, Sam Rothberg; sergeant
at-arms, J. W. Church. Committees were
appointed for the various Assembly dis
trict.
Several speeches were made by gentle
men of different party affiliations, pre
dicting success for William A. Deane for
Auditor. Two hundred members signed
the roll. Meeting adjourned to meet at
same place next Thursday evening. The
club is formed solely iv Deaue'f interest.
POPULISTS FOLD
THEIR TENT
Nominations End and Buck
ley Lets the Conven
tion Close.
A Sc-Called Buckley Emissary
Only Escapes With His
Life.
STABLEMAN RAINEY'S DEFEAT
Row Over the Alleged Miscount of
Votes in Conlan's Favor in the
Thirty-Seventh.
Last nieht saw the omega of the Popu
list Municipal Convention. There came
at last a time when there was nothing
more for the delegates to quarrel about, so
they finished with their nominations and
adjourned to the call of the chair.
The meeting opened in conventional
form, there was friction only in an alleged
miscount of votes over the Police Judges,
and only once did an element of excite
ment enterâ when Buckley was said to
have tried to turn Spinetti down for Police
Judge â and adjournment was taken with
out a single cheer.
The first balloting was done for Tax
Collector. The fight was between Godfrey
Fischer, a Bucfcley Democrat, and James
N. Block, a true follower of Stableman
Rainey. "Jimmy" Phelan's political
dictator was badly "turned down."
Fischer received 89 votes to Block's 2, and
was duly declared the nominee.
Next came the vote for Auditor. Again
Buckley came into collision with Rainey,
and once more was Rainey defeated.
Fleet Strother (B. D.) received 95 votes to
\. O'Loglen's (R. D.) 2, and was declared
the candidate of the be whiskered for Audi
tor.
For Treasurer Henry Doscher (B. D.)
was opposed to W. S. Asmussen (R. D.).
Both men were called to the platform.
Asmussen admitted being a nominee of
the Junta, but Doscher proudly pro
claimed himself a candidate of the "recu
lar" Democracy, and was given 66 votes to
Asmussen's 29.
For City and County Surveyor T. F.
Newbury (Pop.) received 57 votes to Rob
ert Munch's (Pop.) 42 and J. C. Bunner'a
(D.) 2. He was declared the nominee.
It was here announced by Chairman
Daywalt that the legislative convention
would meet to-night at 1159 Mission street.
R. L. Ryfkogel created a slight breeze by
intimating that the delegation from the
Forty-eighth was "stuffed." On rollcall
this insinuation proved unfounded.
For School Directors tne following vote
was cast: Samuel Waller (Pop.) OS, T. R.
Carew (D.) 88, John J. McCarthy
(D.) 83, G. A. Trost (Pop.) 86, Frank
Bragg (Pop.) 100, Dr. H. R. Mor
ton (D.) 85, James O'Connor (D.)
83, Dr. J. G. Crawford (Pop.) 87,
J. H. Wiley (Pop.) 80, A.E.Blake (Pop.)
66, J. K. Phillips (Pop.) 71. W. J. Cuth
bertson (Pop.) "82, J. J. Dowline (D.)
31, P. T. Flynn (D.) 9, C. A. Bantell
(D.) 41, W. N. Gnswold (Pop.) 61,
Benjamin Armer (D.) 40, H. J. Mowry
(D.)O.
It was decided that the twelve receiving
the highest votes should be elected in or
der to expedite matters. Therefore the
first twelve named were declared the inon
inresior School Directors.
For City and County Attorney H. J.
Cresweli (D.) received 80 votes to 29 for T.
Carl Spelling (D.), and was therefore made
the nominee of the People's party.
For Police Judges the vote stood as fol
lows: B. G. Haskell (Pop.) 93, W. J. Gavi
gan (D.) 56. Stephen O'Keefe (D.) 49. Wal
ter Gallagher (D.) 85, J. A. Bpinetti (D.)
68, Charles Conlan (D.) 57, George W.
Fox (D.) 20. One vote was scattering.
The same rule was followed as in ballot
ing for SchoolJ Directors, and Haskell,
Gallagher, Conlan and SpinÂ«itti were de
clared the nominees. Before the vote was
announced Haskell rose and fiercely
stated that the way the votes were coming
in showed the Southern Pacific Company
had caused Conlan's defeat, and asked to
resign himself. The result showed bis
heartaches unfounded.
For Superintendent of Schools C. W.
Moore (Pop.) received nearly all the
votes of the convention as against Robert
Haight (D.) Before formal announce
ment was made Haight withdrew and
Moore's election was made unanimous,
which it virtually was.
The voto.for Justices of the Peace was:
J. C. Flood (D.) 79, Sands W. Forman
(D.) 72, W. E. White (D.) 43, Al Fritz (D.)
21, W. J. Hess (D.) 90. J. J. Kennedy (D.)
67, J. A. Carroll (D.) 16. John O Gara (D.)
29, D. B. Richards (D.) 7, Frank Schilling
(D.) 36, George H. Dill (Pop.) 48.
Following the established rule for count
ing ballots, J. C. Flood, Sands Forman, W.
J. Hess, J. J. Kennedy and George H. Dill
became the nominees.
Here occurred the only exciting event of
the evening. Attorney Haskell suddenly
jiuuped to his feet and rushed inside the
railing that surrounded the reporters'
platform, and yelled in apoplectic tones:
"I have been most grievously insulted,
gentlemen of this convention. An emis
sary of Buckley is here and jnst ap
proached me with the statement that
Buckley said Spinetti didn't go. It is an
insult I wil not brook. This convention
is not dominated by Buckley or any ether
man.
"There he sits." Haskell fairly howled,
pointing with his finger at a man identi
fied as an Attorney Armstrong, practicing
in the police courts of Oakland. All this
time the man was begging Haskell to de
sist.
â¢â¢Put him out I" yelled the crowd, "Put
him out!"
At this Armstrong turned and fled
through a rent in the tent just back of the
platform, closely fallowed by R. L.
Ryfkogel, brandishing his fists like a
windmill.
It was the opinion of many that the
whole affair was a job of the Junta, aimed
at destroying Buckley's evident popular
ity. Others even went so far as to insinu
ate that Spinetti had it done himself. As
tne witness was in flight, nothing could
be positively learned.
For County Clerk J. W. Reay was nomi
nated by acclamation, as his opponent, M.
C. Haley, had neglected to appear before
the investigating committee.
E. S. Barney was elected |norainee for
Sheriff by acclamation, Armand Decour
tieux having withdrawn.
For Recorder, Thomas J. Glynn had no
opponent. A3 T. Carl Spelling declined
to permit the use of his name no nomina
tion was made for District Attorney.
Joseph Fasseler, the Populist candidate
for Public Administrator, had no op
ponent.
It was settled that the chair appoint a
purity of elections committee of five mem
bers by 4p. M. to-day. The executive com
mittee of the County Committee was em
powered to fill all vacancies occurring be
fore election day.
For Coroner Dr. Adam resigned, and W.
N. Griswold was nominated in his place,
receiving 79 votes to 3 for Dr. Thomas J.
Bodkin.
An attempt was made to rectify a mis
take in the vote of the Thirty-seventh,
which would have tied Conlan and Gavi
gan for Police Judge, but failed. J. K.
Koss filed a protest with the secretary.
Anj,at tempt was made to invest the ex
ecutive committee with plenary powers
by Gillespie, out that also failed.
The convention then adjourned until
the call of the chair.
INDIANS ARE IMPROVING.
Commissioner Browning Reports on Their
Progress in Education and Handi
crafts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. I.âCom
missioner of Indian Affairs Browning has
submitted hia annual report. He says
that with no outbreaks during the year
the education and civilizing of the Indians
has progressed and the main effort now is
and for years must be to get the Indian
on his allotment so as to become self-sup
porting. The Indians are becoming adepts
in handicrafts and received iast year in
pay from the Government over $500,000
for work done.
The Commissioner reviews the steps
taken by Congress to extinguish the
claim of the Ogden Land Company to the
lands of the Senecas in New York State.
The question of the fishery rights of the
Yakima Indians in the extreme north
west is still troublesome, because of the
infringements of the whites upon Indian
rights, which have not been successfully
protected.
Education has progressed rapidly in the
Government and Industrial Training
schools. There were enrolled in all
schools 23,352 pupils. The Commissioner
praises the work of the field matrons. He
suggests that the Commissioner appointed
to treat with several tribes of Indians for
their lands be continued to clear up the
work of mating sale of their lands.
Nearly all applications for Indians for ex
hibition purposes have been refused. The
Commissioner lays stress upon the need
of legislation restraining the sale of liquor
on Indian reservations.
A NXIETY IN ENGL AND.
Stock Jobbers Wonaer Which Way the Po
litical Cat Will Jump.
LONDON, Ekg., Oct. I.â The Times
and Echo continues to comment upon the
American political campaign. It says:
We would think Bryan's chances were
diminishing in America but for the evi
dent strain on the imaginations of the
people on the other side. We are still of
the same opinion as we have been all
along, but the Democrats are not quite as
soundly beaten as the people whose ex
istence depends on their defeat make out.
The financial outlook is somewhat modi
fying itself. There is no real improve
ment, however, in trade or in Wall street,
but the conspirators who have been bleed
ing the RiarKet are a little afraid they have
overdone it, and prices have been tempt
ingly put up.
It is entirely professional booming, for
the stock-buying public is wisely standing
aloof both here and in America. But the
American stocks will bear watching.
Meanwhile there is an ominous ebb in
the expansion of trade. The August re
port of the Government Board of Trade
shows a decrease in the imports as com
pared with the same month of 1895 of
nearly $11,000,000, and in the exports of
nearly $1,000,000. It may be taicen for
gianted that the terrible decline in Ameri
can trnde and the uncertainty of Ameri
can politics is mainly responsible for these
conditions.

friends Claim That He Went to Europe
' on legitimate liusines*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. L â The
friends of P. J. Tynan are positive they
can prove he went to Europe on legitimate
business. J. Brandon Tynan, his son, to
day exhibited a number of affidavits made
by residents of Kingston, Ireland, which
go to prove the ' joint claim of his father
and grandmother to the $75,000 ! estate of
her son, . a Catholic clergyman, who died
in Chile a year ago. It was to obtain this
proof that Brandon Tynan and his sister
Katharine were sent to Ireland by their
father. They ran short of money, and ,
Tynan, â  his son says, ' borrowed money
here â¢ and went ;to France to meet them*.
He could not go to Ireland himself, there
being a price on his head.
Dr. Hamilton Kill Come Here.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. I.â A special
telegram from Washington last night says
that Secretary Carlisle yesterday arrived
at a decision in the case of Surgeon Ham
ilton of the marine hospital service, who
was ordered from Chicago to San Fran
cisco. The Secretary saw no reason why
he should interfere with the orders of
Supervising Surgeon-General Wyman,
and consequently he refused the request
for a revocation of the order to transfer.
The result is that Dr. Hamilton will have
to leave Chicago by October 10.

RICHMOND IS HAMPERED
A Blind Sewer Causes Complaint
Among the Residents of
the South Side.
The Old Bay District Racetrack to
Be Cut Up Into Building Lots
?nd So d at Auction.
The residents of the Richmond District
are complaining because of the sudden
clog that has been put on the wheel of
improvements.
The population of that district has be
come sufficiently large to warrant the
building of :t schoolbousc, and such a
building has lately been erected on Sixth
avenue, between B and C streets.
There are thirty-six pupils in attend
ance. But no sooner had the schoolhouse
been erected than did the inhabitants
becin to regret their choice of the city.
This regret is brought about by the op
position of the directois of the French
Hospital who own the eastern side of tbe
entire block between Point Lobos avenue
and A street, and the heirs of the estate
of Hamilton of tbe firm of Baker & Ham
ilton, who own a large portion of prop
erty on the west side of the same street
and directly opposite the French Hospi tal.
Both of those parties have opposed the
putting in of a sewer from A street to
Point Lobos avenue, which would con
nect with the sewer already in Sixth
avenue from Fulton to A street.
As it is now the sewer on Sixth avenue
is completely shut np at the intersection
of A and Sixth avenue, directly in front of
tbe hospital, and this is what the people
there complain of.
To such an extent have they been
worked ud over the affair that a petition
will be presented to the Board of Educa
tion to have the schoolhouse removed to a
distance from this pest-breedlng locality,
as it is claimed that a sewer having no
outlet will in a short time become a ne?t
of disease not only for the children, but
for tbe patients in the hospital.
The expense to the directors of the hos
pital for having the sewer run into the
Point Lobos main brirk sewer would
amount to $250, and to the Hamilton es
tate $160. The other property-owners are
willing that the improvement should pn
ahead, but inasmuch as the hospital and
the Hamilton heirs own one-half of the
frontage, the Supervisors cannot order the
work done, as it requires a majority of
property-owners.
There are some, however, who claim that
the Board of Health has jurisdiction in
the premises from a sanitary standpoint.
The Bay District Land Company is tho
name of a new association which has just
sprung into existence since the transform
ation of the Bay District racecourse as
sumed shape.
This company hns in view the putting
in of a large brick sewer from First to
Fifth avenues on B street, which runs
directly east and west across the race
course, after which the entire track will
be surveyed into building lots and offered
for sale at public auction.
But the B-street sewer must have an
outlet or there will be trouble in Rich
mond between tbe residents and the
French colony.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by clou weather and rains.
â¢'Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in th* interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

active to-day, the sales amounting to 179,776
shares, against 219,000 shares ' yesterday. , The
falling off in business wasdue to excitement In the
wheat market, the bull movement in the cereal
having attracted general attention. At the open
ing stocks ruled lower, owing to weak cables from
London and moderate ', sales. Faring to Induce

been directed to Northern Spring, Humboldi and

sales from this class of stock have been made. 1 he
chances for McKiniey's election seem to Improve,
and wi.h this Improvement comes more confidence
all around. ' Holders of Wool, however; are not in
clined to neglect opportunities for selling when the
chance offers, as ' veti though I McKlnley may be
elected there is considerable doubt as to whether
he will have a Senate anJ a 1 ougress to work with
him in any tariff legislation required; therefore,
holders ' of Wool ; are not Inclined ; to carry Wool
until alter the election If it can be avoided. More
over it will soon be tax-payiog time,' when money

Prescriptions by Plgeov Post.
There is a medical practitioner in Scot
land, says th& Medical Press and Circnlar,
whose area of practice is so wide that he
has' resorted :to the method of using car
rier pigeons for the purpose of assisting
him in his daily labors. When,' for exam
ple, he is called upo"n to visit patients far.
distant from his home he takes with him
a number of his stock: of carrier birds. On
reaching an urgent case , and prescribing,
he forwards the prescription by means of
a pigeon. As soon as the bird reaches his
bouse a domestic carefully extracts the
message from under, its wing and hands it
to the doctor's dispenser," who makes up
the prescription and dispatches the; medi
cine to the patient. - Another convenient
arrangement resorted â¢to rby , this ; i enter
prising practitioner is to leave one of ' his
pigeons at the house of a far-distant
patient whose case may demand his : early
attention. When in such an instance
the doctor's presence is urgently de
manded, a pigeon is dispatched with a
message, ana the doctor is soon on his way
to the patient's house.

From a Fashionable

COULD NOT USE THE WALK
With the Aid of a Wheelbarrow and
an Electric Light He Went to
New Quarters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,*
908 Broadway, Oct. 1. f
There was an evict on last night that
was a novelty. There was no pathos
about it. The people who were legally in
duced to change their residence did not
express any great sorrow or show that
they were even moderately inconven
ienced, and a big crowd stood by and en
joyed what was undeniably fun.
Nineteenth and Brush streets, where the
scene occurred, is now a fashionable quar
ter, but there are still evidences of twenty
years ago when a man built his house one
week and lived in it the next, and it was
from one of these little huts that the evic
tion took place.
â  For a long time a family named Emery,
consisting of father, mother and five chil
dren, have been living in the basement of
the cottage.. Upstairs live the Bloom
bergs, who rented the basement to the
Emerys. For a long time the tenants in
o the basement have paid no rent, and as a
Jast resort the Sheriff was called in and
the furniture placed on the sidewalk.
Of course an indignant crowd gathered,
but when Mrs. Bloomberg told her story
the indignation faded away. She said she
had paid a month's rent for her tenants at
some other place, but that the locality
did not suit Mr. Emery.
While the crowd gathered the
mother seated her children in chairs and
attended to their appetites as though she
had kept house on the sidewalk for half of
her life. Emery stood by and seemed to
enjoy the notoriety to which he was being
subjected.
A good-natured artist who lives in the
big house across the street from the co<
tage went to tne scene, but wnen be heard
the story and saw how coldly his kindly
meant inquiries were received by the
evicted family he went away with his
â  philanthropy still in his pockei.
Mrs. Bloomberg helped tne Sheriff to
move out her tenant s furniture, and
slammed the garden ate with great glee
when the last box of crockery had been
placed on the sidewalk.
Emery quietly smoked and looked upon
Â° the wreck. He made no effort to move
his furniture till a police officer told him
he would be arrested lor obstructing the
sidewalk if his traps were not moved
within a certain number of hours. This
stirred Emery, and toward evening he
borrowed a wheelbarrow and proceeded to
move his goods to a little shanty a few
block Away. There is a big electric ligtn
on the corner, and Emery finished his
task of moving just at midnight as the
light gave its final flicker.

Record.
ALAMEDA. Cal., Oct. I.â Dr. William
P. Gibbons demanded the right to have
'.his name placed upon the great register
Â° to-day, but was denied by County Clerk
Jordan. "I will have my vote because I
am entitled to it," declared the doctor,
* and he looked as if he intended to keep
his word.
fie then referred to the fourteenth
amendment of the constitution of the
United States, which he claims prohibits
States from passing laws that woulii
deprive a citizen of his vote.
Clerk Jordan referred him to the Dis
trict Attorney to see what might be done,
but tne latter gave him little satisfaction.
He, however, suggested that the doctor
might try mandamus proceedings and
thus get the question before tbe Supreme
Court in time for election.
Dr. Gibbous left declaring that as he
was sick at the time he should have regis
tered and was unable to attend to that
part he would not lose his vote without
going to the last court to sustain his right
as a citizen. WOjMk
A New Athletic Club.
ALAMEDA, Cal;, Oct. I.â The prelim
inary steps toward the organization of an
athletic club were taken last night at a
meeting called for that purpose. The
prime movers in this were A. G. Burns,
A- P. Smiley, H. F. Sheldon and Perham
JSahl. They will adopt the Sandowe
durnbb 11 system and expect to equip a
room with dumbbells, fencing foils,
weights and pulleys and boxing gloves.
The membership is to be limited and will
consist of local business men and those in
business in ban Francisco.
The meeting was attended by more than
forty of those interested and committees
were appointed to secure information as
to a location and cost and amount of ap
paratus needed. Ihe general impression
existed that in order to secure the neces
sary funds to start with the organization
should give a huge minstrel show to at
tract attention.
The next meeting will be held a week
hence, when committees on constitution
and by-laws will be appointed and further
arrangements as to the minstrel show will I
be made.

BERKELEY'S GREAT COACH
He Has Come at Last to the
College Football
Players.
An Enthusiastic Reception Tendered
the Easterner Upon H s
Arrival.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. I.â Frant S.
Butterworth, Berkeley's football conch, ar
rived to-nicht on the Northern overland
from New Haven and went directly to his
quarters at the Palace. He was met at the
mole by a large deputation of enthusias
tic university students, who roundly
cheered the great fullback and warmly
welcomed his return.
Captain Ransome and ex- Captain Sher
man were among those who met him at
the mole. Manager 1 Reinhardt went to
Port Costa this afternoon, where he met
Butterworth and accompanied him to San
Francisco. The coach looked as hale and
hearty and as full of vigor as ever. He
said that he had a dusty ride from Chicago
out and that he was glad to reach Califor
nia again.
"My father is on his way oat," said
Butterworth, "to stamp the State for Me-
Kmley. I left him yesterday at Chey
enne, where he had been engaged to
speak. H e has dates all along the line,
and I do not expect that he will reach the
coast until about the 10th. As for foot
ball, there will be practically nothing new
this year over last in the system of coach
ing. Perhaps we will do a 1 ttle more
Kicking, and will play harder in the pre
liminary games than we did last year.
The contests that we.enter with other
club teams will be more in the nature of
match games than for mere practice.
"But little gymnasium work will be
done, I think, unless Mr. Magee of the
department of physical culture advises
otherwise. We will probably do most of
our training on the Held. - I will no over
to Berkeley in the morning and will spend
the afternoon with the players getting
ready for the game of Saturday with the
Reliance."
When asKed as to the . truth in the
widely spread rumor that he had been re
cently married, Butterworth said: "No,
it is not true. lam still leading a life' of
single blessedness."
The Volunteers' Sleeting.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. I.â Mrs. Balling
ton Booth of the Volunteers spoke at the
Exposition building to-night to a moder
ate audience. Rev. Dr. McLean intro
duced Mrs. Booth, who was accompanied
by Major Blackhurst and other officers
from San Jose and San Francisco. â¢
Dr. McLean said there was ample room
for the new movement, as it came very
near to the Christian â  church. He regard
ed Mrs. Booth as an energetic champion
of woman's rights.
Mrs. Booth said she wished it under
stood that the Volunteers were not a split
from the Salvation Army. She said they
were an independent organization and had
special lines of work thai had hitherto
not been entered. *"We were dismissed
from the Salvation Army," she said, ."and
although all the property of the army in
this country was in my husband's name
we left it all and would not have started
this work if it had not been forced upon
us."

THE HERMIT HAD AN HEIR
Alviso's Mystery of the Marsh
Still a Long Way From
Being Solved.
Since Purchasing the Ark and Gov
ernment Bonds O.d George Emery
Has Disappeared.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 1. J
A search is being made in this city for a
brother of George Rodman, the hermit of
Alviso, who was found dead in his ark at
that place last week. It has been reported
that the fortune which old Rodman had
in his ark consisted of Government bonds,
which footed up into tne thousands.
Walter Oakes, the operator at Alviso, is
quite well acquainted with the vagaries of
the old hermit.
"for years he has lived in that ark,"
said Mr. Oakes to-day, "and I do not
think any one ever went on board in all
that time. Rodman used to keep guard
with a shotgun, and he frightened off any
one who went within a quarter of a mile
of bis floating home. He was frightened
of being robbed, and undoubtedly had
money on the ark, because tome of the
people here claim to have seen some of
the Government bonds that he held.
"The only man that was ever seen with
Rodman was George Emery, who was
known around there as 'Big George.'
George passed most of his time around
there in saloons, and never seemed to
have more than enough money to pay for
a drink. A soon as he learned" that Rod
man was uead George managed to get a
twenty-dollar piece from somewhere, and
alter the inquest he bought the old ark of
the Coroner of Santa Clara for $10. Since
that time no one has seen George, and no
bo iy seems to know where he has gone.
"A yis-it was made to the ark lately, and
there is not a single thing left on board.
It has been completely ransacked aloft
and below, fore and aft. Whatever the
old man had George got and has gone
away with it. The ark is one of the most
dilapidated things afloat, and the old
miser lived in it for years. An effort is
nbw being made to find a brother oi old
Hodman, who is supposed to be an attor
ney living in Oakland."
There is no attorney in this city named
Rodman, and no one can be found who
ever heard of a lawyer of that name.

New Constitution to Be Adopted While
Delegates From Twenty-Three
Councils Are in Session.
Oakland Office San FbanciscoCall,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 1. )
Pieasanton will be a lively place when
the Grand Lodge of the Portuguese Union
of the State of California convenes there
next Tuesday.
The union had its birth in this county,
being organized at San Leandro August 1,
1880. It has steadily increased until it
contains now a membership of about 1700
distributed in twenty-three councils in
several parts of (he State, from Mendo
cino to Hanford and from Halfnioon Bay
to Sacramento. Its objects are the mu
tual protection of the families of its mem
bers, and its workings are similar to the
A. 0. U. W. It issues a policy of insur
ance of $1400, payable at the death of a
member to his beneficiaries. If, however,
the member is married and his wife dies,
he receives $400 on account of said policy
at the death of the wife.
It is also a fraternal society. It is op
tional with the councils to provide lor
sick benefits in case of the sickness of its
members. During the past sixteen years
of its existence it has cost only about $150

MANY MILLIONS
IN THE MIS
Rich Deposits of Gold and
Silver in Southern
California.
Editor Edelsten of Los Angeles
Tells of Untold Wealth in
the Hills.
AHEAD OF AFRICA AND ALASKA
Interesting Report of an Expert Metal
lurgist, Who Has Just Tra
versed the Field.
F. W. Edelsten, editor of the Lob Ange
les Mining and Metallurgical Journal, is in
the City on a visit. Mr. Edelsten is one
of the best-informed men in the State on
the condition of mining throughout South
ern California. The following description
of the condition of mining enterprises
was prepared by Mr. Edelsten expressly
for The Call:
Mining in Southern California, South
ern Nevada and, in fact, through the
Southwest is going through the same pro
cess of progress as has been Vie case with
other mining sections, possibly less fa
vored in mineral resources, but more ac
cessible. All the desert region, compris
ing a portion or the seven southern coun
ties of California and Nevada, together
with Western Arizona and Lower Califor
nia, was looked over in a way fifteen yearÃ
ago, but at that time silver and lead min
ing were more attractive to both the capi
talist and the prospector than low-grade
gold mines, and in the early eighties it
was not safe to go too far away from a
settlement on account of the Apaches,
who resented any intrusion within hun
dreds of miles of their reservations. They
had a way of disposing of the hardy pros
pector which did not make farther inves
tigation in that particular locality very
attractive to others.
There were many other disadvantages
in the early days, such as high transporta
tion by wagon, scarcity of fuel aud water,
high price of laDor and livine and igno
rance of processes to work the rebellious
ores. All these difficulties have disap
peared now, tne mining districts are con
nected with the outside world by rail
roads, the discovery of oil in large quan
tities in Southern California has solved
the fuel question, and water has been dis
covered in nearly all localities where in
telligent search has been made for it,
either by piping from springs or rivers or
by sinking. Labor ana provisions are as
reasonable now in the Southwest as in
any other mining districts. The many
new processes that have within the last
ten years been discovered make it possible
to work ores with a profit. The gasoline
engine has been a great factor in the de
velopment of the desert mines, as it re
quires but little fuel and no boiler or
large supply of water for steam.
The bullion product of California in
1895 was $15,334,000 gold and $599,000
siiver. Oi the $599,000 produced la sliver
$456,953 51 was obtained in five counties in
Southern California. Inyo County pro
duced $188,329 23, Kern $46,064 28, River
side $2550, San Bernardino $219,410 30 and
San Diego County $600. Much of the
silver produced occurred a* a by-product
in gold ores that would not pay to work
for the silver value alone.
It is not generally known that Califor
nia was formerly a large silver- producer,
but silver at 65 cents per ounce is nut very
stimulating to the industry. In 1880 Cali
fornia produced $1,150,887 in silver; in
1883. $1,400,000; in ISB4, $3,000,000; in 1885,
$3,500,000. These figures show conclu
sively that it is the low price of silver
alone that keeps, the production down.
There are, also, many siiver mines which
contain gold, from which the gold could
be extracted if the silver could be taken
out without a loss, hut the gold value is
not sufficient to warrant the expense of
opening Hem up. Ban Francisco has long
been known as a mining center, and I was
lately told by a prominent mining broker
that it was still comparatively easy to
trade in Comstoct stocks, although most
of the value in tne ores of the Comstock
mines is silver.
The wonderful growth of mining in the
Southwest has proved a great benefit to
Los Angeles, and there is now located in
that city a mining and slock exchange
that would be a credit to a much older
aud more important mining center.
Mining in the past has often been con
sidered by the more conservative business
man something to deal in lightly and not
let the outside world know even the small
amount dealt in. Many business men in
the East, however, derive large revenues
from their holdings in the mines, yet they
keep the matter very quiet because they
consider it might injure their credit in the
commercial world. This fact makes it
very difficult to obtain reliable data about
tbe amounts invested in mines, for those
who Have good-paying mines are satisfied
and have nothing to gain by enlightening
tbe general public concerning theit invest
ments, while those who have made un
profitable speculations use every means in
their power to keep the matter quiet. I
have investigated the matter of mining
investments in Southern California, Ari
zona and Mexico very thoroughly and
give some figures that may be of interest.
In Los Angeles County there are up
ward of 500 people engaged in mining
with a capital of over $3,000,000 invested in
the county and other places. Los Angeles
County has eight mills at work, Kern
County 25 mills and over 800 working
miners, Riverside County 30 mills and
1200 miners, San Bernardino 35 mills and
1500 miners, San Diego 20 mills and 1000
.miners. The Golden Cross mill in San
Diego County has a 140-stamp mill which
is the second largest in the State. South
ern California alone is a very busy mining
country with more than 125 mills of 900
stamp capacity and about 3000 miners
working for wages, while the number en
gaged in mining both for wages and other
wise is about 6500. The capital invested in
the mines of Southern California is es
timated to be over $15,500,000. From this
brief statement of iacts it will be seen
that right at home the mining industry i 3
one of considerable magnitude and full of
activity.
In Arizona, whose trade is all tributary
to this coast, the extent and richness of
the mining country is very great. Mo
have County is the leader in the produc
tion of gold and silver, while Yavapai, the
next county, is fast coming to the front.
The Congress mine, one of the lareest gold
producers in the Southwest, is located in
Yavapai County. The great copper com
paniesâJerome, Big Bug, Bumble Bee,
Crown King, Tip Top and Yarnell, ail
great mineral-producing camps â are also
in Yavapai Coun'y. Yuma County,
which adjoins rian Diego County on the
east, contains many good mining dis
tricts, among them Tyson's, Harrisbu.-g,
Ehrenburg and Harqua Hala, the great
mine which was sold for a million and a
nuarter, and the Fortuna mine, which was
bold as a prospect for $150,000. Pinal, Co
chise, Graham, Apache and Coconino are
other rich counties of Arizona which are
producing large wealth and give promise
of much wore in the extensive prospect
ing going on.
In the republic of Mexico the mining
possibilities are on a scale well-nigh incon
ceivable. The States of Sonora, Sinaloa,
Chihuahua, JJurango and Baja California
Â»re enormously wealthy, and are as yet
virtually virgin territory, though many
rich mines are now being worked. It is of
interest to note, in passing, the
number of loreign rniuing companies
winch are operating in the Southwest and
the large amount of money they have in
vested. Among the larger ones may be
mentioned the Abaris Mining Corpora
tion, with a capital of $1,000,000. whose
mine is at Zacatecas, and for which $625,000
was paid; the Almada and Territo Com
pany, capital $312,000. mines at Alruos, So
nora; tne Anglo-Mexican Mining Com
pany, owning the Yedras mines in Sinaloa,
for which $1,401,625 was paid, the capital
of the company being $2,001,625; the Ari
zona Copper Company, with a capital of
$3,575,000; the Bac.is gold and silver
mines oi Darango, Mexico, capital $1,000,
--000, and property for which $650,000 was
paid; the Big Creek Mining Company of
Lander County, Nevada, which has a capi

--000 for its property; the Bravo Mine
Syndicate at Pinos Altos, Chihuahua,
Mexico, with a capital of $90,000; the
Buster Mines Syndicate, in the Peck min
ing district, Arizona, which paid $00,000
for its property and has a capital of $75,
--000; the Canada del Oro mines in Arizona,
capital $150,000, property purchased for
$92,500; Catalina gold mines in
the Old Hat mining district, Ari

--000 was raid; the Garfield Company, in
Nevada, capital $500,000; Grand Central
silver mines, in New Mexico, with a capi

which cost $930,000; tbe Harqua Haia
Gold Mining Company, capital $1,500,000;
the Holcomb Valley Company, in San
Bernardino County, capital $675,000; the
Lynx Creek Gold and Land Company,
with properties near Phoenix, Arizona,
and also in Bear Valley, San Bernardino
County, costing $210,000, and a capital of
$300,000; the Mammoth gold mine?, in
Pinal County, Arizona, capital $2,500,000;
the Mexican Smelting. Mining and Land

paid $1,500,000 for its property and has a
capital of $4,000,000; the Panal Consoli
dated Gold and Silver mine 9, in Chibua
liua, Mexico, capital $650,000 and prop
erty that cost $600,000; Picacho Gold
Mines, with property that cost $900,000
and a capital of $1,000,000; the Rich Hill
gold mines, in the Weaver district,
Yavapai County, Ariz., which paid $350,
--000 for its properties and whose capital is
$400,000; the San Jacinto Estate, which
has properties in San Bernardino County
for which $1,650,000 was paid and a cap
ital of $2,775,000.
The showing of foreign investment Is a
remarkable array and should be a vigor
ous incentive to spur us on to retaining in
our own country and for our own people
as much as possible of the vast wealth
which the thrifty foreigner so eagerly
grasps.
Probably one of the greatest mining
countries that will be known is close to
Los Angeles and is as yet almost entirely
undeveloped, owing to the lack of trans
portation facilities. This is Southern
Utah, and it is inevitable that within a
very few years that great country will be
open to Los Angeles and the coast
through the construction of the Salt Lake
railroad. The mineral prospects of this
portion of the great Southwest are almost
limitless. Gold, silver and copper abound,
and it is no exaggeration to say that there
are mountains of coal and the best iron
only waiting for a means of transporta
tion to reach a market. Added to these,
asphalt and petroleum are found in large
quantities.
Mining is, through the systematic
means now being used, fast becoming one
of the most important as well as legit
imate industries of. California, and many
who looked upon mining as a gamble a
few years ago are eagerly looking for an
investment in a good mine, as the fact is
slowly dawning on the public that gold
mining is one of the few industries in
which competition does not lower prices.
The miner creates new wealth for himsel.
and tiie world at large and injures no com
petitor while engaged in his businessf
The climate of the Pacific Coast and South
west is one of the most favorable on the
face of the globe for mining, with no se
vere winters to shut the miner in the
mountains for s-ix months in the year.
In summing up the Southwest as a
mining country I can say that it has the
brightest prospects of any section I know
of, and after the American miner has
overcome t:ie fascination of starving on
the African deserts and freezing in Alaska
he can come to the Southwest and Pacific
Coast and find mines of higher grade,
where he can have most of the comforts of
life and take out th? wealth that is locked
up in the mountains to benefit the con
dition of mankind.
MINING NOTES.
The Calaveras Prospect haa learned
from a reliable source that the Sheffield
Consolidated Mining Company, owners of
the old Conteras mine, have a two-stamp
Henley mill run by steam power. They
have a shaft down about thirty-five leet.
In July they commenced running a tun
nel, which is now about forty-five feet be
low the shaft. They have struck the main
lead in the tunnel, but it is not solid, only
five or six inches of qnartz appearing.
The walls are about two leet apart. This
is considered one of the best prospects so
far on the north side of tl;e north fork of
the Mokelumne River. The mill is not
running regularly, but the company
crushes about six tons of rock every
twenty-four hours when it does run.
The California Debris Commissioners
have granted the owners of the Alcyone
mine near Angels permission to build re
straining dams across San Domingo Creek.
The creek is a tributary of the Calaveras
River.
Mr. Zeek of the Zeek mine at Butte City
is laying the foundation for a ten-stamp
mill, which he expects to have completed
in about three weeks. They are running
a tunnel 175 feet to tap the old shaft,
which is down about 200 feet. The rock
taken from this shaft averages about $8 a
ton.
The trestle on the Mary H. Thompson
mine in the Marsh ranch on the Calaveras
River is fipished and the machinery is in
place. It is expected that ali the details
will be perfected so that work can begin
by the 15th of October. The management
is pleased with the outlook, and antici
pates good results when the work begins.
At the Kennedy mine the new ievel
opened up at 2150 feet has encountered the
ore body and the same is found to be
equal in size and fully as rich as that
worked in the 1950 level. This is highly
satisfactory, not merely as affording 200
feet of ore to operate upon, but more par
ticularly as proving that the pay-chute of
this vicinity reaches far into the bowels of
the earth. It has been the impression,
says the Amador Republican, that on the
mother lode the sold-bearing quartz does
not extend below 2000 feet The Kennedy
mine is a practical refutation of this
theory, and the experience thus gained
cannot fail to nave great weight in the
future of the mining industry in this
county.
There is talk of starting up the Farrell
mine and mill of "Rosenburgh," a mile
below Middle Bar, on t;ie Mokelumne
River, says the Amador Republican. This
is the last mine on the mother lode, in
Amador County, and _as a tine mill in
good order, also several houses. The mine
has produced as rich ore with heavy sul
phurets as any mine in this county two
or three years ago, but has been idle for
some time, but one of the Rosenburghsof
Oakland will be here this week with the
view of starting up this mine.
A mining deal of large proportions is
about to be consummated in the Pioneer
District. Tbe Amador Republican reports
that Chicago parties are negotiating for
the Madrone mine, also Casinelli's group
of mines, including the famous Pioneer.
Considerable money will change hands
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1896.
and the camp looks forward to a long
period of renewed activity. The minÂ«s
in this section are all higi grade and of
unknown extent. Surface development
has exposed countless ledges, all of which
are more or less rich in free gold, and not
one of thÂ«*m has been followed to any
Krcat depth. In the deepest shaft sunk
the veins retain this high-grade quality.
Tbe owners being for the most part men
of limited means have been unable to
contend with water and hard ground, and
only recently, since the attention of capi
tÂ»l has been drawn to the mining indus
try as a legitimate investment, has this
district received its share of respect as a
mining camp. Responsible mining men
are beginning t6 realize that here there is
a comparatively iin prospected belt of
mineral which has the possibility of
equaling any on the coast.
According to the Calaveras Citizen all
the timber and machinery for the new
forty-stamp miil at the Gwin mine is on
the ground and the mill is well under way.
Captain F. F. Thomas says that the
stamps will be dropping by the first of
November. This will be one of the best
constructed mills in the State when com
pleted, li will cover an area of 74 by 90
feet, and the foundation, which is on bed
rocfc, is overlaid with cement of tne most
durable quality. The plant will be
operated by water power under a tremen
dous pressure. The water will be taken
from the Campo Seco and Mokelumne
Hill Company's ditch at a point about 800
feet from the miil, having a fall of over
400 feet in that distance. The develop
ment of the mine has cost the company
an enormous sum, but they feel confident
that their outlay will be amply repaid.
Development work on the Gold Hill
mine at Srnitn's Flat is under good head
way. It is the intention of tbe manage
ment of this property to sink the shaft to
a depth of 500 feet before running levels.
The old Petticoat mine at Railroad Flat is
about to start up under the management
of W. H. Claiy Jr. A hoist is being erected
and other work being done preparatory
to cleaning out the old shaft.
BUILDING THE ORGAN.
Work on tbe Grand Instrument in St.
Ignatius Hag Begun.
The preparatory work for the construc
tion of the grand new organ in St. Igna
tius Church has so far advanced within
the last week that the vestibule front of
the church has been completely changed
in appearance. Where the public gallery
stood there is a series of massive steel
girders, and the old organ loft Higher up
has been cut away. These changes are
necessary to make room for the magnifi
cent instrument from Detroit, which is
already in course of construction under
the direction of W. D. Wood of Detroit,
who has a National reputation in his spe
cialty of organ-building.
The wind machinery with its electric
motors has been erected in a room in the
east tower away from the church audi
torium. This apartment is called the
machinery room. It contains two distinct
bellows, each in massive frames of pol
ished wood and supplied with chain pul
leys by which power is transmitted from
the motors. One set contains in itself four
sets of bellows for furnishing air for the
main body of the organ. A five-horse
power motor gives the power. While one
motor will have the potential works, the
other set is intended to supply the great
solo pipes witli air. At one side there is
an elaborate switchboard with two sets oi
storage batteries.
When ti;e organist wishes to play he
simply touches a button in the organ gal
lery and presently the electric machinery
off in tnis room is started. By automatic
devices the supply ol air is regulated with
out the attention of an attendant, and at
the close the touching of another button
stops the motors and liberates the air.
In about a week ihe new gallery will be
finished and then the organ-builders will
begin to erect the graDd instrument,
which will tower thirty-six feet in tne air
almost to the ceiling. There is to be no
delay from then until the organ is tin
islied, which will be close to Christmas
day.

THE MYSTERY .
OF A MILKCAN
Members of Three Families
Made Sick by Drink
ing the Contents.
Suspicion Was Held Concerning
Poison, but an Analysis
Showed No Result.
ALL SYMPTOMS IDENTICAL.
The Remaining Milk Will Be Testrd
Once More by the Health
Authorities.
Three families were made sick Tuesday
night by drinking milk, all of which came
from one can, this can having been
brought from a dairy in San Mateo
County to Becker's grocery-store on the
southeast corner of Sutter and Taylor
streets. Four persons residing in the
tenement above Becker's store were made
ill. Two of these are Mr. Becker's young
daughters. Two others are ladies from
the interior, a Mrs. Watson and her
daughter. Mr. and Mrs. Becker were ab
sent from the City, so they did not drink
any of the milk, but a young man who is
employed in tiie Becker store, William
Kroencke, suffered.
Two physicians, Drs. Bunker and Davis,
whose offices are in the neighborhood,
worked about all Tuesday night and until
S o'clock yesterday morning in at
tendance upon Mrs. E. F. Dugan
and her daughter of 632 Sutter
street. They were worse than the mem
bers of the Beckei household. As they
were sick after drinking the milk,
the connection was clearly established in
their cpses. Another family on Sutter
street, near Jones, drank the milk and
were made ill.
When the physicians and their several
clients compared notes yesterday it was
found that me symptoms were identical
in all the cases. All the persona appeared
to have been poisoned, but the probabil
ities were otherwise against such a sup
position. It is true ;hat the milkcan was
placed in an areaway some nours beiore
Becker's ?tore was oiened, and there was
ample opportunity for any one to tamper
with it, but it was not thought to be prob
able that any one would poison a whole
can of milk and place in peril many un
known persons. When thf driver of the
Sau Mateo concern, which had supplied
the milk, came around Wednesday he was
surprised to hear what Had occurred. He
took away what was left in the ruilkcan to
have it analyzed by the authorities at the
City Hall.
Mrs. Dugan is the- mother of Mr. Dugan,
the druggist and chemist, whose p. ace of
business is on the southwest corner of
Taylor and Sutter streets, directly opposite
Becker's. Some milk remaining in his
mother's house, be caused an analysis of
it to be made in his store.
A search first was made for arsenic,
strychnine and morphia. No traces of any
mineral or other poison were discovered,
and !a*t night the secret of the illness of
Mrs. Dugan and the others remained un
explained, but t ere was no question that
the milk caused it.
Most of the milk went into tea, so that
no one drank very much. This ie consid
ered to have been especially fortunate, for
the majorky of the victims were very ill.
Four were not fully recovered last night,
the two ladies frora the country and Mrs.
Dugan and her daughter. All the symp
toms were similar to poisoning cases.
Mr. Kroencke drank the milk at noon
and was sick in the afternoon. The others
had the milk at night and were sick some
hours later. One or two others are re
ported to have suffered slightly, but this
is not verified.
The Can in which the liquid was taken
to Becker's was an ordinary three-^alion
affair. There is no suspicion concerning
any person. The general opinion in the
neighborhood is tuat the miik was unlit
to drink when it was delivered.
SUED FOR DIVORCE.
Mrs. Winnie L. Hresse Says Her Hus-
band Has X>eserted Her.
Mrs. Winnie L. Bresse, whose husband,
a member of the firm of Lewis McGlauflin
&, Co., disappeared over a year ago, nas
brought suit for divorce on the ground of
desertion.
Bresse has not been heard from since
June, 1895, when he so mysteriously
dropped out of sight. He has not com
municated with his wife or with any one
else us far as is known. Mrs. Bresse is the
daughter of Harbor Commissioner Cole.

,The Man Who Tries to Lok Like
Christ Talked Germ > a to
an Irish Lady.
As early as 7 o'clock yesterday morning
a stream of people of all descriptions ana
conditions set in toward the little upper
front room in the International Hotel
whica is occupied by Schrader, the "di
vine healer."
A force of employes of the hotel were
called into requisi ion to keep tne stream
in the common channels of the hotel and
prevent its overflowing into all the hall
ways of the upper floor and becoming a
mob. The people were required to keep
in line and the line extended Irom the
sidewalk down the hall, up the winding
stairs, along the upper hallways to the
healer's room.
The healer's room is a small affair, with
cheap faded furnishings, a small single
bed. two chairs, a washstand and abureau.
In the center of this room stood the
heaier all day affecting to cure or relieve
by "the laying on of nands" as rapidly as
the peopie came forward. His appear
ance was calculated to affect the impres
sionable by its likeness to that of Christ â
the generally accepted likeness of Christ.
A little above medium height, slim figure,
clad in a Mowing black robe, a rather hand
some face, the features large and regular,
mild brown eyes, a kindly but not a weak
expression, brown whiskers and long hair
parted in the middle. A silver crucifix
was suspended by a cord from his neck
and across his breast was a black ribbon
with stitched upon it the legend: "Divine
Healer Scurader."
The methods were all those of Schlatter,
the Denver healer, with the addition of a
sale of photographs going on all the time
as a side isÂ«ue.
The "Divine Healer." who has got
himself up to so closely resrmble Christ,
took in not less than $100 yesterday with
out so far as appeared effecting a solitary
cure. He charges nothing, but his "man
ager" or "agent" is stationed at the door,
and as each of the afflicted retires after the
"treatment' 1 he or she is asked. if they
wish to buy a photograph. The photo
graph which he offers shows the healer in
different poses.
The price being asked the agent answers :
"Anything that you wish to give." This
thrown the "healed" upon his or her gen
erosity, and the result averages higher
than would a fixed price for the card. For
instance, the first man to apply to the
healer yesterday morning was Julius
Finck of Will & Finck, suffering with and
hoping to be relieved from rheumatism.
When he met the man at the door with
his photographs he handed him ass gold
piece.
The next man or woman may have
given him 10 cents and may have passed
out without taking a photograph at all.
But those who did that were few, and it is
safe to average 25 cents for every man,
woman and otiitd who passed in and out
of the little upper room during the day,
and the stream was uninterrupted, except
for the brief periods that the healer took
for his meals.
The stream of people, as stated, repre
sented all conditions of people suffering
with all manner of complaints, only a
few of which latter were stated. A large
proportion were well-dressed and seem
ingly well-to-do men and women. There
were lame and deaf and blind, old people
on crutches and children in arms. Indeed
there were several who were treated by
proxy, being unabie to go themselves, a
mother or some near friend representing
them and carrying awny to the sufferer a
handkerchief that had been blessed.
The "treatment," aÂ» the healer himself
called it, occupied but a minute in each
case. The afflicted person stepped forward
from his place at the nead "of the line.
The healer placed one large hand upon
the forehead and another at the back of
the head, and pressing them closely for
an instant, looked with wrapt gaze toward
the ceiling. Then be would change the
position of the hands to the right brenst
and the shoulder blade, then to the left
breast relatively, tuen to the stomach.
Then he would take the two hands and
hold them in his own for another instant,
[ looking upward again. Then he leans
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1896.
forward and in a soft voice asks "Have
you a handkerchief?"
The sufferer produces a handkerchiefâ
sometimes a very dirty one â and the
healer molds it as he would a piece of
putty in his hands, clasps it tightly and
again looks upward for an instant in the
attitude of prayer. Then, placing it in
the patient's hands he says:
"Take this; apply it to the affected parts
night and morning until you are well.
God bless you."
He is then ready for the next. During
the entire day the healer never forgets his
demeanor of extreme quiet and composure,
although instances were not wanting cal
culated to cause him to do so.
Having gone through his formula in the
case ol a man who complained of being
hard of hearing he said in a low tone,
"Where do you live?"
The man put bis hand to his ear.
"Where do you live?" said Schrader.
The man drew closer and held bis hand
wider open to catch the sound. Schrader
repeated a little louder and the man
caught the words.
Schrader said, "I am not talking loud."
"Yes, but I am very close to you," said
the man.
"Yes, indeed," said Schrader, devoutly,
"You are very close to me."
A big, healthy - looning gray - haired
woman stepped up to the healer, and he
addressed her in his low voice in German.
"What's that?" she asked. The divine
healer said it again, and the woman an
swered even more mystified.
'â¢You are German?" inquired the healer.
"No, I am Irish," replied the astonished
old lady with a distinct and musical
brogue.
In very many instances the sufferers
confessed to feeling Detter after the treat
ment, and all were assured that by follow
ing the directions to apply the blessed
handkerchief they would get well, and al
most all went away looking as if they be
lieved that they would. A number of
people came on crutches, but in every in
stance they returned on them also.
ATTORNEYS FALL OUT,
Lawyers in the Quill Damage
Suit Wrangle Over
Testimony.
Evidence Is Given by a Small Boy
Alleged to Have Been Bought
for a Pass
For a few moments yesterday it looked
as though the cat was out of the bag in the
Quill suit. The attorneys for the plaintiff
and the lawyers representing the railroad
bristled up and suggested to one another
that each was running his own case to suit
himself, and that the others had better
mind their own business.
The controversy arose over a question
asked AJlyn Tenipleton by the plaintiff's
attorney. He was requested to give his
opinion as to the truth of the testimony
of the Smith boy, given at the Coroner's
inquest.
As soon as the name Smith was men
tioned the Southern Pacific's legal repre
sentative leaped to his feet and poured
forth a voluble objection.
It was alleged that the other side was
afraid to put the lad on the stand, and
offers to reopen the case were made if it
would do so. Then Attorney Sullivan
offered to produce the pass the boy Is said
to have received. This occasioned another
war, whicn was finally stopped by Judge
Daingerlield ruling out the question.
There were four witnesses examined
yrsterday, and ibe case will go on again
to-day.
DAIRYMEN DIRECTORS.
Close ot the Third Annual Session.
Officer* Are .Elected.
The Dairymen's Association closed its
third annual meeting at 12 o'clock yester
day.
The proceedings of the forenoon con
sisted of a paper by A. H. Shrite, in which
California creamery matters were com
pared with those of the East. William
Vanderbiit made suggestions as to amend
ments to the dairy laws by the next legis
lature, which would establish a general
system of inspection of dairies, and a code
of laws regulating the State's right to de
stroy diseased cattle, instead of leaving so
important a subject to the control of local
boards of health, as is the cat<e now.
To this end the legislative committee
was instructed to confer with dairymen,
veterinary surgeons an I otbers, and to
prepare a bill for presentation to the Legis
lature for the inspection of - dairies and
herds, to secure pure dairy products.
Secretary Samuel E. Watson read his
annual report, after which the following
named were elected directors for the
ensuing year: William Niles, A.P.Mai
tin, Samuel E. Watson, Joseph Maiilard
F. H. Green. W. P. A. Brewer, M. P. Han
sen, H. M. Le Baron, P. Tognazzini, John
A. Cole and G. R. Bneath.

was picked up and taken to the Receiving
Hospital. The doctors found that his back

BLYTHE PROPERTY
IS ATTACHED
Capitalist John D. Eaton
Garnishees for a Big
Claim.
He Leaned Florence Blythe
$10,000 When Funds Were
Very Scarce.
A SUIT WAS FILED YESTERDAY
Attorney Mhoon Tells Why the Legal
Proceedings Were Begun at
This Time.
The many and valuable properties of
Mrs. Florence lilythe Hinckley are again
in the hands of the Sheriff, this time on
the suit of Capitalist John D. Eaton of
this City, who wants satisfaction for a
claim of $25,000.
During the dark days when a horde of
Blythes were battling in the Probate
Court for a share of the millions of the de
ceased Thorna* Blytht, Mr. Eaton mate
rially assisted Mrs. Blythe Hinckley, then
Miss Blythe.
Among other things, he advanced her
$10,000 in cash to carry on her legal fight,
and for this and other services she agreed
to pay him $25,000 when she should come
into her property.
The happy day when she could handle
the larger portion of her millions came
some time ago, but no settlement with the
capitalist has ever been reached and he
has begun to be anxious. To secure him
self against loss he recently instructed
Attorney John B. Mhoon to file a suit
against her covering the claim. The filing
of a complaint in the Superior Court and
twenty-seven attachments with the Sheriff
was the result yesterday.
Major Mhoon was seen in Oakland last
night ana said: "The garnishments filed
by me to-day on behalf of Mr. Eaton
amount in value to $25,000. Some years
ago Mr. Eaton, who is a capitalist, per
formed some very material services for
Miss Florence Blythe. At one time he
loaned her $10,000 "and has rendered her
many other services.
"In return for these she entered into a
written contract with him guaranteeing to
pay him $25,000 when the estate should be
distributed. Slie now has the property,
or a great portion ot it, and Mr. Eaton has
not yet been able to procure a satisfactory
settlement. As a last resort I was in
structed to bring suit and to issue garnish
ments against her property.
"I have attached all the realty that I
believe she owns. This step was rendered
necessary, because Mrs. Hinckley is exe
cuting many mortgages and deeds, and
Mr. Eaton is not at all confident that he
might npt be forgotten till his chance of
satisfaction is past. It would be us le-s
to wait until we could find nothing to at
tach." _________^_

A DAY'S TURN IN
A BANK'S ASSETS
It Leads to an Attempt to
Recover a Large
Sum.
Captain "Jim" Is Asked to Help
Pay Seventy - Five
Thousand.
SOMEWHAT SENSATIONAL SUIT
The Attorney .General Wishes the
Bank Commissioner: to Join in
the Proceedings.
Andrew J. Clunie, as attorney for P. F.
Dundon, a depositor in the Pacific Bank,
will try to demonstrate next Monday In
Judge Se wall's court that the depositors
of that institution are entitled to recover
$75,000 from James M. McDonald and the
directors of the bank. The allegations
made by Mr. Clunie in this suit are in
substance as follows:
That James M. McDonald on August 1,
1895, caused 150 bonds of the par value of
$1000 each, or $150,000 in total, to be soli
for $75,000; that the purchaser was 8. G.
Murphy ; that on the succeeding day,
namely, August 2, 1895, S. G. Murphy di
rected the Bank of California, which was
the depository in which the bonds in
question were all held, to deliver the
same to James M. McDonald; that, as a
matter oJ fact, the bond? were worth par,
or $150,000, and that Captain McDonald in
this transaction really cleared up $75,000
by a turn in the securities of the Pacific
Bank for his own profit; therefore the
court is asked to award $75,000 to the de
positors, of whom P. F. Dundon is one.
The somewhat sensational nature of this
proceeding ia increased by the action
which the Btate of California, through the
Board of Bank Commissioners, may take.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald has consid
ered the facts which have been presented
to him and advised the Bank Commission
ers to join with the depositors of the bank
in this attempt to recover $75,000 from
Captain McDonald.
The general facts connected with- the
alleged transaction possess interest for the
Pacific Bank depositors, and perhaps not
less for the public at large. S. G. Murphy
at the time the bonds, which were the
issue of the Los Angeles Consolidated
Electric Railway Company, came into his
hands, was the San Francisco agent of the
National Bank of Commerce of New York,
to which institution the Pacific Bank owed
$100,000 in round numbers.
The sale of the bonds was entered
upon the minutes of the directors of
the bank as having been maue to effect
a settlement with the National Bank of
Commerce of New York of their claim at
something less than its face value. It is
alleged that when the bonds were handed
back into the custo ly of Captain McDon
ald, one day after Captain McDonald had
transferred them to S. G. Murphy. Mc-
Donald paid over $75,000, which went to
New York and left him in possession ot
the 150 bonds at 50 cents on the dollar of
their face or par value.
Captain McDonald, at the time the Pa
cific Bank failed, held about 1700 shares of
the capital stock of that institution. He se
cured possession of the stock owned by
IÂ»r. McDonald, amountine to 5000 shares,
and this large block of stock, added to his
own holding, gave him a large share of
control during the period of winding up
the bank's affairs. The Los Angeles Elec
tric Consolidated Railway bonds were, at
the time of the failure, pledged to the
National Bank of Commerce of New York.
A part of the testimony upon which Mr.
Clunie relies to establish his claim is found
in the admission of Captain McDonald
when he was under cross-examination be
fore Judge Hebbard in another proceeding
connected with the bank litigation and
also upon the action of S. G. Murphy.
The defense will probably be that the rail
way bonds were never worth par of $1000
each.
LALANDE'S HOME COMING
His Return Will Inaugurate
Changes at the French
Consulate.
Edward Pesoh, the Acting Consul,
Goes to Philadelphia as
Vice-Consul.
There will shortly be a complete change
in the present personnel of the French
consulate in this City.
For nearly a year Laurence de Lalande,
the French Consul, has been away in the
East and in France. While he was absent
the Vice- Consul, Edward A. Pesoh, has
had complete charge of the consulate.
Lalandi is expected bnck in a few days,
however, and when he resumes his duties
Pesoli will retire permanently from any
connection with the San Francisco con
sulate. When questioned on the subject
yesterday Vice-Consul Pesoli admitted
that he expected in the course of a day or
two to become a private citizen as far as
the Pacific Coast is concerned.
This means that the changes gazetted
by the French Government during the
absence of Lulande in France, will now
come into effect. E. Pesoli is to go to
Philadelphia, where he will have charge
of the vice consulate there. The change
will be a decided promotion for him, as
Philadelphia has a large trade with
France and is considered one of the best
American consulates at the bestowal of
the French Government.
The position left vacant by E. Pesoli
here will be filled by M. Rigorean, the
Vice Consul at Sidney. He is not ex
pected here for some months. Another
new attache of the consulate here, M.
Chorat, who comes from the French con
sulate at London, has already arrived.
Laurence de Lalande will be the recip
ient of congratulations on his return
home, as be received the Cross of the
Legion of Honor during his stay in France.
A Charter Meeting.
There will be a special meeting of the mem
bers of the Union League at the league's head
quarters this evening, for the consideration
and discussion of the proposed new charter
for San Francisco. The members of the Board
of Freeholders who made the charter have
been invited to attend and speak upon the
various phases of the subject. A large attend
ance is expected, and an interested discussion
upon the City's new organic law.
Honored in His Old Home.
Dr. Giuseppe Ollino, for many years a resi
dent of thi s City, has, according to the Italian
papers, had honors heaped upon him in his
native country, where he is at present staying
on a vis it. The Gazzetta del Popolo of Turin
states that when the doctor visited Roccu
d'Arazzo, his birthplace, the whole population
made the day a holidiy. The leadine club ot
the town, the Vittorio Alfleri, decided to ten
der him a banquet, to which the chief citizens
and all the municipal authorities were in-
Titea.

LOCAL TURF JOTTINGS.
The Berkeley Field-Book Privi
lege Not as Desirable as at
Ingleside.
Jockey Chevalier Entertains an Offer
to Ride in Mexicoâ Pinkerton Men
May Guard the Track.
Bookmaker George Rose now enjoys a
monopoly of the field books, having se
cured the privilege both at Ingleside and
at Berkeley, the new home of the Califor
nia Jockey Club.
For the privilege at Berkeley Mr. Rose
bid $300 per day for two books, and not
$350, as has been incorrectly stated. Ingle
side track came a trifle Higher, the layer
of odds bidding $350 per day for two
books. As a guarantee of good faith
Bookmaker Rose deposited the sum of
$10,000 with tne California Jockey Club
that he would hold to his contract. With
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club $20,000 was
deposited ; that sum, however, not being
required by the club as a guarantee that
the contract would be kept. Of this sum
the amount of tne privilege for each half
monthly meeting will be deducted as the
time for such payment may become due.
The stiing of Burns & Waierhouse, in
charge of "Wizard" Jimmy McCormick,
was expected to arrive in California from
St. Louis last night Although the stable
developed no "phenoms," ita different
members have earned many winning
brackets. Eddie Jones will arrive with the
string.
Jockey Chevalier, it is reported, will go
to Mexico to ride the horses of George Van
Gordon. "No Chinese need apply" is now
posted in the crown of the colored boy's
hat.
It is said that Pinkerton men will re
nlace Morse's guardians of the peace on
one if not Doth of the California tracks.
Martinus, who rodt* several races on the
local tracks last season and now pilots the
jumper St. Jacob in his winning career, is
said to be the peer of any Western jockey
over the timber.
The sprinter Qu.cksilver, who started in
a five-furlong dash the last day of the
Stockton meet but did not win simply
because the mercury in tne thermometer
registered several degrees of temperature
in excess of what he is capable of endur
ine, created a very favorable impression.
With a slacker Jrein he could certainly
have covered the live furlongs that day in
one minute flat. He claims imp. Friar
Tuck as his sire, which horse has also
sired those fa*t ones, Circe, Zamloch awd
Sport McAllister. It is said he will stop if
"collared," but those among the cheaper
lot of selling-platers may experience some
difficulty in dancing to his music the first
quarter of a mile.
A local turf-follower is in receipt of a
letter from an Eastern friend which states
that Midgley is also among the number of
jockeys intending to migrate to the coast
this winter.
Marks Under Arren â  .
Tom Williams, better known as Edward
Marks, Of Oakland, was arrested yesterday on
the authority of an indictment returned by the
United States Grand Jury last Friday, charg
ing him with sending obscene matter through
the malls. Marks, or Williams, is regarded
as the Bill Sykes of the city across tne bay. He
was brought into prominence in August last
through the suicide of Mollie Traynor, a well
known character about Oaklan.l
