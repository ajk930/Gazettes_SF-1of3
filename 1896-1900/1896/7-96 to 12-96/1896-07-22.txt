ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 2i. )
Ninety-five Texan Populist delegates came cavorting up Broad*
â way to-day and took up their headquarters in the Southern Hotel.
They are middle-of-the-road steers and will not allow any Bryan
man to *' shoo " them off the track.
The straight Populists claim 700 of the 1300 delegates. They will
stand by the Omaha platform and nominate a ticket whether they
are in the majority or not.
The bimetallic delegations from California and Nevada arrived
this morning, headed by Sam P. Davis and ex-Senator Frank J. Mof
fitt of the programme wing of the Oakland Democracy. Sam did
some literary work under difficulties, but spared no . xpense, because
he did not want to fall down on his colleague, Ned Hamilton.
Senator Moffitt tackled the Texan delegation with an indecent
proposition to desert their platform and declare for Bryan. They
drank all his wine, smoked all his cigars and exclaimed " Nit,"
whereupon the Senator was grieved.
The National Reform Editorial Association adopted middle-of-the
road resolutions and nailed their colors to the mast.
All the hotels are crowded, prices have gone up and the noise and
discord of debate on political economy afflict the ear in all quarters.
Some remarks are also heard concerning a French revolution and an
American Charlotte Corday. JOHN PAUL COSGRAVE.

"Is the French revolution of 1798 about
to be repeated in America in 1896?" is the
question which one naturally asks as he
surveys the tumultuous mob of orators,
wild-eyed Populists and bronze-cheeked
silver men in the lobbies of the hotels here
in St. Louis.
Cheers were civen several times yester
day when the name of Eugene V. Debs
was proposed for the Presidency. Some
delegates are wearing a button on which

is engraved a portrait of Altgeld of Illi
nois, and much of the argument that is
being made in the lobbies is in a strain
similar to that advanced by Herr Johann
Most, Mr. Aitgeld's pr-ceptor. For the
purposes of an American French revolu
tion Debs would make a good enough
Danton, Most would acceptably fill the
role of Marat, and Altgeld would make a
sufficiently good Robespierre for all prac
ti' al purposes. The Charlotte Corday
would be furnished by the people next
November; her dagger the ballot, which
would wipe out the revolution, rjot as that
ot France was washed out in a bath of
blood, but by the all-availing DOtency of a
sovereign people.

epates, alternates and champions and
2400 silver convention delegates and alter
nates are now on the ground, a most for
midable army. There is no music of brass
bands, no flaunting of rich silken, golden
embroidered and golden tasseled banners,
no flags bearing the portraits of candidates
of the different factions for the two highest
offices in the gift of the people, not any
of the paraphernalia of the ordinary polit
ical convention, but the simple badge
worn on the coat forms the stage setting
for these two ever-to-be memorable gather
ings, while the voice of argument pitched
high and ferociously and the waving of
hats and the shaking of clenched fists are
the only music and beating of time t; at
would harmonize with tuis strange over
ture of political discord.
It is a strange rumbling of inconsisten
cies. Debs, the man who two years ago
led a class revolution against the laws of
the United States and against the recog
nized ritrht of every man to earn 'his bread
by the sweat of his brow, is being urged
for the Presidency of the Nation whose
foundations he bad attempted to under
mine. Altgeld, the man who placed the
gubernatorial seal of approbation upon the
actsofthe bomb-throwing anarchists at the
Chicago Hay market by striking the shack

clothing of three of those murderers, is

IGNATIUS DONNELLY, Scholar and Jluthor. Wfto Stands by the Populist Colors and
Demands an Independent Course.
In outlining his policy to a Call correspondent at St. Louis Mr. Donnelly said: "We believe the People's party is important
to all the people of the world on other questions than that of silver. If we move all our forces into the Democratic boat and the
Eastern wing of that party gets possession of that boat and scuttles it and we all go to the bottom together it would require diving
bells and derricks and grappling-irons to ever put the People's party back where it now stands. We are ready to pat our Demo
cratic friends on the back and call them good boys and tell them that in four years more they will be as enthusiastic over the
demand for Government ownership of railroads aa they are for free silver, and when they resolve (in the language of the Omaha
platform) that wealth belongs to him who creates it, and that every dollar taken from labor without an equivalent is robbery, and
that if any man does not work neither shall he eat, then we will talk about dissolving the People's party and joining their crowd."
Bryan â he a pet of the revolutionists
raised by the breath of a disloyal mob to
the head of the ticket of a great party be
cause he happened to be a good elocution
ist and wept crocodile tears over the
crucifixion of a man of straw upon a cross
of gold. Johann Most is not being cheered,
nor has his name been placed upon the
Democratic ticket for a high position in
the councils of the Nation, but that is be
cause be happens to be a native of a for
eign country and has not sworn allegiance
either to the Democratic or Republican
party.
In ibe Bwdst of all this turmoil, in the
! midst of this turbulent mob of wolnsh in
â  terests. whose yelps disturb the quiet of
I ihia city, stand the Populists, their ears
I besieged with prayers, pleadings, cajoles,
wrath, imprecations, promises of bribes
and threats of ruin â all this noisy conten
tion being for the purpose of loosening
their house on the platform ouiit by the
loyal men of the party at Omaha, and of
inducing them to put their shoulders to
the wheel of the party which they repudi
ated years and years ago in disgust, and
to lift it out of the quicksands of defeat
and despair.
Loyal Populists cheered when ninety
five Bturdy Populist delegates from Texas
came into the city carrying aloft the ban
ner of their faith and shouting, "No com
promise; keep in the middle of the road,
for principle and country." Magnificent
specimens of manhood are the Texans
tall, sinewy, sunburned, without an ounce
Â«f superfluous flesh, vigorous and as wiry
and as hardy as the pouies which they
ride iii t.eir own country. If they don't
like a man or a thing they blurt out their
dislike with the candor of an Indian in his
native wilds. A Texan will share wiih hia
comrade his last dollar, will divide his
coat in two to keep the cold blasts from
the shoulder of a needy friend. He fights
like an Indian, he loves like an Indian
and he hates with the intensity of a sav
age. They came here whooping from the
cars to the aristocratic Southern Hotel
into their quarters, a large parlor on the
ground floor, to the great surprise of the
slow-going St. Louisans and to the great
joy of the middle of the roadsters
who saw these strange wild men trooj..
Each man wore a white badge bear
ing as its prominent emblem a single star <
â the lone star of Texas.
Many of them wore the G. A. R. copper
button, a badge which symbolizes honor
more truly than the cross of tne Legion
of Honor, for it is a matter of history that
the Legion of Honor has been made sub
ject to barter and sale. Many of them had
also worn the gray, and fought for the lost
cause with the same enthusiasm, the same
devotion, the same self-sacrifice, the same j
conscientiousness, the game loyalty, the
same love of home as that displayed by
their brothers who wore the blue. For the
tirst time since the close of that bloody
war these two, representative of the North
and of the South, march shoulder to
shoulder, with all the old-time hatreds,
all the old animosities, all the pangs and
bitterness ot the direful past buried and
forgotten in the grave of a common cause
And above It, gladdening the eves alike of
the blue and the gray, grows the greenery
of the Populistic faith. They are men
who would fight at the drop of a hat, with
out pausing to take note of its color or
fashion. They are men of ihe "up-and-a
coming class, of the "get there rowel-deep
in blood" kind of rough riders in the race
of life. Above all they are a: true as steel.
I asked one of those long-Laired, bearded
men as to how his delegation stood on the
middle-of-the-road proposition.
"Solid as . We have come in here
with our fighting breeches on niuety-hve
strong and propose to make a rodeo of the
traitors on the floor of that convention,"
he whooped.
Then they went to the middle-of-the
road headquarters three blocks away and
signed the roll in a chirography as is
not seen on the ledger of a counting-house,
but it was a good, maniy fist that meant
what it said and needed no indorser.
So great is the crowd and so much is the
confusion that the middle-of-the-road peo
ple are not yet fully organized and don't
expect to be until late in the evening. But
they all understand that they are here as

fcT. Louis, Mo., July 21.)
The "Siamese Twin" conventions wh'rh
will meet here to-morrow in different
halls, Dut at the same hour, will have as
the ligature that bindÃ them together in a
settled purpose only the free-silver plank
of the Chicago platform. There is no at
tempt to disguise the truth that on all
other issue* the two conventions will be
hopelessly divided.
"The National Silver party," whose call
was issued January 4, 1896, stated that the
paramount issue it had to consider was
"the gold standard, gold bonds and bank
currency on the one side and the bimetal
lic standard, no bonds and Governm nt
currency Â«n the other."
On this platform a representation of
| 1318 votes was proposed for the "National
Silver Convention." Tins representation
was apportioned with a basis of one for
each Senator and Representative in Con
gress, and then additional delegates added
in accordance with the silver votes of the
several States as recorded by the Bimetal
lic Union. Not more than 300 of these
straight silver delegates are recorded as
present in the city, and scarcely more
than thÃt number are likely to be present
when Dr. J. J. Mott of North Carolina
calls the convention of silver men to order
to-morrow.
The representation of the "People's
party," or, as it is generally termed, the
"Pop-iliMt" party of the United States,
was establisheil on a niMo which should
have yielded 1358 delegates and 076 alter
nates â a total of 2034. Chairman Tau
beneck, who is not the least sanguine of
the executive officers of the People's party,
does not venture to anticipate a larger
attendance than 1000 delegates and alter
nates to-morrow.
The National Silver party is to meet in
what is known as the Music Hall. Its
course will be all plain sailing. It has
only one purpose in viewâ the indorse
ment of free coinage of silver. It will
listen with more or loss attention to long,
scholarly addresses from Pranais G. New
lands of Nevada, the Silverite Congress
man, its chosen temporary president, and
from William P. St. â¦John of New
York, ex-banker, who will be its perma
nent president. This body will in all
probability follow its programme, which
is to indorse the Chicago nominees on the
silver plank, issue an address to the
people and either adjourn in short order
or prolong its session by speeches until its
more turbulent neighbor has concluded its
proceedings.^
The People's party will assemble in the
same hall which recently echoed with the
name of McKinley as the Republican nom
inee. As to what its corrse of procedure
will be, the claims of the two factions are
to-night quite as divergent as they have
ever been; The presence of Senator Jones'
of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
National Executive Committee, and his
frequent interviews with prominent Popu
\i a iG . dale te s, .has. natural iy given . rise
to ; rumors ' that 5 a 1 "deal' " was on , which
would secure the. indorsement of Bryan
and Eewall by the convention and such a
recognition of the People's party as would
induce \ them ; to, sink for the time being
their own identity.' â¢ , \t ,
Against this theory Mr. Taubeneck,
chairman of the People's party, interposes
the strongest kind of a disclaimer, assert
ing with vehemence that the Populists
intend to nominate candidates of their
own upon a platform of their own.
There has been all day strong talk of
nominating a Southern Populist for the
second place on the ticket, even if Bryan
should secure sufficient strength to be in
dorsed for first place. But shrewd man
ipulators who are managing matters say
that "the tail goes with the hide," and
that if they carry Bryan through (of which
they huve no doubt) Sewall will follow.
The middle-of-the-road men, on the
other hand, are claiming to have carried
everything before them. They held a
meeting to-night and counted twenty
States as with them in a determination
not to indorse the Chicaeo ticket. But
their opponents assert that they counted
all the recalcitrant Bryan men as repre
senting their States, whereas the full del
egation, if polled, would have been ad
verse to them.
Both sides seem at a loss to estimate
the significance of the selection of Senator
Marion Butler of North Carolina by the
National Committee as the temporary
chairman of the convention. He has been
claimed by each faction and appears not
to have committed himself irrevocably to
either. This may possibly explain his
unanimous selection as the temporary
presiding officer of the convention.
That it will be a picturesque and curi
ously interesting gathering is already as
sured. Among those to be present are
General Weaver of lowa and Mr. Streator
of Illinois, both former candidates for the
Presidency on the Populist ticket, and
General Fields of Virginia, candidate four
years ago for the Vice-Presidency.
Eugene V. Debs of railroad strike and
injunction fame telegraphs from Indian
apolis that he will endeavor to be present
to-morrow. His lieutenant, Burns, who
shared his imprisonment, is one of the
contesting delegates from Illinois. Mrs.
Helen Goutner, Mrs. Mary Ellen Lease,
"Gen ral" Jacobs. Coxey and Carl Browne
are among the other possibilities who will
intermix with the grizzled wheat farmers
of the West, the cotton planters of the
South and the enthusiastic new converts
from the East and Middle States who will
go to make up the convention.
FOR INDEPENDENT ACTION
Reform Association Editors Come
Out Flat- Footed Against Fusion
or Indorsement.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 21.â The Reform
Press Association, composed of editors of
Populist and free-silver newspapers, met
in the headquarters of the Texas Populists
this forenoon. A committee whose mem
bers were J. M. Maliett of Texas, A. P.
Tugwell ot Washington, A. G. Brown of
Massachusetts, Frank Burkett of Missis
sippi, M. W. "\Vilkins of California and Ig
natius Donnelly of Minnesota, reported an
address which was flat-footed for inde
pendent action by the Populist conven
tion. It denounced fusion or coalition
with either of the old parties, and declared
emphatically against the indorsement of
Mr. Bryan.
The reading of the address was followed
by a stormy scene. It was put through
with a rush, however, and the Kansas
members of the association walked out of
the room in emphasis of their disap
proval.

When the National Silver Convention
meets to-morrow it will present a solid
front for Bryan and Sewall. There is no
discord, no dissensions, no entanglements.
The Silver party is a unit for indorsement.
There is really no reason why the conven
tion should be held at all. Bryan and
Sewall are the favorites of the silverites,
and their indorsement by the convention
is merely a formality. Apart from this,
the convention will recite the old story of
16 to 1 and religiously ignore all the other
great questions now absorbing the thought
of the American people. The convention
will make a strong appeal for harmony.
By its united attitude it hopes to influence
the Populists, and its conference commit
tee will make a hard fight to bring about
a recommendation by the joint committee.
Temporary Chairman Newlands is pre
paring his speech to-night. It will not be
a lengthy one, but will deal tersely with
the duties of the convention as Mr. New
lands interprets it. Mr. Newiands will
tell the convention that the surest way
for the triumph of the silver cause is to
accept the nominees of the Chicago con
vention. Permanent Chairman St. John
will deliver an elaborate speech. It will
review the history of our financial systems,
and will be such a speech that the
National Committee will have it printed
and generally distributed over the country.
The California and Nevada delegates are
taking an' active part in the affairs of the
convention. They ara working diligently
to sidetrack the anti-Bryan faction.
George W. Baker and Charles D. Lane are
especially conspicuous in the silver ranks
and are making an aggressive right for
silver. At the headquarters open house
is kept, and when a middle-of-the-road
Populist wanders in he comes out minus
the little white ribbon which distinguished
him from other delegates. Ihe Califor
nians always make a good impression at
National gatherings in the East. The del
egation has a supply of California wines
always on tap, and everybody is made
welcome. Discussing the situation here
to-day, Mr. Lane gave out this statement:
"There is not enough money in this
country. Silver is as much money as
gold is, not only made so by the constitu
tion of our fathers, bat is so intrinsically.
By tne most diabolical legislative act in'
the history of a free people and through a
most damnable and selfish conspiracy the
legislators of the country cut off half the
supply of our currency. In doing this it
doubled the purchasing power of the
favored metal, and in the same ratio de
creased the prices of all commodities. The
consequence was a general depression,
produced by the scarcity of the purchas
ing power. This thing has gone on until
the people can stand it no longer. They
have got to have relief. Talk about revolu
tion ! Of course there is a revolution going
on and no human force can stop it. The
y\. JROZELLE, Ghairman of the Missouri State populist Gommittee, a
Member of the National Gommittee, and Secretary of the
Reform J^ress Association.
PRICE FIVE CENTS,
tariff is not to be discussed. That is a
dead issue compared with the demand for
financial relief.
"When historians talk about taxation
without representation being the cause of
the American revolution, they mistake
the fact. It was the lack of money with
which to pay taxes that made the
colonists rebel against England. If Eng-
I land had piovided them with sufficient
currency we would to-day be the subjects
jof Queen Vie. Then it was British
i bayonets; now it is British gold, if any
thing, more unsparing and ruthless in its
exactions. No, I don't own a cent
in a silver mine. Ail my interests
are in gold, but that does not blind me to
the wants and needs of my less fortunate
countrymen. We are going to indorse
I Bryan and Sewali, and no power on earth
| can defeat them. McKinley hasn't got
I all the money in the country at his com
j mand. The people have some funds left
| yet. They are willing to do the right
| thing, and we must see to it that in their
j poverty they are kept free from the
temptations of the plutocrats."
Senator John P. Jones of Nevada, who
I is among the late arrivals in the conven-
I tion city, is doing some missionary work
for Bryftn and Sewall. He says that the
Populists are unreasonable and that they
should support the Democratic ticket
without any hesitation. Like the other
silver men the Senator is an enthusiast.
The Chicago convention, he said, adopted
a platform that should satisfy all the Pop
ulists and all others who are in favor of
the remonetization of silver. The road to
success is to support the Democratic nom
inee.
"I can see no other way. If we can get
together now we will achieve the greatest
; victory that was ever achieved in the his-
I tory of American politics. If we cannot
show these conditions to the men who
don't want to indorse Bryan I cannot see
any other course but to go on ourselves
and indorse Bryan. Mr. Bryan sided with
the Populists in the State of Nebraska,
and all the Populists of that State, I un-
I derr-tand, are enthusiastic for him.
I would suggest that the Bimetal*
lie convention pass a resolution
indorsing Bryan. This may have a great
influence with the Populist Convention.
If we are going to do anything we must
do it quick. We must argue with each,
man and show him that we can achieve
greater results by unifying the forces. If
each man shall make himself an agent
and do everything he can to help the great
cause along, we cannot help but succeed.
The quicker we act in unifying the forces
now at our elbows the better. We will be
sure then of not only indorsing Mr. Bryan
but will surely elect him this fall."
W. O. H. Harvey is here helping to push
the silver wave along.
"The Silver party is all right," said Mr.
I Harvey, "but the Populists are in bad
j shape. Everything is all mixed up. The
] middle-of-the-road fellows seem to be in2
the lead, and I don't know what will come
of it. The delegates from the South insist
strenuously on preserving their party or
ganization. That is making a lot of
trouble. As I understand their position,
the middle-of-the-rcad fellows are willing
to take Bryan, but they want the Vice-
President. They are offering to nominate
a Presidential candidate who shall be a
mere figurehead. Then the Presidential
-electors in the various states are to be
chosen on the basis of the respective votes
of the Democratic and Populist parties.
For instance, take Arkansas. Say the
vote there is at the rate of one Populist to
ten Democrats. The Populists would
then be allowed one elector. They would
have separate tickets, tbe same electors
being on each and each with its own State
candidates. In this way the Populist or
ganization would be preserved. The
understanding wonld be that all Populists
would desert their candidate and vote for
Bryan, but in return they would expect
the Democratic electors to vote for their
candidate for Vice-President. Here is
where the difficulty is. Governor Stone
was saying yesterday that he was sorry
now that he "had not been given the second
place on the ticket so tbat he might with
draw from the race and clear up the situa
tion."
"I am sorry, too," put in Mr. Collins,
"but as things now are the Democrats
cannot accept any such a proposition. No
one has any authority to do so."
Mr. Harvey freely admitted that ho
could not forecast now what thp outcome
would be, but as to the outlook in Novem
ber Mr. Harvey is quite sanguine.
"I do not believe," he said, "that we
will be able to carry any of the Eastern
States. To me it seems to be a waste of
energy to make any very great effort in
that section. The States south of the Po
tomac and Ohio rivers and west of the
Missississippi River, if carried by Bryan,
would give him a majority of fifteen elec
toral votes. In these sections there are
but five doubtful States. Concentrate your
energies on tnem and carry them."
"Would you let Illinois, Ohio and In
diana go?"
"No, I don't mean that. Keep up the
fight there, too, but let particular effort be
made in the five doubtful States in the
"\Ver-t and South. Now, Mr. Collins, there,
believes that we will carry New Yortc. I
cannot see it that way. I do not believe
in underestimating the opposition, and
that's why I say the East is lost to us."
"But," interrupted Mr. Collins, "while
you have been a political educator for the
last two years I have been a political
barometer. You have been in the school
room ; I have been out among the people.
I know how they feel, and I am not over
estimating our strength when I say that I
we will carry New York and some of the
other Eastern States."
"Coin" Harvey does not look to be more j
than 36 years of ape. He is tall and slen- I
der, with a rather handsome face. His j
complexion is dark, apparently tanned by !
the sun. A close-cropped mustache some
what hides the lines of Lia mouth. He
looks anything but a deep student of ab
struse economic questions, appearing
rather as a man of the world; one whom
the world might cali "a good fellow."
Colonel Carl Browne, the erstwhile lieu
tenant of General Coxey, came in yester
day and this morning met his father-in
law, the general. The meeting was not
quite as warm as St. Louis weather. It
will be remembered that when Coxey
marched on Washington his daughter, ar
rayed in the garb of ihe Goddess of Peace,
attracted great attention in the capital
city. She caugnt the furtive glances of the j
handsome Californian, and thereby hangs '
a tale. The Goddess of Peace stepped off i
her pedestal and became Mrs. Browne.
Now the dashing Carl has a beautiful wife
â with golden curls and a sparkling eye, and
General Coxey has had an empty spot
Bomewhere, from which he banished his
daughter. But like all melodramas, this
one turns out happily at last.
'â¢Every vestige of differences between
father and ourselves has disappeared and
I am so glad," said Mrs. Browne.
"The reconciliation was effected yester
day," said Mr. Browne, "and I am soon to
become managing editor of Mr. Coxey'a
paper and will return to Ohio."
Browne attracted a great deal of atten
tion about the hotel corridors to-day. He
is as handsome as ever, though his neatly
trimmed whiskers are turning gray. He
was clad in a Prince Albert suit and high
heeled cowboy boots. His hat is a large
wnite sombrero of tbe New Mexican type
and projects far over his shoulders. Browne
is from Washington. He said :
"Our delegation, of which I am chair
man, is instructed for Bryan. Aside from
tbat lam a stanch supporter of Bryan. I
think that he is the reincarnation of An
drew Jackson. He is at heart a Populist
and in sympathy with the cause of
humanity, which we advocate."
Nearly all the delegates to the two con
ventions are in town to-night.

GEORGE BAKER HONORED.
Requested to Preside Over the De
liberations of the Silver
Convention.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 2Lâ There was a
spirited meeting in the headquarters of
tne California delegation at the Southern
Hotel to-Diebt. The silver delegates from
tbe different States west of the Missis
sippi met for the purpose of considering a
plan of campaign upon which all the sil
ver forces miuht unite. There were some
150 silver delegates present. Franic Mof
ritt of Oakland sprung the name of George
W. Baker of San Francisco for temporary
chairman of the silver convention.
Mr. Baker took the floor and in a tem
perate address declined the honor. He
said that since Mr. Newlands had been
selected by the National Committee it
would be a discourtesy to him as a cham
pion of silver to be replaced by another.
Then Mr. Baker was asked to be
a candidate for the permanent chair
manship in place of St. John. He
also declined this honor, because
he thought tbat St. John, who had
been the head of a t;reat banking institu
tion and was generally known as a great
financier and friend of silver, would emi
nently fill the place.
The California silver delegation has
aroused great enthusiasm for the cauue.
The leaders are active and determined.

ST. LOUIB, Mo., July 21.â The Na
tional Committee of tbe National Silver
party met this morning at the Lindell
Hotel, but after a brief session a recess
was taken until 1 o'clock, when a secret
session was held at Dr. Mott's room at the
same hotel. George P. Keeney of Cali
fornia presided.
One of the features of the afternoon ses
sion of the committee was a speech made
Â»y Mr. Battell, the member from Ver
mont. Mr. Battell created considerble en
thusiasm when he asserted that tne farm
ers of Vermont were in open revolt agaiust

that Bryan and Sewall would carry Ver
mont, but be asserted that the Republican
majority in the State would be greatly re
duced.
Mr. Foster of Oregon, speaking to the
proposition that it was very essential that
the Silver party should continue their
organization as an independent political
body with which Republicans and Demo
crats could both consistently unite in
their support of free silver, asserted that
Bryan and Sewall would carry Oregon by
a majority o! at leasl 10,000.
This question of maintaining the silver
organization was one which occupied the
committee's attention during a greater
part of the afternoon session. It was
strongly advocated by Devine of Nebraska,
who believed -that it would attract many
independent voters who could not be in
duced to join either of the old parties, but
who place the cause of silver above all
other National issues.
All of those who :-poke strongly favored
the proposition.
George \V. Thompson of the State of
Washington was elected to a place on the
committee and following this came the
appointment of a special committee con
sisting of Senator Jones of Nevada and
Messrs. Stevens of Colorado, Baker of
California, Thompson of Washington and
Devine of Nebraska to draft an address to
the public calling upon all friends to sup
port Bryan and Sewall. There was some
discussion as to the length that the con
vention should remain in session. It is
not unlikely from the sentiments ex
pressed that the silver men may not ad
journ for three days.
At to-night's session it was decided to
appoint Congressman Towne of Minne
sota first vice-chairman of the convention.
The committee ratified at the same time
the selection of Messrs. Newlands of Ne
vada and Bt. John of New York temporary
chairman and permanent chairman re
spectively.
BUILDING PLATFORMS.
Sliver Men Stand for Free Coinage
Alone, While Populists Are
Yet Undecided.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 21.â 1t is probable
that the platform of the Silver Convention
will consist of a declaration of principles
demanding a restoration of the former
metallic moneyâ gold and silver. Unless
the present programme is changed this
declaration will be worded as follows:
Be it Retolred, That over and above all other
questions of policy we are in favor of restoring
to the people of the United States the time
honored money of the constitutionâ gold and
silverâ not ona^ but bothâ the money of Wash
ington and Hamilton and Jefferson and Mon
roe and Jackson and Lincoln, to the end tbat
the American people may receive honest pay
for an honest product; the American debtor
j Days his just obligations in an honest standard
j and not in a standard that is appreciated 100
j per cent above all the' great staples of our
j country; and to the end, further, tbat silver
j standard countries may be deprived of the
unjust advantage they now enjoy in the differ
ence in exchange between gold and silverâ an
advantage which tariff legislation alone can
not overcome.
Vie therefore confidently appeal to the peo
ple of the United States to leave in abeyance
for tbe moment ail other questions, however
important and momentous they may appear,
to sunder, if needs be, all former party ties
and affiliations ana unite in one supreme
effort to free themselves and their children
from the domination of the money powerâ a
power more destructive tban any which has
ever been fastened upon the civilized xaen of
any race or in any age. And upon the con
summation of our desires and efforts we invoke
the gracious favor of Divine Providence.
The present intention is to supplement
this by an address to the American people
1 which is now being prepared. Senator
Jones of Nevada is the guiding S p| r jt in its
construction, and it will set out in suc
cinct and terse terms the aims and desires
of those who seek the reopening of the
American mints to the coinage of silver.
At a late hour to-night it looks as if the
Populists will adopt the Chicago platform
with certain modifications intended to
make it conform more nearly to the views
of the delegates. At least that is tbe
opinion of tbe Bryan men, who claim to
be in control of the convention and in a
position to dictate tbe platform.
It is pointed out in this connection that
inasmuch as Mr. Bryan has signified bis
willingness to accept the nomination at
the bands of the Populists it would be
unwise for the friends of free silver to em
barrass him by making the platform so
radical as to offend any element of tbe
Democratic party. Believing that this
is the logical conclusion to be reached,
the Bryan men ieel that the convention
will not run the chance of losing free sil
ver by a too stubborn insistence upon
other matters, which they hold are
not at this particular time essential.
On the other hand it may be said that a
vigorous fight will be made for an inde
pendent platform and the nomination of
Bryan upon it. It remains to be deter
mined just how much of a following this
element will have.
To-night, however, men high in the
councils of the Democratic party who are
here for the purpose of watching the situ
ation and molding public sentiment, ex
press their entire satisfaction with the re
sults as they seem to have been deter
mined up to this hour, and this is con
strued to mean that a very thorough un
derstanding has been reached respecting
the lines unon which the Populist plat
form will be drawn.
The claim of the middle-of-the-road
Populists that they have developed suf
ficient strength to defeat Bryan is ridi
culed by the latter's friends. Fred Bailey
of Kansas, secretary of the Bryan steer
ing committee, says that reports received
from their sub-committee indicate that
Bryan will have at least 800 of the 1358
votes in the convention and that appear
ances now indicate his practically unani
mous nomination. Bailey is not so cer
tain of tna Vice-Presidency. The opposi
tion to Sewall among the Southern dele
gates, who are friendly to Bryan, he says,
is very strong.
The platform as outlined by Mr. Bailey
will cover the following points: Govern
ment control of railroads and telegraphs;
a fiat-looted declaration against National
banks of issue; sufficient amount of cur
rency to conduct the business of the coun
try on a cash basis ; the free coinage of
silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 ; free homes for
the Territories; a tariff plank recommend
ing a still further reduction of tariff duties
and a reamrmation of the plank in former
platforms with reference to public lands.
Neither woman suffrage nor prohibition
has been mentioned.

there should be no deiay in opening the

in the State. A resolution indorsing, with
out reservation or qualification, Bryan and
Sewall and the platform upon which they
stand was unanimously adopted.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1896.
STRAIGHT POPULISTS
ARE NOT TO BE SOLD
Continued from Firtt Page.
Populists and that there is to be no com
promise. They claim at headquarters 700
and more votes of the total of 1300 dele
gates to the convention. Among the
States which they assert are solid for them
are: Arkansas with 26 votes, Texas 95,
Georgia 61, Mississippi 18. Tennessee 53,
New York 44. Maine 9, California 39, North
Carolina 95, Missouri 38, Minnesota 56 and
a majority of the Indiana, Ohio and lowa
delegations, besides scattering votes in al
most all the remaining States.
"They can't work any unit rule in thia
convention, for the reason that you can't
gag a Populist. If there is one man in
the delegation opposed to all the rest he
is entitled to a vote and a voice in the con
vention," said a delegate this morning.
A mixed lotâ Democrats, Populists and
Republicansâ arrived from California this
morning in the roll of delegates to the
Bimetallic League to take part in the pro
ceedings of the silver convention. Among
them are: Hon. Frank J. Moffitt, a red
hot programme Democrat from Oakland;
HugoHornlein, a silver Populist, formerly
of Sacramento and now proprietor of the
Cafe Royal in San Francisco; Robert Mc-
Killican, a Democratic contractor of Oak
land ; Dr. E. H. Woolsey, formerly of the
Southern Pacific Hospital in Alameda
County; George Baker, a high officer in
the Bimetallic League of California, and
Charles R. Lane, partner of Alvinza Hay
ward in the Utica mine at Angels Camp,
Calaveras County, Cal. Mr. Lane is being
urged by Senators Jones and Stewart to
make the fight for United States Senator
from California on the proposition that he
would be a good object lesson, he being an
advocate of the free coinage of silver and
at the same time the owner of a gold mine.
He telegraphed this morning to William
Kitchener of the New York Exchange that
on to-morrow, July 22, he would have in
this city $100,000 in gold coin to wager in
any amounts that Bryan will be the next
President of the United States. Hugo
Horlein told me that the Populists of Sac
ramento County are unanimous for free
coinage and Bryan.
Alii Reed, organizer of the second dis
trict of the lowa middle-of-the-roadsters,
in charge of the headquarters here, said
to-day:
"If the enactment of a free coinage law
should be the result of the election in the
fall it would compel the creditor class of
the United States to use less than 8 per
cent of their yearly income to buy up and
corner the yearly silver product of the
world and then we would be no better off
than at present, for so long as we have a
metallic money t*>e monopolizing of our
finances will continue. We will never be
safe until we have a money as sound as the
integrity of our country, because it is based
on the integrity of our country; a money
tniit we will not bave to depend upon the
success of one class of industry â minersâ
for, but a money that will expand as our
need lor itâ our business â expands, be
cause based on our credit that expands
with our industries.
"To-day we look back on four years of
work for reform that has brought 2,000,
--000 people together in advocacy of princi
ples that, when once triumphant, will bo
a blessing to all mankind. God grant that
we may show stability of purpose suffi
cient to carry on this great work without
being carried away by the alluring of a
barren victory or the glitter of spoils, for
if we are true to our principles and labor
on with steady hands and hopeful hearts
only a few years and victory will crown
our efforts for the emancipation of hu
manity, and man will once more enjoy his
God-given right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.
"The more united the effort the sooner
the victory; but if there be those who
think they are doing more eood by leav
ing our ranks and forming a union with
others, with much regret we will hare to
let them go; bat it would be absurd to
think that we would follow them. Those
in wnora the conviction lies that the
Democrats of the Omaha platform are a
safe and sure cure for our present ills and
for whom a barren victory has no allure
ments can only fight out for thÂ«t which
they believe to berii<ht, regardless of what
the leaders may do, realizing that a union
of forces on the Weaver-Taubeneck plan,
if it were successful, would deliver a con
trolling interest of our party into the
hands of those opposed to our principles,
rob us of our organization (if we sub
mitted) ; and the victory being fruitless,
would create distrust in the minds of the
people against future efforts.
"For over a year the single-plankers
have been hot on our track trying to edu
cate the Populists out of their principles
instead of trying to educate the other fel
lows into our party. Why have they not
labored to bring the silver men to us in
stead of trying to force our party over to
them? I have no charge to make against
the honesty of purpose of any of them, but
the fact remains that the effect of trim
ming our platform would be the same,
whether secured by tbe efforts of more
power to down the goldbugs, or by the
efforts of the foreign capitalists who take
from this country $300,000,000 every year
as Americans pay for tilling American
soil and as interest on railroad and other
bonds, for the only hope of these blood
suckers lies not in who secures the trim
ming of the Omaha platform, but that the
Omaha platform be trimmed.
"But tbe greatest obstacle in the way of
success of the narrow-gaaguers is the cold
fact that the true Blue, broad-gauge Popu
list, who recognizes in this movement a
disorganization of our forces, can never
consent to be sidetracked. But with a
faith In their cause that will admit of no
faltering, they will toil on, looking for
their reward in due time in the enactment
of the just laws for which they contend;
and they will not be disappointed, for
their fight will be made with well-formed
ranks of trustworthy soldiers. There will
be a Populist ticket in tbe field in every
State in tbe Union this fall, aa well as a
National one. If we are unorganized we
will fine' ourselves at sea too late in the
day to do much in the campaign, and our
only safety lies in the formation of an or
ganization that will not only have a pow
erful influence at the convention, but will
leave us in a condition to continue the
fight regardless of what the trimmers may
accomplish, and that, too, without the
loss of any time.
"The reform movement, started at
Omaha in 1892 by a union of all the toil
ing masses, cannot and must not be aban
doned now when we are progressing so
nicely, and when it takes no flight of im
agination to see in the near future the tri
umph of our principles. But the glorious
characters who have fought so nobly in
the past, reinforced by the thousands of
recruits that are volunteering every day,
must fight on, hand in hand for home and
right, prepared to banish every foe wher
ever he be found, whether facing the front,
behind US or in our mir!<it sllnain* nn oh.
siacle to be unsurmountable, or to im
pede our progress, in the end that our pos
terity may reap the fruits of our sacrifices
as we are reaping the reward of the sacri
fices of our lathers who fought before us."
The tears came into Mr. Reed's eyes as
he uttered the concluding sentence's.
Sam P. Davis, editor of the Carson
(Nev.) Appeal arrived this morning with
the bimetallic delegation from ' Nevada
and California. He was quite 'hoarse by
reason of hurrahing for Bryan during the
whole of his trip : hither. After having
devoured two mammoth porterhouse
steaks at a cost of |3 75 and haying
washed them down with six quart steins
of beer, Bam engaged a'â  stenographer at
%5 an hour and rattled off to him at the
rate of 150 words a minute bis impressions
on the situation. After he had talked $10
worth he dismissed the stenographer,
took the shorthand notes to a young : lady
typewriter in the office of the Southern
Hotel, and, having ascertained that she
would charge only $3 an hour for type
writing, threw the notes down before her,
with" the remark: "Swim ahead; there's
your copy." â¢ â  .
"But," said the young lady, "I cannot
read those shorthand notes."
"The h , ahemâ You can't!" roared
Sam, in dismay.
Sam could not rind any one who could
read the notes, and the upshot of it all
was that he was obliged to hire a back at
an expense of $6 and run down the stenog
rapher, who was in another part of the
city, and pay him $25 for dictating nig notes
to the lady typewriter.
"It seems to be a rather roundabout and
expensive way of getting a report in
shape," remarked Sam, "but I am not
going to fall down on Ned Hamilton, if it
costs Mr. Hearst a million."
Ex-Senator Frank H. Moffitt of Oak
land loomed well to-day. Mr. Moffitt
has acquired a white duck suit and is doing
the very best he can to "stand off" the hot
weather. Mr. Moffitt called on Senator
Jones of Arkansas at the Planters' House,
and after an extended conference with the
chairman of the Democratic National Com
mittee, started out hammer and tongs to
work on the Populists.
The silver convention will beyond doubt
indorse Bryan and Senator Jones can
think of no better use to make of the
Bryan silver delegates than to put them
to work buttonholing middle-of-the-road
j Populists. Mr. Moffitt at once tackled
Thomas V. Cator, who has heretofore been
regarded as being slightly, opposed to
having anything to do with Bryan. Mr.
Moffitt says it is certain that Cator and
some of the other California delegates are
now pronounced Bryan rooters. The
Texas delegation, under the leadership of
"Cyclone" Dayh, was next sought out. A
committee consisting of Charley Lane,
the California gold miner, and Mr. Moffitt
took the Lone Star contingent in hand.
The Southerners accompanied the Cali
fornian a to the bar and relished and had
Missouri corn juice to their hearts coo
tent. Mfcrtiu told them a story or two
about Colonel Jack Hayes, the famous
Texan ranger, whose last days were spent
in Oakland, and a bond of friendship and
sympathy was soon created; but the long
bearded Populists were as immovable as
the North star. ' " '. J '
i "Talk about Charley , Hoy idea of
Texans and the delegation that visited
Congressman Tim Murphy," said Moffit.
"Why, the counterfeits are not in it with
the originals as I saw them to-day. They
listen to our stories, laugh at our jokes,;
drink our whisky and smoke our cigars,
stroke, their whiskers and then go back '
under -the; sheltering wing of 'Cyclone'
Davis, 'Tornado' .Thomas and 'Whirlwind' ,
Whipple, all â¢" of ' which are. the lovable
titles given to members of the delegation."
r Mr. Moflit said the Texans took to the |
magnificent gold badge of the California
silver delegates as a child does to a new
toy. They each wanted one, and at last
accounts Uncle Charley Lane was having
ninety-nine new badges made up especially
for the Texans at the rate of $2 a piece. |
The California badges furnish a striking
contrast with those of the cohorts of
"Cyclone" Davis, which is simply a piece
of ordinary ribbon bearing the words,
"Keep in the middle of the road." , .W â 
The Texans called on California silver
men this evening. They were well re
ceived each was given a bottle of Cali
fornia wine and they testified their appre
ciation by giving three cheers for Cali
fornia, and while the sturdy sons of the
South were in the headquarters to the
number of about fifty George W. Baker
wrote a note to Moffitt and passed it over
by the colored porter, bearing these words:
â¢â¢Moffitt, be careful what you say about
the Populists. There are as many six
shooter- in the room as there are Texans."
The Texans had an exciting caucus to
night and several hundred persons
watched the proceedings through the
plate-glass windows of their headquarter*
in the Southern Hotel. Everything went
on ordinarily at first, the delegates remain
ing in their Beats. Finally'the chairman,
who bad seemed to be uncomfortable,
stood up on the seat of his chair and be
gan to slug the atmosphere. Then the
rest jumped up on chairs and tables and
swung their arms above their heads just
as though they were poking a horse-hair
lariat over the horns of a Texas steer.
The spectators were delighted. ' They
were coing to see a genuine wild West
knock-down, drag-but and gouge scrim
mage, but when seventeen of. ninety-rive
Texans put their right hands into their hip
pockets, there was a general rush out of
range on the part of the outsiders. That
looked very frontierish and thrilling, and
when the seventeen drew forty, not navy
revolvers, but copies of the Omaha plat
form the crowd was very much disap
pointed.
All the excitement was caused by a
caucus to determine the . choice of the
delegation, for the temporary chair
manship of the delegation, and finally
Judge Jones, a straight Populist of St.
Louis, was selected.
Some of the silver delegates and whoop
ers for Bryan are a hard-looking lot of
gun-fighters, but after one or two of their
skirmishers had paid a visit on a mission
of education to the camp of the Texans
they did not send any more. The first
scout was a six-foot scrapper weighing 250
pounds and as hard as nails. When he
made his appearance in the lobby or the
Southern and began whispering for
Bryan a tall Texan with long hair and a
long white hand with graceful, tapering
fingers such as are wont to turn up the
jack and to pull a trigger of a Colt's 45
--revolver braced up against the Bryan
man.'S@yn9H
"What right have you to come cavortin'
up here around our -camp a-tryinjj to
stampede oor delegates out of the middle
of the road?" he demanded, fiercely.
"Now l you cinch' tip your bronco ~ and
gallop out of here. Git." â¢
The Bryan looked straight' in the eyes
of the Texan. Then with a little laugh
and t snort of defiance he turned . on his
heel and walked away. \ " v
" "I suppose they take us for a kinder
garten," remarked the hi* man, "and we
came here to :be educated in the Demo
cratic bible. We are straight on the trail
of Populists, arid we don't take no Demo
cratic cocktail in ours." .''â¢-'
Can. at thÂ« â¢ bQVft mil*t have taken I
something as strong later on, for they
were 'loping down Broadway red-eyed,
and mating the steers and red heifers
scatter oft the trail on both sides.
I met Carl Browne, the son-in-law o
Coxey, to-night. Carl wore his famous
hat, but the fresh and rosy complexion
which he turned to the salt sea breezes of
San Francisco had disappeared in the
steam-bath climate of the money-grab
bing East. His face was sallow, and his
hair and beard were frost-bitten. Matri
mony, instead of rejuvenating Carl, had
aged him. Otherwise he seemed to be the
same Carl, but wonderfully subdued.
They say he draws pictures as wretch
edly as ever.' As an artist I think Carl
became a remarkable case of arrested de
velopment before he began to leara to
draw.
As will be noticed in the press dis
patches in another column the National
Reform editors did what I had predicted
they would do. They passed a straight
middle-of-the-road resolution. Verily the
Populist editor hath the cunning of the
Californian coyote, which smelieth the
steel trap from afar off and which slyly
diggeth it up and eateth the salt pork set
therein for a bait. Then goeth he away
singing a tenor song unto the yellow
moon. For the Populist editor knoweth
that should the Democratic trap swallow
the Populist party there would be no
longer a need for the Populist party.

UNITED AGAINST BRYAN.
The Mlddie-of-the-Road Populists
Claim That They Will Control
the Convention.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. July 21.â The middle
of-the-road Populists are claiming to-night
tbat they will control the convention and
defeat the programme of the Bryan men
to indorse the Chicago ticket.
Mr. J. W. Cassidy of this city, who is
a delegate to the convention and who is
the moving spirit of the nriddle-01-the
road headquarters, says that the difficulty
of securing cheap transportation rates will
so reduce the number of delegates from out
lying parts of the country that the attend
ance will not exceed 1000. Of these he
says fully 700 favor the middle-of-the-road
idea, which is in opposition to fusion or to
the nomination of any person for Presi
dent or Vice-President who is not directly
identified with the Populist party.
Coxey of Ohio, the leader of the Com
monweal movement of two years ago, is
another conspicuous Populist who shares
Mr. Cassidy's confidence that Â±Jyran can
not be nominated. Ha insists that a ma
joaity of ibe people who claim to be
Populists and have been shouting for
Bryan during the past ten days are not
Populists, but Democrats who are posing
as Populists in order to create a favorable
sentiment for tne Democratic candidate.
He says the South, excepting Alabama, is
a substantial unit for a nominee who di
rectly represents Populistic principles.
His own State, he says, is also a unit for
the middle-of-the-road idea. California
and Pennsylvania entertain similar views,
which leaves to the Eastern delegates the
balance of power between the South and
the Middle West 011 one hand and the ex
treme West on the other. In Coxey's opin
ion the platform which will be presented to
the convention on Thursday will be a
practical reaffirmation of tbe Omaha
platform in 1892. The only material
change will be tbe elimination of the sub
treasury and a substitution therefor of
Coxey's non-interest bearing bond scheme
which be is hopeful will be incorporated
as one of tbe leading planks.
Texas delegates, who are making a
strong tight against indorsing William J.
Bryan, called a meeting of representa
tives from all States in accordance with
tbe plan of nominating a straight Popu
list ticket. These States were represented:
Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, lowa, Louisiana, Mis
soouri, Mississippi, Minnesota, NÂ«w York,
North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Texas, West Virginia, Washington, Wis
consin. In nearly all the Southern States
reports were made that the delegates were
solid against Bryan. Louisiana, Texas,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and North
Carolina were reported solid. In Ala
bama ail but two were against tbe in
dorsement of Bryan. Illinois and Indiana
were reported to be half Bryan and half
against.
On tbe reports that were heard it is esti
mated that ti.e middle-of-the-road people
had 100 majority in the convention. A
committee was appointed to wait on Sen
ator Butler and ask him to define his posi
tion as to Bryan. The committee reported
this evening that Senator Butler expressed
himself as being in favor of the adoption
of a platform and of tendering the Presi
dential nomination on that platform to
Mr. Bryan. If Mr. Bry an accepted he
favored the nomination of a Populist
Vice-President to be run with Bryan.
This report was received with loud ex
pressions of disapproval, and the state
ment was made that some good middle-of
the-road man should be run fo- tempo
rary chairman against Butler. This propo
sition was heartily indorsed by most of
those present, and Jerome C. Kirby, the
Populist nominee for Governor of Texas,
was suggested as a good man upon whom
a contest for temporary chairman should
be made.
A Texas delegate, however, suggested
that Texas did not desire to assume the
position of leading the fight against the
choice of the National Committee with
their man, and advising taking a man

D. Jones of Missouri was agreed upon as
the most available man for the place, and
a committee of three was appointed to
visit him and ascertain his views, but at a
late hour to-night this committee had not
reported to the meeting.
A steering committee, representing six

instructions to work with members of

principles of the People's party. While
Mr. Bryan's name was not used, it is un

It was midnight before the committee
reached the Colorado contest, which was
the last to be considered, When the case
was called the announcement was made
that|ex-Governor Waite withdrew his con

to withdraw, and asked to be heard. After
some talk it was decided to place the

BLOWS ARE EXCHANGED.
Lively Fight of Illinois Factions
While the Populist National
Committee Is in Session.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 21.â The contest
in" delegations from Illinois before the
Populist National Committee got mixed
up in the hallway outside the room in
which the committee was hearing their
respective claims this evening and blows
were exchanged. Tbe committee met at
9 r. m., and bad been in session only a few
minutes when the contestants, headed by
Burns and Hogan, made some remarks
about the Dr. Taylor faction, which Tay
lor resented. The lie was passed and in a
second the two factions were mixed up on
the floor. Dr. Taylor was thrown down
twice. He used his fists to good advan
tage and landed several blows on the faces
of his opponents. Tbe men were pulled
apart, but got toeether a second time. Dr.
Taylor was thrown and several men piled
up on top of him. There were threats of
resorting to firearms, when the police ar
rived \and restored order. Taylor tri
umphed before the committee.
The committee first assembled shortly
after noon behind closed doors, with Hon.
H. E. Taubeneck presiding. The roll call
showed the presence of nearly all the
members of the committee. Before going
into secret session Chairman Taubeneck
announced that there were a few minor
contests, and that the committee would
complete the temporary roll and select
temporary officers. For himself, he said,
be had no choice for temporary chair
man.
There are but two contests of import
ance, those from Colorado and Illinois.
The former involves the entire State dele
gation, and the latter twenty -seven dele
gates from Cook County (Chicago). The
Colorado contestants are headed by ex-
Governor Waite, but he having declared in
favor of Bryan's nomination his colleagues
deposed him tor another leader.
On the matter of temporary chairman
the two candidates were General Weaver
of lowa, who represented the Bryan-
Sewall element, and Senator Butler of
North Carolina, who is opposed to the in
dorsement of the Democratic ticket.
After the matter of the membership of
tbe committee itself had been determined
the committee proceeded to consider the
applications by a number of States for an
increased represantation in the conven
tion. In making up the table of delegates
for this convention the National Commit
tee was compelled to act upon data con
tained in various political almanacs. In
the cases of a number of States this infor
mation proved inaccurate. The commit
teemen from each Southern State demon
strated by certified copies of tabulation of
votes in their States that the Populists
were entitled to an increase in the number
of delegates of from one to five, the latter
being allowed Texas. The several Terri
tories were allowed six delegates instead
of four. Oklahoma was given the same
right of representation as Statesâ that is.
one delegate for its delegate in Congress
and one for each 2000 votes â which made
its total representation nine. Recess was
then taken.
Immediately upon reassembling this
afternoon the committee took up the
Cook County (111.) contest. After a
lengthy argument Mr. Donnelly of Minne
sota moved, in the interests of harmony,
that the two delegations be seated, each
member to have a half rote. This was
agreed toâ 49 to 18.
The announcement of the result was re
ceived with much satisfaction by the
members of the Burns-Hogan faction in
the corridor, but Dr. Taylor of Chicago
sent a message to the committee saying
he should decline to sit in the convention
with his opponents.
After deciding a case from the Nine
teenth Ohio District the committee pro
ceeded to the selection of temporary chair
man. General Weaver of lowa, who had
been spoken of as the Bryan candidate for
the place, was not mentioned. Mr. Guth
rie of North Carolina, the probable Popu
list candidate for Governor of that State,
presented the name of Senator Marion
Butler of North Carolina. Mr. Branch of
Georgia named Ignatius Donnelly of Min
nesota. A delegate from Kansas pre
! sented the name of General Field of Vir
ginia.
Senator Butler's nomination was sec
onded by "Cyclone" Davis of Texas, by a
delegate from Alabama and by F. G.
Brown of Massachusetts, and he was se
lected temporary chairman by acclama
tion, the other names being withdrawn.
For temporary secretaries the names of
W. D. Vincent of Kansas, editor of Sound
Money, and John W. Hayes, secretary of
the executive committee, Knights of Labor,
were suggested and ooth accepted.
S. D. Walton of Georgia, the only col
ored member of the committee, presented
for use at the convention a gavel com*
posed of seventeen different kinds of
wood. Sixteen of these were from the
South and West and one from the East.
The Illinois contest, which it was sup
posed had been settled so far as the Na
tional Committee was concerned, was re
opened at tne suggestion of Chairman
Taubeneck. After some vigorous talking
I it was resolved to reconsider the vote by
which the two delegations were seated,
each member having a half vote, and the
contest was set for a further hearing.
It came up at 9 o'clock this evening, and
while the committee was deliberating the
two Illinois factions, who were waiting in
the hall, passed the time by a free-for-all
fight, which bad to be quelled by the
police.
The National Committee by a vote of 30
to 26 threw out the Burns-Hogan faction
and seated the delegation headed by Dr.
Taylor. This was a victory for Chairman
Taubeneck, at whose suggestion the case
was {reopened. After the result was an
nounced and the two delegations left the
room there were several epithets passed,
but the police prevented further personal
conflict. Tne Burns-Hogan people say they
will tro before the committee on credentials
and will carry the right to the floor of the
convention.
DIRECT LEGISLATION.
A New Element Injected Into the
Programme of the "Twin
Conventions."
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 21.â A new ele
ment was injected into the programme of
the "twin conventions" to-day by the
organization of the "National Direct
Legislation League."
About sixty delegates met in pursuance
to a call issued last April. Eltweed
Pomeroy of Newark, N. J., was elected
president; Jesse White of Omaha, record
ing secretary; and J. W. Arrowsmith of
Orange, N. J., corresponding secretary.
Three sessions were held by the league to
day, the last being a mass-meeting at
which public addresses were made by ad
vocates of direct legislation. The league
proposes to establish affiliating bodies in
different States and to carry on a sys
tematic propaganda on the subject of
direct legislation.
A long list of vice-presidents was named,
including among the number Postmaster-
General William L. Wilson of West Vir
ginia. Very few of the gentlemen named
were present, but Chairman Pomeroy
stated that Postmaster-General Wilson
and other prominent men selected as vice
presidents were in sympathy with the di
rect legislation movement.
At the evening session Ignatius Don
nelly of Minnesota, Edward Evans of the
National Reform party, Paul Vandervoort
of the National Legion and others spoke.
A committee was appointed to urge the
adoption of a direct legislation plank at
the Populist convention, and another
committee was appointed to perform the
same mission at the Silver Convention.

REFORM PRESS ASSOCIATION.
Prominent Speak=rs Vigorously De
nounce the "Gone Daft" Bry
anite Policy.
The Call's Headquarters, J
Hotel Lindell, V
St. Louis. JWo., July2L>
In my brief dispatch yesterday reference
was made to the reform press association
as an element to b* reckoned at tbis stage
of the battle now in progress. At the time
I wrote no meeting of the association had
been held, but later in the day there was a
meeting of dramatic interest held. Pow
erful speeches were made by General Paul
Vandervoort of Nebraska, Ignatius Don
nelly of Minnesota, Cyclone Davis of
Texas, and other men of National leputa
tion, in defiance of the "gouedaft" Bryan
ite policy and in defense of a straight Popu
list ticket on a clear-cut up-to-date Popu- i
list platform.
In order to crystallize this sentiment, in
which there seemed to be entire unanim- i
ity. and give it due form and expression, a
committee of three was appointed to sub
mit to tbe association to-day at 10 o'clock
for consideration and adoption an ad
dress to the people. The meeting of the
association to-day was held at the head
quarters of tbe Texas delegation. The ad
dress reported by the committee was read
and a motion to adopt promptly followed.
After an animated but brief discussion, it
was almost unanimously carried.
My time has been occupied this after
noon and evening with the work of select
in c committees by the California delega
tion.
John S. Dore was elected chairman of
the delegation, Mr. Buttner secretary and
treasurer; committee of conference to
work for a union of reform forcesâ T. V.
Cator. Taylor Rogers and W. A. Vann;
committee of one on credentials, E. M.
Wardali; on order of business, Frank Mc
(iuire; on permanent organization, J. G.
Burnett; on platform and resolutions,
Joseph Asbnry Johnson.
In the course of tbe five hours' session
the sentiments of tiie delegates on party
policy became iienerally known. There
are thirty-three in attendance, seven of
whom favor some form of union with the
Bryan Democracy. Cator and Vann of
the conference are favorable to Bryan and :

DELEGATIONS DIVIDED.
Some Southern Populists Can In
dorse Bryan, but Not the Whole
Democratic Ticket.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 21.â Thomas Pat
terson of Denver, who was to-day selected
as the chairman of the Colorado delega
tion, thinks that the drift is now for both
Bryan and Sewail, and that the Demo
cratic ticket will be endorsed by the con
vention. Mr. Patterson explained to his
Colorado colleagues when they went inio
secret session, that he had now learned,
being several days on the ground, that
there were two apparently irreconcilable
elements here â those who were de
termined to nominate a straight ticket
and those who felt that the salvation of
the party depended on tbe endorsement of
Bryan and Sewall.
He detailed the various propositions
that have been suggested as a compro
mise, but expressed the belief that the
adoption of either would lead to the char.te
of jobbery, or result in the deliberate
assassination of Sewall, ana that that
cold not be tolerated.
The North Carolina Populists last night
completed their organization. They favor
nominating Goodwin, the present candi
date for Governor of Alabama, for Vice-
President. No vote on the Presidency
question has been taken by them.
Mr. George F. Gaither of Alameda says
he does not know whether or not Captain
Kolo is correctly reported in the interview
printed this morning as to his personal
desire to see Bryan nominated, but be
knows that the statement imputed to the
captain that he will or can deliver the ;
Alabama deleeation is not correct. If the
Bryan men will make M. Goodwin their
candidate for Vice-President they will
vote for Bryan, but they are not "ready 10
stomach tiie whole Democratic ticket."

middle of August, and consent to make j
one of his famous short-talk trips through
Indiana from the platform of a special j

Senator Sherman arrived this afternoon
and will have a long talk Wednesday with
.Mr. McKiniey and Mr. Hanna about the
campaign. He is of the opinion that it
should be opened at once. Senator Sher
man thinks the silver sentiment is pretty
widespread among the farmers in many
parts of the Western and Central States.
His mail, which is uncommonly volumin
ous, is chiefly composed of letters asking
for information on the money question,
and he is led to believe that the people are
thinking a great deal about it.
He thinks a very large number of speak
ers should be set to work at once, and has
xnoie faith in speakers and newspapers as
educators than iv heavy campaign litera
ture. Senator Sherman says that while
the silver craze is a good deal discussed
and has many spokesmen it can be
stamped out if a vigorous campaign of
education be waged against it.
Major McK-inley received information
this evening that tbe delegates to the Na
tional Glass- blowers' Convention, now in
session at Pittsburg, have decided to make
him a visit at Canton Saturday morning.
He will return to Canton to receive them.
NATIONALISTS SURPRISED.
Charles E. Bentley, Candidate for
President, Dampens Their
Free Coinage Ardor.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. July 21.-Charles E.
Bpntley of Lincoln, Neb., can iidate of the
j Nationalist party for President of the
United States, threw a damper on
the free coinage ardor of the
delegates to the Nationalist State
Convention here to-night in an
ddress. He passed over the free silver
plank of the party's National platform
with but a slight allusion, though the
reference was cheered to the echo, show
ing that the convention was in strong
sympathy with tne plank, and closed his
address witn an invitation to members of
the old parties who were wavering to
join the Nationalists.
"We have been called a free-silver party."
said he, "and it is true that free silver, in
one sense, is in the platform, but our great
and principal plank, and tbe one upon
which we particularly ask others to join
us, is that which declares against the
traffic in intoxicating liquors."
He paid high compliments to Bryan and
McKiniey.
The resolutions committee is in session
to-nigh:. The platform agreed upon favors
the enfranchisement of women; free coin
age of silver at 16 to 1 ; Government owner
ship of railways and telegraphs: raising
of all revenues by tixes on property and
incomes, aad a tariff only for protection ;
the protection of ail citizens in the observ
ance of any day they choose as Sunday;
teaching only the English language in the
public schools ; tbe election of President,
Vice-President and United States Senators
by direct vote of the people; stricter natur
alization lawÃ and lower salaries for public
officials. It demands the abolishment of
the convict contract labor system and de
clares against alien ownership of land.

EUROPE'S PENDING CRISIS.
Prince Bismarck Expresses Bis Views
on the Grarc Outlook.
NEW YORK. N. V.. July 21â A special
j cable dispatch to the Sun from London
; says: A dispatch from Hamburg to the
; Sun London office says that the following
|is an authorized expression of Prince I
j Jtitsmarck'-s views on the pending European !
| crisis:
"Tbe English policy is governed by â¢
j anxiety about the conflict which England
! must fight out with Russia and France.
Prance is striving for the Soudan and
1 Russia for India, and as England is their I
: common antagonist in these aspirations
they are natural allies even without a
, treaty.
"Egypt is of creat strategic importance'
to England's position both in the Soudan I
I and in India and is, therefore, now the â 
I pivot of British policy, the anxieties of j
i which have been not a little enhanced by
i Russia's recent attitude toward the
' Egyptian question.
"Enpland will not give up Egypt, but !
does not feel herself a match for Russia
, and France, and is, therefore, casting
! about for help hitherto, and let us hope in j
| tbe future, in vain, so far as Germany and '<
. Austria-Hungary are concerned.
"But the British are tormented by an
I anxiety. They now believe entirely in the
i unavailability of their European island
) empire, for whereas many things have i
changed elsewhere in the last decade, !
England's system of defense is still tbe!
sanif as in Wellington's tune.
'â¢It suffices for her non-European coun- j
tries. In view of the world-wide extent i
of her interests she must have more ships
on foreign coasts than Russia and France. '<
But the power or powers which preponder- \
a'e where the conflict must be" decided â i
that is, in the English Channel and the
North Sea â will be victorious.
"The French channel fleet alone is |
, already a match for the English, and its !
junction with the Russian Baltic fleet
would put an end to England's superiority ,
j in the waters in which the conflict must
{ be decided.
"Add to this that her insular position
I involves the danger of being starved out I
I by an enemy so that she must uncondi- ,
I tionslly surrender if a victorious hostile
i fleet should succeed in catting off her
; supplies.
"England has not ignored this danger
and is, therefore, working diligently at ;
the task of increasing her navy to such an !
| extent that it will be superior under all j
I circumstances. If she maintains her su
periority at sea her antagonists must try i
to convert the sea war as quickly as pos- I
sible into a land war and to seek a decision
where all the nerves of the world-wide em
pire meet, tnat is in London."
THE WANING GOLD RESERVE.
Action of the Setv Xor/c Banker* Is a
.Sourer of Reli-f.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 21.â Thje
treasury gold reserve at the close of busi
ness to-day stood $89,603,865. The day's
withdrawals were $164,000.
There was no information for publica
tion at the Treasury regarding the con
templated action of the New York banks
in coming to the relief of the Treasury.
Acting Secretary Curtis said he had no
"official information" to give out.
The treasury has about $8,000,000 in
United States notes and about $36,000,000
in Sherman not^s and could readily
exchange $20,000,000 of these for
sold. Both classes of notes are re
deemable in god on presentation, so that
if the New York banks exchange gold for
them and later on they desire gold, all
that is required is to present them to the
, treasury for redemption and they will get
gold xor them.
HOW MR. CAHSEGIE STANDS.
Prefer* Free Trade and Sound Money to \
Protection and Silver.
LOUIBVILLE, Kv., July 21.â Some two
months ago an interview with Carnegie !
appeared, in which he took sirong grounds â 
against free silver, saying that he would j
rather have free trade and sound money I
than protection and free silver. Captain j
George C. Norton of this city wrote Mr.
Carnegie a congratulatory letter, in which
he suggested, however, that Mr. Carnegie
ought to suggest to his party that they
shonld disapprove the wanton extrava
gance of the river and harbor bill. His !
reply has just been received and is as
follows:
Cluxt Castle, Kikgussie, V. B. >
July 4, 1806. | !
My Dear Mr. Xorton: Yours of the 23d re- :
ceived. I am glad you like my views pub- ;
lished in the Iron Age. The expenditures of
ihe United States Government as compared
With other governments are really very small, i
taking into account its wealth and population.
I do not think that there is much doing in the j
line of excessive expenditures.
The pensions ere the great charge find these
will now rapidly lessen. The amount we
spend upon harbors and rivers, in vnyopinion,
should be double, as no money expended
could do more benefit to the country. Fine
Government building.* for postoffices and
couithou>es scattered throughout the land are
really symbols of the unity of the country,
and I am always pltaÂ«ed 'o see a city get a j
postoffice or a courthouse. There is an un- j
wise economy and extravagance. Our country
is very rich, indeed, but it ha* been sndly mis
gover: Â»-d financially. The Government should j
go out of the banking business, and we should |
stand firmly upon gold. Yours very truly.

OMAHA PEOPLE
GREET BRYAN,
Rush of Crowds to Shake
the Candidate's Tired
but Glad Hand.
CHEERS FREELY GIVEN.
Men of Several Parties Join in
the Reception of the Boy
Orator.
COMPLIMENTS ARE IXCEANGED
The Nominee of the Silver Democrats
Says That McKiniey Is Even as
Great as Himself.
OMAHA, Nebb., July 21.â William J.
Bryan was given a rousing reception by
Omaha people to-night. He left Lincoln
at 6:05 o'clock over the Burlington and
reached Omaha just before 8 o'clock, after
a trip without incident. He traveled on
an accommodation train in an ordinary
coach and bought his ticket at Lincoln like
other passengers. Al the Union station
here a thousand people were assembled
and as the train came to a standstill and
the nominee stepped from the car Dlat
form the crowd let itself loose and cheered
him to the echo. With the assistance of
the reception committee and the uolice,
Mr. Bryan was escorted through the
packed masses of humanity to an open
carriage drawn by four horses, and .seated
in this beside Mayor Broach, chairman of
the reception committee, he was driven
through the streets leading to the place
whore the formal reception occurred. A
military band headed the procession and
following Mr. Bryan's carriage came sev
eral tally-ho coaches and other vehicles
crowded with young men blowing tin
horns of all sizes and of all degrees of in
harmonious ability. A great many people
were lined along the streets through
which the procession passed and these
were not backward in cheering for tbe
nominee.
The reception given Mr. Bryan at Doug
lass and Fifteenth streets, where the
speakers' stand had been erected, was full
of enthusiasm. Between 4000 and 5000
people, and this is a conservative estimate,
had gathered there awaiting the appear
ance of the Silver-Democratic nominee.
They crowded the connecting streets,
north, south, east and west, packed solidly
together, and many were framed in the
windows of the neighboring buildings.
The cheering was continuous from the
time Mr. Bryan's carriage readied the out
skirts of the assemblage until after he had
taken his eeat on the platform. Judge
Doane, a prom.vent Democrat, opened the
proceedings in a little speech complimen
tary of Mr. Bryan, in which he said:
"We uave'assembled here to-night to do
honor to our fellow-citizen, Mr. Bryan.
We have come here to show our respect,
regard and love for him, and I see oy the
large number of our Republican friends
present thnt they are not afraid to face an
'anarchist.' [Laughter.] Whatever may
be thought ot the 'mob' which nominated
him, lean assure you you need not fear
hiru." [Laughter and cheers.]
Mayor Broach, who is a Republican, fol
lowed with bÂ«of remarks introducing Mr.
Bryan. He said the meeting was non
partisan, and managed to teli some nice
thing* ot" the Democratic nominee.
Then Mr. Bryan appeared ana the cheer
ing was renewed. Hats were waived in
the air, handkerchiefs wore flitted and the
ear-splittmj: horns were tooted with all
the power of potent Kings. The platform
was erected at one corner of the cross
streets. It was decorated with flags, and
a Dig picture of the nominee hung in a
conspicuous place. The railing of the
stand was rather high, so Mr. Bryan
mounted a table, and in the conspicuous
position this gave him he made a short
speech, from which political issues were
omitted. Mr. Bryan said:
Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen: [Pro
longed cheers.] The phrase which was used
a motneut ago by a gentleman in the distance
(reierring to a cry of "Hurrah for silver"), is a
phrase that has been quite common and it tes
tifies to the interest wtiich people are feeling
in the campaign upon whicii we are now en
tering.
1 need not say to you that I am deeply
touched by thÂ» manifestations of gooa will
which have been exhibited here and else
wnere. since the nomination fell to me. I
understand that this is not altogether a per
sonal feeling, but it testifies as well to tnis
one great fact mat among the American peo
ple, without regard to party, there is a love for
American Institutions and a respect for those
who for the tim â¢ oeing stand as the represen
tatives of the <_iovernmeiit. [Cheers. J 1 appre
ciate the fact that I am a candidate before
the American v^opie for the highest honor it
is in the power of mau to bestow upon a fel
low man. [Cheers.] I am laprasaed by the
sense of the responsibility and I am supported
l>v the consciousness that if elected 1 shall
have the support of 70,000,000 of people.
[Great applause.]
This is not v partisan occasion. The Mayor
of your city is a Kepubllcan. 1 see before me
Republicans, Prohibitionibts, Populists as well
as Democrats, and I can bespeak you, my
friends, without regsrd to party, to testify that
in every contest through which i have passed I
have conceded to my opponents the seme hon
esty of purpose that I havedt-iuauded that you
should admit for yourself. [<;.-eat ebjoering.]
And so in this great and meJaocable
campaign upon whicn we are entering
any complimentary terms that you mar use
toward myselfâ l say to you that every "good
word that you can use towurd me I can repeat
of my Â»p,.oiK-nt, Major McKiniey. [Applause.]
If you tell me that I honestly redone the s n
timents written in the platform upon which I
smnd 1 tell you that I know that you who op
pose me are just as sincere in your desire lor
good government. We are not dismayed at
the use o! abuse because we know that the
great majority of Republicans and Poptriists,
as well as Democrat*, regard the use of abusive
terms as an indication that argument is feared.
[Loud cheers.]
We are going out in this campaign vicing
with each other in the enthusiasm with wbica
we support our respective views, and the cam
paign shall be determined by the sober sense
>â¢! the American people, and tliey shall regis
ter their verdict in favor of that policy which
they believe will be best for the American peo
ple. We knew not, my lriends, what that ver
dict shall be. We have our ideas, we have our
hopes, we have our desires, ai:d in our earnest
ness we express ourselves with emphasis, but
we all know this : that no matter what mÂ«y be
the result of this campaign that which is right
c.-.nnot be defeated. We know that truth, if it
is defea'.ed for the time, cannot be defeated ex
cept temporarily. We know thai there is
nothing omnipotent but truth, and we rejoice
to know, If in error, that our cause will be de
fea'.ed and that truth Â»hail come to us for our
enjoyment even it goes against >ur will. In
anything that we have advocated and in which
we have believed we ought to submit to the
American people we must abide by their de
cision until that decision can be opened up at
another election.
I thank you lur your presence on this occa
sion. I thank yon for all the great kindnesses
WBtch you have shown me in the years when
as a stranger among you I have struggled with
you by your side I thank you lor all that
cordial support that you have given me when
I have been a candidate before you. I thank
you for the kind words that you have spoken
so oiten, words more kind than I have merited,
and I come back to you bearing this nomina
tion, but assuring you that 1 am the same
person who went from you, as interested to
day aa I v.-*s then In what I believed to be the
public good. And I can assure you that no
matter what may be the result of this cam
palga I sbaJ stiU staud for vvimt I believe, let
come what will of good or ill. [Prolonged
applause.]
There i* one sense in which you can rejoice
a* this nominationâ a sense in whicri you can
rejoice at it which is not at all connected with
myself. Nebraska has been considered a far
vv extern btateâ away beyond the center of
population. It has been" considered a small
btate with a little more than a million people
within its borders. It is a new State, new
amonp the sisteruood of States, and there are
those who have thought that it would be a
g .-, t i lnc before a Presidential nomination
would be made from a man across the Missouri
Kiver. [Laughter and cheers.]
In the sense that the nomination for this
year is a compliment to the State you can ro
joice. although you may not agree' in the polit
ical opinions of the nuu who presents the
nominatiou to you. I attended the St. Louis
convention, and as a Nebraska citizen I was
proud of the distinguished ability wi:h which
the junior Seuator trom this State presided as
the permanent chairman of that convention
[Applause.] He reflected honor upon the peo
ple of Nebraska, and as 1 shared iv the pride
which Republicans fen at the honor of their
chieftain and at the ability which he
manifested in that convention, so I can un
derstand how Republicans In Nebraska, al
though they may oppose everything I believe
in, may rejoice in the honor, perhaps not by
deslgn, that nas come to a citizen of your
Stale. I can also understand how some of you
young men who â  appear before me may
well be proud that so distinguished an honor
has fallen upou one of the young men. [Cries
of "That's right !" and great cheering.] With
nothing: but zeal for a cause to commend me
I have at least demonstrated tnat age is not a
necessity in politics in the United States.
[Great cheering.] I say that young men may
feel a pride tb:it a young man has been nom
inated, although they may go to the polls and
In the exercise of their sovereign rights may
cast their votes against me.
My fri-nds, for all that you have done, fpr
all that you have said, for all that you have
felt, 1 beg to thank you and assure you that
whatever ma-y come it shall be my desire and
I shall prize it to know that I have obtained
your nspect, your confidence and your est'.'ein ;
and it shall be the saddest day of my life if
any word or act of mine shall make any person
in this vast throng regrei a single kind
thought that he has felt toward me. I thank
you for your attention.
At the conclusion of the speech , Mr.
Bryan stepped down from his lofty perch,
but almost immediately came forward
again and told the assemblage that his
arm , was pretty tired, but he would be
glad to shake hands with his friends as
long as it held out. hundred peo
ple tooK advantage of the "invitation, and
for an hour and a halt the nominee went
through the trying ordeal. This reception
was conveyed to the Paxton Hotel, where
he spent the night. â¢ ,
To-morrow afternoon Mr. Bryan will go
to Council Bluffs, lowa, across the river
from Omaha, and after making an address
there will return to Lincoln.

WASHINGTON, D. C, July 21.-Secre
tary of the Interior Hoke Smith took him
self out of the doubtful column this after- '
noon. His paper, the Atlanta Journal, j
comes out in an editorial pledging itself !
to support the Bryan and Sewall ticket.
It is plain that Mr. Smith lacks the cour
age to bolt, and with his support of the
regular ticket Georgia, the leading busi

stricken from the list of Southern States j
that would give any support to a third i

Secretary of State Olney has left the city
without confiding to any one the goal of '

that he has gone to see the President and
to discuss with him the Venezuelan affair
and incidentally to talk over the daily
dwindling prospect for a successful
launching of the third ticket.

Postmaster-General Wilson still remains
silent.
The critical illness of Justice Field of
the Supreme Court makes a vaoancv on.
the bench one of tue possibilities of the
near future. Justice Field soughi all his
life to outlive the contingency that Mr.
Cleveland might appoint his successor,
but it appears that fate will defeat him,
at last. It is believed that the appoint
ment will go to Mr. Wilson or Mr. Car
lisle. Hence it is not to be expected
of these two gentlemen that he will be
particularly vociferous in voicing his atti
tude to the Democratic ticket. They are
between two nres. After tbe appointment
by the sound money Presidentcomes con
firmation by the free silver Senate. If
either gentleman comes out for Bryan and
Sewall too pointedly he will offend the
President and fail to get the appointment.
If, on the other hand, he bolts the ticket,
he will offend the Senate and will thns
fail to be confirmed.
'â¢For," said a very prominent Demo
cratic Senator this "afternoon, "we will
loot upon every member of the Cabinet
who is not with us as against us, and we
will certainly refuse to confirm any one of
them whom Mr. Cleveland appoints to the

''Logically, consistently and honestly,
if they believe in silver and not gold, the
great majority of Republicans in Montana
will support Bryan and Sewall. They can
pursue no other course. Montana Repub

man was one of tbe silver Republicans

SWEPT TO DEATH
WHILE SLEEPING.
Two Houses and All of the
Occupants Washed
Away.
TEN PERSONS PERISH.
Terrible Havoc From a Cloud
burst in Franklin County,
Kentucky.
WIDESPREAD RUIN REPORTED
Railroad Tracks, Bridges and Entire
Fields of Grain Carried Off by
the Torrent.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., July 21.â Ten lives
were lost and great havoc wrought to
property by a cloudburst last night and
early this morning which seems to have
vented its fury on Benson CreeK in Frank
lin County, where two houses were washed
away and every one of their occupants
drowned. The dead are:
James Bradley and two children; bodies
recovered.
Mrs. George Bryant and two children;
bodies recovered.
Unknown man; body recovered.
Mrs. James Bradley and two children;
bodies not recovered.
While the rainfall within an area of 100
miles ranged from 2.5 to 7.15 inches, no
further loss of life is reported, though
bridges are down and communication
from the county seal to the outiyine por
tions is cut off.
Mrs. Bryant kept a tollgate near the
bridge. The little tollhouse was right on
Benson Creek, just across from James
Bradley's and not far from her father's,
Squire Moore. The Con way mill, just
above, was the first to go. Its timbers
must have swept away the Bryant and
Bradley houses. These houses themselves
must have hit the railroad bridge tv;o
miles below, as no mill timbers are seen
below. The bridge was swept away with
terrible force. Everything about it, iron
and all, except the main abutments, is
gone.
In ten minutes after the cloudburst Ben
son Creek, which empties into the Ken
tucky River immediately below the town,
was a mad, swollen river, covering the val
ley on either side and sweeping everything
before it. Ail trains are laid up until re
pairs can be made. Passengers are being
transferred around the break in waeons.
The biggest property damage was prob
ably at Pence's sawmills. The supply of
logs was tied up in great rafts on the river
just below where Benson Creek empties.
Every log, representing more than 25,000
feet of lumber, was swept away. The iron
rails for fifty feet back of the abuttment of
the Louisville and Nashville bridge were
twisted in two and dragged down the
stream with the bridge.
Dispatches from all parts of the east
central portion of the State report great
loss. Bridges on the Louisville and Nash
ville Railroad east of here were washed
out and traffic is at a standstill. Farmers
in this section suffered heavy loss, entire
fields of wheat and corn being swept away-
The loss to lumbermen alone the Ken
tucky River will be enormous, saveral
mills and thousands of logs having been
swept away.
At Shelbyville Clear Creek overflowed
the lower portions of tne town and pat
out the fires in the gas works. At Hard
insburg the water stood five feet deep in
the Baptist and Methodist churches. At
Louisville over five inches of rain has
fallen during the past twenty-four hours,

FARMERS MADE SAPPY.
Good Crop* Reported in Nearly Every
Section of the Country.
CHICAGO, 111., July 21.â The week has
been favorable for growing crops in the
principal agricultural States. Too much
rain, however, caused damage to grain in
shock in the Ohio Valley and Tennessee.
Corn has made excellent progress during
the week, and the outlook for this crop in
the great corn States continues most
promising. The crop is decidedly in ad
vance of tne season, and the early planted
in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois is near
ing maturity. In South Dakota and ex
treme Western Nebraska corn is in need
of rain. Spring wheat has experienced
favorable weather conditions in Minne
sota and is reported as somewhat im-
Droved in North Dakota, but has been
injured to some extent in South Dakota
by rust and dry, hot weather.
Tuere has been too much rain for cotton
in Georgia. Florida and South Carolina.
Cotton is suffering from drought in Ar
kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. In
Texas the week has been very favorable
and the cotton has, as a result of recent
rains, taken new growth and i 3 doing
well. The general outlook for tobacco
continues promising.
South Dakotaâ Showers few and scat
tered. In many localities wheat, oats and
potatoes were more or less injured by high
temperature. Corn did well generally and
is tasseling and earing, but needs rain,
Some wheat and oats harvested.
Kansas â Hot and dry for two days,
cooler and moist afterward, with abundant
rains except in extreme western counties.
Conditions unusually favorable to all
growing crops and they are in prime con
dition. Early corn is in roasting ear in
northern portion, with late corn following
raoidly.
Nebraskaâ Small grain harvest well ad
vanced and thresning commenced. Win
ter wheat yielding weli, but oats light in
quantity and poor in quality. Corn nas
grown well and continues in excellent con
dition, except in extreme western coun
ties, where it suffers tome injury from
drought. The ground is beginning to get
dry and rain would be beneficial in most
sections of the State.
lowa â Copious raius, fairly well dis
tributed over central and southern dis
tricts, greatly helped corn, potatoes, grass
and garden truck. Harvests cf hay and
small grains about completed and early
threshing reports indicate very light yield
and weight of oats with wheat add barley
somewhat below the average.

Arrival in Ittis Country.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 21.â The Ro
man Catholics of the country are await
ine with lively interest the arrival of
Monsignor Diomede Falconio. papal dele
gate to the United States, who is to suc
ceed Cardinal Satolli as the Pope's repre
sentative in this country. He is booked
to leave this week.
Monsignor Falconio was born about

opinion that Monsignor Falconio will
prove quite acceptable, because of bis long
residence in America, and also on account
of his thorough knowledge of American

TRAGEDY ON THE OCEAN,
The Herbert Fuller's Captain,
His Wife and Second Mate Â»
Are Murdered.
Mysterious Conduct of the Drunken
Crew, Who Are All Thrown
Into Prison.
HALIFAX, N. 8., July 21.-Quite a sen
sation was caused here to-day by the ar
rival of the American ship Herbert Fuller.
She sailed from Boston a few days ago,
bound for Rosario. As soon as the vessel
came into tbe harbor it was seen that
something was wrong on board. Tbe
proper sails were not set and the crew
acted very strangely. News soon reached
the from the ship that the bodies of
three murdered people were on board.
The proper officials were notified and an
investigation promptly made. Tbe offi
cers of the law were horrified to find that
the murdered persons were Captain Nash,
his wife and Second Mats Brunberg.
No one aboard would give any informa
tion as to how the murders occurred or
who was responsible for them. The only
thing they could find out definitely was
that the killing took place on Juiy 13. At
that time there were seven men on the
ship, besides a passenger named Monck.
None ot the men would talk. It is be
lieved that an outbreak took place among
the men and that Second Mate Brunberg
attempted to stop it. The sailors resented
his interference and killed him. Captain
Nash took a hand in the mate's behalf
and was also killed in the presence of his
wife, who was afterward murdered in or
der that she might tell 1.0 tales. There
was plenty of liquor on board, and it is
believed the crew had been drunk for sev
eral days.
Jt is hoped that more light will be
thrown on the traeedy in a few days, when
the men get sober enougn to appreciate
the awful position they are in. It is prob
able that the bloody wort may have been
done by some one or two men, while the
others are shielding them.
Ail of the people on the vessel were
promptly thrown into prison. It is ex
pected that some of them will tell the de
tails of the killing before many days have
passed. _____^____^___
INSANE FATHER'S DEED,
Cuts the Throats of His Three
Children While They
Lie Asleep.
He Then Set Fire to His Dwelling
and Shoots Himself Through
the Heart.
ATTICA, Mich., July 11.â The most hor
rible tragedy ever enacted in this part of
the State of Michiga n took place near this
town this morning, when a crazy man
killed three of his children and then took
his own life.
About 3 o'clock thin morning the dis
covery was made that the house of Gor
man Swain, a farmer living not far from
the outskirts of town, was on fire. Neigh
bors were soon on the scene, and did what
they could to save the house.
When the flames were sufficiently sub
dued to allow an investigation a horrible
discovery was made. It was found that
the fire was the last act of a dreadful trag
edy.
The first thine the searchers discovered
was the body of Swain lying on the floor.
In thÂ» hand' was still grasped a revolver,
while a bullet hole iv tne breast directly
over the heart showed the manner of the
man's death. Powder stains on the cloth
ing left no doubt that death was the result
of suicide.
Farther on were found the bodies of
Swain's youngest three children, all dead,
with their throats cut from ear to ear. A
butcher-knife, all stained with blood, lay
near the bodies of the little victims.
There can be no doubt that Swam killed
his children and then shot himself. He
had been acting queeriy for some time
and was undoubtedly insane at the time
be committed the deed. It is evident
from the indications in the house that he
arose early this morning and butchered
the children while they lay asleep. He
cut their throats with the butcher-knife
and then, when sure of their death, set
fire to the house and shot himself through
the heart.
The dead children are: Frank, aged 11;
Lucy, aged 9, aud Jimmie, aged 7. Three
older children had gone to a neighbor's
house, where they were staying all night,
and it is to this that they owe their lives.
JAMAICA'S RAILROAD DISASIER.
Seventeen Persons Killed, and , Twenty.
Two Injured, Ten Fatally. â 
BALTIMORE, Me, July 2Lâ The
steamer 'America, from Jamaica ports,
brings details of the accident on the new
Jamaican ;. railroad, recently., reported in
these dispatches, and -in which seventeen
persons lost their lives and twenty-two
were severely injured. It occurred July 11
near Annato Bay.. A locomotive drawing
six flatcars 1 loaded with colored laborers,
male and female, was I descending a step

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1896.
COOLIES WORK IN
BIGGS' CANNERY,
White Men in Want While
Asiatics Are Offered
Employment.
PROTEST OF CITIZENS
Gave a Subsidy for the Plant
to Provide for Local
Laborers.
THEIR CHAKITY GOES ASTRAY.
Managers of tbe New Concern Give
Situations to Mongols and
Japanese.
BIGGB, Cal., July 21.-The people of
this town, in the heart of the fruit coun
try of Northern California, have a griev
ance. After raising a fund to provide
labor for the unemployed of the district,
they find that the beneficiaries of their
generosity are Chinese and Japanese
coolies and white laborers from other sec
tions of the State. To secure a fruit can
nery here they gave a liberal subsidy, and
now that the managers of the plant ignore
the unemployed men of Butte County,
the subscribers to the fund feel justified in
complaining.
Early last spring a project was started
to provide employment to the idle in this
vicinity. So enthusiastic were the citizens
that they subscribed $5000 toward the erec
tion of a cannery. With this substantial
aid Hackmott & Nelson carried out the
project and in due time one of the most
complete canneries in the State was
erected.
When the fruit season was at its prime
the cannery managers advertised in all
the county papers for help. In conse
quence, many men with their families
moved to Biggs, hoping to get work.
Some were employed, but the greater
number could not secure positions. This
did not create much ill feeling, but when
the managers contracted with a Chinese
company for cheap labor, and Chinamen
and Japs were engaged to do the cooking
and soldering in the warehouse, a storm
of indignation was aroused. Those who
subscribed toward tne erection of the
plant declare they will not live up to their
agreement. It is claimed also, that out
siders are given employment in preference
to the Biggs people.
Two white men are on hand for even*
position in the cannery, this being the re
sult of advertising that 500 people were
wantel, when, as a matter of fact, tbe
cannery has been overcrowded with ap
plicants constantly.
PACIFIC GROVE CONCERT

Against the Attacks of Colonel
Ingersoll.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., July 21.â This
was the last day of Chautauquan As
sembly. All classes met at 9 o'clock and
remained in session late so they might
finish up their several studies. The class
in singing will not close until Friday or
Saturday.
The forum hour was consumed by a dis
cussion of silver. - Edward Berwick was
chairman. All Chautauqua members gave
their views on the subject.
This afternoon Selah W. Brown deliv
ered a lecture on "Honor-Bright Bob," re
ferring to Colone 1 Robert G. Ingersoll as
the greatest living infidel. He began with
an account of ingersoll's early life in Illi
nois; then taking up his lectures he
quoted from them and answered bis objec
tions to the Bible. Mr. Brown then spoke
of the character of Ingersoll's audiences,
and contrasted infidelity with Christianity.
He spoke of the wonderful progress which
Christianity has made and backed bis
statements with statistics. He enlarged
particularly on In^ersoll's lecture, 'The
Mistakes of Moses." The speaker met the
objection that there was mystery in Chris
tianity by proving that there was mystery
in everything. He gave a history of in
fidelity in France, pictured a number of
deathbed scenes, and closed with a glow
ing eulogy on the Bible.
The Knickerbocker Male Quartet, Miss
Gruenhapen and all the assembly talent,

WERE MARRIED BY TELEPHONE.
James Lawler and Miss Ollie Ray, whose likenesses are here reproduced, are the
young people who, standing in the Sunset Telephone office in Tulareon Sunday, were
made man and wife by Rev. K. H. Bateman, who was at Santa Cruz, 250 miles away.
Ihe voices of the principals in this romantic ceremony could be recognized through
the 'phone, and Pastor Bateman declare* the knot was firmly tied. Mr. and Mrs.
Lawler were launched upon the sea of matrimony in a manner so charming in its
novelty that "telephone marriages" are expected to become a fad in Tuiare.
SANTA BARBARA NOVELTY,
Red, White and Blue Larkspurs
Grown Upon a Single
Plant.
Florist Tebbetts Will Send to McKin
ley a Bouquet of the National
Colors.
BANT A BARBARA, Cal., July 21.â
La-t year The Call made note of a very
interesting and unique development in
floriculture in Santa Barbara made by
George P. Tebbetts, an old-time journal
ist, who planted the seeds of the pink,
white and blue larkspur in b.13 own gar
den, and was later surprised to find several
plants, each one bearing the National
colora distinctly dehned and separated.
Mr. Tebbetts carefully garnered the seea
and this year planted it, hoping to estab
lish a new and patriotic species of delphi
nium. The result has been something of
a disappointment in that the colors, in
stead of keeping clearly dehned, have
insisted upon more closely combining.
They do not exactly form stripes and
â tan, but the red, the blue and tbe white
form bars and specks and body color upon
the same blossoms. Tbe experimenter
will persevere in li is effort, and hopes by
the time McKinley is inaugurated to send
him a bouquet which will represent in one
graceful flower, as never before, the Na
tional colors of the land over which he
will preside.
GARDENS SUFFER A DROUGHT.
Santa Barbara Still Struggling With the
Water Question. â 
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July 21.â At
a meeting of the City Council this after
noon the city, engineer revised the estimate
for a street-sprinkling and water supply
system to read as follows: Cost of pipe
system for the city, $29,1.00; cost of tunnel,
pipe line : and reservoir. $20,000; cost of
pumping plant for sea water, $900. ' .
"The water question is the great con
sideration of the hour here. -Notwith
standing the copious rains of last winter,
the city supply is running so short that it
has been necessary to discontinue sprink
ling the streets, and citizens cannot obtain
enough water to sprinkle their, gardens.
As flowing water has been developed in
tunnels in Cold Spring Canyon, it seems
desirable to convey the flow to tne city as
soon a* possible. Meantime the great Pa
cific laves the city's feet, an unlimited
reservoir from which to draw to lay the
dust on the streets. People ara beginning
to believe that it is about time to draw
upon this great natural advantage, and
there are even some wags who assert that
if the Pacific were on the other side of the
Santa Ynez range San ta Barbara would
long ago have set out to tunnel the moun
tains to bring it hither.
SANTA BARBARA'S HIGH SCHOOL.
Iom!/iÂ» to Be Educated in the Old San
Marco Hoiel liutlding.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July 2Lâ
The School Trustees of this city nave ne
gotiated a lease of the San Marcos Hotel,
hitherto under lease to Walter J. Ray
mond. The old hotelry will henceforth
be used to accommodate the high school,
which is in a vigorous condition with a
membership of 180 punils, The high
school has hitherto had, crowded quarters
in an unsavory location in the old Third
Ward school building.
The San Marcos was built in 1872 for the
Santa Barbara college, an institution well
organized and manned, but which was de
cidedly in advance of the educational re
quirements of this town twenty-four years
ago and which soon collapsed for lack of
support. It is now the property of the
Hollister estate. The building has beauti
ful and extensive grounds and will be in
all respects a fine home for the advanced
pupils of the public schools.
ECONOMY IN THE ASYLUM.
Dr. Clark Says Expense Bills Are Xot
l'niirrei*artly Large.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 21.â Dr. Clark
was seen by a Call correspondent to-day
with, reference to bis having been called
before the State Board of Examiners yes
terday by Governor Jtfudd and questioned
regarding the increased expense of main
taining the Stockton Asylum.
"There is no doubt," said he, "that the
payroll has increased considerably, but
my policy has been to look at the general
results in the line of economy and not to
make any particular branch look as though
it cost less than formerly. The general
saving for the whole institution here has
been very great this year and we are many
thousands oi dollars below the estimates
made for the asylum.
"I will explain why the payroll is larger
than it was. I have about finished the
work on the farm. We have here alto
getner about 100 acres of land and now
some eighty acres are under cultivation.
All the work is done by the patient?, and
often as many as 100 at a time are sent out
to work in the held or garden. It takes
more attendants to care for them outside
than it would to herd the men inside the
asylum yard and wards.
"The employment of patients in making
these swimming tanks and in tilling the
fields not only aids the econom.cal run
ning of tne asylnm, but is a benefit to
them mentally and physically. It gives
t .em beaithy exercise and enables patients
to take their minds from their troubles,
thus helping to cure many of them."
Attempted Suicide at Merced.
MERCED, Cal., July 21.â William Tee
pies, a young man 2Â» years of age, recently
employed as a waiter, attempted suicide
thi- attertioon, because ne was out of em
ployment. He shot three times at himself,
one bullet takinp enect near the heart,
another in the leg and the lust one missing
him entirely. The wounded roan was ru
mored to the hospital, where he is resting
easily. *
ACCUSE FRESNO'S SHERIFF
Experts Declare He Has Drawn
Money to Which He Was
Not Entitled.
Supervisors Order the District At
torney to Bring Suit for Its
Recovery.
FRESNO, Cal., July 21.â Two experts
appointed by the Board of Supervisors to
examine the books of the Sheriff's office
rendered a report to-day, in which they
state that Sheriff Scott has been paid
$2581 03 in excess of what he should have
been paid for boarding prisoners. The
experts state that they found the jail reg
ister in a deplorable condition. There
were numerous mistakes and double reg
istrations of prisoners, which could only
be corrected by referring to the records of
the various courts. The report gives a
long tabulated statement, purporting to
show that during forty-one months, end
ing May 30. 1896, Sheriff Scott received
$2581 03 more than he was entitled to for
the maintenance of prisoners.
The Supervisors received the report,
placed it on rile and passed a motion in
structing the District Attorney to proceed
immediately to collect overcharges from
the Sheriff.
By his friends, Sheriff Scott is not
deemed guilty of willfully delrauding the
county. He bad been feeding the pris
oners who worked on the chaingang three
meals a day, and in this manner doubled
On the "number of breakfasts." He did
this, it is claimed, with the full knowledge
of the Board of Supervisors, and it al
lowed his bills. Since then, however, ill
feeling of a political nature has arisen
between the Sheriff and the Supervisors,
and the latter now ciaim that they never
passed an order allowing the Sheriff to
feed the prisoners three meals a day.
FIREBUGS FRIGHTENED AWAY.
An Attempt to Destroy the Magnificent
Barton Opera- Bouse.
FRESNO, Cal., July 21.â Firebugs last
night attempted to set fire to tbe Barton
Opera-house in this city. When Janitor
Hall made his rounds this morning he
found that the firehose had been cut and
the water turned off in the pipe. This
aroused bis suspicions, and making a tour
of investigation he discovered an odor of
kerosene in the basement under the stage.
There was no evidence of fire, however,
the miscreants having evidently been
frightened away.
The opera-house is one of the finest in
the State, and had a blaze gained any
headway the loss would have ben great.
It is situated in tbe business portion of the
city. No motive for the deed can be
ascribed, nor is there any clew to the cul
prits.
MAR I N JAILBIRDS FOILED.
Convicts at San Rafael Detected While

SAN KAFAEL, ; Cal., July 21.â Some
San Quentin expert work was done in the
Marin County jail to-day. A score or
more of Warden Hale's boarders are here,
having come to prove the innocence of
Robert Kelley, who murdered Convict
Arrison in prison last May. These prison
ers " testify and are taken from the court
to the jail down stairs. Four or five of
them were in a cell together this forenoon,
when a noise attracted attention, and an
examination revealed that they had sev
ered one window bar and very nearly cut
another. In a few minutes the whole
party would have been out. It is sup
posed that they bad secured some broken
saws. The work was done with remarka

MISTAKEN ZEAL OF LEADERS.
A Democratic Leader Who Believes
That Right Is Above Blind
Allegiance.
EUREKA, Cal., July 21.â The Daily
Humboldt Standard, the leading Demo
cratic newspaper of this county, in reply
to an article in this morning's Times, a
Republican paper, claiming that tbe
Standard's attitude as regards the Chicago
platform is inconsistent, has the following
to say on the silver question :
"The Standard has not advocated free
coinage of 50-cent dollars and while the
present editor controls the paper it will
not do so. As far as the Democratic party
is concerned we have little left of it in
this section. It has gone over to the Pop
ulists. Right is above party allegiance
and though 1000 men in their mistaken
zeal should stand up and swear that it is
right and just and honest to make debased
coinage and declare it legal tender we
could not believe it."
OREGON BIMETALLISTS.
Leaders Favor an Indorsement of Bryan
at St. Louis. .
PORTLAND, Ok., July 21.â Adherents
and supporters of the new political power
in this State, the Bimetallic League, which
held its convention on July 9 at McMinn
ville, look with trepidation upon the pos
sible split of the Populists at St. Loijis.
The hope of the bimetallists is to unite,
if possible, all the differing Populistic fac
tions on the money question, and all the
influence possible will be exerted to that
end to oppose the single gold-standard
nominee of the Republican party. There
fore there are anxious eyes turned toward
St. Louis. The leaders of the Bimetallic
League of Oregon are working with might
and main for ibe spread of the doctrines
of the bimetallism, and the disconnected
and discontented are asked to try the new
I remedy 3nd to sever connections with the
' gold bugs. President Essies ton of the
Bimetallic League in Ashland, one of the
strongholds of the party and which sent a
large delegation to St. Louis to boom the
double-standard's advantages, has issued
1 an address, in which he says:
It is expected a union will be effected so
that Populists, silver Democrats and silver Re
publicans will have but one electoral ticket in
the field in- Oregon. This will mean victory
for us in this State by a majority of at least
20,000 in the Presidential election over the
slngle-gold-atandard: nominee of the Republi
can parly. By union the silver men will elect
the next President; by division they will do
precisely what the gold men desire and will
place a gold man in the White House for an
other four years. . . â¢ . â¢

â  .;' â '..â ' Evade Â«â¢ Judgment.
ALBANY, Ob., July 21.â The little town
of Waterloo is in a peculiar predicament.
As the result of a lawsuit it is without
municipal government whatever. Re
cently Joseph Misner was visited by Rev.
Mr. McVicar. The latter's child became
ill with" measles, and because. Mr. Misner
did not put out a flag to warn people
against contagion he was arrested and
fined $15 and costs. He appealed the case
to the Circuit Court and won his suit.
The costs, amounting to $53, were recov
ered from the town.
The town officers did not take this de
cision kindly, but what was worse there
was no money in the treasury to Day the
judgment. â¢ So Mayor Turpin, Recorder
Stiers, Marshal Devine and the whole
Council resigned, leaving the town with
out anybody to look after municipal busi
ness. , " - .

Long List of Entries for- thm Agricultural
Society Meeting.
PETALUMA, Cal., July 21.â There is
probably no town in California that feels
the "hard timed" less than Petaluma, and
when the directors of the Sonoma and
Marin Agricultural Society expressed a
doubt as to the possibility of holding a
fair and race meet this year the business
men at once bestirred themselves and sub
scribed so generously that the coming fair
is certain to be a most successful one. The
scene at the fair grounds is already a
lively one. There are now 200 runners
and trotters a& the park, and more are ar
riving daily, while the many trainers,
stable-boys and other attendants make the
place a busy little town in itself.
The meeting will begin on August 3,
and the entry lists are already lengthy.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 21.-The
Democratic Convention of the Second
Congressional District was held in the
Capitol building this afternoon, it being
an adjourned meeting from the 16rb of
June. Only about one-fifth of the dele
gates were present, and but few of the ab
sentees were represented by proxies. The
Congressional nomination was a gift for
Marion de Vries, the young attorney of
Stockton, who was named without oppo
sition. .
The convention was called to order by
Dr. H. L. Nichols of Sacramento, and the
majorities of the respective delegations
were empowered to ca^t the vote of the
absentees. In his < peninâ¢ speech the
chairman, after outlining the duties of the
convention, reviewed the action of the
Chicago gathering.
Frank H. Gould then presented the
name of Colonel Marion de Vries of San
Joaquin County as the nominee for Con
gress from Uie Second District. Gould, in
his nomination speech, said this was a
young man's year in politics. De Vries
was only 34 years of age, was born in Cali
fornia, was educated here and had occu
pied official positions in San Joaquin
County, where he never did an official act
which was criticized. Gould promised
that De Yries would canvass the district
as it had never been canvassed before, and
work for the interests of the Democratic
party generally, as well as his own inter
ests as that party's nominee.
The nomination was seconded by GiUis
Doty and William M. Gibson, and then
General Joe Hamilton, the "old war
horse" of Placer, iv behalf of the old
guard Democrats, thanked the convention
tor its choice, and indorsed De Vrie's nom
ination, which was made unanimous.
De V ries was called to the platform. In
accenting the nomination he said:
' SVnatever the outcome ot this cam
paicn may be, it will ever be a great pleas
ure to me in after life to be aole to say
that in this convention of Second Con
gressional District Democrats my name
was pronounced by that sturdy Democrat,
General Joe Hamilton.
"I have always fell that my personality
lay wholly in my profession, ana that any |
interruption of ray practice, even for a
lew months, would be a sad thing to me.
But when I look over tbe condition of af
fairs in the representation of this district,
wiien I Jearned tnat no man could be
found who was wiliitig to lake up the in
terests of my party against of that of the
incumbent, 1 felt my duty was to accept
the honor you tender me.
'1 ieel that one who represents free sil
ver and who is opposed to the lunding
bill should be sent to Congress from this
district. When you are a3ked where your
nominee stands say that 1 am for free sil
ver at 16 to 1, and that I am unalterably
opposed to any scheme by which railroad
interests are furthered or subserved. I
was educated by Marion Biggs, my politi
cal father, to beiieve in righting for the
ticket, ana from to-day on 1 will fight to
the last to attain success."
The following Congressional committee
was selected: Amador, Silas Penry;
Butte, J. D. Sproulc; Caiaveras, Will A.
Dower; Inyo, J. H- Muiholland; PJacer,
Joe \V. Hammond; Sacramento, GiUis
Doty; San Joaquin, Frank G. Nichols:
Sutter. S. D. Hicks; Tuolume, S. D. ilo
ran; Yuba. C. S. Brook.
The committee was empowered to fill
whatever vacancy occurred in the commit
tee, and to fill any vacancy that may
occur in the nomination for Congress.
Giilis Doty arose and spoke of the death
of F. T. Van Fleet, who was a delegate
and who succumbed several days ago to
injuries received in a fall while sleep
walking. A committee of three was ap
pointed to prepare resolutions of respect,
and the secretary was instructed to spread
sucn resolutions on the minutes of the
district convention when they should be
presented to him.

SAN BERNARDINO, Cal.. July 21.â
Sheriff Holcomo returned to-day from the
Randsburg mining district, and reports a
boom. The population of the district is
about 200, and there is not an idle man in
that region. Strides are made almost daily.
Some of them are very rich. The great
drawback is lack of water, which sells at
$2 per barrel. Two stamp mills are run
ning from one ledge; 43% tons netted
$2700. while a fifty ton lot from another
mine brought $2500. Sheriff Holcomb re
ports that the Goler and Summit districts

liam Lonigan, for failing to obey the

no< seek his superior officer and get ex
cuaed, as did one or two others of the
company who were unable from sickness
or other similar cause to turn out with the
company.
This is the first time in this city, within
the knowledge of local military men, that
an arrest has been made for this breach of
the military and penal laws. Other cases
similar to this have occurred in other
cities up the valley, but none here.
TO BAD THE QUARANTINR.
Washington Authorities Interested in the
Cattlemen's Behalf.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 21.â Dr. C. A.
Ruggles has returned from tne East,
whither he went to attend the national
conference of the State Boards of Health,
which was held at Chicago, and also to
have an interview witn the authorities at
Washington in reference to the Texas
fever, which was said to be prevalent
among the cattle of this State, and on ac
count of which the cattle were refused
transportation out of the State. In speak
in g of the success of his mission in the
latter capacity to-day the doctor said:
"I called upon Secretary Morton, the
Commissioner of Agriculture, and had a
conference with him and Dr. Salmon, the
Chief of Animal Industry. The gentle
men remarked that we were in a pretty
bad position, but lurtner than that bad
nothing to say. It was then suggested
that the United States Government send
an inspector to this State, to be joined
here by a person appointed by Governor
Budd to accompany nim, and that the
two make a thorough inspection of the
cattle and then make a reconim ndation
to the Legislature to pass a law to meet
the emergency. The suggestion was
gladly accepted and approved.
"We then talked over the best time of
the year to make the examination, and I
suggested the Ist prox., which was agreed
upon. I will now write to Governor Budd
asking him when I could have an inter
view with him in reference to my mis
sion."
SUES SONSOMA'S SHERIFF.
Thomas Coleman Asks for Damages for
False Imprisonment.
SANTA ROSA, Cal.. July 21.â Thomas
Coleman has commenced an action against
Sheriff S. I. Allen and his bondsmen for
$6000 damages, alleged to have been sus
tained because of his arrest and imprison
ment here a few days ago.
Coleman was arrested by the Sheriff on
suspicion of his being the "bad man from
Idaho," Jack Davis, alias Diamocdrield
Jack, wanted in Cassia County, Idaho, for
several murders and attempted murders
and for whom $4600 reward is offered.
The plaintiff alleges that he was com
pelled to shave off vis beard and submit
to having nis picture taken for the rogues'
gallery, ami for this he asks $2000. He
has retained Mrs. F. McG. Martin, the
well-known woman lawyer, to carry his
case to a final conclusion.
Santa Rosa Taxes.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., July 21.â The
County Board of Equalization finished its
work last evening and adjourned.
The board made many reductions in
assessments throughout the county, but
den ieri tbe petitions of about a dozen of
the heaviest taxpayers in this City. In
the motion of refusal it said:
All of the applications were filed at or about
12 o'clock (noon) Saturday, July 18. The
Board of Equalization has no authority by
la*v to continue in session later than Monday,
Jul 20.
We have given the said matter as care
ful consideration as the short time allowed us
permitted. We realize the values placed on
said hinds are too high, but when we come to
compare values as placed on land in
Santa Rosa and upon lands outside of the
towns we find that all descriptions of lands
under the present conditions of profits
and incomes to owners are assessed in
excess of their true assesssable value;
but it now appears that the only
way to obtain relief is to apply to the
State Board ot Equalization for a reduction on
ull lands of the county. It is therefore or
dered that the petitions be denied.
Displeased, Baptist Ministers.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., July 21.-There is
considerable comment among the Baptists
about the changing of the convention for
1898 from Denver to Chattanooga. The
delegates say that one reason for the
change was that the new board of mana
gers felt aggrieved at tbe usurpation of its
power by the retiring board, and tbat
it took a slight excuse to change the de
cision.

LOVED By ALL
LOS ANGELES.
Bishop Mora's Withdrawal
Regretted in City and
Diocese.
HE WILL GO TO SPAIN.
Will Depart When the Church
Property Is Transferred to
His Successor.
BISHOP MONTGOMERY TALKS.
Deplores the Insinuation That the
Aged Prelate's Resignation Was
Not Voluntary.
Lob Angei.es Office of ThÂ« Call, j
328 South Broadway, >
Los Angei.es, Cal., July 21. )
Francis Mora, the Bishop of the diocese
of Monterey and Los Angeles, who afier
forty years of continuous labors in behalf
of the church, during fifteen years or
which he has been in charge of a bishop
ric, has resigned his position and been suc
ceeded by George Montgomery, Coadjutor
Bishop for the past two years, will soon
depart for Spain.
Bishop Mora to-day spoke of his early
work of years ago among t ; e sparsely
populated settlement in Southern Cali
fornia, of his trips on horseback over
mountains and valleys. Durine all these
years, the Bishop said, with a pathos in
his voice, the relations to his people and
the authorities above him had always
been pleasant. He said he would spend
the remaining yeai 3 of his life in Spain,
and as the titular Bishop would be assured
of an income sufficient to supply his daily
wants.
Notwithstanding the hundreds of thou
sands of dollars' worth of property in
uiing to the church in his name and
during his official career, the Bisbop quits
the scene of his labor a poor man. He
does not own one foot of land in Cali
fornia. All of the splendid church prop
erties of more than forty parishes will pass
into the hands of Bishop Montgomery, to
be held for the church. When the trans
fer of this vast wealth has been com
pleted Bishop Mora, crowned with honors
and beloved by thousands, will retire.
Bishop Montgomery said this afternoon:
"I have little to say except that it shall be
my constant prayer that the interest of
the church shall not suffer by this change,
and that in the discharge of my duties I
shall ever try to emulate the example left
by my noble and faithful predecessor."
The Bishop said tnat a local newspaper,
in speaking of the change, had insinuated
tbat there bad been misunderstanding
and trouble between Bishop Mora and
Rome. This had annoyed the retiring
Bishop greatly, for it was so utterly un
founded and unjust. The truth was that
Bishop Mora had been a splendid success
in every department of his work, had al
ways showed great business sagacity and
had ever enjoyed tbe fullest esteem and
confidence of his superiors.
The great properties he left behind him
attested ihis. He has never, said Bishop
Montgomery, acquired any property with
out the full knowledge and consent of the
church authorities, and always for the
church and not for himself.
The incoming Bishop, who was for many
years a priest in San Francisco, is notonly
popular with the members of his church
in this city, but with all classes of people.
INSULTED ALBION'S FLAG
Policemen Must Apologize to British
Vice-Contul Mortimer.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 21.â Owing
to a display of excessive patriotism on the
part of Officers McLean, Baker and Rey
nolds of the police force of this city, these
gentlemen will, as a result of the action of
the Police Commission to-day, be com
pelled to masticate a bit of humble pie by
way of an apology to her British Majesty's
Vice-Consul Mortimer, stationed in this
city. The anxiety of the three policemen
to tweak the British lion's tail on Indepen
dence day is thf cause of the trouble.
The officers have been under suspension
for some time and their cases came up for
fanal determination to-day. Vice-Consul
Mortimer had been considerate enough to
write a letter to Chief Glass, sayinc tbat
he attributed their lack of diplomacy to
ignorance when on July 4 they demanded
that the Consul haul down the British
flag from his quarters and substitute the
Stars and Stripes. Mr. Long of the Comm
issioners said that in his opinion the
officers should not draw pay for the time
during which they were suspended, and
that tney should call upon Vice-Consul
Mortimer to express regret at thbir hasty
action, after which they should be re
instated.
Another communication from the Brit
ish Vice-Consul was filed. The substance
of it was that he was notified that the
men meant no disrespect, and he desires
to see them reinstated. Commissioner
Barham gave the men a little fatherly ad
vice about the enormity of tneir offense
and the trouble their act might have
caused the city. Officer Baker declared
that he hardly felt that he nad any apol
ogy to make, since he had only happened
to be with the others at the time. The
Chief stated tbat Officer Baker was as
much to blame as the rest.
After the officers hat departed Commis
sioner Ba;:iam said that he believed the
investigation of Officer Baker would be
continued.
"I don't like to see such an innocent
man suffer, ' said Barham. "If Baker has
made any misstatement here, and wÂ« find
it out, Officer Baker should be dismissed
from the force."
The Chief was directed to further investi
gate Baker's part in the matter.

ANTI-AJMWXATIOSIHTB TIELD.
Lou Angeles Will Acquire a Large Sec
tion of suburban Territory.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 21.-The
anti-annexation suit brought by Attorney-
General Fitzgerald against the city of Los
Angele- on complaint of one Ledgewood
received a death blow in the Superior
Court to-day. The disgruntled ones who
were out of sorts over the recent annexa
tion of suburban territory have weakened,
and as a result Ledgewood has decided to
let go.
In this proceeding it. was claimed that
for numerous reasons the annexation elec
tion was illegal, and it was sought to ob
tain a judgment of the court prohibit
ing the city from entering the annexed
territory and exercising municipal control
over it. When the case was called to-day a
statement was made by plaintiff's coun
sel that, on account of a failure on the part
of the plaintiff to supply the neoe&sarv
funds with which to go ou with the littga
lion, counsel desired to withdraw from the
case.
The counsel of record were: John W.
Mitchell, Frank A. Cattden, G. P. Adams,
F. M. Porter, and on motion Judge York
directed, that an order be made showing
the withdrawal that the Attorney-Gen
eral be notified and that the cau^e be con
tinued.
The action of counsel this morning is
regarded as a practical termination of the
opposition ana it is expected that to-mor
row the finishing toucnes will be put to
the collapse of the litigation.

cussed Franklin Pierce, the Democratic
Presidential choice in the fifties, and told
of the troublesome conditions which ex
isted during that period. An able lecture
on American citizenship was delivered in
the afternoon by Rev. Carlos Martyn. He
said that tho trend of population was
toward the cities, and it was of ti.e utmost
importance that they should be properly
governed. He believed in disfranchising
every one who did. not vote. Frank Lin
coln, the humorist, entertained tne audi
ence in the evening.
Messtnore Would Go to Congress.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 21.â Colonel
Isaac E. Messmore has authorized a Call
correspondent to say to the voters of the
Sixth Congressional District that he is a
candidate (or Congress ; that his candidacy
is not the result of "pressure from many
friends" or any party, nor yet because he
has been a wine merchant for forty years,
but because his friends regard him as a
decent sort of fellow Â»nd of first-class abil
ity, in which view he modestly concurs.
He is a candidate.

fried," the third part of Wagner's
tetralogy, "Der Ring dcs Nibelungen,"
was performed to-day at the Restspiel

were flat, but at the finish Mme. Lilie
Lehmann's magnificent impersonation of
Brunnhilde aroused tne enthusiasm of the
audience.

mbus ball game toÂ«day tbe row which had
occurred in the third inning between Um
pire Clark and Catcher Wilson of the Co

joining Buildings Destroyed.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., July 21.âNay
lor's Opera-House and three adjoining
buildings were destroyed by fire to-night,
causing a loss of $150,000 to $175,000, with

sort witn about 200 population, is in Im
minent danger of destruction by forest
fires. The flames have crept down the
sides of the Cascades and into tne foot
hills where tbe village is located and
threaten to consume everything.
For several days it has been with the
greatest difficulty and danger that trains
on the Northern Pacific road have suc
ceeded in passing Hot Springs owing to
the proximity of fire to the track and the
intensity of the heat. A great forest fire
has also been raging above What com,
cansing practically a suspension of opera
tions on the Bellingham Bay and North
ern Railroad detween Sehome Junction
and Sumas, thus forcing the Canadian
Pacific to bring its cars into Seattle over
tbe Seattle ana International Railway, a
portion of the Lake Shore system.

WOES OF DEMOCRACY.
Buckleyites Come Very Near to Going
Ahead Regardless of Anybody.
The executive committee of the Buckley
Democratic organization held a long and
warm session last evening with James H.
O'Brien in the chair.
The principal discussion was over a reso
lution by D. M. Gavigan, secretary of the
general committee, providing for local
primaries on September 11 and calling a
municipal convention for September 15.
The importance of this resolution was
tbat it meant a rinal and definite step
ahead as an independent organization, or
rather as the regular Democratic party,
without reference to the Junta or to any
of the vague propositions for party har
mony that are going about. The Buck
leyites claim, with strong reason and
much evidence, to be the regular and legal
party organization, and are quite ready to
put up a municipal ticket and fight in tlie
courts to have it placed upon the official
ballot as the Democratic ticket.
The meeting was a largely attended one,
and nearly everybody present bad a good
deal to say. The general temper of the
committee was one of readiness to go
ahead, but several counseled waiting for
at least a week to see it any further pros
pects of compromise at all fair to both
sides appeared. It was finally decided by
a small majority to postpone action on the
resolution tor one week.
A committee to secure new and larger
headquarters was appointed, and the com
mittee on registration, consisting of
James H. O'Brien, Joseph Rothschild and
William Humphreys, was enlarged by
the appointment of M. J. Donovan, J. C.
Ncalon, D. M. Gavigan and Charles Mc-
Carthy.
This committee was enlarged for the spe
cial purpose of making a roar of greater
volume before the Election Commission
ers in behalf of the recognition of the regu
lar Democratic organization in the ap
pointment of election officers, which seem
to be going mainly to the Junta, and the
committee will be heard from to-day.
There was a little bit of a Democratic
political play in Judge Conlan's court last
night, where P. F. Dundon had a second
session of his own committee on party
harmony.
Very few of the people whom Mr. Dun
don invited were present, and George
Godfrey was the only representative of the
Junta there. The Buckleyites present
merely carre to see what was done and to
stave things off. So Mr. Dundon goes
ahead unifying the party, with neither
faction taking any stocK in his labors.
Fire Commissioner McDonald presided,
and among those present were J. F. Twige,
Fleet F. Strother, John McCarthy, A. M.
Armstrong, Samuel Haskins, E. J. Rey
nolds and Charles Wesley Reed.
P. F. Dundon again urged his scheme of
ail the district committees setting to
gether. Fleet F. Strother ironically called
Dundon "the great pacificator," and on
motion of John McCarthy, who wants
Maguire, White and some more such big
men to bump rival beads together, the
meeting adjourned to the call of the chair,
which is not likely to be expressed.
USED MURPHY'S NAME.
Five Thousand Dollars Obtained on a
Forged Note From a Broker.
Detective Stillwell is at present busily
seeking the whereabouts of a dashing
young financier. When caugnt a charge
of forgery will confront him.
The young man whom several persons
are so anxious to find is Norman Schuller,
a young money broker, who has been as
sociated in business with his father, An
drew Schuller, a prominent local financier,
doing business oi Montgomery street
Attorney John C. Hughes, who has also
the reputation of being a snrewd and able
financier, is the man who ia so anxious to
find the young man.
"About three months ago," said Attor
ney Hughes last evening, "young Schul
ler came to my office saying that he had
been engaged by B. D. Murphy, the San
Jose capitalist, to negotiate a loan of $5000.
Schuller offered to secure a three-month
note signed by B. D. Murphy and indorsed
by P. W. Murphy and his sister, Mrs.
Mary E. Carroll of this City. Upon these
securities I was only too willing to make a
loan and accordingly agreed to let Schul
ler have the money.
"A few days later be returned with the
note, dated May 3, and signed and in
dorsed, apparently, as he had promised. I
did not attempt to verify the signatures,
as I had implicit faith in youne Schuller
and knew his father weli. Besides, tbe
loan was sought about the time that
Barney Murphy's bank was in temporary
difficulties, and I thought it the most
natural thing in che world tbat he should
be trying to raise a little ready money. I
hac". negotiated a loan of $40,000 for him
some time previous and suspected noth
ing.
"Within the past few weeks my suspi
cions were aroused. I made some investiga
tions and accused Scnuller of having forged
the note. He denied tbe charge. While
professedly vorifying the signatures, how
ever, he left for parts unknown."
B. D. Murphy could not be found in
town last night. His sister, Mrs. M. E.
Carroll, when interviewed at her resi
dence on Van Ness avenue and California
street, declared that she had never signed
such a note and was positive that neitiier
of her brothers had done so.
Palace Restaurant Closed.
I The Sheriff took charge of the Palace res
taurant at 807 Market street , yesterday after
noon upon an attachment issued by Henarick
son's Law and Collection Agency for the
amount of $133.
As soon as the Sheriff presented himself the
proprietors, A. Young and Robert Matthey
left the place, â  claiming that it had been
transferred to Hofmann and Woenne of the
Montgomery market. It is stated that other
claims will be presented as soon as the Sheriff's
office opens for business this morning.
The help took the example of their employ
ers and left the place, as they saw no signs of
drawing their week's pay.

KT.KCTION MIVKMBKR .1. 1896.
Bad as Cleveiandism has been Rryanism
â¢would be worse.
We may count the Fifth District as safe
lor a Republican Congressman.
Bryan Democracy in its last analysis is
only Rainey Democracy with a larger pull.
We hardly need a weather bureau report
to tell v* it will be hot In St. Louis to
day.
If Bryan has any more words to con
jure with now is the time for him to use
them.
Once more we remind yon of your duty
to register and to get your friends to regis
ter also.
Consider what would be the condition of
the American sailor if Sewall should ever
get to be President.
The cause of woman suffrage marches
along and you will be left if you do not
join the procession.
The Democrats of the Fifth District have
been true to the traditions of the party
and made the usual blunder.
The kind of reform Democracy will give
the people is shown by the nomination for
Congress m the Fifth District.
A little while ago California was re
garded as a <ioubtful State, but that com
plexion of things is changing rapidly.
â . Â»â â â _â _
The chances are Bryan will talk his fol
lowers into such a tired feeling they won't
have energy enough to go to the polls.
Bryan will not object to Populists stay
ing in the middle of the road, provided
they will lie down and let him walk over
t . :h.
Joseph P. Kelly is hereby informed that j
his nomination by Lanigan and Rainey
does not vindicate his record, bin con
firms it.
It takes poid Democracy a long time to
make up its mind, but probably it nas not
yet succeeded In finding any mind to
rnnke up.
Anti-Bryan Democracy in the East is
not half so much needed for the welfare
of the party as an anti-Rainey Democracy
in California.
(jorruan is oue Eastern Democrat who
will stay with the Chicago ticket, but no
Democratic organ in the \Vest is adver
tising the fact.
If the Democrats are to get any profit
out of Sewall's reputation, they will have
to use it for foreign export and not for
home consumption.
This is goinp to be a year of victories for
the American home; and the home indus
try, the home market and the home
keeper will all share in it.
Kvery speech of MeKinley appeals to the
patriotic instincts of the people, and that
is tbe reason the response is always marked
by ardor and enthusiasm.
In the increased export of gold we see
the first evidences of the monetary panic
which Bryan and his Democracy are trying
to force upon the country.
It is more than probable that Kelly's
nomination for Congress by tbe Democrats
of the Fifth District was due to bis estab
lished reputation as a sack carrier.
It is better o have wort for unemployed
men and pay a little more for horue-made
goods than to have foreign goods cheap
while American labor goes a-begging.
The Democratic bolt in California this
year will be bigger than tbe crowd that
doesn't bolt. It will be the aog leaving
the tail aud not the tail dropping from the
dog.
The nearest Democracy can come to giv
ing the people a candidate who means
business is to nominate a fellow who is
reputed to have had experience in several
kinds of jobs.
In the present condition of the fight
against tbe funding bill no man should be
elected to Congress from California who is
not above .suspicion. He must have a
character as well as a platform.
There can be no question of the import
ance of this election to every business in
terest of the country, and therefore every
business man should make it a part of his
work to secure the success of the advance
agent of prosperity.
Tbe Republican party is receiving a
strong infusion of young blood, and it is
safe to say that fully two-thirds of the
young men who this year cast their first
vote in a Presidential election will cast it
Jo; ik&iuley and Hobart.
THE PARCE IN THE FIFTH.
The nomination for Congress made by
the Democrats of the Fifth District and
the circumstances under which it was
made afford the people a fair illustration
of >he extent aud quality of Democratic
practices of reform. In no part of the
Union has Democracy made a greater
pretense of overthrowing its own bosses
nor given more vociferous pledges of purity
and reform than in California. Yet in this
case, with lungs still feeling the strain of
their yells against Buckley, the Democrats
have nominated for Congress a kid raised
in the Buckley fold and tarred with the
Buckley stick.
The Democrats of the Fifth District are
not wicked above other Democrats. The
general quality of the party is the same
the country over. With an occasional ex
ception here and there due to local causes
the party convention in every Congres
sional district v.iJl be controlled by forces
and influences not widely different from
those which dominated at Redwood and
the men nominated will measure about
the same in character, ability, reputation
and experience as Joseph Kelly. It is
worth while, therefore, to give attention to
that nomination in order to know what
manner of men are now running the
Democratic party.
It is the claim, we believe, of Mr. Kelly's
friends that ihev nominated him for vin
dication. Mr. Kelly is reported to have
himself told the convention tnat he de
sired to run in defense of his honor and
reputation, because in bis last race he had
been charged with being "a corporation
lawyer." Our recollection is that he was
charged witn something quite different
from any kind of legal practice, but as
neither he nor his friends mentioned it we
may let it pass. Taking the statements as
made at Redwood it would seem that Mr.
Kelly and Iris friends are willing to wear
all other charges made two years ago, but
from that of being a lawyer employed by
corporations they demand vindication and
hope to gat it by an appeal to the people.
To this desire Rainey and Lanigan gave
their consent and Mr. Kelly will ask the
Democrats of the Fifth District to wash
his dirty linen for him and make him
clean again.
That is the way Democracy practices
politics in tlie face of some of the most
stupendous issues ever submitted to the
arbitration of a popular vote. As a Nation
we have to undertake the complex prob
lem of adjusting the tariff for the protec
tion of American industry and providing
a revenue for the Government ; we have to
engage in 1 lie momentous task of readjust
ing the monetary standard upon which all
business is based; we have to deal with
many questions of foreign policy, not a
few of which involve possibilities of war;
and in additiou to these National issues
we, of California, have to confront in Con
gress a powerful lobby seeking to perpetu
ate a railroad monopoly that would
harass every industry and cinch every
enterprise of the State for fifty years to
corce.
Instead of nominating as a candidate for
Congress a man able to deal with these
great issues, the Democrats of the Fifth
District ignore them all and flippantly ask
the people to vote for a man to vindicate
him from the charge of being a lawyer
whom corporations occasionally think it
worth while to employ. From this fact
we can estimate the quality and degree of
the political ideas of Lanigan and Rainey
and the men who follow them. To such
men and indeed to most of those who con
trol Democracy in these dnys it would
seem that politics is little more than a
circus where each individual rider desires
to ride the trick mule and win applause.
Kvery candidate of the party is clamoring
for vindication, gratification or gloritica
cation. Egotism dominates the whole
crowd from Bryan to Kelly. They are
turning the campaign into a farce which
is ridiculous to common-sense and offen
sive to patriotism. It is not to be won
dered that decent Democrats are turning
from their party with diseust and indig
nation. There are very few self-respecting
men even among Democrats who will care
in a campaign of such importance as this
to devote their time to washing Mr. Kelly's
dirty linen.
WHO PAYS THE DUTIES?
A free-trade contemporary puts a ques-
I tion to protectionists which it appears to
i think they dare not attempt to answer.
The question is, ""Who pays the duties if
the consumer does not? And If the con
j sumer pays them, how is it that you say the
foreigner pays me duties?" The trouble
with our contemporary is it jumps at con
clusions without looking to see where it
jumps from or what it is likely to light
upon. But the doctrine of free trade is
the enemy ol logic and will not permit its
use in the analysis of any economic prob
lem, and hence it is not surprising that the
campaign cry of ~our people pay thp
duties that are collected under protection"
and '-the nearer free trade the country
gets the cheaper will the consumer get his
supplies" should be heard in the land.
The economic principle upon which the
Republican party's demand for protection
is based certainly aoes contemplate the
payment of customs duties by the importer
and, we may say, the policy of the party
has no other thought than that the tax
upon goods aud ware* of foreign manufac
ture consumed in this country shall be
paid by the manutacturer. The object of
a protective tariff is twofold. The first
purpose is to afford such encouragement
I to nome capital that It will feel justified in
j undertaking the work of transforming do
mestic raw materials into merchantable
articles which in turn would operate to
give continuous employment to home me
j chanical skill and brawn at wages which
shall leave a reasonable margin of profit
wherewith to provide a home turner indi
vidual ownership,- and which would in
turn again make the United States the
leading manufacturing nation, as it is now
the leading agricultural nation. The sec
ond purpose of a protective tariff is to
oblige those foreigners who would com
pete with us in our own markets to pay a
tax for the privilege.
If a duty were put upon tea, coffee, rub
ber or any other article of consumption
which we do not produce in this country
j certainly our consumers would, pay the
tax, but the theory of the Republican
tariff doctrine is that all articles of com
merce which cannot be produced to ad
vantage in this country should not be du
tiable and being on the free list their cost to
our consumers would be at the lowest point.
On the other hand, as to articles we can
manufacture from our raw material, such
as iron, woolen good*, cotton labrics and
a multitude of other commodities, the
Republican party would levy a tax upon
goods and wares of a like kind manufac
tured 'in other countries. That is to say,
importers of foreign-made articles would
nave to pay a tax before they could enter
our markets, and the tax would be so ad
justed that our industries could maintain
the American scale of wages for our work
ing people and still leave them a profit on
their investment. !By that means good*
and â¢ wares for home consumption would '
not be ' arbitrarily advanced, but good
prices would^tjave to be maintained to
hold tlie wage scjtadujei witfice^i

operatives could have a margin of profit
or surplus between income and expendi
ture.
The introduction of foreign-made ar
ticles of consumption would not, under
such a tariff, reduce domestic prices, but
it would i;ive the market the life of sharp
competition, which, in tarn, would prevent
the formation of "corners" between mills
and factories to advance values beyond
what supply and demand would justify.
Now, the free-trader would say, "But if
there were no tariff would not prices for
goods and wares be materially lower
down to the basis of what the foreign
competitor would sell them for?" Cer
tainly they would be cheaper under free
trade; but free trade would also close our
mills and factories, stop the marketing of
raw materials, close up the farmers' mar
ket, throw the wage-earner out of employ
ment, send the capital engaged in indus
tries to safe-deposit vaults and turn our
merchandise markets over to the foreigner.
But be would not sell many goods, for
our people would be idle and penniless.
The Republican theory of protection is
that Americans should be permitted to
develon the resources of their own country
and reap all the benefits accruing there
from.
REBUKE THEM.
The gold reserve of the United States
Treasury is now more than $10,000,000 be
low the legal requirement. On the day
the Chicago convention adopted a sec
tional and repudiation platform the re
serve showed a healthy surplus, but im
mediately upon the adoption of that dec
laration money began to grow timid, and
the run that is now being made upon the
treasury Is the first fruits of the revolu
tionary purpose of the men who are in
control of the Democratic party. Not only
are American securities held abroad com
ing borne for redemption, but our own
people are beginning to rent boxes in safe
deposit banks. Nor is this fear of ap
proaching danger confined to men of this
or that political party or to capitalists. It
is being felt throughout all the ways ol
trade, traffic and investment. â¢*â¢
But the Chi?aeo platform and the utter
ances of Mr. Bryan are quite enough to
make people everywhere wonder whither
we are drifting. The people of the United
States, or the thinking ones, had made up
their minds that we were on the eve of re
vamping our monetary system upon the
basis of bimetallic redemption money, and
confidence was beginning to be restored in
the channels of business. It was agreed
that the plan set forth in the platform of
the Republican party would piace the gold
and the silver dollar side by side whither
soever America's commerce might go.
Foreign nations have seen and read the
declaration of economic and monetary
principles which the St. Louis convention
had commissioned Mr. MeKinley to estab
lish, and already the bimetallists in Eng
land and Germany had taken favorable
action.
But Mr. Bryan's wild aud unbusiness
like utterances are alarming people. He
declares it to be his policy to utterly ig
nore the peopie in other countries witn
whom we sustain profitable credit and
business relations, aud cram his kind of
Bilver down the throat of commerce by
force. It certainly is unfortunate that the
business situation should be so disturbed,
and it is still more unfortunate that bis
threats should cause more than $10,000,000
to be drawn from tue treasury in a fort
night. But the people should not be need
lessly alarmed. Let them rally to the
standard of McKinley, and by the moral
force of such a rallying they would do
much to restore confidence to the world of
business. Bryan and his fallacious the
ories |will be repudiated. There is no
doubt ai all about that. The monetary
system ol the country will be put upon a
true bimetallic ba->is by the Republican
party, and the best thing for the people to
do meanwhile is to grow more and more
determined that the country shall have
protection and prosperity. That is tvÂ»
way to rebuke the Altgelds and the Bry
ans.
A GOOD KIND OF "PARALYSIS."
Bryan's alleged platform has a good deal
to say about the prosperity of the people
being '-locked fast in the paralysis of hard
times," and of course the Republican
party and the demonetization of silver in
1873 are blamed for it all. Let us see how
that is. in ISTO there was $1, 700,000,000
invested in manufactures, and in 1890
there was 16,200,000.000 invested in mills
and factories, and the value of the output
of these industrial enterprises in 1890 was
considerably over $9,000,000,000 against
$3,400,000,000 in 1870. In 1870 the total
number of wage-earners employed in
manufacturing concerns was L,000,000 and
in 1890 there were 4.500,000.
These figures show an increase which
obtains in all lines of business since 1870,
except that since the repeal of the tariff
act of 1890 there has been an enormous
shrinkage of values in all kinds of
property, to say nothing of idleness en
forced upon hundreds of thousands of
working people. There has been a good
deal of "paralysis," as Mr. Bryan's plat
form says, and "an industrial people" are
still "locked" in its deadly embrace, but
there were not even symptoms of paralysis
until in a thoughtless moment the people
permitted Mr. Bryan's party to inaugurate
a policy of industrial wreck and ruin.
But, then, the makers of the Chicago
platform started in to get as far as possible
from the truth in ail things, and bring to
gether In one little group the most mon
strous falsehoods that could be culled from
a "paralytic" imagination. It has alwayb
been the custom of the Democratic party
to diverge widely from the truth in cam
paign times, but when it is remembered
that the Chicago convention got its in
spiration from Altgeld, Tilman and
repudiated politicians the spirit of ttie
platform is not so much to be wondered at.
JEFFERSOU AND BIMETALLISM.
Democratic free silver orators continue
to harp on "the money of the constitu
tion I 'â meaning gold and silver â aud de
mand that the white metal be reinstated
at tb* ratio of 16 to 1. Either they do not
know, or are playing upon the supposed
credulity of their hearers, but anyway, the
constitution does not name gold and sil
ver a* money metaifu
It was not deemed advisable in the
act of 179*2 to coin dollar pieces of
gold, because they would be incon
veniently small, but silver dollars were
ordered minted on the basis of fif
teen times as much silver to the dollar as
there would be in a gold dollar, were gold
dollars minted. That is to say, the mone
tary unit, "the dollar," contained enough
silver to be tbe equivalent of one-fifteenth
of its weight in gold, but the silver dollar,
as such, was not made tbe monetary unit
of value. Our system of coinage was
adopted because it was believed that the
decimal way of designating money, i. c.
dollar, half-dollar, quarter-dollar, dime
and half-dime, wonld prove to be very
much more convenient than the pound,
shilling and pence system of England.
Bimetallism was thus established and
for convenience, gold coins called eagles, i
thorized. A few years afterward President
Jefferson, upon discovering that the bul
lion price of the silver dollar had depre
ciated to about 97 cents, and that the
shrinkage in value was driving gold from
the country, ordered the minfs to discon
tinue the coinage of silver dollars, and con
sequently, with the exception of 1000 silver
dollar pieces, not a silver dollar was coined
by the mints between the years 1805 and
1839.
Mr, Jefferson was quick to discover that
bimetallism could not be maintained by
the United States independent of the com
mercial nations when either metal as bul
lion fell below its coin value. He readily
saw that if the mints remained open to
the free coinage of the white metal, inde
pendent of other commercial countries,
this country would very soon be upon a
silver monetary basis with the dollar
representing two separate and distinct
values.
Mr. Jefferson did not believe that the
parity of the metals could be maintained
by merely issuing an edict that it should
be maintained, and when the modern
Democrat tries to prove his insane vaga
ries by quoting from the founder o! the
Democratic party, he is either ignorant or
dishonest. Undoubtedly, President Jef
ferson was a bimetallist, but he realized
that commerce is very exacting in its de
mands, and that it will accept only money
thai stands for the same value every
where. Were Mr. Jefferson alive to-day
tfiere is no doubt at all that he would be
found in accord with the Republican
party's plan to establish bimetallism,
which is to call together all parties in in
terest and have them declare that a
bimetallic monetary system shall prevail
everywhere throughout the commercial
world.

OMAHA. July 10, 1896.â T0 thr H'orld, A>w
York: Within the short space of one week
William Jennings Brfan has emerged from
comparative obscurity to find himself the sub
ject of National solicitude and international
discussion and speculation. With his name
on every tongue, his portrait in all the papers,
and his movements and utterances given with
minuteness to the country by Associated Press
dispatches and special correspondents, Bryan
has suddenly loomed into the horizon as one
of the two foremost figures in the great Na
tional drama that is about to be played on
America's political stage. The story of his
esrly life, his academic training, apprentice
ship as a lawyer, h.s ioren*ic triumphs in the
schoolhouse and on the political rostrum, his
career in Congress and intrusion into the
arena of journalism have furnished ma
terial for the people who absorb with
avidity all that it said and written con
cerning the man who captivated a great Na
tional convention with bis eloquence and
carried away the laurel crown for which the
greatest of his party's leaders had been striv
ing. With all that bag already been published
coneeruinn Bryan's physical and mental make
up, his habits ami his associations, the popu
lar conception ot the man is vtgue, and the
World is therefore well justified in asking me
to supply some data for a true estimate of his
ability, character and capacity for tilling the
high ofliie to which he now aspires.
Without pretending to have an intimate ac
quaintance with Mr. Uryan. my opportunities
for gauging the man have been ample. Meas
ured by the standard of men truly great, Wil
liam JenniiiÃS Bryan rfiil scarcely take rank
with eminent political leaders of the Demo
cratic school such as were Stephen A. Douglas,
John C. Breckinrlage, Horatio Seymour, Allen
it. Tliurniiin.Thnina* A. Hendricks, Samuel J.
Randall, to say nothiuj of Samuel J. Tilden,
Thomas P. Bayard or Davii B. UilL While
gifted with oratorical powers of a high order,
Bryan" lacks both depth and breadth. He
is a popularizer of oilier men's ideas rather
than an original thinker, and has a catchy
way of presenting bis subjects to an audience.
He it n consummate actor, whofe forte lies in
appeals to sentiment and emotion rather than
in arguments and sound reasoning. He is a
born agitator, who never hesitates to employ
the weapons of the dftnagoKue to make a
point. Bryan's most vulnerable part is bis
lack of moral stamina and utter indifference to I
tbe maintenance of public integrity. While so
far as I kiiuw his private character is unim
peachable, be has never raited his voice or
used bis pen in denunciation of flagrant abu-e^
of public office or betrayal of public trnst, but,
on the contrary, has permitted the paper of
which he is ostensibly the responsible editor
to glose over and defend embezzlements in
public office, gross official negligence and cor
rupt collusion with uublic plunderers, even
where the offenders were foisted into office as
Republicans.
From the professional standpoint Mr. Bryan
may be considered a dismal tailure. His legal
practice has never amounted to anything
worth mentioning. His venture in the news
paper business has not been regarded as
serious in these parts. While he has been
nominal editor of the Omaha World-Herald
since September 1, 1894. be has in reality been
a mere journalistic figurehead. His name has
been paraded at the head of the weekly edi
tion to draw free-silver deiusionists, but was
soon taken out of the daily and has not been
replaced. Instead of devoting his time to the
paper he has been traveling about tbe conn
try live weeks out of six as the paid chainprbu
of the Bimetallic league.
As a politician Bryan has displayed no or
gauiziug ability. He is a good stump speaker
and an effective campaigner, but that is all.
If he has any executive capacity it has uot yet
manifested itself. He has never held any ex
ecutive position and has never had an oppor
tunity to exercise any faculty he may possibly
possess in tnat direction. The best business
men of Omaha, regardless oi party, look upon
him as a man of immature judgment, who
would constitute an extrahasaraous risk as
head of the National Government.

DEVELOPING THE SUGAR INDUSTRY
Philadelphia L*dt*r. ,
If Clan* Spreckels can put in operation the
grand scheme he, is ; said to have developed to
promote the beet-sugar industry he will con
fer a great benefit upon , this country, which
will be in no wise diminished by the incidental
profit to himself. He Is reported as saying
that before 'he i started on his present visit to
Europe he mailed to every farmer in California
a pamphlet urging him to grow sugar beets.
Now he is coming borne with the intention of
starting three or four factories, with a capacity
of consuming 6000 tons of beets daily. If he
does this the farmers may be safely trusted to
do the rest,' provided the price he is willing to
pay for the beets is a remunerative one. There
is a market in this country for a great deal
more sugar than. the Southern cane field* can
supply. We import , thousands of ? tons of Ger
man and '. Frencn beet sugar every year. If
Mr. Sprecicels can ' induce the American farm-
, ers 10 tftiie up tbiÂ» industry Â»n4 mssiriJn
market themselves be will accomplish a great
work. It looks like a simple proposition, but
a sticking point will probably be found in the
subsidies paid to foreign sugar producers,
which the American growers would have to
do without.

GENUINE BIMETALLISM.
Tulare Register.
Let it never be forgotten that the Repub
lican party of this Nation is not committed to
the single gold standard as a preferred theory
of money; that it stands now as it has ever
stood for bimetallism, but that it believes that
the only bimetallism possible is International
bimetallism and that independent free coinage
would not only not result in bimetallism but
in a silver monometallism, which nobody
wants and which would yield all our gold up
to Europe and postpone real bimetallism in
definitely. All Repnblicans are bimetallism
and the existing standard is adhered to only
until such time as true bimetallism can be ob
tained in the only way possibleâ by interna
tional agreement.
BRYAN'S "CROSS" AND "CROWN."
New York Evening Post.
Mr. Bryan's oratorical powers are not marked
by great versatility. It has been shown already
that his speech which carried the Chicago con
vention off its feet and made him the nominee
for President was mainly one which he had de
livered a week earlier in a joint debate. He
declaimed it in the convention as a sponta
neous burst of pure eloquence, but the body of
it and the closing passage, with its crown of
thorns and cross of gold, had been delivered
only a few days before to another audience.
Now it appears that even this first audience
had it second hand, for he closed a speech de
livered before a committee of Congress on De
cember 22, 1894, in opposition to a bill ex
empting the notes of State banks from taxa
tion, as follows:
"I, for one, will not yield to the demand. I
will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross
of gold. I will not aid them to press down upon
the bleeding brow of labor the crown of thorns."
Possibly this was not its first appearance.
Whenever the 'Boy Orator of the Piatte' gets
under the spell of his own eloquence ti^e crown
of thorns and cross of gold roll irresistibly from
his tongue. For an orator in his line of busi
ness tbe two figures are perfect. Nobody can
â¢ell what he means by them, but they are so
norous in delivery and have a Biblical flavor
which gives them the aspect of true prophecy.
When shouted forth by a man with waving
hair and upturned eyes they strike everybody
who is dissatisfied with the way the world is

THE COLOMBIA.
A PROPOSITION TO RAISE THE VESSEL AND PUT HER
IN TUB DRYDOCK.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Si c:
I notice the graphic articles you have pub
lished in your valuable journal in regard to
the wreck of the Colombia and the general
conclusion that both the agent of the vessel
and the newspaper press have come toâ that
she is a doomed vessel. There is no particular
necessity of coming to that conclusion, as the
vessel can be raised without much trouble by
only knowing how to go about it. Over
twe-Dty-five years ago, I came to California to
raise a vessel, and the owners would do noth
ing themselves nor give me an opportunity to
do anything with her, so there she lies till this
day. For the last twenty-five years I have of
fered my services to ship-owners to assist them
to raise wrecks, without success.
The tint step I should take in raising the
Colombia would be to put an artificial break
water to the ocean side of her, which would
completely insulate her from the force of the
waves, so that she would lie where she is
without any harm for weeks. This would cost
from $500 10 $750. I would then close up the
rent in her bottom, which, by means of my
patent marine patches and other original
methods unknown to the wrecking fraternity
would inside of three weeks make her bottom
perfectly watertight There is no reason what
ever why she should not be in the drydock in
side of five weeks from the time I commence
operations upon her.
Considering that this is midsummer and no
great storms are likely to arise, it would be
comparatively easy to raise the Colombia. All
that is required is to have the necessary appli
ances and know bow to use them.

GIRL'S CAPE.
Capos are indispensable for the sudden
changes that occur in the hottest season and
for evening wear.
Cloth is the fabric usually employed in mak
ing these pretty, comfortable and stylish
wraps. Plain lady's cloth simply stitched at
the edges with a bright lining for the hood is
stylish. Mixed tweeds with plain silk lining
for the hood make a serviceable garment.
Brown serge with a plaid silk lining for the
hood is youthful and pretty.
Double-faced cloths are especially nice for
these wraps, the hood thus displaying the con
trasting color of the other side. The cape is
seamless and appeals to the home dressmaker
as a garment easily made.

" Lake Mkrced-H. a, City. There is no City
ordinance "to prohibit any person properly at

waters of Lake Merced, but as the lake is one
of the sources of water supply for the City, the
Spring Valley Company prevents any one from
bathing therein. If a person should attempt
to do so it is certain that he would never want
to try the experiment again. The large plat
form at tHÂ« north cad ol tea l(UcÂ« was built iv

NEWS FROM THE
OVERDUE FLEET,
Several of Them Managed
to Reach Here Yes
terday.
ALL DELAYED OFF PORT.
The Progressist Reports Nine
Square-Riggers Off Point
Reyes.
REINSURANCE PAID ON THEM.
Several Steam-Schooners Tied Up
Own? to a Break-Dowa in
a Lumber Mill.
Gamblers on overdue ships were joyful
yesterday. The A. G. Ropes, on which 10
per cent reinsurance was paid, got in from
New York, and the City of Philadelphia,
on which 95 percent has been paid, has
been spoken this side of the Horn with all
well.
The British ship Cedarbank, now out
187 days from Antwerp and on which 25
per cent reinsurance was paid, wasspok-n
off Point Reyes and half a dozen other
vessels were sighted in the fog, all at
tempting to make port under unfavorable
circumstances. It is thought that nearly
all the overdue fleet is now outside await
ing a chance to get in. The fleet is as fol
lows: Jordan Hill, 179 days fiom Liver
pool, 30 per cent; City of Philadelphia, 170
days from New York, 95 per cent; Santa
Clara, 157 days from New York, 30 per
cent; Wilhelm Tell, 154 days from Swan
sea, 30 percent; Cedarbank, from Ant
werp, 25 per cent, and one or two others
which have already arrived in port.
ThÂ£ Morning She Was F..,0w- by the British Ship B re nda, Which BHn gS ,h e News
â  terday Was One of the Busies, in The Port in Months! : ?f^i|]^|! " Side of th Horn. The Scene at the Golden Gate Yes "
Among the arrivals yesterday was the
British ship Brenda from London. The
Star of France maie the run in 114 days,
but it took the Brenda 158 days to cover
the same distance. LiÂ«htwinds and calms
and heavy weather rounding the Horn
was the cause of the Brenda's delay. Can
tain Tulioch's report is as follows:
Sailed February 16. Hnd a fine rundown
the channel. Hnd fine northeast trades to the
equator. Crossed the equator March 12, longi
tude 26. 30 west. Had notherly winds to lati
tude 21 south. Then had >outherly and south
westerly winds to Cape Horn, which we passed
April 25.
Was forty-three days from 50 south in the
Atlantic to 50 Rf.ath in the Pacific. On April
23, latitude 55.40 south, longitude 64 west,
saw a four-masted baric with fore and main
mast gone at the cap and mizzen-mast at the
deck. The vessel had her signals set, but as it
was, blowing a heavy west-south west gale at
the time it was impossible to render her any
assistance. Six other shipi were also in sight
at the time.
Captain Tulioch's report of speaking
overdue ships is as follows:
April 2.â Latitude 34 south, longitude 48
west, British ship William Tell, 42 days out
from Swansea, for San Francisco.
May Iâ Latitude 57 south, longitude 68
tvest, 62 days out, ship City of Philadelphia,
from New York for San Francisco.
May 2.â La.itude 58 south, longitude 70
west. British bark Latham, 81 days out from
Swansea for San Francisco.
July 4.â Latitude 23 north, longitude 124
west, British ship Lauriston, 53 days out fjom
Sydney for San Francisco.
April 23.â Latitude 56 south, longitude 64
west, Brit sh ship Fulwood, from Grimsby ior
Portland, Or.
April 23.â Latitude 56 south, longitude 64
west, British ship Loch Linnhe, irom Hamburg
for San Francisco.
April 23.â Latitude 56 south, longitude 64
west, British ship Gulf Stream, from Antwerp
for Port Los Angeles.
On every one of these vessels more or less
reinsurance has been paid and the joy
among shipping meu was correspondingly
great when news of their having been
spoken was received.
The captain of the British whaleback
Progressist reported on his arrival yester
day that six miles west of Point Arena
he passed what he supposed io be the Brit
ish fchip Ventura. On the 21st inst., at 6
A. M., rive miles west of Point Reyes, he
passed the Cedarbank and at the same
time saw nine other vessels all trying to
make port. The weather was thick and
the wind light from the south. The
Cambuskenneth, another overdue ship,
now out 180 days from Humburg, was
spoken in latitude 55.34 south, longitude
79 west. Just what vessel in a dismantled
condition was spoken by the Brenda seems
to be in doubt, out the consensus of opin
ion among shipping men is that it was the
Undaunted, now out 182 days from Bal
timore. She has not been hoard from
since she passed Cape Henry on January
15 last.
The deep-water fleet presented a orettv

picture entering the Golden Gate yester
day. Captain Rivers on the A. G. Ropes
declined a tow and brought his vessel in
under full sail. The Brenda was towed in
and the Progressist came steaming in late
in the afternoon. A couple of Honolulu
packets also got in, and the Ventura, from
Comox, B. C, with coal, also put in an ap
pearance. With such a big fleet in sight
the chances are that business will again
boom on the water front
The ferry steamer Tiouron was delayed
half an hour on the 9 a. m. trip yesterday.
A small oolt in the machinery broke and
it took the chief engineer and his assist
ant quite a while to repair damages. Cap
tain White managed to make time, how
ever, and the steamer left on her usual 11
a. m trip punctually.
They had lots of fun with Frank Bragg
on Folsom-street wharf yesterday. One of
the Custom-house officers offered to bet
that he could tell his weight to a pound.
Frank took the bet and the weighing
began. Captains Randall, Hawley,
Haskells, Silovich, Marshall and others
were standing around awaiting develop
ments. The Inspector got Frank's two
arms over his shoulders and hoisted him
in the air. Then there was fun. Each
one of those captains produced a barrel
stave, and it is safe to say that Bragg got
at least one good one for every pound of
his avoirdupois before he managed to
wriccle to terra firma. Weights can still
be tested on the Folsom-street scales.
The State of California on the Portland
route will be laid up for one trip and the
Merico will take her place. The latter has
been newly refitted throughout and is now
one of the finest vessels in the fleet.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Orizaba left Mazatlan on the 18th inst.
and will be due here on the 25th inst. in
the morning. It will be the end of the
month before she gets away on her regu
lar trip. The company will send away
about August 10 a steamer to Alaska.
She will go via Puget Sound ports and will
carry nothing but coaloil, gunpowder and
other dangerous goods.
The steamer Zealandia sailed for Cen
tral American ports yesterday in com
mand of Captain F. W. Hart, late of the
Mariposa. She has taken the place of the

A QUESTION OF
KILLING COWS,
Milk Inspector Dockery Has
an Interesting After
noon.
HE ENLISTS THE POLICE.
Meat Inspector Davis Effects
a Flank Move
ment.
A HERD DRIVEN AWAY.
Dairymen Will Oppose the Killing
of Their Cattleâ Will Go
to Court.
Milk Inspector Dockery and Meat In
spector Davis had a field day yesterday.
With Veterinary Surgeon Neff they via
iled the Bwiss Alpine dairy for the pur-
po*e of killing off some forty cows that
had failed to Dass the tuberculine test, as
required by the United States law. They
met with such opposition on the part
of the proprietors of the dairy, Messrs.
Bauruann & Baumann, tliev were com
pelled to enlist the services of some police
man and three vaqueros to secure pos
session of the cows and drive them away
by the exercise of force and a clever ruse.
It will be remembered that the cows
were condemned some time ago, and al
though Inspector Dockery read them the
law in English and Davis translated it in
German the Baumanns. who are Swiss,
set up a claim that they did not
understand their riehts in the prem
ises. The law grants them the privi
lege of having a veterinary surgeon
present to repreÂ»ent their interests
during the examination. They did not
take advantage of t:.is, and tindine forty
of their cows condemned they made a pro
test which the Board of Health, however,
was inclined to disregard. The officers
wer^ ordered to go ahead with the kiiiing.
Dockery, however, wishing that they be
perfectly "satisfied, urged that unotuerjte^t
oe made for their benefit. The board,
however, could not give the matter the
time necessary within another two weeks,
and for the intervening time Dockery
insisted that the condemned cows be kept
in quarantine ana no part of their miik
used.
This was an expensive, proceeding for
Binmenn <Â£ Baumann, and they urged that
the test be made at once. Accompanied
I by Veterinary Surgeon Neff, the two in
spectors went to the dairy yesterday, aj
stated. Veterinary Surgeon EÂ».j;an repre
sented Baumann <fe Baumann. He decided
that it was not necessary to go through
with another test. It was agreed
that three cows be selected from the forty
and killed. If they were found rii?ease<i
then the whole lot should be condemned
and slaughtered. If they wore in good
health then another and very careful test
should oe made.
Dockery selected a cow. It was killed
by Davis. The lungs wgre given to tue
two surgeons and they were found to be
badly diseased. Then Baumann selected
a Holstein bull, 18 months old. It was
killed aqd found to be in an advanced state
of tuberculosis.
It was then that the Baumanns com
menced Â«o hght against their own agree
ment. They flatly declared that no more
of the cows should be killed. One of their
employes- took up a position near by with
an axâ chopping wood as an excuse Doek
ery believed, for having an ax in his hand.
The officers said the agreement had
been fairiy carried out on their part; the
cows had bean shown to be diseased and
they must be killed. The dairymen said
"no."
Dockery, Davis and the veterinary re
tired, and after dinner returned with three
po:icemen and three vaqueros. They were
met at tue fence by the dairymen aud
their employes, and the indications all
! pointed to a spirited encounter, for both
, Dockery and Davis said they would have
i the cows if other blood than that of dis
eased bovines had to be spilled.
However, it was not necessary. While
they were aiscussing the matter Davis
opened the gate, the vaqueros rode in.
drove the cows out of the inclosure before
they could be intercepted and took tnem
to Butchertown, where they now are.
They will all be slaughtered to-day.
The officers are very much incensed that
they should meet with such opposition in
the discharge ot their duty, especially, as
they say, after having given the firm more
j than the benefit of every right which the
I law allows.
This is the statement of the case as given
by the officers of the board.
On the other hand the dairymen declare
that the young T>ull killed was free from
any sign of disease, and tney declare they
will take the matter to court.
This conclusion was reached at an in
formal meeting of the Dairymen's Asso
ciation yesterday afternoon.
They believe that the health authorities
have exceeded their authority, and a test
case will be made by enjoining the officials
from slaughtering any more stock by way
of an experiment.
The views of the Dairymen's Associa
tion may be set forth by the remarks of
John D. Daly, who said last night: 'The
dairymen do not object to Mr. Dockery
condemning diseased milch cow* or
destroying impure milk. On the con
trary, every ri^ht-minded man in the
businessâ and I am safe in saying that the
men who have invested their money in
the dairy business are respectable citi
zens â are in favor of supplying their
customers with good pure milk.
"We are anxious and willing to haw our
herd examined by competent veterinary
surgeons, and when they find a cow or
cows suffering from tuberculosis to have
them separated from the healthy stock.
We do not want our healthy cows to be
come infected by unhealthy ones.
"But willing as we may be to have all
this done, we decidedly object to have our
stock killed â as we believe without due
process of law.
"Believing Mr. Dockery to be an honest,
fair-minded man, I still believe he has ex
ceeded his authority. We propose to test
this question in a court of justice."

GALLAGHER IS AFTER MITCHELL
Joe McAuiffe Will Try Farley's
Wonderful Discovery in the Hope
of Reducing Flesh.
The sporting fraternity cannot under
stand the "in andjout" system as recently ]
adopted by the Supervisors regarding box
ing permits.
During a recent meeting of the board, at
the suggestion of one of its members the
permit question waÃ referred back to the
Health and Police Committee for its re
consideration.
In discussing matters pugilistic last
evening at a favorite sporting resort a
prominent sport asked a wcil-known mem
ber of the Board of Supervisors for a little
information.
He desired to know what the Super
visors meant by granting certain clubs
permission to hold fistic contests during
certain specified months and then chang
ing their views at the meeting following.
The Supervisor smiled and gave some
evasive answer, which was interpreted by
<he sport as meaning that the City Fath
ers had far greater interest in boxing en-
tertainments than many people imagined,
and that, like Davy Crockett, their motto
was, first, be sure you're right, then go
ahead.
It is presumed that the Health and Po
lice Committee will pass on the permit
question definitely at its next meeting,
which will be on Friday.
Young Mitchell was notified yesterday
that Biily Gallagher, the pugilist who did
not give a satisfactory contest at the last
entertainment of the ciub, intended to
bring suit against Mitchell for money
which the fighter alleged was owing to
him. Mitchell appeared to be very uncon
cerned in the matter ami said in an off
handed way that if Gallagher or his attor
ney desired to enter suit against him or
the club he represents there was nothing
to bar them from proceeding.
"I paid Gallagher's training expenses,"
said Mitchell, "and according to the
agreement which he signed previous to
ihe exhibition, that was all and more in
fact that he was entitled to; but if he
wants to go to law very bad I shall not be
a stumbling olock in his way."
Gallagher says Mitchell did not treat
him righr in the premises and that his
attorney is very sanguine of winning the
Miit, otherwise 'he would not have any
thing to do with it.
It is said that Jeffres has started out on
the "pace that kills" and can be found at
any hour of day in saloons the proprietors
of which cater to the trade of the sporting
element
Peter Maher and his backer are waiting
and hoping for a good turn in the tide of
affairs pugilistic. Maher has still an idea
that the National Athletic Club will
smooth matters over with the City Fathers
and that permission will be granted to
Manager Groom to give just one more en
tertainment. Some members^)f the board
are very much opposed to the National
Club and it is doubtful if their old sores
will be healed in time to give Peter a
chance to return to New York with $6000
of California's gold coin.
Connolly, who is looking after the in
terests of the Irish pugilist, says that if
all fruit fails and the bij-money proposi
iion is shelved he will enter into an agree
ment with some of the enterprising tbe
atrical managers to have Maher spar a
limited number of rounds with some
local boxer, just to give the sporting
people of San Francisco an idea of how
Maher has improved within the past few
years.
Speaking of the Irishman's fight with
Fitz?immons, Connolly said:
"Maher Had all the best of the mill in
the first round, and had it not been for a
smash the New Zealander hit him in the
break-away from a clinch, Fitzsimmons
would certainly have left the ring a de
feated man.
"Maher was cautioned by the referee in
the first round against clinching, and he
endeavored to show the crowd that he did
not intend to take any mean advantage of
his opponent, and by so doing the New
Zealander took an unfair advantage of him
the first chance he got. and put it on to
the Irishman the moment he let go of
long Bob'a neck. I would give a good
deal if Peter had just one more chance at
the alleged heavy-weight champion, but
I'm satisfied that he will never again put
up his bis 'props' in front of the red
headed blacksmith."
The Occidental Club will match "Kid"
Lavigne to box either Everhardt or Charley
McKeever under its auspices, and negotia
tions are now pending between the club
and the lighters with that object in view.
Supervisor King is a warm friena of
Peter Maher and it is said that he will
try to induce Maher to accept of a purse
offered by the Occidental Club. Maher is
not on friendly terms with Young Mitchell
ever since the time the latter ruled against
him in a limited contest be engaged in
with big Joseph McAuKffe at the Grand
Opera-house.
Maher contends that he should have
had the decision, and tbe old sore against
Young Mitchell still remains open. But
all those little difficulties between fighters
and fight promoters can be adjusted nicely
by a little gentle persuasion, tempered
with a little softÃoap â that healing ma
terial which is so highly prized- by rich
and poor.
Big Joe McAuliffe has actually started
in to reduce flesh. Professor Farley says
that his boy can whip any raau who walks
under the sun and that two years from
now he will be the champion heavy
weight pngilist of the world.
"What surprises me most is that all those
big fellows who pretend to be great fighters
will have nothing to do with Joe," re
marked old Farley as he doffed bis ' 49 sun
ehade and ran his fingers through the
>'irsute covering of his pate.
"They will tell you," continued tbe pro
fessor, "that McAuliffe is a back number
and that be is too fat and all that kind of
talk, but you mark my word for it, if Joe
ever meets any of those blowbards he will
make them with that they never took up
fighting for a living.
"My boy is big and fat now, I must con
fess, but after he has taken a couple of
bottles of my wonderful discovery, he will
look entirely different to what be is how.
"Between my discovery and handball, I
promise you that Joe will enter the ring
against Slavin, or any one else for that
matter, in condition to iiybt for a man's
life. Just wait and see for yourself," and
the old professor ran like a deer to catch a
passing streetcar.

ILL USED AND IN EXILE,
Sad Plight of Santiago Corella,
a Fourteen- Year-Old
Boy.
Mrs. Estefana Garcia Accused of Maul
ing Him Wuenever She Got
the "Tantrums."
The sad case of Santiago Corella, noted !
in The Call some time ago, has once more j
been brought to public notice. Corella,
who is only 14 years of age, has been liv
ing, or rather existing, with an old woman
named Estefana Garcia, in a lodging-house '
at 323 Montgomery avenue. The woman
is said to be subject to "tantrums," during i
which she has been seen to beat the young
ster unmercifully with pots, pans, broom
sticks, or anything else that might come
handy.
Poor Santiago grew to fear these "tan- j
trums," and flee from them as from a
cyclone's path. Hence his humble bed on
a chest in the woman's room was often !
vacant, its tenant seeding repose In the j
dust-hole, the swill-bin; or in some friendly
closet or corner in the corridors. One of
the lodgers, taking pity on the boy's bad |
plight, offered him a share in his quarters
whenever Mrs. Garcia's interesting symp
toms might make their appearance, a
hospitality which Santiago gladly ac
cepted. , At the same time the man noti
fied Mrs. Garcia and her alleged husband
that in case matters did not mend the j
authorities would be notified.
Matters did not mend, and accordingly |
! the boy was taken in charge by the So- |
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren and placed in the Boys' Training
Home o:i Taylor street, while a warrant
was issued for the arrest of Mrs. Garcia on
a charge of cruelty.
"The case is a sad one," commented Sec
retary Welch â¢ yesterday. "It looks, as
though the boy Santiago had been ab
ducted from his home in Manzanillo by
Mrs. Garcia's late son, who was a sailor.
The captain on the steamer would have j
retained him in, his employ, as he had i
taken quite a fancy to the lad, but Garcia
insisted upon bringing him here. The lit
tle fellow has grown up in ignorance and
filth and is truly an object of charity. 1
intend requesting the Mexican Consul to
write to Manzanillo and Colima, wher^
Corella has relatives, asking them to send
means for his passage home. If returned
to the Garcia woman there is every reason
to fear that the poor little fellow, who is
not very bright, may become idiotic"

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1896.
MYSTERY OF A
FLOUR BARREL
Strange Story of a Fran
cisco-Street Small
Boy.
WAS MURDER INTENDED 1
Georgie WaJker Thinks That He
Has Narrowly Escaped
Death.
ONLY CHILDREN WERE PRESENT
These Young Witnesses Tell Very
Contradictory Stories of the
Affair.
Thomas Walker lives at 532 Francisco
street. He has children, grandchildren,
adopted children and visiting children
who climb around his knees, plunker-
plunk with his guitar, eat ginger-bread
elephants on his front steps and ride
around the block on h is wagon with him.
Mr. Walker is gray- haired and affable and
speaks Spanish. One of his neighbors is
W illiam Watts, who is middle-aged, gifted
with a lonn gray beard, a paternal smile
and ten children, who ranee in size from
the veriest toddler to the tall boy who is
big enough to have his outgrown clothes
cut over for his father. Tnese two house
hold?, opulent in babies, are liKe the rest
of Francisco street in that respect, for
there are battalions of babies in a house
and regiments of them in a single block.
Out of this plethora of young people j
comes a story which is more or less erew
| some, according to the degree of credit
which is attacbed to it. It has b?en
averred by Thomas Walker that an at- |
tempt has been made by Billy Watts, the '
! 21-year-old son of William Watt?, to dis
| pose of Georgie Walker, aged seven, in a I
: peculiarly atrocious and blood-curdling i
way. According to this averment, Billy j
Watts tied Georgie Walker's hands behind
him, tied a balerope around his legs,
bound a piece of coarse cloth over his
i mouth for a gag, put him in a flour barrel
and hammered the barrel-head in, all with
the intention of throwing the boy in the
! barrel overboard in the darkness of the
j night, and so murdering the lad.
William Watts puts in an alibi for Billy
I and shows that he was not at home at the
time that Georgie Walker was in a barrel.
Mr. Watts does not deny that Geonjie
was in a barrel, and does not attempt to
mitigate the circumstance that it was a
strong flour barrel, stout of stave and hoop
and new throughout. At about 5 o'clock
1 Monday afternoon Georgie Walker was |
| seen to emerge from a flour barrel in the 1
Watts family yard. This much is admitted, i
Beyond this statement there are no two j
children in the block who agree, so that
the facts in the case are puzzling and con
tradictory. When the alleged barreling
took place there were two children, a boy
and a girl, in the vicinity, and they were
the only spectators. These are members
of the Watts family, and they both
i solemnly assert tnat Georgie Walker got
! into the barrel himself to hide from bis
sister.
Two other children, a boy and a girl,
| little Louis CoutreraÂ«, aged 9, and Caila
Walker, aged 0, Allege that they saw
Georgie WalKer when he was tat en from
the barrel, and that he was gagged and
bound, and that blood oozed from his
mouth. There were no grown persons
who saw the occurrence; and as the chil
dren mentioned tell contradictory stories
on all points, it is difficult to ascertain
whether a tragedy was attempted or ii the
whole affair was a rough joke, or yet a
fabrication pure and simple. When
Georgie Walker returned to his parents he
was not bound. He is not very bright.
He is a SDare, blue-eyed boy, good hu
mored and playful. He says that he was
barreled up and that the head of the barrel
was in, but no one else saw the barrel
headed.
The odd feature of the case is the good
natared way in which all persons con
cerned regard the matter. Mr. Walker
says that there have been little contro
versies among the children and that the
Watts children have threatened to kill his
son Georgie. He never supposed that
they meant it, but he now thinks that they
did. He dirt not appear to be anxious
at all as be said this. Georgie Walker,
notwithstanding the alleged attempt on
his life by Billy Watts proposed yester
day in the presence of a reporter to go
over into the Watts' house once more.
One of the Watts children said naively
yesterday afternoon: "Georgie has not
been over to see me since he got out of the
barrel."
But for the complaint for battery which
Mr. Walker has filed before Judge Joach
imson the case would appear only a child's
story, but Mr. Walker seems to believe the
story fully and to be fully in earnest. The
neighbors are puzzled and so are the
police, because Mr. Walker is a good citi
zen and stands well with his neighbors.
Billy Watt denies that he saw the little
Walker boy Monday.

THE GRAND JURY
STANDS FIRM,
Will Search for Proof to
Indict Certain Super
visors.
ADVICE OF LAWYERS.
A Committee Will Confer With
the District Attorney
To-Day.
ALL THE JURORS IN LINE.
Utmost Power Dslegated to the Jury
to Be Exercised in the
Inquiry.
The Grand Jury at a meeting yesterday
afternoon resolved to lay aside all plans
for immediate adjournment and put forth
every effort in its power to expose the in
fluences which brought about the reduc
tion of the personal property assessment
roll by the Board of Supervisors. The
jury is convinced that certain Supervisors
acted as agents of interested corporations
in voting to reduce the assessments of the
Market-street Railway, the Spring Valley
Water Works and San Francisco Gaslight
Company.
The attendance of members at the ses
sion of the jury yesterday was large and
the proceedings were not marred by dis
putes and recriminations. It was stated
by several members that one point on
which the jury had always agreed was the j
principle thai the great corporations
should be compelled to sustain their share
of taxable burdens so that the whole
weight of taxation should not fall on the
merchants and home-owners.
The statement which the jury last week
presented to the Board of Supervisors, in
which it was shown -that there was a de
ficiency of $11,000,000 in the assessment of I
personal property, such as stocks, bonds i
and franchises owned by local corpora
tions, was submitted to the judgment of
all the members and was transmitted to
the board after due deliberation. It rep
resented the facts as the jury had ascer
tained by patient investigation. The con
duct of certain Supervisors in ignoring
this statement, and their further action in
reducing the assessment below the figures
reported by the Assessor, caused profound
deliberation. Individually the members
of the Grand Jury were indignant, but col
lectively they resolved to suppress all j
signs of indignation and proceed to ascer- I
tain what mysterious agency prompted j
the Supervisors to so openly declare them- !
selves the servants of interested corpora
tions.
Ie the determination to search for the
truth the voice of the Grand Jury was
unanimous. The decision to go ahead was
greeted with applause.
The jury had not been in session ten
minutes before Mr. Payne came out and I
called for District Attorney Barnes. It so j
happened that Mr. Barnes could not be '
present yesterday. It was resolved then |
to appoint Theodore F. Payne and Frank |
P. McLennan, the secretary, as a commit- !
tee to see Mr. Barnes to-day and ascertain j
definitely the scope of the Grand Jury's
authority and the character of evidence j
necessary to find indictment or accusation. I
Other counsel may be engaged to assist j
the District Attorney if that course should !
be deemed advisable. Further develop- j
ments in this line may be made at the
conference to-day. To-morrow at 2p. m.
| the Grand Jury will convene to receive
I the reports of the special committee and
discuss the advisability of engaging coun
sel.
The members of the jury refused to di
vulge the details of the discussion. The
foreman, Mr. Maskey, simply said, "We
do not intend to abandon this contest."
The secretary of the Grand Jury when
asked what course would be pursued said :
"You know that the question under con-
I sideration relates to the assessment of
property and the action thereon by the
Supervisors. We have not yet determined
what we shall do a or what we can do, but
we shall not stop'here. This seems at first
iike an impregnable fortress, and we have
not decided yet whether we shall attempt
to take it by storm or undermine it.
Nothing can be done unless we try. *In
the first place we shall lake the advice of
counsel. No, the jury is not divided in
sentiment on this question. Yes, we
considered the danger that the State Board
of Equalization will raise the San Fran
cisco valuation to make good the reduc
tions allowed by the Board of Supervisors.
I shall go with Mr. Payne to-monow to
wait on the District Attorney. We shall
ascertain what power the Grand Jury can
wield."
Alpheus Bull Jr. said: "We purpose to
keep hammering away and to hammer
when the iron is hot. We will see what a
Grand Jury can do."
The estimates for maintaining the mu
nicipal government for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1897, which have practi
cally been agreed upon by the Grand
j Jury, may not be transmitted to the
j Board of Supervisors. The work in hand
j will be finished, however, and embodied
; in the final report to Judge Slack.
Yesterday the proposed ellowance of
124,000 a year to janitors of the New City
i Uall called out an earnest protest. It was
j *aid that the protest would not be so
earnest if the building was kept in a state
of cleanliness creditable to the City, but
as a matter of fact it was kept in a
wretchedly filthy condition and was a
disgrace to San Francisco, although a
more than liberal allowance was made to
keep everything in first-class order.
County Clerk Curry did not go before
the Grand Jury yesterday. It is under-
I stood that the communication made to
j that body recently and published in The

Charles Anm*' Method of Reimbursing
Himself for Alleged Damage to

Louise Schwegler, now living at 1520
Clay street, swore out a search warrant in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday for the
recovery of her gold watch and chain,
which she alleges are in the unlawful pos
session of Charles Arms, tailor, 402 Jones
street. She also swore to a complaint
charging Arms with grand larceny.
The complainan-t says that she roomed
in Arms' house for about a year till June
3, when she was taken sick with typhoid
fever. Detective Anthony beard of her
case and took her to the French Christian
Union and through that society she was
sent to the French Hospital.
She recovered and left the hospital a few
days ago. She went to Arms' house to get
her effects and found that her trunk had
been broken open and her watch and
chain taken. She could get no satisfaction
from Arms and notified Detective
Anthony. Accompanied by Anthony she
returned to Arms' house and Arms ad
mitted taking the watch and chain because
Miss Schwegler's nurse had ruined his
carpets. He refused to fcive up the watch
and chain and referred the detective to
his attorney, John F. Riley, 426 California
street, who had the articles.
Attorney Riley is out of town so the
search warrant and warrant for grand
larceny were procured.
BLACKED HIS BABY'S EYE
Alexander Silva's Alleged
Cruelty to His Wife and
Child.
A Neighbor Scales a High Board
Fence and Gives the Han a
Sound Thrashing.
"Man's inhumanity to man" is a well
worn theme, but when it comes to heart
less cruelty to helpless little ones the most
degraded among human kind usually
shrink from crime so hideous and un
natural.
An exceotlon to this rule is found in the
case of Alexander Silva, a barber liv
ing at 634*4 Broadway. For some time
this man has been in the habit. of beating
and buffeting his eighteen-month old
child, which even now bears in a black
ened and swollen eye the evidences of a
father's brutality. A day or so ago Silva
was indulging in his favorite pastime
when the cries of the tortured child caused
Mrs. tsilva to interfere. The woman is in
an advanced stage of delicate health, but
regardless of her condition her husband
struck her in the face and felled her to the
ground.
Meanwhile the scene of domestic bliss
had been observed by a neighbor, Kltter
man by name, through a crack in the
bonrrt fence. When he saw Mrs. Silva
fall Kitterman. leaped over the high fence
separating his yard from that of the
Silvas, and, casting his jacket aside, pro
ceeded to thrash the innuman husband
and father to the Queen's own taste. Silva
came forth from the fray a very poor sec
ond best, Kitterman returned over the
fence to his own quarters, and Mrs. Silva,
having revived somewnat, proceeded to
dress the baby's wounds as best she could.
Kitterman forthwith reported the case
to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. Thus far no arrests
have been made, but the society is keep
ing Silva under rigorous surveillance.
Mrs. Silva has frequently been advised to
report her husband's conduct to the
proper authorities, but has always de
; sisted from doing so through fear of con
sequences. Silva is said to be a good pro
vider, and kind enough withal, save when
he giv.6B way to his ungovernable temper.
MALLON GOT THE PLUM.
| The Contract for the Art Glass for the
City Hall Dome Let.
'The Board of City Hall Commissioners
met yesterday and awarded the contract
' for the art glass for the dome to the Pacific
| American Decorative Company, of which
John Mallon, the veteran decorative glass
man, is the head. The price was $16,560.
The new specifications for the roof,
which call for a cement structure, instead
| ol the slate roof originally intended, were
| accepted. The cement roof will cost about
$50,000 less than the slate roof.
Embezzled the Money.
Mrs. Bertha Steinmiller, 2734 McAllister
J street, swore to a complaint in Judge Joachim-
I sen's court yesterday charging Mrs. Elizabeth
! Kopp with misdemeanor embezzlement. She
; alleges that she had $25 in the hands of At
> torney Loughborough and she gave Mrs. Kopp
I an order to secure the money. Mrs. Kopp ob
tained it and uicd it for her own uses and pur
! poses.

doorway of 38 Waverley place.
The facts in the case have at last come â 
to light despite highbinders, influential
merchants and threats of a dire end to
those who dared to breath a word of the
true facts. It is now seen that Lee Ti ;
met his death not because of the See Yup-
Sam Yup feud, but for stronger reasons i
and a personal enmity more deep-seated :
than that between two great organizations
could possibly be. i
Moreover, the fact is made manifest that
others are in danger of meeting the same i
dire end. and all on account of the malevo
lence and overmastering desire of one man
to be the local Chinese Czar. In this wrsh
he was abetted by two others whose names
are intimately commingled with his in the
plan that laid the unsuspecting Lee Ti be
neath tbe sod.
In the first place the companies in
volved are the Kung Chow, the wealthiest
and most influential of the Chinese Six
Companies, and the Bah On Tong, one of j
the highbinder societies which has been
responsible for much of the trouble the
police has had with the Chinese.
Lee Yip Dock is a member of the Kung j
Chow, and the Chinese assert that he is |
also a member of the Bah On Tong. Not
only that, but it is asserted with equal
positiveness that he is the leader, and !
really exercises far more authority than I
the president, who plays the role of figure- 1
head.
Now the Kung Chow is composed of i
four families, known as the Lee, Lum, j
Chin and Wong families. Each of these i
is allowed to name the president in turn.
Before the present ruler. Lee Lun Yung,
occupied the position it was filled by a
member of the Lum family. The last
time the Lee family had the naming of
the president.
The Lee lamily, however, is divided into I
two separate factions â one under the di
rection and governorship of Lee Mcc Toy,
the other under Lee Yip Dock. Lee Mee's
faction numbers about 1000 men, while
Lee Yip's support is limited to only fif- j
teen men. Astounding as it may seem, so
great is Lee Yip's generalship and shrewd
ness that he has managed with the aid of
the Bah On Tong to control nearly every
election occurring in the Kung Chow.
The Kung Chow Company has twelve!
directors, who are supposed to direct the j
policy of the body. The candidate put up !
by Lee Yip, whose name was Lee Lun I
Yuen, was elected as president by this
board, partly on account of Lee Yip's in- I
fluence presumably, partly because he was
regarded as a dangerous man to antago
nize on account of his known affiliation
with the Bah On Tong and partly because
the ex-Chinese Consul, Li Wing Yu, took
a hand and supported him.
Despite the strength of Lee Mcc Toy's |
faction he was entirely unable to with- |
stand the force of this unwarranted inter- *
ference of the Chinese Consul.
The bitterness caused by the election of
Lee Lun Ynen was still further increased
by another incident, which occurred only
two weeks ago.
Then the policeman ot the Knng Chow,
named Chin Look, died under peculiar
ctrcumstarlces. Lee Yip Dock came for
ward with a list of ten names, from which
he wished a new policeman to be chosen.
Every one of the men on the list was a
member of the Bah On Tong.
In accordance with the usual custom
Lee Mcc Toy brought forward the name of
one man, Lin Sum, who was formerly
interpreter for the Chinese Merchants'
Exchange, and very desirable on account
of his good knowledge of English and his
general reputation as a man of trustworthi
ness and integrity.
Lee Yip Dock at once made a great ado
and wanted the matter referred io his old
friend, the Chinese Consul, Li Wing Yu. I
Lee Mcc Toy vigorously objected to any
such proceeding. The matter, he said,
was of small importance, and even if it
were not the Chinese Consul had inter
meddled enough aireaay with their affairs.
In this stand Lee Mcc Toy was actively
re-enforced by all the members of the Lee I
family belonging to the Kung Chow Com
pany, who contended that the Lee family
only had the right to select the successor
of Chin Look.
The disinterestedness of Lee Mcc Toy is '
evident from the fact that Chin Look is
not a member of the Lee family, and
therefore could have been selected only on !
account of his peculiar qualifications.
An active rupture was precipitated by
some members of the Lee family accusing
Lee Mcc Toy of degrading the presidential
chair by favoring the motions of Lee Yip
Dock. The president rose up in his dig
nity and with wrathful mien asserted
that the matter should be referred to the
Consul, Li Wing Yu.
Several members of , the Bah On Tong,
who were present in the interest of Lee
Yip Dock, at once began a quarrel with
the friends of Lee Mcc Toy and ended by
beating several of them, one of whom,
named Lee Yin, was severely injured. It
broke the meeting up without permitting
any decisive measures as to a successor for
Chin Look.
A few days after the occurrence Lee
Gong, a relative of Lee Mcc Toy, met Lee
Yip Dock on Dupont street and asked
him why it was he did not sanctidn the
election of a successor to Chin Look with
out dragging the meddlesome Li Wing Yu
into the matter. Lee Yip's answer was a
torrent of abuse and a heavy blow.
Lee Gong necessarily was obliged to re
train Irom retaliation by the fact of his
abuser's age, gray hairs being an excuse
I for many sins according to the Chinese
I code of honor. To add to Lee Gong's
tribulations, the vindictive old highbinder
had him arrested for battery.
When Lee Mcc Toy and Joe Gar, a
wealthy liquor merchant, whose establish
ment is at 805 Sacramento street, heard of
they went down and bailed Lee Gong out.
Lee Yip's rage on hearing the news is
said to have been fearful. He put the Bah
j On Toner to work, saw the Chinese Consul
ana the twelve directors of the Kung
Chow and got them, in conjunction with
himself and LeeLun Yuen, to expel both
Lee Mcc Toy and Joe Gar from the Kung
Chow Company. They were also inter
dicted by Li Wing Yu, which shut them
off from all intercourse with the Six Com
panies.
The two men at once saw their friends
about the matter and expressed their in
dignation at the high-handed proceedings
of Lee Yip Dock, backed up by Li Wing
Yu, Lee Lun Y r uen and the Bah On Tong
hatchetmen.
When Lee Yip Dock heard of this he
at once issued a proclamation, so the
Chinese merchants assert, stating that $500
would be paid any man killing either Lea
Mcc Toy and Joe Gar, $400 for the death of
Charley Jung, one of their most faithful
friends, and $200 for the death of all the
nearest relatives and friends of any of the
three.
Lee Yip Dock i 3 treasurer of the Kung
Chow and is said to be able to lay hands
on the funds to use them as he pleases.
Lee Ti's death is directly due to the
price being set on the nead of any near
friend of the three men mentioned in the
foregoing. Ock Wah, the alleged mur
derer is not only a member of tne Bah
On Tong, but also of the On Yick Tong
and the Hop Sing Tong, all highbinder
societies.
His record is black as the raven's wing.
The Chinese openly assert that he is
responsible for at least three murders com
mitted in late years.
A Chinese named Jow Yook stood on the
second floor of a building directly ODPOsite
35 Waverley place and peering through
the window saw the assassin get in his
deadly work and Lee Ti drop in the death
agony.
So far he will not state whether it was
Ock Wah or not. This reluctance is due
to his fear of the hatchetmen, bo nobly
controlled by Lee Yip Duck.
Charley Jung, residing at 727 Sacra
mento street, who was reported in a morn
ing paper to have identified Ock Wah as
the slayer, vigorously denies the allega
tion and asserts that he did not see the
shooting at all.
Chinese highbinders are now out search
ing for an opportunity to kill some friend
of Lee Mcc Toy, Joe Gar and Charley
Jung. Joe Gar has two men hired to
protect him in his place of business.
Sergeant Cook and posse were last night
detailed to patrol Chinatown and keep
things as quiet as possible.
The names of three of the highbinders
engaged in seeking blood money are
known. They are Low Kuen, Lin Fook
and Muck Ning. The Chinese hope for no
relief until the triumvirate composed of
Lee Yip Dock, Lee Lun Yuen and Li
Wing Yu is dissolved by some process or
other.
'CANNOT HEAR OR SPEAK,
Strange Effect of a Blow Upon
James Maddens
Head.
He Was Struck With a Billiard Cue,
Causing a Hemorrhage and Tem
porary Paralysis.
James Madden received a blow last
night that has temporarily at leas/ de
prived him of both speech and hearing.
He was playing bagatelle in a saloon at
606 Howard street when he had an alter
cation with John J. Drisooll, the bar
keeper. Driscoll picked up a billiard cue
and struck Madden a blow on the left side
of tbe head knocking him down. He was
in such a dazed condition that Driscoll i
and others, who were ;in the saloon, be- j
came alarmed and sent him to the Receiv- !
ing Hospital in a hack.
Dr. Fitzgibbon found a alight abrasion
on tbe left side of the head, but that was
all. To all questions put by the doctor
and Steward ilogan Madden simply stared .
at them. Finally questions were "written ,
on a piece of paper and Madden wrote that j
he could neither hear nor speak. He wrote
that tbe man who struck him with the cue .
was Driscoll, the barkeeper; that he i
wanted to see his brother Patrick Madden,
who lives at 962 Minna street, and that he
felt great pain on the left side of his head.
Dr. Fitzgibbon says the case is a most
interesting one, ant! he will closely watch
for developments. He thinks the blow
from the cup has caused a hemorrhage and
a clot of blood has formed which is press
ing on the center of speech and also aftect
ing the auditory nerves. If Madden does
not regain his speech by this morning an
operation will probably be performed to !
remove the clot of blood.
The doctor notified the police of Mad
dens condition and Driscoll will likely be
arrested. .

in regard to the matter between Federal
and State authorities.
A communication was received from Al
bert Carlisle of Berkeley in regard to the
use of carrier-pigeons between this port

OVER A MILE A MINUTE.
John Filmer's Homing Pigeons
Break All Previous
Records.
Birds Are Less Than Four Months Old.
Will Fly From Los Gatos During
"City Guard" Encampment.
John Filmer's homing pigeon loft now
contains two record breakers.
On Sunday the 19th Inst. at 10:10 a. m.
two of his youngest homing pigeons were
flown from a spot four miles south of Red
wood to their loft in this City, making the
loft at 10:43 o'clock. By airline this distance
is fully 35 miles, and the time was a close
thirty-three minutes.
What is most remarkable about this
homing event is the fact that both of these
pigeons were le?? than four mont'is old.
They were first flown from Belmont and
made the distance in about an hour. That
was three days previous to the Redwood
City fly.
John Filmer is still an amateur in the
homing pigeon business, but he has cer
tainly shown considerable tact in raising
them. He aspires to longer distances and
quicjeer time, but it will be hard to beat
the record these two squabs, for they are
not much more, have made â thirty-five
miles in thirty-three minutes. The actual
flying speed was 1866% yards per minute;
the record has never reached that, the best
being at an average of 1767 yar^s per min
ute.
t Kilmer is justly proud of his birds. In
order to train them more thoroughly he
intends to fly them from Los Gatos during
the encampment there of "The Old City
Guard," Company B, First Regiment In
fantry, which begins on Sunday, August
16.
George a. Croley, the well-known bird
fancier and authority on homing pigeons,
says that this is the best he has ever heard
of on the Pacific Coast Fourteen hun
dred yards a minute is excellent time and
the fact that these birds made so much
more was surely due to most favorable
.conditions.. * -

ported that nine-tenths of the space of the
fall exposition waa already taken and that
the committee on exhibits was anxious to

FIDO ROUTS A BURGLAR,
House-Breaker on Eddy Street
Foiled by a Faithful
Dog.
Daring Attempt to Cut a Way Into
a Saloon in a Prominent
Location.
A burglar, with more than the ordinary
amount of nerve, attempted to break into
the saloon of J. W. Myser, at 33 Eddy
street, during the early morning hours of
yesterday. *
This attempt was all the more daring
when there is taken into consideration the
prominent location of the place and the
frequent travel on that part of Eddy street,
between Powell and Mason. Moreover,
the house is directly opposite the Tivoli,
where a special officer is supposed to be
on duty the whole night, in addition to
the regular patrolman.
The evil intentions of the burglar were
frustrated by the watchfulness of a favor
ite dog, kept by the proprietor of the sa
loon. The dog, on hearing the noise,
commenced to bark. This no doubt fright
ened off tbe burglar. The proprietor dis
covered, on coming down stairs from his
bedroom, that a large pane of glass in one
half of the front door had been broken
into fragments, thereby removing all ob
stacles by which an entry could be made
into the front part of the saloon entrance.
Either the noise of the broken glass or
an attempt to force a wooden partition
out of place had evidently attracted the
attention of the dog. At all events evi
dence of the early morning visit of the
burglar was manifest in the marks of his
handiwork on the glass door. â¢
The attempted . entry was apparently
made between the hours of 3 and 5 o'clock
in. the t morning, as the saloon was kept
open until the former hour.
Captain Lees was notified and the police
are on the lookout for the would-be thief.

GRAVED DEATH

PUT OUT A FOREST TIRE.
Superintendent Smiley Caught in
the Flames, but They
Rescued Him.
SAVED VALUABLE PROPERTY.
The Lads Worked for Eleven Hours
at a Stretch and Never Once
Flinched.
Arthur G. Smiley, superintendent of the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, is proud of
his trust. The lads under his care have
shown themselves to be little heroes in
Boys From the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society Patting Out a Forest Fire Near
Cazadero. Their Teacher Was Surrounded by Flames, but the Youngsters
Fought Their Way to Him and Cleared a I athway With Their Wet Sacks.
They Worked Incessantly for fcleven Hours and Never Once Flinched.
the hour of danger, and now the campers
around Cazadero cannot say too much in
their praise.
Unaided, the boys put out a forest fire,
and without a thought of their own peril
rushed through the flames that sur
rounded their master and carried him to a
place of safety. From 2p. m. until la. m.
they worked unceasingly, and saved thou
sands of dollars' worth of property be
longing to the Duncan Mills' Redwood
Company and the Montgomery estate.
After the fire was put out some of the
giant redwoods burned for three days, but
the boyÃ kept watch and ward over them,
in order to prevent another outbreak.
About three weeks ago Superintendent
Smiley started from San Francisco with
over 100 boys for the annual outing. They
pitched their tents in Elim Grove, near
Cazadero, and settled down to a month of
genuine outdoor enjoyment. Certain
rules were laid down and they were obeyed
in every instance. On the 15th inÂ«t. Mr.
Smiley left the camp in charge of his
deputies and started ior San Francisco.
He transacted his business here and
started back for Cazadero. On his arrival
the fire was in progress and no one seemed
to know what to do. The flames were
running through the undergrowth like
wildfire and the camp was threatened.
It did not take Superintendent Bmiley
long to get the boys to wok, and work they
did. They grabbed up the sacks in which
they had brought up their clothes and I
wetting them in the creek began to thrash j
out the fire. A string of lads passed tbe
bags to and from tbe water, and so from
hour to hour the fight went on.
Mr. Smiley was here, there and every
where, directing the work, but once he ebt
too far, and in a moment he was in a circle
of flame. The boys saw his danger, and in
a moment there was a rush from all direc
tions, and a pathway through the flames
was beaten clear for the superintendent.
It was several minutes before he recov
ered, and then after a glass of water he
went at it again and cheered on the boys
to further exertion by his example.
Niar to where the fire broke out there
was an enormous quantity of tanbark
stored. This the boys determined to save,
and finally, alter eleven hours of contmu- j
Otis work, they succeeded, it was a job
that would have tired out the most expert
fireman in San Francisco. So it is no
wonder the/ boys slept late and long the
next day. TOuruit' the battle every one of
them caught poison oak, and Superinten
dent Smiley is now doctoring them for the
troublesome compinint.
George M. S. Dryiien, wharfinger at
Main-street wharf, spent two weeks
among the redwoods near Cazadero and
\va- at Elm Grove when the society boys
were putting out the fire. "I never saw
bravei lmle fellows in all my life," said
he yesterday. "Why, when they made
that rusu through the Hames "to save
their master it seemed to me as if the j
charge of the Light Brigade wasn't in it
with them. Not one flinched and it seemed
to me as ii it was a question as to which
boy could get nearest to the flames and j
not get actually roasted. They must have '
saved at least $40,000 worth of property !
and all mat Mr. Smiley had io say was, ,
'We were afraid they might, say it was the i
boys who set it ahre. In any e*ent we
couldn't have done less than we did.'
"I never saw boys as fond of their mas- j
ter as those boys are- He has his own ,
two sons with him, and I defy anybody to J |
show one particle of difference between ]
his treatment of his own fl-sh an blood
ami the wai.s and stray- committed to his
charge. 1 never in ail my life saw a better i
object lesson than those motherless and 1 1
fatherless children braving the flames to
save their teacher.
"When the fire was out and all danger
was over they went to work and removed
all the burning logs from the railroad
track and thus prevented a probable dis
aster. Afler that they went to sleep ana
slept the sleep of exhaustion."

Hopkins Institute of Art, the rector,
wardens and vestry of Grace Church, and
Hugo H. Toland to the opposition of Wil
liam Gridley Toland to the probate of the
will of Mary B. Toland, as filed yester
day.
The answer denies that Mary B. Toland
died interstate, end the contestant's claim,
as the son of Charles Gridley Toland, is
disputed, except as to $2000. In fact, the
entire contents of the opposition filed are
denied, including the averments as to the
sanity of tbe testatrix.
For a further and separate answer to the
opposition, it is urged that after the de
murrer to the original contest was sus
tained on May 29, 1896, the contestants
were given time to amend their opposi
tion, which lime was on several occasions
extended up to June 19, 1896, but no fur
ther; and that the contestants did not
amend their opposition before that time.
It is therefore prayed that the docu
ment hied by Hugo U. Toland as the last
will and testament of Mary 8. Toiaud be
admitted to probate.

HOME INDUSTRY CAUSE,
Julian Sonntag President of
the Manufacturers'
Association.
The Code Commissioners to Be Asked
to Alter the L:w Aff cting
Drummers' Licenses.
The directors of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association met yesterday.
The rules of the association were sus
pended in order to accept the resignation
of Horace Davis, the president. Mr. Davis
stated that his private business prevents
him from fulfilling his obiigatious to the
oreamzation, particularly in the capacity
of its president.
Julian Sonntag was elected as a member
of the board of directors, and immediately
after was elected to the presidency of the
association.
Manager Tacy made a report upon the
progress of the coming home industry
fair, which will open in September under
the management of the Mechanics' Insti
j tute and the Manufacturers' and Fro
] ducers' Association. He urged that the
j latter body have a special booth where in
formation concerning home products could
be obtained, and where pledges to patron
ize only home manufacturers could be
registered. He was instructed to make ar
rangements for Buch a booth.
Mr. Tacy suggested that the trademark
be changed, and he submitted a design ob
long in shape with the word "California"
and the letters "H. I." for home industry
in the center. His idea was that the pres
ent trademark, while vtry pretty on
paper, would blur if stamped or stenciled
on wood or gunny sacks. The directors de
cided not to make any change at present.
A subject that nas caused the manufac
turers considerable annoyance was brought
tip and (li-scussed by Mr.'Keller. In many
I of the interior towns a special tax or
license is levied upon all traveling sales
men from local houses, but the drummers
from abroad are exempt by United States
laws, which prohibit special legislation
against coods from o*her States or inter
feres with the sale thereof. Mr. Keller
introduced the following resolution, which
was adopted, and the secretary was in
structed to present the matter to the Code
Commission:
Whereas, The attention of this board has
been called to the fact that in many cities of
the State of California a license is required
from commercial travelers from other cities of
the Sate; and, whereas, the taxing ol such
licensj- against said, traveling nalfsmen works
an unjust di-critnination against the traveling
salesmen of this State who may be selling Ca'i
fornia-manufactured goods and In tavor ot the
traveling salesmen of other States, arid even of
those of this State who are selling Eastern or
foreign-made articles, though delivered from
California agencies, as the two latter classes
are noi subjected to such taxation; and,
whereas, it is the sense of this board that an
act should be passed by the Legislature of the
State of California pronibi ting the levyniK of
the aforesaid unjust license; be it therefore
Resolved. That this association, through its
proper officials, request the Commission for
thi- Correction and Revision of the Laws of
tliis <*tate to include in its report to the Legis
lature su<h legislation as may be necessary to
remedy the above state of affairs.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1896.
WILL ORGANIZE

Big Central Club Started
at the Union
League.
PURE POLITICS ONLY.
First Step Taken in the Forma
tion of a Powerful
Body.
LAID OTJT ON BROAD LINES.
A Cub Whose Members Are Not
Working for Spoils, but
for McKinley.
At the Union League Club rooms in the
Palace last night a large number of the
foremost business and professional men
of the City, all staunch Republicans, met
to arrange plans for the organization of a
general Republican League to work for the
success of the Republican party which will
not interfere with local affairs and be non
antagonistic to the several local cluba al
ready organized.
Dan T. Cole acted as temporary chair
man.
A communication was read from Arthur
W. Kinney of Los Ancreles, president of
the California State Republican League,
outlining the plans of that organization.
Colonel Stone was of the opinion that
an organization should be formed to
affiliate with the National League.
"If tkis is to be a league club," said
Tirey L. Ford, "it must be organized
along league lines. If a campaign club, it
must be made such that it will aid the
National fight. 1 Delieve such an
organization is needed in this City.
There should be some great
central organization which will aid
in securing the McKinley election. I be
lieve this City will go Republican. There
is no question about this whatever, and if
we can form a club made up from all the
walks of life, of men of uprightness, and
not men seeking for office, it will
prove a great weight in determining
the next President. If the league club is
formed on these lines I am sure it will be
a great success."
Thomas H. Rush, prominent in organiz
ing the present movement, read a long list
of names of business and professional men
eager to join the proposed organization.
Among th m are:
Judge J. A. Warm ire, James H. Gatet. J. H.
Sooer, B. Cromweil, Eugene F. Best, Colonel
Charles Sonntag, A. E. Castle, Dan T. Cole;
T. C. Masteller, department commander

for a Republican club that will not be an
tagonistic to any local issues. The follow
ing gentlemen were appoinied by the
chairman: Colonel Stone, Tirey L.Ford
Judee Dibble. T. C. Masteller and Thomas
H Rush.
This committee will meet on Sunday
afternoon and ascertain the details more
fully as to what is required in the forma
tion of the club, and will report their
views on Wednesday night a week tunce
to the large gathering of Republicans that
will convene in the Union League rooms
to complete the organization of the pro
posed club.
The following letter was sent to Presi
dent Kinney of the State League:
At a meeting of representative Republicans
held in the Union League Club roomi this
evening a committee was appointed to formu
late the j)l an for a large central chib in this
City. We would like all Information and data
concerning the organization of the league
clubs which you might be ab e to cive uÂ», no
that we may submit a proposition to an ad
journed meeting which will be held within a
:ew days with a view to making our organ
ization & National League Club.
Colonel Stone said: "All the clubs so
far formed are for local control. We want
a far-reaching National clvb â a club
whose members are not working for spoils
but for McKinley ; a club that will conduct
a vigorous and successful campaign."
Swallowed /Arsenic.
Holm M. Cox, a miner about 60 yean of age
living at 2226 Howard street, swallowed a dose
of arsenic last night. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital and Dr. Fitzgibbon suc
cessfully aUmiuifcteied the usual remedies.
Cox s wife and child have been in the country
lor a few days and he has availed himself of
the opportunity to dally with the flowing bowl
which destroyed his appetite. He had not

THE LABOR UNIONS.
Woodworker* 1 avor Recognizing the
Shiuglerg' Bodyâ Tbe harbÂ«ra.
The Woodworkers' Union met last even
ing and instructed its delegates. to the
Building Trades Council to vote for the
admission of the delegates of the Shinglers'
Union into the council. A report was re
ceived that the new mill at 568 Brannan
street is compelling its workmen to labor
ten hours instead of nine. The attention
of the Building Trades Council will be
called to the matter with the view of mak
in M * fi iÂ§ ht for a reduction of hours in the
mill. The union indorsed the American
a eberation of Labor in its boycott on the
product of Kreos, Wertheim & Bhiffer's
?lga v fa ,?, tor y of New York - At the bi X fire
in the West Coast furtiture factory many
of the workmen lost their tools. The in
surance feature of the union last night
paid toese men $247 on the policies they
held.
The Journeymen Barbers' Union last
evening started in its crusade against
keeping the shops open after 8 o'clock at
night, and a strong committee was ap
appointed to aeitate the question. Already
many of the bosses have agreed to close at
8 and are urging their men to join the
union. C. H. Spencer was appointed to
represent the union at the National Con
vention of Barbers, which will take place
in Minneapolis in October. The union
resolved to renew its fight against 5-cent
shÂ«ps, coilegp barbers and female barbers.
After the regular business was over'the
members spent the rest of the evening in
a sort of hign jinks, in which songs, reci
tations and refreshments formed the prin
cipal features.
NEMOT O STARTS SOUTH,
He Takes San Diego's Reported
Laod Bonus With a
Grain of Sait
Was an Oakland Schoolboy and Grad
uatfd From the University
of Vermont.
San Diego is waiting to welcome tbe
man whose leport to the Japanese Govern
ment may result in great commercial ad
vantage to that city.
Sho Nemoto. the special commissioner
sent by the Japanese Government to study
the commercial prospects of the Pacific
Coast of Mexico, Central America and
South America, will start from here this
morning for San Diego in company with
T. Kusafeado, who arrived with him Sun
day from Japan and whose mission is to
consummate the purchase from the Mexi
can Government of 300.C00 acres of land
in the 9tate of Chapas for the Japanese
Colonization Society.
As stated lo The Call last Monday Mr.
Nemoto's investigations, while primarily
to learn commercial prospects and report
them to his Government, are ultimately
of much importance in connection with
several prospective steamship lines
that are to branch out from Japan
and touch at many ports to the south of
here. One of the lines may make San
Diego a terminus, in order to ga'her from
tnat port a large amount of goods brought
by rail directly from the East for the Jap
anese markets, notably cotton, kerosene
and machinery.
Mr. Nemott) returned to tbe Occidental
last night Irom a visit to San Jose.
"What do think," hf wan asked, "of
San Diego's offer of a bits subsidy of land
to tbe Japanese steamship line that shall
touch at that port?"
"Will give a tract of land? Yes, that's,
what I hear, but i take some things with
a grain of salt," replied the shrewd little
com niissi oner.
"I came to this country first," he said,
in reply to a question, "in '79, am! at first
studied in the public schools of Oakland.
In '85 I was graduated from Hopkins'
Academy near Oakland. Then I went
East and entered the University of Ver
mont, from which I was ertwiuated in '89.
"I afterward went to Europe, on my
way home, and saw the Paris Exposition,
and visited Berlin, Rome, EgyDtand India.
"In 1893 I was appointed Commissioner
of the Mexican colonization investigation,
and I went to the fair at Chicaeo. On
nay return to Japan in March, 1894. I was
appointed by tlie Government to investi
gate the products and the climate of Sao I
Paulo, Brazil; the West Indies and Cen- j
tral America. Sao Paulo is a very good I
countryâ more like California than any of
the other Spanish countries.
"After spending a day and a half in San
DKgo we wiil go to Mexico. We shall be
there two months and about two months
on the coast of Central America and

in November, as I want to get back home
this year.

JIMENEZ SCORES A
BLOODLESS VICTORY
The Charge of Assault
Against Him Dis
missed.
EZETA WISHED IT DONE.
Says He Has No Animosity and
Does Not Expect Further
Trouble.
HIS HONOR'S SEARCH FOR GUNS
Judge Campbell Takes Precautions
Against an Outbreak Before
the Judicial Presence.
Ezeta has offered the pipe of peace to
Judge Campbell and Pedro Jimenez, and
the prosecution of the fiery Spaniard
whose weapons of warfare included re-
Paul Jimenez, Who Spat at Carlos Ezeta, ex-Prcs.dent of Salvador
volvers and saliva has lapsed. The prose
cution, both special and regular, moved
to dismiss tbe charge of assault with a
deadly weapon against Jimenez, and in
accordance with this motion Judge Camp
bell struck the case from his calendar.
It was expected that the narrow con
fines of Judge Campbell's courtroom would
before evening btcume the scene of more
Salvadoran trouble, more revolver drawing
and Spanish expletives, but Judge Camp
bell removed all possibility of the pres
ence of artillery by having Jimenez
searched before tue case was called.
Ezeta was not there. Instead his attor
ney, R. E. Ragland, came with a motion to
dismiss all charges on the ground of the
youth and inexperience of the defendant.
Jimenez was present, surrounded by a
goodly number of witnesses and with
Judge Sullivan to represent him. He was
eager for an investigation. He wanted
his Honor to delve deep into the muddle
of Spanish and English, the drawing of
pistols, the spitting in faces and the whole
Salvadoran trouble, but his Honor waxed
wise in his day and proposed to simplify
matters by granting the motion of the
prosecution and dismissing the case.
No sooner had the case b_en calied than
Mr. Ragland proffered iorgiveness on the
part of fhe general and moved to dismiss.
He had consulted Mr. Forbes, the prose
cuting attorney, he said, and that official
had agreed that the charge of assault with
a deadly weapon should be dismissed.
He said Ezeta had no animosity against
Jimenez. Jimenez, he said, might have
had some imaginary wrongs; he might
have thought that Ezeta had harmed him,
but Ezeta was willing to overlook that,
and he would not prosecute his assailant.
He was willing to pardon Jimenez so far
as he was concerned. He felt he was safe
from any further attack.
But Judge Sullivan aid not see it in that
light. Judge Sullivan said he had the de
fendant and all his witnesses present, all
realy and willing to testify, and he
wanted a full investigation. He said he
couid prove that when Jimenezfdrew his
pistol it was only after he had finished his
salivary assault, and because he was
afrai<l Ezeta might come into battery and
turn loose a few budets himself. That
Jimenez was justified in his assault Judge
Sullivan offered to prove beyond douot,
but any way he wanted to know who
wanted this matter dismissedâ whether it
was Mr. Ragland, special prosecuting
counsel, or Mr. Forbes, the reeular official.
Here Judge Campbell took a hand and
said that Mr. Ragland had consulted with
Mr. Forbes and it was with Forbes' con
sent that the motion was made.
Once more Judge Sullivan addressed the
court. He said Jimenez was satisfied.
He had had his revenge, and he wanted
nothing more than to vindicate himself
He bad witnesses galore and he would
like to have them heardâ he would like to
prove everything, but Judge Campbell
was not to be roped into any controversy,
so he ordered the case dismissed.
Jimenez was not allowed to go without
a little counsel. He was told by the court
that, while he might draw pistols and
spit in all the faces in San Salvador, still
it was not recognized as a legitimate
pastime here and the sooner the defendant
recognized that fact the better. His
Honor said he would have no more of itâ
a statement which remains to be verified.
Robbery Charge Dismissed.
The charge of robbery against G. A. Donahue
and Joseph Twyett was dismissed by Judge
Low yesterday. The evidence Bhowed that
John Smith, the complaining witness, bad
been acting indecently in Tracey's saloon on
Eighth street, which led Donahue and Twyett
to take him to the City Prison. Smith tiad
given Twyett his nickel watch and cigar-cut
ter, but he was so drunic that he forgot all
about v.
A NEW CAR-FENDER.
An Invention by N\ D. Sickels That Is
Very Ingeniona.
N. D. Sickels of this City has recently
invented and patented a streetcar fender.
It has been pronounced by several railroad
men and master mecliauics to be of great
merit. Its construction and action is by
means of coil-springs carried in pipes
about six or eight inches from the pave
ment and the car track. These springs are
kept constantly compressed, with a pres- j
sure toward the front against a trigger
board, which is carrit?d about one foot in
advance and covet&.the entire front of the
car to a height of aDout four feet.
This trigger is very simply arranged, so
that if pressed against by even a small child
it automatically tips buck and forms a
flexible bed for the victim to strike against
and at same time loosens the catch
which holds the coil spring back, so that
the body shoots down to the track and out
ward, carrying a strong canvas apron.

The action of throwing tue apron out is
so quick that a person's feet are
knocked from tinder by a soft rubber hose
and the apron is stretched ready to catch
and carry the body along until the car
can bf stopped. Inasmuch as this device
is attaoLed to the immediate front and
under the steps outside of the wheels it
does pot interfere with the machinery or
running gear and so can be easily put on
any car. It has the advantage of working
automatically, and still can be sprung or
controlled by a slignt touch of a string by
the motorman. It is arranged so as not
to work when coming in contact with
j vehicles.

Unsuccessful Sale of Seats
for the Carnival
Benefit.
BOXES NOT IN DEMAND.
Maxine Elliott's Bewitching
Smiles Fail to Move
the Crowd.
COLONEL O'BYBNE'S VAIN PLEA
An Impassioned but Unavailing Ap
peal to the Chivalry of the
Crowd.
The announcement that Miss Maxine
Elliott would act as auctioneer at the sale
of seats yesterday for the benefit perform
ance to be given at the Columbia Theater
MAXINE ELLIOTT IN THE ROLE OF AUCTIONEER AT THE MERCHANTS* EXCHANGE.
this evening in aid of the Golden Gate
Carnival fund attracted a Crowd of curi
osity seekers to the Merchants' Exchange.
Long before the bidding was started an
expectant throng jostled and tip-toed to
catch a glimpse of the dashing brunette
who was to knock the seats and boxes
flown tojthe expected bidders.
Inside the partition rail in the corner of
the hall quite a little group of theatrical
people had gathered. Manager Fried
lander of the Columbia bustled ai>out an
swering questions and giving directions,
and for a short time Frederick Warde anrt
L. R. Stockwell stopped to watch the sale.
Miss Maxine Elliott, the heroine of the
occasion, basked with her sister Gertrude
in the genial sunshine of Colonel
O "Byrne's gailant smiles.
When Miss Elliott had mounted a chair
and coquettisnly called for bids it was
evident that the crowd had come to ad
mire, but hot to buy. Box A went quicKly
to Hugo D. Keil of Goldberg, Bowen &
Co. for $25, and box B was knocked down
to J. P. LÂ« Count for $20.
Then the bidding btopped. The fair
auctioneer inquired vainly for "what am 1
offered?" In the halls of 'Change she
experienced what divers of her histrionic
predecessors bad experienced behind the
lootlights in this City â "a dead cold
frost. Not a bid could ahe get for box C,
the next on the list.
This was more than the chivalrous
Colonel O'Byrne could stand. "I am sur
priÂ»ed," he declared, 'that you gentlemen
do not Did up. The cause which this sale
is to aid is certainly one that sbould enlist
your support, and besides we have brought
one of the most beautiful women in the
land to act as the fair auctioneer, and yet
you are not chivalrous enougu to make 'an
offer.
"Now, do try again," coaxed the gallant
colonel, turning toward Miss Elliott, who
had taken her seat. "I am sure these gen
tlemen will bid now."
'No. thank you, colonel," naively re
sponded tbe vivacious brunette, "I waive
my right In your iavor. :i
George H. Davis was recoenized in the
crowd, and, being an experienced auc
tioneer, was called on to proceed with the
sale. He gracefully accepted the task, or
rather the "pleasure," as he termed it, and
continued the unpromising quest of bids.
General Warfield's bid of $15 for box C
was accepted, and after vainly calling for
a bid on box D Auctioneer Davis wanted
to Know what be was offered for a choice
of the loges or the seats in tbe house. J.
S. Dinkelspiel took two seats at $2 50
apiece and Auctioneer Davis took three
more at $1 each. The vaiu appeal for bids
then ceased, the auctioneer declaring that
it was the worst sale that he had ever
seen in his Jife.
The remaining seats and loges will be on
sale at the Columbia box-office at regular
rates up to the beginning of this after
noon's performance.
MERCHANTS SCORED.
The Press Ajrent of the Carnival
Issues a Criticism of The V. ,
Association's Action. .
The following report of yesterday's
transactions in regard to the proposed
carnival was issued by the official press
agent:
The members of the executive committee of
the Carnival of the Golden Gate started out on
their tour of canvassing yesterday. Up to the
close of business in the afternoon partial re
ports only bad been received at headquarters
from a lew of tha comaiuee. Several members â 
I
I of the committee reported to General Warfleld
j that the members of the Merchants' Associa
| tion were very slow in : encouraging the carni-
I val while the wholesale merchants, on the
j contrary, were enthusiastic in its support.

said one of the executive committee last night.

penuriousness manifested by the crowd at the

sale of seats has already taken place. The
committee is salaried that the benefit at the

i The canvass will be continued throughout
the City this morning. Financial Secretary
Boldernann reported last night that those
members of the canvassing. committee whom
he had seen were not at all discouraged at the
outlook, but proposed to start in with renewed
vigor this morning.

of nitric acid, not sufficient, however, to
produce instant death. i)rs. Knorp and
Dodel were called in ana succeeded in
rendering temporary relief. The age of
the suicide, however, was against any per
manent cure, death finally coming yes
terday morniug at 5 o'clock.

He left a wife and four children, all the

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1896.
OR, CHALMERS
AFTER SMALLPOX
Hunting a Case Supposed to
Have Come on the
China.
A COOL RECEPTION.
Dr. Rosenau Will Not Allow
Him to See a Quarantine
Patient.
ONLY A CASE OF VARIOLOID.
Nevertheless the Local Health Officer
Will Allow No One to Land
for Fourteen Days.
The question that is now agitating the
minds of tbe dual State and Federal quar
antine officers of this port is, "Did the Pa
cific Mail steamship China, which arrived
Sunday from Asia, bring in smallpox?"
Dr. Chalmers, the State medical officer,
was notified yesterday that there were
two cases among the Chinese steer
age passengers now quartered on An
gel Island, and Dr. Rosenau, the
marine surgeon at that station, declares
that there is only one case of varioioid
among his Asialic boarders. When doc
tors disagree, etc.
But another complication entangles the
case. Last night State Quarantine Officer
Chalmers called away his tug and steamed
over to Angel Island. He beard that small
pox had broken out among the detained
China passengers on the| island, and he
wished to learn the truth of the matter.
The official visitor ran the gauntlet of the
blue-coated guards at tno landing And was
escorted up to the quarters of Dr. Rose
nau, then in charge of the station. After
half an hours wait the doctor received
his visitor, and in answer to a question
stated that there was one case of varioioid
among the Chinese passengers. Dr.
Chalmers asked if he might see the
patient and was flatly refused the privi
lege.
The State officer was stiffly escorted
back to his tug and bowed curtly off the
island. So the question is, "Has Angel
Island a case of smallpox, and why did
the Government medical officer refuse to
permit tbe State medical officer to visit the
patient?"
When the China sailed from Hongkong
she had over 500 Chinese aboard. Of these
Utt were for San Francisco, about one-half
that number being in transit for Central
America. When tha steamer was a few
days out from China two cases of small
pox were discovered among the Chinese
passengers. Every precaution was token
and the doctor insisted upon vaccinating
everybody aboard the vessel. Even the
captain did not escape and he and all his
subordinates are now nursing sore arms.
In fact every person who boards the China
these days cannot get within five yards of
any member of the crew without an ex
clamation of "Look out for ray arm !"
After the China reached Yokohama the
Japanese authorities took control. The
6ick men were landed and placed in quar
antine. The vessel was fumigated and
then allowed to go on her way. At Hono
lulu the Chinese passengers were allowed
to land and the vessel was given a clean
bill of health. On her arrival here Dr
Blue of the United States Marine Hospi
tal service and Dr. Chalmers, the State
quarantine officer, visited her. There was
no sign of contagion aboard, so the 129
Chinese and 44 Japanese for Kan Fran
cisco were landed on Angel Island, ac
cording to the United States laws govern
ing emigrants, and the China was allowed
to dock.
This was last Sunday, and yesterday it
was reported that two cases of smallpox
had appeared among the Chinese on the
island. In the meantime the officers and
Chinese crew have mingled freely with
the people who have had 1 business on the
steamer, and while there may be no fear
of contagion it would nevertheless have
been far better to have been sure than
sorry.
The China was sixteen days from Yoko-
and the quarantine officers thought
that any new cases would surely show
themselves in that time, as fourteen days
is the limit. It now appears that vaccina
tion suppressed the disease for a time, and
that it is now breaking out in spite of vac
cine.
Dr. Chalmers was interviewed late last
night, when he landed from the tug Gov
ernor Perkins. The doctor, smarting over
his discourteous reception on the island,
was not in a placid frame of mind. His
visit to his brother officer may best be told
in his own language:
"I am not in a pleasant humor over my
visit to Dr. Roseneau," he said, "and ray
complete failure to satisfy myself in re
gard to tbe sick Chinaman at the island.
To-day Dr. Blue informed me that there
was a case or two at the island, and I made
preparations to investigate. I immedi
ately took tbe quarantine tug and steamed
over to Angel Island. In the boat I
changed my clothing and took every pre
caution, as I intended to examine the
cases, and never dreamed of the reception
I got there. After keeping me waiting
half an hour Dr. Rosenean, the sur
geon in charge of the station, met
me, and to my query answered
that he found a Chinaman ill with vario
ioid. It was only a mild case, he said, and
he apparently did not attach any great
importance to it. He was not disposed to
go into details, and rather resented the
visit of a State official.
"I then asked if I might see the patient
and got a refusal straight from the shoul
der. 'No!' he said; 'you can't see the
Chinaman.' Dr. Roseneau was not only
lacking in professional courtesy, but he
assumed that he was independent of the
State quarantine officer, which he is not.
The Federal Government must co-operate
with the State in the enforcement of
sanitary regulations, with priority ac
corded to the medical officers of the State.
That is the law in the case.
"So I was bowed off the island like an
intruder. Now lam as much in the dark
regarding that case of smallpox, varioioid,
measles, hives, or whatever it is, as you
are. Nor can I understand for the life of
me why Dr. Roseneau refused to let
me see the case if he was sure of his
diagnosis, and I presume he is. When the
China arrived she had been sixteen days
from Yokohama, where she was fumi
gated first by the Japanese health author
ities, then by her own surgeon. She was
all right at Honolulu and had a clean
bill of health. I carefully examined
all of her people here, and as no sickness
was aboard, and the fourteen days of in
fection has passed, sfTe was permitted to
dock. The steerage passengers were sent
to Angel Island."
"But if this is a case of varoloid how do
you explain it that the man was taken
down with a form of smallpox two or
three days before the infection limit?"
the quarantine officer was asked.
"If the Chinaman has smallpox the
case is an exception to the fourteen-day
rule, which cannot be explained in medi
cal practice," he answered. "A germ may
be longer-lived and exist over the limit,
but medical authority sticks to the four
teen days.
"I do not know what the Angel Island
officials and the Paciric Mail people intend
to do regarding their passengers, but not
one- of them will land in this City unless I
am sure they have no contagious disease
among them. I have sent orders to the
Mail dock that they must not be brought
away from the quarantine station until
I know all danger is passed. I presume
the Millen Griffith wiil go after those pas
sengers to-morrow or next day, but if she
brings them here she will straightway
carry them back. If Dr. Roseneau has a
case of smallpox he will keep it until it
is cured, but 1 cannot understand his ac
tion to-nient. It is inexplicable. I shall
see tbe Board of Health immediately and
have this matter settled."
While the doctors are disagreeing the
public are asking: "Is the fourteen-day
limit to be depended upon, and how many
more varioioid cases are there in the.City ?"
MADE HIS FINAL HAVEN,
Death of Captain Talbot, United
States Inspector of Steam
ships and Hulls.
Was Born in Maine and Was a Prac
tical Mariner From Early
Youth.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 21. f
Captain C. S. Talbot died at his home
in East Oakland this evening. Although
he has not been enjoying good health for
some time his death was a surprise to his
friends, as it was generally supposed he
was improving.
Captain Talbot has been a United States
Inspector of Steamships and Hulls for
many years. He was a man of large ex
perience and during the past few years he
has led a very active life owing to tne in
crease in tbe steamship trade of San Fran
cisco. He was a very familiar fmure In
marine circle and his face, which was that
of a typical old mariner, will be greatly
missed from his office in the Federal
building.
The deceased was born in the State of
Maine over sixty-two years ago, and from
his earliest life he followed tne sea as a
proiession. He was rapidly promoted and
commanded several of the largest Amer
ican vessels afloat He was looked upon
as a very careful navigator, and never met
with a mishap of any importance.
He retired from the sea several years ago
and has been an inspector for a long time.
He lived with his family in East Oakland
and has been very little seen on this side
of the bay, all his work being in San
Francisco.
Last Saturday he was at bis office in
good spirits, but soon after arriving home
he was taken sick with stomach trouble.
Only quite recently did the malady de
velop serious symptoms.
Two physicians were called Sunday,
and were in constant attendance till death
came. Yesterday he was so low that the
absent members of the family were sum
moned by telegraph. This morning the
captain was ret. 1 , m,; easily, and the hopes
of his family lose proportionately.
This evenf'ic a relapse occurred and the
old sailor breathed his last about sun

SEEKING RICHER FIELDS,
Efforts to Be Made to Increase
Passenger Traffic From
the Orient.
Plans to Be Considered to Divert a Por
tion of It From the Suez Canal
Route.
There was an all-day session yesterday j
of the representatives of tha several trans
portation companies interested in trans
pacific passenger business, bat nothing of
a definite character was decided upon.
Upon a closer investigation of the situa
tion it has been found that efforts in tne
Orient can be advantageously directed
toward securing part of the traffic that now
moves by way of the Suez canal route.
Agent McKay, during the past year and
a half, has confined bis efforts to Yoko
hama and toward securing a proper share
of the trans-Pacific business for his roads
as against tbe more northern lines and
their connections. Much the larger por
tion of traffic originates at Hongkong,
â¢Shanghai and other China ports, and it is
probable that when Mr. McKay returns to
his post he will go clothed with authority
to establish sub-agenoies at these points,
and Honolulu may also receive special at
tention.
This is a field that has been virtually
neglected by the American transportation
companies, despite the well-known fact
that the Peninsular and Oriental and Mes
sagerie Maritime lines do an enormous
business from Japanese, Chinese and In
dian ports to Europe via the Suez canal,
part of which could undoubted!}' be
tempted to move this way.
It is expected that tbe conference will
continue for two or three days longer be
fore plans are finally adopted.
Laborers' Woes.
C. L. Collier and W. Wellington, sawmill
laborers recently from Mendociuo and Hum
bold t counties, have filed with Labor com
missioner Fitzgerald a complaint against the
sawmill owners ot the nortbern coast. The
principal complaint is directed against the
Usal Lumber Company and embraces tbe
charges that the firm overwork Its men and
defrauds the employes on the time-check sys
tem. The Labor Commissioner will investigate.
Orders have been received for forty laborers
for the Val ley road and seventy laborers lor a
construction company at Redding.

Westminster, Orange Co., May 18, 1896.
Dr. A. T. Sandtnâ Sib: The Belt whirh
I bought from you some time ago has cured
me. My disease was seminal weakness of five
years' standing. - 1 had emissions on nn aver,
age of five times a week, and many times three
in one night. luted all kinds of drugs and
patent medicines, and was, when I began your
treatment, in a very weak . condition, both
from my trouble and the many different drugs
I bad taken. As sooa as I applied your Belt I
found relief from my losses, in three weeks a '
general improved condition, and I am now en-
tirely cured. I cannot say too much in praise
of your Beit. Yours truly, J. M. lIUBBAKD.
No man can attain physical or muscular
perfection while there is any want of vital
force. It is the grit, the vim, the "ginger"
which supports the powers of endurance,
and the command of latent physical
strength. . : .
Every man knows himself. He knows
where he is weak. Knowing it, if he is
true to himself, he will try to recover the
vital power he has wasted.
The source of all physical power is in
the nerves. ' The life of the nerves is elec-
tricity. So science. Man, if you lack
any of the elements of manhood, will you
barter your future happiness any further
by letting this chance pass? Be one of
the progressive men. â  Perfect your man-
hood, physically, sexually, mentally.. â 
"A great change has come over me, and I
feel better than I ever did. 1 feel in such good
health that I cut about a cord of wood a day
and don't feel tired at nigat." 80 writes Mr.
JOHN W. PHILLIPS, Collar, Cal., June 2U.
A steady, even flow of electricity into your
body for several hours at night will bring
new life to the nerves, and from them to
the whole body. The , brain will be re- ''
freshed, the nerves strong, quick and ac-
tive, and every organ of your body will
. expand and develop in force and vitality.'
It will, in three ; months/ renew perfect
manly vigor in every part. It is as good
for women as for men. -
Al , permanent cure Is " guaranteed â or

Explanation.
The arrow flies with -.he wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and rtuiidredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, 'or solid
Una*, connect poln a of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accomuanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast.' When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" In he vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition!
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YOKE MARKETS.

NEW YORK. N. V., July 21.â The announce
ment that the New York City banks had de
termined to place a part of their gold at the disposal
of the Government, thus restoring .the treasury
gold reserve to the hundred million mark, changed
the temper of speculation at the Stock Exchange
lrom weakness to strength. This had a particu
larly good effect in London, and the early cables
brought higher prices and numerous orders for St.
Paul, Louisville and Nashville and some of the
railway mortgage* dealt in abroad. Estimates
place this buying as high as 25.000 shares of
stocks and $500,(>00 of railway and other bonds.
In addition to these favorable factors, it was
stated that the banking interests were at work on a
plan by which It is believed that gold shipments
can be diminished. Various suggestions have
been made, but nothing definite has been agreed
upon as yet. Even it ihe conferences on this sub
ject should come to naught, one thing can be re
lied upon ana that is the city banks will do every
thing in reason to help the trade. Some tankers
even want to plai c the entire stock at the disposal
of the Government subject to call by secretary
Carlisle. " ;
This manifestation of confidence stiffened United
stales fours ot 1925, and the bonus advanced to
114', a gain of V* from the recent low point. Buy
ing of securities was stimulated during the after
noon oy a falling off In tliedemaDd for sterling ex
change, and actual transactions In the latter were
reported at figures a quarter below quotations cur
rent at the opening. The decline in the exchange
ought to stop exports for the metal on Tue day,
ana it probably will. : The gain in stocks at one
time during the day was equal to @4 percent,
every prominent slock in tue list participating In
the upward movement. The industrials, grangers
and Internationals were most conspicuous In the
rise. Near the close the market suddenly broke

CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
. CHICAGO, lit, July 21.â T0-day's session of
the Board of Trade was absolutely the dullejt In
many weeks, the .pits at times being practically
deserted by the speculators. In wheat the govern
ing influence was the New York stock market,
and as it varied so did the wheat prices. As stocks
showed a tendency toward a firm feeling wheat
maintained a steadier tone, but the aggregate of
business was comparatively infinitesimal. The
talent said that the uncertainty arising from the
existing po'itlcal conditions was the mainspring
upon which the movement of trade depended and
the ventures of moment were not taken in conse
quence thereof.
Receipts in the Northwest were quite heavyâ
414 card, against 258 en the same Uav last year
and 497 on Tuesday last. Receipts at Chicago
were 459 cars, of which 442 were new. and the
withdrawals from store aggregated 88,000 bushels.
Liverpool cables were somewhat steady at un
changed prices. The Atlantic seaboard clearances
for twenty-fuur hours amounted to 435,000
bushels. Continental cables were generally
higher. Brad street's report of the world's visible
supply showed a decrease of 1.848,000 bushels.
On this and the large export clearances the market
closed steady. September wheat opened from
56Vrc to 66S/ 8 @56%c, sold between b7V @s7Vic
ana 56V4@5t>VsC, closing at &6%@67c, %c higher
thau yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row, 195 cars. ...
CORNâ weather was very bearish for corn
this morning, and offerings were large In conse
quence. The cables showed a decline of 1,4 c, and
the ieellng throughout the session was easy.
Here, as in wheat, the business was very light.
The receipts were away abov*> the expectations.
608 cars arriving, while 570 were estimated.
Withdrawals from store were light, 111, bush- i
els, and this was an additional dumper on trading.
Export clearances were 138,033 bushels. Brad
street's report on the world's visible supply placed
the decrease at 896,000 busies. September corn
opened at 26V*c, sold between 26% c and 26Vs@
26V4C, closing at U6V4@263/gc, unchanged from
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 200
cars.
OATSâ General debility was In command of this
cereal, and judginir from the appearance of the pit
an electrical battery would have been necessary to
put life into the trade. Receipts were 342 cars and
K6,905 bushels were removed from store. Brad
street's showing was a decrease of 1,245,000 bush
els, and*this checked a further decline. Septem
ber oats closed at 8 c under yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 170 cars.
FLAXâ Was easier: cash. 72%Â©72% c; Septem
ber, 72V4@72%c: December. 74@74%c; January,
74i4@75c. Receipts were 59 cars.
PBO VISIONSâ Showed an almost panicky
feeling with all sorts of product at the low prices
on general decline. At one time pork showed a
decline of about 25c per barrel, which Is a' most
tne lowest price ever touched for this productâ
86 02% last : July. Lard and ribs followed
suit for the record play and declined to near the
lowest figures ever made. September pork closed
15c lower, September lard 7%c lower, September
ribs 5@7%c lower.

TO BE BOOMED,
Captain Everett Brown of
Berkeley Talks About
Prospects.
PLENTY OF MATERIAL
Four New Men From South
ern California Will Enter
Next Month.
ATHLETES WANT GROUNDS
It Will Then Be Possible to Hold All
the Games Within an
Enclosure.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 21.â "Track
athletics will be on the boom next term,"
paid Captain Everett Brown of the Uni
versity of California track team to-day.
"A large part of my vacation has been
spent in looking for and picking out eood
men who intend to enter, and urging tbem
to keep in condition, so as to be ready for
the track as soon as they enter college.
We nave four young cracks who will be
here in August, and, together with the
men we have now, I believe that we can
make a much more creditable showing in
the spring meet with Stanford than in the
last intercollegiate.
"These four men to whom I refer are
Broughton of Santa Barbara, a rattling
good 220-yard man; McNab of Riverside,
an all-round crack; Cutter of San Jacinto,
a pole-vaulter with a record now of 10 feet
2 inches, and Birch of Santa Barbara, a
â printer who can now shave :10%.
"Of course we will be at somewhat of a
disadvantage in the matter of training
during tne fall season on account of the
absorbing interest taken in football, and
because of the bad weatber in winter, but
nevertheless we will try to get our muscles
into trim by spring. It will be our single
aim to defeat Stanford in the next inter
collegiate and reeain our lone held pres
tige over them on the track. They are a
wideawake lot of fellows down at Palo
Alto, and will leave no stones in their uath
to defeat us, but we will try to be equal to
the occasion. I can Bafely say that al
though we now have something like $800
in the treasury for an Eastern trip we will
not cross the Rockies until we have de
feated Stanford again and Deaten them
badly.
"What we need most of all now is a new
track, such as we proposed to the Board of
Regents last fall. We must have our
grounds within an enclosure, so as to
charge admission to tne grounds and thus
add importance to our meets, as well as
increasing our treasury.
"If our plans are carried out as we have
suggested them, within this enclosure will
be the running-track, with a straightaway
baseball diamond, football field and tennis
courts, with such grand stands and accom
modation houses as are necessary. We
must have a new track. All intend work
ing for it."
Miss J'eltun Returns.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 21.â Miss Katb
erine Felton, medalist in the class of '95 at
the State University, returned from the
University of Chicago yesterday, where
she has been taking post-graduate work in
political economy for the past year. Miss
Felton will re-enter Berkeley next month
and continue her post-graduate work in
anticipation of the doctor's degree.
In speaking of the University of Chi
cago Miss Felton said: "It is certainly a
very ereat institution. In the number of
post-graduate students at present attend
ing I believe it stands second of ail the
universities in America. I doubt not that
it will soon have the largest number of
students taking higher courses, if its
growth in the future continues in a corre
sponding ratio with the past."

Their Methods Outlined at the First
M K. Church.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 21.â The first
meeting of the American Volunteers was
heid in Oakland to-night at the First M.
E. Church. The attendance was good,
and all were pleased with the addresses
delivered. Major Washington Black
hurst, who represents Commander and
Mrs. Ballington Booth, was the principal
speaker. He said the volunteers were not
a duplicate of the old movement in many
senses of the word. He declared that they
would not antagonize the Salvation Army
or any other religious organization, but
march hand in hand to further the cause.
It is his desire to form a local post as soon
as advisable.
â¢â¢The Salvation Army has treated us in
a spirit of antipathy," "he said, "which we
Volunteers do not feel towards them in
the slightest degree. We have never
spoken unkindly of the Salvationists and
we are now merely defining and explain
ing our situation without saying anything
against anyone. The Volunteers are in a
flourishing condition and are increasing
eteadily. Thirty branch organizations
have been formed in New York and vicin
ity, ten in Western New York and Penn
sylvania, and forty-two in Chicago and vi
cinity."

splendeus, but it ia better known as the
crucifixion plant. It is the little red flower
that grows in the region of Mount Calvary
I and which, it is said, turned red as blood
j on the night of the crucifixion of Christ
"The space will be somewhat limited,
bur there will be quite a display. The lo
cal florists and some of the Japanese
flower-growers will help and there will be
a display better than anything yet at
tempted in Oafcland."
A delegation from the executive com
i mittee will visit Alameda Wednesday
evening and will meet the citizens of that
place to arrange for Alameda day. Some
special features will be prepared, and the
I Encinal City will do something note
worthy in the way of advertising itself.
A snecial meeting was held last night to
j make the necessary arrangements for
Thursday, August 6, on which day the to
tal proceeds, both afternoon and night,
will 50 to the woodyard fund of the Asso
sociated Charities.
The following committees were ap
pointed to attend to the details of charity
day:
Booth- Mr?. J. W. Shanklin, Mrs. D. S. Hirsh
bcrp and Mrs. P. H. Templeton.
Programmeâ Rev. K. B. Chapman, D. Edward
Collins aud Mrs. Paul Lohse.
Advertisingâ H. M. McKnight, Miss Mollie
Conners, Mrs. William McDonald and Mrs.
H. Rief.
The Associated Charities expect to make
enough money on the day of the benefit to
run their woodyard through the whole
winter.
The applications for space are still com
ing in from 'all over the county, and Su
perintendent Craigie Sharp thinks that
additional space will have to be provided,
although a I urge tent with a wooden floor
containing 8000 square feet has just been
erected.
The exposition will open August 8, and
an attempt is being made to have Gover
nor Buda declare it open.
SUSPECT FIREBUGS.
Haystack Fire* Upcoming Common at
Teineseal.
TEMESCAL, Cal., July 21.â Two fires
occurred here Saturday night that has
strengthened the suspicion that incen
aiarism has been practiced. Both fires
were haystacks.
About 11 o'clock, as George McClellan
was driving along College avenue, he
passed a cart and horse standing along
side of a field belonging to a Mr. Smith.
Shortly after he was overtaken by a man
driving a horse and cart, which he recog
nized as the one he had passed. At the
same time be saw Smith's haystack blaze
up.
The driver wa3 stopped by McClellan
and taken back to Smith's house. Mr.
Smith ident : fied him as a Portuguese
with whom he had had trouble. As Mr.
Smith's loss was quite large it was decided
to hold the Portuguese pending an investi
gation and he was sent to the jail.
The second nre occurred immediately
afterwards on the property of Mr. Mc-
Adam, near the schooihouse. His entire
stock of hay, valued at $250, was destroyed.
It is thought that tnis fire was incendiary,
too, although there is no positive proof of
the fact.
RUSS ELECTED IN A RUSH
School Directors Violate One of
Their Own Rules, and Are
Not Warned.
Secretary McClymonds Broke His
Record by Forgetting for the
First Time in Office.
Oakland Orricr.. Sa>- Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 21. f
The members of the Board of Edu
cation were considerably surprised
! this evening to find that they still
1 had a vacancy in the High School.
j Last evening, upon the selection of J.
!T. Draper of the High School to fill
the position of teacher of natural science
in the Central Grammar School, the board
went into executive session and wrangled
for nearly an hour over a choice for teacher
of drawing.
Some of the members would not vote at
all, while others tried to make them.
Finally they tired of that task and took
up the matter of a teacher to fill Mr.
Draper's vacant chair. This was an easy
matter, and Raymond Russ, O. H. S., '92,
and U. C, '96, was readily elected.
Russ is the son of ex-school director
John Russ. and is well known.
The election took place in open board,
with no opposition, but in this the mem
bers of the board overlooked a sentence in
section 65 of the rules and regulations
they have provided for tneir own govern
ment.
It reads: "No teacher shall be elected to
a position in the High School who has not
had at least two years' experience in
school work." If the rules are to govern
their action another teacher will have to
be elected, and in order for him to be on
hand at the opening of the school a meet
ing of the Board of Education will have to
be called for that purpose this week.
Director Reed, said in regard to the
matter: "If Mr. Russ is not eligible I am
of the opinion that we will have to call a
meeting thi* week and elect one who is."
Director Ford was surprised and said:
"If that rule was carried out in every dis
trict there would be no chance for the
teachers to ever get any experience. How
ever, the point is well taken, I believe."
The most surprising point in the in
teresting incident is the position of Secre
tary McClymonds. He is rightfully
credited with knowing- more about the
board and its prerogatives than the mem
bers, and surprise is general that his
memory should lapse when the son of an
ex-School Director is concerned.
Mr. Russ only graduated in May last
and has had no experience.
The friends of Mr. Kuss suggest that the
rule referred to is unconstitutional and not
binding, as the law does not contemplate
any such qualification as the rule imposes

ANXIETY 10 PROTECT LIFE.
Highland Park Cars Are No Longer
Rug With Only One
Man.
Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call.)
908 Broadway, July 21. )
A new device for assisting people struck
by electric-cars to aid in saving their own
lives has been invented by Superintend
ent Grim of the Oakland Consolidated
(Berkeley) line.
The new arrangement consists of two
plain, stout horizontal iron bars placed in
the front of the car. One 13 about three
feet and the other about five feet from the
ground. The supposition is that when
anyone is on the track and cannot get off
The Lifc-Ilar Device That Has Been
Placed on the Grove-Street Cars.
in time to prevent being struck they would
naturally grab one of the bara and avoid
getting beneath the wheels.
Mr. Grim says that he has found as the
result of inquiry that people struck by
cirs invariably try to grasp something,
and if stout bars are within reach at con
venient height they will probably avert
fatalities.
The new method will undoubtedly prove
very timely to the small boys of Oakland
who have practiced train-jumping for
many years, but as the majority of violent
deaths are those of children or of people
in vehicles, which collide with the cars,
the bars woula not in svfch cases prove
very valuable.
The superintendent of the Grove-street
road wrote to the Chief of Police today,
telling him he had seen the article in The
Call referring to the numerous violations
of the crossing ordinance. The writer
stated that he had given very positive in
structions to all his men to obey the ordi
nance implicitly, and asking that all mo
tormen and conductors breaking the law
be at once arrested. It was through a
doubly fatal accident on this line that the
law was passed, and Superintendent Grim
is doing all in his power to prevent its re
currence.
A police officer stated to-day that he had
frequently warned carmen at the danger
ous crossing at Thirteenth street and
Broadway and that the infractions were
less numerous than formerly.
A few weeks ago complaint was made
through The Call of the manner in which
the large double-decK cars of the Highland
Park were run with only one man. who
left the car to fly down a grade while he
went on the npp*r deck to collect nickels.
Since the publication Superintendent
Woodward has made arrangements by
which each car is attended by two men.
There was an ordinance before the Council
providing that no electric cars should run
with one man. but for some unknown rea
aon it did not become a law.

Druggist Desmarais' Death.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 21.â Paul X.
Desmarais, formerly a druggist of this
city, died in Chicago to-day. At the time
of his death Mr. Desmarais was on his
way to the coast for his health. Heart
disease was the cause of his death.
He formerly conducted a drugstore at
the corner of Twenty-third avenue and
East Fourteenth street. Five years ago he
sold it to h. D. Keliogg & Co., who still
retain it. He was 45 years of age and
leaves a widow, who is with relatives in
Cohoes, N. Y. A nephew who remained
here after his uncle's departure is now at
Folsom.
No More Jail Breaks.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 21.â The Sheriff
is taking necessary precautions to prevent
any more of his boarders from taking
French leave. All of the windows open
ing into cells from the outside are being
covered with a sheet of iron perforated
with holes about an inch square.
They are so fixed that they cannot be
reached from the inside unless the iron
grates are removed. If that is done and
the fastenings cut away the plates woula
fall to the ground, making enough racket
to gwe an alarm.
THE CITY CLERK'S REPORT
An Elaborate Statement of the

Past Year.
Alameda Parlor's Installationâ The
Board of Education Meeting.
Accidents.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 21.â The City
Clerk has just completed bis first annual
report. In it he suggests that the system
of accounts as kept at present should be so
modified as to allow the keeping of the
accounts of each department under separ
ate heads. He thinks the advantages of
the city as a place for building homes and
establishing industries should be adver
tised by means of pamphlets.
From the statement of accounts it ap
pears that the total disbursements of the
city for the last year of thirteen months J
amounted to $308,0iM 01; the actual running i
expenses $161,564 51. and the bonded !
indebtedness $239,175. The assessed value
of city property is $515,201. The chief items
of expenses are: Police departmeent,
$15,592 95; fire department and alarms.
$19,35126; City Hall, $44,470 39; electric
light. $5198 30; additions to plant, $21.
--91096: streets, $12,468 58 ; Health Office,
$3709 liO; water springing and flushing,
$11.477 33. The bonded indebtedness will
be reduced at the rate ol $18,775 per year.
The Native Sons.
ALAMEDA, Cal,. July 21.â The public
installation of the officers of Alameda Par
lor No. 47, N. S. G. W., by District Grand
President HyneÃ of Redwood Parlor, in
Armory Hall last night, evoked high praise
from the great number of friends who at
tended. The ceremony was conducted
faultlessly and the entertainment that fol
lowed was one to suit the taste of every
body. Attorney J. E. Barber delivered
the oration and acquitted himself of the
task in admirable fashion. Max Glas of
the State Blind Asylum, Temescal, brougnt
with him three inmates of the asylum, ;
who provided such music as astounded the \
listeners and dancers. One of them, Gus- i
sle Mast, received a merited ovation for !
her song, to which she played her own ac- [
companiment. The Native Sons from j
Oakland belonging to the Acme Club were j
present, and their boxing, wrestling and j
acrobatic feats were just the thing.
The officers installed were: Past presi- j
dent, John Flynn: president, Charles Day;
first vice, J. F. Hanson; second vice, Max
Glas: third vice, J. N. Bolt; marshal, R.
tf. Fallmer; treasurer, S. A. Bremer;
financial secretary, Max Gundlach ; re
cording secretary, T. R. Hanson ; inside
sentinel. N. E. Probst; outside sentinel,
P. Smith: trustee, J. E. Barber.
The parlor is now twelve years old and
has 104 members.
Alameda Driving Association.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 21.â The Ala
meda Driving Association met last night
and adopted a new set of bylaws. Their
adoption necessitated an election of offi
cers, which resulted in Judge Ellsworth
being chosen president; Sanford Bennett,
vice-president; I. S. Borden, treasurer; C.
C. Gardner, secretary; a. L. Cohen and
Dr. Bull, members of the executive com
mittee.
The track is to be utilized for training
horses as well as for driving. Those wish
ing to train on it must make application
to the executive committee and then pay
$2 per month for a single horse and $1
extra for each additional horse up to three.
Trne'i Strength Waning.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 21â C. F. True,
the deposed principal of the Wilson School,
has apparently given up bis attempt to
have the Board of Education reinstate him.
The mass-meeting of his friends, which
was to nave been held last evening, did not
come off, and at the. meeting of the Board
of Education to-night, the True forces

A Train Kills a Horse.
ALAMEDA, Cal^ July 21.â 0n the same
crossing that the Fruitvale Jersey Dairy
wagon was shattered yesterday morning
by a freight train, a horse got fixed in the
cattle guard this morning. When the
Haywards locomotive came along the en
gineer was unable to stop his train in time
and the horse was cut to pieces. The first

An Accidpnt in Camp.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 21.â News has
bÂ«en brought in that ayounj? San Francis
can named McPhee. who is camping with
some others on the Redwood road near
Graham & Arnold's dairy ranch, had met
with a serious accident.
From accounts to hand it appears he
met with his accident just as he was set
ting out for a ride on horseback. He had
but vaulted into the saddle when the
horse plunged and reared violently. Mc-
Fhee in his excitement polled on the reins
and the animal fell over backward the
! rider underneath. The horn of the saddle
j struck the youns man, inflicting a serious
I and painful wound. It ie thought tnat
nis spine is also hurt.
A doctor from East Oakland is in at
tendance and McPhee will be confined to
camn for some little time to come.

NEED NOT USE
THE RATTLER TEST
Richmond Streets May Be
Macadamized With
Red Rock.
THE OWNERS SATISFIED
Supervisors as a Committee of
the Whole Take De
cided Action.
MANY QUARRIES CAN BE USED
A Motion to Use Red Rock for Side
walk Foundations Voted
Down.
The Board of Supervisors, sitting as a
committee of the whole, spent several
hours yesterday listening to arguments
for and against the use of the rattler test
in the selection of rock for street work.
A large delegation of property-owners
from the Richmond district was present to
urge the abolition of the test, because they
wish to use the red rock found in the
vicinity. This rock will not stand the
rattler test. , Attorney Van Duzer,
representing the property - owners,
urged that the test was not a
fair one, because the residents of
Richmond were compelled to buy blue
rock, which was expensive, because it was
brought irom a lons distance, when good
red rock was to be found right on the
ground. Colonel Mendel, formerly a Gov
ernment engineer, stated that he had used
blue rock in the foundations for the big
guns at the Presidio. He considered it
better than red rock, though he admitted
that some red rock might be good.
Superintendent of Streets Frodden of
Aiameaa was in favor of blue rock. He
had seen both kinds used in the streets of
Alameda, and in every instance the blue
rock was the most durable. Red rock top
dressing was generally washed away by
the winter rains.
Joseph Scheerer, an advocate of red
rock and the owner of a quarry, produced
some samples that he claimed were as
good as any blue rock. He claims that
the people of the Richmond district would
actually be impoverished if they were
compelled to use blue rock.
Colonel Newberry was opposed to the
rattler test, claiming that an inspection
was a far better method of determining
the value of the various rocks.
Engineer Humphreys, who is employed
by the Government at the Presidio, ex
pressed a preference for blue rock and the
rattler test.
Attorney G. B. Lukens, representing
the Cushing-Wetmore Company, addressed
the committee on the subject of rock for
street work and advocated strongly the
rattler test in selecting rock. He con
tended that the qualities necessary for
rock for street work were tenacity and
hardness, and that the rattler was the only
method of finding our these attributes.
He read a letter from G. T. Allardt, a
tivil engineer, stating that blue or gray
irap rock was by far the best material for
building streets and roadways.
President Sullivan of the Federated Im
provement Clubs spoke against red roefc.
After listening to an extended closing
argument from Attorney Van Duzer, in
which the latter begged the committee to
consider the poor people who would be
benefited if they were permitted to use
red rock in the improvements of their
streets, the committee went into executive
session.
After considering the matter at some
length it was decided that the residents of
the outlying districts were entitled to
some consideration and that a distinct
concession should be made them. Super
visor Spreckels moved that the district
west of Central avenue, from Geary street
to the southerly line of California street,
and in the Richmond District, also the
Sunset District, west of Stanyan street, be
exempt from the necessity of using the
rattler test for rock to be used for ma
cadam. The motion was earned unani
mously. This will permit the use of the
red rock of the outlying districts for pav
ing of the streets in that section. The
regulations for sidewalk and bituminous
paving remain the same as before.
A motion Dy Supervisor King to elim
inate the rattler test on rock to be used for
sidewalk foundations all over the City was
lost.
IN RICHMOND DISTRICT.
The "Steam Paddies" at Work
Moving the Mountains
of Sand.
Red Rock Us:d by the Railroad for
Pavinz, White by the Prop
erty-Own rs.
The work of removing the mountains of
sand has begun in Richmond District in
earnest, and now Warren & Malley have
two "steam paddies" scooping into the
dunes.
A steam paddy is a series of buckets or
shovels rnn on an endless chain, which
sends a constant stream of s*and into the
cars that are hauled on the 15-inch gauge
railway to the dumping-place.
The shovels are moved from place to
place, whirling on a pivot, by the engi
neer, and they eat into the earth with
surnrisine rapidity.
One of these big machines has been re
moving the tail hill lying just west of the
Odd Fellows' Cemetery, ana last Monday
another started up to remove the large
tract of sand west of Eighth avenue and
next to Golden Gate Park. There are
about fifty blocks of this job, and it is esti
mated that it will take two years to trans
fer the soil to the dumping-place, the
ravines and depressions in The old race
track.
The advocates of the Richmond red
rock are nnch interested by the fact that
the railroad company is paving between
and on each hive of the two lines of car
track with that material. Tue property
owners are forced by the City to do their
paying oa the same thoroughfare with the
objectionable blue rock, and they cannot
understand why this discrimination ex
ists. The red reck is cheap and handy
*"d the other costly and its quarry ai a
distance. A locomotive and train of flat
cars loaded with the Richmond rock are
run along the avenue and dumped where
the material is needed â an easy and rapid
way to pave a street.
The foreman of the railroad graders was
asked- yesterday why the company was
using rock which the Street Superin
tendent had interdicted.
"Because it is better lor paving," he
answered. "It packs harder and makes a
Bmoother and more durable road. We
first put down a thick bed of firm stuff,
then a layer of coarse material. We then
roll it and there you are."
And the property-owners wonder why
they cannot do the same.
The residents of Ninth and Twenty
fourth avenues state that the owners of
the many vacant lots on those thorough
fares neglect to buikhead their property,
consequently the sand has drifted down
from the high dunes on to the roadways.
The avenues were graded and macadam
ized less than twelve months aeo, and the
work is completely covered. Some por
tions of the streets are impassable.
The following are the numbers of the
fire-alarm boxes in the district west of
Central avenue: Caliiornia street and Cen
tral avenue 325. Gearv and Boyce 327,
Geary and Wood 328, Third avenue and
Point Lobos 412, Seventh avenue ana Cle
ment 413, Twelfth avenue and Clement
415, First avenue and Fulton 416, Fifth
avenue and C 418, Fourth avenue and

Point Lobos 485, Cliff House 486.
Sale of Church Property.
The Westminster Presbyterian Society of the
City and County of San Francisco, a corpora
tion, has applied to the Superior Court for per
mission to sell its property at Fell and Octavia
streets. The building there is said to be oM
and untenable and it Is desired to dispose of it
for the purpose of securing money to erect a
new edifice on the society's property at Page
and WebHter streets. A bid of $11,896 has been
received for the old Drorjertv.
An Estate in France.
Public Administrator Freese has filed for
probate the will of Ellsa Boers, who died in
Paris, France, February 17, 1896. leaving a
$4tXK) estate to Jeanne L. Sawyer of this City,
auÂ«l Marguerite de Montoisy and Renee de
Montoisy residing iv France.

DANGER LURKS BENEATH THE PAVEMENT,
Channel - Street Sewer on
the Swift Road to
Ruin.
CRUMBLING OF THE ARCH
Jarring to Pieces Under the
Wheels of Southern Pa
cific Trains.
ELDER'S STARTLING DISCOVERY
Track-Builders Hastening to Move
the Steel Rails to a Place of
Greater Safety.
George W. Elder, the official expert of
the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, has made a great discovery.
The Channel-street sewer, he has ascer
tained, is cracked in several places. Bricks
have dropped from the arch, mortar has
fallen off.
This sewer is the drainage outlet for
more square miles of populated territory
The Street Committee of the Supervisors has discovered that the great Channel-street sewer has been dangerously cracked by the passage over it of heavy trains.
Many square m.les are dependent on the integrity of the big drainage outlet and its collapse would also mean extreme peril to traffic. The Southern Pacific Railroad
Company has taken the alarm. The picture represents a force of men at Sixteenth and Channel Streets yesterday endeavoring to equalize the pressure on the sewer by
putting down a new track. In the meantime the utmost caution is exercised in running trains over the doubtful locality.
in the city Oi San Francisco than any
other big drain here existing. All tht>i
portion of the City in the region of the
panhandle of the park, a large slice of ter
ritory south of McAllister street, the en
tire Mission, and in fact fully one-half of
the densely populated portion of San
Francisco, is much concerned in the intep;
rity of the Channel-street sewer directly.
The sewer was built in 1876. Twenty
years it bas served its purpose well.
Within the past two months it has been
shattered, perhaps fatally, and by the
trains of the Southern Pacific Company.
The sewer is not alone in danger.
The Southern Pacific Company's trains
crawl along at a snail's pace on the main
track between Sixteenth and Ninth streets.
The construction department of the rail
road has fears that the cars may crush
through the top of the sewer as through an
eggshell, and fall with passengers or
freight 10 the bottom of the drain. The
situation is conceded to be very serious
and very novel.
A vigorous search was made yesterday
for Mr. Eider. He was found on the cor
ner of Sixteenth and Channel streets, in
tensely absorbed in watering some opera
tions upon the track above the sewer and
upon the old paintshop of the Southern
Pacific Company, which latter workmen
were uemolishing as speedily as possible.
A gang of trackmen stood on the track,
not far from the old paintshop, busied
somewhat with work on the compara
tively new roadbed, which has been down
only a few weeks. Mr. Elder at first was
less communicative than the railroad em
ployes. It was known by the representa
tive of The Call, on the spot, that not
many day 3 apo there was a somawhat
sensational exit from the sewer of men

quaked and trembled and the floor of it
was jarred violently. The demonstration
was so striking that the Street Depart
ment employes, thinking that discretion
was the beter part of valor, made a pre
cipitate retreat and declined to return to
work in the sewer.
Also from other sources of information
it had come to the knowledge of The Call
that, following this alarm, which was
promptly communicated to the head of
the Street Department, the Southern Pa
cific Company was notified that their
trains were in danger because of the cracks
in the sewer. About that time the cars
began to move so slowly that every one
noticed the snail's pace and remarked it.
No one vouchsafed any information as a
matter of course. A painted board having
upon it the word "slow" was placed be
tween the main track above the sewer and
the side track, a few feet to the south of
the sewer. That order to the engineers is
followed implicitly.
Mr. Elder's mission when he was found
at Channel and Sixteenth streets was so
manifest, in the light of information al
ready received, that he did not deny it.
He was at that place to acquire informa
tion and to observe the effect of passing
trains. Not far below Sixteenth street
there projects a manhole, only a few feet
| from the main track. This has been ob- .
j served to sway back and forth when trains
j ran at the old rate of speed, and was, in
fact, one of the first manifestations con
cernin? the shaking up which the railroad
was giving the sewer. "While the repre
sentative of The Call looked on the
whistle of a locomotive was heard in the
distance. A few seconds later a passenger
train from San Jose appeared.
The eewer has its proper outlet at Ninth
street and its beginning at Sixteenth
street. Between these two points there Is
a distance of over 4000 feet, or, roughly
estimated, about three-fourths of a mile.
The train crossed Sixteenth street hardly
moving, having steadily slackened its
speed for some distance before the cross
ing was reached. The engineer and rire
| men were hanging out of opposite sides of
I the locomotive cab. The occupants of the
I baggage-car were in the door openings of
I that vehicle. They occupied these posi
tions all the time the wheels were drag
ging slowly along to Ninth street. The
passengers seemed unconscious that there
was any particular reason for tnis su<iden
and long spell of slow riding, but looked
j about curiously nevertheless.
The section or track hands of the
Southern Pacific Company who were in
evidence watched the track and train
alike keenly, suspending their work tem
porarily.
One of the track-workers, a man evi
dently acquainted with the facts, ex
plained quite fully what was going on.
The old paintshop is being torn down, he
| said, to make room for track-laying south
j of the present embankment, upon which
! at this point, there are two tracks and
switches.
"What is the need of this?" was asked.
"The sewer is cracked."
"Wnat are the men going to do?"
"They are going to put down a new
track to equalize the pressure upon the
sewer and to take off the direct pressure."
The foundation of the old paintshop is
at least ten feet below the level of the top
of the present railroad embankment. Con
sequently at least that height of earth
must be made there and the new bank will
have to be extended from 2000 to 3000 feet
at least. This work will be quite expen
sive. The fact was noted as signiricant of
the dangers existing.
"What do you know about this matter?"
was abked of Mr. Eider.
"Well, I know that the sewer is cracKed
because I sent a man in thÂ«Â»re to make an
inspection. The Street Department did
not give me the information, but I found
out that there was trouble. The man who
went into the sewer for me is one whom I
can fully trust to report the facts fairly,
and he is fully competent to judge of the
facts, being a skilled mechanic. I have
personally looked through the- sewer and
have satisfied myself by my own observa
tion that the sewer has been badly dam
aged. There are several cracks. One of
them is very long. Others are shorter.
Some pieces of brick have fallen or been
shaken from the arch. The condition of
the mortar shows that it fell lately, and
there is no doubt that the cracks wnich I
saw are fresh.
"1 consider this a serious matter. The
Southern Pacific Company seems to be
getting ready to move its tracks before the
winter season, when the rains are sure to
test the btrength of the sewer. I have
been studying and watching down here
for st-veral days, but I did not know posi
tively until to-day all the facts of which I
am now possessed, I did not want to say
anything until I was sure.
"The main tract of the railroad, which
is above the sewer, has been in its present
position only about two months. It was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1896.
necessary to mike a fill of possibly ten
feet to provide a roadbed. At the outset
seeing what waa contemplated I said the
rolling of heavy trains over the sewer
would hurt it, and since the roadbed was
put down i have kept careful watch.
"The first sign to me that there was
trouble was given by the slowing down of
the trains. Then, as I have said, I sent
in an expert to inspect and also make a
personal inspection of the interior of the
sewer. It is true that the workmen em
ployed by the Street Department to clean
the sewer were frightened away when the
sewer shook around them. They were
afrai'.l that they might be killed by masses
of falling bricks.
"The main track, over which the passen
ger and freight trains are run to and from
San Jose, was formerly in the yard, and it
was necessary, in order to run around in
this direction, to make the fill above the
sewer.
"When the track was being laid I told
some of the railroad people that they were
inviting danger, but they seemed to think
that I was mistaken, and said so. All the
time I was confident that the track would
damage the sewer. I have seen the shaking
of a manhole beside the track from some
distance when a train was passing over
the sewer. Only to-day have I become
fully aware concerning the damage which
has been accomplished. Workmen have
refused to enter the sewer during the past
three or four days because it was shaken
so.
"The railroad trains are not moving here
now at a greater speed than four miles
per hoar as you have observed. The rail
road company is taking every precaution
to avoid accidents. It would oe awkward
to have a train tall through to the bottom
of the sewer. The track is less than five
feet wide, and the sewer is eleven feet
wide, so that there is room for that to

ous Condition of the Sewer.
happen. The crackÃ that I saw extend
most of the way from Sixteenth street to
Fourteenth. The arch is broken and
bricks protrude, while some have fallen.
The railroad men admit that they are
shifting tracks to take the strain off the
sewer.
"A collapse in winter time of the sewer
would be very serious. It would affect
property-owners in an area embracing
many square miles of residence property.
The sewer has not been able always to
carry off all the volume of water poured
into it during protracted and hard storms
in the past. From Eighteenth street as
far down as Thirteenth street, and as far
up as Howard street, more or less damage
has been done during heavy rains simply
because the drainage could not be carried
off. I have seen manhole covers lifted
out and water shot out to a height of from
six to eight feet at the crossing of Eigh
teenth and Shotwell streets, and at other
points.
"I have seen boxes floated out of
grocery stores on account of the backing
of water in that section when the Chan
nel-street sewer was clear to carry off all
the drainage. When the pressure of all
the water in its wide area of drainage is
brought to bear next winter the full ef
fect will be felt on the cracks and may
cau?e a collapse. That would mean a loss,
which in total it is difticu't to approxim
ately estimate, especially if the cave-in
should take place in the night. If the
cave-in should happen between Ninth or
Tenth and Twelfth streets the whole sew
age of a great part of the City would be
arrested.
"Enough damage may have been done
already to cans* a collapse. Only two
years ago, the sewer, of coarse, being opeu,
Mr. Helms, a grocer, got damages amount
ing to $1600 against tne City for water set
back from the Channel-street sewer."
Train after train crept slowly along be
tween Ninth and Sixteenth streets yester
day. When afternoon came a large force
of men was put to wort by the Southern
Pacific Company. The force tearing down
the paintshop in the yards was doubled.
Over a hundred men were set to work fill
ing in for the new track to be laid and the
dirt flew with haste. The work will be
pushed so that the main track may be
moved to a safe place as soon as possible.
Concerning the Channel-street sewer
the following additional facts are learned
at the office of the City and County Sur
veyor: The outlet is 8 feet 6 inches by 11
feet 6 inches in dimensions. The height
at Sixteenth street is only about 5 feet,
and the breadth there is less. Formerly
the t lacks of the railroad ran about 20 feet
from the sewer. The brickwork is in four
sections, the length of the sections being
respectively, 620, 1587, 1458 and 415 feet.
The total length of the brick structure is
4080.74 feet. The fall is about 8 feet to the
mile. The sewer is round and is plastered
over the bricks on the inside.
HIS WIFE'S BAD TEMPER.
Cigar-Dealer Lansj Lays All Hi* Family
Troubles at His Spouse's Door.
The answer of Charles Lang, the Pine
street cigar-dealer, to the complaint in di
vorce of his wife, Bessie Lang, has been
filed.
He denies the charges of his better half
that he dragged her about the house by
her hair; that he hit her with a chair;
that be called her vile namss, or that dur
ing her illness he said he hoped she would
die. He admits, however, that he did
strike at her with a chair. He say? that
at the time of that episode he was asleep
about 10 p. m., when his daughter called to
him, s lying, her mother was abusing her.
He got up, and in the altercation that fol
lowed struck at his wife with the article of
furniture mentioned.
Lang claims that his wife has a violent
I temper, is addicted to the nse of vile lan-
I guat;e, drinks to excess, and is not a fit
i custodian for her children.
For a further and separate answer the
husband asserts that his wife's name is
Bridget, not Bessie, and that on May 14
she deserted him, and that the two older
children, being allowed to use their own
discretion in the matter, remained with
him.
Lang prays for the custody of the chil
dren and that his wife be restrained from
; interfering with the community property.
j He also claims that the income from his
business is but $35 per month, not |150, as
i claimed by his wife.

Wheelmanâ Making Progress
With Details.
The cyclists demonstration on the 25th
for new paved streets will undoubtedly be
a most original and entertaining parade
for several reasons.
The Bay City Wheelmen promise special
features in the way of floats. Six or eight
have already been prepared. The nature
of the floats is a close secret and will be
divulged only on the night of the jollifi
cation.
The Imperial Club will turn out over
200 men with every wheel decorated.
The Vailejo Club has asked for an as
signment in line and the committee has
decided to put this club, with the Acme
and Reliance of Oakland, together with
the other clubs of the suburban bay towns,
in one division.
The parade will be headed by children
riders. It is said that San Francisco has
the smallest bicycle riders in ail the world,
and the City intends to demonstrate this
In the parade. The youngest wheelmen
will be only 3 years old.
The committee on parade purchased
3000 lanterns for decorations yesterday,
and wili place another order for as many
more before the end of tnis week.
Judge Campbell has been requested to
lead the unattached wheelmen.
The electric liglit company has agreed
to furnish electric lights tor the grand
stand. As regards decoration, the com
mittee has decided to concentrate flags,
buntings and illumination at the corner
of Fourth and Market streets.
The prize for the best-mounted aid to
the grand marshal will be a handsome
gold medal, the size of a silver dollar, with
the head of a horse in bas relief on one side
and on the obverse the words: "Awarded
to South Side Improvement Club, July 25,
1896." The Merchants' Association has
joined issue with the cyclers and the South
Side chilis.
The executive committee of the Cycle
Board of Trade and the South Side Im
provement clubs met last night at 18 Mc-
Allister street, and made considerable
headway with arrangements. Various
committees reported, and the reports were
acted upon at once.
The outlook is that next Saturday night
there will be at least 4000 wheels in the
parade. All will be decorated, and many
of them will be elaborately ornamented.
Some revelations in the way of decora
tions of wheels are promised. The most
sanguine, active workers in getting up the
parade predict that there will be any
where from 4000 to 8000 decorated wheels
in line, and this would matte one of the
most novel and gorgeous illuminated pa
rades San Francisco has ever seen.
Reports of the committees last evening
show that a platoon of police will head
the parade; that the Superintendent of
Streets will be requested to clean up on
Friday the streets over which the parade
wili move; that outside clubs from Val
lejo, Banta Rosa, Petaluma, Napa and
other surrounding towns will be in line;
that there will be an immense bonfire at
Market street and Van Ness avenue; that
! bushels of redfire and fireworks galore
: will be set off; that illuminated banners
will be carried showing the inscription,
"RepayÂ« Market Street"; that there will
be numerous beautiful illuminated floats
of unique and wonderful design; that
there will be four or five brass bands in
wagons to stir the air with music, and
that there will be other interesting feat
ures, the particulars of which are kept
secret until they astonish the admiring
public in their debut.
One of the most attractive divisions of
the parade will be composed of the Alpha
Ladies' Cycle Club. The ladies will ride
at the head of the procession. They in
vite lady riders who are not attached to
the club to join with them.
The South Side Improvement clubs,
â¢ while co-operating with the general parade,
have made arrangemen U to do a little inde
pendent booming of the South Side on
their own hook and at their own expense.
For instance, they have leased a vacant
lot across from the speakers' stand, at
1 Market street and Van Ness avenue, Â»nd
around this lot will oe letters composed of
Japanese lanterns, reading as follows:
"Finish Folsom Street and Repave Mar
ket." Besides this they will send up count
less paper balloons all over .own bearing
the same demand.
A brass band will play between speeches
on the stand, which will also be deco
rated.

WOMAN SUFFRAGE NOTES
Return of Miss Mary Hay From
the Chautauqua
Assembly.
Precinct Clubs Are Be ng Organized
All Over the City and in
the Interior.
Miss Mary E. Hay, chairman of the
Woman Suffrage State Central Commit
tee, returned yesterday afternoon from
her trip to Pacific Grove, where she has I
organized a large Woman Suffrage club.
"I found much enthusiasm among the
suffragists at Pacific Grove," she said,
shortly after her return, "and they re
fused to be satisfied until they had a club.
So I called a meeting, and before I knew
it the club was formed, with Mrs. Hollen
beck as its president.
"The woman's day at the Chautauqua
assembly was a grand day for us. Tne at
tendance was simply astonishing in its
magnitude, women coming from far and
near. On Monday night Miss Anthony
made a lons address before several thou
sand people. The great auditorium wus I
packed from the platform to the vestibule,
numbers being unable to force their way in
to the building. Miss Anthony's appearance
was greeted with repeated bursts of cheer
ing, in which the men's voices fairly
drowned out those of the women. She
spoke as I have never heard her speak
before and carried her audience by storm.
Mrs. Blinn also spoke and seemed to have
imbibed a liberal draught of the spirit of
the hour, for her eloquence made her
sway the minds of her hearers like one
inspired.
"And now," concluded Miss Hay, with
an accent of finality in her voice which
meant business, "my correspondence has
been gathering since my departure last
week, and 1 have a mountain of letters
to answer; so don't expect me to talk any
more."
The committee's rooms in the Woman
Suffrage Bureau are always kept fragrant
with flowers, members and friends seem
ing to vie with each other as to who
snail send the fairest and sweetest
floral expressions of their loyalty to
the cause. An addition has been
mad* to the furniture in the shape of a
most gracefully designed and highly
polished box, which, though very orna- I
mental, is intended to serve a practical I
end as well, jadging from the daintily
etched inscription above it: "Contribu
tions to the campaign fund."
The work of organizing the precinct
clubs is rapidly approaching completion,
and the ontlook seems most promising.
