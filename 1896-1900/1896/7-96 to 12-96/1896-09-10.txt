STOCKTON. Cal., Sept. 9.â The people
of Stockton retired to-night tired of dome
well and happy in the consciousness that
in no way could the Admission day festiv
ities have been better conducted or af
forded more pleasure to their guests. Ab
solutely nothing had been left undone
that would have contributed to the enter
tainment of any of the thousands of visit
ors and no expense had been spared to make
the fetes the grand success they proved to
be. Nothing now is left for the visitors, sur
feited with enjoyment, to do but to wit
ness to-morrow's launch race for the Gov
ernor's cup and then go home.
Last night, or rather early this morning,
all Stockton was awake and on the streets
waiting to receive the trainioads of
Natives that arrived from San Franoisco
about 1 o'clock. The greetings, leceptions,
parade and one thing and another occu
pied another hour or two, and the city did
not become quiet until almost dawn.
Bright and early, however, everybody was
astir and on the way to the channel to be
on hand to greet those who came to the
Mill City by water. The boats arrived at
their moorings about 5 o'clock, and lon^
before 8, the hour set for the formal recep
tion, most of the voyagers had been car
ried off by resident friends.
From 7 o'clock until time for the parade
io start, the throng on the streets steadily
grew larger, and Main street for several
blocks on both sides of tne courthouse
was congested. Several hundred people,
tired out by the fatigue of traveling or
loss of sleep the night before, lay down on
the lawn about the county building. The
grass looked so cool and soft and tempt
ing that its witcnery was not to be re
sisted, and many slept until the blare of
the bands announced the gathering of the
parade.
And such a parade it was! There have
been processions and pageants galore in
the Mill City, but never since the original
settler pitched his tent on the banks of
the San Joaquin has Stockton beheld such
a succession of splendidly nniformed and
interesting organizations. There were
fully 5000 Natives in line, and 30,000 people
lined the sidewalks.
It was a comfortable looking parade, de
spite the assiduous attentions of King
Sol. The women who marched were one
and all robed iv garments of white, filmy
and cool looking, while the men, with the
exception of the Sacramento and Oakland
parlors, were glad in white duck suits
with negligee shirts and straw hats or
yatchting caps. It was a good looking
parade, too. Every face was bright and
happy, and every form was nicely garbed.
As far as appearance went, however, the
Natives from Sacramento won easily. The
uniform adopted was a peculiarly fetching
one, consisting of a light coat of dark
blue material ornamented with double
rows of large white pearl buttons, white
duck trousers, wnite yachting cap and
laundered shirt and collar with a white
necktie. The simple combination of blue
and white caught everybody's eye, and
there is not a Native in the city who does
not concede that the Capital City boys de
serve first prize. The Japanese parasol of
gaudy appearance and multi-colored was
very much in evidence, and those of the
marchers who did not carry one of the
pretty Oriental sunshades had in his hand
an umbrella or parasol of white silk or
carnival-colored cotton.
The literary exercises in the Yosemite
Theater were not as well attended as they
should have been, most of the marchers
and spectators being at luncheon. Mayor
liagga' address of welcome was a gem in

its way. and the response of Grand Presi
dent Henry C. Gesford was equally appro
priate. The oration of Frank Mattison of
Santa Cruz was enthusiastically ap
plauded. Joaquin Miller's song, " '49,"
tbe music of which was composed by
Lelia France, was rendered in public for
tbe first time and was a great success.
The bicycle races at Goodwater Grove
provoked no end of enthusiasm among the
friends and adherents of tne clubs to which
the contestants belong, but the crowd of
spectators was generally athletic. A spill,
in which no one was seriously injured,
and the unexpected victory of several
overlooked men, were the incidents of the
day.
The regatta drew an immense tnrong to
the banks of Stockton channel. Every
body and his brother were there, with
somebody else's sister, and all combined
in cheering the Stockton men, who won

every event in which they were entered.
They not only captured the two barge
races, but gathered in the senior scull
event as well.
Governor Budd failed to act as presiding
judge, because of excessive fatigue re
sulting from his participation in the
parade. Adjutant-General .Barrett pre-
sided in his stead.
Although the banks of the channel were
thronged with people interested in the
regatta, there was no dearth of Natives and
other visitors up town. The sidewalks
were crowded, and companies of joyous
natives paraded the streets io all direc
tions, each knot of marchers being headed
by a band or a drum corps. One of these
assemblages numbered several hundred
persons, principally members of the Sac
ramento parlors, who â men and women â
formed lines stretching from cuib to curb,
and band in hand kept step to the inspiring
strains of the band that preceded them.
After dark the main interest centered in
the carnival oo Stockton Channel and Me-
Leods Lake. It was a fitting finale to the
most successful Admission Day yet cele
brated by the Native Sons. All expecta
tions were excelled. It was a veritable
scene of enchantmentâ* fairy spot in the
midst of an every-day world. Tne thou
sands and tens of thousands that were out
in the afternoon to witness tbe regatta re
turned after dinner in augmented num
bers. They were yt%ll repaid for tbtir
visit. They carried away beautiful im
pressions of this memorable occasion â
mental pictures which will never fade.
Stockton channel is admirably adapted
for such displays. Standing on tbe south
side of the channel, at a point beyond
the depot of the California Navigation and
Improvement Company, there was in
view a bewildering network of lights and
creations in lanterns, torches and electric
lamps as far as the eye could carry. At
Weber Point an electric tower bearing
thousands of colored lamps reared its
lofty head and made a splendid foreground
for the decorations that extended on the
one hand along McLeods Lake and on the
other along the channel into the very
heart of the city, until they faded in the
perspective. Equally beautiful and numer
ous were the illuminations along the
channel southward until the lights were
lost in the distance. .: Â« _-> â¢â ,-. â * â. -â  ~.
The bank? of the channel were lined
with craft of all sorts, temporary seats on
barges and convenient buildings, and
these were crowded by expectant and en
thusiastic thousands. Both sides of the
channel were lined from Center street to
beyond the stakeboat. The fixed lights
varied with tbe colors of the carnival an I
were constantly shadowed and shaded by
colored fires simultaneously act off along
the entire length of the course. A score
of bands and ore estras provided excellent
music from aa many points, while ever
and anon sweet strains came floating in
over the water from the gondolas and
other craft which blackened the bosom of
the harbor. The craft moved by in pro
cession and then floated about at will,
every moment presenting a new picture or
suggesting one.

with a happy party of pleasure-seekers.
Then followed Chinese junks, wicked little
launches, boatbouses, including the in
evitable Polliwog, and craft of all sizes,

were distributed at regular distances, and
gave light and life and color to the shifting

PATERSON, N. J., Sept 9. â Garret
A. Hobart, Republican candiJate for Vic
e to-day made public his letter of
acceptance of tbe nomination by the Ke-
Dublican National Convention at St. Louis.
Mr. Hobart deals with the issues of the
hoar, standing upon the platform of his
party on all issues which it embodies.
The letter follows :
Patebson, N. J., Sept. 9.
Hon. Charles W. Fairbanks and others of the
Notification Committee of the Republican National
Conventionâ Gentlemen: I have already in ac
cepting the nomination for the office of the
Vice-Presidency tendered me by the National
Republican Convention expressed my ap
proval of the platform adopted by that body as
the party basis of doctrine. In accordance
with accepted usage, I beg now to supplement
that brief statement of my views by some ad
ditional reflections upon the questions which
are in deflate before the American people.
The platform declarations in reference to the
money question express clearly and unmis
takably the attitude of the Republican party aa
to this supremely important subject. We
stand unqualifiedly for honesty in finance and
I the permanent adjustmen tof our monetary sys
tem in the multifarious activities of trade and
commerce to the existing gold standard of
value. We hold that every dollar of currency
issued by the United States, whether of gold,
silver or paper, must be worth a dollar in gold
whether in the pocket of the man who toils for
hU daily lm ad, in the vault of the savings
bank which holds his deposits, or in the ex
changes of the world.
The money standard of a great nation should
be as fixed and permanent as the nation itself.
To secure and oDtaln the best should be the
desire of every right-minded citizen. Resting
on stable foundations, continuous and unvary
ing certainty of value should be its dis
tinguishing characteristic. The necessity of a
certain and fixed money value between na
tions, as well as individuals, has grown out of
the interchange cf commoditiesâ the trade and
business relationships which have arisen
among the people of the world with the en
largement of human interests. This necessity
has made gold the financial standard of all
enlightened nations. Other metals, including
silver, have a recognized commercial value,
and silver especially has a value of great im
portance for subsidiary coinage.
In view of a sedulous effort of the advocates
of free coinage to create a contrary impres
sion, it cannot be too strongly emphasized
that the Republican party in its platform af
firms this value in silver and favors the largest
possible use of tnis metal as actual money that
can be maintained with safety. Not only this,
it will not antagonize, but Â«vill gladly assist in
promoting a double standard whenever it can
be secured by agreement and co-operation
among the nations. The bimetallic currency
involving the free use of silver, which we now
have, is cordially approved by Republicans.
But a standard and a currency are vastly dif
ferent things, if we are to continue to hold
our place among the great commercial na
tlons we roust cease juggling with this ques-.
tion and mate our honesty of purpose clear
to the world. No room should be left tor mis
conception as to the meaning of the language
used in the bonds of the Government not yet
matured. It should not De possible for any
party or individual to raise a question as to
the purpose of the country to pay an its obit.2
HON. GARRET A. HOBART, Republican Nominee for Vice-President.
fations in the best form of money recognized
y the commercial world.
The free coinage ot siiver ftt the ratio of 16
to 1 is a policy which no nation has ever be
fore proposed, and it is to-day not permitted
in any mint in the world, not even in Mexico.
It is purposed to make the coinage unlimited
at an absolutely fictitious ratio lixed with no
relation to intrinsic value or p'edge to ulti
mate redemption. With silver at Us present
price of less than 70 cents per ounce In the
market such a policy means an immediate
profit to the seller of silver for which there is
no re^irn, now or hereafter, to the people of
our Government. It means that for each dol
lar's worth of silver bullion delivered at the
mint practically $2 of stamped coin will be
given in exchange. For $100 worth of bullion
nearly 200 silver dollars will be delivered.
Let it also be remembered that the conFe
quences of such an act would probably be
cumulative in their effects. The crop of sil
ver, unlike that, of hay or wheat or corn â
which, being of yearly production, can be
regulated by the law of supply and demand â
is fixed once for all. The silver, which has not
yet been gathered, Is all in the ground.
Drought or other accident of the elements can
not augment or diminish it. It is uot more
than probable that with the enormous pre
mium offered for its mining the cupidity of
man would make an over-supcly continuous,
with the necessary result of a steady deprecia
tion as long as the silver dollar could be kept
in circulation at ail. Under the laws of
finance, which are as fixed as those of any
other science, the inevitable result wonld
finally be a currency all and absolutely fiat.
There is no difference in principle between a
dollar half flat and one all fiat. The latter, as
the cheapest, under the logic of "cheap
money," would surely drive the other out.
Any attempt on the part ot the Government
to create by its fiat money a fictitious value
would dishonor us in the eyes of other people
and would bring infinite reproach upon the
National characrer. The business and finan
cial consequences of such an immoral act
would be world wide, because our commercial
relations are world wide. It is a known fact
that more than 80 per cent of the commerce of
the world is settled in gold or on a gold basis.
Such free-coinaee legislation, if ever consum
mated, would discriminate against every pro
ducer of \vneat, cotton, corn or ryeâ who
should, in justice, be equally entitled with the
silver-owner to sell his products to the United
States treasury at a profit fixed by the Govern
ment â against all producers of iron, steel,
sine or copper, who might properly claim to
have their metals made' into current coin. It
would as well be a fraud upon all persons
forced to accept a currency that stimulated and
at the same time degraded.
In every aspect the proposed policy is par
tial and one sided, because it is only when a
profit can bo made by a mine owner or dealer
that he takes his silver to the mint for coin
age. The Government is always at the losing
end. Stamp such fictitious value upon silver
ore, and a dishonest and unjust discrimina
tion will be made against every other form of
industry. When silver bullion worth a little
more than 50 cents is made into a legal-tender
dollar, driving out one having a purchasing
and debt-paying power of 100 cents, it will be
clearly done at the expense and injury of
every class of the community.
Those who contend for the free and unlim
ited coinage of sliver may believe in all hon
esty that, while the present ratio of silver to
gold is as 30 to 1 (not 10 to 1). silver will
rise above the existing market value. If it
does so rise the effect will bo to make the loss
to all the people : so much less, but such an
opinion is but a hazardous conjecture at best,
and is not justified by experience.
Within the last twenty years this Govern
ment has bought about 460,000,000 ounces of
silver, from which it has coined approximately
430,000,000 of silver dollars and Issued 130,
-000,000 of dollars in silver certificates/and
the price of the metal has steadily declined
from $1 15 per ounce to 68 cents per ounce.
What will be the decline when the supply is
augmented by the offerings of all the world?
The loss upon these silver purchases to the
people of this country has now been nearly
$150,000,000. *
The dollar of our fathers, about which bo
much is said, was an honest dollar, silver
maintaining a full parity of intrinsic value
with gold. The fathers would have spurned
and ridiculed a proposition to make a silver
dollar worth only 53 cents' stand on equal
value with a gold one worth 100 cents.
The experience of all nations coes to prove
that any depreciation, however slight, of - an
other standard from the parity with gold, has
driven the more valuable one out of circula
tion, and such experience in a matter of this
kind is worth much more than mere interest
ed speculative opinion. The - fact that few
gold coins are seen in ordinary circulation for
domestic uses is no proof at all that the metal
is not performing a most important function
in business affairs. The foundation of the
house is not always in sight, but* the house
would not staud an hour if there were no foun
dation.
There is now on deposit in the savings banks
of thirty-three States and Territories of this
Union me vast sum of $2,000,000,000. These
are the savings oi almost 5,000,000 depositors.
In many cases they represent the labor and
economy of years.
Any depreciation in the value of the dollar
would defraud every man, woman ana child to
whom these savings belong. .Every dollar of
their earnings, when deposited, was worth 100
cents in gold of the present standard of weight
and fineness. Are they not entitled to receive
in full, with interest, all they have so depos
ited? i Any legislation that would reduce it by
me value of a single dime would be an intol
erable wroug to each depositor. Every bank
or banker who has accepted the earnings of
these millions of dollars to the credit oi our
Citizens must be required to pay them back in
money not one whit less valuable than that
which these banks and bankers received in
trust.
There are in this country nearly 6000 build
ing aud loan associations, with shareholders
to the number of 1,800,000, and with assets
amounting to more than 000,000. Their
average holdings is nearly $300 per capita,
and in many cases they represent the savings
of men and women who nave denied them
selves the comforts of life in the hope of bains:
able to accumulate enough to buy or build
homes of their own. They have aided in the
erection of over a million of houses, which are
now affording comfort and shelter for 5,000,
-000 of our people.
Free coinage at the arbitrary rate of 16
ounces of silver to one of gold would be equi
valent to the confiscation of nearly half the
savings that these people have invested. It
would be tantamount to a war upon American
homemakers; it would be an invasion of "the
homes of the provident," and tend directly to
destroy the stimulus to endeavor and the com
pensation of honest toil. Every one oi the
shareholders of these associations is entitled
to be repaid in money of the same value which
he deposited by weekly payments, or other
wise, in the.c companies. Ho one of them
should be made homeless because a political
! party demands a change in the money stand
ard of our country, as an experiment or as a
concession to selfishness or greed.
The magnitude of the disaster which would
overtake these and cognate interests becomes
the more strikingly apparent when considered
in the aggregate. Stated broadly, the savings
bank!:, Hie insurance and assessment compa
nies and building and loan associations of the
country hold in trust 15,309.717,381. The
debasement of the currency to a silver basis,
as proposed by the Chicago platform, would
wipe out at one blow approximately $7,083,
-004,820 of this aggregate. According to the
report of the Department of Agriculture the
total value of the main cereal crops In this
country in 1894 was $905,438,107; so that the
total Bum belonging to the people and held in
trust in these institutions whicn would be ob
literated by the triumph of free and unlimited
silver coinage would be seven and a half times
the total value of the annual cereal crop of
the United States. The total value of the man
ufactured products of the country for the cen
sus year of 1890 was $9,372,537,283. The es
tablishment of a silver basis of value as now
proposed would entail a loss to these three in
terests alone equal to 85 per cent of this enor
mous output of all the manufacturing indus
tries of the Union and would affect directly
nearly one-third of its whole population. â¢ â¢ -...'

been paid in gold or Its equivalent are so
enormous, together with the sums due and to
become due for mate, municipal and for other
corporate debts, that if paid in depreciated
silver or its equivalent it would not only en
tail upon our fellow countrymen a loss iv
money which has not been equaled in a simi
lar experience since the world began, but it
would at the same time bring a disgrace to
our country such as has never been equaled
by any other nation which had the ability to
pay its honest debts. Iv our condition, rind
considering our magnificent capacity for rais
ing revenue, such wholesale repudiation is
without necessity or excuse. No political ex
pediency or party exigency, however pressing,
could justify so monstrous an act.
All these deposits and debts must, under the
platform of the Republican party, be met and
adjusted in the best currency the world knows
and measured by the same standard in which
tne debts have been contracted or the deposits
or payments have been made.
Still dealing sparingly with figures, of which
there is an enormous mass to sustain the posi
tion of the advocates of the gold standard of
value, I cite one more case which is officially
established, prefaced by the tiulsm that there
is no better test of the growth of a country's
prosperity than its increase in the per capita
holdings of its population. In the decade be
tween 1880 and IS9O, during which we had
our existing gold standard and were under the
conditions that supervened from the act of
1873, the per capita awnings of this country
increased from $870 to $1036. In those tea
years the aggregate increase of tho wealth of
our country was $21,395,000,000, being 50 per
cent in excess of the increase for any previous
ten years since 1850. and at the amazing rate
of over $2,000,000,000 a year.
The framers of the Chicago platform, in the
face of this fact and of the enormous iucrease
over Great Britain during the same gold
standard decade of our country's foreign trade
and its production of iron, coal and other
great symbols of National strength and
progress, assert that our monetary standard is
"not only un-American, but anti-American,"
and that it has brought us "into financial
servitude to London." It is impossible to
imagine an assertion more reckless and in
defensible.
The proposition for free and unlimited silver
coinage carried to its logical conclusion (and
but one is possible) means, as beiore inti
mated, legislative warrant for the repudiation
of all existing indebtedness, public and pri
vate, to the extent of nearly 50 per cent of the
face of all such indebtedness. It demands an
unlimited volume of flat currency, irredeema
ble, and therefore without any standard value
in the markets of the world. Every considera
tion of public interest and public honor de
mands that this proposition should be rejected
by the American people.
This country cannot afford to give its sanc
tion to wholesale spoliation. It must hold
fast to its integrity. It must still encourage
thrift in all proper ways. It must not only
educate its children to honor and respect the
flag, but it should inculcate fidelity to the Ob
ligations of personal and National honor as
well. Both these great principles should here
after be taught in the common schools of the
land and the lesson Impressed upon those who
are the voters oi to-day, and those who are to
become the inheritors of sovereign power in
this Republic, that it is neither wise, patriotic
nor safe to make political platforms the me
diums oi assault upon property, the peace of
society and upon civilization itself.
Until these lessons have been learned by
our children and by those who have reached
the voting age, it can only be surmised wtiai
enlightened statesmen and political econo
mists will record as to the action of a party
convention which offers an inducement to
National dishonesty by a premium of 47 cents
for every 53 cents' worth of silver that can be
extracted from the bowels of the whole earth,
with a cordial invitation to all to produce it at
our mints and accept for it a full silver legal
tender dollar of 100 cents, rated value, to be
coined free of charge and unlimited in quan
tity for private account.
But vastly more than a mere assertion of a
purpose to reconstruct the National currency
is suggested by the Chicago platform. It as
sumes, in fact, the form ot a revolutionary
propaganda. It embodies a menace of Na
tional disintegration and destruction. This
spirit manifested itself iv a deliberate propo
sition to repudiate the plighted public faith,
to impair the sanctity of the obligation of pri
vate contracts, to cripple the credit of the Na
tion by stripping the Government of the
power to borrow money, as tne urgent exigen
cies of the treasury may require, and in a
word to overthrow all the foundations of
financial and industrial stability.
Noris this all ; not content with a proposition
to ;hua debauch the currency and to unsettle
all conditions of trade and commerce, the
party responsible for this political platform
denies the competency of the Government to
protect the lives and property of its citizens
apalnst internal disorder and violence.
It assails the judicial monuments reared by
the constitution for tne defense of individual
rights and public welfare, and it even threat
ens to destroy the integrity and independence
of the Supreme Court, which has been consid
ered the last refuge of the citizen against
every form of outrage and in-juÃtice. In the
face of serious teril, which these propositions
embody, it would seem that there could be but
one sentiment among right-thinking citizens
as to the duty of the hour. All men of what
ever party who believe in law and have some
regard for the sacredness of individual and
institutional rights must unite in defense of
the endangered interests of the Nation.
While the financial issue, which has been
thus considered and which has come as the
result of the agitation of recent years to
occupy a peculiar conspicuousness, is ad
mittedly of primary importance, there is
another question which must command equal
and serious attention. Our financial and
business condition is at this moment one of
almost unprecedented depression. Our great
industrial system is seriously paralyzed. Pro
duction in many important, branches of man
ufacture has altoÃeiher ceased. Capital is
without remunerative employment Labor is
idle. The revenues of the Government are in
sufficient to meet its ordinary and necessary
expenses. These conditions are not the result
of accident; they are the outcome of the
American economic policy, deliberately eu
acied and applied.
It would not be difficult and would not in
volve any violent disturbance of our existing
commercial system to enact necessary tariff
modifications along the lines of experience.
For the first two fiscal years of the so-called
McKinley tariff the receipts from customs
were $380,807,980.
At this writing, the Wilson tariff act has
been in force for nearly two- full fiscal
years; but the total receipts, actual and esti
mated, cannot exceed $312,441,947. A steady
deficit, constantly depleting the resources of
the Government, and trenching even upon its
gold reserve, has brousht about public dis
trust and business disaster. It has, too, neces
siiated the sale of $262,000,000 of bonds,
thereby increasing to that extent the National
debt. It will be remembered that in no year
of more than a quarter of a century of con
tinuous Republican administration succeed
ing the Civil War, when our industries were
disintegrated and all the interests of business
were more or less disturbed, was the National
debt increased by a single dollar. It was, on
the contrary, steadily and rapidly diminished.
In such a condition of affairs as this it is idle
to argue against the necessity of some sort of a
change in our fiscal laws.
The Democratic party declares for a remedy
by direct taxation upon a selected class of
citizens. It opposes any application to the
protective principle.
Our party holds that by a wise adjustment
of the tariff, conceived in moderation and
with k. view to staDility, we may secure all
needed revenue, and it declares that in the
event of its restoration to power it will seek
to accomplish that result. It holds, too, that
it Is the duty of the Government to protect
and encourage in all practical ways the de
velopment of domestic industries, the eleva
tion of borne labor and the enlargement of
the prosperity of the people. It does .not favor
any form of legislation which would lodge in
the Government the power to do what the peo
ple ought to do for themselves, but it believes
that it is both wise and patriotic to discrimi
nate in favor of our own material resources,
and the utilization, under tho best attainable
conditions, of our own capital and our own
avuilab'e skill and industry. The words of
the Republican National platform on this sub
ject are at once temperate and emphatic It
says of theDolicy of protection:
In its reasonable application it Is Just, fair ana
impartial, equally opposed to foreign conwol ana
domestic monopoly, to sectional discrimination
and individual favoritism. We demand such an
equitable tariff on foreign imports which come
in o competition with American products <v will I
not only furnish adequate revenue for the neces- j
sary expenses ot the tiovernment, but will protect
American labor from degradation to the wage level
of other lands. We are not pie ;ged to any particu
lar schedules. The question ot rat's is Â» practical
question to l>Â« governed by ihe conditions of time
and production. The ruling mil uncompromising
principle is the protection and development of
American labor and industry. The country de
mands a right sfUtlement and then it wants rest.
The Republican party, in its first successful
Na'ional contest under Abraham Linco.'n, de
clared in favor -'of that policy oi National ex
changes which secures to the workingmen liv
ing wages, to agriculture remunerative prices,
to mecnanies and manufacturers an adequate
reward for their skill, labor and enterprise,
and to the Nation commercial prosperity and
independence."
The principle thus enunciated has never
been abandoned. Iv the crisis now upon us
it must be tenaciously adhered to. In 1892,
when by universal consent we touched the
high-water mark of our National prosperity,
we were undtr the same financial systftin that
we have to-dny. Gold was then ihe sole
stundard and silver and paper were freely
uud as the common currency. We hsd
a tariff framed by Republican hands un
der the direction of the great states
man who now loaically leads the con
test for a restoration of the policy
whose reversal brought paralysis to so many
of our industries and distress upon so large a
body of our people. We were under the policy
of reciprocity, formulated by another illustri-
OUI statesman, of the genuine American tyi>Â»\
We may, if we choose to <lo so, return to the
prosperous conditions which existed before the
! present administration came into power.
My sincere conviction is that my country
men will prove wise enough to understand the
issues that confront them, and patriotic
enough to apply safe and sure remedies for the
evils that oppress us. They will not, I am sure,
accept again at their face value the promises
of a party which, under desperate and per.
verted leadership, has so recently dishonored
its solemn pledges; which has repudiated
the principles and policies which have given
it a historic past and the success oi which, as
now constituted, would endanger at home pri
vate security and tiie public saiety and I
disastrously affect abroad both our credit and
good name. And foremast among those who
will decline to follow where the new Dem
ocracy leads will be thousands of men, Dem
ocrats aforetime and Democrats to-day, who
count country more than party and are un
willing, even oy indirection, to contribute to
results so disastrous to our most sacred inter
ests.
The platform of the Republican National
Convention states the party position concern
ing other questions than those herein referred
to. These, while at the present time of
subordinate importance, should not be over- I
looked. The Republican party has always
been the defender of the rights of American
citizenship as kgainst all aggressions what
ever, whether at home or abroad. It has, to
the extent of it 3 power, defended those rights
and hedged them about with law.
Regarding the ballot as the expression and !
embodiment of the sovereignty of the indi
vidual citizen, it has sought to safeguard it
against assault and to preserve its purity and
integrity. In our foreign relations it has
labored to secure to every men entitled to the
shelter of our flag the fullest exercise of his
riph ts consistent w i th international obligation.
If it should be restored to rulership it would in
fuse needed vigor into our relations witn
powers which have manifested contempt and
disiegard not only of American citizenship
but oi humanity itself.
Tne Republican party lias always stood for
the protection of the American home. It has
aimed to secure it in the enjoyment of all the
blessings of remunerated industry, of moral
culture and of favorable physical environ
ment. It was the party which Instituted the
policy of free homesteads and which Holds
now that this policy should be re-established
and that the public lands now vacant and sub
ject to entry in any part of our National ter
ritory should De preserved against corporate
aggression as homes for the people. It realizes
that the safety of the State lies in the multi
plication ot households and the strengthening
of that sentiment of which the virtuous home
is the best and the truest embodiment, and it
will aim to dignify and enlarge by all proper
legislation this clement of security.
If elected to the position for which I have
been nominated it will be my earnest t>nd
constant endeavor, under divine guidance, in
the sphere of duty assigned to mo to serve the
people loyally along the lines of the principles
and policies of the party which has honored
me with its preference.
I am, gentlemen of the committee, very
truly yours, Garret A. Hobart.

LINCOLN, Nebr., Sept. 9.â Mr. Bryan
to-day made public his letter accepting
the Democratic nomination. Its full text
follows:
Hon. Stephen M. White and others. Members of
the notification Committee of the Democratic
National Conventionâ Gentlemen: I accept tho
nomination tendered by you on behalf of the
Democratic party, and in so doing desire to
assure you that I fully appreciate the high
honor which such a nomination confers, and
tho grave responsibilities which accompany an
election to the Presidency of the United States.
So deeply am 1 impressed with the magnitude
of the power vested by the constitution in the
Chief Executive of the Nation, and with the
enormous influence which he can wield for
the benefit or injury of the people, that 1 wisn
to enter the office, if elected, free from every
personal desire except the desire to prove
worthy of the confidence of my country.
Human judgment is fallible enough when un
biased by selfish considerations, and in order
that I m*y uot be tempted to use the patronage
of the office to advance any personal ambition,
I hereby announce, with all the emphasis
which words can express, my fixed determina
tion not under any circumstances to be a
candidate for re-election iv case this campaign
results in my election.
I have carefully considered the platform
adopted by the Democratic National Conven
tion and unqualifiedly indorse each plank
thereof. Our institutions rest upon the propo
sition that all men, being created equal, are
' entitled to equai consideration at the hands of
the Government. Because all men are created
equal it lollows that no citizen has a natural
right to injure any other citizen. The main
purpose of government being to protect all
citizens in the enjoyment of life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness this purpose must
lead the Government first to avoid acts of
affirmative injustice and, second, to restrain
each citizen from trespassing upon tne rights
of any other citizen.
A democratic form of government is con
ducive to the highest civilization, because it
opens before eacu individual the greatest
opportunities for development and stimulates
to the highest endeavor by insuring to each
the full enjoyment of all the rewards of toil,
except such contribution as is necessary to
support the Government which protects him.
Democracy is indifferent to pedigree; it deals
with the individual rather than with his
ancestors. Democracy ignores differences in
wealth; neither riches nor poverty can be in
voked in behalf ot or against any citizen.
Democracy knows no creed, recognizing the
right ol each individual to worship God
according to the dictates of his own conscience;
it welcomes all to a common brotherhood and
guarantees equal treatn Â»- - to all, no matter in
what church or through . -tU forms they com
mune with their Creator.
Haying discussed portions of the platform at
the time of its adoption, and again when your
letter of notification was lormally delivered,
It will not be necessary at this time to touch
upon all the subjects embraced in the party's
declaration.
Honest differences of opinions have ever
existed and will ever exist as to the most
effective means of securing domestic tranquil
ity, but no citizen fails to recognize at all times
and under all circumstances the absolute
necessity for the prompt and vigorous enforce
ment of law and the preservation of the public
peace. In a Government like ours, law is but
the crystallization of the will of the people.
Without it, the citizen is neither secure in the
enjoyment of life and liberty nor protected in
the pursuit of happiness. Without obedience
to law. government is impossible.
The Democratic party is pledged to de'end
the constitution aud enforce the laws of the
United states, and it is also pledged to respect
and preserve the dual scheme of government
instituted by the lounders of the Republic.
The name United States was happily cnosen.
It combines the idea of Nat onal strength with
the idea of local sell-government, and suggests
"An indissoluble union of indestructible
States." Our revolutionary fathers, fearing
the tendencies toward centralization as well
as the dangers of disintegration, guarded
against boih, and National safety ns weil as
domestic security is lo be found In the careful
j observance of the limitations which they Im
posed. It will be noticed that while the United
States guarantees to every State a republican
form of government, and is empowered to pro
tect each State aeainst invasion, it Is not
authorized to interfere In the domestic affairs
of any Stale except upon application of the
Legislature of the State, or upon the applica
tion of the executive when the Legislature
cannot be convened.
This provision rests upon the sound theory
that the people of the Btate, acting through
their legally chosen representatives, are, be
cause of their more intimate acquaintance
with local conditions, better qualified than
the President to judÂ«e of the necessity for
Federal assistance. Those who framed our
constitution wisely determined to make as
broad an application of the principles of local
self-government as circumstances would per
mit, and we cannot dispute the correctness of
the position taken by them without express
ing a distrust of the people themselves.
Economy.
Since governments exist for the protection
of the rights of the people and not for their
spoliation no expenditure of public money
can be justified unless that expenditure is
necessary for the honest, economical and
efficient administration of the Government.
In determining what appropriations are
necessary, the interest of those who pay the
taxes should be consulted rather than the
wishes of those who receive or disburse public
moneys.
Bond Issues.
An increase in the bonded debt of the United
States at this time is entirely without excuse.
The issues of interest-bearing bonds within
the last lew years have been defended on the
ground that they were necessary to secure
gold with which to redeem United States notes
and treasury notes, but this necessity has been
imaginary rather than real. Instead of exer
cising the legal right vested in the United
States to redeem its coin in either gold or sil
ver the executive branch of the Government
nas followed a precedent established by a
former administration aud surrendered the
option to the holders of the obligations. This
administrative policy leaves the Government
at the mercy of those who find a pecuniary
profit in bond issues. The fact that the deal
ers in money and securities have been able to
deplete or protect the treasury, accordins to
their changing whims, shows how dangerous
it is to permit them to exercise a controlling
influence over the Treasury Department
The Government of the United States, wh en
administered in the interest of all the people,
is able to establish and enforce its financial
policy not only without the aid of syndicates,
bat in spite of any opposition which the s jildi
cates may present. To atsert that the Govern
ment is dependent upon the good will or
assistance of any portion of the people other
than a constitutional majority is to assert that
we have a Government in form, but without
vital force.
National Bank Currency.
The position taken by the platform against
the issue of paper money by National banks is
supported by the highest Democratic author
ity, as well as demanded by the interests of the
people. The present attempt of the National
banks to force the retirement of the United
States notes and treasury notes in order to
secure a basis for a larger issue of their own
notes, illustrates the danger which arises from
permitting them to issue their paper as a cir
culating medium.
The National banknote, being redeemable in
lawful money, has never been better than the
United States notes, which stands behind it,

Government and not at the option of the

National banknotes based upon inteiest
bearing bonds.
The Monroe Doctrine.
A dignified but firm maintenance of the for
eign policy first set forth by President Monroe
and reiterated by the Presidents who have suc
ceeded him, instead of arousing hostility
adroad, is the best guarantee of amicable rela
tions witn other nations. It is better for all
concerned that the United States should resist
any extension of European authority in the
Western Hemisphere rather than invite the
continual irritation which would necessarily
result from any attempt to increase the in
fluence of monarchical institutions over that
portion of America which has been dedicated
to republican government.
-
Pensions.
No nation can afford to be unjust to its de
fenders. The care of tlfose who have suffered
injury in the military and naval service of the
country is a sacred duty. A nation which, like
the United States, relies upon volunteer service
rather than upou a large standing army, adds
to its own security when it makes generous
provision for those who have risked their lives
in its defense and for those who are dependent
upon them.
The Producers of Wealth.
Labor creates capital. Until wealth is pro
duced by the application of brain and muscle
to the resources of this country there is noth
ing to divide among the non-producing
classes of society. Since the producers of
wealth create the Nation's prosperity in time
of peace and deiend the Nation's flag in time
of peril, their interests ought at all times to
be considered by those who stand in official
positions. The Democratic purty has ever
lound its voting strength among those who
are proud to be known as the common people,
aud it pledges itself to propose and enact such
legislation b.s is necessary to protect the
masses in the free exercise of every political
right and in the enjoyment of their just snare
of the rewards of their labor.
Arbitration.
I desire to give special emphasis to the plank
which recommends such legislation as is neces
sary to secure the arbitration of differences
between employers engaged in interstate com
merce and their employes. Arbitration is*iot
a new ideaâ it is simply an extension of the
court of justice. The laboring men of the
country have expressed a desire for arbitra
tion and the railroads cannot reasonably ob
ject to the decisions rendered by an impartial
tribunal. Society has an interest even greater
than the interest of employer or employe, and
has a right to protect itself by courts of arbi
tration against the growing inconvenience
and embarrassments occasioned by disputes
between those who own the great arteries of
commerce on the one hand and the laborer
who operates them on the other.
Immigration.
While the Democratic party welcomes to the
country those who come with love for our in
stitutions and with the determination and
ability to contribute to the strength and great
ness of our Nation, it is opposed to the dump
ing of the criminal classes upon our shores
and to the importation of either pauper or ron
tract labor to conipe'e with American labor.
Injunctions.
The recent abuses which have grown out of
injunction proceedings have been so emphat
ically condemned by public opinion that the
Senate bill providing lor trial by jury iv cer
tain contempt cases will meet with, general
approval.
Trusts.
The Democratic party is opposed to trusts.
It would be recalcitrant to its duty to the peo
ple of the country If it recojrnized either the
moral or the legal right of these great aggre
gations of wealth to stifle competition, bank
rupt rivals and then prey upon society. Cor
porations are the creatures of the law and they
must not be permitted to pass from under the
control of the power which created them;
they are permitted to exist upon the theory
that they advance the public weal and they
must not be allowed to use their powers for
the public injury,
Kailroads.
The right of the United States Government
to regulate interstate commerce cannot be
questioned, and the necessity for the vig
orous exercise of hat right is becom
ing more and more imperative. The in
terests of the whole people require such
an enlargement of the powers of the
Interstate Commerce Commission as will
enable It to prevent discrimination between
persons and places and protect patrons from
unreasonable charges.
noitic Railroads.
The Government cannot afford to discrim
inate between its debtors and must, theretore,
prosecute its legal claims against the Pacific
rftilroads. Such a policy is necessary for the
protection ot the rights of the patrons as well
as for the interests of the Government.
Cuba.
The people of the United States, happy in the
enjoyment of the blessings of free government,
feel a generous sympathy toward all wno are
endeavoring to secure like b essings for them
selves. This Â»ympathy, while respecting all
treaty obligations, is especially active and
earnest when excited by the struggling: of
neighboring peoples, who, like the Cubans, are
near enough to observe the workings of a Gov
ernment which derives all its authority from
the consent of the governed.
The Civil Service.
That the people are not in favor of life tenure
in the civil service is evident from the fact
that they, as a rule, make frequent changes in
their official representatives when those rep
resentatives are chosen by ballot. A perma
nent office-holding class is not in harmony
with our institutions. A fixed term in ap
pointive offices, except where tho Federal con
stitution now provides otherwise, would open
the public service to a larger number of citi
zens without impairing its efficiency.
Territories.
The territorial form of government is tem
porary in its nature and should give way as
soon as the Territory is sufficiently advanced
to take its place among the States. New Mex
ico and Arizona are entitled to statehood and
their early admission is demanded by their
material and political interests. The demand
of the platform that officials appointed to ad
minister the government of the Territories
the District of Columbia and Alaska should
be bona fide residents of the Territories or
district is entirely in keeping with the Demo
cratic theory of home rule. lam also heartily
in sympathy with the decoration that all pub
lic lands should be reserved for establishment
of free homes for American citizens.
Waterways.
The policy c! improving the great waterways
of the country is justified by the National char
acter of those waterways and the enormous
tonnage .borne upon them. Experience has
demonstrated that continuing appropriations
are in the end more economical than single
appropriations separated by long intervals.
The Tariff.
It is not necessary to discuss the tariff ques
tion at this time. Whatever may be the indi
vidual views of citizens as to the relative mer
its of protection and tariff reform, ail must
recognize that until the money question is
fully and finally settled the American people
will not consent to tho consideration of any
other important question. Taxation presents
a problem which vi some form is continually
present, and a postponement of definite action
upon it Involves no sacrifice of personal opin
ion or political principles; but the crisis pre
sented by financial conditions cannot be post
poned.
Tremendous results will follow the action
taken by the United States on the money
question, and delay is impossible. The people
of this Nation, silting as a high cuurt, must
render judgment in the cause which greed is
prosecuting against humanity. The decision
will either give hope and inspiration to those
who toil or "shut the door of mercy on man
kind." In the presence of this overshadowing
issue differences of opinion upon minor ques
tions must be laid aside, so that there may be
united action among those who are determined
thai, progress toward a universal gold stan
dard shall be stayed and the gold and silver
coinage of the constitution restored.

BUSY MAJOR McKISLEY.
Delegation* Are 'Pouring in Upon Him
From Every Section.
CANTON, Ohio. Sept, ". 9.â Major Me-
Kinley has been engaged all day in the
not unfamiliar work of writing speeches.
He is to bo visited by ten delegations the
latter part of this week, and 'it. seems' 4 '
likely that he will have to make separate
addresses to each of them. The arrival of
the delegation of Vermonters at 9 o'clock
Friday morning is looked forward to with
uncommon interest. Arrangements are
being made for the Republican meeting to
be held here on the lSth of September. It
is the purpose of the managers to have
this meeting the largest political gather
ing ever assembled in this country. Dele
gations not only from most of the counties
in Ohio are expected, but large numbers
of visitors are said to be : coming from
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Ken
tucky and West Virginia. The speakers
who have finally been fixed upon are:
Senators Thumon and Cullom, Governor
Hastings of Pennsylvania, and Congress-^
man McCleary of Minnesota. Governor
A. S. Bushneil of Ohio is to be the presi
dent of the day.
A local evening paper prints to-night
interviews with Republicans from abont
one-half the counties in Ohio. The trend
of opinion is tbat the Republican ma
jorities in Republican counties will be
largely increased, and that the sound
money Democrats will everywhere out
number the free-silver Republicans.

AUGUSTA, Me., Sept. 9.â The Republi
can State Committee held its third can
vass of the State, and Chairman Manley
has given a summary of the result to a re-
Dorter. He saya:
"We will get from 78,000 to 80,000 vote*
of the Republican party. "We do not
count on a total vote of more than 140,000,
which would be about 7000 less than the
nuraher thrown in the great greenback
year of 1880. We count, the combinea op
position to tne Republican ticket at 60,
-000; that is, we say the Democratic vote
may be 60,000, thus allowine ourselves a
safe majority of from 18,000 to 20,000 votes
as the number from which we shall win."
Mr. Manley said he did not figure on the
fold Democrats, and that it was impossi
ble to tell how they would vote.

mass. While the craft were maneuvering
belore the applauding multitude rockets,
colored lights and other pyrotechnics were
set off from points of vantage, bringing out
in bold relief the foliage along the edges of
the water and the moving masses on the
banks above.
The water carnival was the crowning
glory of the celebration, and gave the vis
itors the greatest possiole enjoyment.
This was evidenced by the fact that they
lingered for hours after the grand march
of the Admission day ball had been called
in the pavilion, and the floating ballrooms
and concert-halls were still giving a ro
mantic touch to the channel long after
midnight.
Late in the evening the grand ball was
opened in the pavilion. Most of the Na
tive Sons and Daughters and their friends
were present and lingered well into the
wee snia' hours. Several dances were also
given by the different parlors, of which
that held by Oakland and Stanford parlors
was the most prominent.
PARADE OF THE NATIVES.
Streets of the Hospitable Mill City
Threaded by a Magnificent
Pageant.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 9.â The parade
started shortly after 11 o'clock. The hrst
two divisions were devoted to notables in
carriages, the marshal and his assistants,
the military escort and the Exempt Fire
men. Following Marshal H. R. McNoble
were Governor James H. Budd and staff,
General M. W. Muller and staff, Colonel J.
J. Nunan and staff and Major GusG. Grant
and staff. The First Battalion of the Sixth
Regiment, preceded by the Sixth Regi
ment band, followed. Several bicyclists
dressed in white and mounted upon white
flyers escorted the Exempt Firemen and
Mexican War Veterans. The thinness of
the ranks of the latter was evidenced by
the fact that they could muster only one
busload. The Pioneers showed more
strongly. Three carriages were taxed to
their utmost capacity to hold the sur
vivors of the darinsr men of '49 who
founded the glorious Golden State.
The City Council and other municipal
officers of Stockton in carriages were fol
lowed by the Exempt Firemen of the
Siate. The aged tire-fighters of San Fran
cisco and Oakland were accompanied by
their owu musicians. Their gay red shirts
at once caught the eyes of the onlookers,
and their appearance was always the sig
nal for a round of applause. The veterans
marched sturdily and well. In the ranks
were men from Oakland, San Francisco
and Stockton.
The parlors of the Native Sons and
Daughters composed the divisions num
bered from 3to 10. Marshal Eugene F.
Bert had charge of the third division,
which was headed by Golden Gate mili
tary band, accompanying Mission Parlor
No. 38 of San Francisco. The banner of
the parlor was mounted upon bicycle
wheels and trundled by a ha f-dozen little
girls, all dressed in white. The vanguard
of the parior was composed of eight trou
badours, whose silent guitars hung use
lessly from the gay ribbons by which they
were attached to the shoulders of the
bearers. The imitation singers made up,
however, for their lack of music by the
lustiness of their cheers. They led the
outbreak whenever a passing parlor or a
group of friends gave the opportunity to
Mission 38 to make the welkin ring with
the sound of its voices.
San Francisco No. 49, a couple of whose
leading members were harnessed to a
little wagon with wooden wheels, such as
our fathers used to make for us to haul
dirt in when we wore pinafores, presented
n pleasing appearance. The members
were dressed in uniform of negligee shirt
and dark trousers and carried Japanese
parasols. Seated in the little wagon were
three urchins, whose ardor was not at all
abated by the hot rays of the sun, which
beamed down upon their unprotected
Leads.
Oakland's representatives marched in
the fourth division, to the splendid music
of the Presidio band. Stanford Parlor
No. 76, whose members delegated the work
of carrying their standards to six giant
men of color, was not uniformed, beyond
the fact that they all wore tennis shoes,
carried canes and wore Fedora straw hats.
Nevertheless they presented a wonderfully
neat and attractive appearance. The gen
tlemen from the Athens of America were
not afraid of having their raiment spoiled
by dust and dirt, and one and all wore
their Sunday clothes. High standing col
lars and laundered shirt fronts may not
be conducive to personal comfort when
marching in a hot sun, but they certainly
impressed the beholders with their neat
ness, particularly after so many negligee
costumes had been seen.
Eden Parlor No. 52 of San Francisco,
marched in columns of fours, two men
and two women composing each rank.
Ail were attired in white and carried
white umbrellas. Rincon Parlor No. 72,
also from SSan Francisco, was also dressed
in wbite and the members were dis
tinguished from their confreres by the fact
that they wore tourist hats of a peculiar
style.
California Parlor No. 1, whose members
too were dressed in white, carrying the
omnipresent Japanese parasol, s lowed up
well, as did Buena Vista Parlor, whose
members marched each with a lady-Jove,
sister or female friend. Golden Gate Par
jar No. 29 aiso made a pleasing appear
ance.
OÂ«kiÂ»nd Parlor No. 50, Native Daughters,
marched and formed a Maltese cross. The
fair dauchters of the City of Churches
were attired in white, with trimmings of
orange hue. They were followed by
Athens Parlor No. 195, which mu*tered
about 100 men. They were dressed in
white linen coats, tennis trousers, negligee
shirts and straw bats, the monotony of
the white being relieved by vivid yellow
streamers, which floated from the tops of
the white silk umbrellas which they car
ried. They also wore belts of the same
warm snade. Yerba Buena Parlor No. 84,
Bay City No. 104 and Niantiu No. 105 com
pjeted the four;h division.
The liftb division was probably the star
of the parade. Most of those who marched
under the direction of Marshal W. M.
Hendersou hailed from the Capital City.
They were preceded by the Sacramento
Militant band, which preceded Sacra
mento Parlor, No. 3. Dark-blue coats of
serge, on which large white buttons, ar
ranged in double rows, showed promi
nently, white linen trousers, straw hats and
white umbrellas, completed me neatest
uniform of the parade. The members
each wore a Prince of Wales reef at the
bottom of their trousers legs, A small
division of the Capital City Wheelmen
followed their neighbor* on foot.

of black, with orange trimmings, was next
in line. Whenever they stopped they
created a sensation. Every member car
ried a cane, in the head of which was fixed
an apparatus, which, when set in motion,
produced a noise resembling the croak of
a frog. When exercising the croakers, the
members industriously gazed at the house
tops, so that it took the onlookers seve
ral minutes to determine whence the
noise came. The Capital boys are well up
in foot movements, and showed to the de
lighted spectators a number of fancy ex
ercises and evolutions. Hesperian Parlor
No. 137, whose members, dressed in white,
were accompanied each by a lady, was the
rear guard of the division.
The sixth division was led by Sequoia
Parlor and its band. The Sequoians were
dressed in red and white and wore Turkish
caps of carmine hue. They also were
accompanied on their travels through
Stockton's streets by the ladies of their
choice, who, robed in white and shaded
by Japanese parasols, bravely underwent
the fatigue of the three hours' march.
Precita Parlor No. 187, accompanied by a
drum corps and neatly attired, preceded
the float of the Goddess of California.
This float was one of the most beautiful
in the parade. Drawn by four white
horses, it represented a conch shell, in the !
center of which was seated Miss Cordelia
Kerrick, daughter of County Treasurer
Kerrick, and one of Stockton's reigning
beauties. The shell was supposed to be
floating in smooth water, drawn by two
swans, driven by a tiny tot, whose infant
hand held bright ribbons to guide the
pretty fowls.
The Capital City Drum Corps, composed
of twenty-five men and a small boy, es
corted California Parlor No. 22 of the Na
tive Daughters. The Jadies were attired
in white and carried parasols of the same
cool color. Dixon Parlor No. 60, whose
members were tastefully dressed, nad with
them a colored mascot w!;o proudly held
aloft the banner of the organization. An
Uncle Sam costume of red and white ver
tical stripes adorned his muscular frame.
Sunset Parlor No. 26 followed Dixon Par
lor, and its members were attired as were
their predecessors.
General Winn Parlor No. 32, accom
panied by the Antioch Silver Cornet band,
occupied a post of honor in the seventh
division. Its members carried tin bear
flass, which they rattled as they marched.
Byron Parlor No. 170, Brooklyn Parlor No.
151 and Halcyon No. 146 were pleasingly
uirformed. They preceded the San Fran
cisco Naval Battalion, the lads of which
marched with military precision, drag
ging after them two Hotchkiss rifles. They
mustered forty five men.
The Amador County parlors led the
eighth division. All were uniformed in
white and marched in couples, a man and
a woman. Their costumes were relieved
by yellow streamers. A float representa
tive of the products of Amador County
followed its living representatives. A
miner at work under a rock, on which
stood a life-bized grizzly bear, was at the
rear of the float, while banked in front
were fruits and other agricultural products
of San Joaquin's neighbor county. Presidio
Parlor No. 194 was fol owe 1 by Tuo umne
Parlor No. 144. A number of the Tuolumne
natives were in a wagon, on the sides of
which were draped strips of canvas on
which was painted, "Tuolumne is with
you. Thirty miles from a railroad. No
apologies."
The miners from Sonora were next in
line, a littie company they, but a brave
one. With their burros and their packs,
their tin cooking utensils, their blankets,
their big revolvers and their patched rai
ment i he Scnorans were greeted with
applause all along the line. Piedmont

Madge Morris Wagner.
Parlor No. 87, Native Daughters, preceded
by the Oakland City band, each member
accompanied by two male escorts, was the
cynosure of ali eyes as the ninth division
came into view. They were followed by
Eden Parlor No. 113 accompanied by its
band. Los Politas Parlor No. 96 of Liver
more, Alameda No. 47, Napa No. 62, San
Jose No. 22 and Observatory Parlor No .177
brought up the rear of the ninth division.
The tenth, and last division, contained
all of the local organizations in line.
Veritas Parior No. 75 of the Native Daugh
ters and Yosemite Parlor No. 21 of the
Native Sons marched together. They, too,
wore the prevailing uniform of white and
yellow, and led off the last division.
The Stockton Native Daughters were led
by Mrs. Ella H. Homage, Mrs. J. W. Ker
rick Jr., Mrs. J. I. Heffernan, Miss Anita
Leadbetter, Miss Utt and Mrs. Mapes, on
horseback. Joaquin Parlor of Native
Daughters, its members robed in white,
followed, preceding a float labeled, "Stock
tonâlBso to 1896," emblematic of the prog
ress the Mill City has made during that
period. The members of Stockton Parlor
No. 7, Native Sons, attired in white duck,
with small vertical stripes of black, and
carrying parasols of the carnival colors,
roomed up in splendid shape. They turned
out probably the largest number of men
of any one parlor, and, next to the Sacra
mento delegation, presented, as a whole,
the best appearance. Following the Stock
tonites were the members of other parlors
of San Joaquin County.
At the extreme end of the parade were a
number of burlesquers, in feminine attire,
preceded by a target, on which was
painted: "We Were Not Born in Cali
fornia."
MUSIC AND SPEECHES.

dresses the Natives In Yo

STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 9. â Imme
diately after the parade the literary ex
ercises began at Yosemite Theater. There
was a good attendance, notwithstanding
the fact that the sightaeers were tired and
most of them were hungry. Ritzau's band
rendered a selection, and at its conclusion
Grand Marshal Nutter, in a f w brief sen
tences, introduced Henry C. Qesford, the
grand president, who coneratulated the
city on the reception it had given to the
Native Sons. Frank H. Dunne, past
president, invoked the divine blessing
A quartet, consisting of Messrs.
Elliott, Brueek, Lane and Parker, Bang
"Forty-nine." A snort address of wel
come was delivered by Mayor Baggs, to
which Grand President Gestord responded.
Grand Orator Frank Mattison of Santa
Cruz delivered the annual oration. He
said in part:
Pioneers, Native Sons and Daughters, Ladies
and Gentlemen: Amid the scenes of rejoicing
that to-day surround us, amid the sounds of
joyful music and the mingled huzzas of thou
sands of voices, amid the warm greetings and
open-handed hospitality of the gathered sons
Â»nd daughters of our great State, it is perhaps
well that we should pause for a few moments
to consider the meaning of all this rejoicing
and reflect upon the events that have made
this grand celebration possible. Less than a
half century ago this great State of ours, an
empire in itself, was a veritable terra incog
nita.
But hidden within our silent mountain
fastnesses was the yellow metal for which men
even endanger their souls, and its discovery
acted as the magician's wan<l to transpose this
scene of pastoral beauty to one teeming with
the fevered life of the miner. The news of the
discovery of gold, like an electric shock, set the
world artre. Throughout the East the me
cbauic at his bench, the blacksmith at his
anvil, the farmer at his plow, the clerk behind
his desk, the professional man in his office,
the merchant in his counting-room, all caught
the "gold fever" and began preparations to
journey to the "New El Dorado."
The men who sat out on that journey either
by the weary way across the trackless prairiee
and deserts or by the longer oceanic route
"around the Horn" were no ordinary men. It
took more than ordinary courage, pluck and
endurance to enter upon a journey to an uu
known land requiring months for its comple
tion and the facing of untold danger ere its
consummation. These men were the pick of
the flower and chivalry of the East; men will-
Ing to endure any hardship and cope with any
difficulties to better their conditionâ not from
sordid desire to accumulate wealth, nor from
love of gain, but from a laudable ambition to
acquire a competency for themselves and
families. There were few impecunious adven
turers within their ranks. Each had to be
possessed of sufficient means wherewith to
equip himself for the journey, and for such
equipment no small amount was required.
True it is, as must necessarily have been the
case, there was a sprinkling of adventurers,
gamblers and the outcasts of society among
themâ men who lived by preying on their
iellows, and who journeyed to the new gold
fields to ply their unholy calling, but these
were few in qumber. The great mass of the
pioneers, as their lives and conduct afterward
demonstrated, were men of the strictest honor
and integrity.
Never had any State such founders as ours.
As the Pilgrim Fathers, who landed on Plym
outh Rock, left their impress on the civiliza
tion of New Englandâ an impress felt until
this day, and probably apparent for all time
so the pioneers founded here a distinctive
Western civilization, which we. their sons and
daughters, are determined to perpetuate.
If too much cannot be saia in eulogy of our
pioneer fathers, what shall we say of those few
brave women who rather than separate trom
husband or family, sharing in the desire to
better their condition, journeyed with them
through barren wilds and trackless deserts to
this fair land? Kthe tongue halts for language
in praise of the hardihood and intrepidity of
our pioneer fathers, it fails entirely in com
mendation of the brave spirit of our pioneer
mothers.
Let us now glance for a moment at the
events that led up to the admission oi the
Btate of California Into the Union. Previous
to the discovery of gold at Coloma in 1848,
only a very few Americans had settled in Cal
ifornia. These were generally hunters and
trappers, discharged or deserting sailors, or
other adventurous spirits who had drifted
into this new country simply because it was
new. The semicentennial celebration held re
cently of the raising of the Bear flag at Sonoma
on Juue 14. 1846, and the raising of the Ameri
can flag at Monterey on July 7 of the same
year, are fresh in our memory and have done
much to attract attention to the American
spirit of patriotism that prevailed among the
earliest of California's pioneers. The revolt
of which the raising of the Bear flag was the
consummation was caused by the decree of
Cammander-General Castro that a stop must
be put to the immigration of American fami
lies and that those already here should b_>
driven out.
After gaining considerable itrength the
Bear-flag movement was dissolved through the
influence of General Fremont and some of the
naval officers stationed at San Francisco, just
two days before the raising of the American
flag at Monterey by Commodore Sloat on July
7, 1846. Indicating the acclaim with which
that event was hailed by the pioneers. Com
modore Montgomery of the sloop -of -war
Portflmouth, then ia San Franoisco Bay, wrote
to Commodore Sloat on Juiy 11, four days
later, that the American flag was waving not
only over Yerba Buena but throughout the
whole country from there north to Sutter's
Fort, and th*t it had been hailed everywhere
with satisfaction on account of the protection
it promised to persons and property.
The Mexican War, begun just previous to
this event, placed California safe within the
protecting arms of the United States Govern
ment Let us now consider the manner in
which the thousands of immigrants who came
into California after the discovery of gold in
1848 conducted themselves, with a view of
observing the intense spirit of patriotism and
love of country that influenced their actions.
Remember, they were far away from home
and kindred, and the influence of the staid
manners and customs of older communities.
Woman, with her gentle and restraining in
fluence, was not among them. They were in a
country having no local government, as ap-
plied to particular localities, yet of themselves I
they devised and enforced laws for their own
governmentâ wise, effective and efficient. Not
withstanding the mad rush ot hundreds to
some newly discovered 'â¢diggings," and the
absence of any law as to the size or possession
of claims, they arranged ail of these matters
without quarrel or difficulty of any nature.
Order, justice and courtesy reigned supreme.
Patches of a few square feet of ground, teemi ng
with the yellow metal for which eacu individ
ual in the camp was striving, were as sacred,
held by mutual consent, as though possessed
by letters patent or held by title deeds.
In no community were people more charita
ble or generous. Nowhere was there less
crime. In hundreds of instances sick, disa
bled and broken-down miners were returned
to their Eastern homes Dy their fellow-miners
with a sufficient "stake" giveu them to keep
want and hunger from their door for many
days. As the population increased, the ne
cessity for a better form of government be
came apparent, and, pursuant to the call of
Governor Riley, the constitutional convention
met at Colton Hall in Monterey, September 1,
1849. The result of the labors of that conven
tion was a constitution better than any of the
other thirty State constitutions then in ex
istence. At the election on November 13 fol
lowing, the constitution was adopted by an
almost, unanimous vote of the people, and on
DecemDer 15 the first Legislature under that
constitution met at San Jose and proceeded in
the framing of laws for the new State yet to
be. For over three months the Legislature
remained in session, and some of the wisest
legislation ever enacted was the result of their
labors. No member of that Legislature had
the collar of the railroad round his neck, or
was there to obey the behest of any political
boss. The people of the State of California
would have fared much belter had other later
Legislatures taken this one for a model and
labored with equal zeal solely tor the good of
the State.
Then began the wrangle as to the proper
boundaries for California and whether or not
If admitted she should be a free or a slave
State; Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Seward and
other great statesmen engaging in the debate.
Gwin, Fremont, Wright and Gilbert, the Sena
tors and Representatives from California, were
knocking at the doors of Congress for admis
sion, that they might enter and take their
seats. Over the admission of no other State
has there ever been such a contention, but
finally the prayer of California was granted/
and on the 9th of September, 1850, the bill
admitting her to statehood was signed by Pres
ident Fillmore. Of the effect this action had
on the history of the Nation the nistorian of the
future may tell us much. Without the aid of
California and her millions of gold who can
tell what the issue of the rebellion might have
been? Of the internal struggles contended
with, of the frustrated attempts to hand the
new State over to the South, I have not time to
speak.
BEAUTY ON THE WATER
Stockton Channel and McLeods
Lake Gorgeously Illuminated
at Night.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 9.â To-night
fully 15,000 people lined the banks of
Stockton Channel and McLeods Lake and
filled the hundreds of water craft that
floated on the water. The scene was like
one in fairyland. Never in the history of
any interior city has such a display been
made. From the waters of the lake and
channel the courthouse, with its thousand
incandescent colored lights, looked like a
brilliant crown, and the huge tower at the
junction of the lake and channel was
lighted with hundreds ot similar lights in
red and blue.
From the courthouse square rocKets and
bombs were sent up every few minutes,
and from a barge on the north bank of
Stockton channel hundreds of rockets and
fancy pieces were set off, until the air was
filled with one blaze of colored light.
From the mills on the south bank of the
same body of water another stand for tire
works had been placed, and here rockets
and candles were sent into midair, with
their stars and globes of falling light all
tending to make the scene above as bril
liant as that upon the water.
Thousands of dollars had been spent on
the laaterna and lights that clotted and
filled the space on the water. Along the
banks of the channel and on tae shores
of McLeods Lake had been strung
myriads of Japanese lanterns, and on the
water the river craft and the many
launches and boats that had been brought
here for this occasion were so beautifully
decorated that even those who had seen
every water carnival before held in the
State were astonished at the lavish dis
play that had been arranged by the car*
nival committee.
Along the south bank of the channel
were the schooners and yachts. They
lined the banks from the sheds of the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company westward to the limits of the
procession on the water. Steamers and
barges were also stationed along this bank
and at intervals huge calcium lights il
luminated the scene.
On the water the picture by nieht was
the most brilliant. Small boats, all decked
with colored lanterns and lights, flitted in
and out. The larger launches and barges
and catamarans were tilled with bevies of
pleasure-seekers and garbed from stem to
stern with every lighting device known.
As the procession wound in and out on
the water, the waiting crowds began
cheering and the cannonading began on
shore. Salutes were fired to the American
flag that was run up on the electric-light
tower at the entrance of McLeod's Lake
and then the procession moved.
The launch that carried Major Frank
Lane and bis friends was one oi the most
beautifully decorated in the line of march.
Changing eiectric-light effects in various
designs had been placed on top of this,
and it towed a large barge that had been
floored over for dancing. While the barge
went down the stream and back again the
band on board discoursed dance-music and
the guests waltzed beneath the blue,
starry skies that were filled with rocket
and redlights.
A number of very attractive floats had
been prepared, but tne chief attention had
been given to the general effect, and this
was most pleasing to the thousands of
people who gathered to witness the dis
play.
Ail along the banks were stations where
red and blue fare was kept burning during
the evening. The boats were so numerous
that it would be useless to attempt to give
an accurate description of each. As they
passed and repassed, turning in and out
along the waters of the channel, the scene
was one that will never be forgotten by
those who witnessed it. Schooners were
lighted from decKs to topmasts; tugs and
launches were trimmed with Japanese
lanterns, while others added red and blue
lire, burned in the bows, to the general
effect.
On one of the floats was a fair daughter

Both of the Amateur
Events.
LATTKEIS FALL TO MILL CITY
BAEGE CREWS.
Senior and Junior Trophies Captured
by the Lccal Teem in Close
Contests.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. y.â From the
time the Admission day parade was over
until long after 2 o'clock to-day the crowd
continued to pour into Goouwater Grove.
The bicycle races between the crack riders
of the State was the magnet that drew the
people from the streets of the city.
P. R. Mott of the Acme Club carried off
most of the honors, he winning both of
the amateur events handily. Mott made
all bis race in the stretch, laying away
during the first part of the contest. When
he wished he easily drew clear off his
opponents and won with lots to spare.
The mile open race was won by Terrill
of the Bay Citys. The result might have
been different had not a collision occurred
and Osen and Edwards been thrown.
They were poing easily when the accident
occurred. Several other riders were in
the mix up, but none were seriously in
jured.
A half-mile for amateurs was the first
event on the card. Mott (R. A. C.) won
easily from Golinda (A. C.) in 1:19 2-5.
Lefevre (A. C. ) won the second heat from
Hirsch (C. C. W.) in 1:171-5. Craft
(A. C.) captured the third heat, with
Hamlia (C. C. W.) second, in 1:201-5.
Leitcb (C. C. W.) captured the fourth,
with Robinson (P. S. It. C.) in the place.
The time, 1:14, was very creditable. Mott
won the linal as he pieased from Craft,
with Llamlin third. It was simply a loaf
tnjt match, as none of the contestants
would set a pace. Mott won by a length
in 1 :22 1-5.
The first heat of the mile open was de
clared off because of the tactics employed
by the riders. No one seemed willing to
race. Terrill finished first, with Long sec
oud, Edwards third ami Byrne fourth.
The time was 2:35 4-5. Despite the warn
ing of the judges, the second heat was but
a repetition of the first. After the spill
Terrill (B. C. W.) won by a length from
Whitman (I* A. <\), Ackerman (P. W.)
third and Byrne fourth. Time, 2:35.
Mott placed the mile amateur handicap
to his credit. He won the lirst heat from
Webb, I. C. C, in 2:18 4-5. May, an un
attached rider, beat Craft, A. C, in 2:22 2-5
in the second heat, and Smith, A. C, won
the third in 2:18 2-5. The final was a
beautiful race. The riders lay closely
bunched to the last eighth, when Mott
drew clear and without an effort wrested
first position from Wyraan, A. C. (95
yards), who eot the place from Webb,
I. C. C. (90 yards), in 2:18 2-5.
The result of the mile professional han
dicap surprised the knowing ones. It was
the best race of the day and tbe pace Â«et
was a warm one. Try as he would, the
scratch man could not overtake the lead
ers and Terrill did not finish inside of the
money. Whitman, L. A. C, who started
on the 70-yard mark, lasted long enough
to win from Long, B. C. W., whose handi
cap was 50 yards. Chapman, O. C. W. (90
yards), was third and Ackerman, P. W.
(85 yards), fourth. The time made was
2:14*4-5.
The regatta on Stockton channel this
afternoon was one of the best that has
ever been held on this coast. The pro
gramme was a long one, but the principal
interest centered in the barge races. Long
before 3:30 o'clock, the hour set for start
ing the races, there were thousands of
people along the banks of tne channel, and
by the time Starter John E. Budd sent off
the first racers on the water there were
fully 10,000 people about tbe water's edge
and on the numerous tugs and launches
that plied up and down to watch the vari
ous events.
The first race was the first heat of the
race for outrigger skiffs. S. J. Pembroke
cf the Alameda Rowing Club, Fred Ayres
of the same Club and J. H. Coughlan of
the Dolphins were tr.e starters. Ayres
caught tbe water first and went away in
great style. He was closely pressed by
Pembroke, but the latter fell behind be
fore reaching the stake boat, and Coughlan
made Ayres work thereafter for first place.
Ayres won the heat, with Coughlan sec
ond, in 12:27.
The second heat of this race was as ex
citing as tbe first. The starters were J.
W. Pembroke, C. C. Dennis and George
Phelan. Dennis got away first and was
never headed. He came in an easy win
ner from Phelan in 12:22, but it was evi
dent that Phelan was saving himself for
the final heat.
This was not called nntil after tbe junior
barge race, and the starters were the win
ners of the first and second place in the
trial heats â Ayres, Coughlan, Phelan and
Dennis. Phelan was the first to catch the
water on the start, and after that the
others could not catch him, thoÂ«gh Dennis
made a gallant effort and made the race of
the day in tbe single events. He headed
Phelan for a time and kept in the lead
until within a Jew hundred yards of the
line, when he managed by the very hard
est work to forge a trifle ahead and won
by a very Jew feet, the prow of Dennis'
boat being within an eighth of a boat
length from Phelan'f.
The junior barge race was the third
event on the programme. It proved, de
cidedly interesting, and brought forth
cheer after cheer from the assembled
thousands as the Stockton crew came in a
winner by five-boat lengths from the South"
Ends. The Pioneer crew, which had been
picked up by the knowing ones for the
winner, was not in the race, and finished
lengths behind.
When the word was given by Starter
Budd, tbe Stockton men shot their boat
ahead like a rocket, and after that they
Lad the race their own way. To the stake
boat the South Ends trailed them, but the
new barge of the Athletic Association is
the best one ever seen on the coast for
turning, and the local oarsmen gained full
three-boat lengths on the turn. When
they staightened away, they went sailing
toward the finishing Tine arid won by live
boat iengths in very fast time, making the
distance in Wul7 2-5. There was much
intere-t in this race, and several were
bitterly disappointed that the Pioneers
did not win.
In the race for junior outrigger skiffs
there were three starters in the first heat â
Will Patch of tbe Dolphin Club, F. J.
Wilson of the Ariels and. W. E. Cole of the
University of California. Cole was looked
upon as the winner of this rnce, and j
started well, but after a time showed that j
be was not an experienced oarsman and I
steered a bad course. The other men beat
liim badly, Wilson winning in 12:25 4-5,
with Fred Patch of the Dolphins second.
The event of the day was yet to follow.
This was the senior barge race. There
were three starters in thisâ the Stockton
(iiants, composed of Tom Carkeek bow, j
, diaries .Spencer forward waist, G. W. â 
Chapman after waist, Carl Davis stroke, !
W. Dolan coxswain; the Pioneers â Fred
Orr bow, George Calloppy forward waist,
1 C. Ochs after waist, J. Clifford stroke, G.
Fitzsimmons coxswain: South Ends â
Harry Uotle bow. Robert Mc-Arthur for
ward waist, Gus Carson after waist, Frank
Dupiissea stroke, George McGrill cox
swain.
j There was considerable delay in pet- j
ting tbe men off on account of the con
duct of the captnin of a steamer. He
blocked the channel for fully a half hour
and it was with difficulty that the mar
shal managed to get him out of the road.
When ttie word was finally given, the
Soutii Ends got away by far the best of
the r-tart. They were a lialf boat length
in advance of the Pioneers anu Giants. !
The Giants were on their metal, and not |
a hundred yards were covered before their
powerful strokes put them on an even |
footing with the South Ender*. Then the
I two crews made a race for the stake boat.
i The Stockton men reached theirs tirst
' and gained on the turn. The South Ends
i were close after them and the race from
the stakeboat to the finishing line was
one of the best ever seen on this coast.
The ores bent like reeds, but under the
powerful stroke of the giants the new boat
I of the local club kept steadily gaining until
within about 500 yards from the finisb
i line.
Tben the South-enders worked in sheer
I desperation, for there were several hun- j
I dred dollars up on them that had been
! wagered by their friends, and they did not
; want to see the championship wrested
1 from them. Ttieir efforts were without
avail, for the big Stockton crew came Id a
boat length ahead after one of the prettiest j
and most exciting finishes that has ever
been seen on any of the waters of this ,
otate. As the local men came m winners j
there were cheers from thousands of 1
throats, and all the whistles on tbe steam- '
ers ana launches that belong here were i
set loose. The time of the winning crew ]
was 9:52.
Next came the senior amgle-sculi event.
The only contestants were Al Brown of
the Stockton Athletic Association and
WilJiam McCansland of the Ariels.
Tbe Ariels had won in the two single 1
events that preceded this and McCausland i
was thought to be the best man on the I
coast, not even excepting Dupiissea, who !
] beat him here last Fourth of July, and so
1 the race was thought by the knowing ones
to be his.
Brown was a surprise to the visitors and |
I to MeCausland. The race was a close one, 1
but the Stockton man managed to win it j
I by a boat length.
The intermediate bargerace was not
pulled off, as the Alameda men refused to
row it. It was almost dark and they did
not care to make the attempt. The race
went by default to the South Ends, who
were ready and willing. The junior single
scull event was not rowed, but will be to
morrow morning. The launchrace is to
take place on the channel.
EARTHLY ANGELS MARRY.
Triple Wedding With Schwein

as the Principals.
Extraordinary Innovation on a Doc
trine That Proclaims for Celes
tial Wedlock Only.
MINNEAPOLIS, Mixn., Sept. 9.â Mary
An:ij Tuttle and J. Schweinfurth were
married here 10-day. She for many years
has presided over his notorious "heaven"
near Rockford, 111., as the leading angel.
The ceremony was performed at the home
of Charles C. Wditney. one of Bcbwein
furth's ardent followers, and the leader's
example was followed by four of his disci
ples in the wedlock of Albert C. Teft to a
sister of Schweinfnrth, and William Wel
don to a Scandinavian girl named Bertha
Oldon. The triple wedding was witnessed
dv the friends and followers of Schwein
furth only. The event is considered ex
traordinary, in that the doctrines of the
sect heretofore liav proclaimed against
earthly marriages. Whether or not a new
section has been added to the faith cannot
be learned.

N. S. G. \V. The day opened fresh and
cool, with a brisk breezu from the Pacific.
Early in the morning crowds began to
form on the principal streets long before

to start. Native Sons were conspicuous in
the crowds and later daring the parade.
They wore uniforms of light tan pongee
blouses, white duck trousers, yellow
sashes, Panama hats, bright Japanese
parasols and large California poppies in
the buttonhole.
With cheering, the clatter of horses and
the shouting of captains the parade
formed at the foot of D street and

cheered. There was also a short but in
teresting talk by C. 11. Anderson, who
was with Commodore Stockton at the cap
ture of iionterey on July 7, 184 G.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon an Immense
crowd of wheelmen gathered at Sixth and
J streets, where the boulevard road races
aronnd the bay to Coronado started. There
was a professional and an amateur race,
and an amateur, J. P. Frazee, broke the
record, and beat the best professional, W.
B. Vaughan, by live seconds. Frazee made
the twenty-three miles in 1:04:50, and
Vaughan's time was 1:12:20. The finish
of the professionals was very exciting.
They swept around tne bay in splendid
style, accompanied by a special train on
the Coronado Belt line, filled with sight
seers.
At the finish W. B. Vaugban, J. Jenks
add Oscar Lane were neck and neck,
rushing down the long stretch of beach
like- a whirlwind. Just before reaching
the tape Vaughan shot ahead of his com
petitors and won. Jenks was three sec
onds later and Lane five seconds.
Vaughan's younger brother was in the
amateur race and made a good run,
coming out first in place and seventh in
time. The winning amateur, J. F.
Frazee, made the run in five seconds less
than Emil Ulbiicht, "the Flying Dutch
man," who won the race lastyear over the
same course.
While the bicycle race was in progress
yachts on the bay filled their sails and
sped down before the breeze, with the
cheers of thousands of spectators. The
race was as pretty as anything that ever
I took place on San DiegoÃay, though the
| wind was not strong enough during the
latter half of the regatta for fast time.
The yacht Angeline, owned by Captain
Alexander Williamson and sailed by
j Captain Nat Nichols, was an easy winner
I in the lirst class, and the sharpie Louise
came out ahead in her class after an ex
citing contest.
To-night the Native Sons' annual ball
at the Second-street armory drew over a
thousand dancers and spectators.

Sequoia boughs, intermingling with tas
tily arranged bunting and streamers,
enlivened everything.
As soon as the excursion train, loaded
with Native Sons and their friends from
all parta of Humboldt County, arrived
this morning a parade was formed. Every
parlor in the district was largely repre
sented. Such an Admission day turnout
has not been seen here for years. The
Humboldt wheelmen and the Arcata Cy
cling Club followed the Native Sons in
the parade. Next came floats and decor
ated vehicles.

preme. Their trace at the outskirts of
the town was the scene of a lively race
meet. Nine events made up the pro
gramme. J. O. Hansen of Alton won the
mile, half-m;le, quarter-mile and rive-mile
dashes. N. E. Yocum carried off the mile
novice and niiie handicap prizes. R. Oh

the Picturesque Mountain
Town.
WEAVE RVILLE, Cal., Sept. 9.â The
picturesque and typical California moun
tain town, ringed around by barriers of
the snow-capped Salmons and the tall
Trinities, did ample justice to Admission
day. The locust-lined streets lent a har
monious background to tbe brilliant ban
ners and unlimited yards of bunting that
had been strung; for when Weaverville
undertakes to do a thine she doea it in
good shape.
la the street parade there were three
floats that attracted unlimited attentionâ
the lirst, a group of California maidens
representing the Native Daughters of the
Golden West; the second, a log cabin,
whose truthfulness of design appealed to
the memory of all the old settlers, and
the third, the shield of California, symbol
ized by Miss Nellie Condon, the prettiest
Kirl in Northern California.
At the close of tbe parade the spectators
gathered around the bandstand in the
plaza, where they were entertained with
literary exercises and music. John Mc-
Murry presided as chairman, while P. 11.
Pau^en, the mining magnate and pioneer
hotel-keeper of Trinity County, acted as
grand marshal.
The programme opened with a song
from a choir, after which Miss O'Neil de
livered an address, dropping into poetry
at the finish. Music by the Weavervilfe
band followed. D. J. Hall delivered an
eloquent speech. Judge T. E. Jones ad
dressed the gathering and Miss Ella Mc-
Murray followed with a thrilliug poem,
'â¢The Ghosts of the Pioneers."
The town was filled with mountaineers,
and the sound of their merriment mingled
with the thunder of the hydraulic giants
at play around the town.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 9.âAdmis
sion day saw the largest crowd of the

Park to view the racing and they saw
some sport in the 2:14 pace that could be
termed real horse-racing. In the second
heat Del Norte, driven by his owner, W. H.

McDowell, fought one of the most stub

REDWOOD CITY, CAL.,Sept.9.â lt was
a great day for Redwood City. So vouch
safed the oldest citizens of the town as
they shook their heads, whitened by the
snows of many winters. Admission day
may have been celebrated witn all the
pomp and enthusiasm of pride and
patriotism elsewhere, but Redwood Ciiy
certainlj was in the swim.
The only four parlors of the Native Sons
in San Mateo County congregated at Red
wood by 10 a. m. They were San Mateo
No. 23, Redwood No. 66, Menlo No. 185 and
Mayfield No. 166. Mu*ic for the occasion
was supplied by the San Mateo and Red
wood City bands.
About 10 a. m. a procession was formed
with the Redwood City band in the lead,
the lour parlors following, then the San
Mateo band, and lastly a long string of
carriages and other vehicles and pedes
trians. The procession started from the
Wahl building and went direct to Fingers
Park, where the pavilion had been pre
pared for the exercises to follow.
Most of the buildings along the line of
march had been tastefully decorated. JThe
handsome public school building, in par
ticular, was ablaze with red, white and
blue bunting, while directly over the arch
way hung the stars and stripes, its folds
waving to the breeze and exciting cheers
of the procession.
At the head of the procession rode Phil
McEvoy, the popular Sheriff of San Mateo
County, on a snow-white palfrey. Phil
had worked very bard to make the occa-
sion a success, and the vast assemblage
that lined the course ol the precession was
so satisfying as indicating the results of
his industry and local pride that his chest
swelled out like a balloon. Yes, without
doubt Sheriff McEvoy W3B the proudest
man in the county.
In the cool aud inviting grove a pavilion
had been draped from one Â»nd to tne other
with bunting; "Old Glory" was omni
present, the Bear flag hung from the
speakers' stand and the ensigns of the four
parlors had been suspended from the raft
ers so as to form the four corners of a
square.
All the decorations and, in fact, the ex
cellent manner in which the whole cele
bration was arranged was due to the tire
less efforts of the committee on arrange
ments, composed as follows: C. D. Hay
ward (chairman), L. J. Frank.Will Plump,
D. R. Stafford, G. P. Hall, F. W. Glenuan,
H. P. iJutts, M. H. Thompson, W. P. Mc-
Evoy, P. Torris, J. Cullen.
The introductory adaress was made by
Attorney Joseph F. Coffey of San Fran
cisco. After eloquently extending a wel
come to the visiting delegates and others,
in his capacity as president of Redwood
City Parlor, the orator outlined the
reasons why tne parlors of the county
had seen fit to hold a local celebration.
"As you know," he said", "the Grand
Parlor of the Native Sons will meet here
next April, and we wished to raise funds
to give them a royal entertainment.
Therefore we decided that Admission day
would be the most fitting time in which
to make a Ptart. lam gratified to tell you
that the gate receipts up till the present
moment are very promising."
Past President H. C. Hall, and now
principal of the Menlo Park Public
School, followed with the address of the
day. It was devoted largely to the history
of the pioneer days of the State, the
stirring episode* in California history,
such as the raising of the Bear flag and"
the admittance of the State into the
Union, and ended with a eulogy of the
order of the Native Sons.
Politicians were present in abundance.
The cares of office and political engineer
ing were lett behind for the time, and the
day devoted to helping entertain the
visitors.
W. S. Witter, ex-assistant United States
District Attorney, and now a candidate
from the Twenty-ninth Senatorial District,
vied with his brother, G. F. Witter, candi
date for Judge of San Luis Obispo County,
in holding the attention of the ladies and
gentiejn-n at the clam-bake at noontime.
Judge HorD.blower was also well to. the
f ron t.
The greatest novelty of the day was
John Church, the boy from Guerneville,
who is 7 feet % inch in height, "in his
stocking feet. John had thought up a
little financial scheme all his own, and
had got another fellow to stand | behind a
screen with all but his head protected, and
let urchins throw eggs at it for twenty-five
cents a half-dozen, while himself stood by
and did the speeling. The young giant
very modestly admitted that he was to get
half the proceeds.
,At 2 r. j*. the sports and athletic games
were started. There were various races
and other kinds of amusement, resulting,
as follows:
100-yard race for visiting members, N. & G.
\V ., won by J. Cronin, San Mateo.
100-yard race for boys under 18, won by E.
De Martini.
100-yard race, free for all, won by M. H.
Thompson.
100-yard race for boys under 12, won by Roy
Ctirran.
100-yard race for married men, won by Dan
Stafford.
100-yard race for fat men, won by W. Ma
lone'y of Menlo Park.
Fiity-yard race for. young ladiesâ Won by
Delia de Martin.
Broad jump, free for allâ Won by Edward
Thompson.
Running broad jump, free for allâ Won by
J. V. Spaulding of May field.
At the conclusion of the games, dancing
was renewed until late in the afternoon.
At 6:30 o'clock there was a _ firemen's
tournament and an open-air concert by
the San Mateo band on Main street. In
the evening a ball was given at the
Alhambra Theater, at which the local
society leaders and belles from the towns
shone in ail their perrection.
VANCOUVER SNUSS LI.
Refuses to Accord an Official Welcome to
the Statesman From the
Orient.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 9.â The city
councils and public boards of British Col
umbia have decided not to give Li Hung
Chang a send-off. Certain wealthy Chi
nese merchants asked officials of this city
to officially meet the. Chinese Viceroy and
read an address of welcome to him. The
City Council, bearing in mind the intense
antagonism to Chinese coolica in the
province, and the fact that an acute state
of the an ti- Mongolian agitation had been
reached, refused to say "How do you do?"
in its official capacity to the distinguished
traveler.
It is a fact that the coolie element in
British Columbia speaks in hostile terms
of their famous countryman. For this, as
d <Â« as Â© ?, other reas ons, the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company, under whose
care Li Hung Chang has placed himself,
has issued positive instructions that, un
less they especially permit it, no one will
be allowed to speak to Earl Li in Van
couver; that under a special escort he will
be taken direct from the train to the
steamship, a distance of 200 yards, and the
curious crowd will be kept at a safe
distance.
In spite of the cold bearing of the city
of Vancouver toward Li Hung Chang Chi
nese merchants have erected a magnifi
cent arch on the Canacian Paciiic wharf,
close to the steamship, and this the Vice
roy will be obliged to pass under.

A lively breeze is blowing, and it is feared
that considerable damage will be done.

TERMS AT DEL MONTE.
Robert N. and George F. Whit
k- ney Cnampion Doubles
of the Coast
They Win From Hardy and Driscoll
in an Exciting Contest â Con
solation Tourney.
DEL MONTE, Cal., Sept. B.â Robert N.
and George F. Whitney are the champion
double tennis players of the Pacific Coast.
They earned this title by defeating Hardy
and Driscoll in the final round of the all
comers tournament at Del Monte.
The court was crowded for over an hour
before play commenced, and when the
game was called every available space
from which a view could be obtained was
occupied. At 3 o'clock the Whitney
brothers appeared on the court and passed
the ball for a few minntes until Hardy and
Driscoll arrived. Both teams were
heartily applauded by their respective
admirers.
Captain O. C. Berryman of the battle
ship Oregon was in the scorer's chair, and
Dr. George Rothganger and Antnony
Ksesar were the umpires.
Robert Whitney commenced to serve,
and through nervousness lost the first
game to Hardy and Driscoll. From start
to finish this set was Hardy and Driscoil's.
They killed their opponents' short lobs
with great speed and accuracy. George
Whitney played his usual steady came,
but his brother fieemed to be considerably
off in his strokes, particularly his drive,
which found the net three times out of
four. The Whitneys made a spurt at one
stage of the set and tied the score at four
all, but Hardy and Driscoll by phenom
enal net play took the next two games and
setâ 6 to 4.
No rest was taken after this set and
play was beeun on the second. The
Whitneys seemed to brace perceptibly,
and, having lost all their nervousness,
soon assumed the lead and by well
time i lobbing and driving ran the act out,
6 to 3.
It was now set all and the result was as
much in doubt as ever. The third set was
the most interesting of all from the fact
that it abounded with brilliant work by
both teams, some of the rallies being long
and severe, the ball passing the net in one
rally more than twenty times. After
coming within at point of winning several
times Hardy and Driscoli lost the set to
_their rapidly imoressing opponents, 9 to 7.
' Each team had been winning on their
service and when in the fourth set tne
Whitney brothers had the score five games
to three and Robert Whitney serving it
seemed as though the match was about
even, but here the winning team went to
pieces and lost the game and finally the
set, 7 to 5.
This made two sets all and after a ihort
rest play was resumed. It was easily seen
that all four players were very tired and
the play had settled down to sure and
steady playing with little or no brilliancy.
The Whitneys lost the first three games
and then seeming to nerve themselves
gave as fine an exhibition of tennis as has
ever been seen on the coast and won six
straight games, set match and double
championship of the coast.
This entities the victors to the four sil
ver cups, two to become their absolute
property and two to cold for a year at
least.
The consolation tournament was played
off this morning, and Nicholson and Gage
carried off the prize, defeating Drs. Decker
and Rothganger in the finals 6 to 2, 6 to 3,
6to 4. The match brought out some good
tennis, and had the naval men been as
fresh as the?r opponents the score would
have undoubtedly been reversed.

THE GARDEN CITY
CYCLERS' CONTEST
An Immense Crowd Watch
Speedy Wheelmen
Racing.
MARRED B7 BAD FALLS.
Bay City Clubmen Tumble on
the Track and Are
Not Happy.
ALL THE EIDERS OUT TO WIN.
Long List of Events Hotly Contested
Makes the Sport Worthy of the
Ciubs Represented.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 9.â The Admis
sion day race meet of the Garden City
Cyclers here to-day drew an immense
crowd of lovers of the sport to the big
three-lap track. The audience was com
posed iargely of ladies, and everyone mani
fested a great deal of enthusiasm, which
spurred the riders to their best efforts. U
was a great day's racing, marred by several
bad falls, though no one was seriously
injured. The Bay City Wheelmen's three
best men entered at the meetâ Hall, Free
man and Harry Terriilâ all took tumbles
through no fault of theirs, and this,
coupled with the fact that the Garden City
Cyclers had totally ignored their club by
not according a single member an official
position on the programme, sent them and
their clubmates home a very disgruntled
set of young men. The San Jose Club at
the last moment asked Haliett of the Bay
Cities to act as announcer, which he did
creditably, and it is expected this will
somewhat bridee over the slirat which the
San Francisco club felt.
No loafing tactics characterized to-day's
racing, be it said to the credit of the
riders. Both the professionals and ama
teurs were out to win, and as a result all
the heats and finals of the various events
were close and exciting.
Probably the most interest in all the
events centered on the mile professional,
Handicap, as among the starters were
some of the fastest sprinters for cash
prizes on the coast. The race was run in
one heat, the riders being Terriil ana Free
man (Bay City). Davis, Jones and Dow
(Olympic), Downing and Cushing (Garden
City) and Willoughby (Watsonville).
The scratch men caught the field in a
lap and a half, and then rested for the
final sprint Downing, Cushing and Ter
rili were in front on the last turn and
stayed that way to the finish, fighting bit
terly every inch of the way.
Jones was thrown in front of the stand,
and Downing, just after crossing the tape,
cut down on Terrill, probably uninten
tionally, ana the big Bay City man went
down with a thump and was badly bruised.
Freeman jumped into fourth place in the
finale, the others being well back. It was
a hot race and one of the most exciting
seen on the San Jose track in many a day.
Those in the press and grand stands close
to the tape thought Terrill got second and
differed with the ludgea' decision in this
.respect.
The one-mile novice was run in five
heats and a final. The winners of the
heats were Ray Hogg, Mountain View:
Al Johnson, Redwood; H. Buffington
Campbells; Dan Murphy, Garden City,
and P. H. Rosenheim, Reliance. George
Thorn of Alameda also qualified by riding
second in the. fastest heat.
Opposite the grand stand on the second
lap of the final heat, Buffington, Rosen
heim and Thorn fell. The other three
fought it out well, Johnson winning in
the remarkably fast time of 2:17. Murphy
took second, Hogg third.
The five heats of the mile scratch, ama
teur, were well contested, a time limit of
2:35 tending to make them speedy. Bates
(Reliance), Kenna (Acme). Tantau (Olym
pic), Decker (Acme) and Wing (Olympic)
won their heats, and Squires (Acme)
Hall (Bay City) and Hardenbrook (Garden
City) qualified by running second in the
three fastest heats.
The final was paced by Julius Smith,
and all started but Tantau. Hall fell on
the second lap, and about this time Decker
thought the pacemaker too slow and
passed him, the rest of the bunch follow
ing. Decker proved the winner in a hot
fipht with Kenna, Wing and Bates, who
finished in that order. The time was the
same as the novice â 2:17, considered very
fast for these men.
The two-thirds mile amateur was run in
six heats and a final. The final heat was
won by Bates of the Reliance Club much
to the delight of his clubmates and the
grand stand, for he is a very popular
rider. Hammond and Shearman of San
Jose rode into second and third positions
respectively, and Squires of Oakland fin
ished fourth. Bates' time was 1 :24 1-5.
During an intermission R. Taylor R
R. Goodrich and A. C. Pillsbury on a
triplet, paced J. E. Wing of the Olympics
for the mile amateur paced record. The
first third was covered in 40 seconds the
two-thirds in 1:23 2-5, and the mile in
2:08 2-5, which is slower than the existing
record. . # Â°
The one-third mile scratch, professional
race, closed the day's sport, and was run
in two heats and a final Freeman had a
bad fall in the first heat, which was won
by Davis of the Olympics in clever style
Downing second, Willoughby third. The
time was 44 3-5 seconds.
Terrill and Jones' appeared for the sec
ond heat, well bandaged from their injur
ies received in the mile handicap,
but otherwise fit to race, and were
well applauded for their pluck. In
the finish at the tape it looked as though
it was a dead heat between the two but
the judges gave the first heat to Jones
The time was 60 2-5 seconds. Dow fin
ished third.

PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 9.-The
California annual conference of the
Methodist Episcopal Church opened this
morning with a large number of ministers,
laymen and ladies in attendance. The
Methodist church was filled with a fine
appearing and intelligent audience. The

Great interest is displayed in all depart
ments of the Christian work upon which
the conference will act. Bishop Cyrus D.
Foss presided.
At 6 o'clock in the morning of the open

ment.
Bishop Foss opened the session with a
short address in which he said: "We
lament the weakness of the church in any
particular locality, but our work as a
whole is going gloriously forward through
out tne world. Thirty years ago people
laughed at us when we gave the figures of
our strength, but since tnen the histo
rians have made the facts known. The
greatest opportunity given to the church
since the days of the apostles is given to
our church to-day. So far as I Know no
body wants to change our doctrine; our
creed is good enough.
"It has been said that the Methodist
church has been depended upon for more
genuine soundness of Christian doctrine
than any other Christian church. Our
preachers are less disturbed than those of
other doctrines, and Methodism is going
down into the next century unshaken.
Let there be nothing less than the salva
tion of the round earth."
The Bishop claimed the credit for the
bishops of the Protestant church and the
Catholic Archbishop of Philadelphia and
for the church of the living God for the
peaceful settlement of the great street-car
strike in Philadelphia not long ago.

FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, or Obio
FOR VICK-PRBBIDENT-
-6ARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EtECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1890.
Here's congratulations to Stockton.
Admission-day weather was just per
fectly Caiifornian.
It i-? admitted now that every Stockton
man is a whole host.
It is a level-headed Native Son who can
wear his hat this morning.
Home protection and international bi
metallism make the best basis for busi
ness and prosperity.
If the average Stocktonian has the big
head to-day no one will ask questions
about how he got it.
The equalizers have fiddled with the
figures and we must both dance to the
tune and pay the piper.
We have celebrated Admission day in
fraternal union ana now we return to
party politics and call the Democrats to
repentance.
By estimates based on. a school census
just taken Chicago figures out a popula
tion of 1,600,000, so the "Two Million Club"
cannot afford to adjourn yet.
Grover's indifference to political parties j
in this campaign would be the biggest i
thing ot the kind in sight were it not for j
the indifference of all political parties to I
him.
When the wage-earner and the producer
go to the polls in November they will bear
in mind that every vote for Bryan and
free silver is also a vote for Bryan and
free trade.
The lone voice of Tom Watson, crying
in the wilderness, pierces the uproar of
the campaign wltn its plaintive wail like
the sound of the whangdoodle mourning
for its nrst born.
Tbe saying of Benjamin Harrison, "Re
publican success never did disturb busi
ness," is one of the truths that business
men reflect on, and they will cast their
votes accordingly.
The assessments of Kan Francisco have
been raised and those of the railroad com
pany have been lowered, and once more
the spoilers ask derisively, "What are you
going to do about it? '
To promote home industry, to increase
our commerce, to maintain our financial
stability, to uphold the Supreme Court
and tbe Federal Government, we must
work with the Republican party and vote
for McKinley.
Bryan in his speech accepting the plat
form of the Silver party gave a great deal
of taffy to the silver Republicans who in
tend to support him, for as there are not
many of them and taffy is cheap he could
afford to be liberal.
From tha increased vote cast in both
Vermont and Arkansas we can see how
great is the interest tne people are taking
in tbis campaign and how necessary it is
for Republicans to organize and bring out
their full strength in California.
"The first duty of a nation," said Mc-
Kinley in a speech at Cincinnati on Labor
day, 1891, "is lo enact laws which shall
give to its citizens the widest opportunity
for labor and the best rewards for work
done.'" It is on that platform the great
champion of protection stands to-day, and
it is for that reason the Republican party
nominated him and the people will elect
him.
For shrill whistling to keep one's cour
age up commend us to the St. Louis Re
public. It has just declared "Tbe Vermont
election is really a verdict for Bryan and
fcewall, as the November returns will
show." Of course it goes without saying
if that is the kind of verdict Bryan and 1
Sewall wish they will be sure to get it, and I
the Republic may be whistling in Novem
ber as merrily as now.
Democratic orators and organs continue
to assert tuat the panic of 1893 was caused
by the demonetization of silver in 1873,
but tbe people will remember that under
tie Republican system of protection the
wealth of the country increased from
$30,000,000,000 in 1870 to $65,000,000,000 in
1890, and that no crash or disaster came
until the free-traders got into power and
began to break down the industries of the
people.
While the Palmer Democrats denounce
the Bryanites for proposing to revolution
ize our finances they propose almost the
same thing themselves. The Chicago
platform is (or silver monometallism and
the Indianapolis platform for gold mono
metallism. Neither of these ' suits the
people or is in accord with the best in
terests of the country. We must have
bimetallism, and that we will get by the
election of McKinley.
BRYAN SNUBS LABOR.
Mr. Bryan formally accepted the nomi
nation of the Democratic party for Presi
dent yesterday. A letter of acceptance
was not needed, however, unless he felt
that it was too good an opportunity to in
sult the intelligence of the American
people to let pass. He employs words
and words and words upon words in call
ing attention to issues that are of com
paratively minor importance, but when he
readies the question of questions â the
question of providing ways and means for
the idle millions to earn bread and
butterâ he passes it by as a matter of no
consequence.
Every one knows that tbe cause of the
existing distress in the walks of the
"common people," as he is pleased to call
workingmen, is the direct and legitimate
consequence of the substitution of free
trade for protection, a measure which re
ceived his hearty support in and out of
Congress. When he reached that ques
tion of questions in his letter of accept
ance he kicked it aside with the remark
that "It is not necessary to discuss the
tariff question at this time."
In the name of all that is jnst and right,
if this is not the time to consider how the
hungry of the land may be fed; if this is
not the time when the voice of idle men is
heard crying for opportunity to work, for
the discussion of the problem of providing
the wage class with the means of self
support, when will ihe time come? "It
is not necessary," Mr. Bryan says, "to
discuss the tariff question at this time. 1 '
Surely labor will find no comfort or en
couragement, in such an utterance. The
needs of labor are of minor importance to
Mr. Bryan. Labor must wait while he
rides his hobby.
The people of the United States did not
wait for an honorable peace more anx
iously during the course of the Civil War
than the wage-earners have waited for the
reopening of the industries in the last two
and a half years, and now comes labor's
self-appointed champion and tells work
ingnien that the question of giving them
opportunity to employ their brain and
muscle is too unimportant a matter to en
gage his attention at this time. The be
lief prevails very generally in labor circles
that the tariff act which Mr. Bryan advo
cated so earnestly upon the floor of Con
gress was the direct cause of the indus
tries drawing their fires and discharging
their employes, and labor had the right
to expect that Mr. Bryan, as a candidate
for President and asking for labor's sup
port, would at least attempt to give the
"common people" reason to hope that if
he were elected he would interest himself
in labor's behalf, but he says "it is not
necessary to discuss" measures for the re
lief of idle labor "at this time." And yet
Bryan poses as the friend of labor!
All over the world every producer is looking
for a viarket for his produce. Every human
being is looking for something to do. Com
mercial and financial success is the highest
achievement of this age. And so we must
have protection or we will have cheap labor.
Cheap labor is never intelligent labor, and all
Americans must be iiitelligent or this Re
public cannot stajid. This is the price we
pay for liberty. IVTw can object to it? â M.
M. Estee.
TWO KINDS OF INDEPENDENCE.
In his reply to the address of the Ohio
Republican Editorial Association, Major
McKinley said: "We must educate the
people that political independence is one
thing and independence of the laws of
trade and nature is another." It will be
understood, of course, that the Chicago
platform was referred to. While that
declaration of so-called principles is a
string of contradictions, evasions and
hypocritical cant, the central thoueht is
that it would be perfectly easy for the
Democratic party to manage tbe affairs of
the Nation quite independent of the laws
of trade and nature, and since Bryan be
lieves himself to be very much wiser than
his generation, no doubt he will try to
set aside the law of gravitation and the
various other "natural causes" unless they
can prove that they come to the ''common
people" independent oi any force that
does not bejjin and end somewhere in ''my
platform," if he is elected.
One of the laws of trade which Major
Mc&inJey recognizes as being an irrevoca
ble edict of the accumulated wisdom of
trade, commerce, agriculture, finance, la
bor and industry is that wide-open shops,
mills and factories to the free admission
of labor is better for everybody than wide
open mints to the free admission of the
silver bullion of individuals is, would or
could be. Of course Major McKiniey in
terprets this edict to mean that it would,
be perfectly useless to open our shops and
mills and factories to the free admission of
labor if our markets were left to the free
admission of the product of shops, mills
and factories of countries whose wage
schedules are 50 to 75 per cent below ours,
and hence it is that he says the first step
in the direction of giving labor a free
chancs- to coin itself into dollars is to pro
tect labor and that which employs it
against hurtful invasion.
To that proposition Mr. Bryan says it
is a matter that is not necessary to dis
cuss until the mints are buckling down to
the work of turning out silver dollars, but
he does not explain how labor is to get
hold of the dollars. On the contrary his
proposition is that American labor shall
not have the dollars unless in a general
scramble with the cheap labor of Europe
it manages to gather a few. Mr. Bryan ia
in favor of throwing open our shops, mills
and factories to the free admission of
labor, but he insists that our markets
shall be wide / open to the free admission
of pauper-labor made goods of other coun
tries. That is to say, he is perfectly
willing that American labor shall have
plenty of work, but it must sell its
product at prices made by pauper labor
and to oblige that to be done he will open
the custom-houses to the free admission
of pauper- made goods and wares.
Strive for a fuller development of your tn
dustries, build up a greater and more profit
able home market for the products of your
farms, advance always that prosperity which
enables the proprietor to pay the highest scale
ofwaqes to the workingmen of America, not
the lowest. Exalt the character of your labor.
Never degrade it. â McKinley.
A FREE-SILVER REPUBLICAN.
Senator Carter of Montana is a free-sil
ver man, ana he is also a good Republi
can. He believes it desirable to open the
mints to the white metal, but not under
Democratic auspices, because that would
mean the introduction of aU the princples
of the Chicago platform into the conduct
of the affairs of the Government, and they
would be a bigger load than silver could
carry, the Senator think.s.
In an open letter to ihe Republicans of
his StatÂ«, Senator Carter says: "I do not
believe la free coinage coupled with free
trade, and I do not believe both can be
successfully established anfl maintained
by our Government. The free- trade policy
will render the establishment of bimet
allism an utter impossibility. AfterlooK
ing the whole situation over, it will be
found that the Republican party has not
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1896.
declared in favor of the gold standard, but
in favor of the restoration of silver."
It will be seen that Senator Carter un
derstands tbe Republican platform to
mean bimetallism, just as every other sen
sible Republican understands it. In fact,
Bryan has declared upon saveral occasions
that tbe St. Louis platform contemplates
the use of both gold and silver without
restriction, only that he thinks his way
the better way. And Senator Carter is
right in line with the other leaders of his
party when he says that bimetallism can
not be accomplished under free trade.
Under free trade foreign industries, with
their pauper-wage schedule, would sup
ply our merchandise markets with goods
and wares, and they would be in position
to demand any kind of money they liked
of us. To be sure, their sales would be
light, because tbe majority of our people
being out of employment would have
money of no kind to spend in the mar
kets, but whatever trade there was would
be done with the kind of money Europe
wanted.
It is amazing that there are people
so blind as not to see how little free
coinage, independent of other countries,
would avail onr wage-earners, more es
pecially if our industries were not running
so as to give them opportunity to earn
dollars. Of course, we could have free
coinage and free trade and keep our in
dustries running pretty much all the
time, but not Unless we put wage-earners
on a parity with foreign wage-earners.
No doubt we could hold our markets
against the world under free trade and
independent silver coinage, but to do it we
should have to reduce the cost of our
goods and wares to what similar articles
made in other countries could be laid
down here for, and as more than 90 per
cent of the cost of our manufactured arti
cles of merchandise goes to labor it will
be seen very readily that labor would have
to submit to wages substantially the same
as are paid in other countries'. Labor
need not be told, for it knows very well
that European wage schedules would
mean European conditions of living.
What labor in this country wants first is a
chance to work at good wages. When
that is secured the money question will
pretty nearly settle itself; or, rather, com
merce will take hold of it and put in a
shape that would strengthen the hand of
labor as well as protect itself.
There is no more virulent or pronounced
free-trader in the United States to-day than
this same William J. Bryan. England has
used every possible endeavor for many years,
through the Democratic party, and such men
as Mr. Bryan as its willing servants and tools,
to get this country to adopt free trade to the
complete ruiix of its industries and its labor,
as we have seen in the past three years, to the
enormous profit of England. Mr. Bryan has
been perfectly willing to be, and is, England's
most obedient servant in that, but expresses
great abhorrence of England's influence in
favor of a gold standard. â Ex-Governor Ham
ilton of Illinois.
THEY ARE NOT REPUBLICANS.
The esteemed San Francisco organ of
candidate Bryan says:
"The Silver party nomination represents
the votes of those Republicana who are not
ready to leave their own party permanently
or to cast their lot with the Democrats or
Populists. Most of them, it may well be be
lieved, do not favor the common princi
ples of either the Democracy or the Peo
ple's party; but they are willing to lay
aside their prejudices and work and vote
for the man who represents one principle
on which they agree with their life-long
opponents."
According to our esteemed contempo- I
rary, as between the maintenance of the !
integrity and independence. of the Fed- |
oral judiciary and the throwing open of j
the mints to silver, the Silver party would
prefer the latter; that as between protect
ing American industries against the low
wage labor system of other countries and
the free and unlimited coinage of silver,
it would take free coinage; that as be
tween holding American labor in the
bonds of enforced idleness and the coinage j
of silver in an unlimited quantity, they
would accept silver coinage; that as be
tween a home market. with a continuous
demand at good prices for American farm
products and throwing open our mints to 'â 
the free coinage of the silver ore of pauper
wage countries, they would ask for the
opening of our mints; that as between a
sound and safe monetary system and the
unlimited coinage of the white metal they
would prefer the latter, and that as be
tween prosperity in all the channels and
highways of commerce, industry and labor '
and wide-open mints for the free and un
limited coinage of silver, they would ask
for the latter.
If, as our contemporary says, the Silver
party is willing to sacrifice every principle
and tradition of Republicanism and over- I
throw the foundation upon which the
Nation stands for the sake of removing
the present restriction upon silver coinage,
then it did right in indorsing the candi
dacy of the nominee of the Chicago Demo
cratic and the St. Louis Populist conven
tions, for Mr. Bryan represents that idea
in all its fullness. But our contemporary
wrongs the Silver party when it says it
â¢'represents the votes of those Republicans
who are not ready to leave their own party
permanently to cast their lot with the
Democrats or Populists."
No Republican is supporting, no .Repub
lican could- support Bryan's candidacy,
and if there is a member of the Silver
party who is claiming to be a Republican
while advocating the election of Bryan be
is an arraDt hypocrite. Republicanism is
as far removed from ; Bryanism as union
ism is removed from sectionalism. The
mission of the Republican party is to
create such conditions of existence for the
American people as shall conduce to the
highest and best good for , every man,
woman and child in all the land. It takes
in the whole range of possibilities and
works to enlarge opportunity for every
one to plant and cultivate a vine and fig
tree for himself, and about him it seeks to
maintain law, order and saiety. The
"one principle" which our contemporary
says the Silver party is contending for is
not a principle of government, it is a prin
ciple of trade and commerce, and to thrust
it upon and make it the paramount func
tion of the Government would be to make
courts, law. Congress and the whole of the
machinery of the Nation subservient to its
purpose. No, there are no Republicans in
the Silver parly nor . in the Democratic
party nor in the Populist part^^HlHH

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
"Many persons who understand music make
the common mistake that such songs as ' Old
Black Joe,' or 'Old Folks at Home,' or 'Old
Kentucky Horne 1 are negro melodits. They i
are no more negro melodies than 'After the
Ball Is Over,' or 'Listen to the Mocking Bird.'
Negro melodies were not written, but like
Topsy 'they Just growed.' Those popular and
justly so songs, 'Tre Old Folks at Home,' etc.,
have been sung by men blacked up to repre
sent negroes for so long fÂ» time people think
they were made by a negro." This is part of an
article recently written by Mrs. Porter-Cole, a
colored vocalist who was one of the original
Fisk jubilee singers. She names as real negro
melodies: "Go Down Moses," "Peter, Go Ring
Dem Bells," and "Nobody Knows the Trouble
I See, Lord." "None of us wished to sing the !
negro melodies," she adds, "and one young
man went home rather than do it. That was

lt*gal and medical professions writing personal
letters to clients and patients of other practi
tioners offering reduced rates and other in
ducements in order that such patrons may be
' brought over to themselves. The methods
] followed by some of our fraternity would dis
grace a peanut-vender. 1 know a piano-
I teacher, a lady of couslderable ability and
i reputation, who actually writes personal,
j urgent letters to the pupils of other teachers,
trying to persuade them to leave their present
j instructors and come over to her. This is up
holding the dignity of the profession, isn't it?
It may be that this method has brought thÂ»
lady a few more pupils, but it will eventually
impair her standing with the people of Detroit.
If I were to presume to offer advice to teachers
; I shotud say: 'Don't try to uuild a reputation
in any way except by honest work.' "
Strange to any, Germany possesses no statue
to Richard Wagner or Franz Liszt. The
Weimar Journal is now proposing that, to cele
brate the tenth anniversary of the death of
Liszt, a statue should be erected to him at
Weimar, where the Liszt Museum already
exists, to perpetuate hia memory. It Is be
lieved that the innumerable pupils of Liszt
would contribute liberally, particularly those
who, like Sophie Menter, have made large
fortunes. It is very possible that the Hunga
rians will protest against Weimar as the site
of the statue, and will point with pride to the
fact that they already have a statue of Liazt in
front of the lloyal Opera-house at Budapest.
It cannot be denied, however, that Germany
has very strong claims on the master, and the
probability is that Liszt's pupils would con
sider Weimar the best Dlace for the erection of
a commemorative statue.
One of the singers promised for the Mapleson
company is JÂ»ne Harding, a French soprano,
who made her debnt two years ago. That was
her first appearance as a vocalist, but she had
been a notorious character for some years, and
on the occasion of her appearance in opera (it
was made in Balnt-Saens' "Phryne") there was
a popular demonstration against her. Vegeta
bles and other mocking tributes were thrown
on the stage and a etorm of catcalls drowned
most of the vocalist's efforts. Jane Harding
went through her part with perfect indiffer
ence to the demonstration and the following
day the papers were almost unanimous in
censuring the public for letting the private
character of the singer interfere with her re
ception as an artist. Since then she has con
tinued to sing and has won some recognition.
She is said to be possessed of a light, trivial
soprano voice, which she uses skillfully enough
to atone for its utter lack of volume.
William Parry, the stage manager of the
Metropolitan Opera-house, is just home from
Bayreuth, where he went to get suggestions
for the stage setting and the stage manage
ment of "Die Walkure," which is to be given
at the Metropolitan next winter. He says it ii
not possible to produce operas in New York as
are done at Bayreuth and Munich. "Wo do
too many operas, and we cannot attend to
each with all the closenesss ana care that they
put into them over there. When I told Herr
Fuchs, the stage manager at Bayreuth, and
also at Munich, that we did twenty-four ope
ras in twelve weeks he did not make any reply,
but be looked at me in a way thet seemed to
say, 'That is another American lie. 1 "
The European opera-houses are beginning to
annouuee their programmes for the coming
season. The Lyric Theatre, at Milan, will re
open in the middle of this month with Mint.
Emma Nevada in "Lakme," and the works to
follow are "The Navarralse.'" with Mme. De
Nuovina, "Mignon," with Miss Simonnet, and
Miss Sibyl Sanderson in "Phryne." The nov
elties already announced for the Scala season
consist of Leoncavallo's "La Boherae," and
Mascagm's now Japanese opera. The Argen
tina at Rome will play for the first time
"Camargo," by De Leve, and the San Carlo at
Naples' will give the initial performance of
Franchetti's new opera, "Pourceaugnac."
Fame came to the recently deceased Pro
fessor Crouch by writing the melodious
"Kathleen Mavourneen," a song founded on a
story written by Mrs. Crawford, whose auto
biography was then appearing in Captain
Marryatfs Metropolitan .Magazine. The sone,
which was written in Londou, had a spon
taneous and lasting success, but Crouch some
times regretted the following line when he
heard Cockney warblers -pronounce it: "The
'orn of the 'unter is 'card on the 'ill." (The
horn of the hunter is heard on the hill.)
Musicians do not seem to be clubable, except
in combination with members of other pro
fessions. The stage, law, journalism, the army
and navy and various other professions have
clubs in most countries, but musicians' cluDs
are generally dismal failures. Tbe London
Truth attributes this to the fact that the
projectors of such clubs have imagined pro
fessors of music hanker after musical perform
ances in their hours of ease. What they really
do desire is to meet possible pupils.
Signor Mancinelli, one of the eondudtors of
the Metropolitan Opera-house during the
grand opera season, has written a cantata,
"Hero and Leander," which will be produced
at the Norwich festival in October. The Prince
of Wales, who is a great admirer of Manci
nelli's conducting at Covent Garden, has
signified his intention of attending the per
formance.
The appearance of Maggie Cline in Newport
drntYiiig-rooms singing "Throw Him Down,
McClusky," and "Ar-rah, Go On," and other
ditties in that line, shows that fashionable
society at the queen of watering-places knows
what real fun is and where to anply for it, but
evidently it is not to Newport society that we
must look for elevation of the art of music.
Legal documents have been taken out making
Earl de Gray, M. H. V. Higgins and Maurice

Grau, who is well known on this side of the

tration of the Metropolitan Opera-house, is
considered to be the best man that could have
been chosen to succeed Sir Augustus Harris.
The Czarâ it is becoming the fashion now to
spell it Tsarâ and the Czarina are to be greeted
in Paris by great musical manifestations. The
authorities have arranged two series of operas
in their honorâ one consisting of the works of
deceased composers and the other consisting
of the works of men who are still alive. Mas
senet, Saint-Saens and Reyer figure on the lat
ter list.
At the Geneva exposition 600 executants

Dresden, perhaps the most musical city in
Germany, has been provided with another
concert-room, to hold about 1400 people and

AN ATTRACTIVE COSTUME.
The belted basque is the latest development
of the waist or jacket effect. This has a circu
lar basque added and may be trimmed in a
variety of ways at the top. The sailor collar
with revere fronts is shown here, being one of
the best-liked models.
The new plaid, striped and embroidered
woolens of the fall are beiug made up into
such waists with very good results, as one
seen, which was worn with collar and a
narrow ribbon belt of turquoise-blue satin rib
bon, matching one of the stripes of several
colors which made the plaid.
Mohairs are made in this way. A plain
brown one was worn with a narrow white
leather belt, the crush collar being of Dresden
ribbon with a white ground.
For early fall, cheviot, tweed and in fact all
the fabrics in wool are charming made up af;er
this model, and will be much in evidence as
soon as outer wraps are laid aside. The first
cool autumn days will show a vast number of
these becoming waists.
They arc made over a fitted lining, the out
side being seamless. The basque or peplum is
cut separate, in circular shape.

HOW TO VOTE.
San Jose Mercury.
by W. a. hawlky.
It sppms to me that voters now should take a
retrospect, .
Four veers ago they wanted "change" and got the
full effect.
The free trade scheme was catching then, they
had to pay so much
For every suit of clothes they bought, and tin and
other such
They voted Cleveland In the chair. He cracked
his whip with ease
And brought down all of the Democrats before
him on tbeir knees;
He whipped them right and left you know with
his old bulldog* ill, -
And then he robbed the Treasury with the Wilson
tariff bill;
He whipped It through our Congress against all
â¢ business sense
And tried to ran oar nation on less money than
expense.
Then of this King called Cleveland they got so
mighty sick â  â  '
They had to hide their blunder, and do It very
slick, 1 , > -- â  â 
And so the Cleveland party In error now does
hatch -v- â â :.??
And foist upon unwary ones "free silver" for a
catch â 
The i ' ye made a dismal failure of free trade as
â¢ you know, .'â¢ . â . â¢
But this "free silver" will, they say, prevent our
overthrow.
They know "free silver" will enrich the silver
king, if won:
Tut- laboring man it cannot help, if factories do
not run.
What good "free silver" e'er can be to those with
naught to do â  â¢ . .
Is more than 1 can comprehend (and no one else),
â  can you ?
To get the silver dollar you will ' readily pre
ceivÂ« j.
You'll give a labor value for whatever you re
. ceive. . â  â 
Don't let the words "free silver" assist them to
bulldoze
You ne'er will nave It (without work) put In your
hands or clothes. .
Vote for protection. Let our mills and factories
open stand.
Start iron and tin and silver mines wherever In our
land.
The coal and lumber Interests, too, and mighty
soon you'll see
Our wheat and wool and cotton move and every
industry.
Let's keep all pauper labor from out our ports,
now free,
And lit our Yankee vessels float onr products o'er
i the sea. \
Our dollar then the world at large will not dis
count 1 cen:,
And L borers all have work to do to make their
homes content.
There'll be no strikes upon our shores, nor other
treat objection
When we elect McKinley to carry out protec
tion. â  _____________ -;v-&--^

The First Railroadâ A large number of au
thorities give it as a fact that the first railroad
in the United States was the one that was built
from the Quincy quarries to tidewater on New
port Creek, already mentioned in this depart
ment, but A. N. Hungerford of this City, in a
letter to Answers to Correspondents, differs
from these authorities. He writes:
The first railroad In this country wa? the one
built on Beacon Hill, Boston, by Silas Whitney in
1807, eighteen years bafore the one from the quar
ries was built. The second one was built, by
Thomas Leiper in 1808 in Kidley Township, Dela
ware County, Pa. The survey and dratt of t:ie
road were made by John Thompson, and the origi
nal map is now in the rooms of the Delaware
County Institute of Science. The road was tnree
auarters of a mile In length and the estimate of
cost was $1592 47. It was used In transporlin?
stone from the Kidiey fiui=rri^B to tidewater on
Hid ley Crfek, a tributary of the Delaware, 'ihe
rails were wood, and the road continued in use for
nineteen years, when it was superseded by Iron
rails and a canaL The first railroad chartered in
the United States was never built. The chant r
was granted in about 1815 and thÂ«> road was to
have run from the Delaware Kiver near Trenton
to the Haritan near New Brunswick.
In 1816 a railroad was built In Western Penn
sylvania on the Kisitiiuinilas Kiver and wus used
to cor.vey coal to Andrew Bos* s salt works below
Â£altsburg. On the 7tU of April, 1823, the KÂ«w
York LeÂ«lslaluie granted a cnarter to tbe Dela
ware and Hudson Â«-anal Company to construct a
canal and ra: iroud from tue coat fields or Pennsyl
vania to the Hudson River ot RonJoui, N.Y. The
canal was completed iv 18-8 aud the railroad in
1829. The latter waÃ sixteen miles long uud ex
t'-nded from Honesdule to Carbondale. In 18V6
the Quincy ranroad wan completed and was four
mites in length, including branches, to haul gran
ite blocks to the port of Newport from the quar
ries. The rails were of wood, but strapped wnh
Iron plates three inches wide and a quarter of an
Inch thick. In 1827 the Mauch Chunk Ilallroad
la Carbon County, Pa,, with four miles of siding,
was built to connect tbe coal mines of the J-ehigh
Coal ana Navigation Company with the Leblgb
Itlver. The road was nlnf miles long. In August,
1830, the Mohawk and Hudson Ra'lroad for thct
carrying of passengers and freight from Albany to
bchenectady, a distance of seventeen miles, was
commenced, and. was opened for travel September
12, 1831. Tlit* charter was granted In 1826. On
the 28th of February, 18".'7, the Maryland Legisla
ture granted a charter tor the construction of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which was the first
one in the United Mutes to carry passengers.
Its construction was commenced July 4,1828,
Charles Carroll of Carrollton laying the corner
stone. The road was opened from Baltimore to
Klliotl's Mills, a distance of thirteen miles, on
May .4, 1830. The Charleston and Hamburg
Railroad was chartered by the South Carolina
Legislature.. December 19, 18*27, the road was
b.gun and six miles were completed in 1829 and
opened for travel December B, 1830. Ine road
was completed a distance of 136 m'.les In Septem
ber, IS3B, then the lonctst continuous road In the
wur.d. All these roads used wooden rails with
iron plates on them, and some roads used such as
late as 1850. In 1833 wrought Iron rails of Eng
lish manufacture were laid down on part of th*
line of the Baltimore and Ohio, before the road
was constructed to I'olnt of Rocks. These rails
were known as the Birkenshaw rails, having been
t)' tented in Kngland by John Birkensbaw on the
20th of October, 1820. The ClarÂ»nc9 rail, an Im
provement on tbe Birkenshaw, was used on the
Allegheny Portage Railroad, 'lhe H rail was first
u>ed on part of the Boston and Lowell road, which
was completed In 1886.

CHALLENGES NCW IN PROSPECT
Catherine Beat the Fawn Over Seven
Minutes and Thus Regains Her
Standing.
The Pacific Inter-club Yacht Associa
tion's regatta yesterday was not altogether
a success. Owing to the light wind that
prevailed in the morning many boats
could not reach the starting point, and in
consequence the California and Corinthian
clubs had to do without come of their
cracks.
Among those who were becalmed in
Oakland Creek were the Lucille, Pilgrim,
Sea Fox, Hope, Surprise, Halcyon, U and
I and the JUillie V. Had they only been
able to cross the bay they might have
made a closer contest in many of the
classes. As it was tbe race for the Mac
donough cup and the prize flags was a
series of the most exciting races ever seen
on the bay. Whether tbe nest yachts won
is still in doubt, as the Elia carried away
her throat halyards and had to retire from
the race; the Sleipner lost her topsail and
for a few moments was almost a wreck
and the Â£olus broke her topmast.
The Harpoon's jibslay carried away,
but Captain Cook had the damage re
paired in a few minutes. In spite of this
handicap the Harpoon finished well ahead
in her class, and was only beaten out by
the Clara of the Corinthians by a short
margin.
The Harpoon was the only entry in the
36-foot class, as the Theiina and Edna did
not reach the starting line in time, and
the Clara waa practically the onJy yacht
in tbe 44-foot class, as the Elia was dis
sbled and withdrew.
The performances of the starters were
as follows:

As will be seen by the above table the

say. in the race for the perpetual chal
lenge cup she beat the Catherine easily.
The latter was built especially to beat the
Encinal's crack, but got the worst of it.
Yesterday she turned the tables and
showed her heels to the cracks.

were the Truant and Catherine in the 30

INCREASED TAXES.
The Merchants' Association Will Prob
ably Knter a Protest Against
the Raise.
At its quarterly meeting to-nieht the
Merchants' Association will probably take
some action in relation to the recent raise
in the City assessment rate. The right of
the State Board of Equalization to raise
the assessment 20 per cent is seriously
questioned. One of the officers said yes
terday :
"There does not seem to be any doubt
that the action of the equalizers is a
proper subject for review by the Supreme
Court. That the courtÃ may take cogni
zance of the action of the board seems to
be settled by the fact that the action of
the Railway Commissioners was made the
subject of legal investigation. Tlie equal
izers seem to stand in much the same
position. We believe that there can be no
official act without some redress. The
equalizers may possibly be right, and in
that case a decision by the court would
settle the question, as It would should it
be found that a rank injustice has been
done."

SHOT AT THE CONDUCTOR
A Chinaman Who Objected to
the Southern Pacific Com
pany's Methods.
Ha Drew His Revolver and Fired
Three Shots at Harry
Enwick.
Harry Enwiclt, the early-morning-train
conductor from San Jose to this City, is
contentedly nursing a few bruises and
abrasions, while offering up thanks that
nothing more serious has happened to
him. Â«
Monday morning Enwick signaled his
train out of San Jose to arrive here at 6:80.
Among his passengers was a Chinaman
who had barely caught it, not haying time
to stop for bis ticket at the office.
The heathen was not aware of the arbi
trary assessment imposed by the railroad
company under the name of "train rates,"
whicn imposes a fine of 10 per cent on pas
sengers wtio do not purchase their trans
portation in advance, and he raised vocif
erous objections to the tax. They were of
no avail, however, and he brooded over
the supposed discrimination to such an
I extent that he was at real highbinder
fighting heat when Lawrence station was
reached.
Enwick bad stepped on the platform, in
the regular course of his duty, and he
gracefully waved his hand to the engineer
to make another start
Bang! bang I bang! was heard, and
the smoking revolver of the Chinaman
poured out three leaden pellets calcu
lated to take tbe last breath out of any
man if properly directed.
Enwick Is athletic, and above all he is
sprightly. The first shot and the whiz of
the bullet warned him of his danger. He
did everything but try to throw the race
in his run for cover, and the last two bul
lets never caught him. The Chinaman
has not been captured either.

FLAGS FLEW FROM
EVERY MASTHEAD
Admission Day Was Pic
turesquely Observed on
the Front.
EXCURSIONS ON THE BAY
A Slow Long-Distance Race Be
tween Two Ambitious Ama
teur Rowers.
WATER FRONT PHILANTHROPY
How a Prisoner En Route to San
Quentin Prison Lost a Deputy
Sheriff.
Admission day was observed on the
water front with the fluttering of bright
bunting from flagstaff and masthead, from
dock to dock. Almost all the shipping in
the harbor flew their national ensigns, and
some of the vessels, especially the State
tugs, were handsomely decorated.
A number of private excursions took
place to different points on the bay, one
of which wasaboird the schooner Roaie H.
It was composed of the Winter Cotillon
Club, and was chaperoned by Assistant
Chief Wharfinger H. 8. Bcott, who was in
turn assisted in his sea-social duties by
Chief George W. Root.
Stephen Gill and Honry Miller of the
water front, who are not professional
boatmen, but who are, nevertheless,
rivals at tbe oar, pulled a Whitehall race
yesterday morning around Alcatraz. The
purse was for $20, with John Krempke as
stakeholder and referee. The two ath
letes struck out pulling a *ood stroke
till they had got about halfway to the
island, when they slacked down, and for
the rest of the contest they evidently
pulled to see who would get in last. How
ever, Miller led his competitor home by
about two miles and claimed the stakes.
Gill entered a protest on the ground that
a porpoise or some big fish fastened on to
his boat's Keel and heid him back.
He says he would not have minded be
ing beaten badly if it had not been his
wedding day and he was afraid his pros
pective bride would prefer the victor, Mil
ler, and refuse to marry a poor oarsman.
However, she was not influenced by
Gill's defeat, and they were spliced just as
soon as he got his boat bailed out. He
will withdraw his protest.
Yesterday afternoon a depnty Sheriff
from some interior county en route with a
handcuffed prisoner to Ban Quentin had
quite a scare at the Tiburon ferry. He
purchased a regular ticket for his prisoner
and ihen was persuaded to buy for him
self a round-trip excursion ticket to
Schuetzen Park from some seller on the
street
When he went to pass through the ferry
eate he was stopped, while his prisoner,
whose tlcuet was all right, was given ad
mission and disappeared down the wharf.
The officer had to return to the window
and procure the proper ticket.
Then came a wild search for the lost
convict. He was supposed to have escaped
and the deputy, with several police offi
cers, soujtht high and low among the
freight sheds and wharves without suc
cess. iTinallv a deckhand informed the
searchers that a man with handcuffs on
was wandering around the boat looking
for the Deputy Sheriff and asking if that
was really the steamer for San Quentin.
So they found him sitting on the outer
end of the ferry-boat enjoying the yacht
race while waiting for his convoy to set
aboard.
The three-masted schooner Hera, Cap
tain G. Anderson, arrived from Okhotsk
Sea with 125,000 codfish. There was no
other vessels in that locality and the Hera
had that fishing-bank all to herself. Her
catch is consigned to the McCallum Fish
ins and Trading Company.
Next Saturday night at 12 o'clock the
tug Vigilant, Captain Randall, will leave
Mission wharf No. 1 for a fishing trip out
side the heads. The party will return
Sunday afternoon. Last trip of the tug a
ton of fish was caught and Captain Ran
dall saya he will bring back two tons this
time.
Williams Had an Outing.
Admission day for Dick Williams, recently
convicted of extortion in the United States
Diitrict Court and now awaiting sentence, was
not altogether witnessed from behind the bars.
Early yesterday morning, accompanied by a
Deputy Sheriff, he left the County Jail, pre
sumably to visit his new attorney, George D.
Collins. He spent some little time there and
then called ou several fnenas who are said to
be greatly interested in having Him remain
silent. The result of these conferences is not
definitely known, but it is said not to have
been satisfactory. Williams will appear before
Judge Morrow for sentence to-day, and it is
not unlikely that something sensational will
develop.

CALLIOPEANS WIN.
A Warmly Contested Baseball Match
at the Presidio.
Something like 500 people graced the
grand stand and bleachers at the Presidio
yesterday afternoon to witness the base
ball game between the Calliopeans and the
Barkers. A number of ladies were pres
ent, and the keenest interest was displayed
in the game.
At the call of time considerable talk was
occasioned by the introduction of Gorman
into the game, whom the Calliopeans
claimed was a professional.
The Calliopean Club being an undefeated
team feared their iirst Waterloo at tbe
hands of the Barkers, but were tinaily
talked into letting the game go on with
Gorman behind the bat. After the first
inning tbe Cailiopeans had things pretty
much their own way. Golinsky in the box
succeeded in fooling trie Barkers from the
first.
The score by innings was as follows:
Calliopeans 4 2 0 3 13 4 3 2â22

DIMOND TO TAKE
THE NOMINATION
Will Enter the Political
Arena Under Buck
ley's Banner.
EULOGIZED BT A FKIEND
His Record as a Supervisor Held
Up as a Criterion of the
Future.
PLEDGES NOB PROMISES MADS
A Novel Idea Suggested for the Com
ing Campaign by John
McCarthy.
Supervisor Joseph Dirnond will accept
the nomination for Mayor tendered him
by the Buckley Democratic municipal
convention on Saturday, and in due time
will appear before the convention and sig
nify his acceptance in a formal manner.
John McCarthy, who is the confidant
and political adviser of the nominee, in the
course of an interview, vouchsafed, in the
absence of Mr. Dimond from the City,
positively that Dimond would allow his
name to be placed at the head of the
ticket put up by the Buckleyites.
"There Is no need of my reviewing the
standing of Supervisor Joe Dimond," said
Mr. McCarthy, "for every one knows his
record as a Supervisor, and knows that he
is as honest a man as ever served the peo
ple of San Francisco. Even his bitterest
political enemies freely admit that there
is nothing to be said against him per
sonally.
"That he has ability is also generally
admitted, and the fact that he has signi
fied his intention of accepting the nomi
nation indicates that he will elve the
duties of bis office proper attention. Thus
the people will have a candidate who is
honest, able and willing.
"I want to add that Dimond is abso
lutely free of pledges or promises, and the
only pledge he will make in accepting the
nomination is to try and give the people
ot San Francisco the best administration
they ever had. There ha 3 been some talk
of the Republicans Dotting up Supervisor
Taylor as a candidate for Mayor. I think
tney could not do better. He would cer
tainly make a good executive, and the
contest between him and Dimond would
prove a most interesting one and call out
one of the largest votes ever polled here.
"Should Taylor be so fortunate as to se
cure the indorsement of his party for chief
executive of San Francisco I would sug
gest that both he and Dimond go fishing
or Hunting or wheeling into the interior
during the campaign and leave the fight
ing to their friends."
In response to a direct question Mr. Mc-
Carthy said that he had spoken to Mr. Di

AMERICAN WOOL

England, as Usual, Reaping the Ben

United States.
The circular of Justice, Bateman & Co.,
wool commission merchants of Phila
delphia, dated September 1, contains a
review of the wool industry which possesses
more than ordinary interest at this time.
It is not surprising that the wool business
during the past month has been the dullest on
record in view of t&e fact that over 75 per
cent of the woolen machipery of the United
States is either entirely stopped or running on
short time. The sales of domestic wool during
the six months following the defeat of the
Dingley bill have been less than any average
month's sales under the McKinley period.
Although the American clip is known to
have decreased over 100,000,000 pounds since
the repeal of the McKiuley duties, the supply
of all kinds is to-day in ecxess of any previous
period. The excessive importations of foreign
raw wool on the one hand, and the decreased
employment for American mills on the other,
have both contributed toward the surplus; the
quantity daily thrown out of v.se by the
closed mills being equivalent to just that
much increase In the supply, and the longer
the mills remain closed the larger the sur
plus becomes. Wool warehouses are full to
bursting with stock for which there is no sale.
The shortage in the domestic clip waÃ con
sidered a sure guarantee of higher prices, but,
owing to the closed mills, there are millions
ol poands of wool, most of which is in the
Territories, for which there are no buyers
or commission-houses who care to take it
unless cash advances are not required.
Wool in London since the McKinley duties
were repealed has advanced over 9 per cent,
while wools of the same kind and quality in
America have declined over 42 per cent. As
ihegold standard lor measuring values pre
vails in both places it is evident that these
price fluctuations in opposite directions are
caused by the removal oi the wool tariff, dur
ing the existence of which prices In London
ior over twenty-five years averaged 51 per cent
lower than for the same k.ind of domestic
wools in the United Slates. Now, instead of
being double the London price, American
wools are 9 per cent below the London price,
nnd are being exported because, for the first
lime in our history, they are unmarketable
here. So much for less than two years of free
iriiie.
What has William J. Bryan to say to this
outcome in view of his speech in the second
session of the Fifty-third Congress on the Wil
ton bill, when he said :
Speaking for myself. It Is immaterial In my
opinion whether the sheep-grower receives any
benefit from Urn tariff or not. lam for frf c wool.
in order that our manufacturers unburdened by a
tax upon foreign wool, uod unburdened by a like
tax upon Home-grown wool, may manufacture for
a wider market.
Relief to the wool market may come through
speculation growiue out of * restoration of
confidence resulting from McKinley's election
and the prospect of the restoration of wool du
ties within a year thereafter, or it may come
through the export of the surplus to Europe.
A movement in this direction has already be
gun.
There has been returned to Europe recently
by one of the largest Massachusetts mills
about 2000 bales of Australian wool and as
much more has been shipped by other parties,
including 500 bales of French scoured wool.
The first to go back to Europe of course wiii De
the imported qualities that are well known
and popular there. It is not improbable, how
ever, mat important shipments of American
wool will also be made, notwithstanding the
disfavor with which experimental shipments
have been received.
The Yorkshire Factory TimeÃ, under date of
July 24, contains the following:
AMERICAN WOOL ON THE ENGLISH M ABKRT.
The Yankee, ever on the lookout for anything
that benefits himself, has a weakness for screech
ing out when in fair fight he is beaten. It appears
that Mr. Claude Meeker, the American Consul, has
reported to Ills Government that the stuff which
the TariKee calls American woo! is not meeting
with that due appreciation which Brother Jona
than fondly imagined It would. Of course, it is not
the material which is at fault: it is the stupid Eng
lish wool sorter who does not knoÂ»- bow to handle
it. The fact that the stuff can scarcely be called
hair, and yet may not be designated wool, and is
thus not at all suitable for the purposes of the
Bradford trade. Is a secondary consideration.
What the Yankee Is annoyed at is that, notwith
standing the manufacturer in America does not see
his way to pay the price asked for by growers, the
English buyer is no less cute. There has been we
are told several hundred thousand pounds of
American wool upon the English market, which
was sent back to the land of the Stars and .Stripes
because the prices asked could not be realized.
THROUGH GREAT FORESTS
The Members of Hoke Smith's
Commission Finally Ar
rive Here.
Traveled iooo Miles by Wagon and
Rode on Horseback Over
Elk Trails.
C. 8. Sargent of Brookline, Mass.. chair
man of the United States commission to
examine and report on the timber regions
of the West, the National parks and reser
vations, arrived here yesterday after a
long tour through what is left of the
American wilderness.
He is accompanied by Professor William
H. Brewer of Yale, General H. L. Abbott
of the Engineer Corps of the United States
army. Arnold Hague of the United States
Geological Survey and John Muir of the
commission.
"1 do not know that I can give you any
startling details regarding our trip or our
purposes." said Mr. Sargent, "but what I
have is at your disoosal. This commis
sion was appointed by the National
Academy at the request of the Secretary
of the Interior. It is the National For
estry Commission, as generally known.
"We have been out since July 2 and
have traveled nearly 1000 miles by wagon
and made long distances on horseback
over elk trails and in all kinds of country.
We have been in the Yellowstone Park, in
the wiid timber regions of Northern Mon
tana Â»Â».nd Northern Idaho, ascended
Mount Tacoraa, Mourn Rainier and Mount
Hood, visited Crater Lake, and also went
to the wild Olympic Mountains in West
ern Washington and Oregon. Our trip
iinally ended by a trip through Del Norte
County and a portion of Humboldt.
"It is now our intention to visit the
Sierras, San Jacinto, San Gabriel and
other places. Professor Agassiz, who is
one of Jthe Commissioners, has not been
able to be with us. Professor Gifford
Pinchot of New York, whose life specialty
has been forestry, is also one of the Com
missioners. He is in the Yosemite now,
where he has been for some time. He will
probably visit Kings River Reservation
and join us a little later.
"When we have finished our inspection
we will make a full report. The forest
fires of the Northwest are so widespread
and the smoke so dense that, there has
been but one time when we could get an
extended view of the country about us.
This was when we were in the Olympic
Mountains."
Mr. Sargent is probably the greatest au
thority on forestry in the United States.
He is the author of a number of books,
and for a long time has stood among the
leading foresters of the world.
Mr. Brewer is the professor of agricul
ture in Yale College. He was from 1861 to
1865 connected with the United States
Geological Survey in California, and
Mount Brewer was named for him. He
ascended Mounts Shasta, Brewer, Whit
ney and other mountains, explored them
and wrote much concerning them. When
he* left here he went direct to Yale, and
has been there ever since.
Professor Brewer said that the prime
object of the commission was to de
vise means to preserve the forests from
fires, theft and other depredations. He
says there are about 19,000,000 acres of
timber in tne West, of which 4,000,000
acres are in California and 4,000,000 in
Oregon.
"I have been constantly surprised dur
ing this trip," said he, "to not<ce the
wanton destruction of the great forests. I
was particularly astonished to notice how
Mount Shasta has been denuded.
"When I ascended that mountain origin
ally in the early sixties there were great
forests about its base and reaching far up
its sides. In recent years this timber has
been cut and burned away. It is so else
where throughout the West. This ought
not to be.
"I also noticed the inroads among the
redwoods, those great forest giants that
ought to be preserved from wanton de
struciion. They ought to be preserved as
a heritage for future generations."
Professor Brewer has not been here for
years, and he is glad to meet his old Cali
fornia friends again.
SONS OF ST. PATRICK.
They Hold Their Twenty Third
Annual Picnic and
Excursion.
The Mutual Alliance Association Re
union Under the Trees at
Scheulzjn Park.
The twenty-third annual picnic and ex
cursion of St. Patrick's Mutual Alliance
Association of California was held yester
day at Schuetzen Park, near San RafaeL
In all that goes to make up a really en
joyable outing this reunion of the Al
liance men and their friends waa a grand
success.
When the excursionists, with the Hi
bernia band, entered the park at 10 a. m.
everything looked propitious for a good
day. The weather was all that could be
desired, and as for the jolly party, there
was so much enthusiasm and eood will in
the air everybody was happy and bent on
enjoying the picnic.
Â£o far as the programme is concerned,
there could have been no excuse for lack
of enjoyment, because the comfort and
pleasure of all present were well attended
to. There was a long list of dances for
those who preferred the waltz or quadrille
to a rost under the trees, and while the
dance was at its height a crowd gathered
in the athletic grounds to wilness the
games and contests. There was much in
terest shown in these events, and no
doubt the handsome prizes had much to
do with the spirit of rivalry manifested
and the zest given the sport as well. The

prize, Charles Campbell; second, Joe Noonan
third, Edwin Bates.

AND APOSTOLIC

City.

HANDSOME CHURCH EDIFICE.
Some Striking Features in the Public
Worship of a Little Known
Community.
Local religious circles are soon to be en
livened by the advent of an evangelist
from London, who will speak to Califor
-nians about the catholic and apostolic
church. This religious body is sometimes
Scene During Service in the Little Church on Eighteenth Street,
Near Dolores.
designated as the "Irvingites," a name
which its members stronely object to as
misleading a:td inappropriate. The cele
brated preacher, Edward Irving, seems to
have been merely a co-worker with other
nonconformists in bringing together a
number of persons whose religious views
agreed with his own. The body disclaims
any pretensions to being a separate
church, and claims fellowship with all
churches having a heirarchical priest
hood.
The local congregation has been in ex
istence for some years and has now a
handsome church on Eighteenth street,
near Dolores. On entering the visitor's
attention is first attracted by the holy
water font just inside the door" The body
of the church is fitted up with pews and
kneeling-bencheH and will accommodate
about 400 persons. The chancel is the
most elaborately furnished portion of the
edifice, being fitted up like that of a prop
erly constrncted Roman Catholic cathe
dral. The lower choir or diaconal step,
occupied by the inferior clergy, is followed
by the presbyteral step* leading to the up
per etioir, which is reserved for the priests
or elders.
Above and beyond the presbytery is the
sanctuary, having a handsome altar, sur
mounted by a tabernacle in which the
sacrament is reserved for the communion
of the sick. Before the altar hangs a lamp
which is always kept burning. To the
left of the altar is the throne of the bishop,
or "angel." the Rev. William M. Pearl,
and round about are cushions upon which
the officiating clerey kneel during the
services. To the left is also a uulpit from
which the gospel is read, and on the oppo
site side stands a lectern for tha reading
of the epistle.
This church has a complete and elab
orate ceremonial, its most imposing serv
ice being the celebration of the eucharist,
which they regard as both sacrament and
sacrifice. In the liturgy of the encharist
are many adaptations from the Roman
missal and from the Book of Common
Prayer, besides other rites of more modern
origin. The vestments used by the offi
ciating clergy are identical with those now
employed by the Roman church, and are
of as rich and handsome materials as can
be procured. The albs and surplices are
I lir.en and the other vestments usually of
I silk or velvet in various colors.
Incense and lights are used at ail the
solemn services, the lights being olive-oil
lamps, no candles being burned. The
solemn offices are all intoned throughout,
the church havine a complete musical rit
ual of its own, different from any other,
except in the case of tne psalms, which
are chanted to tne Gregorian tones.
The church is administered from Lon
don, where are seven magnificent build
ings, corresponding to the "seven churches
of Asia" mentioned in the Apocalypse.
Sixty years ago twelve "apostles" were set
apart as the governing body of the church,
only one of whom is yet alive. He resides
in England, and though not claiming or
exercising pontifical authority, is the chief
ecclesiastical dignitary.
The local church, though its member
ship is not very large, is in a flourishing
condition. A considerable accession to
the roll of members is anticipated, ac one
of the results of the series of meetings
which will be announced as soon as the
evangelist shall have been appointed to
conduct them. The society counts among
its clergy many fine orators, and it is ex
pected that one of the best now in Eng
land will be selected for the work on this
coast. The date of the proposed lectures
has not yet been fixed, but it is thought
they will commence during the winter, or
at the latest in the early part of the new
year.
Clprico Wauta a Pardon.
Edward B. Btonehlll, late Assistant United
States District Attorney, is making an earnest
effort to secure a Presidential pardon for Ferdi
nand D. Ciprico, now serving a sentence of six
years in San Quentin for uttering forged
Cnlnese certificates. Ciprico, ft will be re
called, was a member of the Katzanen-Foss
gantr of certificate manipulators and opium
smugglers brought to justice some months ago
through the untiring effons of Special Agent
Thomas and Special Treasury Agent Moore.
Stonehill has secured some fifty signers to
the petition so far, but hÂ«s not as yet ap
proached ths presiding Judge or the District
Attorney. Unless these two are secured it is
not probable that the petition for a pardon
will be seriously considered by the President.
THE "TAILORS' STRIKE SALE."
An Explanation of What It Is and
What Brought It About.
The "tailors' strike sale" at Summer
field's big store, 924-930 Market street, has
been attracting unusual attention in com
mercial circles as well as with the citizen
looking for bargains. The prices for a
high grade of goods have ranged so low as
to excite curiosity as to how they have
been Drought about. ':
The fact appears to be that a great strike
has been in progress in New York City
among the journeymen tailors for a ion g
time. Thousands of people were involved
during the entire period. The effect was
to bring confusion and loss to the entire
circle of trade in which it occurred.
Goods could not be delivered within the
time limit placed upon the orders, and the
orders were therefore In hundreds of in
stances countermanded. The direct con
sequence of this was . that an immense
quantity of seasonable goods accumulated
in the hands of manufacturers, which
they were, of course, eager to dispose of
at any price in order to get going again in
the regular course of trade, filling new
orders piling in upon them, the strike
having came to an endâ the strikers, it
may be interesting to read again, having
won the day.
Well, Bummerfield's resident agent in
New York saw his opportunity, advised
the bouse here, and they directed him to
buy almost without limit. The result is
that no less than $89,000 worth of the
goodsâ men's boys' and children's tailor
made clothing â arrived a few days ago
and have been put on sale. This explains
the "tailors' strike sale" and how the goods
can be offered at the prices quoted.
CRUSHED IN AN ELEVATOR
Serious Accident to David Mc-
Guire, Driver of a Butcher's
Wagon.
He Thought the Iron Doors in the
Side w a k at the Cafe Zinkand
Would Open.
David McGnire, 1514 O'Farrell street,
met with an accident yesterday morning
that may cost him his life.
McGuire drives a delivery wagou for S.
Solomon, butcher, in the Grand Central
Market, and he has been in the habit of
delivering supplies at the Cafe Zinkand on
Market street. He used the street elevator
to save him the trouble and inconvenience
of carrying the meat downstairs to the
kitchen.
He went there about 6 o'clock yesterday
morning with the visual supoly of meat.
Leaving his wagon on the street he went
round and got to ttie street elevator. He
started it upward thinking that the iron
doors on the sidewalk would open as they
had always done before. Unfortunately
they did not open, and Maguirejwas
crushed against them.
His wagon was noticed outside, and as
he did not make his appearance it was sus
pected that something was wrong. A
hurried search revealed the true state of
matters and McGuire was quickly released
from what may prove his death trap. He
was unconscious and it was thought he
was dying.
The patrol wagon was summoned and
the unconscious man was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital. Dr. Thompson found a
fracture at the base of the skull, his right
side was contused and he had sustained
severe internal injuries, although no bones
appeared to be broken.
Dr. Somers, ex-police surgeon, has spe
cial charge of the case.
A Talk on Mining.
On Friday evening, September 11, a free pub
lic lecture will be given on gold mining in Cali
fornia, under the auspices of the Gold Mining
Exchange, at the Academy of Sciences Hall,
81i> Market street, between Fourth and Fifth.
At er some introductory remarks by Gen
eral Walter Turnbull, president of the ex
change, Augustus J. Bowie, M.E., will discuss
the process ol mining to-day as compared with
old-tirae methods, and Alfred Kopp. OLE.,
superintendent of Selby Smelting Works, will
speak on new and improved processes for re
ducing ores and saving Wie precious metal. Both
ladies and gentlemen are invited to attend
this lecture, whicn is given without any
charge for admission
Jurisdiction Involved.
A suit of peculiar interest is now being
heard in the United States Ciruit Court. It
seems that some months ago W. J. Virgin and
others of Ashland, Oregon, Instituted legal
proceedings aeainst Kdwin M. Corliss, in the
matter of certain water rights claimed by the
latter. The action came up for hearing before
Judge McKenna yesterday on a motion ol de
fendant s attorneys to nonsuit, on the ground
of no jurisdiction. Counsel lor both Hides
made able arguments, at the conclusion of
which Judge McKenna toot the matter under
advisement. He will probably render a de
cision to-day.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
HONEYMOON TRIP
ON STOLEN BIKES
It Was Planned by W. H.
Smith and Adeiie
Laura Tucker.
NIPPED IN THE BUD.
Just as They Were Going to Be
Married Smith Was
Arrested.
GRAND LARCENY THE CHARGE.
The Girl, Who Is Only Fourteen Years
of Age, Will Be Sent to Her
Parents in Santa Clara.
Instead of getting married and spending
their honeymoon on a bicycle tour, Wil
liam H. Smith, alias D. Banks, is in "the
tanks" at the City Prison and Adeiie
Laura Tucker, a pretty girl, 14 years of
age, is in the matron's room, and will be
sent home to her parents in Santa Clara.
What brought about this unhappy state
of affairs was a dispatch that Cnief Crow
ley received on Monday from Chief Minto
of Portland, Or. The dispatch asked him
to arrest D. Banks, a passenger by tne
steamer from Portland, and secure two bi
cycles he had stolen from the Overman
Wheel Company as evidence against him.
Detectives Gibson and Wren were de
tailed on the case, and when they got to
the wharf they found the steamer had
arrived and her passengers had all disem
barked. The two bicycles were, however,
on board. One of Pinkerton's men was
also on the wharf looking for Banks, as
they had received a dispatch from the
Overman Wneel Company to arrest him.
They remained on watch all day Mon
day and Tuesday, in the hope that Banks
would call lor the bicyclss. Tuesday after
noon an expressman drove up to the
steamer with an order for the wheels. The
detectives spoke to him, and he said he
had instructions to take them to a lodg
in '.-house at Twelfth and Franklin streets,
Oakland.
The expressman got the bicycles and
tne three detectives crossed the bay with
him. On reaching Oakland the Pinkerton
man drove the wa^on to the lodging-house,
and Gibson and Wren took the cars,
reaching there, as arranged, as the wagon
drove up to the door. A young man came
out and gave a receipt for the two wheels
and was promptly placed under arrest.
He denied knowing anythiut; about the
wheels. Then he said he bought them
from a man on Market street, San Fran
cisco, and produced a bogus bill of sale.
He also denied being D. Banks, and said
his name was W. H. Smith. He showed
a letter of recommendation from the Pa
cific Manufacturing Company of Santa
Clara, where he i;ad been employed. The
bluff did not work, and he finally ad
mitted having stolen the two bicycles.
A young jzirl was with him and he told
the detectives she was his wife. They
questioned her and she said she was not
his wife, but they were to be married that
afternoon. She showed a marriage
license, which Smith had procured in Oak
land. It gave his name as William H.
Smith, age 22, and hers as Adeiie Laura
Tucker, age 19. She admitted that she
was only 14 years of age. She had known
Smith when be worked for the Pacific
Manufacturing Company. He telegraphed
to her on Monday to come on to Oakland
and they would get married.
She started Tuesday morning without
telling her parents and reached Oakland
by the noon train. They were just pre
paring to go to a clergyman to get mar
ried when the detectives arrived.
Smith and the gir! and the two bicycles
were taken to the City Prison. He was
locked up in "the tanks" and she was
placed in the matron's room.
She said she could ride a bicycle nicely,
and so could Smith, and as soon as they
got married they were to start East on
their bicycles, but she did not know their
destination.
Chief Crowley yesterday morning wired
to Chief Kidward of San Jose, who had
been making inquiries about the girl, that
she was in the City Prison, and Kidward
replied that he would take her home
to-day.
Chief Minto of "Portland was also noti
fied of Smith's, alias Banks', arrest, and
he sent a reply that an officer would leave
at once to take him back there.
THE SPANISH MAIN.
. - I
tlvely R*<cÂ«nt Date.
We write and talk glibly enough of the
Spanish Main, but when did the phrase
first come into use, and what was its ex
act geographical significance? The prev
alent idea, borrowed, we take it, from the
delightful romance of "Westward Ho!"
seems to be that the phrase was in com
mon use among the Elizabethan sailors to
signify that part of the great American
continent on which the Spaniards had ef
fected a settlement when we first broke
into the Caribbean Sea; that is to say,
from Vera Cruz, in the Gulf of Mexico, to
the delta of the Orinoco. But we cannot
find that the phrase was in use at that
time. In the pages of Hakluyt we read
of the Main, of the Firm Land (which is,
of course, a literal translation of the
Spanish term "tierra firrna"), of "the
Mainland Coast, of the Coast, of the In
dies or of the West Indies; but of the
Spanish Main we have nowhere read.
Nor have we been able to find it m the
writers of the next century* Dampier
does not use it, nor Lionel Wafer, nor the
translator ot Exquemelm's "De America
enÂ«cue Zee-Roovers" ; it is not to be found
in Morgan's official reports of his bucca
neering exploits, nor in Rongrose's nar
rative, nor in Sharp's. In the map en
graved for Dampier's "Voyages" (1729)
the term Firm Lund is employed to 'Jesig
nate the territory now occupied by the
republics of Venezuela and Colombia.
The original Tierra Firma of the Span
iards, according to Ulloa, included only
the provinces of Veragua, Panama anil
Darien, with the city of Panama for its
capital.
We may be in error, and certainly we do
not profess that our researches have been
exhaustive, but the earliest use we have
found of the term the Spanish Main is in
"The Journal of Admiral James," lately
published by the Navy Records fcocietv
where, on November 12, 1779, the Admiral
notes that he "bore away for Truxsllo on
the Spanish Main," Truxillo being the
port of Honduras.â Macmillan's Magazine.

AND MORE BABIES
Great Exhibition of Infant
Native Sons and
Daughters.
FOND MOTHERS HAPPY
When Their Little Ones Were
Prize Winners for Weight
or Beauty.
THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS
WLo Were Duly Interested as the
Beribbcned Children Were Put
Up for Inspection.
The management of the Home Products
Exhibition at the Mechanics' Pavilion ar
ranged that Admission day should go
down to history as "Babies' day." The
news went forth and thousands of mothers
f:ocked to the Pavilion. Hundreds came
with babies which might be prize
winners. Others brought babies who were
merely spectators. When the baby show
got fairly started it had the right-of-way,
and kept in the middle of the road all the
afternoon amid sunshine and squalls.
Sir George Bromley, who is a knight
and a great grandfather, was one of the
judges. Ernest O:to, S. H. Tacey and F.
Formfials acted as Mr. Bromley's asso
ciates, assisted by about all the clerical
force connected with the institute and ex
posftion. There wouid have been other
judges, but they failed to materialize
when the critical time arrived. Ed Green
way openly declined an appointment as
judge; James Phelan voiced the rank
heresy tnat "One baby is just like an
other." Judge Coffey declined on account
of 'multifarious duties"; Judge Campbell
simply ran away to Stockton.
The vista opening up before the com
peting babies was dazzling. The winners
wouid triumph before a crowd which
packed the galleries and the aisles, and
wno seemed to be all eyes. In addition to
thus being distinguished and admired
above ail other babies in sight, there were
prizes to be won, ranging from a pair of
oaby's lace pins to * silver cup, and from
a pap bowl and clay model bust to a silver
cup. The clay model bust waÂ« offered to
perpetuate the robust perfection of the
heaviest girl baby not over one year old.
The heaviest baby boy of the same tender
ace had prepared for his reward for be
coming fat a silver rattle with bells.
First all the babies who wanted to com
pete for prizes for weight in the various
classes engaged tne undivided attention
of all the judges and all their assistants,
and so four sets of scales were kept in
motion, while babies "tipped the Deam."
Not a few slept all through the weighing.
A few wanted to pull down the weisht on
the beam. Others simply kicked and
cried for all that they were worth. The
>r mind of man was manifested by
act that it took three judges, two
and one weigher-in-chief to weigh
in one baby, and then the weight was
afterward challenged in two or three in
stances. The judges persevered to the
end, and when they had recorded a lot of
facts about over 200 candidates for records
the weighing was over and the beauty
show of tne babies was begun.
The exposition band had only just
finished a performance of the overture to
"Semiramide" when tne musicians had
to come down from their elevated posi
tion in favor of the babie3, who, with
their fond mothers and the judges, occu
pied the band platform nearly all the aft
ernoon. There were four beauty prizes) â
two for the coys and two for the girls.
The babies were distinguished as to sex
by ribbons, the girls having pink ribbons
on the left shoulder and the boys having
-.boon on the right shoulder, it was
] lanned to have the girls and boys brought
up separately, but this could not always
be carried out, for no less than four pairs
of twins found tbeir way to the platform
a-.d helped to add to the statistical value
â -' the show.
The baby girls not over one year old had
the first trial, and this developed the plan
o: the judges. The parents with babes in
arm* sat by the score around the outer
edee of the platform. The judges locked
them all over and then prepared half a
dozen oÂ»" more tickets bearing numbers
and placed these in a silk hat. Then an
in/ant was coaxed to pu'l oat the tickets
and the- hr&t one to be selected drew tne
first prize ana the second selection enti
tled to the second prize, and so on. When
one class was judged the stage was wanted
by another. Tne stage was filled and
cleared four times of fat babies, lean
babies, bald-headed babies, blue-eyed,
hazel-eyed or black-eyed babies; babies
with curls and babies witnout, and in fact
abjut all sorts and conditions of Caucas
ian babies eligible to compete. Every
class came up quietiy. Every class went
off with the great majority of its members
cryiag.
The~judges said that they did not make
the banies cry. When the cause was inves
tigated it was discovered that Henry Root,
a bachelor, was handing them all down,
and they may have discovered his inex
perience. The prize winners were as fol
lows:

When the prizes were awarded the ex
hibitors were not all suited, especially
concerning the decisions in regard to
beauty, but the judges departed serene
and unruffled.
EVENING OF PLEASURE.
Special Musical Programme of Ital
ian Airs Has Been Prepared,
for This Evening.
The Native Sons and Daughters, that is
those who did not attend the celebration
at Stockton, were right royally entertained
at the Mechanics' exposition last night.
The exercises were in charge of Directors
Doolan and Cole and Secretary Cummings,
all Native Sons.
The Knickerbocker quartet, composed
of Metsrs. Lawrence. Elliott, Crane and
Larsen, rendered a song written by Leila
France, entitled "49. : ' in exquisite style.
Secretary Cummicgs followed in a brief
address, during which he said that while
nearly all the Native Sons were at Stock
ton, the Mechanics' Institute, which was
founded by Pioneers, should take some
recognition of the day.
He then introduced Merton C. Alien,
who delivered an eloquent address, during
which he took occasion to refer to the
overcrowded Condition of the higher pur
suits in life, particularly in the legal aud
medical fraternity. He said the greatest
present need of California was more pro
ducers.
Miss Deborah Hollingsworth of Oakland
then read an original prize poem, entitled
"Admission Da"y in California." The
poem is a eem in its way.
To-night will be Italian night. In the

Colonel Shafter, formerly a resident of
Angel Island, removed from there yester
day, his household furniture and other
goods and chattels being transported on
the Government steamer General McDow
ell and landed at Fort Mason.
This new move has no particular signifi
cance excepting that it is the carrying out
of orders issued a couple of months ago
by the War Department. It is understood
that the purpose of the orders is to con
centrate artillery regiments on the sea
coasts. To do this all the detached bat
teries of the regiment, scattered in outly
ing stations, are ordered into headquarters,
where General Graham *iil havethem im

Tlie infantry companies must take the
place of all the artillery troops in all the

Ii is the intention of the War Depart

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1896.
WHO FORGED A
JUSTICE'S NAME?
A Bold Swindler Issues a
Writ From Groezin
ger's Court
EVERY NAME A FORGERY
It Purports to Bs a Writ of
Possession for a House on
Natoma Street.
JAMES CRAVEH'S PREDICAMENT
Being Plaintiff in the Case He Is
Cited to Appear for Contempt
of Court.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger will
have one of the most important cases
before him on Monday that has ever come
to light in the courts of San Francisco, for
it involves nothing less than the charge
that some person or persons have been
forging the names of the Justice and his
cierKs to writs of possession and other
such documents, thereby trying to coerce
people into the payment of debts by
frightening them into the belief that they
were being ordered to act by the courts.
The case at Dai is a citation against one
James Craven of 55 Natoma street, for
contempt of court, in being party to the
perpetration of. frauds and forgeries pur
porting to emanate as genuine documents
from the hand of the Justice.
Attorney H. C. Grant appeared before
Justice Groezinger on Tuesday and de
manded to know whether a writ of posses
sion lor the premises at 55 Natoma street,
occupied by Mrs. Annie Growney. had
been issued. A careful search of the
records showed that no sneb writ bad ever
been issued. The attorney then said: 'I
bold in my hand a writ purporting to be
'No. 17,634, docket 61, page 69L' That
writ was presented to Mrs. Growney by
Craven, who asked her to vacate the
premises at once. The name of Frank
Williams appeari as clerk, per William
Johnson, deputy, and the name of Peter
Dougherty is signed as attorney for the
plaintiff."
On an inspection of the document and
the records of the court showins that the
paper had never been issued out of the
court the Justice at once became very in
dignant and issued a citation returnable
at 10 o'clock on Monday morning order
ing Craven to appear and show cause why
be should not be punished for contempt of
court.
"This is a case in which an example will
be made of the guilty party," he sa:d,
"and if It is proven that this man fixed up
this paper and attempted to frighten this
woman with it he will be punished to the
full extent of the law. No worse offense
against the dienity of a court could be
committed, and such practices must be
brought to a sudden termination by
drastic measures."
The full penalty for contempt is $100
fine or fifty days' imprisonment.
It was learned at 55 Natoraa street, in
the absence of James Craven, that he is
not the real party in interest in the suit,
and that whatever he did was in the inter
est of the landlady of the roomine-house,
Mrs. Reagan. She denies that anybody
in the house was party to any forgery.
HE WON ON McKINLEY.
A Prize-Fight That Decided the
Issue of the Present
Campaign.
Four Hard Rounds That Ended in
Favor of the Gold Standard
and Elliott.
At an early hour yesterday morning two
young men, John Elliott and James
Maguire, with their attendants and
friends, met in a house which has been
unoccupied for several months and is
situated near Ninth and Townsend streets.
The principals had a matter of im
portance to settle, and they decided to
determine the question of "to bÂ« or not to
be," with the naked fists. There were not
, more than a dozen spectators present, but
those who witnessed the mill went away
satisfied that they had enjoyed first-class
sport.
A woman, strange to say, did not figure
in this case. The trouble originated in a
wager on the election of McKinley and
Bryan.
filliott and Maguire could not agree on
! the question of free silver and they decid
ed to settle the dispute with their fists.
Elliott, who was a strong supporter of
McKinley, signed an agreement that if
Maguire should defeat him he (Elliott)
| would vote the Democratic ticket.
j Maguire. who was a stanch Democrat.
i signed an agreement that he would cast
[ his vote in favor of McKinley if Eiliott
proved to be the better man in a square
{ standup fight.
The men met according to appointment
â  and the contest waa carried off without
I interruption. Four punishing rounds
I were foueht and Elliott won when victory
i was in the reach of Maguire.
The first round was all in favor of Elliott,
who had his opponent on queer street
when time was called. Maguire rapidly
recovered his senses during the minute
| that was allowed for "refreshments," and
when time was calied for the second round
Elliott rushed at his quarry with the in
tention of doing his man up in quick or
der. Maguire duckea a wicked swing at
his face, and as Eiiiott came at nsra again
he was caught on tne point of the chin
with a powerful right-hand swing, which
%ent him sprawling on the rough floor.
The attendants who were looking after
i the fighter's interests became excited, and

a free fieht looked decidedly promising at
one time while Elliott was slumbering.
The McKinley man recovered, however,
at the call of time and staggered up to bis
opponent, Maguire. who missed an excel
lent opportunity by the exercise of very
bad judgment of winning the fight there
and then. His blows were fearfully wild
and useless, and in the interim Elliott re
covered his equilibrium and fought his
antagonist off until the end of the round.
No righting of any consequence resulted
in the third round, but the fourth round
was a hurricane.
Jast as soon as the fighters met their
fists new around like windmill fans. It
was a question as to who would first land
a knoctcout blow.
Elliott got home the first good smash on
Maguire'i left eye, which brought tae re
ceiver to his knees. It was purely a
chance blow, however, but it got there
]uÂ»t the same, and Maguire saw many
stars. Maguire was game, however, and
came to the scratch when the seventh
second was called. Â£lliott again jumped
at his game and struck wild, and in the
rally Maguire floored Eiliott by a left
swing on tne chin. Elliott Hopped aeainst
the side of the house, and while in a dazed
condition Maguire smashed at him with
ail his might, but instead of landing on
Elliott's face he struck the side of the
building and injured his right fist.
Elliott recovered eventually, and as
Maguire was settling himself for a knock
out blow, Elliott swung his right, hoping
that it would land somewhere. The blow
caught Maguire on the jugular, and the
man who must vote for McKinley went
down and remained on the floor until
counted out.
A BURGLER FIRED AT.
Trail of Blood Showed That the
Shots Had Taken Ef
fect.
Unsuccessful Attempt to Enter the
Residence of George McCraith,
Church Street.
A burglar who attempted to enter the
residence of George McCraith, 311 Church
street, Tuesday nieht, met with an ex
ceedingly warm reception.
McCraith had retired to bed about 11
o'clock after seeing that all the doors and
windows were properly eecured. The
building is a three-story one and McCraith
lives on the second flat. At the rear
there are steps that lead to the two upper
flats and at the top of each flight there is
â¢ porcb.
McCraith had not fallen asleep when
his sense of hearing wa3 sharpened by a
noise at one of the rear windows, as if
some person was trying to unfasten the
catch with a knife or other instrument.
He listened intently thinkine that proba
bly he had been mistaken, but the noise
was continued, and bearing in mind the
burglaries that had been committed re
cently, he decided to investigate.
He quietly got out of bed. pulled on his
socks, trousers and coat and grabbing his
revolver stoic softly to the rear door. He !
listened for an instant and was satisfied a j
man was on the porch endeavoring to
force open the window.
In a moment be had unlocked the door I
and thrown it wide open. A man was
standing at the window facing the porch,
and promptly rushed for the steps. As
he disappeared down the steps McGraith
: fired at his retreating figure and kept on |
| firing as long as the burglar was in sight, j
| He emptied his revolver and returning to
the house procured a light. He made an
j examination of tne sieps and saw a trail ;
| of blood all the way down and along the j
; yard to the gate where the burglar had
, made his exit, showing conclusively that
i one or more of his shots had taken effect.
McCraith waited for half an hour or so
: in the hope that the shots would have at
tracted the policeman on the beat, but as
â  no officer made his appearance he went
back to bis bed.
Yesterday morning he reported the at
tempted burglary to the police, and an ex
; amination of the yard and steps by an
| officer who was detailed to investigate
proved that he was not romancing.
Every effort is being made by the police
' to find the burglar and it is expected that
I he will soon be found, as the fact that he
was wounded is sure to leak out.
Mr. McCraith is with Thomas Mc-
Craith & Co., searchers of records, McAl
lister street, and feels incensed that hi 3
shots were not heard by some policeman,
as in that event the burglar might easily
have been caught.
HIT WITH AN OAB.
Gustavo Law Arrested for Assault to
Murder.
Phillip Meehan, a sailor, went to the
wharf at Fourth and Kentucky streets
yesterday afternoon. He was under the !
influence of liquor and in a quarrelsome
mood. He asked Gustave Law, a boatman
for George Lee, who owns the boathouse, j
where be could rind Lee. The answer did 'â 
not please Meehan, and from words they
started in to fight, Meehan being the
aggressor. Law seized an ax, but dropped j
it and grabbed & piece of an oar and struck !
Meehan over the head with it. knocking j
him down. They again clinched, and i
EndraNorris, a sailor, separated them. '
Law retreated to the boatbouse and |
Meehan followed him. Law seized a re-. j
volver and threatened to shoot Meehan if !
he entered, and luckily fur Meehan, just
at that time he fell from loss of Dlood. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and ;
had a wound in his scalp attended to.
Law was arrested by Policeman O'Con
nor and charged at the City Prison with
assault to murder.
Careful scientific observation shows that
the average speed of the transmission of
an earthquake shock is 16,000 feet per

were entered during the entire exercises.
A novelty in modern scientific research
is the means by which the wind may be
measured by the sound. The whistling of
the wind as it crosses a wire varies with
the velocity, and this can be computed
from the pitcn of the note observed in
case of a given diameter of wire and for a
given air temperature.

ATE CANDY JUST
BEFORE HER DEATH
She Jumps Into the Bay
From Powell-Street
Wharf.
RESCUED BY BOATMEN.
Taken to the Hospital and Ate
Chocolate Creams on the
Way.
DID SHE DIE FEOM POISON?
She Said Her Name Was Harmona
Wells, but Refused to Give Any
Further Information.
A young woman who said her name was
Harmona Wells died at the Receiving
Hospital about 10 o'clock yesterday morn-
Harmona Wells, or Lillie McGrath*
ing, and the cause of her death is shrouded
in mystery.
Shortly before 7 o'clock yesterday morn
ing she walked along near the Powell
street wharf and delioerately jumped into
the ba3 T . Boatmen Nesbitt and Hennessy
saw her and they quickly rescued her
before she reached deep water. The
water is not deep where she jumped in
and she had only succeeded in submerg
ing herself to the waist when dragged out.
The boatmen noticed that she was froth
ing at the mouth. They questioned her
as to her reasons for trying to drown her
self, but she positively refused to give
them any explanation.
The patrol wagon wa9 summoned from
the California-street station and Police-
man Grunwold accompanied it. When it
reached the wharf the young woman was
pacing back and forth apparently in good
health. Beiore the wajon arrived she had
protested against being taken to the
Receiving Hospital, but when the vehicle
arrived she lapsed into silence and quietly
took her seat.
On the way to the hospital she took I
from her pocket a bag of chocolate creams !
and ate a number of them. Whether they
were poisoned or whether she took some
po ison Defore jumping into the bay is so
far a mystery.
An autopsy held by Dr. Barrett last
evening disclo-ed the fact, that death re
sulted from asphyxiation. The stomach
and lungs were badiy congested and the
heart diseased to such an extent as to
probably cause death umler intense cx
ci tement. The stomach, which contained
a lot o: fluid, was sent to a chemist for
analysis. Until this is done the poison
theory will remain unsettled.
At the Receiving Hospital the young
woman said ncr name was Harmona
WelJs. She said she had little cause to
wish to live. Life was a burden to her,
but she would not say why. rier parents,
she said, lived up north, but where she
declined to say.
It was suspected that she had swallowed
some drug, probably strychnine, and she
was treated accordingly. She seemed all
right till about 10 o'clock, when she was
seized with violent pains and died in a
few minutes.
Efforts were made at the last moment to
secure iacts concerning her home and
friends, but she would not converse on the
subject, promising to tell every thinir when,
she got well again. Then she lapsed into
unconsciousness and died in a few min
utes.
In her pocket was found a piece of paper
with the name "John Lincoln" scribbled 1
upon' it. Her clothing was again carefully j
searched at the Morgue, but the only arti
cle found was the half of a blotter, on
which appeared the words, "By cash $200,
Grace M. E."
She was about 26 years of age, fair com
plexion, medium height and sparely built.
She wore a black sateen skirt, light-green ;
ca'ico waist and white straw bat with high
crown.
About 10:40 o'clock last evening a woman
givine ncr name as Maud Edwards and
place of residence ay room 5, 222}^ Fourth
street, called at the Morgue and positively
identified the remains as that of woman
named Liliie McGrath, who had lived on
Point Lobos avenue, between Twentv
third and Twenty-fourth avenues.
She said lhe dead woman had been a
waitress lately, and could assign no cause
for her suicide except despondency.
Shortly after, a man named Frank
Brown, who has been a private night

Morgue and said that the night previously
he bad seen the woman in the Cascade
saloon, corner of Kearny and Commercial
streets. *
He further staled that he had heard her
make the remark that she used to work in
the Thalia Theater.
So positive was Brown that he went over
to the Cascade and brought one of the
waitresses over to identify the remains.
The waitress, however, was in doubt as to
whether the dead woman was the one
Brown saw in the saloon.
SIREN SONGS FOR GOPHERS.
How Florida Land Turtles Art Lured
Out of Their Holes.
W. fl. Gilbert, locksmith, astronomer,
fisherman, scientist, hunter and capital
ist, is a great fancier of gopher meat, and
has thought ol many ways of catching the
game.
Some time ago he learned that there was
a family living in the northwestern part
of the county which boasted of young men
who could "sing" gophers out of their
holes. He traveled many miles to ascer
tain if the report was really true.
The young men were reluctant at first to
give an exhibition that might reveal their
secret, but Mr. Gilbert had a number of
pursuasives along, and finally they con
sented.
The young men equipped themselves
with a gunnysack and a pointed stick
about five feet long. A half-mile from the
house, in the wire-grass of the rolling
pine land, they found the hole of a
gopher. They covered the entrance of his
tunnel with a sack and planted the stick
over the tunnel. Then all of the men lay
down about twenty feet away, and one of
them sang.
In a half hour the sack was seen to
move slightly, whereupon one of the
young men jumped up quickly and ran to
the stick, which he pressed deep into the
ground, cutting off the gopher's retreat.
The other reached his hand into the hole
and brought out a big gopher, which waÃ
made into a delicious stew for their din
ner. Mr. Gilbert, discoursing on the in
cident, says:
'â¢I have since learned that the Mexicans,
wno are very fond of gophers, pursue this
method, except that they do not sing. The
singing is entirely superfluous. Curiosity
is what kills the "gopher, as it haÃ killed
the historic cat. The animal evidently is
curious to learn what it is that has dark
ened the threshold of his abode, and
comes forth to see. The stick does the
rest. 1 have tried the same plan myself,
and very successfully.' 7 â Florida Times-

An A 1 h1) ima Decision.
An Alabama Register in Chancery tnkes
first rank as a lover of abstract justice.
Recently, in stating an account as master,
when the evidence showed that a large
quantity of corn bargained to plaintiff had
been lost by the defendant's agent, whose
duty it was to deliver it to plaintiff, the
Register announced his decision as fol
lows: "While, perhaps, the law and the
evidence are on the side of the plaintiff, I
think it would be unjust that the de
fendant should lose all tuis corn. I there
fore charge the plaintiff with the corn."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1896.
A Parisian Thief's Gallantry.
A pretty young American lady was
robbed in a most impudent manner while
shopping yesterday afternoon in one of
the largest shops in Paris. Her purchases
terminated she was astonished to find that
the purse which she carried attached to a
chatelaine, together with a number of
gold trinkets, had disappeared. The
purse contained about 500 francs and
a ticket for her boxes, which were
deposited at the railway station. Then
she remembered that a well-dressed, gen
tlemanly looking man had followed her
about the shop, and just as she reached
the pay desk had pushed aeainst her. She
immediately informed the police of what
had occurred, and then went to the rail
way station to look after her boxes,
but found that they had already
been withdrawn by the "gentleman.''
She returned to her hotel in de
spair, for her boxes contained all her
jewelry and a considerable quantity of
other valuables. At 7 o'clock in the even
ing a commissionaire arrived at the hotel
with the boxes. Their entire contents
had bee-i abstracted, but in one of them a
note had been placed to the following
effect: â¢ "My dear Missâ Permit a very sin
cere admirer of your charming person to
give you a little bit of advice: Beware of
over-gallant gentlemen and young gentle
men who follow ladies about."âWest
minster Gazette.
The cultivation of mushrooms is really
a matter of "ancient history" in France.
The people are so fond of them, they are
so nutritious, and their raising is so profit
able, that very few Frenchmen are so poor
that they cannot have their beloved veg
etable.
COMMERCIAL RECORD.
PAOiriC COAST BONDS.
The water bonds of Sulsun have been printed
in this City, and Mayor Long has been in San
Francisco consulting with parties concerning the
sale of the same. The Suisun Republican says
chat Mr. Long's visit to the City was a satisfactory
one and it is probable that the bonds will be sold
in time to complete the work before the rainy sea
son is fairly begun.
Salt has been begun against Professor T. 8. C
Lowe and hia wife, W. H. Holmes, the Los An
geles Safe Deposit and Trust Company and the
Mount Lowe Hotel Company, a corporation, trus
tees, to foreclose a mortgage on the property of
Professor Lowe and his wife. The Indebtedness
arose upon a promissory note for $30,000, and thb
security la the improved real estae and the
Operu-hoiise building at Pasadena owned by Pro
fessor Lowe. The complainant asks for the ap
pointment of a receiver. The sum demanded is
$.->O,OOO, with accrued interest on the note and at
torney's fee and cost.
Since the Mrs: day of last January, building per
mits representing expenditures aggregating (426,
-675 have been granted by the Board of Public
Works of the city of San Diego.
The election In the Kureka (Calaveras County)
School District, to determine concerning the issue
of bonds amounting to $400 in denominations of
960 each, bearing interest at the rate of 8 uer cent
per annum, will be held on the 28th inst.
Bonds numbered 9, 10, 11. 13, 13. 14. 15 and 16
of .Mario County, known as the refunding bonds,
tnird series, with all interest accrued thereon, will
be paid by the Treasurer of Marin County. Thomas
J. Fallon, upon presentation, on or before Septem
ber 12, at which date interest on the bonds will
cease.
City Auditor Gambell of Portland has succeeded
in Belling $35,000 of the Improvement bonds of
Portland to W. J Cruthers, a bond- buyer, woo bid
par and accrued interest. The Portland Oregonian
thinks that considering the state of the market lor
securities, this may be thought to be a favorab.e
sale for the class of bonds in question. Auditor
Gambell thinks that there is no reason why city
warrants are not now as good an investment as at
any previous time this year. The amount of out
standing warrants against the city of Portland Is
$81,000, as against something over $160,000 on
January 1.
Ti.e City Council of Tacoma passed a funding
bond ordinance to retire outstanding warrants, the
vote being 11 to 6, and it was agreed to mace the
rate of interest 5 percent, instead of 6 percent as
originally proposed. Mayor Fawcett vetoed the
funding plan and in an attempt to pass the ordi
nance over the .â - ayor's veto the Council failed by
a vote of 9 to 6.
The Rlalto Irrigation District has elected W. A.
Norton president and J. K. Mack secretary. The
directors hold their omc-e another year, having
been elected for two years.
A ranch of seven acres at Klmhurst, Alameda
County, has been sold to San Francisco parlies for
$6000, according to the Sau Laaudro Reporter.

NEW YORK, N. V. t Sept. 9.â Stocks opened
active and buoyant. Commission firms reported
an increase In business and London houses exe
cuted buying orders In the Internationally listed
issues. The favorable report of the St. Paul for
the fiscal year and he action of the Manhattan di
rectors on the dividend continued to exert a favor
able Influence on speculation, and the sentiment
was decidedly bullish. A drive was made against
the shorts -In Manhattan, Tobacco, Sugar and
Chicago Gas, and an advance of Â»4@28/ 8 per cent
resulted. The declaration of the usual dividends
by the Western Union and sugar companies and
increased disposition on the part of bankers to dis
count commercial paper and a reduction In the
posted rates of sterling exchange of % to Â«4 82%
and $4 84^i stimulated the upward movement.
The sharp advance induced realizations' on a
moderately heavy scale, and the room â  traders,
who have been talking reaction for some days,
put out small lines of shorts In the k angers and
Industrials. This selling brought about a decline
of Â»4@3 per cent, the latter in Chicago Gas.

CHICAGO, lil. Sept. 9.â After several in
effectual straggles to break away from the figures
established at the close yesterday, wheat : this
morning became quiet and set. led Into a rut. The
bulls made capital out of frost predictions from the
Northwest, and succeeded in - advancing prices a
few fractions, but the limited export clearances,
121,268 bushel*, altered the feeling and caused re
cessions. Liverpool opening. cabl s were steady,
closing ones were yÂ«d lower. Receipts at Chicago
were 414 cars, and 90,150 bushels were taken
from store. Bradstreets reported an increase In
the world's stocks of 3,392,000 bushels, and the
crowd sold rather freely on. the fisures, only to
Una a paucity of offerings when endeavoring to
cover later, tbe market becoming s roni; and ad
vicclmt quite a little. Closing Paris and Berlin
cables were higher and Antwerp 11 n. hanged. De
cember wheat opened from s{J@s7%c, advanced
to &B%c, closing at 58*/2 - %c higher than yister
day K.ttunated receipts for to-morrow 200 cars.
CORNâ Tbe business situation In corn was
stagnant, and prices, in lieu of direct information
or influence, were dependent upon the action of
wheat lor inspiration. Receipts were 898 cars and
497,414 bushels were withdrawn from store.
Liverpool cables were , quiet and unchanged.
Bradstreets reported a decrease In stocks 0f'693,
-000 bushels- Export clearances amounted to
264,448 bushels. May corn opened at aH7'Â»c,
sold between 23% and-j!4c, closing at 23% c. un
changed from yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow 6>o cars.
OaTS â I he dullness of wheat and corn was re
produced in oats, with - prices moving slowly ana
within a narrow range. The sentiment was firm,
however, crop news being generally encouraging
to ho. dors. Receipts were 665 cars, and 66,211
bushels were withdrawn from store. Brad streets
reported an increase In stocks if 674.000 bushels.
)â¢ xports were insignificant. May closed at Vi@
3' 8 c higher than yesterday. Estimated receip.s
for to-morrow 216 cars.
FLAXâ Steady. Cash. 68%@640; September,

PRuV lalON Sâ Trade in provisions was so quiet
that prices were inert during the most of the
session. Opening advances, due to a steady hog
market, were sustained later, without any â  par
ticular effort in thai direction. The subsequent
strengthening of wheat prices exercised a good
effect on provisions. January pork closed 12% c

PROOF AGAINST
NITRO-GLYCERINE
Captain McLean of Pinole
Has Lived Through
All Explosions.
i
WRECK ABOUT REBUILT. { :
Men Can Always Be Found Who
Seem Anxious to Live on
the Verge of Danger.
EXPLOSIONS TEACH NOTHING.
No One Who Could Tell Anything Re
garding the Cause Ever Escapes
With Lite.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
808 Broadway, Sept. 9. )
Although a holiday, work was not
dropped at the powder works at Pinole i
yesterday. Old John McLean, who went '
JOHN McLEAN, Foreman of the Pinole Powder Works, Who Has
Come Out of Every Explosion Unharmed.
to work for the company in the early
seventies, when the works were located on
the Almshouse Tract in San Francisco,
was busy as usual directing the renovating
of the wreck of last week.
Captain McLean is a fixture of the pow
der works. He is one of the few fixtures,
as nearly every portion of the works and
many of the employes during the past
twenty-five years have fallen victims to
the many explosions.
"We'll soon be at work again," said
Captain McLean, who derives his title
from his connection many years ago with
the old Liberty Hose Company of the
early San Francisco Fire Department.
"A wreck from an explosion is one of the
easiest to fix up. There is no use trying
to put the pieces togetber. You know
that everything is totally ruined and that
you may as well start at once to rebuild
the houses.
"Dangerous? Life in a powder-mill?
It isn't and it is. So far as the real cause
of the accident is concerned we haven't
made much progress. You see the people
who could tell us all about it are not
around after tne explosion. No, that is a
mistake; but they are net in a condition
to tell us how it happened. Once forty
one men went up with the mixing-house,
and that is the general way of all ex
plosions. W T hen she up she goes and
those that don't go with her are left
guessing.
"Anything very peculiar about the last
flasn? There are peculiar things about
all explosions. You can't account tor
them any more than you can account for
the explosion itself. Sometimes the stuff
seems to po up, sometimes down and
sometimes sideways. Last year it went
down and made a hole in the ground bi--Â»
as a hill. This year it went up. Next
timeâ l won't guess what it may do.
"Plenty of Chinamen? Swarms. "We
can always get all the help we need.
Never was an explosion that we conld not
till the places of the lost next morning.
Don't you know there are a certain num
ber of men in all communities that like to
play with fire."
In a few days' time the mixine-house
and the nitre-house and the acid-house
will be filled with busy workmen, the eu
calyptus trees will burst out with new
leaf, the acres of burned grass will turn
green and the beautiful hillside will be in
readiness to be the scene of another
tragedy. _______ __^____
"PRAY, BUT DON'T WORK"
Chief of Police Lloyd Fires a
Bombshell at the City
C. E Union.
A Letter That Wili Doubtless Provoke
a Warm Discussion at the
Nxt Meeting.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call )
908 Broadway, Sept. 9. j
Chief of Police Lloyd has stirred up the
cily Christian Endeavor Union as it was
never agitated since its former preeident,
E. A. Sherman Jr., passed resolutions
censuring Mr. Lloyd's predecessor, Louis
Schaffer.
Chief Lloyd says that the Endeavorers
pray and sing too much and work too lit
ile along practical lines. After referring
Â»o the enormous strength of the Christian
Endeavor body, as evidenced by the 32,000
delegates at the Washington convention, j
he asks, "What is this magnificent or- ;
ganization doing along the practical lines
ofjevery-day Christianity 7 ; '
The next portion of his communication
compares the Christian Endeavor Union
to the army of General G. B. McClellan.
Chief Lloyd says it is beautifully organ
ized and consists of ideal soldiers, but that
they are not doing any active fighting.
Then the Chief proceeds to business and
says: "It comes to me that ideas .and
suggestions may be well Jreceived by the
Christian Endeavor Union from those
who would like to know What is the
good we may be doinj;?" He continues:
In my official capacity "I have often been
greatly exercised in behalf of the numerous
little children who are so often thrown within
the walls of the City Prison, where they can
receive but scant comfort, no provision being
made to care for them, and who when they
escape from tne prison walls find little incen
tive tor future striving or right living. There
are little waifs, often without a lather or
mother, and just as often with home sur
roundings of such a character that even the
streets ami prison walls would be purer and
better.
"What can be done to reclaim them as good
citizens and thus benefit humanity?" is a
question that should De answered, and one
that I believe it Is the province of your union
to solve. In 99 cases out of every one hundred
these unfortunate little waifs, if given proper
care and attention, might be reclaimed to use
ful man or woman hood, and many a boy and
girl would, from the proud pedestal of good
and virtuous citizenship, bless the hands that
assisted to raise them from their lower level.
and pure homes and faithful parents would
lessen crime ana make virtue more abundant,
while the penitentiaries and houses of shame
would be robbed of many an inmate.
Let me call your attention to the work that
is being done by the Salvation Army. Here
from the City Hall we have ample opportunity
to witness their operations day by day. These
earnest workers, oblivious to the scon's and
jeers that greet them upon every side, keep
steadily at work uplifting and comforting hu
manity. They do not wait lor them to come,
but they go out into the slums and byways and
search for the wanderers and the poor and un
fortunate. Not only do they minister to their
spiritual well being, but they likewise take
care of the physical manâ feed the hungry,
comfort the sorrowing and clothe the naked â
and many a man has been brought to think of
a better life and future existence after being
fed and clothed.
This brings me ta"k to the magnifi- i
cent organization of the Christian En- !
deavor Union. I believe that there is ;
too much of singing and praying, and j
not enough of the practical Christianity dis
played by Jesus, who -went about healing the j
sick, raising the dead, comforting the sorrow- i
ing and feeding the hungry.
I do not wish to appear in the role of a critic, !
but rather as a friend to offer suggestions j
which may be oi value. Therefore I would ask, i
aside from our routine w.;rk, what practical |
efforts are we making along the lines for which
we are organized? And what are we adding ;
to the efforts for humanity? How often have !
we bent our united efforts to comfort, feed !
clothe and care for the homeless and the or
phan?
Xow I come back to the little waifs who are
so often thrown upon tne cold charity of the
City Prison. What might not this orpaniza
tion of 3000 members in Oak. and be abk: to
accomplish for these little ones? With a
small outlay of even 10 cents a month we
could raise a fund of $300, and with this
thirty or forty little children could re well
cared for, and with so little effort on our part
would be the means of saving hundreds of
good citizens and finally as earnest workers on
the same line. My young friends, the world
needs more practical,healthful,every-dayCnris
tiflnity in this age ttian ii does ot hymns and
fervent prayers, although it need not dispense
with this feature, either.
I offer these suggestions to you to give you a
subject for discussion and thought and effort
along a line that I do not think has yet been
thoroughly exhausted, believing that this or
ganization can accomplish wonderful results,
and results of which every true citizen will
feel proud, if said organization only de
termines to do so. Charles E. Lloyd,
Chiet of Police.
The communication is addressed to the
'Officers and Executive Committee of the
Christian Endeavor Union of Oakland."
It will be. read at the neit meeting of the
City Union, in about two weeks, and will
certainly provoke an animated discussion.

TEN DELEGATES PRESENT.
Monopolies Would Disappear if the
Money Spent in Drink Were
Put in Legitimate Trade.
Oakland Office Sak Fbasctbco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 9. )
Ten people were present in Hamilton
Hall to-day when Joseph Humphrey called
the Prohibition County Convention to
order. They were: O. G. May, E. C.
Arnold, S. P. Meads, Rev. Mr.Hoyt, Joseph
Humphrey, Dr. P. J. McCarger, F. E.
Coulter, Miss A. B. Tayriton, J. P. Hayes
and R. Wiand.
Dr. McCarger was elected temporary
president and J. H. Hayes secretary.
Chairman McCarger appointed the follow
ing committees:
Platformâ S. P. Meads, Miss Taynton
and E. C. Arnold.
Permanent Organization â O. G. May, R.
Wiand and Joseph Humphrey.
While the committee were preparing
their report some unique prohibition em
blems were passed around. One repre
sented a silver dollar. On one side was
printed: "Since the saloon receives 16 to
the farmer's and laborer's 1, or one-third
of all our business, ergo, vote the Pro
hibition ticket for prosperity. The dollar
will look after itself."
On the other side the following an
nouncement appeared: "A bushel of corn
makes four gallons of whisky, worth $16.
Government gets $4 80; railroads, $1; man
ufacturer, $3 50; saloon, $6; farmer, for
corn, 30c; laborer, for work, 40c: drinker
gets hell; Nation gets bard times."
Chairman S. P. Meads of the committee
on platform read the following:
We, the Prohibitionists of Aiameda County,
in convention assembled, hereby adopt the
following platform setting lorth our princi
ples:
Resolved, That we heartily indorse the plat
form of the National Prohibition party adopted
at PittsDurg, including the suffrage resolution.
Secondâ We regard all measures called re
strictive ones, such as "removing screens."
"closing entrances," "Sunday closing," "tJOO
foot remedies," etc., as utterly ineffectual In
meeting the organized National liquor power
in polities
Tnirdâ We believe that Christian voters
should not be religiously opposed to the saloon
and politically in iavor "of it.
Fourthâ We b-'lieve the license system Is "a
covenant with death and a league wit:, hell. 1 '
Governments have no right to barter away the
morals of the people for any money considera
tion.
Fifthâ We believe that the present money
stringency has been largely caused by the
gathering of silver from tne products of labor
by wealthy brewers and distillers and its ex
change into gold at the National treasury to
be shipped from our country.
Sixthâ We believe that labor cannot better
its condition by means either temperate or
violent as long as it must carry upon its bur
dened shouldera thousands of drunken work
men ready to sell their birthright for a mesa
of pottage. We also believe that the immigra
tion question would be positively and finally
settled by the adoption of National prohibi
tion. We believe that the question of monopo
lies would be settled for once aud all if the
money wasted by them upon drink should be

MrÂ». Palmer FireÂ« Three Shots at a
Marauder Who Broke the
Wludow.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 9.â Mrs. Palmer,
the ticket agent of the Southern Pacific
Company at the Oak-street station of the
Seventh-street local system, was startled
shortly after midnight by having the
ticket window broken in by a large stone
in the hands of a man. He never opened
his mouth, but she grabbed her revolver,
shoved it in his face and fired. The cap
failed to po, and the marauder dodeed
down and made off. She put her arm out
of the window and fired three shots at the
fleeing form, but failed to hit him. A
shrill call on the police whistle brought
Officer Clarke to the scene, but he faiied
to catch the man. The officers had been
changing at the hour at a point a dozen
blocks distant.
The officers have a good description of
the man, and will undoubtedly be able to
take him in. They do not believe it was
an attempt at robbery, but more to intimi
date Mrs. Palmer fora purpose best known

THEY DON'T WANT TENTS
Berkeley Collegians Object to
Having Recitations Held
Under Canvas.
Captain R. P. Thomas Celebrates Ad
mission Day in' Fitting Style at
His Mountain Home.
BERKELEY, Cal., Bept 9.â The report
in yesterday morning's Call of the inten
tion of the Board of Regents to furnish
tents in which to hold recitations because
of the overcrowded condition of the uni
versity buildings caused a ripple of com
motion among the students. But the
report to-day that the board had decided
positively to carry out the scheme caused
t.-e ripple to assume the proportions of a
tidal wave.
The students do not relish the idea even
to a small degree. They say that during
the winter season they will be placing
their liyes in jeopardy, as colds and sore
throats are almost certain to result from
the more or less violent exposure to which
they will be submitted if confined within
a thin shell of canvas.
Some of them absolutely declare that
they wili "cut" all recitations that are
held in tents during rainy weather, be
cause they would rather get "cinched out"

Captain Thomas Celebrates.
BERKELEY, Cal., fcept. 9.â Admission
day was celebrated very quietly by the
town people, but up on tne hill, three
quarters of a mile back of Berkeley, Cap
tain R. P. Thomas, the Soap King, kept
up a continuous bombardment from day
break to sunset with his two historic how
itzers, stationed at his celebrated "Fort
Thomas."
Down in the dense grove of eucalyptus
trees, planted by his own hand, a short
distance from the fort, the captain and his
i wife entertained between 300 and 400
! visitors from San Francisco, Oakland,
Aiameda and Berkeley, who had come to
show their love for the Golden West by
feasting together and listening to the
patriotic addresses.
A musical and literary programme was
: rendered, and addresses in keeping with
the occasion were delivered by Attorney
| George W. Haight, Charles Keller and
Rev. E. B. Payne. Tables were set under
the trees and in a huge tent, and refresh
ments were served by the ladies of the
i party.

INJURED BY THE X RAY.
Willie Leary, the Glass - Eater, Was
Serlou*ly Hurt by the Experi
ments.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 9.â Lying in a
local lodging-house, weak and pale and
almost broken in spirit, lies Willie Leary,
the young man glass-eater who startled
the visitors at the recent exposition by
eating glass tumblers and lamp chimneys,
and he is strong in the belief that all of
his troubles are due to efforts to view his
interior anatomy by means of the X ray.
After several experiments at glass-eat
ing, local physicians put him on a table
with the cathode ray apparatus strapped
to nis back. When the current was turned
on he received a severe shock and had his !
back burned badly. This has developed
into a ir.aiignant sore, which covers a
large portion of his back. His nerves
were so shattered that he cannot eat glass
until greatly improved.
"They tcld me they would not hurt
me,'' he said, "so I let them put on the
cathode ray. It knocked me down and
burned my back horribly. It has been I
over two weeks ago, but it burns awfully i
yet, aud I can't sieep at night. It caught j
me in the muscles, too, so that the doctors !
| say I will not be well for five or six years.
If that is so I will die, for I can't stand it.
"I have an engagement with the circus
in San Francisco now waiting for me, and \
I was to get $35 a week, but I am too sick,
so I can't go. They didn't treat me right,
those X-ray men, and now they have left
me all alone to suffer.
"I can't drink water like I used to, and
it make* a whole lot of difference, for I j
have to eat food now. I had some bread j
| yesterday, but it made me awful sick. !
â  No, I can't eat glass much now, either,
i because I am not able to drink enough
! water.
""You see, I always drink about a gallon
of water as soon as 1 get up, but now four
glasses are all I can get away with. I
never have stopped eating glass all my
life before and 1 never was sick until now.
| 1 am going to write to my father, who is
: In Randolph, Wis., and tell him that I am
â  bick and that they have made mo so. I
am sure he will come out here at once and
make it hot for these people."

Hard Customers.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 9.â The Mer
chants' Exchange has had under consider
ation for some time the question of how
it could collect bills from county and city
officials who try to live without paying
for their groceries and dry goods. It is
likely that they will try to have a bill
passed by the next Legislature whereby the
treasurer shall deposit the salaries oi offi
cials in a solvent bank to be drawn not
sooner than thirty days after deposited.
This would give merchants an opportunity
to attach salaries withont tyine up county
funds, to prevent which the present law
was framed.

HAMERTON GOT APPLAUSE
Seven Thousand Yelled Approval
as He Downed a Ter
rified Horse.
Exciting Scenes During the Free
Amateur Races at Ingelside
Yesterday.
Over 7000 persons were at the Insleside
racetrack yesterday as the invited guests
of the Golden Gate Park Driving Associa
tion, the occasion being the first tourna
ment neld by this recently organized club
of amateur horsemen, who like good driv
ing and want the public to take more in
terest in horses. The meet was an un
qualified success.
Following is the summary of events,
each owner driving his own horse.
First race, one mile, 2:35 classâ Dr. G. W.
Leek's Kate Ha- Ha won in two st raight beats
â2:37 and 2:33â with John T. Dare's Dare sec
ond, the prizes being a $25 harness and ass
hat. Dare's long horse was impeded by being i
hitched too close to an inappropriate sulky.
The. race was won only through superior driv- !
ing by Dr. Leek, who held his horse steadily, !
while the faster Dare was several times forced |
off his feet, particularly while coming down >
the stretch, but the finishes were close.
Second race, one mile dash. 3:15 class â L.
Richardson's Belie won in2:st% with H. G.
Stindt's Jim Budd second and Joseph Shanzer's j
Nettie Seal third, the prizes being $15 in value '
â one year's subcriptibn to The Call, and one j
set of shoes. The winner finished in a jog, \
the other horses being hopelessly behind after
breaking on the back stretch.
Third race, one mile dash, 4-minute class â !
T. T. Pottinger's Tony R won in 3:06, with M. ;
J. Lawlor's Black Jack second and William
Donald's Bonnie Lass third, the prizes being a ;
$15 bridle, a $5 whip and one set of shoes, i
The winner, who was an even favorite against i
the field, led from the start. I. W. Rider's j
Bruce broke on the first turn and ran all the |
backstretch, demoralizing Black Jack and j
Bonnie Lass and actually passing under the I
wire a length ahead of the legitimate winner, ;
only to be fine! $1 and disqualified Dy the ]
judges.'
Fourth race, half-mile, two out of three |
beats. 2:50 classâ John Mccarty's Lee Patchen ;
won by taking the first and third heats in i
1:26^ and 1:19. with Gus Bauer's Correct, j
winner of second heat in 1 :25! 3 , second, and
W. HlKginbottofu's Billy Button third; the j
prizes being a bay mare, two years' subscrip- |
tion to Breeder and Sportsman and 500 ;
pounds of grain. Lee Patchen had sold favor
ite. Ex-Assemblyman McCarthy, brother of
Dan of the high white hat, created- some dis
satisfaction, but after some parleying the j
judces permitted him to drive another heat, i
and he won it handily by thirty-live yards. â¢
Fifth race, three-eighths of a mile dash for '
truck horses weighing 1500 pounds or overâ j
J. C. Ohlandt's Natural Ice, the favorite, won
by 75 yards in 1:39, with Charles F.Newman's I
Moilie second and T. B. Broderick's great big,
lumbering, black nightmare, Dan, third, the :
prizes being one case of whisky and $10 in i
dentistry.
Sixth race, one-mile dash; 2:25' classâ Ed
Algeltinger's Our Joe won by 30 yards in i
2:3614, with Adam Baker's Mattie B second I
and Benjamin Levy's Mooger third, the prizes j
being a $25 lnprobe, tweive bales of straw ana ,
one silver caracase.
Seventh race, one mile, 2:30 class, If. A.
Reunion's Abbott won in two straight beats in '
2:34 and 2:36, with J. A. Sweeney's Wing !
Wing second and W. C. Hamerton's Fairmont i
Prince third, the prizes being a $15 whip and \
$10 in job printing.
Fairmont Prince was a 2 to 1 favorite
against the field, but while scoring for the first i
heat met with a sensational accident that '
wrecked the sulky and would have been very I
serious had it not been for the horsemanship '
and remarkable presence of mind of Mr. Ham- ;
erton, who dodged his falling horse as it reared |
and fell backward and quickly jumped over I
the prostrate body and held the animal's head j
down while assistance came. It all occurred ;
right in front of the judges' stand and the im
mense throng of spectators gave vent to their j
appreciation in a spontaneous burst of ap
plause. The fall doubtless shook the horse up '
considerably, as it showed poor form in the !
two heats.
Eighth race, one-mile dash, 3:30 class, A.
Schwartz's Kitty 8 won in 2:56, with G. T. j
Reynolds' Dandy second and F. W. Thomp
son's Miss Bishop third, the prizes being a $15
lap robe, ass whip and four bales of hay. T.
P. Minneb.au being left at the post suddenly
whipped up when the bunch had gone a
quarter, and to the great delight of the crowd
ran his mare the entire mile.
Ninth race, one-mile dash, three-minute '
class, J. W. McDonald's Anteo Conors won in '
2:59, with N. Johnson's Qneenie second and j
J. J. Smith's Stein-Echo third, the prizes being
$15 in value, a pair of scuff boots and one set
of shoes. â¢

OPENING OF A
NEW GOLF CLUB
The First Tournament Ever
Given in San Fran
cisco.
MANY VOTARIES ATTEND
The Fine New Grounds Are
Close to the Presidio
Reservation.
HANDICAP AND SWEEPSTAKES.
Winslow and McÃean the Winners,
Tournaments Will Now Be
Given Monthly.
The first golf tournament ever held in
this City took place yesterday under the
auspices of the San Francisco Golf Club,
at the club's new grounds, south of the
Presidio reservation.
Golf is an imported form of recreation,
wnich has hitherto had a very imperfect
trial in California. Hanford, Tulare
County, has a flourishing golf club and a
few years ago Burlingame possessed one,
but it perished for lack of interest.
It is believed tbat the grounds of the
San Francisco Golf Club, which were
opened for the tournament yesterday,
wili do much toward fostering interest in
the sport. Near the entrance to the
grounds on Central avenue stands a hand
some clubhouse, nearly completed, and
the links themselves, while not presenting
all the advantages of the native heath of
golf, offer a very good substitute for
Scotch golfing grounds.
The sagebrush does nearly as well as
gorse, and there are inequalities in the
ground which make up for the lack of
sand hills. The baked condition of the
vegetation is a drawbacs, but the autumn
rains will soon remedy that.
Tne whole distance round the nine holes
is 2141 yards, ana the tournament yester
day was twice round. From the tee to
the first hole is 183 yards, and the second
hole, which is called the telephone, is 235
yards farther.
The third hole is 192 yards, most of the
distance being up hill on ground exposed
to the winds. The fourth hole is 341 yards
farther on, and the fifth, the short, 171
yards; the sixth hole is 232 yards farther
on, and the seventh, the high, 200 yards.
To reach the eightn hole the players have
to go down hill in the face of the trade
winds, and a very rough bit of ground, 303
yards in length, lies between the eiehth
and the ninth holes.
The tournament consisted of a handicap
played in the morning which was only
open to club members, and a sweepstakes
in the afternoon which was open to ail
Comers. There were only a couple of en
tries from the outside, however. Opinion
seemed to be pretty evenly divided as to
whether ordinary street clothes should be
worn or the regulation golhng outfit.
Some of the players were resplendent in
all the glories of tartan stockings and cos
tumes of the most approved style.
The handican began at 10:30 and lasted
till 1. The following gentlemen played,
pitted against one another in singles:
B. L. Aobott Jr. and Charles Page, K. E.
Forman and J. E. Rawiins, Jo n Parrott
and John Lawson, C. R. Winslow and C.
F. Mullins, Robert Oxnard and P. G. Mc-
Bean. John Lawson was put down as a
scratch man. Some good playing was
shown, although the wind interfered with
what should have been some straight
driving.
The average of the scores was 51. C. R.
Winslow was the winner of the hanaicap.
A. number of visitors came to see the
sweepstakes in the afternoon. The piay
ers were the members who had taken part
in the handicap in the mornine. The
sweepstakes began at 2&nd lasted till 4:30,
McÃean being declared the winner.
It is the intention of the club to hold
tournaments every month during the dom
ing autumn, and it is believed that with a
little more practice a very creditable show
ing will be made.
The members of the club are:

THE ARCHBISHOP
ON CIVIL LIBERTY
Thousands Hear a Lecture
at Metropolitan Tem
ple.
CATHOLICSAND FREEDOM
The Young Men's Institute
Course Formally Inaugu
rated.
A LARGE AUDIENCE ASSEMBLES
Archbishop Riordan Tells the Story
of the Ages and Pleads tor
Liberty Now.
Metropolitan Temple was crowded last
night with a select audience that came to
hear Archbishop P. W. Riordan'a lecture
on "Individual and Political Liberty."
The American flag covered the pulpit dur
ing the lecture.
The stage was occupied by a number of
prominent members of the Young Men's
Institute and of the Catholic clergy, and
the lecture was preceded by an organ pre
lude.
The introductory speech was made by
Chairman Frank J. Kierce, who said : "It
is gratifying to see so large and intelligent
an audience on the occasion of the first
lecture of the Y. If. 1., the first of an in
structive series which we hope to present
every month."
The speaker said the members of the
Young Men's Institute were proud that
their organization, which began thirteen
years ago, has extended its membership
far beyond the Sierras. "The cardinal
principles of our order," he said, "are zeal
ousness for faith, for country and for the
welfare of our fellow-men. We are for
God and for country, and while we are
Catholics we do not ignore the benefits of
other orders. We last year did charity
work for men, women and children irre
spective of creed, and we are now engaged
in putting forth educational lectures. We
believe in patriotism, and think we ought
to teach our own children love of the flag
and the preservation of our country in its
purity and freedom for those who come
alter us."
The sentiment was loudly applauded,
after w*hich John A. McAuliffe sang "The
Holy City" so feelingly that he was re
called with much enthusiasm. He then
sang "The Lost Chord* with equal suc
cess.
The Arcn bishop then stepped forth and
began as follows:
"I am indeed proud to have the honor
of inaugurating this series of lectures, for
I have watched these young men with a
father's eye for many years, and I helped
to draft the constitution that governs your
body. [Cheers.] I can say there is noth
ing in it contrary to Americanism in its
noblest, purest sense.
"I hardly know how to begin here, or
just what to say. So many misrepresen
tations and calumnies have fallen from
this very platform. [Laughter.! I am
afraid that the truth, if I speak it from
here, will find itself lonesome. [Prolonged
laughter and cheering.] But I can say
that these young men have never allowed
their order to be used for political pur
poses. As supreme chaplain I should re
sign immediately if I should learn that
these young men had allowed their order
to be used for political purposes."
The speaker next devoted some atten
tion to various phases of the controversy
between Catholics and Protestants. He
said he knew there was a prevalent idea
"that the church does not keep pace with
the progress of the age." There is a vague
impression that the church lives in the
present as a mere relic of the past, and a
conviction that she cannot be a living fac
tor in affairs of the day. There is in many
places a belief that the average man can
not afford to listen to what they term the
church's ravings, because there is an in
compatibility between the spirit of the age
and the doctrines of the church, but this is
all wrong, all based on ignorance of his
tory and ignorance of facts.
"Let me call your attention to the fact,"
he continued, "that the idea that man is
a progressive being is found only in the
Jewish and Christian religions â not in
the pagan faiths with their golden age
ever in the dim past and their future ever
darkened. Furthermore, be it understood
that dogmatic Protestantism could not
construct a theory of progress. Why?
Because, when you preach the total de
pravity of man and destroy the doctrine
of free will, you dry up the wellsprings of
human progress and make man the mere
child of fate, the sport of blind chance.
"Personal independence is the first ele
ment of progress, and that idea the Catho
lic church has ever maintained. Then
comes the idea of the dignity of labor â the
right to attain to even ti.e highest social
position by industry alone, without refer
ence to blood or genealogy. You know
nearly all were slaves in pagan times.
Labor was not a dignity but a servility for
slaves, while the true citizen was excused
from toil. What changed these condi
tions? The cause is worth following.
"The Son of God came in a manger.
Labor then became a blessing, and since
then none have dared to despise the poor
laboring man, for that would be despising
Christ himself.
; 'â¢Christ brought the true idea of liberty
all equal before God, therefore all men are
. equal belore the law. Liberty was born
with the star of Bethlehem.
"The PÂ«,oman Empire was built on privi
leges and class legislation. Its rulers soon
realized the nature of the conflict for free
dom which Christ's coming inaugurated.
For 300 years the early founuers of the
church were butchered in the amphi
tneater. All through Paul you rind the
teachings of freedom â 'there ia neither
bond nor free.' Ah, my friends, at the
sound of these words the elements of
pagan civilization were dissolved. There
were to be no more posts of honor to tha
tyrant, no more privileges granted on
class distinctions.
"The church taught the people the dig
nity of labor and the great European
cities were founded by the monks. Theo
dore Parker, tne learned Boston Unitarian,
has vididly pictured the services of the
church, has told the story of how the
Catholics stood between the barons and
the people and took to her bosom ail tha
oppressed."
The Arcnbishop then dwelt at some
length on creeds and faith, saying: "Out
side of the Jewish and Catholic religions
there is no warrant whatever for any
faith. I see one great historic institution
in an unbroken line for ages, and it
speaks to me as a divine "institution.
Bishop as I am, were it not for this divine
faith I would deny all authority of men
and follow my own reason and conscience
aione. The Jewish faith ana ours are tbe
only ones, we accepting theirs and supple
menting it by the new revelation."
It was next contended that the church
has always been for liberty. "'The Cath
olic barons forced Magna Charter upon an
unwilling being, and in every age the
pontiffs have stood between tbe people
and their oppressors." The archbishop
continued: "True government comes
from the people and political power is a
trust for the good of the country. That
was taught by the Jesuits ages ago. And
in the new world our church has been for
freedom.
"The clause of our fundamental law
that gives all men the right to worship
God as they please did not come from
Plymouth Rock, not from the original
colonies, but it came from Maryland, from
the empire of Lord Baltimore, where the
Catholics won in their fight for freedom."
In conclusion the Archbishop thankrd
those of the Jewish faith "for recent aid
in the cause of liberty" and referred to the
fact that "some of the opposition are now
having their lives shown up in courts,"
and thanked Father Peter C. Yorke "for
bravery and eloquence. " The mention of
Father Yorke's name was the signal for
applause that lasted without a break for
two minutes.
In conclusion the Archbishop told a
beautiful story of the blue and the gray â
bow bands of both armies, after a battle of
rival tunes, joined in "Home, Sweet
Home." He urged men of every faith to
join in one great civil song, "My Country,
'Tis of Thee," and to forget disputes and
differences in the melody of one great
anthem of patriotic devotion.
MUSCULAR CHRISTIANS.
Athletic Tryoot Field-Day of the Tonne
SI en's Christian Association.

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Steve Brodie Is Drawing Large
Audiences at the Califor
nia Theater.
Herssracing at the Grand Opera-
Houseâ Miss Blanche Bates as a
Leading Lady.
Steve Brodie will probably not be added
to the list of disgruntled freak actors who
have complained that San Francisco
treats tnem to a "dead, cold frost." The
fact is that Brodie's box-office receipts for
his tirst three nights must have been very
large. The house last night was a top
heavy one â that is to say, standing room
in the gallery was at a premium. Lower
down the crush was not so great, but
there were very few vacant seats, even in
the orchestra.
As for the performance, it was the same
as on the opening night â "laugh and
tumble," as regards the scenes and char
acters. Brodie himself wins his audience
by the ingenious way in which he does
not even pretend to act. In the baroom
scene, where he is at his happiest, he dis
penses drinfcs as one to the manner born.
"The Wife," at the Columbia Theater,
has a special interest, as it serves to intro
duce Miss Blanche Bates in her new role
of leading lady. She has developed an
unsuspected amount of emotional power
lately, and though the ring of true feeling
is at times lacking, her performance on
the whole is extremely creditable and
shows, furthermore, what rapid progress
she has made in her art since she played
in "Sweet Lavender" a little over a year
ago.
Hope Ross plays the ingenue role in
"The Wife" particularly well. She is
another member of the Frawley Company
who is to be congratulated on her progress.
"Mme. Sans Gene" is still drawing well
at the Baldwin. Following the Sardou
play, on October 5, the Lyceum Theater
success, "The Prisoner of Zenda," will
come to the Market-street house.
The Grand Opera-bouse has not lost any
of its usual patronage this week on ac
count of the melodramatic attractions of
Steve Brodie's "On the Bowery." One
reason doubtless is that there are especially
fine realistic effects at the Grand in the
shape of the horserace.
"All the Comforts of Home" goes with
plenty of vim at the Alcazar this week.
The farce-comedy is not a new one, bat it
abounds with iun whicn has not grown
old, and as performed by the Belasco com
pany it affords lots of merriment to the
audience.
There was a large and critical audience
to see <: I1 Trovatore" at the Tivoli last
night. The applause showed that the per
formance did not fall short of expecta
tions. Maurice de Vries as the wicked
Count di Luna was the star of the opera,
though Mile. Ida Vaierga as Leonora also
came in for a large share of approbation.
Martin Pache made a fairly satisfactory
Manrico and the rest of the cast, was good.
The Orpheum's programme is practically
new this week, and most of the acts are
taking well. The "Pearless Mareuerite"
has become a prime favorite, and Bellman
and Moore have also made -a hit. It goes
without saying that Ferguson and Mack's
Irish kncck-about comedy act is received
with manifestations of joy by the gallery.
The performances given every evening
and on Wednesday, Saturday and Sun
day afternoons, in tde Casino at the Chutes
are clever and well attended. The princi
pal features are the Japanese acrobats, the
Masons, Korto the one-armed equilibust
and the mile bicycle race on the stage be
tween two young ladies. Antonio Pirri
rides down the chutes and into the lake
every night at 10 o'clock on his bicycle.
Nearly all the theaters gave matinee per
formances yesterday in honor of Admis
sion day.
Fetched Him.
Boggsâ Boys, I want to get a policeman
quick. There's never one around when
you want him, and there are thieves in my
barn.
Future diplomatâ Here, kids, get to
playing ball.
And before the hall had been passed a
half dozen times a big policeman came
around the corner on the dead run.âDe

THE PIONEERS
AT EL CAMPO
Successful Celebration of
Admission Day by the
'49-ers.
A GREAT THRONG THERE
Orator of the Day S. M. Short
ridge Makes a Telling
Address
AND STKIOS A HEAVY BLOW.
A Straw Vote Taken on the Boat
Elects McKinley by a Big
Majority.
El Campo saw a sight yesterday tbat
will probably be referred to forever in its
history as "that Admission day in '96."
Led by the Society of California Pioneers
a great throng of people in holiday dress
and holiday spirits â men, women and
children â spread itself out through the
groves of the beautiful resort, applauded
the orator, danced to the music and gen
erally did honor to the men who laid the
foundation of the commonwealth and to
the day they celebrate.
It was a beautiful day, beautifully cele
brated. The big ferry-boat Ukiah left her
wharf at 9:30 crowded wilh the merry
makers, ail her half-dozen flags flying and
Blum's big orchestra playing an inspirit
ing air.
The waters of the bay sparkled in the
sun and the colors of the craft anchored
and under way were heightened by it as
the exeursonists ran down past the Cnion
Iron Works to take a look at the Oregon
and otner craft stationed there. Return
ing close under Alcatraz, a landing was
made at Â£1 Campo a little before noon.
The great throng broke itself up into
luncheon parties, for the order of the day
had been. to "come provided."
It was nearly 1 o'clock when the assem
bly call was sounded and the concourse
gathered in the pavilion, where, after the
band had played a prelude, the president
of tne Society of Pioneers, Collis H. Root,
introduced the orator of the day, Samuel
M. fchomidee.
A burst of applause was followed by the
profound stillness of perfect attention.
Then the sonorous tones of the voice of
the orator filled the place, reaching to the
furthermost limits of the great . athering.
Mr. Shortridge was frequently interrupted
by bursts of applause that responded in
stantly as he touched the chord of patriot
ism or paid a tribute to the labors, the
achievements of and the honors due the
pioneers of the great Slate: Mr. Short
ridge said:
Mr. Chairman, .Ladies and Gentlemen:
Grateful to uod lor his manifoid blessings for
liberty, for all the precious fruits of civiliza
tion which we enjoy, proud of our State and
her achievements, we assemble here to-day,
matron and maid and sire and lad, to give ex
pression to our gratitude and to celebrate the
admission of California into our great and
enduring Union. We come irom all the differ
ent walks in liie. We are here with memories
carrying us back to homes scattered through
out the whole Union, to homes far beyond the
seas, but all united, all devoted, all proud of
our grand State of California. [Applause ]
We are here to c. lebrate in joy and thanks
giving the admission of California into the
sisternood of States. We are here to indulge
in pardonable pride in all we have accom
plished, all that we have done for civilization,
for the upliiting of man, for the opening of
avenues of labor and usefulness to women,
for all that we have accomplished foi the ben
efit of this State and her people. To me it is
an honor quite undeserved to be permitted to
pay a brief tribute to California and her
founders. We come to pay a poor tribute to
the noble meu and noble women to whose suf
fering, to whose dauntless spirit, to whose toil
and tears are due all tne glory of our State â
all we uave to-day, all we hope to have iv the
future. [Applause.] We are here to pay a
poor tribute to the pioneers oi California [ap
plause], to the men and the women who
turned their eves westward and here and upon
this western slope, wiihin sound of the man
ifold voices of the sea, planted the standard of
Christian civilization, under whose ample
folds we rejoice to-day. [Applause.]
Thus assembled, our minds turn backward
and we think of the early days of California.
We think of a time prior to 1849, aud the
quiet and dreamy civilization that flourished
here. We think of the news that went speed
ing over the mountains, across the plains, on
across the seas to all the people of th^ earthâ
the news of the discovery of gold in this S'.ate;
and in our hearts and through our lips we
pay a tribute to Marshall, the discoverer of
gold. [Applause.] I cannot here, on this oc
casion, dwell at any length upon the eflect of
that news upon the world. Many of the gray
haired men and women before me lived at
that time and remember the condition of the
country and the effect of that news upon them
and the world.
Let this be recorded, as, indeed, it will be
recorded, that the westward march of the pio
neers was in a cause as inspiring, as praise
worthy, as noble as ever engaged the thoughts
or labors of men in all the history of the
world. Not for a sordid purpose, not for gain
merely did the pioneer turn his eye west
ward; no, he came here out of love of country
out of love of home to plant civilization, and
to lay the foundation of a great common
wealth. [Applause.] The story of that west
ward march, the toil, the tears, ihe struggles
the loug, weary long march across the plains,
over unbroken prairies, through undiscovered
canyons, over rocky mountains, tnrongh dark
ness and storm and dangers, is a theme to en
gage the pen of the poet, and to call forth all
the efforts of eloquence. That journey was
heroic; that army was composed of heroes.
You found a civilization hospitable and
generous, but not of the East. They, our
Spanish predecessors, had love of country, but
if there are descendants of th. m to-day here
assembled they must rejoice at the planting
of the banner of the morning stars here upon
this const.
How our State grew in wealth and numbers
you know full welL The pioneers came here
in search of gold, but they brought with tnem
a love of law, a love of order, a belief in free in
stitutions, a faith in constitutional govern
ment. Early a convention was called to frame
a constitution. A constitution was drafted
whose foundations were laid in justice and
equity and liberty, and whose every stone and
pillar was dedicated to the rights of man and
to Christian civilization. [Applause.]

Pioneers, rapped at the door of Congress and
asked to be admitted Into the glorious Union.
What a struggle, what strife, what opposition,
what passions were engendered. Let us joy
fully remember that the State, by its constitu
tion, was dedicated to freedom, and that it
came into the Union with the garments of
freedom around her. Let us proudly remem
ber that our soil has never been pressed by the
feet of other than free meu. Goa bless Henry
Clay; God bless Seward; God bless all the
grand patriots of that hour who struggled and
lough t for the admission of our State with a
constitution dedicated to freedom.
Admitted into the Union, our progress has
been the wonder and the admiration of the
world. These populous ci'ies, these flourish
ing villages, these hillsides, these great fertile
valleys, our churches, our colleges, our courts
are the enduring monuments to you, Pioneers
of California. [Applause.]
Our State was founded by men, I repeat, who
believed in law and in orderâ who believed in
the laws which they had either enacted or
obeyed in their Eastern homes. You came
from the fertile South; from rock-ribbed New
England. You came from the prairies of the
West. You came from all quarters of our
common Union, and you came bearing in your
hands and in your hearts a be.ief in Christian
civilization and here you planted her stand
ard.
Prom the hour of its admission into the
Union in 1850 our State has always been true
to the principles which were crystalized in
her constitution. We have advanced not only
in a material sense; we have not only bur
rowed through our mountains to extract the
precious metals; we have not only tilled our
fields to brin? forth their rich fruits; we have
not only builded cities, but we have erected
courts of justice and maintained them; we
have erected colleges and sent forth men and
women who are an honor and a light to the
State; we have established a system of public
schools where rich and poor, high and low, ot
whatsoever color, may drink atjtiie fountain of
learning. [Appluuse.]
And lv every city and in every village the
spires pointing heavenward are evidences of
the lact that we have taught religious truth,
and, while attempting in a material way to
better our condition, have pointed the way to
a blessed immortality. As, in a material sense,
the btate has progressed so, intellectually, the
State has risen, morally the State has grown.
in all that goes to make an intelligent and
righteous people California stands to-day
proudly beside her sisters of the Union. [Ap
piause.] And whatsoever we have of which we
are proud, whatsoever we have that makes the
youth of this State grateful, whatsoever we
possess that makes us hopeful, we owe iv full
measure to the pioneer men and women who
laid the foundation of this magnificent com
monwealth.
We think to-day of the progress made. In
population we have increased; in all the ma
terial comforts we have surpassed all other
States in the Union. God feave usâ he has
spread out before us to-day the grandest State
upon the rolling earth. [Applause.] .We
have here that which you early recognizedâ
not only wealtn of the mountains but greater
perennial, unfailing wealth of the valleys aud
of the sea. Our mountains, standing like sen
tinels of liberty, have given ironi their coffers
wealth to enrich the State and the world. But
while our mountains may (though it will be
long and far distant)â while they may become
exhausted of their wealth, our great fertile
valleys and this rich, frothful sea will be here
as long as God permits the earth to roll in its
orbit. Ana these are the stories of our wealth,
the mountains, the valleys and the sea.
Pioneers of California, pioneers in planting
civilization, pioneers in the discovery and in
the mining of the precious metals, pioneers in
the culture of the valleys, pioneers in com
merce, you have set an example tor this and
for future generations. In your devotion to
material things you have never lost sight of
these truths; that there are some things more
precious than gold; there are some things
more to be desired than silver; there are some
things dearer and more precious than the
material things oi earth. You have taught us
that truth and justice and liberty are the
things that ennoble, crown and dienify the
human race. [Applause.] And our ehufrches
to-Jay, from who^e pulpits ris>e upon the
breath of prayer, thanks to man aud
grwtitude to God â colleges which are send
ing forth a stream of light to illumine this
western world â our churches and schools
are preaching that which, the pioneers
preached, that which the pioneers taught.
They came here bearing the civilization,
loving New England, tne Eastern, the Middle
and the Southern .SLates, leaving behind them
the memories of youth, the farmhouse, the
little churchyards where their fatners sleepâ
came here to buiid homes, to found a State.
And we to-day can show but poor gratitude by
word of praise, i' will be poor gratitude to
pronounce the word of eulogy unless we dedi
cate ourselves to the great work which they
commenced.
The young men and young women of this
State have In the pioneer fathers and mothers
of California an example of industry and of
labor which they may profitably emulate.
Oh, pioneers, you who stood at the cradle of
the State, who rocked its infancy, who nur
tured, who sustained it, be of good cheer!
Though age is whitening your locks, though
your eyes are not bright, your steu not firm,
your form not erect and strong, as in otner
days, yet do you live in the hearts, and you
will forever live in the memory aud gratitude
of your children. [Great apulaust.]
On this great day of celebration we cannot
pronounce the names of the many men who
took part iv building this our commonwealth.
Many rote to high and distinguished (.laces,
many represented the State in executive
chairs, many spoke for her in legislative halls.
Many have pursued the more quiet and, per
haps, the more desiraole pathways of private
life. Many have carved their way as pioneers
of science, and borne her sacred torch far to
the front. Mauy have established institutions
of learning which will be a light for all the
Children of men throughout the years to come.
And as we stand or sii here with this
beaut ful expanse oi water stretching before
us, almost within hearing of yonder ocean, we
think at this moment of him, "your benefactor
the benefactor of this Society of Caliicrnia
Pioneers and of Californiaâ the benefactor of
all mankind â of him who sleeps yonder under
the silent stars upjn Mount Hamilton. [Ap
plause.] And bo long as the sun in his coming
shall kiss and glorify our mountain-tops, so
long as yonder sea rolls in and breaks upon
the Golden Gate, so long as the stars look
down sentinel above his tomb, so long will
future generations remember with gratitude
the benefactions of James Lick. [Applause.]
Pioneers, we have not erected a monument
to you ; we cannot erect a tui'.abie monument
to you. If there be any monument worthy of
you it is the great State which you have
founded, the great institutions of learning
which you have planted, the great super
structure of civil government which you
have erectea. We cannot hope on this occa-
S;On to dwell in deiail upon the progress of
our State. It is in evidence before us. It is in
evidence in our increasing commerce, in our
manufactories, in the increasii g acreage of
our fields, in tne increasing domestic com
merce within our borders and reaching toward
the East and the West. We are progressing
materially, intellectually and, let us hone and
believe, morally.
The younger generation can do no more than
to keep the State where you have left it. We
can do no more than to strive to do that, and
with earnest devotion and with a zeal perhaps
to be compared with yours, we can Btrive to
plant the banner of civilization a little further
onward and a little higher upon the mountain
heights of prosperity aud righteousness. [Ap
plÃU6C]
An occasion such as this, fellow-citizens,
should not be passed by without causing us to
think of our duties. The pioneer's work has
not been fully performed, thougn he is entitled
to rest and praiie. The work which he com
menced must be carried forward. The young
men and the young women of this State must
look to tnat example and follow it. The
young men ana the young women upon whom
will rest the responsibilities of government
must see to it that the work of the pioneer
fathers and mothers is carried on, and that the
State's interests, materially and intellectually,
shall be guarded and deiended.
I have no fear, nor should you pioneers have
fear that in the keeping of the-native sons
and native daughters of this State, and in the
keeping of the young men and young women
who hail from other States ttie welfare of Cali
fornia will be safe. [Applause.] Foriv-six
years ago our State was admitted into the* Un
ion. Forty-six years ago she was clothed with
Statehood and entered into a generous rivalry
with Ms'erS.ates. I undertake to say and I
do proudly say that no Btate in the Union has
done more for charity, more for the poor and
suffering than our State of California. [Ap
plause.]
This State, fellow-citizens, has gathered to
her men of all races, oi all the States of the
Lnion, and practically ol all the countries and
nations of the earth. We have stood true and
steadfast. He have been threatened at times
with an inundation from the East, we were
threatened with a tidal wave which would
have swallowed up our churches, our colleges,
our Christian civilization. We were threat
ened witn a wave which would have engulfed
the State and lost it to you aud to :;.e, but the
spirit that founded this State, that put her
into the Lnion, triumphed, and Christian
civilization and not Asiatic barbarism flour
ishes in California to-day. [Applause 1
And so we are here to think of our progress,
to take note of the journey and particularly
to rejoice upon our ttdra ission into the Union
It seems to me that the heart of the pioneer
must swell with pride when he thinks of the
work that has been done ana reflects that he
was a participant in that glorious work. And
it neems to me that thedyingeye of the pioneer
might well be lighted up with'asmile when he
thinns that he will be embalmed torever in the
love and gratitude of those wio follow him.
[Applause.]
Pioneers of California, you who came here
in early days, you who have done this great
work, you who have laid many of your fel
lows away forever we here to-day pay you the
poor tribute of your love and prais"-. No
words can tell you, no eulogy can portray, no
flight of fancy or words from the heart can ex
press the deep sense of gratitude which we
your children feel toward you, and the rever

ence In which we have placed you. [Ap
plause.]
We, the young men and women are here,
the young people of California are here
to pay you this tribute and to bid you be of
good cheer; to be proud of the work which
you have wrought.
Californians, ladies and gentlemen, this to
us should be a day of thanksgiving as well as
of rejoicing. It should be a day of tears, but
not tears of agony. 1 1 should be a day of re
joicing, and I borrow the thought, as you will
perceive, of our greatest statesman, day of
exultation and of gratitude.
We should not let this day pass without re
dedicating ourselves to the great work before
us, and that work is the building up of the
State and the preservation of all that we have,
and the reaching out for that which is better
and more to be desired.
We should here to-day, fellow-citizens, con
secrate ourselves to our State and, oh, it to me
is a proud thought that through all the
aangers which our dear country has passed, in
the darkest hour, in the wildest storm, in
darkness, and in doubt, California stood, es
she will ever stand, for the constitution and
the union. [Great applause.]
And now, lellow-citizens, what is our great
overshadowing duty ? It is to hold high aloft
the banner of civilization; it is to hold hich
aloft in the forefront of the nations of the earth
the great and blessed glorious banner of civili
zation. And what is that banner? Thank
God, it is the banner of our fathers, the Star
spangled Banner ol the Nation. [Great ap
piause.J
The banner which is emblematic of the
struggles, of the sufferings, of the tears, of the
triumphs of the mothers and the fathers of the
Revolution; the banner which is emblematic
oi freedom to worship God in temple or in
forest, freedom of conscience, free lips aud free
hands; the banner emblematic of an indis
soluble Union and indestructable State.
And so here to-day, on this 9th of Septem
ber, in this year of our Lord 1896, let us utter
a fervent prayer that the State may endure,
that she may grow in wealth materially, that
she may advance in all the civic virtues; that
her constitution may always be preserved;
that her institutions of learning may be pre
served ; that her people may be prosperous and
righteous, and that this banner of our civiliza
tion may forever float above our fertile valleys
and from our maun tain tops, over a happy, a
righteous, an independent people.
Our State of California, may she ever stand
lor light, for progress and for liberty.
Prolonged applause followed and ttie
band burst into a medley of patriotic airs.
Miss Frazie Cleveland, a daughter of C.
D. Cleveland, recited in a very telling
manner the poem of the day, written by
her father and entitled "The Pioneer.' 1
She was warmly applauded.
Now the stage was cleared, the orchestra
got in tune with Strauss and dancing was
begun and continued until the whistle
blew for the return at 5 o'clock.
The celebration was on the whole one
of the most successful in the history of
the society. The committee in charee
was composed of: E. T. Kruge (chairman)
R. Vandercook, C. M. Plum, C. J. Kine,
Peer Tiffany and John F. Pinkham. Mr.
Vandercook served as floor manager for
the dancing.
A poll was taken of the men on the boat
who wished to vote, the result being: For
McKinley 201, Bryan 66, Palmer 1, for
woman suffrage 140, against 121.
It might be mentioned that there is a
striking machine at El Campo for a test of
strength, a creat iron-bound sledge being
used. Among the athletes who hammered
the thing ail day but one man "rang the
bell," striking the heaviest blow possible
on the machine. George H. Cabaniss
struck the next best blow, 2250, and S. M.
Shortridge, his Prince Albert buttoned up
to the collar as he appeared before his
audience, came next, striking 2150. The
feat was greeted with as hearty applause
as was the best turned period of his
oration.
The last of the excursionists arrived in I
the City shortly after 6 o'clock, and the
Admission day picnic of the pioneers for I
1896 was over.
DR. BROWN'S SUCCESSOR
Rev. Dr. Adams of St Louis to
Be Called as Temporary
Supply.
Apparent Unarrm ty of Action by
the Divided Membership of the
First Church.
Deacon Morse has at last been check
mated. Thoee members of the First Con
gregational Society known during the
Brown trial as the "opposition" have
made their demand that the church build
ing be opened and that demand has been
heeded.
Last night the prayer-meeting of the
society wes held in the church building.
Mr. Morse, as senior deacon, presided.
The usual hymns and testimonies were
given, after which the business meeting
convened.
Deacon Morse opened the proceedings
by reading a quantity of correspondence
having reference to the supplying of the
First Congregational pulpit. The first let
ter was from Edward Kimball, formerly a
mmber of the First Congregational
Church of this City, but now of St. Louis.
He said he had beard of the present sad
state of affairs in the church lately under
the pastoral charge of Dr. Charles O.
Brown, and recommended that the Rev.
Dr. Geor/e C. Adams of St. Louis be asked
to supply the pulpit for the time being.
Some other correspondence was read,
and at length a letter from Dr. Adams was
repeated to the assembly. The reverend
ppntleman said his present salary was
$3500 a year, and he would expect at least
an equivalent should he come to this City,
seeing that he had occupied the pulpit of
the ComDton Congregational Church in
St. Louis for the past fifteen years at that
salary.
Rev. Mr. Warren said he had heard Mr.
Adams preach, and regarded him as a
most desirable man for the place.
Deacon Barnard agreed with Mr.
Warren. He said Dr. Adams had built up
a uowerful church in St. Louis, and would
be just the man tor the place.
Other speakers followed in the same
strain, after which Mr. Warren moved
that Dr. Adams be called to supply the
pulpit. The motion being? seconded by
Attorney Charles G. Nagle was put to a
vote and carried unanimously.
It is expected ttiat the Rev. Dr. Adams
will arrive here within a fortnight. Mean
while members of the church are anxi
ously awaiting the action of the Bay Con
ference at its meeting in December.

TOM GEARY BOLTS
TWO BAD PLANKS
He Flatly Refuses to Stump
the State for
Bryan.
REASONS FOR DECLINING
Cannot Indorse the Anarchistic
Platform of the Rump
Democracy.
REPUBLICANS IN SOLID LINE.
The Democratic Party in California
Demora ized â A Tidal Wave
of Home Rule.
As surely as the tides in the bay ebb
and flow, so surely is the tide of protection
rising all over California, and it will con
tinue to rise until it reaches its flood on
the 3d of next November.
The Democratic forces are already demor
alized beyond repair. Every day comes the
news of some well-known life-long Demo
crat breaking away from the party of
anarchy and free trade, and demanding
that the languishing industries of the Pa
cific Coast be rehabilitated. The scouts
sent out through the community by the
Democratic leavers have returned with
discouraging reports, to the effect that
citizens generally decline to trust the
affairs of the country into the hands of
the Democracy for another four years.
The latest gap in the front rank is the
passive defection of ex-Congressman
Thomas J. Geary of the First District.
Mr. Geary was requested by the Demo
cratic State Central Committee to stump
the State for Bryan and free trade, and
politely declined. When asked for iis
reasons, he replied that he was neither a
gold Democrat nor a silver Democrat, but
a Democrat of the old school, and he could
not by a public appearance on the stump
during the present campaign lend hia
assent to the plant in the Chicago plat
form denouncing the Supreme Court of
the United Statesâ a plank which had too
much of a Jack Cade flavor to be indorsed
by any conservative, law-abiding citizen.
It taupht contempt oi the hig eat legal
tribunal in the land, the overthrow of
which would be a fatal blow at the
liberties of the people.
Mr. Geary also refused to support the
plank condemning President Cleveland
lor calling out the United States troops to
remove the obstructions to the forward
ine of the United States mails.
Mr. Geary declares himself out of poli
tics during this campaign. He will be a
looker on, and there is a suspicion afloat
that he will not weep when Major McKin
ley shall have been declared duly elected
President of the United States.
The Republican party of this State is
splendidly organized and is doing excel
lent campaign work. Workingmen and
business men have had their eyes opened
to the preat necessity lor protection.
Italian, French, German, Scandinavian
and Spanish newspapers published in this
City and read by a constituency number
ing 50.000, have hoisted the banner of Mc-
Kinley and protection and are doing good
work every day with hammer and tongs
for the cause. Already a. Gormen McKin
ley club has been organized with an active
subscribing membership of 1800, and nat
uralized citizens of the other nationalities,
notably the Spanish and Italian, have
formed themselves voluntarily into clubs
in order to push on the good work.
The iatest example of growing strength
is the organization in this City a few even
ings ago of a club composed almost exclu
sively of Democrats who have repudiated
Bryan and free trade and who have volun
tarily pledged themselves to make the
fight for protection to Dome products.
They are tired of the competition of Eng
lish pauper labor.
Edward Baker of Los Angeles visited
the rooms of the Republican State Central
Committee yesterday afternoon and made
a good report of the feeling in that county.
The Democrats were very noisy down
there, but the Republicans were quietly
doing much *>ff' ctive work.
W. W. Studder of Petaluma reports that
around tlie best poultry center in the
State the majority of the farmers, labor
ers and business men are for protection
and will render a good account of them
selves on election day.
James J. Dolan of Conlterville, formerly
a hotbed of free trade and Democracy,
finds an entirely different condition of
affairs in that vicinity now. The wool
raisers and others have had an object les
son as to the beauties oi the Democratic
system of tariff for revenue oniy, and
they have been hit so hard in the pocket
by it that they will not soon forget the
experience. The demand for the protec
tion of home products and home rule for
America regardless of the interests of
British manufacturers is growing 3tronger
and more persistent every day.
Hart Downer, editor bf the Crockett
Record, a sturdy Republican, has a good
word to say about the ioyalty of his part
ol the State. Republicanism is all right
in Crockett.
What's the mutter with Crockett T
O'Bryan and Sewall can't knock it
Nor can the Democracy stock It:
And thai's what's tne man r with Crockett.
Poetical San Franciscans are composing
campaign doggerel. The following are the
latest instances:
There was a young man from Nebraska;
He could drive all th- seals from Alaska,
Wl.h the wind of his jaw
And the noisy hee-baw
That declared him to be a jaekasska.
There wasa yount; spontar from Lincoln
Who went to New \ork with a think on:
But when he cot there
Not a man, I declare.
Cared a for the spouter from Lincoln.
Colored Republicans In Line.
The colored Republicans of California
will formally open the campaign for Mc-
Kinley and Hobart by a monster mass
meeting, to be held next Monday night at
the Auditorium, corner of Jones and
Eddy streets, under the ausDices of the
Afro-American League. The speakers of
the evening as now announced are Hon.
George A. Knight, Rev. H. J. Coliis, W.
E. Henderson and Hon. Thomas Pearson.
All the white Republican clubs in the City
have been invited to attend, special invita
tions being issued to the Ingleside McKin
ley Club, Women's Afro-Arneriran League,
and the Colored American McKinley Ciub.
The gallery and stage have been reserved
for the ladies and their escorts, so it is ex
pected tbat a large number of the gentler
sex will be in attendance. T. B. Morton
of the Afro-American League has been se
lected as the president of tne evening.
Now in San Quentin.
John But'.er was consigned to San Quentin
from the Connty Jail yesterday. Butler's
crime was burglary, for which he was sen
tenced to ten vears' penal servitude by Judge
Troutt last Tuesday.
