RADICALS TRY TO
OVERTHROW MELINE
But the Attempt to Force
Out the Cabinet Is a
Failure.
Policy of the French Government
. Upheld Alter a Hot Debate
Among Deputies.
â¢PECULIAR GROUND OF ATTACK
Clergymen Given the Right to Hold
Ccngresses While It Is Denied
Teachers and Others.
PARIS, France, Nov. 12.â The radical
groups in the Chamber of Deputies to-day
â  made an unsuccessful attemnt to over
' throw the Government. The radicals
have for a long time been scheming to
. . oust the Meline Cabinet for no very obvi
. ous reason beyond a desire to secure the
official loaves and fishes for themselves.
On Tuesday last, as detailed in the dis
' patches of the United Associated Presses,
the Chamber decided by a majority of
. nineteen to discuss on Monday the mode
;. of electing Senators. The Government
opposed the proposal, but :: snap division
resulted in its adoption. Ihe Government
did not take the action of the Chamber as
an expression of want of confidence, and
no serious result followed its dofeat. This
move on the part of the -Chamber was an
â¢'incident in the maneuvers of tne radicals
to force M. Meline and his colleagues out
jof office, and it anticipated an interpella-
tion offered to-day by M. Levi Mirman, the
radical socialist, who sits for one of the
: .â¢ districts of Rheims.
The Repub'.ique Francaise, M. Meline's
organ, published an article yesterday
etiongly attacking the opponents of the
Chamber. It charges them with darkly
conspiring against the Cabinet and with
. laying snares every day to entrap the
* Government. It challenges them to openly
attack thp policy of tl:e Government and
â¢ to mnke charges against It from the tribune
of the Chamber. The article, which was
a vigorous one, hurled defiance at the
radicals and concluded by calling upon
them to disclose their policy.
The ground for to-day's attack was the
question of the Government permitting
'priests, although they are State officials, to
hold congresses, which the members of
the Left regard as being tantamount to
formins tradis-unions, while at ihe same
tit^e the Government will not allow the
v. mversita'res to found associations or
ho.d congresses. It was this question
which brought out the interpellation by
M. Mirman.
The groups of the Left met yesterday to
discuss what action they would take on
the interpellation. Mirman addressed the
members of the Extreme Left, who
pledged themselies to support his inter
pellation. The other groups showed a
disposition to support it, but were not
wholly unanimous.
The galleries were filled with an inter-
esting audience, and the debate was
closely followed by every one present.
Every seat of the members was occupied,
and it was evident that the Opposition en
tertained hish hopes of forcing M. Meline
and his follow-Ministers to visit the Pal
ace of the Elysee to band their resigna
â  tions to President Faure â hopes that were
doomed to disappointment when a vote
wag taken on the interpellation, as the 1
1 Chamber gave a majority of ninety-nine
to the Government. -
M. Mirraan's chief point of attack was
the clerical congresses recently held at
Kheims. at which a cr-.isade against the
republic was preached. Nevertheless, the
Government refused to professors- and
schoolteacher! the right to hold a con
gress '-'] , ; : ./ I .:_ 1-^
Upon the conclusion of M. Mirman's
speech M. Rambaud. Minister of Public
Instruction and Worship, ascended ihe
tribune arid briefly replied to the interpel
lation. The point of his remarks was a
btatement that it was bis intention io in-
troduce a measure to the Chamber, au
â¢ thorizing teachers to form a mutual aid
' society and to hold certain congresses.
This statement was greeted with ap
plause.
M. Darlan, Minister of Justice, followed
M. Rarnbaud. He asserted that only one
of ihe congresses held at Rheims had
taken an attiinde of which the Govern
ment could disapprove. One clergyman
whose remarks had been particularly of
. fensive bad since been censured and his
stipend stopped. The Hishoi s, he added,
had been notified that they must prevent
the recurrence of any similar performance
-at future congresses or other church
Catherines- M. Darlan further said that
the Government would do its duty in se
curing respect for the country's institu
tions and for the protection of the rights
of civil society.
Tue Center oarty manifested its appro
val of TA. Darlan's statements by cheering
him loudly.
Abbe Jules Lemire attempted to make a
defense of the clergy, but was met with
cries of "closure."
M. Bourgeois, ex-Prime Minister, pro
tested against the closinc of the debate
and he was supported by Prime Minister
Meline. The latter attacked the Catholics,
. who were conducting a movement against
civil society.
M. Meline declared that he welcomed
.the discussion, as it gave the Charaoer an
opportunity to Fay whether tho Govern
ment possessed its confidence. He repu
diated the charge that he encouraged
clerical propaganda, maintaining that he
did not do any more than l;ad his prede
cessors in his office, but, he added, he
/could not war on relicion. He was con
/vincod that tho Chamber would approve
VilaY ila iQlicy, which accorded with the imer-
S of the country.
The Center again cave voice to its ap
proval in cheers as M. Meiine descended
from the tribune.
M. Alexandre Millerand, Radical Re
publican Socialist, made a violent attack
uron the Government.
Minister Rambaud essayed to reply, but
The San Francisco Call
the cries of "closure" became so loud and
insistent that he finally yielded.
Five orders of the day were presented,
but M. Meline declined to accept any of
them but on* offered by M. Poincaro, ex-
Minister of Public Instruction, the g^st of
which was that the Chamber approved
the declarations of the Government, trust
ing that it would insure respect for the
rights of the state.
If. Gustave Isambert, Radical Repub
lican, demanded priority lor his order of
the day, implying censure of the Govern
ment. This was rejected by a vote of 301
to 229, and M. Poincare's order expressing
confidence in the Government was adopt
ed by a vote of 325 to 225.
M. Mirman proposed to add a clause to
M. Poincare's order, but it was rejectedâ
301 to 176.
UNCLE SAM'S SUPREMACY.
France Does Not Relish the Outcome of
the Vexed Venezuelan Boundary
Controversy.
PARIS, France, Nov. 12.â The Temps,
in an article on the proposed settlement
by arbitration of the Antrlo- Venezuelan
question, remarks upon the immense im
pulsion Great 13ritam is giving to one of
the most extreme consequences of the
Monroe doctrine. It contends that with
ths consent of Great Britain the United
States are invested with the right to inter
lere in all territorial quarrels o f European
powers with New Wo r ld states, even when
not asked by the latter and without their
consent.
These great innovations in international
law, the paper adds, consecrate the abso
lute supremacy of the United States in
the Western Hemisphere, and must cost
British pride dear. Europe, however,
will be unable to accept such a grave de
parturs from the rights of nations.
LONDON, Eng.. Nov. 12.â The Daily
News will to-morrow say that rumors are
current of a resumption of diplomatic re
lations between Great Britain and Ven
ezuela.
The New York correspondent of the
Standard allirms that instead of entering
upon a contract with Venezuela or the
United States, Great Britain will sign an
agreement with both. The Anglo-Ameri
can document will be technically a treaty.,
it will merely ba a protocol for preparing
an Anglo-Venezuelan treaty.
This is owing to the delay that will arise
in the ratification of a treaty through the
peculiar Venezuelan laws. The progress
of the arbitration will thus be greatly fa
cilitated, since the protocol will stipulate
that the findings of the arbitration court
muÂ«t be completed before FeDruary 9.
Each instrument will refer to the other,
compelling them to be construed together,
but the less formal document is the more
important of the two.
G. F. Wheeler, the eminent barrister
and chief clerk of the Privy Council, in an
interview on the subject of the probable
composition of the Venezuelan arthitra
tion tribunal as far as Great Britain is con
cerned, informed a representative of the
United Associated Presses to-day that it
was an unusual thing for Judges to sit
upon arbitration tribunals, it was more
tban likely, he thougat, that eminent in
ternational jurists, such as Sir R. W An
son, warden of All Souls College, Oxford,
and Lord Davey, Lord of Appeals in Ordi
nary, would be appointed, though the Jat
ter would possibly refuse to serve.
ANTAGONISM NOT INTENDED.
Lord Lonsdale Explains the Telegram Sent
by Emperor William to Presi
dent Kruger.
LONDON. E.vg., Nov. 12:â The Daily
News will to-morrow comment upon a re
. 'arkable speech made by Lord Lonsdale,
who is an intimate friend of Emperor
William, upon retiring from the mayor
alty of White Haven. He denounced as
childish the anger that had been aroused
in England by the telegram sent some
months ago by Emperor William to Presi
dent Kruger of the Transvaal.
He declared that the fnct was that Presi
dent Kruger had asked Emperor William
to assist tho Transvaal in its trouble with
Great Britain, and that the Emperor de
clined to do so. Subsequently the Em
peror sent the dispatch merely congratu
lating President Kruger for coping with
the trouble alone. Lord Lonsdale added
that he believed if the Emperor had
known the result the thing would have
had in Great Britain he would not have
r*ent it. Anyhow, he was authorized by
Emperor William to declare that nothing
in the smallest degree antagonistic of
Great Britain or the British people was
intended.
UNDER ASSUMED NAMES.
Mr. and Mrs. Castle to Adopt That Plan in
Order to Outwit Curiosity-
Seekers.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 12. â Bernard
Abrams, counsel for the defense in the
case of Mrs. Walter M. Castle, has sent to
the offices of the United Associated
Presses the foiiowing communication:
"It would appear from a summary of
the opinions of the American press, pub
lished in yesterday afternoon's paper,
that surprise is felt that Mrs. Castle, In
view of the medical opinion, should have
been instructed to plead guilty. The pres
ent state of EiiElish law in regard to in
sane prisoners has been overiooked. Sir
Edward Clarke stated in court that if the
Jaw of England stood as it did in 1883 he
would have advised his client to plead not
guilty and would have contested the case,
so as to show to the jury that she was not
responsible for what she did in conse
quence of her mental state.
"She wouid have been, therefore, en
titled to a verdict of not guilty in view of
the absence of felonious intent, which the
English law regards as essential.
"An act was passed in 1883 relating to
the trial of lunatics, providing that a jury
shall return a verdict that the accused
was guilty at the lime of committing the
act of which he was accused, though in
sane. Thereupon the court must record a
verdict and order the accused to bo im
prisoned during her Majesty'- pleasure.
In view of the extraordinary and inhuman
state of the law, Mrs. Castle's advisers de
cided to enter the plea of guilty. English
legal circle-; approve the course taken."
Mr. and Mrs. Castle hope to sail from
Southampton on Saturday, but if pursued
by cimosi tv-seekers will sail from France
under assumed names.
Orer a Million Starving.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 12â A Bombay
dispatch says that a million and a quarter
of people are believed to be on the verge
of starvation in eleven districts of the
Deccan and Concan. Rio cs have occurred
at Shehebad ixud K/.zod.
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 13, 1896.
GENERAL WEYLER
REPORTS VICTORY
Claims to Have Driven the
Rebels From the Heights
of Rubi.
Rather Elaborate Story of Rout
ing the Enemy at the Point
of the Bayonet
BUT THE PATRIOTS WILL WIN.
With His Two Hundred Thousand
Men the Spanish Batcher Cannot
Check the Rebellion.
HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 12.â General
Weyler reports from Can abas that in
order to carry forward his plans he sent
out three columns. One column of six
battalions, with artillery, under command
of General Munoz, marched to Manuelita,
and another of four battalions, with artil
ery, under General Echadue, maiched to
Cay a ja bos.
Colonel BegurÂ«, with his command from
Soroa, and General Wevler himself at the
head of a column comprising five bat
talions and six pieces of artillery, left
Marel to attack the front of the enemy,
who occupied all of the avenues of com
munication in strong force. General
Echaclue, with his command, arrived near
CayajaboÃ on the evening of November 9
and found that the enemy was encamped
in a strong position on Kosano Hill. He
opened a sustained lire upon tne enemy's
position and as the action was about fin
ished a stray shot wounded General Echa
due in the right leg.
On the morning of November 10 Gen
eral Echadue wa3 re-enforced and captured
the rebel positions, which were strongly
defended, and the heights of Rubi, occu
pied by the rebels, were carried by the
Spanish, at the point of the bayonet, at 4
o'clock in the morning.
The Spanish losses were six killed and
eight officers and iifty-four privates
wounded. Seven of the enemy's dead
were found, but it is not known whether
there were any more killed.
SPAIN IN DESPERATE
Willing to Fight Vttele Sam to freserre
Prestige.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 12.â A Trib
une special from Washington says: The
Madrid Government has known for some
time that tho struggle to suppress the
revolution in Cuba will not be successful.
â¢ General Weyler has recently been
urged on to more energetic efforts by the
Madrid authorities, and telegrams from
Havana now announce that he has taken
the field in person. But well-informed
persons who have Leen in Cuba and who
know the situation thoroughly say that
Weyler and nearly 200,000 troops cannot
put down the revolution, and that he has
made no decided progress since relieving
General Campos.
The Spanish Government is endeavor
ing to keep up a bold front, but it sees the
humiliating word "failure" written en
the wall. Cuba is a Spanish province,
and the Government which shows that it
is incapable of putting down a rebellion iv
the island is doomed to oblivion.
This is a grave question for Premier
Canovas' Cabinet to face. It must face it,
however, and it is doing so with com*
Uncle Samâ Now, Grover, tell the truth*
mendable courage and determination.
But that hour is approaching when it
must stand before the poople of Spain and
admit that it can no longer bold Cuba.
That will be a uisastrous admission for
the Government to make, but an advanta
geous one to Don Carlos. When made the
overthrow of the present Ministry will
certainly and quickly foilow if it appears
thA ( r theGove^iinent Permitted the Cuban
insurgents to win their independence un
aided by foreign assistance.
But if Cuba is lost to Spain as a result
of a war with the United States, tne Gov
ernment will rot lose prestige at home.
Spain would certainly be vanquished in
such a conflict. But the Government
would say in the hour of defeat and the
Spanish will believe that the Cubans
would havo been held in subjection had
not American arms prevailed over -those
of Spain. Therefore it would be good
policy, and, from the Government's point
of view, patriotic, to bring on hostilities
with this couutry. Alfonso would lose
Cuba, but he would gain popularity
among his people â an advantage dearer to
him and his adherents than the Queen of
the Antilles.
MADRID, Spain, Nov. 12.â Prime Min
ister Canovas del Castillo denies emphati
cally that the Spanish Government has
announced that it will suppress the revo
lution on the island of Cuba within a
specified time.

WILLIAM SWEARS
IN THE TROOPS
Solemn Ceremony by the
German Emperor in
the Lustgarten.
After Administering the Oath
the Kaiser Delivers an
Address.
"I AM YOUR LORD CF WAR."
Recruits Plainly Told That They Must
Honor the Man of " Diyine
Rights."
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 12.â The Em- |
peror performed the ceremony of swear-:
ing in the troops in the Lustgarten at 2:30
this afternoon in the presence of the Em- !
press, Grand Duke Vladimir of Russia,
who wore the uniform of the Hussar Regi
ment, the Siamese Field .Marshal and the
imperial princes, who occupied the bal
cony of the palace facing the lieid altar,
before which the ceremony took plane, j
The weather was fine and the scene was I
brilliant.
After the administration of the oath,
the Emperor, who w i on horseback, ad- |
dressed the recruits, saying:
"You have now sworn an allegiance im
plying obedience and fidelity until death.
This oath applies to me, your chief and
your war lord, and Is sacred, as it is sworn
to God upon the crucifix. My house is a
Christian house and is nothing without
Christ, our Lord. Thus a soldier is noth
ing without faith. With a firm belief in
Christ, you have a special advantage.
"As long as|yon wear the King's coat,
remember that he who insults the Kine
insults your uniform as well as your chief.
Therefore, 1 trust that you will energeti
cally defend ihe King and crown, espe
cially in these times when disobedience
and discontent are rampant and disloy
ahy is rife. I rely upon you to always re
member your oath. It is easy for you to
dx> your duty while the eye of your su-
I erior is upon you, but it may be difficult
when you are alone, unobserved and ex
posed to the temptation of seducers. "Xet,
remember your vows. If you do your duty
fully, you will have the strongest claims
upon your country's gratitude.
"1 hope next year you will be present to
celebrate the hundredth anniversary of
the birth of the great Kaiser, William I.
His eyes are upon you. What he gained
we will protect with our last drop of blood.
I am confident that you will Lehave so as
not to be fouad wanting at the great re
view in heaven."
A loan for a KaiUcay.
PEKING, China, Nov. 12.â 1t is stated
that the Government will borrow from
Chinese capitalists the sum of 20,000,000
taels for the construction of the Hankow-
Peking Railway. It was 6tated a short
time ago that an American syndicate
would advance tnels for the
building of this line, but it is now rumored
that there is a hitch in the negotiations.
Prince Bismarck D'fiant.
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 12.â Prince
Bismarck is continuing his attacks upon
the administration of his successor, Count
Caprivi. through the columns of his organ,
the Hamburger Nachrichteu, which pub
lished to-day another article on the Kusso-
German treaty of neutrality. The ex-
Chaneelior is not in favor of the proposed
I debate on the treaty in the Reichstag, but
thinks it would beamatterof special in
terest to know why Caprivi in 1800 felt
compelled to cut the wires which still
united Germany to Russia. The ex-Chan
cellor is of the opinion that the question
of paramount importance to all Germany
now is whether a powerful neighbor like
Russia is in closer touch with Germany or
| with her opponents In Europe.
MANY REFORMS IN TURKEY.
Under a Pressure of the Powers the
Sultan Yields to the Demands for
Humanity.
LONDON, Exg., Nov. 12.â The Morning
Post will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Constantinople saying it is widely
affirmed that the Sultan intends to pro
mulgate the constitution of 1876, with a
view to placating the Mohammedan fac
tions, thus enabling him to confront the
possible combined pressure of the powers.
The Graphic's correspondent says a dis
patch received in that city from Constan
tinople remarks upon the surprise oc
casioned among the diplomats by the de
parture on leave of absence of M. Nclidoff,
the Russian Embassador, who has gone to
St. Petersburg, and Baron yon Calice, the
Austrian Embassador, who has gone to
Cairo. Signor Pansa, the Italian Embas
sador, is going to Italy, and Sir Philip
Currie, thd British Embassador, to Brusa.
It is stated that M. Cabon, the French Em
bassador, is going away from the city with
a Turkish party.
PARIS," France, Nov. 12.â M. Hano
taux, Minister of Foreign Affairs, in
formed the Cabinet this morning that the
Turkish Embassador, Z ; a Pasha, had
communicated with the Foreign Office in
writing confirming the reports that the
reforms which the Sultan had promised
were being carried out, telegrams having
already been sent by the Porte to the
military Governors informing them that
they would be held answerable for any
further bloodshed and instructing them to
immediately put into operation the re
forms agreed upon in J895. In addition
to this the Embasssdor, M. Hanotaux
said, bad informed him that the police of
Constantinople would be reorganized.
M. Hanotaux added that the European
Cabinets would now secure other re-'orms
in Turkey, including reforms in the ad
ministration of che finances.
NOT TO BE REMOVED.
Arehbiihop Ireland Said to Be in Dis-
yractat the Vatican.
ROME, Italy, Nov. 12.â There is rea
son to believe, that the rumors of the re
moval of Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul,
Minn., are unfoundeJ, although the Arch
bishop has fallen into disgrace at tho Vati
can. The case of the deposition of an
Aicbbishop or Bishop is one of extreme
rarity, only one of the kind having oc
curred during the eighteen years of the
papacy of Leo XIII, and in this instance
only when thÂ«s prelate had become almost
a maniac. The Vatican has received the
proposal of three names for the rectorship
ot the Catholic University at Washington
to succeed Bishop Keane. All of the can
didates are judged to be worthy of the
position and the choice will consequently
be difficult.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
MAY BE ANNEXED
Indications Are That There
Will Be a Renewal of
the Movement.
It May Be Commenced Soon Alter
the Accession of the New
Administration.
HARRISON'3 HELP PXPECTED.
The 0 d Treaty Remains in the Arch
ives and Is None the Worse
lor Wear.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 12.â The
Baltimore Sun says: The indications are
ihut there will be a renewal of the move
ment for the annexation of the Hawaiian
Islands immediately on t.;e accession of
the new administration.
Mr. McKinley was not in the House of
Representatives at "the time President
Harrison sent in the treaty of annexation
to the Senate. His views on the sub
ject were not made public, consequently.
President Harrison regarded it as a party
measure and one that would redound to
party interests. He would have been
most happy had it been possible to get the
treaty throueh the Senate in the lew re
maining weeks of his administration. It
is confidently wiiispered that his influence
will be secured for tlie revival of the ne
gotiations. He could claim it as the work
of his administration and revel in what
ever glory accrued from it. The same in"
dividuals who signed the former treat*
are still in control of the government of
of the islands and are ready to sign again
at the slightest encouragement from Wash
ington.
Possibly it might be assumed that no
necessity exists for the making of a new
treaty. It is not a new thing in the his
tory of diplomacy lor treaties to wait for
years before being finally ratified. The
Harrison treaty is in the archives of the
State Department, not worse for wear by
reason of its four years' burial. There
would be no difficulty in fishing it out and
trying its fortunes once more.
Quite a sprinkling of Democratic Sena
tors were in favor of the scheme and would
have voted that way had the opportunity
been offered. A number of those will ba
in the next Congress and it is said have
not changed their minds.
From all the developments and signs of
the Hawaiian project it is sure that large
pecuniary interests are dependent upon It,
and have all along had more to do with it
than any abstract considerations of fame
and glory to come from the acquisition of
territory.
SCOTT VISITS McKINLEY
national Committertnan Talks to Pre*i~
dent- Elect About Ihe Camrtaxfjn.
CANTON. Ohio, Not, 12â National
Committeeman N. B. Scott of West Vir
ginia, who was in the New York head
quarters during the campaign, arrived in
Canton this afternoon and had a long talk
with Major McKinley. Mr. Scott told the
President-elect a good deal of details about
the campaign conducted by the National
Committee in certain Southern States, and
expressed the belief that there were more
Republican than Democratic ballots cast
on November 3 in both Virginia and
Tennessee. Mr. Scott said he was heartily
in favor of establishing permanent head
quarters and believed the campaign of
education to be effective should be con
tinuous.
Mr.. Scott is highly pleased with the re
sult of the election in WWestW T est Virginia, and
is of the opinion that his State may hence
forth be counted among those classed as
safely Republican.
Major McKinley received a great many
visitors to-day and took a long drive this
afternoon. Mrs. McKinley was not well
enough to accompany him. The Presi
dent-elect had his picture taken to-day
with the committee which looked after
the entertainment of the 2000 ex-Con
federate veterans from the valley of the
Sbenandoah, who visited him before the
election.
Among the letters of congratulation ra
ceived to-day was the following:
Ex-Governor James E. Campbell, Hamil
ton, Ohio : "Inasmuch as Chairman Jones
gives it up this morning, I presume a
Democrat may now present his most
cordial congratulations without fear
of party discipline. Both Mrs. Campbell
and myself join your many personal
friends in wishing you a happy sojourn in
the White House and long life and pros
perity thereafter."
Joseph W. Babcock, Chairman Con
gressional Committee, Washington, D. C. :
"I have the Congressional campaign
wound ur>, the bills all paid and a little
balance left in the hands of the treasurer.
We have elected 201 sound-money Repub

SENATOR SHERMAN`S VIEWS.
Cannot Wake Any Predictions at to
lUcKinley's Foreign Policy.
NEW YORK, N. V. f Nov. 12.â Senator
John Sherman of Ohio, who is stopping
at the Fifth-avenue Hotel, had a number
of callers to-day. He ate breakfast with
John G. Carlisle, Secretary of the Treas
ury. In answer to a query by a reporter
of the United Associated Presses as to the
probability of the next administration
negotiating a new treaty of annexation
with Hawaii the Senator said:
*'I think Mr. McKinley will make a
wi3e, patriotic President, but as to his
foreign policy I cannot undertake to make
any predictions. I have not seen him for
several months. We must leave it to the
administiatfon to plan its own foreign
policy."
Mr. Sherman refused to express an
opinion on the matter. Asked if there
was any significance in the report of Gen
eral Miles recommending an increase of2
the army, me Senator replied that be had
not seen the report; **but." he added, "it
will require very weighty arguments to
convince Congress that there is any need
to increase the army. It is the settled
policy of this Nation to maintain but Â»
small standing array.' 1
In speaking of the reports from Wash
ington about possible hostilities with
Spain Senator Sherman said: "I do not
look for any trouble with Spain. Mr.
Cleveland seems to be following the right
policy â that of maintaining neutrality
with all the friendly powers."

KENTUCKY`S VOINC COUNTED
Twelve Republican and One Democratic
Elector Chosen.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. 12.â The offi
cial returns of the vote in each county for
â¦he election of November 3 are all in, and
with the counties of Marshall, McLean and
Montgomery left.off the table prepared by
the Secretary of State because of unex
p:ained irreguiaritiea, they show that W.
B. Smith, the first Democratic elector,
will have a vote in the Electoral College.
The other twelve electors will be Repub
licans (with the counties of Marshall, Mc-
Lean and Montgomery left out). S. H.
Kash, the first Republican elector, re
ceived 215,086 votes; Smith, the first Dem
ocratic elector, 212.89J; Trimbie, the last
Republican elector, 212,389, and Ward, the
first National Democratic elector, 5018.
Smith's plurality over the hindmost Re
publican elector may be wiped out alto
gether by the official count, and it cannot
be said fur certain yet that Trimble is that
man.
The official vote of the Seventh Con
gressional District shows that Settle de
feated Cblouel BreckmriJge by 1808 votes.
The total of the unofficial vote of Mc-
Lean, Marshall and Montgomery coun

figures make McKiniey's plurality in the
State 257. The returning board will meet
in a few days and announce the ofiicial
result.

President Harrison will not be a member
of McKinley's Cabinet. Mr. Miller says
that General Harrison has retired from

ECHOES OF THE WHISKY TRUST.
Judge Showalter Decides That the Con
tracts Given to Customers for Rebates
Are Binding.
CHICAGO, 111. Nov. 12.â Judge Sho
valter of the Uni:eii States Circuit Court
to-day gave an extended opinion in the
old whisky trust rebate case which was
passed upon some time aco by Special
Master Patton adversely to the holders of
rebate vouchers which had been issued by
the trust and the conditions of which had
bt-en broken by the original hollers.
Mom Solomon had bought a lot of this
questionable paper and sought to recover
its face value. About $400,000 of similar
claims have been presented in the Federal
court.
Judge Showalter holds that Master
Pattou was right in disallowing the
Ciaims; that the rebate vouchers con
stituted contracts; that the conditions as
to the holders beinc entitled to a rebate of
7 cents a gallon if they purchased their
requirements of the trust exclusively for
fejx consecutive months were not illegal,
and that the holders who have broken the
conditions cannot recover. Directly this
ruling affects the American Spirits Manu
facturing Compauy, but indirectly it up
holds the same trade regulations of such
corporations as the sugar trust, the spool
cotton combination and the Arbuckle
Bros. Company.
Substantially, all the claims against the
old whisky trust are now wiped out ex
cepting a few unimportant ones which are
pending on some of tbe leases which
the trust contracted. Under direction of
Judge Bhowalter Receiver McNulta re
jected these leases. A test case on the
alleged hens was decided against tbe
claimant, and it is now before the General
Court of Appeals, and representatives of
other corporations are said to be sbarincr
in the defense.

LOUISVILLE HTJRLS DEFIANCE.
Stuckey's Stars in a Position to
Demand Concessions as a
Peace-Offering.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 12.â As on yes
terday the corridors of tbe Auditorium
Hotel were thronged this morning with
baseball men of high and low degree, and
gossip of the diamond predominated.
The uppermost topic of the morning wi.s
the tie votÂ« by which John T. Brush, the
Indianapolis and Cincinnati magnate, was
temporarily " thrown down " in the mat
ter of approving the minutes of the first
meeting of tbe leacue.
The point at issue was whether the ac
tion of the National Board in delegating
itself the power of amending the National
agreement by a unanimous vote, in in
creasing its membership from lour to five,
including President "Nick" Young, ex
officio member, should stand. An amend
ment found at the end of the National
agreement reads: "This agreement may
be altered or considered at any time by
the unanimous consent of the board. This
amendment shall become operative after
February 11, 1396."
Such a clause practically gives unlimited
control to the board. The minutes as read
yesterday indicated that the league has
approved of the action of the board in in
serting the amendment and further rati
fied the increase of membership from four
to five.
Immediately there was a question as to
the correctness of the minutes. President
Brush and one or two others asserted they
remembered the approval of tne amend
ment in question at the league meeting.
Several did not know and the rest were
positive no such action had been taken,
boldly announcing they would have op
posed it at the time if it had been under
consideration. The pet plan, generally
credited to Mr. Brush, was thus to give
the whole power to the board rather than
to the league itself. There is also a clause
in the league constitution which provides
amendments to the national agreement
shall be adopted only by the unanimous
vote of tbe league. The two clauses were t
thereiore, in direct contradiction to each
other, but the league virtually waived its
right in favor of the board, if the minutes
were granted to be correct.
Both sides lobbied all the morning over
the board wrangle, and neither would ad
mit defeat.
The National League at 2 o'clock had
become split into two factions, which held
meetings far apart in the hotel and be
hind ciosed door?. The one under the
leadership of Dr. Stuckey of Louisville
went to a room on the top floor and the
big five remained in the regular meeting
place on the parlor floor. At tbat time
the situation was chaotic, with Louisville
holding the coveted balance of power and
Stuckey making all kinds of demands for
crack players. The fixed demand of
Louisvil"e was for Hallman of Philadel
phia, Catcher Clements and Right-fielder
Sam Thompson, in exchange for "Chick"
Frazer and McCreary.
The deal for this trade was started yes
terday, but the arbitration board wrangle
complicated matters.
At 4 o'clock the factions came together
and the report which obtained most
credence was tnat Stuckey had been won
over to support his old colleagues by a
liberal transfer of players. Dr. Btuckey
said before the meeting of each faction at
2 o'clock: "1 want something, the Louis
ville club wants -omethint;, and for once
tpe despised Louisville club is in a posi
tion to dictate. There must be conces
sions from both sides, no matter how I
act. If I remain with the smaller faction
tne tie vote will not be changed and Louis
ville will be in line for representation on
the National Board of Arbitration. For
year." we have been mulcted, and I firmly
believe we have been squeezed with the
intention of getting rid of us. We will
demand tne strengthening of our team.
I am for Mr. Byrne of Brooklyn, for the
board of arbitration. He has stood by
Louisville when we sorely needed help
and 1 never go back on a man who stands
by me. I don't care anything about the
Brush feature of the case. Personally 1
think the men connected in a minor
league franchise should be members of
the National board."
The report wns circulated in the hotel
rotunda that Andrew Freedman of New
York bad offered certain members of his
New York team as a peace offering to Dr.
Stuckey for the vote of Louisville. Bill
Clark, ConnauÂ«?hto:i and Stafford were
the players mentioned.
John T. Brush o? Cincinnati won the
factional fight in the National Baseball
League when tbe climax was reached at
the late afternoon session. Dr. Stuckey of
Louisville became his permanent ally and
the faction which has formerly been un
successfully opposed to the "big five"
minorityâ Boston. Chicago, Philadelphia,
New York and Pittsburgâ became the
"big seven" in the American National
game.
The coup was recorded during the meet
ing, which began at 4 o'clock and ended at
7:30. A motion was put to reconsider the
adoption of the miuutes of the previous
met- tin.'. This was carried by a vote of 7
to 5, and the minority realized that Mr.
Brush had outplayed them in league poli
tics. Dr. Stuckey voted with the six on
the adoption of the minutes, which leaves
the National board of arbitration practi
cally with no authority over the National
League except in minor league matters.
The officers of the National Board were
then elected and the membership remains
at four, President Young not having the
right to vote. This question of member
ship and authority of the board will be
brought belore the spring meeting of tbe
league by the five club combination and
another lively tussle it promised. Brush,
Kobison, Byrne and otherÃof the major
ity were chatty and smiling over the sit
uation, while Freedman, Soden, Hart and
their coiieagaes were glum and reticent
aiter ibe meeting.
The following board of directors was
elected: Messrs. Freedman, New York-
Soden, Boston; Warner, Washington ;
Kobison. Cleveland; Yon der Abe. St.
Louis; Stuckey, Louisville. In voting for
the arbitration board the combination of
seven clubs held together against the five,
and that ended the struggle for the
present.
It developed to-day that Vice-President
Lehler of the Louisville Club, and not Dr
Stuckey, voted at yesterday's meeting in
BtucJcey's absence with the "big live"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1896.
when the amendment to the National
agreement came up. This made the tie
vote, and necessitated hara laboring with
Stuckey on Byrne's part to-day. This de
layed the meeting six hours.
Sunday bail, it is said on reliable au
thority, was used as a club to drive
Stuckey into the Brush camp. Brush,
Robison and others said they would not
play Sundays in Louisville, or make Sun
day dates with Louisville in their sched
ules. Soden of Boston said he did
not believe anything except arguments
had been used on Stuckey to win him
over. Freedman said he bad either been
wheedled or coerced.
The league will meet again to-morrow
morning.
The Western League.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 12.â T0-day's ses
sion of the Western League was called for
11 o'clock, but the magnates evinced no
disposition t6 hurry and it was noon be
fore President Johnson rapped his associ
ates to order and the league got down to
business. The first thing done was to de
cide that Columbus and Grand Rupids
should remain in the league for another
season. There were applications from
Dcs Moines and Toledo, but as no opposi
tion developed to a renewal of the Colum
bus and Grand Rapids franchises there
was no chance for the other cities, which
were accordingly ignored.
Rusie Sues far a Release.
CHICAGO. IltÂ», Nov. 12.â Failing to
secure his release from the New York
Baseball Clubat the hands of the National
League, Amos Rusie, the Indianapolis
player, filed a bill for an injunction in* the
Federal court this morning in order to
secure his release by lecal process. Inci
dentally Rusie's application to the court
means more than his personal release if
granted. It means that the right of reser
vation exercised by the baseball clubs has
no legal standing, and makes an open field
at the close of each season for the con
tracting of players for the following rea
son. In addition Rusie began a suit at
law for the recovery of $5000 damages by
reason of the conduct of the New York
club in depriving him from following his
profession.

MORTON DENIES THE REPORT

States Department of Agriculture attrib
uted the languishing condition of the hop
market to the neneral use of chemicals as
substitutes for hops in brewing.
The United States Brewers' Association,
in a letter to Secretary Morton, protested
against this assertion, denounced it as ab
solutely false and offered to assist in the
prosecution of any person guilty of adul
teration. In reply the association received
the following from Secretary Morton:

Company applied to Judge Grosscup this
afternoon for an icjnncrion against the
Metal Polishers' National Union restrain
ing that organization and its officers from

SOCIETY AT THE
BIG HORSE SHOW
Large and Swell Gathering
at the Madison Square
Gardens.
Drill of the Municipal Mounted
Police a Mcst Pieasant
Feature.
DIVIDED SKIRTS AEE BARRED.
Again the Cashing Variety Actress
Is Denied the Privilege of
the Ring.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 12â Jnpiter
Pluvius and his attendant ministers of
rain and slush have no terrors for the
fashionable throng who for a week every
year vie with each other in the display of
pomp and beauty and incidentally pat
ronize that noble animal the horse. Con
sequently the attendance this afternoon
at M^dison-squure Garden was the best
-ince the show began, numbering 5500
people.
At night too the constant stream that
poured in and distributed itself through
the boxes and reserved seats, leaving the
overflow to join the eddying circle on the
floor, seemed, never-ending. Those who
came to see the horses â always a heroic
minority â were ranged six deep around
the lanbark railing wnere they stood,
criticizing form in a learned manner.
Those who came "to see and be seen" â
the great majorityâ paraded in such num
bers that the "mating of the grand cir
cuit" on the floor was a feat only to be
accomplisned at a slow pace and at an
utter disregard of time, and occasionally
attended with a decided wrinkling of
voluminous sleeves and diminished pa
tience.
In the tan barked arena, three or four
accidents, happily of a minor nature, oc
curred at regular intervals throughout the
day.
The drill of municipal mounted police
under the command of Acting Inspector
McCullagh, lent a military air to the
evening performance which was highly
appreciated. The troop as usual presented
a splendid appearance, and obeyed the
commands of their leader like veteran
cavalrymen. They went through all
evolutions with a perfection of discipline
that provoked a storm of applause at the
conclusion of every movement.
The irrepressible variety actress who
was turned down yesterday was aeain on
hand to-day. She had substituted divided
skirts for the objectionable pink tights of
last evening, bat her white stallion was
again equipped with a man's saddle, and
accordingly the ring committee refused to
allow her to ride astride. This was her
last appearance, as she oniy entered in
two classes, and after threatening dire
penalties, she departed muck to the relief
of the directors.
Sixteen classes in all were judged to-day,
and among the most interesting was the
fine display of Shetlands. The tandem
class also came in for a lot of well-merited
applause, while the jumping classes, es
pecially :he green Hunters, brought out
some good performers.
Hackneys and trotting stallions took up
the time of the judges until recess.
Fred C. S'.evens won first and second in
the claÂ«s for hackney mares, three-year
olds, of any height. A clasl for half-bred
hackneys required the judges to decide
between Hamlin's Almont Jr., a trotting
stallion, with four of his get by hackney
mares, and A. J. Cassatt's hackney stallion
Cadet with fonr youngsters by unregis
tered mares. There was applause when
the trim-built trotter-bred stock were
given the ribbon, although they showed
less of the hackney characteristics than
Cadet's offspring.
Bancroft, owned by S. H. Hunse, was
the first in the competition for two-year
old stallion trotters and in the class for
trotters, rillies, two to four years, shown in
harness, Minneola King, entered by C. J.

MANTODERS STILL LIVING.
Proof of the Existence of Huge Animal â¢
in Alaska.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 12.-A special
from St. Paul says: Copies of the Alaska
News of Juntau received say: In conver
sation with a gentleman formerly of Den
ver, who came out this fall with a party ol
miners, we learned that the existence of
living mastodons near the headwater* Â«f
the White River was not the mere fabrica
tion of the Northern furriery but that the
Stick Indians had told him thut not later
than five years ago such animals had been
seen by them.
One of the Indians said that while hunt
ing one day in the unknown section he
came across an immense track, sunk to a
depth of several inches in the moss. In
the description as the Indian marked out
to him in the sand it much resembled an
elepnant s track, and was larger around
than a barrel. Upon striking it the Indian
iOUowed up this curious trail, which to all
appearances was very fresh, and tracking
irom one immense stride to the other for
a distance of some miles, he came in full
view of his game.
The huÂ»ter gave one look and then
turned and fied as thouch pursued by the
evil one. He described it as being larger
than Harper's (the post trader's) store,
with great shining yellowish tusks and a
mouth large enough to swallow him at a
single eulp. He said the animal was
undoubtedly the same as Were the huge
bones scattered over that section. If such
an animal is now in existence, and there
is no reason to doubt the veracity of the
Indian, as other Indians, and also Harper,
had confirmed it, they inhabit a section of
very high altitude and one but rarely vis
ited by unman beings, and those only In
dians. We have also no reason to doubt
the Indian's tale, for at no very distant
period the Yukon country was i"n habited
by these animals, and hundreds of their
massive ateletons found strewn along the
creeks are the silent but truthful wit
nesses.
IN TWO SEPARATE GRAVES.
Discovery of the Remains of a Murdered
Woman That Had Been Cut in
Two Before Interment.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Nov. 12.â The body
of an unknown young woman was found
buried yesterday in a fiela near the city.
It had been cut in two at ttie waist and
carried to the field in gunny sacks, where
two separate graves were made, the head
and trunk placed in one and the lower part
of the boay in another.
There were some peculiar features about
the affair. The burial-place was near the
insane asylum, and the employes there
saw two men ride into the field Tuesday
night on horseback. They dismounted
and opened the grave with a spade. After
looking at tbe face of the corpse they rode
away, leaving the grave uncovered.
Tbe employes of the asylum aid not at
the time realize what was going on and
paid little attention to the actions of the
men. Yesterday, however, they went out
to where the men had been seen and found
the body.
No one has yet identified the body, and
it is believed to have been brought from
some other place. That a murder has
been committed there is little doubt, and
an investigation is being made by the Cor
oner and police. The body had been buried
for some time, probably for several weeks,
and was considerably decomposed. There
was no clothing or marks of identification
upon it.
FOUGHT IN A SALOON
Striking Miners and Austrian
Smslters Engage in a Fu
rious tattle.
During the Clashing of Knives One
Man Was Killed and F&ur Others
Badly Wounded.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Nov. 12.â Striking
miners and a party of Austrians clashed
in a saloon here at an early hour this
morning. One man was killed and four
badly cut, one of them fatally.
The dead man is Stepl.en Frar.kowitz.
It is thought Jerry Dormandy will die of
injuries received. The others injured are:
Joseph Austermao, John Jackson and an
unknown man.
Abont twenty men took part in the
fight. A party of Austrians employed in
the smelters was followed inio the saloon
by a crowd of striker?. The strikers called
the Austrians scabs, and this they re
sented.
Knives were drawn, and a fierce fight
waged until the police put in 4 an ap
pearance. Afl those concerned managed
to make their escape with the exception
of the injured. The Austrians are union
smelting men, but were mistaken by the
strikers for non-union men.

LABOR'S KNIGHTS
ARE VERY BUSY
Many Matters of Interest
Before the General
Assembly.
District Assemblies to Be Given
a Large Measure of Home
Rule Power.
AN INCOME TAX IS URGED.
But Resolutions Relating to tho Money
Question Are Apparently
Not Welcome.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Nov. 12.â There
are numerous resolutions of Importance
still in the hands of the Knights of Labor
committee which have not as yet been of
fered to the General Assembly. The re
port of the executive committee has been
made public. It details the oart taken by
the Knights of Labor in the Populist and
Democratic National conventions in an at
tempt to unite the two parties for the
principles urs;ed by the Knights, and re
joices at the' prominence given the issues
there enumerated.
Alter the reading of the minutes by Sec
retary Hayes a resolution was offered that
the election of officers be taken up at 3
o'clock this afternoon, but it was defeated.
It is said thai General Mater Workman
Sovereign will be re-elected.
A resolution was adopted instructing
the secretary to telegraph fraternal greet
ings to the session of the Supreme Coun
cil of the Farmers' Alliance in progress at
Indianapolis.
The committee reported favorably on
the adoption of the following amendment
to section 2of tbe constitution proposed
by District Assembly Seventy-live of
Brooklyn, composed of street and elevated
railroad men:
"Provincial, State, National, trade and
district assemblies are sovereign in their
own jurisdiction, under the general laws
of the order and are empowered to decide
all disputes arising within their jurisdic
tion, subject to appeal to the General
Assembly."
The amendment is proposed so as to
give the district assemblies a large meas
ure of home-rule power. Under the sec
tion as it now stands appeals are made to
the general executive board.
Discussion of the proposed amendment
occupied tbe morning session, but no ac
tion was taken. There is much senti
ment in favor of the amendment, but it is
thought that much time will be taken up
in discussing it.
Tne afternoon session began early and
lasted until 4 o'clock. The time was taken
up with the discussion of different reso
lutions which were presented to the as
sembly by the Law Commission. None of
them were passed. The report of the
general worthy foreman, M. J. Bishop,
was submitted.
Among the papers presented to the dis
tribution committee last night was a reso
lution indorsing a graduated income tax,
which would apply to all incomes and be
laid with a per cent that should increase
as the amount of tbe income increased.
Tiie committee on laws took the ques
tion up, and there was a hot discussion, as
it was felt that it was a radical step for
the organization to take, but it was finally
indorsed and presented to the General
Assembly this morning and adopted.
The Knights will do all in their power to
have such a tax enacted by Congress, and
failing there wi'.l use their influence to
have the tax incorporated in the platform
of one of the great political parties.
Resolutions have been offered opposing
the issue ol National bank notes, and de
claring that all money should be issued
exclusively by the National Government,
and taking a definite stand in regard to
the many matters from which the Knights
have stood aloof. It is not known whether
they will indorse free silver or not.
The principal opponent to Mr. Sov
ereign for general master worxman is T.
G. AlcGuire of Armstrrdam, a member of
the executive board. Mr. Sovereign is
strong with the Western and Southern
delegates, while McGuire is strong in New
York and New England.
DESERVES NO ATTENTION.
Gomperm Aot Anxtou* to Enter Into a
Controvert^ ttith'fiovereian.
INDiANAPGLIS, Ind., Nov. 12.âPresi
dent Oomperaof the Federation of Labor
was asked by a United Associated Presses
reporter this afternoon for an expression
as to the reference made by Master Work
man Sovereign of the Knights of Labor,
in his annnal address before the conven
tion of that body now in session at Roches
ter. He replied: "Well, I hardly think
he is deserving of any attention. No one
pays any attention to what he says. No
one has ever paid any attention to his
statements â not even when he ordered
laboring men to lay down their tools in
1894 was any heed given to his words.
His reference to the Federation has no
effect whatever, and inasmuch as there are
practically no members of his organization
left we have no worry over what he says."

TO THE FARMERS
Interesting Address Made

. . POLITICS ALSO TOUCHED UPON.
'Policy of Arraying Class Against
Class Not the Way to Insure
Prosperity.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ixd., Nov. 12.â The
third day's session of the Farmers' Na
tional i on gress had two important feat
ures. One was an address by General
Harrison and the other was the adoption
of a memorial to Congress.
General Harrison was in a very happy
mood and when he aroÂ«e 10 speak he was
greeted enthusiastically. In part he said:
"1 came here to make an acknowledg
ment of the compliment you have shown
rae by Inviting me to appear before this
congress. 1 suppose that politics is barred,
as this is an agricultural meeting. I'm
not an agriculturist, though born and
reared on a farm. My education was paid
lor by the proceeds of corn and hogs. It
is a custom of the time for men of a par
ticular occupation to associate themseives
to ether to develop and cultivate mutual
interests, buch organizations are to be
encouraged, but we must not forget that
lawyers, .'armers and laborers all have in
terests and that no one class should try to
get the better of the other classes. We are
all rejoicing that you are gettine a little
more for wheat and corn, though it is at
the expense of us who have to pay a little
more for the things we consume."
â¢ Then the general ventured a little piece
out into political waters.
"I have no patience with those people
who are always lighting the air," he said.
He advised men who believed that legis
lation is prejudicial to tneni ;o go about
a fipht in a systematic way, not "righting
the air." It was plain that the general was
referring to a situation in the present cam
paign. He advised that public sentiment
be focused on whatever question of un
usual import was brought before the peo
ple, and that men go straight after what
they want.
Then he told of how a brakeman came
and sat down beside him in the train one
day recently and told him that he did not
like the idea of this thing of trying to
array class against class. This rersark of
the brakeman of course pleased General
Harrison.
"Whatever they say about class in this
country, the creat body of the American
people will work for truth and right.
When any men engaged In a particular
calling from high motives associate them
selves together, and pursue those high
motives in their association, only good
can result. But we should not be selfish
in our purposes. I think I may say that
if we were absolutely selfish in our pur
poses and thought only oi our own good,
the good of the class and of the individnal
of the class, we should find that good most
highly promoted by taking a broad view
of things and by admitting to our delib
erations the thought that it is not possible
for one class to be highly prosperous while
al! o 'her classes are suffering; that there
is an interdependence in all our business
and social relations, ;ind that this is highly
developed in a free government like ours.
"In other words, in a broad sense, we
prosper together and we suffer together;
we are interdependent. I think some
times the conceit of the farmer has been
unduly promoted when it is said that he
is at the bottom of everything and that he
belongs to an independent class tnat
cities are not of much account and thnt
farms are God' 3 work and er.during. What
would the farm be witnout the town and
what would the town be without the farm ?
These cities furnish the population that
consumes the products of the farm and
the farm furnishes the subsistence of the
city. I heard a friend say the other day
'It is the city for the country and thÂ«Â»
country for the city and all for the flag.'
If there are abuses of any kind of legisla
tion or in the business of the country let
us fix the pubiic eye upon them until we
have exposed tie evil and then we can
trust the country to make it right.
"It is mischievous to denounce classes,
and this thing and that. It th^re are
trusts let us know it, and bring legislation
to bear upon them and court decrees to
bear upon them, and then we iiave accom
plished something. If any man will make
it plain to the American people that he is
oppressed, that he is not getting his j
rights, then I undertake to say that the !
American people will be on his vide, |
egaiust whatever may oppress him. j
Idy thought is, if you think there
are wrongs and grievances in the
business condition or in legislation
hi:nt them out and specify them, hoid
them up to the public judgment and have
faith in your fellow-man. For 1 say to
â¢you that of the great body of the people, j
an overwhelming majority, are in favor
always <->f justice and fairness, and if you
make ihat appeal to them ihey will re
spond.
â¢â¢I have rejoiced in all that has tended
to make agriculture easier, to give leisure
lor thought and reading, for the cultiva
tion nf the intellect. I rejoice that the
frchoolhouse and the litfM church are
found in every country neighborhood. I
r< j Â»:ce i" the belief that our people are
patriotic and that never before in the his
to-y of our country whs there a deeper and
more universal love of ttie starry banner
and the constitution for which it stands."
A memorial to Congress, prepared by a
special committee, was read and adopted 1
at the morning session. After the memo
rial was read, C. M. Hose of Ohio moved j
that the paragraph asking that the duty
upon wool, as< prayed for by the National
Wool-jrrowers' Association one year a-o
and embodied in the memorial, he stricken
out nr.d cls<o that the time of holding im- !
ported wool in bond be extended tnirty
days.
The motion brought a wrathful reply
from Judge Lawrence of Ohio, who
charged that Hogg's interests were with,
the manufacturers rather than with the
wool-growers. He charged that t'.je Ding
ley bill discriminated in favor of the
manufacturer nnd against the woo!- j
grower. Mr. Hogg, in ropiying, said that j
95 percent of the manulactur rs were in |
'ynipathy with the American wool- j
growers, and the discrimination against
American wools is because of the faulty
condition in which they are put upon the
market.
The memorial asks Congress to see to it
that no trusts are organized ttint can ex
tort exorbitant prices for farm products,
favors the protective tariff }Â«>licy and
â¢sks, regarding wool, theso changes iv the j
Dingley bill: That the "skirtine" cl ausc
of tiie act of 1890 shall not be applicable to
the bill; that the pledge therein that it
shall continue in operation "until
August 1, 1898," shall be struck out; that
the duties on woolen rags, suoridy,
tnungo, flocks, nocks, wastes and other
adulterants >liall be made prohibitory;
that wool and woolen manufactures im
ported under its provisions shall not re
main in bonded warehouses more than
ten days.
EPISCOPAL MISSIONARY WORK.
Some of the Appropriations Are Cut, but
the Scope of Foreign Labor Is
Net Changed.
DETROIT, Mint.. Nov. 12.âApportion
ment of the yearly appropriations occupied
tbe sessions of tne general missionary
committee of the Methodist Episcopal
Church to-day. Appropriation was made
providing for t;ie reduction of the salaries
of the officials of the committee, but after
a. long discussion an appropriation of $13,
-000 was made for salaries of secretaries and
missionary Bishops. This is an increase
of $4000 over last year, an additional
Bishop and secretary being provided for.
The appropriation for office expenses
was cut from $13 000 to $10,000. This left
a balance of $981,000 for missionary work,
and 45 per cent was appropriated for home
and 55 per cent ior foreign missions, the
same percentage as last year. A special
committee will prepare addresses to be
delivered before conferences and to be
widely disseminated for the purpose of
raising missionary funds.
Owing to the reduction of the general
appropriation fund it was found necessary
to make a cut of 4 per cent on the appor
tionment of last year for foreign missions.
In the Eastern Asia division China was
first taken up, and $J5,000 was appropriated
for Foochow missions, a cut of $1100;
$35,000 for Central China, a cut of $5000;
$40,000 for North China, a cut $1850, and
$12,500 lor West China, an increase of
$1700.
To-nieht there was a platform meeting
in the Central Ift E. Church at which Dr.
H. G. Jackson and Bishop H. W. Warren
delivered addresses on "Our Domestic
Missions."
STOPPED BY THE POLICE
Lucy Parsons Talks at the
Annual Demonstration ot
the Anarchists.
Those Who Executed the Newmarket
Prisoners Are Styled Hide
ous Murderers.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 12.â Trembling,
her cheeks red and her fists ciencned, Lucy
Parsons was led off the stage at the West
Twelfth-street Turner Hail by Police Cap
tain John Wheeler last night at the annual
demonstration in memory of the anar
chists who were executed as a result of thÂ«
Hay market murder.
Captain Wheeler and a number of mer
were on the platform as she began tc
speak. There wes rofhing out of the or
dinary in the first words of Mrs. Parsons.
Her son, she said, was like his father, and
she was teaching him to take up the grcal
struggle for which his father had laid down
his life and where his father bad left off.
She predicted tiiat the day would come,
although the feet of the executed men had
ceased to travel the earth, when a million
bodies would move 011 their legs, and that
then from the graves *in Waidheim the
social revolution would spring.
All the time Mrs. Parsons was getting
more vehement in her manner and more
pronounced in her utterances. Arriving
at a description of the manner in which
the four men went to the scaffold, she de
clared that the men who bad charge ol
the hanging hurried through with their
work because they feared to look four
honest men in the face.
Then came the climax. Raising her
voice to its highest pitch she said: "I
nsk you for w:.at they suffered! What
crime had they committej? 1 ask you,
hideous murderers, you gang of mur
derer?, from Gary, Grinnell and Governor
O^lesby down to the gang of hired police
spies â I ask" â
Here Captain Wheeler hastened across
the stage an>i, before Mrs. Parsons could
stay any more. led her from the scene.
Instantly the hall was in an uproar. Men
shouted and gesticulated wildly, and for
just a few seconds there was a more
toward the stage.
Chairman Apple gra?ped the situation,
and calied for order and it was partially
restored. In the meaniime Captain
Wheeler and Mrs. Parsons were exchang
ing courtesies in the wing?.
"What are you trying to do to me?"
demanded Mrs. Parsons, her eyes* fairly
glistening; "prevent me from telling the
people why yon murdered my husband?
Well, I will teli them."
Suiting the action to the word she has
tened to the stage and fairly shouted,
while she shook her clenched fist in the
direction oi the back part of the hall:
"You murderers! I hurl it in your
teeth."
Captain W T heeler was soon at her side,
and again led her away. Then the house
was thrown into another uproar, and some
one shouted "Forward!" The good judg
ment of the chairman was again exer
ctsed, and Johann Most, who in the mean
time had arrived, was introduced to gain
the attention of (he audience. After quier
had been restored Mrs. Parsons lefi the
stage and took her seat in the center of the
hail.
Oliver's speech was a defense of an
archism. He siid it was not the desire of
anarchists to iear down or destroy any
thing, but raiher to build up.
Herr Most was not very radical in his
remarks when he saw Mrs. Pursons was
interrupted. He simply cave a recapitu
lation of tho events from" the time the first
anarchist meeting was disbanded by the
police until the hanging of the four men
in 1887. In closing he said that anarchy
had not been kille 1 by the hanging of the
four men. "X0.n0," he continued, "an
archy is not dead, but it is getting stronger
each year, and wi;i live on forever."
AN EXPRESS-TRAIN WRECKED
One Car Thrown Down an Embankment
and Two of the Passengers
Badly Injured.
MONTGOMERY. Ala., Nov. 12.â The
fast mail on the Louisville and Nashville
Railroad for New Orleans, leaving here at
9:3) o'clock to-night, was wrecked when
four miles from town, but fortunately no
one was killed. The engine, mail, bag
gage, express, smoker and one sleeper left

fifty feet from the track, but landed right
side up and even the lights were not ex

WEAVING A WEB
AROUND MOORE
Many Witnesses Give Dam
aging Evidencs Against
the Prisoner.
Ghastly Details of the Aw ul
Crime Are Told and
Retold.
UNLUCKY WATCH ABD PI.TGL.
Moora and Schmidt Seen Together
Near Greenwood's Place the Day
of the Murder.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 12.â The Moore trial
was continued to-day before the Superior
Court.
Hugh Kelly as a witness for the prosecu
tion told how, while driving toward Napa
in the early morning of February 10, 1891,
he saw Captain Greenwood, bound and
bleeding, standing before the latter's gate.
Cutting tne bonds ne entered the house
with the captain and found Mrs. Green
wood lying upon the bed, cold and dead.
He drove to town for the Sheriff and a
doctor and when he returned other people
ua i gathered at the house.
Sheriff McKenzie described the appear
ance of the House, the position of Mrs.
Greenwood, the location of the blood
stains on the floor, bed and wall, and the
condition of the horse, buggy and harness
that had been used by the murders, and
other matter in detail. He identified the
cords with which Mr. and Mrs. Green
wood were tied, the gag that was used on
Mr. Greenwood, the broken pieces of har
ness found by Howard Franklin and him
self near Hathaways, where tue horse
driven by Koe and Schmidt had fallen,
the shoes ol tne murderer which were dis
covered by Mr. Kelly, and other exhibits
ol the prosecution.
Peter Lynch testified that he knew the
defendant; first saw him in September,
1889, when he hired him to work on the
Tormey & Fagan ranch. Defendant
worked for him at different periods from
that time until January 27, 1891 â some
times at the Tormey & Fagan plare and
sometimes at the Sheeny place. He also
testified that he to^k Roe's watch to Napa
on December 19, 1890, to be repaired by
H. L. Amstutz.
Dr. Haim was called again this morn
ing. His testimony was to the effect that
at the autopsy on the body of Mrs. J. Q.
Greenwood it was discovered that a gun
shot-wound had been inflicted, but that
it had not cansed death, as death had pre
viously occurred. If the bu:let had in
flicted death hemorrhage would have
occurred and clots would have been
formed. This would tend to prove that
Mrs. Greenwood's death was cansed by the
poison administered.
Dr. Pond corroborated the statement of
Dr. Jlann, and in addition raid that be
fore death had occurred Mrs. Greenwood
bad been severely strangled, as finger
marks were discovered about the throat.
George Knox was then placed on the
btand. He worked with Moore for several
months for Mr. Lynch and was well ac
quainted witn defendant. He said de
leiidant was the owner of a li;bt-colored
overcoat Rnd also of certain jewelry. The
most important part of his testimony was
that in reference to a bottle of chloro:orm,
which bottle was in Moore's possession.
Mrs. Greenwood was poisoned with chlo
roform, and the bottle used by the mur
derer was similar to that usedby Moore.
Witness also identified a pistol which
previous to the murder wns owned by
Moore, but which was found under a
I bridge after the crime had been commit-
I ted. On the evening of the 9th Moore
came to the German House looking for
Knox.
H. Meyer, a citizen of Cordelia, testified
to tbt> finding of a pistol under a railroad
t.ridj;e some months after the murder.
This was the pistol identinei by Knox as
belonging to Moore.
E. Hyatt, a constable of Cordelii, said
that Meyer bad turned the pistol over to
him and that he in turn had riven it into
the keening of Sheriff McKenzie.
Fred Stemle testified to seeing Moore
and Carl Schmidt together on February 8
in front of a saloon. Moore was walking
up and down on the platform and Stemla
passed into the saloon. He had a conver
sation with Schmidt, the result of which
was that he purchased a watch of Schmidt
for $4. As stemle passed ont Moore asked
him if he bought a watch of Schmidt. Re
ceiving an affirmative answer. Moore said
â¢'Well, that will do us." The watch was

CAIITO, Cal., Nov. 12.â The preliminary hearing of the prisoners arrested in the
Mudgett case began at 1 o'clock to-day at Usai. From the outset the evidence
against young Dodge showed him to be the master spirit of the conspirator*. The
hearing continued until after midnight, when an adjournment was taken. The case
will again be taken up to-morrow, wi en it is expected it will conclude by night. No
new arrests were made to-day. The town and vicinity was largely represented in
court, and there were many interested spectators to the proceedings. Interruption
to telephone communication Jo-night precludes the possibility of obtaining the de
tails of the nature of evidence and the proceedings in general to-night.

now on exhibition in the courtroom.
Lynch testified that he had taken a
waich belonging to Moore to H. L.
Amstutz for repairing on December <f 0

Mr. Amstutz positively stated that the
watch was repaired by him.
The remainder of the testimony today
was to prove that Moore was seen near
Mr. Greenwood's place on the day of the
murder.
Mary Holland and J: Shorer positively
i lentitied Moore as the man seen on that
day.
The case was then continued until to
morrow morning.
WHEAT PRICES ADVANCED.
There Is a marked Demand and Lively
Trading in the Chicago and New
York P.ts.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 12.â "Wheat to-day
opened active and with a steady to firm
tone at yesterday's decline.
About 10 o'clock, when prices had worked
their way up % cent from the opening
several lines of wheat came on the market,
depressing from 79% to 78>^. Late cables
were %d higher, their posting giving
buyers encouragement and causing a
sharp covering movement On this flurry
December rose to 79% cents, but almost
immediately dropped back to 79 cents.
By dint of hard work and steadfast buy
ing, local bulls succeeded in advancing
prices about 1% cents from the inside.
This improvement was during the last
hour. Lat^ Liverpool cable being unex
pectedly firm revived the courage* of
holders, who displayed less anxi ty to
sell. In the last fifteen minutes the buy
ing became sharp and decisive, prices ad
vancing % of a cent additional to the pre
vious gain. The local crowd was caught
shcrl and in the limited time allowed to
cover the market became excited.
New York displayed even greater
strength than Chicago and led the ad
vance right up to the close. The range
for December was between 78Â»4 and 80^
to 80% cents, and the close at 80% cents, \%
cents higher than yesterday.

Maggie May. a Race Mare With a
Record, Was Caught on a Bridge
as tho Train Approached.
CHESTER, Pa., Nov. 12. -The prompt
action of Charles Copock prevented in all
probability great loss of life and the de
railment of a northbound express train at
7:10 to-night on tlie Pennsylvania Rail
road.
He was walking across a long trestle
bridge that spans Chester Creek when he
met three horses running up the track.
He drove two of them back, but one of the
animals ran on the bridge and its legs be
came entangled in the ties and it could
not liberate itself.
The train from Wilmington was ap
proaching the dangerous point, but Co
pock succeeded In having it stopped a
short distance from the bridge. The
horses were all blooded stock and had
broken from a pasture at Claymount. The
struggling mare was Maggie May, with a
record of 2:30 and in foal and the other
animals werÂ« colts by Saladin, the famous
pacer. Travel was delayed for a long time
until the mare was extricated by means of
planks and ropes.

EXAMINERS MEET
AT SACRAMENTO
Coyote Claims Necsssitate
an Extra Session of
the Board.
The Enormous Bill Against the
State Makes the Governor
Skeptical.
GROSS FRAUDS ARE SUSPECTED.
Rigid Inv stigations to Be Made and
Affidavits R qu red in Ques
tionable Cases.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 12.â The
State Board of Examiners met in extra
session to-day for the purpose of consider
ing what action would be most advisable
to pursue in regar Ito coyote claims. In
speaking of the matter under considera
tion the Governor said:
"The claims from the counties which
are doubtful aggregate $110,000. I am in
favoi of setting out this amount to pay
such claims as are found to be legitimate
upon investigation, the remaining amount
to be paid back into the treasury, these
investigations to be made, say, before
county j udges,and each man to be required
to testify as to where his claim came
from. This would place frauds in a box.
Some of these affidavits have become out
lawed, that is, the three years within
which they may be prosecuted has elapsed.
I want to renew these oaths. We have got
evidence which will prevent thousands of
these Being renewed."
After considerable discussion it was de
cided that Secretary Markley bs instructed
to go over the claims and make a report of
the amount necessary to pay the entire
amount of the claims, money for fraudu
lent and doubtful claims to be withheld.
The Attorney-General will t 1 en draw up
a bill and submit it to the board for ap
proval, when it will be included in their
report.
A claim was put in for $100 reward un
der the Governor's offer uf reward tor ille
gal voting. The claim being made by A.
C. Vognes and the culprit being Henry
Rice, who 1 leaded guilty in Los Angeles.
The claim was allowed.
Secretary Markley spoke of the report of
the board. He saiu that claims that had
been passed upon by former boards were
constantly coming up, and he wanted to
know if these should again be put in the
reports. It was decided thai matters that
had been once passed upon should be
given no attention, but treated as disposed
of, just as judgments of courts.
Governor Budd stated that he wanted
to have the matter considered in regard to
salaries paid under the busine-ss of th*
Board ol Education. He thought that if
this hoard bad to pass upon claims, th y
should have power to regulate these sal
aries. He was in favor 01 asking the Leg
islature for such power.
The bonds of the Sin Francisco depot,
offered for the same by Rollins & Son,
were taken up. A discussion as to whether
they were "civil funded bonas," as de
scribed 111 the code, was entered into. At
torney-General Fitzgerald wanted time to
investigate. Governor Budd wanted to
know how the bonds were to be repaid.
He thought it possible that an effort
might be made to turn the property over
to the city of San Francisco, and establish
free dock*, etc. This would do away with
the revenue necessary to repay the bonds.
To bring the matter up, Secretary of
State Brown made a motion to buy the
bonds. The motion received no second.
The Controller, State Treasurer and Sec
retary Brown were delpgated to inves
tigate and make a report to the board, the
beard to act in accordance with the
opinion.

STOCKTON'S MISSING MAN.
Charles Grigsby's Relatives Anxious as to
His Fateâ Said to Have Com
mitted Suicide.
STOCKTON, Cal., Nov. 12.â Charles
Griesby, aged 32, leit Stockton November
8, 1895, with tbe express intention of going
to Mexico, whore he iiad been before. At
Los Angeles, September 9, he wrote a let
ter to his si3ter at Sanger. Nothing was
afterward heard from him and his wid
owed mo.her, Mary E. Sturgeon of this
city, has been anxious to learn something
of his whereabouts. Recently the brother
of the missing man was in Clements,
where the latter used to live, and was told
by a neighbor that he had seen an ac
count either in The Call or Chronicle
over a year ago of the suicide of Charles
Griirsby on a southbound train. This
neighbor expressed great surprise that the
relatives of Grigsby had not heard of it
before and made an investigation.
Coming from a man of known reliability
this statement, coupled with ihe silenca cf
the missing man, convinced the relatives
of its truth. The mother and sister pro
ceeded to San Francisco and examined
the files of one of the papers named with
out results. They are now searching the
other. Grigsby is suid to have, been de
spondent over a farming enterprise at
Clements, which was not profitable. His
mother believes he had several hundred

FOOTBALL AT PALO ALTO
Reliance Makes a Good Slow
ing in the Last Practice
Games.
All the Men in Fine Form and Hope*
lul of Defeating the
Olympics.
PALO ALTO, Cal., Nov. 12.â Stanford
played the last of the series of three prac
tice games with the Reliance eleven this
afternoon. The latter team showed im
provement over previous games and Cap
tain Walton expects to give the Olympics
all they want in Saturday's game. From
now on the Reliance men will take it easy.
All are in fine form for the game, Racine
and Lacuna both playing ftrong ends.
Sexton at tackle will give a good account
os himself and Wyckoff s punting is sure
and strong. In the game ibis afternoon
Stanford was forced to put in a number of
substitutes, several Varsity men being on
the repair list. This made the play of the
team slower and not so full of life.
The folio win â¢-â¢ gives an idea of the game
and best, plays of individuals:
Stanford had the ball for the first kickoff
and Reliance worked the ball down near
the center o! the field before Stanford took
it away from Reliance. Freeman at once
kicked for thirty-five yards, and Wyckoff
and Carter carried the ball back twenty
yards. Reliance interference showed up
strong. Williams, Stanford's center, did
some remarkable tackling and holding up
the Reliance uacks. Both Reliance ends.
Lacuna and Racine, prevented a long
game by Stanford. Cotton hit the line
harder tnan any other Stanford bacK.
Time was called for the first half with the
ball on the Reliance yard line.
In the second half Stanford kicked off,
and by kicking carried the ball over the
line, but it was not allowed on account of
offside play by Stanford players. Reliance
punted the ball out of danger and a little
later recovered the ball on a fumble. Rice
and Parker did fine tacKhng lor Stanford
in the second half. Jost made the longest
gain by a run in the second half. A Re
liance kick was blocked on the ten-yard
lince and Parser carried the ball over for
Stanford on the next play. Score: 4to 0
in favor of Stanford.
Reliance left lor the City this evening.

Fiesta.

Charming Attractions of
the Event.
COBONATION OF HER MAJESTY
The Opera-Honse a Veritable Fairy
land, Where Flowers, Fountains
and Mermaids Mingle.
AUBURN, Cal., Nov. 12.â 1t was at thÂ«
invitation of the Episcopal church ladies
that all Auburn went a chrysanthemum
ing- to-night, for it is they who are this
year in charge of Auburn's chrysanthe
mum fiesta. The exhibition is heW in
the Opera-house Pavilion, though veil it
might have assumed the nature of a street
paeeant, for never did old Sol seek his
evening rest leaving behind such a beau
tiful day. It is unusual for Auburn,
nestled as she is between olive-covered
foothills, to experience really unpleasant
weather at any time of the year, but to
day nature has indeed been kind, to her
foothill folk.
Officialdom nodded its head sagely over
chrysanthemum beauties, for the Queen
was crowned by City Attorney E. F.
Wright, and Hon. G. W. Hamilton, as the
Mayor's legal representative, , presented
her majesty with the keys of the city. As
preliminary to the principal feauture of
programme, the floral display, the spec
tators were held in the opera-house to
witness the production of the beautiful
extravanganza, "Cinderella."
The Queen directed the performance
herself, assisted by J. A. Predom and Mrs.
A. D. Fellows in the leading roles and C.
O. Davis as stage manager. The stage
was a veritable flower garden, and beneath
each fountain stream lay a little mermaid
and every lily blossomed a fairy queen.
After "Cinderella" the pavilion, with its
mass of blooming loveliness, was thrown
open to an eager throng eutside of the
matted walls of chrysanthemums of all
shades, the olive branch and the palm
predominating in decoration. Among the
principal exhibitors weae: Mr? 1 . Judge
Prewett, William Watts, Mrs. Huntley,
Mrs. E. O. Smith, Mrs. W. B. Lardner,
Mrs. Humilton and Mrs. Boardman.
The fiesta is on for three nights, closing
Saturday with a grand ball. Its success is
well assured, and all honor the chief
moving spirits, Mrs. E. O. Smith and Miss
Mabel Bronson.

SEATTLE'S QUEER CASE.
Stephen J. Overton Is Forced to
Testify Against His Bride
of Three Days.
An Attempt to Cheat Justice Ends in
the Woman's Conviction of
Robbery.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 12.â Stephen J.
Overton tilled probably the most peculiar
role of his life this morning â that of ap
pearing as a witness against his bride of
these days. The bride, too, filled not an
ordinary role â that of a prisoner charged
with robbing the man wno three days ago
made her his wife. Essie Winters was
tbe maiden name of Mrs. Stephen J.
Overton.
The Call last Tuesday told the story of
the marriage between Overton and Miss
Essie Winters.
The latter robbed Overton in the south
ern part ot the city in September last
She and R. J. Gould, with whom she was
intimate, were arrested and confessed all.
They were sent to the County Jail. The
Winters woman received repeated calls
from Overton ; in short, he was in love
with her and Tuesday afternoon they
were married.
Under the law of this State a husband
cannot testify against a wife, or a wife
against a husband, except where a crime
has been committed by one aeainst the
other. The police say that the marriage
was nothing less than a conspiracy to save
the Winters woman and Gould from the
State Penitentiary.
This morning the case against Overton's
bride came on for trial in Judge Humes'
court. She and her counsel expected
that the court would not permit Overton
to testify aeainst his bride, but Judge
Humes fooled them.
That little exception in the State law
which says virtually that the husband can
tesiify against the wife where she has
committed a crime against him was not in
Essie's favor, and Judge Humes made
Overton testify, much against his will.
Overton went on the stand and told in
detail how he had been robbed by tbe
woman who later became his bride. He
said that be married his wife because he
loved her.
Then the bride went on the stand and
swore that what her husband said was
untrue. She admitted that she was with
him oi the night of the alleged robbery,
but claimed that she did not take any of
his money. The other evidence against
the woman was strong, she having con
fessed ah to the police.
The jury found her guilty. Her counsel
say. they will appeal. The case has ex
cited the widest interest in this city and
during the trial the courtroom was
crowded.

CRUEL DECEPTION
Lures Many Home- Seekers
From the Lone Star
State.
Twenty-Three Texans, Five With
Families, Bunkoed by a
Polish Jew.
ANOTHEB COLONY IS COMING.
Fleeced Victims Left to Ponder Over
Their Folly and the Land
Agent Levants.
SEATTLE.Wash., Nov. 12. -By a fraud
ulent land transaction M. McCofski, a
Polish Jew, is $230 in pocket and twenty
three adult Texans, five with families,
have been transported from their homes
at Bremond, in the southern part of the
Lone Star State, v to the strange but hospi
table shores of Puget Sound. They arrived
at Seattle via the Northern Pacific, paying
in addition to $10 apiece, for which they
were each to be located on a homestead
claim of 160 acres of land, $45 a head trans
portation.
McCofski, â¢who ia as destitute of home
steads as honesty, appears to have worked
his swindling game upon unsuspecting
Texans wholly through the medium of
the mails, claiming to be the head of a
concern styled the Washington Land Com
pany. He represented that be resided at
227 Poplar street, this city, and so he did
until within about four days prior to the
arrival of his victims, when he snddenly
disappeared, leaving for parts unknown.
The authorities are searching for McCof
ski, who is said to have practiced similar
frauds In the middle Northern States, but
with little prospect of locating him.
Fortunately most of those who came so
many hundred miles on false errands
have money â some enough to purchase
return tickets, which a few will do, while
others will remain and make the best of
the situation. Four or rive of the num
ber found employment to-day. Those
here report that another colony was ex
pected to leave Bremond for Seattle a few
days alter their departure, having also
been fleeced in a similar manner by Mc-

ST. LOTJIB, Mo.. Nov. 12.â Miss Frances
E. Willard, president of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, has com

in all parts of the world, chiefly in 1896.
She enumerates that women have about
succeeded in gaining admission to the
general Methodist Episcopal conference
and have been successful in preaching the
Gospel in all but the Episcopal and Cath
olic faiths. She says:
"Women are engaging more and more
in business and their occupation embraces
nearly ail the trades, arts and prolessions.
Out of 451 colleges and universities in the
United States only forty-one are closed to
women. All the others are now co-edaca
tional, and besides women have 143 schools
of the higher education with 30,000
stnaents. One-fourth of the fellowships
of the University of Chicago are held by
women. Eleven States and fourteen col
leges or universities are represented.
Three women fellows have given in
struction in the university this year. Of
400,000 teachers in the United States 42
per cent are women; in England the pro
portion is even greater. Russian giris are
thirsty for knowledge. There were 500
applications for the 150 vacancies in the
entering class for the higher course for
women at the University at St. Petersburg
at the recent examinations. There are
123,955 women teachers in England.
"Twenty-live States have given the edu
cational ballot to women. One, Kansas,
tbe municipal, and Wyoming, Colorado
and Utah have made them full citizens.
The Russian Government has assigned
an annual grant of about $4Â»,000 to the
medical school for women in St. Peters
burg and the city undertakes to provide
$11,500, while private munificence has
raised an endowment of neai ly $200,000."

BIG SWINDLING SYNDICATE.
Five Persons Arrested and They Are All
Prominent in Business Circles
Except One.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 13 âThe" Her
aid says this morning:
The beginning of tbe end of the swin
dling syndicate supposed to have been
headed by William R. Valentine, now
under arrest in Brooklyn, has come.
Five arrests have been made, the pris
oners, except one, prominent business
men. More arrests will follow soon.
Among them is a man in a Western State,
who is settling his affairs preparatory to
going to Europe. His property is worth
$1,000,000.
The names of those^now under arrest
areas follows: R. E. McLaughlin, Daisy
Hampton, John E. Hoffmire, John D.
Hoffmire, Edward Records.
Daisy Hampton, 19 years of age, and
Charles Waldring, aged 29 years, were ar
res'.ed in Hoboken late last night after
having been caught in a swindling opera
tion involving $700.
Waldring was identified as R. F. He-
Laugblin, who is wanted in New York
in connection with previous swindles, and
who has been recoguized as one of Valen
tine's former friends.
Tbe most important find, however, was
the charter issued by the State of West
Virginia to the Standard Case and Iron
Company and the United States Trust
and Title Guarantee Company, which Val
entine used to procure commercial ratines.
Some notes and cnec&s found were
signed by J. H. Bakor & Co., while others
bore the name of McLaughlin.
John D. Hoffmire is tbe con of John E.,
and the two formed the firm of John E.
Hoffmire & Sen, which failed last July, it
being stated that they had been swindled
by note-broters.
It now turns out, however, that they
are accused of being in league with mem
bers of the robbinff syndicate.
Edward Records was arrested some
days ago at the request of the Boston
police, charged with obtaining by false
pretenses bonds valued at $33,333.
It is now charged that he was the agent
of the syndicate to rob in Boston in 1895.
Letters and telegrams have been
found which show that he was well
acquainted with the fraudulent notes that
were discounted by the Phoenix Contract
Company, the firm name under which
Valentine and Abbott did most of their
business.

ON THE COLORADO
BOUND FOR YUMA
Thrilling Trip of George
Flavell and a Com
panion.
Through Awful Gorges the Lone
liness of Which Is Most
Appalling.
SOLITUDE WORSE THAN DEATH
Tossed About by Unseen Currents
and Hurled With Mighty Force
Over Cataracts.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 12.â "1 cannot
say 1 should like this trip again," writes
George Flavell, the famous trapper and
hunter. Last fall he left Yuma and went
to Green River, Wyo., tbejheadwaters of
the Colorado River, and, securing a stont
boat and getting a companion as daring
as himself, he started down the Colorado,
bound for Yuma, over 1500 miles distant,
pasting through gigantic gorges and un
tracked wildernesses in the heart ot the
mountains. A friend in Yuma received a
letter from Flavell, dated at Lees Ferry,
on the Colorado, October 13. In the letter
Flavell tells of some of the features of his
exciting trip.
"The loneliness of these frightful gorges
is something insupportable," he writes.
"The solitude is more impressive than
tl-.at of deatn. It is like a visit to chaos
or a sudden glimpse ot the moon at close
range to see these awful walls hanging
black and threateningly over our heads
for miles and miles. In many places we
could look up at noonday and see the stars
shining.
"We arrived at Lees Ferry after forty
eight daya, during which time we traveled
some 891 milesâ s39 miles of tbe distance
between canyons, eight in number. Their
names are: Dolor, Ladore, Split Moun
tain, Usher, Stillwater, Cataract, Narrow
and Glen. The latter (Glen) is over 150
miles long and barren* in the extreme.
Not the least vegetation was to be seen
anywhere. Tne walls are aimost perpen
dicular, rising from 500 to 1500 feet in
height."
ia some of the canyons Flavell and his
companion passed through narrow escapes,
being swung with terr.fic force from one
wall to the other by swift and unseen cur
rents, dashed upon sandbars and hurled
through rapids. Fiavell, who long ago
gave proof of his intrepidity and ingenuity
?n emergencies, managed somehow to
keep from total disaster, running the most
dangerous cataracts with apparent fear
lessness and making camp at n;ght in the
trembly, dark shadows of gloomy can
yons.
"We are having far better luck than we
expected," he writes. "Since we entered
the Colorado only one oarlock has been
broken and only once has the boat been
filled with water, and that was owing to
my carelessness. The greatest fall in any
place has not exceeded ten feet to the 100
yard.*. The rapids are all short; very
few reach half a mile in length. Our boat
is just as sound as the day it was launched
at Green River, Wyo., and before six
weeks we hope to see the end of the grand
canyon and the last of the smaller can
yons, where there will be no likelihood of
a wreck. I have made the trip from
Needles to Yuma many times and of
course have no fears of that part of our
journey."
Flavell is known along the river by the
name of Clark as well as Flavell. Two
or three years ago he was one of the
R. E. L. Robinson party that visited Ti
buron Island, in the Gulf of California.
On that trip Robinson and a companion
named Logan lost their lives at the hands
of the Seri Indians, who will not allow
any whiles to land upon tbe island.

The edifice will be unique in design and
ornament to the city. It has been decided
to have it of iron, painted white, which is
to be the predominating color of the at

WOMEN IN WAR.
That the Fair Sex Can Fiijht Is Shown
by Many Experiences.
If the "new woman" needs any further
encouragement as to equality â or is it su
periority?âof the sex when compared
with men, she can perhaps derive it from
the knowledge that some of her sex are
very good fighters. By this is not meant
the class of women who engage in tene
ment-house brawls, but bona tide combat
ants, armed and equipped in ail the
panoply of war.
There are feminine soldiery in the Cu
ban army who are doing brave service for
the cause ot iibertv, and women have
been found of great service in other
conflicts. The French troops found in
their African campaign that the Dahomey j
Amazons were very good fighters, indeed.
The annals of all wars contain records
of women discovered fighting in the ranks
disguised as men. A few famous instances
are recalled by the Horse Guards Gazette
as occurring in the British army, Mrs.
Christian Davies, nicknamed "Mother
floss," served as a dragoon in several cam
paigns under the great Duke of Marl
borough, acting as a squadron leader of
the Scots Grays at the battle of Blenheim.
Hannah Snell was another female wor
thy who, having been deserted by her
husband, adopted male attire and trav
eled to Coventry in search of tbe run
away. She there enlisted in Colonel
Guise's regiment of foot and marched
with them to Carlisle at the time of the
Scotch Rebellion of 1745. She afterward
enlisted in Frazer's Regiment of Marines
and proceeded to Portsmouth, where she
sailed in Admiral Boscawen's squadron
for the East Indies. There she assisted
at the sie_-e of Pondicherry, where she
received tweive wounds. Through all her
adventures, including a couple of flog
gings with the terrible army "cat," she
managed to preserve the secret of her sex.
At the close of her military life, however,
she revealed her secret, and was awarded
a pension of $90 per annum.
Mary Anne Talbot served four years as
a soldier and sailor under the name of
John Taylor, and took part in severe fight
ing under Lord Howe in the early years of
the present century. Phoebe Hessel, ac
cording to her tombstone record in
Brighton churchyard, served for many
years as a private foot soldier in different
parts of Europe, and fought at the great
battle of Fontenoy, where ehe was "badly
wounded. King George IV personalia
interposed to give her a pension of half a
guinea a week in her old age. She drew
it regularly until December, 1821, when
she died in the 108 th year of her age.
Mary Dixon served sixteen years in the
British army, fougnt at Waterloo and was
still living in 1865, when she was described i
aB "a strong, powerful old woman."
Perhaps by the time America has an- j
other war women may be a t welcome at
the recruiting stations.
INSURGENT LETTERS
i Methods Used by the Patriots to Get
Them by the Spanish.
The question is often asked, "How do
[ the insurgents manage to forward their
i letters from the island, the ports of which
are in the hands of the Spanish?" In
very many ways which the ingenuity of
men and women can always contrive, but
the safest and most expeditious mesaen
| ger that the Cubans can choose is a prom
: inent loyalist. This has been repeatedly
tried, and the plan has worked to perfec
tion â somewhat as follows: A committee
I of the insurgents waits upon a wealthy
manufacturer or planter who is identified
with the Spanish cause. Tbey show him
a sealed package, inform him that it con
tains letters and request him to take it to
New York and there deliver it to the
â  Cuban Junta.
He indignantly refuses. The committee
insists: "You are well known as a loyal
ist; the authorities will never suspect you;
I yon can go and return without being
I searchedâ a thing which is impossible for
I one of us." And then a threat is added:
I "If you take tne next steamer for New
York, and if we get a cipher dUpatch j
I from the Junta saying that you j
have del.vered this package to them with !
i the seals intact, at the earliest possible j
moment, then we shall be much obliged
to you. and your property in Cuba will be
I safe. Bui if you refuse or delay your fac
tory will be destroyed by dynamite. Here,
by the way, is some of the dynamite" â
j and the insurgents show him a quantity
i of the explosive.
It is said that several eminent persons
in Havana â even officers of the volun
teers â have been thus terrorized, and that
in one case the unwilling messenger, on
his arrival in New York, actually made a
contribution, through the Junta, to the
insurgents' treasury, as the price of im
munity. â Harper's Weekly.
Bismarck as a Hand-Organist.
It is credibly related by a German jour
nal that during the reign of Emperor Wil
liam 1, when the present Emperor was a
boy. Prince Bismarck, walking one day
through a corridor of the royal palace at
Berlin, came upon a strange scene. Hear
ing within the room which he passed a
great racket he opened the door and saw
the young grandsons of the Emperor danc
ing about, while their father, the Crown
Prince, ground the handle of a hand-organ.
All were in high spirits, and, seeing the
Chancellor, the young Princes laughingly
invited him to join in the dance. Prince
Bismarck declined, but he offered to turn
tlie organ ii the Crown Prince would join
bis sons.
The Crown Prince consented and the
Chancellor turned the handle with great
animation. The lautrhter and sport grew
louder with the increased speed of the
playing. Just then the oI.J Emperor came
in. He took in the situation at a glance.
"I see. my Lord Chancellor," he said
with a smile, "that you are beginning
early to make the Princes dance to your
music."
]f the incident wa9 accepted as prophetic
it was soon proved illusive. Tne eldest, at
least, of the old Emperor's grandsons the
present Emperor â Oas never since tuen
danced to any one's music but his own.
Youth's Companion.
When Napoleon Learned Humanity.
Bonaparte had ruled men s hearts by
his use of a cause, securing devotion by
rude bonhomie, by success and by suffi
cient rewards; Napoleon quenched devo
tion by a lavishness which sated the
greediest, losing the affections of his asso
ciates by the demands of bid gigantic
plans. As he felt tbe foundations of his
greatness shivering, he became more and
more humane. Early in 1813 he said:
"I have a sympathetic heart like another,
but since earliest childhood I have accus
tomed to keep that string silent, and now
it is altogether dumb." He was mistaken ;
throughout that season be was profoundly
moved by the horrors of war; bis purse
was ever open for the suffering; the King
of Saxony was released from bis entangling
engagements; in spite of his hard-set ex
pression, on the retreat from Leipsic he
forbade his men to fire tbe suburbs of the
city in order to retard the pursuit of their
foes, and before he left Mainz for St. Cloud
he showed the deepest concern, and put
forth the strongest effort, in behalf of the
dying soldiery. â Professor Sloane, in the
August Century.

Urging that you exercise all vigilance in

* 'In explanation of this correspondence
Mr. Watt said last night:
"It has been the custom of former fetate
Central committees to employ watcaers
and an attorney to represent them during
the canvass of the official returns, and in
'all matteis relating to the interests of the
party before tho Board of Election Com
missioners during the canvas*. Major
McLuui.-h.iu and John D. Spreckels re-
Qnested me to act for the State Central
Committee in that capacity, and an inter
view was had resulting in the writing of
these papers.
"Pursuant to that arrangement I have
'personally attended before the Election
Commissioners daily since the day of elec
tion and at every meeting held by them,
and besides that have had constantly on
guard, night and day, men watching the
ballots i&.tuÂ« vauU, accompanying the
messenger in: taking the* returns to and
from the. Registrar's ottice to the rooms
where the Election Commissioners can
vass the returns, in keeping a special tally
of the returns, seeing that no returns not
properly certified are counted, and thai all
errors which might be of advantage to tne
Republican candidates for the State Senate
and Assembly are noted and a record of
them made for the benefit of those candi
dates in any contest that may be hereafter
made before the Legislature for beats in
that body.
'"The work which has been done, and
winch is now being done, is of the greatest
importance to the Republican party and
is essential to the protection of tne party's
inteiests. It has resulted in accomplish
ing this end in every particular where
tlieyhave been involved in tiie canvass.
"More than that. At the time when the
arrangement was made by the State Cen
tral Committee it was doubtful whether
the Slate would go Republican, and in a
close contest the work which is now being
done might be decisive of the result in the
State of California and determine it either
in favor of McKinley or Bryan, accord
ingly as the work should be carefully done
or neglected.
â  "It was to guard against this tendency
as much as anything else that the State
C ntral Committee entered into the above
arrangement with me. The work which
is now being done is entirely separate and
distinct from that which was done, under
the direction of the State Central Commit
tee at the late election during the count in
the booths on the National ticket. That
work was provided tor by a special fund
raised for the benefit of tho State Central
Committee and has no connection what
ever with the work which is now being
done for the committee under my direct
tion.
"Major McLaughlin of the State Central
.Committee positively declined to advance
any iunds for the benefit of the Republi
can County Committee or the campaign
committee or the purity committee. He
made those arrangements with me as an
individual, without any reference to the
to-called campaign or purity committee."
MARITAL TROUBLES.
They Cause Chris Savage to Swallow a
Dose of It at Poison.
Chris Savage, a barber at 6G634 Howard
street, attempted to commit suicide last
night by swallowing a dose of rat poison.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
and Dr. Fitzgibbon applied the usual rein
dies with satisfactory results.
Marital troubles are assigned as the
cause' of Savage's attempt. He has not
been long married, but in thai short time
lie end his wife have not lived- happily
together. About a week ago they broKe
up housekeeping, and she went to live at
409}Â£ Clementina street.
Last night ho hired a room in a lodging
house on the corner of Sixtb and Howard
streets. He told a friend when he left his
shop to call for him in ; fifteen minutes.
The friend did so, and found Savage suf
fering from the poison. He notified the
police and Savage was taken to the hospi-
.1. His wife called at the hospital to see
him last night. _

In Honor of hmve Women,
Ihe historic spot at Bvr.lll Stat:on, five
miles from L?xinKton^ Ky., on which
stood a fort, where a laiuous battle was
fought near the close of the last century
between the Indians and the white
bettlers, will soon be marked appropriately
in commemoration of that event. The
ocal chapter of the Daughters of the
American Revolution has taken steps to
jroct a monument on the site of the old
ort. Their most important work, how-
Jver, is already omplrued. for they have
jrocted at the spring at the foot of the
hill a memorial tablet on which are in
scribed the names of brave women who
risked their lives at the hands of tbe
besieging Indians to carry water to their
husbands, fathers, brother?, and sons
within the beleaguered fort. The battle
was fought on August 16, more than 100
years ago, and on August 10 next these
patriotic women will dedicate the monu
ment. The well has been inclosed by a
stone wall and otherwise suitunbly beau
tified. The next work of the Daughters
of the American Revolution will be the
monument for the fort on the hill.âCin

ENTERTAINED TOO WELL.
One Guest Couldn't Stand the Attentio
of the "Whole Hotel Staff.
Seated amid the palms and shrubberies
of the roof garden, with a soft vapor oJ
aftor-dinner cigars forming a luminous
haze about them, they were discussinjr the
liberality and charm of American hospi
taiily, says the New Orleans Times-Demo
crat. "Some years ayo," said W. T. Jones,
when it came his turn, "many of you will
remember that an Englishman witu more
money than sagacity built a magnificent
hotel at Cumberland Gap. There was noth
ing in particular to recommend the place;
it was out of the line for traveling
men, and possessed no attractions for
tourists, but nothing daunted by thesa
deficiencies the Englishman made it a
veritable palace. The appointments were
magnificent in every particular, and,
though I've put up at every hotel of any
consequence in trie country, I do not re
member ever to have slept in a more luxu
rious bedroom. 15ut guests persistently
refused to arrive, and one morning
when I legisicred I found only live
names on ti>e book. Nor was this
the worst, for turning back I found
even fewer names, until I came to
a space where for live days there had
teen only one man in the hou^e. There
was a man named Loon* is, now clerk at
tho Cordova, behind the desk, and 1 asked
him how things were going. 'Gouts!' he
exclaimed; then wilh a long face: 'When
you entertain a man so well that you
drive him out of the house, and he the
only euest, you're in a bad way.' There
upon he told me about the solitary guest.
It appears that he had called the leader
of the orchestra up and said to him : 'Do
you see that man? Keep your eye!
on him. lie's our only guest. We
can't lo c e him, or tho house must !
close, (iive him a ol a time, j
When he trees to dinner take your !
orchestra outside the door and play !
music for him. When he goes into the j
billiard-ioom follow him and play music ;
while he shoots the balls around. ' When
he goes to the bar follow him and play
while he drinks. Keep your eye on him,
bandmaster; give him music wherever he
goes.' Then he called the steward up ana
said: 'Keep your eye on that man. He's j
our only salvation. Give him a high old
time. None of his money goes at the bar. j
Throw open the wineroom to him; keep j
him supplied with the best cigars; serve
him the whole Dill of fare and have extra
meals sent to his room.'
"Then they started in on the guest.
When he went into the biliiard-room the j
band would play marches while he car- i
omed and dirges when lie massed. When
he came our. they would follow him to the |
bar playing a march, and wnile the bar- j
tender poured out bumpers of wine for
him they would discourse the drinkirig j
song from 'Taunhauser.' Circus music j
would be played while he walked around [
the corridors, and symphonies while hei
dined. After dinner relays of negro boys j
would bring him in cigars, and the .
band would play 'I Smoke My Last i
Cigar.' When he went to bed the bund j
played lullabies in tne hall and in the!
morning he was awakened with the re- i
veilJe and Mendelssohn's 'Spring Song.' j
For live days the guest was druiiK with j
the combined effects of food, music, cigars !
and champagne, and then all of a. sudden,
wliiie the band was following him to the i
bathroom playing 'A Life on the Ocean :
Wave, 1 he suddenly crew very white and !
fell all in a heap, rie was carried out on !
a shutter and taken to the hospital at )
Hagerstown. Within twenty minutes i
after he left thro : gue3ts arrived, and the j
hotel was saved."
PREPARING A MAP OF THE STARS
It Will Locate 30,000,000 of Them,
and Still There Are Others.
Few people are aware that the great
astronomical observatories of the world
are en; a^red at the present time in the
preparation of a map of the heavens in
which shall be definitely located probably
about 22,000,000 stars. The work was
authorized in ISB7 at a congress in Paris,
was begun in 18!J1, and has cost already, it
is estimated, more than $2,000,0C0. It was
originally expected that the map would
be completed at about the end of the cen
tury, but now it seems probable the end
will be reached before that time. When
finished it will be composed of 27,000 sec
tions, and if they should be connected in
their proper places the whole would cover
an area, of about two acres.
The possibility of making such a map
was suggested by the progress in photog
raphy, by which it was found tne camera
couid be ruacte to fix on plates what be
fore could only be se^n at intervals
through the telescopes. By this proces3
every star up to a certain magnitudeâ the
fourteenth, jis originally planned â will be
shown in its exict position, just as the
maps of the earth accuiately represent
the locations of cities and other object;?.
The stars to be represented on the map
comprise only about one-third of the
total number of those that have been
brought within the vision of man by the
powerful telescopes. An estimate of this
total number places it at 60,000,000. which
is about ten thousand times the number
that can he seen with naked eyes in all
the sections of the heavens around the
earth. Most men have experienced the
sensation of awe that attends a silent
contemplation of the heavens on a clear
night, and have been overwhelrueu by the
immensity ol the visible universe. How
much more marvelous is the fact that be
yond the blazing suns that meet the wan
dering gaze are millions more revealed by
the glass, and, for all we know, countless
other millions buried in the "darkness
behind the stars'' that have yet defied
science.â Chicago Tribune.

Wi.iianis.a prominent dentist of LocSport,

other day," said he, "one of the most re
markable cases of third dentition of which
I ever heard. An old lady of 70 years had
been toothless for many years, "fjhe wore
false teeth instead of her last natural ones.
"Sometime ago she complained of her
false teeth giving her gums pain, and at
last came to me to try and have the mat
ter remedied. Much to the surprise of
both of us, I found that she was catting a
new set of teeth. In a short time she had
cut an entire new set, above and below,
and they all seem to be as sound as the
teeth of a person in the prime of life. But
the thine that must seem beyond belief,
and which is yet true, is that one of the
new teeth had a gold filing in it.
"In a jaw tooth on the lower left side a
piece of gold about as large as a match
head was found, roughly, though- solidly,
imbedded in the crust of the tooth. The
only way the affair could be explained
was through the fact that the lady several
years aeo swallowed a gold filling ont of
her former teeth, and it is supposed to
have worked around in her body, like for

it came out in the remarkable manner I
have indicated."â Washington Times.

YOUNG DRUGGISTS
GIVEN DIPLOMAS
Emerge From the Chrysalis
to the Pillmaking
Stage.
University Fharmaceutic De
partment's Commencement
Exercises.
SOME ELCQUENT ADDRESSES.
Twenty-Slx Graduates R a ceive Di
plem?s and Five Certificates
of Proficiency.
The twenty-third annual commence
ment exorcises of the department of phar
raacv. University of California, was held
last nignt at Native Sons' Hall.
The hall was tastefully decorated with
the university colors, b^ue and gold.
From tha ceiling were suspended long
streamers of *old, while Japanese lan
terns of various odd shapes added to the
artistic effect.
On the stage were: President Martin
Kellopg, William H. Searby, Ph. C, the
dean ol the facility, C. Hadley Carson,
M.D., and most of the faculty in the phar
maceutic department.
The programme vas opened with the
overture, "Raymond." by the orchestra.
Rev. George Edward Walk, A.M., then
delivered an eloquent address.
It was introduced by reading the poison
scene irom " Komeo and Juliet," after
which Dr. Walk broadened out and
treated the general subject of pharmacy
in a very interesting manner, giving some
excellent advice to those just branching
forth in the profession.
After the rendition of n. selection from
Beyer by the orchestra Dr. ('arson deliv
ered thÂ« valedictory address for the fac
ulty. The address was interwoven with a
skein of spontaneous humor that kept the
audience laughing, while it appreciated
the good advice given to the graduates,
lie said:
"Let the example of the learned men in
the professions â they whose name? shine j
in the intellectual world as stars of the j
lirst magnitude â spur you on to an tffort j
at emulation. "He who makes two blades
of grass grow where only one grew before
i-i a true benefactor of mankind.'
"You have heard of the attempt, have
you not, to fix the philosophers' stone he- i
fore the sixteenth century? In this latter |
day ttie search seems to have resolved I
itself into making money by manufactur
ing soothing syrups.
"In those olden times such thinis as
ground ov.-ter shells, brick dust and vari- !
cus other articles of indigestible quality j
used to lorm prescriptions. Many â  man i
baa narrowly escaped disintegration while
pounding some shctgun prescription
around with a mortar and a pestle.
"Look at the ancient bolus, for example.
What a cumbrous thing it was. Now we
have pills of smail caliber but wondrous
powers of execution.
â¢'ln the drama of life we cannot all be
star players, but we fan at least do our |
best and keep the stern dictates of duty
before our eyes.
"Do not be discouraged because the lines
of your lives happen to fall in rough
places. It is a common thing for a phar
macist to be called from his corafortaole
couch at 2 o'clock in the morning to
formulate a prescription for a child af
flictfd with cholera morbii9 or colic.
"You carry with you to-night the best
wirbes of your alma mater, and her
earnest desire that you all may realize
your fondest amlr.tioin."
The candidates :or traduation were then
presented with their diplomas uj>on the
siage by Dean Searby.
He took advantage of the occasion to
compliment them all upon the work they
had done, and expressed the hope that
their lines of life would fall in pleasant
places.
As the graduates received their diplo
mas and stepped from the stage the
friends of each pave hearty applause.

The conferring o' the degree of graduate
in pharmacy fell to President Kelloeg.
"You have all attended the whole of the
prescribect course," he said, "and have
done the laboratory work required. Ac
cordingly, the board of trustees and the
faculty have recommended that you be
given diulomas of graduation. 1 take
pleasure in presenting them to you."
President Kellogg then stated that in
accordance with the general practice of
universities throughout the country before
taking the linal exercises for graduation
pupils were required to have served a cer
tain length of time in pharmacies to ac
quire the beneficial results of actual prac
tice.
He regretted to state that five of the pu
pils, through no fault of theirs, had
found this impracticable, and therefore
could not take the linal graduation exer
cises. Their names were the Misses Eliza
beth Dudley and Lida Talcott and Messrs.
Leonard Leavy, Armand Briggs and Ar
thur Deibert.
Amid generous applause they were
called to the stage and presented with
certificates of proficiency.
The exercises ended with a rendering of
the march "La Fiesta," by Roncovieri.
DOG AND HEN OHUM TOGETHER.
Black-and-Tan Scratches Up Worms
for Kaby Chickens.
Black-and-tan dogs are not expected to
earn their own living any more than dolls
and other such pets, but the Indianapolis
Sentinel reports an interesting exception
to the rule. As the itory goes, the mis
tress of the dog is also a deeper of hens.
One of these was sitting upon a "clutch"
of thirteen eggs and Don, the black-nnd
tan, soon became very curious to know
why she stayed in the barn so closely.
The dog, as it appears, had formerly
been given to teaming the hen, snatching
her food away from her and otherwise
making himself a torment, but the inter
course had gradually turned into friend
ship, and the two would sometimes be
seen lying and squatting side by side in
the sun on a bit of carpet in the back
porch.
During the three weeks that the hen
sat on her epgs Don used to pay daily
visits to the barn and sometimes would
stay with ncr by the half-hour.
Then the chicks came out of the shells.
Don was intensely interested. All day
long he scarcely lett the barn. Trie next
morning, when the hen stepped off the
nest and with a cluck called her brood
after her, Don followed.
The ben foil to scratching and the fluffy
chicks darted hither and thither, picking
up the tidbits which the mother had un
covered.
"Good!" said Don to himself; "I can
help in this business," and to the terror
of the chickens he ran in among them
and began turning up the soil at a lively
rate. Then he sat down and waited.
The mother hen called back the chicks
to the newly scratched earth and sooii
they picked it clean. Then tne dog took
another turn. And so the. good work
proceeded, to the great delight of ah the
parties.
THIS WHALE WAS A RACER.
She Drew the Uont Under unit the M>n
Had to Get Out and Swim.
Will Taylor, son of Captain Thomas S.
Taylor of the whaling schooner Rising
bun ol Princetown, has arrived home,
having left that craft on Hatteras ground
a few days ago with 2. r >o barrels of sperm oil
below batches, taken since leaving home,
March 30. Mr. Taylor went on the cruise for
the benelit of his health, which had br-en
undermined by close application to his
desk in a Boston postoftice. He tells of
one exciting incident of the voyage, by
which a boat's crew narrowly escaped
death. His story is as follows:
"July 8 we raised a school of whales
bonnd across our course and going fast to
windward. The mate's boat got away
speedily in chase, and with oars and sail
I attempted to overtake the herd. The
captain's boat followed, and we, hoping to
cut in ahead of the heard and believing
that a sail would assist, started to pÂ«Â»t the
mast in its step. /Before this could be
accomplished we met a big cow whale
squarely bead on, and an iron was socked
in on the instant. The whale proved a
lively one and full of light, and going in
an opposite direction to our course tore
the whale line from the bow chock and
swept it aft.
"IJut fortunately the line caught and
held under a cleat on the bow, or it would
have cleared that side of the boat of
everything above the rail. The boat was
whirled around, but the tow line being
out of place mace tho boat tow at an
angle. She began to move furiously
through the water with two men hurriedly
striving to prize the line into place. They
were unable to accomplish this, and the
boat began to careen and show symptoms
of swamping. One man lost his head and
jumped overboard, but was immediately
seized by my father and hauled in.
"The first tub of line ran out over the
bow at lightning speed while all this was
going on, and with equal rapidity the line
fro.-n the other tub began to follow suit.
But suddenly it snarled in the tub, and
nearly the whole bunch came out at once
and buzzed forward, striking with a thud
I and catching solidly somewhere forward.
Tht whirling mass of line narrowly es
caped catching our men as it passed across
the thwarts, and did catch a paddle, which
it whirled forward amid the ruck as if to
coin plicate matters.
"While the captain was rescuing the
man overboard the turns came off the 102
-gerheail, and but a half dozen coils re
; mained in the tub.
"The captain seized the line to take new j
'turns, but at that instant the boat went
j down head lirst. The captain was washed
j over the stern, and as he went snatcced at
j the long steering oar, but it passed
I through his hands and out cf sight under
water.
"I clung to the boat until I found she
was going well down, then let go, but I
went so deep that 1 swallowed lots of water
1 before 1 shot upward to the surface.
"When i came to the top of the water I
found all the crew swimming around with
only one oar to support tho entire num
ber. My father can't swim a stroke, but
! he had on a jacket whicb can be inflated
i witb air, anu he did very well by its aid.
"We kept up for a wiiile, when all at
once the boat came to ihe surface. The
line had pai ted and the whale had gone
clear.
"We clan? to the boat until the mate's
boat came to our assistance and picked us
up. We had been in the water about
fifteen minutes and had had sufficient
whaling for that day. Nothing was seen
I of that whale afterward." â Boston Daily

A PRESSING ENGAGEMENT.
How General John W. Foster Came to
Leave Clilnu.
Speaking of General Foster, I heard a
story the other day of how he persuaded
Li Hung Chanz to allow him to leave
China. The Chinese Viceroy became very
fond of Fos.er, and he offered various in
ducements to get him to stay in China
and net 03 one of the foreign advisers of
the Government. General Foster, how
ever, dirt 1101 want to stay in China, and
he told Li Hung Chang that it was impos
sible for him to do so.
"But why is it impossible?" said Li. "Is
it a matter of salary? If so, 1 think we
can fir that."
General Foster is a diplomat. He did
not want to tell the Viceroy that the real
reason for his not wishing to remain in
China was that he liked America better, so
he thought a moment and then evaaed ihe
question. Said he:
"Your Excellency knows I would like to
stay. I like you and I am fond of the
Chinese people, but I have an imperative
engagement in the United States for this
summer, which was fixod before I came
out here, and which I am bound to meet."
Here General Foster stopped. He knew
the curiosity of Li Hung Chang's Chinese
nature would not let him rest until he
was told what that engagement was. He
was not disappointed. In a moment the
Viceroy asked:
"What, general, is your imperative en
gagement?"
"It is with my grandson," replied Sec
retary Foster. "He is just seven years old.
I havn promised to take him out fishing j
on Lake Ontario this summer, and if 1 do
not carry out my promise I will lose lace
with him. He will think his grandfather
is not a man ofTruth, and 1 will sst a\ad
example for him. Now. your Excellency,
accoruing to the doctrines of filial piety '
and as a disciplo of Confucius, knows the
duties which a parent or grandparent sus
tains to bis child. You must see that I
cannot break my engagement."
Earl Li refl?cted a moment. No matter
how bright n Chinese is, ha is slow to ap
preciate a joke, and the Viceroy at lir.Â»t
took the matter in sober earnest. * He said
that if General Foster wanted to tiÂ«h he
could give him plenty of opportunities in
China. "Why," he said, "there are beauti
ful lakes inside the palace grounds. Tliev
arc full of all soits of rare and game fish.
If you will I will get you permission to
fish there."
"Ah! said Secretary Foster, "but how
about my g-andson and the doctrines of
Confucius? "
"Oh," replied Li Hung Chang, who by
this time had come to Â«c that General
Foster was joking with him, "if you don't
want to, we can't make you stay, but we
would like to keep you just as long as pos
sible." He did keep General Foster as
Jong as he could, and he was especially
anxious because he thought that Foster's
staying in China would make the path of
his own son. Lord Li, more smooth, and
mignt possibly save him from death. â

An Archbishop's Wit.
The stories that'nre told of Archbishop
Ryan's wit would fill a small volume. A
well-known priest called upon him one
day to ask tor a vacation on the cround
that his health required it. As he was
noted for his frequent absences from the
parish, the prelate could not let slip the
opportunity. He eranted the leave of ab
sence promptly, with a recommendation.
"The physicians say that you need a
change ot air. lather?" "They do, your
Grace." "How would it do, then, to try
the air of yonr parish for a month or two
as a change?"
He remonstrated once with a priest
whose silk hat hud seen its best days be
fore the war. "I would not give up that
hat for twenty new ones," said the preist.
"It beloneed to tny father, who fell in the
risinc of '48." "And evidently fell on the
hat," replied the archbishop.â Household

THE PHESIDEBI'3 REPORT.
She Gives a Most Satisfactory Account
of the Society's Present
Condition.
The Women's Educational and Indus
trial Union held its annual meeting last
night, and the following-named officers
were installed : Mme. Louise A. Sorbier,
president; Mrs. Paris Kilbnrn, Mrs. Nellie
B. Eysterand Mrs. P. D. Hale, vice-presi
dents; treasurer, Mrs. L. C. Fraser; record
ing secretary, Mrs. U. F. Kapp; corre
sponding secretarj*, Miss Marie B. Sorbier;
associated directors, Mrs. Dr. Cachot, Mr?.
Margaret Deane, Mrs. H. Lewis, Mrs. R.
Starles ajjd Mrs. Joseph Spear.
The advisory board for the year are:
Judge M. Cooney, Richard Chute, S. J.
Hendy, James D. Phelan, Joseph Spear
Jr., Mrs. Richard Chute, Mrs. S. J. Hendy,
Mrs. H. Highton, Mrs. Senator Maboney,
Mrs. A. A. Sargent.
The reports showed that the union has
been collecting the wages of poor women
when unjustly withheld. In the employ
ment department 392 women applied for
work and 200 employers applied for help.
The bureau is free to members and all
poor women.
The social department gave musicales
every Tuesday evenine, which were free to
all women and their escorts. The treas
urer reported $1010 in the treasury. The
secretary thanked in detail all the bene
factors of the union and paid a tribute to
Alme. Louise A. Sorbier (their president)
for having succeeded in keeping the
union open ard bringing it to the present
success.
Following the reports the friends and
members of the union present were fa
vored by Mme. Roeckel with song?, and by
Misi Treadwcll with a recitation. Mi-"s
Douglass played a mandolin solo. Re
freshments were served by the young
ladies of the union.
The president in her report expressed
the thanks ot the union to Mrs. Phebe
Hearst, Professor David Starr Jordan,
Hon. James G. Maguireand Marcus Rosen
thai for donations. She spoke as follows:
Friends and members of the union, this is
really a day of rejoicing for those of us who
are interested in this union, for surely our ef
forts have been blessed with succes.--. Three
years ago to-night a lew of us who would not
listen to tne idea of closing Hie door of the
union, believing we would be helped to keep
it open, were certainly net rejoicing. We
knew that a greot uphill work \%as to be un
dertaken, since It is easier to start a new in
stitution than to resusci'.ate a dying one, bu.
we believed it our duty to try and save it. and
certainly we were well rewarded for our perse
verance.
The following year found the union still liv
ing, continuing the good it was created for, not
in debt of one cem and hud still in the in-ns
ury .f'JSB; the next year our treasury bad $ - 289,
I jind this year it nas over $1000. I must not
I forpet nt ihis point to tell you that in our ef
forts to preserve the union three years ago 1
appile 1 to niuny of our wealthy citizens, ask
ing them to give our union onedollar a mouth
I to help toward its support. Several kindly ac
; qulmced and a few are siiH helping' us.
! Among those I wrote to whs our well-known
! philanthropist, Mrs. Phebe Hearst. Her kind
ittter alone wouicl have well encouraged us.
She promised us !?5 a month instead oi $1.
On the following Christmas s.he pave us
$LOO, and this year she has doubled her
monthly subscription, and we may well say
that she is the greatest beneiactor of our
union. Then Professor David Starr Jordan
gave us a very instructive and interesting
illustrated lecture which brought, back $295.
After this Hon. James G. Majcuire and Marcus
' Kosenthal gave tffe a debate which added to
j our treasury the sum of $2:21. And this year
400 of Our friends participated la a carnival
' which brought book 8012.
1 have been trying to procure the cleaning
I of our City Hall for the poor women. Ihese
! women, whom no one wiil employ because of
their age, and whom the Almshouse will not
admit since ihey are invalid*, are in great
need of work, and cannot get relief. Now our
City Hall Is In such a filthy condition that it
is a disgrace to the City, and these women
could keep it in a condition which would be
an honor to San Francisco besides being a
blessing for these unfortunate women who
because they are good and honest are suffer
ing, many of taem of hunger and coldâ a fact
which is a disgrace to our fair California,
where so much is done for the comtort of
criminals and nothing for this most deserving
class of unfortunate women.
In San Francisco we have many homes for
young women, but God help the poor old
women, no one wants them. Another thing
: we hope to have is a free gymnasium for
I women. How restful it would Ue for many of
our woman clerks and students who are bent
over a desk all day to have such a place to
benefit their heanh. Also our cooking school
needs many imorovements which are impossi
ble in this >,*.iihll house, and beside?, wo hate
I to p,o to iniy expense In a house which we may
have to leave ai any moment the landlord may
want it. In nearly all the cities where the
Women's Educational and Industrial Union is
in existence, they own their own home, and
certainly this union ought to have one.
DEAN PARRAR`S BOYHOOD.
In Hi* Youth Be Lived With Ear Close
to Nature's Heart.
. In "The Life Story of Dean Farrar,"
which appears with many illustrations in
the first number of the Temple Magazine,
we are told that he was 8 years old when
his parents returned from India. The
scene ' of his boyhood changed when '." he
was 8 years old from Avlesbury to the Isle
of Man, his parents having taken a house
on the shores of Castleton 15ay. During
the next teven years he lived with his ear
close to the heart of nature, in a spot
where the rush of life was unknown. ;â :
A love of nature has remained one of
the mo-t powerful influences of his life,
and the mention of the island still brings
to the Dean's tace a far-away look of ten
der memories. 'Ihe Manxman" is one
of his favorite books to-day; and he
sneaks in graceful praise of those graphic
pictures which Hall Came has drawn of
the institutions and scenery of the isle of
Man, pictures which will preserve to pos
terity much that is passing away before
the onward rush of the tourist. One
eviMit in his school life stands out with
awful vividness in the Dean's mind to
day. It was the fire in 1844 by which the
whole of Kirn William's College was de
stroyed; and tnat there was not one fatal
accident is due in part to "Fred Farrar,"
to use his boyhood's name, tor he was one
of the lirst to give the alarm. "I shall
never forget," he said, "waking up at
night with the suffocating smell of smoke
and, when I opened the door at one end
of the long dormitories, being met by the
bursting flames.
"I roused my brother, and we ran to
gether from bed to bed waking up the
boys. Then came the fearful suspense,
while v.c all stood huddled together in a
aark passage, waiting for the key to be
found lor the only sale door of exit; and
the joy when it was at length opened and
we rushed pell-mell out of doors, bare
footed and with scarcely anything on but
our nicht shirts! It was a December
night, and the cold was intense; but the
wonderful sight o! the flames issuing
ft om the windows made me forget every
thing else. It was the grandest and most
awful sight I ever witnessed. Fortunately
my brother and I had friends to take us
in; and afterward we were placed, along
with other boys, in a house, until the col
lege was rebuilt, and trusted entirely by
ourselves, without a master being placed
in charge."
A STRANGE PET.
It Was a Red *ox and Known by the
Xame of Koxie.
At Mr. Phelps' home camp on Minne
tonka there were, of course, a number of
dogs about, including Foule d'Eau, a litter
of seven puppies, a rattle-headed retriever
called Buffalo and a faithful old pointer
called Tige, now almost upon the verge of
dissolution after a long life of glory in the
open country. Poor old Tige ! It is one of
the saddest things of sportmanship to
have 10 see a favorite bird dog grow old
and hopeless. Tigt was so helpless he
could not walk far, but was anxious as
ever to go wne n lie saw us start out along
the woods road. He would walk a little
way and then give in, lying down in the
road and whining pitifully at realizing
that his strength waa gone lorever.
But most interesting of all the home
menagerie was the red fox called Roxie,
one of the oddest pets I ever saw. Roxie
is about two or three years old, but much
smaller than an adult red fox should be,
thanks to the life of captivity. In hei
youth Roxio would bite any hand ex
tended to her, but her owner whipped her
so conscientiously that lie broke her en
tirely of that habit, so that she is now
harmless. Roxie is, however, too wild by
ineradicable nature to be on terms of close
friendship with many. Mrs. Phelps can J
pick her up at will as though she were a
kitten, bin no one else can caich her with
out pulling her in by the chain to which
she is attached.
Sometimes 1 would get up to reaching
distance, and would scratch her ear, an
operation much relished by her and some
times she would eat from one's hand; but
always she did this under protest, with
little whines and grunts of protest ana
j contempt. As nearly as I could tell, that
i was just the feeling Roxie had for human
I beings â one of contempt. Sometimes she
| would stand and look at one with hereyes
I half closed in the most unmistakably cyn
ical fashion one tver saw. showing plainly
enough what was her estimate of human
ity. All day long Roxie was barely still,
but was running full length of the chain
most of the time, and very often carrying
in her mouth a chip or bit of wood, which
was her iashion of play.
She would dig holes in the earth to some
depth, but preferred to hide In her hollow
log, which served as a kennÂ«l. With the
reiriever puppy, a round, curly little fel
low of a few weeks eld, she was on the
best of terms, and would play with it by
the hour, never hurting it "in the least,
though often its sharp teeth must have
j hurt her ears. At night, when shut up in
i her log house, Roxie would utter a loud
wail of protest, a curious, indescribable
whining howl, blended with a snuhie or
cough. None of :he dogs about the house
ever troubled Roxie, and they seemed in
cluded in her general contempt for all
things mundane. â Forest and Stream.
A TERRIER'S DEVOTION.
Lost His Own Life In a Brave Effort to
Save His Master's.
To the sagacity of a fox-terrier dog Mr.
and Mrs. Dan C. Donovan, living 8^2521
North Grand avenue, owe the life of their
little son, Dan, aged 2 years. In rescuing
the child from a hideous death the saga
cious brute sustained injuries from which
it died after suffering the most intense
agony for more than two hours.
An effort was made to save the life of
the animal by amputating one of its legs,
but the poor little brute expired on the
operating table under the surgeon's knife.
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan and several of their
friends witnessed the operation, and when
they were told that their heroic little pet
could not survive the operation there was
not a dry eye in the party.
The tragedy occurred in this way: The
child wa3 playine in the yard* with the
dog yesterday afternoon when he discov
ered that the gate leading back to the
barn had been left open. He ran out onto
the sidewalt and was making for the
crowded street as fast as his chubby lees
could carry him, when the dog noticed
his peril and ran to the rescue. The
noble animal began to bark vociferously
and to jump upon the baby in an effort to
knock him down.
All uuconscious of his danger the little
fellow manfully held his legs and started
to climb down off the curbing into the
gutter. The dog took up his position in
the street and kept on barking and trying
to prevent the boy from going any further.
At this juncture a heavy wagon drawn by
two spirited horses came dashing by. One
of the wheels passed over the dog's hind
leg, mashinc it into a shapeless mass and
rolling the brute for some distance.
The canine yelled piteously and so
frightened the baby that he sat flown on
the curbstone and opened hi 3 eyes in
wonderment. Then he became frightened
and began to cry. The dog's howls at
tracted the attention of Mrs. Donovan and
several of the neighbors, who ran out and
picked the baby up just as he was in the
act ol scampering off down the street.
Had the child's mother been a moment
later he would in all probability have been
ran down and killed or frightiully
maimed, as the street at that point is
always crowded with vehicles of every
description. Two lines of electric-cars
pass the Donovan residence, and had the
little fellow succeeded in eetting past the
wagons his life would certainly have been
crushed out uuder these modern jugger
nauts.
Some one picked up tba dog and carried
it into the house. Mr. Donovan was tele
phoned for and arrived on the scene
shortly after. He sent for a veterinary
surgeon in the hope that the dog's life
might be spared by amputating the in
jured leg. Dr. Farrell chloroformed the
terrier and took off the macerated mfem
ber. but it was found that the cruel wheel
had crushed its vitals and that it could
not possibly recover.
The sorrowing little group that gath
ered about the operating table presented
a dramatic picture not without its pa
thetic side. The dog had been a great pet
in the family and was the constant play
mate and companion of his toddling little
master. It was so frightfully crushed and
mangled that every time it moved it suf
fered so intensely that it whined and cried
in the most pitiful manner. Its suffering
was eased by the chloroform, but before
the operation was finished th,e brute re
covered from the effects of the opiate and
again began to howl with pain.
As though it realized that it was going
to din, it raised its nead and crawled to
the edge of the table to lick the hand of
the baby whose life it had saved. The
effort proved too much for the animal and
with a gnsp that seemed almost human it
fell over dead.
There will be a funeral at the Donovan
residence to-day. Little Dan will bury
his pet with all the ceremony hi<i baby in
stincts have taught him. * Older hands
will dig the grave, but tne grief-stricken
toddler will cover the body witn earth
and he will not be the only mourner who
will stand about the mound.â St. Louis

Costly Foathers.
While there are probably hundreds of
men who make a business of killing birds
for their feathers, the best known of the
feather hunters in the we<t is H.imiin
Smith, the white chief of the Cocopah In
dians. Their reservation includes most of
the land on Madeline Bay. In the marshes
of this broad sheet of water are found the
egret, heron an>J crane In large number*.
Smith reached San Francisco a wees or so
ago with several bags of feathers, chiefly
egret. The load weighed lest than four
pounds, but it netted Mr. Smith $1575.
Even the heron's fsathers come high.
They fetch at wholesale from $8 to $10 an
ounce. One heron, Mr. Smith says, will
yield often feathers worth $150. If herons
are more plentiful than egret they are
more profitable hunting, because there is
only a smail tuft of covering on the greet
that is marketable. â Portland Oregonian.

FRAUDS EXPOSED
Gifted Authors Denounce
Phrenology and Phre
nologists.
The Ignorant Cheats, Buffoons
and Falsifiers Go Down Before
Scientific Facts.
Phrenology, or the manipulation of
heids, is a dirty and obnoxious practice,
and a source of danger also to the practi
tioner and to those whom he may iater on
examine professionally. A phrenologist
is liable to contract itch, leprosy, small
pox, or many other contagious and loath
some diseases, and communicate them
afterward to other persons coming in con*
tact with his hands during an examina
tion. The public should carefully shun
phrenologists and their deceptive and un
healthy practice, for serious consequences
may result from it, as has been proven in
many instances. It is largely through
imaginary youths and ignorant, unscru
pulous and unprincipled charlatans that
phrenological quackery has hoaxed and
deceived many simple people. What lit
tle prestige it has gained is being rapidly
dissipated by science. There are, how
ever, several of (he most debased phreno
logical frauds in this community who are
tontinually imposing on the people and
eking out a miserable existence by the
practice of their unprincipled methods.
For the benefit of those desiring a clear
comprehension of some of the many evila,
errors and false claims of phrenology, tha
views of a number of eminent authors and
scientitic authorities are herewith sub
mitted :
"We have already said that in our opin
ion Fool and Phrenologist are terms as
nearly synonymous ascan be found in any
language. " â Blackwood's Edinburgh Mag
azine, Jan., 1823, page 100.
"Phrenology * * The dogmatism and
arrogance of its advocates were really be
ginning to be tiresome â and the foilv had
lasted rather too long." â By Lord Francis
Jeffrey, M. P., famous Judge in the Scot
tish Court of Sessions. See Edinburgii
Review, Sept., 1526, page 31S. Carlisle
(Reminiscences 11., 14) describes Jeffrey
as "Instinct with honesty, intelligence."
"Phrenology * * One of the most ex
traordinary theories that ever disgraced
the unfortunate science of mental phil
osophy. * * No man of distinguished
general ability has hitherto announced
his adhesion to their creed." â Robert
Southey in Quarterly Review, London,
1836, page 182. Southey was an "eminent
English author." Coleridge (Biographia
Literaria) refers to Southey thus: "Beat
gifts of talent and genius, * â¢ subser
vient to the best interests of humanity."
"Where the phrenologist has made the
prognosis and we have ourselves cemparf d
it with the conduct of the party, has been
unfavorable." â Fraser's Magaz.ne, Lon
don ; 1840, page 509.
"The skull is, as any observer may
easily Batisfy himself, no good guide to
mental endowments." â Popular Science
Review, London, 1869. page 388.
"Experimental physiology and path
ology, by suggesting other functions for
much of the brain surface, are thus di
rectly subversive of much of the phrenology
of Gall and Spurzheim. * * Psychology
and experience alike contribute to discredit
the system and to show how worthless the
so-called diagnoses of character really are.
* * It is capable of doing positive social
harm." â Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth,
edition, 1885, pages 847 to 849.
The attempt to determine differences in
functional capacity from the examination
of the head evolved all the difficulties con
nected with the examination of the brain
and a great many more." â Science Supple
ment, New York, March 25, 1887, page
"The ignorance of those who practice
phrenology as iÂ»n art, their illogicality,
impudence and rapacity for fees. â¢ â¢
Every one is an unconscious physiognom
ist without having analyzed expression;
phrenologists make use of this common
ability in estimating character." â The
American Naturalist, Philadelphia, Pa.,
July, ISBB, pace 613.
"There is nothing in common between
modern cerebral localization and the
views of Gall and Spurzheim." â Century
Dictionary. New York. 1890, page 4458.
"Catchpenny bumpology â it gradually
fell well nigh altosetner into the hands of
quacks. It is not too much to assert that
to the majority of people phrenology is
thus associated with more or less vulgar
dens of its more popular expounders. To
incite the attention of passers-by these
persons generally adorn iheir consulting
rooms with hideous bald plates, each sup
posed to be typical of * * bumps, â¦ â¢
depend for their existence on the vulgar
craving for the occult."â Saturday Re
view, London, April 26, 1890. page 500.
"â¢Practical phrenology now is really but
a shrewd empiricism based on physi
ognomy, and not upon the classical bumps
at all. * * Physiology has quite extfn
guished the science of bumps." â Medical
Record, New York, Dec. ll r >, 1894, page 738.
Cerebral localization. * * Nothing so
far permiis us to suppose that there exists
a center of judgment, a center ot intelli
gence, a center of conscience, etc.'' â Le
Progress Medical, August 15, 1896. Trans
lated and published by Pacific Medical
Journal, San Francisco, October, 1896.
"Another discovery retentiy made is a
big surprise to scientific students. It is
that the intelligence of human beings and
brutes does not reside * * in thefroDtal
lobes, or 'cerebral hemispheres,' which
com po-e thÂ» upper and front portion of
the brain. Durinjr many years past ex
periments repeated over and over again
nave seemed to prove this. * â¦ Professor
Munk of Berlin * * has succeeded in
removing the frontal lobes and the * *
patients have been apparently as bright as
ever * * as intelligent as before."â New

Irin CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The miners cheered the State.
The Assessors' convention comes next.
Can we have better tax laws? is the
question.
There is always a fight in sight for some
kind of reform.
If there is any such thing possible as an
over-production of gold, let us try it for
luck.
The campaign is exhausted, but Bryan
is not. It seems he has another speed in
the slack of his jaw.
An extra session of Congress would not
disturb business but benefit it. That is
the Republican way.
The miners will furnish us with gold,
but unless we patronize home industries
we won't keep it lonp.
Tom Watson has the consolation of
knowing he carried his own town, and that
is more than Sewail did.
The guessing at the composition of Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet has no end of variety in
it, and yet it is becoming monotonous.
There is still a chance for the Popocrats
to declare that Mr. Hanna is now encaged
in coercing men into McKinley's Cabinet.
Choose California goods to send to your
Eastern lriends and you will please not
only them but your neighbors here as
well.
There is no reason why Tom Reed
should desire to be Speaker of the next
House. He can rule it just as well from
the floor.
It is becoming more apparent every day
that tne election was not only an eye
opener for agitators, but a mill-opener for
industry.
The development of California during
this new era of progress will probably
have electricity for its motive power in
most places.
New reports of opening mills come in
every day, and before long we shall hear
of newly established mills and new enter
prises of ali kinds.
The political fijht is by no means ended
in New York, as the Plattites and anti-
PiattiteÃ are still at it on the old ground
and in the old way.
If all our industrial conventions could
work as harmoniouÂ«ly and as vigorously
as that of the miners tbe prosperity of the
State would be assured.
Old Miss Democracy may indulge the
hope of getting rid of Altgeld, but when
the next election come.i round she will find
the villain still pursues her.
The Dineley bin may do for a time, but
what the country expects is an extra ses
sion of Congress and a speedy return to a
thorouKb. system of protection.
The present monetary system is good
enougi. for business, but the ueticits in
the revenue show every month the neces
sity of immediate tariff reform.
There is abundant room for improve
ment in our State system of taxation, and
an assembly of Assessors ought to be able
to agree where to begin the work.
Tom Watson's long-delayed letter might
as well have been suppressed altogether.
It would have had no effect on the cam
paign and will not even be read now.
Every Tax Assessor in the State shou'd
attend tne coming convention at Sacra
mento. The sm ject to be discussed af-
JectÃ every county, and all should be rep
resented in the debate.
If Cleveland does not say something
about the Cuban question and the Nica
ragua canal in his next question he will
be a dummy as well as a h'guret.ead for
the rest ot bio term of office.
In the reviva of prosperity in this State
keep your eye on the sugar output. That
is one of the industries in which we have
not only a chance of making a ;en strike,
but good prospects of doing it.
We mny receive many home-seekers
from the Eist, we may get muc. capi al
from atroad. but aiter all the develop
ment o California from this time forward
depends mainly on Cai.forniaus.
The principle of arbitration in the Ven
ezuelan muter has been agreed upon and
Hie bas.s on whict) the settlement is to be
made has been determined, but the iacts
which arc to he decided on that basis are
still in dispute.
The Washington Post nays California
voted o'.j tbe <ar ff question, and cites it as
;i proof teat we are out of touch witn. the
rest of the Nation, but when the Post sees
he extra session at work it wjil find out
ihat California not only voted right, but
voted on the right thing.
A striking ilustration of the change of
popular MQtiment tn tbÂ« Booth is lound
in the fact that B -oker T. Washington,
the noted colored educator, recently a>l
dresbed the facility and students of Trin
ity College, North Carolina. This is said
to b<> the lir^t instance on record of a
Southern college for whites inviting a
negro to make an address to its students.
It li worth noting, moreover, that, while
the affair lia- occasioned coi-snlerable dis
cussion, it is being generally approved.
THE MINING CONVENTION.
The convention of the .Miners' Associa
tion his 'on.' its work wel. and has out
lined plans for the future which promise,
is effective. y carried out, to do much to
promote tiie welfare of the mining indus
try. It is therefore witn renewed hope
that the miners of California will return
to their work. They can now co forward
with a fair d gree of a:^surance that their
enterprises will be carried on under better
conditions in the future than have pre
vailed for a long time pan.
The resolutions adopted by the conven
tion called for several chances in the ex
isting laws of the State. These it will be
the duty of tfcÂ« Legislature to consider
carefully, a-id it goes without saying that
whatever the State can do to promote the
industry by amended legislation, or by
new legislation, will be cordially snp
ported by the Deople.
The miners also ask for National legis
lation, and this it will be the duty of the
California delegation in Congress to sup
port as i eartily in the future as it has in
the pa t. The request for the appointment
of a National secretary of mines an I min
ing with a teat in the Cabinet, is one that
will have the support of Congressmen
from all tne mining States. Such an of
ficial is greatly needed in this conntry.
The mines in the United States represent
an enormous industry which is affected in
a thousand ways by legislation. It is al
together right and proper therefore that
a representative of that industry should
aye an honored place in the councils of
every ai!ruin : stration.
For the rest it seems clear that the pros
perity of our mines will largely depend
upon bringing additional capital into the
State to work them. Modern mining has
become one of the most costly and scien
tific of human industries. It is only by
the use of expensive plants and processes
that the rich gold field 3of South Africa
have been developed and those of Western
Australia exploited.
In California we have hardly more than
scratched the surface of our gold-bearing
mountains, and if the same means that
have proven successful in South Africa
are employed here, there is no doubt great
results will be attained. To employ these
means, however, implies the control of
large amounts of capital, and while Cali
fornia is rich, she should nevertheless
arrange to get as much aid as possible
from the wealth of tbe world in the task
of this development.
The harmony of sentiment and vigor of
spirit shown by the convention give
promise of success in all the lines of Stale
work that were mapped out. The legisla
tion needed from the Nation can also be
obtained if the miners of other States act
with the same unity and energy aa thoÂ»e
of California. The wealth required from
the East and from Europe will come of
itself as soon as it is known that our mines
are profitable and can be worked under
laws favorable to their development. The
future, therefore, is bright in every respect,
and the people have pood reason to be
satisfied with tde work the convention
accomplished.
THE ASSESSORS' CONVENTION.
The next convrntion of note to be held in
thi? State is that which has been called to
meet at the State Capitol building on No
vember 23. It is to be composed of Asses
sors of the various counties and has been
called to consider the best means of re
forming the revenue laws of the State.
The present system of taxation in Cali
fornia is really a laclc of system. It has
been the outgrowth of exigencies arising
nt different times and in different coun
ties nnd results in creat injustice to tax
payers. The aim of the coming conven
tion is to petition the Legislature to so
amend the present revenue laws as to
make themjessconflic. ing, more equitable
and more effective.
It is also proposed to ass the State
Board of Equalization to form some
schedule to follow on the assessment of all
lines of personal property, as well as to
look into the present assessed value of
property, t'.ie object being to discover
where present evils extst, devise suitable
remedies for them and petition the Legis
lature to pass such acts as are necessary
to amend them.
It will be seen tl at the convention will j
deal with a subject which concerns every
taxpayer. The raising of revenues for the
maintenance of public institutions and
the carrying on of the government is cer
tainly one of the most important of legis
lative functions. Nevertheless, it is one
which has perhaps been less carefully con
sidered than any other duty which legis
lators are called on to perform.
In California the evils of the present
system are great, and have long been
recognized. It is certainly high time,
therefore, that some attempt should be
made to correct them.
An assembly of t he Assessors from all the
counties in the State wouid be a boay ol
experts who have had sufficient experi
ence to know where the evils lie, and it
may be assumed that among them will be
some wno have sufficient sagacity to
know what remed.ei should be provided.
Much eood may, therefore, be expected
from the a-sembly.
It is to be hoped that every county will
be represented, and that a plan of more
equitable taxation may be cevined for
submission to the Legislature this winter.
Tne reform has lons been needed, and
it cannot be too speedily effected.
HE MIGHT HAVE WON.
In the face of the enormous popular ma
jority for McKinley it seems almost in
credible to say that Bryan came very near
election to the Presidency. Nevertheless
tliat appears to be the fact. The Wash
ington Pout compiled a table from the
early returns whi^ h Â»hows tliat a change
of less than 25,000 votes would have mude
Mr. Bryan President of the Uni:ed States.
This condition of affaiis results from the
fact that the majorities at first recorded
for MtKinley in the States of California,
Delaware, Indiana, Wyoming, Kentucky,
North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and
W<st Virginia were very small. Tbe total
of these, according to the returns cited by
tne Post, was little more than 50,0 -0 T ese
States, however, cast sixty votes in the
Elecioral Colieee. It is clenr, therefore
that if *ometbin<; like 25,000 men had
voted for I'ryan instead of lor McKin ey
in those States their electoral votes would
have gone to him instead of to his oppo
nent, and McKinley, n twitSistanding tbe
popular majority of 1,000,000, would have
been a deieated c; ndiaate.
The correc ed ietu: ns show some change
from the ficures given by the Post, but
these do not materially alter the point
which it makes. The great tidal w: ye was
in faci dependent for its success upon a
comparatively smnll wave in a few States,
and a considera ion of this phase of the
election wli! probaoly lead to a revival of
the agitation In favor of electing Presi
dents by a popular vote instead of by the
pre-ent system.
-Ordinarily.the vote in the Electoral Col
lege fairly represent* the will of the, peo-
Pie; ami even in bis case, since SlcKinley

gravt might be the consequences in n me
c ec ii>n if the will of an overwhelming
majority of the American people -houid
lie rendered of no avail by reason of the
pecularities ot our present metDod of
electing Presidents. Tiie majority would
of course suLnnt to the vote of the Elec
toral Colle.e, for we have had minoity
Presidents elected be:or , a d may have
them again. Never. heLss, the sui jtct s
lot altogether pleasant to contemplate
and it is easy to imagine that issues in.ght
arise when the e.eition of a candidate
iiiidfr 8U; h circumstances would result in
serious evils to the country.
THE PUNDING BILL AGAIN
It is reported from Washington that an
a tempt will be made to <:et the Pacific rail
roads funding bill through Congress ut the
coming session. The report is not founde.l
upon very reliable information, since it
claims no other authority than the fact
that one of tbe friends of the funding
measure has sent his private secretary to
Was-hngton to Rather material for a
speech or. thesubjet; but, nevertheless,
it is worth while to pay attention to it.
The issue is a most important one for Cali
fornia and we cannot afford to permit the
slightest word of warning to go unheeded,
'ihere is no use arguing the question
over again in this State. It has been
so thorouuhly discussed here that every
piia>e of it is well understood. It
is of coarse possible that some form
of funding mijrht be devised which
would be satisfactory to California,
but it is not probable. Certain it is that
no such form has yet been mude public or
even suggested. The demand of the rail
road has been of a nature too onerous on
the people to receive any support from the
pubiic.
The funding bill proposed last winter
will probably be the one taken up during
the coming session, if any is taken up at
all. That bill after the fullest considera
tion has been denounced in tbisuity and
this State by men of all parties and of all
industries. It is not just or fair to say
that all who oppose it are enemies of the
railroad. Many of them indeeJ are con
spicuous for fair dealing in all the walks
of life and for moderation in language.
As a matter of fact the bill is opposed vir
tually by the whole people of California,
! and if any further expression of opinion
on that side were necessary, it could
easily be obtained by mass-meetings in
any and every city of the State.
The proper way for the Government to
deal with the defaulting roads is that in
which it would deal with any other debtor
who defaulted in his obligations. The
Nation should make no terms with tbe
I r;ch and powerful which it would not
make with the humblest citizen. We de
j sire no injustice done to that or any other
j corporation in the Union, but wo demand
I also that no privileges should be granted to
j any which would work injustice to tbe
j people.
WATSON'S LETTER.
Tom Watson's long lost letter has been
published at last. It contains nothing
new and it is just about as useful now as
it would have been had it been made pub
lic before the election. It will not be read
by many people, and in all probability
would not have been read even if it had
appeared when the interest in the cam
paign was sufficient to induce men to read
almost anything that touched on politics.
The document it is said would if pub
lished in full make seven columns in a
newspaper. That is a longer letter than
the people of the United States will read
from anybody. Even Watson when his
mind is hottest and his pen is supplied
with the best brand of vitriolic ink could
not make such a letter warm enough all
the way through to prevent it from falling
upon the public mind as unpalatable as a
cold pancake.
There is but one point in it deserving
consideration now. Mr. Watson says:
"No one regrets more than I do that the
Democratic managers in shaping their
fusion deals have considered those Popu
lists only who were getting loaves and
fisbos. They have lost sight of the great
army of privates whose honest hearts and
sincere souls form the strength of the re
enforcement Mr Bryan needs."
There can be no question of the truth of
Mr. Watson's statement that the fusion
managers really arrang d their combina
tion with the Populis.s solely or those
who were to get the loaves and fishes in
case of success. The rank and file of both
parties were treated liKe so many cattle
who could be traded and delivered by their
bosses at the polls.
The only excuse which the fusion lead
ers can urge for their conduct is that any
other combination than that which th*y
arranged could not have been accom
plished. Mr. Watson's own letter shows
that the spirit of Populism is so alien to
the spirit of Democracy that complete
fusion between them is impossible. The
fusion manngers did the best they could,
and certainly achieved a greater success
than the justice of their cause deserved.
Watson's letter will tend to make more
clear :be wide disagreement between Pop
uli-mand Democracy, and to that extent
wiL serve a good purpose, even though it
comes after the fight 13 over and when
comparatively few people will careenougti
about it to read even the digest which was
published yesterday.

CHARTER MAKING.
Bow to Eliminate the Jionara and Insure
'â -â ':â  <rt,Otl â > !â¢Â»!?Â»Â»â¢ nf. .
Editor San Francisco oiâ Sir: As no one is
opposed to ihe ad. piion of a new charter for
the government of the City except those who
thrive on corruption In pub ie affairs, there
should be 110 real difficulty in framing a
chirter which w uld be overwhelmingly
bdjpted by the better class of our citizens who
far outnumber the bad elements. There is
practically universal agreement that there
shoull be no politics in City government, and
yet Non-Partisuns never have succeeded in a
single city in gaining control of the govern
ment. Why is it that voters universal. y favor
p-'n-poiiioai government, but never vote tor
It? For the sole reason that no adequate sys
tem of government has been off .red by Non-
Fart.s.ins.
As a member of a committee chosen to out
line a new charter it is appropriate for me to
report some of the fundamental principles
agreed upon by the com. ait cc at it* first mt-ei
ing iast night for the consideration of the pub
lic, the proposed innovations on prevailing
methods rendering the publication of the sys
tem outlined important to an who are study
ing tlie subject of muntripal government If
these innovations shall appear to be desirabie
and practicable.
The objection to the power conferred upon
the Mayor in the charter rejected at the recent
election mÂ«y be entirely obviated in the mat
ter of appointments by r< quiring the confirma
tion ol such appointments by a two-thirds
vote of the Board of Supervisors, thusconform
ing to the uniform practice oi the National
Government in ihe matter of Presidential ap
pointments, which must be confirmed by the
Senate, v practice which has prrvailed for
more than a century aud given fuil natisfnc
tiou. Tho responsibility for appointment will
thus be fixed upon the Mayor, but any undue
exorcise of that power will be held in check by
the dirfti t representatives of tne people in the
Board of Supervisors.
A truly non-partisan Board of Supervisorsâ
in other words, a board which unaA lully rep
resent all parties and all industrial interests
is the most important consideration under
any charter which may possibly be adopted.
It U believed that such a board can always be
ejected by adopting the cumulative method oi
voting for candidates. In this way not only
political parties may secure a just proportion
of the members of t lk- board, but such organi
zations as the Wheelmen's Association, the
Liquor Dealers' As.soeii.tion, as well at the in
dustrial organizations, may be fully and fairly
represented iv Hie board by adopting ihe
meihod of cumulative voting, which is so sim
ple in operation ihÂ»t any voter of average in
telligence can readily understand and use it.
For example, if there are 60,000 voters one of
the minor parties having 5000 votes wouid be
entitled to one of the twelve members of the
Board of Supervisors, and by catting all their
votes for one member alone they would be
certain to elect him. This could be done by
giving him twelve votes instead of one vote to
each of twelve candidates, as is now done.
The practice of selecting candidates from
the several wards, as now adopted, should be
abandoned and tbe best men available for
nomination in the City should be elected at
large, since they in fact do represent the whole
City in all their acts and functions as a board.
But after the board Is elected and organized,
the members shall be assigned by lot as repre
sentatives of the several wards or districts, as
the case may be, and each member so assigned
shall be the special representative of the ward
or district to which the lot assigns him.
To secure a more complete and equitable
represents tion of the entire population, and
of the various political organizations aud as
sociations entitled 10 representation la the
municipal government, the number of Super
visors sbouid be at once increased to eighteen,
to correspond to the eighteen Assembly dis
tricts. In that way a party or association rep
resenting one-eightreuth part of the popula
tion would be entitled to one member in the
board, and could elect such a member by cast
ing all their votes for him under the system of
cumulative voting.
No law or ordinance passed by the Board of
Supervisors should become operative and be
in force until sixty days alter its passage in
order to give the people an opportunity to
veto it if tho law is obnoxious to tbe public
welfare. If within this period of sixty days 20
per cent of the qualified voters, as shown by
the last register, stmh sifsn a protest and pre
sent the same in due form to the Board of
Supervisors, any law against which such
protest In made shall be suspended until the
next election, 10 be then submitted to a vote
ot the people for adoption or rejection. By
thus lodging the veto power in the hands of
the people the disastrous influence and cor
rupting woik of the boss ana of boodle will
cease to vex and rob the City.
These general principles in brief outline are
now given the public lor unbiased considera
tion, and oti.er suggestions will follow in a
few days. Let us try to get a new charter that
is new in fact and that will meet the needs of
the City for yean to come.

Winding Stairs With a Double Revo
lution.
In one of the old quarters of Paris, near the
Palais Royal, stands a nii:e-story house, whicii
possesses a m st si' eu.ar and interesting form
ot winding siairs. Tne stai.way is situated in
the central court af the building, and is open
to the sky at the top. Its peculiarity of con
struct.on can best bo understood by reference
to tne accompanying cut, borrowed from the
French scientific journal, La Nature. It is
evident at a glance thut there are two separate
spirals intertwined, each turning in an op
posite direction. A person entering at the

bottom at the point marked A would ascend
in succession to each of the stories above, the
landing places in every case being indicated
b the letter A. Another person entering the
stairway at the same time at the point marked
B would also ascend in regular order to each
of the floors above, and all of his landing
places are indicated by the letter B. Tnese
landings are in every case on the same level,
but at the opposite sides of the circular well
containing the stairway. The two persons
Could keep continually within eight of one
another mid would be able to converÂ«e, yet
they could never get any closer together as
long as they remained on the stairs.
The form of stairway U more than a mere
curiosity, since not oniy can it accommodate
twice as many people hs a winding stairway
having only a single revolution, but it com
pletely separates the lodgings on the two sides
of the house. The opposite tenants on the
same floor cannot pass into one another's
rooms without first going down to the ground
floor. They might quarrel across the well, but
could not get at one another except by a labo
rious climb, which wouid prouably exhaust
their anger as we.l as their wind.
As funny a scene as any writer of farces has
ever imagined would be presented by a couple
of quarreling tenants on this Parisian stair
way running up and down from landing to
landing, shaking ihe r fists and hurling epi
thets at one auother, yet never able to get near
enough to come to blows.

WOMEN OF LOS ANGELES.
They Are *ot I>ish,-i>tmetl by th* lie feat
of the JEftMl Suffrage Amend
tntnt.
On IRSt Monday afternoon the Woman Suf
frage headquarters, in the Muskegon b o. k,
presented an animated scene of more or less
agitated femininity. Ko one gave tho least
evidence of tie bitter disappointment that
had come to tnum through the iailure of San
Francisco and Oak;aud to carry the eleventh
amendment.
They had had time to put defeat behind
them and had already begu .â : to make plans
for a renewal of effort, and a very cheering
factor in this determiuation was the con
sciousness that Los Anue.es Couuiy had given
the 1-rgest majority in the State for woman's
suffrage.
Tnis gathering was in respo: se to the call of
the presideut for a last meeting oi the county
campaign committee and was called to order
at halt past 2 o'clock.
The first important order of exercises was
the report Oi the rinanci.il secretary, Mis.
GrÃy, which disciosed the fact that all ex
pe i"Â»es were paid and a small balance re
mained iv pledges, as eood as cash in hand,
with will, h to s'art a new lund.
Tue corresponding secretary, Mrs. Lulu P.
Littie, followed with an admirable report,
sbowlne much hurd work accomplished in
correspondence, including an eiab rate report
of the elec.ion returns on the amendment.
This wa. loiiowed by a report ot ti.e chairraun
of the press committee, giving a delated ac
count ot pre^swork done by thi- various me n
bersof the commitu-e and commending many
others who had aided the committee by timely
and appropriate contributions to the .russ,
which tnroughout the country has been liberal
and courteous beyond expectation. This re
port was accepted with a rising vote of thanks
10 the chairman.
A committee was then appointed by the
chair, consisting of Mrs. Gray, Mrs. Ludlttm
and Mrs. Little, to take charge of hII unfin
ished business of the county committee, aud
by a unanimous vote Mrs. Gray was made cus
todian ot all the property ilia, had b en ac
cumulates by tue committee during the cam
paign. Mrs. McComas then presented the 10I
lowing resolutions, which were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, A majority of 3003 (so far counted)
of the voters of Los Angeles . ounty have suown
ihi'inselves in favor of progress and civilization,
having stead fast.y upheld the American p.iDCi
ples of univerial lib rty and equality before the
law by voting for the eleventh amendment: there
fore be it
Jifsotved, That we, the Los Angeies County
Vv utuan suffrage campaign Committee, in regu
lar session assembled while we recognize in the
aefpat of woman's suffrage in the .State a menace
to good govern meut from a large c.a-<s of the
voters who have declared against ilils political
reform, so essential to in- upbuilding of our com
mouwealta, most gratefully acknowledge the
generosity and fair- njlnde ; ness of .he men of tnis
couuty tv ttieir noble enorts in our behalf during
tbe c. nip-tijjn aud at the polls.
Â£:solved. Thai we highly esteem and appreciate
the sjiUndid service of our country newspapers
which have so liberally granted Â»pace In which to
present our cause, and acknowledge without Hesi
tation that our work would have been more than
doubled without their timely and Invaluable aid.
liffolved, Tliat we fully appreilacc the value of
the quiet, constant and 1 nae^reisive individual
worn of hundreds of women in Dbls county who,
while not laying aside inetr domestic duties, so
simplified them as to be enabled 10 givo time and
means to bring about our final victory; anl we
leel assured t.^at they could never drop back
where they were before this battle begun, but will
be ready lor further actlou when the time arrive t
for another tfrort to pla^e our State upon a higher
political p ane.
Resolved, That while we know that It would be
unjusi to discriminate among so many Â»Â»lf-deny
ing workers, we ran .ot cios our campaign with
out a grateful menaon of our faithful president.
Mrs. L;izle 11. M-Rerve. and our era. lent financial
secretary, Mrs. Almedla B. Gray, who have served
daily at headquarters, with m> thought of compen
sation save tue ulilma;e suciess of the committee
in carrying the count/ lor woman suffrage. No
words can express the gratitude of thl-. committee
for such loyal service, without which other work
erj would have been less efficient and the labor of
the campaign lesaeffectlve.
Jiesoived, Thai while we deplore the present de
feat lv ihe state we will, encouraged by tho gal
lant help of our husbands, fathers and brothers,
press forward lv this just causw until every cou.ity
tn California is as willing as our own 10 grant to
women all 1 lie rights of cUizenship.
Jiesoived, That our corresponding secretary be
instructed 10 convey in writing to T. p. Stirosou
our sincere thanks for hi* generous loan 01 ibe
four rooms we hÂ»ve so comfortably occupied as
headquarters, aud 10 the Los Angeles J- urn. ture
Company and Barker Brothers for furniture
loaned.
Hesolted, That these resolutions be published In
the Sun f'ranclsco and In all the county newspa
pers, and a copy spread upon our minute's.
A motion was then carried to adjourn sine
die, as the organization had existed simply for
campaign work and its task was completed.
Mrs. Ada J. Longley Immediately presented a
resolution calling a county convention to be
composed of two or more delegates from each
precinct club, and from this to form a perma
nent couuty organization. A temporary com
mittee was elecied to take the matter iv hand.
Mrs. Meserve, chairman; Mrs. Little, secre
tary; Mrs. Lydla Rees. Mrs. Georgiana Hodg
man, Mrs. Margaret Rice. The ca.l was signed
by repre.-eutative women in the various pre
cincts and will be published.
Thus it will be plainly seen that though
much of the work 01 the present campaign
must be repeated the suffragists are equal to
the task and are confident of final success.
The work will, tn the next two years, be even
more systematically arranged, although this
county led the State in systematic work, tnd
the experience gained In tills campeign will
make the one that is to follow more successful.

Chairman County Press Committee.

STEEL KING OSHIMA

Experts.
T. Oshima, the technical director of the
gigantic steel works to be erected in the
coal fields of Southern Japan, and who
will be the king of the iron and steel busi
ness in the land of the chrysanthemum,
left last evening on the east-bound Cen
tral Pacific overland. He was accom
panied by the four expert engineers who
came from Japan with him.
Mr. Oshima will stop for a few days at
Chicago and then go â¢to Cleveland. In
both of these cities he will make a careful
study of the steel business. He wants to
examine the best plants, and when he has
done so and decided on what he wants he
will spend $2,000,000 for machinery for
Japanese use.
But Mr. Oshima is looking at other
things also. He wants to make a study
of electrical power, with the view of intro
ducing it in Japan, and will therefore no
to Niagara Falls and examine the monster
electrical works and the strange ways of
utilizing the power of the falls.
When he has done this he will proceed
to Birmingham. Sheffield and other great
iron and steel centers. He and his ex
perts will be gone many months.

The will of the late Henry Wolter- has
been filed for probate. It bequeaths $40,000

bequests, but I am acting solely on my
own judgment and for myself, as has
always been my habit in any and all my
business transactions."

THE WIZARDESS
OF THE DANCE
Loie Fuller Arrives in This
City on Her Way to
China.
ihe Wiil Wave Her Clouds if
Drapery in the Pa ages
o Peking
A GUEST OF LI LUNG CHANG
riow th^ Chubby Girl With the
Tawny Mane and Sprightly
Heels Gets Around.
Loie Fuller, the ftirl magician of the
dance, the tawny- haired wizardess of
motion, is now on her wav to whirl her
clouds of drapery in far Cathay. This
blue-eyed little Cbicaso woman, with red,
round checks and turn-up nose, that
danced herself into the lively heart of
La Loie Fuller, the Tawny-Haired Wizardess of the Dance, Now in This City on Her "Way to
Peking, China, to Whirl Her Clouds of Drapery Before Li Hung Chang in His Palace*
Western civilization, will now slrip into
the dead and solemn courts of the East.
La Loieâ that's what they call herâ but
after one talks to her for a moment
"Sissy" -eemi about the most appropriate
thing to call her, so sisterly, jolly and
good-natured is she. La Loie, who arrived
in this City yesterday, is bound for China
under a special engagement to dance be
fore the ereat Vicetoy and a few of the
most lofty gold-buttoned mandarins of
Mongolia.
When the marvelous, nimble-heeled
Miss Fuller first heaves her billows of
skirt in the royal palace at Peking she
will have an audience of one. and that one
will be the most critical she has danced
be ore. It will be no less than the Dowager
Empress of China, and this real ruler of
the Flowery Kingdom will then pass
upon the mystic movements that have set
the world to whirling with them.
When Li Hung Ouang was in New York
a few mon.hs ago he met Miss Fu ler, and
he went down at her sprightly feet, yellow
jacket, three-eye 1 peacock feathers and
all, and thn result was an invitation
couched in Li's solemn French dictum to
put China on her list.
Her manager, Edward A. Stevens, ac
companied the Viceroy to China and male
all arrangements lor the lew performances
to be given in Peking, which will be ex
clusively before the celestial nabobs in
their pa;aces. Nothing lower than a yol
iow-jttckei will view Uiis incarnation of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13* 1896.
Terpsichore in |her fantastic, conceptions
of dance.
If La Loie is a dazzling phantom on the
stagf, at home she >s fascinating in her
simplicity. From her tawny mane, that
sticks "every way for Sunday," down to
her "merry twinkling feet," she is
nature itseif. She skips around the room
like a cirl stampeded from school, show
ing her hundreds of souvenirs, and makes
one feel that she is glad to see him.
Slie calls her mother "Ma," and springs
around from this article to that till the
visitor expects to see her heave the short
skirts of tier plain blue bouse dress high
in the air until rolling c ouds of
diaphanous cloth tilled all space. Sut
she didn't, and the reporter failed to see
the electric Fuller feet.
And how she can talk. Loie as a lin
guist is as oue "from w a yback," the place
from which sprinir extraordinary things.
She questions and then waits for the an
swer with al: the ingenuousness of a child.
She wants to know. As she turns over
the gits and letters and autographs from
Dumas, Fl:immarion, C ief JustiCÃ Fuller
(the reporter forirot to learn whether be is
a kinsman of La Loie), Li Hung Chang
and otuer greai ones in both hemispheres,
she tells of them.
She does a dozen things at once and
keeps her audience in a swirl, as she al
ways does, wiether in the theater or in
her parlor. Then she gave her visitor a
box of the cigarettes raa'le o the order of
Li Huns Chans, on each little cylinder of
winch is her name.
'Ob, you want to hear about my 6tart
in life, do you?" 'â aid she. "Well, I began
a little red- eaded tot in Chicago â 1 was
born in Chicaeo. and am a typical Weai
ern galâ and 1 ju9t dancad and danced
and danced my way along. I have been
kindly dealt with, and can only say good
words for all mankind.
"I like reporter-, and they say such odd
things of me. never one story like another.
How h:ive I succeeded? Weil, by just
doing things with a 1 mv m>t:h ."
Miss Fuller will play at the &la> donough
Theater to-morrow evening, then go south
for a visit, returning to play three nights
here before her departure for China.

The Live y Part the Ladies Took in
the Rec nt Election in
Humbo dt.
John McCallan, a prominent young
business man of Eureka, Humbo'.dt
County, is in town. To a Call reporter
last night he said the whole aspect of
business affairs in Humboldt has changed
for the bet.tr in consequence of the Mc-
Kinley election. Houses are being rented,
merchandise disposed of and money of
fered at reasonable rates. A new <ra has
dawned and the people are satisfied.
Referring to the Presidential campaign,
which was unequal, d in this or possibly
any other county, much crdit is due for
the grand showing of the county to J. U.
Bull Jr. and O. C. Gregor, secretary and
chairman of the Republican County Com
mittee, who were untiring in their efforts.
At the commencement of the campaign
the most enthusiastic and sanguine Re
publican could only hope to cut down the
fusion majority of 1450 votes of two years
ago, and as for currying the county tor the
Republican party, that was considered an
utt^r impossibility. Nothing daunted
Bull or Gregor, who commenced a cam
j paign and conducted it right up to the
I moment of the closing of the polls on
election day, which resulted in a ma
jority of 700 votes for the Republican
ticket, the lurgest Humholdt ever gave
and a change of over 2100 votes in two
short months.
Their organization was as near perfect
as could possibiy be. Hutidreas of clubs.
were organized under their management
and direction, and by all honest means
known 10 politicians they kept their ciubs
right up tv the highest points of enthu
siasm. The most isolated and sparsely
settled sections of the country were care
fully watched, and 500 trusted Republi
cans scattered throughout this district
were keeping up .1 correspondence with
the managers which kept them thoroughly
acquainted as to the exact political situ
ation in every precinct.
J. N. GUlett was elected State Senator
for the First District, A. W. Hill as As
sfmbhman from the Second District, and
E. C. Damon as Assemblyman from the
Ihird District. Mr. Gillett is a prominent
attorney of Eureka and carried the dis
trict by about 750 majority. Mr. Hill is a
bright youn attorney of Eureka, that be
ing his native town.
He overcumt' an adverse majority of 650
and was elected by a majority of 206. His
name is prominently mentioned ior the
speakersbip of the Assembly and he will
make a strong candidate for that honor.
Mr. Dimon, Assemblyman-elect from the
Third District, is a prosperous merchant
of Ferndale. Having the confidence of
thÂ«* business community he was eiected by
a splendid majorny.
The ladies of tnat county feel proud of
the vote of Humboldt upon the sixth
amendment, as it is called, it receiving a
majority of nearly 500, notwithstanding it
was deft-ated in the laree cities. In tbe
many meetings of the Equal Suffrage Club
of Eureka the ladies showed themselves
well informed upon the issues of the day.
Among the prominent and influential
members of that club is Mrs. John Con
nick, sister o! Hon. J. J, de Haven of Han
Francisco, who is president, and Mrs.
<ieorge W. Hunter, wile of Superior Ju ige
Hunter of Humboldt County. Either of
those and many others are as well in
formed about politic^ as any men in the
State. Speaking of the large manufactur
ers of redwood Mr. McCallan said:
"Notwithstanding the fact that redwood
lumber is exclusively the production of
California and is not subject to com
petition from nations of the world, p ob
ablv nobody In the State worked more
ardently for McKinley than did the red
wood manufacturers of H umboldt County.
"They believed tbe princ.ples for which
they were woiking were for the best inter
ests of the country, and in the better feel
ing which has existed throughout the
State since the election they already see
indications of the soundnes of their judg
ment. From their experiences in busi
ness, they know that great changes can
not be wrought in a day. and they know
that the chaos which for three or four
years has existed in their line cannot im
"m'diately give place to the prosperity
which from tne natural advantages they
enjoy would ordinarily be theirs. There
fore, they are not occupying themselves
with the condition of things, but are pre
paring with confidence for ihe future.
''Since November 3 there has been no
talk o: sliutting down the mills which
have with difficuby remained in operation
during the past two or three years. On
the contrary, plans have been made to put
in operation mils that have for a lone
time remained idle. During the year 1896
the total shipments of redwood lumber
from Humboldt County will not exceed
85,000,000 feet.
"There is every indication that the ship
ments during the year 1897 will be in ex
cess of 125.000.000 feet. M.my of tue d-al
ers throughout tne State had, prior to the
election of McKinley, persistently refused
to place orders for the replenishment of
their stocks. They are now placing or lers
with freedom and confidence, having no
fear of the future. With their own country
on a sound financial basis much has
occurred within the past few months to
give encouragement to the reiiwood mun
uiacturers. The total >hipments of rough
clear redwood to the Australian colonies
during the year 1895 amounted to 2,315,490
feet.
"Shipments to the Australian colonies
during the ten months ending October 31,
1896. amounted to over 4,000,000 feet, and
there are vessels now under charter to load
at Humboldt Bay for Australia to inctease
the shipments of the year 1896 to at least
7,000,000 feet. The markets of London
and Liverpool took no rpugii clear red
wood during the year 1895, while during
the ten months ot 1896 ending October 31
they took 4,932,293 leet.
"Another market which now gives
promise of material assistance to the red
wood industry of this State is that of Cen
tral America. Shipments are now being
constantly made to this market and the
indications are they will continue and in
crease. On the whole, tbe H imboldt peo
ple are satisfied with the situation."

Schmidt The election will take place at
the next monthly meeting, *"hich will
be held on Tuesday, December 1.
Attorney Schmidt of the association
stated that the case of Teuxberry vs.
Jones, which was to have been tried in
Martinez last Friday, was postponed be
cause of the inability of one of the attor
neys for the prosecution to bo present at
the time the cast- was set for trial. In al!
probability the case will come up for a
bearing within the next few weeks.
The ame warden of thi^ county will be
invited to attend the next meeting and
give his views on the question of game
protection and what he has done relative
to the prosecution of game-dealers who
have sold game out of season.
A vote of thanks was passed to the
game wardens of Alameda and Sacra
mento counties for their efficient service
in the discharge of their respective duties.
The association indorsed the appoint
ment of Alexander Vogelsang to the office
of Fish and Game Commissioner of ibis
State. The prrs:dent stated he had every
reason to believe that Mr. Vogelsang
wou d not givo his entire attention to the
h'sh side of the question.
Will Be Fired To- Day.
There will be another test of the 12-inch rifle
on the hill above Fort Point to-day, between
10 a. M. and 12 M. Three projectiles will be
fired under tho direction of the Ordnance
Corps. For some months the Santa Cruz Pow
der Company has been at work to produce
powder of the exnet grade required by the
Government ior 12-inch rifled rubs. The high
initial velocity of the projectile must be ob
tained without exceeding a certain limit of re
coil. The force of the rebound is measured by
a cylinder or cusnion of neutral oil.

BURGLARS ARE
BUSILY ENGAGED
Two Cases That Bear a
Close Resemblance to
Each Other.
Each Residence Entered Has a
Vacant House Adjoin
ing It
BOTH THOROUGHLY RANSACKED
In One Instance the F mily Was at
Dinner and in the Other the Occu
pant Was Giving a Lesson.
The detectives are investigating two
cases of burglary within the past few
days, each havinc a striking resemblance
to the other from the mode of entrance
and other points.
Tuesday evening about 6 o'clock the
residence of James Gossip, 816 Ellis street,
was entered while tbe family was at din
ner, and the presence of the burglars was
not known till after dinner was finished
and they had made their escape.
The adjoining house, No. 818, is vacant,
and the Key is in the grocery on the cor
ner of Ellis and Polk streets. Some one
called Tuesday afternoon to see the house
and hud carelessly left the frontdoor open.
Tbe burglars entered the vacant house
and went upstairs. In the rear of both
bouses there is a window on both floors
with only U;e dividing wall between
them. The burglars had opened the rear
window on tbe top floor of the vacant
house and reached over and opened the
rear window in Gossip's bouse, wliich was
unfastened. They were thus able to
crawl into the beuroom in Gossip's house
occupied by bis daughter.
Tney thoroughly ransacked tbe room.
Bureau drawers were relieved of tneir con
tents and all the jewelry in the jewel-box
was stolen. A purse containing a large
number of old and foreign coins was
stolen. The thieves we:e provided with
tools, as the lock of the jewel-box had
been picked.
After ransacking the bedroom they
went to the lront room. One of the
bureau drawers only ha<i been opened and
ransacked, which has led to the belief that
the burglars had been frightened away.
What Mr. Gossip mourns the loss of
more than anything else is a valuable
five-pointed diamond star presented to
him in Halifax, N. 8., twenty-five years
ago by the lodge oi Free Masons of which
he had been worshipful master fur several
years. An inscription is upon it which
would make it easy of recognition.
The police were notified of the burglary
NEW TO-DAY.
A DEFUNCT CONCERN.
Trustees Compelled to Sell the Citizens'
Telephone Company. .
ST. JOSEPH âThe plant of the Citi-
zens' Telephone Company in this city â¢will
be sold at the east front door of the Court-
house, December 7, 1896, by the United
States Trust ' Company of Kansas , City,
under a deed of trust held by the latter.
In the sale will be included all the switch-
boards, wires, poles, fixtures and belong-
ings of the telephone company. The
United States Trust Company has had a
claim against the telephone company for
more than a year, and took possession of
the plant several months ago as trustee.
In the meantime the telephone company
has had all kinds of difficulties to en-
counter, and application has been made on
several occasions for a receiver. The plant
has been kept out of the hands of a re-
ceiver by the united efforts of the stock-
holders and the United States Trust Com-
pany. An application for a receiver was
made by Daniel .Ransom a short time ago
on a claim transferred to him by the
Standard Underground Cable Company.
It developed that the â¢ amount due the
cable company bad been tendered, and a
receiver was denied. -. The United States
Trust Company was made defendant in
that action, as well as in several others.
The trust company holds 2000 bonds of $50
each, its claim against the telephone com-
pany amounting to $100,000. The prop-
erty will be Bold to the highest bidder.

and an investigation was made. The
marks of tbe burglar's shoes \wre plainly
visible on the dURr in the vacant house,
and the detectives came to the conclusion
that the shoes were either maae in San
Qnentin or the man had worn rubbers.
The residence of John McKenzie, 524
Eddy street, was entered in the same way
and about the same hour. of the evening a
week aero. Mr. McKenzie, who is a teacher
of mimic, was giving a pupil a lesson at the
time.. Tbe burglars entered the upper part
of the house and stole all the jewelry and
other articles they could lay their hands
upon.
The two adjoining houses are vacant and
the burglars effected an entrance to one of
the vacant houseÂ«, then they opened the
rear window and got access to McKenzie's
house.
The police are satisfied that the same
men committed both burglaries.

ANTITOXIN SERUM IS FREE TO PHYSICIANS
The State Board of Health
Has a Depot in This
City.
IT CAN BE PROCURED BY
DOCTORS.
Statistics Show That It Lowers
the Death Rate From
Diphtheria.
SOME SIGNIFICANT CHICAGO
FIGUKES.
A Health Commissioner Demonstrates
That Antitoxin Is a Won
derful Remedy.
That the preparations of the Board of
Health to repel the advance of a threat
ened epidemic of diphtheria were not ill
timed is showu by the fact that three new
cases of the scourÃe were reported at the
Health Office yesterday.
Of yesterday's cases two were in the
house of a family named Maguire, living
at 23 Borland street, and one in the home
of the Smith family at 3553 Seventeenth 'â 
street. Both houses were fumigated and
quarantined.
Since November 1 forty-seven cases of
diphtheria have been reported, of which
seven, or nearly 15. per.cent, have so far
proved fatal. - The Board of Health is fully
alive to the danger of the situation and is
already preparing to combat any further
spread of the disease in many ways.- ;
Quarantine vigilance will be redoubled
arm an effort will be made to have a sup
ply of the antitoxin serum, which is the
most efficient remedy for the scourge yet
discovered, placed within the reach of
local physicians should they care to avail
themselves of the opportunity to try it.
"01 course we do not believe that the
antitoxic treatment is.infallaibje." said
Dr. Morse yesterday, "but it certainly has
shown favorable results in a large number
of cases, and there is no reason why it
should not be eiven a thorough trial, and
particularly at this time.
"Some time ago th? State Board of
Health set aside a sum of money, $0000 I
believe, to obtain a supply of the serum
by the regular methods employed in
manufacturing it. I understand that a
large quantity was obtained, and that
depots have been established where it can
be obtained.
"The depot in this City is at the drug
store of A. L. Lensrfeld, 202 Stockton street,
â¢where it can be obtained iree of charge by
any physician 1 who is in need of a supply,"-
Inquiry at J^nsieia's last j evening
snowed that there was a supply of the
serum on hand ready for distribution to
physicians who care to call for it.
Though Dr. Morse is not so enthusiastic
over the antitoxic treatment as to declare
it infallible, there axe others who declare
it to be the greatest boon, and their state
ments are supported by figures.. In a re
cent issue of a prominent medical publi
cation appears the following in regard to
the matter: ;V ;\C *
So far as the testimony of physicians, based
upon their clinical experience, is concerned,
tins is overwhelmincly in iayor of the anti
toxic treatment, wherever their experience in
its employment lias Ijsou a large one; those
â wiiii less experience are often even more en
thusiastic.
It is scarcely ten months since antitoxin has
been used by more than a very few lavored
physicians, and it is a much, shorter time si net
its use has become at all general. In this
comparatively short time there have, however,
been published more or less definite reports o:
the results of the treatment in at least 15,000
cases. These are presented as by no means
complete, only the more readily accessible
journals having been consulted, but it is be
lieved to include all of the more important re
port?. Nor has use been made of such merely
general published statements without detail
as that mere have besn treated in France up
to the end of .December 2700 cases with a mor
tality of 1G per cent; in Austria, outside of Vi
enna, 950 cases with a mortallry ot 15.7 per
<:ent; in Croatia and Slavonia, 428 cases with
n mortality of 10.8 pergcent; in Berlin hos
jiitalE, 1500 cases, with & reduction iv fatality
of one-halt.
Still stronger is the showing made in
favor of the treatment by the report of
Health Commissioner Kerr of Chicago,
who. on August 31, 189r>, made public a
statement that the death rate from dfph
theria in his city was 53 per cent of all the
cases reported.
Later, on January 10 last, he rendered
another report, from which the following
figures are taken :
The number of cases of diphtheria
visited at request of attending family
physicians 1.1G9
Number of charity cases (no physician in
attendance) 52
Total l.riT
Number found convalescent on arrival..' dS
Number found dead on arrival 50
All other cases 1,1 OS
Total 1.221
Number found suffering from diphtheria
and treated with antitoxin 1,047
Number in which antitoxin was uot
used Â» 61
Total l.lOrt
Number recovered under antitoxin treat
ment 901
Number died under antitoxin treat
ment 8G
Total 1.047
Death rate under antitoxin treatment,
percent 8.93
Number in which antitoxin was refused. <>1
of these there died 3'_Â»
Heath rate where nntiioxin was not used,
per cent 52. 4G
The difference between the death rate of
53 per cent, reported by Commissioner
Kerr on August 31. 1895, and that of Â«.93
reported on January 10, 1896, after the use
of antitoxin serum had been adopted,
speaks for itself.
Antitoxin serum is obtained by inocu
lating horses with the germs of diphtheria
and separating from their blood the
precious fluid.
Horses are chosen because more serum j
cati be obtained than from other animals. '
Beginning with small quantities, the
injections into the veins of the horse are
gradually increased until the treatment
has been kept up three or four months.
By this time the animals have reached
the point at which they can stand the in
jection of 300 ccm. without other ceneral
or local symptoms than an oedema at, the
point of injection, and they are ready to
furnish antitoxin of value. A trocar,
vritb^* canula attached to a rubber tube, is
passed into the jugular vein of the animal,
and the blood allowed to flow throngh the
tube into sterile glass jars prepared to re
ceive it.
The jars are stood upon ice, after the
blood coagulates, for two days or more,
until the serum, which separates, may ba
withdrawn by a pipette and placed in
sterile receptacles.
Dr. Winslow Anderson is very emphatic
Is his uraise of the beneticial results fol-
lowing in the wake of anti-toxin as a
remedy for diphtheria.
Dr. Anderson is also a member of the
State Board of Health, and there lore in a
position to speak authoritatively as re
gnrds the present supply.
"We have an abundance of anti-toxin,"
he said. "The S;ate supplies it free to the
lioor when a certificate for its use is fur
nished Oy a regular physician.
"About two years ago an appropriation
of $0000 was nia'ie for the purchase of anti
toxin, and I doubt not "that several thou
sand dollars yet remain in the fund.
"The State Board of Health sees that
the medicine is properly distributed. The
local place of distribution is Lengfeld's
drugstore. There are also distributing
agencies at Stockton, Sacramento and Los
Angeles. -
"There is, as I have said, a most plentiful
supply on hand here now. There is
enough to last at least five days even in
case of an ep.demic. Why, if it came to
it, in four or five days we could have
enough here to treat an epidemic lasting
six months.
"Do I regard the use of it as beneficia' ?
Most certainly I do. I believe that, ad
ministered judiciously, it is of decided
benefit.
"We have used a great deal of it in this
City, and I have heard nothing but pra se
result from its use.
"if administered before a case reaches
the noseless stuge it most certainly has a
decidedly beneficial effect."
THE NEW CHARTER.
Suggestion on That Subject Made to
the Republican County Committee
by the Chairman,
Ihe Republican County Committee held
its regular monthly meeting last night at
headquarters, 860 Market street, Charles
Manwaring in the chair.
The chairman announced that the
Democratic County Committee had passed
a resolution authorizing the appointment
of c committee to confer witli the Repub
lican County Committee with reference to
putting up a joint ticket for a board of
freeholders to irame a new charter. He
had noticed also, he said, that the Elec
tion Commissioners had expressed their
opinion to the effect that they did not
think it advisable to hold a special elec
tion for that purpose. He mentioned
those matters in order that the members
of the committee might have an oppor
tunity of considering it between now and
the next regular meetintr.
The meeting then adjonrned.
NOW SEEKING A DIVORCE
The Vaccarezzas' Troubles Are
to Be Aired in the
Courts.
Union Tbaaksgiving Services to B:
HÂ»:d at the Santa Clara Av.*nui
Methodist Church.
ALAMEDA, Cat,., Nov. 12.â The late
troubles of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Vacca
rezza have resulted in a ?uit for divorce
beinc filed by the wife. It will be remem
bered that about the first of last month
Mary Vaccarezza threw lier husband's
belongings into the street p.nd later at
tempted to commit suicide because Eugene
refused to make up. While she was under
t tie doctor's care, hovering between life
and death, her husband stepped on a rusty
nail and was likewise confined to his bed.
It was during their convalescent days that
a truce was made and they were reunited.
The complaint which was filed this
afternoon says: "That on the Â»ith inst.
defendant struck her with his big, ugiy,
hard fist in the richt eye. which blow dis
colored said optic and" felled plaintiff to
the lloor; then defendant jumped on
plaintiff's back, grabbed her by the hair
and repeatedly jammed her head on the
floor, ana as a result theredf plaintiff was
unconscious for over half an hour. That
plaintiff has always been a true and duti
nil wife to defendant, and said as-ault on
plaintiff was wholly without provocation.
That defendant on last Tuesday, Novem
ber 10, grabbed plaintiff violently and
robbed her of $10, which she had in her
pocket. That *a:d acts so complained of
occurred at their residence in Alameda."
Mrs. Vaccarezza ask-< that out of the
community property, she be awr.rded one
bedroom fet with mittress, rocking-chair,
two chairs, two taWes, deskn and carpets,
which she values at $7'>, with alimony,
counsel fees and absolute divorce. SJie
also dÂ»sires to resume her maiden name,
Mary Forbes. The defendant is an em
ploye of the Pacific Borax Works, receiv
ing $50 a month. Tbey were married June
1. 1890. Mie is an adopted daughter of
Alexander Forbes, late United States Con
sul to Guaymas.

CRUSHED TO DEATH.
Sigmund Strauss Killed l>y a Mlsslon-
Street. Klectrlc Car.
After Jiving 84 years it was the fate of
Sigmund Strauss to be crushed to death by
a trolley-car. The accident happened on
the corner of Twenty-ninth and Mission
streets at 10 o'clock yesterday morning,
and a few hours later the old man's body
was in the Morgue.
Strauss was an inmate of the Pacific He
brew Home for the aged on Silver avenue.
He started to go downtown and attempted
to board car 1012 at Twenty-ninth street
before it stopped, the inotorman believing
that the old man would take an inside
seat. Strauss must have forgotten how
old he was, for he seized hold of the front
guard and tried to swing on the front
outside seat. He lost his footing and
pitched forward.
In an instant the old man's body was
under the step and the car crushed him
badly before a complete stop could be
effected.
Strauss was removed in an unconscious
condition to the City and County Hospital,
where he expired a few hours later. Sev
eral ribs were broken and there were in
ternal injuries.
The deceased was a native of Germany.
He was formerly a bookkeeper, and lived
at 282 Minna street.
J. J. Govey, the motorraan of the car,
was arrested and charged with man
slaughter. He was released on his own
recognizance by order of Chief Crowley.

RETURNED AFTER
TWENTY YEARS
The Interesting Adventures
of a San Francisco
Boy.
Ran Away From His Home
When Only Fourteen Years
of Age.
NOT LIKE THE PRODIGAL SON.
From a Messenger Boy to a R*spon-
sib c Position in a Big New
York Concern.
It The adventures of the prodigal son were
scarcely more interesting than those of
Harry H. Morton, who as a boy ran away
from his home in this City twenty years
ago, and up to the time of his return, a
few days ago, had not seen the face of one
of his family.
The story differs mainly in the fact that
Mr. Morton returns prosperous and re- !
spected by his fellow-men, while the bibli-
I cal character came home hungry and in
, raps.
Young Morton's teacher at school was
in the habit of reading tales of adventure
to her pupils, among. them the "Ragged
Dick" series, which almost every boy has
j eagerly perused and longed to emulate the
adventures of the hero, who, after many
adventures as a messenger-boy and errand
boy, rises to be a United States Senator.
Shortly after leaving school the lad se
cured a position as a district messenger
boy and as this was just what Ragged
Dick did he saw that he was on the high
road to the United States Senate. But
San Francisco was not New York and as
J the National metropolis was necessary for
success he determined to go there. â â ;'.
So one bright spring morning he left a
comfortable and happy home, bade his
father good -by on the way to work, failed
to show up at the messenger office, turned
his face N toward the rising sun and for
nearly a quarter of a century disappeared
from view.
It is true that it took him eleven years
to reach New York and lie is not yet a
United States Senator, but he has attained
a responsible position in charge of the
Jersey City branch of the great New York
Transfer Company, and has returned once
more to his native City to introduce his
lovely wife and the little Mortons.
Young Morton was but 14 years of age
When he too* his sudden departure and
he was not overburdened with the world's
good?, but his spirit, was light and the
'world was wide and he journeyed eastward
as fast as his means and circumstances
would permit.
Nothing was amiss that savored of hon
est work and brought an income and dur
ing the many years that elapsed before he
returned to his native city with his family
he tilled so many positions that it would
be hard to follow the course of his life. ,; â 
As an elevator boy in a hotel and later
as a porter he made a success, and : then a
fancy for ".the; stage struck him and he
made his debut before the footlights in
minor parts. .'â¢-.'; ;ir
JuÂ«t about the time that the managers
of the troupe with which he was traveling
began to look upon him with favor he con
cluded that railroading was: about his
forte and he put in a few years at that oc
cupation. . For a. while he worked as a
laborer in a clay. pit. Another turn of
fortune's wheel made him the assistant of
a chef in one of New York's big cara van
varies, and as in the other walks of life : he
followed he was successful, until one an
tacky, or perhaps â circumstances
provedâ day, he made a mistake in
the mixing 01 a pie and was soon looking
for another job.
Collecting lares as the conductor of a
downtown car in New York occupied bis
attention for a time . and â  then he â  struck
the . business that he has followed v ever
since. He gained a footing with the ; big
New York Transfer Company and rose
rapidly until .he was one of its most
trusted employes'. ;
..Some time after f becoming connected
with the Transfer Company ho married

A CHINESE DIVORCE.
Choie Seen Secures a Separation From
Her Lord, Chic Vow.
Mrs. Choie Seen's suit for divorcp from
Chic Vow was heard by Judge Slack yes
terday afternoon. Chinese customs do not
require a wife to assume ncr husband's
name, and therefore the plaintiff did not
ask permission of the court to resume her
maiden name. The complaint against
Chic Vow was that he deserted his fair
bride without her consent and that he de
clined to again live with her, though she
requested him to do so.
Mrs. Seen appeared in court resplendent
in a blue surtout, embroidered with black
silk, and wide, shiny-black trousers or
galligaskins. Her raven tresses were
combed straight back from her forehead
and tied behind with a pint; ribbon, while
her ears were burdened with large bluish
turquoise earrings, heavily ornamented
with sold and pearls. On her right wrist
she wore half a dozen green jade bracelets.
A green under-tunic peeped from beneath
the lady's outer garment. She wore white
*tocKtnps and pale blue sabots, embroi
dered with green silk.
The lady proved her accomplishments
in regard to Western civilization by sign
ing her name American style to her com
plaint, yet when it came to civing her tes
timony the services of an interpreter were
required.
The interpreter was a bashful little Chi
nese lady, who giggled very prettily when
I called on to take a seat at Judge Siack's
elbow to perform her duties.
Mrs. Seen said she was married to Vow
nearly three years ago, and that soon
after the wedding ceremony he left her
and would not live with her any more.
For that reason and because be refused to
provide for her support she had taken up
her residence at the Mission Home on Sac
ramento street in this City.
Miss Donaldina Cam obeli, a missionary
engaged at the Mission Home, corrobo
rated Mrs. Seen, whereupon Attorney
Henry E. Monroe moved that a divorce be
granted on the ground of desertion, and it
was so ordered.
The lady smiled her thanks upon the
Judge, Clerk McElroy and Bailiff Thomas
and walked happily from the room.

SINGLE-TAKERS'
NEW CAMPAIGN
They Are Preparing for
a Fight Before the
Legislature.
Several Supporters of Their
Ideas in the Senate and
Assembly.
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
At Least the Product of Labor in
California May Be Ex?mpt
From Taxation
â 
The single-taxers are making prelimi
nary arrangements for a campaign in tbo
next Legislature of this State, looking to
at least an advancement of their princi
ples. Toey recognize even now that at
best only a step forward can be made, but
that if accomplished will be regarded as a
concession in favor of single tax. Among
those who will make a fight in this direc
tion are Congressman James G. Maguire,
Joseph Leggett and J. Reynolds. Cha'r
man Alford of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee and Judge Dibble, Assem
blyman-elect from the Forty-first District
in this City, are ardent single-taxers, and
their influence will be thrown into the
struggle.
Reynolds, who is at present engaged in
the Registrar's office at the City Hall,
stated that "all the Democratic Senators
and Representatives elected from this
City stand pledged by resolution of the
county convention to vote for submitting
the aingle-taxers' constitutional amend
ment, and some of them â four or five â
have by letter declared themselves in
favor of it, some going so far as to demand
the single tax.
'â¢That leaves six Republicans besides
Judge Dibble, and he says that they have
fot to come in and make it unanimous.
Ir. Alford tells me that of the two elected
from Tulare, one is a single-taxey aud he
thinks the other is not hard to get."
Joseph Leggett said that as soon as the
Legislature meets single-taxers will draft
a form of constitutional amendment, ask
ing that the whole matter of taxation be
submitted to the Legislature.
"That," he added, "we consider to be
the better form in which to start the move
ment for reform in taxation. If the power
to exempt any class of property from
taxation were in the Legislature, then any
particular interest would be able to go
before that body. Upon convincing the
Legislature that it would be for the best
interest of the State and the community,
the Legislature would then have power to
exempt that property lrom taxation for
any length of nmu or for all time. All re
maining to be done would be to enact a
statute having that effect."
Mr. Lejrgett cited the endeavors of the
Merchants' and Producers' Association,
which will seek .to have an amendment
carried making it possible for the Legisla
ture to enact a law exempting from taxa
tion all products of labor in California.
"If the State would exempt raw ma
terial, capital invested in buildings, ma
chinery, etc., and also the products of la
bor, Oaliforna would be able to manufac
ture cheaper than the East.
"Another interest that has been mak
ing a good deal of a stir is shipping, taxa
tion on which is so heavy in this port
j it ;s excesdingly difficult for shipowners
I to compete with those of foreign ports.
To abolish their burden it is necessary to
get a constittitonal amendment. As we
cannot attain to this end at once, we are
' in favor of eetttng there steadily, step by
step, and when we lind an association
Jike the Shipowners' or the Merchants' and
j Producers' we join with them.
'â¢The single-iaxer's idea is to strike off a
tax whenever he can do it, unless on land
values. Every square inch of land must
be compelled to pay the tax, but the
product of human labor must be exempt.
"Some think it better to go for a con
stitutional amendment exempting " di
i rectly all personal property and improve
ments from taxation, aud providing that
all public revenues shall be raised by
single tax on land values. I believe Mr.
I Alford thinks this would be the better
j plan, :i but Judge Maguire, Mr. Reynolds
and myself think the other method wonld
I be more practical and more likely to se
i cure immediate results."
James H. Barry, the editor of the Star,
who :s a strong supporter o! the single-tax
theory, stated that a vigorous fight would
I be iuQilc at Sacramento by single-taxers
and their sunporters during the next
session ot the Legislature.

HE ENDED HIS LIFE.
Suicide of a Young Man at the Ocean
licarli.
The body of an unknown young man,
scarcely out of his boyhood, was found on
the hill above Land's End at the Ocean
beach yesterday morning by Claude
Qninney, who is connected with the Mer
chants' Exchange Signal Station at Point
Lobos.
Tne boy had committed suicide with a
large revolver that lay by his side.
The young man, who from appearances
had barely attained his majority, had in
tended to let the world know the reason
for ilia suicide. At the last moment he
changed his mind, for the little paper he
took with him remained untouched. He
sought the high bill covered with wild
grass, placed the muzzle of the weapon
back of his ear and pulled the trigger. The
body must have bean there two or three
day's. It was well cencealed by the tall
grass. vVhen he went to the beach no one
seems to know.
The face and body of the dead man
showed that sickness had a strong hold
upon his system. The clotheg were ragged
but neat. A few small articles of no value
were found in his pockets. The general
description in the Morgue is as follows:
"Face thin, nose prominent, hair and
eyes dark. One upper front tooth is miss
ing. Coat and v^st brown, trousers gray,
hat brown, pointed-toe shoes, brown neck
tie and blue shirt."
In the pockets were a briarwood pipe,
amber cigar-holder and a cheap match
box. Not a scrap of paper was found that
would give a clew to tne young fellow's
identity.
Nearly GOO unaddressed letters are posted
in England each week.

. Mrs. Susie Martin, Who
Killed Her Husband,
.â¢â¢â¢â¢: Acquitted.
Speedy Decision by the Jury
in Judge Wallace's
â¢ v Court.
HYSTEBIA OF THE PRISONER.
Formal Order That She Be Remanded
â¢â¢ to- the Custody of the Sheriff
Alarmed Her.
Mrs, Susan B. Martin, who shot and
killed her husband, John P. Martin, in
the City Hall last March, was acquitted
by a jury' in Judge Wallace's court yester
day on the ground of temporary insanity.
â¢The names of the jurors in the case are
as follows: E. P. Sjovall, Joseph I.
Twobig, M. A. Graham, George Lake,
John O'Connor, Matthew Culiigan, C. j!
Cheney, J. P. Flanning, Thomas Finn,
William Staham, C. M. Foster, Joseph
.vohn.
When court opened there was not a very
large crowd in attendance for the reason
that public interest bad subsided because
the acquittal of the defendant was con
ceded in advance.
Mrs. Martin, the defendant, was dressed
in her usual somber attire, though her
face was greatly flushed, in contrast with
the deadly pallor of her countenance dur
ing the earlier days of the trial. The
color in the prisoner's cheeks, however,
wqs. not the hue of health, but rather be
tokened the culmination of the excite
ment which a trial on a charge ot murder
would naturally arouse in a mind already
distraught by sorrow and misfortune.
Br. J. S. Barrett, wao performed the
"autopsy on Martin's body, described the
course of the bullet which inflicted the fatal
wound.
â¢Jonn Hayes, serpeant of police, testified
that he met Jack Martin at the ferry
â¢about 9 o'clock one morning in last
February. Martin told him that he had
been living with a woman and was think
ing of taking her forÂ»a trip to Stockton.
He also told of a visit by Mrs. Martin, who
was looking for her husband. Siie' was
â¢vv'eepinsr bitterly and said she wanted to
find her husband. She bpoke of hpr creat
love for Martin, though he had left her
without a cent or a bite to eat.
.*" A part of this testimony was stricken
out on motion of the District Attorney,
though none of the lawyers seemed to con
sider it of importance to either side.
, Ned Foster, whose wife is a sister of Mrs.
of Mrs. Martin, testified that he knew a
great deal oi the domestic life of the pris
oner and her husband, whom she killed.
He. said that Martin abused his wife al
most all the time from the date of their
marriage; tbat Martin earned $90 a
â  motfth. for awhile as a member of the Fire
Department, and afterward received $150
a month as a deputy County Cierk, yet
did not contribute a cent to the support of
Ws wife, but spent his money carousing
with "hobos" and evil companions, male
knd female. This sort of conduct began
while' Martin was encaged as a barkeeper
at the Bella Union Theater, and continued
until Martin's death.
â¢ Mr; Foster said he knew of a time when
Martin obtained $800 by b corrupt political
scheme, about the time he secured his po
sition in the County Clerk's ofhee. The
witness saw the mo'nev. It was in $20
â¢piecesâ two stack?, of $400 eacn.
"Do yob know how Martin cot that
money?" asked Attorney Carroll Cook.
"Yes."
â¢ . "How did he get it?"
.To this question District Attorney
Barnes objecte i and it wrs withdrawn.
, Mr. Foster testiiied that he witnessed |
several scenes of trouble between Mr. and I
Mrs. Martin, and had often advised her as
the sister of his wife to obtain a divorce,
buts.be said she couldn't doit, because
she loved her husband so much.
" Counsel for the tiefense, Thompson, de
r-l.ired tbat they had nothing further to
offer on behali of the prisoner and Dis
trict Attorney Barnes responded that he
had no additional testimony.
Â° Deputy District Attorney Walter S.
Hinkle made the opening argument for
the prosecution. He said tnat the shoot
ing of Martin by his wife, the prisoner at
the bar, 'was not denied and had been
proved beyond dispute. The only defence
that^had been ?et up was insanity.
The allegation of insanity, Mr. Hinkle
said, must be submitted to the analysis
and determination of the jury under the
instructions of the court. |
.. Mr. Hinfcle did not vigorously combat
the tLeory of insanity, but simply asked
the jury to account for the presence ot the
pistol in Mrs. Martin's pocket. He said
that the pistol was undoubtedly taken by
the.woman when she left the house with
the intention of shooting her husband if
he should refuse to go back to her or to
zive her some money. Mr. Hinkle ad
mittpd that Mrs. Martin had been abused
by her husband, but he mildly^ contended
that for all such cruelty she had ample
opportunities for securing a legal separa
tion.
"Are bullets to be substitutd for the
divorce courts?" asked Mr. Hinkle, and
with this conundrum he left the case with
tne jury,- having occupied seven minutes
in his speech.
Attorney K,owalsky addressed tne jury
on behalf of the defense. He painted the
unbappv life of Mrs. Martin, and de
nounced Martin as a monster ani a brute,
who drove his wile to desperation and in
sanity.
The devotion of the prisoner to her hus
band cl aring his sickne-s was extolled, and
Mr.' Kowalsky said that it betokened the
h'ero : sm of a woman who loved the man
she* had married better than she loved her
own life. He said that she had been be
queathed a diseased brain and that her in
teilectual powers were inadequate to with
stand the monstrous strain that was put
oh it by her hu-band.
The most cruel thing, Mr. Kowalsky
said, was the reply that Martin made to
"his wife when she appealed to him for food
because she was starving. Then on the
nublic highway, in the hearing of strangers,
he scoffingJy told her to resort to a brothel
for earning a livelihood.
Buch words may not justify the killing
â¢of sucii a creature as even John F. Martin,
according to the codes of the books, but
â¢there is a Jaw above the law made by
man, Mr. Kowalsky declared, and t:>is law
he invoked in bebÂ»lf of his client. He
pictured her as suffering from a frenzy
of insanity at the time she fired the fatal
shot.
Mr. KowalsKy expressed thankfulness
to the gentlemen connected with the Dis
fnct Attorney's office for the courtesy
that had been extended to the defense in
â t-his.CHse. He paid a tribute to the manly
fuirness and devotion to duty of District
Attorney Barnes, and he was sure that
ti.at officer would do what is right. But
i is is a case which appeals to the man
hood of every honorable gentleman, and
the' gentlemen connected" with the Dis
trict Attorney's office are subject to that
feeling the same as the rest of mankind.
Attorney J. V. Eddy occupied the
greater part of the afternoon in an elo
quent argument for the defendant. He
reviewed the testimony of the witnesses,
and concluded by saying that the killing
of Martin could not be disputed, and that
the only question for the jury to decide
was whether Mrs. Martin was "sane or in
sane at the time she fired the shot. If
sane she ought 10 be convicted and if in
sane she ought to be acquitted.
District Attorney Barnes closed the ar
gument for the prosecution. He Baid
tnat a murder trial is no place for sym
pathy or gallantry, and that the jurors,
as well as the lawyers, must do their
uty. It had been pleasant for him to
near the kind words of the attorneys on
the other side, yet he would cast behind
aim the compliments of the gentlemen
J proceed with the presentation of
wnat be said he was pleased to call "some
at iP roseculi . on '. s ideas of the case."
â¢Mr. Barnes said it made nÂ» difference
what kind of a life Jack Martin lived,
mat life had b?en wiped out by the
oiGOfiy sponge of assassination. It was
true that he had not gone outside the tes
timony to attack the defendant here nor
to protect th.- memory of the dead man,
because that is not a part of his duty. He
believed the witnesses who toid of Mar
tin s misdeeds and cruelty were truthful.
If he had not So believed he would have
called witnessed to disprove their state
ments.
Mr. Barnes said that the killing was un
disputed, and he agreed with couusel on
the other side in ihe declaring that ttie
only point for thÂ» jury to decide was
whether Mrs. Martin was able to dis
tinguish between right and wrong when
she shot her husband. If sane, convict
her. if insane, let her go. He said that
if the theory of counsel for the defense
were to be accepted it would come to such
a pass that if a woman should walk into
the courtroom and shoot any member or
ihe jury, or even the Judge on the bench,
slie could be acquitted on the ground of
temporary insunity by simply employing
Colonel Kowalsky or Colonel Eddy to
make an eloquent plea in her behalf.
Mr. Kowalsky excepted to the remarks
by the District Attorney.
Judge Wallace gave the usual statutory
charge to the jury. He explained that no
words used by the dead man would justify
a modification of the verdict from murder
in the nrst degree, provided the jury
should lind that the* prisoner was of
sound mind when she committed the act
of killing her husoand; that thr presump
tion was that the woman was sane at the
time, and that the question of her sanity
or insanity must be decided by the jury.
The jury agreed oir a verdict in just
four minutes. Two ballots were taken,
some members of the jury voting "guilty"
on the first ballot.
When the jury returned no one was
present to represent the District Attorney,
and Judge Wallace, becomine impatient
at ihe delay, appointed Attorney Sweeny
to represent that officer.
The verdict of the jury was then ren
dered in these words: "We find the de
fendant uot guilty, oecause of her in
sanity."
"When the verdict was uttered Mrs. Mar
tin burst into hysterical sobs and then
swooned. Just as she revived she heard
Judge Wallace deliver an order that she
be remanded to the custody of the Saeriff
in order tbat the question of her pres?m
sanity may oe inquired into. These words
brought to her mind the possibility of a
life spent in an insane asylum, and she
began to shriek, but was finally pacified
by her lady friends who had coiue to her
support.
The verdict was greeted with hand
clapping by several persons in the au
dience, but this demonstration was
quickly suppressed by Bailiff Curtis.
Judpe Wallace's order reniandine Mrs.
Martin to the custody of the Sheriff was
subsequently modified and she was per
mitted to go home with her relatives, it
being understood that she shall be in court
at 10 o'clock this morning. At that time
a physician's certificate wili be presented
showing that Mrs. Mart;n is not at pres
ent insane and she wili be discharged from
custody.
GOLD MINING EXCHANGE
Prompt Denial of a Report Re
flecting on the Insti
tution.
O.'ficers Assert Tbat the Exchange Is
on a Sound Financial
Basis.
A statement published last evening that
the Gold Mining Exchange was in the
throes of dissolution calls forth emphatic
denial. The managers of the institution
assert that the rent of the offices in the
Mills building is paid to January 1, 1897,
and that several members are ready to
put ud the coin at once if necessary to pay
the rent of the same quarters for another
year.
It is the impression of persons on the
inside that a clique of men desiring to get
possession of the exchange equipment
started the report for the purpose of im
pairing public confidence in the institu
tion.
J. F. Crosett, secretary of the exchange,
said last evening that there was no thought
of closing the doors of the institution.
The business was going forward in a man
ner satisfactory to ihe members, and every
thing indicated a permanent and success
ful career.
The following statement was given out
last evening by authority of the executive
committee, president and secretary of the
Gold Mining Exchange:
A statement appeared in sn evening paper
to the efft ct that the Gold Mining Exchange is
about to close as a financial iailure. Inquiry
at the office ot the exchange in the Mills
Building mils to show such to be the case, its
profpecis ior success now being greater than
lor pome time past. It is true that General
Turnbull resigned the presidency of the ex
change on October 1, but this was because of
the time and attention required by his own
private business and not for financial reasons
connected with the exchange. Willie some
mis Hikes may have been made in the past
concerning its methods oi operation, these are
raj'idly being overcome and the exchai.g^e is
to-day on & sound linanciul basis, owing no
man anything and pitying its bills promptly.
The officers of the cxchnnge an: at a lo*s to
understand the animus of tne statements pub
lished, and while a few of the charter mem
bers hnvt* resigned lor various reasons the
majority are in full accord with the present
management, and the exchange will be kept
open anil pushed to an assured success there
Leing more encouragement to this end than
at any itme since its organization.
1. R. Wilbur ot the Royal Consolidated mine
is now president of the exchange, and as soon
:is its reorganized plmis can be net in opera
tion the exchange will be able to lulnli the
object" for which it was founded, regardless of
the jealous animadversions oi its eneiaies,
The pnper publishing the alleged iailure
above mentioned has always been considered
a friend of the exchange and in au interview
Ke!d by officers of that institution with the
proprietor of that paper he expressed regret
for the misleading ai.d untimely publication.

HUNGRY AND NEGLECTED.
Rough Experience of s Pour-Ye;tr-Old
Child on Elizabeth Street.
"I'm hungry."
The speaker was a four-year-old, a little,
dirty, sad-faced, weeding boy, who had
about him many visible signs of neglect.
"Hungry, child?" asked a good-natured
woman. "Where's your mother?"
"Don't know," said the little fellow
beginning to cry very hard and rubbing
two dirty little fists into bis two tearful
eyes.
Poor little Georgie McKewen, who lives
with'tis parents at 8 Elizabeth street, be
tween Guerrero and San Jose avenue, was
having a hnrd time of it. His fat-her was
away at work. His mother was visiting
saloons. The little boy was at home, crv
inir with hunger.
Indignant women heard the cr? of the
kittle one and learned his story. Their
sympathy went along with their' indigna
tion and he got something to eat. But
four days passed and there was no fire in
the McKewen home. The child shlftpd
for himself as best he could. Finally com
plaint was made to the Society for the
P revention of Cruelty to Children. Officer
McMurray waÂ« sent to look up the case.
He found the mother drunk, the house
rilled with smoke irom a lire which had
been built on top of and outside of the
stove, and the household was in general
disorder and confusion. Mr.Â«. McKewen
was arrested for cruelty to a child.

THE MAP IS READY.
City Property-Owners Will Be Given a
Chance to Inspect It for
Thirty Days.
A representative of the City Surveyor's
office appeared before tne Street Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors yesterday
to request the payment of the money for
the work on the new City map, w ich he
stated Was now substantially finished.
Two weeks ago Mayor Sutro vetoed the
authorization of the Board of Supervisors
for the payment of this money, on the
ground that this map when accepted by
the City would become the standard of
judgment of the rights and claims of the
City and also of private property. He de
clared that a thorough examination into
tne accuracy of the map was necessary be
fore acceptance or adoption, and therefore
the map should be placed on exhibition in
a public place for sixty days, and,"further
more requested that an able Â»iud impartial
surveyor should be appointed to carefully
examine and report in writing on the ac
curacy and correctness of the map.
After the Mayor had again gone through
the arguments used in his veto, which were
favored by Supervisor Benjamin, the
Street Committee determined to lay the
matter over for thirty days, during which
time the map was to be open to public in
spection at the office of the Surveyor, in
the City Hail. Tuis delay is intended to
give property-owners a chance to see that
the r individual lot or lots are.properly
laid down on this map, which will be to
all intents the "organic" real estate law of
this City, if adopted by the Board of Su
pervisors.
RICHARD DEY TO APPEAR
He Will Be Asked This Morning
to Produce the Famous
Contract.
This Will Clear the Decks for Action
for ths Trial Which Will
Begin Next Mcndav.
The attorneys on both sides of the Fair
will ca?e are sharpening their battle-axes
and burnishing their legal arraor for the
great contest which will begin next Mon
day morning. Sufficient of its surprises
and complexities have already been pub
lished to show that it will be a celebrated
case in the annals of legal jurisprudence,
ana that a considerable part of the evi
dence will be of a conflicting character.
For this and other reasons there is ex
pected an interesting contest of skill by
the opposing counsel, and the court will
be presented with many very hard legal
nuts to crack during the progress of the
trial.
A preliminary bont will take place in
Judge Slack's court this morning, when
i the question will be argued as to whether
I the court shall order Richard Dey to pro
duce the now famous $500,000 contract for
the inspection of Deimas & Shorrridge,
attorneys for Dr. Levineston, the executor
named in the will. The finishing up of
this matter will clear the decks for action,
and the battle will be witnessed with the
greatest interest by the whole people of
the States of California and Nevada.

MONEY IS TO BE
HAD IN PLENTY
Holders May Soon Borrow
on Their Country
Properties.
The Leading Local Bankers
Take an Optimistic Look
at the Future.
PROSPERITY IN PROSPECT.
The Wheat-Growers Hava No Longer
to Look for Favors From
the Capitalists.
The rise in all farm products has placed
the farmers in a better position than they
have been since the panic of 1893.
As a matter of fact the drop in wheat,
and general hard times in 1593, acted as a
stopcock for the savings banks' output on
country property loans.
It is very different now. The farmers
are getting big prices for their products,
and the banks are not slow to recognize
that outside loans are as safe, at least, as
those in the City.
The semi-annual dividends which are
to be disbursed shortly, affect, to a certain
degree any action savings bank directors
might take in the way of loaning money.
Then, as President B. A. Becker of the
German Savings and Loan Society stated
yesterday, the desire to loan money on
outside property will bÂ« dependent greatly
on tee withdrawals from the bank at the
end of the year.
"As a rule," he said, "the Ist of Janu
ary is a date on which most business af
fairs are started or concluded. In either
case it means the withdrawal of funds
from the savings banks. It depends
greatly upon the amount of withdrawals
whether or not outside loans will be
sought.
"It is too far ahead at this time to say
that we will be ready to loan money on
country collateral, but I feel satisfied that,
conditions being normal (as t:.ev are
now), all savings banks will be pleased
to loan money ou outside properties
after January 1."
President Albert Miller of the Ean
Francisco Savings Union is strong in his
feeling of the country's prosperity.
"We have never ceased to loan on proD
erties in this City, but when Bryan was
nominated we shut down completely on
loans on country property. The other
savings banks did the same. Since the
election returns have come in and we un
derstand the road we are to travel things
are different, and we are open to do busi
ness :i'_'.iin.
"As to our refusal to loan money here
tofore on country property, i may say
that it was principally that the customers
who came to us were those who were deal
ing with other banks and were unable to
pay their interest. We do not care for
that kind of business. We have, to-day,
at our meeting of directors, passed favor
ably upon several applications for loans
on City property.
"lam satisfied ttiat by the end of the
year the savings banks, feeling secure in
the prosperous outlook, will be ready to
resume business ana loan all the money
the farmers require."
E. T. Le Breion of the French Savings
Bank acreed with what his confreres bad
to say as to the prosperous outlook. His
bank, however, like theHibernia, has con
fined itself mostly to loans on inside prop
erties.
The result of a canvass among most of
the banks of this City is to the effect that
money must be easier as tee natural re
sult of the feeling of security caused by
the defeat of Bryan.
ASSAULT TO MURDER.
Frank Moore, an ex-Convict, Impris
oned on That Charge.
Frank Moore, an ex-convict, was locked
up at the City Prison yesterday by Po
licemen Freel and McMahon on the
charge of assault to commit murder.
About ten days ago Moore and Frank
Johnson, 1122 Broadway, had a dispute,
and Moore pulled a knife out of his
pocket and stabbed Johnson twice in the
abdomen. Jobn?on hud his wounds
dressed at the Receiving Hospital, and
was taken home.
Moore was arrested two days later and
detained in the "tanks" pending the re
sult of Johnson's injuries. Johnson's
condition was precarious for a few days,
but be is now believed to be out of danger.
Moore has an unsavory record. He has
served terms ;in San Quentin prison for
robbery and burglary.
New Patrol Wagon.
The new covered patrol wagon, which re
cently arrived from New York, has been sup

J. Goldberg on the Improving Business
and the Increased Travel to
California-
Among the arrivals here yesterday was
J. Goldberg, president of Goldberg, Bowen
& Co., who has been in New York, Boston
and other Eastern cities ior the past two
months. Mr. Goldberg came by the
Southern Pacific limited, the first train
of the kind leaving for the coast this
year.
â He brings gratifying news of the condi
tion of business on the other side of the
mountains. It i?, he says, ; very much
brighter than it was a few weeks ago.
Confidence is being rapidly restored.
Many factories, hitherto idle, are starting,
end everybody feels that from this time
on times will get steadily better. <
Besides this the Eastern people are
looking to California ". for their winter va
cations. A good many are coming- into
Southern California now, and later on he
believes they will come in large numbers.
The train on which he came, and which
arrived here at 12:45 p. "m. yesterday,
brought about forty through passengers,
and left many at ' Pasadena, Los Angeles
and other points. Some of the passengers
were gome"- to San Diego to spend a por
tion of the winter.
v , There is a bright outlook, so Mr. Gold
berg thinks, for lively times on the Pa
cific Coast. The stirring times may not
instantly come, but' the : improvement
promises to be constant and substantial. â¢

FELL FROM A HAYLOFT.
Adam Zimmerman Sleeta His Death
After a Long liebaucb.
The body of Adam Zimmerman was re
moved to the Morgue from the City and
County Hospital, where he died early in
the morning from the effects of a fall from
a hayloft. He was formerly a laborer in
the Richmond Dairy on the Point Lobos
road, but was dismissed because of his
fondness for drink.
The man wouid not keep away from the
premises, but would return and beg for
money, and frequently he slept in the
â¢barn.
On the night of October 20 Zimmerman
got 25 cents from one of the men and later
went to sleep in the hayloft. In the morn
ing he was found in an unconscious con
dition on t.e iloor. A broken Harness
rack showed that he had fallen from the
top of the hayloft. He was sent to the
City and County Hospital, where it was
found that his brain had been injured.
He san k rapidly until the time of his
death. Zimmerman was a German, 45
years of age.

CAN-NED FRUITS AND SALMOIf.
Both Markets Are Firm With a Satis
factory Business.
The circular of the Cutting Packing Company
says:
CANNED FRUlTSâ Apricots âNo especial
movement beyond the diminution of stocks con
sequent upon filling contracts. There is doubtless
a very small stock of extras in first hands, while
there are no more standards than will naturally be
absorbed by the distributive trade between now
and another packing season. At the . same time
the general trade appears to have slacked off dur
ing late years, so that' the total consumptive de
mand has not Increased. We are not prepared to
give a specific leason for this, and conclude it Is
oie of the conditions arising from time to time,
whereby the irade for an established article les
sens without apparent cause. The tendency, how
ever, lias been of late years toward standards and
seconds rather than extra*, which naturally would
iv- u 1 111 a les3-ned demnnd if the quality was con
sidered, because the goods are not only a luxury
tut a novelty, and go among a clans of consumers
who expect something above the quality that Is
now beini; largely furnished. . ,
Peabsâ Stock of extras reduced to very small
qiiamlt â  in iirst band?, while seconds are well
cleaned up and only a fair stock of standards are
Kit "to carry the trade tlirouch until another pack
ing season. We loo i for au^early advance for ail
three grades.
Prachksâ A considerable advance has taken
place In lemon dines of nil qualities and the slock
is rrncticaily cleaned up: at the same time there
is only a fair slock of frees left In first hands;
probably barely enough to supply legitimate
wants of the coast, asi.le from any large demand
tlmt might spring up from l c Last. The market
for the entire line is firm, with a strong tendency
to advance.
Plumbâ the pack has been repeatedly deter
mined one of the shortest for many years, what
stock Is left, which is somewhat uncertain, al
though It cannot be large, will go out at full fig
ures: some parcels thai were carried over from
1895 aie douutless still undistributed, but not to a
sufficient extent 10 hffect the market generally. j
Tomatoes â Packing ceased about ten days a*o,
except by some packers who have not quite, filled
their contracts. The pack has doubtless been be
low the quantity actually lcquired to- carry the
coast and Territories tii ouch until next packing
season, un account of the <-ar)y rains and late .
frosts the crop ripened very slowly and imper
fectly, and the entire pack during the past three
weeKs nas been unsatisfactory. Most of the
packers closed up by the 15tn of October, and
their pacK in cousequence will be of a superior
quality to that produced during the past three
weeks.
Taken altozethei we do not think there Is more
than enough to so round and supply all demands,
miJ we consequently look for an advance. in addi
tion to that already experienced from 57 Va to
6- 1 â¢. at which latter price, entire surplus would
countless be quickly taken up.
Svall Fbuitsâ A fair distributive trade for all
varieties and the small stock in first hands Is being
rapidly ceaned up ai advanced prices.
Salmonâ he marke: is strong and advancing.
There is no stock of any consequence now left In
first hands, and sellers are . holding prices In ac
cordance with the demand lor the brand which
they hold. Prices for red Alaska range from $1 05
to $1 l.>, pink W."> cents to SI 05, silver 85 cen.s to
90 cents, according to brand. Columbia River is
strong at the opening prices, no advances having
been noted ; the demand is now running to the
cheaper grades, and from present indications we
look ior higher prices early in the new year.

Fry?. TORK.N. v.. ; Nov. 12 Early trading
at the Stock Exchange was characterized by weak,
ness, and under free sales the leading issues re
covered l@i Vg per cent, while Manhattan dropped
14 per cent. The selling was caused by sensa
tional rumors from Washington in "regard to
Cuban affairs. It having bee.i Intimated that a war
with Spain was on the cards. ..When the sellinc
'abated the market drifted Into dullness and specu-
Ihi*l in ruled quiet until the last half hour when the
market developed renewed . strength. '.The td
vÂ»nce in prices was xccnmpanled by greater ac
tivity, showing clearly that the disposition is to
trmle on the bull side of the account. . - ... â . â 
The improvement was the result of semi-official
advices from Washington and Madrid which .set :it
rest, at least so Jar as stock open ors are concerne 1,
the disturbing reports clrcnlated during the morn
session of a war with .Spain. American spirits,
common and preferred, led the Hit i 1 point of ac
tivity and advance, the common rising from 11%
to 1 33 "g." g . and the preferred from 28% to 32. B These
siocks reached their highest figures after the an

rprCAHO. It-t..' Nov. 13 â The tone of wheat
to-day was stronger than yesterday, but the I
amount of business transacted during the early
hours was only fair, and in fact seemed sma 1 by
comparison with the average day's dealings of the
past two months. The Liverpool cables Imparted
the firmness mentioned simply by (heir failure to
show any retrogression. Receipts were light, Chi
cago having but 49 cars. The North received
â¢ j. cars against 849 on' last Thursday and 1104 a
year ago. Local inspections lrom store were 21,
-600 bushels. 'Ihe Cincinnati' Price 'Current re

Residents of an Ala

Bell-Ringing and Knocking Con

Played.
THE SCENE OF A SUICIDE
Recorder St. Sure Refus d an. Invita
â¢â¢ tion to Hear the Uncanny
Visitor.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 12.â The house
at 1158 Park avenue is said to be haunted,
and the wraith, or whatever it is that is
responsible lor the uncanny noises, only
appears when the occupants of the house
are plas'ing csrds.
Mr. and Mrs. Broderick, C. H. Paxton
and K. H. Nauiuan all bear testimony to
the strange circumstances that have led
them to swear off playing cards.
Mr. and Mrs. Ahonso Green formerly
owned and lived in the place. S:ie was of
a religious turn of mind and abhorred
cards. Her husoand and niece often en
joyed a quiet game. She could not pre
vent this denlemeni of her home. Other
things led to ni re trouble, and finally she
took a doie of poison aDout live years ago
â  and ended her liie. She di uin the hell
way, saying that she was one too many
for the uoine.
Green moved to Oakland and killed
himself a year .ater and lelt the properly
to the two children, He. en and Bert
Green. The latt-r has ju^t come into ihe
property by reaching his majority.
Tiae house has had many tenants, but
none stayed in it long. It got the name
of being haunted, but nothing definite
was knowu until Mr. and Mrs. Broder.ck
moved in. Nothing unusual happened
until they gave a card party. Eariy the
next morning the uourbeil rang. On
being answered no one was in sight. This
caused some talk, but no; until tne follow
ing week was anything serious thought of
' it. Another whist game wa? p.ayed, and
about 10 o'clock, when the was
nearly completed, knocss as ot knuckles
Upon the swinÂ».iiig-doors between the
dining-room and kitchen were heard.
Upon investigation no one couid be
found. The whole party heard it, and
were somewhat startled to fiud no one in
the kitchen. While taikine auout it the
Knocking was repealed. It continued for
some minutes. Ail were Lad.y inguiened
and the game was discontinued. Tuen
the electric doorbell began to ring. I;
was a lou<j ring, a s it some one was uo.d
. ing tue oution. A.I efforts to locate t.ie
cnuse proved lruitless.
A week later another party was ar
ranged and all arrangements were made
to eaten any one footing around t.,e house.
Thr basement was securely 1-jcked. After
the uttine had {iro^ri-ssed .-ome time the
â¢ knocking and ringing began. The young
nieii nuiueJ ran out and caiied loudiy for
â¢he p and looked around, but, saw no one.
Even while standing oy the oe.l it kept" 1
ringing. They resumed ti.e game, when
the noises were repealed, with loud nioau
ings. This waa enough for one night aud
they disbanded.
A fourth aigbt was selected and Re
corder St. bure and others were invited.
All were present but the Recorder, who
had no desire to investigate. About 11
o'ciock the periormance was rt-peateu.
Thia was the nnal warning and no cards
have been played there since. Although
they often have a party in the House no
disturbances have been known except
when cards were played. Mr. and Mrs.
Broder.ck are both young people.
"We don't play cards now." she said in
answer to a question to-day, "out we cid
until we were scared out of it. I am not
at all afraid, but as 1 have to be here alone
agooddeal I don't want such uncanny
things to think of. It :s strange, and we
have done everything in our power to
fathom it, but we are as much in the dark
to-day as we were the first time it hap
pened. Mr. Paxton and Mr. Naunian
were living in the hou-e at the time, but
.both have gone now. I guess we'll leave
cards alone, anyhow."
TAX BILLS NOT READY
. The Charter Provides for Too
Many Departments of City
. ' . Government.
The Last Veto W d s Filed So as to
Avoid Any R ady.Made
Replies.
Oakland Office Han Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Nov. 11. f
The di?satis action of the Merchants'
â¢ Exchange with the present city charter of
Oakland will probably result in a change.
The merchants have decided that there
are altogether too many departments in
the city government and that not even a
street improvement can be undertaken ii
â¢ any one branch opposes it.
"The Merchants' Exchange is quite
right about the fO"lish details of our char
' ter," said Mayor Davie to-iiay, "and they
only bear out w; at I have said for the
past two years. Our Board of Works, of
which I am one-third, is a useless and ob
structive body as at present constituted
and should be abolished. It is of no value
to the city, but is an expensive ornament.
This is, nowever, only one of the draw
backs of the charter. The present com
plication over the tax levy is another
proof that something should be done right
away.
"The city taxes will become delinquent
tinder the law in a few day?, and yet the
tax levy for the ti-cal year that com
menced on July 1 is not yet fix^d. The
law declares that after a certain date a
large percentage shall be added, and this
elate will certainly be passed before ail the
.taxes are paid. The amount provided by
"my levy of $1 is ample, as ha* been proved
during the past year. The Council's levy
of $1 10 simply provides a large nind for
themto placo where it can be oi most use
'next spring when the municipal election
comes round. This matter mij;ht well
have been fixed months ago.
".Some members of the Council have
Btatea that I s oul'i have'tiled my veto
earlier, but I have a Â»:ood reason lor not
' doing so. On former occasions when I
have sent messa.es to the Council they
have been opened before that body met,
and as soon as they have been read in the
Council chamber, long typewritten, in
sulting messages have been read in reply.
I intended that this should not be the
case this time, and called a special meet
ing to receive my message, which I have a
perfect right to do."
The present city government goes out of
office next March and the Mayor declares
that there is no need whatever of a "gen
eral fund" which enn be voted away by
$499 resolutions which dispense with the
formality of requiring his assent.
On the Tax Collector's door is the iol
lowing notice:
TAX BILLS NOT READY.
KO LEVY YET MADE.
Hundreds of propertv-ownera who do
not understand politics, but who are
anxious to avoid any delinquent taxes,
have visited the Treasurer's office daily,
but seeing the noti'.e they walk away and
wonder.
WANTS HIS FEES.
The Bacon Kftato Now Beady for Dis
tribution.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 12.â Attorney
F. A. Berlin, who has represented the ex
ecutor and executrices of the estate of
Henry D. Bacon, has given notice that
he will ask to have his fees fixed next
Monday by the court. He has filed thirty
two pages of typewritten copy, showing
tne services rendered, with items by da es
of consultations and of proceedings taken.
He says for the first two years the greater
part of his time was required with the
estate, and during three and a half years
his services were almost continually re
quired.
" The estato was appraised at $888,633 75
and money has been collected sinct- ag.re
catinc $388,875, muk ni! no total value of
the estate $1,226,903 75. The commis
sion of the executor and executrices. as
provided by law, would amount to $14,089.
To keep the e.-tate intact the heirs mc r
porated under the title of the Bacon Land
and Loan Company and conveyed ah their
interests to thai company. The widow
has had a monthly income of $800 from
February 19, 18y3, to October 19, 1896,
amounting u> $o5 200. i
Nye's Experience.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 12.â The candi
dates for office at the recent election are
now tiiing their campaign expense ac
count m required by th<- purity of election
Jaw. One of tlie best presented to date is
that ol tx-Judue Stephen G. Nye, who ran
as the Prohibition candidate ior Superior
Judge and received 1091 votes, wliiie the
nnrty Presidential electors received only
130. Dnder the statement of expenditures
the Ju'ige says:
"I attended two political meetings dur
ing the cam t'aign preccd in r the election.
One, the Prohibition meeting, was opened
with prayer. The other, a Republican
meeting, whs opened with a corkscrew.
I contribued 50 cents to the former to pay
the gas bill, and $5 to the latter to aid in
dressing in uniform the Young Men's Re
publican League; at least the money was
obtained from me on that pretence; to
whom paid I don't know. Other than
these, with me, it was not a money cam
paign."
Clipped anil Indexed.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Nov. 12.â Librarian
Peterson of the Public Library in his re
port to the Trustees, among other things
says:
The clipping of newspapers is another in
novÃtion; we ure c.iji;-inÂ« articles from our
dally papersâ that Is, the Oakland and San
Fraiifl.iro dailies. Departments have been
established such, as "Board of Trade." "Mer
chants' Exchange," "City Council," "Boar.l of
Educaiiuu," and others of local interest. Tlie
reports ol meetings will bo reguUrly clipped
and properly arranged ready ior reference.
Tuis, I be'ieve, will b_> a very 'imerosting and 1
valuable d partmi-nt of the library. Many of
thc~e art cies may never be in book form, or
accessible, consequently cannot help but be
valuable for reference.
He Was Shocked.
During a tire last night Foreman Isaac
Foster of Engine Company No. 1 went to
the roof of the buiiditif: with n bucket of
water to dash on the flames. The fire was
caused by a line of electric wire, and when
tlie water touched it the current was com
municated to Foster. Ha received a se
vere shock and was thrown against a
chimney, thus preventing him from a fall
of fifty ie t to the ground. He soon re
covered and feels no 'oad effects from the
experience.
Policemen's Uniforms.
Chief of Police Lloyd has recommended
to the Police and Fire Commissioners that
all of the cloth for police uniforms pass
through the hands of the department and
that if it is not of required shade or weight
it can be reacted. The Plan is the
as has worked satisfactorily in San Fran
cisco. He favors the adoption of Ameri
can made goods instead ot the French
beaver now used, as it would be cheap, r
and more uniform in color.

OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 12.â A com
plaint wis filed in the Superior Court to

incompatibility of temper and there will
be no contest.

EBELL LADIES
ON ILLUSTRATING
Club Women Start a Fight
Against Publishing
Pictures.
A True Woman's Photograph
Shou d Be Reserved for the
Family Album.
READY FOR THE OPENING.
Newspaper M n Pledged Not to Make
Sketches at Public
Meetings.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 12. j
Two of the leading ladies of the Ebell
Society, Oakland's fashionable literary
club, have inaugurated an idea that will
probably become common among the
members.
Interior and Exterior V.cws of the E:e 1 l Scc'ct/'s New Chbhcuse.
Mrs. Bunnell, the president of the so
ciety, and Mrs. H. O. Trowbridee, cnair
man of the building committee (wbich
has just brouKlit the result of its labors
to a successful conclusion), have decided
that ladies ia private life are not honored
by beinp pictured in the public papers
and have expressed their disapproval of
of such illustrations.
For two years Mrs. H. O. Trowbridge
has been before the public in a semi
official capacity. To her, more than to
any other woman, belongs tne credit of
originating the "home production" move
ment in Oakland that gave birta to the
annual exposition. Mrs. Trowbridge last
Christmas personally supervised and ar
ranced the daily entertainments that were
one of the moat successful features of the
show.
During all this time Mr?. Trowbridge
has steadfastly refused to allow her photo
graph to be reproduced in a newspaper.
On one occasion she met several newspa
perman at the Tabernacle, and in response
to the usual request she set forth her views
very clearly.
"I am a home woman," she said, "and
of my home my picture is a part. luo
not wish every person that picks up v
newspaper to hay- the privilege of gazing
at mft and making remarks it they see fit.
My work is solely of a private nature,
although it brings me somewhat before
the public. Of course I know thai there
are numerous opportunities at meetings
and elsewhere where sketches could be
made, but I hope that my wishes in the
matter will be respected."
MrÂ». Trowbridge has been very active in
promoting the new building, but so far
her womanly request has not been re
fused.
Mrs. G. W. Bunnell holds the same
views as Mrs. Trowbridge. "I do not
wish to figure prominently," she Eaid,
"and I think there is an indication among
ladies to value their pictures too lightly.
Of course we like to have nicely illustrated
articles in our newspapers, but there is
our building â a beautiiul thinv that will
last â matte some pictures of it and let
I c world sco wtiat a Handsome home the
Ebell Society has. The president is al
ways cnaneing, and I do not approve of
unwarranted notoriety."
Saturday evening the Ebell Clubhouse
will be thrown open add an invitational
reception will be given. There will be no
formal exercises, but an orchestra will be
present. â¢
The reception committee consists of
Mr.-. Paul Lohse, chairman; Mrs. T. C.
Cooean, Mrs. G. L. Nusbaumer, Mrs. C. D.
Pierce, Mrs. E. B. Jerome, Mrs. Beth
Mann, Mrs. E. Nusbaumer, Mrs. W. H.

Cornwall, Mrs. Wallace Ever6on, Mrs.
George L. Curtiss, Mrs. W. E. Sharon,
Mrs. Gordon M. Stolp, Mrs. Lv W. Car
tiss. The assistant reception committee
is composed of Miss Georpia Strone, chair
man; Miss Eva Lnkens, Miss E. Drussell,
Miss Grace Musser, Miss Mabel Gray, Miss
Mona Crellin, Miss Laura Crellin, Miss
Mabel Gelette, Mi*s Grace Burrill.
OAKLAND'S TAX LEVY
They PagÂ§ the Agreed Kate Over the
Recent Veto Placed by the Mayor
Upon It.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 12.â The City
Council met to-night to consider the veto
of the Mayor on the latest tax levy sent to
him. When a motion was made to pass
it over the veto it prevailed by a vote of 9
to 2. Kaufman and Bassett voted "no."
On former occasions Brosnahan and
Watkinson have voted with the Mayor,
making a vote of 7 to 4. As eight votes
are required to pass over a veto the meas
ures have been defeated till this evening.
This ordinance fixes the levy at $1 10,
which it 10 cents more than last year,
when the City government was run with
out a deficit.
lietter Fire Protection.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Nov. 12â The present
fiscal year is expected to bring a number

truck company. Chief Fair has hopes of
securing a large modern truck for East
Oakiand durinir the year, in which event
the small one in use there will be taken to
the building on Broadway. The Chief has
just had made a new "Siamese" coupline
to enable him to concentrate the streams
of several uifferent engines on one line of
hose, so ns to obtain a stream of great
force, and in case ot a very hot rire to pour
a great quantity of water into it with
some effect.

.BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 12.â The stn
dents of tho State University will yell at
the Thanksgiving football game, which
will take place just two weeKs from to
day, as they never yelled before. They
have commenced to train in "rooting,'''
and every evening during football prac
tice they will congregate on the grand
stand and train their throats and lungs
in giving forth their slogans of war. A
meeting of the student body was called
to-day in the big auditorium tent for the
express purpose of stirring up enthusiasm
over the coming game and of organizing
for systematic cheering. All classes were
excused for the hour of meeting, and the
bic tent was crowded to the entrance. A
dozen or more speeches were made by
various representative m^n of the uni
versity on the subject of encouraging the
football players in their work Irom now
till the great contest.
This, they paid, could be dono in vari
ous ways, but the mosi potent method
was by loud, earnest, frequent cheering.
The condition of the men at the present
lime and the outlook for the big game
were reviewed. It was unanimously
agreed that Berkeley's prospects for a vic
tory over the Palo Alto team are much
more encouraging this year than at any
season previous. One of the speakers
said: "We will win this year if we ever
do. We have had too many tie games al
ready, and so it seems inevitable tuat the
balance will be turned this time."
T is favorable outiook si-emed to have
been due to the excellent tv tion received
by the players this year at he hands of
Coachers Butterworth and Nott.
Ye.l-masier Gooding announced that
the nttihuted colleges woul i join this year
in giving the yells at the u-arae, and that
the medicos had already b.gun to practice.
He said also mat a section of the grand
stand to accommodate 500 will be re
served for. Berke ey "routers."

Dr. F. H. Payne is s till in a very critical con

Bctansness huve been but slight, but hopes
are still entertained of his Ultimate recovery.
Fovnd a Child* ,I'nfÃn.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 12.â A child's
coffi i was found in a creek near H.iywards
to- ;ay, and Marshal Ramage made an in
vestigation. All scrtsol sensational stories
were being circulatt-d, but it v;aa found
that an undertaker had thrown the casket
away because moths had ruined the trim
mings.
Clumgetl the Text.
"I have a very critical parishioner in my
church, who used to annoy me terribly,
t.u: I have finally silenced him," said a
Harlem preacher, very confidentially, to a
br 'ther minister, who thought the story
too good to keep. "I used to be a;raid of
him. If I ever preached a sermon the sec
ond time he vnis sure to call at the pars<>n
au* on Monday and tell me just when
I preached it befure. I thought that man
had a most prodigious memory, unui a
few months ago, when I called at his
house one i-vening and waited in the par
lor alone for a few minutes. I opened his
Bible and turning the pa^es not:ced that
he had the date ut every one of my ser
mons no:ed pn the margin opposite its
text. S me that have heen preached two
or three times were marked accordingly.
"1 had found his memory and v-ry
easily defeated it. Since then when I
want to repeat a sermon I simp!y se ect a
new text that will fit it instead of the
ori-ina! one. I have repeated a number
of sermons since I made my discoveiy,
and haven't card a single word aboiu
them from my cri ical and watcnful
friend." â New York Herald.

ANOTHER DAY
FOR FAVORITES
The Bookmakers Are Not
in Clover at Ingleside
Track.
Bvinbazette Was Extensively
Played, but Finished
Behind Peril.
SUMMERTIME WON EASILY.
Geyser Carried the Corrigan Co'ors in
Frontâ Hermanita and Reddington
Headed Their Fields Out.
Owners and jockeys are beginning to
find out that acrobatic performances will
not be tolerated by the otlicials at Ingle
side, and in consequence the horses are
running up to form. The books a** well j
as the combination stand received another
jevere shaking up yesterday, the best ani
mal in nearly every race being on its best
behavior. Four out of five first choices
headed their fields past the wire, and at
the conclusion of the sport a strong |
draur ht of wind would have blown many j
of the bookies' coin-sacks away. The cli
matic conditions were perfect, the weather
being clear and warm, and the attendance
was large.
The track, although in good condition,
was slow; the turns still showing traces oi
the recent rains. H. Martin, who now
looms up as a very promising rider, landed
two of the winners and wa<Â» placed once.
Mr. Sink's mare, Sister Mary, was at
first installed a 6 to 5 favorite for the
opening seven-furlong run. with Summer
time next in demand at 8 to 5. Before
the horses came out, the betting switched,
and the latter mare ruled favorite. It
proved a very easy win Tor Summertime,
who shook the Friar off on the far turn
and won in romping fashion, with Sister
Mary taking the place from Instigator
just about as easily.
Ed Corri.an's recent purchase. Geyser,
downed the five two-year-olds opposed to
him in the six-furlong dash like smashing
eges with a baseball bat. A prohibitive 3
to 10 choice, he lei almost from the jump,
and won pulling up from Grandezia.
In the third event, over seven lurlongs,
occurred the only dump ot the day. Daggie
fcmiih started a mare named Bombazette,
and the bookmakers were almost knocked
off their blocks taking the coin that went
in on her, forcine the odds from 7 to 5
down to 7to 10. Peril, the second choice,
ridden by T. Murphy, opened up such a
gap of daylight that the "good thing"
could never get ud, and was beaten away
off, finishing a distant second. Nabopolos
ser took the show.
Herinanita, also trained by Doggie
Smith, lo ked to have struck a very soft
spot in the mile and a sixteenth event, de
cided under selling conditions, and 4 to 5
was eagerly grabbed up. Martin rated
along in third position with tbe mare to
the head of the stretch, where be came
away and won with pounds to spare from
Navy Blue. Marcel was a good third.
The early bird* haJ their lingers
scorched in the betting on the final race
on tbe card, a six and a half furiong af
fair.
Kamsin and Kecidington both opened
up Bto 5 chances. The early money went
in on Kamsin, cutting his price to G to 5.
Later the paddocK coin came along on
Keddington who was backed down to 6<o
5, while Kamsin receded in the betting to
9 to 5.
Reildington, with Alvarado in close at
tendance, led the other four starters into
tbe stretch, where the former began draw
ing away and parsed the stand two lengths
in the lead. Kamsin was an indifferent
third.
Notes.
FranK Brown, who was out here last
winter with E. H. Shirley, a very ordi
nary selling plater, arrived at Oakland
track yesterday with a string of ten
horses.
W. B. Casey, the steeplechase rider who
tried his pugilistic abilities on two Pink
rrton men on Tnesday, was fined $30 by
the steward and his bad^e was ordered
taken uj> until the tint is paid. "*
Snowdown ran away a mile yesterday
morning :v:th Steeplechase Jockey May
nard in the saddle and pulled up very
lame.
It was rumored around the track yester
day that Ed Purser wouid like to see tbe
sweet little Midlothian filly Tea Rose rac
ing in his colors anu that he had offered

PREPARING FOR ACTION.
Arrests of Dealers in Adulter
ated Food Products Will
Be Mad?.
The Board of Health Has Been Gath
ering Evidence for Some Tims
Past.
The Board of Health has about com
pleted its list of the dealers who sell
canned goods that have been found to be
adulterated, and will shortly begin swear
ing out warrants for those who have vio
lated the law.
The larger portion of the goods that
have fallen under the ban of the depart
ment is of Eastern origin, and lsador Ja
cobs, who is connected with a local con
cern, has interested himself greatly in
collecting statistics and evidence regard
ing the adulterated Eastern goods.
Though :iot publicly connected with tbe
Health Department, he ha" been entrusted
with the important task of gathering sam
ples of the goods and it is said that he has
a list of 1300 dealers who are selling adul
terated food stuffs.
Among the articles that nave been
closely investigated is honey. Much of
the alleged product of the industry of the
bees is said to be glucose, and it is ex
pected that the first arrests will be among
those -who sell the stuff with honey labels
on tbe bottles. The analysis made by
I'rofessor Wenzell show that in many
cases tbe bottles only contain 10 per cent
of honey, and in few cases does it run
over 50 per cent.
The warrants for the arrests of the sell
ers of adulterated honey will all be servea
in one day, and arrangements have been
made with the police courts to handle the
caves as rapidly as posÂ«r. ble.
It is Known that ihe dealer* in canned
goods will fight the matter to a bitter end,
but the Health Department has confi
dence in the laws that have been passed
to protect the genuine goods, and it be
lieves that convictions will follow the
arrests.
In case flaws are found In the laws pre
parations will at once be made to have the
next Legislature amend them so as to
make them serviceable.
COUNTING CAREFULLY.
Election Commissioners Reach the
Thiity-Xiuth Assembly District.
As usual the official count of the ballots
progressed slowly yesterday, because the
customary numberof tally-sheeta and poll
lists were found unsigned, and the Com
missioners had to halt and direct that
Clerk Sweeny issue citations to the de
linquents to appear and do what they
should have done when their count was
finished.
More than usual care was taken yester
day in going throueh the precincts of the
Thirty-ninth A^embly District, which
forms a portion of the Twenty-third Sena
torial DiÂ«trict. This is ilie district in
which Alepsis. Hall, Tyrrell and Welch
were but a few votes apart, and in which
a recount is anticipated. Nothing un
usual was discovered.
The Siamese, as a claÂ«Â«, are not over
ambitious in trade, and the greater part
of the small retail establishments and
various kinds of shops are in the bands of
the Chinese. The latter also furnish the
labor of the country.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1896.
CHANGED FROM
SILVER TO GOLD
Manager Arnold of Cripple
Creek on the Demand
for Auriferous Leads.
All the Gold Camps of the West
Now Likely to Grow
Lively.
CEIPPLE CREEK STOCKS RISF.
The Camp Rebuilt With Brick, About
18.000 People There and Others
Coming Daily.
E. 8. Arnold, manager of the Abe Lin
coln gold mine at Cripple Creek, is at the
Grand. He has just come from Pearl,
Idaho, a new gold camp on a tributary of
the Snake, near Boise. Mr. Arnold says
times are pretty good at Cripple Creek.
His mine, the Abe Lincoln, is at the foot
of thÂ« Gold and Globe hills. It is a com
paratively new property, only a few
months ago having become a paying mine.
"In Colorado now there is a good deal
better feeling in regard to gold mining,"
said Mr. Arnold. "Of course it is settled
that there can be no new development of
silver mines, and the result is that a great
many people are giving renewed attention
to go.d.
"Since the election a good deal of East
ern money is beginning to come to Colo
rado for investment. For some months
previous the capitalists said they wouldn't
do anything till they saw How things came
out. Now that it is ended the} say they
are satistied and are investing.
"In addition to this all the good mining
stocks on the different boards at Denver,
Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek have
advanced wonderfully. This is another
thing that shows the increased interest.
All over the State wh?re there are good
m:nes there will be development.
"Besides this or.r wealthiest mine
owners will invest in California gold
mines and in other gold properties in the
West. A number ot our mining men are
already looking at mines here.
"Cripple Creek is now thoroughly re
built, most of the buildings being brick.
There are from 18.000 to I*o,ooo people in
tbe town, but in the district there must be
fully 30,000. Quite a number of men who
hope to make a strike, and others who
want to go in business, are coming into
the district.
"During tne last four months at Cripple
Creek there has been greater development
than at any other period. Many prospects
have become paying mines. The interest
in pold mining has increased wonderfully.
"I think the closing of silver mines for
at least four years will tend to develop
gold mines all over the country. The
miners can't be idle. They must do some
thing. Therefore, I think that it is in
gold mining ti.at we are to see great ac
tivity.
"The increased interest is seen all over
the country. I have ju3t come from Pearl,
Idaho, a new and very promising gold dis
trict about fifty miles southwest of Boise.
A good many people are rushing into that
district."
Mr. Arnold will be in the City fora week
or two, and possibly longer. He is here
in connection with business in his line.

OLD SUPERVISORS
WANT TO TARRY
Preparing to Test Their
Tenure of Official
Life.
They Are Hoping to Hold on Two
Years More as County
Officers.
ASHWOETH MAY JOIN IN,
And an Issue Will Ec Raised in the
Supreme Court of Great Impor
tance to Citizens.
The old Board of Supervisors does not
propose to get out of office without first
testing the tenure of their oflicial life in
a legal war. This information comes from
a source which leaves no room for ques
tion concerning its accuracy. The news
was at first doubted, but it was confirmed
late last night. The facts concerning the
Kahn against Sutro suit before the Su
preme Court are so fresh in the mind that
it is not necessary to more than briefly
recapitulate. The Supreme Court de
cided, and this consideration is the essen
tial one in the present instance, thai the
officers who administer the executive de
partments of the City and County ot San
Francisco are in two classes. One class is
made up of county officers and the other
class, under the terms of the decision
quoted, were ascertained by the Supreme
Court to be only municipal or city officers.
Those in the class of county officers
were iound by the fcupreme Court to be
entitled, under the county government
act, to hold on two years longer in office.
The officers so classed are well known.
]S"o\v it has recently occurred to some
members of the present Board of Super
visors that they are county officers.
Whether they were so considered by the
Supreme Court, or whether their point
â¢was taken into account at ail by the
Justices, doe 3 not appear ironi the word
ing of the decision, which is entirely
si-em in that regard.
But when the suggestion took hold that
Supervisors are county officers, and that
they may be as well entitled to hold over
as the other officiuls who have been
specifically designated by the Supreme
Court, the idea was so taking that it at
once secured a strong and lasting grip on
the minds of certain of the present board.
The prospect of legally holding office two
years more was surely alluring.
The success of the scheme may have
been thought to partly depend upon the
degree of secrecy which was attendant
upon the taking of the initial steps. Con
ferences have been held from time to time
daring the past, two weeks, at w ich
learned counsel has been present. Who
the lawyer is who has principally figured
as legal adviser to the Supervisors has not
been made public, but a hint was thrown
out last night that General Dickinson
might be the man.
Supervisor Benjamin said last evening
that he bad heard the talk about holding
on. He understood aiso that Superin
tendent of Streets Ashworth was
going to see whether the law does not
entrench him in a legally impenetrable
position for two 3'ears more. Mr. Benja
min has been conlined to his home some
days, but he knew of the talk before he
â went home. He said that if the others go
in together to test their legal rights and
legal standing he would co-operate with
them.
A close friend of Supervisor Wagner
said last evening he had heard that all
the Supervisors, or nearly all, were of the
opinion that under the Kahn against Sutro
decision they were stricily in it, and they
have secured legal advice that their atti
tude is entirely correct. The matter is
common talk among them. This proposed
move of the present Supervisors wnl proba
bly be a source of astonishment to the
newly elected board, who were peacefully
banqueted a few nights ago by Mayor
eled Phelan, their calling and election
then being supposed by them and also by
the very great majority of the citizens of
San Francisco to be sure beyond cavil or
question. The secret projection of such a
leading issue comes with the suddenness
and some of the surprising effect of a
bombshell of the political sort.
Whatever the result may be the move
ment points out once more the singular
snarl in the official affairs of the City and
County wljicii has been occasioned
by the opinion and decision of the Su
preme Court recently. The news was ob
tained too late last night to make it pos
sible to interview many persons.
Some of the present Supervisors were
out when Call reporters sought to find
them at their places of business or homes
T;ie idea was prevalent that they did not
wish to be questioned at this time, for
tb^y have not their plans fully made.
One who should know said that they
had been advised that there are several
claims which they may advocate with a
show of success. Tne news is sure to
occasion a sensation. The existing official
situation is entirely unique. The Supreme
Court changed the old-time understand
ing concerning the legal position of
officials who In the City and County of
San Francisco were heretofore considered
to be in one cla&Â«. New complications are
possible if the old Supervisors succeed.
THE BOY BEATER.
Charles Peterson, the Sailor, Ordered
Into Custody and His Bonds Con
siderably Increased.
Charles Peterson, tlie Bailor who bru
tally beat his stepson, Frank Augsberger,
Sunday nieht with a rope's end and was
arrested Wednesday for cruelty to chil
dren and battery, failed to appear when
his case was called in Judge Joachimsen's
court yesterday morning. He had been
released on $300 bonds, Attorneys Frey
and Becsey being vis sureties, and the
Judge declared the bonds forfeited and
ordered a bench warrant issued for Peter
tson's arrest.
Shortly afterward Peterson appeared
in court with his wife. Both were
drunk. Peterson was immediately ar
rested and taken to the City Prison, and
the Judge, who had seen the boy's condi
tion, incrtaseu his bonds to $1000 on each
charge.
Mrs. Peterson was also arrested on the
charge of drunkenness. She presented a
repulsive sight. Botn her eyes were black
and swollen and her face was covered
with contusions from her husband's
blows.
Policeman T. J. Coleman, who bad
charge ol the boy, took him again to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Weil
dressed his left eye. There is a possibility
that the boy may lo c c the sight of his eye.
He is being cared for at the Youths' Di
rectory.
The Pacific Coast Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children will see to
it that Peterson is vigorously prosecuted
for his brutality.
Keturued for the Winter.
Colonel W. P. Harrington and John Boggs,
both of Colusa. arrived here yesterday, accom
panied by their families, and have taken
apartments at the Palace for the winter. They
have been absent from the City, staying at
tlieir homes iv Colu&a County, lor a long time.
The Above Sketch Gives a View of the Northern Portion of the Bay as It Appeared Yesterday. The American Ship Francis Is Shown in the Fore Part of the Picture
With Her Flag at Half Mast on Account of the Death of Captain Smith's Wife.
AN INFLUX OF
WHEAT VESSELS
Over Two Dozen of Them
Arrived in Port
Yesterday.
Some Are Chartered "lo Arrive,"
but Others Are Here on
"Spec."
SEVERAL IN THE FAIRWAY.
The Monowai and Rio de Janeiro
Will Have a Race to Hono
lulu.
Never since the days of '49 has the har
bor been so crowded as it is at present.
All classes of vessels are here, and seven
out of every ten are seeking a charter.
Many of them are in ballast, ana some
have brought coal from Australia for a
nominal sura in order to make expenses.
All the captains are excited over the ad
vance in wheat, and some of the new ar
rivals are holding out for a 35-shilling rate
to "Cork for orders."
A few days ago the disengaged ton
nage in port aggregated 68,535 tons, while
in 1895 it was only 27,664 tons. At the
same time the engaged tonnage was 103,
-828, while in '95 it was only 92,415. Since
the above figures were made up quite a
number of vessels from foreign ports have
arrived, and in consequence the disen
gaged list has been largely increased.
Among the vessels lying In the stream
is the American ship Francis. Early in
the morning the tug Alert went-out to her
and brought ashore a funeral party. Cap
tain Smith's wife died when twelve days
from port and he brought the remains
here for interment. The American vessel
stood up among the forty or lif iv British
er;, the only one that Mew the stars and
stripes, and it was at Half mast. When
the tug landed the mourners the remains
were at once taken to Laurel Hill, where
the inierment took place.
Several of the vessels that got in an
chored in the fairway, and Assistant
Chief Wharfinger Scott was kept busy or
dering them to move. The Alcinous got
in last nigh; and nas been on the move
ever since. The captain would not accept
the services of a tug, and sailed up the
bay from Meiggs wharf. In the first
place he had anchored right in the way of
the Tiburon and Sausalito ferry-boats,
and on the second occasion he was in the
fairway of the Oakland Creek boats. A
second warning was given and Captain
McCormaig had to again hoist up his an
chor and move on.
The ship is now well up in Mission Bay
and out of harm's way. The lnverneill
and the Pierre Corneiile were also in the
fairway, and M.-. Scott went out on the
Governor Irwin and ordered them to
move this morning. The Larnaca, which
was in collision with the Pierre Corneiile,
was also in the fairway, but was moved
last evening.
The Lancing, which started ior the gas
works and ran on a mud bank, will be
hauled off and docked at Fremont-street
wharf to-day. There was considerable
trouble in finding a berth for her, as she
occupies the space usually assigned to two
ships. Her cargo of coal will be dis
charged into scows and lightered to its
destination.
The water-front thieves are still at work.
Their ingenuity is remarkable. While
they can steal a 200-pound bell from a
ship, they are also equal to rifling a
nickel-in-the-s!ot machine. Yesterday
two of them went into the Dundon Tim
ber-preserving Company's office and got
away with about $6 in nickels. One of
them bad a coil of wire in hs hand and
the other had a' bag of â  tools. They told
Dundon that bis telephone was out of
order and that they were going to fix it.
They did fix it, and at the same time got
away with a week's collections. Several
other nickel-in-the-slot telephones along
the front were also tapped, and now the
police are looking for the thieves.
The whaling bark Cape Horn Pigeon is
having a new mainmast put in, and the
California will go on the drydock. As
soon as the repjirs on the two vessels are
completed they will sail for the southern
seas after the sperm whale*. The Pigeon
i-i the most successful all-round wnalcr
iifloHt, and her captain expects to make a
big catch next season.
The new boilers for the Spreckels col
lier Czarina were put in yesterday. When
in position and the machinery keyed up
the vessel will te one of the best of her
class on the coa-t. She will carry Beaver
Hill coal to this port, and then there will
be a chance o! supplying the demand for
that class of coal. At present the bunkers
are empty half the lime. The Czarina
will have her trial about the first week in
December.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Monowai and the Pacific Mail Company's
Rio de Janeiro both sailed for Hon
olulu yesterday. The Monowai is en
route for Sydney, N. S. W. t via Honolulu,
Apia and Auckland, and the Kio lor
Hongkong via Honolulu and Yoko
hama. Chief Engineer McCnig of the
Monowai says thai with the "retards" now
in use in the boilers he can brat the Rio
into Honolulu twelve hours. The Pacific
Mail people laugh at the idea, so the out
come of tne run will be looked for with
much interest. The passengers on the
Monowai are:

The Rio took away very few passengers
but considerable cargo.
The schooner Berwick, now on the way
to San Francisco, haJ a peculiar experi
ence in Coquille Kiver. In passing out
Captain Strahan ran her on a sand spit,
and when the tide went out she was hard
and fast. She settled and it was finally
decided that the easiest way out of the
trouble would be to haul the schooner
over the spit into the river. This was
done and the Berwick sailed again for San
Francisco little the worse for her mishap.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day and instructed Superintendent of Re
pairs Patterson to inspect the water front,
and anywhere he found a hole in a wharf
to put a fence around it and also a light
on the fence at night. After doing so he
will report to the board, and then it will
be seen whether the City or the State is
liable for the repairs.
An ambulance is to be stationed at the
water front, and the Board of Health
wants the Commissioners to co-operate.
The matter was taken under advisement,
but the chances are that the required fa
cilities will be (:ranted.
There is trouble brewing on the bark
| Mohican, that got in from Honolulu yes
- terday. The men say that Chief Officer
! Murray was too handy with the belaying
i pin, and that the second mate and several
| of the crew still carry marks of his disci
pline. The chances are that the matter
will be aired in the United States courts.
The fleet in the stream was added to last
j night by the arrival of the Cloncaird from
I Newcastle, N. S. W., the Grenada from
I Departure Bay and the Indian Empire
j lrom Callao.
KANE WAS IN THE WAY.
Story Explaining Why a Cours
ing Match Did Not
Come Off.
Che Humane Sccisty Seems to Have
Stalled an Exhibition Intend d
lor Another.
There are two stories concerning the
failure to give a sample coursing exhibi
tion at the Presidio athletic grounds last
Sunday for the enlightenment of the di
rectors of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. One story, which
was civen out last Sunday and which was
generally accepted as true, was that no
hares could be procured for the day. The
other story is of a very different sort. Tha
exhibition was arranged to come off, and
the directors were there all right; but
there were others.
Frank J. Kane, secretarj of the Pacific
Society for the Suppression of Vice
(this society also embracing within its
work the prevention of cruelty to ani
mals and the prevention of cruelty to chil
dren) heard in advance of the exhibition.
He had no doubt as to whether the re
sults of coursingâ the tearing of the
hares â was cruelty. He determined to
put a stop to the exhibition, and so went
to the Presidio with the intention of
camping on the athletic grounds all day.
He arrived there about 0 a. m. and re
mained there until about 3p. m. Then he
concluded that the exhibition was off,
and went away. When the events of the
day have since been mentioned Mr. Kane
has acted as if he were amused.
The parties interested in coursing were
not. particularly pleased to see Mr. Kane,
for his intentions had in some wav be
come either known or were guessed at
shrewdly. It will be recollected that
C. B. Holbrook, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal?,
on a previous occasion disapproved of the
coursing of dogs after live hares. Then
pressure was brought to bear upon the di
rectors of the society to witness one exhi
bition, that thej- might make up their
minds from personal observation. Sev
eral directors consented to go. The exhi
bition did not come off.
Mr. Kane says that he did not know
until late in the afternoon that the di
rectrjrn were at the Presidio. Ho had not
seen them and did not see them until,
late in the afternoon, the weatfier having
become threatening, he started to go
away. So the directors did not see any
conrsing match after live hares. The di
rectors may or may not have been sur
prised, but at any" rate the mystery was
explained.

HER STARTLING
MIDNIGHT ERROR
Accidental Melodrama in
Victory Bateman's Bed
Room.
She Mistook Strychnine for an
Opiate and Swallowed a
Dose.
IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE.
Fright as an Emetic and a Timely
Physician Saved the Pretty
Actress* Life.
Miss Victory Bateman went through
her part as DUrothy at the Grand Opera-
MISS VICTORY BATEMAN.
house last evening with an aching head
and a nervous system very mucn un
strung. In fact, the popular little a:tress
was very much inclined to go home to bed
and let "The Minute Men of 1774-75'" worry
along without her, and it was all Decause
a few hours before she did not notice that
a box containing phenacetine and'anothcr
of the same size containing strychnine lay
in a dangerous proximity on the wash
stand in her room when she sought a. done
of medicine for an attack of neuralgia.
About 12 o'clock Wednesday night Miss
Bateman returned to her room at the
Langham, corner of Ellis and Mason
streets, from the theater and soon after
retired. Being unable to sleep from neu
ralgic pains in her head, the arose from
her beu and turning up the light she
started to measure out about ten grains of
phenacatine, the quantity she was in the
habit of taking. This she dropped in her
mouth, immediately washing the powder
down with a little water.
Instantly the intensely bitter taste of
the powder told her she haa taken the
wrong dose. Then she rembered that
some strychnine in an old phenacetine
box had been placed on the stationary
washstand for the purpose of destroying
the tiny water worms.
The dreadful knowledge that she had
taken enough poison to kill several per
sons not accustomed to that diet and the
nauseating flavor of the strychnine made
tier deathly sick, and the vomiting that
ensued saved her life.
A physician was called, who imme
diately took the proper measures to re
move all the poison from her stomach,
and when she was pronounced out of all
dancer she was in an extreme state of
nervous prostration.
When Miss Batemen was interviewed
yesterday afternoon at the Langham by a
Call reporter, she confessed to feeling
somewhat "shaky," but much rejoiced at
her narrow escape.
"It is no use to explain bow I happened
to get the wrong box, or how they hap
pened to be together," said the actress, as
she tossed her aching head around on the
pillow. "It was a dreadful mistake, and
it will not happen again, I assure you. I
kne~ I had taken strychnine just as soon
as I had swallowed it. and i thought 1
was gone. And how glad I was when it
made me sick, for I knew that was my
only salvation.
"Oh, I'll go to the theater and go
through ray role to-night, but I'm afraid
'Dorothy' will make a poor showing, as
i would rntlier stay here in bed all the
eveninr. Please don't say anything about
this, except that it was a mistake. This
is not the kind of notoriety one cares
about."
Then Dorothy, the heroic maid of the
revolution, in the play, wiped her eyes
and feverish brow in real life, and turned
her head away, and tried to remember her
partly forgotten lines in time for the cur
tain call.
LONELY SEA LIFE.
Captain Moore of the I'atterson Tells
How the Gloom Waa Lifted by
Occasional Mail*. -
Captain E. K. Moore of the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey ship
Patterson arrived here yesterday and is at
the Occidental. His ship will go into the
drydock at the foot of Main street to re
ceive some repairs. She will not return to
the Alaska coast, where she has been, till
next spring.
"We were at work off the southeast coast
of Alaska," said Captain Moore last night.
"The ship has beer, up there each season
since ISS4. She was built a year previous.
| Our force has been going right along doing
j regular survey work, gettinp our bearings
j in the first ulace by the stars and then
making trianguiations and studying the
contour of the coast. We have also been
taking regular soundings.
"We have been out at sea during almost
the whole of the_ present season, away
from towns and stations and where we
saw no one. It would have been very
lonely, but fortunately we were working
along the line of the regular mail and
passenger steamers to Alaska. A steamer
came by us each Way every two weeks.
"The steamer from below brought our
mail and took aboard any we had, and
the letters and capers we got helped im

HARRY EMERIC
AND THE GOVERNOR
The Fish Commissioner
Resigned Because He
Was Angry.
Budd Was Slow in Appointing
Alexander Vogelsang
to Office.
WHY MORBISON WAS ABSENT
The New Board Will Be Composed
of Emeric, Vogelsang and Mor
rison of Sacramento.
Harry Emeric, who is one of the three
Fish Commissioners of thig State, is a very
near friend of the Governor.
Mr. Emeric, it is said, used his influence
and expended several thousand dollars in
making a fight for James H. Budd when
he was in the field two years ago against
M. M. Estee. the defeated candidate. The
Governor thoroughly appreciated tne good
work accomplished by Mr. Emeric in his
behalf, and unhesitatingly appointed him
to the position he i-ought, winch was that
of Fish Commissioner.
Mr. Emeric is passionately fond of
angling; in fact, betakes more enjoyment
in fishing than in any other pastime, and
it cannot be gainsaid that since his ap
pointment he has proved a valuable ad
junct to the Fish Commission.
William C. Murdoch was Emeric's right
bower, and when Mr. Morrison of Sacra
mento was appointed by Governor Budd
to succeed H. L. Macneil of .Los Angeles
Emeric put on his warpaint, and, so the
story goes, he informed his friend the
Governor that Morrison was a stranger to
matters that pertained to fish, etc.
The Governor informed his friend
Emaric that the sportsmen of the State
were desirous that some person conversant
with the game interests should figure on
the commission, hence the appointment
of Mr. Morrison.
The latter gentleman attended some of
the meetings of the commission in this
city, but he says he discovered that all fish
and no game was the order of business,
and that his suggestions in reference to
the importation and protection of game
birds and animals received a cool recep
tion from his confreres, so he grew dis
gusted, and for several months subse
quent to the first and second meetings of
the commissioners, which he attended, he
has remained aloof from the regular ses
sions. In fact, according to a copy of the
biennial report of the commission, Mr.
Morrison's name is omitted.
Owing to some unexplained cause Mr.
Murdoch handed in his resignation to the
Governor some months ago. Mr. Enienc
suggested the name of Alexander Vogel
sang. The Governor seemingly was a
little tardy in appointing Mr. Vogelsang
to the position left vacant by the resigna
tion of Mr. Murdoch, and as a result Mr.
Emeric, who evidently did not approve of
the Governor's slow methods, forwarded
his resignation as a representative of the
StÂ»te Fisii and Game Commission.
Now that the Governor has appointed Mr.
Vogelsang a fish commissioner, it is pre
sumed that Mr. Emeric will reconsider bis
determination to resign from the commis
sion, and that the new board will be com
posed of Emeric, Vogelsang and Morrison.
WITHOUT FENDERS.
Suit Against the Market-Street Rail
way on Account of a ISoy's
Death.
Attorneys Henley & Costello, on behalf
of their client, Mrs. Ella Green, will to-day
file a suit against the Market-street Rail
way Company for $50,000 damages on ac
count of the killing of her minor son,
Eddie Galvey, by a Mission-street electric
car on the 20th of last month.
An important principal point involved
is the question of the liability incurred by
the company for exceeding the lawful
speed in running cars, and for neglecting
to lurnish cars with proper guards or fen
ders as thoy are required to do by a statute
passed by the Supervisors of this City and
County, and approved June 26, 1889.
The plaintiff sets forth the requirements
of the ordinance, to the effect that the
guards for dummies or cable-cars must be
so constructed as to prevent the killing of
persons who may be accidentally struck
thereby, so far as the same is practicable "
and that the design ior such fender should
be submitted to the Board of Supervisors
for approval or rejection.
The complaint alleges that no such pre
vention was taken by the company, and
that in consequence of such neglect the
boy was killea. It is also alleged that the
car was going ten or fifteen miles an hour
which is much in excess of the lawful
speed of eight miles an uour.
A million acres of forest are cut down
every year to supply European railway
companies with sleepers on which the
lines are laid.

DIOCKERY AND HIS
FOOD STATIONS
One of the fiest Inspecting
Systems in the
World.
Not Only Milk but Meat, Vege
tables and Liquors to
Bs Tested.
A NEW CHEMICAL LABORATOBY
The Terror of Impure-Milk Veniers
Will Still Skirmish Around in
the Roads.
This City has now in operation what
may well be considered one of the most
thorough systems of food inspection to be
found anywhere in the country, or, for
that matter, in any other country.
It consists of four food-inspection sta
tions, covering the whole of the City and
Coumy of San Francisco. No. 1 is situ
ated near the ferries, at the foot of Clay
street; No. 2at the intersection of Fourth
and Berry streets, No. 3 at the intersec
tion of Army and Alabama streets, ana
No. 4 on Geary street, near Central avenue.
A year ago the Ist of last October the
milk inspection of this City had its in
ception. J. P. Dockery was appointed
Chief Milk Inspector, and tne crusade
was carried on, to the tune of cracking re
volvers and the merry clink of milk
cans being emptied of their impure con
tents.
In February last an ordinance was
adopted by the Board of Supervisors spe
cifying that ever vender of milk must ob
tain a permit from the Board of Health.
Application blanks were made out giving
all data pertaining toeach man's business.
He was permitted to choose which station
ho would rather pass through nightly to
have his milk inspected.
The ordinance provides that all dealers
must have their permit number on the
side 3of their wagon seats. These num
bers have been segregated according to
ttie station through which the vender
passes.
The deputies in charge of these stations
make daily examinations of the milk, and
in case they find it net up to the standard
they take two samples, each in a pint bot
tle. The milk is then emptied into the
gutter.
The samples taken are hermetically
sealed with wax, one being returned to
the dealer, the other being set aside in the
station and properly labeled for identifica
tion. Each day one inspector will maka
the round of the stations and take all
samples to Chief Food Inspector Dockery's
office in the new City Hall.
The fact of a dealer having a certificate
of inspection on his wagon by no means
grants him immunity from examination
on the road. Dockery is iikely to pop up
with his little lactometer at any time, and
a man who has watered his milk after
leaving any of the stations will find him
self in a sorry predicament. Any wagon
carrying a certificate of inspection and
adulterated milk at the same time will
subject the owner to a loss of his license.
The originator of the station idea is J.
B. Reinstein, attorney for the Board of
Health. It is claimed that by its opera
tion in a short time no one will attempt
to sell adulterated milk.
In rejrard to the inspection of foods other
than milk, the Intention of the Board of
Health is to wage war on everything
found adulterated. This will include
vegetables, meats, canned goods, wines
and liquors.
As soon as the chemical laboratory
planned by the board is completed the
various deputy inspectors will collect
samples -of different kinds of foods
throughout the City. All adulterated
brands will be condemned and confis
cated.
Dealers in the same will be handled in
accordance with the pure food laws of the
State of California. It will cost about
$10,000 per annum to operate the stations.
