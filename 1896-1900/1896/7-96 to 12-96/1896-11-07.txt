CHICAGO'S RATIFICATION.
Enthusiastic Speeches Follow the
Signs of Prosperity.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 6.â A grand Re
publican ratification meeting, surpassing
in enthusiasm any of the gatherings held
in the big theater during the campaign,
was held in thÂ« Auditorium to-night. At
every 'mention of Major McKinley's name
trie tremendous crowd cheered wildly.
The following telegram was react by Chair
man Ferd Peck:
Canton, Ohio, Nov. 6, 1896.
Ferd . W. Peek, chairman rj the ratification
meeting, Chicago: The cause of country is al
ways above that of party, and it is significant
and gratifying that the great city of Chicago
has rendered so decisive averdict tor National
honor, law and order. Let us rejoice that the
people have so splendidly vindicated the
strength and beneficence of our matchless
free institutions. William McKinley.
Â° The principal speech of the evening was
"delivered by Charles G. Dawes, the Illinois
member of the executive committee of the
Republican National Committee. Mr.
Dawes was one of the first to enter the
.preliminary fight to secure McKinley's
nomination at St. Louis, and owing; to his
intimate acquaintance with McKin^ey
unusual significance is attached to his re
marks. He ?aid: *
It is deemed appropriate in political strife
that victory be celebrated, and we are gath
ered here to-night for that purpose. While we
are all happy that by a vast majority of the
popular vote allegiance has again been pledged
to the underlying principles of constitutional
government, we must remember as well that
what we have won as a people in - this cam
paign is only the opportunity to work out our
own salvation.
My friends, this country is confronted by
serious problems. Before the next President
of the United States and this great party which
we have put in power are conditions which
must be met. We cannot close onr- eyes to
them. . Poverty â almost famineâ exists In
many parts of our treat cities. . In the month
of February alone the County Agent of Cook
County rendered aid to over 10,000 deserving
and buffering families. During the bitter cold
of last winter American citizen!* walked our
streets desperate and hungry. As I have gone
to and from my: office In this great city I have
been stopped by man after man, asking not
for money, but in God's name, for work.
We must now as a party and as a people
turn from attacking the falsehood* of the
demagogue to devising those means by which
the man willing to work may find work. That
this has been the issue of the campaign . no
*>:;â¢â  has realized more fully than our match
â Â«Â» leader, the PreÂ«ident-elect of the United
*iates; William McKinley. [Great cheering,]
IV-Ue during all this ciiij.a gn/ publicly ami
privately, In hi* letter of acceptance and in
the speeches' which be. delivered* from the
porch of his horn.-, he has maintained that our
money must be sound, and has met. that iÂ«*oe
fairly and fcquart:>, yet let , a ,. Impress upon
. you that the fundamental principle utx>Â»
' which he has sought and received the mfpvt
. of the American people in UnÂ»; ; That in order

"Against the ordinary exploits of the new journalism the individual citizen has
protection to this extent, at least, that he can keep its hideous emanations out of his
own house."â New York Sun.
to get any money, whether it is good money or
bad money, men must get work, and tnat a
protective tariff, properly framed, gives the
American citizen work.
In this campaign our people have sternly re
buked doma?ogism, but our industrial and
social salvation cannot he wrought out by the
destruction of the demagogue alone. The
foundation for National prosperity must be
laid in constructive statesmanship. Above all
things this people o: our*, who are working
out as never before the great problem of hu
man liberty, must strive to learn better the
lesson of sweet charity and brotherly love. I
we made more effort to care for the people
who ought to complain and do not, and paid
less attention to those who ou-ht not to com
plain and do, this would be a happier and bet
ter coun try.
And now that the campaign is over, with
added confidence in the loyalty and honor of
the American people, without resentment
toward political opponents, with an honest
and high purpose to bear our share of the
common burden, let us turn again to the walks
of ordinary life. [Applause.]
Short addresses were made by General
McNulta, Bishop Fallows and Postmaster

TO REMAIN AT HOME.
Major McKinley Compelled to De-
dine to Pay Visits.
CANTON, Ohio. Nov. 6.â A delegation
of prominent Cincinnati men came to
canton late this afternoon to invite Major
McKinley to be present at the annual
dinner of the Commercial Club of Cincin
nati on the 19th of November. Major
McKinley received his visitors in the
library, and after they were comfortably
seated Lars Anderson, the spokesman, ad
dressed some remarks to Major McKinley
and urged him strongly to visit Cincin
nati.
Major McKinley thanked his callers
heartily for the compliment of their visit
and for tbe invitation they bore. He as
sured them it would give him great pleas
ure to go to Cincinnati, but he had con
sidered the matter of visiting large cities
pretty carefully and had decided that with
the exception of the brief period he is to
spend in Cleveland he will not leave Can
ton tilt he goes to Washington.
Major McKinley explained that some
of his Chicago friends had urged him with
'â¢reat vehemence to visit their city, and
said C. N. Bliss and others were coming
out to ask him to visit New York. He
.said if he went to Cincinnati he would
also liave to go to the other places, and
he would, therefore, be compelled to de
cline the invitation. Major McKinley
feels that he has a vast amount of labor to
perform beiore the 4th ol March, and he
does not want to lose time and strength
in going about the country. Unless the
health of Mrs. McKinley should demand
a change ofair he will adhere to his deter
mination to remain in Canton now as
rigidly as he did before the election.

SOUTH DAKOTA SAFE.
Republican Electors Win by Three
Hundred Votes.
PIERRE, 8. Dak., Nov. 6â Returns
came in during the afternoon and evening
from Nowlin, Jackson, Sterling and New
ton counties. These all give small majori
ties for Bryan. On the face of the returns
McKinley eiectors have carried South Da
kota by Mi o.
It is now definitely known that hun
dreds of illegal votes were cast, and that a
number of counties were colonized dv
tramps, thrashing crews, etc., from the
Minnesota, Wyoming and Montana bor
ders. One hnndred men have been ar
rested in the State for illegal voting, but
under the laws this cannot affect the
result.
Accurate returns on the State will not
be had until to morrow. Only one of the 71
Democratic Legislators (Pettigrew) is free
silver, and the remaining members are
old-line Populists. The Republicans have
elected 55 out of 126 members of the Legis
lature.
Chairman Estabrook of tbe Populist

that Senator Kyle will be his own succes

Bryan Electors Carry the State by

RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 6.â The result
in this State on the National ticket seems
to be that the majority for Bryan is 20,000.
The First, Sec nd, Third, Fourth, Fifth,
Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Districts re
turn Democrats to Congress. In the
Tenth the vote is very close, the general
summary so far giving Yost R. 16 ma
jority and the result probably depends on
the decision in regard to tbe irregularities
in one county. The Ninth District is cer
tainly Republican. The othcial vote is
coming in slowly from all over the State,
as many of the election boarda adjourned
over until next wees.

Unfortunate Mrs. Castle
Convicted on Charges
of Theft.
Although Physicians Testify in
Her Favor She Is to Be
Kept in JaiL
IHREE MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT
Walter M. Caste, However, Is Cleared
of the U just Accusations Mads
Against Him.
LONDON, Exg., Nov. 6.â The case of
Mr. and Mrs. Walter M. Castle of San
Francisco, accused of shoplifting came up
for trial in the Clerkenwell Sessions this
morning. There were seven indictments
against the prisoners, charging them with
stealing articles, the total value of which
was Â£43 10s.
Tue greatest interest was manifested in
the trial, not only by the immediate friends
of the Castles, but by many others as well,
for the case has attracted general atten
tion. The counsel for the Castles had littlo
to say in advance, and what little they
said seemed to be designed rather to cheer
their clients than to express their own be
liefs. They were, however, or professed to
be, confident of the acquittal of Mr. Castle.
Where the doubt entered was in the case
of Mrs. Castle.
That she was in a deplorable physical
and mental condition was asserted, but
on the other hand the jury that was to
try her was made up of the same kind of
men as those who had suffered from the
thefts committed, and mercy could not be
expected from them. Chairman McCon
neli presided, and on the bench were half
a dozen magistrates. The courtr om was
crowded, rur.ny of the spectators being
ladies. A number of officials of the United
States embassy were present, including
Secretary Roosevelt and Chief Clerk Hob
son.
The case for the prosecution opened
promptly at 10:30 o'clock. When the case
was called the chairman began proceed
ings by ordering the surrender of the
prisoners by their bondsmen, they having
been at liberty* in Â£40,000 bail pending
their trial. There was a momentary pawse
before the defendants appeared, and the
crowd of spectators remained hushed and
expectant until the Castles entered and
were formally surrendered.
Mrs. Castle seemed almost prostrated.
She was attended by two nurses and
helped to her place by her busbani!, who,
though he seamed greatly depressed, still
preserved a manly and self-reliant bear
ing. D.iring the reading of the charge
Mr. Castle remained boldly upright and
answered "Not guilty" to each of the
seven counts.
On behalf of Mrs. Castle, Sir Edward
Clarke said that she pleaded guilty to
each charge, and proceeded to give the
reason for making eucU a plea, calling
attention to the physical and mental con
dition of his client. While Sir Edward
Clarke was speaking Mrs. Castle remained
seated. She was dressed in somber black
and kept her face covered with a handker
chief.
While the jury was being sworn the
silence was broken only by Mrs. Castle's
sobbing. When the first charge wa3
read â that of stealing a sable tie worth Â£9,
and a skin worth 5 shillings â Mr. Avery,
for the prosecution, said:
"Subject to any opinion which your
Lordship may express it appears to mo
that Mr. Castle was not a party to the
thefts and, therefore, the prosecution will
not offer any evidence against Mr. Castle.
While the case was in the Police Court
and both prisoners were denying guilt it
was impossible for the prosecution to take
this course, for as long as the wife denied
her guilt it was possible that the husband
had taken tbe things."
The chairman replied: "I have read
the depositions carelr.iiy and have ar
rived at the same conclusion. There is
nothing in the evidence tbat has im
peached the innocence of Mr. Castle and
I entirely approve the course you have
taken in the matter."
Mr. Avery, upon receiving the reply of
the chairman, announced formally that
the prosecution would not offer any evi
dence against Mr. Castle.
The chairman then addressed the jury,
saying: "As there is no evidence to sup
port the indictment against the defend*
ant, Walter M. Castle, it is your duty to
render a verdict of not guilty."
The jury responded with averdict of not
guilty and Mr. Castle was immediately
discharged. Upon application of Sir Ed
ward Clarke to the court Mrs. Castle was
allowed to leave the courtroom attended
by her nurses.
Sir Frank Lockwood, Q. C, then began
his opening for the defense, dilating in
the course of his address upon the terrible
position of Mrs. Castle, who had hitherto
been a reputable woman, occupying a
high social position.
Mr. Avery replied, giving the details of
the evidence as taken in tbe Police Court
in regard to the searching of Mrs. Castle's
trunks, in which a museum of articles was
found, many of them atiil having their
sale tickets attached. In not a single in
stance, ne said, was Mr 3. Castle detected
in taking anything, so tbat she must have
done her work so skillfully that even her
husband, who was beside her, was unable
to see what she was doing.
Bir Edward Clarke, Q. C, for the defense
said that in view of the cruelty to which
Mrs. Castle would have been subjected
in having the facts discussed before her he
had advised the lady to plead guilty. She
was not in want of money, and that it was
insanity that caused the thefts was proved
in the fact of her banding a piece of fur
with a ticket attached showing the name
of the owner, price, etc., to another person
for the purpose of getting the fur matched.
Mrs. Castle, he said, had had a mental
, malady when she was a girl, and that2
malady had been recurring during the last
few months.
Dr. Grigps, a specialist in women 9 dis
eases, was called to the staÂ»d and testined
that he had examined Mrs. Castle and
found that her condition was such as to
justiy him in concurring In the statement
made by Sir Edward Clarke. Such a con
dition, he said, generally resulted in men
tal disturbances, religious and other forms
of mania, and rendered the sufferer irre
sponsible for her actions.
Dr. Savage, one of the lending special
ists in female diseases in England, nt-xt
took the stand and corroborated the U'hti
rnony of Dr. Grieg 1 ?.
At thi-> point in the proceedings the
crush in tbe courtroom had become almost
s-uffocating, and a number of ladies in the
crowd were allowed to taue seats upon the
magistrates' bench, an unusual occur
rence, while others found seats upon the
stairs and in anil around the counsel's
bench, until every inch of available space
Mas filled.
Alderman Roitlege, Major Egan of the
United States army. Colonel H. J. Hawes
of San Francisco ana other friends of Mr.
and Mrs. Castle were in the court ready to
testify in behalf oi Mrs. Castle. Mr. Castle
himself, wbo had left :he room alter his
discharge, now appeared i*i court.
Di. Gabriel of the College of Surgery
supported the testimony already given by
medical experts, and said that utetine
troub es had affected Mrs. Castles mind.
He had warned her several times to avoid
all excitement. He. together with Drs.
Scott and Savage, had seen her*profes
?.onally on October 18 while she was in
jail, and the three had discussed her case
exhaustively at the time. They had
a reed that her further imprisonment
would imperil her reason.
Dr. Scott, who was the next witness,
testified that the nervousness from which
Mrs. Ca~tle suffered had continued during
toe entire time she was in jail, and he had
made a report of his examination to the
â Home Office, advising against her further
imprisonment. The lady has no fixed de
lusions, tie said, but was ol unstable
mind and liable to do eccentric things
unless she was carefully looked after by
her friends.
Sir Edward Clarke here interposed, say
ing tnat Mrs. Castle ! > friends were only
too anxious to remove her to a place <>f
quiet, .1 ttie court took, a favorable view
of the matter.
The chairman said that the question as
to the effect which imprisonment would
have upon Mrs. Castle was one which
must be considered elsewhere. The chair
man and tbe magistrate retire 'â  to another
room for the purpose of deliberation.
After fifteen minutes' absence the magis
trates returned to tne courtroom, iv
which profound silence reigned.
Mrs. Cas le was then brought into cov.rt,
ana the clerk of the court announced that
Ella Castle tad been convicted upon all of
the seven indictments.
Chairman McConneil said: "Ihe court
has had great difficulty in dealing with an
exceedingly painful case, upon which
sympathy so powerful had been brought
to bear until almost to interfere with jus
tice." The court knew that the sentence
which it became his duty to pass upon the
prisoner would be well weighed elsewhere,
and if any suffering dangerous to her life
or intellect should follow it would be im
mediately met by anoiher authority. He
would not prolong the painful scene and,
therefore, would at once proceed to pass
sentence, which was that the prisoner be
confined in jail without hard labor for
three months.
As the chairman pronounced the sen
tence all < yes turned upon Mrs. Castle, who
stood dazed for a moment, and then as tbe
full import of the chairman's words came
to her became hysterical, obliging the
nurses and the prison warden to suppress
her. She then betran to moan piteoosty
and finally to scream and struggle vio
lently. She was removed from the room
as quickly as possible, and as she was
being taken away cried out: "What does
it mean?' "My God, what does it
mean?"
A quod many of the ladies in the court
room exhibited strong emotion and sev
eral wept. All expressed deep sympathy
with the unlortunate prisoner, whose
screams could be heard faintly issuing
from the underground passage through
which she was taken, even after the court
room had been cleared.
After the excitement following the con
viction and sentence of Mrs. Castle i.ad
been allayed the stolen articles found in
her possession were ordered to be restored
to their owners.
Upon the application of Mr. Avery,
counsel for the prosecution, Dr. Scott, one
of the expert witnesses, expressed sur
prise that In view ot the evidence Mrs.
Castle had been convicted, and saia that
even after her conviction he had believed
tnat the sentence would be merely nomi
nal. Everything possible would be done
for lier in a medical way, he said, during
her imprisonment.
Several of the merchants who had testi
fied to having lost property found in the
possession of Mrs. Castle said after the
trial that they were convinced that the
lady was mentally irresponsible and that
they bad no expectation that she wouid
be convicted.
Mr. Hod.-on of the United States em
bassy expressed the opinion that Mrs.
Castle would bÂ» released inside ot a week,
and Mr. Abrahams of counsel for tie de
fense said that measures for a reprieve
had already been taken.
Mr. Castle expressed the thanks of him
self ana his wife for the unceasing kind
ness of their fi iends and the hope that
Mrs. Castie would speedily be relieved
from tbe terrible condition in w.iich she
is placed.
Mr. Castle was congratulated upon his
own release from custody. He said that
it was oniy justice that he had received,
but he was not satisfiei with the result
of his wife's case. He was exceedingly
anxious abort her, he said, and desirous
of removing her to a place of rest at the
earliest possible moment.
Application has aiready been made to
the Home Office for Mrs. Castle's release,
and it ie understood that her sentence is
practically formal and that she will be
liberated in a lew days.
That she was in a deplorable physical
and mental condition was asserted, but,
on the other band, the jury that was to
try her was made up oi men devoid of
.sentiment and from whom mercy could
not be expected.
Sir Edward Clark says he expects that
Mrs. Castle will be released to-morrow.
Commenting upon the conviction of Mrs.
Castle, the Chronicle will to-morrow lav
that if ever there was a distinct case o.
kleptomania it is that of Mrs. Castle.

Dec'ares That the Friends o

Been Vanquished.
DOES NOT FEEL-AT ALL SORE.
s
An Ambition to Secura Immediat
Legislation Instaad of Ei joying
Honors ol O.fice.
LINCOLN, Nebr.. Nov. 6.â William J.
Ei-yan tbis afternoon gave out tbe follow
ing statement to the bimetalhsts of tbe
United States:
Conscious that millions of loyal hearts are
saddened by temporary defeat, I beg to off-.r a
word of hope and encouragement. No chu.su
ever had supporters more brave, earnest and
devoed thau thos'i who have espoused the
e&aM of bimetallism. They have fought from
conviction and have fought with-all the zeal
which conviction inspires. Time will prove
whether they are right or whether they are
wrong. Having done their duty as they saw
it they have nothing to regret.
The Republican candidate has been heralded
as tne advance agent of prosperity. If his pol
icies bring real prosperity to the American
people those who opposed him will share in
thÃt prosperity. If, o:i the other band, his
policies prove an injury to the people gener
ally those of his supporters who do not belong
to the office-holdi-ig class or to the privileged
classes will suffer in common with those who
opposed.
The friends of bimetallism have not been
vanquished; they have Bimply been over
come. They believe that the gold standard is
a conspiracy of the money changers against
the welfare of the human race, and until con
vinced of their error they will continue the
warfare against it
The contest has been waged this year under
great embarrassments and against great odds.
For the fir~t time during this generation pub
lic attention has been centered upon the
money question as the paramount issue, and
this has been done in t>j ite of all attempts
upon the part of our ouponents to prevent it.
The Republican couven. ion held out the de
lusive hope of international bimetallism,
while Republicans labored secreily fur gold
monometallism. Gold - standard "Democrats
have publicly advocated the election of the
Indianapolis ticket wbile ifcey laDored secretly
lor the election of the Republican ticket. The
trusts and corporations have tried to excite a
IMZ of lawlessness while they tncmseivos nave
been defying the law. And American finan
ciers have boasted that they were the custo
dians of Na.ional honor, while they were
secretly bartering away the Nation' b financial
independence.
But hi spite of the efforts of tbe admin
istration and Its supporters, in spite of the
threats of money-loauers at home and abroad,
in spite of coercion practiced on corporation
employes, in spite ot trusts and syndicates,
in spite of an enormous Republican cau.paign
fund and in spito oi the ii.nueuce of a hostile
press, bimetallism has almost triumphed in
its first great flgnt. The loss of a few States,
and that, too, by very small pluralities, has
defeated bimetallism, but bimetallism
emerges from the contest stronger than it was
four months ago.
I desire to commend the work of the Na
tional Committee who had the management
of this campaign, t'o-operation between the
memoers ot different political organizations
is always dim'cult, but it has been less so this
year than usual. Interest in a common cause
of great importance has reduced iriction to a
minimum. I hereby express my personal
gratitude to the individual members, as well
as the executive oflicers oi the National Com
mittee of the Democratic, Populist ana Silver
parties for their efficient, untiring and un
belfish labors. They have laid the louudation
for future success, and will be remembered as
pioneers when victory is at last secured.
No personal nor political friend need griete
because of my deieat- My ambition has been
io secure immediate legislation rather than to
enjoy ihe honors of office, and therefore de
feat brings to me no ieeiing ot personal loss.
Speaking for the wile who has shared my
Jabors as well as for myself, I desire to say
that we have been amply repaid for ail thn"t
we have done. In the love of millions ot our
fellow-citizens, so kindly expressed; in Hie
knowl.dgu gained by personal contact with
the people, and in broadened sympathies, we
find lull compensation for whatever efforts we
have put forth. Our hearts have been toucned
by tne devotion of Jriends, and our lives shall
prove our appreciat inn of the affection of tbe
plain people, an affection which we prize as
the highest reward which this campaign has
brought.
In the face of the enemy rejoicing in its
victory let the roll be called for the next en
gagement, and urge all friends ol bimetallism
to renew their all" iriance to the cause. If we
are right, as I believe we are, we shall yet tri
umph. Until convinced of his error let tad!
advocate of bimetallism continue tbe work.
Let a;i fci.ver clubs retail, th'ir organ, zations,
hold regular meetings and freely circulate
silver liter'ture.
Our opponents have succeeded in this cam
paign, an > must now put their theories to the
test. Instead of talking mysteriously about
"sound money" end "an honest dollar" they
must now elaborate and defend a financial
system. Every step taken by them snould be
publicly considered by the silver clubs.
Our cause has prospered most where the
money question has been longest discussed
mining the people. During the nex; lour
years it will be studied all over this Nation,
even more than it has been studied in the
past. The year 1900 is not far away. Hefore
that year arrives international bimeta.lism
will cease to deceive. Before that ytar arrives
those who have called themseives Go'd-stan
dani DeinocrÂ» ts will become bimetal ists and
be with us or they will have become Republi
cans and become open enemies. Before that
\ ear arrives trusts will have convinced more
people that a trust is a menace to private wel
fare and the public safety. Before that year
arrives the evil effects of a gold standard will
be even more evident than they ere now, and
the people then will be ready to demand an
American financial poiicy, for the American
people will join with us In the immediate
restoration of free and unlimited coinage of
goid and sliver at the present legal ratio of
16 to 1 Without waiting for the aid or consent
of any other nation. \V. J..BEYAN.
THE SANTA FE RECEIVERSHIP.
Judge Keeler Makes a Statement of the
Company's Condition and as to
His Petition.
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 6.â Judge Keeler
this morning gave out this stateroant as
to his reason for applying for a receiver
for the Santa Fe road:
"The condition of the new company is
worse than the condition of the old com
pany at tbe time it was closed out. On
June 30. 1895, tbe outstanding capital
stock anu mortgage bonds of the old com
pany amounted to $344,677,729 48. On
June 30, 1896, the standing capital stock
and mortgage bonds of the companies
amounted to $398,718,500.
"The property and assets of the old and
new company are practically the same.
The income of the o'd company for the
year ending Jane, 1895, was $438,379 77â
less than a year's interest on its bond in
debtednebs. Tbe result oi the first year's
operation of the new company will not be
known to the public until it fil^s its an
nual report in 1897, but there is no good
reason to believe that its earnings will be
eullicient to pay any dividend on capital
stock, not even the full amount of annual
interest on its bunded indebtedness.
"The entire property was sold in Decem
ber, 1893, for $600,000. By the foreclosure
proceedings against the old com pan v and
oy wbat is calied the reorganization, the
manipulators of the affairs of the old com

NEW YORK, N. V., Kov. 6.â lt is
learned at ihe office of the Atchison, T<>
peka and Santa Fe Railroad that the mat
ter relating to a receive; ship for tbe prop
erty of tbe company in Kansas is merely
tbe carrying out of an agreement between
the oia ana new companies to clear up old
lcpil complications.
Victor Morawitz, general counsel for the
Atcbison, says oi the receivership in-
Kansas:
"I am informed that it is not proposed
to disturb the operation of the property by
the present company, and I am satisfied
thai there is nothing in the proceedins
which the stockholders or bondholders
need iear in the least."

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov. 6.-Im
portant steps in connection with the plan
to rehabilitate the Philadelphia and Read
ing Railroad and Coal and Iron compa
nies were taken this afternoon at a special
meeting of the stock olders of the Na
tional company. It developed that this
corporation is to act as the parent com
pany of the reorganized Reading prop
erties.
The conference was called for the pur
pose of increasing the capital stock of the
National Company to $40 : 000,000, and the
proposition was ratified without a dis.-ent
ing voice. It is understood that the Na
tional company is to purchase the con
trolling interest in both tbe Readinir and
coal companies and operate the proper
ties under the name of the Philadelphia
and Reading Railroad Company. This
docs not mean (hat there will be any
change in the executive management of
the Reading Company.
It was stated to-day that the Reading
receivers will turnover the property to the
reorganization committee on November 30.
THE DESTR OF INNOCENCE.
Unna'ural Father Turns the Gas on

TOLEDO, Ohio, Nov. 6.â Conrad Eich
horn, a local cigarniaker, murdered his
13-year-old son and killed himself in a
peculiar manner last night.
Eicbhorn and his boy put up for the
night at Enteman's Hotel. The clerk sup
posed they were strangers. This morning
gas was discovered escaping from tbeir
room, to which entrance was forced.
Father and son lay in bed as if in slumber.
A gas chandelier lying on the floor and a
strong odor of gas told the story. The

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
Bids for Nearly $i,oo?,coo Worth

tisei For.
Eff ct of McKin.ey's Victory on the
Lighthiu;e Board ana Supply
Departments.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 6.â A Sun
special from Washington says: The de
feat of the Democratic ticket will result in
large contracts being awarded at once by
the Government involving almost $1,-
O'O.OOO, the advertisements for which
have been held back at tbe request of
prospective bidders until after the future
financial policy of the country had been
decided.
Of this sum the Lighthouse Board of the
Treasury has been waiting two months to
spend $325,000 in the construction of three
lighthouse tenders and two liuht vessels,
and they would have had them under way
long ago but for the indisposition of the
firms to bid for the wort previous to the
election.
Within a few days these boats will be
open to competition and some lively and
close bidding is expected. Contracts lor
supplies under the various departments
have also been held back, when usually
they are given soon after tbe fiscal year
begins in July, and enormous sums await
to ba expended in tbe improvement of
rivers and harbors, which would have been
in circulation three months ago but for the
uneasiness caused by the campaign.
Tbe greatest contract awarded by the
Government in the last few months in
volved ever $10,000,000 for the construc
tion of three new battle-ships and elevt n
torpedo boats, and had the Navy Depart
ment authority to postpone the opening
of the bi is until this week it would un
questionably have done so, as required by
the leading ship firms. Since then there
have been but few advertisements issued
by the departments for work of any kind,
as it was realized that if bids were sub
mitted previous to tbe election they would
probably be higber than now and the com
petition less close. There was an indica
tion of the confidence which has been re
stored when several persons appeared at
the District tax office and offered gold in
large quantities in payment for their debts.

SENATOR TILLMAN
WILDLY PRATTLES
Chagrined by Defeat, but
Remains Talkative, as
Usual.
Peculiar Reasons Attributed to
the Triumph o! Major
McKinley.
BRAYS "FRAUL" QUITE LOUDLY
Declares That Dave Hill Is a Dead
Euck and That Gold Democrats
Mast Go.
ATLANTA, Ga., Nov. 6. â Senator
Bei.jarnin TUlman of South Carolina, who
was here to-day on bis way home from
Chicago, declared that Bryan would be
the nominee of the Democratic party in
1900.
"The battle has been the most heated
and hardest fought political contest in our
history, and the Democratic party has
n>ver shown to better advantage," said
Senator Tiilman. "The is-ues have been
clearly defined and bravely sustained,
while our great leader, Bryan, has covered
himself with glory and is the idol of the
Democratic masses."
"To what caus s do you attribute Mc-
Kin:ey's triumph?"
"There were several causes, all of them
making a combination that it was impos
sible to overcome. In the first place, the
odium attaching to the Democracy Irom
Clevelandism and all that it implies drove
from us hundreds of thousands of men.
Hard times, the issue of bonds in time of
peace, the so-called free-trade tariff bill,
me loss of employment â all tiese were
charged to tbe Democratic party, and the
Democratic speakers and the few Demo
cratic newspapers whicn reached the
masses in the Nort crn cities were power
less to obliterate the impression. The
Democratic party suffered, although it
had repudiated both Cleveland and his
policy.
"Then the unblushing use of money in
unlimited quantities controlled many
thousands of votes. Tbe campai n of
Republicans was conducted by the Repub
licans with great vigor by a la^ee corps of
well-trained speakers, many of them men
of National repute, while tie Democracy
without means relied upon volunteer
speakers and these could not cover the
nel.i as thoroughly as their opponents.
"A third factor was the threat open or
implied by thousands of owners of manu
factories and workshops that Bryan's elec
tion meant the closing down of work.
The army of idle men were promised work
if McKinley should triumph. The Repub
lican masses in tbe country or acricui
tural districts were promised a return of
cood prices and prosperous times under a
Republican tariff policy and the resto
ration of contidence. The natural
ulliance of tne South and West, though
not complete, has received an impetus
which cannot be stopped or prevented.
The issue of financial reiorm and restora
tion of the money of the constitution is
not dead and will not down.
"We have broken the solid North, while
the South is practically solid. The
tyranny of the F deral judiciary and the
greed of the plutocrats will drive the
masses by tbe million to our support in
the next great struggle. Jefferson iost his
first battle in 1796 but won in 1800. The
R publican party was overwhelmingly
deieated in ISSG and Lincoln was defeated
for the Senate in- 1858, but he was e.ecied
President in 1860. We will win in 1900.
McKinley cannot give relief or restore
prosperity unless the law of supply and
demand, as it affects money, has been re
pealed."
"Will the policy of the party leaders
look t<> conciliating tbe gold Democrats?"
"No, they have a gold party, to which
they belong, and are a good riddance.
There can be no step backward. Tne
Southern people and the Eastern Demo
crats are separated by an impassable bar
rier. They are our taskmasters and we
know it. We have turned to the West
and must look and work in that direction.
If the Democrats bad put up a gold plat
form ws would not have carried a sincle
State. The men who claimed to be the
gold Democrats voted for McKinley almost
solidly. There may be a spasmodic rise in
prices and a resumption of business activ
ity, but it cannot last."
'"What do you think of David B. Hill's
future?"
"Hill's a dead duct and will never again
rise to the surface," was tbe emphatic
declaration of Senator Tiilman.
GOLD PRCCESS DECISION,
Valuable Gold Recovery Patents
Overthrown by a Pretoria
Court.
The Result Will Be a Very Great
Increase in the World's Stcck
of Gold.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Nov. aâ Word was
received in this city yesterday that the
High Court at Pretoria, the capital of the
South African republic, had declared void
the MacArthur-Forrest patents for the
cyanide process for the recovery ot gold.
This decision was given in a suit brought
by ihe combined owners of Jo
hannesburg and the Transvaal. The in
formation came in this cablegram to Law
yer C. W. Truslow :
â¢'Judgment lor plaintiff. Both patents
canceled."
The decision will have an important
bearing upon every interest connected
with gold-mining, for it is a matter which
involved many millions of dollars directly
and untold millions altosether.
Up to 1891 the reduction works had been
running upon the old plan, stamping the
rock and getting out oi it what gold was
coarse enough to be taken out by quick
silver. All ihe rest ran off with the tail
ings, and hundred h of thousands of tons
of ground rock were shoveled away as
refuse from the stamping-mills until tbere
were hills of it at every mill and a hidden
lortune in every hill.
It whs at this time that the two Scotch
men, MacArthnrand Forrest, tookout pat
ents all over the world lor the cyanide
process of gold reovery. la the single
year of 1894 in the Witwatersrand district
of tbe Transvaal 2.847,376 tons of tailings
and 18,351 tons of concentrate!! were put
through the process, which yielded more
than $10,000,000 worth of god, with an
apparent profit over the cost oi the procebs
of about $7.375,01.0.
This seems to indicate that tbe miners
ought to have been well satisfied. But
there was a serious drawback to their hap
y-iness. The African Gold Recovering
Company, which controlled the MacAr
ihur-Forrest patents in tde South African
republic, did not let any one use tho pro
cess without the payment of b ; g royalty.
These payments varied with Ind. victuals,
but they were so large they amounted to
millions of dollars every year.
The miners made effort* to get reduc
tions of the royalties, but no agreement
was reached. Then they determined to
ii^ht, and made an application to tbe At
torney-General to have tbe patent set
aside because of a lack of noveky.
The Attorney-General appointed James
HÂ»y to bring such an actiou at the miners'
expense in the Higli Court of Justice â tne
equivalent of our United States Supreme
Court â and the court ol" last rpsort. It was
asserted by the miners that although the
patentees 'of the cyanMe proce:^ may have
bi-en original inventors the same thing
had actually been done before, although
not npon a large scale. Commissions were
issued for the taking of testimony in the
Un.ted States, Australia, New Zealand
and En-land in ttie case.
The most important field was in this
country, where Mr. Truslow was employed
to rind the cv d nee for the miners and
Walter W. Williams for the patentees.
Mr. Truslow began his work a yoar and a
half ago, and it led bim toexamine almost
every cltemist of note, every college or
public library, and to look into all sorts of
trades where gold is used for evidences of
wbat he knew was true.
It was shown in the testimony that the
process had actually been used in places
here, and in one instance a quarter of a
ton of ore had been so treated in 1885.
The process was not needed here at that
time, because most of our gold is coarse
enough to work by the cheaper quicksilver
method.
Sinre that time, however, fine grain ore
has been found, and it is said that there
is much of it in the country. The Mer
cur mine of Utah uses the Mac Arthu
r process, and was sued by the pat
entees a while ago, but it made a settle
ment privately.
_ The hear.ngs in tbis country were
finished in September, 1895, and the testi
mony and exhibits wer. put in a tin-lined
box and this was pent as a registered letter
by mail to Pretoria. It made the biggest
registered letter ever sent through the
United States mail. The package was as
bu' as an ordinary dry-goods case and the
postage was $187. it went from the New
York postoffice. The biggest letter before
that bad cost about $40 postage.
The case was iieard by the High Court
of Justice at Pretoria just before Jame
son's raid in December of last year. As
far as ihe South African gold fields are
concerned the decision throws the pro
cess open to the public. It had been at
tacked and the patents overthrown in
Australia, and the belief of the opposing
lawyers now is that nowhere in the world
will the users of the process continue to
pay royalties and will fight and over
throw the patents everywhere. Thi9
means much to the gold miner and proba
bly will result in immense additions to
the world's stock of gold within a few
yeara.
FOUL MURDER BY MONKS
Fate of a Seattle Prospector
Who Was Successful
in Peru.
Had Much Gold Upon Him at the
Time, and Leaves a Fortune
to a Sister.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 6.â The Her
ald special cable from Sucre, Bolivia, says:
It is believed here that T. Cooper, the
American miner who, it is alleged, was
murdered by Indians in the forests of
Cnrabaya some time a^c, was in reality a
victim of Spanish monks in Peru.
Cooper was one of a party of seven, who,
it is said, were attacked by Cunchos In
dians and four of the party killed. Later
this was denied and the statement was
made that he had been drowned. Now,
however, the belief is voiced that he was
murdered by monks, possibly for a
great quantity of gold in his possession.
Cooper worked his way from Seattle,
Wash., to Pern four years ago. He was a
prospector and made friends with tbe
Cunchos Indians, so that he went as he
pleased without fear. He was seen at
Lake Titicaca by F. W. Grauert of this
city three years ago, and had at that time
a quantity of gold with him. In 1895 he
organized a company to work the Cara
baya mine, from which ne had taken the
cold, and later sold it for a large sum to a
Air. Harrison, representing an American
syndicate.
Soon after this Cooper went to the An
des of Peru prospecting, and it is believed
he was attacked there and perhaps killed
by monk?. These monks are the ones who
attacked five Swedish- Americans several
years ago, when the five men fought so
bravely for life. Many other Americans,
too, have been murdered in cold blood un
der suspicious circumstances and nothing
has been done to bring the guilty ones to
justice. .
Cooper had a widowed sister living some
where in Peru (it is not Known where)
who would inherit everything he left. His
property holdings in Bolivia and Peru are
large and would mean a fortune to her if
she could be found.

OCEAN STEAMER
LIMPS INTO PORT
Atlantic Liner Fuerst Bis
marck Shatters Her
Crank Shaft.
Acute Ear of tfce Chief Engineer
Prevents 1 a Serious
Accident.
CAME IN WITH ONE SCREW.
Like the Weather, the Passengers
When They Hard of the Mis
hap Were Calm.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 6.â The dis
abled Hamburg-American line steamer
Fuerst Bismarck limped into port this
afternoon, having met with an accident
which rendered useless one of her engines
at 3:30 o'clock Thursday morning. At
that bour the ship was 460 miles east of
Sandy Hook, making for port at a 20-knot
gait. The weather was calm and the ship
glided along smoothly.
Suddenly a decided vibration was felt
all over the steamer. Chief Engineer
Ludwig Jonas, who happened to be on
deck, realized at once that something was
wrong. Going below, a hurried investiga
tion showed tnat the aft-bearing of the
crank shaft of the starboard engine had
been fractured. He ordered the engine
stopped, allowing the sh'p, which is a
twin screw, to proceed under her port en
gine.
The break proved a bad one and the
discovery by the acute ear of Chief Jonas
came just in time. The fracture occurred
in that part of the shaft just aft of the
crank and Had it not been promptly noted
serious results wonld doubtless have fol
lowed when the engine freed from the
resistance of the propeller began to "race"
at accelerated speed. The crank shaft at
tbe point of the trouble is 19% inches in
diameter and the break was totai. tbe shaft
being completely severed. The chief en
gineer was not prepared to express an
opinion as to the cause of the accident,
but thought it might possibly have been
caused by defective castings.
There was no excitement among the
passengers when the nature of the acci
dent became known and the delay to the
ship was only a few hours, a speed of over
fourteen knots an hour being maintained
w i the port engine alone.
When tne Bismarck arrived off Fire
Island this morning she signaled for tugs
to be sent to her assistance as a precau
tionary measure, Captain Albers deciding
to guard against possible accident in en
tering port through the narrow ship chan-
The repairing of the* broken part was
begun this afternoon, and, as an extra
crank shaft happened to be on board to
replace the disabled one, the ship will be
able to sail on her next schedule day. It
is a coincident that the Fuerst Bismarck
reported the American liner Paris, which
broke her shaft on her last outward
bound trip, at about tbe same distance off
shore as was the Hamburg liner when the
present mishap occurred.
OUTLAW HATFIEL D JUGGED
Leader of the Notorious West
Virginia Clan Captured
at Last.
Surrounied by a Large Besieging
Party in a S one Fort in
the Mountains.
HUNTINGTON, W. Va., Nov. 6.âCap
tain Hattield, the outlaw, and his son
were captured and lodged in jail this
morning.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 6.-A Sun
special from Williamson, Va., says:
Never in the history of Mingo County
and never since the days of the Hatfield-
McCoy feud has this region been so stirred
over any occurrence as it is over the
triple killing by the notorious leader of
tbe Hatfield clan. Captain Hatfield, at
Matewan on Tuesday last The excite
ment has been intensified by rumors of an
uprising of the whole Hatfield clan, num
bering over 100 strong, to cietend their
leader and aid him in keeping out of the
hands of the officers of the law.
After iorty-eight hours of tireless trail
ing and reconnoitering Hattield and about
twenty of his kinsmen have been found at
an old stone fort in the mountains, which
was used by the Hatrlelds as a kind of
headquarters during their trouble with
the McCoys of Kentucky, some five or six
years ago. Men were stationed at various
places along the only line of railroad run
ning near, with strict orders to search all
Uains and all the routes which the Hat
fields would traverse in an effort to get
across inU) Kentucky. The mountains,
which are near the scene of the murder,
are closely guarded. The reward which
was at first offered has been trebled.
At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon a scout
reported to Sheriff Keadle, who was then
near the place, the place of hiding of the
Hatticlds. The fort is on a tributary of the
Guindotte River, in Logan County, about
twenty miles east of here. It is situated
in a rocky canyon, so as to be accessible
from only one side. It is built wtioilv of
stone, even to the roof. Lodged here,
with plenty of provisions, a small number
of determined me^i could resist an attack

was reached about 10 o'clock last nigbt
and an attack will probably be made on
the fort to-day. The Hatflelds have all
been trained from their infancy in the use

Suicide of a Co trictor
FREMONT, Nebr.. Nov. &â Joseph D.
McDonald, a prominent and wealthy
citizen of Fremont, shot himseli yester
day, causing almost instant d.-ath. The
cause of the act was mental unbalance,
the result of financial reverses in min

was a railroad contractor and built ail the
South P.atte branches of tne Northwestern
road in Nebraska, the Eik Horn system,
and was reputed to be worth over
$100,000.

Hiding- Place.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 6.â A local even
ing paper says: While the furnaces and
boilers in the shops outside of Canton are
being lighted and work has begun, Canton
manufacturers are not behind in the gen
eral awakening to the prospect of increased
business. Snores of telegraphic orders
were sent over the Western Union lines
vitbin forty-eight hours afterit was known
â¢ that McKiniey ha i been elected. These
telegrams were orders for new machinery
to replace '.hat which had be n broken.
' When these machines had been disabled
they were allowed to remain so ami set
aside as they were not needed. Many
have become rusted by months of idle
ness and tbe manufacturers are now bring
ing them out, cleaning them up, ordering
necessary parts and geting ready for busi
ness.
Immediately after tbe announcement of
the election of McKiniey, the Canton Iron
Mills began an addition to their plant.
The new building will be used in the man
ufacture of galvanized iron.
WOONSOCKET, R. L. Nov. 6. âThe
River Spinning Company's factory, after
months of alternate periods of idleness
and short time, started Wednesday morn
ing on full time. The large cotton-mills
at Slatersville will start on full time next
Monday morning and run to their full
capacity.
The officers of the Glenmark Knitting
Company in this city, said to be the larg
er-t knitting concern in the country, which
has been running only several hours daily
for a month past, decided to-day to run
full time owin;: to the large orders com
ing in. Industrial conditions generally
are much improved over two months apo.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 6.â The Erie
Railroad officials have just Issued instruc
tions to three of their principal locomo
tive repair shops to work their forces all
the daylight hours during November,
which means nine hours instead of eight.
. CANONSBURG, Pa., Nov. aâ The elec
tion of McKiniey has startei industrial
matters booming here. At the iron and
tbe steel mill the men had been working
half time, but yesterday tney started in on
full time.
FITTAN'NING, Pa.. Nov. 6.â The Kit
tanning Iron and Steel Company's works
at this place, which have been idle for
months, will start ud in a week as a con
sequence of the election.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 6.â Railroad
ticket agents report that during tne past
twenty-four hours a greater number of
commercial travelers have left the city in
the interest of their respective houses
than at any time since last March. There
Is a general revival of business in all
manufacturing concerns, and it Is esti
, mated that in the starting up of iron
mills, factories and other establishments,
which have been idle during the summer,
at least 4000 men have found employment.
The local banks report heavy deposits of
gold da/ing the past twenty-fonr hoars,
and this is regarded as indicative of a pop
ular movement which will bring out the
gold from its hiding places.
MASSILLON, Ohio, Nov. 6.â The Mul-
Jins Coal Company will open four new
mines in the M as- I lion district, and work
will begin on one at once. Thia venture
is dne to the election of McKin,'ey.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Nov. 6.â Tbe
result of the Presidential election has had
the effect to stimulate the furniture in
dustry of this city in all of its depart
ments. The Pbcenix Company, which has
been closed down for several months, has
started its first department and the other
departments will be started next week.
The factory employs 500 men.
â¢ TheWiddicomb Company started their
shop department to-day and the finishing
departments will resume next week. This
company employs 600 workmen.
The Nelson & Matter Company bought
a lot of lumber, conditional on McKinley's
election, ten cars of which have already
arrived and the rest is on the way. The
company employs about 400 men.
The Grand Rapids Brush Company will
start up Monday with 200 men. All the
other forty iactories of the city are pre
paring to resnme work with Â« full force of
men. The Hamilton cycle factory wi!l
double its force and run full time.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 6. â Greater
activity iÂ» apparpnt in the industrial in
stitutions since Wednesday than at any
time during the year. Every mill and
workshop in Pittsburg is operating more
actively or is preparing to start Monday.
A nnmber of departments which have
been entirely idle or opeiated spasmodi
cally since the summer snut-down will be
In operation next week.
The only industry which has not yet
felt the thrill of reviving confidence is
window glass. Activity in this line is de
layed because of the inability of the work
ers and manufacturers to agree on the
wage scale. It is thought a conference
will be held soon and that an agreement
will be arrived at.
PITTSBURG. Pa., Nov. 6.â The Car
negie Bteel Company to-day decided to
make improvements to its plant involving
an expenditure of $500,000. The order
includes completion of two blast furnaces,
work upon which was stopped about three
months since. It was also decided to
complete the Butler and Pittsburg Rail
road to the lakes which the Garnegie
Company T.as building, work on which
was partially suspended. Contracts were
let to-day amounting to $250,000.
AN INCREASED INQUIRY.
English Manufacturers Now After
American Wools.
LONDON, Eno., Nov. 6.â Since the elec
tion in the United States there has been
an increased innuiry for wools from the
United States, but holders who are ex
pecting a revival of trade in cloih and
wool are very firm, asking 2d above the
closing prices of the lasi series of sales in
some cases.
Melbourne advices say that sales are
proceeding briskly and that American in
quiries have increased. Scourei merinos
and medium inferior greases are at from
par to \i i advance, other grades un
changed. The offerings aggregated 230,000
bales, of which 205,000 were sold.
IN OLD KENTUCKY.
It May Take an Official Count to
Satisfy Both Parties.
LOUISVILLE. Ky.. Nov. 6.-U will
take tbe official count to satisfy both sides
as to the result in Kentucky. The last
newspaper figures place McKinley's plu
rality in the State at 633. The official
count by counties is about complete out
side of this, Jefferson County, which will
not be finished for four or live days, owing
to the large vote, bin the figures are not
obtainable at this hour. The State return
ing board will meet three weeks from
Tuesday to pass on the count by counties.
Kash and Smith, the first electors on the
Republican and Democratic tickets, are
running ahead of the other electors on the
official count and no matter which way
the State goes the electoral vote is goinc
to be divided, that is, if the Republicans
carry the State they will get twelve elec
tors and the Democrats one. and vice
versa if the Democrats win. This results
from the fact that a large number of
voters placed the cross opposite the name
of the first elector instead of under the
party device. The canva-sing board has
ruled in those cases that tbe vote should
count for only one elector notwithstand
ing the evident intention of tne voter.
This raises an interesting question in re
gard to the votes.
The Republicans are very chipper to
night. Chairman Roberts said at 9 o'clock;
"We have received official returns from
all except twenty-seven counties. We
have trustworthy returns from the miss
ing ones, however, and the 119 counties of
the State show 435 plurality for McKiniey.
We are perft-ctly satisfied that we have
carried the State. lam waiting on fur
ther official re.urns, and expect to send
Major McKinley a telegram about mid
night. I concede the Democratic elector
owing to the failure of voters to stamp
their ballots correctly."
Tjry Woodson, member of the free-silver
Democratic committee for Kentucky,
made the following statement:
"I am more confident to-night than I
have been at any time since the election
that the Democratic electoral ticket was
elected in Kentucky, but I have an
abundance of evidence that the Republi
cans of the mountain counties, where
Democrats are exceedingly scarce, have
perpetrated tbe grossest frauds, both be
fore and since the polls closed on Tuesday.
This information has come to me from
the most reputable men at Middlesboro,
Barbourville, London, Somerset and other
towns in Eastern Kentucky.
"The Republican Committee and the
press of Louisville have kept up a steady
claim the past three days of a plurality of
from 500 to 1000 During this time they
have been force! to acknowledge errors
which reduced their claim to 500 in Fay
ette. 633 tv Harding, 494 in Calloway, 331
inKenion, 100 in Campbell, 100 in Scott,
and enough in Christian, Henderson, Mc-
Lean and other counties to still further
reduce their claims more than 3000. Th as
they have been compelled to scale their
calculations nearly 3000 votes, while the
Democratic estimates in these counties
nave been practically unchanged, but
every time they have been forced to acK
knowledge the truth about one of these
central and western counties, which, with
good telegraphic and telephone facilities,
were speedily covered by the news agen
cies, they have been able to draw on one
of these remote counties for a majority far
surpassing anything ever known in their
history, and still they claim the State by
600.
"The Republicans in the outset claimed
| 11,600 in the Eleventh (mountain) Dis
| trirt, and they have gradually risen to
14,300. I am entirely confident of the
election of the Bryan electors by a small
but safe plurality, which will be shown on
tbe final count. Our people are collect
ing the evidence of these frauds."
As the official returns come in to-night
the statement is confirmed that the elec
toral vote of the State is going to stand
twelve to one. In some counties the head
of the electoral ticket leads the other
twelve by more than 100 votes.
General Simon B. Buckner, the National
Democratic nominee for Vice-President,
spent the evening in tbe Courier-Journal
office to bear the political news, but he
declined to be interviewed.
Major H. P. Johnson, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee, said
to-night that from information in his pos
session he believed the State had given
Bryan 1000 plurality.
At 11 o'clock Chairman Roberts of the
Republican Campaign Committee issued
tut following bulletin:
"Official returns from 100 counties and
reliable unofficial returns from the other
19 counties show that McKiniey has car
ritd Kentucky by between 400 and 500 plu
rality. The official returns on the coun
ties yet to be heard from will not materi
ally change these figures. We shall be
able to announce tbe final figures to-mor
row.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1896.
DUNCE ON BUENA.
VISTA'S SUMMIT
Barbaric Orgies Indulged
In by Hundreds of
Redskins.
Weird Scene in an Aboriginal
Sweathouse Erected on the
Mountain.
HONORING OLD TRADITIONS.
Braves Leap and G ide Before a Huge
Fire Until Overcome by
Exhaustion.
IONE, Cal., Not. 6.â ln response to
some mysterious call or signal the In
dians of this region have been gathering
from hills and valleys for some weeks
past and are now congregated, to tbe
nnmber of several hundred, In a tribal re
union at the base of tbe flat-topped peak
of Buena Vista, a landmark that can be
seen for many miles around. The event
is a sort of census-taking and general
high jinks, and has not taken place before
for many years. The old-timers say that
at the last ereat pow-wow more than 1100
were gathered, so the present number
seems a pointed example of the inevitable
law which has decreed that the Indian
must go.
In the center of the camp is erected a
structure called the sweathouse. a dome
shaped wickiup, the framework of
boughs and vines, covered with a rain and
almost air proof thatch of weeds, mud
and cattails, resembling an immense
mu-krat nest. A sort of tunnel is the
only entrance, and pushing and crowding
one's way through this passage to the in
terior the scene encountered is weird and
fantastic in the extreme. A large fire
burns fiercely in the center, the smoke
hanging thickly from the roof. On
three sides are pacKed tbe bulk
of tbe crowd; on tbe fourth are
tbe old veterans and singers, who
standing in a row, chant a monotonous
sing-song, accompanied by the racket of a
split stick or clapper, all, however, in per
fect time. The dancers, lithe and well
formed young men, nude, except for a
circlet ol buzzard feathers round the
waist and in the hair, their faces painted
wnite and the front of body and limbs
alternately striped with black and white,
elide swiftly round and round the blaze.
The heat is intense ami the floor of the
place becomes wet with the perspiration
that drlpa from their steaming bodies. At
intervals of fifteen minutes they stop,
turn their backs on the crowd, and the
oldest man rises and talks vehemently.
He is interrupted frequently by a wailing
cheer, after which the dance continues.
When a dancer becomes exhausted an
other takes his place.
This pow-wow is to continue five days.
Altogether it is a weird and barbaric
function and seems far removed from tbe
end of the nineteenth century.
A TIE IN THE SENATE.
Sliver Advocates May Block Tariff
Legislation.
NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 6 âThe de
velopments in Congressional contests have
been few, out in one respect they prac
tically demonstrate that the gold forces
will i;il to control the Senate in the Forty
fifth Congress, which control yesterday
was deemed probable. At that time tbe
apparent division of the forces was as fol
lows: Gold Republicans 38, gold Demo
crats 8, total 46; silver Republicans 9, sil
vet Democrats 26, Populists 9, total 44;
majority for gold 2.
One of tbe gold votes in that table was
credited to North Dakota, but it now ap
pears that the Legislature of that State
will elect a free silver advocate to succeed
Senator Hansbrough. To emphasize the
truth of this fact, Mr. Hansbrough, who
made the campaign as a candidate for
Senator, has announced bis withdrawal
from the contest. This will make the
Senate a tie Detween the gold and silver
torces, and should Senator Dubois' asser
tion of last spring â that no financial or
tariff legislation should be accomplished
that did not provide for the free coinage of
silver â remain in force in the next Con
gress and there be no individual changes
of attitude on the subject by Senators,
there is but little livelihood that anything
will be done in that direction for another
two years.
A lew individual changes are to be made
in the list of members of the next House
sent out yesterday by the United Associa
ted Presses, but the total representation
of the several parties is not materially
affected. C. B. Lanriis R. is elected from
tbe Ninth Indiana District instead of J. B.
Cheadle F. ; R. Z. Linney R., from the
Eighth North Carolina District, instead of
R. A. Doughton D. ; J. L. Brenner D.,
from the Tnird Ohio District, instead of
R. M. Nevin R. ; D. K. Watson R., from
the Twelfth Ohio District, instead of J. J.
Lentz D. ; Robert Gamble R., from South
Dakota, instead of Freeman Knowles D. ;
W. H. King D., from Utah, instead of
Lafayette Holbrook Sil.R. ; W. F. Mondell
R., from Wyoming, instead of J. E. Os
born D.

A RAILROAD AGENT'S GUISE.
Conviction Ur.der the Interstate Commerce
Act Before the United States
Supreme Court.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 6â The
case of C. S. Wight, general freight a^ent
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was
areued in ihe Supreme Court to-day.
W.gtu was convicted by a jury of unlaw
fa i discrimination between shippers in
violation of the interstate commerce act.
He : ranted a laic of 3)Â£c per hundred
weight to one Bruening on beer shipped
from Cincinnati to Pittsburg. It was dis
covered through a discharged employe.
Meanwhile the Panhandle Railroa i, un
able to find out where the trouble was,
had cut schedule rates. Its freight agent
was indicted, pleaded guilty and was
fined.
Wight's excuse on trial was that Bruen
ing had a biding on the Panhandle road
and that the Baltimore and Ohio could
not get his business without civing him a
rebate, which was under tbe guise of an
allowance for cartage. The case was ar
gued by Hu.-b L. Bond of Baltimore for
Wight and Edward B. Whitney, Assistant
Attorney-General, for the United States.
All the justices except Justice Field were
present
This is the first criminal conviction of a
railroad officer for unjust discrimination
and the result will be watched by all tbe
shippers and railroad men in the country.

NEARLY ALL DROWNED,
Steamer Tiberias Fatal Col
lision With a Schooner Off
St. Johns.
Thirteen Lives Lost, MikiDg Seven
Wom2n Widows and Thirty-Six
Children Orphans.
ST. JOHNS, N. F., Nov. 6.â The steamer
Tiberia, Captain de Lisle, bound for Syd
ney, left here at 7 o'clock to-night. Ten
minutes later, when just beyond the en
trance to tbe harbor, she collided with the
schooner Maggie, bound from Benavist
Bay for St. Johns with a cargo of fish and
lumber. Thirteen lives were lost.
The schooner carried a crew of nine and
fourteen passeneers, five of whom were
women. The schooner had her lights dis
played, and there was no justification on
the steamer's part for the collision, be
cause the night was clear and the schooner
quite near the shore, in a part of the
entrance where steamers rarely go.
The shock of the collision was awful.
The schooner was struck amidships, cut
in two pieces and sank instantly. All
at>oard were on deck. They were thrown
into the water, and those saved were only
rescued by the help of the floating deck
load of lumber.
Several were caught under tne sails and
dragged down with the sinking vessel.
Others were unable to keop afloat until
the rescue boats arrived and dropped off
the planks. Two men climbed up tbe
steamer's side and seven were saved by
her boats. One woman was also saved,
making ten souls rescued. The other thir
teen, nine men and four women, were
drowned, Captain Blundon's wife, who
was bringing her consumptive 16-year-old
boy to the hospital at St. Johns, was
drowned, although her husband had her
on a plank. The boy was saved. The cap
tain's brother and nephew were also lost.
Two passengers named Holloway, brother
and sister, were 'irowned, as was also
Jnmes Power and his wife. Seven widows
and thirty-six orphans is the result of this
collision.
The pecuniary losses of the survivors
are heavy. Captain Blum! on owned 800
quintils of fish aboard, valued at $3000
Several other men had their summer's
wagesâ s4oC apiece â with them, and two
men had $1000 each and were coming to
St. Johns to make purchases. All were
more or less closely related.
The accident happened within * half a
mile of the town. The steamer lay to
while she sent a boat ashore to land the
survivors and then continued her voyage.
. The police are arranging to cause the
arrest of the TiDeria's crew at Sydney on
a charge of manslaughter. The Govern
ment is caring for the survivors. â¢

WASHINGTON COAL
FOR CALIFORNIA
Great Mining Project in
the Carbon River
Country.
Extensive Bituminous Beds to B
Developed by a Rich
Syndicate.
WILL SUPPLY SAN PJBANCISCO
Confident of Driving Wellington and
Australian Product From the
Market.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. B.âArrange
ments have been made quietly to greatly
increase the coal output of this S ate.
McKinley's election will, it is believed,
hasten tbe consummation of a great coal
mining project that has been under way
for three years. This is the opening of
what promises to be the largest coal mines
in tbe Scate on Carbon River, six miles
southeast of tbe Carbon Hill mines,
owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The property is owned by a rich syndicate,
at the head of which is H. W. McNeill,
formerly general manager of the Oregon
Improvement Company, and Thomas.
Hewitt, a prominent coal expert, who
came to Tacoma last year from the East.
The syndicate has driven a large tunnel
into the mountain side for 600 feet, and
two other tunnels are being excavated.
Eic;ht coal veins have thus been opened,
ranging from four to fifteen feet in width.
One vein contains fine blacksmith coal
and another an excellent grade of semi
bituminous.
As the mines are only six miles distant
from the Noithern Pacific branch to Car
boD Hill, little difficulty will be experi
enced in placing tbe coal on the market.
The syndicate has kept its work and in
tentions as secret aa possible, but it is
understood that it intends shipping to
San Francisco when development work
has proceeded a iittle further. It is also
stated that the company hopes to be able
to drive British Columbia and Australian
coals nut of the California market as soon
as its output becomes large enough.
C. B. Talbqt, a prominent coal expert,
says tne McNeiil coal contains 70 per cent
carbon. He believes it is the best coal yet
discovered on the coa?t south of the Brit
ish Columbia line, and that its quality
will justify active competition with Wel
lington and Australian coals. The North
ern Pacific has just completed coal bunk
â¢ rs of 20,000 tons capacity in Tacoma,
which will iacilitate proposed cargo ship
ment!". It is believed that part of the out
put will be taken by the Canadian Pa
cific Railway.
VISITS MA RE ISLAND.

Sretln of the Station.
VALLEJO, Cal., Nov. 6.â The yard tug
Unadilla left for San Francisco this morn
ing, but broke down and has not yet re
turned to the yard. The Philadelphia
steamed up to the navy-yard this afternoon
and immediately went onto the drydock,
to remain long enough to be scraped and
painted and then to return to San Fran
cisco. Admiral Beardslee remained at the
City and has his quarters at tne Occi
dental. On coming up the stream the flag
of Admiral K.rklaud, commandant of the
yard, was saluted by the firing of guns,
which was answered from the battery on
board the Independence.
Congressman Hilborn, in company with
Assemblyman Anderson, visited the of
ficials at the navy-yard to-day. In the ab
sence of tbe commandant they were re
ceived and entertained by Captain A. 8.
Barcar, acting commandant of the station,
who imparted much valuable information
regarding the wants of the yard. Congress
man Hilborn is in favor of placing the
navy-yard in first-class condition and
should the present chairman of the House
naval committee, Boutelle of Maine, be
selected by the incoming President as Sec
retary of the Navy, Mr. Hilborn, because
of his long service on that committee and
his thorough knowledge of naval affairs,
will, without doubt, be made its chair
man.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 6.â Mall
advices by the steamer Miowera, arriving
to-day from Australia, report that a bril
liant meteor was recently observed in
many parts of Australia. All reports are
similar. The meteor was seen in the
evening at 8 o'clock throughout New
South Wales. It traveled from west to
south, comparatively near the earth. It
was round, and seemed about the size of
the moon when it first appeared. When
it flew across the heavens it became cone
shaped and intensely brilliant and was
ioilowed by a very wide band of fire. The
entire path oi the comet was lJtnminated
for several seconds.
From scores of districts throughout Aus
tralia word comes of destructi n of crops
and grass owing to tbe persistent drought
and great heat. The loss to agricultural
and sheep interests will t>e very heavy.

Deserted a Wife and Two Children
When Pardoned From tlu
Penitentiary.
PORTLAND, Ob., Nov. 6.â A little less
than a year ago Frank Vollens, aged 28
years, a stranger in these parts, obtained
work on the small farm of John Matthias,
near Beaverton. In the Matthias family
were two daughters, aged 21 and 23 years,
respectively, and named Helen and Ger
trude. To these girls Vollens made him
self very agreeable after the cose of a
day's work. Tho young man proved to
possess many accomplishments rarely had
by common laborers. He sang well; he
spoke several languages and had traveled
much. Vollens also had more than a fair
share of good looks and the result was
that three months after he came to that
farm as a hired man he wedded Miss Ger
trude.
Young Mrs. Vollens, to her great amaze
ment, discovered last July that an attach
ment had sprung up between her sister
Helen and Vollens. T.iis both denied
when charged with it, so Gertrude, who
had much confidence in her younger sis
ter, forced herself to believe that she
might have been mistaken.
On Saturday last the young wife became
cognizant of facts that no longer left a
doubt in her mind as to the correctness of
her original impression.
The couple were missed from the ranch
Sunday morning and since then have not
been seen by those interested in them.
Vollens took with him $80 belonging to
his father-in-law.
In his hasty departure from the ranch
he neelected to carry away a pocketbook
of his containing papers shedding li^ht
v pon his identity. These documeuts evi
dence that he was released from the Joiiet
(111.) penitentiary in 1894, where he served
three years for forgery committed in Chi
cago, but was pardoned by Governor Alt
field. They further show his true name to
be Frederick Velleman, and that he has a
wife and two children living in the city
from which he was sent to the State
prison.

vulged by the authorities, but two oi them

lies about Usal and the others are half
breed Indians. All are stock-iaisers.

to-morrow.

BOWERS LEADS
OVER CASTLE
Unofficial Returns Give
Him Two Hundred
Plurality.
The CoDgressman Says There Is
No Basis for Fusion
Claims.
QUEER MUDDLE IN THE SIXTH.
Figures Hay? Become Mixed and Only
the Final Canvass Can
Decide.
. SAN" DIEGO. Cal., >'ov. 6.â The pres
ent indications are that I have over
200 plurality. W. W. BOWERS.
Congressman Bowers is confident that
he is re-elected, basinp bis belief on al
most compiete but unofficial returns from
the Seventh District. There was a big
jollification meeting at Cbula Vista last
night and the Congressman was there,
but before leaving San Diego he was in
terviewed /or The Call regarding his
chances.
"I have figures from friends all over the
district," be said, "which show that I am
elected by 213 at least, with all precincts
beard from. The figures compiled in San
Francisco, which give Castle 227 plurality
over me. are wronc. I have over 200 sure
and ex peci over 300. One thing to be re
membered is that Castle's name was on
the/iicket twice, and many Populists, be
lieving thej' were required to vote twice
for Castle in order to complete tbe fu-ion,
put cros-es opposite his name in both
places where it appeared on the ticket,
thus invalidating' their vote. The elec
tion boards in tbe rural districts counted
Castle's name twice where two votes had
been cast in this fashion, and I have a
record of over 100 votes iv San Diego
County alone that were counted for (Jastle
in this manner. Of course these will be
thrown out next week wben the official
count is made."
The returns compiled in San Francisco,
to wbich Congressman Bowers refers, give
Castle 19,271 and Bowers 19,156, with thir
teen precincts to bear from. It is be
lieved Mr. Bowers bases his claim upon
unofficial advices from these precincts.
The situation in the Sixth District is
peculiar. The fusionists claim Barlow's
election, and McLacblan concedes it,
while the Republican committee returns
give the Pasadenan the victory. The re
turns have got mixed in some manner,
and the result will be known beyond
doubt only when the ballots are can
vassed by the Election Commissioners.
The returns compiled in San Francisco,
ni>on which the iuÂ«rton confidence rests,
give McLachlan 23,523 and Barlow 23,613.
with but one precinct unreported.
Yesterday's returns decreased Mc-

BITTER TOWARD ITHITE.
Democrat* Claim Hi* Combine With
< alnr JLo*t the State to Bryan.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 6 âMany
local Democrats attribute the defeat of
tluir party in this Slate to the selfish
combine of Senator White and T. V.
Cator to control the Legislature and effect
the return of the one and the election of
the other to the United States Senate.
White's failure to elect Jones as State
Senator in his own district is pointed to
as an evidence of the Senator's waning
fortunes in the politics of California.
White, it is said, was warned of tbis re
sult unless be kept aloof from Cator, but
he turned a deaf ear to all friendly ad
monitions. No man can convince a num
ber of leading Democrat's hereabouts but
that the defeat of the Bryan electors of
Caiilornia is not trnceable directly to the
W hite-Cator alliance.
Trinity Go"* Itetnoeratic.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Nov. 6.â Eighteen
precincts out of twenty-three in Trinity
County t;ive McKiniey 477. Bryan 491, Palmer

Trinity County by 20 plurality. The same
precincts give Barhain R. for Congress 397,
Cuiler F. 403, Montelth Ind. 18. Seven
teen precincts give Houghton F. for the As
sembly 422, Matlock R. 423. The remaining
preciucu will probably give Houghton about
20 majority, so he will carry the county by
about 19. The contest for Superior Judg^ Is
very close, with the chances favorable to 'I. E.

THE PALACE AT XANADU.
A Bit From Marco Polo That Inspired
a Famous Poem.
And when you have ridden three days
from the city last mentioned, between
northeast and north, you come to a city
called Chanda, which was ouilt by the
Knan now reigning. There is at this
place a very fine marble palace, tbe rooms
of which ate all gilt and painted with lit;
urea of men and beasts and birds and
with a variety of trees and Sowers, all ex
ecuted with such exquisite art that you
regard them with delight and astonish
ment.
Round Ibis palace a wall is built, in
closing a compass of sixteen miles, and
inside the park there are fountains and
rivera and brooks, and beautiful meadows
wiib all kinds of wild animal- (excluding
such as are of ferocious nature), which
the Emperor has procured and placed
there to supply food for his gerfalcons
and hawks, which he keeps here in mew.
Of these there are more than 200 gerfal
cons alone, without reckoaing the oilier
hawks. The Kaan himsell goes every
weefc to see his birds sitting in mew, and
sometimes he rides through ihe park with
a leopard beh'nd him on his horse's croup;
and then if be sees ><ny animal (hat takes
bis fancy, he slips his leopard at it, and
the game when taken is made over to feed
the hawks in mew. This he does for di
version.
Moreover, at a spot \n thÂ« park where
there is a charming wood, be has another
palauce built of cane, of which I must give
you a description. It is gilt all over and
most elaborately finished inside. It is
stayed on eilt and lackered columns, on
each aide of which is a dragon all gilt, the
tail of wuich is attached to the column,
while the bead supports the architrave
and the claws likewise are stretched out
right and left to support tbe architrave.
The roof, like the rest, is formed of
canes, covered with a varnish so strong
and excellent that no amount of rain will
rot them. These canes are a good three
palms in girth and from ten to fifteen
paces in length. They are cut across at
each knot, and then the pieces are split so
us to form from each two hollow tiles, and
with these the house is roofed ; only, every
such tile of cane has to be nailed down
to prevent the wind from lifi ing it In
short, the whole palace is built of these
canes, wbich sarve also for a great variety
of 01 her useful purposes. The construc
tion of tbe palace is so devised that it
can be taken down and put up again with
great celerity, and it can all be taken to
pieces and removed whithersoever the
Emneror may command. When erected
it i* braced airainst mishaps from the
wind by more than 200 cords 01 silk.â

Marked Improvement in
Trade and Financial
Circles.
Gold Withdrawn From Hiding
Piaces and Put Into
Circulation.
REJOICING IN ALL SECTIONS.
McKinUy's Election. Will Be Ratified
in Many Cities and Towns
To-Night.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 6.-The
marked improvement in business already
noticeable in this city as a 'result of Mc-
Kinley's election and the maintenance of
the country's honor and credit is an ex
tremely significant forerunner of what
may be expected in trade circles in the fu
ture. An air of enterprise and business
prosperity is everywhere apparent. The
return of ant< -election withdrawals from
the banks has been very marked yester
day and to-day. Ail the bankers here ex
pected this result, but they are greatly
surprised at the number of the deposits
made during the past forty-eight hours.
Building and real-estate circles are also
feeling the effects of returning confidence.
Tradein almost every line has greatly im
proved, while the future is full of promise
for better times in every department of
commerce and manufacture.
H. W. Hellman of the Farmers' and
Merchants' Bank, said to-iiay: "A great
deal of toid, which was locked up by timid
people in safe deposit vaults, is again
flowing back into its natural channel in
banking-houses, where it belongs. Our
late dispatches from the East show a very
healthy feeling as regards the future.
Bonds and gilt-edged stocks have, since
the election, gone up from 2 to 5 per cent.
All business men, irrespective oi party,
concede that it was beat, for all that Major
McKinley should be the victor in tbe
great struggle. I am confident that Cali
fornia's wants will be looked into thor
oughly, and that what we are entitled to
we shall receive. We should be very pros
perous in this end of the State, for our
orange, raisin and other industries will be
protected."
"We are all happy," said Abraham
Jacoby, president of the Board oi Trade.
"There is no need of my saying anything.
Here is a dispatch ju>.t sent out" :
William McKinley, Canton, Ohio: The busi
ness mi-n of Los Angeles ex:eud their heart
felt congratulations on trie mngniticeni vic
tory of law, order, sound money and pro
tection.
H. J. Woollncott of the Security Bank
*aid : '"Money is flowing into the b.mks
from tbe safe deposits. There is an air of
confidence that means much to the people
here at home."
H. W. Frank, president of the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers* Association,
said : 4> The principal effec; of the election
is* restoration of confidence. I believe
that ibe Republican party will matte
every effort to keep the pledges in its
platform, and that the cause of bimetal
lism, with all the safeguards of honor
thrown around it, will be furthered. I
believe McKinley will make history for
us. He is a man of firm convictions, and
will be as true to the workinuman as to
tbe capitalist -a faithful servant ot the
American people."

tainment was the whitewashing of a ton

wager on the election. The job was done
in a scientific manner, while numerous
friends tendered eratuitons advice on the
manner in which it. should be done, each
piece of coal being christened after some
popular Bryanite.
The leading attraction was a wheel
barrow ride that was given by a promi
nent State official to a local merchant.

in tbe line. Tbe ratification demonstrated

OVERBOARD OFF OAPE HORN.
Daring; Deed of au Officer of a British
Su-aiiish p.
Most extraordinary are the details of the
gallant action for which an Albert medal
of tbe first class was conferred on Thomas
Averett Whistler, first mate of tbe ship
Ennemale, of LiverpooL
Early in the morning of December 17,
I>Bs, when tbe Ennerdale was rounding
Cane Horn, an apprentice named Duncan
McCallum was sent aloft to loosen tbe
skysail. The Enncrdale, I should men
tion, was one of J. D. Newton's Dale line
of steamers.
Presently, as tbe captain was descend
ing from the poop, ho saw a heavy body
strike the main rigging a little above tbe
bulwark and rebound into the sea. That
"heavy boly" was McCalluiu, and the ship
being almost under full sail at tbe time,
he was carried rapidly astern.
Immediately after this tragic occurrence
H. S. Pocbin, an able seaman, leaped over
board after the apprentice, but the latter
sank before Pochin could reach him. All
things considered the rescuer's position
was now pretty serious, and, fearing lest
be sbou.d be seized with cramps before a
boat could come to his assistance, he
baiied the ship, asking for a lifebuoy to be
thrown to him. At the same moment tbe
master, Captain Gunson, called all hunds
to man a boat. The first mate, Mr. Whis
tler, who hau been asleep in his berth, ran
on deck and beard Pocbin's haiL Calling
to tbe boatswain to heave him a lifebuoy
be at once sprang overboard, secured tbe
lifebuoy which was thrown to him and
succeeded in reaching Pochin. This poor
man wa- already on the point of sinking,
but with tbe help oi the lifebuoy Whistler
was able to keep him up.
Meanwhile considerable delay had oc
curred in tbe dispatch of the boat â for one
thine, her lashings had been secured very
firmly for tbe passage round Cape Horn,
and when she was launched so many men
crowded into her that she capsized, wbich
Â«ays much for the popularity of Whistler.
The boat was soon righted,* however, and
dispatched in charge of toe third mate
and two seamen. All this time tbe two
men in the water were rapidly becoming
exhausted, and they had made up their
minds to abandon tbe lifebuoy and strike
out side by side for the snip, wben they
were confronted by a new, weird danger.
An immense albatross swept down ma
jestically on Pocbin and Whistler, and,
alter hovering round quite close to their
heads, alighted on the water pst beyond
arm's length. There the great bird re
mained, staring them in the face, and
evidently only waiting until they ad be
come a little more exhausted. In a few
minutes, however, tbe boat reached the
spot, and its crew drew their perishing
shipmates out of the water. Directly they
were lifted into the boat both men became
insensible, and Whistler was delirious for
some time afterward. Amazing as it may
seem, the two men bad remained in tbe
piercingly cold water for upward of forty
minutes. The expectant albatross was
reatly disappointed at tÂ» c turn events
had taken, and had to be driven off with
a boathook. it was a remarkable fact that
tho attack of this bird contributed not a
little to the saving of the lives of both
Wnistler ainl Pocbin. This was because
their vigorous efforts to beat off the sav
age bird materially helped to keep their
Mood in circulation, thereby averting the
fatal cramp.â Strand Masrazine.
MEN WHO DO HOESES' WORK.
A -"Million Japanese Engaged in Full
ing Jlnrikishas.
One of if not the greatest obsracle in the
way of the industrial progress of Japan is
the fact that upward of 1,000,000 of the
most muscular of its population are en
gaged as beast 3of burden. In tbis calcu
lation I do not include those occupations
in which the day laborers of all civilized
countries are engaged. The statement is
simply based on tbe fact that over 1,000,
-000 of the vigorous manbood are engaged
in the transportation of people and com
modities from place to place, performing
the wort which in Europe and America is
done by animals, by steam, by electricity
and other modern methods oi conveyance.
So tremendous is this drain upon the pop
ulation of the empire that much of the
other hard labor, such as loading coal on
vessels, handling heavy freiuht on rail
ways, tbe driving and loading of paefc
borses, heavy fa-ni work and the like, is
performed by women, who, dressed in
tight b!ue cotton trousers and tunics, are
compelled to do for Japan what the Jong
shoremen, yardmen and farm laborers do
in the United States.
1 he estimate that over 1,000,000 men are
engaged in tbe Mikado's empire in these
degra ling occupations is i>ased upon the
fan that the returns of 1895 u how a total
of 199,411 jinrikishas ami 914 840 band
carts. As all these carriages and carts are
licensed, tbe returns are probably correct,
in the case of tUe jinrikiahaa tbe number
of pullers and pushers is greatly in excess
of the number of vehicles. This comes
from the fact that some of the vehicles
have two men, and because in larpe cities
the same vehicle is rented out during the
twenty-four ours to two different men.
It is safe to assume that nearly 250,000
coolies are directly and indirectly engaged
as pullers and pusiiers of the-e convey
ances. As for carts, the same holds true.
They are propelled with enormous loads,
sometimes by two bent and wrinkled old
men, sometimes by one strong and hearty
young man of low intelligence, and some
times by mere boys, from 15 to 18 years of
age. One million, therefore, would seem
to be within the mark. This gives us a
total of 1,250,000 human horses.
To the ordinary observer these jinriki
shas seem a novel and delightful experi
ence. They combine all the joys of a
human horse. They heip you into the
carriage, hand you your parasol or um
brella, tuck ihe rug around you, and land
you at the door of the shop or house.
Moreowi, they take care of your parcels.
In rainy weal her they pull up the hood
ana fasten ihe oilcloih in front, so that
nothing but a peephole is left, ana you
are safe from the wet and mud. Ail you
see is the bare legs of the hedgehce
lookin>Â» creature who, covered with a pe
culiar hat and coat of a reedy grass, is
rushing onward thronsjh slush and snow
and sleet and rain. This is well enough
for the passenger within, but what are
the effects of tbe occupation upon the
man without? What is the effect of the
employment of 1,250,000 of the robust men
ol Japan in this wav and in the hauling
of carts upon the rest of the population?
These are questions that must be care
fully weighed in any estimate of the fu
ture industrial importance of Japan. â

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
6. â The Stanford baseball nine met with
defeat at the hands of the Tufts-Lyons
team of Los A:igeies this afternoon by a
score of 2.0 1. The Stanford players feel
very much gratified that their defeat was
. not worse, for none of the nine had touched
a baseball for several months. The visit
ors met with a warm reception and their
play and conduct generally here made
them many .friends. Throughout the
k game there was plenty of cheering and
several excellent plays elicited bursts of
applause. McLaine, Stanford's Varsity
pitcher for several seasons, was in the box
. for the borne learn, and it was largely to
his twirling of the sphere and his support
by Catcher Clarence Strohn that Stanford
can attribute her good showing.
At 2 o'clock the visitors went to the bat,
â  the make-up of the twot-.ams being as fol

In the second inning both sides man

his base on balls. Wolfskill struck out.
Franck made a sacrifice hit and brought
in Farow. Tufts knocked a pop fly to

For Stanford Ruddell and R. Strohn
â¢ were unable to reach first. Thompson
excited the audience by knocking a two
bagger and when McLaine hit, safely
bringing the runner in, the crowd was in
biah glee. No more runs were piled up,
â  however, by the college men.
Both sides failed to score in the fourth,
but fortune favored the southern boys in
â  the fifth. Tufts hit to Sharpe and reached
first in safety. Longhead got the only
three-base hit of the day. This bou^nt
in Tufts. The score remained 2to 1 the
â¢ rest of the game. .
In the ninth the visitors tried hard to
run up the score. By three safe hits they
managed to fill the bases. McLaine struck
out LouKbeed. Harvey hit an easy fly to
Wight. Cummings Knocked a difficult

SHE RAISES FRUIT.
Conquest of Mrs. Thomas Fraser at
Banning on the Colorado
Desert.
Mrs. Captain Thomas F. Fraser, owner
and manager of a large fruit ranch at
Banning, on tne edge of the big Colorado
desert, is at the Commercial. The lady is
on her way East, to cet some improved
machinery for next year's handling of the
fruit and also to make arrangements to
ship the crop direct to the Eastern market.
This year Mrs. Fra-er had five carloads
of dried fruit. For the first two cars she
received 3 cr>nts a pound and for the re
mainder $14 cents. The fruit consisted of
prunes and was ungraded.
Mrs. Fraser is the widow of Captain
Fraser, for a number of years superintend
ent of the Lick estate. He also superin
tended the construction of the .Lick Ob-

servatory. They owned a ranch in tbe
mountain pass at Banning when Captain
Fraserdied. It had been largely planted
in trees and these trees, during the last
year or two, have begun bearing in
abundance.
Left with the management of the ranch
Mrs. Fraser at once took hold of it in
earnest, and she has attended to all the
details ever since. It is no easy ta-k, for
the ranch consists of about 200 acres. Of
this eigbty-five acres are in prunes, thirty
in small fruit and the remainder in alfalfa
and grain.
It is the first, however, that is the profit
able crop, and the one which receives the
lady's greatest attention. The crop prom
ises to prove a steady bonanza.
Mrs. Fraser told about her experiences
yesterday to a Call representative. She
said that though the ranch produced five
cars of dried fruit this year it wa3 really
the beginning. Many of the trees were
ju^t getting ready to bear, an<i next year
and afterward, as she says, there will be
very large yields.
She also told about the profits of fruit
raiding, and said she was entiiely sati-ried
in thi* way.
"Though the profits are not so big as
they used to be," said she, "still there is
money in the business. It is really a
business. 1 refer now particularly to the
raiding of prunes and drying them. The
prune crop is the one of which I have the
most, though I have a variety of plums
and other small fruit.
"As the ranch is comparatively new I
have not yet built drvbousee, trays and
tbe apparatus generally used. However,
at Banning the air is hot and dry, and dry
houses are not really needed. Not having
trays, I cut forty acres of alfalfa just be
fore beginning the curing of she prunes
and spread them out on tbe alfalfa ground.
i found this worked very well.
"JSut I will now make arrangements for
trays, so that I will have them next year.
While J am East I will also get other ap
paratus that is necessary in carrying on a
fruit ranch. Besides this, I want, if I can,
to sell the crop in the East, shipping
direct, so as to avoid the payment of com
missions. I think this is the real way to
market a California crop.
"Banning, where the ranch is, is a pretty
place five hours' ride from Yuma, in the
edge of the great Colorado desert. It is
the first green spot reached after passing
the desert. It is 2300 feet above the level
of the sea, and many invalids go there be
cause of the fine, dry air.
"The little town of some 300 people oc
cupier, a pass between ban Jacinto Moun
tain and Grayback Mountain. On these
| picturesque mountains snow may be seen
all the year. I like fruit-raising very
much. It is an independent business and
I find no difficulty in carrying it, O n.
"I employ Indian and Mexican labor
largely and huve no trouble at all. In the
height of the picking season I employed
thirty-five men, women and children
Next year probably double as many will
be required."
Mrs. Fraser is an object lesson to timid
people who are afraid to launch into inde
pendent enterprises for fear of failure
She will be in the City only a few days.
Charged Extra for His Injuries.
At the barber's:
"A shave, sir?"
"Yes. (The operation was performed
more or less clumsily.) How much?"
"One shilling."
"Dear me! 1 thought you only charged
sixperce."
"Yes, for an ordinary shave; but this
time 1 happened to cut you and had to
apply an astringent lotion to stop the
blendingâ that makes sixpence extra." â

Hotel bright and early yesterday morning
to interview the sailor's next opponent.
He was accompanied by Groom and Gibbs!
the managers of the National Club. After
the customary introductions and exchange
of compliments, bu-iness was inoruer. In
the drawing up of the articles of agree
ment some discussion was nad over time
keepers, but this question was quickly ad
ju-ted. Each fighter was ailowed one,
the club selecting a third. So far as sec
onds were concerned, tne managers agreed
upon three each. Julian was very anxious
as to the $10,000 purse. He -a"id that it
should be in the hands of somebody satis
factory to both principals ten days before
i' day of the fight. Groom thought that
th exaction of Manager Julian was too
se.eie on the club, as it had already de
po-ited $5000 in t.ie keeping of a morning
paper, wmch should be ample guarantee
of the club's good faith in the matter.
Julian, a'ter cnnrderahle rnr!>>y. a^re^'i

finally to a proposition that the purse in
full must be in the hands of the stake
holder at 2 o'clock of the afternoon of the
evening of the contest. Lynch agreed to
this and nothing more wai said regarding
the money part of the agre ment.
Fitzsimmons, who was reclining in a
soft-seated chair, a very attentive listener
to the conversation that resulted between
the managers, suggested something about
gloves.
"What kind of gloves does Sharkey pro-
Dose to use?" asked the Cornishman of
Manager Lynch.
"Why, any Kind of mittens will satisfy
Tom," retorted the horseman.
"Well, any kind of gloves won't snit
me," answered Fitz. "My hands are of a
peculiar formation and I require a special
make of Klove." And the fighter held out
his mighty right duke which had sent
many a good man to dreamland.
Lynch looked surprised at the mam
moth weapon of defense and after a short
pause he agreed that the fighters select
their own gloves.
Groom, who was figuring in the club's
interest during the hand and glove dis
cussion, asiced Julian and Lynch what
they proposed doing to guarantee their ap
pearance in the ring.
"How much do you want us to ad
vance?" asked Julian.
Groom thought that $2500 each would be
reasonable.
Julian looked at Lynch and Lynch
in tnrn peeped at Fitzsimmons.
"Well, you know that we have $6000
posted in New York for a match with
Corbett," said Julian, "and it will take
some time to get it.
Lynch said that his money was tied up
with Corbett, but he thought he couid
raise $2500.
Both managers finally agreed to post a
forfeit on the proviso that the money be
paid to the contestant who enters the ring
prepared to fight, and that it both princi
pals failed to appear the money then
houlu" be turned over to the club.
Julian and Groom took a trip to Sausa
lito yesterJay with a prospect of securing
raining quarters for Fitzsimmons.
Julian was delighted witn the place and
will go over ayain to-day to rent
1 cottage for his charge. Fitz is a great
â  over of domestic simplicity and does not
ike to eat any article of fooa not prepared
r>y his wife.
The San Francisco Yacht Club has
â .liven the pugilist the privilege of making
use of its commodious quarters anytime
tie sees fit. This is very acceptable to him,
;s he takes great pleasure in both rowing

CONVICTS TOOK LEAVE,
lames Nash and Beecher
Manson Quietly Skulk
Away.
hÂ°y Are Mourned by the Guards
at the House oi Cor
rection.
When the "rinsr-in" bell sounded at the
House of Correction Thursday afternoon
wo of Suj erintendent Reddy's most
worthy wards failed to put in an appear
uice.
The missing ones are James Nash and
tSeecher Manson, both of whom have been
â¢erving short terms for petty larceny.
They had just entered upon the first month
f a 180-day sentence, after which Nash
was to fill another six-month engagement
Mi a conviction of vagrancy.
These two prisoners were regarded with
n unusually watchful eye when they were
Am taken to the "house," tor they had
previous records in other jails for more
-. s.'gravated offenses. Under the name of
â¢ iiaries Watson, Beecher Manson was
onvicted in San Bernardino County a
ouple of years ago and duly served a
velve-month term in the warm belt. He
s Out a iati, not yet out of his teens, but
iie is a very "tou.-h" character.
Under the care of Guards Donnelly and
Herrington they went to work Thursday
ifterncon in the vegetable patch outside
he prison walls. The watchful eye that
:nd been kept upon them up to that time
-*rew hazy after nights of wakefulness

during election times. Guard Donnelly
nusted to Guard Herrington while he al
lowed the lid to drop over his optics half
tbe watch, and v;ce versa, but as Herring
ton was calculating the same wav the
vice versa miscarried and tne watchful
eve k(>pt warm in total oblivion of what
w.im transpiring about it.
Not so with the peepers of Nash and
Manson. Their wide-awake optics, re
freibened an>l invigorated by weeks of
early retiring, detected the opportunity
for escape, and they availed themselves
of it.
Now they are at laige, and Captain
Lees' force of detectives is out on a still
hunt, assisted by the House of Correction
n^rd". hoping to â  ather them in.
A NEW CHARTER
MAY BE DRAWN
Special Elections May Be
Called at Any
Time.
Attorney Creswell Discovers a
Late and Vital Supreme
Court Case.
NO NEED OF FOUR YEARS' DEI AY
If the People Want a NÂ«w Organic
Law There Is Nothing in
Their Way.
City and County Attorney Creswell has
discovered that there has been a recent
decision of the Supreme Court â Septem
ber 21 â by which a special election may
be held at any time for the purpose of
adopting a new charter.
"A year ago the Election Commission
and many leading lawyers did not hold
this view," said Mr. Creswell last night,
"but, on the authority of the people
against Hoge, hÂ«Â»ld that the only time
that a charter could be submitted would
be at a general election as distinguished
from an election called specially to submit
puch a question. It was held that the
smcial election meant by the law was one
to fill a vacant office.
"But the Supreme Court decided in Sep
tember, in the case of the People ex rel
Miller and Hughes vs. D.i\ie etal., thnt
amendments to the Oakmnd charter were
proierly adopted at an election called
snecsally for that purpose. The court
construes the eleventh section of the
eighth article of the constitution, where
the expression, 'special or general elec
tion,' occurs, and holds that the decision
in People vs. Hoge, so far as it touches the
question of construine those expressions,
is obit<T dictum. In other words, in plain
En.'iish, a special election may be called
at any time for submission of a new
charter."
STRATEGY OP TEE TURTLE.
It Eats Â» Variety of : Things and
Skirmishes Lively for Them.
The snapping turtle eats a variety of
things; when it gets a chance it catches
and eats live fish, usually killfish, says
the New York Sun. While the turtle is a
pretty fair swimmer in its way, It cannot
begin to compete with the fish; it cap
tures the fish by strategy.
When the tide comes in killfish come up
the creeks in swarms, looking for food.
The kllfish is a scavenger; it will eat al
most anything. Any scrap of food on the
wa;er is fastened upon, perhaps by one
kill or by ten, or there may be a hundred
killies struggling and positing to get at it,
and tearing off shreds and fragments
whenever tney reach it. This is the tur
tle's opportunity.
The turtle, standing in the shallow water,
edjes toward the nearest itilli, moving
slowly and cautiously with its neck ex
tended. As it moves nearer it gradually
contracts its neck, drawing its head back
toward its shell. Its body in all the time
petting closer to the kiili, but its head is
not. The killi, If it has an eye on the
turtle at all, is thus lulled into false se
curity. It seenn never to realize tbe tele
scope character of the turtle's neck.
The turtle calculates distanc a with great
nicety. Stili inching steadily iorward it
keeps all the time dialing in its head,
until perhaps only its eyes are visible peer
ing out from under the edge of its shell.
ThÂ«'n, when it is within striking distance,
suddenly out shoots its head, and oftener
than not it gets the killi.
There is a sheilfish In the Mediterranean
which produces a pool quality of silk.
Fabrics have been manufactured from it,
but only .-is curiosities.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
To-night we jubilate.
California has a right to crow.
It is the day for industry to rejoice.
It was the greatest victory on record.
Shout for triumphant Republicanism.
Capital is coming out of hiding and
labor has its opportunity.
The fusion managers are all agreed it
was the other fellow's fault.
The town to-night will be as radiantly
rosy as the bright dawn of prosperity.
Every citizen will share in the good
times, and ali should share in the jubilee.
Senator Teller will not talk of fusion in
the future â the Colorado bolter has bad
enough.
Congratulations to Alameda; the proud
banner of California Republicanism is
hers again.
From this time on every week will see
higher levels reached by the rising tide of
prosperity.
Bryan ism may be relieved by the gold
cure, but for Altgeldism there is no re
course but the madhouse.
It won't be long now before we will be
talking about carnivals and lrohcs of that
kind to lighten up the winter.
Now that money is in no danger it
comes out, circulates among the people
and takes an interest in enterprises.
The election of McKinley has restored
confidence, and we shall soon nave abun
dant evidencen of restored prosperity.
If Dan Laniont would exert his noted
tact and get Cleveland to cut his message
short the people would take it kindly.
Give vent to your joy to-nigiit. The
victory has been gloriously won, and
loyal Republicans have a right to cele
brate it.
It is agreed on all sides that the present
system of voting needs a good deal of
alteration. It is too clumsy for the Ameri
can people.
Winter has already become a frozen fact
In some parts of tne East in spite of the
almanac, and the people are getting out
their skates.
The President is ours, the Senate is
ours, the House is ours, the State is ours,
and tbe country is with vs â so wbat more
can we wish?
Business waited on politics, and now
politics has done the proper tiling by
making the way clear for business for four
years to come.
Bourke Cockran says "the Democratic
party has no future which it can deter
mine for itself," and that seems to be
about the size of it.
There should be an extra session of
Congress as soon as McKinley takes his
Eeat. We cannot get rid of the deficit
tariff any too quickly.
The whirr of running mills and the
bum of active industry make the music
that carries eladness into every heart and
hrigiitens every home.
Winter is coming, but it will not be a
winter of discontent in any part of tbe
Union. There will be work for tne
workers and wages in good gold.
The jubilee to-night will be something
more than the celebration of a party vic
tory. It will be a popular festival in
honor of the restoration of better times.
It is safe to say that McKinley'g ad
ministration will so far restore National
prosperity as to give aatisiaction to tbe
people, and that the Republican party has
virtually entered upon power for the rest
of this generation.
The cau?e of silver is safe In the hands
of the Republican party, and the Mcr
Kiniey administration can be counted
on to carry out the party pledge to pro
mote the free coinage of silver by inter
national agreement.
The value of raw silk imported into this
country last year was $22.. 000, 000, while the
value of silk goods imported was $31,000,
-, 000. In these figures there is evidence of
a chance for California to buildup a big
industry in the silk business.
Bear in mind McKinley's words, "The
â victory is not to a party or to a section,
but of and for the whole American
peeople." In the spirit of that sentiment
let us all turn out this evening and make
the celebration an occasion of general re
joicing.
A New York reporter thought it worth
while to ask Mr. Hanna whether the
tariff had anything to do with the resnlt
ol the election, and it is scarcely necessary
to say Mr. Hanna smiled blandly and
told him the tariff had very much to do
with it.
Every business interest which depends
on confidence in the Government has been
benefited by the election of McKinley,
and as a consequence the welfare of the
country was promoted by the Republican
success on Tuesday to an extent which it
would be hard to overrate and almost
impossible to estimate.
CELEBRATE THE VICTORY.
The State Central Committee, through
its chairman, Frank McLaughlin, has sent
to all the county committees a telegram
recommending that a celebration and rati
fication of the glorious victory achieved
by the Republican part;.' be held through
out the State this evening. It is scarcely
necessary to say the recommendation will
be adopted. To-night victorious Republi
canism will paint the State red. It will be
a veritable jubilee to mark the end of the
long depression and the dawning of a
new era of prosperity.
The celebration in the State will have its
highest and fullest accomplishment in
this City. This would be in the natural
order of things, as San Francisco is the
metropolis of the State. There are other
reasons, however, than those of population
and wealth which will emphasize the pre
eminence of our celebration to-night. In
this City loyal Republicans and conserva
tive Democrats have snatched victory from
the very jaws of defeat. The triumph
Here has been one of the most remarkable
in the Union, and those who took part in
the fight have more than ordinary reason
for rejoicing in the victory.
When we remember how much the elec
tion of McKinley means to the people of
San Francisco we can well understand
why her men of business and of industry
should rejoice in the success of their party.
We shall now have protection for our in
dustries, reciprocity treaties which will
build up our foreign trade and wisa legis
lation to promote our merchant marine.
San Franciaco, guarded at home and ad
vanced abroad, will rapidly increase in
population, wealta and prestige. Her
growth during the coming decade is sure
to be great, and we w:ll celebrate to-night
not so much a partisan victory as the
dawning of a new epoch in our civic nis
tory.
While the men who worked and voted
for the Republican ticket have the best
right to rejoice in the victory, in a certain
sense all citizens have some reason for do
ing so. Even those who voted for Bryan
can see now in the renewed confidence of
capital and labor and in the increased ac
tivity of business that they have profited
by their defeat, and not less than their
Republican antagonists will reap benefits
from the revival of industry.
Let everybody come forth, therefore, and
take part in the rejoicing. Let the flaji of
the Nation fly, drums beat and rockets
soar. Let the long procession of victori
ous Republicans march through the streets
in triumph, amid the acclamations of
thousands. Let every man give vent to
his joy, his enthusiasm and his patriot
ism. Let the workingmen of San Fran
crÂ»co who voted as they marched last
Saturday march now as they voted last
Tuesday. Let it be made a great pop
ular demonstration â an ovation from all
who Jove America to those who fought
the good fight for her industries and kept
the faith of her law and her destinies.
A MODERN PHARISEE.
The Chronicle indulged yesterday morn
ing in a lengthy, labored and disingenuous
attempt to explain away its disloyalty to
the Republican party, and relieve itself
ot deserved odium for the defeat of cer
tain of its local candidates and the dimin
ution of its majority upon the general
ticket throughout the State.
The very elaboration of the Chronicle's
defense argues its necessity and justifies
the general opinion of Republicans that
but for its treason no candidate would
have been defeated, no majority dimin
ished and no defense required.
The public is entirely famiiiar with the
facts wnich place the Chronicle upon the
defensive in the matter of its loyalty to the
Republican party and to its regu
lar nominees. The threshing of old
straw by which it attempted to divert
tee eye of honest scorn was as needless
as it will be unavailing. When the Re
publican State Central Committee de
clared that the municipal ticket which ex
isted by virtue of the Chronicle's support
was irregular and had no right or title to
parly recognition ; when the Registrar re
fused to place such irregular ticket upon
file or give it position upou his official
ballot; when the Supreme Court of Cali
fornia approved and upheld the de
cision of tae Registrar; when by virtue
of these decisions by the supreme
appellate tribunals of the party and of the
State all past issues as to tho regularity of
the party organisations were set at rest,
then, if not before then, the defection and
disloyalty of the Chronicle became a
political crime.
Uurine the last thirty days of the cam
paign it devoted the main energies of its
editorial and local staff to sustaining
and encouraging the candidacy of a
straggling company of irregulars who
from the outset knew perfectly that they
had not the slightest chance of success.
Even to these the Chronicle, with habitual
unfaith, could not be true, for it basely
and inconsistently deserted Asa R. Wells
to support "William A. Deane, and thereby
contributed sufficiently to the latter's de
feat The effect of such an element of
disloyalty and disorder in a campaign has
by the result been made only too plain,
and to this portion of the public indict
ment the Chronicle has been too com
pletely made conscious of its own guilti
ness to attempt a defense.
M'KINLEY'S COUNSEL.
The telegram of President-elect McKin
ley to Mr. Hanna, published in The Call
yesterday, carries with it an assurance of
prosperity to all the people of the Union.
Ii makes clear the fact that our coming
President has a true understanding of the
forces which bore him to the great victory
he has won and that he well comprehends
wnat the people expect of him and hope
for from his administration.
Mr. McKinley very truly says: "The
victory is not to a party or to a section,
but of and for the whole American
people." It has been a triumph of the
conservatism of the country, an unmis
takable evidence that business men and
workingmen are opposed to any lurther
experiments in legislation and desire a re
turn to those safe principles of protection
and sound money under which we have
found prosperity in tne past and a return
to which is tne safest way of establishing
onr welfare in the future.
It is pleasing to note that the victory
has been won not as that of one class of
people over another, nor as that of one
section of the country over another. It
has been a victory for the whole people
and the whole Union. It has been a dem
onstration that every class of our citizens
and every portion of our great Republic is
sufficiently able to maintain justice and
business even amid the excitements of a
Presidential election, after the harassing
and disturbing condition of three years of
hard times. As Mr. McKinley says, the
people "have indeed again consecrated
themselves to country and baptized the
cherished ordinances of free government
with a new and holy patriotism."
Most important to us at this juncture is
the counsel given in the closing paragraph
of the letter of the President-elect: "Let
us as Americans straightway devote our
selves to the upbuilding of America; to
the peace, honor and glory of our com
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JNO V KMISJUK 7, isjju.
mon country. Party dissensions should
no longer divide or rack the public mind,
nor the zeal or temper of either side deter
any citizen from patriotic devotion to the
good of all."
Tnese words of guidance should be cor
dially followed. We celebrate to-night the
grand triumph of the patriotism of the
people as illustrated by the Republican
party and the sound money Democrats
who supported McKinley, and in that
celebration if will be well for all citizens
to take part. We have done with the
tights and antagonisms of the past. The
prosperity of the future awaits us all. Let
us unite and work for it together with a
clear understanding that the interests of
all classes and of all sections of the Union
are one and the same.
INFAMOUS JOURNALISM.
Against the ordinary exploits of the new
journalism the individual citizen has protec
tion to this extent, at least, that he can keep
its hideous emanations out of his own house,
and can likewise avoid them, in his daily
movements around town, even as he avoids
other forms of filth. But aerainst one method
of attack known to these unrelenting enemies
of pood government and public morals the
citizen is powerless; his home, his family, hiÂ»
property, are alike defenseless.
With the above paragraph the New
York Sun began an editorial, bearing the
title "An Infamous Cartoon," denouncing
the course of the New York Journal in
conducting the late campaign. That the
language is none too severe is well known
to the people of this City, since the Exam
iner copied many of the Journal cartoons
and added to them some equally in
famous of its own concoction.
The Stm rightly says of these cartoons
that they are "brutal, coarse and off nsive
in the extreme." They violate every sen
timent of honor and every instinct of
decency. They present to the eye all the
vulgarity which the letter press of the
Journal ana Examiner seeks to convey to
the mind.
It seems to have been the opinion of the
Â£tm that this coarseness of Mr. Hearst's
organ was the result of the Bryanite cam
paign. It says, in reference to these enr
toons: "Tnerein we see clearly the ten
dencies of the new journalism when en
listed in the cause of anarchy."
The people of San Francisco have had a
longer experience with the Examiner under
Mr. Hearst's control than the New York
people have haa with his management of
the Journal. It is well known in this City
that neither the Examiner nor the Journal
bad any occasion to borrow coarseness i
from Bryan, Altgeld or Tillman. They |
brought to the campaign more evil than j
they derived from it. For a long time
past the Examiner has been the most mon
strous illustration of decadent journalism
in America and its fakes and frauds and
sensutional indecencies have been a by
word and reproach for years.
The Sun is inclined to the belief that
decent citizens cannot guard themselves
agaii\st this latest form of sensational
depravity. This, however, is an error.
Public opinion is sufficiently powerful to
protect good citizens when it is once
roused to condemn those who assail the
honor of the individual and the dignity of
private life.
By expelling from their homes the
newspapers which contain these offenses
against manners and morals and these
insults to virtue and decency the
belter element of the commnnity
can so weaken the prestige of the sensa
tiou-mongers that there will be no profit
for the decadent journalist to engage in
them. With public indignation iairly
aroused against this latest form of in
decency there will be no need of law
courts to punish the wrongdoers. The
faker is greedy for money, and when he
sees that nothing is to De gained by
coarseness and vulgarity he may be relied
upon to cloak the foulness of his mind in
order to secure the fatness of his purse.
The Sun itself says that the individual
citizen can so far guard against this
villainy of journalism that he "can Keep
its hideous emanations out of his house,
and can likewise avoid them in his daily
movements around town, even as he
avoids other forms of filth." This advice
given to the people of New York against
the Journal may be repeated here against
the Examiner. Let good people avoid the
foul thing and it will Boon perish of its
own rottenness.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The election being over and peace and
prosperity assured the people may now
prepare to enjoy the good things in store
for them, and especially to-morrow will
they be pleased to turn their thoughts into
channels more agreeable than those of po
litical strife and resale their minds with
something more entertaining than the dry
logic --and dull figures of campaign pam
phlets. Thb Stjkday Call will meet all
requirements of that kind.
It will be found filled with good,
wholesome literature, with the best kind
of a California flavor. The tens of thou
sands of people who are heartily interested
in the development of the great university
at Berkeley will be gratified to read of
some remarkable points wherein it sur
passes all other educational institutions
of the world.
Dr. F. M. Close discourses in his learned
way on a subject of universal importance
with relation to a new scientific discovery,
"How Human Life May be Prolonged for
an Indefinite Period."
Van Dyke- Brown contributes a charm
ing letter entitled, "The Story of the Be
loved Poet of Merton Abbey," throwing
new light on the career of the late William
Morris.
A weird ghost story of San Franoisco
Bay gives diversion to the features of the
paper and furnishes much food for psychic
speculation.
Tom Gregory tells a delightful tale of
the sea, in his best style, in his amusing
account of a startling innovation on ship
board.
There are several local contributions
full of merit.
Bohemians of the City have a rare sur
prise in store for them, and they and all
their friends will therefore be eager to
peruse to-morrow's issue of The Call.
The fashion pace is up to date and the
ladies will find thereon all the very latest
decrees of fashion, while tue society gossip
will b<j as entertaining as ever.
The new 9 department of The Call can
not be too highly commended. In the
matter of local campaign intelligence its
accuracy and fairness have been unques
tioned, and for reliability and complete
ness its reputation is firmly established.
The telegraphic seryice is all that conld
bedesired; its reviews of current litera
ture are strong and admirable, and in
every way The Sunday Call suetains its
well-earned reputation as the very best
California newspaper.

ADVERTISING.
The Call publishes to-day the first of a
series of letters on advertising, which
have been specially written for this paper
by Clement Wilder, the well-known adver
tising specialist. We call particular at
tention to them as matters of importance
now that trade is reviving.
The Honorable Arthur Balfour, in a speech
before the English Newspaper Society in
London last year, said: "The general news
and comments and all the other machinery of
communicating information to the public
really are not of more importance to the com
munity at large than the power of communi
cation by advertising."
I wonder if the average business man ever
stops to think how much money is yearly in
vested in advertising. I say invested ad
visedly, tor advertising is an investment, good
or bad, according to tne attention paid to it
and the quality of the wares advertised.
It has been estimated by one of America's
best informed business experts, a man who is in
a better position to know than any other, that
there was put into advertising in the United
States alone, during the year 1895, $250,000,
-000. Of this amount $110,000,000, he says,
was paid to the newspapers. And yet in spite
of this enormous expenditure, which is in
creasing every year, the majority of business
men still look upon advertising as a bfUtnÂ«M
side issue, a sort of "charity contribution to
help support the local newspaper," and they
flee from the advertising solicitor as if he were
possessed of the plague.
Ask the ordinary business man to advertise
and six times out of eight he will reply: "Oh,
what's the use? No one will ever see my ad,
and if they do they won't read it." But pub
lish in the same medium, in the same space
and in the tame type, some indiscretion of
bis, and he will immediately become frantic
over the thought that the whole world will
know o! it.
It iÂ« not too much to say that nine-tenths of
all advertising does not pay, and when I say
this I am speaking of all kinds of advertising,
not that done in newspapers only. Six-tenth.',
because proper attention is not given 10 the
preparation of the advertisements and the
selection of mediums; three-tenths, because
| the advertisements are not backed up by right
goods and proper handling of customers.
That ndvertising does pay and pay big when
given constant, business, brainy attention is
proven by the colossal fortunes made, and
being made, in trade with advertising recog
nized as an important and essential factor.
J. C- Ayer began life as a drug clerk, and at
first advertised his Cherry Pectoral in a small
but judicious way, gradually increasing his
expenditure year by year. When he died his
fortune was estimated at $10,000,000.
Twenty years ago A. B. Scott of Scott <fe
Bowne was working at a moderate salary; to
day his firm is spending $500,000 per year in
advertising Scott's Emulsion.
Royal Baking Powder ia probably the best
knowa article manufactured in America.
J. C. Ho&eland, the originator of the ar
ticle and founder of the business, was, in the
early sixties, the proprietor of a small drug
store in Fort Wayne, Ind. Last year $700,000
was expended and 14,500 publications used iv
giving publicity to Royal Baking Powder.
Is there a business man in America who has
not beard of John Wanamaker, the merchant
prince of Philadelphia, and now of New
York also, through his purchase of the
famous house founded by A. T. Stewart ? Mr.
Wanamaker himself has said that he at
tributes his success in a very great measure
to bis continuous advertising, and that he
would as soon think of doing without clerks
as without advertising. It is worthy of note
by retailers that the advertising of the great
Wanamaker store is and always has been car
ried on almost exclusively in the daily news
papers, and that the reading matter of its ad
vertisement* in its entirety is changed each
insertion.
Those experiences ana successes are not
exceptions. The list is long and growing.
As it writer recently observed, it is becom
ing harder every day to avoid advertising. No
matter how long you have been established,
nor how old and reliable your name, if your
competitor advertises you will find yourself
compelled to meet him on his own ground and
advertise also, or he will eventually pull away
your trade. Clement Wilder.

THE WIND AND THE LEAVES
There la warfare in the garden, and the mauy are
outmatched
In the struggle of the millions and the one-
For the b Her wind is blowing, and the yellow
leaves are going,
And tne armies of the summer turn and run.
Here tney come, a flying legion, round the corner
down the path,
While they seek in vain a shelter from the foe-
By his furious onslaught scattered, clad in russet'
torn and batten*!.
Lost and ruined in tlie summer's overthrow.
Time was when they were allies In the April after
noon,
When the winter and the snows were at an end
tor he touched the earth so lightly that they issued
green itml snrightly,
And they hailej Win for their champion and
their irlend.
Then they lovfd him in the summer, and he kissed
them as he passed,
When the uniforms they wore were fresh and
green,
And ihey trusted in him blindly, for they thoueht
his voice was kindly "
As he whispered thiough the coppice or the dene.
But they found his rough advances on the gray
September morn
Very differeut from his genial breath In June:
*or when the year grew older nia friendship It
grew < older,
And he threatened and he piped a warlUe tune.
So they fought him, and he beat them; and the

Tell a sorry tale of ruin and defeat,
For the ciuel wind is roaring, and before him,
whirling, soaring
Go the lluie weary soldiers in retreat.

State.
The Board of Trade and the

Attain Success.
OAKLAND ALSO INTERESTED.
The Buildings fcr Exhibits Brought
Over From Bordeaux at a
Cost of $250,000.
California is to have an exhibition of
her natural wealth at the Guatemalan
exposition. The matter was formally set
tled yesterday, when the San Francisco
Board of Trade met with tne Chamb6r of
Commerce to consider the question.
The meeting was called to order by
Charles Bundschu, who, in a brief address,
outlined the purpose of the meeting and
spoke of the advantages that would ac
crue to the State in general and this City
in particular by taking our ligkt from
under the bushel so far as the Central
American republics are concerned.
A list of local merchants who intended
to make exhibits was then read, and the
influence of their names was such that
others immediately stepped forward and
subscribed to the undertaking. The list
in fall up to the close of the meeting is as
follows :
W. W. Montague & Co. ; A. C. Nichols & Co. ;
Johnson-Locke Mercantile Company; W. P.
Fuller & Co. ; Wash burn, Moen &'Co.; Truman
S. Clark Company; N. Clark & Son ; C. F. Kirby
Jr.; Braunscbweiger & Co.; E. R. Lilienthal;
California Cannery Company ; N. W. Spaulding
Saw Company; Gundlach, "Bundschu & Co;
Tubbs Cordage Company; Calliornia Wine
Association; California Ulue Works; Carlson-
Currier Company; Wetmore, Bowen & Co.;
California Art-glass Works: California Italian
Paste Company; Sperry Flour Company, Fred
ericksburg Brewery; S. H. Frank & Co. ;" Pacific
Coast Syrup Company.
About twenty more are expected to make
exhibits.
On motion of Mr. Lilienthal the chair
was empowered to appoint a committee to
take cnarge of the exhibits and select
a secretary. Mr. Bundschu, however,
wished a little time in which to do this.
Captain Murray stated that he had
been talking the project over with a gen
tleman from Guatemala during the lust
few days, and had learned that all the
buildings to be used at the exposition
were brought over from Bordeaux, France,
at a cost of $250,000. Ali exhibitors
had been notified that tney would be
allowed only tiil the 15th inst. in which
to secure space privileges, but the time
has now been extended for a brief period,
according to the informant. Captain
Murray further learned that the Govern
ment will forego the duty on a large num
ber of import* for a year.
The Pacific Mail Company, according to
Carl H. Clarke, will adopt tne same sched
ule of charges in freight to be used as ex
hibits as the Southern Pacific Railway,
that is, they will charge $10 a ton on stuff
going down, but will return it free of
charpe. The wharf and railroad com
pany at San Jose will also make reduc
tion?.
All those in the interior who want to
exhibit are requested to send in their ap
plications for space to the State Hoard of
Trade.
The Oakland Board of Trade has ap
pointed a committee to act in conjunc
tion with the San Francisco Board of
Trade and Chamber of Commerce in the
persons of the following: H. O. Tro
briuge, Colonel Craigie Sharpe, A. D.
Pryal, J. Terrill and C. McMullen.
The members pretent were very earnest
in their efforts to show the advantages
California might expect to secure in a
commercial way by having all enter into
the project with vim. The meeting ad
journed to the call of the chair.
FRUIT SHIPMENTS.
Over Thirty Million Founds Sent East
From San Jose in
October.
The month of October was a busy on* in
the Santa Clara Valley orchards and fruit
packing establishments, at least so say the
managers of the. Southern Pacific freight
department. General Freight Agent
Smurr announced yesterday that the total
overland shipments of fruit from San Jose
for the past month reached the extra
ordinary figure of 31,830,000 pounds. This
included prunes, dried peaches, canned
fruits, etc., and it is said to be the largest
shipment in the history of San Jose.
The general shipment of deciduous
fruits of California to the East for October
was not up to the usual standard, how
ever. The total number of loaded cars
sent out was 3963. In 1895 it was 4297- in
1894, 6357: in 1893, 5401. Under normal
conditions the figures would have been
otherwise. Owing to the disturbance and
uncertainty attending the campaign East
ern buyers let their stocks run low and
bought only for urgent demands. It is be
lieved that the present month, will more
than make up the deficiency.

AN INSANE TURFMAN
George Foster's Blind Unbalanced by
Financial Reverses in,
Gambling.
George Foster, a young man well known
to all the habitues of the race track, waÃ
yesterday committed to an insane asylum.
Foster for several years past has been
employed by John Humphreys, the local
bookmaker, and other blockmen who
have from time to time made books in the
interest of thÂ«j Gunst confederacy. He
was a particularly skillful ticket writer
and as such his services were always in
demand. During tbe poolroom days,
when Pauper alley was lined v?Hh betting
establishments, and later on, when Kings
ley's place was run in Oakland, Foster
became known to local bettors as the man
who chalked the names of the horses
upon the blackboard. He was a brigut
young fellow and made many friend*.
During the last year Foster's gambling
operations are said to have exceeded his
income and the strain of trying to pick
wimera to have been too mucti for hi 3
brain. At any rate a couple of weeks ago
he began acting queerly aad his lrienda
had him sent to the Home for the IneDri
ate, thinkinj; his condition v.as the result
of a protracted spree. After being in the
home for a week, during which time he
grew steadily worse, he was pronounced
insane by the physician in charge. Judge
Sanderson signed the order committing
him to Agnews.
THE FIRE UNDERWRITERS
Semi-Annual Meeting of Their
Pacific Coast Association
Yesterday.
No Longer a Compact to Maintain
Insurance Rates, but an Iroper
ative Body.
The general managers of the Pacific
Coast fire insurance agencies in San Fran
cisco, although retaining their associa
tion, have utterly failed in uniting on a
standard for business guidance, such as
would maintain rates among their various
offices. They met yesterday at Battery
and California streets, they chatted over
business matters in a general way and
discussed the results of the election, but
such a thine as a compact on insurance
rates was not mentioned.
This meeting was the semi-annual ses
sion of the Board of Fire Underwriters of
the Pacific. It was well attended, as
nearly all the principal insurance offices
in San Francisco were represented.
Charles D. Haven, the president, occupied
the chair.
George Tyson of the German-American
Company, George W. Spencer of the
Eina, Henry K. Beldeu of the Hartford
and C. F. Mullina of -the Commercial
Union were appointed members of the
executive committee. Four members of
this committee retire at the semi-annual
meetings and three at the yearly ses
sions.
The underwriters accepted the report
of their treasurer, George E. Butler,
about expenditures and receipts of the
last naif-year, which were satisfactory to
the board.
"The Board of Underwriters," said one
of its members after the meeting, "is sim
ply an inoperative association â just lives
along and holds us together without doing
anything for our mutual good. It could
not do anything, anyhow, it seema, be
cause rates couid never be held up while
some fellows v.ould surely fight. It has
no effect whatever on rates er rules gov
erning the conduct of offices. For that
reason we took no action with regard to
insurance rates. The board is not a com
pact nowadays."
Zieland Stanford Camp.
Leland Stanford Camp held a called meeting
last night at Kohler & Chase Hall. It was de
cided to make a permanent political and social
organization, and committees were appointed
on by-laws. Thanks were extended to all the
firms or iriends that had extended kindness to
tne camp during the campaign lust closed.
The daughter of the camp, Miss Dora Johns
ton, gave a recitation. Special thanks were
extended to. the papers of this City for favor
able notices of meetings. At 10 P. K. the meet-
Ing adjourned to Wednesday, November 18, at

The British Ship Alcides as She Appeared in the Typhoon of October 15 Last. Her Sails "Were Blown Away and She Was on Her Eeam Ends for Eight Hours.
The Atove Sketch Is From a Description Furnished by the Officers and Crew.
ALCIDES CAUGHT
IN A TYPHOON
The Good Ship Was on Her
Beam Ends for Eight
Hours. -
Sails Were Blown From the Bolt
Ropes and the Ballast
Shifted.
ACCIDENT TO THE UNADILLA.
One of the Manhole Gaskets Blew
Out anl She Had to Lay Up
for Repairs.
The British ship Alcides, which arrived
here yesterday after a smart run of thirty
days from Yokohama, had an exciting
experience last month. When the master
saw that a storm was brewing he at once
began to shorten sail, but before all the
canvas was in a typhoon struck the ship
and she was thrown on her beam ends.
The few sails that were on the yards were
blown out of the bolt ropes and for eight
hours it was nip and tuck whether the
stout vessel would right or go down. To
make matters worse the ballast shifted,
but when hope seemed gone tha Alcides
passed out of the revolving storm and the
danger was over.
"We had fair weather after leaving
Yokohama up to October 15 last," said
Captain Dart yesterday. "Then we were
in latitude 43 nortb, longitude 165 east.
A heavy typhoon from the south-south
west and west came up, and we were at
its mercy for seveml hours. Many of our
sails were blown away, the snip was
thrown on her beam ends and our ballast
shifted. Tnat was our worst experience
and we had no more trouble in reaching
Ban Francisco."
Judging from the looks of the Alcides
she must also have lost some of her boats,
and the chances are that some repairs
will have to be made before she will begin
loading wheat for Europe. This is the
third trip Captain Dart has made to this
port, but it is the first time he has ever
reported a typhoon. The accompanying
sketch was drawn from a description of
the scene when the Alcides was in the
typhoon, furnished by the officers and
crew of the vessel.
The rear-admiral, the officers and their
wives and the enlisted men from IVlare
Island did not make the return trip on
the Government tvÂ«Â» Unadilla yesterday.
Instead they went back on the steamer
Monticello and paid their way. When
only half-way to San Francisco the man
hole gasket blew out and the water from
the boiler leaked into the bilges.
Steam was kept up, however, and the
tug reached Pacific-street wharf in safety.
The water was then pumped out of the
hold and tha work of repairing the tug
began. The boilers bad to be blown down
and coolea off before the manhole could be
fixed, and that made it necessary to hold
the vessel here until tnis morning. The
damage is trifling, but siill it caused in
convenience.
Six carrier pigeons from the Mare Island
cotes were brought down on the Unadilia.
At 1:10 o'clock they were released, and
each one carried a message stating that
the tug would not return last night owing
to the accident, but would return early to
day.
The whaling steamer Belvedere got in
from the Arctic yesterday wjth 21,000
pounds of bone, 450 barrels o! whale oil,
145 pounds of ivory, foxskins and 4
bearskins. The body of Boatheader
Thomas P. Warren, who was killed by
a whale on October 13 last, was also
brought down. The story of Warren's
tragic death was brought down by the
steam-whaler Balaena. The remains were
banded over to deceased's relatives, ana
will be buried here.

caused some damage. The little tug Annie
went to the assistance of the big tramp

The news of Captain Pearne's illness
had been telegraphed to his wife and she
is now on her way to Hontckong. She

there.
Captain Blair, the popular master of the
big ship California, is now chief officer of
the steamer Tauric, plying between Liver

to tiie White Star line, Dut when the com
pany failed to get a purchaser for the
California she was laid up and Blair was
transferred to the Tauric. Now that busi

There will be a grand ratification by
Republicans of this City to-night of the
election of McKinley and Hobart. -Though
there has been no time for preparation,
the demonstration is wholly a spontaneous
outburst of enthusiasm over the victory
for protection. v:
It was only yesterday that definite ar
rangements were made for the ratification,
and presently the public gaze was con
fronted with conspicuous placards bearing
this notice:

*: Attend Republican Ratification *
: Meeting, Saturday Night at . ;
: the Auditorium. ;
Wherever this call to loyal Republicans
was displayed there were frequent and
numerous inquiries as to where instruc
tions could be got with regard to the pa
rade and the subsequent meeting. Repub
licans who marched in the monster parade
last Saturday afternoon were eager to
know how they could anange to march
again. One and all evinced a strong de
sire to show their unbounded joy over the
election by once more demonstrating to
the people that they were as enthusiastic
after the victory as before for protection
and prosperity.
The ratification will consist of a street
parade and a mass-meeting with all the Re
publican orators who worked in the cam
paign on the platform.
The spirit of tne occasion has been
caught by H. R. Hurbut, the poet of Tu
olurnne County, whose patriotic verses on
many great events have stirred the hearts
of the people. For this event be has been
inspired to pen a glowing poem, from
which the following verses are selected:
FALL IN LINE.
You are wanted in procession,
When the band begius to play,
To ratify the victory
We won election day;
And there's no use going 'bout tt
If we don't do tuiugs up fine;
YOU are wanted in procession;
Fall in line.
You are wanted in procession,
At the beating of the arum,
To do honor to the party
That will make our factories hum;
And we'il be remiss In duty
If we don't do things up fine;
YOU are wanud in procession;
Fall in line.
A meeting of the Republican clubs of
the City wa3 hejd last night at the Re
publican County Committee rooms, 950
Market street, for the purpose of making
arrangements for the parade. Charles
Curry was elected grand marshal of the
procession.
The positions of uniform club 9 prior to
starting were placed at Union Square, in
the vicinity of Post and Powell streets.
When these clubs fail into line and march
citizens with flags will drop in and follow
to the Auditorium building on Eddy and
Jones streets.
The line of march will be alone Post
street to Kearny, thence on Kearny to
Pine street, down Pine to Montgomery
and on to Market street, along which the
procession will move as far out as Larkin
street. At Larkiu the parade will coun
termarch to Mason street and then pa3s
on to Eddy to the Auditorium.
The mass-meeting will be held under the
joint auspices of the Republican State
Central Committee and the McKinley In
vincibles. It has been decided to have the
Republican orators deliver speeches, each
of which will be limited to live minutes.
In this way all the prominent men who
led the Republican party to victory in this
City will appear before the public."
The following aids to the grand marshal
were appointed: A. de la Torn* Jr., chief
of staff; aidsâ Colonel T. V. Eddy, Phenix

POINTED LETTER.
A Peep Into Some Business Corre-
spondence.
In reply to a letter from a minister in
New Jersey who had inquired regarding
some nourishing and bealtbfnl drink that
would take tbe place of coSee for those
wbo bad been injured by coffee drinking,
tbe following statements were made:
"Our I'ostum coffee is a food drink which
looks Jike the finest Iriocba coffee and hns
tbe fragrant aroma. It creams up with
the golden brown color of old Java, and
really seems to the coffee drinker a verit-
able cup of the much loved beverage, but
it is made wholly and entirely of grains,
and is decidedly fattening and nourish-
ing. The stomach troubles and bowel and
liver complaints disappear under its
use. for tire reason that the real coffee,
which contains the same poisonous alka-
loids as strychnine, tobacco, whisky and
morphine, has been dismissed, and pure
food in a liquid form taken in its place.
Postum is shipped to physicians, and by
order of physicians to various parts of the
country. A packafte containing enough
for lifty cup;, is sent for 25 cents, post-
paid ; twelve packages by express prepaid,
$2 50.
It is used by the children and their
parents ireely with good results. It is
highly recommended by the medical pro-
fession and others, but we take the posi-
tion that a preparation that is made of
nature's pure grains alone needs no
human indorsement. It has its health
certificate from a higher sovirce. Very
respectfully, Postum Cereal Co. (Lim.),

and rehashed some of the stock theories
about the causes of McKiniey's victory.
"The press here don't like me very well,
I euÂ«Â»s9," said the Senator at the Palace
last night; "it seems that it doesu't, any
way, from what I have heard. But it is
the most patriotic press I ever saw.
"About the campaign? Boodle and
coercion won. That's all there was of it.
The country has gone to the devil. The

SPORTSMAN'S REALM
What Is Being Done on Field and Stream by
Trap and Range*
The lovers of good boxing can safely
count upon two great events within the
next five weeks. The Carroll and Me-
Auliffe ten-round contest, which will be
held on the evening of the 18th inst.,
should prove a most scientific battle, as
tbe men are, so to speak, skilled
mechanics.
On December 2, unless something un
foreseen should happen, the great heavy
weight battle between Fitzsimmons and
Sharkoy will occur. It is hardly neces
sary to remark that this contest will draw
an immense crowd to the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
The annual fly-casting tournament of
the Fly-casting Club will be held to-day on
Stowe Lake.
A football game will be held this after
noon at Central Park between teams com
posed of freshmen from the Stanford and
.Berkeley universities.
The oarsmen are in active training for
tbe races which will be held on Thanks
giving day.
THE WHEELMEN.
San Rafael Races Postponedâ New
Velodrome Track.
The road races which were to have been
held to-morrow in the vicinity of San
Rafael have been postponed one week for
the reason that many of the riders have
not had time to train properly, owing to
the excitement incident to the election.
Entries may be sent in up to next Wednes
day night to Frank M. Byrne, 516 Jones
street. Already about thirty have been
received for the handicap event. The
prizes are valuable and the races will be
worth seeing.
This leaves to-morrow practically blank
as far as road races or club runs are con
cerned, and most of the riders will proba
bly go to the park. Some of the clubs
H. A. Goddard, B. C W v Holder
of the Coast Two-Mile Record
( Unpaced).
have called runs for San Rafael, but these
have now been declare.! off for one week.
The split in the Imperial Cycling Club,
as exclusively announced in The Call
Thursday, is liable to result unfortunately
for that big organization if the breach is
not soon healed. It seems that the majority
of the members favored George P.Weimore
for Superintendent of Streets, but a few
were working hard for Ambrose. AÂ« tbe
club is a member of the Wheelmen's Mu
nicipal League, which had indorsed Wet
more, most of the members were in favor
of staving by their Hug, and naturally re
sented the efforts of a few to create a "feel
ing against Wetmore in the clud and thus
aid in his defeat. The presid&nt and vice
president have resigned and a good ruanv
ol the members are thinking of do*ng the
same.
H. A. Gnddard of the Bay City Wheel
men will leave here to-morrow inght and
go direct to London, where he wi : l take
charge of the Cleveland people's interests,
(ioddard is well known and quite popular
among the wheelmen here, and has gained
considerable prominence both as a racing
man and as a scribe. He holds the record
for thu fastest unpaced five miles ever rid
den on the coait, 12:13, made on the Hay
wards road not long since. His departure
for a foreign clime will be noted with more
or less regret by hiÂ« many friends in the
wheeling frniernit3' here."
The members ol the Acme, Reliance
and Alameda clubs across the bay will
participate in a b ind joint club run to
morrow. The start will be promptly at 10
a. m. from tha Acme Club, destination un
known, but the rider who can guess the
spot selected for luncheon wiil be pre
sented with a valuable prize. Prepara
tions have been made >o accommodate
over 200 wheelmen, and as this will in all
probability be the last run ol the year, the
cifferent captains will endeavor to have
as many men in line as possible. Mem
bers of these clubs are at liberty to invite
friends on this run.
The Alpha (ladies") Cycling Club will
hav^ a run to the park to-morrow morn

Otto Ziegler Jr. is expected in the City
to- morrow, for the first time since his re
turn from the Eastern circuit.
Tbe Yosemiie Cycle .v have moved to
their new headquarters, Armory Hall, on

The following are the officers for the ensu
ing year: W. A. Searles. president; Phil
N. Hammersmith, secretary- treasurer ; N.
Lowenleld, financial secretary ; E. Boukof
sky, captain; M. P. Hayes, first lieuten
ant; L. Craw, second lieutenant; rVed
Grant, color-bearer. Una-iached riders
ore invited to join the club, which is now
in a ttourisbinc condition.
If you cannot withstand the chilling
winds and the cold weather of winter and
are determined to abandon the wheel un
til next spring give it some attention and
do not toss it in a corner. Go over every
part of tbe frame with vaseline and then
wrap the mucbine in rags or in one of the
paper envelopes for the purpose, which
can be purchased in any city. "Then hang
the wheel up in some dry, out-of-the-way
place, and when you take il out next
spring it will be in as good condition as it
is to-day. With the temperate climate of
this State, however, it is hardly worth
while to put one's wheel away at all, as
some most enjoyable riding can be had in
the dead of winter when the weather is
clear.
The members of the California Cycling
Club have elected ihe following officers to
serve for the ensuing year: Robert Dun
can, president: John F. Burke, vice-presi
dent; William Reid, secretary; W. O.
Johnson, financial secretary; W. Sang
ster, treasurer; W. Smed^ke, sergeant-at
arms; F. C. Hansen, captain; E. M.
Boyle, first lieutenant; X Muller, second
lieutenant. The only contest was for the
captaincy, F. N. Bent rnnning against Mr.
Hansen. To-morrow the^club was going
to San Rafael to witness the road races
there, in which several of tho members
are entered, but the run has been post-
poned a week. A. Thiesen and C. J-
Birdsall of the Californias make one of
ihe speediest amateur tandem teams on
the coast, and are in constant training at
the new Velodrome track.
Don't let the air out of a tire when not
in use to "save it." Tires are much better
off when standing if well inflated. Gen
erally speaking a small tire requires more
pressure than a large one, if it is to carry
the same weigh:, and a given tire requires
more pressure in proportion as the rider
is heavy. A tire should always contain
enough air to keep its rim from the
ground. If in ruling you feel the slightest
jar as your wheel runs over ordinary ob
stacles it is because there is not sufficient
air pressure. There 13 no danger of burst
ing a tire, as many riders seem to fear,
when the small hund pump i;Â» used, and
even with the best foot pump only the
very weakest tires could be Durst. An ex
tensive observation has found a great
many tires which were very much too son,
while one is rarely lound too hard.
The chainlets bicycle idea is causing
much comment among the makers and
riders. It is said on good authority that
at least four of the large makers will put
such wheels on the market next season.
Now that the election is over the. Bay
City Wheelmen are beginning to make
preparations for their annual entertain
ment and dance in December. A ball
pool tournmtnt is also on the tapi< ana
the house committee has some other sur
prises in store for the members.
The new Velodrome track will be lively
to-day with the different amateur and pro
fessional riders in training.
The proposed opening meet on Satur
day afternoon, No/ember 21, will have an
attractive card, the star event beinj; the
match races between Wells and Foster, as
to the outcome of which opinion is about
divided. The track is admitted to be the
finest in the State and fully equal to the
very best in the East. R. P. Aylward,
who has just returned from the National
circuit and who has visited tnem all, said
he couldn't recall a single Eastern track
of similar size which was any better and
many are not so good, and the seating and
general acrominodat|pns here are much
superior. It is by long odds the best track
ever constructed in this City. Ayiward
thinks the unpaced mile record should be
easy on it, and that a fou;- eated pacing
machine mounted by good men and fol
lowed by a crack rider could bring the
world's mile record here after a few trials.

FOOTBALL.
Stanford and Berkeley Freshmen
Meet To-Day.
The third annual intercollegiate football
match between the Berkeley and Stanford
freshmen teams will be played on the
Central Park gridiron this afternoon.
Game will be called at 3 o'clock.
The stripped weights of the men and
the positions they will play in are indi

tation, but whom the critics say has not
yet shown tmch abi.ity as to assume a
prominent position among the more expe
rienced members of the college squad.
Anderson of Petaluma, Right Half
Berkeley Freshman Team.
That, however, does not necessarily mean
that be may not be a likely player in his
class. Burnett is a big, strong fellow,
who has gained valuablo experience on
the second elevon trying to cope with
Williams, the big, aggressive Varsity
center.
McGilvray^played end on the Varsity in
the first Stanford-Olympic match and wns
injured during the game. Murphy, who
captains thf team from the quarterback
position and will p'obably be acting cap
tain ana quarterback for the Varsity In
ihe Thanksgiving intercollegiate match,
is the most likely tootb.iil-piayer that has
entered Stanford this year.
Cool, a good general, a good runner, es
pecially in a scattered field, and a sure
punter, Murphy is one of t ose few fresh
men that come with athletic reputations
that do not vanish with the dawn of actual
college life. He has played in two of this
season's Varsity matches and has acquit
ted himself creditably. Lanagan was cap
tain last year of the Denver (Colo.) High
School team and is said 10 be a feir pun
ter, though his lack of weight handiraps
him considerably as a competitor for Var
sity honors.
With both Murphy and Lanagan back
of the line kicking is sure to be a strong
feature of the game of the Stanford fresh
men, while the superior weight of the
Berkeley fre&hrnen line would indicate,
perhaps, that line bucking will tieure con
sdicuouslv in the plays tried by the blue
and -old Crst-yearsmen. Apparently the
Berkeley and Stanford freshmen teams
with respect to their line strength and
punting ability, reverie the order of things
exi-ting in the two Var-ity elevens.
Of the Berkeley freshmen team Barnes
is the new-found big man from Santa
Cruz, who has recently emerged from the
obscurity ol the freshmen ranks and be
come a Varsity possibility, where heavy
men are wanted badly. Birdsall is tbe
large, rotund center, who enjoyed an
ante-college reputation at Sacramento
belore he entered Berkeley, and readily

acquired a position in tbe middle of toe
Varsity line, where he has played in
every match this season. Mclsaacs is
tackle for the Olympics or at Berkeley,
as necessity arises, registration in one of
the aflihated colleges in this City making
him eligible to double duty.
Anderson entered Berkeley from the
Oakland High School, and was one of the
very few experienced football players
among a very loose class of century men.
While not a Varsity man, because of the
sure veteran material already behind the
line on tt}e big team, Anderson is counted
a very good freshman. Whipple, the full
back,' played half on the Varsity for a
while last Tuesday against Reliance, but
Birdsall of Sacramento, Center
Berkeley Freshman Team,
did nothing particular to mark him a* a
valuable man or as a football failure. The
fact that he is on the Varsity would indi
cate that he is considered one of the more
promising of the new men.
To Whipple. then, and Birdsall and
Mclsaacs and Anderson and Barnes spec
tators will look for particular manifesta
tions of individual ability among the
Berkeley eleven; while Murphy anil Lana
gan and McGilvray should attract cor
responding notice for individual work for
the cardinal. The other men are to fame
and glory yet unknown, except, perhaps,
among their relatives and near friends,
but to-night may see several of them
heroes beyond the roseate dreams of the
most ambitious freshmen of the lot.
From these men will be formed the big
Varsity teams of a few years hence. Look
ing upon the match from such a stand
point, future possibilities may be reckoned
when Captain Kansome and Suerman
have left Berkeley and when Captain Fick
ert and Williams have become traditions
at Stanford.
Both freshmen elevens have been beaten
by the Belmont School team. A compari
son of the gann s and of the freshmen
playing in each gave rise to the belief that
the Palo Alto freshmec had a slight ad
vantage. This, howe.er, is not now ap
parent since the increase of weight in the
Berkeley team and the disbarment of sev
eral of the Staniord players on account of
certain registration qualifications required
by th<Â» intercollegiate agreement.
Then, too, Berkeley goes into the game
with two victories by preceding freshmen
classes, while the Stanford treÂ«hmen must
exert extra efforts to overcome the en
couraging feeling of prestige in their
opponents, a leeling that year after year
has been sunh a power with the almost in
vincible Yale Varsity.
Captain Murphy of the Stanford fresh
men football team has hopes of winning
to-day's game, Dut he is not over-san
guine, and intimates that he expects a
hard game, as he understands that the
Berkeley freshmen havo been under But
terworth's special coaching ior some time,
while his own team has played but half a
dozen practice games as a team.
"If the men go into the game with the
right spirit ant) determined to win they
ought to do It." said he, "but if they fail
to play for all they are worth or allow
themselves to get discouraged or play in
differently they are going to suffer defeat.
I don't expect them to do any such
thing. I believe every man is going to do
hiÂ« best, and I am, therefore, hopeful."
Unfortunately for the team several of
the men expected to piay have been pro
tested by Berkeley, because they are reg
istered as special students and" Stanford
has consented to get along wit out them.
Some others have been injured recently
and will either be unable to enter the
match at all or will go into the game in
bad condition.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 6.â Next in im
portance to the great intercollegiate
Thanksgiving footbail game between
Berkeley and Stanford will be the gridiron
contest which will take place between the
fresiimen of those two universities to
morrow at Central Park.
With two signal victories over the Stan
ford Ireshmen, the gume last year having
been won by a score of 44 toO, the Berke
ley men expect to maintain the precedent
established by the classes of '98 and '99
and come out triumphant in to-morrow's
battle. At the opening of the season tbe
outlook among the freshmen was not in
the least encouraging, ami many were in
clined to believe that Stanford would win
this year, hut within the Jast fortnight
things have changed. Several experienced
menj who had not been out previously,
Barnes of Santa Cnsi, Right Tackte
Berkeley Freshman Team.
came down to the field and added much
strength to the material already on hand.
The team taken as a whole is considerably
heavier than the freshmen eleven last
year, and if anything they are more expe
rienced.
As individual players, nearly all of them
have been doing fair work, but the disad
vantage of not having been able to practice
together has worked them considerable
harm. Though both Butterworth and
Nott have been working hard on them all
week, they do not play with the unity
and precision that they should for first
class footbail. At all events, they expect
to win the Dalm from Stanford again, but
not without much effort.
From the following sketch of the per
sonnel of the team, something of an idea
as to their qualifications may be gained:
Birdsall, the 204-pound center, hails
from Sacramento, where he had consider
able experience on his High School
eleven. He has been practicing steadily
ever since tne opening of the football sea
son at Berkeley. For the first two or
three weeks he was on the second eleven,
but as soon as Selfridge, the last year's
Varsity center, found that be could not
piay any longer this season, BirdsaM took
his place and has been playing on the first
eleven ever since. In each of the games
played this season, with the exception of
the one with Belmont, Birdsall has been
center and has gained considerable ex
perience, though he is still weak on the
defensive. He has both weight and
strength, being the heaviest man on the
field with the single exception of Molera.
It is expected, however, that hi Bur
nett, who will play opposite him on the
Palo Alto eleven, he will find a dangerous
rival, but from a study of the two men
the odds are in favor of Birdsall. McDer
mott, the right guard, is a student in the
law college. He has been playing center
against Birdsall considerable of the time
lately, and is in lairly good form, weigh
ing, stripped, 190 pounds. He has im
proved considerably in. defensive work
lately, and on the offensive breaks
through the line admirably. He is slow
in getting down the field after breaking
through the line, but seldom fails to bring
down his man when in search of him.
With Peck as left guard McDermott will
have a strong supporter. While weighing
eigbt pounds less than McDermott what
Peck lacks in weight he makes up in
daso and staying qualities. Peck comes
from S>quel, Santa Cruz County, and is a
fine specimen of physical manhood, stand
ing 5 feet 9 inches in bis stockings and
weighing 182 pounds stripped. He has
not been out for practice very long, but
what time he has been on the field has
been well spent.
In Barnes, from the Santa Cruz High
School, the team will have a powerful
Smythe, Left Half Berkeley Fresh
man Team.
right tackle who tips the beam at 185
pounds. Though he has not beefc out for
more than a fortnight, he aas been
rapidly getting into Varsity form, and
will put up v. hard game to-morrow if his
wind does not fail him. He is easily
I reckoned as one of the most promising
players in the eleven.
Mclsaacs, who will play the other tackle,
is quite well known in amateur football
circles, Laving done good service as tackl â¢
on the Olympic team (hiring the early
part of the season. He is lighter by fifteen
pounds than Barnes, but is in belter form
than the latter, having gone into training
early in the season. Heis full oi dash and
spirit, breaks through well, and when on
the defensive stops the plays of his op
ponents better man most of the candidates
for his position.
Alien, who will play right end, comes
from Santa Ana, while Masters, who plays
left, is a Berkeley boy. Allen is rather
light for his place, weighing only 146, but
he has an endless amount of snap and
| vigor, which he puts to good use in stop
ping plays around bis end. He is a fairly
good sprin:er, tackles hard and nearly
always holds his man when once be grasps
him.
Masters, the left end, weighs 148 pounds
and is well proportioned. He seems to
succeed better on the offensive than on
the defensive, and when once past his op
ponent he is fast down the field. Though
occasionally erratic he puts up a strong
game for a man of his weight and experi
ence.
Austin, from Santa Cruz, will piay at
quarter. To-day he weighed, stripped,
just 135 pounds. He is slow in passing
and fumbles too frequently for the best
good of his team. He holds his head well,
uses much judgment in giving hia signals
for plays and is quick to capture the ball
on a fumble.
Whipple, who has been playing both at
full and at half back, will nil the former
position to-morrow. He will take the ball
at half, occasionally, however, and when
necessary will drop back for kicks. He
has been doing h's best work at half.
He is quick at starting with the ball, but
is thrown too easily when running. He
has not yet learned to use his arm to
ward off interference to best advantage,
but with a clear field he sets up a hot
sprint and is considered a good ground
gainer.
Bmythe, whose home is in Berkeley,
gives promise of making a crack half
back. He plays a bard, fast game, and
hits the line like a pile-driver. He weighs
only 146 pounds, and like Eddie Sherman,
who is just the same weight, is quick to
see holes in the line and get through
them. He has the faculty of being every
where all at once, and when ha has got
there knows what to do.
Anderson, who comes from Petahima,
will play right half. He weighs 162
pounds, and i 3 very muscular. At half he
plays a fairly accurate game, is quick to
get down the field with the ball, and is
good at catching the punt of tbe oppo
nents. He hits the line hard, and, once
tackled, he struggles hard to get the bull
as far forward as possible beforo the
whistle of tbe umpire signals down. He
is in every scrimmage, and when it comes
to a struggle it generally takes two men to
hold him. â¢
With such a team California expects to
go into the game as present victor over
the Palo Alto men and come out of it with
Colors still flying.
Shooting at Shell Mound.
There will be considerable rifle and pis
tol shooting at the Shell Mound ride
range to-morrow. The following events
will take place:
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club, medal
and prize shooting; San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein. medai and turkey shoot
ing; Germania Schuetzen Club, medal
shooting; Norddeutscher Schuetzen Clnb,
bullseye shooting. Independent Rifles,
monthly medal contests.
The following companies of the Na
tional Guard will also hold their monthly
medal and class shooting contests : C and
G (Nationals) and companies F, X and M.
THE GUN.
Prominent Shooting Club to Have
a Home and a Preserve.
The Olympic Gun Club has leased a
building containing twelve room at 1309
Van Ness avenue, between Sutter and
Bush streets, which will be completely
furnished and ready for occupancy
Wednesday. The club will hold semi
monthly trap-shooting contests through
out the season, both at live birds and
blue rocks. In the near future the club
will lease several acres of land in Marin
County, where quail and deer are said to
be plentiful. The officers are also figur
ing upon leasing several acres of marsh
lands in the vicinity of Black Point for
duck-shooting purposes. The members
of the club are: W. 0. Brown. H. J.

The annual meeting of the club will be
held at the clubhouse on Wednesday even
ing next. C. A. Haight, J. S. Fanning,
W. J. Golcher, M. O. Feudner and Frank
Vernon were elected a committee on
permanent organization, to report at the
meeting. There will be not less than 100
members, all active sportsmen, on the roil
befor. 1 December 1, making the club one
of the largest purely shooting organiza
tions in the United States.
The casa of Tentberry vs. Jones, which
was to have been tried yesterday before
the Superior Court of Solano County at
Fairfield, was postponed because of the
absence of some of the witnesses.
Although wild ducks of many varieties
are plentiful in the marshes, the shooting
has been very poor. The weather is alto
gether too fine and the birds depart for
the bay just as soon as the first light of
day appears in the east. Hunters must
wait for stormy weather.
The quail-shooters are having fairly
good sport, but in most places the birds
hide in the trees and are hard to bag.
The lovera of snipe-shooting are looking
for tbe coming of Jacu Frost, whose arri
val is the signal that good snipe-shooting
is to be had.
THE ANGLERS.
A Large Gathering Will Witness the
Great Tournament To-Day
at Stow Lake.
The annual fly-casting tournament of
the Fly-casting Club will be held to-day,
commencing at 10 a. m., on Stow Lake,
Golden Gate Park.
As the weatner is just right for a contest
with the rods, it can be safely said that a
large and enthusiastic gathering of ladies
and gentlemen wiil be present to witness
the tournament.
Fly-casting is a most enjoyable and
artistic pa -time, which clings to any per
son who has once mastered the science.
To cast a fly with accuracy and delicacy
at any particular object may appear to the
uninitiated a rather easy thing to ac
complish, bat it is not, a fact wnich can be
substantiated by all of those good and
honorable fellows â which anglers must be
to be anglers in the full sense of the word â
who have mastered the gentle art of fly
casting from years of experience on stream
and lake.
It wiil be remembered that in every art
there has been one great master. Paint
ing had it? Raphael, sculpture had its
Michael Angelo, poetry its Homer, and
fly-casting its Golcier; but since the days
of Andrew and Peter there have been
many anglers, but there has been only
one Emmet Tuttle. He was the angler
sans pareil, the king of all the fishermen
so to speak. He so lar excelled all others
of his day that comparison belittles him.
It is said that he could have fished a
stream following in the footsteps of old
Izaak Walton, and discount the great
master.
But there are superior men now living
who are competent to teach the old
masters a lesson at least in fly-casting,
either for distance or for accuracy, and
Tuttle or Walton, if they could but wit
ness the contests of to-day, would not
hesitate to say that â there- are others.
According to the rules which will govern
tbe tournament all rods used by competi
tors must be single-banded and all casting
must be done with one hand. Rods must
not exceed 11 feet in length. In event
1 the weight of the rod is not limited, in
event 2 the weight of rod shall not exceed
8^ ounces, and in event 3 the weight
shall not exceed 5)4 ounces.
Competitors may consult their own inclina
tions in choice of reel and line, but lines must
nor be knotted or weighted.
The leader shall be of single gut and shall
not be less than six nor more than nine feet
in lengih.
Flies used by competitors shall be approved
by the captain. One fly only shall be used,
which shall not be larger than No. 5 and on
whicn the snell shall not exceed six inches in
length. Hooks shall not be broken at the
bend.
All catting shall be done from a platform
at least eight feet square and the surface of
which shall be not more than eighteen laches
above the water line.
For each event there shall be a champion
ship medal of gold, which shall be awarded to
the contestants winning the greatest number
of contests during tbe series in such event.
There may also in the discretion of the
executive committee be awarded merchandise
prizes to contestants standing second and
third in such event*.
Should two or more contestants win an
equal number of contests in any event during
the aeries they shall cast off the tie at the last
meeting of the series, or at such other time as
may be designated by the captain. Ties for
merchandise or other prizes snail be deter
mined in the name manner.
While contests are in progress members
shall not make remarks to judges, referee or
contestants, or in any way detract their atten
tion. It shall be the duty of the captain to
see that this rule is strictly enforced.
Contestants not using their own rods shall
usa the rods furnished by the club.
Horace Smith will judge the contest
for delicacy and accuracy. John P. Bab
cock will act as referee and Willis A.
Bachelor has been selected captain of the
tournament.
J. R. Chase writes from Santa Cruz that
the bay is literally alive with sardines and
that salmon-fishing is now in order. Mr.
Chase caught a salmon of twenty-four
pounds weight on Sunday last and sev
eral smaller tish have been caught during
the week.
HANDBALL.
Something Concerning- Jones, the
Australianâ To-Morrow's Games.
The following handball games will be
played to-morrow in the Union handball
court:
W. Prince and C. Carson will play J. Hogan
and M. Bascn.
J. O'Donnell and J. Collins will play J.
White and R. Murphy.
W. Casserly and Jap Lyons will play F.
Kieruan and J. Quinlun.
The event of the day will be between R.
Lenihan ana J. Nelson and J. Harlow and
Terry McManus.
The friends in this City of John Jones
the Australian champion handball player,'
were much disappointed at receiving
news by the last mail from Sydney that
Jones' match with Oughton, another ceie
brated player, bad been declared oft The
me ?' xT lth their Ackers, met at
Wallsend, New South Wales, where the
first series of games wi!h the rubber ball
was to be played. To the surprise of
Jones and his backers Ou.'hton held tuat,
according to the articles of a-reement,
tennis balls should be used in both series.
Jones contended that the understanding
distinctly was that the hard ball should
be used in the second series of games to
f, pl */*& in vu S y dne y. and his backers
alleged that the clause stipulating that
the soft ball should be used in both -cries
was never read to them. Finally Oughton
agreed to play on the conditions stipu
lated by Jones, and just as the men were
starting in to play one of Oughtoii's back
ers positively declined to allow him to
play if the hard ball was to be used in
Sydney, and tne referee declared the
match off, each side to take bark the
amount deposited. The outcome was a
great disappointment, to all lovers of
handball in the colony.
Jones wrote to a friend that he was in
fine condition for tho match DeinÂ«- re
duced from 164 to 143 pounds.' He could
not say what kind of a player Ouphton
is, as he had never seen him play, but
judged him to be first class, as the betting
was 3 to 1 that Jones would not score 10
aces out of the 51 with the soft bali. Jones
intended returning here if he won the
match, but will have to wait till the tide
of success turns his way.
At the San Francisco handball qourt a
good programme has been arranged for to
morrow, as follows:
C. Su'.livan and J. McEvely vs. J. Slattery

GOLD PROPERTIES
British Mining Men Believe
We Will Soon Have
a Boom.
AH the Properties on the Mother
Lode Are Now
Bonded.
LOOKING FOR HAMILTON SMITH
J B. Irving of Englani on the Mining
â¢ Situationâ California Develop
ment Company.
J. B. Irving, a mining engineer of Lon
don, who for some months has been ex
amining into the gold mines in outlying
districts of California with the view of
making investments, is at the Grand. Mr.
Irving has spent a great deal of time on
the mother lode, especially in Mariposa,
.Calaveras and Tuolurahe counties.
He says that British mining men are
looking with interest to the gold mines of
[ California. They believe we are on the
edge of a great mining boom, and if there
N v as at the present time one or two great
strikes, the interest wou.d become extra
ordinary.
The settlement of the financial question
in the United States, he recounts also, will
greatly help this country, especially as to
the price of railway tocks and other se
curities. In mining, too, ii will be rather
an aid than otherwise.
"I have been over the mother lode a
good deal since my arrival," said Mr.
Irving, "and have pretty generally in
formed myself as to the properties there.
There has been a eood deal of interest in
mining claims for some time there, and it
has tak?n a practical form in that nearly
everything on the lode has been bomied.
"Tnose who got the bonds anticipated
that there would be lively times and cot
â¢in ahead and secured the property. You
can hardly drive along anywhere now on
tn"e lode that you won't find the property
taken in this way.
"You won't rind much of it sold. There
is littl- of that, but tnere has be .n an en
ormous amount of bonding. I should say
things were in good shape for a boom in
California gold ruining.
"If tne London Exploration Company
closes in full the contract for the great
Mariposa grant, as is expected when
Hamilton Smith arrives here, it will do
more than any other one thine. I think,
to enlist the interest of British mining
men in California. On the Mariposa
grant there are probably a dozen mines,
and each one of these will be capitalized
.separately and the stock sold in London.
These mines will all be worked, and one
â  wUy anu another great good ought to re-
Buit to California Irom them.
"It is the poiicy of the Exploration
Company to organize smaller companies
in this way. The California Development
Company, which was lately organized and
wh-cb is understood to belong to the Ex
ploration Company, has a great deal of
] roperty in Tuolumne County. Driving
aiong, there you see their white stakes in
many places.
â¢I" am of the impression that gold
mining h*re will during tne next year or
two be quite active. By the end of tftat
time there may be such discoveries as will
cause a rush to the gold regions here
wh eh will be something like the rush to
South Africa and Australia. It is certain
that a great deal of bonding has been
done on the strength of a belief in a boom
in mining. "
Mr. Irving is somewhat reticent as to
just what he is doing in mining. He has
. lately been in the vicinity of San Andreas.
It is expected that when Hamilton
Smith gets here, as be will do now in a
few days, all the mines on the whoie 43,000
acres of the Mariposa grant will be started
up. This will give employment to hun
dreds of men.
THEIR FEES CUT DOWN
Judge Coffey Allowed Attorneys
Moore and Barry but
$15,000.
They Originally Asked $37,500 for
Services to the Pearsons
.Estate.
From 137,500 to $3010 is the reductior
Judge Coffey yesterday ' made in the feei
asked for by the attorneys engaged in the
litigation over the estate of Hiram A.
Pearsons. J. H. Moore, the leeal adviser
of the executor of the estate, and Colonel
Barry, representing the absent heirs, some
time ago put in c.aims, the former for
$25,000 and the latter for $12,500. Hia
Honor, however, decided that Barry waa
entitled to but ssooo, and as he has already
received that amount that be may now
> consider that tne estate owes him nothing.
Mr. Moore stands charge! with $6690, so
Â« that be will have to content himself with
an additional $3010.
There was a large attendance of attor
neys in Judge Coffey 's courtroom yester
day afternoon when the Pearsons case
was taken ud and they spent an anxious
hour awaiting the decision of the court.
His Honor held that most of tne services
for which Mt. Moore asked for remuner
ation were duties which should have been
performed by the executor of the estate,
and that while he did not doubt their
value be conid not under the law se? the
v?ay clear to making the estate pay Mr.
Moore for them. He said the attorney
should look to th<Â» executor for his pay.
With reference to Colonel Barry's claim,
it was remarked on going over the ac
count, that he had performed duties
whicn should have b en delegated to the
attorneys representing other interests than
those which be wÂ»3 appointed to defend.
Judge Coffey proposed, however, that
the various orphan asylums the duties of
wjiose lawyers had been performed by
Colonel Barry should present to him a
statement of the amounts they were to
have paid to their lawyers, and that he
would allow to Colonel Barry that amount
out of the estate. The lawyers whose fees
were thus to be wrested from them were
Joseph Hutchirmon, representing the San
Francisco Ladies' Protective and Relief
Soctety; G. W. Haight, representing the
Ban Francisco Protestant Orphan Asylum;
Joseph Naphtaly, representing the He
brew Orphan Asylum; A. M. Drown, rep
resenting the Maria Kip Orphanage; ana
A. H. Lotiehborouu'h and M. C. Hasslett,
r^tuesentifig the Catholic Orphan Asylum.
M^ lien Judge Coffey made the announce
nÂ»ntÂ» just stated Colonel Barry imme
ofc'ely disclaimed that the cervices be
haHLrendered should have been performed
by his confreres an>i disclaimed putting
any such light on the matter, bat quickly
subsided when it became apparent to him
that >he court was indulging in a little
quiet fun at his expense.
Garret McEuerney objected on behalf
of his clients to the settlement of the ac
count of the executor, including thn items
of $75,000 distributed to the different
orphan asylums under the order of court,
which order was subsequently overruled
by the Supreme Court, ii was decided to
so arrange that partiai distribution may
be nad on Tuesday next, when two-third's
of the esiate will be turned over to the
heirs, a sufficient amount, however, being
retained in the hands of the executor to
meet the charity legacies and possible
future expenditures. The question of the
settlement ot tiie executor's account will
come up on November 17.
TEACHERS AND TALK.
Dissatisfied About Lecturers and Pen-
Blonsâ A Principal's Beard.
Yesterday afternoon's session of the
Teachers,' Institute was taken up by an ad
c'rens delivered by Professor Raymond,
formerly of Iliiuois. The subject chosen
was: "Drill asid Conquest; a Comparison
of Military Methodb ana tiie Progress of
Education."
Professor Raymond was introduced by
Superintendent Babcock, who prefaced
his remarks by saying that the teachers
had better take a good look at Joe O'Con
nor, principal of tne Horace Mann School,
who having lost an election bet will sacri
fice his beard. Fvery one who has seen
his sweeping hirsute appendage will know
that the carrying out of the bet will in
volve considerable sacrifice and devotion
to principle on the part of Mr. O'Connor.
There is much complaint among the
teachers about the speakers, or "half
broken-down <ducators," as they prefer to
allude to them, that are chosen to address
the institute. In other counties the
schools are given a vacation during the
sessions of institutes, whiota last three
days, but in this City it is quite different.
The pupils are dismissed at the noon
hour and a certain n rnt>er of afternoons
are taken to make up the requ.site times
The teachers complain that he speaker,
chosen are not practical and generally
what they have to say has no reference to
school life.
Tliey would much prefer that the
speaker should be chosen irom their own
schools, and consider it a pity to be calling
on outside speakers, who "talk with a
snuffle and can't break away from tueir
notes."
Tue Superintendent of Schools is, they
say, not to blame in the m.it.er, as the
men eh sen to speak come to him with
strong letters of indorsement and beg the
privilege 01 addressing tue teachers.
Althougu the great body of teachers
attend the se-aions, they teel ihat little
benefit is derived, and generally come
armed with tue newspapers and a batch
of yarn.
After the adjournment of yesterday's
session there was a meeting of teachers
interested in the pennon bill passed by
the last Legislature. Tbey were there for
the purpose of introducing an amendment
to the bill an'i to form a committee to
meet with the Board of Education aud de
cide as to the capacity or incapacity of
the teachers applying for pensions. The
amendment was* suggested by the fact
that mtiii. principals urge teachers to ac
cept v pension so as to make a vacancy Is
the School Department, and it was hinted
at that nianv are drawing pensions. not
really entitled to th m.
BOWEN MUST ANSWER.
The Murderer of Frank Jones
Will Stand Trial in the
District Court.
Defense Offers No EviJenc?, but Con
fident of Acquittal in the
Higher Tr bunal.
The preliminary hearing of Henry P.
Bowen, who Killed Frank Jones, second
officer of the sealing vessel Baleana, at
Herschei Island on September 1 :ast, oc
curred before United States Commissioner
Heacock yesterday. The accused was held
to answer before the District Court to the
charge of murder.
Assistant United States Attorney Bert
Scblessinger conducted tne case for the
Government, though little ii any evidence
other than what has already beÂ»n pub
ished was introduced. It was shown that
Jones had provoked the quarrel, though
just preceding the shooting he had ex
pressed a willingness to let the whole
affair drop.
Captain Williams of the Balaena was
probably the strongest witness offered by
the Government. He swore that on July
15 Bowen had threatened to kill Jones,
wbich tnreat the captain thought of suffi
cient importanca to enter in the logbook.
On cross-examination it was developed
that on the day in question Jones had
choked Bowen, but the captain had not
made a note of it, because "it would takÂ«
up a page." It was also bnoiiEht out that
Bowen nad told Captain Williams that he
(Bowen) was willing to lee the matter
drop if Jones was willing.
The remaining jwitnesses examined by
the Government were John Mapes, An
tone Lopes and Arthur Huntley, all offi
cers of the Balaena. They swore to the
fact of the killing, and as to the frequent
quarrels between the two men. Lopes
said that jt:st after the shooting Bowen
had given Mm a package of papers and
books to throw overboard, and that he bad
done as requested. The witness could
give no information as to what the papers
contained.
The Government at this point announced
its case as closed, wiiereupon Attorney
Wilson, representing the aeendant, said
be had no evidence to offer in rebu'tal at
that time. Commissioner Heacock then
ordered the prisoner into the custody ol
the Marshal, pending the bearing of his
case in the United Suites District Court.
Mason Given Eighteen Months.
Edward Mason, who last week was convicted
in the United States District Court of usir.g
the mails for fraudulent purposes, must serve
a term of eighteen months in San Quentin and
pay a fine of $500. This is the sentence im
posed by Judge Morrow yesterday. Borne
months ago Mason wrote to Mrs. Caroline
Christie of Warren, Mass., to the effect tjhat
her son, Everett Christie, had been lujuredrt*
a railroad accident and was suffering for life's
necessaries. The writer thought that $100
would about fill the biil, ana this sum was
accordingly forwarded. Mrs. Christie's confi
dence in Mason was considerably strength
ened by the fact that he signed himself
'Sheriff of Truckee County." Mason attempted
to play the same game on Miss Christie, but
that lady was not to be so easily caught. She
wrote to the Postmaster at Truckee and then
the whole fraud came to light. Mason had
never met young Christie, but knew that his
parents were' wealthy. Acting on this in
formation he plHyed on the sympathies of the
mother to the tune of $100.
The Jaue Gray Case.
The case of the United States against the
sealing schooner Jane Gray was submitted to
Juage Morrow yesterday for decision, the
arguments on both sides having been con
cluded. Assistant United States Attorney Sam
Knight closed for tae Government. He feels
confident of winning the case. The suit for
the forfeiture of the vessel and cargo Is sur
rounded with many intricate legal details and,
in a wtiy, is of International importance.
Hence Judge Morrow's opinion will be eagerly
watched for by those interested in such
matters.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1896.
ANOTHER CHARTER
IS NOW DEMANDED
Mayor- Elect Phelan Says
He Will Wcrk to
Get One.
This Will B? the Ma n Object
of His Administra
tion.
THE DECKS ARE ALL CLEARED.
Adoption of Constitutional Amend
ments Will Give the Citizens a
Chance to Act
James D. Phelan, the newly elected
Mayor of San Francisco, was busy receiv
ing guests yesterday. Ho acknowledged
the congratulations of his friends and
supDnrters with becoming modesty and
HON. JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor-Elect of San Francisco, Who
Wants a New Charter.
said he hoped to prove worthy of the con
fidence that the people have reposed in
him.
The quiet habits of Mr. Phelan are well
known. He dresses in a style becoming a
man of w-altn, wears a well-fitting busi
ness suit of dare material, with a carna
tion pink in the buttonhole of his sack
coat. He adopts the regulation standing
collar, but is not extravagant in the mat
ter of neck-scarfs, though they are always
hand-tied and of solid colors. He smokes
good cigars and lives well.
Mr. Fhelan said it was his earnest desire
and purpose to be an acceptable Mayor to
all the people, Democrats, Republicans,
Populists, and members of other parties
alike, for the vote he received made it
manifest to him that party lines had not
been drawn in the balloting for Mayor.
There is a c<zv, comfortable air about
Mr. Phelan's oftice on the fifth floor of the
Phelan building aud every politician in
the City will know in a week that the
number of his room is 301.
As a gentleman of taste who is able to
gratify all of his reasonable wishes Mr.
Phelan has surrounded himself with
many admirable objects of art. The most
important work is a landscape by William
Keith, showing a vista under the dark
overhanging trees that Keith loves so well
to shadow forth on his rich canvas.
In a prominent position is a bust of the
late James Phelan, father of the newly
elected Mayor. It is of pure marble, is
the work of an eminent scnlptor, and
stands on a graceful base of lapis lazuli
beneath a portrait of the same gentleman.
Other tokens of the future Mayor's filial
devotion are to be seen in different parts
of his office.
Amon.- the art treasures are fully a
dozen oil paintines and sketches in crayon
and water colors by teachers and students
of the Hopkins Art Institute, while a
place <if honor is accorded to a pen and
ink cartoon by Frank A. Nuntcivel, for
merly of Thk Call's art 3taff, represent
ing the untimely cutting down of a prom
ising Cupid by a stalwart young Amazon
wearing a modern bloomer costume.
Mr. Phelan is an eligible bachelor, and
his choice of this suggestive theme may
be noted with advantage by the young
ladies who have the pleasure of his ac
quaintance.
Above a carved bookcase is perched a
bronze bust. "1 bought that for a Na
poieon," said Mr. Phelan, "but I have
seen better. From this distance it looks
more like Major McKinley or General de
Young than it does like the great Corsi
can."
In a nook slightly withdrawn from pub
lic gaze is a beautifully mounted terres
trial globe, which may or may not indi
cate the Bcope oi Mr. Pbelan's prospective
ambitions. Certainly if he had been
"asking for the earth" in the recent cam
paign hi* fellow-citizens by a lar^je major
ity manifested their willingness to grant
his request.
When asked what special objects would
receive bis attention during his adminis
tration Mr. Phelan said that if there is
one thing he would luce to accomplish it
would be the framine and adoption of a
suitable and acceptable charter for the
City of San Francisco.
"This proposed charter could not be put
in force during ray terra of office, and
therefore I am free to advocate it," said
Mr. Pheltn. "If we can get the Oity on
the ri ht road for self-government it will
be the greatest accomplishment for gobd
that can be sug e-tcl so far as municipal
affairs are concerned
"I re ard the adoption of a new charter
of paramount importance, and with the
lesson taught by Tuesd i.v's election an in
strument ought io be framed, 1 think, that
would be acceptable Â«.o tne majority of the
people. By el niinating gome of the ob
jectionable provisions of the char er just
defeated and remodeling other parts, in
order to better subserve the public wel.are,
the york ought to be accomplished.
'"I regard it as a fortunate thing for this
ments referring to the government of the
City and County of San Francisco have
been adopted, for ibis action tiy the people
clears the deck for action in such a way
that a new charter may be Â«d >pted within
two vtars. Such is my opinion. I not.cc
that City Attorney Creswell holds to
the opinion that a special election
cannot be called <o choose a Board of
Freeholders to frame a charter, but
can be cahed only to fill a vacancy,
but I think he ismslaken. Tha; ques.iun
will be invesUKated fully and tho courts
wih probabiy be caiied upon to pass upon
the nia.ter, provided other arrangements
are completed for uroceeding with the
framing of the proposed charter.
"Everybody kimws what a lamentable
condition our City Government is in at
the present time owini; to the frequent
and conflicting amendments to the con
solidation aci, under which we are irying
lo conduct our municipal business, sup
plemented by the almost innumerable
decisions of tne courts in regard to dis
puted points. I do Dot believe it is possible
for any one to decide intelligently just what
the present system of municipal law pro
vides. Thisisshown by the frequence of the
appeals made to the couris lor interpreta
tions of provisions that ought to be olear
to '"very citiz -n.
"There are other things that are worthy
of attention by tiie Mayor, and to them I
shall bring whatever ability I may possess.
"I have made a campaign against the
waste and extravagance which is the cause
of high taxation existing now in our City
government, and I have not hesitated to
point out t'.e betrayal of the City's Inter
ests by the Board of Supervisors. I be
lieve that the public on Tuesday elected
good men 10 the Board of Supervisors. I
think it is the beÂ«t board ihat has been
chosen fora lon^ tune. I am well satisfied
with he personnel of the incoming Board
of Supervisors.
"1 have made a campaign against the
quasi-public corporations, not because I do
not believe they have rights, but because I
know they have duties toward the public
which they nave not performed. They
should keep their hands off the Board of
Supervisors; they should pay their just
share of taxation ; they should char c only
reasonable rates for their service, and now,
having been elected by the public, without
any assistance -rom this source whatever,
I am free to deal with them as the repre
sentaive of the City.
"ActUHted no less by a sense of duty
than a sense of the deepest and most pro
found gratitude to the people who Have
expressed their confidence in my candi
dacy I shall endeavor to represent the City
faithfully upon all occasions.
"Under the power of supervision of the
several office* conferred by the consolida
tion act I will see that Â»be municipal of
fices are conducted without extravagance,
waste, favoritism or corruption; that the'
taxation be placed where it belongs, and
that the revenue of the City be expended
for the economical maintenance of the
municipal establishments and for the
general progress and welfare of our great
City."
Mr. Phelan says that his plan will be
during his term of office to keep the citi
zens informed on all matters pertaining to
their public interests, and by thus taking
the people into his confidence he expects
to induce them to co-operate wit him in
advancing the welfare of tlie community.
COURSING.
Postponement of the Ocean View

Owing to the action of some malicious
person in cutting the fences surrounding
Ocean View Coursing Park on Wednesday
night and permitting all but a few of the
bared to escape, there will be no running
at that popular resort to-morrow. All
preparations had been made for a fine

the meeting was postponed.
It was the original intention to close on
Sunday, the 15th inst., out of courtesy to
the Interstate Club, which goes to Mer
ced on the day previous, but roost of those

A GREAT DAY'S
SPORT ASSURED
The Thanksgiving Day
Regatta Will Now Be
a Success.
Entries From All the Prominent

JAMES D. PHELAN EEFEEEE.
All the R^ces Will Be Over in Time
for Visiiors to Reach the Foot
ball Gime.
All donbls about the success of the
coming Tnanksgiving regatta. have passed
away, and there is now every prospect of
its being t c greatest event of the kind
that has ever taken place on San Francisco
Bay.
Mayor-elect James D. Phelan will act as
referee, assisted by Charles G. Yale, who
has acted as referee in so many boat races
of the past.
The races will be rowed in Oakland
Creek, probably the best course on the
coast. The start will be from a point
about a quarter of a mile from tha foot of
Broadway, and will be a mile and a naif
long with a turn, except in the old-timers'
race, which will be three-quarters of a
mile straight away.
The "giants" of Stockton, champion
senior bar^e crew, A. G. Brow, the cham
pion single sculler, and the champion
! junior four-oared crew, all of Stockton,
i will be in competition with the local oars
! men. Tiieie is 1 real cv iosity to see how
j the wonderful four-oareu barge will act on
J the waters of the bay. The Sontn Ends
: are determined to have as sood a boat
I built here if possible, in order to be on
even terms witu the btockton boys.
A very interesting feature of this regatta
wiil be a six-oared cutter race between the
first and second divisions of the Naval
j Reserve. Mr. Pembroke, the P. A. A.
1 rowing Commissioner leels satisfied he
j can obtain a cup or pennant that shall be
I known as a challenge trophy, to be rowed
I for every* year, or twice a year, by crews of
the Naval Battalion. There will also be a
very interesting race between wdl-known
former single-scull oarsmen. Qu.te a
number have promised to try their skill
again.
The programme (subject to changes) will
be about as follows: Four-oared intermedi
ate, senior single scull. Benior four-oared
barge, six-oared cutter race, Naval Re
serve, junior uutrigger skiff race, senior
outrig er skiff race and old-timers' race.
All race boats will be taken over free on
the 8:15 or 9:15 boat, narrow-gauge. The
tirst race Will start at 10:45 a. m. ana
people taking the 10:15 narrow-gauge boat
will be in time to see the start. Mayor
elect Phelan has presented a valuable
silver cup for the single-sculi event and
the Southern Pacilic Railroad has made a
handsome contribution for prizes, while
Auditor Broueiick has also presented a
nne trophy.
Every pr;ze will be valuable and will be
re.idy for the vinner at the conclusion of
the regatta^
Besides the crews from Stockton the
University of California, the Alameda,
South End, Ariel, Dolphin and possibiy
the Pioneer clubs will be represented. It
is the intention to nave the races over in
time for spectators to get lunch and be
I able to see the football game in the aiter
noon between the teams from the Stan
ford and California universities.
MR. WETJEN OUTRAGED,
He Has Written a Communica
tion Concerning a
Rumor.
Which Was, Hs Says, in Keeping
With the Dirty Work by Which
He Was Defeated.
Cord J. Wetjen has written a communi
cation for the information of ris friends
and the publ.c generally, which is as
follows:
Editor Call: I am Informed that some un-
Bcrupulous rascal or rascals circulated a report
thai I had commlued suicide.
The rumor was first circulated Thursday
morning, and notwithstanding that every
effort wuÃ made by my friends to denyit.it
was persisted in all thai day and the next,
thereby proving that it was something more
tuan a hoax. Myse.i and numerous friends
are endeavoring to trace up the source of this
detestable "joke," and I desire to say to my
in.iiiisauJ.il:- pubic that I expect to have
sufficient evidence in a short time to make
tmiws interesting for those who are guilty of
this dasiardly attempt to ingbten my lamily
and Injure my reputation as a man.
I desire to Miy to my friends, through your
valuable paper, that I have not committed
suiiid- and do not intend to do anything so
cowardly.
Ii the party or parties who are responsible
for this had met witu defeat, they, Denig
coward.*, would in all likelihood have done
what they attribute to me.
All tha'. I cai. ssy is that this is in keeping
witft the dirty wont used to defeat me, and I
firmly believe emanates from toe same source.
When I Â«ay dirty wort was used to bring about
my defeat, 1 aoso advisedly. I have evidence
in my possession that trickery was resorted to
before and after the election.
1 nope, Mr. Editor, tnat you will give this
letter publicity, 6O that my friends and the
public may know the true state oi affairs, aud
I farther desire to thank my friends for the
valuable assistance given me, and beg of thorn
to take no slow in any rUmor they may hear
concerning me.

SEEKING AN ACCOUNTING.
J. 11. Smith and the Financing or the
Ferries and Cliff House Road.
The case of J. Howard Smith against
the Ferries an l Cliff Railway wa* argued
orally in the Supreme Court yesterday.
The case was submitted once before and
was ordered resubraitied. Mr. Smith
seeks an accounting for the purpose of de
termining how much the road actually
cost, how it was paid for, under what cir
cumstances, and to what amounts stocks
and bonds were issued and how they have
been disposed of, and all other facts con
cerning the financing of the road.
The arguments occupied the entire day,
P. J. Galpin. Mr. Smith, Robert i.
Hayne, E. F. Preston and C. P. Eells, the
lust three named representing the railway
company, being in court.
This litigation has been in progress five
years. The prr.sent phase is a demurrer
which Mr. Smijh asks the Supreme Court
to overrule. The railway company's at
torneys argued in opposition to Mr. Smith
the statute of limitations, and also that
M. Smith, having receive some of the
stock after a certain date, was not qualified
to bring suit against the directors. Toe
case was submit eri.
THE O'MALLEYS Hi JAIL
They Have Again Opened Up
Their Feud With the
McGuires.
This Time the Boss of the House Eas
Whipped Dennis O'Day, His
Landlord.
The O'Malley and McGuire feud has again
.broken out, aad the former (husband and wife),
representing the aggressive faction, are in jail.
The cnarge of assau.t to murder Is booked
against the male O'Malley and the lighter
ctiargeof assault with a d adly weapon stands
against the fair name of Mrs. Margaret O'Mal
ley.
About ten days ago the O'Malleys of Clem
entina street carried on in such high style
th .t Officers Grennan ana Patrick McNamara
found it necessary to drop in upon them.
The unsought-for visit was resented with
broomsticks and other houseaold utensils to
the great discomfiture of the policemen, who
are now nursing broken heads.
This pievious a f f li r is still pending as a
matter to be attended to by the Police Court,
and in the meantime Mr. and Mrs. O'Maliey
have been at large on bail, making further
records for themselves.
Dennis O'Dny, the landlord of the house the
O'Malleys have been occupying, called upon
bis tenants and requested their surrender of
the premises.
Mr. O'Malley met Mr. O'Day and, Punch
like, beat him in good shape with the tail end
of a hod. Mrs. Kate McGuire witnessed the
assault and protested against it, whereupon
she was promptly struck down by Mrs. O'Mal
ley, who was accused of executing a jig upon
her prostrate form.
The O'Mulleys are again unde? arrest in con
sequence of taa deeds just related.

BOTH HAD HEART TROUBLE,
THE DOCTOR DIED BUT THE
PATIENT RECOVERED.
An I'nusually Interesting Case That
Borders Upon the Marvelous.
From the Press, < orning, lowa.
Sympathetic heart trouble completely and
permanently cured sounds ike a myih or a
iairy talc, and yei this was actually accom
plished in the case of Miss Jennie Cox of
Corning, lowa. Tnis lady is very enthusi
astic In spt-akinsr of her recovery, and when
a reporter called upon her she readily gave
the following statement of her wonderiul
cure:
"Yes, sir, your information in regard to my
being cured of heart disease is correct. For
tive years I was afflicted with sympathetic
Heart trouble. I would suddenly become
faint, my heart would cease to oeat, and I
ronld scarcely catch my br?ath. I would lie
down, and only by the most arduous and
diligent work could my friends resuscitate
me. These attacks wou d overcome me from
five to six times a week. As you are aware,
heart disease is a malady that is rarely bene
fited and irom which one seldom recovers.
In the hope of receiving mi-dical treatment
that would be beneficial. I consulted with
the ablest physicians in Minneapolis, Minn.,
and, in iact, ail the best vnyMciuns whom I
knew, but none of them could relieve me.
One physician, Dr. Deane, I especially remem
ber, seemed to thoroughly understand my case,
but, i<e the rest, was unable to cure me. He
wns afflicted similarly to myself and told me
we would, no doubt, both die from this com
plaint. He actually di-'d, as he prophesied,
about a year ago of heart disease. One day my
mother saw an advertisement oi Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills for Pale People and without much
hope ot procuring relief, but thinking perhaps
it might benefit nic a little purchnsed a box.
When I had taken haj a box I nevr had
another attack of heart trouble. In order to
be sure, I took three more boxes. This was
a year and a half aÂ«o and up to the present
time I have not had a smg.e attack of heart
trouble. I am- as positive that they cured
me as I am that I stand beiore you ti.is
moment and can truly and consistently recom
mend the remedy to ail suffering witc heart
disease. Inde d, lam only too glad to sound
tiie praises of so worthy a medicine as I con
sider Dr. Wil ams' Pink Pills. When you
take into cousidf ration the fact that my work
in a steam .laundry is, perhaps, the most ag
gravating pf any occupation upon heart dis
ease becHU.se of the heat and consequent lia
bility to fainting spells, you will readily see
how marvelous has been my cure."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, in a con
densed form, all the elements iracessary to
give new l.fe-and richness to the blood and
restore shattc-fed nerves. They are an unfail
ing specific for such diseases as locomotor
a.axia, partial paralyse, St. Vitus' danc*
sciatic*, neuralgia, rheumatism, nervous
headache, the after-effect of ia grippe, palpi
tation of i he heart, pala f.nd sallow complex
ions, all forms of weakness either in male or
female. Pink Piils are sold by all dealers, or
will bo sent postpaid on receipt of price (50
cents a box, or six boxe^ for $2 50â they aro
never sold in bulk or by the 100), by address

CHICAGO MAKKETS.
CBICAGO. Tt.i.. Nov. 6.-The bull sentiment
in wheat, which *ufter.'d by yesterday's decline,
was fully restored at the opening to day, and
during the aessl in increased In intensity. Liver-,
pool not only disregarded our yesterday's w<a'<
ness, but was quoted firm and i.^ii higher at the
s. art and cioted 1 i,4d hieher. At the same time
a notably strong stock market at New York con
vey.-d confidence o grain ad indued considerable
buying. The N. rrhwes: rt-cipts. 684 cars, being
much smaller than on last Friday or on the cor
responding d*y in 3 895, were of importance In
determining the cou se of thÂ» market. Receipts
1 1 Chicago were ligh at 87 cars, and* 17,000
bn?bels were taken from store.
St. Louis and other outside markets were up
and, apparently so, independent of Cbicnco.
Necessarily tbis but added to the buying ardor
a.d served to keep prices jumping. Exports tvnÂ«
light, only 113,273 bushels clearing, nil Conti
nental markets were lower. In the last fifteen
minutes the day'n bul.Â«e culminated, December,
touching "^â¢/8 . The opening on thai option was
from 75 to 751.4 c, the range being between 74%
and 78S/ B e. and the close at 78@78Vic. 3% *4c
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts lor
to-morrow 113 cars. No. 2 red spot ranged from
79% to 84S/ c, closing from 83 to 84c.
C'Â»i;N âvv as urged upward by â¢ the strength of
the speculative tone of the larger market. There
was no independent motive for sirens?, or firm
ness in the situation and consequently there was
an utter absence of enthuÂ«laim to the buying.
Receipts were 3.8 <ars and 353 751 busbeis were
ia*en from sure. Liverpool cab quoted i/*a
advance. Export clearances were 550 786 bushels.
May corn opened from 28 V2 0 to 8S' B e. so d be
tween 28V4@-9yBC closing at 29Â® .9' Â» , ! }i@%c
higher than yesterday. Es.ima.etl receipts tor
to-morrow 3.0 cars.
OAT: â PartooK of the firmness of wheat, but
was lscÂ»lnÂ« in activity, so thai prices moved in a
slugsisb manner. Receipt* were 368 cars. There
were no withdrawals from store. .May oats closed

1 BUN'S BEVIJEW OF TRADE. ( .
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 6.-R. G. Dun ft Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
A ereai revolution has been effected this wee* In
tbe conditions which control business It could
not be in any fair decree reflected as yet In tran
sactions or 011 records, but there is ample evidence
already that a crushing weight has been lifted and
roll, d away and the business world has adjusied
Itself to a state of freedom a id security which it
bas not known for years, and new contracts iu

millions which had been hoarded, and tlip collapse
of the interest rate from 8 and 12 to 6V4 per cent
and the greal demand for American . stctirl.les on
foreigti account are suns of more lasting promise.
It. wÂ»- not strictly logical that wheat aJvanced

-358, against 1,790,833 last year. -
. A crowing disposition appear-, among farmers to
hold wheat for better prices than are now realized,
although at prose if any advance checks buying
for export, -r- peculation In cotton was also excited
on the theory that mills won id now start up and
would make a large demand for goods, but the ad
vance was met by realizing sales and a slight reac
tion. It will be all the better for business If orient
hopes do not hoist prices too fast. i The election
immediately stiffened prices Of pig iron, which
reached SI 2 at Plltsuurg for bessemer, and the
certainty that, many - orders ; for buildings and
bndse* and other finishi-d forms would now be
come operative caused some advance.
- 1 lie future or this trade depends upon the ex
tent of increase in the demand for ' finished prod
ucts of iron : and steel, which is lively to |g- ma
ter. ally affected by the cou se purÂ»u*d ; by various
combinations, ihe billet pool, which is 9 ill openly

In session here and Is suia to have changed Its
bÂ»s:s oi allotment so as to secure fairer results.
The nail cumblnat.ou is now threatened with a
hostile league of jobbers and producers and is
openly undersold. -.The bar cumb'ina.lon, notwith
standing Us large rebate, is still demauulng more
han Hit- prices at which steel bars are sold In
great quantities. A slight advance in sheeting*
and print cloths is the only change which yet ap
pears In the marker for cotton goods, and ptactl
caily no change has yet appeared in woolens.
Failures for the week have been 230 In the
United States against 280 last year, and 52 in

livelier and the Jobbers' teams are busily engaged
making deliveries, us housekeepers generally are
tilling their bins laying in their winter supplies.
Quotations remain unchanged for all domestic
grades, but for steam uses there Is a tendency up
ward, as the importa.ion cost of ail foreign giades
is increasing The liberal : shlpn.ent- Â»hk have
been made for the past several m- n'.hs from Aus
tralia and Swansea, the major portion of which
has come to hÂ»nd, isjno being replaced las fast as
same arrived here. some of these many car.;oe.|
have been. disposed of at absurdly low Drlces and
have caused a depression In values, but the lowest
has been reach. -d and a reaction has set in and
much better prices for steam Coals are assured,
freights from England and Austialla have been
marked up and sales have recently been made at
figures showing an advance. Our manufacturing

received the following letter of thanKs for
their action:
To the Hon. President and Mtmbtn of the City
Councilâ Dear Sirs: Tne pall of grief in siiil
upon our household, in our loneliness |
we have not forgotten our duty to your honor- I
able and sympathetic bo'iy, but have i"clayed
our acknowledgment because each attempt j
has only added intensity to our t-o: row. It is;
with full and aching hearts that we here- I
with extend to you our deepest gratitude lor
the high respect and esteem In which you
have enthroned the memory of a beloved hus
band and father.
Next to his own presence In our home we
ho.d sacred the beautiful and touching memo
rial and resolution' presented by you, his as
sociate!) in public office and private liie. We
realize t'rat the voice of the council is the
voice of the city of Oakland, therefore in
thanking you we thank the citizens of Oak

The floral offering was so beautiful in de
sign and workmanship â "The vacant chair"â
typical of his seat in your council chambers
and at our fireside, is full of sweetest memo
ries to his family. While our loss is greater
than language can adequately portray, yet
one consolation is proportionate only to the
high esteem in which he was held by all who
knew him. Respectfully and gratefully,
Mrs. E. S. Capell ajtd FamiLT.
Personal Property Tax.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 6. â Auditor

Political Code made by the las; Legisla
ture he is virtually responsible for tne en
tire personal prooerty tax roll. Section
3831, which by the charter is made to
apply to tbe City Auditor, reads:
Within fifteen days alter the first Monday in |
August of each yeÂ«r the Auditor of the county, !
or city and county, must make a careful ex- ,
amiuatlon oi the assessment book or books of :
tbe county, or city and county, and ascertain '
therefrom the amount or amounts of all taxes I
that should huve been collected by the Asses
sor in pursuance of this chapter and which
have not been collected. He must then state
an account to tLe Assessor and demand from j
him that the amount or amounts so remaining j
uncollected shall be paid into the county
treasury within fifteen days from the date of
said demand. If, at the expiration ol said
time, the Assessor has not settled lor and paid !
raid amount or amounts into the treasury as |
aforesaid the District Attorney must com- i
mence an action in the proper court against !
the Assessor and his bondsmen for the recov- j
cry of said amount or amounts so remaining
unco.it cted ; and upon the trial of such action
-no defense shall be admissible except that the !
assessment or assesments are illegal, invalid
or void.
Taxpayers Money Saved.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 6.â Connty
Clerk Frank C. Jordan has saved Ala
rr.eda County no less tnan $15,000 in get
ting out the new great register, and by a
little foresight has added another $4000 to
the credit side of the ledger in the matter
of election supplies. Under previous
officers the ereat registers and all election
supplies have been mutilated, destroyed,
mislaid or stolen. As are ult a new sup
ply had to be purchased at each election.
Mr. Jordan made all election officers give
a receipt for the supplies, and held them
personally responsible for their return.
Very nearly everything was returned and
is being boxed up and put away for future
use. â

HOT THE FAULT
OF OFFICIALS
Travels of a Letter That
Went to England With
a Faulty Address.
Although Containing No Name or
Direction the Sender Was
Cleverly Found.
MUCH RED-TAPE NECESSARY.
But It Only Serv.s to Show the Per
fection of Detail of International
Postal Systems.
Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. tt, f
A letter covered with postmarks and
searebmarks reached Oakland yesterday
and was returned to the sender, after hav
ing traveled a distance equal to a circuit
of the globe. It served as an interesting
object Jesson in demonstrating the per
fection oi detail which exists in the inter
national postal system. Inadvertently the
name of tbe town in England where the
party resides to whom the letter was ad
dressed was omitted. After sixty days,
although there was nothing in the con
tents of the letter cither by signature or
by address to show who wrote it, it was
returned to the sender.
On September 24 a letter directed to Mrs.
A. E. Smith, Clarence "Villa, Hertford
shire, England, was mailed in the Oakland
office. In due time it arrived at Hertford,
which is the county town of the shire
wnere the party resides. Three days were
spent in searching, but with no success,
and the letter was marked "Not known,
F. H." and returned to the dead-letter
office in London. There it was opened,
but no names could be found in it to indi
cate the sender. It was branded '-Insuffi
ciently addressed" and returned to New
York. Another search there was made,
but nothing more definite than "Toots,
Oakland," was found by way of signature.
AÂ« it was not likely that "Tools" or
Birdie" could be found in a directory, or
would be known to letter-carriers, the let
ter was simply returned to the Oakland
office.
Thvtn another search was made. The
letter contained a money order, which, of
course, cave no information as to the
sender or the party to whom it was sent.
It was, however, supposed by Postmaster
White that th<Â» sender of tbe money order
â would most likely De the party who wrote
the letter. The rules of the postofnee,
however, are very strict regarding the
identity of the sender of a money order,
as this is its only safeguard. A special re
port had to oe made out, statinc why, in
this particular instance, the rule was
broken, and this report had to be for
warded to Washington.
The order was found to have been issued
to a eontleman who had no difficulty in
proving that he was "Toots :> and that
"Birdif ' was his sister, and on this show
ing the letter was delivered to him. After
signing a long affidavit setting forth that
he was the party referred to as "Toots"
and swearing that he was the legitimate
owner of the letter, it was returned to
him, after having traveled for fifty-nine
days and being within twelve miles of
what was intended should be its destina
tion.
RUNNING STUFFED HARES
The Humane Society Has Been
Invited to Be in At

A Display of Live Bhres Coursed by
Fox Terriers Will Also Be
Made.
The directors of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty t o Animals are to be
the guests of the San Francisco Fox
terrier Coursing Club to-morrow afternoon
at the Presidio Athletic grounds.
The club people, who are now 412
strong, and include the better element of
the sport-loving publicâ bankers, whole
sale me rcnants and lawyers â have de
cided that they want once for all to have
an understanding with the authorities as
to the legitimacy of the fox-terrier run
ning which they inaugurated a few
months ago.
They claim that the terriers are less
likely to catch live hares, and even when
catching them they kill with more dis
patch and less patn than do the hounds.
It Is this test they wish to submit to
morrow to tbe decision of the officers of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.
The owners of fox terriers in this City
are asked to bring them along. There is
to be no admission fee, and it is desirable,
for the benefit of tbe new sport, that the
critics see tbe work of dogs untrained and
that have never chased a hare.
The regulation stuffed hare, such as
was ran Â«t tbe end of a string some weeks
ago, will again be coursed between runs of
the live game.

ANOTHER COUNTY
WANTS THE BANNER
Marin Thinks That Alame
da Is Not Entitled
to It
But Oakland Republicans Laugh
at Their Near Neigh
bor's Claim.
There is trouble brewing over the ban
ner that is coming from Los Angeles, and
which the Oakland Republicans expect to
carry in the great ratification parade to
night. Marin claims the honor of being
the banner county of the State, ana the
"stalwarts" in and about Sausalito assert
that they are going to have the trophy, no
matter what comes or goea. According to
the votes cast, Marin has a better per
centage than Alameda, and should be en
titled to the flag.
"If the returns are correct, and 1 guess
they are, Marin is entitled to that banner,
and we proposa getting it," said C. C.
Bruce of Bruce, Bowen & Co., yesterday.
"In round figures Alameda polled 66^g
per cent of ail the votes cast for the Re
publican ticket, while Marin polled 66^
per cent. Now, unless there is some
string to that emblem of victory it should
come to our side of the bay, and that at
once. Oakland shall not shine in bor
rowed plumes if I can ho !p it, and when
the flag arrives to-day at 4 p. m. we propose
to be there to receive it.
"Of cours Marin has not anything like
as many voters as Alameda, but then we
have a great many more Democratic
voters in our county than the Oakland
boys have in theirs. We had thus to work
all the harder for our victory, and Mariu
deserves the flag and the title of 'the ban
ner county.' lamon my way now to the
rooms oi the State Central Committee,
and I am sure the members will look into
the matter. I may bt> under a misappre
hension and have mistaken the conditions
under which Mr. Denison gave the flag.
Nevertheless Alameda must not claim the
title of 'the banner couuty.' "
The whole matter promises to develop
into quite a lively controversy, and Cap
tain Bruce is quite sure he has the better
end of it. He was to have gone for a short
cruise on his yacht, the Rover, to-day, Out
has changed his mind and will go to Oak
land to meet the banner instead. It was
Bruce who made the tight of State Sen
ator-elect Dickinson, and the majority
given that gentleman shows now well he
did his work.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. ftâ A report
reached this city to-night that Marin
Couuty would claim the RepuDlican ban
ner when it arrived in Oakland to-morrow.
Marin's claim, it is said, is based on the
percentage of the total vote in the county.
By this calculation Marin declares that
Btie polled a larger Republican vote in
proportion Io tne number of votes cast
than Aiameda County recorded.
"Marin County evidently does not un
derstand the terms by which that banner
can be won," said Senator Denison to
night. "Tlvj right to that banner is with
tne county that gives the largest numeri
cal Republican majority. I have not
heard that Marin County's majority ex
ceeded 5000 or that she polled even half of
that vote all told.
"If Marin County thinks she has a right
to that banner she has a perfect rieht to
set forth the claim. At any rate, even by
the percentage calculation it would only
be courteous for them to wait until the
official canvass is announced."
The following dispatch was received at
the County Central Committee rooms to
night:
Ravenna, Cal., November 6.
Hon. Eli S. Denison, Oakland; Hearty con
gratulations on your splendid triumph in
Alameda. Large party leaves Los Angeles to
night on train following me with banner for
Oakland. H. Z. Osborne.
The Baby Precinct.
DECOTO, Cal., Nov. 6.â There were
only two of the seventy-three registered
voters Â«i the "baby precinct," as Decoto
is called, who failed to place their opin
ions on record Tuesday on the National
issues. While it is a strong Republican
precinct the vote for the Democratic can
didate for Supervisor ran away ahead of
his opponent, owing to some rumors that

NOSE FINISHES
AT INGLESIDE
A Large Crowd Saw the
Best Day's Racing of
the Season.
The Specterlike Tea Rose Beaten
a Nose by the Crack
Libertine.
A HEW TRACK RECORD MAD 7
Indio, Tenacity and Can't Dance Carry
the Corrigan Colors to Victory.
Ostler Joe Out for an Airing.
The judges at Ingleside were kept busy
yesterday separating horses that finished
noses apart on the wire, and seldom has a
finer day's racing been witnessed in Cali
fornia. From a time standpoint the furi
ous finish between the proud Libertine
and Tea Rose, a lightning fast little two
year-old, daughter of imp. Midlothian,
in the owners' handicap at five and a half
furlon s, eclipsed all of the other per
formances. There were but three entries
to this event, the two snrinters named and
J. Naglee Burkes Belicoso. The two-year
(l :, with eighty-four pounds in the sad
dle, was giviiu' Libertine, with ninety- tive
pounds up, fifteen pou:idt-.
Bellicoso, ridden by Jones, carried 96
pounds. The betting iavored Libertine,
who opened at 7 to 10 and at one time
was as good as cv n money. Bellicoso
was well supported ai 3 to 2, and the little
filly's friends, who were legion, torced her
price down from Bto6to I. Little time
was spent at the SOftt, the trio quickly
being dispatched, with the iavorite slow
est to break. Oft iike a shadow, Tea Rose
led the way, followed by Beilicoso, Â»he
three furlongs being stepped off in 34
seconds. At the bead of the stretch Lib
ertine began closing on the leader, but
she led him one of the msrriest hunts he
ever had.
Su sure was Pat Reidy that de had the
race won that ne turned in the sadule to
get a glimpse of Libsrtine, and very soon
the youth had a better view of him. Foot
by foot the bay overtook the two-year-old
and just as the wire was reached his nose
showed in front. BeliicoÂ«o was two
lengths away. The time, 1:06%, in now
the Ingleside track record and is within a
fraction of a second of the Coast record.
The race developed the fact that Tea
Rose, although not partial to weight, is
possessed ol a marvelous turn of speed,
bordering on the phenomenal. The win
ner ran the five funongs in one minu c
flat, the las; quar;er being covered in 23^
seconds, showintr that Galen Brown's pride
has lost none of his oid-time steam and
propelling qualities.
The other events were equally as well
contested, the big crowd being kept keyed
up to a hii:h piich of excitement. Favor
ites took five of ihe six iaces. The Jorri
gan colors were thrice carried to the front
by Indio, Tenacity and Can't Dance.
Bucked down from two to even money.
In dio waded through his field from one of
the rear positions and placed the opening
fiyv-furlong scramble for two-year-oids to
his credit. True Blue was second and the
500 to 1 shot, Jerilderio, third.
Old Strathmeatb, allowed to wander
back :.:i: .:i the betting on the second event,
over six furlongs, from fours to 8 to 1, was
another that came Irum behind in ibe run
home and goi the decision from R.cardo
by less nan, a length. Thelma, the 11 to
5 favorite, was third.
'The tempter came and he was
tempted!" Ostler Joe, a member of
Trainer Randal i's equine paradox from
the Copper City (Mont.) curriculum, fur
nished a grand exhibition of brute intelli
gence. The knowledge possessed by the
animals in the Montana trainer's charge
borders on the supernatural. They seem
to realize by the crowd that gathers
around the stall in thp paddocK that tne
public is backing them, anJ iliey imme
diately grow wise. Yesterday Ostler Joe
started in a mile da^h along with Kamsin
and three others. The latter opened at 7
to 5, and was backed down to evens.
Ostler Joe opened at 7 to 5, too, and went
back to 2to 1. Then some coin went in on
him, but very little from the iand of
mines and smelter smoke.
The Ostler easily overhauled Sabilla and

galloped into the stretch. Below the fur
long role Duffy took a conventional nan,
and ,: Kamsin : coming along passed him
and won by a few inches, apparently on
sufferance, in , lA\%. If dropp d in a
handicap in the near future and . the odds
are anywhere in the region of 1000 to 1,
i why, Ostler Joe will undoubtedly figure a
cineh â in the stable.
After this a six-furlong sprint furnished
an opportunity for another Corrigan horse
to annex a pur*e. Starting a9to 5 favor
ite Tenacity outfiniihed as well at bumped
one or two of his field through i tie stretch
and won by a short nose from Navy Blue,
a 10 to 1 chance.
The last race proved an easy thing for
Can't Dance, the 7 to 10 choice, who out
gained Peril and won somewhat handily
by a necK in 1:30 for tue seven furlongs.
â  â¦
Noes.
Tenacity, winner of the fourth race,
entered to be sold ior $300, was bid up to
$700 by Tom Boyle, owner of Navy B ue,
the second horse. Mr. Corrigan retained
the colt with the usual $5 bid.
Martinus, the steeplechase jockey who
rode the crack jumper Si. Jacob in his
Eastern and Montana engagements, ar
rived froiu the East yesterday. Martinus
jumped from obscurity to the top of the
ladder, now being considered one of the
best riders in that dangerous vocation.
St. Jacob injured a shoulder in a race at
Oakley and will shortly be shipped to
Montana. Later he may be sent to Cali
fornia to race.
The ring got slightly scorched by laying
40 to 1 a show against Jerilderio.
Naglee Burke backed his filly, Dura,
quite extensively, but she lailed to land
within the money.
True Blue ran a remarkably good race
and many thought he passed the wire
ahead of" Indio. The latter certainly did
not have any time to spare lor star-g;izing.
W Hie Martin's saddle work astride of
old Strathmeath was a most artistic piece
of work. Some of the younger knights of
the pigskin might profit by watching the
old-timer now and then.
Bob Isom was substituted for Picgott
on Therese at the request ot Mr. Spreckels.
Tea Rose worked through the stretch
on Thurs ay moniing in 22% seconds.

SACRAMENTO'S CHIEF.
Supreme Court Decision Concerning a
Salary for a Police Position.
The Supreme Court has decided the case of
Warren F. Drew against John B. Rodgers, in
voiving the office of Chief of Police of Sacra
mento. The decision was that "there is no
error in the record available to defendant and
the order appealed from should be confirmed."
Drew was elected Chief of Police for Sacra-
I memo for a term of two yea: s, from April 1,
1890, under the law which provided that in
I cn-te of a vacancy the City Trustees might fill
i by appointment until the nex r . election. At
j the city election of March, 1892. Rodgers
I received the majority of votes, and the can
i vassing board declared him elec ed, but on
i June 17, 1892, he was adjudged to be in-
I eligible by reason of Â«!ienÂ«ge. He appealed
1 and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme
; Court in De> ember, 1893.
In Ap il, 1892, Rodeers had forcibly dispos
: sessed Drew ul the office, and having subse
! quently been natu nlized. the Citj Trustees,
! iv June, 1892, mnde him Chief until the next
! city election, and at the city election of 1893
he was again c ected by the voters and was
duly dec ared Chief of Poice. The new char
ter of Sicramento went into operation in Jan
uary, 1894, and the office of Chief of Police
was made appointive instead of elective. The
Supreme Court opinion in part is as follows:
"The judgment is uot In form appropriate to
the siate of the case at the time of the trial,
the office having been abolished, but it cannot
be corrected on this appeal, which is ior an or
der denying a motion for a new trial only."
Tea at Belvedere.
The tea thai was to have been held at the
residence oi Mrs. J. S. Matoon, Belvedere, on
October 31. end which was postponed on ac
count of unfavorable weather, will take place
to-day, November 7.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7. 1896.
HEALTH BOARD
EMPLOYES OUT
Two Insp p ctors Removed
and Several Others
Appointed.
Advantage Taken of the Recent
Raise in the Appropria
tion
H: B3ARD COMMENDS ITSELF
Extraordinary Precantirm to Be
Taken Against the Spread of
Disease.
The Board of Health took occasion to
congratulate itseif on its administration
at a meeting held yesterday, and not only
to tell â  hat it had ilonp in the past, but
what it intended to do in the future.
B -fore eettin^ down to throwing bou
quets at itself the board took occasion to
make a number of changes among its em
ployes that hay been contemplated for
some time.
The position of Inspector A. T. Patton,
who declined to resign, was declared va
cant, and P. L. Long was apj>ointeii to the
vacancy.
The resignation of Inspector Q. W. Stout
was accepted, and A. P. Donovan was
chosen to fill the place. The new positions
of assistant food inspectors, recently cre
ate.i and provided for by the increased |
appropriation granted by the Board ol
Supervisors, were rilled by the followin â :
Harry o'Donnell, T. McEtov, J. Lahuney,
P. K' ssam, R. H. Lyons ;imi K. A by.
Each wi.l receive a salary i>f $75 a month.
A. T. Tayior and v. W. Davis were ap
pointed outside assi-tant food inspectors
at salaries of $75 a month each.
The annual report to M-.iyor Sutro, as
president of the board, was then read by
Secretary Godchaux. Af'er reviewing to
some extent the history of previous ad- j
ministrations, the effurts of the present j
body were taken ui> arid the why an-i the ;
wherefore of its success diluted on. Its !
success v! effort to procure an increase of
the $26,000 annual appropriation, with
which previous boards had been satisfied,
was described at length, and the fact that
it had succeeded in getting an appropria- !
tion of $65,01)0 proudly pointed out.
The tight a. ainst filth and unsanitary;
buildings in Cbinat wn was aso treated !
at some length and the great benefits de- I
rived irom the destruction of the old j
structures called to notice.
After showing the great advantage of
the fo d-inspection stations that are to be
established the report concludes:
"This warfare against disease will be
carried still further an l with more ag
gressiveness than before. The efforts iÂ»I
the board will include therecommenda- j
tipn of the adoption o an ordinance pro
hibiting, under penalty of arreat, the
habit of indiscriminate expectoration in
streets and other puolic piaces, as well as
other m- asures wich will tend to educate
the general puD.ic up to t c proper recog
nition of tuberculosis as a highly danger-
OHI and infectious disease, and suuiect to
the same regulations and restrictions as j
those diseases which are now classed ss 1
dangerous and infectious, but which, in i
comparison with tuberculois, deserve but a j
fraction of considera ion."
The contract for building a nw ambu
lance was awarded to O'Brien & Sons for
$650.

HOW MIKE TOUCHED
A BROTHER-IN-LAW
Deane Might Have Beaten
Broderick for City
Auditor.
Mournful and Impressive Lesson
Taught by a Faded Cam
paign Card.
BLIGHTED BY THE CHRONICLE.
That Journal's Friendship and Double
Dealing Cost a Popular Mun
a Good Position.
Swinging wearily in tbe wind, impaled
by a solitary tack that still held it in bond
age to a telephone-pole near the Chronicle
office, a posi-eiection campaign card was
to be seen at a late hour last night, bear
ing the inscription:
vote for :
WILLIAM A. DEANE
â¢ FOR AUDITOR. C
: Regular Republican and United :
; Labor Nominee. '.
That handbill, clinging like the last rose
of summer to its barren support, buffe ted
by the breezes that sweep over the Twin
Peaks and up Market street, drenched by
the nightly foes rolling in through the
Golden Gate and bleached by the glaring
sunshine of the day, that lonely, solitary
placard is a sad memento of the recent
municipal campaign.
Worn out, dilapidated, passe, steeped in
the gloom of innocuous desuetude, that
unconsidered scrap of pasteboard im
presses an important lesson upon the mind
of at least one unhappy journalist of San
Francisco. That disgruntled newspaper
proprietor is M. H. de Young, editorof the
Chronicle, and he is vigorously kicking
himself for having caused the defeat of his
brotuer-in-law. William A. Deane, who,
but lor Mr. deYoung's over-ruling propen
sity for double-dealing might to-day be
the Auditor-elect of the great City and
County of San Francisco.
It was a fatal error, allowing that snug
salary to escape f rom the family, and no
one realizes it more than does Mr. de
Young at the present moment. He
yearns in vaiu for another chance at the
game, but the stakes have been won and
Mr. Broderick, the successful competitor,
would be ungrateful to his friends ii he
would think of making a race a second
time, even if the Election Commissioners
should agree to pay the incidental ex
penses.
Billy Deane is one of the best known
and best liked of the young generation of
politicians of San Francisco. Everybody
likes him and over 23,000 citizens voted to
make him the City's Auditor, notwith
standing the fact that there were five can
didates in the field. This is really a re
markable vote, and no other candidate
receiving anything like that support has
suffered defeat. One candidate for the
Superior Court bench actually gains his
seat with a total of only 16,898 votes.
There is not an incident in Brother-in
law Deane's canvass on which Brother-in
law de Young en depend for consolation.
When Mr. Deane wa^ nominated by the
regular Republican Municipal Convention
the Chronicle came out with a scathing
article, declaring tlie entire ticket to be
composed of boiters and indorsing the
nominees put forward by Martin Kelly,
M. H. de Young and a handful of followers,
including Asa R. Wells tor Auditor.
Fora while The Call and other friends
of Mr. Deane hoped that the Chronicle
would give him a chance to win by re
fraining from tendering him its support.
But, alas, he was not destined to enjoy
any such luck. The Chronicle began, one
fatal day, to publish articles in his be alf,
and that seaied bis fate, though, dev,,ite
the Chronicle's efforts, he was defeated by
a very narrow margin.
.Lest Brother-in-law de Young has not
yet fuliy comprehended the situation, the
following statistical statement is luruished
for his perusal:
Broderick 's vote 24,251
Deane's voie 38,193
Broderi'jfs plurality 959
It is known that Mr. de Young's domi
nance of the Martin-Kelly convention was
so complete that lie could have secured
the indorsement of Mr. Deane if he had so
desired, or at least he could have put up a
man of straw who could have been
knocked down with a feather. Before his
sympathies for his brother-in-law were
aroused he ignored these conditions. At
last he decided to do his best to elect his
relative and induced Mr. Wells to with
draw. But the strode came too late. Mr.
Wells is a reputable citizen, though un
fortunately found in evil company for one
time at least. His withdrawal from the
race was published on the first page of the
Chronicle, and was given prominent men
tion by all the papers of the City, but his
popularity is so great that he received
nearly 2500 votes, since it was impossible
at that late date to take his name from the
blanket ticket.
Now, nere are a few more fipures for
Brother-in-law de Young. If De Young
had taken Mr. Wells out of the fight at an
earlier day it is fair to presume that
Brother-in-law Deane would have got the
Republican votes that were cast for Mr.
Wells, and the result would have stood
thus:
Broderick'g vote â 24 251
Deane's vote 23.292" '
Weiia' vote 2.490
Total Deane would have re
celved 25.782
Any schoolboy can tell Brother-in-law
de Young that this would have given
Brother-in-law Deane a lead of 1531
which mieht have been greatly aug*.

BURGLARY ON POWELL.
The House of Mrs. J. S. Slayer Entered.
Ladies Frightened.
A burglar entered the residence of Mrs.
J. S. Mayer, 606 a Powell street, near Bu9h,
some time during Thursday ni^ht. It is
thought he entered througli the front door
and passed through the hall into a front
room occupied by a young man wno lodges
in the house. Then he must have passed
through the south side of the bay-window
out onto a small veranda, and from there
entered the bay-window oi the front par
lor. He probably went back into the
back parlor, which is the sleeping apart
ment of the Misses Birdie and Tress
Miiyer.
There had been left on the bureau a
purse containing $5 75 and some rare
coins. All these were taken except the
purse, which was left behind with 1 cent
in it.
On the way in the burglar went through
the pock ts of the young lodger and se
cured $2 95.
It is believed that he must have been
scared off before he could do any more
damage. He went out by unlocking the
parlor door from the inside and passed
out through the hall.
The mere thouglitof a man having beer,
in their room has almost given the Misses
Mayer nervous prostration.

Grand Jury Found Two In

LANGUAGE OF THE LIBELS.
Circular Signei by Depositors of the
People's Home Bank Published
After Signers Were ladictel.
The Grand Jury went into Judge
Slack's court yesterday afternoon and
through the foreman, Frederick Hobbs, pre
sented two indictments for misdemeanor
libel against Fied Marriott, proprietor of
the San Francisco News Letter and Cali
fornia Advertiser. On motion of E. D.
Peixotto, Assistant District Attorney, a
bench warrant was issued lor Marriott's
arrest and bail fixed at $500 on each
charge.
The complaining witness in this case is
J. C. B. Heobard, Judge of the Superior
Court. He submitted to the Grand Jury,
through Mr. Peixotto, a copy of the San
Francisco News Letter of October 31, 1896.
The circular signed by T. H. McCarthy,
E. P. Kendall, Thomas S. Williams Jr.,
George B. Conant, Benjamin Lucy, A. L.
Casarair and T. H. Qualman, People's
Home Savings Bank depositors commit
tee, was published under the following
display lines in the News Letter of last
Saturday:
AN APPEAL TO VOTERS.
What the representatives of tbe swindled
depositors of tne People's Home Savings Bank
think of
JUDGE J. C. B. HEBBARD.
Substantial reasons why he should not be
re-elected Superior Court Judge of the City
and County ot San Francisco.
Shortly after the circular was first cir
culated as a campaign document, the
men who signed it were indicted for libel
by the present Grand Jury. One indict
ment agidnst Fred Marriott is for the pub
lication of the same document in the
News Letter.
The second indictment found yesterday
was tor publishing the following comment
011 the document first mentioned :
In another part
A WORTHY JUDGE, of tne News Let
ter appears an
FORSOOTH! article signed
, by a committee
of the People s Home Savings Bank depositors
showing adequHte cause why Judge Hebbard
should not De re-elected. The statements
made in this terrible document will cause
every honest man to shrink iron) voting for a
creature who is therein clearly proven to be
the enemy of numerous widows and orphans,
and morally liable for the loss of their little
savings. Is that the sort of man to re-elect
Judge? Not so. Intelligent men will learn
well the lesson that article teaches, and will
see to it taat he is removed from the high po
sition he disgraces. If tools are to be elected
to the judiciary, then honest men had better
get out of the City. But it will be more natu
ral lor us to relegate tne tools to the oblivion
they so richly merit.
The indictments set forth that the arti
cles published are malicious and defama
tory, tending to impeach the integrity
vinue an.i honesty of J. C. B. Hebbard, a
Judge of tbe Superior Court, an. 1 to ex
pose him to public hatred and contempt.
The members of the Grand Jury attend
ing the session at which the indictments
were found were Frederick Hobbs, Harry
Durbnw, C. C. Burr, George JoneÂ«, H. S.
Hogan, William L. Ashe. William F. Mau
Robert Haight. David B. Faktor. August

While Judge Hebbard was waiting in
the anteroom for members of the Grand
Jury to arrive he was greeted and con
gratulated on his success in the Hection by
many of his friends in the City HaiJ. Con
cerning tbe libel proceedings against the
News Letter he remarked that the indict
ment was not sought on his own account
but as a matter of public duty and im
portance. It is expected that the trial of
the case will reveal the names of persons or
corporations that expended money in con
siderable sums to print and circulate cam
paign documents designed to deieat Judge
Hebbard.

FINAL RALLY
Resolutions Adopted Declar
ing for a Renewal of
the Fight.
They Raise a Good Sum of Money
to Pay the Last Cam
paign Debt.
A EOAST FDR DE YOUNG-
The Metropolitan Temple Meeting
Was a Rouser in Numbers aid
Enthusiasm
The convention of the State Suffrage
Association concluded its business yester
day and adjourned, having furnished
during its entire session an example of
MISS MARY G. HAY.
piuck and patience such as should quiet
forever the calumny that women do not
know how to govern themselves â that
they become hysterical in face of defeat.
Just before adjournment the women of
the convention subscribed $1125 to pay off
a campaign debt of $900 and to begin a re
newal cf the fight for suffrage.
Not one note of real discouragement
was struck during the convention. The
meeting at Metropoiitar. flail called in
advance as a rejoicing over an anticipated
victory "was Dy no means a funeral," as
Miss Hay remarked. It was a strong
"last word" to a magnificently fought
campaign.
The proceedings of the convention yes
terday morning took the lorra of a gen
eral leave-taking of the women who have
stood and fought together for the past
eight months. In the afternoon the real
business of the session was transacted in
rapid shape. Officers were elected and the
committees on "plan of work" and ol
"resolutions" made their report, and at
the sol citation of Miss Mary G. Hay tbe
big sum of money was subscribed by
women who have for the past eight
months been daily paying out money in
their work.
Following are the officers elected:
President, Mrs. John F. Swift, San Fran
cisco; first vice-pr sident, Mrs. F. M.
Smith, Oakland; second vice-president,
Mrs. General John -Bidwell, Chico; third
vice- president, Mrs. Elmira T. Stevens,
Los Angeles; correspondinr secretary,
Mrs. Judge Cotton, San Francisco; re
cording secretary, Mrs. Nellie H. Blinn,
San Francisco; treasurer, Mr*. Mar? S.
Sperry, San Francisco; auiitorsâ Mrs.
Lovell White and Mrs. George Oulten,
San Francisco.
The State delegate to the National com
mittee was not chosen, but -vlllv l l l be at a
meeting of the ex cutive committee to be
held at Mrs. Sar.-ent's home tbis morning.
Mrs. A. A. Sargent and Mrs. Knox
Goodrich were by resolution made hon
orary presidents.
Mrs. Snerry, treasurer, made her report
throu h Mrs. Emma B. Sweat, whom
Mrs. Sperry credited with dome all the
real work connected with her office. She
reported that over $15,000 had bÂ»Â»en sub
scribed and expended during the cam
paign; that over a million woman suf-
Irage 1 afiets had been sent out.
Miss Anthony remarked that this was
the largest sum of money ever handled
in a State campaign in the cause of suf
lrage.
Following is the report 6f the commit
tee on resolutions read by Mrs. Ida
Harper, chairman of the press commit
tee, and whose appearance on the stnge
was greeted by applause:
Whereas, After an eight months' campaign
to secure suff age for the women of California,
supported by a large proportion of the press
and all the moral and educational forces i;i
the State, we find a majority of tho popuiar
vote against conferring this franchise; Hnd
whereus this campaign has revealed a deplor
able skepucisin in regurd to universal suffrage
and a decline of faith in American principles,
as shown by this refusal to fur ncr extend the
franchise; and whereas it has been unmis
takably demonstrated that the dominating
political parties of the State are controlled by
corrupt and vicious influences; therefore be it
Resolved, That we see in this defeat of woman
suffrage a menace to the S ate, a mnjority of
whose voters have declared in favor of con
tinuing present conditions and against ad
mitting to a i>hare In the government the only
element which can be depended upon to
change them for the better.
Jiesolved, Tnat fully recognizing and appreci
ating the services of nearly 300 newspapers in
the State which supported the sixth amend
ment, we Hereby exp ess the thanks of the
State Association and of all friends of suffrage,
aud we urge that their assistance be continued
until our victory is won.
Resolvtd, That this association cordially
ackuowledges the splendid work that has
been done by thousands of women in all parts
of the State to secure their political freedom,
nnd considers that any individual mention
would bean unfair discrimination. We t&ice
pleasure, however, in malting one exception
in favor of our retiring Slate president, Mr*.
Ellen C. Sargent, whose valuable time and ser
vices lor the past year have been wholly de
voted to the cause of woman suffrage, whose
house was used as headquarters for nine
mon!h3and whose home has been placed at
the service of our Eastern assistants during
the entire campaign.
Resolved, That no formula of words can ex
press the Kratttude and reverence we feel for
our honored National leader. Susan B. An
thony, who has given eight month* of 1 er
prectous life to ihe women of Caliiornia, with
out any financial re compense whatever, ren
dering the same unse fish devotion to the pres
ent campaign mat she has contributed to the
whole Nation for fifty years.
Resolved, That while we accept the verdict
of the election, we do not regard It as final,
but believing that ourcause is just and must
prevail, we will enter at once upo a vigorous
campaign which will end ouly when the bal
lot is placed in tbe bauds of California women.
Ida A. Harper, Rev. Elizabeth Tupper
Wiikes. Mary A Swift, Ida V. Stambach. Hat
tie E. Cotton, Ada H. Van Pelt, committee.
A vote of thanks at the su gestion of
Mrs. McCann was given by the conven
tion to the men who voted for the enfran
chis ment of women.
Following is the report of the committee
on plan of work to be undertaken at once
and continued:
1. Work for constitutional amendment at
the next Legislature, piaiia to be hereafter de
veloped.
2. Thorough county organization, consisting
of a county central committee to be com: osed
of an election board and the chairman of
each precinct.
3. The Importance of organization in every
precinct.
4. The home department for precinct work,
consisting of a system of calls, loaning and
distributing literature, extending invitations
to meetings.
5. Interest tbe young people in a series of
entertainments, dramas, contests, socials, teas,
eampaizn songs.

11. The presentation of work before other or

MISS HAY SURPRISED.
She Received a Handsome Testi
monial Slcrned by Governor Budd.
Governor Budd headed a list of signers
to an engrossed testimonial which was
presented last evening to Miss Mary G.
Hay, National organizer and president ot
the Woman Suffrage Btate Central Com
mittee. The presentation took place at
the headquarters of the committee in the
Parrott building. A. T. Hatch. W. H.
Chapman, Dr. N. T. Bird and Guy A. R.
Lewington were the delegation which had
charge of the affair. The testimonial was
worded as follows:
To Mary Q. Hay. As me*n of the Pacific Coest
we bear witness and must acknowledge that
the campaign fought (or woman's suffrage has
been one oi the cleanest and one of the best
organized and munaged that has occurred in
our midst since California came into the Union.
The highest degree of credit for this result is
due to Mary G. Hay, National organizer and
chairman of the Woman suffrage State Central
Committee, who has shown unusual executive
ability and tact. Her organising power, clear
head and gentle firmness have won forfther
what we all covet. It has proved to us that
women in politics, as elsewhere, areourequal*
ana able co-helpers.
Tberetore we have determined to sign our
names to this, our sincere opinion, that Mary
G. H iy may know in what respect and esteem
we hold her.' The other brilliant and capable
women whom we have been pleased to honor
and to welcome to our Slate and to our politi
cal Dlntfornis, under the leadership of that
grand and steadfast woman, Susan B. An
tnony. know what our opinion of them is.
Miss Ha has taken the quieter part, the busi
ness part, the executive part, the organizing
part, and this we all know is one of the most
'Mfficult of all ; and tor this reason we wish to
express to her personally our most sincere
congratulations and keen appreciation of her
exceptional bil'.y, from first to last, in the
carnpalgo of 1896 lor woman suffrage in the
State of California.
A- T - ttatch presented the testimonial
with a neat presentation speccti. The
other members of the delegation also
made briei remarks, also adding Reserved
words of praise for the work Miss Hay has
faithfully performed.
Miss Hay Â»p. ke briefly in acknowledg
ment. She said that she did not think
that she deserved the mark of favor which
had been given to her, but she could ap
preciate it, coming as it did from gentle
men who know something of business and
of political work. She would be glad to
show the gift to her people and to say that
i here were 80.000 good strong men in Cali
fornia. She appreciated the gift more
than *he could ever express in words and
more than those present could possibly
Hnderstand.
Miss Hay hag been the executive officer
of the woman suffrage campaign, to whom
all the workers looked for direction. She
ha? worked several months in this State
for woman suffrage.
DE YOUNG ROASTED.
A Rousing: Meeting: at Metropolitan
Hallâ Rtnglnsr Speeches.
The meeting at Metropolitan Temple
was a "rouser," filling all the seating and
standing space under the big roof. As
Miss Hay said, it "did not look like a lost
cause."
Miss Anthony presided and had the
audience with her all the time.
The officers of the convention of the
afternoon read the resolutions and told of
the work of the campaign, the resolutions
read by Mrs. Harper being warmly ap
plauded.
Judge Maguire was introduced by Mias
Anthony and was greeted as a friend. He
said tliat among the best speeches he had
henrd during ihe campaign were made by
women wnile advocating tbeir cause. He
said he had been embarrassed during his
own canvass. For himseli he stood for
woman suffrage not as such but as favor
ing a part of universal suffrage for which
he stood. His embarrassment had arisen
from the fact that bis own party in con
vention had refused to indorse woman
suffrage in its platform, and speaking
under the auspices of that party it would
have been unseemly in him t<? speak his
views upon the subject of suffrage.
He hoped that at the next convention
of his party tbe plank for suffrage would
be favored by a large majority. So far
from the right being finished he declared
it was m lull rloon, and would not finish
until women voted with men.
Rev. Dr. McLean of Oakland was intro
duced r- a relat.ve-in-law of Miss An
thony â her eldest sister had married his
eldest brother.
"And my eldest brother got a very ex
cellent wife," said Mr. McLean. "And.
further, some man has missed the best
wife that God could have furnished him
in that Susan B. Anthony remains un
mnrr.cd. [Great applause.]
Dr. McLean made a strong littie talk,
followed by Miss Hay, whose likeness to
Mi.Â«s Shaw keep things a little confused
in the woman's suffrage camp.
Mrs. Catherine Chuprnan-Catt made an
eloquent talk. She htÂ«d hoped, she said,
that their great leader would be able to
walk with them into tbe promised land,
but now she did not know. Certainly this
woman, she said, had been divinely gifted
for this special mission, and her place was
already secure among the immortals.
"But there is a newspaper of this City,
a 'great' newspaper, and an owner of that
newspaper wi.ose name will be held in
loathing and contempt by men and women
who look for honesty and right in hich
places. So long as the name of S san B.
Anthony is revered the names of these
others will be despised." [Applause.]
Rev. Anna bhaw was the last speaker
and her effort was one of the most elo
quent of her series of addresses.
She told her hearers that suffrage was as
certain as the incoming tide, the cause
and the efforts of those engaged in it as
resistless as the sea. In conclusion she
simply said, "Good-by."
M M Anthony bade farewell on behalf
of herself and the other six Eastern
women who came out for the campaign.
WELCH CHANGES FRAUD.
He Saya Hfa Defeat Mas Accomplished
by Foul MÂ«Â«ni,
M. J. Welch, the Republican candidate
or Siate Senator i n the Twenty-third
District, will contest the election of Syd
ney Hall, the Democratic candidate, who
claims to Ikivj been elected.
Welch wiil not only contest but declares
an intention of bringing suits for illegal
voting or recister-stuffing that he says
will certainly land some individuals in
San Quentin, tliere to keep company with
one Louis Steinberg of Manoney- Baldwin
Hotel unsavory memory.
The unofficial returns show that Sydney
Hall received 1667 votes, J. G. Tyrrell 1659
and M. J. Welch 1632.
A little figuring will show that Hall re
ceived 35 votes more than Welch and
Tyrrell 27.
Mr. Welch will call for a recount imme
diately upon the Election Commission
declaring the result officially.
Welch claims to have positive evidence
of fraud directed against himself and
which was sufficient tv place the narrow
margin over in the columns of his oppo
nents, to his defeat.
He refuses, however, to go into particu
.lars at tne present in the fear, he says,
that those whom he hopes to convict and
remove from the possibility of doing any
further politics of their peculiar kind will
fly to Canada. He promises, however, that
there will be sensational developments be
fore long.
Warrants may be sworn out to-day for
the arrest of certain individuals of con
siderable prominence in political circles.
Welcome to Dr. Hemphlll.
A welcome home will be tendered the Rev.
Mr. Hemphill, pastor of Calvary Church, ana
Mrs. Hemphill Tuesday evening In the church
parlors. The members of Calvary Church had
arranged to give the reception last evening,
but owing to an unavoidable delay Dr. Hemp
hill was unable to reach the City until too
late an hour for the reception. The arrange
ments for the welcome home are in charge of
an executive committee, of which D. W. Hors
burgh in chnirman, and indications point to a
very large attendance of the members of the
church. The parlors will be beautifully deco
rnted by a committee under the direction of
Mrs. A. K. Baldwin, ana au interesting pro
gramme has been prepared.
Faro Game Raided.
Captain Al White's faro game, 13 Third
street, was raided by Sergeants Davis, Dono
van and a squad of policemen at 12:30 o'clock
this morning. The dealer, lookout and six
players were arrested and booked at the South
ern Police station, but were subsequently re
leased on bail. A complete faro layout was
secured and will be used as evidence against

BARNETT PUNCHED
J. J. RAUER'S EVE
A Lively Affray in the
County Clerk's Office
Yesterday.
The Collector Charged With
Working Against William
A. Deane.
FIGHT AFTER LIE WAS PASSED
The Journal of Commerce Man Was
Belligerent and Scored a Point
in the Bcut.
The clerks and visitors in the County
Clerk's office were treated to a lively setto
yesterday, in which J. J. Raver, the col
lector, and Moses Barnett of the Journal
of Commerce were the principals. It was
one of the very few interesting fights re
sulting from the election and the audience
enjoyed it greatly.
Barnett, who was interested to some ex
tent in the canvass of W. A. Deane for
the office of Auditor, has been making
statements that Ruuer put up $600 to keep
Mr. Chapman, the independent candidate
for Auditor, in the fi Id, for the express
purpose of defeating Deane. These tales
came to the ears of the collector, and
when he met Burnett yesterday he de
manded to know the truth of the matter.
"Ye?, I did say that you were trying to
beat Deane," answered Barnett, "and
moreover I can prove it. You were stand
ing in with another candidate to beat him,
and you know it."
Raver looked him in the eye for an in
stant and thpn said slowly:
"You are a liar, sir."
Barnett aid not delay about beginning
hostilities, but swung his right on Raver's
eye and was preparing for another blow
when the ponly and thoroughly enraged
collector closed on nim and a rougn-ahd
tumble contest, without regard to the
rules of he ring, ensued.
Both clawed and punched desperately
and by the time they were separated by
clerks were exhausted ami somewhat the
worse for wear. Barnett had several
scratches about the forehead and Raver m
somewhat contused eye.
Alter tne rigtu Barnett reiterated his
8 Â»tem>nt that Raver had worked and
iij-ed money in the Auditor fight and that
Chapman had told him so in the presence
of his brother-in-law.
"I went to Chapman and told him that
he could not win and had better get out
of the fight," he said, "and in answer he
told me that he would lose, but that Raver
was putting up the money in the interest
of another candidate and that he was go
ing to stay in anyway. He tackled me
about it and I nnnched him, that's all"
Mr. Raver was somewhat ruffled over
the incident, but indignantly denied that
he had put up $600, or any other sum to
defeat D ane. '
"This man went into a losing fight and
was sore over it," he said, "and spread
these lies about to make trouble. There
is nothing in it."
