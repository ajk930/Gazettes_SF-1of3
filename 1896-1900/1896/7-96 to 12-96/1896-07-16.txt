CAPTAIN CLASS BLAMED FOR
THE DISASTER.
Kept the Vessel Moving at Thirteen
Knots an Hoar in the
Fog.
PEBCADERO, Cal., July 15.â The Pa
cific Mail steamship Colombia is thump
ing the life out of herself and her master
is walking her trembling deck trying to
explain why he ran his ship thirteen
knots an hour in a fog almost as dense as
milk. But whatever reason Captain Clark
may give for plunging ahead at high speed
through a vapor-hidden sea, the Colombia
wallows heavily on the rocks a few hun
dred yards to the southward of Pigeon
Point. The reef is gnawing great holes in
her good steel hulk, and to and fro down
in the forehold the waves rise and fall.
She struck first on the port bow and the
jaggea rocks rent her cruelly there; then
tbe wounded craft, pushed ahead by a
13-knot force, went farther on to the sharp
points, and the ground swell, with its lift
ing and sinking, is completing her un
doing. Every time she lets down on the
cluster of rocks the shattered plates in her
bottom bend and break. She groans as
she rolls in ber bed and the grinding of
the reef that is destroying her resounds
weird and uncanny through her compart
ments.
This was a beautiful, calm, sunny day
and the doomed Colombia appeared to

rest safely on a quiet sea. She went ashore
at low water and berforehold. with fifteen
Dr eighteen feet of water in it, holds her
how down on the rocks when the rising
tide elevates her stern. Still the bow lifts
somewhat on the swell â just enough to let
ihe forward part of the steamer's hull
pound the plates out of her, and the
strokes can be heard ashore through the
nuiet air.
Wden the Colombia struck she was
headed northward, directly for San Fran
cisco. Captain Clark was hurrying. He
bad been speeding up the coast from Aca
pulco, his last port, and was trying to
make a record with the new Pacific Mail
tieamer that came out to take the lost
Colima's place. He was already two days
ahead of time and was still doing well, so
he was hugging the points of land and no
seagrass was growing under his keel â
bence the thirteen knots an hour in a
dense fog.
Within 200 yards of a field of hay, cut
and in stacks, lies this courser of the seas,
vow helpless on the shore. Spectators
from ail the country around dotted the
shore to-day and watched her roll and
?nnd. Some brought their lunch-baskets
md made a picnic of a disaster. The
Colombia pitches but little, as her bow is
bard on the rocks, but every time a swell
jtriKes her she comes down aft with a
:orce that momentarily threatens not
only to stave her in but to break her in
two. Sometimes she rolls over at an angle
)f 45 degrees, and comes back onto the
rocks with a force and suddennes that
threatens to snap her spars. That- was a
langer momentarily threatened this fore
noon. Captain Clark stood on the star
board side of the forward deck this morn
ing when she turned over further than
usual and came back with a thud and a
crash.
"That's a hard one," he said curtly, "and
.hey're getting bigger. She won't last
long if they get much worse."
The Colombia lies in a little bay, with
ihe Pigeon Point lighthouse high above
aer on a point about a quarter of a mile to
ihe north. When there is a blow outside
ihe waves house-high chase each other
.nto this bay. If a storm should come up
jutside the Colombia would be tossed up
md down on the rocks so that there
ivould not be enough left of her in twelve
aours for use as scrapiron. This is what
,he ship's officers are afraid of. Even if
Ihe weather continues calm, which it is
tiuiy to do at this ume of year, the officers
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
do not believe the Colombia can be saved.
They try to pat a cheerful face on the
situation, but it is an effort to do so.
When asked separately by a Call repre
sentative whether it would be possible to
save the vessel three of the ship's officers
said "I do not think so." Another said,
laconically, "You tell us how."
When asked this morning how he felt
Captain Clark replied, "Well, I'm still on
decK," and then the captain caught hold
of a rope to steady himself as the ship
lurched toward the land.
Every swell that strikes the Colombia
works her further in shore, inch by inch
and foot by foot. By this time to-mor
row, if the present rate of progress keeps
up, it will be possible to pitch hay down
on to her decks from the fields above. To
such ienoble possibility may a noble ship
come in her great helplessness.
Up to noon to-day there was water in
only one compartment forward. There is
no water aft, though the rocks are ex
pected almost with each roll to punch a
hole into her and let in the sea. The fires
under her boilers were out this morning.
The reason for this was stated by one of
the engineers to be to save coal. Most of
the ship's coal is in the forward compart
ment, and the bulkhead next to it is full
of rolling water and floating and pitching
cargo. It could be plainly seen through
the open hatch. During a half-hour this
morning the water in this compartment
raised two feet, until it was flush with the
deck, and broken boxes and packages of
merchandise were almost thrown over the
sides of tbe hatch as back and forth she
rocked.
Captain Clark said this afternoon if the
weather was favorable he intended to drop
his anchors and try to work the Colom
bia's stern around so that she would float
with only her prow on the sand and rocks.
The tug Vigilant is lying about a half mile
out to sea for this purpose or any other
service she may be able to render the
stranded ship. Tbe tug Reliance lay out
to sea all forenoon, but left at 12 o'clock for
San Francisco with Mrs. Strand, the stew
ardess of the Colombia, several attaches of
the ship an.l other passengers. Mrs. Strand
waved a sad farewell to her shipmates as
she left for the tag in one of the ship's
boats.
Captain Metcalf, an underwriter's agent,
took charge of the stranded steamer.
The ColomDia's crew, the from captain
down, will remain with her until ordered
!to leave. All the boats are tied alongside,
and during the night a big, white lifeboat
from the life-saving station at Fort Point
came down and dropped anchor between

the ship and the shore. This it could eas
ily do, as the Colombia rolls in less than
four fathoms of water. The figures on her
bow show twenty-three feet, while her
stern is comparatively higti up. As the
ship lies at present there is no danger to
the lives of those aboard, but if a blow
should come up and the swells run high
the ship's boats would be very necessary.
Work aboard the Colombia to-day indi
cates her abandonment, as much, if not
more, than it does anything else. She is
being diligently liehtered of her cargo,
and everything aboard is being racked up,

CHAIRMAN TATJBENECK7S NEW
SCHEME.
Sergeant-at-Arms McDrwell's Impor
tant Visit to the Arkansas
Convention.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 15.â J. H.
McDowell, sergeant-at-arms of the Popu
list National Committee, arrived hereto
day from St. Louis and immediately went
before the State Populist Convention with
a proposition which he said was written
by Chairman Taubeneck and would be
submitted to thÂ« National Convention at
St. Louis next week. It is as follows:
Tne all-absorbing question now agitating
the political world is what the People's party
and the Silver party will do at their respective
conventions to be held in St. Louis July 22. In
order to restore silver to its lawful place and
make a combination with Democrats they
mv.st do one of two things:
Firstâ lndorse the Democratic ticket nom
inated at Chicago and merge into the Demo
cratic party; or
Second â Nominate a ticket of their own and
enter into an agreement with the Democrats
on one set of electors. If the first policy is
pursued the People's party will lose its iden
tity, and for the following reasons become an
annex to the Democratic party:
Firstâ Whenever one party indorses the Na
tional ticket of another it has no further ex
cuse to exist.
Secondâ All the State, Congressional, legis
lative and county candidates in the People's
party, with the exception of a few Western
States, will have to resign, because it will be
impossible for the Populist candidates to make
a tight for their local tickets when the party
nationally indorses the Chicago nominees.
Thirdâ The Populist and Silver parties will
lose tbeir organisations, and will go to pieces
after the November election and become a part
of the Democratic machine.
Fourthâ The Populist press, which ia a
powerful factor with an organisation behind
it, would disappear and be displaced by a
Democratic press and the Populist editors
turned down.
Fifth â Should the Populist party indorse the
Democratic nominees and the ticket be suc
cessful at the polls next November the Pop
ulists would not be in a position to demand
anything except what a Democratic adminis
tration might dole out to them.
Sixthâ lf the Populist and Silver parties
merge into the Democratic party the Demo
cratic administration will carry out the Demo-
cratic platform as regards paper money re
deemable in coin and no more, while all
other reforms demanded by the Populists will
have to wait until another new party forces an
old one to take them up, as the People's party
has now forced the Democratic party to take
up the money question.
Seventhâ lf the Populist convention in
dorses Mr. Bryan it cannot deliver more than
60 per cent of the People's party voters to
the Democratic candidate. The disaffection
caused by such a course would keep a large
number of Populists who are bitterly opposed
I to surrendering the People's party at home on
] election day. This loss alone would be suf
ficient to elect McKinley electors in Kansas,
; MlMOUri, Nebraska and many other States.
On the other hand, suppose the Populist and
Silver parties consolidate and pursue the pol
icy of nominating a ticket of their own and
unite with the Democrats on electors, what I
will then be their status before the country ?
In the place of an annex to the Democratic
party they will become an ally, lor the follow
ing reasons:
Firstâ lt will preserve the People's party
organization for future use, and by making an
alliance with the bolting Republicans the
Populists will outnumber the Democrats and
make them the third party at the polls next
November.
Thirdâ lf the combination ticket is success
fnl the Populists will have either the Presi
dent or Vice-President and will also be in a
position to demand an equal share ol the Fed
eral patronage, including the Cabinet and
foreign appointments.
Thirdâ Every Democratic newspaper, espe
cially the daily press, will be compelled to
trot the Populists on equal terms with the
Democrats. This will give the Populists a
daily press in the South and West.
Fourthâ The Populist party has the best lit
erature on the silver and money questions,
which will be in great demand, and the Demo
crats wili have to help circulate it.
Filthâ ln the South the Democrats will be
compelled to give the Populists a lair count
and a representation at, the polls, because if
an alliance is made between the two parties
ballot stuffing and counting out would not go.
Sixthâ lt will preserve the Populist press and
make it much more powerful than at the pres
ent time. This alone ought to appeal to every
Populist proper in the land to oppose the idea
of becoming an annex in the place of an ally.
Seventhâ When that portion of the Popu
list platform upon which Democrats agree is
enacted into law the Populists can continue
to educate the people o'i the other demands of
j the platform.
These are the two roads which confront the
People's and Silver parties at the National
Convention. Do these two parties possess
statesmanship and generalship enough to take
advantage of the situation and become an ally
in the place of an annex? Will they preserve
party identity and prove to the world that
they are able to cope with the most astute pol
iticians of this generation, or will they sur
render their principles and organization at
the behest of an opponent which has never let
an opportunity escape to stab them to death?

BOWLING GREEN, Ky., July 15.â Vice-
President Stevenson and wife arrived in

vention, but as to the outlook I am not
well enough posted to give an opinion."

The greatest obstacle in the way of the
Silver Democrats obtaining control of tbe
Populist convention is the unprecedented
size of that body, there beinp 1341 dele
gates. If Indian Territory, Oklahoma and
Alaska are admitted to the convention, as
they probably will, the vote will be nearly
1400. The respective States and Territories
are entitled to as many alternates as dele
gates, and as every one is expected to
send nearly a full quota of each, it is ex
pected that fully 2500 people will sit in
the Populist convention. It will be the
largest political convention in the history
jof American politics. Among the dele-
I gates will be several hundred women
! elected to represent the party in the locali
| ties in which they reside.
The apportionment of delegates to the
several States makes a very interesting
study. In the conventions of the Repub
lican and Democratic parties, New York,
'or instance, had 72 votes and California
I^. in the Populist convention California
will have 39 and New York 44. North
Carolina and Texas have 95 delegates
each, the largest allotment in the list.
Kansas conies next with 92, then Ten
nessee with 77, Georgia with 61, Alabama
and Illinois with 54 each, Minnesota and
Virginia with 53 each, Nebraska with 51,
Ohio with 49, Colorado with 45, New York
witk 44, Pennsylvania with 42, California
with 39, Missouri with 38, lowa and In
diana with 30, Michigan with 29, Ken
tucky and Wisconsin 25, Massachusetts 21,
Arkansas 20, Oregon, Washington and
South Carolina 17, Louisiana and Missis
sippi 15, North Dakota and New Jersey
12, Montana 11, Maine, Oklahoma and
Maryland 9, Florida and West Virginia 8,
Connecticut, Idaho and Wyoming and
Nevada 7, Utah 5, New Hampshire, Rhode
Island, Vermont, District of Columbia,
New Mexico and Arizona 4 and Dela
ware 3.
The basis of representation la one dele
pate for each United States Senator and
one for each Representative. The remain
der of the delegation of each State will bo
based on the State vote for the Populist's
Presidential candidate four years ago.
It will be seen from the foregoing appor
tionment that the coming People's party
will not represent population, but Popu
lists four years ago being represented in
this convention by the largest number of
delegates. Thus it will De a body fairly
representative of the Populistic senti
ments of this country and if I am not mis
taken it will be a very unwieldy one for
the silver Democracy to mold to its own
ends.
The reversal of the order of importance
in the several States, the last being put
first and the first last, is a unique feature
of this convention. Thus Nebraska will
have seven votes more than densely popu
lated New York, while California, with a
population not much larger than that of
the city of New York, will have only five
votes less than New York State. Hence
the vote in the convention will be indica
tive not of the predominence of a State,
but of the predominance of the Populist
party in that particular State.
Another unique feature will be several
hundred women delegates, who, it is pre
sumed, will insist on having the last word
on every question. For this reason it is
expected that the proceedings and the
debates will be characterized by that
courtesy and gallantry which ia the good
old days before th*Â» war was so conspicu
ous and such an agreeable feature of Dem
ocratic gatherings south of Mason and
Dixon's line. It is to be expected also
that when these new delegates arrive here
they will not be reticent as their male
brothers, for the Populist woman, bless
her, has a mind of ber own and is brave
enough notoniv to speak it, but to shout it.
The "middle-of-the-road" Pops are be
coming alarmed and indignant over the
attempts of the silver faction of the Dem
ocracy to absorb the People's party by
capturing its convention and are about to
open straight Populistic headquarters and
fling out the banner of their principles de
fiantly to the breeze.
Dr. D. Shattinger of South St. Louis has
engaged a large store next to the main en
trance of the Laclede Hotel for the straight
away, non-fusion, non-union, uncom
promising Populists. The doctor repre
sents the People's party Central Commit
tee and the People's party propaganda of
this city. The straight-away Populist has
the mettle and he is coming in large num
bers from all the contiguous States to see
that his side of the question shall have
fair play. Four hundred of him will come
Irom old Kentucky and will occupy rooms
at the Holland Houbc Other Southerners
will make the St. James the headquarters
for the straight middle-of-the-road Peo
ple's party of their section of t.;e country.
They are all in training for a fight and
will give the silver Democracy the great
battle of its life.
The straight-away Populists are very
| much cheered Dy the news of the dafeo>2
tions from the ranks of the Bryan anarch
istic Democrats. Every issue of the daily
newspapers is filled with announcements
of old-time influential Democratic leaders
and newspapers getting from under the
anarchistic platform and .taking shelter
under the safe and (conservative platform
of the Republican party or joining forces
with that radical element of politics
known as Populism. On the other hand,
the Bryan Democrats are stricken with
dismay. Their only hope, their last
ditch, is t:je capture of the People's party
convention. When that fails, as I am
certain that it will, they will see* some
secluded spot, give a few spasmodic kicks,
utter a few groans and quietly curl up and
die.
A severe blow was given to tne St. Louis
Democracy last nieht at the meeting of the
Jefferson Club, the strongest Democratic
organization of tne State. The club had
adopted a resolution indorsing Bryan and
Sewail, when Kolla Wells, its president,
who is oue of its most esteemed and in
fluential members, announced that as a
consistent Democrat be could not suppbrt
the Chicago ticket, and that he would
therefore resign his office and sever his
connection with the club. When be picked
up his hat and walked out of the door the
sensation became so chilly that the dele
gates ceased to perspire.
Hon. B. B. Cahooa of Fredericktown,
Mo., a Republican candidate for Gov
ernor, is pouring hot shot into the ranks
of the Altgeld-Tillman-Bryan democracy.
He said to me last night:
"The small farmer and the capitalist
alike are alarmed at the ascendency of the
Aitgelds and the Tillmans in the Deroo
<ratic party, for they realize that that
nieans a war on the man whose industry
has honestly accumulated $1000, by lazy
vagabonds, who have never accumulated
anything. The people of this country will
stamp out men like Bryan, men who seek
to make more discontented those who have
nothing by arraying them against the in
dustrious and saving classess. Let us
have a bchool-district campaign and we
will redeem Missouri in spite of the fusion
of the Democrats and Populists, winning
the State on the issue of its business devel
opment, and we will bold it permanently
hereafter."
The principal topic of conversation here,
on the streets and in the Merchants' Ex
change is the repudiation by the honest
Democracy of the Bryan-Sewall ticket.
Defections are noted all around and the
same thing seems to be prevalent in other
States.
Even at the seat of government, the
Democracy is breaking away from the
Chicago platform. Assistant Secretary
Harnlin of the Treasury is reported as
saying that the perpetuity of republican
institutions is threatened and that every
loyal citizen, irrespective of party, should
ally himself aeainst the forces that control
the Chicago convention, force of lawless
ness which are inconsistent with the main
tainence of the republic. Secretary Her
bert has also announced that he will not
support the ticket.
General John.Gill of Maryland, who was
a delegate to the Chicago convention, said
that the best way to stem the free silver
tide and to preserve the credit of the
country, was for a!l sound money Demo
crats to vote for McKinley.
Captain George If. Jackson, a Populist
delegate from Arkansas, says that every
tenth of the platform on which Mr. Bryan
stands is in opposition to the principles of
the Populist idea. He is opposed to and
will right against the indorsement of
Bryan and in favor of the nomination of
Senator Teller, of Colorado, or Judge
Caldwell of Little Rock, Ark., for Presi
dent. *
The most prominent Populist delegate
on the ground is ex-Governor John Price
Buchanan of Tennessee. Mr. Buchanan
is a representative of that manly type of
the Southern gentleman whose presence
is as grateful to the senses as the perfume
of the magnolia blossoms thatprow around
his piazza in his beloved Southern home.
His face is that of one who has lived well
and at peace with his neighbors. He is a
representative People's party man and his
lineage is American of the bluest of the
blue. His ancestors were for generations
past native Tennesseeans.
The Governor spent his boyhood days
on a farm three miles from Franklin. At
the breaking out of the Civil War young
Buchanan, inspired by love of his home,
and burning with loyalty for all that was
near and dear, to him, enlisted as a pri
vate in the Confederate army at the age of
16 years and served with gallantry during
the last year of the war in General For
rest's famous cavalry. After the close of
the war he returned home and went to
f-chool. At the age of twenty he married
his sweetheart and with true Southern
pluck went to farming in wheat, corn and
cotton on rented land in the effort to
build himself a home.
As a poor man at the very foot of the
ladder he began the struggle of lite. But
his loyalty to home, his industrious
habits, his sterling manhood and Ins
ability were recognized spontaneously by
his neighbors without any seeking on his
part, and thus without "hi 3 solicitation
and in the face of his positive declination
tbey elected him a mercLisr of the Legis
lature of 18S7 and 1889, He gave so much
satisfaction that in 1890 they elected him
Governor of the great State "of Tennessee.
When Cleveland was nominated for the
Presidency toward the close of Governor
Buchanan's term, the Governor, through
patriotic and conscientious motives, as
many of the best Democrats then and
since have done, refused to advocate Mr.
Cleveland's election. Governor Buchanan
was therefore obliged to undergo ostra
cism by the machine of the Democratic
party and to run for the governorship as
an independent Southern gentleman.
Through the power of the machine he
was defeated, and no doubt realizing that
the Democracy, once the party of Jeffer
son and Jackson, had become a Hessian
of whatever wind that blew, joined the
Populists, because lie saw in the platform
of that organization the principles which
were in accord with his honest convic
tions.
Governor Buchanan told me these thines
to-night only after considerable solicita
tion on my part, lie has the modest} of
the true gentleman, and I had to wrestle
with him as Jacob did with the angel, al
though I am not of the tribe of Jacob, and
although the Governor (and I ask his
pardon publicly for saying it) is not of the
tribe of the angel.
Governor Buchanan believes that the
financial issue is the great one before the
people in this campaign, but declined to
say whether he was or was not in favor of
the indorsement of Populist Bryan and
Capitalist Sewall.
rutting two and two together and com
puting that they make four (which is a
Hani task in this muggy weather), I should
say, taking the fact into consideration
tbat Governor Buchanan did not love
Grover Cleveland, and that Grover Cleve
land did not love him, that Governor
Buchanan may be suspected of a silver
lining. I hope tbat I am mistaken, be
cause I liKe the Governor, but I can sin
cerely say that on whatever side of the
controversy the Governor opens his lips,
be will be sincere.
With Governor Buchanan is one of his
intimate friends, C. C. Henderson of Mur
freesboro. Term. He withdrew from the
corrupt Democracy at the same time that
Governor Buchanan did, and I have a
hunch from my familiar spirit that he is
of the same opinion as to the question of
fusion. John Paul Cosgeave.

There will be a fight in the Populist
National Convention over the proposed
indorsement of William J. Bryan for Pres
ident of the United States. It may be
long and bitter â it may be short and de
cisive. Already the combatants on both
sides are here in large numbers. They are
active, aggressive and uncompromising.
The middle-of-the-road boys will not give
up the struggle until they have been com
pletely vanquished. They want no quar
ter and will give none. They are righting
for the life of their party and against the
indorsement of a Democrat for any fed
eral office, great or small. This wing of
the party is encouraged in its efforts to
down Bryan in the convention by Chair
man Taubeneck and the other officers of
the National Committee. Taubeneck
draws a salary of $4000 a year and the
other officers of the party are paid in pro
portion.
Despite their efforts the Bryan boom is
growing. His shouters are arriving here
by every train, and when the leading
silver advocates of the country get on the
ground they will greatly swell the Bryan
procession. The Populists that are fight
ing the Nebraskan are fearful that he
should suddenly wave into town during
a session of the convention and stampede
it by one of his whirlwind speeches. They
feel that they could not resist the pres
sure of his eloquence and are praying that
nis footsteps may be directed elsewhere.
The fact is they live in daily fear of Bryan.
They realize that his indorsement means
the annihilation of their party.
Telecrarus have been pouring into head
quarters to-day from Nebraska, Kansas,
Colorado, South Dakota, Arkansas and
some of the Southern States, all declaring
for Bryan.
Interest in the corring convention is in
creasing daily, and by the end of the week
it will be at fever heat. It promises to be
the most important gathering of National
Populists in the history of the party. It
means a perpetuation of life or eternal
death. Missouri has divided on the main
question. One wing is for indorsing Bryan
and Sewall, while another wing will sup
port the proposition to namÂ« a straight
ticket and adopt a platform.
Ei-Governor Walte of Colorado, who
will head the delegation from that Btate,
is out for indorsing Bryan and Sewall,
and will begin work for it as soon as he
reaches St. Louis. He is backed by the
delegation from Colorado, which puts a
damper on the plan of the anti-Bryan
wing to put forward Senator Teller as a
Presidential candidate.
The advance guard of the Tennessee
delegation, which came in la3t night, has
a full-fledged Vice-Presidential baom for
W. H. Minims of that State. Ex-Governor
Buchanan, who has charge of the Mimms
boom, does not like Sewall, but is not
strongly opposed to Bryan. If it could be
so arranged that the Democratic Presi
dential nominee could be given first place
and Mimms second the Tennessee crowd
would be satisfied. Other wise, the Ten
nessee delegates, together with those from
other Southern States, will join the
middle-of-the-road faction and attempt to
swing the convention into line for an in
dependent party ticket. While Governor
Buchanan declines to state his position as
to indorsing Bryan, it is evident from his
talk that he favors such a course on the
part of the Populists.
"Bryan is a fine man," he said this
morning, "and the only way to secure free
silver is by a union of forces. The Demo
cratic platform and ticket is a vindication
of the men who bolted the Chicago con
vention four years ago."
"It is said, Governor, that the Southern
Populists will not accept Bryan %s their
candidate, because they do not want to
return to the Democratic party. How
about that?"
"They would not be returning to the
Democratic party," answered the rennes
seean. "The party would be returning to
them. True Populism is pure Democ
racyâJeffersonian Democracyâ and the
origin of the People's party was the de
parture from pure Democracy by the
Democratic party when it allowed Cleve
land and the Eastern contingent to take
the helm. In adopting the Populist plat
form and nominating a man like Bryan
the Democrats have returned to the prin
ciples of pure Democracy."
The biggest fight next to the one indors
ing the candidates will be that over the
platform. A very strong wing of the party,
beaded by Chairman Taubenbeck, Ser
geant-at-Arms McDowell, Chairman Roz
zelle of the Missouri State Committee and
many members of the National Committee,
proposes to make a fight for the adoption
of the Omaha platform instead of an in
dorsement of the Chicago declaration.
"I do not know what course may be
taken by the National Committee," said
the chairman. "It will hold its first session
the day before the convention meets, ana
while I have no doubt the individual
members will work for what they consider
the wisest and safest course for the party
to pursue there will be no attempt to
dictate to the convention as a body what it
shall do."
Notwithstanding this statement it is un
derstood that there will be a sharp clash
between the National Committee and the
leaders of the party who are to come to St.
Louis to work for Bryan.
J. T. Flynn, delegate at large from Cali
fornia to the convention for the American
Bimetallic League, arrived in town to-day.
He is the editor of the Populist, published
in San Francisco. Mr. Flynn was not
long in town before he declared himself in.
favor of the indorsement of W. J. Bryan
of Nebraska for President. He thinks
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1896.
that both the Populists and the Silverites
will unfalteringly indorse the nomination
of the ooy statesman of the Platte.
"Do you think the convention will in
dorse the nomination of Bryan?" I in
quired.
"That is hard to tell," replied Mr.
Flynn. "There may be some doubt as to
the action of the convention. There is no
doubt as to what the Populists will do at
the polls, they will vote for Bryan. The
People's party stands for a principle and
it knows no bosses. No man carries the
vote or the indorsement of tbe Populists
in his pocket. It is a thing that belongs
to the people alone and they have already
made up their minds to vote for Bryan.
Any attempt to defeat that purpose will
result in the perpetual retirement of its
promoters. The Populists are nearer vic
tory to-day than the most enthusiastic
advocate hoped for, and they are not go
ing to throw that chance away by voting
against a man who differs from them only
in the name of his party. The fact that
Bryan stands upon a Democratic platform,
and especially such a platform as was con
structed at Chicago, is no disqualification.
There is very little between the Omaha
platform and the Chicago platform.
There will be no third party in the ri^ld,
at least so far as the Presidential electors
are concerned. The vote of silver will be
cast as a unit."
"How about the bimetallic convention;
will it offer any names to the public?"
"Yes, it will put up a candidate, and his
name is W. J. Bryan of Nebraska. There
will be no other name considered before the
convention. The bimetallists are in favor
of silver and they know that W. J. Bryan
is the most redoubtable champion the
white metal has ever had.
"His effort at the Democratic convention
the other day is only one of a thousand
such efforts. He is always the same, able,
hODest and eloquent. If it were possible
to get the 12,000,000 voters of this country
under one roof so that W. J. Bryan's voice
would reach them the election would be
over in one hour."
"How about Arthur Sewall? Will his
wealth be against him with the Populists ?"
"No, the Populists are not opposed to
wealth. It is the manner of accumulating
it that they object to. Arthur Sewall,
while a ricn man, has done much to pro
mote the industrial and commercial in
terests of the nation. I have seen the
white -winged messengers of commerce
owned by the Sewall family in nearly all
parts of the world. Wherever they went
the products of America went. That is
what we wantâ trade. Bryan and Sewall
will give it to us."
George P. Keeney, late of San Francisco,
but now of New York, general organizer
of the National Silver party, rearing a
linen suit of clothes, a straw hat and a
hopeful expression, arrived from Chicago
this morning. He had been in attendance
at the Democratic National Convention,
and acting under instiuction of his supe
riors came to St. Louis to hurry up the
Bryan boom. Mr. Keeney has had him
self interviewed in all the afternoon papers
and goes on record as saying that the
Nebraskan will carry New York and every
other State of importance from the Atlantic
to tbe Pacific. Standing in the lobby of
the Lindell, surrounded by a crowd of
growlers and silverites, the San Franciscan
delivered himseif of a Utopian speech.
Among other things he said:
"The reign of terror of the gold autocrats
is over. It is an open fight, and men who
two months ago sneered at me within the
last few days have acknowledged that if
they win at all it must be with their
money, for popular sentiment is against
them."
"Will the Silver Convention indorse
Bryan and Sewall?"
"For my part, it will, and I think that is
the sentiment of all men outside of the
regular Democratic organization who wish
to see the cause of free silver triumph. It
is the only logical thing to do."
Ex- Attorney-General W. H. Standish of
Grand Forks, N. D., chairman of the sil
ver party of nis State, is here to attend the
convention of his party. Asked if he
favored tha indorsement of Bryan and
Bewail by this convention, he said:
"Personally, I think it tne. proper and
logical thing to do. "What will be the
action of the convention 1 cannot forecast.
I believe, though, that the general senti
ment points that way. I am quite sure
that Bryan will get the Populist vote of
North Dakota, whether or not he is in
dorsed by the St. Louis convention."
Hon.. Andrew H. Paton of Danvers,
Mass., member of the Populist National
Committee by proxy from his State, regis
tered at the Lindell Hotel this morning.
He wore on his lapel a bright, new Bryan
button, and the enthusiasm with which he
talked for Bryan would have made one
think that he was fresh from the valley of
the Platte. Mr. Paton is the great inco
honee of the Improved Order of Red Men
of the United States.
"Will the Populist convention indorse
Bryan?". I asked. '-
"Whether or not it will be straight-out
indorsement or coalition," he said, "I
don't know; but as a patriotic party, de
sirous of reform, the Populists cannot and
will not dodge this issue or throw any
thing in the way of its success."

BRYAN'S VISIT TO
HIS BIRTHPLACE.
Greeted by an Enthusiastic
Gathering at Salem,
Illinois.
ADDRESSED OLD FRIENDS
Familiar Scenes Turned His
Thoughts to Home and
Kindred.
CHILDHOOD HOURS RECALLED.
Obligations of the Government to the
People Described by the
Nebraskan.
SALEM, 111., July 15.â Salem paid her
farewell to-day to William J. Bryan in a
grand demonstration that exceeded by far
the pyrotechnic reception given him on
his arrival here on Monday night Yes
terday morning the preparations were
begun and the result was the trans
formation of the candidate's birthplace
from an ordinary county seat to a place of
variegated color and lavish decoration. '
In front ot the old courthouse, where
Bryan made his maiden speech and wbere
his father presided as Circuit Judge for
many years, a platform had been erected
and was covered with red, white and blue
bunting and other embellishment. In re
sponse to a proclamation of Mayor Lakin
nearly every house floated the National
standard or some other adornment and
pictures of Bryan were prominent in
the windows of shops and private resi
dences.
Business was suspended and the whole
town prepared itself for making the day
the greatest that Salem ever experienced.
Excursions were run by the railroads, and
people from nearly all the neighboring
villages and the surrounding country took
advantage of the opportunity afforded by
cheap rates to hear Bryan. A promise
that Governor Altgeld would also make
an address was another attraction. Four
bands had been engaged for the occasion,
and three that helped the Salem orchestra
to make music headed delegations from
near-by towns.
A heavy wind and rain storm came at
noon, and for a while there was a stam
pede among the hundreds of visitors, who
believed a cyclone was imminent. The
rain ruined the decorations, and when it
ceased Salem presented a bedraggled ap
pearance. Courthouse Park was a mire,
and the 3000 people who were crowded
into the square had a very uncomfortable
standing-place.
A reception committee and several
bands escorted Mr. and Mrs. Bryan from
Mrs. Baird's residence to the park. Their
appearance was the signal for hearty
cheers.
L. M. Kagy presided at the meeting,
and alter prayer by F. B. Young, a
Methodist minister, he made a little
speech complimentary to Mr. Bryan, who
bad been his classmate at the Illinois
College, predicting Democratic victory in
November.
When the cheering had ceased Mr.
Bryan began spe-' '^ing. When he referred
to his father's and mother's recent death
there was much feeling in his tones. The
speech contained very little about politics,
and Mr. Bryan expressly disclaimed any
intention of making political speeches.
He said :
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I
have no disposition 10 talk politics to-day. I
shall leave ell discussion of party questions to
those who shall follow. Returning to the
%fents which surround my home, the mem
ories of other days crowd out all thoughts of
other subjects on which we may agree or dis
agree. I remember with gr&teful appreciation
the kindly feeling on church and party lines
when I lived among yon, and I shall not at
tempt to divide by party lines those who are
here to-day. This is the home of my birth and
early manhood. Three blocks south is my
birthplace; a mile southwest is the home ot
my early boyhood. I shall never fail to be
grateful to my parents for taking me to the
farm where I gained the physical strength
that enabled me to stand the rigors of a
political lite.
Mr. Bryan referred to the adjacent court
house as the place where he made bis tirst
political speech, and to other places iden
tified with his political career, and was
app'.audeii when he added, "It was here
that I first brought her who came to share
life's joys and sorrows with me." He
could not forget, he said, those whose
kindly faces smiled upon him before for
tune smiled. He referred to the near-by
graveyard and spoke feelingly of the dead
father and mother. "I cannot forget this
place or these people," said the orator,
"and I cannot to-day express in words all
that I feel."
1 believe that there is an ideal plane in poli
tics and I believe I stand upon it to-day. We
meet recognizing the differences of feel
ing, but vrita charity toward each other. We
are all imbued with the same spirit, all imbued
with the same ambitions, all aiming to carry
out the same purposes. We want government
of the people, for the people and by the people,
and If we differ as to the means we cannot
differ as honest citizens, but only in purpose.
I thank the Republicans who are assembled
here, I thank the Prohibitionists, I thank the
Populists as much as I do the Democrats, be
cause, my friÃnds, when these questions which
rise to the lurface and agitate people have
passed away we then understand those funda
mental principles which underlie our Gov
ernment.
We all agree in this, that when the Govern
ment comes in contact with the citizen and
the citizen with the Government, we all stand
equal before the law. We agree that the Gov
ernment can be no rcspector of person, and
that its strength, its matchless strength, must
be the protection of the fortunes of the great
and the business of the poor; that it shall
stand an impartial arbiter between its citizens.
We believe that governments derive their just
powers from the consent of the governed. We
know no divine right of kings. These citizens
are those upon whom rest the responsibilities
of government, and whiie each strives in his
own way to bring the Government lo be a fit
expression of the v^oplei vfe cannot agree on
those minor points which separate us.
It was here I received my first instructions
in Democracy. It was here I learned the
truth of the saying that clothes don't make
the man. But all who have the good of the
country at heart â all these stand on a com
mon ground and all are citizens. TheseÂ£are
the basic principles upon which rests the
greatest nation on earth. I believe in the pro
gress of the race. Talk not to me of crisis
through which we cannot pass or obstacles too
great to overcome. I know none such. A
patriotic people are ready to meet every emer
gency as it arises and as each generation rises
I believe it wili be better fitted to perform the
work of progress than the one before.
; It was here that I learned freedom of con*
I science. Every man has the right to worship
God according to his own conscience, and no
man shall dictate how a man shall serve his
God. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. Bryan quoted Abraham r Lincoln's
famous Gettysburg speech, referring to
the. absolute confidence with which the
Nation might look to the people in time
of danger; and in conclusion, said:' "My
friends, here and throughout the land, the
Nation can look with confidence to that
patriotism and courage .which will meet
every danger." ' :
Mrs. Bryan was presented to the audi
ence and was given a hearty greeting, to
which she responded with a bow. Several
other speakers' were heard and the meet
ing was voted a great success.

CLEVELAND BOLTS.
Ha Will Advocate an Independent
Democratic Honest-Money
Ticket.
CHICAGO, 111., July 16.â A local paper
prints the following Washington dis
patch :
President Cleveland will advocate an
independent Democratic honest-money
ticket. From a source so high that it is
known to be authentic, the information
comes that he will announce pnblinly in
some way that he favors the nomination
of two men who will represent the sound
money standard as presidential candidates
in the campaign now on.
SENTIMENT DIVIDED.
Populists Do Not Know Whether
They Will Follow Bryan or
Nominate Another.
ST. LOUIS, lao., July 15.â As the time
approaches for the assembling of the Peo
ple's party National Convention the divi
sion of sentiment between support of
Bryan and independent action becomes
sharply defined. At tbe party head
quarters there is uneasiness. Chairman
Taubeneck has committed himself to
Teller, whiie tbe burden of the majority of
the telegrams and letters received there
favor the indorsement of Bryan.
A meeting of the National Committee is
called for Saturday morning. One serious
question which faces the Populists is the
attitude of the Silver party, whose repre
sentative on the ground, Dr. J. J. Mott of
North Carolina, practically confesses that
bis party will almost assuredly indorse
Bryan. This is a decided reversal of form
in comparison with the original policy of
the Silver party.
Dr. Mott said to-day in answer to a ques
tion as to whether his party's convention
would indorse the Chicago nominee and
platform: "l would not be surprised; in
fact I expect that it will. All we want is
silver's Bucceas, and the surest way of get
ting it is the one we will adopt."
Dr. Mott said there will be no side issues
âthe tariff or anything elseâ introduced
to interfere with the progress of the coo
vention, though the fact that this would
be the first convention ever held by them
might prolong the sessions at least two
days.
George P. Keeney, general organizer of
the National Silver party, arrived to-day.
He is firmly of the opinion that his party
will indorse Bryan.
"Cyclone" Davis, the Texas Populist, is
one of to-day's arrivals who opposes the
indorsement of Bryan and favors Teller.
"With Teller," said he, "we could carry
all the Southern States, not one of which
will approve the indorsement of Bryan.
The Populist party must maintain its own
identity."
P. V. Elliott, a Montana Populist and a
leading Knight of Labor, takes the oppo
site view. "We must insure the success
of silver," he said, "for that is the issue
before the people to-day. lam in favor of
the election of Bryan, and shall work for
his indorsement by the People's party."
Delegate Patton of Massachusetts is here
working for the indorsement of Bryan.
Ex-Governor John P. Buchanan of Ten
nessee is also for Bryan : He said to-day :
"An indorsement would not be returning
to the Democratic partyâ the party would
be returning to us. True Populism is pure
Democracy â Jeffersonian Democracy
and the origin of the People's party was
tbe departure from pure Democracy by
the Democratic party when it allowed
Cleveland and the Eastern contingent to
take the hplm. In adopting the Populist
platform and nominating a man like
Bryan, the Democrats have returned to
principles of pure Democracy."
The silver party convention will have
1200 delegates.
ANDREW D. WHITE BOLTS.
Though a Life-Long Democrat He
Cannot Lend Indorsement
to Anarchy.
ITHACA, N. V., July 15.â 1n an open
letter to J. Sterl ng Morton, William L.
Wilson and others Hon. Andrew D.
White, a life-long Democrat, repudiates
the Chicago platform and ticket.
"The majority, masquerading under the
garb of Democracy at Chicago, has done
its worst," he 3ays. "It has made a plat
form which is diametrically opposed to
Democracy as developed by Jefferson,
Jackson, Benton, Seymour, Tilden and all
the great leaders of the party. More than
this, it is a platform leading logically and
historically to a despotism which is the
very opposite of all Democracy, and in
which all Democracy and Republicanism
worthy of the name would be extin
guished. You know how contemptuously
all efforts to mitigate its most deadly
features wero repelled, but, bad as this is,
it is not the worst.
"For you must know, too, that it is but
the first installment of anarchist doc
trines. If not resisted and overwhelmed
now it is absolutely certain to be followed
by other parts of the programme, es
pecially the absorption of the bonds and
stocks oi railroads, telegraphs and vari
ous productive enterprises of the country,
with payment for them, if at all, m a
paper currency of nominal value, and
their management by the central Govern
ment, under the cry that all such things
have been built up for the people, belong
to the people and should be managed by
the people. Nor will confiscation stop
even here. Other extreme measures are
already vaguely foreshadowed ana will be
pushed, and some which even the boldest
have hardly dared hint at will yet be put
in platforms to attract new votes of cranks
and dupes and in the hope that perhaps
some new folly may obviate, modify or
obscure the consequences of the old."

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 15.-only
seven silver men gathered at the English

Those seven adopted a motion instructing

MRS. AVERTS ELOQUENT TALK
Tho Ohio Man Says Woman's Ad
vancement Is the Best Thing
in Civilization.
CANTON, Ohio, July 15. â0n their spe
cial train, with their own band, several
hundred Cleveland women came to Can
ton this morning to call upon Major Mc-
Kinley and congratulate him upon his
nomination. A fast and furious summer
rain fell throughout most of the morning,
but did not prevent Canton people from
turning out in large numbers with a cor
dial good-will to welcome their fair visiN
ors. The Cleveland delegation was met at
the station by a large committee of Can
ton women under the leadership of Mrs.
Miller, president of the Sorosis Society.
The Cleveland women marched from the
railway station to the residence of Major
McKinley. He was standing on the porch
to receive them. The speech of congratu
lation was made on the part of the visitors
by Mrs. Elroy Avery of Cleveland, State
regent of the Daughters of the Revolution.
Mrs. Avery spoke at some length. She
said in part: \
We come from a city of great American in
dustries, which industries are suffering from
un-American legislationâ an unfortified city
on the border, facing the Canadian frontier,
and yet recognizing that our best protection
against foreign aggression is a protective
tariff.
We have come to greet you not as politicians,
but as women, as wives and mothers and sis
ters. We cannot cast one vote for you, and yet
we love our country ; we desire and through
you we seek her prosperity and glory. We
know that when you enter at the door of the
White House peace and comfort will enter at
our doors; that when you receive your heri
tage by the decree of a grateful people our
husbands and fathers will receive the fruits of
their industry, and the heart of the wife and
mother will be made glad.
Every woman living is interested in the
money question. If our husbands earn the
money we spend, and we intend to spend it
without pleading guilty to the charge of a
weakness for the bargain counter, every thrifty
woman wants her few dollars to have as great
a purchasing power as possible; to be worth
100 cents; to be convertible into twenty
pounds of sugar, not ten. We stand ready to
welcome every one who refuses to dwell longer
in the tents of the opposition, and to bind up
the wounds of every one who, breaking loose
from the already disintegrating ranks of the
enemy and placing patriotism above party,
Dledges his support to the advance agent of
prosperity.
Mrs. Avery's speech was heartily and
frequently applauded.
In response to Mrs. Avery's remarks
Governor McKinley said in part:
Mrs. Avery: I greatly appreciate this
friendly call and assure you that I do not
undervalue the gracious message you have so
eloquently delivered. It is an assurance of
the deep interest which you feel and which
should be felt by every family in the land in
the public questions of the day and their right
ful settlement at the polls. There is no limit
ation to the influence that may be exerted by
women in the United States and no adequate
tribute can be Bpoken of her services to man
kind throughout its long and eventful history.
The work of women has been a power in every
emergency and always for good. Her influence
in the home, the church, the school and the
community, in molding character for every
profession and duty to whicn our race is con
nected, has been potential and sublime.
One of the beet things of our civilization in
America is the constant advancement of
woman to a higher plane of labor and re
sponsibility. The opportunities for her are
greater now than ever before. This is sin
gularly true here, where practically every
avenue of human endeavor is open to her.
Her impress Is felt in urt, science, literature,
song and government. The home over which
the trusted wife presides is the ideal of our
strengthâ the best guaranty of good citizen
ship and sound morals in government. It i 3
at the foundation; upon it all else is con
structed. I congratulate you upon what
woman has done for grand and noble objects
in the past. I rejoice with you at the wider
and broader field of the present and the
splendid vista of the future, which is every
where opening up for you- I again thank you
for your presence here and for this manifesta
tion of your regard and good will.
Major McKinley was frequently ap
plauded. When he finished speafcing there
was an earnest cheer, and then Miss Bir
delle Switzer of Cleveland steppsd forth
and presented Mrs. McKinley with a large
basket of handsome roses. The band, com
posed of women, played, and a song writ
ten for the occasion by Mrs. Stewart, pres
ident of the Cleveland Sorosis, was sung
by Mrs. Mary Ellsworth Clark, one of
Cleveland's sweetest singers. The women
fell into line while the band was playing,
and for nearly three-quarters of an hour
Major McKinley shook hands with his
visitors.
The band which accompanied, the Cleve
land delegation was composed of v.-omen,
who used fans visorously when they were
not blowing the big horns. It is a good
band and its members did not resemble
professional musicians in the least. There
were no professional female agitators or
reformers among the hundreds who came
to Canton to-day.

COLONEL IRISH IS ANGRY.
He Says He Is a Democrat, Not a
Dynamitter, and Wil! Not
Support Bryan.
IOWA CITY, lowa, July 15.â John P.
Irish of Oakland, Cal., was here on his
way home from the Chicago convention
yesterday. In an interview be scathingly
denounced the Chicago convention, say
ing:
"I will not support tbe platform nor the
candidate, for I am a Democrat, not a
dynamiter. The platform is a league with
larceny and a covenant with murder. The
candidate is a raw man who has achieved
nothing in public or private life to fit him
for the Presidency. California will give
15,000 majority against the platform and
candidate. The Democratic party in 1853
established the single gold standard and
buried silver as unlimited money. The
act of 1873 simply put a new headstone to
an old grave. The Chicago platform at
every point antagonizes every principle
held by the Democracy since 1801. Jeffer
son's declarations concerning the standard
of value and the ratio between gold and
silver were ignored at Chicago. The party
he founded was strumpeted to as corrupt
and criminal a combination as ever robbed
a stage."
SPEAKER REED'S OPINION.
He Thinks Sewall's Nomination
Will Break Up the Democratic
Party In Maine.
CHICAGO, 111., July 15.â A special dis
patch from Boston says that a correspond
ent for a local paper had a talk with
Speaker Reed at Old Orchard, Me., yester
day. When asked his opinion of tbe cam
paign outlook Mr. Reed said:
"I do not care to say much, but Mr.
Allen and myself are practically of the
same opinion, so you had better interview
Mr. Allen."
Mr. Allen, Mr. Reed's closest political
friend and adviser, said: "The action of
the Chicago convention in nominating
Mr. Sewall for the Vice-Presidency on a
silver platform after the Democrats of
Maine had selected their candidates for
State and County offices on a gold plat
form, is, to say the least, strange. -
"I do not think that Sewall will be able
to carry his own city, much less the Btate.
Apparently the only . reason the Demo
crats nominated Sewall is, he is the only
wealthy Democrat in the East who favors
the free coinage of silver, and they thins
that by his nomination they will be able
to draw Eastern voters. Possibly he may,
but Ido not ink he will.
"In my opinion the nomination of
Sewall will be more than likely to break
up the organization of the Democratic
party in Maine. This will be the inevita
ble result, unless the Democratic State
campaign in Maine is conducted entirely
independent of the National campaign."

FILLING THE VACANCIES.
New Members Appointed on the
Republican National Execu
tive Committee.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 15.â The Re
publican National Executive Committee
was in session to-day for several hours.
Shortly before 4 o'clock the committee ad
journed until to-morrow. Senator Quay
left at once for home.
Mr. Hanna announced to the newspaper
men that Myron M. Parker had been se

mittee for the District of Columbia and C.
S. Johnson member for Alaska. The Colo
rado vacancy was not tilled. Mr. Hanna
further announced that it had been de
cided to open campaign headquarters both
in New York and Chicago.
"Who will be in cuarge?" was asked.
"The chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee," be answered. "He
will be in the saddle, so to speak, and be
found at both places. They will be of
equal power, importance and scope."
Beyond this the chairman declined to
talk.

STATE CONVENTION
McKinley, Hobart and Pro
tection Heartily In
dorsed.
BIMETALLISM FAVORED.
The Platform Adopted by the
St Louis Convention
Reaffirmed.
SILVER STANDARD OPPOSED.
William P. Hepburn Said Democratic
Success Would Be a National
Calamity.
DES MOINES, lowa, July-15.â The Re
publican State Convention to-day adopted
resolutions reaffirming the St. Louis plat
form of the party, with a paragraph
pledging the lowa delegation in Congress
to faithful work in behalf of international
bimetallism and giving a hearty indorse
ment to McKinley and Hobart and the
protective-tariff system. A complete State
ticket, including Presidential electors, was
named.
Chairman McMillan of the State Central
Committee called the convention to order
at 11 o'clock and announced that on ac
count of the illness of Rolla M. Wilson of
Fairfield. who had been selected for tempo
rary chairman, Congressman William P.
Hepburn of Clarinda would preside over
the temporary organization. The selection
of Congressman Hepburn was due to a de
sire to please those rrembers of the party
who are inclined to be favorable to silver,
because of his record at St. Louis against
the adoption of an explicit declaration in
favor of the poid standard.
Some of the gold men were inclined to
object to the selection, but were appeased
by a promise that Congressman Hepburn
would indorse the St. Louis platform in
his address. This he did, following the
indorsement with a long argument in
favor of international bimetallism, which
be delared to be the Republican doctrine
and the only true bimetallism. He de
clared that the true indorsement at the
polls of the Democratic platform adopted
at Chicago would mean a calamity to the
Nation worse than the Civil War.
"I challenge," he said, "a comparison
of the Chicago platform with the Populist
platform adopted at Omaha four years
ago. There is no essential difference.
Both advocate repudiation." Ho closed
with a declaration, sustained by historical
references, that the Republican party is
t c only party which has ever done any
thing for silver.
At the close of Congressman Hepburn's
address the regular committees were
named, and the convention adjourned to
2 p. m.
Upon reconvening the committee on
credentials reported full delegations
present and no contests. The committee
on permanent organization presented the
the name of Smith McPherson of Red Oak
for permanent chairman. Both reports
were adopted. Mr. McPherson, on assura
in<r the chair, spoke briefly. He gave a
cordial indorsement to the gold standard.
At the opening of the Civil War, he said,
thousands of Democrats rallied to the
support of the Republican party in the
defense of the Union, and now the Re
publican party calls upon the loyal Demo
crats of the country to rally to the rescue
of tbe Nation's honor.
The platform as finally reported from
the committee was adopted without debate.
It indorses the St. Louis platform and
pledges the lowa delegation in Congress
to work to secure the free coinage of silver
through international agreement and at
an international ratio.
Tbe financial plank continues: "We
recognize the revolutionary character of
the platform adopted at Chicago. We
appreciate the danger of its startling doc
trines and the immeasurable disasters that
would follow their adoption by the Gov
ernment. We are opposed to a change to
a single silver standard because it will de
crease and not increase the supply of
money in the country; because instead of
restoring confidence it will destroy credits,
instead of inspiring enterprise it will
spread alarm, instead of aiding the debtor
it will involve him in bankruptcy, instead
of furnishing employment to labor it will
make more uncertain and unremunerative
that which it has, instead of benefiting the
producers it wiil injure them, and, finally,
because it would do infinite injustice and
involve our country in repudiation and
dishonor."
NO HOPE FOR
THE COLOMBIA,
f Continued from Writ Page.}
might be necessary to remove them in a
hurry, and they wanted to put them into
shape. This is altogether probable. It
will only take enough water to roll the
ship over and leave her bottom-up in the
breakers.
The steam schooners, Newsboy and
Jewel, are lying by the Colombia. The
Newsboy was busy hoisting tons of coffee
by the sack out of the Colombia's hold and
dropping it into her own. The steam
winch pot no rest Bince early in the morn
ing. Tne Jewel lies out a way, awaiting
her turn. She will tie up alongside when
the Newsboy i 3 loaded. The latter will
try and take all the coffee and the Jewel
the remainder of the cargo, which is gen
eral merchandise and baggage. Most of
the carpo will be taken out undamaged, as
ut. to this evening there was water in the
compartment forward only.
The fishermen and farmers in the vicin
ity of Pigeon Point may have had a
famine for many years, as to Central
American fruit, but they are having a
feast now. Ihe fisherman's boat in which
a Call representative was rowed out to
the wreck from Lighthouse Point this
morning was nearly half filled with Cen
tral American limes. The enterprising
Doatnaan had picked them np from the
surf and from the water near the ship.
They were a part of the Colombia's
burst cargo. Thousands of the yellow
fruit floated in the sea.
Captain Clark was rather nncommuni
cative this morning on the subject of
shipwrecks. He answered questions in
monosyllables instead of sentences. The
captain simply reiterated that he mistook
the New Years Island fog whistle for the
Pigeon Point fog whistle, and tbat is
about all there is to it, and about all he
had to say. When he heard the Pigeon
Point whistle he believed it was the toot
of another vessel and changed his course
to starboard. Five minutes later the
Colombia was crunching in among the
rocks. If the rocks had not stopped her
in another half minute she would have
bad her nose buried in the sand of the
beach.
Third Officer Thompson, who was on
watch on the bridge when the Colombia
struck, told the best story of how it hap
pened.
'We had passed New Years Island light
and thought it was Pigeon Point," he
said. "The captain was on the bridge with
me. We were listening for tbe fog signals
and did not hear any, after passing New
Years, until we were about where we
stand now. Then we beard two short
whistles, close together, and thought it
was another vessel. The captain com
manded 'Hard a-starboard !' and down
went the wheel hard a-starboard. In about
five minutes she struck. She went on
easy, but we could hfar her crunching on
the rocks. The fog was so thick it could
be scooped up with a shovel. I was on the
bridge and I couldn't see the bow of the
ship. You can almost throw a line ashore
now, but we could not see the shore. I
saw breakers and shouted 'Breakers
ahead !' but it was too late then."
"Do you think the ship can be saved?"
â¢'I fear not," he replied. The vessel
rocked and rolled and pounded against
the bottom while tbis conversation took
place. Third Officer Thompson had to use
his best sea legs to keep on his feet.
"Isn't there danger of her snapping a
spar?" was asked.
"That's what I'm looking out for," re
plied Ship's Surgeon Arberry.
"That Pigeon Point whistle ought to be
changed," resumed Third Officer Thomp
son. "It sounds too much like a steamer.
It was very low and the instant we heard it
we went to starboard to get out of the
way. The whistles ought to be longer or
shorter or more of them."
Captain James Marner is the keeper of
the Pigeon Point light station. He has
been there eight years. Captain Marner
is a typical lighthouse-keeper. He has
the breeze of the sea in his jovial air. In
regard to the criticism of his fog signals,
he said :
"The fog signals are fixed by the Gov
ernment. My duty is to see tbat they are
carried out and the whistles blown. I
blew my whistles from 11 :35 o'clock on
the night of the 13th to 12:25 o'clock on
the afternoon of the 14th, when the fog
lifted. I heard the ship go on the rocks.
The noise could be heard plainly up here.
I thought at first she was the Madrona,
but when the fog raised I saw a big black
ship. Mv signal is a whistle of four sec
onds' duration, an interval of seven sec
onds, another blast of four seconds and
tben an interval of forty-five seconds and
then repeat. That of the New Years j
Island light is a blast of ten seconds' dura
tion, an interval of fifty seconds and re
peat.
'Now, the captain of the Colombia has
nobody but himself to blame," continued
Captain Marner. "He has his charts, maps
and books to tell him where he is, and I
do not see how he came to^get in so clo^e.
His books would have told him which was
the Pigeon Point licht. But I cannot talk
much. Captain Clark will be examined in
the City, and I will be subpenaed."
J. C. Williamson, a merchant of Pesca
dero, says the Colombia is the fifth vessel
to go ashore in the six miles between
Pigeon Point and New Years Islaud. The
ship Sir John Franklin was the first to go
ashore. This was in 1868, and seventeen
lives were lost. A torn os tone on the island
marks the disaster. The barK Carrier was
wrecked on that treacherous shore in 1869.
She was coal-laden, and twenty-one lives
were lost. In 1857 the ship Courier was
wrecked on the point. The ship Hellespont
was wrecked in 1870, in almost the sane
spot as the Colombia.
At 10 o'clock to-night the Colombia was
lying somewhat easier. She did not pound
so hard, and that change in her condition,
if it is permanent, may prove her salva
tion in the event that there la no rough
weather. She seems to have slipped
around into an easier berth on the sand,
but she still rolls badly. This afternoon at
low tide the steam-schooners were ex
tremely cautious in approaching her and
lying alongside. The swell was heavier,
and the waterlogged Colombia reeled fear
fully. The Newsboy anchored as far away
as she could without interrupting the work
of lightening. Her sides were protected
by bales of hay to prevent the Colombia
from crushing' them in. Frequently the
steamship on her backward reel would
strike the schooner a hard blow, but the
hay prevented damage, though the con
cussion several times knocked the men off
their feet.
The work of lightening continued to
night, small boats carrying the cargo from
tbe ship to the schooners which were
anchored a considerable distance away.
About ail the coffee is unloaded, but there i
are tons and tons of j>ew York merchan- !
disc yet to come out. Underwriters'
Agent Metcalfe says that further salvage
of the cargo will necessitate the use of
two scow schooners, and he will send to
San Francisco for them. The plan and
the hope of the underwriters and of Cap
tain Clark is to take out ail of the cargo as
steedilv as possible, then pull tbe Colom
bia off the rocks and tow her to San Fran
cisco. This is considered possible if she
is not stove in more and water does not
get in any compartment other than the
one forward.
The Coiombia to-night lay in the inky
blackness of the little bay, a spectacle of
light Her donkey-engine was running,
and the electric light plant was in lull
blast. The liguts twinkled in trie dark
ness as she rolled first over toward the
land and tben back toward the open sea.
Hundreds of feet above the lighthouse
stood, flashing a warning of the Colom
bia's fate to the other vessels, which could
be seen with their red, green and white
lights, passing safely by on the sea's high
way.
WILL BE DISMANTLED.
An- Attempt to Bare the Steamer's En
gine* Will . Be Made.
The BprecKels tug Reliance returned
from the Colombia wreck yesterday after
noon, with Superintending Engineer
Hawxhurst of the Mail Company and the
stewardess of the steamer aboard. When
they left the vessel was , pounding and
every fall knocked a hole in the hull. â .:
"There is no hope of saving the vessel,"
said Captain- John - Bilovich of the Reli
ance. "She is hard and fast forward, and
the tide rises and falls, in her hold just the
same as it does on the coast. , All the cargo
is dropping out of her. bottom and tne sea
is strewn with broken. cases,' limes, coffee
and other material that will float. <
\ "Captain Clark â :, was evidently making
time, as the Colombia must: have been
going about : thirteen or fourteen knots an
hour when . she struck. : Her forward part
has been 1 ripped away, and I'll guarantee
there â is â¢ a hole *â  in â¢ her ; bow into which I
could â¢ put : the : Reliance, smokestack i and
all. Apart from this she is strained all
over, and the water is rising two or three
inches an v hour in every compartment.
When she falls with the tide and strikes
the rocks the hull quivers from stem to
stern, and .the \ crew lives in hourly ex
pectation of the steamer going to pieces. .
"If the worst conies to the .worst the
steamer will be dismantled and an attempt
tsanmMHMHMMHaimHMMBIHi
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1896.
made to save her engines. About half a
mile away the tug Vigilant lies at anchor
and is ready at a moment's notice to go to
the assistance of the stranded vessel.
Should a blow spring up, the Vigilant will
be there to take off the crew.
"How did the Colombia come to go
ashore? Well, as near as I can get at it,
it was this way: When they picked up
New Years Island, Captain Clark thougnt
he was opposite Pigeon Point and shaped
his course northwest by north. A few
minutes later he heard another whistJe
and thinking it was an ocean steamer
bound southward altered his course half a
point and was brought up standing about
a mile below Pigeon Point.
"Had Captain Clark's calculations, been
correct he would have been away clear of
Pigeon Point, and even with his deviation
of half a point would have cleared the
whistling buoy without any trouble.
Great credit should be given the Fort
Point life-saving station. As' soon as the
captain heard there was danger he got his
apparatus together ana launched the boat.
When the Vigilant passed they were ready
and at once got a line aboard." They were
towed to Pigeon Point, and when we left
they were lying alongside the water-logged
hull r*ady to render assistance at a mo
ment's notice."
When the Colombia struck on the rocks
at Pigeon Point she was nearly two days
ahead of time. Tbis was not the captain's
fault, however, as ne was simp'y obeying
instructions in attempting to make up
time lost between New York and Panama
via Colon. The steamer Finance from
New York arrived at Colon two days be
fore the Colombia arrived at Panama. In
consequence tbe cabin passengers had to
put up at hotels, and many of the steerage
passengers who were out of funds had to
walk the streets until the Colombia put in
an appearance.

sengers of the Colombia, evidences that

EXAMINED BY A DIVER.
The Latest New* From the Wrecked Mail
/steamer Colombia.
At 2 o'clock this morning the tug Vigil
ant returned from the wrecked steamer and
the captain reported that to ail appear
ances the vessel is doomed, slowly rocking
to pieces in the ground swell.
The diver went on board the Colombia
and made an external examination of the
vessel, but no attempt was made to go
below the surface of the water.
He expressed no opinion upon the feas
ability of atlemDting to get the steamer off
tbe rocks.
That there is but little hope of saving
Â«he big vessel is apparent by the return of
th.* Vigilant.
Wh*n the tug left the wreck the crew
was still on board.
Tramp* Invade a Woodland Ranch.
WOODLAND, Cal., July 15.-A desper
ate fight occurred on the Coil ranch, near
this city, to-day between H. E. Coil and
several hired men against a Rang of va
erantÃ. Early this morning the tramps
called at tbe house and requested thai the
cook prepare a breakfast for them. On
being refused, they said they would take
tneiood by force. The cook called Mr.
CoiJ, and he and the hired men gave the
hobos a . sound thrashing. One of them
was baaiy beaten.
TROOPS ARE OUT
AT CLEVELAND,
Police Utterly Incapable of

Strikers.
GUARD NON-UNION MEN
Repeated Charges With Fixed
Bayonets Necessary to
Protect Them.
STREETS BLOCKED WITH MEN.
Home of a Non-Union Man Riddled
With Stonesâ Bloodshed Is
Threatened.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Juiy 15.â T0-night
two companies of the Fifth Regiment are
camped inside the bridge workshop of the
Brown Hoisting Company and will remain
there indefinitely. The police have
proved utterly incapable of restraining the
mob of striKers and to-night when tne few
men at work were marched out a crowd of
15,000 men was assembled in the streets
about tbe works, and way for the wagons
containing the men and police escort
could only be made by the troops charging
the crowd with fixed bayonets. There was
hooting and threats of vengeanace.
To-night the home of one of the non
union men was completely riddled with
stones. It is feared that to-morrow will
witness more of the guerrilla tactics iv
beating the "scabs" as they go to work.
The Brown Company refuses absolutely
to arbitrate.
The strikers, on learning last night that
the company was recruiting its non-union
forces in Canada ana Cincinnati, organ
ized committees of ten and twenty men
each. They were given a section of terri
tory to patrol and look for non-union
men. The committees were on duty early
this morning. As the non-union men
traversed the streets in the neighborhood
of the works they were attacked and
beaten with clubs and other weapons.
Many hundred men climbed on the street
cars, the speed of which, when increased,
threw men violently to the pavements.
Several were injured. Tne rioters paraded
the streets wilhin two blocks of the
vicinity of the works. The police were
utterly unable to cope with the strikers
in this guerrilla fighting and so Mayor
McKisson ordered a company of militia to
the scene of the rioting.
BERING SEA ADJUSTERS,
Great Britain and Uncle Sam
Trying to Settle Their
Differences.
Each Nation Selects a Commissioner,
Who May Appoint a Third, if
Necessary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 15.â A
further step was taken by Great Britain
and the United States several days ago in
the matter of a consideration of the
British claims against this country for
seizures in previous years in Bering Sea.
The announcement was first made in the
United Press dispatches that a treaty pro
viding for the appointment of a joint
commission of two to adjust these claims
was then in process of construction be
tween Secretary Olney and her Majesty's
Embassador, Sir Julian Pauncefote.
This treaty was subsequently ratified by
the Senate. It provides, in addition to
one representative on the part of each
government, for a third commissioner in
the event that the original commissioners
fail to agree. The British Government
nas selected George E. King, one of the
Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada,
while the United States commissioner is
Judge William L. Putnam of the First
United States Judicial Circuit. The com
missioners will meet at Victoria, B. C,
which was selected because of its prox
imity to the scene of the seizures, but
probably not until next autumn.
INCREASING SILVER COINAGE.
Condition of the Treasury Makes Such a
Course Mecessary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 15.â Owing
to the fact that the amount of silver dol
lars in the treasury available for the re
demption of treasury notes has been re
duced to $10,569,852, and will be further
reduced by redemption during the current
month, the coinage of silver dollars at the
mints will be increased from $1,500,000 to
$3,000,000 the Ist of August, and will
probably be continued at that rate in
order that the treasury may have suffi
cient stock to redeem treasury notes. The
amount of treasury notes redeemed in sil
ver dollars and canceled from November
1, 1893, to July 1, 1896. was $28,402,258.
Â«
Gold Withdrawals Continue.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 15.â Gold
withdrawals to-day amounted to $1,184,
-900, leaving the reserve at the close of
business at $97,355,278. Of the with
drawals to-day $900,000 was in coin for ex
port.

LOS ANGELES
POKER SHARPS,
Lawyer Dole Claims His
Winnings Landed Him
in Prison
PLAYED WITH A FORGER
Given a Raised Check When He
Settled With the Man
Who Lost.
DEPOSITED IT IN A BANK.
Arrested in San Francisco and Ac
cused of Altering the
Draft.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 15.â One of
the most hotly contested cases ever before
the courts here is under way at this time.
The prosecution is trying hard to convict
Attorney E. J. Dole of raising a check on
a fianta Ana bank from $2 50 to $850. Dole
was recently arrested in San Francisco and
brought here for trial.
Dole was on the stand in his own behalf
this afternoon. When shown the raised
check he admitted that be had bees the
owner of it at one time. On the morning
of the 11th of February, Dole said, he came
to Los Angeles from Riverside. While
never having been a professional gambler,
he had occasionally indulged in card
games.
On February 20 he went to Black's pool
room and had a conversation with a man
named King, who introduced him to an
other named Adams. Dole consented to
co to a room in the Vickery block, where
they engaged in a game of poker. Dole
won $750 and was paid with a certified
check which Adams had drawn from his
pocket. This check is the one which had
been raised from $2 50 to $850. King had
a $50 interest in tbe check, and there was a'
small amount coming to Adams. These
amounts, Dole says, be paid in cash, and
after leaving he deposited the check at the
State Loan and Trust Company to his
credit. He had not the least idea that the
paper was altered. On the following day
he left for San Francisco, where he was
later taken into custody.
The Arroyo Seco Spanned.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 15.â The
great steel-girder bridge of the Santa Fe
Railroad across the Arroyo Seco, between

pleted. It is 750 feet in length and cost
$45,000. It is the intention of the com
pany to construct eight more steel bridges
on the system by the first of next year.
FRESNO'S GATES OPENED,
Supervisors Grant a Franchise
to the Valley Railroad
Company.
The Line Alon? Q Street to Consist
of But a Single
Track
FRESNO, Cal., July 15.â The Board of
Supervisors to-day granted a franchise to
the San Francisco and San Joaquin Rail
way Company to run a railway track over
the public highways in the, county on
which the route has been surveyed. The
franchise is to extend for fifty years. The
road strikes the first public highway and
Blackstone avenue in Belmont Addition
north of the city. The route then extends
along Diana street to the limits of the city,
where it runs in upon Q street. The rail
road company wanted a franchise for two
tracks along Diana, but property-owners
on that Btreet objected and a majority of
the Supervisors recognized their claims.
The franchise was allowed for one track
only. Diana street is several blocks in
length, and where It reaches the city it is
some distance from the depot site for
the road.
The privilege of running the road out
East avenue and south per the survey of
the Hanford route was also granted.
There was no objection to the granting of
the franchise except that of the Diana
street property-owners. Among the reser
vations made by tbe board is that the
iailroad company shall construct such
suitable crossings for wagons at such
places as the Supervisors shall select.
The ordinance is to take effect on August 3.
The case of the Q-atreet property-owners,
who have prepared to tight the railroad
company in the courts for damages which
they allege will be done to their proper
ties by the passing of the road, is at a
standstill. No step is being taken at pres
ent by either side to settle the difficulty.
DOT TOP AGAIN ARRESTED.
Taken to San Francisco to Answer to â¢
Chmrge of Robbery.
FRESNO, Cal., July 15.â Among the
passengers on tht northbound train who
left Fresno last Saturday morning was J.
E. Bagsdale, the night watchman in China
town, and a deputy constable. Accom
panying Ragsdale was a Chinese girl
named Doy Toy, whom he had arrested
on a warrant from San Francisco charging
her with robbery.
Deputy Constable Ragsdale had an ex
citine time in effecting the arrest. He was
assisted by a brother deputy named John
Dumas. Ragsdale received a warrant for
Toy's arrest early on Friday. He knew
that her friends in Fresno would assist her
if they coula, for thÂ»Â»re is a fight between
them and San Francisco Mongols for the
possession of the maid.
The two deputies waited on Saturday
morning until fifteen minutes before the
time for the arrival of the northbound
train, which is due at 3 o'clock. The
officers then made a descent upon the
house in Chinatown where Toy was stop
pine. Ragsdale bad learned the location
of the girl's apartment.
He and Dumas rushed into the house
and ran to the woman's room, intending
to take her by surprise; but Toy heard
them coming and sprang from bed and
ran up into an attic of the house. Rags
dale saw her and followed. He found her
crouching in a dark corner of the attic,
trembling with fear. They hurried her to
the train and Ragsdale took her to San
Francisco.
The friends of Toy in this city are loud
in denunciation of the officers' conduct.
They say that the warrant sent here was
not sufficient and was sworn ont in San
Francisco by Toy's husband, who several
months ago sold her tor $2000. The
charge, they say, was trumped up for the
purpose of catching her. Twice she has
run away from her husband and come to
this city, only to be recaptured.

FIGHT I NG FOR WATER RIGHTS.
Rival hleetrie Companies at Xresno Loch
Horn*.
FRESNO, Cal., July 15.â The electric
company which recently brought electric
power and light to this city from the
North Fork of the San Joaquin River, at
a point thirty-five miles east of here, will
probably have to fight in the courts for
the possession of the water in the river
which supplies power to tne plant. Since
the introduction of the scheme the elec
tric company has had the enmity of the
old gas company, which has also been op
erating an electric plant in this city.
Now the gas company has purchased
claims of water from the North Fork
above the point where the electric com
pany diverts its supply from the s'ream.
Superintendent Decker of the pas com
pany left this morning with a force of
men to dig a ditch to divert the water on
the company's claim. Superintendent
Seymour of the electric company left at
the same time for the mountains, intend
ing to stop Mr. Decker from proceeding
with his work. It appears that the gaa
company purchased a piece of land to get
the water claim. Should it divert the
water the wheels of the new company's
plant would be idle.
RAISIN-SEEDING PLANT.
A New York Man* Invention to Be Put
to Practical V*e.
FRESNO, Cal., July 15.â Work on an
extensive raisin-seeding plant is to be com
menced in this city in a few days, and it
promises to be an important factor for the
welfare of the industry. Colonel William
Forsyth, a prominent raisin-grower and
packer, will supply capital amounting to
$10,000 for a half interest, and the inventor
of a seedinK machine. George Pettit Jr. of
New York, will own the other half interest.
The plant will be located on the railroad
reservation, and will be a three-story frame
structure. It wili have a seeding capacity
of two carloads a day. Pettit has been
operating a seeding factory in New York
with success. He claims to possess the
only practical invention. The seeding of
raisins at nominal cost will undoubtedly
increase the popularity of the product and
increase tne consumption.
A TRAGEDY AT SPOKANE,
Grace' Wilton, a Variety Actress,
Ends Her Life With
Poison.
Known to the San Francisco Talent
as a Living-Picture
Model.
SPOKANE, Wash., July 15.â Grace Wil
ton, a variety actress at the Comique, com
mitted suicide this morning by taking
carbolic acid. She was found by a porter
of Hotel Pedicord, where she was stop
pin?. She had been in this city but a
couple of weeks, coming here from San
Francisco with several others to open the
Comique.
la her room a letter was found, which
shows that a sister wrote for money for
the support of her two little girls, and it
was evident she could not send the money.
While she took the name of Grace Wilton
here, it is learned her father is Maurice
Bernstein, a furniture dealer of San Fran
cisco. The woman's two little girls are
stopping at tbe Brunswick Hotel in San
Francisco.
Grace Wilton was well known in
theatrical circles in San Francisco,
although she played only unimportant
parts at the theaters, and was never em
ployed at the first-class houses except as
an exira girl. She had a beautiful form,
and this fact made Her in great demand
during the living-picture craze. She had
since thken part in such performances in
low-class houses. During the last year
she posed as a model for local photog
raphers.
She waa married to "Jack" Rivers, at
one time a deputy at the City Mall. Her
father, Maurice Bernstein, resides at the
Hotel Brunswick. Mrs. Rivers' two chil
dren, atred about 10 and 6, are with him.
Bernstein was at one time proprietor of
the furniture store in the basement next to
the old St Ignatius Churcn. He failed,
and has not been prominently known as a
merchant since that time. The woman,
who was about 27 years old, has been
known in theatrical circles for many years,
but she was always considered weak
minded.

The free coinage question was brought ]
cr by a member of the dab, and the pres- â 
ident called on F. L. Coombs and G. M.
Francis to speak on the subject. Mr. j
Francis, a .eading Republican of this sec
tion of the State and also a PresiUental '
elector, declared that voters generally i
reeded more knowledge concerning free ;
coinage, an issue made the most of by a ]
desperate Democracy. He said that '
through this club the Republican State ,
Central Committee would distribute the
right kind cf literature. The voice and i
fury of the "Boy Orator of the Platte"
would not be permitted to prevail against
the deliberate and sound reasoning of
sound money advocates. He said a safe
I to bimetallism was that recom
mended by Dr. Arendt, in an article re
cently published in the North American
P.eview to join Germany and France in
aecurins an international double * tandarl.
But for this country to go forward alone to
reform the monetary system of the wor:d
would certainly be a mistake. It would
take us to silver monometallism, ti:e Mex
ican basis.
The money of the wase-eamer and
debtor class would be a depreciated cur
rency, and in this Suite especially the man
owing for his farm or personal property
wouid have to pay a premium for gold in
the liquidating of his indebtedness With
this once understood the wish for inde
pendent free coinage . by silver
xnineoirners, would De checked and the
commerci- and the credit of the
country would rot be wrecked.
In Mr. Francis' opinion ;he coinage ques
tion was not the one in which the people
should be mos: concerned. California had
numberless industries to protect and that
tariff which w&s always enforced when the
Republicans were in power was what we
must return to if we were to have money

HEW CHARTER,

ment Clubs Takes
Action.
AFTER LONG DEBATING.
Opposition to the Sale of the
Geary-Street Railway
Franchise.
WILL BE FOUGHT IN COUET.
A Committee Appointed to Collect
Funds to Pay for Injunction
Proceedings.
Tne San Francisco Association of Im
provement Clubs met last night at B'nai
B'rith Hall. There was a large representa
tive attendance from all parts of the City.
George R. Fletcher of the Richmond Im
provement Club occupied the chair until
James D. Fhelan.the president, arriveJ.
Dr. Rottanzi asked if the meeting was
not a special one to consider the Geary
street franchise. Tbs chair iniormed him
tnat that was not the whole purpce of
tne session. Wnereupon Leon Samuels
presented the following report:
To the President and ilembtrg of the Associated ;
Improvement Clubs of San FrancUco: Your com- i
mittee, to whom was referred the question as to
what course should be pursued by thiÂ« associa- ;
tion in relation to the Geary-street franchise, ,
respectfully submit the following report:
Your committee after a careful examination
of the questions involved in the grant of said
franchise is of the opinion that it is beyond
the power of the Board of supervisors to make
such grant, and that in view of the circum
stances surrounding the attempt to grant such
franchise, the same would be void lor the fol
lowing reasons: -
1. The franchise purports to run for a period
of fifty years from, the date of the issuance
thereof. As a former Board of Supervisors of
this City and County have already granted a
franchise over the same road which will not
expire until about seven years from the pres
ent time, the Board of Supervisors have no
present franchise to grant, and for that rea
son, said franchise would be void.
_. As said contemplated grant is therefore
not the grant of a present right, but the grant
of a right which necessarily takes effect in
the future, and as the same carries no present
interest whatever, the Board of Supervisors
would exceed its powers in granting it ana \
the same would therefore be of no force or
effect.
3. That the terms and conditions upon
which bids are to be made for said mat is an
evasion and violation of the spirit and intent
of the laws under which bids axe made im
perative. An examination of the proposed
bids shows clearly and beyond a doubt that it
is intended to prevent ana stifle competition
and to confine the bidding to the owners of
the preheat franchise or their representatives.
Said proposal provides that the purchaser of
the franchise must b?gnn work within one
year, aud complete the same within three
years from the date of the passage of the or
der. 2
This makes it impossible for any one but the
owners of the present franchise to fulfill the
conditions of the' bid, as such owners alone
are in possession and entitled to the possession
of said road for a period of about seven years
from date, and no one could construct any im
provements in said road, or comply with the
conditions o! said franchise without the con
sent of such owner.
â¢i. That the condition that no bid should be
accepted unless accompanied by the full
amount bid is an unusual, onerous and un
reasonable requirement.
Dr. Rottanzi moved that the report be
received and the subject matter discussed.
AC the consideration of tue Geary
street franchise this tuoiion was carried."
Tne secretary, lsadore Schwartz, read a
report on the abolition of the 'rattier
test" as presented by a special committee.
This report stated that tee red rock ordi
nance and rattier test created an oppres
sive monopoly and ought to be repealed.
The committee had. therefore, prepared
a petition which it held should be siened
bf at least 1000 property-owners. Tnis
petition should be presented to the Super*
visors by at least twenty earnest represen
tative citizens.
It was recommended in the report that
the rattler tart be repealed as to all streets
west of Valencia and Thirteen;.* to Market
street to Van Ness avenue, thence to B*y
street to the bay; also as to all streets
south of Army and Coiosa streets; also
as to all the rocK used in construction of
sidewalks and on the roadway of all
streets less than forty fe*t wide.
L. J. Dwyer moved that the committee
on law and legislation be given power to
receive money to be uÂ«ed in defraying ex
penses of an injunction suit, and a. so to
act in the matter.
Leon Samuels amended, that a special
committee be appointed to collect funds
and that the law and legislation commit
tee be given power to act. The chair ap
pointed George Fletcher, Dr. Sa'fieid and
J. J. McEwen.
â¢The chair was added to the committee.
Discussion of the proposed charter was
then taceu ud. On motion the principal
speakers were limited to n.'teen minutes
each. J. M. Reynolds spoke against the
charter. He said that the charter now
presented was copied a most verbatim
from the charter defeated by the people of
San Francisco in In??.
It was due to his views on municipal
ownership of public utilities that he was
led to study the proposed charter. Under
the present law several cities of California
have obtained their water works or lights,
and are now securing public utilities. He
saw a defect in the new charter in the
provision that the City might own its
public utilities if cheaper than furnished
t>y corporations.
Again, the charter provides that the
votes of nine Supervisors most be bad to
get public ownership instead of eight as at
present.
He thought that the proposed charter
showed its hasty construction in giving
the Mayor almost unlimited power. The
removal of clerks by the Mayor on com
plaint tinder oath "violated civil service
iawa, and he favored civil service. Again,
the charter aid not make any City officials
elective.
F. W. Dohrmana, president of the Mer
chants' Association, said that, in its efforts
to better tne material conditions of San
Francisco, the association bad found in the
charter the desired quality. Any opposi
tion to it came from personal considera
tions, but not one single instance of oppo
sition to the charter as a whole was pre
sented
If the charter be an improvement, as a
whole, over the present law?, the Mer
chants' Association says, "Let's have it."
Mr. Reynolds, sincere as a reformer and a
citizen, was like the rank and â¢Â« file of
objectors to the charter; he objected to
onÂ« featureâ the fact that the new charter
did not provide for municipal ownership
of public utilities.
Daniel Sullivan declared that the char
ter was not framed in the interest of the
people of San Francisco, but it really was
"a gigantic measure formulated by a few
men in the interest of certain interests."
He then asked, as Mr. Dohrmann had
stated that the curse of the City govern
ment was the spoils of : office, what if the
Mayor were corrupt, what could the char
ter then do? Toe charter provided dismissal
of corrupt officials, but not for that of a
corrupt Mayor.
M. H. Hecht stated that the remarks of
the last speaker that the charter's framers
worked . in 1 the interest of anything cor
rutu, was unqualifiedly false.
â  ; He was a frame* â of thÂ» charter an <J
could not say what the complexion of the
framers was, but he asked ihat they be
kept out of further discussion.
A. K. Chase said he was opposed to the
charter. One of his family signed the
Declaration of Independence and they
were aii Americans. Three members of
his family were schoolteachers and the
charter provided tnat only those' educated
in the public school system of California
would be entitled to teach in the schools
of San Francisco.
Mr. liecht explained the clause regard
ins? the education of teachers in tne public
school system of California. He stated
that the board of freeholders had been
urged to incorporate the clause. In the
past School Directors had given impecun
ious relatives from ail parts of the United
States positions in the schools and the cry
went up fro;a people at home.
A man told him: ''I won't Tote for
your charter. There's one thing in it I
cant support.'
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Hecht, "I
helped to frame the charter, and there are
twenty thinzs in it that I don't like."
HeaJy delivered a heated address which
stirred the hor.se. He held that tne
trouble with the charter was it favored
corporate interests.
Judge Van Reynegom remarked that
there was considerable misunderstanding
regarding the clause referring to public
schools. This, lite the rest of the char
ter, hÂ« said, was subject to the general
laws of the State and. consequently, it
was* very much exaggerated in importance.
Cuthbertson, the architect, spoke aeainst
the proposed charter. E. P. Van Duzer
replied, and showed that the appointive
power given the Mayor by tne new char
ter was desirable in View of present condi
tions.
Mr. Freud closed the debate in fayor of
the charter. In his speech be said:
First objectionâ lt is claimed that the char
ter is too ion;.
Answerâ Tne charter contains 212 pages of
an ordinary phamphiet in lance type. The
consolidation act comprises 462 pages of a
ph&mphlet the same size, but much smaller
type.
second objectionâ It is claimed that no de
sirable charter could be framed within Uiixty
days without fatal and serious defects.
Answerâ The framers of the charter were
limited to ninety days by the constitution of
the State, and out of ninety days nearly sixty
days were used in determining tie validity of
the charter convention. The thirty aays re
maining would be too short a time in which to
create a new charter. It must, however, not be
forgotten that the fnuners of this cnarter had
the benefit of the three preceding charters, as
well as drafts of two specially prepared. So
that, it is tree, the charter as now submitted is
not a new creation, but in reality a revision of
the excellent wort of these preparatory ef
fort*. This account* for the preparation of
this present charter in so brief a time without
having any serious or fatal defects, as have
been charged.
Third objectionâ The opponents of the char
ter claim teat it will make the Mayor a muni
cipal dictator
Answerâ a careful examination of the pro
visions of the charter will clearly show that
this claim is without foundation. As soon as
the charter goes into effect the Mayor will ap
point the City Attorney, Public Administrator.
Board of Public Works, Park Commissioners,
library Trustees, Police Commissioners, Fire
Commissioners, Botrd of Health, Election
Commissioners and Civil Service Commis
sioners. All other officials ot the city will re
main elective under the constitution and gen
eral laws of the State. Until such time as the
constitution shall have been changed by the
people, all other officials will therefore be
elected by the people as heretofore, with the
exception of the Superintendent of Streets and i
Surveyor, who are abolished under the charter. j
Examining. therefore, the list of appointments i
by the Mayor, it will readily appear that the I
Mayor, under the charter, will appoint i
but two officials who are at MMM
elected by the pcoole. These two officials are
the City Attorney and the Public Adminis
trator. All the other Commissioners and Trus
tees appointed by the Mayor are now either
appointed by the Governor or hold office for
DM or are newly created. Therefore, the
people will not be deprived ot their privilege i
of electing official; as at present, except in the
case of the Cut Attorney and Public Adminis
â  trator. While the Mayor who is in office when
the charter goes into effect will appoint all
these Commissioners, subsequent Mayors will
appoint but two of them, as they go out of
office in rotation and the term of the Mayor v
limited to two years.
Fourth objectionâ la claimed by those who
: have superficially read Albert Shaw's works
upon "Municipal government in. Great Britain"
and on the continent of Europe that the idea
of selecting a Mayor instead of a Council at the
, bead of a city government is erroneous, and
should not be done in the cue of San Fran
! Cisco. -
Answerâ Th!s conclusion is not based upon a
I thorough study of the works of Albert Shaw
I nor any other prominent writer upon munici-
I pal government. Albert Shaw himself, in the
! preface of his work upon "Municipal Govern
ment in Great Britain," page 7. says: "I have
j do intention to prescribe European remedies
! for American maladies, nor to suggest any de
j gree whatsoever of imitation. We mu*t deal
â¢ with our own problems in cur own way.** It is
i therefore clear that Albert Shaw himself would
; not recommend the adoption of a system of
; government that our forefathers had aban
! doned.
Professor Edmund J. James of the University
I of Pennsylvania tut- the case clearly in the
| fallowing words of his excellent address upon
â¢The Elements of a Model Charter for Ameri
can Citi-s"':
"Ho European city of large size has anything I
like the same proofed." to solve on the politi
cal sice of its administration as our own cities ;
; and while the objects to be attainedâweU
| paved streets, of good water, of good light, of
i sanitary conditions In general â are the same.
I the obstacles in the way of securing - these
things in the two contiaents are at many
points of a radically different character.' No
one could have studied the actual method of
administration of English and German cities
Srithout being struck by the fact that it is
based en government by committees, a system
i which inherited by oar American common
wealths from England broke down absolutely
and completely under the stress of modern
political developments in the United States.
The form of government under which Dublin
and London and Berlin are well administered
has proven itself an absolute failure in our
larger American cities."
Fifth objectionâ lt is claimed by the op
; ponents ot the charter that it i& fatally defect
; ive because it dues not provide any means by
which the Mayor and some other City officials
can get into office. . â¢â . .â¢
Answerâ lt would be wholly superfluous for
I the charter to make any such provision. The
! election of these officials Is provided for under
j the constitution and general laws of the State.
The charter will not supplant the constitution
or any general laws of the State, or any special
laws that are no: inconsistent with it. As the
; charter allows these officials to be elected,
| they will continue to be elected as heretofore.
Sixth objectionâ The opponents of the char
ter claim that it is unconstitutional because in
some of its crovtsions it may prove to be In
consistent with the constitution and general
laws of the Bute.
Answerâ No human law la perfect. If any
particular provision of the new charter shall
turn out to be unconstitutional It will be only
, following the natural course of othet organic
: laws. The constitution of the United state*
; and the constitution of California were both.
j found necessary to be changed by subsequent
i action of the people.
Seventh objectionâ The opponents of the
charter claim that it will bÂ« an impediment to
municipal ownership of public utilities.
Answer â An. examination of the three pro
visions in the charter bearing upon this sub
ject clearly show teat vats is not the case.
Ample provisions are mads for acquiring pab-
Eizhth objectionâ Is is claimed by the op
ponents of me charter that all the desirable
features of the charter already exist in the
sututes governing this City . .
Answerâ The best and quickest answer to
this question is to ask these opponents of the
charier to point out wherein the peeaent con
solidation act provides for any civil service
1 wit a its inestimable blessings? Where is there
j any provision in the present consolidation act
I for a safe and rigid system of finance and
revenue ? Where ia the consolidation act are
. these many strong and beneficial restrictions
upon public franchise* that exist in the
1 new charter ? Where in the consolidation
act are there any safe laws â¢â¢ govern
ing elections aud registration of voters !
i here does the consolidation act provide for
I any. home rule or municipal sovereignty?
" nere are there any provisions In the present
consolidation act that win lead to the proper
construction ox great public works? It would
be possible in this way to ask 100 times more
lor beneficial pro visions that exist in the new
charter, and that cannot be found in the pres
ent laws governing San Francisco. *^

EZETA SCENTS A PLOT,
The General Marvels at the Atti
tude of the Consul, Dr.
Calderon.
Jiminez Will Be Examined on the
Charge of Assault With a
Deadly Weapon.
â¢'The papers said a lady took me to the
City Hail," complained Don Carlos Ezeta,
yesterday. The general was in the best of
spirits, considering his recent cio9e shave,
and was sitting in his apartments at the
Marechai Niel talking over the affair with
the gentleman friend who had accom
panied him to the edifice which Castilians
euphoniously style the "Palacio Muni
cipal."
The case came up before Police Judge
Campbell yesterday mornine, ex-Judge
Sullivan representinz .Pedro Jiminez, the
general's assailant. Don Carlos was not
present. On motion of Mr. Sullivan the
preliminary examination wis postponed
until next Tuesday. Prosecuting Attor
ney Forbes moved that the minor cnarge
of carrying a concealed weapon, upon
which Jiminez was first arrested, be dis
missed, and it was so ordered. The young
man wilt now have to answer the accusa
tion of assault with a deadly weapon.
Meanwhile the affair is creating no small
stir ia Spanish- American circles. The
Marechai Niel has been beseiged by
visitors, but those seeking Jiminez were
doomed to disappointment. The young
fellow has retired from view temporarily,
and indications are that the same roof
will no longer shelter the ruler and sub
ject of other days. General Ezeta, while
by no means blind to the humorous side
of the aiiair, is convinced that it. has its
serious aspect.
"Of course," he observed in commenting
upon the case, "every one knows I can
have no personal fear of poor Jiminez.
But wdv should an unknown stripling
threaten my life? Why does he now
keep out of everybody's way? The alle
gation on his part that I have injured him
is bosh, and he knows it. No one knows
better than he that he was a mere tool.
And then the question suggests itself to
my mindâ for whom was hfe acting as a
tool?
"This question fills me with suspicions
of a plot. The manner in which Dr. Eus
torjio Calderon, present Consul of Salva
dor, has mixed in the affair would seem,
to say the least, peculiar. He interested
himself witn ardor in Jiminez's release
from custody and when he had got
him out of jail took the boy to the Maison
Tortoni, where he wined and dined him,
after which he took him to the theater as
though to celebrate the event. To-day
Dr. caideron came here to the hotel and
had a lengthy interview with his pro
tege. I, a citizen and former Presi
dent of Salvador, a general in
the army of the republic, and a
compatriot whose life had been for sev
eral minutes at a cravens mercy, was
completely ignored by the representative
of my Government. Of course, I do not
hanker alter any personal relations with
Dr. Calderon, but there is such a thing as
official decency.
â¢â¢To the dickens with the whole busi
ness!" exclaimed the general in conclu
sion, or words to that effect, in the
sonorous Spanish tongue, "lam tired and
disgusted with it all. Oae woula think
all who had a hand in so cowardly, so
abortive and so utterly miserable a trans
action ought to De ashamed of themselves;
but no, they seem by their antics to imag
ine that they have done something
BUILDERS OH A STRIKE,
A Walk-Out on a Job on Four
teenth and Valencia
Streets.
Ten or more carpenters went out on a
strice on James Smiley's big building job
on Fourteenth and Valencia streets yes
terday morning.
The trouble was caused by the presence
of several non-union lathers wno went to
work in the morning. Several days ago
these lathers appeared aad the union men
ceased work, but as the building was not
ready for the lathers the latter departed
and the union men returned to their
places. It was plainly stated that if the
ontractor put non-union men to work
he others would quit, and they kept their
promise.
There was one man who refused to
strice, Aaron Perry by name, who is a
member of the Oakland Carpenters'
Union.
The metal-roofers joined the carpenters
in the waik-out and many unpleasant
things were said of Ferry for refusing to
strike. Caarges of violating the union
rales were preferred against him at the
meeting of the District Council last night.
The business agents of the Building
Trades' Council hope to settle the matter
with the contractor to-day so that the
work may be done by onion men. If the
lathing is finished by the non-union
lathers no union man will be allowed to
complete the buildings even after the
lathers hare departed.
At the meeting of the District Council
of Carpenters the following officers were
elected: President. F. M. Thompson;
vice-president, Joseph Leet secretary, R.
B. Ingle; treasurer, C. Page; warden, J.
Bershaw.
The council has received $100 for the
strike fund from the International Union,
and $100 more is on the way here.

Dr. A. T. Smdatâ DKJJtStx: The Beit vhlth
Iboo^ht from you some time ago has cared
me. My disease was seminal weakness of five
years' â¢tandiag. I had emissions on an aver-
age of aye times a week, and maay antes three
in one night. I used all kinds of drags aad
patent medicines, and was, when I begaa your
treatment, ia a very weak condition, both
from my trouble and the many different drags
I had taken. As soon as I applied your Belt I
foaad relief from my losses, in three weeks a
ireneral improved condition, and I am now en-
tirely cured. I cannot say too much in praise
oi your Beit. Yours truly, J. M. HUEBAP.D.
No man can attain physical or muscular
perfection while there is any want of vital
j force. It is the grit, the vim. the "ginger"
which supports the powers of endurance,
and the command of â  latent physical
streagth.-
Every mao knows himself. He knows
where he ia weak. Knowing i:, if he is
true to himself, he will try to recover the
vital power he has wastei. .
The source of all physical power is in
the nerves. The life of the nerves is elec-
tricity. So says science. Man, if you lack
any of the elements of manhood, will you
barter you; future happiness any further
by letting this chance pass? Be one of
the progressive men. Perfect your man-
hood, physically, sexually, mentally.
"A great change has come over me, and I

Leading Democrats Re

VIEWS OF LYMAN GAGE, THE GREAT
BANKER, ON SILVER.

ness Men Showing How Silver Salaries
Rob the Laborer.
I realise It is not the individual so much hk it is the principles he la to carry out,
and my vote trill go to McKinley even if I am a Virginian and have heretofore
been a Democrat. â Dr. H. K. Bell.
The platform adopted by the Democratic Convention at Chicago, -with its anar
chistic, BocialiÂ«tic and silver planks, ia not at all in accordance with my ideas of a
Government which can be beneficial to the people. I have been a Democrat, but I
will cast my ballot for McKlnley and the principles which are advanced in the
platform adopted at the Republican Convention at St. Louis.â Sigmund Greene-
Damn.
One hundred and six bankers have responded to the request of the California
Bankers' Association for a statement of their views on the money question. One
hundred and three favor a single standard.
I never dreamed that the time would come when I would vote the Republican
ticket, yet this year X will vote for William McKinley. R. M. WELCH,
San Praneisco Savings Union.
It has been an aggravating paradox to us why California, which has main
tained a gold standard through all currency vicissitudes, should favor free
silver. LYMAX J. GAGK,
President First National Bank, Chicago.
Prominent Democrats are responding to
the McKinley sound-money roiicall daily.
The bankers of the State are a unit and
representative Democrats from all lines of j
business are giving public expression to
their opposition to the Chicago platform.
Nearly all who go this far do not stop
short of the declaration that they will
vote for the Republican candidate and a
gold standard.
For a Safe Currency.
The bankers of California have spoken
on t: c monetary question. In no uncer
tain tones they have given their views of
what constitutes a sate currency system
for this country, and the unanimity of
their verdict for the policy advocated by
the Republican National platform is so
marked that even the local bankers, who
are enthusiastic in their adherence to the
gold standard, were surprised.
A few weeks ago the executive commit
tee of the California Bankers' Association
passed a strong resolution on the money
question. The committee, speaking for
the association, declared its unqualified
opposition to free coinage or any other 16 to
1 proposition, and called upon the bankers
of the State to seize every available oppor
tunity to explain the fallacy of the silver
theory and to labor for the adoption of a
sound monetary policy in this country.
These resolutions were embodied In a
circular which was sent to every bank in
the State, and to a few prominent banking
institutions in other parts of the country.
Accompanying each circular was a postal
card addressed to the officers of the bank
asking if the sentiments expressed in the
resolutions met their approval. To these
cards 106 answers liave been received from
banics in California. Of these 103 heartily
indorse the resolutions. One dodges the
issue by saying it is a question upon
which there is a division of opinion, and
two, the Bank of Central California and
the Petaluma Savings Bank, refuse to in
dorse the resolutions.
Answers were received from a few of the
communications addressed to Eastern in
stitutions, though these were not expected |
to respond. The object of the Bankers'
Association was to feel the puise of the
California business men, whose interests
they believe are voiced by the banters.
They also wished to show financiers of
other parts of the country that California
had been to some extent misrepresented,
and that there was in this State a large
element decidedly in favor of a gold stan
dard.
Interesting responses were also received
from other Slates of the Pacific Slope. For
instance, Ladd & Tilton, tue most promi
nent banking establishment of Port
land, Oregon, write: "We heartily
accord in the action of your executive
committee as expressed in a circular of
May 25, 1896. The late election does not
state Oregon'! position on the money
question. It was more Mitchell and a de
sire to throw off a certain controlling ele
ment in the Republican party."
Answers in a similar strain were re
ceived from the Citizens' National Bank of
Tacoma, Washington National Bank of
Tacoma and the National Bank ol Seattle.
These all expressed the opinion that the
Northwest, if tne matter was put to the
test, would vote by a iarge majority to
sustain the single standard.
One of the most interesting communica
tions received was from Lyman J. Gage,
one of the foremost financiers of the age.
Mr. Gage is president of the First National
Bank oi Chicago, an institution having
$30.000, 000 assets, a most remarkable show
ing for a commercial bank. Ga^e writes:
Chicago, 111., July 1, 1896.
R. M. Welch. Secretary California Bankers' At
tociationâDear Sir : lam much gratified with
the expression maue by the California Bank
ers' Association on the money question. It
has beeu an aggravating paradox to us that
California, where the sold standard has been
maintained through all currency vicissitudes,
shoula side up with the advocates of repudi
ation and dishonor. L. J. Gage,
President First National Bank of Chicago.
P. C. Miller, of the United States Na
tional Bank of Portland, Or., was emphatic
in his indorsement of the resolution. "The
resolution, as passed by the California
Bankers' Association," he writes, "covers
the situation in a very comprehensive
manner, and will be indorsed, I believe,
by every banker in Oregon. If Oregon
was to vote ut)on the proposition to-day
there would be a substantial majority for
the gold standard."
The great mass of responses were from
California bankers. Of these alone there
were 106, and as previously stated ail but
three were in favor of the gold standard.
In the majority of instances the largest
banks throughout the State contented
themselves with merely indorsing the
committee's action in emphatic terms.
Such expressions as ' Yea, heartily," "We
emphatically approve," 'â¢Action of com
mittee indorsed," "We entirely agree with
yÂ° u >' "Ow directors are opposed to free
silver," etc., were the answers sent by
many of the banks.
Many of the presidents and cashiers who
responded, however, felt that the question
called for more extended expressions of
Â» ir ri vleW! - M- J- Daniels, president of
the Orange-erowers' Bank of Riverside,
answered in the following vigorous man
ner: "It has my most emphatic indorse
mert. If there is any State in the Union
that should indorse the gold standard it
should beCalilomia.whichisknown as the
Gold State."
The directors of the Citizens' Bank of
Anaheim indorse the resolution, but state
that it is their belief the Government
should use its best efforts with foreign
countries so that the silver coin could be
placed in more general circulation. This,
they believe, would result in increased
prosperity for the country.
D. H. Snodgrass of the Bank of Selma
expresses gratification at the action of
the committee, and states the directors
of the institution he represents are heartily
in favor of the single standard. "Let the
work of education on the financial ques
tion go on," he says. "The brains of the
country are already on the right side."
P. M. Maylor of Berkeley, af ier approv
ing of the resolution, expressed the opinion
that we are using more silver now than
would be used on a free silver basis.
From Los Angeles banks were received
hearty indorsements of the resolution.
The First National Bank of that place
urges that the wrone impression of the
sentiment of the business men on this
question be as effectively as possible cor
rected.
David Henderson of the Santa Clara
ValJey Bank declared himself and the
directors he represented heartily in favor
of the resolution. He expressed surprise
that any thineing man could for a mo
ment indorse the sentiments of the free
silver advocates and urged upon the Cali
fornia Bankers' Association that it con
tinue to vigorously combat the ignorance
and error which is seeking to destroy the
Nation's credit.
Of course the Ban Francisco. Oakland,
San Jose and Sacramento bank* responded
emphatically in favor of a single standard
that is recognized by international trade.
It was the smaller banks that are more
directly in touch with the farmers and the
fruit-raisers whose opinions the commit
tee awaited most anxiously, and now that
they have sent in their replies with such
emphatic and unanimous approval of the
stand set forth in the resolutions, local
bankers feel reassured and declare that so
far as this State is concerned there can be
little doubt that McKinley and sound
money will prevail.
J. R. Henifr.
"I gness I am one of those you are look-
Ing for," said J. R. Henify, agent for some
of the largest lumber companies on the
coast and in the East, when addressed by
a Call representative who had been on an
active hunt for Democrats who are op
posed to the silver policy. "I cannot say
that I am scientifically posted on this
question, but as a Democrat I hold to the
belief that whatever entails hardship and
suffering on the creat masses of the people
cannot be a sound Democratic policy. As 1
said 1 pretend to no scientific knowledge
of the question, but I recall several inci
dents in my own commercial experience
which seem to illustrate most effectively
the evil results which would follow the
free coinage of silver in this country.
Wh9ii I was working for a large lumber
firm here several years ago complicated
gold and silver conditions prevailed.
"The head of the firm used to go out and
buy silver from the brokers with which to
pay the drafts of the lumbermen from the
woods and all our other employes, and we
saved enough monthly to defray the ex
penses of the office. That is to say, the
workingmen in the mills and in the yards
lost enough on their silver wages to pay
the salaries of four or five high-priced
clerks and other office expenses. My
father also had a tough experience with
silver when he came out here, some time
before the date of the incident first referred
to, with a lot of greenbacks. My experi
ence leads me to believe that any money
policy that causes the poor man to suffer
loss and beir the burden of the evil is
iniquitous. lam a Democrat and always
have voted my party ticket, but I am go
ing to cast my ballot for McKinley and
sound money this time."
B. C. Cuvellier.
This gentleman manages the large
wholesale wine and importing business of
Mr. de Finnery, and has always voted the
Democratic ticket.
"Yes, sir; lam atrainst silver," he said,
"and if you quote me I wish you would
say I shall vote for McKinley. I have
always voted the Democratic National
ticket, though independent in local poli
tics some times. This time, though, it is
a bitter pill for me to swallow to have to
vote for McKinley, the representative and
high priest of protection, which I do not
believe in. Still, he is now the representa
tive of a sound money policy, and I believe
it ia to the best interests of the country
that we should have a cold standard. I
shall either vote for McKinley or not vote
at all, and certainly not for the National
Democratic ticket, which is for silver, and
that means dishonor and disaster for our
country. lam a patriot oefore a partisan,
and I know you will find hundreds who
think as I do."
Dr. H. It. Bell.
"I am no politician in the strict accepta
tion of the word," said Dr. H. R. Bell. "I
am a Virginian, and I suppose my old
father would tar and feather me if he
heard me express myself in this way: I
will vote for McKinley this time because I
believe he is the best man to govern our
country. The best men, so far as I can
see, are with him and the platform on
which he stands. lam not a radical in
my political ideas. I want the best man
this country can select to take the helm,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1896.
whether he be a Democrat or a Republican.
I realize it is not the individual so much
as it is the principles he is to carry out,
and my vote will go to McKinley even if I
am a Virginian and have heretofore been
a Democrat.
"I have learned that our banks do not
care to open up new accounts on the basis
of free silver. They do not want our
money because they cannot us" it to ad
vantage. That is a deplorable case of
standstill."
R. M. Welch.
R. M. Welch of the San Francisco Sav
ings Union has just joined the army of
erstwhile Democrats who are unable to
swallow the Chicago platform and the
radical principles enunciated by the Ne
braska prodigy.
"I have been a Democrat all my life,"
he declared yesterday, ''and my fore
fathers were Democrats. I am of South
ern stock, and I never dreamed that the
time would come when I would vote tne
Republican ticket. Yet this year 1 will
vote for William McKinley. T"he question
is too important to be influenced by parti
san associations, and I cannot vote for
free silver.
"11 the laboring man could only under
stand this question he would see that in
free silver lies his ruin. Commodities of
all kinds will rise with the adoption of a
free-jilver law and the wages of the
laborer will be the last thing to respond.
He will find himself compelled to pay a
great deal more for everything he pur
chases and he will receive very little, if
any, more compensation.
The necessity of a single standard is a
proposition upon which business men are
practically united. The City is full of
life-long Democrats who will this year
support the Republican ticket for the first
time. In tbia bank alone there are four
men. to my knowledge, who will leave the
Democratic party to vote for McKinley."
SiKmund Greenobanm.
"I have been, but 1 am no longer a
Democrat."
This assertion, from snch an important
and influential person as Sigmund Greene
baum, manager of the London, Paris and
American Bank, can hardly be passed
over lightly.
"The platform adopted by the Demo
cratic Convention at Chicago, with its
anarchistic, socialistic and silver planks,
is not at all in accordance with my ideas
of a Government which can be beneficial
to the people.
"I will certainly not vote for Bryan and
Bewail, and 1 will cast my bailot for Mc-
Kinley and the principles which are ad
vanced in the platform adopted at the
Republican Convention in St. Louis."
S. L. Everett.
8. L. Everett, the editor of Pacific Wood,
Iron and Coal, has always borne an envi
able reputation as a sound political thinker
and writer, and has ever been identified
w'.tn the Democratic party. He is a Demo
crat yet, but when asked whether hecouid
support the Chicago platform lie raised
his hands in comical deprecation, saying:
"Now, go way. You are a newspaper man
and so am I, and you ought to know better
than to interview me. After a little
parley be readily admitted that he could
not stand on his party's silver plank, and
proceeded : "I don't know any Democrats
that can. Certainly there are none of my
acquaintance. I was talking with five old
warhorses at the foot of the stnirs this
morning and they one and all expressed
the determination to vote for sound money.
Free coinage is an idiotic policy. It means
commercial disaster â it is the synonym
for ruination. Arguments are useless if
the man who runs cannot read the pro
phetic writing on the political walls of
the timeÃ."
WAS A CASE OF SUICIDE,
The Mystery Surrounding George
W. Wallis' Death Ex
plained.
He Was 111 and Despondent so He De
cided to End His
Life.
George W. White.alias George W. WaUis,
the man found dead in his bed at the Russ
House Tuesday evening, committed sui
cide, and yesterday morning James A.
Kemp, a son-in-law of the deceased, living
at Sacramento, received a watch from
Wallis. and, suspecting something wrone,
hurried to the City. At the Morgue he
found a letter, reading as follows:
San Francisco, July 13, 1896.
Dear Jim and Nellie and Atidry : I hope these
few lines will find you all weli. lam not feel
ing at all well. I am down in the mouth
very much soâ for I don' t Bee anything before
me but that when my money is gone I stall
have to go to the poorhouse, but I don't intend
I will ever do that. I did intend when I left
your house last Wednesday to return on Satur
day or Sunday night, but I changed my mind
also about going to Arizona. I have made
up my mind thai ] will not be dependent on
any. if I can help it. Death before dishonor
and the sooner I am dead, I think, the Detier
it will be for me. For fear I may do some rash
action, I have expressed my watch to you by
Wells, Fargo <fc Co., for fear some one ml ht
steal it from me. It is not very valuable, but
it is the best I had to send you; and about the
trunk, there are some books and some like
nesses In it that 1 would like for Audry to
keep; and there are somethings in it which
Nellie might like, and I would like for Audry

dear Audry, I would like for you to take great
care of your grandpa's sisters' pictures, and
divide some of the others with Aunt Nellie if
she would like any of them, and I hope
that you will be a good girl and try to

Uncle Jim wish, and never swear nor tell
stories and try to learn all you can, and then
you will grow up to be a good woman, and
write to the boys often. So now I must bid you
good-by. I wish you was here to give me a

WHO WASHED MRS.
HASKINS' CLOTHES?.
The Exciting Question
Again Creates
Trouble.
MITCHELL WAS CURIOUS
Important as the Identity of the
Man Who Struck Billy
Patterson.
ONE SIDE QUITS, POUTING.
Refuses to Go On Until the Name of
the Washerwoman Is Made
Known.
Mrs. Elizabeth Haskins, an impor
tant figure in the contention over the
pencil will of James G. Fair, was under
examination nearly all day yesterday
before Notary Latham in John E. Richards'
office.
Garret McEnerney and R. B. Mitchell
asked most of the questions, and Mrs.
Haskins, old lady that she is, answered
and answered and answered in most im
perturbable, unruffled and apparently un
wearied fashion hour after hour.
The end of the morning session was en
livened by a little bout between the attor
neys, Mr. Mitchell insisting upon having
his questions relative to Mrs. Haskins'
income and the name and residence of her
laundress answered. Mrs. Haskins, ap
parently quite willing to give the informa
tion, was advised by Mr. Delmas not to
answer.
Mitchell and McEnerney declared that
the questions were proper and relevant,
and flatly declared that they would refuse
to go on with the inquiry unless the wit
ness answered them. Under Deltnas' ad
vice Mrs. Haskins still refused, and
Delmas, first having the notary put the
question to the attorneys on the other sids
as to whether or not they I. ad finished, j
proceeded with the taking of the deposi- |
tion.
Mitchell and McEnerney called upon the
notary to make a certificate of the ques
tions objected to for suomission to the
court.
The proceedings beean in the morning
by a reference to the meeting between
Mrs. Haskins and the attorneys for the
Fair children. The witness was calU-d
upon to relate in detail the interview be
tween herself and Mr. Wheeler at the
time Mrs Craven returned from New York
with the pencil will. This involved the
retelling of the story as given by Mrs.
Haskins in her direct examination the day
before, for she told Wheeler only what j
she told Delmas in answes to his ques- {
tions. She related at length her search
for the pad upon which the will was
written, how she found it in what she
called her "tank room," and of the little
sliver of paper that fitted to tne torn cor
ner of the will itself; of Mr. Lloyd's ereat
Joy thereat and of his explaining that this
would prove invaluable in case anybody
else attempted to ring in a fraudulent will.
This was all in answer to questions put by
Mr. McEnerney.
Mr. Mitchell took the witness, and after
a long excursion over the well-worn paths
began to trench upon new territory.
"Can you tell us, Mrs. Haskins." he
said, "wny Mrs. Craven employed Eazene
Deuprey to look after your interests in the
matter of the contest of your husband's ;
will? She did do that, did she not?"
'â¢Yes, sir; she did."
"Why? You had already engaged your
own counsel."
"She did not think Mr. Wright gifted
for tne work."
"You did not make the suggestion your
self?"
"No, sir."
"Mrs. Craven was not to receive any.
thing in the matter?"
"No, sir.'
"She was not a legatee under the will?"
"No, sir."
"Now, Mrs. Haskins, did you not tell
Mr. Jonas, one of the persons whom you
namad yesterday as being a resident under
your roof, that Mrs. Craven had you under
her feet?"
"No living man or woman could keep
me under their feet"
"That is not the question. Did you not
make that remark to Mr. Jonas?"
"No, sir; I did not."
"You purchased the tictcet for Mrs.
Craven when she went East, I under
stand 1"'
"Yes, sir."
"Did Mrs. Craven ask you to do so?"
"No, sir."
"It was simply a voluntary bit of kind
ness on your part?"
"I thought Mrs. Craven did not have
any too much money."
"You took the ticket from the agent and
banded it to Mrs. Craven V"
"Yes, sir, and also a receipt."
"Are you in the habit of exacting a re
ceipt when you buy railroad tickets?"
"I always get a receipt when I make
purchases."
"We should like to have you produce
that receipt if you have it, Mrs. Haskins."
The witness said she would produce it if
it could be found.
"Have you not made a will bequeathing
your estate to Margaret Craven?"
"No, sir."
"You have frequently given Mrs. Craven
money?"
''I have aided her at times â her and her
daughter. 1 '
"You are very fond of her daughter?"
"Yes, sir."
Mr. Mitchell then began to inquire as to
Mrs. Haskins' financial status and income,
whereupon Mr. Delmas promptly inter
fered and advised the witness not to an
swer- Another reference was also ma>le to
the laundering in iue Haskins house,
which was also promptly checked in the
same way.
"These questions we consider important
and relevant and are to be followed by
others along the same line," said Mitchell,
"and if they are not to be answered we
will move that this matter be continued
until we can get a hearing of the court
upon them."
"We will proceed with the taking of this
deposition if you are through putting
your questions," said Mr. Deimas. "We
do not think that the refusal of the wit
ness to answer questions having no bear
ing upon the matter in hand and which
touch upon her own private affairs is suffi
cient to postpone the taking of this depo
sition."
Mitchell and McEnerney put their heads
together and after a moment's conference
decided to ask no more questions if the
notary would decide that the inquiry
should go on.
Mr. Latham confessed that he was in a
very embarrassing position, as no such
momentous question had ever arisen with
in his experience. He decided, however,
to give theobjectuig attorneysa certificate
of the unanswered questions to the court
and to allow Mr. Delmas to continue his
questions.
In answer to Mr. Delmas the witness
stated that Mr. Wright, her attorney, had
told her that Mr. Wheeler had promised

HIS VICTIMS ARE MANY
Ransom Ellenwood, Forger and
Swindler, Arrested by
One of Them.
For Four or Five Weeks He Has
Been Doing a Big Business in
Worthless Checks.
Ransom Ellenwood, the man who has
been doing a land-office business among
hotels and boarding houses by means of
worthless checks for the past lour or five
weeks, was arrested last night.
One of his many victims waa F. L. Tur
pin, proprietor of the Royal House, 126
Ellis street. He had a room there for a
lew days and "beat" Tnrpin out of $10 for
room rent and $28 50 which was advanced
.to him on a bogus check lor $125 on Wells-
Fargo'a Bank.
Last night A. W. Turpin, manager of
the hotel, met Ellenwood on Ellis street.
He took him m charge till he met Police
man E. Ring and the officer escorted him
to the City Prison, where he was booked
on the charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses.
This morning fifteen or sixteen more
charges will be registered against Ellen
wood. One of them will be a charge of
forgery, as Detective Ross Whittier has a
forged check in his possession which Ellen
wood passed.
Nt-arly all of the detectives here have
been on the outlook for Ellenwood, each
having in his possession one or two of the
worthless checks, which were all drawn
upon Well-Fargo's Bank. Complaints to
police headquarters had been so numer
ous thatLhief Crowley had given per
emptory instructions that the swindler
had to be captured as speedily as possible,
and last night he was very much pleased
to learn that he was behind the bars.
Ellenwood is the man who succeeded in
getting Justice of the Peace Carroll to
guarantee a Doeus check for $100, which
he had cashed "by Barney Schreiber, the
horse-owner.
His modus operandi was the same in all
(he hotels and boarding-houses as at the
Royal House, with the exception that
when the etieck was small he got the full
difference between his debt for board and
lodging and the amount of the check.
Elienwood is 26 years of age and gives
his occupation as a bookkeeper. On July
11, 1890. he was sent to San Quentin for
two years for forgery.

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
KI.KCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Another bond issue is threatened.
Qrover is still in office.
We hear much of Bryan's tongue but
very little of his brains.
Bryan may capture the Populist horse at
St. Louis, but can he ride him?
Bryan talks through a hat of very soft
feit without any particular shape.
Ask your Republican friends if they
have registered, and keep at them until
they do.
McKinley is the man for the masses for
he stands for their welfare and champions
their wages.
Cleveland has the satisfaction of know
ing that no one objects to his fishing trips
this summer.
Every business man should register, for
the votes of all will be needed to defeat
the agitators.
A vote for woman suffrage would be a
vote to strengthen the cause of protection
to home industry.
It is worth while remembering that the
Democrats nominated Cleveland on a bi
metallic platform.
Bryan has always been a promising
3-oung man, but we have never heard of
his fulfilling a promise.
Democracy in the East will have to rely
on chin music this year. All the big or
gans have quit grinding.
Only a little while ago the free-traders
declared thai protection is dead and now
they are trying to dodge it.
Don't be surprised to see many Southern
States vote for McKinley. Business sense
in that section is growing fast.
Unless you support the business inter
ests oi the country there will never be
business enough to support you.
Campaign songs may touch on many
tbemes, but the popular chorns will be
alway? McKinley and protection.
Tbe first thought of many silver men
may be for Bryan, but the sober second
thought will turn them to McKinley.
While Democrats talk Republicans are
organizing. The one cares only for oratory
while the otner is working for business.
Free-traders are showing thinly in the
face of Bill McKinley. They have all
taken to lyin' and are trying to dodge with
Bryan.
If Hoke Smith and Sterling Morton de
cide to bolt, let us hope they will bead for
Europe and not mix things up in this
country.
It is about time for the Democrats to
explain why the great Silver Champion
Bland was turned down for a blatherskite
boy orator.
It will be a campaign of education for
Bryan as well as for the people, but the
young man will not get his biggest lesson
until election day.
Tbe Republican money plank is broad
enough for all bimetailists, but the Demo
cratic plank is too narrow for any but a
j-ilver monometallist.
Cleveland had better spend the summer
hunting for a pood deep hole into which
he can retire after next March and escape
the derision of the country.
There will be no more trouble with the
pold reserve when we have a Republican
tariff to yield revenues and Republican
statesmen to manage them.
In seeking to elect Bryan by arraying
one c!ass against another, tbe Democrats
overlook the fact that there are no such
things as classes in America.
Bimetallism in the hands of statesmen
would be a benefit to the country, but in
the hands of reckless or ignorant men it
would lead to disaster aud prove a curu to
all.
Tbe cause of woman suffrage must not
be overlooked during the campaign. Let
it be remembered on every stump during
the canvass and by ail the people on elec
tion day.
This is a contest between tbe business
interests of the country and the agitators
who s-eek to disturb business, and every
man who seeks prosperity mast vote the
Republican ticket.
Tne Republican party is pledged to pro
mote international bimetallism, and in
that pledge the people have confidence,
for they know the Republican party has
never broken its pledges.
THE SOBER SECOND THOUGHT.
It is the sober second thought of the
American people that eives liberty, justice
and richt their sure foundation. It is the
sober second thought of the people that
separates partisan politics from patriot
ism and holds the Nation aloof from the
influence of passing waves of fanaticism,
aud it is the sober second thought of the
people that weighs and measures propo
sitions for departure from principles
of government wi.ich have raised a few
sparsely settled colonies into a mighty
nation. It is the sober second thought of
the people that â wiil beat back and destroy
the hosts of Altgeldism that are now pre
paring to make onslaught upon the fruits
of the victories of the war of revolution and
the war of ISI2 and the war with Mexico
and the war of the rebellion, in which the
blood of patriots was poured out that the
glory and stability of our system of gov
ernment might not fail of purpose.
It is plain to be seen that there is a wave
of thoughtless enthusiasm for a wild and
reckless cause rushing over the country,
but it will subside when tbe people begin
to consider it with their sober second
thought. When the sober second thought
of the people takes up for analysis the
aims and purpose of Aiteeldism they will
see as does a high Government official that
"no political issue is involved in the com
ing election. . The question to be decided
is far deeper and more vital. The perpe
tuity of republican institutions has been
threatened. Every loyal citizen should
ally himself against the forces which con
trolled the Chicago convention, the forces
of lawlessness, which are inconsistent with
the maintenance of the Republic. Hence
forth there should be no Republican, no
Democrat, but a union of loyal citizens
against the combined forces of repudia
tion and disorder. When once this dan
gerous element has been stamped out at
the polls by an indignant people we can
again divide and discuss those political
questions which for generations have kept
alive the two great political parties."
The leaders of the several revolutionary
factions admit that plans are now being
discus3ed for throwing the Bryan follow
ing to the Populists in Congressional dis
tricts where the latter outnumber the
former, and reverse this order where the
Bryanites show the greater numerical
strength. The idea ii. of course, to have
the majority of Congress composed of an
element that would be in accord in setting
aside all tbe established principles of the
Government and substituting for them
the communistic theories of Altgeld
and the sectionalism of Tiliman. Any
kind of a trade will be made that promises
additional strength to the revolutionists.
Mr. Bryan has set out to appeal to the
"common people" for support. It is cvi
i dent that he means to inaugurates war of
; classes and set brother against brother
j and community against community,
which would be far worse in consequences
| than auy race war that history give? Ac-
I count of. Less than a week aco Mr.
Bryan was nominated by the Altgeld-Tiil
nian convention, but he has already
eliminated the economic issues which di
| vided the two great parties and planted
his foot square and fair upon the doctrine
I of sectionalism, and from that platform
j he appeals to the '-common people" to
! elect him President, that he may revamp
i tne true and tried principles of govern
ment and make them conform to what
will amount to liberty without law and
ruinous contention in the people's com
: mercial and social life. The sober second
thought of the people is relied upon to
prevent this great wrong.
WOMAN'S SUFFREAGE.
In a recent letter to The Call Susan B.
j Anthony directed public attention to the
I rapid advance of sentiment in this Btate
iin favor of woman suffrage. To use her j
! words, the action of the Republican con
; veniion "invested the question at once '
i with the dignity of a political issue and
j enabled the newspapers of the Slate to in
j dorse it with the party sanction. This has
I been done with remarkable unanimity,
j over 100 of them having declared editorially
|in favor of the pending amendment. To
j The Call of May 3 rightfully belongs the
credit of inspiring that action on the part
of the convention."
That which Miss Anthony calls a growth
of sentiment would be more aptly termed
a growing courage in the avowal of senti
ment. The opinion of the intelligent peo
ple of California has long been favorable
to the extension of suffrage to women. It
! has not avowed itself very strongly in the
I paÂ«t, because it has lacked political leader-
I ship. That need has now been furnished.
j Some of the ablest women of America are
here actively engaged in urging on the
canvass. The Republican party, flushed
vrith assurances of victory, has blazoned
tbe cause upon its banners and fights for
woman's suffrage as we.l as for protection.
I Tbe earnest and progressive newspapers
of the interior range themselves with The
Call in the contest. When the canvas be
gins there will be orators to speak for jus
tice to women from every platform in the
State. AH, therefore, goes well, and the
prospects of success brighten on every
side.
Republicans shonld take a special pride
and interest in this issue of the campaign.
It is one that appeals to liberal an i pro
gressive men, and there will be fidelity to
Republican traditions in supporting and
advancing it. Let it be kept to the front
from this time on. Let no voter overlook
it. When we vote for protection to the
American home, let as also vote for jus
tice to those who make the home worth
having.
PRANOE EXCITED.
The alleged attempt of a man by the
name of Francois to kill President Faure
on the LongchampÃ parade-ground serves
the good purpose of further cementm_
the opposition to the restoration to the
head of the Government of any of the "by
the grace of God" dynasties, but beyond
that the event is of no very great inter
national consequence. The man Francois
is crazy, no doubt, and had no intention
of harming the President. It appears
that his pistol was loaded with blank
cartridges, and perhaps it it true, as he
says, that he merely wanted to get the
President's attention when he iired at
him. Anyway, the fellow is known to the
police as a lunatic who has recently been
engaged in firing petitions and the like at
the Chamber of Deputies.
The political effect of such performances
is decidedly good for France in that the
spontaneous resentment by the people of
an attack upon the highest official of the
country goes to show how wedded the
French people are to their republic.
P'aure himself is far from being a popu
lar man. He has been hissed more than
once by the crowds as he passed along,
but on such occasions he was not so par
ticularly represeniing the nation as when
reviewing the army, when Francois fired
at him. This is not the first time the
French people have had an opportunity to
express their loyalty to the republic since
tne fall of the last empire, and it may be
said of them that, if surface indications go
for anything, the principles of republican
ism are quite as deeply rooted in the
hearts of the Frenchmen as in the citizens

of any other republic. To be sure, the
French republic is a good deal of a
monarchy in many respects, but French
thinkers know very well that the people
are as free to-day as they are capable of
being, and that more personal liberty than
they can comfortably digest would quick
ly result in communism practically ap- ,
plied. '
TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS,
There are two economic theories which
the people mean to have put into prac
\ ticat operation upon a basis that shall be
permanent. One is a schedule of import
duties that shall secure ample protection
to our industries against hurtful foreign in
vasion ; the other is a bimetallic currency
upon a basis that shall make coins inter
changeable because one is as good as the
other for redemption money purposes.
Mr. Bryan assumes himself to be the
champion of bimetallism, but neither him
self nor a single one of his admirers is
equal to the solution of such a problem;
; besides, he is opposed to protection, and
protection and bimetallism necessarily go
together.
There will be protection and there will
be a bimetallic currency, but neither can
be established except by men who are
statesmen in the broadest and fullest
meaning of the term. The Democratic
party has driven all of its great political
economists away from it by its Chicago
declaration of principles, which mistakes
silver monometallism for bimetallism.
And since these statesmen, who have been
expelled by their own party, are affiliating
with the Republican party in so far as the
money question is concerned, it would
seem that all true bimetailists would not
think of looking elsewhere for ability and
experience to formulate a plan to secure
the desired result. Moreover, the Repub
lican party is pledged to bimetallism, as
J are the expelled statesmen from the Dem
i ocratic party, and it is also true that
j statesmanship of the highest order will be
required to place the Nation's financial
system upon a bimetallic foundation. It
is not a matter of mere child's y>!ay to do
it right, and if not done right it were bet
ter that it not be done at all.
Nothing could be more harmful to the
j material affairs of the people than tinker
j ing witn the industrial and money ques
; tion by incompetent men. The people
i cannot afford to trust the solution of such
j problems to men who preach the wildest
I political vagaries. The importance of
having these two great questions settled
right should be clear to every thinking
! man. That they must he settled there is
no doubt whatever if the fundamental
j principles of the Government are to be
; maintained. Nor should they be settled
j today to be overhauled to-morrow, but
i when they are settled it should be upon a
| lasting basis. It iÂ«, or should be, clear to
; every one who is not blinded by partisan
i ship that as the several parties now stand
â¢ in relation to the spirit of the purpose of
1 tne nation, the duty of accomplishing
j proper tariff legislation, and a bimetallic
| currency devolves upon tne Republican
party. It has the experience, the wisdom
and the desire to so adjust these two great
questions that the ereatest possible good
may accrue to all the people, while, on
the other hand, the Bryan party lacks ex
perience and wisdom ; besides it is com
mitted to settle all public questions upon
sectional lines. As a matter of business,
J therefore, the people should lose sight of
politics and commit the work of putting
the country npon a sure commercial and
financial foundation to such true and tried
hands as Mr. McKinley and his coworkers
for the good of America.
CONSERVATIVE BIMETALLISTS
The statements made by Francis A.
Walker before the Bimetallic League in
London and by Jay C'ooke, the noted
Philadelphia financier, in an interview
published in The Call yesterday, sbow
thp judgment of earnest and conservative
bimetailists on the present situation of
the cause in America. Both declare in
favor of McKinley and express their oppo
sition to the Chicago platform and ticket.
They agree that the election of Uryan, so
far from advancing the cause of bimetal
lism, would retard it by putting this coun
try upon the basis of silver monometal
lism and permanently establishing the
gold system in Europe.
The view of these distinguished men is
exactly that which has been taken by The
Call, and, in fact, by conservative silver
men generally. Nothing can be gained
for any cause by intrusting it to the hands
of reckless and ignorant men. No farmer
would leave the plowing of his fields to a
man who did not know bow to hold a
plow and was, moreover, fonder of talning
than of working. Why then, should he
intrust important measures ot statecraft
to incompetent hands? Left to the man
agement of Bryan, a change in our financial
system would result in disasters that
would discredit bimetallism for years.
We have seen what resulted from intrust
in v tariff reform to that brilliant orator,
William Wilson of Virginia, and no sane
man will willingly repeat the experiment
dv intrusting financial reform to the boy
orator of the Platte.
THE IRISH LAND BILL.
The collapse of the Irish land bill in
Parliament is likely to oblige a complete
reorganization of the Ministry, although,
the whole business looks like a premedi
tated thing. The bill was never satisfac
i tory to the Irish members because it was
not only considered unfair, but was in
tended to be final. Rather than be shut
out from further efforts in behalf of Irish
land renters, Dillon and his colleagues
forced the withdrawal of the measure, it
is hinted that Chamberlain, who is the
brains of the Ministry, is scheming to be
Premier and that the failure of the bill is
not at all distasteful to him. But, how
ever that may be, the Irish landlords have
certainly won a temporary victory at least,
and unless the administration appeals to
| tbe people for indorsement and is defeated
i the fruits of the victory are likely to be
i long drawn out.
The fact of the matter is that since the
! death of Parneli the Irish members cannot
j agree among themselves upon any meas
ure in which Ireland has direct interest.
Some of them always find an objection
; which, for the most part, looks like
a play for the favor "of the voters
in their districts. Had the Irish con
tingent as a whole cultivated more quod
' feeling for Ireland and paid less attention
j to personal political preferment no doubt
! home rule would have prevailed in Ire
land long ago.
The remonetization of silver cannot be
entrusted to the management of men like
Bryan, Altgeld and Tillrcan. Only by
the administration of conservative states
men can that great result be accomplished
with safety to business interests.
The Democratic attack on the Supreme
Court strikes at one of the great bulwarks
of the Government, and proves that party
to be as hostile to the constitution as it is
to industry.
Jay Cooke is one of the sturdy bimetai
lista who will vote for McKinley and other
silver men of good sense will do likewise.
MUSIC &
MUSICIANS
A new star has arisen in the prlma donna
firmament in Milan. Marad'Asty, a young,
bright-Â«yed Roumanian of bewitching beauty,
has created an impression among the impres
sari. The musical sages of Milan declare that
she is a natural phenomenon in coloratura
singing and is destined to be the successor of
Adelina Patti. This lady will make her Paris
debut at the beginning of the winter season
and will then undertake a long concert and
opera tour in Germany and Rusoia.
At Wechmar, near Gotha, the municipal
council has had an inscription placed upon
the house where, in 1600, lived Veit Bach, the
ancestor of the family of the great cantor of
Lei^sig. Veit Bach, of whom J. S. Bach often
spoke, was a baker, and he and his son Hans
exercised their calling in the old family house
at Wecnmar which is still standing. The son,
Hans Bach, had learned music at Gotha and
played with a certain artistic reputation.
William Stcinway, the Principal Creditor of Abbey k Grau.
One eonnts, in seven generations, more than
a hundred defendants of Veit Bach, of whom
the greater part are known in the history of
German inuÂ«ic.
The news of the death of the Brazilian com
poser, Carlos Gomes, published in the Bahia
and Pernambuco papers of May 21, was prema
ture. Unfortunately it was only premature,
for this excellent artist has developed an in
curable complaint, cancer of the tongue, for
which it is impossible to operate. Carlos Go
mes is at this moment at Para, a prey to the
most teirible sufferings, and the doctors in at
tendance, of whom It is said there are at least
twenty-one, affirm that it is impossible to save
him, and give him at most three or four
months of existence.
In France, it seems, there Is a strong super
stition that the operas of Ambroise Thomas
bring tome sort ol iS)-luck. The Paris Opera
Comique, and the Tneatre dcs Arts, at Rouen,
were burned on tbe night of the performance of
"Mignon," in which, it may be recollected, a
fire scene actually occurs. The Grand Onera,
Paris, was burned on the night of a perform
ance of "Hamlet," while the recent accident
to a chandelier which nearly set the new thea
ter alight happened during the public rehear
sal of "Hamlet." Then M. Lassalle, before the
revival, two or three years ago, of the same
opera, in London, fell from a gig, and tbe,num
ber of coidg caught by prime donne before
playing Ophelia are beyond count. Thomas
himsclt was well aware of the superstition
Rnd used laughingly to declare that he was
lucky in other way..
The Mene-strel says that the rehearsals for
the Triology have commenced at Bayreuth.
No arti-t of 1876 will take a part except M.
Yogi, the celebrated tenor of the Munich
opera, who will sing in "LOr dv Rhin" the
role of Loge, which he created in so remark
able a manner twenty years ago. Mme.
Materna still livesâ she is even giving concerts
in some part of Western Americaâ but she will
no more lead Grane, the black horse of the
Valkyrie, over the planks of Bayreuth. One of
the sisters Lehmann is still singing?, but she
will sing no more at Bayreuth. The other
sister has retired. Many of the artists have
quitted this world, among others the cele
brated baeso, Scaxia, who created the role of
Wotan. But above all that will be missing
this year will be the genius of the master who
in 1876 gave spirit to the whole performance.
The tradition still survives, but it is very
doubtful whether that will suffice. The con
ductors will be Hans Richter, Felix Mottl and
Siegfried Wagner.
A few weeks ago there was an account in the
papers of two Italian pianists who undertook
to remain at their instruments for fifty hours
consecutively, playing all the' time. Now a
similar occurrence has taken place at Turin,
tnis time between mandolinists, and must
nave been more trying, for the uninterrupted
scratching of a quill upon the cords of a man
dolin would be enough to excite the nerves of
the most insensible. There were fourteen
mandolinists, seven of each sex, who met at
Turin to strike tne chords on this memorable
occasion. The heroes of this festival pos
seted the -faculty of eating and drinking
without ceasing to play, which in itself ap
pears to be rather a difficult feat. The first
prize, a gold medal, was gained by M. Luigi
Novaro of Turin, who tortured his mandolinâ
and his audienceâ for twenty-three hours and
fifty-five minutes. The performance of the
ladies in this struggle could hardly be called
heroic. However, three ot them resisted for
eighteen hours, which is a pretty good record,
But the four others wilted quilo early In the
fight. What strikes one as being prodigious is
that it was possible to secure amateurs will
ing to act as judges at such a seanceâ people
who were not forced to come, bu; were ani
mated solely by the love of art.
The Bavarian Cnamber of Deputies, in a dis
cussion relative to the subsidy granted to the
opera of Munich, criticized tne increase of
price for places in the Wagner Theater at Bay
reuth. Now they have wn: ten from Bayreuth
to the German papers saying that this state
ment is without foundation. The price of
places has not changed since 1876, because
the expenses for so short a time are too great
to allow oi a reduction. The representations
of 187G left a deficit of 342,500 marks. Wagner
hoped that he would be accorded a subvention
from the Government or from some German
Prince, but not having obtained the least as
sistance he sold to the director, Angelo Neu
mann, all the decorations aud accessories of
"The N'ibelungen," and conceded to the Royal
Opera-house of Munich the author's rights in
all his works. Since 1882 until now the repre
sentations at Bayreuth of "Parsifal," "Tris
tan," "Meistersingers," ''Tannhauser" and
| "Lohengrin" have regularly brought in on an
: average 50,000 marks a year, but this sum has
always been put in the reserve fund and has
now reached 300,000 marks, but there will
not be much of it left this year, as it is found
necessary to renew completely the decorations
and costumes for "The Trlology," and the re
turns from the representations are only ex
pected to cover the current expenses. Mme.
Cosima Wagner, it is said, always considers
Bayreuth as a purely disinterested and artis
tic enterprise, solely destined to glorify tne
work of the master.
William Stelnway, who, as a $50,000 cred
itor of the Abbey <fc Grau firm, and in conse
quence a 40 per cent shareholder in the new
company, has become a sort of impressario.
Speaking of the operatic outlook, he says:
"What do I think of Mapleson's coming? Well,
I wish him well, but I tell you frankly I see
nothing in store for Colonel Mapleeon. Inter
fere in any way witn Abbey <fc Gran? Never.
1 Impartially speaking, there seems to me no
j basis here upon wnich Mapleson can success
j fully return. He might have some following
j in the provincial cities, where Abbey <fc Grau
j do not go, but I doubt if even there money
will be forthcoming. As to the report that
Mr. Grau may succeed Sir Augustus Harris in
London, it has foundation and I am decidedly
i in favor of such an Issue. By the new terms
!of agreement Abbey, Schoeffel & Grau are
pledged to enter into no outside theatrical
venture, but Covent Garden. London, is an
exception. Mr. Grau is well suited to the
position. He knows the operatic world, speaks
four or five languages and would work to their
best ends all the possibilities of the London
situation."

With keenest glances of surprise.

To maids and matrons, sires and sons.
And iinrnatures- little ones.

That bore them swift as swiftest wings:
Through every busy thoroughfare,

The prairies reached o'er endless space,
Where rivers ran. where'er the face
Of earth revealed an open way,
a wheeling-, whirling, fleet array
Of human forms in ceaseless flight
Was shown unto his wondering sight;
And standing there as one aghast,

Then, proudly llftine up his head,
In self-applauding tone he said:

STEAMERS TO PLY
ROUND THE HORN.
Two Lines in Prospect of
Being Established on
the Route.
RATES NOW TOO LOW.
Waiting for Freights to Be Ad
vanced by the Transconti
nental Lines.
MONSTER SHIPS TO BE BUILT.
Some of the Peculiar Features of the
Through Transportation Situa
tion Outlined.
Never before in the history of San Fran
cisco was the transportation situation, so
far as through freights between here and
Xew York is concerned, so involved and
so full of uncertainties as at the present
time. It is alto great with prospects of
new enterprises.
Rates by rail by tbe Isthmus and the
Horn are at the lowest possible notch,
and though there have been sometimes
vague and sometimes definite reports that
a decided advance was to take place, noth
ing of a nature to gladden the hearts of
transportation companies and agents has
occurred.
It is generally admitted that the trans
continental lines now control the situation
md that until they come to an under
standing and arrangement whereby freight
rates may be increased there can be no
change for the better.
It is further admitted that rates are not I
likely to be advanced on the rail lines until
the debt of the Central Pacific Company
to the Government is disposed of, either by
refunding or by foreclosure of the Govern
ment's mortgage, as under the present
condition of things Mr. Huntington could
not afford to allow the Central Pacific Rail
road to make any money. It would taKe
away nis chief and best argument in favor
of refunding.
But wnenever the time comes that rates
are advanced to where the balance will
show on the right side of the ledger of the
water-carriers, there are two separate
steamship lines promised for the route be
tween San Francisco and New York via
Cape Horn.
One of these will be operated by the
Johnson-Locke Mercantile Company of
this City and the other by Flint & Co. of
New York.
It is now definitely announced that Rut
ton & Co., whose assignment at New York
was mentioned in The Call yesterday,
will retire for good from the clipper busi
ness. That the firm was in financial
straits for some time past has been well
known in this City, and with the death of
Woodworth Sutton, who was the ac
knowledged brains and brawn of the firm,
on the Bth of June, its collapse was con
sidered to be but a matter of time. So the
news of the failure came with little or no
surprise to the local shipping men and
merchants.
It was in anticipation of just this devel
opment that Flint & Co. conceived the
idea of putting on a line of clipper ships,
and the inauguration of the new com
pany's enterprise is now but a matter of
days.
Alien M. Sutton of Sutton & Beebe. the
local agents of Sutton & Co. of New York,
has secured a berth with Vv illiams, Dimond
& Co., who are agents for tbe Dispatch
line of clippers operated by Dearborn &
Co. of New York.
J. F. Chapman & Co. are to be the local
agents of the Flint clipper line, whose in
terests in New York are to be managed by
Simpson & Haldt.
At the office of Chapman <fe Co. it was
learned yesterday that in the event of the
clipper business being developed, as it was
confidently hoped it would be, tbe clippers
would in due time be replaced with steam
er? and the time round the Horn be
thereby reduced from 180 days, or six
months, to 60 days, or two months.
About three years ago the Johnson-
Locke Mercantile Company operated a
line of steamers around the Horn for a
year and a half and witn satisfactory re
suits, but the rate war that began at that
time made the project unprofitable. Five
steamers were in service, with an average
capacity of about 3500 tons.
Rumors have been current for some
time that tbe same company was about to
resume operations with steamers around
the Horn. Frank Johnson was asked
about the matter yesterday and admitted
that such plans were under consideration.
"We are not ready to talk about the
project now," he declared. "We cannot
do anything at this time, nor until the
railroad rates in force at present are ad
vanced, for there would be no money in it
trying to compete for business at the low
figures that prevail. It would be prema
ture for me to speak in detail of the mat
ter ai the present time."
Should Flint <fe Co. decide to convert
their proposed clipper line into a steam
ship, it is their purpose to have special
steamers built for the business. They
will be Between 5500 and 6000 tonnage
capacity each, so as to carry sufficient
cargo to return a fair profit, it being
claimed that smaller vessels would be
much more costly to operate in proportion
to tbe size.
Interesting in this connection is a report
received by a prominent local shipping
firm from New York that the revised rates
decided upon by the Transcontinental
Traffic Association a few months ago were
to go into operation on the Ist of August.
Confirmation of the news, however, was
not obtainable.
FRUIT EXCHANGE OFFICERS.
Herman Bendel Jbiected to Succeed
President Dalton.
At the annual meeting yesterday of the
San Francisco Fruit Exchange the follow
ing officers were elected for the ensuing
year: President, Herman Bendel; vice
preÃident, J. L. Wilson; treasurer, Abe
Rosenberg; directorsâ D. E. Allison, H.
Bendel, P. D. Code, W. A. Curtis, Frank
Dalton. A. G. Freeman, C. C. Kinsey, Abe
Rosenberg, J. L. Wilson. T. 8. Taylor was
re-elected as secretary by the board of
directors.
President Dalton in retiring submitted,
his annual report for tbe past year, in the
course of which he advises the adoption of
some system that would bring members
together more frequently upon the floor
of the exchange. The standards which
bad been sent throughout tbe East he
fcaid had educated Eastern buyers in
choice and fancy fruits. Beneficial results
had also been reported from the circular
sent out by the exchange to the evapo
rated apple people of this coast, wsrniug
them against -\Htering their dried apples.
"We have been groping in the dark for
many years," he concluded, "and the
dried-fruit business has become of such
magnitude that it is necessary to educate
not only ourselves but every one con
nected with the fruit business in modes,
manner and style of doing business, and
it should be the duty of this exchange to
act in that capacity.'^

Dr. John Fryer, LL.D., for thirty-seven
years a resident of China, has arrived in
Oakland and is stopping at his brother's,

great study. I have brought home with
me 600 volumes of Chinese wonts for a
nucleus of a library ; 316 of them comprise
a Chinese encyclopedia of the latest and
most authentic issue. Many of the others
are some of the oldest editions in the

"The effect of the late war has been

SUTRO RATIFIED
FOR MR, BRYAN,
Lively Meeting of the Elec
tion Commissioners
Yesterday.
WOULD NOT BE SHUT OFF
His Honor Hammered With His
Gavel and Demanded
His Rights.
NO CLEBKS SELECTED AS YET.
The Merchants' Association Invited
to Present Four Hundred
Names.
Mayor Sntro tried yesterday to turn the
meeting of the Board of Election Com
missioners into a red-hot ratification
meeting on Bryan's nomination, and suc
ceeded in doing so for a few moments.
The several plans for selecting election
officers, including that of the Merchants'
Association, were under consideration and
the Mayor asked until next Tuesday to
consider the matter, his request being op
posed by Commissioners Creswell and
Brodenck.
The opposition seemed to anger the
Mayor, for he at once launched into a de
nunciation of politicians and political in
trigue in general, emphasizing his remarks
with a vigorous thumping of his gavel on
the desk.
Commissioner Broderick tried to stem
the torrent of words with a motion to ad
journ, but the Mayor would not be denied
and said that he would not put the
motion â that he knew his rights as chair
man of the commission, and that he pro
posed to exercise his right of free speech.
Having swept the decks of the enemy, the
Mayor proceeded to pour hot shot into
their battered hulls.
"The constitution of the United States,"
said his Honor, "was the greatest boon
ever given to man ; but things have
changed. The politicians, corporations
and trusts have got hold of this Govern
ment, and I will say so as often as I want
to. What rights have the small mer
chants and tbe middle classes? They have
none. They have been robbed of their
rights and we are on the eve of a great up
heaval. It has come to pass now in this
country that we are to have an election and
I want you to be careful how you vote.
The Republicans and the Democrats are
swindles. McKinley is a representative o*
corporations, but Bryan is an independent
man."
"Wow! wow!" yelled the gailery,
whether in derision or assent it was hard
to say, and the other Commissioners sat
silent until his Honor had subsided, and
then quietly voted down his motion to
postpone action.
President Dobrmann of the Merchants'
Association suegested that officers be em
ployed from the districts where they re
side, a plan that was favorably received
by the Commissioners. The association
was given a week to send in 400 names
which tlie commission will consider while
selecting its election officers.
The Commissioners decided not to place
the selection of names in the bands of a
committee of three, but will put tbe re
sponsibility on the shonlders of the clerks
in the Registration office.
THE RECORD BROKEN.
Registration at the . City Hall Has
Passed, Previous Figures.
The registration at the City Hall yester
day was 2379. as against 2798 for the pre.
vious day. The figures of yesterday ex
ceed that of any. one day in the history of
the Registrar's office. :
The highest number . ever registered in
any one day heretofore was 1 2506, on Octo
ber 19, 1894. This was ;â  considered a great
day's work, but under the present system
as many as 3000 can 'be registered *in one
day provided â :} the "intelligent" citizen
would smooth the wire edge of his temper
before presenting himself at the desk.
A sample <â  of this cross-grained disposi
tion was made manifest yesterday, when
a man presented' himself for registration,*
and after answering all the questions pat
to him be gave his occupation as an at-
tornev-at-law. The clerk asked him if be
could read the constitution of the United
States.
This question he considered an insult to
his intelligence and pointedly refused to
answer.
The result was that he was not regis
tered and left in anything but an even
temper.
SLOW IN PAYING TAXES.
Over 7000 Saloon-Keepers and Distil
lers Behind in Their Dues to the
Government.
Chief Deputy Loupe says special-tax
payers are unusually slow this year. Half
of the thirty days' grace allowed by cour
tesy ol Collector Welburn has elapsed and
yet only about 20 per cent of the 11,000
subject to taxation have appeared at the
office.
"At this rate," said Mr. Loupe, "not
over 50 per cent will come in by August
L TbiÃ means that tbe unfortunates will
be compelled to pay a fine equal to one
half of the tax imposed.'
Deputy Loupe will leave for Fresno to
morrow morning to make a survey of a
new distillery being erected by the Tenny
Canning Company. This will be the first
company to take advantage of the new
law allowing the making of brandy
from prunes, apricots, oranges and fruits
other than peaches and apples.
THE DIMOND ESTATE.
Application for the Appointment of a
Trustee Over Certain Property.
Application was yesterday made for the
appointment of a trustee to take charge of
certain property held in trust by the late
General William H. Dimond for his son,
Edwin R. Dimond, and his daughters,
Eleanor A. Jarboe and Mary G. Tobin.
The property in question was originally
giv-Mi to his children by General Diraond,
to !â¢" lield in trust by Horace G. PJatt, but
Mr. j'latt, some time before General
Dimon'i's death, resigned from tbe trustee
ship, which was assumed by the original
donor. 6ince General Dimond 'h death no
trustee has been appointed, aud now ap
plication has been made by Eclwin R.
Dimond and tiie Union Trust Company,
executors of the will of the deceased, for
the appointment of his successor.
SCHUETZEN LADIES' CLUB
The First Outing of a Thriving
Social Organiza
tion.
A Boatload cf Merry-Makers Under
the Auspices of a Committee
of Two Women.
The Tiburon boat leaving the foot of
Clay street at 11 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, carried a merry party of picknickers.
And the boat at 12:35, and even a3 late as
3:30 in the afternoon, supplemented the
party.
It was the picnic day of tbe Schuetzen
Ladies' Club at California Schuetzen Park.
The Scliuetzen Ladies' Club is an off
shoot of an older organization that fell to
pieces some time ago of its own weight.
The new club is composed of the best ele
ments of the old, the wives and daughters
and a few of the sweethearts of the mem
bers of the California Schuetzen Verein.
The president of the club is Mrs. J.
Thode, the vice-president Mrs. C. Schaefer,
the secretary Mrs. D. Heise and the treas
urer Miss Nora Garms.
The club has a bin membership of strictly
congenial spirits, and when it gives an
outing a thoroughly enjoyable time to
everybody who attends is a thing certain.
The committee having charee of yester
day's affair was composed of but two, Mrs.
ScLaefer and Mrs. Joseph Grafe. They
were quit* equal to the occasion, however.
Scliuetzen hark ran wild with merry
makers all day, bowling alley, shooting
range, dancing platform, merrj- go-round
and every other form of amusement being
in constant requisition. Excellent music
was provided. A number of the members
of the California Echuelzen Verem were in
attendance, and a bevy of children.
A banquet was spread in the dining-hall
of the park at about 3:30 o'clock. The
return was made to tbe City at about 6
o'clock.
This was the first outing of the club
and its success augurs well for frequent
repetitions.
FORT MASON MURDER.
Private Kelly's Statement That His
Two Razors Would Be Found in
His Locker Confirmed.
The preliminary examination of Private
James E. Kelly" of Battery E, Fifth
Artillery, charged with the murder of
Private James Quinn of Fort Mason last
Friday niaht, will be held before Judge
Gonlan to-morrow morning.
Notwithstanding the verdict of the
Coroner's jury, Kelly still protests his in
nocence, and a circumstance happened
yesterday that is a point, at least, in his
lavor.
When Kelly made a statement for pub
lication on Saturday ho declared posi
tively that the razor fonnd near Quinn's
body's did not belong to him. and added
that both his razors would be found in his
locker.
Yesterday Captain Vogdes handed over
to Police Property Clerk Moran the per
sonal effects found in Kelly's locker, and
among them were two razors, which con
firmed his statement.

Ii Dr. Marten Insane?
Dr. Arthur Marten, the erstwhile friend of
Alma Josselyn, is proving a troublesome pris
oner at the County Jail. Uis jailors entertain
the belief that he is insane. Marten's anger
seems to be directed mainly toward Judge
Campbell, and he threatens to blow that gen
tleman's head off as soon as his six months'
term expires. Tne erratic aoctor has aban
doned all hope of giving a $3000 bond to keep
tne peace. Marten was committed to jail for
threatening to kill his ward, Alma Josselyn.
The prison-keepers think the doctor insane.
The Police Tribunal.
The Police Commissioners met last night and
fined Policeman James Coot $ 20 for being late
in reporting on duty on July 4, and Policeman
Dennia Murphy $100 for being* intoxicated
while on duty. A charge of unofflcer-like con
duct against Policeman P. B. Chambers wai
dismissed.
Found Dead in Bed.
George Bradford, a sign painter. 60 years of
ape, was found dead in bed in his room at 9
Fourth street last evening. The Coroner was
notified and the body was taken to the
Morgue.

Her Hatches Were Taken Off and the
Work of Removing the Ballast
H s Begun.
The Harbor Commissioners decided
yesterday to rush work on the ferry depot.
Colusa stone will be used and the risk of
an appeal to the Supreme Court will be
run. When the contract was originally
let it was understood that Oregon gray
sandstone was to be used. The Commis
sioners later decided to use the California
stone and an injunction was sued out.
Judge Slack ruled in favor of the Commis
sioners, and now it is feared that an ap
peal will be taken to the Supreme Court.
The board held a secret session yesterday,
and on the advice of Tirey L. Ford it was
decided to go ahead and risk the conse
quences.
A great deal of work has been done on
the iron frame of the building, and al
ready tbe north wing is assuming shape.
A dozen heavy girders are in place and
before the week is ended a large portion of
the concrete surface of the foundation will
be shaded by a steel roof.
The launch Amy has just come off the
ways after a thorough overhauling. She

The steam schooner Protection and the
tug Reliance returned from the wreck of
the Colombia yesterday. Neither vessel
brought any wreckage.
Captain Burns expects to have the Blair
more up to-day. Yesterday the men were
at work shoveling out the ballast, and
good progress was made before the tide
came up and necessitated the battening
down of the hatches again. At low water
this morning work will be resumed, and if
the wreckers' hopes are realized the vessel
will be on an even keel at noon.
So far none of the bodies of the drowned
sailors have been recovered and the
chances are that they are buried under
tons of debris. The divers are of the
opinion that the remains were washed out
of the hold and carried out to sea long
before the work of raising the vessel be
gan.
The heavy fog that has prevailed along
the coast for the past few days has delayed
all kinds of shipping. Nothing has made
time outside of the tugboats, and they
come and go at will. Even the coasting
steamers have been behind time, and sail

CALIFORNIA POPULISTS WANT A POPULIST PRESIDENT
AND A POPULIST PLATFORM
OUT FOR CALDWELL
The Arkansas Judge Is
Their Favorite Just at
This Time.
DELEGATIONS LEAVE.
Populists Are Indignant at the
Silver Indorsement of
Bryan.
DEMAND A POPULIST NOMINEE.
To-Day Two Party Delegations Depart
to Take a Hand in the St.
Lou s Game.
This morning the Populist delegation to
the National Convention will leave San
Francisco, and this evening the California
delegation to the silver convention, which
will also meet on July 22 at St. Louis, will
take its departure on the overland train.
California has heretofore sent two dele
gations to the East on different dates, and
here it will send forth two on the same
day, botn of which will cut quite a figure
in not only the politics of California dur
iDg this campaign, but in the politics of
the Nation.
The Populist delegation will leave at 7
o'clock this morning. It may not prop
erly be said to have any head, as it has not
vet elected a chairman, and probably will
iiot do so until it gets to St. Louis, but in
the meantime E. M. Wardall. the chair
man of the State Centrai Committee and
one of the delegates at large, may be taken
to be the head of the delegation. Some
thirty Populists will leave on this even-
t
Judge Henry Clay Caldwell of Arkansas, the Favorite Candidate Among the California Populist
Delegates.
ing's train, without style or brass bands,
and they will sleep during the journey in
second-class tourist-cars.
The silver delegation, which ostensibly
will number forty-five and which will
actually number about thirty, and which
is headed by Georee W. Baker, a member
of the National Committee from California
of the American Bimetallic Union, gene
ral boss of the Pacific Coast silver repre
sentation and special correspondent of
The Call, will leave this evening on the
regular trait; in two special Pullman cars, !
appropriately decorated and emblazoned. â 
The departure of these two delegations j
is attended by two new features. The
California Populists' delegation is not |
centered upon any Presidential candidate; i
it contains but two or three partisans of
W. J. Bryan and its favorite is Judge
Henry Ciay Caldwell of Arkansas,
who is not talked very much about in the j
papers just now, but who is likely to be j
one of the most-talked-about men whose !
names will be telegraphed from St. Louis j
five days from now.
The California Popul'st delegation also j
leaves, strangely enough, at outs with the
California silver delegation. The reason
is that the California silver delegation,
dominated by George W. Baser, has de
rlared in favor of the indorsement of Mr.
Bryan, as has the Nevada silver delega
tion, which is said to be also largely domi
nated by Mr. Baker.
The California Populists are not by any
means in favor ol indorsing Mr. Bryan.
They are not only in favor of an out and
out, true-blue Populists as their Presiden
tial candidate, but they also charge the
Pacific Coast silver delegation with acting
in bad faith.
When, in the latter part of July last, the
committee of seven from the Populist
State Central Committee, of which E. M.
Wardall of California was a member, met,
in Washington, the Senators and others
who formed the American Bimetallic
Union out of the three or four then exist
ing silver organizations, it was tacitly and
honorably agreed among the leaders there
assembled that neither the Populists nor
the silver men should boom any candidate
for the Presidency or otherwise take a
leading part in the campaign until thÂ»
two National conventions should convene
in St. T,ouis. It was well understood that
at those joint conventions conference com
mittees should be appointed, and the
Populists and the independent free-silver
men should endeavor to agree upon a
platform and a candidate.
This tacit agreement has been kept by a
part but not all of tne leading men of both
parties. The indorsement of Bryan by the
silver delegation from California the other
night was a distinct violation of this
agreement; so was the silver indorsement
of Bryan by the Nevada delegation.
This makes the Populist delegation feel
sore. The Caliiornia Populist delegation
is not for Bryan, and while it recognizes
the fact that the California silver delega
tion was not wholly bound by the confer
ence of the silver leaders in Washington,
still the Populists feel that in indorsing
Bryan the agreement has been violated
and an estrangement has resulted.
The unit rule has not yet been declared
to be in force in the California Populist
delegation, but it may be ordered before
the delegation reaches St. Louis. The
Populist National delegation is not torn
by intense partisans of anybody. In it are
many friends oi Teller, the majority of
whom would supp6rt Mr. Teller for the
Presidential nomination if he would come
out and declare himself a Populist.
The Populists, however, insist upon the
nomination of a Populist. Bryan they do
not trust very much as a rule.
Judge Caldwell is at this particular hour
the favorite of the California delegation.
The delegation leaves San Francisco
bound by no unit rule, uninstructed by
anybody, divided as to preferences and
ready to voto for the man who may seem
the most available one when the parly
representatives convene next week.
btill, their favorite is Judge Henry Clay
Caldwell of Arkansas. This man was
much and seriously talked about during
the early conferences of the Populists and
Silverites. He is the sort of a man that
the majority of the Populists are looking
for. He was born in Virginia, was reared
in lowa, and in 1860 became a volunteer
officer in the Rebellion. In 1864 he was
appointed a District Judge in Arkansas by
Abraham Lincoln. In 1890 be was ap
pointed Circuit Judge for the Eighth Cir
cuit of the United States Court of Ap
peals, which includes ten States west of
the Mississippi River. His decisions in
corporation cases have especially en
deared him to the Populist party.
Opinions are not freely expressed for
publication by leaders in the Populist
deleeation, but Mr. Caldwell is unques
tionably the favorite, if there is one. One
may hear the California delegates talk
nicely about Peffer, Allen, Holcorob,
Jud^e Hines of Georgia, Page of Virginia,
n-Con^ressman Thomas Watson of
Georgia, E. V. Debs and two or three oth
ers, and one may easily hear a great deal
that is favorable to Teller, but when one
has talked with a number of the California
Populist delegation, he makes up his mind
that the delegation will do something or
other that wlll| depend upon circum
stances which will be set forth at the con
vention.
"There is a positive opinion in the dele
gation," said John B. Dore yesterday, "in
favor of, the nomination of an out and out
Populist. And we want some Populist
who has been hatched long enough to
have bis pinfeathers showing. We are as
far from one of the old parties as from the
other."
Chairman Wardal! will say little that is
definite about what the delegation will do
but intimates that Mr. Caldwell would
win the confidence of both the laboring
and the capitalistic classes.
So the California Populist delegation
leaves this morning without pomp and
without style to cast twenty-nine votes in
a National convention which has great
National significance, and it leaves with
Judge Caldwell of Arkansas as its favorite,
but ready to plump the twenty-nine votes
for something or other that may be drawn
from the lottery that is just ahead.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1896.
There will not, however, be more than
three votes for W. J. Bryan.
While the Populists will not discuss for
publication the possibilities of. a fusion
.vith the Democrats it i? made very evi
dent that if Bryan be indorsed at St.
Louis the Populists will demand in turn a
very large share of the Congressional
plums throughout the Nation. They may
be willing to let Bryan have the Wnite
House and all that goes with it if he can
get it, but their price will be tQe law
making power. It will be hard and in
fact practically impossible for National
party authorities to carry out any deal
which might here and there give the Con
gressional elections to the Populists as far
as the Democrats are concerned, because
State and district influences will be apt to
act independently.
So the smallness of the chance of a
fusion between the Democrats and Popu
lists is thereby seen to be still more
remote.
The silver delegation, which will leave
to-night on tho first-class overland train,
will have a little more style, monexr and
possibly clean shaves about it than may
be observed in the Populist special cars
which leave in the morning.
There may or may not be much news of
great importance floatine backward from
the silver delegation on its trip to St.
Loui-, and when it reachas St. Louis it is
possible that the silver convention will do
nothing more than ratify the nomination
of W. J. Bryan and thereby cast into outer
darkness a large proportion of the strength
that now belongs to this inchoate move
ment.
CAN PROVE AN ALIBI.
John Snmmcrs Grocer, Charged With
Threats to Kill by F. J. Gordon,
Saloon- X eeper.
P. J. Gordon, saloon-keeper, 1633 Market
street, swore to a complaint in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday charging
John Sommers, grocer, Brady street, with
threats to kill.
He said that Sommars went into his
saloon about 8 o'clock yesterday morning
and startled him by telling him that if he
turned out with the Bryan Political Club
of the Thirty-seventh Assembly District
he would kill him.
Sommers was arrested and booked at
the City Prison, but was released on
bonds. He denied making any threat to
kill Gordon or speaking to him about turn
ing out with any political club.
"Why," said Sommers, "I haven't been
inside Gordon's saloon for months and I
can easily prove that I was certainly not
there this morning. He must be dream
| ing. lam a witness in a case of robbery
against John Kehoe, a friend of Gordon's,
and perhaps he has done this to get even
I with me. I saw him in Judge Conlan's
court on Monday and this morning, but I
did not speak to him nor be to me.
MARGARET MURRAY'S ESTATE.
Charles Connell Claim* That His Step
father la Appropriating; It.
Charles Connell of Sonoma County yesÂ»
terday filed a contest to the will of Mar
garet Murray, who died June 29, 1896,
leaving property, mostly money in bank,
valued at $4323. Dennis Murray, husband
of the deceased, tiled the documents for
probate and petitioned for letters of ad
ministration.
Connell is a son of Mrs. Murray's first
husband and objects to his stepfather
being appointed administrator, because of
the latter' s age and physical condition.
Murray is 80 years old and the complaint
recites that he is consequently possessed
of poor judgment, helples?, senile and in
competent Connell. who is 48 years of
age, asks that he be given charge of the
estate. It is also charged that Murray
retained $2300 of his wife's estate and ap
propriated it to his own use when the
estate was appraised.
The other heir? are Mary O'Brien, Le
nora McKeon and Gertrude. Nellie and
May Gould, the first two being daughters
and the others grandchildren of Mrs. Mar
ray. All reside in San Francisco.
BRYAN MUST YIELD
If Not, California Populists
Will Knife Him at
St. Louis.
A PROPOSED PLATFORM.
It Will Be Submitted for Adop
tion at tbe St. Louis Con
vention.
ITS PEOMINEKT FEATURES.
Dr. 6 W. Day wait, One of the Dele
gation, Speaks of the Chances
of Fusion-
For some time the leading members of the
Populist party in California have been at
work preparing what is termed "A pro
posed National platform of the People's
party."
The intention is for the same to be
carried to St. Louis by the California
delegation and there to be submitted to the
National Convention.
Much pains has been taken by the per
sons to whom the duty of drafting this
platform was assigned. It is as concise in
form as the authors deem compatible with
force and clearness.
The rongh draft was first made by Taylor
Rogers, who afterward pruned and revised
the original document. In this revision
he was assisted by Dr. G. W. Day wait, one
of the California delegation, and E. M.
Wardall, chairman of the Populist State
Central Committee.
The most prominent features of the
proposed National platform, and those on
whicn the greatest stress is laid, are the
questions of finance, transportation, land
and direct legislation. Questions regarded
as important but not so urgent of im
mediate adoption are civil service, cor
porate monopoJies, income tax, tariff,
election of President and Senators, pen
sions, Monroe doctrine, issuance of Gov
ernment bonds, funding bill, immigration,
Cuban independence, woman suffrage and
continuance of settled policies. At the
last the author makes a strong plea to his
fellow-countrymen to study well the pro
posed platform and take heed unto the
present condition of National affairs.
In full the proposed platform is as
follows:
The People's party of the United State*, rep
resented in National Convention at St. Louis,
Missouri, on the 22d day of July, 1896. hereby
proclaims these as its principles upon finance,
transportation, land and direct legislation,
and it promises to enact them Into "laws im
mediately upon it* accession to power:
FINANCE.
Firstâ l. We demand a National money .issned
directly by the General Government only, as a
fall legal tender for all debts, and issued with
out the agency of any private corporation or
bank, and in circulating volume subject to law
and responsive to our needs, ana speedily to
be increased to $50 per capita of the entire
people.
Such money shall consist of cold, silver and
paper, each dollar thereof endowed with the
same function, imparted solely by the stamp
thereon and not dependent for its money value
upon the price of the material used. Each dol
lar shall be interchangeable with bat not re
deemable in the other, and shall be denomi
nated respectively gold, silver or paper money
âall National debts being payable in either at
the option of the Government.
2. as the United States is a free and power
ful Nation, and the financial and industrial
liberty of its citizens should be independent of
the action of any other Government, we de
mand the free and unlimited coinage ot gold
and silver by the United States at their present
legal ratio of 16 to 1, without reference to the
course of any foreign nation.
3. We demand that all National banks be
abolished, and in lieu of them that the Gov
ernment establish a postal bank in each city,
town and village of the United SUtes contain
ing a population of 1000 or more.
These banks shall receive deposits of money
from tha people for safe-keeping.
Through them the Government shall trans
mi i money from place to place by the medium
of postal exchange, issued and secured by Na
tional authority.
4. Being opposed to all interest bonas, we
demand that Congress authorize the Govern
ment to loan money to municipal corporations,
or counties containing a population of 5000 or
more in the various States, for the purpose of
public improvement only, and not to exceed
in amount one-third of the asessed valuation
of the taxable property in each municipality
or county.
The sum charged to be prepaid shall not
exceed the actual cost of issuing the loan, and
all loans so made shall be repaid in install
ments, each installment not to exceed 4 per
cent of the sum borrowed.
The gross sum so loaned to municipalities and
counties by the Nation shall not at anytime
exceed thewmountof $40 per capita of the
entire population of the United States.
5. We demand that Congress declare that all
contracts and judgments requiring the pay
ment of money shall be payable at the option
of the aebtor in any lawful money of the
United States.
Such law shall declare void every provision
inserted in any such contract^ or judgment
which requires payment thereunder in any
specified coin.
TRANSPORTATION.
Secondâ l. We demand that th* National
Government own and operate the railroads for
the benefit of the people, and to accomplish
that purpose a department of transportation
shall be organized, and through it the Govern
ment shall acquire or build a system of rail
roads commensurate with the public needs.
2. We demand that the Government shall
own and operate the telegraphs and telephones
of the country as a part of the postal system.
LAND.
Thirdâ l. Land, air, water and sunshine are
the requisites of all human life and the nat
| ural sources of all our wealth, and being ore
; ated by no man are intended by God as gifts
; for all, and henc* they should not be held for
; speculative purposes. Thereiore, in order to
decrease ana finally destroy land monopoly,
we demand that land held in private owner
ship shall bÂ« classified, and the owner thereof
be compelled to pay a graduated tax rated
upon the value of tne holding.
2. All lanas now held by railroads or other
; corporations in excess of their actual needs
I and all lands now owned by aliens shall be re
: Claimed by the Government upon just recom
pense and held only for actual settlers, alien
ownership being prohibited.
DIRECT LEGISLATION.
Fourthâ The peopie have the right 10 de
clare their will on all domestic policies of the
Government or upon all treaties with foreign
nations, and therefore we demand that the
>ational constitution be Â»o amended as to
provide for action therein by direct legisla
tion.
RKBOLT7TIONS.
We, the People's party, express our views
?i?Â°V,, Questions and policies embraced in
the following resolutions, but do not regard
them so urgent for immediate adoption as wo
ao our fundamental principles on finance,
transportation, land and direct legislation, as
above stated.
Upon all the subjects named in these resolu
tions we will act as early as expediency may
CIVIL SERVICE.
1. We believe that in each and all of the de
partment* of the Government a civil service
system should be at once adopted, thereby
mak'ng the appointment to any Federal em
ployment, save in the heads of such depart
ment-, depend upon fitness and good charac
ter, and continuing the tenure thereof upon
the same term;:.
CORPORATE MONOPOLIES.
2. In order to abolish the evils of corporate
monopolies now used for private profit we de
clare that every enterprise, in the form of a
public utility which requires the aid of the
sovtreign power of eminent domain or taxa
tion thouid be owned by the Government or
State or city affected and operated by it for
the benefit of all the people.
INCOME TAX.
3. Under our present system the greater part
of the idle and interest-bearing wealth of the
country escapes a just taxation, and we there
fore believe in an amendment of the constitu
tion which shall give to Congress the power to
enact a law levying a graduated tax on the in
comes of all persons residing or corporations
operating in the United States.
TARIFF.
4. In view of the constant agitation of the
questions involved in tariff legislation and the
unsettled condition of business arising there
from, aud until a more direct, cheaper and
just system shall be devised for raising
National revenues, we believe that Congress
should create a non-partisan tariff tribunal
with its members selected from the different
States and annually reporting its action to
Congress for general information.
That within sixty days after the final
passage of the general appropriations by Con
gress such tribunal shall fix the rates of duty
to be collected upon imports and determine
the goods subject thereto to as to raise the
amount of money required to pay the annual
appropriations so authorized and yearly to pay
one-twentieth of the National debt.
All tariffs shall be so framed by the tribunal
ana enforced so as to prevent the formation of
combinations which, for their own profit, re
duce the wages of labor and enhance the prices
of products.
Protection to American citizens in general
and not to any class or section shall be a car
dinal rule in me selection of the subjects of
duty and the rates imposed.
ELECTION OF PRESIDENT AND SENATORS, ETC.
5. The fundamental principle of oar Gov
ernment is that its powers are derived from
the consent of the governed, and therefore we
believe that the* constitution of the United
states should be so amended that the Presi
dent and Vice-President sha.l be elected by a
direct vote of the whole people, and that each
Federal Senator be elected by the direct vote
of the people of his State.
We further favor an amendment that, if a
proposed general law of Congress shall be
vetoed by the President or declared invalid by
the Supreme Court it shall then be submitted
to a popular vote and, if approved, it shall be
come a law.
PENSIONS.
6. We are In favor of granting liberal pen
sions to all ex-Union soldiers and sailors who
were in active service in the war of the Rebel
lion and who were disabled therein or have
since become so by sickness or old age.
MONROE DOCTRINE.
7. The Monroe doctrine should be main
tained as the permanent policy of the Govern
ment, and it should be so enforced that no Eu
ropean, Asiatic or other foreign power can
hereafter acquire any territory in North or
South America.
In consonance with this idea our Govern
ment should proceed at once to build the Ni
caragua canal, and own and operate it for the
peopie, and to the exclusion of every private
person or corporation.
ISSUANCE OF GOVERNMENT RONDS.
8. We denounce as unconstitutional in law,
and ns unjust in morals, the acts of the ad
ministration in issuing bonds, whereby, in
times of peace, there has been added to the
National debt, in principal and interest, many
millions of dollars.
To prevent further action in this direction
we believe that Congress should prohibit the
Secretary of the Treasury trom issuing any
bonds of the United States, except when ex
pressly so authorized by a law fixing the
amount and purpose thereof.
FUNDING BILL.
9. We are uncompromisingly opposed to
any legislation which proposes to give to the
Pacific railroad corporations ati extension of
time in which to pay to the Government the
debts due from them, and eacb of them; and
we hereby denounce as vicious the act Known
as the Pacific railroad fundinar bill.
The-Government should enforce on maturity
the collection of all debts, principal and in
terest, due it from these companies.
IMMIGRATION.
10. Congress should exclude all foreign
immigration which directly or indirectly com
petes with the American laborer; and in order
to accomplish this we are in favor of a law re
quiring an educational qualification in all
immigrants and levvinga per capita tax on
them, payable to the Federal treasury.
CUBAN INDEPENDENCE.
11. Our sympathy is due to the struggling
patriots of Cuba, and we believe that our
Government should extend to them belligerent
rights.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
12. The right to vote ought to be based
upon intelligence, without regard to sex, and
hence we believe that the elective franchise
should be granted to women on like terms as
to men.
CONTINUANCE OF SETTLED POLICIES.
13. We firmly believe that as the right of
Three Populists Who Drafted the Platform That Will Be Submitted to the Natio nal Convention at
St. Louis by the California Delegation.
self-preservation belongs to the Nation, it may
control or stop immigration; that the public
school system should be generously supported
and extended, so th.it no citizen can remain
ignorant; that taxation should be limited
solely to public uses and never devoted to sec
tarian purposes, and that to preserve the natu
ral right of every citizen to the free exercise
of his religion the church and the state should
be kept forever separate.
Fellow-citizens, hear us : Beneath the stars
and stripes our land proudly stands, with its
resources unmeasured, capable of supporting
in abundance the whole human race of fifteen
hundred mill'ons of people.
In contrast with this possible plenty you
find poverty and misery everywhere and our
70,000,000 of population, figuratively, iv the
ashes of desolation.
Beneath that same banner there are 15,000,
-000 laborers endowed with every capacity
and skill and furnished with marvelous ma
chinery, thus under just conditions equal to
providing food, clothing, comfort and educa
tion in fullness for all.
In contrast with this happiness, naturally
born of equality and justice, you find an in
solent moneyed' plutocracy, a law-breaking
railroad syndicate and a domineering land
monopoly which are debauching all public
service, and swiftly reducing our once free
yeomanry to serfdom and vagabondage.
What are the causes of this poverty and
criminality?
There can be but one answer.
Our laws bring these criminal discrimina
tions and soul-crushing burdens.
These are the statutes and policies of the

DUNN'S INTERESTING FIGURES
Show a Wonderful Deficiency in the
Assessments of the Large
Corporations.
The Supervisors met yesterday morning
â¢s a Board of Equalization, with Taylor in
the chair. There were present also, King,
Benjamin, Scully, Morgenstern, Dimond,
"Wagner, Hughes and Dunker.
Representatives from the local banks
told their tales of woe to the board and
prayed for reductions in their assessments.
Various pleas were â the money as
sessed was out of the State, or if it was
in the banks ft belonged to somebody
Â«lse. The absurdity of supposing that the
taxpayers will ultimately benefit to any
extent by raising the assessments of the
banks was unwittingly shown by one of
the bank representatives when toe declared
that? the banks would have to make good i
the extra taxes tney had to pay by charg
ing the people higher interest.
The Mutual Electric Light Company |
petitioned to have the $50,000 for franchise
Assessed against it stricken from the roll
on the ground that the company actually
had no franchise or special privileges,
having been formed regularly under the
laws of the State.
The assessment of the Market-street
Railway Company was to have come up
for consideration, but no representative of
the company was present, owing to Clerk
Russell's failure to notify the corporation.
Andy Clunie, who wants the company's
assessment raised from $4,000,000 to $13 -
000,000, was all ready.
Thomas I. Bergin appeared before the
board to ask that $1,434,257 be stricken
from the Nevada Bank's assessment of
$2,030,616 on the. ground that the property j
in question was not in this State on the j
first Monday in March, 1896, but was in
"Wisconsin and Illinois.
The protest of the California Safe De
posit and Trust Company was next taken
up. Attorney Booth, representing the com
pany, claimed that the assessment of the
company's vaults as personal property for
$50,000 was illegal because the vaults were
a part of the building. Moreover, $91,906
of the total assessment of $469,701 was out
of me State on the first Monday in March,
deposited in various Eastern banks.
William S. Woods, representing the
' Crocker - Woolworth National Bank,
wanted the bank's entire personal prop
erty assessment stricken out because it -
was assessed to the bank and not to the
shareholders."
Sidney V. Smith, appearing in behalf of
the Bank of British Columbia, wished the
bank's assessment of $2,155,250 to be re
duced by $1,475,760, which the bank owed
to bona fide residents of the State. A
large portion of the money assessed,
Smith declared, was money belonging to
other branches of the banks and merely
happened to be in the bank for a few days
at the time of assessment. The money,
not being used by the bank, should, he
argued, not be taxed.
Incidentally Mr. Smith made a protest
against the raising of the assessments of
the banks of the City. If the present high
assessments are allowed to stand, he de
clared, a number of the banks will have to
suspend. "Besides," he said, '-it will in
iure the people, for. of course, when the
banks have to pay more taxes they must
pet their money back from the people.
The business community is, therefore, in
danger. '
A strong delegation from the Pacific
Coast Savings Society appeared to protest
against an assessment of $65,000, which
they did not have, and which, even if they
did have it, they would owe to their de
positors. The corporation was practically
a building and loan association, and .the
excessive assessment would work a great
hardship. Vincent Neale and Wendell
Easton both declared that the original
statement they had riled was true and
just, and wished to have it left unchanged.
'he matter was taken under advisement.
This afternoon at 1 o'clock the protests
of some sixty or seventy small property
owners will be beard, and on Friday sev
eral other banks will be given a hearing.
Attorney^ will argue for the raising
of the railroad company's assessment on
Saturday morning at 11, and in the after
noon the Grand Jury's report on the As
sessor's valuations" will be considered.
Owing to -the rush of business the board
â will be unable to complete Its labors this
week, so a resolution was passed yesterday
requesting of the State Board twenty days'
additional time in which to hear protests.
Foreman Maskey of the Grand Jury has 1
submitted the following interesting com
munication to the Board of Equalizers in
regard to the assessments made by Mr.
Biebe: â¢ \ . . .
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors, act
ing as the Board of Equalization, in the City and
County of Han Francisco â Gentlemen.: The
Grand Jury of the City and County of San
Francisco, having made investigation in the
matter of the assessments of the property of
some of the principal corporations doing busi
ness in this City, herewith most respectfully
present to you the report of the same. .
Mem.â property shall be assessed for its
full cash value, or what it would be taken in
exchange for a solvent debt.*'
This must be the valuation on the first Mon
day in March. Value can be arrived at by evi
dence; that is to say, market value obtainable
by noting the latest sales, rents, incomes and
other indications of value applied to all prop
erty.
I lAs to real estate we find In San Francisco and
other counties of the State the assessors have
most generally arrived at value in the way
specified above, and we presume to cover the
contingency of forced sales which foreclosure
or forced exchange create have adopted a rule
which they follow after all of the above evi
dence has been obtained of assessing property
for 50 or 60 per cent. r â  ."Â«â '. .. ,
This rule when general works equally for all
and is just in consequence ana seems to follow
the law as strictly as required because the ex
perience of real estate buyers and sellers at
the time of present considerationâ viz. March
2, 1890â will not uphold a price above 50 or 60
per cent forced realization.
We cannot, therefore, discover any injustice
to any citizen in a general adaptation of this
rule, which custom has made, and we believe
law would equitably uphold, and it is assess
ing property nearly as practical for Its full
value or what it would be ' taken in exchange
for a solvent debt. â¢ â¢ .
Corporations â Their saleable conditions
being about the same, we see no reason
in not following the above rule in
arriving at their proper valuation. Take as
evidence the market value of the stock on the
first Monday of \ March. 'Add the market of
bond*, if any are issued, ; 50 per cent of the
total being the assessable value- of the.; com
pany, as the law directs, this kind of property
must be assessed separately as personal prop
erty and real estate, the remainder being the
vaiue of the franchise. By comparing Mr.
sieDe a estimate with the accompanying mem
oranaa, it will be seen that in assessing corpora
v tV fl e has not followed the above rule,
ill 1 vlBv 18 ma<le a class assessment not equal, as
the burden of taxation would rest unduly
upon the taxable property. Resperrully sub
mitted. Fka>k Maskey,
_ _ Foreman Grand Jury.
fean Francisco, July 15, ig96.
The following figures constitute the
memoranda referred to in Foreman
Ma?key s letter, and have been obtained
after exhaustive research by Horace P.
Dunn, the expert employed by the Grand
Jury. The corresponding figures in each
column show respectively the valuations
as juven by the Assessor and as determined
by taking merely 50 per cent of the value
of the property as shown by the stock and
bonds. In nearly every case it will be seen
the assessed value is far below even one
half of the value on the stock and bonds:

' Some interesting disclosures are ex
pected on Saturday morning, when the
I Market-street Company's assessment will
come up for consideration. Quite a num
ber of items, or rather omissions of items,
will probable be inquired into. For in
stance, the Market-street 1 Company failed
to include in its assessment list any cables,
which other roads are assessed for at the
rate of $2500 apiece. This and many
other similar matters will probably be
thoroughly investigated.

its inspection of Chinatown a few days
ago, that that quarter is in need of
a thorough and immediate cleaning and
fumigation if the public health is to be
preserved and the danger of some terrible
epidemic entirely obviated.
The quarter was in better condition
when the members of the board visited
it than it ever was before or since, owing
to the fact that an inspection was ex
pected, but even at that the officials saw
enough to horrify them and produce a
feeling of fear for the public safety.
The matter came up at a meeting of the
board yesterday and Dr. Lovelace made a
strong plea lor the immediate attention of
the board. He stated that it would re
quire the co-operation of the police and
lire departments as well as the Chinese
Consul to make the cleaning thorough
and asked permission of the board to ad
dress them on the subject. He was author
ized to send tne following communica
tion:
Ban Francisco, July 15. 189 G.
Dennis Sulliran Esq., Chief of the Fire Depart
ment, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir: Tbe Board
of Health of this City desires the co-operation
of the Police and Fire Departments in the
abatement of the nuisance in "Chinatown,"
so called, that at this season of the year
threatens to engender contagious diseases, and
â with this view desires a conference at tbe
office of the Board of Health in the New City
Hall with yourself, the Chief of- Police and the
Chinese Consul at the earliest opportunity.
Yours very truiv, A. S. Lovelack, M.D.,
Health Officer.
Copies were sent to the Chief of Police
and Chinese Consul and a conference will
be held at an early date. He was also
authorized to send the following com
munication to the Spring Valley Water
Company :
San Francisco, July 14. 1896.
To the Board of Directors <>f the Sp,ing Valley
Water Companyâ Dear Sirs: Tue summer
season, as you know, is the period when there
is the greatest danger to the residents of this
City from diseases originating in the foul con
dition of our sewers.
There are a few points in such sewers spe
cially apt to breed such contagious and epi
demic diseases, and as the Board of Health
has no appropriation for flushing sewers, and
as the citizens are now suffering from a long
continued financial and business depression,
aud the situation is one in which those inter
ested in the City's welfare should aid our
efforts to safeguard the public health, we have
made bold to ask of your company a contri- '
bution of water sufficient for this purpose dur- i
-^-u-^-^-^-^^-^ - NEW TO-DAT.

Oh for the days of old when men lived nearer to nature; when men
were men !
â¢n .We have civilization and we've gained muchâ but we have also lost
" much! ... .
Dr. Sweeney, the great specialist, is doing; more for the . improvement
of society than a hundred preachers.
For those men who have been in the depths of degradation and miseryâ .
..-.. their mind and body wrecked by excess and vice, unlit, lifeless branches of
, the social treeâ such men become apostles for good and for saving youth
and innocence when once they have been lifted up to health and vigor by
expert medical skill, made once more men among men, entitled to the love '
and respect of their fellow-beings, able to fight life's battles and enjoy its >
pleasures.- .
;>;.. And such men there are thousandsâ men who look upon ; this famous
. specialist as almost something more than a human being.

Receiver Cox Appeals.
Richard T. Cox. receiver of the First Na
tional Bank of Arlington, Or., filed a writ of
error in the Circuit Court of Appeals yester
day in the action against J. L. Robinson
brought in the District Court of Washington
to recover $3,833 23, and which was decided
in the latter's favor. It seems that prior to
the failure of the Arlington bank it secured
judgment against one N. Cecil of Gilliam
County, Or., for the amount named above.
Robinson stepped in and assumed the debt,
thus releasing Cecil's property. Shortly after
this the bank went under, and the receiver
brought suit to recover the amount named in
the old Cecil claim, and for which Robinson
had become responsible. The latter offset the
claim of the bank by one against it, and in
the District Court of Washington won out.
Receiver Cox now flies a writ of error, al
leging, first, insufficiency of evidence to justify
the verdict, ancJ, second, that the verdict ia
against the law.
ASKS A BIG REDUCTION.
The Market-Street Railway Says
Its Assessment Is Too
High.
The Board of Equalization Is Asked
to Cut Off Over Three
Millions.
The Market-street Railway Company
sent a protest to the Board of Equalization
yesterday against the valuation placed on
its property by the Assessor. Mr. Siebe
placed a valuation of $4,245,700 on the
holdings of the corporation, of which
$2,500,000 was on its franchise and $1,745,Â«
700 on personal property, including the
roai itself. The petition asks that the
assessment be reduced by 13,061,900, and is
in part as follows:
Your petitioner avers that the valuation
fixed by said Assessor, nearly $30,000 per
mile, is excessive and out of proportion to the
cash value of said property, as it is under our
statutes made and provided, inasmuch as your
; peUtlonei owns the iron ties and fastenings
only of sakt railways having no title to the
roadway and roadbed, which are on and apart
of the public streets and the property of the
City and County of San Francisco. The cash
valut'of said property on the first Monday of
March last did not exceed the following
amounts, to wit: 51 13-100 miles of single
track, operated by electric railway, $511,300;
twelve mile* not operated by electric railway,
$120,000; 5."> 25-100 miles, operated by cabie
j railway, $552,500.
The franchise is claimed by the com
pany to be of nominal value find to be
covered by the valuation placed on the
personal property of the corporation.

RESULTS OF ORGANIZATION.
At the annual meeting of the San Francisco
Fruit Exchange President Dal ton, in calling at
tention to the benefits resulting to tbe fruit-grower
from organization, said that the system of stan
dards adopted by the exchange had served to edu
cate the East up to an nncerstandingof ihe merits
of choice and fancy California fruit. Had It not
been tor ihis acion on ttie part of the exchange
the real excellence of our best dried fruits would
never have been known in the East. Another
good result was the securing from the southern
Pacific lla'.lroad of an equally low rate on canned
fruit Eastward to that enjoyed by Southern Cali
fornia, which could never have been accomplished
by an individual.
EXPORTS OF PRODUCE.
Exports of produce and merchandise from this
port during the first six months of 1896 were $15,-
S'>7,ooo. against $13,613,000 for the same period
In 1-P5. This is the best showing since ihe panic
of 1893. There is .1 gain of $104,000 with tne
Hawaiian Islands. $3H7,400 with Japan. $18-4 ,000
with Central America, $326,000 with Siberia and
$1,631,700 with Australa. The $509,600 to
South Africa is entirely new business.
Explanation. .
The arrow flies with the wind. . The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. . Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln a of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hitrh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompHnied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the Interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. , The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

1 CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. July 16.â There was . a re
versal in the situation In the wheat market to-day,
the bears assuming control at the opening, backed
by the continued decline in stocks at New York.
The sudden illness of Cornelius VanderbU was a
factor In the depression of railway securities and
the Chicago wheat pit reflected it, -'as a mirror held
up to na tire." The market opened at the "pat"
price and rallied soon afterward. Cables were not
very responsive to yesterday's advance. Wheat
was sold freely by the local Interests. Receipts in
the Northwest indicated a falling off, 278 cars ar
riving, against 438 cars last Wednesday and 121
cars on the same day a year ago.
The receipts at Chicago were 107 cars and the
withdrawals from store were 65,800 bushels.
Liverpool cables were steady ana Vid higher.
Atlantic seaboard clearances for twenty -four hours
weie 309,767 bushels. Continental cables were
firmer and a shade higher. The market was firm
in the last ten minutes on reported working off of
201,000 bushels, but the trading was light, and
local September wheat opened from 665/g@r>6V4c,
sold between 566/Bfa.s6s.ic and 56c, closing at
66V4C %c. under yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow, 260 cars,
CORNâ Dipped at the opening on the weakness
of securities and on the decline In wheat- The
recommendation of local freight agents that east
bound rates be restored to 20c also had an ef
fect. The market soon strengthened on cooler
weather reports and on the favorable crop bulle
tins. Receipts exceeded the estimates. 203 cars
arriving; while 180 cars were anticipated. With
drawals from store were 66,511 bushels, and this
small amount helped the argument for a de
cline. Liverpool cables were firmer and %d
higher. Export clearances were 234,640 bushels
September corn opened from 28c to 278/1 c. sold
between 28VÂ»c and 27 % c, closing at 273/, c, s/,c
lower than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow, 270 cars.
OATSâ Followed in the footsteps of wheat and
corn, the .New York stock market being used as a
bear argument. A good deal of business .was
transacted in the first hour and a half. Receipts
were 103 cars, and 34,005 bushels were withdrawn
from store. September oats closed %Â®Vic lower
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row, 115 cars.

THAT DISAPPEAR,
Dalton Proves That It Es
caped the Notice of the
State Board.
RYAN'S TEN PETITIONS.
His Corporations Ask That a
Million Bs Taken From
Their Assessments.
HE. MORE-HOUSE TO APPEAR.
All tke State Equalizers Subpenaed
to Come Forward and Make
Explanations.
Oakland Office San Feaxcisco Oall,)
908 Broadway, July 15. \
Assessor Dalton scored one point to-day
against the railroad. The tight being
made by the Southern Pacific is that it is
being assessed twice for the same track in
this county. Mr. Dalton has discovered
that there are 200 miles of track in this
county and the State board assesses only
ninety-six, and he declares he is certainly
entitled to tax the remaining 104. This
statement caused the board to issue sub
penas for all the members of the State
Board of Equalization to explain matters.
No leas than ten applications for reduc
tion of assessments were filed to-day by
E. Black Ryan in behalf of the various
Southern Pacific corporations. They in
cluded the Southern and Central Pacitic
Railroad companies, the Pacific Improve
ment Company and the Oakland Railway
Company (SanPablo and Telegraph ave
nue car lines) which asked for a total re
duction of |1, 404, 615.
Immediately on the board's coming: to
order this morning the clerk read a letter
from C. M. Coglan, clerk of tne State
Board of Equalization. He said the board
would meet next Monday, and as coon as
the request for an extension of ten days'
time was acted upon ne would wire the re
sult. As the matter now stands the Board
of Equalization must make all calculation
upon closing up its business on next Mon
day. No case can be set for bearing after
that until tne request for an extension of
time is granted and that fact cannot now
be ascertained until noon Monday at the
earliest.
Mr. Ryan then tooK the floor and pre
sented his petitions one at a time. He
made his arguments in each case as he
presented it. which took him until nearly
12 o'clock. The first was the Southern
Pacific's assessment upon one-third of a
mile of roadway into the gravel nit at
Nllet, assessed at $300, and one-fourth of a
mile of roadway to a wine cellar at Irving
ton at $400, and a sidetrack at Newark for
$1500. The Central Pacific Company's
case followed. It was assessed for three
and a half miles of railroad and rolling
stock at 1125,000, forty miles of sidetrack
at $60,000, franchise $250,000, Long Wharf
$250,000. .Â« Â -; "â '
rt In taking up the first case Mr. Ryan
said: '*â  "Your petitioner avers that the
State Board of Equalization only has the
power to assess the above property, under
article XII, section 10, of the constitution
of the State of California; that your peti
tioner operates its railroad in more than
one county in the State, to wit, in more
than fourteen counties, and has made re
turn of all the above property to said
board; and said board will assess the same
for the year 1596; that said board has
assessed said property for years past, and
the taxes thereon have been paid."
In denying the right of Mr. Dalton to
assess the Seventh-street line as a separate
line, Mr. Ryan said: "The franchise of
that line has been amalgamated with the
Central Pacific franchise and the city of
Oakland has no control over that line.
That franchise is now extinct."
The request is for a reduction of the
Southern Pacific assessment from $2200 to
$5, and the Central Pacific from $655,000 to
$10, on the above grounds. Continuing,
Mr. Ryan said, -'We offer no objection to
the amount of Mr. Dalton's assessment,
but the State board claims the right to
and has always heretofore assessed this
property, which cannot be doubly as-
Bested. I would rather accept Mr. Dal
ton's figures, personally, for they are less
than the State board assesses us. The real
contention snould be between Mr. Dalton
and the State board."
Then came the petition of the Northern
Hallway Company asking for a reduction
from $115,000 to $10. This is the Berkeley
branch from Snell Mound. Mr. Ryan
made the same claim for exemption as in
the cases before mentioned, In the case
of the ferry depot at the end of the mole
the figures were $150,000 for improvements.
He asked that these be reduced to $85,000
and $7000 respectively, and for evidence as
to their value referred the board to the
testimony in their possession taken last
year of W. S. Palmer, the company's resi
dent engineer. The narrow-gauge depot
was assessed at $45,000, and was only
worth $25,000. The board could see the
testimony of L. Filimore, taken last year.
The Pacific Improvement Company
asked that the assessment of $134,950 on
the undivided interest in a tract of marsh
land equal to 449 89 acres be reduced to
$65,000. This land is situated on the Aia
meda shore of the Oakland harbor along-
Bide the narrow-gauge tracks. The Cen
tral Pacific had about sixty acres of marsh
land over there which the Assessor had
assessed at $300 per acre, making a total of
$18,000. This they asked to have reduced
to $1800. Mr. Kyan said the land was
worth nothing. If he had to improve it
he would not take it for a gift. He" closed
by asking the board to go over and Bee it
themselves.
Assessor Dalton answered these state
ments. He first produced the State
statutes, and turning to section 3665 read:
"Within twenty days after the first
Monday in August the board must appor
tion the total assessment of the franchise,
roadway, rails and rolling-stock of each
railway to the counties, or cities and coun
ties, in which such railway is located in
proportion to the number of miles of rail
way laid in such counties and cities and
counties." He thou that the State
Board of Equalizers should apportion to
Alameda County the taxes on. the entire
length of the road in this county. He held
that the main and side tracks should be
counted in the total. This was against the
stand taken by Ryan, who claimed that
the ninety-six miles assessed was all there
was to assess. -Â<â â 
Mr. Dalton produced the figures of the
State board and submitted them to the
board. They are:

Total assessment in Alameda County,
Mr. Da) ton said he had 200 miles of
track which he could point out to the
board. Supervisor Taicott wanted to
know if the Assessor recommended the
assessment of the untaxed portion.
"Well," he replied, "you have hfty-rJve
miles of it on the books now, and I be
lieve it should stay there."
Supervisor Church moved that the Clerk
be instructed to issue subpenas for f be
members of the State Board of Equaliza
tion and their clerk, requiring their pres
ence in this city next Friday morning at
11 o'clock, to give testimony as to how the
assessments of the railroad company's
tracks are made and to show how Alameda
County only gets an apportionment of
ninety-six miles when there are 200 miles
of track in the county. The resolution
was passed.
Tbe application of the Piedmont cable
line ask 3d for a reduction from $2(51,475
to $79,455. The hearing was set for 2
o'clock Friday. A double assessment is
charged by J". E. Baker of the Alameda
Savings Bank. The money in tbe bant
assessed was deposited in another bank
before the first Monday in March, and had
been paid for by them, hence he should
not be assessed. This was set for to-mor
row morning.
SAVED A LIFE.
The Alameda Klectrlc Line Proves the
Usefulness of Their Fenders
Without a Dummy.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 15.â Tbe Ala
meda electric line has proved the effi
ciency of its fenders and used a two
year-old boy instead of the usual dummy.
The boy is still alive and in no wise in
jured, to which the company points with
pride and claims its fenders the best in
use.
TGis afternoon little Harry Brown of
Alameda was playing on the street. Not
noticing an approaching car ne ran across
tbe tracks of the electric line directly in
front of car 19 and was knocked down.
The spectators expected the usual fatal
result, but were greatly surprised to see
the fender piCK tbe child up and carry him
along without a scratch. The car was
soon stopped and the boy taken out.

SAN LORENZO ELOPERS,
Farmer Lavin of the County
Infirmary Weds Mamie
Ross.
Told No One of Their Intention and
Cau-e a Short-Lived Social
Sensation.
Oakland Office San Francibco Call,)
908 Beoadway, July 15. J
The quiet little town of San Lorenzo is
busy discussing an elopement. One of its
fairest belles named Mamie Ross disap
peared Monday afternoon. As San Lo
renzo is like one large family the loss of
one of its members is at once the business
of the whole community.
Next morning it was also discovered
! that Thomas Lavin of San Leandro was
; missing. Lavin is the farmer employed
I at the County Infirmary, and is a very
i industrious, steady young man. It was
j known that he had made a feÂ«v calls on
( Miss Ross, but a marriage was not anticipa
| ted. Both parties live with their respective
j mothers and are highly respected.
Tuesday morning the news was received
that Mr. and Mrs. Lavin were living at
the groom's mother's house in San
Leandro. They had met in Oakland and
were quietly married and no one's consent
was asked.
Monday night Miss Ross' big brother
went on a â¢â  unt in a mood that boded no
good to any one who might cross him.
He came home late, but refused to talk,
and it is supposed that he discovered the
elopement and thought he had better keep
his bands off.
Mrs. Ross said to-night that Mamie is
in good hands and that her only grievance
is that she was not asked to give her con
sent.
All parties concerned will bury the
hatchet in a few days and San Lorenzo's
ephemeral sensation will be but a memory.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1896.
LUDLOW TESTS
MEETS FATE,
Nature Proves That He
Will Be the Next
President
MAKES A UNIQUE TEST.
The Master Car- Repairer's Faith
in Flowers Cannot Be
Shaken.
WAS ENCOURAGED BY BRYAN.
McKinl^y's Name Grew One Inch
When the Democrat c Nomina
tion Was Made.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, July 15. )
One of tbe most original tests of the
chances of William McKinley has been
Master Car-Repairer Ludlow's Test, Which He Declares Has Settled the FatÂ© of
McKinley.
| made by Master Car Repairer Ludlow of i
the Southern Pacific. Mr. Ludiow said to- ;
day that the result of the test proves that
the Ohio mau will assuredly be the next
President.
Mr. Ludlow places great faith in nature.
He believes that any question askea her
will be truthfully answered. His method
of procedure is somewhat unique, but he
I insists that it is logical and based upon
correct conclusions.
When McKinley was nominated. Mr.
Ludlow was anxious to know whether his
election was certain. The man who has
repaired all the cars of the great corpora
tion for an ordinary lifetime is a pro
nounced protectionist. He was very en
thusiastic over McKinley and when the
St. Louis nomination was made he could j
nÂ«t patiently wait to know what next '
November would produce. He decided to j
consult nature.
As soon as his day's work was done Mr. j
Ludlow prepared a section of his garden
and marked out the word "McKinley". in ,
trenches. Into these he sowed alternan- j
thera seeds and all around it he planted ,
green moss.
He then muttered some incantations and *
j said, "if he is to be elected, those seeds
; will all start up and the name of the next
' President will soon appear in red on a i
green background."
In a few days the young plants shot
through the soil and looked healthy.
"When the Chicago convention met," said
Mr. Ludlow to-day, "they seemed to hesi-
I tate and I was somewhat despondent about 'â 
! the success of my man. When, however i
the Democrats fairly got down to business j
and the free silver shouts reached the j
West, the plants lifted their heads. When
I went to look at them on the morning
after the nomination of Bryan I saw they
had grown nearly an inch in the night.
"I consider that these facts augur most
favorably, and I feel confident of success
i for my candidate. I know I am right.
; You can always depend upon nature to dp
the proper thing at the proper time."
Then Mr. Ludlow told a little story of i
how he had used a plant to get the truth j
out of a boy employed at the railroad
shops. "It was a sensitive plant," said
| Mr. Ludiow. "and after the boy had told
ime his story I said : 'Now, touch that
plant, and if yWve told the truth it will
remain as it is; if you've lied, the plant
J will ail shrivel up.' He touched it, the
i plant shriveled up, and he thereupon told
ime the truth. The plant is of the same
[ kind that are in the park conservatory.
That, however, was a joke on nature, but
my McKinley test is thoroughly reliable."
The McKinley garden was thriving
eloriously to-day. "If I did not vote for
McKinley after that," said Ludlow, "I
should be worse than an infidel."
FIRE IN BERKELEY.
Job Hatfield's Home Burned to the
Ground.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 16 â The house
of Job Hatfield, a contractor employed in
San Francisco, situated high up in the
hills behind Berkeley, was burned to the
ground this evening.
The fire was discovered about 7 o'clock,
and an alarm was at once turned in at the
Columbia Fire Company. It wa? impossi
ble to reach the scene with the fire appar
atus, however, and the firemen confined
their efforts to saving furniture.
The tire was first observed by Mrs. Hat
field, who found the basement of the
dwelling full of smoke. Ascending the
stairs she discovered that the flames had
already reached the upper stories, and all
efforts to contest their progress were un
avaihng.
It is thought that an oil stove was the
cause of the tire.
Mr. Hatlield's residence was at the cor
ner of Cedar street and Bonte avenue. It
was valued at $1500 and was partially in
sured. The dwelling was occupied by Mr.
and Mrs. Hatrield and their children" who
spent the night after the fire with a neigh
bor.

RAMMED THE BRIDGE.
Webster-Street Draw Saved by
the Liberal Use of a
Hatchet
The Paul and Willie Breaks Adrift.
A Big Barge in the Way of
Navigation.
Oakland Office Pak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 15. j
This was an unlucky day for shipping
on the estuary. As thefschooner Mary
Bnhne was trying to dock at Webster
street wharf she started a seriea of acci
dents that left the schooner Paul and
Willie a helpless wreck, threatening de
struction to tbe drawbridge.
The Paul and Willie was leaving the
wharf as the Mary Buhne approached.
Somehow the two craft locked booms and
the Mary liuhne plowed along the rail of
the Paul and Willie, leaving destruction
in her wake. The iatter's boom was
snapped off and her mooring being loos
ened she drifted fast down on to the Web
ster-street drawbridge.
The punch she gave tbe bridge disturbed
the tender and he climbed upon the bridge
and created a dramatic scene with a
hatchet. He knew that a few good drives
would destroy the bridge and throw him
out of a job, so he vigorously chopped
away at the schooner's stays and when he
was through nothing was left standing but
the masts. The Mary Buhne got off
easily and docked in safety.
A large barge broke away from its moor
ings this afternoon and floated on the tide
through the drawbridge. It was right in
the way of the large ship Craigmore that
was towing out, and a collision was only
averted by Charles Chambers, watchman
at. the Adams wharf. Chambers and two
companions worked for two hours towing
I tbe barge to a place of safety and they
I declare that unless they are recompensed
I they will claim the barge for salvage.
Louis Porter Beleased.
OAKLAND. Cal., July 15.â Louis Porter
has been released from tbe Stockton
asylum. He was committed several
months ago for attempting a harrangue
and the drawine of a revolver in the First
Unitarian Church.
John P. Irish and others captured and
disarmed him, when he was taken to the
Citj Prison. It caused considerable ex
citement in the church, which was
crowded.
AFTER THE PROPRIETOR.
The Plant of the Observer Dis
appeared During the
Night.
Foreman Ball He.d an Assignment
of It to Pay the
Printers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Calx,)
908 Broadway, July 15. j
The Observer was not published this
morning. Seven weeks ago the paper was
born in the night. It came into existence
on the eve of the awarding of the city
printing contract. It had to be out on a
certain morning in order to bid. Type
was distributed at night, a press was pro
cured after dark and printers were enticed
out of their beds to get out the new paper.
Everything was successful, and next
morning every householder in the center
of the city found the Observer on his door
step.
It disappeared last night Ever since
its birth the "ghost" of the Observer has
been of a very intermittent character.
Thinps got so cramped on Monday
that the printers were paid with the fol
lowing check:
Oakland, July 13, 1896.
I hereby assign all my right, title and inter
est in and to the Observer to Thomas M. Ball
in consideration of wages due the compositors
employed thereon. This assignment includes
all the material and paraphernalia use&in
the publication and printing of said Observer.
Frank H. Robinson,
Publisher and proprietor The Observer.
Witness:
A. F. Eldridge,
F. J. Gregory.
Yesterday morning the money was to
have been paid, but as it was not on hand
the printers were the owners of the plant.
When they went to the office this morn
ing they found that a large part of the
plant had been removed during the night.
Ball at once concluded that Robinson had
taken the material and this alternoon he
swore nut a warrant for Robinson's arrest
for grand larceny.
The paper has been runnine behind ever
since it started and when Robinson's bid
for the city printing was not accepted the
crisis came.
"Frank Robinson broke into that office
and carried away those lorms," said Mr.
Ball this morning, "and I will make it
hot for him. When he made that assign
ment to me there was a chattel mortgage
on the property, and, unless I am greatly
mistaken, we can put him through for
that. It is* just Dossible that the Prosecut
ing Attorney may be correct about the
burglary business, but the property is
worth $500, und I think that amounts to
grand larceny."
The city editor of the Observer said to
night that the paper will be published in
another office, in accordance with a con
tract recently ma<le.
Frank Robinson, proprietor of the Ob
server, was arrested to-night on a charge
of grand larceny sworn to by Thomas
Ball.
"This is a cinch job of my printers," he
said, "because they learned that 1 was go
ing to have my printing done on ma
chines. They agreed on a special rate
and now they want the whole thing. The
assignment 1 made was not legal, anyhow.
I got out my paper to-day so as to save my
legal advertising, and I expect to get
bonds in a short time and be at work
under different conditions to-morrow."
THROWN FROM A WAGON.
H. F. Freeze, a Dairyman, and a Little
Girl rain fully Injured.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 15.â H. F. Freeze,
a dairy produce dealer, living at Nine
teenth street and Broadway, had a narrow
escape from death this evening. He was
driving home, and on descending the hill
in Hayes Canyon, near town, he applied
the brake, as his team was slipping.
The connections broke and the horses
ran away, throwing Freeze out and break
ing his left leg and right arm. He had a
little girl with dim bringing her to town,
and she was thrown out and her left leg
broken. Freeze was taken homo by a
passer-by, and the girl's father, a Mr. Hen
den, was notified. He at once brought his
daughter to a physician. Freeze was
brought to the Receiving Hospital, and
aiter being cared for he returned home.
SAYS SHE WILL SHOOT,
Mrs, Woods, the Rawhider,
Greatly Incensed With
the Doctor.
The Marital Troubles Are of Long
Standingâ The Wife's Stories
of Cruelty and Neglect.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 15.â "1 will
shoot him as surely as I am alive if he at
tempts to steal any of my children again."
This is the defiant remark which Mrs.
Dr. Woods of Berkeley made of her di
vorced husband to-night to a Call corre
spondent. It was only a few days ago
that she horsewhipped him, as she says,
at her house, where he had come to pay a
visit to his children, according to the per
mission granted him by the Superior Court
at the time of the divorce proceedings.
"He did not come merely to see the
children and pay a fatherly call," said tne
incensed little woman, "but to steal them
away from me. He has my only boy now
with him, but if he steals another of my
children he will do so at the peril of his
miserable life."
The story of the Woods difficulty is an
old one, and has been a subject for
freauent comment in the neighborhood of
Ashby and Telegrapti avenues for many
months past. Mrs. Woods nas a pitiful
tale to tell of unwonted cruelty to herself
and oiiildrer. by her husband, and she has
not the least scruples about making them
known. Twice have Woods and his wife
been divorced, and consequently their do
mestic troubles have extended through
years, ns their eldest child is now about
seventeen.
The tide of affairs runs smoothly be
tween them for a time and then a storm
arises which stirs the wrath of both, but
more particularly that of the wife, as she
claims that she is in absolute poverty and
need and lives in a small, lonely cot, while
he ii a well-to-do insurance man with a
mansion for his dwelling-place.
"I have three children left," said she;
"girls that I love more dearly than my
self, and when I see how luxuriously he
lives with the boy he has stolen from my
bosom, and at the same time I, myself,
and ray three girls living in dire need, it
makes my blood within me boil.
'â¢1 cannot bÂ«-gin to express the degree of
cruelty and disgrace he has heaped upon
me, but there is one thing certain, he will
get riddled through and through if he
tries to induce another of my children to
leave me."
Two Runaway Accidents.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 15.â Two run
away accidents took place to-day in Berke
ley, in both of which the occupants of the
vehicles narrowly escaped death.
This morning, while Dr. F. H. Payne
was about to step into his buggy, "the
horse started to run and dragged the
doctor, who held on to the reins, for a
considerable distance, severely bruising
him about the head and shoulders.
A short time afterward Charles Hoppe
and Fred Boegle, both of tbe junior class
at the university, were thrown from their
buggy near the postoffice, in which acci
dent Hoppe received a severe wound on
the leg, while Boegle escaped uninjured.;
The vehicle was badly demolished, one of
the shafts having been broken and the
wheels sprung.
Canea From Cabbages.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 15.â Samuel
Wakeham, the keeper of a paintstore in j
Berkeley and a 'over of curiosities, has j
found use for the cabbage-stalks which he
is growing in his back yard and will turn
them into walking-canes. Wakeham is j
the man who created considerable noto- j
riety a short time ago through exhibiting
in front of his establishment on Shattuck
avenue a cabbage-stalk twelve feet high, I
grown under his own cultivation." The ;
canes have much the same appearance as
those made of Congo wood, but are not so I
bulky. In color they are much lighter, i
being of a delicate tan hue. Wakeham
expects a big rush after them by curiosity
seekers as soon as college opens.

SIXTY DOLLARS MISSING,
A Bay-Street Druggist Meets a
Gentleman Who Carries
Greenbacks.
The Boys' Brigade Home From Camp.
Harry Lomax's Body Not Yet
Found.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 15.â A peculiar
incident happened at the store of J. R.
Young, druggist, Bay-street station, a few
days ago. A man walked into the store
and bought a toothbrush, tendering a
twenty-dollar bill in payment. At 9
o'clock the same evening the toothbrush
purchaser came back and asked Mr. Young
if he would give him the bill back and
he would give him gold instead. Mr.
Young complied and put the double-eagle
in a box in his kitchen, just off the store.
The man explained he wa s from the East
and preferred paper money, at the same
time exhibiting a roll of bills. He engaged
Mr. Younjr in conversation and obtained a
rubber band from him to keep his bills to
gether.
Mr. Young says he observed two men
standing outside the shop in the evening
while he was talking with the stranger,
and imagines they must have been con
federates of his* because when he went to
get the box containing the $20 and other
money off th# kitchen table he found the
box and its contents â some $60â gone.
The men had gone, also. He is of the
opinion that the men were sneakthieyes
and that the conversation and rechanging
of the bill was simply part of a plan to rob
him.
As he is unable to give any description
of the men, the police have no clew to
work on.
The Boys' Brigade Outing.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 15.â The Ala

WILL AVOID THE
GOLDEN GATE.
The New Japanese Line of
Steamers for
America.
A VERY HEAVY SUBSIDY
Danger That It Will Not Touch
in San Francisco
Bay.
LOCKING FOR A TERMINAL.
Local Railroad Conditions Likely to
Outweigh Natural Advan
tages.
Japan is reaching out for recognition
npon the seas as a mercantile as well as a
naval power. She is going to span tbe
Pacific with a line of her own steamships,
and she is going to compete in the ports of
North America for the tradÂ« of the island
nation.
That there will be a line of steamers has
been decided, but to what port it will run
is an unsettled question. This is being
investigated, however, and before long
directors from the new company will be
over here looking up docking facilities,
depths of water, railroad service, etc This
last item of railroad service will cut an im
portant figure in the selection of the ter
minal point, and for the same reason San
Francisco is not likely to be heard of when
the selection taKes place.
The new company formed is called tbe
Toyo Kisen Kaisba or, in English, the
Occidental Steamship Company. It was j
formed upon the ideas and suggestions of j
the Government, and the Government will
insure a tremendous subsidy to make cer- j
tain its success. The amount of this sub- i
sidy is not actually known, but it is large j
enough to enable the ships to travel empty
to and from tbe Flowery Kingdom, and
still not lose a cent.
The line to America will not be the only
one operated by the new company. There I
will be arumberof steamers put on the j
route through tbe Indian Ocean and the I
Suez Canal to London, but the principal â 
object is first to have the little isfand con
nected by a line of its own with the Amer
ican shore. Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who j
will act as interpreter for the president of |
the company wuen be comes here, arrived
here on the steamer Doric wh n last it |
touched at this port. Since coming to this
City Kobayash: has been collecting such
data as will be of use to him when lie ar
rives. He was before the Harbor Com
mission on Tuesday asking for informa
tion regarding harbor rates, and he has i
been quietly collecting all information
possiole regarding railroad connections.
San Francisco does not stand muc . of a
chance. She has no communication with
the Easi except through tbe Southern Pa
cific lines, and the Southern Pacific has
not given the new line any encouragement.
Six months ago negotiations were opened
with the Southern Pacific, but the repre
sentatives of the new line were given to
understand that no particular concessions
would be allowed. As overland freights
will be one of the big sources of revenue
for the new line this would leave the steam
ship company entirely in tt c hands of the
Southern Pacific, and this position the
Japanese decline to take.
Portland, with its Columbia River bar
and its winding river channel; Seattle, far
to the northward; Victoria, a British
Columbian city; San Diego, with its shal
low fairway and its beds of kelp, and even
Tehuantepec in Mexico, with most meager
but untrammeled communication with
the Eastern markets, all afford superior
advantages to San Francisco, the metropo
lis of ihe West, the finest port on the
shores of the Pacific. The steamers may
stop here incidentally, but the line of
trade between Japan and America will go
north or south â anywhere but through tne
Golden Gate.
Flour is the principal import to Japan.
It comes now over Pacific Mail steamers,
but the Japanese will patronize their own
line. The Pacific Mail can ship through
the Eouthern Pacific overland cheaper
than the new line, so the line will touch
at that port where discrimination is tbe
exception and not the rule. The Japanese
will export an immense amount of goods.
Her factories are but in their iniancy, but
already they are affecting the world's mar
kets. The new line is for the purpose of
bringing them to these markets, but it is
not going to court discrimination by tak
ing them through this port.
When tba cotton factories of Japan
were consuming thousands of bales of
cotton a year an envoy was sent to this
country to find tbe cheapest route for cot
ton from the Eastern States to Japan.
The Southern Pacific and the Pacific Mail
formed tne natural route, but it was found
cheaper to ship to Galveston, then by sea
to New York, then by the Canadian Pa
cific to Vancouver, and then across the
ocean to Japan, tnan to accept the rate
offered by tne Southern Pacific. As the
cotton trade was made to circle around
San Francisco, but not to touch it, so is
the great bulk of the Japanese trade in
danger of going north or eoing south, to
leave San Francisco and its people to com
plain of haid times.
SEARCH WARRANT CASE
Difference of Opinion Between
Judge Campbell and the
Police.
It Has Arisen Because Mrs. E. P.
Ferry Fai ci to Get Her Furni
ture From Auctioneer Flinn.
Judge Campbell's well-meaning efforts
to enable Mrs. E. P. Ferry of 1107 Bush
street to regain possession of her furniture
from Jonn W. Flinn, auctioneer, have
proved futile.
Flinn yesterday morning brought suit in
the Superior Court for the possession of
the furniture, or its equivalent, $1000, and
further asked that he be awarded $1000 dam
ages for the alleged unlawful detention of
the goods. He also sued out a writ of re
plevin to prevent the furniture being re
moved from the store.
The writ was delivered into the hands of
the Sheriff, and while Police Sergeant
Duncan was in Flinn's store checking off
the goods from the inventory attached to
tbe search warrant, before being carted
away to Mrs. Ferry's house by the team
sters who were in waiting, a Deputy Sheriff
appeared aud served the writ and the liti
gation will now be settled in the Superior
Court.
Attorney McGowan, who represents
Mrs. Ferry, hurried to Judge Campbell's
court and complained that through the
negligence and delay of the police the
Judge's order had tot been obeyed and
>frÂ«. Ferry waÃ still withont her turni
ture. He "went so far as to charge collu
sion between Flynn and the police.
The Jndge was angry and said if there
was any legal way to do it be proposed to
punish some one for contempt. Mrs.
Ferry was entitled to her property and it
was a si ame she should be tricked oat
of it
He sent for Sergeant Duncan and the
sergeant gave his explanation. He said
when he reported off duty at 5 o'clock
Tuesday afternoon it was arranged that
he should meet Mrs. Ferry at 7 o'clock
yesterday morning and go to Flinn's
store for the furniture. He met Mrs.
Ferry, but as the search warrant, with the
inventory, had been locked up in Chief
Crowley's desk they bad to wait till the
Chief aVrived, about half past 8 o'clock.
"I received my instructions from the
Chief," said the sergeant, "to cneck every
thing with the inventory attached to the
warrant and be careful that nothing else
was taken away. When we got to tbe
store F'linn's brother was there, and he
said to Mrs. Ferry that he demanded
possession of the furniture from her. She
refused, and then I got a space cleared
and began to check off the furniture and
other effects. While doing so the Deputy
Sheriff arrived."
Chief Crowley said that the police acted
entirely within the scope of their authority
and the Judge had no cause for complaint.
A search warrant should not have been
issued, as it was purely & civil case and
the proper course would have been for
Mre. Ferry to sue out a writ of replevin.
"The Police courts," said the Chief,
"are simply being used as collection
agencies by people to save the cost of a
suit in the civil courts. It entails un
necessary labor and trouble upon the
police and upon the Judges themselves,
which should be avoided."
BIDDING FOR FIGHTERS,
The Occidental and Olympic
Clubs Are Looking for
Big Game.
The National Club Has Some Hopes
of Getting the Maher and
Choynski Mill.
It must amuse Champion Jim Corbett
to read of the controversy that exists be
tween the clubs that are bidding for the
Maher and Choynski mill.
One would imagine that Choynski and
Maher had never suffered defeat and that
they were greater drawing cards than
Corbett, Fitzsimmons et al.
The Olympic and Occidental clubs have
been planning for some days past in the
hope of getting this match, as they have
been granted licenses to give two boxing
entertainments. The National Club
counted upon its chickens before they
were hatched, with the result that the
Supervisors did notapproveof its "brash"
system of transacting business and cut it
off from all chance of holding a contest in
this City and County by refusing it a
license.
Virtually the fight for a ten-round con
! test between Maher and Ohoynski lies
between the Olympic and Occidental
clubs. The former was first in the field,
with a bid of a $4000 purse.
Young Mitchell, who is director-general
of the Occidental Club, does not hesitate
to say 1 1. at Manager Groom of the National
! Club made a grievous mistake when !>e
i offered the fighters a purse of $6000. He
i is of the opinion that tbe Olympic Club
; reached the limit at $4000, but if Maher
! and Choynski will sign articles to box un
! der the auspices of his club he may go a
j few hundreds better if he finds that Maher
i is in anything like fair condition when he
! arrives from the East.
Billy Vice, ticket agent "of the Union
| Pacific Railroad, is a very much tangled
| up young man at present. He sent for
| Maher at the suggestion of the National
: Club's manager, and says that, fight or
' no fight, he will hold tbe club responsible
| for whatever money he will be out of
. pocket in securing the fighter's passage to
! this City.
The whole affair is in a muddle at
J present, and there is very little hope of
I dissolving the tangle until after Maher's
arrival, which will be in tie near future.
Ex-Manager Gibbs of the National Club
| is rusticating at the springs, where he is
| refreshing his bothered Drain matter. He
! writes that the cray stuff will be in splen
j did condition to undergo a severe strain
after his outing in the warm belt, and his
! friends, consequently, expect great feats
! of diplomacy from him on his return to
the City.
Gibbs is a very shrewd and conservative
manager of boxing entertainments and
i the supporters of the game are sanguine
that he will eventually straighten out the
affairs of the National Club, whose ship is
at present foundering on the rocks of per
dition, because of bad Bteering in a fog.
Tbe Olympic Club has made some
changes in its programme of mate es for
j the evening of the 31st inst. It canceled
its engagement of Danny Mahoney and
Joe Sullivan, who are said to be very warm
friends and somewhat delicate about hurt
ing each other's feelings.
Robert McArthur, the champion ama
teur lightweight boxer of the coast, in
formed Superintendent Kennedy yester
day that he was ready and willing to turn
professional and box Dal Kawkins an
eignt-round contest at 135 pounds, but
Hawkins objected to the weight specified
by McArthur and said that he would not
meet the amateur champion unless he
agreed to enter the ring at 133 pounds.
McArthur then said lie would box George
Green at catch weights, and as t:;e last
named boxer is rusticatine at Sonoma
word was immediately forwarded to him
of McArthur's intentions.
A contest between Green and McArthur
would interest every member of the club.
The Olympic Club sent a dispatch to
Peter Maher at Chicago, in care of George
Siler, offering to pay Maher's expenses to
this City if he would consent to mÂ«et
Cuoynski in a ten-round bout under the
auspices of the club for a purse of $4000.

Beautiful Building Purchased
From the Chautauqua
Association.
LAEGE ATTENDANCE EXPECTED
In September the State Spiritualistic
Association Will Meet in
This City.
The spiritualists are going to have s
grand State camp-meeting at Redondo. It
will be the greatest event of the kind ever
planned by followers of that cult in Cali
fornia, and their hearts and sonls are just
bubbling over with enthusiasm at the pros
pect.
In order for such a meeting to be held it
was essential that the various spiritual-

istic bodies of the State should act in
unison. This necessary link in the proceed
ings was supplied by H. D. Barrett, presi
dent of the National Spiritualistic Associa
tion, who welded the scattered organiza
tions together on the occasion of his last
visit to San Francisco. And so tne camp
meeting is assured.
Not only is there going to be a camp
meeting, but it was thought best to have
it in the same pi ace each year; so the
State Camp-meeting Association looked
aoout for a suitable place. They found it
at Redondo.
The handsome artificial stone building
formerly owned by the Chautauqua Asso
ciation, and said to have cost $28,000
originally, was purchased as the very Bpot
desired. Its seating capacity is given at
3000. The building is surrounded by five
acres of land, covered with lawns and
dotted with beautiful shade trees. All tbe
camps will be set up in this park, and the
meetings will be held in the structure of
artificial stone.
As a place for a camp-meeting it bids
fair to be classified as ideal. In conse
quence the association is elated over its
excellent luck in making the purchase.
They could have done no better, the man
agers say, if they had spent six months in
searching for a suitable location.
Stepben D. Dye, president of the St ate
Camp-meeting Association and of the
mediums and speakers of San Francisco,
will leave this City for Redondo July 28.
It is expected that at least 500 or 600 mem
bers will be encarcped upon the ground,
not to mention the number that will visit
the grounds from adjacent towns.
The meeting will last throughout the
month of August, and will break up only
in time to permit tbe leaders to return to
this City in time for 'the first annual con
vention of the State Spiritualist Associa
tion. The principal speakers at the camp
meeting will be W. J. Colville of Boston and
J. J. Morse, who has been the leading
apostle of spiritualistic doctrine in the
California Psychical Society for a year and
a half.
Both men are leading exponents of the
cult and are widely known both in Eng
land and America. In their methods of
teaching they differ widely, Colville being
inclined toward the consideration of ab-
Btruse metaphysical propositions, while
Morse is eminently practical. So the
advocates of the "gospel of spiritualism"
feel assured that nothing monotonous will
creep into the dissertations to which they
will give ear.
Besides these two men, eminent in tbe
rank and file of tbe organization, there

ENTHUSIASTIC CYCLERS.
A Mammoth Parade of Wheelmen la
Assured for the Latter Part
of This Month.
The Cycle Board of Trade held a called
meeting last night to confer with the cap
tains of the various bicycle clubs of this
City with a view to getting suggestions
and to perfect arrangements for the grand
parade on tbe 25th inst. J. 8. Coumell
was in the chair.
The question of placing in line the un
attached wheelmen was fully discussed,
and a motion was finally passed that each
club should issue invitations to the unat
tached wheelmen in its particular district.
These will parade with the various clubs,
and a pennant will be given to tne club
turning out the greatest number of wheel
men, attached and unattached.
Invitations will be sent also t*r the j
Cycle Board, and all unattached wheel
men not invited by a club will be given a
place directly behind the Alpha Club in
tbe van of the parade.
The distributing points for lanterns and j
decorations to the unattached wheelmen l
will be at the several clubhouses, the
general distributing point to be at
Twenty-second and Shotwell streets.
Judge Kerriean was elected grand mar
shal of the wheelmen's division of the
parade. He announced that be would
choose for bis chief aid Harlow H. White,
president of the Associated Cycling Cluds.
SUICIDE BY SHOOTING.
Harry Luther Fires a Bullet
Into His Head With
Deadly Effect
Possibility of an Unknown Woman
Haying Been tbe Cause of
tbe Rash Act.
Harry Luther, 32 years of age, who has
been employed driving a sodawater
wagon, committed suicide yesterday even
ing at his room at 34 Golden Gate avenue
by sending a bullet through bis head from
a Smith & Wesson revolver. The bullet
had entered near the right ear and death
must have been instantaneous.
E. Feeney, a friend of the deceased man,
had seen him shortly before the shooting.
Luther had then seemed in a contented
frame of mind and was reading a novel.
When Feeney returned shortly afterward
Luther was lying dead on the bed and near
him lav the pistol, just as be bad dropped
it after firing the fatal shot Feeney
hastened to notify tbe Coroner and the
body was removed to the Morgue.
Upon the dead man's clothing were
found numerjus letters &ua cards. A
number of old letters from friends and
relatives in Indiana were found and also
letters from a woman signed "Flo." A.
gold badge was also found which evidently
belonged to the young man's father and
which bore the inscription, "20th Regi
ment, Indiana Volunteers, War of 1861."
A marriage certificate was also found
among tbe deceased's effects, showing that
in 1893 he had been married by Justice of
the Peace Dunne to Eva Frawley. A re
ceipt for $5 from Attorney Alexander
Cam pbell Jr. f or services in the case of
Luther vs. Luther indicated that a suit for
divorce had been subsequently instituted.
Later it was learned from one of the <ie
ceastd's friends that a divorce had actu
ally been obtained. Whether this was the
result of an attachment for the woman
'â¢Flo" is a matter of conjecture.
Luther's friend, Feeney, when seen last
night, declared that he had been creatly
surprised at Luther's suicide. "Luther
was an uncommunicative, quiet sort of
fellow," he declared, "but appeared to be
quite cheerful. About three weeks ago be
fell off his own wagon and was run over,
and had to go to the Receiving Hospital,
but yesterday he was discharged as en
tirely cured. Before leaving the hospital
he was visited by C. E. Triplett,. by whom
he was employed for a long time Â«s bar
keeper. Whether the suicide was com
mitted in a fit of insanity, produced by his
previous.accident, I do not know."
Luther is supposed to have wealthy rela
tives in the East and in Germany, but
their addresses could not be learned from
the letters found upon bis person. The
last letters from the father were dated
from Crown Point, Indiana, but he is
known since then to have been in Los An
geles, and bis present residence is un
known. Information may be obtained to
day from the dead man's former em
ployer, Triplett, as to the whereaboutÃ of
his relatives, and if they are found the
body will probably be forwarded for inter
ment.
Off to Santa Cruz.
On Sunday, August 2, an excursion will be
run to Santa Cruz under the personal super
vision of Colonel W. 11. Menton. The fare for
the round trip has been fixed at $W. and pro
visions will be made for the comfort of all who
go. Five hours at the beach and sight-seeing
about Santa Cruz will no doubt attract a large
crowd.

Assays of Average Samples
Range From $40 to

HOW HIS TUNNEL CAVED IN.
Now the Spring Valley Company
Keeps Two Men Watchicg
Their Flume.
Strange things have been taring place
of late on tbe southwestern declivity of
the Twin Peaks range of hills. The busy
world around paid no attention. Even
the crowds that daily went to the Ingle
side races, or on Sundays to the Ingleside
coursing park, passed unheedful of it all.
And yet within a few hundred yards of
the peaks two men nave discovered gold,
what they claim to be rich rotten
quartz assaying as high as $180 a
ton and extending from the sur
face downward a great distance â in
fact, a veritable mountain of singularly
rich, tractable ore that bears promise of a
vast fortune.
This is not all, either. The Spring
Valley Water Company has come
upon the scene, and for months
two of its men have bean on duty
night and day since January last watch
ing 150 to 200 feet of flume and iron pipe
on the biliside. For there has been an
open feud between the water company and
the miners.
As far back as 1881, N. H. Shoot, an old
time miner, prospecting in the San Fran
cisco hills in that vicinity, discovered what
he declares was the outcropping of a rich
quartz ledge. He made satisfactory ar
rangements with the French Savings
Bank on a lease to prospect and work the
quartz, but in time the bank withdrew
and Shoot was thwarted in his purpose to
develop a gold mine. Nothing daunted,
he turned his attention to the black aurif
Croppings of the Rich Gold Ledge on the Hill Above t he Ingleside Racetrack,
erous sand on the beach about two miles
distant, across Lake Merced, and as the
months passed he washed out sold dust in
quantities sufficient to encourage him Ito
remain on the beach. Meanwhile Sutro
bought the land with the gold quartz mine
over near Inglesiae. From him Shoot se
cured a lease of .a ; few ? acres on the hillâ
ground absolutely worthless to all appear
ances, rocky, barren and inaccessible. But
beneath the surface lay the dream .of
Shoot's latter years, and it was to tunnel
and bore : into the hill - that he obtained
legal rights from Sutro. â 
The ground to-day is .; covered , with a
promising % young ;. forest of eucalyptus,
pines and cypress, so that the prospect

the outside world On j closer inspection,
however, may be found : : on ej shaft 75 feet

could the water company, it seems, until
after the damage was done. Then Shoot
sued the company, and last December he
met defeat in the Superior Court. The
old miner, utterly dejected and heartsore
over his loss and subsequent defeat, said
some hard things about the water com
pany, and immediately two watcumen put
in an appearance near his cabin. They
erected a shelter from the fogs and winds
and settled down to a steady watch of the
pipe, and night and day they were on
guard in the Tittle opening in the woods.
Shoot was also at bis post over the peak.
He is a typical miner of the early days â a
roughened and toughened old man, with
strong lines in his face, an apparent disre
gard for conventionalities of dress and full
of an abiding confidence of a fortune in
sight. He claims 71 years, yet he can
handle a pick or shovel, vault a fence and
chew his tobacco plug with the youneest
miner in the mines. He stood near his
mine yesterday, contemplating the piles
of rusty black rock about him.
"Does it pay?" he said, repeating the
question. "Do you think I'd be here if it
didn't? I've been, mining in California
since '50. Every pound of this rock is
good, it averages $40 a ton. I'd be satisfied
with $10. A man in the City â is ready to
put up a plant for crushing and reducing
the ore, but now I want to find out the
width of the ledge before Igo any further,
I have this shaft down 150 feet and it goes
clean through pay quartz from the sod. 1
The ledge runs southwest and ' northeast,
at an angle of 20 degrees. It is.practically
a mountain of rotten quartz full of metal,
I've burned the rock in my stove and got
lots of gold out of it. Rich? "Well, ask
Thomas Price. .He has done all my assay
ing, and he reported the ore from differ
ent places here to assay as high as $180. '
-That old : shaft over there," he con
tinued, pointing toward a hole fenced in
and i halt covered with a: : tangle of ; ferns
and briars. ; "I sank that in '81, and when
the bank wanted it I put in a few sticks of
powder and closed up the > drift. The
other shaft is about seventy feet deep, and
it sa tisfied me about the dip of t the ledge.

men who get $2 each a day to keep their
eyes on it.
"I made money in mmmg â lots of it;
$6000 down there in that black sand on
the shore, and I've spent $15,000 neht
here in this quartz."
Shoot bas a partner and employs a third
man to help in the mine, which he has
worked assiduously for a long time. He
declared yesterday that in a very short
time the result of his patient toil will
show itself and then fortunes will be
taken from the rusty mountain of quartz.
WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD.
Peter Gordon Found Seriously
Wounded on Second
Street
He Stated That He Was Waylaid by
a Tall Fcotpadâ May Have
Attempted Suiciae.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 15. j
The residents around the corner of Sec- |
ond and Jefferson streets were startled â 
about 9:30 to-nigbt by four shots ringing '
out on the air. People on the street '
rushed in the direction of the sonnd sand ;
found a man lyinp in a pool of blood. He
tv conscious when taken to the Re- |
ceiving Hospital and gave the name of j
Peter Gordon. He claims to be a Russian j
from Wilna. He has been stopping at i
Reudys Hotel on Seventh and Franklin j
streets for the past four days. He has a
brother in Guerneville.
Dra. Dunn, Hamlin, Sill and Kuchein
called, and an examination being made,
only a superficial wound was found in the
forehead over the right eye. He claimed
that a tall man with a heavy mustache
stopped him with a command to throw up
bis hands, and, without waiting to have
the command obeyed, commenced firing
at him. This much was gained, little at a
time, from the injured man, who was very
unwilling to talk upon the subject.
Chief of Police Lloyd at once sent men
to examine the locality.
The first discovery was a revolver of a
cheap pattern among the bushps, which
had either been hid or thrown .there. The
officers did not give much credence to the
story of a tall man doing the shooting, but
I claim it is an attempt at suicide. Gor
don's fingers and forehead are powder
burned somewhat. Steward Victory of
the Receiving Hospital says it is a case of
attempted suicide without a doubt.
Gordon was a traveling salesman for a
dry-goods firm. He was recently from
Healdsburg. ....
ANOTHER M'KINLEY CLUB.
A New Organization Known as the
Golden West Launched.
A new Republican club was organized at
Irish- American Hail last night. The
greater number present were young men
whose homes are on the south bounds of
Market street.
The following officers were elected:
William B. Crane, president; William B.
Canty, first vice-president; James Craw
ley, second vice-president; Jamos Carroll,
secretary; Frank Wall, corresponding sec
retary; Edward Birmingham, sereeant-at
arms; executive committee â John J.
Daughney, William P. Connors, Thomas
McDermott.
The roll showed over 150 names, princi
pally of young men who are about to cast
their first vote. All of them have shown
their preference for the party of progress
and protection.
