VOLUME LXXX.â NO. 56.
SAN FRANCISCO BICYCLE RIDERS AS DISCIPLES OF PROGRESS.
Enthusiastic Outpouring of Devotees of tfye Wheel Who Jlre Determined on Improving the
City's Thoroughfaresâ Fully One .Hundred Thousand Spectators Viewed the Parade.
BICYCLISTS of every age, race,
sex and colorâ bicyclists from
every stratum of cycledom, from
the scorcher with hia interroga
tion-point hump to the hoary
â¢eaded patriarch biker, pitting in military
trectness on antique 60-ponnder wheelsâ
n short, everyoody who could claim any
legree of proficiency in managing a wheel,
urned out last nigbt to take part in the
;reat demonstration in favor of pood
treets.
Such a parade as last night's has never
Â»efore greeted the eyes of San Franciscans
.nd it was estimated that at least 100,000
pectators lined the streets. The number
if wheelmen who started with the proces
ion is estimated to have been at least 5000.
They came from every direction on wheels
n every stage of decoration and thronged
fie streets in the vicinity of Twenty-sec
nd and Folsom until even the pedestrians
ould scarcely move.
Long beiore the order to fall in was
dven thousands had assembled. Posi
iona of vantage from which to view the
iarade had been pre-empted all along Fol
om street. The sidewalks were thronged
or blocks and the windows of every
.ouse were crowded with spectators. It
ras the same all along the hue of march,
Â«ut the contrast between the u>ual quiet
ess that prevails along the Mission streets
cade the activity and bustle last night
specially prominent.
While the procession moved down Fol
om street all went well. The street has
teen recently paved and the smooth sur
Â»ce of the pavement is a perpetual delight
o wheelmen. When, however, the line of
laroh turned onto the rough and uneven
owntown cobblestones the trouble be
;an. Falls apd collisions somewhat shat
ered the serried ranks of wheelmen and
Â»r the rest of the distance to the speak
rs' stand on Van Ness avenue the march
ras a race of individuals rather than of
odies.
The scene on Van Ness avenue after the
tragglers had reunited was a wonderfully
â moated one. As in the Mission
rhen the procession started, so on the
.venue at the finish the sidewalks and
ouch of the street were black with people,
ted fires blazed on every corner, and at
be corner of Fell and Van Ness a huge
onfire threw its glare upon the motley
aultitu.de. Emblazoned in vari-col
a-ed Chinese lanterns upon a wail op
osite the speakers' stand, the inscription
'Finish Folsom Street" admonished the
ssembled cyclers that Market street was
ot the only street that needed improve

"Repave Market street," however, was
be warcry last night. Placards of every
ize and color and glaring transparencies
eiterated the laconic demand for street ini
rovement. And few of the thousands of
pectators who witnessed the great e'emon
-1 ration last night failed to realize that
bis warcry is coing to be one of the great
logans of the coming municipal cam
aign. It was easily apparent that a new

tent factor in determining future munici
pal administration.
The turnout last night was, as it were,
a test of the political strength of the
wheelmen, and it showed how great that
strength really is. It is said that the
wheelman vote will amount to something
like 30,000, and with such a balance of
power they are quite likely to effect a
change in the policy that has long pre
vailed in street improvement, of putting
down smooth pavements among the sand
dunes and on the rocky hillsides of the
remote suburbs and leaving the principal
thoroughfares of the City in a condition of
comparative impassibility that would
shame all but Silurians.
The demand â with which last night's
great demonstration will do much to secure
compliance â will probably be but the
initial one of a series for street improve
ment reform.
The wisdom shown by the wheelmen in
co-operating thus to secure the one de
sired improvement seems very likely to be
' rewarded with success. The very fact that
they stand together as a body instead of
being divided by each one working for
some local improvement affecting his own
neighborhood proves that their promi
nence as a public factor will be consider
able.
Mission residents are particularly inter
ested in securing the repaying of Market
street and obtaining a means of commu
nication with the City, such as Golden
Gate avenue furnishes to Western Addi
tion residents. Nevertheless, proposed im
provements will affect nearly every wheel
man in this City and out of tlie City as
well. Many of the cyclers who now ride
to San Jose by way of Oakland and San
Leandro do so because they dread the ride
over the rough cobblestones and along the
slippery cable-slots of this City. If a
smooth street gave them an opportunity
of getting out into the country and down
toward San Mateo County without risk
ing tiieir necks and shaking themselves
and their wheels to pieces on the cobbles
a ereat many wheelmen would take the
San Mateo route to San Jose, instead of
crossing the bay to Oakland.
Never in the history of the southeast
| end of Folsom street was there anything
to compare with the scene that was wit
nessed there at 8 o'clock last evening.
Old and young, fat and lean turned out as
if by magic upon the adjoining streets
leading into this newly bituminized thor
oughfare. Houses that heretofore were
content with an ordinary hall light be
came illuminated from basement to gar
ret. Not content with turning on a full
stream of gas lights in every room com
manding a view an abundance of Chinese
lanterns were strung from roof to stakes
in the ground about the gardens.
Noticeable among the residences which
made more than an ordinnay display were
that of Captain W. A. Philips, 2832 Fol
som street, whose three-story building
was a transparency worthy of comment.
Captain A. F. Spear, 2908 Folsom,
had "old glory" out at fall length, with a
i string of Chinese lanterns on other side.
H. C. Somers, 2906 Folsom, tried to
surpass his neighbor in his line of deco
rating. George Flack's residence, 2900
Folsom, shone forth in splendor with a
variety of lights. Mrs. F. Nelion did her
share to give eclat to the occasion. George
Bueker and F. S. Nieson added much in
their line. But the handsomest decorated
place on this section, so far as its unique
ness was concerned, was the residence of
William McMurray, 2926 Folsom, where
each rose bush and vine bore its burden
of lanterns.
The front of Cosgrove Bros.' store on
Folsom and Twenty-sixth streets was
handsomely set out with an abundant dis

play of lanterns and American small flags.
Henry Mohr, 2934 Folsom, was as good as
his neighbors in the illuminating line.
Captain George A. Raabe, with his fifty
aids, took up their stations on Twenty
sixth street, west of Folsom, and there
patiently awaited the formation of the
procession on Shotwell street. In the
meantime every man, woman and child
in charge of a wheel were busy trimming
their lamps and attaching their Chinese
lanterns to every conceivable limb of the
silent modern horse.
Some bad huge umbrellas, some had
small ones, while others had noneâ but all
had their wheels decorated with red and
white bands bound round the rims, on the
sriokes, and, in fact, all over the entire
bike. Each bicycle had its ever-present
bell, ranging in tone from the husky rat
tle of the cowbell to the sharp tinkle of
the silver-tongued alarm.
At last a squad of mounted police hove
in sight on the corner of Folsom and
Twenty-sixth streets and gave the order to
form on Shotwell street and wheel round
Twenty-sixth in rear of the grand marshal
and bis aids.
As this order was heard and understood
there was a movement such as never be
fore was witnessed in San Francisco.
Chinese lanterns commenced to move as
if by magic.
As soon as the bead of the procession
swung into Folsom that boulevard was
lighted up by a sudden flare of calcium
lights from doorsteps and balconies until
that portion of the street was illuminated
with lurid rays which, when thrown on '
the passing decorated bicycles, produced a
most pleasin? effect.
This exhibition was kept up and down
the street as far as the eye could reach,
while the procession went on and on.
The following divisions and organiza
tions of wheelmen were in the line:
Advance platoon mounted police. '

As the troop of horsemen in the ran of
the procession made their way at a clip
ping gait along Folsom street the crowd,
which bad assumed large proportions even
as far as Fourth street, gave away easily.
But when Tenth street was reached the
street was a mass of people clean to the
center.
The squad of police in front of the
grand marshal were scarcely able to make
a pass ace way through.
On Market street the horsemen made a
slow determined charge from Eighth
down to Kearny. The cable-cars were so
burdened on their sides, roof and platform
that they sagge d perceptibly.
It would have required a hundred police
men to hold in check the enormous crowd
on the downtown streets; it surged in on
the procession like the ocean and looking;
back on Market street the horsemen saw
nothing of the wheel cavalcade they were
leading but an occasional lamp boDbing
above a black stream of people.,
The bursting of a rocket in the air fol
lowed by a glare of red fire was the sig
nal for the wheelmen to move, and then
the band near the head of the column
struck up a popular air. Divisions and
clubs wheeled into line and began the trip
down Folsom street. The residents along
that thoroughfare were all alive to the oc
casion, and on nearly every house front
were displayed Japanese lanterns and
bunting.
. In many of the windows were illumina
tions in the old-fashioned style â rows of
candles placed one above another.
One of the most unique in the line ofjil
luminating was at a house near Twentieth
street, where the front steps, bay-wiu*

AT JHE QRA^D ST/\ND ON VAN NESS AVENUE.

ride." â Samuel M. Shortridge.
dows, porch and lawn were failed with
streetcar and locomotive headlights, so
arranged as to shed their light into the
street.
As the wheelmen moved down the street
they were greeted with cheer after cheer
by those in the windows of every house
and by those who lined the street.
From the starting point to the turn at
Eighth street the streets were thronged,
even to the inconvenience of the cyclers,
for the people crowded out to the car
tracks, leaving but a narrow passage-way.
In addition to this was tbe inconvenience
of the Folsom-street electric cars, which
ran both ways and caused break after
break in the line of march.
In several instances the cars were obliged
to join in the procession, so to speak, be
cause the floats on trucks could not be re
moved from tbe tracks.
By the time the head of the line reached
Ninth street the end was not in sight, and
from all accounts it was located back on
Eighteenth or Nineteenth street. From
Ninth to Eighth street the crowd began to
manifest itself in earnest. Eighth street
from Folsom to Market was simply im
passable, except to the cyclers, who were
given a smail strip in the middle of tbe
street. As each float and gayly decorated
wheel came into view it was greeted with
enthusiasm, and in not a few instances the
cyclers were good naturedly bombarded
with Roman candles.
It was not until the cyclers reached
Market street that they realized what
wheeling thiough th-s masses really is.
They bad met with large and enthusias
tic gatherings on Folsom street, big crowds
on Ninth aud Eighth streets, but on Mar
ket street it was literally a surging mass
of humanity.
After leaving Eighth and Market streets,
on its way downtown, tbe parade cot into
difficulties that eventually resulted in its
going to pieces before Kearny street was
reached.
As soon as the platoon of police had
passed, the densely packed masses of
humanity that lined both sides of the
street closed in on tbe cyclists, and be
fore Fourth street was reached only a nar
row lane not over three feet wide was left
to allow the wheelmen to pass. Riding in
this narrow space, particularly over the
cobbles, was out of the question, and the
majority dismounted and led their wheels.
Tbe parade was noticeably weaker after
leaving Van Ness avenue, for many clubs
became weary of the continual effort of
pushing through tbe throngs and gave up
the struggle. Some cut off into side streets
and deserted the parade completely, while
others, seeing no prospect of getting
through to Kearny street with whole
wheels or decorations, cut out of the line
and joined the countermarch as soon as an
opportunity presented itself.
Those who came late down Market street
seemed to be completely at sea and many
clubs were swallowed up in the crowds.
A few that escaped in any kind of forma
tion wandered or crowded their way down
Kearny street without knowing where they
were going. Some rode as far as Califor
nia street, while others turned back at
Post, and after trying vainly to re-enter
Market street went their various ways
without even a semblance of order.
The greatest crowd of all was at Kearny
and Market streets and it may safely be
said that the very enthusiasm of the peo
ple prevented the parade from being a
grand spectacle at that point.
Tbe streetcars that bad been blocked for
some time added to the general confusion
about the time the last of the wheelmen
reached Kearny street, their dozens of
Jangling gongs turning the night into pan
demonium. Before the tail end of the
parade reached Kearny street it had ceased
to be a parade and became a rout wbere
every man or woman looked out for him
self or herself.
Where small bands of wheelmen were
trying to escape a few extinguished lan
terns on poles or wires showed nbove the
heads of the crowding, perspiring i jam of
humanity, while here and there a wheel
woman stood in the doorway with her
wheel, having giving np the struggle
against the - crowds and v retired to a
place of safety to await a chance to get
home. . . ; ;....,. :j : â ââ â ;.". ,; ;^
; Toward the latter end of the parade the
rowdies â â¢ that ; were largely '; in â  evidence
along the line of march began to make it
very ' uncomfortable for Â- the paraders.
One man with a- beautiful superstructure
of lanterns and flags tried to cross Market
to get down Third street when 1 some one
made a grab at a lantern dangling from a
* wlrt and the wheelman turned to ex
postulate, but in an instant his float was
seized on all sides and torn to pieces be
fore he could make the slightest effort to
get away.
A Japanese who rode, or rather led, a
gayly decorated wheel was in trouble be
fore he had gone a hundred yards beyond
Kearny street. He foolishly attempted to
fight his assailants, and was knocked
down and trampled on until a squad of
police chartred the mob and rescued him.
His face was cut, his clothing torn and his
wheel wrecked. Two young girls were
in the midst of the surging crowd as it
struggled about the policemen, and one
nearly bad her clothing torn from her
body before she could escape to the out
skirts. Many of the wheelmen and their
lady friends did not venture to leave the
vicinity of Kearny and Market streets un
til the crowds had dispersed, which was
an hour after the parade had melted
away.
Car 21 of the Valencia-street line fol
lowed the rear of the procession too closely
down Market street and had a rather tur
bulent time of it. Near the corner of Sev
,enth street the car encroached rather
close upon the heels of the last of the
wheelmen. This enraged the crowd and
they commenced snouting at the motor
man.
Some one suggested overturning ths car,
and the mob took kindly to the sugges
tion. Grasping the car by the upright
bars at the Bide they commenced rocking
it until it threatened to go over. The pas
sengers screamed and things were looking
very critical, when an opening occurred
and the car was able to escape. The same
car had a similar experience at Fifth and
Market streets.
The floats, properly speaking, were not a
prominent feature of the bicyie parade.
They were few and far between, yet they
were attractive and popular.
A pirate-ship, or a freebooter, beaded
the procession. It was a tandem, deco
rated with flags and ablaze with Japanese
Jan terns.
The miniature ship displayed a skull
and crossbones at its masthead and scores
of Japanese lanterns at its yards. It was
carried by Club 13, of which R. C. Lennie
is president. The colors of the miniature
ship were of a flaming red, and, taken all
in all, it presented a very striking appear
ance. At the bow was seen the frowning
mouth of a cannon, proclaiming the war
like character of the ship.
The float entitled "The New Charter,"
was drawn by a spanking span of bay
horses.
It was illustrated with a picture of work
ingmen and workingwomen in search of
employment, and bore the following in
scription: "A vote for the new charter
means steady wages for the workingmen."
Upon the reverse side of the transpar
ency were the interrogatories: "Do you
want good streets?" "Do you want im
provements?" "If so, vote for the new
charter."
The Bay City Wheelmen bad a big float
in line bearing about a dozen men in regu
lation street-laborers' garb. A large ban
ner suspended above the float bore the
legend, "The Bay Citys Are Willing to
Work to Have Market Street Improved."
A transparency also bore the inscription,
"Hunting for Good Roads."
One of the most striking floats was that

The Awful FatÂ» of the Obdurata Silurian of thÂ© Future.
of tbe Union Iron Works. It was drawn
by four beautiful dark bays, and consisted
of a model of the battle-ship Oregon, sur
mounted by a canopy of Japanese lanterns.
At the rear of tbe float an aged employe of
the iron works bore aloft a large Amer
ican flae. At the sides of tbe wagon were
bung banners bearing the motto, "What's
the Matter With the Oregon?" About
thirty employes of the works escorted on
bicycles this miniature of their master
piece.
A significant showing was that of tbe
South Bide Improvement clubs. Their
sentiments were typified by two pinto
mules drawing a waeon upon whose
sides werÂ« emblazoned the words, 'We
won't stop kicking until Folsom street is
finished." The float of the San Francisco
Road Club was appropriate and emphatic.
It consisted of a miniature gallows, from
which an effigy was suspended. Above
tbe crosspiece was a grewsome warning,
embellished by a frightful skull and cross
bones, stating that sucb was the "Fate of
the first politician who opposed good
roads."
A yacht manned by four men on con
cealed bicycles was a feature contributed
by the employes of the Rambler Cyclorama.
The effect was produced by coupling two
tandems, which were entirely hidden by
tbe canvas hull of the craft.
The moat artistic float in line was that
of the Imperial Cycling Club. It repre
sented a large white crown resting on a
white cushion. The crown was begemmed
with numerous little incandescent lights
which flashed alternately, giving the im
pression of sparkling stones. A banner
suspended from the rear of tbe vehicle
bore tbe club yell: "Holy smoke! Who
are we? You know, we are I. C. 0."
The California Social Club Cyclers bad a
beautiful float in line. It was mounted
upon two bicycles and consisted of a deli
cate little chariot apparently formed of
blue and gold ribbon, the club colors, from
wbich little Hazel McGinn drove through
the air two beautifully decorated little
bicycles.
G. Hale and A. Lewis of the Golden
Gate Cycling Club made a striking appear
ance, with an elaborately decorated out
fit. They had two bicycles coupled to
gether, to which was attached an intricate
framework strung with Japanese lanterns,
thirty- seven in all.
An attractive feature was the beautiful
canopy supported by a tand6m and borne
at the head of the Yerein Eintracht
cyclers. The decoration was the work of
E. Peterson, and was one of the most
beautifully decorated wheels in line.
H. B. Williams and James Gaus of the
California Cycling Club rode a tandem
bearing a boat-shaped frame covered with
fringe tissue paper.
Cass Mershon of the Golden Gate Cycling
Club had his wheel entwined with straw,
and he was made up as the "far down"
hayseed is supposed to disport himself.
He bore aloft the motto, "I B'long to the
Golden Gates."
On the west side of Van Ness avenue, a
few hundred feet north of where that
thoroughfare debouches into Market
street, was the stand erected fortbe speak
ers of the evening, and before whom the
parade passed in review just previous to
dispersing. It was gayly decorated with
red, white and blue bunting and made
brilliant by an arc electric light and
strings of Japanese lanterns.
Directly opposite tbe side of a dwelling
the Boutbside Improvement clubs bad
provided for having blazoned forth to the
thousands about in letters of fiery hue six
feet high, produced by vari-colored Japan
ese lanterns, the demand to ''Finish Fol
som street."
People began to line the curbs before 8
o'clock, though the head oi tbe procession
of wheelftrs did not turn into Van Ness
avenue from Golden Gate until 9:35
o'clock.
As the procession passed the stand in
review bombs, roman candles and rockets
were discharged, bonfires were ablaze on
tbe corners and red tire and colored lights
made a brilliant glare.
Dr. T. A. Rottanzi ncted as master of
ceremonies and J. S. Conwell as president
of the evening. Among those on tbe
platform in addition to the speakers were:
Dr. C. D. Salfield. president of the Pan
handle Improvement Club; G.W.Owen;
F. W. Dohrman, president of the Mer
chants' Association; Judge F. W. Van
Reynegom, Colonel Chadbourne and quite
a number of ladies.
While the paraders were still marching
past tbe tribune Pr. Rottsnzl introduced
President Conwell in a few brief sentences.
He said:
Ladies and gentlemen and cyclists : We have
assembled here alter one of the most remark
able demonstrations ever seen in the interest
ot good streets. I now take pleasure in intro
ducing to you President Conwell.
The latter's remarks follow:
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the
HOW MR. HAIGHCEDE LOOKED ON HIS WHEEL.
' Southslde improvement clubs and on behalf of
the San Francisco Cycle Board of Trade, I con
gratulate you upon the magnificent parade
which you have bo successfully accomplished:
The objects of our demonstration as wheel
men are threefold. Primarily, to educate us
all in a realizing sense of our own strength
and possible influence. Secondly, to rejoice
with our Southslde friends over the improve
ment of Folsom street; and lastly, to protest
most vigorously against the condition of San
Francisco pavements in general and Market
street in particular.
Similar demonstrations In sister cities have
resulted in such an awakening of the public
mind to public action that to-day the Dicyole
is considered to be the greatest boon of mod
ern invention, if for nothing more than for its
accomplishments in the betterment of city
streets and country roads.
I trust that the objects of this demonstration
are accomplished and from to-night we may
date a new era lor Sas Francisco and her pave
ments.
The concerted action of wheelmen and
wheelwomen will accomplish not only the re
paying of Market street and the completion of
Folsom street, but the lighting of tbe park and
many other improvements that will add ma
terially to tho wealth, health and comfort of
our city.
But, in order to be effective, our efforts must
be harmoniously directed along the line of
reasonable demands. Grant this and we may
count upon the hearty sympathy and support
of the two irresistible forcesâ the people and
the press.
Hearty co-operation will secure tho enforce
ment of our demands and will demonstrate to
every well-wisher of our City that "where
there is a wheel, there is a way."
Mayor Sutro, one of the invited speakers,
sent the following note in explanation of
his absence, through his secretary, which
was read by President Conwell:
Gentlemenâ Your Invitation to participate
In the monster good roads demonstration was
received by Mr. Sutro. His best wishes go with
ths demonstration and the organizers. He
rarely, however, leaves his home at the Heights
in the eveniu* and for that reason he begs you
will excuse his inability to be present.
Wishing you all good in your work, very
truly yours, A. C. Unswobth, Secre tary.
The next speaker was Samuel M. Short
ridge, who spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman, young ladies and gentle
men: Whether you be riders of the wheel or
not I wish to be by my words understood to
say that I am in favor of good government, of
good Supervisors and of good streeta.
To those young ladies and gentlemen who
ride the wheel â whose wheels do not go round
up here (pointing to his bead)â l wish to say
that the great problem of the agesâ the great
problem that has engaged the attention of the
philosophers from tbe days of Socrates to
Mayor Sutroâ [laughter]â thÂ« great problem of
the ages you have solvedâ and that problem is
how to get on iv the world.
I understand that this meeting to-night is
to give our voices and our approval to every
thing that goes in the government toward the
improvement of the streets of San Francisco
and the roads of California. It is not neces
sary for me to impress upen you the necessity
of having good streets in order to make a
great record. But I think that we, as citizens
of San Francisco, have cause to be proud of
the fact that we have improved our street*
during the last two or three years and that
the improvement on Folsom street is but what
will be done on this great and beautiful
avenue and other streets throughout San
Francisco.
We have a beautiful City; we hare a grand
and magnificent City; we have fine streets and
we have great avenues; we have everything
that is essential to a great city. But it requires
money to improve the roadways. I wish,
therefore, merely to say that so far as I am con
cerned, I think I express the sentiments of the
citizens of this City when I say I am in favor
of generous appropriations to pay for tne im
provement of the streets and highways, not for
the bicyclist! alone, but for the horse.
You will pardon me if I pay a silent tribute
to that noble and patient animal, for he is still
with us. I will, so far as I can, assist in any
local legislation that will result in the im
provement of our streets and our roads
throughout the State.
The greatness ot the City depends upon the
character of Its transpo nation facilities, and
we will seek to improve the highways of our
City, that there may be rapid transit on the
streets along which we ride.
Congressman Maguire was loudly
cheered as he came to the front of the
platform. His remarks follow:
Ladies and gentlemen : I am pleased to be
with you iv this hour of comparative victory,
and will be pleased, indeed, to further not
only the finishing of Folsom street from
Twenty-sixth to Third, but the paving of the
streets and avenues everywhere which lead to
Golden Gate Park. The demands of the people
for public improvements should be complied
with.
The people who use the bicycle in their daily
travels about the City demand that the City
officials shall appropriate enough lunds to
make their progress about the City comforta
ble and safe.
I have had the pleasure of being one of them
for the past five years, and Join most cordially
ln this demand.
I notice that the enterprising citizens have
made their demand in letters of fire on the
building opposite. "Finish Folsom street,"
they say, and I second their demand.
I want to see another thing done here. We
have one of the grandest driving parks in the
world. Our cyclists are using it by night by
the thousands. It is entirely uniliumiuated.
Eastern cities have similar parks and all of
them are illuminated. San Francisco should
not be behind any of her Eastern rivals. Golden
Gate Park must be lighted at night.
San Francisco should be placed in the front
rank with other cities, and her streets and
roads should be so improved that good high
ways will lead from everywhere to Golden Gate
Park.
Your demands, made manifest to-night, are
sure to meet with consideration at the hands
of these elected to office if you but see that
your votes -and influence are properly directed.
Jaliua Kahn was introduced as an oid
time and enthusiastic wheelman. He
heartily indorsed the objects of the dem
onstration and was followed by J. Richard
Freud. Tbe latter's address follows :
Let us see what our streets costâ s2oo,ooo ex
pended during the past fiscal year la repair
ing the accepted streets of San Francisco;
$34,000,000 spent upon the streets and sew
ers of San Francirco during the past iorty
years! What have we to show for this vast
expenditure? Rotten sewers, patched pave
ments and broken roads. Sewers, 'justly con
demned as tbe worst of any civilized commun
ity on earth, except the City of Mexico. Pave
ments, the most defective of any progressive
city in the United States. Roads, thai are the
laughing stock of the villages of the country.
Such is the street picture of the third rich
est city In Americaâ a metropolis with an as
sessable wealth of $360,000,000. A city,
whose marvelous natural resou-cea should
make it the most beautiful and attractive cen
ter on the face of the globe. What is the
cause of this anomalous condition? It is
clearly owing to the obsolete and defective
system of municipal government, known as
the consolidation act. A code of laws forty
years out of date, amended and supplemented
by successive Legislatures over 400 times. It
was made for a village of 40,000 inhabitants,
and no more tills the wants of this metropolis
of 350,000 people than the clothes of a child
will fit a man.
Under the consolidation act all the streets,
sewers and roads are in charge of the Supervis
ors and the Superintendent of Streets. This
ancient plan has proven a downright failure.
It results in extravagance, ineompetency an<i
eorrupt'on, and has resulted in the pre-ent
disgraceful and dangerous., condition "of our
highways.
There is but one sure remedy for this munici
pal malady. Change the system. Wipe out
the old consolidation act and bring in tne new
charter. When anything gats beyond redemp
tion, patchwork is idle. A mere chauge of offi
cials will never answer. We must root out the
entire system. How will the charter prove
the remedy? It provide a competent Board of
Public Works, with a City Engineer who must
be ten years a practical engineer, and a Super
intendent of Public Works who must be a mas
ter builder. Such a Board of Public Works
will have full charge of all the streets, sewers,
pavements and roads of the City.
The time for tinkering with the streets has
passed. We will never have good streets until
we get good sewers. An improved system of
sewers, with conduits for till tbe wires that
now disfigure our thoroughfares, must go hand
in hand with smooth, sanitary pavements.
Thpse valuable improvements will cost $5,
--000,000 and can only be had by bonding the
City. Future generations will eujoy these
blessings, as well as the taxpayer ol to-day,
and, therefore, posterity should also bear its
fair share of the burdeu.
San Francisco is the only City in the United
States of over 100,000 population that has no
bonded indebtedness. Under our present de
fective system of municipal government the
taxpayers never have and never will lavor
bonding this City. The constitution of Cali
fornia requires a two-thirds vote of the people
to issue bonds. The present stupidity, was: e
ana corruption in handling the public lands
will never warrant the taxpayers to add more
fuel to the fliirnes. Tne charter, however, will
make the bonding oi the City for permanent
public improvements safe, certain and valid.
Under such a modern and approved system of
municipal government, every public-spirited
citizens favor bonding the City.
Adopt the charter and let the City issue
$6,000,000 bonds for fo-ty years. What would
it cost? Our own City banks would be glad
to get the bonds at 4 per cent a yearâ,f2oo,
--000 for interest and $125,000 for a sinking
fund, making $325, 000 a year, less than one
tenth of 1 per cent on the assessed valuation
of property in San Francisco; not even that
much, because a large saving would result by
reducing the tax levy for many repairs and
renewals. Again, every dollar expended by a
city in improvements is matched lay an equal
expenditure by private parties, thus large. y
increasing the revenue of the city.
This, then, is the only safe course open to
the citizens of San Francisco. Adopt the
charter, issue the bonds, improve tne City.
Progress and prosperity will thus be assured.
From now until November 3 let the motto of
every cyclist De, "Curry the charter and win a
victory."
James F. Barry, Colonel Eddy, H. F.
Wynne and several others followed, and
just before tbe close of tne meeting the
following resolutions were read :
Whereas, Street improvement is one of the
first evidences of progress in a great city.
Good streets are as necessary to the welfare of
tbe citizens as good food and good clothes.
The good-streets demonstration of to-night
shows the efforts of the people to better their
condition by improving the streets. This agi
tation during the past year has secured to San
Francisco great benefits in modern street im
provements upon Vun Ness avenue, Folsom
and other streets; and whereas, the gen
eral condition of the business streets
of San Francisco demands continued effort for
their improvement, to place them in condition
for even favorable comparison with the streets
of otner cities of the Unjon. So deplorable is
tne condition of Market street, the main busi
ness artery, with a pavement which, although
it may have been adequate to the demands of
travel upon it many years ago, is now so far
behind the examples of progress set by most of
the cities of this country, that it has become a
daily reproach to the intelligence and the en
ergy of our people; therefore be it
Resolved, That this agitation so successfully
begun be continued until the unsightly
blemish upon the fair face of our City, the
present antiquated pavement of Market street,
has been removed and this street re paved
with a modern roadway suitable to the traffic
of the present times; and also until necessary
improvements of other important streets have
been effected; and further
Resolved, That tbe thanks of this meeting
and ot the citizens of San Francisco are due
and are hereby extended to all those City of
ficials and private citizens, and particularly to
the present Board of Supervisors and the of
ficial expert of the Street Committee, George
W. Elder, who have assisted this movement
by their co-operation, and oy their personal
influence and activity have brought about
much-needed practical results in street im
provements.
They were adopted with a roar and the
vast assemblage dispersed, after having
thus aided to contribute a notable page to
the history of public improvements in the
City and County of San Francisco.

Underhand Work of the Democratic
Tricksters to Be Rebuked by a
Straight Ticket
ST. I.OUIS, Mo.. July 35.â The Demo
rrats suoeÂ«eded in forcing Bryan upon
the Populist convention with the aid of
traitorous leader*, but there will be a
straight ticket in the field.
Half an hour before the result of the
Tote was announced Bryan wired to
Jones of Arkansas that he would de
cline the nomination, because he wonld
not consent to run on a ticket that repu
diated his colleague, National Banker
Sewall. This dispatch was kept a secret
from the convention.
Middle-of-the-road men held a caucus
last night aud learned of the treachery
and the fraud that had been practiced
upon them. They were indignant and
will repudiate the ticket.
JOHX" PAIL COSGBATE.
If the recently deceased Populist Na
tional Convention was a fair type of its
race lam led to the conclusion that a
Populist National Convention is a kinder
garten for young and old orators. Here
were a whole day and a half wasted in
talk preparatory to tHe nomination of two
men, oae for the Presidency and the other
for the Vice-Presidency of the United
States. Every man, almost, of the 1300
and odd on the floor wanted to talk and
had a speech already committed to
memory.
Oh I the lone evenings and the late
watches spent in the composition of these
speeches destined to thrill a nation's repre
sentatives with loyalty and enthusiasm
and to make him, the rural spouter, a
name which" should ring all over the land,
into every village, nook and corner
thereof. How often has he sat by
the coal-oil lamp in his humble
home at midnight, lulled into reverie
by the soft sighing of baby cyclones
through the silken whiskers of the ripen
ing corn, as he pictured the shorthand
representatives of the United Press and of
the leading dailies from San Francisco to
New York and from Halifax to Key West,
and even to Havana, straining their necks
as though they were of rubber in the ef
fort to hear and take down every golden
word that fell from his lips, to flash them
afterward, in all the rotundity of their
periods, into the homes of people all over
thir broad land. "Sdeath!" Shall he who
has toiled through so many lonely vigils
in sweet communion with the muses be
choked off and gagged as thoueh he were
a common dog in the pound. What?
Gag a PopulistT Apply the cloture to that
silvery stream of eloquence ? Nevah 1 be
heavings! nevah !
The spectator who watched with a
critical eye these Edmund Burkes, Daniel
Websters, Foxes and Piuses and Wendell
Phillipses and Eohert G. Ineeraolls in their
flights of verbosity last night and to-day
could not fail to be filled with a suspicion
that the talkers left the Democratic and
Republican parties because there was no
room in those parties f6r them to air their
eloquence. I myself became of the same
opinion respecting many of them. The
escape of all this latent oratory being
their heart's desire, it may be easily under
stood that the oressure from within must
have been of sufficient intensity. So one
can imagine the feeling of pleasure, nay
the thrill of ecstacy, suffusing the entire
being of the Populist delegate when the
bald head and whiskerless chairman,
metaphorically speaJting, punctures the
gasbag with a blow of the gavel, and the
words, "the gentleman from Kalamazoo"
or "Bitter Creek," aa'tne case may be.
These suggestions will throw some light
on the reasons why the red-whiskered man
from Rhode Island was torn from the plat
form last night by two stalwart St. Louis
policemen when he made an uproar be
cause the chairman would not allow the
secretary to read his silver paraphrase of
the Declaration of Independence to its
concluding period. It will explain why
the Connecticut Yankee, away back in the
mar of the hall, became blood-red in the
face and brandished his fiat murderously
when the chair informed him that the
point of order of the colonel from Georgia
was well taken and that he would have to
shut-up like a mouse-trap, just as he had
finished his prefatory remarks and just
as he was warming up to the 212 th degree
of enthusiasm. It was natural that his
collar should have taken fire when" the 300
representatives in the press seats whooped
at him and cried "time." No wonder that
he resisted the efforts of the three police
men to remove him from his standing
position on the seat of his chair, and that
he desisted only wheu his colleagues ad
vised him that it would not be brave or
safe to trip up and gouge and bite three
policemen at once in the presence of so
many witnesses.
One of the funniest of all the elocution
ists in the convention was the red-headed
alogger from North Carolina, whoukept
the spectators shouting with laughter for
about ten minutes last night. He was a
big six-footer, broad-shouldered and deep
chested, tnd weighed about 225 pounds.
With a neck as bovine as that of Grover
Cleveland and a fist as large as that of
John L. Sullivan, he looked and acted for
all the world like a professional pugilist
who has his enemy in chancery and who
is uppercutting him viciously with the
right. The more the people laughed the
more he smashed the air with upward
baif-arm right-hand drives, the poor fel
low believing that the applause and
laughter were testimonials of approbation,
when, in fact, they were only expressions
of good-humored ridicule.
The women of the People's party comp
are faror&bly with the men in the mat
ter of oratory. Among the best of these
is Mrs. Mary Ellen Lease. In her younger
days she was a pretty woman of a
pretty Irish type, but the enervating
climate of the great West has taken the
color out of her cheeks, and the suns and
snows of many a hard political campaign
have flattened something of their round
ness.
Long practice in speating bai strength
ened and rounded her voice until now she
possesses ttie resonant tenor of a man.
Her voice is much rounder and stronger
than eve*n that of Chairman Allen, and
her articulation, which is the indis
pensable thing in public speaking, is so
clear that she can be heard at the farthest
end of the convention hall. Her
gestures are awkward in the extreme,
most of tnem being made with the left
hand, wnich habit was no doubt learned
from watcning Sullivan and Corbett in
their boxing exhibitions. As she thrusts
forward her left arm she leans backward,
and this attitude gives her a rather un
couth profile. As she stands thus, with
her head tnrown back and ncr long eye
lids half closed, she reminds old theater
goers of fearah Bernhart or Jeffreys Lewis:on
the stage in their cat-like moods, purring
their victims into unconsciousness of
danger. She is a Democrat now, and
made a rattling speech for Bryan in which
she claimed him as a Populist, but she
did not mention that a week or ten days
ago Mr. Bryan in public declared that he
was a Democrat, and that the Democratic
party was the only one which could get
the people any relief.
The Texans. the truest of the true blue,
have not so many orators, and these few
are not of tne kindergarten kind. "Stump"
Asnby is a clear speaker, straightforward,
of the Texan quality and with not many
frames of flowers around his sentences.
Milton Parks, the stalwart editor of the
Southern Mercury, robust and manly,
with tnat breezy manliness of the South,
is a man of few words, but each of them
can strike a dlow or wia a friend to the
cau^e he advocates.
Barnett Gibbs is another representative
of the fervid school of oratory, and the
Texans are proud of him. As for "Cy
cloae" Davis, whose political star set
below the horizon of his speech for Bryan
to-day, be is a roughly chiseled orator of
the Methodist exhorter school, the
cadences of his voice alternating between
a sob and shout with a copious rainfall of
tears between. He is quick at repartee,
but not of an original style and does not
wear well. It should be explained here
that the "Cyclone" is not a member of the
Texas delegation, but a member of the
National Committee, so that Texas Pop
ulism is unsullied with the taint of De
mocracy.
Referring to the shameful selling out
to-day of the People's Darty to the Democ
racy by the majority of the Populist lead
ers, I wish 10 call attention to the mamy
and consistent stand of those noble Texans
to-day. When the convention went wild
over the nomination of Bryan, the men from
the Lone Star State raiseu their middle-of
the-road banner as high as they could get
it, and gathered around it as the old guard
used to gather about the regimental colors
when the fight was the thickest and the
enemy at his best. They stood unmoved,
some stern and others with a smile on
their lips, as the shouting hosts filed passed
them with the standards of the Bryan
States. Nor did they flinch even for an
instant when friendly voices and admirers
called upon them pleadingly to join in the
victorious march and wheel their State
into the Bryan column. "Texas,"
"Texas," they cried, "Come along. Fall
into line."
But enthusiasm and cheers and coaxing
could not turn t .em aside from principle,
and when some of the Bryan Democratic
delegates crowded too closely upon them
some of the more excitable Southerners
seized the shouters by the waists and
threw them over the railing. They were
not to be jostled away from the middle-of
the-road standard and they wonld not suf
fer the standards of the few faithful States
that bad rallied around them to be lost in
the crowd.
Three men bolder and more rash than
the rest were knocked down by the indig
nant Texans, and others were saved from
similar hard usage by the interference of
a squad of police. After the tool of the
Democratic tricksters had rapped with his
gavel and announced that the convention
was adjourned for good and all, and when
friends grasped the hands of those gallant
Southerners the tears rolled down their
sunburned ciieeks as they thought of the
shame of the day, of the bitter humiliation
of the morrow. Who would not rather have
one of these outspoken, loyal hard-fisted
men to be his friend than a dozen, nay a
thousand Aliens or Weavers, or McDow
ells, or sockless and conscienceless Simp
sons wuo betrayed to the rotten and cor
rupt Democracy a party which had a prin
ciple, and a constituency representative of
pure-minded American men and women
tillers of the soii?
Shame unon the treachery, and may
oblivion be the fate of the cheaply bought
traitors ! It is fortunate that the people
do not always vole or think with the dele
gates whom they send to a political con
vention, fortunate for the people and un
fortunate for those who betray the trust
confided in them. It is fortunate that the
action of the majority of the convention
w'U not be indorsed by the honest Popu
lists who in their homes to-day were
stabbed to the heart by their betrayal.
The object of the conspirators was to
knife the People's party to the death, but
ttiey failed of their purpose. The party is
too strong; it has too much vitality to
languish and die because of a little blood
letting, and in a lew days when the Bryan
managers are forced to tell the voters of
the United States that hie nomination by
the People's party convention was affected
under the false pretense that he was a
Populist and would indorse the platform
and betray bis colleagues the People's
party will place a ticket in the field headed
with the name of an honest Populist and
with Thomas Â£. Watson of Georgia to
help him in the fight, if not for victory,
for that which is better than mere victory,
for principle.
The blood of the straight Populhts is up
and at their meeting to-night they took
steps to ascertain whether before Bryan
was nominated his backers and Chairman
Allen did not know that he had wired to
Senator Jones of Arkansas that be would
not accept a nomination at the hands of
the Populists who had repudiated his
running-mate, National Banker Sewall of
Maine. They learned from Governor Stone
of Missouri, who had read the mesÂ«age v
that such was the purport of it, and when
they learned this they saw, as if in a flood
of electric light, every line and wrinkle of
the hideous conspiracy ot which they had

There will be a straight Popnlist ticket
in the field and the politically dccc.it men
and women of that party will be re-en
forced by otheTs who will rebuke the
underhand work of Democratic tricksters.
To prevent this opposition the ex-leaders
of the People's party are still plotting.
They will endeavor to effect the with
drawal of Watson or Sewall, that of Sewall
being preferred, because they have heard

BRYAN IS NOMINATED.
But the National Committee Has
Power to Put Up a New
Ticket if Necessary.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25.â The National
Convention of the People's, party, after
four days of heat, turmoil and unlimited
oratory, completed its labors at 4:40 this
afternoon and adjourned sine die.
Notwithstanding the receipt of one or
more telegrams from W. J. Bryan, declin
ing to permit the use of his name on the
Populist ticket unless Arthur Sewall, his !
associate on the Chicago ticket, was in
dorsed, Mr. Bryan was put in for the
Presidential nominee, as originally con
templated by General Weaver of lowa,
and was seconded by one or more spokes
men from every State and Territory with
about ten exceptions and on a ballot re
ceived 1042 votes against 321 for Colonel
Norton of Chicago, who at the last mo
ment was selected as the candidate of the
unreconstr ucted middle-of-the-road ele
ment.
It was the intention of this faction early
in the morning to place Eugene V. Debs
In nomination and thus force the labor
i~sue to the front, but Debs telegraphed
I declining to serve, and his telegram was
I respected. Strenuous efforts were made
I without avail by Ignatius. Donnelly and
i others to obtain some kind of an assurance
that Mr. Bryan would accept the nomina
tion and stand upon the platform. The
permanent chairman, Senator Allen of
Nebraska, admit ted that he had received
; soaie kind of a telegram from Mr. Bryan,
i but he said he had paid no attention to it
' He also said he had received one supposed
I to be from Governor Stone, but would not
open it until he reached his home in Ne
braska.
Before adjourning the convention
adopted a resolution clothing the National
Committee with plenary powers to do
anything and everything which the con
vention itself might have done if in ses
sion. This, of course, would authorize it
to take down the names of ci her Mr.
Bryan or Mr. Watson or both, if neces
sary, and to construct an entirely new
ticket.
The National Committee was enlarged
so as to consist of three members from
each State and Territory. Bat naturally
the power conferred upon this cumbrous
body will eventually be lodged in an
executive committee of more manageable
size.
A noticeable feature of the last moments
of the convention was the fact that though
the result of the ballot for President was
announced, it was not followed up by any
declaration on the part of the chair that
Mr. Bryan had been duly chosen the can
didate of the People's party for President
of the United States.
The convention separated in bad humor,
many of the delegates openly denouncing
the ticket as a "'theatrical" one. It, how
ever, met the unqualified approval of Mrs.
Lease of Kansas (whose name, usually
printed as "Mary Ellen," was officially
stated to be "Mary Elizabeth"). In an
impassioned address sue assured the dele
gates that they had risen to the grandenr
of the occasion and had done honor to the
party and to themselves.
PLENTY OF ELOQUENCE.
All Kinds of Speeches Made During
the Closing Hours of the
Convention.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25â The conven
tion was called to order by the permanent
chairman, Senator Allen, at 9:40. After
prayer by the Rev. Mr. Kent of Washing
ton the chairman repeated his ruling of !
last night, that the amendment adopted
by the convention giving the nomination
of a Vice-President preference over the
nomination of a President made the selec
tion of National Committeemen the next
order* of business.
J. K. Burnett of California protested
that this was not so, and contended that
the convention simply transposed the
nomination of Vice-Pres:dent and Presi- |
dent.
The chairman replied that the gentle
man's statement of fact was entirely mis
taken, and went on with the naming of
National Committeemen. When this was
completed he called next for committees
on notification.
The chairman announced that the next
order of business was nominations for
President.
Mr. Green of Nebraska got on the plat- :
form to make a motion and a speech. The j
latter was to the effect that this was one
of the most important conventions that
i ever assembled on American soil, as it was '
to name a man who was not only to head
the ticket, but who was to be elected.
At this point the speech was interrupted
by points of order, which irritated Mr.
Green to the extent of making him leave
the stand. He was, however, induced to
comeback, and the rules were suspended I
to enable him to go on in order. He de- !
clared, however, that his self-respect
would prevent him from saying anything,
and he retired for good.
Alabama being called, George Gaither of
that State, addressing his "brothers and
sisters of the convention," yielded to
James B. Weaver, who he said would
name the man who would be ttie running
mate of Tom Watson and run the gold
bugs out of existence.
Mr. Weaver came forward and was pre
sented by the chairman. Mr. Weaver
opened his speech with the remark that
the condition of the People's party this
morning was most << criticaL" He had
but two aspirationsâ one was to preserve
untarnished and unbroken the great
principles of the party, and the other was
to preserve the party organization for
present and future use in every portion of
the country.
He assumed that all delegates had read
in the papers this morning the telegram
from Mr. Bryan declining to accept the
nomination of the People's party disasso
ciated from Mr. Sewall.
"No man," said Mr. Weaver, "could
have done less and be a man. Mr. Bryan's
attitude challenges the respect of every
delegate present, and of every man who
reads the proceedings of this convention.
"But," he continued, "this is a greater
question than the personality of our can
didate. After I read Mr. Bryan's tele
gram I utterly refusedâ and I now utterly
refuseâ to concur with the desire either of
Mr. Bryan or of Benator Jones as to who
shall be the nominee of this convention."
The rest of Mr. Weaver's speech was
read from a type-written copy, and is as
follows:
In that midnight discussion between Brutus
and Cassius concerning the contemplated
battle at Philllppi, Brutus urged thit their
cause was ripe, their legions brimfull, at the
height and ready to decline. Baid he: "There
is a tide in the affairs ot men which, taken at
the flood, leads oa to fortune. Omitted, all the
voyage oi their life is bound In shallows and
in "miseries."
And then in dramatic cllm&x be exclaimed:
"On such a full sea we are now afloat and we
must take the current when it serves or lose
our ventures."
For twenty years we have been pleading
with the people to espouse the sacred cause
which is at stake in this campaign. We have
constantly urged through good and through
evil report that our principles were more im
portant than parly associations ; were above
all considerations of private fortune or the
petty and feverish ambition* of men. We have
thus far suited our action to our words.
Through five Presidential campaigns,
stretching from 1876 to 1892, yon correctly
estimated the purposes of old party managers,
and events have sustained every specification
in your indictment against them. Millions of
honest men within old party ranks were de
ceived, lured into ambush and betrayed. But
not a single one of your pickets has ever been
caught napping or been taken by surprise. To
your devoted efforts is largely due the revival
of economic learning in this country, which
has enabled the Democratic party to assume
its present admirable attitude. Your work
now promises much to mankind, and Is about
to break forth in complete victory for the in
dustrial masses. Though oft repulsed by
multitudes whom we would have liberated,
though crucified in return for our kind
ness, through it all we have steadily con
fided in the righteousness of our cau=e and
the good sense of the people. We still believe
that this Nation has a mission to perform,
which bad men will cot be permitted to de
stroy, and recent events indicate that the
nineteenth century is not, after all, to close
with the friends of freedom despondent in the
Western Hemisphere.
Tula country has recently witnessed a new
Pentecost and received another baptism of
fire. The recent convention at Chicago
sounded a bugle call for union which cannot
be misunderstood and go unheeded. In its
patriotic utterances and action it swept away
all middle ground and opened the road to a
more formidable organic alliance. They not
only made union possiDle, thank heaven they
have rendered it inevitable.
From the very beginning our organization
has made party fealiy subordinate to principle.
We will not here reverse ourselves and refuse
tp weeept victory, now so easily within our
reach. We will hot reiuse the proffered as
sistance of at least three million free silver
Democrats and not less than one mill'ou free
silver Republicans slmpiy because they have
shown ttie good sense to come with an'organ
ized army fully equipped and manned for bat
tle. Let them have their own divisions and
army corps. Let them manifest their own
esprit de corps. The field of glory is open to
all competitors who axe fighting for the same
] principles.
The Populists have already shown their
I prowess in many engagements during twenty
years of struggle. If our allies can strike stur
dier blows at plutocracy than can we; If they
can scale the battlements of the gold tower
more gallantly than our old veterans and are
able to plant their colors one foot nearer the
citadel of the enemy than we can ourselves,
let every Populist cheer and supoort them in
their heroic work. We will all march under
the same flag, keep step to tne same music,
face the same toe, share in and shout over the
same triumphs.
We cannot be mistaken concerning the real
issues involved in the struggle of the present
year. It is between the gold standard, gold
bonds and bank currency on the one hand and
the bimetallic standard, no bonds and Govern
ment currency on the other. The people are
asked to choose between enforced idleness,
destitution, debt, bankruptcy and despair on
the one side and an open door of opportunity
under just lawa and normal conditions on the
other.
The situation presents the mightiest civic
question that ever convulsed a civilized na
tion. The conflict can neither be postponed
nor avoided. In the name of the suffering
people I am firm thai this is no time for dis
sensions or party divisions. The supreme
hour of action has arrived. If you would be
victorious you must m&Ke common cause with
the heroic men who dominated the Chicago
convention. No other course is either prudent
or desirable. We are not asked to abandon
our party, nor would it be wise to do so. If it
is to be preserved we will, in my judgment,
have to take the course which I am about to
indicate. The silver Democrats have lined up
as an organization. Now let the Populists,
free-silver Republicans and th? American Sil
ver party do likewise. Form an embattled
square â lmoenetrabe to the confederated gold
power. After due consideration, in which 1
nave fully canvassed every possible phase oi
the subject. 1 have failed to find a single good
reason to justify us in placing a third ticket in
the field.
The exigencies of the hour imperatively de
mand that this shall not be done. I would
not Indorse the distinguished gentlemen nom
inated at Chicago. I would nominate them
outright an' âike them our own and then
share ju tly and r -Wully in their selection.
Thesitua . n ill striklntr verification of the
old adage that !â  "Path of duty is the path of
safety." Take ihi.- cvtilM and" all opposition
will practically disappear from the Southern
and Western States and we can tnen turn our
attention to our parts of the field. Take any
other and you endanger the situation and
strengthen the arm of our common adversary.
If you allow the present happy juncture to
pnss all the neroic work of twenty years will
be thrown to the winds. Our guiding hand
will disappear in the momentous conflict just
when it should be stretched forth to steady
the ark of our covenant. We \vould prove to
the world that we are devoid of capacity to
grasp grest opposition and lacking strength to
grapDle with prodigious emerge in
Tne people have a gallant chimflon in the
field who is leading a revolt against the pin-
I tocraCy of Christendom. Every oppressor,
every plutocrat in tne two hemisphere ti i>
turned hU guns upon him. The subsidized or
gans have opeuly proclaimed that he must be
crushed by any means and hi whatever eon.
The confederated monopolies rmve lain aside
their parties and tlieir polities and arc marcn
ing in hot haste against him. I^t us blgnal to
them io hold the fort, that ive are coming. >nd
tnen hasten to his relief. Gcnt.tmeii, I wiui
to say to you in all earnestness that as-aled as
this gallant fight is by thr sleuth hounds of the
money power of the world you may deliberate
here as you please but yiÂ»u cannot prevent the
I people from rushing to the nuppon of their
recognized defender and leader. If you will
not say the word they will break < ver all re
straints and go themselves, leaders or no
leaders, and may (iotl bless them for ao doing.
Thereiore, in obedience to my highest con
ception of duty, with a solemn conviction that
I am right. I place in nomination f<>rttu- Presi
dency of the United States a tiiotinguUhrci
gentleman, who, let it be remembered, has
already been three times indorsed by the
l'opuiist party of his own ritateâ once for Rep
resentative in Congress, once for United States
Senator and only last week for the Presidency.
I nune that matchless rbampion of the people,
that intrepid foe of corporation greed, that
splendid young statesman, William Jennings
Bryan of Nebraska.
Mr. Bryan's name was received with
| applause, the whole convention standing
ion chairs and waving hats. A gigantic
wooden cross, surmounted by a golden
crownâ thus reversing Mr. Bryan's fa
mous epigramâ was brought in and car
ried around the hall. The guidons of
States were raised and a vociterous at
j tempt was made to raise enthusiasm, but
j with a marked absence of spontaneity.
A portcait of Bryan was displayed and
numerous devices were carried around the
hall.
All the States joined in the demon
stration except Missouri, Texas, Rhode
Inland and Wisconsin. After the hippo
drome performance had lasted nearly
twenty minutes the convention was called
to order.
General Field of Virginia came to the
front and, in a short, impassioned bpeecb,
declared Mr. Bryan the choice of the Vir
ginia delegation, and declared that al
though no music had been provided, the
convention was marching to "the music
of the spheres"; that victory "stands tip
toe on the mountain tops, and that all
the convention had to do was to ac
cept it."
"Now, gentlemen of the jury," he went
on â "I mean, gentlemen of the conven
tion [laughter], I move that the rules be
suspended and that the nomination of W.
J. Bryan be declared unanimously,"
The chairman put the question, and
two-thirds of the delegates rose with vo
ciferous shouts of "Aye. aye." This cry,
however, was accompanied by the coun
ter cry of "No, no. call roll of States."
Several of the most excited opponents got
on the platform and angrily prevented the
chairman from declaring the result of the
vote.
During the uproar "Btump" Ashby of
Texas managed to obtain a hearing. He
saiu that the State of Texas had already ,

(tolled 165,000 Populist votes, and be
wanted to know for what other State that
'act could be asserted. Texas had never
joined "in those loud, shouting mobs."
[Derisive cheers. ] Texas was ready to ki
lorse Mr. Bryan if Mr. Bryan would in
lorse the Populist platform. To indorse
aim without that would be tho act of
Children. [Cheers.]
Mr. Howard of Alabama asked by what
authority the chairman had recognized a
jentleman from West Virginia before his
State bad been called, to move a sospen
lion of tbe rules and a call of States on
She nomination of Bryan, thu* shutting
off all other nominations. Such gag rule
had heretofore been unknown in Populist
Conventions.
The chair said the gentleman from West
Virginia had been accorded the floor in
(he time of the delegation for Arkansas.
A. delegate in the rear asked the "repeater"
to tell him what was going on, and another
ielegate angrily retorted: "This whole
convention is stacked with repeaters."
The utmost confusion was prevailing all
}his time and it was simply impossible to
bbtain an accurate idea of the condition
)f business.
The roilcall was interrupted to allow the
reading of a telegram to one of the dele
gates. It was:
Please do not permit nse of my name for
nomination. ErGE*z V. Debs.
The motion to suspend the rules was
Understood to be withdrawn, and the call
pf Slates for the Presidential nomination
was resumed. When California was
reached Thomas V. Cator of that State
came to the stand and spoke of the neces
eity oJ acting calmly, coolly and justly in
this preat crisis which had come unex
pectedly to the People's party. A, iong
and flowery oration was wound up by the
nomination of William J. Bryan, to
nomination another California del
egate objected.
The call of States was then continued,
Mr. Kolb of Alabama in the chair.
When the State oi Georgia was called
t'.v. Hunt of that State seconded the nom
ination of Mr. Bryan and predicted an on
ward march to "victory and triumph. 1 '
Colonel Claggett respond d to the call
Of Idaho and seconded the Domination of
Bryan. It seemed, to him that ii would
be a crime against liberty, a crime against
humanity, if the convention failed to se
cure the union of the great masses of the
common people.
When the State of Illinois was called
the nomination of Bryan was seconded by
Mr. Taubeneck. Indian Territory also
seconded it. lowa yielded its time to Mr.
Kolb of Alabama, who (vacating the
chair) addressed the convention in a
â peech seconding the nomination of
Bryan, whom he eulogized as a peerless
Statesman; as one who would, if elected
President, tee that the free and unlimited
coinage of silver should be re-estabiishea
and the golden god of Wall street de
throned.
When the State of Kansas was called
Jerry Simpson tnads a short speech sec
onding the nomination of Mr. Bryan and
eulogizing him.
The delegates from Louisiana put for
ward as their orator a handsome brown
haired young woman, Mrs. Roberts of
Colorado, who informed the convention
that she came from a State where men
had the courage and the chivalry to grant
to women the right which they demanded
for themselves.
"We of Colorado," she exclaimed, "I
mean we of Louisiana [laughter] second
the nomination of Mr. Bryan." Mrs.
Roberts withdrew amid applause.
Henry W. Call of New York was deputed
to speak for Maine. He spoke of the pro
posed "marriage" between Populism a.nd
Democracy, declared that he knew of a
just and lawful impediment, and ex
claimed that f in the name of the common
wealth, he forbade the banns. [Laughter.]
He was proceeding to eppose the nomina
tion of Mr. Bryan when the chairman
(Senator Allen) called the attention of the
Maine delegation to the fact that it was
understood to second Mr. Bryan's nomi
nation. The chairman proved to be right,
and Mr. Field of Virginia declared angrily
that Call was abusing the confidence of the
convention and was not a Populist at all-
The chairman asked of the New York
delegation whether Mr. Call was a dele
gate, and the answer was that be had been
a member of the People's party only two
weeks and had attended only one meet
ing. Mr. Call, who was finally allowed to
proceed, concluded by nominating Hon.
G. F. Norton of Chicago.
R. Gerry Brown of Massachusetts spoke
for his State. He said he was no longer
for bis party ; he was here for his country.
There was no party. On both sides there
were two forces fighting, and there was no
middle of the road. Whoever was in the
middle of the road was deadâ gone down
before the fighting. [Cheert.] It was
either a fight for Mr. Bryan or a fight for
bell and damnation in this eonntry.
[Cheers.] In behalf of the twenty rotes of
Massachusetts he seconded the nomina
tion of William J. Bryan. [Cheers.]
Mr. Donnelly of Minnesota, amid ap
plause, spoke for the nomination of Mr.
Bryan under existing circumstances, even
though he had heretofore opposed it.
Edward S. Greece of Detroit, from the
Michigan delegation, seconded the nomi
nation of Bryan.
Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Lea? e was next in
troduced by the chairman and was warmly
cheered. Advancing to the front of the
platform, she delivered in ringing tones,
Which reached every part of the hall, an
eloquent appeal for unity.
"You hare been equal to the great re
sponsibility placed upon you," she said.
"You have demonstrated your emancipa
tion from the dictation of party pressure
and party rule. I came to this conven
tion to-day wearing a Bryan badge for the
first time, determined, no matter what
might be the action of the convention,
that from now until November I would
support William J. Bryan, and we will
elect him the next President of the United
States." [Cheers.]
Missouri being called, the chairman of
the delegation, Mr. Livingstone, nomi
nated Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota.
Mr. Donnelly, from his Beat, remarked,
"I decline."
Then Mr. Livingstone, saying thai be
spoke only for himself and not for the
delegation, substituted the name of J. S.
Coxey. [Laughter and applause.]
Mr. Smith of Montana and W. L. Green
of Nebraska seconded the nomination of
Bryan.
J. L. Haddox, a delegate from West Vir
ginia, raised a storm of opposition against
the nomination of Bryan, and stated that
inasmuch as he was instructed to do all
he could to defeat Bryan he was com
pelled to cease further participation in the
work of the convention. Thus did the
fcrst bolter retire from the ball.
Mr. Kitchen of North Carolina indorsed
Bryan, and then a tinge of humor was im
parted to the proceedings by the chairman
of the New Jersey delegation, who, "guy
ing" the stilled rhapsodies with which the
convention bad been satisfied, said he had
an eloquent speech prepared. "I have it
in my pocket, n he said, pulling out a big
roll of typewritten manuscript, "but I
cannot speak without the band, and the
band is dead. 1 therefore ask leave to in
sert it in.the record."
This sally was received with applause
and laughter.
Still this did not prevent the ceaseless
flow of oratory. Every State, when called,
sent at least one spokesman to the stand
to shout out the same old platitudes over
again.
Livingstone of Missouri withdrew the
nomination of Coxey.
''Cyclone" Davis of Texas made a short
end rapid speech, seconding the nomina
tion of Norton of Chicago, and suggesting
that if Bryan should not accept the nomi
nation it should be given to the person re
ceiving the next highest number of votes.
New Mexico put forward Miss Alice
Helen Mitchell of Abilene, Kans., and
that talented young lady entertained the
convention with a recitation of an origi
nal piece (with political points), showing
"where the goldbugs go." The last verse
depicted Chauncey Depew awakening from
a dream and shouting, "Sllverl Silver at
last!"
Another poem was inflicted on the con
vention by a Mr. Reynolds, who was put
forward by the delegates from Vermont.
It closed with an appeal to stand by the
leader (Bryan), and declared that they
would "elect him by ltt to L"
Major Beverley of Virginia spoke for his
State and in favor of Bryan. He charac
terised the gold conspirators as "men
who would gamble with the ghost of Judas
Iscariot for the thirty pieces of silver that
he received for his betrayal of Christ"
B. H. Gates spoke for West Virginia in
seconding tbe nomination of Bryan, but
another West Virginia delegate (Hayes)
spoke in favor of Norton.
Maguire spoke for the State of Washing
ton and said her delegates would give
seventeen votes to Bryan, but another
Washington delegate declared that six
votes would be given for Norton.
Brbwn spoke for Wyoming and sec
onded the nomination of Bryan. Arizona
also seconded Bryan's nomination.
The District of Columbia desired to be
beard by Rev. Mr. Kent, who was ap
plauded Â«s he came on the platform. He
counseled moderation and declared that
there was nothing in the Democratic plat
form inconsistent with tbe Populist plat
form, but that it was in some respects
grander. "Why not, then," he said,
"stand together and fight for victory,
prosperity and happiness?"
Bray of Oklahoma seconded Bryan's
nomination and put the question whether
Wat3on would accept a Democrat as his
running mate. Judge Crosby of Missouri
declared he was a Populist of the middle
of-the-road, but that he knew where the
road limits were. The Democratic party
would not swallow the Populists for the
Populists bad already swallowed the Dem
ocratic party. But they would march
together to victory with Bryan at their
head. [Cheers.]
The call of States for nominations was
finished at 3:30 and then the vote was
called for. The vote was interfered with
for several minutes while Mr. Vallette of
Rhode Island â the same who was uncere
moniously hustled off the platform yester
day â made an effort to get a bearing. He
got on his chair, shouted and gesticulated
furiously and was finally pulled away by
officers of the convention, shouting out
that be had come here to "protect the
rights of the American people."
At this point the chairman informed
the convention tbit It would be necessary
to give to tbe National committee plenary
power (after the convention) to do all tbe
things the convention itself could do.
Thus absolutely and unrestricted author
ity has been conferred on the National
Committee over all matters in which the
party is interested.
At 3:40 the call of States was com
menced for votes on tbe Presidential
nominations, the two candidates bein ;
Bryan of Nebraska and Norton of Illinois.
The call of the roll of States was finished
at 4:o6 o'clock, with Bryan nominated by
an immense majority.
Before the announcement of the result
Ignatius Donnelly rose to what he called
"a auestion of information." He under
stood that Mr. Bryan had sent a telegram
to a gentleman on the platform, in which
he positively refused the Populist nomi
nation. He thought it just and right for
the convention to know whether that was
trtfe or not.
"The regular order is called for," said
the chairman, and no other reply was
made.
At 4:22 p. m. the result was officially an
nounced as follows: For Norton, 321 votes;
for Brysn, 1042 votes.
Before the secretary could finish tbe an
nouncement the usual uproar was begun.
The vote in detail is as follows:

The huge crucifix, with its gilded crown
and its cross arm and with inscriptions
from Bryan's speech on both, was carried
at the bead of a noisy mob of boys appar
ently recruited for the occasion. It was
followed by flags, banners and State guid
ons. Deafening yells, whistles and cat
calls were kept up industriously although
it was quite evident that the delegates as
a whole took little Dart in the demonstra
tion.
When there was a comparative lull in
the tumult a motion was made by a dele
gate in the center isle that the convention
adjourn without delay. The chairman
pounded with his ravel and tried in vain
to restore order. After some time, how
ever, and without a formal statement as
to the nomination ot Bryan he put the
question, declared it carried and at 4:40 p.
m. the convention adjourned sine die.

MAJORITY ARROGANCE.
Joseph Asbury Johnson Tells of
the Successful Battle Waged
by Southern Delegates.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25â The great
convention is over. It is Br. v. Since its
close this afternoon I have interviewed
the first men of eighteen States on the
outcome of the convention and shall now
condense the whole into a brief statement,
to which X will add a more complete sur
vey to-morrow. Details ana gossip, how
ever entertaining, are not to my purpose
and are omitted. -
This has been a day of profound serious
r*ess. Tbe pathos of the situation was at
times overwhelming. Many men shed
tears, and often before their eyes were
dried some irresistably ludicrous thing
moved the vast, eaeer and often angry
mess to uproarious laughter. The impas
sioned appeals of Mrs. Lease, Cyclone
Daris and E. Gerry Browne evoked emo
tions which held the stoutest hearts en
thralled. Mrs. Lease spoke for the great
States which lie in the basin of the Mis
sissippi, Davis for the Gulf States and
Browne for the Middle and New England
States. Ihey were barely first, with five
times their number a close second, and all
pleaded for union. All alike put country
above party.
They stood facing a present crisis. Au
dience and speakers trembled under the
weight of a responsibility which all felt to
be well nigh too great for any one to bear.
Moments of passion, like tidal waves,
swept over the assembled thousands. At
times it seemed as if one word too much
would bring on chaos. At the critical mo
ment, feelings found relief in loud-voiced
laughter. "There is but a step between
tbe sublime and the ridiculous," and how
often it was taken to-day.
Thoughtful men see much in the net re
sults of the convention to make them
prave. The apparent victors, whose com
pact union and skilled generalship was
directed with unrelenting persistency
against disorganized and divided forces,
seem less certain that they are masters of
the situation than this seemingly over
whelmed minority. In lieu of real assur
ance, they assumed an air of insolent au
thority and superiority, which at times
came perilously near forcing an open re
volt
The set faces and gleaming eyes of the
routed minority were well matched by the
low-spoken but electric words with which
they denied defeat and defied presump
tion. And yet in their hearts they longed
for an actual and cordial union. Don
nelly said to me: "There will be a feli
citous and durable union of forces as the
result of the work now consummated, pro
vided there is untarnished Honor in keep
ing the spirit and letter also of this com
pact. The South has yielded much; it
can yield no more. Watson must hold the
second place in good faith and Sewall must
make good the claim of his Democratic
friendi that his patriotism overtops his
partisan pride and his ambition for office.
It now depends upon Sewall. The South
shall not be defrauded."
This was said quietly, but his lips
trembled, his, chest heaved and his tones
vibrated. So spoke many others.
Davis said: "My brother, you ask me
for ultimate thought, and I gladly give it;
my people in the South are in sore straits,
for their sole barrier and protector against
the brutal tyrrany of bourbon gold De- (
mocracy is tae.People's party. Make that
tbe instrumentality of our deliverance and
we are saved; destroy it, and you turn us
over to the merciless enemy, official and
machine Democracy, and I tell you, all is
lost. Give us Watson, with honor and a
fair deal, and we are irresistible, the bat
tle is won. We cannot take Sewall. Our
people would rather have McKinley. We
would suffer less and would retain our
party in untarnished honor. No Southern
Populist will vote for Bryan and Sewall.
On a fair deal, every man of us will vote for
Bryan and Watson. We shall wait and
see."
Gerry Browne of Massachusetts, recent
Populist candidate for Governor of that
State, takes this view :
"I am free to cay that I regard parties
solely as political instrumentalities, whose
usefulness ceases when they either become
corrupt or fail to reacn and guide the peo
ple. I now frankly say, Mr. Johnson,
that if the union this day accomplished is
to bring together the friends of toiling
millions, and will wrest the Government
of this country from tbe greedy clutch of
gold men, I care not under wnat party
name the work is done. I shall go on in
good faith till I am met with bad faith
from our new allies. If that is to be our
portion under tbe new compact I quit it.
I shall still cherish the People's party,
and go on with our work of education.
We shall have the Republican gold policy
four years. You know what that means.
The people will know. In 1900 we bhall
all be together in a people's party of some
kind, and deliverance will come. Better
the destruction of Democracy and the
growth of a new party than a sham victory
with dishonest allies. We shall not long
be in doubt. We may trust the people."
To-morrow I shall refer in particular to
tbe interests which molded the conven
tion, and name responsible persons. VTe
begin our homeward journey at 9p. m. to
morrow. Most of us will return by the
same route we came and in the same car.
Joseph Asbuky Johxson.
NORTON THEIR CHOICE.
Mlddle-of-the-Road Populists Meet,
Express Indignation and Issue
an Address.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25.â Immediately
after the adjournment of the convention
the Texas delegation took charge o! the
hall and invited all the middle-of-the-road
Populists to hold a caucus for tne purpose
of drawing up a statement to the public
showing their position in the campaign.
A committee of three was selected to in
quire of Governor Stone whether or not he
had received any telegram Jrom Bryan in
which be declined to stand on the piat>
I form adopted by tne People's party. The
Texas delegation favored supporting
Bryan if be would agree to stand on. the
Populist platform.
Mr. Wash burn of Massachusetts made a
short address, in which he said he had re
ceived a telegram from Mr. Bryan which
stated that be was willing to trust the re
sult of the convention to the good sense of
the Populist party, and that all be asked
in return was that the convention trust
bim likewise.
He said further that Mr. Byran bad
given him assurances thai if it were possi
ble to do, in connection witn the Demo
cratic platform, he would stand on the
platform adopted by the populists. He
also said that be unherstood that Mr.
Bryan was perfectly willing to stand on
the platform with Watson. A resolution
LANE'S MESSAGE TO "THE CALL."
ST. tOUIS, Mo., July 35.â Charles M. Shortridge, Editor and Proprietor
"The Call": At the invitation of your representative, Mr. Frank McGulre, I
avail myself of your kindness to send through "The Call," which has with
great fairness printed both sides of this great currency discussion, my greetings
to California.
1 do not think the action of the Populists to-day will injure Bryan. It may,
however, injure the Populist party. ThU is not a question of party. It Is a
question of the producing classes against the miejudgraent of the moneyed
classes. The National Silver party is one in which all friends of humanity,
regardless of party prejudice, can unite. CHAKLES D. LANE,
Chairman Silver National Committee.
was offered by Judge Wood of Texas, as
follows:
''In case William J. Bryan does not ac
cept the nomination on the platform with
Tom Watson inside of thirty days, the
Hon. S. F. Norton be declared the nomi
nee of the People's party."
A committee was appointed, consisting
of a delegate from each State present for
the purpose of drawing up a statement
showing the public the position taken by
the middle-of-the-roaders, eighteen
States responded and named a member of
this committee. "Stump" Ashby of Texas
presided and Sheridan Webster of Mis
souri was secretary of the meeting. With
out adopting the resolution an adjourn
ment wad taken until 7:30 this evening.
The meeting to-night proved a fiasco.
Not more than twenty delegates respond
ed to the call. Colonel Norton made a
speech in which he advised the hotheads
to go slowly. He said:
"I simply say to you Texans, wait until
your convention on August 5, lay the
matter before it and I am with you in any
course you decide to take. By August 5
we will know wbeiher Mr. Bryan will ac
cept the nomination or not You will
know whether Tom Wataon is on the
ticket. I have no faith in the National
Committee. It is owned body, soul and
breeches by the Bryan people. It pos
sesses absolute control over the affairs of
the People's party for the next four'
years."
After Colonel Norton left the room
John Ulrich of Wisconsin, of the commit
tee appointed to wait oa Governor Stone
and ask for the alleged telegram from Mr.
Bryan, reported that they had seen Gov
ernor Stone and he had informed them
that, in his opinion, Mr. Bryan did not
intend to accept the Populist nomination.
A committee was appointed to draw up
an address to the American people,. and
the address was laid on the table.
It charged that the convention was not
Populistic, but was conducted in the inter
est and under the direction of the National
chairman of the Democratic party ; that
hired emissaries were sent among the dele
gates to influence them by questionable
means; thatW. J. Bryan's nomination was
procured by misrepresentation and the
suppression of telegrams of declination
from him.
The address recommended that in case
Mr. Bryan does not formally accept the
nomination by August 5 noxt bis silence
be tauen as a declination, and that Hon.
S. F. Norton of Illinois, who received the
votes of the midilla-of-the-road Populists
be considered the nominee of the People's
party.
In place of the address the rapidly dwin
dling crowd adopted a resolution as fol
lows:
Resolved, That we, the minority, known as
the middle-of-the-road people, enter our sol
emn protest against the arbitrary methods of
tho?e in control of the convention.
WILL ACCEPT, OF COURSE.
Bryan Says His Action Depends
Upon the Conditions Attached
by the Populists.
' LINCOLN, Neb*., July 28.â William J.
Bryan told tbe United Press representa
tive to-night that his action with regard
to the Populist National ticket would
depend entirely on the conditions attached
to his nomination. In answer to a ques
tion concerning the matter he said:
"When the Populists decided to nomi
nate the Vice-President first Senator Jones,
Chairman of the National Democratic
Committee, wired me as follows: 'Popu
lists nominate Vice- President first. If not
Sewall, what shall we do? Answer quick.
I favor your declination in that case.' I
wired immediately as follows: 'I entirely
agree with you. Withdraw my name if
Sewall is not nominated.'
"These dispatches were published in
this morning's papers and tbe convention
understood my position. In spite of this,
they have seen fit to nominate me.
Whether 1 shall accept tho nomination or
not will depend entirely upon what con
ditions are attached to it. My first desire
is to aid in securing the immediate restor
ation by the United States of the free and
unlimited coinage of gold and silver at
the present legal ratio oi 16 tc 1, without
waiting tor the aid or consent of any other
nation. Tbe Republican platform de
clares that the bimetallism system should
be restored, but asserts that we, as a
people, are helpless to secure bimetallism
for ourselves until foreisn nations come to
our assistance. We cannot afford to sur
render our right to legislate for our people
upon every question, and so long as the
right is disputed no other question can
approach its importance.
"I appreciate the decision manifested at
St. Louis to consolidate all the silver
forces and reeret that they did not nom
inate Mr. Sewali also. He stands squarely
apon the Chicago platform and has de
fended our cause against greater opposi
tion than we have had to meet in the West
and South. The Populist platform is, on
many questions, substantially identical
with the Chicago platform; it goes be
yond the Chicago platform, however, and
indorses some policies which Ido not ap
prove of. All that I can say now fs that
my action will depend entirely upon the
conditions attached to the nomination. I
shall do nothing which will endanger the
success oi bimetallism, nor shall I do any
thing unfair to Mr. Sewall."
Mr. Bryan spent the day dictating. to
his stenographer and reading letters. He
drove downtown ih the afternoon with his
law partner, A. R. Talbot. The bulletins
from the St. Louis convention were sent
bim over his telephone from downtown.
Senator Jones of Arkansas, chairman of
tbe Democratic National Committee, will
be in Lincoln to-morrow. His principal
business here will be to consult with Mr.
Bryan about the advisability of accepting
or declining tbe Populist nomination.
There are a number of other matters to be
arranged between the two, and it is not
unlike that, as a result of their confer
ence, something will be arranged concern
ing the date of the notification meeting in
New York and Mr. Bryan's itinerary from
Lincoln to tbe metropolis.
Senator Stewart of Nevada, who has
been attending the Populist Convention,
will also be in Lincoln to-day.

BUTLER IS CHAIRMAN.
The New National Populist Com
mittee Organized for the Com
ing Campaign.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25.â Tbe first
meeting of the new National Populist com
mittee was held this evening at the Lin
dell Hotel and started in with as much
promise for debate as was exhibited in the
convention that created it.
This propensity for discussion was so ir
repressible that one of the members called
attention to the fact that the campaign
lasted but four months and it was imper-
I ative that the committee organize beiore
that period ot time had elapsed.
The committee was called to order short-
I ly alter 8 o'clock by ex-Congressman Lafe
â  Pence of New York, and after much dis
cussion the following gentlemen were
placed in nomination for chairman of the
committee: Senator Marion F. Butler of
North Carolina, General James B. Weaver
of .lowa, Judge H. L. Bentley of Texas,
Senator William V. Alien of Nebraska,
John W. Breidenthal of Kansas.
On the nrat -ballot the result was as fol
lows: Butler 46, Weaver 20, Bentley 6,
Allen 29 and Breidentbal 19. As 61 votes
were necessary, there was no choice.
The second ballot resulted in the elec
tion of Senator Butler as follows: Butler
j 65, Weaver 10, Allen 35 and Breidenthal 13.
J. A. Edgerton of Nebraska was elected
secretary and M. C. Rankin of Indiana
treasurer. Messrs. J. R. Sovereign of
! Arkansas, C. F. Taylor of Pennsylvania,
j H. W. Reed of Georgia, Frank Burkitt of
i Mississippi,. G. F. Washburn of Washing
j ton and J. K. Breidenthai of Kansas were
selected as members of the executive com
mittee.
Mr. Burkitt resigned, and on his motion
J. S. Dore of California was placed on the
committee in his place. Mr. Burkitt did
this to give the Pacific Coast representa
tion on the executive committee. The
committee adjourned subject to tbe call
of the chair.
WATSON WILL ACCEPT.
' Says the Demand for Fusion Was
1 Yso Great That It Could Not Be
Withstood.
1 AUGUSTA, Ga., July 25.â A United
' Press representative saw Thomas E. \Vat
â  soo, the Populist nominee for the Vice
\ Presidency, at his home to-day in Thomp
son, Ga. He said :
"I will accept the nomination. I yea,ter
-1 day. wired my friends in St. Louis to that
' effect. Under the circumstances I did
| what I believed to be best for all in
'_ terested. I was originally for a straight
; out ' Populist platform and a straight-out
' Populist ticket, but the demand for fusion
' was so great it : could not be withstood.
Total fusion, or adoption of the entire
1 I Democratic ticket, would have killed the
1 party it preserved. If Mr. Bryan accepts
' the ' Populist nomination I believe our
ticket will be elected."
| "Upon what do you base your belief ?"
'â¢ "The common' ticket will carry the
1 Solid South and West with 233 votes, when
224 are necessary to a* choice. Besides
' . there are Eastern and Northern States
that are debatable ground. The only
' doubt before the supremacy of the Popu
list party in the West is the Democratic
' party, and with the votes of this party we
', could carry the West.
'â¢A union of the strength of the two will
' carry both sections solidly. I fully indorse
-. the platform. The only difference be
' tween the Democratic and the Populist
' platforms is that the Populist goes fur
ther. Mr. Bryan and I were friends in
y the Fifty-second Congress and, I believe,
' voted together on every measure that
L ; came before the House." .

ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25.â Senator Jones,
chairman of the Democratic National Com
mittee, left St. Louis at 8 o'clock for Lin
coln, Nebr., where he goes to confer with
the party candidates. Senator Jones de
clined to say anything more than he has
heretofore said relative to the result of tbe
Populist Convention. He has not yet
given the question of the location of head
quarters sufficient consideration and will
not take up that matter for settlement for
several days. While in this city Mr. Jones
determined upon one member of the ex
ecutive committee, which he was author
ized to appoint, and named William
P. St. John. This was done in tbe follow
ing letter addressed to Mr. 8U John under
to-day's date:
â¢Vy Dear Sir; I have taken the liberty of ap
pointing yon treaantr of the Democratic
National Commutes and hope that you will,
without delay, enter udou the duties of the
position. Very respectfully,
Jakes K. Jones.
Mr. Bt. John is in tbe city and was a
leading factor in tbe Silver Convention,
which adjourned yesterday and over
which he presided as permanent chair
man. He promptly addressed a note to

Failure, but Accept Defeat
Graceful y.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25.â Senator Stew
art of Nevada was in a better frame of
mind to-night than be was after being
hooted down by tbe Populist convention
when be attempted to address it yesterday
evening.
"I am satisfied with the result," said tbe
Senator as be quaffed a soda lemonade at
the cafe of the Planters this evening. "It
was the best we could do. The nomina
tion of Watson will not affect Bryan's
chances in the least. It rather favors bim,
since the middle of tbe road Populists will
now remain in line."
"Will Mr. Bryan accept the nomina
tion?"
"Well, be can't very well reject it," re
plied the Senator.
"Will it be tendered him?"
"We have the road guarded between
here and Lincoln to-night," said the Ne
vadan with a smile, "and the first person
who is caught beading for Bryan's home
to tell him of bis nomination will be ap
prehended."
Senator Stewart was "redheaded)," to
use a slang expression, when turned down
by the Populist convention last night
He kept the late watch with a number of
newspaper correspondents at the Planters'
and cursed in long sentences, tbe Populist
party in general and the !middle-of-the
road men in particular. He was exaspe
rated by tbe insult tbe convention had
offered bim, but neglected to recite the fact
that be was not a delegate to the conven
tion and was regarded by many as an in
terloper. His beart bled from the wounds
made by the shafts of derision fired by
friends of other days. He wavered under
the weight of disappointment. "What an
ignorant, windy gang," be said then. "I
attended the Democratic convention at
Chicago, I was a delegate to tbe Silver
convention at St. Louis and the contrasts
between the Democratic and Silver con
ventions and tbe Populist is anything but
complimentary to the latter. The contrast
is much greater than I ever expected to
find between assemblages of American
citizens."
"Can Mr. Bryan accept the nomination
with Watson on the ticket?" inquired
some one. "Certainly not. He cannot
betray his party by sacrificing Sewall.
He would be a traitor. Mr. Bryan will de
cline a nomination or indorsement. As I
said before, since then be has changed his
mind."
"I am very well pleased with tbe action
of the Populist convention," said William
P. St. John, just as he was leaving for
New York to-night. "It was the only
thing that could be done under the circum
stances, as it would have been impossible
to have placated the Texas delegation
and others from the South. Of course we
should like to have Mr. Sewall on the
ticket, but we could not dictate to the con
vention our terms, since we did not stand
on tbe Populist platform. Tbe deleeates
will all go home and vote for Bryan and
two-thirds of tnem will vote for Sewall
also. Igo away happy in the belief that
we have accomplished much toward bring
ing about the desired reforms in our finan
cial system."
Senator Jones of Nevada left for the
West to-night. He expressed himself as
satisfied with the situation. In their
hearts, however, the silver men hnte the
Populists. The believe that the party
which claims such a large slice of the
lord's grac,e and gratitude has wrecked
itself by its action in refusing to nominate
both Bryan and Sewall. The Populists
declare that if Bryan i 3 defeated tbe
Democracy will be no more and that their
party will be the party of the future. Tbus
as the observer is tossed about upon the
waves of Populist opinion and popular
prejudice, he doubts whether it was better
to be crucified on a cross of silver or gold
or survive at the mercy of the rabble.
The American patriot is thoughtful and
serious. He has his finger upon the pulse
of his country. He is studying tbe his
tory of the parties of Lincoln and Grant,
of Blame and McKinley. He is analyzing
the lives and deeds of Jefferson and Jack
son, Cleveland and Bryan. He is weigh
ing the brains of Sockless Simpson, Gen
eral Coxey and Carl Browne. He sits
during the closing hours of the nineteenth
century and perhaps wonders if it is not
right to give up tbe old party for tbe'new.
but by the ides of November he may think
that it is safer to trust the old friend who
proved always true. Frank McGuire.

Delegates to the Convention
of Window-Glass
Workers.
FOUR HUNDRED STRONG.
Satisfied With Financial Condi
tions, but Want Protection
Restored.
THE MAJOE'S POINTED REPLY.
Reviews the Country's Business De
pression and Shows the Only
Source of Relief,
CANTON, Ohio, July 25.â Perhaps the
most important delegation which has
come to Canton since the nomination of
Major McKinley to call upon him was
that which arrived this morning from
PitUburg. It numbered over 400 and waÂ»
made up of delegates to the eighth Na
tional convention of the Window-glass
Workers from New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Delaware and Maryland, represent
ing the real industrial classes in those
Btates and not the politicians or profes
sional laboring men. Their spokesman,
Henry Bostwick of Indiana, declared that
the issue which appealed most directly,
personally and powerfully to the man who
works in the factory, foundry or shop, is
the tariff.
The workingmen who have visited
Canton, and they have been here in large
numbers, have the notion firmly fixed in
their minds that the present tariff law is
responsible for their present lack of pros
perity. Mr. Bostwick said on this point:
'â¢We want the protective principlel re
stored. We are satisfied with ti.e quality
of onr dollars, and have no fear as to the
volume of our money if the tariff is so
reeulated and levied on such principles as
to host protect American industries and 10
insure sufficient funds to meet the neces
sary expenses of the Government."
This sentiment was the keynote of the
speech. When Major McKinley rose to
respond he was greeted with prolonged
applause and hearty cheer*. He said:
"Nothing could be better said thau that
a great essential to the credit of the coun
try is to provide enough revenue to run
the country. The credit of any Govern
ment is imperiled so long as it expends
more money than it collects. The credit
of ttie Government, like that of the indi
vidual citizen, is best subserved by livine
within its means and providing means
with which to live. Every citizen must
know that tne receipts of the United State?
are now insufficient for its necessary ex
penditures and that our present revenue
lews have resulted in causing a deficiency
in the treasury for almost three years.
''It has been demonstrated, too, that no
relief can be had through the present
Congress. The relief rests with the peo
ple themselves. They are charged with
the election of a new Congress in Novem
ber, which alone can give the needed re
lief. If they elect a Republican Congress
the whole world knows that one of its first
acts will be to put upon the statute books
of the country a law under which the
Government will collect enough money to
meet its expenditures, stop debts and de
ficiencies and adequately protect Ameri
can labor. [Great cheering and applause.]
This would be one of the surest steps to
ward the return of confidence and a re
vival of business prosperity. [Applause.]
"The Government, my fellow-citizens,
bas not been the only sufferer in the past
three years. The people have suffered â
the laboring man in his work and wages,
the farmer in his prices and markets, and
our citizens generally in their incomes
and investments. Enforced idleness
among our people has brought to many a
man's home gloom and wretcnedness
where cheer and nope once dwelled. Both
Government and people have paid dearly
for a mistaken policy, a policy which has
disturbed our industries and cut down our
revenues, always so essential to our credit
and independence and prosperity.
"A new experiment Is now proposed;
one that would debase our currency and
further weaken if not wholly destroy pub
lic confidence. Circumstances, gentlemen,
have given to the Republican party at this
juncture of our National affairs a place of
supreme responsibility and duty. Seldom,
if ever, has a political party occupied a
post of such high importance as that in
trusted to tne Republican party this year.
Indeed, it may be confidently asserted that
never has any political organization been
so clearly and conspicuously called to do
battle for so much that is best in
government. But happily it will not
contend alone. It will number among
its allies, friends and supporters thou
sands of brave citizens and political oppo
nents of the past, who will join our ranks
and make common cause in resisting the
proposed debasement of our currency, the
degradation of our country's honor, and
in upholding the continued supremacy of
law and orderâ this strongest and might
iest piilar of free government. [Great ap
plause.]
"The whole country rejoices to-day that
the strong and sturdy men who toil are
enlisted in the cause of American honor,
American patriotism, American produc
tion and American prosperity â a cause
which must sureiy win before the great
tribunal of the American people." [Tre
mendous applause.]
Major McKinley had a unique call this
afternoon. A party of Baltimore and
Ohio Railway officials, with half a dozen
well-known citizens of Canton, drove up
to the McKinley residence in a tally-ho.
Behind the tally-ho was an express wagon
and in it was a huge pilded basket con
taining a big watermelon. Judge Baldwin
of Canton presented the melon to Major
McKinley on behalf of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad employes. It came from
Georgia, and was obtained through the
efforts of N. W. Mitchell of the Baltimore
and Onio, who offered a prize for the two
largest melons grown there this year.
One was presented to Major McKinJey
and the other is to be presented to Mr.
Bryan. The Baltimore and Ohio em
ployes authorize! Ju<Jf.'e Baldwin to say
for them that thÂ«y would support him in
the November election.

ENCOURAGING REPORTS.
Men From Various Seotlons Tell
How McKinley Will Carry the
Country.
CHICAGO, 111., July 25.â Congressman
J. W. Babcock of Wisconsin, who is chair
man of the Republican Congressional
Committee, spent part of to-day at the
party's campaign headquarters, conferring
with Chief Heath and Committeeman
Dawes and giving them interesting in
formation.
He said that for the last month three of
the bigge&t printing establishments in
Philadelphia and Baltimore had been
working their presses night and day turn
ing out millions of Congressional docu
ments on the currency question, fiirures,
statistics, etc., in leaflet and pamphlet
form to meet the unprecedented demand
from all the States in the Union.
All these documents were distributed
under the Congressional franking privi
lege and Congressman Babcock declared
that never had there been such a demand
for public documents in a campaign.
A prominent caller was ex-Governor
Merriam of Minnesota. He said cam
paign speeches were already working his
State, which he placed in the sure Repub
lican column by a majority of 40,000.
To a United Press reporter he said that
Congressman Towne, the bolting Repub
lican from the Sixth (Duluth) District,
would run independent and that the Re
publicans have nominated a man who
would beat him on the silver issueâ Judge
Page Morris, a Virginian.
Henry T. Oxnard, the sugar-beet grower
in Nebraska, who is also interested in
the sugar-cane industry in Louisiana, was
also a visitor at headquarters. He iÂ« a Re
publican, but his brothers are Democrats.
He told Mr. Heath that one-third of the
farming people in Nebraska were directly
I interested in the beet-sugar industry, and
that one-half of the people were affected
by the anti-sugar bounty legislation of the
last Democratic Congress. Mr. Oxnard's
belief was that this sugar element would
control the bounty question, and would
result in Louisiana's electoral vote being
given to McKinley.
NATIONAL SILVER PARTY.
Work of thÂ© Committee Completed
With an Appeal for Bryan and
Subscriptions to the Cause.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 25.â The National
Committee of the National Silver party
completed its work to-day and adjourned
subject to the call of Chairman Lane of
California.
On motion of Mr. Baker of California it
whs decided to recommend to the notifica
tion committee that Mr. Bryan be notified
in Baltimore of his selection as the candi
date of the National Silver party.
The following address to the people,
drafted by Mr. St. Jonn, was unanimously
adopted:
National Committee )
Of the National Silver Party, >
St. Locis, Mo., July 24, 1896.)
To tht â¢American People : Inasmuch as it has
been charged upon the National Stiver party
assembled In St. Louis that we are a conven
tion of repudiators, revolutionists and an
archists we submit the following to the candid
judgment of the people:
lit our delegations are 4 veterans of our
Mexican War, 49 ex-Confederates and
196 Union army veterans of the late war. Of
the 731 delegates attending 9 are Prohibition
ists, 49 are Populists, 146 are Democrats and
526 are Republicans.
Under this composition of tbe convention
we appeal to all true patriots, without regard
to previous party affiliations, to vote for Hon.
William J. Bryan for President and Hon.
Arthur Bewail for Vice-President of the United
States. A result of tbeir election will be tbe
restoration of the free coinage of silver on
equal terms with gold, providing thereby a
volume of money which will tend to dissemi
nate rather than to aggregate wealth, which
will relieve the present profound depression
and replace it with a wide prosperity.
We urge you to unite upon this ticket as
your sole hope of escape from the rigors of a
grinding of a gold monopoly.
Ours is a poor man's campaign. We there
fore call for contributions toward legitimate
expenses, the same to be sent to William P. St.
John, treasurer, at 121 East Thirty-fourth
street, New York City. Contributions of $1 or
more will be regularly acknowledged.
FIVE HOURS' FIGHTING,

CHICAGO, 111., July 25.â A special from
Key West says : Twelve of the filibusters
landed in Cuba by the steamer Three
Friends have been killed by the Span
iards, according to letters received here.
The hlibusters, with the arms and ammu

Havana* A small band of insurgents was
I in waiting and took the arms into the
mountains. The filibusters, of whom
there were nearly 100, wero told to wait a
few hours and guides would be sent to
conduct them to the insurgent camp.
While waning they were discovered by
a Spanish column. The filibusters fled
into the forests and for four days were
without food. On the fifth day, after
some had died of heat and exhaustion,
I they m<;t some insurgent scouts, who un
dertook to trmde them to a place of safety.
Soon after meeting the scouts they ran
into a Spanish column and were shot to
death.
Gabriel Official! and Louis Paroll of Key

and Fearce Atkinson, who is related to a
Jacksonville family, were among the
killed. Omciall, Floyd and Atkinson were

has relatives in Illinois. The names of
the other eight men killed have not been

The other members of the expedition

ing reached an insurgent camp.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
LATE GOSSIP OF GOTHAM
Penurious Tactics of the Widow
of John Jacob Astor's
Partner.
Another Shade of Life in the Metrop.
olis Shown by the Starvation
of a Family.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 25.â Though
aged and wÂ«ll-to-do, Antoinette L. Scher
merhorn, widow of the Rev. Dr. John
Schermernorn and daughter of the orig
inal John Jacob Astor's former partner,
was examined as a judgment debtor yes
terday in proceedings supplementary to a
judgment of $1389 for legal services by
Â£rastus Benn, for a long time her confi- j
dential attorney. She submitted to the
lawyer's questions with bad grace, and it
was only after the most rigid examination,
which established her ability to satisfy tne
judgment, that she consented to pay and
the proceedings closed.
Mrs. Schermerhorn's father, Francis L.
Lasak, who early in the century was in the
fur business with John Jacob Astor I, left
$5,000,000, but cut the daughter off with a
life interest in $30,000, leaving the residue
of his estate to his eight other children.
Mrs. Scnermerhorn's contest of the will
ended in a compromise by which she re
ceived almost as much as each of her
brothers and sisters.
Despite her comfortable income Mrs.
Schermerhorn pays only $6 a week for her
furnished rooms at 850 Eighth avenue,
and breakfasts, dines and sups at restau
rants.
Mrs. Schmerhorn stated that she had
$50,000 with the Brooklyn Trust Company
and $30,000 with a similar corporation, and
that she received $1200 a year from the
latter investment.
"How much do you pay for your board ?"
"I pay $6 a week for my room. I eat
where I please. Why, do you know, there
was a stretch of seven weeks when I had
only Indian meal to eat, with lard on it,
and once I had only one meal in seven
days."
A sad case of misery and starvation
came to hsht at Westfield, N. J., yester
day. The family of Harry Edwards were
found in the most destitute circumstances,
the wife and mother confined to her bed
by illness and the four children hungry
and in rags.
For two or three days the people pass
ing the Wittkes building on Broad street
had detected the odor of chicken broth,
and when some one remarked upon it, lit
tle Mary Edwards said she made broth for
her mother, who was sick. This led a
neighbor to call, and there in the Ed
wards tenement lay tbe woman, very ill,
the room desolate and she on her bed,
barely covered with a filthy horse blanket
and with an old calico waist for a night
robe. For months she had wonted eigh
teen and twenty hours a day to keep tbe
wolf from her children's tnroats, until at
last she could work no longer. The hus
band and father, dissolute and depraved,
had done nothing for his family, and tbe
mother, forbidding her children to tell
of their circumstances, had finally taken
to her bed, exhausted and unable to repel
disease.
The children with no food and the
mother sick, had gone to the rear of the
meat markets acd there had wrested from
the cats and dogs chickens' heads and
legs, and had made broth for tbeir mother i
and themselves. Charitable people at ,
once provided for the family and called a
physician.
Edwards is a man of education. His
father, a farmer of wealth, was angered at
his marriage with a poor country girl, and
in a quarrel tbe father shot tbe son in the
eye. From that time be has boen sup- '
ported by the brave wife.
There will be no boxing contests at the
Surf Athletic Ciub, at Coney Island, to
night. Mayor Wurster of Brooklyn has
taken an appeal from the decision of Jus
tice Osborne of the Supreme Court, which
ordered him to grant a first-class theater
license to the club.
The appeal will not be heard before
October; but, as Justice Osborne granted a
mandamus, the appeal will not act as a
stay, and. pending the final decision, the
club may get its license temporarily. To
accomplish this, if possible, Justice
Osborne, on the application of the club, {
has given an order directing Mayor Wur- :
ster to show cause why he should not be
punished for contempt for disobeying the
mandamus.
Manager Hamilton of the American Roof
Garden, and Hope Booth, the actress,
called at Jefferson Market Court yesterday
morning and furnished $500 bail each on
tbe charge of giving an immoral per
formance. Their attorney asked that their
case be sent to tbe General Sessions, in
order to secure a trial by jury. It will
probably be heard on Monday.
The Sun says: The wedding of Cornelius
Vanderbilt Jr. and Miss Grace Wilson and
the wedding of Harry Payne Whitney and
Miss Gertrude Vanderbilt will take place
very soon. The dates wilJ be fixed as soon
as Cornelius Vanderbilt Sr. has recovered
his health. He will go to Newport this
summer, in all probability, but will remain
at his home during his convalescence.
DIABOLICAL PLOT FRUSTRATED.
Mutineer Plans to Murder His Captain and
Fin the Vessel's Cargo of
Petroleum.
NEW YORK. N. V., July 25.-A Snn
special from Baltimore says:
The story of a plot to murder the cap- |
tain and set fire to the British oil-tank
steamship Hotham Newton, which sailed
from Baltimore for Amsterdam several
days ago, was told in shipping circles here
yesterday. The steamer carried a cargo of
petroleum. The instigator of the plot is
said to have been an English sailor who
felt aggrieved at the treatment he had re
ceived at the hands of Captain Thomas
Anderson of the steamer. Captain An
derson discovered the plot just in time to
defeat it and put the man in irons. It hÃd
been planned to kill the captain with an j
iron bar as he lay asleep in his berth and
then set fire to the ship, laden with pe
troleum, to destroy all evidence of guilt.
Owing to the fact that the vessel was
ready for sea when the plot was discov
ered and to have prosecuted the mutineer

SICKENING SCENES IN DEBRIS
AT MORRISON.
Traffic Blocked in Many Localities
and Huge Bowlders Cover Rail
road Tracks
DENVER, Colo., July 25.â The heavy
downpour of last night in a few minutes
caused such washouts on several railroad
lines that even with tbe number of men
and the amount of material at hand traffic
cannot be resumed until some time next
week.
On tbe Denver and Rio Grande Railway,
between Suit Creek and San Carlos, below
Pueblo, for a distance of fourteen miles
the track has been undermined in many
places and traffic there will not be moving
nntil Monday.
On the Florence and Cripple Creek it
will require a week's time to repair the
damages, consisting of washouts and rock
slides on the new high line. Dynamite
must be used to break some of tbe bowl
ders which rolled down the mountain
sides upon the high line. Cripple Creek
people will do their traveling by stage for
the ensuing week.
The Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf, in
the vicinity of Golden, has several days'
work to do before trains can be run. The
damage was confined to the vicinity of
Golden, no trouble of importance occur
ring along the route either to Georgetown
or to Central City. The cloudburst evi
dently was most severe on tbe mountains
south of Golden and between that city and
tbe resort village of Morrison.
Another heavy downpour occurred this
afternoon. In ten minutes .70 of an inch
of water fell in Denver, and streetcar traf
fic was suspended for a half hour, while
the flood, mixed with hail, poured down,
quite filling the paved streets from curb to
curb. The storm was also heavy at Golden
and along the mountain west, but no rain
fell elsewhere in tbe State. The total rain
fall to-day was 1.50 inches, but tbe effect
of the flood is due to the speed of its
downpour. - Where confined in canyons,
as at Morrison, the water rushes down in
one mighty wave, sweeping everything
before it, and subsiding almost as quickly
as it fell.
MORRISON, Colo., July 25.â A second
flood this afternoon resulted in completely
paralyzing all efforts to recover the bodies
of those lost in the debris of last night's
floods. The people are worn out with the
excitement and labor of struggling amid
the rubbish brought down the canyon by
the great wall of water which last night
â just at dark surprised th. camping fami
lies along the road above town. At dark
to-night ten bodies had been recovered
and identified. The othsrs are either
buried from sight in the sand or have
been carried further down the stream,
and probably into tbe Piatte Rivei. Re
ports from up the canyon bring the cheer
ing news tuat none of the people there
camping were Jost.
The list of the dead from last night's
flood is as follows:
Mrs. Moses Miller and three children of
Morrison.
Child of J. C. Longnecker of Morrison.
Thomas McGough, aged 21, of Dayton,
Ohio.
Mrs. A. S. Proctor, 32 years old, wife of
A. S. Proctor of Denver.

Miss Delia Homer.
Miss M,ary Homer.
Miss Josephine Holme.
Mrs. Horace M. Warren.
Mr. and Mrs. H. M. Warren Jr., wbo are
well known in Brooklyn society, where
their relatives and friends reside, came up
from Denver yesterday on the afternoon
train to spend Saturday and Sunday at the
Homer ranca, up Mount Vernon canyon.
Tbey were met at the station of the Lake
wood Railroad at Golden by the Misses
Homer and Miss Josephine Holme, also of
Denver, and started for the ranch. The
flood overtook them and the four ladies
were drowned, their bodies being found
this morning buried under brush and
sand, about 200 feet from the place where
the water struct; the carriage. Mr. War
ren was swept away and his body was
lodged in the branches of a tree, where he
was afterward found terribly bruised but
alive.
The bodies of the four women were re
covered to-day and sent to Denver with
the injured survivor. Miss Holme is a
daughter of the manaeer cf the Denver
Water Company, and the Misses Homer
dauchters of Judge J. W. Homer, also of
Denver. Seventeen persons in cabins and
tents in Bear Creek canyon above town
constituted one party. One of the Proctor
children was rescued by the heroic efforts
of two young men, who braved the flood
when at its highest point to save the child.
She says tbe water came while they were
all in the house and all were swept away.
The Herres family has become extinct,
the father and husband having died a few
months ago.
The Casey family were also in this party.
Tbe Hansen girl was a servant Mrs.
Miller lived here, her husband being en
gaged in mining about and was not at
home at the time. The Longnecker family
were upstairs in their home when the
flood came. Mr. Longuecker saved all but
one member of his family, a little boy
called Jake.
GOLDEN, Colo., July 25.â Three bodies,
all that are known to have been lost in last
night's flood in this city have been re
covered. The dead are :
A. A. Johnson,
Mrs. A. A. Johnson,
Mrs. J. F. Edwards, all of Golden.
Anotherflood came out of the canyon this
afternoon, but no Jives were lost. Seven
teen people came in from Idaho Springs
this afternoon, having left the train at
Beaver Brook and walked in from that
point They report that the trark and
roadbed are about all gone between Golden
and Beaver Brook.
Abc_. "o'clock last night threatening
clouds came over the hill from tliÂ« direc
tion of Morrison. It bad been cloudy and
foggy all day and the clouds gathered to
ward evening in ominous-looking masses.
Rain fell in torrents from the atart, fol
lowed by hail, then a wall of water from
twenty-five to thirty feet in height came
rushing down Clear Creek, carrying every
thing before it
The flood lasted about half an hour and
was followed by a heavy rain, which con
tinued until about 10 o'clock. At that
hour a body of water, ereater in volume
than the first flood, came down Tucker
Gulch, emptying into Clear Creek. It
was this second flood that carried away
the house of Johnson and his wife, and
which drowned Mrs. Edwards.
The body of Mrs. J. F. Edwards was
found face downward in Tucker Gulch.
She leaves a husband and two children.
She went out to look for her cattle
last night and was not heard from after
that.
The body of Mrs. Johnson was found 200
feet from the site of her house among
some trees. Her husband's body was
found in a tree near Coos brewery. They
had been caught while in their little cot
tage home.
The scene around tbe bed of the creek
is terrible. Water came down Ford street
from Tucker Gulch carrying many houses
with it. On Washington avenue and
other parallel streets the scene is the
same. Two bridges have been washed
out, and three piers of the Denver, Lake
wood and Golden bridge were knocked
out by the iron work of the Ford-street
bridge. Tbe loss is estimated to be be
tween $40,000 and $50,000.
BUILDINGS SUBMERGED.
Much Damage Done by the Storms in
the Mast.
PITTSBURG, Pa., July 25.â Reports re
ceived to-night from towns on tbe Mo
nongahela and Youghiogheny rivers are
more reassuring, but serious damage is
reported in many places.
At McKeesport the entire lower part of
the city is submerged, and many houses
have been deserted. The large iron works
of the Dewees Wood Company suffered
ereat damage. A part of the National

tbe heavy rains which have faiJen in this
section during the past three days. All

CAJUNCEY DEPEW RETURNS.
How the Silver Movement in This Coun
. try Has Staggered Europe. \
NEW YORK, N. ; V., July 25.-Hou.
Dbauncey M. Depew arrived from Europe
yesterday. He [ has been called home* by
the alarming illness; of Mr. Yanderbilt.
He has nothing but the pleasantest words
for the English people's hospitality. He
said the English were unanimous for arbi
tration instead of possible war, so far as
America is concerned. .
Mr. Depew said the action of the Chicago
convention profoundly interested the Eng
lish, and indeed all Europe. It had given
international bimetallism a body blow in
Europe from which it will require years to
recover. It. has killed the bimetallist
party in Great Britain and paralyzed it in
Germany.

Amnesty for Irish Political Prisoners.
CHICAGO, 111., July 25.â The move
ment which originated in this country
some time back, looking to the securing
of an amnesty for the Irish political pris
oners now in jails in Ireland and
England, but which has been dormant of
late, is expected to receive a new impetus
from the great demonstration of Irish-
Americans and native Americans to be
held at Battery D to-night.

FESE SILVER IS DISCUSSED.
Viewed With Alarm and Despair by
Leading WorkiEgmenâMiscel
laneous Gossip.
LONDON, Enq., July 25.â 1f to-morrow
is a fine day London will present a spec
tacle which may easily mislead some hun
dreds of foreigners who witness it. as well
as many millions of others who read about
it, as preliminary to the sessions of
the International Labor Congress
which is to be held here during the
coming week. A big demonstra
tion Is to be made in Hyde Park, and clear
skies will bring out hundreds of thousands
of people. So far as the programme and
the terms of the resolutions proposed go,
the gathering will reveal socialism and
trades unionism much more closely identi
fied than they have ever been before in
Hyde Park. It is true that socialists, so
called, have of late controlled most English
trades union congresses, but it is a long
step from that to bringing Continental agi
tators like Bebbel, Guesde and Adler upon
a common platform, under the English
sky with moderate collectivists like Pick
ard, M. P., and Sidney Webb.
That such an apparent fusion should be
misunderstood in Germany and France is
inevitable. That does not matter much,
but it would be a misfortune if Americans
should get a wrong impression of what it
means. Lord Salisbury's famous remark,
"We arc all socialists nowadays," really
puts the right label on the whole affair.
Up to a certain point most Englishmen
feel that individualism has been carried
too far, and they listen tolerantly to the
projects for pooling public issues and let
ting the state help in extracting a general
average for those who are too weak to get
it for themselves; but there they stop
short and the chance* of setting them to
stir further in that direction are as hope
less as are those of opening up communi
cation with Mars.
They will go to Hyde Park, perhaps,
even in a rain, to hear what the collectiv
ist plans and ideals are, but they have no
earthly intention of voting for them now
or hereafter. What is said from the plat
forms may slightly color future legisla
tion by one or the other of the old parties,
between which the English voter alter
nates, but it will create no impulse what
ever toward the formation of a third
party. There are not Â«o many actual so
ciaiistt in London to-day aa there were in
1848.
Three Americans are announced among
the speakers â the Messrs. Qeard had Ma
guire and a Mrs. Stetbon, described as "Of
the California socialists 1 ." They may tell
their hearers that Chicago and St. Louis
represent triumphs for the cause, but it
will fall on aeaf earn.
Without exception the labor leaders
here regard the reported capture of the
American trades unions by Bryan with
despair and disgust. They say that the
wage-earning class is t he one of all others
which would be smashed first by sucn an
upheaval as free silver would provoke, and
that it would be the last class to recover
from the catastrophe. The English so
cialist leader, Fyndman, takes the same
view. He denounces the silver delusion
as childish, and he declares that the im
pulse behind it is one of naked repudiation
of debts. From no class of either working
people or social reformers here does the
silver Populist movement, aa it has de
lined itself, get respect or sympathy.
Lord Farrer to-day in a review of the
whole currency question lays: "There
may be some excuse for the Ignorant
Western farmer, who has been told
wild lies about hoarded gold some
where, but there Is none whatever
for English bimetallists who per
sisted in their assinine folly in the face of
their knowledge that the banks of Europe
are overflowing with a plethora of gold,
which no currency demands can absorb."
He asserts that "neither they nor Gen
eral Walker dared on July 13 to repeat
any of their discredited assertions about
the scarcity of gold, which used to be the
burden of their talk, and they feared to
mention the vital question of a fixed ratio
at all."
This veteran economist, who was nervous
at first, is now full of faith that in a square
fight between honest and dishonest money
in America rigut will surely win.
Macedonia has not been kept quiet after
all. Two invasions have taken placeâ one
by a band of 1000 fighters, marching south
ward from the Bulgarian frontier, who are
said to have been surrounded and cut to
pieces in a pass of the Periui Mountains,
and the other by 230 Greeks who went
northward in Coado, landed near Katar
ina and have entirely destroyed the first
Turkish force of eighty men which they
met. Whether or not these movements,
separated by a hundred miles or so, belong
to one plan is not known, but they strong
ly suggest that the pressure from outside,
which heretofore forbade violence in
Macedonia, has been withdrawn.
Berlin hears that Prince Lobanofl's posi
tion fias been shaken, which would be
very important if true. His pro-Turkish
policy is known to have been stoutly
opposed by the Czar's mother, who has
developed into a vehement politician
since her husband died, and whose passion
is to see Germany humbled. This open
ing of the ball in Macedonia looks as if
she has had her way against the Lobanoff-
WilJiam plan of maintaining the Sultan
at all hazards. Another fortnight will
f how if this is the case, and if it is there
will be an extraordinary scurrying about
among the Chancellors for new alliances
and guarantees against the dangers of
TurKey's collapse.

even their p arty friends in London. The
English Tories blame them, justly, for
having ruined Ireland by their greed and
stupidity, and have long resented in pri
vate their disposition to ruin the Tory
party, too. unless it humb'y did their bid
ding; hence, when Mr. Balfour, his pa
tience exhausted in efforts to placate them,
finally turned on them in the person of
Mr. Curzon, and in the name of the Gov
ernment denounced their unpatriotic
meanness, their venom and their disloy
alty, it sent a magnetic thrill through bis
whole party. He is quite restored to au
thority again by that one happy outburst
of manly wrath.
Until yesterday it was taken for granted
that, even if the Commons passed this
bill, the Lords would throw it out or load
it with impossible amendments, but now
it is said that Lord Salisbury will back his
nephew stoutly, and threaten the Lord 9,
if necessary, with a Cabinet crisis unless
they abandon their Irish colleagues and
vote straight. At this rate the Tory party
will be talking of home rule as not so bad
a thing, after all, in another year or two.
AH through the spring and early sum
mer everybody looked forward to the
Jameson trial as the crowning sensation
of the season, but as a matter of fact it
turned out to be a stupid bore, and during
the latter part of the week people did not
care enough about it even to fill the tiny
courtroom in which it was held. Why the
original idea of the defense to raise the
single technical point of jurisdiction, and
if that failed, to plead guilty, was not pur
sued has not been disclosed, but the alter
ation can have benefited nobody except
the lawyers. The jury is absolutely cer
tain to convict, and the only remaining
interest in the affair is a languid curiosity
about the sentence. Incidentally the trial
has bad a striking effect on Lord Russell's
popular reputation. He cut sharply
through the whole fabric of objections to
the wording of the indictment by the re
mark that the precedents on which they
weie base I dated from the time when it
was the habit of the courts to sacrifice jus
tice to the science ol artificial statement,
and when Sir Edward Clarke piled up a
fresh mass of verbiage at another point
iv the road Lord Russell kicked it aside
with the query, "Do you contend, then,
that common-sense has nothing to do
with your case."
His whole management of the trial,
which was alert, powerful and vigorously
hostile to nonsense, has been a revelation
to the bar aiid has created a profound im
pression on the public. It is foreseen that
he is going to ran* among the very great
est Judges of English history, and it is
hoped that he will soon acquire personal
weight enough to establish a new stand
ard of courage and independence on the
English bench at large, where, heaven
knows, it is badly enough needed. Dra
matically it is a great pity that Americans
can not see him in wig and gown during
his coming visit to the United States. Not
only is he vastly more effective to look at
when thus arrayed, but oddly enough, it
is only then that he speaks at bis bes:.
Premier Reid of New Bouth Wales, it is
felt, has driven the last needed nail into
the coffin of Chamberlain's scheme for an
"Imperial Zollverein." Not only does he
declare it impossible from an internal
point of view, but he says that it would
destroy England by uniting the rest of the
world in a hostile, combination, armed
with a new and substantial motive for re
venge. This is franker talk than most
colonial politicians have ventured, bat it

only puts bluntly what seems to be felt in
all parts of the empire. Although Cbam
beriain seems to be holding his own in
Parliament, it is evident that this collapse
of his pet project has heavily discredited
bis reputation outside.
Largely through the effortÃ of Mr. Lath
rope, our Consul at Bristol, the citizens of
that city are making fine progress with
their scheme for celebrating next June the
four hundredth anniversary of the sailing
of the Cabots. It is understood that the
Prince of Wales will consent to lay the
cornerstone of a grand memorial there the
same day and hour the Duke of York lays
one of like nature in Canada, and there is
certainly no other European town where
visiting Americans would get a heartier
or more intelligent welcome than in
Bristol.
A Liverpool correspondent comments
to-day on the fact that the English papers
have not given their readers a single hint
of the fact that there has been what be
calls a grave collapse of the cycle boom in
America. He asserts that during the past
month |15,000 worth of American ma
chines have been entered at Liverpool as
the result of the forced sales in America.
The prices for which they have been sell
ing, he adds, have already badly broken
the Liverpool market and will probably
effect England at large. This statement
may precipitate a crash next week here,
where the bringing oat of new cycle com
panies has grown to be a universal mania.
The Manchester Chamber of Commerce
has committed itself to the new idea of
utilizing streetcars, or what are called
here, "tramway lines," during the dead
hours of night for the conveyance of mer
chandise, and it will associate itself with
similar progressive bodies in the north to
press upon Parliament the adoption of
some scheme to make general this night
use of such tracks and plants. There is
I no doubt that the motor-car bill will be
come a law this session and the engineers
of various municipalities are hard at work
over plans to utilize this new machinery
also for "ceneral civic purposes."
The new volume of the "historical" se
ries proves to be of unexpected interest
from an American point of view. Eleven
years ago, when the "Calendar of Dart
mouth" manuscripts were published, it
was supposed that nothing more was ob
tainable from that source, but in 1891,
when the new Earl of Dartmouth came
into the title, he had things cleaned up,
and among some discarded rubbish were
found several packets of old love letters
largely relating to the period of the Amer
ican Revolution and containing informa
tion most of which was hitherto unknown.
These letters begin with tha enforcem nt
of the stamp act and continue through
1775 neariv to the close of the war. Lord
Dartmouth was the nobleman whose coat
of arms is reproduced in our Stars and
Stripes through marriage with the Wash
inetons of Leicester â a fact which has
given rise to endless heraldic and genea
logical controversies.

BERLIN, Germany, July 25.â 1t is an
nounced that the Emperor, after passing
the first week of August with the Empress
and their children at the Schlossd at Wil
belmshoe, will come to Berlin to meet
and confer with Prince Hohenlohe, the
Imperial Chancellor, and General Bronsart
yon Schellendorf, Minister of War. It is
now known positively mat his Majesty
will not eoto Cowes. as was expected he
would do. The programme Is fixed for
his appearance at various public func
tions during the time intervening betweeu
now and the middle of September, when,
it is stated privately, he will pay a visit to
Queen Victoria at Balmorai, going direct
from Kiel to Aberdeen on board the im
perial yacht Hohenzollern.
The relations of the Emperor with
Prince Hohenlohe and General Bronsart
yon Schellendorf occupy the first position
in the attention of the high officials of the
Government,
The retirement of Prince Hohenlohe
from office in the face of a grave European
crisis is retarded by every one as being
extremely improbable, apart from the fact
that the Emperor has intru sted the Chan
cellor with the task of conducting negotia
tions of a most. serious character with
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria and
Count Goluchowski, the Austrian Minister
of foreign Affairs, and the additioaal fact
that Prince Lobanoff - Rostovsky, the
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, is still
aiming at the maintenance of the integrity
of the Turkish empire. Still it is un
doubtedly true that General Bronsart yon
Schellendorf has offered his resignation to
the Emperor, and it is equally certain that
Prince Hohenlohe has informed the
Kaiser of his desire to retire from office if
General Schellendorf's demands tor reform
in the procedure of military tribunals are
not granted. It is understood that the
Emperor will request General Schellendorf
to retain, office until the close of the

autumn military maneuvers, when a defi
nite decision in regard to the reforms pro
posed by the Minister of War will be
reached.
In high military circles it is the general
belief that this means the eventual defeat
of the cabal in the Military Cabinet of the
Emperor beaded by General yon Hahneke,
head of thai body, and the Emperor's re
tention of the present ministry without
change.
ThÂ« newest feature ofinternal politics is
the attempt of the former court chaplain,
Dr. Stoecker, and his followers to found a
pa rty to be called Religions Socialists, as
distinct from the Christian Socialists.
Orthodox Christians with anti-Semitic
views and free from revolutionary bias
will, according to a manifesto published
in the Kreuz Zeitung, be the nucleus of
the party, the first principle of which will
be conservation of religious faith, through
which alone the renovation of society ia
possible. Dr. Stoecker, by thus separat
ing himself and his followers from the
unorthodox Christian Socialists, has led
Pastora Neulann and Gohre to obtain a
rapprochement with the Conservative
party.
For some time past the old army order
which prohibits non-commissioned officers
and privates from talcing any part what
ever in socialist gatherings has been rather
loosely enforced, and it bad become very
common to see soldiers of these grades in
attendance at the festive meetings of
socialists under the red flag. Several sol
diers were recently arrested for this
offense, and this hasjnnally awakened the
War Ministry, which has produced a
special edict declaring that non-commis
sioned officers and privates must not be
seen at socialist meetings, nor will they bo
allowed to attend festivities of any kind
without first obtaining special permission.
The order does not stop here, but declares
that soldiers are liable to be severely pun
ished for carrying socialist newipapers or
other literature into their barrack?.
Herr yon Bennigsen, son of Dr. yon
Bennigsen, the National Liberal leader in
the Reichstag, was severely wounded this
week in a duel with Herr Escbke, a
Colonial Judge. The duel grew out of the
fact that Bennigsen carried out his in
structions by inspecting some territory
which was under EÂ«chke's jurisdiction.
An official inquiry into Eschke's conduct
has been ordered by the authorities.

HER DISMAL VOYAGE.
The Ship William Tell Arrived Yes-
terday After a Hard Struggle
Around Cape Horn.
The ship William Tell arrived from
Swansea last evening, having sailed from
that port February 18. Off the Falkland
Islands, April 20, she met a fierce souther
which carried away her foresail, fore
topmast staysail and a portion of the
mainsail blown out of the furling gaskets.
Next day the ship was struct by a gigantic
wave which threw her 011 her beamends,
shifting the cargo fore and aft.
The vessel Jay in this perilous position
for four days, while the crew was below
reshifting the cargo. . Over seventy feet of
the port bulwarks were stove in and the
stanchions were more or less broken.
The deckhouses were smashed, the gig
and cutter stove and the lifeboat platform
washed away.
From this point to 50 degrees of south
latitude in the Pacific was a continuance
of hard westerly pales.
On the night of May 11, while a furious
storm from the west-southwest was rag
ing, the darkness was suddenly dispelled
by the most brilliant globeÃ of St. Elmo's
fire at each yardarm and mastheads. Sud
denly a glaring thunderbolt darted
through the maintopsail, making a round
hole about 10 inches in diameter.
This phenomenon was followed by an
increase in the sale, which continued till
t lie equator was crossed, June 22. The
ship had much sickness aboard during the
last three months, having as many as six
men down at the s.ime time, from injuries
and exposure in the bad weather. One
man of the crew was attended in the cabin
for three week". Th** steward was ill with
pnuemonia for several months, and often
during that time was not expected to live.
Fell From a Track.
Adeline Gigderskrantz, a little girl living
with her parents at 922 Battery street, fell off
a truck yesterday near her home and suffered
n fracture of her left leg. The dray was one
belonging to Case Strauss, and was passing
along the street when 6everal children
mounted it. In sport one of them pushed
Adeline, and she fell off with the result stated.
She was taken to the Receiving Hospital, and
the fracture reduced, after which she was
taken to her home.

A. R. McFarlane, who was tnken to the Re

fectly cured and in a normal state of health.
It seems that Mr. McFarlane had been suffer

over certain losses of jewelry, to such an ex
tent that he fainted away. His uncomcious
condition lasted thirty hours, when he wais re
stored to health. His friends are congratu

AMY HEAD'S STORY
GAINS STRENGTH,
Albert Stetson Probably
Fired the Fatal
Shot.
NO PROOF OF SUICIDE.
Evidence That the Dead Man
Did. Not Know His Revolver
Was Loaded.
THE FUNERAL WILL BE TO-DAY
Frederick Webster Arrives From the
EastâMiss Head Tells Her Story
to the Police.
It was decided yesterday that the funeral
of the late Albert Stetson will take place
from the Stetson residence, 1801 Van Ness
avenue, at 1 o'clock to-day, and the inter
ment will be at Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
Rev. Dr. Robert Mackenzie will conduct
the services. The Coroner's inquest will
take place at 9 a. m. to-morrow.
Miss Amy Head, sole witness of the
tragedy, admits, after thinking the matter
over, that Stetson may have believed the
revolver was empty when he palled the
trigger that ended his life.
Miss Head, much distressed over the
notoriety incident to the tragedy, re-:
turned from Oakland yesterday, refusing,
however, to talk further on the matter for
publication. She paid the story of the
affair as printed in. yesterday's Call was
correct and she had 110 further statements
to make.
Autopsy Surgeon Barrett investigated
the case further yesterday, and said: "Dr.
Morse was correct in his diagnosis pro
nouncing cirrhosis of the liver one of
Stetson's ailments. I found some evidences
of cirrhosis, also evidences of dilatation of
the heart. Cirrhosis would probably have
produced mental depression. I have con
cluded, after considerable study and in
vestigation, that the absence of powder
marks does not show whether the shot was
fired from a distance or close at hand, be
cause the powder was evidently smokeless.
I shall make further investigations to-mor
row by firing at various distances at human
hair and tissue-paper."
The story that Miss Head said she took
the cartridges from Stetson's revolver at
the Orpheum, published in several news
papers, was denied by her yesterday ; also
the statement attributed to her that she
had not seen any reporter. She was rnter
viewed by The Call at 2 :30 p. m. Friday,
after which she went to Oakland and re
mained in seclusion from the police until
yesterday. She did not yesterday change
a single statement of her original story as
printed in The Call.
Detective R. J. Whittaker spent the en
tire day yesterday in running down clews
in the Stetson tragedy. He found Miss
Head and obtained her official statement
of the events that occurred in Fred Web
ster's rooms, 236 Post street. Her state
ment corroborates every point covered in
her prior account given to The Call yes
terday.
The only new feature in the story told
by Miss Head is that she makes it em
phatic that she and Mr. Stetson were
in the Post-street rooms not to exceed
five or ten minutes and that the shooting
occurred about 1 o'clock, fully two hours
earlier than at first reported. The follow
ing is a verbatim copy of Miss Head's re
port made to Detective Whittaker and
submitted to Captain Lees last night:
On Thursday evening, in company with my
lady friend, I attended the Orpheum, occupy
ing n box on the right-hand side of the house.
While seated there my friend, Mrs. Summer
field, called my attention to Mr. stetson and
Charley Hug, who were seated in the body of
the audience. We saw and bowed to the gen
tlemen, and shortly thereafter Mr. Stetson
came over and asked us if we wanted a little
bite after the show. Later on Mr. Stetson came
over to the box where we were seated. I said,
â¢'Mi. Stetson, how are you?" He said, "I am
feeling bad." I said, "What's the matter with
you? You are looking bad," and he replied
that he had been drinking hard for the past
week â drinking absinthe.
While talking to us he had his left arm on the
box railing ann his right hand on his hip, show
ing hit pistol. Seeing that he was very nervous
and drinking hard I said, "Mr. Stetson, give
me that j.lEtol," and he said, "No, 1 wHI not
give it to you; you can't have it." I then
reached over, however, and took the pinol out
of his pants hip pocket, after which he asked
us if we would take a little lunch after the
theater. We consented, and ho told ua to
meet him at the Columbia Cafe after the show.
This we did and Mr. Hug ana Mr. Stetson and
Mr. Samuels met us there, the latter gentle
man remaining but a short time. During our
lunch Mr. Steieon ordered several drinks, each
time taking absinthe.
Mrs. Summerfield told him that that drink
sets Frenchmen crazy and she told him it
would have the same effect on him if he drank
it. Then he wanted to buy a bottle of wine, but
we declined to change our drinks. During our
stay in the cafe I gave Al his pistol, saying to
him, "What do you want to carry that for?"
He did not reply, but took the pistol, which
was a five-shooter, ana removed four cart
ridges. I said, "Mr. Stetson, here are only
four," and he said, "That's all right," and put
the pistol in his coat pocket, after which we
left the cafe.
Mr. Hug accompanied Mrs. Bummerfleld and
Mr. Stetson went with me. The former couple
took the Geary-street car, corner Genry and
Powell, going west. Mr. Stetson and I started
down Geary street. I told him I was going to
Mr. Webster's rooms to get my dog and then I
would ring for a coupe and he could leave me
at my home and he then could go home. He
said he was not going home, as bis lolks were
all away, and I told him that was just the rea
son why be should go home. We took the
elevator in the building at 235 Post street and
went to Mr. Webster's apartments. He, Mr.
Stetson, then laid his coat and hat on the
table.
I then went into an adjoining room and he
came back and stood in the bedroom, facing
the Fost-etreet side. I said :
"Mr. Stetson, this is not going home," and
he raised his hand to his head, nt the same
time saying, "This is the way I urn goingiioine,
Amy," and fired the shot which killed him.
He fell fate down, and the pistol dropped on
the floor. I ran down to Mr. Quay's room, in
the same building, got him out of bed and told
him that Al Stetson had shot himself. He
came upstairs with me, and, looking into the
roorn^ saw Mr. Stetson lying there. Hesaid:
â¢'This is no place for me. You hHd better send
for some of nis personal iriendj."
I then took a hack at the corner ot Post and
Grant avenue and rode out to Mr. Hug's house
and told him what hail happened. He came
down to the rooms with me, and on our ar
rival Al was still alivr, ami Mr. Hug went
down stairs and called Dr. Farrell. The doctor
telephoned for Dr. Tyrrell and Mr. Hug tele
phoned for Dr. 2>lcrse, Mr. Stetson's family
phytician. Before they nrrived I went down
stairs and laid down on the lounge in Dr. Far*
rell's room, and later on Dr. Farrell came down
and told me that Al was deau and thai the un
dertaker was removing his remains to an un
dertaking parlor.
Mr. Stetson's condition was very bad. He ap
peared very nervous and told me he had had
some trouble with h is railroad; that Mr. Bul
lock had sold out for $35,000. This, he said,
had started him drinking, and he had been
drinking absinthe for a week. We arrived at
Mr. Webster's rooms at 12:30 o'clock, and Al
shot himself only a few minutes later.
"I have seen enough people," said De
tective Whittaker last night, "to convince
me that Miss Head told the entire truth
about most of the main features of her
account. I say most of the main features,
because no one was there during the hof>t
ing but herself. Mrs. Summerfield cor
roborates Miss Head's story, and says,
'Let no one suppress facts to shield me.
Tell it all freely. I was at the Orpheum
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
and at the Columbia Cafe, and I went
home, as stated, escorted by Mr. Hug.'
"1 have every reason to believe that
Stetson never crossed the threshold of
Webster's rooms before the time he killed
himself there, and that there was nothing
improper in his conduct with the young
lady at any time. They were not in the
room to exceed five minntes. Her story
is straightforward, probaole and altogether
in keeping with tbe circumstances.
"It is probable that Stetson had many
drinks when he was oat in the coupe
alone, and then he was irresponsible when
he pulled the trigger, though there was
many t nines to show that he did not think
the revolver was loaded when he pulled
tbe trigger."
Coroner Hawkins yesterday said that he
did not see the revolver and other prop
erty of the deceased as they lay in the
room of death.
"The revolver was handed to me," he
said, "and it struck me as a strange thing
thai there were no papers, letters, books
or other data in the dead man's pockets.
Of course, I know of no one who couid
have removed the things, but most men
of his standing carry more papers than I
found in his pockets.
The more closely the facts *in the case
are studied by the police the more firmly
are they convinced that the fatal shot was
fired by Stetson, either suicidally or under
the belief that the revolver was not loaded.
Miss Head shuns notoriety. She re
fuses to allow artists to sketch her or to
give her pictures to any one.
"Of course the newspapers will sketch
me at the inquest," she said last night,
"but I don't care so much for what I can
not help; but they won't get my picture
with my consent."
Fred Webster arrived from the East on
tbe 8:45 train last night and evaded all re
porters. A rumor gained circulation that
he drove directly to the Baldwin Hotel
and went in the Arcade entrance. The
manager of the hotel positively denied
this rumor at midnight. Soon thereafter
Captain Lees came down in tbe elevator.
To a Call reporter he said :
"Webster is in town. He arrived to-

Excellent Musical and Athletic En
tertainment to Ail in Build
ing a Gymnasium.
The members of the St. George Club
gave a musical and athletic entertainment
in theii rooms at 317 Mason street, last
evening, the proceeds of which will go
toward the erection of the gymnasium
planned by the directors.
The programme was carefully arranged
to avoid monotony, wrestling and fistic
bouts and fencing being interspersed with
vocal and instrumental music From
first to last number the large audience
was kept in thorough good humor.
The musical selections were a concert
solo by George W. Loyde; song, "Gal
lants of England," by J. F. Fleming; song,
"Death of isapoleon," by Alfred Wilkie;
vocal duet by J. F. -Fleming and Alfred
Wilkie.
The first athletic event was a wrestling
match between Joe Acton and Otto
Eicholtz. Joe managed to win both falls
by climbing upon Eicholtz's shoulders and
sitting down. A ?Â»cond wrestling-match
between W. Bartlett and C. Kreling re
sulted in each man scoring one fall.
Several lively boxing bouts were exe
cuted by Jack Zeimar and George Purcell,
F. Raphael and Al Lawton and Charley
Carroll, son of the veteran Jimmy, and
Australian Arthur Walker.
Captain J. Martin, late of the Olympic
Club, and L. P. Ward, gave an exhibition
of fencing. Captain Martin managed to
score a few mpre points than his adversary
and ended by breaking Ward's foil.
Jimmy Carroll acted as master of cere
monies and kept his hearers delighted
with his funny quips and jokes.
During the interitn between one of the
fistic contests, a boxer leaned back in his
chair and breathed heavily as if nearly
exhausted. Jimmy surveyed him quietly
for a moment, and Jhen turning 10 the
crowd grimly remarked, "There have been
others.

Shore, but No Assistance
Could Be Given.
HEARTRENDING CRIES FOR AID
After Rounding the Horn the Vessel
Was Driven B ck and Went
on the Rocks.
All doubt as to the fate of the American
ship City of Philadelphia has been set at
rest. The vessel was wrecked near Port
Stanley and the|chances are that all hands
were drowned. Yesterday Williams, Di
mond A Co. received the following dis
patch from Dearborn & Co. of New York:
â¢I n formation from Port Stanley confirms
the loss of the City of Philadelphia. >:
The vessel was bound from New York
for San Francisco with a general cargo and
at one time 90 per cent reinsurance was
paid on her. When the British ship
Brenda arrived a few days ago Captain
Tullock reported baring spoken the City
of Philadelphia on May 1 in latitude 57
south, longitude 68 west. At that time she
was under six lower topsails and making
heavy weather of it. The Philadelphia
must have been driven back dnring the
storm that came up and finally went on
Billy Rock near Port Stanley.
A private letter from Port Stanley,
dated May 17, reads as follows:
Four days previously a three-masted ship
was seen under topsaiU making for Port Wil
liam entrance to Port Stanley, and flying the
jack for a pilot.
The piloi-boat Victoria went out and tried to
get near the ship, but owing to a heavy sea did
not even get near enough to signal her. Dark
ness came on and the Victoria returned to port,
the ship standing offshore.
Next evening a mun rode in from the light
bouse at Cape Pembroke with news that the
ship was on Billy Rock. We hastened to the
scene, but everybody on board had been
washed overboard and drowned. Had a pow
erful tug been available all hands could nave
been saved.
willing hands were within a short distance
of the doomed shipâ so near, in fact, that the
crew could bi seen clinging to the mizzen rig
ging. They were heard calling, "Come and
save us." but owing to the heavy sea and lack
of facilities nothing could be done.
George C. Gordon, British ship St. Enoch; W.
Tooar, British ship Pasa of Balmaka: P. Mc-
Plierson, bark Bankville; David Reese, bark
Thetis; Peter Noble, englneer.Falkland Islands.
The United States Consul at Falkland
Islands also wrote, stating that a full
rigged ship had been driven ashore on
Billy Rock, and that all hands had been
lost. The letters were mailed on board
the mail steamer for Montevideo, and
irom that point came to San Francisco.
The captain reported having passed
through a large quantity of coal oil and
lumber, and as the City of Philadelphia
was laden with coal oil and general mer
chandise, there can be no doubt but what
she was the unfortunate ship that went on
Billy Rock.
The City ol Philadelphia was an old
timer, and was on her first voyaKe to San
Francisco. She was built at Bath , Me., in
1875, and was 1384.45 tons net burden. Her
length was 202 feet 3 inches, breadth 40
feet 2 inches and depth 24 feet 3 inches.
She was in command of Captain John
son, who was well known in this port as
an able and efficient master.
The American ship Santa Clara from
New York for San Francisco, is also over
due, she being now out 162 days. Heavy
reinsurance has been paid on her. The
British ship Wilhelm Tell, on which 40
per cent reinsurance was paid, reached
port last night, however, so there may be
a chance for the Santa Clara. The Wil
helm Tell was 158 days making the run
from Swansea.
The ferry steamer Bay City is to be laid
up for inspect-on and a thorough over
hauling. -Her place on the narrow-guage
route will be taken by the El Capitan. The
latter has had new boilers put in and has
been thoroughly renovated. She is now
one of the smartest boats belonging to
the Southern Pacific.
The ticket agÂ«nts at the Tiburon ferry
will be kept buxy to-day. There will be
the usual excursions to El Campo, the
favorite picnic-grounds, and the '49ers will
hold their third annual outing at Schuetzen
Park. There will be valuable gate prizes
given away, a tus-of-war and music by the
Lettwr-carriers' band.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Orizaba arrived from Mexican ports yester
day with twenty-three cabin and eleven
steerage passengers. It was a fair-weather
passage all the way and nothing of interest
occurred.
Captain W. Rugg, tLe well-known
master of sailing vessels and more lately
of the steam schooner Newsboy, had a
stroke of good luck last Friday. A lottery
peddler pestered him to buy a ticket, but,
aÂ« the skipper was down to a dime, he at
first refused. Finally he borrowed a
quarter from a friend and bought a
coupon. Two hours later he picked up a
paper and found to his astonishment that
he bad won $67 50. Hugg is more than
pleased over his good fortune.
The steamer Sunol, which got in last
night, reports that the schooner Halcyon
was close in suore near Point Reyes when
last seen. The captain of the Sunol of
fered assislance, but the proffer was de
clined. The Halcyon left here last Friday
and is becalmed within half a mile of the
point. As soon as a wind springs up she
will have no difficulty in getting off shore.
Excursion to the Oregon.
The commanding officer of the line-of
battle-sbip states that no large body of
visitors be allowed on board to-day.
The Oregon is not ready, as there is a
large quantity of stores, including tor
pedoes, about the decks awaiting a chance
to get stowed away. It is hoped that by
Sunday next the battle-ship will be ready
to receive all and sundry and on that oc
casion everybody will be shown over the
fastest vessel of her class in Uncle Sam's
navy. .

IN THE EVENING SCHOOLS
The Chamber of Commerce Wants
a Navigation Class
Established.
A Letter Addressed to the Local Board
of Education on This
Subject.
The Chamber of Commerce has for
some time been advocating the establish
ing of an evening class in navigation in
connection with the public evening schools
of this City and has formulated a plan by
which the scheme may be made feasible.
In order to interest the School Depart
ment in the matter Hugh Craig, president
' of the chamber, addressed the following
i letter to the Board of Education on Fri
day:
The Chamber of Commerce of California re
spectfully calls your attention to the desirabil
ity of establishing an evening school of navi
gation as an adjunct to the public school
system of our City. The success that has
attended the establishment of the United
States Naval School at this port indicates the
interest of young men in a sea career.
San Francisco must depend upon her posi
tion as a great seaport for her permanent
prosperity, and her youth should be given the
opportunity to acquire the science 01 naviga
tion as an encouragement to follow the Na
tional ensign afloat, ooth in the naval and
merchant marine.
We are pleased to note that the California
Naval Reserve, established through the agency
of this chamber, is now the popular branch of
the armed forces of our Stateâ a further proof
of public interest in maritime affairs. Conse
quently, we respectfully urge upon your hon
orable board the establishment of a class in
navigation at as early a date as possible.
Hugh Craig, President.
The matter will be considered at the
next meeting of the board.
Beheaded by the Spaniards.
Â£. N. Smith, connected with the United
States Life-saving Department in this City, re
ceived information yesterday that his step
brother, George B. Rea., had been beheaded by
the Spaniards in Cuba. Of the details of the
crime Mr. Smith knows nothing, but he is sat
isfied that Rea was butchered merely to gratify
Spanish malice. He does not think that the
youne man had joined the Cubans, because
his business would not admit it. Young Rea
went to Mamanzas, Cuba, from New York,
about five years ago, to tnlte charge of the city
electric plant. He was 28 years old, and is de
scribed by Mr. Smith aa a quiet, inoffensive
fellow.

the course of s-tudy. All of the depart
ments are now thoroughly organized and
equipped and the faculty has been
strengthened by the appointment of Wil
liam H. Hollis, B. S., a specially trained
chemist and food analyst from the Univer
sity of California.
A leading feature of the school is its ma
chine shop, under the able supervision of
Matthew Arnold, formerly uf the Union
Iron Works, it is equipped with lathes,
a Pond planer, a \Vo;cester cinll-grinder,
an Aurora drill press a Stow center-erind
er, diamond wet and dry grinder, vised,
bench tools, lockers, benches, lathe
chucks, shafting, belting, etc. The esti
mated cost of the shop and its equipments
is $7000. It is the most complete of any
thing of its class on the Pacific (/'oast.
Wi'ile the machine-shops and the foun
dry are leading attractions for the boys,
the girls are equally interested in tbe
cookery department. J his is practically
equipped wi h cupboards, benches, pas
ranges, steam pipe facilities, etc. Its
chief feature, though, is an Aladdin oven,
into which food for a breakfast can be put
tbe night before and taken out and eaten
tbe next morning. The oven consists of a
tin box, and the heat in supplied by a
lamp. It is one of the latest and most
successful of modern cuiinary inventions.
The furnace-house has lately been fin
ished, and the students of the scboo l are
now turning out very creditable bronze
castings.
The class of beginners will be admitted
next Wednesday, and will be limited to
seventy-five boys and fifty girls. Only
thirty-eisrht boys will be admitted from
this City, the remaining thirty-seven
places being reserved for country boys.
During the past year twenty-four counties
of the Beats were represented in the enroll
ment.
Graduates of manual training schools
are admitted directly to the apprentice
course, but all other students are required,
before entering, to complete a preliminary
course of two years or less, depending
upon their previous training.

Some one said to us the
other day: "I see you are |
trying to popularize tea.
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves. It is noth-
ing but poison, and it
wrecks the stomach and
upsets the nerves."
lls that so? Who are
the greatest tea-drinkers
in the world? The Chi-
nese and the Japanese.
And can you think of any
nation more even-spirited,
more un ? nervous than
they? ;..:/
But," said our friend,
"they, drink different kind
of tea."
Yes, that is exactly wh.at
we are saying. They drink
a different kind of tea; ;
pure tea, fresh tea, fine
tea â like Schilling's Best
â and they don't boil it. -

HASLIP SEEN IN
FRESNO COUNTY.
Madera's Sheriff Is Close
Upon the Trail of the
Outlaw.
HIDING IN THE HILLS.
Farmers Living Near Pollasky
Dwell in Fear of the
Murderer.
DETERMINED TO CAPTURE HIM
| The Fugitive Believed to BÂ« Travel
ing Toward the Sierra
Fastnesses.
FRESNO, Cal., July 25.â Sheriff Sam
TVestfall of Madera is in the foothills of
this county, above Pollasky, bunting for
"Jim" Haslip, the Indian wanted for the
murder of an Italian at Raymond over
two years ago. Since be committed the
murder Haslip has eluded the officers,
although several determined attempts
have been made to capture him. Only a
few weeks ago Hi Rapelje and two Sanger
constables tried their hand at capturing
wily "Jim," but he gave them tbe slip.
HasKp was seen a few days ago in tbe
hills near Pollaaky. Sheriff Westfall left
Madera immediately and it is reported to
day that he is hot on the fugitive's trail.
Men arriving from Pollasfcy to-day stated
that the people in the country between
Pollasky and the Big Sandy region were
decidedly uneasy because of the assassin's
presence. They feel that the Indian
would not hesitate to commit another
murder if he were to feel pangs of hunger
or deem himself in danger of capture.
It is believed that Haslip will endeavor
to steal a horse and seek the remote fast
nesses of the Sierra, but Westfall will en
deavor to stop him before he reaches the
divide. _
BLOCKING THE VALLEY ROAD.
Damages Demanded by Fifteen Land-
Owners of Fresno.
FREBNO, Cal., July 25.â Right-of-way
Agent C. 8. Young of the Valley road is
holding daily conferences with property
owners along the survey between this city
and Reedley. He is making favorable
progress. This morning Mr. Young and
members of the local committee of ten
held a meeting with two non-consenting,
property-owners on Q street, in this city.
One of them has raised his previous esti
mate of the value of his lots. No agree
ment was arrived at.
Attorney L. L. Cory, representing the
Q-street property-owners who claim dam
ages for the depreciation of their property,
by reason of the Valley road passing their
doors, nad a conference to-day with At
torney H. H. Welsh, representing the
Valley Railroad Company. Mr. Cory's
figures show that the claimants want
$33,500 damages. There are some fifteen
in all, distributed along the line of Q
Ftreet, among whom arÂ«s the following:
Kobert Kennedy, Jacob Vogel, James
Nicholson, L. O. Stephens, Al Hall. Mrs.
Eames, Carroll Ghent and J. C. Shepard.
WAGING WAR ON VAGEANIS.
Jrresno Officers Attempt to Drive Them
From the City.
FRESNO, Cal., July 25.â Constable
Ehaw and deputies are taking steps to rid
the city of numerous rough characters,
who come with the annual influx of la
borers during the fruit season. The Super
visors have allowed laborers to sleep in
the courthouse park, and here undesir
able characters also make their ren
dezvous. When a Valley road grading
contractor came to town last night look
ing for tnirty laborers at |1 80 a day be
could only get two men who would go out
with him. There have been numerous
complaints of beggars insulting women in
the absence of their husbands at residences
of the city.
Constable Shaw took a decisive step to
day. He picked a dozen of the worst
lookine vagrants and locked them up in
jail on charges of vagrancy. The officer
cays he will continue this until they leave
the city.
ENTERTAINED AT PORTLAND.
Projector* of the Japanese Steamship
Line Outline 2 heir Plans.
PORTLAND, Ob., July 25.âRepresenta
tives of the projected Oriental steamship
line, Sochira Asano, president of the com
pany; H. Okawa, director in the Oji Paper
Company near Tokio; Bhunjiro Tomika, a
captain in the service of the steamship
company, and Hiroyuki Kobdyasbi, inter
preter for Mr. Asano, arrived from Ta
coma to-day. The visitors werÂ« driven to
the Portland Hotel, whence, after a ghort
rest, they were taken to luncheon at the
Commercial Club. The following was ob
tained from Mr. Kobayashi, the inter
preter:
"Our company is one with a capital of
$7,000,000. The Japanese Government,
realizing the benefits to be derived from
on extension of its merchant marine, has
offered liberal subsidies to the promoters
of steamship lines between Japan and for
eign ports, the subsidy being graded ac
cording to the tonnage of the vessel, speed
and number of miles covered on the voy
age. To take advantage of the subsidy,
we propose building twelve large steara-
Bhips of not less tu an 5000 gross register
and placing them in the trade between the
Orient, Europe and the United States. The
larger number of our fleet will operate on
the run across the Pacific Ocean, and it is
to select a terminus for the line that our
present trip is being made."
The combination of a subsidized Japa
nese line with the Oregon-Asiatic line now
operating from Portland would make a
company that would virtually control the
Orient trade on this coast.
GUESTS OF EUREKA.
Oregon Business Men Arrive on a Tisit
to the Northern Port.
EUREKA, CaiÂ», July 25.â The steamer
Cleone arrived this evening with 136 ex
cursionists from Crescent City and South
ern Oregon. As many more were left on
the wharf at Crescent City, being unable
to secure accommodations. A reception
committee, on board the steamer Peerless,
met the visitors at the entrance to the bay
with a band of music and escorted them
vp the haroor to Eureka. The wharves
were black with people assembled to wel
come the northern neighbors.
Most of Crescent City's business and
professional men were in the party. They
hope by means of these excursions to
cement a stroncer business union, and as
their interests are similar to Eureka's, to
work more in unison. Among those who
arrived from Crescent City were; Judge ]
Murphy and wife, J. Wenger of the Lake
Earl Milling Company, Fred Frantz,
County Auditor; City Attorney McNa
mara. Supervisor Murray, Banker K. W.
Palm of Metiford.
A ball was given to-night in honor of
tbe guests. The programme for the morn
ing consists of a reception at 9 o'clock in
tbe Vance House parlors, a tire parade
and hose contests. In the afternoon the
visitors will be shown through the public
buildings, after which the Tenth Battalion
baud will pive an open-air concert from
the balcony of the county courthouse.
The party is in charge of E. W. Frost, who
hopes to obtain a permit to hold the
steamer vrml Monday.
LOS ANGELES SENNATION.
Domestic Troubles of the Beats Aired in
a SHvorce Court.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 25.âSpec
tators in Judge Van Dyke's courtroom to
day were treated to sensational divorce
proceedings. C. H. Beal, a well-known
photographer, is the defendant. The
snappy-eyed plaintiff is making the fight
of her life. She has a long string of wit
nesses to prove her charges of cruelty.
The defendant is also well fortified with
witnesses and attorneys.
Beal's set-off to his wife's complaint is
general shiftlessuess and a temper that
has no bounds. One of Beal's witnesses
testified that he had been shown through
the Beal home a day or two after tbe
couple had separated and found things in
dire confusion, and dirt everywhere. There
was dirt in the sugar, coffee, butter, pota
toes and around the rooms. Another said
that Mrs. Beal used language on many
occasions which could not be repeated,
and he once saw her spit in Beat's face.
On one occasion, according to the evi
dence, Mrs. Beal came in with her mother,
when Beal was finishing a photograph of
his mother-in law. Mrs. Beal called her
husbaiid a "fool" and remarked that if the
picture had been for any one except his
mother-in-law it would have been finished
long before.
SAN RAFAEL TRIAL.
Convict Kelley's Fate Rests With Twelve
of Bis Peer*.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., July 25. -The case
of the People vs. JoUn Kelley, who killed
a fellow-convict named Arrison in San
Quentin Prison, wa? given to the jury be
fore noon to-day. It ia believed to-night
that there is very little chance of an agree
ment. The jury is said to stand ten for
conviction of murder and two for acquittal
or conviction of a lesser crime.
The trial occupied the Superior Court
ten days, during which fifty convicts were
brought here to testify, thirty-rive of them
being for the defense. All* of the Jatter
told the same story, though they were di
vided into three or four divisions, each
division having its separate phase of the
encounter. They declared that the mur
dered man was tbe aggressor; that he had
the knife and tried to kill Kelley, and that
Kelley slew him in self-defense!
SANTA CRUZ ENCAMPMENT

Chairman.
BANTA CRUZ, Cal., July 25.â The con
vention of Christian women at Gartield
Park closed its sessions this morning,
after a financial address by Rev. R. H.
Bateman and a report on junior work by
Mrs. H. Shadle. The State work commit
tee suggested the employment of a State
organizer and a reduction of the number
of districts to four. Another suggestion
was for the assistance of the Santa Cruz
church from the appropriation, and also
the observance of educational and Ann
Arbor day. The committee favored woman
suffrage and extended thants to San
Francisco and Santa Cruz papers. A mis
sionary address was delivered just before
the noon hour by Rev. E. Lewis of Grass
Valley, in which* he insisted tbat Chris
tians should slight all else rather than the
cause of God.
The church convention opened at 1 r. m.
The president, Rev. J. E. Denton, appointed
A. R. McCullough, George Green weÂ»l and
L. McCray as a presidential committee.
After the enrollment of delegates Hon. A.

San Joaquin County Fair.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 25.â The board
of directors of the Ban Joaquin Agricultu
ral Association met to-day and decided to
hold a pavilion display here â¢ during fair
ween. It has been a mooted questen for
some time as to whether there would be
any exhibition in the pavilion, for the rea
son that last year this part of the fair ran
.the directors in debt. The horse-racing at
the track always pays, but of late the dis
play in the agricultural pavilion has left
the management â  in a : rears. It was
thought that there would be a bitter right
against holding another exhibition in the
pavilion, but this afternoon, when the di
rectors met, all Toted for the pavilion dis
play. The Hawaiian band will be secured
for the week. .

O. Morse of the Electric Licht company
was to-day nearly killed by asphyxiation
while trying to make a connection with

He telephoned to the works to have the
gas shut off, but, through some one's
stupidity, it was turned on before the
signal was given. The new pas, made by
the water process and used only in Santa
Barbara thus far has no odor, and
its escape cannot be readily detected. A

chanced to look into the trench and saw
Morse lyins^there to all appearances dead.
He was at once lifted out, and with ditli

YOLO COUNTY'S
McKINLEY CLUB,
Republicans Organize at a
Mass - Meeting in
Woodland
UNITE FOB PROSPERITY
Standard-Bearers of the Party
Cheered by an Enthusiastic
Gathering.
LENGTHY ROLL OF MEMBERS
E i E. Gaddis Electrd Permanent Chair
msn of the Protectionist
Band.
WOODLAND, Cal., July 25.â Several
hundred voters attended the mass-meet
ing held in the City Hall last night to or
ganize a McKinley and Hobart club for
Yolo County. Had any one donbted that
McKinley enthusiasm was alive in
this community, his doubts would have
been dispelled by an attendance at this
gathering. The champion of protection
was cheered to the echo and the good feel
ing was unbounded.
The meeting was called to order by At
torney Gd E. Guadis, chairman of tbe
Republican County Central Committee,
who delivered an address full of patriot
ism and protection. Oscar Chalmers was
placed in nomination for temporary chair
man and was elected by acclamation.
The club then perfected a permanent
organization by electing the following
officers: Ed E. Gaddis, president; County
Clerk G. L. Duncan, vice-president; Virgil
Fennier, secretary; William H. Curson,
treasurer; City Trustee C. M. Hiddleson,
Jndge Ruggles, J. O. Chalmers, Vet Farn
ham and R. Fitz were elected members of
the executive committee, with the presi
dent and vice-president ex-offlcio mem
bers. It was unanimously decided' to call
the new organization the McKinley and
Hobart Republican Club of Yolo County.
A committee consisting of William Ervin,
C. P. Belzari and John Barci was ap
pointed by the president to solicit mem
bership. J. H. Dungnn, Oscar Chalmers
and Judge Ruggles will draft by-laws for
the club, and report nt the next meeting.
A large number of new members were
secured, making 160 in all, a large roll for
a starter. The next meeting will be held
at the call of the executive committee.
At the close of the business session Hon.
R. Clark, candidate for Congress in the
Third District, was called upon and deliv
ered a ringing Reyub'ioan speech. He
was heartily cheered.
Chairman Gaddis proposed three cheers
for McKinley and Hobart, and they were
given with a will.
FUSION IN WASHINGTON.
Silver factions Stay Unite on a State
Ticket. ; "
. SEATTLE, Wash., July 25.â "William J
Bryan has attained the greatest personal
triumph ever accorded a man in securing
nominations from three National conven
tions," exclaimed Hon. John Wiley, the
Republican free-silver champion of this
State, upon the announcement this after
noon that the Nebrusican had been named
by the National Populists. "And this
great utilising," Mr. Wiley continued,
"recalls Colonel Rhea's declaration when
placing Joe Blackburn in nomination â an
utterance which, I think, should live in
history â that 'freedom's battles' are not
fought out at bankers' banquets,' and it
also suggests that great economic and po
litical questions are not studied out over
mahogany tables."
Bryan's third nomination has caused
unbounded 'enthusiasm among bis sup
porters in Seattle. ' Democrats, Populists
and Free-silver Republicans are massing
into one political family, and indications
are that there will be a general fusion on
all State offices. The clans have called for
a mass-meeting to ratify Bryan's third
and, perhaps, last nomination, for July
SO. , By that time Washington's delega
tions to the St. Louis conventions will
have returned.
2 Wholesale and commission houses of
this city have organized a Bryan club
roll.
Upon his return from â  Chicago Hon.
William H. White, chairman or the
Washington delegation to the National
Democratic Convention, in discussing the
action of National Committeeman Hugh
Wallace of Tacoma in refusing to vote for
Bryan, said that it was due to that little
remark in the now famous speech of the
Democratic candidate for President,
wherein ne said that if any wanted a crit
icism of the United States Supreme Court
on the income tax law, they should read
the dissenting opinion of the judges who
failed to concur in the decision. Chief
Justice Fuller, who wrote the decision, is
the father-in-law of Wallace, and the re
marks of Bryan annoyed Wallace.

MESSMORE'S CANDIDACY.
The Congrffional Aspirant Defines His
Position.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., July 35.â Colonel
Messmore has issued this announcement
of his candidacy for the Democratic nomi
nation for Congress:
I take this method of announcing to the
voters of the Sixth Congressional District that
] shall "be a candidate for nomination before
the convention to bo held at Ventura on the
4th day of August, 188tt. It is proper that
every man who presents himself for Congres
sional honors should let the voters know just
where he stands upou the vital issues of the
hour. The platform adopted by the conven
tion at Chicago, which placed Bryan and
Bewail in nomination, meets my unqualified
approval in every particular.
T.iat platform is a second declaration of in
dependence, a bow oJ promise to the strug
gling millions of tMs country against the op
pression of the money and corporate power*
not only of our own country out of Europe
â¢lap.
The remonetlzfttion of silver, which is the
vital question of tbe great contest before us, is
an open declaration of war against the great
est crime of the century, the crowning infamy
of the Republican partyâ the destruction of
half of tiie metallic money of the Nation ami
the direct cauÂ«c of ita destruction by all the
Latin commercial nations. I have fought this
infamous act since 1873. That act is the parent
of the army of tramps and unemployed all over

FRESNO REPUBLICANS.
Two Hundred Members of the' Party

. FRESNO, Cal., July 25.â Two hundred
enthusiastic Republicans, and represen

in this city to-night. The purpose of the
meeting was merely to form a temporary
organization and set the movement on
foot.' . It was to have been held in Justice
Austin's courtroom, but: at 8 o'clock the
room was crowded, and the meeting ad
journed to Kutner Hall. .. . . â 
The meeting was called to order-by;
President G. C. Freeman of the County
Central club. Judge 8. C. St. John was
elected temporary chairman and Harry
W. Skinner secretary. As Judge St.
John assumed the chiir there was an out
burst of applause, which evidenced that
there is still that enthusiasm in the Re
publicans of Fresno which has character
ized them from the time when there were
only two members of the party in the
county.
Notwithstanding the boasts of those of
other political faiths that the Republican
party in Fresno County is now dead, there
were more citizens in attendance when
Judge St. John picked up the gave! at the
McKinley club* meeting than have at
tended any Democratic or Populist meet
ing of a similar nature held in this city.
A. L. Hobbs, W. H. Spencer, P. H.
Short, George W. Jones and Judge S. L.
Carter were appointed a committee on
permanent organization, to report next
Saturday evening, when the club will
meet again. Frank Short, Judge Carter
and M. V. Ashbrook delivered stirring
speeches, which were enthusiastically ap
plauded.
Tbe Republicans feel much gratified to
night over the success of tbe meeting, and
it srave many of them encouragement in
their determination to place Fresno in the
list of Republican counties of the Stale
next November.

DEBATERS AT TULARE.
Piitsbury and Martin Conclude Their
Financial Argument.
TULA RE, Cal., July 25.â The join
debate between A. J. Pillsbury, for gold,
ana Hon. J. W. Martin, for silver, con
cluded to-night. They spoke to a large
and impartial audience.
The meeting was called to order by Mrs.
W. W. Wnittington. Martin opened the
debate by paying a glowing tribute to the
fair sex and declaring for equal suffrage.
He eulogized Miss Susan B. Anthony,
much to the delight of the audience.
Martin, who is an elector on the Bryan
and Sewall ticket, claimed that the pros
perity of a country depended upon the
amount of circulating medium in that
country, citing facts and figure? â >. proof
of hia contention. Pillsbury pro red con
clusively that the circulating medium had
constantly increased for the past twenty,
years, yet good times were not keeping
pace with the increase of money. Martin
claimed there was a per capita circulation
of but $5 in this country. Pillsbury said
the United States Treasurer's report,
rendered on July 1, 1896, gave a per-capita
circulation of $21 15.
The debate was courteously conducted
and heartily enjoyed by the auditors.
Pillsbury leaves to-night for San Fran
cisco to assume his duties as secretary of
the bureau of literature of tbe Republican
State Central Committee.

With Fifty Swimmers.

aged 22, a son of William Harvey, was
drowned while bathing at the swimming
baths to-night. Tbe young man was an
expert swimmer, but it is believed that he
had exhausted himself in playing on a
trapeze ani then jumped into the water.
There were no symptoms of cramps.
Ike Hyde, a real-estate agent, was swim
ming at the time. He saw the young man
come to the surface and throw his hands
up, but Mr. Hyde believed Unit he was
shamming. Tliere were about fifty bathers
in the tank when Harvey was drowned,
but the body was in the water for an hour
before it was known that the young man
had been drowned. Joe Landrurn and
Harvey had gone in swimming together.
At the end of an hour and a half Land rum
left the tank. He did not see his com
panion, abd supposed he had gone to their
dressing-room. When he went to tbe
room he found both suits of clothes as
they had left them.
Landrum went hack to the tank and
after a search found the body at the bot
tom. A year ago to-morrow Harvey's
brother was drowned in the southern part
of the State.

SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., July 25.â
About eighty miles north of Mojave ia an
Institution known as the San Bernardino
Borax Works. In the years before the
enactment of the Wilson-Gorman tariff
law, about 100 soen were employed at
the works, each receiving not less than
$60 a month and board. There were six
drivers of mule teams, which freighted
the borax to Mojave. These received $125
per month for their services and the
swampers about the marsh received $85.
Five stations were established between the
works and Mojave, with large farms and
houses where a number of people were
employed at good salaries. A trip from
tbe borax wotks to Mojave was made
every eight days with three twenty-two
mule teams, hauling sixty tons, from
which was realized, under the McKinley
law, $400 per ton.
To-day borax would bring but $50 per
ton, because of the withdrawal of the pro
tection afforded by the McKinley tariff.
Under present conditions, of course, the
works have closed and hundreds of men
are thrown* out of employment. The
busy whirl of machinery has ceased.
The big wagons are no longer used, and
the mules have been sold, given away or
are idly "eating their heads off." The
shouts of men have died away. A keeper
takes care of the company's property, and
tbe owners are awaiting the return of pro
tection and the prosperity sure to follow
the election of William McKinley and a
Republican Congress. Then the works
will be reopened.
TULARE COUNTY POPULISTS.
Many Opposed to the yomlnalion of
Bryan at St. Louis.
VISALIA, Cal., July 25.â 1t is believed
that there will be trouble among the
Populists in this county when Delegate
Gilstrap returns from St. Louis. To-day
bis partner and co-editor of the Weekly
News received the following telegram :
Populists crucified ou tbe crosa of Democ
racy by supposed friends. No bolt.
Gilstrap is a middle-of-the-road man,
and before leaving for Chicago announced
his intention of bolting should the convt. n
tion indorse or nominate Bryan. He was
supported in his radical views by Alfred
Daggett of this city, who was also a dele
gate to the convention. Sentiment seems
to be divided among the Populists in this
place. Some are pleased over the result,
while many do not take kindly to being
swallowed by the Democracy.
Bedding's Ratification.
REDDING, Cal., July 25,â Redding was
ablaze with fireworks and illumination to
night, and the noise of cannons and
bombs awoke the echoes. The Democrats
and Populists ratified the nomination of
William Jenning Bryan. Speeches were
made by both Democrats and Populists,
and every mention of Bryan's name and j
of free silver was applauded. Thomas B.
Dozier, a prospective candidate for Con
gress m this district, was the principal {
speaker. D. N. Honn, Judge Bell, C. H.

Oakland harbor on the south, and is subdivided Into large blocks, bounded by wide streets, : newly
grade;! and graveled, and ornamented with avenues of trees, cypress hedges and evergreen groves.
Upward of 1193 lots have been sold to bona-nds Investors since tbe townsite was platted and placed

And LOTS MORE Equally Low.ARRESTED BY SAN
MATEO'S SHERIFF,
Mrs. Alice Burns Taken
Into Custody at
Woodland.
ACCUSED OF FORGERY.
Arraigned at Redwocd City on
Charges Preferred by Her
Mother-in-Law.
RELEASED ON GABH BAIL.
The Young Woman's Parents Say
She Was an Involuntary
Offender.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., July 25.â An
alleged small transaction in this county
led to the arrest of Mrs. Alice Burns at the
home of her father in Woodland and her
appearance to-day before Justice Hannon
upon a charge of fonjery. The complain
ant against Mrs. Burns is^an old lady who
lives on Ellis street in San Francisco, Mrs.
Cornelia Burns, a widow. She is Mrs.
Alice Burns' mother-in-law. She alleges
in her complaint that her daughter-in-law
forged her sienature to a deed to property
in fan Mateo, iv what is known as tbe
Western Addition. This complaint, which
was issued in San Francisco, was signed
by her mother-in-Jaw with a trembling
hand. The handwriting indicates that
clearly.
The next step was to arre3t Mrs. Alice
Burns at Woodland. Sheriff McEvoy
went up to Yolo County for this purpose
and returned this morning with Mrs.
Burns in his custody. The affair created a
sensation in two counties. The father of
Mrs. Alice Burns i? a well-known citizen
oi Woodland â J. H. Holiingsworth, who
owns considerable property. His daugh
ter is also well known in Yolo County,
being young, vivacious and good looking.
The advent of Sheriff McEvoy with his
fair prisoner caused & sensation here when
the nature of the charge became Known.
Mrs. Alice Burns does not appear to be
over 30 years old. She was handsomely
dressed.
The ladylwas accompanied by her
father and husband to Redwood City. Her
father was much astonished and shocked
at the nature of tlie charge and made
preparations to provide cash bail. Immedi
ately upon the arrival of the party the
services of a local attorney were engaged
that Mrs. Burns might not be sent to jail.
An appearance was then made before
Justice Hannon, Mrs. Burns remaining in
the custody of the Sheriff for the time.
There were only two or three persons in
court. District Attorney Walker was
there, but took no part in the proceedings.
George C. Ross, acting as Mrs. Burn:.' at
torney, asked that the bail should be fixed
as Low as possible and intimated that cash
bail would be furnished. Justice Hannon
i'ixed the amount at $500 cash and this
was immediately given by Mr. Hollings
worth, who put ud his check at the Bank
of San Mateo County for thnt sum.
Mrs. B^rns was then released from the
custody of the Sheriff. Some telegrams
were sent, and this afternoon a long con
ference took place in Lawyer Ross' office.
Mrs. Burns, acting under her attorney's
advice, declined to De interviewed.
The complaint aeta forth that Alice
Burns forged the signature of Mrs. Cor
neiia Burns to a deed granting to Christ
Copp lot 7 in block 18, in the Western
Addition to San Mateo, with intent to
defraud Christ Kopp. According to par
ties here, the transaction has a previous
history. Tne same property was first
mortgaged, so Ban Mateo Count}' officials
assert, and at that time $300 was raised,
which wtnt to the winds at the racetrack.
Then the property was conveyed, as is
alleged, by Mrs. Alice Burns to Kopp.
The small bail in thÂ«* case covers probably
more than the full value of the property
in question.
Mrs. Cornelia Burns has two sons both
married. In conversation with the officers
here Mrs. Alice Burns conveyed the im
pression that family disensions had some
thing to do with the matter. Mrs. Alice
Burns and her father departed this even
iug for Woodland.
Toe hearing of evidence before Justice
Hannon will take place on August 10.
AS INVOLUNTARY FORGER.
Mr: Jturna Said to Have Simply Obeyed
Her Mothrr-in- JLaw.
WOODLAND, Cal.. July 25.-The arrest
of Mrs. Alice Burns, daughter of J. H.
Hollingaworth, one of Woodland's most
highly respected and wealthiest citizens,
upon her -arrival from Redwood City last
night, has created a sensation here, and
her most intimate friends are confident
that Mrs. Burns will be vindicated. Her
mother, Mrs. Hollingsworth, gave the
following version of the affair to the press
to-day:
"I am confident that my daughter has
done nothing wrong. Several months ago
Mrs. Burns and her husband were living
in San Francisco ana Grandma Burns, as
she is usually called, was living with
them. Her health had been poor for a
long time and this, coupled with the busi
ness depression, had reduced her finances
to a low ebb. One day she called her son
and daughter-in-law into her room and
requested them to go to Redwood City
and place a mortgage on one of two lots
which she owned there, as she nrgentiy
needed money. So she instructed them
to sign her name to the instrument.
"My daughter objected to doing that as
she feared shÂ« would be liable to arrest.
Grandma Burns assured hex that her fears
were unfounded; that as soon as her
health permitted she would acknowledge
the deed and no trouble would arise.
"At last my son-in-law and daughter
were persuaded to go down to San Mateo
and place a mortgage on one of the lots,
Alice signing the uarne of old lady Burns
and her husband signing tbe name of
Grandma Burns' husband. They returned
to San Francisco and instead of turning
the money over to bis mother Burns com
menced to play the races and lost quite
heavily.
'Of course, when Grandma Burns was
able to be around again she wanted ncr
money and demanded it cf her daughter
in-law. Then there was trouble and a
suit was brought against Alice to recover
the amount. The forgery still stood on
record, as the old lady would not rectify it
as she promised, although my daughter
repeatedly requested her to do so. Attor
ney Hawkins of this City went down to
San Mateo County and the matter was ar
ranged in a manner which we thought was
satisfactory to everybody.
"After these matters bad been settled my
daughter persuaded hÂ«r husband to send
his mother to live vritli a son-in-law, as
Alice was in poor health herself, and de
clared that life with his mother following
the circumstances related vui impossible.
Burns acted on her advice and then he
and his wife went to ban Mateo to live,
thinkincr the change would benefit my
daughter's health. She gradually grew
worse and concluded to take a tr>p north,
which she did, returning last night. Tho
.-jrest is suppose:! to have been at the in
stigation of Burnt' brother-in-law, who is
angry because Grandma Burns was forced
on his family. Tnis is about all there Is in
the matter. lam satisfied that my daugh
ter has done nothing criminal."
Her father werit down with her this
morning to furnish any amount of bonds
requirea. "

LOS ANGELES SHOOTING,
Police Detective Bradish Kills a
Burglar and Is Badly
Wounded.
Duel to the Death at the Doorway
of a Residence the Prowler
Hid Entered.
Loe Angeles Office of The Call,)
328 Sorm Broadway, V
Los Angeles, Cal., July 25. )
Police Detective A. J. Bradish ?hot and
killed a burglar to-night at 9 o'clock. It
was by tbe merest caance that the officer
was not killed himself. He will carry to
his grave the mark: of a bullet from the
prowler's revolver.
The shooting occurred in the residence
of I. N. Van Nuys, at the corner of Myth
and Spring streets. Members of the
household were absent attending the Dem
ocratic ratification.
Spacious grounds surround the house
and Special Watchman T. Campbell is
employed to look after the place. Camp
bell noticed a lieht moving on the upper
floor of tbe residence. He knew from this
that a burglar was inside and hurried to
telephone to the police. Detective Brad
ish was at the station and mounting his
bicycle he rode to the Van Nuys residence.
Detective Goodman and Officer Robbms
hurried after him on foot.
Bradish entered the front yard and went
to the rear door to gain an entrance. Fail
ine in this, he waited around to the front
of tbe house. Just as he reached the front
steps the door opened and o man stepped
out. Tbe detective told him to halt and
rushed toward him.
The robber jumped back and swung the
door almost enut, leaving only his shoul
der and the Bide of his head exposed.
While in this position he fired at the
officer, who was only five feet away. The
bullet entered the left cheek and ranged
upward, coming out just below the ear
and nipping a part of that member. The
burglar then drew back and started to
close the door, but Bradish was too quick.
Throwing up his revolver he fired three
times at the closing door, behind which
tbe burglar was standing.
After tbe first shot the door was closed
and latched, and, try as he could, the
officer could not open it. Bradis h was not
sure that he hit the burglar, as the leliovr
had uttered no sound. He stationed
officers to guard the house, while the
watchman let him and other officers
through the rear door.
They discovered the burglar lying dead
behind the frontdoor.
O nly one bullet had taken effect. It en
tered on the right side of the head, over
the eye, and ranged diagonally out on the
Other side near the ear, death having been
instantaneous.
The body was removed to undertaking
parlors, while Detective Bradish went to
the Receiving Hospital, where his Wound
was dressed. Nothing was found on the
dead man which would lead to identifi
cation.

TERRILL IS KING
AT SACRAMENTO,
The Bay City Cycler Wins
Easily Against All
Comers.
HIRSCH SHOWS SPEED.
Beats Chapman in an Exciting
Finish in the Half-Mile
Handicap.
OSEN GETS INTO TROUBLE.
Ruled Out for Deliberately Crowding
Whitman Against the
Fence.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. July 25.â The
final nigtt of the indoor bicycle tourna
ment had lor an opener a race against tbe
one-mile record. George M. Hamiin,
S. F. R. C, paced by Languetin and Dixon
on a tandem, made tbe attempt. The
half was made in :59 1-5, boating the
world's record, and the mile was made in
2:05 3-5, another smash. It would prob
ably have been two seconds iasler, but
through negligence the bell failed to an
swer the final lap and the finish sprint
was lost.
In the first heat of the half-mile, scratch,
amateur, Languetin made a great ride,
starting at scratch, catching his men in
the second lap and made a lightning sprint
at the finish. Chapman also made a great
ride in the final two-mile scratch. Start
ing at the pole be was never headed by his
field, who pushed him hard in a lightning
finish, with Mott a half-length behind.
The pride of Sacramento to-night is
Jacob Hirsch, who won in a hard ride
against Chapman, the finish "bringing
' down" the house in an uproar of applause.
! The king of the trace was W. A. Terrill,
who always had his races well in hand and
beat every one he went against. O. Osen
is accused by some of the wheelmen of foul
riding throughout the tournament. In
the final of the mile professional he de
liberately crowded Whitman into the
fence and was promptly ruled out by Ref
eree W. C. Fawcett. who says that he will
recommend his suspension. As Osen left
tbe track he struck at Whitman, but was
promptly overpowered.

NATIONAL GUARD
IS CRITICIZED,
The Annual Report of the
Division Inspector Pre
sented.
NAVAL RESERVE SCORED
Action Recommended on Disap
pearance of Rifles and
Clothing.
OFFIOEKS ABE RESPONSIBLE.
Armories Rented by the State Are
for Dancing, Not for
Drilling.
Lieutenant-Colonel John C. Currier, di
vision inspector, N. G. C, has submitted
his annual report on the National Guard
of California to Colonel A. E. Castle, as
sistant adjutant-general, division N. G. C,
San Francisco.
The report comprehends the annual in
spection and muster of the Division Na
tic jal Guard. One year ago the division
consisted of three brigades, ten regiments,
sixty-nine companies, representing a total
strength of 4411, officers and men. By the
consolidation under general orders Nos. 17
and 18, dated December 7 and 9, 1895, the
organizations have been reduced to fifty
seven companies, consisting of one divis
ion organized into three brigades, five
regiments, four troops of cavalry, five di
visions of naval reserve, having a total
strength of 4229. The numerical reduc
tion, therefore, in the National Guard has
been only 182 men.
The inspections were conducted
throughout the division by Brigade In
spectors Major J. W. F. Dlss of the First
Brigade, Major Charles Jansen, Second
Brigade, and Major Frank S. Rice, Third
Brigade, in connection with Captain Car
rington, First Infantry, U. S. A-, detailed
as inspector and instructor of the staff of
the commander-in-chief; and also by
Colonel Currier. The adjutant-general of
the State was present at a large number of
inspections. Every company in the State
was inspected by one of these officers, and
in most cases by three â the division and
brigade inspectors and Captain Carring
ton, U. S. A. Inspections began March 15
and ended May 26. Every company was
given some exercises in drilling, company
movements, in the manual oi arms anil
extended order. This was done princi
pally in the streets, fortherearon as stated
in the wport:
"The armories in most instances were too
small and being used for entertainments
and dancing assemblies, the floor was fre
quently found to be so smooth as to render
marching very difficult." On this point
the following recommendation is made:
Wherever it is possible the streets should be
used for drilling instead of the armories; it
would not only give greater freedom of move
ment and admit of greater precision in drill, but
would enable the troopÃ to execute the turn
ing? in quick and double time without ganger
of falling, giving the men. greater confidence
in themselves, thereby better fitting them for
actual service.
The First Brigade comprises the Seventh
Infantry â twelve companies stationed in
Los Angeles, San Diego and vicinity and
two companies of cavalry at Los Angeles
and Salinas respectively. In the Seventh
Company B of ban Diego grades 4.80, the
highest in order of merit of any company
in the State, and the largest in numerical
strength, its maximum being 10H.
Comoany A of Los Angeles grades the
lowest in order of merit, due largely to the
disappearance of its captain, which de
moralized the company.
The other infantry companies of the
Seventh are up to the average. Troop D
of Los Anceles, in the language of the re
port, "presented rather an unsatis.actory
appearance; they showed lack of discipline
and knowledge of duties, carelessness in
their company movements and sabre exer
cise. Their arms and equipments were in
good condition. The muster-rolls were im
properly made out, were returned for cor
rection, and much delay was experienced
in recovering them. Since the day of in
spection both the captain and first lieuten
ant have resigned."
Since the inspection a second examina
tion of the troop was made and much im
provement noted in drill, discipline and
appearance.
Troop C of Salinas under Captain Burke
turned out sixty mounted men, nearly all
of whom own their own horses. In disci
pline, drill, sabre exercise, etc, they rank
well, and have impressed the inspectors
favorably.
The consolidation of the regiments in
Southern California produced Deneficial
effects and materially lessened expenses of
the command.
The Second Brigade consists of the First
and Fifth Infantry, Signal Corps and
Troop A, Cavalry. Company F of the
Fint in San Francisco ranks highest in
order of merit. It had eighty-seven on
the rolls at the time of inspection. The
lowest in order of merit is Company E.
Companies D, G, I and X had 100 per
centum at inspection. Out of 935 men
9C6 were present at inspection, and the
average merit of the entire regiment is
4.28, a few points higher than any other
regiment in the division. The report re
views the First as follows:
This regiment since its reorganization has
had some difficulties to contend with in the
way of harmonizing the various interests
thrown together under new r.ffieers losing
t heir old company letter;--, under which many
of them had marched and served so many years
changing of armories and trainine of recruits'
etc. ; bnt with a true soldierly spirit they ac
cepted the situation and are almost univer
sally adapting themselves to their new con
dition, and loyal to their new commanding
officer, Colonel McDona'.d, and are rapidly be
coming a strong and efficient regiment, in
whlcti the City of San Francisco can have con
fidence and should be proud.
Acting on t c suggestion of Major Jan
sen, the Division Inspector says:
I invite your attention to his recommenda
tiodastothe armory, corner Page and Gough
streets. It should be made secure against sud
den attack by a mob. In a city like San Fran
cisco, where there is such a large floating pop
ulation and unruly element, the armories
should be made difficult of access by an un
authorised body of men, and the windows on
the ground floor barred.
The report adds that there are serious
deficits in several companies of the First,
particularly with regard to hats, panta
loons. le<-gings. blouses and canteens.
The Fifth Regiment, stationed in San
Jose, Oakland, Petaluma, San Rafael, Santa
Rosa and Napa was not affected toaTiy ex
tent by the reorganization and retains its
old higD standard and esprit dv corps.
Company F of Oakland ranks highest in
order of merit. Company Eof Santa Rosa
ranks lowest, 3.65. The report says of tne
Fifth :
The personnel of this regiment is excellent;
the men as a rule are healthy and strong and
take pride in their respective companies. The
towns in which they- are situated warmly sup
port them, although the town .of Napa could
exhibit more commendable pride and interest
in their young company, which is struggling
to maintain itself.
The signal corps is reported as of a very
high standard of excellence.
Cavalry Troop A of fan Francisco is
criticized for not haying shown the
efficiency expected of it. Its comj>any
movements and saber exercise were fairly
well executed.
Tha Third Brigade, comprisine the Sixth
Infantry, located in the San Joaquin Val
ley; the staff, signal corps. Troop B. cav
alry, and the Second Infantry, situated in
the Sacramento Valley, were inspected by
Major F. S. Rice, a retired United States
army officer. In the Sixth only one com
panyâC of Fresno â had 100 per cent
present at inspection. The highest in or
der of merit is company H of Merced, and
the lowest, D of Modesto.
The Second with eipht companies had
487 men present at inspection. Company
C of Nevada City ranks highest in order of
merit, and Fof Woodland lowest. This
regiment was somewhat affected by reor
ganization and consolidation, but it is
rapidly recovering from its temporary em
barrassment. The want of uniformity in
uniforms . and equipments calls out a
recommendation that the troops should
be properly equipped.
A recommendation is also made that the
muskets, model of 1873, in the hands of
the National Guard cannot be replaced too
soon by a more modern and effective arm.
Says the report:
"A large proportion of the guns are
worn out ana should be condemned. They
are unreliable, and these facts being
known to the men cannot help but create
distrust and uncertainty should they be
called upon to go into active service."
Attention is called to the lack of blank
ets and other articles for field service.
Companies should provide themselves
with a mess outfit for field service of uni
form pattern.
The inspections show that the Naval
Battalion is "in fair condition, composed
of excellent men, armed with Lee magazine
rifles and Colt revolvers."
The division at San Dieeo turned out
well and exhibited an excellent spirit.
They executed the movements on the
street and in the armory very commend
ably, but the attendance at muster was
not up to the standard of the guard. The
Eureka division, having been changed
within a year from an infantry company.
Las labored under some disadvantage, but
it is adapting itself rapidly to its new con
dition under good officers.
The division at Santa Cruz is reported
in good condition. The men turned out
well at inspection and performed the com
pany movements well, especially that in
the not drill. With regard to the San
Francisco divisions the report says that
the books, records and equipments of the
Second Division were neatly stored and
cared for. The bearing of the men was
excellent, and they exhibited considerable
pride and interest in their organization.
This is what is written of the First Di
vision inspection:
The arms and equipments of this division
were brought to the boathouse in great disor
der late, although ample time had been al
lowed.
All its property shows great neglect and care
lessness in the handling. In many of the
rifle? the sights are broken.
At the inspection and muster In the evening
the men appeared careless and indifferent,
and seemed to lack respect for their officers.
In both the First and Second divisions there
are very serious deficits, as shown by their
property returns, unii their commanders should
be called upon for an immediate explanation.
These commands have been organized within
ihree years, and were supplied with the very
best quality of clothing, arms and equipments.
Why there should be a deficit of eleven rifles
in one command and seven In another; of
forty-two uniform pantaloons in one and forty
eight in another; also a serious shortage in
hiits, caps, shirts, white pantaloons, blankets,
neckerchiefs, k-ggins, pouches, etc., for which
they are responsible, has not been explained.
I recommend that action he taken against the
officers responsible for the serious shortage in
the property for which they are accountable
to the State.
In conclusion, Colonel Currier states he
considers the guard to-day in a much bet
ter condition than it was a year ago.
it was recommended that Lieutenant-
Colonels Thomas M. Cluff, Jnrnes F.
Smith, Frert F. Folils and George R. Bur
dick be assigned to positions on tne gen
eral's staff.
THE GRAND JURY.
It Will Hold a Special Meeting To-
Morrow to Consider the Matter of
Reduced Assessments.
Foreman Frank Maskey of the Grand
Jury has issued a second notice addressed
to every member of that body inviting
them to attend a special meeting to-mor
row to consider tne matter ol tne recent
â reduction of assessments by the Super
visors.
Mr. Maskey declines to disclose in ad
vance of the meeting the course that th<>
jury will likely pursue. He says the state
ment is incorrect that an agreement has
been reached to ill t- an accusation of will
iul misconduct in office against the Super
visors.
Horace D. Dunn, the expert of the Grand
Jury, is said to be at work on the final re
port. He is busy on important work of
some character.
ACTIVITY IN THE POTRERO
The Union Iron Works' New
Buildings Assuming Pre
sentable Shape.
Napa Street to Be Paved, Curbed and
Pat in Decent Condi
tion.
In the vicinity of the Union Iron Works
and Rolling-mill there is a stir of activity
in the general line of improvements that I
augurs well for the Potrero people.
The new building lor the Union Iron
Works office on the north side of Napa
street has assumed a pleasing aspect. The
second story is in place and in the course
of a few weeks the roof will cover the
structure, and before the end of the year
1896 the company will have an elegant
suite of offices, a necessity long felt by the
department at the seat of operation. The
old offices in the basement of the boiler
shop were inconvenient and in such a
scattered location that bookkeepers,
daugntsmen and clerks were compelled to
work by gaslight during the daytime.
Further east and on the same side of
Napa street the concrete foundation has
been laid for the new boiler-shop, where a
substantial brick and iron building will be
erected.
In addition to these modern buildings
Napa â or as Mr. Vining's railroad men
will insist on calling itâ Twentieth street
â in front of the Union Iron Works prop
erty, is being curbed with dressed granite
blocks, and tnat street from Michigan to
Louisiana will be brought to grade and
paved. This transformation from a mud
hole, in which condition it has been suf
fered to remain for years, will be a boon to
teamsters ami others whose business takes
them to the Union Iron Works and Roll
ing Mill.
If the Supervisors would only pave the
remaining portion of Napa, a distance of
two blocks to Kentucky street, then that
portion of the Potrero would be immensely
benefited and the residents would rejoice
thereat.
Alongside of the rolling-mills wharf the
Blairmore is discharging her ballast of
pijs and scrap iron, with an additional
tonnage of Mission Bay mud.
By the middle of next wee* she will be
free of all her ballast and the mud anl
water will be pumped out of her hold.
After this she will be taken round to tne
Union Iron Works dock and submit her
self to a general overhauline and repairs.
Dr. Wemple, who recently built a two
storv house at the corner of Napa and
Kentucky streets, has had a change of
mind regarding the original plans as
drawn by his architect. Where the entire
front on both streets had small, low win
dows it will now have full glass fronts*with
large elates. This change will involve an
additional expenditure of about $500, but
it will pay in the end, as it will make the
â¢tores all the easier to rent.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
DEMOCRACY AND
PURE PRIMARIES,
The Iroquois Club Finds
the Subject a Hope
less One.
A DISCUSSION ANYWAY.
Reed Says There Never Was a
Decent Local Democratic
Primary.
THE JUNTA PEOPLE SHY OFF.
An Interesting Debate Attend d by
Much Wisdom but No Prac
tical Results.
The Iroquois Clrrb made primary elec
tions the special topic for discussion at its
regular meeting Friday evening, and the
hopeless depravity of Democratic primary
elections was recognized by every man
who talked about the nobility of American
citizenship.
It was Charles Wesley Reed who man
aged to get this rather live topic before
the organization in spite of difficulties.
There were difficulties because Reed has
made party harmony through a general
primary under the Porter law his present
day fad, and because tbe Junta element
|of the Democracy rules the Iroquois Club.
Mr. Reed tried to get "and incidentally
how to harmonize the Democratic party
in San Francisco," coupled with the topic,
"How to hold a pure primnry in San Fran
cisco," but he did not succeed because the
majority element in the club does not
want to agitate the unification of the
party.
The attitude of the Junta and of the
politicians enrolled among its sympa
thizers lit that there is but one faction in
the party â tbe Junta â which is in fact
the party itself. The Buckleyites with
their great majority of votes are ignored
through political necessity, and a general
party primary, at which the rank and file
of the party would have a voice, is bitterly
opposed by the Junta through fear of con
sequences, although the Democratic party
has not held a general primary since 1892.
The Junta powers propose to perpetuate
tne present appointive regime over six
years instead of four.
It was the presence in the Iroquois Club
of a ereat majority in 'support of the
Rainey-Daggett-Lanigan rule that de
nied, by vote, to Mr. Reed the privilege
of discussing party harmony along with
primary elections.
For this reason, and because few Buck
leyite members reappeared at the meeting
last night, there did not occur tne clash of
arms between the two factions tbat had
been expected to attend tbe discussion.
The discussion was confined to the topic
of primary elections â a topic t>f limitless
possibilities, from political, moral, socio
logical, historical, Democratic and humor
ous standpoints.
The discussion began when all the un
important business was ended, and it
closed some little time before the subject
was exhausted, and some little time before
the entire question of municipal primary
elections was settled for ever.
The Buckley faction, it should be un
derstood, had small representation, so far
as numbers went. Reel B. Terry was
there, but he made only side remarks and
left early.
John A. Wall talked and was guyed.
Ex-Postmaster Bryan listened and said
nothing. Robert Boyd attended for the
first time in months, but remained
strancely .speechless.
Among the Junta champions in control
of things wre President Gildea, Vice-
Presidont Walsh, Max Popper, S. P.
Mead, Harry Zemansky, E. P. E. Troy
and others.
Judge Lawler, W. J. Gavigan and C. J.
Bullivan were members of the largest
crowd that has for months attended a
meeting of the Iroquois Club.
An hour or so after the meeting
began, Charles Wesley Reed got a
chance to begin the discussion.
He is a member of the literary commit
tee which furnishes the club topics and
speakers, and he early made the interest
ing announcement that he had been nego
tiating with Professor Ross of Stanford
and Professor Moses of Berkeley to get
them to debate the financial question oe
fore the club. He finally got Ros* to con
sent and then, in his elation, he took his
prize to the Democratic State Central Com
miueo.
This authority decided to keep Ross
muzzled until about xho lastof September,
when a big meeting would be held for his
benefit in Metropolitan Hall, and the
members of tbe Iroquois Club would be
invited to attend.
'â¢Mr. Ross is one of the few political
economists of the country who are in
favor of the free coinage of silver at 16 to
1," Mr. Reed explained.
"What does Mr. Reed mean by saying
'one of the few' political economists, etc. ?"
asked Mr. Moore in indignation.
Before Reed had fairly begun Max Pop
per read a resolution of congratulation and
indorsement, referring to W. H. Alford,
chairman of the new State Central Com
mittee, and W. P. Suliivan, chairman of
the Junta organization, and recognizing
the local party as composed of the Junta.
This resolution was referred to the reso
lutions committee, four of the five mem
bers of which signed it at once, and at the
next meeting the resolution recognizing
the Junta as the municipal Democratic
party will come before the club.
Reel B. Terry at once introduced a sar
castic resolution, thanking "Maximilian"
Popper for his unselfish labors of two
week? in seeing that only "honest" elec
tion officers were appointed. This re
ferre.d to Popper's steering the Junta
nominees before the Election Commis
sioners.
E. P. E Troy had referred a petition
against the extension of tbe Geary-street
franchise, and then Charles WeMeV Reed
got fairly to work on primary elections.
Reed said he would not discuss the sub
ject before a hostile audience and that
there had been a deliberate attempt on
the part of the chairman and others to
prevent such a discussion. He said, what
everybody knew, that Democratic pri
maries haa become ' farcical ; that there
was a "shameful prostitution of the pub
lic" and that bosses regulated conventions
and controlled primaries.
There had not been a decent and fair
primary held in San Francisco, yet the
people bad put in tbe statutes the Porter
primary law, which had never been put in
force in the State.
"We hear such good men as Max Pop
per and Gavin McNab plead for a pare
primary law," said Reed, "but when it
comes to applying the law we have they
have no use for it."
John A. Wall put in an interruption
and Reed turned like the worm, with
"Well, Mr. Wall, the other side is a thou
sand timos worse."
"It never used isinglass tickets," roared
Bob Boyd in defense of the Buckleyites.
Reed expounded the Porter primary law
which no Democrat but bimuelf is inter
estedin, because it makes election offenses
felonies, and the Junta in particular does
not want anything to do with a primary
that will give the party voters a free
chance to say for the first time in six years
who shall compose the County Committee
and the municipal convention.
Reed upheld the constitutionality in the
opinions of . D. M. Delnias and Joseph
Leggett, and urged tne fact that if the
Democrats wanted to create a party com
mittee and a municipal convention ac
cording to the wishes of the party voters
the Porter primary law gave the oppor
tunity.
Reed recalled a speech made by Gavin
McNab, "the Junta leader," November 25
last, at Pioueer Hall, at which he declared
that the first pure and high-grade primary
the party had ever known in San Fran
cisco would be held, and said, "When a
political organization is seeking power it
calls for a fair primary ; when it gets
p^ower it wants no fair primary."
Mr. Reed got off something from Jeffer
son that is pertinent to the local situation
when he quoted that departed statesman
as writing: "A party is democratic In pro
portion as every member composing it has
equal voice in the direction of its concerns
through representatives chosen at brief
intervals."
"I say.m all candor and truth," said
Reed, "that there has not been a fair Dem
ocratic primary in San Francisco for six
y i e i a . r , s ' Â»nd, in 'fact, hardly a primary at
till*
"How will you make the party come out
vote?" asked P. M. Wellin.
'Ihere will enough come out to beat
yÂ°Ui 'put in Robert Boyd.
Reed answered that the respectable
voters did not vote, at primaries, first,
because they knew that the element in
control would win anyway through the
election officers, and, second, because they
knew that there would be lines of men
formed in the interest of bosses, which
would keep them waiting fot hours if they
did not get a black eye for presuming to
vote.
Reed said that the primary held four
years ago by the reorganizes in the name
of purity was "the most vicious ever held
in San Francisco."
Max Popper followed Reed. He ex
plained the difficulty or impossibility of
getting men of character to serve as elec
tion officers and made a plea for nis post
office primary plan, which is calculated to
bring the primary to every man's door.
He doubted the constitutionality of the
Porter primarjrlaw.
Reedâ The organization yon represent
has power to hold a fair primary and se
lect honest election officers.
Popperâ True. But if you knew the
pressure that comes with the se
lection of the election officers.
Thai a where the dog liÂ«s buriedâ in the
character of election officers. I favor
anything that will bring about an honest
Democracy, but don't want it broug.t
about so that power shall not be concen
trated in one man. I love my party and
its principles, but I will hold to evils I
know of rather than fly to those I know
not of.
George H. Francouer took a hand by
saying: "Everything human is a choice
between evils. Shall we submit to a dis
honest primary or to a few men controlling
the Democratic party ? You cannot legis
late honesty and Democracy into any
man. Shall we hold a primary as decently
as we are able to do, or shall we agree to
let a few men say for whom we shall vote?
8. P. Mead, E. P. E. Troy, Samuel Me-
Kee, George A. Cabauiss and others put
in their say, but when the meeting ad
journed the Iroquois Club had made no
impression on the tangled local party
situation.
The New Magulre Club.
The James G. Maguire Clnb of the
Thirty-hrst District was organized Friday
night at Phoenix Hall, corner of Eighth
and Folsom streets. The meeting was
called to order by Senator D. J. McCarthy,
who stated the objects of the organization.
Wiiliam McLaugnlin was elected tem
porary chairman and M. M. Ratigan tem
porary secretary.
The roll was opened and 215 members
signed their names. Resolutions were
adopted indorsing the platform and nomi
nees of the Democratic Convention at
Chicago, also the candidacy of Hon. James
G. Maguire for Congress from the Fourth
Congressional District.
Three cheers were given for Bryan and
Sewall and the Hon. James G. Magu.re,
and the meeting adjourned to meet next
Friday evening at the same time and
place.
Twenty-First Democrats.
The Democrats of the Twenty -first Sen
atorial District held a Bryan and Sewall
mass-meeting at Mowry's Hall, corner of
Grove and Laguna streets, Friday night. J.
Ner.lon presided, and opened the meeting
with general remarks on the outlook. The
principal speaker!* were T. Cari Spelling,
Colonel John O'Byrne and W. D. Grady.
THEY DID NOT AGREE.
The Jury in the Case of Jane
Garcia, Charged With Cruelty,
Is Discharged.
Eleven Were for Acquittal, bat One
Was Firm for Convic
tion.
The case of crueity alleged against Jane
Garcia was tried before Judge Campbell
on Friday, and, although testimony was
presented as to all the circumstances t at
have been related as to the treatment of
the boy Santiago Cabrello, the jury could
not agree. Indeed, eleven were for ac
quittal and only one for conviction.
The boy himself, evidently of weak
mind, told on the stand that he had been
beaten with a stick over the head and on
the throat, that he was compelled to sleep
on the roof and in the hallway of the
house, and when allowed to sleep inside
the house his bed was an old trunk.
Frank Mardons, a neighbor of the
Garcias, testified that the boy had fre
quently came to him crying, saying that
he haa been forced outdoors to sleep.
This had happened so often that he (Mar
dons) had iniormed the Society for the
Prevention ol Cruelty to Children.
Officer McMurray testified that Mrs.
Garcia had admitted to him that she beat
the child.
Margaret Sylvester also testified that
the boy had come to her crying and with
blood over his face, which was badly
scratched.
A number of witnessess appeared in be
half of the defendant, testifying as to her
good reputation. As for herself she de
nied the truth of the charges of cruelty.
Her husband alao did the same.
Attorney A. P. Tread well appeared for
the defendant and E. M. Sweeney for the
society. The jury was out but a few min
utes and returned declaring that they
could not apree, one of their number say
ing that he would stay out all night rather
tnan acquit the defendant. Judge Camp
bell discharged them.
Sntro Bath*.
There will be an entire change of programme
at the Sutro Baths this afternoon and evening.
One of the features will be a polo match be

Mrs. Riddell Reports Pi ogress in Her
Precinct-Ciub Work in San
Hateo County.
"The colored men know what it is to be
deprived of the ballot," said Mrs. Naomi
Anderson yesterday at the Woman Suf
frage Bureau, "and I am sure they will do
what they can to release white and col
ored women from the same humiliating
state of silent slavery."
Mrs. Anderson is a woman of command
ing and magnetic presence, though her
manner is most engaging and- her voice
persuasive and sweet. She seems to have
reached middle life, though she must be
older than she looks, since one of her
proudest boasts is that she was a public
advocate of woman suffrage before the
fifteenth amendment was added to the
constitution, long before the negroes
thought they would ever be able to vote at
all. She is well used to speaking in pub
lic, as her fame as an orator dates back
about a quarter of a century. Every word,
every action, proclaims the lady, while
her reading having been very extensive
she is never at a loss for historical illus
trations. As for politics, the man who is
wiser in that direction is wiae indeed.
"This is a busy place," observed Mrs.
Anderson, glancing about the bureau at
the fair clerks and secretaries, each intent
upon her respective task. "They make
everybody work here, and I, it seems, em
to be no exception. They are going to
Keep me on the trot for six weeks if not

Powell st:eet, near Bush, speaking there
again on Friday night. On Wednesday
and Thursday nights I shall lecture in the
African .Methodist Episcopal Zion Church
on Stockton street, near Sacramento-
Starr King's old church.
"During the following week I shall
labor across the bay. speaking at the First
African Methodist Church ou the 3d and
4th of August and at the African Baptist
Church on the 6th and 7tn. Then 1 must
fly to Los Angeles in order to speak at the
Airo- American League congress, which
will open there on the 11th of August. I
expect to give a number of lectures in tbe
southern metropolis, as the colored popu
lation there is large. I hear they have no
less than five colored churches in that
city. I shall return overland, stopping to
speak at Bakerstield, perhaps at Visalia
and Fresno, at Stockton, and indeed
wherever I can find hearers. I shall then
speak a few umfs here and in Oakland be
fore attacking San Jose and Santa Clara.
Doesn't tnat look just a little lite work?"
Enthusiasm in the cause's favor Â»eerus
to reign at the bureau, which is continu
ally thronged with visitors. The contri
bution box, too, is not altogether neg
lected, though there are visitors who
affect not to see it.
Mrs. Riddell is perfecting the precinct
club organization in San Mateo, and
writes that the outlook is most en

WON IN THE LAST INNING
Debut of the Rejuvenated Cali
fornias in the State
League.
A Game of Baseball That Kept the
Specta : ors in a State of
En husiasm.
Despite the rain a large number of ba?e
ball enthusiasts visited the Folsom-street
grounds yesterday afternoon and wit
nessed as pretty an all-round exhibition of
ball-playing as has been seen in San Fran
cisco this season.
The Califor-nias, who a few days ago de
serted the City League and joined forces
with the State League, made their debut !
in the latter organization, opposing the '
Oaklands, who also formerly belonged to
Manager Rockwell's Presidio Park outfit. !
Tne State League Californias are far from j
being the same club tbat played in the
other association. In fact, only three or
four of ihe members ever wore the uni
form before yesterday. Wilds. Hammond
and McDermott formerly belonged to the
Pacifies and Han ley to a State League
club, while Mack, Billings and White are
new acquisitions.
Whatever are the antecedents of the
players the new Californias put up a strong
game. They beat the hard-hitting Oak
lands at their own game and scored a vic
tory when defeat seemed certain. They
also played a fast fielding game, two of the
three errors charged to them being made
on very hard chances. The other was a
misjudged throw of Hammond.
Tbe Oaklands' may charge their defeat j
to Shay's poor work in the box. He was
wild and uncertain at critical stages, and
in the ninth inning with two men out gave .
McDermott a base on balls, which gift sub- â 
sequent iy lost the came.
It was nip and tuck all the way throueh, j
first one and tben the other of the con- ;
testants being in the lead. At the begin
ning of the last inning the score stood: j
Californias 9. Oaklands 6. Or kland was
first at the bat and Walters led off with a
two-bagger. Shay fouled out. Donovan
lined out. a double, scoring Walters and
tying the score. Every rooter in the
grandstand howled at tbe top of his voice
and the players on the coaching lines
danced innumerable jigs. Hardie struck
out, amid jeers and catcalls. Then Pudgey
Arlett â he of the short legs and rotund
paunch â singled to right and Donovan
scored. For a moment pandemonium
reigned. Then O'Neill retired the side on
a pop fly to Hammond.
Then came Shay's Waterloo. After
Hammond and Tribeau had been retired
on easy flies McDermott got bis base on
balls. Mack bit safely to right, sending
McDermott to second.
Wilds, the Herculean colored player, got
his eye on the ball and swatted it with all
his miuht. It soared swiftly over the in
field, high over the right fielder's head,
and by the time the sphere was returned
to-thb diamond Wilds was on third and
Mack, following McDermott, had scored
the winning run. Then the cheer tbat
went up from tbe stands startled the goats
over on the Potrero.

I Office, San Francisco, Cal. 'TIBURON ANGRY
AT SAUSALITO.
The Result of a Saturday
Night Tug-of-War
Match.
LEGAL TANGLE IN SIGHT
The Fat Gate Receipts Were
Not Turned Over to the
Victors.
WHAT WAS THE AGREEMENT?
The Married Men of Tiburon Will
Pnll Against the Single Men
for a Stake.
The unmarried men of Tiburon are just
spoiling for some kind of a fight with the
single men of Sausalito â a legal battle for
preference, and are only held back by the
lack of a proper method of beginning the
fray.
From the foregoing it mizht be imagined
that the proverbial "woman at the bottom
of it" had got in her deadly work again,
but such is not the case.
In fact a tug-of-war, common, every-day
exhibition of brawn and endurance, is at
the bottom of the row that threatens to as
sume serious proportions for a suburban
quarrel.
There has always been a rivalry between
the single men of Tiburon and Sausalito,
who are mostly young business men of
San Francisco, as to their respective
athletic abilities, and bantering on the
subject while waiting at the ferry for their
boats led to a tug-of-war match between
representative teams.
Tbe pick of the suburban athletes went
into training for the event, which was for
$10 a side and two-thirds of the gate
receipts, the other third being set aside to
pay the expenses of the exhibition. This
was Tiburon's idea of the agreement,
though subsequent development showed
that there was a misunderstanding.
Sausalito was chosen as the battle
ground and last Saturday night saw the
largest hall in that quiet burg crowded
with the admirers of the teams, every
man ready to yell himself hoarse if his
favorite gained an inch.
After a terrific struggle Tiburon won
tbe pull amid the cheers of its partisans,
who kept the town in an uproar for hours
after the match was decided. The stake
was paid to Tiburon, but when it came to
the gate receipts the trouble began.
Sausalito refused to pay over any of tie
receipts, claiming that there bad been no
agreement that the two-thirds of tbe pate,
that amounted to about $150, should go to
tbe winner, but that the match was for the
$10 and the glory of winning. Tiburon
did not care so much for the money, but
it did care for being "played for a sucker,"
as one of its champions remarked, and
now there is no cordiality between the
young men of business when they meet
at the ferry, the "glassy eye" and
the "clammy nand" being tar more in ev
idence.
Tiburon numbers among its young men
a number of rising attorneys, and these
legal lights are trying to figure out
whether to sue the town of Sausalito or
the members of tbe opposing team indi
vidually in civil suits, or whether to get
out warrants on criminal charges.
Tiburon feels very, very sore, and is de
termined on revenge, and devslopments
are looked for in tbe near future.
In the meantime, nowever, the Tiburon
admirers of athletics have determined not
to let tbe tug-of-war epidemic that has
struck the town die out because of the un
pleasantness or for want of encourage
ment. The joking of the married men
regarding tbe failure of the single men to
get any of the gate receipts of the last
match has lei to another match ail in
Tiburon.
Jerry O'Connell has put up $50 for the
unmarried men, while Joseph Â£sasser has
performed a like office for tne benedicts.
The match is to take place in Tiburon
on Saturday night next, and is expected
to eclipse in interest anything that has
taken place there for years.

OPENING AN OLD MINE.
Local Capital Interested in a New
Quartz Mill at Moores
Flat.
Nevads City Trying to Effect a Com*
promise and Control Its
Water Works.
Judge J. M. "Walling of Nevada City
arrived here Friday, and had judgment
entered against the private water company
that has been supplying his town with
water for twenty years.
The town decided some time ago to con
trol its own water supply, and accordingly
voted $60,000 in bonds. Tbe water com
pany, the sole proprietor of which is a
Mrs. Huntington of New York City,
brought suit against the town to enjoin it
from selling the bonds. That injunction
has been defeated. Judge Walling, wno
is attorney for Nevada City, is now mak
ing advances looking to a compromise
with the water company, the iiiea being to
determine upon a price for the old water
works that shall be agreeable to both par
ses. The water company values its plant
at $25,000. As soon as the litigation is
ended the sale of bonds will commence.
An old mine taken in hand this month
by San Francisco capital is now being
prepared for active operations. It is the
old Metropolitan quarts mine at Moores
Fiat, twenty miles from Nevada City. P.
I. Fisher, Professor Davidson and Marcus
L. Davis, ail of this City, are the pro
moters of the new enterprise. They have
twenty men at work now, but a good
many more will be employed as soon as
the machinery shall have*arnved. One of
the new Merrill quartzmills, the first of
Its kind in that country, is to be set up.
The mine has 2000 feet of tunnels in it
already, and it is estimated that there are
25,000 tons of rock in sight. It is gener
ally a low-grade ore, running about |5 to
the ton, though a little of it promises as
high as $20.
CHINATOWN'S FRIGHT.
Report That Fresno Hatchetmen Are
on Their Way to This City With
out Foundation.
Many wild and alarming stories were
circulated in Chinatown day before yes
terday regarding a purported shipment of
a powerful gang of nighbinders from
Fresno bound for this City with tna object
in view of exterminating the Lee Yup
Society.
Lee Yip Dock was mentioned as being
the leader of the Fresno hatchetmen and
also being the president of the Bo Leong
Tong, the most notorious and powerful
highbinder organization in the State. He
was also accredited with being responsible
for the death of Lee Ti, wno was murdered
in Waverly place a few days ago. These
statements have proven to be without
foundation.
Lee Me Ti and Joe Gar, the two Chinese
merchants who first placed the blame of
Lee Ti's murder at the door of Lee Yip
Dock, and incidentally the Kong Chow
Association, are both members of the Bo
Leong Tong. Lee Yip Dock is not a mem
ber ot that organization, and consequently
would have but little influence with its
members.
Sergeant Cook and sqund came across a
room in Clinton street Wednesday even
ing which had evidently been occupied by
highbinders. He found a few blankets
and two murderous-looking revolvers,
which were immediately appropriated and
sent to police headquarters.
The police, although keeping a watch
ful eye on the highbinders, do not antici
pate further trouble, and in all probability
the murder of Lee Ti is the last that will
startle Chinatown for several months to
come.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
ANNUAL STATE
MILITIA SHOOT.
The First Infantry Regi
ment, N. G. C, at the
Butts.
WAS A THIN BLUE LINE.
Difficulties of a Weekday Tar
get Practice for the
Companies.
LIEUTENANT TOBIN'S BIG BCOKE
Unsatisfactory Changes in Regard to
the Pointsâ No More Score
Averages.
It was a thin blue line of the First In
fantry Regiment of the Second Brigade,
N. G. C, that mustered for target practice
at Shell Mound shooting range Friday and
Saturday. Out of twelve companies not
more than 25 per cent of the officers and
men reported for practice, and of some of
the companies not more than 8 ana 10 per
cent appeared at the shooting-stands.
The recent order of the Governor mak
ing a weekday the time for the shooting
is considered by the men of the guard as a
hardship, as it is with difficulty they can
absent themselves from their various oc
cupations for that purpose.
"We are not desirous of using our Sun
days at target practice," said an officer
yesterday, "but the men can't get away
from their work. The consequences are
that only a few show up and what are we
going to do about it? Of course the com
pany officers hate to have such poor re
ports go in to the adjutant general and
the result is that they will try to have
their men shoot in twos or threes or
squads whenever they can get them to the
butts.
"Another drawback is thechanpe regard
ing the points. Heretofore a man by
attending the two shoots could, if be fell
down in the hrst, still have a chance in
the second to bring up his average and
win his medal on bars. But now, when
he loses at the first target practice, that
settles him for the year. So there is no
inducement for him to leave bis work to
shoot at the next meeting. I tell you, the
September target practice will be slimly
attended, and nobody can blame the men.
"I lost myself on this shoot and I'll not
be here again. We want Governor Budd
and the adjutant-general of tne State to
understand all this. The young men in
the militia have something else to do ex
cept wear their uniforms. Their em
ployers have something to say about ab
sences from the store, office or shop."
The shooting Friday and yesterday was
done under the direction of Lieutenant
lxjuis Berrere, inspector of rifle practice
and in the presence of Lieutenant-Colonel
Victor D. Dubois, Majors Charles Boxton,
Charles Tilden and Hugh Sime.

Water for the Veterans.
The Board of Directors of the Yountville
Veterans' Home Association met yester
day at their office on Sansome street for
the purpose of awarding the contract for
building a dam at the home.
Several bids were received ranging from
$23,322 to $4778, but the contract was
awarded to C. E. Urowley of San Fran
cisco, whose bid was close to $6000.
The plans prepared by Colonel William
C. Alberser, C.E., are for a rock-filled
dam forty feet high in the center and 260
feet lonr on the horizontal top measure
ment. Tne dam will hold about 8,000,000
gallons.
It will be situated in a canyon on the
hills above the home and about half a
mile distant from the buildings. The ele
vation affords a considerable fall, which
will give great pressure to the water and
thus assure very efficient protection
against fire.
The water supply, it has been estimated,
will be ample to irrigate the grounds,
furnish water for ail purposes to the insti
tution and maintain an abundant reserve
for use in ca^e of fire. According to the
terms of tbe contract the dam must be
ouilt ninety days after the contract is
signed. _
A CASE OF WATER.
The Supremo Court Reverses the De
cision in n Much-Vexed San
Diego Case.
T. J. Hifgins and W. Llewellyn, plain
tiffs and respondents, against the city of
San Diego, Gilbert Rennie as Auditor and
Nat Kennedy as Treasurer of sjiid city of
San Diego, the San Diego Water Com
pany, the San Diego Flume Company,
Bryant Howard. Charles S. Hamilton, A.
E. Horton and M. T. Gilmore defendants,
the San D.ego Water Company appellant.
Such is the title of an appealed case in
which the Supreme Court handed down a
decision yesterday, reversing the judg
ment of the lower tribunal. The appeal
represents another phase of the varied
litigation which has grown out of the con
tract between the San Diego Flume Com
pany and the San Diego Water Company.
The flume company has been bringing the
water to the city limits, where the water
company has been distributing it through
its pipes, being sole agent of the flume
company.
On the first of June, 1891, the water com
pany turned its plant over to the city of
Ban Diego under a contract which was in
form a lease from the water company to
Bryant Howard and four others and a
sub-lease by them to the city. Howard ]
and the others were expressly exempt
from liability of any nature and the lease
to them was to be void unless the sub-lease
to tne city were made. The lease, sub
lease and contract with the city were
therefore practically one transaction. In
September, 1892, the plaintiffs, Higgins
and Llewellyn, taxpayers of San Diego,
commenced an action for the annulment
of the lease and sub-lease and for an in
junction against t c Treasurer and Audi
tor of San Diego prohibiting them from
allowing and paying any claims arising
out of tne transaction. After the hearing
of much evidence pro and contra, the
Superior Court decided that the contract
was invalid, citing section 18, article XI
of the constitution and section 11, article
11, chapter 11, of the charter of San Diego.
As a matter of fact, the terms of the
sub-lease whereby the city was to pay a
monthly rental for the water works of
$9166 65 were drawu up for the purpose of
using the amount tbus secured is t. c con
struction of a railway. The Superior
Court held the contract void because the
city was led into subsidizing a railway un
der the gu.se oi paying rent, and because
the Mayor had not sufficient authority to
execute the contract on the part of the
city.
The Supreme Court sustained the view
that the express contract to pay $9166 65 a
month was invalid fur the reasons stnted,
but there was no reason why the city
should not pay a reasonable rental for the
water works. Hence, the judgment was
reversed and the cause remanded to tbe
Superior Court witn instructions to enter
judgment in favor of the water company
lor tbe value to the city of the use of the
company's plant during the time it was
actually retained by the city. The decision
is signed by Chief Justice Beatty and con
curred in by Justices McFariand, Hen
sbaw and Temple, Justice Harrison dis
senting.

THOUGHTFUL TRAVELERS.
Colonel W. D. Sanborn and Wife
Receive a Handsome
Present.
For His Courtesy to the Republican
Delegation to St Louis San
born Is Honorel
Colonel W. D. Sanborn, local agent of
the Burlington route, was made tbe re
cipient of a very handsome solid silver
salad set last evening by the Republican
delegates from California to St. Louis,
who went there in a special train under
Mr. Sanborn's charge.
The presentation ceremony took place
at the Sanborn residence, 1406 Buchanan
street, at 9 o'clock. Judge C. H. Garoutte
was chosen by his colleagues as the proper
person to make the presentation.
"I thoroughly appreciate the honor con
ferred upon me," he said, "and am happy
to state that I perform a very pleasurable
duty.
"The courtesies extended to the Califor
nia delegation were many, but to none do
we feel so largely indebted as to Colonel
Sanborn. May he and the partner of his
joys and sorrows ever treasure this small
token of the esteem in which he is held by
us for his kindness and gentlemanly char
acter."
Colonel Sanborn thanked the delegation
for their expression of gratitude and
friendship, and stated that he spoke for
both Mrs. Sanborn and himself when he
said the present would ever remain one
of their most cherished possessions.
The silver service was on exhibition
Friday evening in the rooms of the Union
League Club at the Palace Hotel. It con
sists of a large oval platter, twelve small
round plaies, twelve individual salad forks
and a large serving fork and spoon. Jpon
tbe platter is engraved: "Presented to
Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Sanborn by the Re
publican delegates to tbe St. Louis con
vention." The set rests in a lar^e case,
lined with white silk and covered with
pale yellow silk, embossed.

tne Leadership of John D.
Spreckels.
The James G. Blame Republican Club
met last night in the K. R. B. Hall. It
was evident from the number present that
the club will be one of the largest in San

factor in this coming campaign, as its
members are fully determined to elect the
I Republican nominees. It was formed
j aiter careful and mature consideration.
â¢ Its chairman is ex-Sheriff Thomas Des
mond. One hundred and seventeen men
have signed the roll.
Several short speeches were made by
members last night. The following reso
lutions were presented by J. W. Hudson,
and adopted:
Resolved, That we, the undersigned members
of the James U. Blame Republican Club, do
hereby pledge our support to the nominees of
the Republican party, Mr. McKinlev and Mr.
Uobart, respectively; and be it further
Resolved, That we respectfully request the
Republican municipal convention to nominate
men well known to tbe community and of
sterling integrity, and that said nominees be
seiected from the different classes that go to
make up the Republtcan party, as we deem
this course essential for the success of the
ticket; and be it further
Retolved, That we do hereby approve of the
leadership of J. I>. Spreckels.
The executive committee added two more
to its number, and elected J. W. Chretien
chairman.

SUPERVISOR KING
SHOWS WHAT HE IS
Disgraceful Scene at the
Presidio Athletic
Grounds.
FLOWERS OF SPEECH
Comes Off Second Best in a
Tussle With Secretary
Holbrook.
ONE BABBIT SACBLFICED.
A Feast of Fury and a Flood of Bi'.
1 ng?gate Make the Event of
More Interest.
"To with the Society for the Pre
yention of Cruelty to Animals."
Thus dfd Joe King, Supervisor, etc, re
lieve his discharged mind on Friday even
ing at the Presidio Athletic grounds.
"What kind of a bloomin' country is
this, anyhow?" grumbled Frank Stratton
all in a flutter. "In England or Australia
if a man wants to see a bit of coursing
nobody interferes with him."
In a small hutch two sickly-looking
rabbits cowered forlornly, while hopping
listlessly about was yet another long
earod little quadruped, who did not know
enough to look for the escape holes, but
kept near a knot of men, to whom he
seemed to appeal {or protection against a
securely-fastened fox terrier, who re
garded him with hungry eyes.
Among those present were: J. B. Leigh
ton, secretary of the Union-street Cable
Railway; J. J\ Kydd, superintendent Â«f
the same line; Air. Rockwell, mairager of
the grounds; and no less than twelve
officers of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, besides a score or
so of hang-dog looking individuals who
had come to see some "sport." Sport, in
deed, they saw, but of a sort far different
from that which they baa come to see.
"The long and short of it is, gentlemen,
ti at this thing must stop. 1 have author
ity to stop it, I have come here to stop it,
and stop it I will."
This was Mr. Holbrook's ultimatum ad
dressed to the men who had come to see
the cruel sport. The secretary of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals is usually so suave and urbane
that it seemed strange to see him with a
face that would cut tobacco, thundering
forth his commands in tones of uncom
promising imperiousness.
"When I arrived at the grounds,"
continned Mr. Hoi brook, "Stratton said
he would wait for Supervisor King be
fore answering me. At 3:30 King arrived,
in company with Harry Cohen,*known in
police circles as the 'Irish Jew,' a deputy
Sheriff, a dog and a man also with a dog.
" 'Let the rabbits out!' cried King to
Stratton.
" 'No you don't, 1 said I, 'I'm here to
stop this business.'
" 1 say I'll have the rabbits out/ was
King's rejoinder, and his face grew purple
with rage. 'Who are you, anybow? You
think you own the earth because you've
got a fat salary. To with you and
your society. We have a permit from the
Board of Supervisors, and isn't that
enougn?'
" 'The Supervisors have no right to per
mit anything forbidden by the law,' I
answered. â¢
" 'Well, I'd liie to know who makes
the laws?' shouted King in a veritable
tempest of passion.
" \Joe King and the Board of Super
visors," was Cohen's answer.
"I kept quiet," continued Mr. Hol
brook, "though the whole thing disgnsted
me beyond expression I had to send
away some of the officers, and at 5:30 Mr.
Hooper and I vrere the only representatives
of ihe society at the place. Then Stratton
said he always let the rabbits run at large
in the paddock during: the night, as if left
in the hutch the boys from the neighbor
hood would steal them. He opened the
door of the butch and as be did so the
man holding King's don let it go and the
dazed half starved rabbit was killed before
I could interfere.
"The fellow King made a most disgust
ing exhibition of himself during the
whole affair. His language I have not
pared to quote, but I doubt if a hoodlum
of the lowest class would use it. I hear
the man was some sort of a hotel-runner
before I c took to politics. Surely he has
nothing of the gentleman about him.
"What a burning shame and disgrace it
is that fellows of this strive should have
any voice in the government of a civilized
community !"
But Joe King is a real Supervisor, all
things to the contrary notwithstanding.
FETED BY HIS FRIEND.
Thomas Bailnerman Entertains
Frank McGlynn, the Bud
ding Thespian.
A Host of Guests Assemble to Bid
Adieu to the Weil-Known
Social Favorite.
If happiness consists in being wined and
dined, then Frank McGlynn must be a
happy man. For the past fortnight the
gifted "youtig aspirant for histrionic re
nown has been feted by his friends, whose
name is legion.
Thomas K. Rannerman, president of the
Balfe-Moore Club, of which Mr. McGlynn
is vice-president, knowing that his friend
was about to leave for the East to-morrow,
arranged to give him a farewell Â« supper
last night. The affair was called .informal,
and indeed so it was as far as studied cere
moniousnesa went; but certainly the toi
lettes of the ladies and the quality of the
entertainment far surpassed many of the
affairs which are pretentiously heralded
for weeks beforehand.
To be sure, there was no "programme,"
but sach guest was willing to contribute as
far as he could to the general enjoyment.
Mr. McGlynn .was of course in great re
quest, and among his selections were the
oft-attempted and seldom well rendered
reading, "Me ana Jim,' 1 and Carlo Pin
suti's graceful ballad, "Good-by, Sweet
heart.
David Manlloyd sang "The Holy City"
and Arthur Sullivan's "Distant Shore."
Miss Charlotte Jones gave a reading from
"Dr. Xavier," Miss Daisy Keane sang "On
Promise Me," and Messrs.; Costello, Hay,
Murphy, Woods and Jones sang and re
cited as though inspired. Miss Anna
Honey's singing of "The Last . Rose of
Summer" was particularly deserving ol
mention.
Between whiles, of course, there was
much conversation, the flashes of wit from
beauty's lips being as harmless as they
were sparkling. But . Mr. Bannerman
seemed to realize that people cannot talk
and sing half the night without : getting
hungry and thirsty. Remedies against
these two human needs were abundant and
of the most enticing* sort. There was no
"menu,'' but had there been it would nave
been too long for anybody to read. ,
Everything nice to eat and drink was
there in unstinted measure, aud : Mr. Ban
nerman cannot complain that his guests
did not do full justice to his genial hospi
tality..
After " supper an impromptu dance
brought the delightful affair to a close.
Among those present were the following
named:
Frank McGlynn, .Mr. and Mrs. John Spottis
wood. Rev. D. O. Crowley, Dr. R J. O'Connell,
Rev. P. J. Cumming, Mr. and Mrs. Paul B. Hay,

Cue Pension ioo Many.
Marshal Baldwin received information yes
terday that A. T. Cox, charged with defraud
ing the Government by drawing two pensions,
had been arrested at Stockton. Cox is an old
offender, the present charges, however, dating
back to May last. It is claimed that he mada
application for a peus'on and back pay in Oak
land, usiug his right name. Later he went to
San Jose, anti, under ihe name of Johnson
secured another pension, i-pecial Pension Ex
aminer J. H. Anthony was detailed on the case
and was jusi Ã¼bout to arresi the offender when
the story of Cox's shortcomings was published
in The Call. The fellow has since that time
managed to evade arresi until yesterday. Cox is
abouÂ» 60 years old. and managed to secure in
back pay on the two pensions $800. He was
brought to this city last night by a United
States Marshal aud lodged in the County JaiL

THE CONGRESSMAN
FROM THE FIFTH,
He Will Be Nominated in
This City on Next
Saturday.
AN INFORMAL DECISION.
The Republican Convention Will
Probably Be Held on
That Day.
LOCAL POPULISTS ALL WAIT.
They Will Say Litt c About the St.
Louis Convention Until Their
Leaders Return.
The Republican nominations for Con
gress and for Presidential electors in the
Fifth District will probably be made in
this City next Saturday afternoon.
The official call for the adjourned ses
sion of the Fifih District convention has
not yet been issued by the chairman,
James Alva Watt, but that gentleman has
informally decided on next Saturday as
the date for the convention, and expects
it to occur on that day.
Mr. Watt stated yesterday that he was
waiting only for a reply from Secretary D.
D. Bowman of Los Gatos, as to wnetheror
not tbat time would be satisfactory to the
Santa Clara delegates, some of whom have
already agreed on that day.
Whatever be the day decided on the
convention will be held within a few days
and it will soon be known who will carry
the Republican banner to victory in this
overwhelmingly Republican district, in
wnich a nomination is equivalent to an
election.
While quite a number of candidates are
in the tield the most active work in behalf
of the nomination is still being done by
County Clerk C. F. Curry ahd Congressman
Loud and their friends, both of whom
have many friends throughout the entire
district.
The convention promises to be a fully
attended and very interesting one. It
will comprise eighty-seven delegates, the
San Francisco portion of the district pos
sessing fifty-five delegates, San Mateo
County seven and Santa Clara twenty
five.
Although the convention is so near at
hand, tbere have not yet passed into the
political circle any figures as to the com
parative strength of any of the candi
dates, and the nomination yet remains an
open question and one that is as doubtful
as it was a month ago.
. The members of the party who are con
cerned with the affairs of the Fifth Dis
trict know, however, that a representative
Republican will be named and that me
revolt in the district against the ruinous
effects of the Wilson bill on its chief in
dustries and the nomination by Sam
Rainey and other boss and "push" in
| fluences of Joseph P. Kelly make Repub
, lican success as assured a thing in this
i district as it can be in any Congressional
| district in the United States this year.
The State Central Committee has fur
ther proclaimed Its location and its ac-
I tivity by stretching across New Mont
! gomery street, from the Palace to the
i G r and hotels, the usual silken flag bearing
a strip inscribed "Republican State Cen
tral Committee."
LOCAL POPULISTS.
They Discreetly Await Develop
ments and the Return of
Leaders.
The Populist County Committee held a
rather protracted session last night with
out once reverting in the proceedings to
the St. Lonis convention or to the State
and National affairs of the party.
Twenty-five members of the County
Committee were enrolled as a result of re
cent district' organization. Each Assembly
District is entitled to eight representatives
in the county organization and when it ia
complete it will number 144..
The appointment of Populist election
officers was tne most important business
that came before the local party. The
party has not been recognized at all in the
appointment of officers of precinct regis
tration, but it will have the naming of one
election officer in each precinct to serve at
the general election. The committee on
tnese appointments, consisting of Burnett
G. Haskell, CarietonH. Johnson and C.
A. Lewis, reported progress.
The leading local Populists who have
not gone to St. Louis are not ready to dis
cus freely the results of the St. Louis
convention. Tney await the return of
tneir leaders for one thing, and for an
other thing there is a vague fading that
some arrangements with the Demoorats
may be effected in this State regarding
Presidential electors and perhaps Con
gressmen and other things.
Carleton H. Johnson, Populist nominee
for Presidential Elector in the Fourth
District Â»nd chairman of the local execu
tive commute, was willing last night to
express himself as far as this:
"We are generally prepared to abide by
the decision of the National Convention.
Many of us who for years bore the burden
of the fight in building up the" party
favored an independent nomination, but
! we are inclined to follow the highest will
| of the party, though we are waiting until
| the return of our leaders who know the
situation belter than we do now.
"We will certainly gjo ahead and retain
an independent organization in this City,
for we have nothing in common with tha
Democracy in local affairs. We are locally
mainly interested in members of the Leg
islature and Board of Supervisors. What
we will do aDout the National ticket can
not be predicted until the California dele
gation returns."

sioner Booth-Tucker will perform the cere
mony that will entitle the ladies to use

A 6alvation Army is not a romantic
affair, it is just the reverse. There is no
immediate prospect for the happy couple
except that of depending upon the charity
of the community in which they are de
tailed to work. No salary is promised
until the expenses of the corps are paid.
No settled habitation is the young couple's
lot, and when they take the vow they re
nounce everything except their love for
each other and their fealty to God and the
army.
The marriage service does not contain
anything about "my worldly goods,"* be
cause Salvationists only own their clothes,
and any record of endowment from one to
the other would be useless. When they
leave the marriage altar they are like
Adam and Eve departing from Paradise,
and, as .Milton aptly expresses it, "The
world was all before them where to choose
their place of rest."
The weddings to-morrow are ol un
usual interest, as two of the parties are
staff officers. Staff Captain Willis and
Staff Captain Wise are two of the best
known officers on the Pacific Coast. Cap
tain Willis has been stationed in many
places, and has been promoted at various
times on account of faithful service. Miss
Wise is the daughter of a San Francisco
Baptist minister, and created muca in
terest some time ago when the and her
sister entered the army training home as
cadets. She is well known both in and
out of army circles. â¢
Ensign Campbell, who is to wed Ensign
Mathilda B. Lucas, has been all over the
coast as a charioteer and field officer. He
is the best musician in ihe army and is
the trainer and conductor of the famous
headquarters band. Miss Lucas is an ac
tive officer and is the daughter of a well
known Tacoma educator. Three years
ago her Bister, who was also an army
officer, married Captain Foster and both
are field officers.
The duai ceremony will be conducted
this afternoon at the Trestie Glen camp
meeting. It is considered somewhat of
an honor to be married by the National
commander, and there will be an enor
mous crowd at the glen, as tbe principals
have large circles of friends on both sides
of the bay.

Inwall Must Answer to the Court for
Hinting at Bribery to a
Juror.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 25.â District At
torney Snook had a transcript made to
day of the testimony of E. M. Lipka, who
accused Harry Inwall of trying to influence
him in the "gold bricfc" case. He then
consulted Judge Greene as to the manner
in which Inwall mi^iitbe reached.
The legal authorities differed, and it was
a question whether to hold him for con
tempt of court or for tampering with a
juror. Some authorities held that a
wouJd-be briber of a jury could not be held
unless the juror was actually serving in the
hearing of a case. It beeined feasible to
have a charge of contempt lie agaiusi one
who would deliberately attempt to influ
ence a talesman as to how he should act
in the performance of his duty when serv
ing as a juror.
District Attorney Snook and Deputy
Church were in consultation for tome
time, after which a complaint was filed
and a citation issued for Inwall to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court. The citation is made
returnable on Monday morning.

"Cohen was the first man to greet me,"
said Waters to-day, "and he was acting
as escort to three very attractive young
ladies. He does not grieve at all over the

tight, and so be thought it best to leave

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
VETERANS WILL
PURCHASE A PLAT,
Haywards' League Has
Taken Up the Matter
in Earnest.
MUCH HELP PROMISED.
It Is Believed That One Acre
for a Cemetery Should Ba
Donated.
PLANS ALREADY PREPARED.
Tbe Soldiers' Plat Will Be One cf
the Most Attractive on the
Coast.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 25. j
The old soldiers of the Castro Valley
District, comprising the Veterans' League
of Haywards, are determined to have a
soldiers' plat in which they can rest in
peace when their long battle is fought and
won.
The veterans state that they see no prob
ability of obtaining sufficient space in
Lone Tree Cemetery so they have deter
mined to purchase an acre in the vicinity
of the cemefery and exercise full control
over tneir own plat.
For the purDoae of raising sufficient
money to purchase their plat the Veterans'
League will arrange an entertainment for
which they will sell tickets. They have
already received substantial encourage
ment from other posts, and they anticipate
no trouble in raising the necessary money.
It is expected that every post in the de
partment will purchase a few tickets, and
in this way the plat will be secured.
"There is an element of humor in this
matter of obtaining a cemetery," said a
veteran to-day. "Here we are surrounded
by thousands of acres of land owned by
patriotic men, who declare that it does not
pay to cultivate it and who are not culti
vating one half of it, yet the old soldiers
have to do all sorts of things to get one
single acre. A little soldiers' plat nestling
at the ioot of those hills would be an orna
ment and an attraction and no one would
ever miss it from their estate. We are go
ing to have our cemetery and it will be one
of the prettiest soldiers' plats on the
coast."
George Oakes is working hard to secure
the plat. "I think some one ought to give
an acre of Jand to tbe veterans," he said.
"I do not think they should be required to
purchase a burial ground in a district
where land is so plentiful. It seems to me
that there should be a desire shown on the
part of some owner to settle the matter at
once and deed a piece of property to the
league. It would be a lasting monument
to the donor, and would earn the everlast
ing gratitude of tbe old soldiers.
"They have their plans drawn up and
have theirttag-pole ready to set up as soon
as the location is decided upon. It is
probable that some special rate might be
made With the Lone Tree Cemetery Asso
ciation if the league were to approach
that body, but the soldiers want to be ab
solutely free to dictate the rules that shall
govern their plat. Many of them have
expressed the idea that if The Caw. would
make known their wants they would Boon
get relief. The paper *oes all over our
valley and I believe tha: there are many

A SOLID GOLD MAN.
Rev. . Dr. Wendte Made- a Remark;
Which He Says' Hit* Been
â¢â¢â â 'â  .â¢ 'Misunderstood.
OAKLAND; Cal., July 25.â Rev. Dr.
Wendte's remarks published this morning
did not express that . gentleman's senti
ments., .
In explaining his position, Mr. /VVendte
said to-day: "The reporter in his other
wise excellent interview makes me say
that Unitarian congregations consist al
most uniformly of intelligent and
'wealthy' persons. The last statement is
far too flattering. The pcÂ« *ental of my
own church shows that we nave our full
share of poor but honest people. Again,
he makes me out a free silver advocate,
whereas I am an out-and-out gold stand
ard man, which in my bumble opinion is
the cause of financial safety and National
honor. - â¢â  â  "â¢.Â» â¢' â  ' â â¢â¢ -â¢â¢ . â¢
"What I did say, or meant to convey to
my questioner, was thai if the election
were to be held to-morrow the silver party
might triumph. But in the three months
to ensue blood will cool, facts begin to tell,
common-sense resume its wonted sway,
the conscience utter its protest instead of
a reckless defiance of the economic laws
and moral standarcs of civilized nations
the world over, the American people will
vote for an honest dollar and the con
scientious and full payment of all indi
vidual and National indebtedness.
"This is the creed of the Unitarian, who
has been well denned as 'a Christian who
believes in one God and 100 (not 53) cents
in the dollar." :-
It is interesting to note in this connec
tion that Colonel John P. Irish is a trustee
of Dr. Wendte's church. -

SHERRY IS SUSPICIOU S.
He Thinks IJU Father* Death Was Due
to Foul Play.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 25.â The funeral
of Michael L. Sherry was held at the
family residence tnis afternoon. Police
Officer John Sherry, a son of the deceased,
has found enough evidence, he thinks, to
justify suspicions of foul play. His
lather did not have an enemy, but a broken
shouider-blude, a bruised face and lower
limbs could not have happened, he said,
by simply falling into the water.
He conversed with Officer Powers at 3
o'clock Wednesday afternoon and if he
had drowned it is not probable that his
body would have been floating the next
morning. Officer Sherry will make a
thorough investigation.

be* held at the residence Monday morning
at 9 o'clock, after which requiem mass
will De held in tbe Church of the Immacu
late Conception.
The Siamese have such a superstitious
dislike of odd numbers that they studi

CAPTAIN BROWN
IS WRATHFUL
He Denies That He Favors
Anything but Pure
Athletics.
NO MORE PROFESSIONALS
Athletes Who Come to Berke
ley Must Be Good
Students.
SPRINTER BARNES TO RETURN.
No Side Inducements Off?red to
Athletes to Go to the State
University.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 25.â Everett
Brown, captain of the University of Cali
fornia track athletic team, is boiling with
rage at recent published reports insinu
ating that he has been using non-amateur
methods in securing and attempting to
secure athletic material for the State Uni
versity. In the statement referred to the
idea is given out that he, by his efforts to
induce men to come to Berkeley, has been
using professional tactics. Brown be
lieves that the person who is responsible
for the statement reflecting on his methods
took his ground from an interview pub-
Everett Brown. Captain of the University of California's Track Team.
lished in a recent issue of The Call, in
which it was said that the track captain
had been at work for the ereater part of
the vacation in the interests of track ath
letics.
"It is true," said Captain Brown to-day,
"that 1 have devoted much of my vaca
tion to booming athletics and encouraging
those who can do anything on the track,
and who purpose trying their mettle under
tue blue and gold. I have not talked with
or written to a solitary prospective student
with regard 10 athletics, who had not
already signified his intention of coming
to Berkeley. I have spent considerable
effort. 1 will frankly admit, showing pros
pective freshmen that they will make no
mistake in coming to Berkeley and clinch
ing them as to their purpose, but have
held myself aloof from offering any side
inducements that would in the slightest
degree tend to taint the purity of amateur
athletics.
"Ever since I have been connected with
athletics at Berkeley it has been my one
aim to see that no one competed in any
track or field event who could in any
sense be called a professional. I am
unalterably opposed to tt.e r>lan of getting
men to come to college simply because
they can sprint or jump or what-not, with
out regard to their class-room ability or
their capacity lor staying in college after
tbey have entered. Before now men have
entered under the guise of 'special' stu
dents or through the art school, whose
purpose in entering the university was to
get a chance to participate in some of the
athletic games.
"As captain of tbe Berkeley team, I shall
not tolerate such methods. What we want
is closer adherence to the principles of
pure amateur college athletics, as advo
cated by Casper Whitney and otner such
well-known lovers of the sport, for its
own sake. If we have only one track ath
lete in the University next year, he has
got to be an amateur in all the word im
plies before he can enter a tieid day under
our standard.
â¢â¢It has been the purpose of the leaders
of track athletics at Berkeley for the past
three or four years, especially, to bring
them to a higher level and to destroy even
the semblance of professionalism.
"At the last intercollegiate three men
were barred out from entering uuder the
blue and gold because they were reported
to be semi- professionals and because their
collegiate records were low. We want
only such men on the 'fieid as will suow a
willingness to develop themselves and at
tbe same time Keep up their ends in the
ciassroom.
"The experience of Berkeley prior to the
season of '94 with regard to tue choice of
baseball players has taught us a valuable
lesson. If I am rightly informed, there
were only three or four men on ttie U. C.
team that played Stanford in 1893 who
were legitimately registered, non-profes
sional players with good standing in the
university and taking full hours.
"I firmly believe that tbe very fact that
they were not 'pure athletes' had much
to do with turning the tide of defeat
against us and giving impetus to the
'hoodoo' that has been on us so lar as
intercollegiate baseball is concerned.
Since more care for tue rules of amateur
athletics have been observed, a change for
tbe better has taken place in our favor.
"Barnes, our sprinter, who has been out
for a year, will be back ajjain next term,
but I do not know whether he will run at
all. As ior the other new men to whom
We arc looking there are Cutter, the sprint
er, of Han Jacinto; Cheek of tbe Oakland
High School, an all-round athlete than
whom there is no better for his age oÂ»i the
coast; Broughton of Santa Barbara, Daw
son and Jenics of Oakland, Drumirt of San
Francisco and McNab of Santa Barbara,
all of whom have good material in them.
â¢'lt is possibi^that Humphreys will leave j
the stage and return to college! If so wet
will have another valuable addition. But
as for the idea that we have been trying
or want to get men to come here for ath
letics only there is not a grain of truth in
it. We shall not tolerate professionalism,
nor men who come to college to get on the
team and have their names put in the pa
per."
Firemen and Politic*.
BERKELEY. Cal., Ju!v 25.â The selec
tion of James Kenney as Fire Chief by the
various fire companies of the town has
stirred up a merry fight among local or
ganizations of tire-fighters and others in
terested in the candidates.
Two of the fire companies â the Posen |
and Peraita' companies â have announced ;
that they will not recognize Mr. Kennev
as Chief even if tbe Town Trustees should
appoint him. As the Trustees called upon
tbe firemen to name so rue one Mr. ken
ney's friends argue that the Trustees may
rightly be expected to confirm the action
of the convention which they themselves
caused to meet.
The Peraita Company, one of the revolt
| ing organizations, had a candidate of its
own for the position, having already pre
sented the name of its ioremao, D. J.
Keane, to the Town Trustees.
Charges? of politicut jobbery â that the
whole action of the firemen's convention
was dictated by a political ring â are in
circulation, and those who are opposed to
Mr. Kenney claim that some of the lire
companies that were given voice In the
convention are not tire companies at all,
but clubs organized to favor the successful
nominee. The recent trouble of the Colum
bia Company is brought forward, and as a
reason why its candidates should be re
jected, the Columbia Company was de
clared to have violated the "mile limit"
liquor law at an evening social in its fire
house. The charge was a subject of in
vestigation by the Town Trustees, but it
was finally dropped without action.
If the Town Trustees should oeciJe to
appoint Kenney it is thoueht that the
Peraita and Posen companies will refuse to
acknowledge him as Chief. The organiza
tions are purely voluntary and the Trus-
tees exercise no authority over them.
Their apoaratns is town property, how
ever, and tbe Trustees might take it from
them in the event of a refusal to recognize
Mr. Kenney.
It is claimed by the seceding com
panies that Kenny is not competent to
till the position. On the other hand Ken
ney's friends point to his record as a nre
tighter and his achievements in the re
cent biaze at the Acheson Hotel. Kenney
is declared to have turned out with his
company at evsry fire for many months,
whilu it is charged that Keam has failed
to appear more than once in the past
year.
Berkeley at the Exposition.
BERKELEY, Cal.. July 25.-J. H.
Witham, secretary of the Merchants' Pro

ing that steps be taken fora special Berke
ley display. It is proposed that a Berke
ley day be set aside to be devoted especial
ly to the exhibition of the college town.
The Board of Town Trustees will meet
as a Board of Equalization at the town
hall on Monday, August 10. Meetings
will be held every day until the first Mon

THE WORK OF A
CLEVER SWINDLER,
Health Department Is Wor
ried by His Pro
ceedings.
SELLS ALMSHOUSE JOBS
He Goes by the Name of Blood
and Has Been Very
Successful.
ONE KAN'S NABROW ESCAPE.
The Savings of a Lifetime Almost in
the Eager Clutch of the
Rogue.
The Health Department, and more par
ticularly the officials of the Almshouse,
would like very much to form the ac
quaintance of a young man named Blood,
who, during the two past weeks, has occa
sioned them more trouble than they care
to accept without a grumble. Dr. Conlan,
the physician of the institution, reported
the matter at the Health Office yesterday
and the police have been placed on the
track of the individual mentioned.
About ten days ago the telephone at the
Almshouse rang up and a voice said:
"Just ask Charleyâ Mr. Bloodâ to step
to the 'phone."
"Mr. Blood?" queried the clerk, "who is
be, an inmate?"
"Why no, of course not; he's the clerk
out there,'' answered the voice.
"I tii ink not," said the clerk; "this is
the clerk talking."
The person who wanted Blood would not
listen to any such explanation, however,
and thinking tbat he was dealing with a
crank, the clerk hung up his receiver.
A day or two later an individual who
said his name was Sullivan called on Su
perintendent Reddy and said:
"1 am the man for whom Mr. Blood ar
ranged a position, and am ready to go to
work."
"There is no one by that name here that
I know of," answered Mr. Revirty, and he
had a hard time convincing the disap
pointed office-seeker that he had been
mistaken.
Within two days half a dozen men
called to take positions as watchmen,
cooks or ambulance drivers, and an in
vestigation was begun to ascertain the
wherefore of the sudden influx of office
hunters.
It was discovered that Blood, as be in
variably called nimself, had been system
atically robbing credulous seekers for
work and had already secured several hun
dred dollars. His method of procedure
was to ascertain the name of some worthy
person with some littie means who was in
search of a position and introduce himself
as the clerk of the Almshouse in search of
the proper person to fill a position that
had recently been left vacant by the resig
nation of the previous incumbent.
After whetting the appetite of his vic
tim tie would casually remark that as
politics were boiling and the County Com
mittee was in need of funds the fortunate
man who could contribute $30 or $40 to
campaign expenses would be sure of get
ting the job. This argument seldom failed
to bring an offer of coin for campaign ex
penses, and Blood appears to have been
far from backward in accepting the money.
About a dozen men have been found
who contributed from $20 to $40 to Blood's
capital.
The swindler made his headquarters in
the saloon at the corner of McAllister and
Polk streets, and the proprietor of the
resort is more than sorry that, be did, for
he ran up a bill of $15 for drinks and de
parted without liquidating.
Blood is an ingenious rogue, and showed
persistence in the pursuit of the nimble
dollar that would have been commendable

had he used it in honest endeavors to raise
funds.
One of his victims was working for War
ren & Malley, the contractors, and while
He bit at Blood's bait and resigned his
position was unable to get his money
from his employers until their regular
payday. Blood went with the man to
Warren & Malley, and, impersonating an
attorney, threatened suit, with a great
deal of bluster, unless the money was paid
at once.
Rather than stand suit the firm broke
its own rule and paid over the thirty odd
dollars due, which Blood promptly
pocketed. His dupe has not seen him
since.
There is one man in San Francisco who
is congratulating himself on having es
caped Blood's clutches.
He is a friend of one of the men who
paid fora mythical appointment as driver
of the Almshouse ambulance. As h*s was
growing old and wanted a place where he
might pass his declining years he was try
ing to get into the Crocker Old People's
Home, but only had $1100 of the $1600 nec
essary for that purpose.
Blood heard of this money and told the
old fellow that through his political in
fluence he could obtain the entrance for
$1100. He had almost pursuaded his in
tended victim to give up the money when
the expose came and Blood made himself
scarce.
NEW CABINET OFFICER.
The Miners' Association Will Bring
This Matter Up at Its Next
Annual Convention.
As soon as J. H. Neff, president of the
Miners' Association, returns from Colfax
there will be held an executive meeting of
the association to arrange for the next
annual convention in this City.
"The two great propositions which will
be considered at that convention," said
Julian Sonntag yesterday, "are the
mineral land bill and the securing of a
Cabinet officer at Washington on mines.
We have had a sad experience with Land
Commissioner Lamoureaux which fully
justifies tbÂ« miners of the West in asking
for a practical man in the Cabinet who
will look after the miners' interest.
"Previous to the passage of the hydraulic
mining bill, the Miners' Association had
accomplished but little. The passage of
this bill means $5,000,000 more of an out
put of gold a year for our State. There
are 129 hydrau'ic mines now in operation,
and the United States Debris Commission
has recently granted three more permits,
making the total number 132.
"The mineral land bill is a purely pro
tective measure for the miners, and if
passed, will give to them miles of valuable
mineral land that now is termed agricul
tural. We nave every assurance in the
world that this bill will pass."
HIS IDEA OF SACRILEGE,
Jerry Toohy Complains to Judge
Hebbard of Divers Irrev
erent Cows.
The Neighbors Thought Toohy Was
Insane, bat Could Not Influence
the Court.
"It's sacrilege, your Honor," said Jerry
Toohy to Judge Hebbard on Friday. ' 'Th'
cows come in and eat the grass off the
graves, and that sacrilege, ain't it?"
Jerry was on tiial as to his sanity. He
has charge of the Jewish Cemetery and
was arrested at the instance of John
Pettit, who resides in the vicinity of that
burying-ground. Mr. Pettit came into
Judge Hebbard's court yesterday morning
backed up by about a dozen witnesses, all
prepared to swear Jerry into the asylum.
It seems that the custodian of the ceme
tery does not get along well with hia
neighbors. The neighbors own too many
cows. Under Jerry's fostering care the
grass on the graves of his charge grows
luxuriantly. Nowhere in the surround
ing district is such a pasture. Cows as
well as capitalists know a good thing
when they see it and the roving bovines
of Toohy's neighborhood overlook no op
portunity to browse on the excellent grass
that grows over the graves of Jerry's in
animate charges.
The constant incursions of the hungry
herd sorely try the not very equable tem
per of the luckless Jerry, and when he
finds a milk-producer trespassing be is not
particularly careful as to the manner in
which be drives it out of his bailiwick.
Neither is he cnoice in the language he
uses toward its owner. The consequence
of the frequent neighborhood rows was a
feud which culminated in Jerry's arrest as
an insane person.
Mr. Pettit, Mrs. M. Cooney and Mrs. M.
Illing told of Toohy's transports of race,
and Mrs. Somebody-or-other, repeated five
or six time;, would nave told the same
story had Judj:e Hebbard permitted it.
Instead he had the prisoner take the
stand.
Tooby told the Judge his troubles, wind
ing up by saving :
"And if you think I'm crazy, your
Honor, you can ask Joodge Barry. I was
a witness in his court all day Wednesday,
and he'll tell you whether I'm crazy or
not."
"I'm a hard-working man, sir, and I was
tending to business this morning when
they came and got me. You can see for
yourself that I wasn't at a picnic," and he
glanced dubiously at his clothing, which
certainly bore out his statement.
"The whole trouble's over the cows, air.
They do run over the graves and eat the
grass, and that's sacrilege, ain't it, your
Honor?"
"It is Jerry. You may go," said the
Judge.
And Jerry walked out, casting glances of
scorn at bis persecutors.

MAD VENGEANCE
WITH A RAZOR.
A Woman's Blind Rage
Leads to Gross Bru
tality.
CUT A HORSE'S THROAT.
Mrs. Mitchell's Maternal Instinct
Proves Stronger Than Her
Self-Control.
SHE SLASHED AT M'MTJLLEN.
Failing to Reach Him the Woman
Buries Her Razor in the Neck of
His Unfortunate Horse.
Last evening while Eighth street, near
Folsom, was thronged with spectators
assembled to view the bicycle parade a
lad named W. J. McMullen was exercising
a young bay mare belonging to E. V.
Sullivan of the stable 222 Ninth street.
MRS. MITCHELL CUTTING THE HORSE'S THROAT.
McMullen was in a light cart, to which
the horse was attached, and with him was
a little girl, Ethel .Peterson.
The young man, so the on-lookers say,
was driving at a pretty good pace, going
around the block bounded by Eighth,
Ninth, Folsom and Howard streets. On
Eighth street the wheels of his cart
knocked over a child, the six-year-old son
of Mr. and Mrs. Cbarlea Mitchell, who
dwell in Sweeney's alley.
The mother, Mrs. Mitchell, saw the
mishap, and must have had a razor
handy, for she suddenly made a dash for
young McMullen, the driver.
McMulleu evaded the weapon, but the
woman was not to be denied. With a cry
of rage she sprang at the poor animal
which was attached to the cart and made
a vicious lunge at its throat with the
razor. A fountain of blood followed the
keen blade as the withdrew it, and the
spectators gave a groan of horror as the
poor beast gasped and choked. The blood
came pouring out of the wound in tor
rents, and the man, anxious to get the
mare to shelter, drove her, weak and stag
gering, to the stable. The wounded ani
mal was so weak from loss of blood she
could scarcely stand when the stable was
reached, yet still the flow of blocd seemed
undiminisded.
All along the street there was a trail of
blood, and the floor of the stable was a
sight.
Dr. P. J. Creely, veterinary surgeon on
Golden Gate avenue, was snmmoned by
telephone, and stanching the flow of blocd
a- much as possible, managed to stitch
the wound. The cut, three inches long
and an incn deep, was a terrible incbion
for a woman to make with one swing of
the razor. It is presumed that when she
saw her child hurt tne maternal instinct
overcame all restraint and she bounded
forward to strike something, and so struck
the innocent beast in her rage.
Dr. Creely regarded the case as a most
remarkable exhibition of cruelty to a
horse, and said that steps would be taken
to have Mrs. Mitchell arrested by the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
The child was taken to the Receiving
Hospital by the father and mother and the
bruises on the wrist and head, which are
not serious, were there dressed.
Mrs. Sweeney, the woman in whose
honor the alley is named, speaks very well
of the Mitchells as tenants and neighbors.
WORKING FOR THE CARNIVAL.
Committees Busy With Preparations
for the Coming Event.
Favorable reports from the executive
committees of the Carnival of the Golden
Gate that are engaged in canvassing for
funds, are being daily received at head
quarters. While engaged in this work
the different members are ascertaining the
wishes of subscribers and others regarding
the date when the carnival should be held.
In this way they expect to be able to
arrange matters so as to please all inter
ested.
Carnival Director Fricdlander is hard at
work upon his plans of decoration for the
downtown streets, commencing at the
ferry and running north and south from
Market street. The main business streets,
such as Montgomery, Kearny, Grant
avenue, Stockton, Third, Fourth, and
streets similar in character, will be very
beautifully illuminated if Mr. Friec
lander's plans are adopted.
Two important awards will probably be
made by the executive committee Monday
afternoon. Bids for the official programme
will be received by a committee at head
quarters at 4 o'clock that afternoon, and
designs for the posters, for which a prize
of $25 has been offered, will also be re
ceived. _

PUGILISTS IN TRAINING.
vorbett May Jngage Jeffries to Spar
With Himâ Olympic Fisticuffs.
Jeffries, the aspirant for heavy-weight
honors, has been taken under the wing of
Professor James J. Corbett. Last evening
Corbett held a short conference with the
champion of Los Angeles, and Jeffries was
given to understand that if he made a
good stand before any of the fairly clever
heavy-weights of the local fraternity Cor
bett would engage him as his sparring
partner.
It was agreed that Jeffries meet Billy
Smith, the Australian, in a short bout at
the entertainment which will be given
under the auspices of the Olympic Club on
the evening of the 31st inst., and if he
should perform to the satisfaction of the
champion he will be engaged as Corbett's
sparring partnerâ a distinction, by the
way, which Jeffries believes will be the
making of him from a pugilistic point of
view.
Corbett's intentions are to engage Jef
fries if he proves to be worthy of his at
tention, as a sparring partner, and it is
said that he will also engage Dal Hawk
ins, the feather-weight, whom he will
match to box any man of his weight in
the country.
The Olympic Club has made first-class
preparations for its entertainment, which
will be held at the club on Friday evening
next. The directors state tbat no reserve
seats will be held for either the members
or those who will purchase tickets for the
entertainment. Two thousand seats will
be erected and situated in such a manner
that tha occupant of each seat will have a
nrst-class view of the contest.
The motto of the club is "First come,
first served." Bob McArthur, who is
matched to box George Green four rounds,
is training for the bout at the Olympic
grounds. Green is at Glen Ellen, where
he is training under the heat of a midsum
mer sun.
Mahoney, who is matched to box Smith
eight rounds, ia training with Davis at
Sausalito. Van Buskirk is training at the
Olympic grounds, and Butler, who will
square in front of Rochet te, is exercising at
the Olympic grounds. The matches are
unquestionably good, and the lovers of
fistic sport esn^am ble on seeing a splendid
evening's fistic exhibition.
THE BOY AND THE BARREL
The Testimony Does Not Con
vince the Court of Watt's
Guilt.
There Seems to Be a Mistake in
Identityâ The Peddler's Alibi
Sustained.
After hearing a lot more evidence of a
confusing and unsatisfactory character in
the case of Georgie Walker and the barrel
in which he was said to have been placed,
Judge Joachimsen on Friday allowed the
defendant, Billy Watt, to go on his own
recognizance.
The Judge said there was positively no
evidence upon which Watt could be held.
He himself stated that lie had been away
on his wagon, peddling all day. William
Ford, his companion, corroborated this in
a measure on the stand yesterday. Mrs.
Watt testified that the barrel was in sight
from her kitchen-door all day, and there
was no sign of any such trouble as ex
plained of about it.
Mrs. Elisabeth Gilmore, a next-door
neighbor to the Walkers, testified that she
saw the boy immediately after he was sup
posed to have come out of the barrel.
There were no signs of blood about him
and they were charging quite another
party with having put him in the barrel.
Judge Joachimsen said he was reason
ably certain the boy had been put in the
barrel, but did not believe Watt did it
Mr. Walker said there were a number of
witnesses who saw Watt about the place
in the middle of the afternoon, at the
time he himself claimed to be away on his
wagon, but they refused to testify as they
did not wish to take part in the neighbor
hood row. The court said he must sub
pena the witnesses and make a case or he
would discharge the defendant. The case
was carried over to next Wednesday.
VERY IGNORANT CHINESE.
Don't Know There Wat a War With
Japan.
Gustav Melchers of Shanghai, China,
member of the big German mercantile and
commercial firm of Melchers & Co., with
headquarters in Bremen and local branches
in London, Shanghai and other commer
cial centeis, arrived at the Palace last
night from Germany, whither he started
last March on a visit to his parents.
His uncle is one of the directors of the
Lloyd Steamship Company, for which
Mr. Melchers is agent in the Orient.
Mr. Melchers says that the merchant
class among the Chinese is manifesting a
great spirit of business enterprise that
promises to rival tbat of the Japanese.
Many railroad* are being built. But he
says that the average Chinaman is in the
same old rut that his ancestors were in
centuries ago. Folly two-thirds of the
lower class Chinese throughout the whole
empire, Mr. Melchers asserts, do not
know that China has had a war with
Japan.
Steamship lines in the Orient maintain
by common agreement a standard rate for
passengers and freight. They now fear,
however, that they will have to reduce
their prices w ben the heavily subsidized
Japanese steamship companies shall begin
to compete for the China trade.
Mr. Melchers will leave here for Shang

TRAMPS DITCH
A FREIGHT TRAIN
Their Purpose Was Evi
dently to Wreck Pas
senger Coaches.
THREE MEN BADLY HURT
The Locomotive Turned a Som-
ersault Down a Steep
Embankment
BETWEEN SUNOL AND BILES,
A Train Was Maliciously Damaged
at the Same Point the Pre
vious Day-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 25. \
A freight train was derailed near Sunol
this afternoon and three men were serious
ly injured. The accident was the result
of an attempt to wreck the train, and is
supposed to be the work of tramps. The
wreck took place three miles west of Sunol.
The freight train was pulling up the grade,
which is very steep at the point, at a speed
not exceeding ten miles an hour. Brake
man T. F. Wright was on the engine with
Fireman Charles Hurd and Engineer John
Edwards when suddenly the engine flew
off the track turning completely around,
throwing the occupants fully fifty feet
from the wreck.
An examination was made of the track
immediately and it was found tbat a short
piece of rail about a foot long had been
placed upon end in such a way that the
flange of the wheel caught it and upset the
locomotive. At this point is a curve, and
it is somewhat elevated. The engine
plunged down the embankment hauling
three of the freight cars along with it.
Dr. Webster of Sunol was called and
cared for the injured. Division Superin
tendent A. D. Wilder was notified at the
pier and called Dr. Olmstead and started
a special train to meet the injured men.
They had been placed upon the caboose
of the wrecked tram and huiried toward
Oakland. On their arrival here the
Fabiola ambulance met the train and con
veyed the injured to the hospital, where
Drs. Olmstead and Meiggs dressed the
wounds. To-night the men are sleeping
quietly and pronounced entirely out of
danger, although they will be laid up for
some time.
The shock to the nervous system has
been greater than the physical injuries.
T. F. Wriaht, head brakeman, has sus
tained a compound fracture of the left leg
which runs into the knee.
Fireman Hurd, while not as seriously
injured as Wright, will be a cripple for
life. His hipbone was badly crushed,
which will result in a permanent injury.
John Edwarda, thÂ« engineer, met with
several bruises and severe scalp wounds.
The officials declare that the cause of
the wreck was an attempt to wreck train
No. 84, which was due, coming down the
hill only a few hours later. Had not the
freight come along the passenger train
might have oeen hurled down the em
bankment and hundreds of lives lost. The
officials claim that tramps are to blame for
the accident.
Only yesterday the air hose and train
were cut near this point, wnich has been
infested by tramps for some time past.
This was udoubtedly caused by tramps,
say the trainmen, In order that they might
get on while the train was stopped for re
pairs and ride.
The wrecking crew was dispatched to
the scene of the disaster at 3 o'clock this
afternoon and is still at work there to
night at a late hour.
They found the engine which had been
running east with its front end turned to
the west. The wrecked cars were first re
moved which took most of the time
to-night. The crew will work until their
task is finished, which will not be until
late to-morrow, if they manage to get the
locomotive up by that time. The track
was only slightly damaged and can be re
paired with very little trouble. But the
presence of the wrecking crew will inter
fere with the running of trains during
Sunday.
The men were aÂ« closely guarded to
night at Fabiola Hospital as used to be
tne case at the old Railroad Hospital
under Dr. Woolsey. No one could see the
patients and the nurses refused to carry a
message to the doctor, which is an entirely
new state of affairs at that popular insti
tution.
TO INDUCE IMMIGRATION.
Manager Filcher or the State Board of
Trade Gathering Data.
Manager Filcher of the State Board of
Trade is having copies of the following
letter forwarded to the editors of the lead
ing newspapers of nearly every town in
the State of California with a view to
furnishing reliable data to Easterners who
are inclined toward making this State
their residence or place of investment:
My Dear Sir: I am convinced that people
are being diverted from California who other
wise would come, because of the impression
that Dievails almost universally throughout
the Eaat that lauds are so high here that a man
of moderate means cannot very well get a foot
hold. Many people of the East and Middle West
who are disposed to change their location are
induced to go to the Southern States, where it
is represented to them that land can be had
at very low rates and on easy terms. The im
pressions regarding nigh prices of land in
California have been created by conditions
that prevailed here a few years ago, but which
are not true to-day.
In justice to our State the people of the East
and of the world should know the truth, and
to this end we desire information from all
parts of California from which can be com
piled a summary of the situation regarding
the terms and opportunities for obtaining
land here to-day. I would be glad therefore if
you will prepare an article for your paper set
ting forth specifically the situation in your lo
cality, stating the kind of land, what it in
capable of producing and at wnat price and
on what terms the land you describe can be
had.
Tne article will be effective In the first place
in disseminating information abroad on this
important matter regarding your section of
the State, and then if you will send us a copy
of the same, cut out and mailed in an envelope
so that it will not be overlooked, we will use
it in making up a summary of the situation in
California.
Trusting that I have made this matter clear,
and that you will act upon the suggestion, I
remain, very truly yours,

Creditors and Are Inclined to

A. Quade & Co., the wholesale grocers
at 636 Market street, have assigned for the
benefit of their creditors.
Their liabilities amount to $20,000, and a
number of wholesale grocery firms in this
City are the principal creditors. The
assets, it is said, are much in excess of the
liabilities.
The assignment was made very quietly
on Friday morning to the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank. An agent of the bank was
in the store all day Friday and yesterday,
but the doors were kept open and business
went on without apparent change.
The Board of Trade will meet at 10:30
o'clock to-morrow forenoon to take action.
An extension of time will be asked for and
will probably be granted to the unhappy
firrL.
"Ob, I had hoped there would be no
notoriety," said the veteran grocer and
president of the corporation when seen
yesterday. "For the last three nights I
have not slept. I cannot sleep. My old
friends have come to me and told me not
to worry. But what can a man do when
he has grown up in the Community and the
business and is forced to this?
"It was just the inability to collect what
others owe us. I have never known such
a season for collections. So, on the advice
of our attorney, we decided to make an
assignment. We did it to avoid a demand
by small firms. The big dealers would
have waited. They have Known me too
long. They have come to me since and
have been very kind and considerate.
"A friend came to me and offered to
lend me several thousands if I wanted to
make a cash payment. But all we want
is an extension of time and we can settle
everything.
"This is a corporation. 1 advanced it a
good deal of my own money lately during
the hard times. I could not have done
that if I had wanted to fail. That is what
worries meâ that people will think this
was planned. I have been in the grocery
business lor thirty years, and for the last
twelve years I have been in business for
myself." .

SAN FRANCISCO. SACRAMENTO.Tke Or\e Trolle\j~Gar
Without a Fervder
The guardless cars of the Market-street I
Railway Company are adding to their list
of victims right along and still the shock
ing fatalities do not seem to have the
least effect toward inducing the corpora
tion to adopt measures that will make its
cars less oi a standing menace to life and
limb. The accident of last week, wherein
John Figone, an Italian boy, was run
down and mangled to death by a Kearny
street electric-car, was only one of a score
of lessons of a like nature which, while
appalling to the public of San Francisco,
have been allowed to pass by practically
unheeded by the streetcar company's
officials. Fenders have been tried â dozens
of them â but the company is very hard to
be suited. It doesn't seem to be bidding
for any of the fenders now in existence,
although cities on this continent larger
than San Francisco have long been uÂ«ed
to the sight of life-saving guards on street
cars. The illustration below shows the
car which ground John Fieone to death.
The reports of the matter agree that the
board shell that serves as a "guard" on
the front of the car caught and held the
child's body until the wheels cut it almost
limb from limb.
Such a contrivance as that is not a safe
guard. It does not throw off a body, but
rather serves to make death surer for the
victim than if the board shelf were not
there at all. It crushes the victim into
unconsciousness before he reaches the
finishing grind of the wheels.
It seems strange that San Francisco
streetcars should be run without safety
lenders, or with the barest excuses for
guards, when not only public safety de
mands them, but the interests of the cor
poration would be largely aided by the in
troduction of proper guards at the earliest
possible moment. It would save the com
pany many a heavy lawsuit if its own
selfish interests be taken into considera
tion ; but it would save lives, and for this
reason the authorities should take such
action as will necessitate compliance by
the streetcar company with tne demand
for safety-fenders.
In Philadelphia the newspaper illustra
tions bear witness to the common use of a
streetcar fender there which has some re
semblance to a proper guard.
"Look upon this picture, and on that,"
and observe that if young Figoue had been
ihrown in front of a car with a fender sucti
as that shown in the second picture he
might to-day be telling tne story of how
he escaped death. Philadelphia streetcars
are supplied v^ith guards that offer some
chance of escape in case of accidents; they
aie intended to avert fatalities. San Fran
THE pjHILADEIiJ'HI^ TROLLEY-GAR
! Cisco streetcars, as a rule almost, are pro
vided with so-cailed "guards" that cut off
the chances of escape, if anything, and
render death a certainty to the unfortu
nate individual whose fate throws him in
front of the flying fenderless thing of de
struction.
But we need not go to Philadelphia or
the East to find guarded cars. The City
of San Francisco is put to shame in that
matter by little munici .alities that lie
within the scope of her gaze.
Alameda, only a quarter of an hour dis
j tant and closely related to San Francisco j
in a social and business sense, has ample 1
fenders on her electric-cars. Alameda is j
only an infant of a town in comparison,
but her people and her streetcar company
seem to have comprehended tne idea that 1
contrivances lor the public convenience
should be freed as far as possible from the
character of death engines. There was
never any agitation in Alameda over the
question of streetcar fenders. Tne street
car company gave no cause for agitation,
for it started its line in reality as a benefit
to tne public, from whose patronage it
was to receive its reward, and it adopted
precautions at the beginning to minimize
the dangers of the swiftly flying car.
In San Francisco to be struck by an
eiectric-car means death almost inevitably.
In Alameda the streetcars are not Jueger
nauts. If a child runs in front of a mov
ing streetcar there it receives a rough
lesson, but it 'isn't mangled beyond recog
nition. It is shaken up by the fender, but
it is not necessarily maimed for life.
Alameda parents, whose children have
thus been snatched from a thrilling prox
imity to death's door, may bless the
providential car-fender for saving them
from the horror of having their child
brought home to them, only a bloody
heap, in the morgue wagon. If they lived
in San Franiscco the story would be dif
ferent, as the score of deaths before al
luded to give evidence.
Fenderless cars! It is almost unaccount
able that they should have been allowed
to run their barbarous, death-dealing
course here so long. There are a hundred
dangers in this City where there is one in
Alameda. San Francisco is a network of
streetcar lines, and dangers lurk at every
crossing. Parents who Kiss their children
good-by at the sound of the morning
school bell must feel nervous till the little
ones return, for the fenderless car has no
choice of victims; accidents sometimes
occur even when care is exercised, and
there is no telling what child will next be
slaughtered on the altar of neglect and
heartless inaction.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
THE KIND OF WOMEN
THAT MEN LIKE BEST
My lady spends days and dollars for the 1
whitening of her skin, the polisiiine of i
her nails and the fitting of her frock. In
triumph she exhibits the result in the
sight of him she desires to charm, and olt
and often sees him led captive by a
maiden with freckles and a snub
nose. The intelligence in her eye
and the pleasant charm of her voice
have made my lord blind to freckles or
features, Or my lady sees him appar
ently lost to the world in deep discussion
with a woman who, as far as the dictates
of fashion are concerned, is hopelessly old
fashioned. Faulty as her outside garb
may be, there are inner adornments that
balance thines to my lord. She knows
something and she knows how to tell it.
When I read â as a penance â long pages
in iragazine or newspaper about the toilet;
hnw, by half a day of hard manual labor,
we may make ourselves physically lovely
for the other half as long as we neither go
into the sunshine or face a wind; how the
nair may be tortured so that a wisp may
do duty for a mass; how to take sun
baths, moon baths, milk baths and baths
without end; how to live in a constant
stew in a laboratory of drugs and instru
ments of torture, I do not wonder society
women look worked to death all the time.
And then â those two words are a fearful
test â beside the most lovely manu
factured beauty, the result of ten years
of hard labor, stands a girl wbo has had
to work for her living, and has only leisure
enough to be clean in person, neat in
dress and progressive in ideas, whose eyes
shine clear and bright from a busy brain,
whose plain serge dress is strictly for use.
Which is sweeter, more wholesome,
more satisfying?
It is like putting side by side a lovely
satin rose from the milliner's and a sweet
wild rose from the woods, and seeing which
the bees will seek.
It is getting to be the fashion to dress
the inside as well as the outside, for the
same poor little reason it used to be proper
to be pretty and imbecile â men like it.
The stuff we hear about men preferring
siily women is only stuff.
Silly prettiness bores them dreadfully.
Men of culture and wealth in increasing
ratio are taking unto themselves wives
who are workers and thinkers, and more
and more society girls are realizing that
they must work themselves up to the
standard of the working girl or be left
behind. As they need not work for bread
they work for play, or "go in" for some
thing.
I do not envy the woman who has never
had to do a day's work. I pity her sin
cerely. She has missed the best of life.
What excuse can one have for living with
out work? She has lost all the independ
ence, the Belf-reliance, tne feeling of being
worth the space she occupies in the world,
that comes from eating the bread earned
by one's own hands or head. This does
not include the woman who has "only"
! kept house and raised a family of children.
i She has earned more than she has re
ceived.
I suppose there are men who Dave never
; worked, but I always forget to mention
; them, as well as to think of them.
The word man wems to imply
one who does something. There are
men, and then there are those other things
! that have exquisite bachelor apartments,
j give pink teas, and have their pretty pink
! nails manicured. They do not mix.
It takes a greater
expenditure of nerv
ous energy and tear
ing down of brain tis
sue to evolve a ball
dress which will
make a beauty out of
a plain girl than it
takes to balance a
year's books. And
every woman who
sees her can figure
out exactly how
much is dress and
how much is girl.
Men are growing wise
in that direction, too.
They know the dif
ference between a girl
who is pretty at 8 in
the morning and one
who is lovely at 8 in
the evening.
The girl who stands
the test and the one
envied by the gas
light beauty is the
one who can wear a
ten -dollar ready
made suit and round
hat month after
month and always
look dressed.
Dress yourself as
you will, wrap up and
bind down, drape,
fold and puff, but the
woman in the clothes
makes or mars the
whole.
There is a . lot of
cheap wit wasted
these days about
women in men's
clothes. I should
think those same
wise and keen-edged
giants would design
Tke pleasant Servsatiorvs of DroWr\ir\g
In the Bay of Gibraltar, in the midst of
a furious storm, I was upset out of a canoe
and picked up in an unconscious condi
tion. The experiences of those few
moments are fixed more vividly in my
memory than those of any other period of
my life. Upon striking the water I was
whirled about in a vortex that speedily,
through dizziness, robbed me of all my
wits. When the whirling ceased I found
myself choking and gasping for breath
that I could not get, say 3 a writer in the
Philadelphia Times.
The first feeling of abject terror must be
experienced to be realized. When one is
being overcome an almost unnatural phy
sical fear paralyzes the functions, cramps
the limbs and causes the mind to take on
abnormal conditions. This terror is the
worst agony of it allâ the choking sensa
tion when the water rushes down the
throat, the blood flooding to the brain as
if it would burst are nothing to the awful
dread of being consumed and overcome by
the monstrous element about you.
I was surrounded by boats and steamers
at anchor and when 1 rose upon the crest
of a tremendous wave these vessels
seemed to be at a great distance and as
large as mountain's. 1 remember getting
this view of them twice, then my vision
seemed to suddenly become introspective
some clothes that are better, and leave
their old ones for any woman foolish
enough to wear them. They are not per
fection by any means.
Woman's clothes are more agreeable to
the eye and offer greater advantages in
the way of concealing defects than do
those of her brother. It would be an ex
cellent object lesson if we were compelled
to wear male garments long enough to
display the pigeon-toes, knock knees and
bowed legs, which are the result of cen
turies of skirt?.
We like our skirts, the diversity of color
is dear to our hearts and we clinc to aoft
laces and shimmering silk. A crowd of
women, seated or standing, is a pleasanter
sight than a crowd of men. Our garments
are hard to manage, but we can do it, and
we do not sigh for the anxieties of trousers
that will bag at ths knees or to weartomb
stones, minus the inscription, over our
chests. We can even resist that most
lovely bit of masculine adornment, a silk
hat. Our clothes are growing plainer am*
a little more sensible year by year and we
are learning 10 adapt the dress to the oc
casion, that is all.
Bloomers are going out, you know.
You know it because the Sunday papers as
sure it is so, not because it is true. Society
has discarded them. Of course. There is
nothing flattering about bloomers; they
are regular searchlights. Society is not
going to exhibit its defects to the scorn of
the unwashed.
Last yetr bloomers were a fad. They
were worn because it was the thing, and
worn alike by the snowy lamb and black
sheep. This year both extremes of so
ciety have discarded them, the lower one
because the upper one did.
Society is not consistent, though. The
lowest of the loÂ«r wear skirts to-day even
as do those who float on the froth of exist
ence.
Those who wear bloomers now wear
them because they fit the occasion. Books
and piles of booKs may be written to
prove that skirts are not in the way on a
wheel, and still the skirts will clog and
impede, get on one side and crawl up.
For the one who wheels around the block
once or twice to show a natty suit a skirt
is good enough, but for the girl who rides
to go somewhere, and must do it side by
side with her brother whose limbs are
free, a skirt is a serious handicap.
Even in takine a long walk the extra
weight carried and the extra resistance
overcome by the wearer of skirts is equal
to half the labor, and in going up and
down hill and up and down stuirs they
add materially to the fatigue.
Half the diseases peculiar to our sex
might truly be labeled "skirt trouble."
But it spoils the form to make dresses
so the weight comes on the shoulders.
Let us have form by all means, by any
means. Let us form ourselves into
middie-aged women with drawn skinny
faces, hands like bird claws and a propen
sity for failing over in a faint.
But let us have form !
Who cares for an inch or two inches
more waist? If your friends love you for
your waist they are not worth wasting
your breath on. Probably no one gives
the matter a thought unless to wonder
why the tip of your nose gets red and why
you cannot walk without puffing.
The girl who has waists on her skirts
and doesn't wear a stiff corset has just as
many friends and they like her just as

and was taken up wholly with fantastic
scenes, in which strange people figured
among friends of childhood long since al
most forgotten. It was as if important I
events in ray life were being relived in a j
dream, a dream in which the body played
no part. When once the great fear and
choking sensation had passed a feeling
of perfect repose of body and peace of
mind possessed me. Although I had be
come helpless and was being buffeted
about by the waves, every mo
ment gliding farther and farther out
to sea, I was contented and free
from any unpleasant sensations; fairy
forms seemed to surround and beckon to
me; there was music as of vibrating winds
and rushing water, and I found myself in
the midst of flowery vales and quiet mead
ows, but I can well recall the placid indif
ference with which I looked upon these
things. I supposed that hours were pass
ing, but had wholly forgotten the fact that
I had fallen into the water. In this state,
no thought of havine a body came to me
at all, yet sensation was alive and I saw
with my eyes and heard with my ears,
with never a notion that I was under the
water and slowly dying for want of air. I
passed through scenes of dream pictures,
one after another, each, exquisite and
peaceful in the extreme, filled with soft
well as her squeezed and genteel sister.
Thinking too much of one's self and one' s
appearance engenders a selfishness and
a narrowness that more than undoes all
the good impression made by looks. I
have noticed that the plain girl, who has
accepted the fact that she is plain, and by
quiet, unobtrusive neatness has drawn
attention from her looks to herself, is
of ten considered pretty. And she is pretty.
But where did I leave my bloomers?
The girl who undei takes to drag a
heavy mass of cloth up a hill when she is
out climbing is both foolish and culpable.
That is one time when bloomers fit the oc
casion.
There is a girl on our street who wears
her gymnasium suit, blouse, trousers, cap
and all when she works among her flow
ers. She became tired of snapping off
plants with the sweep of her skirts.
I've laughed to see her run up and down
the steps. Every time she goes up force
of habit makes her clutch the bloomers at
the knee, and gome down she tries to hold
them up behind. Isn't a garden an ap
propriate place for bloomers?
I wouldn't have her wear them to an
evening reception any more than I would
have her brother wsar his sweater and
cap; but to hear, or rather to read the
comments, you might think that trousers
once put on could never be taken off.
The same pretty miss may be sensible in
bicycle suit in the morning and a vision
of girlish loveliness in white lace in the
evening. The light in hex eye and the
smile on her lip will be her o~n, too, and
the boy who sits beside her will find she
knows plenty to talk about.
The expression "well preserved" is a
horrid one. It sounds like a mummy.
The well-preserved woman is something
like a mummy, too. Under the cracks
made by years of powder, under the faded
hair with the life burned out of it.is an old
woman, older really than her years. The
very adornments draw attention to her
age, while we think the fresh-cheeked
motherly woman grows younger every
day. Save us from being well preserved.
Some day, when we take ourselves as
God made us, live for what we can do on
earth, cultivate the divine spark that is
alike in plain and beautiful, cease to
worry and to rage and learn to be entirely
selfless and all-charitable, we will all be
beautifulâ no matter what clothes we
wear. Olive Heyde>\
Last sight there was a sound of "Juba"
on the ferry-boat leaving the City at 6
o'clock for Oakland. A long-necked banjo,
shiny-rimmed and resonant, was picked,
whacked and thumped while the welkin
rang with that time- honored song about
"tapioca" which was once the fashion for
neero minstrelsy, and the lively accom
paniment evoked by a "thimble." The
singing was about average and the banjo
playing not much higher in the scale, but
"de juba" was immense. Sedate citizens
crinkled their faces up into corrugated
grins and showed sympathetic "ivories."
Mechanics crowded to the front with their
tin pails. Capitalists risked good clothes
and siiky tile hats Â»n the jam. "Br-r-r-r-r"
chortled the singer; chink, chink, chank
went the banjo.
The reason for ;' the popularity, of the
old-time negro minstrelsy was apparent to
any one. There were no songs in a dicky
bird voice : about "Mother's Old" or
HBHBHBHBHH'Tick the Flower Be
â fore It Withers"â
â nothing but rough,
â racy Africanism dia-
ect, movement,
Hhorselaugh,vigorand
â the subtle appeal
Hwhich good humor
â irresistibly makes to
â the ' wholesome and
Bhappy. There was a
Msong about "de old
â farm," but no one
â  wanted it. "Laugh,"
â said one. Back went
â  the black head, wide
â  open sprung the
â  mouth, and from it
â  came a laugh so free
â from care, responsi-
Bbility, amorousness
or conventionalism
that every auditor
smiled again and
again.
After all, however,
this was not a South
ern negro. He was
born in San Francis
co, and lives some
where on Kearny
street. His name is
William Jackson, and
he says that he
laughs because he
cannot help it, which
is also the reason he
gives for playing the
banjo and singing.
Jackson is a typi
negro minstrel, and
though he may ba a
little shy on philoso
phy he knows that
the world laughs
with him, and he
acts according to his
radiating lights of many colors, bnt all
presenting no meaning. The power of
thought did not seem to fabricate tangible
ideas.
Suddenly I heard a loud voice calling to
me, and it seemed to grate on the quiet
tenor of my consciousness and surround
ings. It was a voice with little music in
it, and as 1 really believe belonged to a dif
ferent world than the one into which I
bad been ushered by a watery path. Then
a peculiar experience took place. I felt as
if I was light as air, but carrying a heavy
load, of which I could not rid myself.
The voice, in which I could distinguish no
words, seemed to be associated and belong
to this burden. Other beings were help
ing me to carry it, and we struggled to
gether, though it seemed against all odds,
as I felt that what I was trying to carry at
each moment grew heavier and was slowly
but surely dragging me down. At last I
thought I had lost consciousness, but still
felt a miserable weight of dull pain in
every nerve, muscle and limb. Sick and
faint, I opened my eyes and found myself
aboard a coal barge. Then l recalled that
the burden I had been helping others to
carry was my own body. lam convinced
that with mental and spiritual powers I
had been combining with my rescuers to
save my earthly body from a watery grave.
Jtature of Disease
SkoWrx b\j Qesture
Any one can tell the nature of almost
any pain or disease by merely watching
the gesture with which a patient describes
it. Whenever any one is asked to tell
where he feels pain his gesture uncon
sciously describes not only its character
but its intensity and distribution.
A writer in a recent number of the
National Board of Health Magazine argues
that the pain gestures are always perfectly
descriptive. With a. little practice any
body can make a diagnosis with remark
able accuracy in this way.
Every one should be familiar with these
pain gestures. They enable one to detect
the real trouble even though the sufferer
may be entirely mistaken as to its cause
or its nature.
One of the most easily recognized of
thrse gestures is the one used to indicate
i pains of any kind in the chest. It is no
ticeable that when, for instancs, the pain
is widely distributed over the whole chest
the patient locates it with a circular rub
bing motion of the palm of the hand.
This gesture always means that there is
a diffused soreness. But if the pain comes
from serious inflammation it is always de
scribed by first drawing the hand away
from the body, and then, with the fineers
closed together, or perhaps with the index
finger pointed out and the rest flexed, the
hand approaches the seat of inflammation
cautiously.
These various gestures may be classified
in such a way that they can be very easily
remembered. There is but one disease in
which the patient does not touch the skin
when asked to locate his trouble, and this
is appendicitis. Any one suffering from
this trouble simply holds the palm of the
hand over the diseased area when asked
where his trouble lies.
All these gestures can be explained on
purely scientific grounds, but the person
who knows them can detect disease almost
as well as the doctors by this curious short
cut.
The most familiar of all these gestures
are probably those used to describe the
various kinds of stomach pains. When a
person is suffering from a very violent ab
dominal pain which is not inflammatory
he indicates it by slapping himself vigor
ously across his stomach.
It often happens, however, that a much
more serious trouble is taken for an ordi
j nary, harmless stomachache. If a child,
! for instance, refers to a persistent pain of
this kind and does not show by gesture
thai there is any tenderness or pressure
there is probably some disease of the
spine.
In almost all diseases the gesture indi
cates pain in a more or less extended area.
THE .ALAMEDA TROLLEY-GAp
It is easy to remember that in contrast to
this any hip- joint disease will be referred
to as a point inside the knee.
Other diseases of the leg are indicated in
an entirely different manner. When one
suffers from an acute diffused pain in the
leg, which is due to inflammation, the
patient grasps the leg firmly. But if on
the other hand it be a darting or lancinat
ing pain it wili be indicated with only one
finger.
It is very curious, besides, to find that
certain diseases are invariably denoted
with some one particular finger, and that
the patient never makes the mistake of
using another finger. The pain of
"shingles," or hepatic neuralgia, is al
ways indicated with the thumb.
A pain caused by the descent of renal
j calculi, or gall stones, is always pointed
I out with the top of the thumb or the in-
I dcx finger. The patient in this case fol
lows their course with his finger.
In contrast to this, any joint pains are
shown by a gesture in which the hand is
spread out and approaches the seat of the
pain very cautiously.
The degenerative pain of locomotor
ataxia is invariably described by grasping
the affected area firmly, indicating a hand
like pain. Any change in the nature of
this pain is also shown by unconscious
gesture. If the pain be sharp and light
ning-like in the leg the pain gesture is per
j fectly descriptive. It consists of an ener
i getic downward motion. At the same
time the band is twisted as though it were
manipulating a corkscrew.
A stiff neck is indicated silently by a
gentle pressure of the tips of the fingers,
the hand remaining meanwhile extended.
The hand is held in about the same posi
tion to indicate a sharp pain in the head,
except that in this ease the palm of the
hand is pressed against the temple. The
gesture denoting toothache also more or
less resembles these two. It consists in
placing the extended hand against the
i cheek with considerable pressure. A little
practice will make it very easy, however,
to distinguish between them.
A tender muscle is indicated by pinch
ing it gently with two fingers. A hip
bruise, on the other hand, is shown by a
pressure of the closed band. A pain in
the side due to inflammation or bruising
j is indicated by a pressure of the tips of the
j fingers, the hand being kept meanwhile
I rigidly extended.
The gesture for any pain in the heart
j also consists of a firm pressure, but in this
case only one finger is used. In pointing
out rheumatic pains in the shoulders the
hand is partly closed and the painful area
is pressed slightly with two of the fingers.

For artists with the brush and palette
the old town of Monterey ana its environ
ments have long possessed a fascination.
Men and women Who have won distinc
tion in the art centers of Europe turn a
longing gaze to the bay of Monterey.
Memory holds images of land and sea and
sky of surpassing beauty. The seasons of
California have been divided by the poet
into "half a year of clouds and flowers,
half a year of dust and sky," but the di
vision cannot be applied to Monterey in
the sense that is applicable to the foothill
regions. All the year round Monterey is
a delightful place. The flowers bloom al
ways.
At one time the artist colony at
Monterey represented many of the best
known painters of California. They lead
a life free from care and convention
ality, finding the conditions of tranquillity
and repose which frequently produce the
greatest pictures.
That Monterey is to have a renaissanceâ
a tew birth in artistic recognition â
is highly probable. Charles Rollo Peters,
who returned from Europe several months
ago and established a studio at Monterey,
speaks of the many artists abroad who are
talking of coming back to America for a
season of work, recreation and reflection
at the old capital of California.
Harrison, who has gained fame and suc
cess as an artist, recalls with delight his
outings in California nearly twenty years
ago, when Jules Tavernier, Denny, Ham
ilton, Paul Franzeny, Lizzie Strong, Virgil
Williams, Julian Rix, J. D. Strong, Yel
land, Holdridge and Nellie Kopps were
representatives of the art colony at Monte
rey. He told Peters that he would never
be entirely happy again until he was set
tled in a studio on the shores of the bay
of Monterey.
Lizzie Strong, whose talent has been
recognized in London and Paris, and
whose pictures are admitted to the salon,
never ceased to dream of the halcyon days
at Monterey, during her long sojourn
abroad. Her dearly cherished desire to
return and renew acquaintance with the
scenes so vividly impressed in her mind
has been gratified.
To her studio in the old town she will
bring her pictures. It is her purpose to
make another step and exhibit her entire
collection of paintings in the town. "Word
comes that other artists will follow the ex
ample of Mr. Peters and Miss Strong, and
settle down for a season of work and solace
in the old, familiar place.
It would not be strange if Thomas Hill,
the most sucessful of old California paint
ers, should not leave his summer abiding
place at Wawona to loiter iv the winter on
the beach at Monterey. Fred M. Yates,
now one of the celebrated portrait painters
of England, will be in California in a few
days. He is sure to bring news of other
artists coming home to the scene of their
early struggles and first triumphs. Should
it strike their fancy to hold a reunion at
Monterey, the convention of artists would
present some striking figures.
Juies Tavernier, Virgil Williams. Denny,
Julian Rix, Joseph Strong and others,
constituting what may be classed as the
early group of artists, painted old mis
sions, the colonies of fishermen, whales
and whalers, with an occasional study of
a senorita or a tempest-bruised cypress
Btanding on the outpost of the forest as a
sentinel to challenge the sea. It is pos
sible and much to be desired that the
painters of the renaissance should study
the historical phases of Monterey, and,
taking suggestions from the Historical
Society, tell us something on canvas of
the men who framed the constitution at
Colton Hall in 1849, how they passed their
time when the convention was not in ses-
Bion, and of the senoritas to whom they
paid their compliments.
With whom did these char ter-f ram ers
mingle? Where did they loiter in their
hours of leisure ? The historical societies of
New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
and Virginia have preserved in literature
and paintings the striking personalities
and scenes in the founding of their re
spective commonwealths, but the failure
of California in this respect is lamentable.
We know that the delegates assembled
Saturday, September 1, 1849, and ad
MIDNIGHT COUNCIL OF THE GIANTS
journed sine die Saturday afternoon, Oc
tober 13, 1849. It is obvious from reading
J. Ross Browne's reports of the debates
that all of Duke Gwln's tact was called
into play to avert a duel between Henry
A. Tefft of San liuis Obispo and J. M.
Jones of San Jonquin. Tefft, in referring
to Jones, suggested the quotation from
Junius: "There are men who never
aspire to hatred â who never rise above
contempt" Jones demanded that the
language be .taken down, saying: "lam
better acquainted with the duties of a gen
tleman than with the language of Junius."
Mr. Gwin as a peacemaker achieved
quite a triumph. The scene occurred early
in the convention and the settlement by
apologies in open session doubtless pre
vented many personal collisions. He
maintained with stubborn persistency that
there should be no after settlement out of
doors â no bloodshed resulting from what
had transpired.
In the Capitol building at Sacramento
there are no single portraits or groups of
the men who made the first constitution
of California. There should be in the old
families of this commonwealth many let
ters which would throw light on the social
side of life in Monterey at this particular
time. Old and half-forgotten paintings
might be brought out to illustrate many
of the scenes, the gayeties and character
istic features of life in the old Capitol,
wben the founders of the commonwealth
were discussing whether the eastern boun
dary line of the State should be the Rocky
Mountains or the Sierra Nevaua.
Perhaps some artist has painted the
picture of the delegates, after the adjourn
ment sine die, going to the house of Gene*
ral Riley, U. S. A., Governor of California,
MONTEREY'S PICTURESQUE FISHING VILLAGE, Painted by Every Artist Who Goes There
and Immortalized on Canvas Many Times
to pay their respects to that officer.
Everybody must have been happy that
i day, for indeed the veteran General Riley
j said, "Gentlemen, this is a prouder day !
I to me than that on which my soldiers
; cheered me on the field of Contreras." !
General Riley, according to the official !
records written down by J. Ross Browne, j
was interrupted by three cheers from the j
members as Governor of California and
three more "as a gallant soldier and :
| worthy of his country's glory."
An artist was a&ked the other day to ex- j
plain the charm which Monterey possessed
for members of his craft. He replied that
the natural scenery which the artists
most desire was available. There was the
sea for the marine painter, the woods and
the mountains gladdened the landscape
artist, and above all there was the color of
the past â not the dim old past of bygone
j centuries, but the past oi the closing
ninteenth century.
He and Tavernier, Strong and Stanton
painted panels for the Bohemian saloon in
the old town of Monterey. The keeper of
the place, no doubt, paid for these treas
ures in refreshments Berved across the
counter. The investment must have been
a good one, for many a tourist rested on the
jaunt from Del Monte to Pacific Grove to
see the pictures and listen to the story of
how the artists made life joyous at the res
taurant which the old Frenchman kept in !
the abandoned guardhouse or jail. Doubt
less Tavernier often paia for a week's
board by a cleverly executed sketch on the
wall of the restaurant.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
THE MOST UNGANNY SPOT ON EARTH
Weird Sigkts ar\d Sounds of the Superstition Mountains in
the JHeart of /\rizona.
The most uncanny spot on the face of
the earth is, very likely, within the bound
aries of the Superstition Mountains in
Arizona. The name was given this range
of volcanic rock by the Indians, and never
was name more appropriate. Of course,
tne educated man of to-day knows that all
of the strange and weird phenomena to be
seen there are the result of natural causes
and can be easily explained, but the poor
Indian who knows not these things can
hardly be blamed for having a wholesome
fear of any part of the range.
This range of mountains is located almost
in the geographical center of Arizona. It
is between the Salt and the Oila rivers,
and one of the spurs is within thirty miles
of the city of Florence. The mountains
are really a part of the Pimaand MaricoDa
Indian reservations, but even at this late
day it is impossible to get one of either
tribe to remain in the vicinity over night,
and only offers of big money can induce
them to go within tLo "cursed" precincts
during the daytime. '
And even after they have agreed to go
they cannot be depended upon to stay, be
cause they are likely to take to their heels
at the sight of something they don't un
derstand or when some mysterious sound
breaks, the mountain silence.
Not only are the Pimas and Maricopas
afraid of these mountains, but even the
fierce Apache shuns them. The legends
of the many tribes all refer to dire disaster
that has come upon men who have dared
enter the "abode of the devil." It is true
that even within the last few years many
Indians have gone into the Superstition
Mountains and never returned, and old
men say that no Indian ever returned who
scayed in the mountains over night. All
of which is easily possible, because the
poor superstitious wretches could have
been frightened to death, or perhaps in
their wild efforts to escape some mysteri
ous danger plunged down a precipice to
destruction.
It is useless to attempt to explain to the
Indians that all the strange things are
harmless. They have been told other
wise. Even the fact that white men go
into the depths of the range and return
safely after many days and nights makes
no difference. They don't really believe
the men have been there. How can a
white man go where an Indian cannot?
And have they not been told by their wise
A MOONLIGHT VIEW OF THE CAVERN OF GHOSTS
j men of a lake of fire that boils and bubbles
I and gives forth the sound of sweet music?
I All who hear it are charmed and rush
! gladly into the flames to be consumed.
The stories the Indians tell of the
Superstition Mountains would take
months to repeat, but the idea of all of
them ssems to be to impress the fact that
the Arch Fiend who presides over the do
main has a hatred of the redrnan, and is
constantly laying traps to destroy him.
All who enter the realms of horror do so
at the risk of never coming back, and all
who do come back have some new tale to
add to the already long list. The most
terrible things told of are the swinging
stones that turn out from the walls of a
canyon and crush the passer-by. Then
there are places where the ghosts dance;
j trees that reach out their branches and en
tangle all who come near them. There
are caverns filled with witches and devils
and awful birds that make the strangest
sounds. Wila animals by the thousands
come right out of the solid rocks.
Fishes with legs come from the lakes
and drown all within their reach. Fire
and smoke and Horrible groans and bowls
fill the air on all sides.
While many of the stories are purely
the work of the frightened story-teller,
others have considerable foundation. Any j
white man who trill visit ihe mountains
in the daytime will see many strange rock
formations, unexplainable springs that
throw off hot water, gas and oil. There
are fertile valleys surrounded by walls of !
mountains through which streams of cold j
water How. Flowers and grass grow here |
in profusion, and rabbits and other small
game exist by the thousands.
la the glare of the bright sunlight all of
these interesting things can be viewed un
concernedly, but under the pale, cold rays
of the moon it is another matter. At
such a time a person has to call up ail
his strength of nerve and only by the
greatest effort is it possible to make one's
self believe that the many things seen are
only senseless stone and harmless vapor.
In fact there is less real danger in the
Superstition Mountains than in any other
range in Arizona. To be sure, one runs a
risk in going into them, but to do the
same thing anywhere else would mean
certain death.
To really see the weird aspect of this
uncanny region it is best to select thÂ»t
time of the month when the moon is full.
The most interesting portion is in a canyon
that opens on the north side of the range,
and if an explorer will manage to get
about ten miles into this during the day
time and, after selecting a quiet spot, Wait
for the moon to rise, he can have an ex
perience he will never forget. But don't
go unless your nerves are strong.
The beauties of the sunset are enough to
j pay for the visit. As the orb of day de
clines the dome of burning copper that
I has hung over the land all day gradually
gives place to opalescent shades of emer
ald and amethyst. In the west the moun
, tain peaks will appear purple against a
| sky of liquid fire, and to the eastward will
j be illuminated with the afterglow of pink
I and crimson. Twilight is shore in the
j Superstition Mountains, and before one
I realizes it night has come â but not dark
-1 ness, for the full mocn sheds enough light
j to read a newspaper by.
CYPRESS POINT, MONTEREY COAST, a Favorite Sketching
Ground
In most parts of the world silence comes
with the nixht. Just the reverse seems to
be the case in the Superstition Mountains.
Or is this imagination? But suddenly tne
air is rent with the most unearthly shriek?
that ever fell on mortal ears. Again and
again it comes, and rolls and euhoe?
through the canyons, getting weirder and
weirder with each reverberation. The cry
is taken up on all sides until the moun
tains seem like pandemonium.
But nerve yourself and pass on. Keen
to the bottom of the canyon and you will
be in no danger of a fall. Silence will
come again, and if you keep on you will
soon see a cone-shaped mountain rising
before you. Approach closer and a cas
tle as perfect as any on the banks of the
Rhine will appear perched on its summit.
When near enough a soft, muffled sound
of footsteps wiil be heard. What is it? By
looking careiullya procession of panthers
can be seen walking around the cone
shaped mountain as if guarding the castle
on it s summit.
Round and round they go, looking
neither to right nor left, and though con
siderable noise is made they will not
notice it. Many old hunters say that it
is possible for a man to walk right across
the line and the panthers will not attack
him.
During the day it seemed as if the
mountains were devoid of animal life,
but now the air is filled with birds and
all sorts of creatures run here and there,
seemingly not the least disturbed by the
presence of a man. Every few minutes
that awful screech rends the air.
Further up the canyon are numerous
gulches, into which the moonlight falls.
j One of them has a sort of overhanging
ledge and beneath it appears a crowd of
men. Surely they are talking. For their
arms appear to move, their heads turn
from side to side. Some have on white
clothes and others appear to be of differ
ent colors. A peculiar sound like the
murmur of voices tills the air.
By climbing a small canyon to the left
the most startling sight in the mountain
can be seen. Surely it is not of this world.
The canyon suddenly terminates in a
gulch that crosses it from side to side. At
first sight it is only an abyss of inky black
| ness. Listen! A peculiar rumbling sound
, can be heard, and from the profound depth
! a white-robed figure will appear. Then
another and another, until there is a whole
procession of ghosts passing over the
brink. Many of them will wave their arms
as if beckoning the observer. While this
is going on, clouds will appear to float In
rom the sides, and perhaps thunder will
be heard In the distance. But the proces
sion moves on and passes up a canyon,
and finally disappears over a cliff. Silence
will follow, and the act will be repeated.
This canyon cannot be traversed further,
but by turning back and entering a small
valley on the other side three giants can
be seen in conference. They are sitting
close to a tree, and their attitudes show
them to be interested in what one of them
is saying.
Possibly at about this time you may be
surrounded by thousands pf rabbits and
walking right toward you there may ap
pear a gigantic bird.
Further up the canyonthereisalar.se
cliff, and behind it at intervals can be seen
flashes of light. Thunder follows and the
earth beneatn your feet will shake. Pos
sibly one of the flashes may throw you to
the ground, and you can hear the hissing
of serpents near by. If you happen to be
in the right place you can hear a grinding
sound and a rock on top a cliff wiil swing
outward. But it won't fall, as the next
shake viill swing it back.
Dozens of experiences like those just re
lated are likely to befall the night explorer
in the Superstition Mountains, so that
when daylight comes he will feel as if he
has been to the infernal regions or with
Alice in Wonderland.
More than $15,000 has already been con
tributed for the lleimholtz monument,
which is to be erected in front of the
University of Berlin.

Tourists who have just returned from
the Yosemite Valley report that there are
more visitors to the great natural wonder
this year than have ever been known
before. And they are going in ail sorts of
ways, but the greater number are "tramp
ine," and they are the ones who are having
thetest time.
Just how many tramping parties have
left San Francisco this season is a matter
past finding out. But they tave -been on
the roads constantly for the last two
months and there is no sign of a decrease
at present, although it is said the valley
does not look its best on account of the
scarcity of snow Jast winter.
The plan of these people who want to
have a good time on a moderate sum of
money is to form a congenial party of from
five to ten persons. But they must be all
good campers. The amount of money to
be spent lor the trip is then "pooled," each
putting in the same amount, and the un
derstanding being that they will stay out
as long as it lasts.
The next thing to do is to get a horse
and wagon and the necessary outfit. The
wagon is to carry the camp outfit and the
members of the party walk. So that all
may have a fair show turns are taken in
driving.
Many parties from this City travel all
the way on foot, going from hare south to
Niles and then up the canyon to Stockton.
But this is not general, as the road is un
interesting except while traveling through
the canyon. The trip to Niles is hot and
dusty and wben the eastern end of the
canyon is reached there is a long road to
Stockton, where the trip really begins.
The best and most popular way to go ia
to take the steamer at the foot of Clay
street and go to Stockton. By tuis method
the expense of the trip is increased very
slightly, which, however, is more than
compensated for by the additional time
thus gained to be spent in the valley or
some other interesting place. Horses and
wagon, as well as all camp out tit, can be
put on the boat without disturbing the ar
rangement of them, so that when Stock
ton is reached it is only necessary to drive
off the boat and proceed on the journey.
Providing the party has plenty of time
the trip can be made an ideal one. There
is no need to follow any particular road.
If desired the different mining towns in
Calaveras and Tuolumne counties can be
visited without going very far from the
direct road. The general direction of the
road from Stockton to the Yosemite is
south along tne western slope of the Sierra
Nevadas, and every foot of it will be found
interesting, no matter whether the party
travels close to the foothills or down the
center of the San Joaquin Valley. The
latter route will show the great industries
of California and the former some of the
best that the State can boast of in grand
sconery.
The pariies at present traveling down
the valley are very much alike. As to sex
they are about evenly divided, and a
more care-free people it would be hard to
find. Business has been ieft behind them,
and the young people are making the best
of the long holiday before returning to
desks, store or school. Usually there are
two tents, but in some cases there are
three. Almost as soon as day breaks
everybody is awake, and, Jong before
people in San Francisco think of getting
up, have had their breakfasts and pro
ceeded on their way. Travel is always
slow, and if there is anything to be seen
they have only to stop and see it and pro
ceed when they are ready.
Many of the parties of walkers to Yo
semite have covered twenty miles a day,
and most of the ladies have surprised
themselves at the amount of ground they
got over when they didn't even try. Most
of the parties, however, take ten days for
the trip from Stockton.
The stay in the Valley, Big Treea and at
Wawona and other points of interest can
be regulated to suit the party.
The homeward journey is frequently
made the same as the outward journey.
But the most common way is to drive to
Merced and finish by rail. People who
have made this trip are delighted with it,
particularly as it is fashionable this year
to walk to the Yosemite Valley.Some of the JKir\gs ar\ Idle JMar\ Fovmd ir\ tke Odd Comers of Sarv Frar\cisco

Why police Judge Gampbell Began
His Vacation With a Studvj
of the Dictionary
Police Judge Campbell announced from
the bench yesterday that he was desirous
of having all the business of his court
cleared up prior to the date of beginning
his vacation. He had hardly descended
Irom the judicial bench when a solemn
visaged friend approached him and
grasped his hand.
"Glad to hear that you are going away
for relaxation, Judge, "said the friend,
"but I want to warn you against the
sarcopbaga."
"Sarcophaga? What the deuce is that?"
"What; never heard of the sarcophaga?
Sarcophagus, which was originally a stone
coffin, supplied the name for the sarco
phagaâonly it has been Latinized."
"The dickens," said the jurist.
"Yes, indeed. Rightly named, too. You
know that this climate encourages noxious
life with the same fecundity that it gives
rise to fleas. On every scented breeze are
bacteria, pups and larvae in sickening pro
fusion. Tnat is, they are sickening to
any man not as robust as you are. By the
way, how are you feeling?"
The jurist said that he felt fairly.
"Perhaps you are all right then," broke
in the friend cheerily. "But to return to
the sarcophagus; no, sarcopbaga I should
have said. Not sarcophagus, eh, Judge?
Awkward mistake, that."
"No; not the sarcophagus, of course."
"Of course not. But the body of this
foe of man and beast, black and funereal
as his coat, is too suggestive for comfort.
A tracing would show the main lines of
the body to be shaped like a coffin lid. Ah,
yes; here you are; not a good drawing,
but still it shows a coffin with wings on it.
The wings belong to the sarcophaga, and
not to the sarcophagus."
There was something eerie in Judge
Campbell's eyes as he edged slowly away,
refusing to accept an invitation to take a
drink or a cigar, or to receive further
warmups. When his friend had gone
away the jurist sought out an elementary
work on entomology.
"Well, I'll be blessed," he said; "that is
a good joke, after all. The fellow was
talking all the time about a horsefly."
Tke UnknoWn
Winner of Jtaces
Throughout the season picnic parties
cross the bay from San Francisco and
make a day of it at Shell Mound Park, be
tween Oakland and Berkeley. Generally
a programme of exercises and athletic
sports is prepared in advance to furnish
entertainment and, incidentally, to furnish
a drawing card to provide for the necessary
expenses. Athletic sports are favored,
especially by the young, and not infre
quently by the humorously inclined of
riper age, who take part in fat men's
races, etc The boys come in for their
share of the fun. So it was that
on the occasion of the recent picnic
of the butchers there were two races for
boys, one being for boys under 10 years of
age and the other for boys under 16. The
first race, for under 10-year-olds, was
easily won by an unknown, a very little
fellow, who ran away from his competitors
like a deer. When the race for the older
boys came on the winner of the other
race started again. By his side lumbered
a tall boy, head and shoulders above him,
his agile legs spreading far apart like the
pointers of callipers and covering the
ground rapidly if heavily. The smaller
lad held his own very well ana came in a
close second. The larger boy was dis
qualified for some reason and the little
fellow therefore won again, taking an
other prize, a pair of tan-colored shoes.
Subsequently the same lad has won boxes
of candy, neckties and enough articles and
bric-a-brac to make him comparatively
wealthy. Still, he has worn his honors
meekly, having open an eye for the main
chance, and his discretion has permitted
him to avoid being disqualified. In re
ality the lad is between 14 and 15 years
old. Being undersized he looks not to be
over 10 years old at the outside. His
record has been loosed up by San Fran
cisco youths who have come into com
petition with him, and they discover that
the unknown has won races in school
competitions. His thin and wiry legs are
hard as steel and as nimble as a gnat's.
His body is light and withy and his
breathing apparatus would fit a racehorse.
His name is Henry Low, and he lives in
Oakland. _
HoW Ske Beats
Jke Gandy Stores
A San Francisco girl was seen to ente:
five candy-stores in succession recently.
At each store she purchased a nickel's
worth of chocolate creams. She frankly
told an acquaintance, who is possessed of
an inquiring turn of mind, why she did
this. She had in view the securing of the
largest amount of confectionery for two
bits. She had experimented, and had dis-
covered that where she purchased only 5
cents' worth the confectioner hardly
weighed the candy. He threw,
as a rale, a small handful into a
bag, with a pretense of weighing, but
really keeping little tally on the balances.
If the amount looked very small he was
liable to drop in two or three more choco
late creams. That made little difference
in one lot, but when three extra ones fell
into each of live bags the gross results of
ingenuity were encouraging. Borne skill-
j ful and expressive arching of pretty eye
brows, some scrutinizing or melting
glances, played their useful parts in each
separate instance, and a pert little twinkle
in both eyes betokened consciousness of a
winning and self-congratulation at native
shrewdness.
To verify the assertion that more choco
late creams could be secured on this plan
than by the ordinary way of putting down
a two-bit piece and asking for â¢ two-bits'
worth at .one place, the girl purchased a
lot with a quarter, and then adjourning
to another store, where confectionery is
not sold, a comparative test was made
with the use of balances. The tally was
in favor of the 5-cent plan decidedly.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
There were twelve more chocolates se
cured that way than in the more common
form of procedure.
"I am in no hurry," said the girl, further
explaining herselt "I see by going to
five places more than I could see in one.
I make more trade acquaintances that way
and I have more chocolate creams to
divide with my little brothers and sisters.
Besides that I am a student of economy, a
believer in the coming woman, and am
already figuring out the best project to
earn my own living, which I expect to do
soon."

Naturalists have long conceded the cat to be the cleanest animal living. That is as regards its own fur.
There are even cases on record of cats having bitten out a piece of their own flesh in order to get rid of an objec
tionable piece of tar or other tenacious substance. Bat there is a cat in Chinatown that discounts all of these,
for it not only keeps itself clean, but it keeps everything around it clean.
This cat has its home in the store of the Wo Yuen Company on Clay street, near Stockton. It is impossible
to teil just whom it belongs to, aÂ« the Chinese in tbe store will not answer the question. From all that can be
learned the cat is of a very valuable breed that is a native of China. In fact fit is said that it is of the same
family as the cats that are in the home of the Emperor and are used in the temples. What the Emperor
wants with cats or why they are used in the temples are matters of no importance to the story.
No matter what the ancestry of this cat may be it looks to a person not versed in feline genealogy like a
cross between a Maltese and a tortoiseshell with a good deal of just common ca t in the general mixture. But
be that as it may this animal has certainly acquired its habits of cleanliness from some other conditions of life
than its present one. There is a possibility that the owners keep it as a curiosity, seeing that it is the only real
clean thing about the place where it lives.
The Chinese in the Wo Yuen store are very proud of the cat, and even have a name for it. The cognomen,
however, is unprintable, as it sounds a good deal like a combination of the words "lung" and "tank," so in the
present case the cat will have to be known as "Tom," which, after all, is a good old-fashioned name that ougnt
to satisfy any cat.
As has already been mentioned, it is impossible to tell where Tom acquired his habits of cleanliness, but the
fact remains that he is clean. He is so particular that he will not even lie down without first taking a rag and
brushing off the spot where he intends to make his bed. And he brushes it good to be sure it is as it
should be.
Tom's star performance, however, is cleaning windows. In fact he makes a specialty of this, and the way he
does it is most commendable. His favorite resting-place is close to one of the show-windows in the front of the
store, and before he stretches himself out comfortably he makes sure that the window is clean.
It makes no matter whether the window is dirty or not, Tom always gives it a few rubs just for luck, possi*
bly. As soon as he makes up his mind to rest he reaches for a rag and dips it in a pan of water. Then he
commences to rub the window pane. And how he does rubl In a few moments the glass is like a diamond,
and he lies down to rest peacefully.
JKe JMortK Beack Bear Jkat LiVes or\ a Board
The animals of Meiggs wharf are about as important personages as the men who live in the vicinity and
there is no time when one of them is not playing the part of favorite. Sometimes it is a wonderful dog who
xnakea a specialty of killing crabs and at another it is a cat that swims out to ships and gets the papers for
the reporters of the Merchants' Exchange. Or it may be a monkey or a turtle. At one time it was an
armadillo. But no matter when one goes out that way there will always be a crowd around some creature
that is declared to have "more sense than a man."
At present a young bear belonging to W. Fitzgerald is holding the boards, and what that bear cannot do in
the way of tricks is not worth doing. At least, that is what the members of the crowd who spend hours of each
day watcbing its queer antics say. In fact, there are some of them who declare that the bear is capable of say
ing "yes" and "no." But there is no doubt of the fact that the creature shakes its head in the proper direc
tion to indicate whether it wants food or not.
Aside from the bear's smartness there is one fact that is sure to be interesting to students of natural his
tory and that is that the bear positively refuses to live anywhere else but on a board that was really put up for
it to exercise on.
The young bruin in question is about seven months old, nearly all of which time it has spent at its present
home, Mr. Fitzgerald having bought it when it was very young. As a cub the bear was a great favorite with
the crowd, but it was a long time before it had a name. It was such a versatile animal it was impossible to
find a cognomen that covered all its fine points. At present its name is declared to be "Jim," although a few
members of the crowd insist on calling it "Paffy." But Puffy or Jim it is all the same to the bear.
When Jim was first brought to his present home he was put out in a small yard fastened by a chain, but as
he showed a disposition to climb Mr. Fitzgerald had the contrivance already mentioned put up for him. The
board on the top was just what Jim had long been looking for, and he made up his mind to stay there. And
he has staid there in spite of all efforts to coax him down. The first three days he was up he went without
food, and would have done so longer had it not been put up to him. At present Jim eats, drinks and sleeps on
his perch and stays there all but a few moments each day. He even takes his exercise on the board, which is
not more than fifteen inches wide and three feet long. It looks dangerous to to see him walking around the edge,
but so far be has not fallen.

JI Case of Flunk
This Is Liable to Occur to EVery
Man Who Jfides Poorlvj irv
JRich Habiliments
Bicyclists make it a point to consider
the music concourse at Golden Gate Park
their rendezvous after a spin out to tne
cliff and, even when there is no music
there, the "bikers" may be seen reclining
by the dozens on the grassy slopes. All
the scorchers congregate with that bond
of sympathy which makes all wheelmen
and wheel women only "a little less than
kin." Clubs assemble there for runs.
When there is a concerted meeting of this
sort the novice who ventures into the con
course wobbling and unsteady on his
wheel at once becomes the butt of all the
experts. Fully one hundred wheelmen
and wbeelwomen were in view, giving
their silent steeds rest. Into view came a
most gorgeously attired wheelman. His
bike shone resplendent with nickel trim
mings and so on, and upon his bar were
female favors, a fluttering collection of
red, white and blue ribbons. The rider
was middle-aged and vain, and the expe
rienced eyes of the observers at once de
tected his inexperience. He wheeled over
to tbe side of tbe concourse commonly
frequented by wheeiwomen. They saw
fun ahead. Pretty soon the wheelmen be
gan to guy the new comer. "You're off 1"
they shouted.
"Why don't you scorch?"
"Where did you get them?"
The novice blushed, then got rattled and
fell offâ a case of clear blue flunk. While
he gathered himself up the welkin rang
with cheers and laughter. No poor rider
has any business to haunt the concourse if
be wishes to escape ridicule.
Jiis "Bloomers"
JKe fet of y\r\thor\vj Street and
the Fantastic Qarb He Wears
Six Days a Waek
A short street, one block long, runs be
tween Mission and Jessie streets. This is
known as Anthony street. It is not the
abode of the well-to-do. On one aide of
the street is a charitable institution, which
holds forth refuge to the poor and needy.
On the opposite side, "lodgings from 10 to
15 cents per night ' are advertised. True
it is that a few willow trees cast upon the
narrow sidewalK their grateful shade
and bright - colored geraniums try to
mimic the glow of real gardens as they
strike their roots into boxed soil and fur
niÂ«h evidence that poverty has not crushed
the love of the beautiful out of tbeir
owner. Among the human beings who
reside on Anthony street is "Bloomers."
The supposition might be natural that
"Bloomers" is a girl. He is, in truth, a
mulatto boy, gifted with white teeth, an
open countenance, love of fun and play
equal to a kitten and an appetite which
does not appreciate its own capacity. The
poor children of the neighborhood, quick
to detect peculiarities and apt in applying
epithet, fopnd the name of "Bloomers,"
which dame about naturally.
The mother of the family is a widow.
She has several children and "Bloomers"
is one of the smallest. There is no money
with whicb to buy clothes, and very little
to be devoted to the purchase of food, for
that matter. The clothing which "Bloom
ers" has worn Recently has been donated
or handed down by an older- member of
the family. Some of the donated clothing
seems to have been once a part of the ward
robe of the president of some 'fat men's
club." The trousers are capacious in girth
and opulent in leg capacity. The length
of leg only is changed for the mulatto boy.
Where tne scissors leave only as many
inches of trousers' leg as there are leg of
small boy, the little fellow, fairly envel
oped, seems to be shaped like a hitching
post fron: the ankles vp â the same size all
the way. That is why the boys, looking
at him, have called him "Bloomers."
That is all right among his cronies, but
the-outside-of-tbe-neighborhood boy who
says "Bloomers" must flee from Anthony
street or prepare to "scrap" in self-defense.

A drove of young pigs, numbering sev

made their way slowly across the foot of
Market street yesterday, en route for
Butchertown. Many commuters and over
land passengers were crossing East street.
on their way to the ferries at that hour
Even the most careless observer noticed
that each of the pigs bore a lateral stripe
eighteen inches to two feet long. Had
they been branded? There was no reason
for that. Still less could it be fancied that
the porkers had been striped for orna
mental purposes. The explanation was
speedily furnished. A stout fellow armed
with a blacksnake whip emerged from a
saloon and proceeded to accelerate the
speed of the drove by slashing right and
left with the blacksnake whip. Every
time the whip descended a shriek arose
from an innocent pie and a long stripe
marked the blow. Passers looked on
threateningly and remarked that the
driver would look well in stripes.

JKe Go-Eds and
". JKe Big Serpent
John W. Pack, assayer in the United
States Mint, when the duties and responsi
bilities of the day are over, retires to his
borne in Berkeley, where he refreshes his
mind and body with the pleasure of a bu
colic and peaceful existence. As an inci
dent be provides sustenance and care for a
black cow, which has, however, a few
white freckles freakily distributed over its
smooth and sleek coat of hair, in minute
spots. This freckled cow has a record as a
racer, made and sustained upon several
occasions when chance has permitted it to
break from moorings. Principally, how
ever, the animal is noteworthy by reason
of a recent adventure in which three co
eds who study in the State University
were involved.
It is a custom of cow owners to permit
their animals to graze over uufenced tracts,
and Assayer Park's cow enjoys this privi
lege with the rest. One day very lately
the three ec-eds alluded to in the foregoing
were climbing toward the hills upon which
a view of a large, varied and interesting
panorama is disclosed, the elevating effect
of which may be to refine equally with tbe
scholastic exercises conducted in the
State's institution of learning. The calm
and fragrant air was suddenly assailed by
one piercing scream, which was closely
followed up by two others, equally pierc
ing. No wonder, for crossing the path,
through the high grass, in horrid con
volutions and loops, sped a serpent of
indeterminate length, with great velocity
and uttering a hissing sound. At least
fifteen feet were in view, and the head and
tail of the dreadful object were concealed.
Tbe twilight added to the effect.
All at once, however, a stout male voice
was raised in protest. "Whoa," it said,
"whoa there, Pluto!"
The girls were angry at each other. The
serpent was only a half-concealed tether-
rope, which the cow was drawing after it
around the corner of a fence at railroad
speed. The cow was caught some blocks
away and the girls had time to recover
their composure before they retraced their
steps.
J^kotograpking and

As odd business partnership as ever
imagined or described by Charles Dictens
exists on Sacramento street, above Du
pont The parties to this business con
nection are a Chinese photographer and a
Japanese dentist. They jointly occupy
four small rooms on a second floor, which
may be described as tooth carpentry,
waiting-room, developing-room and gal
lery. The dentist helps the photographer
by complimenting them on their improved
appearance since their teeth have been
fixed and the artist tells his subjects
that they would look better with
store teeth. In addition to this the pho
tographer mallets in the filling to incisors
and bicuspids, and the dentist does an
occasional turn at photography. Their
patrons are Japanese and Chinese. The
two craftsmen appear to be growing rich,
as they ought to be, by reason of em

On .Market Street
JKe Self-Gor\scio\is Dignity of
Caucasian Finery on Mon
golian
At different times yesterday afternoon
there passed along Market street a China
man wearing a shiny "plug" hat and a
Chinese woman wearing a white chip
or straw hat, which was ornamented
gaudily with a flaring red ribbon.
Both were self-conscious to a degree.
The man carried his tile with the
jaunty air of a Chinese nabob intent
upon cutting a very wide swath and
coming as near as possible to getting
into the local "four hundred." The
woman with the chip hat seemed op
pressed with tbe Caucasian finery which
sat upon her shiny blnck coiffure, but she
was equally determined to be fin de siecle
and to keep up with the seasonable style,
and so she shuffled up the sheet with, the
airs of a martyr and a fashion guide
jointly carried. The glpbe-troiterwith his
helmet, the Eastern tourist with his mis
fit and altogether absurd sombrero, the
local sport with his striped. and vizored
cloth cap, in view of this odd Mongolian
freakage, were ineffectual. The crowd
looked at them coldly and superciliously,
il at all, for there were greater and more
original attractions in view, and second
class freaks had no show at all. Nothing
short of a cocked hat with snow white
plume would have been observed then.
Qorgeously Draped
Chinese Students
A part of the local passing show is the
spectacular departure of silken garmented
Chinese from the City's portals in large
parties. The passengers on tbe local fer
ries see them flutter by, gayly lined and
glistening as summer butterflies, the brisk
west wind distending their purple, pink,
sky-blue, maroon and other hued draperies,
and then they are gone. They may be
coolies; they may be merchants or mer
chants' sons. Whatever class claims them,
they put on their best attire in coming
before the public on gala occasions as de
votedly as the country New England
matron dons her "Sunday clothes" when
she expects company for tea. Of all the
Mongolian coteries known to have crossed
tbe bar lately en route for the
East, the gayest went away only a few
days since. There were thirty-two chil
dren, the youngest 10, and the oldest 14 to
15 years old. They were reputed to be the
I a IT , r Tii ' . I
sons of. merchants, who came to thÂ«
United States to be educated, and their
destination was New , York, where they
will be placed in charge of a Presbyterian
mission. The smallest boys were in front
of the procession, which marched on
board of the Piedmont two by two, and
they were so graduated that they ascended
like a flight of stairs to the two seniors
who brought up the rear, aglow with
enough Chinese finery to make a Fourth
of July pyrotechnic show seem pale by
comparison. There was nothing in their
faces to attract especial attention. Their
features were no more refined than
are those of the lads who are
customarily seen playing about China
town in this City and their eyes had not
the wide-awake expression of the boys
who have come in contact from childhood
witii Americans. Their faces were grave
and composed, without a smile, and the
owners seemed to be impressed with the
importance of dienity. Tourists and
globe-trotters looked at them and said
"How cute." They sat still on the boat
in their figured silks of many colors until
Oakland mole was reached. Then they
were marched gravely ashore in the same
order, the little fellows ahead, and de
parted eastward in care of a white man.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
MERRILY OVER THE

The Marine Yacht Club
Entertains Its Lady
Friends.
Society, Attired in Natty Yacht
ing Suits, Enjoys a
Sail.
The Jolly Hosts of the Dolphin Enter,
tain a Large Party at Their
. Ark Home.
Last Sunday was "ladies' day" with the Ma
rine Yacht Club, and the affair proved fully as
successful as the many former ones this organ
ization has given.
The weather was all the yachtsmen could
have desired and the cruise was inaugurated
with an initial run through the Golden Gate.
A splendid view was obtained of Fort Wlnfleld
â¬cott and the frowning but picturesque fortifi
cations on the adjoining bluffs. Fair Sutro
ville-by-the-Sea, with its inseparable Seal
Rocks, was also visited and admired.
On re-entering the bay, a number of yachts
being encountered, several races were indulged
in, which added not a little to the pleasure
and excitement of the sail.
During the racing the mysteries of reef,
tack and ceutcrboard were explained to the
guests, and the quickness many displayed in
catching the different nautical terms was the
cause for many a good-natured laugh at the
expense of the amateur saliors.
Anchor was dropped near San Quentln,
where the yachtsmen and their friends landed
and a dainty lunch was served under the able
supervision of Steward White. Immediately
following its completion a discharge from
the cannon on the flagship was the signal for
all to re-embark, the party shortly aftewnrd
sailing for home.
Every one had a good time, and it will long
be remembered as a day among days by those
who were present.
Among tho*e present were: Mr. and Mrs. D

number of friends yesterday at their ark home

Belvedere.
The day was delightful, and to add to the
pleasure of the merry party a picnic wa*
planned, in which the guests all Joined, and
wero soon on their way over the water to Bel
vedere Point. Here a delicious lunch was
spread beneath the llveoak trees.
One of the most enjoyable features of the
day's entertaiument was the excellent musi
cal programme rendered by the Dolphin quar
tet, luterspcrsed with elocutionary selections

DECEIVED.
His yacht salled.out in the morning breeze,
Like a dove with wings outspread,
And its pennant wai lou mid the bills of seas.
"Yet, again will he come," I said.
And I'm lingering here while the tide creeps in,
For he vowed he would come at eve ;
And he'll sail home bravely, my smiles to winâ
For my lover would ne'er deceive.
0, the wind and the wave give never a signâ
And I'm chilled with the cold sea spray;
"Will he come," I am saying, "this lover of
mine?"
And I shiver and watch and pray.

was partaken of and toasts drank to the
memories of tne gallant dead and to the suc
cess of the living. The Misses Brady sang
war-time melodies and played patriotio selec

NEW YORK, N". V.. July 21, 1896.â 1n
my first letter to The Call from this part
of tbe country I took occasion to refer at
length to the potency of the word Cali
fornia when used in business circles and
in trade. I dwelt at that time upon the
frequency of its application with refer
ence to various special products, but find
since tbat time that the prestige of the
State's name is broader still.
I make this statement after considerable
investigation, and a rather well-defined
inclination to say good things of the
Golden West in nowise governs roy ex
pressions.
I was at first attracted by the names of
California fruit-growers on boxes shipped
from tbat State. All aion,' the docks and
shipping stations of the many railroads
leading into this city I saw piles upon
piles of fruit crates branded with some
familiar valley or farm or vineyard that I
knew to be part of California.
Inquiry leads to the information that
the best fruit, the healthiest and most >al
able is now arriving daily in New York
from that point. Tradesmen, wholesalers
and retailers freely admit that every pound
of it is immediately snapped up by buyers,
and the arrival of every shipment is
looked for anxiously. Peaches, plums,
pears, apricots, lemons, oranges, limes,
and all kinds of fruit for which California
is famous, have within the last few years
almost entirely taken the place of fruits
shipped from other States. A wholesaler
gaid to me no later than yesterday: "I
guess I will have to go to your State and
see what you nave got out there. It
must be nothing but a stretch of farms,
orchards and vineyards bearing fruits,
cereals, milK and honey. The best we
have in the country seems to be coming
from there all the year around, and we
can get about what we want from California
when other sources fail. I have always
pictured in my mind's eye a magnificent
garden when the name of California is
spoken. Your shipments are clean, well
developed and so remarkably free from
disease and affections of all kinds that it
is a source of wonder to me. Of all the
States with which I deal through agents
and directly, California is the most re
liable for regularity of shipment and
quality of its output."
I could quote at least a dozen such in
terviews entirely unsolicited and given to
me simply on the statement that I am a
denizen of that section of the United
States.
No one is better equipped to take ad
vantage of this great regard for California
products than tbe Californian himself.
An instance in point came to my notice
on Columbus avenue. A broad black and
gold sign reading, "California Trading
Company," confronted me as I was stroll
ing along. Dropping in I found M. A.
Sanders of Los Angeles at the helm of
trade, while H. Chamberlain, formerly of
San Francisco, was in charge of the Cali
fornia branch. At least half of the store
was taken up by California products ar
ranged so as to attract the immediate at
tention of the purchaser.
"We do that," said Mr. Chamberlain,
"for the simple reason that the goods sell.
We opened tnia store out here in the fash
ionable quarter of the city on an experi
ment last January and have met with a
most remarkable success. We have made
a specialty of olives, high-class wines,
canned fruits, honey and olive oil. \Ve
ship direct from home barrels of olives
and put them np here in fancy bottles.
They can be found on the tables of tbe
best families in New York, while the oiJ is
now taken in preference to most other
olive oil produced here or abroad. When
we first opened with our plan ot pushing
California goods we met with some oppo
sition, owing to the novelty of devoting so
much space to one State, but a single trial
did the work. At the present time we are
not only supplying an immense family
trade but other grocery-stores are sending
in to us every day for something in our
California line. Tbe favor is spreading all
over this part of New York, and I venture
to say that before long we can give our
attention to that one State alone and
build up a very heavy business.
"A very particular feature is our honey.
Wnen we opened F. H. Leggett & Co.,
one of the largest packing- bouses in New
York State, sold us a considerable quantity
of New York honey put up in bottles, but
inside of a few weeks the wax precipi
tated and half filled the jars containing it.
Shortly after that we put out the Califor
nia honey, and it is as clear and rich to
day as when it was put up. We showed
our honey to Leggett' 3 agent and the rirm
since that time has ordered California
honey in bulk and is selling it in vast
quantities to-day in preference to the New
York material. They have put in big
orders for the coming crop, and in a few
years I expect to see California honey lead
the world for quality, clearness and flavor.
"I think the establishment of a
big aupply house, dealing oniy in
California products, in New York,
would do a most tremendous busi
ness, and would have a tendency
to brine the East and West together. Irom
a mercantiie standpoint, more substan
tially than any other form of contact.
We have tried it and made a success, and
have only experimented in one part of ths
city."
This instance is but one of many.
Jviuardo Cucuel, a San Francisco boy
who has been studying art in Paris, has
returned to this country, and is in New
York at the present time residing at 57
F.a-t Eleventh street. He tells many in
teresting stories of an artist's life in the
French capital, whither, after a visit home
and a trip or two to different parts of
America, he expects to return. Young
Cucuel was a passenger of the steamer St.
Louis when she beat the Campania in her
trans-Atlantic trip. In describing that
race he says: "There wa: but five tons of
cool left in her bunkers when she entered
New York harbor, and it is generally ex
pected that there will be something over
100 under ordinary circumstances. It was
nip ano tuck from the day the steamers
leit Liverpool, and the passengers were
wiid with excitement, some of them stay
ing up at night to watch the ocean grey
boands struggling for supremacy. The
stokers were beine rewarded and stirnu- |
lated with grog until they were entirely >
overcome by the liberal doses served out
to them. When a man would become in
capacitated from an oversupply he would
reel away to his bunk howling and cheer
ing for the American craft, while a ireeh
and sober man took his place. The watch
ways looking down into tbe furnace-room
were crowded with passenger.*, and the
band was playing National airs with a
vehemence that nearly undid tlie instru
ments. At n.ght the pounding of the
twin screws and the throbbing of the pow
erful engines shook t!:e ship from prow to
stem, and jolted up all hands pretty se
verely." Cucuel made a great many
sketches of the scenes along the trip.
General W. H. H. Hart of San Francisco
is at the Murray Hill Hotel, and, in com
pany with Colonel H. I. Kowaisky, is pre
paring to float what the colonel says is
the most gi.-antic electrical scheme ever
presented in America. They have been
up to Washington arranging the patents,
and after returning to San Francisco next
week, where the inventor lives, they will
once again come on to New York and in
corporate with a large capital stock. Fritz
Hinckley of San Francisco is one of the
directors of tbe new venture, and a great
big surprise is promised by the principals, j
Just what the nature of the scheme is no ;
one seems to be able to say, but I have j
Mr. Kowaisky's word that it is better than
anything Colonel Sellers ever dreamed of.
General H. O. Willey, ex-Surveyor-Gen
eral of California, is at the Imperial with
John McKee Jr. of the Tallant Bank, San
Francisco. They are here in the interests
I of some bond floating proposition, and
I will return to San Francisco after taking
j in a few of the Southern States.
Mrs. Clara Foltz departed for Long
Branch last Thursday to enjoy a short
vacation at that famous resort.
Mrs. William E. Dargie and her son
depart for San Francisco Tuesday next to
enjoy the California summer and to escape
â  the frightful humidity of New York.
Pete Dunne, one of the best-looking men
! who ever came out of San Francisco,
arrived here in the early part of the week
and is registered at the Gilsey House. One
of Pete's pastimes is to sally forth along
the Rialto and up Broadway in search of
Californians, who after being discovered
are treated with due recognition and Cali
fornia liberality by Mr. Dunne.
Mr. and Mrs. P. V. Mighels have returned
from their honeymoon and are now com
fortably settled at 200 West Eighty-ninth
street.
One hears a great deal among Lawn
Tennis Association members of the Cali
fornia players. They want to know
whether or not the Hardy brothers or
or De Long intend to come into the inter
state games at Narragansett August 10.
They regard some of the Californians as
first-class men.
The proposed St. George Club in San
Francisco is attracting the attention of
club men of this city. Those of them
who have visited the Bay City speak of
the very enjoyable times had at the hands
of Pacific Coast club men. The traditional
generosity and courtesy of San Francis
cane to Eastern visitors is not unfrequently
referred to by Easterners as the standard.
Pacific Ocean bathing resorts should be
; appreciated by those who are able to en-
I joy them. Here in New York, all around
! Long Island ttiere is a garbage output
j which, when it comes in on the flow
! tide, drives the bathers from the surf, and
I frequently off the island. It is likely to
breed a pestilence at any time, and people
i who enjoy salt-water bathing are com
pelled to go some distance up or down the
Atlantic shore line or else go into quaran
tine before returning to the city. The
sewage from the town holds the beach
and the bathers hold their noses.

LIKE UNCLE TOM
Old |Jorman Kennedy y\rgo Was
a FelloW SlaVe of Mrs.
StoWe's Qreat J-Jero
The scene of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was
laid by Mrs. Stowe near the little town of
Paint Lick, in Garrard County, Kv.,
where still stands the home of the old
slave-dealer, General Thomas Kennedy,
the owner of Uncle Tom.
The only living fellow-slave of the orig
inals of the novel is old Norman Kennedy
Argo, now 94 years old. He still stays
with Mrs. Argo," who took him after Gen
eral Kennedy's death. Old Norman is a
little more than three and; a half feet tall
and weighs less than] sixty pounds. He
1 was reared with all the persons, who ap
pear in the novel, and knew Lewis. Clark,
the hero of the novel, especially well. He
says Clark, who was a mulatto, .began
bleaching soon after the death of General
Kennedy, and : after satisfying himself
that he could pass as a white man, stole a
mule in the neighborhood and . went to .
Cincinnati. His wife, Margie, Mrs. Stowe's
Eliza, an octoroon, won on a horserace by
General ; Kennedy :in " Indian Territory,
soon < ran ; off, too, and joined Clark in
Ohio. Old Norman says the wonderful de
scription of Eliza's crossing the river on
the floating ice is a myth. According to
his statements she made the trip on a ferry
boat. Old Argo also maintains , that Ken
nedy treated his slaves well.

MOST UNLUCKY OF ALL MEN.
Joined Each Time by

WIJ.D. FUME JLND POISON ,
Remarkable Hardships Suffered
, by the Dunn Familyâ -Is
This Karma?
William F. Dunn, his wife and two little
children live on the second floor of a tene
ment-house back of 5 Natoina street.' To
reach the place it is necessary to pass
a boarded alley and up a flight of narrow
stairs, and unless the searcher for Mr.
Dunn had previously been instructed how
to go, with some exactness, it is two to
one that the Dunn family would be undis
covered. There are some' people who
deny the existence of luck, pood or bad,
but it appears to the average observer that
Mr. Dunn has passed through more vicis
situdes in three or four years â¢ than can be
attributed to plans or to lack of the same.
In short be and his family have twice been
burned out of house and once blown out
of home in a little over thirty-six months.
"It was this way," said Mr. Dunn, yes
terday, who was just recovering from
violent spells of cramps, which had lasted
nearly, all the preceding night, and was
also nursing his feet, which were badly
swollen from contact last 'week with,
poison oak. He would have work now
but for the poison oak. '
"You see, my wife and myself came
here from England about four years ago
looking for work. We went to live at 134
Front street after we had accumulated a
little furniture/and as I found something
to do for a time we were quite comfortable.
We even accumulated a few knick-knacks,
but not many, of course. Early one morn
ing a gust of wind came and actually blew
out the whole front of the house. With
the house front went down many of the
articles we owned and others were ruined.
"Of course we could not help that," went
on Mr. Dunn bravely, once more nursing
his unfortunate feet. "After a time we
got to going a little once more. Work was
not plenty and the pay was not large, but
we got some articles of furniture. We
lived on Natoma street. A fire came
and destroyed part of our furniture
and the water thrown to put out the names
practically ruined the rest.
"That was pretty hard, but we did not
despair. Once more we had . furniture.
Early this present year we were living in
the rear of 308 Folsom street, . and al
though we were very poor we were com- 1
fortable. Then there came, in May, the j
fire which destroyed the W. P. Fuller & j
Co. establishment. This took place at 3 !
o'clock a. m. We were living on the j
ground floor. Mrs. Dunn could escape j
only by climbing out of a window with the !
children. Everything we had went once
more." . Â.

crowning event in the life of many a lover of j
I this noble game. For the first time in the his
tory of whist, dating back a hundred years and j
' more, has there been such a gathering of noted
experts and writers. Krom nearly every State
in the Union they came to do honor to the
worthy gentlemen who founded the grand and
noble institution and do battle for whist su
premacy. For many months we anticipated
the great pleasure we would eajoy when we
could take the Master "Cavendish" by one hand
and our patron taint, K. B. Trist, by the other,
and pay our respects to our little whist queen,
Miss Kate Wheelock, known and loved from
the Atlantic to the Pacific; then in turn to
receive & warm grasp of the hand from Whit
field (who came to America with Cavendish
to attend the congress), from Hamilton, from
Briggs, from Bunn, from Fisher Ames, Paine,
Weems, Work, Barnes, Schwarz and a score of
others, all there, like myself, to enjoy tne
sweeu of a glorious reunion of whist
giants. If the marriage feast of Cana at
Galilee furnished more real enjoyment to the
guests than did this whist feast, what a grand*
end glorious time they must have had. Every
body bid uÂ« welcome; even the fine uniformed
teutries that guard every entrance to the
great Oriental Hotel smiled a welcome smile .
as we passed them at all hours of the day, and â 
the waves, as they roiied in from the broad
Atlantic, sang a welcome lullaby all through
the night. " Everything was done that money
Mid warm hearts could suggest to make each
one feei as though he were the special guest
of honor. Brooklyn outdid itself, and Robert
H. WeemÂ« should receive great credit for his
untiring energy, real and pluck for carrying
to such a successful ending such a great and '
glorious undertaking. The game of whist is |
not for the gentlemen alone. The struggle we
have made to make whist popular among the
women of the country we are proud to say has
begun to bear fruit.
The Philadelphia Item of June 21 sayt:
It is really remarkable to see what a hold
the game of whist has on the affections of our
fashionable people. Never has the game b-en
more popular, society having taken it up with !
a vim, which may cause the unknowing to
class whist-playing among the fads of a day
which society takes up hurriedly and then
throws away again without a sigh. This is I
distinctly not the case, and, while ourwhi-t
luncheons and wnist breakfasts, whist din
ners, whist suppers, whist muslcales and
what not may be abandoned in time for
something newer, whist-playing, clever
brilliant and scientific, a game for the
battle of intellects, not merely to till out any
empty hour, is so securely rooted In tne af
fections of its thousands of followers as to be
safe from caprice or fashionable whim. The
following well-known ladies will attend the
annual whist congress this week, which will
convene at the Manhattan Reach Hotel, Coney
Island. Miss Wheelock, the whist queen, will
be hostess of the occasion and receive and en
tertain: Mr*. Milton C. Work, Mrs. T. Hol
lingsworth Andrews, Mrs. WiiliÃm H. New
bold. Mrs. R. E. Hastings, Mrs. Charles Wil- |
Hams, Mrs. Wood. Mrs. H. I. Keen, Mrs. E L.
Hall, Mrs. Charles Potts, Mrs. Moulton.
It was a happy thought on the part of the
president of the American Whist Club, also
recording secretary of the American Whist
Leagueâ Robert H. Weemsâ to bring the con
gress down to Manhattan Beach, and the se
lection of the hotel tnat was made famous by
the gatherings that took plac there in times
past. One of the "Whisters" that we had not '<
seen for m By years recalled the night that we
sal together in the same chairs, out on the
broad piazza . .. h borders the hotel, listen
ing to the roar -oi waves as they dashed upon
the beach, not many years before, when the
bells commerced to toll the deathknell of
President Gartieid.
Near us tat a group, never to be forgottenâ

Cameron, Jonn H. Smyth, Austin Corbin and
four or five other great notables. To see them
ail stand up and separate, not a word spoKen,
quietly walk away, take out their handker
chiefs, wipe away the tears that would come,
and to think that nearly every one of them
has been called to render an account of bis
stewardship â it wai a sad few moments at

The whist editor of The Call received the
following letters from some of those who could j
not attend, which were read at the congress.
LETTER FROM SIR WILLIAM POLE.
9 Stanhope Place. Hyde Park W.,1
London, 6 June, 1896. j
My Dear Sir: I am much obliged by your
kind letter of May 21. I have said, in my an
swer to Mr. Weems' flattering invitation, how
much I appreciate the courtesy of the leaeue,
and I may add, to you, that the extension of
that body to the Pacific Ocean by the Western
Association, of which you are the founder and
president, enlarges my feeling of gratitude
and brotherhood in a corresponding degree. I
only wish I could express this personally at
the'openlng session.
I need haraly add how glad I shall be to
make your personal acquaintance it it should
suit you to come over to England, bat you will
find no such whist enthusiasm here as you are
accustomed to in your own eountrv. Yours
very faithfully, Wiluak Pole.
LETTER FROM MAJ.-GEN. A. W. DRAYSON.
17 June, '96, 20 Ashburton Road.)
Southsea, England. \
Mv Dear Sir: I received yours of 21st of
May only yesterday as I hayÂ» been fourteen
days in the New Forest for perfect quiet.
I should, indeed, have much enjoyed to be
present at the congress at Brooklyn. I shall
! be present in though: and shall read with
great interest all that is written about it.
Your articles in The Call, which you have
kindly sent me, are clear and able. I am glad
you found something of value in my -'Whist
Laws," etc. So few Englishmen seem able to
reason out a case, or even to remember the
simple laws, that I believe the dook will be
useful.
My two suggestions, "change your suit" and
the "reverse discard," are no doubt powerful
wi-apons, in spite oi the fact that the oppor
unity for their employment seldo m occuri.
Please express to the 'â¢Whisters'" my com
pliments aud also my thanks for their very
kind invitation, and believe me, very sin
cerely yours, A. W. Drayson.
LETTER FROM ARTHUR RUSSELL.
Royal Courts or Justice, J
London. 21 May, 1896. {
Dear Sir : My father, the Lord Chief Justice
of England, tells me to write and thank you
for your most kind invitation to the Whist
Congress, but to say that he much regrets it
will be quite impossible for him to avail him
self of it. He bids me say that he wishes all
possible, success to the congress. I am, dear
sir, yours faithfully. Arthur Russell.
No doubt many of our readers would like to
know what was done at the congress for the
good of whist. We intend in the next few
weeks to give all the information possible.
We would be glad to receive communications
on the subject on any points that we might
overlook.
PLAYING TWO-HANDED WHIST.
Two-handed whist is being played at some
clubs and private parties, and a variation has
been introduced which makes it resemble
more than ever the regular four-handed game
and has infused new interest la it. The game
is played by dealing to each of the tiro players
one-half ot the cards, one at a time, as in the
regular game. The cards are then placed on
the table in piles of two, so that each player
has thirteen piles.
The top card of each pile is turned up at the
beginning of the game. This leaves thirteen
card.- in each hand exposed. PUy begins with |
the non-dealer, who plays one of his exposed 1
cards, and as soon as the trick is taken he !
turns up the card that was beneath it. In this
way all tae cards are finally exposed and
played.
As two cards make a trick, there are natu
rally twenty-six tricks in all, thirteen of which
it takes to muke a book, after scoriug which
every trick counts one point. Thus, while it
is possible to make thirteen points in one deal,
it is also possible to have no count whatever,
! and in actual play it often happens neither
I player makes a point in a deal.

notes and reasons for locating the cards are !
toa brief.
The Trist Duplicate Whist Club start in on
their fall and winter schedule of play on Tnes- i
day evening. September 1. A full announce
ment will appear in next Sunday's Call.
The Call will be pleased to revive a criti
cism on E. C. Howells' new contribution to
whist literature, "Whist Openings," from Mrs.
F. H. Atwater, Petal uma.
Miss Gertrude Clapp of New York, a whist i
teacher known all over the East, is in hopes to
be able to visit the coast this fall or winter in
a professional way.
The Standard Union of Brooklyn in its issue
of June 26 says in regard to one of the matches
played at the congress: "It â¢srasonly to-day
that the results were given out in the first pro
gressive match for fonr which was piared on
Wednesday. These were anxiously looked for
because there never were so many famous ex
perU pitted against each other." Twenty-five
clubs entered teams of four. The trophy was
won by Baltimore with a total of 670 tricks.
The Trist Duplicate Whist Club of San Fran
cisco came out second, with 677 tricks. The
nearest one to the Trist Club was Amrita
Club, Poughkeepsie, N. V.. with 662 tricks.
The lowest score was 631, made by Jersey City
Club.
Besides winning second place in one of the
principal matches at the congress the Trist
Club of this City was highly honored by hav
ing one of its members chosen as the chairman
of three of the most important committees ap
pointed at the congress, viz. : committee on
laws, advisory committee and press committee.
ANSWERS TO PROBLEM 6.
We have* received five correct solutions from
the following: George M. Mott, Sacramento;
Walter G. Anderson, Â«an Francisco; the Delta
Whist Club, San Francisco; S. N. Newell,
Stockton. But the one that wins the prize
one year's subscription to Whistâ was Miss
Mary Halton of Alameda, Cal. The winner was
selected by the best notes accompanying the
solution. The notes are as follows:
North leads out ace and king of hearts; then
king of diamonds. Suppose East takes it with
the ace, then South discards ace of clubs and
West follows suit.
Now East must lead ace of diamonds. (It is
Imm 1 it-rial which one, as East holds all win
ning diamond!!.) On this South discards an
other club. West follows suit and North dis
cards a heart. East now must lead another
diamond. South discards another club and
West must now play either hit trump, ace ot
hearts or ace of clubs.
Firstâ lf ne plays a trump then North takes
it with the ace; leads a club, which his part
ner trumps; then South leads a heart, which
North trumps, and North leads his other
club, whica South trumps.
Score: N. and S. 6. E. end W. 2.
Secondâ lf West discards a heart then North
takes the trick with a small trump, leads a
club, which South trumps. South leads his
heart, which if West puts on the Jack of trumps
North trumps with the ace and leads his other
club for South to trump.
If West passes the heart, then South wins
and '.cads his trump and the ace makes this
trick.
Score: N. and S. 6, E. and W. 2.
Thirdâ lf West discards a club, then North
takes the trick with a small trump, leads a
club, which South trumps; South then leads a
spaue, draws the jack and North makes his
little club.
â¢ Score : N. and S. 6, E. and W. 2.
If East does not put ud his ace on the king
of diamonds, then this trick belongs to North
and South, and they easily make the six
tricks.

To See Infinitesimal Life
Dr. Gustav Eisen, curator of microscopy
of the California Academy of Sciences,
I whose recent discovery of the life princi
| pies of the centrosorne caused such a stir
I in the scientific world, has just received
from the Zeiss factory at Jena, Germany,
a set of the highest power and finest
I definition lenses that institution is capable
of turning out Higher power lenses are
made by the same factory, but with less
; definition, which renders them unsuit-
I able tor such infinitesimal work as Dr.
I Eisen is at present engaged upon â the
I study of the centrosome as an independ
ent organism.
It was especially for this wort that the
lenses were constructed, and when the im
portance of the discovery was made knonvn
the work on them was pushed forward as
rapidly as possible. Nevertheless, nearly
two months were spent in the grinding of
! them, and the entire set can be carried in
I the palm of a person's hand.
There is little about the appearance of
I these wonderful and expensive pieces of
j glass to describe. They look to the eye
like any other lenses, but their power
comes from the accuracy of their grinding
and the scientific contour of the lines on
San Pablo's .Historic Laurel
The historic old laurel tree known to (
the earliest Spanish settlers about San !
Pablo as the cooking tree marks the spot I
where many of the Indian and eariy Span- !
ish festivities were celebrated. Under its
threat branches Spaniards danced the fan
dango after a tasty meal, of which many
have been cooked in the hollow trunk of
this famous tree.
The trunk at the base is about 6 feet
through and about 20 feet high, tapering
toward the top, at which there is a na- |
turally formed hole as an outlet for the i
smoke arising from the fire built inside.
The cavity inside is 4 feet across, giving j
plenty of room for a person to move afcout '
with the grace and skill of a French cook.
In the fifties this remarkable tree was in ;
all its splendor and was the admiration of
the old Spaniards and others, who loved it !
for its beauty, grace and utility. Previous :

[ which they are constructed, as well as the
quality of glass of which they are made.
In the manufacture of fine high-power
i lenses nowadays, the idea is to con
[ struct them so that an entire set can be
j used in the same microscope tube, which
; enables a student to examine a certain
j slide with several different power glasses
!in a very few minutes. The lower lens is,
of course, the most important, as on it de
i pends the accuracy of all the others. This
â¢ lens is placed in position and focused on
j a certain siide with any of the "eye"
I glasses.
Of course any of the combinations an
very high power, but if it was the lowest
of the set that was used in the first place
it can be lifted out and a higher power
; one put in its place in a moment. The
[ slightest turn of the setscrew is enough to
compensate for any difference in the
focus. The hieher power combination
used the less "neld" can be seen. So by
the combination of lenses a low power can
be used first to make an examination of a
i slide, and then, as certain portions are
! discovered, the details can be examined
I by using as high power lenses as they will
j bear without losing definition.
. Dr. Eisen had not
been in possession of
his lenses many hours
before he had found
something new. Of
course he used them
on the slides with
whicn he discovered
the independence of
the centrosome, and
while trying to make
up his mind just how
much superior they
were to his old ones
he saw a tiny speck
in one of the indepen
dent centrosomes.
This little thing is
enough to lead the
way to another path
of study. Just what
it indicates cannot,
of course, be told for
some time. It may
be that the centro
some willbe found to
possess still greater
possibilities for get
ting at the physical
basis of life than was
supposed a few weeks
azo.
spreading branches of thick foliage, which
afforded them shelter on rainy days and
an admirable natural kitchen.
This tree marks the place where many
councils of the bay tribe of Indians held
conventions. Around its base are many
heaps of clam shells, evidence of big appe
tites of bygone days, when clam roasts
were the pet dish of the Indians. Many
skulls and other relics have also been un
earthed there.
In 1856 Captain J. C. Bairs landed here on
his last trip in the sailing ship Sophia which
arrived from Portugal freighted with wine
and walnuts. The good inducements
offered ashore for men prompted the crew
to desert. After which the ship was sold
and the skipper decided to "swallow the
anchor" and rusticate ashore. He built
his dwelling under this tree on the west
side, on the east side his stable, ihe
branches covering both structures.

The Pops have basted.
Who is going to ratify the thing?
Tbe only label for it is: Mixed Pickles.
"Veni, vidi â where am I at?" says Tom
Watson. _
Sewall no doubt regards it as shockingly
improper.
Anybody who heads off the Texas steers
can have them.
There must nave been a cavity in the
middle of the road.
Sewall and Watson bad better draw
straws to see which way the wind blows.
Politics generally means business, but
sometimes it plays the fool for recreation.
The situation would require a great deal
of explanation if itwere worth explaining.
Â«
It would be interesting to know what
the Populists thou ght they were trying to
do when they did it.
When the delegates come home they
can proudly boast that they mixed things
up to beat the Dutch.
The closeness with which Bryan sticks
to Sewall shows that he is not altogether
averse to having a barrel bandy.
Tne campaign will be smoky, dusty and
hot, but you will find reports of it clear,
clean and cool if you read The Call.
It is to be boped tbe gold men will
hurry up what they are going to do. The
country is ready for the circus to open.
The Populists must intend to adopt the
Kangaroo as an embiem, for in the ticket
they nominated all their strength is in the
tail.

BEYAN'S PREDICAMENT.
Mr. Bryan says he will not accept the
Populist nomination, and he may not,
but the chances are that he will. There
appears to have been much fine political
work during the last days of the conven
tion, and in the light which now shines
upon the tinisbed work one cau see that
those two old and cunning ex-Democrats,
Governor Holcomb and Senator Allen of
Nebraska, have not forgotten the tricks
and craftiness for which they were dis
tinguished when they trained with the
Democratic party. If it was the plan to
nominate Bryan without reference to the
platform and to sacrifice Sewall to solidify
the Southern Populists it may be eaid that
it worked well, but a boomerang has been
hurled which is sure to return and smite
the throwers. Instead of laying the basis
for harmony dynamite has been placed
under both parties, and when the smoke
clears away in November it will be found
that the new Democracy is in shreds and
the Populist party ' with just enough
vitality to build another effort upon.
Mr. Bryan is placed in a most awkward
position, as he will find after the excite
ment of the convention is over. If be
sticks to the Chicago platform the South
ern Populists will not support him. If be
attempts to annex the Populiu platform
to the Democratic platform Northern
Democrats will stay at home on election
day. In the South the Populists will
name Bryan and Watson eleotors in any
event, which will oblige the Democrats to
abandon Sewall or run their own electoral
ticket. In the North and West, most
likely, the middle-of-the-road Populists
will make the naming of Br-an and Wat
son electors the condition of affiliation.
That would exasperate the Democrats, for
in it they would see the extinction of their
party; and, on the other hand, if the
Populists should yield and accept Sewall
they would be repudiating the work of
tneir own party, and their State organiza
tions would go out of existence.
In Congressional and State elections
there could be no co-operation between
the Democrats and Populists, for in a
Presidential campaign the National ticket
is expected to help pull local tickets
through. It would hardly do for a Demo
cratic and a Populist orator to travel to
gother, for one would have to praise and
the other denounce Sewall, which would
be the same as praising or denouncing the
Populist and Democratic conventions.
Mr. Bryan expects to pretty nearly live
on the hustings, but how will he manage
with two running mates who are calling
one another bard names all the time? If
he defends Sewall Watson's friends will
refuse him thnir support, and he would
be in the sam.i dilemma in regard to
bewail. Verily, the young but ambitious
youth from Nebraska is between the devil
and the deep sea, with Populists to the
right of him, communists to the left of
him aud Altgeld on top of him.
CREDIT AND REDEMPTION MONEY
The declaration of the Democratic, the
Populist and the National Silver parties
is substantially the same on the money
question. The remonetization of silver is
not the paramount issue with either one
of them, albeit they all so declare them
selves. Upon a careful reading of the
several platforms it will be found that
their chief aim is to disestablish the
National banks and confer upon the
General Government the sole ri^ht to
issue all forms of money. It will be dis
covered, too, that the chieftain is to re
turn to the "greenback" system of a cir
culating money medium with issues
sufficient for the needs of business, and
which paper money shall be a full legal
tender for all debts, private and public.
It may be said, indeed, that all three of
these parties have adopted the financial
theories of the old Greenback party that
flourished and died between 1876 and
1880. Xhat tneir position is untenable
there is no doubt whatever if the teach
ing of experience in all ages of the world
is of any value.
The power of a Government to stamp
anything and oblige its acceptance an
legal-tender money within its own juris
diction is not questioned, but it would
require a strict application of the most
extreme form of martial law to oblige
commodity values to refrain from adjust
ing themselves to the commercial value of
the thing of which the '-money" was
Â£iade. Commerce knows all about equiv
alency, but it knows nothing about semi
mentalism, and the history of commerce
is that it finally asserts its supremacy,
edicts of governments to the contrary
notwithstanding. The trouble with the I
economists of the parties named is that
they mistake representatives oi value for
value itself.
At this time all forms of money in
this country, except gold, are merely
forms of credit, and they differ from
a banker's draft and the individual's
check only in the certainty that they will
be redeemed upon presentation. The
greenback, the silver dollar and every
other form in which the Government
gives its sight draft upon the treasury for
redemption in actual money is universally
accepted as representing the Nation's
good faith, whicli is backed by its power
of taxation to provide itself with that
which it bas promised its credit money
shall be redeemed in. All forms of the
Government's "money" issue, except
(told, represent the integrity of the people.
Gold possessing the same value in bars of
bullion as in coins needs notning back of
it to sustain its credit.
The mistake these three parties make is
in supposing that the credit of the coun
try is the equivalent of redemption money
ana hence no redemption money is needed,
when, in fact, the country has no credit at
all outside of tho faith of its creditors that
it bas the inclination and the ability to re
deem its credit money. It is of no conse
quence to the users of money what kind of |
credit money they have, whether of metal
or paper, nor do they want to present it
for redemption, hut what tlwy do want
is to know that the issuer has the
ability and is ready to redeem it on
presentation. This feature of credit
and redemption is well illustrated by a
man who, hearing that the bank in which
he kept his earnings had failed, rushed off
to the bank and demanded his deposit.
Very deliberately the teller began to count
out his money to him. "But have you the
money to pay me?" asked the man.
"Plenty of it. Here is your money," re
sponded the teller. "Well, if you hayÂ« it
I do not want it, but if you haven't it I do
want it," said the depositor as be walked
away without his deposit.
The Republican party is for sound
moneyâ money that is sound because
commerce has faith that back of the
Nation's various fortes of circulating
medium is universally recognized re
demption nionsy which the integrity of
the Government guarantees shall be forth
coming on demand. But the Republican
party believes that commerce would be
stronger and more active if the volume of
redemption money were larger, and hence
it proposes to agree with commerce that
the volume be increased by making stiver
dollars coequal with gold dollars in every
field that commerce enters. In other
words it is tho purpose of thÂ« Republican
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26. 1896.
party to extend and deepen the country's
basi3 for a circulating money medium,
while it is tbe purpose of the three parties
named to remove the basis altogether.
NOW FOR THE BATTLE!
Mr. Bryan says he will not accept the
nomination tendered him by the Populist
convention, but what of that? A large
following of Populist leaders who are
favorable to Bryan would support him
anyhow, which is enough to bring the
worst element of the Democratic and Pop
ulist parties under one banner. Indeed the
comoination is now ready to battle for the
overthrow of liberty under law thÂ»t there
may be established in the United States a
system of government based upon the
principles that the Commune of France
has repeatedly tried and failed to make
the basis of a political commonwealth.
But it is better so. It is better that the
lines between liberty and law and com
munism be drawn now. It is better that
the strength of the Nation as a govern
ment of the people, by the people and for
the people be measured now. It is better
that it be determined now whether the
Nation shall go from strength io strength
in the God-appointed work of broadening
and deepening the foundations of liberty,
peace and happiness, or whether it shall
reverse the wheels of human advancement
and turn every man's Hand against every
other man.
The United States has come to the part
ing of the ways. The one leads to Na
tional salvation, the other to National
damnation. There is no middle way, no
place for neutrality, nothing to be com
promised. It is the maintenance of the
Government of the fathers, or it is the
cutting loose from the moorings which
hold the people to certain God-given
rights, -the chief of which are "life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness."
In 1861 the body politic fell sick from in
haling the poisonous fumes of sectionalism
and the spirit of liberty purged it of the de
stroying political microDes. Party lines
were for the time obliterated, and in
united effort unionism confronted and
overthrew sectionalism. In 1881 treason
did not demand the overthrow of the
Government. It demanded a separate
National organisation for itself. In 1896
the demand is for a united country to
annul and set Aside the existing principles
of government and substitute for them
something that is far worse than those
things which impelled the colonies to
separate themselves from Great Britain.
The lines are drawn atid tbe battle must
be fought, and as there is not room
enough in this country for Allgeldism
and the Republic as it is, one or the other
must be destroyed. It is for the people to
say which shall survive.
LABOR AND CAPITAL
The natural relation between capital, so
called, and labor, so called, is one of inter
dependence, and in ratio to the mainte
nance of this relation above the influence
of greed and avarice are all concerned
benefited by intimate association. Cap
ital is money, not wealth, but it may be
come a wealth producer in conjunction
witn labor. Labor is capital, not money
but skill and brawn, and it may become a
wealth producer in conjunction with
money, but neither can produce wealth in
the activities of life independent of the
other. Labor and capital (money in em
ployment) are co-workers for mutual ad
vantage, and whatever hinders one re
tards tbe other. There is no difference in
the ultimate purpose between money that
buys raw material and labor that trans
forms it into finished product, but that
which accrues between labor's income and
expenditure is labor's wealth, and that
which accrues to capital after paying all
cost between raw material and the final
income from finished product is capital
ist's wealth. But if the division of the
accruing wealth is not in harmony with
the importance of each factor in the oper
ation, an injustice is done.
Capital copartnerships are for tbe pur
pose of increasing tbe volume of produc
tion and reducing the cost of it, and as
the tendency of capital thus combined is
to grow greedy and selfish, labor combines
for self-protection, but these combines do
not, or rather should not, impair the
ethical or business force of their natural
relations. It has been demonstrated over
and over again that neither one can be
crippled without the other participating
in the ill effects of the injury. Ir capital
is attacked it retires to a place of safety.
If labor is driven from its occupation its
skill and brawn rusts in idleness. There
fora when caDital is attacked labor should
defend it, and when labor is being driven
irom its occupation capital should come
to its rescue. When this is done there is
recognition of their interdependence and
the final outcome of their standing to
gether is individual prosperity, although
meanwhile tiiere may be very much more
to discourage than to encourage-
To illustrate the importance of capital
and labor recognizing their interdepend
ence we need but to call attention to the
industrial enterprises of California, where
it is tbe underlying principle of tbe bond
which holds capital and labor together in
mutual good-fellowship. When the Wil
son-Gorman tariff act became operative it
well nigh destroyed capital's opportunity
to secure remuneration for its employ
ment, to say nothing of the hazardous
risks it was obliged to take. Neverthe
less, capital ha-1 faith in the good sense
and in the spirit of right and justice in
the people, and it continued the work of
converting raw material into finished
products, which, in turn, maintained its
co-worker, labor, in active employment at
the former schedule of wages. Capital
thus sbieided labor and will continue to
shield it until industries are relieved by
tbe substitution of a more friendly law
for tbe existing tariff act, when labor will
need no more defense. This has been the
relation betwern capital and labor in Cali
fornia ever since the heavy hand of the
Democratic tariff act was laid upon the
country's industries.
And yet, in the face of these facts,
emissaries of tbe Democratic party are
trying to persuade this very labor to
break the bonds of faith and gratitude
with the capital that has tided it over
these years of hard times ana join in an
attack upon it. (Such impudence is
amazing, besides, to make such over
tures to labor is to reflect upon its in
tegrity and to bold it up as the represen
tative of human degradation. But the
labor of California is not made of that
kind of material. It realizes its natural
relation to its co-worker, capital, and it
knows that if it would have a wider margin
between its income and its expenditure it
must come frum increases in income,
which it cannot hope to nave unless capi
tal is protected against its low-wage com
petitors in China, Japan and Europe. The
labor of California will vote as it works
for self-preservation.
THE HONEST POPULIST.
The middle-of-the-road Populist does
not know very much about politics and
less about tbe science of government, but
generally speaking be is an bonest man.
an upright citizen, and is actuated by tbe
best of motives. Ue feels there is some
tiling wrong somewhere in the way the
arfairs of the Government are managed,
and he sincerely believes he has found a
solution for every economic problem. He
loves his country and wouid promptly re
spond to a call to arms without stopping
to ask what it was all about. It would be
enough for him to know that the Nation
had been assailed.
Had the St. Louis convention of Popu
lists not fallen into the hands of profes
sional politicians like Allen, Holcomb and
Weaver, with Altgeld pulling the wires
from under cover, a ticket would have
been named and a declaration of princi
ples formulated which would have re
flected the honest sentiments of a class of
people who, as to personal integrity, hon
esty of purpose and patriotism, would re
flect honor upon any country. The
Simon-pure Populist Is an industrious
man, a good neighbor and a loyal citizen,
but he is no match for such fellows as
manipulated the election of Senator Alten
to the chairmanship of the St. Louis oon
vention.
The real Populist says what he honestly
believes, while the Aliens and the Bryans
say what they do not mean.
The good old rural Populist wants to
see the condition of the country bettered,
while the Aliens and the Bryans want to
better their own opportunities, to gather
in political honor and cash on the side. In
conventions of Populists and ever after
ward the Populists "pay the freight." and
the Aliens and the Bryans divide the
"watermelon."

all of which must be prepared in legal form
and In accordance with official rulet. A model
Is not required unless called for by the exam

Cannot Vote This Tihk-A. C. W., Oakland,
Cal. The statement you present snows that
you were a resident and voter of Oregon up to
the sth of December, 1895, and that you came
to California a few days atter that with the in
tention of locating permanently. Under the
circumstances you cannot vote in this State at
the next election in November because at that
time you will not have been one year in the
State. The law says that no person, otherwise
qualified, shall be entitled to vote unless he
shall have been a resident of the State one
year next preceding the election, of the county
in which he claims his vote ninety days, and
in the election prftcinct thirty days.
Railway Mail Serviceâ a. 8., City. The
question, "Will you please mention in Answers
to CorreÂ«pondenu the names of the different
railroads connecting the following divisions
of the Railway Aiail Service: Albuquerque
and Los Angeles; El Paso and Los Angeles:
Huntington and Portland; Ogrien and San
Francisco; Portland and San Francisco; Ban

land? is not very clear. The fact is that all tha
Hues named are in the eighth division of the
railway mail service. The corporate title of
all lines named is the Southern Pacific Com
pany, except the Albuquerque and Los Ange

Southern California, and the Spokane and
Portland, which is the Northern Pacific Rail
road.
Marking a Ballotâ R. C, City. When A
makes the assertion that on election day in
this City he has at an election for Presidential
electors and other officers marked all the
names he intended to vote for according to the
Australian system now in vogue in thirty sec
onds, he probably means that he marked only
the Presidential electors. An intelligent voter
who has studied tbe names of all the candi
dates to be voted for, when he goes into the
booth and marks one candidate for each office
cannot do it under three minutes; that is, pro
viding he marks one candidate for each office
on the ticket, and is careful to mark an X op
posite the name of the individual candidate
he has determined to vote for. Possibly the
marines may believe the capacity of A to mark
a ticket in half a minute, but other people will
not believe him.
Political Economyâ W. R. 8., Oakland, Cal.
Political economy is the science of public wel
fare, as that welfare is affected specially by gov
ernmental administrations in physioal con
cernsâc. k., in labor, trade, capital, rental,
money, credit, value of product, competition,
etc., though, as by the above definition, politi
cal economy concerns itself chiefly with ma
terial Interests, which cannotâ dealing scien
tifically with the material welfare of such a
beintc as manâ exclude all reference to his
moral and spiritual activity. A discussion to
be scientific must take into account all ele
ments that bear forcibly on the question;
hence much that has been advanced on politi
cal economy had at its beginning forfeited its
claim to science by reducing man to a machine
known as "economic man." As no such crea
ture is known as really existing, political
economy need not discuss his welfare.
The word economy, from the Greek for
house law or house regulation, refers to ths
material portion of the domestic relation, and
does not etvmologrically embrace, c. c, the ob
servance of religion or the communication of
instruction. The mO6t important part in this
use is the adjustment of the expenditure of
the household to the income at their com
mand. The term "political" came to be used
with it as a convenient method of expressing
the application to & state or a sound system of
management in relation toit6 affairs. In later
time, however, the words applied to a commu
nity, has taken a larger and deeper applica
tion. Political economy now means not
merely the art of regulating communities in
their financial and other material affairs, but
also the science of those laws which Provl
deuce has established for their regulation in
ail their material interests. The income and
expenditure of the Government, as ex parte
from that of the people of the community, are
of course under regulation like those of a
household, but these form a department in po
litical economy called "finance." It is evi
dent that In a field so vast and so diversified"
with comDlex interests theie is a likelihood
of a formation of parties of theorizers on
various separate lines. This has been the fact.
The divisions mostly have been casually rather
than icientincally developed, though there Is
a claim to a scientific development of political
economy now prominently made by advocates
ou both siaes of the question whether govern
ment shall positively regulate the proceedings
of the people in all cr any of their physical
interests, or Instead shall trust to the great
natural laws (supply and demand, etc) to
bring to bear through individual action all
needful regulation. Thus, for illustration, if
any were to advocate the extreme of free
trade, such advocates might give political
economy what they would deem a scientific
development In the direotion of trusting ail
to general natural laws; while at theotlier
extreme socialists, and still further com
munists, actually tend to give political
economy what they deem scientific develop
ment in a direction of putting no faith in
great natural laws, but ordering all by govern
mental control.
TWO FASHIONABLE SLEEVES.
Both these sleeves are very chic, when made
of silk and a diaphanous fabric. The bishop
shape is designed especially for such combina
tions, but the other may be made of any ma
terial, using one fabric for both drapery and
fitted sleeve or with a combination.
A blue and white foulard of the large dressy
design so fashionable had the loose sleeve of
piece lace, the drapery of silk being edged with
white lace.
A dress of Dresden silk ha<i sleeve drapery
of black mousseline de sole, edged with a tiny
double ruche of the same. These same ruches
also trimmed the waist.
The bishop sleeve was beautifully developed
in a white organdie with yellow flowers. The
lining was yellow silk.
A very open gray canvas had the fitted
sleeve of while silk, the ruffle braiding, the
puff being of the silk.
A black grenadine with blue and green silk
lining was t cry stylish, the ruffle at the top
being of the silk.
A white lawn dress had tbe fitted sleeve of
green lawn.
A silk batiste of browu color with white
taffetas undÂ«Â»r sleeve wÂ«Â« exquisitely dainty.
The top ruffle was of silk, and tiny ruffles to
match trimmed the waist.

THE PROSE OF
LE GALLIENAE
A Series of JovichiKg
Sketches
HoW bo\te and Beauty Made a
Second JHeaVen on the
Seventh Floor
There Is a suggestion of Charles Lam in
Richard le Gallieune's "Prose Fancies" icc
ond series). The playfulness and the fan ful .
yet artistic use of words constantly brinj to
mind the charming "Kssays o: EliÃ.'' ThÂ«e is ',
also at times a dignity like unto that of ton- j
tfiigne Joined with the deep feeling of t ren >
Meredith's "Nurse of an ailing worlQ be- i
lo\e<l Night," in "The Wanderer." W hal
there is a cheerful humor that is as droj es
Mark Twain's best.
Tht-f-.- qualities, admirably intermin led,
have brought fame if not fortune toLfGal
lienne.
His efforts are not uniform, however, lome
of the sketches in the present volume s&xa to
be beneath the level of this author's .:iuse.
This is notably true ot "The Answer c the
Rose." In the light of present reading tap
pears trivial and inconclusive. Yet t hi very
essfcj may be seized upon by the mystics if the
futureâ those dreamy priests of literatur that
are common to all agesâ and made to a>pear
as the very keystone in the arch ol I Gal
lien ne's fame.
But Le Gallienne has enouKh wit and fithos
in the first sketch of the present series, jailed
"A Seventh-story Heaven," to sweeten abueb. _
larger volume. It is almost impossi,je to
transplant a jest from an author's page % the
reviewer's column without losing in soce de
gree the original flavor. Passages oftentr
ment or philosophy are less sensitive, and,
like hardy snrubs, may.be potted and hajdled,
exposed or exhibited at will for purpfces of
entertainment or embellishment. Herc^hen,
are some thoughts from "A Seventhstory
Heaven":
The seventh story is at the top of ahign
building in the customs-warehouse rirt of
London, where the shops sell nothing b*|t oil
skins, sextants and parrots and whee the'
taverns do a mighty trade in ram.
It was in this quarter for a brief sweet tic ; that
Love and Beauty made their strange hdie, as
though a pair ot halcyons' should choose td est in
the masthead of a cattle-ship. Love and eauty
chose this quarter, as alas ' Love and B,eau< must
cnoose bo many thingsâ for its cheapness Love
and Beauty were poor and office rents in thl quar
ter rrere exceptionally low. But what shot) Love
and Beauty do with an office? Love wag i poor
poet in need of a room for his bed and hi! rl fines,
and Beauty was a little blue-eyed girl wnc loved
him.
It was a shabby, forbidding place, gloojjy and
comfortless as a warehouse on the banks ri >tyx.
No one bat Love and Beamy would have d red to
choose it for their home But Love and eauty
have a great confidence is themselvesâ aconldence
curiously supported by historyâ and the] never
had a moment's doubt that this place was i good
as another for an earthly Paradise 8 Love
signed an agreement for one great room at t c very
cop, the very mamhead ot the buddies:, and leauty
made it pretty with muslin curtains, flow rs and |
dainty makeshifts of furr.lfure. but chle y with â 
the liÃlit of her own heavenly face.
Even in this celestial eerie these twojyoung
people had healthy appetites, and so thi fared
forth to obtain materials for their boiemian
supper. The pdet's purse was almost anapty,
but by pawning a book that had been mt to
him for review the exchequer was replj lished !
to the extent of six-and-Xhree-pence. j
The author admits that ordinaril this
sum is rather light for an incursion of t c mar- j
kets, but explains its sufficiency in tr s case;
by the reflection that only the poor ki >w the
art of dining. It gives one a good tastt in the
mouth to read of that evening's shoppi g.
Yon needn't wish to be hapflier and nerrier
than those two lovers as they gay ly hast ned to I
that brl-.-ht and cozy corner of the tow where |
lovely ham-and-beef shops make glad t!Â» f ; cÂ»i j
of the passers-by. Oh, those hams, wit tbe^r
honest, shining faces, polished like Enah'<;anyâ â¢
and tfce man f(i3ide so happy all day slicing then
with those wonderful long knives (wni;h, Â»f
course, the superior clas^ of reader has nevÂ«r
seen), worn away ;o a veritable thread. > men
wire, but keen as Kxcallbur. Â» â¢ â¢ An* wbt
an artist was tbe carver! What a true eye; whft
a firm, flexible wristâ never a shaving of fat tot
touchâ he was too great an artist for that.
Leaving the occupants of the seventh-story
heaven to enjoy their repast, let us hasten to a
view of "Tlte Burial of Romeo and JulJet" as
presented (for the first time in a manner
worthy of that tragic event:
One morning of all mornings the citizens of
Verona were s art led by" strangp news. Tragic
forces, to which they hud been accustomed to pay
little heed, had been at work in their city during
the dark hours, and young Komeo of the Monta
gues, handsome, devil-may-care lad as they had
known him-, and little Juliet of the Capulets. thai
maa-cap, merry- gentle, young mistress, lay dead
aide by side In the Church ot Santa Maria.
Three days the lovers lay in Mate in th,
etiurch and <i* the fourth by decree of th}
Governor ot the city they were carried tnroug!
the streets in the eyes of ail the people ani
then buried together in the vault of the Capo
leu. During those days, before the entomtj
ment, there.stole a strange â¢weetness over th
city, as though the very spirit of love hai
nested there and was filling the air with it
soft breathing. Men once more spoke kinat
to their wives, and even coarse faces wore
gentle lightâ just as sometimes at evening th
setting sun will turn to tenderness even blac
rocks and frowning towers.
In lighter vein is "The Great Merry-Gt
Round." Another filmy yet entertainiri
sketch is'-T.ie Boom in Yellow." Cariyle i
echoed in "The Fallacy of a Nation," and th
depth of life's philosophy, with a yearning fo
the life beyond, is voiced in "The Greatness r
Man." An uncanny description of death
morbid enough to meet the requirements o
the most inter.be of tbe decadent school, is thi
account of the" passing of Jenny giten tit
Scriptor in his conversation with Lectoi.
The style of the book, its mechanKÃl pro
duction, deserves a word of praise. It v a
triumph of the bock-biuder's art, jofced to *
supreme effort by the typographer.

Jhe Er\gagir\g Story
of
In a Year He Spent a Fortun
But Retained a Gharming
Personality
Here we have the initial work in fiction by
another Western author, Henry M. Blossom
Jr. of St. Louis. In "Checkers: a Hard Luck
Story." ihe writer relates the advertures of a
young man who was ruined by his devotion to
the racetrack. The story is ostensibly told by
a sympathizing friend of "Checkers^ 1 and the
friend tells it welL "Checkers" is first en
countered at the American Derby in Chicago.
A few days later he is met on the street and
invited to lunch â or rather Checkers invited
himseif â at Kwisley's. Chicago's swell restaur
aut. Checkers mentioned that 'the last time
he had taken a meal in that place was with
his wife, a year ago. His friend was surprised,
and said:
"Your wifel You don't mean to tell me you
had a wife ?'' * -
"I had a wife," he answered, sorrowfully,
but-"
"I beg your pardon, Checkers," I said. "I
hope I haven't hurt your feelings."
"No, you haven't hurt them." he replied,
"I've got my feelings educated. I've had so
many ups and downs I've learned to take my
medicine. 3ut I'll bet I've had the toughest
luck of any guy that ever lived. A year ago I
had money, wife and friends, and was doing
the Vanderbilt act. In two short weeks I
lost them all. I've been 'on my rollers' ever
since.
"But, say, you wouldn't have known me if
you'd seen me here with my wife that time â
my glad rags on, a stovepipe lid, patent leather
kicks and a stone on my front. We came to
Chicago to take in the fair and dropped in here
to eat one night."
This was Checkers; penniless, slangy and
illiterate; and yet he possessed a charm which
made a friend of a business man, whose life
was quite outside the gambling circle with
which Cheokers was familiar.
By degrees this friend drew from Checkers
bis hard-luck story. Sometimes weeks would
paÂ«s between the meetings of the friends;
then Checkers would drop into the other's of
fice, receive some good advice, tell something
of his life, borrow some money and depart.
The story is an interesting one and, as we
have said, it is well told. [Chicago: Herbert

STORY OF A PIECE OF COAL
As the author of this wonderful story ob
serves in his preface, the knowledge of the
marvels which a piece of coal possesses within
itself, and which, in obedience to processes of
man's invention, it is always willing to ex
hibit to an observant inquirer, is not so wide
spread, perhaps, as it should be, and the aim
of this little bookâ this record of one page of
geological historyâ has been to bring together
the principal facts and wonders connected
with a piece of coal into the focus of a ftw
pages. In this useful worK by Edward A. Mar
tin, F.G.S., there is found, side by side, the
record of the vegetable and mineral history of
coal, its discovery and early use, its bearings
on the great fog problem, Its useful illuminat
ing gas and oils, the question of the possible
exhaustion of British supplies, 'and other im
portant and interesting bearings of coal or its
products. Originally Mr. Martin's work was
distinctively British in its treatment of the
subject. In order to adapt the edition of the
booic now at hand more closely to the needs of
American readers, a few passages that were
not applicable to America have been replaced
by matter concerning. the coal of this country;
and, at the instance of the American publish
ers, some minor changes in phraseology have
been made. [New York: D. Appleton it Co.

SIR MARK.
The Revolutionary War period and the times
immediately following are furnishing themes
for a host of writers at present. ' Interest in
Napoleon, which was so widespread a year or
two ago, is now eclipsed by the Washington re
vival. In Anna Kobeson Brown's new story,
"Sir Mark," the "father of his coun try" pel
forms a part worthy of his name in connection
with the career of the hero, who is the son ol
a Scottish nobleman who 10.-t his estates and
was driven into exile on account of fealty to
the cause of Prince Charles Stuart. "Sii

i Europe. He sails for America, and finally,
Latter resisting an attempt to convert him tc

H. G. Wells. It prolesses to be the narrative
of one Charles-Edward Prendlck, whose ancle,
Edward Prendick, was reported lost in ttat
vessel Lady Vain, from- the port of CallAO,
When he was picked up, however, "He gave
such an account of himself" (says his nephew),
"that he was supposed demented. Subse
quenily he alleged that his mind was a blank
from the moment of his escape from the Ladj
Vain. His case was discussed among psycholo
gists at the time as a curious instance of thÂ«
lapse of memory consequent upon physical
and mental stress."
The story is based upon certain newspnpei
reports and can be recommended as a well
written narrative of adventure.

It Is not long since American biography wii
one o! the most barren fields In the whole
domain of literature. A few lines of Wash
ington, some strained eulogiums of party
leaders, made up most of the quantity, while
the autobiography of Franklin and the letters
of Wirt constituted about all there was In it
of merit. A different condition of affairs pre
vails now. We are rapidly forming a biograph
ical literature as interesting if not so exten
sive as. those of European nations. We are
learning how to write the lives of our distin
guished men in a way to reveal the humanity
in them instead of portraying them as a set of
stiff statues plentifully coated with whitewash.
Among the recent contributions to our
literature of this kind Is 'Cyrus W. Field, His
Life and Work," edited by Isabella Field Jud
son. It is not a production of any great
literary merit, nor can it be called a compre
hensive account of Field's life nor a just ap
praisement of his work in the world. It has,
however, an enecdotical value, and contains a
number of letters from distinguished person- i
ages which will be read with pleasure by all
who are interested in the private views of
public characters.
The chief defect of the book is that so large a
portion of it is taken up in giving the menus
and speeches of the various banquets at which
Mr. Field was a guest. Hardly more interest
ing are the pages filled with extracts .from
newspapers laudatory of Mr. Field and repro
ductions of the headlines that announced the
completion of the Atlantic cable. These help
to swell tne bulk of the volume, but the reader
feels that the space might have been much
better filled by giving a ruller and more de
tailed account of Mr. Field's work.
Cyrus West Field, the eighth child and
seventh son of David Dudley Field, was born
in Stockbrfuge, MasÃ., November 13. 1819. It
is remembered of him as a child that his deal
ings with his playmates were most exact.
He paid punctually all that he owed and re
quired the same punctuality in return. He
was the chosen leader in all the games ( and
one notabler occasion was- a victor in a race
around the village green, one of the stipula
tions of which was that a certain number of
crackers should be eaten on the way.
In April, 1835, young Field, left his village
home to seek his fortune in Sew York, where
his brother, David Dudley, had preceded him.
A record book, in which he kept an account
of his expenses, affords some curious informa
tion as to the prices that prevailed at that
time. His board and lodging in a respectable
quarter of the city cost him $2 a week. He
paid 12*2 cents for one steel pen and the same
amount to get his hair cut. For a pair of
shoe brushes he pahl'2s cents, while a straw
hat cost him $1. His first employment was
that of an errand boy in the store of A. T.
Stewart at a salary of $50 a year. The second
year his pay wad raised to $100. To enable
nim to live at this time his brother David
loaned him money, but the whole sum was re
paid with interest before Cyrus was 21 years
old.
An anecdote Illustrative of Field's shrewd
ness and boldness is told of this period of his
life. It was a rule of Stewart's that all em
ployes who came to the store a minute late in
the morningor were more than an hour at din
ner or three-quarters of an hour at supper
should pay a fine of 25 cents. The fines thus
collected Mr. Stewart promised nis clerks
should be paid to any charity they might select.
When Field had risen to a position oi influence
with his fellow-clerks he induced them one
year to sign a petitton that the money should
be paid to him to be expended in charity.
The cashier having refused to do this an ap
peal was taken to Stewart himself, who or
dered the money paid to the boys. The rest of
the story can be best .told in Field's own
words:
NOT LIKE THE
REAL GHETTO.
Ar\ Untrue Story of
LoW Life
J"he Tale Is Sordid and Qains
Nothing From Its Manner
of Publication
"YeKl" is the title of a recent book by A. Ca
han, published by D. Appleton & Co.
Mr. Cahan started out with the object of pre
j senting to his readers a picture of life in the
. poverty-stricken Jewish quarter of a great
city. To a writer desirous of treating such a
subject there would occur but two previously
exhibited modelsâ Sir Walter Besant's "Rebel
Queen" and Israel Zangwill's "Children of the
Ghetto." The author of tbe book under re
view has chosen Mr. Zangwill for his Gamaliel,
I and to such an extent has he studied his mas
| ter that we find Mr. Cahan has been under the
necessity of appropriating one of Zangwill's
jokes.
Here, however, the resemblance of the work
of the pupil to that of the master ends. In
"Children of the Ghetto" we have a veritable
study of the doings of the peculiar people. We
find described their mannerisms, their cus
toms, their vices, their vanities. Mr. Cahan
in his work tells us nothing of these. So far
from being "A Tale of the Ghetto," his work
might, with equal accuracy, have been sub
captioned "A Tale of Canal Street" or "A
Chronicle of the Bowery."
But the cardinal defect of "Yekl" is the
flimsy foundation upon which the story is
built. "Yekl," we learn, is the Russo-Poliih
equivalent for Jake, which in turn is the cog
nomen of a young man working at tbe preis
er's trade in a "sweater's" den. He is a mar
ried man, having left a wife and child in
Poland. This fact he conceals from his fellow*
in the sweatshops and from his feminine as
sociates. One of these latter forms an attach
ment for Jake, and love's young dream ie
progressing favorably when bis Polish wife ar
rives at Ellis Island.
Her semi-barbarous manners do not appeal
to Jake as of old, so, with the aid of an old
rabbi, he gives his wife the scriptural "gett,"
or bill of divorcement. He ia then free to
marry a factory hand named Mamie, and the
story leaves him at a point where he is driving
to the City Hall to procure a license.
Th'e'gtory is mean and sordid, and it gains
nothing in the manner of telling. The author
is not particularly well versed in the use of
| qualifying adjectives, nor does he appreciate
theshndes of meaning expressed by the. perfect
and pluperfect tenses. His moods are varying
and irregular, too.
Typographically the book is not all that
could be wished. We notice three errors in
almost as many paragraphs. On the whole,
neHher the author nor the publishers can be
complimented on this very unsatisfactory pro
duction. [New York: D. Appleton & Co. For

"I took the funds, and all of the clerks left
the store that night in a body and proceeded
p Broadway to tho corner of Chambers street.
We then agreed to go into a large, well-known
oyster saloon in the basement. The clerks at
once voted unanimously that we should have
an oyster supper, and that the treasurer should
pay from this fund the expense of the supper,
wnich was done. Then there was a long de
bate as to what charity the balance should be
given to. At last it was unanimously resolved
that there was no such charity in the city or
State of New York as the clerks of A. T. Stewart
& Co.. and that Mr. Field, the treasurer, should
return to each clerk the exact amount of his
fines, less his proportion of the supper. This
occupied until nearly or quite daylight.
"Some one of the clerks or waiters told Mr.
Stewart of what had occurred, and we were all
requested to remain at the store the next even
ing after business hours, when Mr. Stewart
called me up and asked me to give him an ac
count of what had been done with the tunds
paid to me the previous evening. I told him
the exact trutn in regard to the matter, when
he dismissed us, saying that in the fu
ture he should be careful that the firm se
lected the object of charity that this fund was
given to."
After working for Btewart for three years
Field decided to leave him, having received
an offer from his brother Matthew in Lee.
Mass., of $250 a year, with board and washing.
With this brother he engaged and remained
for two years. In 1840, having attained his
majority, he set up business for himself at
Westfield, Mass., as a paper-maker, but in a
few months sold out and returned to New York
to accept a partnership in the firm of E. Root
<fc Co. In 1841 this nrm Uiled, and Mr. Field
then entered into partnership with his broth
er-in-law. Joseph F. Sfcdne, under the firm
name of Cyrus W. Field & Co. Speaking of
this period of his life Mr. Field said long after
ward: "In 1844 I was not worth a dollar.
What money I had made had all gone to pay
the debts of the old firm. My business was
conducted on long credit, and we did a gen
eral business all over the country. I built up
a first-rate credit everywhere. All business
intrustedto me was done promptly and quick
ly. I attended to every detail of the business,
and made a point of answering every letter on
the day it was received."
As a result of this diligence in business Mr.
Field on January 1, 1853, wÂ»s worth $250,000,
being then 34 years of age and having made
that fortune in nine years. He at once turned
to the old claims which he had settled by
compromising ten years before, and pleased
and astonished his creditors by paying all that
he owed them in full with 7 per cent interest.
In an Incomplete autobiography which he be
gan just before his death he states that he in
tended at that time to retire from business,
but was persuaded by his junior partner to
leave his name at the head of the firm and
$100,000 of his capita.! in the business on the
express understanding that he was not ex
pected to devote any time to it.
It was the expectation of Mr. Field on retir
ing from business to find enjoyment and occu
pation in travel, and he did make an extensive
tour through South America. On hie return to
New Yorfc he tried to interest himself in mat
ter- outside oi business, but did not succeed in
doing so. One of his brothers wrote of him at
this time: "I never saw Cyrus so uneasy as
when he was trying to keep still." It was this
restlessness that led him to take an interest
in an attempt to lay a telegraph cable from St.
Johns, Xew Brunswick, to Newfoundland.
At once the bold design was formed to lay a
cable across the ocean. The man hart found
the work for which he of all men on earth was
best fitted, and thereafter his biography is the

j story of peculiar interest, charmingly told.
| The hero of the storyâ a young Englishman, in
Paris in search of material for a novelâ finds a
ring, which be at once assumes to have a mys
tery connected with it. All stories of rings had
I a curious fascination for himâ the ring of

the impression* that the ring he had found

labors of Mr. Field in carrying out his great
work nor to trace the steps by which it was
accomplished, in the face of so many obstacles
and amid so many vicissitudes of fortune.
What he achieved was in no wise- aided by
luck. Again and again his efforts were baffled,
and it was only by a perseverance amounting
to heroism that he at last succeeded. He was
largely endowed with the quality of inspiring
others with confidence in his plans and in his
leadership, and was thus enabled to obtain
money at all times for the object he had in
vi6w. His own fortune he ventured unhesi
tatingly, and at one time lost it all. Against
his indomitable will and fertility of resources,
however, misfortune was powerless.
From the time he first went to England to
get men of capital to interest themselves in
the work until the task was finally completed
by the laying of a cable which yielded perma
nent results, ten years lacking one month were
employed. Many men were of course allied
with him in the undertaking, but the triumph
was everywhere recognized as being mainly
due to him. Justin McCarthy, in his "History
of Our Own Times," says: "He was not a
scientific man; he was not the inventor of the
principle oi transoceanic telegraphy; he was
not even the first man to propose, that a com
pany should be formed for the purpose of lay
ing a cable beneath the Atlantic. â¢ â¢ â¢ But
the achievement of the Atlantic cable was
none the less as distinctly the work of Cyrus
W. Field as the discovery of America was that
6f Columbus. It was not he who first thought
of doing the thing, but it was he who first
made up his mind that it could be done,
showed the world how to do it, and did it in
the end. The history of human invention has
not a more inspiriting example of patience
living down discouragement and perseverance
triumphing over defeat."
Having completed this great work Mr. Field,
with tireless energy, entered upon other
labors. He simply could not be idle. Among
other notable' enterprises that occupied his
later years was that of constructing the system
of elevated raiuoads in New York City. He
also attracted a good deal of attention and
some severe criticism at this period by erect
ing a monument to Major Andre. This monu
ment was twice blown up by dynamite, and
after the second destruction was not raised
again. It was intended by Field as a symbol
of restored amity between England and
America, but the people living in the vicinity
relented what seemed a condonation of the
offense of Benedict Arnold, and Field wisely
yielded the point after the second assault
upon the memorial.
Of the work -of Mr. Field in his later years
the biography gives us but scant memorials.
In December, 1890, he celebrated his golden
wedding, but that was at out the last gleam of
brightness in his life. His wife died in the
following year and then disasters came thick
upon him.
His fortune rapidly vanished in unfortunate
speculations* and we are told it was only
through the kindness of Pierpont Morgan that
he was able to obtain the money to keep in
force the premium on his life insurance poli
cies.
On July 12, 1892, he died in the seventy
first year of his age. His best eu
logium was pronounced at a meeting
of the New York Chamber of Com
merce by his life-long friend. ' William E.
Dodge, who in conclusion sad : "All the disap
pointment and sadness of his later life will be
forgotten and history will remember only the
great loyal American whose intense power aud
large faith enabled him to carry through one
of the greatest and most beneficial enterprises

A TRAGEDY OF NEW ENGLAND
J~he Hard Life of ar\
Horxest Qirl
A Forceful NoM Dark, but Full
of Human Interest, by JÂ«laria
Louise Pool
This is quite a strong story of New England
life by Maria Louise Pool, wherein some
scrong elements of tragedy are introduced. It
takes up the hard life of a poor high-spirited
girl, Judith Grover, who toils terribly in order
to keep her family trom want. Her father is
an idie good-for-nothing, who lives off her
earnings, spending what little she makes in
I quack medicines for his liver. The father, en
raged that his daughter would not take charity
front the neighbors, drove Her from the house.
i Shortly after he disappeared, and Judith was
suspected of killing him.
She refused to marry Lucian Eld red ge, whom
I she loved, fearing to disgrace him, and, in
! order to support her mother, married Richard
, dorald, Lucian's uncle, who was very rich.
In time Mr. Gerald came to love his wife,
knowing she loved Lucian and that he loved
her. Judith was absolutely honest with her
husband, but the strain became too much
when Mr. Gerald Insisted that Lucian should
accompany them on a trip to Algiers. The
madness hereditary in his family developed in
Mr. Gerald and he killed himself, hoping to be
reincarnated in a form Judith would love.
Judith went home, and at last discovered that
her husband had been insane and that she
was innocent of injuring him. The story ends
with a prospect of Lucian's return to her.
The character of Judith Groyer is delineated
in forceful style. Her martyrdom for the
sake of her wretched family is also admirably
described. In short, this is certainly an ad
mirable tale of New England life and a fit suc
cessor to the half-dozen other works by the
same a uthoress. [New York: Harper & Bros.

LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI.
This is a reprint of one of Mark Twain's best
books, issued in Harper & Bros.' New Library
Edition. The work will always be regarded as
an interest i ng contribution to the history of
the country, and, seeing that Mr. Clemens be

naturally be supposed to know whereof he

the spirit of the humorist crops out. For in

when there were no railroads to compete for
river traffic and the present:
"Boat used to landâ captain on hurricane
roofâ mighty stiff and straightâ iron ramrod

'"Got twenty-eight tons of wheat, cap'nâ it'll

doW Jreated at Qreat Length
by the Sketch
Some few weeks ago William Doxey of this
City conceived the bright idea of making an
exhibition In his bookstore of the prominent
symptoms of decadence as evidenced in the
most recent of latter-day literature. From the
Chap Book to the Lotus, from the Philistine to
the Lark, here illustrations of the decadent
tendency were assembled, eloquent and ag
gressive witnesses to the testimony of M. Max
Nordau.
A recent issue of the London Sketch (June
17) devotes two and a half pages to a descrip
tion of Mr. Doxey's "decadent" window. Of
the "Lark," which hails from this City, the
writer of the article in the London paper says:
"It is the reductio ad absurdum of decade>nt
literature. 1 ' This ambitious effort in deca
dence has received full notice in these col
umns, by the way.
That such a creditable exhibition should
have been made in San Franciscoâ tar from
the ceaters of literature as it isâ seems to be
matter for marvel to the Sketch writer. If the
publicity accorded to it serves no other pur
pose than that -of correcting existing English,
impressions of California, Mr. Doxey will have
earned tbe gratitude of citizens of this City

LITERARY NOTES.
M. Francis de Pressense, the well-known
writer on international politics, and one of the
most distinguished of French journalists, has
almost ready a volume on Cardinal Manning.
M. de Pressense is a quite recent convert to
Roman Catholicism.
Rev. P. T. Carew of Newark, N. J., has for
warded us a copy of his "three-act patriotic
drama for schools and academies," entitled
"The Angel of Peace, or the Story of Vene
zuela." It is just about the style of a drama
that the average schoolteacher would write
in a few hours for a children's-class enter
tainment. Its merit lies in the fact that it is
short.
"Reds of the Midi," ptiDlishedJJby Messrs.
Appleton, was the first book ever translated
from a Provencal MS., and the first to appear
in America before its publication in the
original tongue. It is now about to be issued
by Mme. Roumanille. libraire-editeur, at
Avienon, under the title <Â«f "Li Rouge dou
Miejomr. Rouman Istouri," with a translation
in French.
The titles of the very latest French novels
are: "Ame fleurie," by Jean Rameau ; "His
toire dun Honime," by Paul Perret; "Pour
Un Mari," by Marc de Chandplaix; "Les Res
sources Secretes," by Daniel Riche; "Sa
Femme," by Paul Guiraud; "Petit Ange," by
Pierre Mael; "La C rise," by Jean Reibrach;
'CcÃur dOr," by Flagy, and a novel by Gyp,
"Bijou."
. Zola's "Rome" has called forth a number of
pamphlets and even one or two volumes from
fervent Roman Catholics of opinion that the
novelist has misrepresented and attacked their
religion. Yet another publication of this kind
is on the eve of appearing. Its author, Dr.
Moncoq, claims to have written a complete
refutation of a book which he describes as
aussi immoral que monsonger.
A short time ago Professor Flinders Petrie
discovered at Thebes a granite tablet contain
ing the first known Egyptian mention of the.
people of Israel. It was erected by Mercnptah,
whose portrait bust was recovered at the same
time. Professor Petrie has written for the Au
gust Century a full account of the finding of
the tablet and of the character and reign of
Merenptah. This King has been supposed by
scholars to be the Pharaoh who released the
Children of Israel from the bondage imposed
by his father, Rameses 11, but this table records
that he himself conquered the Israelites, prob
ably in Syria.
A new edition of Washington Irving's com
plete works is about to be issued in forty
volumes by Messrs. Putnam. Over 400 illus
trations, mainly photogravures, are promised,
and the publishers have secured, in the prep;
aration of tne designs, the services of a num.*
ber of distinguished artists. The edition, to
be known as "The Holly," will also contain
"Irving's Life and Letters," as compiled by his
nephew. Messrs. Putnam have nearly ready
"The Stories and Legends from Washington
Irving," a book containing the most popular
tale* told by the "Addison of American litera
ture."
The Critic of July 18, apropos of the cen
tenary of Robert Burns' death, reviews several
recent volumes bearing upon the life and
writings of thtfpoet, whom it rates among the
world's greatest lyric writers. Mr. Zangwill's
monthly essay is devoted to a report of his
one-sided conversation with the Young Fogey,
a type for which he professes little admira
tion. Some "Talks With Tennyson" are inter
estingly summarized; and among the illustra
tions are an excellent portrait of Mr. Glad
stone, with quotations from his essay on "Man
making and Verse-making"; and reproduc
tions oi designs from Mr. Beardsley's edition
of "The Rape of the Lock" and Mr. Le Gal
lienrje's edition of "The Complete Angler."
Z Shortly after the appearance of Dr. Oscar
Hertwig's "Praformation oder Epigenise" a
detailed abstract was published by P. Chalmers
Mitchell In one of the scientific journals. The
momentous issues involved in the problem of
heredity and the great interest excited by Dr.
Weissmann's theories made it desirable that a
full translation of the work should be issued.
Heinemann, the London publisher, has under
taken to publish the book, which Is entitled
"The Biological Problem of To-day: Preforma
tion or Epigenesis? " and the volume will con
tain a nineteen-page introduction by the
translator and an index and glossary. Pro

THE FIRST PIQTURE OF THE SEASONâ ON THE TRAIL
JHL <J. Crocker's
Stamp Collection
Philatelic Gems Owned by
the President of the;
.Horse Show
Henry J. Crocker, president of the
Horse Show Association and a member of
ell the prominent clubs of the City, is one
of the most enthusiastic stamp collectors
of the coast, and his pretty and cultivated
wife is no less devoted to the fascinating
pastime. He has been a collector for more
than twenty yÂ«xÂ«rs. but for the past few
years has devoted more time and money
to this hobby than ever before. As a con
sequence he now holds the foremost place
in the ranks of philatelists of the Pacific
Coast.
Very recently he placed to his credit the
record of having made the most notable
purchase of stamps in San Francisco, and
in fact wesi of the Rocky Mountains.
Tempted more by the fine condition and
the handsome appearance of the collection
of Eugene Gesvret of this City, also a
prominent collector, ttian by the number
of stamps therein that he desired for his
own collection, ho opened negotiations
Witb his fellow-collector, and within the
remarkably short period of about half an
rjcu/ an agreement was reached whereby
Mr. Crocker was to become the owner of a
collection of stamps worth, according to
catalogue figures, not less than $15,000.
On the same day he also purchased a
considerable nuniDer of rare Hawaiian
stamps from Walter Giffard, a prominent
collector of Honolulu, who is en a visit to
this country. This acquisition consisted
of labels known as Hawaiian numerals,
end permits Mr. Crocker to justly boast of
having one of the best collections of Ha
waiian stamps in the United States.
Among the rarities that Mr. Crocker
now possesses of that country are three
â¢pecimens of the 5-cent and three of the
13-cent missionary stampsâ that is, the
first postal labels credited to the Hawaiian
Government. These are worth irom $450
to $600 each.
Mr. Gesvret's collections comprised the
lnbcls'of all the countries tbat have issued
itanips, except those of the United States.
He retained, however, the issues of the
United States of Colombia and of the
Irench colonies, and he will make a
specialty of the stamps of these countries.
The collection is mounted in several
handsome and expensive albums. Mr.
Crocker intends to keeD them in the shape
in which he acquired them, .and will prob
ably rearrange the older portion of his
collection on the same plan. It took Mr.
Gesvret about five years to mount his
ciamps, as be exercised the greatest care
in order to wcure the best possible effects
en tbe album pages.
During the past two years Mr. Crocker
lias made many auditions to his stamps,
as can be judged from the fact tbat while
he valued his philatelic possessions two
years ago at about $40,000 he declares that
at the present time he could not be tempted
to part with them â that iÂ«, his collection
aloneâ for $75,000, while his duplicates are
worth in the neighborhood of $20,000.
It is in the more recent plate numbers of
the United States that his albums shine
resplendent, and his Unitei States stamps
alone are said to be worth about $8500.
In view of the many diverse interests
tnat require Mr. Crocker's attention he is
considering the advisability of employing
a special secretary to look after his phila
telic interests.
British Guiana rarities are represented
by no less than seven of the circular
eta raps, worth several hundred dollars
each.
Plate numbers in Great Britain are also
f hown in great profusion, among the ex
treme rarities being a copy of plate 17 of
the sage-green 4d, and one of the 10 i red
brown, plate 2. The latter is valued at
$500.
Three of the 5-cent and the same num
ber of the 10-cent stamps of St. Louis or
nnment one page, and are a matter of spe
cial pride to tbeir owner. Each of these
is worth a couple of hundred dollars.
Will H. Crocker, the president of the
Crocker- Wool worth Bank, is also a very
prominent end enthusiastic collector of
â¢tamps, and between him and his cousin,
Henry J. Crocker, there exists a pleasant
but nevertheless determined rivalry as to
which shall eventually possess the
choicest aggregation of these little scraps
of insignificant appearing paper. Up to a
year ago Will was somewhat in the lead,
but with" the impetus secured by Henry in
the acquisition of the Gesvret collection
and the Giffard Hawaiian numerals the
latter has a start that will be very dim
cult to overcome.
John A. Btaats, proprietor of the'Sheri
rian Hotel, has a valuable setter, for
whioh he has refused several large offers of
purchase money. He now thinks more
highly of tbe dog than ever.
Mr. Staats made up bis cash and checks
yesterday and put it in his bankbook to
deposit. When he reached the cashier's
window at the bank the book and money
had disappeared. It contained Saturday
night and Sunday business receipts.
He retraced his .steps hurriedly to locate
the missing roil, if possible, when Fannie,
the setter, came running down the street
with tbe missing bankbook in her mouth.
Mr. Staats dropped it near the hotel us he
pulled a handkerchief from his pocket.
Fannie discovered the loss and ran after
her master with the money.â Newark

The Season's
First Pictures
JJmedee cJoullin's- Brush .Has
Been Busy With Out
door Studies
For the last six weeks nearly all of the
studios in the City have been closed, the
artists being at work out of doors, paint
ing or sketching from nature. It is still
too early to tell exactly what has been
done, as many of- the painters have not
yet returned, and those that have, with
one exception, are not prepared to show
any finished work. The exception hap
pens to be Amadee Joullin, and the work
he has finisned and ready for exhibition is
worthy of the greatest praise.
During the present season Mr. Joullin
has worked upon the same motifs with
which he was so successful last yearâ the
sand dunes about the bay and along t^he
seashore and the ever fascinating streets
of Chinatown. And taken altogether his
last work shows much improvement over
his previous efforts, both in technique and
composition. In his previous works Mr.
Joullin was content to make simpie tran
scripts from nature; that is, he painted
his pictures from nature, but made little
attempt to tell a story by the positions ol
models and the careful selections of sub
jects. While he has not entirely departed
from the old scheme his most ambitious
work this year is aliEe and yet unlike any
thing he has heretofore painted.
In all there are fix new canvases in Mr.
i Joullin's studio. Three of them are scenes
alone Alameda Creek. All are treated
broadly and show the different-colored
sands of the different localities, which are
so much alike and yet so different.
One of the new canvases shows a lone
stretch of the Oakland estuary and
the Alameda bridge in the distance.
This picture is full of light and color. It
has the licbt hues of the sand, sky and
water, and at the same time is h'lied with
the pearly brown-grays so common in this
locality. Truly a creditable study.
The most ambitious picture which Joul
lin has undertaken this year he has en
titled "On the Trail," and a very realistic
bit of painting it is. As the title indicates,
it shows a couple of Indians on the war
path. They have come to a ridge of sand
and one of them is stealthily crawling up
the side while the other waits near by,
gun in hand, ready for tne sudden appear
ance of a foe.
The picture is about 2)^x4 feet and was
all painted from nature. It is unusually
free from conventionalities, particularly
in the selection of the garments worn by
the Indians. It is common in painting
such pictures to attire the noble red man
in garments decorated in all the colors of
the rainbow, so that they appear as bril
liant splotches of red, yellow and blue.
But Mr. Jouilin has entirely departed from
this idea and the garments worn by his
Indians are of that peculiar gray that
makes them appear almost the same color
as the sand. The few bright colors worn
in the headgear and around the belt are
as they should be.
Tbe painting and drawing in the picture
are particularly good. The handling is
bold and free without any attempt at fancy
brushwork. The working out of the values
was a difficult task, as it was necessary in
some case" to make light come out of a
shadow. Tnis is apparent in tbe figure of
the Indian holding the gun. As a land
scape tbe work is most truthful. The grass
is of tbe vivid green it really is without
any rawness of color.
Mr. Joullin also shows another am
bitious piece of Work in the shape of a
street in Chinatown. This is undoubtedly
Mr. Joullin's best work on Chinatown sub
jects, and is, very likely, far in advance of
anything of the kind ever painted by a
local artist.
In the treatment of tbe picture tbe
artist has grasped the forcible effict of
light and shade and the strong contrasts
of color produced by the flowers and vege
tables in front of the stores. At tbe same
time every object, Â»o matter how insignifi
cant, is made to keep its pine?. The lines
of perspective are most skillfully handled,
as they are broken in just the right places
to overcome any stiffness. Taken as a
whole, tbe picture is most creditabl e. It
is painted with the full force of tbe
palette, and is brilliant in color.
The principal change observable in Mr.
Joullin's work, when compared with his
last year's productions, is a freedom from
"paintiness." His pictures are, if any
thing, more brilliant in 'color, but look
more like nature and less like pigment
and canvas.
Early one morning, after vainly en
deavoring to sleep, 1 went outside. Tbe
stars were shining in the sky of dark, rich
purple, lightening to a yellowish tone on
the- northern horizon. The vast desert
waÃ a great mass of delicate lilac and
green and the igloo a brighter note of the
sime color. The dogs, curled up in balls
and almost covered by the snow, were so
many black spots. The wind blew shrill
and chill and tha snow streamed and
eddied in long veils over the lonely desert.
The tents flapped like great birds alight
ing and tbe wind-gauge kept up a monot
onous tap-tap-tap. The utter loneliness
and desolation of the scene were so pene
trating that I was glad to creep over the
recumbent forms of my companions into
the shelter of the sleeping-bag, where I
shivered and dozed until the bright sun
called us again to life and action. Frank

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
A Letter From jionrxe
BY CHARLES D. BOUTH.
Do ye listen, my lad, as I spelis my way?
(For these specs gets foggy, though fair's the day.)
Are ye getting the sense? Is it "Aye" ye say?
Can it be there's a lump in your throat? â¢
Well, it's devilish long, is a three years' cruise,
(And grog isn't always a cure for blues.)
And a page like this is the kind of news
That strikes on the heart's keynote.
Aye, the christening song and the wedding bell
And the solemn sound of the parting knell
We can hear, through the sea, as the lines we tell.
With their splicing of joys and woes.
But the letter it touches a deeper spot,
For it shows that we're never a whit forgotâ
And no jewel can fall to a seaman's lot
Like the love, when he's gone, that glows.
There are eager arms on the distant shore,
And there's brine on cheeks that no wave dashed o'er,
And there's love right through to the bosom's core
For their Jack on the billows green ;
And the flag grows dearer for thoughts like these,
For its folds unite- us across the seas,
Speaking God, home, country, in every breeze
That courses the poles between.
It's a sometime thought, "We are mere machines
For use at the butts of the ship's carbines ;
We're triggers and targets at best, it means,
To be Jacks in a foreign sea";
But this tear-soiled letter it brings me back
To the home-love dear as his life to Jack,
And my thoughts they shift and my thoughts they tack
Toward the haven that yearns for me.
Ye may read it, ladâ it's the girl's own hand ;
She's mineâ she'll be yours when we reach the strand
Where burns love's beacon to bid us land
In the place to heaven most near.
Makes love more sweet, does a cruise like this;
Makes love more fond, and a rarer bliss
When the sea-rover speeds to a greeting kiss
That is splashed by rapture's tear.
Than the airs from the isles of the summer seas
Give me rather a smack of the northern breeze;
And my bread needn't grow on the breadfruit trees
Where the lithe Samoaas roam.
Them as choose may the pipe and the bowl employ
As comfort's moorings â they're pleasure's alloy â
But there's naught for us here with a tithe of the joy
Of this letter from " Home, Sweet Home."
World's Presbyterian JHlianee
Sathering of the Calvinistic Clans at Glasgow as Told
:-, 'â  by the Rev. '.Henry C. .Minton â¢ '<â :',
of This City
LONDOJJ, Kkg., July 1. âTo those
who are interested in the drift of
things in the religious world it is worth
while to know that the quadrennial meet
ing of the World's Presbyterian Alliance
has just been held in the city of Glaseow
in Scotland. The allitir.ee represents 30,
--000,000 people. Nearly a hundred differ
ent churcbop from all parts of the world
are connected with it. It includes only
Â»och Protestant churches as hold to the
Presbyterian system of church govern
ment and to what is called the- "reformed"
system of doctrine. These churches, for the
most part, springing from Switzerland,
France, Holland and" Scotland, adhere to
that system of interpretation of the
Scriptures which was taught by St. Augus
tine and reaffirmed by John Calvin at
Geneva.
To attend this great council I crossed
America and the Atlantic. Glasgow is
certainly an appropriate place for the
gathering of the Calvinistic clans. It is
the largest Presbyterian city in the world.
It has 275 Presbyterian churches. Of
course it is a mere accident that Glasgow
is also the least but best governed city on
the face of the earth. Albert Shaw told
the world that several years ago in the
Century Magazine, and a visit to the great
metropolis proves it to be true.
The council convened in tap historic
cathedral June 1, at high noon. A proces
sion was formed at the Old Barony Church,
near by, led by the Lord Provost and the
city magistrate in regalia, and, though the
rain spoiled the effect, it was an imposing
march to tbat grand old pile. The cathe
dral Is history in stone. The music was
exquisite, the famous windows magnificent
and the congregation large and cosmopoli
tan. The associations of the spot {rave a
solemn and impressive grandeur to the
occasion, for every block in those gray old
walls and columns is a monument of the
checkered past.
The subsequent sessions of the council
CHINATOWN LIFE, BY JOULLIN
were held in the St. Andrew's Hall. It
seats 4000 and holds 5000. The c are
always theologians where there are Pres
byterians, and it would be hard to fire a
gun in the streets of Glasgow without
bombarding theology. That was the city
j of Thomas Chalmers, and there are giants
| there now. The world has heard of Pro
fessor Drumraond, who is chronically ill,
having been away from home for months,
and bis convalescence is painfully slow.
Here are such well-known men as Profes
| sors Bruce and G. A. Smith and Principals
I Caird and Douglas, and many like them.
Rev. Dr. John Watson (lan MacLaren),
! now of Liverpool, was once pastor of the
church of which the scarcely less known
Dr. Stalker, whose hospitality I enjoyed,
|is now in charge. Watson was booked
i for an address before the council, but
measles in his family quarantined him at
home.
The council was a success. If any evil
eyed prophet foresees the decay of that
: section of Christendom he would do well
ito consult bis oracle once more. No more
can I see the symptoms of decline else
where. Brains and heart and money and
energy and enthusiasm always count, and
in these much slandered latter days Chris
tianity has them all.
The people of Glasgow were deeply in
terested in the meetings throughout. The
daily papers not only reported every ses
sion but also had able editorials upon its
doings. Papers were read and discussed
in the morning and afternoon sessions:
i "sederunts" and popular addresses were
! delivered in the evening. The papers were
expected to be close and careful treat
ments of themes assigned in advance.
The church that honored me with a place
in the council is (he Jargest in ttie Alli
ance and presented three papers â one by
General Prime of New York, one by Pro.
fessor Zenos of Chicago and one by the
member from San Francisco.
Principal Dykes of LÂ«ondon was perhaps
the most colossal intellectual figure there.
Dr. John Hall was heard often and eagerly.
The new president, Rev. Dr. Lang of
Glasgow, i 3 an easy talker, who has the
enviable knack of saying good things
without seeming at all to try. Dr. Hoge
of Richmond was counted a Prince among
American orators. Professor Comba of
Florence is eloquent, and Dr. Cochrau of
Canada is, as Hancock said of Phil Sheri
dan, a "cyclone with spurs." We can out
talk them over here, but I am not so sure
but they can outthink us. They are
scholars certainly. Professor Salmond of
Aberdeen is keen and clear cut, and Dr.
Orrof Edinburehisthe worthy successor of
grand old Principal Cairns.
There was a general harmony of tone
throughout. No one who knows Presby
terians, especially Scotch ones, would ex
pect entire agreement in everything.
Some were predicting in advance that
Glasgow would be a storm-center, hut it
was not. Presbyterianisrn has not lost its
bearings nor forgotten its faith. It has its
face turned toward the future while it has
its band fixed on the past. Without doubt
they are more advanced over here than we
are in America along certain lines, but
there is an evident reaction from the ex
treme position of a few years ago, and any
suggestion is quickly resented that they
are departing in any essential principle
from the faith tor which Scotland was bap
tized in the blood of the fathers.
Nor was Glasgow's hospitality of a small
sort. A reception was given to the Council
by the Lord Provost and his wife, Lady
Bell, who are good Presbyterians. Satur
day was given to a delightful excursion
among the famous lochs near by. Wednes
day afternoon Lord and Lady Overtoun
gave a reception at their country house
near Dumbarton. They provided a
special train for their 800 guests, and met
them at the station with thirty or forty
three-horse brakes to convey the party to
their magnificent home two miles distant.
We could have refreshments any time
and almost anywhere. A band of robust
Highlanders, with kilt and bagpipe, en
tertained the guests on the grounds,
and at 5 o'clock in a great tent the w hole
company was seated and bountifully
fed.
Lord Overtoun,. handsome, generous
and popular, is, as he says, a Presbyterian
to his finger-tips, but was the first to eive
Â£10,000 to Day off the debt on the Y. M.-
C. A. building, for which he gave the lot.
I was told that he pays the entire salary
(S6COQ) of a minister, whose fame is world
wide, and gives him a roving commission
to go where he can do the most. good.
Scotland is safe as long as she ti as many
men like Lord Overtoun, and no man be-
grudges him his Â£5,000,000 or Â£6,000,000,
couple:! with his Christian generosity.
The council adjourned to meet next in
Washington, D. C. San Francisco was
thanked for invitation, but distance was
against it, Hjsuby C. Minxom.

Asrou follow tha old stage road from
i Shasa Valley into the huge mountain
* oasir where once the Snasta Butte gold
flats rere and the busy little city of Yreka
now las, yon pass what is called in these
partathe Tancheria. It is, practically, a
smal Indian reservation. A short dls
| tance from the road you may notice a
| thickferoup of toll mountain pines, it is
I a lon|y spot, and if you think at all 'about
it yoiconclude that the little forest is yet
virgij soil and tbat the trees shelter no
humti habitation.
Bu you would be wrong in this con
clubhi, for in the midst of this forest
stan<Â» a little log cabin, which iB in
babiÂ»d by the very oldest resident in all
these wild and romantic partsâ by one,
too, rho is, perhaps, better known aftd,
at Blfevents, more famously and favorably
knowi t ban auy other one inhabitant of
SfskSou and Shasta counties.
Th- name of this oldest inhabitant is
Old Peggy, and the pure blood ot the
ShasÃ branch of the Rogue River Indians
i flowein her veins. Her face is wonder
j fullynrrinkled, yet a kindly old face, and
| one vat is liked in the region more than
the solid, red countenances of many a
younjer Indian. The old settlers remem
ber wien Peggy's face had no wrinkles
and fcey remember it then with gratitude.
Once it came to them in the hour of a
grearperil and brought with it a warning
j that averted human slaughter. All the
yourjer generat ion Snow the story 'aud
doubdess it will be handed down in years
to ccne as one of the folk lore legends of
the g-eat Shasta region. It is time to tell
it nor, while there are still those living
who lan vouch for it being something far
moresubstantial than a legend.
In the early fifties Humbug Creek
mines numbered about 200 in all. The
Shasa Indians were none too friendly at
best,but for a long while there had been
no (pen hostilities, and at this time the
mines had almost forgotten their old
quarjls with the redskins and were in
tent mly upon gathering the golden fleece
from the hillside drifts, which repaid their
untirng labors so richly.
Bunt-he Shastas nursed their wrongs â
real >r fancied. It is scarcely remem
berednow just what these were, and the
bistoies are silent, indeed, concerning the
entireevent. Now, while the gold-search
ers waked and slept in fancied securiiy
the rdskins plotted in secret. At last
they Jfcld a great powwow, and the end
of it ws that the edict went forth that all
palefaes on Humbug Creek must die at
midnFjht, and the night chosen for the
massare was the one when Peggy and her
sister, Fatty, appeared suddenly in the
minerf camp, after a tramp of ten miles
from he headquarters of the assembling
braves at the Yreka flats, and warned the
palefaes of their impending doom.
Tne.varning came not an hour too soon.
Ammtnition was scarce and the Indians
greath outnumbered the miners. Peggy
and Atty's advice was to hide in the
drifts. This the miners did, taking pro
vision;: enough with them to last several
days. The two squaws hid with them,
and tie last man had scarcely crawled
into th> golden tunnel before down came
the redkins in all their war paint. For
two dtys the Indians camped on the
groum; waiting for the miners to return,
but bal not wit enough to search among
the g4d drifts for them nor daring
enougl to attack them from such a point
of vanlge had they i>y chance discovered
the h^ing-place. Finally the Indians
gave lp the siege, and when the pro
visions were gone tha miners ventured
out, aid some renewed their work in the
mines, while others went to Yreka for
ammunition.
Pegg; and Fatty returned to their camp,
taking irith them money, clothes and pro
visions, This was done to make the In
dians tlink that they had been out on one
of theii begging trips, which they were in
the halit of making quite often through

V i |Window Gardens
In San Francisco
A Pleasant Domestic
Occupation â  JKat
Beautifies the
Street
Whether it be that flowers are so
abundant and so cheap at all times of the
year in San Francisco, or whether people
have come to imagine that flowers and
decorative plants need a gardener to grow
them, there can be no doubt that the
pleasing art of window gardening is badly
neglected in this City. To be sure one
Bees in almost every house a few potted
flowers, a few geraniums perhaps and one
or two other plants, but too often these
bits of nature's own decoration are stunted
and wholly devoid of the loveliness of
flowers. Here and there an unsightly box
from the grocery-store, beside empty to
mato cans, all in a row, and each with its
poverty-stricken plant, stuck upon a shelf
or a wimiowsill, form much of the bad at
tempts at window gardening. They are
to be seen wherever one goes in San Fran
cisco, and it is a positive relief to come
upon an occasional successful effort in
beautifying the home with flowers.
ing could be more lovely than these dis
plays of foliage and blossoms that tell
their own story â always and ever the
same, of a kindly, intelligent nurse, and a
ptory of good taste and refinement.
In a city like San Francisco where the
gardens bloom on all sides summer and
winter alike and where the love of flowers
Is strongly impressed on those who give
the subject any thought a really striking
contrast is presented by the flower and
window eardens. There is some kind of
belief that boxes of flowers in windows in
jure wooden houses â that is, trailing plants
destroy the paint, and water escaping
from the boxes helps, to decay the wood
work. And this same popular fallacy
deters many a householder from setting
out some floral gems in boxes or in pots
either. As fcr climbing plants they are
out of the question with such people. A
little attention to the proper drainage of
boxes will prevent any injury to the wood
work of tbe house. All that is needed is a
drain bole or pipe near the outside of the
box. Such a queer opinion has had its
effect undoubtedly upon thousands who
sacrificed their little window gardens for
fear of the paint. With this difficulty dis
posed of it is difficult to understand wny
6au Francisoo should not be noted far and,
near for the beauty and splendor of her
window gardens.
The conditions are peculiarly favorable
to such displays in a very superior form.
There is no frost to speak of, no changes
of temperature sufficient to nip delicate
flowers in their bloom, no intense sun to
wither them in summertime. But, on the
contrary, barring the strong winds, there
is an evenness which tempts flowers to
blossom all tbe year long.
If you would ask for proof of this as
sertion in favor of San Francisco look
around at any time and see the brilliant â 
flashes of color from porch and window- |
sill, and the restful, delicate palms and !
luxurious exotics behind the glass. And
if these are too few aud far between they
only serve to strengthen the impression
that San Francisco is the home of window
flowers.
In many instances lack of knowledge
appears to have more bearing on the
scarcity of window gardens than Hack of
interest. People will say, "What's tbe
v>se? I don't kuow how to grow flowers in
pots. They all die on me." One or two
failures give experience, and then with
care and common-sense and a word of ad
vice from some friend who understands
floriculture it will be easy work to make
your window the admiration of all who
pass by. The gardener in charge of tbe
Golden Gate Park conservatories illus
trated this very clearly when he said re
cently:
"Ladies come out here all the time and
ask me for information. They say their
palms and potted plants die, and they
want to know what to do for them. They
buy palms and decorative foliage plants
and in a month or two the plants wither
and die.
"These ladies either drown the plants or
let them wither for want of water, or
throw them around like bits of furniture,
in the shade now, in the sun next; then
in a draught and again in a room over
heated by fire. Some of them have corns
back. They like to see the conaervatory
displays, and if they meet me they say
their palms and other potted plants* give
no more trouble, and it was so simple it
surprised them."
The cost of starting a bounteous win
dow gardpn should be no obstacle in the
way of the novice, for it is practically ht
tle or nothing and certainly the game is
worth the caudle.
The variety of boxes depends on the in
genuity aud versatility of the designer.
For instance, a common little bax from
the drugstore or grocery may be made at
tractive by covering its front and aides
with bark or sticks laid side by side m a
veneer; or again by building up about it
Â» rows of straignt shoots of trees in the
fashion of log-cabin architecture. Boards
rougnly sawed and nailed together make
a good window box when covered on front
and ends with linoleum.
If a stylish box is desired one can boy j
those fancy tiles for a trifle and have them
fastened on the front and ends by a small
frame of molding. For a novelty au imi- I
tation fence, either rustic or rail, or picket,
gives a pleasing effect and serves the
double purpose of railing in pots or
boxes and hiding whatever shortcomings
they may have. However, if the best ef
fect with most satisfactory results is de
sired, a plain box painted green must be
used.
"Window-gardening should bs encour
aced here," remarked Superintendent
John McLaren of Golden Gate Park the
other day when asked for his views on the
subject. "We have found from experience
here in the park that almpst all flowers
will do well in tbe open air. As for win
dow-gardening, I have not given it much
thought, but then it is the same as flower- !
gardening. It in a simple thing to select
your flowers for effects and contrasts, j
Window-eardens in this City should face
the east to get the best results, as you can
not grow nice flowers in the wind. How
ever, some of the hardier geraniums grow
well in partly exposed positions. I re- j
member having seen when traveling in
Europe those little nasturtiums trained j
from boxes all around window*. They
formed a complete frame of flowers and I
foliage, and the effect was wonderfully
pretty. This is ju3t one of the many ways
of treating flowers in the window. But
you want to know what's best for San
Francisco.
"There is nothing better for the ama
teur than meseinbryanthemum. You can
grow it anywhere from little cuttings, and
it requires no attention. Any soil will
suit it, and in a short time its flowers form
a great mass of bright pink hanging over
the box.
"Those who like climbers should have
tbe Australian pea vine, the neatest
grower of ali. It can be grown from seed
in early springtime in the box. Its leaves
are pretty as smilax and it has a neat pea
like flower. Morning glories and the small
nasturtium do well with th# beginner,
and in warm, sheltered spots smilax will
grow nicely.
"Lady Washingtons and all tbe geran
ium family luxuriate in window boxes,
and with ivy geranium and mesembryan
themum as hangers you can get a show
equal to the finest and best These plants
will grow for three years very well, but
won't have tbe same fresh look as when
the soil is changed twice a year. Lady
Washingtons grow from slippings started
in the fall, though they will strike root
any time from March to October if put
into sandy loam, half sand and half loam, â 
or better still, leaf mold. After rooted, ,
or when transplanting them in their per- j
manent quarters, enrich them with
manure.
"You don't want things that grow too
rampant or strong, but only those neat in
habit and bright in color. Every summer
box sbouid have some mignonette. Sweet
alyssum, the variegated form, planted
alternately with blue Jobelia, will make a
pretty showing, or the yellow viola wi'.b '
the blue, or with lobelia. I wonder that !
the viola, or summer violet, is not grown !
more generally on the peninsula. It is ,
best to treat the perennials as annuals.
"For early spring flowers, tbe daffodil, :
crocus, snowdrop and hyacinth are best.
Hyacinths should be put down three
Inches in sand. People generally plant '
them too shallow, and the result is the j
sun starts growth prematurely. By plant- '
ing deep there are no leaves, but a better ;
flower. The box should be planted twice
a year if you desire a succession of bloom,
and the soil should be changed at each
planting.
"Bulbs ought to be sowed early in De
cember or in November with a few pansies
or Neapolitan violets among them. Then
when they go out plant with the summer
flowers. All boxes sbouid be six to eight
inches (preferably eight) deep and as wide
jas a window-sill. They should be painted !
I green, as fancy colors detract from the j
flowers. I don't care how fine the paint
is, put flowers alongside and it looks
shabby.
"For pots I would recommend fuchsias,
palms and hardy ferns. The Kentias ana
Phoenix palms are the best, particularly
the Kentia for amateurs. The Cycas cir
cinalis is a very graceful and hardy palm
for windows and stands gas and artifical
lights. Palms should be given a good !
soaking once a week. Put them in a tub

Champion Sprinter.
of water for five minutes and sponge their
leaves, then give them a little water when
they show a dryness. At the same time
look out that you don't 'log' them.
"Only a few people can grow maidenhair
fern. I don't know why. Either they
make the soil too wet or too dry or don't
give the fern a proper light. These ferns
like plenty of light, no sun and lots of
water, but must be well drained. Flower
ing plants, such as begonias and the
others, must be close to the light, ferns in
a corner.
"Hanging-baskets sbouid be treated the
same as window-boxes.' The great trouble
with them is that they are not large
enough, but too shallow. Lobelia, or a
Lady Washington, or any other neat
flower for the center and either a little
German ivy, smilax, ivy geranium or
mesembryanthemum to hang around will
give the most satisfactory result--. It is
best for the amateur not to attempt too
great a variety. With tuese few I have
named you can have floral decorations for
the home that will well repay the trouble
of cultivating them and please the mo3t
lasndious."
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
BaircTs pkilosopkvj of Speed
To be successful in the various depart
ments of athletics requires that one be en
dowed by nature with many attributes.
For one-hundred-yard running one
must have an excessive play of nerve
force, brute strength of muscle, a
good circulation of the blood and
rapidity of thought. The same rules
apply to 220-yard running, except that a
better circulation is required. When a
man begins to feel tired in short-distance
running it means that be is contracting
his muscles so rapidly that the blood can
not pulsato freely through them; and
moreover, it means that the blood cannot
suupJy oxygen to the muscles in sufficient
quantities, hence the heavy feeling in the
leas. During violent exertion there is a
great waste of oxygen in the muscles, and
if this is not quickly renewed a mi:d con
gestion and failure to respond is the re
sult.
When a man is standing on his mark
ready to start he is something more than
a physical being; the mental is BtllLa
very large part of him. When the report
of the pistol reaches his ears it must enter
the cavity of the ear and flash from the
drum to the brain. Then, the Reason
must act, the Will must act, and the forces
in the base of the brain must be released. !
The energy flashes along the nerve chan- j
nels and enters the muscles, expanding *
the cells, which causes the fibers to con- |
tract. Thus, after this process has been ]
accomplished, the runner snoots off his j
mark; but is it not plain to be seen that a !
fraction of a second can be lost by a slug
gish mind being slow to act? To a first
class sprinter every fifth of a second is j
worth two yards, and two yards is the dif
ference between a first and a second class '
runner.
Middle-distance running, or distances
from one-quarter of a mile to three-quar- i
ters, requires a full play of. nerve force, i
but not necessarily as much as in spam <
running; a powerful circulation, a fair i
amount of muscular power and a fine di- <
geslive function.
In the qnartei" mile the most necessary i
quality is circulation. The etrain upon
the heart in pumping and the demand
upon the lungs in revitalizing the vitiated t
blood is tremendous, more so than in any
other race. There must be a fair supply i
of nuisaular strength, as there is a con- !
siderable amount of driving to be done, j <
but the digestive faculties are needed pre- â  ,
viously to the race more than in it. The
characteristic of the mind most required
is a fierce quality of will power. In a half I
oi three-quarter mile racevthe development i
E. B. BLOSS IN THE CROUCH START
of the nerve force, the circulation and the
digestive powers should be about even, as
each and all are required in an eminent
degree in a great runner.
Running from one to three miles, or
distance running, requires still another
class of powers. Of these strength of the
digestive system is the first requisite.
True, the athlete must possess a certain
amount of muscular strength, and he
must have splendid "wind," or he will
i give out in the middle of the contest. He
) will not endure long if this wind, or circu
lation, is not in first-class condition; but I
know from personal experience that a dit
tance race is one Jong agony, with defeat
staring one in the face to increase the tor
| ture, if the stomach and intestines are not
j in perfect condition.
These facts will apply also to distances
from fivo to ten miles. Muscular strength
is reduced to a miniinum, as the strain in
this regard devolves UDon the amount of
nerve forca which the braiu has at com
mand *nd thÂ« action of tbe. blood in re
vitalizing. But in these latter distances
there are two qualities of the mind which
play a great part in successful distance
running. A man may have staminaâ the j
qualities just referred toâ and he may j
have the speed which comes from nerve ;
power, but if all these forces are not '
jruided by judgment and sustained by will i
they amount to very little. Moreover, a i
distance runner's mind must be trained to !
a condition of calm indifference in a race '
or he will lose heart and become if not ut- I
teriy discouraged at least dispirited.
Jumping requires but one special physi
cal attribute as;de from perfect health and
a drilled mindâ nerve force. When the
jumper strikes his foot on t lie ground and !
forces himself in the air the only quality i
required is force and elasticity gained from j
a little muscular strength and a great 1
deal of nervous energy. There is no vital |
strength required and no stamina what- j
ever. Thus the strong points of a runner j
are easily summed up. But the jumper
must introduce into tliis event an amount
of study and hard work that is required in
only a few lines of physical activity.
Hurdling requires great muscular power,
nerve force and a powerful circulation.
These are the physical attributes. In addi- '
tion the hurdler must possess a cool htad, !
a quick response to the pisftol, and to be ]
truly successful must reduce hurdling to a j
science, as a middle distance runner would
never think of doing.
Walking requires great muscular power, j
particularly the mile, and a strong flow of i
nervous energy. For this distance the j
circulation must be keyed up to the high
est point and the digestive function in
perfect order. Moreover the judgment
must be well trained that the greatest pos- '
sible speed ma/ be developed and ex- J
haubtiou not set in before the race is !
over. Beyona a mile the necessity of 1
nerve force decreases, but the demand on
the stomach and bowels is greater. In a
severe contest, and particularly on a warm
day, the whole internal organism be
fomes*heated, and if one is not in tine con
dition in this respect it makes no differ
ence how good his "wind" or how mnch
nerve power he may have, he must alow
down or stop altogether.
Bicyclingâ Many of onr readers will j
naturally inquire, What is required to be
a^ast bicycler?
Bicycling! I am free to adroit that I
approach this subject with hesitancy, not
to say reluctance, though I have been an
observer of bicycling ever since I saw
Johnson win the championship for two
miles in 1880, and that was "the cham
pionship" then, the only contest of its
kind held. Until 1886 I witnessed about
all the great meets and circuit races at
Washington, Philadelphia, New York,
Hartford, New Haven. Springfield, Buf
falo and Montreal. One of my brothers
. has been a track and road rider for twelve
years, and last, even if least, I am a rider
myself, f.tid believe it to be the beau ideal
of exercise.
I mention these facts because 1 am go
ing to make a statement that the first
requisite to success in bicycling, aud par
ticularly in the short distances, is to learn
the "trick." What thai trie* is Ido not
know, but I believe in its existence. It is
a rare indeed almost unknown thing for a
new man at running, walking, jumping
or hurdling to b? beaten by an unknown
and green athlete on his first public ap
pearance, yet I have seen this occur in
bicycling more than once to my disgust.
Whatever the trick is it must be ac
quired before the rider can hope to be suc
cessful. The next requisite of importance
is nerve force. The rider must have a
great deal of this as well as a powerful
j circulation.
In longer distances there in less nerve
orce required, and less powerful circula
tion; but there mast be corresponding
strength In; the stomach and intestine*,
and much more judgment. In short dis
tances, such as a quarter and 4 half mile,
the wheelman requires considerable
muscular power to drive the machine
ahead at high pressure. I speak of this
in distinction to nervous energy, which
might exist and develop great speed, even
thongh the rider might not be able to bear
a jircat strain without danger of the
muscle actually giving wayâ an accident
that sometimes happens to sprint runners.
Let us consider some living illustrations
of these theories that 1 have advanced.
I will mention one well known among
athletes and their admirers six years ago,
V. E. Schefferstein. In the light of what
has already been Raid, it is not difficult for
one who knew this ereat athlete to com
prehend the source of his truly wonderful
powers. Although the young man wore
an expression of apparent calmness on his
face, a close observer could easily detect
evidences of extreme nervousness within.
In fact, he was a mass of nerves; he waÂ«
all nerve?. His running was the effect of
an unlimited and ready supply of nervous
energy, which acted with such force and
elasticity upon the muscles as to make
them so much indiarubber for the time
being. If this was so in sprint running
how much more was it In jumping, when
all that tremendous force was concen
trated in the leap from the scratcii line.
But Schefferstein was utterly lacking in
the qualities that make an a.'l-round ath;
let*; for, while I presume his lung-power
was pood, it was certain that his digestive
function was in poor condition. He has
told me many things concerning his vital
organs that caved me to wonder how on
earth he could ever run at all; which con-
PETER D. SKILLMAN, One-Mile Record, 4 Minutes 30 Seconds
vinced me still more tbat his running was
from his wonderful nervous energy.
P. E. Skillman was one of the best dis
tance runners on the coast and at one time
five-mile champion of America. He pos
sesses little nervous energy, attested by
the fact tbat he has not been successful ct
short distances, but is gifted with splen
did circulation and digestive powers.
Thew two combined, together with judg
ment and perseveranceâ qualities of the
mindâ constitute what is generally called
stamina. This quality he certainly pos
sessed and a larga share of the mental at
tributes just mentioned. Moreover be
waa what is called a "consistent" runner,
that is, more than most runners he could
be depended upon. This latter quality
generally comes from the athlete
studying himself thoroughly, becom
ing familiar with his physical pe
culiarities, watching the diet and
refusing tbe cravings of the .appetite for
forbidden fruits. It was on these points
that Hkillman was strong and therefore
"consistent."
Howard Coffin, the half-mile runner,
runs from his nervous energy and his
strong circulation. His muscular pdwer
is not considerable and his digestive de
partment is not strong. In a punishing
race his stomach and intestines would not
respond.
Fred Koch is a different man, possessing
a great deal of muscular power and a
strong stomach. His circulation is power
ful and the mental qualities required of a
middle-distance runner are at his com
mand.
Robert Mac Arthur, the ex-champion
mile runner on this coast, has little nerv
ous energy, but .a strong set of vital or
gan?, particularly the heart and stomach.
His judgment also is excellent.
W. U. Henry, the hurdl* racer, who at
ono time held the record of the world for
the 120-yard hurdle race, combines tbe
qualities of ir.ind and body in work at his
favorite distance. He reduced his prac
tice to a science (see my letteron hurdling),
is gifted with powerful limbs, gains much
from the rapid play of nerve lorce, and
from a strong circulation.
David Brown, the mile runner, beside"
having a cool head, gains his power largely
from a lusty circulation and a fine diges
tive apparau, â¢. As before remarked, these
points constitute stamina. Many men
can run like deer, but cannot endure the
strain of a long race.
I have not had the pleasure of meeting
Patterson, the high jumper, but presume
that he achieves success by reason of his
nerve power, and, what must not be for
gotten, by having acquired the "knack. "
F. F. Foster, the broad jumper and
hurdler, gains bis prowess by reason of
muscular power, nerve force and a power
ful circulation.
Horace Coffin, the walker, rose to suc
ce?s by untiring perseverance and hard
work. His muscular strength was prob
ably natural ; but the nerve power, heart
power and vital strength â otherwise
known as staminaâ displayed, in the mile
championship of 1891 were to a large de
gree acquired, and therefore more to his
credit.
In conclusion allow me to say that I
trust none of my readers will fail to read
my letter in last Sunday's issue, as it gives
the key to many remarks in this article
that would be otherwise difficult to under
stand. George D. Baird.

There in always a danger that tbe ama
teur athlete, of whichever sex, may come
to regard exercise and the performance of
difficult feats of strength and agility as in
themselves desirable. To read what most
writers have to say upon the subject, al
most any one might be jus'iitied in coming
to that conclusion. Nevertheless, it it a
mistake ever to regard physical culture as
anything else ihun one means to a distinct
end, and that end tbe highest development
of the human being.
For this reason there is something rather
deplorable in the tendency of the day
toward specialization in athletic sports.
The man or woman who follows one focru
of exercise is apt to do so to the exclusion
of ali others. Whoso rides a wheel scorns
Indian clubs and horseback-riding. The
owner of a good saddle-horse laughs at
the idea that walking can put p.n addi
tional finish to his physical development.
And the woman who puts in three or four
hours a week at a gymnasium is hard to
convince that she is not doing all that is
necessary for the symmetrical develop
ment cf a healthy body.
As a general thing it may be laid down
as a rule that any form of exercise that
can be taken without set apparatus is
preferable to that which calls for such.
There is apt to be more spontaneity
about it, and the purposeful volition
of the individual enters into tbe
act as it cannot when the exercise
depends upon mechanical contrivances.
For this reason calisthenics is a belter
form of exercise than club-swinging;
walking when one is in training is bet
ter than riding, whether one mounts
horse, or wheel, and definite ex
peditions to attain some end are
more wholesome than mere walking for
exercise. We are too apt, in set ways with
apparatus, to think of the work itself. We
devote so many moments to clubs, so
many to weights and pulleys. So many
trips up and down the ladder constitute
our daily "stint" and we come to regard our
exercise as a task instead of a pleasure.
I have spoken several times of th*
urgent need for systematical development.
Women perhaps even more than men are
apt to develop the two sides of the body
uuequaily. They usually begin at an
earlier age forming the habits that de
termine development. It is not as a rule
hampering skirts, improper clothing and
tight shoes that make so many of our
women ungraceful in carriage and unequal
to great exertion. It is lack of uniformity
in the two sides of the body.
The school boys and girls of that much
governed country, Russia, have recently
been made the subject of some queer
legislation. They are required by law to
sleep upon their backs, and in the Balkan
provinces an officer in every district has it
a<s his especial charge to see that they do
it. Ln going to and from school they are
also required to carry their books and
other impediments upon their backs. At
first glance it seems as though this were
carrying oilicial interference to the
furthest extreme, yet there is a good
deal of wisdom in the requirement. The
sleeping habits of a creature are of the
greatest importance.
You can almost always tell, by close ob
servance of a human being, which side he
sleeps on at night and the habit most of
us have of lying almost always upon the
same side is productive of a good deal of
mischief. The muscles of the lower side
are subjected to undue pressure. The lung
of that side does no work and the various
other organs come, in time, to adjust
themselves to tbe habitual position in
which we rest. When disease attacks ua
that side is the first affected.
Now, what rest does for the body, in a
passive way, exercise does still more, and
actively. Whatever are our daily habits,
their tendency is to develop certain mus
cles to the exclusion of others. This
sounds like a truism, and yet, like many
another truism, it seems necessary that it
be often repeated. Almos: every woman
who takes up any form of exercise se
lects what she does best and with the
greatest ease. As a matter of fact, this is
exactly what ought not to be done. If we
perform any physical act with ease and
dexterity, it is because the muscles
brought into play by it are already in
good training, and the thing to be done is
to bring some other set into as useful trim.
The woman who can walk miles with
out fatigue should walk, but she should
also take such exercise as tends to de
velop the muscles of the arms and chest.
For such the clubs, fencing and the
Swedish movements are very useful.
Whatever is done care should be
taken .that both sides of the body
are exercised. It may be necessary to
devote special attention for a long time to
one set of muscles, but the effort should
be persisted in until the left arm is as
strong, the left hand as dextrous and the
left leg takes as long a stride as the right.
This harmonious development is the end
of all training.
Prevalent opinion to the contrary, work
is not exercise. The farm laborer is rarely
an athlete. '
His muscles are usually hard and un
manageable, save for the performance of
a particular set of tasks. His gait is hard
and inelastic and he is more than likely to
be muscle-bound across the neck and
shoulders. For such a man the military
drill does wonders and it would be a good
thing for future generations if wo could
have something similar for women, in
particular for women who work, which is
equivalent to saying for nearly all women.
About 79 per cent of tbe women of the
United states do their own housework,
and the majority of them are apt to im
agine that thus they obtain all necessary
exercise. No mistake could be greater.
If the belief were founded upon fact we
would have a race of athletic mothers
which we are far from having.
But here in California, where the con
ditions are so much more favorable than
almost anywhere else, we sbouid have
more perfect specimens of physical woman
hood than we see. With "all out of doors"
so easily attainable; with a climate that
renders exertion a pleasure, nearly every
day in the. year, and with a hundred things
close at hand to take us out of ourselves
and into the wholesome common con
sciousness of things, we should not find iU,
diih'cuit to attain a better all-round devel
opment than we have yet arrived at.

WKvj Does tke Educated American Qirl Prefer Poverty to Domestic Service?
Why do educated American girls object
to going out as housemaids, and accept
instead more poorly paid employment?
Being a teacher, I have had leisure in
the summer-time to investigate the matter,
and I have found so many whys that I
thought I would write them down for ref
erence.
Vacation had come, and buoyed up by
tbe freshness of a June morning and a
high and mighty resolve, 1 entered, for
the first time in my life, an employment,
office.
"What kind of a Â«irl do you wish,
madam?"
A most entrancing thrill vibrated from
the tremendous aigrette in my fetching
little capote to the tips of my French Kid
shoes. For the space of several seconds
my soul was translated. The being be
fore me was deference personified. What
depth of discernment, what true apprecia
tion. He spat upon the floor and marked
the spot by a sweeping emphasis of bis
boot heel over the faded oilcloth. My
spirit returned to earth. The being be
fore me was stroking his dingy yellow
whiskers and had resumed the mastica
tion of his quid of tobacco, while his weak
eyes were blinking at me in an indifferent
expectant fashion. With an effort mightier
than my resolve had anticipated I forced
myself to reveal to him the truth.
"H'ni, nursery-governess or second
work, etc.? Teach French and music, and
understand sewin r ? There ain't many
calls for them governesses. Got some
places for second work; tony families,
too. I can send you to one up on the
next street now. Five in the family,
washin' mostly put out, take care of the
children, wait on table, etc., Chinese
cook â "
"Would â would they expect me to eat
in the kitchen?" I inquired faintly. "I
reckon. Them aristocratic families gen
er'ly do." "I â I think I would rather be
in a smaller family," I faltered.
I pictured myself vis-a-vis with an al
mond-eyed Celestial manipulating his na
tive chopsticks, and heard the tintinnabu
lations of madame's bell in the dining
room and 1 marveled anew at our
American "lack of social distinctions."
"Well, in small families, you know, it's
mostly general housework .girls that's
wanted â for cookin', specially. There

Jke J^leW J^ropKet of Sarv Lorer\zo Greek and j\\s Grazy Graft or\ the JMud Flats
Prophet Herbert Smith sailed into the
mouth of the San Lorenzo Creek, south of
Alameda, a few days ago and, like Noah
and the ark; landed on high ground and
was left there by the receding tide.
Smith is one of the queer characters of
the b;iy; the queerest, perhaps, that ever
sailed its waters, for he navigates a big
sloop without a rudder and with a tiny
rag of canvas for a sail and yet comes to
no harm and seems to live a happy life
aboard his crazy vessel.
He was a follower of the Oakland
spiritualistic medium who married Count
Fastijerna de Poulson, the erratic Swed
ish nobleman of Peterboff Castle and as
the Countess Poulson claimed his prop
erty. When her circle broke up after she
had acquired much of this world's goods
Smith started out to preach her creed â a
combination of many isms.
He claimed to have received a divine
command to purchase a vessel and preach
from her deck when the crowds that he
expected to congregate at the sound of
his roice pressed too closely about him.'
With strange incongruity he bought a
craft called the Southern Pacific and per
mits her to carry that cognomen on her
stern to this day. There are those who
think that Smith believes all he says about
the divine instigation for his eccentric, life,
while others think he is just a plain faKir,
but be that as it may Smith (claims to be a
prophet of the first water and finds no-dif
ficulty in gaining a large audience when
ever he appoints an hour to expound his
doctrines.
Since it has been noised about that
Smith has found a resting-place the be
lievers in the teachings of the Countess
Poulson have flocked to him as her suc
cessor, and his followers daily increase in
numbers. They come from Berkeley, Oak
land, San Leandro, Lorin, Alameda, and
even from the City, and congregate about
the boat, some sitting on the sand to lis
ten, while others stand about the sides

and cookin' herself. Just wants somebody
that don't go gallivantin' 'round of an
evenin'; to take care o' the young ones.
HusDand's away most alwaysâ very quiet
place."
And with this covert slap at his own
sex and an ignoring of madame's evident
propensity for "gallivanting 'round" her
self of an evening, to tbe neglect of her
offspring, he opened a large and dirty
register to lmd her address.
"Never mind." I said hastily. "I'll call
again when there are more to choose
from." But I never did. "No followers
allowed" was too insulting an insinuation
to be countenanced by a staid school
ma'am.
A few days later, when I had recovered
somewhat from the shock of this first en
counter, I betook myself to a suburban
village, in response to a call for "an in
telligent girl to assist with housework and
make herself one of tbe family." Un
fortunately it was the easy-going pater
familias who had undertaken to make the
arrangements, and his information was of
a very indefinite character. He beguiled
the brief railway jonrney with assurances
of a pleasant life beneath his roof. His
wife was a great worker, a most attractive
woman; he knew I would like her. His
son was a model boy, carried off all the
prizes at school, and "the others'' â well,
they made no trouble;
I found ma'dame to be a small wiry per
son with sallow complexion, cold, grey
eyes and short locks, which curled up
ward about her collar like a series of
fishhooks. She was possessed of fair in
telligence, a penurious disposition and a
passion for art, and while her grammar
was deplorable she made a point of quot
ing Voltaire and otherwise displaying her
culture. Among the "light duties" I had
to perform were cooking, sweeping, scrub
bing floors and washing.
Milady's artistic sensibilities were ever
uppermost, and tbe way in which I hung
the clothes upon the line pained her so
mncb that she changed them all about,
placing the sheets so as to occupy all the
room possible, pinning the stockines other
end up, and arranging the underwear in
esthetic groups, whose inspiring effect
was, I confess, quite lost upon me. Her
two old bachelor brothers boarded with
herâ remarkably stupid fellowÃ both, who
ate with their knives and rarely spoke at
table. One was deaf and very crusty,
while the other was oppressively obliging,
coming into the kitchen of an evening to
drinking in the words as they flow from
the lips of the prophet.
When a sufficient number has assem
bled on a Sunday morning he begins his
discourse, which often lasts for hours, ex
horting his hearers to believe in him and
be saved from tne many dangers that
beset life.
If a sufficient crowd assembles in the af
ternoon, lie holds a second service for the
edification of the respectful and admiring
crowd, which, as a general thing, is com
posed almost entirely of women, a mascu
line face showing here and there.
The service over, be requests an offering,
and when the contributions have all been
nanded up over the side of the boat,
aboard of which none are allowed to pass,
he pronounces a benediction and retires
with dignified mien to the seclusion of his
cabin.
The burden of Proobet Smith's song is
that he is delegated to save the lives of
thousands through his gift of prophecy
and the souls of all through his ability to
foretell the dangers that will beset their
paths. At the same time he lays more
stress on his alleged ability as a life-saver
than bis soul-saving powers.
"If people would only come to me," he
said a few days ago, as he stood on the
rail of the Southern Pacific and gazed with
reflective eyes at the sand that surrounds
her, "I could save them a heap of trouble.
I have foretold disasters that have oc
curred on land and water"â with a vague
wave of the handâ "and everything has
come out just as I said. How do I get the
knowledge? Why, from tbe angels, of
course.

PROPHET SMITH ADDRESSING THE MULTITUDE FROM THE* DECK OF HIS QUEER VESSEL
On a suggestion being made that his 1
allotted three score years and ten must be
about up he said:
Jke Poet Bums as a Mystic of tke Fields .
The centenary of the death of Robert Burns
on July 21 last evoked even more enthusiasm
than the centenary of his birthday, thirty,
seven years ago.
Any attempt to reconsider Burns' character,
even in the light of many new facts bearing
on his career and influencing his actions, must
be left to others, and a mere rechauffee of the
vast volume of critical "estimates" would be,
even were we equal to the task, a work of
supererogation. Our aim is the more humble
one of reviewing his works from an almost
totally neglected standpoint, and, approxi
mately at least, fixing his position in the
hierarchy of that beautiful cult, poetry, in its
relationship to the phenomena of animal life,
and more particularly the life-habits of fami
liar birds.
From that standpoint Burns holds a unique
position. He was the very first of our gfeat
field-naturalist poets, and he holds that posi
tion by virtue of the simplicity and fidelity of
all his allusion?, while his most passionate
lines and verses are deeply inspired by that
strange and mysteriqus spirit of pure esoteric
totemism, for the origin and deeper meaning
of which we have to go very deep down in the
history of human evolution. His genius was'
wholly uninfluenced by the charms of "animal
myth" and symbolism, embalmed In the writ
ings of nearly all onr great poets, and more
particularly in the works of the great dramat
ists of the Elizabethan and post-Elizabethan
ages. He communed with varying aspects of
natural life and 'inanimate nature, and these
reacted on his emotions and found expression |
in many incomparably touching verses. As a
poet of nature Burns, therefore, stands in his
solitary glory midway between the refined and
cultured embodiment of far-off totemism and
mere elemental mysticism and the sublime
transcendentalism of the nature cult of Words
worth.
There are few of Burns' more passionate and
familiar lyrics devoid ot the spirit of inter
communial sympathy with natural phenom
ena In various aspects and in their relation
ship to various moods. In "To Mary in
Heaven" we find:
The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar
Twin'd am'rous round the raptur'd scene.
A very beautiful and appropriate image ex
quisitely expressed, and the idea is heightened
and gracefully amplified in the lines that fol
low:
Tbe flowers ajirangr'wanton to be prest.
The birds sang love on ev'ry spray.
By way of contrast what could be more im

nursing-bottle and a battered dustpan.
The floor was covered with odd bits of
matting, and the window had no curtain.
II needed none, however, for the mud of
several winters deposited upon its outer
surface by an ill-directed gutter-spout
rendered it almost opaque. The bed had
evidently been used as a throne of state
for the baby, while his mother worked in
the adjoining kitchen. Upon retfring I
"That's all right, but time does not
bother me. I shall be back here at the
end of 1000 years in this cralt to preach to
those who wish to hear me. In 3000 years 1
I shall De back again just as you see me 1

thor's Farewell to his Native Country," begin
ning with
The gloomy night Is gath'rlng fast
Loud roars the wild inconstant blast:
Or more beautiful than the interwoven im
ages and feelings in "My Nannie's Awa'," or
that still more perfect (for illustrative pur
posei) "The Banks o' Doon:"
Te banks and braes o' bonnie Doon,
How eÂ«n ye bloom sac fresh aad fair?
Bow can ye chant, ye little birds,
And I sac weary, fu' o' care?
Thou 'lt break my heart, thou warbling bird,
That wantons thro' tbe flowering thorn
Thou minds me o' departed Joys-
Departed never to return.
Oft hae I rov'd by bonnie Doon
To see the rose and wooibine twine.
And ilka bird sang o' Its love.
And fondly â¢,Â»Â«â  did I o' mine
Wr lightsome heart I pud a rose
Ku' sweet upon Us thorny tree;
And my fause lover stole the rose,
But ah he left the thorn wi* me.
We must turn, however, from that very
pleasing aspect of Burns' poetry to view it in
Its more unique relationship to the familiar
aspects and even obscure phenomena' of bird
life, and in this respect it makrs an absolutely
new departure in the evolution of English
verse. Burns was tborouehly familiar with
the part played by myth and classicism in the
"rustic poetry" of his predecessors, and in the
references to particular birds in the works of
| our greatest writers. These he did not de
spise, but they had no influence on his mind,
as expressed in his verse. He did for
birds, through his poems, what White of
Selborne did by his immort&i letters to Dames
Barrington and Thomas Pennant, and in
every one of his direct and mere casual refer
ences he was quite as faithful to the absolute
verities of nature as tlie first of English field
naturalists. A very few examples must suffice.
I have marked fifteen passages referring to
larks' in his poems, not one of which but bears
the stamp of observant fidelity, and in the
verses to the woodlttrk(Alaudaarborea)â which
was more common in Ayrshire in the poet's
day and for many years afterward than is gen
erally supposedâ there is a very effective
blending of the human emotions with the
purely physical charms of avinn song:
Say, was thy little mate unkind
And heard thee as the careless wind?
Oh, nocht but lovÂ« and sorrow join'd,
Sic notes o' wae could waullcen.
The references to the no less familiar robin
| red breastare not many in Burns' poems, but
straightened out the
tangle of bedding,
and drawing off the
pillow-slip subs ti
tuted a clean towel
from my valise. This
proceeding greatly
angered the little
frau, but I was firm.
She still did part of
the cooking herself,
well knowing that
her lord's " chief
thought was for his
stomach, and that the
mysteries of bis taste
were' not to be com
prehended by a
stranger.
After getting things
into shape for dinne
and giving me un
grammatical direc
tions for dishing up,
she whisked off her
apron and with
flushed face tripfld
away to join her hus
band in the dining
room, where she en
joyed ringing tbe call
bell almost as much
as little August.
After sweeping the
house, doing a two
weeks' washing,
cleaning the windows
and breaking tbe
globe of the parlor
lamp (for which I
prpraptly forfeited
half a week's wages),
1 told meine frau that
"light housework"
was not my forte and
I rose and departed
thence.
My next mistress
was a thorough going
New England house
keeper, who kept
fashionable table boarders and supported a
sickly and disreputable-looking husband.
His claims to gentility were evidenced by
a lengthy English pedigree, carefully
framed and hung over the dining-room
mantel, and by a rusty silk hat which he
nonchalantly cocked dyer one eye whf.n he
was sent out to do the marketing.
"Missus'' did all the cooking and a
thousand other things as well, while I
my soul will be there just â¢'â 
Juat then a new crowd of % -nls
' came down the narrow bi . . d*
from toe Bay Farm Island bridge, and he
rose to greet them, cutting the interview
short.
all of them are instinct with the perfect
vraisemblance of pure field naturalism, the
following from the "Brigs of Ayr" being abso
lutely perfect:
Nao.mair the grove with ajrjr concert rings,
Except, perhaps, the robin's whisking glee.
Proud o' the hwxht o' tome bit half lang tree;
Or this from the closing lines of the "Epistle
of Robert Graham:
so, when the storm Â»he forest rends
The robin in the hedge descends
And sober chirps securely.
The thrush, or "mavis," as the bird Is
euphoniously termed in Scotland, is referred
to many times; never in one jarring note of
inconsistency with its dally habits. Some
times it is
The mellow thrush
Hailing tbe setting snn, sweet In the green thorn
bush;
Or this to the Missel-thrush, now a scarcer
bird in Ayrshire than when Burns penned the
famous sonnet "On Hearing a Thrush Sing
in c morning walk in January 25, 1793," the
birthday of the author:
Sing on, sweet thrush, upon the leafless bough;
Sing on, sweet bird, I listen to thy strain;
See, aged winter, 'mid his surly reltn
At thy b'ythe carol clears hi* furrow'd brow.
Burns is never tempted into the realm of
myth and gloomy ominous superstition even
in his references to the ravenâ all his passages
are strictly on natural history lines and all
are singularly exact and faithful to the verities
of raven nature. When John Anderson's
Bonnie brow was brent
His locks were like the raven.
And the evil reputation of the bird as a sea.
shore scourge (or shall we not, in preference,
say tne libelous character of the bird, for as a
matter of fact, it is rather a beneficial scaven
ger of garbage than a scourge) is referred to in
one couplet only of the poem "Caledonia" :
The fell harpy raven took wing from the north.
The scourge of tbe seas and the dread of the shore.
The common bit tern (Botaurus Stellarls) is,
I believe, quite extinct in Ayrshire as a breed
ing b.rd, but it was very different in Burns'
day, and although considerable ignorance pre
vails as to the natural habits of this bird,
Burns' references to it are again those of an
observant naturalist. The whole of the
"Elegy on Captain Matthew Henderson" ig In
stinct with the inspiration of poetic sympathy
with natural phenomena in their relationship
to human feelings.
Forty odd years ago, when bitterns were not
so uncommon in the "Mosgiel country" of
Ayrshire, the bird was popularly termed "the
swept, scrubbed floors, prepared vege
tables and washed countless dishes. In
answer to the usual question I informed
the hostess that my "front name" was
"Lenore." ' It was a whim of mine never
to tell the truth in this matter, for the
name my mother had given me I held too
sacred to be bandied about by strangers.
A new installment of hungry youths had
just arrived for dinner, and the flustrated
landlady bustled. into \he kitchen with the
despairing announcement that the house
was being disgraced and that "Abner
must get a move on" and help her out.
"Abner" followed with an ice-pitcher and
his customary sneer.
"Hello, Len!" he said, elbowing his way
to the sink beside me to draw some water.
1 hastily made roam for him and forced
myself to utter a civil "good evening."
"Ain't got time to say such a long name,
you know," be added, with a leer, as he
stroked his ragged mustache, and turn
ing his fishy gray eyes contemptuously
upon his impatient wife, he -moved away
to do her bidding. I stood within three
feet of the broiling hot range for hours at
my work. The young heir of the house
passed me a number of times, bowling
anathemas upon my defenseless head for
presuming to make myeelf so much at
home without having considered his dis
like of strangers, and once even kicked me
to enforce bra unheeded observations. The
marked attention which his case then re
ceived, however, caused him to stand, or
rather to sit, in profound awe of my dis
ciplinary " powers and he thenceforth left
me undisturbed.
Boarders came and went ; the indefatig
able landlady hastened ceaselessly to and
fro, while her leisurely husband served up
icecream and cynical remarks, and I was
now and then called from my dishes to
assist in waiting.
A partially demented widow who lodged
in the back bedroom came into the kitchen
and asted if I would "comb her head"
when I got through my work. I declined
the honor, and the next day she asked the
landlady if she didn't think it was I who
had stolen her breastpin.
The trundle-bed allotted to me was in a
garret at the head of the Kitchen stairs,
with no door between, and the uncur
tained skylights added to the intolerable
beat. But I found that this was a para
dise when compared with the quarters as
signed to many servant girls. In a small,
second-class hotel I was given not a room,
but a closet, with actually no openings
The ark on top of Mount Ararat could
not have presented a much stranger sight
than does Prophet Smith's craft as she lies
in lonely state on a spit near the mouth of
Seal Creek, her stem in the mud and her
bow buried deep in the sand.
Originally she was a solidly bui'.t bay
freighter, but was driven out of the trade
by the steamers that now ply the inland
waters after she had lost ber mast in a
collision. Now she presented as battered
and foriorn a look as any old hulk in Rot
ten Row, and the greatest wonder is that
she floats at all.
When she passed into the possession of
her present owner he concluded that
without a mast she would hardly pass for
a ship, so he had a huge ladder full fifty
feet long hoisted amidship and stayed by
a single rope from the bow and one from
each side. To prevent it from falling stern
ward another ladder braces it, and from
this Prophet Smith tells of the things
that are to come.
During his travels at the mercy of the
wind and tide Smith has accumulated a
queer lot of small boats that cumber his
deck ot cluster about the stern, and on the
top of the cabin rests the stern half of a
ship's boat covered with, odd pieces of
greasy cany.as, while against one bulwark
stands a battered skiff that no human inge
nuity could ever repair. Astern, floating
forlornly at the end of a ragged painter, is
a boat that looks as though she might
once have served as tender to a Chinese
junk-
Odds and ends of lumber and empty
fruitboxea litter the deck and dusty hold
in which no cargo has floated for many
years. Even his anchors are patched
with scraps of iron bound on with wire
and rope and the chain cables are rust
eaten and fragile looking.
The Southern Pacific with her strange
rig and stranger crew floated into the
creek one bright June moaning, no one
knew whence, and Prophet Smith called
bull o' the bog," and sometimes the "mire
drum." owing to its nocturnal cries, which"
Burns must have heard. Leyden, in his
"Scenes of Infancy," has a couplet that has
quite a Burnsiana ring about it:
No more the screaming bittern, bellowing harsh,
To Its dark bottom shakes the shuddering marsh.
There is here, but not in Burns' lines, con
fusion of adjectives, the effect of inexact per
sonal observation, the cry of the bittern being
undoubtedly of the "bellowing" kinaâ rairing,
as Burns correctly phrases it, bnt it is a con
tradiction in terms to apply to it "screaming"
and "harsh" in the same line. Burns' refer
ence to the eel-angling exploits of tbe common
but tbe door, which led into a dark and
narrow side-entry off the main hall. No
breath of fresh air could reach it, and the
foul old kerosene lamp which illumined it
rendered the musty atmosphere absolutely
sickening.
To add to the horrors-of the night which
a pouring rain forced me to pass there I
was inflicted with a roommate, the Swed
ish laundress, whose coarse talk and un
cleanly person were repulsive in the ex
treme. The mistress of the establishment,
who seemed well pleased with my first
day's 'vyorK, was much disconcerted that I
should '-drop off so suddint," before she
bad time to secure another girl. For my
part I resolved never to accept another
engagement, however brief, without first
seeing my room.
Upon interviewing the proprietress of a
fashionable private boarding-house I re
quested this privilege and was conducted
up devious bacK stairways to an entry
opening upon a covered porch, where
were ranged the toilet-rooms. Judging
from the foul odors sanitary plumbing
was regarded as a superfluous luxury, and
it was in direct connection with these
apartments that the servants' rooms had
been built.
Not even plastered walls intervened,
only thin board partitions, each room being
dimly lighted by an opening as high and
narrow as a prison grating. As I entered
one of these cells, a slender girl with dark
circles under her eyes and paint on her
cheeks hastily rose, and gathering up the
hair combings from her dressing-table,
resumed the task of packing her few pos .
sessions in a valise.
Where was she going? The commonest
beer-ball would afford more healthful ac
commodations than were offered here, and
as she turned to leave so-called lespect
ability behind, I felt a strange sympathy
for her. If our laws regarding the mat
ter of sanitary inspection were as good as
those in some parts of Europe, and thÂ«
average mistress were a little less con
scienceless, fewer American girls would
object to going out to service.
I know, of course, that there is another
side to this story. There are mistresses
and mistresses, as there are maids and
maids. I have in mind a friend who is
servant in a family where the conditions
are ideal. She is treated as one of the
family, and the family is cultured. But
really, the ideal is not often found. I did
not find it. Miss Pedagogue.
] upon the bridge-tender to open the draw
I bridge that he might sail through to an
anchorage. The guardian of the bridge
refused to permit the sailing through fear
that the structure might be injured, but
ordered the Southern Pacific laid along
side the dolphin and warped tnrough, an
operation that was performed after much
difficulty and many pious exclamations
on the part of Smith and much mild pro
fanity on the part of the bridge-tender.
Once inside, the nueer craft veered over
to the southern shore of the estuary and
went on the point in the high spring tide.
Smith made no effort to get her off,
being content to lie there for the time
being and believing that the big tides of
the present month would take him off. In
this he was disappointed, for the highest
of the July tides failed to budge the South
ern Pacific and she will be compelled to lie
quiet in her sandy bed until the June tides.
"She is in need of repairs," he says,
"and I shall have plenty of time to prepare
for my next voyage, which may be to
China for all I know. I shall go wherever
the Lord steers my bark."
Smith's personal appearance is not out
of keeping with his vessel, for be might
easily be mistaken for the Ancient Mari
ner or Mohammed, by whose whiskers the
Moslem swears. An ample white beard
flows down over his chest, while keen
dark eyes 1 ook from under eyebrows that
have been plentifully touched by the frosta
of time.
In stature he is powerful and of about
medium height, the sixty-five or seventy
â¢winters that have passed over his head
not having bent his form to any noticeable
extent.
He seldom leaves his old craft except to
buy provisions, and early and late can be
see working about her, patching here,
tinkering there, getting ready, for that
coming voyage which from the appear
ance of the vessel might well be predicted
to be her last.
heron (Ardea Cinerca) is very remarkable, as
it is only within the last few years trained
ornithologists have come to a right frame of
mind as to the exact feeding habits of this
bird, and a good many "popular" writers and
"literary anglers" are still in a condition of
utter darkness, and do not know that herans
are beneficial rather than hurtful in the
neighborhoo dof trout streams. Burns, of
course, has many references to the habits of
many other species ot common birds; too
numerous to record even by the barest refer
ence, but these all go to confirm our original
contention that he was the first and most
gifted of field naturalist poets.

This is the season wnen all torrents run
Beneath no bri?hx, glad beauty of the sun.

Greeting !
I hope you all agree with me (but how
could you help it?) that the stories pub

Isn't it strange how differently we look
at everything in life and how much may
be wr;tten about one thing?
Your editor is glad that you've been
given this work to do â studying pictures.
Keep if up. Never glance at a picture
carelessly. Remember always the fair
future which lies before California chil

through the lands where lived and worked
the greatest artists of the world's history;
and perhaps gaze on their marvelous pro
ductions.
Your keen enjoyment of these beautiful
pictures and statues may in a large meas
ure be due to your study of detail sug
gested by your own "Childhood's

One word more â a word worth while:
To-day following my greeting to you is
a 6imple little story about one with whom
I wish you to be acquainted.
In the future I shall question you about
him, so read his story carefully. He's
worthy of our love; therefore learn of his
wonderful career.

The new arrival, Downeyhead.
To-day at dawn I stole aloft,
And there it lay, so warm, so soft
And I made bold with what I saw
To gently touch it with my paw.
They sent me off disgraced, forlorn,
The saddest pussy ever born.
About the dwelling to and fro
The busy footsteps come and go.
Low voices chatter everywhere,
A joy there seems in all the ah*.
But no, one heeds my sorry lot;
I am forsaken and forgot
Yes (ah, no wonder that I'm blue),
My supper is forgotten, too !

SIMON
BOLIVAR
fl Stor\j of the Washington of
South America.
Written for Tiny Boys and Girl*.
â â â
Come, children, one and all, and I shall
tell to you the story of a little boy who
became the hero and liberator of his
country.
You all know what '-'hero" means, I ;
am sure, and, maybe, you all strive to be
one, but how many of you know what
".liberator" means?
We II, ever and ever so many years aco â
yes, more than a hundred (that's long
before you and 1 were players and workers
on this lovely earth, is it not?)â a little
baby boy came to gladden the beautiful j
home of the noble Juan Vicente Bolivar y |
Ponte and bis sweet wife.
They lived in the picturesque city of
Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, in
South America. As this tiny baby grew
to manhood and became the deliverer j
and father of his country, his birthday, j
July 24â the one hundred and thirteenth
anniversary being last Friday â is cele
brated throughout the South American
republic, just as we celebrate Washing
ton's birthday.
Day by day, under the watchful care of
his parents, this baby, who bad been
named Simon, grew into a bright and
sturdy lad who liked to read as much as
you do, John, or romp and play as you,
Tom.
After going to school and learning all he
cGuld at home, Simon was sent to travel
and study in Europe.
He attended college in Madrid, the capi
tal of Spain, where he lived for several
years. When he had finished bis college
education he traveled in France, and
reached Paris In time to witness the Jaat
scenes of the French Revolution. Here he
first learned of freedom.
Returning to Madrid he married a beau
tiful and noole lady, and with his bride
returned to bis home in Venezuela, in
tending to pass the rest of his life on his
fine estate.
But soon after they landed his young
and pretty wife died of yellow fevar, and
Simon sailed again for Europe to try and
forget his sorrow in change of scene.
Before his return to his own country he
visited the United States, which was then
but a few years old, being but a short time
after the close of our Revolutionary War
and our independence of our mother
country, England, had been declared.
Simon became very much interested in
the United States and in tne story of how
she became a free and independent Nation.
Ho also became interested in George
Washington, who had died a few years be
fore, and whose name was tipon every
one's lips and whose image was engraved
in every one's heart.
Ihis young man, having no one to live
for, resolved to follow in Washington's
footsteps and live for his country, which
was then struggling to free itself from the
tyranny of its mother country, Spain.
How well he succeeded the story of his
life and the way in which bis memory is
revered tells. Bolivar was given, while in
America, a portrait medal of Washington,
I which he always wore and which is the
THE PARROTâA DRAWING LESSON.
Draw three pairs of circles, as in the upper rowâthe small ones around a cent, the others
around a silver quarter. Add eyes, bill, feet, wings, tail and crest âalso a perch âand then
isee f the parrot will say, '-Polly wants a cracker."
only one of his many medals shown in any
statue or engraving of him.
Upon Bolivar's return to Venezuela he
immediately began to fight for the freedom
of his native land, which declared its in
dependence upon July 5, 1811.
So you see that the sth of July means
as much to Venezuelans as the 4th of July
does to us.
Finally Bolivar became commander-in
chief of the army and after brilliant vic
tories over the enemy was bailed by the
people whom he had freed as the deliverer
and father of his country, and was made
President of the new republic, which office
he held until his death on the 17th of De
cember, 1830, at the early age of 47 years.
We American boys and girls should
study about and honor Bolivar, the South
American hero, because the Venezuelan
boys and girls revere and know all about
our Washington, the Nortn American
hero, whose life was the inspiration of the
other, and whose statues, side by side with
Bolivar's, adorn the beautiful public
square and gardens in the lovely city of
Caracas, and whose picture bangs in their
Independence Hall. C. L. P. W.

One can readily imagine how interest
ing that wonderful little creature, the sea
urchin, or sea-hedgehoe, might be on a
whatnot or in a curiosity cabinet, but the
idea of having it on the dining-taWe and
eating it is quite different. And yet it is a
tid-bit much relished in some parts of
Italy and in China. Here is what Harper's
Round Table says about it:
Sea-urchins are edible and in some
countries are eaten boiled in the shell like
an egg. In certain coast towns of Italy
they even form quite an article of com
merce, and large is the number of those
engaged in the pursuit of diving tor sea
urchins. This method of diving is very
picturesque and amusing and, as may be
imagined, requires some skill.
More simple is the way the Chinese pro
ceed about it. There the fisherman pro
vides himself with a bundle of slender
wooden rods, tapered to a little round
knob at one end. With these he proceeds
to the surf at low tide and drops one of
these rods into each burrow where he
suspects a tenant. There it is left for
about two hours. Inn-Ing this time the
sea-urchin is sure to swallow the button,
and, as the clastic tissues contract, it is
unable to release itself again, so that
when the fisherman returns he can easily
extract the rod with the victim attached.
The Chinese stew the sea-urchins like a
tUi-Â»e soup.â Chicago Record.

"Do let the maid go," said she.
"My dear, the maid is also a woman,"
was the grave reply.
The man was tne late George Higin
botham, Chief Justice of Victoria. His
courtesy toward women was regardless of
rank or personal attractiveness. He would
take off his hat to his cook, and bow to
her as graciously as though she were a
duchess.
A man was trying to lead a heavy
drafthorse along the street. The ani
mal refused to be led, and the man made
several ineffectual attempts to mount the
refractory creature. At that moment the
Chief Justice came along, and seeing the
difficulty extended his handâ as a mount
ing block.
The man put his foot in the hand and
mounted upon the horse's back, and the
Chief Justice passed on.
His courtesy made his manners good,
but it did not soften his sense of justice.
A lawyer tells this anecdote:
"I had once to appear before him in
chambers on behalf of a charming client
who had some property, but would not
pay her debts. Tie case was heard in his
own room and he was courtesy itself. He
stood when she entered. I think she
dropped her handkerchief and he left his
seat to pick it up. Nothing could be
gentler than his manner and I was con
gratulating myself on an easy victory: but
when the facts were heard the decision
came that my client must pay or spend
six months in prison."â Youth's Com

HELPING THEMSELVE&
This little girl's name is Irma West. She lives
in Southern California. One day when Irma
was playing with her dolls, her mother called
her to shell some peas. She took them and
went out on the porch where it was cool and
sat down. In a little while some ducklings
came on the porch.
Irma had dropped two or three peas (not
meaning to) and the little ducks ate them.
Irma looked at them and said (for she meant
to pick them up), "Oh, you naughty ducJts,
you are eating those peas!"
After & while she had the peas all ready to
be cooked and took them to her mother. Irma
told her mother about the little ducks and
her mother laughed and said, "The little
ducks like peas, too, Irma."

THE CHILD AND THE DUCKLINGS.
One day a little girl sat on a basket shelling
peas, when she suddenly heard "Quack,
quack." Glancing up, she saw five little duck
lings coming toward her. One of them looked
as if he had been in the water; the others all
seemed to be dry. As they came nearer sne
noticed that they were not her own little duck
lings.
"They must have come from a yard near
ours looking for their mother," she said to
herself- One of them began to pick up the
peas from the ground, while the others wad
dled ud to tne empty pods. The one that
was wet sat in the sun and picked
his feathers. The little girl watched them,
raised her hand and said warningly: "Look
out! Look out, little ducklings! Get under
your mother a wings, to no hawk can catch
you." While she was saying this a fat duck
came waddling from a distance, the ducklings
ran up to her and she walked away, the five
little ones following her.

will write and tell what they did on the
Fourth. I went to a picnic in a lovely place In

had to go home and I wish the Fourth would

Los Alamos, July 18, '96.
Dear Editor: As I see so many letters printed
In The Sunday Call, written by the boys and
girls, I thought I might as well write as well
an anybody else. lam very interested in the
Childhood Realm.
My fattier takes The Daily Call and finds it a
very Interesting paper. Igo to the Los Alamos
Grammar SchooL My teacher's. name is Miss
Clara A. Lauuhlin. SheiJÂ«,Tery kind to all the
children. This is my first letter to The Call.

keeps a large liquor-stcre, and also a large
grocery-store, but the ' liquor-Â«tore Is entirely
i separated from.the grocery-store, and he also
gave it food, and from that time on Bessie and
the duck were fast friends.
The duck was soon full grown. One day
Bessie came running to her mother exclaim
ing:
"Oh, mamma, I can't find Ducky anywhere.
Have you seen her to-day?"
"No," *aid her mother, "but I guess she
hasn't gone far. Don't worry; Ducky will be
back before night."
But when night came, Ducky had not ap
peared. "I am afraid Ducky is lost, and will
never come back," said Bessie, a week later.
At the end of a few weeks, however, there
came a great surprise to the whole family. One
morning, as Bessie was watching the chickens,
what should appear around the corner of the
barn but Ducky, with five little fluffy duck- j
lings following behind her. Bessie at I
once remembered her old pet, who had been
gone for so long.
The little girl was so happy that she jumped
with joy and ran to the house to tell her
mother. "Come quick, mamma, and see
them," called Bessie. "What are you talking
about, dear?" asked mamma. "The ducks,"
answered Bessie. Mrs. Whito came to the
door and asked when they came. Then Bessie
told her about it.
All that day Bessie played with the little
duckr, and she gave each one a name, which
they soon learned and. would come whenever
she called them. Bessie loved to feed them
and they became great pets. Sometimes her
little dog Tray was jealous, for from the time
the ducks arrived they were petted more than
be was.
Near the house was a small pond, which the
little duck* and their mother used to swim in,
and Bessie thought it fine fun to watch them.
They thought it was fun, too, for they liked
the water better than they did the land.
In the morning, a* soon aa Bessie dressed,
the first thing she thought of was the ducks.
She always found them at the back door, for
she taught them to come there to be fed.
Now the ducks have grown up and Bessie Is
sorry, but her mamma tells her that they will
have some little ducklings for her to play
with, and she will have the same fun she has
j had witft the first, and so we will leave Bessie I
waiting and wishing for the next little pets to
hurry and come.

to see this letter in print, as some others might
like to know about how the ore is mined out
al*o.
When we first went down in the mines we
were surprised. It was so different from what
we had expected.
We first entered the cage, which is a sort of
elevator running up and down the shaft. This
shait is dug straight down 800 feet, with
drifts running horizontally from it. There
are four drifts in this particular shaft.
When we reached the first one we stepped
grandpa to the ferry. Then they took the
boat and cars and when their journey ended
met grandma with the phaeton.
Edith thought she never had such a nice
time when she fed the ducks and chickens
next day and held a basket of corn for old
Dobbin, and oh! such a pretty pony.
Georgte wanted to fish the first thing in a
little brook.
Edith used to like to help grandma cook the
dinner. The way she used to help wag shell
ir% the peas and stringing the beans.
-Grandma," she said one day, "may I take
tne peas out in the yard and shell them?"
â¢'Yes. dear; but you must be careful the
ducks don't get at them."
â¢â¢Yes, I will," and away ran Edith to fiad a
pan.
"I wonder what I can sit or," thought she,
as she went into the yard. "I'll see if there is

She discovered a basket which she pulled out
and seated herself upon it. The ducks evi
dently thought sne was going to feed them,
for they gathered around her with their bills
open.
"No, no. These are not for you. I already
fed you this morning," she said, putting her
hand up to frighten them away. As she did
so the pan tipped and several peas rolled to
the ground, and the ducks all made a rush for
them, so they soon were all gone.
"Oh dear!" she cried, "you naughty ducks!
You shan't get any more. I'll go where you
Can't get my peas," and she ran to the stoop,
"Have you finished?" said grandma coming
to the door.
"No, ma'am, not quite. Some spilled out of
my lap and the ducks ate them."
"Did they? Well it doesn't matter much,
there were so many."
A few days after aa Edith and Georgie came
from the woods, after they had gathered a
bouquet of wild flowers, they noticed a lady
with a baby going up the steps.
"It's mamma! Georgie," cried Edith, run
ning aa fast as she could. "Oh, mamma! is it
really you? How cunniug Robbie looks!" she
said, throwing her arms about her mamma's
neck and kissing her. "Oh, here is grandma."
"I was thinking," said grandpa at dinner to
raamms, "I would give the pony to Edith and
Georgie if you were willing. We don't need
any more horses."
"Oh, mamma, can't I please hare him T Do
let me !" cried Edith, clapping her hands.
"I don't see where we can keep him, I'm
sure. Grandpa is very kind to let you have
him, though."
"I never thought of that," said Edith.
"Isn't that too bad? Oh, I know! Wouldn't
Auntie May let us keep him in her stable with
her horse? Couldn't we ask her ?"
"Why, yes, I think we could. I don't think
sbe would mind. And the next time grandpa
comes to tee vi he will bring the pony."
"But, mamma, I thought we wure going to
have him now,'' said Edith.
"No, dear; not now."
The week passed very quickly and at last
came the day when they had to go home, and
grandpa drove them to the station
"Be sure and come again soon," said
grandma as they were getting on the train.
"Indeed we shall," cried they. "We have
had a delightful time."

into the hill. It was about 6}^ feet high.
Along the ground tracks are laid for the cars
containing the ore to run on to the shaft, then
it is taken to the surface. We met several of
these cars on the way in pushed by the miners.
Presently we came to a department in which
the men were working. They were hammer

and a few were engaged in timbering the top

in. One of the miners gave me a piece of the
ore. It was very heavy and of a reddish color.
The miners were very warm.
Though all was very interesting, it was a
relief when the cage landed us on the surface
once more, because the air in the mine was so
very oppressive.
I hope we nave given you an idea of how the

Forces of Nature
The discovery recently submitted to the
Paris Academic de Medicine by Dr. H.
Baraduc, in which he succeeded in photo
graphing thought impressions, is a most
important one. It is a scientificadmission
of what the Hindus have always known
and taught, and makes one more guide
post for the West in trying to arrive at â¢
real knowledge of man ana nature.
Some amusing deductions are made,
however, by the press of the world as to
what the new discovery proves. The
statement of the New York World that
it proves that "vital force, vitality,
thought, or whatever you may choose to
call it, is a physical force, not spiritual or
metaphysical at all," is preposterous.
Western science has never investigated
anything except the physical side of life.
It knows practically nothing of psychol
ogy, or the many tine forces which exist
in nature.
The finer forces of nature are almost
wholly unknown to the modern scientific
world, and the few recent discoveries are
not rLhtly understood. In India and
other Oriental countries we still retain
some knowledge of the hidden powers,
which knowledge was conferred upon hu
manity during the infancy of the earth.
But even there but little of this knowledge
is in the possession of the masses. The
greater portion is guarded jealously by the
priests, and they only impart it to appli
cants in the course of initiation into their
mysteries.
The X ray, the photographing of sound
and of thought prove the existence of a
hitherto unknown realm. It has extended
the sphere of electrical knowledge and
brought to view the field of vibrations.
These three discoveries are closely allied
to each other. They bring a super
physical force into the possession of
science. Science has passed beyond the
realm of ether, the fifth cosmic element,
and is now concerned with interetheric
forces.
In order to determine the position be
longing to this new force or forces one has
to turn to Oriental philosophy, where
definite statistical facts may be gleaned, j
The deeper philosophy is veiled in al
legory, but the general scope of evolution
and a somewhat detailed account of the !
plane of substance immediately beyond
physical matter is readily accessible.
The foundation cf the force which is
us d in thought photography may be
found by a study of what are called the
tattwas; or, matter in an ethereal con
dition. The writer does not profess a
complete Knowledge of these ethereal
bases of .ature, for that cornet only
through initiation, but the exoteric teach
ings are sufficient to give a general view
of the process of evolution and the inter
action between the various planes of
being. Briefly this may be sketched as
follows:
Lying back of all manifestation is
space â absolute, abstract space â tbe first
postulate to be considered in trying to
analyze the process of manifestation of
life and being. Space is shoreless, bound
less, of unimaginable circumference. It
possesses the quality of constant and
ceaseless motion, and this motion has
been given the name of the Great Breath.
Extending throughout space and coexten
sive with it is Mulaprattriti, spirit matter,
or, to put it roughly, the essence of con
sciousness and substance.
The Great Breath acts upon the subtile
matter scattered throughout space, and
there arise certain centers or modifications
known as the three aspects of Mahat
(idealism), these aspects being respectively
the logos, word or speech ; fire or action ;
and, lastly, the germinal essences of the
elements. From the last are emanated the
tanmatras or the potentialities of gross
matter; from the tanmatras come the
inahabhutas or tattwas â matter in an
ethereal condition â and the tattwas in
turn evolve the sthulabnutas, or the five
forms of cosmic matter â ether, air, fire,
water and earth.
It is from a study of their tattwas that
definite knowledge may be had concern
ing the forces utilized in Roentgen's X
ray and in the recent experiments in
thought photography.
There are seven of these tattwas, but
as two of them are secret they cannot be
given:
A kasa tattwa; sonoriferous, having the
attribute of sound, and the parent of the
ether of science.
Vayu tattwa; tangiferous; taste; parent
of air.
Tejas tattwa; luminiferous; color: par
ent of fire.
Apas tattwa; gustiferous; taste; parent
of water.
Pritbivi tattwa; odoriferous; smell;
parent of earth.
The term akasa is generally translated
into English by the word ether, but by
reference above it will be seen that while
a correspondence exists they are not the
same, akasa being the first of the five
tattwas and ether the first of the five
cosmic elements. Akasa has also been
held by science to be the medium for the
transmission of light, but its nature places
it far above the plane of tejas tatiwa, the
lurainiferous "ether." Akaea tattwa is
all-pervading, and from its vibrations are
produoed sound. In the telephone and
photopbone we have the phenomena
of the transmission of sound. It
is clear that the rays which carry
such sound are not the visual rays
of the sun. They are audible rays, the
vibrations of the sonoriferous "ether."
The vibrations themselves never cease,
and we can sense them whenever we pro
vide proper media for their transmission.
As to the nature of vibration it should
be understood that each tattwa has a par
ticular form of its own. In Rama
Prasad's erudite work on "Nature's Finer
Forces," we find these vibrations ex
plained in minute detail. In akasa
tattwa the external form of the vibration
is something like the hole of the ear:
The matter which is subject to it is
thrown into the form of a dotted sheet:
The dots are little points which rise
above the common surface, so as to pro
duce microscopic pits in the sheet It is
said that it moves by fits and starts, and
moves in all directions. The impulse
falls back on itself along the line of its
former path, which lies on all sides of the
direction of the wave:
Each tattwa produces in gross matter
vibrations similar to its own, and the form
into which vibrations throw the atmo
spheric air is a true clew to the tattwa
which is for the time predominant. The
secondary quality of akasa is space, the
interstices between the microscopic points
serving to give space to the ethereal
minima and affording them room for
locomotion.
The vibrations of vayu tattwa, tangifer
ous "ether," are described as being spheri
cal in form, and its motion is at right
angles to the wave. On paper these vibra
tions would be represented thus:
Locomotion is a quality of this tattwa,
for motion in all directions is motion in a
circle, large or small. When to the motion
which keeps up the form of the different
tattwas is added the stereotyped motion
of vayu locomotion is the result.
Tejas tattwa, or luminiierous "ether,"
has been confounded with akasa by many
scientists, as they considered akasa and
"radiant matter" to be identical. It is
true that the phenomena of light woufd
have no explanation were it not that there
is a "luminiferous ether," and the vibra
tions of this tattwa produce light, but it is
quite distinct from ooth akasa and the
cosmic ether. One may ask, if these vi
brations produce light, and this tattwa
pervades all space, why is it that light is
not produced to our eyes in a dark room.
The real fact is that we must make a dif
ference between the vibrations of the
tattwas and the vibrations of the media
which transmit these impressions to our
senses. It is not the vibrations of the
tattwas that cause our perceptions, but
the ethereal vibrations transferred to dif
ferent media of gross matter. Our senses
are at present attuned only to catch im
pressions from physical sources and we
cannot directly perceive the subtile centers
from which the impressions are indirectly
derived. The luminiferous ether is pres
ent just as much in the darkened room as
in the space without. If we could succeed
in bringing ourselves en rapport with the
real condition of things the darkened
room would cease to be dark with us. We
are not yet able to see the vibrations in
the tattwa without some medium of rela
tion between ourselves and it.
In this luminiferous ether lies the ex
planation of the discoveries so recently
made. In the case of the X ray a certain
quality of electrical force is used which
enables luminiferous ether vibrations to
react upon the media surrounding, and
the molecules of wood, iron or of the
human body are thrown into a similar
rate of vibration, lighting up the mass of
physical matter and permitting an un
obstructed vision through it. In the case
of thought photography a film or sensitive
plate of such quality has been prepared
that it is able to catch the vibrations of
light and color that are projected toward it.
A film has been discovered that is capable
of being transformed into the tejastc
vibration. In addition to light and color
this tattwa also transmits vibrations of
heat. The vibrations take place at right
angles to the direction of the wave. This
makes the tattwa wave in an upward
direction, and the center of the direction
is, of course, the direction of the wave.
One whole vibration of tejas makes the
figure of a triangle. In this figure â
A B is the direction of the wave; B C
the direction of the vibration; and CA
the line along which (seeing that the sym
metrical arrangement of the atoms of a
body are not changed) the vibratory atom
must return to its position in the line A B.
Expansion is a quality of tejas tattwa.
This naturally follows from the shape and
form of motion which is given to this
ethereal vibration.
Apas tattwa, or gustiferous "ether," in
shape resembles the half-moon, and is
said to move downward. Its direction is
opposite to that of tejas tattwa, and this
force causes contraction. It possesses the
quality of smoothness. As the atoms of
any body in course of contraction come
near each other and asiume the semi
lunar shape of the apas they easily glide
over each other. The very shape secures
for the atoms easy motion. It is repre
sented â
Prithivi tattwa, odoriferous "ether," has
the quality of cohesive reactance. This,
it will be seen, is the reverse of akasa.
Akasa gives room for locomotion, while
prithivi resists it. This i* the natural re
sult of the direction and shape of this vi
bration. It covers up the spaces of the
akasa with its quadrangular shape:
This is said to move in the "middle."
It neither mores at right nor acute angles, j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
JKe Aii-skip That a Rochester Man Is Building
A telegraphic dispatch to the New York
Herald gives some interesting particulars
of a great airship that is being constructed
in Rochester, N. V., and which the ex
perts believe will at last solve the problem
of aerial transportation.
The inventor and owner is John F.
Cooley, and i.c has entered into a con
tract with P. P. Dickinson of Rochester
whereby he agreed to construct an airship
and accomplish at least four ascensions
during the present year. The contract
specifies that the ship shall be 200 feet
long, with a sail area of 14,000 feet, and
capable of carrying at least six persons.
Work upon the ship is well under way,
and without the intervention of unfore
seen contingencies the first ascent will be
made within the next six weeks. Mr.
Cooley describes his machine as follows:
"The principles and forces employed in
nor up nor down, but moves along the
line of the wave.
According to the above classification
physical matter is limited to the cosmic
elements, and of these only the four lower
onesâ air, fire, water, carth â are purely
physical. The fifthâ etherâ is semi-mate- j
rial, and is hardly known yet, that which j
has usually been called ether being, as '
stated, the tejasic tattwa. It is said that i
toward the close of this cycle ether will be
seen in the air, and that it will dominate
over the purely physical elements during
the whole of the succeeding cycle. There
are still two other cosmic elements â of a
superphysical nature â which at present
are entirely beyond human perception
and will not become known until ages
hence.
The tattwas are composed of matter, but
not of physical matter. It would be more
coavenient to use the term substance in
describing them, and this term may prop
erly be used in reference to all planes of
being up to that of pure spirit.
In trying to determine between matter,
substance and spirit, and whether any
particular object is referable to the physi
cal plane or to a higher one, it may be
advisable to remember that there are four
great planes of existence: Physiological, i
mental, psychic and spiritual. For each j
of tbese planes there are appropriate
vehicles of action. In the physiological
the cosmic elements; in the psychic, the j
tattwas and tanmatras; in the mental,
there are vehicles or bases for the
manifestation of thought, which are
closely allied to, but above, the bases on
a psychic plane; while on the spiritual
plane substance is of so fine a texture that
it is impossible to describe it with any
words known to the English language.
There is actually a substance utilized
when one thinks, but it bears little corre
spondence to physical matter. Each
thought is composed of substance, just as
a table is composed of wood. Thoughts
thus possess forms, depending on the na
ture of the thought, and they persist as
entities for a greater or less lefigtb of time
after they are projected from the mind
which gives them expression. These
thought entities may travel with more
than lightning rapidity. One can think
of the sun or of the polÂ« star as quickly as
he can think of New York or Chicago, and
no sooner is a place thought of than the
thought is projected to that place.
If a man thinks of his wife, his child or
his friend, there is instantaneously formed
in his mind a subjective image of that per
son, corresponding in clearness with the
intensity of bis thought, and depending
also on his knowledge of the appearance
of the person.
In the experiment cited in regard to
two friends of Dr. Baraduc, in which Dr.
Hasdeu went to bed at Bucharest at an
the construction are entirely unconven
tional and thoroughly original. Those
who have noticed the flight of birds, such
as the eagle, the hawk, the albatross and
others of unusually well developed powers
of flight, may have observed that very lit
tle movement of the wings is necessary to
enable them to maintain a continuous
flight of considerable length, the wings i
meanwhile being held apparently in a
fixed position as regards the body of the
bird. The bird's wings act as an inclined
plane of very slight angle, and cause a
downward deflection of the air from the
lower surface, thereby creating a sight
lifting tendency all over the under surface
of the wings.
"The sails I made and attached to the
model after studying numerous designs
and modes of attachment, thereby ascer
taining their different characteristics. For
agreed hour with a photographic plate at
his head, and Dr. Istrati went to bed at '
the same hour at Campana, 300 kilometers
distant, and willed that his likeness
should appear on the photographic plate
at Bucharest, the result proved to them
that thought could not only be photo
graphed, but photographed at a distance.
Dr. Istrati either consciously or un
consciously formed in his mind a subjec
tive picture of himself and wished or willed
that it should be transferred to the photo
graphic plate. The result appears per
fectly natural to Eastern students. The
only thing on which the result of the ex
periment depends is whether a proper re
ceiving media is procured. With this in
hand and an effort of will on the part of
the transmitter the experiment is quite i
sure to succeed. It would seem, however,
that the photographic plates are capable
of improvement. They are not sufficiently ;
sensitive, for it is reported that in some ;
instances two hours were required to pro- j
duce the pictures. When the proper re- i
ceiving media are obtained the photo
graphing should be instantaneous.
Regar ding the points delineated by Dr.
Baraduc that when the magnetometer was
held near the left side of the body the
needle was repulsed a distance of five de
grees, and when near the right side it was
attracted through an arc of twenty de
grees, it presents a problem in the study of
the magnetic and electrical forces of the
body which should lead up to something
further.
The statement volunteered to the New
York press to the eftect that Dr. Baraduc
has photographed a soul as it emanated
irom the left hand n incorrect. It is im
possible now to go fully into this subject,
as it would involve a study of the several
souls in man and of the various auras
surrounding him and the emanations
of various kinds that proceed from him.
The astral body â or, rather, bodies, for
there are several of themâ are loosely de
nominated souls, but these would not pass
out through the left hand. There are also
various thought bodies nlao grouped
under the generic term "soul," which
may be projected by man, but their point
of egress from the body is not the left
hand. One might, however, by effort of
the will, project some of the vapors or
magnetic fluids of his body through the
hand, or such a result might ensue auto
matically if a sufficient excitation were
set up by the proximity of a magnetom
eter, or from some other especially nerv
ous or magnetic cause.
If we admit the fact that mind stuff,
thought substance, is of an electrical na
tureâand this seems to be borne out by
experiments in hypnotism., mental sug
gestion and mesmerism, in which con
sciousness has been transferred to a sheet
of paper or a glass of water, and thoughts
the sails I finally selected the design
shown in the cut as offering the most ad
vantages from the standpoint of equi
librium, lightness and small resistance,
combined with great supporting strength.
When I finished I had a model of a type
of airship which satisfied me that I was
on the right track. In fact, the model
when thrown from the hand would soar
for 150 feet or more in beautiful fashion,
holding its course until its forward mo
mentum was exhausted.
"The material that is being pat in the
ship, which is now under way at Charlotte,
is principally basswood and pine. For

the interior of the ship, which is entirely
inclosed, about the size of an ordinary

of different kinds excited by applying
magnets to the patientâ it does not follow
that thought is physical or that the con
scious soul is a product of matter. Elec
tricity is not a physical force, though
when proper media are secured physical
effects may be produced by electricity, i
Thought force is as much finer than elec- !
tricity as the latter is finer than day. j
Thought substance is of an interetheric
nature, much finer than what is known as
astral matter, but on proper conditions
being effected it will set up vibrations in
the tattwic essences, and these, in turn,
react on the grosser elements of chemistry,
so that the thought image is projected into
objectivity and made visible to the physi- I
cal eyes.
In connection with thought photog
raphy it may be recalled that successful â 
attempt.* have also been made in photo- j
graphing sound, Professors Halleck and
Muckey of Columbia College having made
a number of satisfactory tests. The ra
tionale of this is similar to the experi
ments with thought. Both sound and
thought as well as color manifest as
modes and rates of vibration and on being
projected toward the objective plane they
assume definite shapes dependent on the
vibratory wave, and the forms become
visible when the proper media are fur
nished for their expression.
Mechanical contrivances have also been
lately invented which transmit thoughts
from one mind to another, and when the
mechanism has been attached to an ani
mal the wires have even conducted to the
human brain the feelings of anger, mo
roaeness, pain or joy as they were suc
cessively excited in the dumb brute.
The natural media through which
thought affects physical matter is an inter
etheric substance of a highly electrical
nature, which is known generally as the
astral light. This light is septenary, the
several planes bearing a close relation to
the various tatt was, and the nearer science
arrives at a knowledge of the electrical
forces as they exist on these subtle planes
of existence, the lower of which are semi
material and the hiehest purely spiritual,
the nearer will they come into -a knowl
edge of the nature and action of thought.

Tke Probability
Of Future Long
Distance Vision
What a great help it would be to the
Goddess of Justice were she able to extend
her optical powers beyond the limit of
human vision. Supposing that when
some lynx-eyed official in a distant town
had taken into custody a phantom Dun
ham, it were possible to ring up the San
Francisco Chief, and then to stand the
suspected culprit in front of a little box
connected with a wire with the Police
Office here, so that Captain Lees looking
into the little box at his end of the will
could see the party posing in tront of the
distant box. What a saving of expense
and settlement ot uncertainty !
What a help to commercial transactions
if it were possible for a man having a
check drawn by a maker who resides in a
distant community, to be able to step into
a bank, and then calling up the maker
of the check, have him identify his work
and the payee to the satisfaction of the
cashier!
What an immense satisfaction it would
be to the man to be able to see the tele
phone girl that is giving him taffy and
delay!
The desire is not at all an unreasonable
one. Its gratification is strictly within
the bounds of possibility, for recent dis
coveries have made it extremely probable
that before the close of the century devices
will be in use whereby a person may s<je
his distant correspondent with as perfect
vision as he now hears his voice by means
of the telephone.
The telectroscope (tht, name is formed
from the Greek words "Telos," afar;
"electros," electricity, and "scopis," I
see â "I see afar by the aid of electricity")
is an instrument which in its operation
converts light into magnetism, the mag
netism into electricity, and then trans
mits the electricity over a conducting wire
to the distant station where another in
strument reverses the process and con
verts the electricity into magnetism and
the magnetism into light again, the opera
tion proceeding almost precisely on simi
lar lines as those employed -in the tele
phone.
The telectroscope is the result of a great
deal of careful study of the natural laws
governing the phenomena of light and
electricity. It is not one of those things
which we sometiroes hear of, which "just
come to me all in a minute, don't you
know." It is a triumph of scientific rea
soning along lines of deduction.
For a long time scientific men have been
looking for the explanation of certain
phenomena in connection with electric
energy. To be able to say positively that
electricity and light were one and the
same would have lifted the veil, and re
moved the uncertainty that surrounded
many of the vexed questions. Now the
veil is partly swept aside, and is gradually
being altogether removed. Lord Kelvin â
Sir William Thomsonâ one of the fore
most scientists of the world, and the
recognized greatest authority on electricity,
was recently honored in the city of Glas
gow by the celebration of his jubilee, at
which were present the distinguished men
from all over the world, the giants in the
realm of physical science, come to
acknowledge and honor their master. In
his speech of the evening, Lord Kelvin
eaid: "Concerning electricity, I do not
know any more to-day than when I began.
I have simply learned a few of its tricks."
Yet the positive discovery is made that
electricity and light are only different
manifestations of the same thing. Their
differentiation is simply a matter of differ
ence in the rate of vibration. Change the
rate of the vibration of electricity and it
becomes light.
We see a tree, or a house, or any other
object, because the rays of light proceed
from the different portions of the tree or
house in different degrees of intensity,
and so impress upon our retina different
nerve effects, which make up to our con
sciousness tte image which we recognize
as the tree or the house. The whole pro
cess is simply one of light.
. We have all noticed the beautiful colors
produced by a ray of sunlight falling upon
a piece of glass having two or more un
equal surfaces, forming a miniature rain
bow. The band of brilliant hues passing
from red through the intermediate colors
to violet, is called the " spectrum," and is,
in fact, a picture of the primary colors
which, when all are blended together,
form white light.
When science desires to produce the
solar spectrum it takes a piece of glass of
a triangular shape, called a prism, and
allows a ray of sunlight to fall upon it.
The prism separates the white ray of sun
light into its component parts, and there
is thrown upon the wall or screen a ribbon
of exquisitely brilliant hues, in which the
blending ol one color with that adjoining
is impossible of imitation by any known
process of art.
Some years ago a man of an investigat
ing turn of mind took a thermometer and
moved its bulb along the colored spectrum
to see if one colored ray was warmer or
colder than another. He found that away
to the left of the red ray was an invisible
heat ray, and when the thermometer was
placed there the mercury went up with a
bound. Then other men began to investi
gate further, and there was found another
invisible ray located away to the right of
the violet ray, which was a chemical rayâ
the "actinic." A sensitized photographic
plate is more speedily acted upon when
placed in the dark spot occupied by this
invisible actinic ray than if it were ex
posed to the full sunlight. But investi
gation was not content to stop here. Ex
periment after experiment was continued
and there has been discovered the pres
ence of a magnetic ray (invisible), and an
electric ray, also invisible. It is the mag
netic ray that is made use of in the opera
tion of the telectroscope.
It is unnecessary to go into a description
of the operation of the, subtle laws govern
ing the production of electricity from
magnetism, or magnetism from electricity;
sufficient to say that the result of the pro
| cess ia well known, and is applied in the
transmission of electrical power. Elec
tricity always produces magnetism, and
magnetism always produces electricity.
They are never separated, though each
possesses distinct characteristics and each
produces different phenomena. This is il
lustrated in the telephone. The voice of
the speaker produces sound waves in the
air, which, falling upon the soft iron
diaphragm, cause it to vibrate. Tbjs vi
bration makes the magnetism of the mag
net to vary, and its variation gives rise to
a series of electric pulsations, or currents,
on the coil of wire which surrounds the
end of the magnet, and are transmitted
over the conducting wire to the distant
station, where the process is reversed and
the vibrating diaphragm gives forth a
duplication of the spoken words.
That it was possible to convert light into
electricity has been long suspected, but
how to reconvert the electricity so formed
| back into light again was the puzzle.
A few years ago an instrument was de
vised whereby it became easy to view the
edge of the sun ana see trie magnificent
exhibitions of solar force in the shape of
i flames as they burst forth from the sun's
j surface. The instrument is called the
' spectroscope. It is formed of a combina
tion of prisms.
A savant named Noad in his investiga
tions in electrics found that a piece of Ice
land spar interposed between the eye
j and. a source of light rendered visible the
light, which was otherwise obscured by
| the passage of a magnetic ray.
On these discoveries and deductions is
founded the telectroscope.
The transmitting apparatus consists of
a box divided into three compartments.
A circular hole at the front end of the box
admits the ray of light, which passes to a
prism fixed in the first dividing wall of the
box. The prism decomposes the light,
and the magnetic ray is allowed to fall
upon a coil of fine, insulated wire, all the
other component rays being excluded. This
magnetic ray excites an electric wave or
current in the coil, which traverses the
I conducting wire to the distant station.
The receiving apparatus is somewhat
similar to the transmitter, save in a few
particulars. When the electric current
arrives at the receiver it forms a magnetic
! ray in the center of the receiving coil and
! is projected upon a prism, having first
i passed thro jgh a properly shaped piece
of Iceland spar. Emerging from the
prism, it is viewed by the person who re
reives it through a magnifying lens and
appears of a viole (hue.
As yet there is some little to be done in
the matter of detail to make the telectro
i scope available for all purposes. But the
j needed labor i 3 along lines that are now
â¢â  well defined and understood. The whole
| device is exceedingly simple when once
! known.

True, there may be men who would not,
for worlds, have a telectroscope in their
I office; but, all the same, they would
i eagerly employ it elsewhere.

The last of the three gowns shown in the
illustrations is from Felix and is composed
of silk muslin striped with sets of gold tin
sel or silk lines ; f rotn below the upper part
of the sleeves to tho elbow the decreasing
fullness is arranged into spaced tucks.
White satin bolero elaborately embroid
ered with gold and edged with lace re
lieved with gold threads, and finished off
with smart revers in mordore velvet, each
forming double points divided by a taper
ing fluting, and resting on delicate accor
dion pleatings of pink and green silk
muslin. Long vest fronts in cream lace,
describing closacoquilles round the neck
and down the^sides. Velvet belt grace
fully knotted into loops and ear-like ends.
Toque in fluffy lisse or white silk muslin ,
composed of masses of fine faille pleatings
outlined with baby ribbon in black velvet,
, which are veiled round the brim with
black tulle. Wide loop to match. White
and black oiseaux de paradis plumes. A
tuft of roses and choux of muslin raise the
brim at the back.
The pretty evening frock is a model of
simplicity, being made of a pale rose
glace taffeta. The bodice is gracefully
draped with white monsseline de soie,
two long scarfs of which extend down
the right side edged with lace at the ends,
which is beautified with tiny opals sewn
thickly over it. Tbe same lace forms the
very stylish sleeves. An edging of opals is
seen on the mousseline, wnich is artisti
cally carried from the right arm to the left
side at the waist line.
The tea gown is one just completed for the
troosseau of the Princess Maud. The de
sign, for a slender woman, is very grace
ful. It is carried out in turquoite blue
. figured silk striped with black. The yoke
is made of straps of white guipure over
black satin, alternating with bouillonnes
of tbe blue silk. The puffs of the sleeves
are trimmed to match. The Watteau back
is drawn in at the waist by a girdle of
black ribbon. The gown is lined with a
lighter shade of blue silk.
I see that the Duchess of Marlborough
was present at the marriage of Lady
Sophie Cadogan, which was the smartest
wedding of the season in London. The
Duchess wore a pink and pray shot glace
silk, with a collar-band and sash of pink
glace. Her large black hat had ostrich
plumes to mutch and a bow of gray chine
ribbon. Tbe very pretty bride wore an
unusually charming gown. It was of the
richest ivory satin obtainable. Round
the hem of tne skirt and the long train
was embroidered a beautiful floral design
in silver and small pearl?. This was fin
ished at the edge with three tiny ruches of
chiffon. The bodice was made with a
chiffon yoke narrowly tucked and bor
dered with exquisite Brussels lace, over
which softly draped chiffon, inserted with
pearl and silver embroidery, was drawn
into a high satin sash. The transparent
sleeves, of drawn chiffon, were completed
at the top with bow epaulets of embroid
ered satin. Lady Bophie's "going-away"
dress, of ivory crepe de chine, had a sim
ple but lovely bodice draped with Aiencon
lace, caught at one side with the palest
Malmaison carnations.
At the neck a soft touch of this becom
ing silk was introduced. A quaint little
cravat of lace was very becoming. The
Jong, tight-fitting sleeves of ruched
mousseline de soie had epaulets of crepe
de chine, and the full, softly hanging
skirt was edged with a ruching of mousse
line and lace insertions. Her large white
hat was covered with feathers. The seven
bridesmaids were attired alike in gauzy
and ethereal gowns of ivory mousseline de
Boie, the full bodices veiled with flounces of
deep cream lace, lightly embroidered with
diamonds. The long sleeves of lace were
transparent from the elbow, and the soft
skirts, tbe foundation's of which were
of accordion-pleated glace, were veiled
with two skirts of mousseline de soie, the
top one being finished with a narrow tulle
ruche. The long sashes were of white
glace ribbon, with a design of earlsnds of
pale tinted flowers, tied with small true-
Jovrrs' knots, and were fastened on one
side with diamond buttons, the long
ends falling to the edge of the
skirt?. Their hats were of white fancy
straw, caught up on one side and softly
draped around the crowns with folds of
white tulle. They were trimmed with
glace ribbon to match the cashes, black
tulle and a plume of feathen on one side
tied with a dow of ribbon. The Princess
of Wales was in a lovely dress of ivory
silk, brocaded in a design of mauve con
volvulus, with a folded belt and collar of
â  mauve satin, and the skirt edged with lace
insertion. The Princess wore a white
bonnet wreathed with, mauve tulle,
sprinkled with gold sequins with small
tips of the same hue on the left side. The
Princesses Victoria and Maud of Wales
were dressed alike in grass lawn embroi
dered in pale blue and made up over blue
silk; the fronts of the bodices were prettily
draped with blue chiffon, tbe sashes and
collars matching, and the Bisirts were
edged with a narrow blue frill. They Wore
toques composed of dcep-hued roses and
foliage, with blue osprey at the side.
If any of my readers secured at the re
cent silk sales a goodly number of yards
of crepe de chine they can at once have a
gown in the very latest style, as there is
an absolute rage for this fabric in Paris
and London. One creation of tbe palest
shade of gray has tbe hem of the skirt
trimmed with three very narrow frills of
Valenciennes lace. The bodice overhangs a
corselet, and brace-like paulettes are
made of creamy lace studded with silver
sequins. Ronnd the vraist is twisted a
belt of cherry-colored silk, which again
appears at tbe neck. Quite as lovely is
one of pale lavender tone. The simp c
skirt hangs perfectly, and tbe well-cot
bodice has niched sleeves of white mousse
line de Boie. Of this the pretty vest is
made, with tbe addition of innumerable
little frills of Valenciennes. About the
waist is twisted a ribbon of a deeper shade
of the lavender.

NeW York
RevWal of a pretty

Among the very latest frivolities of rib
bon-loving womanhood is noted the re
vival of the sash. A hint from Paris pave
the idea, a few American modistes quickiy
appropriated it, and of a sudden sashes
are taking the lead in the procession of
fads, says the New York World.
The revival of this pretty old time dec
oration is evident not only on the cos
tumes of young women and children, but
of women of all ages. The elderly matron
no. longer allows the generous curves of
her figure to shape themselves uninter
ruptedly. Sash ribbons adorn her simplest
gown and flaunt themselves gayly from
the frocks that wouid otherwise be staid
and sober.
The opposite extremes of a fashion are
wont to flourish contemporaneously and
it is perhaps not unnatural that the modes
of a single season should demand both
the very narrow belt and the very wide
sash. The inch-wide belt that requires
mathematical precision for its adjustment
as well as an extraordinary trimness of
figure can alternate only with the broadest
and widest of sashes. The latter are con
sidered appropriate on any gown and
many are of so rich texture and beautiful
color that they are sufficient for the entire
decoration of a costume.
Roman sashes are in tbe highest favor,
a fact which the owners of certain precious
heirlooms will De greatly gratified to
hear. The wider the silk and the gayer
the stripes and the heavier the material
the more fashionable such an heirloom is.
A sash combining delicate shades of
mauve, pink and blue and set off by plain
stripes of black and white will harmonize
with almost any of. the light summer
organdies and batistes, while tbe plain
ness of a white or ecru jrown is invariably
relieved by such ai addition. On the
other hand there are sashes of deeper and
richer tones with striking, combinations of
black, blue, green and gold that form
charming accessories to the darker silks
and muslins that are inducted in the sum
mer wardrobe.
An illustration of the power of a Roman
sash to give the distinctive touch to a cos
tume was noted the other evening at a
brilliant seashore function. The gown,
which was worn by a slender young
woman, was of black gauze. It was sim
ply fashioned and cut with a square neck
and drooping sleeves. About the waist
was tied a sash, wherein black, gold
flame-color and a touch of scarlet were
most exquisitely mingled.
Another novelty of the present season
takes the form of gauze sashes, a very
hapt>7 innovation.
The saga itself is of black gauze, bright
colored flowers being embroidered upon it
at frequent intervals in an approximately
regular pattern. Or the gauze may be
white, if the sash is designed for wear with
a lighter gown. The sash is bordered with
fringe.
Ribbons that are plaided, striped or
flowered are used for sashes, and the num
berless styles of ribbon make, of course, a
wide variety possible. When ribbon eight,
ten or twelve inches in width is used for
making a sash, there is usually a bow on
tbe shoulder of the gown of tbe same ma
terial. This is a new fancy and a very
pretty one, the shoulder-knot of the stiff
taftata giving a very stylish touch even to
a simple gown.
For the happy owner of a sash the first
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
question is, of course, in regard to tying it. I
All ignorant ones should mow, then, that
the bow, when the sash is of soft Â«ilk,
should be tied directly in the back. The
loop-ends of tbe bow-knot should be but
three or four inches in length, leaving the
ends to extend nearly to the bottom of the
gown. For a sash tied in this fashion
three yards is a good length, though nome
of the newest sashes are only two and a
half in length. However, as the old-fash
ioned sashes are lour or five yards lonp,
and the Jength must be disposed of in
some fashion, the oldtime bowknot, with
loops and ends nearly equal in length,
is "till frequently seen. If the beauty of
tbe sash justifies this departure from ac
cepted styles the wearer is not likely to be
criticized.
When moderately narrow ribbon is used
j it is a pretty fashion to tie the bow at one
side of tbe front in a wide milliner's knot
with several loops and two ends. This Is
becoming, however, ouly to slim figure?.
At present the sash is the most conspic
uous feature of fashionable dress. It is
well that it is being made the most of
while it ia here, for it is too charming and
comfortable a fashion to endure long.
Shoulder capes and -mantles are all now
being marked down, and some of them are
certainly to be had at figures which would
not cover the cost of the fabrics employed.
Those of grass lawn over silk, much beau
tified with appliques of lace and sequins,
are snre temptations, but those of black
chiffon over black satin, white satin or
j glace are well nigh irresistible. An even
ing cape of white cloth, lined with palest
preen taffeta, has a long scarf of the Mime
which ties in a great bow in front. It is
O OQO
bordered with an odd Paisley pattern and
may be safely purchased and laid aside,
for it will do good service all next winter.
Young girls who dress smartly are quite
fascinating in the latest hats made of
chiffon, alternating with small frills of
ince. They are to be had in shades of
pale pink and a delicate green principally,
these being the most becoming colors.
A spray of roses, or a mauvre iris is the
only trimming. This latter is a flower
now enjoying great iavor, but the reign of
flowers is drawing to a close, for already
the leading milliners are discussing birds
and wings. The every newest quills are
of soft texture and curled. Thus far this
novelty has not left Paris, so such quills
are extremely expensive. Ordinary cha
peaux having black quills tipped with
white are in great demand. When used on
hat composed of a straw* of a ficelle
hue, tied with scarfs of grass-lawn ribbon,
having a narrow silk edge, they look very
well, but the latest fad in the most exclu
sive millinery establishments in Europe is
a combination of white birds and cherries
or currants on tbe most cbie of hats. Tbere
is a steady demand for a Holland tone of
straw. Very picturesque and becoming
are the imported hats in Manilla or Ital
ian straw, trimmed with white feathers,
birds of paradise and mixtures of roses
and ribbons beneat h the brim at the side.
They appear to have been especially de
signed to wear with the beautiful toilettes
of embroidered lawn , organdy and muslin
which have so delighted our artistic souls,
and it is true that at Ascot and the Grand
Prix the best of the frocks were certainly
those of embroidered linen and those show
ing lace or lawn bodices allied to shot silk
> skirts.
Gorrect
Things for Mer\
to Wear
Sack and Regulation
Lounge Suits or
Morning
Dress
Unless a man intends to play lawn
bowls, golf or tennis, or wishes to ride,
drive or sail, he mast, if at any fashion
able resort, if in his office, indeed, if visi
ble at all, appear in a lounge suit, but he
has one choice; be may wear either the
sack or the regulation lounge, or the morn
ing suit. The most fashionable lounge
coat has three buttons, the waistcoat and
trousers being of the same fabric, or, as I
have previously remarked, a waistcoat of
brown Holland or linen' with horn but
tons is correct and popular. Such coats
are rounded gradually away in front. In
England the flaps of the pockets even are
rounded and the coat must hang as nearly
straight as possible. I have seen several
excellent lounge suits here this summer,
bat many have a serious defect; the
shoulders slope entirely too much, when,
in reality, they should have a decidedly
square effect.
I saw a New Yorker last Monday who
certainly was curiously attired. He had
on an excellent covert coat, a good lounge
suit, an incorrect bat, very pointed shoes,
such as have entirely gone out, and the
latest style gray suede self-stitched gloves.
Truly an odd combination. Fancy tan
shoes and euede glows. Well, to be sure,
this particular man is not known, when at
home, as ever being smartly dressed. I
only mention these facts to call attention
to the fact that care should be bestowed on
every detail that relates to a man's cloth
ing.
For wear, when yachting, nothing has
been found to equal blue serge made with
a reefer or pea jacket for stormy weather.
Colored shirts are worn with such suits.
"For a dinner or an evening reception, if
not in naval uniform, if simply a civilian
on board a yacht, unless the occasion be
extraordinary, the same rules prevail as
at any other afternoon or evening func
tion. The visitors, of course, are dressed
as they would be on land, the members
of the yachting party in their yachting
clothes or in uniform, or in informal even
ing dress. Generally here tha Oowes or
dress jacket takes the place of the evening
coat by those who are living on board tbe
yacht." ' C C.
J\ Very Ghic Womarx
A very ebic woman looks her best in a
white foulard silk covered with queer little
blac* scrolls. In this case the nest is com
posed of black mousseline de aoie over
wnite satin. On the mousseline are appli
qued lace roses. The sleeves have a very
small puff and are ruched. This gown is
so skillfully arranged that it oan also be
worn with a fichu of black mousseline de
soie, round which is seen a knife-pleating
of mousseline, which, in turn, is edged
with a little Valenciennes lace. Foulards
are exceedingly fashionable and one hav
ing a white ground with a blue pattern
upon it has lately been completed by a
good woman. The bodice is seamed in the
center of the back and drawn in narrow
folds to the front, where it is fastened with
rosettes, ornamented with diamond but
tons. A loose rever falls on either side of
tbe bust to reveal a fichu and collar made
of esprit net, outlined with grass lawn
embroidery frilled with lace.
A skirt of a good quality of black and
white silk may be considered both an
economical and desirable purchase, for
it looks extremely well with a bodice of
black chiffon, .over white silk, trimmed
with white lace, or with one of white
chiffon with here and there a touch of
black. One such skirt worn with an ac
cordion pleated white chiffon bodice,
having a transparent yoke of fine black
thread all tracra with diamonds, was pro
nounced a decided success.
I do not presume it will do a particle of
good to urge women not to wear their old
blacK skirts of silk, satin or brocade with
light bodices, for they â "most of them â
dearly love the combination. It is far
from effective usnally, and in summer de
c.dedly inappropriate. Those who pur
chase two or three brocade or chine
bodices for this purpose'inafce a great mis
take, for if the skirt must be utilized let
the evening bodices be studies in black
and white. or white and black. A. broad
corselet belt of jet traced with steel is said
to add mnch to such toilettes. Chiffon
when arrayed picture fashion and crossed
is very becoming to most figures, but
remember, skirts of black canvas, made
over black taffeta silk, are most desirable
to wear with fancy bodices. They are
made perfectly plain, but they must be
very well cut and hung, otherwise they
lose their .cachet. Bodices made
of silk showing tulle-fillea basques of
satin ribbon, either black or colored, are
said to be coming into fashion, as are also
the tabbed basques made with edgings of
kilted ribbons. A bodice lately noted and
much admired was made of cream colored
satin, covered with a creamy net of a
deeper tone, the basque and collar befog
edged with a quilling of satin.
JMaltese Lace ii\ Vogue
Maltese lace is again in vogue, and with
chiffon of a yellowish hue, it is quits de
lightful. Entire bodicea with tilled
basques are being made yet with rare suc
cess. A plain but beautifully fine, white
muslin frock having motifs of maltese
lace in wreath designs sewn round the
hem is positively charming.
Boleros are being made of all sorts and
kinds of stuffs; ior instance, one rather
extravagant but very successful dress
maker utilized, the other day, for this pur-
Dose, a deep lace flounce with an applique
of bright tinted velvet guipure round the
top ana down the sides. Su6 is now at
work on two more. One of these will
show a mossy green combination and
another a lovely violet on<\ American
and French women take very kindly to
these smart little affairs and they cer
tainly give a certain air and a finish to
any gown ; one of lace over a white alpaca,
with a touch of color, completely trans
formed it. A dress of white hopsacking
has gone to Lake Tahoe. It has a bolero
braided in green and fichu outlined with
a quilling of black satin ribbon.
When going on a short trip nothing is
more comfortable than one of the very
popular foulard dresses, and although
they have dark grounds when used for
such, purposes, they are relieved by white
vests and chokers. Some also wear white
gloves and veils with them, but tan gloves
end blade veils are in better taste. A good
model for such a gown has a round bodice,
A triple boxpleal in the back is put on as
drapery, tbure being no seams, excepting
those under the arms. A leathern belt,
with a quaint arid handsome buckle, looks
well as a finish. However, many prefer
a girdle of ribbon to match the frock,
which term mates in a smart bow.
A beautiful woman should do every
thing possible to increase he* charms, and
an ugly woman should do everything pos
sible to hide her defects; in fact, an ugly
woman, dressed with care, has many times
proved a serious rival to a beautiful woman
carelessly gowned.
From Newport comes the information
that "many young matrons are weariug
dazzling silks. For example, Mrs. F. M.
Pâ is a perfect picture in a violet and
white Pekine skirt, jape unie, the stripes
running straight up and down in front.
Corsage of white mousseline de soie over
white silk, entirely plisse. The sleeves
were particularly, pretty, the tops in three
double ruffles plisse, and the lower arm
close-fitting and well draped over the silk.

The Fetching Gar Was
Dress Worn by a
San JRafael
Matron
A pretty young girl last week took to
Santa Cruz a white grenadine. Tho bodice
iÂ« tucked from a yoke of silk embroidery,
which is outlined with a frill of the grena
dine, edced with violet ribbon, bordered
again' with a narrow quilling of black
â satin ribbon. No lovelier gown can be
conceived for an informal dance; indeed,
it is suitable for even a large and formal
affair. The lining is of white taffeta
glace. I like a frock she has of white
pique, for it is not only very well made,
but exceedingly useful as 'well.. It has a
bodice made with some exceptionally fine
Irish lace, and a short jacket as well, with
which she wears dainty vests of chiffon
and mousseline de soie as well, as short
waists of many colors, all well made and
most becoming, accompany this maiden,
who is always smartly clad, on a very
small allowance.
A stylish matron wore in San Rafael re
cently a dark-blue canvas made over a
crimson-Bilk foundation. The bodice had
a yoke effect in front made of a very open
Persian embroidery. The sleeves wire
tight-fitting with cuffs of the embroidery
lined with crimson silk, which extended
well over the bands. Full epauletteÃ of
the same were very becoming. A simple
black-straw hat with a roll of black chif
fon and some unusually fine crimson roses
completed a stylish costume. Another,
noted the same day, consisted of a light
weight cloth skirt of hunter's green and a
chic jacket of a light-tan shade
which â¢ fitted most perfectly. I cannot
understand why women will accept from
tailors and dressmakers gowns that simply
; disfigure them. At present I am thinking
| of a friend who has an unusually beautiful
figure, whom I lately met attired in a per
j fectly new tailor gown, and this garment,
; altiiough made to order, could not have
i been a worse tit if bought ready made, for
â  the collar and revers wrinkled and set
; simply horribly. Unless a tailor-made
{ costume hts 10 perfection about the neck
i it is a boich, and even if you have fur
j rushed the materials it is wiser to leave it
with tne tailor, as you will never have a
moment's satisfaction, if you have a proper
i pride in your appearance. Marcella.

THE
STAGE
Take a kaleidoscope and roll it in your
â¢oft and shapely hands. Apply an ob
servant eye to the end. One eye will do.
The other may be reserved for the con
templation of patrician ringers â your own,
of courseâ tapering away until they cul
minate in pink nails, delicately pink, if
you please, as a bit of a sundown scene.
Look so at yourself and at the phantasma
goric glories which glitter in the octagon
before you simultaneously. Baubles and
crowns, and perhaps crosses, tumble and
disappear. New combinations surprise,
delight or disappoint. Illusion of the
mirrors, this brave and candy show in
miniature, is nevertheless pleasing, al
though you know that you deceive your
self. "Ah, but," you say, "it is my pleas
ure to be deceived ; but I have not lost the
true sense of perspective, nor am I blind
to realities." No, indeed, the patrician
ringers and the pink nails are real. You
are real as you use the lorgnette; in
dubitably real as you weep over mimic
woes and are thrilled by stage pageantry.
You are as real as a rainbow and at your
dainty foot is really what is not at the
foot of any rainbow â & pot of gold. You
feed on illusions and the manager de
lights in having found a real gold-ledge
rainbow â you, fair lady, really you â backed
up by the coin of the realm which you
cheerfully expend for tickets.
And, come to think of it, that idea of
the kaleidoscope and of your own fair self
as the principal admirer of what is re
vealed is not inapplicable. Carmen, the
wicked, the entrancing; chic and fierce;
a moth fluttering toward the predestined
flame; a moth loving the sound of the
castanets â enraptured with the bolero.
You have seen Carmen and have sighed.
I beard you sigh as you raised your
daintily perfumed handkerchief, and not
only the sigh â some bright, saline drops
fell from your eyes! Then that quartet
in "Martha" and the "Last Rose of
Summer," type of so much that is I
pathetic, and all the rest of it. You were
there. Then you saw "Moths," as done
by the Frawley company. Turn the
kaleidoscope once more. I see you obey
and you smile and wonder at Biondi â
multi-personal Biondi. Why should you
not be pleased with "Irish Inspiration"?
Of course you will. '
Your own imagination was the combina
tion of mirrors which helped the glitter
ing dramatic fragments of the week to
take on their full measure of. delight.
Pleasing in themselves they relied upon
you to see them in the best possible light.
They relied not in vain. Sometimes you
so far forgot your pink nails, type of your
own self, roseate and polished, and gave
your undivided attention to the play.
That was when your personality was
stronger than your realization of that
entity. The skill of the stage people
played upon you as upon a many-stringed
harp; titillated and strummed upon your
heartstrings; poked out a fuzzy feather
at the region of your risibilities and
tickled you much until you laughed a
laugh tor which you gave yourself credit â
"jolly dogs, we are young yet," some of
you said; asked you to come again and
you will.
Of course you will go this week and
many of you will go the rounds and take
in varied attractions. That is turning the
kaleidoscope in real earnest. The crowns
and baubles are more exhilarating by their
very variety. The kaleidoscope is ready.
All the fragments have been gathered
within the septagonal limit of seven days
and they will glitter duly and at the
proper time. Below is some mention of
what you can see and hear during the
coming week.
At the Baldwin.
Charles Frohman's Empire Theater
Company will begin its three weeks' sea
son at the Baldwin Theater to-morrow
night by showing San Franciscans how
cleverly it can interpret light comedy. Its
first week will be devoted to representa
tions of Clyde Fitch's "Bohemia," which
is described as a bright and enlivening
peep into the precincts of Paris' Bohemian
days and nights. Indeed the play is cased
on Henri' Murger's series of sketches of
artist life in the Quartier Latin in Paris,
and as it is to this source that Dv Mau
riers "Trilby" may be referred there is
nothing unfair in stating that some of the
Eastern critics found Mr. Fitch's "Bohe
mia" a pleasanter and better play than
"Trilby. Mr. Fitch has taken some lib- ]
erties with the original story and gives it J
a more decidedly agreeable finishing than
Murgerdid. He has filled it with spark
' ling lines and up-to-dated the characters
so that they possess the flavor of Bohemia
anywhere. The entire first week at the
Baldwin will be given to "Bohemia." The
second wili bringthe company forward in
dramatic work, Pinero's "Benefit of the
Doubt" being set down for that week.
This play was successfully presented at
the Lyceum Theater in New York, and it
is by Daniel Frohman's permission that it
is presented here by tbe Empire stock com
pany. The third and last week wiil find
Charles frohman's players in that re
markable drama, by Henry Arthur Jones,
"The Masqueraders," in which they ap
peared for an entire season at the Empire
Theater. No matter what the circum
stances attending either of these produc
tions the scnedule here set down will not
be changed, a full week being given to
each of the three plays in the company's
present repertory. Mr. Frohman has in
creased, tne membership of his organiza
tion, which now includes Miss Viola j
Allen, Annie Irisb. Ida Conquest, Mrs. |
Thomas Whiffen. May Robson, Jane Har
war, Elien Gail, Katherine Muikins, Lottie
Nichoil, William Faversham, J. E. Dod
son, Robert Edeson. Ferdinand Gotts
chalk, E Y. Backus, W. H. Crompton, J. E.
Finney, Charles Young, Walter Day and
George C. Pierce. It is one of the two
surviving stock companies now in Ameri
ca and has gathered favor in the seven
years of its existence until now it is se
curely established in tbe popular heart.
"Bohemia" will serve for a pleasant intro
duction of some of the new people in the
organization.
jkt the Galiforrvia Theater.
It is an exceptionally strong bill which
the management of the California Thea
ter offers for the farewell week of the
stock season at that house, commencing
to-morrow (Monday) night. This bill, a
superb scenic revival of Shakespeare's
"The Merchant of Venice," will serve to
bring oui. all that is best in tbe company
now playing at that theater. It is natural
to expect a correct and charming inter
pretation of the play when tbe principal
characters are entrusted to such celebri- '
ties as Frederick Warde and Rose Coghlan
and the minor roles to the Stock well play- i
ers. As a Shakespearean . actor Frederick
Warde has no equal to-day. He is the |
most popular legitimate player on the j
stage and has won his position by the ex
cellence of his work at all times. His
productions have always been of the high
est standard, and his portrayals of such
roles as Marc Antony, King Lear, lago,
Virginius, Richard 111, etc., have won for
him fame and lor tune. ' He has as yet to
give San Francisco theater-goers their first
opportunity of seeing his Shylock, and his
appearance in that role to-morrow night is
sure to prove an interesting event in our
theatrical annals. That he will prove
more than usually brilliant in this part
goes without saying. Rose Coghlan
can claim most .rightly the honor
of being one of the very few capable
Shakespearean readers in this country.
Her appearances in the legitimate in this
City have been very few, but we have nad
the pleasure of seeing an exceptionally
fine Rosalind , when she appeared in the
open-air performance of "As You Like It"
at Sutro Heights last year. She has also
given us a most beautiful Olivia in "The
Twelfth Night," and her charming worK in
that role bids fair to be outdone when she
makes her appearance as Portia in the
coming production â¢of "The Merchant of
Venice." The character calls for that
class of work in ; which : Miss Coghlan
excels and she will impart to it a dash and
charm that will be most taking. Prepara
tions for a beautiful staging of the play
have been going on for some time and the
production on Monday night will be given
with historically correct costumes and
scenery, prepared especially for the occa
sion. The musical numbers to be played
during the progress of the piece are all
original and decidedly brilliant. . There is
to be both vocal and instrumental music.
Parlors Olympus and Presidio, N. S.

day night. The cast of "The Merchant of

. Columbia Jheater.
' The past : week has been a notable one at
the Columbia Theater. On several occa
sions the orchestra was put out of sight
to make room for the crowds. For the
week commencing with to-morrow even
ing the Frawley Company will present
another New York . Lyceum Theater suc
cess, John Madison Morton's excellent
comedy, "The Highest Bidder," which
had a run of over eight months in * that
city, s Mr. Morton has undoubtedly writ
ten more successful English farces 'than
any playwright of his time, and "The
Highest Bidder" â¢ is ' his very best work.
The story of the play is an unusually in
teresting one. . Lawrence Thorn hill, the
father of the heroine. Rose, has become j
financially embarrassed, and in order that j
his daughter may not .be without the
dowry he has intended giving her he de
termines fo sell the ; family : estates, the
Larches. With this object he invites Jack
Hammerton, a London auctioneer, to the
Larches.- Jack falls in love with Rose the
instant he meets her and at the same time
discovers " her likely to become the
affianced., bride ol â¢ Sir' 'Evelyn â¢ Graine,
whom he recognizes as a scoundrel and
rogue and with whose motives and meth
ods he is already familiar. -
In his desperation , at such a possibility
he makes a too hasty, attempt to - warn
Rose and paint ' Sir,' Evelyn to her. in his
true colors, and as a result loses her con
fidence and the esteem of her friends. The
sale takes place ; the "Larches" is bought
in by Hammerton himself, and again his
motives are misconstrued by Rose and her
friends, who do not know that Hammer
ton has taken the deed in Lawrence Thorn
hill's name. In the closing act Jack at
last succeeds in unmasking Sir >. Evelyn, 1
and also in convincing Rose that his love
for her has been the motive underlying ail
his actions, and the feeling against the
tradesman having been overborne by the
admiration for the man Jack is accepted as !
the husband of Rose and tbe future i
master of the "Larches." .
The role of Jack Hammerton will afford
Mr. Worthing excellent ., scope for the dis
play of his talents. The character is itself
very pleasant and interesting throughout
and in the hands lof Mr. Worthing it will
be doubly so. The Frawley company have
been making special preparations for this
production and the play is cast as follows:

A star attraction is announced , for the
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
comineweek at this house in A. C. Gunter's
world-famous story. "Mr. Barnes of New
York." The title role is to be played by
James M. Brophy, who, since making his.
debut some years ago in this his native
city, has earned considerable fame
throughout the East. In this particular
role he is said to have no peer.
The whole force of the stock company,
with several additions â in musical and
dramatic talent â wiil support the star.
Gorgeous scenery has been prepared and
every accessory has been provided to make
the production a signal success. Mr. Gun-
ter's book will be closely followed, so that
it will be a play with a California play
wright and a California star.
The WeeU at the JiVoli.
The repertoire announced for the fourth
week of the grand ooera season at the
Tivoli Opera-house, under the direction of
Gustav Hinrichs, is as follows: Monday.
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday eveningn,
by special request, Bizet's .Spanish chef
d'ouvre, "Carmen," with Mme. Natali as
the Gypsy, Signor de Vries as the torea
dor, a role he made his greatest success in
last season at the Metropolitan Opera
house when Mm". Calve sang the title
role, and Signor Michelena as Don Jose,
the soldier. The other roles will be in the
hands of Anna Schnabel. Irene Mulle.
Katherine Loornis, Richnrd Karl, Marcel
Perron, Arthur Boyce and W. H. Tooker.
On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday
evenings Gounod's immortal opera,
"Faust," will be given, with Signor
Michelena in the title role. Signor Abra
rnoff as Meptiisto, J. J. Raffael as Valen
tine and Nina Bertini Humphreys as
Marguerite. Both operas will be pre
sented in a careful manner. "Aida,"
"The Hugenots," "The Masked Ball" and
a revival of "Cavalleria Rusticana," with
"Pagliacci," are in preparation for early
presentation.
Jhe Orpheum.
The particularly bright star at the
Orpheum* is the great Biondi, wno is well
entitled to the privilege of styling himself
"the only." His clever work as a char
acter change artist has made him the talk
of theater-goers. His 'pantomime acting
is so excellent that his comedy sketch is a
great hit, even though but few in the
audience understand a word that is said.
That one should be able to make such
rapid changes from one character to an
other, often from male to female and vice
versa, is quite beyond belief, and to see
Biondi in his changes is a treat. He has
new work to introduce this week. Of the
new attractions a sensation is promised in
Herr Techow, who comes from the Empire
Theater, London, with what is said to be
the greatest troupe of trained cats in tbe
world. They take the place on the bill
made vacant by Macart's dog and monkey
circus.
A cat circus, on the staze at least, is a
novelty, and it ought to be a drawing
card, particularly as it is said that Herr
Techow's cats do some very clever things.
They obey him and perform the most diffi
cult tricks, seemingly as though they en
joyed standing on tbeir'heads, jumping
through noops of fire, walKing tight ropes,
boxing matches, etc. Lydia Yeamans-
Titus and F. J. Titus are billed to appear,
and neither of them need any introduc
tion to San Francisco. Mrs. Titun will in
troduce new character songs and a few
dances. With Biondi, Lydia Yeamans-
Titus, the .Masons, Vadis sisters, Wash
burne sisters, Ross Snow Mnd other favor
ites on tbe bill the packed houses at the
Orpheum should continue. Matinees on
every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.
At the Ghutes.
Always on tbe lookout for novelties the
Chutes management has secured "Joe," the
only orang-outang in America, and he is
on exhibition every afternoon and evening.
The animal is possessed of an intelligence
almost human, and the acts he does are
not the stereotyped tricks of the ordinary
trained monkey. He seems to compre
hend every word spoken to him by. tbe
visitors, as well as his trainer, and he has
an element of humor in his composition
that is always uppermost.
The programmes given twice a day in
tbe casino are meeting with great favor
and tbe attendance is uniformly large.
As an additional attraction Miss Essie
Viola, the daring young aeronaut, will
make a balloon ascension and parachute
drop at halt-past 4 o'clock this afternoon
from the Haight-street grounds.
Jheatrical Atoms.

Applause
At tke Jkeater
Is Wror\g
Deep Silence Is the
Highest Praise ir\
Tragedy or
Drama
"Modern theater-goers have been so
much indulged by those who cater to and
provide their amusement that they fail to
perceive that they frequently impose nob
only upon managers and actors but upon
a majority of their fellow-auditors," saya
Frederick Warde, the tragedian.
"One of the most prevalent of the petty .
yet greatly discomfiting practices in
dulged in is that of applauding at the
stage of the play where silence is abso
lutely requisite to make effective a scene.
'Another is the disruption of a har
monious idea and artistic, continuity of the
olay by the recall of the stars immediately
after a brilliant or impressive display of
simulation.
"A third is the premature preparations
made for leaving the auditorium when the
finale of the play is approaching.
"These annoying manifestations are al
ways detrimental to the full and proper
enjoyment of the majority and more de
corous of the spectators, but they are
made more marked when attendant upon
the production of the legitimate drama,
wherein the deepest passions of human
nature are portrayed.
"All actors of the highest rank have of
late endeavored to discourage these un
timely demonstrations, but invariably with
little success, and they have been dis
agreeably present at times in San Fran
cisco.
"That the more intelligent of the au
dience do not indulge in these exhibitions
was observable during the presentations
at the California during the past week,
and that they condemn them was made
clear by their uttered displeasure after the
play of those who participated in them.
"There seems to be no effectual remedy
for these inappropriate and inopportune
plaudits. While in a measure naturally
gratifying to the artist, they are undesir
able in the highest degree and can only be
viewed as signs of ill breeding and bad
taste.
"It has always been my personal en
deavor to discourage them, but how -to do
so without giving offense is a'problem still
to be solved. I find that it is much the
better course to gratify the unthinking
who insist on recalling the artist. It is
the quickest and least disagreeable way to
put a stop to their clamor.
"Personally every artist prefers to main
tain his impersonated character through
out a play without interruption. It per
mits him to do better justice, to his role by
presenting to his audience an unbroken
and, therefore, artistic delineation of the
part, and adds almost inconceivably to the
enjoyable impression made on the people
he is seeking to please.
"To be compelled suddenly and inappro
priately to cast off the simulatad charac
ter and appear in propria persona is
always as undesirable as inartistic. But
the public is an ungrateful creature and
refusal to respond to its requests is viewed
as a display of churlishness. If they, how
ever, best consulted their pleasure and
chat of the artist they would absolutely
refrain from doing that which certainly
though unconsciously lessens the full
measure of their enjoyment and adds
nothing to the gratitude of him they seek
to honor. All demonstrations of approval
should be withheld until after the final
drop of the curtain.
"Applause at the climax of a scene of
solemnity which demands absolute quiet
is one of the most distasteful and em
barrassing manifestations that the actor
has to encounter. Such eruptions are as
incongruous as cheers in a place of wor
ship during an invocation. Yet they are
frequent, I regret to say.
"As I said before, there appears to be no
remedy unless one has the hardihood to
offend one's admirers and patrons. Edu
cating the general public up to a true ap
preciation of the demands of dramatic
situations is a herculean and I judge an
almost impossible task, yet it may be
done, and I hope at the same time to be
able to do my share toward bringing it
about. Audiences are like the individual,
however, and always " prefer something
delectable, no matter how injurious, to
something bitter, despite the highly bene
ficial results that may come from the
latter. '
"lean say this, though, of San Fran
cisco audiences, that while their apprecia
tion is even more marked than that shown
elsewhere they are less frequently guilty
of these offenses. Then they have the ad
ditional incentive of personal friendly feel
ing for me, having seen and known me for
many years while I performed at other
theaters in this City.
"Indiscriminate applause during the
presentation of a tragedy is the result of a
habit acquired by attendance at other
classes of amusements. Many people thus
become imbued with the idea that the
only way to signify the measure of their

approval ia by the length and volume
of their applause. This, however, is
a mistake. That deep silence which
results from rapt interest is the greatest
compliment that can be paid to an artist's
ability. There is no fear that the quiet
resulting from the audience being deeply
moved will be mistaken by the actor for
ihe cold silence of indifference. He has
the audience always in full view, and the
veriest novice can readily discern whether
his audience is en rapport with him or
distrait.
"Why people will persist in making
ready to leave the theater before the cur
tain is rung down is a mystery. The most
interesting climax and tableau of the
whole play is thereby spoiled, and all they
gain is perhaps half a minute in reaching
their carriage or car.- This last is the most
inexcusable yet the most prevalent of all
these exhibitions.
"When George Rignold played in this
City some years ago he publicly expressed
his views against this unmannerly habit.
On one occasion he became so enraged
that he abruptly abandoned i.is part, ad
vanced to the center of the stage and
shouted to the stage-manager, 'Ring down
the curtain till these people catch their
bus; then we will proceed with the play.'
This was done. The offenders became
abashed, settled quietly back in their seats
and the play was concluded without fur
ther marring effect.
"If people will insist on showing their
appreciation by applause -they should
withhold it till the curtain falls at the end
of the act, or, better still, tilt the final
drop of the curtain."

CANNED SALMON.
. The Cutting Packing Company's circular says Of
canned salmon : "Trade continues of a distribu
tive character, and shipments bein; made are
from the packing on the Columb'a River; are
mainly in fulfillment of engagements made earlier
in the season, and tills variety of salmon Is all that
Is as yet received from this year's product, save a
very small pack on the Sacramento and Kogue'
rivers. No new Alatka packed fish is to be looked
for until early in *ep ember. The work at can
neries on the Columbia Hiver is being prose
cuted with v cor, and the fishermen. who, early in
the season, refus-d to work, except at extreme
prices for their catch, are now busy and doing well
On a compromise scale of values. The catch is. of
course, ir<ucii smaller than at corresponding date
of last season, and to the Ist inst. is estimated at
150.000 cases of Chinook fish. The run of blue
backs hits been small and disappointing. â  -: .
Fishing in British' Columbia has commenced and
the catch is satisfactory, tbdugh at some points
packing has been interfered with by unreasonable
demands of fishermen ior excessive prices of raw
fish.

Inferior quality of fish found in those waters, but
as these goods are marketed at les-. prices than the

trade and the business Induces the erection of new
canneries year y. It is expected that a vessel will
be placed on berth on the Columbia for the United
Kingdom, to sail last' of August, which will take
such of the pack as may have that destination.
WINE EXPORTS?;
Expo: of wine from California during the first
six months of 1896 were 8,349,838 gallons, against
8,3: 2, VI 3 gallons during the same period in 11:95.
These figures show a decrease in the product of the
State, due id causes familiar to every oue, namely,
phylloxera and frost, and a consequent advance iv
prices, and a tendency to bold on to stocks. The
exports .1) June were only 688.000 Kallui.s. against
1,377.500 gallons In June. 1805. Up to June there

of their own leaders tor the Vice-Presidency, in
stead of tauing up : the nominations of th 2 Chicago
convention, led. to a strong opening at the Stock
k-xchan re., It was argued by the bulls that this
would probably prevent a fusion with foe Demo
crats, and to this extent was favorable to the cause
of sound money. . A report that McKtnley'a leter
or acceptance would contain a strong indorsement
ot tne gold standard also induced purchases for
both accounts, and the fact that there were no coin
Shipments, owing to the sianJ taken by the bank
in. interests of the country, also had some Influ
ence on the market.
London, however, was a seller, but purchasers,
especially at the opening, were numerous, and
s.ocks offered by the foreigners made no Impres
sion on values, and in fact prices actually ad
vanced anywhere from to 3 per cent. "Lake

cent. The sharp rise induced realizations in the
closing trading, and the improvement was partially
lost. Ihe bank statement, which was but imper
fectly understood by the average trader, caused
some selling at this time.
The decrease in deposits Of over 2,000.000,
which was most commented upon, it is bald, was
the result of the recent withdrawal of European
money in in? shape of cold exports and the con
traction in loans. Speculation closed barely

.CHICAGO, 11.1,. July 25 Wheat developed
strength to-day from two causes, the wet weather
in England and bad crop reports from tbe North
west. Other bull factors were the small Argen-

red winter wheat and good shipments from both
coasts, 3,073,000 bushels. Receipts at tbe North
west were heavy at 309 cars. Last Saturday the;

DRIED FRUITSâ . /
It is useless to disguise the fsct that the more
sensitive fruits, such as Peaches and Prunes, have
been badly damaged In the central and San Joa
quin sections by the. hot weather of a week ago.
From all points south of Han Francisco come re
ports of Injury, and tbe opinion among dealers Is
that the output will be less than expected a month
ago. a well known lccai Dried Fruit house, wish
ing to learn the exact state of affairs from the
growers themselves, several days ago sent out
large numbers of inquiries, and ' the responses gen
erally showed a decreased yield. The following
letter from a &anta C:ara orchardlst is given as a
sample:
"I will not have any Dried Fruit to sell at the
present outlook. My fruit generally goes through
the driers. as regards my crop of Apricots, I will
not have over IV* tons of green fruit on 300 13
--v ear-old trees. The frost caught the fruit in this
vicinity. The hot weather has checked the growth
of Peaches and Prunes. In this neighborhood the
Prunes are wilting and dropping off the trees. 1 Tbe
canneries Â«re bringing freely of Apricots, conse
quently there wi 1 not be so many dried, Crops
of Peaches. Apricots and Prunes, taking tbe coun
ty over, are lighter than were expected. The
fruit is spotted, some having good crops and others
about nothing. I live in tbe vicinity of terry
I also have a Prune ranch m ar Saratoga, on which
is a two-thirds crop of large Prunes. I hear the
Prunes above los Gatos are ' failing. There was a
good crop of Prunes below Santa Clara, neat Law
rence Station, before the hot spell came on.
â¢â¢Last Wednesday I rode throueh lO.otO acres of
orchards, from r-an Jose to Campbells and to Sara
toga. Almost all the Apricots 1 saw .were small,
being early varieties. There was no fruit of the
other varieties to speak of. The Prunes were gen
erally of fair size, but thin on the trees, several ex
ceptions having gool crops." -1
New Prunes wen? decidedly firm, with sales of
the four sizes at 3%@4c. tbe tendency being up
ward. Prunes 111 not be cheap this year from the
present outlook, as the crops in France,* Servla,
Bosnia, etc.. are reported short and not looking
well, owing to unfavorable weather.
Local dealers report trade good, with old fruit
passing steadily out of first hands.

UNITED STATES
MERCHANT MARINE,
A Movement Toward the
Restoration of Our Flag
Upon the Seas.
Proposed Legislation for an
Auxiliary Navy Ocean
Mail Service.
Some of the Strong Features of the
Measure Set Forth by Fred S.
Samuels.
There is naturally widespread interest
in this country, particularly in the twenty
two States bordering on the ocean, in the
proposed Congressional measure "to pro
vide for an auxiliary navy ocean mail
service, and to promote commerce," and
the time seems near at hand when the
Government of the United States will no
longer sit supinely indifferent to its mari
time interests, and when it will rise up
and spurning the apathetic policy of the
present proceed to develop ana hold to
the benefit of its people that boundless
wealth of the seas which is by nature
largely theirs. An able treatise on the
proposed act has been written by Fred
erick S. Samuels of this City, under the
title, "Our Merchant Marine."
AMuming (says Mr. Samuels) that the United
States has at last awakened to the absolute
necessity of legislating in favor of shipping;
that It recognizes the advantage of furnishing
men 'is of employment to thousands of artisans
in shipyards and in all the kindred trades; of
opening to the American youth a seafaring
car< or, with its possibilities for earning a live
lilir'>d, with prospects for promotion, carrying
wit â¢â¢ it the education in discipline, nautical
anr" engineering affairs necessary to form efli
cic;)'. crews for the manning of our navy in
eve-'t of war; of opening to the merchant, the
far; er and the manufacturer new trade fields
whii:h now follow the foreign flag; of offering
to 'tie capitalist, large or small, new oppor
tunities for investment; and last but not least
in i mportance, of retaining in this country a
por ion at least of the hundreds of millions of
American gold which flows annually into the
pockets of foreign ship-owners in the form of
far â¢Â» and freightsâ it. only then becomes neces
sary to decide on what form legislation should
tak'i to accomplish these results.
\n hen we launch out in the attempt to re-
Btot-e the American flag on the ocean, the plan
adopted must be such as will hi imulate the
construction of speedier and better steam ves
sel.*- for the various trades than our competi
tor*. There must be a reward for regularity,
frequency and speed of voyages. Faster time
in t.'ie transmission oi mftiU, valuable freight,
specie and passengers, means diversion to this
country oi a vast portion of the business which
now flow* past us, influenced and assisted by
the liberal subsidies and bounties paid by
foreign Governments to their vessels.
Oving to the numberless opportunities
which have presented themselves for the de
velopment of our internal resources, we have
been ignoring the necessity of pushing our
commercial relations with foreign countries,
to the end that we might avail ourselves to the
utmost of the advantage which our vast re
sources give us. The result is that we are now
confronted with the fact that Europe has, by
peaceful methods, i. c., by furnishing trans
portation, secured almost the entire trade of
South America, while we have contented our
selves with reading the "Monroe doctrlue" to
such nations as have manifested any intention
of seizing its soil.
Of what advantage to us is the position of
protector to our southern neighbors if they are
gradually being Europeanized by the inexor
able laws of trade? Not a single steamship
under the American flag is employed in trade
with South American States other than Vene
zuela and Colombia; and on the Pacific Coast
not a solitary steamer leaves the United States
for a South American port.
Mr. Samuels shows the total inadequacy
of the laws now in effect bearing upon our
shipping interests, and maintains that the
essential features of any proposition for the
restoration of our flag upon the ocean
must contemplate:
Firstâ Some consideration in return for Gov
ernmental support.
Secondâ Reasonable security for the capital
invested and labor employed against changes
in administrative policies.
Thirdâ Freedom in the selection of trades in ;
which vessels may engage without vitiating
their right to compensation.
Fourthâ No discrimination in favor of any
individual or corporation.
Fifthâ lt must be liberal in its provisions to
Induce immediate results.
The proposed remedial bill has been drawn
with a view of meeting the foregoing require
ments, and while it embodies some of the best
featurai of the act of March 3, 1891 ["To pro
vide for ocean mail service between the United
States and foreign ports and to promote com
merce"] it differs radically from others, partic
ularly in the elimination of the mail-contract
system, which in practice subordinates the
shipping interests to the opinion of the Post
master-General.
The proposed bill provides for the free
transportation of the United States mail
to foreign countries; for the transporta
tion at half the regular rates of all naval
officers, troops, seamen or supplies to or
from foreign ports; for the carrying on
each steamship of one American- born boy
apprentice for each 1000 tons registered
tonnage, such boy to be educated in the
duties of seamanship, etc. ; that all steam
ships shall be of iron or steel and so con*
structed as to enable them to be promptly
and economically converted into auxiliary
naval cruisers. The steamships are to be
divided into four classes, according to rate
of speed and amouqt of tonnage, the com
pensation ranging from $5 to $1 per nauti
cal mile by the shortest practicable route
for each outward voyage. Such steamers
may be taken and used by the United
States as transports or cruisers upon pay
ment to the owners of the fair value at the
time of the taking, and if there is a disa
greement as to the fair value between the
! United States and the owners of the vessel
it shall be determined by impartial ap
praisement.
With reference to the question of security
for capital invested and labor employed
against changes of administration the pro
posed act authorizes the Secretary of the
Treasury to enter into contract with tue
owner or owners of each steamship ap
proved under the terms of this act (which
contract shall designate the classification
and compensation), and that contract Is to
remain in force for a period of ten years,
always provided that the requirements of
the act are complied with.
Such a measure offers to the country an
auxiliary navy, always ready in time of
war, while enriching the country in times
of peace. The annual cost of maintaining
a tirst-class cruiser amounts to not less
than $250,000; this amount of money
would support a fleet of merchant steam
ers.
The liberal conditions of this bill would
stimulate ship- building to such an extent
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1896.
that the cost of construction would shortly
be lowered so much as to enable the ship
owner to operate with lerÂ«s support from
Ihe Government. What a high tarff has
done for steel rails a liberal subsidy can
do for ships. With having our share of
the ocean trade, there would come the re
tention in this country of a large portion
of the millions in gold paid to England
foi transportation, besides the diversion
to this country of trade which now flows
past us under foreign flags.
Mr. Samuels concludes his paper with
the following comprehensive paragraph:
The cost to the Government of this law,
were it $10,000,000 per annum, would be triv
ial in comparison to the benefits it would be
stow. It has been estimated that 132 different
industries contribute to the building and
equipment of a steamship. These industries
in turn have others dependent upon them,
end in addition to this is the direct labor em
ployed in construction and navigation. Could
protection be afforded to any other industry
that would be so far-reaching and beneficial in
effect? Could any National enterprise within
the scope of constitutional legislation be sug
gested that could compete with more favor for
congressional action than this? A law that
-hows no section, no class, no single industry,
and which will infuse new Hie and patriotism
throughout the length and breadth of the land,
cannot be measured in the scales against ap
propriations demanded by Congressmen for
their backwoods constituency, or by the
amount of protection accorded to a syndicate
of monopolist manufacturers. The law must
be as liberal as the grandeur of its object de
mands, and its cost in operation will return to
tbs people through widely diversified chan
nels. ___________________

New Edifice of the Howard Church, at the Corner of Oak and Baker Stie.ts Which Will Ec *> cd -"
cated Next Sunday. The Church Is of Gray Stone, and Was 1 uilt Wi h a View of
Future Extensions.
HOWARD CHURCH
ABOUT TO MOVE.
Will Occupy a Handsome
New Edifice Near the
Park.
Will Take Leave of the Old
Mission-Street Chapel This
Morning.
The New Site Faces the Panhandle.
The Church Building Wi'l
Cost Fu ly $i 6,000
For the last time the little chapel on
Mission street, near Third, which over
twenty-five years ago first housed a wor
shiping congregation, will be used this
morning for services by the Howard
Presbyterian Church. There will be noth
ing characteristic in the services, but to
thoBS members of the congregation who
first worshiped in the little edifice when
it was situated near First and Natoma
streets, then within easy reach of the
fashionable residence portion of the City,
there will be a touch of pathos in their Ja3t |
farewell to the little chapel.
Whatever sadness mar be occasioned by j
such reminiscences, however, should bo
more than dispelled by the thought of the
handsome new edifice which the congre
gation will occupy a few weeks from to-day. '
The new church" building at the corner of !
Baker ana Oak streets is now completed,
and it is one of the most beautiftil
structures of the kind in the city.
Its location is superb, and the price paid
for the lot, $18,000, is not dear when tne i
attractions of the spot are considered. Im
mediately opposite the churcu is the en
trance to the Park panhandle.
This insures an open prospect, and sur- '
rounding the church are fine residence |
properties. The edifice itself is of rare j
architectural beauty. In its construction
a view has been had to future extensions,
but present beauty has not been sacrificed
to this, and the edifice as it stands to-day
is a finished and complete structure.
There is an aspect of solidity about it
which does not belie the facts, for it is
constructed of gray stone. The broken
ashler work gives the building a most
pleasing appearance.
Within a more cosy meeting place could I
not be imagined. The auditorium will |
accommodate 500 persons, so arranged '
that they can be addressed from the pulpit
without calling for any vocal strain.
At each side is a partially inclosed j
gallery, which will be hung with elecant
portieres and will be used as a classroom
when not needed as an adjunct to tne
auuitorium. A feature of tue church is
the beautiful glazing. The windows are
stained, a iight amber, with just colored
figures enough to give an artistic effect
without retarding a flood of soft, mellow
light. Beautiful chandeliers are provided
for lighting, and Baily reflectors will send
back a brilliant glow from the electric
lights. The main congregation-room is
carpeted in a soft red, which contrasts
pleasingly with the natural wood furnish
ings. A handsome pipe organ is in place
behind the pulpit.
To the right of the auditorium is a
smaller room, designed to be used as an
infant classroom. This is provided with
rolling partitions, so that in emergencies
it can be thrown into the main room.
The basement is fitted up for a prayer- ,
meeting room, a ladies' parlor, kitchen, !
I pantry, etc. The ladies' parlor, which is j
| to be the scene of many sociables, has a
j big, open fireplace in one corner. This is
I a beautiful affair of Roman brick and
carved stone, and gives the room at once
an elegant and a home-like appearance.
Next Sunday will occur the dedication
} services and tbe pastor, Key. fountain R.
Farrand, states with justifiable pride, that j
contrary to the usual custom, there will
j be no collection taken to pay church
| debts. The new edifice, exclusive of the
I lot, cost $16,000, but the price paid for the
I Mission-street property was so much in
excess of that paid for the present site,
that the margin went well toward paying
building expenses. The large edifice on
Mission street, wh^h the congregation for
merly used, has been sold and is now being
torn down. They still own the chapel ad- j
1 joining the old church, at which services I
will be held this morning for the last j
time. They will continue to maintain a j
j Sunday-echool there.
The region where the new church is lo
i cated is particularly deficient in church
edifices. In the whole Panhandle district
there is no other Protestant church, and
Dr. Farrand expects to build up a large
! congregation. His present church mcm
i bers were unanimous In their advocacy of
1 the present location. Many of them live
j in the western part of town and it was a
I great hardship lor them to travel so far to
j service.
