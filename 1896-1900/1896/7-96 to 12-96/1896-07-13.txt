DETROIT, Mich., July 12.â The Free
Press, the leading Democratic newspaper
oi Eastern Michigan, to-day announced
that it will not indorse the Chicago piat
form or candidates. The Free Press says:
Waiving any discussion as to the methods
used in securing the adoption of that plat
form, we denounce the monetary, utterance as
mi-Democratic and fraught with serious men
ace to the country and its prosperity. Believ
ing this, there is no alternative course possible
for the Free Press but the sacrifice of honest
conviction, and that sacrifice we cannot make.
The Free Press declares itself to be hereaiter
free from any party connection.
The Detroit Tribune (R.) had previously
bolted the St. Louis platform and de
clared for free silver.
The Grand Rapids Democrat, the lead
ing Democratic newspaper of western
Michigan, which favored gold before the
convention, accepts the platform, declares
that the platform is the accepted creed of
the party for this campaign , and says
Democrats who don't like it can find com
fort and company on the Republican side
of the fence.
CHICAGO. 111., July 12.â Chicago
Chronicle (D.) in a double-leaded editorial
says: Â» â
i "It is necessary that the Democrats of
the United States should call another
convention. The one held in the Coliseum
â  Â»Â£"â . Obiesi'O bÂ« â  beeu. controlled: -by tbr,
foes 'of Â« commerce, of labor, . of 7 Bound
finance â .' and of Democracy. It â  has no
claim to the title 'Democratic' The duty
devolves upon the Democratic leaders who
' have been ignored, reviled and scuffed at
by the enemies of Democracy- in the
Coliseum, gathering to issue a call for a
real Democratic convention. : Ample time
remains for the assembling of such a con
vention. With proper concert of action
among the leaders of Democracy in the
various States the preliminaries can be
arraneed at once and the convention can
be held not later than September 1. The
Democrats of the country have not been
represented at Chicago. They have been
. delivered into the hands of their enemies.
They must meet and organize against
their forces. Let another convention be
called."
S NEW HAVEN, Conn., July 12.â
New Haven Register says concerning the
Bryan nomination:
it was a characteristic performance from
all point.-- of view. The platform, which is a
i;iiis of reckless statements and false con
clusions, disclosed as nothing else could the
irresponsibility of the majority. It required
but a graceful dancer to whirligig upon It to
impart to It the atmosphere of romance and
pission, which it lacked .of Itself.' The ac
complished dancer came in the person of Mr.
Bryan. His graceful and sensuous movement,
liie charming poise of the limb, the flash of
the eye and the music of the voice set the
audience on tire.
It turned to him from the older and stiffer
dancer with the ardor and desire of flcile
youth. It abandoned its. old premiere dan
teuse. Mile. Bland, who for so many years'
twirled on her sliver toes, to the uproarious
delight of these same advocates of the political
ballet.
DAVENPORT, lowa, July 12. â The
Davenport Democrat will not support the
free-silver ticket An editorial printed to
day says:
- It is painful to see a party which leu than
four years ago was indorsed by such an over
whelming majority in the election of its leader
to the Presidency now abandon the principles
which led to this most signal triumph. n '
OGDEN, Utah, July 12.â The Ogden
Standard, the tinst paper in the then Ter

of Mormon and anti-Mormon factions in
politics and' the dividing upon National
lines and the paper which gave birth to
the State Republican organization when
the division came, thif morning places
the name of William J. Bryan at the head
of its editorial columns and announces its
allegiance to tne Democratic party.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 12. âThe Sun
day Union, the Irish society or^an in this
city, in an editorial says:
"The Union is in close contact with the
industrial masses of city and country and
the almost universal disposition among
working and industrial classes is to support
Bryan square, straight and vigorously for
the Presidency."
LACROSSE, Wis., July 12.â This morn

DEPENDS UPON NEW YORK
Administration Leaders Undecided
as to the Launching of a
Second Ticket.
WASHINGTON. D. C, July 12.-The
administration leaders were fully prepared
for a free-coinage platform, but they have
notvdecided what position they shall as
sume toward it. Personally, none of the
men of influence who surround President
Cleveland approve either the candidates
or the platform adopted at Chicago. They
do not hesitate in private conversation to
say so, but they are undetermined
whether it were better to nominate a sec
ond ticket representing bound money
The San Francisco Call
views or combine with the Republicans in
support of McKinlev.
Generally speakine, a second ticket is
thought to be inadvisable. It is thought
that by dividing the sound-money vote
the cause itself would be placed in jeo
pardy. It is argued, on the other hand, that
this would prove a source of strength to
the cold standard, inasmuch as many
sound-money Democrats would give their
adhesion to such a ticket who might
otherwise vote for Bryan as a matter of
party loyalty. There is a disposition on
the part of some of the administration
leaders to await the report of the New
Yorkers, particularly Messrs. Whitney,
Flower and others, who returned East
yesterday. It is thought that since these
gentlemen spent a week at Chicago, min
gling freely with representative men in
both wings of the party, they are better
fitted to judge the line of policy to be fol
lowed than those at Washington, who are
dependent for their information upon the
daily press.
CHICAGO'S QUIETSABBATH.
Few Politicians Found at the Scene
of the Late Political
Strife.
CHICAGO, 111., July 12.â The usual
Sunday calm, more noticeable because
of the contrast with the turmoil of last
week, prevailed to-day in the big hotels
where the delegates had reigned supreme.
The gold and the silver representatives of
the Democratic party, with few excep
tions, departed for their homes on the
late trains yesterday and at all hours to
day. The multitude of visitors went
with them and the scenes of political
conflict were almost deserted to-day.
Nearly all the prominent delegates
have gone, the principal exceptions being
the members of the notification commit
tee and the National Committee, which
have business to finish here.
For the gold and silver leaders who re
mained in town it was a day of rest, the
latter being mostly confined to driving
with friends. Ex-Chairman Harrity spent
the afternoon that way and there was no
effort made to hold any conference of
the gold men. The intense heat was not
conducive to indoor work aud there are
not enough gold-standard delegates here
to get up a respectable conference on the
third-ticket question.
Colonel J. W. St. Clair of West Virginia,
who made an eloquent pica in the conven
tion for Senator Hill as temporary chair
man, although a silver advocate, said to
night at the Palmer House to a United
Press reporter:
"I do not think Hill will have anything
to do with another convention. That is
the impression I got from my last talk
with him. There are extremists in New
York and New England, however, who
may force another ticket in the field. I
have not any idea who would be put up.
The Eastern delegates did not want to do
anything hastily on such a ques
tion. It means the disruption of the Dem
ocratic party if another ticket is put up."
The committee of three, representing
the gold-standard Democrats of Illinois,
expects to have its public address in be
naif of another convention ready for pub
lication in a day or two. â¢
LINCOLNITES ARE ANGRY.
Believe Thqt the Nominees Should
Not Be Notified In New
York.
LINCOLN, Nebe., July 12.â There was a
feeling of keen disappointment, not un
mixed with some resentment, among Lin
coln people when the news was read this
mornineof the action of the Democratic
National Committee in determining to
have the two candidates of the party for
mally notified of their nominations at New
York City instead of at their respective
homes. Citizens of Lincoln had aireauy
begun planning for what it was confidently
predicted would be an epoch in the city's
history, and the action of the committee
was an unpleasant surprise. State and
local pride is at a high pitch, and it was
hoped that the managers of Mr. Bryan's
campaign, or such of them a? are on the
notification committee, would befgiven an
opportunity to see the enthusiasm which
the action at the Chicago convention had
aroused.
This determination will not, however,
have any effect on the demonstration and
reception of Mr. and Mrs Bryan on their
return home, which promises to be the
greatest of the kind ever held in the State.
At the meeting last night it was agreed
to make it an entirely non-partisan affair
and this is emphasized by the fact that on
the different committees leading Repub
licans dominate in the membership. Ex
cursions will be run to the city from every
point in the State and delegations will be
present not only from Nebraska* cities and
towns, but from Colorado, lowa, Kansas
and Missouri.
The nomination of Mr. Bryan was re
ferred to by pastors of the different
churches to-day, notably in the First
Presbyterian, of which the Democratic
nominee is a member and where he is an
enthusiastic worker in the Sunday-school.
All reference to him was of a congratu
latory nature.
The city was not without its usual
demonstration, on a subdued scale, being
due to the arrival at 5 p. m. of the Nebraska
delegation from the convention. They
were met at the depot by a large crowd
and marched to headquarters with flags
and Bryan banners flowing. It will be an
unusually dull day in Lincoln from now
until the novelty wears off when there is
not some demonstration in honor of the
Democratic candidate.
IT MEANS REVOLUTION.
Chairman Mark Hanna's Views on
the Platform Adopted at
Chicago.
CLEVELAND, Ohio. July 12.âChair
man Hanna of the Republican National
Committee authorizes the following state
ment on the platform and Presidential
nomination at Chicago:
The Domination of ex-Congressman William
Jennings Bryan of Nebraska at Chicago Fri
day afternoon was, I think, simply a climax â
a fitting oneâ to such a convention, controlled
as it wns by a combination of the most radical
and revolutionary sentiment in politics.
The effect on the country will be to bring to
the surface the honest and patriotic purposes
of all good ana true citizens who think more
of their country* houor and integrity than
party affiliations. It will make this campaign
one of seriousness, because the questions in
volved are the most important as unvoting the
interests of the country that have been before
the American people since the Presidential
campaign of 1860.
The Chicago platform means revolution and
repudiation. My judgment is tnat party lines
will be broken up to the great advantage of
the Republicau party, which will stand for all
tun iÂ» irue and American in this issue.

CANTON, Ohio. Jaly 12.â This will be a
week of more than ordinary importance at
Canton. Major McKinley expects a good
many visitors, representing various inter
ests, classess and organization. The
event which is destined to attract the
most attention, however, will be the com
ing of 600 or 800 representative women of
Cleveland on Wednesday to congratulate
Major McKinley on bis nomination and to
assure him that he has in a high degree
their confidence, respect ana admiration.
The mails of yesterday and to-day
brought Major McKinley in the aggregate
more than 100 letters from sound money
Democrats in various parts of the country.
The writers make their communications
in confidence, of course, but 96 per cent of
these letters contain direct promises of
support, coupled with vigorous observa
tions upon the action of the Chicago con
vention. A significant fact In connection
with this correspondence is that qmte one
third of these letters are from Western
Btates, where the inflation sentiment is
supposed to be overwhelming.
This evening Major McKinley received a
number of telegrams complimenting him
upon his speech of Saturday afternoon, in
.wfcich he referred pertinently to the Chi
cago piatform.
TO PRESERVE OUR CREDIT.
Major McKinley Says the Nation's
Financial Status Must Be
Protected.
CANTON, Ohio. July 12.â Several hun
dred members of the J. B. Foraker Club
of Cleveland came down on a special train
last evening to call upon Major McKinley.
In response to the remarks, of greeting
Major McKinley made his first speech

references to the action of the convention
lent interest to his utterance*. He spoke
as follows:
"My fellow-citizens: Recent events have
imposed upon the patriotic people of this
country a responsibility and a duty greater
than any since the Civil War. Then it was
a struggle to preserve the Government of
the United States. New it is a struggle to
preserve the financial honor of the United
States. Then it was a contest to save the
Union. Now it is a contest to save spot
less its credit. [Great applause.] Then
section was arrayed against section. Now
men of all sections can unite and will
unite and rebuke the repudiation of oar
obligations and the debasement of our
currency. [Applause.]
"The currency and credit of the Govern
ment are good now ami must be kept good
forever. Our trouble is not with the char
acter of the money we have, but with the
threat to debase it. We have the same
currency that we had in 1892, good the
world over and unquestioned by any peo
ple. Then, too, we had an unexampled
credit and prosperity. Our difficulty now
is to get that money in circulation and in
vested in productive enterprises, which
furnishes employment to American labor.
[Great applause.] This is impossible with
the distrust that hangs over the country
at the present time, and every effort to
make our dollars worth less than 100 cents
each only serves to increase that distrust.
"What'we want is a sound financial and
industrial policy which will give courage
and confidence to all, for when that is
done the money now unemployed because
of fear of the future and lack of confidence
in investments will appear in the chan
nels of trade. [Cries of "You are right,"
and applause]. Gentlemen, the employ*
ment of our i<ile money â the idle money
that we already haveâ in gainful pursuits
will put every idle man in the country at
work. When there is work there Is wages,
and when there is work and wages there
are consumers, who constitute the best
market for the products of our soil. [Great
applause.]
"Having destroyed business and confi
dence by a free-trade policy it is now pro
posed to make things still worse by enter
ing upon an era of depreciated currency.
Not conteni with the inauguration of the
ruinous po'icy which has brought down
the wages of the laborer and the price of
the furra products its advocates offer a
new policy which will diminish the value
of money and wages and products. [Ap
plause] Against Doth of these we stand
opposed. Our creed embraces an honest
dollar, an untarnished National credit, ad
equate revenues for the uses of the Gov
ernment, protection to labor and industry,
preservation of the home market ana reci
procity which will extend our foreign
markets. Upon this platform we stand
and submit its declarations to the sober
and considerate judgment of the Ameri
can people." [Applause.]

WILMINGTON, Del., July 12. â The
Higcins and Addicks Republicans have

ventions of the factions which will be held
next week at Georgetown and Dover re

duce the two State conventions to unite

DETAILB OF THE CATASTROPHE
Where Populous Cities Once Stood Are
Now Plains Black With
Wreckage.
TOKIO, Japan, June 26.â The horror of
Japan's calamity â the visitation of the
tidal waveâ grows as the details become
known more fully.
On the 15th of June, at 8:30 in the even
ing, a seismic wave struck the northeast
coast of the main island throughout a dis
tance of about 200 miles, and in five min
utes 30,000 people were killed and 12,000
bouses destroyed. That is the whole
story. In the case of inundations,
cyclones, or even earthquakes, there is a
record of more or less continuous mis
chief, and of more or less successful strug
gle against the forces of destruction. But
in the case of a seismic wave, one stupen
dous blow accomplishes the whole calam
ity in an instant. At 8:30 the inhabit- ;
ants of numerous towns and hamlets
along the coast were celebrating the
"Boys' Festival" on the fifth day of the
! fifth month, according to the old calen
dar; at 8:35, 30.000 of them had been
â  swept out to sea or thrown dead upon the
shore, ar.d 8000 of their homes had disap
peared or lay wrecked.
Any one can identify the locality of the
disaster by a glance at the map of Japan.
From the island of Kinkwa-san, on the
south (north latitude 38 deg. 15 mm., east j
longitude 141 deg. 30 mm.) to Hachinoye
on the north (north latitude 40 deg. 30
mm., east longitude 131 deg. 30 mm.), the
coast of Rikuzen and Rifeushu provinces
assumes a distinctly convex shape.
Throughout the whole of this bow-like
arc nearly every town and every village
was visited by the wave, the portion be
tween Motoyoshi (north latitude 38 deg. 40
mm., east longitude 141 deg. 28 mm.) and
Yamada (north latitude 39 deg. 28 mm.,
east longitude 142 mm.) suffering most
severely. The general direction of the
ffave appears to have been north by east,
! or, after carrying devastation to the shore
it the main island, it left Yezc on the west,
touching that island at Yerimo Cape only.
There was nothing to presage the disas
;er. From 11 o'clock in the forenoon un
;il 4:30 in the afternoon heavy rain fell. It
was followed by a fine evening and a dark,
:00l night. There is much difficulty in
)btaining perfectly accurate statements
is to the times of phenomena that pre
ceded the final catrastrophe ; they were
too insignificant to seem worth recording.
Several accounts agree, however, that at
7:30 o'clock three or four shocks of earth
quake were felt; not violent shocks,
though of the vertical kind that folks in
Japan have learned to dread. Tne barom
eter pave, at the time, no indication of
inything unusual. Some twenty or twenty
tive minutes later a booming sound be
came audible from the direction of the
sea. It appears to have been variously
interpreted. Some construed it as the
noise of a coming gale ; others supposed
that a huge school of sardines had reached
the ofilng, and others thought that there
was a question of whales.
Only "a very few suspected the real sig
nificance of the sound, and fled inland at
the top of their speed. Rapidly the noise
increased, until it assumed the volume
and deafening din of a great park of ar
tillery, and then, in a moment, waves
from 20 to 30 feet high were thundering
against the shore. The place < where the
actual totals oi' deaths reached the highest
figures were not always those that suffered
most in proportion to their population.
Of the three prefectures visited by the
wave â Iwate, Miyagi and Aomori â Iwate
had by far the largest aggregate of disas
ters, its list of dead mounting to 26,000,
Some of the details, however, convey a
more graphic idea of the facts than any
general statement can suggest.
Kamaisbi is a little seaside town, situ
ated at the bead of a rocky inlet two miles
deep and directly facing the Pacific Ocean.
Behind it is a precipitous hill. The inhab
itants seem to have remained until the last
wholly unconscious of what was pending.
At a little after 8 in the evening a moun
tain of sea was observed piling itself up at
the mouth of the inlet, and in a moment,
with a tremendous roar, waves 30 feet high
swept over the town. Ti.ree times these
avalanches of water rushed forward, the
first incomparably the most terrible, and
in less than two minutes the town was vir
tually annihilated. Out of 1223 dwellings
only 143 remained standing, and out of a
population of 6557 death had overtaken
4700 and 500 lay wounded. In complete
ness of destruction this record heads the
list. Scarcely less appalling was the work
of the wave in a bay some five miles far
ther north.
There, in the village of Futaishi, only
100 persons escaped death out of a popu
lation of 790, and only two houses out of
as many hundreds remained standing. At
Yamada, 700 houses out of 900 were de
stroyed, and 3000 persons were killed out
of 4200. At Toni, 250 houses were swept
away out of 1269, and 1103 persons were
killed and 82 wounded out of a total of
1206. In the Kissen district, one town and
eleven villages attacked by the wave had
6380 persons killed and 1560 houses washed
away or wrecked. At Honeo, the whole
hamlet of 150 houses was annihilated, and
the sole survivors were a party of men
OotUinued on Third Poo*.

Ratify the Se'ection of the
Nebraskan.
CHICAGO, 111., July 12.â After a two
days' secret session and conference with
prominent members the executive com
mittee of the American Bimetallic Union
adjourned to-day and formally announced
its approval of the Democratic platform
and candidates. The committee appeals
to the silver organizations of the country
Â«ho intend to send delegates to the St.
Louis convention to unite the silver forces
by indorsing the worK done in the col
iseum.
Thirty odd members of the committee
and outsiders of the union attended the
council which reached this decision. Gen
eral A. J. Warner, president of the union,
presided. There was no division of senti
ment as to indorsement. Following is the
address issued by the committee:
To the members of the American Bimetallic
Union and of all affiliated unions and leagues
throughout the United States, and all other
friends of bimetallism:
Whereas, The Bimetallic Union, being a
consolidation of the American Bimetallic
League, the National Bimetallic Union, tbe
National Silver Committee and other bimetai
lic organizations, called a conference at Wash
ington, D. C. on the 22d day of January last,
at which conference it was determined that
the people in tbe approaching election should
have the opportunity to vote for candidates
for President and Vice-I'resiiieui and ior mem
bers of Congress committed unequivocally to
the restoration of the unrestricted coinage of
both gold and silver on the terms of equality
existing prior to 1873, and to mnke
this determination sure a convention was
called by said conference to meet at St. Louis
on the 22d day of July, there to place in nomi
nation candidates for President and Vice-
President, incase meantime neither ot the two
great partiesâ as then appeared doubtfulâof
fered acceptlble candidates on a platform com
mitting the party and the candidates to the
restoration of the unrestricted coinage of both
gold and silver, and whereas, the Democratic
convention just' ended at Chicago has adopted
a platform containing all that bimetalltsts
nave demanded, fully and unequivocally ex
pressed, and has nominated candidates of dis
tinguished ability and long known as sincere
advocate' of our cause; therefore, be it
Resolved, That in the opinion of this com
mittee but one duty remHins for the friends of
this great cause to perform, and that is to
unite in support of the platform adopted at
t hicago and the candidate nominated thereon
and to work might and main until the elec
tion in November to secure tbe success of the
ticket. If this is done we sincerely oelieve
that our cause will be won and prosperity be
restored to our people.
The only danger to be feared Is in the di
vision of our own forces, which we pray will
not be allowed to take place. To divide our
forces on the eve of the great contest before
the world is unnatural aid suicidal; and for
one to lead a revolt In such a cause and at such
a time would come little short of being a pub
lic crime. We therefore appeal to all members
of the Bimetallic Union and of the affiliated
silver leagues and all others opposed to the
continuance of tlie single gold stnndard, re
gardless of party affiliations, to come to the
support of the platform and the splendid ticket
given us at the people's great convention just
held at Chicago. We further urge upon all
who agree with us upon this vital issue to join
with us at St. Louis on the 22d of July, there
to indorse and ratify the work so nobly begun.

Henry U. Miller, Second Vice-President.

George E. Bowen, Secretary.
General Warner, just before leaving to
night for his home in Marietta, said to a
reporter for the United Press:
'â¢The committee was unanimous for in
dorsement. Two-thirds of those present
were Republicans. The silver convention
in St. Louis will certainly support Bryan.
The gold men can have all the tickets they
please; the more the better, but we must
have only one silver ticket if we are to
win. No silver man of National reputa
tion will accept a nomination from any
other source. We want all the big silver
guns to come to the St. Louis convention.
The Democrats gave us all we asked for
and more than we expected a year ago. If
we had drawn the silver plank to suit the
Democrats we would probably have made
it a little more conservative. We must
have a silver daily newsi aper in Chicago
and I think there will be one here soon.
"We expect to beat McKinley in Ohio.
The people there are not for the gold
standard. 1 Jive amonjj them and know
them. A lifelong Republican in that
State wrote to me after the St. Louis con
vention and said he would not vote to sup
port such a platform, and that 100 other
Republicans in his township would follow
his example."
CRISP IS SATISFIED.
He Believes Bryan, If Elected,
Would Make an Excellent
President.
ASHEVILLE, N. C, July 12â [t is
doubtful if there is a man who is more
'Pteased with the Democratic nomination
for the Presidency, or believes more
strongly that the convention was judicious
in naming W. J. Bryan as the Democratic
standard bearer, tnan is Hon. Charles P.
Crisp of Georgia, now here.
"The nominee," he said, "is a man of2
great ability, earnestness and force of
character. During his first term in Con
gress, the fifty-second session, I appointed
him on the Ways and Means Committee,
notwithstanding it is unusual to appoint
a new member on that committee.
He had, however, been an earnest
advocate of tariff L reform and
came from the right section of the
country. It was soon proven tbat no
mistake had been made in putting him
upon that important committee, for in
that session he made a speech on the sub
ject of tariff reform whloh gave him a
National reputation."
Mr. Crisp added that Mr. Bryan was the
representative, the brilliant representa
tive, of the young Democracy, and ne was
very hopeful of his election. Mr. Crisp
felt sure that if elected his administration
would be in every way successful.
POPULISTS FOR BRYAN.
Senator William V. Allen of Ne-
braska Thinks They Will
Support Him.
OMAHA, Neb.. July 12.â Senator "Will
iam V. Allen. Populist, said in an inter
view here that he would go so far
as to say that the nomination of Mr.
Bryan was very pleasing to him, but polit
ically he was not in a position to say
whether he would give him his support.
Jn reply to a further question Senator
Allen said that he wouid not say what
action he would take until after the Popu
list party had decided what it would do.
While he did not say so in so many woros,
the impression was conveyed that he
would not be displease! if the Populists
saw fit to indorse Bryan.
In a speech in this city the Senator de
clared the Populist party could elect the
next President of the United States. The
audience interpreted it as a decoration for
Bryan, and the name of the Democratic
nominee was echoed by pit and gallery.
Whether the statement was intended to
carry that impression was not made clear,
for the speaker left the subject to attack
McKinley as the representative of tariff
taxation.
He ridiculed the battle-cry of "McKinley
and prosperity," and declared that a pro
tective tariff meant an increase of taxation
on the homes of the country. He quotf d
figures which purported to show that more
gold had gone out of the country under
Harrison's administration than under
Cleveland's, and argued from this that the
tariff had no connection with prosperity.
There was a deficit in the treasury for five
months before Cleveland came into office,
he said, and this nad been caused, in his
opinion, by the fact tbat the tariff had
been placed so high that no one was
willing to import.
The Populist convention on the 15th
will in all probability declare for Bryan.
One of the questions that was most
earnestly and most frequently discussed
about Omaha this morning was whether
Mr. Bryan wouid make his headquarters
in this city or in Lincoln. All the local
business men and the hotel men especi
ally are desirous that the headquarters
shall be here. Tne reason is too apjerent
to be pointed out. Concerning this mat
ter Mr. Hitchcock said this morning that
Mr. Bryan might make his present head
quarters at bis home in Lincoln, with his
official headquarters in this city. Anotuer
Omaha man who has been intimately as
sociated with the Democratic nominee
said he felt quite certain that Omaha
would be Bryan's principal place of busi
ness throughout the campaign. The
superior railroad facilities, be argued,
would go a long way toward deciding the
matter.
AU the railroad men are happy over the
nomination of the Nebraskan. They are
preparing to handle the large crowds tbat
are expected in Omaha daring the cam
paign to pay their respects to the nominee.
General Passenger Agent Francis of the
B. and M. said that he had already re
ceived a number of queries about special
trains to Lincoln, m the event that Mr.
Bryan should establish his headquarter
there. Tbe news that it was probable that
tbere would be no tormal visit from a com
mittee to notify the candidate of his nomi
nation was not received very enthusias
tically by the railroaders. They were ex
pectin* thousands of free silverites on that
occasion.
BRYAN IS RESTING.
Spends the Sabbath Quietly at the
Home of Mrs. Lyman
Trumbull.
CHICAGO, 111., July 12.â Exhausted
by the exactions attendant upon his nomi
nation for the Presidency, William J.
Bryan escaped last night from the im
portunate crowd of congratulatory Demo
crats and convention politicians and found
rest and privacy in the home of a family
friend. He accepted the invitation of
Mrs. Lyman Trumbull, widow of the re
cently deceased statesman, with whom he
studied law, and went to the old-fashioned
homestead oa the lake shore at No. 4008
Lake avenue, accompanied Dy Mrs. Bryan
and the children.
The nominee was so tired that it wan
afternoon when he arose. Early in tbe
afternoon Benator Jones, chairman of the
National Committee. Arthur Sewall, the
Vice-Presidential nominee, and another
Mr. Jones, who was chairman of the last
Democratic State Convention in Arkansas,
called at the spacious frame cottage to nay
their respects and politics was not dis
cussed. Mr. Bryan said he had made no
appointments with any one for tbe day or
evening and would take all the rest he
could get until tomorrow. He went
driving with Senator Jones and Mr. Sewall
in the afternoon and after dinner drove
with Mrs. Trumbull and Mrs. Bryan to
Oakwoods Cemetery, not far from the
Coliseum, to visit the grave of Mr. Trum
bull, to whom Mr. Bryan was devotedly
attached. He retired early so as to be on
hand at 9 o'clock at the Leland Hotel,
where he will meet the sub-committee of
the notification committee to agrta upon
arrangements for tbat function.
POPULISTS ARE PLEASED.
Chairman Taubeneck Says the
Democratic Nominees Make
the Roafa Easy.
ST, LOUIS. Mo., July 12.â About the
headquarters of tbe Populist party Na
tional Committee in this city there is a
spirit of exultation at the work of the
Democratic convention. Neither Chair
man Taubeneck nor his assistants will ex
plain their very apparent satisfaction at
the course of political events. When the
United Press dispatches brought to him
the fact of Sewail's nomination he pon
dered a moment and said: "This makes
onr course plain and the road easy. It
could not have been better."
The chairman yesterday sent to each
of the National Central Conimitteeruen
the following notification:

convention of the Silver parÂ»y to elect
delegates to the National Convention,
which meets in St. Louis next week, will
be held in Tcpeka on Thursday, July 16.
Many county conventions were held yes
terday to elect delegates to the State con
vention, and without exception the dele
gates were instructed to vote for only such
delegates as would favor the nomination
of Bryan and Sewall. Tbe silver men in
the county conventions have, as far as
practicable, chosen only Republicans as

independent of the People's and Demo
cratic parties as possible.

tions were also held yesterday in different
parts of tbe State, and they, too, adopted
resolutions favoring the nomination of
Bryan for President. All leading Popu

Simpson, ex-Governor Lewellyn, John W.
Breidenthal and W. A. Harris, ex-Con
gressman-at-large, are favorable to the
nomination or indorsement of the Demo
cratic candidates for President and Vice-

metals and said he believed the free coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 was the only
way out of the present industrial depres
sion.
During Chairman Coonan's remarks !
great excitement was created by Jeff
Knight, a Populist leader, who exclaimed
in a loud voice: "You have insulted the
Populist party and they never will affiil
iate with such corruption. Eleven times
your party nas downed silver. Now you
come too late." He was led out of the
crowd by a policeman and the disturbance
was quieted.

in Thirty Tents and
Churches.
RALLIES OF THE SECTS.
Evangelist B Fay Mills Creates
a Mild Sensation in His
Sermon.
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
Great Need at This Time of Chris
tian Leaders in American
Politics
WASHINGTON, D. C. July 12.â A list
of thirty meetings arranged to be held in
the tents and churches this af'ernoon
offered varying attractions to the 40,000
Christian Endeavor delegates in attend
ance here upon the fifteenth international
convention. They were mostly denomi
national rallies, and they drew crowds
according to the numerical strength of
each particular denomination. Tbe Bap
tists, Presbyterians and Consrregationalists
occupied tbe three tents on the White lot.
Speeches were made at these rallies by
prominent members of the several denomi
nation?.
Following these rallies, Evangelist B.
Fay Mills of Fort Edward, N. V., ad
dressed a large audience of citizens in Tent
Washington. He created a mild sensation
in the middle of his sermon by* a
pointed reference to Candidate Me
Kinley. Speaking of the extension of the
principles of socialism hS set forth in the
Sermon on the Mount, he showed the need
in the present time of Christian leaders in
American politics.
"Our candidates for public office fr^m
President down to constable should he
guided," said Mr. Mills, "by the spirit of
the lamb that was slain. They do pretend
to be, or they would not get onr votes.
If they came forward honestly aud maJe
known their real motives for running for
office we would not support them. Sup
pose McKinley should step before you and
say, 'Fellow-citizens, I wish to be your
President so tbat I can pay my debts'
[sensation], or suppose Bryan should say,
â¢Iâlâ l will be your President for my own
good,' why we would not choose one of
them to take care of our stray dogs. What
they say is, 'Fellow-citizens, I am reaiy
to be sacrificed upon the cross of public
duty. I am ready to be President or con
stable as my country calls me.' Tbat is
Christian. That is the spirit of the lamb
that was slain. It is a pity that it is not
always said in sincerity."
A Sabbath observance meeting was al*o
held in Central Hall, William Sb iw of
Boston presiding. Speeches were made by
Wilbur A. Crafts of Washington, Mrs.
Henry T. McEwen of New York and
others.
At the rally of the Congregational de
nomination held in one of the large tents
this afternoon Miss Margaret W, Leitch
of Ceylon delivered the following interest
ing address:
You gloTf to-day in the thought that Christ
is your captain and you are enlmed under his
banner. You glory to-day in the grent and
growing strength or your Christian Endeavor
host*, and you glory also in the faith, conte
cration and courage of your missionaries, who
are laboring to make known the love of Christ
to 'he millions in anevangelired lands.
You have at the front nearly 570 mission
aries distributed through twenty districts,
having: a popuistion of 100,000,000 people.
Your missionaries in Turkey have given an
object lesson to the whole world of seli-for
petting heroism, devotion to duty and faith ln
God.
More than eighteen months ago, after the
Sa*soun massacres, the missionaries in Turkey
fully understood that a general uprising of
Mohammedans against the Cnristians was
threatened, and that at those interior stations
far away from any consular protection their
lives would be endangered. Were they cow
ardsT Did they desert their posts? Bless God,
not one of the entire number was willing
to leave the Christian communities and the
institutions which had been established un
protected by their presence and at the mercy
of threatening mob?.
In October of last year, beginning nt Con
stantinople and sweeping over the land almost
to Persia, rolled the awful tide of massacre.
The slaughter and plunder continued for
nearly two months. The outside world, aghast
at the tales of horror that but faintly pictured
the reality, began to clamor for the abandon
ing of those interior stations. Then came the
letters from the missionaries, not written in
excitement, not the result 01 mass-meetings in
which one brave soul inspires the rest, but
penned singly, each writer expressing his or
her own brave determination to stand by the
suffering people, no matter what the personal
danger might be.
Oh, what sublime faiih and courage! God
bless those noble missionaries 1 During the
past three years, owing; to lack of funds,
serious reductions have been enforced. Thou
sands of chilai en are being turned oat of mis
sion schools. Many chapels and boarding
ichools are belog closed. Hundreds of trained
native workers are being dismissed, and some
of our noblest missionaries are breaking down
ln health because they are unable to ensure
this intolerable strain. Cannot the 500,000
member* of the Congregational churches and
the 363,000 members of the Congregational
Endeavor societies avert this disaster? The
Endeavorers here present have It easily within
their power to give or coliect the additional
sum necessary to save the foreign missionary
work from grave disaster; $100,000 will do
thi*. It yon are true in your profession of loy.
alty to Christ and the church, could you not
make this extra effort in addition t" all that
you are already doing?
To-night at 7 o'ciock Christian Endeavor
prayer meetings were held in all tbe
churches of the city. Preaching services,
both morning and evening, in the city
churches were well attended by citizens
and Endeavorers.
To-morrow is the closing day of the con
vention, Tuesday being given up entirely
to sightseeing.
SOCIALIST-LABOR ADDRESS.
Old Partis Denounced and Conditions
Declared to Be Ripe for Another
Civil War.
NEW YORK, N.Y., July J2.-The Na
tional Convention iof the Socialist party
has adopted the following resolutions:
Bfolved, That the National Executive Com
mittee be and' ls 'hereby instructed to ii>sue to
the people of the United: States au eddreÂ«a in
which a full presentation shall be made of the
present class conflicts which ; have found ex
pression in the platforms of air the political
parties now in the field, and in which special
â¢trees shall be .laid ; upon the following fact*
an<l claims: Tne unconditional surrender of
the Democratic party to the Populist demand
tor a 50-cent dollar in opposition to the pluto
cratic demand for a 200-cent doilar marks a
new era in the development of capitalism and
capitalistic politics. Two claws, equally dis
honest and heretofore united for the spolia
tion of labor, are now politically arranged
Â« gainst, each other In a struggle for the preser
vation of tueir respective fleeclngs.
Peace may not be preserved. A great crisis
may come to pass without violent outburst.
For several years the Eastern plutocracy has
been drilling its militia, while the Western
farmerocracy was burnishing its gung. With
all the armed forces at its command, the
creditor class will unquestionably assert its
privileges as goon as they will be contested,
while the debtor class, holding sway in the
country districts, and relying upon the starved
wage-workers to fight its battles in the great |
industrial centers, will forcibly attempt to re- |
sst annihilation and make good its claims.
In a word, the conditions axe now as ripe for
civil war as they were at any time previous in
the history of our country.
Between the two anarchistic classes that
capitalism, through its misu^ of science and
riches has evolved from a people once united
in comparative ignorance and poverty, stands
the gre*t American polelarian, the wage-slave
class, the landless, homeless and helpless pro
ducer of all that wealth which is now the bone
of contention between its despoilers. It aud it
alone can save tne National ship from the
coming storm of anarchy, but rally at the polls
under the banner of socialism, casting over
board the pirates, taking the helm and steer
ing straightway for the peaceful waters of a
co-operative commonwealth.
New York City waa selected as the seaj
of the next National executive committee
and Cleveland as the seat of the board of
appeals.
BATTLE WITH ROUGHS.
Conductor and Engineer Badly Beaten
by a Gang Who Refused to
Pay Their Fare.
CHICAGO, 111., July 12.â The con
ductor of a Wisconsin Central suburban
train which left the downtown station at
1 o'clock this afternoon had a savage fight
with six men near Harlem station, in
which hoth trainmen were injured. Six
men who got on just outside of Chicago
refused to pay their fare, and in their ar
gument with the conductor retreated to
the front platform of the first car, where
they made a stand.
Three of the men got off the train, but
the others clambered on the tender, and
when Conductor Cole attempted to follow
them they hit him over the head with a
coupling pin, rendering him insensible.
Engineer Wiiliam King, who came to
Cole's aid, was set upon and badly bruised
by the three toughs. Tue men were kept
on the train, however, until tne uext
station, where they were placed under
arrest. Their names are George Letters,
Frank O'Hearn and George Mason. When
Conductor Cole recovered he lound he was
minus $41 which he had in his vest pocket,
but whether he lost the money in the
scuffle or the men robbed him, he is
uuabie to say.
WAS BEATEN TO DEATH.
Mrs. Hayden Rcberts of Peru,
Nebraska, Slam by Her
Husband.
The Murdrrer Then Dispatches Him
selfâNote Show^g the Crime
Premeditated.
ATJBURN, Nebr., July 12.â County At
torney A. J. Burn ham returned to-night
from the scene of the murder of Mrs.
Hayden Robert 3 by her husband, near
Peru, which occurred this morninjr. He
c.-.ys the woman was kiikd by being beaten
over the head with the stock of a shotgun,
unf.l the same was broken, and then tho
barrel of the gun was u-ed.
Tbe murder was surely premeditated,
for a note was found near the dead
woman's body signed by Hayden Roberts
and saying that bis body would oe found
near the old salt basin in his father's
pasture, about one mile distant. The per
son finding the note did not think to look
at it until the middle of the forenoon.
Robert? had shot himself just back of tbe
right ear, aud seemiu,,iy died without a
struggle.
The tragedy is one of the most shocking
that ever occumd in Nemaha County.
Hayden Roberts was one of the oldest
resident* of the county, and a man of
some prominence. His father, an aged
veteran of the war and a man universally
respected, survives him. Henry Roberts,
a brother, was years ago a clerk in the
office of the State Superintendent of Public
Instruction at Lincoln. The murdered
woman was a widow when she married
Roberts, with children of h?r own. Their
home life was not always happy, but as to
who was to blame opinions diner.
HAWAIIAN ISLAND NEWS.
Independence Day Is Celebrated
at Honolulu on an Elabo
rate Scale.
Fifteen Thousand Japs and Chinese
Expect-d to Arrive Within
Twelve Months.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, July 6â As the
celebration of American independence and
the first anniversary of the establishment
of the republic of Hawaii feil upon July 4,
thÂ« American residents and Hawaiian
citizens united in a joint celebration on
last Saturday which far surpassed any
previous affair of the kind held here. A
marked feature of the event was the par
ticipation of many native Hawaiians and
the general friendly feeling displayed by
the natives during the day.
Considerable anxiety is beinp; felt lately
by the friends of the Government over the
question of Asiatic immigration. The late
Legislature, which haÂ«, not without cause,
been called "the planters' Legislature,"
passed a bill limiting the number of
Japanese laborers by one yes-el to 7uo men.
It is now alleged that the bill, seemingly
in favor of reduced importations of planta
tion laborers, was a put-up job. The
serious charge is made that tho planters
had all amngnments mode with the
Pacific Mail Company, so that hereafter
all its steamers from the Orient wÂ«ll touch
here, each bringing a full complement of
700 laborers. The first installment arrived
by the Doric yesterday, and it it said the
remaining steamers to touch here will
laud Io.OW Japanese laborers within the
next twelve months.
In addition to this it is learned on the
best authority ttie Government has
granted written permission to a local
agent of Chineno labor to bring in 6000
Chinese laborers during the same period.
These facia have become known to the po
litical leaders, and have already rai-ed
much adverse commÂ°nt. At won as the
facts become generally known, it is feared
the popularity the Government haa en
joyed since the establishment of the Re
public will be seriously compromised, if
not permanently impaired.
The wf-h is generally cxi ressed that the
Government will find itself strong enough
to carry out the policy of political und
commercial compromises entered upon
soon after its establishment, without
either injuring its own popularity and use
fuiness or alienating the support of the
large number of American residents who
entered the movement to secure annexa
tion on principle, with no thought of oom
promising with tbe planters in the mean
time.
That the immigration question is the
most serious of the hour does not seem as
yet to'be realized by the Government, and
I am quite certain from a recent interview
with one of the Cabinet that tbat body
does not even know that threats have
been made by the opponents of Japanese
immigration to prevent the landing of
future shipments of cooly labor, if the
scheme of the planters ia carried further.
It is announced on good authority that
tne white population of the islands will, if
forced, take concerted measures to pre
vent the proposed importation of nearly
fifteen thousand laborers during the
coming year.
The fact that 36.000 unsurcharged 18
-cent postage-stamps of the old monarchy
were put on sale at the postoffice lastweeK
waÂ« soon followed by some rumors of an
attempted stamp deal in official circles,
which had failed to mature owing to the
vigilance and prompt action of the Minis
ter of Finance. After considerable trouble
tbe following facts in the case wete
secured from semi-official and official
sources and can be relied upon to be sub
stantially correct.
Ou June 26 the Postmaster-General
called on Minister Damon and asked his
permission to sell at face value the stamps
in question. These consisted of 36,000 18
-cent stamps, which had been condemned,
being stuck together by hut weather. The
Postmaster had separated them by steam
ing so that they could be sold. After con
sultation with Judge Cooper, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, consent was given that
the stamps were to be sold for lace value
and the proceeds, $6480, turned over to
the treasury.
Aa the stamps in question are worth
$1 each some of the clerks in the post
office applied for some of them, but were
toid by those acting for the Postmaster
that the stamps were all sold to a syndi
cate, the names of whom were refused.
Rumors that another stamp deal was on
in < ih'uial circles were soon current on the
street, and, it is supposed, reached the
Minister of Finance, as the next day he
sent for the Postmaster-General and in
formed him that as the stamps were cata
logued at $1 each by stamp dealers and
were worth 50 cents each at forced sale
the public should have the advantage of
any commercial speculation in the matter.
This attitude of Minister Damon, who is
upright to an extreme in mch matters,
caused the postoffice syndicate to vanish,
and the stamps are "now being eagerly
bought up by the public and local dealers.
It is alleged that one official, who was a
member of the syndicate that failed, dis
posed of several thousand dollars' worth
of Plantation stock at a discount to carry
his share of the stamps. Had the syndi
cate succeeded in getting the stamps'they
would in a few months have made a small
fortune, as tneir profit on a forced sale, at
wholesale rates, would have been nearly
$12,000.

BERLIN, Germany, July 12.â With the
departure of the imperial family from
Potsdam, there has been a general flight
from Beriin of official, court and society
dignitaries and leaders. The Emperor
has not permitted some of the Ministers
to leave their posts as yet, and has re
quested Freiherr Marschal yon Bieber
stein, Minister of Affairs, Dr. Miquel,
Minister of Finance, and Dr. yon Boe:
-ticher, Imperial Secretary of fctate for the
Interior, to keep in touch with him by
telegraph, The minor officials, however,
are free to go wherever they please, and
the consequence is that the various de
partments of the Government bear a list
less and solitary aspect.
The group of court dames remaining as
the entourage of the Empress, together
with the Crown Prince William and his
brother, Prince Eital Frederick, who re
cently came home from Ploen, where they
have beeu at school, kept the circles of
tbe new palace lively until Thursday
when the Empress and her family left for
the schioss at Wilhelmshohe. The Kais
erine, accompanied by the Princess of
Russe, tbe Princess of Hohenzollern,
Prince Asibert and Princess yon An halt,
took boating excursions on the Havel
every day and had their Juncbeon on an
island in the river. There were also in
formal musical parties la the evening and
som 'times tue elder of the young prin
cesses would be permitted to give an early
supper party. During the day the prin
cesses were compelled to confine them
selves for a limited time to their studies.
Theot>serv;:nce of this programme lasted
until the party was broken up by the de
parture of the Empress and her children
for Wilhelmshohe, where they wiil remain
until tbe Emperor returns to Berhn from
the trip he is taking in the northern bous
and rejoins the imperial family, wLich he
wiil do early in August.
The scattering of the whole of the great
world of Beriin has seemed opportune for
authors of libelous pamphlets to try the
credulity of the public by issuing a bro
chure containing pseudo revelation? of
court scandals. Under initials which in
dicate the^names of the personages impli
cated in the scandals tbe authors of the
pamphlets rehash the old stories which
were published long ago, many of which
have since beeu repeatedly shown to be
untrue.
Yon Kotze's wife, who is staying at Ed
mansdorff as the guest of the Princess of
Saxe-Meiningen, knows nothing of the
pamphlet, and others of Yon Koize's
friends declare that the publication of the
stories were not authorized by him. The
policÃ are prohibiting the sale of the
pamphlet.

noff-Rostovsky will devote his leave of
absence absolutely to the repose winch is
necessary to xhe restoration of his health.
There is rfo doubt that Europe has
reached a period of armistice in the diplo
matic warfare over Turkey, but the Gov
ernments are relying too much upon the
slowing up of matters in Cr te, and the
unlikelihood of a recurrence of important
events in that island is the official impres
sion here. Dr. Nicholaides. the official
representative of the Cretan Reiorm Com
mittee, wno is now in Berlin, distrusts the
present comparative calm and regards it
merely as a brief truce before the break
ing out of the storm. The only c:.ance of
permanent peace in Crete, he declare*. 11
in the intervention of" the powers and the
granting of autonomy to the island.
Apart from ihe opinion expressed by Dr.
Nic .olaides advices have been received
here from Cauea to the effect that althoneh
the Christian deputies will attend the
opening session of the Cretan Assembly
to-morrow, they do not intend to engage
in debate with the Moslem deputies, but
will present to Berovitch Georgi Pasha,
the newly appointed Christian Governor
of Crete, who will preside, a document
setting forth the claims of the Christian
Cretans, to which will De added a demand
for universal suffrage and the recognition
of a Cretan flag with the cross thereon.
They will give the Porte a short time in
which to respond to these demands, and
if the Porte's reply shall be unfavorable,
as it certainly will be, the Christian denu
ties will constitute an independent assem
bly. In the meantime the insurgent-w ill
seize the advantage afforded by the Turk
ish troops being forced into inactivity and
occupy ail of the strategic points in the
island. J , Â
The fus* which has been made by the
French and Belgian newspapers over the
formation of a German military camp at
Elsenborn, on the German frontier, has no
substantial basis.
Two years ago, as was cabled at the time,
the Government purchased larL'e tracts of
ground at Malmeder and Eisenborn, which,
it was understood, were to be devoted to
making experiments in field operations
and shooting practice with various kinds
ot guns. Since that time the bouses upon
the land purchased have beer, torn down
and replaced by extensive barracks, and
roads and trenches have been constructed,
but no fort works nave been erected. There
is ample room for the camping of 4000
men. There is no doubt that the position
woul dbe of great strategic value if Ger
many designed to strike at France through
Belgium, but there is not the slightest
siirn of any intention on the part of Ger
many to create a stronghold there, and the
imliirnant protests ot the French and
Belgium press have been wasted.

THE FUNERAL TRAINS.
Vast Crowds Surge Forward to
Meet Them and Learn the
Worst.
SOBS AND GROANS COMMINGLED
Headless Trunks and Limbless Bodies
on Eoards of Pineâ The Killed
and Injured.
OMAHA. Nebr., July 12.â This has
been a day of general mourning in
Omaha. The harvest of death from the
Logan (Iowa) wreck of last night bas been
increased, and the list of victims now
numbers thirty-one.
The crowds of anxious people at the
depots did not scatter with the break of
day, although the excitement of the night
wore off as relatives and friends of the
dead ones became convinced of the worst.
About 7 o'clock the first funeral train from
the scene of the catastrophe arrived at
the Union depot, and there was an invol
untary puÂ«h forward to gratify a morbid
desire to learn the news Irom those who
had been *v the disaster.
The first train contained many of the
more seriously injured, and as the poor
unfortunates were lifted in blankets from
the car the groans of tbe wounded
mingled with the agonized sobs of rela
tives and friends. It was a most touch
ing scene. Some twenty passengers were
taken in ambulances to St. Joseph's Hos
pital. Several of them cannot hope to
live more than a tew hours at the
furthest.
At 8:30 o'clock the train carrying the
dead was sighud coming across the lornr
Union Pacitic trestle. Nearer tne specter
drew and an involuntary wail of mourn
ing burst from the assembled multitude.
The contrast of the day before was sharply
drawn. A crowd of happy young people
had gathered on the same depot platform.
Good-bys were said amia the waving of
flags and playing of bands as the cars
moved out. No one dreamed of the terri
ble fate that was in store for tne merry
excursionists.
The approaching train consisted of two
carsâ a baggage car (a chamber of horrors)
and a passenger coach. As it drew up to
the station a special cordon of police
guarded the approaches and kept the
crowd back. Seventeen bodies laid on
pine boards and covered with a plain mus
lin shroud were taken out one by one and
placed along the floor of the baggage
room. Only friends of the missing ones
were allowed admission. Those silent
forms gave evidence of the force of yester
day's collision. Headless trunks, bodies
without limbs, limbs without bodiesâ a
grewsome spectacle â were gathered in that
small space.
Occasionally some one would recognize
the features of a son or daughter. Kind
friends would eently lead them from the
room and the body would be ticketed and
sent to the undertakers. Women fainted,
and anguish was ofttimes pictured on the
lace of some gray-haired old man.
A complete list of the dead and injured

It is ceiierally conceded among railroad
men as well as others conversant with the
facts that the blams for the accident Jay
with the conductorand engineer of the ex
cursion train. Engineer Montgomery re
fused to talk and to-day went to Boone,
where he live*. The story is current, how
ever, that Conductor Reed of the excur
sion train gave the signal to go ahead
without waiting for orders from the oper
ator at Logan. The excursion train was to
have waited for No. 2, the fast mail, and
No. 38, the fast freight, to pass before leav
ing for Council Bluffs. When the limited
mail had passed he forgot about the
freight, which is a regular train, so the
story goes, and gave the signal to pull
out.
The fast freight was due at Logan at
fi :48 o'clock and the excursion started at
6:40. After leaving the switch it stopped
and the switch was reset, and the excur
sion train was just getting well under way
when the collision occurred.
Members of the picnic party state that
the train was not going faster than four
or live miles an hour. When Encineer
Montgomery saw the other train he set
the air brakes on all the coaches in his
train and the brakes were set when the
collision occurred. Railroad men on the
train say the fast freight was going about
fifty miles per hour. The engine of the
fast freight was forced through and over
the engine of the excursion train and
liffd itself almost clear of the rails.
Ihe baggage-car was forced back
through the hm coach, the left-hand side
of the baggage-car passing outside of the
left side of the passenger coach and the
right side cutting through the passenger
coach in line with the right row of seats.
It was on this side that most of the fatali
ties occurred.
According to the rules of operating
trains Engineer Montgomery must, from
statements of railroad men, share in the
blame. The rules require engineers to
wait for telegraphic orders before starting.
They are not allowed to assume that the
conductor has received orders, but must
insist on getting orders which are sup
posed to be a duplicate of those given the
conductor. If -Montgomery assumed that
the conductor had received the orders to
leave and pulled his train out on the sig
nal under this assumption, that fact does
not excuse him.
Montgomery is almost crazed with grief,
and the rumor was curnut yesterday that
he had tried to commit suicide, but had
r>een prevented. An effort to verify this
report was made, but it was denied by his
friends.
ANOTHER DISASTER.
Five Excuraioniata Killed and Twenty
Injured JSear Chicago.
CHICAGO, July 12.â An excursion train
on the Wisconsin Central ran into an open
switch at Altenheim, a suburb ten miles
west of this city, this evening, killing five
people and injuring about twenty. The
names of the dead are:
Charles Samuels, Chicago.
Frederick Keitel, Chicago.
Fred Kerry, Chicago.
Miss Mary Arnold of Chicago.
Miss Hobart of Chicago.
Injured â Mrs. Fagin, Chicago, right leg
broken.
EJward Kelly, Chicago, left leg broken.
D. B. Alden, left arm broken.
J. H. Heater, conductor of the train,
badly bruised.
Peter Conner, injured internally.
Fred Gravell, badly bruised and internal
injuries.
Teu or fifteen others were injured, but
were taken away in carriages, patrol wa
gons and other conveyances before their
names could be learned.
The train consisted of thirteen coaches
and was returning from Schiller Park,
where the Graded Assessment Club, a
lodge of the Ancient Order of United
Workmen, had given a picnic. The train
was coming down a grade, approaching
Altenheim station, and tbe speed was so
great that tbe engineer could not stop in
time to avert the wreck.
Standing on the sidetrack were a switch
engine and a passenger train waiting for
the excursion train to pass. When the
picnic train struck the engine and train
the baggage-car was telescoped by the
next coach. Those who met death were
riding in the baggage-car, as no seats were
to be had in the coaches.
It is not known who is guilty of leaving
the switch open, but pending an investiga
tion the police arrested Conductor Heater,
Jam-s Grant and William Doian, the
crew of the excursion train, and the crew
of the sidetracked passenger train.
Operator Knisner, who works the
switches from a tower, admitted to-night
that he had placed the switch in the right
position, but neplected to* lock it, and it
had reopened. He was arrested.

that happened to be playing "go ' in a
temple situated on high ground. Sncti
are the tales of death and ruin that come
from place alter place, the terrible totals
at this writing being 29,073 killed, 7737
wounded and 7844 houses washed away cr
wrecked.
In the Prefecture of Iwate, where 36
towns and villages on the coast were vis
ited by the wave, 25,413 persons were
killed and 6779 wounded out of a total pop
ulation of 104.771, so that out of every
three inhabitants one was killed or
wounded. It is difficult yet to Bay
whether males or females preponderate
among the victims. Statistics from Mi
yaei Prefecture show that out of 1376
deaths in 20 villages 876 were males and
500 females. On the other hand, a traveler
passing through the two hamlets of Tan
no-uru and Funa-kosbi, the day after the
catastrophe, saw only 30 young men there.
Not a living woman or a child was visible.
On the road, however, within a distance of
some 200 yards, he counted corpses of
women and children to the namber of 33.
Tnere were some remarkable escapes.
Men swept out to sea from one side of a
bay were thrown up alive on the opposite
beach; and in one case several persons
were deposited on an island nearly three
miles from the town whence the wave had
torn tiieni. A few saved their lives by
dinging to baulks of timber, and several
getting wedged among the wooden debris
of wrecked buildings, were preserved un
til the ware receded. At an inn in O-uraa
truveier, apparently tbe only man in the
house, was grasped by four terrified women,
and the combined weight of the five fur
nished a steady point But such oright in
cidents were rare, whereas of inexnressi
blv sad happenings there are numbers.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 13, 1896.
The parents of six children caused the lit
tle ones to throw their arms around abeam
of the house. There they clung, the water
reaching up to their shoulders. The small
est child losing its hoid, was swept away,
and its mother, springing after it, shared
its fate.
Presently the father, trying to fend off
some floating debris that threatened to
strike the children, was carried off, and
the five orphans alone remained. In an
other family of ten one child of 8 drifted
to a rock and was saved; and in another
family of the same number the father,
having carried a baby to a hill and found
that none of the others followed, set down
the baby and ran back, only to perish with
the rest. The story of a retired soldier is
worth repeating. His experiences in the
recent war had taught him to apprehend
the raiding of Japan's coasts by a hostile
fleet. Thus, when the cannon-like roar of
the advancing waters and the cries of the
people reached him, he threw on his tunic
and ran shoreward, sword in hand.
Next morning his corpse was found,
much battered, but not separated from the
sword. Strange to say, fishermen plying
their trade four miles from the coast did
not observe anything to indicate the occur
rence of a serious phenomenon, though a
party only three miles out, in the same
district, encountered heavy breakers roll
ing from the north. By and by one of the
boats observed what seemed to be a large
fish floating on the water, but on rowing
nearer they saw that it was a child iying
on a mat. In the same manner three other
children were picked up by a fisherman,
who, to his astonishment, found that one
of them was his own son. Inexpressibly
sad was the case of some fishermen who,
returning shoreward in the early morning
after the catastrophe, received their first
notice of what had occurred by finding the
corpses of their wives and children float
ing in the water.
At points closer to the center of the dis
turbance, however, the commotion in the
water was perceptible at a much greater
distance from shore. Thus, a party of
fishermen who were out looking for tunny
off the Shizukawa coast, between 7 and 8
p. m., heard, as they supposed, the boom
ing of big guns in the distance. Soon
afterward, looking seaward, they saw the
surface of the ocean heave in huge masses,
which, after rising to mountainous
heights, broke in the middle and. swept
northward and southward, ultimately
striking the shore with a deafening crash.
Tne waves passed under the boats without
swamping them, but the water in the
vicinity of the shore remained so rough
throughout the night that the fishermen
could not make land until morning, when
they found their wives and children dead
and their homes in ruins.
The scene presented by the devastated
I districts is shocking. Along the beach the
timbers of wrecked houses lie piled upon
leach other; moss-covered roofs of thatch
I that sheltered happy families a few days
ago in quiet country nooks are strewn
pell-mell on the sands. Here, houses that
nave had their walls torn away stand,
mere skeletons; there, others have been
wrenched from their foundations, tele
scoped into each other, tumbled upside
down or heaped together in shattered con-
I fusion. In one instance the immense
mass of water, rushing up a narrow inlet,
tore from their foundations the houses on
cither side and drove them with terrific
force into the highland ahead, where they
now lie crushed into a confused mass of
I timber, thatch and wreckage of all kinds,
tiie grave of many a mangled body.
Horses and cattle lie wedged among the
rocks, and men and women wander about,
| stupefied and helpless, looking as though
! their minds and energies had been
numbed. Numerous corpses are still bur
ied under the debris of ruined buildings,
or under heaps of mud and sand thrown
I up by the waves, and often when a body
'is disinterred, no friend or relative re
| mains alive to identify it. The Govern
i ment is. of course, adopting vigorous
measures of relief and liberal subscrip
tions are pouring into the newspaper
offices, both vernacular and foreign, for
when calamity overtakes Japanese, the
benevolence of the foreign community is
invariaDly large-handed.
As to the cause of the disaster, opinions
are still divided. At hrst it was -supposed
that the disturbance bad its origin in a
sudden collapse of tbe sides of the subter
ranean crater known as the Tuscarora
deep. Commander Rear Admiral)
Belknap of the Lnited States navy,
on a deep-sea-survey cruise in tlie United
States frigate Tuscarora. twenty-two years
ago, found a trough-like depression off
the northeast coast of Japan, in
north latitude 44 deg. 50 rnin.
and east longitude 152 deg. 30 miv. The
heavy sounding lead took about one and
a half hours to reach bottom and indicated
a depth of 4655 fathoms, or over ;>}., -ta!
utc miles. But it being tolerably evident
that the center of the recent disturbance
lay between the 39th and 40th parallels of
latitude and thel42d and 143 d meridians of
longitude, the Tuscarora Deep seems to be
excluded from the problem.
On the other hand, considering that the
advent of the great wave was immediately
preceded Dy earthquake shocks whose
vertical character precludes the hypothe
sis that they were due to the studendous
rolling of the wave itself, the most reason
able conclusion appears to be that a sub
marine volcanic eruption took place some
where within the area of ocean bounded
by the 142 d and 143 d meridians of east
longitude and the 39th and 40th parallels
of north latitude. The Baudai-san phe
nomenon of 1886 illustrates very vividly
tbe kind of disturbance that may at any
moment occur among the ranges of vol
canic mountains on the ocean's bed. At
Bandai-san millions of tons of earth and
rocks were hurled in a given direction
with force that carried an enormous wave
of solid material over a distance of many
miles at railway speed.
Anything of that kind happening at the
bottom of the sea would evidently pro
duce surface effects precisely such as those
experienced on the 15th of June. That
the water had been thrown up from great
depths to swell the bulk of the colossal bil
low is proved by the fact that deep-sea
shell-fish were found in the hills visited by
the wave. Moreover, at one place, lying
beyond the destructive range of the wave,
the fishermen next morning found their
seines floating on the surface upside down.
Tuey bad evidently been cast up by some
submarine commotion. It may be" added
i here that since the catastrophe the fish
seem to have deserted the upper waters.
A few can be caught now only by using
tho deepest seines, the great bulk havini*
apparently goue down to inaccessible
depths.
In every previous instance, however, the
marine disturbance is spoken of as the
corollary of h severe earthquake, whereas,
although 150 seismic vibrations were felt
in the northeast between the evening of
June 15 and noon on the following day
âtwenty-four of them making tbemselve's
. sensible in Tokio â not one was sufficiently
severe to cause any alarm.
A shocking feature of these phenomena
is their savage energy of destruction In
the valleys, below Bandai-san men's bodies
when not torn limb from limb, were bat
tered out of all human shape. No wonder
that such was the case, for so stupendous
was the atmospheric disturbance that it
not only leveled forests to the ground but
also stripped the trees of bark and twitrs
reducing them to blanched skeletons. '
And now, in the case of the Iwate wave
corpses recovered within a few hours of
death looked as though they had under
gone a week s decomposition. The wounds
suffered by tbe survivors and shown by the
| bodies of the dead are also of a shocking
description. In borne cases tbe flesh is
torn into shreds, exposing the bones be
neath ; in others the eyes are forced out of
their sockets; in others the trunks seem to
have been wrenched asunder by forces act
ing in opposite directions; in others the
skin looks as though it had been plunged
| in boiling water, and almost every corpse
shows purple spots as if it had been
fiercely pelted with fragments of stone or
iron. Ii is expected that over 30 per cent
of tbe survivors now receiving medical
treatment will succumb. Then the tale of
deaths will considerably exceed 30,000.

Lot Angeles Fiesta Incorporated,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 12.-The
committee of thirty has decided to incor
porate the annual celebration hÂ«re under
the name of La Fiesta de Los Angelea.
ALVARADO'S NEW
CAMPAIGN CLUB,
Fifty Republicans Form a
McKinley Bicycle
Corps.
MUSIC ON THE WHEEL.
Spokes of Their Silent Steeds
Adjusted to the Tune of
"America."
THEIR EMBLEM A SUGAR BEET.
Electric Lamps Flash Out the Red,
White and B ue as They
Ridj On.
ALVARADO, Cal., July 12.â Alvarado,
the "cradle of the American beet-sugar
industry." has organized a McKinley Bi
cycle Corps with fifty members. Many
striking and novel features have been
embodied in the uniforms and other para
phernalia, and when all the details have
been perfected no political gathering in
this good old Republican county will be
deemed a success without the Alvarado
Corps. Special pains are being taken to
train each member carefully in the ma
neuvering of his wheel, and when the en
tire body of wheelmen displays its in
tricate evolutions at the first public ap
pearance it will be a dazzling sight.
At the intersection of each spoke with
the rim is placed a small incandescent
electric lamp, the colors alternating red,
white and blue. A suitable device is
placed on one side of the hub to succes
sively light the different colored lamps as
the wheels revolve. Electricity is supplied
by a storage battery carried on the top
cross-bar, just back of the steering head.
The spokes are not all screwed to a uni
form tension (as is customary with best
bicycie manufacturers), but are adjusted
to give forth various musical notes as the
wheel revolves and the spokes come in
contact with a metallic finger. The vari
ous wheels have been tuned by a member
of the Alvarado Choral Society, who
should here be given credit for the origi
nality of the idea and the painstaking
way in which it has been carried out
Tbe first intention was to have the
wheels tuned to play souie stirring cam
paign song, but this was found imprac
ticable, owing to the many lady riders
who would be unable to ride so fast; so a
compromise has been arranged and
"America" is played. Several practice j
runs have been made on the unfrequented
roads beyond the pumping station, and it
is an inspiration to see fifty gaylv deco
rated wheels rushing down the road and
pouring forth our melodious National air. !
Other tunes may be piaved later, as the j
addition here iv-.d thereof a falsa spoke
may give the desired effect.
The uniiorm consists of black stockings,
white coat and knickerbockers trimmed
with black, and a uniform cap quite in
keeping with the general aspect of the
wheel, and with tbe great and promising
industry which bas made Alvarado better
known in Germany and France than in
America â the beet-sugar factory. This cap
resembles an inverted sugar beet, the root
forming the spike of the cap and the green
leaves drooping over the head. The beet
root is made of fine white porcelain and
has a small electric lamp concealed in the
center, directly opposite a transparent por
trait of McKinley. Below this portrait is
a small sign, "16 to I"â i. c., sixteen
pounds of sugar for one dollar.
The club's first public appearance will be
made in about two weeks (if the condition
of the roads permit), when they will run
over to Mount Eden to participate in tbe
dedication ceremonies of the McKinley
wigwam now being erected in tii; t village.
LOS ANGELES REFORM CLUB.
Purity in Po litics It* Platform for the
Campaign.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 12, -The
Fourth ward of this city is destined to
distinguish itself in a peculiar way politi
cally. A unique club was formed in this
ward last evenine. Though espousing
politics it is not allied to any party. It is
called the Fourth Ward Reform Club, and
already has a signed membership of 198
voters, all piedged to support no candidate
not indorsed by the club.
The meeting last evening was opened by
Rev. Francis M. Larkin, who delivered an
address describing and explaining the ob
j ectÃ and intention of the club. President
ParEer read, for the benefit, of non-mem
bers present, the original pledges of the
club, which every member has already
signed :
We, the undersigned residents, taxpayers
and voters of the fourth Ward in the city of
Los Angeles, Stale of California, nereby sign
our names and pledge our support to this club
and the principles on which It is organized.
Our object is not to antagonize any particu
lar party organization or individual, nor is it
to further the particular interest of anyone.
We are of the people and for the people; there
fore, believing that only,. in union is there
strength, and realizing that our officials are
not always the choice of the people, but of the
few political leaders, we pledge ourselves to
give neither promise nor support to any can
didate not indorsed by our club.
J. A. Williams was elected vice-presi
dent, J. C. Godwin permanent secretary
and A. H. Liscomb treasurer. The meet
ine was lamely attended and enthusiastic,
each member pledging himself to take
keen interest in the coming elections.
LOS ANGELES NEW DAILY
Free Silver Democrat* to Have a Morning
Metrapaper.
.LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 12. â For
weeks past there has been talk of estab
lishing a free silver morninp daily news
paper in Los Angeles. The nomination
of Bryan bas revived this talk, and it now
seems probable that the new paper will
appear in the near future. At least two
at>le newspaper men have been spoken to
in connection with the enterprise. It is
said that ampie capital will oack the en
terprise and that the full night report of
the United Press will be lateen. The office
will be in the quarters lately vacated by
the Evening Record.
A prominent official of the American
Protective Association will see that the
new venture receives recognition in that
organization. It is said that the gold pro
clivities of the Herald, the Democratic
organ, will prevent it from strongly sup
porting the Presidential nominee, hence
the supposed necessity for an out-and-out
free silver daily.
ESPOUSES BRIAN'S CAUSE.
Judge JTinaor Departs for St. Louis to
Work for thr Sebraakan.
SEATTLE, Waph., July 12.â Judge
Kichard Winsor, delegate to the National
! Populist Convention from this State, left
i to-night for St. Louis. He will, by reason
J of his standing and ability, probably head
I the Washington delegation, composed of
I seventeen members, and a majority of
whom expect to gather at Spokane and
depart for St. Louis on the morning of
July 16. JudÂ«e Winsor goes at this time
in order to be upon the ground early to
lend assistance to the movement to have
Bryan, the Democratic standard-bearer,
either indorsed or nominated outright
by the St. Louis convention.
"I'm going to do what I can to have
j Bry*n nominated, provided he is will'ne
i to stand upon our platform, and of that I
have no doubt. Since his nominati n I
have put in my time trying to ascertain
the sentiment of the Populists of this
State, and aimost to a man they favor the
selection of Bryan on the conditions I
have indicated. As to Sewall, I hardly
know what to -ay. It may be that the
plan is to have him withdraw and a Popu
list named in his stead."
JACKSON'S YOUNG FIREBUG.
The Son of a Miner Confesses That He
Started Several Recent Con
flagrations.
JACKSON, Cal., July 12.â For over a
week the new fire alarm system has given
daily warnings, and the citizens of Jack
son have not only been alarmed them
selves but the whole district of the mother
lode. The first fire started on the Fourth I
of July in a house adjoining the school
house, and since then the alarm has been
sounded each day. Yesterday some barns
and other buildings were burned, with a
loss of $2000 or $3000. To-day there was a
fire near the courthouse, the barn of
Marelia & Parker being destroyed. Ad
joining it were the law offices of ex-Con
gressman A. Caminetti, Judge John F.
Davis and Silas Penry, and their valuable
libraries were damaged considerably,
though many of the books were saved.
The total damage was about $18,000.
After the fire yesterday a peddler was
arrested on a charge of arson, but he was
released to-night, when the actual firebug
was discovered. He is George Savich, a
Slavonian employed in the Zeila mine.
The boy is about 13 years of age. Savich,
after his arrest, acknowledged his crime
and stated that he had started the lire.,
because the owners of the buildings had
accused him of acts of theft. The total
loss by yesterday's fire was $15,000.
OAKDALE FIELDS RAVAGED
Flames Sweep Over Grain Lands
in the Valley of the San
Joaquin.
Acres of Wheat and Barley De
vastated and Several Buildings
Destroyed.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 12.â One of the
largest grain fires ir years started last
night at 6 o'clock a few miles east of Oak
dale on the Threlfall ranch. How the fire
originated no one seems to know, but it
destroyed between $7500 and $10,000 worth
of grain and buildings.
The greatest loss was sustained by j
Rancher Ericksen, a renter from Has
lacher & Kahn, the Oakdale bankers. He I
lost 500 acres of fine wheat, together with
a house, barn and blacksmith shop. Tbe
property was partly insured. Harry Owen,
another farmer, lost 350. acres of choice
wheat ready for cutting, anl sixty acres of '
wheat on tbe Threlfbll ranch where the j
fire started was completely destroyed.
John Conner was another heavy loser,
his 100 acres of fine barley being burned.
The Oakdale Land and Improvement
Company lost 100 cords of wocd.
The fire will completely wreck a number
of those who sustained losses, as some
carried no insurance. Every effort to stop
the progress of tbe flames was unavailing.
A wind was blowing at the time, and as the
grain was dry the fire spread rapidly and
carried everything before it.
FIRE AT SAN RAFAEL
Flames Destroy a Half- Dozen Buildings in
the Business Section of the
Town.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., July 12.â A fire
broke out. at 3 o'clock this morning in the
Miller block on Fourth street. Two build
ings, owned by William Dale, which con
tained his furniture store and Ramos' res
taurant, wÂ«re destroyed, together with
Costa's grocery snd the express office of
Wells, Fargo & Co. T. C. King's building,
which was occupied by Malone's phar
macy, is left standing, although the in
terior is a wreck. On A street a new two
story building, owned by James Tunstead
and occupied by George McMillan's pho
tograph gallery and Hotchkiss' cyclery, is
a total loss.
The McMillan and Hotchkiss families,
who resided in the building, were not
aware of their peril until window-panes
began to crack around them. They had
only time to get out without saving even
their clothing.
McMillan's insurance is $750; Hotch
kiss' loss is $4500, insurance $1000; Ramos'
loss is $1500, no insurance; William Sail
has an insurance of $5000 on his building
and $2500 on his stock; Malone's loss >a
$2500, insurance $1500.
Fire at Los OH rot.
LOS OLIVOS, Cal., July 12.â Fire that
presumably started from hot ashes from a
locomotive destroyed the engine-house
and a locomotive of tbe Pacific Coast Rail
way at this place, spread to adjacent stub
ble-fields and consumed a small dwelling
on the hill above. Only by the heroic ef
forts of the people was the beautiful
$10,000 schoolhouse saved. Many acres of
grain stubble were destroyed. "The total
los 9 is about $5000.
San Rafael Mnurnt.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., July 12.â Captain
D. F. Bradford, an old resident of this
place, died at his summer home in Bolinas
yesterday. His death was the result of an
accident which occurred early last week.
While fishing on Bolinas Bay his boat was
run into by a schooner and upset. The
captain was well alone in years, and from
the first it was feared he could not recover.
He leaves a widow and one son, William
B. Bradford.
Sftti Jose Ineenttiariam.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. July 12.â A fire that
was probably of incendiary origin oc
cunvd to-night at the residence of Mrs. E.
Hughes at 351 South Fourth street.
While the family was sitting on the front
porch the fire broke out in two closets in
different parts of the house. The blaze
was discovered Â»n time to prevent it from
getting under headway. The loss, amount
ing to about $300, was covered by insur
ance.
Inrrndinrism at (inlreaton.
GALVESTON, Tex., July 12.â There was
another disastrous fire on the wharf here
to-day and property valued at $150,000 was
destroyed. The tire was of incendiary
origin. Owing to this discovery it is be
lieved the $200,000 wharf tire of ten days
ago was also of incendiary origin. The
property destroyed today was a shed
owned by the Morgan Steamship Com
pany, wliich contained 2,000,000 yards of
jute bagging.
Catholic Church I'ntroyed by fire.
BROOKLYN, N. V., July 12â The Ro

CUNNING OF THE MURDEREB.
Donned a Suit of Overalls Before He
Began the Work of
Death.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July 12.â i
i.n important discovery has been made in (
connection with the Richardson mnr- j
lers. Officer Peter Storni, one of the I
keenest men ever connected with the
ocal detective force, has been for days
luietly beating the neighborhood in the
ricinity of the Richardson place in the j
lope that some evidence might be found
vhich would help to determine the iden
;ity of the murderer. At noon to-day, j
while searching in a field directly oppo- !
iite and below the Richardson place, he j
:ound in a ditch near a line of gum trees
i bloody shirt, a pair of overalls and a
pair of shoes, which are now in possession
>f the Coroner.
The overalls are a pair of common bine |
ienines, somewhat worn, but neither |
'rayed nor ragged, so that there is no ap-
Darent reason for their having been dis
carded. They would fit a small man of j
ibout the height of Barnard, the sus
pect killed while resisting arrest. The
shirt is of blue calico, with a white lily of
the valley figure, worn, but not frayed at |
the wrists and collar. Upon the right cuff I
â nd the front of the garment are stains j
and clots of blood. The garment is slit
lengthwise, front and back. This may
have been done in hastily tearing it off or
by a cow, which had been placidly chew
ing the left sleeve of the unsavory morsel, j
perhaps Attracted by the blood.
The shoes are large, but bore evidence of 'â 
having been lately worn by a man with a I
small foot, the leather being shrunk in a I
manner to cau&e this impression. The ;
shirt seems to have a No. 14 collar and the ;
sleeves are short. Nothing was found in !
the pockets of the overalls, and no foot
steps could be traced from the place.
The garments will at once be handed j
over for microscopical examination, to de- i
termine whether the blood is human. No
one who sees them, knowing that they
were found but a stone's throw from the
house of the tragedy, doubts that tbe
blood came from the murdered Richard
son women. The apparent age of the !
blood clots is the same as those now dry
ing in the, lonely house above. It was
demonstrated beyond a doubt that who
ever murdered these helpless victims must
have been spattered with their blood. The
shirt is of a peculiar pattern and of a style j
and make bandied by a local clothier. It
is believed that it will be easily identified. !
Mrs. Peterson, Cyrus Barnard's step- '
mother, upon being questioned relative to !
his possession of a snirt of the color and
pattern described, vigorously denied that
he owned such a garment and declared
that having done all the young man's
washing she was in a position to speak
positively. On the overalls are some i
white spots, as though made by paint.
This is regarded as further evidence that
they belonged to Barnard, as he often
worked as a house painter.

RINCON EAGLE DANCE.
Weird Orgies Indulged In by Indian
Braves on the Southern
Reservation.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 12.â The In
dians on the Rincon Reservation have just
concluded one of their annual "eagle
dances." This custom is one dating back
to their barbaric stage, but it is still kept
up with zealous ardor and regularity.
In the high, rocky cliffs on the upper
San Luis Rey eagles build their nests and
the growth of the yoking birds is carefully
noted. When the birds are nearly ready
to fly a man is let down by means of a
rope suspended from the top of the cliff to
the cave where the nest is and the young
eagles are captured. Then the signal is
Bjven that an eagle has been caugi t and
many Indians gather, dance and rejoice
over its capture. A night is then set (gen
erally three weeks from capture) for the
eagle dance.
At the appointed time the Indians,
young and old, from all over the reserva
tion gather at the usual dancing place,
where huge piles of brush have been piled
up and campfires lighted. The eagle is
tied and weighted down with calico. The
dance begins and is kept up incessantly
throughout the night, accompanied by
the Indians' weird music, shrieks anil
whoops. In the course of the performance
messages are sent to departed relatives
and friends, to be delivered by the eagle to
those who nave gone to the Indian heaven.
Raiment and iood are also sent as tokens
of remembrance and good cheer.
No ready-made clothing is ever sent.
Presumably the Indian believes that
clothes made here mieht not be "correct"
in style in the land over there, or that the
angel Indian has plenty of time to make
his own clothes or plenty of eo!d to em
ploy a tailor. New calico seems to be the
favorite goods to send.
At the break of day the brush pile is set
on fire, and eagle, calico and all are con
signed to t.he flames, the breeze fanning:
smoke, ashes and fumes heavenward; the
dance ceases, the gathering disperses, and
the Indians return to their homes rejoic
ing.
DROWNED AT BLACK DAIMOND
J~atnev Fitzgerald's Jienolre Against
Sutcidn Idnd-s too Ijtttt.
STOCKTON, Cal., July ,12. â As the
steamer Mary Garrett, bound for Stockton
from San Francisco, was at the wharf at
Black Diamond last night James Fitz
gerald, who was slightly under the influ
ence of liquor, stepped upon a stringer on
the outer edge or the wharf. He looked
for a few moments into the water, as
though deciding whether to make the
plunge or not, and attempted to step back.
In doing so he lost his balance and fell
headlong into the water near the side of
the steamer.
As Fitzgerald came up for the first time
a friend, who saw him fall in, called out,
"Can you swim , Jim?" to which the man
in the water shouted, 'â¢No.' Then the
friend leaped into the river to rescue Fitz
gerald, but he was too late, as the current
had carried the drowning man down
stream and beneath tne surface. Life re

GRANT COUNTY WARFARK
Strife Hettceen â  Sheepmen Likely to End
â  â ' ': 'â  -in Bloodshed. LÂ£-Â»'i*; '
.PORTLAND, Ob.. July 12.â News comes
from Grant County that the sheep war, as
it is called, is becoming serious, and if the
sheepmen overstep the quarantine limits
there will be bloodshed. Early this spring
the people' of Fox Valley decided that
sheep could not longer be promiscuously
herded in their valley and notified all to
that effect. As a result of their deter
mination two bands were fired upon and
rainy sheep killed and wounded.
Last week a band of sheep belonging to
Scharff Brothers was shot into, eight
being killed and about a dozen wounded.
The next night a similar attack was. made
on a band belonging to John Nealan.
This tin\e about fifteen sheep were killed
and about sixty wounded. The herder,
one of George Creighton's boys, was in
bed asleep when the shooting occurred.
A ball struck and killed his dog by the
bedside. The probability is that in a few
days not only "sheep's blood, but human
blood may be shed.

the Youth Who Tcok his
I/fe.
MERCED, Cat,., July 12.â Elmer Bolles ;
was shot and killed by Rix Shafer this j
morning r.t 8 o'clock. The trag- j
edy followed a quarrel between the ;
two men. The trouble bean last night,'
when, after a war of words, they came to j
blows. Bolles was the larger and stronger
man and Shafer ran from him and started
for his home. This morning they met on j
Front street, Bolles Lad been drinking, :
and from the story of witnesses he ap
peared to be the aggressor and insisted t
upon taking up the quarrel of the previous
evening. Shafor told Bolles to attend to
bis own business, an warned Bolles that i
he had a revolver with htm and. if neces
sary, would use it. Bolles called him a ;
coward for carrying a revolver and threat
ened to whip him when he met him with
out one. Shafer then left him and walked
down the street.
Bolles stood for a moment watching j
Sliafer and then started down the street in
the fame direction. He soon overtook
Shafer who, without further talk, turned
and fired. The bullet struck Bolles in the
abdomen. They were about fifteen feet
apart. â¢ The wounded man reeled and
staggered to the edge of the Mdewalk,
where he sat down. Shafer returned the ,
revolver to his rocket and walked away.
Constable Mack, who was some distance :
down the street at the time, came running
up on hearing ti.e BhQt. Shafer immedi
ately surrendered and was taken to jail, j
Doctors were sent for and every effort was
mad* to aave Bo'iles' life, but he was bleed
ing internally and nothing could be done
lor him. He died in about thirty rein- !
utes. Before I â¢â¢- <leath he made a state
ment to me oil;, era declaring that he had
been shot by Xix fchaferand that he had j
done nothing io provoke the shooting. ,
Bolles had been employed as a laborer
in this locality for some time and was re- â¢
garded as a troublesome character while >
under the influence of liquor, although â 
good-natured enough when sober. When !
in his cups he delighted in exhibiting his
great strength. Young Shafer was raised i
in this city, where bis parents and other '
relatives now reside. He has never evinced
a desire for hard work, and has generally â 
been considered as posing for a reputation i
as a bad man. Although often in trouble ;
this was his first serious offense.
He has generally been haunting the ,
streets and saloons, and has been known
10 make threats of what he would do to i
people who came under the ban of hie
dislike.
The body of Bolles was removed to the
morgue, and the coroner summoned a jury,
which met at 11 o'clock and viewed the re
mains. The jury then adjourned n;i til
Tuesday evening, when the examination
will be held. In the meantime an autopsy
will be held upon the body. A brother of
the dead man, Robert Boiles, is living at
Turlock, aud other relatives are resident at
Potosi, Wisconsin.
Young Shafer had been engaged in an
altercation with another man earlier in
tne morning, during which he was struck
on the head with a bottle. His adversary
wears mourning on one of his eyes, where
Sliafer afterwards struck him with a brick.
HILLSBORD' S SENSATION.
Congressman-Elect Tongue Accused of
Conspiracy and Unprofessional
Conduct
HILLSBORO, Or., July 12.â Zeera Snow I
of Portland and S. B. Huston of this city
have brou hi suit in the Circuit Court of
Washington County against Thomas H.
Tongue, Congressman-elect for the First !
District; Jack-on Monroe, and James Im
brie. clerks of Washington County. In the
complaint filed Tongue is charged with I
having conspired Monroe and Imbrie 'â¢â 
to defraud the plaintiffs out of a one-half
interest in a judgment for $2800. The
judgment stood in the name of Jackson
Monroe, but the complaint alleges that
Tongue was tally advissd of plaintiffs' j
ownership of a portion of the same. It is '
also alleged in the complaint that Tongue
is the owner of a second mortgage on a
piece of land on which the judgment waa
a prior Hen.
Snow and Huston claim that Tongue,
although fully advised of tueir interest in
the judgment, colluded and conspired
with Monroe, and induced him, for a con
idcration, to satisfy the judgment for the
-rpose of defrauding the plaintiffs of
m. sir interest in it, and also for the pur
pose of letting Tongue's mortgage in as a
prior lien.
The most, serious complication in the
charge, however, is the allegation that
litigation over this judgment waÃ still
rending, and in such litigation Snow and
Huston represented Monroe, while Tongue
represented Elith Monroe. The claim is
made that Tongue has been also guilty of
unprofessional conduct.
ANCHORED AT SAN DIEGO.
Return of the Gunboat Alert Front South
American H'aten.
SAX DIEGO, Cat.., July 12.â The gun
boat. Alert arrived yesterday from Corinto,
and after taking on coal will proceed to
ban Francisco. Aside from a fouled bot
tom, which is the result of a cruise of a
year and a half in the tropics, the Alert is
in good condition, and the officers and
crew are well. The vessel was injured in a
collision in the harbor of Guayaquil last
SeptemDer, and $10,000 was spent in re
pairs. Beyond tbis there was no bad luck
on the cruise. Au officer of the Alert
said:
"We left Callao the last day of Decem
ber and had made Acapulco and were ex
pecting to soon be in God's country when
we received orders to return to Corinto
and be on hand for any trouble during the
usual revolution. We were there in com
pany with the British gunboat Comus,
and took part in the protection of prop^
erty after the evacuation of the port.
Lieutenant Baker was in charge of the j
fifty men who were sent ashore from this
ship. A like number were sent from the
Comus. The affair was substantially as
j reported in the correspondence from Cor
into. It reaily didn't amount to much.
We saw only the tail-end of the thing, and
I witnessed the attempts of the refueees to
i escape. From Corinto we called at e very
port on th<Â» wav up, and we are all crazy
to get home. Tbe Alert will be docked
and scraped, but otherwise she is in good
! shape."
SEWALL'S BRUTAL NEPHEW.
A Bark Owner Accwed of Ilaving Tor
tured penmen.
SEATTLE, Waph., July 12.âVice-Presi
dential Candidaie Arthur Sewall has a
very brutal nephew in the person of Cap
tain Benjamin R. Sewall, master and
owner of the bark Benjamin Sewall, if the
| testimony of a dozen or so of sailors is to
| be believed. Last month Captain Sewall
was tried, with Mate Smith of the Sewall,
before the Federal Court in this city, for
extreme brutality in having beat and
| abused Seaman Mille.* until the sailor, in
j order to escape their torture, jumped over
! board when the vessel was far out in the
I Pacific and was drowned.
The jury brought in a verdict of guilty
against tne mate, but found CaDtain Se
\v;iil not guilty. The mate was sentenced
to one year's imprisonment and to pay a
fine of* $1000, whereupon Smith declared
that if he had suspected Â»uch a fate lie
would, in his testimony, have told the
J truth rather than shield Sewall, who, he
; asserteu, was in reality the guilty one.

PORTLAND DAMAGE SUIT,
Emily House, a Schoolteacher,
Alleges Defamation of
Character.
Discharged Frrm a Position Because
Accus?d cf Revilinj Ameri
canism
PORTLAND, Or., July 12.â Emily
House, the English woman who recently
lost her position as teacher in the school
between Sandy and Fairview, because, it
was said, she taught an unÂ»American doc
trine io her pupils, has filed suit in the
State Circuit Court against Andrew Henn
for $12,000 damages. Henn was instru
mental in causing Miss House to lose ter
position, and she avers that he slandered
her and defamed her character, and has
hu:t her standing and reputation as a
teacher. There are four distinct and sepa
rate causes of action, as set forth in the
complaint, and on each count $3000 dam
ages is asked.
The trouble was all caused, so the plain
tiff says, by Henn accusing her of telling
th â¢â  school children that the history of this
creat American Republic was all lies, and
by otherwise conducting Herself in an un
patriotic manner. The first $3000 charge
that Miss House makes against the defend
ant is that in February. 1896 ne of
her in the presence of numerous persons,
in the following terms:
"She is nothing but a traitor and is
teaching high treason."
The second charge is that Henn, on an
other occasion, said :
"She teaches the children that the his
tory of the United States is all lies; and
that is high treason, and she is insane, or
nearly so."
On May 23, while testify ins: in a case in
the Justice Court for the Powell Valley
District, the plaintiff says Henn again
stated that she taught the children high
treason, and ttiat this answer on his part
was not responsive to the question pro
pounded to him, and his statement was
made with malicious intent to injure her.
FRASER RIVER GOLD
San Franciscans Heaping a Barrett
From the .lll nek Hand.
VANCOUVER, B. C., July 12.â 1t has
been known for a long time that the black
sand of the Fraser river contained a large
quantity of gold, but there was no Cana
dian company of sufficient capital or en
terprise to work the sand in quantities.
At last the New Westminster Board of
Trade invited a number of San Francisco
capitalists to establish a black sand pul
verizing works in New Westminster. On
the strength of this invitation a company
was formed in San Francisco. The com
pany's works have been running night and
day for a short time, and have treated 250
tons of sand scooped from the Fraser, ex
tracting therefrom $800 in flake gold, or
$30 worth of cold to the ton. As the black
sand of the Fraser Is limitless, It is prob
able the company will reap a rich harvest
of gold. It is purchasing $20,000 worth of
additional machinery.

Camp Montgomery, |
League of the Cross Caditb.V
Agia Caliekte, Cal.. July 12. )
This was the last day of the encamp
ment. An immense crowd arrived on the
morning train from San Francisco, and
the visitors saw a camp that had not de
creased a particle in its picturesqueness
from having been occupied eight dayÃ.
All the streets were clean and all the flags
flying. There were as many ladles in
camp to-day as men. Many parties
brought their luncheons and picnicked
under the trees.
Military mass was sung, beginning
about 11 o'clock, Rev. Father McDonald
officiating. A temporary altar was erected
and the troops assembled before it in two
right-angles, forming a hollow square, at
the open side of which was the altar.
Many people wero present from the sur
rounding country. A huge canopy over
spread the congregation.
At the conclusion of mass Rev. Father
P. C. Yorke delivered a short sermon. He
tonk his text from that chapter of Mat
thew in which tue Lord is addressing the
people, saying, "Ye cannot get grapes
from thorns nor figs from thistles."
Father Yorke said that wlien Jesus
uttered those words he was traveling
through Palestine, a country in many re
spects much like California. It was a
fruit-raising country, and the Lord spoke
to the people in a language they could un
derstand by makine illustrations from
things in their daily life. As Jesus had
said to the people, "Not every one who
says Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom
of heaven, but he that doeth the will of
my Master, which is in heaven," bo Father
Yorke said, in addressing the young men,
tl at he who at this time would enter
heaven must do more than wear the cross
and attend divine worship. Hemustobev
the law oi the Master. Work and not words
wonld earn the kingdom of heaven.
Father Yorke in bis sermon compli
mented the cadets on their gentlemanly
conduct while in camp.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the bugle
sounded and then the cannon roared. It
was a signal for lowering "Old Glory," j
which has waved over th camp from the j
first day. Next all the tents were pulled i
down together, and when the whole city i
fell to the ground cheers from the cadets j
rent the air. Where a moment before
there were rows and rows of tents, now a
carpet of white canvas covered the earth.
The packing of personal effects was quickly j
completed, and then with knapsacks and
blankets on tneir backs, and their sabers
shining in the sun, the cadets had a final
dress parade. It was the mo*t imposing
one of the week, as every cadet was in the
; ranks. When the long excursion train
, stopped at the camp cadets and visitors
i jumped aboard, and the camp whicn had
been the scene of so much activity for
eight days became a barren and deserted
scene. A small rear guard was left behind
to pack the freight.
The tent known as "The Four Angels"
won the first prize of $7 50 for the best
kept tent during the encampment in Com
pany A. The tent was occupied by Cor
poral Robert Steele and Privates "Jack"
Corkery, Frank Hogan and Kd McSorley. |
The second Company A prize of $2 50 was
awarded to the tent placarded "De Bow
ery." It was occupied by Corporal P. H. ]
McCarthy and Privates Walter Young,
Ed Moore and Richard O'Connor. The
competition in Company I for the best
kept tent resulted in a tie and the $10
prize money was evenly divided. Car
; poral Frank Hicks and Private* William
I McCarthy. Herman Yerg, John Riley and
! William Cain occupied one tent, and Cor
poial John Raaford and Privates Joseph
Ward, Dan Keardon, George Merrill, Alex
exander McNeil and Charles Lyons the
other. There was much rivalry to secure
prizes.
About fifty visitors, most of whom were
ladies, came out to Camp Montgomery on
the morning train yesterday. They spent
the day strolling around the camp and vi
king points of interest in the neighborhood.
The (aliente Springs Hotel being still
crowded and the accommodations in camp
limited, before noon bunks on the hay
in the neighboring barns were at a pre
mium.
Yesterday the camp suffered from short
rations for the first time. The number of
visitors was larger than wa9 expected, and,
though preparations were made for an ex
tra number, when the visitors had been
served the "grub" was exhausted. The
result was that the officers and a few of
the guests had to go foraging fur their
luncheon.
While the gallant Captain Hajjgerty was
reclining in the friendly shade of a liveoak
tree chatting to lady friends yesterday
morning, a crowd of cadets slipped up and
pounced on him.
The captain was bound hand and foot
amid much hilarity. Those who were not
busy binding him stood around and whis
tled In the peculiar way which signifies
wind and whiskers, for the captain has
not shaved since his arrival. Captain
Haggerty was lifted up bodily and dropped
upon a stretcher. He was then carried
over to the tent of tbe camp barber, while
the crowd followed behind, whistling.
All that saved Haggerty's incipient whis
kers was the, absence of the barber. It
was the intention of "de push" to shang
hai or hang the barber had he iefused to
shave the captain.
Colonel Hooper, who lives in the vicin
ity, entertained Father Yorke, Father Mc-
Donald, Father O'Ryan, Father Lyons
and Dr. A P. Mulligan yesterday after
noon. Among the visitors to tne camp
yesterday were "Whisky" M. H. Kelly of
San Francisco and J. H. Seipp, president
of the Trustees of the town of Sonoma.

VALLEJO, Cal., July 12.â There are
now nearly 1000 men employed at the
navy yard. Half of that number are in
the construction department. Before the
month ends there will be 1000 men in that
department alone.
The work is on hand and needs to be
done. The Ranger is to have a complete
overhauling. Engines are being taken out
to allow the shin carpenters to put a new
wooden skin on the inside of the hull.
This will require much time. The Ranger,
when complete, will be modernized in
many respects. The new guns to be
mounted are of an improved pattern.
Months will elapse before the Baltimore
can be repaired. The Concord has had its
propeller removed preparatory to having
new wood backing placed on the shaft
hole. The Benr.ington will by the middle
of the week be ready for sea. A full com
plement of men is on board. It is not
known whither the gunboat is likely to
be sent.

ROMANCE OF McMINNVILLE.
Chance Meeting of a Son of John Brown
and a Son of the Sheriff Who
Hanged Him.
McMINNVIILE, Or., July 12.â Two
men of historical connections met by
chance here during the Bimetallic Con
vention Thursday. As is tbe custom in
all conventions in Oregon every delegate
docs his best to get acquainted with every
other one, and all delegates converse with
each other whether acquainted or not.
Several were going about introducing a
rather handsome man of 40 or thereabouts
whom they called Mr. Booth of McMinn
ville. They would say of him: "Mr.
Booth is the son of tbe Sheriff who hanged
John Brown of Ossawatomie at Harper's
Ferry." This caused people to take more
than a common interest in Mr. Booth.
Finally Booth was introduced to a man
of excellent appearance, whose name was
Salmon Brown. After the introduction
Mr. Booth and Mr. Brown chatted very
pleasantly for a minute or two.
"Mr. Booth," suld Mr. Brown, "was it
your father who hanged John Brown at
Harper's Ferry?"
"Yes," sal.l Mr. Booth. "He was Sher
iff at the time and it was Ms duty to of
ficiate at the execution. No relative of
yours, I hope?"
"Only my father." was the quiet reply.
Mr. Booth and Mr. Brown walked to a
quiet corner in the hotel and talked over
oid times for a half hour and shook hands
cordially when separating.
QUEER ARREST
AT SANTA CRUZ,
Capitalist Cunningham Gets
Into Court as a
Cracksman.
LOOTING HIS OWN SAFE.
Employed an Expert to Secure
Papers Kept From Him by
His Partners.
FOILED BY AN ALERT OFFICER.
Sensational Result of a Quarrel
Between Members of a
Corporation.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., July 12.â The so
cial and religious attractions of a Santa
Cruz Sabbath were given the spice of a
procedure in a Justice's court against J. F.
Cunningham and Jules Ny this morning.
It was no common misdemeanor, but an
offense against propertyâ an attempt to
crack a safe in broaa daylight for a legiti
mate purpose. Whether or not a safe can
be legally cracked is a question of law tt>at
will be considered first by Justice Gardner
and probably afterward by Judge Logan
of the Superior Court. That the safe was
not opened was due to the watchfulness of
the officer, who permitted on'.y an attempt
before he placed the parties under arrest,
md directed them to appear before the
Justice.
The Grover-Cunningham Mill and Lum
ber Company, whose safe Mr. Cunning
ham sought to open, is a corporation
formed of the S. F. Grover Company and
the J. F. Cunningham Company, both
formerly engaged in the lumber and mill
business. At the formation of the present
corporation 1000 shares of stock were is
sued, of which the Grover Company re
ceived 495 and the Cunningham Company
an equal number. The ten remaining
shares were equally divided between J. F.
Cunningham, J. W. Cunningham, T. V.
Mathews, S. F. Grover and D. W. Grover,
who formed the board of directors.
At the June meeting of the board the
dissatisfaction that has existed between
the Cunninghams and Mathews on the
one side and the Grovers on the olher re
sulted in the former, who formed the ma
jority of tne board, discharging D. W.
Grover from his position as assistant man
ager and Secretary Williams from his po
sition as bookkeeper.
The Grovers then sought legal advice,
j and took the ground that this combina
tion of corporations was not a legal cor
poration, an-1, while the Cunningham
faction proceeded to change the locks on
the doors of the buildings and quietly bar
the Grovers out on occasion, the Grovers
resorted to a scheme that greatly puzzled
the Cunninghams. The handsome safe,
into the door of which Jules Ny, the
expert sate man drilled a hole this morn
ing, is the alleged personal property of
the Grovers, and they placed the books
and accounts of the corporation within
its iron and ateei walls aud changed the
combination.
J. F. Cunningham was not to be balked
by such trivial a thing as a safe locked with
a combination whi;h he did not know.
He sent to San Francisco for Expert Jules
Ny. Ny arrived last night, and at 7
o'clock this morning, while the town
was quiet and peaceful, before tbe pleas
ure-seekers and church-goers had begun
to fill the streets, Mr. Cunningham con
ducted the expert to the office of the
Grover-Cunningbam corporation and di
rected him to proceed to open the safe.
Constable Joe Harveston was also there,
with instructions from the Grovers to pre
vent the opening of the sÂ»ie. Harveston
warned them not to proceed, if that was
their intention, but they heeded him not.
Ny, nnder direction of Mr. Cunningham,
j proceeded to the drilling of a hole in the
! safe door. Tbe officer stopped the work
: by th* majesty of the law, and the parties
repaired to Justice Gardner's court. Tuere
Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Ny were charged
with an offense against property, and the
hearing of the case was postponed until
July 20. In the mean time the safe must
remain unmolested by either person.
District Attorney Limit-ay has been attor
ney for the Grovers, but his official posi
tion rendered it necessary that ether coun
sel appear for tbe civil interest of the case,
and Jnilce J. H. Bkirm was made attorney
of record, while Senator Bart Burke ap
peared for the Cunning amÂ«. The de
fendants were allowed to go on their own
recognizance, as the case will be conducted
only as a civil action.

LAW OF PUEBLO LANDS
City and County Attorney Cres
well Says the City Can
Not Sell Them.
City and County Attorney Creswell has
advised the Board of Supervisors that the
City cannot, Under present existing laws,
sell any of the pueblo hinds remaining in
its hands, and that,' therefore, John Cen
ter cannot be forced to pay the remainder
! of the purchase price of a portion of Mis-.
i sion block ; No. 48, on which he was the
highest bidder nt a recent sale. .
Mr. Creswell's opinion is as follows:
â  To the Honorable, the Board of Supervisors:
The communication of Hon. Ado.ph Sutro,
Mayor, to the Board of Supervisors, under date
of March 18, 1896, inclosing the form of a
deed, shows the following facts, viz : That on
December 2, 1895, a resolution was passed by
the board {So. 13,301, third series) empower
ing and requesting the Mayor to sell by public
auction, to the highest bidder, all that portion
of Mission block No. 48 belonging to the City,
lying and being in the bed of Mission Creek,
and that the proceeds of the Bale should be
paid Into the City treasury to the credit
of the Street Department fund; that
under the authority of this reso
lution Messrs. O. F." yon Rhein & Co.
were appointed by the Mayor to make such
sale, which was made after public notice to
John Center for $0400. who -then paid 10 per
cent of the amount of his bid ; that thereafter
on February 3, 1896, the milter of said sale
having been reported to the board, a resolu
tion (No. 13,718, third . r:es) was passed
which recited the facts of the sale, con armed
the same and empowered and requested the
Mayor to convey tho right, title Â»nd interest
of the City and County in the land sold to
John Center; that a deed was prepared by the
Mayor whic.l purported to convey the title of
the City and County in tho land to Mr Cen
ter, which he declined to receive and refused
to pay the remaining 90 per cent of bis bid
alleging in substance his willinaness to dÂ»v
provided the City could give him her title to
the land.
The Mayor, In his communication to" the
board, suggests that an action for specific per
formance be commenced by the City against
Mr. Center to compel him to accept the deed "
prepared in consequence of the facts above
recited and pay the balance of the purchase
price* uSÃ^Bp^MÃSSÃPQÃ^|Btt4B^tiKtttiS9tt^- vr
~F?$$ T } h law of " the State (section 3394,
Civil Code;, "an agreement lor the sale of prop
erty cannot be specifically enforced in Fnvor
of a seller who cannot give to the buyer a title
(rep from reasonable doubt." -
The question -then squarely presents itself,
Can the City give to Mr. Center, at this time
a title tree from reasonable doubt? If such a
title cannot :be given by the City, then such
an action must inevitably fail.
- In my opinion the City cannot now give Mr.
Center such a title. The land in question was
not in the possession of any person on the Ist
day of January, 1855, and therefore is a part
of the residue of the pueblo lands which by
the decree of Justice Field in tho case of San
Francisco vs. United States (4 Sawyer, 5Â»3, is
held in trust "for the use and benefit of the
inhabitants of tho City of SÂ«n Francisco. It
has frequently been decided by the Supreme
Court of California "that the tenure by which
the lands (pueblo lands) were held was of a
fiduciary nature and could not be alienated
except in accordance with the trust and it
was for the Legislature to decide how the trust
should be performed." (San Francisco vs. Cana
van, 43 Cal. 536.) . m
The Legislature has never passed any act
authorizing the sale of the whole or any part
of the residue of the pueblo lands of this City
and county, unlese such power nas or P e Â®"_" >n -
ferred by the act approve d March ii, iÂ»/4.â
(Statutes 1873-4, p. 711^ This act, in my
opinion, confers no such power. True it au
thorises and requires the Board of Super
visors, "under such rules and regulations as
they may prescribe, to sell at public auction,
to the highest and best bidders, all of said
Channel street and Mission creek from Isinth
to Eighteenth streets, except such portions
thereof as may be required for the purposes
of the sewer and street" therein provided for.
This act was considered by the Supreme
Court in San Francisco vs. Ellis, 54 Cal. ,Z,
and tho record of tnla case shows conclusively
that the title author. zed by the act to be dis
posed of was the title of the State and not the
title of the City to the residue of its pueblo
lands. _
The Legislature by the act made the Board
of Supervisors the medium through which the
State would sell land then supposed to be
owned by the State. Not until the decision of
the Supreme Court of the United States, on
December 21, 1891, in the case of Thomas
Knight vs. United Land Association (142 U. S.
101) and others, adjudging the Yon Leicht
lurvey of December 18, 1883, to be the correct
survey of the pueblo of San Francisco, was it
known mat these lands did not belong to the
State.
The Intention of the Legislature in the
passage of this act, ascertained from contem
poraneous history, was to fell land that be
lones to the State, and not to grant a power to
sell any part of the residue of the pueblo lands
of the City. The act cannot now be made to
apply to the pueblo lands when it was not the
intention of the Legislature that it should ap
ply to them. It must then necessarily follow
that there is no law authorizing the board to
Bell any of the residue of tbe pueblo lands of
the City, and as the land put up for sale at
auction by authority of the board and bid in
by Mr. Center was a part of the resiaue of such
pueblo lands, that the authorization for such
sale giveu by the board was void. The author
ization to sell being void, the sale was void.
The board not having had the power to
mnke the aale had no power afterward to
ratify the sale that was made, because it could
only ratify that which ii had the power to do.
If Mr. Center 6hould pay to the City the
amount of his bid and receive a deed from the
Mayor, in my opinion, he would not, In the
language of the code, receive "a title free from
reasonable doubt," but would in fact receive
no title at all.
For these reasons a cuit for specific perform
ance, in my opinion, cannot be maintained by
the City against Mr. Center as suggested in the
communication of the Mayor.
Before any valid sale of the residue of the
pueblo lands can be made ii will be necessary
to have an act authorizing any such sale
passed by the Legislature.

Attorney and Counselor.
MINED IN NEVADA COUNTY
Where Richard P. Bland First
Became a White-Metal
Enthusiast.
Handled Pick and Shovel and "Bunked"
in a Cabin on Relief
Hill.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., July 12.â The
Transcript last evening said: Compara
tively few of our readers know of the fact
that Hon. 1L P. Bland, one of the promi
nent candidates ior President before the
National Democratic Convention at
Chicago this week, was once a resident
of Nevada County. In 1857 "Dick," as all
his acquaintances called him, lived at
Relief Hill and workea in the mines. He
also taught school for a short time, find
ing the latter occupation more congenial
to bis nxture than the laborious task of â 
wielding pick and shovel.
Constable William Scott of this city was
mining on Relief Hill in those days and
lived in the same cabin with Bland. This
cabin was about thirty feet iong by
twenty wide and built of double rows of
logs. In one end waa a row of bunks in
which tne men slept, the cabin being
occupied by several miners, while a
kitchen was located at the other end of tbe
room.
This was the rough domicile in which
the future politician and statesman made
his home for several months.
After living at that place about a year
Bland drifted over to Washoe, in the State
of Nevada. There he lived a few years,
being on the Comstock when the silver
excitement was at its height. There he
formed the acquaintance of men who
afterward became prominent, and there
he gained an insight into the importance
of tne silver-mining industry that in latT
years caused him to appear as one of tho
strongest advocates in the halls of Con
gress in favor of the white metal, gome
years later he returned to "the States"
and located in Missouri, becoming one of
the foremost men of that State.

STAND ALONE,
Leading Members of the
Party Say There Can't
Be Fusion.
THE CRY OF "THIEF!"
Democracy Charged With Steal
ing a Plank From Their
Platform.
WOULD PKEFEK DLFEAT NOW
Anything R.ther Than Compromise
on Cond.tions That Would Not
Help the Country.
WHEKEAS, The People's party of the |
fnited States' is now a National party
and has cant 2,000,000 votfS on it plat
form involving a full financial reform,
direct legislation and the abolition of
t ru.i" and oppressive monopolies, and j
whÂ«rca>, the Democratic party in its
death throe* has stolon one little silver
plank only from our platform and now
again masquerades bvfor c tho country.
RESOLVKD, That we the County Com
mittee of the People's party of the City
and County of San Francisco are unal
trvably opposed to any fusion whatever
with either of the old political parties;
therefore be it further
RKSOLTKD, That we Insist that our
National convention must take no retro
gressive steps 'whatever, but must ad
here to each and every principle laid
down in the Omaha platform.
The Populists will have nothing to do
with the Democrats because a silver plank
has been inserted in the Democratic plat
form. Their principles, they proudly
maintain, are like truth â unchangeable â
and consequently the People's party under
no consideration can afford to co so far as
a compromise by fusion with the Demo
crats all on account of silver â which the
Populists claim was niched from their
code of principles. Lest any one might |
mistake their attitude on this subject the
Populists have come out boldly and de
nounced the possibility of fusion with
Democrats â at least with the silver half
of what used to be the Democratic party.
At a meeting Saturday night the Ban
Francisco County Committee discussed
this question in all its phases, so that
there remained no point unconsidered.
They asserted in their preamble that
the People's party was no longer a side
show in the political arena, but a potent
factor of more than 2,000.000 votes; that
their principles were immutable and more
sacred than personal aggrandizement or
temporary benefits, or something to that
effect, and then they resolved that they j
were unalterably opposed to any union
whatsoever with the jilverites. They also
insisted on their National Convention ad
hering to the principles laid down in the
Omaha convention.
But the lines that cut to the quick were
these:
The Democratic party in its death !
throe* has stolen one little si'ver plank
only from uur platform, and now again
masquerades before the country.
These slings and arrows are hard to bear.
They have widened the breach. They
have branded the Democratic National
Convention with a crime, and here a rec- !
ognized organization of the People's party i
cries at the Democrats, "Thief! Thief!" j
So how can they fuse now?
The local leaders of the Populists are no j
less backward in expressing their opin
ions. They, too, cry "Thief!" And they
declare that the Democratic silver scheme
does not even come up to their views,
since it is not at all the same proposition
as that formulated/ by the People's party
concerning money.
Â£. S. Barney, chairman of the San Fran
cisco People's Party County Committee,
claimed yesterday that fusion with the
silver wing of Democracy was utterly im
possible.
"No doubt Bryan has been put np for a
purpose," said he. "He comes from a
State nearly all Populists. This resolution
from our committee last night is not an
instruction to our delegates who s?o to St.
Louis, for they go uninstrncted. They are
free to do as they please, but these resolu
tions show the sentiments of the People's
party on the question.
"One thing I can assure you, if Mr.
Bryan wants the support of the People's
party, he will have to indorse the entire
platform of the People's party. But I'm
sure they'll not give it to him, nor do I
believe that he will do this. If he won't
there is no earthly show of indorsing him.
"The sentiment of the majority of the
County Committee is carried out in these
resolutions. Tne Populists have advo
cated silver for eight years and it has
gradually grown till adopted by the Demo
cratic party. Why should we adopt Mr.
Bryan because he has taken np one of our
planks? It is not a vital question of our
platform, but merely one of them. The
People's party is a reform party. It may
never get into power, but it stands for the
reforms of the day, and some day these re
forms will take root Because they have
been made by honest people. It makes
almost a political martyr of a man to be
long to the party. There is no office in
sight
"A genuine People's party man will
never leave the middle of the road. Of the
old-line men who have been in the work
for years one plank cannot scatter them.
The sentiment expressed last night was
that we had every confidence in our dele
gates, and that we left it all to them. The
People's party goes further. We are fight
ing for direct legislation and that we
should rule ourselves. It would certainly
be plain frorx this that the party cannot
flop over to the Democratic party. It
would destroy the integrity of the party.
The bitterest enemy the people have in the
South is the Democrat. If there be any
fusion in the South it would be with the
Republicans, who assist the Populists
there against their common enemy."
Dr. Daywalt, who is a prominent mem
ber of the executive committee of the
Populist county committee and grand
medical director of the Ancient Order
United Workmen, was bitterly opposed to
fusion.
"The trouble is," be said, "the Demo
crats want silver restored as redemption
money, whereas the Populists demand
that sliver be restored to unlimited coin
age. Yet if there be not sufficient money
to do the business of the country, let it be
supported with a currency on the credit of
the Nation, not to have it redeemable by
gold or silver. In other words, the Popu
lists want money to consist of gold, silver
and paper, each dollar to be of equal value,
irrespective of the substance from which
it is made, and to be redeemable in the
other, and to be a full leiÂ»al tender for all
payments. We want the Government to
come in competition with the banks to
issue money to the people.
"Now, how Mr. Bryan can accept the
nomination from the Populists when our
platform is totally at variance with the
money conception of the Democrats, I
don't see. The Populists cannot afford to
go before the country and say with the
Democrats: 'Restore silver to the function
of redemption money, and all the ills of
humanity will be removed,' because the
Populists would be left in the lurch.
"Those are my reasons for thinking that
fusion is out of the question. One thing is
sureâ there can be no fusion with the Dem
ocrats by the Populists accepting the Dem
ocratic platform as a substitute for their
ideas. They could not accept it either as
a compromise measure for the issues for
which the Populist party stands are
uncompromisable.
"The People's party at large consists of
men who are advocating principles which
they believe are for the good of the
country, and so they would better go down
to honorable defeat than to compromise
on conditions that would not help the
country. That platform of the Demo
crats is a conglomeration of nonsense â a
poor attempt at putting- modern new
Populist wine into the old bottles of
I Democracy."
BOHEMIA CRICKETERS WIN
Playing the Pacific Ciub They
Gain a Very Easy
Victory.
The California Eleven Is Badly De-
feated by the Alameda
Team.
The two cricket matches played yester
day in the Hunter-Harrison cup contest
resulted in two most decisive victories. !
At Alameda the Pacifies were pitted
against ihe Bohemians and were com
pletely snowed under. It was not their
day. Captain Robertson of the Bohemians
had evidently resoived to win the match,
and he did it unaided.
Captain Theobald of the .Pacifies, win
ning the toss, sent his opponents in. The
first three wickets fell without many runs
being scored â and then. Then the re
doubtable Billy took center, an'', outliving
the rest of his team, put up 106 runs in
almost faultlps.s pl.-iy. He was aided and
abetted to the exientof seventy runs, so
that the side's to al reached 176. CasMy
and Dickinson shared the bowling honors
for the Facih'cs.
The latter-named team, with the strong
est force they have managed to cluster this
year, ibon went to bat. Richardson, to
whom their hopes were mainly fixed, suc
ceeded in reaching double figures, when
he succumbed to a leg breaker of Robert
son's. After his downfall the issue was
quickly reached, the whole side being dis
posed of for a modest 37.
They followed on and made a good show
ing for the loss of one wicket, but this did
not avail to alter the result, which was in
favor oi the Bohemians by 139 on the first
innings. The score:

The bowling of -Robertson, who did the
"hat trick," and his colleague, Coouson,
was the feature of this innings.
Meanwhile the Alamedas were having a
"walkover" in their match with the Cali

the latter did creditably in amassing a

Cars as Late as Is
The French residents of the CUy and its
environments were busily engaged yester
day in making preparations for a crand
celebration of the Fall of the Bastile, the
anniversary of which event occurs next
Tuesday. The Chutes grounds have been
selected for the scene of the festivities, and
the wry active committee chosen from the
local French societies has made arrange
ments for a celebration commensurate
with the enthusiasm of the resident ad
herents of the tricolor and befitting the
importance of the occasion commemo
rated.
Some dissatisfaction was at first evinced
at tLe â election of the Chutes grounds.
Last year the affair was observed by a
grand picnic at Shell Mound Park and
that was considered a most successful ar
rangement. Particularly were the older
members of the colony pleased with the
opportunity afforded for a quiet day's out
ing with their families. The younger
members, however, preferred a celebra
tion in the City where then could oe fire
works galore, dancing until dawn, if they
desired, with no inexorable ferry-boat to
place an arbitrary time limit on their en
joyment.
The older members good-naturÂ«>dly re
signed their preference and now everybody
is working heartily to make the occasion
one from which French residents can count
time.
Just how many celebrants there will be
on the grounds It is difficult to say. Oak
land, Alameda, Berkeley, Sausalito and,
in fact, all the outlying towns will join
with San Francisco, and many individual
parties from San Jose, Sacramento, Stock
ton and other cities which will have cele
brations of their own will proba ly take
occasion to meet their countrymen of this
City. Certain it is the crowd will number
many thousands.
The literary exercises will take place in
the pavilion at 2 o'clock. After an over
ture by the band Sylvain Weill, president
of the day, will make *n address.
The orchestra will then play "Hail Co
lumbia." followed by an oration by Alex
andre Lawrence de Lalande, the French
Consul. The French singing society will
rpnder in chorus, "Sur le Ramparts," and
M. E. Kuowlton will deliver an address in
English. Mrs. L. Fighter will sing the
"Star-spangled Banner," M. J. Dupuy
will deliver. the address in French ana "La
Marseillaise," without which no patriotic
French programme would be complete,
will be sung cÂ»y .\i. Marcel Perron, accom
panied by the French singing society. A
selection by the orchestra will conclude
the afternoon's programme.
Owing to theinadequency of the pavilion
it is not expected that near all present will
be able to witness the exercises. For the
benefit of those who cannot and those
who do not care to enter the pavilion a
band wiii be employed on the outside all
day. In the evening there will be a band
in the pavilion for dancing and also one
on the outside.
Special arrangements have been made
with the car companies whereby cars can
be run all night if necessary, so the young
people will have no cause to complain of
thÂ«>ir pleasure being curtailed.
The great leature of thn evening's enter
tainment will be a magnificent fireworks
display. There will be besides the rockets,
bombs and smaller pyrotechnics, a num
ber of set pieces. The first of these will
be the word "welcome." There will be a
beautiful piece representing the French
and American flags intertwined with the
dates '76 and '89, the great years in the
countries' histories. The seal of Califor

representation of the bastile will be given

WILL SEEK THEIR RIGHTS.
Fourth-Street Property-Owners to
Organize an Improve
ment Club.
An Effort Will Be Made to Have the
Thoroughfare Placed in Good
Condition.
Property-owners and residents on
Fourtn street, between Market and Fol
som, will make an effort to have the City
powers that be improve that important
thoroughfare by putting down a respect
able pavement.
The first step in this direction will be
made to-night at 7 Fourth street, when an
improvement club will be organized. The
leaders in the movement are: J. M.
Strauss, Arthur Manderlein, Henry
Schulz. Joseph Hammond and ex-Super
visor Sullivan, though these rive gentle
men are backed by several hundred
people.
In view of the fact that the Market
street company is now engaged in build
ing an electric road on Fourth street and
consequently tearing up the thorough
fare to an appreciable degree, the people
think it a good time for the City to get in
and put down a respectable pavement.
The present "apoloiy,"' they argue, is
worse than no pavement at all, because
the cobbles have become so worn with
years of constant travel as to render it
practically impossible for heavily loaded
teams to move with any degree of com
fort or safety.
In consequence of this much of the
traffic is diverted to other streets.inflictiug
a daily loss on the property-owners.
Fourth street is an accepted thoroughfare,
and ihe city is pledged to keep it in good
order. It is thought, there lore, by tnose
directly interested that if the situation is
properly placed before the city authorities
they will not longer neglect to do what
they claim should have been done many
months ago.
It is expected that every property-owner
interested in the movement will attend
the meetiuE to-night.
A Visiting Bishop.
Bishop Hendrix of Kansas City, Mo., preached
yesterday morning at the Centenary Methodist
Episcopal Church South, on Bush street near
Octavia. Bisbop Hendrix, who is one of the
bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church
South, is at present visiting In this State, and
quite a good-sized congregation listened to
Him yesterday, considering tnat many are
away from the city at present on their vaca
tions. The presiding elder of the dfstrlct occu
pied the pulpit in the evening.
An Engineer Wedded.
W. C. W. Lyon, the chief engineer of the
steamer Monticello, and Miss W. A. Brnhn,
daughter of P. F. Bruhn, were wedded yester
day at tne residence of the bride's parents, 21
Rondell place. The groom was at one time an
Arctic explorer, and has bad many thrilling
experiences iv the land of the Esquimau,
THE ARMY OF
JESUS CHRIST,
A Queer Little Secession
From the Salvation
Army.
IT HAS "TALENT" IN IT.
The "General" and Organizer
Has a Big Ambi
tion
BUT A VERY SMALL AUDIENCE.
It Has Temporarily Suspended the
Barber Business oa Account
of Drunkenness.
There is a queer little religions "army"
operating in Merchants street, just oppo
site Dunbar alley, with its Morgue and
lately the police station.
The headquarters is a naturally dismal
little room decked out in American flags
and tricolored bunting.
The front of the place is forbidding, the
doors and windows beinsr covered, with
boards nailed over them, and wearing the
appearance of the last stage of dilapida
tion. Above the door is the legend :
"Jesus Christ's Armyâ services between 8
and 10 p. m."
Inside the little room there is a number
of rude benches, a small platform in the
rear, with a Â«tand covered with wall paper
and decorated also with an American flag.
Above the stand against the wall is the
word "Welcome" in large, red ana blue
letters.
The room is twice partitioned so that
there are three in one. The main di
vision is in the center, and on the other
sida of it. so the general says, are sleepirg
bunks that may be engaged for 5 cents, in
cluding breakfast.
The other partition is a little square in
plain boards in the corner at the door and
forms the general's office, where he Keeps
the bass drum and tho one hymn book
belonging to his army.
In the corner of the general room with
the benches is a greasy and worn barber's
chair and against the plain boards of the
general's office is a notice printed in lead
pencil that the price of shaving is 5 cents
anil of hair-cutting 10 cents.
The shaving and hair-cutting branch of
the Army of Jesus Christ has been tempo
rarily suspended. A barber waa engaged
for some little time, but he was drunk
nearly all the time, and as General Dag
gan explained yesterday, "You know that
wouldn't do. We had to let him go."
General Duggan is the organizer of the
Army of Jesus Christ. He wears a bright
red cap with the name of the army in gold
across the front. The rest of the uniform
consists'of a long blue clerical frock coat
with big black buttons up the front and
stand-up collar. He wears no stars or
bars and calls attention to the plainness
of the outfit as showing that he does not
wish to heap distinction upon himself in
the matter of dress.
General Duggan was a soldier in the
ranks of the salvation army for several
years, he says, but left it upon discovering
that that organization did not do for the
poor what it professed to ; that instead of
giving away the clothes and provisions
donated for the purpose its officers sold
them.
The general organized the new army just
seven months a o and points with pride
to the achievements of that short time.
He says he is now feeding from fifteen
to twenty people a day at 5 cents each.
The kitchen is just back of the general
meeting-hall. Breakfast is served at 8
o'clock, when the men are turned out of
their cots, dinne 1 * at noon and supper be
tween 4 and 5. The religious services be
gin at 8 o'clock and continue until 10.
At 9 o'clock lasi night the services were
in full swing. A man with no uniform sat
at one end of the little platform, lustily
beating a bass drum, while the general
sang the well-known hymns in vogue with
the Salvation Army.
There were three men who sat on the
benches in front of the stand, silent
auditors. The bass drummer beat the
drum, but raised not his voice. The gen
eral changed the tune time and again, and
calling God's blessing upon his audience,
begged them to join him in the hymn.
But they would not.
An old woman in a room above the
saloon across the street, annoyed by the
constant hammering of the drum, was
beating a pair of tin pans together out of
her raised window.
Some children amused themselves by
rolling rocks into the room. None of
these things annoyed the general in the
least, so far as apparent, but the burden
of sustaining tie interest of his audieuce
sat upon him heavily.
He sang four hymns in succession", and
the audience was showing some si<ms of
restlessness under the monotony. He be
gan the fifth but pitched it too "hieh, and
was forced to change it again, explaining
that he had a cold. While he hurriedly
thumbed over the leaves of the hymn
book, he promised the audience that if it
would only wait a while "two of the best
singers in the army" would be there pres
ently, as also "some other talent."
He went over and whispered to the man
at the drum. The man nodded and let the
drum down off his knees.
"We will have seme experiences," said
the general in a tone of infinite relief.
The drummer, a heavy, unhappy-looking
man, rose and said: "I haven't much to
say. lam a Christian, and I advise you
fellows to come up and get religion and
find happiness. If you put something in
the collection, too, it will be appreciated
and will help the general out; he needs
it"
He sat down and the general began in a
rather strident tone to say that his army
was international notwithstanding the dis
play of American flags. "We expect this
army to soon spread, not only across the
continent to New York, but to Europe and
all around the world. While we have the
American flag here we have no eagle, you
notice, which indicates that our army 13
not of one country, but is worldwide.

OFF TO YOSEMITE.
Seleot Parties for Whom Reduced Rates

The Yosemite Valley is just now at
tracting many visitors. Tourists juÂ«t re
turned from there report that conditions
are most favorable for those who desire to

special carriages, and all their hotel ac
commodations en route and while in the
valley will be furnished. Mr. Locke has
adopted the route via Merced and Coulter
ville, the one over which Governor Budd

the best advantages. Stops will be made
at Coulterville to visit the ureat mines
there, and at Bowers' Cave and the Mer
ced Big Trees, with a sojourn of several

FOR VICK-PRESIDKXT-
GARRET A. EOBART, or New Jersey
EtKCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Every time Democracy is born again, it
is born worse.
Tt.e chief issue of the campaign is to
down Altgeldism and anarchy.
If you have not yet registered you know
exactly what is yonr first duty to-day.
Conservative men must stand together
now. In a crazy Democracy there is dan
ger to all.
The fishing may be jjood at Buzzard's
Bay, but still the fisherman mutters in a
muffled monotone.
It is a sure sign of abnormal excitement
â when men would rather talk politics than
discuss the summer girl.
It was easy for Democracy to get rid of
its Cleveland, but the record stays and
the country remembers it.
This election ought to be settled by the
simple question to American common
sense: McKinley or Bryanâ which?
The iast hope of Democracy is in the be
lief that some of the hot stuff in Bryan
may help him to be a scorcher in the
race.
Fortunately the carnival will give us a
change during the campaign and the
monotony of the walk-over will be varied
a little.
The East will please take notice that
this transtuississippi candidate is a much
smaller potato tban we usually raise in
the great West.
There can be no prosperity without pub
lic confidence, and no confidence unless
conservative statesmen are at the head
of the Government.
The issue is the Union against sections
and the people against agitators, with the
Republican party as the champion of the
Nation and tbe law.
The Democratic campaign will haroly
be anything more than a Wild West show,
with an exhibition of an attempt to hold
up the stagecoach of progress.
One of the humors of the next ten days
will be tho attempt of the Democrats to
sprinkle salt on the tail of the Populist
bird and bring him into camp.
With Democracy rapidly disintegrating
nil over the Union the Populist leaders
would have a good deal less sense than
whiskers if they were to join it.
The gold States having bolted the Chi
cago ticket, what votes has Democracy in
the West to offer to Populists in return
for an indorsement at St. Louis?
At this juncture there is but one Na
tional party and, therefore, but one party
for men who desire the welfare of the
whole Nation and all the people.
Every Republican must rally to the
standard of the party and take part in the
battle for the business interests of the
country against free trade, Aitgeldism ana
ruin.
What patriot will vote against the sol
dier candidate, the hero statesman, Wil
liam McKinley, in favor of an Inexperi
enced demagogue, whose nomination was
c'.ue solely to his gift of gab?
Conservative Democrats are joining the
Kepublican party, the extremists will go
over to the Populists, and before the cam
paign is over Mr. Bryan, as well as Cleve
land, may know how it feels to be alone.
There were thousands of people on the
streets during tne Democratic ratification
meetings just as there are every night,
but somehow tney seemed duller, less
spirited nnd more oppressed with the
tired feeling than they generally are.
Recent explorations in Rome are said to
justify a belief that some of the tenement
houses of tbe city in the days of the
Cas?ars were more thau 100 feet high. The
sky-scraper, therefore, is not a new thing
under the sun and Chicago must take a
back seat.
'1 be fact that 162 delegates to the Demo
cratic National Convention refused to
vote on the Presidential nomination is a
true index to the condition of the Demo
cratic party throughout the country. The
elements of disintegration are in active
operation and must result in Democratic
defeat.
As the campaign progresses we shall
hear less and less about silver and more
and more about business, industry, law,
order, good government and all that makes
up the prosperity and greatness of tbe
Xi public. The issue is too plain for con
Â»c>.;lnipnt. We cannot let Bryan, Altgeld
and Tilman run this country.
THE CITIZEN'S DUTY.
He is not an ideal citizen who believes
his duty to the Government is confined
within the iimits of paying bis taxes and
obeying the laws. There are moral public
duties which no one can evade and still be
a good citizen. The spirit of such a gov
ernment as ours has a code of unwritten
!aws which imposes duties upon the citi
zen that are just as imperative in their
demand for faithful performance as any
legislative enactment is. He is not a good
citizen who is remiss in the performance
of any public duty because to perform it
would inconvenience him. There are
duties of citizenship very much higher
than allegiance to party. The public good
is first to be considered, and the really
good citizen is loyal to his party only in so
far as it is the party's purpose to adminis
ter ihe government in ways tbat shall
strengthen society and commerce.
Of the great and small duties that de
volve upon the citizen tho duty to take an
interest in those things which lead up to
the ballot-box and finally castinc his vote
is probably the most important. The man
who does not take an interest in the public
concern of the community in which he
lives and cast a ballot expressive of his
honest convictions as to what policy is
best says in effect that he cares little
whether there be law and order or an
archy, virtue or vice, honesty or dishon
esty in public life. Under our system of
government the voter is required to regis
ter at stated times for the purpose of estab
lishing bis eligibility, and the citizen who
does not register becomes an alien bo far
as the highest right of citizenship is con
cerned. The man who does not register
puts himself upon a level with the latest
arrival from China, and is in fact not a
whit better citizen in the eyes of the pub
lic good. The highest meaning of indi
vidual sovereignty implies a duty to vote
conscientiously upon all questions in
which the public has interest. To fail to
do that is to be unworthy of sovereignty.
The registration books are now open at
the City Hall and there are a given nnm
ber of dajs in which names maj' be reg
istered, and those who neglect to register
are. by their act, disfranchised. There are
more reasons this year why the good citi
zen should make haste to register than for
some years past. There will be advocated
for adoption the most dangerous theories
of Government that have ever confronted
the people. The once great Democratic
party has fallen under the control of such
men as Altgeld, Bryan and Tiliman and it
has been abandoned by its old leaders and
tbe thinking element of the rank and file.
It will be before the country asking for
votes to set aside all established govern
mental and commercial usages and adopt
in their stead theories that border close
upon the doctrine of tbe anarchist. More
over, the new leaders of that party assert
in their platform that should they secure
the reins of Government they will build
up the central States at the expense of the
Atlantic and pÃcific Coast countries by .im
proving the Mississippi River so that they
may have direct communication with the
cheap labor countries of the world on a
free-trade basis of commercial operations.
But this is not all that is threatening the
public good, as every one will see by read
ing the Aitgeld-Tillrnan-Bryan declara
tions. A knowledge of these threatening
dangers should, it would seem, be all
that is needed to convince overy good citi
zen that he owes it to himself, to nis neigh
bor and his country to speedily assume the
public responsibilities of citizenship by at
tending to his registration immediately.
FARMERS BOIES AND BLAND.
The aftermath of the Democracy's Chi
cago field of thistles, briars and Dumble
bees furnishes rich gleaning, especially in
appliances that were used to keep alive
the several Presidential booms. Perhaps
the most amusing of them are pictures of
Boies and Bland as farmers, which their
friends scattered everywhere. Each of
these statesmen had been photographed,
each in his shirtsleeves, with a mow
ing-machine at hand. In (he rush
and excitement of the convention
days the photographs were not so crit
ically looked upon. They were there to
do tbe Cincinnatus act and they played it
very well, but upon closer examination
just how much of a fraud of a farmer each
of these great men is is clearly revealed.
BoiÂ»sis perched upon his mowing machine
and at the first glance he looks tne well-to
do farmer, but upon closer inspection it is
found tnat his hat is about the kind Law
yer Boies wonki wear between his office
and his residence on occasions when he was
desirous of appearing a well-dressed man.
His necktie is adjusted with so much
exactness one is justified in believing that
he spent several minutes before the mirror
before starting for tbe farm. His breeches,
shoes and shirt have not that very un
fashionable cut which is peculiar to the
working clothes of the average farmer.
In fact tbe picture looks as if he might
have come to the mowing machine fresh
from his somewhat luxuriously appointed
law office.
Bland's picture represents the Missouri
farmer as standing at the bead of the
"nigh hoss," as lie would say. He has no
necktie â he never wore one in his life. He
has arranged bis hatâ a sure enouirh
farmer hatâ far back on his head so as to
show for ail it was worth tbe "massive
brow" about which his admirers had so
much to say before the Nebraska boy with
tbe gift of gab knocked him out, or rather
off his mowing machine.
Bland knew enough to attend to the de
tails of bis dress so as to "look the son of
toil." But it is very evident that no young
girl ever made more careful preparation to
have her photograph taken to send to her
best sweetheart tnan Boies and Bland dii
when they were arranging to play the
"honest farmer" racket upon the dele
gates to the Chicaeo convention.
IN OPEN REBELLION.
The revolt against the platform and
nominees of the Chicago convention has
reached the dimensions of a large-sized
rebellion. All the leading Democratic
newspapers of the East, and very many
of those in the Southern and Middle States,
are either coming out for McKinley or
urging the leaders to call another conven
tion ond put a Simon Pure Democratic
ticket in the field. Leading business men
of tbe Democratic faith stating in
newspaper interviews^hat they shall with
draw from their party and co-operate with
the Republicans so long an tho Bryans
and the Tillmans are in charge of the
Democracy's official machinery.
It is well for tho country that thinking
people do not hesitate to cat loose from
party ties when the public good demands
that they should. If it were otherwise
the country would now be confronted by
a proposition to change the basic princi
ples of the Government which would have
enough supporters as a party measure to
make the stability of the Nation a ques
tion of doubt. No party of standing ever
declared for so many radical and hurtful
changes in the business methods of the
country, and as for sectionalism, the new
Democracy oui-Herods the most radical of
tbe old pro-slavery Herods. The wonder
is that the delegates to the convention
who represented the traditions and princi
* THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 13, 1896.
pies of the party did not walk out of the
hall when they saw how completely tbe
organisation had been captured by Popu
lists, anarchists and communists, but they
are acting like patriots now by denounc
ing the whole business and advising their
friends to abandon the party.
These enormous accessions to the Re-
publican party have an element of danger,
however, which should not be lost sight
of. The feeling that Mr. McKinley will be
elected by an overwhelming majority is
lively to abate enthusiasm and cause a
great many to give up taking an active
part in the campaign, if not to the extent
of staying away from the polls on election
day. In view of what the election of
Brvan would mean, and the necessity for
crushing out all tbat sort of thing right
in the beginning of its purpose ought to
stimulate every lover of the institutions
of his country to greater effort than ever,
the more ?o now that the strongest Demo
cratic newspapers and many of tne great
leaders of the party have publicly allied
themselves with the opponents of Altgeld's
ticket. This revolt against tbe Chicago
platform and nominees should impress
every one tbat there is danger ahead that
should not only be averted, but the con
spirators driven into political obscurity.
Of course, Mr. McKinley wili be elected,
but that is not enough. In electing him
Bryan and his revolutionary isms and
fallacies must be annihilated by an
avalanche of McKinley votes.
SWELLING OF THE HEAD.
The nomination appears to have de
veiopeJ characteristics in Mr. Bryan that
his life-long friends never suspected were
any part of his make-up. According to
reports from his hotel in Chicago the next
day after his nomination he swelled out
witn an appreciation of his high mighti
ness and superexcellence to such an ex
tent that even tbe gentlemen who trav
eled all the way from Nebraska to Chi
caco at their own expense to inflate the
balloon were required to stand in the ball
and, with the formality accorded to princes
and the like, send in their card. Report
has it that not a few went away wearing a
big disgust. It is true, that when the
"friend of the common people" became
so fatigued that he threw himself upon the
bea with his boots and coat on, a few of
his old political wire-pullers and confiden
tial advisers were permitted to peep into
the room and behold greatness in repose.
But snubbing old friends when a few
hours before he was glad to have them
call him "Billy" was not the only silly
thins he did. It was very stupid of him
to respond to the messenger's announce-
ment tbat he had been nominated by dic
tuting a proclamation to the country as
suring the public that he was "opposed to
two terras," and that he should not accept
the nomination four years hence. He made
the mi.stake of thinking the nomination
on an Altgeld platform was tbe equivalent
of the majority vote of the electoral col
lege. But the greatest exposure of :he
man's estimate of his own importance
was when he suggested that tbe largest
hall in New York be hired tor the cere
mony of formally notifying him of his
nomination. Of course he had in his
mind's eye the opportnnity such a place
wouJd afford him to repeat hi 3 one speech,
but think of Cleveland or Harrison, or
Garfieid or Grant resorting to such a spec
tacular exhibition!
It was very kind but a great breach of
propriety in Mr. Bryan when he assured
Mr. bewail that he (Bryan )haa held himself
aloof from using his influence with the
convention in selecting -a candidate for
the tail of the ticket. What meaning
Mr. Bewall gathered from the information
no one but himself knows, but the words
appear to convey the idea that Bryan
wanted to inform his running-mate that
be Bhould refuse to assume any responsi
bility for the convention's work in tbe
premises. But the reaction is coming and
the edges of it have already reached the
more thoughtful. Not v few of them are
wondering how it was that they were
thrown off their feet by the glib tongue ol
a pretty Platte River boy, but it is too
late now. He is their nominee, and all
they can do to repair damages is to follow
him about the country and apologize for
the largeness of his head and littleness of
its conteuts.
A GREAT ORGANIZATION.
Whether it is true or not, as a Christian
Endeavorer puts it. "We are guided by the
hand of Providence," the f&ct remains
tbat the world gives no account of such
growth of a religious organization as the
Christian Endeavorer*. Six'een years ago
it had no existence. To-day it has more
than 40,000 local societies, its total mem
bership is above 3,000,000 and it has got a
foothold in nearly every country in the
world. It is doubtful if the Christian
cburcb made as much substantial progress
ir. a half-dozen generations as this organ
ization has in less than sixteen years. No
doubt its great strength iies in its inde
pendence of the churches â that is, it is
non-sectarian. "For Christ and the
church" is its motto, bat "church" means
a place to worship God. Infidels may
scoff at tbe purpose and efforts of the En
deavorers, but counting religion out of tbe
question, ho sensible person will deny
that this great organization of youn^
people is doing a mighty work in advanc
ing civilization to higher and better levels.

It really looka as if the San Joaquin Valley
had "struck oil" In the real old sense of the
term. The prospect now is that there will be
an oil field all the way from the Merced
County line down to the line of King's County.
The Fresno ExpotUor thus furnishes the latest
information concerning oil discoveries down
the country: "The latest discovery indicates
the presence of oil-bearing strata at an easily
penetrable depth In the vicinity of Silver
Creek, not far from the eastern foot of the Pa
noche Pass. Judge Langford of Panoche stated
that indications of oil were quite abundant
twelve miles south of Panoche and nearly out
on the plains. A company has been formed
to develop the scheme, and the four wells ex
perimentally dug have yielded evidences of
oil in abundance and of high standard. The
company, which has not yet incorporated, is
composed mainly of San Francisco capitalists,
who have been keeping things quiet as long as
possible.
"Inasmuch as the beds of tertiary strata in
the foothills near Panoche are almost identi
cal with those around Coalinea, there is noth
ing unreasonable in the supposition that the
oil-bearing strata are continuous over the in
terval between Coallnga and Panoche; In
othor words, that The western foothills of the
county may lead to sudden and startling de
velopment of capital and wealth. There are
already oil fields In working on the coast side
of tne Panoche Pass and in the vicinity of
Holllster."

It is owing largely to the splendid work of
the newspapers of Santa Clara Valley that
tne garden Â«pot of California, as it is called, is
is known far and wide and beyond the
seas for Its wonderful vegetable wealth anfl
productiveness; and first among the papers to
which Santa Clara Valley owes so much is tne
San Jose Mercury, which has done, more, per
haps, than any other agency or influence to
attract a class of settlers with brains, capital,
energy and progressive spirit to that delight
ful region. That the sterling efforts of the
Mtrcury through a quarter of a century have
net with gratifying reward U shown in the
fact that the publication stands to-day in the
front rank of interior journals, and is one of
the most progressive newspapers in California.
The Mercury ha 3 Just entered lv fiftieth vol

edited, strong, newy paper, as widely known
and as favorably regarded as the rosy valley

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"It's no country for a decent man to live in,
and a poor man has no business going there,
but I think we have a good thing down in So
nora," said Bolton Rogers yesterday as he re
clined among a lot of sofa pillows on a luxuri
ous divan in his apartments at the Baldwin.
His coat was off, and the leisurely manner in
which he puffed at a fragrant Havana empha
sized the impression that he sincerely believes
his recently acquired mining property in Mex
ico is a good thing.
Mr. Rogers was born in San Francisco, but
for the last twenty years has lived la Seattle,
where he has served in every department of
the city police force. Several years ago he was
chief of the detective bureau, and in 1891 he
became Chief of Police, a position from which
he has only recently retired, but not from old
age, for he is apparently little more than
thirty years old.
"This property of ours," resumed Mr. Rogers,
"is about seventy miles below the interna
tional line. It is a placer region, and we have
water enough In sightâ only a little stream,
bat it's a river in that region, for it runs all
the year round. Them's no hoodoo there. Men
that know nothing about mining haven't
swarmed into the place, expecting to shovel
up pay dirt most anywhere.
"We're satisfied. So far we've just been tap
ping here and there in the gravel to see what
we have. Consequently thing 3 are iv a posi
tion where ihere isn't much definite informa
tion. Mr partner is an old miner; lived in
Tombstone twenty years.
"There's a hoodoo at that place. It's this
way: You and I ami some other, fellow own
three big mines that are full of water. You
won't pump out, because that will drain the
other two mines, and I won't pump because it
will save you that much. So we Bit and none
of us will do anything."
"The outlook for raisins ia bright and much
better than it was a year ago," said Lee L.
Gray yesterday at the Occidental. Mr. Gray is
extensively interested- In the raisin industry
ai Fresno, but has come to town on business
connected with the equipment of the Fruit
growers' Warehouse Company, which he has
recently organized.
"The idea," he explained, "is to have a large
warehouse where the producers can store their
fruit, borrow money on it at 8 per cent and
wait for a decent price. The fundamental
principle is to stop consignment. Before, the
producer had to ship his crt>p at once and get
what it would bring when the consignment
reached the Easteru markets. Now this ware
house can hold the raisins and dried fruits
until the producers can get a living price for
them. The scheme han spread like wildfire
and the growers are taking hold of the iaea.
"The raisin crop is fully 40 per cent short
this year, but the outlook for prices is good.
Then that new winery that is going up near
Fresno will also shorten the raisin crop. It
will take a large part of the second crop of
muscats. That will all tend to raise prices. Bo
if the jobbers East have the 'dough' we will
get it."

CYCLING IN THE PARK,
Proposed Ordinance to Make
Wheelmen Use the Cycle
Paths.
The League of American Wheemen
Will Oppose It if It Is Made
Compulsory.
In the news about Golden Gate Park in
last Monday's Call an item appeared
stating that the Commissioners were push
ing the work upon the new cycle path and
that when completed the wheelmen would
be "required" to ride upon it. A great
many riders use the paths already con
sructed in preference to the main drives,
but from the fact that considerable scorch
ing is done on tbe paths, ladies, beginners
and the more careful gentlemen riders
have taken to the drives for the sake
of safety and comfort. It is evident
that the Park Commissioners intend
that when the cycle path is completed
the wheelmen shall use it, and not ride
upon the drives, and yet the natural in
justice of such a rule will appeal to every
one.
Frank H. Kerrigan, chief consul of the
League of American Wheelmen in Califor
nia, in response to an inquiry has for
warded the following communication to
The Call upon the subject:
The law of the bicycle and its rights on tho
road have been stated so often that it would
seem that every one should be familiar with
It, even the Commissioners of Golden Gate
Park. San Francisco. In stating it again I
take the risk of being tiresome.
Tne bicycle is defined by different lexioog
raphers to be a carriage; the same definition
has been laid down time and again by the
courts of this country and of England. The
courts have said that the bicycle is entitled to
the use of the street, the ssme as any other
vehicle; and it is entitled to equal rights with
other carriages to the use of the streets with
out discriminating restrictions. Likely the
strongest exposition of the law was laid down
in New York when it was proposed by the
Brooklyn Bridge Commissioners to exclude the
use of bicycles on the great bridge.
It was deemed necessary that such a rule
should be passed in view of the fact that there
was an immense amount of traffic and travel
passing over the briuge daily, and also in view
of the fact that the driveway* are only 16 feet
wide. The proposed ordinance by the Com
missioners was submitted to a committee of
some of the soundest lawyers in the city of
New York, and that commitioe unanimously
agreed that such a rule would be illegal ana
no restriction was ever placed upon the bicycle
as to the use of it upon that bridge, and devel
opments can be shown since that ii would have
been unwarranted to have enacted the pro
posed ordinance.
It is high time that the old prejudices against
the bicycle should subside, and in most en
lightened communities the wheelmen are glad
to say it is a thing nf the past. The bicycle Is a
new invention, and as such has built up a new
industry, created a new market for raw and
manufactured material and has led to the in
vention of many ingenious mechanical de
vices in connection with it.
Bicycles carry men to and from their places
of business; they are used for messenger ser
vice and other services; they are invaluable
for combining exercise and recreation, and
should be treated with consideration.
In 1891 or 1893 the Legislature of this State
attempted to vest the Golden Gate Park Com
missiouers with a power to enact ordinances.
That act by the Legislature is undoubtedly an
unconstitutional delegation of power, and
any ordinance passed by the Golden Gate Paris
Commissioners would be void and of no effect.
The ouly body in the City and County that
has power to pass an ordinance worthy of conÂ«
sideration by wheelmen is the Board of Super
visors, and, as I have stated, not even that
body has power to exclude the nse of the
wheel on any of the highways. Any attempted
legislation discriminating" against the rights
ot the wheelmen will be met by as strong and
persistent a resistance as this division of the
Leugue of American Wheelmen can command,
and since justice must prevail it is safe to say
that the wheelmen will not be denied the
same use of roads and highways as is accorded
other vehicles. Yours, sincerely,
Frank H. Kerrigan.
Chief Consul North California Division
League of American Wheelmen.
The matter now stands about like ihist
When the cycle path is completed the
chances are that nearly all tbe wheelmen
will use it. But if there should happen to
be a few who do not care to they should
not be deuied the right to ride where they
please upon the highways, and the League
of American Wheelmen will oppose any
legislation to that end.

THEY SOWED A
REAL WHIRLWIND.
School-Teachers May Not
Lose Their Right to
Marry.
AN INCONSISTENT RULE
The Single Ladi ,s Must Go Out,
but if Married May
Come Back,
UNJUST DISCBIMINATIONS.
Directors E* ger to Make Vacancies and
Adopt an Unconstitutional
Rule.
In the adoption of the rule requiring
lady teachers to resign from the depart
ment when they marry, the Board of Edu
cation has sown the seeds of a moral and
political whirlwind in the public schools.
A new aud striking feature about this
rule is, that while it requires the maidens
to resign it does not prohibit their imme
diate re-employment as teachers upon the
expiration of their honeymoon. It Is, ac
cordingly, as paradoxical as it is funny.
Teachers are also wondering why Director
Comte, who is an attorney, voted for tbe
enactment of a rule which he bad already
advised his associates was unconstitu
tional. Its operation during the time it
remained in force is likely to be productive
of numerous entangling situations, which
will be watched with lively interest by all
concerned.
Miss Jeannette Harper, a teacher in the
Mission Grammar Scnool, was united in
wedlock on the very evenine of the adop
tion of the objectionable Jaw. Since fehe
is now the wife of a son of Judge Wallace
it is expected that her resignation will be
voluntarily submitted at the next session
of the Board of Education. The opinion
has been freely expressed, however,. that
the resignation would be entirely at her
option, and could not be consistently de
manded under tbe rule by the school
sages.
"Within the past year," said Dr. C. A. Clin
ton, who is chairman of the qualifications
committee, "the rule relative to the mar
riaee of Our lady teachers has been
changed half a dozen times. lam fully
satisfied that the anti-marriage rule, whicii
has recently been re-enacted, is unconsti
tutional. I did not favor it, yet there is
something to be said for it as well as
against it.
"The theory is that the department is
justly entitled to the entire time of its
teachers, yet when a lady married her
horn* and family duties must necessarily
divert a share uf her time and attention
from the school and the children under
her tuition. Tbe true reason, though, for
its adoption is, I think, to rcalce vacancies
in the department to be .tilled by the
directors.
"Undoubtedly it is a discrimination be
tween the sexes as well as being hostile to
marriage, and cannot, in consequence, bs
upheld upon any moral or legal ground.
Still, while it may result in reducing the
number of roarnagea in the department,
it Is practically inoperative, because a lady
who resigns can, it she has sufficient influ
ence, re-enter the department aa a teacher
after taking a husband, for there is no law
prohibiting the employment of married
ladies. The inconsistency of it is ludic
rous, isn't it?
"There are now in the department many
most excellent teachers, married and
single. The moral power a teacher pos
sesses over her pupils would naturally be
increased by marriage. It is doubtful, of
course, if a young lady teacher would feel
inclined to take an appeal to the courts
when she married. If her husband should
be wealthy or very well-to-do she would de
sire to resign and let him support her; but,
on the contrary, there are oases where tne
man commands only a small income, and
marriage would be impracticable unless the
wife's earnings could be joined with his.
The more experienced teachers we have
tne better it is for the schools. Young
girls frequently calculate upon teaching
for a year or two to maintain themselves,
and then just as soon as they can linii
hu-bands to resign. The many changes
occurring in this way are not desirable,
and we ought to promote as far as pos
sible tbe wishes of ladies who take up
teaching as a life profession."
"I don't believe," said Director H. C.
Henderson, "in keeping any dead-letter
rules upon our booKs. What is the use of
it, anyhow? If the single ladie? teaching
in the" department wish to marry and can
?et a good chance why shouldn't they?
t's nobody's business except theirs and
their husbands'. The Board of Educa
tion can't stop them, rule or no rule, and
it is no use for them to try.
"When I first went into the department
I bad that silly anti-marriage law knocked
out. Why is it put back now? That's a
conundrum. I guess, thoutch, that some
of my worthy associates are looking for
some good places for their friends. There's
another joker about the rule besides its
unconstitutionality, and that is thai the
directors won't dare even to ask a teacher
when she marries to resign. If she is very
timid sbe may be soared into doing it
against her will, bat if she doesn't, she
will be let severely alone. You'll see that
what I'm telling you is straight, and if
some plucky young teacher ever takes
this anti-marriage rule into the courts it
will be knocked skyhigh."

Yesterday morning D. Walker, a drum
mer for Gibbs <fc Co.. landed from the
steamer Dauntless from Stockton and told
Police Sergeant Tom Maboney on the
wharf a tale of woe. Coming down the
river he feil in with two strangers, a man
and a woman, and he could not do enough
for them.
He paid for- their supper on the boat
and also most of the intoxicants they all
drank, and in doing so exhibited a well
filled purse. It is needless to say that he
was permitted to drink the most and
deepest. He somehow managed to get to
bed, and when he awoke in the morning
he found that his two companions had
plucked him. They took $130. which was
money belonging to his employers, and
this was a serious complication.
The young man was very sorrowful,
very penitent and soul he would hnve to
apply to his mother for money to make
bis deficiency good.
By the Doric, it is learned that the seal

PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANITY.
Elder Tanner of the Mormon Mission
Believes It Will Reappear.
Elder Henry 8. Tanner of the California
Mormon Mission spoke in Pythian Castle
last evening upon the "Rise and Destiny
of Christianity." He said:
"While it may appear presumptuous for
one to claim that primitive Christianity
will yet cover the earth, when we know
how loug Christianity has been estab
lished, bow many hundreds of forms it has
taken and yet how few people have been
reached, yet it is destined to cover the
earth and every knee Dow and every
tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ.
"The pure principles of primitive Chris
tianity wili be taught unto all the world
and it will no longer be said that oniy
dead forms exist; for the power and gift*
will accompany true believers and follow
ers of the lowly Nazarene."

ACMES WIN THE
BIG ROAD RACE,
Twenty-Mile Road Event of
the Associated Cycling
Clubs.
KRAFT'S GREAT RIDE
The Bay City Man Covered the
Course in Record-Breaking
Time.
YEOMAN FOULED MENNE.
Tee Bay Citys Lost When Apparently
Winnersâ Accidents Were
Numerous.
The great twenty-mile road race of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs was
ridden yesterday over the San Leandro
triangle and resulted In a victory for the
C. A. Kraft of the Bby Cfty Wheelmen. Who Covered Twenty Miles in 12 mins.
51 1-5 scC9.
team of the Acme Club Wheelmen of Oak
land, the Bay City Wheelmen of this City
being a close second.
The race was reolete with incidents and
accidents, and the ride was a hard one for
all me contestants. Th* day was warm
and soltry, and the course over which the
race was ridden was in very poor condi
tion. Falls were numerous, and, while
nothing serious happened, many a man
finished bruised and dusty â sometimes on
a borrowed wheel, his own having been
smashed in some collision or tumble.
As prophesied in The Call last Friday,
the Acmes won the rtÂ»ce and won it fairly,
but their most-feared competitor.", the
bay Citys, who entered their men at the
last moment, having almost decided not
to ride, gave them a much harder battle
than was rxpectcd, and but for the foal
riding of Yeoman of the Reliance Club,
who elbowed and threw Menne of the Bay
City.-, the latter club might have easily
won.
The trouble occurred on the south side
of the triangular course, near the railroad
crossing. The race was paced throughout
by tandem teams from the different clubs,
and at this point a Reliance team swung
into the lead. To be first behind a tandem
is some advantage, and all the men in the
group of riders sprinted for the coveted
position. Menne cot it, but this did not
suit Yeoman, who rode alongside of him
and tried to crowd him out, using his
elbow. Menne would not have it that
way and elbowed him back. It was over
ft rough bit of roAd, and Yeoman's wheel
went into a rut, throwing nim heavily and
bringing his opponent down. also. The
rest of tne bunch cleared the smastiup and
kept on, but the wheels of the two who
ha i fallen were wrecked and they could
not follow.
But happily for Yeoman a clubmate of
his came along and loaned him hid wheel,
ami lie was .soon off aeaiii anU caught up
what he had lost, while Menne had to wait
several minutes before he could get an
other mount. It was a deliberate foul,
and lost the Bay Citys the race; but they
are too sportsmanlike a club to claim it on
any such grounds, and will co no further
than to denounce Yeoman's foul riding.
Menne is a n;uch better man than Yeo
man, and would have beaten him. By
this foul he finished over four minutes b â '-
hind Yeoman. As the Bay Citys only
lost the race by one minute and
twenty-eight seconds, owing to Kraft's
wonderful ride in the second bunch,
where he gained over three minutes on
every man who started with him, it is safe
to say tliey had the race well in hand. As
President Kerrigan said, after he had
heard the particulars of the foul : "Well,
I guess Yeoman of the Reliance Club won
the race for the Acmes, but never mind.
You remember the Acmes won the first
relay race, and with one exception we
have won it ever since. Maybe this race,
which has to be contested every year,
will also turn out that way; here's
hoping."
The twentv-mlle team race is a new de
parture with the associated clubs, but will
be an annual feature hereafter. The
trophy is an elegant silver cup, hand
somely engraved. As the association
already has annual ten and twenty-rive
milo races and the hundred-mile relay, it
was decided to have a twenty-mile race, to
be competed for by five men from each
club which entered, and the lowest aver
age net time of any team would give to
that olub possession of the trophy for a
year. It has to be won three times, how
ever, to become the personal property of a
club.
ThA fact that the race was limited to
amateurs kept many good men out of it,
but wheh the association passed a rule
that no man could ride Who had ever
raced in class B of the League of American
Wheelmen (though the league last Febru
ary had restored all sucli men io ama
teurism), the big clubs lost interest in it
entirely.
The Garden City Cyclers and San Fran
cisco Road Club would not enter teams,
and tbe Bay Cilys only went in half
heartedly without much hope or care of
winning. As a matter of fact, that rule
was rushed through by the Alameda
County deiegatOÃ to the association to
keep out the ex-class B crackajacks of San
Francisco and San Jose, who had been re
turned to amateurism, for last year when
that class flourished class B men across
the bay were as scarce as silver Democrats
to-day.
The ride was started at Fitcbburg, on
the county road, about three miles tkis
side of Sari Leandro. On reaching the lat
ter point the men took the fork toward
Haywards, covering the triangular course
back to San Leandro, ei^ht and one-third
miles, hiding this twice, nnd the three
and one-third miles extension to Fitch
burg, made up the required twenty miles,
the linish being in San Leandro.
Yesterday's race was entered by five
teams, from the Acme, Bay City. Cali
fornia, Alameda, Imperial, Olympic and
Reliance cluos. At the last moment the
Olympics had to withdraw, owing to the
sudden il!nes3 of J. K. Wing, their best
man, of which they were notified too late
to ?et a man for his place.
Only four of the clubs finished the race,
the California and Santa Rosa men meet
ing witn accidents or being unable to keep
up the pace.
One man from each team, mafclns a
group of six riders, was started at 10:30
o'clock, another bnnch five minutes later,
and so on until the five bunches of six
men each were on the way, paced by tan
dems, singles or anybody or anything that
could or would make a pace fa?t enough.
Some of tho tandem teams were: Dixon
and Welch, IJay City : Johnson and Mayo,
California; E/an and Jaegling, Imperial;
Kroetz and Stanley, Olympic, and a team
from the Reliance Club.
The speed" maintained was very fast,
averaging well under three minutes for
every mile. But in the second bunch
there was one man who could not get
Dacing fast enough to suit him. This was
Kraft of the Bay City Wheelmen. He
chafed under restraint, it seemed, and
kept coming up even with the tandem
riders, who were already nearly dead from
riding so fast, and asking them to make
it faster. They only looked at him in dis
gust, wondering what manner of man he
was, and worried along for another mile.
Kraft mint have thought tney were de
laying the game, for he finally swung out,
passed the tandem, and, digging into
his pedals, left the bunch as though it
was standing still. He was soon out of
their sight, and what was his joy on turn-
Ing tho corner at San Lorenzo to see his
two club mates. George K. Dtxon and
Herbert W. Welch, waiting there with
their tandem to pace some man, they did
not care who, though a Bay City pre
ferred.
And "o all was merry from there on
with Charley Kraft, ior if there is any
team that can ncorch the protind with
their speed it is Dixon and Welch. And
so it was that the *p' ctators at the finish
saw whizzing past them what appeared to
be Uiree men on a triplet dressed in pretty
pink racing suits mid wearing the emblem
of the Maltese croÂ»*Â». but which was in
rerun v the Dixon- Welch tandem team
and Kraft on a single, but trailing thorn
closely it looked like one tbree-se&ted
machine.
'â¢Was that pace hot enonen for you*"
queried jolly Lieutenant Dixon after the
race, to Kraft, wno wos mill on hin wheel,
moving nlowly and breathing heavily.
'â¢Don't ask" me," responded the thor
ouehly winded German. "Wait till I ride
another mile and get my breath."
Kraft's ride is most remarkable and es
tablishes a very low twenty-mile record
for the coast. His net time for the dis
tance was 52 mm. 51 1-5 sec. This has
only been beaten in two States in tbe
Unionâ Massachusetts 48:68 and Texas
50:08 â neither of which was made in com
petition aÂ»hiÂ» was, and surely over better
courses, for the San Leandro triangle road
is now very rough and heavy.
Williamson of Santa Rosa mad* a splen
did ride in tho fourth group. He beat
them ail in and rode faster than the av
erage time of the day by a couple of min
utes. Bates of the Reliance Club rode
splendidly in the third bunch, had a fall
or two and still finished well to the front.
Vincent of the Bay Cities eh ar.ged his
mount five times in the race and still fin
ished well up. Staples, the last Acme
man to finish, fell six times' all told, and
changed wheels whenever he saw one he
thought looked better than the last one he
borrowed, like a Kentucky hortetrader.
The following show the perform
ances of the men on the teams which
finished the race:

56:48 3-3; H. W. Squires, 5B:Â»4 4-5; K. \V.

A match race may come out of yester
day's race between Squires of the" Acme
Club and Kraft of the Bay Cities. The
Aomes think their man can beat Kraft's
time for twenty miles; the Bay Cities
think differently. Such differences of
opinion often make races.

Tennessee International Exhibi

Addie L. Ballcu and Elizabeth Sloper
Looking After California's
Interests.
The lady writers of the State are simply
bubbling over with enthusiasm. Manu
scripts are being collated, typewritten and
neatly bound together with delicate rib
bons. Books are being sent in with every
mail. And the cause of it all is the chance
given them to exhibit their talent at the
Tennessee Centennial and International
Exposition.
It came about in this way. The literary
committee of the exposition decided that
it would be a good plan to appoint ladies
of ability in all the different States of the
Union to collect the published works and
miscellaneous articles of the various fe
male authors of their respectives States.
Mrs. Addie L. Ballou was honored with a
selection for California, and immediately
appointed Mrs. Elizabeth Sloper her assist
ant.
As soon as convenient they notified all
the California women of known ability as
writers of what was desired. The result
was most promising. Manuscripts and
books, accompanied with missives express
ing appreciation and a sincere desire to see
our lady writers make a grand display,
have been arriving with every mail.
Among them is a new work by Flora
McDonald Shearer, entitled, "The Legend
of Aulus." The book also contains severa 1
other shorter poems of merit.
Two pamphlets by Rose O'Halloran, on
the subject of astronomy, are also deserv
ing of mention. One is entitled, "Tele
scopic Study of ihe Heavens," and the
other, "When the Moon Runs Highest
and Runs Lowest."
Then there are two books by Mary Lam
bert, which will receive their due share of
attention. "La Rabida," a Californlnn
Columbian souvenir poem, iÂ» a perfect
gem so far as printing and binding are con
cerned, and is also beautifully illustrated.
A larger work, iresh from the press, con
tains exactly 200 pages, with a steel en
graving of the author.
Another work that cannot fail to excite
attention even amonc the vast exhibit
that will be made is Marie L. FarrinÃton's
'Facinjr the Fphinx." Aside from its
unique title, the book deals in an orignial
manner with tht esoteric study of symbol
ism in the religions of Greece, Rome,
Egypt and the Orient.
From many others have come promises
to send In their writings at once. Among
them is Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who has
promised two books fromeher facile pen.
Miss Josephine McCracken of Wrights,
Santa Clara County, will mail her "Over
land Tales" and "Another Juanita."
Mrs. Charles Brown has promised the
works of her mother, Mrs. Georglana
Kirby.
Agnes Mannine, Madge Morris Wagner,
Ina D. Coolbrith Gertrude Atherton
and other distinguished writers have been
communicated with, but sufficient time
for an answer has not yet elapsed.
Mrs. Mary A. Stanton has given her
word to contribute a work on physiognomy.
Mrs. Julia Schlesinger has donated. her

. ORDAINED BY BISHOP MANOGUE
His Theological Studies Were Made
at Beniciaâ Was Born in
Nevada.
Rev. J. 8. Jones, O. P., who for the
past four years has been assistant in the
church at Vallejo, was recently transferred
to St. Dominic's of this City, where he will
Rev. J. S. Jones. O. P., Recently of Vallejo, Who Has Been Transferred to St.
Dominic's of This City.
officiate a8 first assistant to the Very Rev.
Father Murphy, pastor of St. Dominic's
and superior of the Dominican order on
this coast.
Father Jones ia a young man of high
abilities, and possesses those qualities
that endear him to the hearts of all with
whom he comes in contact.
He was born in Nevada. His theological
studies were made at Beniciaand he was
ordained into the priesthood in this City
in 1888 by the Jate Bishop Manogue, who
officiated in the absence of Archbishop
Riordan.
Fatner Doogan was appointed pastor of
Vallejo by Archbishop Riordan on the
death of Father Denis, June 17.
Father Denis became very ill during the
latter part of last May, and Father Jones,
who was then assisting at St. Dominic's,
was sent to Vallejo again to tide over mat
ters, pending the illness of Father Denis.
The vacancy made by the changing of
FaÂ»her Dpo.-an at St. Dominic's was filled
by the Very Rev. Father Murphy. The
fact of Fatner Murphy's highj)osition in
the Dominican Order makes the office of a
chief assistant to him equally high, as
during the absence of the superior Father
Jones will be called upon to take his
place and conduct the services as a virtual
pastor, besides performing the duties of
the snperior's assistant.
Fflther Jones is the spiritual director of
the Young Men's Holy Name Society of
St. Dominies Church and he is extremely
popular among the young men members
of this society. He is a man of tall and
imposing presence and possesses a rich,
full and pleasantly modulated voice. His
sermons are noted for their force and
rhetorical beauty, as well as for their
persuasiveness in lifting the heart to bet
ter things.
GREAT GAME OF HANDBALL
Har.ow, the Ex-Coast Champion,
Defeats the Overhand
Swiper.
An Exciting and Closely Contested
Match Payed at 'he Union
Court.
Handball enthusiasts crowded the San
Francisco court yesterday afternoon, the '
attraction being the match fora purse of I
$V) between J. Harlow, the ex-coast cham
pion, and R. Leniban, the famous over
hand swiper and crackajack of the Union
court.
Both had trained well for the contest i
and each had his admirers. Lenihan is j
not such an old hand at the game as Har- I
low, but he had been distinguishing him
self recently by lowering the colors of
some of the leading amateurs. The match, j
therefore, was looked forward to with
more than usual interest.
J. C. Nealon, the veteran player, was
selected as judge and scorer, and he per
formed his delicate duties with judgment
and impartiality.
Lenihan started the ball going and
pleased his admirers by running up a j
score of 18 before being retired. Hariow
succeeded in making four aces, aud then
Lenihan ran out. The second game was
wot) by Harlow by a score of 21 to 12.
The third game was one of the prettiest
seen in tne court and created the greatest
excitement. Harlow started off with 18
consecutive aces and it looted as if it was
ail up wita Lenihan. There was some
close play till the score stood Harlow 19,
Leniban 5. Then Lenihan began to toss
in fine style and ran his score to 19 amid
great applause. It was thought that he '
Mwould run out, but he pot nervous and
â gave an easy ball to Harlow. Harlow
â failed to score, which added to the excite
â merit, and- Lenihan Â£ made { another ace.
lie only wanted another to win the game,
but Harlow was on the alert and ." cleverly
â caught a scorcher, gaining the toss. He
â made the two aces to win and the score
â stood: Harlow two /ramps, Lenihan one.
Harlow ' then tossed a " great game and
made 21 consecutive aces without giving
HLenihan the ghost of a chance. He was
â warmly congratulated on. his victory and
Lenihan, who played a plucky game,
â came in for a full share of applause.. .
At the Union court there â¢ were ' several
â closely contested games. - Among them
was a six-handed game, the players being
xv - Lowenberg, S. Shielder and J. Devitt
against j. W. Riley, W. P. Riley and G.
McNulty. The latter team were all heavy
â weights* and that may have been the rea
son why their more agile opponents de-
Ifeated them. It was a great game and will
Hbe long remembered by those who saw it.
Another exciting game at the Union was
â between M. J. Dillon and. Terry McManus
and J. J. Feeney and J. Nelson. It was
closely contested from start to linish and
the final was won by Feeney and Nelson
by only two aces. -

BELIEVES IN STRIKES,
Rev. W. R. Goodwin Says La
borers Should Hod
Together.
A Sermon on tbe Relations Existing
Between Employers and
Emp oyes
âââââ
Rev. Dr. W. R. Goodwin of the Califor
nia-street Methodist Church discoursed on
"Capital and Labor" to his congregation
at the evening service yesterday, taking
the Golden Rule as the theme of his text,
"if the golden rule prevailed as it
should," said he, "it would not only regu
late all differences between nations but
between contending elements at home.
"It is said the churches do not invite
the poor to enter. This cannot be sub
etantiated. Take this church, for exam
ple. It is neat, well finished, well seated,
I well lighted, has fine music and the ser
[ mons are plain and easily understood and
short. So there must be other causes,
some evil influence on the outside that has
poisoned the people's mind against going
to church.
"It is said that the churches are opposed
to labor. This is not so. The churches
are friendly to the laboring class just as
much as they are to the moneyed people.
The poorest man in the land can have
just as good a seat in this church as the
j President ol the United States.
"There must of necessity be two classes
of people in the commonwealth â the em
ployer and the employe. Now the ques
tion is how to bring those two parties to
gether.
"Tne laborer must deal fairly with his
employer; he must give value for the
money he receives. No employer will
j hire a useless or inexperienced man, nor
will he hire an intemperate man at the
same late of wages that he will pay a
sober, competent workman. He knows
of no law that will make him hire an in
; competent, physician, and the same rights
' are extended to the manufacturer. He
has a right to look into the morals of the
j men whom he gets to work for him.
'â¢Again, the laborer has rights, and the
employer should respect those rights.
Wages should be paid weekly instead of
1 monthly. The monthly pay deprives the
j laborer of the interest of his'earnings.
"Six days in tne week is all that any
man should be compelled to work. In
Canada there is no work on Sunday, no
trains are run, and in London there are no
Sunday newspapers.
"Strikes are legitimate, but the trouble
with strikes is they are badly managed.
"When there is a grievance between the
, employer and the employe every laboring
! man in a union should strike all over the
j United States, and in this manner work
would of necessity stop. Then the trouble
should be settled by arbitration. Capital
ists stick together, why should not laborers
follow the example?"
The speaker did not approve of Mr.
Rockefeller's zenero>Â«ity in giving $1,000,000
to a university and the next day adding 12
cents a gallon on coal oiJ. This, he said,
snould be prohibited by legislation on the
same principle as it regulates fares aud
' freights on railroads.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JTTLIT 13, lsue.
PITCHER KELLY'S
SPLENDID WORK,
It Helped the Imperials Beat
the Pacific Ball
Team.
BASE HITS IN BUNDLES.
Shortstop Monahan and Pitcher
McCarthy Played Very
Poorly.
CALIFORNIA LEAGUE GAME.
The San Franciscos Had Little Diffi-
culty in Beating the San
Joses.
How have the mighty fallen 1 The
Pacifies, heralded by Manager Rogers as
the best team in the City League, posses
sors of the best shortstop, the crack brst
baseman, the top-notch pitcher and the
heaviest batters of the league, have been
forced to play second fiddle to the make
shift Imperials. Think of it, the Im
perials, who never play a game without
having to put in one or two players of
some other team to complete their nine.
The Californias can beat the Imperials, at
least they have done so twice, and the Pacif
ies have never failed to beat the Californias,
but when the Pacifies and Imperials hook
up victory usually perches on the iatter's
banner. Yesterday was one of the usual
occasions and Manager Rogers' men were
outplayed from start to finish.
The prime cause of the downfall of the
Pacifies yesterday was probably the fact
that Shortstop JJonaban and Pitcher Mc-
Carthy had an off day.
Monahan, who is probably the best all
round player, and certainly the best short
fielder in California, piled up no less than
five costly errors. The field yesterday was
very bard and the ball bounded most
erratically, but most of his mistakes were
inexcusable. McCartny's work in the box
was excellent during the first three
innings, but after that he weakened per
ceptibly, and at critical periods tne heavy
hitters of tne Imperials found the ball
with little difficulty.
Of the victorious team Pitcher Kelly
easily carried off t lie honors. Only once
were the Pacifies able to bunch their hits.
That was in the third inning, when singles
by Becker, Muller and McDermott, Mona
han s base for being hit by a pitched ball
and Crowley's error netted three runs.
Kelly also made four runs out of five times
at bat.
He hit safely twice, once for two bases.
Not to be outdone by the other half of the
battery. Catcher Green burnished up his
batting eye and landed safely on the pig
skin four times out of live attempts.
Crowley made three safe hits and Neaion,
Bliss and Creamer two each.
As already related, the Pacifies made
three runs in the last half of the third in
ning. The : Imperials immediately went
them one belter. In the first part of the
fourth Bliss rapped out a . triple after.
Xealon bad been retired. Green followed
with a single, scoring Bliss. Creamer got
his base on balls. Kelly then hit safely
and Green crossed the plate, Kelly going
to second during an attempt to head off
j Green. Crowley hit the ball squarely on
i the nose and , sent a pretty two-bagger, to
; right . field, scoring both Creamer and
Kelly. The next two men were retired,
leaving Crowley on second.
Bliss' triple was in the nature of a
scratch, It looked to be an easy chance
for Monahan, but when the ball was al
most at his feet it suddenly bounded away
over the shortstop's head.
After the fourth inning it was easy for
the Imperials. Nealon scored in the fifth
on two errors, - making what was practi
cally a home run. He sent a long fly to
left center, which Muller dropped. Nealon
was almost to second base when the error
â was made and he kept running. Aluller
fielded the ball, to Monahan, who threw
wild to third, and Nealon tore by at top
speed, reaching home before McDermott
recovered the ball. ..
In the sixth McCarthy weakened. Kelly
got a base on an error by McDermott, and
Crowley, Barnett and Nealon hit safely,
scoring three runs.: Again in the seventh
the Imperial? bunched three hits, which,
coupled with another' misplay on McDer
mott's allowed four runs to be scored.
The Pacifies got ; a man around in the
eighth and another in the ninth, but the
Imperials offset this by also scoring two in
the final inning.

A Good Score In Favor of Oak
land.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 12.â Oakland
won the baseball Â«atne to-day. But for
the third inning the score would have
Deen small. In this inning Stockton
piled np nve runs and Oakland four. Both
nines seemed to go to pieces. They made
erratic throws, and the pitchers became
so demoralized that all the batsmen were
able to connect with tue ball. They lined
it out in all directions, and usually put it
just out of the reach of the fielders. This
was the only inning in which woolly ball
was played. There was some star work
done during the game. The batteries
were De Costa and Face for Stockton and
Russell and Davis for Oakland. Pace did
pome great work behind the bat, anu han
dled the stick better than any man in the
game. He lined out a two-bagger and a
home run, aud did great work throughout
the game.
Len Stockwell of Stockton made a star
running catch in the seventh. It was a
hard drive to center, and went sailing over
second. Stockwell made a ran and caught
the ball on a dive, keeping his right with
the ball weil in tbe air while he slid about
twenty feet. The crowd cheered.
Stewart of Stockton made a tnree-bagger
and Lochhead sent one out over the lelt
fielder for two bases. Stockton lost the
game throuerh the pitching of De Costa,

The house has been empty for several

miud that the trunks might contain the
plunder of burglars. The door in the rear
was opened, and, after examining the ex
terior of the trunks and the bundle, he
rang for the patrol wagon and had them

Light wind and atmosphere at the Shell
Mound rifle range was all that the marks
men could desire yesterday. Consequently
many good scores were made, and at dusk
all returned to their homes tired but; well
pleased with their day's sport. The ma
jority were the fine rifle-shooters, but few
military marksmen being present, as the
First Regiment is out on its summer en
campment.
The Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club
held its regular monthly medal shoot, and
there was a keen contest for flags (ones),
as several special prizes were up for the
most centers made during the past six
months. In the beginning of the year
merchandise and cash prizes were offered
to the marksman in each class making the
most inch centers on the Columbia target
during that period. Yesterday closed the
Bcores for these trophies, and the follow
ing are the winners:
Rifleâ Champion class, F. 0. Young; first
class, H. Heilberg; stcond class, G. Barley.
Pistolâ Champion class, J. E. Gorman; first
Class, A. B. Dorrell; second class, G. Barley
These prizes will be distributed at the next
meeting of the club, on August 7.
During the past two months there has
been an increase in the interest in 22-cali
ber rifle shooting, and several fine guns of
this style have recently appeared on the
short range. Jacobson, Carr and Hovey
are in the lead in these contests. A short
time ago Jacobson beat Carr in a fifty
shot event, and since then arrangements
have been made for a return match, which
will take place in the near future.
A free-for-all special match is also in the
wind. William Glindemann has offered
a special medal to be shot for by the lady
relatives of the members of the club, and
it is expected that the contest will be ani
mated and interesting. It is probable that
the highest score in twenty shots will take
the trophy.
At the fast meeting of the club a special
trophy and cash prizes were offered for
, heavy revolvers, six-shot scores, open to
I all comers.
Invitations are extended to the police
of Oakland and San Francisco and to the
cavalry to enter the lists. Any revolver
can be used except the 22 and the 32-44

of a prominent accident insurance com
pany the other day and wanted to be in
sured.
"Are you engaged in any hazardous
business?" asked the secretary.
"Not in the least," replied the applicant.
"Does your business make it necessary
to be without sleep at night?"
"No, sir."
"Would your business ever require you
to be where there were excited crowds â
for instance, at a riot or a tire? 1 '
"Never, sir."
"Is your business such as to render you
liable to injury from carriages or runaway
horses?"
"Oh, no, sir!"
"Does your business throw you in con
tact with the criminal classes?"
"Good gracious! No, sir."
"I think you are eligible. What is your
business?'

Almost One-Half of the People That Are Born Into
This World Have Lost This Birthright Through
the Errors of Parents or Ancestors.
HOW TO REMEDY THE WRONG
Through the transgressions and disre- |
gard of the physical laws which govern j
the human system one-half of the people
born into the world commence their exist-
ence hereditary wrecks, with feeble con-
stitutions, and a lack of that vitality
which is necessary to make life a success.
This class of sufferers are not responsible
for b'Mng born in this deplorable condition,
but they are simply paying the penalties
for the errors coamiU' I by parents or an-
cestors against our physical laws. While
they are not to blame for the condition in
which they come into the world, yet if
they neglect to remedy the wrong "when
the meaps of relief is within their reach
then they are not only responsible for
their own woakness but for the untold
misery and suffering of their posterity.
The other half of the people who are
born into the world come into it with per-
fect health and this greatest of all bless-
ings they retain just as lone as they obey
the laws of nature. Disease to them is a
violation of these laws and nearly all are I
transcressorB. For such trans ressions
we receive our punishment, and tne '
amount of pnnish-

raent we have to
suffer is in exact
proportion to our %
abuses of the laws
of health. When
disease first begins to
make itself manifest
by aches, pains, ner-
vousness or a dis-
ordered con lition of
one or more of the
essential organs of
tbe body, it is a
warning to ns that
we have violated
some of tbe physical
lawa, and also a call
from nature for
help. If the sum-
mons is promptly
answered and the
proper assistance
employed, health
and happiness are
again restored. But

during favorable weath<r the bids were
telegraphed to Washington and a reply
has since been received by wire from the

papers have been duly exacuted and work

Two companies of the First Infantry
from Angel Island will cune over to the
Presidio to-day and occtpy the tented
field near the eastern line of the reserva
tion, just north of the Uiion-street car
tracks. The infantrymen \iill be at target
practice during the week. The report in
army circles thai the infantry companies
now garrisoned on the island will soon be
stationed on themain land is regarded as
authentic.
Captain W. E. Dougherty, 1. 8. A., In
dian Agent at the Haupa Va\ley Agency,
Humboldt County, arrived W the City
last Saturday en route to Yellowstone
Park with his wife. Captain Dougherty's
success in governing Indians has been rec
ognized in many ways by tbe Var Depart
ment. He possesses in a remirKable de
gree the special ability required to man
age Indians, and at the same time to in
struct them in the duties and obligations
of citizenship. He has had many years'
1 experience with the tribes of tin Klamath
! River. It is hardly an exaggeration to say
that he knows every man, woman and
child of the Haupa Agency. He gave
names tc all tbe Indiani of the agency,
who had been formerly designated ac
cording to the aboriginal custom by some
peculiar trait or defect.
In bestowing names to youngsters of the
male sex he \ aye freely oi he most dis
tinguished army and navy names in Amer
ican history. Many of 'the Indian girls
were given the Christian naaes of society
belles. Many of the Indians have ac
quired property, and some have saved
money and deposited it in baric at Eureka.
Captain Dougherty is now firm in tlia
belief that the Indians of ihis agency
should no longer remain wirds of the
United States. He believes tiiat they are
capable of self-government un4Â»r the laws
of California. He resolved a year ago to
try the experiment, and the cbinge trom
military fo civil control is nowii progress.
The schools of the agency hwe taught
the Indiana to read, write and cioher. The
generation now assuming the duties of
citizenship is equipped as far as education
goes to carry on local government under
the general laws of California. The old
Indians of the generation passtig away
are conservative and thoughtful. They
pnderstand that the new order d things
is best for their children â that tbe family
relation as recognized by society is su
perior to the Indian tribal custom. In
due course of time elections wil! be held
for township officers and school trustees,
and the Indians elected to office T : .ll man
age public affairs in their respe<tive sub
divisions of the county.
Captain Dougherty is not anxious to
make the transition too rapidly kom one
form of government to another. The pro
cess of change, in his judgment, should be
gradual.
if neglected . or improper methods are
sought the trouble invariably â  goes from
bad to worse, until some lingering disease
Becomes established in the system, which
may journey along with the suffer all
through life. It is an old and true saying
that "a stitch .in. time saves nine," and
this is an llent adage for sick people
to heed. When one discover! that they

WAVE FOREVER,"
Rev. Ray Palmer Makes
a Stirring Address at
Metropolitan Hall.
TWO IDEAS OF LIBERTY.
The Speaker Contrasts the At
titudes of the Catholic and
the Protestant Churches.
WILL RALLY BOUND OLD QLOEY
Prediction That S ctional Differences
Will Aways Stop Short of
Dsserting the Flag.
Kay Palmer, who has recently returned
from Portland, where he has been engaged
as pastor of one of the Baptist churches,
addressed the Good Citizenship meeting
yesterday afternoon. His subject was
"Our Flag Shall Wave Forever."
The speaker prelaced his remarks by a
brief reference to his father, who had re
cently died, and who taught him among
his first lessons to lore the flag. "The old
flag that we love," be said, "to-day speaks
to the Old World. Our forefathers said in
times past, 'We will climb the mountain
republic" They accomplished the feat,
and now, standing upon the summit of
this beautiful mountain, that flag says to
other nations -of the world, 'Follow on.
Climb the mountain republic.' Had the
Son of God not proclaimed the golden rule
on this earth that old flag never would
have been created. That flag which floats
above us to-day is a flag of experiences.
It has stood the hail of shot and shell; it
has been bathed in the tears of wives and
sisters, and it has been baptized in the
biood of fathers and sons.
"I am glad to think to-day that the flag
has thousands of friends in this country.
All Protestant denominations are friends
of that flag, yet I wouldn't be willing to
hand that flag over io the Baptists, of
which denomination I am a member, be
cause I fear human nature. I would not
be willing to unite cnurch and state with
any denomination for fear they would
trample liberty under foot, as has been
done by Rome whenever it ha 3 obtained
sway.
"I do not mean to say that all Catholics
in this country are enemies of the flag. I
believe there are a great rnanv Catholics
in this country almost ready to break
away from tbe shackles which bind them.
1 have no feeling against the great mass of
Catholics. There is a fundamental differ
ence between the attitude of the Protestant
and of the Catholic on the subject of lib
erty of conscience. The Protestants say,
'Let every man worship Uod according to
Ms conscience.' The Catholics say, 'Let
every man worship God according to a
right conscience.' That meana worship
God according to the Roman Catholic
hierarchy.
"That flag is the flag of the whole land,
â¢nd all The- i/come of tlie land have that
Hag. I don't believe the time will ever
come again when the North and the
South or the East and the West will di
vide over that flag. Whatever divisions
may come the people will always rally
about the old flag and be one in its defense.
That flag stands for the sovereignty of
man. It teaches nations that in this
country every man is king and every
woman is queen. It is bound to protect
the homes of this country. It stands for
the little red ocnoolhouse. It stands for
religious liberty. It is frequently thrown
in our faces taat we are bonded together
to persecute Catholics on account of their
religion. This is untrue. If I thought
that this organization wag banded to
gether to persecute anything I would
leave this platform, never to speak of
these things again.
"This flag stand* for equality to women
as well as men. Let me say to yon that so
lone as half the citizens of this land are
deprived of their right of representation
this country never will have a government
of the people, by the people and for the
people. Oh, flag of glory, wave on. for
tuou hast not fulfilled thy mission until
woman has attained her independence and
virtue shail haTe its full reward.
"I know not what the A. P. A. as an or
ganization may, think, but as an indi
vidual I say that the nag should protect
both gold and silver upon our shores.
"Shall this old flag that waves above us
ever divide its honor with others? Shall
it float by the side of the green flag of the
Emerald Isle, or with the flae of France
or of Italy ? JÂ»*o 1 Being the flag ol liberty
it is incompatible with any ensign thrown
to the breeze by tyranny. Or shall it ever
float side by side with the flag of ecclesias
tical power? Shall it ever be said atone
breath, 'Hail to the flag of America and
hail to the papai rag'? Never while the
biood of patriots flows in the veins of
American citizens. The American people
as they look upon that flag wil say with
Napoleon's drummer boy, 'I cannot play
a retreat, I never learned how.' I want
every man here to-day to pledge his loy
alty to the dear old flag."
The speaker then called upon every one
who loved the flag to rise and repeat after
him a pledge of fealty to it and the coun
try. All present complied amid cheers
and applause.
Chairman Quitzow announced that it
was a little premature yet to announce
what political action the "order would take.
"We will be guided by intelligence, and
will take the course that will redound to
the good of the greatest number," he
said.
Rev. Ray Palmer will occupy the plat
form for the next two Sunday afternoons.
TAILORS TO ORGANIZE,
Enthusiastic Mass-Meeting Held
Yesterday to Discuss Ways
and Means.
Shorter Hours and Increased Pay Is
the Battle Cry of the Uncrgan
izod.
A mass-meeting of the garment-workera
of San Francisco was held at 927 Mission
street yesterday afternoon for the purpose
of perfecting an organization with a view
of increasing the wages and lessening the
boars of work. While the number pres
ent was somewhat disappointing the en
thusiasm was ail that could be desired.
The meeting opened by selecting 11. L.
Knox chairman and W. Feeney secretary.
Chairman Knox briefly outlined what it
was hoped would be accomplished. "The
garment-makers need to come together,"
he said, "or our condition will grow worse
with each succeeding year. It is only
through organized labor that our rights
can be preserved." Half a dozen speakers
followed, the burden oi their remarks
being alone the lines laid down by the
chairman.
H. L. Parsons said : "The price of your
labor is being gradually cut down. The
only remedy In the world is organization.
If the tailors are dissatisfied you must
come together and find out the trouble. If
you had rather go off picnicking, then
the dissatisfaction is not very pressing.
But if you are willing to come together it
shows there is something the matter. It
is a rocky road we have to travel. There
are no carriages and the path is not
strewn with flowers. Discuss the matter
among you. Is he or she willing to see
wages cut and hours lengthened? Think
of it; talk about it, and if dissatisfipd with
your condition organize. Adopt a price
list, bo that Toic will not cut Dick and
Dick will not cut Tom."
Mr. Hawksâ The History of nations
shows organization. You need itâ all
laborers need it. There should be an
eleventh commandment reading, "Thou
sbalt not take thy neighbor's job."
Henry Stribacnâ Tailoring 1a not fit to
work at now because it is underpaid. The
only way to overcome this is to organize
skilled labor. We do not want any bosses.
Even the Chinese in this City will not
work for the wages paid the white men.
McArthur â The attendance is large
enough to authorize garment-workers to
go ahead with a good heart. The history
of all unions is small beginnings and
large achievements. So there may be no
fear on the part of tUe garment-workers
on account of the small attendance. We
are here to organize a unionâ lo improve
our condition. Before we can do this we
must settle definitely in oc.r minds what
are our conditions. 1 venture you are nof
satisfied. You want shorter hours and
greater pay. To accomplish this you 1
must organize a garment-workers' union.
At the conclusion of the speech-making
it was the sense of the meeting that an
other call be issued before any active steps
were taken in the direction of organiza
tion. It is probable, therefore, that an
other meeting will be held next Sunday,

RELIGION AND POLITICS,
Dr. Williams Pays His Respects
to the Recent National
Conventions.
Bolting Politicians Are Given a Hard
Rap in a Quiet, Digni
fied Way.
"An Illustrious Beginning of a Great
Campaign" was the subject of Rev. Dr.
Williams' discourse at Plymouth Church
last night. Amon^ other things he said:
"America is full of men who do not
know what to do with a dollar except to
use it to get another dollar. They have no
conception that wealth is a trust. This
State is by no means the only State that
has increased in wealth. At least six other
States have surpassed us in amassing
riches. In twenty-five years the wealth
of the Nation has increased from fourteen
thousand millions to forty-four thousand
millions.
"Drawing a line from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, or rather from Jamestown to San
Diego, the increase has been mostly north j
of that line. Intersecting that line by
another from north to south, through
Omaha, and the increase has been east of
that line, with the exception of California.
This affords, in part, an interpretation of
the signiticant scenes and events of the
past wÂ«ek. When improved machinery ;
displaces 10 per cent of the workingnien i
it enriches those who employ them, and
creates natural friction in industrial cir- {
cles. Wealthy citizens ought not to aban- I
don the ship of state to crew and passen- j
gers when she enters the rapids.
"When the regiment is in peril no brave |
commander should leave the field. Many j
of our disasters are the result of scheming, !
but when the schemer is found out he is j
liKe a dog in church whom everybody |
kicks. When the hypocrite in political I
convention is discovered, he is like a j
barrel of powder whom nobody wants for i
a neighbor.
"Nationality and religion are insepar
able. If the Jew was God's own mating,
and ii. required centuries of divine labor
for the task, vhen this Nation, from j
Plymouth Rock to Golden Gate, from Vir
gin a to Alaska, is the result o: the same j
divine hand.
"Every nation that earth has seen has
had its keynote. That of Rome was civic
power; of Greece, culture; of India, re
ligion ; of America â some would say gold.
But how came the gold in the hills of Cal
ifornia, and the coal measures in Pennsyl
vania, and the forests in Michigan and
Wisconsin? God created all these things
and laid them up /or all the people, and
has solemnly inscribed over all, 'The earth
is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.'
"The whole civilized world divides soci
ety into thtee horizontal sections â upper,
middle, lower. God divides the world by
a vertical line â upon tuis side the right,
upon that tne wrong.
"By reason of dividing this people by
horizontal sections we are now entering
upon what is at once a most illustrious and
solemnly serious campaign. We are all
brothersâ Cains or Abelsâ -advancing the
welfare of others or destroying their hopes.
Lazarus t c vulgar may become the Laza
rus of despair through the inhumanity of
man to his fellow. Human life is short;
God's work is complex and continuous.
We should show the design of his will lo
the voice of tbe people.' 1
PARALYZED WITH DRINK,
Disgraceful Sight Witnessed on
Fourth Street Yesterday
Afternoon.
Willie Boyle, Twelve Years of Age,
Was Stupidly Drank and Was
Taken to the Hospital.
A disgraretul sight was witnessed on
Fourth Btreet, near Brannan, between 4
and 5 o'clock, yesterday afternoon.
Two boys were leadine another boy
home who was stupidly drunk. Police
man Mitchell saw the trio, and thought at
first they were playing "policeman." rie
watched them and saw thai the boy in the
center had a peculiarly vacant look in his
face. He walked toward them, and the
two boys released their hold of the other
and ran. As soon as they released their
bold the boy dropped to the sidewalk.
Mitchell recounizcd the boy as Willie
Boyle. 12 years of age, whose parents live
on Welsh street, between Fourth and
Fifth. He tried to rouse him, but failed.
He then smelied his breath, and there was
an unmistakable odor of liquor.
Mitchell decided not to take any chances
and rang for the patrol wagon and accom
panied the boy to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Thompson confirmed Mitchell's sus
picions and the usual remedies were ad
ministered. The drunken boy remained
unconscious and was in every sense of the
teem "dead to the world." He was put to
bed, and when he regains consciousness
the police will endeavor to find from him
where he got the liquor that made him so
drunk.
Policeman Mitchell will in the mean
time make inquiry among the saloons in the
neighborhood, and if the saloon-keeper is
known he will be promptly arrested for
selling liquor to a minor.

ara Falls, built 1855, is to be superseded

on the swill of the North Beach distiller
ies. But time has worked wonderful
changes not only in conformation of the
country, but also in its people.
Until the last ten years this locality was
known as "Cow Hollow," and two or three
polling precincts were suQcient to accom
modate the few Democratic residents who
resided down there.
While this territory was partly in the
Twelfth Ward no candidate ever thought
it worth his while to risk his neck and a
few dollars in search of votes.
Now, however, the place is peopled with
steady, conservative voters, a large per
centage of whom are young men. It is of
these young men that the Forty-first Dis
trict Republican Club is composed.
The principal leader, however, of this
section is that oid Republican. E. J. Wilk
inson, whose political education was ac
quired in Pennsylvania. This leader of
young men was one of the first substantial
residents who settled on the shoreline of
"Distillery" Valley and sowed the seed of
Republicanism on tne sandhills of that
bleak spot.
To him the youthful men looked, and
when they arrived at man's age it was no
difficult matter to assist them in the
organization of well conducted Republican
clubs, such as the one now in full cam
paign working order at Tilton's Hall, on
Union street.
This club is known as the Ynung Men's
Republican Club of the Forty-first Assem
bly District.
The club will have a uniform corps for
parade purposes, and as an incentive to all
young men in the district to atliiiaie with
the organization. It has a membership of
300, with a prospect of twice this number
before the first of next month. At the last
meeting held it was unanimously agreed
that tne founder of the club and the lead
ing spirit of the district, E.J.Wilkinson,
should be selected aa the additional
County Committeeman from the district.
The following are the names of the offi
cers of the club: Joseph W. Woods, presi
dent; Edward W. Btansbury, vice-presi
dent; Charles W. Wilkinson, secretary;
E. J. Wilkinson, treasurer; Thomas W.

BO WEN'S CHANCES GOOD.
He May K Â« the Next Pastor of tbe First
Swedenborgian Church.
The First Sweden borglan Church on
O'Farrell street is still without a pastor,
this office having been vacant since the
resignation of the Rev. Mr. Higgins some
two months ago.
The congregation listen to a different
clergyman almost every Sunday, but is
not in any hurry to make a final and per
manent choice of a spiritual leader.
The Rev. D. V. Bowen of Ontario,
Canada, but more recently of Southern
California, preached in tbe pulpit yester
day and made an exceedingly favorable
impression. He will preacu * there also
next Sunday. Mr. Bowen is simply visit
ing the City and was invited to occupy the
pnlpit yesterday. I* the rumors from the
circle of the church be correct regarding
the already cene-rai popularity of Mr.
Bowen, and if he should accept the pre
cipitation of this feeling in the form of a
pastorship, he will most probably ba the
future leader of that church.
BECKER AND CREGAN.
Captain Lees in Receipt of Many Con
gratulations Upon Their Con
viction.
The conviction of Becker and Cregan for
the forgery last December on the Nevada
Bank has given great satisfaction to the
heads of the Police Department, and Cap
tain Lees, who, with the able assistance of
Detective Seymour, worked up the case,
has been in receipt of many cougratuia
tions.
Captain Lees Saturday night received a
dispatch from William A. Pmkerton
of Chicago as follows: "A great vic
tory has been achieved in the conviction
of the mo?t dangerous pair of professional
criminals in this world. Accept my con
gratulations." He also received the fol
lowing dispatch from Robert A. Pinker
ton, Sheepshead Bay : "Accept my sin
cere congratulations on tbe conviction of
the greatest former of the age. The banks
of tbe world owe you and the Police De
partment and Prosecuting Attorney a debt
they can never pay. It's a great victory."
Yesterday the captain received the fol
lowing dispatch from Joseph C. Hendrix,
chairman of the Executive Council of the
American Bankers' Association, New
York: ''In behalf" of the bankers of the
"United States I be* most heartily to con
gratulate you upon the conviction of the
most notorious forgers of the United
States."
Becker and Cregan will appear for sen
tence before Judge Wallace tln3 raorniu?,
but it is expected that notice of appeal to
the Supreme Court will be given by their
attorney.
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES,
How to Prevent Their Spread
Among Public School
Children.
Dr. C. A Clinton's Valuable Sanitary
Suggestionsâ Ccn ;umptive
Cases, Etc.
There is no other topic just now which
is engaging such close attention upon the
part of the authorities as the sanitary con
dition of our public schools. The Board
of Health and the Boaid of Education are
earnestly co-operating lor the preserva
tion of the health of tne pupils and
teachers, and the improvement ot the
schoolhouses.
A change was recently made by the
Board of Education in the rule concern
ing contagious diseases. lt/sras generally
misunderstood by both parents and
teachers, and will be revised at the next
session of the directors. '.
"The drinking-cups and towels; so pro
miscuously used in our crowded primary
and grammar schools," said Dr. C. A.
Clinton, "are the main cause of the spread
of contagious diseases . in the department.
I shall suggest that as a remedial measure
each pupil be required to bring with; him
to school his .own drinking-cup, also that
the use of towels,. by everybody , l in yards
and classrooms be prohibited.
" "Consumption is a contagious disease
and it is the natural duty of physicians
and Bchool Directors tc take every possi
ble : precaution against . its '' introduction
and spread in the public schools. It is a
mistake, though, for the people to think
that we exclude from school either teach
ers or pupils ;in '-: whose â¢ residences I there
may be consumption.:. Such would be the
course relative to smallpox, cholera, scar
let fever, diphtheria, .whooping cough, r
sore eyes, etc., ; but not â  in . cases of con
sumption unless. the pupil or teacher be
personally afflicted. .
"At the last session of the" Rules Com
mittee this rule anout contagious diseases
was referred to me for revision. The old
rule was vague and unsatisfactory, since it
did not enumerate the diseases : classed as
contagious.
- . : "While children afflicted with consump
tion, sore eyes," etc., snould be excluded
from the schools until all the danger :â¢ is
passed, there "â¢ is *no â : just : reason -i why un
afflicted children living in the same houses
where these diseases exist should be so ex
cluded. At the next session of the direc
tors, I shall offer the requisite amend
ments." 'â â¢â : . . -. '_'- ; : " â ..-â¢V'.'.".'-'. â " "â :/.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW.
The Center Market Property
Finally Leased to D.
Samuels.
THE TEEMS CF THE LEASE.
Last Week the Most Quiet of the
Year â Auction Sales An
nounced.
;â¢ The real estate market has had many
.drawbacks to contend with the past year
or two and it looks as if the end was not
yet reached. A prospective hieh tax rate
was the greatest menace a few weeks ago,
but ; that was overcome, and now come
the Assessor with what is considered an
arbitrary and uncalled-for increase in tax
able valuations of real estate lo the amount
of nearly $12,000,000. It is the opinion
that this gentleman has not had occasion
to visit the various real estate offices in the
City this year or he would have learned
long ago that values have depreciated ma
terially within the past year, and that, in
stead of any increase in the assessed val
ues of real estate, it would have been more
in keeping with existing conditions to
have reduced the assessed taxable valuation.
Many specific instances of exceedingly unjust
assessments could cited, and it Is believed
that the Assessor, if called upon to justify his
actions in the premises, would have a pretty
hard time in setting up the shadow of a de
fense.
Brokers claim that real en'ate has been com
pelled (o bear an unjust share of the burdens
of taxation for. the past year and unless the
Board of Supervisors, acting as a Board of
Equalization, will undo the work of the As
sessor, many property owners will find but
little difference in the amounts of their taxes
between this year and last. Assessing prop
erty at $2000 and making a tax rate of 2% and
assessing the same property at $2500 with a
tax rate of 1?^ comes pretty near being a stand
oft, and if the Assessor's valuation is permitted
to stand property owners will be nearly or
quite as bndly off as they were the past year.
Last week was the quietest one of the year,
as the records will shew. Two holidays within
a week, coupled with the fact that many peo
ple are at present absent from the City on va
cations, accounts nminly for the few transac
tions recorded during the week.

afternoon. â¢
Her parents live on the second story and

stop quick enough and shot through it.
She fell a distance of about twenty feet
upon a pile of kindling wood and rolled to
the ground. Her parents ran downstairs
expecting to find her mangled be.dv, but
beyond being somewhat dazed from the

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum tenoperaturÂ» for tbe
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
raintall, of melted snow in inches and huudredius,
during the paaj twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
linen, connect pom s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accomDaniPd by fair weather: "low"
rffera io low pressure, and is usually preceded
and Bccompanied by cloudy weatherand rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Whfn ;he pressure is high in thtÂ» interior
and^ low along the coas;, and th* isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "luw" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a -high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

90S Broadway, July 12. (
Ihe annual tussle between wealth, the
Assessor and the Board of Equalization
has commenced, and this year the battle
is regarded with more than the usual
amount of interest. Three out of live Su
pervisors â will be elected this November,
and the trio, who nre all anxious for re
n, are worse off than the proverbial
man between the deep sea and something
Felouzc, Johnson and Bailey are the
anxious ones, and it they can steer their
political barks to victory next November
they will prove themselves diplomats of
more than ordinary ability.
The complication is pretty. To a politi
cal student it is superb, as it offers more
ground for probabilities tnan has ever
been seen in this county. The preat point
the pons asinorum of the situation is the
question oi reducing the assessments of
the banks and corporations, noiably the
Southern Pacific property, from the figures
fixed by the Assessor. It is a situation
difficult to approach either with pen or
word of mouth, for the honesty of both
sides can be assailed, no matter what they
say or do. Take Assessor Dalton's posi
tion.
He has raised the assessments to mam
moth figures when compared witli those
that were compiled by men known to be
friendly to the railroad. Yet he declares
he has been guided by the best of advice,
and perhaps one good proof of this is that
several other Assessors in the State have
followed his example. Dalton certainly
has revolutionized the assessment rolls,
but he he has met with such strenuous op
position that whatever merit his work may
have possessed has been considerably neu
tralized, and every effort made gives his
work the appearance of having been un
dertaken for the purpose of political clap
trap. It has eveu been hinted by his
extreme enemies that Assessor Dalton has
an eye on the Governorship. All these in
sinuations make his position unpleasant
in some respects, and would discourage
him if he conld be discouraged. Da.ton,
however, ought to know by this time that it
was not the votes of the men who put him
in office who are now opposing his assess
ments and slurring his motives.
The Supervisors are infinitely worse off.
They are in a very hades of trouble. On
Monday night there will be a mass-meet
ing at the Tabernacle, and in the call are
these significant words:
An honest, fearless Assessor has done his
duty by the people of Alameda County. Prop
erly values have been fairly assessed, and the
great corporate interests of the county have
teen treated as justly as the small landowner
cr the possessor oi a moderate home. From
experiences gained last year it is probable that
the County Supervisors, sitting as a County
Board of Equalization, will attempt to undo
the work of our Assessor. That tne voice of
the people may be heard in indorsement of the
assessment and in protest of any reduction of
It by the Board of Equalization, the under
signed, representing ell political parties, pro
pose a mass-meeting fcr Monday evening, July
33, at the Tabernacle, with local speakers cap
able of explaining the position of the people.
As the question of the assessments re
ferred to is now in the hands of the Su
pervisors the call for the meeting can only
bÂ«Â» construed as a political movement,
pure ana simple. In Great Britain it
would he called coercion. If the Super
visors have any consciences they will
surely use them, independent of a icass
meeting. If tl.ey have not, a mass-meet
ing will not affect them. If the assess
ments are reduced the outgoing Super
visors are doomed; if they are not re
duced, the manipulators of the mass
nieeting will take all the glory, and will
declare that they "stiffened up" the board.
This way of "doing" politics is suggestive
of unfair play, because the men most af
<ected have no means by which they can,
nth decency, reply. It should be remem
bered that meir treatment of the assess
ments last year should have sealed their
fate, and if it did not, tuen a repetition of
their work will not produce any more ef
fect now. Bailey and Pelouze have made
their records â such as they areâ and their
consciences are as proof against mass
meetings as their acts are from impeach
ment under the present judicial adminis
tration of the county.
The chief mover of the Supervisorial
opposition, W. H. Friend, is in a worse fix
than any one. Ha has made great efforts
toward reform and deserves great credit
for what he has done. But he is now
neutralizing bis own work. He is himself
to face the public as a candidate for Super
visor. This knowledge somewhat robs his
reform record of its value, and when he
makes a patriotic speech at the Taber
nacle his er.emies wiL at once proclaim
that his desire to see the Assessor sus
tained is the natural consequence of his
ambition to succeed one of the Super
visors whom he "fears" will attempt to
"undo the work of our Assessor." If Mr.
Friend should announce from the platr
form that he is not seeking anything more
difficult to obtain than glory he can
accomplish a great local work between
now ana November.
Once again the City Prison is to the
front. For several years successive grand
juries and health officers have "recom
mended" that prisoners be kept in a place
where there is no danger of them dying
from the effect of poisonous gases. The
recommendations must be very bulky by
this time, but the decayed, unhealthy
f prison still remains. On several occasions
boys have pushed the tops from their cells
aud have walked out ; other prisoners have
pushed through a portion of the crum
bling stone wall and have walked to lib
ertyâand yet nothing is done by way of
relief.

thing he did was to '"recommend" in re

accommodation for women at all. There
is no matron, no ambulance but a clumsy

There are rats, vapors, bad sewerage, dark

nobody dreams but that Dr. Bradley's rec

A few weeks ago Oakland was flooded
with patrolmen. At all hours of the night
in the center of the city big, burly men in
uniforms wore met at every street corner
and in every doorway. Citizens wondered
why the Police Commissioners had <*eculed
so suddenly that Oakland needed so much
protection, and what was of far more in
terest they were anxious to know where
the funds were to come from to support it.
For a few weeks the nightly procession of
patrolmen was in evidence, but they grad

was made to the Police Station that only
one was left. The affair was a private ven

support it. The merchants, however, have

THE SALOON QUESTION.
Dr. Bovard Addresse* an Open Letter
to the City Trustee*.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 12.â Dr. Ebvard
of the Park-street M. E. Church read, an
open letter at his evening service as a pre
lude to his sermon, addressed to "The j
Honorable Board of Trustees of the City
of Alameda." He appeals to the trusteed
to consider three requestsâ to license no
more saloons, to enforce the present ordi
nance to the full extent of its provisions
by ruling out the duplicated sinners of pe
titions and to suppress the gambling-dens
at any cost.
"I believe," said the doctor, "that I ex
press the sentiments of nearly every citi
zen of Alameda in congratulating you
upon the eeneral good order and high
moral standard you have maintained in
our fair city. The evils and abuses of
which I am about to speak stand out the
more glaringly and inflict a deeper insult
because they contrast so strongly with the
good character of the city.
"Without attempting to discuss the
merits of any application lor saloon
licenses now before your honorable board,
I uru compelled by a strong sense of duty
to my congregation, and in some sense to
my fellow-citizens, to give voice to the
almost universal conviction in this city
that we want no additional saloons."
The doctor calls the attention of the
board to section 4 of the city's ordinance.
No. 167, which provides that twenty-five
heads of families or proprietors of busi
ness places shall sign the recommendation
for the license.
"Upon examination of the list of signers
I find that some of these heads of families
havo repeated their privilege from two to
six times, thue acting in the capacity and |
discharging the functions of six citizens
instead of one."
The doctor say* that in the "1500" block
on Park street there are five saloons, witn
only sixty actual signers, instead of 125;
on the "1300" blook, three saloons, with
only forty-four signers, and that the nine
saloons on Park street have only 119 sign
ers, whereas they should have 225.
The doctor contends that under the ordi
nance no man has the right to sign more
than one saloon-keeper's petition.
The closing portion ol the letter draws
the trustees' attention "to the most scan
dalous and flagrant violation of tho ordi
nance prohibiting gambling." The doc
tor wants to know "why the police officers
do not clean nut these vipers' nests. It
can hardly be supposed that they are the
only persons in Alameda who are unaware
of these abuses. Perhaps they thinli it is
less trouble to let them alone."

903 Broadway, July 12. f
Hundreds of pretty snow-white tents
repose in Trestle Glen. Flitting about
everywhere among the trees and canvas
houses are people in picturesque cos
tumes, while from every tent-pole can be
seen the stars and stripes and the banner
of the Salvation Army.
The fifth annual encampment of the fol
lowers of General Booth opened to-day
and the pretty glen was as lively as a fair.
If the Volunteer movement has drawn
awayfrom the regular Salvationists it is
not apparent at the camp-meetine, which
is more numerously attended than any
previous gathering of the kind.
As a visitor listens to the singing it re
calls the times of the Covenanters who
gathered in Glencoe, and the freedom and
protection guaranteed the Salvationists,
as contrasted with the oppression from
the English soldiery under the dastardly
command of Graham of Claverhouse, rep
resent exactly the progress of religious
freedom in two centuries.
Officers are there from all over the State
and an impromptu reunion is in progress
the whole day. The tenters were holding
receptions continuously and many clasped
hands who only have the opportunity to
do so at the annual compmeeeting.
A blind man walking through the glen
could have told the nature of the gather
ing. The ear alone would solve any doubt
on that point.
"Hallelujah, so your'ro Btill saved."
"God bless you, sister."
"Praise the Lord, there's brother
Jones."
"Yes, and I'm still happy on the way."
"God bless Father Aaams."
"How's Visalia? "
"Still fighting the dovil."
These are scraps of the salutes and con
versations that are heard all over t ho glen
from morning till nitrht, and after the
light in the western sky has disappeared
little hymns of praise can be heard issu
ing from the interior of the tents as the in
mates chant their farewell to the day and
ask protection through the night.
The large hall erected for and used
nearly all the year as a dancehall does not
look natural iillrd with Salvationists. The
whole glen is turned over to the Salva
tionists for two weeks. Even the refresh
ment-room and bar is closed, nor will it
be opened until the last "hallelujah" is
uttered and the place is abandoned to the
world, the flesh and the devil, till next
year's meeting.
Brigadier Keppel and his staff formally
opened the camp at 7a. m. "The Attack' 1
was the subject, and it wns treated in a
very aggressive ffshion. Major Mclntyre
Bpoke at 11 a. m. on "Save the Others" â¢
Staff Captain Thomas told of "True Won
ders" in the afternoon, and at night Briga
dier and Mrs. Kepnel talked about "Sheep
and Goats." The large hall was packed at
every service, but even this did not seem
to thin the numbers on the erounds, who
appeared as numerous as when the meet
ing dispersed.
The crowds were very enthusiastic, and
the volume" of. sound that ascended, irom
the glen when all joined In chorus could
be heard half a mile off.
There is a marked appearance of com
munism among Salvationists in camp.
The banner at the door of the tent is a
standing invitation, and officers and
soldiers can be detected making tours of
discovery for old iriends, but strictly con
lining themselves to tents which have the
army coat of arms.
Ensign McFee and his wife of Lifeboat
fame were on the grounds. Serjeant-
Major Brown of Oakland, who established
the work that now flourishes in San Quen
tin, is in camp.
Sergeant Brown's quarters should be
used as a model for campers. He has a
large family, and his tent contains more
to the square foot than can be found un
der any canvas in the glen. The sergeant,
although he saves souls at night and Sun
day, is a hard-working builder during the
â¢ hiv, and is i one of the most unassuming*
men En uniform.
The programme for Monday is:
'"Persistency,'' Ensign Jackson and
Captain Jones; "Bankrupt Lives," Ad

Pounds That Are Interesting and

Oakland Office San Feascisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 12. f
H. L. Weitzel, poundmaster of Oakland,
made a discovery to-day.
A poundkeeper is no longer looked upon
as a human brute who takes supreme
pleasure in tormenting, starving and kill
ing all animals that he can turn loose and
catch.
The time is coming, and in some cities
has already come, when the poundkeeper
is regarded as a humane official whose du
ties are second only to those of the red
cross varieties.
Poundmaster Weitzel knows more to
night about pounds and dogs and the
method of killing them than any other
poundmafeter in the country. He sat at
his desk all of to-day studying. Some
weeks ago he sent letters to all the pound
masters in the large cities of the United
States. To-day he was studying their an
swers. Some were a revelation, many
amusing, but all were interesting.
Mr. Weitzel is ambitious to have a model
pound in this city. It is under the con
trol of the Humane Society, and this has
proved to be the best system for pound
government yet devised.
Atlanta, Ga., is the dog's paradise of the
country. In tnat Southern city curs and
mongrel canines of all descriptions roam
at will. They fear not the policeman with
poisoned meat, nor the man with the
scoop-net. City Clerk J. W. Phillip,
writes: "We hare no dog pound, and do
not catch dogs." If dogs could but be ad
vised of the news what an exodus there
would be from the Pacific Coast to the At
lantic.
At Galveston, nine mounted policemen
catch stock and dogs, and are paid what to
Oaklanders would be two weeks' salary,
viz., $50 a month. Chief of Police W. O.
Jones says his men catch about 350 dogs
during each summer month, and only 1
per cent is redeemed. The 346}Â£ are caÂ«
joled into an air-tight room, under which
ia a furnace adapted for burning sulphur.
When the connection is made, the stray
dogs are gently asphyxiated. A peculiarity
of the Galveston ordinance is that it costs
I $3 to redeem a goat and only $1 per head
of stock. This will sound strange to the
Oakland con-owner who has to pay $4
every time his cow his lassoed by the
poundman.
About 400 dogs are caught at St. Louis,
and the pound costs |300 a month. When
the dogs are not redeemed Poundmaster
U. L. Price treats them to a fatal inhala
tion of sulphur fumes.
The pound department of the city of
Chicago is an important part of the gov
ernment. There are eight stock pounds
and six doe-catchers on waeons, and on
each' wagon is a regular police officer.
About 2000 does are caught every month
during the season of six months, and very
few are redeemed. This is the way Super
intendent Eli Montgomery writes of the
manner of destroying dog 3: '"We have an
airtight box that will hold fifty or seventy
five dogs, and a charcoal furnace with
pipe connecting with the box. After kind
ling a fire in the furnace with charcoal we
place sulphur on the fire, the fames of
which are conducted into the box, produc
ing death in a very few minutes.
The Buffalo dog pound is conducted by
the Humane Society, but is under the con
trol of the police. About 700 loose dogs
[ are caught every month, and are placed in
a box rilled with gas. "It takes about fif
teen seconds before the dogs are stiff,"
says Dr. W. Clinson of the Erie County
Humane Society. "No pain or suffering
is noticed, and this method gives general
satisfaction."
The desire to use a gun that prevails in
Arkansas runs even to shooting dogs. Judg
ing by the fees the poundmaster cannot
receive a vory large fortune, as it would
appear that he (rets a large part of his
satisfaction in using his gun.
Chief of Police Frank McMahon says:
"We catch dogs with a wire loop and put
them In a wagon on the spot. We Kill them

The poundkeeper rents the pound, and
gets 35 cents for cattle and horses and 10
cents for dogs ana goats. The State law
requires the stock-catcher, where stock is
known to belong outside of city limits, to
drive them to the limits and not impound
them."
Chief of Police Moseley of Memphis,
Term., tells of an ingenious method of
ridding the city of vagrant dogs. He
says: "The pound is under the direction
of the Chief of Police, and the pound offi
cer is appointed by the Police Commis
sioners. He is a uniformed policeman and
receives the same pay, $75 per month. We
employ no deputies, but use one or two
negroes who are working out misdemeanor
fines to go with the officer and drive in
the stock. Our method of destroying dogs
is to prepare about 200 small pieces of
cooked meat, in which we insert a small
quantity of strychnine with the point of a
| sharp knife. Each officer on night duty
takes about twelve of these pieces, which
are put in a small paper bag, and as va
grant dogs pass about on his beat he
throws them a piece of the meat, and in a
few minutes the work is done. The city
pays a scavenger $50 a month to haul
away any dead animal found in the city,
and this includes coisoned dogs."
Tramp canines in New York and Brook
lyn are treated very tenderly. "The whole
of such work is now entirely under the
control of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals," said
John P. Haines, the president. "The men
engaged in the work are paid a monthly
salary. Each man is under a $1000 bond
aud their compensation ia not regulated
by the number of dogs which they seize.
The dogs are caught by hand only and are
Killed by illuminating gas, which, after an
experience of many years, we find is the
most humane and at the same time the
most convenient and economical method
yet devised."
The Humane Society also conducts the
pound at Cincinnati and the 164 dogs
caught each month are driven into a big
box. The lid is put on, the gas turned on
and in about eighteen to twenty minutes
their spirits have departed.
Poundmaster John Foster of Portland,
Oregon, is the only man that resorts to
drowning. "We destroy about a hundred
dogs a month," said Mr. Foster. "In kill
ing them we place them in an iron cage.
They are then lowered in the Colombia
River In numbers of 20 to 25, and after
ward sent to the crematory."
All stray dogs at the National capital are
caught in a net and shot through the
brain. About 250 dogs are treated this
way every month. The pound is con
ducted by the Health Office and costs $400
per month.
Poundmaster G. H. McLaughlin of Phil
adelphia is a facetious individual. His
visiting card contains the inscription :
"Have you been an Odd Fellow twenty
one years? If so, come and join us."
About one-half of the card is taken up
with the most anarlish specimen of a cur
ever caught in a poundman's net,
George Washington Lavender is the
name of a poundmaster of Memphis, Term.

scrutinized its surface irom the time of
tho first telescopic efforts to the present
we are compelled to conclude that there are
no people who live in the moon. The
wonderful combination of mountain and
crater, valley and peak, is. after all, only
a vast graveyard; and if living beings
ever roamed over its plains and
navigated its great eeas, now dry,
or frozen with appalling cold, they have
been gathered to the nations of the dead;
and all traces of them having vanished,
the tall shafts of the mountains watch
over their last resting-place, and, with the
crnter rings, constitute their sternal and
magnificent mausoleum. â Ladies' Home

IDEA OF A DRIVE,

the Park to the
Mission.

Superintendent McLaren of Golden Gate
Park is a man who is a great admirer of
nature and who has an eye for natural
beauties, and more than that he is a prac
tical man wtio knows where art may as
sist and improve nature's work.
He is a firm believer in the necessity of |
parks for the people, and next to parks he j
believes that they ought to have drives. 1
While it is true that the main park is one
of the finest in the United States, there is i
a lack of tine drives and many persons
who would locate in San Francisco fail to
do so on account of lack of roads over i
which they could drive, and seek homes J
in territory across the bay.
Superintendent McLaren has an idea that
at a comparatively small cost a new drive
could be built which would not only prove 1
an additional attraction to the City, but be
the means of developing a section of
country that is little known.
"This road," said Mr. McLaren, "could
connect with Golden Gate Park at Seventh i
avenue. It could be built so as to run â¢
south, then along a little creek, through a j
canyon where there is an easy, natural >
grade, pass by that large cluster of euca- j
lypius trees that is visible to any one rid
ing on the San Mateo electric line of cars,
and connect with the road leading to the
House of Correction and from there to the
Mission district. That could be made a
cross country drive about nine miles in 1
lenuth. one that has much wild natural
rock scenery, and one which for the most !
part would have the advantage of being !
sheltered from the high winds which pre
vail at times.
"The people in the East appreciate the
value ol good roads, and they are spending
money to make such, in order to keep j
people within the territory in which they
run. By that means people are prevented
from going to other sections where there
are fine and attractive drives. To me it is
â¢stoniafaing that the matter has not been :
agitated long ago.*'
The animal family in the Park is still on !
the increase. Last week there was an ad
dit ion in the deer park of two does and a
baby elk, making seven births in the Zoo I
within three weeks, "and the way things j
is running," said the policeman in that J
section of the Park, % 'I don't know how j
many more there's going to be before j
summer is over." The baby buffalo was â 
out from under cover yesterday, and he |
was watched by a large number of people.
As yet the Commissioners have not laid
out any work for the future, but they are
busy examining plans, one in particular,
that (or the proposed bridge on Ihe main ;
drive over the large tunnel recently com- '<
pleted.
During the past week the museum has !
been enriched by a number of curiosities. â 
One is a certificate of membership in the i
first Vigilance Committee of San Fran- j
cisco. It is printed on blue paper, bears j
date of June 9, 1856, and the signature of 1
Selim E. Wood worth, president, and Isaac ]
Biuxome Jr., secretary, and was issued to â 
L. E. Wakeman. This, with other his- j
toric papers, an eskimo canoe, covered j
with walrus skins, and a pair of Alaskan
snowshoes were contributed by Colouel A. I
S. Hubbard.
F. H. Lattin donated a number of birds' ;
egÂ£S. J. L. Bardwell turned in a number !
of articles, including two peculiar-shaped j
silver-covered goblets or chalices, two j
fancy birch boxes covered with porcupine 1
quills, a peculiarly shaped bottle made by
the Haida Indians on Queen Charlotte
Island and a very large tortoise shell.
J. Z. Davis has donated to the museum
more than a hundred Indian specimens,
which for a long time he had on exhibi
tion in the Mining Bureau in this City.
The walfcs in front of the new lodge in
the park have been covered with a coating
of coarse gravel, mixed with broken sea
shells from the ocean beach. This has
proved so satisfactory that it is probable
gravel of this character will be used as a
toi> dressing for the footpaths in the park.
â¢ In the conserve tory. Head Gardener Hol
brow is happy because he has a number of
new blossoms to display. One is in the
circle under the dome, "it is the flower of
a very attractive growth, a native of Bra
zil, the leaves of which are remarsable for
their many perforations. The flower, which
is nearly ten inches long, is cream white,
in some places nearly an inch thick and
looks very much like ar. immense un
opened magnolia with a quarter section
sliced off from top to bottom. Within it
there is a large growth that, when the
flower withers, ripens and tastes like a
mealy apple. "It's edible," said Mr.
Holbrow, "but I do not think any one
would hanker for it." This plant,
called the Monstera Deiiciosa, or
delicious monster, is a creeper in
South America, clingin k to trees as does the
common ivy. The uppermost leaves are
sometimes a hundred feet above the
ground. From various heiehts on the pa
rt nt stem there spread tendrils the thick
ness of a finger, the ends of which reach
and bury themselves i.i the ground. By
means of them a person may climb to the
top as easily as a sailor can climb up toe
shrouds of a yessel.
There was the usual large crowd at
"Sutrovilleby-the-Sea," and those who
visited the baths were entertained with
racing in the big tank, trapeze perform
ances over the water, the wonderful per
formances by Mme. Yiiz and trained
cockatoos.
During the afternoon Mayor Sutro
descended to the platform where bathers
only are allowed, and while standing
there he was greeted with "hurrahs" from
the bathers, cheers from men in the gal
leries and the waving of handkerchiefs by
the ladies iv every part of the building.
It was a sort of spontaneous ovation, and
the Mayor acknowledged it by gracefully
raising his hat and bowing to those who
thus unexpectedly honored him.
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon there was
an immense crowd on the pier of the'
Olympic Salt Water Company and on the
beach near it. Two Kanakas were swim
ming in the surf just for exercise. They
appeared as much at ease in the heavy
breakers as if tbey had been in the smooth
est water.
At the Halght-street grounds there was
v greater crowd yesterday afternoon than
has been there for some time. The Casino
was crowded to ita utmost capacity by
tin se who wanted to witness the excellent
vaudeville performance presented. The
evidences of the recent fire are rapidly dis
appearing, and ail day yesterday a force of
men were making repairs so that the
scenic railway may be in running order
to-morrow.
Some of the grades are being slightly
altered, and the tunnel, which was over
the Casino, will be erected over the eastern
end of the track.
A novelty has been placed on the .
ground. It is a mechanical panorama. '
worked by electricity, and is the result of
three and a half years' work of a young
man named Fraser. It is an ingenious .
piece of work and very interesting.
The performances in the Casino are con- (
tinued every afternoon and evening, and -
tbey draw well.

THE ELITE AT
A COCKING MAIN,
Select Crowd of Sports
Meet at the Foot of
Tamalpais.
THREE WOMEN PRESENT
Centra Costa and San Francisco
Counties Have an Old-
Time Fight.
THE FORMER THE WINNER.
How the Veteran Con Mooney Was
Fed on Game Cocks by a
Blundering Caterer.
The cockfighter will not down. The
same thrill a Spaniard has in seeing the
matador thrust his sword into the heart of
an infuriated bull is his when the game
cock again and again punches the gaff
into the neck of a chicken. If the latter,
cut up and feeble from exertion and loss
of blood, fights on till death the thrill is
more intense, according to toe amount of
savageness displaj'ed by the victorand the
endurance of the vanquished.
The cockfighter argues that the sport is
not so cruel as dogfighting, driving horse
races, coursing or prizefighting, and he
does not propose to be done out of his
pet pastime by the arbitrary regulations
of cities or townships.
The undisputable proof of all this was
given yesterday in the shade of old Mount
Tamalpais, where one of the biggest and
most aristocratic mains of this year was
successfully held.
It was a big main in the respect that
Contra Costa and San Francisco counties,
the two best gamecock producers, were
pitted. Thirty birds on either side, trained
and ready to battle, were shipped over to
Sausalito Saturday night. This was done
in the old-time conventional way, each
cock being inclosed in a gunnysack tied at
the neck. In days gone by, a man with a
gunnysack the contents of which wriggled,
chuckled and crowed, attracted but little
attention. It was different, however, on
Saturday evening's ferry-boat. The un
usual occurrence attracted much attention,
and the residents of Sausalito were on the
lookout all of yesterday for the treat they
expected was in store for them.
The aristocratic end of the main was in
its seiection. This was an exclusive
affair, more so than in those days when a
five-dollar note was collected from each
sport as he gained entrance to the pit. A
few of the veterans in such affairs were
present. They were not many, for most
of them have passed away or are not now
in fit physical condition to take long jour
neys such as are necessitated while chas
ing away from constables, sheriffs and
the like meddlesome gentry. The new
element which figured yesterday at the
pitside consisted mainly of clerks in high
positions, both civil and official; Judges
of police and Superior Courts, a city
father or so and three ladies who have
often graced the salons of upper tendom.
Barring an expression or two of "Oh,
my dear," "Poor thing, is it much hurt?"
wnen one bird jabbed out another's eye
with its steel spur, these ladies had a
splendid outing. They laughed at the
ludicrous appearance of the cocks, shorn
of their extra plumaare. just as a prize
fighter's hair is cut close to the scalp prior
to entering the ring. They wagered gloves,
candy and even money on which would
prove the victor in the engagement that
must almost necessarily end in the death
of one or both roosters.
It is generally accepted that pleasure
most difficult to acquire is that which is
best appreciated. Apparently from their
yesterdays outing, these ladies were enti
tled to all the fun they enjoyed.
It was hoped that the main could be
brought off in Sausalito. Why not? Pool
rooms that are prohibited from running
in every town and hamlet of>the State ran
there in full blast and with open doors,
where even boys and young girls may be
come educated to gambling.
But the City Trustees of Sausalito drew
the line at cock-hguting. Constable Gar
rity, wide awake as usual, set his foot
down on the sport ana declared that the
order from tne City Trustees must be
obeyed. George Ginn, ex- Mayor ol Sau
taiito, was sworn in as a deputy constable,
and he too assisted in enforcing the law.

paper man, who presides over the Na
tional Athletic Club of this City, where
Corbett and Shartey recently had their go
as-you-please fight, refused absolutely to
lend his presence to encouraging the hold
ing of chicken fights in the place he has
chosen for his summer home.
These things delayed the affair many
hours. Instead of taking place in a com
fortable barn within a half hour's run to
the ferry, it was conducted twelve miles
away. To get there proved a big hitch,
owing to Judge Belhue's refusal to lend
his buses. An hour or so was consumed
procuring other conveyances, into which
the sports and the gamecocks were
stowed. That was a merry ride in the hot
sun and dust, the roosters signifying their
presence by crowing all along the road,
and especially when passing the barnyards
of wayside ranches.
The first fight for $20 a side opened the
festivities at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Tne birds, a five-pound-two-ounce red
Spanish representing Frisco, and a slightly
heavier white bird doing the same for
Contra Costa. The usual shearing and
heeling took up some time, during which
the people present became quite well ac
quainted.
"It's too bad old Con Mooney isn't
here," remarked a man who is au fait in
sued matters to a coterie of listeners.
Mooney is one of the best known sport
ing men in the State. He is slightly
rheumatic now and is not so well able to
get around as he used to.
"Did you ever hear about that chicken
dinner Mooney and a few of us had in San
Jose?" another fellow asked.
"Well, we had gone down there to have
a main at the old racetrack. This was
about ten or twelve years ago, when Con
tra Costa and Frisco were fighting Santa
Clara.
"Mooney had a couple of 'larlee-coolers,'
each in a sack, and expected to make a
good killing against the Mexicans down
there, who would bet as long as they had a
dollar to back their opinion.
"Arriving at San Jose some three hours
ahead of time and feeling hungry, we all
went over across the way from the station.
We bad a drink or two and Mooney
handed his two gunnysacks to the Italian
caterer, telling him to take them down
stairs, their crowing attracting too much
attention.
"A few more drinks and an order for
dinner was given. 'Give us the best
you've got, plenty of it and quick.'
"The Italian kept the crowd waiting
longer than it seemed necessary, and the
hungry gang began clamoring for food.
"Presently the hearts of taose present
were gladdened when the tables were set
and laden with a lovely-smelling chicken
stew and some heavy blue wine. Tue
chicken, to be sure, was a little tough, but
that made no great difference to good
te eth and hungry stomachs.
"The hour for our departure arrived,
and with that important air that comes with
the satisfaction of having been kind to
one's self, Mooney shouted:
" 'Here you are, Mr. Macaroni, fetch me
those sacks of mine.'
" 'Verree well, Mista Moon,' answered
the caterer, and he soon reappeared with
the two empty gunnysacks.
" 'Where are my chickens?' asked
Mooney in thundering tones.
"'You ela da chick, Mr. Moon!' ex
claimed the Italian, in astonishment that
his guest had so soon forgotten his sump
tuous lunch."
This story being told and a general
laugh having put all hands in good hu
mor, the red and white birds were breasted
and the first fight of the main was in pro
gress.
The 'Frisco representative proved a
clever "wheeler," striking and seeking
shelter under the white bird's wing just as
Corbett and Sharkey avoided punishment
by clinching after each blow. The en
gagement was greatly prolonged in conse
quence, and exhaustion, rather than loss
of blood, brought it to a conclusion.
The white was gaffed early in the fight,
and he subsequently showed it was not to
his liking. "He's a quitter!" shouted
one of his backers; "he'll jump the pit,
sure."
The words were hardly spoken when
Contra Costa's representative turned tail
and flew out, the red cock pursuine him.
In such cases the backer or handler of
the pursuer counts forty in rapid succes
sion. This is called the finish count and
the birds were separated and breasted
once more in the center of the pit. A
couple of passes were made and the white
cock again turned tail. Again counting
was done. The rule prescribes that only
ten need ba counted the second time,
when again the fowls must be breasted.
Should the counts of ten occur five times
in succession the bird refusing to fight
must be declared a loser.
When the white bird flew the pit the
second time his handler agreed with the
man who baa so appropriately called him
a ''quitter." He knew there was no use
trying to make him fight, so he withdrew
him, giving Frisco the battle.
Frisco scored another win with a four
pound eight-ounce white stag against a
red four-pound six-ounce cock. A stae is
a bird not yet fifteen months old. Above
that age the bird is a cock. It was a well
fought and stubborn battle, the youngster
making a blinker of his foe in the second
pass by gouging out bis right eye with the
steel gaff. After that the older bird rap
idly got the worst of the fight, but
gamely fought on until he died in the pit.
Frisco's first reverse was in the third
fight, for $25 a side and several hundreds
of dollars between individuals. The affair
was as unfortunate as it was brief. At the
first pass Frisco broke his right leg, and
was withdrawn. Some of the bystanders
would have had the battle continue, even
going so far as to suggest: "Let him kill
him." Others prevailed, however, and
Contra Costa got the purse. The letter's
bird was untouched and willing to accom
modate another bird, which Frisco soon
furnished. Again Contra Costa proved
victorious, killing a bird two ounces heav
ier than itself.
Another broken leg settled Frisco's fate
in the fifth engagement. The cocks had
been at it with honors principally in
Frisco's favor. There was $25 a side up
and odds of $10 to $8 were being given
against Contra Costa. In some unaccount
able manner Frisco's right gaff lodged in
its left leg, and when the steel was with
drawn the unfortunate bird's shoulder was
round to be broicen. He fought on gamely,
but his only serviceable lee he needed to
rest on and could, therefore, be only on
the defensive. He was withdrawn in time
not to meet his coup de grace.
Other battles, lasting far into the night,
terminated with Contra Costa winning
eight out of fifteen fights.

The colored people of San Francisco as

the purpose of holding commemoration

services in honor of Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe, the authoress of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin."
The little weather-beaten church in
which the memorable Starr King bekl its
first service and at which in his
early days some of the then
most prominent families attended di
vine worship was filled during the ser
vices yesterday. They were there to pay
respect if not veneration to the woman
who through her work, the world-wide
read "Untie Tom's Cabin, "did so much to
bring the colored race out of slavery.
How well this noble woman succeeded
history and to-day's conditions are the
best witnesses.
This great work for a suffering and down
trodden race is so fully appreciated by the
people who have been benefited by it that
an output of gratitude from joyous hearts
is the response over the broad land wtiere
ever a colored nan or woman may be
found.
That Harriet Beecher Stowe felt in her
heart for the amelioration of the colored
slave there could be no doubt, and that
this race to-day feels deeply indebted to
her memory is equally true and sincere.
The services were opened yesterday aft
ernoon by T. B. Morton, a gifted speaker
and a leading light among his people.
Every Beat in the church was filled with
men, women and children. The latter, in
their handsome summer dresses of various
hues and up-to-date head gear, presented
a novel as also a pleasant picture to be
hold.
Mr. Morton, in calling the meeting to
order, said:
Friends, ladles and gentlemen: We have as
sembled this afternoon to do honor to Â»he great
Hie and work and to contribute our highest
mark of respect to the memory of one whose
true positicu in history will stand in the front
rank of the noblest Christian men and women
that have ever lived.
For no one person, in no single work or argu
ment, has spoken so effectively to as many dif
ferent people in so man? different languages
and tongues in defense of the oppressed as did
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Mrs. Stowe was born at Lltchflcld, Conn., on
June 14, 1812, and departed this liieon Julyl,
189t>, In the eighty-tihn year of her age. These
exercises are appropriate and commendable in
our people, and we take this method of Know
ing ou* appreciation of her whose memory we
have assembled here to commemorate and to
pass down the lesson of gratitude and honor
to our children for future generations.
Scripture reading by the Rer. E. T. Cott
nian was attentively listened to, after
which the Rev. J. J. Sitton. a white man
and minister of Cumberland Presbyterian
Church, offered prayer to the Almighty
for his blessings uoon his colored brethren
in this their hour of joy and sorrowâ joy
for the blessings of freedom and sorrow
for the loss of a noble woman whom they
loved.
A. CollinÂ«, president of the meeting,
followed in a panegyric on the life and
labors of fciis. Harriet Beecher Stowe and
finished by exhorting his hearers to live
good lives and by so doing convince the
world that the emancipation of 4,000,000
human beings was not a mistake on the
part of those who offered up their lives as
a sacrifice. He continued :
"The foresight given Mrs. Stowe was
nothing short of an inspiration from Al
mighty God, and to her, unaer God, must
great if not all credit be given for the free
dom enjoyed to-day by the colored peo
ple.
"It was owing to her work and directed
by the same unseen power that the hand
of the mighty Lincoln signed the de
cree of emancipation which with one
stroke freed 4,000,000 of human beings
from bondage."
The Rev. H. J. Callis, minister of Zion
Church, followed with one of his most
able and eloquent addresses, first touching
upon the equality of the sexes and then on
the dividing line which had separated the
two races before. Mrs. Stowe opened not
only the eyes of the American people, but
the eyes of the whole civilized world.
He followed with a masterly paneeyric
of the noble qualities of this great woman,
whose memory would never die but
would remain a household word aa long as
a colored man or woman lived.
He feelingly portrayed the auction
block in Baltimore, where the Alabama
rufhans used to come with a pocket full of
gold and often examine the muscles of
the chattels there offered for sale, separ
ate son from father and mother and sister
from brother. But this condition of
shameless affairs is passed forever, thanks
to Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Closing exercises were had, including a
recitation by Miss Jackson, history of
Mrs. Stowe's life by Mrs. Rice and ad
dresses by Mr. Henderson and the Revs.

"VOTE FOR McKINLEY."
That Is the Advice of President
Morton of the Afro-American
League to His People.
T. B. Morton, president of the Afro-
American League, is in receipt of a letter
from the Searchlight published at Los
Angeles asking the question if Afro-
Americans should support McKinley and
incidentally seeking an opinion on the
money question. The letter in question
reads as follows:
Los ANGa.ES, Cal., July 3, 1896.
T. B. Morton, President Afro- American League,
San /Vane wcoâ Dear Sir: Do you think the
Afro-Americans ought to support McKinley
and the Republican party this fall? Is tne Re
publican platform broad enough for all Afro-
Americans to stand upon? Which is the most
important to the Afro-Americansâ the money
or the suffrage question? Please â¢ write your
answer for publication in the McKinley edi
tion of the Searchlignt, which will : be pub
lished July 10. Let me hear from you not
later than Wednesday. An early reply is so
licited. Yours respectfully,
" J. L. Edmonds, Editor.
'In reply to this, 1 President Morton, who
is a power among his own people, writes
as follows:
July 8, 1896.
â T. L. Edmondn. E*q., Editor Searchlight,', Los
Angeles,' Cal.â My Dear Kjb: Yours of recent
dote, propounding three Important ques
tions on the position the Afro - Ameri
cans should take in the great political contest
this year, received and contents noted. You
will find my views fully expressed as to the
Republican party in The Call of. this City in
last Sunday's issue.
As to our supporting Major McKinley, the
Republican nominee for President, I have just
this to say. Major McKinley is the ideal
statesman of America, the stanch friend of
the negro. He is among the few great men of
this age to whom credit can be given that dur- |
ing his long public life he has stood squarely
and firmly by , the principles of the great Re
publican party. The principles of . the parly,
I will say frankly, are broad enough for any
man, woman or child to stand upon. The oniy
question that should concern us is simply this
one: Have we men at the head of the party
who have the force of character to stand man
fully by these great * principles and uphold
them? . |
At the National Convention at Minneapolis,
while making the â  opening speech as chair
man, Major McKinley, after referring to pro
tection and . reciprocity, said: â¢ "We are to de
clare ourselves upon other questions here to
day. We are to declare ourselves ' : on the
question of a free ballot and a - fair
count. No platform should have been
made by a -Republican convention that
did not reiterate that great constitutional
guaranty. No Republican speech should ever
be made that did . not Insist firmly, and reso
lutely insist, that that great constitutional guar
anty shall bo a living birthright, not the cold
formality of constitutional enactment, but a
living thing, which the poorest and humblest
may confidently enjoy, and which the rich and
the most powerful uare not deny." The above
utterances are grand, noble and sublime,
spoken at a time when he was not seeking or
expecting vows, but standing firmly as Â«the
acklowledged leader of a great party, shaping
its future and building Its platform. Our in
terest is safe in his hands, and 'not only ours,
but the Nation's. -
- If McKlnley is elected prosperity will be seen
in all parts of our fair land.
â  Now as to the money question I have only
this to say: If McKinley and the Republican
party grant 1,000.000 negroes of this country
in every and all parts of it, a fair and unmo- !
lested road .to the ballot-box, and have our
ballots counted in common with other Amer
ican citizens, we are completely 'satisfied with
any kind of money they may give us. Human
liberty, trial by jury and the right to earn , a
dollar are the most important questions that
are to be considered by as. Give us these and
all other rights will follow.
_ At the coming congress, which is to convene
In your city August 11, we will deal with these
questions, I trust, in such a way that the poli
ticians and honest citizen* of . this State may
see and appreciate our position. . (
â¢â¢"I would. say in conclusion, McKinley, with |
his force of character, the knowledge we have i
had of him while leader of the House in the
great contests on Federal election law, the
Blair educational ' bill â  and 2 other important
questions, easily proclaim him as not only the
most available man, but the man above all
others that should have â¢ our unanimous sup
port.; I look forward with great pleasure-to
the meeting . in Los Angeles, the ' most Impor
tant gathering we have had in the State.
â  11 1 have answered your question I am grate
ful, and if I have not you will not only know
my position on ; thoÂ«e questions, but when we

VOTERS MAY BE
DISFRANCHISED,
The Central Office Cannot
Record All Their
Names
IN TWENTY-THREE DAYS
Registrar Hinton Issues a Time
ly Warning to Register
at Once.
GRAVE DANGERS IN DELAYING.
Precinct Registration May Not Be
Held, So It Should Not Ba
Considered.
The Republican County Committee is
making timely preparations for precinct
registration so as to be ready in case the
Supreme Court of California should de-
cide in favor of the old law providing for
registering voter* in every precinct of the
City. When the Election Commissioners
meet to-day to review the names sub
mitted for officers of precinct registration
the Republican County Committee will
have presented a long list of judges for
various precincts.
This alertness on the part of the com
mittee is, however, a mere precautionary
measure, for it is believed by officers of the
committee thnt there will be no registra
tion this year in the precincts.
"My advice," said Charles W. Man
waring, chairman of the county committee
lost night, ''is to register at once. There
is a possibility of no precinct registration
this time, and besides the Registrar has
so much work before him there is danger
that if people leave registering to the last
few days they cannot possibly get their
names placed on the register. This is a
serious matter now.
"Every yote counts and nobody should
neglect this duty, but should at once go to
the City Hall and register. The Republi
can County Committee has preached this
from the first. The Democrats held out
last time for precinct registration and i
believe thelroqaois Club is doing the same
thing now. Every voter in San Francisco
should register ri ht now and not leave it
to the last moment. If he is not careful
he may not be able to vote at all."
Registrar Hinton says he believes that
unless voters stand in line immediately
and register at his office fu:ly 20,000 citi
zens may be debarred from voting at the
election through the very inability of his
office to take the names of all applicants
in the rush of the closing days. Regis
tration closes August 3 in the central
office and August 8 in the precincts â
if precinct registration he held. During
the fifty-one days ended Friday a total of
14,263 names were recorded. During the
corresponding period in 1894 16, 172 were
enrolled.
During the day and the three hours of
night registration vesterduy 1753 voters
were registered, the largest number sched
uled during any day since the central
office opened. The next highest number
was recorded on Friday, when 1045 names
were listed. It is estimated that more
than 75.000 votes should be cast this year
in tne Presidential election. Only twenty
three days remain during which names
may be registered at the City Hall.
Registrar Hinton estimates that there
will t>e over 60,000 voters to be listed and
that with his present working force it will
be utterly impossible to register them all.
The best day's record for one man, work
ing eight nours, has been 100 names.
There are sixteen clerKs employed in the
booth proper, and therefore to register
1600 names a day will be to strike about
the limit. The force can be increased to
eighteen men, but this will not suffice.
The highest record for one day in San
Francisco at the central bureau Is
2506 voters, bur this being the last
day of central registration in 1894, it was
continued until late at night and without
interruption during meal hours.
To take all the names between now and
August 3, it has been estimated, would re
quire the enrollment of more than 2000
names 3 day, which is not practicable
under the present conditions. This fact
has given rise to a movement to keep open
the central office for registration night and
day, with a double force of clerks on duty
all the time.

counties outside San Francisco has raised
the doubt as to the validity of precinct
registration.
Originally this law especially exempted
San Francisco from its provisions, and
San Francisco was then governed by the
special registration act passed for tne con
solidated City and County; but the fram
ers of the new general law eliminated the
clause excepting San Francisco from .its
provisions, and this, as competent, author
ities declare, brings the City under the
provisions of tbe general law. This gen
eral law says that all registration shall
cease ninety days before the general elec
tion. The special law governing San
Francisco says that all registration shall
cease fifteen days before the election.
The Iroquois Club has taken the question
before the Supreme Court on mandamus
proceedings. So everything now rests
with the court, from which a decision is
expected daily.
Meanwhile the Republican County Com
mittee is selecting its judges of precinct
registration, and will be ready to watch
the interests of Republican voters should
the court decide in favor of precinct regis
tration.
The only way, however, to avoid the
risk of being disfranchised this singularly
important year is to go to-day or to-mor
row to the Registrar's office and have your
name recorded there.
WHAT SOCIETY IS DOING
Dr. A. H Giannini Is P easantly Sur

Southern Tour.
One of the most successful and enjoy

dered to Dr. Attilio H. Giannini at tbe
home of his parents, 604 Filbert street, on
last Friday evening, July 3.
On the evening mentioned the doctor,
who has recently graduated from the
Medicai Department of the University
of California, had returned home from
an extended trip through the south,
and instead of being greeted by the mem
bers of the household, as he anticipated,
about forty young friends had assembled
in tbe laree and spacious parlors to join in
the hearty welcome. Professor Deviini's
orches:ra, consisting entirely of young
ladies, played some very choice selections,
after which dancine, singing and eames
were indulged in until midnight, when a
very elaborate su per was served.
At the supper table Golden Fox acted as
toast master of the evening. Mr. Bernard
McElroy of Oakland displayed his wit and
