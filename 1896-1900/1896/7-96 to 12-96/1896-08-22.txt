STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 21.â The gen
eral committee of the Native Sons held an
important meeting to-night, at which Otto
Grunsky of the entertainment committee
presided.
Chairman Gus G. Grant of the carnival
-ommittee reported that the principal
floats are now in course of construction.
A large storeroom has been secured in the
Yosemite Theater building and here the
materials to be used in the construction of
the barges and floats has been placed.
A line of lanterns will extend about Mc-
Leod's Lake for nearly a mile to the end
of the warehouse. Here a lightship, or
lighthouse will be stationed, and the pro
ces-ion on the water will turn at this
place. It will start in the lake, then move
west to the channel and down that to the
lightship. Along the banks lanterns will
be suspended every three feet, and eleven
large arc lights, with reflectors, and a
number of calcium lights will make the
water scene as bright as day. The largest
floats are now in process of construction
and the smaller ones will be completed
within a few days.
At intervals along the bank stations will
be placed, where, at a given signal, red
fire will be burned. The plans of the car
nival committee were approved to-night,
and it was tola to go ahead with itÃ work
on the lines mapped out.
Grand Marshal Nutter announced that
California Parlor would lead one of the
divisions and that W. D. Shea would De
the marshal in charge. Yosemite Parlor
will lead another division and George W.
Conway will be the marshal in charge.
Additional members were added to the
press committee to assist Chairman Henry
E. Adams, wno has thus far been very suc
cessful in the arrangements he has been
making for the newspaper men. Through
his efforts, George West <fc Co. of Â£l Pinal
vineyard, donated fifty cases of wine for
the represensatives of the press and has
besides promised, with others, a bountiiul
supply of vineyard products for the scribes
who will come here on Admission day.
The additional members of the committee
are: George Becker, J. J. Nunan, J. L.
Phelps, Irving Martin and R. B. Cullahan.
â¢The splendid arch across Hunter square
is rapidly assuming form, and its impos
ing appearance will add much to the deco
rations. Under it the Native Sons and
Daughters will pass in the parade, and
from its highest point the National colors
and the Bear flag will float, to be saluted
by the thousands who march in the great
parade.
On the south side of the arch stands the
figure of California in heroic size, holding
in one hand the furled colors and in the
other the wreath. The passageways are to
tbe right ana left ol the statue, and are
broad enough to allow fifteen men to walK
abreast. The height of the passageways
is forty feet, allowing ample room for the
floats.
The grand arch across Hunter Square, Stockton, as it will appear when completed. The view of the arch is taken
from the south side. The small picture in the upper right-hand corner, shows the bandstand on the north
side of the arch, which is under a monster shell to protect the musicians from the sun.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
The Last of the American Clipper Ship Willie Rosenfeld. "When 400 Miles Off the Coast of Brazil She Went Down Stern First in a Gale, and Fourteen of He?
Crew Are Missing. Shipping Men Think the Rosenfeld Sprang a Leak Off the Horn and That Captain Dunphy Was on His. Way Back , to. Rio de. Janeiro for
Repairs When the Catastrophe Happened* The Willie Rosenfeld Was Named After the Youngest Son of John Rosenfeld, the Park Commissioner of This City.
The Young Man Died a Few Days Before the Vessel Was Launched. In J894 the Ship Nearly Foundered When Rounding the Horn, and the Above Picture
Is From a Sketch Made at the Time.
On the north side of the arch is the band
stand, under a monster shell to protect the
musicians from the sun. On pedestals to
the side are three figures of California
grizzlies, with raised forepaws. As the
work now stands, it is but the skeleton of
what will be a great structure representing
mountain crags, dashing waterfalls, the
sheathed grain of the valleys and nuggets
of gold from the mountains. The main
structure alone stands over 100 feet from
the foundation and 150 feet in breadth.
The artist will find ample room on the
vast surface to fashion all the representa
tions of California wealth and types he
may desire.
All of the boathouses on McLeods Lake
and the channel were visited to-day by a
committee to see how many rowboats
were available for the night of the water
carnival. Last 3*ear there was difficulty
in engaging sufficient boats by those who

wished to view the carnival from the
water, but this year all this will be ob
viated, as hundreds of new boats have
been built since then and will be ready to
accommodate visitors on the night of the
water parade* Four extra barges have
been ordered for the singers and bands
that will take part in the water carnival.
All along the line of the parade on the
water? of the lake and channel the chor
uses of male singers will render the songa
they are now rehearsing. There will be
fully fifty bands here on Admission day to
take part in the parade, and all of these
will take position in the procession on the
water and lend their efforts to make the
affair the great success it now promises
to be.
It was suggested to-night that as Stock
ton had been advertised far and wide as
the coming railroad center on account of
being the terminal of the Valley road and
also of the road that connects this city
with the coal mine at Corral Hollow,
it would be well to see that both of these
roads, and more especially the Valley
road, assist in keeping up this idea by hav
ing a number of engines and trains on
hand during the celebration. It was sug
gested that as* the Valley road is to be so
great a factor in the future progress of
Stockton it have eight or more of its
locomotives steamed up and in running
order while che Natives are here, in order
that they may have some ocular demon
stration of the work done thus far'by the
Vallpy road officials. A committee con
sisting of Gus G. Grant, M. D. Eaton and
E. C. Wagner was appointed to see that
the representatives of both roads were in
terviewed on this subject.
The question of providing food for the
thousands who will be here was also dis
cussed. The committee on accommoda
tions reported that the churches of Stock
ton had promised to assist in feeding the
crowd of natives who will come here for
the festivities. The Central Methodist
Church has agreed to feed 500 visiting na
tives ior one day, the First Baptist Church
will provide for 100, the Congregational
church for 200, and St. John's Episcopal
Church 200 â making a thousand in all who
will be fed gratis by the churches.
To-morrow Gus G. Grant of the carni
val committee and Secretary Willy of the
general committee will visit San Fran
cisco for the purpose of conferring with
the general committee in San Francisco.
EMPLOYES ARE DETERMINED.
Unless Grievances Are Adjusted the Adams
Express Strike Will Extend Through
out the Country.
NEW YORK; N. V., Aug. 21.â A com
mittee representing the striking em
ployes of the 'Adams Express Company
has issued a statement regarding their
difficulties with the company. In it they
say the men are not striking for more
wages or less hours, but for a recognition
of their order, and to stop the indiscrimi
nate discharge of the employes of the
company without apparent reason. The
company, the statement goes on to say,
previous to the strike, discharged old
hand* as soon as the new ones were made
familiar with the work, paying them $50
per month, or $25 less than the amount
paid the old hands. The statement fur
ther says the president of the company
will again be requested by the strikers to
make tbe concession asked for, and if he
refuses, a general strike of Adams Ex
press employes throughout the country
will be ordered.
LOSS OF A. WOODEN SHIP.
The Governor Goodwin Goes Athore on
Princva Island.
BATA VIA, Java, Aug. 21.â The Ameri
can ship Governor Goodwin, Captain
Oakes, from New York April 29 for Chefoo,
is ashore on Princes Island, and is a total
wreck. The crew were all saved. The
Governor Goodwin was a wooden ship of
1459 tons, built in Boston, Mass., in 1877,
and owned by Foster & Pray oi Boston.
Eelip.ie of the Sun.
LONDON, Eng., Aug. 21.â Norman
Lockyer, the well-known astronomer and
editor of Nature, has written a letter to
the Times, in which he says the most ex
cellent observations of the recent total
eclipse of the sun we re obtained by Mr.
Shackelton. an astronomer who was con
veyed on Sir General Baden-Powell's
yacht, the Otaria, to Nova Zernbla. He
obtained a number of photographs whica
will go far to neutralize the failure of the
astronomical expeditions to Norway and
Japan.
Fatal Error of Judgment.
LONDON, Esq., Aug. 21.â The Field, in
its issue to-morrow will criticize what it
terms the hurried and inadequate inquest
into the death of Baron yon Zedwitz,
owner of the yacht Isolde, who was killed
on Tuesday "in a collision between that
boat and the German Emperor's yacht,
the Meteor. The paper ascribes the dis
aster to an error of judgment on the part
of those handling the Meteor.

FALSE REPORTS SCATTERED.
But Facts and Figures Show the
Popularity of the Repub lean
Standard-Bearer.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 21.â A dispatch
is being widely circulated in the Western,
Central and Southern States which con
tains an alleged letter from Canton, pur
porting to have been written in answer to
soru one who asks if it is true that Can.
ton Democrats have formed a large Bryan
silver club which contains many Repub
lican members. The letter in question
says:
â¢'lt is true we have in Canton a central
silver club with a membership of over
600, and three ward siiver clubs with a
large membership, blit just what it is I
am unable to say; and also in tne other
wards there will be organized silver
clubs. The central club has just been or
ganized ; it has an eminent Republican
for president and four vice-presidents, one
a Democrat, one a Republican, one a Pop
ulist and one a Prohibitionist, and the
club includes a large element of Repub
licans. Unless the tide turns McKinley
will not carry his ward, nor his city, nor
his Congressional district, and even there
is great probability of McKinley losing
the State."
This letter, which has been given wide
currency, has caused more than 200 letters
to be sent to the Republican committee
here, asking if the statements made in it
are tru9. Some of these letters have come
to Major McKinley. To-night one of the
leading Republicans of the county, Hon.
Hiram Doll, made a statement which is
officially approved and indorsed Dy the
chairman of the Republican County Com
mittee. Mr. Doll says:

SHE WENT DOWN
IN A HURRICANE.
The American Ship Willie
Rosenfeld Founders
at Sea.
FOURTEEN MEN MISSING
They Escaped in Two Boats, but
Have Not Been Heard
From Since.
THE HULL AND CARGO INSURED
Captain Dunphy Was Probably on His
Way Back to Rio When the
Ship Went Down.
Another marine disaster has to be re
corded. The American ship Willie Rosen*
feld foundered at sea some time this
month and fourteen of her crew are miss*
ing. The following telegrams announced
the news in this City:
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 21.â The American
ship Willie Rosenfeld, from Mew York for Saa
Francisco, is reported as having foundered 400
miles off Santa Catharina. Fourteen people
are missing.
LONDON, E.vo., Aug. 21.â A cablegram from
Santa Catbarina says that the American ship
Willie Rosenfeld, from New York for San Fran*
Cisco, foundered 400 miles off the coast. Part
of the crew was saved and landed. Two boats,
containing fourteen persons, are missing.
The first news of the loss of the ship
was received here by Williams, Dimond <fc
Co., to whom the vessel was consigned.
They received the information from Dear*
born Â£ Co. of New York*, and at once no
tified the underwriters. The loss on ves
sel and cargo will probably amount to
$750,000, and the insurance is in the neigh
borhood of $500,000. The Willie Rosenfeid
was a home ship, and nearly all the risks
on her were held in San Francisco. This
makes the fifth Al vessel that insurance
has been paid on within the past five
weeks. The City of Philadelphia was lost
when rounding the Horn; the Colombia
went ashore at Pigeon Point and the St.
Paul at Point Pinos; a British ship with a
cargo for San Francisco is posted at Lloyds
as missing, and now comes the foundering
of the Willie Rosenfeld. In the short
space of time mentioned the insurancs
companies must have lost over a million
and a half.
The Willie Rosenfeld was well known in
San Francisco. She was named after the
youngest son of John Rosenfeld, but the
young man died before the vessel was
launched. Captain William H. Dunphy,
who was in command of her, is the father
in-law of Henry Rosenfeld, and during
her eleven years of Jife the vessel has al
most always traded between New York
and San Francisco, She left here last
year and made a quick run to New York,
but there was considerable delay in get
ting away again, as the sailors had the
captain and officers arrested for cruelty on
the high seas. Dunphy was exonerated,
but the mates were held to answer.
This delayed the sailing, and it was not
until April 23 last that the vessel got
away. John Rosenfeld was at that time
in New York, and he went all over the
ship. He reports that she was well found
and as sound as the day she was launched.
The opinion of seafaring men is that the
Rosenfeld made a fast run to the Horn and
there was caught in a hurricane, rier
sails were blown from the bolt ropes, top
masts went by the board, the bowsprit
snapped off short and the hull began to
leak. Finding that the water was gaining
in the hold Captain Dunphy probably put
about and ran back for Rio de Janeiro.
Another storm must have caught tha ill
fated ship and, her seams opening up, she
went down stern first.
"Captain Dunphy must have been on
his way back to Rio," said Captain James
F. Chapman yesterday. "If he had been
making for the Horn he would have been
much closer inshore, but if he was run
ning for a port in which to repair he was
on his course when the vessel foundered.
Judging from the meager details she was
in latitude 37.30 south, longitude 48.30
west, an 1 would therefore be between
Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro. At the
former place there is not good anchorage
for a vessel the size of the Rosenfeld, and
at the latter there are facilities for repairs
of all kind. Of course no one can tell
how the thing happened, but when full
particulars arrive I think you will find
that the Willie Rosenfeld was on her way
to Rio in distress."
This is not the first occasion on which
the ship in question was in distress. She
left here on December 25, 1894, and very
nearly foundered off the Horn. On .that
occasion she lost nearly a suit of sails and
the vessel was practically a wreck. Two
of the crew were killed and eight were in
jured while attemptine to clear away the
wreckage. Captain Dunphy had his leg
broken and the first mate was injured.
On that occasion she nearly went down
stern first, and the accompanying cut is
reproduced from a sketch made by one of
the sailors. Twice was the Willie Rosen
feld in jeopardy at the Horn and on both
occasions she settled aft. The third time
was fatal and she went down stern first.
The Willie Rosenfeld was built in Bath,
Me., in 1885, and was one of the stoutest
ships ever turned out by Arthur Sewall <fc
Co. She was 2455 tons gross burden, 268
feet 5 inches long, 44 feet 8 inches broad
and 19 feet 1 inch deep. Captain Dunphy
had been in command of her from the
time she went into commission.
As to the missing members of the crew
no one seems to know anything. The
supposition is that Captain Dunphy and
tourteen or fifteen men have got ashore at
Santa Catbarina in a lifeboat, and that the
other boats with seven men in each made
a landing farther south. Very few of the
men were from San Francisco, as nearly
all who joined her here left her in New
YorK. The Rosenfeld was known as a
"bard ship," and sailors as a rule are hot
sorry that she is gone so long as they art
satisfied no lives were lost.2

America.
SARATOGA, IS. V., Aug. 21.â When tne
American Bar Association convened at
10:30 o'clock this morning on their con
cluding day's session, the first business
taken ud was the election of officers for the
ensuing year. The officers elected were as
follows: President, James M. Woolworth
of Omaha, Xebr. ; secretary, John Hinkley
of Baltimore; treasurer, Francis Rawle of
Philadelphia; executive committee â Al
fred Hemenway, Boston; Charles Clattin
Allen, St. Louis; William W. Howe, New
OrJeans.
A vice-president for every State in the
Union, and members composing the local
council in each State, were also elected.
The report of the executive committee
relative to the establishment of a section
on insurance, as proposed by Judge Howe
of New Orleans, which was passed over
yesterday, was taken up. It was lost by a
vote of 85 to 23.
General E. F. Bullard of N,ew York
moved the following:
Fesolved, That It be referred to the commit
tee on jurisprudence and law reform the ques
tion whether the law in regard to fellow
servants should not be so amended as to
further protect laboring men from the result
of negligence caused by persons untcnown to
them and over whom they have no control.
Carried by a vote of 81 to 27.
A resolution was adopted providing that
the committee on jurisprudence and law
reform be requested to report to the as
t-embJy the best method of preventing the
enactment of hasty and slipshod legisla
tion in general and has laws.
Emil McClain of lowa City moved "that
the American Bar Association approve
the lengthening of a course of instruction
in law schools to a period of three years,
and that it express the hope that as soon
as practicable a rule be adopted in each
State whicn will require candidates for
admission to the bar to study law for three
years before applying for examination."
This was adopted without debate.
Invitations were received from Saratoga,
Indianopolis and Denver for the associa
tion to meet in 1897. Referred to the
executive committee.
The association finished its labors at
11 :45 o'clock and adjourned sine die.
At 3:30 o'clock this afternoon the clos
ing session on the section of legal educa
tion was held, Emil McClain of lowa pre
siding. Austin G. Fox of New York read
v paper on "Two Years' Experience of
the New York State Board of Law Ex
aminers."
J. W. Powell of Washington presented
a paper on "Study of Primitive Institu
tions."
At the conclusion of the papers and
during the discussion which followed Lord
Russell, who occupied a seat on the plat
form, arose, and after referring to the
paper of Major Powell, said with reference
to the paper of Mr. Fox of New York:
"I, perhaps, am better able to offer some
observations upon the paper of my friend,
Air. Fox. I think it cannot be donbted
that as justice and its administration are
among the prime needs and business of
life so is it important that those charged
with the administration of the law, which
is devoted to doing justice, should come
to tne important duties that they have to
discharge adequately equipped for the
purpose. As you are aware there exists in
Great Britain a distinction which does not
exist here. Each member of the bar is, I
think, properly de3crit>ed in this country
as counselor and attorney. In Great Brit
ain there is the most marked line of dis
tinction drawn. The attorney is not a mem
ber of the bar; a member of the bar is not
an attorney, and the great feature of dis
tinction is this, that the attorney is
the person who sees the client,
who in the first instance advises the client,
who prepares the statements of facts and
arranges for the evidence necessary to
support the facts which are to establish a
particular right, or which affords an an
swer to the adverse assertion of some
right.
"I would like, before 1 sit down, to be
allowed to express the admiration I feel,
not for the constitution of this congress of
United States lawyers, but for the scheme
of its operation and the wise purpose to
which ft devotes its efforts. Its work is
not new to me. I have had the pleasure
of seeing now for some years tne record of
its proceedings, ana it is to me as it was
on hearing the admirable presidential ad
dress which was delivered on Wednesday
in # the highest degree refreshing
to hod that the profession of the law in
this country is so earnestly alive to the re
sponsibilities of its position, ie so keen to
observe, to weigh, to judge, discriminate,
to test the current of judgment and of
legislation, and above all it keeps before
Useif steadfastly and unceasingly a high
Ideal, not merely of what ought to be the
mental equipments ana the acquirement
in learning, but the high moral character
of the profession to which they belong."
Lord Russell and party sat for their
pnotographs at the United States Hotel
to-day. Afterward they were photo
graphed at the studio of a prominent
firm.

S A.RATOGA, N. V., Aug. 21.â The social
side of the annual conference of the
American Bar Association found a most
auspicious close in the nineteenth annual
banquet held this evening in the ballroom
of the Grand Union Hotel, and which was
attended by 260 members of the legal fra
ternity. From 7 until 8 o'clock a recep
tion was held in the reception-room of the
hotel where Lord Russell of Killoween,
i-ord Chief Justice of England; Sir Frank
Lockwood and Montague Crackanthorpe
Â»â¢'â¢Â« thÂ« a-uests of the evening. At 8
o'clock Lord Russell and Chauncey M.
Depew, under the leadership of Francis
Rawley of Philadelphia, treasurer of the
Bar Association, proceeded to the ball
room of the hotel, where the banquet was
served. At the guests' table were seated
Chaunney M. Depew, who presided. At
his right sat Lord Russell, and at his left
United States Supreme Court Judge Rufus
Peckham and President of the Bar Asso
ciation, James M. Woolworth of Omaha.
At the close of the dinner Mr. Depew in
in a few well-chosen words introduced
Lord Russell as the guest of the evening
and his Lordship in a brief address proved
that he was equally as well at home as an
after-dinner speaker as on the bench.
The toast "The Bar Association" was
responded to by President James W.
Woolworth of Omaha) in an able manner.
Sir Frank Lockwood" of England, the peer
of after-dinner speakers of that country,
was next introduced and in an address
which abounded with humor and wit
captivated his guests. His toast was con
fined to the English bar and most ably did
the distinguished jurist respond for it.
Morefield Storey of Boston then spoke as
the retiring president. To James Beck of
Philadelphia was accorded the honor of
speaking for the junior bar. The last
speaker of the evening was Bourke
Cockran.

The ex-Republican mentioned as presi

most enthusiastic McKinley men in the
city, and during the greatest jollification
meetings here after the St. Louis conven
tion, rode at the head of each procession
escorting the various delegations to Gov

for chief marshal of the Escort Club, but
faiied of election. Immediately after that
he turned over to the opposition.
â¢'The Silver Club at its organization was
only claimed to have a membership of 200
to 250 upon the statements of its officials
to the press associations. When it is re
membered that Stark County has a popu

A poll of the precinct that Major McKin

Hubbard Reports the Silver lide Re-
ceding in Minnesota.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 21.â 1t was a
quiet day at National headquarters so far
as it related to news for tne public and
distinguished visitors. National Com
mitteeman Hubbard came in from his
State (Minnesota) and reported the silver
tide receding before the avalanche of gold
literature and the argument of abie
speakers.
The colored Republican headquarters
was opened for business to-aay. Profes
sor R. C. Greener, ex-secretary of the
Grant Memorial Association, is one of the
officials in charge. Their quarters are on
the thirteenth floor of the Auditorium
building, and Professor Greener smilingly
remarked to-day, by way of explanation of
the altitudious offices, that importunate
colored gentlemen had been so numerous
outside of Mr. Hanna's office when the
chairman came to town the location of the
bureau would draw them away ana break
their fall.
The wheelmen's organization ha 3 also
been moved to the floor with the unlucky

Earnest at Tivoli
Town.
IT IS WELL ADVERTISED
So a Big Crowd Is Expected
to Turn Out at the
Meeting.
GOING TO WINNISOOK LODGE.
Senator Hill Said to Have Some Con
nection With the Visit to M jor
Hinkley.
UPPER RED HOOK, N. V., Aug. 21.â
The Bryan and Sewall campaign will be
opened in earnest to-morrow at Tivoli,
this county, by Mr. Bryan. With the ex
ception of his Madison-square address,
the speech he will deliver, it is said, will
be the most important of his utterances
since his nomination. For tbe first time
he will deal directly with the issues of the
campaign. The meeting has been largely
advertised and a big crowd is expected.
Mr. Bryan's visit to Major James W.
Hinkley, chairman of the New York State
Democratic Committee, will be made on
Monday. As to the import 01 the meeting
between Major Hinkley and himself Mr.
Bryan is uncommunicative.
It is likely that Mr. Bryan will spend
Monday night at Winnisook Lodge in the
Catskills, where Major Hinkley is sum
mering, and tbe two will have every op
portunity to discuss the situation in
detail. Major Hinkley, wbiie one of the
gold leaders at the Chicago convention,
has been non-committal since Bryan's
nomination, and his invitation to tbe can
didate is looked on as positive proof that
he will support the ticket. The signifi
cant part of Mr. Bryan's visit to Winni
sook Lodge lies in the belief that Major
Hinkley is acting for Senator Hill, and
tbe claim is made that it foreshadows the
Senator's action at the Buffalo conven
tion.
A rumor was brought here to-day that
Senator Hill would attend the Bryan
meeting in Albany Tuesday night, where
the candidate will make a speech, but it
could not be confirmed through Mr. Bryan
or any other source.
A fishing fever took possession of Mr.
Bryan again to-day. With Mr. and Mrs.
Perrine, their daughter and some friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan drove out to Spring
Lake, a couple of miles from Upper Red
Hook, to try their luck with the rod. Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan rowed off to a secluded
part of the lake, and while Mrs. Bryan
fished, her husband produced paper and
pencil and devoted himself to writing.
Neither he nor Mrs. Bryan would say what
he was composing, but everybody knew it
was his letter of acceptance.
The party reached Upper Red Hook at
dark, tired and Hungry. Mr. Bryan found
Congressman William Sulzer from New
York awaiting him. With Mr. Sulzer was
Professor Van Burr Dinslow, who formerly
occupied tbe chair of political economy at
Chicago University, and is now a writer
on economics generally. Mr. Sulzer and
Professor Dinslow spent an hour at Mr.
Perrine's house with Mr. Bryan.
WAST BRYAN TO TALK.
Chairman Jones Receives Applications
for a J.oan of the Orator,
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 21. â Chairman
Jones of the Democratic National Com
mittee was busy all day to-day receiving
visitors from outside Chicago, most of
whom wanted to get Mr. Bryan to speak
in their States, and home talent was fre
quently offered in exchange, but the Sen
ator would make no definite promises or
fix dates until the nominee arrives in
Chicago September 4. Charles A. Walsh,
secretary of the National Committee, was
in Ottumwa, lowa, to-day, but he wired
Committeeman Johnson that he would be
in Chicago to-morrow.
Senator Jones said Major Towles would
probably be appointed chairman of
the campaign committee. He also an
nounced that Messrs. Campau, Johnson,
Gahan, Walsh and nimsetf would manage
tbe campaign from Chicago headquarters,
and Messr?. McLean, Howell and Smalley
from the Washington headquarters.
Dan McConville of Ohio, who will have
charee of the speaker's bureau, will arrive
to-morrow to begin worK. Mr. Campau
returned to*night to his Michigan home,
as his presence is required at tbe State
convention in Bay City next Tuesday.
After that event he will return
to headquarters to remain until the
votes have decided the battle. He said the
people of Michigan were waiting for the
promised letter of Mr. Pingree on the
money question.
"SILVER DICK" ON DECK,
Given a Big Reception During a Visit to
Maryland.
BALTIMORE, Md., Aug. 21.â "Silver
Dick" Bland was given a big reception at
Laurel this evening, and the meeting
which he subsequently addressed was the
largest in numbers held there in recent
years. Mr. and Mrs. Bland arrived from
Washington at 5 o'clock as the guests of
Ernest P. Baldwin, Auditor of the Treas
ury. A public reception followed a din
ner, and afterward a torchlight procession
was formed and marched through the
streets of Laurel to Laurel Grove, where a
great crowd had preceded the marchers.
President Baldwin of the Laurel Demo
cratic Club called the meetine to order,
and Mayor Phelps introduced Mr. Bland.
He discussed unlimited coinage, eulogized
Messrs. Bryan and Bewail and the Chi
cago platform, and admonished his hear
ers to beware of goldbue influence.
AIXJBTI COUNTIES REPRESENTED.

State Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 21.â Reports re
ceived at Illinois gold Democratic head
quarters from the counties of the State

there to-day was a great success, and there
would be a complete delegation to the
convention.
Ex-National Committeeman Cable tele
graphed that he would head the Kock
Ibland County delegation to-day, thus
disproving the reports that he bad backed
out of tne movement.
FLOWER SCORES BRYAN.
â Inconsistencies in the JS'eto Xorh Speech
forcibly Pointed Out.
WATERTOWN, N. V., Aug. 21.â Ex-
Governor Flower was elected president of
the Sound Money Democratic Club at its
meeting to-night. The organization has
over 150 members. In his speech of ac
ceptance Governor Flower discussed a
point in Mr. Bryan's recent deliverance
which has not been touched upon by
others. He said :
"I want to cail your attention to a part
of Mr. Bryan's recent speech in New York
in which he unconsciously discloses his
character. To allay apprehensions of the
debtor that free-silver legislation might
not be enacted before the creditor could
call in his loan or foreclose his mortgage,
Mr. Bryan says: 'If in November the
people declare themselves in favor of the
immediate restoration of bimetallism, the
system can be inaugurated within a few
mouths.' This, he says, fan be done by
virtue of the President's power to conveno
Congress in extraordinary session. The
debt-payer said: 'How shall I be able to
pay my debts at the rate of 53 cents on the
dollar, since it will take thirteen months
at least to enact the necessary legislation,
and in that time my creditor will have
been able to cail in my loan or foreclose
his mortgage?'
"Mr. Bryan reassures him and next ap
peals to his dishonesty by saying: 'Just
as soon as I am President I will rush the
system through before the creditor has a
chance to call in his loan or foreclose his
mortgage.' Why this hurry, Mr. Bryan?
Obviously you believe in the debasement
of the dollar which will allow the dis
honest debtor to repudiate his debts, And
how does Mr. Bryan reconcile this with
the assertion in a prior part of his speech
that free coinage will raise the
price of silver bullion to $1 29
per ounce, measured by gold? He
cannot reconcile tbe two statements, be
cause if the former is true then there would
be no need for hurrying, because the
debtor would not be benefited if silver goes
to a par with gold. But that Mr. Bryan
knows that nis previous assertion is false
and that silver will not advance is shown
by his latter assurance that the system
will be inaugurated before the creditor has
a chance to collect what is owing to him.
I should think this man would fear to ex
pose himself to a people whose honor he
so grossly insults by offering them a bribe
of 47 cents on each dollar of their indebt
edness."
ADDRESSED BY BINUM.
Gold Standard Democrats Rally in
Force at Peoria.
PEORIA, 111., Aug.2Lâ The gold-stand
ard Democrats of Peoria met this evening
in one ot tbe largest and most enthusiastic
gatherings ever held in this city. Ex-
Congressman Bynuru of Indiana was the
speaker of the evening and he delivered a
strong argument in advocacy of gold as
the basis of tbe country's financial sys
tem.
At the conclusion of his speech resolu
tions were adopted condemning the action
of tbe Chicago convention on the money
question; approving the action of leading
Democrats in calling another convention
to place another ticket in the field; de
claring the success of the Chicago nomi
nees would sound the death-knell of the
Democratic party; denouncing the refusal
to commend the administration of Presi
dent Cleveland and the attack on civil
service and the Federal judiciary, and de
claring for a sound and stable currency.
Delegates were then chosen to attend
the State convention at Chicago and tbe
meeting adjourned. Several other speak
ers booked to make addresses failed to ap
pear.
Many Zetters for Bryan.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Aug. 21.â When Mr.
Bryan returns home he will find a stacK
of letters several feet high awaiting him.
Private Secretary Schwind % is disposing of
these missives, which come from every
part of the globe, as fast as they arrive.
Many of them are from reputable business
men, bankers and lawyers, but a good
share are of the cranky variety, offering
absurq* suggestions as to the management
of the campaign. Not a few of the letters
naively suggest that when the victory is
won the writer wishes the nominee to re
member that he is a candidate for such
and such an office.
Bryan's Silver Notification,

Georee E. Groot, chairman of the silver

Silver Democratic Leaders Make Pe*
culiar Admissions Regarding
the S-ntiment.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 2L-Sena
tor Bacon of Georgia, having just returned
from an extended trip through the West,
visited the headquarters of the Democratic
Congressional Committee this morning
and reported to his fellow Democrats that
the tide of the silver sentiment on the Pa
cific Coast did not appear to recede. Sen
ator Bacon's opinions were eiven before a
company of press correspondents, and it
was easy enough to perceive that, despite
his professions of confidence that "the
coast is all right," he was apprehensive
that all was not well.
"The great danger," said he, "is that
Republicans, by their liberal use of cam
paign funds, may be able to accomplish a
widespread and generous distribution of
literature bearing on the money question.
A great many people on the silver side of
this controversy ara not very well in
formed."
This very frank admission of the ig
norance of free-silver Democrats was re
freshing. Senator Bacon's statement can
only be construed as an admission of fear
that when the masses are educated by
means of the sound-money literature now
being sent into every voting precinct of
the country they may cast their votes for
the Republican ticket.
Senator Bacon declares that a great pro
portion of the masses are free silver men
"by instinct" and not always able to put
tip an argument in support of their politi
cal affiliations. Mr. Bacon said he had
seen "clumps" of men, in the streets, hotel
lobbies and other public places, wherever
he went, all deeply absorbed in the dis
cussion of the money question. Bacon
further said:
"Now, sometimes a pretty good silver
man will undertake to argue his case,
when, by reason of not being supplied
with literature, he is not able to sustain
his siae of the argument as well as some
fellow on the other side who has been
supplied with ammunition by Republican
document agencies and newspapers. The
latter is likely to make the best impression
on the street-corner audience. It is very
apparent to me that Republicans, through
their abundant campaign funds, will be
able to accomplish a vast deal of good in
the gold money cause by the dissemina
tion of gold money literature."
The convention of the sound-money
Democrats, or "Mr. Bynum's convention"
as it is familiarly known, to be held at
Indianapolis on September 2, is beginning
to attract some attention in Washington.
Senator Palmer's interview, telegraphed
from Springfield, expressing belief that
the convention would not put a new ticket
in the field, hut wouid adjourn after
adopting a platform, excited a good deal
of comment to-day and created surprise,
for it has been the general understanding
that a third ticket would be nominated,
with the probability that General Palmer
would be the Presidential nominee. The
interview is calculated to discourage ad
vocates of a thfrd ticket, especially those
who have been advising the nomination
of Palmer. It is suspected by some shrewd
polititians, however, that General Palmer,
in order to avoid the accusation of selfish
interest in the bolt of gold men, is playing
the part of a coy maiden who must be
persuaded.
Singularly enough, and notwithstand
ing the general impression that the In
dianapolis convention would seek to nom
inate a Western man for President, the
name of Bourke Cockran has been con
jured with since his great speech at
Madison-square Garden. But this talk
was only indulged in by the street-corner
politicians, who did not appear to know
that Bourke is an alien. He was born in
Ireland and is therefore ineligible.
One of the amusing suggestions is Eckels,
the Comptroller, for the third party nomi
nation. He hails from the right geographi
cal section of the country â Illinois â and is
one of President Cleveland's favorite little
sons. Eckels has a glib sound-money
tongue and is regarded as a wonderful
stump speaker. It would, indeed, be a
strange spectacleâ that of two boy orators
running for the Presidency. This sugges
tion of Eckels' nomination is, of course,
not to be taken seriously. Though un
doubtedly a young man of splendid char
acter and ability, his physical appearance,
if nothing else, would preclude his nomi
nation. He looks like a callow youth of 20.
A close friend of Mr. Cleveland said to
The Call correspondent to-night that the
President favored the nomination of a
third ticket and that he preferred General
Palmer of Illinois as the nominee.
RAILROADS REDUCING FORCES.
Men in the Freight-Handling Departments
Laid Off Because of Dull
Business.
NEW YOKK, N. V., Aug. 21,-The Her
ald says :
Following closely upon the action of the
Pennsylvania Railroad in making reduc
tions in its fcrces, aa well as in the hours
of work, several of the other big railroads
leading out of New York have issued no
tices to mate retrenchments. This action
is chiefly due to the falling off in freight
brought about by the uncertainties of the
business situation. Officials say that ship
pers appear to be limiting themselves to
the necessities of the next three months,
and are apparently awaiting the outcome
of the election.
The New York Central, while not laying
off men to so great an extent as the Penn
ey lvania, nas dispensed with many men
in the freight-train service as well as some
of the handlers in the principal yards be
tween here and Buffalo. A large number
of the freight trains are made up only as
they are wanted, and hence there are nat
urally many idle crews when the freight
movement slackens much, as is the case at
present. Tiie chief engineer's force, both
in the office and in the field, has been re
duced 20 to 25 per cent.
Third Vice-president Webb denied yes
terday that there would be any general
reduction in forces. "There is no inten
tion," he said, "of making retrenchments
apply to all departments. Strict economy
has been practiced for some time in every
department, but the present reductions
apDly mainly to the fr,eighj-train service,
where men are employed only as they are
needed to handle the traffic. * When busi
ness is light, as is the case at the present
time, some of the men are laid off."
Vice-President Mellen of the New York,
;Â«ew Haven and Hartford Railroad issued
an order to make all possible retrench
ments in every branch of the operating
department consistent with the efficient
handling of business. Scores of men are
thrown out of work. The reduction in
expenses was due to the falling off in
freight.
The New Jersey Central has reduced its
freight-train force slightly to conform to
the smaller volume of business, but it will
not make any general cut in other depart*
meats.
I (Second Vice-President Merrill of the
Erie said yesterday tiiat his company will
not make any so-called retrenchments,
after the fashion of some roads. The road
is always run as economically as possible,
regardless of whether business is dull or
flourishing.
â¢ The same principle applies to the Dela
ware, Lackawanna and Western and West
Shore as to the Erie, and few discharges
are expected. Expenses on these roads
have been kept down to the lowest limit
since the panic of 1893.
All railroad officials who expressed an
opinion about the matter agreed that the
present financial agitation was wholly re
sponsible for the falling off in business.
HIS DESPERATE RESOLVE
A Young Man Drowns Himself
by Clinging to a Sub
merged Root.
The Comb n d Strength of Five Men
R quired to Loosen His Death
Grip.
DE FUNIAK, Fla., Aug. 21.-One of
the most tragic sucides on record in this
part of the country was that of Frederick
Higeinbotham, a young Englishman,
which took place last Wednesday after
noon.
Higginbotham was boating with a party
of friends on the Yellow Kiver. They had
stopped at a raft and, as the day was
warm, had gone in bathing. The party
was a lively one and Higcinbotham was
in high spirits. Suddenly, in the midst
of the fun, he sprang on the raft and turn
ing to his companions shouted: "Good
by, boys; I am going to hell!" Then he
dived into the water.
At first it was thought that he was in
fun and no attention was paid to him.
But when he did not come to the surface
tbe others peered down into the water and
saw him clinging to a root and
deliberately drowning himself. His
companions jumped into the water and
tried to loosen hi 3 hold, but in vain.
Then after some delay a rope was pro
cured, was fastened around his legs, and
an effort made to tear him free, but so
desperate was the grip that it took the
strength of five men to pull him up. He
was unconscious at that time, and
although a doctor was at once summoned,
it was found to be impossible to resusci
tate him.
Higginbotham was about 25 years of
age, but bad led a fa3t life. He was tbe
son of wealthy parents in England, and
had been sent to the United States several
years ago in the hope o: breaking up his
associations with evil characters. He re
ceived a handsome remittance from Lon
don every month. The attempt to reform
him had been vain. He had merely trans
ferred the scene of his dissipations from
one side of tbe Atlantic to the other: and
his tragio death was undoubtedly the re
salt of his excesses.
DACING BASK ROBBERT.
Zarge Sum of Money Taken in Broad
T> ay light,
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 21.â The
stockyards branch of tbe American Na
tional Bank, located on the second floor
of the Livestock Exchange, was robbed of
$3000 in cash this morning. Cashier Bos
well, in charge of the bank, secured $2000
from the main institution this morning
and going to the Exchange building placed
the money in a drawer under tbe counter,
as is his custom. Having a letter to de
liver on the floor below he went down
stairs, leaving the door of the banking
room open.
When he returned he found tbe money-*
drawer open, a jimmy having been used,
and tbe bills all taken. The marks of the
nails in the shoes of the thief were seen
where he jumped the counter in making
his escape. There were hundreds of men
on the floor below when the robbery oc
curred, but the hallways of the second
floor were practically deserted.
Moonshiners Captured,
BRISTOL, Term., Aug. 21.â A party
of twenty-six revenue officers, repre
senting all sections of Virginia, went to
Franklin County yesterday to break up
the most noted band of outlaws and
illicit distillers in that State. By artifice
they succeeded in capturing twelve of the
outlaws without bloodshed and destroy
ing several stills. Among the captured
were Calvin Moore, tbe Martin brothers
and tbe Atkins brothers, the leading
spirits of the gang.
While coming out of the mountains
the officers were fired on at different
points, and in one instance waged a tierce
fight on the would-be ambushers, driving
them back.

TILLMAN TALKS
FOR FREE SILVER,
Makes an Address to the
Farmers at Mount
Gretna.
SCOLDS HIS OPPONENTS
Grover Cleveland Classed as a
Bag of Beef Afraid to Do
Anything.
BOURKE COCKRAN ANSWERED
The South Carolina Senator Runs
Rampant While on the Money
Question.
MOUNT GRETNA, Pa., Aug. 21.-Sena
tor Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina
made an address here to-day for free sil
ver to the farmers gathered around the
Mount Gretna Agricultural Fair. About
500 people, mostly farmers, made up Sena
tor Tillman's audience. The speaker was
given respectful attention and was fre
quently applauded. Senator Tillman said:
We are face to face with a crisis. We passed
through two or three other crises in our Gov
ernment. One was in 1832, when Jackson
throttled the same money devil. He took it
by the throat and stood there, a bulwark be
tween the masses and the classes. He vetoed
the United States bank act [applause], and
there was your Democrat; not like the bag of
beef now in the White House, whose only ve
toes have been that of the seigniorage bill for
the relief of the people and some tour pension
bills to get a lew dollars out of tne treasury.
To-day there is not an article which enters
into every-day consumption in any consider
able amount througn which tribute is not
levied on you by some corporation, or trust,
or monopoly; making the rich man richer and
the poor man poorer. We have laws on our
statute-books prohibiting combinations and
.monopolies and trusts, but Secretary Olney,
who was himself a corporation attorney, can
not find one to bring a lawsuit tinder, and his
predecessor under Harrison did not do any
better.
I have tbe greatest admiration and respect
for Mr. McKinleyâ that is, I have as much ad
miration for him as I can have lor any man
who is badly off, who is wrong, so benighted,
so lost in the wilderness of ignorance. Mc-
Kinley will not utter anything unless it has
been submitted to Hanna or to some other
boss. That's what they say aoout it, yet I may
be mistaken, but Isay circumstantial evidence
would indicate that Bryan speaks right out.
I believe Bryan is honest and true, and
being honest and true, he is not going to say
or do anything that is going to hurt him or
his case. We have these two men before us in
that public attitude. One is to-day before the
people, not too great a man to shako hands
even with a coal heaver, and the other is too
high, like Grover Cleveland, who surrounds
himself by detectives to protect himself from
assassination.
Senator Tillman then went into an elab
orate discussion and exposition of the
money question. He then proceeded to
answer the recent address by Bourke Cock
ran, which he pronounced to be an effort
to array the wage-workers against the
farmers. The Senator was very emphntic
that sectionalism did not enter into the
money question. He continued:
Will you submit to English domination?
We whipped England in 1776, we whipped
her in 1812, and we can whip her to-day with
one hand tied. Think whether you will again
have Pierpont Morgan and his gang of ghouls
In Wall street to govern and have dominion
over our President and Congress, or whether
you will free us and restore our majesty as
American free men. Tell your party to go to
the devil unless it is going to do what is right.
With this blunt ending the Senator con
cluded his speech and sat down. Con
gressman Turner of New York also made
a silver speech.

Los Gatos, Cal., Aug. 2L J
About 1000 people visited the field of
â ham battle nere this morning. Spectators
perched on the tops of houses and sur
rounding hills, just as they did at the battle
of Bunker Hill, one day long years ago.
There was, however, no General Putnam
to leave his plow and come to the rescue
of his countrymen, but in the battle of
Los Gatos Captain Filmer did his best to
emulate the patriot of old.
The battle, though sham, was eearnestt t
and many a guardsman's heart leaped
with excitement as he paused at the first
discharge of guns. The boys went into
action with a dash and vim that promise
well for more serious ene.ieements. The
wounded and dead did iÂ»ot strew the
ground as thick as autumn leaves in a
hardwood country. Both the dead and
the wonnded were quickly resuscitated
with a swig of water from a canteen and a
palm-leaf fan in the hands of Surgeon Mc-
Culloch.
The battle took place in a stubble-field
at the side of the San Jose road, on the
outskirts of Los Gatos. It afforded natural
advantages for a sham battle. There was
a broad, open, level stretch of ground, and
at the south end of the field rose a knoll of
considerable size. Beyond was a little
valley, and then the field rose toward the
mountains in a gentle slope, covered with
grapevines.
The company was divided into two
platoons, the reds and the blues. One
platoon lay on their shirtfronts in the
level field, while the other was prone in
the same position on the farther slopÂ© of
the hill. Their hats and eyebrows could
be seen just over the summit, and their
long rifles, which belched flame 'and
smoke, were pointed over the brow of the
hill at the enemy.
A shrill whistle by Captain Filmer was
the signal for the battle to begin. The
object of tne engagement was to dislodge
tiie section th3t was supposed to be pick
ins off the men in the field. The larger
body of troops was that in the open. Their
work was admirable. They ran forward
in sections, dropped to their knees and
discharged their pieces at the hats peeping
over the top of the hill. Another squad
would be ordered forward, and while it
was running to a position about fifteen
yards in front the section that had jnst
fired would reload and, in turn, run for
ward and fire again. There were three of
such sections. Sometimes they advanced
together and, at command, fired simul
taneously.
Captain Filmer, First Lieutenant Stur
devant and Second Lieutenant Baumm
were much in evidence on the field, their
ewords glittering in the sun. Corporal
Kelly ano Corporal Taylor and Corporal
Sullivan and the entire company fought
nobly.
"Charge !" cried Captain Filmer.
Swinging their guns in the air and
yelling liKe a lot of Comanches, the troops
made a dash for the top of the hill. They
were met with volley aftex volley from the
guns of the little force entrenched there,
and in the face of such a fire they were
compelled to turn and retreat. Some of
the boys made it more realistic by jump
ing over a fence which stood in their path
of retreat.
Three eeparate times did the main body
of troops charge the hill, but were com
pelled to fail back by the severe fire of
musketry.
The fourth and last assault was irre
sistible. With bayonets gleaming and
voices raised in gallant shouts the troops
ran rapidly ap the I: 111 and carried the
position. The enemy retreated on the
double quick, every man for himself down
the other slope, across the valley and took
refuge in the clumps of grapevines, and
from this cover kept up a scattering fire.
The position and the victory were not
won witnout loss, however. The first
noble soldier to bite the dust and permit
his Springfield to fall to earth was Van
Eieberst.
He did not stop at falling. He rolled
over until he reached the bottom of the
hill, where he lay for about thirty seconds
before the surgeon arrived with his palm
leaf fan and a canteen of warm water. He
was revived with great difficulty and pro
crastination, the mason being that the
wounded man insisted on arguing that
tepid water was not the proper drink to
bring a man to life with. He was finally
borne off the field supported by a rifle and
tne sho ulders of two of his weeping com
rades.
Another gallant soldier who fell at the
top of the hill and rolled until his progress
was stopped by a pebble was Guardsman
Ostboff. He and another man complete
ihe tint of maimed and wounded. Both
rerolutely showed not a sign of life till
the surgoon arrived with that canteen in
which ttiey expected to find â anything
but water.
At the top of the hill the platoon that
won it waved their hats and cheered.
There were a few answering shots from the
erapevines on the hill. Then all was still,
and the shnm battle of Los Gatos, August
21, 1896, A. D., had passed into history.
To-night the grand ball tendered by the
citizens of Los Gatos and managed by the
Board of Trade, took place at Masonic
Hall. The hall was attractive!}' decorated
in red, white and blue, at one end were
these words in letters of the National
colors: "Welcome Company B." Cut
flowers, potted plants, palms and ferns
ornamented the piatform and ends of the
hall. There were nineteen numbers on
the dancing programme. The grand
march was led by Captain and Mrs. Fil
mer. All the members of Company B
were relieved from duty this evening that i
they might attend the ball, except one
man, who was left on guard.
T. E. Johns was floor manager and the
committee of arrangements comprised R.
F. Kobertson, William A. Pepper, J. D.
Beggs, George H. Adams and T. E. Johns.
There was a large attendance. President
Â£Â R. Bell of the Board of Trade made an
audress of welcome. He said:
'â¢We are assembled here this evening for
the purpose of entertaining our honored
quests, Company B, National Guard of
California, and now, in the name of the
Board of Trade and the citizens of Los
Gatos, I extend to you a most cordial wel
come, officers and members of Company
B. I trust that during your brief sojourn
in our midst you will enjoy to the fullest
extent aii the pleasures and attractions our
city affords. Gentlemen, I congratulate
you on the very favorable impression you
have made in our people. Your gentle
manly deportment, your parades, drills,
reviews and other interesting military ex
ercises have elicited from them the very
highest commendation.
"A few days ago while you were drilling
on the plaza, I stood within hearing of
several old soldiers, and gathered from
their remarks and the expression on their
faces that they considered you efficient in
your chosen calling, and possessed in a
marked degree of all the requisites of a
soldier. No doubt the ladies will concede
that you are also all handsome. Your
services to your country and your fellow
man cannot be easily overestimated. You
surrender your own personal interests in
order that you may become duly qualified
for your calling, and a soldier, be he old or
young, I believe merits the honor and ad
miration of every good citizen. I notice
present with us this evening several mem
bers of Company B, Fifth lnfanty Regi
ment of San Jose, and I also accord to
them a cordial welcome."
Hearty applause followed President
Bell's address, the signal was given, the
grand march began and the dance was on.

SAN DIEGO IS CONFIDENT
Little Doubt About Securing the
Japanese Steamship
Terminus.
Manager Iwanaga Makes an Exten
sive Trip of Observation
Around the Bay.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 21.â News has
been received here that S. Tomioka, who
was here a few weeks ago as private secre
tary to President Asano of the Toyo Kisen
Steamship Company, has been in the City
of Mexico for a week getting information
as to the running of steamers along the
Mexican coast as far south as San Benito.
Tomioka was supposed to have gone to
Chicago with Asano, but went directly to
Mexico. He was empowered by Asano to
enter into negotiations with the Govern
ment for the estabiisnment of a steamship
line to touch at all the principal ports, in
cluding Mazatlan, San Bias, Manzanillo,
Acapulco, Salina Cruz and San Benito.
While in Mexico Mr. Tomioka inter
viewed Sir Whetman Pearson, lessee of
the Tehuantepec Railway, and is believed
to have reached some agreement with that
road for handling through freight.
The Japanese Minister of Commerce,
the Viscount Enomoto, has signified a
; desire to establish connection with the
I Tehuantepec road| and a suggestion from
him is equivalent to an order, as he con
trols the Government subsidy to steam
ship companies. When Shonemoto, Com
missioner of Commerce and Industry, was
in San Diego he stated positively that the
Toyo Kisen Kaisha would make traffic ar
rangements with the Tehuantepec Rail
way if possible. He was in Mexico some
weeks before Toraioka arrived, and also
interviewed Sir Wnetman Pearson.
The significance of this move on the
part of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha is impor
tant to San Diego, and tends to confirm
the assurance that the steamers will make
San Diego their California port. If the
Toyo Kisen Kaisha enters into a compact
with ttie Tehauntepec Railway, its nearest
and most direct American connection will
be San Diego.
Sei i Ich Iwanaga, manaeer of the Nip
pon Yusen Kaisha Steamship Company,
made an extensive trip on the bay to-day
d c-^ oualness m en of the city and W.
B. Liddle, freight traffic manager of the
faanta Fe system, besides Pilot Dill. He
expressed the belief that the Tpyo Kisen
Kaisha has selected this port for a termi
nus, but at the same time sought all the
information possible concerning the har
bor and us terminal facilities. Mr.
Iwanaga s private secretary, who is jot
ting down all information obtained was
reticent as to the intention of his company
i^arding San Diego, but said the direc
tors in Japan uesired a full knowledge of
this port. The Japanese were taken to
various points on the bay tins afternoon
and leave in the morning for San Fran-
CISCO.

DR. SHORB'S CASE
AT LOS ANGELES,
Senator Stephen M. White
Is Attorney for the
Defense.
SEQUEL TO A TRAGEDY
The Physician Is Charged With
Causing the Death of -
Mrs. Snyder.
EVIDENCE OF MEDICAL MEN.
Case Continued Until To-Day, When
a Motion to Dismiss Will
Be Argued.
LOS ANGELEB OFFICE OF THE CAXL,)
328 South Broadway, >â¢ v
Los Asgeles, (Jal.. Auz. 2L )
Senator Stephen M. White appeared in
Police Judge Owens' court to-day as attor
ney for Dr. A. S. Shorb, charged with be
ing the cause of Mrs. Jennie Snyder's
death, on August 5, in this city. The par
ticulars of Mrs. Snyder's death and the
suicide of her lover are still fresh in the'
minds of the readers of The Call. Dr.
Sborb, the defendant, is an old man and
has been a resident of Los Angeles for
many,years. He is fortunate in securing
the services of Senator White, but, judg
ing from the expert testimony introduced
tbis morning, will undoubtedly be heid to
answer.
The prosecution will introduce nothing
but expert testimony. The testimony
taken at the Coroner's inquest was ruled
out and the morning session was taken up
in the examination of Drs. Salisbury and
Carson and Health Officer Steddom. The
evidence wÂ«nt to show that instruments
had been used in a careless manner.
Dr. Carson was free to admit that after
his examination of the deceased at the
autopsy he had remarked that the wound
as it appeared could have been inflicted
with a butcher-knife, but that he did not
wish the impression to prevail that such
an instrument was used upon the dead
woman.
District Attorney James, who is prose
cuting the case, says that after hearing
some expert testimony the people will
rest- He is confident that Shorb will be
held to answer to the Superior Court.
The case was finally continued to 11 A. M.
to-morrow, when Senator White will argue '
a motion to dismiss.
YACANCIEN AT UHITTIER.
The Recent Investigation JKnulted in
Several Resignations.
LOS ANGLES, Cal., Aug. 21.â The State
School at Whittier, according to current
rumor here to-day, has been left in the
lurch and indignantly deserted by three
very important officials, viz.: the matron
of the institution, a lady relief officer and
Miss Vesta Omstead, the lately deposed
principal who on sundry occasions in
months agone made vigorous use of a
leather "'cat" on the bare backs of refrac
torry girls.
Miss Omstead "resigned." the other two ]
have been deposed, but were to remain in
the institution until Trustee Keyes had,
with the consent of his associates on the
board, selected three competent successors.
Miss Omstead, it seems, organized a re
volt and leading the way made her dress
skirts fairly crack in her haste to quit the
institution. The other two, equally deter
mined to create a vacuum, followed Miss j
Omstead. The resolution abolishing cor
paral punishment was passed at a late |
meetinsr. Just what wiii be dons next j
Professor Keyes has not indicated, but it
is fair to presume that the places will be
easy enough to fill. Mrs. Mary R. Threl
keld, a philanthropist, builder of the
Newsboys' Home here and a splendidly
equipped lady for Miss Omstead 'a place,
was rejected by a majority of the board,
although championed by Trustee Adina
Mitchell and indorsed by Governor Budd.
NEGRO LABORER SUFFOCATED.
While Excavating for a Sewer a Cave of
Earth Occurs.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Aug. 21.â While
excavating at Fourteenth and Piru streets
this afternoon a cave-in occurred in the
sandy soil, burying one of the workmen,
a colored man named Albert Williams,
under five feet of earth. Tne excavation
was nearly fifteen feet deep, and before
the dirt could be removed, an operation
which took three-quarters of an hour, the
negro had died from suffocation. The
permit to connect at the sewer was ap
plied for by Roeder Brothers. No attempt
bad been made to plank the sides of the
hole to keep it from caving.
EQUALIZERS AT SACRAMENTO.
Sclano Officials Appear Before the Board
and Recite a Number of
Grievances.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 21. âSuper
visors Clark and Buckingham and Assessor
Charles Schirmer, of Solano County, ap
JOE PATCHEN LOWERS THE PACING RECORD.
PORTLAND, Me., Aug. 21.â The stallion Joe Patchen lowered the world's stal
lion pacing record, held by John R. Gentry, at Rigby by a quarter of a second in a
fresh wind, making the mile in 2:03. His quarters were: :30^â :29}Â£â :30Â»4-:325Â£.
peared before the Board of Equalization
during the afternoon session and related
their grievances. They told how the rate
on improvements alone in Valleio had in
creased $86,287, and stated that there had
been a slight increase in valuation both in
Vaca ville and Suisun. There had formerly
been a drydocfc in Vallejo which had
helped to swell the roll |37,500, but that
had ceased to exist.
Then Equalizer Beamer quietly called
the Assessor's attention to the fact that
there existed a decrease of $1,500,000 in
outside property values, and he began ex
plaining matters. He told how orchards
were assessed at $150 an acre, trees being
considered to be worth |50 per acre.
President Morehouse thought that the
assessment on trees should be raised, as, In
his opinion, they doubled the value of the
land, but Schi.-mer retorted by saying that
many of the property-owners would prefer
the land without the trees.
Schirmer also stated that he assessed all
marsh lands, worthless for any purpose
save hunting-grounds, for from $4 to $5
per acre, and presented numerous in
stances in which land had been sold for
less than its assessed value.
Tnen Arnold took a bowl at the As
sessor by inquiring into the system of as
sessing banks, and Schirmer Baia he had
taken the statement of the banks as a
basis upon which to assess them, and de
clared that he did not know what else
to do.
The statements to the Bank Commis
sioners were then compared with the as
sessment of banks, and the comparison
showed that the banks had escaped assess
ment on an immense amount of property.
IOLO'S BAD SHOWING.
The Assessment- H..V Falls Off >early
9500,000.
SACRAMENTO, C/I-, Aug. 21.â Mark
Chamberlain and se^aral of the Super
visors of Yolo County made their excuses
for the small assessment-roll before the
Board of Equalization this morning. The
assessment-roll shows a falling off of nearly
half a million dollars, the greater part be
ing personal property and solvent credits.
In explanation of the falling off in per
sonal property Assessor Chamberlain
stated that there were $52,000 worth of
wheat. $17,000 Â«f meichandise, 7000 sheep
and 2000 horses less returned this year
than last. There were formerly a great
many sheep raised in Yolo for wool, but
not a pound of wool was produced last
year.
The farmers are in such a financial con
dition that they cannot even repair build
ings, make improvements or purchase
farming utensils. Several buildings have
been destroyed by fire, and have not been
replaced, levees have not been repaired
and hundreds of acres of laud overflowed
made worthless.
GOVERNOR BUDD AT TAHOE
Arrives on Horseback After In
specting the Old Placer
ville Road.
Delighted With His Trip and Is
Making Good Catches at
the Lake.
TALLAC, Lake Tahoe, Cal., Aug. 21.â
Governor Budd arrived this morning. HÂ«
came on horseback, accompanied by a
valet and C. E. Hobridge, Road Commis
sioner of Sacramento. Immediately upon
their arrival the Governor lunched with
Joseph Austin, appraiser of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, and John Mc-
Laren, superintendent of Golden Gate
Park, together with tneir wives, and spent
the afternoon resting. His route was
taken from Sacramento over the old Placer
ville road, recently purchased by the State,
which he personally inspected, and it is
ibe first occurrence in a long while that a
Governor ever came on horseback in per
son to oversee work on State property.
With regard to the road'he said:
"I have never seen a better road in my
life. It must have been of wonderful con
struction when new. Every three miles
are ruins of old watering-places where the
road was kept wetted down and in good
condition. At present, however, and be
fore the State purchased the road, these
I places have been aoolished and placed
over ten miles apart. Even then some are
not u?ed. The culverts are in bad condi
tion and in many places dangerous to
public safety. 1 came over the road and
personally supervised its reconstruction,
stopping here and there as the work pro
gressed, and when finished I think we
shall restore it to its original condition."
Mr. Hobridge was also interviewed and
expressed the same opinion. The Placer
ville road was the old pioneer road from
Sacramento to Nevada over which all the
business was done in the early days of
silver-mining In Nevada. It was built
substantially in 1862 and to serve its pur
pose, which it has done until within the
last lew years, when the toll was discon
tinued. The Governor arrived at Straw
berry, on the road twenty miles from Tal
lac, August 9, where he has remained
since, visiting the mountains and taking
trips to the little lakes in the vicinity,
among them Echo Lake, twelve miles
southwest of Tallac, on the summit to
Placerville, which was restocfced with
15,000 sal mo-my kiss nnder his supervision
by E. W. Hunt, superintendent of the
Tahoe hsh station. Among the places vis
ited were the American River and Silver
Lake, situated near here, and where the
fishing is excellent.
The Governor reported fine luck, and is
weil satisfied with his catches. Of Lake
Tahoe the Governor said: "It is a grand
place, and should be the resort of the
coast. Tallac is the prettiest resort 1 have
seen."
How long he will be at the lake is not
known, but be expects to remain at least a
couple of days. To-morrow a special
steamer will be chartered, and In company
with Mr. Lawrence, Dr. Hall and Karl
Hermann of San Francisco, the party will
have a fishing trip around the lake.
CHILD MURDER
AT OROVILLE.
A Halfbreed Indian Mother
Strangles Her Newly-
Born Babe.
SHE FEARED DISGRACE.
Vainly Implored the Physician
to Kill the Baby at Its
Birth.
A CORONER'S INQUEST IS HELD.
The Woman Will Be Arraigned for the
Crime as Soon as Her Condition
Will Permit.
OROVILLE, Cal., Aug. 21.â The rumor
on the street this morning that a mother
had strangled her new-born baby on in
vestigation proved true. Miss Mary Ab
bott, a half-breed Indian seamstress, who
occupies two rooms of a house owned by
B. Russell on Montgomery street, called
a physician on Wednesday evening and
informed him she would soon give birth to
a child and desired his services. She
stated that no nurse would be needed, as
she did not wish the public to know her
condition. The doctor refused to have
anything to do with her unless a nurse
was secured. She refused, and he left.
Thursday evening Dr. Wilson was sent
for. To him the woman made the same
statement, adding that her sister was
coming from the mountains and would
arrive that evening. The doctor called
twice during the night. Early this morn
ing a heavy ten-pound boy wa3 delivered
all right.
While the doctor was removing the
mucus membrane from the baby's mouth
and nostrils the mother said: "Do not do
that, but let the child die." He refused
to be connected with any such crime, and
carefully wrapped the baby in a sheet and
placed it at the foot of the bed. A few
minutes later the baby cried, when the
mother t ried to kill it witn her foot. The
doctor interfered, when she raised up in
bed, caught the child by the head and
shoulders, and tried to wring its necK-
The doctor seized her by the throat, com
pelling her to release her hold of the baby,
threatening her with arrest if any harm
happened to the child.
After completing his work and having
her assurance that no further attempt
would be made to take the child's life he
left, thinking that she would keep her
promise. Later he called and found the
mother doing well. On inquiry for the
child she replied: "The baby went to
sleep and I placed it under the bed." .
Her appearance indicated that all was
not right, aud the doctor hurriedly pushed
the bed aside, finding the baby wrapped
in a sheet and lying on a quilt. On closer
examination he found the mother had tied
a towel around the child's neck and stran
gled him to death.
The doctor asked if she had murdered
the child and she replied: "Yes and it is
none of your business. You had no right
to remove the membrane from the nostrils
so the child could breathe; you ought to
have let it die."
Dr. Wilson informed the Coroner, Sher
iff and District Attorney. They visited
the sicE woman and found the child as
above stated. The Coroner's jury brought
in a verdict charging Miss Mary Abbott
with having murdered her infant. A war
rant was sworn to before Judge Leonard
charging her with murder. A watch will
be kept on her until her condition is such
as to permit a trial.
LOS ANGELES BALLY.
Interesting Republican Addreaaes to a
I.ttrar Guthering.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 21. â A
great Republican gathering took place
under the auspices of the Young Men's
Republican League in the Stowell block
here tnis evening, which was addressed
by Hon. James McLachlan, Republican
candidate for Congress, and E. Li. McKin
ley of Santa Rosa. Mr. McKinley made
the principal speech of the evening. He
reviewed silver legislation in Europe and
America, showing conclusively that at
tempts to raise tho bullion price of silver
by legislation in this country had utterly
failed, as in the case of the Bland-Allison
act and the Sherman purchasing law.
The conclusion waa that the Republican
party, according to its platform, is the
only true bimetallic political organization
in the country, as bimetallism by treaty
stipulation among the great powers of the
earth alone can raise the intrinsic value of
silver and thus add its volume to the
money of the country and put it on a
parity with gold.
The speaker paid a high tribute lo the
National standard-bearer of the party
and his illustrious and splendid record
both in war and peace.
Quoting the words of Congressman Bar
ham of the First District, the speaker
said: "Our Congressman, who knows
your representative in tne lower house far
better than I do, says that the people of
the Los Angeles district should re-elect
McLachlan almost unanimously, owing to
his sterling qualities of nead and heart,
his ability, and. above all, his untiring in
dustry in behalf of nis constituents."
DEMOCRATS A ND POPULISTS.
The Ticket Xamed, by the Two Idaho
Conrentions.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 21.â A special
to the Herald from Boise, Idaho, says:
Frank Steunenberg was nominated for
Governor by the Democrats to-day, ft. E.
McFarland for Attorney-General, George
8. Stoner for Treasurer and B. F. Hastings
for Mine Inspector. It is not believed the
Populists will make any nominations to

LOS ANGELES CAMPAIGN
Tet Another Congressional Candidate to
Be dominated.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 21.â Another
candidate, it seems, is to be injected into
the political fight in the Sixth Congres
sional District. The outcome of the Dem
ocratic convention ot yesterday did not
please the Silverites a little bit and in
consequence, a conference has been under
way here to-day with a view of arranging
for a mass-convention of free-silver men
to nominate one of their number for Con
gress.
Several notable silver leaders, including
Alva Udell, secretary of the Bimetallic
League for California, Enoch Pepper, H.
H. Savage, Colonel I. E. Messmore, J. C.
Conners, John R. Berry and others at
tended the caucus to-day. The talk is
now, that Colonel Messmore, who came
within two votes of defeating George S.
Patton for the nomination two years ago,
will be the latest candidate. Charles Bar
low's nomination at San Luis Obispo, it
has been asserted, has satisfied the silver
men of the district, but the gentlemen
named say they want no Barlow in theirs.

favorable to George W. Monteith, but they
take this step to get out of a bad predica
ment.

Citizens Call a Meeting to Rid the
Town of Questionable Char*
acters. I
SANTA MONICA, Cax., Aug. 21.â W.
R. H. Sulliger, a prominent merchant of
Santa Monica, was held up last night by
two thugs on Ocean avenue, within a
stone's throw of Senator Jones' residence,
and received two pistol shot wounds. Mr.
Sulliger, who has been in the drug busi
ness here for four year?, has been in the
habit of taking a walk every evening
after closing his place of business. Last
night, shortly after 9 o'clock, he closed
his store, and when on his walk he reached
a point on Ocean avenue opposite the resi
dence of Mr. Abbott Kinney he was ac
costed by two men who tcld him to hold
up his hands.
Thinking it was a couple of friends in
tending to play a practical joke he poked
nis cane at them, when one of the thugs
nit him on the head with a club which,
felled him to the ground. Sulliger then
reached for nis gun, when the highway
men fired al him twice. The first ball
entered the left shoulder and lodged in
the neck, the other ball entering the left
leg.
He immediately cried for help, when a
number of ladies and gentlemen came out
and a search was at once instituted for the
murderers. They were both men of me
dium height, one wearing dark clothes
and the other light. The hat of the darkly
clothed one having fallen from his head,
is in the possession of the police. The
doctor who is attending Mr. Sulliger does
not consider the wounds dangerous, and
he is doing as nicely as could be ex
pected.
Word reached town this evening that â¢
man answering the description of one of
the men, without a hat, had been arrested
in Los Angeles. The Board of Trustees
met this afternoon and offered a reward of
$300 for the capture of the fugitives. A
citizens' meeting bas been called to rid the
town of a lot of tinhorn gamblers who re
cently have put in an appearance.
Two veterans, members of the Soldiers'
Home here, were held up late last night
by a gang of highway men on the Southern
Pacific Railroad track, between the home
and the crossing of the Pasadena and
Pacific Electric track. From one they se
cured $1 60 and $30 from the other.

More Students Than the
University Can Care
For.
MANY IROM TEE EAST.
Standard of Preparation Among
Applicants Raised by the
Rush.
POLITICS AT THE COLLEGE.
Arrangements Being Made for a Re
publican Celebration in the
Quadrangle.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Aug.
21. â Present indications go to show that
the incoming freshman class will be the
largest ever received at Stanford. Appli
cations for attendance have been pouring
in from all sections of the country, from
the East especially, and it is liK.ely that
the whole number of applicants will reach
1500. It is certain that the present re
sources of the university cannot be
stretched to accommodate so large a num
ber, and it is practically certain that almost
half the new students will be refused ad
mission. In all cases persons coming with
full standing will be preferred to specials,
so the outlook for prospective specials is
not encouraging. This choosing among
applicants will undoubtedly benefit the
university, as it will greatly raise the
standard of preparation among the mem
bers of the freshman class. President Jor
dan is now in Alaska, and the exact limit
of attendance will not be set until hi 3 re
turn.
Encina and Roble halls will this year
be under the charge of two graduate
students, O. N. Eaton, '95, and G. B. Wil
son, '96. Formerly the halis were managed
on the co-operative plan by a committee
chosen by the occupants and by a steward
acting under them, This year the univer
sity will have entire charge of the affairs,
with Eaton and Wilsoo as their agents.
Roble Hall will be lull, with a number of
applications left over, and Encina, for the
lirst time in' its history, will be nearly if
not Quite full.
If indications count for anything, there
is going to be a great deal of political ex
citement at Stanford this year. The uni
versity is largely Republican. The Re
publican club organized last spring began
its career with a membership of 250.
John M. Switzer and W. H. Irwin, re
spectively president and vice-president,
are arranging for a mammoth Republican
rally to be held in the quadrangle shortly
after the opening of the university, when
Senator Perkins, Irving M. Scott and other
prominent sound- money advocates will
address the students on the issue? of the
campaign. The Republican clubs of May
field and of Palo Alto are expected to par
ticipate. Almost all the students will this
fall be ranged actively with one party or
the other, but the Republicans outnumber
the Democrats at least three to one.
Registration commences August 31, and
active business will begin with the open
ing of instruction on September 4.

in the County-
Hospital.
ONE DEAD, ONE DYING,
Instead of a Black Draught He
Administers a Deadly
Poison.
THE NURSE WAS ABSENT
Important Duties Left to Ignorant
Hands â A Horrible
Result.
Richard Sherlock, nurse in charge of
ward B in the City and County Hospital,
caused a fatal accident by his trip down
town yesterday afternoon. He left his
duties in the hands of a willing but igno
rant patient, and as a result one man lies
dead in his hospital cot and another
writhes in all the agonies caused by acute
poisoning.
The two patients, David Netcher and
Thomas Murphy, were to have undergone
a delicate operation to-day, and to prepare
them for the ordeal Dr. Waller, physician
in charge of the ward, ordered that at
frequent intervals physic be given to
them. His orders were delivered to Sher
lock, the ward nurse.
About half-past 1 o'clock yesterday after
noon Sherlock went to Dr. Dudley, then
in charge, and stated that every
thing was all right in his ward and that
he bad left another nurse in charge.
Instead of doing this he had giv
en his medciine closet keys to George
Mallaber, a half-blind patient, with
instructions to give certain doses to
several of the inmates of the ward.
Among these were Murphy and Netcher,
who were to be given a black draught.
When the time came to administer the
medicine to Mallaber the two men went
to the drug closet and blunderingly
picked up a bottle containing the tincture
of cocculus indicus, a pbison externally
used as a linament upon some other pa
tient.
In a few minutes Netcher and Murphy
were taken directly ill and were soon in
convulsions. The physicians were called
and every effort put forth to repair the
fatal mistake. Netcher died about 5
o'clock, but Murphy revived under the
treatment and has a fighting chance for
life.
Shirlock returned about 6 o'clock to the
hospital and was confronted with the re
sult of his negligence. He had no excuse
to make, and seemed to be stupefied by
the occurrence.
Superintendent Stable notified the Sev
enteenth-street police station shortly after
midnight and Sherlock was placed under
arrest.
Sherlock's statement of the sad affair
was thr.t the two patients, Daniel Netcher,
who is dead, and Thomas Murpby, who i&
dying, were to undergo a delicate opera
tion this jnorning. He was instructed by
the doctor to give them each a black
draught during the afternoon.
He had occasion to go downtown, and
he instructed George Mallabar, another
patient in the ward, to give them the
black draught, which was in a bottle in
his locker. He gave Mallabar the keys of
his locfcer when he left to go downtown,
and that was all be knew about it.
Netcher was a native of Massachusetts,
aged 60 years, single and admitted to the
hospital August 15 suffering from cataract.
He formerly resided at 5 Enterprise alley.
"I consider it in the highest degree re
maikable." said Dr. Stable, "that after
eight years of faithful and efficient service
Sherlock should have been so neglectful
of his duty.
"I have always found him diligent and
prudent. How he could bring himself to
turn over the keys of his medicine chest
to the half-blind patient, Malabar, is
more than I can conceive.
N "His negligence, to my mind, is plainly
criminal, though I am most surprised at
it. It looks as though no one could be
trusted when a man considered so reliable
as was Sherlock, allows himself to commit
so grave an imprudence."
Richard Shirlock has been a nurse at
the institution for the past eight years and
is a sober and experienced man.
Thomas Murphy, the man for whose life
the doctors are battling, is a native of
Ireland, aged about 76 years. He lived at
114 Twelfth street.
SUICIDE AT NAPA.
F. Â£. Mielinz, Distracted Over Financial
Losses, Sends a Bullet Through
His Brain.
NAPA, Cal., Aug. 21. â Another case has
been added to the Iocs; list of suicides
committed in Napa during the past two
â¢ months. This morning at 5:30 o'clock, F. E.
Mielinz committed suicide by firing a bul
let through his brain, the ball entering the
right side of his head.
The son, William Mielinz, was awakened
by the report, and sprang out of bed. â¢ He
hastened from his room, and entering the
sitting-room found his father lying on the
couch, blood oozing from a wound on the
right side of the head, and a 38-caiiber
pistol lying on the floor near the couch.
They young man hastily summoned a
physician, but before he could arrive his
father had breathed his last.
Coroner R. M. Kyser summoned a jury
composed of the following-named persons:
Thomas Cuff, A. H. Conkling, Peter Han
sen, Charles Howe, Harry Brown and G.
M. Francis, who rendered a verdict in ac
cordance with the nbove facts.
Mr. Mielinz was well acquainted through
out Napa Valley, having been employed
here for many year*. A few years ago he
was a large owner of real estate in Napa,
but suffered many financial losses. He
worried over his troubles and became de
spondent. While in such a frame of mind
be took his own life. A few days ago he
said to his son, Will: "This worry about
financial matters is enough to make any
man blow his brains out. 1 '
He leaves a wife and four children;
three sons, William, Edward and Stanley,
and one daughter, Constance.
The funeral will be held to-morrow after
noon at 2 o'clock from the family resi
dence on Fourth street.

IMPORTANT MEETING AT FRESNO.
Valley Road Officers Have a Highly Satis-
factory Conference With Many
Property-Owners.
FRESNO, Ual. Aug. 21.â Several officials
of the Valley Road, accompanied by mem
bers of engineering corps, arrived in
Fresno to-day and to-night held a meet
ing with between forty and fifty owners of
property on Q and Diana streets who are
objecting to the entry of the road into the
city until they are paid damages to their
property. Vice-President Watt on behalf
of the Valley Road assured them that tne
road would not run over or injure their
property without just compensation.
He said the road wanted to come in
without making a single enemy and had
no purpose of going to law wit anybody.
He stated further that the Valley road* is
willing to leave the question of damages to
any local committee that is satisfactory to
the people of Fresno, this committee to
agree with the property-owners, and such
agreement, if at all reasonable, will be ac
cepted by the Valley road. Mr. Watt's
freindly speech had a decidedly good effect
and the prospect now is that a speedy settle
ment will be reached. The owners oi about
forty lots have already signed an agree
ment waiving all claims to damages.

TRAGEDY IN A MADHOUSE
Owen Clements Gets His Death
Blow at the Hands of
Carl Gustafsen.
His Skull Fractured With a Mop Be
cause He Didn't Get Out of
the Way.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 21.â 1n the
morgue at the State Asylum awaiting in
terment this evening lies the body of a
patient who was dealt his death blow day
before yesterday by another patient while
the two were in one of the wards of tbe
big building in which male lunatics are
confined. Tne particulars of tbe affair are
meager because the attendant of tbe ward
was at the further end of tbe long hallway
between the two rows of cells when the
blow was struck which sent the victim to
his death.
Tbe name of the dead man is Owen
Clements, and he was committed from
San Francisco six or eight months ago.
His slayer is Carl Gustafsen, a strapping
big fellow, who had been an inmate of the
madhouse for a year and a half.
Gustafsen was rubbing down the floor
with an implement made of a piece of a
board on a long handle, the crosspiece
beins covered with carpeting and having
on its under aide a section of rubber.
C-lements was in the habit of approaching
persons and kicking them on the shins,
and it is supposed that he did this to
Gustafsen. The latter raised the imple
ment and dealt Clements a blow on the
head which felled him unconscious to the
floor. The attendant, hearing him fall,
ran up and Gustafsen was taken into cus
tody.
An examination of the injoied man
failed to discloae the severity of the
wound, because no indentation could be
detected in the skull. Yesterday fore
noon, however, he died, and an autopsy
was held. It snowed that the skull bad
been fractured. Coroner Clark was in
formed immediately after the man's
death.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon an inquest
was held at tbe asylum in the board of
directors' room. The testimony showed
that the deceased was 43 years old and
was a native of Ireland. Both he and his
slayer were quite crazy.
E. L. Ballou, the attendant who first
discovered what had happened, testified
that he asked Gustafsen why he struck
Clements, and tbe reply was,""rie ought
to have got out of my way."
DEATH BEFORE DISGRACE
Stanley Williams Took His Em
ployer's Money and Ended
His Own Life.
Sickness and Expenses Caused Him to
Do That Which Made Him
Anxious to Die.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway, Aug. 21. )
Despondent from financial reverses and
ill health Stanley Williams took his life
early this morning.
He had suffered from Bright's disease
for five years, and with the illness of his
wife, the expense was more than he could
stand, and in a moment of weakness he
used the money that belonged to his em
ployers, and seeing that the fact must be
discovered and knowing it was impossible
40 repay the amount, he placed a revolver
to his right temple and ended his life.
Williams was a solicitor for Mau, Sadler
& Co. of San Fraucisco, having been with
them for seven years, but he had never
mentioned his troubles to any one there,
fie was an Englishman, 46 years of age,
and came to this country about ten years
ago with his wife and three children. He
was formerly in business, but reverses
came and hewent to work on commission.
The deed was committed after the fam
ily had retired for the night in the newly
built home on Leise avenue, near Hi h
street, in Fruitvale. He went to his room
and fired the fatal shot. The report and
the sound of the body falling on the floor
awakened the boys and their mother. An
investigation showed that the shot had
caused almost instant death.
F. W. Spiars of this city says Williams
came to him yesterday to get $450 to
square his accounts with the firm, and on
being told that he did not have it at hand
Williams threatened to take his life. Mr.
Spiars advised him lo go to the tirm and
explain matters, and he felt that they
would give him time to square himself.
When told that the man haa killed him
self Mr. Bpiars was greatly shocked.
Deceased carried life insurance to the
extent of ?8000, so that tne family will be
I well provided for.
WATSON'S FREEZE
DOES NOT THAW,
Democrats Masticating the
Remains of the People's
Party.
AN UNPOPULAR FUSION.
The Populist Vice-Presidential
Candidate Sacrificed to
Sewall.
VOICE OF THE PARTY PRESS.
Democracy Now Proceeding to Euchre
Its Ally on Congressmen Helped
by the S P. Co.
The sub-committee appointed by the
conference committee of the Democratic,
People's and Silver parties resumed their
session at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon in
the California Hotel. E. M. Wardall,
chairman of the People's party State Com
mittee, and John S. Dore, National Com
mitteeman, represented the Populists, M.
C. Hassett and A. Caminetti the Demo
crats and G. Cohn and W. P. Lawlor the
Silver men.
The chairman stated that the object of
the joint meeting of the above sub
committee was to make such recommenda
tions concerning the First and Third Con
gressional districts as would produce a
union of the People's and Democratic
parties in presenting a candidate for Con
gress in each of the said districts.
Mr. Wardall moved as to the Third Con
gressional District that the iollowing reso
lution be adopted:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this commit
tee that the meeting of the People's party
convention of the Third Congressional District
ought to be postponed from the 25th of August
to the 4th of September, 1896, and tbat said
convention be held that day in the city of
Vallejo; also, that the Democratic Congres
sional cons-ention of the Third District should
be held at the same time and place, in order, if
possible, that a union be effected between said
conventions in the selection of a candidate for
Congress mutually agreeable to both the
People's party and the Democratic party con
ventions. And be it further
Resolved, That a copy oi this resolution be
forwarded immediately to E. M. Wardall and
William H. Alford, chairmen respectively of
the People's party and Democratic party Sfate
Central committees, with the request that they
immediately institute such proceedings as
they may deem necessary to effect the objects
herein set iorth.
The resolutions were carried.
Mr. Dore rnoyed as to the First Con
gressional District that no action be taken
until a general plan of union on Congres
sional candidates applicable to all dis
tricts is adopted by a conference commit
tee of the Democratic, People's and Silver
parties. Carried.
Mr. Dore moved that this sub-committee
recommend to the conference committee
that provision be made for the appoint
ment of a joint committee to formulate a
plan of action providing for a union on
candidates for Congress in all the districts
of the State. Carried.
John S. Dore, A. Caminetti and W. P.
Lawlor were appointed the joint commit
tee and will meet at 10 o'clock Tuesday
morning.
The State executive committee of the
People's party will meet on Monday at
2 f. m. to consider the proposal to fuse on
electors.
John S. Dore, the People's party Na
tional committeeman who refused to ac
quiesce in the Demo-Populist fusion,
received several dispatches yesterday
from influential Populists in the San Joa
quin Valley commending him for the
stand he has taken, namely, that Bryan
and Watson are the nominees of the Peo
ple's party National Convention at St.
Louis, and that any combination with
Democrats or others that will cast the
majority of the Populist vote in any State
for gewall for Vice-President is treason to
the party.
The terms of the fusion proposed by the
Democrats last Thursday provides that
when a Populist casts bis ballot at the
polls he will give Sewall five votes and
Watson only four votes. Fortunately for
the integrity of the People's party the
fusion has not been accepted by the State
Central Committee of that organization.
It will be considered at a meeting to be
held next Monday morning, on which oc
casion Mr. Dore will file his minority re
port, which will fully set forth the reasons
which have actuated him in votins: against
a fusion which would have the effect of
depriving Thomas Watson of five out of
every nine votes.
The State Committee will hays plenty
of light on the subject before they meet,
and if they ratify the unholy marriage
they will do so with open eyes and with
full knowledge of the sentiment of the
masses of the People's party, not only in
California, but all over the rest of the
United States.
Three-fourths of the Populist organs
published in this State have protested
against the sacrifice of Thomas Watson
UDon the aitar of the ambition of National
Banker Sewall, and those newspapers are
the most influential of their class, as a
glance at the list will show :
The New Charter, San Jose, M. W. Wilkins.
Merced Daily Sun, J. Radcliffe.
Visalia News and Tulare Citizen, W. H. Gil
strop and G. P. Manchester.
Equity, Santa Barbara, Melvin Snow.
Industry, Oakland, J. C. Buttner.
Civic Review, Los Angeles, Pv. E. Curran.
Redding Searchlight, M. E. Dittmar.
The Keystoue, Fresno, George H. Malter.
Mr. Malter has left the name of the can
didate for President blank, with an inter
rogation mark at the end, and prints the
name "Thomas Watson" in big letters.
Ex-Congressman Caminetti is fearful
lest some reader of The Call might sus
pect that he said he was in favor of kicking
out Grover Cleveland and the rest of the
Democratic gang and kicking in W. J.
Bryan and the rest of the Democratic
gang. Nobody has accused Mr. Caminetti
of saying so, but he is assisting in the
work just as hard.
Advices are pouring in from all parts of
the State to the effect that Popolists and
many Democrats are declaring that they
will vote only for the four Bryan and
Watson electors, and that they will not
crucify Bryan and Sewali on their Austra
lian ballots with the red rubber stamp.
The County executive committee of the
People's party held a meeting last night
in Dr. G. W. Daywalt's office in the
Murphy building, eleven of the fifteen
memoers being present T. V. Cator,
Joseph Asbury Johnson and Dr. Day waldt
were appointed a committee on ways and
means for the campaign.
The next meeting will be held next
Monday evening.
The County Committee will meet this
evening in Mozart Hall.
It will be remembered that shortly after
the return of the Californian delegation
from St. Louis the executive committee
of the State Central Committee issued an
address to the People's party of California
in which the following occur:
It is beyond question that our convention
was almost a unit in its determination not 10
accept the Democratic Candida c for Vice-
President as our nominee. Mr. Sewall, in our
judgment, was a misfit as a candidate upon
the Chicago platform. The Chicago conven
tion undertook, by its expulsion of tne gold
ring and its nomination of Mr. Bryan, whose
sincenty seems to be estaDlished, to satisfy the
country that the record of the Democratic
party for breaking platform pledges was
ended and that hereafter it meant what it
said. The selection of Mr. Sewall does not aid
this purpose. He is president of a National
bank and has been largely connected with
corporations. Is a National banker a con
sistent candidate upon the Chicago platform,
which declares for abolishing the issue of Na
tional Dank notes?
It is said by some that Mr. Sewall may be as
thoroughly in favnr of this policy as anyone.
If this maybe so, the masses, so otten deceived
by political professions, cannot be expected to
believe it. Men are not usually opposed to
their own business, or their own interests; the
public cannot be expected to believe that they
are. If Mr. Bryan were a National banker, no
one can doubt "that he would be unable to con
vince the public that he was the man for this
time and for this platform; ought not Mr.
Sewall to come up to the same standard as Mr.
Bryan? Our convention thought so, and we
believe that the great mass of voters who are
aÃked to etect the Chicago ticket think so. Our
convention wisely declined to accept Mr.
Sewall and selected a man who is a consistent
mate for Mr. Bryan and also chose as a Na
tional committee a body which is absolutely
loyal to Mr Watson and in which every .popu
list may repose full centideuce in the great
contest to be waged in this campaign.
This address was signed by the follow

Every seat in the church was filled and
much interest was manifested in the ex
ercise* and the excellent addresses made.
The interior was handsomely decorated
wiih ferns aud flowers. Directly above the
altar was suspended a banner of red velvet,
on which was inscribed in letters of
white, "For Christ and His Church." The
artistic poster for the convention of '97
held a conspicuous position near the pul
pit.
The meeting was opened by a praise
service, led by J. J. Morris. This was
followed by a Scripture reading and
prayer led by J. A. Wiles.

May the Master come into every meeting to
blebs' and help, and the Holy Spirit to give

San Jose, Aug. 20, 1896.
Lrster Ji. Smithâ Dear Brother: Permit me
to thank you for the kind invitation of Plym
outh Endeavorers.
I am receiving invitations to attend meet
ings and speak by almost every mail, and am
compelled to forego the pleasure in many in
stances. It was my great pleasure to speak to
the Golden Gate Union in Dr. Dille's church
but tjeo weeKs ago, and since the two meltings
will De compoÃed very largely ot the same
young people, and there will doubtless be a
great amount ot information to be imparted
by the members of your committee of '95,
and business to be transacted of local impor
tance. I will not impose upon the good nature
ot your people by accepting your invitation to
be present and speak.
I am sure that all who are acquainted with
your committee of '97 and with the earnest
ness and enthusiasm of the Endeavorers of
San Francisco have perfect faith in the out
come of your preparations for the interna
tional convention, and it will be the aim and
purpose of the State officers to contribute ail
in their power to the success of the conven
tion by awakening such an interest among the
Endeavorers of the State that will insure their
presence in San Francisco next July.
Read i'hilippians, first chapter, verses 3,4,
5 and 6. Faithfully yours,
Gut W. Campbell.

He described the wonderful progress
made by the Christian Endeavor move
ment and said: "We believe tue great in
fluence sent out to all classes will be of
nearly as much avail for good as the ef
fort* of the church itself.
"We hope that the benefits of this con
vention will be greater than the benefits
ever received by any city in the past."
Succeeding an anthem sung by the Ply
mouth choir. J. S. Webster spoke on
"San Francisco '97."
He spoke of the correspondence Deing
received on the approaching convention
and said that many States are already
making arrangements for this event.
He shadowed forth the great benefits
that would accrue from the convention,
not only to California in general, but more
especially to San Francisco and its vicinity.
"Here, though, lies the danger. The
elevating and stimulating influences of
this great gathering are the prizes to be
looked foi ward to, not merely the mate
rial. The former will be everlasting.
"An event of this kind comes only once
in a lifetime.
"This great army of young peocle in our
State should be sowers for this great har
vest that is in fact only a time of planting
send."
This was followed by a soprano solo,
"Hosanna," sung by Miss Millie Flynn,
with violin obligato by A. Harold Kayton.
The address on "Washington Sparks"
by Rev. William Rader was omitted, ow
ing to the fact of Mr. Rader's absence in
San Jose.

READY FOR THE RUSH,
Berkeley Juniors Give the "oo"
Men the Usual Amount of
Good Advice.
Bids on College Buildingsâ Libraria
Rowell's Annual Reportâ Protest
Against a School.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 21â The fresh
men at the university met this afternoon
for the first time since they matriculated,
effected a temporary organization and de
cided to "rash" the sop homores on next
Tuesday night. This first formal meeting
of the 00 men was full of excitement and
noteworthy incidents.
They were called together, 450 strong,
at Harmon Gymnasium by the juniors,
their traditional college friends in the
activity of college life, who gave them
sage advice as to the ways they should go,
aud what it would mean to them if they
should come out victors in the coming
rush.
P. N. Newhall, who served as chair man
of the junior ciass in the absence of Presi
dent Dorn, calleil the freshmen together.
After he had finished his introductory
speech James Oliver took the platform
and dealt out a good portion of wisdom,
such as freshmen need. He was fol
lowed by Track Captain Brown, who
talked for twenty minutes on athlet
ics and debating. Philip Thayor ad
vised the 00 men not to paint the
fences, and J, A. Young admonished them
to rusn hard wnen they ran against the
sophomores.
The election of temporary officers and
the fixing of a date for the interclass battle
followed.
W. Boutwell Dunlap of Sacramento, a
freshman of more than ordinary avoirdu-
I pois and with a stentorian voice, was
elected chairman. He walked on tsis
crutches to the platform and proceeded
to handle the audience, which by this
time had become much worked up, in
true California State Legislature style.
When the crowd became too noisy ho
rapped on the railing with his crutch or
pounded it on the floor.
W. M. Davis of Belmont was chosen
temporary secretary.
The class decided upon next Tuesday
evening, when the moon is full, as the
time for their big rush. Throughout the
meeting excitement was at a high pitch.
Cheers were frequent and prolonged,
j and when the meeting was over the largest
class that ever entered the State Uni
versity went out with full confidence of
beating the sophomores on Tuesday night
and thus emulate the glory of the class
of 98.
Affiliated Colleges.
Bids for work on the proposed new
Affiliated Colleges buildings were received
today at Berkeley by the committee on
buildings and grounds, consisting of Re
gents J. West Martin, John E. Budd and
J. B. Reinstein, in whose hands lies the
award of contracts lor labor. Seventy
seven bids were received for the seven
kinds of work indicated in the proposal
issued by the board.
Following are the kinds of work to be
done, for which sealed bids were called:
First â For the masonry work, including all
brick, stone, terra cotta and concrete work,
and all necessary excavations and fillings.
Secondâ For the iron work.
Thirdâ For the carpenter, plastering, elec
tric and glazing work. .
Fourthâ For the plumbing and gasfitting
work.
Fifthâ For the heating work.
Sixthâ For the tinning, galvanized iron and
slating work.
Seventhâ For the paint and graining work.
About fifty contractors representing the
different house-building trades from dif
ferent parts of the State were present at
the call ior estimates. The bids were so
numerous that it was quite impossible to
tell accurately whether the sum total of
the lowest ones came under the $250,000
appropriation, but it is believed that they
â¢will fall considerably under that mark.
The committee of the board will take
several days in which to decide upon the
awards.
â Librarian's Annual Report.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 21.â Librarian
Rowell of the State University completed
his annual report to-day, and sent it to
President Keilo.'g, who will pass upon it
prior to its publication in the annual re
port of Secretary Bonte. The report
shows that at the present time official rec
ord is made of 63,475 books, 3023 of which
have been received since June, 1895.
During the year of 1895-98 3629 visitors
were received in the Bacon Art Gallery,
and since its establishment in 1882 53,507
visitors have entered it.
The librarian makes a strong plea for
donations of books and tbe increasing of
the endowment, stating that the income
of the Reese fund is only large enough to
supply books for a village library. Not
more than one-tenth of the desirable
books issued from the press can be bought
because of lack of funds.
Don't Want the Building.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 2Lâ The resi
dents of South Berkeley have sent forth
loud protests in the last few days against
the selection by the Board of Education of
a buiiding on Ashlev avenue, formerly
occupied as a plumbing-shop, to be used
as a schoolroom. Their protests are based
on what they claim the insanitary con
dition of the building, its thin walls and
its uninviting appearance in general. Tae
matter will probably be brought betore the
board at their next meeting.
Co- Eds Received.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 21.â The young
lady members of the class of 00 at the
State University were tendered an in
formal reception this afternoon at Stiles
Hall by the members of the college Y. M.
C. A. About 150 were present.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1896.
A CHRISTIAN HOME
FOR PAGAN MAIDS,
Two Rescued Chinese Girls
in the Methodist
Mission.
ONE AN ATLANTA ESCAPE
At First They Feared They
Would Be Poisoned and So
Refused to Eat.
A LEGAL FIGHT PROBABLE.
Mrs. Hull Will Meet Opposition in Her
Endeavor to Secure Guardian
ship Letters.
Two of the three young and pretty Chi
nese maids, Tsoi Yee and Yuit Heung,
who were rescued from a Bartlett-street
den of vice Thursday evening are still
Toy Gum, Alias Tsoi Yee, and Yuit Hcung, Who Were Rescued From a
Bartlett-Allcy Den Last Thur-day Evening.
sheltered by the Methodist Chinese Mis
sion. The third, Yee Sing, has returned
to her life cl shame, the slave of Wong
Fook.
Immediately after the girls were taken
from the den by F. H. Holbrook and his
assistants they were removed to the mis
sion-bouse. It was evident that Yee Sing
was of age and her own guardian, conse
quently she could not be detained against
her wish.
The Christian converts of the mission
determined, however, that they would
coax her to remain with them. They
labored and petted her for half an hour,
but without result, and she wa3 finally al
lowed to go back to her old life.
"Yee Sing had no faith in me," said
Mrs. Hull last evening, "and even after I
had taken her out into the street she asked
me over and over again whether I was go
ing to cheat her and take her to the wrong
place. We took her to the mission home,
but were unable to allay her fears. I knew
it would not do to restrain her by force so
I took her back to Bartlett alley."
Tsoi Yee or, as Mr. Holbrook believes
h* to be, Toy Gum, one of the Atlanta
Exposition escapes, is, from an Oriental
standpoint, a beamy. She is a mere child
in years, and, although her owner alleges
that she is of age, the peculiar fashion she
uses in arranging her hair in a coil over
her right ear, the Chinese emblem of
youth, disproves this statement.
Both Tsoi Yee and Yuit Houng are be
coming accustomed to their new home. At
first they cried a good deal, but they soon
became contented. Chinese girls have
been taught for years by their owners that
they would be tortured if captured.
They expect to be poisoned or beaten
and otherwise abused, consequently it is
not to be wondered at when they cry and
fight on their arrival at the mission.
The young girls appeared to be satisfied
with their surroundings, and ate the food
placed before them last evening. During
the day they refused to eat, but as they
were tieated with the utmost kindness
and were not beaten or abused as they ex
pected to be, their fears departed by de.
greea, and they accepted the food offered
them.
Tsoi Yee is said to be valued at $2000,
and it is expected that her owners will
make strenuous efforts to recover her.
S^e still wears her rich silken and em
broidered garments, her golden rings and
bracelets and her dainty golden slippers.
If Mrs. Hull succeeds in obtaining letters
of guardianship her barbarous garments
will be taken from ncr and she will be
clothed in a gown becoming a Christian
girl. _ _________^__^

SEQUEL TO A LIBEL SUIT.
Board of Trade Ccmmiltes Will
Visit Elitor High of the
Times-Item.
Will Try to Persuade Him to Cease
His Present Methods of Express
ing His Opinions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 21. j
The regular monthly meeting of the
board of directors of the Board of Trade
was held in the exposition building this
afternoon.
Some routine business was transacted,
and tben the following resolution was
read:
The undersigned memÃers of the board-of
directors of the Oakland Board of Trade call
attention to the lollowins; facts, to wit:
That one Gavin Dhu High, publisher of what
is known as the Oakland Times and Evening
Item, appears upon the roll of membership of
the aforesaid Oakland Board of Trade.
That the said Gavin Dhu High has been con
victed by a jury of the crime of libel, and duly
sentenced therefor.
That the victim of High's crime is William
J. Dingee. one of Oakland's best and most pro
gressive citizens, who is now being personally
villifltfd in the said publications, and who
does not deserve the untrue and vicious at
tacks, and we believe that the time has ar
rived to place the stamp of our disapproval
upon the said Hiph's conduct, and we ask that
a meeting of the directors of the Board of
Trade be had at once to expel from the associ
ation the said Gavin Dhu High.
A. H. Breed said he did not believe in
such attacks upon Oakland interests, but
so far as the personal matter between High
and Dincee was concerned he was not in
favor of taking any action. He was will
ing to be one of a committee to ask High
to desist from publishing anything detri
mental to the interests! of Oakland.
Mr. Keller said he did not care to enter
into a personal matter between High and
Dingee, but he was willing to atand up for
Oakland against ah comers.
On motion of A. D. Pr.yal a committee
of three was appointed to see Mr. High
and request him, as a member of the
board, to desist from attacks upon Oak
land's interests. The committee consists
of President James P. Taylor, A. D. Pryal
and A. H. Breed. The committee will ap
peal to the Merchants' Exchan c to unite
with them to stop Mr. High's methods.
A letter from Congressman Grove L.
Johnson was read, in which he promised
his support to any measure presented by
Congressman Hilborn looking to the im
provement of the Oakland harbor.

WAR AGAINST
THE NEWSBOY.
Not to Get On or Off Street
cars While They Are
in Motion.
TRADE CHANNEL CLOSED
Market-Street Railway Company
Has Issued Thousands
of Copies.
THEY BITTERLY COMPLAIN
Youthful Bread-Makers Assert That
the New Law Has Diminished
Their Receipts.
The useful newsboy, the youngster who
sells his papers on the street and who is
often the only support of infirm or aged
parents, is again the victim of adverse leg
islation.
This time It is the Board of Supervisors
which, presumably at the instance of the
Market-street Railway Company, recently
passed an ordinance prohibiting boys from
getting on or off streetcars while in mo
tion. That great corporation has evi
dently determined to crush the young
bread-makers who took such a prominent
part in the transfer war.
It would not be quite as severe on the
newsboys if they were only prohibited
from getting on the car while it was in
motion, but many of them complain that
the conductors, on the strength of this
ordinance, even refuse to give them an
opportunity to enter the car when it is at
a standstill.
In consequence one of th c channels of
newsboys' trade is completely closed.
Their income is reduced, and meager as it
was prior to the passage of the ordinance,
it is now considerably less.
The ordinance which Is causing the
complaint among the news-sellers is as
follows:
: MAKKET-SREET RAILWAY COMPANY. :
Notice is hereby given that Order No. 1694 :
: of the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco ;
: makes it unlawful for boys to get on or off :
: streetcars wt. lie in motion. ;
: Any boy violating said order la liable to :
: arrest, tine and imprisonment.
The Market-street Railway Company
has issued thousands of copies of the or
dinance, printed on small slips of card
board, to the streetcar conductors. In
turn the conductors distribute them to
the newsboys. A boy with a bundle of
papers will swing ou a passing car for the
purpose of gathering in, it possible, a
stray nickel. Before he has time to thor
oughly brace himself on the car, however,
he is banded a copy of the ordinance.
The car is either stopped to allow him
to get off or he swings off while it is in
motion. He therefore loses in all proba
bility a n.ckel or so, and in addition
plainly violates one of the clauses in tbe
ordinance. He has jumped from a car, as
he has been used to do for years, and is a
transgressor of the law liable to fine and
imprisonment.
A prison is a miserable place in the
newsboy's mind, and in case of arrest but
few can .pay a tine, and consequently the
cell is the only alternative.
The youngsters are very bitter against
tbe new ordinance, or at least against its
new phase, which results in his having a
printed card placed in his hand instead of
a nickel in exchange for nis paper. But
they are powerless to prevent it; they are
all poor and young and incapable of com
batting the millions of a railroad corpora
tion.
DEWEY QUICKLY GOBBLED.
From tbe Fourth Kstate, August 13.
The Fourth Estate exclusively an
nounced in its last issue the resignation of
John C. Dawey, for nearly fourteen years
identified with J. H. Bates' and Lyman D.
Morse's advertising agencies.
Mr. Dewey's valuable services have been
quickly secured under a liberal offer mnde
by the Bates-Whitman Company, adver
tising specialists, whose business already
requires the entire fourteenth floor space
of the Vanderbilt building. Both parties
are receiving congratulations on the for
mation of the new relations.
John C. Dewey was born "in the fifties"
in New Haven. In 1878 he entered the ad-
John C. Dewey.
vertising business and quickly found a
place near the "top," which he has since
maintained, being most of the time with
J. H. Bates ana his successor, Lyman D.
Morso. Last week he resigned with the
intention of entering the general advertis
ing agency field on his own account, as
stated in this paper.
Probably J. C. Dewey has placed to ad
vantage of the advertiser contracts to as
large an amount and has made as many
friends and as few enemies as any
other person in the business. "J.
C., as many advertising men term
him, is said to have possessed â  the
happy faculty of "turning down" a so
licitor and yet permitting the latter to
leave with a feeling in his mind as though
he had parted with his best friend.
Mr. Dewey intends to open his desk
with the Bates-Whitman Company in the
near future, as soon as Mr. Morse can

SAYS SUTER IS IN ERROR
Street Superintendent Denies the
Sewerage System Is Depend
ent on Oakland Harbor.
Chairman Forderer Wants the Tax
Levy to Be $iâThis Will Require
the Pruning-Knife.
AL,AMEDA, Cal., Aug. 21.â Street
Superintendent Frodden says that Colonel
Suter is in error when he says the sewage
from Alameda contaminates the tidal
canal, and that it is dependent on the
tidal canal and tbe Oakland harbor.
"The sewage of Alameda," he said,
"does not approach the canal within a
mile, and the system is not at all depend
ent on the harbor of Oakland. It ie only
a question of diverting the outlet of two
sewers in this city and to carry them to
the channel south of the city, or beyond
the marsh at the West End into deep
water.
"The system of the city is in no way de
pendent on the harbor of Oakland, nor
does the sewage contaminate the water in
the canal. The tanneries in East Oakland
are th^ cause of the stench on both sides
of the Park-street bridge, as I have always
maintained. There is no way of flushing
the harbor or the canal save by cutting
tin- canal through to San Leandro Bay, as
originally devised."
The Next Tax Levy.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 21.â A good deal
of speculation is being indulged in by in
terested parties as to what the next levy
will be fixed at by the City Trustees. All
the members are anxious to keep it as low
as possible, but they are met with a con
siderable reduction of nearly a million
dollars in the assessment, and the fact that
municipal bonds amounting to over $6000
have to be paid off this year. The present
outlook is for the levy to be fixed at $1 10.
Chairman Forderer holds, however, that
the tax should not be over $1 and is work
ing towarrt that end.
If the $1 limit be determined on the
pruning-knife will be applied to all de
partments in the city government with a
possible shrinkage in salaries as a conse
quence.
Preparing for Admission Day.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 21.â The Native

PRISON GATE HOME FARM
The Salvation Army Likely to
Receive a Donation of
Land.
The Balvation Army is in a fair way to
receive a donation which will aid it ma
terially in its rescue work. A wealthy
friend of the army holds a mortgage upon
300 acres of farm land under high cultiva
tion and provided with a number of dwell
ing-houses, barns and outbuildings. The
property is locatea near Lafayette, in the
San Ramon Valley, above Martinez. The
mortgage will run out on the Ist of 'Octo
ber, ana if the land is not redeemed by
that date a foreclosure will be taken and
tbe property donated to the army for a
prison-gate home.
Adjutant McFee, who has charge of the
prison work of the army, is jubilant at the
prospect of getting a place in which to
receive discharged prisoners and prepare
them for re-entry into the world of work
ingmen. At the same time ne is not
counting his chickens before they are
hatched.
"I don't feel like making any plans,"
he said last night," until i know for cer
tain that tbe farm is going to come into
our possession. Once it is ours, we shall
get to work without delay and I hope
make the institution self-supporting.
"We have several capable farmers in our
ranks, notably one man from Kentucky,
who is a perfect encyclopedia of practical
and theoretical knowledge on the subject.
These men will have tbe place in charge,
and if they do not make a success of it
nobody can. Bat we must get the place
before we can make plans for its manage
ment. The coming Ist ot October will
settle the business one way or the other,
I hope and trust, in our favor."

FOX PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, or OHIO
FOR TICF-PREBIDENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Et-KCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Bryan can only say of his invasion of
the East: "I came, I saw and I decided to
quit."
It seems Bryan ha decided to let Sewall
and Watson light i. out between them
selves.
There is no longer a Solid South, and
Bryan hasn't even that much of a base to
build on.
You never hear of a Business Man's
Bryan Club nor of a Workingman's Free
trade Ciub.
The Democrats will never dodge the
tariff issue until they succeed in dodging
the country.
Paying wages in 50-cent dollars may
suit the free-traders, but it won't suit the
workingmen.
Since the action taken by the gold Dem
ocrats of Kentucky we may count that
State for McKinley.
If there were nothing else to drive Popu
lists from the Bryan camp. Democratic
trickery would do it.
There is really no chance for Democrats
this year. The people are not going to
vote for another panic.
The gold Democrats of Kentucky have
not put up much of a platform, but it will
do as a roost for Carlisle.'
The unemployed men of this country
demand work and wages, and Democracy
tells them that isn't an issue.
After three years of Democratic condi
tions, what tbe average man needs most is
a cbance to earn some money.
Sewall's son has come out for McKinley,
and it seems the old man cannot carry
his family, much less his State.
The best campaign literature of the can
vass has been furnished by McKinley in
his short speeches to workingmen.
The So-day Call of to-morrow will be
full of good things, and the way to make
sure of getting it is to leave orders for it
to-day.
So far from talking this year about
"opening the world's market," the aver
age Democrat would wait around a block
to avoid hearing of it.
The Democrats were as enthusiastic for
Cleveland four years ago as they are now
for Bryan, and in four years more they
will be denouncing Bryan as they now
denounce Cleveland.
The plan of fusion devised between the
Democrats and the Populisti of this State
puts a very thin coating on the Sewall
pill, and it will take a very tough-throated
Populist to swallow it.
When the Democrats enacted the Wil
son tariff they put a tariff issue before this
country that will stay there as long as
that mill-closing, deiicit-making measure
remains on the statute- books.
There never was a statesman in this
country in closer touch with workingmen
than William McKinley, nor one more
keenly interested in advancing their work,
their wages and their welfare.
The difficulty in the way of fusion be
tween Democrats and Populists is that the
Democrats wish to be trusted in every
thing and the Populists know them too
well to trust them in anything.
The veterans of the Grand Army may be
relied upon to know what is the best for
the Republic they fought to save, and
nearly every one of them is a supporter of
McKinley and the Republican party.
As Boston papers are noted for the
classic accuracy of their epithets, it is
worth while calling attention to the state
ment of the Herald of that city that
Bryan's New York speech was "a fizzle."
Four years ago the Democrats promised'
that if Cleveland were elected wheat would
rise to $1 25 per bushel, and as it is now
worth 50 cents the farmers can very easily
figure out just what a Democratic promise
is worth.
From all parts of tbe West and South
come reports of thi unwillingness of Dem
ocrats to deal fairly with the Populists
and the Teller Republicans, and an a con
sequence the chances of fusion grow
weaker every day.
A new weekly. The Linguist, has just
been launched in this City, and is to be
published in English, Spanish, Italian
ana Slavonian. The initial number, which
has just been issued, presents a good ap
pearance and gives promise of developing
into an important and useful periodical to
Â» large number of readers.
THE PLAN OF FUSION.
The plan of fusion by which the Demo
cratic leaders of this State hope to capture
the Populist vote for Bryan has at last
been made public. It proposes an elect
oral ticket on which there are to be five
Democrats pledged to Bryan and Sewall
and four Populists pledged to Bryan and
Watson. The Populist who votes the
ticket will therefore give five votes for
Sewall to four for Watson, and will help
to put the millionaire banker above the
farmer in the vote of the Electoral College.
Whether this form of fusion will be sat
isfactory to *ny large number of Popu
lists remains to be seen. Certainly it will
not be pleasing to those earnest men who
have made the party what it is and who
care more for principle- than for the spoils
of office. This was made manifest by the
action of John S. Dore, one of the Popu
list members of the conference committee,
who positively refused to approve tbe pro
posed plan of fusion and stood out with
unshaken loyalty for the ticket which the
Populists at the St. Louis convention had
offered to the country.
There can be no question that the Popu
lists at the St. Louis convention went as
far as self-respecting men could do toward
establishing a system of co-operation with
Democracy during the campaign. They
placed at the head of their ticket the head
of the Democratic ticket. They fashioned
their platform as near to that of the
Democrats as could be done without
making it a travesty on Populism. In re
turn for this they asked only that the
Vice-Presidency should be given to the
Populists. They named as their candi
date for that oilice a man who, to say the
least of it, is more eminent in politics
than Sewall, and has cut a far greater fig
ure in National affairs. No breath of
scandal or suspicion assails the character
of Watson or nis reputation for honesty
and honor either in public or private life,
and no objection therefore on the score of
personal fitness can be urged by the sup
porters of Bryan against the acceptance
of the Populist candidate for the second
place on the ticket.
If it had been the intention of the Demo
cratic leaders to deal in any way fairly
with the Populists and the Teller Repub
licans they would long ere this have
shown some willingness to accept tbe
generous terms of co-operation offered
them at St. Louis. If Sewall cared for the
cause more than for bis own prestige and
for the notoriety the campaign will bring
him he would at once have stepped aside
gracefully and made way for the leaders
of his party to accept the St. Louis plan of
fusion. This would have brought about a
co-operation of the two parties in a spirit
of temporary harmony, and might have
given tbe combination a chance of success
at the polls.
Trder no circumstances is a permanent
alliance between Democracy and Populism
possible. They might combine for a cam
paign, but they could not unite to conduct
a government. Even on the silver ques
tion the views of the two parties are only
seemingly in agreement. This fact Has
been well known to the abler leaders of
both parties, and has made them half
hearted in their efforts at fusion. No true
union can be brought about, and the best
thing the Populists can do is. to put up a
ticket of their own and make a straight
fight for the principles they believe in.
HOW TO MAKE $100,000,000.
There is a plank in the platform of the
Republican party which should be of deep
interest to the farmers. It says: "Tbe
Republican party favors such protection
as will lead to the production on Ameri
can soil of all the sugar which tbe American
people use, and for which we are sending
abroad annually more than ?100,000,000 to
foreign countries."
The meaning of this declaration is that
the $100,000,000 which we send abroad
every year to pay for sugar should go into
the pockets of American farmers. There
are localities that are not favorable to the
growing of sugar material, but they are
not many; besides, if localities which are
so adapted were encouraged to raise sugar
beets more especially the regions in which
grain is more indigenous to the soil would
have less competition, and hence all agri
culturists would be materially benefited.
The soil of California is well adapted to
sugar beets, and were the industry ex
tended to the utmost a very large percent
age of the 5100,000,000 now going abroad
annually to pay for sugar would be dis
tributed among the farmers of this State.
Moreover large production of sugar in Cal
ifornia would stimulate all manufacturing
enterprises in which sugar enters as one of
the materials, such as in fruit preserving.
And, again, the tendency of sugar-beet
culture would be to cut large tracts of land
into small farms, which would add very
materially to the population by immigra
tion.
With so much additional money thrown
into Ibe avenues of business there would
be increased activity in every line of trade,
and it would be permanent. That is to
say, if the sugar-beet industry in this State
were developed to its uttermost, not only
would the annual volume of general busi
ness be greatly increased, but it would be
a permanent eain. However, all this is
contingent upon a system of protection
and bounty laws, such as is promised by
tbe Republican party, and, it may be said,
the only way to make California a great
sugar-producing country is for the people
to approve the St. Louis platform by elect
ing Major McKinley, for Mr. Bryan is on
record as saying that he reparda the en
couragement of sugar-beet culture by pro
tection and bounty as little better than
highway robbery.
THE REVOLT.
The so-called gourd-money wing of the
Democratic party is developing surprising
numerical strength in all the States. It
is now claimed that at least forty-two of
the States will be represented in the
Indianapolis convention, but it is not
cerUin that a ticket will be nominated.
The sentiment appears to be growing that
the convention should declare the plat
form and candidates of the Chicago con
vention are anti - Democratic, and then
call upon Democrats everywhere to give
their support to McKinley as the safest
and surest way to release their own party
from the grasp of the Altgelds. It is
claimed by some of the leaders that every
true Democrat could better afford to sup
port their old enemy, the Republican
party, for this one time than to let the
Altgelds get permanent control of the
machinery of the party, which Bryan's
election would give them.
Colonel Breckinridge voiced the senti
ments of the anti- Bryan Democracy in his
Louisville speech last Thursday when he
said "the duty of the Democratic party is
to defeat Bryan." It is a curious state of
things when a party sets out to defeat it
self, but there is lo doubt at ail that the
Chicago convention tried to turn the
party 'B back upon the principles and tra
ditions of the party and depart as far as
possible from all former declarations.
The strongest argument that is made
against Democrats supporting Bryan is
the admission of the regularity oi the Chi
cago convention coupled with the denial
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1896.
of the right of the convention to pledge
the members of the party to principles
which the Democracy came into existence
to battle against. k
The Louisville gatherine was made up
of "the old wheel horses" of the party,
and its action is the equivalent of an ad
mission that Kentucky will give her elec
toral vote to McKinley. But tbe same
determination of the old-line Democrats
xn Kentucky to defeat Bryan not only pre
vails among the old leaders of tbe party in
all the States, but it is growing stronger
among the rank and file everywhere. A
fortnight ago even those who were the bit
terest in their opposition to the nominees
of the Chicago convention were not very
outspoken, but the fashion now is for one
to go out of his way to denounce plattorm,
candidates and all the other work of the
convention. If the sentiment against
Bryan in his own party keeps growing he
will scarcely get 20 per cent of the elec
toral vote. It is noticeable that very few
of the distinguished and influential men
of the party are favorable to his election.
CHAIRMAN JONES ANGRY.
Chairman Jones of .Bryan's managing
committee says he has made the discovery
that the Chicago newspapers under favor
able circumstances can print falsehoods.
The trouble with Jones is nearly all the
great Democratic dailies are urging the
people to defeat Bryan. Had only a few
bolted the nomination it would be differ
ent, but when BUDstantially the party's
entire press insists that the election of the
party's candidate would be the greatest
calamity that could happen the people
there must be something very rotten and
very dangerous in such candidacy.
Jones, by command of the Bryan family
and contrary to his own best judgment,
has removed the National Committee's
headquarters to Chicago, where every
newspaper of consequence is opposing his
candidate's election. Naturally he is not
quite as happy as he would like to be, but
what is more distressing is the admission
the removal makes that the entire East is
sure for Major McKinley and that Bryan's
only hope lies in carrying the West and
South. "Claim everything" was Jones'
original programme, and with such a dec
laration for the rallying and booming cry
Washington would be tbe natural head
quarters, but he had to yield to the "un
developed and emotional young man,'
and in his wrath he pilches into the news
papers. .
But the anti-Bryan newspapers do not
need to lie, nor do they need to tell more
than half of the calamities that would
fall upon the country were Bryan elected,
to give the people enough eye-openers to
let them pee for themselves that Mr.
Bryan is trying to bring about a collision
between labor and capital. One-half the
opposition of the man to everything
that is calculated to protect farmer, wage
earner, mill, factory, ahop and society
against hostile invasion of their rights is
ail that need be told to make all true
Americans take up arms (the ballot)
against him. It is the truth and not the
falsehoods which the Chicago newspapers
are telling that hurts Chairman Jones'
feelings. Mr. Jones was a proud, stiff
necked Southern Bourbon Democrat until
he fell in with Tillman, Bryan and Alt
geld, and he is making tne mistake of
running a Popocratic campaign on lines
he used to employ when he was shouting
for John C. Breckinridge.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THOSE JAPANESE STEAMSHIP LINES
Why Not Deal as Liberallly With Oub
Own Citizens as With Foreigners?
To tlie Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear
Sir: The officials of the various Japanese
steamship lines which are about to absorb the
trade of the Pacific Ocean must feel inwardly
a contempt for the business acumen and pat
riotism of the people of this country when
every seaDort on this coast has bowed down
before them and impiored them with cringiug
mien to make it a terminal point.
They came, no doubt, prepared to find our
people antagonistic to foreign invasion. In
stead, they ti mi that they have only to askâ or
rather, demand â what they want and boards
of trade, chambers of commerce, etc. . tumble
over one another in their haste to outdo each
other lv their offers.
Is it possible that we cannot see the danger
when its presence is thrust before our eyes in
such an unmistakable fashion? Are we so
blind to our own future as to supplement the
efforts of the Japanese to control the trade of
the Pacific Ocean by welcoming them without
stretched hands? Yet we are crying for pro
tection against their industries; we are trying
to blow hot and cold in the same breath. Can
not we realize that wÂ« ere, by our present at
titude toward thess steamship companies
hammering nails into a coflin to bury the last
vestige of American merchant marine on the
Pacific Ocean? For God's sake, let us get off our
knees and stan3 up like men. If we.have any
bonuses to pay or cargo to guarantee or free
docks or lrtie anything to offerâ offer it to
American owners. Plead with our own Gov
ernment to counteract the action of tbe Jap
anese empire by dealing as liberally with our
own citizens in the matter of subsidies. Give
our sailors a chance to live, or our boys a
chance to live as sailors. Keep the freight
money to spend in this country: srlve our ship
yards a show, and don't let this century go out
with the Japanese flag flying over ail the
steamships trading in the Pacific Ocean.
We invited the Chinese to our shores and
then made it a National issue to drive them
away. Do we want this history repeated?

or two ago was Dr. A. Milliken of Susanville,
Lassen County, who years ago was located at
Halfmoon Bay. Dr. Milliken has been at Su
sanville for the last eight years. He has come
down now for quite a stay, as he needs a
change alter his long residence on the plains
of Lassen.
The doctor says that things are not active in
that part of tbe State.
"If we had a railroad," said he, "we would
have the liveliest kind of a country, but we
have to go by wagon for a long distance before
we get to a railroad.
"We have got a county there 60 miles wide
Dy about 240 long and in the whole of it there
are 3000 people. Eight huudred of these iive
in Susanville.
"There is a lot of good grain and fruit land
there, but prices for products are low. Some
Dr. A. Milliken, Who Has Arrived From tbe Plains of Lassen After a Long
Absence.
[Sketched from life by a "Call 1 ' artist.]
farmers have to drive their stock and haul
their grain 100 miles. That is a great deal of a
hardship.
"If we had a system of irrigation such as the
rich plains require it would be a great thing.
But it would cost a very large sum. The Ep.gle
Lake irrigation enterprise that has been be
lore the people was not pushed through for
I want of sufficient funds, and it wiU be a long
I time probably before it is put through.
"I think it is safe to say that it would take
$150,000 to do it, The lake is 1000 feet above
Susanville, and unless the water was tapped
and controlled just right it would flood all of
Honey Lake and prove another Jamestown
affair.
"It is lucky that the work has not been at
tempted if it could not be well done. The
water has such a prodigious fall and there is
so much of it that there is a good deal of
science in the problem of the best means of
handling it.
"No, just now the population of Lassen is
not increasing. It's a good country, with not
only a rich soil, but there are enormous areas
of magnificent sugar pine, fir and other
timber." ___^___^^___
PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF THE MOON
TO-NIGHT.
It frequently happens that when a total
eclipse of the sun is not of long duration it is
preceded or lollowed by a partial lunar eclipse.
Two weeks ago, when the moon's shadow,
within a few degrees of its descending node,
swept over the northern hemisphere, the
earth's shadow was directed to within a few
degrees of the opposite or ascending node of
its satellite's 01 bit, and as it has a compar
atively slow angular motion, it has not yet
gone very far beyond the node and is within
the ecliptic limits. The moon in the mean
time having traveled half-wav round the
ecliptic passes the ascending node at noon to
day and before midnight will have overtaken
the shadow of its primary, the earth, thus re
verting the positions they held with regard to
the sun on the Bth of this month, when the
solar eclipse occurred.
To terrestrial observers these counter
changes produce entirely different results. In
the opposition from the sun the cone-shaped
sfTadow of the earth projects into space to a
distance of 857,000 miles, or nearly four times
the distance of the moon. At night wo are at
the base of this shadow, but of the iurther por
tion would know noihine except from theory
if the moon never invaded its ploom. At 8:OC
this evening when the full moon is far to the
east, near the boundaries of the constellations
of Aquarius and Capricornus it will enter the
penumbra or region of partial sunlight, and
before an hour has passed those familiar with
its aspect will readily detect a change in its
radiance.
As the diagram explains first contact with
the darker umbra takes place at 9:24 and
shortly afterwards it will be evident to any ob
server that the east edge of the lunar disk 101
degrees from its north point is assuming the
gibbous phase usually seen two nights before
lull moon.
Even with low magnifying power it may be
seen that the dark crater Grimadi is lost to

of the Moon at First Contact, Middle of Eclipse and Last Contact.
view, while soon the dark rays of Copernicus
and the brilliantly white crater of Aristarchus
assume a somber tint and finally disappear in
the encroaching shadow which advances over
the central plains and mountains and before
11 p. m. reaches the western lunar limb. One
fourth of the disk on the north side escapes
the umbra and shines crescent-shaped with
the scarcely noticeable dimness caused by the
penumbra.
If in imagination we place ourselves on
some of the lunar hills we will find that the
earth's disk, four times the diameter of the
moon, is obstructing sunlight partly from the
crescent and completely from the darkened
section. . .
To return to an earthly standpoint, it is
found that even in a partial lunar eclipse the
sunlight refracted through tbe earth's atmos
phere faintly illumines the shadowed part of
the moon's disk, as was noticeable in the par
tial eclipse of January 15, 1889.
This affords an opportunity of studying
light when it has passed through redoubled
layers of terrestr al atmosphere and thus ob
taining of it an effective spectrum.
At the central phase, the occultation of
small stars may be discerned and an exact ob
servation of this kind is an aid in the determi
nation of the moon's true position.
Half Hn hour past midnight our satellite
will emerge from the umbra, the last contact
occurring 27 dest. west of the south point, and
before 2 o'clock it will shine in the western
heavens with its usual radiance, having left
the earth's shadow completely behind. Even
without magnifying 1 power these phases can
be distinctly seen if the night be clear; and
though these interesting phenomena have not
the scientific value of a total solar eclipse,
they are always worthy of attention and ob
servation. Rose O'Halloran.

John Brown's Burial Plat, in Which the Remains of Kate Field
Are to Be Interred.
[From a photograph.]
When the letter was received by the
local representative of the Southern Pa
cific Company it was referred to WelU,
Fargo & Co. President Valentine was
absent at the time, but Assistant Manager
Rowell forwarded the communication to
his superior. A prompt answer came
from Mr. Valentine to the effect that the
express company would be pleased to
transport the remains of Kate Field from
San Francisco to any point in the United
States which the company reached.
It now remained "only to arrange for
transportation from Honolulu to this City,
and this matter was referred by tne South
ern Pacific officials, who had the affair in
hand, to the proper representative of the
Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany, and a favorable reply is confidently
expected from the latter company in a day
or two at the farthest.
To the story of why these two charac
ters, ao widely different in many respects,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1896.
should be interred in one plot attaches a
sad romance.
It is history that the famou a liberator,
who hailed from the forests and mountains
of the Adirondacks, expressed the wish
during his lifetime that he should be bur
ied in the grounds on which stood his
home, built by his own hands from tim
ber felled and prepared by him.
This tract of land was purchased in 1870
by a company for the purpose of perpetu
ating the memory of the martyr, and Kate
Field, Henry Clews, Le Grand B. Cannon,
Hon. Thomas Murphy, Hon. Salem H.
Wales, Isaac H. Bailey, Charles Stewart
Smith and George Cabot Wood were con
tributors to the fund. This property stood
in tbe name of Henry Clews as trustee
until the 21st of July, when it was for
mally transferred to the State of New
York. At the same time the monument
erected to the memory of John Brown,
and which bears the names of those who
donated the land to the State, was un
veiled amid impressive ceremonies.
Writing of this event to the Elite, a soci
ety journal of Chicago, Mary Stuart Arm
strong says:
"John Brown is not the only hero to be
laid at rest upon the North Elba Hill. It
is the purpose of some of Kate Field's
friends to carry with tenderness the mor
tal remains of this gifted woman to the
park and to have them repose there ac
cording to her oft-expressed wish. It is
touching to see how many of the veterans
of the Adirondacks loved Kate Field.
They tell incidents of her visits there
which evidence her remarkable kindness
and justness, while tears fill their eyes or
fall from off their ruddy cheeks. It was
she who made John Brown's desire to be
buried there a fact. We shall see to it
that her wish is likewise fulfilled."
Near the spot where John Brown's body
lies stands the Dig bowlder upon which he
had cut his initials when endeavoring to
establish a colony for fugitive slaves there,
who were to arrive by the underground
railway. The same writer and friend of
/
Kate Field mentioned previously lays of
the locality and of the idea she is now
endeavoring to carry out:
"The soot is a picturesque one â at the
foot of the steeper side the turbulent
waters of the Au Sable flow. No more
suitable resting place could be chosen for
all that is mortal of Miss Field. To be laid
there will help to preserve her name and
keep alive her memory."
It is expected that all the arrangements
for the removal of the body from its rest
ing place in Honolulu and its transporta
tion to the Adirondacks will be completed
by the time the next steamer sails for that
port. ____________
Will Aid the Socialists.
The Pacific Coast Fresco Painters' Union
last evening passed resolutions indorsing
the actions of the Socialist Labor party,
extending to the socialists its sympathy
and offering them both moral and finan
cial aid. Fol lowing are the resolutions:
Whereas, The Socialist Labor party of San
Francisco is engaged in a war against capital
ism in behalf of the workers of the Nation,
and has by its fearless speech and acts aroused
the hostility of the fleecers of labor who are
endeavoring through their paid tools, the po
lice of San Francisco, to stifle socialist agita
tion by depriving Socialists of the right of free
speech, arresting their speakers and breaking
up their street meetings, we, the Pacific Coast
Fresco Painters' Union, do view with alarm
the unmasked tyranny of this attempt to over
throw the fundamental law of our country;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That we do hereby offer to the
Socialist Labor party our heartfelt sympathy,
and tender them our support, both moral and
financial; be it further
Resolved, That we uphold the Socialist Labor
party in its honest endeavor to educate the
masses for the common good, and will do all
in our nower, morally and financially, for the
cause of socialism.
FAVORING THE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC,
Curious Figures From the
State Board of Equal
ization.
IN MOREHOUSFS NAME.
How Its Assessment Per Mile
Compares With the Central
Pacific.
A STAETLING DISCREPANCY.
The Reports to the Auditor Are Signed
by Chairman Morehouse
Alone.
Auditor Broderick received a communi
cation from the State Board of Equalisa
tion yesterday that will prove very
interesting to those who are familiar with
the history and inside workings of the
Southern and Central Pacific railroads and
may be the cause of some very searching
questions being asked the board and par
ticularly Chairman Morehouse.
Brief dispatches from Sacramento pub
lished in the San Francisco papers on the
4th inst. announced that the valuation of
the Southern Pacific Company's property
for assessment purposes had been in
creased by several hundred thousand
dollars, and that the valuation of other
roads had been slightly decreased. No
mention was made of the most interesting
portion of the board's action relating to
the assessments of valuation of the various
roads per mile or of the startling dis
crepancy between the valuation plafeed on
the Southern and Central Pacific com
panies' property per mile.
The document received by the Auditor
stated that on August 3 the board had
considered the railroad assessments and
had fixed that of the Southern Pacific at
$16,573,334 on 1770.95 miles within the
State, oi which 7.36 miles are within the
City and County of San Francisco. The
report on this company concludes as fol
lows:
The assessed value per mile of said railway,
as fixed by a pro rata distribution per mile of
the assessed value of the whole franchise, rail
way roadbed, rails and rolling stock of such
railway of the said company within this State
is $9358 44.
The portion of the road within this City
and county must pay taxes on $38,878.
In reference to the Central Pacific the
board reports that it has placed tbe total
valuation at $13,000,000 on 746.76 miles of
road within the State of California, of
which 2.46 miles are within the City and
County of San Francisco, and on which
taxes must be paid on $42,825. The valua
tion per mile is placed at $17,408 53.
The figures which stand out conspicu
ously in the report are those relating to
the valuation per mile, the difference be
ing $8050 09 per mile in favor of the South
ern Pacific.
In view of the well-known fact that the
Southern Pacific is far better built and
equipped than the Central Pacific these
figures are looked upon as very remark
able, particularly in view of the fact that
the San Francisco and San Mateo road,
with its simple equipment and inexpensive
roadbed, is assessed at $5788 99 per mile.
Perhaps the queerest thine about the
report is the manner in which it is signed.
The pages relating to the Southern and
Central 'Pacific companies have spaces at
the Uottom for the signatures of all of the
members of the board, but in each instance
the only name that appears is that of
Chairman Morehouse, apparently showing
that Messrs. Arnold, Beamer and Chese
brough, the other members, eitherbad no
hand in the making up of the figures or
did not approve of them.
The law requires that the State Board of
Equalization must assess the railroads and
transmit the results of their deliberations
to the Auditor so that the necessary por
tions can be inserted in the Assessor's
books before they leave his hands.
APPEAL OF THE CLERKS,
Dry-Good^ Salesmen Look for
Support From Various
Organizations.
They Repudiate a Spurious Circular
That Injures Friendly Houses.
Ladies May Be Members.
The Retail Dry-goods Clerks Association
held a meeting last night in K. R. B. Hall
and showed that they were deeply inter
ested in the early closing movement.
Jerome Donovan occupied the chair, and
the hall was well filled with members of
the association.
Tne executive committee in a report
submitted to the meeting stated that it
had decided to ask the Women's Federa
tion and the Women's Christian Temper
ance Union to appoint a committee to
visit the principal dry-goods houses and
secure, i f possible, the signatures of the
proprietors to an agreement to close their
stores at 6 r. m. every night in the week.
The following form of agreement was
recommended :
We the undersigned, agree to close our
stores on Saturday at 6 p.m., provided other
principal dry-goods houses do likewise.
Mrs. Clarkson was appointed to wait on
the ladies.
A form of petition was also drafted to
be distributed among fraternal and labor
organizations asking their co-operation:
We, the undersigned, desiring to aid the
Retail Clerks in their endeavor to secure the
closing of nil dry-goods stores at G o'clock
Saturday evenings, do agree to use all honor
able means to influence our friends and the
public in general to do their trading before
6 o'clock.
The report was unanimously adopted as
progressive.
The question of admitting the sales
women to membership was discussed at
considerable length. A motion that was
laid over from the former meeting, to the
effect that the ladies be admitted as mem
bers with obligations to the society simi
lar to those of the men regarding dues,
was amended variously. The original
motion was withdrawn in favor of an
amendment that the ladies be admitted to
membership, with dues fixed at half the
regular rate. This was carried without a
single dissenting vote.
A committee of five on membership to
visit the various dry-goods stores and
urge salesmen to attend the meetings and
work in behalf of the movement was
appointed. T. Quinlan, D. J. Costello, A.
Lowenstein, D. McGarrity and George R.
Sullivan were selected for this duty.
A circular purporting to come from the
saleswomen of San Francisco and contain
ing resolutions on the early closing ot
dry-goods stores was read. It created
considerable excitement, as it included
J. J. O'Brien and Kohlberg, Strauss &
Frohman among the stores that kept open
after 6 p. sr.
Tne fact is those houses close early and
are the strongest friends of the clerks in
their fieht for early closing. The associ
tion consequently repudiated the circular
as a spurious and hurtful document.

WINTHROP'S TRIAL SET,
On September I He Will Be
Brought to Bar on a
Charge of Robbery.
Granted a Stay of Ten Days in Con
formity With a Supreme
Court Decision.
Judge Wallace yesterday gave O. W.
Winthrop until September 1 in which to
prepare for trial. District Attorney
Barnes desired to have the case set for
Tuesday next, but the attorneys for the
defense opposed it. They presented an
affidavit signed by the prisoner in which
the history of the casÃ was reviewed, and
it was set forth that undue haste had been
employed in bringing him to trial.
It was also complained that Winthrop
is absolutely unprepared for trial. He
says he has been kept in close confine
ment and few persons allowed to see him.
Winthrop also charged that the police
have given out untrue stories about him
in order to prejudice the people against
him. He alleged that this would make it
impossible to secure a jury that would try
him fairly.
Besides the general complaint against
the police force the matter of bail was re
ferred to. The fact that Wintlirop is a
poor man was cited and the amount of
bail set by the court, $30,000, was alleged
to be out of all proportion and impossible
of procurement. A stay of thirty days
was asked.
Mr. Barnes quoted the Bupreme Court
decision in the Fredericks case, which
held that ten days is sufficient time in
which to prepare for trial, and pointed out
tne fact that Winthrop has already had
eleven days.
Judge Wallace in deciding upon the
question said that there were no specific
charges in the defendant's affidavit and no
reason advanced why thirty days should
be allowed. He would follow the rule laid
down by the Supreme Court, he said, and
grant a continuance of ten days.
Winthrop was placed in the custody of
the Sheriff until Tuesday, September 1.
Becker and Creegan, the notorious
forgers, were up for sentence Defore the
Winthrop case was called, but the matter
went over until August 28.
Daniel Linenan, an old man, wTTo has
six prior convictions against him, was
sent to San Quentin for riiteen years for
stealing a dirty shirt and an old pair of
shoes. The jury recommended him to the
mercy of the court, but the prior convic
tions rendered the recommendation in
effective. Linphan's request that he be
sent to San Quentin was granted.
Georee Brighton, the diminutive house
breaker, who recently tried to escape from
Judge Wallace's courtroom, was sent to
San Quentin for two and a half years for
attempted burglary. Frank Ballard was
given a similar sentence for a similar
offense.
The trial of Mrs. Susie B. Martin for
murder was set for October 5.
WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS.
They Held Their First Informal Recep
tion Last Evening.
The first informal reception by the
Woman's Suffrage Association was held
last evening in the Parrott building. The
State Central Committee acted as a recep
tion committee, and prominent among
them were Mrs. A. A. Sargent, Mrs. Nel
lie Holbrook-Blinn, Mrs. Austin Sperry
and Miss May G. Hay.
The object of these gatherings is to give
all those interested in the movement an
opportunity to meet the leaders thereof
and exchange ideas. As many are unable
to attend gatherings held in the daytime
the time was set from 8 to 10 o'clock on
the first and third Thursday evenings of
the month nntil the election is held.
The gathering last evening was a suc
cess in every respect, for many visitors of
both sexes were present, although no ad
dresses or lectures had been prepared.
The three rooms, which are on the fifth
floor, were beautifully decorated with flags
and flowers.
Among the visitors were Mrs. Johnson
and Mrs. Bram. These ladies gave good
reports of the movement in the southern
part of the State and said that in their
section they expect there will be a
goodly majority in favor of the much-de
sired constitutional amendment.

The Cnm Ye Tong Society claim the

rumors which have been circulated about

Judge Slack yesterday declined to proceed
with the trial of the case of Angus et al.
against Craven. This suit is the one filed to
test the validity of the pencil deeds to the
Pine and Sansome and Guerrero streets prop
erty. A continuance of the case was asked
because oi the absence of Attorney Garret
McEnerney, who is on his wedding trip.
Judee Slack announced, however, that he
would not hear the case at all until the con
test of the pencil will is disposed of. The mat
ter therefore went over for two weeks.

TO THE SERVICE.
Death of the Wife of Rear-
Admiral Thomas 0.
Selfridge.
WAS AN OCTOGENARIAN.
Her Husband the Oldest Pear-
Admiral in the United
States Navy.
PASSED AWAY IN THIS CITY.
One of Her Sons Is a Rear-Admiral
and Two Sons Are Residing in
San Francisco.
Mrs. Thomas O. Selfridge Sr. died in this
City yesterday at the home of her son,
Edward Selfridge, at 2615 California street,
at the advanced age of 86 years. Her
maiden name was Louisa Carey Soley, and
she was the daughter of Squire John Soley
of Charlestown, Mass., thus coming from
an old New England family.
She came to California recently on a
visit to her two sons in this City, Frank C.
Selfridge and Edward A. Selfridge, the
last named being the president of the
George W. Gibbs Company of this City.
She was not ill long. The immediate
cause of death was old age. Dispatches
were sent East last night carrying the
news of her demise so other sons living in
the "East.
Mrs. Selfridge was the wife of the old*
est rear-admiral in the United States
navy. He was appointed a midshipman
from Massachusetts in 1818, and was re
tired in 1866 after over forty-five years of
continuous service. Two of her sons are
in the United States navy now. One of
these, Thomas O. Selfridge Jr., is also a
rear-admiral. Another son is Lieutenant-
Commander James R. Selfridge.
From this it will be seen that the
Selfridges have been prominently con
nected with the naval branch of the
United States service. Rear Admiral
Thomas O. Selfridge Sr., who survives his
wife, is 91 years old. For many years
Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Selfridge have re
sided at Washington, D. C, which is still
the home of Rear- Admiral Selfridge.

HOW THE WILSON BILL HURT AGRICULTURE.
The more carefully the tariff question
is studied in all its bearings the plainer
and more forcible is the conclusion that
one with strong protecti%'e characteristics
is of benefit to the country at large and to
tbe Pacific Coast in particular.
In a.nswer to the common cry that the
tariff benefits the rich manufacturing
classes alone it may be stated on good
authority that it benefits the agricul
turists more extensively than any one
class. When it is remembered that farm
ers constitute about half ot the business
population of the country the significance
ol this statement becomes clear. It was
Bryan, the apostle of free trade and
champion of the Wilson bill, who made
the statement in his Chicago convention
speech that the prosperity of the country
at large depends primarily on the welfare
of the farmers, yet his free-trade measures
work grave harm on the country at large
by striking the farmers a direct blow.
Speaking of one phase of the question
Joseph Nimmo Jr., the statistician, has
said:
"In the entire list of agricultural prod
ucts there are none more exposed to Cana
dian competition than poultry and eggs.
It is estimated that the total value of the
poultry produced annually in the State of
New York is about $2,100,000. and of eges
$5,200,000, the total poultry and egg prod
uct amounting in value to $7,300,000. New
York farmers from Buffalo to Montauk
Point, and especially farmers of Suffolk
County, through J. Eugene Parker of
Shelter Island, asked for protection on
these products, and it was granted in the
McKinley bill. Eggs, before free, were
made dutiable at the rate of 5 cents per
<iozen, the exact duty mentioned by Mr.
Parker, and the duties on poultry were
raised from 10 per centum (equal to about
1 cent a pound), to 3 cents a pound on live
and 5 ceuts a pound on dressed poultry.
That conferred upon the farmers of the
State a benefit than which none other is
more highly appreciated, especially on
Long Island. Now, I respectfully chal-
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION AND PROSPERITY.

Special Subject of Wide
Interest.
UNIFORMS FOR CONTINENTALS
Preparations Made by the League for
a Lady's Night Next Friday
Evening.
There is every indication that the big- j
gest meeting of the campaign thus far will |
be that to be held this evening at the j
Wigwam, corner of Jones and Eddy j
streets, under the auspices of the Republi
can State Central Committee.
Seats will be specially reserved for ladies
and their escorts, and they, as well as the
rest of the large audience, will be as com
fortably seated as the audiences in the
theaters of this City, because the Wigwam j
auditorium is furnished with elegant !
opera chairs.
The committee intrusted with the prep- I
arations for the meeting have been more
than successful in getting up a good pro
gramme. The speeches will not be long
and rambling and covering the same
ground, but each speaker has a special I
subject assigned him, and the speakers i
selected are the best on the Pacific Coast, i
At 8 o'clock sharp Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin of the State Central Committee
will introduce George A. Knight, the chair
man of the meeting.
Mr. Knight will deliver a brief address, j
after, which the glee club will sing
"America."
Judge R. B. Carpenter will speak on i
"That Crime of 1873 and 16 to 1."
Hon. John P. Jackson's topic will be
"Attitude of the Republican party toward
silver at the present time."
United States Senator George C. Perkins
will show that "the Democratic party is
not to be relied upon to ( restore pros
perity." ;
Hon. Samuel M. Shortridge will discuss
"the record of the Republican party, and
reasons why it can be trusted to carry out
its promises. "
Tirey. L. Ford will pay a tribute to
"William McKinley, soldier, statesman,
man and leader."
Rev. Anna Shaw will talk on politics,
and Chairman Knight will pronounce the
'â¢au revoir."
The speeches will be interspersed with
music by the glee club and by the Cali
fornia Quartet.

CONTINENTAL LEAGUE.
A Well- Attended and Enjoyable â¢
Meeting In Saratoga
Hall.
The Continental League held one of the !
most largely attended meetings in its his- !
tory last evening. Frank D. Worth was in |
the chair and Maurice L. Asher acted as
secretary.
Amos Currier, chairman of the execu- '
tive committee, reported that the com
mittee had about perfected the arrange
ments for the open meeting and ladies'
night to be held under the auspices of tjje
league next Friday evening at Saratoga j
Hall. The committee had succeded in se- j
curing Senator Georee C. Perkins, Congress- I
man Loud, Robert Tibbetts and H. C. Dib
ble as speakers. An entertaining musical
and literary programme had been arranged.
In addition to those interestine features
dancine would be begun at 10:30 o'clock.
George Lewis of the brigade committee
reported that two battalions of the league
hod been organized into a drill corps. He
asked what the league proposed to do \
about uniforming the battalions. The |
subject was deferred until a later stage of
the proceedings.
Secretary Asher reported twenty -two

lenge the editors of the Democratic news
papers of the State of New York to come
out squarely and tell our farmers whether
they, the editors referred to, are or are not
in favor of abolishing these protective
duties on poultry and eggs.
"There are several other important pro
tected products of agriculture in the State
of New York, amone them the pepper
mint industry of Wayne County, which
affords an extensive employment to men,
women, girls and boys. The total value
of the peppermint crop to the farmers is
about $160,000 annually. The duty on
peppermint oil was raised from 25 per
centâ about 37 cents a pound â to 80 cents
a pound in the McKiniey act. This
proved beneficial to both farmer and
j manufacturer. It is, however, imprac
j ticable in this connection to present state
ments similar to the foregoing in repard
to all the tariff-protected products of New
York agriculture. The facts already
J stated clearly indicate the manner and
the extent to which New York agricul
tural interests are affected by foreign com
petition ; aliso, the justice of adequate pro
tection to those interests.
"Tne Democratic policy places wool on
the free list for the reason that it is re
garded as a 'raw material.' Hay, beans,
potatoes, hops, tobacco-leaf, poultry and
eggs are also placed in the same category.
When this insulting and ruinous Demo
cratic policy shall have carved all the
I benefits of protection out of the agricul
; tural interests of the State of New York
j those interests will be not only 'raw,' but
bleeding."
If these are peculiar instances wherein
I the tariff has proved a benefit to New
â¢ York there are, also, samples of its bene
H. P. Goldstein of the committee on
campaign buttons received 348 buttons
from the factory. They are of brass,
gilded, and on each is embossed the three
figures constituting the vignette of the
league â the old Revolutionary tifer and
the two drummer boys, copied from the
celebrated oil painting. The buttons cosi
10 cents each for the first 500, and wnen
the question of price came to be consid
ered an animated debate ensued. Will E.
Fisher moved that the buttons be sold to
members at 15 cents each. Amos Currier i
moved that they be sold for 15 cents each
or two for 25 cents. Another member
moved that they be distributed without
any charge.
After a spirited discussion the price was
fixed at 15 cents each.
Under the bead of new business Frank
Roney moved that the membera of the
Municipal Reform League be invited to
address the league on the proposed new
charter.
M. Rosenthal suggested that as the Con
tinental League was a National body, and
not a local one, it would be highly im
proper for the league to dabble in munici
pal politics.
Chairman Worth said that on a former |
occasion the league had listened to an ad
dress from R. Freud on the same subject,
and it would be no more than justice to
allow the other side to speak.
Mr. Roney's motion was laid on the
table.
Will E. Fisher made -a little speech in
which he regretted that any one bhould
oppose the new charter.
George Lewis, on behalf of the brigade
committee, reported that the committee
had selected a uniform, and he wanted to
know how the unilorms were to be paid
for. The selection of the uniforms was
approved and the brigade committee was
given full power to act with regard to the
purchase of uniforms.
Professor Sichel played a piano solo very
acceptably, and tne Mohr brothers sang
several campaign quartets.
Captain W. H. Batchelder sang a comi
cal topical song which brought on an
encore.
Professor P. P. Ritter displayed a fine
voice in "I Love But Thee." For an en
core he sang ''In Old Madrid."
S. P. Salinsky recited "Dorkins' Night."
The meeting then adjourned.

IN THE WEST END.
Enthusiastic Meeting of the Thtrty-
Seventh Assembly District
Republicans.
The West End Republican Club of the
Thirty-seventh Assembly District met
last evening in their new hall at the cor
ner of Haight and Stanyan streets, with
B. I. Solomon, the president, in the chair.
The other newly elected officers, which
were all present, are as follows:
First vice-president, John R. Aitkens;
second vice-president, W. G. Long; secre
tary, John Bennett; treasurer, James
Cairnes; sergeant-at-arms, John Sparks.
President Solomon announced that he
had appointed C. O. Burton, M. M. Stern,
James Alva Watt, Lyman I. Mowry,
Charles D. McGown, A. B. Maynard and
E. A. Tuttle an executive committee.
By a unanimous vote of the club the
action of the Republican County Com
mittee in appointing Lyman 1. Mowry as
president and Joseph Goddard as secre
tary of the new central club recently
organized under the auspices of the com
mittee was indorsed.
Prominent speakers present were called
upon for short addresses and among those
who responded was Judge W. W. AHen.
The Judge began with a "few remarks"
and ended witn a rousing Republican
gpeeeh.
"I began to labor in the ranks of the
grand old party forty years ago," said he,
"ami I hope to work on in that illustrions
company for many, even forty years more.
T.iat party has made the greatest country
on the face of the earth. Its whole object
is to learn the wants of the people and
then meet those wants and the people
have prospered until the cold, chilly hand
of Democracy has been laid upon them.
Under the dominion of the Republican
parly our National credit was good and
our checks were cashed all over the globe.
But it is not so now.
"When Harrison turned over the ad
ministration to the Democrats we had
just concluded an appropriation of $33,
--000,000 for a World's Fair. Now we could
not give 33 cents for such an object. It is
hard to convince people who won't investi
gate. The Democratic leaders say, 'Vote
your party ticket; never mind facts and
figures. ! That is excellent advice ior their
followers when tacts and figures are con
demning. They want silver. Why, down
in the Mint there are millions of* it, and
yet you cannot get a dollar of that heap
till you have earned it.
"If it were freely given to you it would
have no value. To earn it the Repub
lican party provides a way by protecting
labor. It is easy to coin money, but if it
has nothing behind it it has no value.
Down on Townsend street there has been
for three years wool stored away. We
have no factories and the raw material
lies in the warehouse valueless. Wool
that we bought in Australia has been sent
back to that country and sold.
"The most foolish thing on earth is the
fi^ht against the aggregation of capital.
What could we do without capital?
Whence would come our factories, our
shipping, our railroads and every great
moneyed tning that has been a prime fac
tor in the development of the country?

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1896.
fits to the Pacific Coast. These have often
been dwelt upon by writers and speakers,
but they were recently made plain by
I Senator J. N. Doiph of Oregon, who said:
"The ceople of the Pacific Coast have an
object-lesson upon the tariff in the Chi
nese population. The characteristics of
the Chinese rnce are such that Chinese la
borers in the United States, no matter how
limited their numbers, necessarily come
into serious competition with white labor.
A Chinaman works for one-half the wages
required to support an American laborer.
He neither becomes a citizen identified
with business enterprises'nor to any con
siderable extent a consumer of American
products. He hoards his earnings to send
them abroad, while he supplants white la
bor, the wages of whicn would go to de
velop and enrich this country.
"Reasoning from the effect of the com
petition of a few Chinese laborers, who re
ceive for tbeir services probably ten times
the amount received at home for the same
labor, it is easy to understand the effect of
a policy which would cause many of our
industries to be transferred beyond the
sea, and would open our ports to the free
admission of the products of half-paid En
glish labor and the labor of India, China
and Japan.
"As a great section of the Union, the Pa
cific Coast shares in the general benefit of
a tariff which protects home industries,
stimulates enterprises, gives employment
to labor and promotes national prosperity.
Although, as manufacturing communities,
the Pacific Coast States do not as yet fa
vorably compare with many of the older
sections of the Union, their people have
for that reason probably a keener appre
ciation of the value of manufacturing in
again, for that is the issue of the cam
paign. I have had experience with fiat
money â Democratic money; have re
ceived it for my labor when a young man
in the Western Statesâ a dollar of it worth
50 cents to-morrow and 2o cents the day
after â and I want no more of it. I want
only the sound money of the Republican
party."
Upon motion of General Salomon asvs
tem of "missionary work" was adopted.
One man was detailed to canvass cacti
I block of the district for new club mem-
I bers. The idea was received enthusias
tically, and all present promised to labor
in the good cause. The club adjourned,
j with three cheers for the Republican nom
inees, to meet next Tuesday evening.
MR. LOUD SPOKE.
New Republican Wigwam on Pre
sidio Heights Warmed With
Eloquence.
Congressman Loud and Colonel John H.
Robinson addressed a political meeting
last night on tbe summit of Presidio
Heights in the new Republican wigwam
on M yrtle street near Washington.
Judge Dibble, who was present as an
auditor, was called upon to speak, but
apologized and promised to avail him
self of another opportunity should one be
offered, when he would be prepared to say
something thoughtful and calculated to
aid in rolling up what he predicted will
be the greatest Republican vote ever
polled in the district.
Chairman George R. Sanderson ap
pointed the following committee to ar
j range the dates of future meetings in the
I wigwam and to engage speakers: Oscar
Lewis, Wallace Bradford, O. D. Baldwin,
H. C. Firebaugh and B. Severus.
The fallacy of the free coinage of silver
furnished Mr. Loud with a theme, during
the discussion of which he contradicted
many Democratic campaign statements,
and went further back than tbe so-called
"crime of '73" to Bhow that the Populist-
Democratic party is not telling the whole
truth in regard to demonetization and
prices of staple products.
Colonel Robinson discussed tbe tariff,
the money question, the party candidates,
political history and statistics and struc k
a responsive chord when he remarked,
"Come and take our silver coated papsr
pills; all your pockets it will fill. If per
chance it should kiil, tbe Republicans wil
foot the bill, for they alone have the skill."
He also told a story of one man after
another buying a lot at an increasing and
fancy price, paying a little cash and giv
ing a mortgage for the rest. As the sale
progressed each man got his money back
by the cash paid on account, and each
time the price and the mortgage increased.
Finally tne last man was ''stuck." He
couldn't hud a purchaser. Then he com
plained that there wasn't enough money
in circulationâ more ought to be coined.
Some one asKed him why, and he replied,
"Why, to make more fools, of course."
Colored McKinley Clnb,
The Colored McKinley Club held a well
attended meeting in California Hall last
night, Chairman Sauiiders and Secretary
Butler being in their places. Speeches
were made by Rev. J. C. Pegram, Rev, J.
Callas and Rev. G. H. W. Smith.
Mr. Smith made a telling speech on the
evils brought about by the unwise re
vision of the tariff. In the course of his
remarks he said:
What a rosy picture we had painted for us
in 1892; what millions we were to expect. We
were to sell dearest and buy in the cheapest
markets. We took their worn for it and here
we are now. The least credible part of these
same gentlemen smearing tbe canvass with an
other picture for which they want us to pay
another four years or perhaps ten of this Na
tion's life.
Men deceived once are human; men deceived
twice by the same men are fools. lam bound
to say that the evil which has come to us by
mi unwise revision of tbe tariff has been greatly
aggravated by one of its consequences our loss
of revenue.
Whenever gold and silver have stood to
gether it has Deen at the market value. When
we tried to make gold and silver circulate to
gether we hfÂ»ve married them according to the
market value. To-day we find them not 16 to
1, but 30 to 1, and we are going, they say, to
lift sliver to twice its value â not by the univer
sal sense of mankind which alone makes
value, bnt by the statutes of the United States,
single-handed against the civiltz-jd world.
Italian -Americana.
At a meeting of the Italian- American
Republican Club, corner of Powell and
Union streets, last night a uniform corps
was formed. It will be known as the
Italian Cadet Club of the Forty-fourth As
sembly District. One hundred uniforms
were ordered. The club will give a picnic
at Harbor View Park, Presidio, as soon as
the uniforms are ready.
The following were the officers elected:
Joseph Merani, captain; Leo Ratto, first
lieutenant; Eugene Cadenasso, second
lieutenant; Joseph Demartini, third lien

A vote of thanks was tendered the

his generous assistance.
Mi-k. Coleman'g Estate.
The Inventory and appraisement of the

Mrs. Coleman left property valued at $302,

dustries, as is evidenced by their efforts
to secure manufacturing establishments.
They know that the removal of protection
from manufacturing industries always
makes their maintenance impossible, and
they look to a restoration of the principles
of protection as the one thing that will in
sure the future development of those vast
manufacturing industries which, on ac
count of their commercial and geograph
ical situation, and the abundance of
material and facilities for manufacturing,
they have every assurance to reauably
expect.
"The growth and prosperity of the com
merce of the Pacific Coast is dependent
largely upon the protection policy. It is
protection which builds up commerce be
tween the States: which directs trade into
domestic channels; which creates a variety
of industries within the Nation ; promotes
the rapid and constant interchange of
services between persons employed in
different industries and the exchange of
domestic products between the different
sections of the Union. The most wonder
ful and valuable commerce of the world is
that between 65.000,000 of people protected
by the American tariff system. The in
crease of our foreign imports would mean
not alone loss to our domestic industries
and of labor to our workingmen, but loss
to our internal and interstate commerce
as well.
"The people of the Pacific Coast under
stand what is meant by a tariff for revenue
only. The Mills bill, as an educational
document was a success. They have been
taught that a tariff forrevenue only would
put on the free list nearly everything they
produce, grain, vegetables, wool, fruit,
lumber, coal and lead, and that thu leaves

got the first postofiice established there, is
at the Palace.
Mr. Wood discovered the pay chute of
the renowned Iron Silver mine, and for a
number of years was the manager and a
large owner in that and other properties.
He had much to do with the development
of the wonderful ore deposits in the Rob
ert E. Lee mine, and was a pathfinder in
that great csmp in hitting on ways and
means of treating the ores.
Since Mr. Wood left Leadville he has
become heavily interested in silver and
gold mining elsewhere. He is also ex
tensively interested in copper mining.
For years he has been a large owner in the
Calumet and Hecla, adjudged for a long
time to be the greatest copper mine on the
globe.

them at a great disadvantage with the
world."
It is beginning to dawn on students of
recent tariff legislation more plainly each
day that tne predictions of Bryan were all
wrong as to the effects that would follow
the adoption of the Wilson bill. His
theories were all totally wrong, and his
reasoning vicious; for he beheld general
prosperity and everywhere foretold re
newed activity of factories and a general
revival of business. The most casual
study of the question disabuses the mind
of the idea that there has been tne faintest
semblance of prosperity under the Wilson
bill.
Take wool as a striking instance. No
one will pretend that the business did not
meet its death blow in free trade.
Another leading industry of the coast
} which the McKinley act protected was
| lumber, a most important enterprise. It
is said that there is invested in the lum
bering business of this country $300,000,
--000; that it cives employment to 1,000,000
people. In Washington, west of the Cas
oade Mountains, there are 20.000.000 acres
of timber lands, and there are also large
and valuable tracts, scarcely less in extent
and value, in Western Oregon. The red
wood lumber of California is a valuable
article of commerce. The Pueet Sound
mills have a capacity of over 900,000,000
feet of lumber annually, and the manu
facture of lumber upon the Sound in a
sinele year has reached 800,000,000 feet.
| The Democratic party proposes free trade
! in lumber.
Timber and labor are so much cheaper
in British Columbia, and the manufac
turers are enabled to obtain so much
cheaper machinery there, that when the
duty was removed from lumber the in-
I dustry was greatly crippled upon the
I Pacific Coast and elsewhere in the United
States.
The farmers of the country have not
been slow to note the evi^ effects of the
Wilson bill, nor are they unmindful of the
benefits they have felt as a result of pro
tection in the past.
It is not likely that so many deeply
affected classes will forget the benefits of
a thorough-going Republican policy or
ignore the injuries that have accrued to
them under a few years of what Mr. Bryan
called "a panacea for hard times."
The gentleman has been on a visit to the
IJ.acK Hills, Colorado, Arizona and Or
egon, in all of which be has been examin
ing mine-.
"1 have lone since quit managing
mines," said he, "as I do not care for the
responsibility. I think twenty years ex
perience in that way is enough. But if I
could tiiui a mine that I want I would buy
it. This has been the caus6 of my trip.
But I want to be careful what I get, for
while a good mine is the nicest thing a
man can own, a poor one is the very worst.
It is said that it costs $500,000 on the aver
age to make a good miner; that is, it takes
that much in tbe way of failures to make
him a good judge.
"As a rule I have found that good mines
declare their intentions very early in their
history. Relative to Leadville, while I
could not foresee the entire importance of
that place I J^new it was going to be a great
lead camp. I named the town and wrote
myself an application to Washington dur
ing Grant's administration in the seven
ties, asking for a postofhee and the ap
pointment of H. A. W. Tabor as post
master.
"The great coDper mines of Lake Supe
rior, from which I have come oy easy
stages, are in a prosperous condition.
There is 118 miles along the portage that
is devoted to mining.
"The Calumet and Hecla last year pro
duced about 42,000 tons of ore. TheQuincy,
which is next in importance to it, pro
duced from 800 to 1000 tons a month.
These are the two principal mines.
"We have gone through the period of
working unprofitable mines there, and
have settled down to the good ones. In
fact I don't think there is as much pros
pecting as there ought to be, for there is
yet a large amount ol country that has not
been properly tested.
"Lake copper is worth about 11 cents
now, the price still being high.
"The sapphire and ruby mines at Hel
ena, Mont., of which I for a time had the
management, are not being worked now.
We got out a lot of tbe stones, and then as
the market was well supplied it was con 9
eluded best to hold off awhile. It wwea c
right after the Baring failure, and ther r
was not as much of a demand as usual fo
je wels.
1 'The sapphires at Helena are what are
known as fancy sapphires. They are not
exactly the cornflower blue. The rubies
are pinks and reds, while, as in most
mines, few were of a really pigeon-blood
color. These mines are, as you know,
iargely Owned by English capitalists.
"As to silver, which is now an issue in
the campaign, with the proposition to
coin it without restriction, I muse say I
think it would be a bad thing for the
country. In place of its helping business
and making times prosperous it would, in
my judgment, cause very hard times.
"I am in favor of gold and of the finan
cial policy adopted by the Republicans in
their National platform, because it is the
only course that is destined to bring pros
perity here
"If we com all the silver that comes to our
mints you will simply see the value of the
silver dollar reduced to its bullion value.
That is the ultimate end. Nothing can
prevent it
"At the same time the gold will dis
appear. If you have gold and silver in
your pocket and have a bill to pay you
wont pay the bill with gold. You will
hold on to that. But you will pay the
bill with the silver. The jrolcl will dis
appear from the country as it has in Mex
ico. They have, indeed, had both kinds of
money there, but you can go from one
end of the country now to the other and
you won't see any gold.
"I confidently hope for the election of
Mr. McKinley, for that will bring Rood
times, while the election of Mr. Bryan
would undoubtedly make times infinitely
worse. As to Michigan, my own State, I
will say I do not consider there is any
doubt about that going Republican. It is
a certain Republican State.
"The nomination of Mayor Pingree of
Detroit for Governor has materially added
to the strength of the Republican cause.
Mayor Pingree has hitherto interested
himself a great deal in the cause of the
people and they believe in him. He fought
the gas company and the streetcar com
pany and beat tnem, and he also, as will
be remembered, planted the vacant lots in
the city in potatoes to aid the poor. He
will poll a heavy majority.
"The Lake Superior basin last year pro
duced over 9,000,000 tons of 6per cent stan
dard iron. A great deal of salt, lumber
and similar interests are at stake there.
Michigan is r tariff State.
"Now, in Colorado if you oppose free sil
ver they hoot you, but that isn't argument.
As a man whose life has been devoted to
the study of tbe precious metals I must
say I can see only far worse times by
throwing open our mints to the white
metal."

for Her Female
Relatives.
RUNS AWAY FROM HOME.
Prefers Her Mother to Her
Grandmother, but Doesn't
Like Either.
HER PARENTS ARE DIVORCED.
A Fourteen-Year-Old Girl Who Has
Studied the Law Regarding
Her Position.
A little girl has been found who don't
like her grandmother. She don't like
her mother either, but sne confided to
Judge Slack yesterday that she bad a
hundred times rather live with her mother
than with her grandmother. She is a
bright-faced pretty little miss, and she
lioesn't seem to be such a very, very bad
girl, but she told unblushingly how she
ran away from home ever so many times.
The little girl's name is Grace Baker,
and her father and mother have not lived
together for almost ever since she can
remember. Her mother, Mrs. Susan Baker,
who is a school-teacher, got a divorce away
back in 1887, and was by the court given
the custody of Gracie. Grade has a mind
of her own, and for some time has been
deeply thinking about the action of the
severe old Judge, who said her mother
might have charge of her.
Papa Baker has been in the habit of
coming to see his little daughter once or
twice a month for a long time, and during
these occasional interviews she formed
quite a liking for her father. He took her
to Oakland with him and the two wan
dered about together in Blairis Park and
almost forgot to come home, so happy
were they in each other's company. When
they finally did get back Mrs. Baker met
them at the door and gave them both a
raking over for staying out so late.
The happy hours Miss Grace spent with
her father caused her to long for his com
ing and made her restless at home. Her
mother was unable to control her effectu
ally and they had bitter quarrels, and
then Gracie would run away. She was
sent to live with her grandmother, but
she ran away from there, too. It was in
describing her levanting from her crand
r>arent3 that she used the remark quoted
in the first pan^'raph of this story. She
said when >he left there she went to her
Aunt Lucinda, "who," she naively added,
"doesn't like grandmother very well,
either."
Tne result of all the runnings away was
that Gracie finally ran to her father. She
one day, so she testified, was in a library
looking over some volumes when she
found a musty old law book. She glanred
through it and saw a passage, "ail in lit-

guardian. She thought she saw a way
out of all her troubles and so consulted
her father about it. Then shyrent to a
lawyer. But alas, she found tffat the Jaw
didn't apply to her case.
Yesterday the Bakers were in Judge |
Slack's court, represented by a number of j
attorneys, fightiner for the possession of 1
the child. Mrs. Baker, with tears in her 1
eyes, declared that she has only her off
spring to live foÂ» Gracie stoutly main
tains that she will not reside with her
mother and that she wants to spend her
days with her father, who ha 3 placed her
in a young ladies's school on Pacific
avenue, where she is beine taught French
and Latin and other polite accomplish- |
ments.
Mrs. JJaker, however, says that her ex- j
husband is not a proper person to have
charge of an innocent child. Bhe claims 1
that he is a "bad man" in the truest sense
of the word; that he was unfaithful to her
during their married life; that he is un
truthful, unreliable and dishonest. She
cites an instance in which she declares
that Baker stabbed a man at Los Angeles,
and also says that he has on several oc- |
casions appropriated property belonging j
to other people, all the while being osten- |
sibly a pillar of the church to which he |
belonged.
There was not time to finish the argu
ment yesterday, so the matter went over
until to-day.
Gracie is a very intelligent, lovable, lit
tle girl, and no matter to whom the court
may see fit to award her, one thing is cer
tain she will lead any one wno tries to
keep her from her father a dog's life.
Uefaulting Messenger- Boy.
henry Chester, a messenger in the employ-
raent of the American District Company, was
booked at the City Prison yesterday on the
charge of misdemeanor embezzlement. On
August 15 he got $46 from L. Heath of the
Liverpool, London and Globe Insurance Com
pany to deliver, but he tailed to do so, and
went to Santa Rosa, where he was arrested.
HUGH O'NEIL CONVICTED
Will Ec Sentenced for Bringing Tuber
culous Meat Into Thig County
for Sale.
Hugh O'Neil, the San Mateo County
butcher, who for several years carried on
the business of slaughtering decrepit
horses in this City and sending tnem to
Chinatown lor sale, was convicted by act
ing Police Judge Kerrigan yesterday of
sending into this county tuberculous
beef.
Thomas Mahoney and Patrick Harring
ton, who were driving tne wagon contain
ing the beef when captured by Market In
spector Ben Davis and a squad of police,
testified thai O'Neil had instructed them
to convey the meat to a butcher-shop in
Chinatown. They were corroborated by
other witnesses. O'Neil claimed that he
had given the beef to the young men to
carry to the fertilizing works, but as he
could bring no evidence to support his
statement his story failed to impress the
court, particularly as Inspector Davis tes
tified that attempts had been made to re
move the tubercules from the ribs of tha
carcass by scraping them.
Judge Kerrigan found O'Neil guilty un
der the section of the law that prohibits
the transporting into the County, selling
or exposing for sale diseased meat, and
ordered him to appear for sentence to-day,
intimating tnat in bis judgment the of
fense merited a severe penalty.
MISS KATHRYH KIDDED,
The Star of the Mme. Sans Gene
Company Expected To-
Day.
Impersonator of the French Laundress
Who Fascinates Napoleon Bona
parte in the Play.
] Miss Kathryn Kidder, who assumes the
i role of Catherine Hubscher, the washer-
I woman of the Rue St. Roch in Sardou's
Mme. Sans Gene, will arrive in this City,
overland, this evening. She will make
her first appearance in this character at
the Baldwin Theater Monday evening,
August 31. Miss Kidder is a lady of
marked personality who has made an en
viable place for herself in the dramatic
profession. Sardou, when she was abroad,
sent for her to visit him in his study.
Sardou said to her that he "had made
Mme. Sans Gene a vulgar woman and as
such she must be played."
Some light is thrown upon Miss Kid
der's characteristics by her response to the
great playwright. "Pardon me, sir," she
said, with emphasis, "you do not know
American audiences as well as I do. I
shall p!ay her as an ignorant woman, but
not a vulgar woman."
It is related of Miss Kidder that she has
fads. One of these is a fondness for lace
handkerchiefs, of which she has made a
very large collection. She has gathered
them from all parts of the country, North,
South, East and West, and sbe never fails
to purchase one in every city she visits as
a memorial. She is noted for her love of
pretty things, and perhaps her handker
chief collection illustrates this.
Another trait is illustrated by her ac
count of her personal impressions concern
ing Sardou. She has sent an account of
this to a friend in this City. She was in
Sardou's studio only a comparatively
short time, but she took in her surround
ines with the fidelity of a camera.
"It is not the studio," she writes, "that
one would have expected to find in the
home of a writer, but had more the ap
pearance of an artist's sanctum. There
were very few draperies, but the walls
were hung with etchings and exquisite
pictures of every description, while the
furnishings of the room were of the rich
est character, and everything, even to the
writing-desk at which the playwright was
seated, was arranged with the exacting
neatness that betrayed the hand of a care
ful woman."
During the interval preceding the first
production here of "Mme. Sans Gene"
Miss Kidder will devote some time to see
ing the sights of the City.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1896.
GREAT CARNIVAL
OF ELOQUENCE,
Foraker and Teller to Speak
at the Sacramento
Fair.
atTESTIONS OF THE DAY.
They Will Be Discussed by
Orators of the East and of
California.
RESTRICTIONS TO BE IMPOSED.
Neither Parties Nor Candidates for
Office to Be Mentioned by the
Plans have been prepared and are under
consideration which, if carried out, will
give to the people of the State of California
one of the greatest intellectual festivals it
has ever been the privilege of any State in
the Union to enjoy.
Sacramento will be the scene of the ora
torical innovation, and it will be under the
auspices of the State Board of Agriculture,
and will be provided during the continu
ance of the annual fair of the board during
the latter part of September.
Not only will the best talent of the ros
trum of California be called upon to par
ticipate in the carnival of eloquence but
such speakers as Senators Foraker and
Teller are to be invited to address the peo
ple of California on the great and burning
politico-economic questions that are at
present agitating the public mind of the
United States.
But a few days ago John Boggs, a promi
nent member of the State Board of Agri
culture, approached W. H. Mills, who has
a remarkable fund of new ideas always on
tap, and asked him if he could not sug
gest something that would lend a new at
traction to the annual fair of the board to
be held at Sacramento â something that
would break up the monotony of the exhi
bition and display's.
Mr. Mills suggested as a very appropri
ate thing the discussion in public of the
question of markets for the products
of the agriculturists. â¢ This naturally
brought up the question of the tariff, ow
ing to the important bearing that matter
has upon markets for American products,
and this in turn brought up the various
issues of the approaching efection. The
problem was to divest these discussions of
any partisan character.
The further the matter was discussed be
tween the two gentlemen the more impor
tance and fascination it assumed. In
view of the purity-of-e!ection law, it was
argued, it was impossible for any of the
parties to spend any considerable money
in the way of educating the people, and
this would be a cheap way of doing so.
As the result of tins interview Director
Boggs requested Mr. Mills to write out his
ideas, so that they would be clearly out
lined. Mr. Mills did so and they were
promptly placed before the board. They
met with favor, and Mr. Mills was then
asked to formulate a complete programme
embracing his full plan of education. This
he has done and the result of his labors is
now in the hands of the board, who will
act finally upon the matter to-day at Sac
ramento. Mr. Mills' communication,
which it is expected the Board of Agricul
ture will adopt as a whole, embraces not
only the proposed programme, but the
purposes of the project. It is as follows:
The State Board of Agriculture, believing
the future welfare of the people of the State
of California to be Inseparable from the estab
lishment of sound political and economic doc
trines, recognizes the presence oi State and
National problems, the solution of which
challenges the earnest, thoughtful and con
servative attention of our people. It has there
fore decided to promote the non-partisan con
sideration of the political and economic
questions of the day, and to tnat end has
determined to invite the proponents of vari
ous political and economic theories to diseuÂ«s
these theories before the assembled multi
tudes of our citizens at Sacramento during the
coming annual exhibition of the board.
In the execution of this purpose the board is
prompted solely by a desire to promote the
education of the people, to direct public
thought into reasoning and conservative
channela, and to inspire patriotic devotion to
the highest good of the country, and especially
to the future welfare of the people of the State
of California. To the end that the considera
tion of the questions to be discussed FhaU not
degenerate into partisan disputation, it is
hereby resolved that the following rules be
and are hereby adopted for the direction and
government of the disoussiqns.
1. The discussion of public questions before
the board shall not at any time take the form
oi' a debate.
2. The discussion of any subject by any
speaker shall be limited to the effect of the
policy advocated upon the people of the State
of Ca ifoinia.
3. The following shall constitute the ques
tions which shall be discussed, one address to
be delivered on each day, except as otherwise
nrovided :
How would the policy of high protection af
fect the welfare of the people of California ?
How would the policy of a tariff for revenue
only affect the welfare of the people of Cali
fornia ?
How would the policy of a modified tariff
supplemented by an income tax for the pur
pose of raising Federal revenue affect the wel
fare of the people of California ?
How will the free coinage of legal tender
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 without the con
currence of other nations affect the welfare of
the people of California?
How will the free and unlimited coinage of
legal-tender silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 by
international agreement affect the welfare of
the people of California ?
How will the permanent establishment of
the single gold standard affect the welfare of
the people of the State 0/ California ?
How will the construction of the Nicaragua
canal promote the welfare of the people of the
State of California?
How may California secure a re-enforcement
of her capital and population ?
fNote.â The two last-mentioned subjects will
be discussed on the same date.]
How will the proposed amendment to the
State constitution abolishing the tax on mort
gages affect the welfare of the people of Cali
fornia?
How will the defeat of the proposed amend
ment abolishing the tax on mortgages and the
maintenance of the constitution in its present
form affect the welfare of the people of Cali
fornia?
How will the proposed amendment to the
constitution of California relating to woman
suffrage affect the people of California?
How will the defeat df the proposed amend
ment and the maintenance of the provisions
of the constitution of this State, limiting the
exercise of suffrage to male citizens only,
affect the interests of the people of California?
[Note.â The amendments to the constitution
being Btate issues, the discussion of each has
been assigned to a single day.]
What adjustment of the debt owed by the
Pacific railroads to the Government of the
United States would best promote the welfare
of the people of California?
[Note.â Two addresses to be delivered in
answer to the last-named question.]
4. The addresses shall be delivered in the
State Agricultural Pavilion at Sacramento,
commencing at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, and
the admission shall be the same as ordinary
admission to the pavilionâ 2s cents.
5. During the delivery of the addresses the
exhibits shall be deemed to be closed to
visitors, and the audience will not be per
mitted to disturb the addresses by walking
through the pavilion; but it is expected that
auditors will be seated.
6. The audience will be permitted to mani
fest approval by decorous applause, but in no
case will any manifestation of disapproval be
countenanced.
7. No political banner or device relating to
the political campaign will be permitted to be
carried or displayed r>y any member of the au
dience.
8. The names of, candidates before the pco
pie for electionCfo efflce shall not be men
tioned, and cheers or demonstrations of favor
itism will not be permitted.
Auditors are earnestly solicited to heartily
second the effort of the State Board of Asrricul
ture to have the discussion of these important
questions before them as a jury of American
citizens, conducted with Don-partisan de
corum.
The Doard will confer with political commit
tees upon the question of the personality of
those wno will address the people upon these
political and economic topics, but it reserves
to itself the right of final selection.
The board will appoint a presiding officer
for the proposed meetings, who will be vested
with authority to call any speaker to order
who transgresses ibe rules hereby established
and enforce upon the audience a courteous
and decorous attention.
As a rule, there is nothing of interest
going on during the mornings at the
State Fair, and it is for this reason that
the morning hours, 10 and 12,
have been selected. The pavilion is to be
arranged so that it will be possible to seat
5000 people within easy range of the
speaker's voice.
Arrangements have already been made
which will insure the presence of Senator
Henry M. Teller at the fair. He will speak
on behalf of the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1. He is expected to ar
rive in San Francisco next month.
Efforts are being made by the Republi
can State Central Committee to bring Sen
ator Foraker to the coast, and should
these negotiations prove successful he will
be asked to speak at Sacramento on the*
subject of tariff protection.
General W. H. L. Barnes will also be
asked to speak to a subject that is an
issue with the Republican party, and its
selection will probably be left to him.
M. M. Estee is mentioned in connection
with silver from a Republican stand
point.
Senator Stephen M. White will explain
the beauties, as be sees them, of a tariff
for revenue.
Captain William L. Merry will be given
the opportunity of talking to the masses
of the benefits that will accrue to the
people of the State when the Nicaragua
Canal is a fait accompli.
General N. P. Chipman, president of the
State Board of Trade, will tell what in his
opinion is the best way to attract immi
gration to California.
John P. Irish, the enthusiastic gold
Democrat in season and out, will be in
vited to expound the benefits of a single
gold standard to the people of California.
Witty and eloquent Anna Shaw, if the
wishes of -the local Woman's Suffrage
Association are heeded, will dilate upon
the effect of the defeat of the woman's
suffrage amendment on the people of
California.
No speakers have yet been mentioned in
connection with the other subjects on the
programme, but they will be selected with
particular reference to their knowledge of
the subject allotted to them and their
ability to speak in public. It is the pur
pose to make this course of education in
political economy not only satisfyingly
informative but thoroughly enjoyable.
GOT MANY SPECIMENS,
Return of University Men
From a Tour in Lower
California.
An Ex-Convict Crushed to Death
Under a Keg of Butter on
the Queen.
Among the arrivals yesterday were the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Queen, from Alaska, and the Orizaba from
Mexico. Among the passengers on the
former was J. A. Fillmore of the Southern
Pacific. At Sitka the Queen took on about
twenty miners who were tired of prospect
ing for gold. Their story does not vary
from that of the hundreds who have
reached home before them. An ex-con
vict named Patton lost his life alongside
the steamer at Sitka. He and a compan
ion were attempting to steal a keg of
butter from the vessel. It slipped when
the tnief was passing it over the side, and
and taking Patton along, both butter and
man went throuah the bottom of the boat
that was alongside, and disappeared.
Patton never came up again.
Among the passengers on the Orizaba
were: D. Coolidge of Stanford University,
L. H. Miller of the University of Califor
nia and J. J. Abbott, also of Stanford.
They have been in Lower California for
three months, and during that time nave
cellected 1300 specimens of birds, 700 of
animals, a large assortment of reptiles and
insects and over 1300 eggs. They bring a
larse assortment of bats, a large colony of
which Coolidjje discovered by tumbling
into the hole. They say the only deadly
animal they encountered down south was
the skunk. Anything that the filthy beast
bites gets hydrophobia and dies. One of
the guides employed by the party was
bitten by one of the animals and died two
days Jater.
The Maie Island and Vallejo steamer
Monticello has not been running this week.
I Some necessary repairs to her machinery
had to be made, so she was laid up.
Although the Sunol has practically had
the route to herself in consequence the
fare of 10 cents to Vallejo has not been
increased, so the traveling public has no
cause of complaint.
The bark Theobald will return to Coal
Bay, Alaska^ next week with miners,
miners' supplies and machinery. The
sample coal cargo she brought down has
turned out so weli that work on the mine
will be pushed and a regular line of colliers
put on.
The German bark H. Hackfeld, now at
Honolulu, has been chartered to load
wheat here for Europe at Â£1 71 6d Jess
1 shilling and 3 pence direct. The bark is
expected here in a couple of weeks.
Andrew Jacobson, a sailor on the
steamer Mackinaw, had a narrow escape
yesterday. Had it not been for James
Black, one of the Merchants' Exchange
reporters, the chances are that he would
have lost his life. Captain Littlefield
always sends a boat ashore for his wife
when he is off Meiggs wharf, and yester
day Jacobson was detailed for the job.
The backwash of the steamer capsized his
boat and ho got tangled in the towing
line. Black went to his assistance or tie
would surely have been drowned. This
makes half a dozen lives that the daring
boatman has saved during the last year.
LINCOLN POST SOCIAL.
Profes.ior W. W. Stone Gives His Old
Comrades an X-Kay
Lecture.
Principal W. W. Stone of South San
Francisco Primary School lectured on the
X-ray in N. S. G. W. Hall last evening. It
was the occasion of the regular social of
Lincoln Post, G. A. A., of which Professor
Stone is a member, and he was invited to
talk electricity to the comrades.
The lecturer stating in the outset that
the way to build a house was to begin at
the base, commenced with the "wave
theory" and explaining the forward move
ment that was sound, the vibratory that
was light, and the spiral that was elec
tricity. He spoke of the beautiful solar
spectrum, then the far-reaching ray. With a
number of chemicals and several electrical
appliances, Professor Stone illustrated his
entertaining lecture. After the scientific
repast, refreshments were served and the
rest of the evening was passed socially.

GEORGE STOLEN
ACCUSED OF CRIME
Indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury on a Seri
ous Charge.
SENT OBSCENE LETTERS
Ex-Inspector Williams and Louie
Quong Again Under In
vestigation.
WILL PROBABLY BE INDICTED
Attorney P. B. Glidden Arrested for
Sending Improper Matter Through
the Mails.
It is probable that the United States
Grand Jury will on Tuesday next return
an indictment against Dick Williams and
Louis Quong on a charge of subornation
of perjury.
The Grand Jury yesterday considered a
portion of the evidence in the new case,
and in Federal circles it is whispered tnat
there is no question as to the final out
come. The principal witness examined
was Dong Sing Yit, a demure Chinese
maiden who claims to have seen but 17
summers.
It seems that Dong Sing was brought
into tbis country illegally, though through
whose connivance is not definitely shown.
In any event, it appears that Williams
and Quong were brought into the case,
and it is now claimed prevented Dong
Sing from testifying to the truth. Com
missioner Heacock was before the jury
and gave evidence of a most important
character, and Assistant Attorney Schles
singe'r will appear before the jury next
Tuesday and give testimony corroborating
all that has gone before. When this is
done it is generally believed that an in
dictment on the charges above named will
be returned.
An indictment to be placed on the se
cret file was returned against George Stier
len, the well-known architect and builder,
and bond fixed at $2500. The charge is send
ing obscene letters to Mrs. Alfred Is?on,
now deceased, and who, it may be re
marked, was the wife of his brother-in
law. The damaging letters were in the
po3sessionol Jud#e Sanderson, who turned
them over to the Grand Jury at the urgent
request of that body.
Isson is a jeweler doing business at 11C
Pacific street. Three years ago he lived
in Mexico, and it is claimed that while
Mrs. Issou was on a visit to this City she
became enamored of Stierleu. The hus
band heard of this and requested the im
mediate return home of his wife. The
woman started on the ill-fated Colima and
lost her life in the wreck. Subsequently
Isson found certain letters written to his
wife by the accused man. He opened them
and found that they were of an extremely
obscene nature.
Tne husband, angry beyond measure,
returned to the City and instituted suit
j against Stierlen for alienating his wife's
; affections. The letters were never allowed
1 to go to tne jury, and pending an appeal
lof Isson's cause, Judge Sanderson re
tained them in his possession. Isson ap
plied to the Federal authorities for re
dress, but nothing could be done in the
matter at that time, because Judge Mor
row had held there no was crime in send
ing obscene letters, provided they were
sealed. Since then Judge Ross has held
otherwise and been sustained by the Su
preme Court. With these facts well be
fore the jury it was only a matter of a few
moments to return the indictment above
referred to.
Prescott B. Glidden, the young attorney
who was indicted by the Grand Jury last
Tuesday on a charge of sending obscene
matter through the mails, was arrested
yesterday. Glidden is accused of making
life generally miserable for Miss Jennie
Ryan, the pretty stenographer of Attor
ney Firebaugh. Some months ago the
youns> lady secured a temporary revenue
by publicly horsewhipping the attorney.
The affair created considerable excitement
at the time, but was finally hushed up.
For a time Glidden ceased his attentions
to Miss Ryan, but a few weeks ago he com
menced again, this time resorting to the
mails, with ihe result that he is now in
dicted on a most serious charge.
A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT.
Excellent Qualities of the Late
James Dwyer, School
Principal.
Resolutions Adopted by the Teachers
of the Horace Mann
School.
At a meeting of the teachers of the
Horace Mann Evening School, held last
evening, the following resolutions were
adopted :
Whereas, The mystic summons of death has
suddenly called from us and from his sphere
of active usefulness our honored and esteemed
associate and director, James Dwyer; and
whereas, it seems but fitting that we, so re
cently his collaborators, should express in
some public way our recognition of the loss
sustained by the teaoning, profession to which
he had devoted so much of his active life, and
particularly by this school, with whi ch he has
been identified since its organization, in the
untimely closing of a career tuat had given
promise of years of devoted and efficient work
in the full maturity of power, therefore, be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the academic
staff of the Horace Mann Evening School that
in the loss of its principal the school has lost
the services of one whose high sense of duty
impelled every effort of a mind ripened and
broadened by Dative talent ana extended ex
perience to its advancement and success; that
every member of the school Has lost a wise di
rector and prudent counselor, thoroughly im
bued with a personality that made itself felt
in the most casual Intercourse witn the
humblest pupil, yet balanced by an irapersou
ality that could always look above and beyond
the individual, to the moral and intellectual
elevation of the %vhole; that every teacher hns
lost a warm-hearted personal friend, whose
rare and admirable qualities won the respect
and esteem of his professional associates, as
his unassuming character and genial frank
ness commanded their affectionate regard.
Besolved, That while we may not intrude on
the sacred privacy of the family circle where a
vacancy has been left that can never be filled ;
while no words of ours can avail to assuage the
pangs of irreparable loss, we still ieel that we
may ask the family of our departed associate,
director and friend to accept this tender of our
heartfelt sympathy in their deep affliction,
and this expression, though imperiect, of our
sense of the bereavement that they have sus
tained by the sudden call that haa taken troin
them ' the husband and father whom they
mourn. C. H. Crowell.

MARKET AND TAYLOR STS.
THE YELLOWSTONE PARK,
Many Eastern Tourists, but
Few Californians Go
There.
High Praise for Government Man
agement of the Park
Affairs.
James Gibb has just returned from an
interesting trip through the Yellowstone
Park. Speaking of the visit yesterday he
said: "It is surprising how few Califor
nians and how many Eastern tourists
visit this wonderful reservation. I was
told that some two hundred tourists arrive
daily from the East. The Californians in
the park when I was there were Mr. Sachs,
two young lady schoolteachers, myself,
wife and daughter. Six of us from this
State were assigned to one coach and we
made the journey together, stopping at
each hotel in the chain.
"It was my observation," said Mr. Gibb,
"that the management of the park, under
the immediate direction of the United
States Government, was almost perfect.
The hotels, in point of modern equipment
and service rendered to guests, are first
class, and each is supplied with its own
electric plant. The horses p.re fine, the
Concord coaches are new, and all the at
tendants seem to understand that their
duty is to look out for the comfort and
convenience of passengers.
"I was particularly impressed with the
intelligence and courtesy displayed by the
officers and enlisted men of the United
States army who are on duty in the Yel
lowstone i'ark. I was informed that the
finest soUiiers in the service are detailed
for this special duty. Surely one could
not expect more kindness and civility
than they bestowed. The enlisted men
private soldiers â seemed to be quite as
well informed as the officers.
"In ordinary sight-seeing one can doth*
park in five and a half days. The excur
sion tickets make this allotment of time,
allowing travelers to remain one night at
each one of the five hotels in the chain.
Our party extended the tour to seven days
and a half, which gave us an extra day at
Mammoth Springs arid an extra day at the
grand canyon of the Yellowstone.
"In reserving this vast area of moun
tain forest and natural wonders for the
whole people the Government did a wise
thing, and in my judgment Government
supervision is an excellent feature. When
it comes to sublime scenery and wonder
ful worts of nature I know that no land in
the world surpasses tbe Sierras in Califor
nia, but somehow we have not acquired
the art of getting the people of the world
to visit tbe sights in this State."
THE FUNE GROWING.
Over Twelve Hundred Dollars Sub
scribed for the Charter Campaign.
The first contribution to the Charter As
sociation funds have been made. The
Merchants' Association has generously
contributed $1000 and James D. Phelan,
president of the Charter Association, has
contributed $250 to the funds necessary to
carrying on the campaign in favor of the
adoption of the new charter. A number
of banks, insurance companies, capitalists
and property-owners have already signi
fied their intentions of making suitable
appropriations to this fund. There is
every indication that sufficient money
will be contributed for all the necessary
expenses of the Citizens' Charter Associa
tion. Every public-spirited citizen in the
community who desires to make a contri
bution will kindly send the same to the
chairman of the finance committee, Colonel
M. H. Hecht, or to the officers of the
Charter Association.
The Divorce Court.
Judge Slack yesterday granted Marie D.
Wood a divorce from \V. Roy Wood because of
the latter's failure to provide and willful de
aertion and neglect. The custody of the minor
child was awarded to plaintiff.

THE FIELD
OF SPORT
Sporting circles are at present in a very
lively state of anticipation owing to the
various events planned for the near future,
the occurrence ol which will mean so
much to those most vitally interested.
In the pugilistic arena there are going to
be two great contests, one between Choyn
ski and McAuliffe, the other between Van
Buskirfe and Stelzner.
The attention of owners and breeders of
dogs is drawn to the grand bench show of
the San Jonquin Valley Agricultural As
sociation, which will begin September 23.
Riilemen are elated over the opening of
si x new targets by the San Jose Turners,
and hunters and fishermen are sending in
reports of their success from all over the
State.
Among wheelmen great interest is ex
hibited in the race between Terrill and
Johnson.
The election of big Pete Smith as cap
tain of the Olympic football team marks
an era in the history of the club.
In all other lines of sport events of in
terest are scheduled.
THE WHEELMEN.
Great Interest Being Taken In the
Race Between Terrill and Jones.
More interest is being taken in the
race meet to be held this afternoon at the
Central Park track, Eiehth and Market
streets, than in any other meet held here
for a long time past. Tnis can be ac
counted for by two reasons, first because
the meet is being handled directly by the
clubs and the Cycle Board of Trade, and
second because tnere is a good programme
of events and a special match race be
tween two of the fastest and most popular
professional riders on the coast to-day.
The open events will consist of one- third
of a mile scratch, one mile handicap, ama
teur, and one mile handicap, professional.
There is a large entry-list for these races,
and the names of the starters, their heats
and handicaps have already appeared in
The Cai>l.
But it is the match race which will create
the most enthusiasm. Opinion seems to be
about equally divided as to the relative
merits of the two riders except around the
clubs to which they belong. Btroll into
the Bay City Wheelmen's clubhouse on
Golden Gate avenue and listen to the talk
there and you would think the race was
over and * Terrill had the purse in his
pocket Drop into the big building on
Post street and chat with the Olympic
Club Wheelmen and you would wonder
why Terrill ever made a match with a
man so much his superior in riding ability
as Jones. Of course, this partisanship is
more than pardonable, for without club
feeling the cycling clubs would lack life
and activity. And it is just such differ
ences of opinion that make match races,
as this one was arranged.
The members of the two clubs in ques
tion have indulged in a great deal of quiet
betting on the side, and even from this
one cannot get an inkling as to which
rider's chances are looked upon as the
best. There are as many backers of one
man as of the other, and no odds are
given or taken. To be sure, the Olympics
did want the Bay Citys to give them 2 to
1 or 8 to 5, and assured Ten-ill's supporters
that he was the better man, but this was
just a little friendly "jolly" to get the
best of the odds, and the Bay Citys soon
saw through the game. They had been
trying to make a similar play in other
quarters themselves.
The race is to be at one mile, best two in
three heats, for a purse of $300, which has
been put 'pp in the hands cf W. B. Faw
cett, who is conducting the meet for the
clubs and the Board of Trade. In order
that the meet may be conducted without
loss, no complimentary tickets have been
issued. The individual club members
have bought reserved seats liberally, and
Irom the advance sales a large crowd is
assured. ,
T. G. Spillane, acting captain of the
Olympic Club Wheelmen, has arranged
the second annual watermelon run of his
club for to-night and to-morrow to Stock
ton. The members will take the steamer
Mary Gar/att, leaving Washington-street
wharf at 6 o'clock to-night. Arriving in
Stockton in the morning, they will be
taken in hand by the wheeling annex of
the Stockton Athletic Club, and a ride to
Lodi for lunch will be in order, after which
the attack on the watermelons will begin.
The return will be made by boat Sunday
night.
The four-mile handicap road race of the
Santa Rosa Wheelmen last Sunday was
won by F. Mead from the thirty-second
mark, with Henry and Ben Noonan
(scratch) tie for second place. There were
twelve entrants. In the two-mile scratch
road race the Noonan brothers again fin
ished in a dead heat for first, George
Felix being second. Last Thursday even
ing about foity of the members formed a
theater party under Lieutenant Poat and
attended the Athenaeum. Friday evening
they had a watermelon social at the club
house, followed by vocal and instrumental
music To-morrow there will be a run to
the" redwoods beyond Guerneville and
Sunday week some more road races.
The members of the Pacific Cycling Club
made an enjoyable trip last Saturday and
Sunday. They took the steamer Zinfandei
at 7 o'clock for Cuttings Landing, in Napa
County, which was reached at 10:30 p.m.
After an hour's ride they reached the
Monte Vista ranch, where they stopped
over night as the guests of Judge and
Mrs. Milton Withers. Sunday morning
they continued to Napa City, and a visit
was made to the insane asylum. In the
afternoon they wheeled to Sonoma, tak
ing the train from there to Tiburon,
thence by boat to this City, arriving
home at 6:30 p. it. To-morrow's run will
be to San Jose, riding down on the other
side of the bay.
The Drobable price of bicycles for next
year is a subject much discussed these
days. Many so-called high-class wheels
marketed last spring and listed at $100
have been selling for almost any price. It
is generally known in the trade that these
wheels, in a majority of cases, are far from
being as good as they are cracked up to
be, and, this being the case, it should re
sult in profit to the old-established houses
â which have made a reputation with really
meritorious machines. The most con
servative men in tne trade base their cal
culations in estimating the probable price
next year on the business credited to the
older and most successful houses. The
mushroom concerns and the companies I
which turn out wheels simply for a quick
profit, so to speak, are sharp, ragged rocks
m the channel of successful trade and are
given a wide berth by careful pilots.
They have a bearing on next year's trade
in the sense of indicating the general
price for fine wheels. A consensus of
opinion from observing students in the
bicycle industry tends to show that $75
will be the erica next year for bicycles
which have Heretofore sold for $100.
The degree of hardness to which tires
should be inflated is largely a matter of
personal preference. They should never
be left soft enough to flatten out much be
yond the edges of the rim when support
ing the weight of the rider.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen of Oak
land will have a theater party at the Mac
donough next Monday evening, Chauncey
Olcott being the attraction.
Edwin E. Stoddard of t the Bay City
Wheelmen will leave this morning by
steamer for Central America on business.
From there he will go to South America,
and will be absent about half a year.
Cycling is often recommended as a
means of making stout people thinner,
but it should not be forgotten that it will
also add flesh to those whose bones are
unpleasantly prominent. The explana
tion is simple. Good sound muscle is put
where formerly only unhealthy fat ex
isted, or perhaps nothing at all.
Harry Wheeler, Charles M. Murphy and
Earl H. Kiser, the three Americans who
went to Europe to race this spring and
met with considerable success, will return
s hortly and make their way to Australia,
via San Francisco. We have already seen
Murphy and Kiser ride here, and know
they "are top-notchers. Wheeler is' the
man whose reputation was made in a day
by defeating the mighty Zimmerman.
He has,, never repeated the trick, but has
been a remarkably consistent performer,
a nd has won a jrreat many big purses as a
professional in Europe and this country.
The annual meeting of the members of
the Bay City Wheelmen will be held Tues
day evening, August 1. Reports of officers
will be received and a nominating com
mittee elected to select a board of directors
for the ensuing term. It is expected that,
with a couple of exceptions, the present
board will be re-elected. Their work has
been well done, and as a result of their
management the club was never in a more
I healthy condition. The membership roll
is 'constantly increasing, extensive im
provements have been made at the club
house, and altogether the Bay City Wheel
men are a well-satisfied lot of cyclers.
R. M. Welch, representative of the Na
tional racing board, has issued his usual
weekly bulletin, and it is cf more than
ordinary interest. It will bring joy to
some riders whose suspensions have been

are withdrawn not later than one week before
the date of a meeting they are obligated to ride,
and in the absence of a good and sufficient ex
cuse for keeping such engagements they be
come liable to suspension. Entry at another
meeting will not be acceDted as an excuse. A
rider must not enter for the same day at more
meetings than he can atteud. The referee of a
meeting may excuse a rider from starting in
any event.
The racing board has decided that amateurs
shall not be allowed to accept compensation
for services or expenses in connection with
the projected transcontinental relay from San
Francisco to New York. R. M. Welch,
Member National Racing Board.
It will be noticed that all the riders who
competed at the meet held at Santa
Monica last Sunday, and all the officials
who acted at that meet, have been sus
pended for one year. This punishment is
well merited. These men knew the league
does not sanction Sunday racing, and yet
they went to work and arranged a Sunday
meet, charged an admission and gave
prizes, under the name of the Wheelmen's
Training League. It would not have been
a breach of the rules if they had not
charged admission nor given prizes, but as
it was they flew directly in the face of the
racing board, and Chairman Welch's
prompt and severe punishment by a year's
suspension is the result.
Eastern cycle publications are unani
mous in their opinions that Bald and
Cooper should be suspended indefinitely
for their foul riding at Louisville last
week, and tae United Press reports of
yesterday say that Chairman Gideon of
the National racing board is investigating
the matter and will probably rule them
off for a year or more. This would deprive
the circuit of its two brightest stars, but
with such fair riders as the Butlers,
Ziegler, Gardiner, Sanger, Coulter, Mc-
Farland, Wells and others left they would
hardly be missed, and certainly not
mourned.
If any one thinks the Olympic Cyclers
are not going to have a jolly time to-mor
row their doubts should be set at rest after
a perusal of the following notice to mem
bers:
OLYMPIC CYCLERS.
San Francisco, Aug. 18, 1896.
The club will hold a run to Escalle's, Marin
County, on Sunday, August 23, 1896, leaving
the club at 8:30 a. m., taking the 9 o'clock
boat. On this occasion a jinks will be given,
which is expected to be a treat. It is the in
tention to make this an annual event, and the
fact of the cyclers inaugurating it is a suf
ficient guarantee of a hoopla-merry-go-round
time. As a result of our recent minstrel enter
tainment our treasury is in a large, fat and
plethoric condition, Treasurer Blake's pockets
bulging to such an extent that the organiza
tion has magnanimously agreed to lift the
strain by expending the remarkable sum of
$125 on lunching and entertaining our mem
bers. At great expense a siring orchestra will
be on the ground?, with such Tootlight favor
ites as Hallett & Cathcart, Bob Mitchell; Fer
ris Hart man (who will sing Pearl Andrews'
latest success, "Reel, Reel, Reel O'Reel"), Ben
Tarbox. Willie Fiunie, little Jimmie Swinner
ton, Alex Rotiborough, Williams <fe Orndorff
(knockabout team), C. F. Morel, Billy Hynes,
Billy O'Brien, Fred Bushnell, CharlieKreling,
and last but not least our dear brother and
organist, Jack Couney, will be with us.
Sports on land and water will be held,
trophies being given for flrstÃ and seconds in
each event, which will be as follows:
One-mile handicap bicycle race; 100-yard
dash ; sack race ; three-legged race ; partnership
race ; leap-frog race, teams of ten men : cigarette
race; fat men's race, 200 pounds and over; 50
--yard swimming race; 50-yard swimming race
(breast stroke); tug-of-war in boats; one-mile
boatrace.
This will be essentially a picnic run, and no
member should be deterred from attending
through fear of a long journey. The ride will
be short and pleasant, about five miles from
San Rafael. The cluh has gone to considerable
trouble and expense, and each member should
contribute to the success of the run by attend
ing. Fred R. Butz, Captain.
George WÂ° Coon'ey J Li eutenanU.
Thomas B. McGinnis, Secretary.
Th*> Acme Club Wheelmen of Oakland
and the Alameda Cyclers of Alameda will
have a joint run to Haywards to-night,
and there indulge in a feast upon water
melons. As the roads are good, the dis
tance short, and there will be a full moon,
the ride snould be delightful.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen packed
the California with themselves and their
friends last Tuesday evening, the occasion
being the club's theater benefit. About a
dozen small theater parties were made
up by different members, one by Frank
W. Fuller, another by Lewis C. Hunter,
the largest being that of President and
Mrs. Charles Albert Adams, whose euestg
were Mr. and Mrs. McFarland, Mr. and
Mrs. Zeille, Miss Daisy Wnitelaw, Miss

H. W. Spalding.
Emil Languetin of the Bay City Wheel
men is training hard for his attempt upen
the world'? five-mile road record Bunday
week, and many think he has as good as
got the record, barring accidents.
It is not generally known that the Bay
City Wheelmen have a member who once
defeated Chftrapion Zimmerman in a mile
race. He is Fred Chandler, who has been
absent in Australia for the past two
months and is expected home in a few
days. The race occurred at a town in
Ohio some three years ago, when Zimmer
man was at his very best. It was a mile
handicap, and Chandler's first and only
race. The official handicapper gave him
an immense handicap, some say it was
500 yards, but at any rate be was so far in
the lead Zimmerman did not notice him.
After "Ziinmy" had overtaken his field in
his usual clever style he saw Chandler a
short way ahead, pegging away for dear
life. Thinking it was some fellow he had
lready passed once he did not try to
catch him, though he afterward said he
wondered why the boy was working so
hard when he was a lap bo bind. But it
was Chandler.whose big handicap won him
the race and a victory over the world's
champion. It was the race of his life and
be has never cared to ride anotner, being
content to rest on his laurels. Incident
ally, Mr. Chandler is one of the most
popular members of the Bay City Wheel
men and of the cycle trade in this City.
The latest membership list of the League
of American Wheelmen shows a roll of
62,464 names. Twenty-four new names
went in from this division last week.
The Golden Gate Cycling Club will have
another sunrise run to the beach to-mor

Monday to help their captain, W. J. Black,
over his twelve miies of hills in tne trans
continental relay race. Spalding.
PUGILISTIC ITEMS.
Van Buskirk and Steizner Are
Intaglioed on Attention's
Wall.
Puerilism at present reigns supreme, all
other sports paling into insignificance in
comparison as the mellow beam of the
morning star is shadowed by the ap
proach of jocund day. San Francisco is
one of the liveliest sporting cities in the
country at all times, and at present is in
the heyday of her splendor.
The lively competition of the National
and New Occidental clubs has much to do
with this; in fact there was no real rivalry
until the energetic "Young Mitchell" en
tered the field. Bince that time Managers
Gibbs and Groom have hustled around
pretty briskly. Their efforts have con
vinced the admirers of both the clubs that
as defuncts they are a flat failure.
It was pretty generally conceded in
sporting circles when Jeffries was stricken
with pneumonia that the National Club
was in hard luck. This turns out to have
been the same kind of prophecy as that
inaugurated by the priests of Baal. Not
only was a man found to supply Jeffries'
place, but one on whom considerable in
terest is centered just now from the fact
that, although little or really nothing is
known of his exploits here, he turns out to
have been a sparring partner of Bob Fitz
simmons for about ten months. This in
itself is ample demonstration that he
THEO. VAN BUSKIRK.
ought to understand several of the finer
points of pugilism.
When Steizner took to training and
sparred with Choynski at the Olympic
Club the few favored sight-seers at once
went out and hunted for a chance to put
up some of their cash against Van Bus
kirk money.
Van Buskiric's record is, of course, well
known, as he has met only a few men, but
has been uniformly successful heretofore.
Of Steizner it may be said that he has met
many good men, mostly very heavy fight
ers, though none have been men of Na
tional repute, and has succeeded in send
ing them into the land of Nod in short
order.
Among those he has met may be men
tioned the following:
April 17, 1893, defeated Ed Jones at St.
Louis in three rounds; August 25, 1893,
fought a draw with Willis Kennedy of
New Orleans; October 29, 1893, knocked
Billy Butts, weight 220 pounds, out at St.
Louis in one round ; November 14, 1893,
defeated Tom Fitzpatrick before the
Mound City Club at St. Louis in two
rounds; March 9, 1893, stopped Jones,
the champion middle-weight of Arkansas,
at Hot Springs in four rounds ; April 22,
1894, bested F. M. Kahn of Boston at the
Olympic Theater in St. Louis in three
rounds; July 13, 1894, knocked out Billy
Zashritz, weight 218 pounds, in six rounds;
December 19, 1894, defeated Billy Dooley,
weight 170 pounds, before the Pastime
Club at Memphis, Term., in twenty-two
rounds; February 3, 1895, defeated A. E.
Allen of Wisconsin at Hot Springs in
thirteen rounds; April 1, 1895, knocked P.
J. Nolan out at St. Louis in two rounds;
July 6, 1895, bested Mike Queenan, the
"Stockyards Giant" of Chicago, weight
228 pounds, in four rounds ; July 25, 1895,
defeated Jim Johnson, the colored heavy
weight of Texas, at Tyler in five rounds;
July 26, 1895, put Jim Fogarty to sleep at
Tyler, Tex., in six rounds; was with Fitz
for ten rounds and re-entered the ring
June 23, 1896, to best Jim SulHvan, weight
210 pounds, at Park City, Utah, in four
teen rounds.
From the number of heavy-weights
Steizner has met and the quick time in
which ne has defeated them, together
with the cleverness he exhibits in boxing
Cboynski, it is evident that those who at
tend his battle with Van Buskirk next
Tuesday evening at the Grove-street
Theater will, in all probability, see a
rattling good contest.
Joe Choynski and Joe McAuliffe are
both busily at work getting into first-class
shape for their contest before the Occi
dental Club at Woodward's Pavilion the
evening of the 28th inst. Like Corbett,
Choynski likes nothing better than to
have a squad of Olympic Club members
congregate and watch him punch the bag,
twirl the wrist machines, exercise on the
bars, plunge in the tanks, and box with
Green, Steizner and Peppers. The "chrys
anthemum" is in first-class condition
and his flesh has a ruddy color, but he
seems a trifle low in weight. But he
never takes on flesh even when out of
training.
McAuliffe has relaxed work a slight bit
out at Barney Farley's, as he is now at a
good weight, 225 pounds. Joe's efforts up
JACK STELZNER.
til] the day of the fight will be for strength
and cleverness.
Henry Peppers is in Oakland putting on
the finishing touches for his bout with
Purceil. Peppers has the reputation of
being one of that class of ringsters denom
inated as "foxy," and will make the New
York rusher know that he is in front of a
small cyclone himself.
Gus Herget is in Alameda rapidly set
ting into form for his "go" with '"Spider"
Kelly. This ought to turn out one of the
cleverest contests witnessed here in a long
time.
The last and most authentic reports are
that-Gallagher has no intention whatever
of avoiding his scheduled meeting witn

before the event.
The National Club's offer of $20,000 for
the Sharkey-Corbett contest is not likely
to be duplicated by another organization,
so far as can be learned. That is a large
sum to offer for a boxing contest in these
uncertain times, and a great deal of pluck
was requited to offer it.
A rnmor is afloat to the effect that an
attempt will be made to pull this fight off
at West Baden Springs, but its authen
ticity is very doubtful, as the State author
ities have made several bitter fights
against ring contests there with the event
ual result of a triumph. Since then the
laws have been made so strict as regards
prizefighting that any chance of a meeting
seems utterly beyond the bounds of pos
sibility.
If Corbett and Sharkey are really
anxious to fight, and the latter' s eagerness
is unquestioned, it would be a very easy
matter to evade the peace officers. This
has been proved time and again. The
case of Maher and Fitzsimmons might be
mentioned in this connection, as well as
that of Sullivan and Kilrain. who fought
witn bare Knuckles at Richburg, Miss.,
July 8, 1889, giving the authorities of two
States the slip.
It has been given out that Jimmy An
thony, the bantam-weight champion of
Australia, is willing to tneet Frank Smith
of the Olympic Club and Dan Mahoney
the same evening for eight rounds each,
providing he be permitted a half hour be
tween the contests in which to rest. Smith
agrees to this if Anthony will sign articles
to defeat him in the eight rounds. As
Smith fights in the feather-weight class
nis offer is magnanimity personified.
Anthony, next to Joe McAuliffe, is the
apple* of old Barney Farley's eye.
The Crescent Athletic Club of Berkeley
has decided to postpone the date of its
boxing tournament until Augnst 29, in
order to give the committee on arrange
ments more time in which to make
matches. Two are already settled.
This month will also see a contest be
tween Cleveland Johnny La vac k and Aus
tralian Billy Murphy, who will box fifteen
rounds, with rive more optional.
The New York News, bearing date of
August 14, is authority for the statement
that "Young" Griffo, who was sentenced
to one year's penal servitude by Judge
Aspinwall of the Brooklyn County Court
for maltreating a boy while the fighter
was intoxicated, stands a fair chance of
being freed shortly.
Lawyers generally are of the opinion
that GrirTo's sentence was illegal, as the
County Court was not in session, being
adjourned by law until October, and con
sequently that Griffo was practically tried
out of court. Friends are now endeavor
ing to have him released on a writ of
habeas corpus.

Shooting and Fishing Parties Daily
Come and Co.
Now is the time when the disciple of
Izaak Walton is in the height of bis glory.
From all over the State comes the news of
good catches made by parties early in the
field, while others are shakina the metro
politan dust from their feet every day and
departing for the various streams cele
brated for the fish they contain and as the
scenes of the most remarkable exploits of
local fly-casters.
Good catches of trout are reported from
tee lower Truckee. In fact, this seems to
be the favorite fishing ground. They are
mostly taken with the spoon, as the moss
in the river interferes somewhat with fly
fishing. The coming week, however, will
be fine fishing on the Truckee.
A pleasure-seeking company, composed
of fl. E. Skinner, A. G. Wieland, John F.
Siebe, Baldwin Wood and Colonel Green
leaf, will leave for the Truckee fishing
grounds late this evening. Mr. Skinner
will be accompanied on tne excursion b y
his wife, who thinks she stands as good a
chance as the gentlemen of the party in
hooking the speckled beauties.
Many parties have recently be9n to San
Andreas Lake in search of salmon-trout,
with which these waters abound. Many
good catches are reported of late, as the
coolness of the weather has been condu
cive to the trout taking the bait. Several
have been lucky enough to secure a few
black bass, but these catches are compara
tively few.
Dr. James F. Stanton and M. J. Geary
are still engaged in wooing the finny tribe
from its haunts among the pools and
bowlders of the Truckee River. If the
length of time of their excursion can be
considered as proper evidence they must
be in need of stronger fish baskets now.
The San Francisco Fly-casting Club will
have their semi-monthly tournament, in
which a competition will be had for med
als, at Stow Lake this afternoon at 2
o'clock.
A. L. Langerson and Al Cummings went
for a pleasure trip on the Truckee River
last Thursday. So far, their friends have
received no fabulous tales and it is
shrewdly suspected that they are waiting
to make a reputation on their return.
The season for the mountain quails and
giouse opened the 15th inst. Good shoot
ing is reported in Mendocino, Lake and
Humboldt counties and in the vicinity of
Boca. The birds are not so well grown as
is usual at this season.
Last Sunday Joseph Cresta and about
five companions killed two magnificent
bucks in the region of Fairfax. Just back
of that city thtre is a vast canyon known
as Fairfax Gulch, which the party reports
as teeming with deer of all sizes.
Mr. Harvey of the Pope Manufacturing
Company, in company with two of his
friends, had a very pleasant hunting ex
cursion in the region of the San Pedro
Canyon last Sunday. Three deer were
run from cover, and they succeeded in
crippling one of them, but the wounded
animal in its flight got onto the property
of the Spring Valley Water Company,
where none of the hunters dared trespass.
The following characteristic letter from
the sporting editor of the Call speaks
very loudly for itself:
Boca, Aug. 17.
Among the heavy â¢ weight anglers and
grouse hunters who are now rusticating at
Boca, the great ice center of the Sierra, are:
Thomas Casey, "the humorous politician of
the water front"; Dr. James Stanton, who is
taking incidentally observations of the South
ern Pacific bridges and steel tracks; John
Bourdette, a famous authority on Blackstone
and soapstone ; Sam Newman, whose reputation
for ease in solitary nooks is without question ;
W. F. Bogart, the picturesque angler, who dis
dains to use anything but "a fly" to catch fish ;
A. R. Crowell, a man who never gets excited
when grouse shooting; Alex Ireland, an artis
tic angler, who has the utmost confidence in
the Watt spoon for catching minnows; "John
Bugg" Walker, a lover of nature and good eat
ing; Mr. Cooper, the champion spoon caster
and several other disciples of the rod ana gun
who are having good sport in the high alti
tudes.
Casey caught a well-conditioned log on Mon
day last while casting for rainbows and sun
fish in the Truckee River; Dr. Btanton caught
a cold; Sam Newman caught a beautiful ap
petite; Bourdette 'caught on" to-day, but he
has not yet succeeded In landing his game-
Crowell caught a good ducking through a slip
on a smooth rock; Bogart expects to catch a
train this evening. In fact it seems to be a
case of catcn-as-catch-can with the disciples of
Walton who are at present rusticating in the
mountains. Fishing on the Truckee is not
good now, as the water is still too high and
tons of moss are floating down the river
Grouse-shooting Is good. The birds are plenti
ful. bÂ«t very small this ysar. A thunder
storm is daily expected. M. J. Geary.
The results of last Sunday's shoots of
the Lincoln Club at Alameda Point were

consecutive bluerocks. The medal whl
become the property of the contestant
winning the same twice.
The ifincinal Gun Club will hold their
practice shoot at Bird's point to-morrow
at 10 a. M. This club has only been in ex
istence about three months, but has in
that time given many excellent shoots,
and a fine programme has been planned,
for to-morrow.
The Olympic Gun Club will give an in
vitation shoot and outing at the San
Bruno grounds Augnst 23. No event 3
have been scheduled, but the price of birds
will be f2 a dozen straight. The party
will leave on the 8:15 train from Third
and Townsend streets.
Empire Gun Club will hold its final
shoot for classification August 23, the race
being a 30-Dird one. Three late acquisi
tions to the club have been in tne persons
of L. T. Hauxhurst, H. J. Weise and E.
Morgan.
The Empire Gun Club will hold a chal
lenge team shoot of twelve men with the
Garden City Cyclers, Gun Club.September

Late yesterday evening F. M. Haight of
the firm of Clabroueh & Golcher arrived
from a pleasant trip in the mountains of
Humboldt County. The party consisted
of Haight and wife and G. E. Bacon and
wife.
They left for Eureka on the Ist
insr., and from there went to Orick on
Redwood Creek. The first day they
caught seventy-nine fish, ranging from six
to fourteen inches in length. During their
outing five deer were killed, but they
were not prepared to brine any of them
home. On one occasion^ajdeer approached

who admits that despite his Rocky Moun
tain training he overshot the deer "twice.
A great deal of merriment was afforded
the ladies by Bacon, who had never slept
out of doors in his life, and exhibited great
alarm at the proximity of a bat or bug.
One night Haight shot at a tame cat,
thinking it to be a skunk, and at the re
port, Bacon kicked a hole in the canvas
tent. On learning what had happened, it
may be stated on the authority of Haight,
the reaction on Bacon's nervous system
was so great that he nearly fainted. Later
on he emphatically insisted .-' that before
any more nocturnal shooting was done he
be awakened.
During the trip many wild pigeons and
several grouse were bagged.

RIFLE AND RANGE.
San Jose Turners Will Open Six
New Targets.
The third annual prize shooting festival
of the San Jose Turn Verein Shooting Sec
tion will be held on the 30th and 31st inst.
This marks an important event in the
history of the Verein, the opening of its
new park near the Garden. City. The new
park is one of the finest on the coast, and
the shooting-range has been fitted with all
the modern appliances. Tnere are six
targets in all.
The rules governing the opening event
are, that all shooting shall be off-hand at
200 yards, and all rifles shall be allowed,
excepting those using the steel-covered
bullets.
On the first day tbe shooting will begin
at 10:30 a. m. and close at 6 p. m., with an
intermission at noon for lunch. On the
second day the shooting will begin at 9
A. M. and close at 5 p. m.
On the point targets the black will be
divided into three points â tickets eight
shots for $1. The best centers will be i
measured after the shoot.
There will be fifteen prizes for the best
centers, consisting of three cash prizes to
the amount of $50 and twelve elegant
prizes valued at $175. For the most points
there will be fifteen prizes â three of cash !
to the amount of $50 and twelve merchan- |
disc trophies worth $200. A silver enam- J
eled medal will be given to all marksmen j
Ehooting over 50 points, $2 50 for 100 points, !
$2 50 for 200 points and $5 for 250 points.
The San Jose Mercury has offered a
beautiful gold medal which will be pre
sented to the maricsman who scores the I
most points in both days' shooting.
Seventy-five prizes, valued at $750, con- j
Bisting of silverware, jewelry, etc., will be j
presented to those who make the best |
scores on the honorary targets. Cash
prizes of $2 50 and $1 will be given for the
first and last bullseyes in the forenoon and
afternoon.
Sunday morning the Turners will be at
the depot to meet the guests from San
Francisco and the other large cities of the
State. The Sau Francisco Turners will
attend the festival in full uniform. Rep
resentatives of nearly every rifle club in |
the northern part of "the State will partici- j
pate. The guests will be escorted from ;
the depot through the principal streets of j
Pan Jose by the Turners and the Turner
t-chuetzen in uniform, and afterward all
will repair tothe park.
Round- trip tickets from this City to
San Jose, including admittance to the
parK, can be obtained for $1 85 at the busi
ness places of all the well-known local
marksmen. Monday night the Turners j
and their guests will bold a grand ball and j
distribution of prizes.
The officers and directors of the Turners
are: Captain, Fred Schumacher; first
lieutenant) L. Henning; second lieuten- ]
ant, L. Ziegeler; treasurer, F. PosKy. K. \
Klein and George Keffel have both served
as captains.
The second day's shoot of the Califor
nia Schuetzen Club's annual festival will
be held to-morrow at Schuetzen Park, i
near San Rafael. All twenty targets will
be in use during the entire day, and it is
believed that there will be many good rec
ords made. The shooting will be on the
man ana German 25-ring targets. The j
events will be shooting for the honors of
shooting king, for the highest honors, and j
special cash prizes, ranging from $8 to fl. j
The highest score on the king target will j
entitle the marksman to tne king's crown j
and a diamond medal.
The shootinc on the honorary and man
targets will also be resumed. Forty casn
prizes are offered for the best scores on
the man target. These range from $30 to
$1. Several very good tickets were shot at
the honorary target last Sunday, but bet
ter scores will be made at to-morrow's
shoot. On this event seventy-five mer
chandise prizes will be given away. A
champion silver goblet will be presented
by A. L. Ott to the marksman making the
best average on all the targets. In addi
tion to the foregoing, the members of the
club will shoot for prizes.
The prizes will be distributed on Thurs
day evening, August 27, at Eintracht Hall,
Twelfth and Folsom streets, and the dis
tribution will be followed by a social.
The attendance at the Shell Mound
range to-morrow will be large, as there are
several clubs and a number of military
companies there holding their monthly
medal contests. Among them will be the
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club, the Nord
deutschers and the San Francisco Schuet
zen Club. The Columbia Club has decided
to move from tbe east end of the shooting
ehed to the extreme west end, and Captain
tnebe will put in the marking-wheels at
once. The reason for this is that the pis
tol and rifle ranges may be together. A
aoor will be cut through the wall so as to
connect the two shooting stands. A little
later a partition will be run through the
big room so as to shut off tbe draught.
Wardrobes, closets and rifle racks will also
be constructed.
It was feared for a time that the two
west targets, A and B, would be too badly
exposed to the wind for fine shooting, but
the members decided to change and make
more use of their wind-gauges.
A ladies' auxiliary to the Columbia
Pistol and Riflle Club is about to be
formed. The wives and daughters of a
number of the member? are already very
expert in handling the 22-caliber rifle and
pistol. A number nave entered the lists
for prizes and have proved themselves to
be fairly accurate shots. From all ac
counts the ladies will form a club the early
part of next month and make use of the
third target on the fifty-yard range.

FOOTBALL.
Preparations for the New Season
. in Active Progress.
After the big Thanksgiving game it is
very probable that the Olympic football
team will have a game with the Mult
nomahs of Portland and the Butte, Mont.,
team. . . ' â¢ ' ' ' _ â ' "
As there will probably be no Reliance
eleven this year the Olympics intend to
pet in the best possible form to meet these,
t<5 The'chances are that the Peerless Foot
ball Club of the Mission 'Till make an
active display this year. They have an
athletic club of their own and the players
are working hard to bring themselves into
proper form to take their place near the
head for the season. v . . ,
Several of the Siamord graduates in and
about the City wife are interested in foot
ball are expected to play with the Olympics
1 The ca oiympic Club football men have
The Olympic Clnb football men have
elected as captain of I this season s team
Pete Smith, the big guard who captained
the eleven last â¢ year. â  Smith â is nearly 6
feet 2 inches in height and weigha : in his >
football clothes over 200 pounds. He has
played witb the Olympics for the last
three seasons, first as center and then as
guard. During tbe season of ' 93, while a
freshman at trie University of California,
he played guard on the Varsity, but in the
Thanksgiving game of that year he filled
left tackle's position, relieving Loren
Hunt, who was early retired from the field
because of au additional injury to a lame
leg. Before that one year at Berkeley
Smith had played football for some time
at Cogswell College, in this City.
Trained in '93 by the giant Heffelfinger
of Yolo, said to be the greatest guard that
ever lived, Smith has since developed his
play along the lines suggested by his
teacher, whose physical proportions he
approaches more nearly than any other
football-player in California.
With respect to veteran players from
which to reconstruct an eleven, the Olym
pics are better off than either of the uni
versities. Stanford has lost six of her old
team by graduation and Berkeley has lost
one by graduation and five through other
causes. The Olympics have Kingdon, 192
pounds, center; Middlemas, 178 pounds,
guard; Smith, 195 pounds, guard; Sexton,
176 pounds, tackle; Porter, 192 pounds,
tackle; Nahl, 140 pouuds, quarter, and
Percy Morse, 160 pounds, halfback.
They have lost both ends, a halfback
and a fullback. But for new men they
practically have Weldon, sub-fullback for
Stanford last year and a, player of four or
five years' experience at Belmont School
and at Stanford University, and Tommy
Code, quarterback: of the Stanford Varsity
for four seasons. Both men have been
members of the Olympic Club for several
years, Code having at one time been a
well-known lightweight wrestler. In ad
dition to these men, Captain Smith has
his eye on Harrelson, Stanford's star
quarterback; Lewis, formerly an end rush
on the Stanford Varsity ; Downing, cap
tain of the Stanford Varsity in 1894;
Frankenheimer, Stanford's veteran ena
rush and halfback, and Wilson, for sev
eral years end rush of the Berkeley Var
sity. These men have been graduates
from college, and are now in business in
or near this City.
Of the veteran Olym Die players, Sexton
first played with the Olympics in 1892 and
then in 1593. Kingdon, known as a
promising young wrestler in his ciub,
made his initial appearance on tbe grid
iron field last season. And here it may be
appropriate to say that Captain Smith
laughs at the suggestion that Kingdon
may, as a student in the college of phar
macy, play with Berkeley this year. He
declares that Kingdon will stay with the
Olympics exclusively, as he did last year.
Middlemas has played but one season,
though he had experience previous to last
year while a student in Anderson's acad
emy, Alameda. Percy Morse is a veteran
football-player in tne broadest sense of
the term. He has played both the asso- I.
ciation and the intercollegiate game off !
and on for the last five years. "Porter," J
as they soy at the Olympic Club, "has i
been playing football since the year 1." I
He played at Amherst College years ago;
then, in 1892, helped coach Stanford while
he was a teacher and a coach at a San
M a teo preparatory school, where he played
the game for several years.
Then he played with the Olympics, and
in '94 played on the Berkeley Varsity,
having qualified for the team by entering
the medical college of this City. Last year
he returned to the Olympics.
The Olympics will not begin training
before the middle of September, a time
when the two universities will also set tbe
ball rolling. The individual players and
the club have enough suits to tit out a team
at very small expense.
Pringle, last year's manager of the
Reliance Club eleven, has not been re
elected to that position, which is still
vacant. Fred Frict, captain of the team j
last year, is now deep in Oakland politics.
Tue club itself is making no active
preparations for a team this season, though
one may yet be organized, much of tne
old material beiiig available.
It is said that big Bert Oliver, guard and
tackle on the Reliance eleven for the last i
two seasons, will enter Stanford this year.
He aas been a college possibility for sev
eral years. Now it eeems he has decided
to go at the request of Manager Brown of
the Paio Alto team, who is also an Oak
land boy and an old schoolmate of Oliver.
Brown soon after his election to the man- |
agership, set about with Captain Fickert :
of the Stanford team to engage a coach j
for mis season. Walter Camp could not
return, but he had done everything pos
sible while he was out here to lay the
foundation for a good team this fall. One
of Manager Brown's first thoughts was to
engage Butterworth, thereby not only de
priving Berkeley of his services but secur
ing for the Stanford players the advantage
of his intimate knowledge of the Berkeley
men he had trained last seaso'-.
But the idea was soon abandoned as
savoring of a tricky advantage. After
considerable correspondence Cross, Yale's
center of last season, was engaged to come !
to Palo Alto on October 1 ana coach j
Camp's old pupils for two months. Cross j
is not a star player, neither is Captain j
Fickert of the Stanford team. But both
are big, determined, conscientious men,
wiio tfive backbone to a team by adding
strength and firmness to the line. Cross !
played on the Varsity only in his senior
year at Yale. Previous to that he had
been on the second eleven â a most excel
lent place to observe and learn the whole
game. The one place for whic.i he was
peculiarly fitted happened to be filled by
the great Stillman, a phenomenal center,
who as such was a little better man for the
place than Cross. But Palo Alto's new
couch is fresh from the gridiron field; he
has Camp's trained men to work with,
and he will himself be thoroughly in
touch with the Stanford captain in mak
ing the line, already composed of veterans,
a stone wall for Berkeley to oppose with

How/ the Rowers Train for the
Big Regatta.
Interest in the great Stockton regatta on i
Admission day is rapidly increasing;, and j
each evening the wharves in the vicinity j
of Long Bridge, tbe present training quar
ters of all the local clubs, are crowded
with enthusiastic admirers of the speedy
oarsmen, criticizing their work during
their practice spins.
The scene along the old bridge during
the training hours of the respective clubs,
which are from 6 to 8 p. m., is an animated
one, and one can feast bit optic organs on
some remarkably fine rowing.
The course at these hours is always
crowded with all manner and description
of racing craft, and some wily single
sculler with an ambition to be a future
Peterson can he seen trying the mettle of
some crack skiff rower, or else trying con
clusions with Â«ome crack four-oared crew
as they po skimming down the course,
each man rowing with a clocklike move
ment, and the little cockswain ever and
anon bobbing up and down in the stern of
the boat like a veritable automaton.
Very often some exciting racing is in
dulged in, much to the amusement of the
spectators, and, all in all, a trip down to
tiong Bridge in the evening while the oars
men are in training for the f.ventful day
of September 9 would prove interesting to
any one interested in the sport of rowing.
The methods of training now in vogue
by the different clubs are almost identical.
They consist of a three-mile spin each
evening from the foot of Third street,
along Long Bridge, past the Union Works,
around the sugar-house buoy and return,
when a refreshing dip in the brine is taken
as the conclusion of the night's work.
The prettiest race of tbe Stockton re
gatta will be the senior four-oared barge
event, in which will be entered the Pi
oneers, the South Ends, Stockton Athletic
Association, and, possibly, the Ariel Cluo.
The latter club is trying hard to organize
a crew, and has got together three
good menâ Henry *'rank. a crack athlete
of the Acme Club of Oakland; George
Phelan, the coming champion skiff-rower,
and Frank Wilson, a comparatively new
man at the oars, but the makings of a
great oarsman. A fourth man is anxious
ly being sought for, and when he is
found the crew will go into training im
mediately.
The Pioneer and South End crews, who
are the best of friends, both in a race and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1896.
out of it, are working tooth and nail to
get in the oest possible condition, and as
this will be each crew's last race the bitter
antagonism that is extant among them as
to which is the better crew will be wiped
out in a royal battle of the oars for blood.
The Stocktonian crew are smashing
away at the oars night and morning, and
as they are more than anxious to have a
crack at the local crew the most exhilar
ating four-oared race ever rowed will be a
feature of the day's sport.
Jim Foley, the entry in the junior shell
from the Bouth End Club, is fast reducing
bis avoirdupois, and looks to have a good
chance to win. He will have a strong
backing from his club members, and his
magnificent stroke and gorgeous costume
never fail to catch the ladies' eyes, as he
plies bis frail craft along the bridge, with
his Amazonian chest protruded ana head
high in tbe air. The ladies are often
heard to remark as he passes by, "Is that
Peterson?"
Knowing ones who have seen the South
End junior crew perform claim that their
chances of defeating tbe Stocktonian crew
are not of the brigntest.
The boys are good rowers, but their in
experience in rowing a barge against such
a crack crew as the Stocktonian one will
prove disastrous to them, thereby lessen
ing the South Ends' chances of winnine
every event on the programme, which
they are out to do.
The club is getting rather anxious over
the completion of their skiffs in time for
the races. Certain material to be used in
their construction had to be ordered from
the East, but as yet has not arrived and
when it does the boat-builder will put on
an extra force to have them completed by
September 9.
It is being rumored about that the Ala
meda junior crew is going to disband.
There seems to be some dissension among
its members. This crew and the Stock
tonian crew were looked upon as the win
ners of the junior four-oared race at the
Stockton regatta.
McCausland, the Ariel entry in the
senior single-scull event of the regatta, is
now rowing in great form. His now shell
is conceded to be much faster than his old
one, and with it he intends to give Du
plissea the race of his life.
It has been agreed upon by the mem
bers of the Ariel Club that Jim Wilson
and George Phelan shall both represent
the club in the senior outrigger event, and
that Frank Wilson and J. It. Bockman
shall row in the junior event. They also
have intentions of entering a junior crew
in the coming regatta.
CRICKET CHIRPS.
The Cricket Movement In France.
Grace's Monster Score.
The Frenchman will never make a
cricketer. Strenuous efforts were recently
made in the game's behalf at a college sit
uated just outside Paris. The movement
was, in a measure successful, and a month
ago "une grand match" was announced
with a flourish of trumpets. It is mel
ancholy to have to state that the issue of
the movement was tragical. A fiercely
delivered, full pitched ball struck an en
thusiastic batsman between the eyes. The
victim felt that not his head alone, but his
honor, had suffered. He demanded satis
faction of the erratic bowler, and a fear
ful, though bloodless duel ensued. While
the combatants are satisfied, the game has
been generally denounced by the nation
as barbarous.
As the English season nears its close
the inter-county matches attract more
and more interest. An important bearing
on tbe championship took place at Ken
nington Oval two weeks ago. It was tho
Surry and Yorkshire match, and resulted
in a victory for the former team by an in
nings and 61 runs. The fixture was made
for Lohmann's benefit, and there accrued
to that popular player the admission fees
of 52,000 spectatorsâ a record beater in the
wav of benefits.
The Australians beat Warwickshire by
an innings and 60 runs, and were defeated
by Earl de La Ware's eleven at Bexhill
on-Sea by 4 wickets.
Lancashire beat Gloucestershire by 4
wickets. Notts and Sussex had a draw.
The following team will represent Eng
land in their third contest with Australia,
to be played at the Oval: W. G. Grace, A.
E. Stoddart. K. S. Raniitsinhji, F. 8. Jack
son, Richardson, Gunn, Hayward, Abel
ana Lilley.
The last two places rest between Loh
man, Feel, J. T. Hearne and Captain
Wynward.
Surrey defeated Notts by 424 to 240, the
victor's score including five innings over
40.
Playing for Somerset against Middlesex
in a drawn match W. N. Roe, ex-greatest
scorer of the world, made 106 without
giving a chance.
In the Gloucestershire-Sussex match
Champion W. G. Grace made 301 of the
551, which gave the decision to Gloucester
shire.
The Canterbury week opened with a
match between Kent and Lancashire,
which resulted in a draw. Maclareu's
226 not out for Lancashire was the feature
of the event.
The scheduled cup match for to-morrow
is between the Alameda and Bohemian
Clubs at Golden Gate. . Umpibe.

YACHTING.
Everybody Away on the Cruise Up
the Sacramento.

River, mentioned last week, materialized
and, accordingly, there is little excitement
in the yachting world.
Most of those who take an active inter
est in sailing over the briny deep in their
swift little vessels have left their desks
and account-book 3 behind for the / exhil
arating sport of visiting the various towns
and cities on the line of the cruise and
taking life easy in hammocks the rest of
the time.
As soon as the yachts return with the
sun-tanned i pleasure-seekers > news of in
terest in yachting may be expected.
A watermelon cruise will be taken to
Goat Island to-day by the Oakland Navy.

TRIED TO ESCAPE.
A Burglar Jumps Into the Bay, but
Three Shots Fired at Him Makes
Him Return.
George Hansen, an ex-convict, has been
wanted by the police for the past two weeks
on the charge of burglary. He is accused
of breaking into the house of Albert Beck,
816 lowa street, on the night of August 4,
and stealing a lot of silverware.
Detectives Bee and Harper were detailed
on the case, and two days later they re
covered the stolen property in a pawnshop,
and from the description of the man who
pawned it they came to the conclusion he
was Hansen.
A description of Hansen was sent to the
different police stations, and Friday night
Lieutenant Bennett of the Potrero met
him on one of the wharves there. He
placed him under arrest, Dut he broke
away and jumped into the bay. He started
to swim away, and Bennett whipped out
his revolver and fired three shots at him.
The third shot scared him, and he swam
back. The lieutenant hauled him Dut of
the water and sent him to the City Prison,
where he was locked up in the tanks.
Yesterday afternoon the pawnbroker iden
tified him.
Hansen is a well-known petty thief, and
in August, 1893, he was sentenced to two
years in San Quentin for burglary.

To Whom It May Concern: In June, 1832, I be-
came" afflicted with kidney and other .troubles,
which seemed to affect the nerve centers of my
spine, which became so paralyzed that there was
no feeling there. ; I was confined to my bed most
of the time for sixteen months, and was ; treated
by three eminent physicians without success, and
after a i consultation they . informed ; me . that my
case was Incurable; but, as 1 was in no hurry
about dying, . I ; concluded to , try . Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt, so I purchased one and began using
it In two months I was able to work and was
soon entirely well and happy and gained fifteen
pounds. My health has since that time been good.
I am in no way : Interested in the sale of Dr.
Sanden's Electric " Belts, but ; I do â  cheerfully
recommend them to the afflicted. I would further
add that I have had this Belt since .November.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmef
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition!
â¢â ill produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V. , Aug. 21. -The market for
securities was feverish to-day, but business was on
a light scale. Transactions in stocks footed up
only 156,214 shares, the smallest total for any day
of the week. Speculation was feverish through
out and under the control \of several operators,
who are still working for lower prices. The street
was flooded with rumors of an unfavorable char
acter, but on investigation it was found that the
reports had no foundation in fact. Some of the
renorts were of a highly sensational character and
undoubtedly had something to do with the low
range of prices which prevailed during the after
noon session.
1 lie special feature of the trading was the heavi
ness of Western Union. The stock sold down 3
per cent to 73JygC and lacked support, throughout.
The heaviness of Western Union offset the good
effect of the gold importations, and this, with the
selling for foreign account, explains the downward
tendency of the market. . Reports of late-cutiing
at the West assisted the shorts in their work of
depressing prices. Railway earnings to hand for
the second week of the current month generally
showed decreases as compared with the previous
year, and were not without their influence. -
speculation left off weak in tone with prices 14Â®
3 per cent below yesterday's closing, Western Union
leading. In the inactive list Pullman Palace de
clined 2 to 140. Bonds were weak. â  Total sales
footed up 510,000. Atchtson general fours fell

CHICAGO, In,. Aug. 21 â Better prices were
obtainable for wheat this morning and the open
trading gave indications of an interesting session,
but appearances were deceptive, the subsequent
market differing but Immaterially from the ordi
nary and on occasions showing decided, dullness.
The strength Incident to the opening was ascribed
to a firm tone in New York stocks, which followed
a rather weak start. Later prices of wheat were
sustained principally by reported export sales at
New York and moderately good cash transactions
at this place. local operators were the best
traders, the outside being absent and showing no
evidence of taking even a slight interest
Receipts at Chicago were 106 cars, and 63,835
bushe were taken from store. The Northwest
had 478 cars, against 420 last Friday and 472 a
year a so. Liverpool cables were quiet and steady. '
Toward the cosnj? the firmness which bad pre
viously prevailed began to ooze out of the market
and prices receded gradually. Closing Paris
cables were unchanged to 20 centimes higher for
Hour and unchanged for wheat. Antwerp was
unchanged and Berlin %@% of a mark lower.
Export clearances were 247,058 bushels. Sep
tember wheat opened at from 65% cto 65% c, ad
vanced to 66i4@563/gc, closing at 66% c. S/gC
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow, 140 cars. â¢ *,'... :'.'â¢. â¢
CORNâ Was almost a dead issue, with the ex
tremely moderate fluctuations taking place merely
in token of recognition of the action of wheat. No
news of any Importance was received, and trad
ers were apparently Indifferent to the usual statis
tics Receipts we're 442 cars, 28 less than esti
mated, and 543,495 bushels were taken from
store. Liverpool cables were %d lower for fu
tures and %d higher for spot. neat clearances
amounted to 13t*,722 bushels. May corn opened
at 27c, sold at 26%@26%c. closing at 26% c, a
shade under yesterday. .Estimated receipts lor to
morrow 640 cars. "* > â  -
OATSâ Opened strong, but were rather Inclined
to drag later. The desire of September shorts to
cover with the strength derived from wheat was
the principal sustaining factor. Receipts were 203
cars and 73,540 bushels were taken from store.
The tone of the market later accorded with the
easier feeling in wheat. May oats closed l/gc lower.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow 283 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady; casn Northwestern and

PROVISION 8- With a slight recovery in prices
at the yards there was an equally fair improve
ment in product values. Trading was of a listless
and insignificant sort, however, and no feature de
veloped. January pork closed unchanged, January
lard 2%c higher and January ribs a shade lower.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 21.â R. G. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
Failures for the week have been 28 in the United
States, against 222 last year, and 47 in Canada,
against 43 last year. . :
Poll: leal events of the week had no . definite in
fluence I upon business prospects, for the phenom
enal variations in sterling exchange and the begin
ning of _ imports of ; gold, a! though > following 1 the
great meeting in Madison-square Garden on Tues
day, may be fairly I attributed to the accumulating
excess of - mercbandis â¢ exports â  over imports, to
which attention lias been repeatedly called.
--â ' Ivxpor s from New York for the past two weeks
have been 20 per cent larger and Imports 21
per cent smaller than last year. The rapid move
ment of grain and the unusually early market for
cotton tends strongly to aid the banking s-yndicate,
which : has undertaken *-, to â¢ regulate foreign ex
change. . .Â» â¢-"":â  . â â¢ ' - '
Withdrawals of money to the interior are rather
large and commercial loans are bard to place, and
this difficulty checks many new enterprises and
basin- ss . in many departments, i Bank > c.earings
are small for the week, 15 per: cent less than last
year ' Railroad earnings are not as good as might
be ected for the first half of August, exceeding
those of last year by only % per cent. .. 'â¢,â¢â â¢

1 The iron and steel manufacture has continued
depressed and Bessemer pig has sold at $10 40 at
Pittsburg, while southern No. 1 Is offers at prices
equivalent to $10 at ; New York, and 'nearly ail
finished products are being sod below the current
quo. at ions. There is rapid curtailment of pro
duction, but in spite, of this the supply of . finished
product appears to greatly exceed the ; demand
, for that. : The only bright spot is a sale of 9000
" tons of steel rails to Japan for refitting railways in
that country, which makes an aggregate of 46,000
tons exported during the year. â  â â â  >: , â 
i Nothing encouraging can yet be said regarding
the woolen manufacture, and the demand for
I goods, even at recent reductions, , is still disap
! pointingly small. A heavy auction sale of. cotton
goods brought prices which were counted quite en
couraging, and the current demand is fairly main- 1
tamed, although the mills are not inclined to make |
I large contracts for the future in view of the rise in
the raw material. In general the working force in j
the textile branches does not appear to have in- |
creased. - * â  â

To-morrow night the exposition will
close, and it can now be said that the ex
pectations of the directors, both as re-
Miss Elizabeth M. Sherman, Who inaugurated and Who Has Maintained the
Oldest Successful Vested Boy Choir in the State-
gards attendance and finance, have been
more than realized.
This afternoon the directors held a meet
ing and accepted the form of design for
the diplomas that will be presented to the
exhibitors to-morrow.
The following special awards have been
made: M. J. Keller Company, shirt man
ufacturers; Bay City Fiourmills: Pacific

A "ceneral" award has been made to
every exhibitor.
This afternoon the children from St.
Mary's and the parochial schools and from
the Grant, Ciawson and Durant schools
; were admitted free, aud in every sense of
the word they enjoyed "the liberty" of the
exposition, and a more happy and inter
ested crowd has never beeii seen within
its walls.
To-night the talent was supplied by East
Oakland. Assemblyman C. G. Dodge de
livered a short ocening address, and
Eugene Colby, James T. Preston and H.
A. Melvin rendered vocal solos. Miss
Minnie Hoppe gave a recitation.
Mrs. Grace E. Dodge, wife of the presi
dent of the evening, sang "Summer
Night" beautifully. She was heartly ap
plauded;
Ii was not generally known that thelady
was a vocalist, but her appearance on tbe
platform for the purpose of rendering a
vocal number was a surprise to a large
number of Oaklanders. The success wnich
| Mrs. Dodge achieved was nee less pro
! nounced than the surprise which her ap
pearance created. She possesses a rich
mezzo-soprano voice, and she sings with
intelligence and dramatic fervor.

District. This city being the logical center
of the district, the various elements in
the contest are naturally more in evidence
here than elsewhere.
Tarpey, as is well known, was a candi
date as delegate to the Democratic Na
tional Convention, and was also very
friendly with Robert Fitzgerald, who is
the recognized leader of the Daegett wing
in this county. As Mr. Dageett was not
anxious for Tarpey to go to Chicago, Dag
gett's friend, Fitzgerald, could not work
for him, and, as a result, Tarpey felt that
he had been thrown down and that his
Alameda friends had acted tbe part of
semi-traitors. As a result, Tarpey was
beaten, and received but a few votes. A
neat little scheme, it is said, has now been
outlined to salve the feeiings of Mr.
Tarpey.
Tbe plan is, as has been known for sev
eral days, to put up Tarpey for the sole
purpose of beating Warren English, and
Tarpey being tue most available man, is
being used by Daggett for that purpose.
When the matter was rirst broacned to
Tarpey he declined to be the candidate of
any faction and refused to enter the con
test except Warren English would support
him and he could also get the Populist in
dorse m en t.
As Daggett controls the State Central
i Committee he was in a position to instruct
Mr. Alford to place Tarpey, as chairman,
on the committee which has charge of
the task of looking toward tne fusion of
the Populists and Democrats.
Tarpey was then in a position where he
! could dictate and make terms.
At yesterday's conference the Populists
demanded that they be given four of the
Presidential electors. Tarpey made a
speech, saying that he was in favor of
giving them everything they wanted. He
stated thai the Populists had been advo
cates of silver longer than the Democrats,
j and that as silver is the predominating
question at the coming election it would
| do no harm to give the Popuiists all they
! ask for. The plan was then proposed that
I the Populists indorse Tarpey for the Third I
! D istrict in return for the Democratic in
| dorsement of the Populist candidate in
the First.
Tarpey believes that he can now get the
Populist nomination. Warren Engiish,
who has recently gone all over the dis
trict, declares that he has more than a
majority of all the Democratic delegates.
Green Majors ar.d Judge Gibson are both
anxious for the Populist indorsement and
are not particularly anxious that the Dem
ocratic State Central Committee should
have anything to say in the matter, and
it is regarded as certain that the fusion
proposition will lail and that both Podu
lists and Democrats will nominate in the
Third District.
Warren English and Tarpey had a con
ference to-day and it is hinted as among
the possibilities that Tarpey will with
draw and that Warren English will not
j make any strong overtures to the Popu
! lists, but will run on a straight Democratic
j ticket, in which he will have the support
of most of the local silver party.
This afternoon another development
came to life, and it is not altogether un
likely that Tom Garrity may apper in the
I field against English. In the last fight
Garrity worked for the Daggett wing, an
while doing so was told by Labor Com
missioner Ed Fitzgerald that he (Fitz
gerald) would support Garrity if he ran
for Congress. Yesterday Garrity, it is re
ported, received a letter from his friend
Tom McMahon of the Contra Costa Demo
cratic Committee, in which McMahon
states that Fitzgerald had asked his sup
port on behalf of Tarpey. Garrity re
proached Fitzgerald and the Labor Com
missioner at once replied that he was still
for Garritv, whereupon Garrity produced
McMahon's letter and what followed ia
not reported.
In view of these developments it is con
sidered improbable that the Populists will
change the date and place of their con
vention to suit the Democrats. The Popu
list Convention was originally set to be held
at Benicia on the 25th of August, and it
was proposed, while fusion was thought to
be possible, to transfer it to Vallejo and
postpone the date till September 4, at
which place and time the Democratic Con
vention will be held. It is now more than
likely that this deal will be declared off â
in fact, that it has already been declared
off, and that the Populists will hold their
convention at the place and time origin
ally proposed and will make their own
nominations, leaving English, Tarpey and
Garrity to snarl according to their tastes
for the Democratic bone.
As it is impossible for either the Demo
cratic or Populist candidate to be elected
in this district, and as the Republican ele
ments are faÂ«t harmonizing, it is certain
tliat Hilborn's majority will be very large.

"THE CALL" COMMENDED
Only Great Daily That Adver
tises Alameda County to
the World.
OTHER PAPERS MUST EXPLAIN.
Their Practice of Issuing Small Local
Editions Is Unanimously
Condemned.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,?
908 Broadway, Aug. 21. |
Albert Kayser, proprietor of the Oak
land Journal, and a director of the Board
of Trade, caused a great surprise at to
day's meeting of that body. He stated
that the San Francisco daily papers, with
the exception of The Call, ignored this
county's interest by only publishing the
news of Alameda County in the local
edition, and not even in the San Francisco
edition.
A. H. Breed, a real-estate dealer and a
member of the Republican County Cen
tral Committee, said:
"This is a matter of vast importance to
Oakland, that should receive the attention
of this board. We have this exposition
here to advertise and recommend Oakland
to the world as a city of enterprise and
suitable place to invest capital. The
papers of San Francisco, excepting The
Call, report the event in their Oakland
editions, and then omit it altogether in
their general edition, which reachet the
people we are trying to reach.
â¢'I v nderstand that The Call is the only
paper that does not countenance this kind
of work and I am in favor of passing a mo
tion requesting all of our members and
the public generally to discontinue their
subscriptions to the Examiner and Chron
icle until such a time as the management
of these papers feel that Oakland and Ala
meda County news is of enough im
portance to publish in their general edition.
If one of you were out in the State and
looked into the Examiner or Chronicle
you would never know that we were hav
ing an exposition here. I claim that it is
an outrage to treat us in such a manner."
Secretary Cragie Sharp said: "I know
that this statement is true and am in
favor of giving the papers due notice and
then passing such a resolution if they fail
to do the proper thing. Our people away
from home want to know the news when
they purchase a paper."
A. Kayser of the Oakland Journal ex
pressed surprise that such a charge was
possible. He said: "I never heard of such
a thing being done anywhere else. I un
derstand that the Examiner has four dif
ferent editions for four different sections
of the country."
A. D. Pryal favored the suggestions
made, as did C. A. Booth of the Oakland
Iron Works. The latter stated that he
never heard that the two papers were
doing sucb worK.
M. J. Keller moved that the tÂ»vo papers
in question be corresponded with and
their answers presented to the opening
meeting of the board to be held in the
near future. If the facts were as stated
he said the secretary should have a reso
lution prepared calling upon all members
and their friends to discontinue their sub
scriptions to the Examiner and Chronicle.
The motion was unanimously carried.
After the meetine Mr. Keller said:
"If it is really true that some of the
daily papers of San Francisco omit all the
Oakland news from their general edition
outside of that which is circulated in Oak
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
Mrs. Grace E. Dodge, the East Oakland Mezzo* Contralto, Who Appeared at thÂ»

land, it ought to be known by tbe people
at large.
"Very likely it is true, or Mr. Kayser,
himself a newspaper man, would not have
brought it up at the Board of Trade meet
ing to-day. I remember noticing such an
omission when away on a camping trip
some years ago. In looking for Oakland
news in the Examiner I could not find it.
"Mr. Kayser and others of the board be
lieve that the Chronicle also omits the
Oakland news from its general edition.
There is no charge that The Call treats us
in this way.
"The omission of the Oakland news
from the regular edition by any of the San
Francisco papers seems to me a business
blunder, to say tbe least. It is bound to
be found out and, of course, the paper will
be judged accordingly.
"The Oakland people frequently furnish
news to the San Francisco dailies with
the expectation of getting the benefit of
the general circulation; not only that, but
advertising is given for the Oakland pages
of those publications with the same view.
"Certainly Oakland is important enough
to be recognized in such a way. It is, so
far as news is concerned, a part of San
Francisco, and tbe news from all parts
round the bay should travel together
hand in hand. The idea that a great
daily published in one of the great cities
of the country, read all over the United
States and in other countries, should be
devoid of any news pertaining to its legit
imate territory seems unreasonable.
"It is hardly just to 100,000 people that
such an omission should be practiced."
THEY SING NOW
IN DEEPER KEY.
Reunion of St. John's Epis
copal Boys' Vested
Choir.
OLDEST ON THE COAST.
Formed by Miss E. M. Sherman
Ten Years Ago, Who Still
Directs It.
PURELY A LABOR OF LOVE.
Next Monday All Members and Ex-
Members Will Be Tendered
a Banquet.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway, Aug. 21. )
The tonth anniversary of what is said to
be the oldest continuous vested choir in
tbe State will be held at St. John's Episco
pal Church next Monday evening.
Ten years ago Miss Elizabeth M. Sher
man in the face of great opposition organ
ized a vested boy choir. As boys do not
remain in that stage of life for a decade
after they are old enough to cinq in a
church choir the reunion will be a very
interesting gathering.
Every little opposition had to be met
ten years ago, and worshipers who are
now accustomed to hear tbe exquisite
singing of the boys wonder how6verany
objection could have been raised. Miss
Sherman has worked very persistently,
and it has been a labor of love throughout
as she has worked as trainer and teacher
all the time without any salary whatever.
She has visited the public schools and has
kept the choir up to a high standard, and
her success has been the means oi en
couraging many others, and now vested
choirs are to be found everywhere.
Owing to the need of procuring new ma
terial every few years vested boy choirs
that had been started in other places were
abandoned, but St. John's has never been
without an able choir since the innova
tion was first made.
The members of the original choir were:
Roland Oliver, Arthur Agard, jack Nichol
son. John Petty. N. H. Barry, Mr. Finch,
Arthur Petty, Ellsworth Alden Akerly,
George Harris, Mason Bowen, George
Parry Akeny, Joseph Petty, Arthur
Kniver, James Ely ana Mr. Foster.
In the current number of the church
magazine Rev. F. J. Mynard says regard
ing tne reunion :
This date is worthy of special note for many
reasons. St. John's choir was almost the pio
neer choir of Its kind on this coast, and proba
bly is the only one which, being a success from
the start, can claim ten years of uninterrupted
work. It certainly is the only one which has
had no change in leadership for ten year.<=.
Miss Elizabeth M. Sherman, who organized
our first cr.oir, is still â  rectress, and has fully
j shown that in this capacity she has no superior
on the Pacific Coast. In this connection ona
feels llk'e attempting some description of the
unflagging zeal, the persistent purpose, the
almost unlimited energy and the rare devotion
which has held this one person to such work
and labor these ten years past; but no one
could do justice to the arduous service exacted
by the position and its duties tbrough all these
years save the one who hes performed them.
The plans for the day provide for a service
in the church at 8 o'clock p. ac. The present
choir will sing, and all ex-members of the
choir in good standing are invited to occupy
seats reserved for them near the chancel. We
hope to have an address by the Bishop at this
service. After the service, members and ex
members will adjourn to the "banquet hall,"
where, after refreshments are served, short ad
dresses will be delivered. We hope to have
the church filled to its utmost capacity with
enthusiastic parishioners who will be prepared
to make a special offering, in recognition of
the event, to the choir fund.

CHINESE TESTIFY
AGAINST WILLIAMS
They Swear That Money
Was Paid the Ex-
t lnspector
FOR LANDING FRIENDS.
Evidence of Bold Methods of
Extortion and Bribery
Produced.
THE THIRD INDICTMENT NOW.
Story of the Landing of Chin Cbay
Hnng* for $85 Last No
vember.
Charley Ah Him, who left Los Angeles
when the police objected to his presence
there, and since then maintained his rep
tation in connection with Chinese cases
and highbinder wars, sat between Attor
neys Coogan and Mowry yesterday dur
ing the third day's trial of Richard S.
Williams, ex-Customs' Inspector, charged
with extortion and corruption in office.
Charley wore an immense diamond ring,
and likewise the peculiarities of a Chinese
man about town, and he never once
allowed his interest in the proceedings to
drop. In this regard he was equally eager
with Williams to advibe the attorneys.
Chin Deck, the brother of one of the
Chinese alleged to have been landed by
"Williams, was recalled in the morning.
His testimony was a repetition of that
given Thursday, relating how his brother
had been landed by Williams upon the
payment of $100. Mowry took up Deck's
testimony that Wong Chong, the Chinese
landed, was a brotner of Chine Deck.
The point made was that of a Wong and a
Chin being of different families, but the
witness was equal to tbe occasion by ex
plaining he was only a half brother. >
Juryman Henry J. Crocker stated he
wanted to be clear on the point if Wil
liams, Wong Sam and Chin Deck were to
gether in Sam's room twice. Lyman
Mowry said that the witness had so testi
fied and he read'in the testimony of Thurs
day that Deck gave direct testimony to
that effect. The shorthand reporter read
his notes of Deck's cross-examination, in
which it was stated that Deck had not
been in Sam's private room twice. Count
ing the time the money was paid made the
secdnd time he saw Williams there.
J. J. Tobin, Deputy Collector, in reply
to questions regarding the assignment of
Williams to certain cases, said that he had
assigned Williams to some cases. The de
fense took exception to this line of testi
mony and the Deputy Collector was ex
cused.
The third indictment against Williams,
which was found on the landing of Ching
Chay Hung, November 13, was next
taken up.
The first witness on this count was
Ching Ying, a fruit-picker and laborer
now living in Chinatown. His brother,
Hung, he said, went to China in 1894 and
returned to the United States October 15,
1895.
The witness was acquainted with Wil
liams and saw him in connection with
the landing of Hunsr.
"Where did you meet him?"
"In front of tne Chinese theater and I
asked him why my brother nad not been
landed. He said, 'Go up to Wong Sam's
room and talk.' "
"Well, what did ne say then? :i
"He told me he wanted $100, as the case
was a. bad one. I told him I could not get
so mucti money, I was too poor, but if he
could get my brother landed I would
give ?35 or $50. Wong Sam was there at
the time. He said, "Yes, Ching Ying is
poor; if he can give $60 I will do some
thing for him. We can get his brother
landed.' Two eveninsrs later I met Wil
liams and he said, 'Don't let Wong Sam
attend to this case.' I told Williams I
had given $60 to Wong Sam and he said,
'Don't have him attend to it; you hurry
and get the money back from him.' "
"Did you have a conversation with Wil
liams about the money?"
"I said to him I couldn't give $100. but
if he would have my brother landed I
would give him $85.
"My brother was landed November 13,
and I saw Williams that night over the
theater on Washington street. I got the
money back from Sam and gave Williams
$60. He said: 'There is only $60 here; it
should be $85. If you don't get the rest
I'll have your brother arrested.' I went to
a friend and borrowed $25. My friend and
I sat together smokine, and Williams
came along and I paid him the $25. Wong
Kew Gim, my friend, was present when I
paid this money in the basement barber
shop at 806 Washington street."
Under cross-examination Ying statpd
that he was at San Jose when his brother
arrived. Two days later he received a
letter telling him to come to San Fran
cisco, and shortly after arriving here he
met Williams and Wong Sam. The wit
ness said to Sam that his family name was
Wong, and Lyman Mowry, for tbe de
fense, caught Ching on this statement, bnt
Ching, smiling blandly, replied, "I said
my family name is Cbing."
Wong Sam asked Ching why he had
come from San Jose, and what did Wil
liams want with him. Ching remarked it
was to land his brother. He repeated the
conversations he had with Williams re
garding the landing of Hung. Williams
cautioned him against having Wong Sam
in the case, and Ching replied he had
given Sam the money. Later, on Novem
ber 12, he offered William? $60 in the bar
ber-shop in the presence of Ah Fat, the
barber, but Williams refused it, and
threatened to arrest Ching's brother,
Hung. According to the witness, this
threat brought him to time, and lie bor
rowed the balance and paid Williams $85.
"Who took you to Major Moore's office
to make an affidavit?" Mr. Mowry asked.
"Wong Sam. I did not know the way,
and asked him to show me the office."
The witness stated that Wong Sam was
the official interpreter before Major
Moore. Ching also testified before the
Grand Jury, but he said it was not at the
request of Wong Sam, only his direction.
Mr. Mowry asked if the witness had not
been paid by Wong Sam to testify and
been instructed by Sam as to how he
should testify on cross-examination, but
got only exasperatingly evasive or nega
tive replies.
Barclay Henley for the prosecution
wanted to know wbat was the drift of this
course of questions.
"To shew tnat Wong Sam is at the head
and front of all these cases," said Attorney
Coogan of counsel for the defense, "we are
showing it slowly and surely all through
this case."
Wong Kew Gim testified that he loaned
$25 to Ching Ying in November in the bar
ber-shop. He saw Ying pay it to Wil
liams. The witness next swore that the
money was paid to an "American boy."
He failed to identify Williams in court.
The case was continued until Monday
morning.

A CLEVER CAPTURE.
Two Burglars Seen Leaving a House on
Eddy Street Are Followed
and Arrested.
Two burglars, who are snspected of be
ing the men who have been working hotels
and lodging-houses recently, were cleverly
captured yesterday afternoon by Detective
Graham and Policeman Jerry Dinan.
They are Frank Winn, an ex-convict, and
Joe Voisuett, who was one of the sur
vivors of the sealing schooner C. G. White,
which was wrecked in the Arctic Ocean
about a year ago.
Graham was standing on Eddy street,
between Mason and Powell, yesterday
afternoon, when he noticed Winn and
Voisne,tt acting in a suspicious manner.
He saw Winn enter the lodging-house, 11
Eddy street, and return in a few minutes
with a bundle under his arm.
They walked to Powell street and north
on Powell, followed by Graham, as far as
California street, when he tackled Winn,
who is the taller of the two. Dinan was
close at hand and soon the two burglars
were overpowered and the handcuffs put
on them.
When searched at the City Prison a
number of skeleton keys and apiece of
candle were found in Winn's pockets.
The bundle contained a suit of clothes.

XJ Bush and Gert's pianos; clearing-out prices
will rule. A. L. BANCROFT & CO., 324 Pos: St.
ON ACCOUNT OF THE INCREASE IN. MY
piano business, my old quarters on Market
st. are entirely too small; I have therefore moved
into my own building, at 526 Hayes st., between
Octavia and Lacuna, where ' I can now : display
over four times the amount of . instruments I than
formerly; as I buy lor . cash and in carload lots
and have no rent to pay I can offer any one desir-
ing a piano or organ better value for less money
than any other music house In San Francisco.
Respectfully yours, J. HARRY SCOTT.

FORAKER AND
TELLER COMING,
Efforts Being Made to Have
" Them Speak in This
State. .
STARS OF THE FORUM.
One Will Speak for Tariff Pro
tection and the Other
for Silver.
PLANS OF THEIR PARTISANS.
McLaughlin in Correspondence With
Forakerâ Teller May Speak in
Five Cities.
Foraker and Teller, two of the greatest
orators of the tnited States, will in all
probability be heard by the people of Cali
fornia during the coming campaign.
Chairman McLaughlin of the Republi
can State Central Committee is now in
correspondence with the Republican Na
tional Committee with the object of hav
ing the eloquent Senator from Ohio come
out here, and George W. Baker, the chair-
SENATOR HENRY M. TELLER of Colorado, Who Is Expected to
Arrive on This Coast Shortly to Lecture.
man of the Silver party of California, is
endeavoring to make arrangements to have
the great silver advocate of Colorado open
the silver campaign in this State.
"I have written to the National Com
mittee," said Chairman McLaughlin, when
asked about the matter yesterday, "asking
that Senator Foraker be sent to California
to aid the party in the coming campaign.
But the Senator was preparing to go to
Europe when the matter was submitted to
him and was unable to give a positive an
swer, as he did not know when be would
be back from his contemplated trip. He
stated, however, that he would very much
like to come to this State to speak for the
party, and added that if it was at ail pos
sible for him to find tne time when he re
turned he would certainly mate the trip.
"That is the wav the matter now stands,
but we shall allow no etiance to go by
which will aid us to carry out this idea of
bringing so able and so well-known a man
to the assistance of the party in California.
As soon as he returns from Europe the
subject will again be called to nis atten
tion and to that of the National Commit
tee."
Little more than a week ago George W.
BaKer wrote a letter to Senator Henry M.
Teller requesting him to come 10 Califor
nia to open the campaign for the freecoin
age of silver some time between the 25th
and 30th of the current month. Senator
Teller was away at the time the letter
reached his home and it was opened by
his private secretary, who replied to Mr.
Baker, informing him of the fact that the
Senator was away in the interior and add
ing that immediately upon his return the
communication of Mr. Baker would be
submitted to him and his determination
telegraphed to Mr. Baker.
In speaking of the matter last night Mr.
Baker said :
"It was our wish to have Senator Teller
with us this month, but that I find is now
impossible, as he has Eastern engage
ments which will keep him there tor some
Jittle time yet. I am confident, however,
that he will corue to California, and his
first appearance will be the occasion of the
SEW TO-DAT.

greatest gathering of silver people that
this State has ever seen. A telegram is ex
pected from him any day informing us
whether he will be able to come to the
coast, and fixing the date of his depar
ture.
"It is our purpose to have him sp^ak in
five of the cities of the State. These cities
will be San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oak
land, San Jose and Sacramento."
It is known that the idea of having Sena
tor Teller come to California was inspired
by the p!an of having the great economic
issues of the campaign discussed at the
Sacramento State Fair. When the mat
ter was mentioned to Mr. Baker he imme
diately offered to furnish the speaker on
the silver question, and said that he would
pledge himself to bring the Colorado
orator to California and to have him dis
cuss the benefits of the free coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to lat the great
State Fair symposium.
HEARTLESS CRUELTY.
A Gripman Allows a Mission - Street
Car to Run Cver a Valuable
Gordon Setter.
Michael Kelly of the City Corporation
Yard reports the loss of a valuable wnite
Gordon setter under peculiarly aggra
vated circumstances of cruelty. On Thurs
day evening shortly after 8 o'clock the
animal was run over by car 1020 of the
Mission-street line, being so severely in
jured that policeman 68, who happened
to be near by, in mercy ended its suffer
ings by shooting it through the head.
The howls of the suffering brute and the
report of the pistol attracted quite a
crowd and execrations of the gripman's
heartlessness were many and unsparing;.
"Confound you!" exclaimed J. L. Fer
ren of 1011 Mission street, shaking his fist
at the gripman, "If that dog were mine I
would shoot you dead."
"Ta, ta!" was the gripman's airy re
sponse as the cai sped off, leaving naught
but a pool of blood and- the echo of a
mocking laugh in its wake.
Instances of a similar sort have been re
ported with some frequency at the office
of the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals, four having been sent in
during the present week. Complaints of
the reckless brutality evinced by certain
gripmen of the road will, it is said, soon
be presented in court.

ON ACCOUNT OF A SIGN.
Manufacturers and Producers Hold a
Special Meeting.
A special meeting of the Manufacturers'
Association was held yesterday afternoon,
called by President Julian Sonntag for
the purpose of discussing the action to be
taken in the matter of the large sign
placed across the Pavilion reading, "The
Mechanics' Fair."
It was decided on motion of Director

A committee of four was appointed by
the president to attend that meeting and

A strange man was discovered in Jus

Monday last by Mrs. Field. The man
made a rush to get away, but was stopped
by Mrs. Field and asked what he was do
ing there.
The man hesitated and stammered,
finally saying that he was a messenger
from the White House, and had been sent
with a bundle of goods. He was asked to
explain, as no , goods 5 had been ordered,
but the man took his departure before he
! made an explanation. Shortly afterward
a . purse containg $6. belonging fto ? the

THE INGLESIDE OFFICIALS
Captain J. H. Rees and J. W.
Wilson to Occupy the
Judges' Stand.
A Splendid Outlook for the Coming
Seasonâ October 28 to Be the
Opening Day.
When the Ingleside track reopens the
face of Joe Murphy, the St. Louis ex
newspaper man and turfman, will be
missed from the stand. The position of
presiding and associate judges of the Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club have been offered
and accepted by Captain James H. Reea
of Memphis, Term., and J. W. Wilson of
Sacramento. Captain Rees is, without
doubt, one of the most popular turfmen
that ever paid this part of the country a
visit, and Mr. Wilson will be remembered
as the gentleman who created such a fa
vorable impression b7 his rulings while
tilling the position of presiding judge
during the latter part of the past racing;
season at Ingleside after the departure of
Captain Rees for tne East.
Touching on the coming racing season
Secretary Leake of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club is in receipt of a letter from
Captain Rees in which the genial Southern
turfman says:
"If all the horsemen go to San Fran
cisco this winter that say they are going
you will have to have a line of *Ãbles to
the ocean."
This is certainly good news for the local
racegoers.
President A. B. Bpreckels of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club and President Williams
of the California Jockey Club held a con
sultation yesterday, at which it was de
cided that the California Jockey Club
would open the racing season this fall on
October 19 and continue until and in
cluding October 27.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club will com
mence its meeting on October 28 and con
tinue two weeks, alternating every two
weeks thereafter with the California
Jockey Club until March 28, 1897, the date
of the expiration of the agreement exist
ing between the two associations.
The change of the date of the opening of
the meeting was necessary in order not to

in this City reors/anizins: the local lodge.
This appointment is but one of the fea
tures of the reorganization of Elks now in
progress here.
A new lodge is to be instituted early
next week, founded upon the best mem
bers of the former lodge, with the addi
tion of men of prominence in professional
and society circles in this City.
In fact the Eiks are to make a fresh start
with a membership that in itself will com
mend the order. Mr. Brown at once ac
cepted the appointment tendered him
yesterday. Other changes ot an official
nature will be made in the next tew days.
It will be remembered that Mr. Det
weiler came out here a few days ago from
Honisburg, Pa., for the express purpose of
investigating the dissension that had been
known to exist for some time in the lodge
of Elks in San Francisco. He found that
there had been two factions and that each
had blackballed the names Droposed by
the others until it was not possible to in
crease the membership.
There was also something said in regard
to the Elks' annual carnival ball in the
Mechanics' Pavilion, having been one of
the subjects in dispute. Mr. Detweiler,
after making a careful examination of the
situation, revoked the charter, declared
against carnivals and prepared to reor
ganize with the material best calculated
to insure an amicable and successful
future.

DID NOT GET A QUORUM
The Grand Jury Thereupon Ad
journed for One
Week.
Expert Dunn to Examine the Books
of the Edison Light and Power
Company.
The regular weekly session of the Grand
Jury was not held yesterday because a
quorum could not De obtained. This is the
first time since the jury was organized last
December that an adjournment has been
taken on account of the absence ol mem
bers.
The expert of thegury, Horace D. Dunn,
was on the sick list for several days. He
reported for duty last Thursday. He has
been instructed to examine the books and
accounts of the Edison Light and Power
Company in order to ascertain if any
money has been expended by this corpora
tion to obtain favor from the Board of
Supervisors.
The foreman and secretary of the Grand
Jury have not received any intimation
that the company will place obstacles in
the path of this examination. It is ex
pected that the expert will begin the in
spection next Monday.
Yesterday A. P. Black, Assistant Dis
trict Attorney, communicated with Regis
trar Hinton to ascertain if the latter had
some case 3of illegal registration which
ought to be investigated by the Grand
Jury. It was agreed that the Registrar
should place in the hands of the District
Attorney all the important facts de
veloped by the examination of the Regis
trar's lists, and the Grand Jury at the ses
sion to beheld Friday will get the facts
from the District Attorney.
Registrar Hinton has positive proof that
one applicant for a place on the precinct
board gave a talse return of his residence
in order to secure the appointment.
The Registrar does not regard the en
rollment of 73,000 names as indicative of
bogus registration. He fi nred that 74,000
voters would be registered, hence the
number enrolled falls 1000 short of his cal
culations.
