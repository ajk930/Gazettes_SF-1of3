VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 174.
SILVER IS NOT
THE MAIN ISSUE
Chairman Hanna Outlines
the Future Policy of
Republicans.
Legislation ot the Administra
tion Will Win Friendship
of Workingmen.
In Addition to This the Work of
Education Will Be Continued Dur
ing the Next Four Years
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 20.âChair
r man Hanna of the Republican National
Committee had a conference here to-day
with F. W. Peck of Chicago, in which Mr.
Hanna outlined the future policy of the
Republican organization and the McKin
ley situation. Mr. Hanna also discussed
in a confidential manner the last cam
paign. This interview, according to Mr.
Feck, is as follows:
"The Republican party," said Mr.
Hanna to Mr. Feck, "will not have such a
close call again as it had in the last cam
paign. The work of education is to be
continued strongly from the present until
the next Presidential election. This will
be done because the other side will work
during the next four year-, and if we do
not counteract their efforts they will win
next time. The policy of the administra
tion will be in exploitation of the ideas
that will further advance the strength of
the Republican party.
â¢'The one great power for Bryan was the
workingrnan. Bryan posed as their friend
and succeeded in getting them practically
in line, but the tight at the polls was not
so much betwecu gold and silver as it was
the fight of the worfcingmen against the
man they thought was the exponent of
trusts and monopolies. They were led to
believe that McK.niey was the candidate
- of the trusts, and, not to mince matters,
was my candidate, and that I was the
head center of the Republican party. The
Popocrats very adroitly made me the
whole thing and called me the oppressor
of the laboring man. 0. course I can
stand that sort of thing, but with Mc-
Kinley it is another thing. The labor
leadeis here, who are friendly to me, tell
me that if we are to be successful again
we must counteract this impression, and
that is what we propose to do. We cannot
do anything with the fa men. They have
left us. but we ran et tbe iabor vote, and
wo &hatl begin now to direct it that way
from Bryan and his party."
"How will Mr. McKinley do this?"
"Why, he knows too well that something
more than the mere assertion that the Re
publican party is the friend of the wort
lngman is necessary, and National legis
lation will be so handled that it will be the
best educator of tne people. 9 '
Mr. Hanna said further to Mr. Peck:
' "Tbe fight of silver against gold was
practically abandoned by the Democrats
two weeKs before the campaign closed. It
will never again be the main issue â that
is, silver as an issue will never cut any
more figure than greenbacks. The one
idea must be to instill into the minds of
the men of the cities that Republicanism
is as liood and belter than Popocracy. Only
Jet McKinley be inaugurated President of
the United States and this wi.l be done. I
have no aoubt but that the result will be
all we hope. There must be an arrange
ment that will strike the people at the
right time. McKinley will assume a
dignified attitude of antagonism to ail
trusts an 1 monopolies. His inaugural
will breathe the spirit of abhorrence lor
the centralization of such power as is to
day possessed by tbe trusts, and then we
will expect the understanding of the peo
ple to do the rest.
, '-Four years hence will come the next
Presidential election with the election of
a Congress. Then we shall have a tariff
measure introduced. This measure will
be close y identified with McKiniey. On
that measure we shall make the Presiden
tial campaign of 1900. On tbe tariff agita
tion we shall rely to win the battle.
â¢'The National Democrats will be with
us in 1900. Bonrke Cochran s-aid to me
. When I was in New York that there was
no use of their fighting us; that they
could not fight us successfully on tbe
â¢tariff and that there was no other point on
which they and we differed; the only
thin- left for them to fight for was the
Dame."
Mr. Peck broueht with him an invita
tion from the Union League Club of Chi
â¢ cago to attend a banquet to be given in his
bonor two weeks hence. Mr. Hanna de
clined the invitation and in giving his
reason stated that he had declined a simi
lar invitation from New York brought by
General Horace Porter. The reason given
â  by Mr. Hanna f>r declining both invita
tions lies in bis de.-ire to remain in
the background now that McKinley is
' elected.
"Many persons," said Mr. Hanna,
"principally the Popocrats, have eiven
expression to the statement that I dictate
to McKinley, and that I, rather than he,
am the real President. Such an idea
might seem substantial did I accept such
invitations as you and my friends in New
York propose."
Turning to the last campaign Mr. Hanna
said:
"Here in this town the Popocrats suc
ceeded in gaining the labor vote. The re
sult was that we lost 5000 votes. The re
sult in Ohio, however, was the largest
majority ever given to a Presidential can
didate, for, while the plurality was smaller,
being about 51.000, the majority and tbe
plurality were about the same. This was
due to the lact that party lines were very
closely drawn and tbe Prohibition and
Populist parties were practically wiped
out."
â  Mr. Peck inquired about the statement
-hat had been published to the effect that
had 30,000 votes been distributed in sev
eral close States it would have elected Mr.
Bryan.
"That is true," said Mr. Hanna. "Harry
Payne was the firm to give v terance to it,
but although it is true the fact is equally
true that the Republican vote in the coun
The San Francisco Call
try at large was kept up to its normal
condition; that is, the Republican per
centage of gains more than offset the
Democratic gain-."
Relative to matters concerning the Cabi
net Mr. Hanna said:
"The most difficult problem McKinley
has is the formation of his Cabinet. He
is a man who, above all thines, dislike* to
injure the feelings of any one. There are
so many men eligible and who are friends
of McKinley that he fears to appoint one
man Jor fear others will feel as/crieved.
That is the quality that in him attracts all
men and shows tho big heart that lies
within him."
Early this evening Mr. Peck went to
Canton to see President-elect McKinley.
MIiJEA VISI S .UcKIMjE?.
President- Elect and Commanding-Gen
eral i onfer am to thr Har Port/olio.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 20.â The general
commanding the armies of the United
States and a conspicuous member of Con
gress were among Major McKinley's
callers to-day. General Miles arrived
about half-past 4 o'clock, accompanied by
Frank Wiberg of Cincinnati, one of the
most widely known men of that city in
business anil commercial circles. General
Miles went at once to Mr. McKinley's
house and was most cordially greeted by
the President-elect. When General Miles
and Mr. Wiberg entered the study they
found General Grosvenor there, he having
arrived earlier in the afternoon. General
Miles and Mr. Wiberg 1 ad a talk In pri
vate with Major McKinley before his de
parture. The visit of General Miles was
of a social nature. The general is not a
candidate for the post of Secretary of War
and has no ambition outside of his mili
tary career. It is not unlikely Major Mc-
Kinley discussed with him some of the
men who are talked of in connection with
the place now held by Lamont. General
Grosvenor had a long talk with Major
McKinley on the state of the Nation. He
dwelt upon the action of Congress next
winter, and had a good deal to say about
the Dingley bill, the passage of which he
opposes for the reason that he thinks it
would not be a satisfactory settlement oi
the tariff question.
FOR THE I NAUGURATION.
Xational League of Eepublicnn Clubs to

CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 20.â A large at
tendance and abundant entnubiasm
marked the meeting of the National
League ol Republican Clubs' Executive
Committee at the Auditorium Hotel head
quarters to-day. The members present
were: President D. D. Woodmansee; Sec
retary M. J.Downling, Minnesota; Sena
tor Isaac M. Hamilton, S. W. Raymond,
ex-President W. W. Tracy and Albert
Campbell, Illinois; F. L. Edinborough,

v The main subject before the committee
was the Presidential inauguration cere
monies next March and the. part which
the league shall take in them. The league,
as a body, has never participated , in in
augurations, but this time it is intended
to make a great: demonstration of the
league* numerical strength. President
Woodmansee, being from Ohio, 1 is anxious
that the league shall make a fine showing.
A committee of five, of which the presi
dent trill be chairman, was ordered to cor
respond with Chairman Harina and the
inaugural committee at Washington to
ascertain what position the league will
have in the ceremonial and the parade
especially. The committee will go to the
capital soon and make arrangements for
the league with the local committee.
President Woodmansee appointed as his
stuff officers lor the inauguration the
members of 'he executive committee, one
from each Stat-.Â«. It is proposed to pro
vide a league escort, composed of mem
bers from the different States, for Major
McKinley from Canton to Washington.
Uniformed clubs of the league in Tennes
see, Ohio, New Jersey, Kentucky, New
York, Rhode Island and Maryland have
already applied to the Secretary for a
place in the inaugural parade. It is ex
pected that 50 000 members of the league
and clubs affiliated with it can be assem
bled for tbe inaugural parade. The league
will have headquarters in Washington
during inaugural week.
For the first time in six years tho ex
ecutive committee has met to find the
league out of debt, and t: ere was mutual
congratulation thereat. It was the *ense
ot the meeting that the wors of sending
out party literature should be continued
during the next four years as far as money
in the treasury would co to pny for the
expense, instead of waiting until a Presi
dential camoaign was at hand. The ex
ecutive committee intends, however, to
keep clear oi the financial shoals here
after.
It was decided to keep the headquarters
here. Washington, Cincinnati and New
York were proposed. Plans are already
being laid for the next annual convention
at Detroit in July. President Woodman
see has the assurance of Major McKinley
that he will be present unless something
unforeseen occur*.

New York, June 21, 1892.
My Dear Mr. President: Since our interview
on Saturday I have given the most earnest
thought and sought the best information on
which to base a judgment upon the question
of Secretary of State. The office is one of the
most attractive In ' the ; Government, and was
rendered doubly so by the ; cordiality of your
tender of it. 80 prominent and confidential a
relation with yourseli : and j your administra
tion would be in every way most agreeable to
me. : I throw aside, in considering the subject,
a large and remunerative trust which I must
resign, and view the appointment as it may
affect the present campaign. ' â ?â¢' 'â  â -â 
First, and above all other things, I am anx
ious for your success In the coming election.
That, in my judgment, is of the greatest mo
ment for the bust interests of the country and
for the future of the } Republican \, party. Our
canvass is extraordinarily, free from defensive
or explanatory matters â  and -presents unusu
ally aggressive strength. One prominently
identified with railway management coming
iiito the Cabinet at this late hour and in the
beat of the campaign might lead to an effort to
raise new issues in the few States where tuck

to-morrow and visit s veral cities in the
East to confer vith various leaders of the
National Central Democratic Committee.
It is possible tbat after his return a meet
ing ot the National coauniaee of which fc*

It is intended to keep the organization of
the National Democratic party intact.
The leaders of tbe National Democratic
party have noted with care the evident
intention of Altgeld, Brvan and other
leaders of the late cumpaign to hold
thb party in line for silver and all the
other pianks of the Cuicago platform and
this gives them an additional incentive
for holding their organization intact.
They believe that when the next primaries
are be-d they can call their own primaries
and bring into them fully half of wnat
was a year aco the Democratic party and
mat in many localities they wili be able
to capture the partjr. In speaking of the
future Mr. Bynum said:
"The National Democratic party will
last as long as theie is any danger to tbe
country from agitation along the lines of
tbe Chicago platform."

"The grotesque story that William K.
Vanderbllt had contributed $200,000 to the
Republican campaign fund has already
been contradicted by the treasurer of ibe
National Committee. The gossip-mongers
arc not content, however, to have so
toothsome a morsel taken from their
mouths. Accordingly they have now re
vived the story in a new lorm.
14 â¢Sometlnnc or other,' they say, 'Mr.
Vanderbilt did or said has led to such an
appreciation that he is to be rewarded
with a high foreign mission.' The story
havinir been brougbt to Mr. Vanderbllt's
attention he at once said that he had not
the remotest idea anything of the sort was
to be done, but if it were offered to him ne
would refuse to accept it; that th. re was
ab-olutely no office in the gift of tbe Gov

HAVANA. Cuba, Nov. 20.â 1t is offi
cially announced that on Wednesday last
tbe column commanded by General Lopez
Amor and the forces under Colonel Ar
minan met two insurg' nt bands led by
Serano Sanchez. The insurgents occupied
good positions, which commanded the
passage to the river Zazas.
After an engagement which iasted two
hours the troops fought their way across
the river, dispossessed the rebels and en
camped in the position that bad been held
by ttiem. The insurgents carried their
wounded witti them in their retreat It is
stated that the rebels buried sixty of their
number killed in the fight.
Cuban sympathizers deny the truth of
the Government report and say it is in
credible that the insurgent troops should
stop to bury their dead. The Spanish
losses are said to have been one lieutenant
killed and two lieutenants and twenty
privates wounded.
Several other reports of unimportant
engagements in which the Spaniards were
uniformly victorious have been issued by
the Government.
Operations in the province of Pinar del
Rio are partly at a standstill. There has
been no serious engagements witn the
rebels. No information is vouchsafed re
garding tbe resignation of General Wey
lcr, and the impression grows here that
the authorities know nothing of it. He is
unofficially located at San Cristobal, but
nothing definite is known as to his where
abouts.
General Luqne reports that the rebel
leaders, Sanchez and Molez, have been
killed and Carillo wounded.

BISHOP KEANE' S LOSS FELT.
Cardinal G bbons Says Nice Things About
the Work of the Rector of the
Catholic University.
BALTIMORE. Md., Nov. 20.â At the
meeiing of r>e board of director* of the
Catholic University at Washington last
mnnth Cardinal Gibbons, president of the
board, was requested to prepare a letter
expressive of the sentiments of the mem
bers for the late rector, Bishop Keane.
This letter his Eminence immediately
prepared. It spoke of the keen regret felt
L .â  the directors at the departure of Bishop
Keane, ot bis long labor in behalf of the
university, of his disinterestedness and of
the general sorrow over the relinquish
ment of bis duties. The Cardinal said in
conclusion:
"Your noble soul has grown from ynur
noble undertaking. You :>ave proven the
efficiency of the university to train young
men to generous self-forgetfulness ior the
welfare of others in your sub ime resigna
tion to the will of the Holy father. You
are the masterpiece of your own training.
When in future we snail have occasion to
point to an example for the imitation of
young men who will reap the fruit of your
labors we shall fool an honest pride in set
ting before them the first rector of the
university, the generous, high-minded,
much-beloved Bishop Keane."
The reply of Bishop Keane has just been
received. The letter is dated from San
Jose, Cal., and is as follows:
Your Eminence: I most gratefully return
thanks to your Eminence and the board of di
tectors of the university for the exceedingly
kind sentiments conveyed to me by your Emi
nence's letter of October 31. lam very far
from flattering myself that I deserve a tithe of
the praise prompted by the goodness and the
sympathy of your own generous hearts.
Whlie I did my best for the Interests of the
great work to which obedience has conse
crated my energies, yet I was always conscious
that my best was far from teing up to the re
quirements of the case: hence I have not for a
moment questioned the wisdom of the Holy
Father in desiring a change of administra
tion. May the blessings of Providence and
the loyal co-operation of our Catholic people
prosper the university in all of its future.
Gratefully and affectionately, your Emi
nence's servant in Christ, John Keane.

HELPLESS ON THE OCEAN.
Thrilling Story of the Loss of a Bark and
the Terrible Sufferings of the
Survivors.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa.. Nov. 20. â A
thrilling story is told by Peter Manner ot
Bath, Maine, on â â¢ of the survivors of the
wreck of the petroleum bark Charles R.
Flint, which while petroleum laden from
New York to Japan caught fire. Manner
arrived here from Liverpool yesterday on
board the American line steamship In
diana.
For eighteen days the crew existed in
small boats, roasted by the sun of the
tropics, and when they finally reached
Pernambuco they were more dead than
alive. The ship caught fire, it is thought,
through spontaneous combustion, and
after being abandonea on April 21 in lati
tude 5 deg. south, longitude 31 deg. west,
she drifted ashore twelve miies from
Cerea, Brazil, where a small portion of
her cargo was saved.
The voyage was uneventful until April
21, just at daybreak, when the cry ot tire
was given by the morning watch. In an
instant the flames burst open the hatches
and all band* were piped on deck and sent
into the boats half clad, none too soon, as
hardiy had the boats touched the water
when dense volumes of smoke shot from
below and the vessel was enveloped in
flames. The position of the crew was a
perilous one and in a few minutes they
were adrift with neither food nor water.
For days and nights Manner and the rest
of the crew drifud about helplessly, suf
fering the pangs of hunger and thirst and
with little hope of ever being saved.
Manner's memory is not of the best, and
he couid not recall the names of any of
his comrades. They were all strangers to
him when he shipped at New York. All
were saved, however, ai.d some ?hipped
in other vessels from Pernambuco. He
was sent to Liverpool by the American
Consul and from there was given passage
to Philadelphia by the Indiana.
INGERSOLL SERIOUSLY ILL
Paroxysmal Attacks of Pain Wrench the
Form* f the Celebrated Ag
nostic.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 20.â Paroxysmal
attacks ot pain wrencted the form oi
Robert G. ligersoll while he tossed on a
sick bed in the Great Northern Hotel to
night. No one was permitted to -cc him
but physicians ancthisdau tr.er, Maude,
who bas accompanied liim on bis lecture
tour, and his secretary, C. P. Farreil.
The condition of Colonel Ingersoll is
serious. He iias canceled ail the remain
ing dates of his lecture tour in which he
was engaged when he was stricken. His
malady is pronounced to be sciatica.
Reports from El^in and Freeport, in the
latter of which cities the lecturer canceled
engagements, gave a more serious view of
tbe colonel's illness. At Elgin the state
ment was made that the orator had been
stricken with au attack resembling paral
ysis.
He reached this city this evening at 5
o'clock and was driven to tbe Great North
ern Hotel. Chief Clerk Whipple made
special arrangements to provide comfort
for the guest until he should feel able to
continue his journey to New York.
Mr. Farreil said that Colonel Ingersoll
was able to proceed to New Yorit, leaving
to-morrow over the Lake Snore and Mich
igan Southern at 10 o'clock unless a worse
attack should take place during the night.
"His attack is serious and the pain he
is suffering is apparently so great that it
seems almost impossible for him to bear
up under it, but we believe that he
will soon recover. He suffered much
from the same malady, ' said Mr.
Farreil, "when he was a boy, but this is
the first attack he has felt since tbat time.
The pains are confined to the left leg, ex
tending from the hip to the foot."

William J. Bryan, Senator Jones, Gov

are enjoying a short sojourn at this place
went hunting yesterday, but tlielate Pres

the other hunters. The shooting of a deer
yesterday was the event of the trip. It is

weeks ago, but in honor of Mr. Bryan the
rule was suspended and the chief guest of
the party was invited to have a shot at
one of the fleet-footed animals. About
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon the party
found a doe. The deer was not badly
frightened and stood its ground until Mr.
Bryan sent a bullet into its left side. The
party will leave on Saturday as Mr. Bryan
has to be in Denver next Tuesday.

FOB WORDEN'S LIFE
Appeals to Governor Budd
on Behalf of the
Striker.
Moved by Friendship for the
Condemned Man's Aged
Mother.
The State's Executive Will Grant a
R prieveâ Huntington Favors
Clemency.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 20âPresi
dent Cleveland has addressed a personal
iett^r to Governor Budd of California ap
pealing for executive clemency in the case
of t-alter D. Worden, convicted of wreck
ing a train in Yolo County and causing
loss of life during the railroad strike of
1594. Since the convicuon of Worden the
President has interested himself in tha
young man's behalf, he having, in 1895,
invited the aid of Senator White to obtain
a reprieve for the prisoner.
The crime committed was not against
the Federal Government, and it was said
at the White House to a Call correspond
ent to-night that President Cleveland's
request was not made in his capacity as
chief magistrate of the Nation, but as a
citizen, and it was further explained by
Private Secretary Thurber that the Presi
dent knew and had formed a warm friend
ship for the mother of Worden when she
was a music teacher in New York State,
some time before Mr. Cleveland's election
to the gubernatorial chair of that com
monwealth.
BELIEVES MORDER INSANE
President Cleveland -pÂ»ak* a* a Private
. Citizen. . .
SACKAMENTO, Cal., â  Nov. Salter
D. Worden, who is how under sentence of
death, the day of execution being fixed
for December 18, for the wrecking of a
railroad train, during the big railroad
strike 'of 189-1, will be reprieved by Gov
ernor Budd until the Ist of May next, in
order to allow the executive an oppor
tunity to thoroughly examine into all the
circumstances of Worden's alleged crime
and conviction, and also to afford him a
chance to obtain expert medical opinions
on Worden's sanity.
Worden's cause is pleaded by the chief
executive of the Nation, Senator White
having placed in Governor's Budd's hands
a copy of the following letter from Presi
dent Cleveland:
Executive Mansion, )
Washington. D. C, Feb. 8, 1895. j
My Dear Senator: When I saw you a few days
ago I spoko of the case of young Worden, sen
tenced to be hauged in California for train
wrecking, causing death. You said you would
communicate wiih the Governor on the sub
ject and suggest a commutation, if consistent
with executive duty. I have just four.d on my
table a letter Jrom the distressed mother, which
1 inclose with another accompanying it when
It reached Mrs. Cleveland. I remember this
poor mother as a happy wife many years ago,
and as the past is tenderly recalled to me by
her letter, my sympathy is very much aroused.
I see one of the letters mentions tbe date
fixed for the execution as the 12th, but inas
much as the writer seems to be uncertain and
this is Friday, the day of the week usually se
lected. 1 am afraid tnit may be the day. If
there is any justification for merci:ul interfer
ence, <t might be exercised for the sake of an
aged and broken-hearted mother. Yours, very
truly, Grover Cleveland.
Hon. Stephen M. White, U. S. Seuate.
Worden's mother, alluded to in this
communication, was an old neighbor
and friend of the President's parents, who
had befriended her in her girlhood days,
and the letter referred to was a touching
appeal she had addrefced to the President
on behalf of her erring boy in tbe name of
his (Mr. Cleveland's) sainted mother.
Mr. Cleveland is acting in this case not
as President of the United States, but as a
private citizen. He says he was an inti
mate friend of Worden's family, all of
whom were most excellent people. When
he was a young man and Saiter D. Wor
den's mother was a young woman, who
made her living as a music teacher, he and
she were very dear friends.
President Cleveland does not suggest a
commutation, however, on the strength of
a feeling of friendship for bis mother
alone, but declares he has carefully in
quired into the past history of the con
demned and is convinced that he does not
possess a normal mind. Nor does the
President ask the Governor of the State of
California to issue the commutation, but
simply says he hopes he may see his way
clear to commute the sentence to life im
prisonment. '
Another letter which has been received
is from Collis P. Huntington, president
of the Southern Pacific Railroad. It is aa
follows:
23 Broad street, New York, Nov. 12,1896.
Bon. James H. Budd, Governor of the State of
California, Executive Mansion, Sacramento, Cal. â
Sir: This morning Frank Z. Wilcox, of Syra
cuse, in this State, tailed on me in behalt of
his broilier-in-law, Saner D. Worden, the man
convicted of train-wrecking near Sacramento,
and murder, upon whom the sentence of death
is to be carried out on the 18th prox. He asks
me to write to you and join in the petition for
commutation of Worden's sentence to impris
onment for life, ou the ground of the alleged
insanity and moral irresponsibility of the con
demned man. Mr. Wilcox orings letters to me
and petitions from the prominent citizens ot
byracuse. many of whom are well known to
me as beine among the best citizens of that
City, In support of his appeal.
I feel very sorry for the family of the con
victed man and especially so for those who
must for all of their lives suffer the unavoid
able stigma of his crime and his late, wnether
the latter be a disgraceful death or an almost
equally disgraceful life sentence, and if the
p. titions and allegations state the actual fact
with respect to the mental irresponsibility of
the criminal, of course Governor Budd will
need no further ground upon which to .bate
bis clemency la this unfortunate case. I
know nothing myself as to Worden's insanity,
but, as I wrote to a friend in California on this
subject some time ago, I have no personal
feeling in the matter. Assuming the man to
have been in the possession of his right mind
ana responsible for his actions at the time the
deed was committed by him, the only question
in my miud Is tbe safety oi society, wita
whom, in fact, the real question lies.
The legal taking of one man's life because2
he has illegally killed another does not help
the dead, but the intention and effect of it Is
to restrain others from committing a similar
crime, the doing of which they see entails a
similar penalty. This is the only reason why
I wonld have any man punished. 1 have
never known any individual who was entirely
good, nor found one who was thoroughly bad.
Men most generally are controlled by their en
vironments and the circumstances which sur
round them, and I believe that by kind and
thoughtful treatment Â»nd extending a help
ing hand to those who are morally Uecreuit,
almost any man can be brought on to a Higher
level and made to realize the enormity of
what he may have done, so as to be no longer
dangerous to the community at large.
I should favor, on the whole, the exercise of
< this clemency to Worden, believing that if
there is any real question of doubt as to his
condition of mind and mental capacity at the
time of the commission of the crime, he
tsbould by all means be given tbo benefit of
that doubt; and if this claim is not suffi
ciently established, I hope that the Governor,
in his wisdom and through bis knowledge of
ihe facts and nf the temper of tbe people, will
find it consistent with proper regard for the
safety of society to grant tue executive clem
ency asked for. Very truly,
C. P. Hcnti>gton.
In speaking on the subject Governor
Budd said to a Call representative to
day:
"I will grant a reprieve in this matter
simply because I deem it my duty to fully
ascertain whether baiter D. Worden is
rea.ly entitled to a commutation from
death to life imprisonment, owing to the
fact that he may bave been mentally irre
sponsible for his act in wrecking this train
and causing the loss of innocent lives.
"I shall appoint an agent in the East to
gather all the testimony procurable on tbe
subject from reputable people who knew
the condemned man during his life pre
vious to his coming to this State. I shall
procure al> the testimony possible in this
State, submit it to an expert commission,
and it that commission decides tbat Suiter
D. Worden is mentally irresponsible I
shall commute his sentence to life im
prisonment. If, on the other hand the
commission declares Baiter S. Worden to
have been in tbe full possession of his
reuses, not all the influence tbat can be
broueht to bear will save the man who
hurled innocent men into eternity with
out an instant's warning from expiating
that crime upon the gallows. If Wordeii
is declared sane be will hang.
"Again, I have prepared a bill, which
will be presented to the coming Legisla
ture, which will provide that any person
who has had his sentence commuted from
death to life imprisonment will not be
eligible to pardon unless bis petition for
sucb pardon be signed by the majority of
the members of the Supreme Court, and if
this bill be passed I will sign it."
CANADIANS PREPARE FOR WAR.
With the Assistance of Erg/and They Will
Be Able to Ho.d Their Own Against
Uncle Sam.
NEW YOKK. N. V., Nov. 20.â A Sun
Bpecial from Montreal says: The military
preparations going on here in Canada are
of a character to prove that England is
not making ready merely for the defense
of Canada against possible attacks by the
fleets or armies of any European power
or combination of powers. They are of
such a nature that it is every day more
evident that England is creating in Cana
da a great place of arms against the
American Republic.
So little attention is given by the Ameri
can press to Cauada and the inwardness
of the policy pursued by the party that
has been in power here for over thirty
years that it may come as a surprise
to them to learn that it is seriously be
lieved here that not only can Canada hold
her own against tne United States, with the
help of England, but that it is only a
question of time as to when a large part
of the New England States and a portion
of the State of New York will be asking
for admission into the Canadian confed
eration.
Re-enforcements for the regiments in
garrison at Halifax and Bermuda are on
their way out from England, which will
raise them to their full war strength. In
connection with the warlike preparations
England is making in Canada it is note
worthy that come of the papers that have
been most insulting in language toward
the United States now deprecate the idea
tbat there can be anything in tbe prepara
tions directed against them. They say
that tney ars only intended for a possible
war with Russia and France. What the
preparations going on for arming vessels
on tue upper lakes has to do with Russia
or France requires an imperialist mind to
discern.
According to a cablegram received here
the Pacific cable conference now silting in
London will no longer issue reports of its
proceedings. Tbe reason given for this is
the jealousy which the movement excites
in other countries, notably, says the cable
pram, in France and the United States.
The Canadian commissioners, it seems,
assured the conference that the idea tnat
has been entertained that the new Cana
dian Government was lukewarm toward
the scheme is an entire mistake; that on
the contrary they have definite instruc
tions to co-operate in the heartiest manner
"because of the high imperial ends to be
served by the cable.'-'
GENERAL MISSION WEDS.

FOR A SYMPA THETIC STRIKE.
Colorado Miners Preparing to Inaugu
rate a Big Walkout.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Nov. 20. â The
statement that the Governor has decided
to adopt rigorous measures to suppress
further violence at ths mines here and to
bring the strike to an end has, it is re
ported, caused the officers of the Miners'
Union, backed by the Western Federation
of Miners, to decide npon a plan to inaug
urate a sympathetic strike in all the active
mines of the State. Cripple Creek and
Teiluride are to lead and other unions will
follow in quick succession. It is said the
mine-owners of Montana have decided to
reduce the wa.es of their miners 50 cents a
day soon, which is expected to start a
striKe of the biggest union in the country.
It :s believed a sympathetic strike would
force the mine managers here to terms
with the strikeis.
Kentucky's 1011-iiate War.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. 20.â The toll
pate war in Franklin County is serious.
Hating torn away the toll-gates ot the
county, the raiders have turned their at
tention to punishing owners of turnpike
stock by destroying private property.
Three times in the past two days tele
phone connection between this city and
Farmdaie has been cut off. The last time
the wires were not only cut, but a mile and
a half of wire had been cut down and car
ried away. Mr. Farmer, the telephone
agent at Farmdaie. is a heavy owner of
tnrnpike stock, and the raiders evidently
believe that he is interested in the tele
phone.

ARE NOW ADMITTED

How His Company
Was Wrecked.
Rich Men Purloined the Stock

Sensatonal Revelations Made by the
Telephone Ma â¢?, Who C aims to
Be a Victim of Schemers-
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 20.â Edward M.
Harrison, the telephone inventor wbo was
made a defendant in the suit for a re
ceiver of the Harrison International Tele
phone Company brought by two stock
holdets in the Federal court, filed in court
to-day a long answer practically admitting
all the charges of fraud and wrecking and
saying that he was also a victim of the
schemes of President L. E. Ingalls and his
associates on the board of directors.
Among them are United States Senator
Elkins, ex-Secretary of the Treasury
Charles Foster, George R. Peck, general
counsel of the St. Paul railroad; Congress
man Warner, R. CL Kerens, Republican
National Commttteeman from Missouri,
and Patrick Egan, ex-Minister to Chile.
Harrison alleges that the company is in
solvent, its funds have been squandered
by officers and directors, who voted larce
salaries to themselves and money for
mythical expenses. He joins in the peti
tion to have the business wound up and
that the men who fraudulently secured
stock be ord red to pay for it.
He says all the assets have been ab
sorbed in the interests of the officers and
the stockholders defrauded. He asserts
that the contract of May 1 last was not
adopted at tbe annual meeting then trans
ferring the telephone pioperty to the
International Construction Company, and
he asks that it be set aside. The charge is
made that after his retirement from tbe
directory 45,000 shares of stock were ex
changed for 610 shares of construction
stocK, the latter being placed in tbe hands
of R. C. Kerens, PairicK Egan and C. M.
Ferree for the benefit of the telephone
company.
Harrison says the big men who were
made directors were to receive 2500 shares
at 20 cents a share for the use of their
names, as part of a scheme to entice the
public to invest in the $80,000,000 of capi
tal stock, but as soon as they were elected
directors they donated to themselves $2,
-000,000 each of the $50,000,000 stock and
voted stock to Ingails without consid
eration.
He states he was induced by false repre
sentations of Ferree and Sione, tbe pro
moters of the corporation, to transfer to
them a two-thirds interest in his patents,
and claims Ingalls was aware that the
patents were worth only $300,000 when tbe
company was incorporated with $80,000,000
capital on pretense tbat a lot of money
would be necessary to fight tbe Bell Com
pany, but really to delude the public into
believing that vast sums of money had
been invested by tbe directors.
The assertion is made that P. C. Han
ford, who was the Standard Oil repre
sentative in Chicago, killed himself when
he learned that he had invested $40,000 in
worthless shares of the company. Har
rison charges Inealls with falsifying the
minutes of the May annual meeting,
which he controlled by holding a big ma
jority of shares.
BATTERIES AND GEARCHLIGHIN.
Owners of the Isles of Shoals Group
Plan Fortifications.
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., Nov. 20.-
Leighiou Bros., who own the Isles of
Shoals group, have been in consultation
this week with United States engineers
with reference to establishing disappear
ing batteries on the Star and Appledore
islands. The Messrs. Laiehton are disin
clined to talk about the matter, but it is
known that plans for the batteries were
fully discussed, and their location, should
the engineers' report to the War Depart
ment be accepted, has been agreed upon.
It is intended that one of the batteries
shall be built on Star Island, on an ele
vation back of tbe hotel, in the vicinity of
tbe site of the John Smith monument.
No better location could be selected, as it
commands the approaches to tbe coast
from Cape Neddick to Ipswich Bay, as
well as ten miles of ocean front. The bat
tery on Appledore will be located near tbe
weutlier signal-station, on the southerly
front of the island. The fortification will
be circular in form and armed with two
ten-inch disappearing guns having a range
of twelve miles.
It in also designed to establish search
lights on the island, and thus render im
possible the efforts of hostile ships to run
by and land under cover of darkness.
BESIEGED BY WRITE RUFFIANS.
A Negro's House Burned and He Is
Also Sertously Wounded.
COLUMBU6, Miss.. Nov. 20.â An out
rageous crime was committed about five
miles north of this city Wednesday night,
when the house of Sanders Swarringen, a
peaceable negro, was surrounded by a
mob of white men, who set fire to the barn
where his cotton was stored and then fired
his house. In tbe meantime members of
the mob began shooting Swarringen, who
tried to defend himselt with a shotgun.
The gun failed to work, however, and
Swarringen ran to the house oi Thomas
Blewett, a white man, living near by.
Blewett's daughters were so frightened by
the shots and the sight of the fleeing negro
that they ran to the woods in their night
clothes.
Henry Fenderberg, bin son Charles and
son-in-law Seth Cule were the ringleaders
in tbe gang, and one of them is now in
jail here.' A party of citizens is in pur
suit of the rest of the tang.
Th#Â» reason the parties give for the at
tack is that the negro killed a dog belong
ing to one of Fenderberg's boys some time
ago. Swarringen will probably recover,
his wounds being of a serious though not
necessarily fatal nature.
IRRIGATION IN NEBRASKA.
Member* of the Convention Pleased With

GETS O NE HUNDRED DOLL A RS.
Small Amount Awarded a Widow on a
Big Life Insurance Policy.
NEW YORK, IT. V., Nov. 20.-The
fourth trial of the suit of Josephine Whit
laich against the New York Fidelity and
Casualty Company for the recovery of
$10,000, the amount of a policy on her hus
band's life, in the Supreme Court in
Brooklyn, yesterday resulted in a verdict
for the plaintiff ior $100 only. There was
a provision in the policy that it should be
void to the extent of $100 in case Whitiatch
sh ou (i commit suicide.
Whitiatch was a mining prospector and
was found dead in a hotel in San Francisco
a few years ago. There was a bullet in
his bead and a revolver by his side. The
question at issue at the various trials of
the case was as to whether he had com
mitted suicide, been murdered or killed
himself accidentally. Mrs. Whitiatch will
probably abandon the protracted litiea
tion, on which she has spent several thou
sand dollars.
Christian Temperance Women.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 20.â Tbe general
officers of tbe Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union were unable to riach a
decision to-day on the city in which the
next convention will be held, and it was
decided to defer the selection until the
officers held another meeting next Janu
ary. All the invitations were rejected ex
cept those of Detroit, Mich. During the
discussion Buffalo put in an invitation.
The cause of rejecting most of the invita
tions is that the officers thought it would
be wise to select some place near Toronto,
where the world's convention will be held
right after the National convention, thus
giving delegates an opportunity to attend
both gatherings.

BLUE AGAINST THE
ORANGE AND BLACK
Princeton and Yale Boys
Ready for the Big
Battle.
Will the Sons of Old Eli Beat
the Historic Students of
Nassau ?
Both Teams Ready to Put Up a Great
Game cf Football To-Day on
Manhattan Field.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 20.â With the
last finishing touches which were applied
this morning at New Haven and at
Princeton, the work of the great army of
coacbers and trainers is done, and the re
sult of the twenty-first annual struggle for
the football championship between the
elevens of Yale and Princeton lies in the
brawn and sinew of the men who will bear
tbe blue of old Eli aud the orange and
black of historic Nassau. Whether Yale's
winning streak of tbe past two years will
be added to to-morrow, or whether Prince
ton's eleven will score the lucky "odd
number," are the questions that are upper
most of thousands.
It has been more or less the custom
heretofore to prophesy on the morning of
the Yale-Princeton game that the crowd
would be greater than was ever seen at the
game before. Whatever the case in pre
vious years there is absolutely no doubt,
provided the weather is suitable, the at
tendance at Manhattan field to-morrow
will far surpass anything before recorded.
Both teams and substitutes arrived in
the city this evening. /; The Yale contin
gent are at the Plaza, as usual, and the
Tigers at the Murray Hill.
The followers of the orange and black
seem to think that the chances are in
their favor, and slight odds were obtain
able at the Stock Exchange to-day that
Princeton would win. But the bulk of the
betting was at even money, for while
Princeton's showinc through the season
entitled them to a degiee of favoritism,
the knowing ones kept in mind the well
remembered .New Haven, "hard-luck"
stories which have been always floated
before the eventful hour, but which some
how have, with just as much pertinacity,
failed to materially affect the playing of
old Eli's sons at the critical moment.
The gates will open at noon and play
will be called at 2 clock. Paul Dashiel
of Lehigh will again referee the contest.
The line-up will probably be as follows: .

MUST NOT OVERCHARGE.
Xaval Officers Try to Cinch the Govern-
ment on an Expense Bill.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 20.-The
Navy Department, iu order to deter officers
from overcharging their traveling ex
penses, has permitted to leak out a few
details of a small scandal tbat might have
led to a s rious court-martial.
. Upon the occasion of their recent return
from Nagasaki, Japan, to Seattle, Wash.,
two officers of the navy who had pur
chasÂ»d passage tickets at a reduced rate,
Â£25, the regular first-class price of a ticket
being Â£31, made claim for reimbursement
in the latter sum.
The matter was brought to tbe attention
of the department, and the officers have
been informed that they should have been
aware that by traveling expenses, tbe one
providing for mileage at 8 cents a mile
within the United States, whether it is
actually spent or not, and the other for
actual expenses outside tbe United States,
they could not be reimbursed for any
larger sum than that actually expended
by them. Bui inasmuch as it did not ap
pear that there was any intention on their
part to defraud, no lurcher action was
considered necessary,
MILLIONS ARE INVOLVED.
Ex- Governor Durkee's Executors and the
Suit Anainat the Government.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 20.â
Messrs. J. C. Biaisdell of Indianapolis and
J. A. Kuykendall of Sail Lake City are in

ecutor for the same. They are here on
business connected with a suit brought on

lions, and equals the entire subsidy of the
Union, Central and the other Pacific rail
roads, whose first mortgage bonds Gov
ernor Durkee came into possession of and
afterward assigned to the Government
for preservation and keeping until matur
ity foi the benefit of his heirs. These
bonds came to maturity in 1894.
Mr. Blaisdell explained to a reporter
that the suit was brought iv the Court of
Claims in May, 1893, and that what the
heirs wanted whs an accounting from tbe
Government, with leave to make applica
tion for a sinking fund in liquidation of
the first mortgage indebtedness of the
corporations, held to be a lien prior and
paramount to that of the United States.

Clews That Point to One or All of
the Quartet Now Held in
Custcdy.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 20.â Four
men with shady reputations are prisoners
at the police station on West One Hun
dred and Fifty-second street, suspected of
drugging and robbing Frank P. Arbuckle,
tbe prominent politician and minine man
of Denver, Colo., who was found dying at
Eighth avenue and One Hundred and
Fiity-second street early Thursday morn
ing.
They are George W. Stephens, a profes
sional gambler; James David son, a stenog
rapher; Fred K. Monger, a barkeeper,
and Samuel Stewart, a racetrack tout, ail
of this city.
The seeming clew to the murder points
to one or all of the quartet. One of the
men when confronted with the body made
a remark which threw suspicion upon the
others.
All four men are now in the custody of
the precinct commander in whose district
the dying man was found, and it is hoped
before another day cio.-es to have traced
Arbuckle's movements to the hour be was
discovered and removed to the hospital,
on the way to which he breathed his last.
Developments in the Arbuckle casn lead
to tbe belief that he was tbe victim of a
diabolical plot to rob him. It is now the
conviction of tbe police tbat Arbuckie was
lured uptown, drugged, robbed and then
left to die on tbe sidewalk in the unfre
quented region where he was found.
Frederick Menger, Joseph Davidson
and George W. Stevens, who were arrested
on suspicion that they were concerned
in the robbery and possible murder of
Arbuckle, were arraigned at tbe Harlem
oourt this morning, and at the request of
the detectives were remanded to give
further time for investigation.
Davidson, accordine to the police, met
Arbuckle at a saloon after having made
an arrangement with Menger and Stevens
to entice Arbuckle to some unfrequented
place and rob him. Davidson said he met
ArbacKle according to appointment and
introduced him to Menger, Stevens and a
man named Stewart, who is at large.
The police believe that Arbuckle was
first drugged and then placed in a cab
somewhere downtown and taken to Brad
burst avenue and One Hundred and Fifty
second street, robbed and then carried to
the sidewalk on Eighth avenue and left
to die. The best sleuths on the police
force are now engaged on the case and sur
prising developments may be made public
at any moment.

PUBLIC SPEAKERS BLUNDERS.
Joseph Matin, Point. Out Some Humor
ous Instances of the Fact.
Joseph Malms. himself a well-known
public speaker, gives the Woman's Signal
some amusing instances of the humors of
public speaking. It is, he thinks, a lack
of fluency that causes the speaker so often
to blunder. Mr. Malms has listened to a
temperance orator deploring the fact that
a triend resorts to "the frequent use of the
daily glass." He heard a notable lady
speaker speak of slum children "brought
into the world with no more idea of home
comfort than the children of negroes' in
Africa.".
One speaker said: "I rise emphatically,"
and another said, "I stand prostrate with
astonishment." Yet another feelingly
told his audience that it was '"not the
platform speaker, but the house-to-house
visitation, and the utterance of the silent
word by the caller, which did the most
good." "The statements that "the pre
vious speaker's suggestions were very sug
gestive," and that another speaker's re
marks were "miscalculated to mislead,"
Mr. Malms also mentions.
Then there is the speaker who always
misplaces his "H's," and who prays "that
we iuight be brought to the halter." There
was a flight of fancy when the speaket
asked. "Suppose if a modern balloon
dropped upon an uninhabited island
what would tbe natives say?" The scien
tific lecturer said of his coming experi
ment tnat "all depends upon tbe present
condition of the bo (y about to be created."
A town councilor spoke of "the rivers and
streams that abut on the borough boun
daries." Among Mr. Malms' other ex
amples is the speaker who began with
saying, "The proper study of mankind in
general is the â the study of mankind in
general," whereupon an urchin in the
audience cried out, "You're a-goin' in at
the same hole you came out at."
No less embarrassed was the old gentle
man wbo, stumbling through an after
dinner speech, said: â¢'! â I have no more
to say, and so â and soâ l'll make a few
more remarks." The builder frankly de
clared be was "more fitted for tbe scaf
fold than the platform." Sometimes the
chairman errs in welcoming the speaker.
A chairman was heard to welcome a
speaker as one "who is always with as,
and we wish he would come oftener."
Kind was tbe announcement that "there
will be two more opportunities to hear the
lecturer once more." It was when the
meeting: was ended that the chairman
asked the audience to "close by singing
just one verse of the Doxology."

SEATTLE, Wash.. Nov. 20.â Ten New
York Chinese passenger* on the Great
Northern train No. 3, tied up by washouts
between Wellington and Madison, arrived
in Seattle to-day. Through an interpreter
they said tnat while on the train they
were given two meals a day until at the
end of four days food supplies gave our.
The Chinese then walked seven miles
through the snow to a railroad section
house, where they were supplied three
meals a day. Making their way to the
connection road where it was in operation,
the Mongolians were taken over the Great
Northern back to Spofeane and tbence to
Tacoma on the Northern Pacific and to
this city via the iteamer Kingston. From
here they no to China via the steamship

Owing to the crippled condition of the
Great Northern and the Everett and
Monte Cristo railroads, there is liable to
be a serious famine in towns in thp Cas

City merchant, here to pu r chase supplies,
said that it has already begun. On this
subject the Times' Snobomish special says :
"The first party of 200 miners who left
Monte Cristo early in the week to walk
out to the lower town reached h.*re yester
day. The reason for this wholesale exodus
of miners is lack of provisions in the
mountain stores. Jb'rom reports of the
condition of the Everett and Monte Cristo
.Railroad it is evident that it will be three
weeks at least before they can get a train
to Monte Cristo. Superintendent Foster

out on the marsh to feed his slock. While
away the water got over the dykes and he
was unable to get back to the house. Tne

Lynn Relfe, formerly assistant secretary

is another first-class passenger who aban
doned the Great Northern passenger train
3on Saturday, after it pot stranded the
Friday previous between Madison and
Wellington. He made this statement to
nisrht concerning the affair:
"After stranding the train Conductor
Scoviile went to Wellington to look after
food supply. Soon after his arrival there
he sent back a telegram by messenger to
the train statins; that he had, while at
Wellington, received a dispatch announc
ing that it would be one week before the
train could be got out; that it was his
desire tuat the passengers come to Wel
lington and stop tnere at the railroad com
pany's expense. As Wellington is a small
town and provided with but lew accom
modations a number of passengers, my
self among them, concluded to take
chances on walking out and did so. There
were a number of ladies aboard the train
when we left."
For the first time since the disastrous

PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 20â A driving
snowstorm struck Portland this morning,
and it is snowing generally over the Wil

prevail off the coast. The snowfall is so
heavy in Montana that a blockade of trains
is feared. The regular train service has
been resumed on all the lines entering
Portland except the Southern Pacific.
The water is going down on their tracks.
The storm will cause great distresa in

FACTORY FOR STOCKTON.
Road Motors Operated by Gasoline Engines
Will Be Manufactured in That
City.
STOCKTON. Oal.. Not. 20.â 1t is pos
sible that a new - factory . may be built 'on
the north side of Stockton Channel, oppo
site the Crown Flour > Mill and a short dis
tance back from ; the water. The. site .is
. owned by the Holt ; Manufacturing Com
" pany and consists of four lots which
front on â¢ blind slough. In case the fac
tory is erected the] slough.will be dredged
and converted into a wide 'channel, so
boats can steam up to the factory d00r. %
A .year or more ago the Holts were
thinking of adding to their works on Sac
ramento and Church streets a department
for the manufacture of /bicycles; and one
of the brothers went East to inspect tne
bicycle factories there. rHe came \. back
w.tb tne announcement that the business,
if not overdone, was being handled so ex
tensively that a factory here would hardly
ray.-, The idea was abandoned, but since
then the company . has \ been experiment-^
ing on road motor* and ; has devised a car
nape which ,is propelled â '. by an engine
operated by gasoline. \-'i-- : -.i\. i \ 'i"-'.\':;'---;\~ '*â¢â 
Similar carriages are being used in Great
Britain and France, and as the business of
making them is increasing there, the Holt
brothers propose to commence the manu
facture of motors soon, so as to be the first
in that fieJd on this coast. ; â 
The first motors will probably, be turned
, out in 1 the works on Church and Sacra
mento streets, bat those- quarters T are
already so crowded that the firm quite re
cently built, a laree warehouse near by.
and is now putting up another building to
be used as a foundry. If the new indus
try proves a success, as they believe it will,
a separate factory for the manufacture of
motors will be erected on tie property on
the north side of Stockton Channel. A
small gasoline engine weighing only six
teen pounds and adapted to be attached to
the ordinary bicycle as a motor, will also
be manufactured by the firm.
FEAR HUNTINGTON'S POWER.
Los Angeles Citizens Aiarmed by His Ac-
tivity m Opposing the Free
Harbor Scheme.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 20.â N0
little apprehension has been caused among
the free barborites by the report from New
York that Collis P. Huntington has al
ready had an interview with the Harbor
Commission, which is to meet here next
month to decide whether $3,000,000 appro
priated by Congress for a deep-sea harbor
in Southern California shall b- expended
at San Pedro or Santa Monica. It is feared
that.Huntington, by thus taking time by
the forelock, may have created prejudice
in the minds of the commissioners in
favor of his pet project of having the Gov
ernment build a $3,000,000 breakwater to
protect his big wharf at Santa Monica. It
is feh, at any rale, that he has secured a
decided advantage by getting the first go
at the coiumissioners.
As the time for the convening of the
commission here draws near, the feeling
grows more ir.tense, and it is feared the
baules of the last few years will have to
be fought over. The Chamber of Com
merce has voted to place its rooms at the
disposal of the commissioners, and will
afford them every facility for gathering
data and information. T. E. Gibbon, the
attorney of tbe Terminal road, is busy
amassing information for tbe guidance of
the board. The representatives of the
Sana Monica interests are also at work.
Chief Engiiieer Hood of the Southern
Pacific is on the ground, and it is consid
ered quite probable that Huniington wili be
here also about the time the commission
ers assemble.
WAR ON SAN JOSE MEDICOS.
Secret Societies to Boycott Local Physicians
Because of a Dispute Over
Rates.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 20.â There are
prospects of war between the physicians
and secret societies of this city, owing to
to the refusal of the former to act as
special physicians for the societies at a
rate below that agreed upon by the Medi
cal Society.
It has been a custom with each society
to elect some physician who is a member
of the order as medical examiner, giving
him all the patronage of the society. The
rate has generally been fixed at a certain
amount for each examination â a per
capita for all the members of the order.
Several of the physicians did a great deal
of this work, but it cut 100 heavily into
the practice of the other doctors and at a
recent meeting of the medicos it was de
cided to abolish the custom.
This aroused the ire of the societies and
a movement has been set on foot to co
operate in bringing a physician from San
Francisco and giving "him tte entire
patronage of the members of tbe fraternal
societies and their families. The move
ment is said to have started in the Sons of
St. George. At a meeting of Garden City
Lodge, A. O. F., last night, F. \V. Hogan,
J. E. Ducoing and W. Gee were appointed
a committee to work with other lodges in
procuring such a physician.
GOVERNOR BUDD'S SCHEME.
Favors the Combining of San Quentin
and Folsom Frisons at the
Latter Place.
STOCKTON, Cal., Nov. 20.â 1t is ru
mored that Governor Budd has in view
some very important changes in the vari
ous State institutions, and that he will
recommend these changes strongly to the
attention of the coming Legislature. First
of these is the scheme mentioned in The
Call several weeks ago for the removal of
the feeble-minded from Glen Ellen to
Whittier and the Whittier inmates to
Glen Ellen, with the exception of the gin
inmates, who will probably be sent to the
Preston School. The- Gler Ellen institu
tion is surrounded by spacious grounds,
in which boy inmates can be constantly
employed and become in a mea ure self
sustaining. This cannot be <1 ne at
Whittier, as the area of the grounds is too
prescribed, and another reason is that
Glen Ellen is the beau-ideal location for
an institution of a penal nature, as owing
to the topography ol the surrounding
country the chances of escape from the
institution are greatly reduced. .
It is believed that the Governor will
â¢â trongly recommend the removal of San
Q jen tin prison to Folsom and the com
bining of the two institutions into one.
This will result in a great saving to the
State, and will insure the steady employ
ment of all convict wards of the State in
the inexhaustible granite quarries.

ROE WILL DIE
BY THE ROPE
Napa Jurors Convict Him of
the Murder of Mrs.
Greenwood.
Verdict Reached on the First
Ballot After a Brief
Deliberation.
"I Don't Care; I Am Satisfied," the
Assassin's Unconcerned
Comment.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 20.â William M. Roe,
alias William Moore, will die on tbe gal
lows. After a brief deliberation twelve
jurors this afternoon pronounced him
guilty of tbe murder of Mrs. John
Greenwood in tbis city in 189 L Tnere was
William M. Roe, alias Moore, Convicted at Napa of the Murder of
Mrs. John Q. Greenwood in JB9J.
no recommendation of mercy, and the
verdict means that society is soon to be
rid of a dangerous assassin, unless by the
process peculiar to California laâ the deal
ing of justice is delayed or finally defeated.
When the verdict was being announced
Roe gave no outward manifestation oi
that painful anxiety wbich would natur
ally possess a man whose life hinged on
the words that feil from the lips of the
foreman of the jury.
Carelessly resting his head upon his left
hand the prisoner listened to the jurors as
they were called. As "That is my verdict"
was answered by each of the twelve his
position did not change.
"1 don't care; 1 am satisfied," be re
marked unconcernedly as he was being
led back to his cell.
The jury had been out something over
an hour when the courthouse bell sounded,
which was the signal that the twelve
judges were ready to return to the court
room. The streets were soon filled with
men running toward the courthouse, and
within a few minutes the room was
crowded to overflowing. People had been
standing on tne streets in the vicinity of
courthouse for hours in order that they
might gain entrance to the courtroom.
Before the jury was brought in, the Judge
admonished the crowd to be quiet, what
ever the verdict might be.
The twelve jurors then slowly filed into
the courtroom. Although the room was
so crowded, there was nearly perfect
silence. It was almost taken for granted
that, as the jurors bad so quickly arrived
at a verdict, there could be no other find
ing than murder in the first degree. Clerk
N. W. Collins asked if a verdict bad been
agreed upon. Receiving an affirmative
answer he took from foreman W. H. Lake
the paper on which the verdict was writ
ten. After recording the verdict the clerk
read it aloud, asking if that was the ver
dict agreed upon. The verdict was,
"Guilty of murder in the first degree."
At the request of the attorneys for the de
fense the jury was polled. Each answered
iiiat that was his verdict.
By the consent of the attorneys next
Tuesday at 10 a. m. was the time fixed for
sentencing the murderer. Judge Murphy,
after thanking the jurors for their con
scientious performance of'auty, adjourned
court until that hour.
Most of the day was consumed by the
closing arguments of the attorneys. The
defendant appeared as little concerned as
the most disinterested spectator. When
damaging assertions were made he was
busily engaged in perusing tne San Fran
cisco morning papers.
"It is not my purpose," said District
Attorney Gesford, "to d scuss the testi
mony at length, for the evidence, it seems
to me, is most conclusive of the guilt of
the defendant. For years the officers have
sought the murderer of Mrs. J. Q. Green
wood. Gentleman of the jury, he has
been foun :. He is in this courtroom. I
don't say this because I have any animos
ity toward this man, but because I repre
sent the people, and this man is on trial.
One verdict and only one can be rendered,
and that is one of murder in the first de
gree."
Then followed an exhaustive review of
the testimony and a strong plea for the
administration of justice. Mr. Gesford
described minutely how Moore's steps
were traced on the Bth and 9th of Febru
ary, 1891, and told of the positive testi
mony of Stemmle, Mrs. Holland and Jacob
Shorer in identifying Moore as a man
("â en in Napa on the night of the murder.
He referred to the many times that Moore
has changed nis name, and paid that a
man with a character spotless, with a rep
utation unsullied, would not wish any
other name than that given by the father
and the mother; that only those persona
itahamed of their past life assume fictitious
names. With reference to the good char
acter of the defendant the attorney re
ferred to the good character that Theo
dore Durrant always sustained up to the
time of his committing that crime of
crimes iii the belfry of a ban Francisco
church.
"We have traced Moore while he was in
Napa on the 9th day of February, 1891,"
he continued. "Now let us examine his
movements while he was in the soutbern
portion of the State."
He spoke ot tbe confession made to
Mrs. Weys-e, savins that if tbe defendant
had wished to proclaim himself a whole
sale murderer he would not bave taken
Mrs. Weyse aside from all others and to a
private apartment and there made his
confession, but would have proclaimed it
broadcast. There were two classes oi per
sons that told the truth, he said, and
these were drunken persons and children.
Strong drink had often caused great suf
fering, but this was one of tne cases where
strong drink has been tbe means of bring
ing a criminal to justice. The facts stated
in the confessions were carefully compared
with the facts provert by the evidence.
Tue charge to the jury was made by
Judge Murphy, who spoke of the duties
devolving upon jurors; of the laws that
must be upheld and the nature of the laws
governing the case. The jury retired at
3:30 o'clock to consider the verdict.
WOODLAND CHILD MISSING.
Abducted bj If JUoth'r, Who Bad LoÂ»t
It in Dirorce Proceeding*.
WOODLAND, Cal., Nov. 20.â Quite a
sensation was created in this city to-day
by the announcement that Mrs. Hattie
Lowe, the divorced wife of Obe A. Lowe, a
wealthy farmer residing near here, had
disappeared, taking with her the six-year
ola daughter of the couple. Diligent
search has been made for the little one for
more than a week, but nothing has been
heard of her or her mother.
Wh<?n Mr. Lowe obtained the divorce
it was stipulated that the father should
have the custody of little Lucile, the only
child. It was further stipulated thnt
Hattie Lowe, thÂ« mother, could take the
child to live with her for a stated period
every year. A short time ago Mrs. Lowe
came up from San Francisco to visit her
mother, Mrs. George Eustice. She sent
for her child and the two remained at the
Eustice farm until November 10, when
they disappeared. None of the relatives
or friends have seen them. Mr. Lowe has
searched both this county and San
Francisco, but could obtain no trace of
them.
PASADENA MAIL THIEVES.
Fourteen Boxes on Street Corners Robbed
of Their Contents and
Destroyed.
JPABADENA, Cal., Nov. 20. â Mail
thieves made a raid on Pasadena last
night In the east and west sides of the
city the United States mail boxes were not
only pried open and titled of their contents,
but in many cases completely demolished,
and in some instances the wooden posts
supporting them were broken off close to
the ground. Fourteen boxes were looted.
All but one on South Orange Grove ave
nue, all on West California, atl on Lincoln
avenue and two on Grand avenue were
emptied. The remnants of four torn rain
soaked letters were all that were found.
The only trace of the robbers is revealed
by the report of a servant-girl, who was
aroused at 2 a. m near Marengo and Colo
rado streets. Looking from her window
she saw a man engaged in opening the
box there, while his companion held a
horse u itched to a buggy. Phillip Bach,
going home from night work about 2 a. m.,
also saw the men with the buggy.
The plumbing establishment of George
T. Downing was entered during the night
and $50 worth oi tools taken. With these,
it is believed, the work was done. The
boxes were opened with a cold chisel evi
dently and spit from end to end. It ia
not thought probable mat much of value
cou!d have been obtained. Under-Sberiffs
C ement and Marsh arrived from Los An
geles this afternoon anu are working on
the case.

THIS BURGLAR
WEARS SKIRTS
Santa Rosa Homes Looted
by a Tall Woman
in Black.
A Comely Prowier, Who Keeps
Housewives in a State
of Fear.
Makes a Business ot Entering Dwell
ings and Helping Herself
to Valuables.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. 20.â A pretty
female stalking abroad in the night, en
tering houses while their owners slept, ab
stracting valuables from their hiding
places and carrying them away 1 Really,
the new woman has come to Santa Rosa,
and she's the newest of them all.
For about two weeks there has been a
reign of terror among housewives, and
each morning brought the news of two or
three attempts at housebreaking during
the previous night. The operations of the
nocturnal visitor were somewhat peculiar,
and led the police to believe that it was
the work of an amateur, or at least a very
timid professional.
To-day two daylight raids were made,
each yielding a ?mall sum of money; and
a tall, handsome woman, dressed in black,
is known to be the thief. She was seen to
enter the residence of Herbert Moke and,
after remaining a few minutes, depart.
Mr.-. Moke heard some one about the
house, but believed it was her husband.
On being told of the visit of the woman in
black, sue at once looked to her stock of
valuables, only to find that her purse was
missing.
Mrs. William Morris received a call
from the tall woman this morning, and
while tbe servant girl went to inform her
mistress of the presence of a calier, the
stranger succeeded in abstracting the
Morris family purse and a few trinkets,
and made good her escape.
That ail the recent attempts at house
breaking are the work of the tall womaa
in black is now certain, and many timid
people here will sleep easier to-night after
hearing that the desperate burglar who
has caused them so much alarm is a hand
some woman.

BANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. 20.â Harry
Patterson, the young man arrested here
last evening on a charge of embezzlement
committed at Modesto, proves to have
been the right person, despite his loud
assertions of innocence.
Deputy Sheriff T. F. Kitrnan of Stan
islaus County arrived here tonight and as
soon as he laid eyes upon Patterson he
declared that no mistake had been made
and that he would soon land the smooth
youtig man where he could not sing in a
choir or borrow money from the members
of tha congregation. Patterson went by
the name of Harry Hardy while in Mo
desto and used the time-worn story of
"remittances from England" to obtain
money from various kind-hearted people.
While nere he rented a bicycle and tried
to give it to his landlady as security for a
board bill and in various ways attempted
to obtain money from members of the
Christian Courch, not excepting tbe pas
tor. Officer Kieruan will leave here with
hi* prisoner on the first train 10-morrow.
Aatoria's Oldest Pilot Head.
ASTORIA, Ob., Nov. 20.â Captain Phil
Johnson, the oldest of local river pilots,
and at present harbormaster of this port,
was examined to-day before the County
Court as to his mental condition and pro
nounced insane. For some time past bis
actions have been peculiar, and at times
of such a violent nature as to cause con
siderable alarm in his household. He has
imagined that some enemy was seeking
his life and fought one or two fanciful
battles recently with an ax for a weapon,
during which he worked himself into a
frei.zici state. Whether he wili be sent
to Salem or placed under the care of a
guardian has not yet been determined.
Captain Johnson is 76 years of age and
arrived in this city in 1848.

HILLS BO RD TRAIN-WRECKERS.
Attempt to Derail the California Over-
land and Hurl It From an
Embankment.
HILLSBORO, Ob., Nov. 20.â An st
tempt was mado to wreck the California
overland train last night. The keyboltof
a switch was broken and the switch set so
that the train going west would sidetrack,
but the train going East would pitch over
a high embankment
The westbound train was the first to ap- j
proach. The engineer was acquainted i
with tbe station and tbe sidetracks, so j
that when the locomotive took the siding j
he knew something was wrong and threw
his lever over. Tbe heavy passenger train
plunged on, but was under control and
stopped before the open switch at the west
end of the sidetrack was reached. A :
frightful accident would have resulted if '
the train had come from the other direc- :
tion and gone over tbe embankment.

tance from the earth, and they declare that
from their movement they must have been
attached to some air craft. They at one
time moved directly into the wind and
again started off at various tangents.
To-night's reports have as yet not been
verified, but that the mysterious lights <
repassed the city, going northeast, on
Wednesday night cannot be gainsaid,
and the belief grow* apace that some for
tunate mortal has solved the mystery of
aerial travel, has constructed his vessel in
some quiet spot and is making a thorough
test of its capacities before presenting it to
the view of an incredulous public.
PAISLEI BANDITS FATE.
Albert Wilson Sentenced to Three I ears
in the Penstentinry.
PORTLAND, Oe., Nov. 20.â Albert Wil
son, convicted of the robbery of the Pais
ley postoffice, was sentenced to three
years in the Oregon penitentiary and to
pay a fine of $1 by United States Judge
Bellinger this afternoon. Wilson's right
arm was paralyzed by the shot that
struck him when h? was wounded and
captured. When the Judge asked him if
he had any statement to make be said :
"You see, Judge, this is the first time
I've ever done anything of this kind, and
I promise it will be the last. I was 'broke,'
and the thoaght of my wife and children
is what caused me to do it. Let, me off
easy."
But the court was not impressed.
Salinas Hirjht of Way Suit.
SALINAS, Cal., Nov. 20.â Suit was
commenced to-day by the Southern Pa
cific Railroad against the heirs of the
Trescony estate to condemn land for right
of way. The suit is a friendly one, being
necessary because a number of the heirs
are minors. The purpose of the right of
way is to connect the Southern Pacific line
with the new sugar factory, so that the
material and machinery can be delivered.
The work of laying the track is to be
pushed us rapidly as possible, so that work
can be commenced on the new factory.
Bold Robbera at Tacoma.
TACOMA, Wash.. Nov. 20.â Two masked
men to-night held up George Stevens,
brother of Councilman Stevens, on Lower
Pacific avenue and robbed him of what
money he bad and his gold watch. They
marched him to Fransioii's feedstore and
covered S. H. Rockwell, one of the clerks,
commanding nim to open the safe. He
did not know the combination, so the rob
bers marched the two men to another
store, covered the proprietor and made
him open the safe. They secured $5 and
made off, leaving no clew.

STANFORD'S NEW
FOOTBALL YELL
Warlike Slogan Calculated
to Strike Terror to
Berkeley.
Enthusiasm Runs High at a
Student Rally Held in
the Chapel.
Varsity Team Men Leavj for the
Congress Springs Training
Quarters.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal,, Nov.
20. â Stanford students held a big football
rally in the chapel last evening, and for
two hours enthusiasm ran riot. The audi
torium was crowded to its fullest capacity,
and as each football man entered- he was
given an ovation, as were Coach Cross and
some of the 'faculty members, a large
number of whom were present.' All the
college yells were given,' the favorite being
a new yell, which is given very rapidly
and is most effective. It runs liKe this
Give 'em the ax ! the ax ! the ax !
Give 'em the ax! the ax ! the ax!
Uive 'em the ax ! Give 'em the ax !
Give 'em the ax!â Where?
Bight in the neck! the neck! neck !
Kijjht in tbe neck! tbe neck ! (lie neck !
Bight in the neck! Klgbt in tbe neck!
Right In the neck!â There!
The last words of each cry are greatly
prolonged, and as it is given by the Stan
ford crowd would do credit to a band of
blood-thirsty Apache warriors.
A speech was made by Professor Still
man, who said that he did not believe the
team could be beaten, but if it should be
the football men as well as the students
should prove that tney could bear them
selves as creditably in defeat as in victory.
He advised them to be philosophical in
the matter, to remember Berkeley's five
long years of hope deferred and let them
enjoy the victory if they won. /; .
â¢â¢However," continued the professor, "I
have every" confidence in our athletes and
believe that Berkeley's hope will of neces
sity be deferred at least one year more."
Then Coach Cross was called upon and
made a most enthusiastic speech that
brought him rounds of applause, and his
own Yale yell was given with a vim. He
said that if the men played the game of
which they were capable he had not the
slightest fear of the outcome. But every
man would have to do his best and every
student would have to lena his or her en-
courapement to the men to urge them on.
Captain Fickeri maintained, when called
upon, tbat it was a football man's busi
ness to play good, hard football rather
than to spend his time talking. He com
plimented the players on their conscien
tious training and expressed confidence
that they would work hard for victory.
He extended thanks to tbe ex-Str.nford
players who had returned to aid in the
coaching of the team and concluded hit
neat little talk with an expression of con
fidence that the team would triumph.
Stuart Cotton argued that it was no
longer a question of victory. The ques
tion of tne size of the score was ail that
he thought should worry the mind.
Among others who spoke was Archie Rice
of The Call, who is a Staniord graduate.
He gave the team advice from the stand
point of one who had seen both collegiate
teams in several games. Professors Wood
and Miller also addressed the students, as
did Football Manager Dave Brown.
Before adjourning it was decided that
the Stanford band should go to the game
in neat uniforms.
The football men, to the number ot
twenty-eight men, outside of the coacher,
left this morning for Congress Springs.
All but four or five were in good condi
tion, and these are expected to be in shape
in a day or two. The list of men was as
fellows: Captain Fickert, Seangiit, Dole,
Rice, Murphy, Cotton, Beckett, Freeman,
Parker, Carle, Harrington, Thomas, Jeffe,
Straight, Mclntosh, Burnett, B. Thomas,
Williams, McLÂ«me, Bigelow, Soper, Rob
inson, Adams, Daiey, R. Smitb, Fisher.
The bit; ' buses were driven around the
quadrangle with their loads ot Stanford's
brawny men and were cheered to the echo
by the students. It is not expected that
the men will return until after the big
game.
According to her usual custom Stanford
will send a band to the football game. A
large number of musicians entered with
the freshman class and after a semester's
hard practice a well-drilled band of iorty
pieces has been produced. F. D. Wills '98
has acted as leader this year in place of
Adolph Kaufman '97, leader on former oc
casions. The time of the latter has been
occupied in drilling the glee club. The
managers of the band are at present dis
cussing a proper uniform for the men.
Several advocate the adoption of a cap
and gown; others suggest a cardinal mor
tarboard, a dark-blue band coat with the
regulation cardinal braid, and white duck
trousers. The latter uniform will proba
bly be adopted as the rainy weather would
play sad havoc with colored gowns.
Stanford's Engineering Journal.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
20.â An engineering journal conducted by
the three engineering clubs here will prob
ably make its appearance early in Janu
ary. The magazine, if successful finan
cially, will be published at the close of
each semester. It has for its object the
presentation of the best reports delivered
before tne engineering students in the va

Santa Hnrfiara Water Suit.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Nov. 20.â A
case of more than local interest has been
on trial before a jury in the Superior Court
of ;his county for the last few days. It
involved riparian rights. Some time ago
H. S. Gould, a wealthy rancher of Monte
cito Valley, got out an injunction against
ex- Assemblyman J. S. Barker to prevent
him from using the water of Montecito
Creek. Barker, the present plaintiff, in
turn brought suit to compel Gould to
allow him the use of the water. The case
went to the jury late this evening, and
after five minutes' deliberation it returned
a verdict in favor of plaintiff.
Handkerchief* for Pauper*.
An important question has just come up
lor discussion at tbe Birmingham Board
of Guardians, and forms one of the burn
ing topics of the day. It is no less than
the provision of pocket-handkerchiefs for
the inmates. The guardian in favor of the
provision of these articles urged tbat
"primarily they must know that it was a
common thing to find a pauper with a nose
on his face, and that paupers occa
sionally suffered from colds." On inquiry
at tbe house be found that of twenty men
whom he saw only six could be said to
possess anything answering to a pocket
handkerchief. The largestof them would
not be above 6 inches square, while
others varied in shape down to one about
6 inches long and 1% inches wide. Another
guardian, in seconding, mentioned
that among the women in the aged
woman's ward he found only six
or seven handkerchiefs. The matter
has now been referred to a com
mittee, though a further question may
arise as to whether toe poor rate can be
used for the washing of the*e articles. The
discussion may open up a wide question as
to the average number of handkerchiefs
used by paupers in the United Kingdom,
or for* the matter of that by the worting
classes generally. It is certainly a point
for poor law reformers.â Westminster Ga

MARINES AT THE GUNS.
Hereafter the Corps Will Have In-
creased Duties Aboard Ship.
One of the most notewonhy features in
the naval regulations, as recently revised,
is a paragraph which directs the com
manding officers of vessels to assign ma
rines as a part of the regular forces lor
working the batteries.
It is understood* tbat this paragraph was
inserted in accordance with Secretary
Herbert's purpose to make this hereafter
the established policy of our navy, and of
his concision that the trial be lias made
of it for some months past has proved sat
isfactory.
Taken in connection with the increase
of the marine corps by 500 enlisted men
at the last session of Congress, to say
nothing ol the bills pending for the reor
ganization of the corps, it is clear that,
under the present administration, the
tendency will be to enlarge, rather than,
restrict, the duties of this portion of the
ship's company.
The contest on this question has been
prolonged, and there is no reason to sup
pose that it is yet entirely over, since
another Secretary might take a uiffertnt
view from Mr. Herbert's. But the in
crease of the corps as a result of the
recent legislation shows a belief on the
part of that body in its usefulness aboard
ship. This fact makes it highly probable
that tbe marine corps is destined to retain
its importance a: a part of the naval or
ganization.
The arguments of those who are for
withdrawing the marines altogether from
ships and assigning them to shore duty
only are that tbe sailors will be improved
in discipline and morale if they furnish
their own guard, and that with the re
striction upon the space aliowed for quar
ters in ships, and in the number oi men
that can be carried, every enlisted man
ought to be capable of performing all sorts
of duty. The marine, it is urged, is only
a sentry, and in such laborious duty as that
of coaling ship sometimes takes part in tne
hard work, wniie even privates of the ma
rine corps are excused from it lor the
purpose of standing guard over the blue
jackets. It is funner held that not only
would the available force for all sorts of
duty be increased by substituting sailors
for marines, but tbe sailors would have
more self-respect and the petty officers
would have a share in military and ship
discipline that properly belongs to them.
This view, in substance, was taken several
years ago by a naval board on the revision
of drill and tactics, of which Commodore
Greer was the senior member, the view of
that board being that the marines should
be entirely withdrawn irona the ships and
placed on shore duty.
However, the officers of the marine
corps, supported strongly by a portion of
the officers of the navy, suggested a differ
ent solution of the problem. Pointing
out that, from the foundation of the navy,
marines have played a most honorable
and useful part, that their organization
existed even through the Revolution
ary War. and that its services
have been praised by some of the
greatest of American sailors, they
urged that the true course is to increase
t!<e usefulness of marines aboard ship.
About two years ago Secretary Herbert,
in acting upon a petition of the petty
officers and men of one vessel, praying
that the marines should be withdrawn,
i ssued a circular saying that he was "con
vinced of the usefulness of that corps
both ashore and afloat and of the pro
priety of continuing it in service on ship
board."
In his last report the Secretary con
tinued his views in detail. He urged tbat
the modern steam vessel habitually re
mains longer in port than the old sailinz
vessel, and hence exercises its crew more
in landing parties and infantry drills.
Such drills and exercises with the ship's
battery take up more of the time of
the modern than the old tar, and
"it is precisely in infantry and gun
drills that the marine is or may
be an expert." Accordingly he considered
that marines were more properly a part of
the ship's crew now than of old, and that
marines ought to man a portion of tbe
guns as well as handle small arms, and
that their officers should, "subject to the
orders of the captain, command gun crews
and even gun divisions." He thought
that there would be a healthy spirit of
emulation between the sailors and the
marines.
Accordingly, he decided to put sixty
marines with two of their officers on the
Indiana, and other such lorces on tbe
other first-class battle-ship*. It has been
stated that one report made by the exec
utive officer of tho Indiana spoke of the
use of the marines as "a source of confu
sion and embarrassment." But that the
Navy Department did not regard the ex
periment as unsatisfactory is shown by
the fact that it makes the assignment of
marines to the working of euns a part of
the regulations as revised.
HERALDIC DECORATIONS.
Devices Which Appear in the Ornamen
tation of Public Buildings.
Without some knowledge of the science
of herald cy it is impossible to appreciate
the various devices which appear in the
ornamentation of many of our public
buildings and churches. Within the last
few years, in particular, Americans have
given closer attention to the dignity and
beauty of these stately edifices, and it
requires but a passing glance to acquaint
us with the part that heraldry plays in
their embellishment, says a writer m'Lip
piucott's.
The revived taste for the well-defined
styles of architecture of the medieval
period is apparent in all our larger cities;
tne introduction of the griffin, lion and
other heraldic figures is particularly no
ticeable. Take, for instance, the public
library of Boston, "built by tbe people and
dedicated to the advancement of learn
ing," in which heraldic decoration forms
one of the most important features. The
heraldic seals of the State, city and trus
tees are beautifully carved on panels
above the main entrance; the seals or
book-marks of tbe world's famous pub
lishers, beautifully carved, are a feature
of the exterior decoration, and eagles,
lions, the signs of the zodiac and other
symbols are exeouted in various parts of
the building with telling effect
The quaintly carved "lion and unicorn 1 '
upon the old Boston State-House speaks
plainly of British occupancy, and the
many coats-of-arms on old tombstones in
that city and vicinity cannot fail to im
press the observer. An especially rich
display of sculptured coats-of-arms is to
be seen upon the Gettysburg battlefield,
where costly monuments bear the arms of
the States by which they have been
erected in commemoration of the troops
who participated in that memorable con
flict.
Teapots were the invention either of the
Chinese or tne Indians, and are of uncer
tain antiquity. They came to iiuropewith
tea in 1610.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1896.
DIED DESTITUTE,
THOUGH RICH
Poverty Pursues a Portland
Child-Heiress to the
Grave.
Deserted by Her Father, She
Had Become an Object
of Charity.
Sufferings of One of the Rightful
Owners of the Large Gilman
Estate.
PORTLAND, Ob., Nov. 20.â Laura Mc-
Kinnie, a motherless little girl, 10 years
old, died very suddeuly in this city yes
terday, amonÂ» strangers, but not quite
friendless. Her death recalls the fact tbat
she was one of the heirs to the at one time
1500,000 Gilman estate. The little girl was
one of the grandchildren of the late Cap
tain James H. Gilman. who died some
years ago. Had she lived it is not at all
likely tbat she would have ever received
the legacy which her wealthy grandfather
intended that she should enjoy with her
brother. By the time the surviving chi!d
snail have attained his majority there will
not be much of the estate left to realize
upon, if things go as they have in the
past.
The whole story of the Gilman Iprtune
is one of wrongs and mismanagement;
and, basides, the "good times" when the
Gilman House for instance brougnt in
$800 a month are gone, and a half dozen
years after the owner has passed away the
estate is not worth $50,000. The lot of the
McKinnie children has not been a pleas
ant one, in the exchange of a once com
fortable home and luxuries for the public
charities.
After tbe death of Mrs. Ida McKinnie,
Oilman's daughter, McKinnie broke up
the household and boarded at different
places around town. The last place at
which he and his children were housed
was the Imperial Hotel. McKinnie could
never take care of money, especially
money that came from others for him to
spend. His children, the nurse and him
selt were turned out of tbe Irr.perial on
account of non-payment of a bill. After
ward the administrator paid part of this
bill.
McKinnie acted as guardian for bis
children. When money was turned over
to him to be expended for the benefit of
the boy and girl it was not certain what
became of it. The father evidently waa
not concerned about the welfare of his
children.
A little over a year ago McKinnie left
here and was supposed to nave gone to
Idaho. He was engaged in tbe insurance
soliciting business, and made money when
he cared to make the effort. He placed
Laura in St. Mary's Academy on Market
street and prouii-ed to pay for her tuition,
but the sisters never heard from McKin
nie again, and they nad to turn the child
out finally, because the pay for her tuition
and board was not forthcoming. The sis
ters have the bill yet.
The father took tbe boy, Gilman Mc-
Kinnie, with him, but what became of
either of them or where they are is a Ques
tion, as the present administrator of* the
estate, Cleveland Rockwell, holds no
correspondence with him.
DENTISTRY FOR MULES.
II Pay* Mining Corporation* to Look
After the Teeth of Their Animals.
It is not generally known tbat the large
mining corporations spend thousands of |
dollars annually in having veterinary den
tists examine and treat the teeth of the
much-maligned mine mule. Such is the
case, however, and it is safe to say that tbe
molars of these beasts of burden receive
far more care and attention than do the
teeth of many of the men and boys who
are their daily co-workers in the under
ground caverns. A weli-known Harrisburc
veterinary dentist who makes a specialty
of treating mules' teeth has more patients
awaiting their turn for his services than
perhaps any dentist in the State. At Dres
ent be is engaged in treating the teeth of
the 290 mules used in opeiating the col
lieries of the Philadelphia and Reading
Coal and Iron Company, which is only one
of a dozen similar big coal companies that
finds use for hfs services.
A vicious, stubborn mule, that snaps at
its driver, and kicks at the tantalizing
doorboys. several hundred feet beneath
the earth's surface, is neither an attractive
nor a doci.e patient, so tbat the occupa
tion of the veterinary dentist is not pleas
ant; but he has studied the peculiarities
and wicKedness of his long-eared patients,
and goes about his work, showing neither
fear nor favor, no matter now vicious his
patient may be. It frequently happens
that just as he has finished doctoring the
mule's teeth at a colliery, his patients are
so regretful over bis near departure that
they make frantic efforts to keep a moutb
iul of his person with them, or, failing in
this, they try to leave tbe imprint of one of
their sharp shoes on his anatomy as an
everlasting souvenir of their appreciation.
Th*> mule's stubbornness, bowever,is more
than offset by the dentist's grit and deter
mination, and he never passes a patient
until he has closely examined its mouth
air! treated all the teeth that are in need
of his attention.
A few days ago as the veterinary dentist
was completing his work at one of the
mines he turned his attention to a big
mule that is exceedingly vicious and sly,
and had jusÂ»l grasped the mule's tongue
in order to have a better view of the
teeth when the animal suddenly brought
bis teeth together with a snap over the
doctor's right hand, cutting the thumb to
tlie bone. Tne beast was emphatically re
buked for hm ungratefulness, the wounded
thumb was dressed, and before the mule
was set free it bad lost one of its offending
molars and several others were filed down
considerably. The dentist asserts that in
his entire experience that was the first
time that be had ever been bitten badly,
alt-ouch his patients frequently have the
satisfaction of sinking their teeth into the
folds of his heavy clothing.
The teeth of these mules, like those of
human beings, require some attention, al
though the former do not often decay, as
the food they masticate is neither rich nor
destructive. Besides nature has endowed
mules with a rough tongue that is an ex
cellent substitute for a tooth brush, and
which the beast whisks over and about his
teeth after be eats. One of his weak
nesses, though, is the habit of bolting his
tood, which frequently causes dyspepsia or
other diseases, such as affect humanity.
This bolting of hit food is not caused by a
desire to hasten his meal so that be can
hurry back to his work, but because his
molars or back teeth, with which he does
his grinding, naving more work to perform
than his front teeth, with which he nips
the pernicious doorboy and driver, wear
away in the course of a few years, and be
come much shorter than tbe front ones,
thus allowing the food to pass into the
stomach without being properly masti
cated. In cases of this kind, tbe incisors,
or front teeth, have to be filed down an
eighth or a quarter of an inch so toat they
are all uniform.
Filing the teeth is what the mule dis
fitces, and it is not much wonder, as be is
locked in stocks, his head lirnily secured,
and then while his toneue is pulled 10
one side the dentist wears the projecting
teeth down witn an instrument that has a
ereater rasp than a coarse file. A 9 soon
as a mule sees the dentist with his bright
steel instruments he seems to realize what
is in store for him and distends his nos
trils and eyes. He moans pitifully when
a tooth is being extracted and seems to be
happy when the diseased molar is drawn
out. At times, in showing his obj ctions
to the operator's heroic measures, the
mule jumps over the bars behind which
he is confined. The molars of a mule are
three and a half inches in length, while
the incisors measure two and' a half
inches, and judging from his signs of pain
the nerves are as plentiful and as sensitive
as are those of human beings.
An expert dentist operates on twenty
four ruules a day, and it is said that a
mule patient will remember the operation
as long as he lives. The extraction instru
ments are from two to three feet in length,
and the entire case of instruments weighs
fully sixty pounds. The teeth of the mine
mule are examined and treated, if neces
sary, once or twice a year, and as soon as
the dentist puts in his second appearance
at a mine his former patients become un
usually nervous and vicious. â Shamokin

THE RAT SEEMS TO LIKE HIM.
An Untamed Rodent's Sudden Attach-
nnMit for a Warehouse Porter.
George Wilson, a colored porter of Vir
ginian birth, who works for T. Sisson &
Co., is the object of the singular affection
of a rat. About two weeks ago he caught
a large gray rat in a wire trap in the store
house and called on one of the firm to see
his catch. The subject of disposing of the
rat by poison, drowning or by the aid of a
rat-terrier dog was discussed, and pending
a decision of the question Wilson fed the
rat in the cage for a day and then let the
rodent co.
To his surprise the rat returned to the
trap the next night, and waa found the
following morning awaiting Georee's
visit with manifestations of pleasure. He
was fed again, and exhibited his appro
bation of his colored preserver's kindness
by rubbing his head along the bars, licking
Wilson's finger, and acting much as a cat
does when purring forth her affection.
Wilson stroked the rat throurh the bars
of its prison, gave it more food, and let it
go again. It appreciates the kindness
bestowed upon it by returning nightiy to
its cage to be fed. A singular fact is that
the rat calmly ignores the presence of any
one else, and will only arouse itself and
show delight when Wilson approaches.
The rat's colored friend has as yet made
no attempt to handle it for training pur
poses, but it shows genuine pleasure when
he is around, and yesterday played about
the storehouse while he was at work. After
being released, tbe rat usually climbs the
wall and passes through a convenient hole
into a room above. The life of that rat is
not likely to be shortened through its
singular attachment to its benefactor.
Other dumb animals seem to be favora
bly affected by Wilson's presence. John
J. Nairn, the accountant of the firm, owns
a gray riding horse, which he uses daily.
The men at the stable where tbe horse is
kept are a little afraid of it, and are espe
cially careful bow they approach its two
extremities, as it is rather viciously in
clined at both ends. It is not so, however,
when Wilson is around Mr. Nairn, when
he comes down in the morning, dismounts,
and, calling to Wilson, takes off the horse's
bridle, and tbe animal follows the Colored
man anywhere, and he is perfectly docile
in his presence. Perhaps one secret of
Wilson's influence over dumb animals is
his uniform good nature and kindly dis
position. You can read tbete qualities in
Wilson's face, and he is a genuine good
natured, kindly Virginia darky, one of the
best of his type. â Hartford Courant.
HIS LAST OFFICIAL ACT.
Xapoleon Intrant oil the Kmpreag and
His Son to the National Guard.
Next day Napoleon performed his last
official act, which was one of great cour
age botn physical and moral. The Na
tional Guard in Paris had been reorgan
ized, but its officers had never been thor
oughly loyal to the empire, many of
them being royalists, and some radical
republicans. Their dissatisfaction had
been heightened by recent events, but they
were nevertheless summoned to the
Tuileries; the ri-k was doubled by the
fact tbat they came armed. Drawn up in
the great chamber known as tbat of tbe
the marshals, tiiey stood expectant; the
great doors were thrown open, and there
entered the Emperor, accompanied by his
consort and their child in tbe arms of
nis governess, Mrae. de Montesquieu.
Napoleon announced simply that he was
about to put himself at the head of his
army, hoping, by the aid of God and the
valor of his troops, to drive the enemy be
yond the frontiers. There # was silence.
Then taking in one land that of the Em
press, and leading forward his child by
the other, he continued: "I intrust the
Empress and the King of Rome to the
courage of the national guard." Still
silence. After a moment, with suppressed
emotion, be concluded: "My wife and my
son." No generous-hearted Frenchman
could withstand such an appeal. Breaking
ranks by a spontaneous impulse, tiie
officers started forward in a mass, and
shook the very walls with theircry, "Long
live the Emperor!" Many shed tears as
they withdrew in respectful silence, and
that night, Â»on the eve of his departure,
the Emperor received a numerously signed
address from the very men whose loyalty
be had hitherto had just reason to sus
pect.â"Life of Napoleon," by Professor
Sloaue, in the August Century.

WEDDED AT LAST
A Postponed Ceremony Crowned
With Much Joy and More
Feasting.
TRUTH BELITTLES FICTION
Weeping; Bridesmaids and a De
mented Bride Made Very
Happy.
"The gentleman who arose in his place
last week and was rude enough to remark
that California has no choice sensations
will oblige me by paying his dues andâ
withdrawing from the club," remarked a
man with a face full of humor who pre
sides over a coterie of "Good Fellows"
who meet once a week to gossipâ and
smoke.
"What's the latest, Jim?" queries a
man who smells in tne atmosphere a good
"spicy" story.
"Now, boys, this must be on the dead
est kind of a dead level," muses the story
teller. "I would sooner eat my hat than
tliat this should get out, but it's gospel,
and the only excuse for telling it is that it
is about a fellow we used to chaff about
getting married."
Secrecy was sworn to all round, but, as
usual, "somebody leaked." It is "always
thusly."
But to return. A prominent member of
the club had been attached to a highly
respected girl for more than a yeai\ At
times it was noised about that they were
to be married, and then in a month or
two the wedding was "not going to come
off," as the society reporters put it A
vaeue suspicion arose that the gentleman
wa3 trifl.ng with the affections of the girl,
and war was threatened on more than one
side. But the wedding day was eventually
announced. Ushers were chosen alto
gether apart from this coterie of his old
friends, ana it was said that the prospec
tive bride had willed it so. Every one
who knew him thought tbat to marry was
a good safe thing for him to do, for, as a
result of thoughtless lolly, be had become
nervous, down-hearted and "blue," but
as the girl was evidently fond of him, and
at the same time sensible and good
hearted, it promised to be more than "a
hapuy match." The day came, the brides
maids were in charming toilettes, the bride
was expectant, and the priest asreauy and
willing as is usual on such occasions. But
the groom came not. A messenger found
that he had left the house ail ready for tbe
ceremony, and his absence became a mat
ter for comment which was scarcely favor
able.
It seems that he had bad a feeling as
though he was not (juite fit for the married
state, and he put off from day to day the
matter of going to ask tome one who could
tell him the truth about tne matter. But
at the very last moment his courage failed
him. He decided to be driven to the
great Hudson Medical Institute, at the
junction of Market, Stockton and Ellis
streets, and to get advice before going to
the altar. With characteristic truth and
no flurry he was told there by one of the
senior physicians that in justice to his
prospective bride he should put off the
ceremony for a time. He went out and
sent a message, but he could not bring his
poor brains to word it. It merely said:
Minnieâ Cannot come; iiek. Please post
pone ceremony.
Now, nine women out of ten would have
been discus ed as well as disappointed,
but sue simply had a plain case oi hysier
ics; her four bridesmaids wept copiously;
and tne wedding party adjourned.
Ten days asro that little party reconvened.
One wnole man was made happy: one
good girl became a wife; the dinner which
followed was a pleasant episode for every
one; the bail which followed that was
sweet enough to atone for an earlier dis
appointmentâso said the bridesmaidsâ
and a tale of truth which seems improba
ble on its face has got into print.
"I will swear," said the happy bride
groom (if you won't print my name, of
course) tbere is nothing good enough for
me to say about how I was pulled out of
this hole."
But even then he did not say that
"Hudyan" â the splendid renn-dio-treat
ment for all nervous disorders intro
duced by the doctors of the Hudson
Medical Institute had cured him.
How was it discovered ? Why the
president of his social club, seeing how ill
he was, had written to the Hudson Medi
cal Institute and asked them to mail soma
circu ars about theÂ» great "Hudyan" to
this poor fellow. And strangely enough
he dropped a "Hudyan" circular at tne
altar when he was eventually married.
Of course the physicians at the Institute
decline to discuss the case. They always
do, but truth will out.
"Hudyan" has cured thousands of peo
ple of all classes of disease unquestionably,
but is it to become immortal? Time will
tell.

HOW SCIENCE IS ASSAILING TUBERCULOSIS
Dr. Maragliano's Famous
Serum Is Being Tried
Here.
â  Drs. De Vecchi and Vaccari
Discuss This Cure for
Tuberculosis.
Physicians and Veterinary Surgeons
Supervise the Bacilli-Destroy
ing Fluid.
The exposition of Dr. Hirschfelder's
antitoxin treatment, as discussed in the
. columns of The Call, has been the all
absorbing subject in the world of science
and of the public at large as well.
While the local physician's remedy is
being discussed medical interest centers
round several tubercular cases that are
being treated by the Maragliano serum.
In France, England and Italy this
serum is being employed with remarkable
' results.
Maragliano is s professor in the medi
cal college at Genoa and has long enjoyed
the esteem of the entire medical world.
His antitoxin is now being used
throughout the hospitals of Italy, and the
manufacture of the serum is under gov
ernment control.
The Maragliano antitoxin is a horse
, â¢ serum, prodnced by inoculating healthy
animals with cultured human tubercu
losis.
â¢ - The process of manufacture is under the
immediate supervision of physicians and
, veterinary surgeons, and the clinic his
tory of the inoculated animals is kept
with all the exactitude devoted to a regu
lar patient.
For the past few months Dr. Vaccari
has been using the Maragliano serum
with marked success and is most enthusi
astic in support of the treatment.
"The treatment is simple." said Dr.
Vaccari, "and in early stages of consump
tion there can be no doubt of its efficacy.
Although the beneficial results of the
serum is immediate, fully two months
'must elapse before any definite result is
noticeable in the improvement of the
â¢ living tissue. isut once an improvement
is noticeable there is no backsliding of the
disease. The patient continues to get
â¢â â¢ better and better. According to Marag
liano one year of treatmentâ for the first
two months an injection of the serum
.' every other day, then allowing more and
. more time to elapse between treatment â
. is the prescribed tonic for complete resti
tution to health."
When seen in regard to the new remedy
for the cure of the dreaded tuberculosis.
Dr. de Vecchi expressed himself in favor
of -the Maraglinno serum.
"Dr. Maragliano," said the local physi
cian, "first presented, at the medical con
gress convened at Bordeaux a year ago
last August, his new method for the treat
ment of tuberculosis, backing bis tdeorv
with forty-three cases that had favorably
progressed under his treatment.
"His lecture at the congress was received
' with unusual favor, considering be was a
stranger and the chauvinism of the French
is proverbial.
"Shortly after he addressed the medi
cal society of .London. This lecture was
received with great favor, after a long and
warm discussion.
"This same immediate acquiescence did
not greet the professor in Italy â 'Nemo
profeta in patria.' Maraeliano's method
' was bitterly opposed at the medical con
grets at Rome, especially by tne bacteri-
o logists, whose enmity and bitterness he
'â¢ had aroused by not publishing, as he had
promised, bis formula for the preparation
of his serum.
"He bad broken his promise to his pro
â . fessional brethren for the reason that the
' extreme caution necessary in the prepara
tion of the serum made it dangerous to
spread the formula broadcast.
"The composition of the serum is now
public property, and the scientific world
of all Europe has been quick to adopt the
treatment.
"The process employed in the manufac
ture of the serum is not a simple one. It
is prepared in a special laboratory under
the control of the Government and under
the immediate supervision of a board of
rfbysicians and veterinary surgeons. whose
especial mission ie the selection of ani
â  main and keeping them under the careful
â¢ 'observation necessary for the inoculation
and immunization.
"The serum is then prepared, and when
the necessary tests have been made it is
sealed in small bottles for exportation.
. What to me is one of the most convincing
features of the serum is that Marag
liano introduced his method only
"' after experiments conclusive and bene
ficial, convincing not only himself but
those most bitterly opposed to his treat
ment.
i "Last April the doctor had the pleasure
V of publishing his 400 cases, all attested to
by the best medical authorities of bis
country.
( "Since then," concluded Dr. de Vecchi,
the treatment has spread so rapidly and
the attending success is so marked that
cases are published by the thousand.

The Board of Health Will
Provide for Examin
ations.
Suspected Cases of Consumption
to Be Tested by the Bac
teriologist
By This Means the Disease May B2
A most Wholly Exterminated
in Time.
San Francisco will have its station for
the examination of all suspected cases of
consumption, so the Board of Health is
abreast of the most advanced thought of
the times in the treatment of disease.
Two days ago Dr. J. 0. Hirfchfelder
stated that he believed consumption could
be eradicated in a few generations by a
| system of examinations of all persons
afflicted with "consumptive" coughs or
suspected of having consumption. This
opinion is the result of his observations
of the oxytoxin treatment discovered by
hi in -elf, which has cured cases of con
sumption in its earlier stages. Yesterday
another physician, who has given the
matter considerable study, supported him
{ in this statement, and other doctors said
it was possible to eventually eradioate
tuberculosis. However, they wanted to
see local Boards of Health take up the
subject and establish such stations rather
than wait for Government aid, which
is slow in coming. Dr. Farnum stated
that the City Board of Health should es
tablish a bacteriological station to con
duct such investigations. "My opinion
is,'' he said, "that the Supervisors here
ought to provide funds for public bacte- '
riologists to examine free of charge all
specimens of Eputum and other speci
mens which physicians may take to
them for examination. This would aid
very much in making an early diagnosis
and stop the spread of such diseases as
tuberculosis.
"The Board of Health has already made
provisions for a rjubiic bacteriologist and
appointed Dr. Spencer to that office. At
present hi} laboratory is being fitted up
at the City Hal), and within a brief period
he will be at work with an assistant. The
original intention was to confine the work
to diphtheria and typhoid fever, as in
New York, where there are many stations
in that city where physicians can obtain
gratis a culture tube and a sterilizing swab
for diphtheria tests. As soon as a physi
cian is called to a case suspected to be
diphtheria he sends to ti>e nearest statior
for such a set, he introduces the swab into
the patient's throat, ruba it over the inte
rior of the culture tube and then returns
the set to the station. This tube is imme
diately sent to the Health Office labora
tory, where it is placed in a culture oven
and an investigation of the germs is made.
Within twenty-four to forty-eight hours
the physician receives a report whether
the case in one of true diphtheria or not.
"By this means many cases of throat
disorders, otherwise mistaken for diph
theria, are correctly diagnosed and the
family is saved the annoyance, if not the
injustice, of being quarantined. Besides,
if the disease be diphtheria, it is known
next day and the physician can treat it
intelligently."
Dr. Henry H. Hart of the Board of
Health said yesterday that he believed
this department should be general in its
work and include consumption cases.
"I believe that ihe Board of Health es
tablished the laboratory for the benefit of
people afflicted with any disease. Surely
it cannot be for diphtheria alone," be said.
''We cannot ignore a disease which in my
opinion kills a hundred times more peo
ple. I mean tuberculosis.
"Why should the Board of Health neg
lect a disease that would affect genera
tions? Why object to having the sputum
examined in the public bacteriological
laboratory? That institution is for the
benefit of the people, for the public good,
from the fact that it is their money which
maintains it. I think there will be one or
more assistants to Dr. Spencer. Of course,
it is still in its infancy, but as time pro
gresses, gradually it will reach larÂ«e pro
| portions.
"As this Board of Health took the ini
tiative in testing milk and cows, other
cities in California followed its example.
So I should think they would also estab
lish bacteriological stations patterned
after ours. More cood will be done this
way than by waiting for tne General Gov
ernment to move. I feel satisfied that if
the Supervisors are convinced that such
an institution is ior the good of the public
health they will gladly make the neces
sary appropriations for conducting bac
teriological examinations on a scale to
meet the demand upon the physicians in
cnarae."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1896.
JACK AND JIM
FOUGHT TAMELY
A Boxing Match That Ap
peared to Be Pre
arranged.
The Men Talked While in
Clinches and Made Very
Wiid Swings.
Finnick Was No Match for Hawkins
and the Bout Was Quickly
Stopped.
A more disgusted crowd than that which
left Woodward's Pavilion last evening
would be hard to find.
The announcement that the two clever
pugilists, Jimmy Carroll and Jack Mc-
Auliffe would meet in a ten-iound contest
was sufficient to nack the pavilion with an
immense gathering of people who delight
in witnessing a good pugilistic encounter,
but they were sadly disappointed on this
occasion.
The St. George's Club, under whose aus
pices the fistic entertainment took place,
may be free from censure, but judging
from the way the pugilists acted while
"fighting" within the ropes spectators be
lieve that they had had an understandine,
and whatever arrangement they may have
agreed upon to hoodwink the public they
carried out to the strict letter.
The sport-loving public of this City
will put up with some abuse, but when
those who pay a good price to witness a
fistic contest on merits meet with such a
disappointment as 111 1 at of last evening
they will do with pugilism as they nave
done with baseball, viz.: leave it severely
alone to die the death it deserves.
There can be no such thing as gainsay
ing the fact that the ten-rounfi contest
between McAuliffe and Carroll was rank
and thoroughly disgusting to all but those
who won money on McAuliffe. With the
exception of a wild-eyed rally that ensued
in the first round the contest was the
poorest in every respect that has been
witnessed in this City for many years. If
the St. George's Club desires to place itself
on a poo l footing before the athletic
public it should teach hippodromers a
lesson by refusing to give them a cent.
The opening contest, which was to be a
ten-round bout between Dai Hawkins and
Harry Finnick, terminated also in a dis
mal failure. Finnick proved to be a "dub"
oi the first water, who could not even
fiiard his face from any point of attack.
George Green, who acted as referee, grew
thoroughly disgusted with the manner in
which the contest progressed and received
the congratulations of all present when he
stopped the contest in the middle of the!
second round, seeing that Finnick was but
a chopping-block for Hawkins.
Tne general opinion was that Finnick
never whipped any man of note in his
life. He proved to be a very raw recruit
before the clever Hawkins.
At 8:45 Harry Finuick and Dal Haw
kins entered the ring with their respective
seconds. Hawkins was esquired by
McAuliffe Ducks Easily From a. Rigfht-Hand Smash at His Chin.
"Spider" Kellv and R. Ross and Finnick
was seconded by Stenzler and Whelan
Billy Jordan, who performed the duties
of master of ceremonies, announced that
the pugilists would box ten rounds and
that a decision would be rendered. The
referee selected was George Green. Bet
ting was $10 to $8 in favor of Hawkins.
First roundâ Hawkins was first to land a
Btmighi left on Finnick's face. Some fiddling
and Hawkins landed again. Hawkins hit
Finnick with right on neck and brought Fin
nick down. In a few seconds afterward
Hawkins Bent his opponent down agfiin. In
fact the Californian had everything hs own
way, and played with Finnick aa a cat would
play with a mouse. Finnick looked like a
dub,
Second roundâ Hawkins kept his left play
ing on Finnick'B wind and face and aftei a
moment of stand-off fighting dashed into the
Kid and drove him about the ring with
straight rights and lefts. Finnick could
neither stop nor return the rain of blows that
landed on his neck and ribs, and within a half
minute was groggy and at Hawkins' raercv
He swung wildly occasionally in an effort to
reÃch Hawkins' ribs, but his blows were wenk
and short and he took to clinching to avoid
punishment.
After ninety seconds of fighting the
crowd benan yelling, "Stop it! Tako him
out!" and Referee Green acted on the sug
gestion and sent the men out of the ring
declaring Hawkins the winner.
Finnick could hardly have lasted an
other round, and was rated the worst
"dub" that nas been seen in a local ring in
a long time.
No one who saw the so-called fieht be
lieved that Finnick ever whipped Van
Heest or Billy Murphy, and the opinion
was freely expressed that club managers
should not only verify the records claimed
by fighters but try them out before match
ing them.
There was great cheering when the two
crack pugilists, James Fleming Carroll of
England and late boxing instructor of St.
Georee's Club of this City and Jack Mc-
Amiffe of Cork, Ireland, put in an appear
ance. Neither of the pugilists bcaled
within the lightweight limit. In fact
they bad all the appearance of welter
weights. Carroll looked perfect in condi
tion, but McAuliffe could very easily have
disposed of several pounds of good flabby
flesh, which loomed up like a mountain of
fat over the belt that encircled his
stomach.
Carroll was looked after by Barnett,
Wheelan and Sielzner, and McAuliffe was
seconded by Frank Allen and Jimmy
Farrelly, witb Barney Farley close up.
Billy Armstrong of this City was selected
by tne club and the contestentÃ to referee
the match. McAuliffe wore bine trunks
and Carroll red trunks. It was 9:45 o'clock
when the referee called the pugilists to
the scratch and had a little talk regarding
break-aways, etc., etc.
First roundâ The men ran to the middle of
the ring and without more than a few seconds'
preliminary sparring went to work. McAuliffe
missed two left leads at the head and was
countered lightly on the nose. Carroll ducked
under the champion's swings and kepi away
until toward the close oi the round, when he
went in and scored twice lightly on Jack's
luce. Both showed the effect oi the speed
toward the end, when McAuiiffe began forcing
matters and lauded with open gleve on
Jimmy's ribs with his right.
Second roundâ Carroll toed the scratch with
bellows to mend, and McAuliffe was first to
land a aice tap on Jimmy's neck. Carroll re
taliated, and his good right shot harmlessly
over McAullffe's snoulder. This was followed
by a clinch and a short chat which euded with
a smile.
Third roundâ Both men were seemingly
tired and gpurred for wind. MeAuliffe forced
Jimmy iuto a corner and let go his right, but
it failed to connect, and Jimmy came back
with a couple ot straight lefts thai sent the
champion's head back. Jack's right was evi
dently ready for business and it landed fre
quently on Jimmy's ribs.
The crowd was getting impatient and
yelling, "Fight, tight 1"
Both swung wild and then fell to clinching
to gain time. *
Fourth roundâ McAuliffe stepped quickly to
the center of the ring and smiled at his op
ponent, who smiled in return. A short ex
change of pleasantries, and McAuliffe sent
homo a light tap on Carroll's jaw. Somebody
shouted to Carroll that McAuliffe had a good
looking stomach that required punching; but
Carroll evidently did not heed the suggestion,
as he made no attempt to disturb Jack's lager
tank. Some fiddling, short spells of talking
and a brisk rally at close range ended the
bout.
Filth roundâ This was very tame, McAuliffe
forcing Carroll into the latter's corner and
then letting him out without a blow. His left
swings were remarkably slow, and Carroll
easily ducked away from them.
Sixth roundâ This was very tame. The pugi
lists were puffing, and the blows they struck
went harmlessly over their heaas. Not a drop
of blood was seen up to this time. McAuliffe
took a goud big drink of whisky at the end of
tills round.
Seventh roundâ They exchanged lefts and
then mixed it a little, but evidently were not
hurt by the weak blows that landed. Jimmy
uppercut Jack in a breakaway and was sent
groggy by a couple of righis that connected
with his neck.
Eighth roundâ This was the only exciting
round of the mUI. McAuliffe had taken a
big swig of Barney Farley's potheen, and he
rushed at Jimmy who, in the attempt to avoid
a collision, tripped and fell. When Carroll
regained his pins he rushed at McAuliffe and
they engaged iv a harmless exchange of biowg
at close range, but nobody was carried off the
field.
Ninth roundâ McAuiiffe, after another pull
at the flask, went jauntily into Carroll's cor
ner and sent in a left that made m led patch
on Jimmy's ribs. Carroll landed two left
facers in return and then both swung wildly
and without the slightest precision. Both
were pumped out, and >he blows they ex
changed with the right just before the bell
lacked steam. McAuliffe had several chances
at Jimmy's neck, but let them pass without an
effort to land and kept banging away with
gentle swings at his opponent's ribs. The
round closed very tamely.
Tenth roundâ Everybody expected to see the
fighters get in and mix things. They d;d
make something of an effort to please the
spectators, but the blows they struck would
not hurt big Joe McAuliffe.
When the beli sounded Jack and Jim
were in each other's embrace and smiling
at each other. The referee, when he had
an opportunity to be heard said that he
bad a reputation at stake and that as Me-
Auliffe had done the better fighting he
must give him the decision. According to
the conditions entered into by the
fighters McAuliffe is to receive 75 per cent
and Carroll 25 percent, which is the easiest
money ever earned by pugilists.
A stalwart Deputy Sheriff who was in
the audience carried a garnishment
against Jack McAuliffe 9 end of the purse,
but it was not served. When McAuliffe
was In this City a couple of years ago he
borrowed several hundred dollars from
Mose Gunst and the Police Commissioner
took out tne garnishment, which was di
rected to J. D. Gibbs. It was supposed
that Gibbs had the control of the club
and, consequently, the receipts, but when
the paper was presented it was found that
the whole matter had been turned over to
Harry Corbett and, consequently, the gar
nishment could not be served.

DEFEAT FOR CREDITORS OF
THIS CITY IN THE COURTS
They Cannot Recover for Supplies When the Fund
Appropriated for the Fiscal Year Has
Been Expended.
The Supreme Court Decides in
Favor of the Super
visors
IN THE SUIT OF GOLDSMITH.
Justice Henshaw Finds That Hard
ship May Be Caused, but the Law
Must Be Observed-
The Associated Creditors of the City and
County of San Francisco, who have uncol
lected claims against the municipality
amounting to about $200,000, will be inter
ested in a decision handed down by the
Supreme Court yesterday. The part which
will most interest them may be the fol
lowing extract from the opinion, which
was written by Justice Henahaw, the case
being that of Max Goldsmith against the
Board of Supervisors of the City and
County of San Francisco, whicii has gen
erally been considered a test case:
"The reduction of the original claim to
a judgment does not increase its dignity
so as to authorize plaintiff to demand pay
ment of it from any fund not subject to
the primary demand."
The history of the case is as follows:
Max Goldsmith brought suit against the
Board of Supervisors to allow and order
paid a judgment against the City, ob
tained by the plaintiff for subsistence and
supplies for the prisoners in the jails of
the municipality for the fiscal year 1892-93,
which Goldsmith furnished under con
tract. There was no question concerning
the fact that the supplies were furnished
by Goldsmith. The demands for payment
for the supplies furnished during the last
three months of the fiscal year 1892-93
were refused. Goldsmith then secured a
judgment asrainst the City, but the Super
visors refused to order the judgment de
mand paid. Goldsmith applied for a writ
of mandate, and the Supervisors, for an
swer, showed that the general fund for
the fiscal year 1892-93 was totally ex
hausted and that the claim of Goldsmith,
turned into a judgment, was payable soleiy
out of this fund.
The paragraph quoted in the foregointt
from Justice Henshaw's opinion, which
was concurred in by Justices McFarland
and Temple, bears on this claim of the
Supervisors, the court also takine the po
sition indicated by the following:
'â¢It is sought to distinguish this claim
from the many which the court has been
called upon to discuss and to bring it
within the principle of Lewis ya. Widber â
99 Cal.. 412. Bnt, to the contrary, it is in
all essential features identical with that
considered in Pacific Undertakers ts.
Widberâ 4l Cal., 246. The reasoning there
set forth completely covers the facts and
the law in this case and leaves little to be
added. That hardships result from an
observance of the law may be deplored ;
bat this fact cannot afford reason for sab
verting the law or frittering it away."
The judgment is therefore affirmed. The
City wins and t^e creditors lose.
RABBI NIETO'S LEOTURE.
Compares the Analects of Confucius to
the Rabbis' Ethics.
Rabbi J. Nieto ad dressed a l.rge audience in
the Taylor-street synagogue last evening, on
the analects of Confucius and. the ethics of
the rabbis. The lecturer spoke, in part, as
follows:
"To claim for any one nation or people the
monopoly of all the ideals in virtue and eth
ics is to give one's self a certificate for bias
prejudice aud unreason, and to ignore the
part pla ed by the several and different races
with whom that particular one came into di
rect contact.
"So far as Christianity and Islamism are
concerned, with the exception of the pagan
ideas of the early peoples who aaopted them,
which had left their impress upon both sys
tems, Judaism has been their foundation and
Hebrew literature the channel through which
flowed the great volume of their teaching*.
This can be established only after a compari
son with that which was Judaism before the
first captivity and that which became Judaism
after the Hebrew miud had become seasoned
with the dogmas of Parseeism. Especially does
this appear in the introduction of the "Resur
rection" theory and the picture of the exist
ence of the soul after death. But be all this as
it may, the assumption of untenable positions
by the leaders of religious bodies to-day will,
society may rest perfectly assured, in no wise
subvert ihe order of the universe nor raise
again the ghost of persecution ; neither will it
revivify the long since petrified corpse of re
ligious haired. A ter all it is only a matter of
minor detail, and so long as mankind at large
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
can possess them and enjoy the benefits accru
ing to society from a study of these maxims,
what matter when, how or whence ?
"Taking as a standard of esteem the opinion
of the Chiisese held by the ordinary citizen of
San Francisco the last place in the world in
which one would look for evidences of ex
alted conduct or high-souled instruction
would be the Celestial empire. Now it must
be admitted beyond the shadow of a doubt
that personal appearance forms a by no means
unimportant factor in our minds when form
ing an estimate of an individual or race. To
the Caucasian eye the almond-eyed Celestial
has no claims to beauty, and so we have
judged his moral complexion by the tint of
his visage and narrowed his mind like unto
the shape of his eyelids. We have therefore
unwittingly disregarded the caution of the
Chinese philosopher, Confucius, who says,
'Fine words and an insinuating appearance
are seldom the proofs of virtue.'
"The Rabbis have their wicked man and
their 'Tsaddick' or righteous man. Coatucius
has his mean man and his superior man. In
the 'Ethics' we nnd that the highest Ideals are
virtue and sincerity, and the means of pre
serving the one and obtaining tue other cul
ture and study. In the Analects we find the
same ideals and the meansâ learning and fol
lowing the laws of propriety. Whether we
read the one or the other we are confronted
with the same estimate of the man who has
learning without culture, viz., the useless
ness of his knowledge. 'Speak little and
do much,' say the Rabbis; says Con
fucius, 'I care not to speak over
much, for consider the heavens, they do
not speak, yet the four seasons come and go
and all things continue to work.' Pretense
and deceit wern held by both schools in utter
detestation, and the simulation of piety was
alike couderanable in the opinions ot all. The
greatness of ihe man who not knowing a mut
ter had ihe courage to say 'l have not heard
it' was as reverently respected by the one
school as by the other. Deception is as strongly
denounced by Confucius as by the rabbis, and
lying is stamped as the deadliest ot all sins by
both. The ages of man and the duties of
each age are similarly construe*!. Youth for
study, manhood for work. The prime of liie
lor strength; age for wisdom, old age ior
counsel
"To perpetuate the study of the law was the
laudable ambition of the rabbis, and to insure
it they gathered around them worthy and
fitting disciples who should Decome teachers.
So did the followers of Coniucius, and the
same test is agreed upon by both schools. 'No
passionate man can be a teacher,' said Con
fucius. 'An angry man cannot be a rabbi,'
we read in the Ethics. There is. however, this
difference, that while the rabbis incu.cated
the fear of heaven as a deterrent to sin Con-
Jucius held out the promise of heaven to
those who are sincere; a case of fear versus
hope. The motto of both is 'Virtue for its
own saKe.'
"To my mind, in consideration of the evi
dences thus afforded us, it is puerileâ nay, in
fantileâ to attempt to assert and maintain the
superiority of race or nation. Men should
be judged by their mind and manners, ana na
tions esteemed likewise. Ido not think that
the Jew is the greatest man upon earth nor es
teem my rac>.' above all others, but satisfy
myself with re-echoing the hope of Moses, as
expressed In Deuteronomy, that the peoples ot
earth will recognize the Jew as the peer ot any
man. We are, and but claim to be part of hu
manity, nor better nor worse" than any other
civilized part thereot."
FOUND UNCONSCIOUS..
Francis A. Cramer Suffers Apparently
From a Stroke of Apoplexy.
Francis A. Cramer, a retired merchant,
formerly of the firm of Montealegre & Co., was
conveyed in an ambulance from the Bohemian
Club to his residence, 820 Sutter street, at 11
o'clock last night.
it was observed about 9 o'clock by George T.
Bromley and others that Mr. Cramer had been
reclining on a lounge In the cafe for an un
usual length of time. It was also noticed that
he was suffering pain or discomfort, and Mr.
Bromley spoke to him but received no answer.
Dr. Swan, who happened to be in the dining
room, was called, and found the aged merchant
unconscious. The heavy breathing of the
patient indicated apoplectic trouble. The
physician rendered every service possible, but
was unable to restore the patient to conscious
ness. The Montealegres, with whom Mr.
Cramer had long been associated, were sum
moned, and took the sick man to his rooms on
Sutter street. Mr. Cramer is 73 years of age

THE SUGAR INDUSTRY.
Two items of news published in The
Call of Thursday should be studied to
gether. One was the appeal of Speaker
Reed to the Duluth Chamber of Commerce
for a vigorous support of a revenue bill
before Congress this winter. The otber
was a report from the Department of State
at Washington showing that the raw
sugar supply of the world tliis year will be
one of the larce.-t ever known.
Mr. Reed's appeal was virtually a re
quest for popular support of the Dingley
bill or something like it. That bill was in
its nature a compromise measure. It was
neither on the lints of free trade nor of
protection. It was devised solely for the
purpose of raising a revenue equal to the
expenditures of the Government. Among
the great industries which it left without
protection was that of the production of
sugar. It is for that reason, therefore, the
report of the State Department on the
world's sugar supply is pertinent to the
issue involved in Mr. Reed's appeal.
The Dingley bill did not provide any
protection tv our sugar industry, and the
reports of the State Department show
that such protection is absolutely neces
sary. Several of the greatest nations in
Europe give bounties for the production
of sugar and one of them pays a further
bounty on its export. It is clear, there
fore, that if we are to compete on equal
terras with the foreigner our Government
must do something to protect the home
industry.
The issue is one of particular impor
tance to California. It is within the
limit of possibility and even of probability
that California should become eventually
the home of a sugar industry capable of
supplying all the sugar which the peopl
of America need. We have a climate and
a soil better adapted lor the production of
susar-beets than any other in the Union
if not in the world. We have the capital
ready to invest in the enterprise and we
have, moreover, the man capable of mak
ing such investments profitable and such
enterprises successful in every respect. It
is therefore most important to us that
whatever tariff bill is presented to Con
gress should be one in which due regard is
paid to the promotion of this great in
dustry.
The people of California recognize the
importance of the immediate passage of
a bill which would provide a revenue suf
ficient to pay the expenses of the Govern
ment. They are aware that the present
deficits going on from montli to month
are a serious evil to tne Nation. They are
desirous that some measures should be
adopted to put an end to them, but they
do not believe that any measure for the
raising of revenue would be more effect
ive than oue which would provide for a
duty on sugar of sufficient amount at
least to afford some protection to the
home industry. Therefore they do not
favor the Dingley bill as reported last
winter. They desire revenue and protec
tion to go hand in hand, and have good
reason for believing that a bill providing
for both thesa things has as good chance
of being adopted as would the compromise
measure of which so much has been said.
THE MINERS' FIGHT.
It is now evident that the resolution of
the California Miners' Association declar
ing a desire for the appointment of a Sec
retary of Mines and Mining is not going
to be dropped without a vigorous effort to
attain It. In tact the agitation beeun in
thiÃ State will be taken up elsewhere
and carried on until the desired end is
achieved.
Tne extent to which the desire of the
miners is supported by the leaders of
thought in California can be estimated
from the statements of prominent men
published in The Cat.i. during the past
wee*, it cannot be doubted that these re
flect the general sentiment of our people,
and it is fair to assume therefore tdat
California is virtually united on the sub
ject
As an immediate result from this declar
ation of public opinion in California we
may look for earnest support from otber
mining States. The issue, fortunately, is
not a sectional one. It concerns the iron
and coal miners of the East as well as the
gold and silver miners of the West, and
when once squarely presented to Congress
will be favored by delegates from all quar
ters of the Union.
The preliminary work of organizing the
fight will of course devolve upon the
miners of California, and steps in that
direction should be taken as early as pos
sible. In this work our delegation in
Congress can render important service,
and every man of them should let it be
known that he can be counted on to do
his share in advancing this justice to our
miners and their industry.
The Call has taken up the cause of the
miners with the same ardor with which it
supports every California interest and can
be depended on to do all in its power to
promote the movement and advance it to
success. We call upon the press of all the
mining States to assist us in tnese efforts.
The object aimed at is for the general
good and we hope to see the question
brought forward at an early day in Con
gress and the campaign of education en
tered upon with vigor and effect.
FOR HOME INDUSTRY.
The effort of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association to combine the
various organizations in the City for the
purpose of promoting home industry
ought to receive not only encouragement
but all the co-operation which may be
needed to carry it to complete success.
At the meeting held ou Thursday to
further this purpose there were present
delegations not only from the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, but
from the State Board of Horticulture, the
Merchants' Association, tlie Chamber of
Commerce, tbe Board of Education, the
Board of Health and the Builders' Ex
change. These bodies form in the aggre
gate a potent force in the City, and if they
work together can undoubtedly accom
plish the objects for which they are united.
There can be no question that earnest
work should be done on behalf of our
home industries. We do not as yet manu
facture as much of our own raw material
as our own people need. We export wool
and buy back blankets. We send abroad
fresh fruit and pay high prices for jams
and jellies. All our raw materials,
leather, hardwood and other products are
treated in toe same way. Thus, even the
home consumption of borne products is
not supplied through the medium of home
manufactures.
Even what we do manufacture is not
widely consumed by our people. In too
many instances we buy products from
abroad when the home product is not only
cheaper but better. This feature of the
situation, however, is largely due to the
fact that the extent and variety of our
home products are not generally known.
Many people who would consume them if
they tnew of them buy foreign goods
simply because they have never beard of
the California article.
It was suggested at the meeting on
Thursday that the popular knowledge of
California products should be increased
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 18 I J6.
by the introduction of textbooks on home
industries in the public schools. This
plan, while ingenious, we believe is
neither advisable nor feasible. No text
book could possibly keep up with the
growth of industry, nor could it include
all industries. It would not be fair for the
State to advertise tome product to the ex
clusion of others, and the scheme there
fore would provoke opposition. There is
in fact but oue way by which industry can
make itself known to the public, and that
is by persistent and extensive advertising.
On the need of advertising we do not
care to dwell at this time. That is an
issue apart from the general one of pro
moting home industry. The proposed
combination of all the associations can
hardly be expected to undertake advertis
ing, and therefore that phase of the ques
tion is not pertinent to their organiza
tion. What they can do is to assist in the
general work of promoting local indus
tries, and to that end they ought to have
the co-operation of all industrial and com
mercial bodies not of this City only, but
of the whole State.
THE HATCH FAILURE.
The failure of A. T. Hatch is in some
respects a loss to the State of California.
He is one of those men who, not content
with existing good, reaches out for better
things. He has done much to promote
the fruit industry of the State, and was
engaged in a bold enterpiise to flo more
when failure came upon him.
It vouid be bard to overestimate the
benefits which have resulted to the fruit
growers of California from the experi
ments and enterprises which Mr. Hatch
carried out. He was always prompt and
ready to undertaKe anything which prom
ised an improvement in tbe industry, and
his services in that respect were various,
extensive, and in most cases completely
successful.
As was said by A. G. Freeman in com
menting on the failure:
So fruit-grower has surpassed Mr. Hatch in
intelligence and industry. His study of fruit
culture has added vastly to the wealth of this
Suite He was the first man to risk the experi
ment of shipping fruit to the Eastern markets
by tue refrigerator process. When that plan
u:.s adopted only a few carloads was sent
East; now thousands of cars are employed in
such shipments.
Not content with improving the indus
try at borne and promoting the market for
it in the East Mr. Hatch undertook the
vast enterprise of opening the way for the
larger markets of London and the world.
It was to his ardor in the last undertak
ing that his failure is largely due. What
he accomplished, however, wiil s>erve the
benefit of others. The failure of to-day
will prepare the means for the success of
to-morrow. We shall yet find profits in
European markets, and that success when
it comes will be due in no email measure
to the efforts of the man who has now
gone down in the attempt to accomplis . it.
It in gratifying to knew that Mr. Hatch
does not himself regard his, present bad
condition as a complete failure. In an in
terview with him published in The Call
yesterday he said:
Yes, I have lived in a $10 room and con
tented myself with 15-cent meals in order to
pull through. My failure now does not in any
sense mean my ruin. I shall start again, and
am sure that 1 will again succeed. I have the
utmost confidence in California as a fruit
growing State.
California needs such men as A. T.
Hatch. She needs men of just such
pluck, such enteroriee and such faith in
themselves and in her future. The failure
of such a man even temporarily is a seri
ous loss. There will, therefore, be a gen
eral hope that Mr. Hatch will soon be on
his feet again and able once more to Jead
our industries to higher levels and open
for them wider and more profitable mar
kets.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
One of the important features of The
Sunday Call that is appreciated most
heartily by the younger people in the
thousands of homes in which the paper is
a welcome guest and friend is that depart
ment known as Childhood's Realm. Chil
dren everywhere find delight in the pace,
which is prepared especially for their
pleasure by one who has made a study of
the neeas of the little ones in the way of
interesting, attractive, appropriate and at
the same time instructive literature.
To-morrow's childhood department is
remarkably rich in timely stories and
poems, nearly all of which, as might be
expected, have a Thanksgiving flavor. The
illustrations are excellent and in keeping
with tbe other merits of what is, without
any exception, the best and most carefully
edited children's department to be found
in all the papers of the Paciiic Coast
For the benefit of the ladies let it be said
that the fashion page of The Sunday Call
is always up to date and accurate, and
may be relied upon io give the very latest
fashion news from New York, London
and Pans. The page is replete with use
ful suggestions of current value, with
reference to the art which aims to clothe
beauty in robes that will enhance beauty's
charms.
Among the special articles in to-mor
row's issue will be a graphic account of
an elephant-hunt in Siam by one who
participated in the exciting sport. The
illustrations are from photographs taken
by B. Carrington of Banekok, Siam, and
nothing like them or comparable to them
in the grandeur of their scope has ever
before appeared in an American news
paper.
Coulter's pen-drawing of the first ship
that ever entered the Golden Gate will be
a treasure in itself, aud as it ia the inten
tion to publish, from Sunday to Sunday, a
series of drawings embracing, in all,
every type of vessel that has anchored in
San Francisco Bay, it will be worth while
to preserve these sketches from the very
beginning, as the Story of Ships, wben
complete, will make a valuable collection.
Mr. Coulter stands in the very first rank
of the marine artists of America.
Tnere are a hundred and one otber
features in The Sunday Call, but suffice
it to say that it is a model newspaper â
ciean, bright, thoughtful, entertaining
and no household should be without it.

THE VOTE OF THE CITIES.
New York Han.
The' recent election brought disastrous and
humiliating defeat for the Democratic party
in the large cities of the country. New York,
for tbe first time in a Presidential election in
the history of American politics, was carried
by the Republicans or, more properly, went
against the Democratic nominee. Chicago
gave more thai: 50,000 majority for McKinley
and Hobart; Philadelphia more than 100,000.
Two former Democratic strongholds, rallying
points of Democratic influence and organiza
tion, Baltimore and Louisville, went Rspubli
can. carrying with them the electoral vote of
the States of which they are the chief cities, Ma
ryland and Kentucky, the former Democratic
since 18t>4, and the latter Democratic since
labO. Brooklyn, long a Democratic stronghold,
was carried for Mr. McKinley by a majority
larger than it ever gave a Demccrattc National
ticket; ana Boston, on the Democratic lead in
whiih ail hopes of success in the State of
Massachusetts has been uniformly based, went
in tavorot the Repub.icans and honest-money
Democrats by a majority exceeding 20,000.
iiuffalio, which has been generally Democratic
of late years, excepi when Mr. Cleveland, a
former resilient, was the Democratic nominee,
and then was either close or Republican, has
now been carried by the Republicans by a
majority as large as they had in Cincinnati,
anu larger thin the majority for the Republi
can electoral ticket m bt. "Louis. In fact, of
all the large cities, four only wf re not carried
by McKinley and Hobart. These are Wash
ington. D. C, the citizens of which have no
vote in the Presidential election; New
Orleans, Denver aud Suit Lake Ci^y.
THE SOUTH IS WEARY.
The party must turn its back upon the
unwise leaders who have brought disaster
upon it. It must return to the safer path laid
out by its founders.â Florida Citizen.
The county has had enough financial ajtita
tiou, and what is needed now is peace and an
opportunity to work. The Butlers, Tillmans
and other professional agitators must go into
retirement.â Memphis Appeal.
The party -will never adopt a platform like
the Chicago one again, and we seriously ques
tion whether it will ever again accept as lead
ers the men vrho were chiefly instrumental
in making it.â Savannah News.
Mr. Bryan and other popocratic leaders may
lower themselves back into private life with
assertions that the-.r cause is still alive and
that the fight will be continued, but the free
and unlimited coinage of silver received its
quie'.us for all time.â San Antonio Express.
The platform of 189t> must be repented of and
never referred to except as a warning. There
is no reason why Southern Democrats, ac
knowledginÃ the bitter failure of tue popu
listic free-silver combination, should not, as
the hunts-men say, "hark back" to the trail
they lost, and take up the principles of 1892
and make a fresh start.â Richmond Times.
Mr. Bryan and others are telling us how to
save the Democratic party and down the
Republicans in 1900. One man's opinion is as
good as another's in this regard, and we are
entitled to express ours, which is to this effect:
The Democrats of this country will have to
learn, as truths, these things before they can
ever again hope to control the Government of
this Republic: That bimetallism, or the con
current use of gold and silver coin as a parity,
is a myth. That there is no natural antago
nism between labor and capital. That social
ism is negation of progress, and tnat progress
is the keynote of the Republic. That the
Federal Government; has the right to execute
its own court processes. That the credit of the
United States must be sustained. âMobile

M. PAGE MINER of the Queer Minarets Iron Mine
[Sketched from life by a "Call " artist.]
QUEER ORE FROM
THE MINARETS
Remarkable Formation of
Iron in the Sierras
East of Fresno.
Owned by Prominent Men and
Experted by the Pacific
Rolling Mills.
M Page Miner on tbe Enormous Size
and Qualityâ Copper, Wool and
Cattle Interests.
M. Page Miner, who hns been rusticat
ing in the mountains with a rendezvous
at Fresno for two or three years past, has
arrived here with somo large and strange
specimens of ore. The ore is magnetic
iron and comes from a curious place
eighty-rive milee northeast of Fresno,
called tbe Minarets.
The Minarets stand out as mountain
crags. They have taken on fantastic
shapes, and are of pure magnetic iron, as
is a large part of tho mountain below, as
the story goes. The Pacific Rolling-mills
have been examining the property, and
now figures up in the millions are being
quoted as the sum for which the queer
Minarets property is to be sold.
Mr. Miner talked about the property
last night at the Occidental, where he is
staying. He told a story the like of which
has not been seen in any book lor a long
time. Part of it ran:
"This is a mine of solid iron. It is 400
feet wide, six miles in length and from 100
to 2500 feet in depth, all vistble. It ana- |
lyzes from (JO to 72 per cent of iron, and is
one of the greatest ever discovered in the
world. There is enough iron there to
build ail the railroads of the United
States, and then build a bridge to Mars."
L. C. Huehes of Fresno is interested in
the great iron mountain, as are "Wiley J.
Tinnin and others of that city. Near the
Minarets iron mine are large outcrop
pings of quartz containing some gold and
silver, and, as though this was not enough, j
there is a vein of copper not far away, j
The stories about the copper vein are j
large also.
Miner, who jumps around lively fromj
one place to another, has aiso some copper '
property near the Grand Canyon ot the !
Colorado. He has recently come from
there.
"The property is near Hance's, from j
Williams, Ariz," said he. "It Rives 60 â 
per cent in copper. Mining down there is
looking up. All the prospectors, whether
for gold, silver or copper, are meeting with
signal success. Things are looking better.
Wool has jumped from 4 cents to 10. And
cattle, there is such a demand for them
that they are being brought from Cali
fornia to restock tbe ranges.
Queer tales are told regarding Miner's
iron mine, as for instance one about the
ore being so magnetized that it once pulled
the hobnails out of the shoes of men who
walked over it. Also, that once when
Professor Wulf of the Pacific Roliing-mills
was walking across the queer Minarets he
stuck fast and could not budge a pee.
Solicitous friends finally learned the

FOR DEPUTY AUDITOR.
A Number of Aspirants Who Desire to
Succeed Captain Thomas.
Auditor Broderick is figuring on a
deputy to succeed Captain Thomas, who
died a few days ago, and a number of
aspirants for the lucrative position are
exerting all their influence to get the job.
Daniel O'Leary, who has been connected
with the office for a long period, feels con
fident that his claim on tne berth is a
jrood one and expects to receive the plum.
Mr. O'Leary has many triends, political
and otherwise, who are "pulling" for him
and singing his praises to the Auditor.
It is expected that the position will be
filled within a few days.
Spalding and the Hawaiian Cable.
Among the arrivals at the Palace is Colonel
F. Z Spalding, who for years has been promi
nent in political and commercial circles in
the Hawaiian Islands. For two or three years
past he has held an exclusive concession for
the laying of a submarine cable between Hon'
o.ulu and San Francisco. He has been abroad
in Europe for the past fifteen months, but
says the trip to the islands now has nothing
to do with the; cable- He will return here
when Congress opena and agitate the cable
question.

WAS BORN AMID
ICE AND SNOW
A Little Stranger That Ar
rived on the Steam
Whaler Beluga.
Her Name Is Helen Herschel
Sherman and Her Father Is
Captain of the Whaler.
A Young Oakland Girl, Craz:d Over
Her Lever's Desertion, Tried to
Kill Captain Alexander.
The long-overdue steam whaling bark
Beluga arrived in port yesterday after a
long cruise in the Arctic. The vessel left
here in March, 1894, and Captain Sherman
and his wife have kept each other com
pany in the frozen north. Since the de
parture of the whaler there has been an
audition to the "all-told" list, in May,
1895, when the Beluga was in her winter
quarters off Herschet Island, a daughter
was born to Captain Sheriuan. The little
one was named Helen Herschel Sherman,
and ever since she has been the pet of the
crew. The first year of her life the littie
one spent in the Arctic, and surely never
such an experience was the lot of the
child of Englibh-^peaking parents. Slie
reveled in the ice and snow, and on one
occasion, when twelve months old, bad
her photograph taken on the ice. She
could not stand alone, but four sailors
held two ropes, and between them the lit
tie woman balanced herself and was taken
by the kodak fiend in the shape of the
wife of the captain of the Thrasher.
During the run to Â£an Francisco Cap
tain Sherman was a very sick man with a
strained back and Mrs. Sherman was laid
up with rheumatism. Little Helen was,
therefore, left in a great measure to the
tender mercies of the crew, and a queen
never reigned over more willing subjects.
She was monarch of all she surveyed and
her right there was none to dispute, be
cause from the chief officer down to the
cabin-boy all bowed down before Miss
Helen and her slightest nod was law. The
J men worshiped the little one, and the
I privilege of holding her for ten or fifteen
j minutes repaid them for an extra trick at
the wheel or for the call of all hands when
sail had to be snortened.
Helen rierschel Sherman is the first
child of American parents, and In fact the
first [child of English-speaking parents,
that has been born so far north. If she
lives and the question is asked her in
years to come "'Where were you born?"
her answer will be "On board the steam
whaler Beluga, in the ice off the mouth of
the McKenzie River."
The Beluga was a long time reaching
I San Francisco. Slie put into Plover Bay
i to land the native members of the crew
l and later on the machinery was disabled.
Chief Engineer Pierson managed to fix up
the damage and she came along under
Helen Herschei Sherman,
Tho first child of European parents ever born
as lar north as the Mackenzie River. The little
one arrived here on the Beluga yesterday,
easy steam. Headwinds, kept her back
and when the southeaster was met nearly
all the sails were blown out of the bolt
ropes. . The ; fog was "thick enough to
cut" according to Chief Officer Thatcher
and for a week it was impossible to Bee
the sun. When the first observation was
taken the vessel was off Point Sur and the
i course had to be shaped anew for San
! Francisco. Headwinds and storms were
attain encountered and in consequence
the Beluga made an unusually long trip.
The Beluga broueht down 21.000 pounds
of whalebone, 23,554 barrels of whale oil,
170 pounds of ; ivory, 17 bear skins, 218 fox
skins, 25 musk skins, 4 wolf skins and 6
beaver skins. In all twenty whales were
taKen, eleven being caught and tried out
during the last month of the season. The
vessel has been unusually successful and
the crew was jubilant at she started up
the bay to the Arctic Oil Works yester
day.
.Captain Alexander of the steamer Santa
Rosa had an experience he is not likely to
Jorget in'a hurry during the last trip of
I his vessel. He was clawed and bit by a
maniac, and bad it not been . for the inter
ference of bystanders be might -have lost
his life. As it was, the young woman who
tried to end his life escaped, but was after
ward recaptured and again placed on the
Kant a Rosa."
Many months ago Miss Hattie Cotler of
Oakland had an altercation with her
parents and, leaving home, want to live
with some relatives on a ranch near Ban
Diego. There she met a young man with
whom she fell in love, and the day for, the
marriage was set. She got her weading car
menis ready and was arrayed for the cere
mony when the hour came around. The
groom did not put in an appearance, and
after waiving several hours the guests bad
,to be dismissed. It was then that Miss
Cotler' s mind gave way and her relatives
decided to send her home. .' Â»
V While the Santa Rosa was at Santa
Barbara Captain Alexander thought it
would be sale to take the young lady up
town on the carp. There was quite a walk
from the steamer to the car terminus, and
the gallant captain attempted to make the
journey interesting by pointing out differ
ent landmarks *fonÂ£. the 'â '- way. _ : Suddenly
Miss Cotler flew at him like a tigress/ and
without a word of warning began scratch
ing and clawing. She asserted that Alex
ander was the man who was to have mar
ried her, and vowed she was going to have
her 'revenge.; She was finally feubdued,
and later was locked up in her stateroom.
Captain Alexander heaved a sigh of relief
when ?he the last of her yesterday
morning. The young woman is now with
her relatives in Oakland, and will proba
bly bo sent to a private asylum..

The Window From Which Chow
Ute Leaped*
DUPLICITY OF A
CHINESE GIRL
Little Chow Ute Now De
nies That She Was
Kidnaped.
Jumped About Sixteen Feet to a
Hard Pavement Without
Injury.
O.ficer Grunwaid Mystified That the
Chinese Should Appeal to Him
for Aid.
The tale of the alleged kidnaping of
Chow Ute, the pretty 15-year old Chinese
girl placed la the Presbyterian Mission
Home last Monday, has taken a rather
peculiar turn. The girl now denies that
she was abducted, but asserts, on the con
trary, that she went away willingly with
Low Yuen Yue.
Not content with a denial of her former
statements in reeard to leaving, she goes
even further and denies that she was mar
ried to any of the brothers Yuen, of whom
it now appears there are three.
In view of her denial the criminal ele
ment lias necessarily disappeared from the
case, and Officer George Grunwald, who
had bpen industriously engaged in search
ing for the alleged abductors, ceased his
efforts last night.
The mysterious element of the case still
remains. It is hard to tell why the three
Chinese should approach two police
oflicers at 5 o'clock in the morning and
ofler to remunerate them well for assisting
in removing ihe girl from over the cigar
establishment on Dupont street, near Cali
fornia, when the eirl was perfectly willing
to go any plac they wished.
"Th.it is bard to explain," said Grun
wald last night. "If the girl had ko*a
along quietly with them no one would
have paid any attention to the party.
"But they came deliberately and asked
us to help them, thus making themselves
liable to detection, and, further, offered a
bribe."
Another strange factor in the affair is
that the girl claims she jumped from .i
window fifteen or sixteen feet from the
ground to the hard concrete pavement be
neath. As the front and rear doors of the
Mission were securely locked and the keys
in the possession of the superintendent
this is believed by the teachers to be true.
The girl says that only one Chinese was
waiting for her, and that she jumped into
his arms. Her slightly abrased cheek
and the wrenching of a lower limb bears
this statement out.
STATUARY TOE CHUROHES.
Waldteufel't Importation f o Br Investi
gated by the Grand Jury.
The United States Grand Jury will soon
make matters very uncomfortable for the
Waldteufel beir3 or assigns, who keep a
stationery, art and statuary store at 723
Market street. About two months ago
Special Agent of the Treasury Moore dis
covered that Waldteufel had displayed for
sale in his store window three pieces of
statuary which Moore thought had
been fraudulently passed through the
Custom-house from France. He made
a careful investigation and found
that a priest at Banning had or
dered two pieces of statuary for his
church through the Market-street firm,
and in order to have the statuary exemot
from duty he affirmed upon oath and in
writing that the sacred ornaments were
for tne cuurch.
After the priest had signed for two it
was discovered that an insertion had been
made whereby the statuary was increased
from two to tive pieces, and yet in the
long run tne priest received only the two
that he had bargained for. Upon the
presentation of this evidence to the Col
lector of Customs the three pieces of statu
ary were seized by the customs officials,
who eventually arrived at the conclusion
that perjury and forgery had been com
mitted in order to get the whole consign
ment through the Custom-house.
The case has been in the hands of the
Collector for several weeks, but no move
was made so far as could be learned until
yesterday, when the iacts were presented
to United States District Attorney Foote.
When the new United States Grand Jury
is selected next Tuesday Mr. Footo will
i. resent tho facts to that body i'or further
investigation.

Foster, Mrs. Susie Musante, Jerome
i Deasy, Mrs. Sarah Deasy, T. J. Qui^ley
and Dr. C. W. Card â were again called on
to tell what they knew of Mrs. Martin's
mental condition.
No material difference from the testi
i niony given last week was noted, and but
little interest was aroused except in \he
examination of Dr. Card.
Deputy District Attorney Hinkle at
tempted to show by Dr. Card that Mrs.
Martin is a dangerous person to beat
large, and asked the physician, who at
tended her before and after the killing of
her husband, whether a similar stress of
excitement would be likely to cause a re
turn of that homicidal mania which.it was
admitted, bad caused the death of a
human being.
Atttorney Eddy objected to this conrse
I of examination, as he said it would be try
i ing to convict a person on a possibility in
the future, a remote contingency which he
thought the law would not recognize.
Judge Wallace replied that under a well
known rule of law things once proved to
exist are presumed to continue as long as
is reasonable with things of that nature,
and allowed the question.
Dr. Card replied that he would not give
! a positive opinion touching a recurrence
of the homicidal mania.
The hearing of testimony will be re
sumed at 10 o'clock next Monday morning.

WANTED TO LOOK
AT THE FAIR DEED
Breszy Scene Between At
torney Lloyd and Mr.
Delmas.
Argument in Regard to the
Right of Inspecting the
Document.
That Which Was Offered as a Cour
tesy Finally Grant d by an
Order of the Court.
There was a breezy scene in Judge
Slack's court yesterday morning when the
application of Attorney Reuben H. Lloyd
for a chance to examine the deed of the
late James G. Fair, conveying certain
property to Mrs. Nettie K. Craven, was
called for hearing.
The proceedings disclosed the fact that
there was an undercurrent of feeling ex
isting in the minds of opposing counsel
that even the cool exterior, so well as
sumed by veteran membora of the bar,
could not entirely conceal.
Before beginning with the argument D.
M. Delmas, representing the interests of
Mrs. Craven, announced to the court that
so far as he was concerned he had no ob
jection to the inspection of the document
by any person interested in the case. He
said that the document had already been
submitted to the scrutiny of someof the
attorneys on the other side, and when ap
plication was made a day or two ago for
an additional opportunity to inspect it the
gentlemen were informed that they were
welcome to make any legitimate use of the
document that they might desired Not
withstanding this assurance on the part
of himself and the gentlemen associated
with him this motion for an order of court
to procure the thing that had be?n volun
tarily offered was brought into court.
Judge Slack smiled gently and remarked
that he supposed, under the circum
stances, it would not be necessary to fur
ther Dress the application then on bear
ing.
Mr. Lloyd, who represents the heirs of
J. G. Fair, said tiiat notwithstanding Mr.
Delmas' courteous offer, it was a fact that
on the day that this order was asked for,
an application for an inspection of the
deed was refused.
Attorney Denson, wno sat with Mr.
De.mas, asked permission to explain that
circumstance. He said that he was pres
ent when the demand for an inspection of
the deed was made. A deposition was
being taken at the time, and when the
deed was asked for the reply was made
that they were not at that moment in
possession of the document, ana, there
fore, must decline to comply with the re
quest. An offer was made to procure it
later. He said it was not Mr. Delmas who
declined to produce the document.
Mr. Lloyd retorted that it was Mr. Del
mas' representative with whom he was
dealing at that time, and he considered
that his acts were the same as the acts of
Mr. Delmas.
Garret McEnerney, who is engaged in
another branch ef the case and who was
willing to have the examination of the
paper procured with as little friction as
poisible, endeavored to pour oil on the
troiiDlod waters. He thought that Mr.
Delmas' offer ought to be considered suffi
cient. He trusted that the application for
the order would not be pressed by Mr.
Lloyd.
A settlement on that basis seemed im
minent, when Attorney Wheeler sug
gested, sotto voce, that Mr. De.mas ought
to be required to set a day when the docu
ment might be inspected, and Mr. Lloyd
said as much to the court in deafly audi
ble toaes.
The fat was in the fire again, for it was
apparent that Mr. Delmas did not like to
have the proposition put that way. He
said that "while he was willing to grant
the application as a courtesy, yet if tiie
gentleman insisted on it as a right he was
prepared to present arguments against it.
Mr. Lloyd was equally unyielding in his
position, and the bearing proceeded.
Able arguments lasting three hours were
offered pro and con, and after considera
tion Judge Slack held that Mr. Lloyd and
his associates have a right to inspect the
deed, and this formality is set for Monday

IN SPORTING FIELDS.
News From All Departments of the Sports-
man's Realm*
Wheelmen will be well represented to
day at the opening of the new Velodrome
track, provided the weather will be favor
able for outdoor sports. It is said that
tbe grand stand will accommodate 4000
spectators.
Sportsmen are now enjoying first-class
shooting in the marshes. With the recent
storm arrived large numbers of northern
birds, and shooting will be good until the
very heavy rains, then "the quackers"
will depart for the grain fields of Southern
California.
The oarsmen will have a gala day on
Thursday next. The regatta which will
be held over the Aiameda course will at
tract a large gathering from this side of
the bay. The course will be surveyed on
Monday next and the entries will close on
Monday evening.
The Ingleside coursing park will be
opened on Sunday and a first-class pro
gramme has been arranged.
Latest accounts from the Russian River
state that the rainstorm has increased the
supply of water in the river and good fish
ing will soon be had.
THE WHEELMEN
The Velodrome Opening and Wells
vs. Foster Match Races To-Day.
There is little to be added to what has
already been said about the grand open
ing of the new Velodrome bicycle track,
Jocated on the block bounded by Hayes,
Fell, Baker and Lyon streets, which will
"Walter R Fawcett, Manager of the
New Velodrome Track*
take place this afternoon. The entry list,
handicaps and complete programme of
events was given in The Call yesterday.
The exact order in which the races and
heats will be ridden was given, and with
that article before one a programme will
be unnecessary.
Dozens of people have asked me who
I thought would win the match races be
tween Wells and Foster to-day, and with
absolutely no partisan feeling on either
side, and with a perfect knowledge of the
condition of the two men and their past
performances for years back, I have been
unable to say. They are as nearly matched
as any two men on the coast could be. I
might venture that Foster will have a
little the best of the one-mile run and
Wells of the five-mile, but the advantage
either way, if any, is too slight to count.
Wells is slower to start a sprint than
Foster, being more oulky, out he has the
most endurance. He has also had the ad
vantage of two seasons on the National
circuit, but that won't serve him to much
good in a match race, and particularly
against such an old hand at the game as
Walter Foster.
A great deal of money has been wagered
on the result of the races, the odds being
even. It iB 6to 5 Foster will win the mile
and 6 to 5 Wells will win the five mile.
And there you are.
Between the two clubs the men belong
to, the Bay City Wheelmen and Olympic
Club Wheelmen, tliere has always been
an intense rivalry and that has naturally
extended to the men and all the members.
They will all turn out in full force this
afternoon to help "root" for their favorite
and one side or the other is bound to go
broke on the result. It will be the race
of the year surely, and between two as
game, speedy and gentlemanly fellows as
ever threw a leg over a saddle. May the
best man win.
Wilbur F. Knapp of the Bay City
Wheelmen, the popular announcer at all
racemeets on the coast, will be home in a
few days from his Eastern trip. Knapp
has closed a deal to represent the World
people on the coast for next year, and
will use his endeavors to bring that firms
big racing team here this winter, consist
ing of Johnson, Michael, Waller and sev
eral pacing teams.
To-morrow Captain Lewis will lead the
members of the San Francisco Road Club
on a blind run. Last night they enjoyed
a trip to Sutro's Baths on the cars. The
club's dance, to be held the second Tues
day evening in December, win be auite a
social function in the cycling world. It
will be at Union-square Hall.
There are 752 league clubs in the United
States. The total membership is now
69,640, of which the North California di-
Vision has 1640. New York has attained
the goal sought by passing the 20,000 mark,
having to date 20,131 members.
Captain Henry L. Day will take the
members of the Bay City Wheelmen to
Laundry Farm to-morrow, via tbe 9 a. m.
creek-route boat. The hotel there has
been sampled and its table reported excel
lent. Necessary implements for football
and baseball will be taken along, to make
the run a picnic. The club's handicap
pool tournament begins next Monday
evening and there is a large entry list, in
cluding such crack players as Pike, Lea
vitt, K^llum, Fred Day, Rhys, Menne,
George Caidwell, Welch, iMummer, Rob
erts, George Hall, Merry, Bob Terrin,
Lund, Harloe, Howard, Dixon and Spal
ding.
Frank Foster of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen, who was Zeigler's trainer on
tne National circuit in 1895 and Coulter's
in the early part of 1896, returned Thurs
day from the East. He has been handling
Ray Macdonald, who was here with the
Colnmbia team in 1895 and whose remark
able showing while in trance this year
was the subject of much comment. Mac
donald went across the water as an ordi
nary star in a team of Tom Eck's, with
Johnny Johnson as the planet. Mac's
orbit was not large enough for him, how
ever, and he was soon swinging in
Johnny's circle and finally totally eclipsed
him in point of winnings and speed.
Foster says he expects to go to Australia
with Ray early next year and that Eddie
Bald may go with them.
The scramble of cyclists ail over the
country to secure special paths for their
own exclusive use is nine times out ot ten
energy expended in the wrong direction.
What wheelmen should do, according to a
prominent official of the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen, is to work for better roads.
With these secured there would be no call
for special paths. The wheelmen are be
ginning to realize this and several of the
State divisions of the league will work
this winter to secure good roads through
legislative enactment.
Captain Black of the Golden Gate Cycl
ing Club has called a run for to-morrow to
the park and Presidio. F. Derby, V. C.
Turret!, P. Clifford and W. T. Dwyer have
recently been, elected to membership.
There is still some talk of the big World
ri cord team coming to this State â perhaps
to Coronado, perhaps to San Jose oi to the
new Velodrome here. The team is now at
Memphis, and next Momlav will go to
Nashville. It has no dates after December
1, and if the Velodrome people are alive
and really want good talent here is the
opportunity. Some idea of the fast work
the team does can be gleaned from the
following, taken from Bearings' New
Orleans correspondent:
Yesterday the Phillips triplet took Michael
three miles in G:O2, while the Cooks triplet
toot him three more in 6 :1<3. Waller followed
Miehr.el live ruiies of the distance. Johnson
went out back of tho Waller quad, and did his
first mile in 1:50, quitting for a time to wait
ior the Jallu brothers' triplet team. When
the Frenchmen came out Johnny rode several
miles vi a two-minute clip. After -Michael
rode his six miles tie claimed he waa too fat,
so he ran all the way back to the hotel, a dis
tance of live miles, and then, donning two
sweaters, bkipped :he rope for an hour. This
mornii.g he is riding twenty-five miles on the
road, and this afternoon in:ends to no twenty
five miles behind the pacing machines at the
track.
Probably the most wonderful perform
ance yet made by the team was the break
ing of the world's five-mile record by
Michael on November 8 at New Orleans,
he Bringing tbe mark down to the phe
nomenal figures ol 9:12 3-5. A most inter
esting description of the trial is given by
F. fed Spooner, who witnessed it :
In the morning Michael walked five miles
to the track, then did seven miles in 15:25.
which goes to show what a horse the young
ster is for wort. In the afternoon the weather
conditions were far from favorable for record
breaking, a strong wind blowing on the back
streich, making it hard for both pacemakers
and man. The heavens had been cloudy all
day, and rain threatened at any moment.
However it was determined to make the at
tempt, ana the sextuplet maniied by its regu
lar crew was brought out. The start was most
favorable, tie big machine, with Michael
tucked under its wing, holding the turns with
ease. Tne "sex" took him the first mile in
1:45 2-5, fast going tor an attempt on ttie five
niile murk. The pick-up at the end of four
laps by the Jallus was most prettily made, not
a fifth of a second being lost. Michael yelled
for faster pace, but Eck cautioned the men to
hold it steady, and steady it was.
The second mile was ridden in 1:53, mak
ing the time for the distance 3 :3B 'J-5, over
three seconds outside of the record. The third
mile was faster than the second, the flgur.s
for the three miles being 5:30 1-5. two-tifths
of a second shy of the record. Then the sextu
plet came out again and tne fourth mile was
made in 1:50 4-5, bringing the four-mile
record irom 7:24 2-5, where Tom Liuton left
it, to 7:21 flat. Every one save tne officials
was excited by this time, and tho chances for
getting the mark were excellent. The last
mile, including the pick-up, was made in
1 :51 3-5, making the total time 9:12 3-5.
President Sterling of the San Francisco
Road Club is making an active light for
A. W. Wehe of his club lor chairman of
the board of governors of the associated
clubs, and will probably be successful, as
Mr. Wehe is well known and very popular
with the wheelmen and would 'make an
efficient officer.
The news that the Market-street Rail
way Company contemplated putting an
attachment on the rear dashboard of all
its cars and then carrying bicycies for a
fare, as exclusively told in The Call yes
terday, was the subject of a great deal of
comment among the wheelmen yester
day. They were all pleased with the idea,
and while few of the clubmen expressed
the thoueht that they would ever take ad
vantage of the innovation, preferring to
ride the basalt blocks, asphalt and cable
siots in the level districts, still for those
who live in hilly parts of the town and
for ladies and gentlemen who are not ex
pert riders, or do not care to riiie through
the City's streets, it will be a i;reat con
venience. Such a move, too, would go a
great way toward healing the breach be
tween the corporation and the wheeling
public, which has existed ever since that
memorable bicycle parade on July 25,
when the company ran its cars on Market
street and disrupted the turnout, regard
less of a request and a promise not to do
so. Spaldinq.
VARSITY GRIDIRONS.
Prospects for tho Thanksgiving
Matchâ Rellance-Olym pic.
Only five days remain before the sturdy
knights ot the gridiron at the State Uni
versity will meet the brawn and muscle
from Stanford in the sixth annual inter
collegiate football championship match of
the Pacific Coast. On next Thursday aft
ernoon will be broken the spell ot anxiety
and suspense that has held the students
and partisans of these two educational in
stitutions since the close of the last
Thanksgiving game and that has been
growing and growing in intensity every
day for weeks. No sooner, however, than
tbe umpire has called "time" and the
great contest of 1896 has come to a close
than thoughts of the next year's battle
and its result will be born and cherished.
"Three tie games and two defeats are
enough," say the Berkeley men, "and we
will win this year or die in the effort.' 1
The Sianford Btudents say : "Stanford
has never yet been beaten by Berkeley at
football, and our Varsity shall hold the
championship that has been ours for five
successive years."
Considerable betting on the result of the
game is said to be going on, with odds in
favor of Stanford, all the way from 5 to 4
to 2to 1. Other bets are being taken with
the same odds in favor of Berkeley.
As in the past, the Stanford students
are doing little betting themselves. They
are not a betting class. One enthusiast,
however, is known to have over $600 in
Stanford money deposited in bank here,
awaiting California backers at even money.
Nothing but unwise partisantsm on either
side would offer odds, for the records of
past years show these universities to be
more evenly matched in football than any
other two "rival institutions in America",
and the chances this year are not strongly
either way.
The teams which will play on Thurs
day, though they have not been officially
announced on either side, are practically
selected now.
Berkeley has a light but active line.
Her center is less experienced and skillful
and considerably lighter thtÂ»n Williams of
Stanford, but is well supported oy the
guards. They, too, are lighter than the
Stanford men and are not the equals of
either Captain Fickert, who now strips at
193 pounds, or of the agile Carle, who
stripped yesterday at the remarkable
weight of 214 pounds. Carle was slightly
hurt a few days since, but is himself again.
What sort of a big man he is may be in
ferred from the fact that although he ir
the heaviest man at Stanford be is one of
the best gymnasts and can turn air springs
with ease.
Simpson, one of Berkeley's tackles, is
superior to his Stanford opponent. At the
other tackle Stanford will probably have
a slight advantage in experience and
skill.
"Both universities think that at ends
they will be weaker than their oppo
nents. It is safe to saytthat they are a
standoff. Stanford's ends are their Varsity
pitcher and catcher oi last year â McLaine
and Jeffsâ no less Straight should regain
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1896.
the right end position, from which be was
only recently displaced by McLaine, a
very late arrival on the gridiron.
Stanford's line as- a whole is undoubt
edly, as far as material goes, far superior
to Berkeley's.
As to the backs, there seems to be no
question that Berkeley is decidedly the
better off. Stanford men themselves con
cede this. Tne weakness of the Stanford
team lied first in the work of her half
backs, who do not yet act in spÂ«edy con
cert witb each other in interference and in
bucking up a line attack.
Murphy, the Stanford quarter, will
probably prove a surprise m upsetting
Ransome's kicking, la every feature o?
play, except in interference, he is superior
to Kennedy of Berkeley. He is the best
general Stanford has ever had, punts with
considerable accuracy and runÃ well with
the ball.
He is strong on heeling and catching
punts under good protection from big
Cotton, the full back, who does not himself
attempt to kick. For a puat the Stanford
center snaps him the ball clean back ten
yards, where he may kick under cover of
all tho other backs.
Should the day be rainy and the ground
be slippery Stanford, with her heavy line
bucking qualities, should carry off tl c
palm, but if it is a clear day and the
eround tenable Berkeley, with her swift
runners and clever dodgers back of the
line, stands a good chance of winning.
Though the heavy smashing and buck
ing work of the training season has al
ready been done, and the men are now
putting on their "fini.shiug touches,"
something may yet arise which will
change the entire situation and complete
ly turn the balance. Never is a iootball
captain or coach certain of who will take
a place on the team until he actually sees
him on the field. Only within the last
three days has Berkeley's ;eam under
gone a decided transformation.
On Tnursday Avery was removed from
center, and Carr put in that place;
Castlehun, on account of a lame shoulder,
was laid off the team Irom his position at
guard; Ludlow was removed from tackle
to the vacant place at guard ; and Sted
ruan was uut in at tackle to fill Ludlow's
place. There has been a hard tight for
end at Berkeley, and the candidates for
the position have narrowed down to Mc-
Nntt. Craig and Hopper.
The positions on the Stanford team still
open to keen competition are left half,
tackle and right end. but the other places
are doubtless permanently filled. Dole,
Searight, Freeman and Parker are aspi
rants for left half, with chances perhaps in
the order named. Parker is the quickest
man and is compact and strong. Free
man is large, powerful, a long-distance
punter and a good line-bucker, but slow
at starting. Searight and Dole are pretty
equally matched, both in ability and in
failings.
For tackle there is some doubt whether
big Thomas and Harrington can hold their
places against Rice, who is much lighter
i ban either but is a far more skillful and
experienced tackle, and knows more foot
ball. At right end Straight, so far as
work and tiaining go, deserves the place,
but may be supplanted by McLaine, who,
though he carao out at the last moment,
has shown up very well.
A week ago things looked rather gloomy
for BerKeley, because three of the four last
year's Varsity players who are on this
year's team were disabled. Ransome and
Hutchinson were going about on crutches
and Sherman was confined to his room.
Hutchinson, the star end, is out of it
altogether this year, his ankle not having
recovered sufficiently to permit him to
enter even for a short time. But Ran
some and Sherman are both on the field
again and botli will enter the big game.
Ransome's inability to practice puntine
has been a serious setback. Berkeley has
no other man for the place, and with no
kicker she would lose to Stanford much of
an advantage.
At Palo Alto there are several men at
the pre.ent time who are outpunting him,
and if the two team 3 played to-day the
Palo Alto men would perhaps make steady
gains on exchange kicks. Hall, the Berke
ley left half, has been playing steadily
through the season and appears to be aa
free from injuries to-day as he was the
afternoon he put on his suit for the first
time.
He has been particularly fortunate in
escaping serious bangs and bruises, and,
consequently, has had all the advantages
of playing steadily throughout the prac
tice season. Kennedy, at quarter, seems
recently to have lost his cunning in mak
ing passes with tbe ball, and as a conse
quence his work for the last two or three
weeks has failen off considerably.
Avery, who has been playing at center
for the past ten days, having succeeded
Birdsall, was not near up to Varsity form,
and consequently was laid off a day or so
ago to give room for Carr, who is" much
more active and a harder player.
Ludlow, who has been moved back and
forth from tackle to guard and from guard
to tackle several times during the season,
is finally settled at guard, where he will
probably play next Thursday.
Greisberg, at left guard, has been hold
ing down his position throughout the sea
son, and has been moved about less than
any other on the line, save Simpson.
Stedrnan, who is Berkeley's rig . t tackle
at present, is a comparatively new man at
the game, and especially at the position
he is playing. Though having done good
work on the second eleven, he has not
shone out as brilliantly as some of the
other members of the team.
He is tall and sinewy and strikes the
line hard, but does not use his head well
enough. Simpson, the other Berkeley
tackle, on whom so much was counted
last year, but who was debarred at tfie
eleventh hour from playing because*of
the study requirement clause in the inter
collegiate agreement, has been out stead
ily and has made a good name for him
self, but his work has not been up to what
it was in 1895.
There is much uncertainty as to who
will play at ends. The two places lie be
tween three menâ Hopper. McNutt and
Craig -and as they all have shown up
equally well the choice will probably be
made of the two men who are in the best
physical condition.
The last days' practice at Berkeley have
been given up almost entirely to defensive
play. The "college" or second eleven has
been given tbe ball most of the time, and
has succeeded many times in making long
advances and in scoring touchdowns.
Many of the Berkeley Varsity men fail
to keep their eyes on the ball. In almost
every fumble the pigskin bag nas been
fallen upon by the "college" players.
So far as Berkeley is concerned the spec
tators on Thanksgiving day next may ex
pect to see four or five players running in
hot haste down the field, closely protect
ing the man with the ball, rather than be
holding a lone player hugging the pigskin
bag and sprinting with all his might and
main, only to be brought down by a cor
don of tackier? fr>>m the other side.
Several surprises are in store for the
Palo Alto team. Butterworth and Nott
have recently been teaching their men
several plays that have never before been
tried on this coast in an intercollegiate
game. These plays have been used with
telling effect lately. First the Varsity
eleven would try them and would make
iong advances through the college team
at every pass of the ball. When things
were reversed the college eleven would go
through the Varsity line in like manner.
The greatest secrecy has been observed
regarding these SDeciaJ plays. They have
been carried on almost altogether in the
gymnasium entirely screened from the
public gaze.
Stanford also has some "good things"
in store and still has on stock several tell
ing trick plays, taught by Walter Camp,
but never yet attempted in a big game.
But on her line's ability to hold and to
break stronely and break up interfer
ences Stanford is relying a great deal,
and with reason.
The Berkeley men have new blue and
gold sweaters, which had been knitted
especially for them. These sweaters are
made after a new design and resemble,
with their broad blue and gold stripes,
very much the striking green and gold
sweaters of the University of Vermont
players.
Berkeley will be well supplied with mas
cots at the game this year. Two little
California bears, captured in the Sierras,
and "Spud" Murphy, an urchin of 10
seasons, who has won much fame for him
self among the players at the U. C, wiii
serve as a talisman. They will all be
gayly decked with yards of blue and gold
ribbons.
Yesterday morning over twenty-five of
the Stanford fooiballsquad, together with
Coach Cross and Assistant Coaches Clem
ona and Downing, took up quarters at
Congress Spring, near Los Gatos, where
the men will rusticate until Thursday
BERKELEY'S THREE MASCOTS.
morning. They will have their last hard
practice to-day, and after that, signals and
quick movements in going through the
Diays will be the chief practice while the
men freshen up for the supreme struggle.
Central Park will have seats for 16,000
persons for the great game.
This afternoon Reliance and Olympic
meet again on the Central Park gridiron
to settle the question of this season's ath
letic club football championship, left un
decided by the 4 to 4 tie game of last Sat
urday. The management, profiting by the
experience of las-t Saturday, has wisely
done away with the dollar admission and
gone back to the old and more popular
price.
Carl Clemans, Stanford's old star half
back, who is now helping to coach the
Stanford Varsity at Congress Springs, is
to be married at Woodland next Wednes
day, the day before the great Thanks
giving game. The bride to De is Miss
Alberta Merritt, a graduate of Stanford of
the class of '95. The match had its origin
in college in the days when Clemana was
the bero of the hour.
THE BOXERS.
Olympic Club Will Give a Profes
sional Entertainment In January.
In another department of The Call will
be found a description of last evening's
fistic entertainment at Woodwards Pa
vilion.
The Olympic Club, although a little
Dick Wheaton of Los AngelesJ
Who Will Box Jack Davis.
slow in arranging for a professional fistic
exhibition, has finally decided to hold a
first-class entertainment at the pavilion
some time in January. Leader Howard
Taylor and Superintendent William Ken
nedy have been authorized by the direc
tors to ao ahead and secure the best talent
obtainable at a small figure. The club
should not make any mistake in matching
fighters, because if it engages any other
than first-class men of prominence it need
not hope for favorable results.
The contest of last evening between two
famous professionals and the contest
looked for December 2 between two noted
heavy-weights will very materially lessen
the ardor of those who have a fancy for
fisticuffs, therefore it behooves the match
makers of the club to use good judgment
in selecting talent. George Lavigne is
certainly the next best drawing card to
Fitzsimmons and those in his class. If a
first - class man were selected to meet
Lavigne in a ten-round contest a good
crowd would certainly witness the mill;
or it Sharkey should make a good stand
against Fitzsimmons a contest between
him and Peter Maher would attract a
large gathering of sport-lovers. But if
the Olympic Club is of the opinion that
because of its popularity and renown a
crowd will flock to witness any entertain
ment held under its auspices there may be
many surprised Olympians when the pro
ceeds of the entertainment are made pub
lic.
The sporting people of to-day do not
take much stock in the clubs under whose
auspices pugilistic contests are held. They
look at the game announced, and if they
conclude that it will prove worth seeing
they will patronize the sport.
The following excellent programme has
been arranged by the Excelsior Club for a
boxing entertainment which will be held
next Friday evening, the proceeds of
which will be handed over to old Jack Da
vis, who will make his last appearance in
the ring:
Four-round boutsâ A. Pontages and P.
McCabe; Jack Knight and Ben Lewis of
Stockton. Tom Cooney of Boston will
box Joe buliivan of this City eight rounds.
Ihe windup wiil be a ten-iound contest
between Jack Davis and Dick W heaton of
Los Angeles.
A decision will be given in every con
test. *
The committee of arrangements consists
Â°| John Crowley, Dick McCreadie, J.
Gibbs, F. D. Muliin and J. W. Soutner.
Chief of Police Crowley, Detective Lees
and other prominent officials will visit
ritzsimmons to-morrow at his training
quarters. The famous pugilist will give
an exhibition of fancy bag-punching, atter
which he will spar with his trainers,
Hickey and Stelzner. Several members
of the Pacific Yacht Club will also be pres
ent to see how Fitz can handle his dukes
in play.
GUN AND GAME.
Flrst-Class Duck ShootlngrCan Now
Be Hadâ Up In a Balloon.
Now the sportsmen are in the swim.
| Wild ducks are plentiful everywhere and
large numbers of "green heads," "black
heads," "baldies" and in fact all colors of
heads have been brought to bag since the
arrival of the storm.
Hunters who have been "drawing
beads" on tne quacJters of the Alviso
marshes during the week report having
had excellent shooting. Saturday W.
Thomas, Edwin Jones and Jack Fowler
returned from Alviso with a strine of 125
birds, all of when were killed on Wednes
day near the bay shore. Among the num
ber were canva^back, sprig and mallard
but teal predominated.
Local sportsmen who shoot in the So
nonia marshes and who have "shanties'"'
in the vicinity of Sears Point state that
the market hunters have destroyed the
shooting of the sportsmen of this City, as
they keep up a fusillade on the ducks all
days of the week excepting Sundays, and
as a consequence the birds are wild and
will not decoy. A delegation of hunters
who piuronize the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railroad will visit the
president of the company next week for
the purpose of devising" some plan of
checking tbe slaughter of ducks b7 hunters
who shoot solely for the market. The local
hunters contend that if the company will
object to ship game over its line unless
the owners of such game accompany it,
the market hunters' vocation will very
soon cease. Certainly unless some restric
tions are placed on those who hunt for the
market, local sportsmen will be forced to
seek other and better quarters within easy
distance of the City.
Those who make duck shooting a
business should go south, where wild
game is very plentiful and where sports
men who shoot for pleasure are compara
tively few.
Members of the Ibis, Cordelia and Teal
shooting clubs have been enjoying grand
sport in the Suisun marshes during the
past week. Wild ducks of all kinds are
now very plentiful in the up river country,
and sportsmen have no just cause for
complaint.
William J. Ahem, president of the
Sportsmen's Protective Association, has
thrown a light on the mysterious balloon
or aerial flying ship that was seen passing
over the city of Sacramento one night
recently. vVhile conversing with some
members of the association last evening,
Mr. Ahem incidentally remarked that it
would not be many moons when local
sportsmen will have an opportunity of
shooting wild game without committing a
trespass or passing under huge signs
notifying hunters to keep off the mud.
"Now this balloon business is all right,"
remarked tbe eagle-eyed president, "ana
what a surprise we will i ive the Cordelia
Club boys when we will anchor our flying
ship over a favorite canvasback pond and
commence pumping lead on the backs of
those delicious birds.
"I can assure you, gentlemen, that we
will get around tne law all right unless
the Supreme Court decides that the air
immediately over the lands of the pre
serve clubs is private property. Of course
in that event we might just as well give
up all idea of shooting, but we wiil wait
and see how matters go. This airship is
all right, but lam not at liberty to state
anything concerning the flying puzzle un
til the machine is adjudged perfect by the
inventor."
A grand turkey shoot open to all comers
will be held to-morrow at the San Bruno
House. An abundance of splendid birds
will bo on hand and good sport is prom
ised those who will attend.
The following letter from Salem, Or. is
self-explanatory :
Â^.b ^ a , t November 1 the statement was pub
lished in the Oregon press that eleven profes
sional hunters had this season killed fully
1000 deer in the Elk Creek and Rogue Biver
country, lying across the line of Douglas and
Jackson counties, this State. According to
this statement the men kilted these numbers ie-
Bpectively : 200, 150, 123, 125. 150 125 30 I<>
and 100 to three other men. These numbers
were only casually mentioned to impress one
with the belief that deer were numerous, but
it was said fully twice that number had been
ki led by hunters. These deer were killed
solely for market.
Words fail oue to comment on a state of af
fairs like this. Too much cannot be said on
the subject, and yet what can be done to stoD
such slaughter? r
What a comparison could be drawn between
the States ot the Atlantic and the Pacific
coasts. In the former, with a puny handful of
deer, every effort is made to protect them.
Here, with almost countless numbersâ as yetâ
it seems the history of the buffalo will be re
peated.
A New York sportsman sends the fol
lowing plan to measure length of gun
stocks. He says:
Hold the forearm at right angles to the up
per arm and measure from inside of elbow to
first joint of trigger finger, and the distance
In inches will be the length of stock required.
Another plan is to hold the arm in the same
position, place the butt of the gun in the bend
of the arm, and if the trigger finger is In the
right place for pressing the trigger thÂ« stock
will be the proper length.
A party of well. known sportsmen re
turned last Sunday night from Belmont
after enjoying three days' rare sport lat
duck hunting. The party consisted of M.
McNeil, P. Hanson, F. Knoblncu, P. H E
Steiner. H. Danger.-L. Corraine, J. Bank
H. Fremont and J. Bacher.
They hired a schooner and sailed away
from the wharf at Fourth and Berry
streets on Thursday night. The vessel
was well stocked with provisions and
drinkables and they expected a good time
They were not disappointed.
The birds were not very plentiful, but
they managed to bring home about twelve
dozen. That was exclusive ofthe number
they consumed during the three days
which was very large, owin* to the skill
ful cooking of Corraine, with the able as
sistance of Knobloch.
The trip was not without its incidents
and accidents. The first day they had
scarcely rowed away from the schooner
when they sighted a flock of ducks In
his anxiety Bacher leaned back, following
the flock with his guv, till he lost his bal
ance and tumbled a somersault into tbe
water. He was fished out with consider
able difficulty and did not recover hts
spirits for the rest oi that day. On Satur
day Danger got stuck in the mud. He
tried repeatealy to extricate himself, and
then he yelled for help. He was so firmly
imbedded in tho mud that a rope had to
be tied between his legs and under his
armpits, and it took the strength of the
other eight to pull him out.
WITH THE OARSMEN.
Preparations for the Big Thanks
giving Rearatta.
The rowing clubs of this City and the
interior are making great preparations in
anticipation of the Thanksgiving day re
gatta.
The entry list up to the present time is
unusually large. The leading oarsmen of
the State have signified their intention of
participating, and there is no doubt that
the regatta will be the best that the State
has ever bad.
Valuable prizes have been offered for
the different events by James G. Phelan,
William Alvord, William D. English,
Irving M. Scott, William A. Deane, Au
ditor Broderick and the Southern Paciiic
Company.
The Aiameda Rowing Club will enter a
splendid crew for. the intermediate race.
The South Ends have kindly loaned them
the boat "Blister." The crew is as follows:
(1) Eugene Hadcock, (2) William Hansen,
(3) A. Webb, Fred Ayrea stroke, and E. V.
Hansen cockswain.
Under the skillful coaching of Mr. Pem
broke, they are dt yeloping a good strong
stroke. ' Dr. Dennis wiil enter the senior
skiff race, and Eugene Hadcock and J. A.
Lewis the junior skiff race. It is also
expected that the club will furnish a police
boat to patrol the course.
The Stockton Kowing Club has entered
its giants in the senior four-oared barge
race. They are: (1) C. Spencer, (2)
George W. Chapman, (3) Carl (Trilby)
Davis, W. E. Dolen cockswain and J. Par
rott substitute.
Captain A. G. Brown, who defeated Me-
Causland on the 9th of September, has en
tered the senior shell race. He bas Mc-
Cansland to row against, and an exciting
struggle is looked for.
J. Foley has entered the junior shell
race, and will give a good account of him
self. The men will come down to the
City a day before the race so as to become
familiar with the course.
There is a rumor that the Stockton
people have put $5000 in the hands of a
representative to back the giants and
Brown.
Through the kindness of J. H. Budd of
Stockton, the University Club will enter,
as he has promised to h ye a boat for
them, their boat being too heavy for rac
ing purposes. The crew is as follows:
(1) R. Tryer, (2) W. Gibbons, (3) W. O.
Blasingame, (4) W. E. Cole; E. Hammer,
cockswain. Captain Cole has worked hard
to bring the crew to the front, and they
expect to be close up at the finish.
Arthur Smith is entered for the junior
skiff.
The old-timers' race will prove one of
the most interesting races of the day. It
will be a race in skiffs for a mile straight
away. The entries are Leander Stevenson
of the Ariel 9, William Thomas of the
South Ends, and John F. Suliivan of the
Pioneers. There is a great deal of rivalry
existing between Afr. Stevenson and Mr.
Thomas. Both gentlemen are now coach
ing rival clubs.
Tha Dolphins have entered T. J. Ken
nedy and W. O. Patch for the junior skiff
and T. R. Keenan for the junior scull.
Jack Cau^hlin, the club's crack swim
mer, will give a good account of himself
in the senior skiff race, as he is in perfect
condition.
Captain Patch wilJ try an experiment
by using a shorter oar with more inboard.
The oars weigh but 7% pounds, which is
two or three pounds les& than those gen
erally used.
The South Ends have two crews in train
ing â the senior and the intermediate.
The senior crew won the intermediate
championship at Stockton and will give
the giants a hard race. They consist of
the following: (1) Ed Scully, (2) James
Pallas, (3) Mat Beeen, (4) George Bates;
George McGill,cockswain,and James Foley
sub. The crew has been under the care of
Captain William Thomas and has been
training faithfully for the last two weeks.
As for the intermediate crew, although
all good oarsmen, they have not been
training faithfully, and unless they show
up more regularly at the boathouse the
boys from the university will stand an
excellent chance for first place.
In the senior skiff race tbe club will
enter Frank Dupiissea, who can be seen
training every evening. He is reported to
be in good condition.
In the junior skiff the club will be repre
sented by Robert McArthur ana Mat
Breen. In this event a lively race is ex
pected, as tbe men are evenly matched.
Captain Thomas will represent the club
in the old-timers' race. He has been
training for the past three weeks and is
in excellent condition.
On next Monday Mr. Pembroke and
Colonel Menton and a surveyor will go
over the course and measure it so as to
have a record-course.
The officers of the day are as follows:
President of the day, Mayor-elect James
G. Phelan; referee, Charles G. Yale;
starter, Admiral yon Schmidt; timer
John Elliott. At start Walter Blake and
Artie Mellitz and at finish Leander Ste
venson and George Collopy.
Furtner entries will be made on Monday
next.
Handball:
The rainy weather will not deter the
lovers of handball from attending the
games that will be played to-morrow in
Ryan's covered court, 858 Howard street.
The programme is as follows:
P. Kelley and J. McEvely vs. J. Slattery and
C. Sullivan; Doc Molloy and T. Sullivan vs. J

United States Paymaster George H.
Griffin will depart to-day for Washington.
He has been in charge of the navy pay
office in this City for the past three years.
Paymaster Griffin has no knowledge as to
where he will next be assigned for duty.
He will be succeeded in office by Pay In
spector Edward Bellows, who has been
stationed at the League Island office
Philadelphia. Inspector Bellows is ex
pected to arrive in this City within a day
or two. He comes highly recommended
as an efficient officer. Mr. Griffin, the re
tiring officer, has been in the service for
over twenty years, and he has gained for
himself many friends in military and so
cial circles in this City.

WAS CHALLENGED
Bias and Prejudice Charged
in the Indictment of
â¢ . Marriott.
Robert Haight's Explanation of
â¢ " a Jocular Conversation on
the Street.
Membsrs of the Jnry Test.fied That
They Were Governed by Motives
â¢of Honesty and Justic;.
The Grand Jury yesterday listened to a
statement from Police Judge Conlan and
immediately ignored charges brought
against him by Mr. Lubeck, a client of At
torney LowenthaJ. Lubeck was jolted on
the hand by a revolver in tbe hands of one
Nathan. Tbe case was taken to Judge
Conlan's court and postponed four times,
it was on the calendar to be called last Sat
urday, but the matter was brought to the
attention of the Grand Jury the day be
fore. When it was called up in court the
day after Lubeck and Lowenthal were be
iore'the Grand Jury the latter asked for
'snother postponement. Judge Conlan
stated to the jury that the case was post
poned twice by consent of both parties;
postponed the third time because it was
set without the consent of the court for a
special hour which interfered with other
business; aud postponed the fourth time
by request of the complaining witness. In
v;ew of this statement, verified by the
â¢record, the Grand Jury fully exonerated
Judge Oonlan.
The Grand Jury was summoned to Judge
Dain pern" eld's court to answer certain '
questions. In tne case of the People vs.
Fred Marriott for libeling Judge Uebbard,
the defendant moved for dismissal of the \
.proceedings on the ground that certain j
members of the Grand jury were governed
by bias and prejudice in finding the indict
ment. Thirteen jurors accused of preju
dice were called. Mr. Darwin represented
the defendant. Julius Kann and Assistant
District Attorney Peixotto atked questions j
for the people.
Juror Robert Haight's examination was '
amusing. It seems that he met Percy |
Goldstone in front of the Spreckels build- '.
â ing last Thursday and in an off-hand fash- !
ion'im parted to that young man his views j
about newspaper libels and the degree of
punishment wnich should be meted out to
newspaper offenders. He was not aware
then that tne youth with whom he was
talking was an attache of the^ews-Letter,
the paper whose editor was indicted for
libel on Judge Hebbard.
Mr. Haight, replying to questions pro
pounded by Ben Darwin, said: "I do not
know the defendant, not even by sight. I
did not say that an}* newspaper man
ought to be sent to San Quentin. "Did not
â¢ay that any newspaper man who would
libel Judge Hebbard ought to be sent to
State prison. Yes; I had a conversation
in front of the Spreckels building with
Percy Goidatone, but Judge Hebbard' s
name was not mentioned. I had a jocular
conversation with Goldstone. He said to
me, 'Why did you indict my boss?' and I
replied: 'He ougbt to have been killed
instead of indictej.' it was a jocular con
versation.
Darwin â To whom did you refer when
you said he ought to have been killed?
Haigbt â Why, the newspaper man.
Mr. Haignt, resuming the narrative of
his talk with Goldstone, testified:
"I said a newspaper had no more right
than an individual to assail private char
acter. Yes, I said I had once been at
tacked in the Chronicle, and I regarded
the crime of libel as next to that of mur
der."
Darwinâ Did you not say that a man
should be seat to prison a thousand years
for libei?
Haightâ l do not remember having
made such a statement.
Darwinâ Did you not say that Judge
Hebbard ought to have taken a gun?
â¢ Haight â What I said was that if I was
on a jury I would not vote to convict a
rnan.wfio had killed a newspaper man be
cause of libel.
.Replying io questions by Mr. Peixotto
tiie witness said:
. "In finding the indictment I was guided
oniy by the evidence. I did not know the
defendant."
Juror C. C. Burr testified that he had no
prejudice against the defendant.
I >af winâ Did not the News- Letter some
â¢years ago expose you in regard to baking
powder?
â¢ lJurrâ This is the tirst I have heard of it.
I did not know it. It is all news to me. I
thought only of public justice in voting oil
the indictment.
G.rand Juror W. L. Ashe testified tnnt
.he did not know the defendant person
ally. -He was guided by a desire to attain
justice. "I never had any prejudice
aeainst the News-Letter. I never ad
mired- the paper particularly, but that
â would not impei me to indict tha editor
Without cause.
â¢ â¢William P. Man, H. S. Hagan, E. P.
Parnsworth, M. Spiro, Frederick Hobbs,
David B. Faktor, A. E. Drucker and Fred
erick W. Zehius testified that they ha 4no
bias or prejudice against the defendant.
Mr. Darwin did not areue the motion
to dismiss on tbe ground of Grand Jury
bias, and Judge Daingerheld at once
denied the motion.
After the incident in Judge Dainger
field's court the Grand Jury went to
Judge Slack's court and filed indictments
â¢for perjury against J. P. Smith and Paul
A. Ayhens. These refer to the election
ca^es, and are not new indictments in a
proper sense, but are former indictments
amended in order to avoid a technical ob
jection in the Superior Court.
For an hoar prior to adjournment the
jury considered a number of propositions,
and sent a communication to the Board of
Supervisors.
- One topic under consideration was the
inadequate facilities for extinguishing
fires on the water front. It is said that the
Underwriters are serene in the belief
that tbe fireboats are properly manned
and equipped as an auxiliary of the regu
lar Fire Department, when the fact is taat
the boats are not serviceable owing to a
controversy between the Chief of the Fire
Department and the Harbor Commis
sioners. Several members of the Grand
Jury entertain the opinion that the Har
bor' Commissioners are in tbe wrong. In
order to secure adequate protection an
effort will be made to adjust the differ*
eiicea.
. The Grand Jury will hold a special ses
sion next Wednesday afternoon. There
is rumor to the effect that the jury will
inquire concerning the value of land on
Mission street, on which it is proposed to
erect a High Bcbooi-
WILMERDING SCHOOL.
Who Will Donate a Sit* and Building
for the New Instita
-1 tlon ?
\ The following request offers an oppor
tunity for some philanthropic person to
come forward and donate a site and build
ing lor the Wilmerding School, to be
established in this City:
. Offici of the Merchants' Association,)
Mills Building, >
_Â â San Francisco, Nov. 20. 1896. >
To tlu. Editor of The < all : A rare opportunity
ior lame now awaits some patriotic citizen.
Through the philanthropy of J. Ciute Wilnier
ding, one of our notable pioneer merchants,
there has been bequeathed to San Francisco a
tcnool of industrial arts, where our boys shall
be trained "to earn a living with little study
and plenty of work." The endowment with
interest amounts to $425,000. This sum will
be ample for the conduct and maintenance of
a great trade institution, but is not sufficient
also to buy a suitable site and buildinsr.
Who will be the fortunate citizen to come for
ward at this critical moment and supplement
this noble endowment with a wormy slte7
Where is the blg-nearted patriot in our midst
who will now offer a plain building to com
plete this munificentKift? The site need not
be vast or costly. It should be located near
the foundries, mills and workshops of thi City,
as close as possible to the homes of most of our
poorbovs. The building need not be elegant
or expensive. A RUbstantial brick or stone
structure with capacity for varied machinery
will fully answer the purpose. A large lot
valued at say $50,000, and a building for hall
thai sum are sufficient to give immediate me
to this new School of Industrial Arts.
No city on earth contains proportionately
more wealth than San Francisco. Many ot our
rich men and women are justly noted for their
generous deeds. Here is an opportunity _to
achieve more than passing memory. The
names of Lie*. Hastings, Stanford, Cooper and
Tolandare enrolled upon the eternal scroll of
fame. With the loitiest inspiration they
erected imperishable monuments to their
names.
The Wilmerding School of Industrial Arts
will give the poor boys of California a chance
to enter upon a useful and honorable career.
It is not to the few favored sons of fortune that
the commonwealth must look for strength and
stability. The late of the Republic rests upon
the industry and contentment of the common
people. Therefore, this School of Industrial
Arts means not only the welfare of the poor
boys of California, but also the progress and
prosperity of our country.
Pioneers of San Francisco, native sons of
California, whom fortune has favored, this is
your chance for fame! Think of the incalcu
lable blessings the gift of this modest site and
buildings will shower upon posterity 1 Re
member that none are so grateful as those
whose hands have been taught how best to
earn their daily bread. The far-seeing citizen
who will now come forward to join Wiimerd
ing's munificence will ever share with him the
honor and fame of founding a school of indus
trial arts that will surely prove the nucleus of
one of the greatest colleges of trades in the
world's history.

IDEALS OF ETERNITY.
Interesting Friday Night Talk by Rabbi
Voorsanger in the Temple
J-iuanu-Kl.
Rabbi Voorsanger delivered a Friday even
ing talk at tbe Temple Emanu-El, his subject
being "The Story of the Ideal of Eternal Life
in the Two Great Religions." Beiore he spoke
upon this theme he extended a cordial invita
tion to all those present and to the general
public to attend Thanksgiving services at the
rpmple. He also announced that be would de
liver the last of the series of Friday night
; taUs next week, when he would take for his
1 theme "Ideuls of Humanity Applied to God."
The ideal of eternal life, Rabbi Voorsanger
! raid, was the oldest ideal of humanity. It
was coexistent with the dawn of civilization
and wiih tbe aawn of human intelligence.
The mural inscriptions of antiquity showed
this to be the fact. All nations had harbored
tbe ideal oi eternal life.
It was possible that the ideal was begotten
{ like any otner ideal, through contact of the
! actual with the theoretical. Man had not
i been able to penetrate into the mysteries of
'â  the future. No man could come before an an
; dience ot intelligence with absolute testimony
i concerning the continuance of tnis existence,
but all men have heid continued existence to
be actual.
Every cultured nation, without exception,
had rebuked materialism. Wise rabbis have
heid that the future state will be like Adam's
before his tallâ one of sinlessness and inno
cence. It could not be saia that either Juda
ism or Christianity originated the ideal of
eternal life.
Judaism was a purely contemplative re
ligion. The Scriptures had no allusion di
rectly to eternal life, not bad they put into
;orm a localized heaven or bell. Such ideas
were contraiy to ancient Judaism. Sheol was
only a poetical expression to describe the
grave. Ancient Hebrews had rather vague
ideas. Hebrew clergymen to-day had the ad
vantage of Christian clergymen in not claim
ing to know anything about tortures of Ge
henna. -
No man could determine the application of
Providence to conditions which man cannot
comprehend. There was nothing that could
be more destructive of the peace of the
world than for any creed or reHgion to assume
to open tbe gates of eternal life io only those
who accepted a particular interpretation.
There could be no greater insolence than io
reiuse access to the face of God to all except
ing those of a particular form of belief. Jesus
had learned the doctrine of eternal life from
llxe rabbis.
Finally Rabbi Voorsanger drew a vivid pic
ture in the words of Socrates, holding tbe cup
of hemlock in his band and saying;, "If I did
not know \vh. re 1 am going 1 would lament."
The congregation was large.
PROPOSED LA BOR LAWS.
Trades Organizations 'Will Ilndeavor
to Have Amendments Inserted
in the Code.
Final action will be taken at tbe next meet
ing of the California labor convention by
which the laborers will be benelitc-d by enact
ments of tbe Legislature.
The following is a brief synopsis of the
amendments which will come before tne con
vention for final action:
Bill 11, remitting cost of suit in Justices'
courts to persons suing for wages due; bill
12, to prevent collusion with employment
agents; bill 13, to prohibit employment of
other than citizens on publis work: Dill 15,
to provide for proper boiler inspection; bill
16, to avoid delay Jn payment of wages due
persons discharged from service.
Bill 19, providing for a mechanics' lien law;
bill 20, recommenuiiig the reoeal of the poll
tax; bill '21, recommendiug tne changing of
Labor day to the first Monuav in SeptemLer;
bill 22, amendment to bill 725: bill 28, a bill
to furnish all textbooks in primary and gram
mar grades of public schools free to al. pupils.
In response to tbe invitation issued to tbe
Senators and Assemblymen elected in this
City, four of the five Senators elected signed,
siii'i twelve of the eighteen Assemblymen for
the Legislature elected signed to do all that
lies in iheir power to have these amendments
passed.
An additional precaution was taken at the
meeting of the Labor Council last night to see
that no objectionable laws should creep into
the codes being prepared by the Code Com
missioners, who are now codifying the laws of
tue State. To guard against this the law and
legislative committee was instructed to look
after the work of the Commissioners. The
same committee was instructed to draft a bill
to be added to the State laws regarding the
"Referendum" clause, which has been a topic
of discussion with the Popuiist party for some
time. '
V\ . Macarthur, J. Hill and E. C. Hawkes were
appointed irom the couucil to attend the labor
convention as delegate*.
Tbe shinglem are making active prepara
tions for their first ball, wbicu will be held at
927 Mission street to-night.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1896.
DOCKERY'S HEAD
IS IN DANGER
A Suit Begun Yesterday
to Oust Him From
His Office.
[f This Is Not Successful the
Matter Will Go to the
Grand Jury.
Charges That He Conspired to Black
mail Dairymen Which Cannot
Be Suppressed.
It is evident that the end is not yet in
the matter of the charges against J. P.
Dockery, the chief food inspector of the
Board of Health, in spite of the efforts of
the board to shield him.
Christian Ruhland and Karl Zimmer
man, proprietors of the Richmond Dairy,
have instituted proceedings to ouat the
inspector from office on the ground that
he and Market Inspector Davis attempted
to levy blackmail to tbe extent of $600.
The complaint is drawn by Attorney M.
M. F.stee and sets forth "that on or about
the Ist day of October, 1896, Dockery ana
Davis combined and conspired for the
purpose of corruptly obtaining money
from these complainants; that for said
purpose Dockery approached these com
plainants and informed them that if they
would pay to Dockery and Davis $630 the
cows of complainants would not be con
demned as unhealthy or unfit for the
production of pure milk; but that they
would be condemned unless the said sum
of $600 was paid to Dockery and Davis."
It is further avowed that afterward, on
or about Movember 6, near the northwest
corner of Third and Mission streets,
Dockery and Davis approached Zimmer
man in relation to tbe payment of tbe
$600, and that Zimmerman promised to
make a partial payment of $300 on the
9ih inst. ; that on the day agreed on, at
the same corner of Mission and Third
street", between 8 and 9 o'clock in the
morning, Dockery again met Zimmerman
and demanded the payment of the $300
promised, and that the complainants
thereupon refu-ed to pay the money.
Judge Hunt has cited Dockery to ap
pear on the 30th inst and show cause why
be should not be deprived of his effice.
This 19 the same charge now under in
vestigation before tbe local Board of
Health.
The matter came np at a special meet
ing of the board a" few days ago, and
Attorneys Estee and Rotbchild appeared
for the prosecution and stated that they
had a good ca-e against Dockery, but that
they were not prepared to go on with ibe
case, because their principal witness was
absent from tbe City.
Dr. Morse was in favor of dismissing tbe
charges without a hearing, stating that
the witnesses had had ample notice and
that they should nave been on hand.
The attorneys mentioned combated the
proposed dismissal vigorously and suc
ceeded in getting a postponement fora
we k, but the riling of the puit to oust
Docktry is evidence that they have strong
testimony to back up their action, and
they fear that to come betore the Board of
Health would be to smother tbe case be
fore a fair hearing can be had. They pre
fer to have the testimony of the witnesses
against Dockery heard in open court, so
that it cannot be suppressed in secret
session, as was the case in the investiga
tion of Superintendent Weaver of the
Almsbouse.
It is understood that the attorneys for
Docktry will attempt to convince the
court that it has no jurisdiction in the
matter and will endeavor to have the
action thrown out on that ground. 6houtd
the court take Dockery's attorneys' view
of the case the matter will be placed in the
hands of tbe Grand Jury, where a thor
ough ventilation of the scandal is certain.
CARNIVAL BUTTONS.
They Have Been Placed on Saleâ Foil;

ture.
Carnival Director Friedlander has been in
structed by the executive committee of the
Carnival of the Golden Gate to proceed at once
with the organization of his forces for the
spring carnival. Friedlander has the pro
gramme well in hand, and will draw from the
committee of twenty-five such assistants as he
may require.
Carnival buttons were placed on sale yester
day in all the principal stores of the City. The
button is quite a pretty conceit, and is one of
the most elaborate ever got out in thia
City. The central figure represents Folly on h
typical California bear. Iv one baud Folly
holds aloft a bunch of purple grape.- and in
the other a horn of plenty. In the background
in a sunrise view at the Golden Gate, Fort
Point and Lime Point being fr.ithiully por
trayed. Around the circumference are the
words Carnival of the Golden Gate, printed :n
the three colors of the carnival, blue, gold and
cardinal. Under the bear are the figures
1897. The retail price of the buttons is 10
cents, and the committee hope that every one
in the City will soon be wearing one.
An Unsolicited Testimonial.
From the Democrat, Atlanta, Texas.
"being constantly asked by many of my
friends if Dr. Williams' Pink* Pills for Pale
People were doing me any good, 1 offer this
unsolicited testimonial and answer. Never
having seen a well day since I had typhoid
fever last summer. I could i eta in scarcely any
iood, my limbs and joints ached aud pained
all the time. It was misery to me to rise up in
bed and my mind was clouded, in fact, was a
physical wreck, and I lelt that my life was
drawing to a close, and I must confess It was
without regret on my part, as my bufferings
were almost unbearable.
"Since 1 commenced to take Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills, at the solicitation of my wife I
have taken four boxes, and I feel like a new
man. My appetite is good, and I now retain
what I eat; my limbs and joints are free of
pain aud I have gained ten pounds in weight.
My life feels renewed and, while not yet en
tirely well, I feel so much better that I un
hesitatingly assert that I belli ve Pink Pills
for Pale People a good medicine for what
they are recommended. Knowing that no
medicine will save life under all circum
stances or in all cases, yet I do honently be
lieve that they have prolonged mine, or at
least where all was dark and gloomy and
full of suffering It has been changed for the
better.
"The manufacturers of this medicine do not
know of my taking it. Neither am I paid for
this statement, but give it freely in answer to
friends and tbe editor of this paper.
"(Signed.) John Bacgreks, A'lanta, Tex."
Sworn to and subscribed before me this 27th
day of March, lÃ96.

Try Paine's Celery Compound, the Most Advanced Remedy
That Science Can Give.
MRS. R. R. PRATT.
There are very intelligent men and
women who still prefer open fires to steam
pipes and furnaces.
But only a very shallow-minded person
would deliberately choose an old-fashion-
ed remedy in case of sickness.
Sufferers from neuralgia, rheumatism or
kidney trouble want the surest and most
advanced remedy science can give them.
Getting well is not a matter of sentiment,
but the most seriously practical matter.
That is why the most thoughtful and con-
servative people now use Paine's celery
compound, and recommend it to friends
and relatives who are threatened or af-
flicted with nervous exhaustion, sleepless-
ness, disordered liver or blood diseases.
That wonderfully acute and patient in-
vestigator. Prof. Edward E. Phelps, M.D.,

Paine's celery compound the most pro-
gressive, yet thoroughly established, views
on the cure of diseases of nervous origin.
All of the imitators of Paine's celery
compound â every one knows how many
there are â have proved to be entirely wide
of the mark. Their promises of astonish-
ing curative abilities are easily made on
paper; but they are not kept.
It is easy to verify every claim made
by Paine's cc cry compound. There is no
village so small but it contains iamilies in
which thia wonderful remedy has made
some member well. Men who weigh their
words and who are careiui what they write
above their signatures have publicly given
tliis great invigorator its deserved credit
for health-making powers such as no other
remedy ever received.

cures such diseases as neuralgia, sleep
lessn,ess and dyspepsia does not admit of
a doubt. It builds up the entire nervous
sys:em, plumps out the tissues, starts the
biood into healthy circulation and regu-
lates the action of the nerves. It makes
people well, strong and energetic.
Mrs. R. R. Pratt of Centre Brook, Conn.,
whose portrait is given here, says plainly:
"I find Paine's celery compound a per-
fect medicine. I took several bottles f^r
general debility, and it did for me all I
could ask. It made me welL I have
recommended it to my friends, and they
all speak in its praise."
Paine's celery compound is the most as-
sured and direct means of getting back a
full store of vitality. It is a true nerve
regulator. It exterminates all vicious hu-
mors that linger in the biood. It cures
rheumatism, and is u-ei by physicians as
a specific for this disease.

"I was attacked with rheumatic fever in
its worst form. I employed the best phy-
sicians, but received no permanent relief.
When I commenced to take Paine's celery
compound my feel and hands were swollen
so badly that they were useless. I could
not walk a step and was suffering very
ranch. When I had taken four bottles of
Paine'a celery compound I could walk
well, and I continued until I took six
bottles. It made me perfectly well, and I
have been so ever since. I wish the whole
wor d might know of its great value."
Paine's celery compound makes people
well!

Explanation. 1
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures !
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It, If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredth^, â¢
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid i
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The ;
word "hleh" means high barometric pressure and 'â 
is usually accompanied by fair weather: â¢ "low" ;
refers to low pressure, and is uÂ«nally preceded â 
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. I
"Lows" us- ally first appear on the Wnshlncton :
coast. When the pressure is high In thÂ» Interior :
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable; I
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb- :
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and '
the pressure falling to the California coas'. warmer ,
weather may be expected in summer and colder |
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition* |
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK. N. V.. Nov. 20 Speculation at
the Stock Exchange was quiet, the transactions
amounting to only 175,223 shares. In this total
Reading figured for 42.300 shares, Sugar for 27.

At the ' open ng the market was weakened by a I
break in American spirits preferred of 2% per I
â¢ant to 29 and a further reduction of x, a c per
pound in r. fined sugar, which carried Sugar cer
tificates down to 11 6%. The losses in the eeneral
market were confined to narrow limits. The de
clining tendency was checked soon after the open

: : Wooir-Jacob Wollner's circular I says: '. "The
market Is better. 1 Confidence seems to he restored,
bat prices nayÂ« not raUed to any great extent. Two
or three weeks previous to the election a good deal
of outside capital was in vested' in Wool t>y people
who bad confluence in â  the 1 election of McKm ey;
and considered Wool low enough to speculate on.
We cannot say s there -Is : a lively ' demand either
here or in the Eastern markets since the election.;
One reason Is tnat holders ask more than Wool Is
.worth â on a parity â  with . European ; markets, and
some of the sellers forget that we have no tariff or
duty on Wool as yet and Kuropecan flood us with
L \V 001 T and . woolens. ' The orders '. for the woolen
mills so far have not been ; very extensive, and al
though a good many of them have been snut down
for four or five months they ' have now resumed
operations, but the orders are not plentiful. > Con
gress : convenes - next month, and ;if : the Senate
should Dais the emergency bill, called the Dlngley
bill, which passed the House at the last session
an 1 which is now before the senate, it will make a
difference of 30% to Si % on Wool and woo en goods.
It that bill noes not |ia>>s and we have to wait, until
Mr. McKinley Is Inaugurated ; and ca Is an extra
session,' Europe will have plemy lof time 10 Hood
the country with Wool and woolens, so that the
tariff will sot benefit us for 1 the next two or three
years. It all lies with . legislation. Sine? the elec
tion we nave bad Bales at Red BluftVUlciah, Ciov
erdalc ana Stockton where Wool was sold at last
year's trices, and the Wools were In general Â«ooJ
condition. In this marke the sales since election
do not union nt to very much, only occasional lots
selling . The outlook is that we will have a good
steady market at about last yeat's prices." â¢â ' .-â 'â ' -

COALâ Harrison's circular says: â  â â¢During the
week there have been 10 arrivals , from the Coast
collieries with 16.900 tons Coal, from Australia '1
arrivals with ' 6820 tons. All ' the wharf room is
taken up and all the coa: teams are busily engaged
taking delivery of I recent : nrrivals, and will be so
for several weeks to come. Fortunately the prin
cipal wholesale dealers r have the I necessary acces
sories for handling Coal expert It otherwise
ship's claims for demurrage would be occasionally
handed in. 1 Business this week in this line has
been very lively; both /or steam and tor domestic
use*, particularly toe Utter, a* the recent storms
have forced our housekeepers to Increase their
fuel consumption to warm their residences. Quota
tions remain about the same, except for steam
gr dcs, win. h show a better .feeling;: as the writer
has been predicting for two n ontbs past that the
prices then ruling would not be repeated for a
lons time to come and that value* 1 had assuredly
to advance,' which they will {continue to dolor
some time. - The quotations of 1896 ; for fuel will
no*, be duplicated. in 1897. - Swansea Anthracite
hat been marked up fully $1 Â¥ ton, and Austra
lian is moving up slowly. Cote has been advanced
$2 'fÂ» ion. although stocks on hand are ample tor
all immediate requ!r. men s: . holders will . force
consumers to subjiltute o. her fuel if they quote it
any higher. The present depression in outward
grain tret, bts will force Coal carriers to set-* more
profitable business elsewhere.' Wheat Is the'dic
ta'or' of the situation, but it is Imprudent some
times to assert Its power as at prenent; it may
make ,01111:1 v. rv scarce here In 1867." ' â Â

The Matter Will P.obab'.y Be Ttken

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
â¢ ' . 908 Broadway, Nov. 20. J
They were two young men, and they were
attending a church fair. One of them said to
% the other, with a mocking laugh on his lips:
'"'â¢Come, Jack, let's eat some peanuts for Jesus
Christ's sake." Some of the Christiana who
â¢heard them wore fearfully shocked, while
â¢ others laughed uneasily at the coarse and
'blasphemous witticism. Yet shocking as it
was the remark was exceedingly suggestive.
The church was selling peanuts for Jesus
Christ's sake. If not so, then why was the
house of prayer made a place of merchandise,
, ancL -v hy were the irreligious asked to come
tiijtiaey might help a good cause? Over that
â 'â¢ -tand was written in letters which all
m.-.t read who had understanding: "This
â¢ church stands for the gospel of Christ. The j
members of it are not willing to give enough
money to support it. We have bought peanuts
v at a low figure and expect to sell at a good
figure to people who care nothing about re
ligion, in order to get the money which we
.cauiioi. get after the apostolic way. Coma and
. help us out by patronizing our booths. Buy
' some peanuts for Jesus' sake." Some of the
. members didn't see the writing, but the young 1
men did and acted upon it. They simply
. translated into the language of the street
what- the members of the church expressed in
â¢ a m uch more polite and intentionally ambig
uous way. They repeated the catechism which
the, church taught them, only they put the
meaning of their teachers into words of their
own. . And the church Rot their nickels and
lost their respect. They paid liberally for
' their peanuts, but they threw in with the
" price their contempt and scorn for a religion
which needed that kind of support.
The above quotation from the last num
. ber of the Pacific Baptist has created gen
â¢ . eral excitement among those interested
in church affairs and it is not at all un
likely that it will be acted upon and made j
the subject of some resolutions at the next j
meeting of minister*.
. Rev. C. A. Wooddy of Portland is the
editor of the magazine and Rev. Robart
Whittaker of East Oakland is the associ- j
% ate editor, and these are the two gentle* 1
men who are jointly responsible for hav
in? stirred up much conflict of opinion !
a-rnong the leading members of the de
nomination. At present no one cares to
â¢ express a definite opinion prematurely,
but all agree that it looks as if the organ I
of the Baptist denomination intended, to
REV. G A. WOODDY, Editor of the Pacific Baptist, Who Has
b> ' Started a Crusade Against Church Fairs and Bazaars.
organize a crusade against church lairs
and lotteries.
. The editors proceed to say that they are
thoroughly persuaded that the churches
have loat a large Dart of their efficiency
byfawnJDS and catering toan unbelieving
world in order to pet money for the Lord.
A leading member of tÂ«ie First Baptist
'Church said to-day that a majority ol
ministers indorse the sentiments con
tained in the editorial which has caused
so much comment. "Not long ago," he
said, "Rev. Mr. Hobart said nearly the
same thing from the pulpit, while Rev.
Mr. Whittaker has consistently opposed
such affairs. The trouble is that, al
though the ministers as individuals are
opposed to raising money by such catch
penny schemes, they are in the power of
the churcb-members and cannot do as
they please. In no church in thin city
does the pastor control the social side of
it. That is taken out of his hands en
tirely, and any attempt on his part to in
terfere would soon be followsd by a
change of pastor. Unfortunately, we
haveÂ°had several instances of this within
the past few years, and there is one
church of the 'Baptist denomination to
day which would be split in two if it were
not for the forbearance shown by its
pastor. .
"â¢Under these circumstances the oflicial
denunciation of church fairs is lively to
cau6e some trouble and will certainly
bring out much opposition. It is not
pleasant to admit that we cannot sustain
our churches without resorting to such
worldly means, but a refusal to admit it
*oes not alter the facts. A few months
4*-o one o! our Baptist churches needed a
â f* carpet and a aeries of entertainments
ai\ socials and a system of begging were
practiced in order to adorn the sanctuary.
There is no doubt that the practice of giv
ing Jairs is derogatory to the dignity of
the church, but if they are to be discarded,
Jhe individual members must rnafie up
their minds to contribute directiy to its
support, instead of niching indirectly
from other people's pockets. Of course, I
don't naÂ«an that these remarks should apÂ»
ply solely to the Baptist organization or

to it any more than any other, but it is a
good thing that our organ has taken th â¢
matter in band.*'
GALLANTRY ON TOP,
How Pastor Ellin Nearly Spoiled
the Church Soloist's
Benefit.
OAKLAND. Cal., Nov. 20.â The gal
lantry of Prosecuting Attorney Melvin of
the Police Court tended in a large measure
to make Mrs. Eva Wren's concert to
night a success. When the clear tones of
Harry Melvin' s powerful bass voice were
heard in Centennial Church very few of
the audience were aware that a case
which came under Mr. Melvin's judicial
no.ice nearly caused his absonee.
A few months ago Mrs. Wren was en
paged to sing at the Centennial Church,
anil Rev. J. \V. Elis guaranteed the lady
her salary. As events pToved, he was not
able to fulfill his guaranty, and a short
time ago it was decided that Mrs. Wren
coul'l have the free use of the church and
tbe backing of its membership if she
would provide tbe talent to give a benefit
concert. Among those who cheerfully
consented to help was Harry Melvin.
Aftergivlng his consent Mr. Melvin learned
j that Rev. J. W. Ellis was concerned in \
I the affair and delicately declined to be in i
j any way identified with anything to j
: which the pastor was a party. , .>
Several months ago Rev. J. W. Ellis un- i
j dertook to espouse the cause of an old j
man arrested for felony. Young children
were involved in the case, and Mr. Melvin
prosecuted, with the vigor that he deemed
I the circumstance demanded. Rev. J. W.
Ellis sent some comrtrunications to the lo
cal papers, in which , he made some very
severe remarks regarding the case. Mr..
I Alelvin j did not deign to reply, but cvi- !
dently did not forget what he deemed the 1
. pastor's unwise and uncalled-for remarks.
When assured that to-night's concert
j was solely in the interest of Mrs. Wren
I Mr. Melvin decided to forego his personal
feeling for the pastor and to help Mrs.
Wren, which he did right well.

THE SA\ T FRAKCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21. 1896.
ATTACK MADE
ON BERKELEY
Professors Rise in Defense
of the University of
California.
Agricultural College Declared
Useless by Southern Cal
ifornia Press.
Professor Hilgard S*ys That the
Accusations Are a Lot of C: n
scienceless Falsehoods
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 20.â The pro- j
fessorsat the State University, especially
those in the agricultural department, are i
h.g .ly incensed at an editorial which ap
peared in a recent issue of the Los An- j
peles Herald, and which they say has put
the university in a false light before the
puolic.
The article referred to attempts to estab- j
lish the proposition that the university is
of no benefit to the people of Southern
California, and further that the depart
ment of agriculture in particular is a use- !
le*s institution and productive of harm ;
rather than good.
Professor E. W. Hilgard, bead of the
department of agriculture, says the arti- j
clc is meant to lash the whole university
over the back of the agricultural depart
ment.
'The whole thing," said he to-day, "is a
conscienceless misrepresentation from be
ginning to end. Falsehood after false
hood is printed in it."
The editorial which has caused all this
stir and which has urged the faculty to
rise in defense of the university is in part
as follows:
This university is now in competition with
all tbe institutions for higher learning in
Boutht.rn California. AH our institutions are
supported by private donations and by stu
dents' dues, wnlle the university receives the
public money and the pubic taxes from South
ern as well as from Northern California. The I
benefit to Southern California is little, if any, I
greater in the existence of the Berkeley and I
Ban Francisco colleges than in those of Yale,
Harvard, Cornell, Princeton or any other
American college or university. We might
gay, indeed, that Stanford, supported Irom do
nations, is of quite as much' service to the
community as the Berkeley University, sup
ported by taxes or Plate bonds. We say this
with the greyest respect for the university in
the north. What we call attention to is that
this costly institution is too far away to be in
any true sense a part of our Ufa in Southern
California. Soutuern California has colleges
and universities of its own. These should re
ceive the support of any public taxes in this
section for such purposes.
The next LeKislature will be asked to appro
prititc at least half a million for grand new
biiililinÃS at Berkeley, and to reappropriate I
$300,000 for the new Affiliated C 'leges at
Ban Francisco. This means, in k.:, nearly !
$1,000,000. Doubtless this will be merely a |
preliminary appropriation, to be followed by ]
others, to complete ana then to ciirry on the
proposed splendid bulldlnes and establish
ineut.
The question has been asked our farmers, j
viticulturlsts and forestry men what they
have gained from this distant northern uni
versity's Agricultural College annex. This
college is the only one bavin* direct dealings
with Southern California. The answers are
not in a single case favorable to the utility of j
the college. Kichard Gird snys that they ad
vised him that he could not grow sugar beets
at Chtno. Think of what would have resulted
in the lons to the community had Mr. Gird fol- j
lowed such advice.
E. C. Btchowslii of the great Sunny Slope
winery and estate says that the college intro
duced vines from iuiected districts in France,
and has th as caused the destruction of millions
of dollars of property in the raisin market and
wine-gitpe vineyards. These gentlemen in
Berkeley have quarrels from Santa BarDara to
San Diego and with men like Gird, Ellwood
Cooper, Bichowski, etc.
The agricultural college is apparently worse
thaii useless and does damage where it might
do good. It has our forestry interests in
charge, yet not a word on forest tiros has
escaped any of its officers. Their whole Inter
est seems to be centered in keeping our citi
zens in Southern California from any ad
vantage Id our forest station. In view of this
condition we would suggest that before our
legislative representatives from Southern
California consent to the large appropriation*
to be asked for in the interest oi Berkeley
they secure local control for our local Indus
trial scientific work.
In all probability we can obtain also our
share of the large Federal appropriation
which now goes to tne Berkeley College of
Agriculture. The iantastic agricultural col
lege, with its self-praise men, political lobby
ists, large salaries and one and a half gradu
ates, is a mountain in labor that brings forth
a mouse. Southern California should be freed
from this remote college control and mistakes
in our local industries. Whnl we want is a
local control in our scientific agricultural
work. This should be practical with local
men to whom farmers and fruit men can go
direct with their questions. Berkeley is too
far off to be usefmtous. Our farmers'insti
tutes, agricultural, chemistry, entomology,
and all our scientific work in agriculture,
Khou.d be done here, with a local headquarters
preferably in a central location, easy or access
to all of Southern California and easy equal y
for the scientific man to visit the point of in
terest; our soils, crop* and climate arc pe
culiar to this section, and our taxes should go
not too far up aud to hostile northern men,
but to our own scientists for our own work.
In reply Professor Hilgard says that he
wrote to the gentleman who wished to
plant beets, not to plant his beets in the
alkali lands of the creek.
Continuing Professor Hilgard said:
"About ten years ago we haa a quantity
of phylloxera on tbe grounds, which we
kept in order to test the habits of the in
ieet. During the entire lime the inÂ»ect
was on the experimental grounds we did
not ship a single cutting into the country.
"Furthermore, after we accepted the
Viticultural Coromisi-ion, we found phyl
loxera in the vineyard of the commission's
former chief executive."
May Chniige the V:im<\
T BERKELEY', Cal.. Nov. 20.â The ques
tion of changing the name of the post-
I office and railroad station from Lorin to
South Berkeley is being agitated. At the
iime of the establishm nt of the postofflce
the place was called Alcatraz, after its
i principal street.
The PostotÃce authorities selected the
name "Lorin," in order that the office
might not be confounded with the Alca
traz Island postoffice. Upon petition *-he
railroad company changed the name to
I Lorin.
Now a petition is to be put into circu-
l ation asking the postoinco authorities
I and the railroad people to auree to a
change in the name to South Berkeley.

Â» Deathblow to the Japanese
Beetle.
ALA M EDA. Cal., Nov. 20.â Professor
AlDert Koebele, under whose direction
the State Board of Horticulture four years
ago introduced the Verdalia cardinalis
and Rhizobius ventraiis into this State
and which have been such a godsend to
California, returned yesterday from Hono
lulu. He left bis home, 1226 Regent
street, last April, and has been on tbe
islands ever since. The Japanese beetle
bud been devastating the roses, pinks,
orange trees and grape vines when the
professor discovered that they worked
only nt night. He imported a colony oi
toads and bats which feed at night, and
thus slumped the bug almost out of ex
istence. Then he found beetles high up
in the mountains afflicted with a fungoid
disease, and "with this disease he innocu-
Jated others in the valleys, which is help
ing to rid the country of them.

George W. Jenlts of tbe bark Lydia, who
resides at 241b Webb aVenue. this city, re
turned to-day from a whalin? trip to Si
beria. He sailed from here March 11 and
was gone eight months and seven days.
The homeward journey was begun from
the Okhotsk Sea on October 13 and
was a very stormy one all the way.
"Siberia is the worst, bleakest and most
barren country in the world." said Mr.
Jenks to-day. "There is little or no veg
etation, while the mountains and ravines
are constantly covered with snow. It is
inhabited by a tribe who seem to wander
from place to place and who for a liv
ing depend upon hunting and fishing.
They are a fiithy set. If tbere is any
thing filthier than a pig it is a Siberian.
They seem covered with grease and dirt,
yet are the healthiest set of people I ever
saw."

EXTRAVAGANZA
BY STUDENTS
University of California
Boys Take to the
Stage.
They Will Appear in "In Ko
kopo" on Thanksgiving
Evening.
A Satirical Burlesque by Dj Witt H.
Gray on Woman's Rights and
Other Things.
As a fitting finale to the interuniversity
I conflict on Thanksgiving day the students
of the University of California have deter
mined to produce a burlesque extrava
ganza. Tbe show will be given at nigbt
in tbe Auditorium, on Eddy street, it is
confidently believed before a crowded
house. It will be the first attempt of the
Berkeley boys in this direction and conse
quently they are putting forth their best
efforts to make it a grand success.
The extravaganza is entitled "In
Kokopo" â a Durely fanciful name for a
mythical isle whither some maidens be
take themselves to be far away from man
and to run a government of their 6wn. It
is written by De Witt H. Gray, editor-in
chief of Josh, the interuniversity paper.
There are three alleged acts in the piece,
which will be presented by students in
the following cast:
Queen Yoyo, Joe Ros borough; Swatem,
Lord of the Slipper, Fletcher McNutt;
Cinchem. Lord oi the Cinch. Walter A. Starr;
Rabbs, Lord of the Leisure Hour, Dudley
Denne; Gyp, the court Jester, William Smith;
Uoie, secretary to the Queen, H. B. Quinan;
Leonora, daughter of the Queen, Henry Brir
ard; Gertrude, daughter of the Queen, Ned
Blake; Dix, daughter of tbe Queen, Ben Bake
well; Troubadour, Otto Wedemeyer; the
Legit, Sterling Carr; the castaway comedi
ans, Alexander Rosborough and George Kop
pitz. Choruses of suffragists, boarding-school
girls, football men, troubadours and come
dians.
The main idea in the burlesque is to
satirize women's rights. There is a Gov
ernment by women alone; also a plot.
Qneen Yoyo has Gathered about her all
tbe discontented female spirits she can
find and they all take themselves to the
island of Kokopo. By way of variety
three men are allowed to accompany the
Queen â Gyp, the court jester; Swatem, a
tramp, and Cinchem. While the Govern
ment is enjoying a girls' seminary state of
peace a ship loaded below the Plimsoll

WAS LOCKED OUT.
Young Men Republicans Do Same Old-
Time Politicsâ Pulcifer Was
Surprised.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 20.â There was
to have been an election of officers of the
Young Men's Republican League last
night, but there was not. There was,
however, * good debt of excitement before
| the adjournment.
The trouble arose over the fight for the
presidency. The candidates are J. "VV.
i Stetson and Harry Pulcifer, and each has
a large following, and each side is claim
ing that the otaer side is responsible for
last night's unpleasantness.
The meeting was duly called to order
when it was discovered that the hall was
racked with Pulclfer's friends. President
Phil Walsh was in the chair and an
nounced the object of the meeting. There
was general surprise at the personnel of
the attendants, and some of the amateur
political managers decided that something
must be done if Mr. Pu!cifer were not to
i have a walkover. His friends had locked
the door, it is said, with the intention of
keeping out Stetson's supporters.
Stetson's friends, however, were not to
be outdone, so they bunted up Constable
Cronin, who has the keys of Justice Clift's
courtroom, where the meeting was being
held. Cronin ot>ened the door and in
rushed the Stetson wing at the ratio of
about 16 to 1 compared to Mr. Pulcifer's
followers. This changed the entire aspect
of affairs, and strategy had again to be re
sorted to. But it was forthcoming.
Will D, Powers, secretory ol the league
and also a candidate for Councilman, is
an ardent supporter of Mr. Pulcifer, and
Mr. Stetson's friends say tbat Powers real
izes that in a fight for office he would lose

nothing by being backed by the president
of such an active body as the Young M/en's
Republican League.
Mr. Powers suddenly discovered that be
had made a grievous error. He arose and
informed the chairman that he bad not
fulfilled his duty in sending out the neces
sary notices to members, as required by
the constitution. President Walsh thought
that the point was a good one.
As an additional surprise, an enormous
attendance of members from WeÃt Oak
land nocked into the hall. Nobody knew
or would admit that they were aware of
the candidate whom they undoubtedly
came to support. It was un enigma, and
President Walsh was unable to solve it.
So, with his well-known legal acumen, be
quickly decided that a little continuance
for a week or so to enable the managers
to discover just how they stood would be
very advisable. In the face of Mr. Powers'
admission it would be clearly illegal to
proceed with the election, so Mr. Walsh
declared an adjournment till the first
Friday in next month.
The secret of the West Oatland con
tingent has not yet been solved, but it is
reported tbat tbe friends of Mr. Walsh,
who are anxious to see him continue in
his present position, planned a little coup.
They decided to take advantage of the
breach between the Stetson and Pulcifer
wines and to put in their man as a com
promise candidate, with some hope of suc
cess. Whether this is the programme or
not will be developed at the next meeting.
WANTED FOR BURGLARY.
The Monterey sheriff Claims HÂ»wley
for Crime Committed There.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 20.â William
Hawley, one of the two desperadoes ar
rested on the ferry-boat last week by Dep
uty Sheriff Kellner after they had once
escaped from him, was turned over to the
Sheriff of Monterey County to-day to be
taken there and held for a burglary com
mitted three months ago with an accom
plice, who pleaded guilty and was given
three years in San Quentin. The Monte
rey officer believes he has a strong case,
and that his man will get a heavier sen
tence than the otner.
The Sheriff says Hawley's true name is
Arthur Jack and that he is a half-brother
of James Carlin, alias Kelly, with whom
he was arrested at the mole. When the
cases came up in the Police Court to-day
their attorney made a lengthy argument
against the legality of the action of the
police department in turning one of the
men over to the Monterey authorities be
fore their cases were settled here, and
claimed he desired to call Hawley to
show that Carlin, alias Kelly, had*notbing
to do with stealing the coat. The cases
werd continued.

Mayor Davie has forwarded the following
reply :

following named gentlemen of the city of Oak

League Headquarters.
OAKLAND, Cal,, Nov. 20.â The Army
and Navy Republican League held a
largely attended meeting last evening and
decided by a big vote to retain their pres
ent headquarters for the winter so that any
of their 700 members might have a place
to meet together whenever they see fit.
This action was tasen against the report
of the camp council which desired to take
smaller quarters and several of them pre
sented their resignations, but they were
not accepted as the council had not ren
dered an accounting of the funds received
and disbursed during the recent campaign.
>Â»t k Candidate.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 20.â John A.
Britton, president of the Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company, has furnished
the following for publication:
Please announce that I am not a candidate
for the position of Mayor of this city. I am
not unmindful of the great honor that such a
position confers, nor ungrateful for the kind
intentions of my friends, but at this time can
not permit my name to be used. Yours very
truly, John A. Bkitton.
'â¢On Land or SeÂ»."
It is becoming so common to write
(with or without quotation marks) "tbe
light that never was on land or sea," that
it seems well to call attention to the fact.
One of the most recent examples of the
risky haphazard reference is in Professor
Paintsbury's "Nineteenth Century Litera
ture," page 81. Speaking of Byron, Mr.
SSaintsburv says: "The light is not that
which never was on land or sea; it is that
which is habitually just in front of the
stage." This formidable antithesis need
not, meanwhile, be discussed for the
theory it embodies, but it may be permis
sible to draw attention to the Wordsworth
reference.
Professor Saintsbury, it is true, does not
profess to quote, but the allusion no doubt
is to the great line in the "Elegiac
Stanzas Suggested by a Picture." "Land
or sea" sounds more open, buoyant and
free than "sea or land," but it labors
uuder the disadvantage of not being
what the poet wrote. This is tho quatrain
(it is the fourth in a poem o! fifteen such
stanzas):
Ah ! Then, if mine had oeen the Painter's hand,
To express what then T saw; and add the gleam,
The light that never was. on sea or land,
The conscr:it!on, and the Poet's dream.
The punctuation of the famous line
should be noted, as a factor in deepening
its significance. â Notes and Queries.

IROQUDIS BRAVES
WIELD TOMAHAWKS
They Fall on the Heads
of Certain Alleged
"Renegades."
About a Dozen Men Requested
to Resign From the
Organization.
Charges Made Against Isadora Jacobs
for Voting the McKinley
Ticket.
Bitter speeches and denunciations
disturbed the political powwow of the
Iroquois braves around their fire in
Pythian Castle last night.
Several members were virtually read
out of the Democratic party by the club
while assembled round that campfire
and condemned as traitors and renegades
because they did not vote for Bryan and
50-cent dollars. It was the most exciting
time ever witnessed in the history of the
club, so the members admit.
Hardly had the meeting been called to
order and the roll been called when Secre
tary D. J. Gordon read a resolution charg
ing Isadore Jacobs with voting for the Re
publican electors on. the 3d of November,
1896, and openly repudiating the Demo
cratic party on November 10. He moved
that an immediate hearing of the charges
be had.
The matter was referred to a committee
composed of Judge Lemon (chairman),
James J. Flynn, Max Popper, P. M. Wel
lin, Professor Simmons. The committee
will meet to hear charges next Tuesday
evening at Judge Lemon's office in the
Marye law buildiue.
There arose another brave, Raymond
Robins, and flung a keener tomahawE
than his predecessor. The way his verbal
weapon whistled through the" air caused
consternation unbounded among the
forces at which it was directed.
Robins' resolution stated that the Iro
quois Club was an organization engacecJ
in the dissemination of Democratic princi
ples and the welfare of the Democratic
party; that certain members of the club
Lad forfeited their right to membership
by openly or covertly opposing the Na
tional platform as adopted by the
last legally constituted convention of
the Democratic party held at Chicago on
the 9th and 10th of last July; and that
therefore they were "traitors and rene
gades" from the ranks of Democracy in
California, and if permitted to remain in
the club would degrade its name and en
danger the success of tbe party in the
future.
The resolution ended by calling for the
immediate withdrawal of these men from
membership and tbat the club unan
imously accept all their resignations as
tendered.
Hardly had Robins taken his seat when
Attorney George H. Francoeur popped
out of bis seat with tbe bold assertion
that he had voted for Palmer and Buck
ner and would resign if the club wished it.
Jeers, hoots and hisses followed.
The resolution was given to the proper
committee, namely: Max Popper (chair
man), James J. Flynn, E. P. E. Troy and
G. W. Cabaniss. They retired for con
sultation and shortly returned with a rec
ommendation tbat the resolution be
adopted, with a few insignificant correc
tions.
Attorney Charles Wesley Reed opened
the debate by declaring that he had voted
for Palmer and Buckner, and endeavoring
to justify himself in the eyes of his fellow
members for his action. Then came pan
demonium.
"The Chicago platform was not made
up of true Democratic principles," he
shouted, "and as a firm believer in tbe
principles of Thomas Jefferson 1 could not
support it."
"Didn't you say," yelled H. L. Bien
iield, "not over four weeks ago that,
though the principles of the plntform did
not meet your approbation, you would
support the ticket?' 1
"That's what!" 'You bet he did!"
These were the choice English expres
sions, intermixed with groan- that came
from tbe sympathetic assemblage.
'Order, gentlemen; order!'' bowled
Chairman Gildea, pounding the desk be
fore him witn his gavel till the large por
trait of Andrew Jackson on the wall trem
bled, and that of Thomas Jefferson, rest
ing on the piano, nearly tottered from its
position.
This scene was only a starter. They
followed one another in quick succession
for over an hour, Reed trying to explain
that under the technical wording of the
resolution he could not be asked to resign.
Max Fopper followed iv a terse speech
justiiyin.' the report ot the committee,
during which John A. Wall leaned back
in his chair and regained bis lost wind.
At the conclusion of Popper's speech the
question was put to a vote and the resolu
tion almost unanimously adopted.
The names of those who come under the
censure oi the lodge and are requested to
resign, as stated privately by Secretary
Gordon, are, as iar as is now known,
Charles Wesley Reed, John C. Heenan,
George H. Francceur, Isadore Jacobs,
William D. English, John P. Irish, Henry
E Highton.
After the meeting adjourned Sam
Bra nhart made a fierce verbal onslaught
on Reed for some of his utt ranees, that
seemed likely to end in a personal en
counter and ghost dance, but peaceable
braves took Sammy away â perhaps to bed.

JOE TERRY LIKES
MUDDY GOING NOW
But on October 26 It Was
Most Distasteful to
Him.
The Dafeats of Red Glenn and
Moylan Crippled the Talent
Badly.
Plunger Riley Granmn Started In
the Winter Season by Backing
Ricario a Loser.
The crowd of racegoers that found its
way over to Oakland track yesterday
found picking winners a most difficult
task. The track was a sea of greasy Dlack
mud, and reversals of form were not in
frequent. Three very warm choices were
plastered over with the slush, and alto
gether the talent found it hard work
balancing cash as they started to take the
car home.
About the most Juicy, splashing, in
vigorating reversal of mud form was tbat
shown by Joe Terry of the Barns &
Waterhouse string. On October 26, the
second day of the inaugural meet at Oak
land, starting a prohibitive 1 to 5 favorite,
Terry was beaten six lengths by both
Coda nnd Two Cheers in a mile dash run
in 1:48. On this occasion the track was
muddy, and as an excuse for his poor
showing it was said the horse did not like
the going. Yesterday, with the same
weight up, he started in the last event on
the card, over a mile and a furlong, and
was a 4 to 1 chance in the betting, Little
Cripple ruling a warm favorite. When
tbe field was dispatched Terry made all
the running, and in a mild sort of a drive
beat the favorite out in I:s9>Â£. Possibly
since his previous defeat the cuestnut has
cultivated a taste tor sloppy going.
Riley Grannan was on hand bright and
early, and after renewing old acquaint
ances in the ring proceeded to back Ri
cardo, one of the starters in the first race.
Ricardo was nearly left at the post, and
the younp Kentuckian wound up the day
by putting his checks down on Coda, who
finished De ond the money in the last race
run.
Ed Purser's Red Glenn was again made a
pronounced favorite for the first race of
the day, a seven-furlong run with a field of
ten starting. Seven to 10 was always ob
tainable aeainst the gelding, but the wise
money went on Excuse, who was played
down "from 10 to 7. The latter led all the
way, winning cleverly from the favorite,
who came from the rear and was beaten
out a neck. Seaside was a poor third.
Naglee Burkes filly Dura at first opened
favorite at 7 to 10 for the two-year-old
dash at five and a half furlong-, but re
ports of Alma's improved form sent that
filly to the post an "even-money chance,
while Dura receded to 2^ to 1. Emelia S
led to the stretch, where it then centered
down to a drive between Dura and Alma.
Although floundering badly in the muddy
Eoing, Jones goi the latter past the wire,
winner by a scant head in 1:11%.
Salvable, Ruinart and Rey del Tierra
were scratched out of the six and a half
furlong purse, leaving four very ordinary
two-year-olds to contest for the curse.
Tempestuous was a 1 to 3 favorite, and.
leading from the jump, beat Jay Wheeler
out with very little to spare. D. J. Tobin
made ud a dozen lengths in tbe run home,
and was downed but a head fur the place.
There were but three starters in the
seven-fiwione handicap, Moylan carrying
113, Sir Piay 110 up aud Grady in at 90
pounds. Moylan ruled favorite at 13 to
20, and, galloping away in front at the
start, looked an easy winner, but "dogged"
it badly the last sixteenth, and was beaten
out cleverly a length by Sir Play, which
horse was splendidly rated by Willie Mar
tin. Grady was beaten off. The winner
went to the post at odds of 3 to 2.
Notes.
The liberal scratching made the card de
void of all interest.
The Oakland course is many, many
degrees from bfing as good a winter track
as tbat at Ingleside.
"Stony" Clark, with a string of four
horses, and Tommy Gnflin with eight
good platers, arrived from Nashville
yesterday. Griffin took his hor?es to
Inpleside track, while Clark stopped over
at Oakland. In Griffin's lot is the good
mare, Addie Buchanan.
J. J. O'Neil. the prominent Western
bookmaker recently arrived, kept a close
watch on the ring prices yesterday.
Fred Cowan. Harry Harris and Roy
Carruthers, who got here Thursday even
ing with Grannan, did very little specu
lating.
On Wednesday Moylan, who won the
third race, a selling affair, was bid up

HIT WITH A BUNGSTARTER
John Kidney, One of Coxey's Lieuten
ants, Felled by His Sou
in-Liiw,
John Kidney, he of the Kearney riot
days and one of Coxey's lieutenants, was
stitched up about the head and face yes
terday at the Receiving Hospital. He
was also booked at the Central station on
one cbaree of common drunk and another
of threats against life. In the latter case
Fred Baaser, his son-in-law, who inflicted
the injuries upon Kidney, is the complain
ing witness.
Eleven months ago Baaser married Miss
Kidney, and with her has been running
a saloon on Army street and San Bruno
road. Between the two they made euough
money to keep themselves quite comforta
bly but for the fact that Kidney insisted
upon being a third sharer in the business
profits.
As Kidney has a natural antipathy for
work and an unnatural love for strong
drink he has made himself much disliked
not only at home, but throughout the an
tire Mission district.
About noontime yesterday he dropped
in with a friend of his same caliber upon
ais daughter and son-in-law. He was
well loaded witu whisky, and throwing a
dollar upon the counter he asked for a
drink.
Mrs. Baaser reproached her father for
having broken the total abstinence pledge
he took last weeic and refused him his re
quest.
"By all that is sacred," clamored the
irate man, "I'll have what I want in this
house if I have to pay for it.'
At this juncture Baaser stepped forward
and oidered his father-in-iaw out of the
place, saying he could not pet any more
liquor from him if he paid $100 for it.
This incensed Kidney to such an intent
that he drew a lone knife he had in his
coat pccKet and started to go behind the
bar declaring:
"I'll cut out your heart and lights,
you ."
Well, be quit threatening then, for Mr.
Baaser, disregarding paternal deference,
rose in his anger and smote Kidney over
the mouth with a handy bungstarter.
Kidney never was iair to look at, but he
is a sorrowful sight now.
Baaser was booked on â  charge of battery.
BETTER TIMES WITH COKE.
A Railroad to Utah Would Stimulate
California Manufacture.
Colonel Charles Watson of Kansas City
passed through San Francisco yesterday
on his way home from Los Angeles and
San Diego where he lately made a thor
ough study of the question of completing
the proposed railroad from Southwestern
Utah to Los Angeles.
"There is no question," he said, "that
the completion of the road would bring
Los Angeles within easy distance of
some of the largest known Western fields
of coking coal, and that is about all the
town needs to make it a heavy manufac
turing point. There are ereat fields of
suitable coal in Southwestern Utah, and
the shipment of this material in large
quantities can- be done at such a rate that
it can be used for manufacturing iron at
Los Angeles.
"Another big point about Los Angeles
is that the oil fuel is abundant, at a rate
that will bring pigiron down to even a
less sum than that prevailing in the East
ern centers like Chicago and Pittsburg. In
both these cities the manufacturers have
to send a long distance for iron ore as well
as coke.
"I find that there ate large quantities of
good iron ore down toward San Diego ana
at Los Angeles. Near San Diego there is a
mountain of iron. I saw samples thut
bore a very strong percentage, better than
much that is ranked with the best in the
East.
"I think you will see a marked boom in
manufacturing in California within a few
months after the railroad to the coke
fields is completed. It seems to me there
is nothing that can prevent it."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1806.
MALARIA RAGING
AT THE HOSPITAL
Doctor and a Nurse Fever-
Stricken by Noisome
Sewer Gases.
Overcome by Exhalations From
Broken Pipes and Bad
Plumbing.
Dr. Gallagher and Miss Hayden Very
111 and Dr. Hirschfelder Had
to Leave.
The reason why the city fathers and the
health authorities at last succeeded in de
ciding upon a comprehensive change in
the sanitary arrangements of the City and
County Hospital has just come to light.
It was almost a case of locking the stable
door after the steed was stolen, for serious
consequences followed the neglect of the
proper officials, several people connected
with the institution came dangerously
near the grave and, indeed, not a few are
still suffering from the effects of noisome
exhalations from sewers in and about the
old buildings.
For various reasons the sufferers re
mained silent. It has been said by people
in authority at the hospital that nobody
liked to make comments whicn might re
flect on the management, or upon those
members of the City government directly
responsible for the condition which has
caused so much sickness even among the
pbysicians.
The truth of the matter is malarial fever
has long been hanging like a cloud over
the City and County Hospital, sewers
were broken, or hopelessly stopped, and
the air reeked of poison and noxious odors.
Even disenfectants were of no avail to
neutralize the effects of such gases. In the
words ol an interne, "The walls are satu
rated with dangerous germs from tbe
decayed sewers, aim the alleged sanitary
arrangements are a menace to hoalth. 1 '
All this was made painfully apparent
*rhen young Dr. (jallagUer succumbed to
malarial fever, and a nurse, Miss Hayden,
was prostrated by the i-ame disease. Dr.
Hirscbfelder, who applied himselt assidu
ously to experiment* in the office or
laboratory of wards J and X, was caui^ht
by the noisome gases. All three had to
leave tbe City for a change ot air in con
junction with medical treatment. Others
have suffered in a less degree.
Dr. Gallagher appeared to be one of the
strongest young men among the internes.
He had a spiendid constitution, but re
maining too long near an unseen break in
a sewer, where duty called him, scattered
his strength, and he left tbe hospnal a
very sick man. He is now in the country,
eradually throwing off under the influence
of the pure atmosphere the malarial poison
in his blood.
Miss Hayden happened to be located in
another wing of the institution, where
the modern sanitation was not strictly in
accord with ideas on the subject as they
prevail in other Lospitais. The plumbing
and sewers worked t c wrong way, with
the result that nurses and internes have
had Headaches ior daily companions and
symptoms of fever were com ui on. Quinine
and other things in tiie drugstore have
been in great demand. Miss Hayden was
the first of the nurses to jrive up to the
disease, which came near ending her days.
The resident physician admitted that
they had been stricken with malarial fever.
"Even Dr. Hirschfelder, one of the visit
ing physicians," he said, "had to go to
Santa Cruz for a week to get rid of the
malaria. He says he got it from the con
dition of the sewerage system under the
office of J and X wards, where he had been
conducting experiments with tuberculosis
and doing a great deal of work with the
microscope.
"When the ground underneath was
opened they found the pipes broken.
These were of tbe old red terra-cotta kind,
very soft and of poor quality, and they had
entirely rotted away.'*
Dr. H. H. Hart of the Board of Health
said ttiat all needed changes would be
made in the sanitary appliances and gen
eral sewerage system of the City and
County Hospitai.
As a measure to provide for the safety
of physicians, nurses, etc., not to speak ol
the patients, it was absolutely necessary
tbat something be done.
"We got an appropriation from the
Board of Supervisors two weeks ago," he
said, "ana already the work of putting in
new sewers and plumbing has begun. In
a short time the conditions will be en
tirely changed."
The neighbors who live around the hos
pital, when informed of the sickness prev
alent within the institution from the vile
sewer system, have been greatly alarmed,
and many of them declare they will in
duce the improvement clubs to take up
the fight again for the removal of the hos
pital to another part oi San Francisco
j.hey believe tuat the best thing to be
done is to burn down the buildings and
erect a proper hospital elsewhere.
POST-NUPTIAL TEA.
Fashionablo Assemblage at the Recep
tion Given by Mm. Philip Alston
Williams.
One of the most elaborate teas of this
season was the one given by Mrs. Philip
Alston Williams yesterday afternoon,
between the hoars of 4 and 7, at her resi
dence, 2448 Union street.
Several hundred invitations were issued
for the affair and the pretty reception
rooms were crowded with fashionable and
handsomely gowned women, whose bril
liancy waa offset by an unnsnal number
for an afternoon teaâ of black coats. This
was the first opportunity the many friends
of Mrs. Williams (nee Tucker) had to con
gratulata her since her wedding last
spring.
Yellow chrysanthemums and graceful
ferns, grasses and palms were used with
ploasing effect in the decoration of the
artistic reception-room.
In the dining-hall pink roses and large
bunches of American beauty buds deco
rated the table, on which gleamed silver
ware and crystal. The corridor, with its
rich hangings of Oriental stuffs, needed
no floral adornment to enhance its artistic
appearance.
Assisting Mrs- Williams to receive her
friends were: Mrs. H. A. Williams, Mrs.
Duke Baiter, Miss Tucker, Miss Younger
Mrs. W. O. Wayman, Miss Grube, Misa
Isabel Hutchinson. Miss Mhoon, Miss
Prather, Miss McKee, Miss Davis, Miss
Mac Donald, Miss Goodall and Miss Ethel
Cohen.
There was music during the hours of
the reception and an elaborate 3ervice of
refreshments. Mrs. Wiliiams will receive
on Friday next from 4 to 7.
COUNCIL OF DELEGATES.
A New Body in Which the Representa
tives of All Public Organisa
tions Can Meet.
The conference of representatives from
the various public bodies of this City,
which was held at tbe room 3of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association
Thursday afternoon, promises to be one of
the most important ever held in this City
if the plans there outlined be carried out
as suggested.
The following is a list of the organiza
tions represented at the conference: State
Board of Horticulture, Merchants' Asso
ciation, Board of Education, Board of
Health, Bui.ders' Exchange, Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association.
After Junan Sonntag, president of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation, had called the meeting to order
James W. Kerr made an urgent appeal
for united action to remedy the evils from
which this City and State are suffering,
and for the purpose of effectually carrying
on the work suggested tbe formation of a
common council, to consist of one or more
delegates from each board of directors of
the various organizations. This common
council woula be called together at any
time by the request of any organization
represented in it. In support of his sug
gestion Mr. Kerr recited the airnculties
experienced in enlisting the interest and
support of kindred organizations in mat
ters of public concern, to that their united
force can be brought to bear successful^'.
By means of this council it waa shown a
representative could be had in every
board of directors who could be thor
oughly informed on any matter of com
mon interest.
This plan of securing united action was
well received, and President Sonntag was
requested to prepare a statement explana
tory of the purposes of the proposed com
mon council and forward the same to the
various clubs and associations.
The president was elected chairman of
the committee and C. L. Blethen tempo
rary secretary.
The meeting then adjourned to be held
on December 3, at 8 p. m., at the rooms of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation.

"JUDGE HUSTINGS THE NICEST
LOVER IN ALL THE WORLD"
Said to Have Been Tested in the Light of Millions
of Kisses Exchanged With His
Alleged Widow.
Sensational Developments in the
Contest Over the Jurist's
Property.
TALE OF THE CONTESTANT.
She Gives Details of an Unconventiona
Courtship and Two Marriage
Ceremonies.
Many of the most sensational elements
that characterized the celebrated Sharon
divorce case and have come to the surface
in tbe Fair estate litigation, as far as the
latter has progressed, promise to be devel
oped in the proceedings to be had before
Judge Coffey, commencing on Wednesday
next, in connection with the contest to
the will of the lateJud.e S. C. Hastings
filed by Mary Viola Hastings, better
known as Mary Keller, the alleged widow
of the deceased jurist.
In the deposition of Mary Viola, which
THE LATE JUDGE S, C HASTINGS.
was filed with Judge Coffey yesterday, a
very unconventional style of courtship is
described with minute detail and unction.
Strange marriage ceremonies aie told of
with the greatest complacency, while the
honeymoon that followed, according to
the fair contestant of 50, is as remote from
anything that would be attributed to the
founder of Hastings College of the Law as
can be conceived.
S. C. Hastings, formerly one of the Jus
tices of the Supreme Court of California,
died in 1893. It will be remembered that
some time previous he had made two
trust deeds to the great bulk of his
vast fortune, estimated in the millions,
giving his property to his children, who
at that time consisted of R. P. Has;ings,
prominent in politics, since deceased;
Dio Hastings, now of Sola no County; Mrs.
Major Darling; Mrs. Flora Keyes, now
dead, who married a son of General
Keye?, and who left a little daughter, and
Hiss Ella Hastings, now living with Mrs.
Darling. William Giselman, for many
y ears tne confidential agent of the dead
jurist,j urist, was named as trustee.
He alto .made a will leaving the re
mainder of his property â about $150,000,
exclusive of some minor legacies â to his
six grandchildren, three the children of
Mrs. major Darling, as 'lollnws: Mrs.
Louise La Montague of New Y<<rk, Mrs.
Jennie Grinneil, who was recently wedded
to Dr. Grinneil of the Presidio, and Dr.
Clinton C. H. Catherwood, now in New
York; and three the children oi Dio
Hastings, as follows: S. C. Hastings,
Hoyt Hastings and Ethel Hastings. Wil
liam Giselman and R. B. Wallace are
named as executors.
In 1885 the Judge had married a second
time, taking to wife Miss Knuts, who sur
vives him.
In the present contest, which waÂ« insti
tuted shortly after the filing of the will of
the deceased disposing of the $150,000. the
children of Mrs. Darlinc are represented
by Samuel M. Shortridee; those of Dio
Hastings by George A. Larnont of Solano;
Mary Viola Hastings, so called, by Sulli
van & Sullivan, and Mrs. Lillian Hastings
by Knigh & Heggerty.
The contestant, as the basis for her
claim to a share in tbe Hastings estate,
sets iorth that tbe deceased jurist at the
time of making his last will and testa
ment was insane, and that she is his
widow.
As a preliminary step in the contest
the deposition of the alleged widow was

N" " How to Produce Luxuriant Hur," mailed tree.
taken last year, the examination having
been conducted by S. M. Shortridge.
Matters went along swimmingly and in a
most interesting manner until Mr. Short
ridge requested the production of certain
letters claimed to be possessed by the de
ponent, which she said bad been written
to her by Judge Hastings, and which she
declared would prove her to be his widow.
Acting under the advice of her attor
neys she declined to submit these letters.
In* view of this turn of affairs Mr. Short
ridge returned the deposition, as far as it
had been taken, to Judge Coffey, and yes
terday served notice upon the contestant
that upon next Wednesday, November 25,
they would ask Judge Coffey to order her
to produce those letters, so that pro
ponents might inspect them and use them
as evidence in the matter at issue.
Tbe purpose of taking the deposition
was to ascertain on what grounds the
claims of the contestant were based, and
to enable the proponents of the will to
trace the life and career of tbe alleged
widow, who is charged by the executors
and legatees with being an adventuress.
Mary Viola Hastings is the name
claimed by the deponent. Viola, sbb de
clared, was the Catholic Daptismal name
given her by Father iJurchajrd without her
knowledge after her alleged marriage to
Judge Hastings. Her maiden name was
Mary Lake and she was born in Pennsyl
vania.
One of her peculiarities was shown in
her reply to the question of Mr. Short
ridge as to her age.
"You would not spoil a young widow's
prospecte?" she pleaded. "I attained my
majority before I came to California. I
am 49 years old."
The first twenty years after she was in
vented she pa-sed mostly in Pennsylvania,
and took occasion to inform her questioner
that she was a country eirl. She also dur
ing this period visited relatives in Ten
nessee, Kentucky, New York, Connecticut
and other places, and tnus probably ac
quired the nomadic habit to which she
later confessed she was addicted. She sel
i dom remained more than a month or two
j with any one of her relatives. She went
! to Memphis, Term., about the beginning
i of the war to live with a sister, and re
i mained there, in her own words, "until
the cruel war was over." While there she
married Berthoid Marscnner, a captain in
ian Illinois cavalry regiment. She graphi
cally described how she "stood the chances
of bullets" with her husband when she ac
companied him to Vicksburg. On their
journey she told how the pilot-bouse was
shot to splinters. Later she went to Chi
cago, where her husband dieu at the close
of the war.
In 1868 she came to California for her
I health, after having been bequeathed
i $75,000 by her uncle. William Keller, from
I the income uf which she lived.
j On arriving in this City abe went to the
â  Cosmopolitan Hotel, where, she says, she
I obtained a year's accommodation in ci
i change for a landscape painted by herself.
| This work of art, she mournfully informed
i her questioner, was lost to the world in
I the fire which destroyed the Tubbs Hotel
in Oakland.
Having exhausted tbe board and lodging
vaiue of her painting, she took up her
residence "at a place opposite the Baldwin
Hotel," where, for company's sake and
not for the incident rev nue, she had a
family live with her. "I took them," she
said, "because I thought I was too yonng
to live alone. I was a young widow in
those days and was besieged with beaua."
| After this she recorded a change of resi
dence every few months. Continuing her
life story, sbe said:
"I lived at 503 Mason street at the time
of my marriage to Jud c Hastings in 1877.
Up to 1883 I never lived more tnan two or
three months at any one place. I moved
every few weeks because a son of Judge
Hastings harassed me.
"After my marriage to the J udee I went
into the real estate and insurance business
as an agent and solicitor. I sometimes
made sales of real estate, end wanted to
insure the old man, but Mr. Giselman
would not let me do it.
"I was married to the Judge the first
time in 1877. I do not remember the
month. It was early in tbe spring. lean
recoliect the second marriage more defi
nitely. The first was a Quaker marriage.
It was a consent marriage. I was a Quaker
when 1 waÂ« young. They say the cere
mony tbembeives. They don't have
preachers to marry them."
"How long had the Judge known you?"
â¢he was asked by Mr. Shortridge.
"I had known him by sight from the
time I came to California. II a first wife
died in 1876, and she was not dead lone
before he was making love to me. He
said if I would marry him he would settle
$2,000,000 on me. I was very much ad
mired at that time and bad plenty of offers
of marriage.
"The marriace was as follows, Quaker
style. He Â«aid: 'I suppose I must take
thee, Mary, to be my lawful wife,' and I
said, 'I take tbee, Clinton, to be my lawful
husband.' and we joined hands before
witnesses. One of tbÂ«Â» witnesse* present
was Huen Clayton, a Quaker. He is now
dead. He was my caterer at that time,
and he was a high-toned caterer, too. An
otner witness was Mrs. Mary Kingman. I
do not know wnere she lives now. They
move so much in California I can't chase
them. Sbe was staying there in the bouse
as a friend of mine, but not paying. I
kept her as a companion.
"After the marriage he said he desired
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21. 1896.
me to become a Catholic, and that then
we would have another marriage.
"We went to the Caff House tbe night
nf our marriage and ne got beastly drunk.
I sobered him up and he got drunk a^ain,
and we bad a big time. I got him sobered
again, but he got two or three more gal
lons of liquor and again got drunk. I
lived from that time as bis wife.
"I was married tbe second time to the
Judge by the Rev. Mr. Steaoman. My
principal adviser was Charles Heggertv,
who was a boy at that time, but he knew
more about law than all these old lawyers,
and I followed his advice. He said no
license was required. After the second
marriage I lived at Mason street, where
the Judge resided, except when he was
out of town.
"The Judge went to Fourth and Berry
streets when he wanted to get drunK. He
usually wanted to get drunK once in three
month*."
She then described in detail their court
ship. "He was not drunk at the second
ceremony unless you call being in love
drunk. I loved him and beloved me, and
I think both of us were drunk with love.
"Love is a drunk, I think. He wai
crazy on love and so was I." Deponent
explained that she acquired the name of
Keller because when i>er uncle left her
$75,000 one of tbe conditions was that she
should take his name.
bbe added that she kept the . name
Mary because her first husband was a
count and she wished to retain the title of
countess. Continuing, she said:
"We did not want the children to find
out about the marriage. We were going
to have a swell marriage by and by, when
the children were to be informed of the
marriage.
"After the first ceremony we took a
drive in the Judge's carriage alone Van
Ness avenue and inspected some of his
property.
"I had the second marriage performed
because of the wishes of the church peo
ple. They did not know anything about
it, but I thought I would become a mem
ber and wanted this all right.
"I wanted a Protestant marriage, because
my people would disown and disinherit
me otherwise.
"I never told any of the children of the
marriage. I never claimed to be the wife
of Judce Hastings. We agreed not to
make it known until we had the Catholic
marriage performed. That was tbe stipu
lation between us In order not to deprive
him of Christian burial. I never ad
dressed him as my ..usband in the pres
ence of any persons. I only called him
â¢my darling,' 'my dearie,' but addressed
him as Judge in the presence of others."
"Have you the marriage document with
you?" asked Mr. Shortridge.
"Yes, sir," replied the lady.
"Kindiy produce it."
"Yes, sir."
"How does it not appear C. S. Hastings
instead of 8. C. ?"
"They reversed the name. The Judge
stated he did not like tbe name of 'Be
ranus.' He said it was only tit for a red
bull. That was the reason he did not call
himself Seranus. He said he never named
anything but his red bull after thatâ the
Durham. That is why it was reversed."
"The marriage certificate was written
two or three days after the ceremony by
the Rev. Mr. Steadman. Judge Hastings
never saw it. I showed it to 'Dio' and
'Robert,' two of the sons, because 1 liked
the boys and I wanted them to know I
was their new mother. When the Judge
was tipsy he always went by the name of
Mr. Haggin."
"How did it happen that Steadman
prepared a certificate?" she was asked.
"i thought it would be well to have it to
prove the marriage. In the East all that
is necessary is to jump over tbe broom
stick to get married. Two months after
Rev. Mr. Steadman married us ho went to
San Jose. I never heard of Mr. Steadman
again. Mr. Giselman waned to see my
marriage certificate many a time, but'my
lawyer said he was going to keep his
pow'ierdry and would not let him see it.
"The Judge could not bear to be out of
my sight. He was with me every moment
he could spare from his business."
In describing ber correspondence with
the Judge she said :
"I never in any letters called him hus
band or si Tied as his wife. I always
called him 'Darling Judge.' He addre-sed
me as 'lovey,' 'petty' and 'dearie.' He
never addressed me as 'Dear wife,' as we
expected Bob to open our letters. At one
time he stole a hundred of them. I like
better to be called 'lovey' and 'petty' than
'my dear wife.'
"I think 1 have 10,000 love letters put
away, from high dignitaries, men even
higher than Judge Hastings I was a
belle when I was young. I was not a belle
of 'Fetaluma,' but I was a belle every
where I went. I have 362 letters from
j Henry Shaw of St. Louie, a man worth
$50,000,000."
"I gave up all these nice American
I gentlemen to become the wife of a Count
and be a Countess. I wanted a handsome
now man for a husband."
"Have you any love letters from Judge
Hastings?" asked her questioner.
"I have several of them. He was not a
very fine scribe. You would think he had
dipped a fly in the ink and chased it all
over the paper."
"Did he evertalk of love?"
"He was the nicest lover in the world."
"How do you know that?"
"Because he could kiss sweeter than
anybody in the world."
"How do you know that?"
"By millions of kisses."
"From your experience of that love you
think he surpassed- ail other men?"
"My former husband would kiss my
hand. I don't like that style. He would
get down on his knees and kiss my hand.
I want a man with more dignity."
"What was the peculiarity of his
kisses?"
"He had the good sense to wash out his
mouth and wash all the tobacco taste out."
"Did you know of the marriage of Judge
Hastings to Miss Knuts? "
"When I heard of the marriage I fell in
a fit, and they lifted me up by the neck
and severed the vertebra almost, and that
is why I am having these fainting spells.
"Tbe Judge told me once that Mrs.
j Newlands' chambermaid chased him down
here while be was drunk, and he was wor
ried to death about it for fear I would
hear of it and that it would break my poor
heart.
"After his marriage to this woman he
never stayed in San Francisco over night
for foar 1 would have him arrested for big
amy. I told him I would. He told me
that Robert made him marry her."
Referring to tbe manner in which the
dead jurist disposed of his fortnne she
said :
"I heard of all this foolishnessâ that he
had put all his property out of his hands
to keep it away from both of us. I did
nor care what he did as long as he was not
divorced from me. I never in any open
or legal w*y asserted my rights.
"The last time I met him he said, 'I
was crazy or I would not have treated
yon so. Mary. Can't you forgive me?' "
it was at this juncture that the witness
admitted having letters which would
prove her to be the widow of Judge Has
tiners. Upon being requested to produce
them, however, she declined to do so,
hence the action of Mr. Shortridge, which
will bring the matter up for hearing be
fore Judge Coffey on Wednesday next,
when most interesting further develop
ments are expected.

TWO SCHOOLS
WILL BE CLOSED
Diphtheria Creates Alarm
in the Board of
Health.
Eight New Cases Have Been
Reported Within the Past
Three Days.
Institutions of Learning That Will
Be Visited and Subjected to Close
Scrutiny To-Day.
The Board of Health has decided that in
order to check the spread of diphtheria,
which threatens to become epidemic in
this City, it will be necessary to close two
and perhaps three of the schools from
which many of the recent cases have
emanated.
The board was at first inclined to make
light of the danger, but the reporting of
eight new cases within the past three days
has created much alarm and extreme
measures will be resorted to.
The schools that have been decided on
for closing are the Everett and Hawthorne
public schools and perhaps the Notre
Dame parochial school.
It was decided at the special meeting of
Wednesday last that the board should visit
tbe Hawthorne, Everett and Notre Dame
schools, from which a large number of
cases have been traced, and ascertain if
possible why such a state of affairs should
exist.
No particular date was assigned for the
inspection, but the alarming number of
tbe recent cases has hurried the board and
the visit will be made to-day.
The Health Officer, tbe inspector of the
district iv which the schools are located
and a plumbing inspector will. accompany
the board, and tbe sanitary arrangements
of both schools will be subjected to the
closest scrutiny.
It has been reported to tbe Board of
Health that the closets at tbe Notre Dame
School are built with open vaults, and
that these are responsible in a great
measure for the number of cases that have
been traced to this institution. Should
this prove to be correct tbe Board of
Health will order new sanitary appli
ances put in at once and the school closed
in the meantime.
There is serious talk among the mem
bers of the board of declaring the disease
epidemic, in addition to closing the two
schools mentioned, should any consider
able number of cases among the pupils be
reported during the n xt few days.
"Of course, this would be an extreme
measure," said a member of tbe board
yesterday, "but if diphtheria continues
to spread and appears to pain ground it wiil
he necessary to do so to prevent contagion.
When it once gets a firm footing diph
theria is a very hard disease to eradicate,
ard if the situation becomes really dan
gerous nothing can be gained by delay.
In several Eastern cities tbe health
authorities are now battling with epi
demics of diphtheria, and while we do
not fear that the disease will get the up
per hand we shall close the schools as a
matter of precaution."
The Health Officer stated yesterday that
he had io doubt that the disease would
be stamped out in short order, but ttiat
the closing of the schools was absolutely
necessary to effect th- eradication.
MAY TAX THE BONDS.
The City and County Attorney Renders
an Opinion In Reference to south'*
crn Pacific Indebtedness.
City and County Attorney Creswell ren
dered an opinion yesterday at the request
of the Board of Supervisors which sets at
rest the vexed question as to whether the
City has a riebt to assess the bonds of the
Southern Pacific Company owned by resi
dents of San Francisco. The opinion is
as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Supervitort of the
City and County of San Franci-co â Gentlemen:
1 am in receipt of your communication re
questing my opinion in regard to the petition
of John \V. Mackay and R. V. Dey, petitioning
your honorable board to order paid to them as
trustees of the estate of Mrs. Theiesa Fair, de
ceased, tbe sum of $2342 70 in satisfaction of
a judgment affirmed by the Supreme Court of
this State in tbe case of Mackay et al. vs. the
City and County of San Francisco.
In reply I will state that the judgment has
now become final, and should be paid.
While tne judgment in the above entitled
case was nominally against the City, the re
sult of the litigation was in reality a victory
for the City, for by v was determined that the
City had the right to tax nearly $2,000,000 of
bond= of the southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany of Arizona, which were owned by Mrs.
Theresa Fair at the time of her death, and
which her executors strenuously urged were
not taxable in this Sate. The tax on the bonds
amounted to $31,687 90, and was paid to the
City by the executors- of Mrs. Fair under pro
test. r
The judgment for $2342 70 above men
tioned represents the tax paid by the execu
tors on the 20 per cent raise of the bonds
aoove their face value made for purposes of
State taxation; and tne raise being in contra
vention of the constitution the tax thereon
was illegally collected and should be returned
to the executors of ttie estate.
The raise of 20 per cent above face va:ue was
made solely for the purposes of State taxation,
and the entire tax collected on the raise was
paid over to the Stale; therefore this entire
judgment against the City should be deducted
by tne Treasurer of the City and County of
San Francisco in iiis next settlement with the
State Controller, e s provided by the statute 01
February 27, 1893 fStat. 1893. p. 32).

was found that the contractor who took the
job of removing tbe debris of the old building
had neglected to tear down a party wall,
which Is said to support the walls of the build

of the work, it was not clear how he

ALL SEEKING ESCAPE.
Unusual Number of Convicted Criminals
Asking for New Trials From the
Supreme Court.
From all parts of the State appeals from
convicted criminals for retrial are pour
ine into the Supieme Court. One and all
of these appeals are based on technical
ities. In the past two months twenty-one
convicted criminals have asked the Su
preme Court lo give them another chance,
which is at the rate of about one every
three days. In every case the attorneys
have set up that tbe trials which Lave re
sulted disastrously for their clients were
not fair in some respect.
Such a general arraignment of Califor
nia Judges and jurors is something unpre
cedented. The financial stringency does not
interfere with raising sufficient money by
convicted criminals to pay for the print
ing of briefs and the employment of at
torneys in the least. Since the middle of
September tlie following persons have
asked the Supreme Court fora rehearing:
Henry Church, San Francisco, robbery.
John Maxwe'l, Napa County, perjury.
Benjamin L. Hill. Alameda County, murder.
James Cregan and Charles Becker, ban Fran-
Cisco, forgery.
Frame Wilson, San Diego County, assault
with intent to mnrder.
Frank L"wis, Shasta County, murder.
Jose Ylario. San Diego County, murder.
Edward Wickham, Alameda County, embez
zlement.
Manuel Gomez, San Francisco, rape.
James Holmes and seven others, San Fran-
Cisco, murdf r.
Clifton E. Wayne, Los Angeles County, rape.
William White, San Fraucisco. burglary.
Thomas Griffin, Coatra Costa County," rape.
The Durrant case will undoubtedly be
reopened to permit tbe introduction of
briefs. The day for the hearing of the
motion has been filed, being December 2.
This is the moat important case in some
re-pects liable to be considered in the im
mediate future. It will be recollected that
Paulsell, convicted ofirobbery, has, within
the past few days, been granted a new trial.
Why the convicted criminals have begun
to seek new trials in such number at this
particular time is something of a mystery.
The transcripts on appeal in criminal
cases fiied in the earlier part of the year
were quite numerous. In fact, there were
fifty-seven up to and including September
14, which makes a total of seventy-eight
convicted criminals who have sought a
new trial during this year. The rate prior
to September 14 was six a month. Since
then business of this sort has been livelier.
The present phenomenon is causing con
siderable comment among attorneys who
have criminal practice.
Queen Victoria has in her possession
three sea pictures executed by M. G.
Ricard Cordmgley, a young French
painter, who spent a lone time on board
one of tbe smacks in the Norm Sea mak
ing sketches of the men ac their arduous
work.
