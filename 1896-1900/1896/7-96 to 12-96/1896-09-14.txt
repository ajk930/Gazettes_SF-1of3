Details the accident are difficult to ob
tain, there being no telegraphic communi
cation with the scene nearer than Eureka.
As far as known the accident was caused
by the collapse of a bridge spanning Mad
River, about five miles irom Eureka. The
accommodation train which leaves Arcata
at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon consisted of
two coaches, one boxcar and engine, and
carried about twenty passengers. Shortly
after 5 o'clock a telephone message was
received stating that the train had been
derailed at Mad River bridge and was a
total wreck on the river bed. A relief
train with doctors, nurses and medical
supplies was immediately dispatched from
Arcata to the scene.
The three cars and engine were found
lying beneath the bridge, a mass of splin
ters. The injured had managed to drag
themselves from the debris ana were nurs
ing their cuts by the water side.
Buried beneath the wreckage were found
the bodies of Miss Holland, Miss Kirk
ham and Mr. Cameron. The unknown
child was alive when found, but died a
few minutes later.
The injured were carried up a steep
bank with great difficulty, and it was
nearly 10 o'clock when the relief train
started on the return trip to Arcata, bear
ing the dead and wounded.
The train was met at Arcata by the en
tire population of the torn, and the scene
was pitiful when the dead and injured
were claimed by friends and relatives.
The bridge that collapsed was several
hundred feet in length and had hitherto
been considered safe. It contained one
pier, about midway, and the approaches
were high above the gravel bed of the
stream. The train had slowed down to
about five miles an hour, as is customary,
and was moving at this speed when the
crash came. Had not the rules in regard
to speed been strictly observed every one
on board must surely have perished, as
an additional twenty feet would have
landed the entire train in the waters of
the river.
Mr. Louis Everdingof the Riverside Mill
Company, one of the passengers on the
wrecked train, said in an interview to- j
night:
"There were about twenty-five passen
gers on board and of this number only
three escaped uninjured. I was seated in
the smoking-car chatting with a number
of gentlemen when the crash came. None
of us bad the remotest idea of what had
occurred. We felt the car sink beneath
us, and after a downward plunge, such as
a person experiences on a rapidly falling
elevator, I felt a sharp jar and an instant
later I found myself crawling out through
the side door of the car. The train had
dropped a distance o.' fully forty feet to the
hard gravel bottom of the river.
"All the cars were smashed to splinters.
and no difficulty was experienced by the ,
The San Francisco Call
rescue party from Vance's Mill in remov
ing the dead and injured from the wreck
age.
"Alexander Cameron, tbe brakeman,
was riding on the front of the box car and
his body was crushed to a pulp. Miss
Annie Holland was struck on the head
and must have died instantly. Miss Kirk
ham was smothered and crushed to death.
"A sad case is that of the family of
David Wood. Mr. Wood is seriously in
jure 1 about the head, his wife has a
broken arm and leg and will probably die
and his two little children, a boy and
girl, cannot recover.
"As to the cause of the accident I know
nothing. We were moving at a slow
speed as we approached the bridge.
Wnen the eneine reached the first span of
the structure about 100 feet of the bridge
collapsed and down we went."
The iniured are receiving the best pos
sible attention, and nothing has been left
undone to provide for tneir comfort.
The cause of the accident remains a
mystery. The Ma'l River bridge has al
ways been reearded as pertectly safe. The
timbers have been renewed several times
and the structure daily sustains the weight
of freight trains treble that of the light
passenger train which met the mishap
to-day.
The Arcata and Mad River Railroad ex
tends from Arcata to Korbei, a distance of
twelve miles, connecting Eureka with
Arcata by trestle and ferryboat. The road
bed is well constructed, and there was
nothing flimsy about the Mad River
' bridge. The road handles the product of
rive lumber mill?, and is the best paying
railway in the world in proportion to the
capital invested.

The Prisoner Concerned in the
PhcÃnix Park Tragedy of Four
teen Years Ago.
LONDON, Enq., Sept. 13.â P. J. Tynan,
the notorious "No. 1" of the Irish Invin
cibles, who was so frequently mentioned
during the trial of the persons charged
with the murder of Lord Frederick Cav
endish, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and
T. H. Burke, Parliamentary Under Secre
tary, In Phcenix Park on May 6, 1882, was
arrested at Boulogne, France, at 4 o'clock
this morning on a warrant issued in 1882.
Tynan is also charged with being con
cerned in the manufacture of dynamite
bombs for use in England. It has been
learned tbat he arrived in Europe in Au
gust, when he debarked at Genoa. He
proceeded thence to Paris, where, it is al
leged, he consorted with the Irish dyna
mite faction. On Friday he arrived at
Boulogne and expounded Fenian views at
a hotel bar. He had been watched since
he arrived in France by an English detec
tive, who this morning placed him nnder
arrest. The officer poinied a revolver at
his head and threatened to shoot him if
he made the slightest resistance.
Tynan was speedily secured. He subse
quently admitted bis identity. In his
possession were found a considerable sum
of money and a number of incriminating

papers. He will be arraigned before a 1
judge in Boulogne to-morrow with a view j
to securing his extradition. It is stated '
that his arrest is connected with the ar
rests of Bell and Wallace, the former hav
ing been captured in Glasgow and the lat
! ter in Rotterdam.
Lord Frederick Cavendish arrived in
Dublin on May 6, 1882, to be present at the
formal entry of the new Viceroy of Ire
land, Lord Spencer. During the day he
was engaged in official business at the
Castle, and later he left the Castle on foot
to walk in Phoenix Park, where he met
Mr. Burke. It was a bright summer
bvening, between 7 and 8 o'clock, scarcely
less light than at noonday, and there were
many peoplf in the park. The two men
walked along the principal road until
they were within a few yards of the
Phoenix monument.
Some boys passed them and went around
the monument and when they returned
found the Chief Secretary and Mr. Burke
lying on the ground dead and covered
with wounds. On examination it was
found that Mr. Burke had received several
ptabs near the region of tbe heart and that
his throat had been cut His clothing was
much torn and his hands bore marks of a
fierce and protracted encounter. Lord
Frederick Cavendish had been stabbed in
several places about the chest.
The crime was witnessed by several per
sons, who thought the participants were
roughs wrestling. Four men, who were
seen driving in a car toward the monu
ment, were known to be tne murderers,
but for some time their identity could not
be established. The news of the assassina
tion caused intense indignation and sor
row. A reward of $50,000 was offered to
any one who should Â«ive information that
would lead to the conviction of the mur
derers, and a further reward of $5000 for
such other private information as should
lead to the same results, with a free pardon
to any person not tbe actual perpetrator
of the murders and full protection in any
part of her Majesty's dominions.
Many arrests were made, but the brief
est examination convinced tbe authorities
that tne police were not even on the track
of the murderers. At last clews were ob
tained and closely followed, and a large
number of further arrests made. Among
the prisoners was James Carey, a town
councilor, who later turned informer. He
had lured other men to join the Invinci
bles, which was an inner circle of the
Fenian organization, the object of which
was to murder Government officials.
Carey bad arranged the Phoenix Park as
sassinations, anu bad given the signal
when the deed was to be done.
Tynan, the man arrested to-day, was one
of those appointed to organize a society in
Dublin. The trial of the accused men re
sulted in a conviction ot Joseph Brady,
Daniel Curley, Michael Fagtn, Thomas
Caffery and Timothy Kelly, all of whom
were executed. Carey was released, and
started on a voyage uuder an assumed
name for South Airiua on tbe steamer
Melrose Castle. He was followed by au
Irish avenger, who shot and killed him at
Port Elizabeth.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 13.â Li Hung
Chang arrived in Vancouver by special
train and in bis private car, the Chetoo,
at 11 o'clock this morning. Tbe whole
city was on the gui vive to do him honor,
and long before tbe hour set for his arrival
crowds lined the approaches to the depot
and wharf, and masses of people crowded
all the eminences around the harbor. The
Chinese residents had erected a handsome
and artistic arch on the bridee leaain? to
the wharf, and a long line of Chinamen,
is rich robes of blue, green, plum-color,
olive and orange, stood in line before the
arch, waitine to kowtow to the great
Viceroy. The bridge was carpeted for
some yards on either side of the arch, and
on this carpet stood a carved ebony table,
on which an incense of sandalwood was
kept constantly burning in a richly carved
bronze burner.
The Chinese band played Chinese music
tbat sounded like that of bagpipes as Earl
Li alighted from the train. A carriage,
drawn by four white horses and draped
with Union jacks, waited to convey him
over the short distance from the train to
the steamer.
When the procession started the coach
was preceded by his celebrated scarlet
chair, carried by four men. Several bands
and a division of marines from the warship
in the harbor fell into line behind the
Viceroy, followed by a long deputation of
Chinamen in their picturesque robes.
Altogether it was a procession of such Ori
ental picturesqueness as the primeval
mountains never before looked down
upon â a procession in which Occident and
Orient came together, curiously com
mingled.
The ereat Viceroy seemed delighted with
the demonstration in his honor, and es
pecially with the homage of his country
men, who fell on one knee and raised
clasped hands to him as he' passed
smilingly by. His shrewd, kindly face
beamed, his yellow jacket made the
brightest spot in the sunless day and bis
cherished peacock feaber was displayed
falling from the back of his cap.
The gangplank of the Empress of China
was carpeted as for royalty with scarlet;
the ropes were wound with yellow and
draped with flags. As he was carried up
the plans in bis scarlet chair the Chinese
dragon flag was run to the mainmast and
a salute of nine guns was fired from H. M.
S. Comus.
The absence of cheering was noticeable,
and gave an Oriental solemnity to the pro
ceedings. All the ships in the harbor were
gayly decorated with rainbows of bunting,
and many of the roofs around displayed
kodak fiends blackly outlined with their
instruments against the pallid sky. Many
prominent ciizens had cards of admission
to tbe Empress, and crowded her decks to
catch a glimpse of the Earl as he was car
ried aboard.
For this one day the whole usual social
order was subverted, and Chinamen every
where took precedence of their white
brethren in the good-natured throng that
lined the wharf. it was emphatically
Chinaman's day.
Almost immediately on reaching the
steamer, Li Hung Chang graoted audi
ence in the salocn to a reputation of gor
geously gowned Chinamen, from whom
be received an address read from a scarlet
paper. During the audience his servant
several times put his pipe to his lips, and
all but smoked for the great potentate.
His suite is so ample that about all t-ere
is left for the great man to do is to draw
his own breath.
He appears to be in excellent health and
spirits and full ten years younger than
his pictures lead one to expect. He was
delighted with his transcontinental trip
and expressed a high opinion of Canada,
stating that he thought the Dominion had
a splendid future before it,
As a mark of his appreciation of the
courtesies extended to him by the Cana
dian Pacific Railroad he conferred the or
der ot the Double Dragon upon A. E. La
lande of the passenger department, who
accompanied him on the journey. A simi
lar honor was also bestowed upon Dr.
Horsey, the Canadian Government repre
sentative.

Convention.
LOFTY AIMS OF DEMOCRACY
ABANDONED.

Repudiation and National
Â£ is honor.
NEW YORK, N. V., Bept 13.â Ex-Lie
utenant-Governor W. F. Sheehan yesterday
sent a lonp statement of his views and atti
tude in the campaign to J. B. Mayer of
Buffalo. Mr. Mayer is a prominent Dem
ocrat in his city and waa one of the dele
gates to the Chicago convention last June.
A synopsis of Mr. Sueehan's communica
tion is here given:
New York, Sept. 12, 1896.
Joseph B. Mayer, Esq., Buffalo, N. Kâ Deab
Sir: Replying to your recent letter of Inquiry
as to my attitude in the present campaign, I
beg leave to say :
The" proceedings of the recent Chicago con
vention were unparalleled in Democratic his
tory. Radicalism and not patriotism dominated
its course. The guiding, and in a large measure
the controlling-, spirits of that body were Re
publican United States Senators â men whose
votes made it possible to engraft upon the
statutes ot this country the objectionable ana
disastrous McKinley law. When before were
rock-ribbed RepuDlican protectionists given in
a Democratic convention seats of honor and
permitted to dictate and shape the policy of
our party? The patriotic advice of men who
had grown gray in Democratic service was
spurned and the judgment of these new-found
apostles of an undemocratic creed was enthu
siastically accepted.
After reviewing the official acts of the
convention and its platform in terms as
scathing as any that have been used by
others in the same vein, Mr. Sheenan con
tinues:
Democratic principles took root with theWrth
of the Repu bl ic ; they are as sound and lofty to
daj- as they were when first expounded by Jef
ferson. All Democrats should give their hearty
support to candidates who stand upon a plat
form which reaffirms and upholds these prin
ciples; but when these principles are aban
doned and set aside and new doctrines at vari
ance with National honor and National pro
gress are adopted, do we not cease to be Dem
ocrats if we fail to repudiate that which is un
patriotic and immoral?
What Democratic convention has failed In
recent years to justly condemn Republican pa
ternalism? Where is there a more wicked
form of paternalism than for the Govern
ment to stamp, for the benefit of mine owners,
53 cents worth of silver bullion as $1 in coin?
Where in Democracy is a proposition that al
lows the silver of the world to be coined at our
mints, free of charge, at a ratio far beyond itg
Intrinsic or commercial value, and compels
our citizens to accept this false and dishonest
coin at its face value in extinguishment of
their debts and in payment for their labor?
The advocates of this platform hazard every
thing on the single proposition that the enact
ment of a law for the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1, withoÂ»t the aid or assist
ance of other nations, will bring silver and
gold to a parity.
We consider our silver dollar to-day as good
as gold, because it has back of it the credit and
faith of the Nation pledged to maintain its
parity with gold. Under free coinage this
credit and faith will be withdrawn from the
new coin. These men propose, however, that
the power of Congress shall be exercised to
compel our citizens to accept In payment of
their debts a dollar that is intrinsically worth
but fifty-three cents, withont being able to
compel corresponding relief to the American
debtors when foreign creditors demand of
them payment in gold.
How long will the hum of industry continue ;
how long will the workshop remain open; how
ong will the manufacturer continue to turn
out the product of American genius and skill,
if we have no ioreign trade and are compelled
to buy and sell to ourselves?
We received for the year ending June 30 last
for Koods exported to other nations $863,200,
--467. This enormous sum represents American
capital, product and labor. In our dealings
with all people we should receive and pay the
best money in the world. No law has yet been
able to make all men iionest, but so law should
compel men to be dishonest.
After reciting the debtorship of the
United States for its outstanding bonds of
$850,000,000, for which gold was received
and for which, "unless the intelligence of
this Nation be* blunted and its patriotic
impulses paralyzed," redemption will be
in the same coin, Mr. Sheehan continues:
Nor can the apologist for the Chicago plat
form pettitog or beg the question. When they
rejected the amendment offered by Senator
Hill, to the effect that any change in the pres
ent stmdard of values should not apply to
existing Government bonds, th9y nailed to the
masthead of their ship the inglorious flag of
repudiation and dishonor. Against the perpe
tration of .such a crime in the name of De
mocracy 1 protest.
Who are the owners of these bonds? Not
foreign hankers and home syndicates, not the
so-called bloated bondholder, but the ward
whose education has been provided for in the
supposed inviolability of a United States bond;
the widow whose sole support may be the in
come thus received and 5,000,000 of Ameri
cans who have placed their deposits in our
savings institutions. The deposits are not
stored away in the vaults of savings banks.
That which is not loaned is invested, and most
of it in Government bonds.
1 have heard it said tbat no attempt would
be made to affect any outstanding obligations
if the work of the Chicago convention were
ratified at the polls. The answer is two-fold.
The proposition not to repudiate these obliga
tions was overwhelmingly defeated by the
convention after Mr. Bryan had concluded
the speech which resulted in his nomination.
Under free coinage silver would become the
money of the country. The revenue of the
Government through its customs and internal
revenue would be nothing but silver, or, if the
dream of the Populist be realized, unlimited
Hat paper money with no coin behind it for
redemption. With silver or fiat paper money
as oux only means of revenue, how, I ask the2
apologists for this plank, can these millions
oi United States bonds be redeemed in gold?
With v legitimate proposition to increase the
number of United States Supreme Court
Judges, or to abolish within constitutional
line* life tenure in oftiee, I may have po con
troversy; nor do 1 object to proper criticisms
of Judge* and public oilioials. Bntwhen an
open, bald attempt is made to increase the
number of Judges with the avowed purpose
of securing a decision on any question in a
predetermined way patriotic and intelligent
men may well hold up their hands in horror.
Speaking of the claim of "regularity"
he says:
Does party regularity demand b'.lnd and
stupid allegiance to everything a convention
held under the name of Democracy may do ?
I admit the Impossibility of drawing a plat
form that in all things will be satisfactory to
all Democrats. But never before have we
been esked to make a compromise between
National honor and National degradauon.
Compromises may be made on many matters,
even on the currency issue, but. tbe immorality
and debasement of compromises on questions
that directly affect the Nation's honor and
good faith are not to be considered for a
moment. Tue Democrats who responded to
President Lincoln's call to take up arms for
the maintenance of the Nation's houor did
not cease to be Democrats because ihe.y proved
themselves patriots.
After referring to the condition of the
country and the lack of confidence pre
vailing and to the fact that tne gold neces
sary to start business "is and has been
waiting the settlement of our financial
difficulties along the lines of honor and
reason," Mr. Sueehan says, referring to
the platform of the last Democratic State
Convention in New York:
I stood on that platform then; 1 have never
left it, and Ido not propose to do so now. Let
those whose judgment leads them in a differ
ent direotion support the Chicago nominees.
! believe most firmly that the success of this
Chicago ticket would mean paralysis of busi
ness and that the avenues of industries would
be closed.
After citing the fact, that no existing
power can take from him his credentials
as a member of the Democratic National
Committee unless with his consent, Mr.
Sheehan concludes:
It the State I have the honor to represent
Hands in September where it stood in June I
will gladly continue as its representative on
that committee. But if the organized Democ
racy of the Stute reverses its position, stands
where it should not stand, pulls down the ban
ner of Democracy and hoists the flag of Pop
ulism, I will not continue to represeut it. If
the Buffalo couvention indorses the platform
of the Chicago convention or its nominees my
resignation will be immediately' forwarded to
the National Committee.

MONEST MONEY ADDRESS
Stirring Appeal to the True, Loyal
Democracy.
>KW YORK, N. V., Sept. 13.â The ex
ecutive committee of the Democratic Hon
est Money League to-day issued an ad
dress to the "Honest Money Democracy
of the Nation, who hold country and
honor above party,'' in which they de
nounce the currency and other planks of
the Chicagt) platform. The address con
cludes:
Bna.ll we sacrifice the prestige, character,
standing and influence of this %v^g.t people
that a combination of speculators may profit
by the sacrifice? Shall we permit the Bapreme
Court of this country to Da tampered with
and ita character destroyed that the yoke of
slavery may be permanently riveted about
our necks, and that unbridled license may be
fiven to the enemies of our institutions?

MAINE'S ELECTION TO-DAY.
An Overwhelming Republican Victory
Looked For.
PORTLAND, Me.. Sept. 13.â The cam
paien which closed in this State Saturday
night has been the most active known for
years on both sides. It has been a speak
ing campaign almost entirely, and not a
settlement of any size from one end of
Maine to the other has been neglected.
On the Republican side the speakers in
cluded the most eminent names in the
country. The Republicans are looking
for a victory of most overwhelming pro
portions, their estimates running as high
as 50,000 plurality for Powers, and no one
placing it under 20,000. A conservative
estimate puts it at from 25,000 to 28,000.
The Democrats are eenerally disposed to
concede 20,000 at least. The pluralities
for the four Congressmen to be chosen to
morrow will probably rnn considerably
ahead of the ticket. Mr. Reed's plurality
may go as high as 10,000.

CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 13.â Major Mc-
Kinley enjoyed a well-earned rest to-day.
Yesterday was the most active and la
borious day he has had since his nomina
tion. He made three long and as many
short speeches and shook hands with quite
5000 people. Major McKinley did not go
to Zoar last night, as he had thought one
time of doing. The people gave him no
chance to leave town. He was serenaded
several times during the evening and had
a great many callers at the house.
This morning Major McKinley took a
short drive with Mrs. McKinley and made
a visit to his mother. He did not go to
church. This afternoon he took a long
drive into the country and was much re
freshed by it He is looking well and feel
ing well after his week of arduous work,
and is ready for the still harder work of
next week. The Major will have a larger
numoerof delegations at his house this
week than he has received in the same
length of time since his nomination, and
many of them will be very large delega
tions. The total number of political pil
grims to Canton this week will number
more than 50,000.
Letters asking for dates for delegations
come by every mail. Among those which
will come this week are the following:
Monday, business men and wool-growers
of Harrison County, Ohio. Tuesday, an
excursion of more than 1000 voters from
Somerset County, Pa., and Western Mary
land. Every voting precinct in the county
will be represented. Tuesday afternoon,
the Grand Army posts of Canton and vi
cinity will make a formal call on the can
didate. The same day a large delegation
from Marshall, Mich., will arrive in Can
ton. This delegation will represent the
voters of Calhonn County. Friday, the
great Republican meeting of the campaign
will be held. Speeches will be made Dy
Senators Cullom and Thurston, by Gover
nor Hastings of Pennsylvania and Con
gressman McCleary of Minnesota. Dele
gations from nearly every county in Ohio
are expected in Canton on Friday and
large number of visitors ere coming troni
West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and
Michigan. Arrangements for the accommo
dation of 40,000 visitors are being made.
Next Saturday will be one of the notable
days of the campaign in Canton. Six large
and distinct delegations will visit Major
McKinley. The delegation of Chicago rail
way men, lepresenting all of the railways
which enter Chicago, will number 2500,

will be a delegation from Butler County
and Mercer County, Pennsylvania, a dele
gation composed of commercial travelers
from Pittsburg and vicinity, a delegation
from New Albany, Ind., and one from
Columbus, Ohio, representing the Building
and Trades Council.
News of an encouraging nature was re
ceived from lowa to-day. A poll of all
save twelve counties in tbe State shows
that the voters are two to one for McKin
ley. The twelve counties not polled are
strongly Republican. News from ail parts
of the West is of a cheering character.
Colonel M. T. Herrick of Cleveland ar
rived this evening and spent the night at
the McKinley residence.
Intelligence from Maine to-night indi
cates that a majority exceeding 25,000 will
be given the Republican ticket 10-morrow.

A MANOANESE BOSASXA KING.
Sudden Transition From Poverty to
Great Wealth of a Virginian.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept 13.â A local paper
says: Manganese has made E. R. Brain
erd rich. He is now a bonanza king, and
his good fortune is as unexpected as it is
welcome. Away down in Virginia is a
500-acre tract of land which has restored
Mr. Brainerd to prosperity. It came to
him many years ago in payment of a bad
debt, and because he could not get rid of
it Mr. Brainerd ketit it. Now he is glad
he took it and kepi it.
The most valuable deposit of manganese
ever found in this country has been
found there. A New York firm has offered
to either buy or develop the bonanza and
work will begin at once.
Mr. Brainerd's luck is at Lyndhurst,
Va. Last spring Mr. Brainerd, who has
been a prominent contractor in Chicago
for years, met serious financial reverses
and failed. Now fortune has come again
in a most unexpected manner.
The significant thing about the bonanza
is that the supply is apparently inex
haustible. Manganese is found in many
places in America, but in "pockets."
After being worKed a short time all pre
vious finds have been exhausted. Re
ports from Mr. Braiuerd's land indicate
that tbe iaige supply there is boundless 1 .
Manganese is a metal used chiefly as a
flux in the iron industry, in furnaces, roll
ing-mills and foundries'where pig iron is
converted into the marketable article.
GENERAL JAMES O. MORGAN DEAD
Succumbs to Old Age After a Most
Eventful Career.
QUINCY, 111., Sept. 13.â General James
Dady Morgan died here this morning,
aged 86. He was born in Boston, Mass.,
August 1, 1810. When 16 years of age he
went to sea for a three years' trading voy
age in tue ship Beverly. A mutiny oc
curred when the ship was thirty days out
and the vessel was burned. Morgan es
caped to South America and alter many
hardships returned to Boston. In 1834 he
removed to Quincy, II!., and engaged in
mercantile pursuits. He helped in form
ing the "Quincy Grays," and at the time
of the Mormon troubles in 1844 he was
captain of the Quincy Riflemen and was
ordered to Hancock County to preserve
order.
During the Mexican war he served as a
captain in the First Illinois Volunteers.
In 18G1 he became lieutenant-colonel in
the Seventh Illinois* Regiment and was
promoted brigadier-general of volunteers
July 17, 1862, for meritorious services at
New Madrid and Corinth. In November,
1862, he commanded a brigade at Nash
ville, Term., and was breveted major
general of volunteers March 19 f 1865, for
gallantry at Bentonville, N. C.
He was mustered out of the army Aug
ust 24, 1865. Of late years he had been an
officer of a Quincy bank.
LEADVILLE'S STRIKE.
Married Miners Starved Into Submis-
sion and Trouble is Feared.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept. 13.â The
strike of the Miners' Union will soon cul
minate in a contest between the married
miners and the officials and unmarried
strikers, the former have determined to
go back to work. The Summit and Ham
mines are being inclosed by a high fence
so tuat miners may work behind a barri
cade. The better element of citizens are
beginning to take a more pronounced
stand against the strikers. They per
suuded the county commissioners to hold
a special meeting last eight and take
some action to protect life and preserve
law and order. The meeting was held be
hind closed doors and it is not known
what action was decided upon, but from
indications to-day it seems that they have
decided to await results to-night and if
any violence occurs to petition the Gov
ernor immediately to send the militia.
"SIMPLY A COAL-PASSER."
The Cane of Cholera 'on the Cruiser Bos-
ton at Shanghai.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept 13.-Navy
Department officials express no apprehen
sion whatever in regard to an isolated case
of cholera on the cruiser Boston, reported
from Shanghai in a dispatch to the New
York Times this morning. Michael Sulli
van, the victim, was simply a coal-passer.
Sullivan contracted the disease ashore,
where it is usually to be found in low
quarters. The sanitary condition of tbe
ship is excellent and it is deemed impos
sible for the plague to spread. All precau
tions have been taken, and tbe fact that
several days have elapsed since the re
ported occurrence without any new cases
developing deprives the incident, in the
opinion ot naval officials, of any alarming
significance.
Almost a Tragedy at St. Louis.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept. 13.â A business
difficulty between two prominent citizens
of this city nearly ended in a tragedy yes
terday. Major C. R. Rainwater, a pol
itician, business man and promoter of
large enterprises, attempted to shoot his
former business partner, Simon P.
Boogher, on Washington avenue, yester
day. Litigation followed their business
dissolution and friends of each have pre
dicted a hostile meeting. The police at
tempted to hush the matter up, but Mr.
Boogher demanded tbe punishment of
Major Rainwater. Both gentlemen are oi
the first circles in society.

German Papers Fear Examination of
All Christians in tbe o'toman Em*
pire Will Ba Provoked.
fCopyright,lB96,by the United Associated PresaesJ
BERLIN, Germany, Sept. 13.â The Em
peror will remain several days at Siegs
dorf, where he has gone for the purpose
of snooting, and Prince Hohenlohe will
start to-morrow for his estates in Styria,
where he will engage in the sport of
cdamois- hunting. Prince Radolin, the
German Embassador to Russia, started
for England on Tnursday for the purpose
of transacting private business, and Count
Kapnist, the Russian Embassador to Aus
tria, who is the probable successor of
Prince Lobanoff-Rostovsky as Russian
Minister of Foreign Affairs, has left
Vienna for a sojourn at Biarritz with his
family.
These facts have been gleaned with a
view of gauging the value of the excited
rumors which have been flying abont the
bourses that a political deluge in Turkey
is imminent. Beyond question develop
ments of the most acute nature are near
at hand, but they will not be reached to
day, nor are they likely to manifest them
selves until the Czar's tour 1b finished and
that monarch returns to St. Petersburg.
Lord Salisbury's so-called independent
policy in Turkey, which is doubtless seen
in the action of Sir Philip Cnrrie, the
British Ecabassador at Constantinople, in
presenting to the Porte a not* protesting
against the Government's expulsion of
Armenians from the Turkish capital with
out consulting the representatives of the
powers, is not taken here so seriously as
implying the appearance of a Biitish fleet
in the Bosphorus to enforce the special
British demands, and the absence of sev
eral Embassadors from Constantinople
ought to furnish sufficient proof of the
suspension of the final Turkish crisis.
Sir Philip Currie is the first Ambassador
who has had an audience with the Sultan
since the recent riots in Constantinople.
Baron Calico, tne Austrian Embassador,
and M. Nelidoff, the Russian Embassa
dor, are away on leaves of absence, which
will not expire until the end of the month,
ana Sir Philip Currie. in the meantime, is
in command of tne diplomatic field with
whatever kind of isolated policy he has to
push forward. No well-informed diplo
mats here believe that independent action
on the part of Great Britain is practical.
Though the Nonh German Gazette,
whose articles of the Turkish situation
are callous and unsympathetic with the
persecuted Armenians, represents the
best official opinion here, the other influ
ential journals take an entirely different
course. The Cologne Gazette declares
that tne powers want to deal energetically
with the Sultan, but are undecided as to
the method of doing so.
"Though the last massacre in Constanti
nople passed over the European residents
of the city." the Gazette adds, "as the
fear and hatred of Christians increase the
powers must face a possible general massa
cre."
The Kreuz Zeitung and other papers
discuss the measures that must be taken
before armed intervention ought to be
resorted to. but almost every newspaper
comment on the situation reasons upon
the readiness of the Turks to try to exter
minate the Christians in Turkey if they
are provoked.
Advices received here from Constanti
nople assert that the Sultan is afflicted
with a homicidal mania arising from an
acute spinal disease, and the statements
made in these advices seem, according to
the criticisms of the press, to be associated
with the maniacal outburst of Turkish
fanaticism generally. How to guard
against such an outburst is the nrÂ«it ques
tion to be placed before the foreign diplo
mats in Turkey. If tbe powers agree to
j'lace the Sultan under tutelage, with the
appointment of Turkish Ministers and
other officials, approved by the Embassa
dors, this action must be accompanied by
preparations for armed occupation of Tur
key.
Tbe Kreuz Zeitung asserts that France
and Russia will never assent to the plan
of placing the Sultan under tutelage and
will maintain the integrity of tbe empire
and sovereignty of the Turkish monarch,
and declares that these two powers al
ready distrust the concentration of the
British fleet at Balonica. The sum of the
situation is that these and other proposals
dealing with the Sultan await the issues
of the Czar's tour.
In the meantime the Czar and Czarina,
with their suites, are atÃernstorf castle in
Denmark, wtiere the King ot Denmark's
family party is assembled. The Czar,
FnnceÂ«s Victoria and Prinoe Wai demur of
Denmark are accustomed to go bicycling
each morning, while the Czarina, the
Princess of Wales and the Queen of Den
mark drive along the routes taken by the
cyclists. In the afternoon tde Czar, the
Crown Prince of Denmark and the Grand
Duke Michael of Russia go ont to the
deer drives in Jsegersborg Park, and
the evenings are Bpent in the enjoyment
of musical entertainments for the family
party, which will break up on September
16, the Czar and Czarina going to Bal
moral to visit Queen Victoria, accom
panied by the PrineeÂ»s of Wales and her
daughter, Princess Viotoria.
The representatives of the press return-
Ing from Goerlitz oonour in the statement
that it was with the utmost difficulty that
they were able to get. accurate informa
tion of the results of the military maneu
vers, but agree that the general results
were more favorable to the Baxon tban
the Prussian army corps. The Emperor,
upon the evening of every day of the ma
neuvers, criticized the operations with ad
mitted impartiality. The Prussian in
fantry, which are renowned for their good
marching under heavy weights, main
tained the reputation. Both the Prussians
and the Saxons carried over sixty pounds,
consisting of arms, ammunition, knap
sack and part of a tent per man, yet their
files were closed up well at the end of
every day. For the first time the bicycle
riflemen were brought into action, cover
ing the Prussian cavalry behind Klein
Bautzen.
Military experts alone, however, can say
whether their work was done effectively.
It was generally stated on the field that
General Covnt Waldersee bad underrated
the marching abilities of tbe Saxons, who
throughout were admirably led. The com
missariat was marvelously well managed
and the quantity ana quality of the food
provided excellent.
A cumber of German Catholic clergy
men will attend the anti-Masonic con
gress, which is to be opened at Trent on
September 26. Prince Charles Valuisi,
Bishop of Trent, will preside after the con
gress has been formally opened by Cardi
nal Agliardo, Papal Nuncio to Vierina.who
will read a letter from the Pope. Cardinal
Agliardo has caused the publication of the
letter of his Holiness in the Centrist news
papers. Tbe Pope recalls the dangers re
sulting from secret societies, as denounced
in the Encyclique Humanum Genus, and
declares that r"ree Masonry is more per
nicious than ever, menacing both church
and state.
He expresses hope that the congress will
find means to stop the progress cf this ma-
Jigr.ant enemy of society. The letter does
not affect German Free Masonry, which is
non-sectarian and non-political, being or
ganized for merely social and charitable
purposes.
Another advance in the discount rate of

Herren Bebel and Bueb, the Socialist
leaders in the Reichstag, have been pre

that they have decided to hold a large
meeting in Buden, near Strasburg.
The subsidence of the Bohemian town
of Bonex continues. The sinking of the
town is due to the falling in of olu mineÂ«,

Recent visitors to Friedrichsruhe say
that Prince Bismarck, contrary to current

The Strasburg Burger Zeitung announces
that ex-Empress Eugenic is troing to Al

mies in 1870.
VALLEJO NOT A JERICHO.
Presiding Elder Willis' Charge
Arouse the Wrath of
Citizens.
Denials of the Accusation That the
Peope of the Town
Are Ungodly.
VALLEJO, Cal., Sept. 13. â Church
going people, irrespective of denomina
tion, as well as the citizens generally,
are much exercised over the statement
made by Rev. E. R. Willif", presiding elder
of the Napa district, in the Methodist con
ference at Pacific Grove on the 10th inst.,
in. which be said:
"The word Vallejo is not synonymous,
with righteousness. King Alcohol is on
the throne. Tbe city stands because there
are more than ten righteous ones in it.
To find a man at the mourner's bench in
Vallejo would surprise the people more
than an earthquake."
The average Vallejoite is willing to ad
mit that there are here a few saloons
more than are actually required, but a
statement insinuating that the number of
good people is not more than ten is re
pudiated as being untrue, malicious and
uncalled for, nor do the people enjoy be
ing called modern Jerichoites. One of the
pastors who has been here for a number
of years says that his congregations are
large and that the people are both intel
lectual and spiritual. '* In no other place
did he have more liberal support than in
Vall-jo. J_^_
"I have baptized sixty -five into the
Cornell Baptist Church since I have been
pastor," said the Rev. W. L. Gaston, "and
this doej not include a large number of
'backsliders' who have been reclaimed."
Rev. Theodore F. Burn ham, pastor of
the Presbyterian Church, says his congre
gation is increasing so rapidly that there
is a plan on foot to enlarge the seating
capacity in the church. The Catholic
church is filled with members at each ser
vice, and the Episcopal church is well at
tended. Last Sunday night the Methodist
church was crowded to the doors and the
aisles were filled with chairs to accommo
date those who gathered to listen to the
closing sÂ»rmon by Rev. Mr. Woodward,
the retiring pastor. During his address
Mr. Woodward took occasion to thank tbe
people for the very kind attention that
had been given him during his two years'
stay and the cordial relations existing be
tween the various churches.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 13â Everything

SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 13.â Sherifi Lyn
don is anxiously awaiting the arrival of
the photographs of Michael O. Henry, the
Dunham suspect arrested at Ouray, Colo.,

description of the man when compared
with that of the Campbell murderer, but
not enough to warrant the assertion that
the man is not Dunham. W. C. Stiteler,
who caused the suspect's arrest, and Sher
iff Ben ton of Ouray are positive their cap*
tive is the fugitive. The pictures will ar
rive here on vVednesday or Thursday and
if they bear a strong resemblance to Dun
bam a man will be sent to Ouray to iden
tify him.

Carcusal in a Liquor
Store.
HOLLISTER, Cal., Sept 13. â A
friendly wrestling match between Logan
Cornweil and George Smith at SanÃenito,
thirty miles south of here, last night
ended in the killing of Cornweil by Smith.
Beguu in good-natured rivalry, it became
a serious affair, when one or bctn of the
contestants forgot friendship and turned
tbe match into a rough-and-tumble fight.
George Taylor, Harry Mead, George
Smith and Logan Cornweil spent the
evening at a saloon and about 9 o'clock
started for home. Alter leaving the saloon
Cornweil and Smith engaged in the wres
tling match, and Cornweil threw Smith.
They then started fortlieir horses, hitched
near by, when Smith went up to Cornweil
and said:
"You may be able to throw me, but I
can get away with you some other way."
Cornweil aeain took hold of Smith and
another scuffle followed, both men falling
heavily to the ground. Smith claims that
Cornweil, who had hold of his left hand,
struck him in tbe face as they fell, and
that he said to Cornweil: "If you hit me
again I will cut you," at the same time
drawing a common pocket-kniie.
He says Cornweil struck him again, and
he then plunged the knite into Cornwell's
body. Four wounds were inflicted â two
deep gashes just below the ribs, a slight
cut a few inches higher and a stab directly
over the heart
Cornweil raised to a standing position,
staggered back about twelve feet and
dropped dead. His only words were,
"Yes, I am badly hurt," In response to a
question from one of the party.
The principals in the affair were both
young men, 32 years old, well connected
and well known in this community. Smith
was brought to town and is now in the
county jaii.

Dye, pastor of the Baptist church at Los
Angeles, who has been granted a furlough

speaker said that there need be no fear of
danger irom Mexican silver, even if the
importation of foreign metal was to be
feared at all, because all the coined silver
in that country, if sent to the United
States, would be less than $1 per capita.

IN SAN DIEGO
James Rust's Long Search
for a Daughter Is
Ended.
SEPARATED YEARS AGO.
Poverty Forced Him to Send the
Girl Out to Earn a
Living.
HE GAINS WEALTH AT MINING.
The Wife Who Deserted Him Found
Bearing the Name of
Another Man.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 13.-After a
long search, involving a trip by buckboard
from Seattle to this city, over 1200 miles,
James Rust has found ais 17-year-old
daughter Jenny, and both are supremely
happy. They were separated ten years
ago, when Rust was miserably poor and
Jenny was a little foundling, and they
meet now, Jenny a beautiful girl "budding
into womanhood and her fatner a rich
man.
It was in 1886, ten years ago almost to a
day, when Rust, a poor carpenter, was
forced to see his children sent out to make
their own way in the world, wnile he went
away seeking a livelihood. The bulk of his
misfortune was caused by a faithle*3 wife.
She was a Mexican woman, gifted with
unusual beauty, and when poverty came
and five children had to be fed, she proved
recreant and left her husband and babes.
She wag afterward located north of this
city, where she had married a rancher.
Jenny was the youngest child. As the
others grew up they made their own way,
and most of them married. One lives in
Bakersfield and oihers are scattered
through the State.
Jennie was adopted by Alexander Beller
and wife, who live at Encinitas, thirty miles
north of San Diego. As she grew up she
became known far and wide as one of the
prettiest girls in the county, her features
blending the American and Castilian
types with rare charm and beauty.
Rust was completely disheartened. He
drifted to Arizona, and worked for a while
at Wickenburg and Congress, picking up
a good deal of information about mining.
Then he went Nortb, and East, and
North again. He lost track of his children
completely, and for a time was so poor
that he was forced to tramp with hobos
and hard characters over the oountry. Up
in Idaho he ran across something that
looked like a good thing in mining, and
he stayed there awhile. .Fortune seemed
to be against ! im, but be stucK to it until
he made a little start. He then went into
the State of Washington, and found two
or ihree mines that yielded a small sum.
He continued prospecting, and after
niue years of struggling he found what
he had been seeking, a rich mine. He
developed it considerably, and when a
syndicate wanted to bond it he accepted
their offer and left the camp a rich man.
even if the mine turns out to be worth
nothing.
Ttien Rust resolved on the journey down
through Oregon and California. He pur
chased a stout bucsboard and a fine
horse and left Seattle on July 8, bound
for San Diego. He had obtained the ad
dress of one of his children at Bakersfield,
and so far as he could learn his pet daugh
ter, Jenny, was still at the home of her
adoption in this county. On the way
aown he ran across two other married
childrenâ a son and daughter.
Rust drove ur> to the Beller ranch, near
Encinitas, last Sunday, and asked for his
daughter. Mrs. Beller had completely
forgotten him, but recognized him after
he told his story. An old ranchhand on
the place recognized Rust immediately,
and they haa a good talk over old times.
But the anxious father was much cast
down wfien Mrs. Boiler told him that his
daughter was in San Diego and had been
here for two weeks. Rust jumped into his
buckboard and turned his jaded horse
toward San Diego. He had learned that
Jenny was safe, happy and almost & grown
woman, and this made him still more
anxious to see her.
On the way down Rust had lost his
way, and inquired of a passing rancher
the name of the people living at a house
near by. The rancher gave the informa
tion, which nearly knocked Rust off his
seat. It was the home of his erring wife.
The rancher replied to Rust's questions]
ana told nim that the woman had three
children since she remarried.
Rust did not turn aside to renew ac
quaintanceship with his wife, for obvious
reasons. Pushing on to this cnv he
hunted up the address given by "Mrs.
Beller and had the supreme satisfaction
that night of claspine his daughter in his
arms. Her beauty and womanliness gave
her an added charm and he was loath to
leave her, even to rest after his long
journey.
Rust and his daughter are still in this
city and be is making plans for their fu
ture. One thing, he says, is sure, and that
is that Jenny will have as fine an educa
tion as monsy will procure, and another,
that she shall not marry for a while yet.
He wants her all to himself, he says, to
pay him for the dart experiences of both
during the past ten years.
SMELTER FOR VANCOUVER.
Prospects of the Early Establishment of
a Large Plant.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Sept. 13.-Pro
vided satisfactory freight arrangements
can be made with the Canadian Pacific
Railroad, a large ore smelter and refinery
will be established herewith a capital of at
least $1,000,000. W. R. Rust of the Tacoma
smelter is tne organizer of the project,
which will have behind it American and
British capital. Municipal and electoral
assent will be required to procure the
grant of free city water and tax exemp
tion for ten years, and a civic bonus of
$100 000 will be another condition of the
local settlement of the new industry.
In consideration of these privileges
worth together over " $140.000â the com
pany will undertake to treat at least
000 tons of ore per annum, the works to
have a capacity ol 60,000 tons yearly and
to employ all white labor, Chinese and
Japanese being rigidly excluded. Ample
ore supplies can be obtained from Trail
Creek and the Slocan country, while in
the early future coast ores will also be ob
tainable in abundance.

THE BERING SEA PATROL
Revenue Cutters of the American Fleet in
Northern Waters Will Soon
Disband.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., SÂ«pt. 13.â
According to private advices via the
steamer Al-Ki, the Bering Sea fleet will
disband at an early daie and return to
civilization after a five months' patrol,
daring which a number of seizures were
made. The letter is from the Corwin, and
states that that vessel will leave Unalaska
on the 20th insU ' Instead of coming to
Port Townsend, as usual, the Corwin will
proceed direct to San Francisco, not even
stopping at Sitka. The reason for this is
that Captain Hooper, commanding the
squadron, will be aboard, and will pro
ceed to Washington City to make his re
port of ttie season's work without any un
necessary delay. The run down should
consume about ten days, which will bring
the Corwin to San Francisco by the first ot
October.
In view of the fact that Commander
Hooper is aboard the Corwin, that will
probably be the last vessel to leave the
sea. The other vessels of the fleet, all of
which will put in here, may be expected
bj the 20th or 2.5 th at tne latest.
The Wolcott, alter the fleet is broken up,
will proceed to Sitka, thence to this port.
It is detailed for tiie winter at Whatcom.
TneÃ'-arand Grant are both coming to
Port Townsend. The Corwin will go to
San Diego to protect the southern boun
dary until spring. The Rush is to be sta
tioned at San Francisco until the fleet as
sem Dies again. Tne Perry i 3 to winter at

COOKS INLET CONDITIONS
Stories of Suffering Denied by a
Man Just Eack From
the North.
Late Comers Have Not Prospered
Because Tkty Fonnd the Best
Claims Taken.
PORTLAND, Ob., Sept 13.â Oscar Beer
; has just returned from Alaska, and gives
j an authentic account of what he has seen,
differing materially from those of others.
"When I left Cooks Inlet on August
21," says he, "tnere were still about 800 or
900 miners in that region. Earlier in the
season there were several thousand, but
the stories published about so many being
penned up there, hundreds of miles from
civilization, without prospect of getting
away, and being in danger of starvation
or freezing this winter, are quite untrue.
The thousands have dwindled now proba
bly to a few hundred, who can still get
away, but many will winter there in order
to be on hand to work their claims in the
spring. It is quite true that the region
I has proved the reverse of profitable to all
: but a few of those who have gone there
I this year, for nearly ail the good claims
j had already been locatJd last year.
"The few claims located in 1595 were
mostly profitable ana everybody looked
for big developments this year, but while
j the whole conntry is so full of gold that
I a miner can find colors anywhere, the
! metal is all on the surface, and only a
: few pockets ha~e paid for the time and la
', bor of the miner. Some claims have aver
| aged as high as $50 to $100 a day to the
| man, after the preliminary wort was done.
"For those who may thins of going to
I Cooks Inlet in the future, I wish to say a
j word of warning about the dangers of
; Turnagain Arm. As far as I know, twen
i ty-hve to thirty people have been drowned
| in those treacherous waters â how many
! more no one knows. Wrecked boats and
water-soaked provisions cast ashore tell
many a sad story. When the tide turns a
huge wave, sometime? ten feet high, comes
sweeping on with ttie force and thunder
of an avalanche, at the rate of twenty
i miles an hour, everwhelming any small
I boat. They call this the 'first bore,' but
I tne second and third "bores' following it are
also dangerous, and no experienced man
j ventures forth in a Doat until these are
i past."
JAILED AT LOS ANGELES.
McCarthy, the Bank Robber Suspect,
riacd Behind the Bars.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 13.â John
J. McCarty, alias Bigelow, recently ar
rested in San Francisco for complicity in
the attempt to rob the First National Bank
! here, in now in the city jail. Detective
Bradish reached the city with the ex-pugi
list this afternoon. Some members of the
i police force recognized the prisoner as the
j pugilist who participated in a sparring
match before the athletic club here some
time aj:o. There will be no trouble in es
tablishing the fact that McCarthy was in
Los Angeles about the time the tunnel
was being dug to the basement of the
back. And in the opinion of ttie police
there will be no difficulty in connecting
both Jones and McCarthy with the at
j tempted crime.
Stockton Wins From Company F.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 13.â A large
crowd saw the Stockton players beat Com
pany F of San Francisco this afternoon by
a score of 12 to 5. F. Pace, a brother of
Russ Pace, played his initial game, mak
ing a flattering debut. He made no errors
and showed himself to be a good batter
and baser unner. The features of the game
were the faultless fielding of "Babe"
White, shortstop of the Stocktons, and
the batting of McDaaiels of Company F.
Both pitchers were unsteady and played a
poor game. In the eighth innin? the Sar
Franciscans threw the ball all over the
grounds.

FAIR PASADENA'S
RAPID GROWTH
Steadily Gaining in Area,
Population, Wealth
and Fame.
HAS HOMES FOR MANY.
Eastern Visitors Attracted by
tne City's Beauty and
Its Climate.
NESTLES AMID OEANGE GROVES
Picturesque Scenery and a Semi-
Tropical Verdure a Revelation
to Tourists.
PASADENA, Cal., Sept. 12. â Some
twenty-two years ago the great stretch of
mesa land north of Los Angeles, at the
foot of the Sierra Madre Mountains, and
Handsome Structures That Grace the Streets of Beautiful Pasadena.
lying at the west end of the great San
Gabriel Valley, was purchased from own
ers who bad used it as a sheep ranch, for
the purpose of growing fruit. It then be
came known as the Indiana Colony, for
the reason that most ol the men inter
ested came from the State of Indiana.
In the year 1873 articles of incorporation
were adopted under the name of the San
Gabriel Orange Grove Association.
The land was surveyed and laid off into
ranches of from ten to forty or more acres.
The owners went to work grading roads
and developing water in the Arroyo Seco
canyon. A large portion of this land was
set oat to frnit.
About 1882 the beautiful and healthy lo
cation and the progressive character of
the residents, together with its proximity
to Los Angeles, began to attract the atten
tion of others who desired more partic
ularly a home where healtn, comfort and
pleasure might be had. The orchards be
gan to be divided up into lots for homes,
new streets were laid out, and the popula
tion very rapidly increased.
People from .all parts of the United
States came to Southern California, at
tracted by the accounts of its beauty,
health and fruitfulness, and a large per
centage of them were tilled with enthusi
asm for Pasadena. When the great real
estate boom broke out Pasadena became
one of the leading centers of activity.
Thosa times were very exciting to the
participants, and are to-day a source of
amusing and instructive anecdote.
After the collapse of the boom and slow
recovery from the consequent depression
Pasad na entered upon a permanent and
healthy growth of a surprising character.
Kepresenta tires of the best and most valu
able citizens came there from all of the
Eastern States, bringing wealth, culture
and refinement with them whic!) ex
pressed itself in beautiful homes sur
rounded by luxurious foliage and spread
ing lawns. Churcbes representing all de
nominations were built; grand school
houses modern in the highest degree, a
public library of rough stone and impop
ing architecture and the buildings of the
Throop Polytechnic Institute, a manual
training school and college founded by
"Father" Throop, a Chicago gentleman
who loves his adopted home and mankind.
Streets were laid out in every direction]
graded, carberl, graded and lined with
cement sidewalks.
Now one may live two miles from the
center and go to his home over well-kept
streets and there enjoy every modern con
I venience that is known in the most ad
vanced Eastern city.
Stretching away from Pasadena toward
the mountains and south and east into the
San Gabriel Valley are ranches producing
fruit of all sorts.
These ranches' are uniformly beautiful
to look at and profitable to their owners.
The system of drives through this coun
try is remarkably attractive to all, espe
cially to the Eastern tourist, who finds in
them a revelation In the way of beautiful
f-cenery and semi-tropical" growth that
makes the beholder for the first time think
that verily the happy valley has been
found where peace, plenty and health
abound. About 100 carloads of oranges
annually are shipped from this district.
From 4000 to 5000 tons of creen fruits
are dried and canned each year, mostly
peaches, apricots and prunes. Berries are
cultivated the entire year and are gen
| erally plentiful and cheap.
The water supply has kept pace with
j the demand by development from year to
year, and is used for domestic purposes
and for irrigating citrui fruits, which
have an extent of about 2000 acres. The
water is pure and healthful and reason
! able in cost. The land not planted to
fruit trees is used for barley and wheat,
which matures in April or May, and for
alfalfa, which produces from six to eight
crops a year. Veeetables are of the best,
cheap and plentiful.
The business interests of Pasadena have
kept up with the growth of the city.
There are, in addition to a fruit cannery,
two large mills for the manufacture of all
kinds of woodwork for use in building op
erations, a manufactory for false teeth and
other dental goods, a boot and shoe fac
tory that is growing into an institution of
importance. There are four or five well
stocked lumber yards.
Brick of the best kind is manufactured
both for home use and for shipping. The
manufacture of gas and wood stoves is
carried on by the owners of the city gas
I worKs. Every branch of retail business is
represented, and the merchants carry
I large stocks of goods for sale at prices
which enable them to compete with the
L.os "Angeles merchants. There are four
banks, two National and two State banks,
with an aggregate capital of $300,000.
The expansion of business during the
last two years has compelled the building
of large and beautiful modern business
blocks, which add to the diunity and at
tractiveness of the city. Several hundred
thousand dollars have been expended in
public improvements â paving sidewalks,
grading streets, curbing and guttering and
sewer construction. The water supply, as
before stated, comes from the mountains
in iron pipes and is stored in covered
reservoirs.
The city has an excellent sewer system,
a compl tely equipped Fire Department
and a hrst-class electric light plant. The
streets are well lighted by electricity.
The Santa Fe, tne Southern Pacific and
Terminal railroads afford the very best
facilities for freight and passeneer traffic,
while the Pasadena and Los Angeles
Electric Railroad gives frequent transit
between Pasadena and L,os Angeles and
Santa Monica, a popular seaside resort.
The leadine fraternal societies of the
country are represented in Pasadena by
well-conaucted chapters and lodges, and
there are a number of social organizations
which are prosperous and growing.
There is a Hoard of Trade with a mem
bership of about 275, which has a room
well furnished and equipped for the use of
strangers in the city, where general infor
mation may be had of the secretary re
garding Pasadena ana Southern California
affairs.
Real estate values in Pasadena have
slowly and safely advanced in response to
an increasing demand by the people who
buy homes.
Tne high class of houses, both in point
of cost and artistic effect and beautiful
grounds, compare favorabh- with the best
suburbs of Uoston or Hew York.
The city has two resilience sections, the
east and west side. So close are the
competing advantages that property of
the same grade is very nearly the same in
price, while North Pasadena is improv
ing rapidly, esp-cially at the present time
which is largely due to the building of the
electric road through that section up to
Altader.a, a suburb at the foot of the
mountains, where many luxurious homes
have been erected in very extensive
grounds.
From here the Mount Low Railroad ex
tends as far as Alpine Tavern. This road
is one of the most celebrated mountain
railroads in the world. It runs from Alta
dena up the Rubio Canyon to the Rubio
pavilion at the foot of the incline. From
that point it extends up an incline at a 60
per cent grade to the top of Echo Moun
tain, where there is a large and elegant
modern hotel, a first-class astronomical
observatory, searchlight and other attrac
tions that are instructive and curious
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1896.
From this it extends up to Alpine Tavern,
a m untain hotel unique in character, in
what is called Grand Canyon and near the
summit of Observation Point. This enter
t>rise is one that the people of (Southern
California have just pride in.
There are two daily newspapers pub
lished in Pasadenaâ the Evening Star and
the Evening News; also the Weekly Star
and Town Talk.
There are many hotels, the most promi
nent being the Hotel Green, the Carlton,
Painter, Hotel Mitchel, Spalding, Casa
Grande, Crown Villa and others. There
is also a large and beautiful opera-house,
complete in all of its appointments.
The proximity of Pasadena to Los An
geles and the facility for going back and
forth induce many people doing business
in that city to make their homes in
Pa c a Icna on account of its climate,
schools, social advantages and freedom
from the uÂ«ual drawbacks of life in a city.
In fact, Pasadena combines all the ad
vantages of an ideal home, having all the
conveniences of a city and the quiet and
restful character of life in the country,
combined with ample opportunity for
social enjoyment of a high order.
These advantages have' attracted to Pas
adena a large number of people who have
National reputations in the fields of art
and literature, five books having been
published by Pasadena authors during
the last year. This nucleus will undoubt
edly enlarge till Pasadena becomes the
center of art and 1 terature of the Pacific
Coast. Its location makes it accessible in
a short time to the sea or the mountain s.
For a small sum of money and the cost of
a short time one may bathe in the break
ers of the Pacific Ocean or gaze in rapture
from the summit of Mount Wilson, which
is reached by a well-kept trail and pro
vided with comfortable quarters for tour
ists. Eastern tourists come year after year
with renewed delight to this beautiful
ppot till its charms bewitch them away
from their old associations into making
their permanent home. Those who know
it best love it most; those who first see it
never forget it. C. D. Dagqett.

MRS. COOPER'S BIBLE CLASS.
He Enjoys Much Who Is Thankful for
Little.
A very large class was in attend
ance ai Native Sons' Hall yesterday and
many visitors from the East were present.
The lesson was based on second Samuel,
xxii: 40-51. "We are coming," said Mrs.
Cooper, "to close of a most remarkable
life. Dear oldrDavid ! See him; his beauty
faded, wrinkled but fair. Grief has written
its lines all over his face, and sorrow is
tupging at his heart. Chastened, mel
lowed and subdued, the shepherd boy is a
prematurely old man. The lesson con
tains the last words of David. .Line the
last words of Jacob and of Moses they have
a sort of testamentary character. David's
last words were full of gratitude for God's
mercies. There is all the difference in the
world between a man's last words and the
last of a man's words. It is not possible
to foretell when there shall be the last
of a man's words. That will depend upon
the personal character of the man who ut
ters them. We shall never hear the last
of David's words although we have here
in our lesson the last words of David. Our
own words, as inspired by our lives and
characters, shall last for good or for ill
Ions; after our last words have been spok
en. The important question is: What
shall be the lasting influence of our words
and of our deeds?"

PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 13.â The
Sabbath here was one long day of praise,
Methodists and Methodism have not had
such a season of religious uplifting during
the conference as they had to-day. The
Sabbath is usually a great day at confer
ence, and this was no exception. For
sc rcely an hour from 6 o'clock in the
morning, wh*n there was a prayer-meet
ing, to 10 o'clock to-night, was the church
without a meeting of some kind.
The largest congregations of the week
assembled at the conference love feast at 9
o'clock, and to hear the Bishop's sermon
at 11 o'clo. k. The love feast had all the
fervor of the pentecostal meetings that
have been held late every afternoon. The
testimonials to the love and saving power
of Christ came as rapidly as the leader,
Rev. Dr. Cuse, could recognize the wit
nesses for Jesus. Many remained standing
on their feet for many minutes in order to
be recognized. Songs were sung and
prayers, eloquent with feeling, were lifted
to the great, wiii'e throne.
When Bishop Fobs appeared on the plat
form a few more worshipers crowded into
the gallery and those who stood were
pushed further down the ais'es by new
comers. Chairs from neighboring bowses
were brought in and set in the assies. Rev.
Dr. Eli McCiish, president of the Univer
sity of the Pacific, made the opening
prayer. There was a hymn and B.stiop
Foss read scripture iessons from Psalm C
and Hebrews I. Following a hymn the
Bishop announced his text:
Jesus aoked them saying, What think ye of
Christ? Whose son is he?â Matthew, xxii :41-42.
The sermon was devoted to proving that
Jhrist really lived on earth, that he was
divine and that he has power to save men.
It was frequently int. rspersed with such
fervent amens as come oniy from a Metho
dist audience. It was a powerlul and very
interesting sermon.
"In tne day of judgment," said the
Bishop, "it will be found that every man's
destiny will be determined by his relation
to Jesua Christ. So men are inquirine
about him and asking: Whose son ts he?
H>9 name, I ask you, what think ye of
Christ?" J
The Bishop showed from profane his
toryâfrom Tacitus' and Gibbous' accounts
of the burning of Rome by Nero and the
killing of the Christiansâ that such a man
as Jesus did live, and only thirty-five
years before, and that pagan history as
well as sacred hooks proved it.
"Christianity is," he said, "and the
question is. What do you propose to do
about it? Is Christ risen from the dead?
I reverently say I've talked with him this
morning. Oh, come to the Lord to-day."
"All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name"
was the closing hymn, sung with a vol
ume that welled out the windows and
floated far down the grove to tne shore of
th sea. The Bishop pronounced the
benediction.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the most
inu re6sive service of the day was held. It
was the ordination of young ministers as
elder.- and deacons. Ti.ose to be ordained
as deacons were Revs. L. M. Burwell, N.
A. Kennedy, W. N. Marshall, E. Â±J. Win
ning, John J. Pardee; as eldersâ Revs.
Georce W. Beatty, H. F. Brifgp, G. M.
Richmond, W. F. Kurnow, Joseph Lon*"
C. K. Jetiness, Tokutaro Nakamura.
Secretary A H. Needham, Presiding El
der Willis, Rev. Me3srs. Pettis, Harris,
Briggs, Gober and Clifford assisted Bishop
Foss. The elders stood on the r ght hand
and the deacons on the left. The bis. op
read from the Discipline and the classes
answered, reading from the Discipline.
The bishop stated tnat the members of the
classes had been lawfully called, and then
asked in an imi ressive voice if there was
one present who had aught to say against
them. A hush as still as a church at mid
night fell on the congregation ; not a voice
was heard. The bishop then laid his
hands on the head of each candidate and
blessed him, and told him to be ever ready
to spread t.e word of God. Some of the
ministers assisted the bishop in the laying
on of hands.
The bishop finally pronounced a bene
dic ion upon them Â«'in the name of the
i-ather, Hon and Holy Ghost." Then fol
lowed a memorial service, in which eulo
pies In honor of the memory of two min
isters ol the conference who had died
during the year were pronounced.
Rev. W. R. Gober delivered a memorial

sermon on Rev. J. M. Hinman, who died
on January 14 last at Sheridan, and Rev.
C. V. Anthony preached the sermon in
memory of Rev. C. H. Atfl rbach, who
died on January 26 last at San Jose. Tes
timonials to the i-reat worth of the de
parted breihren were offered by Rev.
Messrs. Brigirs, Angwin and Willis.
The deaconesses |held an open-air meet
ing at 6 o'c ock in front of the postotfice
on Lighthouse avenue, the main street,
which was largely attended. At its con
clusion they marched, singing, to the
chu:ch.
In the evening the conference Epworth
League neld a successful meetins. Toward
the close tuliy sixty persons knelt, weep
ing, at the mourueri' bench, and there
were about thirty conversions. A3 one
said:
"The spirit of the Lord seemed to de
scend on the unconverted in the audience
and drive them to the mercy seat."
Afterward there was a feast of rejoicing
and experience-teiling. At 11 o'clock to
night lights in church windows told that
it was still going on. Evangelists A. C.
Bane and D. Osborne, who are attending
the conference, said this evening that this
is the most spiritual conference they have
attended in years.
Rc-v. M. D. Buck presided at the Ep
worth League meeting, and among those
who made addresses or prayers were Rolla
V. Wait, Rev. Jesse Smith, G. \V. Beatty
and Deaconess Benson. Mr. Watt's ad
dress was on "How to Interest Youtic Men
in Christian Work." It was unique and
entertaining. C. B. Perkins introduced a
resolution indorsing and welcoming the
Christian Endeavor convention to San
Francisco in 1897, which was adopted.
To-morrow will be the last day of a very
success;ul conference. Many souls have
been brought to Christ, and a large sum
of money has been raised for charity and
conference work.
The appointments for the coming con
ference year will be announced by the
bishop to-morrow night. The place of
holding the next conference will also De
settled. It is understood that Shasta Re
treat and Ukiah will have champions, but
it is said that there is no doubt that
Pacific Grove will be again chosen on
account of its peculiar and general fitness.
On Tuesday a large number of ministers
and laymen will go to College Park, when
Dr. Eh McChsh will be inaugurated as
president of the University of the Pacific,

OF THE STATE
The recent military conference, in which l
Governor Budd, Major-General James and |
the Attorney-General of the State partici- j
pated, adjusted some disputed points in
favor of the division commander. In due
time the vacancies on the division staff will
be tilled to the entire satisfaction of the
guard.
The chief interest at present centers in
the shooting practice of the i:uard. Re
ports received last week by Colonel Cur
rier, adjutant-jzenerai of the division, tend
to show that defective ammunition has
been supplied to the guard.
First Brigade.
John L. A. Last, major and inspector of
rifle practice, First Brigade, recommends
that companies be provided with funds
and tools with wlrch to loarl their own
shells, or that the best purchasable ammu
nition be furnished to them, and that the
months of May and October be faxed for
the parades for target practice for this
brigade. "The nearer we can conform to
the regulations governine the reguiar
army the more benefit will be derived."
The First Brigade inspector of rifle prac
tice also says:
"The ammunition used for the annusl
preliminary rifle practice this year was
manufactured by the United States Cart
ridge Company, and furnished by the
htate. It was of very poor quality, many
of the balls being braised, which prevented
: .curate shooting, and the barrels of pis
tola and r.fles would become'leaded'af
ter ririnp: four or five shots, which also
] revented good scores being made. Some
of the ammunition furnished was exam
ined in this city (Los Angeles), and the
powder found to be dirty and of inferior
quality, poorly loaded anrt in some in
stances short of quantity. The cost of this
ammunition is to me unknown."
BAK BERNARDINO, Cal., Bept. 10.â
The moot court of the I'hilopolemical

house on that evening, thus necessitating
an adjournment of the session for a month.
Lieutenant Seccom be returned Monday
from a few day*' outing at Santa Monica
wjth Seretant-Major Perdew and li. H.
Wight, both of whom are old members of
the company.
There are rumors of an approaching
resignation and election in tne Seventh
Reciment, Lieutenant-Colonel T. A. Ner
ney is now living in the northern part of
tte State, ana it is eenernlly understood
that he will forward his resignation to
headquarters at an early date, if it is not
already tbere, and that an election will be
called 'o fill the vacancy. Candidates for
the office are already in the field, and the
regular log-rolling that precedes evpry
election in the regiment has commenced
in earnest.
Major J. W. F. Diss, brigade inspector,
would like to bear the siiver ieaveÃ. as
would ex-Colonel Schreiber of the old
Seventh.
The non-com? are taking up their fall
work with n will, and the splendid show
ing made by them at the Thursday even
ing schools is satisfactory evidence that
their heart is in their work.
Lieutenant Austin, regimental quarter
master, pnid the armory a short visit on
Thursday !ast und gave the pleasant in
formation that the clothing so long prom
ised was on its way to the company quar
ter-master's htoreroom.
Second Brigade.
Charles J. Evans, major and signal offi
cer, Second Brigade, reports on the sub
ject of target practice:
"As a means of encouraging target prac
tice I would suggest that the prohibition
against Sunday practice be removed.
There are many men in the guard, particu
larly in those companies located in large
cities, who are unable to get away from
business on week days, and the prohibi
tion against Sunday ehooting certainly
operates to discourage them. The day of
shooting should be left to the company
commander, tinder the present system
of shooting for State medals the order re
quiring men to quamy at each practice in
a certain class is a harsh one."
Lieutenant L. Barrere, inspector of rifle
practice First Infantry, Second Brigade,
reports:
"I wish to report that the kind of am
munition used- in the preliminary rifle
practice of the First Infantry this year
was principally the 13. S. C. Co.'s 45-70,
which was furnished by the State. Some
of the men fired reloaded cartridges, fur
nished by themselves.
"The quality of the reloaded ammunition
was goou and those who used it obtained
good results, but that furnished by the
State was inferior and caused much un
certainty and dissatisfaction to those who
used it. The reason is evident from the
fact that the reloaded cartridges were pre
pared with care, the powder being of good
quality and bullets well lubricated pre
venting the foul ng and leading of rifles,
while that furnished by the State was ot
an uncertain qualify, as the powder in
many of the shells was in very poor con
dition, being a mixture which failing to
ignite simultaneously reduced the force of
the bullet, causing it to drop more or less,
sometimes missing the target entirely.
The results with snch irregular ammuni
tion are discouraging to u:en who have
practiced with carefully loaded cartridges.
"I do :iot know the cot ot the ammuni
tion wh :h is furnished by the State, but
wouM auggept that the amonnt be divided
pro rata among the companies, with in
structions to captains to see thateac:i man
was provided with cartridges loaded under
the direction of the shooting committee.
That course would give general satisfaction
and encourage practice.
"The number of men in the regiment
who are entitled to shot is approximately
970, including the cadet company. The
number who qualified for 60 per cent was
162, for 80 per cent 61, for 90 perc--nts.
For decorations 413 men competed and
228 qualified. One reason for the poor at
tendance was because the competition was
ordered on a weekday. Another reason
was because of the order that each com
petitor must make the score necessary to
procure a barâ 6o, 80 or 90 per cent at each
semi-annual target practice.
"The enforcement of that order will
>">ve extremely discouraging to target
practice, and will deter many from prac
ticing for the second shoot, as they are
one point or more below the number re
quired, and as they realize that under
existing orders they cannot win a bar this
year will pay no more attention to prac
tice. 1 wo'.-.ld strongly urge that the
order be rescinded, for it discourages the
men whom we wish particularly to en
courage â the beginners. "
Lieutenant Barrere also recommends
that the semi-annual target practice be
held as in former years, on Sunday, for
the reason that a majority of the members
of the guard are young men who are com
pelled to earn their living and are em
ployed in positions from which it is not
always an easy matter to get a day off,
except perhaps at a loss of a day's pay,
which many can ill afford.
The bivouac of the Second Brigade Sig
nal to r us last Tuesday and Wednes
day was a great success. The men,
about thirty m number, left San Fran
cisco for Larkspur, Marin CotMity, by
the 6 o'clock boat and reached their
destination just before dark. Upon
their arrival supper was partaken of, after
which the corps marched to its camping
ground in a small canyon well protected
from the wind by high tree-covered hills.
A campfire was built and a guard estab
lished, after which tbe boys enjoyed
themselves in various ways until 10:30
o'clock, when taps was sounded by the
trumpeter and all turned in, or rather
rolled themselves in their blankets with
intent to sleep, and might have succeeded
but for certain irrepressible spirits who
escaped to one side of th*; canyon and who
seemed determined to prove that they
were not asleep and had no intention of
being so, and in this they were highly
I successful.
In the morning reveille was sounded,
| and before breakfast ammunition was dis
tributed to enable the men to engage in
revolver practice. After oreaÃiast the
corps was divided into signal stations and.
distributed on the surrounding hills. Then
for nearly three hours messages were
flushed by t'.e heliograph and waved by
fiag^, the members of the corps displaying
remarkable proficiency in tueir work by
the rapidity with which the messages were
sent and received.
After lunch the boys occupied their time
in swimming, boating and revolver prac
tice, and late in the afternoon broke camp.
Tney boarded the last train and returned
to the city well pleased with the outing,
and without damage beyond a few wasp
stings. Major Evans, who accompanied
the corps, took a great deal of interest in
the work.
In the First Infantry Regiment there is
talk of a rifle-shooting match with marks
men of the Hawaiian National Guard.
Colonel Fairbanks, Fifth Infantry Reci
ment, will so 'n e=tabhsh regimental bead
quarters in San Francisco.
Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 10.âMili
tary activity among the members of this
section of tne Third Brigade is in abey
ance on the State Fair, and little if any
drilling is being done as so majiy of the
members are employed in stores which
keep open on fair week.
Company G, Second Infantry, is making
preparations to go to Placerville shortly
after the fair for a two-days camp and out
door dnll. The company will go by train
with full camp eqnipag?.
Company E is also looking forward to a
short outing, but as yet has formed no
definite plans. Sereeant McCarthy, who
is so deservedly popular among the rank
and file, having removed to i>atrobe will be
unable to attend drills in the future with
his accustomed regularity and will be
greatly missed by the members of his
company.
T.e Signal Corps estab'ished a station
out on the Stockton road last Sunday and
obtained good success in heliograph ser
vice. It is the intention of signalmen
to attempt communication with Cascade,
a railroad station on the summit of the
Sierras, as soon as the air clears suffici
ently, the distance being 100 miles. If
they succeed they will hold the distance
record of the State. The uovj are am
bitioiis and are working hard in all that
pertains to their branch of the service.
Governor Budd and staff will attend in
fuli uniform at State Fair day, which oc
curs the 17th.
Major Rice of the regular army, who is
inspecting officer of the Third Brigade, is
in the City, and states that he finds the
brl.ade in excellent shape and rapidly
coming into form. When asked for hi.s
opinion as to how the Third compares
with other brigades he said : "I am not in
a position to state as I have never in
spected the others, but I will say that
although the Third is ranked third in
efficiency I think the others must most
assuredly be in a good state to surpass the j
Third. Especially must this be true in
the Signal Com, as I find the members of â¢
tne Third Signal Corps to be men of ex- :
ceptional ability, bright, brainy and am
bitions, men who in the near future will
make the members of other signal corps
look well to their laurel?."
One of the most crying needs of the
National Guard is the lack of suitable
armories. This is a matter that should
be bnm.-ht to ttie attention of the next
Legislature and appropriations made for
their erection. In the East the armories
are fully up to the requirements of the
service and the service is correspondingly
benefited. Many of the Eastern brigades
compare favorably with the men of the
reguiar service in efficiency and arc avail
able for any service required of them.
Ihe success attained by Troop B during
its last forced march was sucli that an
other trip is in contemplation. This time
they will probably make a raid in the di
rection of Gait, some thirty miles distant.
VISALIA, Cal., Sept. 13.â Increased
interest is being manifested in the
drills and on the target range. Captain
F. W. Ward is determined that his com
pany shall be second to none in the guard.
He has issued an order which contains a
strong appeal to the members to exert
tnemselves in becoming proficient both in
tactics and on the range. The system of
work laid ou for the next three" months
will show marked improvement in the
company's efficiency.
Tuesday evening was the time appointed
for the drill contest for the handsome gold
medal prebented to the company by Ma
jor C. J. Berry (retired). The major was
formerly a high private in the company
and when he was appointed on General
Muller's staff he gave the company the
medal, to be contested for in a monthly
drill. Sergeant F. W. Mixter was the
lucky man to win t:>is month, after a con
tinuous hard drill for nearly two hours.
He was closely pressed by a large number
of the company, who all went down at a
technical command to kneel, leaving Ser
geant Mixter alone on the floor. A^large
number of visitors were prescutand highly
complimented the company on the excel
lence of the drill. Lieutenant Kibler
drilled the company. Tlie judges were
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1896.
Captain Ward, Lieutenant Dozier and
Lieutenant Adams.
Captain Ward has secured for a term of
years a splendid new target range 550
yards long by 50 yards wide within one
mile of the armory. The ranee runs
north and south and is covered with ereen
grass the whole year. Back of the bulk
heads is an extensive body of heavy oak
timber, making it one of the prettiest as
well as one of the finest ranges in tbe
State. The bulkheads are built at 200,
300 and 500 yards, and are so arranged
that a shot cannot possibly go astray.
Sliding taigets, electrc bells and other
conveniences have been put in. A neat
firing stand has been erected with raised
scorestand. Tbe men are practicing
faithfully, with the determination to make
fine scores at the semi-annual shoot,
which takes place this month. The best
scores made last Sunday were: Captain
Ward 45, Ed P. Myers 43, R. H. Renick
43, F. A. Thomas 43, 0. P. Byra 43, A. B.
Shippey 42, Lieutenant Kibler 42, C. C.
Lofland 42, F. W. Mixter 42, W. H. Ed
wards 41, P. M. Norboe 41, C. F. Hafley 40.
Several other good scores were made, not
reaching the forty mark.
Company H of the Sixth.
MERCED, Cal., Sept 11.â Company H,
Sixth Infantry, paraded in Stockton Sep
tember 9 with companies A, B and D of
the same regiment. The company left
here at 6 :30 a. m. over the Southern Pacific
via Lathrop. The train was late in arriv
ing in Stockton and the parade was about
ready to start, but Captain Graham
marched the company to breakfast first.
The parade was a very long one, and for
tbe military boys it was extremely tire
some, for it was very difficult to keep good
lines marching over the streets paved with
blocks. The Merced soldiers are drilled
on unpaved streets and not accustomed to
marchinu on stone blocks. No arrange
ments had been made for giviner the sol
diers water along tbe line of march, which
added to the discomfort of the occasion.
While the parade was trying the boys
stood it manfully and did their best to
make up for it by enjoying themselves to
the uttermost after it was over. The
troops turned out in the full dress uniform
formerly worn in this State. Company H
has never had these uniforms issued to
them, but companies C and F of Fresno
kindly loaned theirs for the occasion.
Lieutenant Smith, who has been in San
Francisco on a visit, joined the company
in Stockton and returned home with it on
Thursday evening.
Musician Swan and Private Dix, who
have been on an outing in the mountains,
returned in time for the celebration.
The company has received a consign
ment of the new regulation fatigue caps
and have relegated the old pattern to the
darkest corner of the quartermaster's
storerooms. The new caps are much ap
preciated by the boys for their comfort and
neatness of appearance.

Expected Visit of General Miles
Awakens Interest at tbe
Presidio.
The expected visit of General Miles,
commanding the Army, is now the chief
topic of comment in military circles. The
general, according to the announced pro
gramme, will leave Washington, D. C,
October 8. The post of Fort Sheridan,
Chicago, will be first visited. Then atten
tion will be given to the posts in Montana
and the Dakota*. On Puget Sound, where
vast fortifications have been planned,
some time will be passed.
General Forsyth, commanding the De
partment of California, is now in the East
on leave of absence and may not be in
San Francisco when the commanding
general arrives. It is quite well under
stood in army circles that General Miles
and General Forsyth do not give each
other the "glad hand" or the "gladsome
smile" when they meet, but it is regarded
as the next thing to high treason for army
officers to discuss the coolness in the pres
ence of newspaper scribes. Nevertheless,
for the peace of our fair country, it might
be iust as well for General Miles to come
before General Forsyth returns or for
General Forsyth to remain away until
General Miles co ncludes his visit in Cali
fornia.
The Eastern army journals ascribe great
importance to Lime Point station, and pre
dict that General Miles will place a body
of troops there. There is one twelve-inch
modern breech-loading rifle at Lime Point
and emplacements have been designated
for others. In the great system of harbor
defense the Lime Point position is im
portant The guns there will command a
fine sweep of the ocean and be able to de
liver a plunging fire on the narrow chan
nel which separates Lime Point from Fort
Point.
The twelve-inch rifle now in place at
Lime Point is guarded by a single watch
man. In the event of hostilities with
Great Britain another watchman micht be
required there to keep an eye on the Brit
ish colony at San Rafael.
The foot batteries of the Fifth Artillery,
stationed at the Presidio, are now having
annual tareel practice with the new
United States rifle, commonly known as
the Krag-Jorgensen. Lieutenant Mileyis
the range officer. The practice Degan last
Tuesday and will continue until each man
has fired thirty-five shots. The shortest
ranee is 100 and the longest 300 yards.
I Some excellent work has been done.
The board of officers appointed with the
I approval of the major-eeneral command
ing the army by the regimental com
mander to conduct the battery competi
tions of tne Fifth Artillery consists of:
First Lieutenant Warren P. Newcomb.
Second Lieutenant George G. Gatley.
Second Lieutenant Conway H. Arnold
Jr.
The officers comprisine the board left
for Fort Canby last Tuesday. They
should return in time to begin their du
ties at the Presidio September 17.
Lieutenant Treat, Fifth Artillery, has
gone to Fort Riley. Kan., to become Adju
tant of the Light Artillery Battalion.
There will be quite a concentration of
troopj at Riley, early in October. When
General Miles arrives there to view the I
maneuvers there will be on the field
eleven troopa of cavalry, three light bat
teries and five companies of infantry.
The infantry will march from Fort Leav
enworth to Riley.
Colonel Shatter, First United States In
fantry, who is temporarily commanding
the Department of California, is now oc
cupying the army mansion at Black Point.
The occupancy of the premises is for the
benefit of his wife's health.
It is now the talk at the Presidio that
Major Tully McCrea will not be ordered to
appear hetore the retiring board. Major
McCrea has a gallant record for service in
battle and bis slight disabilities were |
caused by wounds in action. The depart- I
ment, it is said, ruled that an olficer should
not be retired for disability so incurred,
unless the disability rendered him physi
cally unable to perform service.

WHY SWEENEY WAS
TOSSED ABOUT
There Was No Room for
Him in the Receiving
Hospital.
PADDED CELLS ALL FULL
Where the Surgeon in Charge
and the Police Dif
fered Widely.
DR. F. T. FITZGIBBON EXPLAINS.
Yet Chief Crowley Insists That Only
Accused Persons Can Be
Imprisoned.
The case of Mike Sweeney, the old man
who was refused a place in the City Re
ceiving Hospital Friday morning, is now
quoted by Dr. Frank T. Fitzgibbon, the
surgeon in charge at that time, as an ex
ample of the inadequate accommodations
and general neglect of tbe hospital by tbe
Supervisors.
Sweeney's gtory was told exclusively in
The Call yesterday. He was taken from
Market a::d Goutzb streets in the police
patrol wagon to the Receiving Hospital lor
medical treatment, was at first relused ad
mission and subsequently allowed to go
outside. He was refused admittance to
the ward, and the police then moved him
to the City and County Hospital, where he
still remains on the sick list.
Ti e Receiving Hospital record shows
that Sweeney was received at 7 a. m. Fri
day, treated for "alcoholism" and sent to
the City prison. Assistant Police Sur
geon Fitzgibbon said yesterday: "I saw
this man when he came in here. He was
not suffering from the efiects of gas inha
lation, for he was walking about. The po
liceman said that Sweeney had been sleep
ing in a saloon all night. The three
padded cells were filled with insane people,
and the inebriate cells were crowded also.
So there was no place to put Sweenpy.
"He was suffering from delirium tremens,
and we could r.ot put him in a ward with
surgical patients or others suffering from
poison, all of whom need quiet and rest.
"Tbe police refused to take Sweeney
back; he was not so sickly that he could
not be kept in the City Prison a little
while till he would be sent to the City and
County Hospital. The man remained
here for some time, and went outside for
fresh air and took a seat on a window-sill
opposite the door.
"This is not the first time a case of this
kind lias come here. The police are always
throwing patients on us ; they use our am
bulance for old drunks with cut heads,
but when there is a sick man they put him
into the patrol-wajron and shake him up.
They come here with drunks, raving ma
niacs, and put them in a chair and then

Gty Hall While Suffering.
walk away. We cannot take them all.
This is no place for cases of delirium tre
mens.
"The Supervisors recently appropriated
money for the enlargement of the hospi
tal. We were to have had new padded
cells ana new rooms for inebriates, but we
got nothing â nothing at all. I understand
they are going to start in on the improve
ments right away."
Chief of Police Crowley stated that as
there was no criminal charge against
Sweeney the police could not lock him up
in the City Prison. He had not investi
gateu the case, but on asking for a report
from the prison-Keeper he was informed
that Sweeney was taken to the Receiving
Hospital for medical treatment, refined
admission there and returned. Finally
Police Captain Healy had Sweeney re
moved to the City and County Hospital.
Serjeant Houghtaling declared that
Sweeney was not drunk, but appeared to
be very sick. He made practically the
same statement as Sergeant IHdwell,
which appeared in The Cam,. Sweeney
was seen in ward J at the County Hus
pital yesterday. He was nervous and
weak. "I had been up late Thursday
night, and when I woke early Friday
morning I discovered that gas was escap
ing in my room. I cot out as well as I
couid and went to the saloon downstairs,
but then I was stupid and until I got to
the Receiving Hospital was unconscious,
or at least everything was a blank to me.
I was not drunk, for all I took Thursday
night was four glasses of beer. I had no
money to buy liquor, haying been out of
employment for a lons time."
Dr. Kusel, in charge of ward J, said that
Sweeney had been put to bed in the ward.
His patient was quiet and the doctor felt
sure that there was no need of placing
him tinder restraint. "There was noth
ing to indicate alcoholism," added the
doctor. "Dr. Hutibell exiimined him and
did not see any such indications. There
certainly was no delirium tremens; I'll
swear to that. Sweeney was not even
eiven a sedative, but k dose of calomel, and
put to bed, where he slept for hours
quietly. He has been here three days and
remained absolutely quiet all the time.
There was certainly no cause for fear that
he might do any harm. Sweeney was
simply very sick and run down. He com
plained of a headache and indigestion,
but he was not a patient that should be
restrained."
The worst feature of Sweeney's case
seems to be that he got "between the devil
and the deep sea" at the City Hall, where
peace may reign again â after those new
padded cells are opened in the Receiving
Hospital.
THOUGHT PHOTOGRAPHY
Rev. Mr. Copeland Says It Is One of
the Possibilities of the
Century.
At the meeting of the Theosophical So
ciety in Golden Gate Hall last evening the
principal address was by Rev. W. E. Cope
land on the X-ray. He entered into a
lengthy explanation of the omnipotence
of ether, which he declared is the moving
lorce of the universe.
He then spoke of an article by Professor
lÂ»avid Starr Jordan on the subject of
thought and tbe photociai.hing of it. and
said that be bad some doubt in regard to
what the professor bad set iorth, that the
photographing of thought had actually
occurred, but he had no doubt that before
the end of the century such a thing would
be possible. "For," said he, "I believe that
thought can be photographed through the
same force that enables one person to hyp
notize another, and that force is the one I
have already mentioned."
TWO ABLE DISCOURSES.
Seinlonof Ihe Spiritualists' Association
at Golden Gate Hall Yesterday.
The State Spiritualists' Association met
at Golden Gate Hail yesterday morning.
Service was opened by congregational
singing, after which Rev. H. P. Haworth
delivered the invocation.
President Thomas followed with his ad
dress on the subject of "Truth," and its
bearing â as exemplified and evidenced by
mediuniistic phenomena â upon spiritual
philosophy and the condition of the fu
ture life.
"We are standing to-day," said the lec
turer, "where we can see the tide of truth
advancing. That truth has always been
the same, bat we ourselves are becoming
better able to understand it than for
merly." Discussing the much-vexed ques
tion of "What good will it do to believe in
spiritualism?" the speaker observed:
"The good that will accrue from a
Knowledge of a philosophy that takes
away the fear of death and proves the
continuance of life for allâ a life of pro
gressive advancement â must have im
portant bearinzs upon the happiness and
betterment of our lives here, and, conse
quently, hereafter."
Mis. Jennie Robinson communicated
messages from tbe spirit side of life and
National President Barrett closed the
morning services with an appropriate
poem.
At 2 p. M. Rev. H. P. Haworth delivered
the address of tbe afternoon, his subject
being, "The Power of Mind." In this he
ascribed the trouble in the world to-day
to tbe fact that men do not devote their
mental faculties to the object of extract
ing all the possible good out of life.
"The world," he said, "will stand aside
for the man who knows where he is going
and what he is going to do, and we can all
i be successful if we will only emulate this
spirit." He cited the experience of Bibli
cal and modern times to illustrate the
operation or the latter. The same power,
he aspurrd his hearers, that leu Moses and
the children of Israel, was leading us to
day. He appealed earnestly, in con
clusion, for a higher popular conception
of mind.
There was another large attendance at
the evening session, in the course of which
Rev. Mr. haworth and Mr. Barrett deliver-
Ed impressive addresses, the latter stating
that he had been appointed by the Board
nt the Stato Association to ordain Thomas
G. Newman as a minister of the gospel of
spiritualism.
Meetings will be continued at Golden
Gate Hail on Monday and Tuesday even
ings, and at tins Hamilton Hall, Oakland,
on Wednesday afternoon and evening.

REV. BISON'S INVESTIGATIONS
Depletion of the Male Population and
tÂ»Â»e Sunday-School Attendance.
At the Howard-street Methodist Church
yesterdny the Rev. D. Birch preached to
a large congregation. He said:
"In visiting the Sabbath-schools of Cali
fornia I have been much struck by the
vast Tiumh^r of girls as compared with
biys. In some the proportion is 90 per
cent :irls to 10 p n r cent boys. There are
causes tor tnis condition dr things. It is
not only that boys are more difficult to
win, but perhaps because while little chiU.
dren they die off more rapidly. lam told
that during two months ot this year a cer
tain City undertaker burieJ the bodies of
twenty-six boys under 5 years of age, but
no girls un ?er that age. Seven years ago
the proportion was 34 per cent more dovs
than snrls under 6 yea's of aare, but last
year 85 per cent more male than lema!e
infants died. If this be true, it should be
the determined effort of our health and
medical boards to discover the reason and
sueirest a remedy. I have, however, been
greatly delighted with the appearance of
the children attending the Sabbath
schools, and comparing then; with chil
dren playing in the streets it is obvious
that thf scholars have purer, brighter
eyes and finer, sweeter voices. I hope be
fore long every healthy child may be in
duced to attend some Sunday-school to
learn to rightly reverence self and culti
vate the ?pirit of acting justly to our fel
low-creatures."

vestigating tbe law of the case. In
the meantime thÂ« Southern Pacific
Company, well pleased with the conduct
of its servants in the State Board of Eqaalt
ization, is preserving a discreet silence ana
closely watching the turn of events, on the
alert to take advantage of any legal tech
nicality which may arise out of the con
troversy.
The 20 per cent increase in the assess
ment of this City will, it in claimed, re
duce the State rate of taxation. The rail
roads (the Southern Pacific and Central
Pacific) were assessed by the State Board
of Equalization before the rate was fixed
and before the assessment was increased
and their assessments were thus naturally
and materially decreased. The assess
ment of the Southern Pacific and the
Central Pacific for this year has been
fixed at $36,000,000. Were it not for the
increased assessment of San Francisco and
some othejj counties the State tax rate
would b-- about 45 cents on the $100 â but
by increasing the assessments of these
counties the State Board of Equalization
has been enabled to reduce the tax rate to
42 cents on the $109. At 45 cents the rail
road companies mentioned would be com
pelled to pay 3 cents more on the $100
than they will be required to cio now,
since the rate has been lixed at 42 cents.
"It seems very strange," said a promi
nent real estate expert, "that the State
Board of Equalization should increase the
assessment of San Francisco 20 per cent
this year when the Assessor has added
$30,000,000 to the roll, and yet not have
deemed it ueccssary to make any increase
in the assessment last year. There is a
joker in it somewhere surely, and I think
The Call is correct in saying that it is the
Southern Pacific Company. So far as San
Francisco is concerned, we may console
ourselves with the thought that with a
high assessment we can make a corre
spondingly low tax rate, and so equalize
things.
"Last year the State and City taxes to
gether amounted to $2 25, but this year I
don't think they will exceed $1 35, so there
is another grain of comfort for us."
"Ca-h and solvent credits," said Hugo
Herzer, the Assessor's chief deputy, "can
not be raised, and consequently are not
affected by our increased assessment. The
20 per cent increase also affects mortgages
not assessed up to their face value, where
the property in question is assessed for
less than the face value of the mortgage.
"The total value of all mortgages in San
Francisco this year is about $50,000,000.
Probably not more than one-fifth of the
mortgages will be raised 20 per cent."

ET.KCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1898.
To-day Maine speaks.
The Arkansas vote is now a back nulli
ty r.
Maine will see Vermont's majority and
go it several thousand better.
Every workshop is a Republican headÂ«
quarters in these days, for the workers
need protection.
The silver-mine owners who have backed
Bryan have made a mighty poor gamble
lor their money.
Next to the speeches of McKinley the
best Republican campaign documenta are
the speeches of Bryan.
We shall know when the Maine vote is
counted just how much Sewall'3 nomina
tion is worth to Democracy.
The battle for protection is virtually
won, but the people should be careful not
to elect any iree-traders to otiice.
In the mad whirl of his oratory in these
Says it is doubtful if Bryan ever takes
time even to think that he thinks.
The trouble in the fusion camp is that
every fusionist wishes to get tho 1G and
give the other fellow the measly 1.
We have now been informed that Claude
Matthews is sick and Boies is tired out,
but what about Silver Dick Bland?
The American workingman who wishes
good wages and good dollars is not taking
much stock in the Bryan movement.
Level-headed Democrats have given up
this campaign and are trying to console
themselves with the hope of better luck in
11KX).
It is safe to say that when Tom Watson
reads the report from Maine to-morrow he
will conclude that he has a good one on
BewalL
It is certainly unnecessary for Bryan to
discuss tbe tariff since everybody knows
he voted for the Wilson bill and his record
is enough.
The free silverites will make a hard
light to cut down the Kepublicau majority
in Maine to-day, but they will find the
job even harder than the light.
The Democratic orators talk of money,
money, money, but the people know the
only way to get money i 3 to get work, and
work is hard to get under Democratic free
trade.
Before long the Indianapolis nominees
will be notified, and they will then have a
chance to write letters of acceptance which
will cause them to be remembered for one
day more.
Our readers are doubtless getting tired
of the reiteration of Bryan's speeches, but
we must keep publishing them, for we
wish to increase the Republican vote as
much as possible.
To well-informed advocates of free silver
coinage international agreement seems
not only the safest but the shortest way 10
establish bimetallism, and therefore they
support McKinley.
If ever there was a political forlorn hope
it is that of the Palmer and Buckner
Democrats, but nevertheless there are a
good many right-thinking Americans who
glory in their pluck.
It is reported in Chicago that Governor
Altgeld did not make his trip toGlenwood
Springs, Colo., for health only, but to
strike the silver-mine owners for a cam
paign fund, and it ia the belief in Chicago
that lie got it.
Republicans must be on their guard in
Congressional and Legislative districts.
It is the evident intention of the Popocrats
to abandon Bryan and make every effort
to elect Congressmen ana the United
States Senator.
Workingmen might as well quit asking
democratic orators and newspapers how
they will get any profit from free silver
while American mills are closed, for they
will never get a satisfactory answer no
matter how often they ask.
Farmers have learned by their experi
ence with the Democratic tariff that they
need a home market for their products
more than they need free silver, and ac
cordingly they are not going to vote for
Bryan the free-trader, no matter what he
may promise about money.
According to Moses Handy the attempt
to raise & fund to start a free-sftver news
paper in Chicago had to be "abandoned
several hundred thousand dollars short of
the mark, so it seems the silver boys are
not bleeding half as much as they arc
yelling.
A GREAT DAY AT CANTON.
Five thousand men, Republicans and
Democrats, called upon Major McKinley
last Saturday to assure him that the peo
ple are still for good money and prosper
ity, the active working of jawsmiths in
the direction of ruin notwithstanding. In
the course of his speech to some 700 Penn
sylvania workingmen, Major McKinley
said:
"1 do not think there was ever a time
in the history of our country when so
many men were interested ia the rightful
settlement of public questions as this year,
andno class of our people are so much in
terested in their rightful settlement as the
men who work lor wages and salary."
Mr. Bryan is on record in a dozen places
as being opposed to the Government af
fording any protection whatever to Ameri
can workingmen against the competition
of pauper and other kinds of low wage
schedules of Europe and the Orient, and
he is Irying 10 organize a following that
will enable him to put his free trade
in labor's product theories into practical
operation. Major McKinley is right.
There never was a time in the history of
the country when sso many men were in
terested In the issues ai those now before
them, especially are men who work for
wages interested, for if Bryan ism prevails
they know that they will be brought face
to face with the W3ges of other countries
and that they will be defeated.
No doubt tbe question which the Bryan
ites have thrust upon the country ne
cessitate an unusually deep inter
est in public affairs on the part
of the people. Mr. Bryan is trav
eling through the country soliciting
votes for himself for President. He is ad
vocating the adoption of a system of gov
ernment which means the overthrow of
traditions and economic principles which
have obtained ever since the Nation was
founded, and tbe question which tbe peo
ple have to answer is, Shall we experi
ment with other forms of government, or
shall we hold on to the basic principles of
the federation of the States which have
enabled the country to grow from a few
colonies to the most powerful Nation in
the world?
But there is equally as much danger to
the people in Bryan's monetary theories
as in his free-trade doctrine. It matters
not if he does talk of bimetallism, what
he is aiming at is to put this country
wholly upon a silver basis. Ilia theory
could lead to no other result. He denies
the right of those to whom our farmers
and manufacturers sell their products to
have a voice in determining what kind of
money shall be employed in our trade in
tercourse with them. This is a proposi
tion which should, as Major McKin
ley says, interest our people deeply.
It surely connot be that those
who work for wages and those
who buy and sell in the markets are will
ing to substitute a doubtful and ever
changine monetary system for the one we
have now, which firmly and without vari
ableness holds every form of our dollar
up to the equivalent of 100 cents, and not
only in the United States but in every
country where money is used. There is
no doubt at all that the people have great
interest in the issue now before them, for
the prosperity of the country and the

basic principles of the Government and
build anew, while Major McKinley would
repair the waste places and revive busi
ness on the lines of protection and sound
money.

A TRUE DOCTRINE.
In his speech accepting the nomination
of the National Democratic party for
Vice-president, General Buckner said:
"Wages are fixed by a law that is as im
mutable as the season*. Wages depend
ou production, and nothing else. An in
fallible test of prosperity is the rate of
wages paid to labor, and I will support
any man who will raise the rate of wages,
no matter by what political name. I be
lieve in high wages, because they mean
general prosperity."
What General Buckner said has been a
doctrine of the Republican party from the
beginning, but the Republican party did
not discover the principle underlying the
declaration. It is as old as humanity.
The law which General Buckner says is
immutable is the law of supply and de
mand, with something added. There
might be demand enough to consume the
entire supply of labor ana the price of
labor might still be unreasonably low.
Were it not so there would be no occasion
for labor organizations. To be just the
demand should amply compensate the
supply, and labor unions seek to have that
done.
But the demand is under the law of
competition, and if the cost of its product
is higher than the similar product of an
other demand it is shutout of the market.
It cannot reduce the cost of its raw ma
terial to meet competition, therefore it is
at a disadvantage which it cannot over
come so far as that item is concerned. It
may, however, compete in the markets
for finished product by lowering the price
of labor to where no competitor would
have the advantage in the matter of total
cost of the articles marketed. Iv that
event the demand for labor would be equal
to the supply, but the supply would not
have just compensation, nor would pros
perity be general even thougn the pro
ducer's final profits should be as great as
il he paid labor twice as much.
General Buckner understands the work
ing of the law of demand and supply ex
actly as Major McKinley does. That is to
say, the demand for labor should be so
circumstanced that it may be able not
only to take the entire supply, but give
it such compensation as Â«hall enable it to
have a reasonable margin of difference be
tween what it costs for its proper main
tenance and what it receives for its service.
This difference is what labor puts into a
home and in the savings bank. It so Hap
pens that under our system of govern
ment the standard of living for labor is
necessarily very much higher than in any
other country. Moreover, a peculiarity of
our system of government is that labor, as
an individual, is a sovereign, clothed with
as much authority and entitled to as
many rights under the law as the demand
for labor who gives labor employment,
hence the demand has no right to ask for
exclusive privileges. If the law secures
good to it labor Las the right to partici
pate in whatever good accrues.
But the question is. to what extent shall
the law secure good results to demand and
supply, they being sovereigns upon an
equal footing? The ultimate purpose of
the Government being to secure the lar

gest possible degree of comfort, prosperity
and safety to its people, it follows that it
must protect its people against foreign
competition that would impoverish them
quite as much as against foreign invasion
that contemplated the acquisition of any
part or all of tbe country.
This is the law of self-preservation nnd
to abrogate it would be to annul tbe law
of demand and supply, so far as our own
people are concerned, for tha material
strength of this country must necessarily
come from conditions which enable us to
not only create a demand ourselves but
to supply the demand ourselves. This is
what General Bucfcner means. It is what
Major McKinley advocates everyday. It
is what the Republican party has always
contended for, and it is nothing more nor
less than doing business on a business
sense basis. Mr. Bryan is not in favor of
anything of this kind, but Mr. Bryan is
not a true American in very many ways.
Whenever a nation has debased its cur
rency in ancient or modern history the man
vho has suffered the worst has not been the
man who lends money, but the mon vho has
to earn it. We luive tried the experiment our
selves. When we suspended specie payments
during the Civil War the price of goods went
up enormously, but the wages of labor lagged
behind. It is a matter of official record that
a week's wages in JSOS bought less than they
did in ISGO.âHon. Curtis Guild of New York.
COMMERCIAL TRAVELERS AND
McKINLEY.
Commercial travelers are the jolliest
men in the world, but they never forget
that they are "on the road" to sell goods.
They are, too, the best readers of the signs
of the times and are in the best possible
position to keep a finger on the pulse of
public sentiment. It is safe to conclude,
therefore, that when so very many of
them go out of their way to call upon
Major McKinley and assure him that his
theories of government in practical opera
tion are necessary to the trade and traffic
of the country, there i 3 reason for their
going.
In his business life the commercial trav
eler is all things to all men. It is his
business to know people, ana from people
he gathers information that is valuable to
him, which he utilizes for the good of his
line or trade. If, then, he is espousing
the cause of Major McKinley, it is because
he sees that his customers believe that
McKinley's election would give stability
to their business enterprises and increase
the volume of their trade. As a business
proposition the commercial traveler wants
done whatever will honorably enable him
to sell more goods, and hence if his cus
tomers demand the election of McKinley
because they believe it to be to theii* inter
est", he is for McKinley.
But aside from all that, the commercial
traveler is the manliest of men and a
sincere lover of his country's institutions,
and no one better than he knows what in
a commercial way is best for the country.
He is never a partisan politician, and hence
it follows that in advocating the election
of Major McKinley he is doing it as a busi
ness matter, and sincerely believes that
protection anu the other economic declar
ations which Major McKinley is pledged
to apply in the conduct of the affairs of
the country would be of sreater advantage
to commerce than those which Bryan ad
vocates.
It is contended by the advocates of free sil
ver that this it an issue between the gold
standard and bimetallism. Nothing could
be farther from the truth. It is an issue be
tween a monetary system which tin give us
silver atone and the existing - monetary sys
tem, which gives us a practical bimetallism. â
Senator Thurston.
WEBSTER ON BRYANISM.
Lost Saturday night the local Democracy
held a mass-meeting to give expression to
political sentiments which proved to be as
thoroughly un-American in tone and
character as could be expressed in lan
guage. The warp and woof of the speeches
were composed of expressions like these:
'â¢Will you settle this matter by the ballot
or by the sword?" "When the physical
strength of the classes is brought against
the physical strength of the masses the
former will be crushed like eggshells."
"As in July, 1776, the American people
adopted a document petting them free
from the yokes and chains of slavery that
they had borne hitherto, so in JuJy of 1896
the American people had placed before
them a new Declaration of Independence,
setting them free from yokes and chains
just as galling." "While the War of In
dependence brought upon our ancestors
their Saratoga, their Camden and the
pangs of starw lion and of unshod bleed
ing feet, in the end it brought to them
their Yorktown. So it may be in this new
war."
No better reply to these and all such
revolutionary utterances could be found
than the following irom a speech of Daniel
Webster, delivered in January, 1834, at a
time when the money question was dis
torted and twisted by demagogues just as
it is to-day for personal political ad
vantage. The great commoner said:
Mr. President: On the great questions which
occupy us we all look for some decisive, move
ment of public opinion. As I wish that move
ment to be free, intelligent and unbiased, the
true manifestation of the public will, I desire
to prepare the country for another appeal,
which 1 pe rceive Is about to be made to popular
prejudice â another attempt to obscure all dis
tinct views ol the popular good by loud cries
against false danger, and by exciting the
passions of one class against another. lam
not mistaken in the omen. I see the magazine
whence the weapons of this warfare are to be
drawn. I already hear the din of the ham
mering ol the arms preparatory to the combat.
There may be such arms, perhaps, as reason
able justice ana honest patriotism cannot
resist. Kvery effort at resistance, it is possible,
way be feeble and powerless; but I for one
shall make an effort to betcin now, and to be
carried on and continued with uutiriag xeal
till the end of the contest comes.
Sir, I see in those vehicles which carry to the
people sentiments from high places, plain dec
larations that the present controversy is but a
strife between one part of a community and
another. I hear it boasted as the unfailing se
curity, the solid ground, never to be shaken,
on which recent measures rest, that the poor
naturally hate the rich. I know that, under
the cover of the roofs of the Capitol, withiu
the last tweuty-four hours, among men sent
her* to devise means for the public safety and
the public good, it Has been vaunted forth, as
matter of boast and triumph, that one cause
existed powerful enough tosupporteverything,
and that was the natural hatred of the poor to
the rich.
Sir, I pronounce the author of such senti
ments to be guilty of attempting a detestable
fraud on the community ; a double fraud, a
fraud which Is to cheat men out of their prop
erty and the earnings of their labor, by first
cheating them out of their understanding.
"The natural hatred of the poor to the rich!"
Sir, it shall not Le to the last moment of my
existenceâ it shall be only when lam drawn to
the vergo of oblivion, when I shall cease to
have respect or affection for anything on earth
âthat 1 will believe the people of the United
States effectually deluded, cajoled and driven
about in herds by such abominable frauds as
this. If tiiey shall sink to that point, if they
so far cease to be men, thinking men, intelli
gent men, as to yield to such pretenses and
such clamor they will be slaves already, slaves
to their passions, slaves to the fraud and
knavery ol pretended friends; they will de
serve to bÂ« blotted out of all the records of
freedom; they ought not to dishonor thÂ« c*uie
ot self-government by attempting any longer
to exercise it; they ought to keep their un
worthy hands entirely off the cause of repub- '
lican liberty, if they are capable of being the
victims of artifices so shallow, of tricks so
stale, so threadbare, bo often practiced, so
much worn out, on serfs and slaves.
"The natural hatred of the poor against the
rich!" "The danger of a moneyed aristoc
racy'" '-A power as great and dangerous as
that resisted by the revolution!" "A call to a
new Declaration of Independence!" Sir, I ad
monish the people against the object of out
cries like these. I admonish every industri
ous laborer in the country to be on his guard
against such delusion*. I tell him the attempt
is to play off his passions against his interests,
and to prevail on him, in the name of liberty,
to destroy ah the fruits of liberty ; in the name
of patriotism to injure and afflict his country,
and in the name of his own independence to
destroy that very independence and make
him a beggar and a slave. Has he a dollar?
He is advised to do that which will destroy
h>ill its value. Has he hands to labor? Let
him rather fold them and sit still than be
pushed on by fraud and artifice to support
measures which will render his labor useleÂ«Â»
and hopeless.
COAST EXCHANGES.
Frank A. Leach of the Oakland Evening
Enquirer has purchased the Oakland Morning
Times and if he succeeds in the publication of
the pair of them as well aa he has done with
the Enquirer he will have entitled himself to
be called the Napoleon of Oakland journalism.
Charles Burrey has disposed of his interest
in the Marin County Herald to JUpssrs. George
Bing and 8. D. Chatterton, who, in assuming
chargo of the paper, remark that they are
actuated by an honest desire to make Sausa
lito their home for the future; tnat they have
no ax to grind and will "treat rich and poor
alike with courtesy and respect so long as they
deserve it." Both of the new proprietors have
had experience in the newspaper field.
It is rather a good sign for a community and
rather a irood advertisement as well when its
local paper finds It necessary to enlarge in
order to accommodate its increasing business.
The iEtna (California) Reporter has just shown
this excelleut evidence of progress and pros
perity. Charles Calkins, its editor, Qeclares
that "the paper will continue to keep abreast
of the times and grow up with the age of en
terprise and progress which has now fully
dawned upon the new Scott Valley."
D. D. Bowman, who at different times was
connected with the Mountain View Register
and the Los Gatos Mail, has purchased the Tl I
lamook (Or.) Headlight.
It is a pleasure to note that George F. Weeks
has become sole proprietor of the Bakersfield
Californian, a paper which owes its high stand
ing and reputation to the aniole qualifications
of Mr. Weeks as a newspaper man of the all
round variety.
In pursuance of the divine injunction, "six
days shalt thou labor and do all thy work,"
the men who make xhe Stockton Dail v Record
will be given a day of rest on trie sabbath and
no paper will De issued from that office on
Monday mornings hereafter. As compensation
to the public for the one day of rest the Record
promises to be brighter and more newÂ«y on the
otber six day*.
The Stockton Independent will also become a
six-day paper, its publishers trusting that all
its hard-wonted artisans "will find their way
to some of the houses of worship to atone for
their past transgressions in laboring seven days
in the week for the past six months."
The town of Williams has lost a newspaper
and Arbuckle has gained one in the change of
base of the Transcript, published by J. L. Ken
nun and L. A. Eichler.
The Keystone, a new Populist newspaper pub
lished at Multermoro, near Fresno, has ma.de a
special ollor, wiUi the object of increasing its
subscription list. To everybody who brings in
Â¥- iv cash tor two yearly subscriptions it will
give a choice of riiv two of a number of prizes,
includiug one gallon wine, half gallon brandy,
two pounds plug tobacco, one box cigars and
one pair corsets. Bread, better and meat, or
any otjier kind of food, do not appear on the

San Benito County farmers now haul their
hay by team to the San Jose market. Says the
San Jose Hews: "The distance is forty-five
miles and the cost of hauling is if' 2 per ton,
which ou the amount of hay that will be
hauled before the rain sets in will mean the
paying of nearly $2000 to the teamsters, which
until last year went to the railroad company.
Last year tne firm of Bennett Bros, paid $3000
for hauling its hay by team. The railroad
rates are $1 per ton, but the question of time
and mode of shipping are not convenient for
the shippers."
Merced is enjoying quite a building boom at
present. According to the Star of that city:
"several new houses are being erected and
other buildings being altered or improved.
The brick work on the high school building is
finished and the carpenters and cornice-men
are now at work on their portion ot the struc
ture. Every effort is being made to hasten the
completion, in order that the building may be
occupied this winter. The Board of Supervis
ors have advertised for bids for fitting up the
scientific laboratory in the basement. Work
on the Valley road freight and passenger depot
is also being rapidly prosecuted. The founda
tions are completed and the superstructure
has been started."

Sonoma County is awakening to tho fact
that its hills are rich in treasures of gold, sil
ver, copper, quicksilver, coal, marble, etc. A
vein of manganese is supposed to lie near the
base of St. Helena Mountain, and its course is
said to have been traced by float for several
miles. A black sand ou the coast yields parti
cles of gold. It was worked some time ago at
the mouth of Bodega Bay with small success.
In the Santa Rosa Republican >?illiam M. Got
waldt has an article, iv the course of which he
â ays: "The mineral deposits of Sonoma
County, as evidenced by recent discoveries,
seem principally to lie along a line drawn
from English Hill to Occidental, thence north
erly to Cloverdale, and then deflecting to the
east at an auglo of 90 de?.
"Beginning at the lower extremity of the
line there is an extensive ledge of quartz, as
saying $4 in gold and 60 cents "in silver. Pros
pect shafts have been sunk on the ledge and
assays made Irom a number of places. Barren
rock bat never been found lying between its
walls. Johnson * Stillwell of Bloomfleld have
recently been doing considerable development
on the ledge, but have as yet treated none of
the ore. Around Occidental some excellent
float has been found lately.
"On Dutch Bill Hill, several miles from the
town, is located the Garibaldi gold mine,
which has been wonted for several years.
Three assays recently obtained from different
laboratories average $12 01 a ton. This indi
cates a rich strike, as the ledge is very exten
sive and has been crowing better as develop
ment work progressed. The ore body has been
tapped by a drift over 200 feet long and a
shaft sunic sixty feet deep at the face of the
tunnel. It is expected to have a stamp mill at
work before the end of the year. The prin
cipal stockholders in the mine are John Go
betti, Pedrini Bros., Gamella Bros, and Fran

''Less than a month ago a valuable cinnabar
deposit was unearthed within the village of
Occidental by James Brian, who was digging
a well on his property. The sulphate of quick
silver is embodied in a vein of quartz 30 feet
wide. The cinnabar shows in tiny red streaks,
and is supposed to comprise 2 per cent of the
ledge matter where it is richest. Notwith
standing the low price of quicksilver, the claim
looks like a paying property, at least worth
investigating.
"M. C. Meeker has cut many thousands of
dollars' worth of timber on his land, but he
believes that a greater fortune is concealed
beneath the redwood roots. There are im

wooded hillsides.
"Near Healdsburg the Madeira brothers
made a discovery a year ago which may result
in a huge bonanza. It consists of a mountain
of onyxized marble. Not only Is the supply
wonderful for its extent but for its superior
quality. There is only one drawback to the
development of the property, and that is tho
inaccessibility. If a road were built to the
quarry and a moneyed company owned the
property it would doubtless yield handsome
returns."
Yisalia and PorterviUe la Xulare County are
rejoicing over the completion of the Mount
Whitney telephone system. It is expected
that branch lines will coon be extended in all
directions. The Visalia Times thus refers to the
leading spirit of the enterprise: "Dr. J. M.
Gilstrap, president of the company, has, iv
the building of the line, shown his ability in
managing and pushing such a project to a suc
cessful conclusion. Better than all, he has
built seventy miles oi telephone wires, with
fixtures complete, without incurring but a few
dollars of debt, an achievement that was never
done before in California, and that was pro

his efficiency."
The sixteen-page Admission day edition of
thÂ« Stockton Mail was a creditable one in every
respect. The illustrations were many and
attractive, and besides the matter relative to
the celebration and the hiÃtory of the day
there were several pages of information con
cerning the wealth, resources and prospects
of the railroad center of the San Joaquin

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Steamer trials in the British navy have oi late
been conducted with a view of ascertaining
what avessel Is capable of doing in actual ser
vice. Thus the trials of the Venus, protected
eheathed cruiser of SGOO tons, which took
place last month, extended over ten days and
consisted of eight hours' continuous steaming
under natural draught, four hours under
forced draught and thirty hours' continuous
steaming at sea over a certain cour.se under
natural draught, half-boiler power, to ascer
tain the coal consumption. The contract
called for 8000-horsepower and 1814 knots
speed under natural draught, and the trial
gave 8204-horse power and 19J^ knots. Under
forced draught the power was 9774 and 20.18
knots speed. Under half-power the engines
developed 4876-horsepower and a speed of
10.8 knots, with a coal consumption of only
1.6 pounds per horsepower per hour.
Three serious accidents from lowness of
water in ihe boilers have recently been re
ported from the British fleet in the Mediter
ranean. In the Trafalgar and Phaeton no
casualties occurred, but on the Biake the
crown-sheet collapsed and one man was
scalded to death. It is said that the feed
pumps were not properly weighted and that
the water returned to the tanks instead of
gome into the boilers. It is also alleged that
young inexperienced engineers are blamed
for these very serious and costly accidents.
Forty-seven torpedo-boat destroyers are now
in course of construction for the British navy,
the admiralty having just placed orders for
twenty with light ship-building firms. All
these vessels are to have a speed of 30 knots.
The Santa Fe, one of tour torpedo-boat de
stroyers building by Yarrow & Co. for the
Argentine, has had her three-hours' trial, and
with a load of thirty-five tons made 26%
knots. These boats are 190 feet in length,
19 feet 6 inches beam and 12 feet depth.
The Belleville boiler, water tubular, on the
same general principles as the Ward boiler on
the Monterey in our navy is meeting with
great confidence in Europe and South Amer
ica. In the British navy the Belleville boiler
has been placed in the Powerful and Terrible,
and is also to be used In two 13,000-ton bat
tleships just contracted for. Kussia has ac
cepted the system for three 11,000-ton cruisers
and several other vessel*. It is likewise being
introduced in Australian, Italian and Chilean
war vessels, but it is in France especially that
this boiler finds its Greatest use in the navy
and merchant service. No less than twenty
war vessels, now in course of construction, are
being fitted with these boilers.
Armstrong, Mitchell <b Co.. on the Tyne,
have in course of construction no less than
twelve war vessels to be delivered by the end
of 1897.
The Italian battleship, Sicilia, has developed
a speed under a six-hour natural draught trial
of 19.6 knots on a displacement of 13,100
tons. The engines were built in Italy, while
those built for the Re Umberto, a slater ship to
the Sicilia, were built in England, and gave a
speed of only 18.3 knots.
In the naval arsenal at Akabane. Tokio, 1308
workmen were engaged last month. Of these

INFANT'S LONG CLOAK
The bisnop sleeve is the ideal shape for an
infant's cloak if made without a fitted lining
as this is, for it facilitates putting the garneut
on and makes the little arms more comfort
able, leaving them free and un trammeled.
The double capes are pretty and servo a pur
pose if the fabric is not very heavy, making
tne garment warmer. If desired, one cape
may be omitted. A binding of narrow rit>bon
makes a neat finish for the capes if they be un
linca.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
One of the most picturesque characters
reaching this City for a lone time is General
G. Reuling of Nicaragua, who came on the
steamer Newport a day or two ago, and is at
the Occidental.
General Reuling is a young mari with wavy
brown hair, and wears a neat-fitting dark blue
uniform, decorated with gold after the style of
the Nioaraguan army. He is scarcely 40 years
of age, and before he sought distinction in
war was a civil engineer in Nicaragua.
But before this he came as a boy to Nic-
aragua, for he is a native of Holland. He is to
all intents and purposes now, however, a na
tive Xicaraguan, for he has all the ways of his
Spanish-ppeaking, dark-skinned compatriots.
Strictly interpreted, though, the residents of
Nicaragua are not all loyal to President Zelaya.
They have been having a revolution down
there, and General Reuling has been coping
with it
This accounts for his arriving with his left
leg in chancery, so to speak. It was swathed
in bandages, because of a bullet discharged
from a rifle in the hands of the followers of
General Francisco Boca at the battle of La Paz
six months ago. The wound refused to heal,
and General Reuling, finding it would never
get well there, came here to iry a new climate
and new treatment on it. He may have to re
main hero several months.
"President Zelaya is one of the wisest rulers
Nicaragua has ever known," said he yesterday,
"and the attempt to overturn the country by
Baca was a monstrous casts ol ingratitude.
The President is doing everything he can to
bring about prosperity therc,.aud he has suc
ceeded pretty well.
"The revolution is now suppressed. Nica
ragua is flourishing. The coffee crop is good
and money quite plentiful."

Everywhere was displayed the white
cross of the home country, peeping out
between the stars and stripes of the pic
nickers' adopted home.
The usual Sunday picnic crowd, which
is inclined to roughness, but which is
well meaning enough, was not present,
and the day was spent enjoyably.
Games and races of all kinds were
held. They were got up in an im
promptu way, the fat women, in their
race ? rising from their al fresco lunch and
joining in the thirty-yard run without
previous training, and suffering afterward
in consequence.
The sack-race, open to all comers,
started off well but was not finished owing
to the fact that but one contestant man
aged to cover more than a third of the
100-yard track. The race was declared off,
to be run at a later date.
The winners at the tombola, or dice
shaking for prizes, will be notified later of
the winnings they have made.
All in all the day was spent in fun and
dancing and was a merry and brilliant in
auguration of the new Helvetian society.
ALMA DESERTS A BABY.
Dr. Marten's Victim Compelled to' Aba
ndon Her Child to Strangers.
The youngest patient in the City and
County Hospital is an abandoned child of
5 months â a sickly, withered little thing
that nobody wanted â the son of Alma
Josslyn, who recently figured in pnbiic in
connection with notorious cases.
This poor little sufferer has been named
Lawrence Josslyn, and was thus given the
mother's name. The father is Dr. Mar
ten, the man who claimed to have a
strange power ovÂ«r Alma, whom he
threatened to kill. He is now serving a
sentence of six months in the branch
County Jail for bis threatening language
toward the woman.
The history of Miss Josslyn's connec
tion with Dr. Marttn came out in her con
fession made last June when she believed
j she was r.bout to die. In April she gave
I birth to the child and fell into a sicKness
which grew worse by stages until in JuDe
her physician and friends believed she
was dying. During the illness she told the
story of her alleged cruel treatment
and indignities at the hand of Dr. Marten,
and friends induced her to make a public
confession. According to her own words Dr.
Marten held complete sway over her will,
which influence she could not explain even
to her own satisfaction. But when away
from him she regained her mental power.
Then she related how the doctor used to
make her live in back rooms, behind
bolted doors, in fact, to keep her a prisoner
on a cold diet, as weJOas heaping indig-
nities upon her.
The doctor heard of her threatened con
fession, and swore he would kill her. For
thiÂ« he was arrested and sentenced early
in July.
Alma Josslyn was then living in rooms
on Mission street, near Tenth, and until a
few weeks ago has been confined to her
bed there. A week since her mother
[ moved her to another house with the older
I child, a baby of 18 months, and the off-
I spring of Dr. Marten. They Jeft little
! Lawrence uith the landlady, for neither
mother nor grandmother wanted him.
Nobody would have him, for tne child
whs aillicted with a constitutional disease
taken from the mother. The landlady
could not have the baby accepted in the
Children's Hospital or in tbe Sisters' Or
phan Asylum because of its affliction. As
a last resort she took it to the City and
County Hospital, where it was taken in
and kindly treated.
"Is tbe child dead?" asked the landlady
last night. "It cannot live long; it was
deceased, and I could not keep it here."
Aima's family will move her this week
to Her home in Santa Cruz County to die.
Her physician says she cannot live much
longer.

NEWS ON THE
WATER FRONT
A Derelict Drifting at the
Mouth of the
Harbor.
SEEN BY A CRAB-FISHER
The British Ships Ditton and
Cedarbank are Now Racing
Home,
AND THEIB SKIPPERS ARE MAD
Arrival of the Bark Emma F. Herri
man From the North With a
Big Cod C*tch.
As yet no one has appeared to claim the
derelict which C. Dominico, a crab-fisher,
says he saw last Friday evening about 5
o'clock. According to his statement he
and a comrade were returning from the
fishing-grounds when he sighted a vessel
floating on her beamends about a half
mile west of Point Bonita. Thirty or forty
feet of her bilge wa-a above the water and
they could see that her hull was newly
painted white and that her bottom had a
fresh coating of copper paint. She was
evidently a yacht, or at least a craft built
on graceful lines.
Dominico also states that the vessel had
some of her sail set, as he could see the
main gaff sticking above tbe water, and
to the spar was attached the canvas. It
swung solemnly to the motion of the
waves.
The fishermen did not dare approach
nearer than a hundred feet of the drifting
wreck, as the water was quite rough, and
their little boat was loaded down almost
to the gunwals.
Dominico did not report his discovery to
the Merchants' Exchange, bnt talked of it
to his countrymen and fellow fishermen
upon coming ashore. He was informed
yesterday evening that several tugs had
passed over tbe locality where he had seen
the wreck, and although they had kept a
sharp lookout nothing was seen. Not
withstanding their failure to find her he
still iusistsuhat he is not mistaken and
believes that tbe capsized craft drifted
away out to sea or has gone ashore.
Saturday the ships Ditton and Cedar
bank pulled out for a long run for <- Mer
rie England." It will be a "merrie run,"
too, for the two skippers intend to drive
their respective vessels over the two
oceans. Captain Stepp of the Ditton and
Moody of the Cedarbank had a bit of talk
a few days ago, and when two such oid
sea-dogs get together on the eve of the
sailing of their ships there are more or
less hard things said. Stepp, who has
been a commander for thirty years, heard
Moody say that the Ditton was slow. He
retaliated by imparting the choice infor
mation that the Cedarbank was an old
wagon.
Then they waxed warm, snd each 9wore
that he would land his cargo of wheat
first or start every bolt in his hull. The
two captains shook their horny lists at
each other and went aboard to get up
anchor. So there will be a straining of
sheets ana braces till the home harbor is
reached.
The bark Emma F. Herriman, Captain
McPhie, arrived from Berina Sea yester
day with a cargo of 110.000 codfish.
BROADER BASIS NEEDED.
Rev. William Rader Preaches Upon
the Current Religiou* Contro
versy.
In bis remarks from tbe pulpit last night
Rev. William Rader of the Third Congre
gational Church addressed himself to the
current religious controversy.
"I spenk noon this theme," said he,
"with the freedom to express an entirely
independent opinion upon the merits and
methods of a controversy which has waged
so fiercely for co many months." The
speaker then proceeded to define the terms
Cafholicisn, Romanism and Protestant
ism, and continued by saying: "The is
sue between Romanism and Protestantism
may be summed up as follows: The pub
lic school problem, the authority of tne
Papacy and Komanism as a politico
religious, National nightmare. Tne
public schools and the Pope is a
real issue. How does it stand ? The
Bible has been practically removed from
the schools, but the system remains and
the flag is still over it. The Little Red
Schoolhouse is the rock upon which the
hierarchy has split. Archbishop Ireland,
Father McGlynn and Satolli, the Pope's
echo, are on the American side.' 1
The speaker declared that American in
stitutions were founded upon a Protestant
foundation and referred to Washington
as the Martin Luther of the state. Any

Papacy he held to be at war with democ
racy, and described the battle now being
waged as one between the principles of
loyaiism and democracy, the reign of the
Pope and the rule of the people.
He continued: "I have no fear of the
result. When Archbishop Kiordan and
Father Yorke try to prove the progressive
spirit oi the Catholic church, they simply
follow Archbishop Ireland and other
liberals in the direction of Americanism.
The Pope has learned that some priests on
this side of the Atlantic are willing to re
ceive religion but not politics from Rome.
It is a (?ood sign."
Soeaking of other aspects of the con
troversy, he said the people were heartily
tired of the subject, and incidentally be
severely _ condemned the excessive use of
personalities, which bad hitherto entered
so largely into the discussion. He pleaded
for a broader interpretation of the truth,
and pointed out that priest and preacher
have much in common theologically, ac
cepting as they do the same creed, tha

cially. More than 500 people crowded into the

Ing flowers, evergreens and deer heads. Chief

address, during which he spoke of the wonderful
progress the court has maae since it was instl- j
tuted four years ago, and declared tbat it is now
not only the banner court of the City, but of the
northern part of the S ate. An excellent pro

the affair, were voted many thank* for t lie pleas

FLEENOR TALKS OF
ROME'S INFLUENCE
Refers Dramatically to At
tempted Assassination
of Dearbon.
THE POPE'S INFLUENCE.
Said Romanism Advocated Only
Hypocrisy, Terror and
Superstition.
EXCITING SCENE AT THE CLOSE
F eenor's Remarks About the Sisters
of Charity Result in His Being
Called a Liar.
The attendance at tbe good-citizenship
meeting at Metropolitan Temple yesterday
afternoon was considerably above the
average, the lower floor being well tilled
and tbe gallery comfortably so. There
were the usual songs and introductory re
marks by Chairman Quitzow, after which
the orator of the day, W. T. Fleenor of
Seattle, delivered an address, taking as
his subject "Rome's Demoralizing Influ
ence on Individual Life." Among other
things he said:
"The cry of the martyr comes to us
from the East. Dearbon is probably dead
by this time. Do you know what that
means to us? It means much to 100,000
A. P. A.'s within the next month. It was
a dastardly, cowardly affair and will re
sult to the final good of the order.
"Our friend Riordan tells us that his
peopie stand for religious freedom, for
liberty. He also tells us tbat Romanism
has led the van of civilization. Now, fel
low-citizens, I want to challenge tbat right
here. The next time he speaks 1 want him
to put his linger on tbe map and show me
the spot where Romanism has advanced
either civilization or liberty.
" Rome's Demoralizing Influence on
Individual Life' is the pu eject to-day, but
next BÂ»nday I nm going to tell something
a out the effect of Roniani-ra on family
life. lam w il awure that the charge we
bring ncainat Rome to-day is a niosi serious
one. Strong says the nineteenth century
i- on probation. He s- peaks for society,
and right here is where I brin^ my strong
est point against Romanism. 1 am in
favor of tesnng every individual who be
comes a p >rt of America. Ev ry foreigner
who c mes here mubt have every veÂ». ige
of for< ignism pre-sed out of himâ he mubt
become thoroughly American. That<an
not be done so long as Rome's church as
sumes thÂ»> at'itude she <ioeÂ«>.
'Every citizen is an evolution of all the
people, liow true tbe saying: 'United
we stand; divided we fall.' Any influence
which diverts full allegiance to American
t>rinciples is an accessory to perjury. It
is the old story of the man pitted with
smallpox, who swote that he never had
smallpox. The Pope may swear until he
is black in the face and the bishops may
swear until they become as spotted as
leopards that they are true to American
principles, but her record in Amerira
stands out in too bold relief ever to be for
gotten. If a man attempted to speak to a
woman in fc-an Francisco socially like the
Poie speaks to Americans politically I
would help boot him ont of the town.
"The history from the first Pope down to
the present shows that they have never
stood for freedom or progress. Now there
may be tho*e who may be praying for an
earthly master, but as for me," I will seal
my eyes with this old flag before I will
pray to any old Pope or potentaie. Rome
demoralizes individual life bjf imposing a
creed for education and culture. Rome
would fill this country with a thin soup
education, but American people will nevÂ»r
be cajoled into any such thing. Now in
papal scnools you know tbe highest thine
tauht is allegiance to the Pope. But re
gardless of all this tbe people "understand
the situation. Old Lafayette understood
it all. He told the Pope to be honest for
once and tell the people of Europe that
what they wanted was not to educate the
people.
"Now, in the third place, Rome de
moralizes individual life by giving beads
for bread. I have shown that Rome does
not educate, but is an institution of ignor
ance, legerdemain and hypocrisy. Mr.
Yorke may call the A. P. A. a lot of
scoundrels, but let me tell you that the
â . ood work is going on and on until this
ku-klux gang is made to feel its poweriul
influence." â¢
The speaker then began a general tirade
against nuns and Catholic women in
general, applying a very harsh and vuigar
terra to 1500 women said to have attended
the Plenary convention in Baltimore in
1870. His remarks elicited applause, but
th u re were not a few hisses and cries of
"Shame, shame." When the excitement
had partially subsided a young woman
rose in her seat, and, in a voice quivering
with passion, shouted, "You lie, you know
you are a dirty liar."
Cries of "Put her out" followed, and in
the subsequent excitement many ladifs
withdrew from the building. "Fleenor
then concluded his remarks without
further interruption.
It is seventy years since ihe first, rail
road in tho world was finished, and now
some 400,000 miles are in existence.

politics in this county, though that is far
from implying a week of pure politics.
Candidates for Judges, Supervisors and
the Legislature are, consequent upon the
hard times, so numerous that all seem
to have banished the idea that they can
rely upon their merits before an intelli
gent community and consider that their
election depends solely upon the combina
tions they can form upon the checker
board of delegates. An Alameda politician
never learns anything. For years the
bulk of the same people that vainly im
agine they dominate politics here have
been beaten every time they came before
the public, yet they seem unable to realize
it. Politically dead, they ]ust manage to
escape burial, and lincer on in the delu
sion that because they are still above
ground they are alive, as though the ma
jority of people killed on a battlefield were
not left to bleach where they fell.
The primary to be held next Saturday
possesses one significant point that must
not be lost sight of by those Republicans
who are such from principle only. There
is an inclination among such to avoid the
primary and to rely upon the best candi
dates running independently to insure
needed changes among officials. This
would be all right but for one thing. The
delegates elected next Saturday, although
they may not nominate one man who will
be elected by the people, will certainly
elect the County Committee for the next
two years. To have a committee similar
to the one now in power means two years
more of vagrant politics and disgrace in
this County. The court records and the
supervisorial records should be more con
sidered than campaign sDeeche*. and the
banner of McKinley should not be per
mitted to be used as a catspaw to perpet
uate any clique of politicians whose inter
ests are directly opposed to those of the
people they misrepresent. Everybody
should be aware of the cry : "The machine
is dead; long live the machine."
Chief of Police Lloyd's letter to the
Christian Endeavorers, published in this
paper a few days ago, although it has not
yet been officially taken ud by that body
seems to have created a very iavorable im
pression. Although the Chief, who is an
Endeavorer himself, somewhat underrates
the practical work of that great army of
young Christians Borne of their leaders
have already admitted that his point is
well taken. Condensed, Chief Lloyd's
letter says that the Endeavorers spend
most of their efforts in singing and pray
ine and organizing, and suggests that a
grand work for tnem to undertake would
be that of looking after the interests of
the little waifs who find their way through
various channels to the City Prison.
That this particular branch of work is
most pressing at this time receives sup
port from the plea of the Society for the
Prevention of Crnelty to Children. The
society's work is now so great that during
the i-ast week they have taken tne pre
liminary steps toward seeking the sup
port of the Salvation Army in the matter,
realizing that something must be done.
There is no more appropriate work for
Christian Endeavorers than that of look
ing after "the least of these," and a largo
portion of the public are anxiously
waiting the next meeting of the City
Union to see what disposition will be
made of it.
Tobn T. Bell, one of the most active
promoters and directors of the Oakland
exhibition, has been doing some thinking
about the policy of taxing commercial
travelers who only operate in their own
State. "A remarkable and yet natural
condition of things has developed from
the system adopted in California of im
posing a town and city tax upon com
m rcial travelers representing manufact
urers of the State and leaving untaxed
those who are sent out by Eastern houses,"
said Mr. Bell. "Oi.e of the leading manu
facturers doing business in California,
whose house is in Oakland and who has
heretofore kept a large number of men on
the road, now finds himself so handi
capped by the increased number of towns
and cities which impose thii tax that he
has been compellei to practically abandon
the field, and his former employes are be
ing engaged by rival manufacturers in the
East who'are not required to pay this tax.
"For t!>e only State in the Union which
has a well organized and aggressive Home
Manufacturers and Producers' Association
to thus by legal enactment discriminate
against its own interests, impose penalties
upon home enterprise and send thousands
of dollars monthly to Eastern cities for
goods which would otherwise be made in
California is an amazing exhibition of a
lack of ordinary horse sense on the part of
our lawmakers."
While Director Bell's remarks are true,
ii is equally true that no city in the State
has shown a greater desire to enforce all
kinds of license tax than has Oakland. In
fact, that city holds the record for the
most unique enforcement of a license or
dinance. W r hen the exposition was open,
which is admittedly the greatest adver
tisement this county ever knew, the di
rectors were threatened with arrest if they
did not pay a license of flu for maintain
ing an amusement house, and it was paid.
That this license tax is opposed to public
policy has been very definitely proved in
thin city. Some months ago the deliverers
of goods to local residences, that had been
purchased in San FranciÃCo, were arrested
for not having a license. The result has
been that several San Francisco houses at
once established big branch bouses over
here and are now doing a large share of
the trade that formerly was done by bona
fide Oakland merchants. 8. W\ U.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1Â»96.
THE RETURN OF
THE MOONLIGHT
Speculators Expect the
Schooner to Bring a
Fortune.
QUIETLY SLIPPED AWAY
Went to Discover the Location
of an Island Rich in
Guano.
NO PHANTOM OF THE SEA.
The Man in Command First Saw the
Island When He Did Not
Knew Its Value.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 13.
Captain Fowler is anxiously looking for
the return of tbe schooner Moonlight,
which left Oakland some time ago to dis
cover a guano island off the coast of Lower
California. Several capitalists subscribed
heavily to aid the enterprise, and they
likewise expect to reap a harvest.
Tbe sailing of the Moonlight was kept
very secret owing to the prevalent idea
that the vessel was to go on an expedition
similar to that outlined by Baron Baro
teau, and which contemplated the forci
ble taking possession of large territory
which is in dispute. For this reason the
Moonlight sailed very quietly and no one
knew her mission till it was announced
that her return was shortly expected.
"Eight years ago," said Captain Fowler
to-day, "Captain Erntt was master of a
vessel owned by J. D. Spreckela and was
sect to Clipperton Island to load guano.
When he eot there he was surprised to
â¢cc the nature of his cargo, and recollected
that on a former voyage he had seen a
large island of the same stuff, but had not
known its value or given it a second
thought. A few months ago I decided to
take the matter ud, and we sent out an
expedition, but it retu ned because the
captain did not have the rieht chart.
We then sent out Captain Erritt in the
Moon light and nis return is expected in a
few weeks."
The prospectus, to which several promi
nent people subscribed, is as follow-:
The island in question was discovered eight
years ago. According to the description of the
discovererâ a well- known sea captain oi good
repute and standing â the island is about three
miles in length. Its width he could not deter
mine at the time, owing to tbe obstacles of
millions of birds. .Besides, he was not aware
then of tbe commercial value of guano and
thought it useless to furtber inspect this island
or to have his discovery recorded at the Hydro
graphic Office and put on the chart.
The location of the island being In a tropical
region, there is no doubt but thai the immense
quantities oi guano which the captain ascer
tained it contained are what is called ammo
nUcul guano, which commands tbe highest
price in the market.
Tbe captain's proposition is to charter a
small yes-el, sail to ihe island, locate the same
in proper shape, and then to bring back a
sample lot of guano of about 50 or 100 tons.
Such a trial quantity would be sufficient for
sending to Europe in order to close contracts
for regular shipments.
The price of guano in Europe ranges from
$15 to $25 a ton, according to quality, and
con tracts for 10,000 to 30,000 tons can be
readily closed by tbe promoters of tiie syndi
cate. Tbe present freight rate by eail to
Europe is from $5 to $b a ton. Owing to the
favorable location of tbe island any large ves
sel can anchor there, and the cost of putting
the guano on board will be very small, thus
leaving a large margin for profit.
According to the captain's estimate, the re
quired capital to make tbe necessary expedi
tion will be about $1200. and be expects to re
ceive 55,000 shares oi stock in the company
with 100,000 shares, uuichit is proposed to
incorporate ai soon as tbe above preliminaries
have been accomplished.
Of the remaining 45,000 shares the inten
tion is to set aside 15,000 shares as treasury
stock, to be sold at $1 per share or more, as
the company may elect, while tbe balance of
30,000 shares will be divided pro rata among
tbe subscribers to tbe syndicate.
It is distinctly understood that parties sub
scribing to the syndicate will not be required
to pay the amount signed for until the entire
$1200 will have been raised. They will then
pay the amount of tbelr subscription to one of
the members of the syndicate, elected by
them, wiiich latter will pay out the money for
the above-mentioned purpose of an expedi
tion, preliminary to an incorporation of a com
pany.
Among those who took stock were Dr.
Boyce, Joseph McÃoyle, Dr. F. Starr,
C. B. Greene and Captain Fowler.
"Our idea," said Captain Fowler, "is to
leave two men on the island and to freight
all the guano to San Francisco. We ex
pect to make a rich haul."
ALAMEDA IS WICKED,
Therefore the Christians Should
Rejoice at the Prospect of
Work.
The Municipal League Requires Certain
Pledges of Nominees for O.fice.
Some Poor Baseball.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept, 13.â "The
Christian workers should be glad that
there are so many sinners in this city,"
said Rev. Henry Victor Morgan of the
Church of the Disciples this morning, "for
it gives them plenty of work to do. If
they were all Christians there would be
nothing to do."
Mr. Morgan took his text from Acts
viii :I0 and said in part:
"The Christian is of necessity an opti
mist. No man can believe in a God of truth
and justice and not believe that truth and
justice must finally triumph.
"Should the Christian worker be dis
couraged in Alameda? By no means.
Why? In the first place there are sinners
here and the Christian worker is needed.
Were there no sinners there would be need
ol no workers.
"Christian workers in Alameda should
t>e encouraged on account of the rapidly
growing sentiment in favor of Christian
unity in the city. God truly has many
people here, but they are not united.
Every step toward unity causes heaven
to rejoice and demons to tremble. There
is coming a time when the church of
Christ will be united. Every day brings
news that the barriers are breaking, tbe
ice thawing, and soon the divisions will
cease and the church of Christ march for
ward 'terrible as an army with banners.' "
Municipal Ownership.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 13â The Ala
meda Municipal Ownership League held a
meeting at the residence of F. H. Ale-
Cormick, 1803 Alameda avenue, tonight,
and passed resolutions pledging Its sup
port to only such candidates for the As
sembly and Senate as would favor the
passage of a law enabling cities of the fifth
class to own and control their municipal
plants, such as electric light, water and
the like.
While they do not consider themselves
a political or.-anlzation, they feel that the
object for which they are organized will
be attained more rapidly by securing the
election of those who are friendly to their
plans. Hence they will make a hard tight
to secure the indorsement of their plan by
every candidate before his nomination.
Cut by a Tin Can.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 13.â A young
man named Hall, from the English ship
Lathom, 1; ing at the long wharf, was
brought to Dr. Keys to have a serious gash
in nis heel dressed. On entering the port
about live weeks ago Hill was playing
around on board of bis vessel, when some
one threw a tin can at him. It struck the
corda above his heel, cutting deep. The
wound has had the attention of the ship's
surgeon but does not mend. It is feared
that gangrene or lockjaw may set in.
riayed Poor Ball.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept 13.â The frame
of baseball between ihe employes of the

market was a burlesque. The game be
gan promptly at 10 o'clock and was played
in a little over two Hours, the game end
ing with seven innings with a score of 42
to 6in favor of Hasry's men. At the close
of the fifth inninp, Combs, left fielder, ex
changed with Morton, pitcher, which re
sulted in better woik in the box.
M'LEAN'S TARDY LETTER,
Sends Many Details Ahout the
Canal to the War De
partment.
Like Banquo's Ghost the Doctor and
His Controversy Over the Project
Will Not Down.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 13.â The letter
of Dr. J. T. McLean, in regard to the Oak
land harbor matter, which he has suc
ceeded in getting tne Board of Trustees to
indorse, contains little more than a recap
itulation of the matter that has been pub
lished several times during the contro
versy over the harbor improvements. Al
though a week has passed since the trus
tees signed the communication, Dr. Mc-
Lean has carried it in his coat pocicet
until to-day, when he brought it to Oak
land fcr publication. After reciting the
details of the work under the various en
gineers who have been in charge since it
commenced, it says:
That Colonel Suter, under date of July 17,
1896, officially reports to the chief of engi
neers, U. S. A., at Washington, "that this part
(the tidal canal) of the onginal project for tbe
Improvement of Oakland harbor, made in
18*4, was based on imperfect Information, and
is now thought to be unnecessary ; and that the
estimated cost of its completion is $512,000,
etc."
That this report of Colonel Suter concern
ing tbe uselessness of tbe tidal canal as a part
of the original plan of Oakland harbor and
that the estimated cost of dredging and bridg
ing the completed part of sala canal is $512,
-000 has astonished the people living adjacent
to said hirbi,r, who consider ihe statements of
said report as not well founded and who de
precate the adoption of said statements by
she authorities of the War Department be
cause of the present and prospective injury
which, in our judgment, would result to said
harbor from a lahure to complete it on the
general plan upon which it was originally de
signed.
That the estimate for dredging the tidal
canal, made by United States Engineers Men
dell, Stewart and Alexander In 1874, was
$349,497, and the revised estimate made by
coionel Mendell in his report for 1887 for
dredging the canal was $413 940, and for tbe
bridging over the canal $200,000. From these
estimates and from tbe actual cost of dredg
ing nearly half oi the canal and of bridging it
at Park street, as stated above, it is reasonable
to suppose that the cost of dredging the un
completed pÃrt of the canal under the compe
tition of at least three dredging firms will not
exceed $200,000, and that the cost of the
needed bridge at High street will not exceed
the cost oi the one at Park street, $60,000,
making the probable cost of completing and
bridging the canal $260,000.
If to this is added the cost of tbe dam and
floodgatesâ estimated by Colonel Mendell, in
1887, for dam, $27,000â say $40,000, we have
for the dredging and bridging ot the unfin
ished canal and for tbe dam and floodgate a
total of $300,000, a sum less by $212,000 than
that reported by Colonel Suter.
The lengthy communication concludes
with an attempt to prove that if the
original plan be not carried out the appro
priation cannot be touched, because it has
been made for the "existing project."
What toe "existing project" is has already
been determined by Colonel Suter, who
differs in every respect from Dr. McLean.

BEADY FOR CHALLENGE
Makes Good Time in a Walk
From San Pablo to
Berkeley.
WILL BACE ANT ONE OVER 40.
The Veteran Sprinter Won the Cham
pionship of Greece When He
Was Seventy.
BERKELEY. Cal., Sept. 15.â Nikolaos
Ethermius Theodorianitis, 76 years of age,
walked eight and a quarter miles in sixty-
NIKOLAOS E. THEODORIANITES, the Aged Sprinter, Crowned
"With Laurel Won on the Stadium at the Olympian Games Near
Athens, Greece.
four minutes this afternoon on the 6an
Pablo ro.id.
The aged athlete's remarkable feat of
this afternoon was, as it turned out, a
"practice jaunt" taken with a view to get
ting himself in proper condition for sprint
ing against all comers over 4o years of age.
Tbe old man, with a number of friends
j and The Call correspondent and artist,
I left Berkeley at about 3 o'clock. He was
dressed in a bicycle costume, with the ex
ception of a big felt hat, and made a most
picturesque figure.
The party drove to a short distance be
yond San Pablo. It was a hot day and tne
] road was dusty, but the plucky Greet did
j not appear to be in the least daunted oy
the laborsome task ahead of himâ of mak
ing a record back to Berkeley.
The hearty old walker started out at an
excellent ga.it, though it varied somewhat
at times from the definition of a walk that
I is given in the approved manuals giving
rules for track contests.
The whole town of San Pablo turned out
to watch the eccentric old Greek. There
were spectators at evsry door, the hangers
on at the saloons came forth in crowds,
! and some of the more curious spirits sad
â  died horses or got out their wheels to fol-
I low the queer procession formed by Theo
doriauitJs and his companions.
The old man kept up a good gait from
the start. Considering his advanced
years, it was thought he might find tbe
undertaking he had entered upon too
mvi.ii for his strength and a buggy was
kept close by him all the way, ready to
give him a seat should he become ex
j haustcd. But the sturdy old Greek never
wavered, lie did not make a single stop
for rest and refused all offers ot refresh
ments en route, and when the end of the
journey was reached, at West Berkeley,
he deciineJ to ru;e to the east end.
All along the line between San Pablo
and Berkeley great interest was aroused
by the veteran athlete's expedition, and
he and his party of friends attracted much
attention and many followers.
The news of tne old man's trip was
known to many Berkeieyans and a large
I crowd gathered at University and San
; Pablo avenues to shake his baud when
nis long walk was over.
The walk of Theodorianitis this after
noon was a sort of starter to train for
greater events. The old man is ready to
race witn any one half his age or over for
a run of ten or fifteen hours and his per
formance of to-day iudicates that in spite
of his advanced years, his white locks and
his wrinkles he has strength and a consti
tution that make him no mean opponent
in a long distance race.
Six years ago, when he was 70 years of
age, Theodorianitia won the championship
of Greece in the first Olympiad of modern
times on tbe newly rebuilt stadium at
Athens. lie entered against 300 competi
tors. The race was won by one Icanomo,
but the 70-year-old sprinter challenged the
winner, ran a mile with him again and
beat him, for which astonishing feat he
was presented with a crown of laurel.
Last week Tbeodorianitis took a walk to
San Jose and back. Now the remarkable
old Grecian contemplates a tour on foot
to Los Angeles and proposes to establish a
speed record for sticU a trip.
Tbeodorianitis first came to the United
States as a visitor to the World's Fair in
1890. In his own country he had won
much fame as a model for artists, bis sin
gularly classical ieatures rendering him of
great value to them.
At the World's Fair he posed for many
artists and delivered au address in Greek
that was afterward translated into English
and won much applause for him.
Tbe hearty old descendant of the race
that made Athens famous came to Califor
nia to pursue bis vocation at the Mid
winter Fair. His picture, painted in oils,
now hangs in the art gal.cry of the Fair
and also in the Mark Hopkins Art Insti
tute's rooms.
As a Grecian the visitor soon made the
acquaintance of C. Demetrek of Berkeley,
who is president of the Hellenic Mutual
Benevolent Society, and he is the guest of
the latter while staying in the university
town, his home at present being at 1334
Market street, San Francisco.
Nikolaos Ethernius Theodorianitis was
born in Theodoniania, Greece, in 1820.
His faiher was a captain in the Grecian
army. The boy spent some time with hiru
in active service during the Greco-Turkish
troubles of 1835. He first went to school
when 18 years of age, but later, when 34
years of age, entered the University of
Athens. He was helped in his coll-ge
days by tbe King of Greece, and in 1856
received his diploma, which he always
carries with him. After leaving college.
Tt.eoderianitiB studied law, and for a time
edited a weekly paper in Athens.
Straight, muscular and robust, he is the
picture of health and vi ality. He has the
appearance and bearing of a hardy
frontiersman, 40 years of age. His face,
tanned an.i brown, is apparently marked
by the furrows of age and not by the lines
oi dissipation. His large black eyes are
kind and gentle and serve as transparent
windows to his seemingly tender and
benign nature. Though dimmed slightly
through age, they sparkle with a gleam of
intelligence whenever the old man be
comes absorbed in a conversation. It
doesn't take much to start him, for he has
a word to say on every topic announced.
His fever of excitement is easily aroused,
and when he becomes interested he is like
a 16-year-old schoolboy railing at a base
ball umpire who bad given an unfair de
cision. A broad, high forehead indicates
a gooa intellect and a retentive memory.
But the most striking characteristic of
the aged Macedonian is his long hair
and his shaggy beard. His hair ia so
heavy and long that it is necessary to
keep it braided and tied in a knot on top
of his head, which be covers from the
outside wor d with a silk hat.
He took off his head covering during an
interview with The Call correspondent
to-day and exhibited a growth of capillary
substance twenty-two inches in length.
He had it braided into at least forty
strings which, when left to hang down his
back, resembled as many flaxen ropes.
His beard is almost entirely while and is
a simple mass of curls. Taking into ac-
count his whole visage, his well-developed
forehead, his wrinkled brow, his intelli
gent countenance, his aquiline nose, his
keen black eyes and his long flowing hair,
he bears every appearance of a historic
Grecian god.
In fact he has posed as Jupiter, Hermes
and Apollo, and his photographs bear
close resemblance to the originals in
marble.
As to his frame, he is an athlete in every
sense, and as he walks about the streets
his step is as light and free as a man who
has seen only two-score years. His well
developed chest and head and sut>plearms
and shoulder muscles would do credit to
many athletes of to-day. Standing only
5 feet 6 inches, his limbs are short and
stocky, but his running muscles, thoush
but little used for three years, are hard
and prominent.
FAIRIES AT THE TIVOLI
The Music of Humperdinck's
Great Opera Has Not
Bsen Overrated.
But the Children Left Much to Be
Desired â Many Musicians
Present.
A vast amount of preliminary puffing
as been heard about "Hansel and Gretel,"
which received its first San Francisco per
formance at the Tivoli last night. This
sort of thing generally Jeads to disappoint
ment, but in tne case of Humperdinck's
opera it must be stated at once that not a
word too much has been said in praise of
the beauty of the score.
As for the libretto, time only will show
whether it can appeal to American audi
ences. Children in this country are not
brought up on folk lore and legends.
When the wind howls and shrieks round
tbe home on a winter night they do not
shrink closer to tueir elders and tremble
for fear tho witches are riding past out
side on their broomsticks. They know
too much, even in their early childhood, to
seriously people the woods with elves and
hobgoblins, and as for a wicked old fairy
popping children into an oven, there is
not a witch in the whole of Grimm's gob
lins who could get up early enough to
get ahead of an American child.
In Germany, however, it is quite a dif
ferent tning. Folc lore and legends are
planted in the hearts of the children, and
when they are old they do not entirely
depart from t: era. The quaint idyl of
"Hansel and Gretel" therefore would
touch a responsive chord in the German
breast when the American audience
might awaken to the fact that there is a
ludicrous side to putting a prima donna
in a chicken-coop and seeing the contralto
careering around the stage on a broom
stick.
A great deal of course depends upon tne
performance in drawint? the line between
the sublime and ridiculous, and it must
be confessed that most of the singers last
night were utterly inadequat- to the re
quirements of the music. The orchestral
score is at least as he:ivy, if not heavier,
than that of "Cavallem Rusticana/'aud.a
considerably augmented orchestra ren
dered it, under the direction of Joseph
Hirschbach.
The young ladies who played the title
roles had weak little voice*, which would
be heard occasionally in the upper notes,
but for the most part their performance
might hare been gone through in panto
mime for all the benefit the audience de
rived from their singing. To criticize as
opera singers either Miss May Tunison or
Miss Ella Prankard would be absurd.
Miss Prankard, who played Gretel, was
considerably the better of the two, how
ever.
How much a dramatic interpretation
and singing help to carry "Hansel and
Gretel" was shown by the work of Miss
Matilda Wilde as the witch. This con
tralto has not only a fine dramatic voice,
but she acts with intensity, and when she
was on the stage the opera went with a
"go" which was sadly lacking in tne
scenes between the two children. Wil
liam West did very satisfactorily indeed
as the children's father, and though Miss
Gertrude Worth's acting was better than
her singing, she made a satisfactory Ger
trude.
The idyllic story of "Hansel and Gretel"
may not appeal to the beholder, but there
can be no two questi- ns about the music.
Even on a first hearing it i? easy to see
that it teems with melody. Sometimes
the tunes are positively rollicking, as in
the song with the "tra-la-la" refrain sung
by the tenor. At other times the themes
are intensely poetical and romantic. Two
of the most striking melodies are the
dance theme and the duet sung by the
children outside the witch's house.
In its treatment "Hansel and Gretel" is
essentially modern. The orchestra trans
cribes the action passing on tbe stage and
does it so simply and directly that a child
can understand, while a musician can de
light in the skill with wdich Humper
dinck has developed his themes. There
were a good many children among the
audience which filled the Tivoli last night
and most of them seemed to enter thor
oughly into the spirit of the work.
As to whether "Hansel and Gretel" be
a success here from a box-office standpoint
it is difficult to predict from one night's
performance. Probably, however, it will.
We owe the Tivoli a debt of gratitude
for giving us the work, but it is inexplica
ble after getting together such a bit; or
chestra and spending so much in mount
ing the opera that the management did
not see fit to prove better principals.
NOTED PRIEST DYING,
Rev. Augustin Hewit, Head of
the Paulist Fathers, Not Ex
pected to Live.
Opening of the Four Weeks' Mission
Held by the Redemptorist
Fathers.
The sad news reached the Paulist com
munity at St. Mary's Church yesterday
that the Right Rev. Augustin F. Hewit,
D.D., Superior General of the Paulist
Fathers, was lying dangerously ill at the
Paulist house in New York City. The
nature of the trouble was not given, but
Father Wiman of the local community
said last night that he momentarily ex
pected a telegram announcing the death
of their leader. The sick man has a na
tional reputation and is regarded as one
of the most eminent men in the American
Catholic Church.
There will be a valuable addition to the
Panlist community in this City within
the next fnw days in the person of Rev.
Ctiarles C. Powers, C. S. P., who has been
attached to the Paulist parish in New
York City. On the arrival of Father Pow
ers two of the brothers of St. Mary's will
be occupied continuously in the field of
missions, visiting in their own work every
section of tbe State.
The Redemptorist Fathers opened a
four weeks' mission at St. Joseph's
Church yesterday. Solemn high mass was
celebrated at 10 a. m., after which Father
Wiman preached the introductory sermon,
during which he took occasion to explain
tbe meaning of the mission and tbe man
ner in which it should be observed.
The principal object to be attained, ho
said, is renewed piety of the faithful and
extension of religion among all classes.
Instructions will also be given on com
mandments of God and church, and doc
trinal explanations of the articles of the
Apostles creed.
The mission is divided into four Darts,
as follows: First week for married
women, second weeK for single women,
third week for married men, fourth week
for single men. This division is made in
order that all people in the parish may
have an opportunity to attend. Morning
devotions during the mission will be held
at 5:30 and 9 a. m., with important in
structions after each. At 7:30 p. m. a
third mass will be celebrated. Confes
sions will be heard from 6 a. m. to noon,
from 3 to 6 in the afternoon and from 7 to
10 at night.
Payments Delinquent
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 13.â Payments
on tbe supplemental assessments of $986 86,
for the opening of Buena Vista avenue,
became delinquent to-day and a 5 percent
penalty is now attached to the $419 07 of
the amount which is unpaid. The Perata
Brothers, whose assessment was $418 19,
were awarded $421 85 damages, so they re
ceived $3 76 in cash instead of paying
money out.
Services Uninterrupted.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Sept. 13.â Services
were held as usual in Christ's Episcopal
Church to-day, Rev. C. F. D. Miller, for
merly of Bakersfield, officiating.
Mr. Miller is residing in Oakland, but
will remove to this city this week with his
wife and remain until the successor of
Rev. Mr. Lane is chosen.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
The Tax Pate for This Year
Has Not Yet Been De
termined.
A LIGHT BUILDING RECORD.
Active Renting Business Reported by
Brokersâ The Mortgage
Tax Law.
Last week was an unusually light one, due
in a measure to the number of holidays.
There is no special change to be noted in the
market. There continues to be a moderate
demand for small properties for investment
purposes and several firms also report an in
quiry for lar?e properties, also for investment.
But as is usually the case when the market is
quiet and prices are low, intending purchas
ers are very particular and hard to suit. They
seem to be under the impression that under
existing conditions they should have every
thing their own way, and should practically
be allowed to dictate prices; but sellers are in
most instances loth to yield to the demands of
this class of buyers, and so brokers arp ex
pe'iencing, even with the present moderate
demand, unusual difficulties in effecting
deals.
The most discussed subject in real estate
circles during the week was, of course, the ar
bitrary and unjust action of the State Board
of Equalization in raising the assessment of
this City a straight 20 per cent. As this raise
applies,' of course, only to the assessment for
State taxes, it will not result in such a very
trreat additional burden to the residents of
San Francisco, an it will add but about 8 or 9
cents per hundred to the tax rate. But the
ran* injustice of the increase is without a
single mitigating excuse, and althoueh the
additional tax thus squeezed out of the tax
payers of this City is not in itself very large,
yet it will be paid under protest in every in
stance.
It must be borne in mind that the Board of
Supervisors has not yet definitely fixed the
tax rate, and they may find in the action of
the State Board of Equalization an excuse for
heaping up additional taxes for city purposes.
Perhaps before the rate is finally fixed it may
equal last year's rate of 2JÂ£. If it does it will
be rather touch on the real estate market, for
the latter hits now its foil share of unfavor
able conditions to contend with.
There is apparently some active steps being
taken by some of the City improvement clubs
to create a sentiment adverse to the repeal of
the mortgage tax law.
So long as this law remains in force it will
be a barrier to the investment of outside capi
tal in this State in the shape of mortgage
loans. It matters not how many apparently
nlausible arguments may be advnnced in
favor of the retention of the mortgage tax law,
the fact cannot be gainsaid or controverted
successfully that the borrower under the mort
gage tax law pays the tf>x. It is perfectly ab
surd to assume that a party loaning money on
real estate is not going to make the rate of in
terest high enough to include the mortgage
tax. The lender will never underestimate the
probable tax, but will be much more likely to
overestimate it, in which case the borrower is
forced to pay a greater amount of taxes than
he would if he paid taxes upon his property
direct.
. If a capitalist or money-lender can be found
who is so much of a philanthropist that ho
will loan money on real estate in this city or
elsewhere in the State at rates that rule in
Eastern States where there is no mortgage-tax
law, and on top of this pay the mortgage-tax
law, he is an individual who will be greatly in
demand in California so long as the mortgage
tax law remains in force here. The foregoing
sentiments were uttered by a prominent real
estate man, who says that he foresees in the
defeat of the amendment repealing the mort
gage-tax law a menace to rapid progress in the
State's development by reason of the impedi
ment that the law places to an influx of foreign
capital to loan here at low rates on real estate
of all kinds.
Bank loans continue light in number and
amount. Private loans are being innde to a
considerable extent, while the builaing and
loan associations find a ready investment in
first-clnss loans for all the money at their
command.
Ar usual with the coming of the fal". season
there is a revival in the house-renting busi
ness, and all real-estate firms who give special
attention to renting are kept quite busy now.
Many landlords are bestirring themselves and
making needed repairs upon premises that
have in many instances remained unoccupied
for many mouths. As a resuit many "To Let"
Eigns have disappeared from houses where for
a while they bid fair to become a permanent
part of the premises. Desirably located houses
or flat", if kept in clean, habitable condition,
will not remain long untenanted if owners are
willing to accept a reasonable rent for their
property.

only five months old, but is very large for its
age. Yesterday morning Artie Stevenson, 6
years of age, amused himself by blowing his
breath inio the dog's ear. He bore It patiently
for awhile, but finally got mad and took a
bite at Artie's nose. The boy was taken to the
Receiving Hospital and Dr. Bunnell dressed
the wound.
PACIFIC CRICKETERS WIN.
They Easily Defeat the California* at
Golden Gate.
The one Hunter-Harrison cup cricket
match played yesterday was between the
Pacific and California clubs at Golden
Gate. It was a very one-sided affair, re
sulting in a win for the Pacifies by 189
runs on the first innings, the call of time
only preventing an innings defeat. â¢
The Pacifies lost the toss and were put
in. Richardson, who went to bat at the
tail of the first wicket, soon put up a cen
tury and retired. He left at the wickÂ«t
Myers, who carried his bat for another
three-figure innings. When three wickets
had fallen, the telegraph registering 246
runs, Captain George Theobald mercifully
called the innings.
The California^ could do nothing against
the bowling of Casidy and Dickinson.
Gellatly, Shroeder and Brooks were tne
only men that made any stand at all, and
the whole side was dismissed for a paltry
fifty-seven. Following on, to play out
time, the vanquished side about equaled
their first attempt, though at the expense
of but six wickets. The game does not
affect the standing of either club. Fol
lowing are the full scores:

MILLIONS IN MEXICO,
Gold, Silver and Valuables to
Be Had for the
Taking.
J. Arnott Possesses the Secret, and Is
Looking for an Inquirer
With Cash.
Three million five hundred thousand
dollars in glittering gold, silver and valu
ables lie patiently waiting to be discovered
in a convenient nook of Mexico, and J.
Arnott of 1007 Church street knows how
this seductive little sum can be secured.
In the mimes- of his heart Arnott is ready
and willing to dispose of an eighth interest
in this convenient secret for $2000, which
the most rudimentary knowledge of
mathematics will show is a great bargain.
Arnott, or rather Arnott' s wife, with his
authority, caused this glittering offer to
be published in the agate columns of
a morning paper, and yesterday they took
a day off to answer inquiries.
The treasure to which Arnott claims the
open sesame is said to have been disclosed
by the confessions of Father Vedga of
Madrid. Just why Father Vedga should
have confessed or how he camo possessed
of the knowledge of the whereabouts of
J3.500.000 in "gold, silver and valuables' 1
Arnott refuses to suy. He dtciares. how
ever, that the treasure is not cash. Pre
sumably it consists of church ornaments,
in which the early churches of Mexico are
said to be very rich.
Arnott does not talk readily in regard
to nis valuable secret. He is possessed
of ideas as to the character of inter
esting news, which he readily imparted
to the reporter, bat on the subject of Mex
ican treasure he was dumb. His wife,
however, stated that they were acting only
on behalf of parties in "Mexico. Arnoit,
however, says he is going down to look for
treasure. At present, however, he is look
ing for "parties having the required $2000
and meaning busines."
Arnott says this scheme is no "fake "
and he says he knows.

NEWS FROM NEW ORLEANS.
A Letter From a Southern Business
Man Shows That McKinley
Will Carry Louisiana.
Those who have solaced themselves
with the thought that the cold Democrats
will be apathetic in this campaign, par
ticularly some of the more hopeful and
blatant silverites, were given a severe
shock yesterday when they read such
names as Clay W. Taylor, John Rosenfeld
and J. J. Valentine in the list of electors
nominated by the Palmer Democrats.
A canvasÃ of the situation yesterday
greatly encouraged the friends of Palmer
and Buckner and they announced them
selves more determined than ever to exert
every effort to preserve the nucleus of a
Democratic party for the future, believing,
as they do, that Bryan wiil be overwhelm
ingly defeated, and that the preservation
ol the Democratic party depends on united
action now.
"We are busy making plans," said
Chairman jeremian .uynch of the Demo
cratic gold party yesterday, "and we shall
be in the field in due time in such a way
as to be felt."
The great activity of the Palmer faction
has disturbed the Bryan Democrats and
the silver men in general more than any
event that has come to light since the cam
paign got well under way. They bad not
counted on organization to oppose them,
but haii lulled themselves into the belief
that the friends of sound money in the
Democratic party would pursue a iet-alone
policy of passive politics.
They now see beyond all question, how
ever, that Lynch and his friends are at the
helm full ot determination, and that they
will have nothing to do with half-way
measures. The gold Democrats feel confi
dent thai they can win many votes that
would otherwise have gone to Bryan.
They are elated over the matter and the
Bryan ann silver Jorces are correspond
ingly depressed.
John W. Dickinson, a student of practi
cal politics, reported the result of some re
cent observations at Republican head
quarters yesterday. Learning that a num
ber of cigar-dealers are giving away Mc-
Kinley and Bryan badges, Mr. Dickinson
made a canvass among the principal deal
ers on Market street, with the result which
he states as follows:
"The dealers give a customer either
badge according to his preference. For
two or three weeks after Bryan's nomina
tion they could not get enough Brvan
badges, but now they find the tables
turned. Many who took Bryan- buttons
have exchanged them for McKinley but
tons and not one man in tour now asks
for a Bryan button, showing that Mc-
Kinley is at least far in the lead among
men who smoke."
The friends of J. G. Tyrrell were active
in the Twenty-third Senatorial District
yesterday. The Lincoln Club, which is in
the Thirty-first Assembly District, a part
of the Twenty-third Senatorial, held a
rousinp meeting at 107 Ninth street on
Saturday night. This club is doing active
work and has decided to organize a drill
corps of seventy-five members. They in
dorsed Thomas Graham for Police Judge
and speeches were made by A. Planz ani
J. D. Byrne. The California State band
furnished music ana there were songs and
recitations by George Reed and J. Spell
man. Twenty-seven new members signed
the roll, nineteen of whom had always
been Democrats.
The roll is now open for signatures at
115 Tenth street, under charge of Secre
tary F. J. Klenck.
The Cutting Fruit Packing Company is
in receipt of an encouraging letter from a
prominent business man at New Orl< ans.
The writer is hopeful of Republican suc
cess in the South. Among other things
he says:
To produce sugar it is necessary to have a
good, round, liberal protection. Rice needs
protection, and cotton manufactured goods
require good liberal protection; and while we
ha^e been voting a Democratic ticket for
thirty years, and the State has been carried by
the Democrats for twenty-seven years, we
have been under protection of a trood oid re
liable form of Government, and three years of
free trade has been enough to make this State
mori than a doubt ul one.
I believe that Louisiana is at least 35,000
Republican majority for McKinley. There is
only one thing to prevent it, and that is
baliot-box stuffing, which is so common down
here. To what extent this will be carried on
in the coming election is the point that will
decide as to whether the State is Democratic
or Republican. The votes that will go into the
boxes will show a large Republican majority
unless something unlooked for happens, and
they are counted as they are cast.
The revolution In popular feeling is so great
that a man seven years ago who voted a local
Republican ticket woud have been ostracized;
to-day there aru more Republicans in the bet
ter c1hs8Â«8 of society than there are Demo
crats, and they will vote the Republican ticket
straight.
About two months more of enlightenment of
what nee coinage of silver means, and when
the masses understand that it does not mean
that they can take 53 cents worth of si.verand
have the Government put its stamp on it and
then jret r dollar in gold for it, but that it
will just be a certificate that there is so much
silv.-r contained in the piece tendered, so that
no dispute can arise between people tradine,
they will be for gold and for McKinley, which
Uii-ans sound money.
New Orieans has not gone Republican since
1874, but I think it U safe to bet that in the
coming election it will be carried by a Repub
lican majority of 10,000.
Next Thursday niyht the Haight street
grounds will be thrown open to the public,
for on that evening tuere will be a erand
Republican rally there under the auspices
of the West End Republican dub ot the
Thirty-seventh District. Ben I. Solomon is
the president of this club, Joiin Bennett,
the secretary, and C. O Burton, the chair
man of the executive committee.
The speakers who are to address the
meetinc are George C. Perkins, George A.

Alice Kdith Dickinson Klythe Arrested
on Eddy Street and Put In the
Dark Cell.
Alice Edith Dickinson Blythe, who laid
claim to half of the Blythe estate as the
contract wiie of the deceased millionaire,
was arrested yesterday afternoon on Eddy
street by Policeman Frank Riiey and
booked at the City Prison on the charge
of vagrancy. She was consiaerably under
the influence of liquor and was so obstrep
erous that she had to be put in a dark
cell.
Her appearance in the Blythe case was
one of the sensations of the day. She was
Thomas Biytht's housekeeper, and alleged
that she and the millionaire entered into a
contract marriage and lived together for
years as man and wife. Through her
attorney, Henry Higuton, sue claimed
half of the estate, and at one time she was
offered $100,000 in casti and an income of
$150 per month for life to relinquish her
claim. She rejected the offer, and finally
had to be satisfied with $9000 paid to her
for a quitclaim so as to obtain a clear title
to the property for Florence Blythe-
Hinckley.
She has been repeatedly arrested for
drunkenness and disturbing the peace,
and now sne has descended to a common
vagrant in tne eyes of the police.
LACKAYE TO LEAVE.
The Creator of Svengali Will Flay
tbe Hypnotist In a Key
Play.
Wilton Lackaye, who Si as been one of
the attractions at the Columbia for four
weeks past, finished his engagement last
evening when he appeared in "The Wife."
This morning Mr. Lackaye will leave for
New York,where he is to begin immediate
rehearsals for hia new play, "Dr. Bel
graff." Mr. Lackaye has declined to be
Svengali any longer, as he does not wish
to become identified with one part, but in
"Dr. Belgraff" he is to have a role whicfi,
in many respects, is a suggestion of his
masterpiece.
Dr. Beigraff is a hypnotist and the char
acter is said to be a very powerful one.
Marie Wainwright is to act as Lackaye's
leading lady and it is predicted that a
death scene between the two stars will be
tbe sensation of tbe season.
The company will take tbe road about
October 1 and will play a three weeks' en
gagement here early in December.
CAPTURED THE BURGLAR
The Residence of L. C. Burton,
Jackson Street, Broken
Into.
Police Were Notified, and After a
Chase of Several B ocks William
Anthony Was Arrested.
A burglar, who gave his name as Wil
liam Anthony and his age as 24, was clev
erly captured yesterday afternoon after a
stern cbase of several blocks and is now
in tbe City Prison.
L. C. Burton owns the two-story house
1426 and 1426^ Jackson street He occu
pies the lower flat and Mrs. Williams the
top flat. Mr. Burton and family are at
present in San Lorenzo and consequently
there was no one in tbe bouse.
Between 3 and 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon Mrs. Williams heard noi-es in the
rear of the lower flat. She asked her son
if the Burtons bad returned, and he said
ne did not think so. It occuired to him
that burglars might be in the house, and
he went outside. Policeman A. B. Thom
son was standing on the corner and he sig
naleo him to come.
There were two burglars in the house,
and they bad apparently observed young
Williams, as they rushed out of the house.
One of them, who proved to be Anthony,
had a hatchet in his hand, and he threat
ened to kill young Williams if he attempt
ed to follow him.
Thomson decided to capture the man
with the hatchet, who turned into Larkin
street, ran along Larkin to Washington,
alone Washington to Polk, pursued by
Thomson. Here Policeman Kelly joined
in the chase and the two raced after the
burglar along Polk to Clay, where Police
man McLaugblin also took a hand in the
pursuit. The burglar doubled back and
ran along Clay to Polk. He dodged into
1611 Polk and ran upstairs to the top of
the building, where he hid behind some
coal boxes and was found by the police
men.
An examination of Burton's house
showed that, the burglars had forced an
entrance by breaking open tbe rear door
with the hatchet. They had also forced
open the front aoor ana one of the win
dows as a means of escape in case of being
surprised.
Nothing was found upon Anthony when
searched at the City Prison, but the other
burglar, who made his escape, may have
had some plunder. This will not be
known till the lamiiy returns from the
country.
SCIENCE OF RELIGION.
Dr. Teed Declares He Is the Bearer
of the Highest
Faith.
Dr. Cyrus R. Teed, the founder of a sect
known as the Korcsban Unity, lectured
yesterday afternoon upon the tenets of his
faith at Foresters' Hall, 102 O'Farrell
street. The Koreshan doctrine endeavors
to scientifically harmonize the teachings
of tLe Bible literally with science.
"Ordinarily there seems to have been a
divorce," the speaker said, "between what
is known as science and what is known as
religion. The world has outgrown any
conception of a practical application of
what is called religion. The science of
religion must necessarily involve some
new conceptions. "
The speaker then proceeded to prove by
scriptural quotations not that the Bible
was wrong, but that the beliefs of modern
scientists were erroneous. He referred to
the Capernicum theory of astronomy as
an example.
All religions, he argued, were trus, but
some were higher than others. Christian
ity he pronounced the highest until the
Koreshan was propagated.
The doctor has a number of followers.
Not 1 ouch but llagley.
The unknown man who came so near occu
pying the grave which was intended for
Mathew Roach in Holy Cross Cemetery is no
longer unidentified. Yesterday forenoon
James Bagley ol 327 Clementina utreet called
at the Morgue and lniormed Deputy Jack
Tyrrell that the Dody was that of his father,
Jeremiah Bagley, a hosier, aged 00 years a
native o. ire, and. The deceased had been out
of employment for some liin, , and it maybe
t!n. l he took his life in despair. He leaves a
widow and one son to lament his 6udden de
mise.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MQNDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1896.
WHY A BOYCOTT
WAS INSTITUTED
American Bakers' Union
Places the Ban on
Daly & Davitt.
REFUSED TO UNIONIZE.
Boss Bakers Cause the Arrest o:
Three Men and Now There
Is Trouble.
DAMAGE STTIT WILL FOLLOW.
A Victory Means a Great Deal for
Every Labor Organization
in the City.
There is a merry war on between Ameri
can Bakers' Union No. 51 and Daly &
Davitt, proprietors of the New England
Home Bakeries. A boycott has been de
clared on the latter and there are other
troubles in store for them.
To-morrow three suits of $299 99 each
will be filed in Justice Groezinger's court
for damages alleged to have been sus
tained by Thoma* Keally, Cornelius Daly
and Walter Hand, who were arrested last
week for disturbing the peace. Daly <fc
Davitt were the complaining witnesses,
and thereby hanga as pretty a tale of iaDor
trials and triumphs as has come to the
surface in many months.
The present situation and the causes
which brought about this condition of
affairs may be briefly summed up as fol
lows: For a long time past Bakers' Union
No. 51 has souubt to unionize the New
England Home Bakeries. The proprie
tors fought the proposition, but so guard
edly as to prevent any actual demonstra
tion on the part of the union. Three
weeks ago, however, the bakers agreed
that some drastic measure must be
adopted, and the boycott was thought to
be the most powerful weapon.
The offending firm was notified of the
proposed action, and then according to
the bakers, Daly <fc Davitt entered into an
agreement with the American Bakers'
Lnion No. 51 to unionize their several es
tablishments and increase the wages now
paid to the un on scale. When the time
came to consummate this deal, however,
the bosses failed to come to the scratch,
and a boycott was .accordingly declared.
A lot of circulars were pr.nted and scat
tered in such a manner as not to violate
the law. An advertisement covering half
a page was inserted in the Voice of Labor,
and then Keally, Daly and Hand made
things very disagreeable for the boycotted
firm, by standing in front of their Sixth
street establishment giving the papers to
whosoever would accept one.
Daly & Davitt sought to have them
arrested for disturbing the peace, but the
officers relused to have anything to do
with the matter, contending that the law
was not beine violated. Davitt, assuming
his rights as a citizen, placed the m-n
under arrest himaelt. They were escorted
to the station, but soon after gave bonds
for their appearance.
On Tuesday last the case came ud for
trial, but was continued at the request of
the prosecution until Saturday. The pros
ecution again sought delay, but Judge
Conian wou.d have none of it. He in
quired into the facts and immediately
ordered the cases stricken from the docket,
on the ground that it was no violation of
the law to distribute newspapers. Keally,
Daly and Hand then consulted their attor
ney, George W. Monteith, and on nis ad
vice will bring the suits already men
tioned.
This will be the first proceedings of the
kind ever instituted in this City, and
hence a great deal of interest is being
manifested in labor circles. It is a matter
of dollars with Daly <fc Davitt, and a
question of principle with the union men.
If the latter win it will establish a prece
dent which may prove valuable to them
in the future.
In the meantime tha boycott Is being
pushed with great vi:or and the circulars
are being distributed.
Daly & Davitt do not intend to give in
without a struggle.
HANDBALL BOOMING.
A Number of Close and ixcitlng
Games Played in the Courts
Yecterday.
Handball was on the boom yesterday,
and several close and exciting games were
played in the courts. At the San Fran
cisco court J. C. Nealon and T. F. Bonnet
played a great game against P. T. Don
nelly, the amateur champion, and R. Len
ihan. It was the best of three, and each
game was very close, the final being won
by Nealon and Bonnet by one ace. The
feature of the game was the all- round play
of Nealon.
Some new players made their appear
ance at the Union Court, and acquitted
themselves creditably. The event of the
day was a rattling gain* in which the old
time rivals, R. Lenihan and J. Nelson and
J. J. Feeney and Terry McManus, the
heavy-weight champion, participated.
Five games were played in fine style,
Feeney and McManus winning the final
by four aces.
Several exciting games were played at
the Eureka Court on Eighteenth street,
but through some mi>undersanding the
series of games between players from this
court and the Mission Athletic Club Court,
for the championship of the Mission, did
not take place.

BARON HERMAN HERE
Young German .Nobleman Making a
Special Study of Forest and Agri
cultural Industries.
Baron B. R. Herman, tall, striking
looking, young and unmarried, is at the
Palace Hotel.
He ia attached to the German Legation
at Washington and is making two special
investigations in this country for his home
Government One is the study of the agri
cultural industries, the other of tbe forest
industries.
So far he has visited the central and
northwestern States and British Columbia
and the States of Washington and Oregon.
While in this City he will confer with the
National Forest Commissioners, and later
will explore the forest regions of Cali
fornia.
He says that Germany has long nad a
very well denned, strict and perfected sys
tem in the management and preservation
of her forests, but is willing to learn any
thing more that may be of value. The
forest area of Germany is one-fourth the
wnole country, and one-third of tbe tim
ber land is owned by the Government,
one-third by communities and the remain
ing thir.i by private individuals.
The Baron expresses some surprise at
the youthfulness of many of the married
men in America, and declares that the
young fellows in Germany cannot afford
to get married much before they are 30 oa
account of tbe expense of maintaining an
cstablisnment. His own estates are in
Wurtemberg.
STUDYING "TEXAS FEVER."
Dr. J. Sidney Hunt Has Col
lected Data About Cattle
"Ticks."
He Will Now Return to Australia
and Confirm Cattlemen's
Worst Fears.
Dr. J. Sidney Hunt of Queensland, Aus
tralia, physician and member of the Royal
Colleee of Surgeons of England, sent to
the United States recently by the Queens
land Qovemment to study tbe "Texas
fever," returned to the Palace Hotel yes
terday after an absence of six weeks spent
mostly in the cattle country of Texas and
the neighboring States where the herds
are troubled in summer by a "tick" that
so saps tbe system of beef animals that
they become poor as though suffering
from fever.
Not long ago "ticks" appeared upon
cattle in a certain district in the north of
the colony of Queensland. The animals
infested by hun ireds of the small blood
suckers soon began to show tne effect in
loss of flesh. Cattlemen had not before
known oi this paiasite except through re
ports of its depredations in America,
They became alarmed. The result is the
tfisit here of Dr. Hnnt as a Government
commissioner to learn about the Texas
"tick" and to see if the Queensland pest is
the same kind of animal. The emissary
was accompanied in his investigation by
W.lliam Collins, a practical cattleman and
owner oi extensive herds in Queensland.
The cause of the "Texas fever" ap,d the
cause of the Australian cattlemen's
anxiety is now believed by Dr. Hunt to
belong to the same family of "ticks." He
learned, however, that little is yet known
in America as to the most effective means
of destroying this cattle parasite. Many
panaceas, he says, are advocated, but none
he beaeves have proved of great value.
Dr. Francis of the Texas Agricultural
College recommends oil as a preventive.
"I think," remarked Dr. Hunt, "that
we shall probably hav-* to establish a
Quarantine over the cattle of the affected
district to keep the iicks from spreading
to other localities. Such a regulation is
in effect in this country, for no cattle are
sent out of the country south of a certain
line during the months when the 'tick'
flourishes. In this way the 'Texas fever'
has been connnea to a particular locality,
but the Quarantine works a hardship to
the cattlemen, who are thus able to ex
port beef cattle only during the winter
months. That will be the complaint, I
imagine, in Queensland."
AT THE THEATERS.
The Many Attractions That Are Offered
for Thin Kvening at the Play
houses and Elsewhere,
Despite the many unusual attractions,
such as tbe circus and the Home Product
Fair, "Madame Sans Gene" has done well
at the Baldwin â in fact, so well that the
management has concluded to present it
again this evening and continue it for the
balance of the week.
"On the Bowery," as presented last week
by Steve Brodie and his company, will be
produced this evening at the California
Theater, and this piece is booked lor the
balance of the week. Whatever may be
thought of the merit of this production it
draws.
There will be a new attraction at the
Columbia Theater this evening. It is en

what the audience at the Grand Opera
bouse will witness this evening. There is
in this play a pretty love story and a great
many dangerous situations for the hero.
The piece will be put on with many stage
effects, including a snow-plow scene.
The military drama, "Ours," is on the
programme for presentation at the Alca
zir Theater this evening. It is a play of
England and Russia and hinges on the

is to be followed by fairy opera. "Hansel
and Gretel," which opened last night, will

of Grimm's fairy tales and is said to have
been well received wherever produced.

A SOLID FRONT
AT SACRAMENTO
Fire Insurance Men Will
Now Settle Their Own
Grievances.
FORM A NEW COMPACT.
No "Sack" Will Be Raised to
Avert Hostile Leg
islation,
FAIR BATES TO BE BEBTOBED.
Tbe Agreement Hay Be Ratified Tbis
Week by Local and Foreign
Corporations.
The signs are now favorable for an early
restoration of the compact among tire
underwriters, which was broken eighteen
months ago. Since the insurance men
began the cut tine of rates which ter
minated in a dissolution of the compact,
a great deal of business in tbe way of fire
underwriting has been done, but the mar
gin of profit was small.
At Monterey some months ago an earn*
est effort was made to restore harmony
and bring about an agreement to do busi
ness on a uniform basis of rates, but some
obstacles prevented a reconciliation at
that time. During the past week several
points of difference have been adjusted.
There remains, it is said, one point to be
settled, however, and that relates to the
representation in the proposed compact
of the New York underwriters and the
Hartford Insurance Company. These
companies are represented by one agency,
and the contention is advanced that they
should not have more than one vote in the
association.
Negotiations for an agreement have ex
tended so far that all the foreign as well
as the State insurance companies have
signified their desire to end the rate cut
tins: war at once.
Speaking of the probable outcome of
the negotiations a well-known under
writer said yesterday:
"While the old compact rates will be
recognized as a starting point in the new
agreement, it does not follow that these
rates will be strictly adhered to. In fact
it is conceded that there will be some re
ductions, but surely the blockbooks,
boundaries, etc., established by the for
mer surveys must be used as a guide.
The surveys and blocking which designate
the hazardous precincts were made with
considerable care and the books are now
available and of course will be used in the
adjustment of uniform rates."
Concerning future insurance, this under
writer said: "Agents are now making
contracts for insurance to be executed
sixty days hence. These independent or
unclassified contracts for new insurance or
re-insurance must be executed within
sixty days after the new compact is estab
lished."
These underwriters, who have been
fighting among themselves for the past
year and a half, now recognize that they
must combine to meet what they consider
a common enemy and face what they
regard as a common danger. This dan
gerous enemy is the Legislature. It is a
part of the insurance history of California,
that money has been lavishly spent in
Sacramento to avert hostile legislation.
At one session of the Legislature, the
underwriters were so "shamefully be
trayed" by the members who were sup
posed to have been bought that many of
the leading insurance men registered a
solemn oath never to contribute a dollar
to another sack. One agent expressed
that sentiment yesterday, by saying: "We
didn't put up a dollar for the Legislature
at the last session and we will not put up
a dollar this winter."
It is well known that every session of
the Legislature has its insurance lobby
and no doubt these agents act with the
countenance and authority of the com
pact. The expense of maintaining a lobby
at Sacramento is probably regarded as
legitimate and money used to wine and
dine members who desire information as
to the merits of pending measures may be
charged un to legitimate expenses.
It can De written d' wn as a lacJ that the
underwriters will make many coricessions
among themselves to settle their own dif
ferences and grievances before the Lie?is
lature convenes at Sacramento. Then if
they are called upon to resist "cinch" bills
they will be in a position to act as a unit
in the opposition.
An underwriter who is well informed as
to the progress of negotiations predicts
that tbe agreement will be ratified by ail
the companies, local an<l foreign, within
the next ten days. Then the underwriters
can present a solid front at Sacramento.
WON OUT IN THE TENTH
Imperials Beat the San Fran
ciscos in a Great
Game.
Both Twirlers Kept the Hits Well
Scattered at the Critical
Stages.
There was one of the warmest struggles
ever seen on a local ballfield dnring the
last five innings of the game at Sixteenth
and Folsom streets yesterday afternoon.
At the end of the eighth inning the score
was tied, and so continued up to the tenth,
when a tuise on balls and a triple by Till
son enabled the Imperials to beat the San
Franciscos.
Although errors were by no means
scarce during the contest they were almost
equally divided and cost one side just
about as much as the other. The San
Franciscos outbaited their opponents, btrt
Kelly kept the local men's hits well scat
tered and was very effective at critical
periods. Cooney, too, did well.
The brieht particular star of the game,
however, was Smith, the third baseman of
the Imperials.
He appeared at the right place at the
right time on half a dozen occasions, on
any one of which, had he made an error,*
the game would have gone to the locals.
The error was never made, though.
Smith successfully accepted thirteen
chances, securing eight putout* and five
assists. Three times he fielded bails to
first when it looked as if the batsman
would secure a hit. He also pulled down
several difficult flies. McKee, who played
right field for the Imperials, and Muller,
who guarded left garden, also did well.
McKee made two wonderful throws to
third, while Muller cut off a man at the
plate Dy a great throw from his territory.
Wilds also deserves special mention, but
the entire side, with the possible excep
tion of Nealon, put up a ereat game.

outs, two of them on difficult chances, ani
eight assists out of eleven opportunities.
Levy scored for the locals in the first
inning on N.alon's error. Murphy's single
and the effort to catch Murphy napping.
In the second the Imperials got three
men arouni the circuit on hit>* by McKee,
Ward and Tillson bunched with errors by
Krug, Sweeney and Scott. They also
scorel one in the fourth on an errahr by
Zann, which allowed Muller to take two
bases, and Scott's second misplay, which
allowed Muller to score.
The San Franciscos did most of their
run-getting in the tilth. Every man of the
nine went to the bat, and although but
two hits were made five runs were -cored.
Monahan got to first on Kelly's error,
Krug singled, Levy went out at first, ad
vancing the other two a bag, and Murphy
got a base on balls, filling the bases.
Sweeney followed with a double, o-inging
them ail home, and scored himself on
Creamer s error, which gave Leonar i a
life. Leonard stole second, went to third
on Zaun's out and scored on Scott's fly to
center, which Nealon dropped.
That ended the run-getting off Blake's
merry men. With the score 6to 4 against
them the Imperials played a ereac uphill
game. Muller hit for two bases- after two
men were out in the seventh and scored
on a pop fly from Smith's bat, which
dropped safe on the first-base line.
Murphy running from first to get the
ball was met by Smith just as the ball got
within reach. In order to avoid a colli
sion Murphy stepped aside and the ball
fell safe. In the eighth Nealon scored on
his doable and Wild's single.
Neither side tallied in the ninth, but in

Sergeant Anderson, who has charge of the

golians at 2 o'clock yesterday morning. The
men were up to their eyes at work making
lottery ticsets in St. .Louis alley when the ser
geant and his posse swooped down on them and
carted them off to the California-street station,
where they put up $ 100 bail each before they
got their liberty.
