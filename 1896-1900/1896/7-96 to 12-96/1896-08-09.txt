TOJLUME LXXX.â NO. 70.
REPUBLICAN VICTORY FORETOLD BY ORATORS OF OAKLAND
OAKLAND, Ual., Aug. 8. â Oakland
was en fete to-night. The Republi
can campaign was ushered 'in amid a
blaze of glory. The flaming torch, the
glittering uniform, and fairest and best of
all Alameda County's 7 fragrant, many
hued flowers, all contributed to render the
occasion a triumph of beauty, even from
an esthetic point of view.
As evening came on the streets assumed
a most animated appearance. The side
walks were lined with throngs of people,
the ladies and children being in gala dress
and all in their best. With the approach
of night the crowd increased in volume,
and occasional bodies of men 1 in uniform
appeared, each being greeted with cheers.
At len.eth the hour arrived for the recep
tion^ of the evening's guests. A most im
posing column of men marched ': to the
railway station at the intersection ol
Broadway and Seventh street. First came
the Fifth Regiment band of forty pieces
in their neat snita of navy blue broadcloth
and silver braid. As they proceeded the
triumphal notes of Mendelssohn's "Har
vest Praise" march, voiced by instruments
in artists' hands,' awoke the echoes of the
balmy Bight. . "i
The splendid band seemed only a fitting
escort to the". Republican Alliance Club of
Oakland, the 250 1. members of which,
marching four abreast, ; presented a sight
as attractive as.it was imposing. This
club's uniform is said to be the hand
somest worn by any uniformed "political
club in the State. It consists of a bine
black military, jacket ,with.gilt buttons
and gold braid, confined at the waist by a
broad white belt ; the trousers are of white
broadcloth, partially concealed by .legging
of patent leather while a simple military
cap of cloth to match the jacket, with a
white band and star, gives a graceful fin
ishing touch to a most effective and taste
ful costume.
â  The members of the alliance car
ried torches, which seemed â  harmless
enough, but ever and anon shot upward
mighty columns of flame, the ... effect ,of
which was to say the least startling. .
As the parade, augmented by the addi
tion of the various Republican ward
clubs, passed The Call's Oakland office it
was greeted by a most brilliant illumina
tion. The Republican headquarters in
the upper story of the building ' seemed . to
have become a veritable Manna Loa of fiery
darts as bright as beautiful transparencies
in various colors adorned the windows,
while rockets, shooting aloft shed showers
of vari-colored stars abroad into the black
ness of the summer night. '
The San Francisco guests on alighting
from the train were forthwith escorted
with all due honor to the Macdonough
Theater," which was already crowded j with
people. The exterior of the â  building was
magnificently 'adorned with â¢ palms and
hung with festoons of red, white and blue.
1 Within the theater was. a dream of
beauty; from pit to dome flashed incan
dÂ«s cent ; lights in lines of twinkling radi
ance. ; In the center of the stage, j upon a
flag-drat>ed pedestal, was a marble bust of
President Lincoln flanked by tiny palms,
whose feathery boughs seemed to wave â¢in
graceful salute to the effigy of the mar
tyred statesman. Falling to the rear and
to either side of the bust were tiers unon
tiers 01 seats.
Senator George C. Perkins presided over
ttie ma rnificent demonstration. Near
him sat Messrs. Barnes, Shortridge, Car
penter, Denison and the other sneakers.

The first sr>eaker was Senator Perkins,
who was received with a burst of apulause
that must have been highly gratifying to
him. He spoke briefly of the duty of the
citizens in thi3 trying hoar. "Four years
ago," said he, "the people in their wisdom
thought it proper to make a change, and
to-day nine-tenths of them believe that
they made a mistake. On the 3d of next
November they are going to correct that
mistake." [Applause.]
General W. H. L. Barnes of San Fran
cisco followed with one of the greatest
speeches of his life. He held his audience
close from the very first, and so keen was
the attention that not a syllable was lost.
The most impressive part of h's address
was that in which he spoke of the mar
tyred Lincoln when a plaster bust of the
dead President was brought forward upon
the stage. The general spoke substan
tially as follows:
Mr. Chairman and fellow- Republicansâ those
of you who are and those of you who may be:
[Laughter.] The Presidential election this
year is a test of the intelligence and the capac
ity for self-government of the American peo- |
pie. Day dawns for us only when our party's
Â«un rises; nieht comes only when our party's
sun sets in defeat. This year is one in which
party lines appear to have been in a measure
broken down, not merely npon one side but
upon the other, and the people of this country
are about to exercise perhaps the most in<ie :
pendent choice npon the greatest question
that has ever been presented to them.
The American people have come to believe

in the doctrine of protection. [Applause .*
There is no longer any occasion to debate that
question. President Harrison's administra
tion left this country in a state of prosperity
and peace and progress, the like of which
God's sun had never before shone upon. Cleve
land, that man who to-day has been spit out
of the mouth of the Democracy, went into
office with a thorough understanding, even at
that time, that the people who hr.d elected
him already distrusted him. There had been
withdrawn from the circulation of the United
States between the day of his election and the
day he was inaugurated very nearly $50,000,
--000. He was surrounded from the outset, not
with theories, but by a condition that might
well have taken all the adipose substance out
of his body and left him sitting shivering in
his bones.
The worst panic this Nation ever saw fol
lowed the inauguration of Grover Cleveland.
Credit was paralyzed; industry and enterDrise
held their breath; capital retired; the smoke
from a million engines ceased to pour out its
welcome to the skies. Doubt and fear para
lyzed even the thought. It has pretty nearly
ruined the country. They tampered with the
best tariff with some few exceptions that was
ever adopted by Congress and the Senate of the
United States and that was ever approved of
by the President of the United States, under
which tariff progress was great, industry met
with its full reward, labor was happy, and
there was peace and promise and prosperity
everywhere.
But with the doubt that came as to what the
Democratic party was going to do with our
revenue system, with the promise that Cleve
land had made to destroy the protection
theories and the protection laws of the Repub
lic, with the conduct of the administration in
reference to foreign affairs more pusillanimous
and cowardly than was ever maniiested by any
nation that ever had a soldier or was able to
shoot a gun, the whole condition of thing*
'began as it has continued, until a few months
ago the American people waited with greater
anxiety to relegate Mr. Cleveland to the ob
scurity in which he properly belonged than
ever bridegroom waited tor tbe day of his
wedding.
I interrupt myself here for a moment to say
to the Republican who is doubtful as to what
he will do: If by chance at the end of Presi
dent Harrison's administrationâ nay, before
thatâ l had been exiled to some distant coun
try, where the Ã¼biquitous American news
paper never penetrates, where discussion on
public questions is never had, and I had re
turned to my native State and to my home
prepared to vote and only arrived here on the
day of election, not having had time to inves
tigate at length the important questions, I
would say to myself, if I were a Republican :
"1 have known this party for more than a
quarter of a century; I have seen it flpht tor
the life of the Nation; I saw it rise steadily,
atep by step, though beset by au enemy In the
rear as well as by the enemy in the front, and
the Republican party was right. [Applause.]
I remember the splendid statesmanship that
was exhibited by the House of Representatives
and the Senate when those great measures of
reconstruction were taking possession of the
country, dissevered and discontented, and
brought it together with every stripe in the
flag and every star shining as sweetly and as
beneficently as the bright light of Birius. And
the Republican party was right.
I saw it with its system of protection, which
brought the boundless blessings, not merely of
liberty, but of life and hope and joy, shining
and moving in every house, from the palace of
the rich to the humblest hut of the poorest
man that gained his livelihood by the sweat of
bis brow. The Republican party was right
then.
I will not allow my notion, my preconceived
ideas, my views upon any subject, to stand
against the allegiance that I owe to sucn a party
as that. When it has met in National conven
tion; when the, best men. of the party have
considered what is best, not for it, but for. the
70,000,000 of people of the United States;
when that great Titan heart is bea* ing, mine
shall beat in unison. I know it is right,
whether I think so or not.
Fellow-citizens, the man who is going to
fight cannot always select his weapons or the
location of tbe battle ground. He must meet
hi.) enemy upon his own ground. If he cannot
defeat him by honest argument, if he cannot
satisfy himself that the proposition for which
he is contending is right, he ought to be
beaten, but if, on the other hand, there is a
party which has cast aside all the traditions,
not merely of its own party, but the lesson
th^t finance has ever taught the world, that
has made a bid for anarchists, for socialists,
for Populists and every other fad that was
gathered together by long-haired men or
short-haired women, it ought to be beat.
The general then plunged into the
depths of an argument against the free
coinage proposition.
In 1792, when the ratio of silver to gold
was fixed at 15 to 1, all the gold left the
country by the operation of a great natural
law, which took it out as much as if the
country had been swept with a search
warrant to take it out of the Nation. Presi
dent Jefferson, with Madison as bis Secre
tary of State, ordered that no more silver
dollars should be coined.
From that time up to 1836 there was not
a single silver dollar in the whole United
States of America. They had gone out,
because the ratio* at which it was made
made it equal to gold, and tbe American
dollar went out of existence, its place be
ing tilled by the Spanish dollar and the
French five-franc piece.
The speaker argued that the "dollar of
our daddies" was a myth.
At this stage of the proceedings Major
Sherman brought in a life-size plaster bust
of Abraham Lincoln and placed it on a
small table standing at the side of the
general. The speaker told of the time
when he had met Abraham Lincoln, when
tbe President-elect baa come incognito to
Washington to be inaugurated. Then the
question was taken up aeain.
The general was frequently interrupted
with applause.
Senator Perkins read a telegram from
Frank McLaughlin, expressing his regret
a t being unable to be present and intro
duced Fred S. Stratton, who, on behalf of
tbe Republican Alliance of Alameda
County, presented General W. H. L.
Barnes with a handsome golden globe as a
decoration and in token of esteem for his
personal worth and for his grand services
in the interests of true republicanism.
On the hollow golden sphere the
emblem of the alliance is shown,
and its inside is lined with silver. "This
silver lining," said the speaker, "is sym
bolic of the silver lining that will be shown
after the victory of the Republican party
in November. It is made of the two
metals, both silver and gold, for the Re
publican party by its platform advocates
and is the friend of both silver and gold."
General Barnes in accepting the gift and
returning thanks for the honor thus con
ferred upon him said in part:
"Well, boys, I wanted the earth; now I
hare got it. [Laughter and applause.]
I know the alliance is a great club and a
splendid organization, and I wish that the
alliance was only as big as it made itself
on this golden sphere, for it goes from the
Arctic to the Antarctic circles."
In conclusion he said he would always
carry this token with him, and if those
wbo took care of his remains when he was
cremated did not rob him he would take
it to the furnace with him.
The Hon. R. B. Carpenter, in response
to a flattering introduction by the presi
dent of tbe evening, said the glitter and
glamour of power and office had now no
charms for him, but, he said, he must now
and ever love his country.
"My country is above any party, even
though it be my party," he went on. "I
hold my country's weal above all sub
ordinate considerations. I am not going
to enter into a discussion on the tariff.
We all know that it takes about $500,000,000
annually to run this Government and that
it must be raised in great part by import
duties. Visionaries have inflicted upon a
suffering public a mighty flood of the
wildest, weirdest literature tbe world has
ever seen. Jf we only knew it, the plat
form of the Republican party is the best
and surest exposition of what the country
actually needs. I deny that the Re
publican party is opposed to silver. I say
that the Republican party is in favor of
just so much silver being kept in circula
tion as the gold in the hands of the Gov
ernment will keep at par."
He tben showed what the Republican
party had done for silver since 1873.
Referring to the nomination of Bryan and
the platform adopted by the Democratic
convention at Chicago he said it was not
the work of the real Democratic party, for
every decent Democrat walked out of that
convention, he said, and washed his
hands of the whole affair. Many of these
men, he continued, will vote tor McXiuiey jl

and Hobart. He held up Mexico, India
and other silver countries as examples of
what the silver standard had done for the
people. He showed that wherever silver
was the current and standard coinage the
people were degraded and most of them
lived in poverty and misery.
"The silver party," he said, "is com
posed of three kinds of people. First,
demagogues, who have been kicked out of
both the other parties and who have
taken up this fad with a view to securing
office. Second, bankrupts, who hope to
get cheap money with which to pay their
debts, and third, people who were like the
preacher who told his congregation that
he was to talk to them about things that
neither he nor they nor any one else knew
anything about." (Laughter.)
In introducing the next speaker the
chairman said: "We are especially favored
this evening with the presence of an editor
of a great metropolitan paper, who daily
preaches through its editorial columns the
principles of our great party. I take great
pleasure in introducing to you Charles M. !
Shortridge."
Mr. Shortridge, whose appearance waa
greeted with applause, spoke as follows:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Even
those who occupy the sky parlor I desire to
ask if they have ever listened to two more
beautiful and eloquent addresses than were
delivered by that orator, Barnes, and that
grand patriot, Judge Carpenter. It reminded
me of tbe days when they visited us in the
Garden City and there helped to rouse the
spirit of Republicanism and to carry the ban
ner of Blame to victory against the hosts of
the Democracy. I have been talking to young
Mr. Stratton, to Mr. Bromwell and Mr.
Gaskill. to General Barnes and to Judge I
Carpenter and to our loved and distinguisned ]
Senator, and I have been trying as all of you
I have no doubt have been trying to get a real
definition, a genuine definition of Democracy.
I have finally hit upon one word. I thought/at
one time when a distinguished orator told iae
he could write a book in four words that he
was exaggerating, but he said he would teach
a lady to walk so as to catch and hold her I
beau by the use of four words. They were i
these: '-Chin ciose to neck." That is the I
direction for acquiring a graceful walk.
Now if you want one word to describe the
Democratic party, get the cathode ray and
turn it on its record and you will find the
word "Nit." [Laughter.] That is the record j
of the Democratic party for good. Nit. For
the last four years it has beep Nit. and I would
advise all of the Republicans and all of the
Democrats who have been wise enough to
come into the fold, when these orators come
and tell you of the crown of thorns that is to
be pressed down on the brow of labor and of
the cross of gold upon whicn the American
people are to De crucified, that they turn the
cathode ray on them and simply say "Nit."
lam absolutely sincere. Did you in all your
lifetime, General Barnes or Judge Carpenter
(turning to each as he addressed him)? Did
you ever hear of such an administration as tha
Democrats have given us for the past four
years? Why, who ever heard of banks burst
ing in this country at one time from Maine to
California? Who ever heard of everybody
being out of work from one end ot the country
to the other during the same period of time?
Who in this audience can, find a parallel to
these years ot depression?
I remember at the time the Alliance visited
us at the Garden City during the last cam
paign we were unable to convince Sam Rucker,
who became the Mayor of San Jose, that he
was wrong in not supporting the protection
ticket, but the other day when I was in San
Jose Sam came to me and said: "I i.aye got
this thing all figured out now. When Cleve
land was made the candidate of the Demo
cratic party the la9t time everybody wanted
tariff reform, and I whooped it up for tariff
reform. Cleveland (tot In and he gave as
tariff reform. 1 did not know what I waa
howling about. We got tariff reform, and now
most of us wish we hadn't. Now they tell na
to vote for free silver, but I guess we don't
want it.
-'The Democrats of the East rise up and tell
those of the West tha: they must work and
vote for free silver. Why, a schoolboy might
as well try 'o instruct his grandfather on how
to run a Government. The West was for free
silver long before the East ever gave it a
thought. I have learned a lesson and I know
what the McKinle'y bill and Bill McKinley did
for this country and I don't want tariff reform,
and I propose to vote this time for something
I do know about." That is the way the best
Democrats feel to-day. They want to vote for
what is good for the country and for sometniug
about which they are posted.
The speaker related an amnsing anec
dote about how he had inadvertently been
asked to speak at Auburn at a Republican
ratification meeting, when the invitation
waa really intended for his brother,
Samuel M. Shortridge. and solemnly de
clared it was not tbe first time he had

been mistaken for a great man. This
elicited laughter and applause, and then
to prove his assertion, be related how at a
bix meeting in New York, at which
â â¢Chauncey Depew was to speak, a box had
been set aside for Tom Reed of Maine;
how he had occupied that box in the un
avoidable absence, and how he had been
mistaken for that eminent statesman.
Having tbus amused the audience for
some minutes, Mr. Shortridge "p*^ a
passing tribute to Senator Allison, the
favorite son of lowa, and remarked that
winle he was in hopes that this patriotic
and able statesman would secure the Pres
idential nomination at St. Louis, he was
now heart and soul in the fight to secure
victory for the grand Republican standard
bearer from Ohio.
"I for one," he said, "accept the verdict
of my party with joy and gladness, and
shall give to It whatever support I can, in
order that this country may not disgrace
itself by failing to elect the candidate of
the Republican party to be the President
of the United States."
The speaker referred to the place of his
birth, which was on a farm about twelve
miles from Dcs Moines, lowa, and related
a story of a hen which had the setting
habit. "We called this fowl a Democratic
hen," he said. "The Democratic party
has always pretended to want to do some
thing great and grand for this country.
This hen pretended she wanted to set,
She went to the carriage-house, on the
floor of which there were a number of
nice, round rocks, and she set on some of
these until the feathers were all off the
place where she sat [laughter], and still
she sat.
"Finally I tried to drive her out of the
carriage-house and tried to break up that
habit, but without success. She was so
earnest, so persistent and so devoted to
her business that I finally took pity on
her, and one Sunday I went out and
bought a dozen eggs an<t put these eggÃ
under the hen. I put them in a nice cor
ner, drove pickets around her and her
eggs and built her a soft and cozy nest. I
noted the day on which she came into
power [laughter] and commenced to do
business at. the old stand.
"I followed her along for three Jong

weeks, the same as we followed the Demo
crats lor three years. Then I went over to
hear the chirps of the obicks. But not a
chirp did I hear. The hen with all her
great and good intentions seemed unable
to accomplish anything. I finally exam
ined her nest, and to my surprise found
she had eaten every one of the eggs and
had not even Mt a shell. [Laughter.]
"So it is with the Democratic party,
though they have left the shell, and you
know tnat if we had not stood by this shell
this country would be even in worse con
dition than it is.
"I told this story to Sam Bishop, who
has now gone to his reward, and he said
that that was not a Democratic hen. He
told of a turkey gobbler in San Jose who
thought he would like to become the
mother of a family [laughter], so he sat
on a bag of shot, and he Bat so long he
finally hatched out a lump of lead.
. "I don't know but Bishop was right, for
all the long-haired and short-haired
cranks appear to be taken under the
wings of the Democratic party and are
brought forward as the patriots of the
country. So they do sometimes hatch out
something.
"I am pleased to be here to speak to the
people of Oakland, a city for which I have
much admiration; which is the banner
county of stalwart Republicanism, and
which is, as has been well said by our
loved and distinguished Senator, the
Athens of the West. lam pleased and
proud to be here, and I am pleased and
proud of another privilege which has
been given me â that I am to speak
a .word in behalf of the Alliance;
that I should present to the Alliance,
through the hands of its Oakland mem
bers, the banner which your distinguished
citizen, Eli Denison, has brought back as
a party trophy from the great convention
held at St. Louis by the Republicans of
the country. I take the most heartfelt
pleasure in presenting this banner to ibis
distinguished and patriotic band of Re
publicans, asking them to place it along
side the likenesses of those other states
men and patriots who have led the
Republican party to victory, glory and
renown. Ladies and gentlemen, I trust
you will all go from this meeting with
pleasant thoughts and a determination to
be loyal to the party and help it to elect
its candidate President of the United
States and place the name of McKmley
alongside of the other great Republican
Presidents who have lived and died that
this country might remain one."
The banner is an elaborate piece of
work and of no small intrinsic value. Its
center is a fine steel engraving of Mc-
Kinley on a ground of white satin. Below
tbe portrait are the red and white stripes
of the American flag, while over it is a
field of ultramarine velvet, spangled over
with the requisite number of stars in
glistening gold.
George P. Morrow, tbe eloquent and
popular president of the club, made a
brief but graceful acknowledgment of
the favor conferred upon the organiza
tion, and Mr. Denison spoke of the pleas
ure it gave him to have any part in the
presentation of so noble a gift to so worthy
a body of recipients.
"And now," cried ex-Governor Perkins,
"let us before we close show where we stand
by giving three rousing cheers for Mc-
Kinley and Hobart." A mighty volume
of sound rent the flower-scented air and
its echoes bounded and rebounded from
cornice to cornice of the spacious audi
torium, bats, handkerchief and bouquets
being cast aloft in the exuberance of
popular enthusiasm.
And thus did the Alliance Club and its
friends from both sides of the bay fire the
first gun of Alameda County's Republican
campaign.

CHICAGO, 111., Aug. B.â This was the
hottest day of the scorching, deadly series
of the week, and the list of victims was
the largest. There were six deaths re
ported early, and the indications were
that the number would be doubled as a
result of the day's heat. The temperature
at BA. m. was 84 deg., and it continued to
rise steadily until 98 deg. were recorded at
3 o'clock. This record made it the hottest
August day in tbe history of the Chicago
Weather Bureau.
The deaths so far reported to the police
were: Mrs. Ella Tracey, Mrs. Laura H.
Walton, Joseph H. Cassidy, Cornelius
Whitman, James A. Rice, J. Eckhart.
Four other prostrated victims were re
moved to hospitals froNn the streets where
they were working, or from stores, and
their recovery is not expected. A score or
more men and women were overcome, but
nearly all of them are out of danger.
Horses drawing heavy loads dropped dead
by the score in tne streets from early
morning till late at night. Outdoor labor
was practically suspended for the day, ex
cept where it was absolutely necessary.
Nearly all the 109 deaths reported to the
Health Department for yesterday were
traceable more or less directly to tbe heat.
The awful record of deaths for the six days
of this weak is 492. Tbe average death
list for Chicago is fifty a day, which would
make the deaths for the last six days 200
over the everage.
Dispatches from Mascoutah, HI., state
that 106 in the shade was recorded there,
and outdoor farm work has been stopped.
There were two deaths yesterday at
Evansville, Ind., on account of tbe heat,
which registered 102 in the shade. The
temperature to-day was about the same.

made by the heat among their employes.
The weather forecast holds out promise of
cooling winds and rain for to-morrow, but
should this fail tbe death roll among those
already debilitated must be enormously
increased.
During the past three days 228 burial

CICLONIC HAILSTORM.
Million* of Buahela of Grain Destroyed
in Aorth Dakota.
FARGO, N. D., Aug. B.â Scattering tele
grams from the northwestern part of tbe
State report the most destructive hail
storm in the history of the Northwest.
The direction was from northwest to
southwest, and it is said to have been
most severe in Walsh, Grand Forks, Nel
son, Foster, Wells, Griggs, Kidder and
Stuttman counties.
It is impossible to verify the resorts,
which declare that millions of bushels of
grain have been laid low. The harvest
had just begun, and the grain all over was
ripe, and will be a total loss.
The special train of President Winters
of the Northen Pacific Railroad was caught
m the storm, and every window in the
north side of the cars was broken and
great dents made in the woodwork. Tne
trainmen declare that hailstones larger
than egjes hurled themselves through the
car windows.
The storm was almost cyclonic in char
acter. The worst damage seems to have
been in the vicinity of M into and Lari
raore. No houses are reported blown
down, but the damage by wind was con
siderable over a small strip of territory.
The hailstorm covered a territory 100
miles in width in the best section of the
State.

SWINDLERS BEHIND BARS.
Capture of the Principals in a Notorious
Combination of Daring
Operators. >
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. B.â By the arrest
to-night of the principals one Of the worst
combinations of swindlers that ever
preyed on the American public and whose
operations have extended over many years
and involved many States has, it is confi
dently believed, been broken up.
Acting on information from Postal In
spector J. J. Larmour, who has been
working on the case at New York for
some time, that he had located two mem
bers of the com oination and would arrest
them at once, James F. McClure, William
Thomas and J. I. Taliiman were to-night
taken into custody on the charge of using
the mails for fraudulent purposes. Their
New York confederates are William H.
McClure and Dr. John Craig.
For years these men have conducted
fraudulent schemes of various kinds under
different firm names, seldom remaining
long in any one locality, and have filched,
it is believed, fully $75,000 from their
dupes.
The earlier operations of the gang were
in connection with a fake lottery at Kan
sas City, Mo., and later on in pretended
connection with the Louisiana lottery, in
which enterprises they have reaped rich
harvests. Lately they have been engaged
in so-called "bucket shop" business in
this city, using various aliases, among
them being "Patterson & Co," "Craig &
Co." and "Thomas <fc <Jo."

fish whatever were being taken. She also
reports that nothing had been heard from
the Peary expedition steamer Hope since
she passed Batti* Harbor on July 18.
Navigators who have had experience in
the ice believe that the Hope will find it
difficult if not impossible to reach far
Northern waters this year, owing to the
immense fields of ice.

tinople correspondent of the United Asso
ciated Presses telegraphs that the Porte's
action in dissolving the old Armenian lay
council and illegally appointing a new
council has aroused the wrath of the Ar

CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Aug. B.â
Interest continues unabated in the recent
news that 700 British troops under Colonel
Plummer whipped 8000 Matabeles and

PERILS OF COAL MINERS
Three Hundred Men Narrowly
Escape Death at Clarke
City, 111.
Thrilling Scenes While the Hoisting
Works Burnâ A 1 1 Savtd by
the Air Shaf:.
CLARKE CITY, 111., Aug. B.â The
burning of the buildings of the Garner
Wilmington Coal Company here caused
intense excitement yesterday, and for a
while it was feared that this place was to
be the scene of another of those mine
horrors wnich are unfortunately too fre
quept in the coal districts.
When the fire started it was thought
that it could be easily put out by the men
in the building, but the flames spread ao
rapidly that before those on the surface
realized it the escape of the men below
was cut off.
At the time the fire took place a full
force was at work in the mine. Not far
from 300 men were below.
Tbe alarm was given to the men and
they made their way to tbe main shaft,
hoping to be raised to the surface, but
they found when too late that all hope of
escape in that way had been cut off. The
hoisting works were in flames and the en
gineer had been driven from his post. Not
only that, but soon burning wreckage
began to fall into the mine and com
pletely blocked up the entrance.
In the meantime the scene on the sur
face around the burning buildings was
painful in the extreme. Many of the
miners were married and had families
and nearly all had relatives. When the
news spread that the mine was on fire an
immense crowd gathered at the scene and
the lamentations of those whe believed
themselves bereaved were heartrending.
Those familiar with the mine knew that
there was one hope for the miners. If
they could reach the air shaft they might
be able to climb the long ladders placed in
it and bo make their escape.
Volunteers were called for to enter the
mine in the hope of reaching the miners
and there was no lack of men who offered
to risk their lives for their companions.
Before the volunteers could descend ona
of the miners from below appeared at the
top of the air shaft, and he was followed
by others/until ail had reached the sur
face.
As each man made his appearance he
was greeted with a cheer, and the scene of
mourning was quickly turned to one of re
joicing.
LOS ANGELES SENSATION
Witnesses Accuse the Late Don
Manuel Coronel of For
gery.'
Miguel Antunez Claims He Saw a
Bozus Signature Attached
to a Trust Died.
Los Angeles Office of the Call,)
328 South Broadway, >
Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 8. J
The sensation of yesterday in the Yndart-
Coronel suit was decidedly in favor of the
defense. The yellow piece of foolscap
paper on which Francisco depends for the
success} of nis contest for a fortune has
been very much in evidence during the
trial, being frequently alluded to and han
dled. With its torn upper right-hand
corner, from which a small piece is miss
ing, it has been the object of curious in
vestigation by all connected with the case.
The defense yesterday produced a wit
ness whose testimony if sustained ''knocks
the bottom out" of the plaintiff's case.
ThiÂ» witness was Miguel Antunez.
"Do you know," asked the attorney for
the defense, "who wrote the signature
'Antonio F. Coroner affixed to this docu
ment?" handing Antumez the trust docu
ment upon whicn Francisco Ynardt's
claim rests.
"Yes, sir," replied Antumez, quietly.
â¢'Who was it?"
"Manuel Coronel."
"Did he copy it from memory or from
something else?"
"Something else."
"What?"
"I have the papers in my pocket," and
Antunez produced two slips of paper
wnich had been carefully wrapped in a
piece of newspaper. They bore the signa
ture of Antonio F. Coronel.
"Where did Manuel sign Antonio's
name to this document?"
"In a room of a house upstairs where I
lived in 1894."
"How did he do it?"
"Put it on top of another paper."
If these statements are established as
the truth, then the trust document was
conjured up and Manuel Coronel, whose
whereabouts no one seems to know,
evolved a most ingenuous plan to steal a
big slice of the Coronel estate. It that
theory be correct, it would explain the ab
sence of Mrs. Garfias, who claims to have
had tbe document in her possession many
years.
Jose Sanchez, an aged Spaniard, testified
to-day that he had been made a confi
dant of by Manuel Coronel. After the
alleged trust deed had been handed to the
witness he said:
"Don Manuel told me had a good busi
ness for me. He told me he wanted me to
look for some good lawyer to bring a case
against Antonio Coronel's estate. 'This
will open the case,' he said, and he pulled
out this paper. Bat be said it was not fin
ished yet. Another witness, Guzman, had
to sign. I saw him again five or six days
after that. Manuel asked if I had seen any
lawyers. He told me not to tell any one
about the document. He pulled it out,
and there was Guzman's signature. I saw
it a fourth time in February, 1895. Don
Manuel still had it. When I first saw the
paper it was in the same condition it is
now; the piece on the corner was torn off."
Jose said that his friendly relations con
tinued with Don Manuel until September
last, when Manuel told him that all had
been discovered.
PAID TO LEAVE THE CITY.
JStartling Charge Made by a Wittiest
Against George McDonald.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. B.â Several
weeks ago the little daughter of Sarah
Campbell, a colored woman of this city,
reported to her mother that an attack
had been made upon her by George Mc-
Donald, son of a wealthy resident of this
city, living on Adams street. McDonald's
arrest followed, and he was given his
liberty after procuring a heavy bond. At
his preliminary examination no witnesses
could be produced by tde prosecution and
the case collapsed. Both the Campbell
woman and her daughter had disappeared,
no one knew where.
Now the woman has returned and she
claims that she was paid $400 to absent
herself and daugnter from the city until
the case against young McDonald was dis
missed. In consequence the authorities
are arranging preliminaries, it is said, to
renew the proceedings against the al
leged criminal.
FINISH AT LONG BEACH.
Clote of th* Christian Women* School
of Methods,
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Aug. 8. â The
School of Methods under the auspices of
the Women's Christian Temperance Union
of Southern California at Long Beach
closed to-day. Yesterday was "suffrage
day," the institute being addressed by
Mesdames Alice Moore McComas, Lulu
Pile Little and Miia Tupper Maynard of
this city. Mrs. Elmira Stephens made a
special plea for help and over $43 was sub
scribed to the county campaign fund.
Every lady present promised to hold a par
lor meeting as soon as she arrived home.
Besides the addresses bearing on the
work of the suffrage campaign, Miss Ada
Bisbee read a paper on "The Triple Link"
and Miss Emma Harriman on "How Shall
We Make the Indifferent Different?" The
subject of Mrs. Annie Arnold's paper was
"Finance." Mesdames Mary E. Girbutt
and Lulu Hall conducted the devotional
exercises.
To-day the State executive held a meet
ing of great interest to the Women's
Christian Temperance Union. Union
temperance and platform gospel meetings
were held to-night.
SUES THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC.
Heavy Damages Demanded for the
Maiming of a Switchman.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. B.â David
A. Madden, 43 years of age, has a hanker
ing after $40,000, and, though that is a big
Bum of money for a day laborer, it is
doubtful if any one would accept it and go
through the experience that has prompted
Madden to claim this amount as damages
from the Southern Pacific Company.
Madden was a switchman at the River
station, and in November of last year,
while in tne discharge of his duty," was
caught between two cars. He was con
fined to the hospital for some time, and is
now paralyzed, suffering from locomotor
ataxia. In the complaint he has filed he
alleges that in coupling the cabooses be
tween which he was jammed it was neces
sary to raise the coupling- pin, and yet so
negligently had the cabooses been con
structed that they closed together, making
it impossible for a man to occupy the posi
tion ordinarily taken in coupling cars.
COMPLETED TO FRESNO,
Valley Road Graders Arrive at
the Outskirts of the
City.
Further Progress B ocked by the
Action of Q and Diana Street
Residents.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. B.â Grading on
the San Joaquin Valley Railway between
San Joaquin River and Fresno was com
pleted this evening. On Monday teams
will put on the finishing touches along
the line and then the roadbed will be
ready for the rails.
Grading contracts covering a distance of
ten miles between this city and tbe river
were let in live sections. Grant Brothers
had the section next to the river, and their
contract was the heaviest one, as they had
to build a high embankment for an ap
proach to the bridge, but they pushed
matters from the beginning and, as prom
ised, had the work finished this afternoon.
Hunt's section, this side of Grant Broth
ers', was finished yesterday afternoon.
The next two sections were completed a
few days ago. McDougald's, the fifth,
was finished this evening. McDougald
had .to build an embankment ten feet high
for three miles across a swale. Hendricks
had a contract for a short section at this
end and he was through last evening.
The grade stops at Belm^nt avenue,
which runs alonz the north limit of the
city additions. The grade of the railroad
ia exactly the same as that of the public
highway, and it strikes Belmont avenue
in line with Diana street, which begins on
tbe other side of the avenue. The point
where the grade stops is nearly a mile
from the depot site of the new road on Q
street.
The completion of grading to the city is
important "news to Fresno, but the elation
with which the event would have been re
ceived is dampened by the still deter
mined attitude of Q and Diana street
property-owners, who demand what are
considered very unreasonable damages for
the passage of the road by their places. In
fact in the disappointment over the action
of these property-owners the importance
of the completion of the grading is
practically forgotten.
Teams and tracklayers will stay in
Fresno and wait to proceed into the city
with the road. When this will be no one
can tell, but it is likely that the trouble
with the property-owners along Q and
Diana streets will be settled in a few
weeks. The committees which have in
charge the securing of rights-of-way south
of Fresno are making rapid progress, and
will be ready for the railroad as soon as it
gets through the city.
Attorney R. E. Rhodes, on behalf of the
Valley road, to-day filed notice in the Su
perior Court that on Thursday next he
would move for a new trial of the con
demnation case against D. Dismukes, who,
a few days ago was awarded $3500 by a
jury for property on the depot site in this
city, which is considered to be worth only
$2500.
Summoned to Rome.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. B.â Rev.
Charles M. Driscoll, O. 8. A., provincial of
the Augustinian order of America, has
been summoned to Rome, and sails from
New York to-day. The summons of
Father Driscoll to Rome ieaves no doubt
that Mgr. Satolli has been recalled and
that Mgr. Sebastian Marti nelli has been
appointed Papal delegate to America.
Mgr. Martinelli is prior-general of the
Augustinian order, and the only reason
there can be for summoning Father Dris
coll is to assist In the election of a succes
sor to the prior-general.

THE CELTIC UNION.
Irish Societies, Through Delegates,
Convene and Resume Organization
of the League.
A convention of delegates to the Celtic
League was held last evening at K. R. B.
Hall, on Mason street, near O'Farreil.
The delegates represented most of the
Irish societies of the City, of which there
are about thirty. Each society is entitled
to a representation of fiye delegates.
Saturday night made so many demands
upon the time of delegates that tbe meet
ins was not full. There was a fair repre
sentation, but it was thought best that an
adjournment should be taken. The con
vention will again meet at the same place
one week from Tuesday night.
The principal business to be transacted
at that time will be the election of officers.
A constitution and set of by-laws have
already been adopted by the representa
tives of the societies which are enrolled in
the league. Tbe outlook is that all Irish
societies in tbe City will come in.
When the officers shall have been elected
and the organization of the Celtic
League has bean thereby perfected
the next important business will be
tbe consideration and adoption of
plant for a large and handsome ball
which it is the purpose of the league to
erect. Certain plans have been submitted
and have received some consideration, but
nothing final has been effected in that
direction. At last night's meeting of the
delegates Colonel ThomasF.Barry presided
and R. J. O'Reilly acted as secretary.
The discussion was general and all in the
direction of proceeding vigorously with
the organization.
OR, C. 0. BROWN'S WRATH
Finds Vent in Vigorous Denun
ciation of Mrs. Tunnell and
Her Charges.
Says She Lies for Money and Is One
of the Gang Seeking to
Bleed Hi.
CHICAGO, 111., Au?y. B.â Rer. C. O.
Brown, formerly of San Francisco and who
was recently mixed up in a church scandal,
in which Mattie Overman took a leading
part, is now in Chicago. Mr. Brown, when
seen by a reporter regarding the charges
just made by Mrs. Tunnell, entered a most
vigorous denial. He made a written state
ment, as follows:
Mrs. Tunnell is herself one of the gang seek
ing to bleed me. This was learned from Miss
Overman before sue left our home on her sud
den departure for the southern part of Califor
nia. It was Mrs. Tunnell who went witn Miss
Overman and waited outside while the former
tried, according to her own testimony, to sell a
story to the Chronicle.
Mrs. Tunnell's story is full of falsehoods.
Let the public recall that she herself, in re
peated interviews with the reporters of The
Call and Examiner, said that she knew abso
lutely nothing against my character. She
said, also, that she did not leave San Fran
cisco at my suggestion to avoid testifying
against me, but solely on her own account,
because Bhe feared that her intimacy with
Miss Overman would involve her in newspaper
notoriety. _ . m 'â '. M
These interviews she afterward confirmed,
as Miss Overman wrote my wife. Her own
past life (twice married and twice divorced,
her last husband a mere boy of 19 years while
she was nearly 50) reveals that she had ample
reason to avoid the reporters. Aside from her
unhappy marital experiences there was an
other and more serious matter.
When Mrs. Davidson was arrested Mrs. Tun
nell undoubtedly feared that her own con
nection with the attempt to blackmail me
might lead to her arrest. Those were matters
of which I was wholly ignorant when Mrs.
Tunnell left the City. There are good reasons
to believÃ that she shared Mrs. Davidson's
plunder.
'â¢In the southern part of California she told
some people that her name was 'Mrs. Baker,'
others that it was -Mrs. Fowler,' others that it
was 'Mrs. Flower.' There will bo few so simple
as to believe that such a person would go into
hiding for months to gave me or my family, as
she claims. We had barely met the woman,
and at that time knew almost nothing of her.
She went to save herself.
She claims now to be actuated by a sense of
duty in re-passing Mrs. Davidson's story. Who
will believe that a woman who went away and
persistently hid herself when her testimony
was wanted before the council, who told so
many conflicting stories about her name and
identity, is really at this laic hour actuated by
any high sense of duty in going into the news
papers? ll er story of what she alleges I said
to her is pure fiction.
The simple fact is that she, like the other
plunderers, lied for money. The story that I
sent her money, other than the few dollars
frankly admitted to the council and for the
entirely innocent reason there set forth, Is ab
solutely false.
What, then, is the fact and what motive
has promoted her at this late hour to lie
through the newspapers? The following brief
statement will show very clearly:
Just before Miss Overman's return to San
Francisco she wrote us that for a sufficient
sum of money Mrs. Tunnell would make an
ample affidavit in my favor; otherwise she
would publish a story against me. She af
firmed that newspaper reporters were after
them and that large offers were being made if
they would only speak against me ; but Mrs.
Tunnell would swear for me if the money
were forthcoming.
I refused that proposition absolutely. When
Mrs. Tunnell and Miss Overman returned to
San Francisco they tried repeatedly to get into
communication with me, as my friend Deacon
Morse Knows, and he also knows that I refused
absolutely either to see or communicate with
either of ihem.
Mrs. Tunnell, failing to get money from me
for an affidavit which she offered in my favor,
has waited until I am more than 2000 miles
away from her and has sold her lies to my
enemies. She has done what she dared not do
when I was there to defend myself.
The thousands who know me In this part of
tbe land will, I Â«m sure, say that this nefarious
scheme hat gone mr enough; that the public
should have a rest from these slanders, and
that those who have come into undue promi
nence by this attack on my character should
be allowed to retire. Charles O. Brown.

CON VIU CINQ ARGUMENTS GIVEN
How Financial Integrity Must Be
Maintained and the Nation's
Prosperity Renewed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. B.â Vice-
Chairman Apsley of the Republican Con
greassional Committee, accompanied by
Representative McCall of Massachusetts,
expects to start West next Wednesday for
a tour of observation. Mr. McCall will
make same speeches, while Mr. Apsley
seeks to get an insight Into the true con
dition of affairs in the territory visited.
The Slates to be visited are Nebraska, the
Dakotas, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington,
California and Colorado. They expect to
be gone upward of two months.
The campaign book was issued this after
noon from Republican headquarters. It
makes a neat-looking volume of 410 pages.
Chairman Apsley says its distribution will
be largely in the hands of the National
Committee. The first edition consisted of
20,000 copies. Under the caption of
"Issues,'' the following are among the
most important set forth :
Coin, whether gold or silver, must be
equal to the best. Financial integrity and
money enough to pay all bills; gold and
silver, equal dollars for all business; home
markets for American products; imports
must always be kept below exports; judi
ciary of the United States must not be
tampered with ; ownership of railroads by
the Government is opposed by the Repub
lican party. Tariff to protect American
labor and encourage home industry ; pen
sions for veterans of the war equal to the
pledge of the Nation.
The subject matter of the boole deals
with a great variety of topics and is pre
sented in an attractive manner. The
committee believes that the whole volume
will be valuable as a reference book for
speakers, and as a guide for those who are
endeavoring to acquaint themselves with
the current questions of the day. Among
the matter presented under appropriate
heads are strong quotations from leading
Democratic newspapers, giving the rea
sons why they do not support the Chicago
ticket; an article on American advance
ment, with articles against a change in
the financial system; quotations from
the message of President Harrison of
December 6, 1892, on the great prosperity
of the country, with particular reference
to the farmiug communities and agricul
turists; Representative Cannon's view of
the appropriations of the last session of
Congress; Historical matter concerning
the industries of the country, present and
past; essays on special subjects, such as
bimetallism, the bond issues of the United
States, the history of the Bland-Allisoa
act, ect.
AS APPEAL, TO VETERANS.
Asked to Preserve the Honor of the
Xation by Electing McKinley.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. B.â The
Union Veterans' Patriotic Leaeue, which
was organized recently to support Mc-
Kinley, issued an address to-day which
will be sent to every veteran in the United
States. It is in part as follows:
New Yokk, August 8, 1896.
To the Surviving Soldiers and Sailor* who Served
in the Union Army and Wavy During the War of
the Kebellion â Comeapes: Your country is
again ;n peril. In the prevent Presidential
campaign dangerous combinations again
threaten the integrity of the Government.
Misguided and unscrupulous men conspire to
bring repudiation, dishonor and financial
ruin upon the Nation once saved by your
valor.
ComradeÃ, you believe in liberty under law;
In public order; in the maintenance of our
courts of justice and in National honor and
good faith. You are unalterably opposed to
the red flag of anarchy and mob rule. We be
lieve that you resent with earnestness all at
tacks upon the executive and judicial depart
ments of our Government, and commend all
measures which vindicate the supremacy of
the law and restore public order whenever en
dangered.
Many of our great leaders have been mus
tored out â Grant, Sherman, Shertdan, McClel
lan, Hancock, Burnside, Garfield, Logan, Dix
and many others have gone to their reward.
Were they living they would be united with
us in this crisis as they were in the days of the
war. It remains for us to guarantee the good
â work they upheld while living, and to preserve
the peace they all helped us to gain for our
country.
Should thU dangerous and revolutionary
conspiracy against the financial honor and in
tegrity of the Government succeed, .every pen
sioner, every depositor in saving banks, every
policy holder in any company, co-operative
and building and loan association and assess
ment society would lose one-half of what is
due him by being paid fifty-cent silver dollars.
Feeling assured that in this crisis you, the
Union veterans of the late war, are surely in
favor of an honest Government, we appeai to
you to lay aside all partisan differences and
rally to the support of our gallant comrade,
Major McKinley. We urge yon to form your
selves into an association to be known as "The
Union Veterans' Patriotic Leaeue" and do all
iv your power to secure the triumph of right.
We invite all sons of veteran societies to unite
with us in this campaign against National dis
honor.
The address has about seventy-five sig
natures of former major-generals and offi
cers in the United States army, at the
present time. Among them are Daniel N.
Sickles, Horace Porter, Franz Siegel, L.
Edwin Dudley and Oliver O. Howard.
Former President Harrison wrote that
while he was not In this city to affix his
signature to the address, he was in sym
pathy with it.
UUEbTIA'GS FOB McKISIjEY.
The Major Cheered by Caller* and an
l.nthuainntie Telegram.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. B.â Major McKin
ley's callers 10-day included the members
of tfie Ohio Canal Commission, who are on
i tour of inspection of canals in the Stale.
J.iiies R. Ruwen of lowa, chief clerk of
tie House of Representatives, and Colonel
(i y V. Henry of the United States army
aUo called. All of these callers simply
de ired to pay their respects to the major.
Another telegram came from Red Bluff,
Cal., to-day in this form:
Eon. William McKinley: McKlnley and Hc
bart Club of Red Bluff, 250 strong, send greet
ings to the champions of their cause, protec
tion to American labor and honest money, and
assure you that our cause daily grows stronger
No doubt about California. Such enthusiasm
for Presidential candidate never before mani
fested. F. H. Albbight, President.
George A. Delashmutt, Secretary.
Many other telegrams and letters an
nouncing the formation of clubs, etc,
came from Eastern States.
AT THE HEADQUARTERS,
Lively Campaign Work to Begin With
Hanna'a Arrival.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. B.â There was
little business done at Republican National
headquarters to-day partly on account of
the absence of all the committeemen ex
cept Mr. Dawes and because of the great
heat. There will be a lively resumption
of campaign work Monday morning, when
Mr. Hanna and his Cleveland staff take
possession of the headquarters. The
speakers' bureau to-day assigned Senator
Thurston to speak at Ottumwa, lowa,
August 15.
NATIONAL DEMOCRATS.
The Sew Party to LoÂ»e Xo Time in Pro-
ceeding to Work.
INDIANAPOLIS, Inc., Aug. B.â The
executive committee of the National
Democratic party held its first meeting to
day. W. D. Bynum was chosen chairman
and John R. Wilson of Indianapolis
secretary. This committee on transpor
tation was appointed: Hopkins of Illinois,
chairman ; Falkner of Alabama and Hold
ing of Ohio.
The committee on campaign literature
is composed of Cutcheon of Minnesota and
Usher of Wisconsin. Inasmuch as a
demand for sound-money literature is
simply tremendous the committee was
ordered to at once go about getting docu
ments together. The demand, says Sec
retary Wilson, is particularly great in
Indiana. Messrs. Bynum and Wilson
were authorized to select headquarters in
Indianapolis to be used until the National
Convention at least. They have not deter
mined where permanent headquarters will
be located. An address to the public is
being prepared by the executive com
mittee. Secretary Wilson says that it will
be ready for publication within a week.
John J. Rooney, secretary of the Demo
cratic Honest Money League of America,
with headquarters in New York, appeared
before the committee to offer the sound
money party all the aid that it can pos
sibly give. This league is a month old
and was oiganized for the single purpose
of defeating the Chicago ticket. Major
John Byrne, formerly of Detroit, now of
New York, is president and ex-Governor
Flower of New York is treasurer. The
league's minor officers and its member
ship, Mr. Rooney says, are filled with
men prominently identified in the New
York business world. His offers of assist
ance to the committee were gladly ac
cepted and he was asked to forward all tiie
literature at his command at once. He
notified the committee that two days after
Bryan makes his speech in New York
Bourke (Jockran will make a reply. The
committee has not yet chosen its commit
tee on finance. It will meet again in
Chicago at the Palmer House August 17.
JONES IS NOT ALARMED.
Tiewa With Complacency the Action of
Sound Money Democrat*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. B.âChair
man Jones of the National Democratic
Committee views with complacency the
action of the Sound Money Democrats at
Indianapolis yesterday in calling a con
vention for the nomination of a ticket and
the adoption of a platform in consonance
with the views of that wing of tbe party.
"This action," said he, "will for obvious
reasons have no effect on the general re
sult. In the middle Western States,
where the battle is to be fought, the
Democrats are more independent of action
than they are in the East, and the lines of
battle have been sharply drawn. In that
country every man Has made up his
mind, or will by the day of election, and
the fight will be squarely between Bryan
and free silver on one side and the Mc-
Kinley and the gold standard on the
other. The ticket to be nominatod by the
Indianapolis contingent will not affect
these men. In the East the case may be
different, but the result will be the sanie."
Ratify Populittic Action.
LARNED, Kans., Aug. B.â The Demo
cratic and Populist conventions of the
Seventh Kansas Congressional District
met here to-day. The Democrats ratified
the action of the Populists,who nominated
Jerry Simpson by acclamation.
GENERAL MILES VIGILANT
Does Not Forget the Pacific
Coast in Recommendations
for Defenses.
Various Improvements Are to Be
Made at Many of the Navy-
Yards.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. B.â ln his
recent recommendations to the Secretary
of War in regard to coast defenses Major-
General Miles did not forget tne Pacific
Coast. It is understood that he has recom
mended to Secretary Lamont that a new
artillery station be established at Lime
Point, near San Francisco. This is in ad
dition to other recommendations he lias
made urging the establishment of similar
stations at Forts HancocK, Trumbull,
Washington, and at Charleston, 8. C, and
Savannah, Ga.
All of these places are on the Atlantic
coast. General Miles regards Lime Point
as a most important point for defense, and
in. his recommendations to Secretary La
mont points out the necessity of having
men at these places to give proper atted
tion to tiie batteries there.
Chief Naval Constructor Hichborn has
recommended to the Navy Department,
and his recommendation has been adopted, !
that Mare Island. New York and Norfolk
navy-yards be furnished with a supply of
deck planks. Tee necessity of keeping
such planks at the yards has been mori
than once demonstrated. This is particu
larly true of Mare Island, where a large
number oT ships have recently arrived
whose decks needed repairing. In order
to keep the planks dry the Chief Con
structor recommended that houses for
their accommodation be erected at the
several yards where they are to be stored.
Civil Engineer Endicott, who is nctin^
as Chief ol the Bureau ol Yards and Docks'
has s?nt communications to the com
mandants of the several yards directing
tueni to draw up plans for such nouses
with estimates of cost, and to send them
immediately to the War Department.
The department has approved the plans
for the new caisson to be constructed for
the Mare Island dock, and orders have
been sent to the Mare Island yard direct
ing the department of construction thore
to build it. The old caisson will be re
tained in the dock until the new one is
completed, so that there will be no neces
sity of placing the structure out of com
mission.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
BRYAN ENTERS
CHICAGO TOWN,
Thousands Turn Out to See
the Candidate From
Nebraska.
LISTEN TO HIS SPEECH.
Plenty of Platitudes Intended
Particularly to Please
the People.
SOME INCIDENTS OF THE TRIP
At One Town the Engineer Cut Short
the Talk, While McKinley Was
Cheered at Another.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. B.â Sweltering in
the sultry heat of the night, half a hun
dred thousand men and women crowded
the stree-ts of the downtown districts to
show by their presence and vociferous
demonstration their welcome of William
J. Bryan on his arrival in Chicago. It
was an Indiscriminate outpouring of the
common people, without any semblance of
an orderly procession from the depot to
the hotel. A programme of arrangements
had been made, but it was not carried out.
Thousands of members of the Democratic
party, Cook County Silver CJub, People's
party organizations, Cook County Demo
cratic Central Committee. Cook County
Democratic Marching Club, trades unions
and citizens generally participated in the
remarkable demonstration.
The arrival of the party was scheduled
for 7:20 at the Van Buren-street depot of
the Rock Island road, but the train was
twenty minutes late, and when it arrived
the streets adjoining and the interior of
the station were jammed with people
patiently waiting for the coming of the
nominee.
As best they could the procession of
organizations, illuminated by a carriage
containing calcium lights, followed
through the principal streets of the down
town districts, the thousands of people
not connected with organizations drop
ping into line with a good-natured mass.
The balconies of the hotels and the win
dows oi buildings on the route of the pro
cession were filled with tne cheering popu
lace.
Led by the band of the First Regiment,
with banners and flags flying, the profes
sion passed through solid lines oi men and
women, who raised their voices lustily
with cries of "Bryan" predominating in
the oppressive air. Between State street
and W a bash avenue on Monroe street
<every inch of space was occupied by those
who wanted to hear as well as see the
.Presidential nominee. The Clifton House,
where Mr. Bryan stayed during the Chi
cago Convention, is situated on Monroe
street between Wabosh avenue and State
street, and this hotel was chosen by Mr.
Bryan for his stopping place while h- re.
Ten thousand people were crowded in this
space, and every window of the Palmer
House opposite, every window of the ad
joinine buildings, and even the uncom
plated elevated railroad loop were taken
possession of by the welcoming ho<t.
Looking out from the balcony of the
Clifton House nothing was to be seen but
a sea of human faces eagerly waiting for
the first sight of the man from Lincoln.
1 1 was nearly an hour and a half from
the time of arrival until the Bryan party
appeared upon a small balcony of the
Clifton House. Mr. Bryan rested a little
while before he showed himself to the
people and when his face was seen there
arose a mighty and long-continued roar of
voices, lasting several minutes. They
were waiting and surging to and fio and
almost righting for the best places, only to
see and hear Mr. Bryan.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan stood alongside
William J. Strong while the latter made
an address of welcome. When Mr. Bryan,
with his wife bjt his side, prepared to
speak there was a repetition of the peaf
eniiig tumult, making it impossible for
him to be heard until he appealed for
silence. Then he said:
Ladies and gentlemen: You can hear if you
will only be still.' I have no language that
will express the emotions that have been ex
cited by the most remarkuble demonstration I
have ever witnessed. In no other country is
such a scene possible. In uo other country
can the people take up a private citizen and
make him their instrument to accomplish
their will. When I see this assemblage to
night, and when I remember what the news
papers in this city say [loud and continued
hissine] I am reminded of what one of our
friends said to me: ''Nobody is on our side ex
cept the people." As 1 look into the faces of
these people and remember that our enemies
call them a menace to free government, I say
who shall save the people from themselves?
1 am pioud to have in this campaign the sup
port of those who are proud to call themselves
the common pirople.
If I was behind the great trusts and combi
nations I know I would no sooner take my
seat than they would demand that I should
use my power to rob the people. [Great ap
plause.] But having rather the support of the
greÂ«t toiling masses, I know when they give
me their ballot they will unite in saying. Do
your duty and we have our reward. These
are the people who want no favors from the
Government; who want equal rights and spe
cial privileges lor none. [Applause.]
I am glad to have the support of these peo
ple, for 1 know they would risk their lives to
save their country and fellow-citizens. I am
simply on my way from my Western home to
the great metropolis of the Nation to accept
the nomination given me in this city a few
weeks ago. lam glad to take to them your
greetings. I can tell them you are their
friend-, and that you will help them to save
themselves from the domination of Kurop^an
bondage under which they have been suffer
ing.
Mr. Bryan quoted from Emerson to illus
trate the enduring foundation of the Na
tion, and closed by saying:
I gratefully accept your greetings, and in
the words of Abraham Lincoln say, "The peo
ple of the South and North are ready te join
with the people of the East in saying that this
Government of the people by the people and
for the people shall not perish from the earth."
I thank you /or your attention.
A white banner with a golden crown of
thorns and a cross illustrative of Mr.
Bryan's famous epigram, and a blue ban
ner with the words "Our Next President
the Boy Orator of the Platte, William J.
Bryan," was presented to Mr. Bryan. A
boy sang a Bryan campaign song from the
baloonv, and after calling in vain for "Sil
trer Dick" Bland, who did not attend the
lemonstration, the thousands slowly dis
peised.
MAKES P LENTY OF SPEECHES.
Tirynn Talk* to All Kind* of People
During the Trip to Chicago.
GRINNELIi. lowa, Aug. B.â Although
;!ie hour when Mr. Bryan departed from
[)es Moines was sufficiently early to quell
nterest and enthusiasm in most people
juite a crowd had gathered at the railway
itation. They cheered as the train drew
nit. A large crowd gathered to see the
Democratic candidate at Colfax, twenty
hree miles from Dcs Moines, which was
cached just before 8 o'clock.
At Altoona, eleven miles from Dcs
Homes, where the first stop was made,
and at Mitcheliviile, a number of people
assembled to see and cheer him. General
J. B. Weaver, who accompanied Mr.
Bryan from Dcs Moines to Newton, pre
sented the nominee to the people of Col
fax, his home. A large gathering assem
bled as Mr. BryÂ» n began to address them.
Unfortunately for the remarks which Mr.
Bryan intended to deliver they were cut
short by the engineer, who pulled the
throttle and started the train according to
schedule. This is what he managed to
say:
Ladies and gentlemen: I am very glad to
greet the people who live at General Weaver's
home. He was a pioneer in this work and was
talking for free silver long before it had come
to the attention of a great many of us. And I
never think of one of these pioneers who
blazes out the way, and think of the abuse
generally heaped upon the pioneer, without
thinking of what somebody said a year or ho
ago, that when one saw a thing he wag called
a fanatic; when a great mauy saw it he be
came an enthusiast; when everybody shw it
he became a hero. [Laughter and great cheer
ing.]
Another big crowd turned out at New
ton, where a Populist conference is being
held to-day. The Newton people were
very full of enthusiasm and succeeded in
getting a brief speech from Mr. Bryan.
He said:
Ladies and gentlemen : lam glad to see you,
and I believe this is Newton. If lam not mis
taken your town bears the name of a man who
is given credit for stating the law of gravita
tion. Some of the laws of financeâ l may say
all the laws of finance â are as certain in their
positions and aÂ« irresistible in their forces as
the law of gravitation. If you throw a stone
in the air, you say it will come down. Why?
Because it Is drawn toward the center of the
earth. The law upon which we base our fight
is as sure as that. If we have a gold standard,
prices will go down. [Great cheering.]
Kellogg also turned out its quota of en
thusiasts. Grinnell gave Bryan a lively
reception. The nominee's train remained
at the station fifteen minutes, and this
gave Mr. Bryan a chance to respond to
the demand for a speech without the ne
cessity for cutting it ahort to tit the
schedule.
10WA CITY, lowa, Aug. B.â The train
bearing Candidate Bryan reached lowa
Ci'.y at 10:30 o'clock. Ti.e railway station
was packed and Mr. Bryan received an en
thusiastic greeting. He made a brief ad
dress. Brooklyn had a large audience and
secured a speech. Mr. Bryan was pre
sented by Major J. H. Tucker, the Rock
Island agent there.
WEST LIBERTY, lowa, Aug. 8.-Most
of the great crowd at lowa City were
gathered at a point on the platform seme
distance from where Mr. Bryan's car
halted. When it was learned that he was
in the rear coach a rush was made in that
direction, and in a minute men, women
and children were struggling and stream
ing in a confused mass. So terrible was the
crush that several children were nearly
suffocated, and during the time Mr, Bryan
was speaking there was a constant shriek
ing and shouting from the frightened
spectators: Said Mr. Bryan:
Ladies and gentlemen: i have known of
lowa City always as a college town, and as I
have lived, ever since I entered college, in a
college town, I appreciate the advantages
which such towns offer. I have also known of
your town because very early in my residence
in Nebraska it was my good fortune to speak
from the same platform with your townsman.
Judge Fairall, and we have maintained our
acquaintance ever since. [Great cheering as
the train started.]
Between lowa City and West Liberty a
stop was made at Lowney, where Mr.
Bryan received more cheers. Five hun
dred people received the nominee here
when the train rolled in at 11:20 a.m. A
stop of twenty minutes was made for din
ner and Mr. Bryan went immediately to
the station dininL'-room.
DAVENPORT, lowa, Aug. B.â During
the time Mr. Bryan was at dinner at Low
ney he was serenaded by the band, and on
his reappearance he responded happily to
cries for a speech.
At Ailsa, where the train halted a min
ute, the hundred people there shouted for
McKinley and Bryan with equal em
phasis.
At Stockton and at Walcott the prepara
tions that had been made to receive the
nominee properly were spoiled by the de
parture of the train before Bryan V where
abouts were discovered. Davenport was
reached at 1 o'clock.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. B.â Magnificent
receptions were given Mr. Bryan at Daven
port, lowa, Rock Island, i 11.," and Moline,
111. These three cities, with their com
bined population of 70,00 C, are situated so
closely together as to be practically one,
and the three speeches Mr. Bryan made in
the trio of towns were delivered in such
rapid succession that the nominee was
almost exhausted when the Moiine speech
was finished.
At the Davenport station fully 4000
people were gathered, pushing, jostling
and crowding in an endeavor to get near
the Bryan train. When Mr. Bryan ap
peared on the rear platform, accompanied
by the members of a local reception com
mittee who had met him at lowa City, a
mighty shout went up, a brass band
played and the 200 members of the Bryan
Club yelled with frantic vehemence. The
train remained at Davenport five minutes
only, but it was a lively five minutes for
Mr. Bryan and his audience. Alter the
cheering had ceased he said :
They say this is a town that believes In
gold; if so I want you to tell the people that
we will do even better, for we beiieve in both
gold and silver. [Cheers.] I promised myself
that I would not do any talking on the road,
but the presence of so many enthusiastic per
sons is a temptation which I am not ablu to
withstand.
I don't know whether I can come back or
not, because it is a large country, ami it is go
ing to take a good while to get over it, but if
the shoutings that I hear there are an indica
tion of your feelings Ido not think it will be
necessary for me to come back here. [Cheers.]
I have promised that I would not muke any
appointment until election is over, but I will
break that promise and appoint each one of
you a missionary to go and work until electiou
day. [Cheers.]
Followed by more speaking the train
drew out from Davenport across the Mis
sissipi into Illinois, the nominee's native
State. Rock Island was ready for him
with a band and a great collection of her
population, male and female. When Mr.
Bryan s speech was concluded the 2000 or
more people in the assÂ«mbia<;e made a
mad rush to shake Mr. Bryan's hand, and
those ~ho could get near enough, but did
not succeed, seemed just as happy to shake
hands with Mrs. Bryan.
A big bunch of roses had been thrust
into Mrs. Bryan's hand, and these she
began to distribute to the pushing, strug
gling enthusiastic crowd. Thi3 caused the
scramble to become wilder and it was in
progress when the train drew out. When
Mr.Bryan had a chance to speak he said :
Ladles and gentlemen: It gives me a great
deal of pleasure to find so many people here
awaiting our return lo the Slate in which we
were both born. I would feel very badly, in
-leed, if in Illinois there should be less cordial
support than in the State where we now live
It gratifies us, therefore, to meet the citizens
ot our former State, and see them manifest the
interest in the result of this election. The
principles represented in the Chicago plat
form will be presented from the stump in every
State in this Union from Maine to California.
[Applause.]
There Is not a State which we are willing to
concede to the enemy, because we believe that
in a great struggle for financial independence
the citizens of all of the States will stand up
for American institutions and American
right*. [Tremendous cheering.] a few days
ago the Democratic candidate for Governor of
this State passed through our city on his way
to the mountains to take a much needed rest
If you will give to the electoral ticket of this
State as large a vote as I know you will give to
your candidate for Governor, John P. Altgeld
[loud cheers], we shall be satisfied. [Cheers
and applause.]
At Moline the local reception committee
conducted Mr. and Mrs. Bryan to a truck
about fifty yards from the train, which
they reached after a hard tussle with the
hundreds of struggling people to get near
to the big figure in the white hat. With
perspiration streaming from his brow, his
collar wilted and his black alpaca coat all
awry, Mr. Bryan made a ehort speech in
tones seemingly more earnest than he had
employed elsewhere during the day. He
said:
I am very much gratified to find those peo
ple assembled in a manufacturing towii, where
so large a proportion of the population are
what are known us laboring men. If our cause
does not benefit those who toil, then we have
no rigbttoaskforitsadoprionby the American
people, because no policy which does not in
the beginning benefit the producers of wealth,
the men who bring permanent prosperity to
the people of this country.
I believe with all my heart that the restore.
tion of the free and unlimited coinage of gold
and silver at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
without wailing for the aid or consent of any
other nation on earth, will be of benefit to all
the common people of the United States.
[Cheers.] And when our opponents corns and
speak to the laboring men and try to warn
tnem against the restoration of silver, I want
the laboring men to submit this question to
them that they let the laboring men them
selves tell what is good for them and not have
others speak for them. [Cheers.] A petition
was filed in Congress a little more than a year
ago signed by the leaders of all the labor
organizations of prominence in the United
States, and that petition, after describing the
evil effects of demonetization, asked for the
restoration'of gold and silver at 16 to 1.
I would be willing to submit this question
to the laboring men themselves, but I am not
willing to submit to those people who say that
free coinage would be good for them, but that
they are not willing to be benefited for fear
the laboring man will suffer. [Applause and
laughter.] All I ask of you is that you study
this question, und when you make up your
minds what ought to be done, go and do it,
remembering that In the United States the bal
lot is given to you for your own use, for your
own protection, and that no man can tell you
how you shall use it. [Applause.]
There were people who cheered at East
Moline, Carbon Cliff and Colona, and
Genesee managed to put a maximum of
enthusiasm into the minimum of time
allowed Mr. Bryan there by the train
schedule. The crowd wanted a speech,
and Mr. Bryan thanked them tor the in
terest manifested, and advised them to
keep it growing until November.
At every small station where the train
stopped crowds of from 50 to 200 were
gathered, and every one wanted to get a
glimpse of Mr. Bryan. Half a dozen old
soldiers were foremost in the deinonst.ru
tration at Bureau, which was very cordial.
The train reached the junction at 3:35
o'clock, and Mr. Bryan gratified his audi
ence by a few remarks.
At Spring Valley an interesting feature
of the reception was the presence of a
number of begrimed coal- miners, with
smoky lamps in their hats. Here one of
the heartiest welcomes Mr. Bryan has re
ceived on his trip was given.
La Salle, a large manufacturing town,
was hysterically enthusiastic in her greet
ing. Mr. Bryan said:
Ladies and gentlemen: I Delieve this is one
of the strong Democratic counties of the State.
[Great applause.] Will you go back on your
record this fail? [Loud cheering and cries of
'â¢No."] 1 want to say to you that I do not
believe that we have ever made In this country
a more thoroughly Democratic platform than
that which was adapted at Chicago at the
Democratic convention. It sets forth the
policies of the Democratic party and I believe
these policies will commend themselves to the
judgment of the great common people. Gen
tlemen, if you in this county will give the
electoral ticket as large a vote as I kuow you
will give your candidate for Governor, John P,
Altgeld [loud applause] we shall be satisfied.
[Great cheeriug.j
The home of Comptroller Eckels, Ottawa,
was hearty in its welcome. More than
1000 people formed tie audience. Mr.
Bryan said:
We are entering upon a campaign in which
it seems that all of the people are going to
take part. Where old leaders have gone back
upon their records and have deserted the
cause In which the people believe new leaders
have come to the front, and it illustrates, I
think, as well as any experience we have had,
the capacity of our people for self-government.
In this campaign there is going to be one
paramount issue, and that is the money ques
tion. The Republican platform declares in
favor of the maintenance of the gold standard
until foreign nations take pity upon our con
dition and comÂ« to our rescue. [Cheers.]
The Democratic platform declares its un
alterable opposition to the gold standard and
declares in favor of the immediate restoration
of the Jree and unlimited coinage of both gold
and silver at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1,
without waiting for the aiu or consent of any
other nation. [Loud cheers.] It is not diffi
cult for you to determine on which to stand.
Remember that the Republicans do not say
that the gold standard is a good thing. The
misery that has cursed every country where it
has been tried proclaims that it is not good
and no party in this country has everdefended
it. The Republican party, without daring to
say that it v good, dares to say that the Amer
ican people must suffer from it until some
other governments will help us to get rid of it.
We appeal to a people capable ot governing
themselves and ask them to say whether they
will determine theii own financial policy for
their own benefit or submit to a policy which
other nations think we ought to endure.
[Cheers.] I am willing to rest the question
there. [Long continued cheering.]
The demonstration at Joliet was one of
the greatest given Bryan since he left
Lincoln. It is estimated that 5000 people
were there, and they were wild to shake
Bryan's hand, recklessly taking chances
on life in the suffocating jam. The scene
approached a panic, and Mr. Bryan finally
refused to shake hands with more people.
Mr. Bryan made a short address, saying
in part: "Our opponents sometimes say
that we do not know what 16 to 1 means;
but I want you to let them understand
that it has one meaning, and that is that
every one silver man is to get sixteen
others to vote with him in November.
[Applause.] That is one meaning of 16 to 1
that they will be interested in learning
during the campaign."
The members of the Chicago reception
committee met Mr. Bryan at Joliet and
accompanied him to Chicago. The run to
Chicago, which was reached at 7:20, was
made without further incident.
THERE IS STRIFE AHEAD.
Opposition to the Adoption of the
Party Name by Gold
Democrats.
Steps Will Be Taken to Prevent In
dependent Candidates From Get
ting on the Ticket
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. B.â A fight
will grow out of the adoption by the gold
Democrats of the name of the old party
organization. Il the convention meeting
in Indianapolis September 2 nominates
an independent ticket, holding to the
party name, as the call for the convention
has done, the Democratic National Com
mittee will take steps to prevent the inde
pendent candidates from getting on the
ticket. '
It is said at Democratic headquarters
that the Indianapolis conference had no
right to adopt the name of the National
Democratic party. The regularity of the
primaries and of the National Democratic
convention held in Chicago was never,
they say, disputed in any way, and there
is absolutely no warrant for a self
constituted committee to make use of the
party name. It is presumed that this is
done to evade the law in certain States,
which will not permit irregular nomina
tions to be placed on the State ticket. If
an attempt is made to put in the field a
set of independent electors, calling them
Democratic electors, an injunction will be
applied for to prevent the use of tbis party
name and a hard fight in the court's of
many States may follow.
The idearof an independent nomination
being made by the gold Democrats is
generally gratifying to the Bryan Demo
crats, but they do not intend to have the
nomination made in the name of the old
party. Their belief is that an independent
party will help Bryan if it amounts to
anything at all, inasmuch as some voters
would probably hove to vote for McKinley
if there was no one but McKinley and
Bryan to choose be.ween.
Jtean Gardner JHea at Omaha.
OMAHA, Nebk., Aug. B.â A dispatch

ENGLAND TAKES
A FIRM STAND,
Withdraws From the Most
Shadowy Concert of
Europe.
NOT TO FOECE CRETANS
This Action Is Recognized as
Adding Considerable to
History.
GERMANS ARE MADE ANGRY.
Various Political Complications and
Intrigues of Nations Reviewed
by Harold Frederic.
LONDON, Exg., Aug. B.â England has
at last done something in the line of what
English-speaking people have been hoping
end praying for these fifteen months. She
has withdrawn unreservedly from the
shadowy concert of Europe, and has re
fused to join others in either forcing the
Cretans to submit to the Turks or blockad
ing the island so as to prevent Greek sym
pathizers from landing arms and supplies
for the rebels.
This action is recognized as adding a
good deal to history. What its immediate
effect will be it would be difficult for the
moment to predict. Germany has been
all along the master spirit in the combina
tion for maintaining the Sultan's position,
no matter at what expense of blood guilti
ness. Hence it is only reasonable now to
find the German reptile press denouncing
England and EngliVn treachery and greed
at the very top of its lungs.
It is not surprising either to learn that
tbe German Foreign Office is passing
through a violent crisis* and that Prince
Hohenlohe is on the eve of a tumble, if he
has not. already fallen. There is, indeed,
an effort on the part of German official
journals to persuade Europe that English
aid should be a matter of indifference;
that Europe is quite able to do what she
wishes without England. But this is re
ceived with suspicious silence. All these
signs point to the conclusion which, I
think, was first anticipated in these dis
patches, that there has been a radical
change in Russia's attitude. Prince
L'obanofT remains in office, and stress is
laid in an official dispatch to-day from St.
Petersburg on the fact that he will accom
pany the Czar on his forthcoming tour of
the political capitals of Europe. But ap
parently the mastery is no longer in his
hands, and indeed he may easily not last
till September. No doubt it was a knowl
edge of this change which rendered Eng
land's nominally independent action
possible.
We get a token that it is comprehended
in Paris as well, where the foreign and
other journals have suddenly been seized
with a great admiration for England's
courage and disinterestedness. What the
practical fruit of this altered situation will
be it would still, as I said, be hard to guess.
Crete grows worse each week. Excited
tales are coming by way of Athens of ter
rible massacres of Christians at Heraklion,
or Candia, as it is more generally called.
For the time being this ancient city,
whither 20,000 Moslem refugees are said to
have fled, is a center of news interest, but
CÂ»nea may usurp the place any day, and,
for that matter, the whole island is ablaze.
There is less success in claiming attention
for the Macedonian revolt, which appears
to be considerably scattered in the skir
mishing, but the Turk, at least, is holding
his own. It is reported, however, that
three tribes of Arnauts or Bashi Bazouks
have been armed by the Turks to guard
the The&salin frontier and their operations
are not likely to arouse general interest.
There are also circumstantial reports of
Turko-Buigarian conflicts on the latter
frontier.
The Sultan's treasury has been closed
out absolutely by this year of disorder, |
and the need of money has become at last j
imperative at Constantinople, if Turkey's ]
nuereat obligations are not to be repudi
ated.
This has led to rumors that England is
thinking of advancing the money to the |
Porte, either by the conversion of the
Crimean loan or otherwise obtaining it in
return for substantial guarantees of decent
government in Crete. It is doubtful, how
ever, whether matters have not gone j
much too lar to make an}- such rosewater
solution possible. To add to the uncer
tainty it is said in Berlin, and apparently
believed, that something will probably
happen or will be invented for a pretext
for a postponement of the Czar's western
tour, since he is really not fit physically
or mentally to undergo a month of travel
and incessant inspection by strange eyes.
Li Hang Chang makes a perfect visitor.
The English have had such extensive
Asiatic experience that they have been
able to avoid the errors into which tne too
eaeer Germans and French naturally fell.
Tney have given Li a big mansion, numer
ous magnificent cnrriaÃes, with servants
in yellow livery, and have left him alone
to do what be likes. He dr.ves a great j
deal. For the rest he pokes about in a
wicker Sedan chair wherever his fancy
leads him, and everywhere meets with
marked courtesy. But there is no desire
to dictate his movements or run him this
way or that. This he appreciates im
mensely and does not mind saying in
public that England is tbe friend China
most of all needs ant would be gladdest
to have. Although be talks a good deal
about bis age, he really has great vitality
and endurance, and can stand heavy pro
longed tasks of sightseeing if the things
shown him are worth while. He has pro
found interest in mechanical novelties,
particularly if related to armament and
also in large engineering works.
He personally intervened to alter the
plan of his northern trip by which he
would have missed a si r htof the Forth
Bridge, and at his instance considerable
time is to be deducted from the merely
social aide of this journey and added to
his inspection of Lord Armstrong's great
gun foundry and such big shipyards as he
is to visit.
The circumstances in which the major
ity of tbe House of Lords flouted and de
feated its own government on Thursday
have given the incident more importance
than it probably deserved. Of the 83
Irish landlords who voted in the major
ity of 125, quite a third are men unknown
in London and who perhaps hardly aver
age one day's parliamentary attendance
in ten years. It is not difficult to credit
tbe story that a number of them bad to be
provided with the means for the journey
to England.
The spectacle of these rude bucolic
squireens gathered in this extraordinary
muster to resist a land bill which bad
satisfied the Tory Ministry was still not
so augring as the practically solid array
of rich nobles who live in "England and
only use their Irish rents as pocket money,
â 11 intent on the same relentless treat
ment of the Irish tenant. It was, in truth,
a revolting exhibition, and one day of it
was enough. On Thursday a good many
non-Irish peers were willing to support
this Irish mutiny on the vague general
ground that the landed people ought to
stand together, but what they saw of its
spirit, which was precisely that of a meet
ing of small shareholders in a doubtful
concern, eager to do any meanness which
would promise an additional half-penny
of dividend, sickened them, and on Friday
they stayed away. Some of the papers are
talking wildly about Ministerial conster
nation and impending resignations.
This is nonsense. Ido not even believe
the land bill will be sacrificed. It is much
more likely that when tne Commons re
turn it to the Lords with their amend
ments mostly cancelled Lord Salisbury
will make a speech for all there is in Jt
and will force the majority to save the
bill. Tbe time is extremely limited, of
course, but I imagine that is what will be
done.
It 13 a rather curious reflection that all
this violent rush to wind up the session by
the 18th at the latest, which has made
necessary a wholesale sacrifice of intended
legislation and rendered this oyerstrong
yet impotent Ministry the laughing stock
of the year, has no objectin the world save
to enable gentlemen of the House not to
miss more than the first week of grouse
shooting.
One of the Irish leaders on Thursday, in
denouncing the proposed extension of
tenants' turbary rights, appealed touch
ingly to this same spirit. "What would
be the emotions of any of your leader
ships," he demanded, "if when you were
engaged with your party in a pheasant
drive a tenant should intrude upon the
scene to cut turf."
While the politicians and journals
which profess republicanism iv Spain all
deprecate disorder, it is apparent that
there is a powerful undertow in the other
direction which gives the authorities at
Madrid much concern. One of the greatest
difficulties confronting the Government is
tbe fact that th c local officials generally
are mere empty, pompous simpletons who
know nothing whatever about what is t>o
ing on under their very noses, and the
minor army officers in charge of the gar
risons are no better. There is a rooted
conviction in Spain that the Cuban rebels
and their sympathizers in Latin America
generally are actively fomenting a revolu
tion in the mother country and are sub
sidizing anarchist and republican con
spiracies.
The French ate taking to heart the un
pleasant showing of their new census
much more than they did five years ago.
Then the republic was in the first throes
of its ecstacy at the prospect of a Russian
alliance, and consoled itself by the
thought that if the French population
did not increase the Russian expanded at
a tremendous rate. But now a good deal
of gilt is off tne gingerbread. Those
multiplying Muscovite hordes by no
means are so definitely under the French
thumb as they were expected to be, and
the Russian alliance itself is openly de
pendent on an unbroken succession of
loans from French savings. These savings
still make France the richest country in
the world, but they also make it a snining
attraction to outside robbers. Germany
has now 14,000,000 more people than
France, and the disparity increases with
tragic certainty yearly.
England has gone crazy this year over
cricket to an extent which seems abnor
mal in even this land of sport. Especially
has the contest with tbe Australian team
aroused extravagant interest, and the rub
ber match on Monday h*a been looked for
ward to by literally millions as the crown
ing event of the year. At tne last moment
there was an awkwa r d hitch, however.
The usual pay of a player in an ordinary
good Â£tame is $50, but since this is to be a
historical great game tome of the best
Englishmen struck for a higher wage, and
as it was refused they are not playing,
with a result, it is feared, that England
will present only a second-rate team to a
bitter national disappointment.
Still another illustrated six-penny
monthly, to be called the Temple Maga
zine, will appear next month. Silas K.
Hocking, who is here something what E.
P. Roe used to be in America, is to be one
of its editors, and the prospectus indicates
that it will make a straight appeal to the
vast middle-ciass public, which loves the
ology in its literature.
A new Tory pix-penny is being organ
ized, with W. H. Mallock as the chief
figure. It is to be the organ of feudal
conservatism which the Saturday Review
has so conspicuously deserted in its revi
vified old a*e.
Justin McCarthy is hard at work on the
third volume of his "History of Our Own
Times," which will take up the thread at
1880 and bring it down to date. Although
a less worldly man than most men, Mc-
Carthy will not deny that he has a certain
pleasure in the thought that this volume
will bring in some money from America,
which the others practically did not.

OPERATIC STARS ALARMED.
Refuse to Sign Contracts for the Next
Season in America Unless Guaran

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 8. â Mile.
Calve, De Reszke, Nordica, Melba and
Eames, and all the great opera singers
popular with lovers of music in New York,
have come ont for gold. From their sum
mer homes on the other side of the ocean
they have watched the fight in this coun
try, .and, fearing' the fate of all artists â
and of every one else who works for
wages â should the silver men win in No
vember, have refused to sign contracts for
next season unless the clause "salaries
payable in gold" is inserted.
Calve, Melba and the rest apparently
feel alarmed about the silver question, for
every one refused to sign the contracts
unless the clause "payable in gold" was
inserted.
Maurice Grau, the operatic impresario

brilliant opera season when greeted by a
representative of the United Press.
His mission abroad had been successful,
and while he had not completed all ar
rangements with the great singers suffi
cient had been accomplished to assure
success. He said he had received an im
mense reception while in Europe, and he
had picked up some new material in the

CONCERT NEEDED
TO SHIELD CRETE
Christians of the Island
Struggle Against the
Turkish Rule.
POWERS MUST PROTEST,
At Least That Is the Consensus
of Opinion Among German
0 ficials.
ENGLAND SCORED BY THE PRESS
Denounced for Her Refusal to Join in
a Joint Naval Blockade of
the Ports.
BERLIN, Gebmany, Aug. 8.-Political
interest during the week has centered in
the insurrection in Crete and the means
to restore tranquillity in that disturbed
island, where the Christians are making a
desperate attempt to throw off the yoke of
Turkish rule, in which they are being
aided by the GreeKs, who desire to see
Crete part of the Grecian dominion. All
sorts of reports regarding massacres and
destruction of villages by tbe Turks and
excesses on the part of the Christian in
habitants are almost daily circulated. But
one thine is certainâ that the situation of
the island is deplorable; and it is the con
sensus of official opinion that something
should be done by tbe powers in concert
to put an end to the present state of
affairs.
The German press, especially the Bis
marckian and conservative organs which
never attempt to conceal their Hostility to
England and all things English, are par
ticularly sore over what was paramount to
tbe refusal of Lord Salisbury, the British
Prime Minister, to join a blockade of Crete
and his alleged championing of Greece and
the Cretans. These papers have been at a
loss to find epithets strong enough to de
nounce Great Britain for her refusal to
join in a joint naval blocade of Crete to
prevent the insurgents obtaining arms and
ammunition and other supplies. German
opinion strongly favored a blockade, but
Great Britain contended that if it were
established it must be directed against
Turkey as well as against Greece, that is,
the warships should be employed to pre
vent the entrance of Turkish troops to re
enforce those already on the island, while
at the same time they prevented the send
ing of Grecian supplies to the insurgents.
It is contended with good reason that
Lord Salisbury well knew the powers
would not agree to this, and consequently
the negotiations for joint action are at a
standstill, and will probably remain so for
some time.
To impartial observers of the situation
it is well known that Great Britain will,
after her experience in the Armenian mat
ter, no longer act as a protector of Turkey,
and thai she will let Russia, which blocked
her plans in regard to Armenia, take all
the responsibility for Turkish misrule. In
official circles here the idea is repudiated
that there is anything in tbe situation that
endangers the peace of Europe, and it is
said that though the prospects are in no
wise clear, matters are in some way tend
ing toward a concert of the powers, a con
cert which, it may be pointed out, how
ever, may be as futile aa the much-talked
of concert anent Armenia, where the dip
lomats found all their plans frustrated by
the diplomacy of Russia. In the mean
time the anarchy which prevails in Crete
demands that some action be taken that
will restore peace to tbe island. But
what that action shall be is difficult to de
cide.
A semi-official statement from St. Peters
burg at length announces with some
deiiniteness the itinerary of the Czar and
the Czarina on their trip to various Euro
pean cities, a trip that has caused no little
conjecture as to its results, as it will be the
first time the Czar has left Russia since
his ascension to the throne. Their Majes
ties will start after the army maneuvers,
which end on August 23, and they will
successively visit Vienna, Berlin, Copen
hagen, Balmoral, Paris and Darmstadt.
At Balmoral they will be the guests of
Queen Victoria, and at Darmstadt, the
Czarina's birthplace, they will visit her
Majesty's brother, Grand Duke Ernest
Louis, and other members of her family.
Prince Lobanoff, the Russian Foreign
Minister, will accompany the party to all
the cities visited, with tne exception of
Copenhagen and Darmstadt, where the
visit of their Majesties will be of a purely
family nature. Much to the delight of
the French Government and Parisians
generally the Czar and Czarina will prob
ably remain in Paris lonser than in any
other city, but the details of their visit
there have not yet been fixed.
There is some anxiety in Government
circles regarding the final decision that
will be arrived at by the Italian Govern
ment anent tne Abyssinian question.
General Baldiserra, the commander of the
Italian forces in Eyrothia, has arrived in
Rome and has had several conferences
with the Minister of War.
This is taken to indicate that it is the
intention to again assume offensive opeia
tions against the Abyssinians, who in the
recent campaign against them inflicted
crushing defeats upon the Italian troops
and practically forced them to abandon
the country and retire to the confines of
the Italian colony. It is reported thai
King Menelik of Abyssinia has received
stores of arms and ammunition and that
he meditates an attack upon the Italians
in October. The eftorts of German diplo
mats will be directed toward preventing
Italy's re-embarking upon a profitless
campaign.
Fritz Friedman, who was formerly the
lawyer of Baron yon Kotze, the court
master of ceremonies, who was impli
cated in the great scandal tnat convulsed
Berlin society for a long time, some time
ago issued a pamphlet on the scandal.
Friedman, who was recently acquitted on
charges of embezzlement, but ordered to
leave the country, was, through his legal
connection with Baron Kotze, in a posi
tion to throw some light on the mysteri
ous letters which formed the basis of the
scandal and which charged all manner of
offenses against members of the highest
circles, not excepting the royal circle
itself. The pampnlet is now declared to
contain matter that constitutes lese
majeste, md its circulation has been pro
hibited.
During his cruise in the northern
waters, Emperor William designed a new
allegorical picture on the Hues of the
"Yellow Peril," which excited so much
comment last year, the meaning of which
is still a mystery. The subject of the
new picture is the defense of art and in
dnstry by the army. Small figures per
sonating the arts and industries stand in
a Gothic recess before which poses an
armtd Teutonic warrior defending them
from menacing ghostly forms which are
outlined in a lowering cloud. Copies of
the picture will shortly be on sale.
The report published a few days ago by
the Vorwaerts, the organ of the Social
ists, that Professor Mendel, a specialist in
mental diseases, had gone to St. Peters
burg in response to a summons from the
imperial family raised much comment.
It was generally thought that the pro
fessor's visit was connected with the Czar
until the Tageblatt, with some show of au
thority, assured the public that the suf
ferer the professor had been summoned to
attend was not an imperial personage, but
a personage of princely rank. Professor
Mendel has returned to Berlin, but he, of
course, is silent as to the object of his
visit.
Heiligendamm, an aristocratic resort on
the shore of the Baltic, is the scene of a
curious legal prosecution. The public
prosecutor, learning that a pigeon shooting
contest was proceeding, sent gendarmes to
ascertain the names of those taking part
in the sport and to serve summons on
them. It has since been learned that one
of the participants, who had given his
name as Count Schwerin, is the grand
Duke of Mecklenburg, in whose Grand
duchy Heiligendaran is situated.

HUNDREDS OF TRAMPS.
An Army of Guards Is Employed by the
Northern Pacific to Rid Its
Trains of Them.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug. B.â Special
Agent Newton of the legal "department of
the Northern Pacific has returned with his
corps of special guards that cleared the
tracks of tramps. The experiment of em
ploying a small army of men to drive off
the vagrants from the Northern Pacific
right of way was a decided success. A
little over a week ago there were from 200
to 300 tramps on the territory of the
Northern Pacific in the wheat lands, while
now there are no more than a batter's dozen
of them.
Hundreds of these men were ejected
from trains during tbe time of the exis
tence of the guard and a number of pretty
hard brushes took place, especially at E Ik
River Junction and Carleton. At these
places the guards had to use their clubs
freely.
At Northtown Junction, beyond Minne
apolis, where the Northern Pacific and
Great Northern cross, the tramps were
especially strong, and sometimes there
would be over 500 men along the right of
way, waiting to board the outbound trains.
But the guards were too many for the tie
counters.
Every car door was locked and every
thing made secure before an attempt was
made to put the trains through. The
trains were guarded with specials, and an
other squad preceded each train through
the yards at the junction and cleared the
right of way. The trains were then
pushed through under a full head of steam
without further trouble. After watching
this sort of thing for six nights the
vagrants straggled over to some other
road.
LI HUNG CHANG COMING,
The State Department Is Expect
ed to Arrange for His
Entertainment.
Speculation With Regard to Defraying
Expenses and the Action of
the President.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Aug. S.-Confir
mation of tbe announcement that Li Hung
Chang would leave Southampton on the
22d inst. for the United States has reached
the Chinese legation here. It is supposed
that the legation has informed the State
Department of the news and that it has
been promptly forwarded to the President
and Secretary of State. Those officials are
now expected to give consideration to the
question of entert*ining the Vice
roy during his stay in the United States.
No details have yet been perfected for
Li's reception, and in fact not much
thought has been given to the matter.
The probabilities are that the Chinese
Minister and his entire suite will go to
New York and there greet the Emperor's
representative upon his arrival. Former
Secretary of State Foster, who is on inti
mate relations with the distinguished
Chinese statesman, will also probably be
on hand to welcome Li to America. Mr.
Foster and Li were warm friends in the
Orient, and the latter has undoubtedly in
formed Mr. Foster of the date of his ar
rival in this country.
The State Department will also probably
have representatives in New York to
formally express this Government's grati
fication at the coming of Li. There will
be Secretary of State Olney and Assistant
Secretary of State Rockhill, the latter be
ing well acquainted with the great Chinese
statesman as a result of a number of
years' residence in Pekin in a diplomatic
capacity.
No positive information can be obtained
as to where the President will receive Li
or the date upon which such reception will
take place. It may be that Li will not see
Mr. Cleveland. If the President were in
Washington it would be an easy matter to
arrange an audience. Being at Gray
Gables, however, it would not be strict
diplomatic etiquet to have Li make a long
journey to the Cleveland summer home.
The probabilities are that if Li sees the
President at all it will be either in New
York, during his stay there, or in Wash
ington. In the event of the latter being the
meeting place, the President will have to
make tbe journey to this city and back to
Gray Gables, something he and his friends
are anxious that he should avoid. It has
not yet been decided whether Li shall be
the guest of the Government or whether
he will defray his own expenses.
It is true that there is no special appro
priation for his entertainment, but if the
authorities desired they could employ the
secret service fund to pay any expenses
that may be incurred during his stay in
the United States. It is pointed out that
the Princess Eulalia was entertained at
Government expense, although there was
no appropriation for that action, the se
cret service fund being employed in this
instance.
Li will have an autograph letter from
the Emperor to present to the President,
and it is this fact that has induced the
belief that Mr. Cleveland will make an
earnest effort to welcome him. It is not
known what this letter contains, but it is
supposed it is the usual formal letter of
greeting from a sovereign to the chief
executive of a republic. It is not known
how long Li will remain in the United
States.

EFFORTS TO MAKE A MARKET.
Interstate Commerce Commissioners
Trying in Vain to Trac9 Ir
regu ar Charges.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. B.â The Interstate
Commerce Commission yesterday re
sumed its investigation of the charges
against Western roads. Mr. Stickney,
president of the Chicago and Great West
ern road, was recalled.
The Commissioners insisted on having
the name of the road or roads which had
made any demand. Stickney will famish
them later.
At the opening of the morning session
the witness, speaking of the high rate
west of Missouri and the low rate on grain
east of the river, said :
"You charge the Kansas and Nebraska
farmer 13 cents to haul his grain 200 miles
and you charge the grain dealer 6 cents to
haul that same grain twice as far to
Chicago. I tell yon it is that kind of busi- I
ness that is making anarchists-"
Mr. Stickney said he had organized the
lowa Development Company to engage in !
the grain business, because it was the only j
way his road could get any business haul
ing grain at a fair price.
On final cross-examination Mr. Stick
ney admitted that he went into the grain
business to make the market, and relied
on other lines cutting the rate to get his ;
profits. Departing from the line of in
quiry, he said :
"Here is the trouble. I have known
this Northwestern country for thirtyfive
years. There has never been a year in
that time that the corn crop was moved
until after the corn was in the hands of
the dealers who had the rate.
"Once the farmer is compelled to sell his
grain, then you fellows cut the rate for the
dealer. Not over 25,000,000 bushels of the
240,000,000 of corn in Kansas tnis year has
been moved before the farmer and small
dealer Las not got the rate. At 11 cents
the corn will move promptly.
"We are moving it, but that is because
we have to go out and buy it. We expect
to carry on our business and enlarge it if
it is not declared to be unlawful."
At the afternoon session the methods of
the Burlington and St. Paul were investi
gated, but nothing important developed.
The Interstate Commerce Commission
finished its work here this afternoon.
President Stickney of tne Great Western
road was strongly scored by Paul Morton
of the Santa Fe railroad, who said that
Mr. Sticfcney's admissions showed that
the Great Western bad acted dishonestly.
Chairman Morrison of the Interstate
Commerce Commission also condemned
the methods of the Great Western. He
said: "We do not know that their in
vestigation is completed. It is probable
that we shall take up the further inves
tigation in the future. There is no inten
tion to use this evidence for the purpose
of criminal prosecution. In fact, we could
not. Some of tne acts are not the mis
demeanors contemplated by law. Other
acts have been committed by tbe men
who testified to their own conduct The
amendment upheld by tbe Supreme Court
practically whitewashes those who testify
to their own infractions of tbe law, so we
have no criminal prosecutions to make.
"So far as the investigation has pro
gressed we feel justified in calling atten
tion to one or two things. One is this
method of shipping from Missouri-river
points. It is a method under which rates
are given that are not available to tbe in
telligence of the ordinary shipper. They
are only available to skilled shippers
whose business has to do with rates. An
other matter which we feel like condemn
ing is the particular method of conduct
ing transportation where a railroad
employs another corporation created
by itself and by which the railroad com
pany is enabled to and does buy grain,
sell grain through its own instrumentality
and, after paying the charges and ex
penses, takes what is left of the earnings
for its transportation charges. This is
said by the newspapers to be shrewd busi
ness. It is shrewd, but it is a clear eva
sion and violation of every provision of
tbe interstate commerce law. We do not
propose to decide this matter until after a
full and impartial hearing, but we think
that this practice will not be sustained by
the commission, and having said this
much we will adjourn the present hearing
until such time as we may name in the
near future."
MILITIA ORDENED HOME.
Had Bayoneted Innocent Citizens on the
Street* of Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Augnst B.â Four
companies of tbe militia doing duty at
the Brown Hoisting Works strike in this
city were ordered home to-day by Mayor
McKisson to prevent a threatened conflict
between citizens and soldiers. The latter
had abused their power by bayoneting
innocent citizens. To-day the merchants
and others living in the section of the
city which the soldiers and police had
been guarding warned the Mayor that they
had armed themselves ior self-protection.
Previous to this the Mayor had ignored
all complaints. To-nijrht only one com
pany of soldiers is left on the ground.

220 MARKET ST.S.fSBJ/"BILL" BURKE
DYING AT UKIAH,
The Career of J. B. Owens'
Slayer Drawing to
a Close.
TRAGEDY OF LONG AGO.
Spurred by Jealousy to Take
the Life of His Wife's
Brother.
NAREOWLY ESCAPED LYNCHING
A Fortune Spent in His Defensi
in the Famous Trial
of 1874
TKIAH, Cal., Aug. B.â J. W. Burke
is dying in his cabin, four miles south
of town, which he has occupied for the
laÂ«t ten or twelve years. Burke is a
pioneer of this county, and his death
would recall to those who were asso
ciated with him in the early seventies a
tragedy in which "Bill." as they affection
ately cahed him, figured, and from the
effects of which he never fully recovered.
Burke married a daughter of "old man"
Owens, who resided ab ut twenty miles
from this place, near what is now known
as Singley's Springs, on the road between
Ukiah and Booneville. After Burke and
his wife had been married about a year
the former developed a very jealous dispo
sition, which was manifested toward all
whom his wife had any dealings or with
whoui she came in contact.
Ond day, in the fall of 1874, Mrs. Burke
expressed a desire to visit her parents at
their home. Borke consented, and J. B.
Owens, a brother of the lady, agreed to
take his sister to her parents. Burke
Lad been drinking more or less during the
day, and in the middle of the afternoon
returned to his home. There he saw
young Owens and his sister sitting on
the porch chaUing, while the various
members of Burkes family, his parents
and sisters and brotnera, were in and about
the house. As he rode up he made some
remark which boded ill for Owens, but the
latter paid no attention to it.
Burke got off his horse, strode onto the
porch and there began abusing Owens.
Owens became frightened at the careless
manner in which Burke handled his shot
gun and started to leave, running up the
county road towards this place. He had
reached Robinson Creek, 150 yards from
the house, when Burke got onto his horse
and followed him. Owens pressed on and
crossed the creek, which was some five feet
deep at its deepest, and probably fifty feet
wide. Just as he emerged on the opposite
bank Burke caught up with him and
placing the barrel of the stiotgun not two
feet from Owens' left temple fired both
barrels, discharging the contents into the
young man's brain. The unfortunate
man lived about six hours.
Burke took to the hills and while there
was furnished with food and supplies by
friends in tne vailey. A posse, led by
"Doc" Standley, at that time Sheriff of this
county, was closÂ« on his trail, and a mem
ber of that posse, a young law student
named Marstella, a clerk in the office of
District Attorney T. L. Carothers, was the
man who captured Burke. He was brought
to town and placed in the County Jail.
Murders had been so frequent and many
had been committed in such wanton cold
bloodedness and with such willful pre
meditation that mob violence was feared.
The officen, received word tha: a mob
was *o attack the jail and tate therefrom
the ei^ht men who were at thht time its
inmates, each awaiting trial for murder.
County Judge T. B. Bond made an order
transferring the prisoners under arrest for
murder to Sonoma County for safekeep
ing, and about midnight one dark ni^ht
the eicnt prisoners, closely guarded, were
loaded into a thorouehbrace and driven to
Santa Rosa.
When Burkes trial came up he was
represented by Hon. R. McGarvey, the
present Superior Judge of this County,
Hon. J. B. Lamar and Hon. is. Greene
Curtis of Sacramento. The latter made
the defense in this case the effort of his
life, and so great was the strain upon him
that at the close of the trial he was speech
less from exhaustion. It is said that Cur
tis tried but one case after this one, that
being the case of the People vs. Laura D.
Fair, wherein he defended that lady on
her second trial for murder.
Burkes attorneys moved for achanee of
venue on account of the bias and preju
dice of tiie community, and this was
granted. The case was sent to Sonoma
County and tried before rion. W. C. Wal
lace, at that time District Judge for the
Ninth Judicial District. The prosecution
was conducted by Hon. T. L.
Carothers, at that time District Attorney
of Mendocino County, assisted by Hon.
Barclay Henley, District Attorney of So
noma County. The trial occupied a week,
and every point was bitterly contested!
When the case had been submitted the
jury was not long in bringing m a verdict,
tindiug the defendant guilty of murder in
the first degree, with a recommendation
that he be incarcerated in the peniten
tiary for life.
The main witness on behalf of the peo
ple was an old Indian, by name Suisas,
who sat on the bank of the creek and saw
Ihe .whole proceeding â the pursuit of
Owens by BurKe and the shooting.
Burke was sent to San Quentin for life
but owing to the fact that he met with an
accident whereoy his foot was crushed, his
term was commuted by Governor William
Irwin to ten years, and, with his credits
which he had earned, Burke was soon a
free man. He returned to his place here,
only to find that during his incarceration
his wife had secured a divorce from him
and left the country. Shortly after Burke
married a daughter of D. Ervin of this
ÂplÂ«ce, arid they have a child.
\ At the time of the killing Burke was re
puted to be worth in the neighborhood of
?15,000 or $20,000, but the expense of his
trial was so great and the mon*-y neces
sary to secure his release from State prison
so enormous that he is practically penni
less. His cabin is within a short distance
of the place where the shooting of Owens
took place. Owens at the time of his death
was a young man about 25 years of age. A
widow and one child survived him. His
widow subsequently married Isaac Cris
pin, a rancher of Manchester, in this
county, and his daughter is a school
teacher near this place.

NEVADA CITY EXPLOSION
Two Men Maimed in a Disaster
at the Live Yankee
Mine.
Giant Cartridges Ignited by a Spark
From a Fuse They Were
Testing.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., Aug. B.â An ex
plosion that came near costing John Dur
bin and Al O'Donnell their lives occurred
this morning at the Summit, or Live
Yankee mine, about a mile south of this I
city. Durbin, who is a miner, came up to
tne surface to get some fuse and giant
powder caps. O'Donnell, an engineer,
went with him to the powder-house, prob
ably thirty feet from the hoisting works.
Durbin obtained a box of cartridges and
while holding them in his hand started to
test a piece of fuse.
A spark from the fuse fell into the box
of cartiidges, causing a tremendous ex
plosion. Both, men were knocked down
and terribly cut by the flying pieces of
copper from the caps. Dnrbin's right eye i
was injured, and at first it was believed
that it had been blown out.
It is now believed that the sight has not
been destroyed. His right hand was
shattered and he received serious injuries
in the abdomen.
As soon as the men recovered from the
first shock Durbin ran from the building
to a ditch near by, into which he fell.
O'Donnell's right hand and arm were
badly torn and he sustained serious in
juries in the groin. In spite of his dis
abled condition he followed Durbin and
dragged him from the water into which
he bad fallen.
Then O'Donnell lowered the cage and
hoisted the miners to the surface, telling
them to care for Durbin while be tele- |
graphed the news of the accioent to
Superintendent Nihell. The telep one
and the wall surrounding it were spat
tered with his blood. After sending the j
message he dropped to the floor ex
hausted.
Dr. Tickell was soon at the mine and
gave the injured men the necessary at- j
tention. As both are young arid vigorous j
it is the physician's opinion that they will j
recover. Durbin was taken to his home I
at Grass Valley and O'Donnell was
brought to this city.
Within two feet of where the explosion j
occurred was a full box of giant powder,
but it was not exploded by the concus
sion.

Wounded by Andrew Mills.
MODESTO, Cal., Aug. 8. â William
Young, a farmer, and Andrew Mills, the
latter an employe of Young's father-in
law, S. S. Baker, fought on a main street
of the town this afternoon. During the
fracas "Young's right leg was shattered
above the knee by a bnllet from Mills' re
volver.
A fine horse driven by Mills had died
and the trouble between Young and Mills
grew out of its treatment. Their quarrel
was renewed to-day and Young, who is a
large man, rushd at Mills, a small man.
They fell together, but Mills drew a re
volver in falling: and fired. Young got
hold of the weapon and prevented a sec
ond shot.

tated. The bone is shattered and the bul
let has not yet been extracted. Mills is in

Student Kaufman and His
Bicycle Carried Away
by Outlaws.

Unfrequented Locality and
Released.
TIEES OF HIS WHEEL CUT.

Alarm.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., Aug.
8. â A remarkable highway robbery, com
mitted here on the campus a few nights
ago, has just come to light. Two men in
a buggy stopped, captured and carried off
at the point of a pistol one of the best
known students in the senior class,
Adolph G. Kaufman of Tacoma, Wash
The night was dark. Kaufman was re
turning on a bicycle from a late ride,
when, wheeling along cautiously in the
darkest part of the thickly shaded avenue
just back of the women's gymnasium, he
met a carriage. The driver called to him
to "hold on a minute," and the cyclist,
thinking it was only another of the many
cases of confusion resulting from igno
rance of the direction of the winding
driveways on the extensive campus,
jumped from his wheel and stopped near
the horse. One of the men got out of the
buggy, remaiking as he did so that he
was "all turned around in these drive
ways." He approached Kaufman and
thrust a pistol under his nose.
"Hump that wheel into the bnggy and
pile in yourself," he muttered.
Kaufman attempted to treat it as a joke,
believing that some of the fellows had put
up a hoax on him. But he was soon con
vinced that it was a serious matter when
he felt the muzzle of the pistol touch his
lips and heard a viie direction from the
man in the buggy. He did as he was or
dered.
Seated between the two men he was
driven by a back road westward in the di
rection of Redwood City. They went
through Kaufman's pockets and took $61,
I the student having recently received quite
a sum of money to pay his board bill and
square up his summer school expenses be
fore starting for home. Fortunately he
bad paid his bills that day.
At each attempted remonstrance he
was told to keep his mouth shut, nor
would they allow him to talk. Finally,
when about five miles from the university,
they stopped on a lonely stretch of road
from which there were no farmhouses in
sight, and told Kaufman to get out. He
realized then that they meant to leave
I him, and he pleaded earnestly for the bi
! cycle, which he had borrowed from a
friend. So anxious was he to get back the
wheel that he promised faithfully that he
would ride directly home and not make
an attempt to have them apprehended.
j After a little parley in an undertone with
the driver the other man got out, lifted
out the bicycle and with his pocket-knife
cut almost ttirougn the hind tire. The
two then drove rapidly away in the direc
tion of San Francisco. â¢
Kaufman arrived on the campus after
midnight, trundling his wheel. In apolo
gizing for the condition of the tire and
his inability to pay for another at that
time he confided the story to that friend
and subsequently to one other, admonish
ing both to strict secrecy.
Kaufman fears the college joshers and
the junior annual. Each year of the four
that he 1 as spent here he has been a shin
ing mark lor illustrated witticisms pub
lished in the "Quad." He preferred to
keep this experience a secret rather than
be twitted about it when he returns with
the other students next month for the
opening of the fall term.
He is a musician of really extraordinary
ability and remarkable versatility. It was
he who organized and trained the Stan
ford band of lorty pieces, the excellent
playing of which was a feature of two of
the great Thanksgiving day football games
in San Francisco. He can play any musi
cal instrument from a Jewsharp to a
piano, but his specialty is the slide trom
bone. Kaufman has composed a Stanford
march, senior, junior, sophomore ami
freshman marches and other music. Sev
eral of his pieces have been played repeat
edly by the park band and by the Colum
bia Theater orchestra in San Francisco.

If you should look into the great receiving-rooms of the EMPORIUM now it
would be hard to convince you that there was any such thing as "dull times." The
vanguard of the largest Fall stocks ever bought for this city have already arrived,
and our receiving clerks and packers are having a very busy time of it.
The EMPORIUM leads the procession. WE make the First Showing of novel-
ties for Fall that is made in this city. A month earlier than you are accustomed to
being served. The EMPORlUMâ leaders in style, priceâ leaders in every way.
AbOUt Eall There has been no
n~~^,s c* tt haphazard buying for
UreSS MuttS. the great Dress Goods
sections of the World^ Grandest Store.
An expert has made the selections of fab-
rics for the fall trade after an exhaustive
study of the fashion forecasts. Only the
very choicest styles were accepted from
the manufacturers, and the influence of
"spot cash" was brought to bear in re-
ducing cost. The EMPORIUM will lead
this fall in styles and prices.
See the preliminary displays, which in-
clude the following new weaves :
Gauffre TwTone. 'â¢ Frieze Jacquard.
Fantasie c Ãoucle. Uroche Velours.
Tersian Broche. Broche Monotone.
Jacquard a Louis XIV. Nouveaute a Jour.
Matelasse d 1 Orient. Drap de Moutonet.
Tete a Negre. Satin Princess.

CLOSING DAY OF
PETALUMA'S FAIR
A Week of Excellent Sport
and General Enjoy

a Sensation by Making a
Runaway Win.

Summaries of Results in the Varions
Events That Concluded the Fun'
at the Track.
PETALUMA, Cal., Aug. B.â The clos
ing day of tho fair was a great success.
The weather was , warm, and the town
girl was out ; in her prettiest summer
gown, making the grounds a sea of pretty'
faces and gay colors.
After disposing- of his [wagon-load of
produce, the farmer journeyed to the
track, where the attendance was all that
could be desired. . The different sure
thing games raked in ail the dollar* that
came their way, and the gambling frater
nity, undoubtedly, enjoyed the most
profitable day of the wee it. .
The sport was excellent and regret was
expressed among the late comers that an
other day of equine contests was not forth
! coming. The management throughout
has been splendid, and the Sonoma and
Marin Agricultural Association is to be
complimented on the ability it has dis
played.
The track to-day was in fine shape, but
the winning horses. in the different events
decided shattered no records. The one
big surprise was the win of Nevere, a 20 to
1 shot, in the mile-and-a-f urlong - handi
cap. Ridden by a mite ot a lad named
Jimmie Woods the horse dropped in with
70 pounds and made a runaway run of it,
winning by a city block: in the fast time
of 1:54. .
The 2:17 pace "was taken by Frank L
(who sold in the field) in straight heats,
and Visalia disposed of Toggles and
Native State very handily in the free-for
al trot. â¢ â T _ ".
Bicyclist Oscar Osen and W. Wood, the
crack pacer, were expected to give a fast
exhibition of speed in their special race,
but it proved a big disappointment. '
The horse was backed down to favorit
ism before the first heat, and took it; jog
ping in 2:26, owing to an accident to
Osen's wheel. In the second heat Osen
blew up, after closeJy trailing Wood's
running mate to the half, and - Chaboya
sent his horse past the wire in 2:11. â '*::
The gallopers were called first. Eight
started in the handicap, with Fred Gard
ner a pronounced 7 to 10 choice, Two
Cheer and Warraao both at threes, Sea
Spray at 5 and Broad Billow at 6. All
came in for support. Backed from 20
down to 4 Nevere made all ot the running
and won by eight lengths. : :'â 
Warrago finished ahead of Broad Billow
for the place. The favorite was interfered
with at the first turn.Tgggl
Lizette Rose went for a mark, putting in
two heats in 2:32, 2:321^. '
The talent went slightly astray in the
opening pooling on the 2:17 pace.
1 Our Boy at first had the call, bringing
$10, the field $8 and Sam H $7. Promise
Me, the favorite in the book for the first
heat, broke, and Frank L, who came \out
for the first time with a silver -tube in
serted in bis . neck, driven by Ben Cha
boya, took the lead and also the heat very
dexterously in 2:18^. with Sam H second.
The betting now shifted, Frank L fetch
ing $10, Sam H $8Â« and the field $4. The
next heat . was a repetition of the first,
Frank taking the heat as he liked in
2:15%. Selling now for $20 against $8 for
the whole field Frank, who trailed the' !
field until three furlongs from the wire,
passed each of the four other starters in
succession and placed the heat and race to
his credit in 2:14%. : 'â 
Promise Me, who, like the winner, is
also a whistle-necked horse, was second in
this heat.
But three of the free-for-a!leis responded :
to the bell- tap for a $200 purse. Toggles !
at first had the call in tne betting, which,
after one or two pools, changed in favor of
Visalia, who brought $15, Toggles $10 and
Native State $3.. : . ~. , .. , -c <
Perkins had the handsome Visalia ; in
grand condition, and, although â  Toggles
made him step along in the first two heats,
the favorite took the coin in straight heats.
Best time, 2:15%.
A special train will be run to Willows in
the morning, and the majority *of the
trotters and runners are being got in readi
ness to-night for shipment. Summaries:

MEDFORD, Mass., Aug. B.â At Combin
ation Park to-day Star Pointer (2:o4}Â£)
and Joe Patchen (2:04), two of the fastest
performers on the turf, came together in a
special contest. There were 7000 people
present. Besides the star card there were
two other special races which proved to be
two of the cleverest exhibitions seen 'â . in
many days. Joe - Patchen". and Star
Pointer paced steadily till near the half
when Star Pointer made a bad break.
When he recovered himself McCalry
found himself ten lengths behind j Curry,
who was driving a great winning race.
The quarter was passed at 2:09 slip, the
half in 1:04}.;. After passing the half
Curry let ud and allowed McCalry to draw
up so as to be within 'the flag. The time
of the first heat was 2:13%. â  v â¢
In the second heat .Patchen took. the
lead at the word and held it throughout,
covering the half in I:O4 J^ and the mile in
2: 08%. The flag fell sligntly in advance of
Star Pointer. Patchen .and I Curry were
the recipients of tremendous applause.
Later Joe Patchen gave an exhibition
mile paced by the running horse Joe Cot
ton, and made the wonderful time for a
half-mile track of 2:os}Â£- â¢ - The quarter
was done in :31$Â£ and the half in 1:02. c -<
The special trotting race' for a : $1000
purse was won in three straight heats by
Cephas, who in the last heat equaled his
record of 2:11 J^, and also won the world's
record over a half-mile track.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. B.â The plunge
of Sphinxette, by which she won the race,
was the feature of the 2:12 pace which was.
the last event of the grand circuit races, '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
HIS DEMISE IS
STOCKTON'S LOSS,
L. U. Shippee Passes Away
After a Lingering
Illness.
WORRY SPEEDS THE END
All but a Small Portion of His
Immense Fortune Lost in
Late Years.
HIS WOBK FOR THE CITY.
Was the Founder of Many Enter
prises and a Laborer for the
Public Weal.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. B.â L. U. Ship
pee, one of Stockton's most prominent
citizens, died in his rooms in the McKee
building in this city at 3 o'clock this after
noon, after a lingering illness. Some
weeks ago he suffered an attack of in
flammatory rheumatism. The disease and
the worry consequent to the heavy finan
cial losses he has sustained during the
past few years brought on nervous prostra
tion, which hastened his death.
For many years Shippee was one of the
wealthiest men in the San Joaqnin Valley,
as well as one of the most influential. He
was born about ten miles from Providence,
R. 1., in a place which is to this day known
as Shippee's Hollow. He started out early
in life to shift for himself, and when only
12 years of age he hired out to a larmer to
do chores at $5 a month. For seven
months, the term of his engagement, he
worked about the farm, and returned
home the proud possessor of $35. That
rfas his start in life, and with it he massed
a great lortune. While still very young
he learned the machinist's trade, and was
employed at it for several years. This
was always distasteful to him, and so he
farmed one of the places belonging to his
father, and in this way saved up enough
money to come to California.
Early in 1856 he went to New York and
took passage on the old steamer Illinois
for Panama. From the isthmus he made
the voyage to San Francisco in the steamer
Sonora, and arrived there in March. He
at once started for the mines in Tuolumne
County, but he found the diggings pretty
well/ taken up and developed and resolved
to return to San Francisco. On his way
back he was induced by an acquaintance
to stop for a time in this city, and was so
well pleased with its prospects that he re
solved to Btay here. At the time he was
possessed of about $1500, and with that
sum he engaged in business in Stockton.
His first venture was a failure, and he
then secured employment as a clerk with
Schofield & Houcbe, which firm was sub
sequently succeeded by Owen <fc McKee.
Shippee's keen business mind soon made
itself felt, and it was not long before the
business was under the name of Shippee &
McKee.
For eleven years he was at the head of
this firm, and before he severed his con
nection with it it was doing a business of
$275,000 a year. It dealt in livestock and
lands, dealing largely in sheep, having /is
many as 52,000 in 1877 in Tulare, Merced
and Fresno counties. Shippee's landed
interest grew to great proportions, and he
was one of the largest landholders in the
valley up to a short time ago.
None of the great importers or breeders
have ever done more" to improve the
standard of livestock in this State than
did Shippee. For years he was one of the
foremost breeders of fine horses in Cal
ifornia, and as a director of the State
Agricultural Society and of the San
Joaquin Valley Agricultural Association
did much to aid racing in this State.
Shippee was one of the founders of the
Stockton Savings and Loan Society, one
of the strongest financial institutions in
the interior. He was also founder of the
Stockton Combined Harvester and Agri
cultural Works, which are still known as
the Shippee works. He was likewise a
prime mover in the starting of the big
Stanislaus canal scheme. In 1887 Bhippee
was elected Mayor of Stockton, and held
the office for one term. He bad previously
been a member of the City Council. Dur
ing the two years he was at the head of
the city government more permanent
street improvements were made than dur
ing the entire previous history of the city.
For twenty years Shippee was a director
of the State Agricultural Society, and for
two years was its president. For an even
longer period he was a hard-working mem
ber and the president of the San Joaquin
County Agricultural Association. The
big pavilion on San Joaquin street, in this
city, was built largely through his efforts.
During the past few years Shippee has
slowly* but surely lost his fortune. His
large horseracing enterprises drained his
purse, and piece by piece his many farms
were mortgaged to keep his schemes
going. Land values fell, and one by one
bis fine ranches went to the bank he had
helped to found. Ten years ago be was
reputed to be worth more thau $1,000,000,
but to-day it is doubtful if his estate will
bring more than a few thousand dollars.
At the time of bis death he still held a
number of valuable ranches, but they are
all mortgaged for what they are worth.
EXEMPIS\ WILL PARADE.
Veteran firemen to Participate in Ad
mission Day Pestirities.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. B. âThe Exempt
Fire Company of Stockton met last night
to perfect arrangements for taking part in
the Admission day celebration. This or
ganization is a very strong one here, and
includes among its members many old
time and influential citizens. It was dc
ci ded to secure at once a set of uniforms.
They are to consist of red nhirts, with
white buttons and the letter "E" across
the bosom of the shirt, black trousers and
regulation firemen's bats.
Arrangements were also made to secure
an old-time hand engine to haul in the
parade.
Invitations were extended to the Ex
empt Firemen of San Francisco, Oakland
and Alameda to come here on the 9th of
September and participate in the parade.
There will probably be several hundred
firemen in line. Great preparations will
be made by the local men to entertain the
visiting firemen.
SEATTLE REPUBLICAN RAZZI.

SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. B.â The first

PRIMARY FIGHT
AT SACRAMENTO,
"Boss" Daroux Retains His
Hold in the Second
Ward.
RIOTS AT THE POLLS.
Crowds Charge the Police and a
Chinese Bomb Starts a
Panic.
BATONS SWUNG WITH VIGOR.
The Result May Decide Republican
County Nominationsâ A Shoot
ing Affray.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. B.â Frank
Daroux, "boss" of the Second Ward, with
all the political powers "that be," from
one end of the city limits to the other
banded against him, without one solitary
representative on the election board to
preserve his interests, came out of the Re
publican primary with a margin of seven
vote* to the good, and everybody unites in
declaring that he put up one of the best
fights ever seen in this city. Frank Daroux
is nominally a victor, but whether he will
succeed in seating his delegation in the
county convention is a question. After
the votes were counted it was found that
there were forty-two ballots in the
box of which the clerks possessed
no tally, aud in consequence there
will be a protest filed, and it is more than
probable that should the matter be re
ferred to the County Committee to decide
Daroux will be turned down. Even should
he carry the question before the conven
tion he will probably meet even more de
cided opposition, as that body will be
dominated by his opponents, even should
it be deemed advisable in the interests of
harmony to seat tho victors of to-day's
hard fight.
Frank Rhodes and the "farmer," as
Bart Cavannaugh delights in designating
himself, will still hold the upper hand,
controlling every ward in the city except
the Second. If Daroux put up a great
fight, Cavannaugh out up a greater one,
the former being on his own stamping
grounds ana the latter walking in an al
most entire stranger to the shades and
shadows of the Second Ward, and suffer
ing defeat by but seven votes. But he
had the "push" of the city with him.
They had expected a walkover, and are
correspondingly sore and are shouting
murder.
The polls opened at 2 o'clock sharp.
Long before that hour both factions

MARKET AND TAYLOR STS.
gathered there ia force. Shortly after
ward the Cavannaueh faction received
a tip that the wily boas of the
Second intended to oust the election
board appointed by the county commit
tee, and replace it with men of his own
selection. Acting on this they guarded
the entrance to the building en masse.
The opposition made an attempt to dis
lodge them, and war began.
The railing to the stairway was torn
down, the windows were smashed, and
the iron bars guarding them were torn
from their fastenings. There was every
indication of a first-class riot under way
when a squad of police, under the leader
ship of Captain of Police Ash, arrived,
and after not a little breaking of heads re
stored a semblance of order.
When the window of the polling place
was thrown open, Daroux stepped to the
front and demanded that he be allowed at
least one representative in the interior of
the room. This was refused and another
squabble ensued. At last it was agreed
that a police officer would be allowed to
enter. Officer Talbot was selected and
after a stout opposition rally on both
sides was hoisted in through the window.
Then the voting commenced, with the
usual amount of hustling and occasional
fistic encounters, which were promptly
checked by the police.
Shortly after 4 o'clock a Chinese bomb
was exploded in the middle of the mass of
numanity crowded around the polls, and
a scene of the wildest excitement ensued.
The mass of interested lookers-on took
to instant flight, dodging into convenient
doorways and seeking shelter behind
wagons or any object which would protect
them from the shower of lead which they
expected would follow.
In the beisht of the panic, a flying
wedge of Daronx adherents was sent
against the -platoon of police, with the
supposed object of sweeping them aside
and forcing a pathway for two of the
Daronx faction into the polling-place.
If this was the object it failed, as the
officers drew their clubs and rained a
shower of blows on the head of the
"push." Men fell like bullocks and the
rush was stopped.
Then individual fights -were started on
the outskirts of the crowd in the hope of
drawing a portion of the police force from
the immediate vicinity of the polls.
Tliis also failed, as the little squad of
police bad discovered that it had its work
cut out for it at the Dolls.
As the hour of closing drew near George
Rider, committeeman from the First
Ward, made his appearance and de
manded, on behalf of his confrere (Dar
oux), representation at the count.
Then another riot ensued. Rider was
dragged from the platform, but shortly
demonstrated to the "push" that t>e was
something of a scrapper himself. But
they kept pouring at him from all sides,
until Officers Nagle and Fisher went to bis
assistance ana by free use of their clubs
succeeded in rescuing him from his
opponents.
He immediately returned to the polls
and reiterated his demands, which were
at last acceded to, and James Gegen of
San Francisco, who for the nonce has
transferred his residence to the Second
Ward of this city, was sent in through
the window â and the day'a battle was
ended.
The seating of the Daroux faction in
the convention would play an important
part in the selecting of candidates for sev
eral of the local offices. For instance,
should they win J. B. Devine and A. P.
Catlin would be nominated for Superior
Judges. On the other hand Charles Oat
man and E. C. Hart would probably win.
Judge Post, while not a slated candi
date, seems by his large circle of personal
adherents among the majority of the
selected delegates to have a sure call on
one of the three juageships.
In the Second Supervisoral District
Daroux's victory would probably mean
the renomination of J. W. Todd of the
Board of Supervisors, as Todd would
have the twenty-three vo*es of Daroux
REORGANIZED UNDER-

ing a fracas.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. B.â At an
early hour this morning there was a
lively row in Ed Smith's saloon on Fourth
street, during which several shots were
fired and William Fouse had a narrow es
cape from death.
The row originated in election troubles,
and was in a measure precipitated by
Frank Daroux, "boss" of the Second
Ward, who, on entering the saloon in
company with a man known in police
circles by the cognomen of the "Missouri
Kid," made some derogatory remarks
about John Ashe Sheehan, one of the
editors and proprietors of the Sunday
News.
These remarks aroused the indignation
of George McMillen, a reporter for the
News, who resented them by promptly
mixing with Daroux. The "Missouri
Kid," or "Kid" Johnson dashed to the
rescue of his friend, but was stopped by
William Alyord and Ben Shields.
Johnson is a pun-fighter, and gained
notoriety by filling Joe Welsh full of lead
a few months ago in a saloon row in this
city. To-day he was equally quick with
his revolver.
He sprang back, drew his weapon and
fired three shots into the crowd, none of
which took effect, however. He then
turned and placed the muzzle of his re
volver against the stomach of Fouse, one
of the combatants, but before he could
pull the trigger Daroux knocked up his
hand and the ball passed through Fouse's
hat, plowing a furrow tnrough his hair.
When the shooting commenced the
crowd made a rush for the door, and by
the time the last bhot was fired tne room
was cleared. It is more than probable
that this incident resulted In an order
that all the "push" should go unarmed to
the polls to-day, and that bloodshed was
consequently averted.

SAN JOSE, Cat,., Aug. B.â Mrs. Clara
Hatch of ColvilJe, Wash., who came to
this city a few days ago in search of a
long-lost mother, Mrs. Ann Byers, was
last evening reunited with her brother,
Frank Byers, whom she has not seen for
thirty years. In 1866 the elder Byera and
his wife separated, the husband taking
their daughter, now Mrs. Hatch, and
going to Washington Territory. Mrs.
Byers kept the only son, a boy of six
years.
Mrs. Bvers died shortly after the sepa
ration from her husband and the boy
was raised by a family named Sellers. He
took his foster-parents' name and was
known as Frank Sellers. Mr. Sellers now
lives at Ripon, Ban Joaquin County, and
his sister will accompany him to his home
before returning to Washington. Sellers'
whereabouts was learned through old
friends of the family at Santa Clara, and
last evening he came to this city to meet
his sister.

IS WINTHROP THE
GUILTY PERSON ?
Some Facts That Weaken
Capitalist Campbell's
'Story.
AT HOME MONDAY NIGHT
The Accused Seen by His
Wife, His Landlady and Her
Daughter.
EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY
Tale of Two Mutilated Newspapers
and What Their Partial De
struction Meant.
More than three days have elapsed since
James A. Campbell, the Hawaiian million
aire, staggered into the lobby of the Occi
dental Hotel, feebly made his way to his
apartments and to tne arms of his almost
distracted wife, and there, in explanation
of his two days' absence, related a tale
which has set this City by the ears.
Never in the history of San Francisco
had occurred such an act of bold brigand
age as that told of by Mr. Campbell.
The scene of his story might well have
been laid in Greece, and his assailants have
been the picturesque outlaws of its wild
mountains. Not even Dumas' tale of the
adventures of Monte Cristo outrivals the
startling narration of the sugar planter.
Three days and three nights have glided
into the past since Mr. Campbell returned
to the bosom of His family and unfolded
to the sympathizing police his tale of woe.
During those three days the entire avail
able detective force of the City has been
trying to find the man alleged to have
perpetrated the gross outrage.
From the very heart of this City of
300, 000 people that man is said to have in
veigled James A. Campbell to a lonely
houFa in a surburban district and there
subjected him to torture. He is said to
have traversed with his intended victim
several crowded streets of the City and to
have taken a long trip on a streetcar, leav
ing, no doubt, a plain trail behind him,
and yet he is at large.
The police say they know the cool vil
lain. Thej' say he is a man who has once
been in their hands on a charge of murder,
from paying the penalty of which crime
he escaped because of a lukewarm jury.
They say his name is Oliver W. Winthrop
and that they have not captured him.
The police also assert that Winthrop
left the Occidental Hotel, on Montgomery
and Bush streets, about 4 o'clock, and
that tbe brigand and his victim pro
j ceeded by a somewhat circuitous route to
4109 California street, near Third avenue.
That trip cannot be made in less than fifty
minutes.
Oliver W. Winthrop lived at 354 GrovÂ«
street, near Octavia, and three witnesse Ã
will swear that he was at home between
5:30 and 6 o'clock last Monday evening,
when the police say, and Mr. Campbell
back<* up their statement, that he was at
4109 California street.
Campbell says that Winthrop never once
left his presence for more than a few min
utes during over twelve hours follow
ing their meeting on Monday afternoon.
Granting that Campbell was mistaken,
Wintbrop could not "reach his home from
4109 California street in less tnan an hour.
That Wintbrop was at 354 Grove street
between 5:30 and 5:45 on Monday after
noon is asserted by his wife, by Mrs.
I Sopbie Schadde and by Miss "Emma
Schadde. Mrs. Schadde is tbe owner of
tbe Grove-street house and occupies the
lower floor. Her family consists of three
sons and one daughter. The Winthrops
live upstairs.
O. W. Wintbrop is a member of the
American Protective Association and has
been trying to induce the three sons of
Mrs. Schadde to join that organization.
They had put him off several times and
the matter was on Monday last still in
abeyance.
On that evening, between 5:30 and 5:45,
as Mrs. Schadde was preparing dinner,
Winthrop, so she says, came down the
stairs and, opening the kitchen door,
asked her il her sons were at home. She
answered in the negative, and Winthrop
went back upstairs. Miss Emma Schadde
was in the kitchen with her mother, and
also saw Winthrop.
Both ar,e positive that this meeting oc
curred on Monday evening, because on
that evening one of the brothers, who is a
plumber, did not get home until quite
late, having been detained by a job which
kept him until after 9 o'clock.
There is further evidence that Winthrop
was not at the California-street house on
Monday evening. A member of the A.
P. A. lodge, of which Winthrop was pre
siding officer, says that he was positively
present at a meeting of that lodjreon Mon
day evening. Other members of the lodge
corroborate this.
Mrs. Winthrop. when seen yesterday,
refused to be interviewed, but said she has
absolute faith in her husband's innocence,
but acting under instructions of a friend
of the family, C. W. Kyle, she refuses to
tell any one anything she knows of her
husband's movements from Monday up to
the present time.
The Schnddes say that the last time
they saw Winthrop was on Monday even
ing after 5:30, as has been related. They
also tell another story, which would in
dicate that Mrs. Winthrop is fully cog
nizant of her husband's present where
abouts, and that she knows all about bis
connection with the Campbell affair.
The house at 354 Grove street is an old
fashioned edifice, which stands well back
in the yard.
The front fence is overgrown by an
evergreen hedge and there is a little, old
time portico before the door, Mrs. Sophie
Schadde owns the house. Three months
ago Oliver W. Winthrop rented the upper
floor from Mrs. Schadde, and with bis
family, consisting of his wife and two
small sons, moved there from 2612)4 Sut
ter street.
Mrs. Winthrop Is the daughter of W. P.
Brooks of 1108 Steiner street. It was her
brother, F. W. Brooks, who one day last
week left town, leaving a number of jani
tors at tbe Emporium building with a
month's wages due them. It is this cir
cumstance regarding the brother that
fastens on Mrs. Winthrop a suspicion,
amounting almost to certainty, that she
is and was acquainted with her husband's
peculiar movements.
Both the Winthrops and Mrs. Schadde
are subscribers to The Call. The papers
are left together on the portico each morn
ing.
The day F. W. Brooks' escapade became
public, the paper of the landlady was
found in a mutilated condition when Mrs.
Schadde brought it into the house. An
entire leaf bad been torn off. Anxious not
to be deprived^ of any of Hhe news of the
day, a member of theScbadde family went
to the corner grocery and borrowed a
Call. On the leaf corresponding to the
one torn from their paper, was found a full
account of Brooks' shortcomings.
On last Thursday morning the Schaddes
again found their paper mutilated. Once
more a leaf was missing. On procuring
another paper they found on the missing
leaf an account of the disappearance of
Millionaire Campbell. The piece of paper
THE SAN TBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
The Gunboat Bennington Came Down From Mare Island Yesterday and Anchored Off the Ferry
Slips. Later She Dragged Her Anchor and Drifted Below Jackson-Street Wharf. She
Was in Close Proximity to a British Steamer and a Bark and Had ' to Be Moved.
torn from the Schaddes' Call was found
crumpled soon after beneath Mrs. Win
throp s window.
That paper was mutilated before any
thing was published in The Call connect
ing Winthrop's name with Campbell's
disappearance.
It w"ould seem that the person wbo was
interested in keeping the neighbors unin
formed upon the Brooks matter took the
same course to leave them in the darK
about Campbell's disappearance, and that
before Winthrop's name was connected
with the affair.
Mrs. Winthrop could not be seen last
night regarding the story just related. She
was at her father's home and it is said she
was suffering from extreme nervousness
and not in a condition to see any one.

dark brown ; eyes, blue; arrested in Ban Fran
cisco June 10, 1895. by Captain Lees and De
tective Ross Whitaker for the murder of Mrs.
Jennie Mathews by giving her a poisonous pill
while in Laurel Hill Cemetery; conspicuous
dimple on right cheek; claimed to be a civil
engineer; whs assistant superintendent of the
Laurel Hill Cemetery up to May, 1894; has
not been employed regularly at any work
since the above date.
Mrs. Dunton, the owner of the house at
4109 California street, where the aged mil
lionaire was detained, made a statement
to Captain Lees yesterday. She said in
effect that she advertised the house to rent
in a Sunday's paper. She had two callers,
the second giving bis name as Archibald.
She was shown Winthrop's photograph
and at once identified it as that of tiie man
who so called himself. "Archibald" ex
amined the house, and was more pleased
| with the front and rear entrances than
with anything else. He agreed to rent
the house and paid $2 50 as a deposit, and
she gave him a receipt, telling him to call
upon her agents. A. M. Speck & Co., and
if they were satisfied to pay the balance of
the rent to them.
Winthrop called again next morning
aud brought a receipt from Speck & Co.
and a note 4hat "Archibald" was unknown
to them, but was well recommended by
the bearer, his friend. Speck had known
Winthrop, so that he had to tell him that
he wanted the house for his friend Archi
bald, instead of for himself. Winthrop
told Mrs. Dunton to hurry out of the
house, as be expected his wife, and as she
was extremely nervous he did not want
any one to be in the house when she came.
In her hurry to get out Mrs. Dunton left
her cloak, which was found by Captain
Lees Thursday night.
Winthrop was seen downtown on
Wednesday evening about 7:30 o'clock.
A gentleman, whose name Captain Lees
refuses to disclose, spoke to him for a few
minutes in a nail entrance previous to a
meeting of a council of the American Pro
tective Association. The gentleman did
not see him at the meeting. It was re
ported that a young man was seen eoing
up to Winthrop at tbe time and whisper
ing something in his ear, which made him
leave hurriedly. Captain Lees says that
is not true. The captain hinted that
Winthrnp had been seen later, but he
would not say where, when or by whom.
On Wednesday evening Winthrop had
bis mustache and side whiskers shaved
off, apparently with the object of disguis
ing himself as much as possible.
A story was published that Winthrop
was seen riding to his house Tuesday
evening on a bicycle and riding hurriedly
away again. The captain says it is not
true, as he has proof that Winthrop was
not at home all that evening.
Archie Urquhart, who first gave the in
formation of Campbell and Winthrop hav
ing been seen by nim on Montgomery
street Monday afternoon, will return to
the city on Tuesday. The police are eager
to see him, in view of the statement of nis
friend Koch, that Winthrop had made a
proposition to him to join in the scheme
to kidnap Campbell.
No one seems to know anything about
"Pete," and tbe only clew to him that the
police have is the description given by
Campbell.
MR. CAMPBELL'S FRIENDS.
They Believe That the Wealthy
Hawaiian Would Not Deceive
His Wife.
In Honolulu, where James A. Campbell
has lived so long and is best known, be is
reputed to be a man of sterling character
and of great wealth. His property con
sists of Honolulu real estate, sugar planta
tions and island securities. He did not
take an active part in the revolution which
dethroned Liliuokalam and established
the republic, but it is known to Hawaiians
that his sympathies were with the "old
Government," as it is now called.
Paul Neumann was in the City yester
day, and speaking of Mr. Campbell said :
"In Honolulu be is known as a man of
high character. He is reputed to be worth
$2,000,000, but he does not spend his
money lavishly or make a display of his
wealth. He is a Scotchman who married
after he went to the islands and has
brought np a family there.
"I should take no stock in the story that
he left the Occidental Hotel for a lark or
that he knowingly sought the company of
dissolute and fast men. I have never
heard of him going off on a 'bender' and
accounting for bis absence by mysterious
adventure. It is my belief that he has
told Captain Lees tbe straight truth,
without embellishment, concerning his re
cent experience in San Francisco."
William Foster, another well-known
man, who lived quite a long time in
Honolulu, iÂ»aid yesterday of Mr. Camp
bell: "I knew him there as a well-to-do
and honored citizen, whose reputation for
veracity was never called in question.
He was a friend of the 'old Government,'
as many other good citizens were, but he
did not take any part in the revolution
one way or the other. I think he was
prosperous and satisfied under the old
order of things.
"He is a rich man without doubt. I
never heard of him going off on sprees and
associating with dissolute fellows. I am
convinced that the story which he told to
the police is true. "
A member of the Grand Jury who
listened with the deepest interest to the
narrative told by Mr. Campbell in the
jury-room last Friday remarked yester
day: "lam convinced that Campbell was
shadowed at the Occidental Hotel, and
the plot to lure him away was concocted
before he went to San Jose.
"It is my belief also that more than two
were concerned in the plot. Campbell
was seen about the hotel, and it was easy
enough to ascertain that he was a. man of
means. Having nothing to do but put in
his time before the steamer sailed he prob
ably made some acquaintance at the bar
by spending his own money in an easy,
offrband, generous way.
"It was part of the scheme. I fancy
that one of the gang of robbers went to
San Jose, and there picked up what
seemed to be a chance acquaintance with
tbe old gentleman. There did not seem to
be a weak link in the chain of his story,
and tbe marks of violence indicated the
ordeal through which be had passed.
"Mr. Campbell did intend to sail for
Honolulu on tne next steamer, but to dis
prove the stories afloat he has decided to
remain here indefinitely."
CAMPBELL'S STORY.
Strange Account Given by the Mil
lionaire Of His Meeting With
Winthrop.
Yesterday evening in a long conversa
tion with a Call reporter Millionaire
Campbell went into all the details of bis
capture and captivity. During bia narra
tive be said:
"1 first saw this man Winthrop on the
porch of the Hotel Vendome on the even
ing of the Ist, I think it was. I was in
conversation with two men when he moved
his chair a little closer to the group and
joined casually in the talk. He wanted
my advice on investing money in a coffee
plantation on the islands, and then he
wanted me to assure his invalid wife that
the climate would be beneficial to
j her. I told him that I would
not advise any one to invest
money down there and perhaps blame me
afterward if it proved unsatisfactory. I
told him be baa better see the place for
himself first. As to bis wife, I informed
her that not being a physician
and having no knowledge of her
ailment I would not recommend the
island climate. Then he left. I have
positively identified him from the pic
tures in the possession of the police as
Winthrop.
"Monday afternoon, the 3d, he came
into the Occidental and spoke to
me again about talking with his sick
wife. He is a poweriuily built man
about five feet ten or eleven in height, a
face once seen not easily forgotten, yel
lowish white, as though there was no
blood in it, a dark mustache and
thick, coarse hair. He first wore
a light brown Fedora hat and a
dark suit, but when he last came into
the house before leavinp, as he remarked,
for Mexico he had a black hat.
"His companion, the man who
had the pistol and who wore
the mask all the time, was
a fellow about five feet six in Height. The
other man called him 'Pete.' I think
that he must have known me be
fore, and that is why he was so care
ful to conceal his face from me. He
wore squeaky shoes, and I could always
tell by them when he was about. He
would walk up and down in the Hall dur
ing the day. He did not remain in the
room with me. "Pete's" conversation
sounded like that of these men
that work round a racetrack â not
the jockeys â but that may have been
feigned. HÂ« had no peculiar or foreign
accent. From his actions at the time they
were robbing me and after that I decided
that he was not an old hand at that sort of
business. He seemed to be nervous.
"It is not possible that Winthrop was at
his borne between 5 and 6 o'clock Monday
night; i don't care who says he saw him
there. He stayed in that house all that
nightâ all the time after we got there. He
passed in and out of the room, DUt he
never was gone long.
"Soon after we got there, soon after I
was bound to the chair, they were busy
preparing the papers, and it took them
some little time. Then he tried for a long
time to get me to sign tnem. We started
from the Occidental about 4 o'clock.
"The next morning Winthrop told me
that he had orders to torture me if I did
not give in. They closed the folding-doors
to the front room, and I heard them
pounding in there and I heard the sound
of metal.
"I decided that they were getting ready
to do the torturing. But when they un
fastened my elbows and took me into the
next room I saw my mistake. They put
me on the bed, sprang handcuffs upon my
wrists and then removed the rope.
"They ran a chain about four feet long
through the handcuffs and the other end
was fastened to the floor. Then they tied
a rope about my waist and fastened the
handcuffs to it and took half-hitches about
my thighs and bound me down to the bed.
"I could only lie on my back. I would
not eat or drink though they asked me if I
wished to. All this time I was gagged.
"When I was released I walked two or
three blocks before getting on the cars,
hoping that I might see a policeman and
return with him at once, but I saw no one.
I dared not go up to one of the houses, as
I knew nothing of the people there."
WHAT THE NEIGHBORS SAY
The Abducted Planter Should Have
Recognized His Guide When He
Was Released.
Josephine Dunton, a 15-year-old girl
who is a friend of Mrs. Dunton, the owner
of tbe premises at 4109 California street, is
the only person wbo claims to have seen
"Pete," the smaller man, face to face.
Josephine is at present engaged as a do
mestic in a family residing at Ashbury
Heights. Up to Tuesday afternoon she
had not been apprised of the removal of
Mrs. Dunton, and called at the residence
to get some of her belongings.
"I went to the back door," she said,
"and was met by a young man who just
looked at me and grinned. He was awfully
dirty, and his clothes were ragged and
filthy. He had a cigarette in his mouth
and looked just like a tough. He had
black marks down the sides of his face.
"I asked him where Mrs. Dunton was,"
she continued, "and he just grinned and
shut the door."
Such was the story Josephine told Mrs.
J. J. Muloney on Wednesday afternoon,
when she called to find where her mother,
as she called Mrs. Dunton, had moved.
Later, when the girl had heard of Camp
bell's story, she made some additions to
her tale. She then said she had lifted up
a window-shade and gazed into the kitchen
for a moment There she saw what looked
like the body of a man on a Jarge arm
chair. It was covered over with a cloth.
Campbell, however, says that he was not
in the room which she indicates, so if she
saw anything it was not Campbell.
Mary Ragatto, the 13-year-old child of
the neighbor on the immediate left of
the Dunton premises, claims to have
seen the men leaving by the back en
trance about 8 o'clock Wednesday even
ing. The Ra<. attos have a porch over
looking the Dunton rear entrance. Here
Mary says she was standing Wednesday
i vening, when she saw a tall man and a
short man pass through the gate, and,
crossing South California street, disappear
toward Geary.
J. J. Maloney, who is employed as a
deputy in the Recorder's office, says he
noticed the curtains of one of the" rear
windows parted Tuesday morning as
though some one was peering out. He
also noticed a light Tuesday evening in
the room where Campbell claims to have
been confined. Airs. Maloney "says the
only signs of life she heard about t! c
place was a hammering Monday after
noon. She remarked at the time the
neighbors were chopping kindling wood,
but never saw any smoke.
Campbell's statement that he was un
able to see distinctly the features of the
man that guided him toward tbe Geary
street car seems remark ibie when the
locality is viewed at night. Only a few
feet from the rear entrance of the Dunton
residence an electric lamp on the corner of
California street and Second avenue
throws out a flood of light. To have
taken the course he describes and as cor
rooorated by Mary Ragatto, he must have
walked in the full glare of this light.
Maloney says he remembers the light was
all right that night, for by it he recognized
several of the party of detectives wbo
came about midnight when Campbell had
reported the matter. The light through
which Campbell must have passed is
nearly as strong as daylight and in it a
person could easily be seen distinctly for
twenty or thirty yards at least.
The house, although closely crowded by
neighbors on each side, is in one respect
admirable for the purpose of confusing a
stranger. Both ends face on a street, and
either might be mistaken for a front en
trance. A flower-plot graces each.
San Jose Testimony.
A dispatch was received from San Jose
last night stating that no one at tne Yen
dome remembers seeing Winthrop or a
man of his discription with Capitalist
Campbell. Winthrop was not registered
in the Garden City during Campbell's
stay, at least not under his own namt>,

The United States gunboat Bennington
came down from Mare Island yesterday
and anchored off tbe ferry slips. Soon
after everything was made snug tbe war
ship began to drag her anchor and in the
course of half an hour she was opposite
Jackson-street wharf and in close proxim-
ity to the British tramp steamer Strati,
garry. An iron ship was anchored close
by and from Clay-street wharf it looked
as if all three vessels were in a cluster.
The Bennington was right in the fair
way of the Sausalito and Tiburon ferry
steamers, so Chief Wharfinger Root lost
no time in ordering her out of the way.
He got on board the tug Governor Mark
ham and went out personally to serve no
tice on the captain of the gunboat.
Shortly afterward steam was cot up on
the Bennington and she was moved out of
the fairway.
The anchorage off the ferries is not as
good as it used to be and all heavy vessels
accnored tncre drift more or less. When
the Philadelphia was there two months
ago she picked up her anchor and only
manage d to find holding groucd when she
was off Lombard-street wharf.
Another tramp steamer arrived in port
yesterday. She is the Cedar Branch from
Yokohama and she will load wheat at Port
Costa for Liverpool. Nearly all the grain
crop is being handled by steamers, and it
*ooks as though tbe sailing: vessels will
have to remain at anchor for some time to
come before they get a charter.
Tbe Umatilla pot in from Puget Sonnd
ports yesterday. Captain Huuter was in
his element, as there were three bridal
couples on board. Professor Anderson of
Stanford University was also a passenger.
He was accompanied by his wife and they
spent a most enjoyable month among the
Alaskan glaciers. W. Lawson, the repre
sentative of R. P. Rithet & Co., Victoria,
B. C, agents of the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company, also came down to spend
a holiday in San Francisco.
The Hawaiian ship John Ena arrived
from Newcastle, N. S. W., last Friday
night. On June 11 she was caught in a
heavy southeast gale and lost three lower
topsails, a staysail and fore and main
sail. Tbe cargo shifted and the ship had
a narrow escape. , It was the only inci
dent during the passage and fine weatner
was experienced from that time on.
There were some lively times on Jack
son-street wharf yesterday. The "hoboes"
have been making a camping ground of
the place. They invaded the wharf early
in the morning and made three meals a
day off the fruit stacked there. Nelson &
Anderson, owners of the river steamer?,
got tired of having to pay for the stolen
fruit, so yesterday they employed a watch- "
man. The latter drove the loafers off the
wharf, but many of them showed fi^ht
and blood flowed in consequence. A num
ber of arrests were made. In future
tramps will be wary of making a free
meal off fruit brought here by the river
steamers.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamer T. C. Walker,
was back in commission yesterday. Re
pairs to her engines were made and she is
now as Rood as ever. In future the steam
ers of this line will carry all the freight of
the Valley Road from Stockton to San

All the delayed ships seem to be arriv

FREE TRADE WORKS RUIN TO THE IRON INDUSTRIES.
It was shown in yesterday's Call, by
the testimony of a number of experts of
all shades of political belief, that free
trade in pigiron and in the manufactured
products of iron and steel lead to commer
cial ruin and industrial pauperism. This
is certainly an object lesson in the study
of tariffs, and one few can ever forget. On
a closer examination of the subject it may
be asked why the policy of Bryanism leads
to penury for the masses. The answer is
simple, and may be summed up Dy the
statement that free trade inevitably brings
the workmen of America to the basis of
the underpaid workmen of Europe.
As water seeks its level, so do wages,
under international competition, seek the
lowest point. In the case of iron the wage
scale of America would spaedily reach
that of overworked and underpaid Eng
land. Lest this term be considered vague
and meaningless, this expression deroga
tory to England's wage scale, let a few
stubborn facts be submitted concerning
that scale. Let the reader see, by a refer- |
ence to facts, what is meant when the |
wage scale of England is referred to as a
low one, and the best evidence is that of
those who live in England and who have
studied the conditions that prevail. A
few unimpeachable opinions are sub- I
mitted:
Speaking of the miserable condition of !
the ironworkers and manufacturing popu
lation of England under conditions such
as William Jennings Bryan says would
bring a millennium here, John Bright,
the famous orator, said: "Nearly a third
of the whole people dwell in homes of
only one room, and more than two-thirds
of the people of Scotland dwell in homes
of not more than two rooms. We find
poverty and misery. What does it mean?
It means more than I can describe and
more than 1 will attempt to describe, and as
need begets need, so poverty and misery
beget poverty and misery. In fact, in
Jookine at the past, to me it is a melan
choly thing to look at, there is so much of
it which excites in me not astonishment,
but horror. The fact is, there passes be
fore my eyes a vision of millions of fam
iliesânot individuals, but families â
fathers, mothers and childrenâ passing,
ghastly, sorrow-stricken, in never-ending
procession from their cradles to their
graves."
Lest the evidence of Blight be disputed
on the subject under investigation, let the
reader behold another picture of the con
ditions which American freemen would
be compelled to confront if the Democrats
had full sway. This is from the pen of
John Morley, who says:
"It is an awful fact â it is really not
short of awful â that in this country
(Great Britain) with all its wealth, all its '
vast resources, aU its power, 45 per cent â
that is to say, neariy one-half â of the

AT SANTA CRUZ.

SANTA CRTZ, Cal., Aug. B.â As the j
summer girl â and this is a town of sum- !
mer eirls just now â puts the last magical
touches to her toilette and then fitly
crowns her beauty with the latest in hats,
so this afternoon Santa Cruz placed the
finishing ornaments on her festival attire
preparatory to the great parade to-night
of the Pacific Coast Turn Bezirk and the
three days' festival that is to follow. New
banners, new flags and more lanterns went
up.
Twice this year has beautiful Santa
Cruz put on holiday attire. The decora
tions for the water carnival were the ad
miration of all beholders, but tne thou
sands of people who viewed the great
demonstration to-night were impressed
with the self-evident fact that the thrifty
and enterprising Turner societies were
not to be outdone.
An immense crowd greeted the visiting
Turners on their arrival, about 8:30
o'clock, at the stations in special trains.
The line of march was formed with ad
mirable precision, and ther> the long pro
cession moved down Pacific avenue, the
principal business street.
It is the good fortune of Santa Cruz to

Without a Protective Tariff American Workmen
Would Become as Poor as English
Artisans.
persons wno reach the age of 60 are or
have been paupers. I say it is a most
tremendous fact, and I cannot conceive
any subject more worthy of the attention
of the Legislature, more worthy of the
attention of all."
And here is Professor Thomas Huxley's
picture of England under free trade: "A
population whose labor is insufficiently
remunerated must become physically and
morally unhealthy and socially unstable;
and though it may succeed for a wnile in
industrial competition, by reason of the
cheapness of its produce, it must in the
end fall, through hideous misery and
degradation, to utter ruin."
And yet this British free-trade tariff,
the parent of most of the poverty and deg
radation above referred to, is the kind of
tariff free-traders would have us adopt.
It is no wonder that D. H. Mason said,
after studying the English and American
sides of protection and free trade:
"All the prosperity enjoyed by the
American people â absolutelyall the pros
perity without any reservation whatever â
from the foundation of the United States
Government down to the present time,
has been under the reign of protective
principles; and all the hard times suffered
by the American people in the same pe
riod have been preceded either by a heavy
reduction of duties on imports (or by a
threat of such reduction) or by insuffi
cient protection; thus refuting all free
trade theories on the subject."
It was shown quite extensively in The
Call yesterday that the application of the
Cobden Club's free-trade ideas, loudiy
championed by Bryan, has always hurt
the iron business of the United States.
This showing was made by the evidence
of practical men engaged id the business
rather than by the views of dreamers. A
few more opinions in the same line are
relevant.
In replying to the Tariff Commission
inquiry two years ago the president of the
Witte Iron Works Company of St. Louis
saiii :
"I know that if free trade is a tact ;
goods we now have a monopoly on will be j
sold lor some less, and therefore the work- j
men must stand their share of the cut and
loss of business. Please remember every I
dollar of work done in foreign countries
will take so much from the American
workman. Just now (February 22. 1894)
trade is so that there is no profit at all i
have block after block of railed verandas |
over the sidewalks, and on such occasions
as these they are strikingly useful. The
avenue wat> a highway of red fire, and
galleries of people looked down on the
brilliant spectacle moving slowly along
below. Roman candles exploded into the
red atmosphere globes of yellow, blue and
green, while hi^h above burst the sky
rockets with their stars and let fall their
sparks in gentle showers. The street and
the sidewalks and the windows were full
of faces. Santa Cruz has perhaps never |
seen a parade that was so beautiful.
First came Grand Marshal Emil Meve
on horseback, wearing the festival colors,
red and white. He was a most conspicu
ous figure amid the red glare and bursting
fire. Ajar defying the lightning was not
more spectacular. The band followed
him. Immediately behind rode tbe Naval
Reserve in uniforms. Then came the
Grand Army of tiie Republic, wearing
their familiar hats and marching with
veteran precision of step. Next came a
cluster of carriages. In one was Lieuten
ant-Governor Jeter and Mayor Davie of
Oakland, and behind them came Mayor
Clark and the City Council of Santa Cruz.
The Schuetzeus in their hunting cos
tumes made as picturesque a section as
there was in the procession. The Santa i
Cruz and visiting Arions received a worthy
welcome, and so did the 500 visiting Turn
ers from San Francisco, San Jose, Oak
land, Sacramento Napa, Marysville and
other points.
The Santa Cruz Tarn Verein formed the
last section of the parade. All the Turn
ers of Santa Cruz wore light-colored soft
felt hats with bright bands of red and
white.
Tne paraders carried on high at least I
600 Japanese lanterns. Walls of red and j
white along the avenue, countless red and
white streamers and banners overhead
and scores of red iicbts flashing from
roofs and balconies completes the picture
of the parade.
The Santa Cruz Turn Verein assembled
at its hall and marched to the station to
receive the visitors of the Bezirk. The
line of march was down Pacific avenue to
the lower plaza and a countermarch to
the carnival pavilion, where the exercises
of welcome took place. The pavilion was j
magnificently decorated for the tuinfest.
The platform was draped in pink, red and
white, interwoven with tbe American
| Natoinal colors. t
Little redwood trees were distributed
around the borders of the hall. Pink,
white and sky-blue scarfs were stretched
from a common line in the center of the
roof and allowed to droop gracefully down
the walls on the sides, where they were
made fast. The ceiling was finished in
yellow and white bunting, and beneath it
was a fishnet studded with roses, produc
ing a very beautiful effect. Japanese
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
and we are all glad to see our debts paid i
with no falling back. How much longer
this is to continue just depends on what
our Senators and Congressmen will do."
It is generally known that the country
has fared worse ever since under that ob
noxious feature of Cleveiandism known as
the Wilson bill, the same ruinous measure
that William Jennings Bryan stoutly ad
vocated as a panacea for all ills when he
was struggling to make a reputation in
Congress.
Here is the way the members of the
Pierce Artesian and Oil Well Supply Com
pany of New York thought the Wilson
bill would affect business in the iron in
dustry. They said:
"As an expression of our views in regard
to the matter referred to we will say in a
very few words that it is our desire that
the duties now existing shall be retained
on all raw materials and manufactured
products. If the Wilson tariff bill, as it
has passed the House of Representatives,
should pass tbe Senate and become a law
it will be ruinous to this country. Already
two large companies in our line of busi
ness failed during the past six months
and have gone into receivers' hands as a
result of the proposed new tariff laws.
One of these companies failed for $1,500,000
and th? other for more than $800,000.
"As you ask for a full expression of our
views, we will say further that at the time
of the last Presidential election the officers
and employes of this company were Demo
cratic by a large majority and voted the
Democratic ticket, but, judging from the
expressions of the same persons recently,
we believe that if tbe Wilson bill as it now
stands becomes a law there will not be an
other Democratic vote cast by any of the
men referred to."
That is another opinion of the ruin
wrought by Bryanism, an opinion from
those of his own political faith, men who
cannot be accused of prejudice or undue
bias. In the same line was the evidence
of tbe Stillwell-Bierce Company of Day
ton, Ohio, whose reply to the argument of
Bryanism was:
"We strongly oppose the Wilson bill
and urge that existing tariff regulations
be continued. Nine months ago we were
employing about 700 men, nearly all of
them skilled mechanics; full time at full
wages. Now about 350 men, seven hours
per day, at a reduction of 10 per cent in
wages; and unless there is a speedy im
lanterns formed a pleasing contrast to the
dark-green background of the redwood
trees.
At the entrance to the pavilion was a
brilliantly illuminated triumphal arch.
The archway of the main entrance was
ablaze with incandescent lights. This
pavilion and its decorations is one of the
sights of the turnfest.
The pavilion after the parade was
crowded with people. Those who came
early got seats, those who came later did
not. The Naval Reserves headed the pro
cession into the pavilion, and the proces
sion followed in about the same order as
in the line of march. The various so
cieties and the visitors ranged themselves
along the sides of the vast auditorium.
Lieutenant - Governor Jeter, President
Walti of the San Cruz Turn Verein and
other distinguished personals marched
down the center of the great white floor,
while the band played an inspiring air.
Mayor Davie of Oakland came on the ex
cursion train, but got lost in the shuffle
and was not present to take part in the
programme. The occasion was enlivened
by the drum corps of the San Francisco
Turn Verein.
Seated on the platform were Lieutenant-
Governor Jeter; J. R. Walti, president of
ths Santa Cruz Turn Verein ; Albert Custin,
president of the Pacific Coast Bezirk; Hugo
Otto, vice-president; L. Ziegeler, L.
Weber, George Keffel, Louis Henning,
Carl Klein. F. Schumacher, and mem
bers of tbe City Council. President Walti
extended a few words of welcome in Ger
man and then Lieutenant-Governor Jeter
was introduced. The Lieutenant-Gov
ernor, in the inforced absence nf Mayor
Clark, who is a physician, extended a wel
come. He said:
"The town is yours. We want you to
enjoy yourselves. If at any moment you
feel that you are not having a good time,
we want you to report your case instantly
to Mayor Clark.
"We hope that after the festival the
good people of Santa Cruz, which is the
most Hospitable city in the State, will
long remember it, and I feel they will.
As you have had a long ride on the cars
and have not had your supper we will not
detain you lone We all know that the
German people know how to refresh the
inner man."
Three cheers were given for the Lieuten
ant-Governor. Albert Cnstin of San Jose,
president of the Pacific Coast Bezirk,
wished the assembled Turners good luck
while in the city and called for three
cheers, which were given with rousing en
thusiasm. Light refreshments were
served to the visitors and an informal re
ception followed.
The iollowing judges of competition
have been selected from San Francisco

Oscar Hansen, R. Barth.

provement in business shall be obliged to I
still further reduce our force and also j
wages. If there are abuses under the
present law correct them, hat do not
strike down or seriously interfere with the
great and beneficent principle of protec
tion to American industry, under which
we have grown strong and great, and
have been prosperous above all other
nations."
That is another fair example of the way \
laboring men fare under the free- trade j
dreams of the Democrats, and yet there i
are those who say that there is no tariff j
question in this election. If anything has ,
emphasized the fact that there is a tariff {
question of vast proportions in this coun
try, it is the idleness of workmen and
the silence of factories under the Wilson
bill. Mr. Bryan's strong plea for absolute
free trade has awakened tbe country to
the fact that there is a free-trade question
of vast proportions in the land. No class
knows this fact better than the iron work
ers, numbered by thousands in the factory
centers, where all is idleness now, yet
where industry reigned under protection.
Here is a characteristic opinion from
B. C. Perry of Island Falls, Me., manu
facturer of edge tools. He says :
"I have manufactured edge tools for the
past fifty years on a small scale, employ
ing from one to eignt men, making chop
ping axes mostly.
"Supplying a portion of the local borne
market has been my business, which. lam
very sorry to say, is now paralyzed, with
the lumbering and kindred interests, by
the tariff agitation and uncertainties.
This is no supposition, but cruel fact.
Lumbering is one of our leading indus
tries, which is prostrated by the present
tariff agitation. Wages of laboring men
here have decreased at least 35 per cent,
as far as my knowledge extends; and that
is by no means the worst feature of tbe
case, for where there was one man in en
forced idleness eighteen months ago there
are rifty to-day.
"It is useless to go into details, for expe
rience has demonstrated repeatedly in my
remembrance that the policy of protection
is much the best for tbe United States
until our great and varied resources are
much more developed. I was a free-trade
Democrat in my young days, but one trial
of the fallacy was experience enough for a
lifetime. Since that we have had more of
the same sad experience, and now the

The athletic and competitive exercises
and the shooting contests of the Turnfest
will begin to-morrow morning at the
grounds, which are convenient to the city.
Reveille will be sounded at 6 o'clock in
the morning as an introduction, and the
sports will continue at the grounds and in
the pavilion until a late hour in the even
ing, concluding with a grand concert. Tbe
programme of events will last through
Tuesday, and there is now some talk of
adding 'special features for Wednesday.
The following is the Sunday programme:
At 6 o'clock reveille will be sounded. At
7:30 the turners and their guests will
march in procession to the festival
grounds. On arrival the rehearsal of the
wand exercises will begin. Then will fol
low gymnastic exercises in classes, exer- >
cises on the horizontal bars, parallel bars
and vaulting horse. At 10:30 a. m. the
public prize target shooting will com
mence. From 12 m. to Ip. m. there will be
an intermission for lunch. At Ip. m. the
prize tourney will benin and continue
until 4 o'clock, when the bears (gentlemen
between 40 and 70 years) of San Jose will
perform dumbbell exercises. Then will
tollow club swinging by the ladies' class
of the San Jose Turn Verein ana bugle
call for the commencement of the wand
exercises; an oration by Albert Corrliill
president of the Pacific Turn Bezirk;
Kiami exhibition drill, consisting of wand
exercises. A dance and concert will con
tinue from 11 a. m. until 6p. m. At 6p. m.
the turners and their guests will return in
mere .threat or approach toward it is
enough to shake the country from center
to circumference. Now. the remedy is
plain : Strike hands with the protection
ists and announce to the world that hence
forth the policy of the Democratic party
is protection to home and not to foreign
industries, and my head for it you will in
augurate an era of intense activity and
prosperity such as even proud and favored
America has never witnessed before. Heed
this advice and this country will send up a
shout that will shake the heavens: other
wise England will rejoire, but America
must mourn."
The foregoing advice certainly bears
many evidences of being from a practical
source the opinion of a man who tells
from experience rather than from theory.
The Co-operative Foundry Company of
Rochester, N. V., made a pointed reply to
the Tariff Commission's inquiries, saying,
among other things: "The unexampled
prosperity of this country during the last
decade may be attribute ole to the advan
tages of a protective tariff more than to
any other one influence We believe that
if the manufactures of this country are
brought into direct competition with the
wares made in any other country where
wages are materially less, there will be
but one alternative â an equalization of
wages -not from lower to higher, but
from higher to lower. We believe that
any course which will lend to the intro
duction of goods into this country on a
cheaper basis than we now manufacture
them, through a reduction or abolition of
duty, will lead inevitably to idleness on
the part of our mechanics or to their de
pression to the exact level of wag.es in
competing countries."
The Road Machine Company of Kenneth
Square, Pa., gives the following:
-Michael Laffy, the well-known Mary
land manufacturer of iron goods, says:
" 'I regard the Wilson bill as it now
stands as a thoroughly bad measure, but
think it it is passed tbe largest share of
the burden will fall on labor. I should
also say that I am connected with two
other mining companies in the same sec
tion; one employing about 250 men and
producing about 40,000 tons per year,
which mine is now closed, and one" em
ploying about sixty men and producing
about 25.000 tons. But the history of all
three companies is very much the same,
so I suppose the others would be of no in
terest to you.' "
The more minutely the iron industries of
the country are studied the more thor
oughly it is seen that a wise protective
tariff is essential to the prosperity of man
ufacturers and the maintenance of the
wages of workmen. No one who knows
the first principles that apply to the ques
tion of international competition will
rleny the fact that if American factories
have to compete with cheap foreign labor
they must reduce the wages of their own
workmen, and this is one of the greatest
evils of the free-trade theory of Bryan.
procession. At 5 p. m. the prize recitals
will take place in the Turn Verein Hall in
presence of the judges only. At 8 r. m.
there will be a concert.
The people of Santa Cruz and the turn
fest committees are extending a most
hospitable welcome to all visitors. To

but the citizens are setting about to make
them feel at home.

PORTLAND, Ob., Aug. B.â Mayor Pen
noyer's political eccentricities are the ab
sorbing topic of gossip in Portland. It is
believed he still has many undreamed
of surprises in store for the people.
He is a peculiar man, and those bavin?
known him almost a lifetime do not
understand his varying nature.
In an interview with Councilman Ma
lone the Mayor said that he would de
prive him of every bit of public patronage
he heretofore enjoyed because be voted
against the confirmation of all of the
Mayor's nominees for Poundmsster. The
six other Conncilmen who with Malone
constitute the Solid Seven also are under
the Mayor's ban for a similar reason. This
circumstance may make them more solid
than ever, and should they succeed in
winning over to their side one of the
Mayor's allies his Honor may be ren
dered absolutely powerless during the re
mainder of the term, as two-thirds ma
jority of the Council, which eight mem
bers constitute, would divest Pennoyer of
the power to distribute any patronage be
yond that granted him under the city
charter â the appointment of the Fire and
Police Commissionersâ without the ap
proval of the Council. It is highly prob
able that the Council may secure the sup
port of Councilman Peery, who, though a
Democrat, does not believe in vesting too
much power in Pennoyer.
On Wednesday a petition was banded
to Mayor Pennoyer, signed by all
the lire underwriters here, protesting
against tbe removal of good men from the
Fire Department only because they were
onposed to Bryan, as such a course would
jeopardize the great interests of the insur
ance companies in this city. With refer
ence to this matter his Honor makes the
following characteristic reply:
"in regard to the communication of the
insurance men to myself and the Board of
Commissioners, speaking for myself, I
will say that I can attend to my business
without their interference, and they may
attend to their business without my inter
ference."
That there is much indignation in in
surance circles to-day cannot be concealed.
The underwriters say chat they have no
desire to dictate to Mayor Pennoyer as to
whom he shail appoint, but they do claim
to have tbe right to expect protection of
their large interests from him. They are
opposed to his appointment of men to
E laces in the Fire Department who would
c incompetent to cope with a large fire,
thus jeopardizing large fortunes. They de
clare that in the event such changes are
made in the department as will in their
judgment impair it, insurance rates will
instantly go up aiong the eutire line.

Choynski.
maledictions at the perverseness and de
lay manifested by pugilists in general in
arranging for a boxing match.
Yesterday afternoon Joe McAuliffe and
Iddy Graney. the latter representing Joe
Choynski, signed articles for a contest of
eight rounds, tbe conditions of which
were stated in yesterday's Call.
So the "Mission Giant" and "Chrysan
themum" Choynski on the 2Sth inst. will
cheerfully punch the smiles off each
other's faces in the endeavor to convince
the sporting fraternity that only the brave
deserve the fair.
Shortly after 5 o'clock, the hour ap
pointed for the meeting, Barney Farley
appeared with his hnge cnarge in tow.
Barney was again uneasy. Rumors had
reached his ears during the day that the
wicsed National Club was endeavorine to
thwart h ; t< plans by matching Choynski
and Alex Greggains.
His anxiety, however, was speedily dis
pelled by the arrival of Eddy Graney and
C'hauncey Chovnski. Tbe party, consist
ing of McAuliffe, Farley, Graney. Chaun
cey Choynski, Jimmy. Carroll, Director
Houston, Billy Daly and "Youne Mit
chell,"' adjourned to a private room.
Discussion of the articles was at once
begun. All were in perfect harmony as
regarded the conditions of the articles to
be signed, with the exception of the num
ber of complimentary tickets.
This was discussed' at some length.
Considerable trouble has heretofore been
had at all boxing contests with regard to
the number of these tickets issued, and all
complained that they had been imposed
upon in former exhibitions.
A list had been made out and was
handed in by Daiy for inspection. In
cluding press, official and a few others,
the number aggregated 125. This was
finally adopted as the proper number.
Then McAuliffe signed, followed by
Graney. Houston witnessed the signa
tures. In full the articles of agreement
read as follows:
NEW OCCIDENTAL CLUB
(Incorporated.)
This agreement made and entered into this
Bth day of Auirust, 1896. between John L.
Herget, authorized to represent the New Occi
dental Club of the City and County of San
Francisco, Cal., party of the first part, and Joe
Choynski of San Frtincisco and Joe McAuliffe
of San Francisco, parties of the second part.
Witnes.Mith, that the said party of the first
part in consideration of the agreements on
the part of the said parties of the second part,
hereinafter contained, agree with the said
parties of the second part, and more particu
lary described as follows, to wit:
That the said parties oi the second part agree
to participate in a scientific glove contest of

erned by Marquis of Queensberry rule*-, with
five (5) ounce gloves, subject to the police au
thority and under the provisions of a permit
pranted by the Board of Supervisors of this
J Said party of the first part agrees to furnish
Woodward's Pavilion in complete order, the
other exhibitions, all advertising and biH
postlnK, doorkeepers, ticket-sellers and all at-
Upon compliance with the above conditions
by tfce said party of the first part and tbe said
parties of the second part, it Is mutually
agreed tbat the door receipts shall be divided,
to wit: The parties of the second part, Joe
Choynski and Joe McAuliffe, or their repre
sentatives, shall receive sixty (60) per cent of
the gross receipts, and John L. Herget, the
party of the first part, forty (40) per cent of the
gross receipts.
The box-office and boxplace shall be in
charge of the club and the parties of the sec
ond part shall have representatives on the
door or doors aud possession of the keys to
me ticket-boxes.
It is mutually agreed that the complimen
tary list shall be restricted to 125, and any
addition thereto shall t>6 by the mutual coc
ten t of all parties concerned .
The gaid club reserves the right to cancel
this agreement if tnere is any collusion be
tween ihe parties of the second part.
Said parties of the second part agree, in con
sideration, to meet at the office of the above
club August 27, 1890, at 2 p. m., and select a
referee, subject to the approval of the club, for
the contest to take place August 28, 1896, at
Woodward's Pavilion, and also agree to take
no part in any contest after signing this agree
ment, previous to this contest, without the
consent of the above club, and further agree
to be at the ringside at an hour stipulated by
tho club's directors.
The parties of the second part agree to
present a contest satisfactory to the club's di
rectors and members.
In the event of a failure to comply witn the
terms hereof by the said parties of the second
part, the said party of the first part, represent
ing tne said club, shall be released from all
obligations.
The said parties of the second part also agree
that the training quarters will be under the
supervision of said club.
In witness whereof the said parties have
hereunto set their hands and seals, the day and
year first above written.
John L. Herget,
JOS. P. McAULIFFK,
E. M. Graney lor Joe
Choynski.
Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence
of Jxo. Houston.
After signing the articles it was given
forth for publication that the two princi
pals had agreed for the winner to take 50
per cent of the gross gate receipts and ihe
loser 10 per cent.
The prices of admittance to the contest
were fixed at |1, $2 and $3.
McAuliffe said he wished to correct a
statement made in one of the morning
papers to the effect that the pur 9Â« should
be evenly divided or the loser take 25 per
cent of the gross gate receipts. Joe was
so anxious to sign articles that he was
willing for the winner to take all.
Then the conference ended. Joe will
doubtless remain in training at Barney
Farley's, while Choynski is not known to
have selected his training quarters yet..
Anyway the two well-known men will
come together the 28th of this month ana
shake their gloved lists at each other.
For His Lost Foot.
William Craven has sued the Southern Pa
cific Company for $50,250 damages for in
juries received August 9,1894. In hlscom-
plaint Craven claims that while we was
proceeding to work at Kan Jose avenue and the
railroad Crossing a train of freightcars blocked
his way. At tne invitation ot a brakeman he
passed between the cars, but at that moment
the iocomotive started without warning, with
the result that Craven's foot was crushed and
he was permanently maimed.
WILL NOTRAZE BUILDINGS
The Board of Health Calls a
Sudden Halt on One of
Its Projects.
Chinatown Rookeries May Stand Tet
a WLile, but Will Be Ordered
Closed.
The Board of Health has decided that it
will not brave the legal ; storm that it
would have invoked had it carried out its
intention of tearing down rookeries in
Chinatown that are said to be menaces to
the public health. At first the board was
loud â even vociferous â in , its ( declaration
that Chinatown mast be cleansed by tear
ing down some of the most obnoxious
buildings and that such* course. was to be
pursued whettier or not the property
owners liked it. â  ' â 
The first check to the destructive career
of the board came when Chief Crowley of
the Police bepartment and Chief Sullivan
of the Fire Department, on being asked to
participate in the razing of the buildings,
declared emphatically that,, they would
have no hand in it ; and that, moreover,
they believed the board was 'exceeding" its
rights in destroying property that way. { ;
A majority of the board argued with the
officials, but in vain, and the matter came
to a standstill.
Yesterday at a conference it was de
cided to forego the razing for the present
and until the legal rights of the board in
the premises have been clearly defined.
In the meantime buildings that have
been declared by ' the i inspectors to be in
bad sanitary condition will be condemned
and the owners required to close and keep
them closed. All . tenants , will %be ex
pected to rind other quarters, and thorough
fumigation will be resorted to to prevent
disease from spreading from 1 . the unsani
tary buildings pending the decision as to
their fate.
As the closing of buildings will entail a
big loss on the owners, a legal : fight is ex
pected even :â  over th is measure, and the
powers of the board will doubtless be
definitely settled before the matter is
finally adjudicated.

Mrs. Scott Vindicated.
Mrs. Elizabeth Scott, one of the fashionable
dressmaker! of the City, now doing business
at 1107 Butter street, was acquitted yesterday
in Judge Campbell's court of a charge brought
against her by Mary Lynch. Mrs. Scott recently
went East and sold out to Miss Lynch giving
into her custody a valuable clock. On Mrs.
Stoti's return she demanded the clock, but it
was refused, and upon her taking possession
of it a charge of petty larceny was placed
aeainst her name. She was arrested but im
mediately released on bonds, and yesterday
was completely exoneratea of any wrongdoing
and placed in possession of the clock. Mrs.
Scott is very indignant at the treatment to
which she has been subjected and is advised
by her attorneys that she has n good case for
defamation of character against the responsi
ble parties. ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
WILL THERE BE
A CITY ELECTION?
The Question Involves a
Complicated Legal
Tangle.
HOW LONG IS A TEEM?
Officials Waiting to See if Their
Term Is Two or Four
Years.
FORCE OF THE FEE BILL LAW.
Clerk Curry's Wise Courseâ Liability
of the Sheriffâ Attorneys'
Views.
Will there be an election of municipal
officers for San Francisco next November,
or will the incumbents hold over for an
other two years? Will Sheriff Whelan
and the other City and County officials
(with the exception of County Clerk
Charles F. Curry), who refused to obey
the fee-bill law enacted by the Legislature
of last year, be liable to civil actions for
damages by persons who have been finan
cially hurt? These are the questions
which are just now bothering the brains
of lawyers and laymen, and which can be
finally determined only by an anxiously
expected decision of the Supreme Court of
California.
Two test cases are now pending before
that august tribunal, vis. : Julius Kabn,
plaintiff and appellant, vs. Adolph Sutro,
William Broderick, James N. Block,
Harry T. Creswell and Charles S. Tilton,
constituting the Board of Election Com
missioners of the City and County of San
Francisco, and William M. Hinton, the
Registrar of Voters, defendants and re
spondents; and David Hale, respondent,
vs. Edward McGettigan et al., composing
the Board of Supervisors of Solano
County.
The tenure of office issue is involved in
both of these cases. Reddy, Campbell
and Metson are the attorneys, amici
curiee, in the San Francisco case, and in the
Solano case the respondent is represented
by Messrs. R. B. Carpenter, F. C. Lusk,
Garret W. McEnerney and Frank R, Dcv- !
lin. All of these attorneys are of the
opinion that the decision of the Supreme
Court last Friday in the case of Henry
Miller et al., appellants, vs. Charles F.
Curry, respondent, foreshadows the ulti
mate indorsament of their position con
cerning the four years' tenure of office,
and that there will not be any election for
City officers this year in San Francisco.
County Clerk Curry, acting under the
advice of Delmas & Shortndge, took the
safe course, and followed the provisions of
the fee bill of last year.
Sheriff Whelan ignored the new law,
and may, in consequence, become liable
to actions for damages. In fact, it is gen
erally understood that the only muni
cipal offiter who has enforced conscien
tiously the provisions of the fee bill is
County Clerk Curry, and for so doing he
has been subjected to much unmerited
abuse. The probity of his conduct and
the wisdom of his attorneys are now fully
vindicated.
In the Miller-Curry case it was argued
by appellants that the act of March 28,
1895, though a general act, does not in
tarms repeal the act of 1866; that thera is
no necessary repeal by implication; that
it does not in terms apply to the officers of
a city and county, and that, therefore, the
general statute is to be read as silently ex
cluding from its operation the special
statute of IS6& Says the Supreme Court
in its decision:
The law under consideration la general in
Its terms, and, while it makes no distinct
mention of officers In consolidated govern
ments, it undertakes to establish the fees not
alone of county and township officers, but of
other officers in this State. In the somewhat
anomalous municipal corporations recognized
by the constitution and known to the law as
consolidated cities and counties, the officers
do not lose their distinctive character as
county officers and of city officers merely be
cause they hold within the corporate limits of
,Buch governments. The County Clerk of the
City and County of San Francisco, Bheriff of
tne City Â«nd County of Satt Francisco, Re
corder of the City and County of San Francisco,
are each and all county officers. They have
no place properly as officers of the City. Upon
the other hand, the i^ayor of the City and
County is distinctly and separately a City
officer, as distinguished from a County officer.
A law, therefore, which under the constitu
tional mandate undertook to regulate the
duties or the compensation of county officers
would fill all the basic requisites of the con
stitution, that all laws of a general nature
shall have a uniform operation (Con., Art. I,
Bee. 2), if it should be held that its terms did
not apply to and were not meant to apply to
county officers in consolidated governments.
And it must therefore be concluded, without
room for question, that the act under con
sideration la in Us terms applicable to the City
and County of San Francisco.
So it is thus finally determined that tbe
statute of 1895 controls the collection of
fees of all county officers in San Francisco.
Sheriff Whelan will accordingly be com
pelled in future to adopt a new schedule.
It is provided in section 1 of the act of
March 28, 1895, that the Sheriff shall
charge and collect the following fees:
For serving any process, writ, order or paper,
except as hereinafter provided, required by
law to be served by the Sheriff, 50 Cents.

For transporting prisoners to the County

For executing and delivering any other in

In the case of Julius Kahn vs. Adolph
Sutro et al., the question presented for
solution is whether the provisions of the
act entitled "An act to establish a uni
form system of county and township gov
ernments" apply to the City and County
of San Francisco, and particularly whether
the provisions of section 60 of the act pro
viding for the election of county and town
ship officers at the general election to be
held in November, 1894, and every four
years thereafter, apply to said City and
County.
"The reasoning of respondents," says the
appellants' attorney, "will certainly be
very ingenious if they can discover a logi
cal plan by which the City and County of
San Francisco can be excluded from the
operation of tne county government act,
and be controlled in relation to the elec
tion of its officers by any act whatever,
if they say by section 4109, we can reply,
as we have argued above, it is now a
special law, applying to the City and
County of San Francisco alone. If they
say the consolidation act, we can reply
that it was repealed in that respect by sec
tion 4109, Political Code, when that section
was amended in 1883, and became a general
law applying to the whole State. And
even if it be controlled by the consolida
tion act, the writ should have been
granted for the reasons already stated.
"For these reasons we submit that the
only construction that can be placed upon
the county government act without doing
violence to principles of constitutional
law, as already declared by this tribunal,
and without overruling numerous de
cisions of this court, is to decide that said
act does apply to the City and County of
San Francisco."
Concerning the case of David Hale vs.
the Board of Supervisors of Solano
County, R. B. Carpenter of counsel for
respondent, said : "Our contention in the
case now pending before the Supreme
Court and involving the terms of the pres
ent county officers of the State, is that the
provision excepting counties of the eighth
j class from tne four years' term of the
I others and limiting the eighth class to
two years is unconstitutional. The de
cision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Miller et al. vs. Curry, indicates that it will,
in due time, sustain our position.
"The county government act of 1883
was superseded and repealed by the
county government act of 1891, and the
I county government act of 1891 was re-
I pealed by the county government act of
J 1893. And this is so even if it were to be
I assumed that the provision relating to
{ elections is unconstitutional and invalid.
Each successive county government act is
intended to and does repeal the preceding
county government act; so that, unless
the act of 1893 is valid as to elections, there
is no law for the holding of elections, and
the result is aÂ« has already been claimed
under the point lastly made, that the in
cumbents must hold their offices until
the qualification of their successors, and
there can be no successors until there is a
law providing for their election."
And such is the condition of this com
plicated legal tangle, which can be un
raveled only by a decision of the Supreme
Court.
THE COCKING MAIN.
Defendants Will Be Tried by a Jury
Next Wednesday.
The men who were arrested last Sunday
on board the barge Yolo on the charge of
making preparations for a cocking main,
appeared before Judge Low yesterday
morning. They were represented by At
torney Edward Sweeney, who demanded
a trial by jury, and requested that one
man be tried and the rest to abide by the
decision of the jnry.
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said
he would consent to the latter request if
Sweeney would allow the prosecution to
name the man. Sweeney objected, but
finally consented.
The cases were continued till next
Wednesday, when John Maher will stand
trial.
Committed to Jail.
William Cronin, charged with embezzling
$235 from E. Benson last March, pleaded
guilty yesterday in Judge Bahrs' court to
petit larceny, and on motion of the District
Attorne" Cronin was convicted of the minor
offense. ' He wÂ»b sentenced to six months'im
prisonment in the County Jail.
Secundino V.arello was sentenced to two
years in San Quentin prison for assault with a
deadly weapon.

MRS, CRAVEN'S MARRIAGE CONTRACT,
The Document Was Ac
knowledged Before a
Notary.
SHE HAS ANOTHER DEED
Property Presented to Her by
Senator Fair as Long Ago
as 1889.
HER EVIDENCE SUPPORTED.
The Notary Will Testify to the AcÂ«
knowledgment of the Marriage
Contract Before Him.
Lying upon her sickbed, with her physi
cian in attendance to warn her against
over-excitement and to call a halt when be
saw the signs of danger from it to His pa
tient, Mrs. Nettie R. Craven continued her
deposition in the suit to quiet title to the
properties for which she holds deeds from
the hand of James G. Fair.
The number of lawyers was limited and
members of the press were excluded be
cause of the brevity of the space in the
sickroom. Only the official court report
ers were present taking notes. Even with
these precautions the room was crowded.
Mrs. Craven bore up under the inquisition
beyond the expectations of her physician,
and when he put a stop to it at 4 o'clock
she remonstrated. She seemed eager to
go on and, as she said, get through.
The testimony was full of interest. The
marriage contract was submitted and also
a letter which is in a fashion a republica
tion of the will. Considerable new matter
was developed. It was shown that the
marriage contract nad been ac
knowledged before a notary, Lee D.
Craig. Mrs. Craven also stated
that she had still another deed for some
outside property given her as far back as
1889 by Senator Fair, the location of which
she did not at present know.
Mrs. Craven was clad in a pink silk
nightdress with lace trimmings. Her
daughter Margaret sat beside her through
out the ordeal, adjusting the pillows at in
tervals and furnishing refreshments, with
an occasional cup of beef tea. Dr. Clinton
came in during the morning hearing, and
after examining his patient allowed her
to proceed, although she was showing evi
dent signs of extreme nervousness.
Her attorneys, D. M. Delmas, Judge de
Haven and W. W. Foote. sat beside the
bed at a small table furnished for their
taking of notes.
W. M. Pierson, representing Crothers
and Angus, conducted the examination.
With Garret McEnerney he sat at the
foot of the bed, the latter taking notes, sug
gesting questions and watching the wit
ness intently. Lansing Mizner, Mr. PeTcy
and G. W. Williams were present. The
faithful Mrs. Haskins was present also.
The inquiry began with Mrs. Craven's
first acquaintance with Senator Fair. She
was introduced, she said, by Archibald

Borland in 1880 or 1881. They both lived
at the Occidental Hotel at the time, and
saw much of each other from that time
forward. The contract of marriage was
entered into on May 23, 1892.
"Have you the writing?" was asked.
The witness produced the contract, in
closed between two sheet} of paper.
"In whose handwriting are the words in
this paper : 'San Francisco, Cal., May 23,
1892. I take Nettie R. Craven to be my
lawful wife. I take for my lawful hus
band James G. Fair?' "
"In my handwriting."
"Where did you write that, Mrs.
Craven?"
"823 Sutter street."
"Was anybody present at the time?"
"Senator Fair and myself; no one else."
Mr. Pierson wanted the witness to relate
all the circumstances attending what
he termed this " important epoch
in her life," but she insisted on
the questions being asked, as she did not
know, she said, what he desired to know.
In answer to questions thereon she said
she did not quite remember whether it
was late in the afternoon or in the even
ing. She usually kept her working desk
in the front room, and she thought it was
written in the parlor or the front room.
"Did Senator Fair come up there by ap
pointment on that occasion?"
"He told me he was coming. I knew be
was coming. I don't know how."
"Weli, what led up to the execution of
the contract?"
"We bad talked of it for several years
before. He suggested it. We talked about
it a great many times. He dictated the
contract."
"When did yon first exhibit that
paper?"
"To my daughter in 1892. I may have
shown it to Mrs. Johnson. I know I told
her about it. I took it to Judge J. F. Sul
livan the day after it was signed to ask
him if it was a legal contract of marriage
without being acknowledged beiore a
notary."
"'And he advised you about it?"
"Yes, sir."
"Who else besides Judge Sullivan and
your daughter saw the contract?"
"There may have been others, but I
don't remember. Oh, yes; the notary
before whom we acknowledged it then. I
am positive of that."
"The notary before whom â "
"Before whom it was acknowledged."
"What? This paper?" *
"Yes."
"Well, is this acknowledged?"
"This is acknowledged before a notary."
"Do you mean the certificate of ac
knowledgment attached to it?"
"It was not attached to it."
"What do you mean by being acknowl
edged ?"
"I mean that Senator Fair appeared be
fore a notary and took the acknowledg
ment of that as being his handwriting
and his wish and mine."
"But no certificate was made to it or
attached to the paper?"
"A certificate was made to it j yes, sir."
"Wuat became of that certificate?"
"I think it was in the possession of the
notary."
"What notary was that?"
"Lee D. Craig."
"And why was the certificate not at
tached to it, Mrs. Craven?"
"Because we desired the marriage to be
kept a secret and tbe notary said he could
take the acknowledgment, but if he put
his certificate on it he would have to put
the record in his books and it would be
come public property."
"And the idea was that he could at any
time thereafter make out bis certificate
and date it back as of that day. Is that
the idea?"
"No, sir. Senator Fair asked him t<s make
a memorandum of it and a certificate of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, . SUNDAY, ; ; AUGUST ,9, : l^sn*.
the date and the time and to keep it in his
office as a protection for me."
"Was that done?"
"I presume it was done. I hare not
been able to â "
"You were present at the conversation
of the notary?''
"I heard the conversation."
"The Senator requested him to make a
memorandum, not in his book, but some
independent memorandum?"
"Some memorandum that would protect
me in case anything should happen."
"Have you seen Mr. Craig since then?"
"Se-veral times. He called here once
since I have been confined to the house. I
have not seen the memorandum. I asked
him if he remembered what Senator Fair
had said and he answered that he did."
"Did Benator Fair explain to Mr. Craig
at the time why he wanted no acknowl
edgment put on this?"
"He said be did not want it acknowl
edged until he could get his financial
affairs in a state so that he could leave for
a year, and hÂ« hoped in that time to be
able to do so."
"What day was this acknowledgment?"
"On the 24th; the day after its date."
"Did you go from your residence with
tbe Senator?"
"No, sir. I met him by appointment on
Montgomery street, corner of Sutter. He
went to see Judge Sullivan, and if Judge
Sullivan said it would not stand to meet
him and he would acknowledge it before a
notary. He told me that at the time we
signed the coutract. We met on Montgom
ery street and walked along to a building
MRS. CRATEN GIVING HER DEPOSITION.
where there is a big opening, where we could
talk. I told him Judge Sullivan said the
paper was legal but would be stronger if
acknowledged before a notary. As we
were talking Mr. Craig came along, and
Mr. Fair beckoned to him. The Senator
said . be wanted to acknowledge a
paper before him, and he wanted to
know if he could keep a secret for
awhile. The notary said, 'Bring your
paper down.' I told him I had the
paper. The Senator explained that ne
wanted it kept secret. Mr. Craig said he
could acknowledge it, but could not put
a seal on it withoutentering it in his book.
He asked the usual questions â we botn
acknowledged it in that way.
"Now, during the portion of 1892 that
you were here after the 28th of May and
during the entire year 1893 did you see
Senator Fair frequently?"
"Whenever he was in the City, I did."
"How frequently?"
"Well, he varied bis calls. Bometimes
he would come in once a week, sometimes
twice a week ana sometimes not for two
weeks."
"At what hours of the day or night
would he call?"
"At all hours."
"Did you ever visit Senator Fair at his
office?"
"I have. I visited him during a num
ber of years that he had his office at 231
Montgomery street."
Witness stated that she first saw the
deeds for the Pine and Sansome street
property on September 24, 1894. Senator
Fair was talking about providing for me.
He had been writing his will, and some
one remarked that tie had not provided
for Mrs. Craven, and he took the deeds
from his pocket and handed thorn to her
saying: "ThiÂ» is the way I bavo provided
for you. I have given you the Pine
and Sansome street property and the
Mission-street property that you have
passed so often."
The question of having them acknowl
edged came up. Fair said they were
just as good not being acknowledged,
as she could have them "placarded"
in the Hall of Records. She said she
would prefer that he would have it ac
knowledged. He asked if she knew a dis
creet notary who would not tell about it.
She said she did not. He said that he pre
ferred she should take the responsibility
ot having it acknowledged, as, if it got out,
she would blame him. Fair took the deeds
and returned them to her afterwards ac
knowledged.
She had received a letter which was
placed under her door. It was written in
pencil.
Subsequently she received a telephone
message from Fair, asking her to come to
see him â to meet him "on Montgomery
street; that he was sick and it might be
the last day he would be out. She went
down and saw him on thx- street, but as
she had company with her and had an
other engagement, she waved him off with
her hand.
"Did the Senator have a passkey to
your house?"
"No, sir."
"Who suggested his making a will in
your house?"
"He had been talking about it for some
time. He had the will prepared on slips
of paper before he came to the house, all ex
cept two clauses. Those clauses refer to the
teachers' pension fund and to Charles
Fair. I wrote that out for him. He had
told me that Pierson and Mitchell and
Goodfellow were after him to make a will,
and be did not want to make it their way."
After he completed the will in pencil
the witness suggested that he copy it in
ink. He said it was just as good in pen
cil and it was hard for him to write in ink.
He consented to do so, however,

afterward. He had come to the
house for the especial purpose
of writing the will. He said they had
been after him so much to make a will
that he was determined to make one where
they could not get at him. She had told
Mrs. Johnson of the Colonial Hotel about
having the will before Senator Fair's death.
After much discussion the following let
ter was produced by Mrs. Craven, but it
was not read. It Is the only letter of the
Senator's she had at hand. It read as fol
lows:
December 16, 1895.
Dear Mrs. Craven: I thought I would see you
to-day. lam a sick old man. 1 want you to
keep my will of September 34 safe. I want it
to knock out all the papers those fellows are
dogging me into signing. Your paper was re
turned to me, and I want to deliver it in per
son to you soon. Kindly and ever,
James G. Fair.
"What did you regard as your claims
against the Fair estate, Mrs. Cravenâ not
the value, but what were the claims? '
"As Senator Fair's wife and the
deeds. Mr. Lloyd came out to my
school and offered me $250,000 to re
lease all mv claims irrespective of
the deeds. I refused to accept it. I
asked him if he was offering that for me
to produce a will. He said no. I told
him i was entitled to all Senator Fair
intended to give me."
The witness stated that in 1889 Senator
Fair had given her a deed to a piece of
property which she thought was out of
the City. The deed was not to be
recorded until after Senator Fair's death
and as he was a hale and hearty man at
that time she paid little attention to it.
She had said nothing to Lloyd about this,
although she had mentioned it to her own
attorney, Mr. Williams, since the Senator s
death. .. â , , .
A recess was here taken until 2 o clock,
Mrs. Craven inviting all present to
luncheon. The invitation was accepted
by all except Pierson, McEnerney and
Perry, who claimed engagements down
town.
In the afternoon the inquiry was di
rected toward the compromise contract.
"I understand," said Pierson, "that the
contract for the $500.000T0 be paid to you
was conditioned that you should deliver
up the will and the deeds."
"I don't know as to that. Mr. Lloyd
and Mr. Wheeler and I don't know how
many others spoke about that."
"Was there any time fixed when you
should be paid the money?"
"No time was fixed as far as I under
stand."
"Was not the cash to be paid when con
veyance was made?"
"Not that I know of."
"Was not this arrangement made with
you personally?"
"No; it was made by my power of attor
ney, though I was spoken to about it."
"At whose suggestion was it that you
went East for the will of the 24th?"
"Mr. Lloyd and others urged me to go
for it."
"Was that after the contract had been
made with you?"
'â¢There was some talk about the com
promise before I went Eastâ as to my re
linquishing my claim under the deeds.
"You wanted an understanding as to
the matter before you produced the will,
is that it?" k . ...
"No, sir; I offered to produce the will
without any consideration."
"I would like to know if you understood
you were to receive $500,000 before you
went East?"
"I was asked if 1 would rehnauish my
claims before I went East. The contract
Â»f marrisge was to die with Senator Fair.
"Were you to receive any compensation
for going East?"
"Only that I was to get the $500,000
upon the relinquishment of my claims.
Mr. Lloyd wanted to pay my expenses but
I said: 'No, it shall not cost Â£ou a cent.
If you want it you can have it. "
"Was any part of it to be paid in cash?
"I do not know of my own knowledge.
"If yon were to receive $500,000 for mak
ing a conveyance why did you not make
it?"
"I did not have time to stop. I came
hurriedly from Sacramento and they
rushed me off for the will."
"Couldn't you have got it without
going for it?"
"My daughter could not have given it
to any one without getting word
from me."
"Well, couldn't you have written
for it?"
"I couldn't write and have it sent by
mail."
"Yon sent it by mail?"
"Yes; but I wouldn't have had it re
turned that way. I felt that my repu
tation was at stake, and I wanted
to see it safely back myself.
I arrived in New York March 4 at 2:40
r. M. I went to my daughter's residence.
She was not at home. I asked the jani
tress if she had the keys to
my daughter's flat. She said no.
I asked leave to lie down in her apart
ments and she permitted me to do so. I
remained there till evening, when I took
a hack to the theater where X knew I
would find her as she was playing. It was
the Standard Theater, I think. After the
play, where I saw my daughter, we went
to i)r. Brown's, and remained there until
a day or so before I started back. My daugh
ter and 1 went to see John W. Mackay, as I
was afraid I could not come back and I
wanted to have him send it. He was in
Washington and we did not see him. I
started home the following Monday."
"When you got the v&ckage was it In
the same coudition as when you sent it ?"
"Yes."
"The lead-pencil and ink document in
it?"
"Yes, sir."
"What did yon do with them?"
"I placed them between the mattresses
of my bed. I kept them there until I went
home, except for the day I went to Mr.
Mackay's I took them with me, as I hoped
to give them to him.
"You came home by the Pennsylvania
Central to Chicago?"
"1 think so."
â¢'A gentleman came on at Chicago and
said he was the custodian sent to tafce
charge of the will. I supposed that was
the arrangement, as Mr. Lloyd had been
telegraphing me to get such a custodian
in case I could not come."
"Now, did the stranger say he was the
representative of Mr. Milholland or of
Mr. Lloyd?"
"Well, Mr. Milholland never used the
word custodian, and Mr. Lloyd had fre
quently done so in his telegrams, and I
judged he was from that side.''
"Did you learn, his name? :>
â¢*H. C. Harcourt."
"The wills were both in the same en
velope?"
"Yes. sir."
"And you took one out and handed it to
him?"
"Yes, sir."
"You selected the one you thought the
better of the two?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you see him again?"
"Oh, yes, I saw him frequently until
Reno was reached. I expected to have to
stop at Omaha as I was so ill."
"Who made the arrangements that yoa
and Mr. Harcourt should not speak to
each oth -r?"
"I don't know whether there was any
arrangement. I told him not to come and
talk to me with that paper. I was afraid
that I would be recognized. I
was afraid the will would be stolen.
A will had been stolen from the City Hall
and it had got out at Sacramento, and I
did not know how many people the law
yers had told that I was after it, and it
would not be strange if some attempt
would be made to steal it from a sick
woman."
The witness told of her arrival in the
City, being met by Mrs. Haskins and
being driven to her home and the subse
quent conferences with the attorneys
in this City.
"When you were in the East were you
in telegraphic communication with attor
neys representing the Fair children?"
"1 received some telegrams and some
were addressed to my daughter."
"Did Mr. Fair makje any other wills in
your house or in your presence?"
"Yes, I am quite sure he made six."
"When did he make the first?"
"About 1890. He took that will away
with him afterward."
"Between 1890 and 1894 he made six wills
in your house?"
"Yes, sir."
Alter some further questioning along
these lines, that did not develop anything
important, Dr. Clinton, Mrs. Craven's
physician, intervened on account of her
physical condition, and the taking of the
deposition was adjourned to Monday
morning, August 10.MAY BE CHARGED
WITH MURDER.
Jury-Briber John H. Hurley
Assaults an Aged
Convict.
USED AN IRON POKER.
His Helpless Victim Was Al
ready on the Verge of
the Grave.
ALL HOPE OF A PARDON CONE.
Governor Buid Refuses to Interfere,
and He Gives Mrs. Hurley Some
Gccd Advice-
John H. Hurley, the big ex- ward heeler
and convicted jury-briber, although con
fined in the State prison at San Quentin,
may be called upon to answer a charge
more serious than embracery. He is now
confined in a dungeon at the prison for
having made an unprovoked and brutal
assault with a deadly weapon upon John
Pettie, another convict, who for some time
past has been on ths verge of the grave
with lung troubles, fte beating he re
ceived at the hands of the big jury-briber
will possibly hasten the end.
The assault was committed on last
Thursday and the weapon used was a
large iron poser, two feet long and half an
inch in thickness, that does service to slir
the coals in the big hospital- ward stove.
When Hurley was on trial in this City
he played the insanity dodge, but not so
successfully as to prevent nim from being
sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
Even in the State prison he has attempted
to excite interest in his case. The officials
told him plainly that his ruse was a dat
failure and that if he desired to receive
the sympathy of any one he must behave
himself or his would be a hard lot.
Hurley evidently came to the conclusion
that he was on the wrong trail and his
conduct improved, but still his natural
instincts would come to the surface, and
caused the officials some annoyance-
A week or so ago ne required the atten
tion of a physician, and Dr. Lawler or- J
dered tim sent to the hospital ward, â¢
where he was shown every attention that
nis case demanded. This attention spoiled
him and his ugly disposition came to the
front again.
On Thursday afternoon Hurley learned
that he was to be removpd from the hos
pital to his old quarters, and the news did
not please him. JJr. Lawler went to the
office on some business, and no sooner had
he reached the outer gate than Hurley
gave full vent to his pent-up wrath. Seiz
ing the big stove poker he sprang upon
the poor old consumptive Pettie, who was
lying in bed, and beat him unmercifully
with the weapon.
Blow after blow fell upon Pettie's head,
arms and back before the big jury-briber
could be overpowered and disarmed.
When Dr. Lawler asked of him an ex
planation for his conduct, Hurley said J
that Pettie was trying to give him poison I
in his medicine.
Huxley 'a victim was found to be in a
bad way. The blows upon his body were
particuiarlv severe and may hasten his
death, as "Pettie frequently has several
hemorrhages of the lungs during each
day. While before the assault the old in
valid's death would not have caused sur
prise, it is now almost certain, and fea
tures may grow out of the case that will
bring the jury-briber before the courts on
a charge of murder or manslaughter.
It is believed that Hurley's vicious burst
of temper was caused by his learning that
Governor Budd had refused to grant the
petition for pardon recently sent to Sacra
mento. Mrs. Hurley and her husband's
attorney have worked hard to secure sig
natures to the petition for Hurley's par
don, and to some extent they were suc
cessful, inasmuch as several of the jury
who tried the fellow affixed their signa
tures to the document. They were in
duced to do so, however, upon the under
standing that Hurley would leave the
State and not return, if the pardon was
grante I. Mrs. Hurley forwarded the pe
tition to the Governor, and on Friday she
received his answer by letter.
Governor Budd firmly but politely told
Mrs. Hurley that be would not pardon her
husband. A jury of fair and impartial
citizens had found Hurley guilty of a
very serious charge and the Judge had
passed a very light sentence considering
the grave nature of the crime.
It was apparent to Governor Budd, so
he said, that the only reason the jurymen
signed the petition was in the hope that
the man would leave the State. Every
thing considered, the Governor saw no
reason for interfering with the course of
justice.
In conclusion, Governor Budd made a
kindly suggestion to Mrs. Hurley. It was
that she take her children and return to
her family in the East. Hurley, he said,
could join her in a short time, for under
the credit system, for good behavior, his
short terni would be materially decreaed.
News travels rapidly and along mys
terious routes to the convicts inside of the
prison walls, and it is likely that it was
this unpleasant news that caused Hurley
to fly into such a rage and make the as
sault upon the old man. The seriousness
of this offenje will deprive him of all the
credits he might have gained by good be
havior, and if that is the only punishment
he receives he will be very fortunate. Old
man Pettie may die at any time.
A BURGLAR FOILED.
He "Was Arrested While Attemptiug to
Enter the Residence of Keuben
11. Lloyd.
An unsuccessful attempt was made by a
burglar early yesterday morning to break
into the residence of Reuben H. Lloyd,
tne attorney, at 1010 Folsom street.
About 3 o'clock a milkman who was de
livering milK at the residence observed a
man hiding in tne yard. He gqve no indi
cation that would lead the man to know
that he bad been discovered, and when he
met Policeman M. J. Cooney he told him
about it.
Cooney on his way to the residence met
Special Officer J. Dougherty and together
they entered the yard. They saw the
man in the act of trying to slide back the
catch of one of the dining-room windows
with & long, thin knife. Cooney covered
the maa with his revolver and ordered
him to throw up his bands. The burglar
instantly complied. Cooney searched
him and beside the knife he had a revolver
in his hip-pocket. His shoes were off, and
after the officers had made him pat them
on he was taken to the Southern Police
btation, where charges of attempt at burg
lary and carrying a concealed weapon
were made against him.
He gave the name of John Webber, 29
years of age, and his occupation as a clerk.
Nothing is known of bis history, but the

Wilson Bros.' Storage Department Not
Affected by the Fairmount
Hotel Fire.
An erroneous impression ha 3 gone
abroad since the fire a few days ago at the
Fairmount Hotel, to the effect that Wil
son Bros., who were losers at the fire, had
goods damaged that had been left with
them for storage. While it is true that
the firm had a small quantity of storage
goods at their warerooms in the Fair
mount Hotel build ing, none of these goods
were at all injured by the fire.
The fact of the matter is that the bulk
of the storage business carried on by Wil
son Bros, is conducted at their fireproof
warehouses located at 800 to 808 Buchanan
street. At this location they have a
warehouse 210 by 65 that was con
structed at a cost of over $40,000.
It is strictly fireproof and is con
ceded to be one of the best storage
warehouses west of New York. It is so
constructed that not alone can a general
storage business be done, but customers
can be provided with separate rooms with
special locks, wherein goods and mer
chandise of every description can be
stored.
An important feature of the business is
their padded vans whereby furniture and
all kinds of merchandise, including
articles of the most delicate description,
can be conveyed to the storage-rooms
without damage.
The firm of Wilson Bros, has always en
joyed an excellent reputation, and this
explanation should serve to demonstrate
to their patrons that no risks are taken by
those who intrust their goods for storage
to this firm, fortified as they are with
facilities for extending to their patrons
immunity from fire and other devastating
agents.

The following communication has been
received :
Captain William E. Van Reed, (I. S. Army

Artillery, who, after a most painful Illness,
died at his home, 1908 Page street, of this
City, at 5:15 o'clock this morning, bore
his sufferings to the last with a fortitude and
heroism worthy of the brave and fearless
soldier he was In battle.
In his untimely death the officers who knew
him and his many friends have lost a most
genial, kind-hearted, sincere and warm friend.
No one ever knew "Little Van," as he .was
affectionately called br nis brother officers,
without loving him. Full of hospitality,
â  affability and generosity, he was as geutie as a
' maiden, as he had been brave as a lion in war.
The older officers remember with pride how
conspicuous his bravery was at all times in the
field, and how gallantly, to instance a case, he

Alas! Dear old fellow 1 You have gone
where your comrades will follow you ere long;
but your gallant deeds will not be buried with
you. While these live your memory will be a
most precious memento to them, and a great
country will never forget to be gratefully in
debted to you for the valor, patriotism, devo
tion to duty and noble example it was your
good fortune to set your countrymen in the
hour of the Nation's greatest peril.

The wheelmen of this City, and par
ticularly the officers of the different clubs,

improvement of the streets to attend a
meeting, which will be held on Monday

San Francisco, August 8, 1896.
Dear Sir: After personal conversation with
the leading wheelmen of this City. I am con
vinced that, from a political standpoint, the
concerted action of wheelmen is our oniy hope
for attaining any improvement of our streets.
To accomplish this end the method to be
pursued should be a subject of joint debate by
representatives of the bicycle clubs, Pursuant
thereto, I take the liberty of requesting you
to meet the captains and presidents of the
other clubs in convention at the Imperial
Clubhouse, 614 Van Ness avenue, on Monday
evening, August 10, at 8 o'clock sharp.
Our co-operation on a subject of this im

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
W. H. ALFORD OPENS
THE CAMPAIGN.
The Democratic State Leader
Talks to the Iroquois
Club.
HE DECRIES FACTIONS
Says That the Doubtful East Is
Waiting to Hear From the
Golden West
SILVER IS NOT SECTIONAL.
Many Local Democrats Enjoy Their
First Small Season of Speech-
Making.
Chairman W. H. Alford of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee practically
opened the State campaign by making a
speech before the Iroquois Club Friday
night.
It was a big meeting of the club and |
many speeches were made, but everybody
was mainly interested in seeing and hear
ing and meeting the new and young State
leader, who has so recently come to the
front from Visaiia. When Chairman Gil
dea introduced the comparative stranger,
amid cheers, Mr. Alford said in part;
I propose to conduct this campaign upon the
basis of equal rights to all. I propose to hold
the high office of chairman above factional
fight or factional difficulty. My only object is
to unite the new, the purified Democracy of
California that it may march in unbroken
columns to battle and to victory.
The Republicans have the money on their
side. We have truth and right and justice
upon ours. We have heard It said that the
silver question is a sectional question and that
the South and West are arrayed against the
East. There never was a more false statement
uttered. If silver is a good thing for the West
It is a good thing for the East.
If it Is a bad thing forthe East it is a bad
thing for tne South and West. The truth is
that the sentiment of the East has not been
heard. What haa been called the Eastern sen
timent Is the utterances of a few men who
are the mouthpieces of the law-made million
aires who cluster upon the harbors of the At
lantic and around the barren rocks of New
England.
The real sentiment of the East, the sentiment
of the common people, who arestarving within
the s hadow of the palaces of millionaires, who
pretend to represent them â the sentiments of
these men have never been expressed. They
are waiting to-day, waiting for the signal from
the West, waiting for California's sun to rise.
Is there not room for enthusiasm, for hope ?
Fe How- Democrats of the Iroquois Club, look
around you. Look in these times of ours,
when gold controls the acts of men and
shapes the policies of nations; when the in
dorsement of the Rothschilds is worth more
than the indorsement of England; when
honor seldom tips the beam if balanced
against coin; when friendship, self-respect
and truth itself are dashed aside in man's mad
rush for gain; when every passion of the hu
man heart seems lo6t in the all-absorb
ing love of wealth; when all ambitions
are swallowed up by the one ambition
to be rich; when financial failure is
synonymous with social ruin and the
career of success is born in the heart of self
ishness. A young giant of the West and of
the people, with no money at his command,
with no capital but his intellect and his honor,
steps boldly Into the arena and calls upon a
-wondering world to take notice that he chal
lenges all the champions of wealth and
monopoly, with firm faith that the people will
yet arise in their might and right every
wrong.
W. P. Sullivan, chairman of the Junta
local Democracy, made a graceful and
well-received speech.
Louis Metzger told an interesting story
about his trip to the Chicago convention
and the East. He presented to the club
as a relic a part of the California banner
carried by the California delegation in the
Bryan convention stampede, and evoked
cheers by announcing that he had ordered
for the IroqucisClub in the East a superb
Bryan and Sewall banner, 30x40 feet in
size. '
DID THE RAILROAD'S WORK
How Superintendent Ashworth
Brought a Pavement to
Grade.
Bat the Corporations Paid the Bill
When the Job Was All
Completed.
As the result of complaints that have
been made within the past few days the
Street Department and Superintendent
Ashworth are busy explaining how it was
that the work of paving the portion of
Jackson street, between Front and East,
that is supposed to be kept in order by the
street railroads using the thoroughfare,
was done by the Street Department's em
ployes.
Some time since the work of relaying
the pavement on Jackson Btreet was be
gun, the blocks having been down so long
that they were badly off grade and seamed
here and there with gullies and
hillocks dangerous to passing teams.
When the work that fell on the City was
complete it offered such a contrast to that
between and alongside of the tracks that
the merchants in the neighborhood at once
began to complain and lodged a number
of vigorous objections with the Street
Department to the street remaining iti the
unsatisfactory condition.
Shortly afterward the complainants
were astonished to see the workmen in
the employ of the Street Department re
laying the blocks and inauiries were in
stituted.
The explanation of the Street Depart
ment was that the railroad company had
failed to put its portion of the street'in re
pair after having been notified to do so,
and that the work had been done by City
employes and charged to the companies
using the streetâ the Ferries and Cliff
House and Union street line?.
His books show that 897 feet which
should have been paved by the corpora
tions had been done by the Street Depart
ment, and that the railroads had paid the
City ?10,767 for doing the work.
Three Notable Young Episcopalian*.
Two young Episcopalian clergymen of Now
York City and a young professor from Balti
more arrived on the overland train last night
and have talten apartments at the Occidental.
The Rev. James le Baron Johnson, one of the
party, is first assistant to the Rev. Dr. Hunt
ington, pastor of Grace Church In New York.
Mr. Johnson is on his way to Ponland, where
he is to participate in the exercises of a week
incident to the dedication and opening of a
new Episcopal church, the money for building
which was given by this youthful clergyman.
The Rev. Edward L. Parsons has come to Cali
fornia because of poor health. It seems that
he received some time ago a nattering call to a
prominent pulpit in this State. He may now
decide to remain here after first trying what
Southern California will do for him physically.
John H. Latine, the layman of the party, was
an instructor in the department of philoso
phy at Johns Hopkins University, from wnich
he is a graduate. He has come here to become
a teacher in the Mount Tamalpals Military
Academy at San Kafael.
FOURTH STREET.
Efforts Are Being Made to Have That
Important Thoroughfare Restored
to a Passable Condition.
The Fourth-street Improvement Club
held an interesting meeting at Pioneer
Hall last Thursday evening, President
Sullivan in the chair. Twenty-five new
members joined the club, making the
membership at present 175. Btrong
speeches were made by J. M. Strauss, \
P. H. Cahill and S. B. Nolan condemning
the way Fourth street has been cut up by
the railroad company, the blocks just laid
having sunk from four to five inches. The
street, as it is at present, has seven differ
ent grades, making it impossible for teams
to drive on that thoroughfare; thus work-
Ing a great hardship to the storekeepers,
who depend largely on the traffic on the
street for their living. The dust also was
characterized as unbearable.

NEW TO-DAY.

Whereas, The condition of Fourth street at

great hardship on the bicycle men and

Resolved, That we appeal to the railroad and
Board of Supervisors to bituminize Fourth
street from Market to Folsom, the coat of
which will be about $10,000, and by granting
us this favor they wiu receive the support of
the Bouthside voters.

Inquest Record Broken.
These are record-broaking days at the
Morgue. Yesterday Coroner Hawkins held
ten inquests, the best previous day's work
being seven. It required just two hours and a
half to go through the list, the first inquest
being called promptly at 9 o'clock. The jury
returned a verdict of suicide in seven of the
ten cases as follows: Joseph Frantz, Mrs.
Susie Pinkerton, Jacob Hill, Mrs. Clara Olsen,
unknown man, Jacob Pape and William H.
Wyman. In the case of Morris Holtzman,
aged 15, who died from the effects of an elec
tric shock received in a cloak-making estab
lishment in the Donahue building, the jury
strongly censured the Pacific Motor Company
for not disconnecting the uninsulated wire.
A verdict of accidental death was rendered.
A similar verdict was rendered in the cases of
Herman Fabry, liquor-dealer, and Mrs. Maria
Scott. Both were asphyxiated by gas, the re

DEMOCRACY READY
FOR FUSION,
Committee Appointed to Con
fer With Popu
lists.
THEY WANT HELP BADLY
And Will Be Willing to Give
the Populists All They
Ask For.
ACTIVE WOKK IS SUGGESTED.
Republicans Reported Making a Vigor
ous and Aggressive Campaign
All Over the St^te.
The Democratic State Central Commit
tee held a regular meeting in the Califor
nia Hotel yesterday afternoon and de
eded that it was time for the State De
mocracy to call a halt and to submit to
:he embraces of the pursuer, the People'i
party. In other words, that it was time
:o fuse. This is practically an admission
;hat the Democracy is not confident that
t can carry this State without ue aid of
;he Populists.
W. H. Alforct of Tulare was in the chair,
md tbe first business transacted was the
acceptance ot the resignation of ex-Mayor
E. B. Pond, who could not support tbe
Chicago platform. Mr. Pond's letter of
resignation gave no reason for the step
taken. It was simply a resignation with
out comment as a member of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee.
On motion of Gavin McNab, Clitus Bar
bour was appointed unanimously to fill
the vacancy.
The matter of fusion with the Populists
came up in tbe shape of a resolution pre
sented by the advisory committee reiolv
ing that a committee of seven, of whom
the chairman should be one, should be
appointed for the purpose of consulting
with the duly authorized executive com
mittees of the Populist and silver organiz
ations in the State of California, and re
solving further that such committee re
port back to the Btate Central Committee
the result of the conference on fusion on
Presidential electors, the whole subject
matter to be held in temporary abeyance
until after consultation with the execu
tive committee of the Democratic party of
the United States.
John \V. Mitchell of Los Angeles said
that the matter <nieht involve the candi
dates on the Democratic and Populist
tickets in different districts of the State.
On motion of Caminetti the resolution
was made to include Congressmen as well
is Presidential electors in the fusion.
Mr. Mitchell said that an effort would
be made to nave the Populists of the Sixtn
Congressional District meet at the same
time in Los Anceles with the Democrats.
On motion of M. C. Hassett of San Fran
cisco it was decided that a committee of
five be appointed to co-operate with the
:hair in assisting the different State Com
tnitteemen' in forming clubs in their re
spective districts.
Reports of good cheer were heard from
iifferent counties. J. A. Filcher of Placer |
said that the Democracy must poll its I
rotes for Sewall as weli as for Bryan, and
to that end it would be well to effect
thorough organization without delay,
rhere were several Populists and Republi
cans on the roll of Placer County.
All the speakers urged the speedy organ
ization of clubs and distribution of silver
literature, because the Republicans in each
of the counties reported were masing an
active and aggressive fight.
Ball of Colusa said that free coinage lit
erature wan wanted in order to enable
Democrats to combat the fact that a good
many people believed that free coinage
would have a tendency to cheapen money.
A good many Democrats in his county,
he said, were not weli enough informed on
the matter to discuss it with success.
Hassett of San Francisco remarked that
it had been industriously circulated around
this City for eight or ten days that the
savings banks of this City and State will
undertake to pay off their depositors in
cheap money, namely silver. The law re
quires them to pay their depositors in the
same kind of money as that received by
them.
The committee adjourned subject to the
call of tbe chair.
Among the delegates present was Mark
R. Plaisted, publisher of the Morning |
Enterprise at Riverside, in this State.
W. D. Grady, a well-known attorney |
and Democratic politician of Fresno, has j
taken up his residence in this City. Thus
far he has taken no active interest in local
politics.
AH was quiet at the Republican head
quarters yesterday. Letters continue to
pour in giving Recounts of new conver
sions every day from the ranka of the ad
vocates of cheap money. M. R. Higgins,
secretary of the Republican State Central
Committee, said yesterday that the Dem
ocrats were so badly scared that they
would give the Populists all that they
asked in order to secure their aid.
LOVED IN DEATH.
Orphan Children Follow the Body of
Mrs. .Charle* Fechheimer to Its
Last Resting Place.
Ten little girls, inmates of the Hebrew
Orphans' Asylnm, followed on foot the
remains of Mrs. Charles S. Fechheimer to I
the grave. The tear-stained faces of the
orphans and their solemn demeanor |
showed how generally they felt the loss
of their benefactress.
Of the many estimable Hebrew ladies \
who devote their time and purse to tbe
crtuse of charity, Mrs. Fecbheimer ranted
first as an earnest worker and protector
of tbe distressed. She opened her heart,
her purse, her home to the poor. Her iife
was one continuous chapter of generous
and noble sacrifices.
She was an active and prominent mem
ber of the Hebrew Ladies' Society, the
Hebrew Orp'oan Society, the Sewing So
ciety and tbe Old Ladies' Home. The
estimable lady was the wife of Charles S.
Fechheimer, the pioneer merchant, and
sister-in-law of S. W. Levy, president ot
tbe Associated Charities.
The funeral services were conducted yes
terday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the late
home of the deceased, 1631 Broadway
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger officiating.
The remains were placed in a handsome
cloth- covered, silver - mounted ensket.
There were many handsome floral pieces
tokens from legions of friends and all the
charitable organizations of the City.
The pall-bearers were: S. W. Rosen
stock, Mr. Anspacher, president of the
Temple EmaimEl, Joseph Naphtaly Henry
Wangenheim, Leopold Hirsch and 8. For
mau.
The remains were interred in the family
plat at the Home of Peace Cemetery, San
Mateo.

RUDDELL UNDER FIRE.
The Deputy Surveyor Accused by Mrs.
Dick Williams of a Serious
Offense.
Deputy Surveyor of the Port Sam Rud
dell is again under fire, the charges in this
particular instance emanating from Mrs.
Dick Williams.
S >me months ago Mr. Ruddell was ac
cused of having a hand in the escape of
the Atlanta Chinese. These charges
wereentirely disproved, however, although
Dick Williams, who is supposed to havo
been implicated in the same affair, has
since been indicted and is now awaiting
trial - Â , ._ j.
It now appears that the wife of the de
posed inspector has made affidavit to the
effect that the Deputy Surveyor had
passed for her certain articles subject to
duty. She goes further than this, saying
that Mr. Ruildell had at one time in his
home on Hayes street, rugs to the value of
$20,000.
Tbe Deputy Surveyor, however, is in
clined to treat all such accusations with
silent contempt. "I do not know Mrs.
Williams," he said, "and have never
passed any articles free of duty for her or
any one else. The charges are too absurd
to think of for a moment.''

MEETING OF THE P. A. A.
McArthur's Amateur Standing to Be
investigated aud John Elliot's
Resignation Considered.
A meeting of the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation was held last evening.
Special commissioners were appointed
to look after the different branches of
sport for the ensuing year as follows:
John Elliot, track athletics; W K. Barry,
football ; F.A. Fache, baseball ; W. B. West,
lawn tennis; J. Rothkopf, swimming;
D. Vanering, boxing; D. Brown, bicycling.
John Elliot, J. A. Lenihan, S. J. Pem
broke, J. Rothkopf and J. Nolan were ap
pointed as a regatta committee.
John Elliot's resignation was read, but
it was deemed advisable not to accept it
until a committee had waited upon him
with the intention of having Him recon
sider his action.
The matter of a boxing bout between
George Green and Robert McArthur on
the evening of July 31 was ntxt brought
up.
McArthur had been suspended from the
amateur ranks for taking part in a boxing
bout with a professional where a purse
was hung up.
McArthur is very anxious to remain in
the amateur ranks, and offered in a letter
to explain. Green claimed thai he him
self was to receive all the money, and that
McArthur was simply boxing for his
health, and if Green wanted to give him a
necktie pin he could do so.
Charles J. Bos worth stated in behalf of
the directors that they had nothing to do
with the making of the match, and that
Dr. Short, leader of the club, was instru
mental in bringing the men together.
Finally the association appointed a
committee consisting of Dan Coletnan of
the San Francisco Athletic dub as chair
man, W. R. Barry of the Reliance Club,
William F. Rheinhart of the University,
J. W. Ames of the San Francisco
Y. M. C. A. and William T. Hall
of the Academic Athletic League, to in
vestigate the charges against McArthur
and report at the next meeting.
Samuel J. Pembroke was given his seat
in the association as club delegate from
the Alameda Boating Club in place of J.
Sansom, an opposing candidate.

Burglars Soared Away,
Burglars entered the premises of the Had
wen Swain Manufacturing Company, 215 Main
street, early yesterday morning, through the
rear door. They took a few nickels that were
in the telephone dox, but nothing else. The
probability is that they had been scared away
before being able to operate upon the safe.

ELECTRIC ROAD COMPETITION.
Merchants Are Unanimcus in Pro
testing Against the Change
of Terminals.
Oaklakp Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Aue. 8. \
The Southern Pacific Company is build
ing a new large deoot at the intersection
of the Laundry Farm Electric Railroad,
about three blocks east of the present
Seventh-street terminal at Fruitvale. and
it is reported that the company is to aban
don the stations at Twenty-third avenue
and Fruitvale, and open new one 3at
Twenty-eishth avenue and the junction
with the Launary Farm road. This new
move, if carried out, will work great in
jury to the property-owners at both the
ol(l-establish*Â«l ocnters.
Both at Fruitvale and Twenty-third
avenue there have grown up prosperous
homes and stores, and the various streetcar
lines have run branches into the heart of
them to satisfy a demand for public con
veyances. If a change ia made now all of
this will be worse than lost, for they will
have no approaches to the new depots and
no use for the old ones.
Those who will be mostly affected by
the changes are very pronounced in tneir
opinions. At present the only subject of
discussion at Fruitvale outside of politics
is the question of the change in the depot
facilities.
One of the greatest sufferers, if this plan
is carried out, will be the Oakland, San
Leandro and Uaywards electric line.
They have a swing car running to each of
these depots now. They carry passengers
from High street to the Seventh-street
local for a nickel, and the nickels thus
taken in are numerous. If the line is ex
tended these nickels will all go into the
Southern Pacific Company's hands and
greatly reduce the already losing traffic of
the electric company.
H. I. Kellogg, the druggist, ssys it
seems strange that the Southern Pacific
cannot leave this place in peace. "The
placing of gates upon the local train was
nearly a deathblow to the locality," he
said, "and if this proposed change is made
we might as well give up entirely. I un
derstand that they have purchased a piece
of land between here and Fruitvale for a
depot site."
H. Pascoe, the coal-dealer, is not at all
satisfied with the outlook. He says:
"Yes, I have heard of the proposed change,
but how can they ride over the wishes of
the public in this way? lam surprised
that the peoDle of thii locality will be
bullyragged in such a manner. But
thenâ oh, pshaw, the Southern Pacilic
doesn't care for the people. They at
tempted to kill us once before and now
they will finish the job. It is their in
tention to break down and injure the
Haywards electric road. They are fight
ing for the traffic they lost when it opened
a line through here. This work will kill
business at this point if it is allowed to go
through.
"The people here will not sit by and see
a change made without a huge protest
from us."
I. N. Adams, a grocer, said: "I don't be
lieve that the road will dare make such a
move. Why, it would be the death of both
Fruitvaleand Tweaty-third avenue's busi
ness prospects. The people here will pro
test with all of their strength against any
such work."
Another gentleman, well known in the
locality and an old settler, said: "That
new depot means something surely, but I
nor nobody else knows what. The South
ern Pacific people will do anything in the
world for an extra 50-cent piece. I surely
shall do my share toward opposing any
thing in the shape of a removal of our
depot."
Ex-Governor Blasdel, who lives in the
vicinity, declares that it is an attempt of
the Southern Pacific to injurs the district
already built up to build up a new terri
tory. He is very outspoken on the sub
ject and is ready to lead any movement in
a protest. ______________
A Break That (Til Not Planned.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. B.â Sheriff White
nearly bad & fit to-night when he read in
some evening newspapers a lurid story of
a jail-break that was planned by his pris
oners and into which a few murders were
to be interjected by way of variety. "Here
is the matter in a nutshell," said the Sheriff
to-night. "An old club that I have had
here for a month was taken from the top
of a ceil, and the story was started that
tome concealed weapons had been taken
Some of the Orators Who Opened ttie Populist Campaign in Oakland Last .Night.
from the prisoners. There is nothing more
to the story."
HELENE'S MOTHER.
Sirs. Presoott Believes She Is a Young
Alameda Widow of a Good
Family.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. B.â Mrs. Lydia
A. Prescott.secretary of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, is
satisfied that she Knows who is the
mother of "Little Helene," the waif who
was left for her to care for without any ex
planation last April. Ever since that
date a systematic but quiet search has
been going on to discover whose child she
is.
"In March I received a letter," said Mrs.
Prescott, "asking if we could find a
home for a baby girl. About a month later
the baby arrived. It was ill, but was soon
nursed "back to health, and to-day it is ift
fine a child as you could desire. One day
a young woman called to see a chud who,
she said, she understood we wanted to
have adopted.
"From her eyes I secured my first clew,
and have followed it up until I believe the
baby's mother is a widow of Alameda,
about twenty years of age and of a good
family. She has been separated from her
husband for several years. Further inves
tigation will be made, and I'll know more
within a week."

A PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT
Ghief Krauth Formulates a Plan
to Abolish Alameda's
Volunteers.
The Board ot Health Censures the
Police for Not Enforcing Ordi
nancesâFuneral of W. Wyber.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. B.â "One volun
teer is worth ten pressed men" does not
find favor in the eyes of Fire Chief
Kraut h. He holds that in fire companies
one paid man is worth ten volunteers
from the point of efficiency and discipline.
So it is under contemplation to reorganize
the city Fire Department, and Chief
Krauth has formulated a plan for the con
sideration of the Fire Committee of the
City Trustees. If considered practicable,
it will not go into operation until after
the new tax levy has been fixed in Oc
tober.
The plan, as outlined, will abolish the
present volunteer companies. In their
places there will be three hose companies,
with hose-wagons, located at the Court
street, Webb-avenue and Sherman-street
firehouses, and two hook-and-ladder com-
panics also at the last-named houses.
The force is to consist of a chief en
gineer, two district engineers, eight
drivers, one steamer engineer, five fore
men and thirty extra or call men. The
men will be paid for the actual time on
duty on a scale in keeping with their posi
tions â from $2 to $1 for the first half hour
employed and $1 to 50 cents for each half
hour thereafter.
The expense for last year, including the
fire-alarm system, was $19,351 26, and it is
calculated that the reorganization will
not entail any fresh outlay.
Board of Health.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aue. B.â The health
officer at the Board of Health's meeting
last evening reported six contagious dis
eases for the previous month. The deaths
recorded were twelve and the births four
teen. The annual deatn rate was stated
as 9.36. The veterinary inspector's report
stated he had physically examined 65
cows and found three cases of tuberculosis
and confiscated 100 packages of cream
which be had found on sale since the per
mit had been revolted by the board.
Dr. Lubbock called the attention of the
board to the nejjlect of the Police Depart
ment in enforcing the ordinances relating
to scavengers and the placing of produce
on sale at least two feet from the side
walk. "As acting Health Officer I have
twice asted the police to carry out the
provisions of the ordinance," he said.
"There is no ÃBe in the Board of Health
obtaining the passage of ordinances if
they are not going to be enforced. It is as
much the duty of the police to enforce the
city ordinances as it is to arrest a drunken
man."
It was agreed that the City Marshal
should be officially notified to see that the
ordinances are complied with.
Wyber'i Funeral.
ALAMEDA, Cal., August B.â The re
mains of William Wyber were received
this evening from Angels Camp, Cal.
Wyber met his death yesterday by falling
down the 150-foot shaft of the Utica mine;
Wyber will be buried to-morrow at 2 p.
m. from the undertaking parlors of C. H.
Wever, and the A. O. U. W.. of which or

SPEAKING LOUD FOR SILVEB.
The Populist Mayor Was Not Seen in
His Party's Ratifica
tion.
Oakland Office San Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 8. )
Resplendent in red, white and blue uni
forms the Populists of Alameda County
held their ratification meeting to-night.
The procession that marchea from Fifth
and Broadway along the prescribed route
to Germania Hall was unusually large for
the early stageo of a campaign. It was led
by City Attorney Peirsol mounted on a
staid old charger. His aids were County
Assessor Dalton, Sheriff White, Gus Kock,
W. Matthews, John R. Eliy, M. L. Gray
and F. T. Hale, who were also mounted
and wore attractive tri-colored sashes.
The ZouaTe band followed and played
popular music alternately with the drum
and fife corps, which was dressed in a uni
form suggestive of colonial times.
Then came the Zouaves and the SToung
Men's People's Party Club. The Zouaves
are uniformed in white bloomers, red
vests and blue coats and wore natty caps.
Each carried a torch and more than a
hundred were in line.
Several transparencies were carried, on
which were Populistic mottoes. One read
"Issue money direct from the Govern
ment," another "Where's McKinley;
what's the matter with Tom Watson?"
"Hanna's $10,000,000 fund must not con
trol," was on another. 41 16 to 1" in
various forms was also seen at intervals.
The red-fire wagon was the terror of
nervous women and the delight of the
gamins. It was a long wagon and at one
end was a crude gallows. It resembled a
euillotine as much as a gallows, but its
grewsome effect was the same no matter
which. At the heau" was the motto, "16 to
1," at the bottom a box. When a man
pulled the rope a figure was hoisted out of
the box by the neck, and while a shovel
full oi red fire illumined the outfit "Gold
Standard' 1 was seen dangling from the
gibbet iv the form of a man.
A company of Populists on foot brought
the procession to a close.
It was the cause of much comment that
Oakland's Populist Mayor, John L. Davie,
was not in line.
AT GERMANIA HALL.
Several Orators Seta Forth the
Issues of the Campaign.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. B.â Germania
Hall was well filed with a Populistic
audience, among whom there was a large
sprinkling of ladies. On the platform
with the speakers were seated Susan B.
Anthony, while at her side sat Mrs. Green
Majors, Mrs. Ida B. Harper, Mrs. Lloyd
Baldwin, Miss Winnifred Harper and Dr.
Clara Falkina Young.
The meeting was called together by J.
M. Moore, chairman of the Populist
County Central Committee. He intro
duced County Superintendent of Educa
tion J. P. Garlick as chairman without
any remarks.
In his opening remarks Mr. Garlick said:
This is to be the most momentous campaign
that has ever been seen in this country. It is
to be a campaign of principles and not of men
It js to be a campaign for a principle which
will leave parties and partisans to the rearâ a
campaign in which Republicans will leave
partj for a principle because they believe it is
lor the best interest of the country; a cam
paign in which Democrats will leave the party
because they believe it has left the principles
which they believe to be lor the best interest
of the Nation.
It is to be a campaign of patriotism, one as
far as the Populists are concerned of education
rather than of abuse. The Democrats have
nominated a candidate for President whom we
as a party have seen fit to nominate as our
leader. Now, I believe it will only be the hon
orable thing for the Democrats to nominate
and indorse our candidate for Vice-President
[Cheors and applause.] There has never been
a time when party principles and party ties
were of less account, a time when party men
were considered less than patriotism.
Susan B. Anthony was received with
considerable enthusiasm. She said: "Mr.
President, gentlemen and ladies: I
came to-night to thank you for your sup
port of the principles which I advocate. I
not only desire to thank you, but the en
tire party throughout the State and Na
tion, for ever since the organization of the
patty it has stood for the principle of
equal rights to women and special privi
leges to none, not even to men."
Ihe other speakers were Green Majors,
J. C. Buttner, Taylor Rogers and B. M.
Gibson.
At the Mactionough.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. B.â "The Mas
queraders," which the .ejinpire company
will produce at its opening and closing
> nights at the Macdooough Theater, is de
scribed as one of the most picturesque and
powerful dramas from the pen of Henry
Arthur Jones. As the author of "Saints
and Sinners," "Tne Middlemen," "The
Dancing GirJ," "Judah" and many other
plays of extraordinary attractiveness, Mr.
Jones has taken rank as one of the few re
markable playwrights of the times. "The
Masquerad rs," as viewed in the light of
an unconventional play, was the subject
of incessant discussion durng the course
of its long engagement at the St. James
Theater in London, and also dur
ing its extended run at the Empire
Theater in New York, where it was inter
preted by the Empire company. Its card
cutting scene, in which the heroine is at
stake, is considered by many the most
thrilliug scene that has been put upon the
stage in many years. ,

DOMINATED BY POLITICS,
Heads of Departments Were Dis
charged to Make Room
for Friends.
Mayor Davie Replies in Detail to the
Charges Made by Peirsol
and Wilson-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 8. J
Mayor Davie does not intend to rest un
der the charges made by Mr. Peirsol and
Mr. Wilson, his colleagues on the Board
of Works.
To-day the Mayor issued the following
letter:
I did not intend to pay any attention to
what Mr. Wilson is reported to have said in
the press, as it was not over his own signature,
but when Mr. Peirsol sends to the press a
signed article I must give his statements at
tention and the pubiic the facts.
It is a fact that the Police and Fire depart
ments are being turned into political ma
chines. In proof of that statement Mr. Wilson
admits that members of the said departments
came to him for instruction how to vote and
work in the coming primaries. None of the
members of the departments came to me and
asked how they should vote. Why? Although
I am a member of the Police and Fire Commis
sion. Why?
That Peirsol and Wilson have replaced old
and trusted memoers of the Police and
Fire departments and also of all other depart
ments under their control with their friends
and relatives, who have had no experience in
their respective positions, is true.
That as Commissioner 1 have refused to Bit
and hear charges against certain officers is
true, the reason being that the charges were
groundless and only made to create -a vacancy.
I especially call attention to the fourth
statement of Mr. Peirsol wherein he says no
one has been dismissed without investigation.
That statement is absolutely false, as the rec
ords of tne Board of Public Works and the
Board of Police and Fire Commissioners will
prove. First on the list of removals without
cause is the Chief of Police, Louis Schaffer. one
of the most competent and efficient officers
this city has ever had. This was done in vio
lation of sections 199 and 206 of the city
charter. When asked to resign by Mr. Pier*>ol, I
Chief Schaffer asked upon what grounds and I
Mr. Peirsol replied: "We have no fault to find
with the manner in which you conducted
your office, but the political pressure is so
strong that we must take action."
The Chief of the Fire Department was also
removed without cause or trial. He was a
man of many years' experience in fire matters,
and his place was filled by a a man who had
never had any experience as a member of any
fire department. Also the Superintendent of
Streets and deputies were removed without
trial or Investigation. The chief assessment
clerk, who was known to be competent for the
place, was removed and the position given to a
son of the then editor of Industry, a Mr. Brets.
The outcome of this appointment is known to
the whole city. . .
There are others which I will not mention,
but which can be demonstrated by reference
to the records of the several departments.
What I Bald in connection with the resolu
tion adopted at the last meeting of the Police
and Fire Commissioners, directing the mem
bers not to take part in the politics of the com
ing primaries, was said in an open meeting of
the board, and I repeat what I then saidâ that
the resolution to keep the firemen and police
men out of politics was entirely unnecessary,
as the rules and regulations of the depart
ments prohibit firemen and policemen in tak
ing part in political campaigns. I then re
garded and now regard the resolution as
merely a bid on the part of Peirsol and Wi'.aon
for political affiliation with the candidates
who may come up for election next tall.

present indications it would seem that
there will be more students on the roll
than can be accommodated even to a
reasonable extent. President Kellogg re
marked to-day that he did not know where

will be still more crowded this year than
ever, if the class reaches the 500 mark, as
some of the university people think it
will. We will have to use some of the
university cottages, I presume, for class
rooms, in order that the overflow may be
accommodated.
"The institution is certainly in a very
prosperous condition â in fact, our pros
perity is our misfortune just at this time.
We will have to worry along with what
room we have until the next meeting of
the Legislature, with the hope that they
will appropriate enough money to build
suitable and adequate new structures."
The most impoitant addition to the
university this year has beeji the filling of
the chair of Oriental languages, and the
election to it of Dr. John Fryer, who has
for the past quarter of a century been in
tne service of the Chinese Government as
translator, writer and compiler of books
at the order of the EniDeror. Having had
long experience with the Oninese and
Japanese people Dr. Fryer is considered
to De thoroughly familiar with their man
ners and customs, and is capable of ably
instructing as to their religion, philo-o
phy, ethics and their history. He will
endeavor to arrange the Chinese courses
so as to enable an intelligent student to
acquire sufficient command of the lan
guage in four years to lit him for taKing
ud work in the Chinese consular or cus
toms service. Following are the three
courses which Dr. Fryer has outlined:
First courseâ The spoken language of China.
The Mandarin or court dialect. Tliis is spoken
with more or less mixture of patois by all edu
cated people throughout the empire, and is the
native tongue of all the inhabitants of all the
northern and central provinces. For official
purposes the variety spoken at Pekin is con
sidered the Btandard. The Mandarin has a
literature of its own and involves a study of a
large portion of the characters in ordinary use.
The Cantonese dialect. This is spoKen in the
two provinces, Kuangtung and Kuanghsi, and
is the native tongue of almost all of the Chinese
of America, Australia and other lands. It has
no recognized literature of its own, but in
volves the study of a large portion of the
Chinese characters of ordinary use.
Second course â The written language of
China. Current literature, correspondence,
newspaper articles, including official docu
ment*, etc. Three hours per week at least will
be required for this course.
Third course â The religions, philosophies
and history of China. This course is indepen
dent of the other courses and does not require
the study of the language. At least oue nour
per week will be required for this course.
The establishment of this chair is looked
upon as being a move of no little impor
tance in tne history of the State Univer
sity, because of the fact that in only one
other University in America are regular
courses in Chinese and Jaoanese given,
and because of the ereat and growing
need of Chinese and Japanese speaking
Americans on this coast as a result of the
increasing commercial interests between
the United States and these countries.
Though the Semitic languages taught at
.Berkeley by Dr. Voorsanger come unoer
the bead of Oriental languages, it was the
purpose of Edward Tompirins, who be
queathed the property twenty-four years
ago from which the $50,000 was recently
realized to found the chair, to broaden the
interest especially in the Japanese and
Chinese, as he indicated in the following
section of his bequest:
"The business between California and
Asia is already very great. Its future is
beyond any estimate that the most oan
guine would dare to make. The child is
now born that will see the commerce of
the Pacilic greater than that oi the At
lantic. It is carried on with people of
whose language we are wholly ignorant,
and in all the vast transactions that it in
volves we are dependent upon native in
terpreters, whose integrity will not become
more reliable as the magnitude of their
temptations shall increase. It is there
fore of the utmost consequence for Cali
fornia that the means shall be provided
to instruct our young men preparing for
lives of business activity in the languages
and literatures of Eastern Asia.'*
Several new instructors have been en
gaged in the various departments. Dr. J.
C. Rockwell of Yale has been elected as
sistant Professor of archaeology, in place
of proiessor Merrill, who is away on a

SOLANO'S DECIDED ATTITUDE.

Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 8. )
The County Central Republican Com
mittee met this afternoon and in accord
ance with the recommendation of the
State Central Committee they rescinded
their action of last week regarding the ap
pointment of four delegates at large to the
Congressional Convention. The delegates
will be voted for at every precinct in the
county, and each candidate will name his
own nominees.
One of the arguments made last week in
favor of the election of delegates at large
by the County Committee was that Solano
had done likewise. To-day the fallowing
communication was received from Solano:
The executive committee of the Republican
County Central Committee of Solano County
at a meeting held at Vallejo, on August 3,
1896, by resolution, unanimously resolved to
rescind its action in appointing two delegates
at large from Solano County to the Republican
Congressional Convention of the Third Dis
trict, to be held at Vallejo, August 22, 1896.
and opened its lists for the reception of names
of any and all who desired to become candi
dates for the position of delegates at large
from Solano County to said convention, said
delegates to be voted for at the primaries of
August 15, 1896, as well as other delegates.
You will observe that this action was taken
by our committee before the State Central
Committee recommended the same.
The resignations of the two delegates who
were so appointed by the committee were also
handed to this committee and were accepted.
Yours, truly,
I. J. Lcchmigek, Chairman.
A discussion took place regarding the
manner in which tne names of the dele
gates-at-large should be placed on the
ticket. The matter was straightened out by
the passage of the following resolution:
Senolved, That the representatives of all Re
publican candidates for Congress in whose in
terests delegates are to be voted for at the pri
mary election to be held in Alameda County
on August 15, 1896, In accordance with the
call of this committee, make their nomina
tions for delegates at large to be voted for at
such primaries and hand such nominations to
the secretary of this committee on or before
Wednesday, the 12th day of August, 1896;
and be it further
Resolved, That the County Committeeman
from each ward in the city of Oakland and
from each township or district outside of the
city of Oakland be and he is hereby instructed
to cause the names so nominated as aforesaid
for delegates at large to be placed upon the re
spective ballots of each of such candidates to
be used in every polling-place established for
such primary election and that no other names
for delegates at large be placed upon any of
said ballots.
The committee then presented their lists
of officers and polling-places, and they
were adopted. The arrangements for the
primaries have been made to suit both
parties to the Congressional fight. The
new great register will be ready for the
primaries, which will be held next Satur
day, and there is every prospect of a clean
primary,
Mr. Hilburu and Judge tfrick are both
satisfied with the arrangements, and the
friends of both sides are confident of
securing a majority of all the delegates
that will meet at the Vallejo convention
on the 10th.
BORN WITH THE CENTURY.
Ninety-Sixth Birthday of the Old
est Voter in Alameda
County.
His Long Experience Prompts Him to
Support McKinley and Protec
tion.
Oakland Offices ajt Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Aug. 8. J
George Lowry is the oldest voter in
Alameda County and he has just
celebrated his ninety-sixth birthday.
He has been a voter for seventy
five years. Mr. Lowry ia the father
of Mrs. J. Branin of Haywards, and the
occasion was taken advantage of by his
many friends to gather and extend con
gratulations.
There were many old folks at the Rather
ing, but Mr. Lowry was the only one
whose life dawned with the century. He
was born in Scotland in 1800 and came to
this country in early life. He first located
in Centerville, ai^f after living there for a
generation he moved to San Lorenzo,
where he has several children residing.
He has voted for more than half a century
and his mind is very clear on the times of
1812 and its historic events.
When he first moved to Alameda County
the many valleys were uninhabited and
were the' grazing grounds of bands of
cattle. Since those days towns and cities
have grown up, and Mr. Lowry has de
voted his whole energies to active pur
suits. He has hardly ever figured in poli
tics, but he informed bis friends who were
at his ninety-sixth birthday party that he
is a stalwart follower of McKinley. He
has watched the progress of this Republic
for the greater part of its existence, and he
is convinced that a policy of protection is
the only hope and safeguard for the
future.
Mr. Lowry is in splendid health. His
mind is strong and clear, his eyesight is
good, and be says he will not need a car
riage to take him to the polls on election
day, aa he is a robust pedestrian for hit
age.

GIGANTIC SCHEME
TO LAND CHINESE,
Local Firms Enter Greedily
Into the Proposi
tion.
OFFERED BIG BRIBES.
Chin Wah Maw Makes an
Abortive Attempt to Corrupt
a Federal Oificer.
FULL DETAILS OF THE PLAN.
Men and Women to Be Fraudulently
Landed Through the Port of
San Francisco.
Probably the most gigantic scheme ever
evolved to cheat the Government has just
come to light. It is nothing less than the
wholesale illegal landing of Chinese men
and women.
It ia proposed and in part undertaken
to fraudulently land 260 Celestials at this
port during the next twelve months. For
this service several prominent Chinese
firms agree to pay $100 a head for the men
and $400 for every woman who success
fully passes the vigilance of Collector
Wise's inspectors. Nor is this aIL If the
scheme works well from the start it is
proposed to gradually extend operations
until the whole customs force is involved.
In other wo rds, the smooth-dealing
Chinese are an xious to spend sufficient
money to corrupt the entire local force if
they can only be half way assured that
their brethre n fron> across the sea will not
be asked to produce such trivial things as
registration papers or merchants' certifi
cates.
For audacity this latest attempt of the
almond-eyed citizen to beguile nis white
brother in the interest of his foreign cous
ins is deserving oi more than passing no
tice.
Some ten days ago a little, yellow, shriv
eled-up Chinese. Chin WahMaw by na me,
with more nerve than cutene^s, ap
proached a gentleman high in Federal cir
cles wi'.h a proposition to make, as he ex
pressed it, "Big money." "It is just like
finding it in the road," warbled the Chi
nese, and then, drooping bacK into pigeon
Enplish, added: "You fix-urn certificate;
ruakee heap big money."
The official, however, did not take
kindly to the proposition, though he ap
peared to. Chin Wah was requested to
call later in tbe day, wnen he would be
placed in a way to accomplish the purpose
nearest his heart. Accordingly at the ap
pointed hour Maw appeared and was tnen
introduced to a gentleman as the "one
person in all San Francisco who could ar
range the matter." He was supposed to
be close to the inspectors, and, conse
quently, would have no trouble in landing
as many Chinese men and women as local
parties might find themselves in a position
to pay for.
Chin Wah Maw, highly elated at the
success of his scheme, then arranged for a
meeting between the man who professed
to be able to land Chinese galore and the
men who expected to put up the coin. Last
Thursday night a week ago the first meet
ing occurred at the store of Mow Tuck &
Co., successors to Shew Ching Teong &
Co., 710 Commercial street. On this occa
sion only the formalities oi the scheme
were dibcussad, but everybody appeared to
be perfectly satisfied with tne situation.

ence took place, when all the details of
the plot were gone over. It was agreed to
land 250 Chinese, the sum of $100 to be
paid for every man and $400 for every
woman. Then it was the Chinese showed
their complete familiarity with the Bitua
tion.
They wanted to know of the white agent
if the pictures should be made in China,
or would he see to that at this end. They
were also anxious to secure certificates of
registration and were willing to pay a
little extra for the accommodation. It
was further agreed that no money was to
be paid until tbe Ciiinese were actually
landed, but in the meantime the coin was
to De placed in the hands of Mow Tuck <fe
Co., payable to the white agent thirty
days after the arrival of a China steamer,
it being understood of course that no
money would be paid for such Chinese as
failed to land.
Acting on this agreement Chin Wah ad
dressed a long communication to his
friends in China setting forth tbe facts as
above recorded and further requesting
that three men be sent by the next
steamer. This letter was sect on the
steamer Gaelic and should be nearing its
destination by this time. It is quite likely,
therefore, that on her return trip the
Gaelic will have three passengers who ex
pect to land at the port of San Francisco.
That they will be disappointed goes with
out saying. Tbe scheme has been laid be
fore Collector Wise, and the local Chinese
have be<>n made to feel this. They will
be out the passage money of their cousins
from over the sea, though they are prob
ably thankful at being able to escape so
easily.
There is no law to 6% a conspiracy of
this character. An overt act must be com
mitted before legal proceedings can be in
stituted.
"It is a great pity," said Assistant
United States Attorney Scle'ssinger yester
day, "that the Chinese exclusion act does

as this. An attempt to corrupt a Federal

evidently been in the same business be

MASKED BURGLARS
RAID A RESIDENCE.
Mrs. Sydney L. Marsh Sur
prised by Two Men in
Her Room.
HER LIFE THREATENED.
Captain Lees Exacts Secrecy So
That He Might Catch the
Miscreants.
CHILD CONVULSED BY FEAK.
The Midnight Villians Go About Their
Work In the Coolest Maun-r
Imaginable.
A successful and daring burglary was
perpetrated on the morning of June 26 by
two masked villains, who entered the resi-
dence of Mrs. Sydney L. Marsh, at 2117
Hyde street.
The manner by which the entry was
made, and also the identity of the burg
lars, is as yet a secret. The fact, how
ever, that the entry was made and the
bouse ransacked is unquestionable.
Appearances indicated that the two mid
night vagabonds must have had some
previous knowledge of the wealth of Mrs.
Marsh and that the entry was not made
haphazard; also that they knew that this
lady was alone save for the presence of a
little girl, too young to be of any assist
ance in case the villains should proceed to
do her bodily injury.
The first knowledge Mrs. Marsh had
that there were unwelcome visitors in her
rooms was when her little companion
woke her by saying she beard some noise.
On coming to her senses from a sound
slumber the lady saw between her bed and
an open window the figure of a man. On
asking tbe question who it was, the gruff
answer of a desperate thief came back,
telling her that if she valued her life she
would keep quiet, for an alarm meant to
her a cut th roat on tie same scale as tne
aged Mrs. Langfeldt.
The admonition had its effect upon Mrs.
Marsh, for she kept perfectly quiet while
tbe masked face of a robber was over her
in the bed, while his companion, who was
also masked, went through every room,
carefully examining the bureau drawers,
closets and other receptacles where val
uables would be most likely to be put
away for safe keeping.
Having packed up all tbe jewelry and
valuables to which they took a fancy the
thieves deliberately walked down the front
stairs and out into the street, leaving be
hind them a terrorized lady and a fainting
child.
The little child became no frightened by
seeing two men with masks over their
faces that she went into convulsions, the
effects of which brought on a severe fit of
retching, which did not subside for several
days after, thus leaving her utterly pros
trated.
As soon aa daylight appeared Mrs.
Marsh called her next-door neighbor at
No. 2115 and informed her of what had
taken place. Being a friend of Captain
Lees no time was lost in informing him of
tbe incidents of the previous night.
The captain was absorbed during the re
cital of the story and after having heard all
the details he positively cautioned the lady
that under no circumstances should she
impart to newspaper reporters what had
happened and that no doubt in the course
of a few days the masked burglars would
be binnd the bars and probably her
valuables restored.
Mrs. Marsh observed the injunction, but
tbe booty and burglars have disappeared
without the faintest clew having been ob
tained by the detectives.
TO PURIFY POLITICS.
The Civic Federation Will Probably
Take an Active Part in Municipal
Affairs.
The Civic Federation proposes to purify
local politics. If it cannot be done peace
ably then the organization will resort to
drastic measures.
This much was decided at a meeting of
the executive committee yesterday. The
principal thing now worrying the com
mittee, however, is the correct method of
procedure. Some are in favor of Â» vigor
ous attack on the several parties, while
others advise a more pacific course. All
are agreed, however, that something must
be done.
The committee on local politics, consist
ing of C. B. Perkins, D. Gilbert Dexter,
Colonel Lamoert and George T. Gaden,
made an informal report to the executive
committee. The report went at length
into local affairs political. It deplored the
divided condition of the two old parties,
urging that they either come together
or make room for a party with pure prin
ciples. It deplored the custom of bringing
National affairs into local politics, adding
that municipal matters should not be con
sidered from a political standpoint.
The report wound up with a recommen
dation that all the civic clubs in the City
come together for the one purpose of in
stituting a movement that would have for
its object the indorsement of a pure mu
nicipal government, regardless of party.
Dr. Dille said last night that the Civic
Federation would not indorse any party
or candidate â to take such a step would
be the very undoing of the organization.
He thought it probable, however, that the
individual members would take an active
hand in any movement which claimed for
its object a purer municipality. He fur
ther said the report of the political com
mittee would be submitted to the Civic
Federation at the general meeting to be
held next Friday night, though he did
not think it would be accepted in its pres
ent shape.
ZEALOUS ENDEAVORERS.
What Those Christian Young People
Are Doing for the Cause They
Have Espoused.
The Christian Endeavorers have for a
time felt that the sailors would enioy an
"at home" social, and so last Friday even
ing, under the direction of George Duncan
Jr., chairman of the social committee, and
through the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. J.
A. Hofmann, the first "at home" social
was held at Mr. and Mrs. Hofruann's resi
dence. Several sailors from the ships
Almora, Wasdale and Cambuskenneth
were invited, as well as many prominent
Endeavorers, who all helped to maxe the
evening a pleasant one.
An appropriate programme of song and
instrumental music was rendered, after
which refreshments were served. Among
those present were: Mr. and Mrs. J. A.
Hofmann, E. E. Painter, James Saunders,
P. Huxley, Miss Hofmann, George Dun

BOLD DAYLIGHT ROBBERY
The Residence of J. L. Breyer,
Stevenson Street, Thor
oughly Ransacked.
A Young Han With a Black Mus
tache Was Seen to Enter and
to Leave It.
The residence of J. L. Breyer, 784 Ste
venson street, was entered by a burglar
yesterday afternoon and thoroughly ran
sacked.
Mrs. Breyer left the bouse at 2 o'clock to
go downtown and returned about an bour
later. She was surprised to find every
thing in confusion. The contents of bu
reau-drawers were strewn upon the floor,
mattresses had been ripped open and
searched for money or valuables, and even
a child's bank, containing about $8, had
been forced open and the money stolen.
A gold watch, a silver watch, several rings
and other articles of jewelry were also
missing. In fact, everything in the shape
of jewelry or money was stolen. In his
search the thief even tore the pictures
from the walls and examined the rear parts
to see if anything could be stowed away
there tor safety.
Mrs. Breyer hurried to her husband's
crockery-store on Market street and told
him about the burglary. He at once went
with her to police headquarters and gave a
list of the missing articles.
Some of the neighbors saw a well-dressed
young man with a black mustache insert a
key in the lock of the front door a few
minutes after Mrs. Breyer had left and
enter the house. The young fellow's
boldness took away any "suspicion from
their minds that he was a burglar, al
though they thought it peculiar that a
â tranger should have a key to the front
door. They also saw him leaving the
house and walking away quite unconcern
edly in about half an hour.
The police have received complaints re
cently about a young man answering that
description who had Deen seen prowling
round houses that have been broken into,
and every effort will be made to capture
him.
SEVERED IN WINDPIPE.
Christian Bander, a Despondent La
borer, Tries to End His Life.
Christian Bander, a laborer, 40 years of
age, living at 16 Victor street, attempted
to commit suicide yesterday morning by
cutting his throat with a large table-knife.
He had been out of work for the past
two months, and became despondent, the
more so as his wife had been forced to go
out working to keep them from starving.
About 9 o'clock yesterday morning Bander
went into a back room and cut his throat,
severing the windpipe.
His son a few minutes later saw him
lying on the floor with the blood pouring
from the wound in his throat. Tne boy
alarmed tbe neighbors, who summoned
the ambulance. Mr. Bandpr was taken to
the Receiving Hospital. Dr. Kearney and
Steward Bucher, who accompanied the
ambulance, promptly stopred the flow of
blood, and at the hospital the doctor
stitched and dressed the wound. Bander
was later sent to the City and County
Hospital.
Frank Gilfetber Explains.
Frank Gilfether, brother of Gus Gilfether,
who recently lost his chickens through a de
cision of Judge Low, wishes to deny empnati
caLy that he is in any way responsible for the
trouble. He also denies that Gos Gilfether re
sides at 30 Hlil street, his true address, ac
cording to his statement, being 110 California
avenue. He denies that his uncle made any
will in his brother Gus' favor, but states, on
the other hand, that the property in question
has merely been "signed over" to his mother
during his uncle's absence.
LOTTERY TICKETS
WERE REPUDIATED,
The Story of How Edward
Gressler Lost His
Winnings.
DECLARED TO BE BOGUS.
Purchased in the Company's
Office, hut Said to Be
Spurious.
SINGLE COUPONS ABE SOLD.
How the Public Is Doped Into Buy
ing "Chances" That Have
No Chance.
Ed G resale r's dream of wealth is o'er,
and all because tbe Little Louisiana Lot
tery Company failed to pay tbe prizes
won by tbree tickets sold for the last
monthly drawing.
. Gressler is a City salesman for M. A.
Ganst, the Kearny-street cigar-dealer and
Police Commissioner, and in the course of
his travels comes in contact with many
sporty cigar and liquor dealers who are
in the habit of buying tickets for the lot
tery drawings. He is often asked to take
an interest in batches of tickets and quite
as often is given the coin for a line of
tickets and asked to purchase them when
be finds a dealer.
Just previous to the last drawing of the
lottery Gressler "went in" with a friend
and bought six 25-ccnt tickets, the bits of
papers called coupons being purchased at
the headquarters of the concern only a
day before the numbers were announced.
The alleged winning numbers in the Little
Louisiana are the same as those of the
Honduras National Lottery, the successor
of the Original Louisiana Lottery, and
prizes come about as often as those of the
big concern that was forced out of busi
ness in the United States when tbe Louisi
ana charter of the company expired.
\vhen the result of the drawing at
Puerto (Jortez was announced in the pa
pers that publish' such matters Gressler
was overjoyed. His tickets showed that
be had won the first, second and third
prizes, amounting to $7500, and he imme-
diately prepared to carry out several finan
cial schemes that had been on his mind
for some time. He was in no huiry to
cash the precious tickets, preferring to
show them to friend- as evidence of his
good fortune before they were transferred
to the keeping of the lottery managers in
exchange for $7500 coin of the realm.
Finally, howevar, he presented himself
with a friend at the office of the company
and demanded his coin.
"Just put it up in rolls of twenties," he
said, "and I will put it in this satchel."
The clerk in attendance glanced at the
tickets he presented and took a hurried
trip to the rear of the place where the
powers that control the lottery have their
abiding-place. In a moment he returned
with the tickets, and, tossing them over
the couuter to Gressler, said :
"Those are no tood. They are boeus."
"But I bought them right over this
counter," said Greasier, his face paling aa
the visions of gold faded from his eyes.
"Can't help that," said the clerk, "those
are counterfeit tickets. We have already
paid the prizes to the holders of the
genuine tickets."
Too dazed to expostulate further Gress
ler left tbe place, a sadder but wiser man,
and now he invests none of his bard
earned money in lottery tickets. Since the
payment of the tickets was refused the
cigar drummer has been on a still hunt for
some explanation of the combination of
circumstances that cost him $7500, aa he
figures it.
He claims to have discovered that the
winning numbers in the Honduras draw
ing are telegraphed to San Francisco sev
eral days before the list is published, and
that, in case the winning numbers are not
sold, the tickets are not sold but are held
out and reported as not having been dis
posed of.
If they are sold they are as often de
clared spurious as paid. He believes that
the tickets he purciiased were put on one
side to be held out and were given him
by mistake. One of Gressler's fellow em
ployes in the Gunst establishment went
with him to see why the tickets were not
honored, but got no more satisfaction than
waÂ« accordea the original purchaser.

Why should life be all hurry aod labor? Why should its rush infect even our thinking, and banish peace
from the we -
I believe it was Jesn Paul who told how his father cured him of haste when a boy by telling him this grew
Â«ome tale. He was to go driving with his parents. While waiting for the carriage he was overcome by im
patience and fretted angrily. "My sen, " sai-l the father, "thereis one who is making a house for you. It is
narrow and dark. When it is ready you must enter it to stay there always. As time goes on the nails are
driven in, each nail bringing it nearer to completion. That house is your coffin. He who builds it is called
Death."
Are the hurrying millions of to-day wiser than this child?
.-oath alone, nor mat -yen old age is absorbed in the chase for future good. The present,
alone is ours, is forgotten in the delirium of desire, with the result ib*t gathering years, which should
mellow the heart and ripen judgment, serve only to harden and to em outer.
It is this that makes old age unlovely, not its wtme hairs or bending form. To every season of life is
allof.ed charms of its own. When the golden glow of its meridian is passed and cool shadows gather, there
comes a stillness that is peace. Serener joy* gladden it, a steadier confidence, a more enduring hope. Tire
restless mind, soothed by its calm, falls into reflective mood, and from the experiences of the past learns les
sons of wisdom. A life so crowned is like a Deacon light to storm-tossed mariners upon iiie"s sea, illumi
nating the way and giving assurance of a safe harbor when the voyage is over. A greater dignity belongs to
it than to life's noontide, when man in bis strength goes forth to conquer, for having laid aside desire for
dominance be becomes instead a guide.
sis ;he "honorable old age" that has ever been held as synonym for wisdom. Physical strength and
beauty may leave it, out a tenderer grace will come upon it, as mosses wreath and beautify old trees or
towers that Time has softened with his touch.
One of the loveliest women I ever met had nearly reached life's measure of three score years and ten.
The droop o: her elegant figure could not conceal the hopefulness of her step nor lessen her gentle grace.
A.nd her face was l:ke some sweet dower that the frost . had touched only to give it in fading a more ethereal
beauty. No shadow of discontent lay upon it nor seam of selfish pa&slon. It bore alone the traces of thought,
of kindness, of peace.
Is a beauty that in some measure all old age should possess. Even though it must wear th*Â» marks
- struggle it anould have at east the 3erenity that comes with its cessation. It is pitiful enough that
aged hands should labor at tasks fitted only for the strong, but far more pitiful is it that age should compete
with youth in folly and in strife. A Mrs. Skewton, living on the breath- of Sattery or a white-haired miser
jto his gold are abortions 0.l nature. They have never entered the stream of true life at ail, conse
quently have passed into decay. Their oid age is not the rounding of a life. It is the blighting of a purpose.
In lesser decree this is the result of nearly all modern living. Tue struggle for bread, or for worldly
rewards, a maintained to the end, modified only by a possible increase of attention to physical needs. Bat
man is . ua> being whose mind should override matter; he is a soul who should direct his mind.
To give atteni.on to material things alone, therefore, is to willfully dwarf his own higher nature. As intel
lect grows by exercise in the world of ideas, so does character unfold by reflection. By calmly weighing
rienee we test its value, and learn 6y degrees where to prune and where to cultivate.
Of course a weU-ordered life takes note of all these things; but, just as the twilight hour invites to
retrospect and to reflection, so does the evening of life. Laying aside active duties man sinks into his
- self. So clearly does nature indicate the method of her work with man that only indifference can
blind him to his needs. Or is it that he has come to believe in the physical life only?
The Brahmans of India have for centuries maintained a custom that is evidently intended to give an
equal chance to the various factors of man's three-fold nature. One-third of life they devote to education,
1 to family and world, y duties, an I the remaining span maybe devoted to contemplation and the
knowledge. Tnis custom certainly has the advantage of secariag to old age a well
prepared peace; a season not to be used for mere drowsy enjoyment, bat for winnowing the grain from chaff
.arrested experience.
It is a common habit to speak pityingly of the aged. Is it because they are nearing the close of a life
tfcat seerus to us so very desirable? Or is it because we have a half perception of the fact that in our modern
civilization there is little room for the play of powers that are distinctively their own?
A noted preacher once declared that youth is "the valley of the shadow of deata/" He cited its glowing
hopes, doomed so generally to disappointment; its fervid desires that would pale into bitterness, its higa

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
What Gauses
JWerty ar\d tKe Way It
Mail Be Cured
Is poverty the natural order of thines? There can be but one answer to that.
Poverty is not the natural order. God did not iutend that poverty should exist. It
is entirely artificial. The natural state is that every one should hare enough. That
| poverty should be so common, that the rich should constantly heeorne richer while
the poor are growing poorer, is due to a false system and to bad laws. The Mai
, thusian theory, which is in essence the idea that there are too many people in the
: world and that poverty must increase and that 'the way u> diminish the population
:is to stop bearing children, has iong been discarded. The earth contains sufficient
resources to provide not only for those who are now living on the earth, but also a
much larger population. Consequently the Malthusian teaching has generally been
adjudged to be absurd and monstrous.
Henry George in "Progress and Poverty" has pointed out that the Creator has
provided amply for every human being. There is enough even considering improved
machinery and all that is implied by that. The great trouble is the iniquitous system
of landlordism. Enormous tracts are held unused for speculative purpc*es, and they
are only nominally taxed. While, for instance, the poor farmer improves his barn
and is taxed accordingly, his next neighbor/who holds 1000 acres of land unimproved.
is taxed very little. It does not require any extended argument in view of the general
; growth of intelligence and the wider acceptation of the teachings of Henry George to
â  convey cleariy the idea that this system is a serious hindrance to industry. It ties
up resources which need development.
Its operations are even-worse in cities, where land values and consequently ground
rents are created by the inhabitants and the city built up, but the whole of theseenor
mous values is tajten by those who as landlords do notuing for their creation, and
when a city wants and owns ?.ts water or light works its citizens must pay heavy in
terest on bonds to get them, when the cost should be wholly defrayed by taxes on the
ground value owners who reap the main benefit. Meanwhile a large proportion of the
industrious citizens must live in slums and alleys, debarred from air and sunlight
thst a few may live in palaces. Others are driven into vice and crime, directly or in
directly, because landlords absorb the earnings of labor to an extent that prevents the
masses from purchasing supplies for their physical, intellectual and moral necessities.
All monopolies are based upon land. This is true even of the Standard Oil monop
j oly which may be cited for purpose of illustration. If the oil wells owned by and con
l trolled by the Standard Oil Company were taxed fully, it is very evident that the
I monopoly could not continue to exist.
Herbert Spencer has pointed out that there are no rational ethics in land ownership
under the existing conditions. But it should beciearly understood that the advocates
of the single tax, tnat tax to be placed on land values only, do not propose to cut up the
I land into small pieces for ownership. That would be of no avail because the small par
> eels would speedily find their way back, as laws now are, into the same Hands or at
least would be in the hands of a few. so that nothing of value could be effected by any
; such plan. The proposition of the Single-taxers is to make the rental valuation of
iand the basis of taxation and to exempt improvements and personal property from
> taxes.
The holder of land does not create its value. The enhancement is due to the
community which surrounds the land with improvements and institutions which
increase its desirability for use. From this it follows equitably taat the community
and not the individual should profit by the increased income which is made possible
by the community. If the single-tax system were in vogue In all parts cf the Cnited
States, as it Is partly in New Zealand and as I believe it will be in Delaware, conditions
which now promote the unequal distribution of wealth would not thrive as they do at
this time.
Land which is now held in the iron grip of private ownership, for speculative pur
poses oniy and which does not contribute to the welfare of mankind, would then be
thrown open for use. It may also be set down as truth that no man would work for wages
which would not equal what he couid earn from the land. There is no basis for any
assertion that poverty is a divine institution. Nor can any doctrine growing out of
any such assertion be successfully upheld.
The solution of the poverty problem does not consist in elaborate schemes
requiring intricate legislation. The real need is not for the State to give or guarantee
people employment, but to remove the artificial obstacles which prevent people from
employing themselves by the application of labor to natural resources from wnich
they are now locked out. These obstacles can be removed by the single tax. When
they are even partially removed, as by the Pingree plan, still more by the Murray
River co-operative settlements. South Australia, on land owned and obtained by the
Government, it is a matter of positive fact that no difficulty would be experienced in
self-support, with full and free access to the land. And these experiments are ham
pered to an extent that would not exist under the single tax. They prove that what
is needed to remove poverty is not coddlirg regulatiDn, but freedom and eqaa;
rights to ail, economic as well as political, the abolition of privilege and the enthrone
ment of service as alone entitled to the product of industry. James H. Babbt.

TKe Successful Mar\ or
Wonr\ar\ ir\ Life
What constitutes t be successful man? What are the elements of success? These
are rather abstruse questions, it seems to me, as no two men might agree on the
first proposition, t. ough aL might have more or less harmonious opinions on the
latter.
For instance, a burglar might succeed in making a series of pocket-enriching ex
' peditions witbom finding himself behind the stee; ban of a cell as a reward for his
â¢ ambition. As be chuckled to himself in a downtown resort, with the musical tinkle
' of the coin in his trousers ringing in his ears, he would doubtless deem himself a
success, compared with which Abraham Lincoln was fit only to rank in tii9 second
class.
However, I take it that the term ' 'success in life," as used la the broad, general
sense, means that success which not only satisfies the ambition of the immediate
actor, but also adds to the sum of human happiness.
The elements of success are innate in every human being, and in one sqpse all
are created equalâ not all created to be lawyers, physicians, preachers, or, in fact, to
follow any profession at all, bat created with an equal capacity for some special work.
Society can no more do without the scavenger than the statesman. The function
of the one is to remove the causes that lead to the breeding of disease germs, and of
the other to educate the people to avoid the path that leads to anarchy and conse
quent chaos.
Success, I take it, lies in the attainment of the individual ideal. A man may be a
success in his own opinion, and yet not be so regarded by his feilow-men. The loftier
his ideal, as considered by the ma-s of educated mankind, the less conservatism is
manifested in his recognition as a factor of society.
It is work that makes the man. Occasionally bright, intellectual stars rise above
the horizon and electrify the world with tne sparkling rays of genius, but ere they
attain the zenith their scintillation suddenly ceases and they disappear even beyond
the range of the telescope. Work must not cease when success is attained ; it requires
patient toil to remain at the top of the ladder. To dignify labor one must blend true
aristocracy oi mind with democracy of the body.
That tree is the sturdiest which has withstood the severest storms. The effect of
its swaying has been only to root it more firmly in the soil. So it is with man. How
ever much he may be swayed by the breezes of popular opinion, let him not lose sight
of the fart that he has a gca! in life, the picture of which .always before bis mental
vision should spur him on to greater efforts.
A man must have a high ideal, whether he attain it or not. He may fall far from
realizing his ambition, ana yet in the eyes of the world be deemed a hero. Napoleon
never realized his cherished desire to see French arms dominate the world, but no
man would care to make the rash assertion that as a warrior he was a failure.
Virgil was so diaappointed with his JSneid that on his deathbed he expressed the
wish that, as he couid not live to revise it and brine it up to the literary plane on
which it snouid rest, it might be destroyed. The JSueid survives him. however, and
from it Virgil's name is rendered immortal as the most graceful and polished of Latin
versifiers.
My idea of the successful man is he who realizes that he is only one brick in thÂ»
vast structure of humanity, and has no schemes of self-aggrandizement by
which his fellow-men will have the bloody sweat wrung from their brows;
he who has not enough of tM world's goods to keep his mind worried with
business complications and yet posesses enough to permit him to live in comfortable
circumstances; be who, while be is engaged in the affairs of life, stills nnds time in
some wav or other to add to the sum of human happiness; and, above all, the man
that can go home at the close of his day's labor and find rest and peace in his domestic
life. A loving wife and healthy, laughing children are the best promoters of mental
tranquillity with which an all-wise Providence has endowed our world.
G. W. Daywalt, M.D.
ideals that the world would so ruthlessly demolish. "Later years will bring their
burden of pain, 1 he said, "but never such keenness of anguish as is suffered when we
are young."
That there is some tnath in this view all observers of human emotion will be in
dined to admit. The activities of middle age distract attention from the blows we
i may receive, and solace is found in whatever philosophy of life we have been persuadd
to adopt. Old age calmly accepts inevitable results, pondering their meaning. In
clining to reflection it extracts the honey from all experience, whether good or cvii.
â  Each has a lesson of wisdom to impart. Why then fret about troubles that have ben
'â  efited mind and character? Why any longer desire pleasures that tempt bat to dis
j appoint ? Peace settles upon the soul like mellowing sunshine, and in that peace is
! ripened the fruitage of life.
An old age to which peace is a stranger is abnormal. It is like work without
; rest, or like day without night, that leaves no time for nature to work on the other
side of her sphere. In her economy there is no pause when activities cease, for they
are immediately transferred to another field. In the same way do our own energies re
j treat within when we withdraw t!.em from outward activity. Toreflect is to call the
\ mind home from its wandering, that it may exercise itself in pure thought. It is to
\ turn the stream of life inward where results are stored. In no other way can they
j become a part of ourselves, or aerve to strengthen character. And only when the
tomult of liie baa yielded to peace can reflection do its perfect work.

Under present-day methods, education tends to develop intellectual insight and the power of md*>
pendent thought. There is a remarkable contrast between the methods of to-day and those of twenty,
or even ten, years ago. Instead of standing with open textbook before a class of puzzled children,
the intelligent teacher exemplifies a subject to eager and even enthusiastic pupils, who respond quickly and
happily by virtue of their impressions, and who exhibit an eagerness to do that which their own minds
evolve, not from any tei.'ing, but from a real understanding; the children grasping at knowledge as it cornea
;o them, and developing for themselves the thought needed in their educational advancement.
Now, when a child enters the public school from a kindergarten at six years of age, he has quite a lot
of knowledge of value to begin with. He already possesses the idea of color, form, number?, etc, and is
easily taught to do what he can see for him>elf is needed in his progress onward.
Textbooks, of course, are now only supplemental to the good teacher. For example, in the teaching
of language, no textbook is placed in the bands of the pupi! until he is about 10 years old, and yet in tiie
meantime composition and letter-writing reaches a very creditable stage.
Illustrative drawing, in connection with composition, is also a notable feature nowadays, and the
productions of the young pupils of our schools show some really wonderful results.
Technical grammar is almost a study of the past lor young children. Language has become a most
pleasant study. It means correct speaking, composition and an introduction to literature adapted to the
ages of the children, and all this without the conjugations, declensions, rules, etc. that formerly occupied
a large part of the time of young pupils without yielding them much special benefit in the matter of speak*
ing or wrian^ the language correctly.
In arithmetic practical means have been adopted. The memorizing of long and ambiguous rules is
no longer deemed easeutiaL The quantitative relations of things is the idea in teaching this branch of
study.
In fact, correlation of ideas, in connection with all subjects taught, is now considered the most
rational method. In the main, the essence of good instruction is to train the young to think and to de
velop for themselves under the euidance of intelligent instructors. The popular scaeme of education is one
that will enable children to meet the responsibilities of life and to successfully combat difficulties by the
use of good judgment â a result of habits of correct thought, and of doing that which the hand dads to do
faithfully and welL
Some of the best talent in the land is to-day being devoted to the praiseworthy object of assist*
ing the cause of education by writing for children books full of interest; books that children will take de
light in, and which, at the same time*, tell in simple style important fac:s of history, or expi&in geographical
questions, or illustrate things in natural aistory. Even the cia -sics have been reduced, to some extent, to
stones readily intelligible to the child; and a little boy or girl may now go out of the primary school with
as fair an idea of the chief characters of mytaology as children are wont to have of that famous nursery hero
'Jack the Giant-killer.' There are books of mechanics, also, adapted to the use of cnildren, and stories of
astronomy that give the little ones an insight into seme of the mysteries of the sphere. The various studies
have been relieved of their dryness, and are now made attractive, and children are coming to regard the
school pret;y much in the light of a hall wherein taere is spread a feast of good things for the mind.
Just as in some of your athletic games, wherein nroficiency com*s from practice aaJ not from
memorizing rules, as soms educational writer has observed, so in school life young children acquire knowl
edge oi a branch of study most read.ly through imitation and practice.
The primary education of the child has been receiving some of the consideration that its great impor
tance demands. Parents are taking more interest in the work of the schools than ever before: the standard
of teaching has been steadily raised, and teachers now deal with the youngest pupiis upon purely rational
principles. Nowadays a child learns double as much in half the time, and with hardly any of the mental
strain that was common where little ones had their lessons "drilled into them" long ago. It is reasonable
that parents should seek for their children the best training by the best teachers in the most scientific man*
ner. If a man wants a horse trained, he puts it in charge of a professional trainer who fully understands the
animal's nature and requirements. If that man deems the proper development of the minds of his own
children of equal importance, he does not intrust the work to a domestic, but interests himself in seeing that
:hey are placed where their training will be carried on in accordance with the most approved methods.
Our public schools to-day are making splendid progress in the march toward an ideal educational
system. M. M. Mcrpht.

Weird JMelodies of a Strange NeW Mexican people, NoW tke Fad ir\ JMusical Gircles
Throughout musical and scientific cen
ters in the East a new interest has been
created in the weird, fascinating songs of
the Zuni Indians through a wholly un
looked-for medium. These same songs
had been taken on a phonograph by mem
bers of the Hemen way expedition purely in
the interest of science, and so far only one
musician has succeeded in transposing
them in accordance with the rules of har
mony. Even the Zunian music received
no attention except from students of efh
nology. It remained for a young lady,
and a San Franciscan at that, to bring the
songs and melodies of these interesting
people of New Mexico before the public.
Eastern papers aud musical journals
have contained many flattering notices of
this young woman's novel concerts. Bhe
appears in costumes of different nations
and sings songs which she is popularly
supposed to have learned from the strange
people of the Midway Plaisance at the
Columbian Exposition.
At least such is the impression this en
terprising singer has allowed to go abroad.
Like the grotesque fadâ the decadenceâ
now sweeping over the art of painting ana
designing, those unique performances have
a fascination for musical and cultured
people and their introduction has caused
a stir at the other end of the continent.
The young lady is well known here in so
ciety and literary circles, and she is none
other than Miss Viva Cummins, the daugh
ter of Mrs. Ella Sterling Cummins.
Miss Cummins wa3 a pupil of Professor
Carlos Troyer in this City for years. She
studied his arrangement of Zunian and
other music of a similar character, and
sines at least two Zunian songs, which he
received from Professor Frank H. Cush
ing, director of the He menway expedition,
who learned them while living among the
Zunis. When Dr. Cushing was in San
Francisco regaining his health after years
of hardship in New Mexico, he delivered
one of the most interestinz lectures ever
given before the Academy of Sciences,
and it was then that he met Professor
Troyer, the librarian of the academy.
He sanp the wonderful songs that were until then unknown to civilized ears â songs
he had studied and imitated in the dreary, sunburned homes of the Zunis. Nothing
like these melodies bad ever been heard before. It was not strange that the depth of
mystery, the singular force of expression and the absolute novelty of this music fasci
nated the musician. Professor Troyer saw in the songs qualities suggesting a primi-

Architecture is not San Francisco's strong point. That has
been said over and over again. The long gray lines of stupid
gray repetitions that present themselves from every hilltop or
that pass in review with every nickel's worth of streetcar riding
that men do make it unnecessary to say it at all.
But in this season of Roentgen rays and such things there
has appeared with the suddenness of a discovery almost break
after break in the dull lines that are refreshing to a degree and
that fill the heart with hope.
No city in the Union might compare with San Francisco for
picturesqueness if her citizens availed themselves of her natural
offerings. That, too, bas been said once or twice, and likewise
to the man with appreciation in his heart and a little fancy in
his eye it need never have been said at ail.
Ah, these hilfs and slopes and peaks and the prospects from
themâ what opportunity they offer to the architect. And just
now the architect is getting up here and there suggestions of
these possibilities in the form of residences and semi-public
buildings. A few young men in that line have within the past
very few years begun to think while they work, with a result
that inspires every citizen of San Francisco with the enthusiasm
of a promise of its ultimate redemption.
The man who to-day rides over any of the streetcar lines that
climb tbe hills will be well repaid in what he may rind archi
tecturally among these breaks in the dull gray lines.
This without regard to the mansions of the City. The man
sions co without saying. Some few of these do not come within
the new era. Some of them are quite old, comparatively, and
serve as monuments to a prodigal and past era of ready money
The City has its full share perhaps of substantial palaces
that have been builded year by year. They are expected to
represent such architectural display as money everywhere can
buy. They are worth seeing, of course, anyhow. But not all of
them by any means are beautiful. Some of them it must be
admitted are even vulgar extravagances; others are noble and
imposing and all that they should be. But in any case they
form little part of this story. This has reference to that which
is newâ the more or less unexpected, the manifestation of
thought and good taste in the building of the average home.
For instance there stands at the top of the first rise of Cali
fornia street, on the left going west and at the corner of Taylor
street, the house of the late A. N. Towne. It is a simple
idea in white and brown. The style is something on the line of
the colonial. The first story is built of Roman brick, with mar
ble entrance and portico. The upper story is frame, painted the
whiteness of the marble. This is a latter-day house, but was
among the first to break the leaden spell. It had, therefore,
much to recommend it to San Francisco. As showing the way
toward better things it may be credited with much of the
reformation that has made mis article possible. It was de
signed by the late A. Page Brown and was his earliest successful
production in residences.
At the corner of Webster and Broadway W. E. Bourne is
building an attractive residence. The style is a mixture of
Italian lenaisaance and Flemish. The building is not nearly
completed, but it will form a feature of its neighborhood.
Standing in the sand almost alone out on Sacramento street,
almost opposite the Children's Hospital, is a queer building
that awakens the curiosity of everybody that comes within
its viewi It hardly has a place in a list of new-era residences,
for it is not a residence, but an artists' studio â the studio of
Bush & Walker, scenic painters. Tbe artists needed a wide
wall space, and put up the structure to secure itâ a plain,
square frame house, with a freakish but artistic front. The
style is oriental, suggestive of hotter weather than obtains in
this City. It is not the heavy stone or adobe that it looks,
however, but plain concrete and plaster. The creation repre
sents the combined genius of the. artists themselves and the
architect Tbeo Laist.
A beautiful residence in gray stone bas just been completed
for Mrs. George W. Gibbs at 2622 Jackson street. It is a plain
square sbructu/e without embellishment of any kind. Tbe
handsome entrance is marked by a portico semi-circular in form,
supported by stone pillars. The roof is a feature in itself, done
in Spanish tile, the roof of the portico being the same.
The new residence of Mrs. J. Nash Scott Brown, at the corner
of Jackson and Pierce streets, is built of rough brick, with
English tile roof. It is devoid of any ornamentation and from
Jackson street looks almost forbidding in its simplicity. The
"trades entrance" is on that side. The entrance on Pierce
street is tbe one bit of ornamentation to the building. It is in
ciiasert gray stone, with lantern overnangmg and stone shield
above. The lower windows on this side are decorated with
artistic iron grating. The whole is in Elizabethan style. The
architects are Coxhead & Coxhead.
The same firm are the authors of a unique structure at the
corner of Washington and Lyon streets, a stable belonging 10
John M. Cunningham. It is shingled outside, intensely Eng
lish in treatment, with a clock on the tower and ornamental
wrought iron grill with lantern over the entrance.
John D. Sprockets is building a magnificent residence in
red stone at Van Ness avenue.
In the coarse of bis lecture Dr. Cusbing
sang several Zunian melodies. The notes,
as far as such tones could be recorded by
musical notation, were thereupon taken
by Mr. Troyer, who declared thathecoold
adapt them to our system of music. "It
is impossible," was the exclamation of the
eminent archaeologist, on being told that
the Zuni songs could be recorded. "Many
musicians have declared it beyond the
scope of civilized music to reproduce the
singular intonation and inflections, and be
sides there are fractional tones not known
in the chromatic scale."
But the musician persevered, and suc
ceeded in transcribing and harmonizing
the "Zunian Lullaby" and the "Zunian
Lover's Wooing," which he dedicated to
Dr. Gushing. They were played for his
benefit, and at once Dr. Cashing pro
claimed them perfect. And now these
songs are part of the papers of the Hemen
way expedition in the Smithsonian Insti
tution, and preserved in the archives of
the bureau of ethnology.
The Zunian words were translated into
English by Dr. Cushing, but were never
published. They give a fair idea of the
character and spiritual leanings of the
Zunis, being full of dignity and expres
sive of exalted thought, one toward their
deities, the other toward their women.
In the ''Lullaby" a Zunian mother calls
for protection in most beautiful language,
forgetting self and placing her offspring
under the care of the sun and moon gods.
Some difficulty was met with in attempting
to convey the idioms, translated as "spirit
Jiving, spirit resting," which in Zunian
thought are the "rislnj? sun of life," and
the "setting spn of rest" â very picturesque
and beautiful symbols. As a glimpse of
Zunian character the song is worth giving
in Dr. Cushing's words.
The Lullaby is sang in the weird strains
of an incantation, rising and falling even
in single notes, yet soft and dreamy, for
it is inspired by the tenderness of mater
nity. The transcriber directs that it mast
be sung "with great emotion and deli
cacy," which, in briefest language pos
sible, explains tbe song.
Quite a different view is given by the blanket song which tells of a custom
among the youthful Zuni lovers. The singer approaches tbe house of his hopes at
nighttime wrapped in his blanket and serenades the object of his affections in a
respectful if not. indeed, a chivalrous strain. He asks if she will walk with him
under bis blanket, but does not dare to address her in tbe second person, for that

is part of Zunian beiief. The Zunis do not say to each other "Will you?" or "Do
you?" bat epeak indirectlyâ "Will she?" or "Will he?'- and this is illustrated in the
song as one of the striking characteristics of the race.
Should the maiden favor the swain by accepting his flattering invitation and
walk with him onder one blanket it is regarded as an acceptance of his suit but if
she fail to leave her house he wanders away in the Bight only to repeat his acre-
nade at another time. The most trouble
some obstacle encountered in trans
cribing the Zunian music was, per
haps, in tbe idiomatic cadences run
ning through all the notes. And yet
this same feature gives to Zunian musio a
decided singularity altogether unique
from a musician's point of view, but fall
of a weird coloring that constitutes much
of the charm possessed by these melodies.
Heard for tbe first time a Zunian song has
a peculiar if not an uncanny effect. The
singer begins on a note in a whisper and,
dwelling upon It, increases its intensity,
and then shades it back again to a mere
breath. In this guise the serenade of the
Zuni lover becomes a plaintive, appealing
song. And so, indeed, it is with all the
songs of theae odd people.
They sing to their deities and about tbe
fairest things in nature, that inspire
them to attune their souls to a harmony
which," in spite of its customary weird
ness, has a fair share of beauty.
Though some of their songs are not
ancient they are undoubtedly purely In
dian melodies, little modified by Aryan
influences, and as such these fragments
arejnteresting as musical expressions of a
primitive people.
It is not at all likely that Zunian music
may ever strike a responsive chord in the
popular ear, though its introduction in
fashionable concerts has served to bring to
light melodies hitherto unknown to the
musical, and now preserved as scientific
records through the efforts of a San Fran
cisco musician.

Pining for a little excitement I entered
a restaurant where a waitress was wanted
and offered my services. It was almost
diflner-time. The proprietor's frau looked
me over with her dull, stupid eyes and
said, "Go to Tina; she'll tell you what to
do."
Tina was the head waitress, a weary
looking girl with dark rings under her
eyes, a frowzy head and mourning garb.
A rival assistant, petite, fair and timid,
had already presented herself, and Tina,
after a trial, was to choose between us.
Through the swinging doors into the
dark anteroom, with its heaps of bread,
vegetables and groceries, and on to the
sultry, crowded kitchen, where four pairs
of masculine eyes peered at me through
clouds of steam. My brain was reeling
with endless directions, prices of dishes
and rapidly succeeding orders.
â¢'Twice on the pot- pie, once on the roast
pork, liver on the side!" I called out
triumphantly, and, reaching over my
rival's shoulder for a pile of cups and
saucers, I approached the great smoking
range, whereon stood two copper cal
drons of tea and coffee, with burnished
spigots, and beyond them innumerable
seething kettles, pots and pans.
My orders were filled, and I had come
back with four or five more.
"Hold on, girleel" called the pantry
boy. "Here's your bread for those first
orders."
The blood mounted to my cheeks.
"My name is Miss Ella, if you please!"
I retorted curtly, snatching up two plates
of butter to crown the tower of bread,
and wiping up the gravy that bad poured
from a tilting platter in my other hand.
"Well, I â cr â excuse me," replied the
youth, blushing, "but that's what we
always call em. I guess you'Jl have to
get uaed to it."
And so I did, for both the cooks and
the dishwasher used the endearing term
with perfect impartiality and spared
themselves the trouble of learning new
girls' names.
Backward and forward we rushed,
screaming our orders, flinging aside stacks
of soiled napkins, broken bread and half
eaten victuals, and clattering the great
clumsy dishes until the din was frightful,
and if George, the second cook, had not
been very tail and very easy-;oing, he
would have been quite overwhelmed by
the confusion of our demands and our
persistent appropriation of each other's
viands. His eagle eye and long arm pre
sided over what momentarily threatened
to become hopeless chaos.

rine alike belong to the Tar family. A
Jarge family it is, and in common with all
families of size it contains many types.
And the social status of Jack Tar varies
somewhat, but until he gets a handle to
hiÂ« name there is no danger that "society"
wiil trouble itself about him. The family
is lumped together under the name of
sailors, and classed as amphibious animals
of no account except to sail ships and
I the profits of water-front grogshops.
He is tbe sojourner of a night, and the
problem is to get all his scanty wages in
a^ short time a? possible.
W.ai does Jack slave for if not to bene
fit his iriends who make life glorious for
him during tue tirst three days after he is
paid off? It is pleasant to have his back
stroked, to hear the coaxing "Come,
pussy. puÂ«sy," ami he forgets the "Scat!
you bejist!" that will follow when his
mnney is gone.
It is not because of innate depravity
that Jack gets drunk and wild on shore.
It is reaction. It is striking the average,
finding the mean temperature of life.
There is only monotony in the life of a
sailor on a lone voyage. Work that is
never done, that comes with the coming
of every day, and tbat he knows will
come as long as be is on the deep; food
tbat never varies; an utter lack of per
sonal freedom, and a firm check on origi
nality.
It is not to be wondered at if, when
loosed for a few days or weeks, after
months or years of such life, Jacfc seeks
noise, lawlessness, and reckless freedom.
He finds it.
To welcome him there stand at the
landing the rum-seller, the gambler, and
the woman of the dark. They love Jack.
They remember him from voyage to voy
age and welcome him with beaming eyes
whose light dazzles the sailor lad and
blinds him to their gaping pockets.
And Jack is not a miser. On tbe con
trary Jack has a magnificent disregard for

"This is a queer-looking mess! Dog

bouse you had in the establishment."
"Never mind, 1 ' said a mild, maternal
voice across the room, as I hastened to ef
fect the proper exchange. "Bertie likes
this-just as well."
Bertie grinned and renewed his fatal at
tack unon the porterhouse with such gusto
that I fled in despair to the ice-water tank.
The epicure had a thirsty expression, and
another beefsteaK would not be forthcom
ing for nearly ten minutes. The glass ran
over, and a dry-goods clerk observed quite
audibly:
"I guess we're left this trip; that butter
hasn't come yet."
"What's the trouble here?" demanded
the proprietor, swooping down upon me
with a forgotten dessert for an old lady,
and Tina hastened to the rescue by appro
priating the tardy corn batter-cakes for
one of her own tables. The blue-eyed
"giriee" smiled in compassion.
"Don't get excited!" said a new cus
tomer with a ferocious mustache, as I
darted wildly toward him in an effort to
retrieve my reputation. "Don't get ex
cited. I'm not a crank, and you'll only
make matters worse if you get so con
fused."
And he began complacently to peruse
the bill of fare, while I went back to order
more corn batter-cakes and then took them
to a man who wanted buckwheat cakes.
"He seemed quite satisfied," I apologet
ically explained to the watchful proprietor.
"Yes; but perhaps the first gentleman
wasn't."
"To be sure!" I reflected, remembering
the epicure, when my eye fell upon the
picturesque youth in the corner.
"My dear young lady," he murmured,
with an air of well-bred resignation,
'would you mind bringing me a fork or a
spoon, or something with which I might
eat this salad?"
"1 beg your pardon !" I cried, rushing
away in consternation, while Tina calmly
gathered up the dirty dishes I had left be
hind and took three orders at the same
time.
"Blackberries coming up!" announced
the proprietor cheerfully, slapping down
two dishes of them on the counter ia re
sponse to the Dutch boy's demand.
"Coming up light away!" echoed that
individual to his impatient customers,
and speeding down the aisle like a steam
engine be waved me aside with a flourish
of hisdishtowel and a patronizing grimace.
"Why do you go into the kitchen
empty-handed so often?" asked the pro
prietor, passing me the next moment with
another stack of dirty dishes. "And you
made a mistake on those last two checks."
This reminded me that four other people
were waiting for checks and that he prob
ably had to cast up accounts with several
of my earlier customers himself if they

I had received a beating, but I would not
give up just yet. I would show Tina that
schoolma'ams were not altogether lack
adaisical and undeserving. By noon my
feet were so swollen that I could have
screamed, and yet not a moment had
come for rest. To and fro incessantly,
hurry and worry, more mistakes, more
good-natured advice from the Kitchen and
civil rebukes from the proprietor. The
stupid frau I now thoroughly detested, for
she not only had let hotcakes burn and
orders wait while she gossiped with
friends, but had waddled out into the
ante-room and told the gallant cooks
not to give us girls "any of that chicken" â
it was "too expensive."
As I came into the room I heard Henry,
the "histrionic" pantry-boy, descanting
as usual upon his unhappy lot and our
lack of consideration for ais aristocratic
lineage.
"I did have some hopes, but now that the
poor little blue-eyed girlee is gone there
ain't any manners among yon." And
rising from the damp and darksome cor
ner where he had been slicing Saratoga
chips he cast his empty pan ruefully upon
the sink-table, and striking a heroic atti
tnde nerved himself for the grand bread
and-butter act.
"Aw, come off! You're gettin' spoony!"
growled the red-headed dishwasher, who
was married.
'â¢Take that!" cried Tina, throwing a
bunch of radishes at the boy's Paderewski
hair and upsetting one of his skillfully
erected towers of bread on a row ol
dainty butter-pats.
"It's no disgrace ter be poor, but it's aw
ful unhandy," observed George, as he
stooped down to rake out some ashes from
the range.
"That's what!" echoed everybody, and
the head cook, a dashing young i'ellow at
tired like a Parisian chef, emphasized his
auproval by jerking open tbe oven door to
take out the smoking meats. His hilarity
over Henry's tragic predicament proved
too much, however, and the huge roasting
van suddenly landed upon the floor, send
ing beef, pork, veal and mutton broadcast
around us. He quickly and gracefully
impaled each succulent mass upon his
long fork and tossed it back. House
wifely scruples had no place in the curly
head beneath that snowy cap.

fewer pleasures than the farmhand, and
receives less for his work. His chances
for advancement are few, and year by year
they are decreasing.
Jack^Tar leaves the sea sometimes and
becomes a toiler on the land. He tills the
soil, buys and sells, and sometimes he sits
in a dingy or a handsome office.
Tbe song of the sea is yet in his soul.
The pictures he loves best are of wastes of
foam or stately craft. He reads the poe
try of the deep and smells the brine.
He likes to watch the ships go out from
the haven under the bill, and with each
there goes an unexpressed longing, a vision
of new lands, and of a creature living and
pulsing, who carries her human freight so
nobly. The sight of a wreck beating on
the rocks brings a pang as from watching
the agony of some great soul. We all feel
some of tbis sadness at the sight of a dead
or dying ship, even though we know not
why.
The sailors who enter the port of San
Francisco are of all nations. There are
many of tbe broad and ruddy sons of
Johnny Bull, for whose benefit the saloons
hang out their notice, "English Ale and
Dublin Porter." The fair-haired Swede
comes in numbers, and the dark Italian
feels at home. In the Sailors' Home
which is not a charity, but a temperance
boarding-house, may be seen almost every
type of face and figure, and more intelli
gent faces than stupid ones.
The American Jack Tar is worthy of a
higher social status than is now granted
him. He is worthy of more moral help,
more brotherly treatment.
To make a sailor there must be used
material that would mate a good man for
any work. He must be brave, for
his fighting is done without hope
of escape, and on our modern
warships he must endure the tortures of a
lost soul in the heat of battle. He carries
his life in his hand ever, and must ever be
ready to yield it up to the voice of the
storm. He must have the trained muscles
and the quick eye of an athlete and the
stoicism of a philosopher.

CALIFORNIANS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 2.-Most
everybody who ever lived in San Fran
cisco will remember John Washington,
the newspaper man. He is not the original
person who objected to the lie as a means
of self-preservation, but there is neverthe
less a trace of the old Georee stock in him.
He is here in New York now arid watches
one of the most valuable industries under
the eye of the city. His stand is at the Bat
tery and every pound of debris that leaves
the dock and is carried away to be care
fully searched is subject to his orders. In
other words he is the chief inspector of the
debris wharves. The privilege of having
the exclusive right to reap the valuable
materials that are found in the debris and
igarbage of this city is purchased at the
magnificent sum of over $100,000 annually.
All sorts of things are found in the loads
of stuff that are carted away, and up to the
time it is taken charge of by the contrac
tor who puts in the highest bid it is under
the care of the city and Mr. Washington.
He has not forgotten that the giad hand
is a popular thing out West and he ex
tends it to anybody who ever saw San
Francisco Bay or the Rocky Mountains.
One of the best compliments I ever

Ohio, where one William McKinley hails
from. Mr. Laugblin's son Homer has
just returned from the Stanford Uni
versity, where he graduated as a chemist
and engineer.
"My son has finished his schooling,"
said Mr. Laughlin, "and comes back with
nothing- but praise for California and the
university. I was glad to hear him speak
so highly of that institution and the Slate
generally, as I told him when he went
there I was giving him the best I knew of
in America. I have lived then l& great
deal off and on and own considerable
property in different parts of the
State. I made a' careful investigation
of the educational facilities of Stanford
University and found the faculty to
be equal to that of any other
academy of learning in America. The
climate all the year around was of the
best, and I felt that my son would ap
preciate my selection by the time he fin
after which music and dancing were resumed
and continued until the wee small hours of
the morning. Among those present were : Mr.
and Mrs. B. Bonnet. Professor and Mrs. H.
Schuette, Mrs. Alice Armstrong, Mr. ana Mrs

ished. From nil accounts he does. I hear
nothing but California from him now.
He wants to return and grow up with
the country, believing that in time it
is destined to overpower the East
from a standpoint of advanced civiliza
tion and 'opportunities for progression. If
everybody who visits and lives in Califor
nia feels as warm toward it as both myself
and son it will be the best advertised State
in the Union before lone, aDd I hope it is."
Mr. Laughlin is a widely traveled Ameri
can, and when he sends his son to the
western edge of the United States to be
educated it indicates that he has reasons
that are founded on something with a
strong conviction behind it.
Eduardo Cucuel, the young Californian
who has just returned from Paris and the
art schools, has accepted an offer from the
Herald to join its staff of illustrators. He
is also drawing some pictures for Scrib
ner's, and in time hopes to add to the
already long list of Pacific Coasters who
have distinguished themselves in New
fork.
Harry Day, son of ex-Supervisar Day of
San Francisco, is expected to arrive here
from France on the next steamer. He will
spend a little while taking in the sights
and the "out-of-sights" before getting back
to the Bay.
Old-timers will doubtless remember T.
F. Robertson of San Francisco. He be
longed to the early-day school of good fel-
Iqws, and was ci ief clerk of the Mint
in 1878. We ran across each other not
lbng ago, and he rushed me to a seat in
the St. Cloud Hotel, and nearly talked an
arm off me. I had to recall the history of
San Francisco for many years back and
tell it to him over and over again. He
seemed unable to fill up on news and im
pressed me several times with the fact that
there was no place lite the Pacific Coast.
You find this so often in residents of that
part of the country that it finally becomes
a novelty to see a man who does not want
to get back on the first train.
Mr. Robertson thinks he has lived the
best part of his life among the newspaper
crowd who used to cluster around the old
Press Club and down at the end of Mont
gomery street. When he reverts to those
days the tears almost well up in his eyes.

The officers of the Woman's Educational and

last Tuesday evening at their large parlors on
Van Ness avenue. The reports showed the
good work that had been carried on by the
ladles and their president. Mme. Louise Sor
bier. The second part of the evening was de
voted to vocal music, when the following pro
gramme was creditably rendered under the
direction of Mme. Ellen Coursen-Roeckel:

He hopes eventually to get back there and
live it over again. When one considers
what changes can take place, it is not sur
prising that Irwin Stump, now a million
aire, should atone time have been a clerK
under Mr. Robertson in the United States
Mint at something like $200 a month.
Frank McGuire, the newspaper man
who made such an excellent showing at
the Chicago and St. Louis conventions,
where he represented Thb Call, arrived
in New York the beginning of the present
week. He had the odor 01 Democracy all
over him, having passed through Wash
ington and shaken the hand of Mr.
Cleveland, from which he " accumu
lated the odor of angle worms and
Buzzards Bay sturgeon. Mack acts just
as though he had kissed Grover's kids
and walked on the grass like Carl Brown
and General Coxev. He has lost none of
that California freshness and vivacity that
has made him the energetic newspaper
man that he is to-day. After taking a trip
into Canada to visit his father, who is the
Collector of Customs at Ontario, he will
return to New York and use his talents to
distinguish himself here.
What appeals to be ihe matter with the
California cherry-growers? There is a
wild yeil here for white cherries and mar
ketmen cannot get enough of them.
Every fruit-supply house in this city is in
constant receipt of orders for California
cherries and there does not seem to be
half sufficient to supply the rapidly grow
ing demand.
From one point in the harbor recently I
counted the word California twelve times.
In every instance it was on some ware
house or manufactory. There is not an
other State in the Union so well repre
sented. The word California greets the
visitor's eyes immediately upon entering
the harbor and is almost as prominent as
Bartholdi's statue. At any rate it covers
a wider range of territory.
Miss Virginia Jackson, a niece of Col
onel Jackson of the sub-treasury of San

OUTING PARTIES
STILL POPULAR,
Mint Employes Enjoy a
Jolly Clambake at
San Bruno.
The Hosts of the "He" Camp
Entertain Parting Guests
at Glenwood.
White Wings That Never Grow
Weary and the Joys of the
Picnic Groves.
A jolly party of Mint employes enjoyed an
outing and clambake last Sunday. Camp wai
pitched in a pretty grove near San Bruno early
in the morning, and shortly afterward juicy
steaks and other viands were broiling merrily
on several fires. Liquid refreshments had not
been forgotten, and the day's festivities were
inaugurated with the burial of "dull care,"
genial Joe McAraie officiating in the capacity
of high priest during that impressive cere
mony.
Care being disposed of, the fun commenced.
Tom Sweeney gave a humorous exposition of
his views on the all-absorbing question ot 16
to 1 ; J. J. Terry sang, Morris and Pless played
the banjo and guitar, while Jim McClure, with
his inimitable impersonations, kept the boys
convulsed with laughter.
During the day one of the members of the
party produced a football, but as footballs and
Clam chowder are not intimately associated
the ball was soon relegated to an adjacent
wagon.
Late in the afternoon the piece de resist
ance, Fisher'a chowder, made its appearance,
and it was^chowder that only "Gene" knows
how to make. To show their appreciation
bottles were quickly brought into requisition
by the boys, to oe filled with the succulent
creation as future souvenirs for their friends.
Those present were: Eugene Fisher, Frank
Luttrelle, James McClure, Neil Beggs, Joe
Riordan, George Beatty, J. J. Terry, Tom
Sweeney, Bud Estes, Tom Kelly, J. D. Berry,
John Degan, Tony Marisch, John McArdle,
Harry Pless and Grant Morris.
The closing days of the campers who have
been sojourning for several weeks past at
Glenwood, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, were
marked by an incident which proved one of
the moit pleasant among tne many agreeable
features of their stay. This was a most delect
able luncheon tendered by Messrs. Hugh
Evans and Will McLsughlin of San Francisco
inmates of the "He" camp, to Mr. and Mrs. D.
J. Walker of Madrone camp on the day prior
to the breaking up and departure for the City
of their guests of honor.
The table was spread in the open air under
the umbrageous branches of nature's kings of
the forest, the giant redwoods and oaks. Ihe
menu comprised every delicacy of the season,
and what added zest to the repast was the fact
that all the toothsome viands were cooked and
served by the two genial hosts, who had deco
rated the table most exquisitely with ferns,
greens, etc. Covers were laid for twelve, and
a bark souvenir, whereon each guest's name
was written, was laid on their plates.
The guests unanimonsly voted the repast
fully equal to that prepared by a professional
chef, and when all the wants of the inner man
had been satisfied a vote of thanks and three
rousing cheers were given Messrs. Evans and
McLaughlin for their hospitality. After wish
ing "Great Evans" and his chum "long life and
prosperity" the party separated, after singing
r 'God Be With You Till We Meet Again."
Those participating in the luncheon were as
follows:
Mr. and Mrs. D. J. Walker. San Francisco;
Mr. and Mrs. George E. Oatman, San Francisco;
Mrs. M. J. Gladwin, San Francisco; Kate A.
Halsey. Oakland; Mrs. Frank Halsey. Oakland ;

A Calcutta correspondent sends the fol
lowing interesting narrative illustrating
the clairvoyance of South African "witch
doctors," the circumstances having oc
curred in the Transvaal:
Myself and friend were out on a hunt
ing and prospecting trip with a Boer, and
were traveling with a wagon and oxen,
with, of course, our saddle horses for long
distance work.
We had "padded the hoof" for along
distance this particular day, and about 2
o'clock we had outspanned some little
distance from a "sprint," or small stream.
The boys had gone to the water with the
oxen, the game stew was in the three
legered iron pot over the fire and we had
thrown ourselves down under the wagon
to get a smoke and rest in the shade.
Nearly on the point of oozing off to
sleep, I heard something moving in the
grass, and not knowing what it might be,
as we were far enough from civilization
for it to be almost anything, I quietly got
upon my knee to look over the grass, at
the same time grasping my rifle ready for
any emergency. But there was no neces
sity for that, as it was a Kaffir coming to
the wagon, and from his peculiar style of
dress I knew him to be a "witchdoctor."
i had often seen these fellows, and
had heard a great deal about what they
could do En the way of telling past, present
and future events, but, although the
Boers employ and believe in them, I must
say that up to this time I certainly had no
faith in their powers, but I was fated to
hear something this day which was more
than passing strange, and has made me
many times ask myself the question,
"What is it?"
The doctor had a belt of skins around
his loins, a skin cap upon his head, with
two or three long feathers stuck in it, and
attached to his loiobelt were two or three
small bags made from kid or lamb's skin.
Upon coming up to the wagon, he saluted
in Kaffir style and squatted upon his heels
without further addressing us. After a
while my friend asked: "Shall we get
him to throw his 'dol ossen?' " â meaning
for him to throw out of one of the bags the
different articles it contained on to the
ground, and according as they Jaid. to read
things from them. These articles con
sisted of pieces ol glass, crockery, bone,
iron, stone, etc ; in fact, an utterly worth
less medley, but from which they profess to
tell the past, present and future.
After asking him to throw them for us
he agreed to do so, but demanded thai we
each give him sixpence, and loosening his
oag he asked: "For which boss shall I
throw first?" My friend Bill was duly
elected premier. After throwing the"ossen"
out he immediately began by saying that
"two or three years ago the big boss went
across the big waters to white man's coun
try, and during the time he was there he
fell in love wiih a young lady. He was
going to be married to her, but she died.
Now he is engaged to another young lady
in Pretoria, but although they are very
iond of each other they will never marry,
as her father will break the engagement
because he has not money enough to please
him."
During the time the doctor was saying
this he did not raise his eyes from the
"ossen." It seemed as if he were really
reading something from them; and Bill
and I were looking at one another in as
tonishment, as it was perfectly true that
he was in Europe at the time mentioned,
and while touring on the Continent fell in
with a very nice, jolly German family
traveling in the same direction, got very
intimate with them, and eventually fell
in love with the daughter and was engaged
to be married to her in the following
September, when, to his great sorrow,
she fell ill and died. Thus the past event
told was correct.
It was also true that at the present time
he was engaged to a young lady in Pre
toria. I was a friend of both and am sat
isfied that they were very, very fond of
each other, and were looking forward to a
happy married existence, which they both
deserved. The present was true.
Now comes the most curious part of the
affair. About four months after thia, the
young lady's father really 'did break the
engagement, stating that he did not think
Bill was in a good enough position to keep
his daughter as she bad been in the habit
of living, and he would not sanction th*
match. The tuture came true.
After having finished with Bill the doc
tor threw the "ossen" for me. but imme
diately picked them up and replaced them
in the bag, saying "they were too tired,
they would not talk to him any more."
Of course we knew there was something
up, so I ordered him to throw them again,
which he did, but only to gather them up
as before. Upon using a great deal of
pressure he at last said he did not want
to hurt my feelings, as what they had to say
was not plea&ant news; but upon my
again commanding him to throw and read
them he did so, and you can easily im
agine that under the circumstances our
curiosity was raised to a great pressure to
know what was coming for me.
Upon looking at them for some minntes
he said: "The boss lives half an hour to
foot, the other side of Proot Dorp. He is
a married man and has two little daugh
ters, and the youngest of them, about 18
months old. is so very ill that the medi
cine doctors say she can't live, and her
mother is walking about with her in her
arms in a very excited state, and is say
ing, 'She will die, and her father will
notget home in time to see her again.' "
Well, you can imagine that after the
truths ha had told about Bill, and know
ing that what he was telling me about my
residence, wife and family was also per
fectly true, it gave us both a bit of a
hock, especially myself. I tried to look
(heerful and laugh it off, but could not, so
it last I took oat my pocketbook and
taade a note of the day, time and words
tsed by the doctor, and Bill initialed it

and our Boer friend said: "Karels, it zal
zeker de vaarhuit wes." (Men, it is cer
j tainly the truth.)
The matter was forgotten during the
next day or so, and it was about six
: weeks before we reached horne â as we
I were some 400 miles north of Pretoria at
: the lime â and just as I jumped off the
j wagon to embrace my wife and children,
j she said: "Oh! Tom, darling, I am
Iso glad you have come, for our
i little Violet has been so ill that
i the doctors gave her ud and said she
I would certainly die." I then thought
| about the witch doctor, and immediately
I hauled out my pocketbook, asking my
! wife what date the child was so ill. She
! immediately gave me the same date as
j that in my book and the time of day
exactly corresponding.
When I asked her if she could recollect
any particular thing she said in her ex
citement over the child's serious state, she
said: "Yes, dear; I could think or say
nothing else as I was carrying her about
the bedroom but, 'Oh, my little darling!
I am afraid your dada will never see you
again.' "
Here is the whole thing. "What is it?"
A Kaffir, you may say, almost a savage,
perfectly uneducated, did not understand
a single word of English, had never seen
us before â at least, not to our knowledge
comes out in the bush and for a shilling
tells you most thrilling truths, both past,
present and future; in fact, what I con
sider most wonderful was his telling me the
very words my darling wife was saying, in
her great agony of mind, at the very mo
ment he was telling me, 400 miles away.
The affair Has always been a great mys
tery to myself^nd friend. We have told
of it many times to friends, some believ
ing, others doubting it, and we still re
main in ignorance of what it could be;
therefore, I have at last come to the de
termination to ask some one to answer my
question, "What is it?"
Without attempting to enter into
details, our correspondent's question may
be answered in a few words. There are
various methods of natural divination,
divided into two broad classes.
Tne first of these is based on the fact
that the soul itself, from its own nature
and essence, has some foreknowledge of
future things, as well as a retrospective
view of the past By means of this soul
power, acting as clairvoyance and clair
audience, the Kaffir saw the sick child and
heard the spoken words. The second gen
eral class is based on the postulate that
the soul, after the manner of a
mirror, receives some secondary illumin
ation. This may be set up by
artificial divination (external signs, etc.).
The casting of the bits of stone by the Kaf
fir comes under the head of lithomancy.
By observing the relative position of the
various pieces, as regards size, color, etc.,
he formed a general idea or skeleton of the
facts to be known, and with this as a basis
he was able to become en rapport clairvoy
antly with the exact facts of the
past, and the probable facts of the
future, so far as they had been
mapped out by Karma. The whole oper
ation comes within the range of natural
Ibws, though they are little understood at
present. Ra M Singh.

Nuggets

JKe Wonderful GKvmU
Found by Oliver
Martin Worth
$20,000.
The history of the great California nug
gets is in many respectsinteresting and ro
mantic. The discovery of one of the great
est ever found was undermost singular cir
cumstances. It is known as the Oliver
Martin nugget and a gilded cast of it is
now an interesting object to all visitors of
the California Mining Bureau. This nug
get was found near Camp Corona in
Tuolumne County and weighed 151 pounds
and six ounces. Oliver Martin and a com
panion named Flower were camped in a
canyon when a terrible rainstorm came on
in the night and the water in the stream
suddenly rose to a great height. The
miners attempted to climb the hill, but
the flood overtook them and both were
carried down the stream. Flower was
drowned, but Martin, though severely in
jured, escaped. Afterward, while trying
to bury his companion's body in a grave
at the foot of a tree, Martin discovered the
nugget which bears his name. He was
too exhausted to remove it. He attempted
to reach some neighboring miners, but
fainted from overexertion and was found
on the trail by them in a state of com
plete collapse. It was weeks before he re
covered sufficiently to again visit the nug
get, which was found intact and removed
to camp with great rejoicing.
It was composed of gold and quartz,
but the lucky finder received $20,000 for it.
The Martin nugget was not the largest
ever discovered in California. One was
found in November, 1854, at Carson Hill,
Calaveras County, ' which weighed 180
pounds. Another nugget was suDsequently
found at the same place wnicb weighed
149 pounds. In August, 1869, W. A. Farish,
A. Wood, J. Winstead, F. C'evers and
Harry Warner were partners in the Mon
umental claim near the Sierra Buttes in
Sierra County. During the last week of
that month they discovered a huge nug
get which weighed 1493 ounces troy.
It was sold for exhibition purposes to R.
Woodward of San Francisco, who paid
$21,637 for it. It was afterward melted
and $17,655 realized from it. Sierra County
is famous for the number of nucgets found
within its limits. It was in this county
at a place called French Ravine that one
was found in 1850 worth $23,000. The
largest nugget ever found in Shasta
County was discovered in 1870. One day
three Frenchmen, Oliver Longcharap,
Fred Rochow and another, drove into the
old town of Shasta in search of a place to
mine. They happened to have some busi
ness with A. Coleman, a dealer in
merchandise, and inquired of him for a
lucky spot to mine. He carelessly
answered, "Go over to Spring Creek."
The Frenchmen followed his advice and

CAN WOMEN PLAY WHIST T
One of the features of the sixth congress of
the American Whist League was the large
1 number of ladies that were in attendance. It
pleases us to say they made a very excellent
showing. It is true they did not enter any of
the major contests, such as the Hamilton, the
A. W. L. or Minneapolis trophy, but the
matches they did enter showed by their whist
play that they were capable of holding their
own.
In all matches that we conducted where the
ladies played, they conformed to the law of
playing their cards on the table better than
the men. The law reads: "Each player, when
It is his turn to play, must place his card face
upward before him and toward the center ot
1 the table, and allow it to remain upon the
table in this position until all have played to
the trick, when he must turn it over and place
it face downward and nearer to himself, etc."
We could not help but notice this. Most of
the men dropped their card anywhere it was
convenient, on the edge of the table, on top of
their other cards, anywhere as long as they
dropped it. A "ball-bearing" jointed neck
ought to be applied to players who do this.
The first match that the ladies entered was
for progressive pairs and a remarkable feature
of this match was the distinguished achieve
ments of the ladies who took part in it. There
were six women teachers of the game who
played together and their scores were all
above the average. The six in question were
Mrs. T. H. Andrews (vice-president of the Trist
Club of Philadelphia), Miss Gertrude Clapp of
New York. Mrs. Rodman Wister of Philadel
phia, Mrs. W. S. Fenollosa of Salem, Mass.,
Mrs. W. H. Newbold of Philadelphia, and Mrs.
Rachael Frances Harrison of Columbus, Ohio.
The splendid showing of these ladies placed
them in the Tront rank in the wide world of
whist Sixty-one pairs entered in this match.
In the progressive match for Jours, twenty-five
clubs were represented, and twenty ladies
took part and they all made a remarkably
good showing. This was the match that was
won by Baltimore with 670 tricks. We an
nounced two weeks ago that the Trist Dupli
cate Club of this City came out second with
677 tricks; it should have been 667.
The match between the men and the women,
played on Thursday afternoon, was a sort
of a go-as-you-please conducted by Miss
Kate Wheelock. This match was won by the
men by a score of 20 tricks. Professor W. H.
Whltfeld and C. D. P. Hamilton made the
highest score for the menâ l 46 tricks. Mrs.
Fenollosa and Miss Harrison tied Mrs.T. H.
Andrews of Philadelphia and Miss Bessie Al
len of Milwaukee for second place with 142
located a claim on the creek, eight miles
north of -Redding, and in a few days dug
out the Shasta nugget, which they sold for
$16,000.
Plumas County, though it^has contrib
uted many millions of gold to the world's
supply, has furnished but feÂ«r nuggets.
The largest was found by a Chinaman in
1860, which was sold for $9600. Archie
Little, a miner, found one in the same dis
trict that sold for $4960. In Placer County,
in 1859, Edward Gilbert, in a drift mine
near Butcher Gulch, about a dozen miles
from Auburn, found a gold and quartz
nugget that he sold for $5000. The same
man later on discovered another one, less
valuable, however. Another miner, whose
name has not been rescued from oblivion,
found in Placer County the most beauti
ful nugget ever discovered in California.
The gold was imbedded in a mass of crys
tallized quartz. It sold for $6206.
In El Dorado County at Spanish Dry
Diggingb a nugget weighing 105 ounces
was found in 1853. It sold for $1800. An
other was found at Kelsey in tne same
county which sold for $4700. In 1863 a

tricks. The third best score was made by the
ladies with 137 tricks. The next match, "free
for all," for players not engaged in any of the
contests that the ladies entered, was the
straight whist. Saturday night this match
wound up the week's carnival. There were
sixteen tables and twenty deals were played.
The prizes, a rabbit's foot mounted in a silver
matchbox, were awarded to Mr. and Mrs. H.

AMERICA'S QUEEN HOLDS A LEVEE.
There were many other young ladies at the
Whist Congress, who played a very little. One
little woman, neatly dressed in dark blue,
with salmon lining to her jaunty jacket, -was
the center of attraction. From the crewn of
her well-poised head to the tips of her dainty
tun shoes she was every inch a "whist queen,"
full of dash and vigor. She held quite a levee
in the main corridor, for delegates from far
and near sought introductions to this famous
exponent of scientific whist. MissWheeiock
was one of the tournament committee, and
had very little time to play.
ECHOES OF THE CONGRESS.
The great whist department of England's
standard sportsmen's newspaper, the Field of
London, in its issue, of July 11 devotes the space
of thirty-two lines to its report of the pro
ceedings of the sixth congress of the American
Whist League, but there Is one item of infor
mation in It that our papers did not report.
It says: "The Minneapolis trophy was won by
the Baltimore Club of Baltimore, Indiana."
Our little scrapbook, "Echoes from the Con
gress," contains 380 columns of over 200 lines
to a column.
THE FATE OF SHORT-SUITERS.
The Globe of Boston says: "Judging by the
results of the Manhattan Beach whist tourna
ment, the Boston whist-players can't call the
Boston Baseball Club names."
ESTABLISHED TRUMP.
A communication was received by the re
cording secretary of the American Whist
League from the Superior Chess and Whist
Club stating that they wished to go on record
by their club passing the following resolu
tion: "Resolved, that it is the sense of this
club that an established trump should be
adopted for general use in the American Whist
League and that we recommend club as such
trump." The idea does not strike us with favor
at all, but we will be glad to get the views of
clubs on this coast
Milton C. Work, the whist editor of the
Evening Telegraph of Philadelphia, sailed for
Europe on Wednesday, July 29, therefore his
whist articles will be discontinued until his
return in the latter part of October. No one
mass of gold weighing 360 ounces was
found at Columbus, El Dorado County,
and was valued at $5236, and not far from
the same spot a poor Frenchman found a
nugget worth $5000. The finder was so
overjoyed at his rich find that he lost his
mind and bad to be taken to a lunatic asy
lum, where he subsequently died, and the
proceeds of his rich nugget were remitted
to his family in France. Near Knapp
ranch iv the same couniy John Strain dis
covered a nugget that weighed fifty
pounds, which was so nearly fine gold
that it brought when sold $9500.
Near Magalia in Butte County, on Aug
ust 14, 1859, Ira A. Willard found a nugget
that weighed 54 pounds. The celebration
which followed the discovery of this mass
of gold was participated in by every miner
for miles about, and is still regarded in the
annals of Butte as the greatest historical
event in the history of that prolific county.
The days of nugget-finding in California
seem to have passed away. Nowadays the
nugget has been supplanted by the pocket,
in which depositories rich finds of $100,000
at a time are not uncommon. It is not

HOWELL'S "WHIST OPENINGS."
In an issue of July 26 we asked Mrs. F. 11.
Atwater of Petaluraa to send us a criticism.
Mrs. Atwater says:
Mr. Howell's "Whist Openings" seems to me to
be a second edition of Foster, in which one finds
little to admire but his courage.
Ido not know what he means in his Introduc
tory remarks by "the fallacies of the long-suit
game."
Most of the leads and plays of the long-suit
game have been thoroughly tested by practical
players and only those rales and principles ac
cepted which have been proven to oe in the ma
jority of cases productive of the best results.
His attempt to ridicule those who do not agree
with him is not argument and "Cavendish and his
parasites" can never be convinced by such style of
reasoning, it might not be presumptuous to ask
Mr. Howell if he considers his opponents to be
novices at the game.
If so his "short-suit system" or any other system
might be equally effective; but with "long-suit in
valids" of ordinary whist intelligence his "system"
would at once be understood and he would flud his
game securely blocked.
His "short-suit system" seems to rest on the
false hypothesis that his Opponent cannot draw
correct references from the drop of the card.
While he is holding back his long suit "waiting
for something to turn up" his opponent will be
taking in the tricks and Mr. Howell will find him
self turned down.
In leading a supporting card that support has
two chances of assisting an adversary to one ot as
sisting a nartner, and if these adversaries be "up
to-date* players they should be able to place the
strong suits and defeat the short-suit tactics.
In his summary of secondary leads hesaya:
"Keep your nerve, and don't turn a hair even if
the development seems to run dead against you;
stick to your game, and, sooner or later, the ad
versary will abpndon bis, which shall be the short
suiter's victory and reward."
This is not whist, but rather a matter of physi
cal endurance.
The "top aownwara method" of playing short
suits Is a new idea in whist literature and well
worth the consideration of "Tristians." But, taken
as a whole, a match between teams of short-suit
players would seem to me to suggest the result of
the simultaneous explosion of an assortment of
skyrockets sending their fiery darts in all direc
tions without apparent aim or purpose.

A Jree
JKat Has Split
A BoWlder
JRemarUable Strength
of QroWth of a
Jflill Valley
Laurel
The wonderful force of the roots of grow*
ing trees is demonstrated on a hill in Mill
Valley, where a laurel has split a huge
bowlder into three pieces. The tree is of
the type common in many parts of Cali
fornia, but there are several queer things
about it and its surroundings. The place
where the tree grows is a most unusual
one for its species, which naturally re
quires considerable moisture. The tact of
the tree taking root in a barren rock 13
also unusual in California on account of
the long, dry summers, during which,
young sprouts usually perish unless there
is considerable moisture in the soil.
The exact location of this botanical curi
osity is a few hundred feet east of the trail
to the top of Tamalpais. Tne general ap
pearance of the tree is most unusual and
undoubtedly it is very old. At first glance
tlo oks like an oak, but a moat unusual
one. The upper branches are'<wi3ted and
turned iv all directions and a large portion
of them are dead. In reality the tree looks
like those iv the Dore illustrations of
Dante's Inferno.
An examination of the tree and its sur
roundings shows that the bowlder is one
of the largest stones in the vicinity and
cannot weigh less than 500 tons. The loca
tion of the tree is almost exactly in the
middle of the stone and about five feet
from the end of the split. This rift in the
rock is about fifteen feet long, and at one
end is only a few inches wide. At the end
where the tree is it is at least tnree feet To
prove that it was the tree that caused the
split them is a crack in one of the halves
of the bowlder showing that the force of
the growing roots was so much that it
cracked the rock where it could not
move it.
Miss Eastwood, a botanist of the Acad
emy of Sciences, gave as her opinion that
the strauge natural curiosity was the only
one of its kind in the State. She says that
in all her studies she Has never seen its
like here, although in localities where
there are summer rains the phenomenon
is not unusual. And yet even under those
conditions she never heard of a laurel
growing as the one in Mill Valley does.
In Miss Eastwood's opinion there must
have been a small rift in the bowlder to
begin with. Possibly ii was tight enough
to hold water. In the fall of the year the
seed of the laurel blew into it and in the
spring of the year came to life. The walls
of the rift then acted as sunshades and
also kept the water from being evaporated
too rapidly, so that the young shoot was
able to struggle through the long summer
until the winter rains came. Or it may be
that there was an unusually rainy summer
that gave the tree its start in life. After
the tree was a year old it was able to take
care of itself, and then showed its in
gratitude to the rock that had protected it.

Fusion and confusion are twins.
Where there is harmony of sentiment
union comes of itself.
Democracy and Populism don't even
pretend they will ever be wedded.
Read the Eastern weather reports and
rejoice that you live in California.
The people unite for properity while
politicians try to fuse for, the spoils.
The people may talk of this man or of
that, but their eyes are on McKinley.
There may be some uncertainty in trade
this year, but there is none iv politics.
We shall see in this canvass whether
rhetoric can talk business to a standstill.
The people would like fewer lessons in
money and more money to practice with.
While you rest, tbe campaign for pros
perity goes on and better times draw
nearer.
It is the evident intention of tbe boy
orator to make not only a circuit but a
circus in the East.
Life is short, but fortunately Presiden
tial campaigns are shorter, and we will all
survive this thing.
Even the caricaturists have had to drarv
the line at McKinley ; there is no way of
distorting his record.
Democrats and Populists may run a cam
paign together, but how could they run a
government together?
There is no occasion for a panicky feel
injilin business. Brvanism is only a wind
and will soon blow over.
Cleveland not only says nothing, but
send* teleerams to the press announcing
that he has said nothing.
Bryan goes to New York like a rocket
coruscating on the way, but we all know
what happens to rockets.
You can never cure the inveterate Demo
crat, and accordingly some of them are
still talking of reviving the income tax.
Democrats insist the tariff issue is not
loaded in this campaign, but whenever
they see it pointed at them they scatter.
The gold Democrats are in doubt what
to name their party, but the voice of the
people will not hesitate to call it Dennis.
It is well enough to sympathize with the
Eastern people over tbe excessive heat of
their weather, but we needn't sweat
about it.
To the heart of the patriotic and to the
mind of the intelligent the record of Mc-
Kinley is more eloquent than the tongue
of Bryan.
Woman^leuffraee would undoubtedly
strengthen tbe cause of home industry,
and all who favor the one shonld support
tbe other.
If Chairman Jones wobbles a little he is
not to be blamed, for it is very hard to
carry water on both shoulders while walk
ing a slack wire.
Every mask behind which the free-trader
has tried to conceal himself in this cam
paign is so thin that even dim-eyed people
can see through it.
There may be some who think a Demo
cratic gold ticket will fill a long- felt want,
but as a matter of fact it will be dropped
in a cavity and lost.
You will find it an invariable rule that
business men are hopeful of prosperity
exactly in proportion as they are sanguine
of Republican success.
Those who were clamoring for a home
market for home industries last year should
remember they have a cb&nce to work for
it and vote for it this year.
It is said that Sewall's stable is finer
than Watson's house, but what please.-
Democracy most is that Sewall's barrel is
bigger tban Watson's brain.
The only abiding sentiment in politics is
a patriotic desire for the National welfare,
and it is that sentiment which inspires the
people to support McKinley.
The Bryan notification meeting in New
York ought to be held in Tammany Hall,
as that is tbe only institution in the city
that is giving him any support.

THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE.
Aside from bis distinguished position as
bij party's candidate for President, Wil
liam McKinley is a conspicuous character
of the times. He is an ideal citizen of the
I'nited States by right of his lofty patriot
ism, true manhood and intellectual
strength. For more than thirty years he
has been promiitently identified with his
country's name as soldier or as statesman,
and every public trust that has been com
mitted-to bis keeping profited by his ad
ministration of it. }Ir. McKinJey is a
natural leader of men, and because his
own conduct of life is true and faultless,
bis influence is necessarily for good,
whether in social, political or commercial
life. Tuat .he is ambitious to be President
there is no doubt, bat who would turn
away from an honorable opportunity to be
the chief executive of the most powerful
of the nations of the earth?
Certainly Major McKinley would like to
lie chosen President of the United States,
but his ambition is born of a desire to be
in a positiou where he can put in operation
such economic policies as are Sure to ma
terially aid all the people in their strife
for higher and better conditions of exist
ence. It is ambition to help his fellows
rather than ambition to be conspicuous in
the political and social world. Mr. McKin
ley is not a politician in the common ac
ceptation of the word, but be is a political
economist of broad and comprehensive
views, and, moreover, bis theories of gov
ernment include the betterment of the con
dition of every person and every interest
in ail this broad land.
The evidence that Major McKinley
Mands close to the hearts and well in the
confidence, of the people 1 is that more than
two years before the St. Louis conventiou
the people themselves selected him for the
next President, and however much Demo
cratic newsnapers and orators may try to
make it appear that Mr. McKinley owes
bis nomination to Mark Hanna, the peo
ple know better. Had the party held no
convention at all, Mr. McKinley would
still betbe people's candidate. The man's
career for a third of a century was known
to the people, and the industrial situation
was such that the times demanded his
services. Mark Hanna did not "discover"
Major McKinley, and the St. Louis con
vention merely obeyed the voice of the
people when it officially commissioned
him to lead the country out of the sloughs
and marches of industrial and commercial
stagnation. â¢
That Mr. McKiuley will be the next
President no observer of the signs of the
tinie3 questions, but it is the strong per
sonality, the honesty of purpose and the
splendid record he has made in the ser
vice of the country that will elect him.
Mr. McKinley isnot greater than his party,
but his party selected him by command of
the people for its best man to administer
thr affairs of the whole country. Thete
never was a Presidential candidate who
more nearly represented the choice of the
rank and file. Mr. McKinley's nomina
tion came in answer to the call of the peo
ple, and the people demanded him because
his record in private and in public life sat
isfies them that he possessed the qualities
needed to restore, confidence in the busi
ness world, and remove the depressing in
fluences which Cleveland's administration
had caused to settle upon the channels
and highways of trade, industry and com
merce. ___________
A WORD TO FARMERS.
However important farmers may deem
the money question, it is very evident
that they should be more .deeply inter
ested in the question of good markets for
their produce. It ts no fault of the farm
ers of the United States that tbe bread
stuffs acreage of the other grain countries
has been multiplied in recent years. It is
not their fault that their competitors in
the grain-consumption markets of Europe
till their fields with labor that cost not
more than $3 a month for wages and
board. It is not their fault that such con
ditions have been forced upon them, but
the consequence of such competition need
not continue if they will assert their inde
pendence of the food-buyers of Europe.
The time was when the old country af
forded the American farmer a most profit
able market, but that was when this
country was Europe's chief source of food
supplies. No such necessity for the
product of our fields exists in Europe to
day. To-day the wheat-grower in Cali
fornia finds that prices for his grain in
Liverpool are fixed by the cheaper produc
tion of Argentina and Russia, and be must
sell at that price or not sell at all. Russia,
America and Australia can now be
relied upon by Europe for not less than
150,000,000 bushels oi wheat annually, and
very much more when the crop is larger.
All this wheat comes in direct compe
tition with the American farmer, and as
the cost of production under a pauper
labor system is so much less then under
the high-wage schedule of this country it
follows that our farmers are at a great dis
advantage.
But there is a remedy for these ills. We
must give capital the needed protection to
establish industrial plants all over this
country. When plants are established
there will come armies of skilled and un
skilled working people to operate them,
which will build up communities of con
sumers of farm products. That is ail that
is needed to eive our farmers a borne de
mand equal to their marketable surplus.
There is no reason why a single American
farmer should have to go to the expense of
shipping his grain and provisions to for
eign lands, but if tbe farmer would have a
market right at his door he must aid and
abet the proposition to protect labor and
capital that tbey may be able to establish
and maintain a market for him. There
must be reciprocal relations existing be
tween tbe larmer and those who would
provide home consumers of his produce.
So the whole matter resolves itself into
this: If farmers will help lo give labor
and capital protection against foreign in
dustrial plants and cheap labor American
labor and capital will make good markets
for American farmers at tbeir own home.
Tbe proposition is a simple one, and is
easily undertaken.
CALIFORNIA MUOH INTERESTED.
Over 18,000 men are now working nearly
2500 mines in 34 counties of California;
besides there is a small army of prospec
tors ransacking every nook and corner
that gives an indication of concealing
either one or both of the precious metals.
More than twice as many mines are in
operation than there were last year and
there are more than twice as many men
earning eood wages. All this is indicative
of something. Tbere is no more metal
in hiding than there was last year, nor
have prices in tbe metal markets under
gone a change that wculd warrant such
activity in the mining industry. There is,
however, a more confident feeling in all
lines of trade and business, and naturally
the mining interest of the Stete would re
spond to it.
The fact of tbe matter is, no intelligent
man who is not warped by party preju
dice believes otherwise than that Major
McKinley will be the next President, and
that with the incoming of bis administra
tion tbe wheels of commerce will begin to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
roll forward over highways of trade and
traffic that are free from obstruction. So
sure of it are the people generally that
hesitation is giving way to a desire to re
vive all lines of business. Capital is now
willing to eeek employment in developing
the resources of the State and to widen
and extend enterprises already estab
lished, which in turn would give labor all
needed opportunity for profitable and con
tinuous employment.
It i 3 believed that California will pro
duce $20,000,000 of gold the coming year,
and the same confidence in the future of
business conditions which is stimulating
the raining industry is bound to promote
all lines of legitimate trade operations
and give such a stimulus to business
enterprises and business operations ua the
coast country has not seen since Grover
Cleveland was inaugurated.
There is, nevertheless, such a thing as a
slip betwixt the cup and tbe lip. This re
vival in business activity which is work
ing its way through all the avenues of
industry Monies of a well-grounded belief
that the principles of the Republican
party, which are sound and altogether
trustworthy, will be put into operation in
the conduct of the affairs of the country
in the near future. But while all the in
dications certainly point to the election of
Major McKinley, he is not yet elected, nor
will he be unless every man who is inter
ested in having his business enterprise
placed upon a sure footing participates
earnestly in the work of the campaign.
November will surely come, but it will
give no promise of encouragement to
business enterprises unless business men
see to it that the party of repudiation and
sectionalism is routed, horse, foot and
dragoons.
TARIFF AND IRON.
A further study of the iron question
shows that free trade is ruinous to em
ployer and employe alike in the mining
industries of the United States.
It is shown by the testimony of experts,
published in to-day's Call, that without
a reasonable protective tariff American
wares are on a par with tliose of the cheap
labor regions of Europe, and this in
evitably results in a lowering of the wages
of American workmen.
For such reasons as these the thought
ful citizen will be slow to abandon the safe
ground of protection and prosperity for
the uncertaiu dreams of Bryanism. It
was Bryan, more ardently than any other
man, who argued for the Wilson bill as a
healthful measure for the country. In his
most celebrated Consresiionai effort Bryan
argued for free coal, free Iron, free wool
and free lumber. The Call has now
shown conclusively that business ruin and
industrial disaster have followed in the
wake of the Wilson bill in every one of
these great Industrie?.
TRUE CITIZENSHIP.
In his speech at Dcs Moines, lowa, last
Friday night, Mr. Bryan uttered a jrreat
truth when he said, "Grave are the re
sponsibilities of citizenship," but be failed
to say that it is not all of citizenship to
enjoy personal liberty and the protection
of property and reputation. True citizen
ship stands for a government that is an
extension of the conditions of an ideal
family life, with the right of every mem
ber thereof to participate in all accruing
good, and with each one feeling it to be
incumbent upon him to resist the ap
proach of whatever is calculated to give
one member advantages at the expense of
the community.
Citizenship in this county* means that
the citizen is the sovereign and not those
who are chosen from time to time to ad
minister the public affairs of the people as
a whole. Citizenship also imposes the duty
upon the citizen to join with the other
citizens and choose and commission cer
tain ones from among their number to
make laws and otherwise supervise and
direct the operation of a government
which stands for them collectively and
which protects them individually. Class
legislation deprives the citizen of his sov
ereignty and personal liberty m propor
tion as he is ruade to sustain a class with
out himself receiving benefit therefrom.
But Mr. Bryan has a very different
standard by which to fix the duty of citi
zenship. Assuming that he sincerely and
truly believes that bis economic theories
are based upon the highest and soundest
principles of government it does not neces
sarily follow that in practical application
they would benefit the people in any ave
nue of their social or business life. On
the contrary, it is a fact that is substan
tiated by the experience of civilization
that Mr. Bryan's theories of government
in application would encourage a spirit of
sectionalism which would culminate in
the establishment of favored and unfa
vored classes and the deprivation of the
unfavored of the strength of their own
citizenship.
Mr. Bryan's test of true citizenship
would be unhesitating willingness on the
part of the citizen, no matter in what part
of the country he might be, to exercise his
sovereignty in advancing the best inter
ests of the interior States by unlimited ex
penditure of the general public's money,
to the end that the States of the interior
might become the seat of tbe Nation's
wealth and political power. In that Mr.
Bryan does not differ materially from tbe
meaning of citizenship as taught by Cal
boun, Davis and Breckinridge, only that
he would locate bis empire in tbe valley
of the Mississippi River, which river be
would transform into a perfect water high
way at tbe expense of the whole country.
Next to building up tbe Mississippi Val
ley by taxing tbe whole country, to help
on in the work of confirming tbe doctrine
of sectionalism, Mr. Bryan believes tbe
test of true citizenship to be tbe entire
willingness of tbe sovereign to aid owners
of silver mines to oblige the Government
to double tbe price of their product by
making about 50 cents' worth of it tha
standard dollar of the country, without
guarding the interests of the people at
any point. Mr. Bryan believes acqui
escence in a scheme to make a few mine
owners rich at the expense of the 70,000,
--000 people in this country is evidence of
true citizenship. Silver monometallism
is what silver-mine owners want, and to
do as they want is good citizenship, ac
cording to Mr. Bryan. The responsibili
ties of citizenship are very great, as Mr.
Bryan says, and because citizens know
their responsibilities to be great they will
not lend tbe rights and power of their
sovereignty to Mr. Bryan to establish an
oligarchy in tbe interior or in any other
sections, or to build up a plutocracy of
mine-owners.
WEYLEE WANTS PEACE.
The news comes from Cuba that Weyler
and tbe insurgent leaders are negotiating
terms of peace, but most likely it is a
rumor of Spanish manufacture. If the
friends of Cuba in this country could be
made to believe that such negotiations
were pending tbey very naturally would
cease gathering up munitions of war and
providing ways and means to get them on
Cuban soil, and no doubt that is exactly
the foundation of the story. The Cubans
have had tbe best of it so far, and there is
no reason to believe that they will apt ul
timately win, while on the other hand
Spain woula not agree to terminate the
war without continuing her jurisdiction
over the island.
It is possible that the recent warning
proclamation of President Cleveland may
have discouraged the Cubans somewhat,
but it should not,, The proclamation was
a mere matter of form, and Cleveland
himself did not believe it would be re
ppected when he issued it. Moreover, the
agents of the Cubans in Spain are doing
good work for the cause in the direction
of creating the suspicion that Spain is in
great danger of a powerful demonstration
against the monarchy, which, together
with victories in Cuba, ought to inspire
the revolutionists with confidence in their
ability to ultimately establish a republic.

THE BEET-SUGAR INDUSTRY.
San Diego Union.
The beet-sugar industry, in which California
is bo specially interested, is one that might
uuder a protective policy afford almost bound
less possibilities. As matters are to-day a very
large proportion of the sugar consumed iv the
United States is imported. But with proper
encouragementâ such as European countries,
especially Germany and Austria, give to their
sugar-makersâ the United States should not
only *upply its home market, but should be a
large exporter of this commodity. Mexico,
for example, should be a good customer. Beet
sugar is now shipped from Franc* and Ger
many to New Orleans and sold on board the
steamers to merchants in Matamoras, Mexico,
at 3% cents per pound, the freight from New
Orleans together with all duties bringing the
price up to 4Ji cents per pound.
Of course the fact that the sugar can pay
for so long a haul and can undersell the prod
uct of American refineries, is due to the
direct aid given to the sugar-makers in the
country where it is produced. Under these
circumstances the enormous disadvantage at
which this country is placed it apparent. The
United States is excluded from trale with iv
next-door neighbor, and, what is worse, is
made dependent upon Europe for a commodity
that cau be produced here in practically un
limited quantities. To California this subject
is of peculiar interest. The beet-sugar indus
try has already made a very substantial be
ginning in this State. The next year or two
will unquestionably see the erection of several
new factories and an increase of many thous
ands of acres of sugar-beets. Under a wise
protective policy the field ior the, industry
would be almost boundless

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
MUSTERING THE FORCES.
Beyax Democrats and Populists Abe Tbying
to Get Together.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
The true character and entire reach of the con
spiracy entered into at the Chicago conven
tion by General Weaver and his kind of Popu
lists there in attendance and the silver Demo
crats in control of the convention to demoral
ize and finally absorb the People's party by
bololy adorning a sort of Populist platform
and nominating Bryan as a sort of Populist to
fit that platform, may now be said to be pretty
well understood by the public. It was a wise
and deep-laid scheme, as results abundantly
prove. By a sly intimation that Bryan was a
Populist at heart they gave the gold Demo
crats a cbance to fall into their trap and begin
to shout that the Populists had got control
of the convention, and they did take up the
cry which was immediately proclaimed iv
great sensational headlines by all thÂ« gold
Democratic newspapers and was repeated and
re-echoed by all the Republican journals
throughout the country.
It was a great scheme and it worked well.
Indeed, it swept the country as a kind of men
tal epidemic, and by the time the Populists
met in St. Louis in National Convention so
great was the furor over .Bryan and silver that
straight Populists were openly and wantonly
denounced in speech and priut as traitors to
the people aud in the pay of Hanna if they
even ventured to protest against being rushed
and stampeded at once aud unconditionally
into the Bryan camp and submissively taking
orders from General Weaver, Senator Allen and
Tom Patterson. But I do not propose to re
hearse the painful scenes of the Populist Na-.
tional Convention, the most trying of all being
the surrender of Populist "leaders" to the con
spirators and their active zeal in behalf of the
conspiracy to turn the Populist National Con
vention iuto a Populist National ratification
of Bryan Democracy. It failed, because more
than two-th.rds of that convention were
straight Populists who refused to bow the knee
to the new Democratic silver Baal.
In the hour of apparent triumph of the Bry
anized Populists, with Allen chairman of the
convention and Weaver chairman of the plat
torm committee, though Weaver had won his
place by one vote and Allen, the former idol
of the party, had only won his place by a
small majority over Campion of Maine,
a man in utter obscurity and unknown
to a dozen of the 1350 delegates, the
great mass of the convention rose as by a com
mon impulse and overturned the whole
scheme of the conspirators by nominating a
true and genuine Populist for the Vice-Presi
dency, and thereby gave the conspirators no
tice of what would follow any further attempts
to destroy the People's party. But the infatu
ation which then possessed Weaver and his co
conspirators Mtill seems to urge them on in a
mad effort even yet to make their conspiracy
succeed.
The Alabama frauds by which it would be
made to appear that Populists are losing large
numbers of voters, the refusal of the Missouri
Democracy to treat with or even consider the
Populists of that State, the foolhardy and un
provoked sneers of Chairman Jone? against
the Populists of the South, the contempt ex
pressed for Populists by the great Democratic
newspapers and the persistent refusal to con
sider the claim of Watson as the candidate of
the Populist convention, backed by an offen
sive partisan zeal on behalf of Sewali, all go to
show the determination of Democracy to over
ride and crush down the Populists as a party.
But as the conspiracy to forma silver De
mocracy and ride into power on the wave of
popular discontent with present oppressive
conditions and at the same time get rid of the
formidable People's party by betrayal through
its trusted and honored leaders at the St.
Louis convention came to naught and failed
utterly by the uprising of the mass of dele
gates, so the second attempt to destroy
the party and consummate the conspiracy by j
Alabama frauds, by ignoring the party's exis
tence as in Missouri, by sneering it down as
attempted by Chairman Jones and by treating j
It with contempt as practiced by Democratic
newspapers, will certainly come to naughtand
fail utterly, for I perceive that eveu in Ne
braska, the home of Bryan and Allen and
Holcomb, the straight Populists in State con
vention yesterday "very nearly overturned ail
the carefully laid plans for fusion with De
mocracy"; that in Kansas there was a two
days' struggle in the State Convention over
fusion in which the straight Populists won
about all they claimed; that in lowa the
Weaver fusionists came very near being
routed, and that in Indiana the Populist Â» re
fused to come to any terms of union with the
Democrats.
In the South the situation of the infatuated
Weaver fumionists is even more unsatisfactory.
Under the astute leadership of Tom Watson j
the Georgia State Convention has adopted a
plan to checkmate the Democratic determina- I
tion to have Sewali at any cost or loss to Popu- |
lists, which will doubtlees be adopted by the
whole South, namely, to put up only Bryan !
and Watson electors until Sewali is withdrawn,
and if he is withdrawn they will then give
part of their electors for a partof the old Dem
ocratic electors. "We can't vote for Sewali,"
is the cry.
There is still anoiher check on the scheme of
the conspirators. It comes from a new quar
ter. Notwithstanding the fact that such
"leaders" of the silver Republicans as met in
the little silver convention in St. Louis did all
they could to help stampede the Populist Con
vention into the Bryan corral by nominating
Sewali as well as Bryan, the rank and
file of the silver Republican voters are not in
favor of returning the Democracy to power
even under the leadership of Bryan, but will
vote for an honest and honorable session of j
Populists and silver Democrats.
Like all Populists who are not aspirants for j
high office these honest silver Republicans
find little comfort or satisfaction in working
with Tammany and Senator Hill for the suc
cess of Democracy ; they, in common with all
straight Populists, would rather see McKiuley
elected, with the certain object lessons which
would follow, than help to restore a half-con
verted Democracy in alliance witu Hill and
Tammany in charge of the Government. These
silver Republicans, as a rule, are genuine anti
monopolists and hence they are in accord with
Populists, agreeing with tiiem that the rail
roads and the banks should not own and oper
ate the Government, as at present under
Cleveland and as proposed by Hanna.
I conclude with a word of warning to arro
gant Democrats and the no less arrogant silver
Republicans who shout for Sewali and deride
Watson. There is a limit to the patience and
endurance of self-respecting Populists. Much
more than half of the true Populists feel but
little satisfaction in the present alliance with
men who regard their cherished principles as
impractical "isms," and are a trifle too blatant
in expressing their contempt for these "isms."
They gravely question the wisdom of going
into partnership in the hazardous business of
conducting the Government on such lines as
may be found in common between such In
congruous partners. They look forward to the
end * such an administration as would fol
low such an unassimilated combination of
discordant elements and they have their
doubts. Will the end justify the means?
Will not such an administration be followed
by a reaction which will place the cause for
which the People's party stands ten or twenty
years back of where it stands to-day?
I am sure all thoughtful Populists are far
less enthusiastic over the present situation
than the somewhat over-confident and alto
gether too arrogant silver Republican, and
Democratic "leaders" would be wise in desir
ing these Populists should be. Tnese over
zealous sticklers for Sewali and the original
conspiracy to get rid of the Populists as a
party have shown but little political or even
common sense in their attitude and utter
ances. They will do well to pause and reflect.
I. f they should discourage or disgust too many
straight Populists, their vaulting ambition
will o'erieap itself and fall on 'tother side.
They will not get these straight Populist votes.
That means rout and defeat. If they simply
stay at home Mr. Bryan will stay at home, too.
While I earnestly desire an honorable union
with men opposed to the rule of gold and
monopoly, I have little faith in a union on
silver alone, for the moment that issue Is en
acted into law the party will go to pieces ior
want of an issue to which ail are committed,
and for which they will stand together. A
failure to secure a broad and honorable union
on permanent issues will rest upon the De
mocracy with all its consequences, if those be a
failure. Joseph asbuby Johnson.

WORTHY OF CELEBRATION.
Fresno Republican,
â¢~ If Fresno had no other important achievement
to celebrate the coming of the Valley road
would in itself constitute a sufficient cause for
a public demonstration which would fitly ex
press the buoyancy and hopefulness of public
sentiment m d give notice to the outside world
that a great step in the industrial history of
the community had been taken. Making due
allowance: for over-estimate of benefits the
saving which will be realized by the producers
and consumers of Fresno County through com
petition in transportation will make itself felt
directly or indirectly \in every branch of ;in
dustry. i f :":.>'- T â¢ ''::\'- :â  â â ;â - ',â â¢': â 'â  ",-^'C *. : :â '':â ?
Various interesting -"estimates have been
made of the difference in the amount of the
old freight rates and the new by reason of i the
building of the ,' competing road. The San
Francisco Examiner estimates . the ; difference
to ) be $1,000,000 annually. l P. A. Buell, presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce at Stockton,
says that I the difference j in cost of < freight Iby
reason of the operation of the tariff rates of
the : new railroad will â  amount :to $4,000,000
annually. The $1,000,000 estimate ', is ,* an
amount equal to 5 per cent per annum on
$20,000,000 of ! added wealth to â  this valley;
the $4,000,000 an amount equal to 5 per cent
on $80,000,000. - - ; r r - -v - -
I v John F. â â  McMuliin. president of the Fresno
National Bank, cays ; that there will be left in
[ fiesao : Couoty by rensoaot â  ttia building of
the road up to this point $250,000 annually
that would have been paid out in freight: this
at 5 per cent is interest on $5,000,000. If the
extension be made, for instance, to Reealy,
twenty-five miles, or one-fifth of 125 miies,
the distance from here to Stockton, on the
basis made by the Examiner, there would be a
saving of 5 per cent on $4,000,000. or $200,t
000; if Mr. Buell's estimate be correct then
there would be left as the difference annually
among the ranchers between here and Reedley
by reason of the extension of the road $800,
--000, or 5 per cent on $16,000,000, which must
be considered as so much added wealth to
Fresno County.
Why not celebrate, indeed?
ALLISON AND BIMETALLISM.
Chicago Inter Ocean.
There is no public man in this country who
stands more squarely for the genuine Dimetal
liÃm of the Republican party than Senator
William B. Allison, or who has had more to do
with monetary legislation in this country for
the last twenty years. He helped pass the
legal-tender act which gave us our greenbacks,
and the resumption act under which they were
made and are now as good as gold, but nis
prominence in finance began with the remone
tization of silver, the act as it finally passed
bearing the hyphenated name, Bland-Allison
bill, aud that with entire propriety.
It was Senator Sherman's ill fortune in 1890
to have his name linked with a mon^y bill that
he did not personally approve, but Mr. Allison
was thoroughly satisfied with the bill which
bears in part his name. Mr. Bland never
was, any more than he is now. He was then
and is now a free or single silver man, but Mr.
Allison was opposed to either single standard.
He was always an earnest supporter of the
policy adopted by the United States at the
firsi, and never abandoned, namely, keeping
both metals on substantially the same mone
tary basis. 'â  .
And now Mr. Allison has entered the arena
of current financial discussion tbrouÃh a letter
to a Republican editor in bis Stote, Harvey
Ingham of the Upper Dcs Moiflts. He con
cludes the letter with the observation that the
silver question is a vital oue in a world-wide
sense, and that international bimetallism is
making progress in Europe. The greatest ob
staoie in the way of apparent progress has for
the last three years been Grover Cleveland.
The international conference simply took a
recess, expecting to convene again in 1893.
or at the farthest 1894, but Mr. Cleveland
put the whole matter in the vault, shut the
door, turned the knob, and let no one else
have the combination. It is true, however, as
Senator Allison claims, that bimetallism is
making rapid progress in Europe. It is rea
sonable also to conclude, as the lowa Senator
does, that "if we make no mistake now it is
likely to produce a practical solution whereby
silver and gold will again circulate at a prac
tical parity in value at an agreed ratio."
This is a timely message from a statesman of
Mr. Allison's prominence. It Is just the kind
of a message to head off the misrepresentation
of the Republican position by those, mostly
but not ail Democrats and Populists, who as
sume, if they do not insist, that the Republi
can party is now pledged to the single gold
standard. On the contrary, its triumph at^the
polls is necessary to prevent practical mono
metallism.
THE BEET-SUGAR INDUSTRY.
Los Angeles Times.
In 1890, the year before the McKinley
bounty law took effect, about 8,000,000 pounds
of beet-sugar were produced in this conntry.
Of this all but 850,000 pounds were produced
in California. Under the stimulus of the
bounty the production of beet-sugar rapidly
increased, until in 1894 (in which year the
bounty was repealed by the Wilson bill) the
production amounted to over 52,000,000
pounds. About four-fifths of this quantity was
produced in California, and the remainder in
Nebraska, Utah and Virginia. Nearly one
half of the product of this State came from
Cbino.
The advantages of this State as compared
with other States for the production of beet
sugar as shown by official reports are very
great. The average yield of sugar per acre of
beets in California was 2838 pounds. In Utah
it was but 1491 pounds per acre, in Nebraska
1327 pounds, while in Virginia it was only
1012 pounds per acre.
The beet-susrar factories in California are
three in number, one located at Watson villr.
near Monterey (the Spreckels factory), one at
Alvarado, near San Francisco, and the other
at Chlno. The superiority of Southern Califor
nia as the home oi the sugar-beet is manifested
by the fact that the average yield of sugar to
the acre of beets at Chino was 3611 pounds, as
against 2488 pounds at Alvarado and 2432
pounds at Watsonville. The average propor
tion of sugar in the beets grown at Chino was
over 13 percent, lar exceeding any oAer per
centage shown in this country, and, probably,
unequaled in the world.
We import annually about 3,500,000,000
pouuas of sugar, in payment for which we
send gold out of the country to the amount of
$106,000,000. Would it not be better to pro
duce the sugar here and keep this money at
home to be paid to our farmers and laborers '.'
Would it not be desirable to cover Southern
California with prosperous villages, depending
on a crop which has an unlimited home
market ? The provisions of the McKinley bill
which aimed to do this were ruthlessly re
pealed by the Democrats iv the Wilson bill,
and now the same party has presented for
the suffrages of the people of California a
fanatical free-trader and a deadly opponent oi
all bounties and all protection to home in
dustries â which his name is Bryan. Can there
be any doubt that the material interests of
our people demand the election of McKinley ?

A HISTORY OF BANKING IN ALL OF THE
LEADING NATIONS. Compiled Dy thirteen
authors; edited by the editor tof the New York
Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin.
Four volumes. New York : Journal of com
merce and Commercial Bulletin, publishers;
price, complete, $24.
As a contribution toward the elucidation of
the currency and banking questions, now oc
cupying the earnest attention of the American
Nation in particular, the work before us se;ms
to be of inestimable value. It includes twenty
separate histories, written by thirteen authors
eminent as economists, literati or practical
bankers, and the idea has been to treat the
history of banking in each country from the
earliest periods up to the most recent dates.
The work has involved an enormous amount j
of labor and large pecuniary expense, and it
stands out admittedly as the most complete
and comprehensive history of banking that
has ever appeared. It presents the banking
experience and the banking lessons of the
United States, Great Britain, Russia, France,
Italy,^Belgium and the other L.atin nations;
the Scandinavian nations, Germany and Aus
tria-Hungary, Holland, Canada, Alsace-Lor
raine, China and Japan, in a connected series,
and all treated by the highest authorities and
most careful students of the subject in their
respective countries. In a prefatory note
the editor, William Dodsworth, says:
The aspects of our times seem to appeal to our
statesmen, our economists, our bankers and our
intelligent citizens at large for a candid and thor
ough examination into the instrumentalities
through which the exchanges of our seventy mil
lions of active population are transacted. The
publishers of this work conceive that ope of the
best ulds to such an investigation must lie in an
unbiased study of the banking and monetary sys
tems of all nations as developed by a continually
progressive experience. These volumes are de
â igned to encourage ana assist such education.
William Graham Sumner, professor of po
litical economy at Yale College, is the author
of the "History of Banking In the United
States," which takes up the first volume. It is
interesting to learn that the money question
In this country has been struggled with con
tinuously for nearly three centuries, begin
ning with the first settlement at Jamestown,
Va., and going on with variations ever since.
"All the doctrines of currency," sayÃ Pro
fessor Sumner, "have to be learned over again j
apparently every ten or fifteen years, if, in
deed, they are ever If arned at all. From the S
landing of the first settlers at Massachusetts i
Bay until to-day the country has never en- j
joyed ten years of peace, rest and security j
with an established and satisfactory system of j
currency."
In his history, Professor Sumner has adopted
trie composite method. Periods of about
twenty years have been taken in which the
facts have teen arranged under each State
separately â the two banks of the United States
falling within two of these periods and being
carried along simultaneously. Thus the I
reader after learning what was done in Massa- j
chusetts in a given period learns what was |
done in each of the other States in the same |
period. Then he comes back to Massachusetts i
for the next period, and then to each of the |
other States for the corresponding period, j
This arrangement has its advantages in that i
it give-! us a continuous social history of the
United States in so far as relates to the money
question, and the reader will be surprised to
find how large a part of our social history is j
' embraced in that question. Yet it has one |
marked disadvantage, that the reader's atten- I
tion is frequently interrupted, and he becomes i
overburdened with iacts which he cannot j
assimilate uniess he is an expert in monetary j
science.
An idea of the amount of labor embodied in
this book may be formed from the fact that
the session laws of all the State Legislatures
south and west of Maryland have been exam
ined, and not only the features of all the gen- I
eral banking laws in tne Union, but the dis
tinctive features of all separate bank charters,
noted. In addition to this compilation -all
court decisions of any importance touching
the banking laws are referred to and quoted
so far as neediul. All secondary authorities
of importance, such as State histories, diaries,
biographies, Niles' Register, the works of Gal
latin, Gouge, Raguet and Matthew Carey, de
bates in Congress, records of lawsuits, besides
many newspaper files, have been brought
under contribution.
The distinguished Yale economist is an ad
herent of the "currency principle" as distin
guished from the "banking principle," i.e.,
he believes that bank notes should be issued
against deposited securities, and that the
greater or less amount needed at particular
times and seasons should be supplied by gold.
This is the Bank of England system. It is also
the National banking system. He acknowl
edges that such a system can never be elastic,
but he does not consider that elasticity of a
bank note is desirable. The reason is that
bankers would inflate and contract at their
own pleasure. In tne second volume of the
present series by Henry Dunning MacLeod the
contrary view is maintained.
Professor Sumner's views of the present
financial situation, which appear in the clos
ing paragraph of the initial volume, are here
qu< ted in full:
a. the moment of this writing the turmoil and
contusion, the conflict of opinions and projects,
the clash of political schemes In and around the
Chimney, are us great and mischievous as they
ever .vere. The banks have but a very subordinate
share in it and are not to blame for any part of it.
Eight or nine hundred millions of paper rest on a
ppecit reserve which was originally planned lor
three hundred aud forty-six millions, and
that upon a fallacious plan. The stability
of thU currency has been maintained for
two ye*TÃ by arbitrary purchases of gold. Involv
ing a manipulation of (he foreign exchanges.
Bnch manipulation may be excusaDle under great
stresÃO" other dangers, but it is perilous to some i
of the greatest and most delicate interests of the ,
country Theoretical and practical financiers
rnudt ag-ee that this manipulation is a subject of
grave apprehension, all the more because it is be
yond tht power of any man to foresee or estimate
thÂ« consequences in their remoter reactions and
more extended complications. The operation only
wins time. It is no remedy. When the respite ex
pires, if no sound measures have been adopted,
the problem is still there, greater and more op
pressive than ever, and com plicated with the con
sequences of arbitrary interference with oie of
the most important and most delicate parts of the
financial system. In the meantime, the factions
produced by the various dogmas about the cur
rency, by interests engaged iv it, and by party in
trigues io profit by it, have grown fierce and stub
born. They exhaust their strength in making a
deadlock. We are in a financial crisis which is be
coming chronic, and whicn will be solved by a
great disaster unless we can rally knowledge and
statesmanship to deul with it.
j The second volume contains a history of
banking in Great Britain from the competent
hands of Henry Dunning MacLeod, a history
of banking in Russia by Ant. E. Horn, late edi
tor of the Journal of St. Petersburg, and a his
tory of savings banks in the United States by
John P. Townsend, president of the Bowery
Savings Bank of New York. The third and
fourth volumes contain the history of banking
iv the Latin nations, in Germany and Austria
| Hungary, in the Scandinavian nations, in Hol-
I land, Canada, China and Japan. In paper,
typography and general mate-up the series is
superb. The form is royal octavo and each
volume contains 500 pages, bound in half
morocco. The volumes are uniform in size
and binding, and the work complete is really
a monumental one.
LITERARY NOTES
A Tom Hughes memorial fnnd has been
started in England for the purpose of erecting
a life-size statue of the author at Rugby.
Messrs. Harper & Bros, have in press "Limi
tations," a new novel by E. F. Benson, and
"The Dwarfs Tailor and Other Fairy Stories,"
by Zoe Dana Underhill.
"Wheels,' ' a bicycle romance, by A Wheeler,
has just been published by G. W. Dillingham
of New York. It is a story of two rich girls
who take a bicycle trip over Europe, disguised
as brothers. The incidents of the trip are all
highly improbable and a few of them are
grossly absurd.
George W. Vanderbilt's library on forestry,
which according to reports had been held by
the custom-house authorities for duties to be
paid, is already at Biltmore. Mr. Vnnder
bilt's secretary paid the duties under protest
and the appraisers have decided that duty
was rightly charged on twenty of the volumes.
Albert Ross has written a new novel, "Love
Gone Astray," which has just been published
by G. W. Dillingham of New York. It is the
kind of novel generally excluded from the
household. The last two words of the title are
sufficient explanation of the character of the
work, and the same two words will serve to in
dicate the course in this particular instance of
the talent which produced the novel. Paper
covers; price, 50 cents.
"Mr. Gladstone at Eighty -six," by W. T

existence, nothing interests me or satisfies in the slightest that
deep longing which I find in my heart for thee, for thy love,

never known thee, never realized the life within, never known

As I muse sadly thus, there comes a â¢ gentle, ; consoling

life and joy to all that is to have a future life in me."

GINETTE'S HAPPINKSS. By "Gyp," trans
lated by Ralph Derechef. New York: R F.
Fenno <te Co., publishers.
In this, as in her other stories, Gyp deals
with some of the shortcomings of uppercrust
Parisian society. Ginette, a beauty, marries
young, not so much for love's sake as to escape
the pain of being long "on the market," and
because a fair opportunity presents itself. She
has an idea that marriage means happiness.
Her wealthy husbaud, however, allows him
self every liberty, including that of being
jealous. Ginette doesn't find the happiness
she sought, hen husband gets into politics
and employs a young man named Chavoy to
manage his campaign for office. Chavoy
waits upon Ginette much of the time during
the campaign. The husDand is defeated,
and following that defeat, society busies
itself with light talk concerning the
politicinn's spouse and Chavoy. The latter
tears himself away and departs for Algiers to
accept a new position. The parting between
.Ginette and Chavoy is painful, of course, and
the woman expresses herself as quite indif
ferent to society's opinions or convictions in
the matter. She only regrets that her happi
ness was limited to the period of the cam
paign. Gyp is always snappy and bright;
never dull. A number of errors occur in the
book, due, it would seem, to haste and care
lessness on the part of the printer.

70c.
This little volume tells in a pleasant chatty
way of some of the fine old cathedrals of Eng
land. As the author says, to some natures
every stone of these vast edifices has a voice,
every aisle a message. Destiny has forbidden
to many of these cathedral lovers the delight
of personal knowledge and intimacy. To bring
to them the very faintest echo of this voice,
this message, is the sole object of this book.
The cathedrals visited in the pilgrimage in
clude those of Winchester, Bipon, Litchfield
and Exeter.

An Irish love story with variations but a
story that holds the reader through to the end;
that is alive with action, and not lacking in
strong scenes, is the latest production of Mr.
Moore. It is readily discovered that the author
is no stranger 'to ; the ; glens and the heather
clad mountains, the blue loughs and the harp
music of â¢â  old Ireland as well as "the ocean j
music which makes those who hear it ripe .- for
revolt." In fact Mr. Moore exhibits [ a filial
fondness for the land "whose life is; the
memory of aucifent deeds of nobleness"; the
land that has' been so ; prolific of heroes and
â¢'whose inhabitants live in " thousands in
squalor and look out from mud windows upon
the most glorious scenery ' mi ' the world."
Daireen Gerald, the heroine of , the novel, is
the daughter of i an officer in the British army
and member of an old Irish family. Tne Geralds
are neighbors of the Macnamaras, the head of
which family has boasted that the ancestors of
the Mncnamaras were kings of Munster "in the
days when 1 there were "kings in Ireland, and
when the Geralds were walking about in blue
paint in the woods of the adjacent island of
Britain." Thus, when the elder Macnamara
finds that : his son Standlsh loves | the air;
Daireen, he takes occasion to teach the Geralds
how a "hereditary monarch is descending to
equalize himself with emigrants." ', The
Geralds refuse to entertain the thought of mar

LIFE OF HON. WILLIAM McKINLEY. By
Jlurat Halstead. San Francisco: Whitakor
tt Uay Company, publisher.-,. so:d only by sub
scription; cioih, $1 50; half morocco. $'J.
This most recent "Life of William McKinley"
is a veritable Republican campaign book, and,
as such, it replete with facts and information
that should be in the possession of every voter.
The author, Mural Ilalstead, has. been assisted
in the preparation of this work by M-irk
Henna, Hon. John Sherman, Governor Foraker
and others. In fact, the first chapter is from
the pen of John Sherman, who easily ranks; as
one of the ablest statesmen on finance of the
century; while the introduction is from the
eloquent pen of Chauncey M. Depew. The
book descrioes in vivid style McKinley's
brilliant career in the army, at the bur, in
Congress, in the Governor'? chair. It also tells
the whole story of the famous McKinley bill.
It tells how a wise system of reciprocity ex
tended our foreign commerce as never before,
and opened the markets oi the world to
American goods; and how McKinley has con
sistently adhered to tne great Republican
principle of honest money, the same money
for the rich man and the poor, and every
dollar worth just as much as every other
dollar, whether gold, silver or greenback. It
contains, also, that masterly argument for
protection by Hon. James G. Blaiue
in his great literary duel with the Rt. II >n.
William E. Gladstone. No man of his time
has been comparable with Mr. Gladstone, the
â¢'Grand Old Man," as a representative of Eng
lish thought and politics, and especially of the
English policy of free trade. So James G.
Blame, the "Prince Rupert of debate," was
perhaps the fittest of all Americans of his

time to answer the English champion and to
uphold the great American policy of protec
tion. The text of his masterly argument for
protection is alone worth the price of the
volume. Millions of Americans this year will
want to reread it, to refresh their minds with
the most cogent arguments ever made on the
great issue now before the Nation. Kecip
locity and its vastly beneficent effects in ex- J
tending American commerce and promoting |
the general prosperity of the country are set |
forth iv these pages in the most direct and |
lucid manner. Startling facts and figures ob
tained from official sources and never before
made public are given to show the value of
reciprocity arid the appalling losses the
farmers, workingmen and all classes of Ameri
cans have suffered through its abandonment
by the present administration. The book also
contains a powerful and lucid explanation of
the gold and silver question by Hon. Charles
Emory Smith, ex-Minister to Russia.
THE MYSTERY OF HANDWRITING
This Is a handbook of graphology, "being a
plain and practical guide to the art of inter
preting character from handwriting," by J.
Harrington Keene (Grapho). It is illustrated
with the autograph writing of famous per
sons. In the "Mystery of Handwriting" an
accomplished graphologist has undoubtedly
filled the requirement. Harrington Keene has
presented in clear, concise, practical form the
result of his long experience, and it is very
easy to follow his instructions aided by the
autograph illustrations of famous men and
women so abundantly furnished. Starting
with the assertion that handwriting is a series
of mental gestures, he leads the reader with
out mystification through the whole alphabet
of the graphological signs which experience j
has taught are present as symptoms of each
individual character. The work contains a
fine collection of fac-simile autographs of ceie
brated persons, and arguments in support of
the science are abundantly sustained by an
appeal to the known characteristics of these
celebrities. [Boston : Lee & Shepard, publish

BLIND LEADERS OP THE BLIND, the Ro
mance of a Blind Lawyer. By James K. Cocke.
Boston: Lee <fc dhepard. publishers. Cloth, price
$1 50.
The author of this book is deprived of sight,
and possibly the character of the blind lawyer
may be, in part, drawn irom some of his own
experiences. The book is at once a satirical and
occult romance. The author deals humorously
with those visionary beings who^ would reform
the world by equally visionary schemes.
Modern methods of educating the blind are
treated of in connection with the boyhood
career of the hero, Robert Neth2rland. The
blind student's college experiences are writ
ten with a light touch and a certain vein of -
humor. ,
An interesting chapter is the one in which
the blind lawyer is made to see through his
sweetheart's eyes by means of an instrument
supposed to have been discovered by a French
man. We quote a portion :
"Take this chair," Professor Vandiere said,
wheeling one into the center of the room, forget
ting that Robert could not see.
Robert arose and hesitatingly took a step for*
ward. De'htte, instantly recognizing his embar
rassment, tactfully took his hand and led him to
the chair. Robert thought it the most beautiful
hand he had ever touched. It felt soft and vel
vety, strong but slender; warm and gentle seemed
its touch. He had never held such a hand before,
and was again conscious of an ardent wish to see
De'Ette's face.
Professor Vandiere held a strange looking object
in his hand. It was a metallic rod, upon one end
of which was a small horseshoe magnet.
"You must concentrate your mind upon one
thing," said the professor. I will give you a num
berâsixteen. It does not matter what figures are
selected, but you must concentrate your miud in
tently upon whatever number is given. Think of
sixteen," he commanded: "sixteen, only sixteen."
lie waved the magnet in the air and made passes
with it. "Thinlc of sixteen, you are sixteen; you
are two figures, one and sixâ sixteen, sixteen, six
teen."
De'Ette watched Robert's face. It grew paler,
his features became set, and his face wore an c*.
pre.ssion of terror.
"Sixteen, only sixteen; you are being merged
Into two figures, one and six, sixteen. " The pro
fessor waved the magnet to and fro.
A tremor passed over Robert's face, "Close
your eyes." The lids fell. Â»
"You cannot open them." Robert tried In vain.
"Your lianas are icy cold." Kobert shivered.
Strange noises rang in his ears, lie felt himself
expanding. A terrible dread came over him; he
tried in vain to throw it off.
"Sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixteen," rang
through his head. "Sixteen, sixteen," again he
heard, and then the voice ceased to exist for him.
He felt himself whirling, whirling whirling. He
Imagined he felt the figures, one and six, upon
his finger-tips. "One, six: one. six; one, six," was
all that he felt, all that he knew. Then another
strange feeling followed. He was conscious of a
[ bright light, but did not have a name for the sen
sation. Then a bookcase, a piano and some chairs
I entered his consciousness. He knew them by their
form, but why did they glow soT "What is this?"
he thought; and then he experienced a sensation
o? pleasure. It was a new pleasure, an unnr.m
able dellqht. There was a face! He knew it whs
I a face, because .he had touched many. Such a face
and such a form, wrapped in a maze of shadowy,
delicate pink.
"Am I in heaven?" he asked.
De'Ette stood by him. The professor had first
placed the magnet upon him, then upon De'Ette.
Then, at the professor's suggestion, she took Rob
ert's hand. At this moment Robert received the
first- vision he had ever known; for the first time
he consciously perceived objects through a new
avenue, by another sense.
The action of the book is rather dramatic;
the style natural, easy and readable. The
scene of the story is laid in Boston.
KINGS IN EXILE.
! This new edition of one of Alphonse Daudet's
I works bears the imprint of the London house
of J. M. Dent & Co. The book is published in
a style and binding uniform with "Tariarin
1 of Tarascon" and "Tartarin in the Alps." The
! illustrations, which are done in a most dainty
j fashion, are by Bieler, Conconi and Myrbach.
A singular coincidence is noticeable in the
! fact that Daudet dedicated the original cdi
! tion of "Kings in Exile" to Edmond de Gon
j court, "who has written the history of queens
and favorites, and the romance of Germinie
Lacerteux and the Freres Zemganno." The
new and handsome edition of the work under
review reaches us but a few days after an
j nouncement is made of the death of De Gon
court, for whom Daudet professed a sincere
j admiration. [New York : The Macmillan Com

23A SAN FRANCISCO GIRL THREE DAYS IN THE LONDON SEASON
LONDON, England, Jnly 20.â London
during the past week has been like
a hothouse; even, when the sky was
veil^i and of a dim rose gray the heavy
airl"?at upon the windows like sunlight,
but tor the greater part of the time the
sun fias poured down upon an ungrateful
world and the perspiring iuhabitants j
thereof. j
In the studios it ha? been especially
sultry, and dim twilight effects and grace
fully somnolent attitudes have been tem
porarily popular. The Hies alone have
waxed and grown fat and have shown an
increasing cheerful activity.
Outside in the great world the streets
are alive with people; the season has
burst into a second crop of entertain
ments, the parks are paeeants, the thea
ters and the opera ere crowded to the
doors. The gowns in the carriages are of
an almost tropical smartness, and the
flowers .in the hats blaze and bob like
lanterns in a high wind.
In a few weeks old newspapers will be
pressed against the glass doors and win
dows of the houses in Mayfair and Park
Lane, and London will settle into a mid
summer dreariness and desolation. A few
million people will pursue their ordinary
vocations with a hollow assumption of
enjoyment, and the daily papers will
chronicle the movements of the distin
guished at the various watering places.
Three days ago my friend Mrs. Whiteha
entered the torrid atmosphere of the
studio. She brought a wave of freshness
with herâ a freshness that was partly the
crisp coolness of her white gown, partly
tbe roses that flourished in her hat, prin
cipally the breeze that seemed always to
flutter Her garments and her hair and her
speech. On that day, however, her face
seemed inextinguishably radiant.
"I've come for you," she announced,
with that calm certainty of expectation
that is a triumph in itself. "We've a lot
of invitations and dances and things and
teas and the opera. That Mr. Thing
ummy â you remember him, I said he
looked like a boiled owl â he wants us to
have tea on the terrace."
"What's the terrace?" demanded Miss
Yerdantina Grey from an inner room, in
which she was improving her opportuni
ties for tbe cultivation of her mind with a
pair of scissors, a great many pins in her
mouth and a very deeply absorbed ex
pression.
Mrs. Whitehat lifted her angelic eyes
to mine with the deepest reproach and
dropped four or five 'invitations and visit
ing cards.
"It is something you'll like," she re
plied. "You'll love it It's to go to
dinner â to a studio dinner. You know
Mr. Langham Graves â it's at his studio;
bo I accepted for you, of course. I knew
you'd be charmed. And thenâ why then
we go to Mrs. Jooling Rowe; she's going
to giveâ a fancy-dress ball."
"A fancy-dress!" I echoed. "And may
I inquire what your fancy dress is to beâ
and mine?"
Of course we went. Mrs. Whitehat
had a formidable list of arrangements
which covered every Hour of three days
between 4 in the afternoon and 1 at night.
We went first to an "At Home." Mrs.
Whitehat prepared our minds for us be

nounced, "and so is her sister. She is
very big indeed and awfully musical and

GOLD MINING BY POOR MEN
Some Suggestions to Those Searching for Work
The publication in The Call of lest
Sunday of an article stating that any man
willing to work could make a living at
gold-mining with the old-fashioned cradle
or sluicebox has attracted a great deal of
attention from men interested in such
subjects. Many business men have de
clared ihat they have advocated gold
mining as a relief for bard times ever
since the industrial depression started.
The general opinion is that men can do
better in California than in Alaska.
The opinions of different men have
been most varied. Many old miners have
declared that the amount stated by The
Call as possible for a man to earn is
much too low; others declared it was just
about right. Several other men, pot
miners, declared that the whole idea was
unreasonable. They said they had tried
it and found that it would not work. But
questioning of these men showed that they
had not tried it as suggested in The Call.
They had expected to make a fortune in a
few hours, and finding they could not gave
it up as useless.
A man giving his name as Herbert Green
said that he had tried it a lew weeks ago
in Yuba County. He was completely dis
gusted. He said he worked for an hour in
the not aun and took ont only 3 cents'
worth of gold. Mr. Green, however, failed
to consider that if he had worked twelve
hours he would have taken out 36 cents'
worth, even though he had no better luck
than he had the first hour. This small
amount would have been enough to
have bought all the food he needed for the
day, and another day's work might have
brought him in a large amount. In fact,
he might be considered to have b.-en in
pretty good luck, and had he kept on he
would not now be walking the streets of
San Francisco and attempting to live on
a pood deal less, such as he can obtain by
different methods. But, of course, he
had to work ihere, and he doesn't here.

to what was the best locality for a man to
work with a cradle so as to make enough
to live on brought tiie information that

It has been estimated that millions of

a man to work in order to get some of it.
There is many times more gold in the
mountains thaa has ever been tasen out,
and there is room for 100,000 men to work
at getting it.

do best if he will go deep into the moun

The house faced a square and was about
as broad as an elevator shaft. Some very
ponderous females, evidently British ma
trons, went in before us, and in their
shadow two very tall girls, with round
shoulders and tight sleeves, whispered to
each other and exchanged sighs and
glances of the most profound anguish.
"It's a beast of a place to be dragged to!"
I heard one of them murmur, "nothing

"Yes, mother," murmured the daughter
addressed, and gave her companion a
savage pinch.
The entry was so microscopic that it
seemed almost necessary to press against
the wall and enter the tearoom sideways.
The tearoom was crowded, everybody ex
hibiting a ravenous appetite and a sname
less haste about satisfying it.
Three neat maids hurried distractedly
from one side of the table to the other and
kept up a timid flow of nervous interroga
tions, to which we could hear the answers
in voice of every range and quality from
a mumbling and majestic bass to a mere
little silver thread of sound.
'â¢Yes, if you plaase, a little more straw

tuce sandwich. Yes, I would like another
ice, and just a little more tea. Yes, two
lumps, and cream."
We followed Mrs. Whitehat's example
and industriously consumed everything
we could reach ; then we once more joined
the procession ana sidled up the stairs to
greet our hostess.
A tremendous blast of sound reverber
ated in the hall; a stout gentleman with
pale red whiskers was asseverating at the
very top of his voice that he would ride away
and be free. We could just see his head
over a crowd of bonnets, and his expres-

"Let us go in now," murmured Miss
Grey, "I'm stifling. He seems to be over

"Wait a moment!" sighed Mrs. White
hat, "he may have a relapse."
When the tumultuous applause had sub
sided we presented our cards to the solemn
men whose duty it evidently was to an
nounce as. This terrible function was
performed with a brutal dlstinctiveness
in which the world was informed that we
were the happy originals who possessed
such names as Miss Wildcat and Miss
Hay. My own humble title subsided into
a grunt.
Mrs Whitehat entered the room with a
chastened expression; her eyes demnrely
cast down, the graceful gravity of ber
manner was something to remember with
awe. She greeted her hostess with a deep

respect, presenting her remarks with a
timidity that suggested that these flowers
of speech would wilt promptly unless en
couraged.
The room was full of the flipflap of fans
and disjointed sentences rose suddenly
like mild explosives from sudden lulls of
conversation, and then after the little pop
fell down again into a shocked silence.

The fact that a man named Patterson
was working a mine on the ocean beach,
a few miles below the Golden Gate Park,
was mentioned at tbe Mining Bureau, and
it was claimed that be had been making
about $2 50 a day. A Call representative
visited Patterson and came away with a
confused idea as to the real facts of the
case, so the reader will have to judge for
himself.
Patterson has been at work in his pres
ent location for nearly five years, and

and secluded spot Mrs. Wbitehat has
chosen to abide in. She regards them
with a beautiful calmness, each cool and
limpid glance impaling one of them as
surely as a pin impales a fluttering butter
fly. They exhibit the most praiseworthy
solicitude for ber comfort, almost pull a
chair from under the slowly rising form of
an immortal who has only thought of
going. They pick up her handkerchief
and cardcase (she is perpetually dropping
something), and when she smiles upon one
of them with a little murmur of gratitude,
he writhes down upon the floor and sits
on a stool at her feet, with his own almost

when he first went out there he declared
to the representatives of the different San
Francisco papers that he had only a few
dollars. His plant consisted of a sluice
box and a hole in the ground, where he
caught seepage water. His habitation
was a very poor tent. Patterson used to
dig his ?and from tbe hillside near by,
throw it into his sluice- bpx and dip the
water out of the seepage hole with a dip
per of the crudest description. Contrast
that with his present surroundings. He
has two good houses and a workshop. A
windmill pumps the water into tanks, so
that it is under nis control at all times.
His washing machinery is nearly all
homemade, but it is quite elaborate and
capable of handling considerable sand.
When seen by a Cali, man Patterson was
very uncommunicative. He admitted that
he was taking out a little gold, but was
disinclined to talk at all. Some of his
neighbors say that he is making big
money and others say that he is not mak
ing anything. That is the way the case
stands, but the fact that Patterson has in
creased his plant so would seem to indi
cate that he has been making something.
It is known that there is plenty of gold in
the sand on the ocean beach, but it is very
fine and hard to catcii. A man could
hardly be advised to try hia luck on the
sea shore, but men are going to do it. J.
Eastwood is putting in a small plant not
far from Patterson's and several others
will soon be started farther down the
coast.
The Call's article has called forth in
quiries from several inventors who hare
machines that they think will turn the
gold out by the ton. They figure that if a
man and a cradle can make a dollar
a day their machines can make ten times
that much, if they can only go to the
same place. But all of the machines ex
amined had some "if." One of them
needed a big stream of water and a flume;
another weighed seveial tons; it could do
as much work in one day as a man could
in three weeks. As many of the gravel
pits will not keep a man busy a week it
will be seen that tbe machine would have
to be moved two or three times every day.
Not one of the machines would fill the
place of the man and the cradle.
The accompanyine drawings will give
an idea of the construction of the cradle
and sluice-box. Any man can make them
of a few boards that can be cut to the re
quired shape and then carried to tbe
mining country. The idea of digging a
hole for the water to run into after it has
passed through the machine and then
using it over again is a good suggestion
for places where water is scarce. It is by
this method a few barrels of water will
wash several tons of sand. The larger box
can only be used by men who have the
money to buy a large amount of quick
silverâthat is, about $4 worth. But it
will hold a large amount of gold, making
it necessary to "clean up" not more than
once a week.

The evening was perfect, like a softened j
daylight; the trees in the parks were !
wrapping themselves in delicate veils of
mist.
We permitted ourselves the delicious ex
travagance of a hansom, and were soon
one of the innumerable carriages on the
way to Coven t Garden.
Â» * â¢ * Â«
Mrs. Whitehat did not spare as one de
tail of her programme for the three days
she had determined upon. In that heavy
and sweltering heat, we attended teas and
dances and the third day we spent ardu
ously arranging costumes for the fancy
dress ball, which was to end this period of
festivity. By this time 1 felt ten years
older; Mrs. Whitehat had not lost one
touch of her inexhaustible radiant charm.
The studio to wnich we were invited to
dine was an ideal one, great lofty rooms
opening upon an English lawn, with old
fashioned flowers growing in prim rows
along the low stone walls, and over it the
sheep grazing under the great trees of an
English park.
Our bost, Langham Graves, met us
with an expression of delight.
Mrs. Wbitehat was certainly the old
picture she bad intended to be. Soft curls
fell forward over her flushed cheeks, ana
a great monument of hair uprose in coils
and twists most intricate and "teinarkable
for to see!" She was as demure as a
China shepherdess. Yerdantina was a
Spanish dancer, all in vivid crimson (ah!
the tears and despair of that costume!)
Our host was as brilliant as a bird of
paradise or tbe macaw that screeched con
tinually and swore benind oar chairs.
Mrs. Whitehat affirmed he was a "sweet
bird," but she remained at a respectable
distance from him and confided to us
afterward that it was very distracting to
have that piratical animal squawking be
hind ber.
Our host was severely classic; bis velvet
mantle was worn with a carelessly regal
out food," be told a Call man. "Then a
kind-hearted baker sent me a biscuit."
His is a pitiful tale. He is known as
Captain Arthur Kelly, and at present is
occupying a room in a ten-cent lodging
house on Oregon street. That he is there
is due to tbe kindness of heart of the land
lady, as he has no money to even pay his
rent. Nor has be had for two weeks. Al
though the landlady can give him a room
at a great sacrifice to herself, she is too
poor to give him food. She makes very
little money, and has a family of her own
air; his auburn hair was tightly curled
and he smiled rarely; his costume did not
call for smiles it was all velvet and satin
and heavy silver trimmings like a coffin.
A Knight Templar took Miss Grey under
his charge, and my escort was a melan
oholy man in evening clothes, who had
powdered his nair and his mustache and
wore a wearily polite and superior smile.
The fancy-dress ball was a fancy-dress
ballâ that is to say incongruous figure 3
mingled in the dance, matadors and harle
quins and fairies and Turkish ladies and
Swiss peasants flirted and danced.
Mrs. Whitehat pursued her triumphs to
the last; the door was always blocked with
a crowd or clowns and monks and courtiers
of the last century who pressed forward
Ito see her dance. Dancing in England
means a breathless whirl in one direction
and then a pause, and then another whirl,
"madly, wildly, passionately.' 1
Langham Graves danced with his
royal mant.'e and Mrs. Whitehat, he
seemed unwilling to discard eitherâ both
testified mutely to his glory. The furious
envy with which he was regarded he
ignored with solemnity. And Mrs. White
bat returned after each dance, as did little
I Miss Grey, and we compared notes.
My melancholy escort fell a victim at
last and led Mrs. Whitehat through a
funereal quadrille. She returned to me in
I wrath.
"He kept showing me everybody," she
explained in enraged tones. " 'Do you see
that woman with tier toes turned in?' be
would ask, 'that is tbe cleverest woman in
the room ! Do you see that woman with
the Turkish costume and the gold benâ
that is tbe most beautiful woman in the
room!' I never knew such an idiot!"
Langham Graves compensated for
| everything ; he danced with a grace and
speed that Mrs. Whitehat affirmed were
divine. "He dances like a white man,"
she explained and led him back like a
lamb to the sacrifice.
Poor Mr. Graves was a hero; he went on
and on, his knees knocking togetber at
last, his hair first uncurling slowly and
standing up straight all over his head and
then collapsing into damp strings. His
mantle was a crumpled velvet heap in one
corner. Between tne dances he would go
out and gather strength at the buffet,
which was decorative and varied in
the extreme; or wander out into
the garden, in which the Chinese
lanterns swung gayly, and the weird
figures passed between the trees and over
the smooth lawn like gay and grotesque
shadows. At midnight I suggested tim
idly that it was time to go home; little
Miss Grey had been crippled early in the
evening by a determined Spanish bull
fighter, who danced as though he were
killing a bull. My escort had grown more
and more gloomy and bad ended by re
lapsing into a sardonic silence. And still
Mrs. Whitehat danced and danced and
danced. Finally Miss Grey and I rose
solemnly; we were about to rebel. We
placed a hand on Mrs. Wbitehat's arm ; she
looked down at us, and her lovely smiie
and her unimpaired freshness was some
thing to marvel at. "Home? Why, cer
tainly!" she declared, and tnen in a whis
per, "It's been a little of a bore, don't you
think?"
A carriage was called and our melan
choly escort prepared to see us home, but
as the carriage turned we could see Mr.
Langham Graves sink into a chair under a
bobbing Chinese lantern, dripping tallow
tears, with his head forward and his arms
hanging listlessly at his side.

to provide for. But, unable as she is to
keep him, she has not tiie heart to turn
the old man out into the street to die.
Kelly is a stranger to San Francisco,
although he was a California pioneer of
'49. He came here from Portland, Or.,
about three weeks ago in search of wealthy
relatives, as he became too old to work
and his sons and daughters turned hiru
out. Since be has been here Kelly has
been through an experience such as few
men have to pass through, particularly
old men. With his age and infirmities it
seems a miracle that he is alive.
"John Kelly of the banking firm of
Donohoe & Kelly was my brother," said
the old man while sealed in his dingy
room. "The first Mrs. Donohoe was my
sister, and we all came to California to
gether in 1849. John, who became the
banker, remained in this City, bnt I
stayed only a few years and then deter
mined to try my luck in the Sound coun
try. From the first luck came my way.
I had large interests in the lumber busi
ness, owned a couple of small ranches and
a steamboat, and was really pros
perous."
In additionto working for his own in
terests Kelly, according to his own story,
has worked for his country. He distin
guished himself in the Indian wars of
1855 and also in 1856. When Governor
Chadwick called for volunteers he was
one of the first to come forward. It was
he who, single-handed and alone, captured
one of the most belligerent of the Indian
chiefs and so ended the trouble and
brought about peace between the Oregon
authorities and the red men.
Officially Arthur Kelly has served six
teen years as Sheriff in different parts of
Oregon. Part of the time was spent in
Multnomah County and part at The Dalles.
He also served as deputy sheriff at The
Dalles under James Crawaon.
Until about fifteen years ago things
came Kelly's way. He was prosperous
and bis children were all doing well. At
that time he was worth nearly $100,000 and
in the best of health.
Just what was the start of Kelly's trouble
he does not remember, but he knows that
after a certain lawsuit his money beean to
go. Gradually he had less and less, and
his children wanted to have less and less
to do with him. When he bad nothing at
ail they turned him out to shift for
himself.
For the last five years Kelly has, he says,
managed to earn his own living, although
he was compelled to live in cheap board
ing-houses. His sons and daughters were
ail married, but they would have nothing
to do with him. They would not even
board him unless he paid in advance.
Once he got sick and not one of them
came to see him. They said they had
enough to do to take care of themselves
without having to look out for an old man.
This i 3 the story as Captain Arthur, Kelly
himself tells it.They Gather
Starfish for
the Schools
A business has lately been established in
San Francisco that is most likely the only
one of its kind in existence. To be sure,
it has made no flurry "on change," and so
far there is no sign of competition. But,
then, the business is not a very lucrative
one. Still, those engaged in it are satis
fied with the returns and willing that it
should last.
The fact of the establishment of the
business makes it necessary to state that
a use has been found for the starfish.
Some people may state that it has long
been useful in the way of ornamenting
mantels and making seashell collections.
But the use to which it has lately been put
is greater than all of these. It is that of
serving as models to teach children how
to draw.
It was some time last March that the
teachers of the schools in the northern
part of town introduced the starfish as an
adjunct to their method of instructing
young minds in the matter of delineating
form on paper. From the first the scheme j
was a success and the children made more j
rapid progress than had ever been known
before. The reason for this is due to the
fact that starfish are all alike and yet very I
unlike. All have five points and a row of !
queer-looking little lumps down the cen- !
ter of each. It is easy enough for a child I
to "see" these, and also easy to make it
see that in no two of the creatures do the
points turn in the same. Some of them !
are very symmetrical and straight, while
others seem to all turn one way and have
all the curves of the proverbial ram's
horn. These differences are what cause
character, the same as can be seen in the
human face, and by teaching the children
Jar\ Skoes
Qoir\g Out.
The red shoes are going. This is not a
joke concerning their movement as they
are propelled, but an announcement that
they are falling into disuse. This discov
ery has been made by a representative of
The Call on Market street, the great
thoroughfare of the Pacific Coast, upon
which all the customs and manners of the
peoples who dwell west of the Sierras
have exposition. A few months hence
and the red shoe will be as rare as the
extinct dodo.
Where there were a dozen pairs of red
shoes on the feet of Market-street pedes
trians a year ago, there are less than
half a dozen now. The same phenome
non of the decadence of their popularity
has been observed at the seaside, at the
country hosteiries, and wherever civilized
men and women hare appeared in public
during the present summer. Hotel clerks
have noticed it ; social philosophers have
moralized because of the fickleness of the
public taste; bootblacks have chuckled
because, while their thews and sinews
have been exercised, a shining and un
ceasing stream of nickels has trickled into
their coffers. The well-dressed man now
covets the velvety black eloss to adorn
his shoes which only the skill of the pro
fessional bootblack is competent to pro
vide.
A leading shoe-dealer confirmed the ob
servations made by the representative of
The Call who was looking into this Bub
ject. "Another year," he said, "will see
the red shoe as uncommon as it was dur
ing its first appearance. There are many
less calls for red shoes tban there were one
year ago. W fast is the reason? I cannot
give you one. The shoe-dealers generally
are glad that the public are taking this
turn. The returning preference for black
shoes will enable thÂ« dealers to carry on
buoiness with much less capital. The red
shoe has appeared in the same variety as
the black footwear, button, iaced, high
and low. This has made it necessary to
keep up practically a double stock, as we
have to meet demands for all sizes and
styles in both red and black shoes.
"I am surprised at the varieties of styles
there are in shoes although I have been
familiar with the business many years.
The shapes of toes, the shapes of heels
and the descriptions of curves are many.
Now so far as I have been able to learn
there is no special reason why the red
shoe be abandoned. No ultra fashionable
has decreed it. This appears to be a case
where the public has tired of a fad. The
red shoe first came into common use in
San Francisco about 1893 and for two years
its local popularity continually increased.
It came from the first in all varieties,
like butterflies for inutance.
to see it the drawing-lesson was an easy one.
Of course to use starfish for the purpose
of instruction it was necessary to have
\ plenty of them, and when school was 'in
I session the teachers used to send the good
I boya out to get them. The boys liked the
job, and it was astonishing what slow
work it was to gather a few dozen of star
fish. This plan worked very well, how
ever, and there were always plenty of
j models on hand.
It was after school closed for the sum
mer that the boys thought of making a
business of starfish collecting. The girls
were, of course, then most interested in
drawing, but it was a difficult task for I
them to get starfish to keep up their j
studies during vacation. The only way to j
do was to bribe the boys to go out and get j
specimens for them. That is the way the
business started.
Some of the boys have made consider
able money out of the work. Two or
three days of each week they spend out at
North Beach picking the starfish from
the rocks. It is pleasant work for boys,
and some of them ?tay out there all day.
They usually take a big basket with them,
and at low tide simply climb over the
rocks picking up any and ail specimens
that are within reach. Each of the boys has
regular customers and they sell the star
fish for 5 cents apiece. Some of the eirls
buy two or three every week. The best
part of it for the boys is that the starfish
do not "keep" very well. After one of
them has served as model for a day or
two it is no longer fit for service. If it
was the girls would trade them among
themselves and so do the boys out of a
fine easy business.

THE SAIST. FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
The Laziest
Mule in the
Golden State
The laziest mule in
all California is the
one on the Farallon
Islands that beloncs
to the lighthouse
keepers. He is the
successor of the late
lamented "Jerry"
and is known to bis
owners as "Patsey."
In many ways he is a
smart rnuie, but he
devotes most of his
talents to devising
means to avoid the
little work that is required 01 him. The strange thine about his
plan is that he goes to more work to avoid work than it would
tatce him to do it.
Patsey has been on the island for about three years, and
from the start seemed pleased with his home. He Was brought
out on the steamer Madrona and at once given full liberty-
He roamed over the
island at will, and as
no work was required
of him he was the
happiest mule in the
stall.
But a day came
when Patsey was not
happy. It was after
he had been on the
island three months
and the Madrona
came back on her
quarterly visit. He
then found out what
he was there for. As
soon as the supplies
were landed on the
wharf Patsey had to
haul them to the
lighthouse. And, oh,
what hard work he
found ie after his
three months' vaca
tion. Every pound
was a ton and his un
willingness made it
about three. He has
never forgotten that
day.
The next time the
Madrona came back
Patsey was ready.
The first visit of the
steamer made such
an impression on him
that he even recog
nized the whistle as
the sound came over
the water through a
thick bank of fog.
When the supplies
were on the landing
Patsey was nowhere
to be found. Search
for him as they would
it was the next day
before he was uuwill
ingly at work.
The next time the
steamer came the
keepers were ready
for Patsey 'a trick. Ab
soon as he heard the
whistle a shiver pass-
Ed over him and he started for one of the highest hills on the
island, never stopping until he had reached the top, all the
DON'T PUT MONEY IN YOUR MOUTH
"Did you notice that?" asked Dr. J. J.
Clarke of this City to me as we were rid
ing on a Sutter-street car.
What he drew attention to was a
Chinese passenger who, when asked for
his fare, took a nickel from the interior of
his left ear and gave it to the conductor.
"A queer place for carrying money," I
said. "I know of many odd places that
people carry money in. but that is the
oddest."
"It was with a view of drawing: your at
tention to a dangerous practice that I
asked you to look at that Chinaman,'" said
the doctor, and then he nudged me to j
look in the direction of a well-dressed j
lady who had but a moment before taken i
her seat and was fumbling in her purse ]
for her fare. She found the coin she was |
If the excellence, the variety and the number of
clubs, all tending to better thq soda' side of man's
life, be any indication of the condition of society,
then San Francisco need have no fears for her
reputation. For In all of these qualities in regard
to clubdom the City by the Golden Gate though
young in years occupies a position far in advance
of many of her older rivals. Indeed the fact that a
city can present associations of menâ clubs If you
willâ the outgrowth of a high development, intel
lectually, socially or physically, Is proof of Its
social advancement. This condition, It may be
assumed, reflects the culture and refinement of the
community. And as San Francisco clubs in their
own respective spheres are the peer of any other
city's civic pride should extend to them.
The clubmen themselves are proud of their or
ganization. Meet a Ban Francisco clubman any
where on earth and in five minutes he will have
told you some'hing, a story perhaps, or a vivid de
scription of hla own clubhouse. He may talk to
you of Bohemia, the club known all over the globe
wherever art is understood or good-fellowship ap
preciated; or, perhaps, the conversation may drift
Into the subject of physical culture, and then
world's record and salt-water swimming tanks ana
other things will be mixed np in connection with
the Olympic Club. The Press Club may be men
tioned. Those nights with the cream of Bohemia,
those late watches! And the wit, the glorious
voices and divine musicians from everywhere!
Ah. those late watches! Nothing like them in all
the wide world. Mere memories of those nights
when everything goes but the clock. And so on
to the end. Each one unique, each most Interest-
Ing to the stranger, who, if he is anybody, must
have canght something of the fame of San Fran
cisco clubs.
Perhaps In no more striking way ts this self
esteem better expressed than in the characteristic
emblems and mottoes adopted by the different
clubs. If the club have a strong individuality
the more distinctive is its crest or emblem The
emblems are fostered and paraded with becoming
conceit until each Is Intangibly associated with a
club's name and traditions. And then at last they
breathe inspirations. They betray the very es
sence or spirit of the clubs. Can anything In its
way be more eloquent of the athlete and his attrt
er day the same performance has to be gone through.
On one occasion the Madrona happened to be in the vicinity,
possibly chasing an escaped whistling-buoy, and gave a long
blast of the whistle. Patsey was not expecting anything of the
kind, and at once became filled with fear.
There was no time to climb the peak, so he flew over the

1 to the island is that Patsey should have been a tramp.
in search of and placed it betwen her
lips while she closed her purse, and then
taking the coin from her mouth, held it in
her hand until it was called for.
"I suppose you paw that lady place that
coin between her lips/* 1 asked the doctor.
"Yes; whatofthat? I've seen that done
a hundred times."
"Did it ever occur to yon that the prac
tice is a dangerous one and the source of
more disease than many people imagine?
Does that lady kuow where the coin'was
before she placed it in her mouth? May
it not have been in the ear of her Chinese
launu'ryman or cook, or may it not have
been in the pocket of some individual af
fected with a contagious disease? If it
was in the ear of an individual
who had an affection of that or
butes than the winged O of the Olympics, or the
owl of the Bohemians with their motto "Weav
ing spiders come not here"?
Of course there Is nothing new In clubs adopt nc
mottoes. As far back as history goes there are
otorlesof crests and emblems. The Romans car
ried the motto "8. y. Q. R." on their standards.
By this Irony of repetition of history people nowa
days nearer home bow before the sign, '"S. P. R.
K." However, that is another stoÂ»JK as Kipling
nsed to say in bis tales of India. 80 the clubs of
Ban Frfincisco have followed in the groove and set
up their standards.
Probably none of the local clubs makes more o"
Its crest thp.n the Bohemian Club. One never
hears of a jinks or Indeed any function of this
organization without stumbling across that old
wise owl of theirs. Ie makes an attractive emblem
does this same owl with the fluttering wings and
watchful eye. and so it serves its purpose. Once;
a time the dignified bird was associated with the
motto, "Weaving spiders come not here," but
then the club was truly Bohemian. But even If
the club's character has changed and the men
who make It live in luxury his owlgnip still retains
an honored perch, for they are patr ns of art in
its fullest sense and are with Bohemia if not of it.
In point of years the Olympic Club's emblem
stands first, while as a typical crest it lacks noth
ing by comparison with others. The club has
made this design Its official seal. The original
emblem of the Olympics was designed by Arthur
and Charles Nalii in 1860, and then recognized by
the club as Its official crest. That was in the days
of the San Francisco Olympic Club when the la:e
General John McComb was its president. Out of
the old organisation grew the present magnificent
institution, which tuok up the first design, with
slight modifications, as its emblem. The crest is
also used as a badge by members, and has been
fashioned many a time In diamonds, rubles and
sapphires as souvenirs to distinguished members.
The emblem of the Press Clnb was designed by
Briggs, who found his inspiration for the Idea in
the club's motto:
Let the world slide,
liet the world go,
A fig for care.
A fig for woe.
time giving utterance
to moans of anguish.
To climb the summit
was an awful task,
and Patsey was wet
with perspiration
when he got there.
Of course he was soon
captured and brought
back, and no doubt
he found his work
much harder for his
unnecessary exercise.
But it failed to cure
him and every steam-
rocks to a cave. The
entrance was a rugged
one, but Fatsey man
aged to get in and, as
be thought, was out
of danger of work.
It was two days
before Patsey was
missed, and a long
search was necessary
to find him. And
then the fun com
menced. It was easy
enough to get in, but
getting out was an
other matter. In fact,
Patsey couid not do
it unaided, which was
the reason he stayed
there so long.
Blocks and tackle
and several hours'
hard work were ne
cessary to get the
frightened mule out,
and when at last he
mustered tip courage
to look at the wharf
and saw no boxes
there be was a most
foolish-looking mule.
Patsey has got so
that he knows when
the steamer Is com
ing without hearing
the whistle. He
knows when it is due
to a day. Two or
three days before the
time he will make
himself scarce. On
one occasion the ves
sel was several days
in making a landing
and poor Patsey was
nearly starved, but
he never got hungry
enough to overcome
his aversion to work.
The keepers get con
siderable amusement
out of Patsey 's un
willingness to work.
They don't mind it,
particularly as they
can the microbes of the disease would
ding to the coin and when placed
between the lips, if there should happen to
be a cold sore there, or, as it often happens,
a rupture of the tissue, the gcrrus of dis
ease would find lodgment there and the
party guilty of the practice would wonder
how it happened that there was anything
the matter with her. The microbes of
contagious disease will attach themselves
to coin, and now you can see how easy it
is to transmit disease, not only by a coid
sore or a lip that is what is commonly
called 'cracked,' but by inhalation.
"The practice," added the doctor, with
some vehemence, "is not only dangerous,
but it is positively disgusting, and I can
not understand why so many ladies are
given to it."
The University Club, the youngest of all, has
now reached that point where a crest and motto
are desirable. Kruce Por.er has suggested a de
sign, classic in every particular, consisting Of a
shield with a Bacchanalian staff, an open book, a
Roman lamp, and the motto In early Roman
letters: "Lux, Veritas. Comltas " This design 13
now under consideration, and will be adopted with
slight alterations.
The most luxuriously appointed club of all. the

than thirty years, from the early days of the or

The Mill Valley Country Club, mostly composed
of San Franciscans, has a neat emblem In a

The Country Club's emblem, of which Its mem
bers are proud, is the deer'g head made famous by
Landieer's picture. As deer stalking over the
Marin mountains shares largely with the social
pleasures of the aristocratic organisation the
emblem is regarded as particularly appropriate.
The St. George Club has adopted St. George and
the dragon encircled by what is technically
termed a garter.
The Scottish Thistle Club uses the emblem of
Scotlandâ : be thistleâ which signifies defiance.
Its motto is; "The Clans of the uaol, shoulder to

Among the clubs that have no emblems are the

Strangt Diet
of Far allon
Island Rabbits
Students of natural history are continu
ally finding some stranae habit developed
or partly developed in the animals of Caiv
fornia. The reason for this is that there
i 3 such a variety of climate and conditions
within a comparatively small area that
the creatures simply adapt themselves to
the locality in which they happen to be.
In no other part of the world can one get
such changes of temperature with so little
change in location altitude as can be found
between this City and San Jose or Stock
ton. Nor can such radically different
islands be found so close to the mainland
as the Farallones are when compared to
the coast of California.
Such being the case it is but natural that
the creatures living there should be rad
ically different from the rest of their tribe
in other pnrts of the world. But even so,
it is hard to conceive of rabbits eating raw
fish. And yei that is what they do on the
Farallones. They have been seen in the
act, and should one be inclined to doubt
the word of the men who make the state
ment there is no denying the fact that
there is nothing else for them to eat. It
is also known tbat rabbits are big eaters
and if they were deprived of food they
would soon cease to exist.
To count all of the rabbits on the Far
allones would be an endless task and cer
tainly require at least six figures to express
the number. They are there by the thou
sands and all seem healthy.
Even in the rainy season the islands
are almost devoid of vegetation, and such
as it is do?s not seem calculated to make
good eating even for rabbits. The plants
are very few and of slow growth. They
are also lacking in nourishment, being of
the lichen and moss varieties. Certainly,
even when the islands are in their
greenest there is not enough to sustain
one-tenth of the rabbits that live there.
The statements|of the lipht-keepers and
egg-pickers are that the rabbits live on the
myriads of dead fish that are washed
ashore every day. They will'eat any kind,
I although they fieem to prefer shellfish to
all others. At any hour of th 9 day the
rabbits can be seen along the shore hunt
; ins the rocks for food.
When the rabbits are eating the fisti
! they look very much as they do when
j they are eating cabbage, and nibble it in
i the same way. They do not seem to be
the least particular as to the condition of
the fish they are eating and will make a
meal off one that has lain on the rocks
I a week just as soon as from one that has
I just been washed ashore. It is interesting
! to know that the rabbits that live on the
! Farallones have contracted their present
J mode of living within the last thirty
] years, as they are the descendants of
I tame rabbits that were brought there by
! the first lighthouse-keepers. They are not
las pretty a3 their ancestors. In fact they
' have become very lean and haggard look
-1 ing and have much the appearance of a
! half-starved coyote. But the fact that
I they have adapted themselves to their
j new conditions is only another example to
J show that there is some foundation for the
; Darwinian theory. However, it might be
well to state that tame rabbits that are
raised with chickens have been known to
eat scraps of meat and other refuse from
j the kitchen.
A strange thing about the Farallon rab
I bits that eat shellfish is that they seem to
, be struck by some sort of plague about
j once a year. At such times they will die
by hundreds, and on one occasion the
island was nearly depopulated. The sick
â¢ ness always comes after the rainy season,
j when the green feed is at its best. Pos
sibly mixing the decayed fish and green
food n.<ay be the cause of the trouble.
Blossoms
for Tots
In the southern part of the City there is
a section south of Harrison street, between
Sixth and Ninth, that is known as "fac
toryville," from the fact that there are so
many factories there. In that section
there is located the Stanford Primary
School, in which on every school day 400
little ones congregate for instruction, and
none of the pupils are over 10 years of age.
These as a rule are the children of poor
people who live in close quarters in the
district, and who have not the advantages
of the children of parents who are in bet*
ter circumstances and have neither the
room nor the opportunity to indulge in
any of the fancies that may possess
them. These children of the poor, as well
as those who are more fortunate, have an
innate love for flowers, and this is evi
denced by the pleasure they take in the
garden that has been set out in the school
house yard.
Nearly every schoolhouse has a garden
within the inclosure on which it stands,
and these are cared for by a public
gardener, but it is a question whether any
is more highly prized by the littie ones
than ia the one at the Stanford Primary.
It is not very extensive, but it contains a
great variety. There are sweet pea? in
every shade with tendrils clinging to
the walls sending out their sweet
scented blossoms, single dahlias in many
colors that are attractive to the eye
I though devoid of scent, gladiolus reach
i ing high and suggestive of Jacob's ladder,
sweet roses from delicate to deep hues,
lobelia that iorms a pretty border ol blue,
pansies that afford an extraordinary at
traction for the little ones, and many
other specimens of those beauties that
nature has provided for the gratification
of mankind.
"These little ones whose homes are such
tbat they have no room for garden
patches," said Miss Edith H. Crowley, the
principal, "all seem to have that love of
flowers that appears to De a natural im
planted passion without debasing motive.
They cannot, as I just said, have a garden
at home for want of space, but they do
display their love for flowers by planting
slips in oyster-cans, broken bottles and
other receptacles that are of no service,
and once in a while some little one brings
a 'treasure 1 to put in the school garden.
The little ones we have will not cull a
flower here, but they spend a good deal of
their spare time in watching the plants
growing, and many watch particular
plants day by day with as much solicitude
as a mother watches her baby to notice
the coming out of the first tooth. They
will come to me with the information that
a new flower had come out. Many of
them are too yonng to know the flowers by
name, so they designate, (hem by color.

August
While walking is not in itself an exer
cise sufficient for the perfect and symmetri
cal development of the body there is really
no other form of outdoor pleasure so uni
versally possible for women. Hunting,
boating, swimming, wheeling, riding, ten
nis, golf â the whole list presupposes some
condition not universally present; but
every human being possessing two feet
and fair health ought to be able to walk
-for pleasure. Here in California we have
apparently cherished a superstition that
walking is not a possible exercise. "You
will find you cannot walk here as you have
been in the habit of doing 'bacK East,' "
a woman physician said to me when I
first came to this coast, some years since.
As a matter of fact, I ba/e walked farther,
more constantly and more easily here in
California than I ever did elsewhere. Let
us disabuse our minds for good and all of
the notion that there is anything about
the glorious climate of California inimical
to pedestrianism.
There are peculiar inducements, espe
cially about the bay, for tramping parties.
During the summer months, while the
trades are blowing, tramps upon this side
are not wholly pleasant; but across the
Day, readily accessible to any good walker,
are canyons beyond number that invite
the tramper to their cool depths. August
is not the most beautiful season even in
the canyons, but it is perhaps the best
month in the year for visiting these spots.
The early springtime, if you are in
terested in tbe wild flowers, is the loveliest
of all seasons, but then you must not
linger. The ground, the green foliage, the
trees and shrubs are dripping, and the
tired tramper who seeks rest before mov
ing on is liable to pay for it with
a cold. But in August even
the canyons are warm and dry,
while the streams, which a month
later will be running but feebly, are still
bright and sparkling. The cattails, in the
bogey places, are just beginning to turn.
The manzanita and madrona have donned
their brilliant coats of deep-red bark. The
tender greens of the new-growth redwood
are deepening into mature, dark loveli
ness, and the woodsy places are thick with
huckleberries and the blackberries for
which our Californian woods are famous.
You may believe, with Thoreau, that no
one ever succeeded in getting a huckle
berry into town, but if you go for huckle
berries you are likely to get something
tetter yet.
There are a number of elevations to
tempt the amateur tramper, but as a rule
at this time of year there is little to re
ward the climber that may not be ob
tained nearer and with less exertion. The
Mission Peak, Tamalpais, San Bruno,
Grizzly Peak and Redwood Summit are 1
royally worth climbing when the first
rains have cleared the air, but during the
hazy summer and early autumn months,
while the haze effects are wonderful and,
to one familiar with the hill views at all
seasons, perhaps lovelier than any others,
the occasional climber usually feels disap
pointed if, having reached an elevation
which he has been told commands a view
over a vast expanse of country, he finds
himself looking off into a beautiful but
impenetrable purple and golden haze.
The woman who would enjoy a com
fortable tramp and come home therefrom
comforted and refreshed should be dressed
therefor. Toothpick shoes, tight waists
and long skirts have no place in the
tramper's outfit. A laced shoe is better
than one that buttons; low shoes, with
gaiters, are superior to either, provided
they have comfortable heels and toes and
a sole substantial enough to protect the
foot from bruising stones and rough trails.
Unless you are accustomed to a moder
ately thick sole, however, you will find
them fatiguing. If your feet are tender a
flexible insole in a shoe loose enough to
admit it is easier than a thick, stiff sole.
A good way to toughen tender feet is to
soak them at night in a warm, strong solu
tion of alum in water, and in the morning,
. before starting, to bathe them in cold
water in which is a little spirits of am
monia, about a teaspoonful to two quarts
of water. Dry your feet thoroughly before
dressing them.
Bloomers, a short skirt and a blouse
make the most comfortable walking suit.
Under the blouse should De worn a snugly
fitting but not tight waist. It adds ma
terially to comfort in grade-climbing. A
big hat is usually a nuisance, as, also, a
, walking-stick is apt to be. The latter,
moreover, unless you are essaying a stiffer
tramp than is usually to be had about San
Francisco, is a bit of an affectation. A
jacket should always be carried, but it and
any other impedimenta with which you
may be burdened sbould be carried upon
the shoulders. This is a rule you should
always observe if you wish really to benefit
by your tramps. Go evenly weighted and
as lightly as possible. Ten pounds on a
mile track may serve to defeat a good
horse, and one pound carried on the arm
or in the hand on a tramp may serve to
spoil what would otherwise be a glorious
trip.
Choose your companion on a tramp
carefully. One member of the party who
is unable to keep the pace is a sore trial to
strength and patience, for it is always
more fatiguing to lag than to go forward'
promptly. Of course you take a luncheon,
but if you are out for the benefit of your
health and the uplifting of your soul, re
member that luncheon is an incident, not
the event of your trip, and make it as sim
ple, as wholesome and as nourishing as
possible. Avoid taking a variety of things,
and if you take fruit be sure it is perfectly
ripe, and that there is not too much of it.
Nuts and raisins are better than fresh
fruit for such occasions, and each member
of the party should carry her own
luncheon. Never hurry, and, if you
are wise, you will avoid level
roads. They make the hardest sort
of walking, and do not, as a rule, lead
to the most interesting places. In hill
climbing most people will find it easier to
walk â¢* a pretty good e-ait. This may
I make you a little breathless at first, bu t
I you will get your "second wind" after a
bit, and the muscular fatigue is less than
in strolling along.
I have spoken of August as the month
for visiting canyons. There are a num
ber of interesting ones close about the
bay that are not too much frequented to
be pleasant. Sequoia Canyon, near Miil
Valley, is one of these. It is peculiarly
interesting for its sylvan growth, as it
presents several distinct "belts" of timber,
each representing a separate period.
Redwoods, sycamores, alders and ma
dronas are here, to be studied, and the
place is well worth a visit. The redwood
growth is particularly interesting, and
every Californian ought to be familiar
with the characteristics of this noble tree.
Yet I was asked recently by an almost
life-long resident of tbe State if the red
wood is a conifer.
One of the pleasantest and most profit
able tramps I know in this vicinity is over
the old "Jack Hays Canyon road," be
yond Blair's Park, across the bay. It is well
to make an early start for this, which is a
trip quite within the powers of a compara
tive novice in tramping. Take the electric
car at Washington and Broadway, in Oak
land, for Piedmont. Leave the car at the
park entrance, and take the first road to
the right thereof, keeping the park at your
left. You will find yourself at once trav
ersing very pretty country, now skirting
tempting angles of laurel and buckeye,
alder and oak, the tops of the tall trees
almost in reach of your hand, so deep is
the canyon. You can scramble down a
mile or so beyond your starting point, and
just at this season can "pick" your way
through a blackberry tangle where the
ripe fruit hangs thick and tempting, lunch
at the bottom, wfcere a tiny stream flows
through, and climb up the ether side, com
ing out through eucalyptus wood lots near
the old silk culture station.
Ihere is always something rather as
tonishing about the places you find your
self coming out at in that neighborhood.
A slight bend of the ravine, or round of
the hills, brings you to a point of view so
new you think you have come to terra in
cognita, when another turn brings you
close to some familiar landmark. If you
are a good walker and wish to go far
afield, you can leave the road by the first
turn to the left, beyond the little school
house, and tramp over the divide
into Contra Costa County, and on
to Walnut Creek, but you will re
turn by train. as it is/ a
stiff trip. In fact, this road is full of pos
sibilities. Ycu can*eep along it, and find
plenty to interest you, until you have
skirted the foothills and find yourself back
in Oakland, at Thirteenth avenue, ere you
know.it. Bht take advice, and strike into
the road to the left, just before you reach
the quarry, and follow it, keeping always
to the left, to where it winds through fields
of stubbie, past a cattle-ranch or two, on
to where, growing apparently out of solid
rock, a solitary redwood tree stands like a
sentinel, sole occupant of a great field.
The lone sentinel looks out over a very
wonderful sight, by the way, and you will
do well to sit down in its shade for
luncheon.
On the one hand, before you, the hills
tumble away, playing leap-frog over each
other's shoulders to where Diablo towers,
his great head just outlined above them
all, miles away. You will not see much in
the other direction, but hidden by the
haze lies the Golden Gate, and between
you and it are Oakland, the bay and San
Francisco. You will probably catch a
glimpse of the "Dead Man Laid" Out" on
Tamalpais, and register a vow toxcome
back here when the rains have
cleared the air, but when you have
eaten your luncheon, this time, you
will push on, free from care, for!
youVre on a road where none molest or j
make afraid, and descending by an easy i
grade into a delectable forest, where red- I
woods, madrona and laurel tower above a
tangle of manzanita, and ceanothis, cur
rant, witch hazel and azalea; where the!
yerba buena runs in and out along the j
paths, and where, everywhere, just at j
present, huckleberries are growing "thick
M bees." You wiil have to get permis- j
sion to pick these, if you are of the people
of sincerity and respect the rights of
others, but it is decent treatment and not
the earth that the landholders thereabouts
desire, and you will not find this difficult. }
You will be dusty and hungry when you j
reach home. Warm, too, in all probabil- j
ity, and this holds good of all occasions of
return from a long tramp. You will avoid
the plunge bath, warm or cold, for which
you tnink you are longing. Do not put
the feet in water. Sponge them off in
tepid water with a little ammonia added,
and you may take a quick tepid sponge
bath, taking care to expose but a small
part of tbe body at a time to the air.
Then a light supper and a long night's
rest, and ten to one if you are not, in the
best sense of that word, "a new woman"
in the morning. Penelope Powelson.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
CASCADE LAKEâ An Effect in Sunshine and Shadow; From a Photograph Taken for "The Call"
JKe JVlovmtairv Lakes of Galifomia
A LAND OF NATURAL WONDERS AND MARVELOUS BEAUTIES
Once upon a time some notable who j
spent a week upon the Pacific Coast re- ]
gretted "the sad fact that there were no
lakes in California." Another tonrist of
the same kind told us that we had no but
terflies, and a third bewailed in moving
phrases our total lack of singing birds.
That wa3 before we Californians h;id fairly |
begun to think for ourselves, and most of i
us, bowine to fame and authority, mar- j
mured that these things must be true; |
j but some, with reckless audacity, using I
j their own eyes, saw that we had butter
i flies and mountain lakes, and, using their
own ear?, heard the singing of our larks
and orioles. After a little, when the
| new and golden age of summer outings
began to dawn upon Californians, we dis- |
covered that our lakes were not surpassed i
by those of any other mountain region of j
the United States. The hasty generalizer |
was wrong, as he generally ia.
State maps show little of the Sierra lake
system. The sheets cf the admirable geo- 1
logical survey and those of the active, i
well-managed Sierra Ulub show many !
mountain lakes as yet unnamed, and still !
fail to show some that are known to fisher- j
men and hunters.
Many of these small mountain lakes j
will some time become the pride and de
light of persons of culture and refinement.
They will be stocked with fish, if not al- 1
ready so, and will be under private owner- j
ship or will become noted public resorts, j
The late Professor John Le Conte says I
somewhere: "Hundreds of little Alpine '
"YOU ARE ON A ROAD WHERE NONE MOLEST OR MAKE AFRAID"
lakes, with their clear, deep, cold, emerald
waters, are embosomed among the crags
of the Sierra Nevada Mountains." He de
scribes many of them and the processes by
which they were formed among the pine
crested ridges of granite that rise to such
giants as Shasta, Lassen, Lyall and Whit
ney. From the summit of Lyall a party
of university students not long ago counted
thirty-nine lakes in plain sight.
A large number of very attractive moun
tain lakes are scattered about in the
central Sierra region, around the forks of
the Yuba and American to the Summit
and beyond. Many of these have as yet
no name, though well worth mapping.
Every year new trails are laid out, and
these wild places are. made more acces
sible. Lake Fenner, Lake Eleanor, Lake
Angeline, Five Lake Valley, Lake Pleas
ant, Eureka, English, Stirling, Meadow
and many others will long be remembered
by those who visit them. It would be
easy to give a list of a hundred such, all
charming and well worth an extended
description.
But the finest lake region of the Sierras
is along the line of that glacier-hewn
Alpine valley, the Truckee basin, between
the east and west divisions of tbe vast
mountain rangeâ in that immense cleft
extending almost north and south, wherein
are Webber, Independence, Dormer and a
score of lesser lakes, in which wild tor
rents flow, not oceanward, but inland,
toward the desert, and in which, greatest
of all, our sealike Tahoe reposes among
its purple crags and transcendent peairs
of snow, our pre-eminent Californian lake,
that certainly ranks among the three or
four finest mountain lakes of America,
and is as well worth one's admiration as
Lucerne or Geneva. *
Figures do not tell much, but sometimes
they help. Our Tahoe covers an area of
nearly 200 square miles. Its greatest
length is twenty-five miles, and its great
est width is twelve miles, while its great
est depth is about a quarter of a mile, arid
its surface is more than a mile above the i
ocean. In round numbers then, the eleva
tion of Tahoe is o/er 6200 feet, while that
of Lake Geneva is only 1150, and its ereat
est depths over 1700 feet, while that of
Geneva, near Evian, is 920 feet. While
crescent-shaped Geneva is fifty miles long
its greatest width is but eight miles. It
has Mount Blanc, to be sure, but Tahoe
has snowy Tallac, nearly 10,000 feet high,
from whose sides a score of mountain
lakes can be seen in the wild Sierra can
yons. True, Geneva has its famous castles !
and ancient towns; the historical charm '
and glamour brood over its lovely waters; j
on one side is ~Savoy, on the other the
beautiful Pays de Vaud; there flows the
arrowy Rhone. And yet our own Tahoe,
with its literary and historical charms
only beginning to be created, appeals j
forcibly to every healthy, imagination by j
reason of this very fact.
On one side of gray Nevada, the silver
and sagebrush commonwealth; on the
other is the main axis of the Sierras and
eolden California. Here, in ail its un
spoiled freshness, is a vast mountain
amphitheater, wherein human interests
must increasingly gather for many genera-
tions to come. Arrow-like Truckee,
speeding down the glacier-hewn canyon
from Tahoe past Reno, oifers as many
bold promontories for summer castles as
does the Rhone. As for Tahoe itself the
time will come, after the great valleys are
full of people, when this magnificent
lake will be fairly girdled with towns,
cottages and stately mansions. Thousands
of city dwellers will come here, not only
for the fir-fragment summers, but for the
superb winters of our high alps; our St.
| Petersburg of ice palaces and slejgh bells
I will be on the shores of Tahoe and in the
nollows of Truckee.
Tahoe has had a sudden popularity this
I SR ason. Never before was its lines of trans
| Portation so severely tested. New and
larger hotels, more cottages and better ac
commodations are foreshadowed. Perhaps
in a few years Truckee will have a branch
railroad to the lnke. It is probable that a
large part of tins great increase of travel
is due to the energy which built the new
steamer Tahoe. one of tbe swiftest and
most exquisitely proportioned pleasure
orafts in America and a great credit to the
Union Iron Works. This vessel, with a
length of 168 feet, extreme breadth of less
than 18 feet, displacement of 152 tons,
horsepower of 1500 and speed of 25 or 26
miles per hour, is licensed to carry 200
passengers. She makes daily to ips around
the lake, and with her powerful search
lights is especially adapted to night ex
cursions. The thoroughly organized stage
coach system by which connections are
made with Truckee deserves high praise.
The tollroad is excellently kept, and no
where else in California can a more attrac
tive fifteen-mile stage ride be foundâ past
giant rock pinnacles, straneely shaped
by prehistoric ice rivers. The pioneers
have named many of the stone
faces that overlook the canyons â
Roscoe Conkling, ShaKespeare, Belva
Lockwood and half a score of
others. One sees aho the "Devil's Black
smith-shop," with a huge anvil of perfect
shape left in the rock; the "Devil's Play
ground, " a magnificent moraine, and the
"Devil's Oven," besides many other freaks
of nature. â¢ ,
Ordinary guidebook publications give
surface details about Tahoe. They tell one
about the stage-route terminus at Tahoe
City â not so picturesque a place as some
others, but still very interesting and evi
dently a popular resort; they describe to
some extern t the private villas, such as
Sunnyside and ldlewild; the public re
sorts, as McKinney's, Rubicon Springs,
Emerald Bay, Tallac, Yanks, Bijou,
GlenbrooK and others. All of these are
mere beginnings, extremely creditable, to
be 3ure, but little indeed to what they will
be in a few years more under wise and
businesslike encouragement of the travel
ing public of California and Nevada, not
to include the rest of the Pacific Coast and
the Eastern tourists. Every Christian
Endeavorer coming to California in 1897,
for instance, will jee Tahoe if given half a
chance.
The general impression one gets from a
trip around the Tahoe resorts is that of
comfort, heaithfulness aud variety.
People can have style and fashion or they
can live plainly and comfortably in tents
or cottages in go-as-you-please colonies.
There is room and to spare for every
grade of expenditure and for every class
of tourist.
The territory accessible from Tahoe is in
deed most attractive, and every year more
people explore it. The other day 1 heard
John H. Budd of Stockton, regent of the
university and brother of our worthy Gov
ernor, remark that he was going on a fish
ing trip in "Faith, Hope and Charity."
"That is a charming spirit in which to
start," said the person to whom the re
mark was addressed. "The leading ques
tion, however, is whether it will be prac
ticable for one to come back in the same
frame of mind."
Faith, Hope and Charity, be it under
stood, are three small valleys of Alpine
Counvy, The late Ross Browne,\when he
made that notable journey of his on foot
across the Sierras on the "rush to Washoa"
in 1860, happened into Hope Valley la a
snowstorm. Worn out and hungry he
hobbled up to the only cabin it contained
and asked a big, burly mountaineer who
sat on a pile of foxskins by the doorway if
he could stay there all night.
The mountaineer, holding a Jarge white
bulldog by the ears, replied with visible
emphasis:
"Bull an' me thinks you'd better light
out and go twelve miles further!"
This point of view was steadily main
tained, and poor Ross Browne trudged
hopelessly out of Hope Valley. His only
satisfaction was in labeling the moun
taineer as Diogenes when he published
the story. Charles H." Shinn.
Baird or\ Athletics
I take it that it is as much the duty of
an adviser to warn as to encourage. A
friend is as much a friend when he re
proaches as when he applauds. Pope says:
Trust not yourselves: but your defects to know,
Make use of every friendâ and every foe.
Therefore I wish to lay aside the theme
of encouragement, and from the exper
ience of a generation dwell upon the theme
of caution.
Caution is greatly needed in athletics,
and for two reasons: First, because the
sport is more or less interesting and ex
citing, enticing a person to excess. Sec
ond, because the votaries are generally
young, and often do not know better than
to go to extremes.
For instance I have a young friend who
is very fond of swimming. He is not sat
isfied with going in for Uventy minutes or
half an hour, but he must stay in for
hours at a time. Two or three times be
has bad the cramps, and was glad to find
himself on shore. At other times he finds
himself weak and not fit for much the
next morning. Yet he does not take
these lessons to heart, and is likely sooner
or later to suffer for his thoughtlessness.
Therefore excitement and inexperience
are likely to cause trouble if the young
athlete is not cautious.
I cannot too strongly advise young and
aspirine athletes about smokingâparticu
larly cigarette smoking. Whatever may
be said about the harmlessness of full
grown men smoking it is generally agreed
that it is a terrible injury to boys.
I cannot quote a better authority than to
state that tbe United States Military Acad
emy at West Point will not admit a boy
who has been accustomed to smoke. Ten
years ago I visited that wonderful institu
tion that produced the Grants, the Sher
mans, the Sheridans and the Hancocks of
the war, and it was not difficult to see the
effect of the prohibition of tobacco.
Such a line-looking lot of young men it
would be almost impossible to find, exoept
by actually picking them from our gymna
siums and athletic clubs. The color on
their cheeks, the elastic step and the
manly though not pompous bearing did
not all come from instruction and disci
p line, but from freedom irom the effects o
tobacco and liquor as well.
Let me assert most positively that wine,
Deer, or liquor of any kind are unneces
sary to an athlete's success, and are used
for the sole purpose of tictling the palate
and bracing the nerves. I commenced ex
ercising eighteen years ago, and have
never drank a glass of liquor in any form
in my life. As to whether I have been
successful, I will refer the reader else
where. Among the good results of total
abstinence, I will state that I have never
I missed a day from business in eighteen
yearsâ no, not a half a day, through sick
ness. As for alcohol or any other lini
ment after exercising, let me say that I do
not believe in it. As a special thing it is
all right in its way, to ward off a cold, or
after a long and severe race, or something
special of that kind ; but to make
a practice of rubbing liniment of
any kind in the skin is wrong.
If a person believes in taking whisky for
a cold and Keeps on using it until it be
comes a habit, of what use will it be for a
cold? The system has become used to it.
The same law applies with liniment. The
skin gets accustomed to it and the alcohol
becomes ineffective. A friend recently
said that liniment took all the stiffness
out of the muscles after exercising. My
reply was that there must be something
the matter with the exercise if it required
something to brace his muscles up. Only
a rare and special effort sbould make such
a stimulant necessary. Exercise, as a reg
ular thing, should never be indulged in to
such an extent as to leave the joints and
muscles stiff. Take my advice and use al
cohol externally but once a week, and in
ternally, never!
Walking, as a style of racing, has many
objections, irirst, it is not practical. It
is a fine exercise, I admit, but that is not
everything. Twenty years ago if a man
wanted to cover fifty miles he would walk
âto-day he would go on a doe trot, and
get there a long way before his walking
companion. I repeat, it is not practical
except as a mere exercise.
Secondâ As there are very few men who
are capable of judging a walk, it places
the competitors very often in the hands of
incompetent men. Sometimes good men
are appointed to serve, but something
interferes and the men are at the mercy of
a well-meaning, perhaps, but inexperi
enced judge of walking. The rules of
athletics say that the decision of the judge
shall be final and without appeal; but
this rule, wise as it is (for it shuts off end
less controversy), actually places a walker
in the power of a prejudiced or unprinci
pled official.
Thirdâ An honest walker cannot tell
when he is "lifting," so that when he is
disqualified He feels very bitter against the
judge. He tries to walk fairly, but if his
style is defective he does not know it. If
you hear a man stoutly assert that he was
walking perfectly fair don't pay any at
tention to him ; or if bis friends say the
same remember that "love is blind," and
in this case possibly ignorant. The eyii

to Style
lÂ°f this matter is that cases have been
â known where men who have been consid-
Hdered the patterns of excellence in style
â have begun to skip without a moment's
â warning, to the astonishment of their in
â timate friends. The worst of f t whoia
â  matter is that few walkers have escaped
â  censure, however just or unjust it may be.
â  i have seen some men go oat and walk
â  perfectly fair and be pronounced skippers
â by the prejudiced and the ignorant. On
â  the contrary, I have seen men win cham
â  pionships and beat records whose walking
â  was certainly not fair.
â  An athlete goes out to run. The race
â  begins, and from the crack of his pistol
â he has only to think of keeping his own
â  course and putting out the best there is
â in him. A walker is different. He must
â  not only think of judgment and speed,
â  but he must regard that man walking
â  around the middle of the field who is
â  watching him so narrowly; he must re
â  gard those reporters, who may "rip him
â up the back" to-morrow, and he must
â  have a wholesome regard for the crowd
â  who line the outer rail ready to cheer for
â  him or howl at his style according as they
â  happen to belong to his club or his rival's.
â  Throughout my whole athletic career I
â  have seen so much quarreling between
walkers themselves, accusing each other
of bad style; so much resentment at
judges, accused of unfair decisions and
prejudice; so much controversy among
friends of competitors and spectators, and
so much discussion in the newspapers over
the manner of walking of the favorites of
the public, that for many years I have
never lost an opportunity to say to begin
ners, Do not go into walking; ana to those
who have already begun, Drop walking
and go into distance running.
I have known an old walker, whose
name is familiar to every student of
records and athletic statistics. Â»I have
seen him go out and win championships
and beat records, yet it was difficult to get
two experts to agree upon his style. I
have heard an old athlete say that his
walking was perfectly fairâ beautiful, and
heard another say that it should not have
I been allowed. He is the holder to-day
of many besU on record, yet there are two
elements in the Eastâ one that accepts his
records unqualifiedly, the other refuses to
accept them at all, or with considerable
hesitation. â 
I could mention the name of another
man who won more than one champion
ship, and carried the scalps of many a
champion on his belt. No one ever
questioned the good intention of this man,
yet after he had won his first champion
ship he was continually in hot water on
account of his style, which without his
consent insisted on giving him trouble.
He labored for years to correct the diffi
culty, which neither he nor physicians or
trainers could understand; and though
winning another championship by the
greatest labor and care to keep his style in
form, went to pieces immediately after.
He was finally compelled to give up walk
ine as his style refused be corrected.
Cases have been known where men have
become amateur pedestrians, have put in
a great deal of time on heel and toe, have
spent years at it with more or less suc
cess, until they have awakened to the con
clusion that it was impossible to overcome
the criticism that was incessantly aimed
at them. Then they have decided to enter
the running field, but discovered that
their system had become too much set to
ever make a success at it. Had they gone
into running instead they would undoubt
edly have made a success, as a good walker
makes a fine distance runner if he does not
put it off too long.
There are other reason* why walking
races are a nuisance. For instance, here
is a boy who enters his name for a race.
He is perfectly honeÃt; would scorn to
win a race by unfair means, and more
over is a hard ana conscientious trainer.
On the day of the race his family all turn
out, and with his best girl along go to see
the young man win. Fancy their rage,
indignation and resentment when they
see the pride of the family ignominously
and unceremoniously ordered off the track
for unfair walking. Would it not be natu
ral for him to prefer to leave town than
face his family, and particularly her? But
tne ignominy does not end here, for the
next day the papers may say, after men
tioning his name, "Ruled off for skip
ping."
There is another point not to be orer
looked In this argumentâ the public. I
have seen the public assemble in large
numbers to see a race between great
walkers, and when the contest was getting
most interesting one of the competitors
would be disqualified; the one that waÂ»
leftâ the winnerâ would drop his hands
and finish slowly. Now it is not fair to
treat a good-natured public in this man
ner, and the only way to cure ft is to let
heel-and-toe walking fall into disuse.
One of the greatest objections to walk
ing is the constant dispute over the
records. No one *who knows anything
about walking at all believes the records
as they stand on the books in favor of pro
fessionals in England, which are the best
in the world. I was intimately acquainted
with the gentleman who judged a walk in
which J. W. Raby apoeared in thi3 coun
try. He is the holder of tbe records
just spoken of, from two to seven
miles, made in England. He told
me if Raby walked that way
in the old country it was no wonder that
he took down all the records from off their
pegs. In fact it was not walking at all.
There are many people to-day who will
not believe the present amateur records of
this country as a wiiole. They insist that
some are cloudy. England has to-day a
very fast amateur mile record, made over
ten years ago. Now, I had the pleasure of
having this man in a race with me, and
all I have to say is that if I bad been per
mitted to go in the style tnat was permit
ted to him on that occasion I would have
taken a sponge and altered every time on
the table of records for walking.

THE DONALD STORY
I haven't told the tiny boys a story all
for their "loney selves" for a long, long
time, so I am going to tell them one to-day.
Not many weeks ago little black-eyed
Georgte and blue-eyed Donald spent a
whole day together.
They had not seen each other for six
months, and that's most as long as six
years to tiny boys, isn't it? Now this is
how it came about:
One day as Donald's mamma was walk- |
sng along Market street, whom should she (
chance to meet but Georgie's mamma,
and thesÃ two arranged for the visit right
there. The day was set, and Donald's ;
mamma told Georgie's mamma that she
would send Borne one for Georgie early in
'the morning, and would see that he got
safely home in the evening.
There were two very happy tiny boys in
this big City that night when the sweet news
was whispered into their little pink ears.
At last the day came, and Donald's big i
brother -went for Georgie. He found the
little boy impatiently waiting, so they re
turned on the very next car.
Donald was standing by the corner, near
his home, watching for them, and when
they arrived he cried: "Hello, Georgie, I I
am awfully glad to see you! Won't we |
have a jolly time!' 1
"Yes," said Georgie, sliDping his brown ,
hand into Donald's with a happy little j
sigh; "I'm gJad as I can be. Bee, I've ;
got lots of buckins on dese clothes."
"Yes; I see. Let's go right to mamma ]
first, and then we'll play, Georgie."
Up the long flight of stairs climbed the j
four sturdy feet, and then they marched
straight to mamma's room.
"Oh, what a beautiful boy!" she ex
claimed. "Just see his pretty velvet suit
and his clean white blouse, all trimmed
with lace ! Such a lovely blue necktie, and
a sailor cap, too!"
"Yes; my ru udder buyed 'em for me
long time ago," lisped the child, so proud ',
and important that he could hardly speak. !
Having admired him to his heart's con
tent, and even enough to satisfy sweet, ,
loving Donald, she sent the happy pair off |
to play. And such a play as they had.
First they went to visit all the pets. .
Doggie "Rags," of course, was an old
friend, and he seemed to know Georgie
right away, for Le jumped on the little
boy and licked his hands and face so hard
that Georgie had to hide behind Donald to
get away fiom him, crying, "Oh, he kithes
me too wet!"
Then Goldie, the canary, was intro
duced, and brother's silver and gold fish
and the funny little kitten with a coat as
black as Georgie's eyes.
Ob, yes; there was the snail, too. Bat, j
poor thing, when they opened its box they j
found it dead. Donald felt so sorry, and
I'm afraid he felt guilty, too, because he
had forgotten to give it a fresh leaf tbe I
day before.
I have never told you how he got that |
pet snail, have I? Well, I shall some day i
pretty soon.
After the pets had ail been seen tbe
boys took tho coaster and had such a
merry time riding down hill so fast that it
almost took away their breath.
Then Jhey flayed Mamma and Papa.
Xa(V/; FooA.
Paid my blue-eyed cousin John,
" What do fairies live upon?"
And he looked in eager wise
At me with his bright young eyes.
"Every morning-time," I said,
"They bake tiny loaves of bread;
Cricket-steaks they often eat;
And their drink is honey sweet.
From the honeysuckle bell, â¢
Or the crimson clover cell;
They have berry pie and tart
Flavored with a rose's heart;
And a very favorite thing
Is a slice of beetles' wing."
"Pooh!" cried John, "no wonder that
Fairies are rot big or fat!"
Clinton Scollard in Wide Awake.
wurrd to say. But let me casht me oy
inter a windy where there's chape chairs
an' tables 'an' other furnitoor marked
'quartered oak,' an' the owld sbtory ay the
apple cut inter four paces that was larnt
me as a by cooms roight back to me.
"There's four quartbers to ivery blissed
thin' in this wurrld, Dennis, me son, and
whin a table is 'quarthered oak,' accoord
in'to the man that sells it, be the same
token you may know it's three-quartners
poine.-aven if he makes no mintion ay
it."â Youth's Companion.
A little boy's elder sister is much inter
ested in photography and gives the family
the benefit of many observations about
her work. The little boy was taken to the
courthouse to see the end of a certain
trial. He came home and told his mother
about it. "The Judge made a speech to
the jury," he said, "and then sent them
off to a dark room to develop."
FOR TINY BOYS.
Then they played with the little grocery
store and kept Paddy Murphy, the grocer,
very busy weighing out and wrapping up
chocolate and sugar.
Poor fellow! it was pretty hard on him.
He isn't very strong, you know; not since
the day his brother dropped him, acci
dentally, of course, out of the window,
and he broke in two.
Mamma glued him together again, so you
never could tell the difference, but he acts
quite tired sometimes.
Thus they tried one play after another.
First indoors and then out Now asking
for bread, butter and sugar, and then for
a drink of water.
Merry, happy little urchins!
Last of all they played house.
Gfcor?ie said: "You get me one of your
muvers dresses and I'll be the mamma."
"AH right; and I'll be the papa," said
Donald, as he put on one of brother's suits.
Didn't they look cute, though! I just
wi3h you could have seen them. Dolly
uimple saw a little too much of them, I
think, for they made and unmade her bed !
so many times, and dressed and undressed
Miss Dolly herself so often, that she almost
had another spasm .
The day came to a close all too soon, as j
such days always do. Loving good-bys
were said and then tbe two faithful little
friends separated once more, but I hope
not for six months, don't you?

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
MOTHER GOOSE GIVES AN ENGERCANMENG
By inviting Mother Goose to be present
bright boys and girls may enjoy a most
delightful evening's entertainment. The
diversion Is not at all difficult, and a pair
of spectacles, a cap and a powdered wig
will make a Mother Goose out of one of
the older girls.
Provide each one of the company with a
lead pencil, a slip of paper headed "A
Pennny for Your Thoughts," and bearing
numbers from one to twenty. After ex
plaining that the rest of the programme
will be carried out by a very dear friend.,
introduce Mother Goose.
"My dear friends," says Mother Goose,
"upon receiving the invitation to enter
tain you this afternoon the honor seemed
so great I have ventured to bring with me
a few friends who have kindly volunteered
their services. Being rather curious to
know whether you will recognize them
readily I will request you to write their
names on your papers as I introduce
them. The first one is a dear boy of
whom I am extremely fond."
Then Mother Goose takes from her bas
ket a jack such as children play with, a
stalk of any kind and a bean. She places
them on the table before her and says:
"Here he is. Look sharp now and tell
me his name."
At the end of a few minutes she replaces
them in her basket.
For No. 2 Mother Goose arranges on the
table three cards, on the first of which a

Sharks furnish quite a number of valua

tains an oil of a beautiful color that never
becomes turbid and that possesses medi

oil. The skin, after being dried, takes the
polish and hardness of mother-of-pearl.
The tins are always highly prized by the
Chinese, who pickle them and serve them
at dinner as a most delicate dish. The
Europeans, who do not yet appreciate the
fins of a shark as a food product, are con
tent to convert them to fish glue, which
competes with the sturgeon glue prepared
in Russia. As for the flesh of the shark

with the bones in the preparation of a fer

THE LILY AND THE ROSE.
A beautiful lily, one eve in June,
Danced with a rose
By the light of the moon.
Said the rose to the lily:
"It's time for us to rest,
For every little tired bird
Is nestling in its nest."
Before the break of morn
The fairies around did stray,
And took the little rose
To fairyland away.
In the morning the rose was gone;
The beautiful lily sighed
She lain her head upon the grass
And in her sorrow died.
In fairyland the rose was sad.
Inquired all around
For a beautiful tall fair lily
That she never found.
"O you wicked little thing,"
She said to a little sprite,
"You took me away from my comrade
That dancea in the beautiful moonlight.
Do you think I'm happy,
When not a flower I know?
O, take me back to the lily
Or I'll die in want and woe."
She turned around, in the pretty vase
A lily she did see.
She said like a voice of a fairy queen,
"Are you the Illy that dwelt with me?'
The lily answered with a sigh,
Her words were very slow,
"Oh, that lily that you dwelt with
Is withered long ago."

PHIA TIME*.
It is a very warm afternoon. The sun
comes straight down on Aunt Maria's
old-fashioned garden, and the columbines
and brides- and-groorns are nodding their
heads as if they did not enjoy it; only the
scarlet lychnis stands up straight and
bold. The heat has caused the petals of
the yellow roses to fall and the jfround be
neath the bushes looks as if fairies had
been strewing it with gold pieces.
Not a leaf rustles in the great orchard.
Animal and bird sounds are hushed, ex
cept for the sharp buzzing of a humming
bird in the vines over the veranda where
father. Aunt Maria and I are sitting.
Father is reading, Aunt Maria's needle*
are clicking steadily, and I am bolstered
in the hammock with pencil, paper and
book for amusement. Father and aunt
keep asking if I am tired and warn me not
to write too much. It seems strange, my
being petted and fussed over, but I like it,
and the fortnight I have spent in bed has
not been doleful; they have all been so
kind to me, especially father, with whom
I am now getting to be really acquainted.
Of course, I was to blame, and it was my
disobedience that caused all the trouble
and anxiety, but Aunt Maria says there
were extenuating circumstances (whatever
that means) and Uncle John says he
guesses I'll "keep away from the back
pasture in future." But I had better tell
the whole story.
Father and I live in New York. Mother
died when I was a very little boy, and
father, being busy in his office all day, at
night was too tired to bother with me. So
I was sent to Mr. Brown's school at Maple
wood, where I stayed all the time, not
going home in holidays as tbe other pupils
did. Father sent me lots of pocket money,
but that didn't make up for the long,
lonely summers, and to add to my unhap
pinesss, I was always getting into trouble
with Mr. Blown for breaking bounds, and
wandering off to the woods.
One day last June, we boys were loiter
ing by the schoolroom door, waiting for
prayer bell to ring. All were comparing
notes and making plans for tbo summer
holidays,, except me. How lonely and
wretched I felt, standing under Mr.
Brown's study window, kicking my toes
against the curbing.
Presently the window opened and Mr.
Brown's head was thrust out. I expected
a reprimand for tbe irritating noise I had
been making, but the head was instantly
withdrawn, the window banged and a let
ter came fluttering to my feet. It was ad
dressed to me and the postmark was New
York, but it was not in father's writing
and I was almost afraid to read it. It was
from a New York doctor saying that father
had been very ill, but was better, and
when able to travel, would take me with
him to spend the summer at his boyhood's
home iv Nova Scotia. All the world
seemed changed after reading that letter,
and I forgot that I had ever felt lonely or
neglected.
Father came the day school closed, and
after two days' delightful travel we arrived
at Uncle John's farm on Gobeciuid Bay.
Uncle John and Aunt Maria's boys were
grown up ana away, excepting Mac, who
helped uncle manage the farm.
Mac let me ride on the great loads of
hay, help guide tbe mowing and raking
machines, and sometimes he let me drive
the horses. What jolly times I had!
Only two places on the farm were for
bidden ground; one was the beach when
the tide was running in, the other tbe
back pasture, where Uncle John kept a
Jersey bull which had been showing signs
of becoming very vicious.
The pasture was more than a mile from
the house and was inciosed on three sides
by a high pole fence. The boundary on
the fourth skV# waa the bay. The cliffs,
which were from forty to fifty feet in
height, dropped perpendicularly to the
beach and could be climbed only in places
where a little brook bad gullied, or trees
i falling over had carried earth with them.
Day after day I watched the tide roar
ing and surging in and saw it go rolling
out as rapidly, and day after day I tnought
of tbe shallow pools out on the flats, with
the imprisoned shad swimming round
waiting to be caught.
One sultry afternoon I had gone to tbe
! marsh with the haymakers. It was low
j water, and a heavy cloud hung over tbe
bay. The broad expanse of sand looked
damp and cool, and although I had been
forbidden I thoneht it would not matter
much if I went out just a little way on the
flat. Mac and the men were hurrying to
get the hay up before the threatening
shower, and did not notice me as I went
through the long grass toward the bay.
I crossed the dyke, and taking off my
shoes and stockings, put them in a secure
place, and in five minutes more was out
of sight of the hayneld, with the vast ex
panse of sand and shining mud before me.

DAINTY GOWNS FOR THE DECLINING DAYS OF THE SUMMER SEASON
Some of tr^e Exquisite Costumes Worn by the Fashionables of Paris, London and .New York,, Jllso Some Good Reasons
Why the French Women Dress So Well and With Such Cood Taste on
Such Small Jlllowanees.
One reason French women manage to
dress well on comparatively small allow
ances when necessary is because they
never ru3h to extremes. A Parisian is
almost invariably graceful, never eccen
tric, and liKe her American, sister, is won
derfnlly captivating. Do yon remember a
pretty story told by Leon Tozlan of the
manner in which the Parisienne became
possessed of the treasures that render her
so charming? The good Fairy Blue called
together a maiden from every couutry, and
disiributed to each a gift she had brought
with her in her fairy bag. To the Spanish
maiden she gave long black hair, to the
Italian beautiful eyes, to the English girl
a complexion of milk and roses, to the
Austrian teeth of pearls, to the Russian a
distinguished mien, to the German senti
ment. Then she gave to the Neopolitan her
happy temperament, to the Irish girl her
wit, and to the maiden from Flanders her
good sense. Bui as she rose to depart the
Parisienne cried, "You have forgotten
me!" The good fairy answered: "Did I
forget you? 1 have nothing more to give.
You must asK a small share of all I have
given to the others." Then all the maid
ens drew near the Parisienne, and each
gave her something of what they had re
ceived: one, a lock of her hair; another, a
ray of her happy disposition; another, a
rose from her complexion; and thus she
who had been overlooked became the most
favored of them all.
Having acquired these pKcious gifts, it
is not surprising that she should at all
times have done her utmost to keep them.
From the world-famed Ninon de Lenclos
to the mondaine of to-day, it has always
be^n the aim of Parisiennes to appear
fresh and young, and it must be acknowl
edged that they have succeeded. Women
of 40 look like girls of 20, but how fre
quently has this same remark been made
concerning the women of California; how
ever, few of them devote the time and at
tention that the fair Parisians do to each
and every detail in connection with their
wardrobes.
Skirts are lighter than ever. Sleeves
are tight-fitting, with the- exception of
a slight fullness at the upper part
of the arm near the shoulder, which, as I
have said, will entirely disappear as
autumn advances.
All hats are being trimmed low and the
favorite style of hat is readily copied, as it
consists of a Manilla straw with a flat
brim and a wide ribbon in some bright
Jhe Lady From Borneo orv a Shopping Tour ir\ Sar\ Francisco
"Oh, yes," frankly admitted the lady
from Borneo, as we made preparations
to continue our social studies in San Fran
cisco. "On, yes, certainly, there is such
a person as a wild man in Borneo."
This was said simply, honestly, without
attempt at justification or insinuation in
self-defense thai there may be at Kast one
wild man also in San Francisco. No, in
deed, the Borneoese lady did not find it
incumbent upon her, me rely because her
people, figuratively speaking, reside in a
social jjlas-s-house, to throw a pebble at
our large local conservatory. Truth, un
blushing and without apology, is always
majestic. This child of nature, this lady
from Borneo, was as little likely 10 justify
any shortcomings in the social practices
of her native land by animadversion con
cerning another land as she was to lay
claim that the peak of Kinibaloo with its
elevation of 11,000 feet above the Bano
jarmassin peninsula is the peer of Mount
Shasta when all its skyward area of snow
takes on the pink magnificence of an "Al
pine glow." No; I suspect that the "re.
tort courteous" is not Borneoese.
I had invited the lady from Borneo to
go "window-shopping." She bad accepted
the invitation. A brief conversation bad
occurred in her apartments and that
which seems to me to have been the most
characteristic part of her utterances I have
quoted. Of course, I had selected the
afternoon for this tour. I am proud of
the afternoon display of finery and per
sonal beauty which Ban Francisco makes
in the shopping quarter and naturally de
sired the Borneoese lady to witness the
pageant at its best. The lady from Bor
neo had no desire to "show off," to use a
barbaric phrase, but I will confess that I
knew that we have a good thing of it
here in San Francisco and. 1 did not care
if she found it out. A personal vanity
may be unpardonable, but that vanity
which eonslats in inward gratulation at
color; flowered ones are seen, bnt the
plain are preferred. These ribbons are all
bordered at both edges with a roll of black
velvet and are made into a double box
pleat, and placed upon the hat so that half
the pleating stands around the crown and
the remainder lies upon the brim. It is
finished at the side with two ears of the
ribbon en aigrette.
There is quite a fad for Irish band
woven linens, as they make pretty skirts
and coats and are to be had in every con
ceivable tone and color. The Ellen Terry
linens are also liked, as they are obtain
able in many mixtures, such as violet and
green, pink and blue, mauve and white,
and in numerous other combinations
much liked by young schoolgirls, as with
the heavy fancy laces and embroideries
delightfully pretty frocks can be evolved.
Ellen Terry was one of the first to give
large orders for these linens, hence the
name. They make extremely stylish
dresses for matrons as well as for the little
maids. Gowns of white alpaca are still
to be seen, and one very recently de
signed bad a bodice made with a garni
ture of embroidered and sequin encrusted
grass lawn, slashel at the back and sides
in lines that would be becoming to most
figures, and had an under bodice of white
accordion pleated chiffon; the sleeves
were of white chiffon tucked, with a bell
puff of the same. At the throat and waist
were bands of gold. Another dress of the
same fabric had its bodice composed en
tirely of tucks set in long perpendicular
lines, with bretelles of ecru open-work em
broidery across the shoulders; two tucks
ran around the bottom of the skirt. A
sash of lime-green taffeta ribbon encircled
the waist, and the lining was of the same,
making it an expensive and dainty iobe.
Lately a young matron with blue eyes
and fair hair looked like a picture in a
gown of "flower-bjue" canvas which
fitted her to perfection. It had a bolero
bodice, which opened over a vest of grass
lawn embroidered in pale green and prim
rose. Her hat of Holland colored straw
was trimmed with cornflowers and green
tulle.
A dark-eyed beauty wore on the same
occasion an effective creation of loulard,
which had a brown ground covered with a
scroll-like design in white. It was made
with extreme simplicity, the bodice hav
ing a dainty vest and choker of creamy
white mousseline de soie and a deep
folded belt of white suede kid, which di
I the perfection of all your neighbors rises
almost to the height of patriotism, a vir
tue which I particularly admire.
The afternoon opened a little inauspi
ciously. That lam forced to confess. A
small personal weakness for the pictur
esque, a aim, very dim, appreciation of
the beauties of the- works of artists'
brushes and the graces of plastic art gen
erally, and also a well-concealed desire to
insinuate into my companion's, mind, deli
cately, the idea that we are esthetic â these
forces produced a disastrous resultant.
We went first to an art gallery which lay
invitingly open to us.
Diverse and sundry artists, with more or
less skill, have contributed to the picture
collection in this gallery impressionist or
other coun terfeit presentments of nature.
There were clusters of white roses so ex
quisitely beautiful on one canvas that they
would not have been shamed in the pres
ence of those roseate wonders which blos
somed, pathetically, during that brief
golden period for Mother Eve, then un
acquainted with sin, upon the emerald
slopes of the Garden of Eden. Oh, well,
there were lots of pictures, and my un
tutored laay from Borneo really looked at
them. Loosed until her eyes filled and
dilated.
"I am so glad we came "here," said a
smooth and well-modulated voice.
"Have a bonbon? [Invitation accepted.]
Yes, so am I. There was nothing to do in
my r6onig and so I came out."
"What doyou think of the pictures?"
"Oh, I don't care about the pictures at
all. I came here that I might kill time
and possibly see some one."
"Queerpeople come here."
"I should think so. What did you en
gage yourself about yesterday."
I went shopping a,nd had a lot of fun."
"What did you buy?"
"Buy? Nit."
Now, whether you will believe it or not,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUJJDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
CORRECT JiTTIRE FOR fiEHTLEJUEJi
rected attention to the wearer's slender,
graceful figure. The hat of coarse brown
straw was adorned with rosettes and a twist
of brown and white mousseline.
Croquet is being revived and promises to
again enjoy great popularity, and in some
respects the old-fashioned game has been
much altered and is now far more scien
tific; for instance, imagine the difficulty of
coaxing a ball to go through a loop which
is only just wide enough to permit of its
passing through. The success of this re
vival is a foregone conclusion, as we are
nothing if not scientific nowadays.
AFTERNOON FULL DRESS.
the choice bit of slang, "nit," saved me
from utter downfall. True the Borneoese
lady did not seem to have caught the idea
that we are very esthetic. She listened to
all that was said near us and could not
very well avoid taking in every word.
She did not smile. I could even detect a
modest doubt of her own pictorial judg
ment in her eyes.
She has not seen many pictures and she
1b willing to learn from us all about art.
Nit! Mysterious word. What did it mean?
Her lingual bewilderment made her the
more humble. How much she had to
learn in refinement to equal the ladies she
was meeting. While she was thinking
that way I coaxed her out before her
thoughts could revert to our volatile com
patriots who sought out an art gallery for
the purpose of killing time. I hope that
she will not recall that fatal statement.
While I was humiliated I learned a lesson
never, never to try to paint things any
better than they are before the Borneo
lady.
I wonder if any men will read about the
lady from Borneo? I wonder if any of
them are able to revel in contemplation of
a fancy neckwear departmentâ ladies', of
courseâ in a dry -goods store? Diaphanous
fabrics flutter like big or small butterflies
on lines. Pretty gentlemen â oh, yes, they
are pretty â with nice white bands and
courteous bows produce daily for a small
stipend enough politeness to stock Lord
Chesterfield. To such a place have the
lady from Borneo and myself come.
What thinks tne flamingo in its flaming
vest? How happy is the bird of paradise
in its â¢ opalescence? Think, my dear
yonng ladies, what agony of mind I saw
you manifest when the question of selec
tion of finery was thrust upon you!
Think how absurdly you could have com
bined colors to your own discomfiture!
Standing on one leg, stupidly staring into
vacancy, with a calm lagoon for a mirror,
The soft Horn burgs are but little worn
East, evidently being reserved for early
autumn, but of course here they are now
perfectly appropriate.
Trousers made out of gray and drab
cloths are being ordered by the smartest
men in New York.
Him is less conservative than usual in
his latest combinations, as he rather likes
the brown waistcoat he has seen with gilt
buttons. May we be delivered from such
horrible combinations. He says he rather
hopes that the report that yellow waist
coats are to be a fad is a fact, although he
does acknowledge that not all complex
ions or colorings combine well with it.
Scarlpins consisting of miniature golf or
polo balls are fashionable. The ball may
be simply of gold, or of a costly sapphire,
or emerald mounted in gold. Compara
tively few men show good taste in select
ing their pins.
The smartest of men wear but two but
tons in their evening shirts, which are of
the finest linen. With themstraieht stand
ing collars are worn. Many men have
given up having their shirts made witn
attached collars owing to trouble in hav
ing them properly laundried. However,
the cuffa are never made separate. In the
evening the shirt buttons should be of
pearl or white enamel. When pearls are
worn the link sleeve buttons are of plain
polished gold, lozenge shape, with mono
gram.
This season flannels striped and plain
and serges are worn for tennis, white
duck no longer being fashionable, as
trousers made of it never return from the
luandry in a satisfactory condition. Ten
nis trousers are cut wide and long. The
jacket has a whole back, with three pock
ets with flaps. A straw hat is worn.
The latest English yachting rig is of
blue serge. The coat is single-breasted,
after the cut of a reefer, made to fit rather
loosely. Three pockets. Length of gar
ment twenty-nine inches. Four buttons,
square cut. The double-breasted reefer is
worn by officers, rank being designated
by braid on sleeves.
Many golfing suits are being now made
out of brown Holland. They are much
liked, but golf club uniforms consist of
a coat composed of fine red cloth, with
the flamingo watches ita own image, and
behold! the complementary colors are in
its attire. Is it better to be a bird after
all? â¢
Perish that thought, which was only
thrown out to see whether it would invite
a masculine sneer. It would be tedious
beyond comparison to wear the same
dress always, even though the fit should
be superb and the blending and magnifi
cence of colors should be like an irides
cent dream. Even a molting period
would be welcome.
Here, where the convenient and well
burnished mirror stands convenient, let
the Borneoese lady see reflected as many
images as passed over that in which the
unfortunate "Lady of Shallott" pensively
gazed, while her melancholy song was
heard by the reapers "reaping early in
among the bearded barley." Girls come
in here who look as delicious as^a straw
berry ice and as fragile as the petals of a
tube rose, and they try on nearly every
necktie in the stock, not with the air of
martyrs, but with such keen zest of en
joyment that the clerks know that they
are shoppers and that they do not intend
to buy anything. Women as dignified
and undemonstrative as a Parsee ''tower
of silence" do not hesitate to take part in
this nuntâ the clerks being the hunted,
the lady being the hunter, and the neck
wear being of about the same utility of
paper clews in a "paper chase," they
merely point the way.
Next to a clear conscience give me a
hard heart. It has cost me some money
because I was unable to refuse to buy
something after the clerks had worked so
hard. Had I been thoroughly indurated
I would not have received that surprised
ani half-contemptuous look from a clerk
who detected my weakness.
The lady from Borneo caueht the look
also. "What does it all mean ?" ahe asked
later.
either the button or the insignia of the
club. The knickers are usually of tweed
or Scotch goods, but some clubs in Eng
land have them of white flannel, which
forms a picturesque contrast and. is far
more effective. Browns and greens are
going out, every one having wearied of
them. C. C.
Novelties ir\ Laces and LaWrxs.
A Newport correspondent says: "Laces
and lawns are at the zenith of their glory,
and what is there more charmingly femi
nine? There are incredible miles of Valen
ciennes edging, stretching, no doubt, with
FAWN-COLORED COVERT COAT
I told her frankly.
"But do not the ladies really expect to
buy when they cause so much trouble?"
"There are ladiesâ and ladies."
The Borneoese mind could not grasp
this. It bad expected to apprehend some
thing like a National custom, I think.
She had not learned how many ways we
have besides visiting the art galleries to
"kill time."
You see we did not confine ourselves to
window-shopping. We had plunged in
medias res, as Virgil says. We heard a
gray-haired shoe-dealer tell a lady who
stood impotent before the whims of a
child this wholesome truth:
"Madam, your child rules you already.
When he is 16 years old he will tread you
under his feet unless you master him."
I could not blame the dealer for talking
this way. Winrows of shoes of every
form and description surrounded the re
fractor; babe. The dealer had taken
down a sample of every kind of shoe he
had in the store, and had climbed as mary
rounds of a ladder up and down as would
have been needed to take him to the dizzy
top of the tower of Babel.
â¢'The children are all like aim," the
woman said meekly.
"Then, madam," broke in the brutal
voice of truth, "it is because the ladies are
like you."
Did that lady flounce out of the store ?
Didn't she? She went like a streak of
well-lubricated lightning.
I am tempted to tell you a fairy story.
Once tiiere was an enchanted land where
there dwelt a fairy who caused all people
to act in the spirit of unreason. In the
midst of the land arose to a dizzy height a
very steep mountain of glass. Around its
base grew vast meadows of flowers. At
the very top of the mountain there was re
puted to be one plant which produced a
flower of unusual brilliancy. There was
one beneficent fairy who assured people
ease to the moon â were we able to wend
our way there holding on to a bit and were
sure not an inch would be lost in addi
tion. What prettier fashion than this
bountiful use of it, and how welcome is
the revival! We shall mourn its day of
waning when it comes, but in the mean
j time do our best to win its constancy.
1 Time has proved that it can never vanish
nor be worsted by any rival, since beauty
is its steadfast ally.
"We could sing untiringly the praises of
muslin gowns of every variety, so prettily
are they made and so well is everybody
looking in them this season. One sees
such breezy effects in the forenoonâ the
muslin plisses and frills on bodice, curling
in and out of ribbons a-flying with the
wind, and skirt ripplings tossing ever so
gently to and fro. Does not this airy
motion lend an added grace to the least
attractive woman ?"
And a Parisian man writes: "The
aresses are exquisite, embroidered muslins
over apricot glace blanc, and the new tone
of green called 'pousse de lilas'; white
taffetas skirts, with small pink flouncings
placed one above the other, forming a full
ruche, worn with bodices of white crepe
de chine, printed with cornflowers and
grasses, on long- stalled La France roses,
and either black satin corselets or flowered
ribbon bands. These corselets are taxing
the inventive powers of onr big dress
makers, as every day discloses some nov
elty in the fastening of the bow or in the
texture of the material.
"The latest and most popular at Arme
nonville was in mousseline de soie, in black
or wbite, with a narrow pleating of pale
green all round it. It is made about four
yards long and a little over half a yard
wide, tied around the waist in a bow with
ends falling to the end oi the skirt; in the
front it is attached top and bottom with a
fancy pin to form a Swiss band. These
sasnes can also be made in any color with
the pleating to match, and look exceed
ingly pretty with white dresses."
Our American Duchess was greatly ad
mired at her Majesty's garden party given
on the 13th of last month. She wore a
most artistic combination of yellow and
pale blue, the under skirt being of an
exquisite shade of primrose satin, veiled
with white lisse, and this was trimmed
with several narrow bands of pale blue
satin.
The bodice was gracefully veiled with
lisse ana over the shoulders fell neither
that this blossom was neither more bril
liant nor more fragrant than others which
made up the fair embroidery of the
meadows.
One day a young lady climbed the
mountain, found the flower and tri
umphantly discovered that it had one
petal more than any other blossom in all
the fairy domain. She found the descent
of the glass mountain very difficult. The
glass tore her shoes and lacerated her
cuticle, but when she reached the mount
ain's base'disheveled and breathless, she
held up her flower and said :
"You can't fool me!"
The beneficent fairy pointed out that
the extra petal had been lost in the de
scent.
The lady from Borneo and I were in an
icecream "parlor.". We were fathoming
the depths of two glasses of icecream
soda with spoona of long reach but small
capacity.
"I tell you, Mary," said a trim little
woman at the next table, "I saved money
by looking about. I -walked ten blocks to
do it, but 1 bought those buckles for 25
cents, and don't you think the mean thing
at 's charged me 30 cents for them
Dear me, it was warm work though and
I got so heated that I came here for some
icecream. How raucfa? >; [This to a clerk.]
The lady of San Francisco paid 10
cents, and there was no beneficent fairy to
call her attention to the fact that her
flower of economy was two petals short.
A child of six summers was eating ice
cream and had a bag of candy near us.
"Yes," the little lady from Borneo said,
deprecatingly and refraining from look
ing at tue child, for fear she might hurt
my National pride, "we practice, some of
us, infanticide in Borneo."

Aerial J?egioi\s
Sooner or later the inventive eenius of
man will solve the flying-machine prob
lem and give us aerial navigation. Tbe de
mand for such mode of locomotion is
prowin*, and it is on* of the characteristic
features of latter-day civilization thai
when a desire becomes a popular demand,
there always materializes something to
satisfy the want. Fifty years ago any
scheme to navigate the air was laughed a:
with derision ; to-day the foremost minds
in t&e realm of science are engaged in
perfecting the means of navigating the
air. and the aeroplane is about to be added
to the list of reliable machines engaged in
rapid transit.
America is, as usual, in the lead in the
matter of constructing a flying machine
that will fly. Maxim, and latterly Profes
.ineley. have built practical machines
;:;at satisfy ail demands except in one par
ticular, the power to remain suspended
over a fixed spot, and it is announced that
this problem is solved, though the details
of the principle and its mode of applica
tion have not been made public until now.
Desirable aerial navigation demands the
employment of two functions â ouoyancy
(the power to suspend a body in the air
without moving it from piace to place)
and dirigibihty (the power to move the
body in The air vertically and horizontally,
as may be desired).
The first function may be accomplished
by the use of a gas lighter than the at
mosphere, as is now employed in the ordi
nary balloon. But by the uÂ»e of pas the
other funcuon is rendered difficult of ac
complishment, for the preat Bin of the
gasbag oifers too large a surface to the
action of wind currents; besides, the great
d tti:uixr of maintaining a perfectly im
i>ervious envelope with which to conserve
tbe buoyancy. The function of dirigibii
ity is practically impossible of accom
plishment with the gas baiioon.
The successful aerostat must, therefore,
be constructed upon line? radically differ
e-.u from old systems. It must be totally
<iifferent from tbe "balloon," and formu
lated on the application of entirely new
I rinciples, and in its mechanical struct axe
bear no resemblance to tbe big bag of gas.
Careful experimenting has aetermined
that it is feasible to maintain at an eleva
tion in the atmosphere a fist body, such as
a piece of board or a sheet of metal, so long
8s the material is inclined at an an?ie with
the surface of the earth and moved in a
horizontal direction at a given speed rela
tive to the body of air through which it is
To Urxload JRailWay Gars
The old-fashioned method of unloading
railway cars of indestructible substances
\rith shovels used by laborers bids fair to
soon be a thing of the past. That is, if tbe
invention of Peter Ra=cn of Cleveland,
Ohio, turns out to be all he claims it to be.
His apparatus is really a sort of elevator
and damping-cradle, operated by the sira
kiud'of hydraulic machinery, a4
thGUgu, of course, steam could be used as
well, but it would make a more expensive
piant.
The elevating cradle is placed in such a
position that a railway tract is built on it
connecting directly with the main line.
The car to he unloaded is pushed onto the
cradle and then made fast and immovable
by a series of powerful clamps that clutch
the sides of it.
When in this position cradle and car
ere hoisted to tbe dumping mechanism
directly above. The cradle is so con
s.ructed as to swing oa one of the sides by

is turned over, and as the car is held fast

top of the cradle is ooen. and allows the
liberated contents of the car to fall into

cheapen the cost of unloading as well as
expedite it.
The Tides and Death.
The Atlanta Constitution relates the fol
lowing very interesting face regarding the
effect of the tides on persons lying at the
point of death:
Tbe natives of Charleston who reside
near the beach have recently observed
that when tbe tide goes out those who are
ot the point of death expire. A gentleman
was asking whether or not the rising and
the failing of the tide had this effect upon
tbe dying in places removed from the

the boy's kite, which is maintained aloft
by the passing breeze. Tbe kite is held j
captiva to a iixed spot on tne earth and 1
the moving current of air acting upon its
inclined' surface forces it aloft. Now. j
should the air be perfectly stillâ a dead j

Much study has been given to the phe- 1
I nomenon of the flight of birds, it having j
I been hoped tbat tuerein lay the solution
[of the problem. Many birds possess the ]
1 ability of sustained flight without any ap
parent great exercise of power. The frig
i ate bird, the tachypetes aquila of the or
nithologist, will float in the upper atmos- j
phere for hours without the perceptible
' movement of a feather; but they do not
:ue in one place, their motion being
what mi^ht be termed "saiiiug." These
I birds, with a body the size of that of a
'â â  chicken, are provided with wings that
j average a spread of six feet from tip to |
â  tip. They are the true "aeroplane."
The humming-bird is an example of the i
! power of maintaining a fixed position, j
This bird may be observed a3 an appar- ;
entiy fixed speck. It may be seen borer- ,
, ing over a flower without either vertical or \
horizontal motion, its wings beating with ,
such rapidity as to render them almost \
i inviaiDle.
A great deal of inventive genius has |
been displayed in the attempt to produce !
I mechanism calculated to communicaie to ;
a properly shaped and inclined body a
speed sufficient to cause it to rise in the j
air. The solution of this problem rests '
\ entirely upon the ability to produce a !
1 power generator of sufficient lightness, j
â  Such will undoubtedly be produced before
I the close of the present century. The re
! cent discovery of the properties of acety
| line gas bids fair to render this task an
easy one.
This feature â the ability to secure flota
tion by speedy horizontal motion, is an
important factor in the accomplishment of
. aerial navigation. But there are many
: other factors essential to complete success, j
In the use of an aerostat there are times
when horizontal movement is undesirable;
â  as when it is requisite for the machine to
! maintain a fixed position of rest as regards
1 surface location; and also, to ascend and
descend vertically, and to commence and
terminate all motion without any sudden j
j or violent shock; all of which cannot be 1

I be no doubt in the minds of those who
! live on the sea coast that life becomes ex
tinct, especially in the case of old persons,

' any scientific research has ever been made
on this subject could not be ascertained.
Every one. however, almost without ex
ception, who'- was spoken to, ' knew that
it was a fact, and the general impression
seemed to be that it was caused by some
electrical force controlled by the coming

The body or "boat" is of aluminum. At J
either end is a screw propeller, which 'â â 
when in motion communicates progres- ;
sive movement. These screws are pro- j
vided with universal joints, and are con- j
trolled by a steering wheel placed in the
boat, and may be made to assume an ang
ular position, so that the machine can be 1
steered in any desirable direction with
ease and certainty. The large fan screws
revolving at the top of the machine lift or
depress the aeroplane according as they
are revolved to tbe right or left. Two j
large wings, adjusted by hinged bearings, i
one on each side of the body of the ma- .
chine, furnish the necessary sliding sur- i
face, analogous to the wings of tbe float- \
ing bird. These wings are so attached as
to be controlled by proper ropes or stays,
and can be adjusted at any desired angle,
both horizontally and vertically.
Up to the present time the main dim- â 
culty in the accomplishment of success
has been the weight of the engine neces
sary to drive the screws. Mr. Maxim has j
A GERMAN PATENT FOR LAYING RAILROAD TRACK.
Aerial Bicycle
There is a likelihood that the problem of
rapid transit has been solved by Hiram
Mikerson of Stoughton, Mass. He has
invented an apparatus that he calls the
"aerial bicycle," although it travels on a
rail.
The rail for this apparatus is on a post
that carves outward several feet at the top,
and the rider sails along beneath the rail.
Two wheels run on the rail. They are
connected by a tiepiece, to which is fast
ened a framework that extends downward.
At tbe end of this framework is a pro
pelling mechanism, seat and handle being
very much like the ordinary bicycle. The
pedals are driven in the ordinary way, and
power is communicated to tbe wheels
above by an endless chain that passes
along the framework and over one of the
hubs.
Such a railway should be very cheap to
build, and it has the advantage of not
taking up any ground to speak of, as crops
can be grown between the posts. Consid
erable speed ought to be developed with
very little power.
Genuine egret feathers are sold as arti
ficial in London in order to salve the con

wear bird feathers in their headgear. The
society for the protection of birds had
shown that tbe egret, or white heron,
would soon be exterminated, us the feath
ers mast be obtained during the nesting
season. Its agents have now proved that
the only artificial thing about the feathers
sold is that they are split in two, thus
making two plumes instead of one.

Motor Bicycle
One of the first patents granted for
motor bicycles is the property of Charles
H. Barrows of Willamantic, Conn. Just
what the machine will do can only be
determined by experiment, but it seems to
be built on scientific principles.
The general appearance of the bicycle is
much like the first "safety" invented that
was called the "kangaroo." The hind
wheel is of the ordinary style, but the
frame of the machine is very heavy as is
necessary to carry the propelling appara
tus.
Mounted on either side of the hind
wheel are storage batteries that are con
nected by wires with a twin motor
mounted on the steering bead. The front
wheel really has two tires, and between
them a driving surface over which a chain
passes, and thence over a driving surface
between the armatures of the twin motor.
This secures direct connection without
possibility of slipping and puts the power
at the point of least resistance. Of course
the motor will have to make a great num
ber of revolutions to one of the wheel, but
this la easily accomplished under tne cir
cumstances.
The apparatus mentioned should cer
tainly be capable of driving tbe bicycle
over a level road at a fair pace, and if
enough power is generated by tbe storage
battery also be capable of climbing hills.

carriages are painted according to tho

of the bicycle fad there remain many who
look upon the wheel as an invention of
Satan, specially devised for the purpose of â

who have not time to indulge in senti- {
ment, are not deterred in their labors by
any apprehension of orthodox timidity,

changes its natural color, red, to white at
once, at the upper end of the cord. It
kÂ»eps its color along the cord in propor
tion to the purity of the air, not changing
at all if the air is perfectly pure. A grad
uated scale fixed to tbe cord marks the
degree of impurity.

While admiring the spirit which prompts

that direction make possible the economic
transmission of power over long distances.
The scientific triumph is Tesla's. The
power will be transmitted to the Buffalo
city line by overhead conductors. From
tbe dynamo it will pass through a trans
former, which will give it a much higher
voltage, and in tnat condition it can be
safely and economically transmitted, to be
transformed ajjain at the Buffalo station to
a direct current ready for use. The higher
the voltage the less is tbe loss. Some idea
of the value of the new system can be had
by comparison. The two-phase system
transmits power so that there is a loss 400
times greater in the transmission of 500
volts than in the transmission of 10,000
volts.â New York Post

Robert Beherends of Fran kfort-on-t he-
Main, Germany, has been granted patents
for a machine intended to lay railway
track at a rapid pace. The idea of this
invention is that the work of fastening the
rails to the ties, at the proper distance
apart, can be done in a factory while the
road is being graded. When that is done
the machine will lay the sections out in
front of itself and proceed over them as
soon as the joints have been bolted to
gether.
Tbe machine consists of a heavy truck
with an inclined track mounted on it, over
which a grappling movement travels.
The rail sections are piled six or eight
deep on small tracks, which in turn are
mounted on flat cars having a track on top
of each and also connected between the
cars, so that the trucks can be moved from
one end of the train to the other.
When ready for work the track-laying
machine is put at the head of the train of
freight cars. Ona of the cars is directly
under the gripper mechanism, so that a
section of rails can be raised onto the in
clined track. The gripper movement is
then allowed to slide down tbe inclined
track, which pushes the rail section out the
right distance beyond tbe completed track
and until they strike the ground. The
train of cars is then ''backed up" a few
feet and the other end of the section drops
off.
It is then only necessary for a few men
with crowbars to slide the section to just
the right place and bolt the ends of the
rails together. While this is being done
another section of rail can be hoisted into
position, and the machine can then go
ahead over the new track and repeat the
operation just described. When one pile
of rails is exhausted from the nearest
freight car the trucks that carried them
are lifted off and the pile of rails behind
rolled forward into position.
This apparatus should lay rails at a very
rapid rate, and in time of war ought to
prove most valuable.

If there is any reason why theater-goers
should fail to enjoy themselves during the
next seven days such reason is not easily
perceived. The poet argues fairly that
"beauty is its own excuse for being, and
the Â«ame applies to the stage, the quick
ener of imagination, the brightener of
dull wits, the prince of satirists and the
magician which drives dull care before it.
Only there are degrees, of course. Some
times the lather of a family shakes a du
bious head because the drama conceals its
moral purpose. Just now it is only neces
sary to glance at the local programmes to
see gayety and innocence gamboling hand
and band before the footlights, and it is a
refreshing vision. And, by the way, all
the theaters are "doing quite well.
Some of the Eastern dramatic writers
are complaining that few new plays are
coming on. Hilary Bell, in the New \ ork
Press, for instance, remarks that the in
fluence of Oscar Wilde's dramatic work
explains "the present apathy of the Eng
lish drama," and draws a picture at once
pathetic and semi-humorous, when Wilde
is simultaneously portrayed as thriving
and taking on flesh upon the treadmill,
but at tbe same time gettin? ready
to exercise an "unnecessary influence"
when he shall resume the pen. The truth
may be that fewer plays are being staced,
but that does not tell the whole story.
There are old plays and old operas by the j
score which survive and solely by the hold :
they have upon tne sympathies of the i
play-goers, and they will demand and se- i
cure hearing and rehearing until the
standard of taste shall be radically
changed.
Locally the admixture of plays well
known and of those less well known
at home bnt more or less having sent their
fame achieved ou Eastern stages to pre
cede them seems well calculated to please.
The list of the week embraces: "Two Or
phans." "The Masqueraders," "The Irish
Artist," "The Great Unknown." "The |
Huguenots," "The Bohemian Girl" and \
the "numerous attractions of tbe OrDheum !
and the Chutes Casino. That is a greater
variety than any Eastern city is offering
for the coming week. If that last state
ment has any bearing it is to < nforce the j
belief that San Francisco will some time
be the great theater town of the United |
States, taking the year through from be- j
ginning to end, for personal comfort has
much to do with box-office finances.
That brings up another statement cur
rent in the East that He people of New
York spend annually about $8,000,000 in
the theaters. While that is a large sum,
the average per capita of population is
probably now much larger in San Fran
cisco. Some facts concerning the outlook
for the coming week are given below.
At the Baldwin.
A gieat impression has been made by
Henry Arthur Jones' "The Masquerad- |
ers," which Charles Frohman's Empire I
Theater Company is to present for the first
time in this City at the Baldwin Theater
Monday evening. The play had a great
run of over 200 nights at the home theater,
and the hit, of the company's present en
gagement is expected to be made by it.
The story is as follows: David Remon, an
astronomer, becomes enamored of Dulcie
Larondie. At a hunt ball, which brings j
together many ladies and gentlemen in |
glorious costumes, a kiss is sold at auc
tion for the benefit of the widow of a man
who has been killed in the hunt. Dulcie |
â¢is to furnish the kiss. Lord Skene, a titled j
libertine, bids for tt;e favor going beyond |
the limit of his poor resources and captures
the kiss for 3000 pounds. More than thi3,
Lord Skene offers to the barmaid the title
of Lady Skene and as she has always had
a desire to shine and enjoy life she accepts
the offer. In the bidding tor the kiss Skene's
strongest opponent was David Remon, an
astronomer, who had a feeljng oi love for
the barmaid. In the second act Sir brice j
has been a married man for four years ami j
has managed to ruin himself on the turf. |
Remon is still the friend of the wife, who j
has been requested by the husband to bor- j
row of David and she does it to the tune j
of 6000 pounds.
Nine months afterward, at Nice, we find
Sir Brice more brutal and reckless than j
ever. Remon is just about to start for I
Africa on a scientific expedition, and has
come to Nice to say good-by. Sir Brice
insists that his wife should secure more
money from him. She refuses, and he
threatens to rob her of her child. Remon
arrives, and Dulcie confides her troubles
tc him. When she learns of the dancer
ous expedition he is about to undertake,
she begs of him to give up the idea. He
refuses, but the love between them asserts
itself, and with a passionate outburst he
renounces all thought of the journey, and
declares that their lives are their own. Sir
Brice has been a silent witness of this
passionate love scene. It does not seem to
have tne least effect upon him, so far as
outward appearances go. He suggests to
Remon that they play at cards for the
money that is owing the astronomer.
Remon, ancered and desperate, refuses the
challenge, but offer* to stake his fortune,
200,000 pounds ($1,000,000) against Sir
Brice's wife and child. Sir Brice acquiesces.
Remon wins. The fourth act takes place at
Remon'i eyrie observatory on the Alps,
where 'the astronomer has taken Lady
Skene, and it is here that the dramatic
story finds the end.
Manager Charles Frohman has sent all
the elaborate scenery, costumes and acces
sories across the continent for this big pro
duction, which will no doubt create great
dramatic interest. It contains no end of
striking and well-developed situations
which call for artistic acting. Its first pro
duction to-morrow night will allow us the
opportunity o! witnessing its famous and
niuch-taiked-of card-cutting scene in the
third act, where Sir Brice stakes his wife
and child against his opponent's fortune.
This situation is one of the most intensely
dramatic ever put in a play, and as car
ried out by William Faversham, Robert
Edeson and Viola Alien is made the very
most of.

The comedy shows how a pretty young
wife who, to get revenge on her late-hours
keeping husband, went out with a Iriend
of his to spend a pleasant evening, and
had anything but the good time she ex
pected. She and her companion are ar
rested and get into numerous other diffi
culties, which keep them in hot water all
through the four acts of the i4*K. The
farce is now running at Hooley r 8 Theater,
Chicago.
Galiforrvia Jheater.
Chauncey Oicott, tne sweet singer, has
completely captured the theater-goers of
this City, and his success at the California
Theater has been immediate and brilliant.
Few stars have brought with them such
an array of supporting talent as has this
young comedian. On Monday evening
Mr. Olcctt will bring out "TheÂ»irish Ar
tist," by George H. Jes6op and Augustus
i Pitou. The authors have departed some
what from the time-worn methods usually
employed in constructing an Irish drama.
In "The Irish Artist" there are no land
sharks, no process-serving menial, no col
lusion of the simple Irish lad and the too
confiding English soldiery.
The story of the pay is strong in its
| simplicity. There are four acts, and the
j scenes are all laid in Dim-na-cor, county
lof Wexford, in Ireland, in 1815. During
! the performance Mr. Olcott will sing the
following songs, written and composed by
himself: "My Beautiful Irish Maid,"
"Look in My Heart," "Olcott's Irish Sere
nade," "Katy Mahone," find Tom Moore's
song, "Believe me, if all those endearing
young charms." Entirely new and pic
turesque scenery has been painted by
John Young. The costumes, which are
historically correct, were designed by H.
A. Ogden. The play shows Cormac
I Cronin, his wife, Maurice Cronin, his son,
j and Maggie Cronin, bis daughter, living
j in the village of Dim-na-cor, on the coast
of Ireland.
They have for neighbors Father Dennis
Mahone, a priest, and liis niece, Kate Ma-
I hone. Cormac Cronin, while generally
j known as a fisherman, is also the head of
a band of smugglers. His son Maurice,
J who has gained some reputation in Lon
i don as an artist, is ignorant of the occupa
tion in which his father is engaged. Nor
would be have found it out but for Paddy
Biake, an idiot boy, who is clambering
through the rocks and mountains and
finds himself in the cave where the
smugglers hide their goods. As Maurice
is his friend he immediately imparts to
him the discovery.
Maurice makes up his mind to visit the
cave and learn more about Paddy's find,
but not until he has satisfied himself upon
another subject. He has learned through
the village gossip that Kate Mahone, the
girl he loves, has fallen heir to a fortune
j during his absence in London, and on this
j hinges much of the realistic story told in
the play. On Tuesday evening a benefit
is to be" tendered the Youth's Directory by
Mr. Olcott, his management and Al. Hay
man & Co. "The Minstrel of Clare" will be
presented by Mr. Olcott for the week com
mencing Monday, Angust 17.
Columbia Jheater.
The Columbia Theater has done a land
office business the past week with "A
Gold Mine." For the occasion Mrs.
Thorndyke-Boucicault was specially en
gaged by Mr. Frawley. and the event was
! made further enjoyable by the appearance
[ of Wilton Lackaye, who not long since de-
I lighted the San Francisco theater-goers
by his artistic performance of Svengali.
Mrs. Boucicault brought out the light and
shade of the part of Mrs. Meredith to ex
cellent effect.
On Monday evening a rare treat is prom
ised in the shape of one of Augustin Daly'3
successes, "The Great Unknown." Al tbe
i time of its first presentation the press of
J New York pronounced it to be one of the
j funniest comedies of the day, full of
| laughter, absurd situations and funny com-
I plications, all brought abort in a purely
I legitimate manner â not of the horse- play
I order. "The Great Unknown" is not un
j like "The Two Escutcheons," which made
| such a sensation at the opening of the Co-
I lumbia Theater this season by tbe Frawley
Company. W T ilton Lackaye played the
leading and important role when the com
! edy was first put upon the stage of Daly's
Theater. It is said to have an exceedingly
interesting plot. The following is theuast
complete:
Jeremiah Jarraway, Harry Corson Clark
(rather a large-sized mouse, likewise a some
what full-grown moth, but offering a lively
! illustration of two familiar fables); Ned Dree
mer Cousin, Frank Worthing (Ned who went
: away a Methuselah and returns a "Daiev");
The O'Donnell Don, Wliton Lackaye (with a
proverb for every occasion); Tom Proude,
I George \V. Leslie (in the musical line with a
penchant for his pupils); Patrick, Wilson
Enus (an indispensable in the Jarraway house
hold); Etna Lusus, Miss Blanche L. Bates
| (natural combination of mouse and puss â no
1 other specimen known to exist); Pansy, Miss
1 Hope Ross; her sister, Mrs Arabella Jarraway,
I Miss Madge Carr-Cook (the feline article of
j the proverb, who returns in season to catch
| the frolicking rodents); Aunt Penelope, Miss
! I'hosa McAllister (a protecting angel us well
Ihs an avenging spirit, and taking a
! deal of enjoyment out of both); Shir-
I ley Munki.'trick, Mrs. ThorndyÃe-Boucicault
(her niece, a young widow with histrionic as
pirations); Miss Twitters, Miss Lansing Rowan
(mentor and guide to the Demoiselles Jarra
way); Mile. Agathe, Miss Alice Pixley.
The entire action of the comedy passes in
the Jarraway reception and sitting room. Ten
I days are supposed to intervene between the
first and second acts; the third act follows one
day later.
Qrar\d Opera-j-louse.
"The Danites," with James M. Brophy
as Sandy McGee, has drawn crowded
houses all the past week. There will be
j no diminution of the crowds this week
either, as the "Two Orphans" will occupy
the stage with a splendid setting. The
management say that such a setting of
I melodrama has never been seen before in
San Francisco.
The full depth of tbe stage cf the Grand
'isto be employed in the second act. This
j will be when the scene is in the Gardens
lof Bel-Air. Seventy people will be
on the stage at that time. Professor
Charles F. Groeber's Mandolin and Guitar
Club, consisting of forty well-known ladies
and gentlemen, will assist.
Th<* management has engaged a number
of well-known artists especially for this
performance. Among those who will re
enforce the stock company of the Opera
house are Miss Anita Fallon, Kate Dal
! glish, Mortimer Snow and Carl Smith.
| Mr. Brophy, who in his first week was a
{ dashine young New Yorker and the past
! week has been a sturdy Westerner, will
during the coming week be the dashine
young cavalier of the last century. The
part of the Chevalier Maurice de Vaudry
will bring Mr. Brophy's talents as an
actor into play.
Qrarvd Opera Season.
Meyerbeer's classical work "The Hugue
nots" will be presented at the Tivoli
Opera-house next Monday, Wednesday,
Friday and Sunday evenings as the offer
ing for the sixth week of the season of
Italian and English grand opera, now
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1896.
being given under the direction of Gustav
Hinrichs. This famous work has been
heard but little in this City, and never at
popular prices.
The production will he a careful one as
regards scenery, costumes and accessories,
and will include Mme. Natali as Valen
tine, Nina Bertini Humphreys as Mar
guerite of Valois, Miss Bernice Holmes as
Urbano the page, Sig. Michelena as Raoul
de Nangis, Sig. Maurice de Vries as the
Count of Navarre, a part which he has
sung most successfully in Eurone and this
country ; Sig. Abramoff will be the trusty
old servant Marceli and RichardKarl the
Count of St. Bris, the father of Valentine.
The other parts will be in gooa hands,
and an augmented chorus and enlarged
orchestra will assist. On Tuesday, Thurs
day and Saturday evenings Balfe's ever
popular ballad opera, dear to the hearts
of ail music lovers, "The Bohemian Girl,"
will be sung. Much care is being taken in
the preparation for the early production
of Verdi's "Aida," also the initial presen
tation in this City of Humperdink's fairy
opera, "Hansel ami Gretel." and reproduc
tions of "II Trovatore," "La Traviata"
and "Cavalleria Rusticana."
The Orpheum.
A star comedy feature .is announced at
the Orpheum for the week in the person
of Professor T. A. Kennedy, the mesmer
ist and hypnotist. He has just arrived
from a very successful trip through Aus
tralia and New Zealand, where he made
quite a stir among the medical fraternity.
In several instances he appeared before
their societies and gave exhibitions of his
powers under the supervision of the best
known physicians of the country. How
ever, one does not have to go to Australia
for examples of the wonderful things he
has done.
In this City there are a number of cases
of quite wonderful cures from the cigar
ette, drinK and opium hubii. However,
he is not engaged by Gustav Walter to ex
pound any particular theory, but to play
the role of a lun-maker. With subjects
selected from the audience he will give an
entertainment quite as mirth-provoking
as anything ever seen on the Orpheuni
stage, which is saying considerable, for
some very funny things have been s<en
there. Biondi, the greatest of change art
ists who has ever been seen on the Pacific
Coast, will appear in new sketches. His
work is characterized by the lightning
like changes he make and his powers as'
a ventriloquist, which combined enable
him to play all the parts of a comedy.
The Nelson sisters have^ made quite a
stir among tne athletes of the City, as no
such acrobatic work has ever been seen
here, and what adds to the novelty of
their act is the fact that they are a group
of young women. Drummond Staley and
Belle Birbeck, the musical blacksmiths,
will appear in new specialties. Herr
Techow's cat show is one of the unique
and pleasing features of the bill. They
have proved one of the best drawing-cards
that has been in the Orpheum for some
time. One has to see this act to believe It
possible that a troupe of cats could be
trained to do the tricks that Herr Techow
puts his proteges through. The Black
Patti has been retained and will appear in
a new selection of songs. The programme
is of such variety as to contain something
that will more than repay the most criti
cal patron. Matinees every Wednesday
and Saturday.
Jhe Ghutes,
The bill in the Casino at the Chutes dur
ing the week has been unusually good and
the big theater has been well filled every
afternoon and evening. The "Youne San
dow," as he is called, has made a great hit
and will be retained for another week.
"Joe," the orang-outang, who does
everything but talk, is amazine all who
see him. Nothing like him has ever been
seen before in California.
Beginning next Wednesday evening.
Conn Fredericks, the "Demon Cyclisi,"
will ride a bicycle down the chutes and
land in the lake without injury to himsi-if
or machine. He successfully accomplished
the leat at Paul Boy n ton's big water show
in London and will now try it for the first
time in America^

It is said that originally Ramsay
Morris' and Hillary Bell's new play,
"The Social Trust," was called "The
Final Judgment." Morris was asked
one day if that meant the New York
judgment. He became frightened at the
thougbt that the least apprehension might
become general and so changed the title.
Possibly Georgie Cayvan may revive
"Squire Kate," Buchanan's pastoral play,
in which her greatest success at the New
York Lyceum Theater was achieved.
One of the big melodramatic productions
of next season will be "Darkest Russia,"
which will be sent to the coast with a

Bardou, in hitt customary manner, in
"Madame Sans Gene" depicts tbe fire and
fury of the sanguinary times when the

Question of

ing-Room
J. E. Dofison, the versatile character
actor of the Empire Theater Stock Com
pany, has, perhaos, no superior in thatdif
cult branch of the histrionic art which for
lack of a more precise definition is vaguely
described as "make-up." He is able to
add fifteen years to his age or take twenty
away without leaving his dressing-room,
and he change his nationality or his color
as easily as another man can his politics.
This is ail a question of "make-up," m
the art of which, as mentioned, Dodson is
a past master. Regarding his success in
this line, he says:
"What is known as a character make-un
is a very important part of. stagecraft in
these days and is increasing in import
ance. The art â for I may, I think, call it
an artâ includes types of humanity of all
ages. In our present repertory 1 play
parts ranging in age from 19 to 90. Very
youthful parts, like Sam in 'The Queen's
Shilling,' for instance, require but small
skill in the make-up â a little flesh-colored
grease paint for a groundwork, heighten
ing the cheek-Dones with carmine rubbed
in with a little brown, and using blue and
black for the eyes, blue on the upper eye
lid close to the lash, and the lash black
ened with black grease paint warmed over
the gas and applied with a pencil; that's
very simple. It's called the straight
make-up.
"Any one is equal to do that. The diffi
culty arises when the make-up is complex,
and then adequate skill is not acquired
until after years of experiment. I have
been all my life studying the art. Very
few theater-goers fully appreciate how
largely dependent upon the make-up is
the success of many a great actor in his
most famous roles. Sometimes tragedians
pay less attention to make-ups than actors
of other classes. Edwin Booth and Henry
Irving are exceptions. The famous Am
erican actor and the famous Englishman
have not been excelled in the art of
make-up.
"It is a comparatively modern art. It
did not amount to much even in Garrick's
day. unless Garrick resorted to what we
call the straight make-up. But not until
recent years has he art been brought to
its present elaborateness. The so-called
character artist make-up is really a crea
tion of the last two or three decades. Dur
ing all of that time there has been a steady
improvement, of course, but the present
absolute perfection of detail is very
recent. A curious slang expression of
tbe English greenrooms is 'a Sadler's
Wells make-up.' Sadler's Wells Theater
was for years the home of the legitimate in
London, it is associated, too, with many
Droken-down actors of the old school
crushed tragedians, a3 you may say. Now.
if an actor in England comes late to a per
formance and with an insufficient make-up
he is chaffed about his 'Sadler's Wells,'
the suggestion harking back to the days
when the make-up was improvised at

"The chief features to be considered in a
make-up are the wig, tne hair, tbe eyes,
the nose and the teeth. The wig is the
most important ingredient in a good
make-upâ a make-up which disguises the
actor and gives a natural effect. It is a
very difficult matter to get a good wig.
You have to consider the actor's physical
peculiarities as well as the type to be
represented and the idiosyncrasies of the
particular character. The wiemakmg
business is a specialty. Only a few suc
ceed at it, notably the late Rick
ards of Covent Garden, London; Clark
son of London, Meyer of New York
Buch of Philadelphia and Hepner of
Chicago. Rickards was the best perhaps.
For twenty years he made wigs for cele
brated character actors of London. Many
of my own wigs have been made of late
by Clarkson, a clever workman. I usually
give him the sketch, preparing it myself
or getting it prepared by a friend. Some
times fifteen or twenty visits are necessary
before the thing suits. A vast amount of
pains and patience is required. The wig I
wear in the role of Schumard is the third
Inad made for the part. Clarkson made
it, but he made two others before I was
satisfied.
"Hair on the face is the feature next in
importance. This is attached to the skin
by a spirit gum. Crape hair is used and
the actor can often make himself up in
this respect better than the wigmaker
could do it, except in the case of a full
beard. Eyebrows are put on with crape
hair or they may be colored in. Charles
Matthews used to say that a stage mus
tache never looked so well as when it was
painted on. But that was before the days
of a perfected make-up such as we know
now, and the painted mustache must
needs have been a very small affair indeed
to keep up an illusion under a fire of opera
glasses.
"Speaking of paint reminds me that tbe
invention of grease paint marks an im
portant advance in the art of make-up
revolutionized methods. It is made chiefly
in Germany by Leichner, and in a smaller
way by Meyer in New York. Harmless?
Yes, I think so. I never suffer any injury
from it, though rouge which has ver
milion as one of its ingredients is not
harmless, I should say. The basis of
grease paint is wax, and there is a little
olive oil in it and oxide of zinc, with such
coloring matter as may De required. But
the pigments are harmless. As a rule a
grease that closes the pores is used before
the paint is applied.
"Tbe nose, tbe ears, the chin, the cheeks
and the teeth are all tbe subjects of m.nKe
up. You may take out all your teeth, as
it were, or you may put in others. Years
ago I playec* in 'Black and White,' imper
sonating a negro. I had a set of teeth
made to fit over my own. These, pro
truding, gave me the mouth features or
tbe negro, full lips and all; but when I
went to speak I found I was unintelligible, f
It required a month's practice before I
could be understood, and then I had the
negro accent almost exactlyâ or the critics
kindly said I had. The witches in 'Mac
beth,'for instance, have false noses, false
single teeth or tusks, the latter made of
cardboard attached with cobbler's wax.
"I almost always use noses. I can maxe
them up in any shape and can defy detec
tion even in the dressing-room. There is
a nose paste made by Leichner and Meyer
which is very well in its way, but for long,
drooping noses it is impracticable. To
meet this defect I struggled for years to
got something that would do, and at last
succeeded. I can make any kind of a nose.
Not so long ago I was playing the Jew in
'After Dark.' I made up a nose to suit tbe
part. One night at the close of tbe per
formance I was sent for by a Jewish gen
tleman who wished to meet me. I divested
myself of my make-up and went to him,
saying: 'Well, sir, I am Dodson; what
can I do for you?' He replied, 'I want Mr.
Dodson, the actor.' 'But I am he.' 'No,
no,' rejoined the Jew, placing bis finger
upon his nose, 'he is one of us.' He had
been completely deceived by the make-up,
and it is really remarkable how small and
fine are the modelings of the nose needed
to get a particular effect. I may say lam
a believer in noses as indexes oi character.
I use a made nose as Schaumard.
"All sorts of eyes can be made up. A
squint eye or a wall eye is the result of
fastening a piece of fine muslin on tbe
upper lid, gumming it down and painting
a false eye on the whole. Squeers, in
'Nicholas Nicklcby,' is usually made up in
that fashion.
"In making up one has to consider the
size of the theater, the strength of the
electric light and gas and the effect to be
produced at the same moment in the front
of the audience and in the highest gallery.
The make-up must not be too strong for
the former or too weaK for the latter. I
generally try my make-up Beveral times
before the dress rehearsal, but I don't
know whether this is usual.
"Of course I need hardly say that make
up includes costume and all its details,
gloves, hat, glasses, shoes, etc. AH these
things have to be closely regarded with a
view to a symmetrical and artistic whole.
But that, I take it, is pretty generally un
derstood even by the people who know
little of the intricacies of character make
up.
"It is a rather curious fact that I am
often accosted by people who say, 'Why,
Mr. Dodson, I thought you. were an old
I man.' They can scarcely believe that I
am a young man. I always consider this
mistake a kind of oblique compliment.
"Who are most successful in character
make-up? I should s>Â«y E. M. Holland
and W. H. Thompson in this country, and
in England John Hare, Beerbohm Tree
and Mr. Mackintosh among character
actors."

NEW YORK MARKETS.
f Financial.
â¢ NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. B.â The volume of
business during the short session of the Stock Ex
change to-day was by no means large, still at in
tervals the depression was quite pronounced. At
the opening the market was adversely affected by
lower cables from London and the active list fell
about 1 per cent. The decline induced extensive
purchases 'to cover short contracts and a sharp
rail v of i/iÂ©'- 1 .! per cent followed. Sugar led the
advance, selling up from 96 to 98*4. The Im
provement In the general list ranged from %to
'â Â£ S A per cent and was well distributed.
Before the expiration of the first hour, however,
the selling was renewed on a heavy scale; the
gains previously noted were not only wiped - out,
but some of the standard stocks sustained severe
losses. The selling pressure was as pronounced
after the publication of the bank statement. The
statement showed a contraction in loans and an
enormous loss in legal tenders. The reduction in
the surplus reserve to below $14,000,000 encour
aged the belief that rates for money will rule
higher in the immediate future. This, of course,
will operate against the bulls on stocks.
In the lust hour of business Sugar, Manhattan,
Chicago Gas, the Grangers, Louisville and Nash
ville and Western Union were particularly promi
nent. Sugar broke SiÃ to 9 5 Vs. preferred 3 to
92 Vi, Manhattan 3Â»,i to 76%. Northwest, *3.4 to
8-71 A, St. Paul 2Va 10 60ViÂ» Rock Island 2>/Â± to
49 1 Chicago Gas 2Va to 44E ; g, Louisville and
Nashville lV 8 to 38^4 and Western Union 1% to
7oyÂ«. In the inactive issues, Metropolitan trac
tion broke to 80 Vi, Minnesota and bi. Louis iirtt
preferred 8 to 46 and Susquehanna and Western
preferred 3% to 12. â¢ '
1 ne absence of failures at the Stock Exchange,
considering the great shrinkage In values of late,
was the subject of much discussion. Brokers gen.
erally are in good shapt^ and there will be no
trouble unless the banks should advance interest
rates to very much . hlgner rates than those now
prevailing. In view of the efforts on the part of
the local financial institutions to protect the treas
ury go d reserve, it is safe to assume that stock
brokers will be acsordea all the accommodations
necessary to carry on their business. In the final
dealings a few stocks recovered fractionally from
the low point of she morning, but speculation was
feverish and unsettled.
Net changes show losses of V*@3per cent. To
tal sales were 136,432 shares, including 21,600
suear. 17,600 St. Paul and 10,800 Western Union.

A TURKISH LIBRARY.
Predicted Over by a Librarian "Who
Speaks No Language but His Own.
We found -a charming old Turkish libra
rian, speaking no language but his own,
but proud of and devoted to the books un
der his care. He had six or eight intelli
gent assistants. We were soon seated at
a table, a carefully prepared and very full
catalogue before us, and our friend, Sadik
Bey, at hand as interpreter. It was touch
ine to see the genuine anxiety of the old
librarian to find any boot my husband
wished to see, and he was ably seconded
by his assistants. They first brought us
some exquisite Persian manuscripts, beau
tn'ully illuminated and bound; and when
we made them understand that mv hus
band would like to see any books in the
library from India, they eagerly produced
all they had, but they proved to be chiefly
modern works on music. After they had
brought us some fine manuscripts of the
Koran with glosses and commentaries,
they asked us to walk about and examine
the general contents of the building.
The bookcases were ol the best con
struction, with movable shelves, and at
one end we found a very good collection
of English, French and German classics.
ThG center of the room was occupied by
glass cases filled with gorgeously bound,
illustrated works,, c iefly gifts to the Sul
tan. While my husband, with the aid of
Sadik Bey, was talking to the old libra
rian, the assistants snowed my son and
me some fine photographs of places in
the Sultan's domains and of public build
ings in Stamboul.

INVESTIGATING
GRADERS' CAMPS,
Labor Bureau Officials on
a Tour of Inspec
tion.
SAW FOUR COLONIES.
All Kinds of Accommodation,
From Cleanliness to
Filth.
WHY THE MEN COMPLAIN.
Some Want Better Food, Some More
of It, and Some Want Shorter
Hours.
When living in the rough, inconvenient
manner similar to graders' camps, comfort
is a relative t*rm, and the little neces
saries of more civilized life are not consid
ered, but the place can, at least, be kept
clean, and that this is not always done is
easily seen.
The men at the camps are not all satis
fied with. their surroundings. They have
been complaining, and in pursuance of
their complaints C. L. Dam and C. M.
Grim, from the office of the State Labor
Bureau, have been investigating.
On Friday they visited four graders'
camps, and to-day they will make report.
Their report will lead to some improve
ment in at least one, for John Tuttle's
camp on Haight street, between Fillmore
and Steiner, will not be spared in their
report.
A sand lot littered .with old wagons,
broken wheels and pieces of iron, sur
rounded by ramshackle buildings, in some
of which horses live, in others men, and a
pronounced "stable" smell, constitutes
Tuttle's camp. There are about twenty
five men in his camp, ail of whom take
their meals in the cookhouse, and fifteen
of whom sleep in the bunkhouses. There
are thirty horses in the stables.
The stables are cleaned out every morn
ing, but not so the rooms. The dirt on
the windows and the floors and the walls
and ceilings has not settled since yester
day nor the day before, nor the week be
fore, nor last March, nOr is the "human"
poison-like smell a thin*; of a week or a
month. The rooms are pooriy liehted
from the dirt on the windows, there is no
circulation and the sashes look as if they
were never raised, and the beds â they dis
courage any but distant inspection.
These things the investigators took note
of and then passed into the cookhouse.
It was not badly kept and the utensils
seemed clean, but the place is small and
stuffy.
Some sleeping-rooms are in the same
building as the kitchen and dining-room
and the rooms are small.
Three men are in one room, two in
another and more are in other rooms.
Another â¢'bunkhouse" is across the lot
from the "cookhouse," and two more men
sleep in a room off one of the stables. The
men work ten hours a day and say that
they are not badly treated. The labor
deputies will recommend, however, that
Tuttle be given ten days to put his dormi
tories in proper condition or tear them
down.
A. E. Buckman's camp at Steiner and
Waller, where it was said typhoid fever
was rampant, was found to be the cleanest
and best ordered of those visited. The
kitchen and dining-room are in one build
ing and the dormitory or bunkhouse is
situated far enough away to secure com
plete isolation for each. There are fifty
five rooms in tbe bunkhouse, a window in
each, and in each are two spring beds.
Sheets and good blankets are provided for
each bed, and there is an attendant whose
business it is to keep the rooms clean and
in order.
There were no sick men in the camp
yesterday, nor had there been, the men
said. Their principal cause for complaint
was the food. Not the dinner, bat the
breakfast and lunch. They say those
meals are not fit in quantity and quality
for working men.
Murphy's camp at Harbor View houses
thirty-five men in a rough redwood bunk
house.
The bunks are of straw and the men can
replace the straw when they see fit. The
blankets belong to the men. A neighbor
ing hotel boards the laborers under a con
tract with Murphy. The men complain
that they are worked over hours, but be
yond that they are content.
Frank Seminaris, better known as
"French" Frank, has a camp on Geary
and Fil'.more streets. Only three men
sleep at the camp, and their bunks form
the second story to the stable stalls. But
they, too, are content.
Those conditions will form the basis for
the Deputy Commissioner's reports to
day. They will also be brought to the at
tention of the Board of Health, and that
body, too, may take* a hand in cleaning
camp surroundings.
In response to a courteous letter from
Contractor Buckman asking the Health
Officer to visit the camp, Dr. Lovelace sent
a curt reply to the effect that he was satis
fied that the camp was in bad sanitary
condition and that he did not deem any
further investigation necessary. He stated
that his authority for the allegation that
typhoid patients had been taken from the
camp to the City and County Hospital
was the word of Superintendent Stahle of
me hospital.
CONVICT-MADE GRAIN BAGS.
What the San Quentin Jut em ills Have
Done This Tear.
The State Board of Prison Commission
ers was to have met yesterday, but the
meeting was postponed owing to the un
avoidable absence of several of the mem
bers. At the next meeting some atten
tion will be paid to the grain-bag industry
and the jute in ills. From January 1 to
date Warden Hale has sold 2,951,000 grain
bags, although the season ' did not start
until March. The July output of tha mill
was 257,600, besides 59,000 sugar bags for
the Sandwich Island trade. There are now
on hand 2,578,000 grain bags.
It is expected that at least 1,000,000 bags
will be ordered by the farmers, as there are
several localities where the threshing will
not be in full swing until the middle of
September. Orders are still coming in
from the Sacramento and San Joaquin
valleys, while in the Siskiyou district
threshing has just begun.
The returns ou the bags sold so far j

amount to $124,000. A part of this has
been expended for jute, but there is $70,
--000 now in the revolving fund. It will
take $30,000 more to till this fund, after
which any excess may be used for im
provements in and about the prison. The
desire of the directors recently .to dispose
of a large quantity of the surplus bags on
hand was to prevent being obliged to draw
on the general fund to pay the running
expenses of the jutemill.
One of the newspapers recently made an
unfavorable comment upon the quality of
the bags produced, but the Warden is in
receipt of many flattering testimonials,
showing the bags to be of excellent mate
rial and construction, in fact, superior to
the bags made in Calcutta. C. A. Sperry,
manager of the Dig Patterson ranch in
Stanislaus Connty, writes that the bags
are of tbe first quality, while the annexed
letter from Senator Boggs of Coluaa
County speaks for itself:
Princeton, Coluea County.
Hon. W. E. Haleâ Dear Sib: I inclose here
with my check for $630 to pay for 15,000
wneat sacks. Tbe 30,000 sacks you sent me in
June are the best I ever used, and I congratu
late you on turnine out the best sacks ever
made at the prison or anywhere else. Another
season, if commenced in time, with a good,
active agent to canvass the country, and you
will have a good demand ana find sale for all
you can make. Yours truly. John Boggs.

CRUMBLING TO RUIN,
Two-Story Building on Third
Street Loses a Sustaining
Wall.
Timbered Up With Huge Joists It
Seems to Be Resting Upon
Stilts.
On the northeast corner of Third street
and Sherwood place stands a two-story
wooden structure which in its present
condition is a wonder to the neighbor
hood. The entire south wall of the lower
story is gone so that one side of the upper
story would fall were it not for half a doz
en sky-scraping joists which are braced up
by the curbstone on the south side of Sher
wood place and which are notched at
their upper ends. Into these notches tbe
floor timbers of the upper story are fitted.
The whole building has been getting
reaav to fall for some time. The lower
story began to bulpe, and. whiie the upper
story Kept an upright position in itself, it
was ready to sag over and go down with a
crash whenever the lower story let go.
The progress of disintegration ha* been
steady for a year, at least. Very lately the
building began to give signs that it was
getting ready to drop soon.
On the lower floor is a saloon kept by
E. P. Modry & Co. On the upper floor
are tenements. Some tenants moved out
a few days ago, but the saloon people re
mained, as they have a lease. The wall
bulged and finally either dropped or was
pulled out. Then workmen came with
the sky-climbing joists and jacks and
screws and propped the building so that
some tenants of the upper story returned
to their quarters.
Now the saloon has only a temporary
wall of rough boards, in fact only a fence
on the south side. Notification has been
received that the premises will be repaired.
This practically amounts to rebuilding the
south side of the lower story. The owner
of the property lives in the East and is
represented by a local agent.

CHARITY IN A
FESTIVE GUISE,
Grand Promenade Concerts
Projected for the
Autumn.
PLAN OF BENEVOLENCE.
Funds to Be Raised to Recon
struct the German
Hospital.
HANDSOME EDIFICES OF STONE
They Will Be Erected on the Latest
Improved Plansâ Festival Com
mittees Appointed.
It is the avowed purpose of the German
Benevolent Society to reconstruct the
buildings now comprised under the gen
eral term of the German Hospital, by re
placing the present structures with hand
some stone edifices. The matter has been
under consideration for some time past,
but, owing to the period of depression
which came in with the Cleveland ad
ministration, the project was held in
abeyance and not made public until now,
when the first great step toward that end
is about to be taken in co-operation with
the German Ladies' General Benevolent
Society.
During the coming autumn a monster
musical festival will be held at the Me
chanics' Pavilion, the proceeds of the
same to be set sside aa part of a special
fund to be used for the purpose mentioned!.
Shortly after it was decided to abandon
the idea of erecting at once the new build
ings the constitution of the society was
amended so as to create a special fund
out of all donations, bequests and other
sums of money that come to the society
outside of its regular sources of revenues.
This special fund is to be applied to the
great work of reconstruction on the latest
and most improved plans of all the hos
pital buildings. It is to this fund that the
proceeds of the projected festival will be
added.
At a recent meeting of the society a fes
tival committee was appointed by Presi
dent B. Broemmel to arrange for the
grand event. It comprises the following
members <f the two societies named:
Mrs. Kegensberger, Mrs. Kreu'zmann,
Mrs. Bowman, C. Uhlig, W. Hermann
and C. Goecker.
This committee at a meetine held on
Wednesday decided to hold the festival
on the evenings of the 17th and 18th of
October next in the Mechanics' Pavilion.
It will consist of two crand promenade
concerts, to continue from 8 to 11 o'clock
on each of the evenings named. The
music will be furnished by a brass band
under the leadership of Qustav Hiuricbs.
The following committees were ap

ELMHURST SURPRISE,
Friends of Miss Edwards Cele-
brate Her Sixteenth Anni
versary.
Elmhurst society turned out in force last
evening and rendered an agreeable surprise on
Miss Emma Edwards, a popular and accom
plished young lady of tbe pretty little town, in
henor of her sixteenth birthday.
The affair was the social event of the season
at Elmhurst, and the surprise party the young
lady was the recipient of when just "sweet
sixteen" will long live in her memory.
After retiring for the night thinking what a
cold birthday she had passed with not one
word of consolation from her friends a knock
was heard at the door and two score of smiling
and happy faces, equipped with the good
things of life, announced that they had come
to celebrate Miss Edward*' anniversary.
Although taken completely by surprise the
young lady got up and acted the hostess of the
occasion most gracefully and a right good
time was had until the "wee sma' hours" of
the morning.
Games, singing, oratorical and musical se
lections were indulged in until midnight,
when the party repaired to the spacious and
highly embellished dining-room and did jus
tice to the ample repast set oefore them, while
the martial strains of music from a stringed
orcnestra stationed in the hall served as a
healthy appetizer.
Selections were given by the following: Miss
Irene Rice, vocal solo*; Mrs. Gilbert and
Mrs. Martin and the Misses Keating, vocal
solos; Miss Edwards, piano solo; Jesse
Swalley, songs and jokes; William Cotter,
recitations; William A. McGrill. songs and

WILLEY FORCED
TO SURRENDER.
A Pioneer Merchant at the
Mercy of His Credi
tors.
BUSINESS WAS SLACK.
Too Few Sales and Small
Profits Eat Up His
Assets.
ONLT HIS STOCK TO OFFER.
Creditors Hold a Meeting, but Defer
Action Pending an Investiga
tion.
Otis F. Willey, one ol San Francisco's
pioneer merchants, has been forced to
acknowledge his inability to meet his
obligation* and has offered to surrender
his assets for the benefit of his creditors.
This move was precipitated by attachment
proceedings, instituted by H. H. Baboock,
an Eastern wholesaler, who is Willey' s
principal creditor.
Willey, under the name of 0. F. Willey
& Co., though the "Co." was a commercial
fiction, has been doing business as a dealer
in buggies, carriages, harness, etc., in this
City for nearly forty years. For several
years past his establishment has been
located at 317 Montgomery street and he
was considered to be perfectly sound.
At a meeting of his creditors, held at
the office of Freidenrich, Naphtaly &
Ackerman, the debtor's attorney, yester
day forenoon, Attorney Naphtaly, stated
that Willey had been losing money at his
business for some years. As a result the
business had eaten up everything he had,
and with liabilities of $34,000 he had
practically'nothing to offer as assets but
his stock. This had cost him $17,000, but
it would be difficult to state what it
would bring at a forced sale. Willey has
some property on California street, some
on Third and one or two outside lots, but
they are so effectually covered by mort
gages as to be unavailable in an emer
gency.
The creditors, who were mainly Eastern
parties, decided to place the matter in the
hands of H. H. Babcock, he being the
heaviest creditor, to investigate and re
port next Monday at 2 o'clock when an
other meeting will be held. All of the
creditors expressed themselves as satisfied
with Willey's statement of bis condition,
and it may be deemed wise to allow him
to proceed to unload his stock. Among
the local creditors are the First National
Bank, the Nevada Bank and Christopher
Buckley.
The indebtedness to local parties is
mainly for money borrowed. The claims
of Eastern creditors, which constitute the
major portion of the obligations, are for

The time will never come when you'll pay as I I
much for linens here as they cost you in other |
stores, because we gather them direct in largest

more. ji
