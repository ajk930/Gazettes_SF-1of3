Loyal and Honest C:tizsns of

NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. s.â An unas
â¢ .sailable column of 264 electoral votes has
been secured for McKinley and HoDart.
â  This column may be increased by the
addition of the votes of the States of Ken -
tucky, South Dakota and Wyoming,
wheh are still in doubt and claimed for
both McKinley and Bryan.
.â¢ The popular majority for McKinley will
De about 1,000,000. It now exceeds 90u,000,
and can scarcely be reduced more than
30,000 by the aegregated pluralities for
Bryan from all the States In doubt.
In the Senate the Republicans are as
sured of forty--ix members, or a majority
of two. The majority may be increased
â¢ to four by the election oi a Republican
from Kentucky.
According to the latest returns the Re
publicans will have in the House 211 mem
bers, sound-money Democrats 1, Demo
crats 120, Populists 25, giving a Republi
â  can majority of 65.
The power of the Republicans may be
somewhat affected in the Senate by the
future course of the several Senators who
were elected as Republicans, but have
bolted the party and acted durine the
campaign just Â«nded with the Chicago
Democrats.
Mantle of Montana, Pettigrew of South
Dakota and Cannon of Utah have all
openly affiliated with the Democrats. If
ail these Senators vote politically with the
Populists or the Democrats, they may be
in the way of Republican majority as to
prevent a reorganization. All told, how
ever, it is doubtful whether the. silver men
â¢ in the Senate will be able to muster a ma
. jority.
Putting all the bolting Republican Sen-
ators in the silver column and adding to
them all the continuing silver Senators,
qnd Senators Fauikner, Gorman and
Mitchell of Wisconsin, who accepted the
Chicago platform and advocated its prin
'â ciples, the silver cause will not appar
. ently be able to muster more than forty
two votes after March 3. 1897. This as
sures a gold standard majority in the
Senate of at ieast six votes.
ELECTORAL VOTE, 264.
Vice-Chairman Payne Content to
: R~st on That Total.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 5.â Vice-Chair-
man Payne of the Republican National
. Committee was cont nt to-day to rest
upon the total of 264 electoral votes
for McKinley. He >aid he could have
added one more as sur- for the President
. electâ that of one elector from Wyoming,
who is said to have slipped in a winnei be
cause the middle-of-the-road Populist
elector had refused to withdraw and drew
Vital strength from the Fusion ticket.
Mr. Payne said nis advices from Chair- j
man Roberis of the Kentucky committee j
assured him that State's rote woul i be for j
McKinley, but it would require the official
. count to determine what the majo ity was.
' At present be claimed it by 1200. This
Hate would give McKinley 280 electoral
votes. The following telegram was re
ceived from thecnairman of the Wyoming
State Committee:
"Republicans carry eight counties for
' the National and State tickets. One
county not heaad from. Have certainly
one Presidential elector and Supreme
Judge. State is very close, but returns
received indcate the election oi the re
maining two electors and Congressmen."
Chairman Gowdy telegraphed from In
dianaiois to Executive Committeeman
Durbin, sticking to his figures of last
"night as to the Republican majority in In
diana â 20,000 â and adding that Congress
men Lei-hty, Hardy, Sulzer and Trace
weil were probably def?ated, making the
d- legation nine Republicans and fjur
Democrats and both branches of the Legis
lature sure.
Mr. Payne did some figuring on the
next Senate, saying: "We will have a
majority for sound money in the Senate.
.There will be lorty-six Senators for gol.i,
forty-two for free silver and two doubtful,
tlie doub resting on the Legislature*
â¢which have just been elected. On the
question of passine a tariff bill independ
. ent of a silver rider there will be fony
sev-n for. forty against and three doubt
ful. We count on such silver Senators as
Kyle and Cannon voting with the admin
istration."
Mr, Payne was highly amused about a
telephone message which he received ilur

â ' â >n at the other end ol the wire was
â¢VHrles Phster, a prominent citizen of

A matrimonial romance in the midst of
the monotonous whirl of politics leaked
out at Republican headquarters to-day.
C. E. Mirienz, who has been secretary oi
the German bureau, and Miss Ella C.
Phillipi of Memphis, who was a steno
grapher in the department, eloped to Mil
waukee yesterday and were married at
the First German Methodist Church last
nieht.
The humor of the episode lies in the
fact that the marriage was contincent on
the election of McKinley. The couple re
turned to Chicago to-day and received a
present ana congratulations from the Na
tional Committee aud associates.
Representatives of the Chicago news
papers and press associations who have

McKINLEY'S MESSAGE.
Victory cf the People In Ignoring
Party Lines.
CANTON. Ohio, Nov. -s.â McKinley to
nigbi sent the following telegram to Mr.
Hanna in New Yort:
CatÂ«ton, Ohio, Nov. 5.
Hon. if. A. Hanna, WaldnrJ Hotel, Sew York:
Your telegraphic message announcing the re
sult of the election has been received. I beg
you to accept my hearty thanks for your great
services In the cause of sound money and pro
tection throughout the campaign now closed
and gloriouaiy won. They w ere most generous
and effective, and will receive the warm ap
probation of your countrymen everywhere. I
wi'.l be pleased to have you convey to your
assuoiutes of the National Committee my high
appreciation of their efficient services. Tne
people in their majesty, ignoring party lines,
have declared their detestation of repudiation
and dishonor in whatever specious guise they
may be presented.
They nave with the same mighty power
affirmed their devotion to law and order and
their undying respect for justice and the
courts. They have maintained their unfalter
ing determination to support and uphold the
constituted authorities of the country and
have thereby given vigor and strength to our
free Institutions. They have indeed again
consecrated themselves to conntry and bap
tized, the cherished ordinances oi free govern
ment with a new and holy patriotism. The
victory is not to party or to section, but of
and for the who'.e American people. Not the
least of the triumphs of the election is the
obliteration of sectional lines of the Republic.
We have demonstrated to the world thut we
are a reunited people in purpose as In name.
We have manifested in the great cause tne
spirit of fraternity and brotherhood that shall
always characterize our common and equal
citizenship, and have proven conclusively
that in a country of equal privileges and
equtii opportunities the insidious doctrine of
hale or of class or sectional distinctions can
not prevail. Let us as Americans straight
way devote ourselves to the upbuilding of
America; to the peace, honor and glory of our
common country. Party dissensions should
no longer divide or ruck the public mind, nor
the zeal or temper of either side deter any
citizen lrom patriotic devotion to the good of
all. William McKixley.
HANNA IN NEW YORK.
Talks of the Issues That Caused
Republican Success.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. s.â Mark A.
Hanna, chairman of the National Com
mittee, arrived in this city irom Cleveland
this morning. He registered at the Wal
dorf, where Mrs. Hanna and daughters
have oeen for the past month. Mr. Hanna
â¢was accompanied to this city by Colonel
S. T. Everett, a Cleveland banker.
The Republican chairman was accorded
a rousing reception at Ashtabula, Ohio,
and Erie, Pa., where he made brief
speeches. On his arrival at the Waldorf
Mr. Hanna was greeted by a host of
friends and held informal receptions. He
was in the best of spirits, but declined to
be interviewed until he had met Mrs.
Hanna and his daughters. Mr. Hanna
came downstairs in about an hour and
talked freely to the reporters.
"What, in your opinion, chanced the
farmers' vote to McKinley in the Middle-
Western States?" he was asked.
Mr. Hanna paused a moment and then
said: "Well, 'the farmers of the M.ddle
West were away off in the beginning on
the money question and on the results
that would follow McKinley's election.
They believed at first that if McKinley
was elected silver would be wiped out of
circulation. The farmers confounded the
gold standard with monometallism, but
they learn d the trutn, as the result of
the campaign shows."
"Do you think the tariff question fig
ured much in the result?"
'Yes, sir; decidedly so. It figured
very, very much, ' and Mr. Hanna
beamed all over.
Mr. Hanna was then qnrstioned about
what would be Major MrKinJey's position
on the tariff question.
"I would prefer to let Major McKinley
speak for himself ou that question," he
replied.
He then called attention to what Mc-
Kinley said at the banquet of the Mar
quette Club in Cn cago on February 12
lastâ Lincoln's binnday.
"MHJor McKinley then said," Mr.
Hanna continued, "'I am not an advo
cate for schedules, but for the principles
of protection.' "
"Do you feel that the silver question is
dead?"
'â¢Well, I feel that it is the beginning of
the end. I don't hesitate to say that the
result of this election will bring about a
serious consideration of this question and
that the opinion of the country will be re
flected in the Senate and Congress."
When asked what he thought of the ad
vance in securities since election day Mr.
Hanna said: "It was to be expected, and
I predict tdat every business interesi
which depends on confidence in our Gov
ernment, and that means all but specula
tive interest*, will be permanently bene

fited. The people are satisfied now that
tbere will be no wild financial legislation
and this confidence will bring prosperity.
We have the Presid-nt, the Senate and
the House of Representatives, so there is
no room for any kind of doubt."
Vice- President-elect Hobart dropped in
to see Mr. Hanna. He and Mr. Hanna
had a very warm handshake, and they
exchanged mutual congratulations over
the result of the election. All the execu
tive committeemen also congratulated Mr.
Hobart as Vice-President-elect. Mr. Ho-
Dart was closeted with Mr. Haroa for a
long time discussing the results of the
election. He had nothing to say for pub
lication.
Mr. Hanna said to-night h<Â» had received
a telegram from Senator Warren of Wy
oming stating that he was absolutely sure
of one electoral vote and possibly the re
maining two.
AN EXTRA SESSION.
McKinley May Call Congress After
Inauguration.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 5.â A Herald
special from Washington says:
An extra session of the F.fty-fifth Con
gress immediately after the inauguration
of McKinl y is not improbable. S ovid Mc-
Kinley desire to carry out th> spirit of his
party platform and secure the enactment
of legislation to correct existing evils in
tue monetary system, his chances for suc
cess would undoubtedly be greater if
Congress was called early, when the Re

Would lie anxious to please the President,
so as to have a voice in the distribution of

The Republican majority in the House
will be so large that any line of par'y
pol'cy decided upon can be quickly passed
in that body. The majority in the Senate,
however, is of such a character as to mtike
it probable that no important measure can
pass that body without a prolonged tight.
PRESS AND THE PEOPLE.
Both Are Given the Credit of Maln-
talnlng National Honor.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. s.â Major Mc-
Kinley found time to-night to say a few
words about the election. He spent t c
evening at home and chatted with a num
ber of his friends. To the correspondent
of the United Associated Pro ses who
asked him to what he attributed the suc
cess of the Republicans be said:
"I do not care to be interviewed, but I
will say that 1 think the patriotic effort of
the men of both the old parties have
brought about the result. Ardent and de
voted &% have been the Republicans every
where, equally pronounced and helpful
was the attitude of the sound money
Democrats. Then the press of the coun
try, the intelligent and enthusiasticefforts
of the journals oi both rattit-s, have been
a mi.hty factor in the result and aid to
the Republican cause."
CARLISLE FOR SENATOR
Bains Pushed as a Successor to Joe
B' ckburn.
LOUISVILLE, Kt., Nov. s.â Carlisle is
being pushed for United States Senator
despite the fact that the Republicans have
seventy votes, or enough to elect on joint
ballot in the Legislature.
The Evening Tjmes says: We would
not be surprised if. when Joe Blackburn
vacates his Â»eat in the S nate on the 3d of
next March, John Carlisle shall step in on
the 4th and fill it as it has not been tilled
since the mortal Clay put on immortality.
It is in the cards to transfer Carlisle f om
the Treasury to the t acitol, and they will
be played for all tbere is in them.
A dispa eh from Frankiort says Black
burn's supporters think that they have
discovered a way to prevent he election of
a Republican Senator. Judge Leiberth of
Covington, who was a member of the last
Legislature, has accepted the position of
Ch:ef of Police of Covington. They claim
that this invalidates his seat in the Legis
lature, which hi* do s not resign, and to
which it is snid Kline, R., was e.ecied at
the recent election without there having
been a special election called by Governor
Bradley, as was the case in other districts
where there were vacancies.

At 2:30 o'clock a procession was formed,
and, preceded by a brass band, marched
to the iron works. There tue furnaces
had been prepared for lighting, and
promptly at 3 o'clock President-elect Mc-
Kinley touched a button in his house at
Canton, and tne electric wire connecting
it with the furnace emitted a s; ark which
ignited the inflammable material, and
the new blast iurnaces were put in opera

A telephone message was sent to the
North-side Water Works, where a signal
was given by a s earn whittle, and soon

was observed as a holiday.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. sâ President
Gates of the Illinois Steel Company t-aid:
"In consequence of the victory of sound
money we started up our Joliet works last
nitfht, which gives employment to 2800

is definitely s ttled."
HAGERSTOWN, Pa., Nov. 4. â The
R. and A. Kuittin -mills in this cit>

BALTIMORE, Md., N>v. s.â Alexander
Brown, bead of the banking-house of Alex

was irodiied with bavins said that not less
than $16,000,000 was simply waiting Mc-
Kinley's election for its investment in
industrial enterprises in Maryland, said
to-day: "Some time ago I stated tbat
$16,000,000 was ready to invest in this State
in the event of McKinley's election. While
I cannot give the details regarding the
transactions involving the money, I can
say that it is available and that it will be
immediately invested in pulpmills, iron
mills, various other manufactories, and in
the promotion and development of the
industrial interests of Baltimore and the
State, and tbat thousands of men will be
benefited thereby. Capital has con
fidence, and its influence toward the re
turn of general prosperity will soon be
felt."
GOLD NO LONGER HOARDED
Bankers Pay Out Yellow Metal
When It Is DÂ°sired.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. s.â Gold was paid
out on demand to-day at all the St. Louis
banks. President Thompson of the Na
tional Bank of Commerce said:
"We have ordered our paying tellers to
pay in gold whenever it is a-ked for. We
did this as the result of the eleci ion of Mc-
Kinley. Before the election we dared not,
as the demand for gold by those who
feared the success of the s.iver m venient
wou;d have exhausted our supply."
President Charles Parsons of the State
Bank, said:
'â¢We are giving out gold now to all who
ask lor it, because we know gold payments
will be kept up by the Government. The
sixty or eighty million dollars of sold
which have been hoarded will come out
and co into circulation, or be det>osited
in banks and all reasonable accommoda
tions will be given to manufacturers and
merchants.
GERMAN BANKERS SPEAK.
They Say That Bus ness I* Already

BERLIN, Germany. Nov. s.â Herr Biei
schroder, the great German bankei, in an
interview on the result of the Presidential
election, expressed tne opinion tbat the
election of McKinley had made a most ex
cellent impression in Germany, but added
that he was unab'e to .oretÂ«ll whether un
toward circumstances woula arise later to
undo tne good lhat has already been done.
Herr Koch, director of the Deutsche
Bank, said :
"The election of McKinley has had the
best possible effect upon the German
bourses and markets. I feel confidint that
McKinley as President, will act differently
from what he did as a committeemau in
Congiess."
Herr Guttman, directoi of the Dresden
Bank, sad:
"The result of the election has made a
splendid impression throughout the com
mercial world and promises for some years
to come stability and quietness, with a
rapid revival of trada and commerce. As
regards the question of protection, even
this must be awaiied calmly."
Director E.sch of the Disconto Bank
said: "The nL hi mare has been removed,
Tne bourses do not expect that McKiniey
will follow as President the same lines
which he pursued as a Congressman."
At the banking-house of Wiliiam Rosen
fceiflÃ & Co. it was said: "We are not
afraid of any high-tariff campaign. The
money that was hoarded through fear
of Bryan's success will now pour into the
market*."
FIRST COME REVENUES.
Senator McMillan Says the Present
Mon^y Is Al Right.
DETROIT, Mich., Not. 6.â James J.
McMillan in an interview to-day said .that
the first tnins; to be done after McKinley
is inaugurated and the new Congress
comes in will be to devise means for in
creasing the revenues and placing the
treasury on a better basis.
Any legislation upon the money of the
country will have to wait upon that. The
only thing to be done is to keep the
money as good as it is now and to formu
late some plan for preventing the periodi
cal outflow of gold. That is really the
weak spot in our present financial system,
w hat Mr. Cailisle has called th â¢ endless
chain. Some scheme to shut that off â the
cancellation of the greenbacks or some
other plan â must be put into operation.
Asked whether he thought the new ad
ministration would make any effort to
brinÃ about the establishment of inter
national bimetallism, Senator McMillan
said:
"No, I do not anticipate anything of the
kind. As I said before, the money we
have now is all right and the system sat
isfactory, except for the occasional drain of
gold, which creates panicky conditions."

COMMENT OF THE PRESS.
Englishmen and Canadians Pleased
With Eryan's Defeat.
L.ONDON, Eno., Nov. s.â The Chronicle
this morning says: "We offer our hearty
congratulations to Major McKinley in so
far as he represents National finance, on
which alone modern credit can be hased,
but the record of the Republican party is
too bad to encourage the hope of much
good resulting from its success. We can
not see the 'eason why the American peo
ple should indulge in rosy prophecies of
prosperity. The future depends upon
conditions little connected with McKin
ley's success."
Ti.e Chronicle will deny that the result
of the campaign is a landslide, and will
say that the surprise is not that Bryan re
ceived so few voles, but rather that he se
cured as many as he did. "It is a somber
reflection," the Chronicle will conclude,
"that anything like a general depression
will range so many citizens upon the side
of wildcat currency schemes and virtual
repudiation and even anarchy."
The Standard will ?ay: "The complete
rejection oi Bryan's tempting programme,
addressed to indolence, incapacity and
cupidity, shows tiiat these qualities are
less wicely distributed in the United
Slates than Bryan wouid have had us be
lieve. There has teen a revolt of the
honest and loyal citizens who are solicit
ous for the fair name and fame of the re
public, and the Bryamtes astonished the
world by the comparative paucity of their
numbers. The hope.essly ignorant and
savaeely covetous wails and strays of
American civilization voted for Bryan, but
Uie bu.k of the soiid sense, business integ
rity and social ability sided with Mc-
Kinley.
"The Nation is to be heartily rongratu
lated. The -ictory has draw bucks for Eng
lishmen, and indeed for every country in
Europe engaged in manufacturing indus
tries. It is a triumph of good faith, but
also a triumph of protection."
TORONTO, Ontario, Nov. s.âComment
ing on the result oi the election in the
United ctates Uie Wor.d says: "McKin
ley's election means a great and almost
immediate rev val in business in ihe Re
public, but McKinieyism will directly or
indirectly antagonize Canada in many
waysâ in the matier of the oonding privi

Sands a Message of Congratulation to
President-Elect William Me-
Kinley of Ohio.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 5. â Chairman
Jones formally conceded the defeat of
William J. Bryan to-night and made his
last Presidential campaign statement to
the public. The silver standard was really
lowered last night so far as the election of
1896 is concerned when advices were re
ceived at headquarters from West Virginia
conceding the electoral vote of that State
to McKinley, but it was decided not to
make a public announcement of the lact
until to-day.
In the mean time Governor Stone arrived
in Chicago from Missouri, in response to
Senator Jones' telegram. The National
Committee chairman, the Governor and
Campaign Chairman Campau were in con
ference this evening in the Senator's room,
and at its conclusion the following state
ment was given to the press:
"The result of the Presidential election
is apparently no longer in aoubi. It has
been one of the closest contests that the
people have been called on to determine
in recent years. We have claimed the
election on our advices from States that
were admittedly in doubt, in which we
knew tnere had been many frauds, and
from which there were evidences of tam
pering with the returns.
"It seems now to be apparent tbat while
Mr. Bryan, alter making the most brilliant
campaign in the history of our country,
lias carried most of the States claimed to
be doubtful, he has not carrier" enough to
~Â«cure his success in the electoral college.
Bryan's electors have been chosen in all
the States south of the Potomac and
Ohio except West Virginia and all those
west of the Missouri except California and
Oregon. He has 190 electoral votes, and
this number may' be increased by final
returns from States yet in question.
"Thus the remarKable campaign closes
with the election of William McKinley,
The result was brought about by every
kind of coercion and intimidation on tne
part of the money power, including threats
of lockouts and dismissals and impending
starvation; by the employment of by far
the largest campaign fund ever used in
this country and by the subordination of
a large per cent of the American press.
The President-elect and his party are
under pledge to the American people to
continue the cold standard and by its
operation to , restore prosperity to this
country.
"As chief executive Mr. Kin lev will
have the cordial support of the millions
of patriotic Americans who have cast
their votes for William Jennings Bryan.
They bow to the majesty of. the office and
abide by the result with none of the tnut
terings that would have come from the
money power had it been unsuccessful.
They are confident the gold standard can
not give the promised prosperity, but
will gladly welcome it if it comes. They
will continue the great struggle for the
uplifting of humanity and to the main
tenance of the dignity of our country in
the establishment of an American mone
tary system. And the Democratic party,
aided by its present allies, wilt still uplift
the bimetallic standard and, bear it on to
victory. . James K. jonxs,
Chairman Democratic National Com*
mittee."
Senator Jones and his family, excepting
his son Kimbrousjh, will leave for their
Arkansas home to-morrow morning, his
son remaining to wind up the 7 affairs of
headquarters. National Corhmitteemen
Johnson, Walsh and Campau will depart
for their homes by the end of the j week,
when there will be nothing' left but a
memory of both Republican and Demo
cratic headquarters. ,

ceded the election of McKinley was given
to Mr. Bryan at 8 o'clock this evening,
throush the medium of a United Asso
ciated Presses bulletin. Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan were ou; walking when the bulletin
was received. They had been in doors all
day, and after supper decided to take a
little needed exercise. Just as the clock:
in the library of the Democratic candi
date's cosy little home was striking he
hour husband and wife returned. Mr.
I Talbot, Mr. Bryan'* law x artner, who h&t
just been elected to the Nebraska Legisla
ture on the Republican ticket, and several
newspaper men were in the library at the
time. Mr. Bryan read the bulletin with
out showing any signs of feeling, and re
marked as he finis >ed: "I'll wait to hear
from Senator Jones before saying any
thing."
Then he put on a velvet nouse jacket
and began chatting pleasantly with some
personal friends who were with him in
the parlor. There was nothing of the pa
thetic in the scene. Mr. Bryan bad not
clung to the hopes held out to him by
some of his enthusiastic followers and
was prepared for the news. His wife, too,
knew that nothing encouraging was to be2
expected. Her natural eood nature came
to tne fore when she realized that the
strain was over, and she laughed and joked
with those about her while Mr. Bryan also
chaffed the newspaper men during the
wait lor the official message from Senator
Jones. Half an hour later a telegraph
messenger banded a dispatch to the de
feated candidate.
"You may say," said he, torning lo the
newspaper men after reading the telegram,
"that the election of McKinley is con
ceded, and I will issue a statement to
night."
Then he sat down at the big oak desk at
which he works and began writing a mes
sage of congratulation to his victorious
opponent, Mrs. Bryan leaning over bis
shoulder as his pencil went over the paper.
This was the message:
Hon. William McKinley, Canton, Ohio: Senator
Jones has just Informed me that the returns
indicate your election, and I bastcn to extend
my congratulations. We have submitted the
Issues to the American people and their will
Is law. William J. Bryan.
Mr. Bryan paused once during the
writing to tell a humorous story apropos
of a remark made by one of those about
him. Wtien he had finished, he handed
the dispatch to a messenger. Mr. Bryan
then told another story. There appeared
to be nothing forced about tbe pieasant
manner of the youne political leader. He
seemed actually happy that the strain was
over. He told the representative of tbe
United Associated Presses in tha conver
sation that ensued that to-night he would
prepare a statement to be issued to the
bimetallists of the country, aod would
make it public before noon to-morrow,
and not this evening, as he had previously
said.
Mr. Bryan said he did not C3re to say
anything about the result K>f the election
to-night, bnt in response to a question as
to whether he thought McKinley's election
was a blow to the cause of bimetallism, ho
responded: "The fight has just com
menced."
SEE VICTORY IN DEFEAT.
Popocrats Yet Hopeful for Free
Stiver Coinage.
CHICAGO. 111., Nov. s.â Chairman
Washburn closed the Chicago headquart
ers of the People's party National Com
mittee to-nuht and will depart for bis
home in Boston to-morrow morning. In
about ten days he will go to Washington
to confer with Senators Jones and Butler
in regard to the, future policy of the allied
silver forces. In this connection Mr.
Washburn said to a reporter for tbe United
Associated Presses:
"As a result of the present campaign we
find victory in defeat. The lact that so
much was accomplished in so short a
time with tbe limited means inspires the
belief that we can win four years hence.
We were confronted with a united army
and an unparalleled camraign fund, while
our own forces were divided, with secret
foes in cur midst as well as fusion difficul
ties and the amalgamation of opposing
forces to contend with. Mr. Bryan made
the greatest campaign recorded in political
history and stands unrivaled as a leader.
Revolutions never go backward and the
momentum of this campaign will be con
tinued by the allied silver forces.
"I believe this election will result in
separating the gold chaff from the bilver
wheat and force the traitors in the silver
ranks to unite with the Republicans,
â where they belone. It is worth all our
pfTort to shake of* these barnacles and
Btart afresh wilh renewed hope. In order
that all the elements constitutine the move
ment â the silver .Republicans, silver Dem
ocrats and Populistsâ may be satisfied, it
may become necessary to merge all these
"forces into one great army under a new
name. It is rarely that a new creat issue
succeeds under an old party name.
'â¢We begin the Congressional fight of
1898 and the Presidential fight of 1900
to-morrow. We shall have a conference
of our National leaders within a short
time, when the plans^of the contest and
the policy of tbe future may be determ
ined upon. Let no one believe that 6ilver
JB defeated. Tde movement is simply
uurified and regenerated. In a new form,
â with new hope and vigor and with the
pold-bug traitors eliminated from the
movement, we emerge from this contest
stronger tban ever to march forward to
the victory which awaits us."
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 5 âSenator Teller
of Colorado left for home yesterday. Be
fore going he said: "Tuesday's election
Bettles the fact that fully half the States
are for silver, and I would not be sur
prised if it should still turn out that Bryan
is elected. Whatever the result, however,
the silver question will continue to be an
issue. The people have never be
fore understood the silver issue.
This campaign of education has
been of great benefit to the silver cause.
A foitnigut longer and there wou.d have
been no question about the result. No,
sir; silver is not a dead issue."
In regard to the fusion question Senator
Teilcr said he had nothing to say.
MILWAUKEE, "Wis., Nov. 5.â E. C. j
Wall, the SiivÂ«?r Nat onal Committeeir.an,
last night gave out a long interview on ;
the result. He said: "I do not believe !
that this election will settle the question
of bimetallism. The Democratic party is !
now committed to that doctrine and will
stand by it. ' There will henceforth be but
two great parties in this country, one for
free silver coinage and the other against
it. The next campaign will be fought on
the same lines, and the fight will continue
until the advocates of a restoration of
ailver to its coinage rights win the battle.
I would not be surprised if the fusion of
Democrats and Populists should become
permanent, since there is a common
ground of doctrine on which the parties
may remain united. The intercourse we
nave had with the Populists in tnis cam
paign has been very pleasant. We have
found them sincere and enthusiastic"
HELENA, Mont.. Nov. s.â Discussing
tbe result, Senator Carter said:
"The election of McKinley bids the
American people renew hope in the future.
Thai the newly elected President will
justify the expectations of the people no
one famiiiar with bis past record and
great ability can question. It must be
understood, however, that bis path is lia
ble to be beset with difficulties-. It is ob
vious the Senate will be very close on the
subject of tariff legislation. The very
large vote for Bryan will admonish those
in authority of the necessiiy for prompt
and vigorous efforts in the direction of
securing results on tbe coinage question
in accordance with the party platform.
LONDON, Eso., Nov. s.â The Bimetallic
League of Great Britain is about to issue a
proclamation setting forth that tbe elec
tion of McKinley is a victory for interna
tional bimetallism, quoting in support of
this contention from tbe monetary plank
adopted by the Republican convention
held at St. Louis, concluding with a pledge
to promote an international agreement tor
a bimetallic standard among the commer
cial nations of the world.
SENATOR PALMER'S VIEW.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Nov. s.â Benator
John M. Paimer last evening made the
following statement regarding toe result
of the election:
â¢'The Democrats who voted for Bryan
at this election did so with the knowledge
that he accepted tbe Populist platform ot
1892, as well as their platform adopted in
St. Louis in 1896. The National Democ
racy will never seek an alliance with tbe
Populists. I predict that Mr. Bryan, who
voted for Weaver in 1892, will soon aban
don tbe Democratic name. His candi
dacy, which was an example of unreason
ing socialism, was exploded by the elec
tion of McKinley at the late election. Tbe
issues of the canvass were dictated to the
Chicago convention by a combination of
politicians who were without principle
and only sought succes-.
"Bryan, thanks to the good sense and
integrity of the American people, is de
feated. Democrats know that protection,
as the Republicans calls it, is a fallacy,
but they also know that the unlimited
coinage of silver on the ratio of 16 to 1 will
deprave tbe American monetary system
and produce infinite mischief. They have
accepted the lesser of the two evils. I ap
prove of their conduct, and thank the
Democrats who have voted aeainst Bryan
and Altgeld, who are the representatives
of a depraved currency and social dis
order."
KENTUCKY.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. s.â Both sides
continue to c.'aim Kentucky; the Repub
licans give figures, but Secretary Richard
son of the Democratic committee declines
to give out any information in the posses
sion of his committee, exceDt to make the
statement that Bryan has carried the
State. Chairman Roberts of the Repub
lican committee said at 8 o'clock to-niaht:
"McKinley has carried Kentucky by at
least 800, and they cannot count us out.
We depend on the Eleventh District to
overcome the plurality in eicht districts.
We expect at least 14,000 plurality in the
Eleventh. This will give us 400 plurality
in the State, and I expect it to Â«o to 600.
Tbe Democratic pluralities from Western
Kentucky are almost exactly the same as
Chairman fcommer- 1 estimates, and this
looks as if bis managers there gave him
just what he asked for."
In a telegram to Canton Mr. Roberts
said:
"Democrats are howling that we are
counting them out In the mountains.
This is to hide the absurdly lame Bryan
majorities in Owen, Graves, Union and a
dozen other counties."
The Evening Times gives the State to
McKinley by 478 plurality. It will lake
the official count to decide the result.
Information was given out at Republi
can headquarters that Colonel W. C. P.
â¢Breckinridgr- will certainly contest the
election of Evan Settle, free-silver Demo
crat, as Congressman from the Seventh
District on the ground of fraud. Colonel
Breckinridge has sent two attorneys to
Owen Couuty to witness the official
count.
Tne fight for Kentucky's electoral vote
prows warmer every minute. The Demo
crats are trying to tÂ»;row out, two large
Republican precincts in Christian and
McCracken counties on the ground of
irr eularitie* in registration.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Nov. s. âThe chances
are that there will be a contest over the
Seventh District, whare Coionei Breckin
ridse was de'.eated. Many lawyers are of
the opinion that holding primaries for
county officers to be elected a year hence
in Owen County on the same day that the
general election was held (Tuesday)
dearly invalidates the vote of Owen
County, and it may be asked that the
county's vote be thrown out. Tbi* will be
in Breckinridge'a favor.
It develops that no election officers were
appointed in lireathitt County until on
the morning of the election, and that
only silver men were put in. The Demo
cratic majority is 150 more than aver be
fore, when the neighboring counties
showed smaller majorities. In Owen
County a primary election was held for
county otticers in violation of the law.
The throwing out of these two counties
â¢would make McKimey's majority 4000.
NORTH CAROLINA.
RALEIGH, N. C, Nov. s.â Bryan car
ries North Carolina oy 15,fi00, is the official
statement made at Democratic State bead
quarters. The Republican State chairman
concedes his victory, but declares his ma
jority is only 6000. The Republican State
chairman announces the following as Con
gressional majorities: irkinner P. 2000,
White (colored) R. 3000. Fowler P. 25U0,
Stoud P. 3200. Kitchen D, 340, Martin P.
nearly 2000. Sl.uford P. 400. Linne R. 2600,
Pearson K. 1400. He also says that Rus
sell, R., is ejected Governor by U.OGO
plurality.
Republican Chairman Holton taid at
11:30 o'clocu: "I concede that Bryan gets
12 000 mijority in North Carolina. We
lack only about eleven of having enough
members of the Legislature to elect a Sen
ator on a straight fight. The Populiats
will co-operate with us to elect a Republi
can Senator."
A Republican committeeman says the
Republicans have endeavored to aid in
the election of Populists friendly to the
re-election of Senator PritcharJ. It ap
pears that the latter will be elected,
thoueh the Populists really hold the bal
ance of power and can name the Senator
if they shouia desire to do so. A Populist
State committeeman says the Populists
will nominate a silver man for Senator.
The Democratic estimate of the Legisla
ture is 57 Republicans, 47 Populists and 44
Democrats, with 18 seats in doubt. Most
of the latter, it is thought, will be either
Populist or Republican.
TENNESSEE.
MEMPHIS, Tksn., Nov. B.â Each side
is waiting for the other to niaki returns
from Tuesday's election. The margin be
tween tne two parties in the guberna
nutorial race is certainly very close and
both are thus far warranted in adhering
to the claim of victory on the State ticket.
The missing Democratic counties are in
West Tennessee, the Republicans in the
eastern division, and both are more or
less inaccessible so far as communication
facilities are concerned. One third of the
counties are still out, and ihey are about
equally divided in the majority of their
resp ctive sides. Owing to peculiar c n
ditions estimates are unreliable, and the
only thine todo is to wait for the actual
n.ures.
At 9:30 o'clock to-night the returns in
give the Republicans a lead of about 3000.
Democratic managers claim the State by
10.000.
Reliable returns (official) and reports
received by the Nashville Sun from eighty
nine out of ninety-six counties in Ten
nessee, with conservative estimates on re
maining counties, give Taylor (D.) for
Governor 7590 majority over Tillman (R.).
The Bryan ticket will lead the State Demo
cratic ticket by from 5000 to 10,000.
NORTH DAKOTA.
BISMARCK, N. D. t Nov. 6.â Returns
are coming in so slowly that it is difficult
to form any intelligent estimate on the
Legislature. Very little is known yet ex
cept as to the electoral ticket, Governor
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1896.
and Congressman, but there is every indi
cation that tbe Republicans will have both
the Senate and Hov e by a small majority.
In the Senate the Republicans have elected
all bnt a fsw Senators who bold over.
Friends of Senator Hansbrough claim he
has a majority of the Republicans thus
far known to be elected. In the three dis
tricts of Grand Forks County all the Re
publican Legislative nominees were Hans
brough men, and two are elected.
Johnsou for Congress is running behind
the Republican ticket. The fusionists
claim Johnson's defeat by Burke, and
there is some betting on the result. Re
ports from Grand Forks, Burleieh, Traille,
Morton and Lamoure counties show that
the entire Republican Legislative ticket is
elected. McKinley has now 3800 majority.
SOUTH DAKOTA.
PIERRE, 8. D., Nov. s.â Both Demo
crats, and Republicans are much excited
to-night over the closeness of the returns,
and charges and counter charges of fraud
are freely made. At Fort Pierre a num
ber of arrests were made this afternoon
for illegal voting and twenty more will
follow to-morrow. The situation is one of
extreme tension. It is now conceded by
both sides that whichever way the elec
tion goes the plurality will not be over 600
or 700. The Republicans are gaining
sik'htlv, and assurances are repeated that
McKinley will get the State by a small
ninjonty. The Legislature will be Popu
list by twelve to fifteen. The returns are
not yet in from fifteen counties. McKin
ley has a lead of 650. Populist Chairman
Boules claims the State for Bryan by 500.
Republican Chairman Elliott claims it for
McKinley by 700.
Snowstorms in the western part of the
State make reports slow. The railroad
and mining vote went solidly for Bryan.
Congressman Pickler announces his
withdrawal from the S natorial contest.
Congressman Gamble thinks he is elected.
Senator Pettigrew has advised Populists
through the State that tbe State is theirs
and that the RepuDiicans will attempt to
steal it.
OHIO.
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Nov. s.â The elec
tion in tbis Congressional district, the
Twelfth, is very close and will probably
result In a contest in the House. The
official returns give Lentz D. 54 plurality,
but mistakes involving more than that
number of votes have been discovered here
and in Fairfield Count}', which are being
closely pressed by the candidates' attor
neys as ground for throwing out precincts.
Brenner D. has a plurality of 120 by tbe
unofficial returns in the Third District.
A contest may result there. The Demo
crats have carrie. t four districts beyond
question, viz., the Fourth, Fiith, Thir
teenth and Seventeenth. Tne Republi
cans have the other fifteen districts.
INDIANA.
INDIANAPOLIS, Inp., Nov. s.âlnrfi
ana complete, with the returns of thirty
six counties taken from tbe official count
and the rest unofficial, gives the State to
McKinley by 22,145. The Republican

pluralities and <!<-> not mention the Palmer
vote, but it iÂ» not thought it will run over
The c llicial count givss the Ninth

four Democrats and nine Republicans.
The Republicans have a majority of 20 in
the Senate and 6 in the House.

and 63 Republicans on joint ballot.
NEW MEXICO.
SANTA FE, N. Mex., Nov. s.â Returns

turns from all of the 102 counties in Il
linois, including Cook, give McKinley a
plurality of 144,131 and Tanner a plurality
of 115,504. Complete cffk-ial returns may

STATUS OF THE SENATE.
There Will Be Thirty- Eisrht Gold
and Ten Silver Republicans.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. s.â The status
of tbe United States Senate after the
4tb of March next is still a matter of
doubt. Present indication^ however, are
that the Republicans will be compelled to
seek recruits from those of their number
who joined the free silver forces last
spring or an alliance with sound-money
Democrats to accomplish legislation affect
ing either financial or tariff questions.
Tbe Senate in the Fifty-fifth Congiess
probably will be composed of the follow

NEW POLICIES AHEAD.
As President, Major McKinley
Will Protect Americans.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. s.â ln its
bearing on tne international relations of
(he United States McKinley's election is
considered important as insuring a sta
bility of policy hardly to be looked for in
ca-e men new in questions of foreign
affairs had been swept into executive
cower. The public men who will natur
ally be in the front rank of tbe forthcom
ing administration are known quantities,
and there is general confidence mat their
attitude to the rest of tbe world will not
essentially diverge from the long estab
lished course of those who have been most
prominent in McKinley's support, and
who are therefore relied upon to be his
closest advisers.
The most marked departure anticipated
from President Cleveland's external pol
icy relates to Hawaii. A prompt return
to President Harrison's plan of annexa
tion is expected in accord witn nis treaty,
which President Cleveland's first official |
action after inauguration was to withdraw j
from the Senate four years ago.
Not the slightest doubt exists that the
next Secretary of State will be in complete
harmony with President Harrison in this
matter, as McKinley was well known to
have been. The only other reversal of
policy iooked for is that whicn must re
sult from tbe customs tariff revision de
manded by the imperative necessity of in
creasing the revenue immediately after
the 4th of March.
The reciprocity arrangements abrogated
without warning by the Wilson-Gorman
bill are regarded as sure of resuscitation
at the earliest possible moment, and it is
not thought now a change in sugar duties
in accordance with Mr. McKinley's well
known views could be affected without
sweeping away the friction existing be
tween this country and Germany, Austria
and other beet sugar exporting countries,
growing out of the unequal bounty sys
tems and discriminating duties.
In the Turkish and Cuban affairs no
change whatever is likely to occur. The
issues involved in Turkey have been prac
tically unaltered for thirty years and all
precedents now being followed are those
of McKinley's long line of predecessors.
Shou d the Cuban complication continue
until March it is well understood that the
United States will preserve its strict neu
trality, as was done when Grant was in the
Wuite House.
The first practical step in Jthe Vene
zuelan controversy having already been
accomplished there would be no wonder if
it were entirely settled at any moment as
far as diplomacy goes. This was the sin
gle great advance of the present adminis
tration after many fruitless efforts, and its
successor may have only to insist upon
the execution of an exhaustive agreement
lor arbitration.
MERCHANTS ARE JUBILANT
Satisfaction Expressed In Gotham's
Chamber of Commerce.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. s.â The regu
lar monthly meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce, held at noon to-day, partook
of the nature of a jubilee meeting over the
success ot sound money. The president's
desk and the pillars on both sides were
draped with National flags. There was a
full attendance of members and as Presi
dent A. E. Orr rose to cali the meeting to
order he was greeted with applause.
Secretary Wilson and Henry Hintz,
chairman of the social committee on
sound financial legislation, adore sed the
members of the chamber, congratulating
them vi on the buccess of the sound
money candidates, and submitted a report
of tne rommittee reviewing the work
done by it in tbe interest of sound money.
Tne report thanks the newspapers and
business throughout the country for their
co-operation in the advocacy of sound
money.
In his address President Orr congratu
lated his hearers on tbe result of the elec
tion. He declared it was not the work of
any parly, but the patriotic work of men
of all parties. He said that they had
united in opposing a crafty and treacher
ous foe, who, he said, "paving gathered
together the disorganizing, the disturbing
and the dissatisfied elements In the land,
sought to overthrow the most magnificent
system of lrce constitutional government
the world has ever known."
THOSE "CRUEL FAKES."
Inaccurate Election Bulletins Sent
by the Chicago Press Concsrn.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Nov. s.â The
News says editorially : The Chicago As
sociat d Press is either dishonest or is
controlled by an iridescent dreamer who
thinks dishonest election returns can be
palmed off upon honest and honorable
newspapers. The utter worthlessness of
the Chicago Associated Press was never
more clearly demonstrated than it was by
its bogus election bulletins, in which it
stirred up a confiding public. It at
tempted to hoodoo the News with its
bosh, bnt tbe News telegraph editor saw
the little game and consigned the "spe
cial" to the waste basket. The United
Associated Presses furni hed the only re
liable report received in Springfield. The
News is prou !er to-day of the United As
sociated I're&sps than vt.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. s.â The
Sun, under- the caption "Cruel Fakea,"
editorially says to-day: Tbe bulletins
posted yesterday afternoon by the Sentinel
and News were fakes, no matter if they
were furnished by the notorious Chicago
Associated Press. These bulletins con
veyed the impression to the public that
Brvan might be elected. The result was
the wildest excitement through tbe c-ty
and great damage to business. The only
unreliable and unwarranted bulletins in
duced men to wager their money on tbe
result and these who bet on Bryan, and
there were many of them, if allieports
are true, lost heavily.
At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon enough
was known of the electoral vote to war
rant the positive announcement that
Bryan had been defeated. Taese facts
the Sun, with the aid of the alwaysac
curate and reliable reports of tbe United
Associated Presses, was able to publish in
its columns and also announce through
its bulletins. In the future the public
will no doubt view with mistrust the an
nouncements of these papers and their
unreliable news service aud naturally
turn to the Sun and tbe United Associated
Presses, both of which are honest enough
to deal only in facts.
FAULKNER'S LAST WAIL.
Follows Senator Jones In Giving
Up the Ghost.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 6.âChair
man Faulkner of the Democratic Con
gressional committee to-night gave ont
the following: Chairman Jones informed
me that he will concede the election of
McKinley.
The confidence which Senator Jones has
inspired and the manner in which he has
conducted the campalen will warrant me
iv saying that none will question the pro
priety of his acting promptly in so grave
a matter when once he had become thor
oughly satisfkd from the returns in his
possession that there remains no further
hope for the success of the magnificent
leader whose plume has been seen in
the front of the line of battle in
thirty States and whose eloquent voice in
behalf of tbe people's cause has inspired
millions of his fellow-citizens to strain
every effort within the lines of legitimate
controversy to secure a^ victory which
would relieve them from the merciless
exactions of a continued contracting cur
rency. The National Democracy has been
defeated, but from returns in our posses
sion, and which we believe will be shown
in the electoral colle -c, twenty-six States,
with 200 c ectoral votes, have indorsed its
candidates and approved its platform. .
WINTER IN MIDDLE STATUS.
Chicago Weather Sharps Predict the Jp
pruaeh of a General Htizz ird.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. s.â The weather
sharps of Chicago predict a genuine bliz
zard is approaching this city. Last mid
night a snowstorm developed, coming
from the south. To-morrow another storm
is due from the West. The snow to-day
was soft and tne streets became seas of
mud and slush. A drop of fully ten de
grees is expected to take place to-night
and the first winter weather of the season
is expected to be experienced by Chi
cagoaus to-morrow.
Cuban Agent 111 and Violent.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 5.â A. D. Powers,
the former Cuban relief agent of Chicago,
is still at his father's home at Owensboro,
Ky. His mind is clear on some points,
but his general conversation is incoherent.
The Chicago detectives who are at work
on the case believe that Powers was held
up and robbed while crossing a bridge in
Chicago and that bis mind has been af
fected by a blow. Powers is unable to
tell of any assault. He grows violent at
times and the presence of an attendant is
at ail times necessary.
Strike of Pork JButchere.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 5.â A1l the pork
butchers at the packing-houses in this
city are on strike, caused by the failure to
advance their wages, as is customary for
tbe winter season. During the summer,
wages are $1 a day less than in winter, the
change taking place usually in October.
On the plea of hard times and the ap
proaching election, the data of change wan
postponed until November 4. Yesterday
the men were notified that only 75 ceius
additional would be allowed, and they
struck.

SAM RAINEY EXPLAINS,
Tells Why Bryan Was
Not Supported in San
Francisco.
Indifference Seems to Have Been
the Bane of the Demo
cratic Party.
Sam Rainey, the sage of the Warm
Springs, Is a pictureique character in San
Francisco politics, and he is never more
interesting than when he is talking to
newspaper reporters. It is one of his
theories that a statesman 1 ought not to bo
interviewed, but his practice does not al
ways conform to this theory.
Mr. Rainey gives a novel reason for the
defeat of Bryan in tbis City. He says it
was due entirely to indifference among
members of the Democratic party, and
points to the fact that over 9000 registered
voters neglected to go to tbe polls. Of
these Registrar Hinton estimates that
there are about 1000 sailora who->e homes
are in this City, but who are absent on tne
rolling deep. If you allow 1000 more for
the class of nomads, who have no fixed
abode and who were not nere long enougu
to get in their votes, there are still about
7000 qualified voters who did not care to
confront tiie somewhat difficult task of
making out an Australian ballot.
"I found it h;.rd to make up my mina
whether to vote for Bryan or McKm.t-y,"
said Mr. Rainey to a Call reporter, "'ihe
day before election a lady friend of miiiM
spoke to me on the subject, and when I
told her of my state of mind she could
hardly believe me, but I assured her that
I was in earnest. I don't mind telling
you that I had uot decided what to do In
regard to the Presidential ticket even J
after I got my ticket from the ballot clerk^
and went into the booth. I made out my
ticket for Congressman an'i the Legisla
ture and was about to leave tne Presi
dential choice, but at the last moment I
tnought 1 niigp.t as well let it all go to
gether, and so gave my vote to Uryan.
"Now this illustrates what I was saying.
If a man like myself could feel so doubt
ful and indifferent on this point, there
must have been thousands of other Demo
crats who were in a similar frame of
mind. That's how the Republican* camo
to carry San Francisco for McKinley."
Mr. Rainey seemed to think it was a
good thing to have a majority of tne
Board of Supervisors Democratic. Thirty
minutes after the polls closed he predicted
that the Democrats would have nino
members of the board.
The partial success of the Democratic
municipal ticket has given some comfort to
those in high Democratic councils who are
depressed on account of the dark outlook
in the National field, yet they are notable
to understand why so many voters who
evidently suuported the Democratic local
ticket voted for the champion of souml
money and protection. There is a general
impression that the Examiner's wild-eyed
articles drove many Democrats from
Bryan, and it is a settled fact that the
Chronicle is in a great part responsible
for turning so much of the municipal
I government over to the Democrats. In
! political circles the explanation of Mr.
j Rainey is not generally accepted, though
i it possibly has some foundation in regard
j to National politics.
There is a well-defined opinion that
Governor-elect Smith of Montana was cor-
I rect when he declared that the laboring
ciasses of San Francisco had loyally sup
ported McKinley, and that the returns
bear him out in that position.
Several of the loc.il contests were so bit
ter that men were willing to trade off the
entire National, Congressional and legisla
tive ticket for an insignificant City orÂ£ce,
and it is thought tbut these contracts for
the trading of votes were, as a general
th.ng, carried out according to the condi
tions agreed on.

That Threatens an American

HAVANA, Ctjba, Nov. 5. â Information
has been received here of the capture of
tbe town of Quaimaro, in the province of
Puerto Principe, by the rebels, who have
besieged the place since October 10, mak
ing a number of attacks upon the town and
its stronghold, Fort Ileus, in the mean
time. The Spanish in the course of the
fighting in defense of the place had eight
men killed and lour officers, including a
major, and eighteen privates wounded.
The fort and the town were captured by
the insurgents on October 28, and it is said
that the garrison was obliged to surrender
owing to tbeir lack of officers.
General GonzalesMunoz reports that his
command has had an engagement with
tne rebels under Perico Delgado and Diaz
at Manelito, near Cabanas, province of
Pinar del Rio.
The rebels held strong positions in tbe
hills.but were dislodged after several com
bats in wnich General lnclan assisted Gen
eral Munoz. The troops captured a num
ber of cattle. The losses of the rebels are
not given but are believed to have been
heavy. The Spaniards lost two killed and
a captain, lieutenant and twenty-two pri
vates wounded.
In the case of Luis Someillan, an Amer
ican citizen, who is charged with rebellion,
the Attorney-General to-day asked that he
be sentenced to life imprisonment in
chains. The representatives of tbe Amer
ican Government will appeal against such
a sentence.
It is rumored that Maceo was seriously
injured in his last engagement with the
Spanish troop?, but the rumor finds no
credence among the Cubans here.
A PLUCKJ YANKKE SKIPPER.
Refused to Surrender a Passenger on
Heyler's Demand.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. sâ Captain
Mclntosii of the steamer Vigilancia,
which arrived to-day, reluctantly told the
atory of General Weyler's attempt to take
a passenger from his vessel and having
failed to do so.
He said that no threat that be knew of
was made to fire upon his craft unless he
gave the man up. The passenger, he
naid, was Antonio Kscalante. who boarded
tbe vessel at this city and was bound for
Vera Cruz. Tbe man claimed to be an
American citizen.
When at Havana the Chief of Police of
that city came aboard and said that Gen
eral Weyler had received a letter from
this city (New York) that Escalante was
a Spanish subject and was on his way to
Mexico to escape military duty, and on
tbe strength of that communication Gen
eral Weyler demanded the surrender of
tbe man.
Captain Mclntosh told the Chief of
Police that unless Consul-General Lee
consented to tbe man's surrender he
would not give him up without a light.
His vessel was then lying in Havana har
bor. He was advised that General Lee
had refused to surrender the man and he
was not molested a^ain.
McKINLEY'S Â« VltA.\ POLICY.
Bavana Papers .-ire Pleated Over the
Major* Election.
NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 5.â A special
cable to the Herald from Havana says:
The evening dailies editorially commend
McKinley's election. In relation to the
new President's future policy, La Lucha
says:
Major McKiniey 6f the State of Ohio is I
a superior man, and too intelligant to !
launch himself in adventures of any sort ;
which might compromise himself, al
though indirectly for the Nation's inter- !
ests; nor is it conceivable or probable that, i
not heeding political questions at home, '
McKiniey will embrace the political ideas j
of other people.
The correspondent of the Hcraldo of j
Madrid Uas interviewed the secretary of !
ih-. local treasury. That official stated
that the army was pad up to dat-. He be- j
l.eyed that the tariff re.'orms would be en- j
forced at once, increasing the duties
on Spanish products, which would
raise the taxes 10 per cent more;
stamped paper would be 50 per cent.
He said tiiat the insurgents had ob- I
tamed great resources by levying a tax
of 2 per cent on sugar estates, 50 cent? on
a bag of sugar, $4 lor each head of cattle
introduced into the towns and 53 cents for |
every four pounds or tobacco curried from
the field.

A TARY'S LONDON SHACK.
Property Vicned by Lady Henry Somer
set Condemned and Dilapidated.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. s.â Lady Henry
Somerset has once again come into public
notice as the owner of a tract of -.round at
Somerstown, a neighborhood within the
limits of London, and which is 'covered
with old dilapidated dwellings. Tbe
authorities have officially declared the
region a "condemned insanitary area,"
but there appears to be no law under
which the structures can be razed or the
tenants compelled to seek other quarters.
Tbe place lias come into notice from the
fact that five inquests have been held
within the last month upon people who
have died suddenly or from accident with
in the area.

Hoarded Yellow Metal Taken From
Private Vaults and Exchanged
for Sound Currency.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. s.â More
gold is pouring into several of the sub
treasury offices than the offices have
storage capacity for or have legal tender
currency to give in exchange. This is
notably tne case in Boston. This gold has
been brought out of safe-deposit vaults by
the owners, who have been paying storage
charges upon it. Baltimore and New
York also had large deposits of gold, but
how much was deposited at New York
could not be stated at the treasury, as the
usual da;ly telegram had not been received
wnen the department closed. Nothing
had been heard from Western points. In
respect to gold deposits the treasury sent
out this letter to-day to the nine assistant
treasurers:

a Pardon, Full and
Unconditional.
She Is Pleased and May B:
Given an Allowance by
the Republic.
KILAUEA IN VIOLENT ACTION.
Pardm for Portuguese Rioters Re
fused â Minister Cooper En Route
to the United States.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Oct. 29.â 1n a
meeting on the 23d inst. of the Council of
State with the executive it was voted
unanimously to extend full pardon to the
ex-Queen Liliuokalani. The proceedings
were as follows:
President Dole said the Minister of For
eign Affairs had another matter to bring
up.
Minister Cooper â On account of the up
rising in January, 1895, a number of Ha
waiians and others .were brought before a
military commission, tried, convicted and
sentenced. Among the number was Liliu
okalani, the ex-Queen, who was sentenced
to five years' imprisonment and to pay a
fine of $5000. She was confined to the ex
ecutive building until September 9 of the
same year, when the Government saw tit
to release her, ana she returned to her
home at Washington place. The conditions
of this release were that she would permit
no assemblages at Washington place, and
should have not more than thirteen
male and eight female retainers at a time.
In February last the privileges were ex
tended to permission to visit anywhere on
Oahu. but not to leave the island without
Government sanction. All these condi
tions, I am able to report, have been faith
fully followed, and the prisoner has shown
herself in every way obedient to the new
order. The executive, after carefully con
sidering the matter, unanimously decided
to grant Liliuokalani full pardon and com
plete restoration of civil rights. We ask
your approval of thiÃ course.
Minister Damon â 1 second what tne
Minister has said. 1 feel that it voices the
sentiments of the executive, the Council
| and the people. The past is history.
I With its mistakes and its good deeds it is
I gone. A new era of greater prosperity and
entire harmony is opening before us. Let
us do all we can to make this one country,
one people and let the past be forgotten.
Councilor Brown â I move that we adopt
I the recomiaendation of the executive.
Councilor Enaâ Mr. President, I tak*
great pleasure in offering a second to the
motion.
The motion prevailed by a unanimous
vote, whereupon the meeting adjourned.
The ex-Queen was at her WaiJtiki cot
tage, and it was not until the 27. h thai
the President's aid. Major Potter, was
able to visit her and convey the document
following:
I, Sanford B. Dole, President of the Republic
ol the Hawaiian Islands, moved by just
causes made known to me and being thereto
nd vised by the Cabinet ami Council of State,
do hereby, in accordance with the power lv
me vested, grant unto Liliuokalaui, who was
found guiUy of the crime of misprison of
treason by a military commission duly con
vened, and sentenced to imprisonment at
nurd labor lor the term of five years, to date
from the 9th day of February, A. D. 1895, and
to pay a fine of $500 Q. which sentence was ap
proved by the commander-in-cbief, and which
sentence was subsequently modified, a full
and free pardon and restoration to her civil
rights.
In witness whereof I have hereunto act my
hand and caused the great seal of the Repub
lic of Hawaii to be affixed, at the executive
building in Honolulu, this 23d day ot Octo
ber, A. D. 1896.
This document was signed by the Presi
dent and the four Ministers.
Major Potter said: 'It gives me,
madam, very great pleasure to hand you
this paper."
Liliuokalani took the paper, put on her
spectacles and read it carelully through,
bhe then turned to Major Potter with a
smile, saying, "It gives me very great
pleasure, indeed, to receive this."
Potter then retired.
It is believed that the executive would
not be adverse to granting the ex-Queen a
moderate allowance, like that given to
Kaiulani. That will depend upon the
views taken by the Legislature of 1898.
Nothing has been said oi any proposed
pardon of the other persons whb were con
victed on account of the uprising of 1895
The executive will probably deem it cxl
pedient to continue the restrictions UDon
them. r
The Council negatived a number of pe
titions for the pardon of five Portuguese
rioters who were sentenced to thirty days'
imprisonment.

manacer of Gormully <fe Jeflery's bicycle

known in business circles, was shot this
evening at his home, 383 Superior street,
under circumstances suggestive of at

'I lie bullet entered the chest near the

throughout the night in a semi-conscious

physicians that he cannot live. Noone can
explain how or why Mr. Blake shot him
self, and he did not recover consciousness
after the shooting long enough to explain.
His friends wili not admit that he en
deavored to take his life, claiming that
he had no reason to feel discontented, and
that he win a man of cheerful disposition.
They say that the shooting was doubtless
an accident, and that the revolver was
discharged as Mr. Blake was removing
his overcoat.

DEL MONTE, Cal., Nov. s.â Thomas
B. Reed arrived here yesterday on a spe
cial train from San Francisco and is en
joying to the fullest extent the rest and
quiet be has found at this beautiful resort.
His daughter, who has been her father's
companion during his speeebmaking tour
of the United States, accompanied him.
The resc of the party are Senator C. N.
Felton, J. F. Aldrich and wife of Chicago,
James Barney, Major Bates, U. S. A., J. A.
Fillmore and F. S. Douty.
After the visitors had partaken of
luncheon at the hotel they were taken for
a drive through the Del Monte grounds
and the interesting old town of Monterey.
Mr. Reed sat upon the box seat and
thoroughly enjoyed the drive and the
sightseeing. In Monterey he was en
thusiastically cheered us he passed. In
the afternoon a delegation consisting of
the town council of Monterey and a large
number of the leading citizens called upon
him at the hotel. He talked of the issues
of the campaign, of Republicanism in
general and of many subjects of interest
to California. His conversation surprised
them, for be demonstrated that he knew as
much about their own State as did the na
tive Californians.
During the evening ex-Assemblyman 8.
J. Duckworth showed to Mr. Reed a tele
gram received from J. R. Jones, chairman
of the National Democratic Committee,
which was to the effect that Bryan and
Jones would not give up the fight, for
they could not understand how the States
they had counted upon so positively could
have gone for McKiniey. When Mr. Reed
read it. he smiled, and remarked:
"If that were all that our friends Bryan
and Jones did not understand they would
jbe better off. The issues of the campaign
even seem beyond them."
The N.caragua canal qnestion was
touched upon as to the advisability of the
enterprise ana the possibility of its early
commencement afier this election. Mr.
Reed said :
"Well, we had better wait until we get a
little ahead on revenues; then there will
be plenty of time for that scheme."
Ihis morning the party was driven over
the celebrated Seventeen-mile drive, and
both Mr. Reed and his daughter were
greatly impressed with its beauties. As
the coach passed through Monterey and
Pacific Grove, crowds of citizens gathered
on the principal streets and cheered vocif
i erously. Mr. Reed, (rom his seat on the
{ box, bowed and smiled.
Mr. Reed was to-nigbt asked his opin
ion as to whether Tuesday's election had
effectively crushed the fiat money agita
tion, aud whether he believed the Demo
crats would ever again accept fusion
proposals from the Populists.
"Now, I will tell you," said Mr. RÂ°ed,
"I would be glad to tell â and especially
regarding those questions â all about the
outcome, but with the data at hand now
it is indeed a very vague question."
He was asked as regards the result of
the election, if it was as he expected it
would b>\
"Yes," said Mr. Reed, "the general re
sult is as I expected. I was not surprised
at the vote cast by the several States, but
1 will say 1 was particularly pleased with
the result in California. Maryland was
gratifying, too. The yet doubtful States
will, I believe, fall into line just as soon
as the returns from remote precincts are
more deftniie."
When asked if be would prolong his
visit in California, he said: "I leave here
to-morrow and will visit Mount Hamil
ton. Then I think I wiil proceed directly
home."
The ReeJ party will leave to-morrow
morning at 8 o'clock on a special train.
They will stop at San Jose, remaining
there two days, when they will visit
Mount Hamilton, and then will proceed
to San Francisco.

PORTLAND, Ok., Nor. s.â The con

editor of a Populist paper of that place,
and A. Ti.zer, a Portland d-ugg.st,
watered that in the event of iMrKinley's

hose on the principal street of Oregon
City. In cas- of Bryan's election Tilzer
was to receive the drenching. Tiizer went
to Oregon City to-day and Fi:ch was

and cheered while F.teh was in range of
the hose. He was almost suffocated when
he got through, and the weather being

McKINLEY'S LEAD
IN CALIFORNIA
Almost Complete Returns
Give 6196 Republican
Plurality.
Remote Precincts Will Make
But Little Change in
the Result
M'LACHLAN AND EOW2RS SAFE.
The Pasadenin Oaly Thirty â  Two
Votes Abeaa in the S.xth
District.
Straggling returns received from remote
precincts in California yesterday did not
enliven the snirits of local iree-silver Dem
ocrats. At the last compilation McKinley
had 144.952 and Bryan 135,756 votes, giving
McKinley a plurality of 6196. The 125
.missing preciucts in lsit-'l s it-' pave Harrison
1792, Cleveland 200S and Weaver 356.
Their entire vote, if ca*t soli ily lor Bryan,
cannot overcome McKinlev's plurality,
but returns from th se precincts may re
duce it to about 5000. The r suit in the
' sections that have not yet sent in returns
will hardly be learned until the official
canvass is made.
Toe reason for the tenacity with which
the Democratic managers adhered to their
claims that Bryan had carried California,
despite the McKinley majority figured
from the count, was explained yesterday.
They had labored under the belief that
in certain counties, notably Los Angeles,
the election clerks neglected to combine the
Democratic and PoDulist electoral vote.and j
â¢ that the returns on McKinley's plurality ;
over the Democratic vote only had been j
reported. An investigation discloses that j
Bryan was accredited with all the votes j
ca*-t for both groups of electors on the
fusion ticket. The following dispatch
. makes it certain that the Nebraskan was

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. s.â Chairman Al
ford of the Democratic State Committee is re
ported as stating that the votes cast for Popu
list electors in LO3 Angeles County were not,
he believed, included in Bryan's to".fil vole.
Mr. Alford's belief is not founded upon iact.
The blacks upon which returns were made to
the Republican committees and to newspapers
iucluded a column for Democratic electors aud
a column for Populist electors. The Democratic
electors receive! 12,402 votes an! the Popu
list electors 3551. The two combined gave a
total of 15,953 The Republican electors re
ceived 16.533 votes. H. Z. Osborne,
Chairman Republican Campaien Advisory
Committee.
Latest returns indicate that in the
Legislature the Renuolicans will have a
majority of twe:Uy-eia;ht on joint ballot
over the combined opposition.
I:i the Â£ix:h and Seventh Congressional
districts the fight has been a merry one.
â¢ With only two precincts to hear from Mc-
Lachlan leads Barlow in the Sixth by
thirty-two votes. The total vote, with-
out these precincts, ir. : McLachlan,
23,556; Barlow, 23,524. The missing pre

County, which in 1*92 gave Harrison 12,
Cleveland 8, Weaver 9, and Cuyama,- in
Ba ita Barbara Connty. which gave Har
rison 2, Cleveland 3, W?av-r 12. \i Re
publican gims have not been made in
these localities since 1892 McLachlan's
plurality will not exceed 15.
Latest returns indicate Congressman
Bowers' re-election by at least 000 votes j
over Castle. Only five precincts in Fresno

taken in connection witb other universal
laws, appears to meet the strongest objec
tions of those who maintain, because con
ditions on other planets are not analogous
to ours, life rannot exist elsewhere in
space. No doubt on Mara, and perhaps
on grander spheres where are studied the
operations of this mite of a wo-M, there
are sentient beings that, regard. ng the
glories and radiance of their ova ex
-18 e nee, doubt that life can endure on a
sphere like the earth, which is wrapped in
clouds, vapor and water.â Albany Jour

STRUCK A MINI
AT BAKERSFIELD
Coin Factory in Running
Order Found in the
Foothills.
Molds, Chemicals and $2500 0
the "Queer" Found in a
Rough Cab.n.
JOHN W. GARN :Â£ IS AREEST^D
S.ys H: Can Establish His Innocence,
but Circumstances Are Strongly
Against Him.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Nov. 5. â A
counterfeiting establishment, complete in
its outfit of tools, molds, chemicals and
all that goes to make up a successful in
stitution of such description, has been
located in the foothilis about four miles
from Bakersfieid, and John W. Garner is
in jail with a charge of counterfeiting
against his name. Garner was. jailed to
day, having given himself up to tbe Sheriff
after learning that a warrant for bi3 arrest
was in existence. He states that he can
establish his innocence and expects to
give bail in any amount, but the circum
stances pointing to his guilt are yo strong
that the officers believe a conviction will
certainly be had, and that friends able to
become bondsmen will be deterred from
such action.
The house of the prisoner, a small,
rough cabin such as settlers on Govern
ment claims usually build, was found to
be literally filled with such chemicals as
imitators of coin use.
There were aiso coin molds, and $2500
in the finished product of the factory was
discovered under the house. The method
pursued by Garner was to mold compo
sition twenties, tens and fives and treat
them to a c;old bath by the electroplating
process. Tliis business must have contin
ued for seyeral years, as drug bills dated
in 1890 were found n his possession and
tbe fact that letters from distant parts ac
knowledging receipt of "goods" and con
taining compliments on the appearance of
the goods were found shows that the plan
. worked was to send the spurious com3
away for other parties to dispose of. Gar-
I ner's occupation for several years has
j been that of sheep-herding. His father
i and mother live in this county, and he is
j said to have two brothers Jiving in the
I uorthern portion of tne State.

McKinley's Election Puts Aetr Life Into
Biiainexs .
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. s.â An imme
diate revival of business is apparent here
as the ressiilt of McKinley's election.
More real estate business was done to
day than for the pa&t thirty days coui
ined.
One Eastern man closed a deal for a
$10,500 residence property which was held
by option pending the election of McKin
lej\ W. C. Kmball, president of the
Bank of National City, which closed its
doors two months ago, received a tele
gram to-day from New York announcing
that the money required was forthcoming
to put the bank on its feet and pay every
one of the depositors in full, amounting
to $51,000, and the bank will resume busi
ness. .";:>â¢â -. V- V.
It was forced to close by the hard times
prevailing during the past two years.
Work began yesterday on the extension or
the San Diego Electric Railway in two
portion! o! the city, which wa* held back
pending the election. McKinley's triumph
started the dirt to flying and both exten
sions will be completed by Christmas.
Judge Henry Schaefer of Los Angeles
will at once begin the erection of a mree

man, president of the Biocnrnan Banking
Company, is authority for the statement
t that a customer of his bank took out > $28,
-i 000 in cold which he had in a security

banks report the same condition of af
fairs. Loans were almost impossible be
fore the election, but are now easily nego
tiable on good security.

ARE THEY INHABITED?
Interesting Speculation Concerning
Venus and liars.
One does no catch the fuil significance
at first of tue statement that both Venus
and Mercury turn on their axes in /he
same time that they revolve about the sun.
But a moment's thought will show that,
if such be the case, there is no succession
of day and night on either Venus or Mer
cury. Insead, on one side of the planet
it is perpetual day ; on the other eternal
darkness reigns. Buch a state of affaire,
so entirely foreign to anything terrestial'
cannot fail to cpen the way lor much ml
terestin^ specuiauon. Can life be sus
tained under such strange conditions as
thai? Court a planet be inhabited on
which lia.f the suriace never knew the
light and the other half never Knew the
absence of light?
Percival Lowell, who fonnded the Flae
; staff Observatory especially to study tbe
! canals of Mars, is tirmly convinced ;hat
; that planet at least is the abode of mtelli
â  gent beings; yet the question of day and
j night aside, Venus seems a great deal
! more fitted to support l.fe similar to that
jon the earth than does Mar-. Venus has
a dense atmon here; that ot Mars is very
rare. The strict astronomer will say that
the question of habitability of any or al!
of the planets is a mailer of pure specula
tion; yet the bolder minds, intent on
pushing on irom the known to the un
known, do not hesitate to affirm that sci
ence will yet bave something to s.ay on
this grandest of problem-. In any case
further news about Venus and Mercery
will be eagerly awaited.â New York Mail

EEPUBLICAN U. 5. SENATOR-
A Lonely Popocrat Among the Large
Army of Victorious Republican
Statesmen.
The present returns on the Assembly
and the Senate, complete in nearly all dis
tricts, show that the Republicans will
have the ample working majority of 28
overall otuer parties combined in the
State Legislature. In the Senate there is
a Republican majority of 16, including
the Holdovers, and in the Assembly a ma
jority of 12.
These figures are based upon the re
liable and the very latest returns received
by The Call. There are a few remote dis
tricts in which tbe count has not yet
either been completed or sent in, but
th-re are not enough of these to affect the
fact of a good Republican majority in the
next Legislature or possibly reduce this
majority more than three or four votes.
This insures the election of a Republican
United States Senator.
In the comparatively few districts in
which the returns are not complete the
majority of the leading candidates is so
considerable that^it is doubtful if it can be
overcome by their competitors. They
have, where they are several hundred
votes ahead, been reported as good as
elected, and they have been counted as
such. A star in the subjoined tables indi
cates candidates ahead in the count, the
others are elected.

MUDGETT MURDER AT USAL.
Citizens Anxiously Await the Arrival of
Officers to Make Arrests of Sus

CAHTO, Cal., Nov. s.â Arrests in the
Mudgett murder case were to-day deferred
until to-morrow, owing to the failure of
the Sheriffs party to reach here to-day.
They have, however, started, and are
wfchin five hours' drive of TJsal. The
town constable declined to undertake the
arrest of the guilty ones alone, believing
it unduly hazardous.
All efforts to break throueh the reti
cence observed by the citizens in shield
ing the identity of the suspects prove
futile, as they fear that the first alarm of
suspicion being directed toward the par
ties would put them to flight. The ex
citement was suppressed to-day for the
purpose of offsetting any alaim and there
by gaining time for the tardy county offi
cers. To-morrow's proceedings are eagerly
but quietly awaited.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1896.
STANFORD WILL
TRY HARD TO WIN
Freshmen Practice for the
Football Game With
Berkeley.
Intercollegiate Event to Wh eh
Much Importance Is
Attached.
SATURDAY'S BASEBALL GAMF.
Captain Thompson Discusses the Pros
pects ol His M n Against the
Tufts-Lyons Team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
5. â The freshman eleven a.c practicing
hard for the game next Saturday acainst
the Berkeley freshman. This is an inter
collegiate event of great importance, and
Stanford is eager to win a freshman game
from Berkeley, who has thus far managed
to carry off both fieshman intercollegiate
matches. This year Stanford has several
good individual playets among the fresh
men, but the team has had little or uo
practice as a team until the past week,
when Captain Murphy has had his men at
work on signals. Twice the freshmen
have lined up against a picked eleven.
Last evening this eleven included many of
the Varsity players, yet the 'OO's made a
first-rate showing against the older play
ers. If there remained sufficient time to
train a good back and to stiffen up the
line some there is no doubt that a strong
aggregation of players could be got to
gether. At any rate Captain Murphy is
confident of giving the opposing team
plenty to do in the game Saturday.
The Stanford freshmen will probably
line up as follows: Center, Burnett;
right guard, Ballentine; left guard,
Blanchard ; left tackle. Rusk; right tackle,
Beckett; right end, McGilvray; left end,
Diggles; quarter back, Murphy; right
half, Clemens; left half, Seville; full back,
Lanagan.
The center is quite strong. Burnett is
heavy and active and is likely to make a
substitute Varsity center. Blanchard is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at 190
pounds, but he lacks the aggressiveness
which a guard should possess. With
more practice he should make a good
showing. Bailentine, the other guard, is
very light for guard, but he thoroughly
understands the position and is a strong,
hard player.
Rusk is undoubtedly the best tackle of
the two, but Beckett is making a good
record for a new band at the game. Rusk
is strong at breaking through an opposing
line and if in good condition should make
a good showing Saturday.
Diggles and McGilvray are both speedy
men and clever tacklers when once aroused
to play for all there is in them. Murphy
is an excellent quarter and his beady
work should do much toward winning the
game. Clemens and Scoviile make an ex
cellent pair of backs and Lanagan at full
is not only a good punter but he is an ex
cellent ground-gainer. He bucks hard
and runs well wit < the ball.
Stanford's baseball spirit is greatly ex
ercised at present over a scheduled game
with the Tufts-Lyons team of Los An
geles. The management has arranged for
the came to-morrow at 2 p.m. Since the
matter was settled Captain Thompson of
Stanford has been busy looking over the
material he has on band. On being ques
tioned as to the prospects of his team he
said:
â¢'lt is difficult to say just what kind of
showing our team will make. Of course,
the old players should put up their usual
came, but all are but of practice. Mc-
Lame will pitch for us. He should prove
effective if his arm holds out. In case he
is unable to pitch the game throu Rud
dell, who plays second, will be put in the
box. Among the men on last year's Var
sity are Young, first base; McLaine
pitcher; Sharpe, third base, and Jeffs.
Jeffs, however, will be unable to play, ow
ing to a sprained ankle, due to football.
Beside? these we have C. Strohn, Wight,
Ruddell and Freeman. Several of the
fresha:en have entered with good baseball
records. Murphy and Clemens will act as
substitutes from the freshman class. Ido
not care to risS new men on the team in a
match game until I have seen them play."
When asked if he intended to have the
team out for practice he answered that it
would not be advisable, as the men would
simply wear â  themselves out and they
would be too sore to play a good game to
morrow. One practice game would not
benefit the team.'- .

Court here to-day, charged with securing
$100 from Fred Brown of Windsor by fraud
and misrepresentation. Whelan was a
traveling agent for the Continental Build
ing and Loan Company of San Francisco,

several confiding persons in this county
and Hed to Oregon. He was captured
near Astoria by a Healdsburg constable
ana brought back to face his accusers.
The secretary of the building and loan
company is one of the chief witnesses for

RED BLUFF BUNGLAUN.
The Buekland Family Chloroformed and
Itobbed Hhile Sleeping.
RED BLUFF, Cal., Nov. s.â The resi
dence of C O. Buekland in this town was
burglarized Tuesday night. The burglars
entered from the rear, chloroformed the
occupants and then turned everything
upside down. Even the mattress upon
which Mrs. Buckiand slept had been
raised and search made under it for
valuables, as was evident by two spoons
having been dropped on the bed under
the mattress. A watch, some silverware
an'i $32 in money were missing on s arch
being made. The Sheriff learned that the
burglars had attempted to dispose of the
watch to Adler & Sobel, dealers in second
hand poods, but had failed to make a
trade. The person who made the offer to
sell the watch was a tall man, about 50
years of age, with a few weeks' beard on
bis face.
J <mr% MarthnW* Hill filed.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. s.â The will
of the late James Marshall was filed for
probate here to-day. The estate is valued
at $65,000, and consists of farming land in
Mann and Sonoma counties, residence
property in this city and bank stock.
Fannie Armstrong and Sarah J. Marshall
are willed two tracts containing 1700 acres
in Mann County and several smaller
tracts. To Mrs. Marshall, widow of the
deceased capitalist, is left al! the rest and
residue of the estate and she is named sole
executrix.
PANCOURE INPERIMENTING
Succettful Te*t* of the Cyanide Process
of Gnl I t.xtrac ion.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. sâ The
cyanide process of gold ext action is very
largely used in the Transvaal and in
Western Australia, but until recently this
method, which very successfully enables
the precious metal to be obtained even
from tailings and low grade ores, has re
mained untried in British Columbia.
However, the Gold Extracting Company,
wh.ch has the Canadian rights in the pro
cess, has lately made a very successful at
tempt to extract the bullion from crush
ings ol Cariboo Â«iold. The Williams Creek
Consolidated Mining Company of Barkers
ville has, as a result, obtained a brick
weighing 31.66 ounces of gold and silver,
607 fine, and worth about $100, the golu
being saved at a cost of $10 a ton. Only
one stamp was used, but hve stamps can
be made available for the preliminary
crusbinps with an rqual amount of labor.
Then the cost of the whole reduction pro
cess will be reduced to $3 50 a ton.
The use of the other and better mechani
cal appliances than those at the moment
available at Baricerville will further in
crease the fineness of the output, bringing
it from 607*pÂ«r mill to 880. However, this
first experiment sufficiently proves the
avaiiability of the process with quartz ores
and tailings, and it shouid, as in Austra
lia and South Africa, render British Co
lumbia gold ores profitably workable even
wlien running only about three-quarters
of an ounce to the ton. Up to the present,
really low-^rade gold ores have been little
regarded or worked in British Columbia.

THE CHRISTIAN
ENDEAVORERS
Tenth Anniversary of
Golden Gate Union
Celebrated.
A Review of the Labors of the
Society ior the Past
Year.
THE NINETY-SEVEN COMMITTEE
Preparing for the Intern itional Con
vention to Be H--.d Here
Next July.
The tenth anniversary of G-.tklen Gate
Union of Christian Endeavor was held last
evening at the First Baptist Church on
Eddy street. The edifice was crowded and
the services wereiistened to with attention.
Upon the platform were President J. A.
Wiles, First Vice-President Louis Titus,
Second Vice-President .Miss Susie A. Ward,
Corresponding Secretary Miss Hcttie Rey
nolds, Recording Secretary Miss M. C.
Sanquist and Treasurer Charles M. Whit
ney, officers of the union.
The services began with selections by
the church orchestra, followed by praise
-ervice led by Robert P. Evans, doxology,
Lord's prayer, responsive reading, chorus
and the Gloria from Mozart's twelfth
mass.
The following is the report of Recording
Secretary Minnie C. Sanquist:
The earnestness and enthusiasm which char
acterized our mass-convention of three mouths
ago seems to have embodied itself iuto an
abiding presence. Work along a.l lines is
being earnestly pushed forward, and our so
cietit-sare busy planning and accomplishing
for 1897. Our union committees are making
every effort tell lor this greiu cause.
Various intermediate and junior societies
are putting their shoulders to the wheel, help
ing to raise the convention i uuds.
The superintendent of junior work reports
their ninth quarterly convention success! ul
in everyway. A junior society has been or
ganized at the Hamilton - square Baptist
Church. Howard Presbyterian Junior Socie ty
has been reorganised. The Boys' Junior So
ciety of the I'ark Congregational Church has
disbanded, owing to the resignation of its
superintende:it. Intermediate societies have
been organized at the First Chru-tian and
first Baptist churches, and a senior f. P. S
C. E. has boon organized at the First Congre
gational Church ot Snusalito. A hearty wel
come is extended to all our new societies.
The military authorities contemplate aban
doning Angel Island as a military post, and
our work at the island has been given up. The
good literature committee are distributing
books and papers at the hospitals, Newsboys'
Home, Children's Home, outgoing ships and to
the Indian school in Humboidt County. The
individual societies are somewhat delinquent
in the matter of reporting their work in this
line to the committee. It is very important
that reports be sent monthly to the chairman
of thi* committee, that the work may be car
r.ed on systematically.
The floating committee has been working
faithfully and the September report alone
shows an enrollment of thirty new members;
this is the largest membership received any
one month since Us organization. The picnic
given to our sailor boys on Admission day
proved a grand success.
The lookout committee is Keeping in touch
with all our societies. Several have been vis
ited during tlu- last quarter and the meetings
led by members of that committee. The rally
at San Rafael. October 23, was attended by
nearly 200 San Francisco Endeavorers and
proved an enthusiastic and helpiul meeting
to all.
The fellowship and Sunday morning prayer
meeting committees are actively at work.
The Christian Endeavor Bulletin, which
made its first appearance on October 17, is a
weedy, published in the interest of C. E.
work, and is issued by the press committee
of the Golden Gate Union. Every Etideavorer
siiouid be a subscriber and every society
should have a number of copies for distribu
tion, thus enabling all members and others
interested to keep in touch with our inter
national convention work. The subscription
rate is within the reach oi allâ l cent percopy.
All societies are urged to pui forward every
effort in raising the amount assessed them for
the '97 fund promptly. The time for the great
convention is rapidly drawing near; a vast
amount of preliminary work must be done.
an<l tne '97 committee rely upon the prompti
tude of ttie societies in making the monthly
contributions.
At this time, perhaps more than any other,
will the success of our undertakings depend
upon personal efforts. Let the representatives
to the union report proceedings of the execu
tive meetings in their respective societies, so
that all may keep in touch with the work.
Rolla V. Watt, the chairman of the
international convention "committee of
'87," addressed the assembled delegates
and members of Golden Gate Union on
the subject of raising :unds tortl;e '97 con
ventio . It was expected that Mr. Watt
would outline the duties of the committees
who will have charge of the work of pre
paration, but he dcci ed that it would be
belter to wait the coming of General Sec
retary John W lhs Baer, wtio is expected
to arrive about November 15.
Mr. Watt ur^ed tlte societies to contrib*
ute their pro rata of the $5000 pledged by
;he union as promptly as possible. Al
ti ou^h tne pledges are not duo until May,
1897, over $900 uas been paid to the treas
urer.
The fund for '97 amounts to $25,000.
Two thousand five hundred dollars bas
been pledged by the Alameda County
Union. $5000 by the Golden Gate Union of
Chri Man Endeavor and $17,500 by the
merchants of this City.
This fund will be expended largely in
advertising this great convention. Thou
sands of beautiful posters advertising
California will be sent East by the "com
mittee of '97." and every means will be
used to make California and its gr*at
natural advantag s well known the world
around. In addition to advertising
money will be expended for halls, decora
tions, excursions, etc.
All delegates will Day their own ex
penses while in the City, and it is antici
pated that at least 15,000 will cross the
Rocky Mountains next year to visit the
Golden State.
The convention will be held July 7 to 12,
1897. It will be an international affair.
Delegates will come from every country in
the worid. The following members of the
'97 committee were announced:

OLYMPIC POOL MATCH.
Close Contest* Being Playedâ The dan
Club's >ew Quarters.
The entries in the Olympic Club ball
pool tournament have made a better
showing than they have in years, both in
attendance each night and in the point of
play. Last night was the exception,
Hardee, Fuller and James being the only
players to show up. Fuller and Hardee,
both scratch men at 65 points, had a com
paratively easy thing against James, who
made but 14 points in the first gam* and
only 30 points in tbe second.
In each game he has been allowed a
handicap of 25 balls.
Cunningham and Fuller are the only
two entries so far who have not lost a
game, but Bachman and Hodgkins, with
five winnings against one and four against
one respectively, appear to be the leaders
in this tournament.
The full score to date is as follows.

IRE OF A STATE SENATOR.
Sam Braunhart Declares His Freedom
I'rcim M a nu ire Â»iid Daggett.
An interesting character in the next
Legislature will be State Senator Samuel
Braunuart of this City.
Mr. Braunhart is an orator of no mean
ability, and aB he served a term as a mem
ber of the Assembly several years ago he
will be greeted as an old acquaintance by
the hundreds of regular attendants on the
sessions of the Legislature and who make
up that conglomerate body of persons j;eu
erally known as the third :. ou.se.
At the Democratic State headquarters
Mr. Braunhart has frequently raised his
voice since the result oi tbe election in h-s
district became known. It is learned from
h is oft-repeated remarks that Mr. Braun
hart has grievances against some of the
members of his party, and as he will be
called on to cast a ballot, for some ambi
tious politician who wants the prest'ge
bestowed by the complimentary vote for
United States Senator he seems to be
clearing the road of certain candidates
who might consider themselves eligible
an<l entitled to his support.
"I can't say much for Judge Maguire's
Democracy when it comes tolojal issues,"
said Mr. Brauuhart. "He refused to make
a speech in my district to help the legis
lative ticket, though he spoke most every
where else in the City. I don't consider
myself under any obligations to him."
Judge Maguire was silting in the adjoin
ing room, and all the doors b.ing wide
open he could not avoid hearing Mr.
Braunbart's remarks.
When spoken to in regard to the matter
Judge Maguire sententiously replied:
"O, Sam may go to heaven. I haven't any
time to waste thinking about him."
"There's John Daggett, too, who didn't
care to help me," continued Mr. Braun
hart. "He might have strengthened me ii
he had wanted to, but he didn't. Po far
as I know not an employe of the United
States Mint vot d for me. Thai shows
how far Mr. John Daggett was interested
in my success. I'm not under obligations
to him, either."
After that Mr. Braunhart be. an to talk
about a circular which nad been thrown
about with a view to cutting down his
vote, and was about to continue the list of
those to whom he owes no ttnnKs w;.en a
member of the State Committee stopped
him with the remark:
'"Now see here, Bam, you've been kick
ine for two days, and t at ought to be long
enough. Aren't you satisfied with 1000
majority? You oug-.t to be, for lots of
the boys are -lad to get along witn less.
Just let us all know when you are going
to make your big speech and we'll all come
up to Sacramento to hear you."
In accordance with this advice Mr.
.braunuart has consented f o reserve his
eloquence until next January.

Fitzsmmons, Wife, Child
and Manager, at the
Baldwin.
Julian Says That Corbett Can
not Be Induced to Fight
Anybody.
FITZ CONFIDENT OF VICTORY.
The Pugilists Will Meet Tc'-Day to
Select a Referee and Sign
Articles.
Bob Fitzsimmons, his wife and child
and his manager, Martin Julian, arrived
last evening and are now domiciled at the
Baldwin Hotel. Hickey and Baker, pu
gilists of some note, accompanied the
middle and heavy-weight pugilist
from the East. They will act as trainers
and rubbers when the Conushman will
commence to condition himself for the
fijiht which is booked for the evening of
December 2, under the auspices of the Na
tional Athletic Club.
Fiizsimmons was very much pleased to
meet a lar.'e gathering of friends who as
sembled at the Oakland ferry Jast evening
to receive him on his arrival. The cham
pion middle-weight looks just the same
as of old. He weighs about 185 pounds
and intends to enter the ring at about 175
pounds.
"When we were traveling through Eng
land," said Julian, "I offered Â£100 ($500)
to any man who could stand up before
Bob for four rounds, but I never had the
opportunity of wagering the amount.
"The big fellows would size Fitz up and
then walk away, npuarentiy sutistied that
the game waa a little too hard for them to
tarkle."
When asked why the proposed match
between Corbett and Fitz had fallen
through Julian's eves sparkled, and, after
a Â«<hort pav e, he said that Corbett has no
ldta of fighting anybody.
"Why, you w-.1l remember," remarked
Julian, "that I arranged a banquet m New
York for the members of ;he pr#ss. My
idea was to bring Corbett and F.tzsinimona
face to face before the sporting editors of
the different New York papers, but Cor
bett remained away, because he knew that
he would be forced into a match or elsg
display the white feather. Well, I kept
after him and taunted^him in every way
imaginable to sign articles of agreement.
He said finally that he was short of money,
and could not raise $10,000 for a side
wager; that some of his best friends had
gone back on him, and a lot of such rot.
"Well, I agreed to a side bet of $5000,
and then he requested me to draw up a
set of articies and send him a copy of
them to his training quarters at Asbury
Park, which I did five weeks ago, and I
have not heard from him since.
"Ttie sporting editors of Eastern pa
pers who defended Corbett right along
are now shooting hot shot at him, and
unless he decides upon fighting Bob
within the next few months or announc
ing his retirement from the ring ne will
receive a very cold reception from the
sporting people of the Ee*t. ,
"I believe that the managers of the
National Ciub are fair-minded sportsmen,
and 1 have also every reason to beiieve
that Sliarkey means to do what is right
and proper so far as the arrangements for
our fight are concerned. We certainly
look for only a fair field anil no favors
extended; consequently I am of the
opinion that tuere will be litile difficulty
in selecting an honorable and just referee
::mong the sporting fraternity of this
City.
"I will have a chat with Mr. Sharkey to
morrow, after which I will select a train
ing station for Bob. Ido not know where
we will locate, but I propose thai Bob

â¢ THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Bryan concedes it.
Chairman Jones gives it up.
By the way, what has become of tne
populists?
McKinley breaks the record with a mil
lion majority.
Now that we have downed the dema
gogues let us keep them down.
Cleveland and Hill are together at last,
like two men on a raft in a wide, wide
sea.
California's share of the feast of victory
onpht to be nothing less than Cabinet
pudding.
Bryan's congratulation to McKinley
was a little bit late, but it will serve all
purposes.
Money will soon be circulating so fast
that Silurians will have to hustle to keep
up with it.
Woman suffrage was defeated at the
pells, but the campaign of education, keeps
right along. -'''y-'-"^
The fellows who talked about coercion
are the fellows who are doing the least
talking now.
There is a chance for a joint debate be
tween Bryan and Altgeld as to which hoo
dooed the other.
Secretaries Olney, Morton and Carlisle
did not vote, but they were not missed in
the summing up.
It may still be pertinent to inquire
where that much-talked-of coercion took
place last Tuesday. -v* Â
Considering the odds against them loyal
Republicans have good reason to be satis
fied with the result.
The . next mystery story will be a re
nuest for ypu to guess at the composition
of McKinley's Cabinet.
In spite of the fusion opposition, In
spite of traitors in the party, we have
carried the City and carried the State.
The Thanksgiving proclamation camo
out in time to Bound like Cleveland's ex
pression of relief at the overthrow of Bry
anism.
It must be a source of great regret to the
free-traders that they did not improve the
navigation of Salt River while they had
the power.
The first thing for returning prosperity
to look for in the home market is horn*
goods and it ought not to stop until it
finds them.
Mr. Laumeister may eventually crawl
out of the hole he dug for himself, but his
hopes of political preferment are buried
there forever.
The ablest binder in the country is
but a small potato now when compared
with the fellow who has a place on the
football teams. , -
The McKinley administration will re
store prosperity, and it is safe to say we
have seen the last tidal wave election of
this generation. -
. \ Altgeld's shrieK of wrath sounds more
like anarchy than ever, but it comes from
the deep pit of political defeat and is no
longer listened to.
There may be no such thing as perpet
ual youth, but all the same it is an
nounced that Gladstone is learning how
to ride the bicycle.
There will never be . another party in
this generation that will wage a campaign
to establish the right to take an appeal
from the Supreme Court to a'niob.
,â, â Â» ,
The Populist party in this State has
been so badly lost in the shuffle it can
hardly be expected to turn up, no matter
what sort of a deal is made next time.
The Bering Sea question and the Vene
zuelan question will probably be among
those which Cleveland will leave for the
McKinley administration to solve and
settle.

Now is the time to preach the doctrine
of unity of effort in industrial enterprises.

people. . '. : f i,;; ) ; : ;;'i ':â 
The conservative Democrat knows not
where he is, but the intelligent among
them will have sense enough to stay
where they are until the situation
clears up. .
*-<* ~ - *
It is a good thing for tbe Democratic
tiger that it managed to swallow tbe
Populists at the beginning of the cam
paign, for it will hare bat slim rations for
the next four years.
The State Legislature is to be orer
whelminjjly Republican and now is the
time lor the party to show what it can do
for the advancement of the State and the
promotion of legislative reform*.
It has no doubt been noticed br our
readers that during the campaign we gave
full reports from both sides with an im
partial accuracy in accordance with our
motto, "Thk Call speaks for all."
It was said during the canvass that no
Presidential candidate ever made such a
campaign as Bryan, and now that thÂ« re-
suit is known it may be added that na
candidate hereafter will erer attempt it.
"THE CALL" IN THE CAMPAIGN.
The result of the National and local
election is sufficiently ascertained to jus
tify The Call's indulgence in sorae self
oongntnlatiOÃ upon the part which it has
taken in the campaign. For the past two
years this newspaper has been constantly
and consistently Republican, and with
both reason and faith has advocated the
return of the Republican party to popular
favor and to power.
At the commencement of tne campaign
Thk Call took its place openly and proudly
among the elements and the agencies
which represented and supported the reg
ularity of the party organization in both
State and National politics, and this posi
tion it has steadfastly maintained. From
first to last it reiterated the idea that this
was a campaign which called for party
loyalty of the most unselfish kind, and
insisted that no considerations of personal
ambition or petty local dissensions should
be permitted to divide the party or weaken
the force of its effort for National and local
success.
For this devotion to the interest? of the
Republican party The Call finds in its
victory the most satisiying reward. The
battle in California was by no means an
easy one to win. The combined strength
of tbe Democratic and Populist parties,
according to the vote of two years ago,
would have given over the State to the
Bryanites by about 10.WX) majority. This
was tbe outlook at the beginning of the
campaign. It required a daily renewal of
hope and inspiration to overcome the ef
fect of fusion and to win back the allegi
ance of the people of California to the
Republican party.
It -was upon The Call that this
duty mainly devolved. It was the only
San Francisco daily newspaper which
remained absolutely loyal to the Re
publican party and which supported
loyally and unselfishly its regular organ
iaztions in their struggle ior success.
Against it have been arrayed the com
bined strength not only of its bu-iness
competitors and political enemies, but
also of those who should have been its
friends and allies in the campaign. Tne
battle of The Call has therefore been of
necessity a two-handed one, and while en
gaged in aggressive conflict in the fore
front of its party, it has also been com
pelled to rebuke and quell disloyalty and
treason within the party lines.
To this dual duty The Call has devoted
its untiring eflort during the entire course
of the campaign, and it has every reason
to felicitate itself upou the outcome, and
upon the part which it has taken In the
result. The National ticket has been
borne to a substantial victory in California.
The majority of the Congressional nomi
nees have also achieved success in their
respective districts. The legislative ticket
has won out by a very comfortable
majority. A g odly number of the local
offices will be filled by Republicans during
the next two years. In the success of ail
who have been successful, The Call will
find no difficulty in being accorded its
proper meed of praise for having
contributed largely to the victory.
And from those who made a gallant but a
losing tu'ht as the regular nominees of
the Republican party The Call can be
given no just criticism for disloyalty to
their cause.
Even from those of its political enemies
who are honest, and from the can
didates of other parties who, -whether
successful or otherwise, are just. The
Call will be accorded the credit of
having conducted a clean, honorable and
in every way decent campaign. It has
indulged in none of the discreditable
methods to which newspapers are oft
times tempted during tho heat of an elec
tion. It has published no word and
printed no picture of which it Has reason
to be ashamed. It has reported fairly and
justly the meetings and proceedings of
opposing parties, and in the truest sense
of fair and honorable journalism it has
gpoken for all.
The campaign is over. The election has
come and gone. The result is established
beyond further denial or dispute. The
Republican party has won. Tne organ
izers, the party leaders, the brilliant ora
tors and tbe faithful laborers whose com
bined effort has achieved this splendid
victory deserve all commendation. Amonx
tbe band of faithful laborers in the cause
of Republicanism and in the lanks of the
party, The Call is proud to count Itself as
one and to believe itself entitled to its
proper share of praise.
LAUMEISTER'S HAEI-KARL
Charles S. Laumeister has committed
political hari-kari, fie has retired him
self from politics and crawled into the
hole which is the grave of nis political
fortune. He has done tbis deliberately
and apparently from no motive save that
of assisting the Chronicle, Martin Kelly
and a few other soreheads to gratify their
personal spile against the organized Re
publican party of San Francisco.
Mr. laumeister is a man who owed
much to the Republicans of this City. T..ey
have honored him repeatedly by election
to office and in other ways. They had
reason to expect trom him a loyal support
of tbe party in all its battles, even when
the odds against it were great. They have,
therefore, weighty reasons to condemn
him for party treason at a time when a
complete Republican victory could have
been won bad he refused to make himself
the tool of party traitors.
Two Republicans of eminence had re
fused tbe thankless and dishonorable task
which Mr. Laumeister undertook to per
form. Horace Davis and H. P. Sonntag,
who had been chosen by the party traitors
to lead them in the fight against organized
Republicanism, had positively declined to
do so. Mr. Laumeister accepted the work
rejected by these honorable gentlemen
and thus put himself in shameful contrast
with their party loyalty and civic patriot
ism.
At the time Mr. Laumeister consented
to lead the conspirators in their efforts to
divide the Republican vote, it was clear
he could not by any possibility be elected.
All that he could expect to accomplish
would be to defeat Colonel Taylor and
prevent a clean and sweeping Republican
victory in the City. This much he hoped
to do, and backed by the Chronicle and the
Kelly gang he has succeeded in doing it.
It is easy to see from the vote cast what
has been tbe result of tbis party treason.
The vote of the City was given by a small
majority for McKinley and Hobart. The
vow (riven for Republican Presidential
electors would have been given for the Re
publican candidate for Mayor had not the
dissensions in the party stirred up by
Laumeister, the Chronicle, Kelly and others
of the gang discomfited and discouraged
Republicans in the municipal campaign.
These dissensions led them to despair of
success, and many of them and their con
â fervativo Democratic allies, who would
otherwise have voted for Colonel Taylor,
cast their votes for opposing candidates.
Had it not been for Laumeister nnd the
Chronicle the Republican vote in this City
would have been so large as to have car
ried California for McKinley and Hobart
by a majority of which the party could
have been proud. As it is tbe victory has
been far from aa overwhelming defeat of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER G, 1896.
the fusion forces and leaves them hope of
success hereafter. It is hard, therefore, to
overrate the evil which has been caused
to the Republican party and the injury
done to the great cause of protection,
sound money and conservative govern
ment by there party traitors.
The one benefit to be drawn from
the resnit is that loyal Republicans
will make a note of the traitors, study
tbe effect of their treason and be pre
pared to guard against it in future.
Mr. Laumeister has committed political
suicide, and the Chronicle will no longer
be regarded as a representative cf the Re
puDlican party in California.
MAYOR-ELECT PHELAN.
WbilQ Thb Call regrets the defeat of
Colonel Taylor, it feels some satisfaction
in the fact that his successful opponent
has been James D. Phelan. The Mayor
elect has not had the experience in public
life of Mr. Taylor, but his antecedents and
his environments are such as to cive rea
son to the general hope that he will ad
minister the affairs of the City' with pood
judgment, fidelity and unquestioned hon
esty.
The power of a Mayor in San Francisco
is not preat. Nevertheless the man who
holds it represents the people and the
City, and a community is largely iudged
by his personal character. His influence,
also, if heis a man capable of exerting an
influencejQirgely compensates for the lack
of official power. It is therefore fortunate
that in this election we have secured as
Mayor of the City a man who represents
tbe better element of its people and who
has shown an interest in public matters
which attests his earnest desire to pro
mote administrative reform, municipal
economy and civic progress.
The people will not demand much of
Mr. Phelan in his new office, but they will
reasonably expect him to exert his official
and personal influence on the side of good
r overnment. It is to be hoped that these
expectations will not be disappointed. It
depcDris upon himself whether he is to be
regarded as Mayor Phelan, or as the agent
of Democratic bosses.
For ourselves we have no fear of the re
sult. Mr. Phelan is a man of large prop
erty and has been trained in the manage
ment of business affairs. He has been an
earnest worker in the promotion of many
reforms and of many enterprises in tbe
City. 60 far as his efforts can control the
course of municipal administration we
may reasonably expect that it will be car
ried on in the direction of good govern
ment, for the welfare of the City and the
interests of the people.
THE PASSING OF ALTGELD.
One " of the best features of this cam
paign has been the utter defeat of Altgeld
and tbe forces back of him in Illinois.
This man Das represented the worst ele
ment in American politics. He has not
only represented it, he ha-, been its leader,
its agitator and its champion. Tbe oppo
sition to him has sprung from no ordinary
party feeling. The American people have
refused to recognize in him a normal
political foe. They have learned from his
speeches and from his actions tbat he is
the enemy of lnw and of civil society, the
pardoner of anarchists and the advocate
of riot.
To the power of this dangerous man was
due all the most pernicious features of
tbe Chicago platform. It was his domina
tion that caused the Democratic conven
tion to adopt resolutions denouncing the
enforcement of the law by the General
Government, condemning the Supreme
Court and threatening a campaign which
would have involved had it succeeded a
strife between labor and capital and the
excitement of mobs and riots in every
city of tbe Union.
The people of Illinois did not under
stand Altgeld when they elected him
Governor of their State. They soon
learned to know him however from tne
course he pursued as soon as he became
the chief executive. He showed himself
from the start to be the friend of crimi
nals, and so many convicts and con
demned murderers did he pardon that
bad men ceased to fear the law and good
men no longer trusted to it with confi
dence.
It will be remembered that not long ago
the men who took part in lynching a
criminal in one of the rural districts of
Illinois excused their action on the ground
that Governor Altgeld bad pardoned so
many murderers tbat they were not will
ing to trust the enforcement of the law
into his hands any longer. Thus the
favor shown to criminals by the Governor
led to lawless violence among the people.
It is in this way that one bad action leads
to another, and the law is assailed from
both sides.
The experience with Altgeld's pov
ernorship has converted the people of Il
linois from any tendency they may have
had to support of radical reformers.
He has given them an object-leason which
even the dullest could understand. He
has made it dear that, whatever other re
formers may aim at. Be Is aiming at revo
lution and anarchy. He personifies all
the hatoe, envies and jealousies of the
lowest class in the community, and is
more dangerous than his followers, be
cause he has been gifted with more brains,
more energy and a more dominant will.
It is a source of gratification to the
whole country that he has been defeated.
With his overthrow the people have put a
condemnation upon all for which he
stand.-. The Democratic party may be
relied upon to return hereafter to the
paths marked out by its great conserva
tive leaders, and no future campaign will
show any strong following of the discred
ited anarchist.
TOR THANKSGIVING.
The President's proclamation, setting
apart a day for Thanksgiving, follows so
close upon the defeat of Bryan that it will
seem to many people like an expression
of gratitude for that event. This impres
sion will be augmented by the fact that
among the things which the President
calls upon us to give thanks for is "our
preservation as a Nation and our deliver
ance from threatened dancer."
The American people, however, will
hardly construe the proclamation aa an
expression of Mr. Cleveland's delight st
the result of the election. Certainly, if it
should be to construed there would be a
universal condemnation of the President.
Thanksgiving day has become to us so
truly a National patriotic observance that
no man likes to associate it with partisan
triumph. No matter how great or how
important may have been the issues in
volved in party contests we look upon the
day of thanksgiving as a day of rejoicing
in what has been bestowed upon us by
Providence rather than by what has been
won by the people at the polls.
This country has certainly been favored
above all the nations of the earth during
the past year. We are rejoicing in abun
dant harvests at a time when famine
threatens other lands, and when tbe rising
price of wheat, which signifies prosperity
to us, means the distress of tbe poor in
other parts of the world. We hay.Â» also
abundant evidence that our people hare
been endowed with that wise common
sense which enables them to bear adver
sity with fortitude, and prosperity with
discretion. In material things, in mental
strength, and in moral excellence, there
fore, we have been blessed sufficiently
to make our homes secure and to confirm
the prospects of coming prosperity.
Men of all parties'will unite in giving a
cordial welcome to the proclamation.
Those who voted for Bryan will observe
the great day with as much thankfulness
and lejoicing as those who voted for Me-
Kiuley. The heats of the campaign are
past, political antagonisms are ended, and
once more we feel the sentiment of a com
mon patriotism. Once more we meet our
friends and neighbors without disputes
over differences of opinion and unite in
laving plans for the prosperity which is
to come. The publication of the proclama
tion for Thanksgiving will stimulate the
return of these better feelings, and will
revive m the hearts of the people the
thoughts of all those things for which
they owe gratitude and thanks to the
Giver of all good.

AN INFAMOUS CARTOON.
New York Sun.
Against the ordinary exploits of the new
journalism the individual citizen has protec
tion to this extent, at least, that he can keep
its hideous emanations out of his own house,
and can likewise avoid them, in his daily
movements around town, even as he avoids
other forms of filth. But against one method
of attack known to these unrelenting enemies
of good government and public morals, the
citizen is powerless; his home, his family, his
properly, are alike defenseless.
On Monday last the New York Journal
printed and circulated among the ignorant
and dangerous elements of the community a
picture which may well inspire sober reflec
tion on the part of patriots and right-minded
people. Under the heading "An Ideal Cabinet
for a Plutocratic President" there straggles
over a whole page of the Journal a series of
caricatures of well-known persons assigned re
spectively to what young Mr. Hearst's humor
selects as the appropriate post. Brutal, coarse
and offensive iu'ihe extreme, there is nothing
to distinguish these burlesque presentments
from the general run of the new journalism's
achievements in the field of political satire,
except iv the particular case to which we are
referring.
The cartoon in question exhibits Major-Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles, now commanding the
army of the United States, as young Mr.
Hearst s facetious choice for Secretary of War
in the Cabinet of a plutocratic President.
General Miles sits before a mirror and is pre
tending to contemplate his own lace and neck
tie ; but he is really supervising,thus indirectly,
the performance of a detachment of United
States troops engaged behind his back in
snooting down railroad rioters. Two corpses
lie on the ground, another lies limp across the
top ot a boxcar, while a fourth rioter is falling
before the volley of General Miles' solU ers. A
placard describes this incident as "The Chi
cago Campaign." The general has Just let fall
a roll representing a legislative bill or act,
marked in these words: "Increase the army to
kill off ourselves."
The intention of this picture is as obvious as
it is infamous. It represents a high-minded
soldier, who knows no politics where his duty
is concerned, as the willing agent of an op
pressive plutocracy in the murder of bis fel
low-citizens. It, make* martyrs of rioters
killed in opea and defiant resistance of the
laws. It inculcates in the minds of the ignor
ant and discontented the idea that the men
in blue who carry the flag of the Union are
their enemies, bent on their destruction. It
reverses the real relation between the army
and the people ; glorifying the rioter and pro
voking the vicious and disorderly to bitter
hatred of the United States uniform and of
the men who command our troops.
All this U in perfect keeping with the tone
of the Bryan canvass in the lust desperate
stages; but we are not aware that the true
character of the final appeal of Bryanism to
the forces of revolution and anarchy has been
conveyed by anybody with more reckless
frankness. Does young Mr. Hearst understand
what he is doing? Does he Know that when
he teaches hatred of the uniform and the flag
he is instigating riot and threatening the in
stitutions on which our common security
rests? This is not freedom of the press; it is
the license of sedition. Sedition reaches its
extreme point in young Mr. Heart's latest pic
torial enterprise. Therein we see clearly the
tendencies of the new journalism when en
listed iv tbe cause of anarchy.
A CELESTIAL TRAVELER.
Xe&lsoovery of the Companion of Isirius

The bright star Sirius has a small companion
which was discovered by Alvan Clark Jr. in
1382. It is especially interesting because its
existence was predicted in 1844 by Bessel,
from a consideiation of the irregular motion
of the larger star. The small star moves about
Sirius in an orbit whose circuit is completed
In about flftv years. The mats of the small
star is about one-half the mass of Sirius,
though It has only one ten-thousandth part of
iv light. The mass of the companion is sub
stantially the same as the Bun's mass. It was
last observed by Professor Burnham, at the-
Lick Observatory, in 1890 in angle 359 de
grees, distance 4 seconds. It then approached
so close to Sirius as to be lost in its rays. Its
reappearance was looked for with interest.
Professor Husscy examined the system care
fully during February and March of the pres
ent year, and the companion was not to be
seen. It was still too close. It should have
appeared in Angle 190 degrees, approximately.
On August 31st Dr. See reported that the star
had b -en rediscovered at the Lowell Observa
tory, Flagstaff, Arizona, and later published
measures by himself. Dr. Douglass and Mr.
Cogshall, wnicn placed the star in angle 220
degrees, at a distance of 5 seconds. Mr. Loweil
and Mr. Drew also reported that they saw Dr.
See's companion.
It was remarked on several sides to be a
strange thing that this discovery waÂ« made at
the Lowell Observatory, and not at the Lick
Observatory. It was, however, not possible for
the observers at Mount Hamilton to report any
object whiÂ£h they had not seen.
Kecent observations at Mount Hamilton by
Professor Aitken, on October 24th, 29th and
31st, and by Professor Schaeberle, on October
29th and 31st. show conclusively that there is
no object in the place reported by the astrono
mers of the Lowell Observatory, and that
Clark's companion to Sirius is in its predicted
placeâ namely, in angle 189 degrees, distant
3% seconds. The observations in mil will be
printed in the astronomical journals. The
present note is written to announce the redis
covery at the Lick Observatojy of the object
first found by Mr. Clark in 1862.

Don't tbink because yoa hare views on politics

BLUE-GUM BLOCKS
FOR PAVEMENTS
Merchants' Association Con
sidering the Use of
Wood.
Daniel V. Kelly Elected Director,
Vice R. F. Osborn, De
ceased
MORE STSEET LIGHTS WANTED
An Effort Will Be Made to Put Arc
Lamps on Many More Thor
oughfares.
The re^ilar meeting of the Merchants'
Association was held yesterday.
Resolutions of respect to the memory of
the late director, Robert F. Osborn, were
passed.
Ernest McCuJlough, engineer of the
association, presented the following report
on the use of blue-gum blocks for street
pavement:
Regarding tbe use of eucalyptus as a caving
material 1 have to report that the pamphlet
prepared by Consul Bell of Sydney seems con
clusive, and other documents received show
that his claims are well borne out, as the
material has given excellent satisfaction in
Australia. It has not been tried here, but
uiier considerable correspondence and exam
ination I believe we have enough material
here to use experimentally and ample to sup
ply the demand lor some time to come.
Our blue gum and red gum are. I believe,
the tame varieties of euca.yptus known un
der similar names in Australia, and of those
two varieties California has considerable forest
area. The samples of wooU furnished to this
association by Messrs. Hill and Scott from
streets in Kidney are of the eucalyptus
pilularis. But as Consul Bell stated in his
pamphlet, several varieties of eucalyptus are
used in Australia, and the comparative merits
are still a matter of controversy, local favor
itism making claims for each variety.
1 have been surprised to find the literature
of eucalypti so extensive, and that from
Australia is most reliable. Nearly all the
matter published in California is newspaper
and magazine work, whtch is not always ex
act and often contradictory.
I have endeavored to find out what the cost
will be of eucalypti pavements and have been
unable to get any lower figures than 25 cents
per square foot lor the material laid on the
street in blocks from six to eight inches long,
three or four inches thick ana six inches
deep. To this must be added the cost of
foundation and laying, which will make the
pavement cost double what our ordinary
pavements cost. This question of cost will
settle tbe matter unless some experience in
furnisliirg the material will result in lower
ing the price. Consul Bell believes it possible to
ship the wood from Australia and lay it in the
streets here ior a price which will not exceed
that of asphalt pavements. If this can really
be done our local millmen should be able to
furnish the wood at lower rates than 25 cents
per square foot.
Mr. Gillespie of San Jose has given the
eucalyptus a better and more thorough trial
than any one cisc I have talked with. He is
quite enthusiastic over it, and his experience
demonstrates that the wood is capable of a
great use if only our people can be brought to
believe it to be of any better use than the
manufacture of flea-powder and catarrh cures.
He says that for waiion- making it is superior
to second-jfrowth hickory and ash, which
have heretofore' been considered the best
materials for wagons. It is good for all work
which rÂ» quires a tough, lasting wood, and is
ono of the best woods for piling, as the teredo
does not attack It readily. The tree is fit to
use for paving after about seveu or eight
years's growth.
A number of property-owners down
town have already requested the board to
make efforts for securing the lighting of
the streets by electricity. The subject
will be at once considered by the commit
tee on public affairs and a report made at
tbe next meeting of the board.

passes is to be found in section 138b of the
Civil Code of this Btate. The section is a very
long one and the want of space prevents its re
production in this department.

LiGHTHocsES-E. X., City. The lights at the
Mendocino and Pigeon Point lighthouses on
the coast of California are of equal power
each being a first-class light. The most dan
gerous of the two points named is Mendocino.
Probably the most dangerous coast of North
America is thÂ»tof Caoe Hatteras and the most
dangerous in the world is said to be the coast
of the west side of Ireland and the west coast
of France. The light at Hatteras is a first
class light. These lights may be seen at a dis
tance varying from fifteen to twenty-four
miles, according ;o the altttnde at which the
light is placed and the condition of the
weather. It is said that the lighthouse, or
more properly lighthouses, at one point fur
nishing tho most powerful light in the world
are those at South Foreland, a promontory on
tho east coast of Kent, England. There are
two fixed lights, respectively 380 and 275 feet
above the sex, visible twenty-live and twenty
two miles. Each light is eo,ual to 180,000
candle-power. The greatest recorded distance
at v.hich a 1 ght from a lighthouse has been
visible is that of the holophotal light of Alle-
Bey, at Travancore, which has been seen from

StaÂ« Route Fraudsâ A. C. X., Auburn,
Placer County, Cttl. "Star routes" is the
name applied to postal routes over which the
mails cannot be carried by railroad or steam
boat. In 1881 Second Assistant Postmaster
Thomas J. rtrady and others, including Sena
tor S. W. Dorsey of Arkansas, were accused of
combining with certain mail contractors to
defraud the Government. The combination
had originally 134 routes, upon which thecom
pensation lor service under the contract
amounted to $143,169. By increasing tho
number of trips per week and shortening
the contract time and allowing for
each trip, the compensation was raised
to $622,808. Dorsey was brought to trial in
1882. He made a complete denial of all the
charges, and the jury tailed to agree. On tho
second trial he was acqui 1 ted. M. C. Rerdell,
a cierk for Dorsey, and John R. Minei,who
had made the bids lor the contracts. Were
convicted, but all the others were acquitted.
Kwasind âH. W., Eebastopol, Sonoma
County. CaL According to Indian tradition
Ewasind was the strongest man that ever
lived, the Hercules of the American Indians.
It is said of nim that he could pull up pine
trees and cedars by the roots and hurl large
bowlders about like a child would pebbles. His
wondrous strength was seated in his crown
and there of course lay bis point of weakness.
Tne only weapon that could injure him was
the blue cone of the fir tree, but this
was a secret known only to the pisj
mies. These little folks determined to kill
the strong man, so one day when he was
asleep in his boat they pelted him with fir
cones till he died. When the tempest rages
through the forest and the branches of the
trees creak and groan and split it is i-aid that
Kwasind is gathering firewood. LongfeDow in
Hiawatha says:
Dear, too, nnto Hiawatha
Was the very strong man Kwasind;
He the strongest of all mortals.

SEMI-OFFICIAL
COUNT OF VOTES
What the Returns Show
at the Registrar's
Office.
The Successful Candidates lor
Municipal 0 fices Are
Announced.
ONE RECOUNT IS DEMANDED.
It Is Bdieved That the Official Count
Will Not Change the Results
Materially.
From an early hour yesterday morninc
until after midnight hundreds of anxious
politicians crowded about the Registrar's
office to learn the result of the semi-official
count of municipal ballots. Great inter
est was manifested in the lights that were
close, but the accountants were kept so
busy with their work that no information
was given out until near midnight, at
which time a tabulated statement was
issued showing the election of Hebbard,
Cook, Dunne and Hunt as Superior
Judges.
Judge Hebbard received 30,765 votes, be
ing in the lead of all other-. Dunne's
vote was 23,877 and Cook's 23,801, while
Hunt got but 16,898, Murasky crowding
him with 16,065.
It became apparent early in the day that
Broderick had won the fight for Auditor
and Widber that for Treasurer. The clos
est fight was in the Twenty-third Senator
ial District, where Tyrrell came within 23
of defeating Hall. He alleged fraud in the
Thirty-lirst Assembly District and de
manded a recount.
The following officers are seen to be
elected by the semi-official returns, and
while the official count will change the
figures some it will not affect the result:
A. C. Widber is elected Treasurer;
Charles S. Tiiton, Surveyor; Harry T.
Creswell, City an a County Attorney; B.
H.Webster, Superintendent of Schools;
William F. Ambrose, Superintendent of
Streets; J. A. Campbell, Charles T. Con
lan, H. L. Joachim~en and C. A. Low,
Police Judges; 6. C. Groezinger, J.
Barry, Frank H. Kerrigan, G. W. F. Cook
and J. A. Carroll, Justices of the Peace.
Supervisors â First Ward, Lawrence De
vany; Second Ward, Tb'omas H. Has
kins; Third Ward. P. M. Delaney; Fourth
Ward, John H^Sheehan; Fifth Ward, Dr.
Washington Dodge; Seventh Ward, Dr.
TullisA. Rottanzi; Eighth Ward, Thomas
Morton: Ninth Ward. James E. Britt;
Tenth W aru, Edward J. Smith; Eleventh
Ward, Dr. C. A. Clinton; Twelfth Ward,
Thomas W. Rivers.
People complained of the slowness of
tlie nguring. tho ugh the clerks all worked
as fast as possible. There were 259 long
columns of figures to add and nearly 80,
-000 sheets of figures to handle.
It is believed by the Registrar that the
cost of this election wiil exceed 5200.000,
though considerable money was saved in
clerk hire and on bills for rubber stamps.
The bill this year was $172 for stamps,
against $800 for last election.
There was much excitement about 1
o'clock when Deputy Registrar McGlade
rushed into the police office and ordered
warrants for all of the numbers of the
election board from the Thirteenth Pre
cinct of the Thirty-third District. It was
known that they left their headquarters at
9 o'clock, and when four hours had passed
there were prone suspicions of fraud and
the Registrar had visions of foul play.
Uhief Crowley telephoned to Captain
Spillane to put all members of the board
under arrest, but before the captain could
get started out the board appeared. The
explanation ot the delay was that an error
had been commuted the night before by
placing some of the returns in the wrong
envelopes. The board could not open
them until all were present, and the time
was put in hunting for the absent members.
The totals on tae semi-official municipal
count were not finally tabulated until
after 2 o'clocJr. this morning. The figures
complete are as follows:

The little town of Nasso, in Sweden, has
a feminine department 150 strong in its
tire brigade. The water works of the vil
lage consist simply of four great tubs, and
it is the duty of the women "firemen" to
keep these full in case of tire. They stand
in two continuous lines from the tubs to
the lake, about three streets away, one
line passing the full buckets and the other
sending them back.
Deafness is more prevalent in cold than
in warm countries, the ears being sensi
tive to changes of temperature.
EXCITEMENT ON
A STEAM WHALER
A Small Fire on the Nar
whal Nearly Caused
a Stampede.
There Was Oil in the Hold, on
the Wharf and in the
Warehouse.
IT WAS A NAEROW ESCAPE.
Death of Captain Pearne, an 0 d-Time
Master on the Occidental and
Oriental Lin?.
There was considerable excitement on
the steam whaler Narwhal yesterday
morning when it was found she was afire.
The vessel was lying at the Arctic Oil
A Small Fire "Was Discovered in the Engine-Room of the Steam-
Whaler Narwhal Yesterday Morning. It Was Put Out Without
Much Damage Being Done. Had It Gained Headway the Ves
sel and the Arctic Oil Works Would Have Been a Total Loss.
Works, and the inflammable nature of her
cargo made a fire a serious question. An
examination showed that the danger was
underneath the engine-room, and the
firemen were soon at work putting it out.
There was considerable smoke and steam
from the blaze, and the steamer's keelson
was considerably charred, but it did not
take long to subdue the flames.
Had the fire gained any headway there
is no knowing what the loss would have
been. The Narwnal had a considerable
quantity of oil in her hold, and there were
many casks of the same liquid on the oil
company's wharf. In the warehouse is
stored both bone and oil, so had the vessel
once began to bliize there is no telling
where the fire would have stopped.
A cablegram to the Merchants' Ex
change announces the death of Captain
William G. Pearne of tÂ»ie steamer Gaelic
of the Occidental and Oriental line. He
was one of the best-known masters sailing
in and out of San Francis>co, having be^n
in the employ of the company Tor over six
teen years. The Gaelic left ban .Francisco
on July 2 last and went ashore on the
coast of Japan. When near Nagasaki on
a dark night Captain Fearne found him
self in the middle of a fleet of sampans.
He slowed down to avoid disaster, but ran
into one of the small craft. The vessel
was stopped and a boat lowered to search
for the missing Japanese. While this was
going on a strong current took charge of
the slnp, and before headway could be
gained she went on a reef.
It took considerable time and money to
get her off, and when she was finally
docked at Yokohama Captain Pearne was
a sick man. He took his ship to Hong
kong, however, and as soon as she was in
the drydock he took to his bed. Later he
was removed to the hospital, where, iv
spite of every attention, he died.
When the Southern Pacific went into
the Oriental trade it charlered three ves
sels from the White Star line. Captain
Purcell brought out the Gaelic, Captain
Metcaif (now Lloyd's surveyor) the
Oceanic and Captain Myers (now a pilot)
the Belgic. After a few voyages Captain
Purcell resigned and Captain Pearne was
sent out to take his place. Ever since he
filled the onerous position with ereat skill
and judgment, and his death will bs a
distinct los-s to the Occidental and Orien
tal Company. Captain Pearne was nearly
70 years old and leaves a widow and sev
eral grown children, who reside in East
Oakland.

ding tour. The former is from Boston,
and while journeying through the south
ern seas he met Miss Pbenie King in
Honolulu. It was a case of love at first
sight, so when the doctor returned from
Australia on the Monowai he stopped off
at the Hawaiian group and was married.
Mi?s King is the daughter of Captain
King, late of the Hawaiian army.
It was expected that; the remains of
Mis." Kate Field would come up on the
Australia, and an undertaker's wagon was
down to receive the coffin as soon as the
vessel docked. Purser JUcComb. how
ever, knew nothing about'the matter, and
says there was no talk at all in Honolulu
about shipping the body, and that he did
not know what boat it would come up on.
The British ship Gainsborou h that
went on the reef near Diamond Head is
now alongside tho wharf at Honolulu.
She is being patched up, and will then
come to San Francisco for repairs. Nene
of the plates were broken, but many of
the rivets were started, and the vessel
leaked c nsiderably. It will cost many
thousands of dollars to put her in any
thing like repair.
Captain John Worth, vho left the
schooner Jane Gray at Unalaska and
took command of an Indian sealer, re
ports a splendid catch. During the time
he was on the little boat they took 535
skins, and now the Indians want him to
go out again. In a letter to a friend in
this City he writes that all the sealers
want to hunt on the coast, but that the
British Columbia owners have decided to
send all their vessels to Japan, Only one
of the Seattle fleet will go to the Okhotsk
Sea and the others will take Indians and
hunt the Pacific Ocean. There is a de
mand for skilled hunters on the Sound,
and Ross & Hewlett have received instruc
tions to engage at least half a dozen and
send them north on the next steamer.
According to Worth the Indians are
growing rich in the sealing business. Tney
own nearly a dozen boats and there is not
one of them but has done well during the
Dast season.
C. D. Ford, owner of the steamer Point
Arena, has earned the gratitude of the
i dairymen and farmers of Mendocino
County and the produce and commission
merchants of San Francisco. Owing to a
heavy westerly swell the steamer could
not enter Point Arena, but nevertheless
Mr. Ford had her stand on and off until
she could get in and take the sroduce
aboard. It meant a delay of tv;enty-four
hours .'or the steamer, but had she gone
on her wav it would have meant the loss
of a week to the Point Arena farmers. In
consequence of the delay the men on the
steamer will have to work double watch in
order to get away on schedule time to
morrow.
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
decided to put a fogbell on Lombard
street wharf. This will be a great help to
the captains of the Tiburon and Sausalito
ferry-boa ts during the winter months.
Now that winter is here the Harbor
Commissioners are discussing the ques
tion of changing the hours of the wnarf
ingers and collectors and other employes.
Hitherto all and sundry have reported for
duty at 7 o'clock a. m., but cow Commis
sioner Cole thinks a change should be
made. Commissioner Chad bourne is with
him, and the chances are that next w en
a notice will be posted requiring the mek
to report for duty at 8 a. m. until further
orders. Tne change w.ll be welcomed
gladly by the men, who for the last nine
months have been getting up at 5:30 a. m.
GUATEMALA'S BIG FAIR.
The Commercial Bodies of This City
Are Actively Interested.
Secretary J. A. Filcher of the California
State Board of Trade has been making
great effons to make the California ex
hibit at Guatemala a success, and he will
be ably helped by the Chamber of Com
merce and other bodies. The Merchants'

H. W. PHILBROOK
WAS CRITICIZED
Reference to His Charges
Against Justice Har
rison.
Stinging Comment Contained in
a Supreme Court De
cision.
LEVINSON CASE DECIDED.
Action of tbe Lower Court Was
Sustained and Long Litigation
Came to an End.
The Supreme Court yesteiday decided
the case of Ira P. Rankin, administrator
of the estate of John Levinson, deceased,
against William J. Newman. The court
denied the demand for an accounting
and affirmed the judgment of Judge
Wallace in the lower court. This is the
case in which Attorney Horace W. Phil
brook made the attack upon Justice-
Harrison of the Supreme Court, the attack
which led to Mr. Philbrook's disbar
ment. Justice Garoutte wrote the opinion
of the court and Justices McFarland and
Van Fleet concurred therein. A concur
ring opinion was al?o filed by Justices
Beatty, Hcnshuw and Temple. Justice
Harrison did not sit in the case. The
opinion by Justice Garouite was com
paratively brief. The well-known history
of the somewhat famous case was reviewed.
Incidentally \he charge of fraud made by
Attorney Pnilbrook was touched upon and
justice Garoutte found that '-any ques
tion of fraud is out of the case." Again
he found that '"ii this transfer of the part
nership be set aside, as is hera sought by
the appellant, and all parties be placed in
statu quo, as of the day the transaction
was had, no substantial resulis favorable
to appellants' interests would ensue. It
would be a valueless victory, for, as said
by the trial judge, upon au accounting the
sum realized by the legatees would tall far
short of the amount actually paid by the
surviving parties to tliem."
Justice Garoutte also expressed the
opinion that the goodwill of the business
passed to tho surviving partners.
In the concurring opinion considerabie
attention was devoted to Mr. Fhilbrook's
charges against Justice Harrison. The
assumption that the Newmans were con
traciing with the expectation that they
would be the survivors was not urged, it
was pointed out, \ Defore the trial court.
There was no 'reason to suppose when the
contract was made that Levinson's illness
was mortal. He lived more than one year
thereafter, beine a portion of that time
unable to attend to business.
Mr. Philbrook's argument was alluded
to as vehement and intemperate. It was
also found that during the time Harrison
was acting as attorney lor Executor Rav
ely nev r was there the slightest hint or
suggestion to the effect, that thÃ partner

or that Levinson at the time he signed
them was mentally incapacitated or sub

Concerning the conspiracy alleged by
Phil brook the court said :
"As to the fact that Mr. Harrison, after
his nomination, continued to advise the
first executor, Ravely, in a matter in
which he had been employea long before
his nomination, and the further fact that
he drew up and witnessed the papers
which passed upon the settlement, it
seems scarcely credible that a normal
mind could regard them as evidences of
fraud or as an attempt to corruptly influ
ence the decision of this court But it is
out of these simple circumstances that
Mr. Philbrook has construed his elaborate
theoiy of fraud and corruption. The
truth is there is not only no fouudation
for the argument upon this point, but the
fact which it seeks to establish is totally
irrelevant."

TREACHERY FOOL
AND UNNATURAL
Treason of M. H. de Young
and What Came
of It.
Dragged Down His Own Politi
cal Followers to Dis
aster.
RUINED BY SPITE WORK
Gainblmg With National Honor to
Carry Out His Own Selfish
and Sin ster Ends.
On every side, among foremost Repub
licans of Ban Francisco, accusations of
treason to the Republican party have
been aimed at M. H. de Young and his
Chromcle. One week ago the streets re
sounded to the tramp of marching tnou
sands of Republicans and to their inspir
iting and spontaneous cheers for the
grand standard-bearers of the party; the
apostles of patriotism ana protection; the
advance agents of prosperity.
Thousands upon thousands of spectators
watched the magnificent and emblemati
cal pageant as it moved along Market
street. Never in the history of the City
had enthusiasm run higher.
Never had there been since the dawn of
Republicanism in the City by the Golden
Gate greater reason to expect that San
fmncisco was about to demonstrate to
the people of the United States that it
could always be counted upon to rise as
an undivided and loyal community in
times of emergency in support of true
Americanism. But even while the hosts
were still marching M. H. de Young re
tired to his office and resumed his deadly
work which was destined to jeopardize
Republican National success in San Fran
cisco.
There spitting venom and filled with
spite because his measure had been accu
rately taken by the knowing ones, he
cabaled and plotted and discussed coolly
the proposition to saciitice San Francisco
on the altar of his greed.
Innuendo, insinuation, false promises of
political plunder, bargains, jobs and chi
canery were not too raw. The stake was
vengeance upon uioae who had received
the nominations for position from the
only convention of Republicans in San
Francisco that was entitled to assume the
name.
So election day came. Tbe plot which
threatened the integrity of the party on
the National issue was ripe and was en
trusted to lieutenants bold and unscrupu
lous. Everything was for sale in the way
of votes in exchange for spite work against
the reeular Republican nominees.
The snowing that San Francisco made
as a great Republican ciiy was not what it
ought to have been; not what it would
have been, but for De Young and his co
conspirators. Instead of a majority of
thousands for McKinley and Ho bbatr t the
shame of having the City go ttgainst the
Republican party on the National ticket
was very narrowly escaped.
Out in tbe Mission, last evening, was
found Cord H. Wetjen, candidate on tbe
regular Republican ticket for the position
of Tax Collector. Mr. Wetjen made a
gallant hght lor ihe success ol the Repub
lican party. In. the Democratic districts
he held the adverse vote down success
fully. In the Republican districts he en
countered, as other candidates on the reg
ular Republican ticket, the sinister influ
ence of De Young's scheme, which was
being forced through without scruple or
conscience.
"There is no doubt," said Mr. Wetjen at
bis residence last evening, "that the split
in the^Re publican party was what defeated
me. Back of it was AL H. de Young, who
surely cannot have gained any ereat
political advantage by what he has done.
His faction* were out lor spite work.
They were ready to sell off anything to
carry out their purpose. They put the
National ticket in danger. De Young did
not help the Republican party. Not
much !"
Thomas G. Walkington, candidate of
the regular Reuuohcan party fur Super
visor from the Filth Ward, was found last
evening to entertain very decided views
concerning the split in tiie party, which
was engineered by M. H. de Young. "My
opinion is," said Mr. Walkington, "that
if it had not been for the split the Repub
lican electoral ticket would nave gone out
of San Francisco with a majority of from
4000 to 5000 to its credit/
"My defeat," said D. W. Wes3enberg,
regular Republican candidate for Super
visor in the Second Ward, ''was due
wholly to the candidacy of Jeremiah
Browell on the CitizeDs' Republican
ticket. Mr. Browell is a man whom I
have known a long time, and for whom I
have a great deal of respect. Tne only
fault I nave to find with aim is for per
mitting himself to be made the tool of the
Kelly-Mahoney faction.
"I polka over 18,000. votes and Browell
5000. If I had reci-lven half the votes
given to him I would undoubtedly have
been elected. If the Chronicle bad not
lent its influence to the Keliy-Mahoney
crowa they would have none to pieces.
M. H. de Young is the one man on whom
every defeated candidate should lay the
blame of his failure to be elected."
Judge A. B. Treadwell is one of the
regular Republican candidates who owes
his deleut 10 the Kelly-Mahoney gang of
political hucksters and the proprietor of
the Chronicle. Though Tread well is
strong in his denunciation of Kelly and
Malioney, he will not converse regarding
De Young on the score of personal friend
ship for the editor.
"The regular Republicans nominated
me and the other three who have won
out," he said, "and the Ciiiz-ns' Republi
cans Indorsed every man dv: me. This
wus due to the fact that about seven
months ago 1 made a speech denouncing
rhe Kelly-Mahoney gang as a political
ting that had cliqued together to defeat
the party. â¢
"1 further said they had no authority to
call a convention, because they had no
standing under the law. For ihis they
put up Forbes against me. He polled
about 5500 votes and I was defeated by 1000.
"So, you see, 1 had nobody to thank for
my defeat but the <Â«ng ol political ruf
fians who pose as followers of Kelly and
Mahoney. Their complete failure to elect
any candidate of importance shows how
such reprehensible methods are re
warded."
Similar views were expressed by other
prominent Republicans, who did not care
to be quoted lor fear of tbe De Young
vengeance.
STUDENTS OF THE DRAMA.
A Number of Columbia School Pupils
Stake Their Debute.
The eighth public performance of the
Columbia School of Dramatic Art, given
yesterday afternoon in the Columbia The
ater, was in many respects a most success
ful one, though most of the ladies and
gentlemen who took part â¢in tbe first two'
pieces were too nervously anxious to act,
and to get through their parts,' and did
not take sufficient care to make them
selves heard and understood. H. E. de
L.asaux and C. Page were exceptions,
however.
"Come Here" was very well rendered.
Miss Pearl Berry, besides having a good
stage presence, enunciated clearly and did
not overact.
"A Knight of the Lost Cause" was a
very pretty little drama, well conceived
and weil rendered. Colonel Philip Farley
could hardly nave been in better handsâ
S. S. Simons. He not oniy looked like a
worn-out Confederate soldier, but he acted
the part perfectly. Miss Loretta Grace
and Miss Freda Gallick also deserve high
encomiums. In the final piece, "The
Dummy," all those who took part ac
quitted themselves very creditably. Miss
H. Neilson made a charming ingenue,
while the maiden sisters seemed to appre
ciate their pans. The tardy lover was
well represented by G. B. Connor, and A.
Y. Morrison made a bright young lover to
the new maid.
The dancing was the weak feature in
the programme. It was too mechanical
and the style of dress was inappropriate.
The Spanish costume was pretty, bat in
Spanish dancing there should be no high
kicking.
Enormous Sale of Stamps.
The receipts from the gale of stamps during
October exceeded that of any previous month
in the history of the local Postoffice. This is
attributed solely to the enormous amount of
mail matter sent out by the politicians during
the last thirty days of the campaign. The
sales irom Rtnmps reached $85,000, the beat
previous month beiug $78,000. So ?re at was
the rush of mail niatler thai Postmaster Mc-
Coppin found it necessary to employ twenty
extra carriers^
HILBORN DID NOT SIGN,
Board of Trade in a Quandary
Regarding tbe Tidal Canal
Compromise
A Presumption That the Bone of
Contention Figured in tbe Recent
Congressional Fight
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Nov. 5. j
Tne committee of tbe Board of Trade of
Oakland that has in charge the manner of
attempting to adjust the tidal canal diffi
culty is wondering just now whether or
not Congressman Hilborn has played
them a trick.
A weefc ago the compromise committee
of the Alameda Trustees and the Board of
Trade signed an agreement unanimously.
This agreement was taken by the Board
of Trade to Mr. Hilborn with a request
that he sign it. After reading it through
he replied. "Certainly I will" and at once
grasped a pen.
The Congressman wrote the words "I
approve the above," then he stopped sud
denly anil remarked: "This is not exactly
right; Benator Perkins should sign first."
H. O. Trowbridge, who was present,
suggested that Mr. Hilborn leave a little
space for the Senator's name and attach
his own. But this Mr. Hilborn refused to
do. He said that if Mr. Perkins could be
found it would be all right, but when the
telephone brought the information that
Mr. Perkins was in the interior of the
State Mr. Hilborn steadily refused to sigu
the document.
The day after election came the infor
mation from Alameda that they withdrew
from the acreeraent. Now tne Board of
Trade wonders whether Mr. Hilborn was
aware of the position in Alameda when he
refused to sign, and maintained the friend
ship of both sides of the estuary until
after election by a display of finesse.
Certain it is that the Board of Trade is
very much disappointed that Mr. Hil
born's signature was not on the agreement
belore it was repudiated, and they are
anxious to know the reason.
LITTLE ONES BENEFITED
Success. ul Entertainment in Aid
ot the Emergency

A Musicale, a Fortune-Telling Booth

To Mrs. John Pettee belongs all tne
honors of the successful entertainment
given last evening, at her home, 2505
Leavenworth street, in aid of the fund for
the Emergency Hosnital. The idea of an
emergency Hospital for children origi
nated with Mrs. Pettee, and it did not
take that worthy Jady long to interest the
Mrs. John Pettee, Who Invites the

public, the press and rnaritable organiza
tions as well in the noble work she had
undertaken.
The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children immediately co-op
erated with Mrs. Pettee in the worthy
cause, and the ladies of the Children's
Hospital were not slow in coming to the
front in aid of the charity.
The sum realized by last evening's en
tertaintr.ent is to be utilized in the pur
chase of a downtown hospital, where suf
fering little ones will receive immediate
attention.
Mr*. Pettee kindly placed her lovely
home on Leavenworth street at the dis
posal of those interested in the noble
work. Drawme-roora, reception hall
music-room, dining-room and uitting
room were all thrown open to the kindly
disposed public There was no attempt at
elaborate decorations, but there was a pro
fusion of choice and fragrant flowers
everywhere. At the bountifully laden
tables pretty girls dispensed dainties.
Then there was tbe grab-ba? in charge of
Maudie Pettee that did a land-office busi
ness, and Miss Welch sold boutonnieres by
the dozens. Another great attraction was
the fortune telling booth.
During the evening a musical pro
gramme was rendered under the able di
rection of Professor McKenzie.

A crowded house greeted Ferris Hart

in large numbers; they were also repre
sented by magnificent floral tributes and
by a fine gold badge of their order, which
John J. Rnffael presented with a neat
speech to the comedian ouring the second
act of "The BaDes in the Wood."
"I have a little surprise here for our
fellow-elk," said Mr. Raffael. "I have
been requested by our /riends to present
you with this badge as a token of our
esteem," and he pinned the baJge to the
comedian's coat amid great app.iause. The
stage was soon heaped with floral tributes,
and Mr. Hartman, being called on for a
speech said: "There are moments in one's
life when the tongue fails, moments when
one wants to be alone; this is not one of
them, however, for one never wants to be
alone on a benefit night. I can only say
that I appreciate your appreciation of me
and thank you with ray whole heart."
AT THE ALCAZAR.
A Successful Production of "Love on
Crutches."
A pretty performance of "Love on
Crutches" is being given at the Alcazar
this week. As usual dainty May Buckley
is carrying away a large share of the lau
rels, though the rest of the company is
doing good work.
Beatrice Liebe is giving an intelligent
rendering of the role of the jealous wife,
and John T. Sullivan is crood as her hus
band. Mrs. Bates takes the role ot the
shrew cleverly. Polk is doing excellent
work.
"Love on Crutches" is excellently staged
and costumed.

LIZZIE JOHNSON'S
SAD LIFE STORY
She Seeks Refuge From
Trouble in an Insane
Asylum.
Was There Before and Saw Her
Only Happy Days While
Imprisoned,
SOUGHT WORK BUT FAILED.
While in a Frenzy of Desperation
The Stabbed a Woman Who
Jostled Her.
The advice of the wag who suggested
that people tell their troubles to a police
man is tasen oftener than most people
suppose.
Lizzie Johnson is the latest San Fran
ciscan to profit by it. Ever since she can
remember hard knoclcs have been Lizzie's
portion. Disappointment seems to hava
selected her for a companion and ill for
tune co have claimed her as its own. De
serted by those who should have cared for
her, insulted by those who shoula have
shielded her, rebuffed when she sought
ho est employment, she has grown tired
of trying, and heartsick seeks a refuge at
the hands of the State. "Sweet liberty"
is to her an unmeaning phrase. The
future holds in store no alluring prospect,
and tbe fondest hope of Lizzie Johnson is
that she may be allowed to end her days
sheltered by the walls of an insane asylum
and free from the necessity of wresting a
livi ng from a grudging world.
Mrs. Jo: nson is not insane, she says,
although she was once the inmate of an
asylum. The recollection cf tne days she
spent there ia the one bright spot in her
memories uf recent happenings. That she
did not act upon the advice of tne super
intendent, who warned her that she would
be better off did she remain, she ia ex
tremely sorry.
"He told me that people would not give
me work and that I would rind life
mighty hard in San Francisco when I got
bueic," said she yesterday. "He knew
what he was talking about, too. 1 am a
dressmaker, and, although not an expert
at my trade, I am a lirsi-class waist
finisher, and could earn a good iiving
could 1 only get the opportunity.
"It's mighty hard, though. If I've
asked one person for work I've asked 200,
but they all say there's nothing for me.
And some of them laugh when they say
there's a dozen women a day around look
ing for work and that most of them are
tirst-ciass hands.
"I'm a kind of an actress, too. In my
younger days, when I was not so heavy
as I am now, I played at several of the
theaters here. I was never any leading
lady, but I could earn enough te keep me
from going hungry. I guess I could fill
up in the extras now, if they would trive
me a chance. But they won't. I'm "not
stage-struck and I don't think I'm a sec
ond Fanny Davenport; all I want is to
earn an honest living. But, then, there's
plenty of slender, young and pretty giri*
who are looking for that sortot work, ana
none of the managers can find any room
for me.
"A couple of years ago I was walking in
Golden Gate Â±>ark one afternoon. My
clothes were not fashionable, and maybe
1 looked out of place among all the pretty
women and children out there, but I
wasn't bothering anybody. I thought
that even a person as poor as I was en
titled to a breath of fresh air and a glance
at God's green country, but as I passed a
bench on which two women sat watching
their children at play, one of them made
a remark that stirred me all up. I wasn't
feeling particularly t'ood-tempered any
how. I had been seeking work that morn
ing and had beard the same old 'no,' time
and time again.
"I turned on that woman and, though
she said she didn't mean the remark to
apply to me, I couldn't believe it. I went
away, however, but a few steps farther
I brushed into another woman. Before I
knew what had happened 1 had pulled a
pair of scissors from my pocket and
stabbed her. They arrested me and the
Judge said it was an insane act. I never 1
saw tne woman before, and they said I
had no reason to attack ncr and so I must
be crazy, and they sent me to the asylum.
'â¢I want to co back. I made a big mis
take when I left. Tie superintendent said
that 1 was cured and that I could go if I
wanted to, but that I had better stay. It's
the best place for me. They don't seem
to have any use for me in San Francisco,
and I'm so sick of trying that I'm afraid
that if I keep on I might get another one
of tho-e spells and hurt somebody else."
Mrs. John-on will be examined by the
Insanity Commissioners to-day.A BRIEF ANALYSIS
OF THE CITY VOTE
OveF-Ambitious Politicians
â :\- Severely Rebuked
by Voters.
. Lauineister and D:mond Have
'â¢â  an. Unpleasant Taste of
â¢'. . Public Disfavor.
JvON-r>AKTISANS ARE PLEASED.
..Many cf Their Candidates Successfa
.* .- at the Polls-Rdaey Has the
Supervisors.
â¢â¢ 'An analysis ol the vote cast in this City
rJveaJs >ome surprises, not the least grati
fying, of which is the subsidence of popu
"fcir support for a certain class of perennial
candidates who have arrogated to them
= selves the risht to ruin if they cannot rule.
This applies to both the Republican and
the Democratic parties and is particularly
illustrated in the race for the mayoralty.
."Mr. Lauineister, the bolting Republican
1 candidate for Mayor, is a gentleman of
I FK>d character in all bia pnvute and per
\eooal relations, but it was lelt even by his
friends that he had transgressed the ethics
0.1 political iife by going into the tield
against the regular nominee of his party
; at such a time as the campaign just closed.
This sentiment was deepened by the fact
that Mr. Laumeister had been honored by
bis party with the most lucrative office in
the Eift of the people of the municipality,
and it was deemed that ordinary gratitude
ougiit to have kept him from such an act
. of treachery. Mr. Laumeister and his or
gan, tue Chronicle, made so many loud
boas'.s of strength that come timid Re
publicans became apprehensive that he
mignt win, aud in order to rebuke him
and- to make hia success out of the ques
tion they left their own party lines and
. cast their votes for Mr. Pnelan, thus
d6ubiy robbing Colonel C. L. Taylor, the
regular Republican nominee, who was en
titled to the support of all good citizens.
Mr. Laumeister'b sivall vote ought to
. teach him and ail such office-seekers a les
son that will be of benefit to them and the
community.
Mr. Dimond, the nominee of the Buck
ley Democrats, is also a wiser and sadder
m.an. one has a vtord to say against
his private character, nor is there any ob
jection to be urged against his record as a
Supervisor. He is an honorable ten tie
man in all the relations of life, yet the
pitiful showing that he makes in the race
for Mayor shows what the people think of
a bolter who is trying to defeat the iegiti*
mate desires of his own party as expressed
in a legally organized convention, it is
another ease of vaulting ambition that
ends in disaster and disappointment,
cloudine the political posaib.iities of a life
that otherwise might have contributed
something of value to the community.
As predicted by The Call, Dr. C. C.
O'Donnell proved to be "a back number,"
for he comes in almost at the end of the
procession, being ahead of only one can
didate,.Mr. .Everrett, who made no pre
tense ot strength outside of th=* ranks of
the Socialist-Labor party, which he repre
sents.
The Citizens' Non-Partisan managers
feei pleased with the result. The regard
the victory of Judge Hebbard a? an in
dorsement of their plan of campaign, for
Judge Hebbard had no nomination except
theirs. Modesty forbids them to bace
their strength on Judge Hebbard's vote,
however. The cry was raised that some of
the big corporations were righting him,
and, whether true or not, the story nad
its effect on the voter 3.
O. those who were indorsed by the Citi
zens' Non-Partisan party the following
were successful: J. D. Phelan, Mayor;
William Broderick, Auditor; James M.
Block, Tai Collector; A. C. Widber, Treas
urer; Henry T. Creswell, City Attorney;
â Jo.ii n Hunt and J. C. Hebbard, Judges ot
ihe Superior Court; C. T. Conlan, H. L.
.Touch imscn and C. A. Low, Judges of the
Police Court; J. E. .Barry and F. H. Ker
rigan, Justices of the Peace; Lawrence
Devany, Washington Dodge, John Lack-
R. H. Webster, Super
lent of Schools.
The Non-Partisans also indorsed several
ative nominees who were elected.
It is remarkable that the Buckley Dem
ocrats made so shaft a showing after ail
luz noise in wnicti they indulged. Atone
meeting at Metropolitan Temple a few
days before the election the hali was
crowded with enthusiastic howlers, and it
was 'confidently asserted that the crowd
contained more voters than appear to have
cast their ballots for Mr. Dimond or Mr.
Strother. It is plain that upon sober sec
ond thought they changed their alliance
to -Mr. Puelan.
The Prohibition party seems to have
dropped alnio.-t out of sight, and it looks
as if they will have to file a petition if
they want to get on the blanket ticket at
the next election.
â¢The gold Democrats cut a sorry figure
. as Â»vas generally expected, though it was
thought that more of them would take the
trouble to vote for Mr. Palmer. The so
called National party also has a very small
vote..
â  Just- where the Populists are going to
get off nobody seems to know. Their
fusion with the Democrats leaves them in
as!range predicament. So far as can be
â judged the Populists have been owallowed
Dy the Democratic party, and it wiil be
1 d fficult for them to again assume the po
sition of an independent organization.
In any event the Populists have sacrificed
' the confidence and respect of the public to
â¢a hope for a portion of the public pap. It
is believed that when tne apportionment
of'patronage is made very few Popuiists
will, be found anywhere near the pie
counter.
An important fact considered locally is
that Sam Rainey bas control of the ma
â¢ jority of the Board of Supervisors. It
looks as if Bu kley had lost his last errip
on municipal politics in San Francisco,
unless be and his henchmen are able to
beguile some of the successful Democratic
candidates from their allegiance to Rainey.
There is always the suspicion, of course,
that Rainey and Buckley are secretly in
partnership, and in this connection the
people of the community on account of
bitter past experience have good reason to
fear* the facility with which those well
known Dosses ac able to practice the old
rule of "audition, division and silence."
LIABILITY OF MEMBERS.
Corporation Men Must Fay Their Share
of the Concern's Debts.
the case of Mary C. Bayden vs. W. A.
Vigoureux and others was yesterday de
cided by Judee Murphy in favor of the
plaintiff, thereby affirming the decision
previously rendered by Judge Harry in the
Justices' Court.
The case is of considerable importance
to members of mutual life insurance com
panies incorporated under the laws ol
this State, as it sustains the validity ol
the*tatute dt-claringthe t ersonal liability

debts and liabilities ot < on. oration*.
In this case the plaintiff's clÂ«im of (2000
against the Fraternal Life Association.
formerly Jcaowu as tUe Masonic Mutual
Aid Association, being unpaid, and there
being no assets of the corporation in sight,
she had recourse to the members. Know
ina that there were about $12,000 other
death claims against the corporation,
they vigorously resisted payment, and
several of them united in the defense ol
the. above action as a test ca&e.
HAINQUE WAS CRUEL
His Wife Says He Choked Her and
Then Beat Hor Into Insen
sibility.
Acnes M. Hainque has filed a new suit
for divorce against Martial Hainque Jr.,
son of the owner of the Cyclops Machine
Works, who died several years ago, leav
ing an estate valued at over $100,000.
Mrs. Hainque first instituted suit in Feb
ruary last, but yesterday dismissed the
original action and began a new one. She
charges that her husband has beaten her
lime and again, and that be stood oy and
encouraged his sister, Mrs. Frank C.
Bangs, to do likewise.
Trie Hainques were married March 30,
1893, and the complaint recites that before
six months had elapsed the husband, one
evening, while on ihe way home from a
visit to his sister, became enraped and
struck the plaintiff, causing blood to How
from her nose. The next day he resumed
his attack, and but for the arrival of Mme.
Rosine Guitair would have again beaten
her.
It is further recited that in January,
1894, Hainque struck his wife with his
clenched fist several times, and when he
grew tired of administering punishment
in that manner seized her by her hair and
dragged her about the room. A month
later he beat and choked her, threw ht'r

the temple by the missiles and severely
injured.
Numerous other instances of cruelty are
alleged, the whole culminating in Janu
ary, 1896, when Hainque encouraged his
sister to assault his wile.
Mrs. Hainque claims that her husband
ia the owner of property worth *over |25,
-000 and asks for a decree of divorce, the
custody of the two-year-old child and $125
per month alimony.
NO JOY FOR DEMOCRATS,
Still Hope Has Net Yet Entirely
Forsaken Their Lead
ers.
At the headquarters of the Democratic
State Campaign Committee, in the Cali
fornia Hotel, last night, a sDow of hopeful
ness was still maintained despite the dis
heartening reports of the day. Every
man connected with the headquarters had
his own theory for figuring out a possible
victory for Mr. Bryan, and though it was
noticed that all seemed to rely on what
they termed "the doubtful States of Indi
ana, Michigan and California" yet the
combinations with other "doubtful" or
"disputed" States were as complicated
and almost as numerous as would Le pos
sible with the old fashioned 13 14-15 puzzle.
Ch airman Alford said he was not in a
mooa for discussing the situation, though
he had not lost hope. Secretary EL. P.
Tioy and Assistant Secretary Al McCabe
joined in this sentiment, and showed
plenty of statistics from former elections
to justify their position. Apparently they
did not tase into account the changed
conditions and issues of the campaign just
ended.
N. M. Miller, secretary of the campaign
literary bureau, and J. W. Kelly, Ms as
sistant, were unabie to comprehend how
tne people of a State who bad been bom
barded with broadsides of Mr. Bryan's
speeches could so far forget themselves as
to yield a majority to Mr. McKinley, yet
so it seemed to be.
Tnomas P. Ward, the campaign
committee's official stenographer, was
kept busy replying to tele. rams from
the East asking for definite information
as to bow California has gone. Chairman
Jones of the National Democratic Com
mittee wa* very peremptory. He said it
was necessary for the committee to have
immediate information in regard to the
totalizing of the Democratic and Populist
vote for Bryan, and as to the final r>suh.
C. airman Aliord considered this as an
important aud favorable symptom, as he
Argued that no anxiety would be mani
fesied touching California unless the out
come of the election seemed to depend on
the electoral vote of this State.
It seems probable that only the official
count will convince the tenacious Demo
crats of California that their favorite has
been defeated in his aspiration to occupy
the White House.

THOSE WHO FOUGHT
FOR SUFFRAGE
The Annual Convention of
the State Associa
tion.
Credit Given to the State News
papers, Excepting the
"Chronicle."
THEY ARE HOT CAST DOWN.
Consider They Have Won a Victory
in the Great Vote Polled for
Th?m
The women who have been in the front
of the battle for suffrage in this State are
anything but cast down by the result of
Tuesday's election.
At the annual convention of the State
Suffrage Association assembled in Golden
Gate Hall Saturday nearly every speaker
referring to the subject at all did so in the
tone of congratulation and satisfaction.
Miss Anthony especially expressed grat
ification at the result, and Mrs. Ida Har
per, chairman of the press committee,
Btronely seconded her.
"We from the East who came to work
with you through the campaign will take
the train next Saturday and return
home," said Miss Anthony, "and we will
do so with no feeling of disappointment
whatever on the result. Quite the con
trary,
"The fact that such a large number of
votes were cast for the amendment is in
dication of a great stride toward the
emancipation of woman in California.
You must remember tint this matter has
been discussed in this State but little.
The only reason for its failure now is
ignorance â a lack of confidence in the
very fundamental principle of the repub
lic itself. But no such work of education
has ceen accomplished anywhere in any
like period of time â a mere little eight
months. Down iv my country, in the
East, we have been wurking and agitatinz
for many years, going before the Legisla
ture session after session and to political
conventions with the same regularity
with whu-h they are called, aud we have
not yet got suffrage.
"You see, we have a great many new
people to educate down tuere. The thou
sands of newcomers that are year after
year brought in from other "countries
wholly unable to comprehenu the spirit ol
our institutions â they form our obstacle â
so we have about given up hope of storm
ing those citadels, and must wait for you
of the West to work the reform. You have
done excellently well, Â» nd it only re
mains for you io keep at work, to educate
and educate and vÂ»e will shortly win.
'â¢I have to say that very much of the
credit of this great work belongs to women
whose names we never heard, whom we
never see â those noble, loyal women who
have labored in their own districts among
their neighbors. Ihey have accomplished
much."
Golden Gate Hall was filled by the
delegates to the convention and friends of
the c-iuse. By vote, it was decided to give
representation to every Ciub or organiza
tion mi th" State bailing from places where
there was no regular county representa
tion.
An additional delegate was allowed for
every iwenty-rive members in excess of
tweuiy-five in every c.ub or organization.
Mrs. McCann of fc-anta Cruz became a
delegate by this action, and was warmly
applauded when she arose to speak,
coming as fttM d.d. ami as sne proudly said
she did, irom '"a county that carried for
suffrage."
The president's, secretary's and treas
urer's reports were read for the year.
Aiameda County was reported as having
the largest suffrage club, numbering over
300. The treasurer reported a credit in
the bank ol nearly $300.
The routine business of the convention
being disposed of Mrs. Ida Harper, chair
man oi the jire.-s committee, was called
upon lor a report of ihe work. She said
that though her pen nad scarcely been
out of her hands lor these eight months
past, she had not prepared a report as yet,
but would talk about it.
"When Miss Anthony first came here to
direct thiscampuigii," she said, "I offered
myself lor her disposal. I had known
her many years; 1 had been aiway? ready
to do what 1 could in the cause ol suffrage
and now stood ready to obey her orders.
Bhp immediately put me in charge ol the
press committee. We called upon the
proprietors and editors of all the news
papers and met with a most cord. a! re
ception at their hand* without excei tion.
They said they would give U3 wnat aid
they could, and that tney would not op
pose us in any way. Tney have all kept
their words and have treat d us and our
I cause with great liberality."
A voice: "Did not the Chronicle on the
illuming of the eleciion and for several
mornings before that come out distinctly
aeamst us, advising its readers to vote no
with regard to the sixth amendment?"
"Yes, it did. I, of course, meant to
note that exception. It did that not only
once, but very often. The_Â£hronicle never
declared for suffrage. It is a remarkable
fiict that only two papers in the State
came out against suffrage, one beine the
San Francisco Cl ronicle ant the other
the I<os Angeles Times. The Times op
posed as from the first, and, by the way,
Los Angeles County is one of the counties
that went strongly for suffrage. My faith
in the power of the press is somewhat
ohaken. In Aiameda County, which went
against suffrage, there were nine news
papers, every one of which favored our
cause. Had I judged from themani their
good offices I would have said we cm!d
not fail. I have to say that the news
papers have done their duty."
Mrs. McCann here moved that a rising
vote of thanks be offered the newspapers
of California that had so bravely stood for
the enfranchisement of wunn-n. Mrs.
Harper seconded the motion and every
woman m the crowded hall rose to her
leet.
"When we consider," continued Mrs.
Harper, "that every newspaper in the
State could have made money by opposing
vs â for our enemies had plenty of money
and were wiilin to spend itâ we can better
appreciate their action. When they â our
special enemies â were organized and en
tered upon an aggressive tight against us,
I was prepared to s*-e a change of front in
many of the newspapers, but I was very
agreeably disappointed.
'â¢I can say from knowledge that the
newspapers were not influenced by the
money of the opposition. They remained
true to their first declarations of principle
to us. More than that, they gave us all
the space we asked for. They not even
charged us for notices of our meetinas.
In spite of this I never considered a news
paper a friend of our cause unless it satd
so editorially. From tha opening of the
campaign until the close no less than 300
newspapers did this. Witiiin two weeks
of the election sixteen joined our ranks.
On. yes. the newspapers have done tneir
part indeed."
Mrs. A. A. Sargent, presidtnt, paid a
high tribute to Miss Anthony. "At 76
years oi age," she said, "this noble
woman has given her tima, spent money
out of her purse, traveled up and down
the State speaKing and writing and di
recting the work, robbed of sleep and
working tirelessly."
Tha convention applauded lohg and
loud. Miss Anthony, silting next the
president, merely smiled and nodded.
Recording Secretary Mrs. Harland here
paid a tribute to Mrs. Sargent and her
tireless work, hospitality and liberality
through the campaign.
Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway, president of
the Oregon State Suffrage Association, was
introduced and spoke a few words of en
couragement to the Calitorniii workers.
The following committees were an
nounced for the convention and for con
tinuing the work:
Committee on credentialsâ Mrs. Sperry, Dr.
Elisabeth Sargent, Mrs. Martin.
Plan of workâ Mrs. Green, Mrs. Blinn, Mrs,
Wood, Mr s . Carr.
Resolutions â Mrs. Ida Harper, Mrs. Rev.
Eliza Tupper Wilkes, Dr. Ida Siambacli of
Santa Barbara, Mrs. Juage Cotton and Mrs.
Ada Van Peit.
Courtesies-Mrs. Lovell White, Mrs. William
Keith of Santa Cruz.
The convention adjourned until this
morning.
Last evening a reception was given to
Miss Anthony by the lsdies of the State
association at Golden Gate Hall. It was
a successtul and gratifying affair to all
of the throng that attended. It was in
tendea only to be a social gathering, giv
ing Miss Anthony's friends and admirers
a chance to meet her informally and to
tell her of how they appreciated her sacri
fice of time and personal convenience in
their behalf.
However, the evening was not far ad
vanced before they had called her to the
platform, and the veteran of many cam
paigns related something of her experience
here and bade them be of good cheer.
Miss Mary G. Hay was called for and
then Miss Shaw, both making short ad
drf sses.
Mr-i. Nellie Holbrook-Blinn, as chair
man, also made a few remarks, reminding
all of the raily to take place at Metropoli
tan Temple this evening, the last demon
stration of the campaign.
A PLUMBER'S DOWNFALL.
Charles Clifford Una Four Charges of
IJui g!:iry I'laced Against Him.
Charles Clifford, a victim of the mor
phine habit, was detained yesterday at the
City Prison by Policeman T. F. Burke on
four charges of burglary.
Clifford is a plumber by occupation, and
for the past two months has been going
about the Southern district, carrying with
him some plumber's tools, looking for
vacant houses. He would apply for the
key, representing that he had been sent by
the agent to do some repairs in the vacant
house and, it is alleged, would remove tne
faucets, cut off the lead pipe and other
material and sell them to satisfy his crav
ing for the drug.

rniCAGO. 111. Nov. 5 The weakness which
! assailed wheat prices at the close yesterday was
influential as a factor at Liverpool tbls morning
and, finding that no resistance was offered to
the declining trend, in turn grew weaker still.
Wheat was for sale in liberal quantities this
morning, and as short sellers have oeen strangers
to the market for a long time the absence of tbe
demand which would naturally be afforded by
1 hem was palpable. Hence values slipped down
ward with li. tie opposition. Receipts in the
Korthwe t sho.v a fa ling off, sometiii.ig that has
been expected v q,n â  a wh.le. They amouui d
I to Â»44 cars, sea 113 1221 lasi Tburs ay ana 1 135

I from 75c to 77% c and closed at about 75, .-c to

) CORNâ The corn market evinced no unwilling- t
1 ness to join wheat on the descending scsie as
any strength noted in the u.arket was a gift from
1 the finer grain, it was only reasonable that weak- !
ness siiould ii.id ready acqu.escence. Liverpool
was It d lower. Receipts were 719 cars. 44 more
, than expected. The Cincinnati Price Current re

908 Broadway, November 5. )
Alameda County proudly claims that
' she saved California for McKinley.
Nexf Saturday night this fact will be
emphasized in a manner that is Intended
' to so completely paralyze any future effort
to promote Bryanlsm and ita attendant
evils that their so-called party will never
be .resurrected in this county.
* / The executive committees and commit
>^^es of citizens were appointed to-day to
jnake arrangements to illuminate the city
for the occasion. It is intended by the
thousands of railroad employes in town
to thoroughly demonstrate their opinion
regarding the charges of "coercion" that
were so freely made prior to election. The
.maddest men in town are these railroad
employes. They have stood around the
bulletin board in tbeir spare hours for two
days freely expressing their opinion of
those who talked "coercion," and on Satur
day night their lection of the parade will
"figure as "the great coerced."
Although the candidate for Supervisor
- from the railroad district might have
â  made a worse record during his past term
he was loaded down with so much favor
by the "'coercing;" press that he sank out
â¢ of sight. By himself Pelouze might have
won out, but with the aid of his friends,
â¢who attempted to attain some cueap glory
by-trying to procure his election, he only
made a bad second, aud the regular Re
,â¢ publican nominee came from West Oak
land with a handsome majority.
Now that the election is over it is just
possible that the enthusiastic victors may
â  be tempted to show the fallacy of some of
â¢ the Populist "principles" by" a resort to
1 caricature. This, however, i? quite ex
cusable. During the whole of the cam
paign the Alameda managers would per
mit nothing of the kind, but now that
those so-called "i>rincipies" have been re
* pndiated by the Nation a little exuberant
spirit in this direction may be tolerated.
The committee of citizens is busily at
'=work raising a fund for fireworks, and
they are meeting with great success. The
parade of last Monday was one of hope;
Saturday's pageant will be one of succe -s.
Â° So thoroughly was the Republican party
organised in this county, and so system
atically did each division go about its
"work, that the facts of how the great
battle was won are only just coming to
light. The Sound-money League certainly
did its part. Their crowning feature was
Â° put into practice last Sunday. They had ,
Archbishop Ireland's speech translated '
into .Portuguese, neatly printed in
pamphlet form and illustrated with his
(Â©race's picture. Last Sunday morning,
at the door of every Portuguese church in
this county, a messenger was posted with
enough of these pamphlets to supply the
whole congregation, and as ihey camu out
of their churches one was given to each
â¢ worshiper.
This action of the league no doubt ac
counts in a great measure for the Repub
lican majority sent down from the inte
rior precincts of the county, which have
hitherto been favorable to Democracy.
Last Monday night was the most enthn
siastic night Oakland ever saw, but it will
be entirely eclipsed before midnight of
Saturday.
The Republican banner of the State will
be the mosl prominent feature in the pa
rade. It will be placed on a float drawn
by four milt-white horses immediately
alter Grand Marshal Gas-kill.
JE. K. Taylor this afternoon received the
.following telegram from fl. Z. Osborne of
Los Angeles:
Los Angelis, Nov. 5,
E.K. Taylor Esq.: Receive our hearty con
gratulations on your magnificent majority in
Alameda. We will take back the ban ir.er where
it belongs. H. Z. Osboene.
The line of march decided upon is as
follows: Form on San Pablo avenue, right
on Fifteenth street, to Fourteenth, to
Washington, to E ghtb, to Broadway, to
1 ourteenth, to Harrison, to the Taber
nacle.
Mr. Schoonmaker, General Barnes and
others will make speeches, Â» limit of ten
xmjnutes being agreed upon except by de-
Jaii'l of the audience.
â¢The same aids that were in command of
lal^ Monday* Darade are requested to
genre attain and report to the grand mar
shal at 7:30 in the Connty Committee
rooms, 906 Broadway, to receive mstruc
tionft and regalia.
The following citizens' committee has
been appointed to Bolicit funds: J. A.
Britton, W. G. Henshaw, Edsnn Adams,
P. E. Bowles, J. P. Taylor, Eli Denison,
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 5. â The majority given McKinley by Alameda again entitles that county to the banner which
went south two years ago. The banner is the creation of the Hon. Eli S. Dennison, and cost $165, all of which that gentleman
paid with the exception of $20. which was contributed equally by W. E. Dargie and William Hale. It was completed in the
'. campaign of 1888 and captured by Los Angeles County that fall. Mr. Dennison took it down hinjeelf, and was treated to a ban
! quet. In 1890 it was returned to Aiameda Connty, and the southern gentlemen were tendered a banquet on their arrival here.
On the election of Governor Budd Alameda surrendered the silken token to its southern friends again.
All to-day the wires have been kept busy in order to make the necessary arrangements to get it home for Saturday night's
jollification. To-night the following telegram was received, dated Los Angeles:
Hon. Eli Denison, Oakland; Delegation with banner will leave here to-morrow evening, arriving Oakland Saturday 4. afternoon. Would
have preferred more time to prepare. Answer if satisfactory. B. ff. Lee, Chairman Republican County Central Committee.
At 8 o'clock Mr. Dennison Mired the following answer:
B. W. Lee, Los Angeles: Arrangements satisfactory. Will meet committee at Sixteenth street Saturday afternoon. Eli Denntson.
The banner will be carried in the parade Saturday night, after which the Lo? AnseUs gentlemen will be tendered a banquet
by the Alliance. The guests will include F. X. Schoonmaker of New Jersey, Judge Carpenter of San Francisco and Eli Dennison.
If "Ton" Reed remains in the State until then an effort will be made to have him present.

was condemned at the time the railroad
was put through, was again thrust into
notoriety to-day.
About a week ago she was arrested and
charged with disturbing the peace, be
cause of interference while one of her
houses was oeioc moved into the street,
which was being done so the lot upon
wh eh the house was located could be
graded.
The house was ordered back to its place
by the H i:perintendent, and to->'ay while
it was being xnov d again by Contractor
Grant -Mrs. lownsend cut the hawser
with ii hand ax.
A lively scene followed, which re*ul ted
in the summoning of the Town Marshal
and an ultimate consultation with the
Town Attorney. Mrs. Townsenu's ap
parent idea in cutting the rope was to stop
the further removal of the house, because
it ha i reached the part of the street which
she claims from the Southern Pacific Com
pany. More trouble is anticipated.

ENDED HIS LIFE
IN A GUNSTORE
Deliberate Suicide of a
School â¢ Boy for No
Known Reason.
Grant B. Titus Purchases a
Pistol and Kills Himself
in the Store.
PREPARED FOR AN ACCIDENT
Recently Came From Denver and
Had Resided for a Few Days
With Friends.
Oakland Office SaÂ» Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 5. j
A schoolboy walked into a gunstore this
morning. He looked at a few weapons
and finally purchased a pistol for a dollar.
"This works all right, don't it?" said
the boy.
â¢'Yes, sir," said the dealer.
"Will you give me a load, as I don't
want a whole box of cartridges."
"Certainly," said the gunsmith, as he
proceeded to gratify the requ st.
"Are you sure those cartridges are
good?"
"Yes," answered the man. But before
the word was out cf his mouth, the boy
had proved the truth of his answer. As
soon as the word was spoken he raised the
pistol to bis forehead, fired, and fell life
less to tht floor. Â»
The boy was Grant*B. Titus of Denver,
Colo. On Saturday last he pawned his
nickel watch at the Pioneer Loan Office on
Broadway, and it was at the same place
to-day that he spent the money received
for his watch for a revolver. A little note
found in his poefcet showed that the act
| was premeditated. It was written in
! pencil on the back of an envelope and
I read, "In case of accident, send me to J.
M. O'Neill, third or fourth house the
other side of Knox Park. G. B. Titus."
The envelope was directed to Grant B.
Titus, 2532 Jay street, Denver.
The boy's purse contained a slip of
paper bearing an address where Mrs.
O'Neill formerly lived. In one of his
pockets, carefully folded in a card, was a
little lock of hair and these constituted
his sole possessions.
Mrs. O'Neill is an elderly lady and when
told of the tragedy expr ssed great sur-
I prise. "We never knew him very well,"
{ she said, "but I am well acquainted with
, his mother, who is a widow living in Den
i ver and a very estimable lady. Grant is
not yet 16 years of age and attended the
Manual Training School. He came to our
house Saturday and said he was on his
way to Los Angeles, where he has a friend.
He stayed to dinner and tasse i the even
ing with us. About 10 o'clock he said it
was too late for him to get into the room
he had rented downtown, so we offered
him a bed. He came back every day and
occupied the room at night, but nearly
every morning he bade us good-by, saying
{that he should start for Los Angeles in
j the evening. He acted very strangely
while with us and evaded all questions
put to him regarding hU parents, and I
thought there was something wrontr. He
left here last night about 10 o'clock and
we have not seen him since."
The Coroner has telegraphed the facts
ti Denver, but has heard nothing that
can account for the boy's str;uige action.
Kear Knd Collision.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Nov. 5.â A gravel
train, from Niles goinp toward the pier
ran int > the rear or a freight-train from
Alameda this afternoon. Engineer Lams
den and nis nrcman of the gravel train

Ran Down a Wagon.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. sâ An electric
car on the Fruitvale division of the H. P.
and F. Rai road ran into a team of horses
attached to a coal-wagon, killing a horse
and seriously injuring Ed Hatfield, the
moiorroan. The car was westoound, and
on approaching School street Hatfield
saw the wagon and rang for the track.
Thinking that the teamster would drive
off he did not slow down.
Soon he realized his danger and applied
the brake and dropped to the floor to save
himself. The crash came and he was
pinned to i he floor of the cur and one of
the horses lay dead. It belonged to Will
iam White of East Fourteenth street.
Hatfield was taken out and he walked to a
doctor's residence and then suddenly
grew worse. He is hurt internally. The
accident happened at 7:30 o'clock and de
layed traffic for several i ours.

GAVE HER BABY POISON.
Mrs. C L. Bom's Mistake Nearly
Took Her Child's
Life.
Thousands of Dollars to Be Spent
on the Alameda Race
track.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 6.â By mistake
Mrs. G. L. Born gave her infant child a
dese of corrosive acid this morning, which
came near causing Its death. Mr. Born
had been using the drug, and last night
he placed the bottle alongside the bottle
of medicine for the baby, which was being
treated for a severe cold. Both were in
bottles of the same size and their outward
apDearances were similar.
This morning Mrs. Born took up the
wrong bottle and gave the baby a tea
spoonful of the acid. Its screams of pain
as the acid burned its little mouth made
her realize at once that she had made a
mistake. She ran out and caught Qr.
Lubbock as be was passing the house.
Within lour minutes after the dose had
been swallowed the doctor was at work
and was enabled to save the baby's life.
Money for Improvements.
ALAMEDA, Cai*. Nov. s.â The Driving
Association met last evening and dis
cussed the advisability of improving its
track. The general sentiment was that
the track should be raised a foot, the land
sliuuld be leased for a term of years and
improvements in the shape of buildings
should be erected.
Sanford Bennett announced that the
railroad company would invest $15,000 on
the track, a grand stand, stables, fences,
etc., if a lease of the land was taken and
evidence given that it would be kept in
use. The whole matter was placed in the
hands of the executive committee with
power to act. It had been the association's
intention to hold a race last Saturday, but
the recent rains had left the track so soft
that it could not be used. If possible a
three-minute class race will be run on
Saturday, but the track is still soft.
Will Go to Oakland.
ALAMEDA, OaiÂ», Nov. 6.â The Ala
meda Republican Club and Drill Corps
will turn oat Saiuruay night and go to
Oakland to help celebrate the great vic
tory achieved Tuesday at the polls. They
will spend the intervening days endeavor
ing to secure every instrument known to
produce noice. and the greatest amount of
it. On Monday nicht the club will ratify
at home with a parade on Park street and
speechmaking at the home of Judge Way
mire.

NOT QUITE SO
EASY PICKING
Three Favorites Tumbled
Over at Ingleside Yes
terday.
Howard S Beat the Odds-On
Choice Candelaria Out a
Nose, Driving.
EAVEY'3 STARTING WAS GOOD.
Well Ridden by Bob Isom, Hazard
Disposed of a Good FieldâPres
ton Scored for Pat Dunne.
The favorites have been tramping in
with unaccustomed regularity for the past
few day;Â» at Ingleside and it was with a
feeling of encui that the pencilers gazed
upon the long lines back of their stands
day after day. Time alters all things and
yesterday the members of the booking
fraternity held a matinee of their own. In
the opening race Candelaria, a 1 to 3
chance, was rocked to sleep by Howard S,
and bar two races that came about as the
"d-.ipe" ordered, the talent got corn beef
without any floral decorations. When
but two first choices win itfl is a pretty
sa c thinjr to predict that the bookmakers
quit none loser on the day.
The BUrlace ol the track resembled a
piece of imported velvet and the time
made In the different event* was fast.
The attendance was good and the betting
brisk. Havev sent the fields away in per
lect alignment, paining much praise for
his splendid work, which has been of the
superb order since the beginning of the
m^et.
Howard S, the brown son of imp. Whi,st
lejacket, startled the rail biras by breezing
through tue stretch in 23>^ seconds during
the n\ rains hours, and in the opening
six and a halt furlongs run for two-year
olds took up his 110 pounds, and, bitching
up with the 1 lo 3 chance (Candelaria)
down the stretch, fought it out to the wire
and gained the decision by a nose in 1:23,
a most creditable performance. The win
ner, ridden by Pedro Enos, was 8 to 1 at
post time.
All ongh the horses trained by "Dag
gie" Smith have in the past shown a ten
dency to display more speed at olds than
wh' n at even* or odds on La Mascota ex
perienced not the least difficulty whatever
in finishing in front of Doubtful, Circe, Sir
Richar 1 and three others in the six-fur
long dash that followed. She was handled
by H. Martin and received substantia l sup
port at even money. Circe died away, as
usual, after leading to ihe stretch.
Showing good iorm on Saturday last in
his race wuh Mamie Scott, Dan Miller's
gelding Artemus was rightiuiiy backed
down to 7 to 5 favoritism against the or
dinary lot that faced the barrier in the
third eve* t, also over six furlongs. He
headed February after half the distance
Lad been covered, and won, easing up,
from Aiazan, the t ird choice.
The mile race, that came next, saw
some lively switching in the betting. Lit
tle Cripple, with 107 pounds up, opened
favorite at 9 to 5, but when a stiff play
that brought the odds against Hazard
down from 6 to 2% to 1 developed. Cripple
receded in the books to 2%- Later a
plnnge on Pat Dunne's Benameia cut his
price irom twos to 6to 5 favoritism, and
Hazard went back to sixes again. The
race was by ;ar the best of the day.
Reddington wen toff in an easy, graceful
wny, and simply galloped in front to
within a furlong irom the wire, when the
field closed on him. At this point Hazard,
who was second, shook the others oft un
der punishment, and in a drive beat Little
Cripple out over a length, wi'h Redding
t&n a good third. Benamela's chances
looked bright below the paddock, but he
tired badly, finishing fifth. The winner
was riddeu to the best advantage by Bob
I?om.
The green jacket of Pat Dunne was car
ried K> the front for the first time at the
meeting by the fast sprinter Preston in
the concluding six-furlong spin. Reced
ing from evens to 9 to 5 he headed Miss
Br.-.niinel in the stretch, and in a mild
drive passed the tare a head before the
imported filly. Chartreuse II backed to
an Bto 5 choice finished third. She was
ridden by Piggott, who is displaying very
poor form at present.

cum a bribe to pull the mare Mamie Scott,
was yesterday rmed <>ff the course by the
board of st- wards. It also recommended
that the Turf Congress refuse tl^-apphca
tion of Slocuni lor a jockey's license.
Gallant, who shines best in muddy go
ing, did not appear eager to face ihe bar
rier yesterday. He ran a fair race at that.
The win of Artemus was a very popular
one. Owner Dan Miller has not had the
best success of late with is horses, but
now hopes the tide has turned. Dan had
a good bet down on the gelding as he
thought him almost a "moral."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6, IS9G.
THEY MOURNED
FOR LOST HOPES
Alford, Baker, Lawlor and
Cator Bewailing
Their Fate.
Several Leading Democrats Are
Prostrated With
Grief.
'WAS A TIRRIBLE SHOCK
Not a Very G od Time to Present
Camp, ien Expense Bills at the
House of Mourning.
An sir of gloom has overhune the late
headquarters of the Democratic State Cen
tra! Committee and the Sliver Committee
ever since last Tues lay night.
Visitors who co to either of those places
o collect bills tread. softly on tiptoe as if
at a wake and carefully refrain from whis>
lingr. It is not good iorm to whistle in the
house of the dead.
Chairman Alford is blue, George W.
Baker is blue, William P. Lawlor 13 blue,
and PoiÂ»uii=>t Cator, who put up a nice
little job wi;h Stephen M. White and fell
t.rougn, is bluer than ail.
"O my leilow-Dt-mocratsl O my fused
Populis.sl What a terrible shock it was
to Lie disappointed! Did we not bu^le
tiie doom of the Republican party? Did
we not sound the chaise ur>on Wall street
and the shylock of J-iomuard street and
the grasping -ynd.caies and trusts other
tnau the D rnocialic ones? Did we not
call upon tins greai and loyul people to
renounce the Kepuuiican de-vil uud all his
works and j orups, including Mark Hanna?
Did .hey do v?
"Meihinkb echo answers 'nit. ' '
Tiie blow indeed was a terrible one.
They had been sure of winning. They
I. ud the Republicans on the run. They
would turn the State over for Bryan by
30,000 majority witn the greatest ease.
Wasn't everybody for Bryan except John
P. lush a d E. B. Pondâ andâ and a lew
thou-and n ore leading D mocruts?
Oh, ii n. crue. to be deceived thus, and
worse u.a.i ail to be left in deb; with no
resources o draw from. And now thry
walk the floor in the still watches of the
nii-'ht, Alford and Lawlor and Baker and
Cator, the big four of the big fuse that
sputtered and sputiered and went out in
the sewer.
T^hey are so very disconsolate that they
have not the heart to pack up their politi
cal hopes tor the journey to San River,
but are as men dazed anil are oi\ the way
to Bitter ( reek without their overcoats.
For two hour* yesterday A:tord and he
three sat in headquarter- with their cbi: s
burrowing in their shirt b< soms and their
eyes nxid on t c floor. The big tears th v
Cator shed splashed monotonously like
the drip of the winter raiu in a pine for. St.
.Never a word spoke th -y. 'Twas a time
foV silence and for tears. They were in
terrupted every rive minutes by the en
trance of melancholy looking men wnh
bills in their hands for campaign expenses,
but when Mr. Altord -aw them he waved
them away dejectedly with nis hand and
tne injunction 111 broken-hearted accents:
"Go 'way! Lemma alone; don't you
see we're sics ?''
"Oh ! where's my Senatorship?" groaned
Cator.
"Oh, where is that United States Dis
trict Attorneysnip?" siehed Baker.
â¢'Where's that Superintendency of the
Mint'" murmured Lawlor, his once rosy
cherks now of an a^hen hue.
"Wbere^s everything?" asked Aiforrt,
drearily. "'Where's tne Populists?
Where's the Democrats? Oh, 'tis terrible
to be alone."
Warren B. English came over from Ala
meda wearing a heavy overcoat and with
a band of crape on his hat. He looked
like a man who had suffered ar;d hud not
been thanked for it. His eye* fi.led and
his voice cbofcea up as he" presspd the
hands of his associates in misfortune.
Wlien he took hold of Cator's soit, fat
hand and saw the expression of woe upon
his countenance, he himself, unab c to
bear the strain, was overcome, and fell in
a limp heap into the wast^basket.
Jim Budd was sick abed. Tarpey had
locked himself up in the Palace Hotel an !
was engaged in meditation and Tom
Clunie wao upon the city front in Sacra
mento bewailing the loss of his bets.
It is expected that the patients will be
able to be up next week, when they will
engage in ordinary business pursuits and
give politics a re*t.

WILL PAINT THE
STATE SCARLET
McKinley's Election Will
Be Ratified Next
Saturday.
Republicans All Through Cali
fornia Will Blew the
Horn of Joy.
GOOD DEMOCRATS WELCOMED.
Market Street Will Blaie With Pa
triotic Fire and Ring With
Loyal Music
Republicans will celebrate their glorious
victory over crankism, anarchism and
demagogy by a torchlight procession, a
parade and a jollification meetine ui.der
the auspices of the McKinley Invincibles
next Saturday night.
The parade will be made up of the uni
formed clubs which have done so much
during the campaign to enliven meetings
and turnouts. Loyal citizens not in uni
form are invited to take part and whoop
up things in patriotic style. The parade
will form on New Montgomery street, in
front of the headquarters of the Republi
can State Central Committee, and will
march up Market street for about half or
three-quarters of a mile, with torches,
Roman candles and other fireworks to
assist in imparting a ruddy glare to the
surroundings. Tin horns will be blown,
also, to lacerate the feelings of tbe de
feated.
At the Auditorium there will De sinking
by Sam Booth and the quartet, music by
the band, and short, very short, speeches.
On tbe same evening, by request of the
Republican State Central Committee,
there will be parades and meetings in
every city in the State. The Republican
party is a big one, and it will not be satis
fied with painting the town red; it will
paint the whole State scarlet with joy.
The National Republican League held a
meeting la 3 t night at 24 Fourth street for
the purpose of arraneinz for the blowout
in this City. Z. U. Dodge presided, and
C. B. Tidbail occupied the secretary's
chair.
Shortly before the meeting was called
to order Colonel George Stone, grand mar
shal of the magnificent parade of last
Saturday, came in and was warmly con
gratulated by the league on the admirable
manner in which he had arranged and
carried out the details of the affair. He
said he had not bad half a night's sleep
since Sunday, was tired, and was zlad that
he was ti:ed, inasmuch as the cause of his
fatigue was his sitting up to receive the
election returns announcing the success of
his personal friend, Major McKinley.
The meeting was rather informal, and
nothing was done beyond electing Colonel
Sumner grand marshal, on motion of
Colonel Stone. The details of the jollifica
tion were left with the State Central Com
mittee.
The State Central Committee yesterday
afternoon sent to the chairmen of all tne
county committees a telegram, of which
the following is a copy :
We recommend that a celebration and rati
fication of the glorious victory achieved by
the Republican party be hell throughout the
State on Saturday evening, 7ta inst. We urge
you to take all necessary steps to watch the
canvass before the Supervts >rs. Very truly
yours, Fbank McLacghlin, Chairman.
THE GRAND JURY PATROL
Election Clerk Caught and In
dicted for Ccmm tting
Fraud.
Several "Kitties" Were Demolished.
A Bottle of Whisky Was
Confiscated.
The Grand Jury, divided into blocks of
two, made the rourftis of the voting pre
cincts Tuesday and Wednesday niuhts
and rendered service in the cause of purity
of election. One election clerk, Patrick F.
Roberts, in the Tenth Precinct of the
Thirty-third Assembly District, was
caught in the very act of skipping the
name of James A. Maguire for Congress
The omission was observed by William L.
Ashe and Harry W. Goodali, members of
the Grand Jury, who were looking over
his shoulder. The first time that Ma
euire's name was skipped the suspicion of
the watchers was arousec", but nothing
was said until the offense was repeated.
When tbe grand jurors became convinced
tbat the clerk was deliberately commit
ting fraud, they had him arrested on the
spot.
A special meeting of the Grand Jury
was convened Wednesday afternoon, and
on the testimony presented Roberts was
indicted for felony.
At one of the precincts south of Market
â¢treet a member of the Grand Jury ob
served a cigar box was being u^ed as a
'kitty." He called the attention of tbe
judges and inspectors of election to the
open viol" tion of the law and said, "The
box must be removed."
One of the officers replied with indiz na
tion, H 'lt will not be removed " The grand
juror aid not waste words, but instantly
tore the box from its fastenings and
smashed it with bis foot. Tne protesting
election officer sprane toward the juror
with a pretense of fiehting, but his asso
ciates caught him. The demolished
"kitty" contained the sum oi 80 cents,
which was turned over to the policeman
at tbe booth. In three other precincts
"kittieÃ" were removed.
In one of the hilj booths of the Forty
third Assembly District Henry Durbrow
and Edward B. Cutler, members of tbe
Grand Jury, found a bottle ol wnisky with
tbe cork started. It was carefully
wrapped in paper and placed in the cor
ner. Attention was called to the violation
of the law and the name of the owner
called for. None of tbe election oflicera
would acknowledge ownership and the
whisky was seized. Mr. Cutler knows the
owner and will return the confiscated
liquor to-day.
In many places the election officers were
on the looko-jt for the Grand Jury. The
knowledge that a night patrol of the pre
cinct voting places were in contemplation
kept many of the clerks on tb'ir good be
havior. The members of the Grand Jury
were lavorably impressed with the intrlli
gence and good conduct of the election of
ficers and clerks. The material was of a
higher grade than they expected to find.
Several members of the Grand Jury
believe that a change should be made in
the election law requiring the ballots to be
taken out of the box every heur and
counted. Tbe new system might cause
some additional expense, but it is con
tended that much of the delay, confusion
and carelessness incident to handling and
counting the ballots at night would be
obviated. The crooked work is mainiv
done in the early hours of tbe morning be
tween 2 and 6 o'clock, when the clerks are
weary and the watchers off their guard. â¢
THE HON. FRANK McLAUGHLIN, the Chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, whose skill and ability contributed so much
toward the great victory in California.
The splendid victory just now for McKinley and Hobar{ in California is due in a large measure
to the superb skill and marvelous exertions of the Hon. Frank McLaughlin, chairman of the Republi
can State Central Committee.
The disheartening features â of the campaign four months ago had no parallel in the political
history of California. Republicans were disorganized and despondent. Democrats and Populists
combined were elated and exultant. Their managers pointed to a Populist vote, united to the
Democratic strength, which gave a majority of 53,000, which the Republicans had to overcome in
order to achieve victory. In San Francisco alone the Republicans were confronted by Budd's
majority of 11,000 added to the Populist vote of 7000, a majority of 18,000 to combat. Added to
these discouragements the Republicans of San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland were demoralized
by factional fights which seemed bitter beyond hope of reconciliation.
Confronted by such obstacles and in the face of such odds Major Frank McLaughlin began
the work of organization. At the outset the committee found that registration in the State was
remarkably light. Republicans yielding to the silver defection and not willing to turn against their
own party had resolved to remain passive and unregistered. When the State Committee organized
for active work, and sought as .the first step toward success to secure the registration of every
Republican voter, County Committees sought delay, fearing that Republican activity would cause
immense registration of Populists and Democrats. In order not to alarm the formidable enemy
efforts to secure a complete enrollment of Republican voters were conducted for a long time with the
utmost secrecy, but with surprising activity,
Four months ago the campaign of education began, and for sixteen hours a day Major
Frank McLaughlin, M. R. Higgins and Jacob Steppacher devoted themselves to the hard work
ahead of them. Members of the State Committee generally gave their earnest support, and, as
Major McLaughlin observed last night, John D. Spreckels and Paris Kilburn were always ready to
respond instantly with their counsel and assistance. Never before was California so thoroughly
canvassed. The voters of every precinct were addressed. The State Committee sent to the
field sixty speakers, and each one spoke to many audiences. One speaker, Major Kyle, ad
dressed 120 meetings. More than a million documents went out from the bureau of literature
to the voters of the State.
The odds were so great against the Republicans in the early stages of the campaign that,
had the election taken place immediately after the nominations at Chicago, Bryan would have
carried California by 7 5, c00 majority. Undismayed by the superior numerical strength of the
opposition, Major McLaughlin lined up the Republicans in every county. The despondent were
animated and the wavering were rallied.
At no time in the progress of the contest did the National Republican Committee expect
to win in California. Victory was hoped for, but not anticipated. Obstacles did not depress
Major McLaughlin, but simply signified to him the necessity for higher exertion and greater
activity. As he expressed it last evening: "When our resources were exhausted and the con
test against overpowering odds seemed hopeless, John D. Spreckels came to our rescue. Paris
Kilburn, too, was ready at all times to counsel and assist Mr. Higgins and myself."
Apart from the success in the field of leadership which Hon. Frank McLaughlin has so
signally achieved, he has demonstrated beyond all question that he possesses the qualities of
courage and patience which stamp the highest order of broad-gauged men. His unfailing good
nature, his constant vigilance, his personal magnetism and persuasive style of happily adjusting
differences were required at all times, and, however great or instant was the emergency, he
was never lacking in mental or physical resource to meet the demand. The Republicans, Sound
Money Democrats and a!l the rest of the good and loyal people of the State owe him a debt of
gratitude.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1896.
THE DAWN OF
PROSPERITY HERE
Mills Are Opening as a
Result of Republican
Victory.
New Enterprises Springing Into
Existence in All Branches
of Trade.
WOBK FOR IDLE MEN CERTAIN.
Valley Road Preparing to Issue Bon s
and Build Southwardâ Southern
Pacific Activity.
Another day has added still further
proof that the great National victory â the
election of McKinley and the survival of
protection to American industries â has
been the harbinger of good times. Even
more than that, the victory has already
brought prosperity. The moment it was
heralded throughout the country there
came an industrial awakening, new enter
prises that bad been suppressed sprang
into life, and hoarded wealth flowed from
safe deposit vaults for investment in
various directions.
The most significant feature of the re
vival, perhaps, is the talk of mills open
ing in tne near future, industries about to
be started and new chances for employ
ment of mechanics, clerks and laboring
men.
The Valley road directors are already
preparing bonds with a view of promptly
resuming construction south of Fresno
and in other directions. This work will
employ several hundred workmen. Tne
Southern Pacific Company's managers
anticipate a boom in freight business, and
looks to giving increased employment in
the carshops and along the road in conse
quence of this improvement. From all
directions are heard rumors of such an
encouraging nature as the following state
ments of well-known men will show:
E. F. Preston, attorney for tne San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
way, is happy over the Republican vic
tory. He declared yesterday that it
meant prosperity to the Nation. Said he:
''We think. that the result of the elec
tion has removed all obstacles in the wav
of issuing bonds. There are no obstacles
now, and that is the fact.
"This means that just as soon as we can
get to work bonds lor the Valley road will
be iasued and building resumed. We
have given an order for ihe engraving of
the bond. As soon as the bonds are en
graved and printed we will place them on
the money market. It will then be only a
little while when we start work. This in
volves the expenditure of several million
dollars, half of which, at least, will go to
labor. We were waiting for the election
of MeKinlev before thinking of issuing
those bonds.' :
Deputy Fish Commissioner J. P. Bab
cock is well pleased with the way the
election went so far as National politics
are concerned. He is convinced tbat this
is the beginning of a period of prosperity
and good times. He said: "I have nu
doubt but tbat the Republican party will
carry out the strong protective policy that
has always been associated with its name.
With sound money, the restoration of pub
lic confidence and protection to manu
facturers and laborers, I see no reason
why we should not enjoy at least four
years of good times."
S. H. Tacy, manager of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, also
looks forward to the good times in the
very near future. "Long before the elec
tion I predicted an era of prosperity if
McKinley should be elected and the Re
publican party be restored to the first
place again." he said. "I have no doubt
new industries will soring up at once.
Capital has long been looking to the West
for investment, but nothing would or
could be done so long as the money ques
tion remained unsettled. Moreover, the
moneyed men of this country had no idea
of investing their money so long as t ere
waÂ« a chauce that the country stood in
danger of being upset by the unlimited
coinage of silver."
Julian Sonntagof the California Miners'
Association and president of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association also
looks forward to better times now that
Major McKinley is elected. He has been
a stanch advocate of the sound-money
candidate.
C. 8. Crittenden said: "From the ex
pressions of the many business and pro
fessional men who stable their horses
with me I have every reason to believe
that there will be a sudden and beneficial
boom all over the country."
Dr. Henry G.bbons Jr. said: "We must
expect a revival of good times now there
is no longer any suspense over the policy
of the Government of the United States.
The people have sealed the policy of the
Nation for the next four years, and with
President McKinlry at the head of the
Nation a general confidence will enter into
all branches of industry."
C. L. Field, secretary of the Norton Tan
ning Company, said: "The election of Mc-
Kinley will bring about a general healthy
tone in every branch of business. We are
beginning to ft ci the effects already."
Augu-uis E. Dicker, a member of the
present Grand Jury, said: "It can be
noticed already in every line of trade.
Our business seems to have taken a healthy
and firm hold. -The people are no longer
dreading some expected calamity from the
uncertain Democratic movements lately
induiged in by that party. The country is
rich and full of resources. All ihe people
wanted was confidence in the Government.
Now they are assured."
George W. Reed, merchant. 106 Clay
street, said: "Every man with whom 1
have cotnp in contact since last Tuesday
seems to fee tbat the darkness of depres
sion has passed over the business portion
of the country and good tunes are going
to come, and come soon, too."
John Gibson, secretary of the Judson
Manufacturing Company, said: "We have
noticed the good effects already. Tliai is
there seems to be a tone of confidence in
the business world that means pmspesity.
If Brvan had been elected I k v not
what would have become of the in^ustr es
of this country. But, thank God and the
people, he is not."
F. L. Turpin, a director of thÂ» Colum
bian Banking Company, saia : "It cannot
be but beneficial, because the country pos
sesses great wealth, ihtre is an abundance
of money and muscle at the disposal of
those who wi-h to use them, and now
since all uncertainty has passed our good
times will commence."
' W. J. Herrin said: "I have not met a
man â Democrat or Republican â but who
fee s that we will have better times. That
spirit of unrest and uncertainty has
passed. The election of McKinley, whose
policy was'so well known, sets at rest any
and all misgivings as to what will follow
after he takes his seat."
M. F. Sniitn, the "Borax Kinp," stated
yesterday that he will be^in operations at
once in his borax fields in Southern Cali
fornia. He had been waiting the result of
th- elections, and now that McKinley is
the President-elect Mr. Smith's enterprise
will be developed with renewed energy.
"I will put on about 200 men immediately
in my borax works," he said, "and all be
cause McKinley has been chosen for our
next Pres dent."

estate agents, said: "We are handling the
Weber estate property in Stockton, where
the land is adjacent to the Sau Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley Railway. A
number of factories, enterprises to be lo
cated on this property, were in contempla
tion for some time past, but were held in
abeyance pending the result of the elec
tion. We have received word that the
various deals are going to be pushed
ahead now as the result ol the Republi
can victory. A bicycle factory, a cracker
factory, a gun factory on the Weber tract
are now assured, and there are others
that have not mentioned their special
lines of business.
"A large number of sales held off pend
ing the election, and we calculate to put
them through. Some of them are good,
representative sales."
W. G. Curtis, engineer of the mainten
ance of way department of the Southern
Pacific Railway, said: "The company
has not settled on anything so far in the
way of extending it's *vork. We expect
good times to come now, and with them
we shall take up new work on the line.
Confidence has returned."
General Manager Kruttschnitt of the
Southern Pacific Company said : "We are
hopetul of a large increase in general busi
ness, and lor that reason we expect to do
more on our line. As business springs up
throug out the country tliere will be
more demand lor cars, in which case more
cars will have to go into the repair t-hops,
wh eh means employment for more men.
The increase in raiiroad business depends
on the future increase of traffic. We feel
the return of confidence as individuals
feel it. All over the country orders were
delayed awaiting the elections, and now
as these orders will be given immediately
we ought to feel the effect within a week.
Everybody feels as if a preat load hang
ing by a thread over their heads had been
removed."
General Traffic Manager Smurr said:
"1 io< k fora large increase in shipments
of California drie>i fruits, canned .runs,
etc., in the immediate lutiire, on the
theory that the trade had not been buying
prior to the elections owing to ihe uncer
tainty then prevailing. Now that stabili.y
iÂ« secured and the people have confidence
Eastern merchants will put in .arge stocks
to replenish their stores, an<l this will cive
an impetus to the fruit indubtry in Cali
fornia."
One of the men most hiehly elated over
the election ol Major M< Ktnley is James
R. Kelly, president o tu<- Hibernia Bank.
"Talk about a revival of business," said
Mr. Kelly, "why, it has beuun already.
Even yesterday and to-day have witnessed
a stream of depositors flowing through our
doors such as we have not had for some
time.
"The indications are such that I believe
wt shall enjoy almost unexampled pros
perity for tue next three or four years, ana
perhaps for ten.
"During the depression, owing to finan
cial disturbances since Bryan's nomina
tion, many mortgages have fallen due,
and the majority ol the banks have failed
to renew theTu. We, however, have always
renewed mortgage*. Now we are giad â >! it.
"Even if Brvan had been elected Ido
not believe that the Supreme Court would
have permitted this c -untry to repudiate
its debts. That Bryan's election would
have produced general < onsternation there
can be no doubt, and I bel;eve there would
nave been a heavy run on the banks for at
least two or three months."
"Yes," said Ri bert J. Tobin, Police
Commissioner and secretary of the Hiber
nia Bans, "we have had a great many
more deposits since McKinley's election.
It seems to have inspired confidence.
"If Bryan had been elected prosperity
would have been postponed for several
years. There has been a run on the banks
ever since bis nomination. There is no
use In denyine that. Everybody knows it.
"This feeling of impending disaster
would probably have become more inten
sified if Bryan had been elected, espe
cially among the more timid classes."
C. 8. Capp, the real estate agent at 415>Â£
Montgomery street, is quite enthusiastic
over the election returns. "I believe that
the results as shown will benefit this City,
State and country in no small degree," ha
said. "Money has been tied up in our
savings banks for a very long time, and in
the past two days, since McKinley's elec
tion, it is an assured fact it has been
loosening up. 1 hear of inquiries now for
investment, a thing comparatively un
known before election day. I truly be
lieve there is an era of prosperity now
