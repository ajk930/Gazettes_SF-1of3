REJOICIM* AT HAT AX A.
I'retnature Mirth of Spaniards Owr,
Mnern'm Alleged Death.
MADRID, Sfaiit, Dec. B.â The Havana
correspondent of the Imparciui has sent a
dispatch to that paper which has caused
rejoicing among the people of this city,
who take it for grauted that the state
ments made are true. The corre
spondent claims that he has per
sonally made an investieation of
reports current in Havana to the effect
that Antonio Maceo, second in command
of the rebel army, and the son of Maximo
Gomez, the rebel commander-in-chiof,
are dead and found the rumors to be true. !
In official circles the report is accepted with j
reserve.
The correspondent briefly gives the de
tails of the defeat by a Spanish force of
2COO rebels near Punta Brava, about
twelve miles west of Havana. The insur
gents' loss is placed at forty killed.
It has already been officially announced j
about six times that Antonio Maceo had j
beÂ«"n killed, and there had been rumor? '
innumerable to ti:e same effect. Hereto
fore it has been the custom of the Spanish
officials to announce the death of Maceo
whenever he defeated the Spaniards.either
in strategy or open battle. No recent re
ports have been received of the death of
the Cuban leader, and it is conjectured
that American correspondents in Havana,
knowing the ways of the Spanish officials,
have placed so little credence in the report
that they have not mentioned it in their
dispatches. It is reported that Maceo has
crossed the trocha and is proceeding west
ward to join the army of Gomez, and this
may have caused the Spanish officials to
circulate the report that he was dead.
There was found among the dead rebels
tfee body of a well-dressed man, on which
lberÂ« were documents which led to the be
lief that the dead man was the son
of Maximo Gomez. Among the papers
lound was one on which, written with a
lead-pencil, was the confession that the
writer had committed suicide rather than
abandon the body of Antonio Maceo.
The war diary of Maceo was nlso found.
In it there is an entry which says the
rebels crossed the trocba on December 4.
It is conceded from these circumstances
that Ma ceo was killed in the engagement
with Major Cirujeda's command. The
news of Ins death has caused the greatest
kind of a sensation in Havana. Tne loyal
ists are jubilant, believing that with the
killing ut Maceo a blow has been stiuk at
the rebellion that, will result in its speedy j
suppression. The rebel sympathizers, j
though they feel very desponde:it over the j
loss of the rebel leader, a considerable'
number of them place little reliance on the
truth of the news.
The Government officials vouchsafe no
, information as to how Maceo, with an
V-verwhelmingly superior force operating
1 ainst him, ana supposed to be watching
â¢ - movements, couid have eluded the
Spaniard*, doubled on them, trossed the
trocha at what has been supposed tho
strongest part of it, and reached the prov
ince of Havana without interference until
he was close to Havana.
Though the Spaniards are confident that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
Maceo Is really dead this time some of the
Cubans profess to believe that the finding
of the confession and the diary was due
to a trick of the insurgents to delude the
Spanish into the belief that Maceo was
killed while he pursues his plan of reach
ing Gomez. The important news reached
j Havana last night, but the censor would
not permit of its being cabled until this
evening.
Major Cirujeda is now in the city, and it
has been proposed to hold a great demon
i st ration in his honor. In the cafes and all
other public places the Spanish residents
are congratulating eacu other on what
they believe to be a death blow to the re
bellion, and it is predicted that Captain-
I General Weyler will now have an easy
task in defeating the insurgents under
j Gomez and the minor leaders. For nearly
I two years there has not been such joy in
I Havana as there is now and the speedy
| establishment of peace is confidently
j looked for. It is thought that when Go
mez learns of the death of his chief lieu
tenant he will be disposed to treat with
Weyler for a cessation of hostilities.
There is some ground, nevertheless, for
the supposition that the report is not
true. The officials here declare that while
â  they believe that both Maceo and Gomez's
son are dead they lack positive informa
tion and are awaiting a confirmation of
: the report. This, however, has had no
I effect upon the popular jubilation, and
! Major Cirujeda is the hero of the hour. It
is also reported the rebel leader Valencia
was killed in a recent engagement.
The message of President Cleveland to
Congress, wherein he treats of the Cuban
question, has created a bad impression in
political circles and depresses the Bourse.
In Government circles greater silence is
maintained, none of the officials display
ing a willingness to discuss the subject at
j any length, thoueh some satisfaction is
i expressed that the messa.e does not iiÂ»
any way advocate the absolute indepen
dence of Cuba and does not support the
proposal to recognize the insurgents as
belligerents.
The opposition pipers are greatly irri
j tated by the threat of intervention on the
! part of the United States, unless Snain
speedily suppresses the rebellion. They
declare that Spain is fully able to avert
such action.
VICTORIES ON PAPER. ONLY.
Spanish Leaders Itrport Baring Routed
the insurgents.
HAVANA, Cttba, Dec. B.â Major Ciru
junda, having received information that a
force of rebels i>ad arrived in the vicinity
of Punta Brava, in the Havana province,
started with his command in the direction
the rebels were believed to b9. The
Spanish troops met the main body of in
surgents, 2000 strong, at San Pedro and
engaged them in battle. The insurgents
intrenched themselves behind stone fences
and held the position until nightfall, when
they were dislodged and compelled to re
tire. The Spaniards then returned to
Punta Brava. They lost in the fight three
privates killed and three lieutenants and
eight privates wounded. Over forty of the
rebels were left dead upon the field.
Reports received here state that General
Figurva's command has had an engage
ment with the rebels at Rio Hondo, near
San Jose de Lajas, Havana province.
The Spaniards came upon the outposts of
the rebels and immediately opened fare
upon them. The tire was briskly re
turned and the euKagement lasted until 6
o'clock p. m. The rebel outposts were
captured and the position occupied by
their main body in Wie Morales Hills was
then attacked. A cavalry charge by the
Spaniards was repulsed, Dut the insur
gent were finally driven from the field,
leaving behind them over sixty of their
number dead. It is believed that they
carried with them many wounded. The
Spaniards lost a lieutenant-colonel and a
private killed and one lieutenant and
twenty privates wouudeJ. During the
battle thirty -five cannon shots were fired
oy the rebels.

newspaper* Abroad Comment on the
'.. â  - Message of the President. -
' BERLIN, Germany, Dec. B.â The Vos
sische Zsitung says in its comments on
President Cleveland's message to Congress
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
THE NEW JOURNALISM
Referring to disreputable journalism Rev. William H. Faunce says : " There are two newspapers in this
city whose very names are synonyms of degradation ; whose very posters reek with moral poison ; which
exist by the systematic and purposed corruption of their readers. They have become purveyors of lust
and brutality, and diurnal instigators of crime. Every father dreads to see them in the hands of his son, and
every pure mother snatches them from her daughter's hand. They parade our streets simply for evil purposes,
fattening on the weakness of human nature and resembling nothing so much as a garbage-cart dragged through the
streets dripping with the unspeakable. Yet they ask admission to our homes. If asked what it is right to print,
we cannot always answer. But we all know the difference between an enterprise fighting for purity and truth and
one seeking to pollute the people." â Leslie's Weekly.
that the document doei not justify either
fears or expectation* in regard to the
Cuban insurrection. The policy of Presi
dent McKinley, the paper adds, will, how
ever, probably be different.
The Cologne Gazette expresses hope that
the proposals ruade by President Cleve
land will be approved by the Spanish
Government before a chance in the United
States administration shall take place, and
adds that it is possible that the United
States and Spain will reach an agreement
which will pacify Cuba. The paper fur
ther says the President's puggestions in
no wav ;end to lessen Spain's honor.
TORONTO, Qn., Dec. B.â The Mail and
Empire, reviewing the President's mes
sage, says: "Throughout the Cuban para
graphs of the message arc free from bun
combe or jingoism, and the interest of the
United States in the struggle is not 100
strongly asserted. Judged by what he
says on the subject of the revenue, Mr.
Cleveland is not likpiy to give his sanction
lo the Dingley bill, if that measuro of
temporary roiief should go through Con
gress. From all appearances the session
is likely to be a barren one."
The Globe says: "Perhap3 the most sug
gestive as well as tne most prominent
feature of Cleveland's message to Congress
is the reference to military strength and
foreign relations. The people of the United
States may question the divine right, but
they faithfully believe in the divine power
of Government?."
EXERCISING ITS FUNCTIONS.
Senor l'nlntn Tell* of the Government
E*tnt>U*hel by Insurgent*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. B.â Senor
Estrada Palma, delegate of the Cuban re
public in the United States, gave out a
statement to-day regarding the reierence
by President Cleveland to Cuba in his
annual message to Congress. He thinks
the message, generally speaking, is in a
great measure very depressive to Spain as
an independent nation and supports the
Cubans in their distrust oi any promise
whatsoever that the Spanish Government
can mako to them and pledges the guar
anty of ti:e united States as a security fo:
an ag; cement which Spain may enter
upon with Cuba.
"As to the inference contained in the
message that the Cuban Government has
now piven up all attempt to exerc se its
functions, I shall," says Senor Palma,
"only mention the fact to prove the con
trary that immediately after the capture
of Guaimtfro by General Calixto Garcia,
President Cisneros and his Cabinet pro
ceeded to the town and there issued and
enforced various decrees, some of which
related to the treatment of prisoners and
to further military operations, thus prov
ing that the Civil Government of the Re
public of Cuba commands the respect and
obedience of the military authorities.
'*it is idle talk," he said, "to speak of
autonomy to the Cuban people. Abso
lute independence of Spain is the aim of
the Cubans."
FELLOR FATLE EPIDEMIC
Frightful Mortality . Anioni the Spanish
â¢' \ ' '_' hold in Cuba. '. . . ,
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. B.â The
monthly public health report, published
by the United States Marine Hospital ser
vice, in its issue of to-day givÂ»s an appall
ing picture of the ravages erf disease and
plague in Cuba. According to the reports
of the officers of the Marine Hospital ser
vice stationed at Havana and Tther ports
on the islands, yeliow fever is reported
epidemic at various places.
The sanitary inspector at Havana re
ports that during the week ending No
vember 26 there were in that city 220 new
cases of yellow fever and eighty-seven
leaths, while the number of deaths from
smallpox was fifty-four. Of the eighty
seven deaths from yeliow fever, eighty
three were among Spanish eoldiera in the
hospitals. All the smallpox deaths oc
curred amons civilians.
The mspectdr at Santiago reports that
yeliow fever prevails amort? the troops,
anil as a new contingent of 20,000 recruits
was shortly to arrive a fresh outbreak of
the fever will be feared. It is also an
nounced that in the eight military hos
pifals in and arot:nd Havana there are no
less than 10.000 sick and wounded Spanish
soldiers. Official reports of the Spanish
army sanitary authorities concede that
during one period of twenty days there
were admitted to the military hospitals
1835 cases of yellow fever, and that during
the same period there were 497 deaths
from the same disease. These official
figures will give nn approximate idea of
thÂ« frightful mortality from yellow fever
among the Spanish soldiers.

Senate.
PHELAN MAY ACT UNDER IT.
Nearly All the Provisions of the

Samuel Braunhart, State Senator elect,
will concentrate his best energies during
the next session of the Legislature to se

for every act of legislation.
The bill will especially cure the defect of
the consolidation act pointed out by the
Supreme Court in Jacobs vs. the Board of
Supervisors in the matter of the ordin
ance fixing water rates, wherein it declares
that that ordinance does not require the
Mayor's approval. Under Mr. Braun
hart's bill such an ordinance will need his
approval.
The bill will be presented early in the
session, and every effort made to rush it
through and to secure the signature of the
Governor, in order that the new Mayor of
this City may act under it.
The act to be presented to the State
Senate is as foliows:
An act to require ordinances and resolutions
Eassed by trie City Council or other legislative
ody of any municipality to be presented to

or layi. g tax or assessment, or establishing
rates for water or artificial light, and every
ordinance or resolution imposing a duty or
penalty which shall have passed the City
Council shall, before it takes effect, be pre
sented to the Mayor for hisapmoval. The Mayor
shall return such ordlnanc or resolution to
the City Council within ten days after receiv
ing it. It he approve it he shall sign it, and
it shall then take effect. If he disapprove it

pr.ival within the time above specified, it shall
lake effect as ifhehÂ«d unproved it. The ob
jections of the Mayor shall be entered at large
on the journal of the City Council, and the
City Council snail cause the same to be imme
diately published. The City Council shall,
t.fter five and within thirty days af;er such or
dinance or resolution shall have been returned
with the Mayor's disapproval reconsider and
vote upon the same, aud if the same shall,
upon reconsideration, be again passed by the
affirmative vote of not less than three- fourth!
of nil the members, the presiding officer shall
certify that lact on the ordinance or resolu
tion, ana when so certified it shall take effect
an if It had received the approval of the Mayor;
but if the oidinance oi resolution shall fail to
receive upon the first vote thereon after its re
turn with the Mayor's disopprovnl the affirma
tive vote of three-fourths of all the members,
it shall be deemed finnliy lost. Tne vote oa
such reconsideration shall be tn.keu by ayes

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. B.â The
Senate spent less than half an hour in ses

them the annual report of the Govern
ment directors of tbe Union Pacific Com
pany.
Petitions from Philadelphia and St.

Patsagc of the. Pention Bill and Poatal
Measures Reported by Loud.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. B.â The
House promptly got down to business to
day, resuming the call of committees
where it left off at the close of last ses
sion. Under the call the Committee on
Postoffices and Postroads occupied
nearly three hours of the session, in that
time securing the passage of three bills.
These were: Authorising the use of
private postal cards.; authorizing the
Postmaster-General to allow an indem
nity not exceeding $10 in any one case for
the loss of registered packages or letters;
authorizing the appointment of Wter-car
riers at offices where the free delivery sys
tem is not estaoiished, the cost thereof to
be borne by the patrons.
The general pension appropriation bill
was then taken up, and Grow (R.) of
Pennsylvania made a brief speech in favor
of a protective tariff based upou the Presi
dent's recommendation in his message on
the present tariff law.
The pension bill was passed without
amendment.
The documents in the contest ol Thomas
E. Watson vs. J. C. C. Black for a seat in
the Fifty-fourth Congress from the Tenth
Georgia District were received from the
Clerk of the House and by the Speaker re
ferred to the Committee on Elections.
The House of Representatives in its sec
ond day's session plunged into routine
business.
Hull (R.) of lowa offered a resolution
referring to the Committee on Military
Affairs so mucu of the report of the
Board of Soldiers' Homes as under the
rules should go to that committee. After
home desultory discussion the Speaker
stated that he would refer the repori to the
Appropriation Committee. This was f-at
i-fHCtory. and the resolution was agreed to.
Loud (R. ) of California, from the Com
mittee on Postofhces and Postroads,
called up the bill authorizing the .use of
private cards to be no longer than the of
ricial cards and to be carried by affixing a
stamp. The bill takes effect July 4, 1897.

It was passed without objection and with
out further argument-
Load also called up the bill authorizing
the Postmaster-General to make regula-
tions by which senders of registered let
ters or packages my be indemnified in a
sum of not exceeding $10 in any one case
for loss of letters or packages in the mail
tn bs paid out of the postal revenues.
Postmasters-General Bissell and Wilson
approved the bill.
Quizg (R.) of New York opposed the
bill, suggesting an increased fee to meet
the cost of insurance to recoup the Gov
ernment.
Bingnam (R.) of Pennsylvania, sup
porting the bill, replied to Hopkins (R.)
of Illinois, stating that the experience of
every country which had adopted the in
demnity for losses had been that the reve
! nues from increased business was vastly
creater than the cost of insurance. The
bill was passed â 76 to 13.
Loud also called up the House bill
directing Postmasters at places where
there Is no free mail delivery, upon the
petition of twenty persons receiving mail
at one office, to appoint carriers, who shall
be paid for their services by the patrons
who utilize them.
Sperry (R.) of Connecticut advocated
the passage of the bill and Bingham op
posed it, because of increased liability to
mail depredation through the employ
ment of such a force.
The passage of the bill was advocated
| by Williams (Dem.) of Missouri, Smith
|(Rep.)of liiinoi=, Johnson (Rep.) of Cali
j fornia and PicKler (Rep.) of South Dakota,
j and opposed by Loud. The latter gentle
! man said that this amounted to nothing,
I conferred no privilece or richt that did
! not now exist. Any man or body of men
I could select a messeneer to call and de
liver their mail and pay him for it if they
I wanted to do so. It was, besides, a dan-
I gerous measure.
The bill whs passedâ lol to 13.
The House then resolved itself into com
mittee of the whole and proceeded to con
sider the general pension appropriation
bill. The provisions of the bill were briefly
explained by W. A. Stone (Rep.) of Penn
sylvania. It carried a total appropriation
of $141,283,880, less by $65,000 than the ap
propriation for the current year and the
estimates of the Commissioner. No new
legislation was proposed in the bill.
Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania, the vener
able Representative and ex-Speaker of the
House, took the occasion liberally ac
corded under the rules to make a tariff
speech. He took his text from the Presi
dent's message relating to the Wilson
tariff bill: "The only entire fiscal year
during which this law has been in force
ended ou the 30th day of June, 1896. In
' that year our imports increased over those
j of the previous year more than $G,500,000,
i while the domestic products we exported
land which found markets abroad was
' neariy $70,000,000 more than during the
j preceding year. Whatever may be its
I shortcomings as a complete measure of
tariff reform, it must be conceded that it
has opened the way to a freer and greater
! exchange of commodities between the
I United Statea and other countries and
; tt-.u- furnished a wider market for our
products and manufactures."
In the two years and five months ended
I December 1, Mr. Grow >aid, the deficiency
in the revenue of the Government
amounted to $110,000,000 and yet the Presi
dent made no recommendation to Con
gress regarding the increase of revenue.
I He did say, However, (hat no deficit that
had occurred or that was likely to occur
need excite or disturb.
"In a most placid, comfortable frame of
mind," aaid Grow, "the President evi
dently thinks the creditors of the Nation
will not be anxious so long as tbe en^rav
ers and printing presses of the country
do not break down."
Grow said he would not consider the
tariff in any partisan sense, Dut as a
simple business matter affecting the reve
nues of the treasury. If the present law
was not good for anything, the first duty
of Congress was to provide revenues for
the Government. He compared the work
ings of tbe McKinley and Wilson laws,
and sarcastically referred to the President's
assertion that tbe latter "had opened the
way to a freer and greater exchange of

ruled out on points of order.
Bingham (R.) of Pennsylvania, recalling
President Cleveland's statement in his
message to Congress four years ago, that
"Thousands of neighborhoods have their
well known pension frauds, and that
recent developments by the investigations
of the bureau had shown appalling con
spiracies to commit fraud," reviewed the
work of the bureau in exposing fraud since
that message was published. To investi
gate these alleged frauds, said Bingham,
more money had been appropriated than
the bureau had asked. The result was
that in the three full fiscal years included
within the present administration there
had been less than 500 convictions for

DISAPPOINTED THE BELLE.
At the Eleventh Hour the Bride-to-Be
Received a Noio From the
Cowardly Groom.
SEA ISLE CITY. N. J., Dec. B.â For
weeks pretty Ruth Hoffman, the acknowl
edged belle of Mameruuska, N. J.. had
been making preparations for her wed
dine. George B. Erninger, a prosperous
farmer's son, was to have wed Miss Hoff
man at 8 o'clock Saturday. At tbat hour
the Hoffman home' was brightly lighted
and crowded with invited relatives and
friends.
The bridegroom did not put in an ap
pearance at 8 o'clock. At 8:30, when it
was concluded that B:Â»rninger had met
with an accident, smie one was about
to seek him when hiÂ« brother arrived,
and, calling the bride aside, handed her a
letter. Misa Hoffman, with nervous lin
gers, hurriedly tore" open the envelope.
Then as she scanned the lines her chesks
grew pale, she gave a little tasp, the mis
sive fell from her fintrers and she threw
out her arms and fell fainting to the
floor.
All was in confusion in a moment, but
assistance quickly reached ihe prostrate
young woman, who was arrayed in all the
elegance of her wedding attire. Mr. Hoff
man, after his daughter had been cared
for, was in a great rase, and he picked up
the note and read it aloud to the excited
throng. Berninger wrote that he feared
the young woman did not love him enough
to be married, and he thought that at even
this late hour it would be better to back
out of his agreement than to take a step
that the two of them would prooanly re
gret the remainder of their lives. He
failed to explain, however, why he had
delayed making known his inUntious un
til the last minute, and great was the in
dignation of all present.
M;s-s Hoffman was carried to ber room.
Instead of recovering and forgetting her
cruel lover her condition has grown stead
ily worse. It is now feared that she will
become a victim of brain fever. Sunday
Hoffman went to Bernir.ger's house for
an explanation, but fearing the wrath of

RAGE OF A REJECTED SWAIN.
Clews Delta Shoots the Father and Brother
of the Girl Who Would Not
Marry Him.
SCHUYLER, Nkbb., Dec. B.â A shooting
affray occurred at midnight last night at
the home of Max Gleason, six miles from
here, in which Gleason's son, a young man
of 21 years, was shot through the heart
by Clews Delta, who wished to marry
Gleason's daughter. Opposition of the
parents to the marriage is said to be the
cause of the murder, and it is no fault of
Delta that he did not exterminate the
whole family. After killine the son be
fired three times at Mrs. Gleason without
effect. The father, who was in bed, sprang
up seized a shotgun and aimed it at Delta,
but the ciarge failed to explode. Delta
then turned on the old gentleman, shot
him in the forehead, and wresting the
shotgun from him. beat him on the head,
leaving l.im for dead. He then made his
escape. This morning the Sheriff formed
a posse and is scouring the country for
Dalta, who has not yet been captured.
POWELL'S ALLEGED DISCOVERY.
Going to Los Angeles to Prove That He
Has a Remedy That Will Revo
lutionize Medicine.
COLUMBIA. Mo., Dec B.â Dr. Thomas
Powell is going to Los Angeles, Cal. He
confidently believes he has made discov
eries in medicina which wilt revolutionize
science. He goes to Southern California
at the solicitation and expense of Chicago
capitalists and scientists, who will install
him in a sanitarium which will give him
an opportunity to test his new theory.
Dr. Powell is exceedingly reticent in re
gard to his discovery and absolutely re
fuses to disclose the nature of the remedy
except to say that it is physiological and
constitutional in character. He further
says that he has explained its character to
a few medical scholars, who agree with
him in saying it is entirely practical. The
preparation will insure immunity from
all diseases and is either fluid or solid in
form. Contrary to general belief it is not
a serum. Dr. Powell has written a paper
for the New York Medical" Review setting
forth his claims at great length.
RUSH OF VISITORS TO CANTON.
Oeneral King Vrgeu Onry of Maryland
for a Portfolio.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. Bâ^lt rained
steadily and furiously all day in Canton,
but no extreme Qr vagaries of the weather
are effective in checking the rising tide of
visitors at the McKinley residence.
When Major McKinley returned from
the station at 2 o'clock, whither he had
gone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Lafayette
Williams of Chicago, cousins of his wife,
be found people falling over each other in
the hallway and with no more than a
convenient amount of standing room in
his study. The commanding figure and
snow white hair of General Adam King
of Baltimore, formerly Consul-General to
Paris, first caught the eye of the Presi
dent-elect, and he invited him and his
colleague, Talbot I. Albert of Baltimore,
into another room for a private confer
ence. Genera! King and Mr. Talbot, who
are both Presidential electors, came to
Canton at the request of all the electors
and all the prominent Republicans of
Maryland to present to Major McKiniey
the formal indorsement of Maryland Re
publicans of James A. Gary of Baltimore
for a Cabinet position.
"Mr. Gary, said General Kine, "is a
man in every way fitted, we think, for the
Cabinet. He is a successful man of
affairs and is an efficient and ardent Re
puolican. He would make a very com
petent and I am sure a very popular
Cabinet officer. In view of the result of
t c recent election in our State we think
Mrryland worthy of recognition, and we
have united upon Mr Gary."
A score or more of other people bad

SILVER BOLTERS
REMAINED AWAY
Did Not Attend the Caucus
of the Republican
Senators.
Sentiment Expressed That It
Wou'd Not Bs Wisj to Take
Up the Dingley Bill.
Gsar Intimates Tbat He Will Push
Forward the Pacific Rends
Funding Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. OL, Dec. B.â A Re
publican Senatorial caucus was called to
meet at 10 o'clock this morning. Dubois,
Pettierrew, Mantle and Cannon, four of the
five bolting Senators now in this city, did
not attend, but held a conference of their
own in the committee-room of Dubois.
There was no discrimination in the mat
ter of notification in connection with the
caucus. The Senators, in accordance with
tbe uÂ«ual custom, are not invited. They
are simply notilicd that a caucus will bÂ«
held at a stated time and place.
These notices were sent yesterday to all
the belting silver Republicans and to Sen
ator Jones of Nevada. The only ex-Re
publican to whom one was not sent was
Senator Stewart of Nevada, who is con
sidered an out and out Populist.
Senator Dubois. in a note addressed to
Sherman, chairman of the ca'icus, re
signed the secretaryship of the caucus and
his membership on the steering commit
tee. This may be an indication of the
proposed policy of the free silver men to
refrain from hereafter affiliating with their
old-time colleagues.
Senator Wilson of Washington was
elected secretary in place of Dubois. A
friendly rivalry between Senators Sboup
oi Idaho and Hausbrough of South Dakota
for the vacancy on the steering committee
caused by the resi.Miatio'i of Duboia was
settled by putting ooth men on the com
mittee.
The chief topic for discussion was the
Dingley bill, with the result that the mat
ter was referred, without action, to the
steering committee. That committee will
consider the advisability of taking up the
Dingley bill and considering the possi
bility of passing it.
A consensus of opinion, gathered from
the short speeches made, was that it wouid
not be wise to take up the bill, as it would
be impossiole to get the votes to pass it.
Senator Wolcott of Colorado introduced a
resolution, which was unanimously adopt
ed, authorizing the chairman of tbe caucus
to appoint a special comuiittee of live Sen
ators whose duty it should be to devise
such legislation for action by this session
of Congress as will secure an international
monetary conference with tbe leading
commercial nations of the world.
Senaior Wolcott made a short speech
favoring the resolution. There was no
ODposition and tbe resolution was agreed
to without a dissenting voice.
Thfi debute on the Dingley bill was par
ticipated in by a dozen speakers. Hale
and Frys of Maine thought it expedient to
take up the measure and push it, while
Aid rich ot Rhode Island and Merrill of
Vermont were opposed to it.
Gear of lowa called the attention of the
steering committee to the fact that the
Pacific railroad refunding bill had been
referred to it last session and urged that
the committee maki> a report favoring
action this session. He threw out an inti
mation tbat he intended to force the
measure to the front should tbe com
mittee's report be unfavorable to prompt
action.
â â¦
TEN TO ONE. AGAINST IT.
Senator Perhina 6Â«y* ihe ltingley Bill
Can't PaÂ»Â» .'/Â»â¢Â« Seaainn.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. B.â Senator
Perkins, in conversation with the Caw>
correspondent, expressed the opinion that
there was little or no hope for passing the
Dingley tariff bill. He said ho beiieved
that tbe sentiment in California was about
evenly divided as to tbe expediency of
passing the Dingley bill at the short ses
sion, or waiting until the next session and
passing a more sweeping measure of pro
tection. The Senator said that be bad
hoped tbe Dingley bill could be passed, so
that the tariff agitation might be over
with and confidence restored among busi
ness men who were anxious about tbe
outcome.
Senator Perkins was not the only one of
the prominent participants in to-days
Republican Senatorial caucus, but he is a
rremb^r of the Republican steering cora
mitiee, which in conjunction with a iike
committee of the Democrats practically
shaves the order of business in the Senate.
The failure of the bolting silver Repub
licans (except Jones of Nevada) io enter
to-day's caucus causes endless speculation
as to* whether these silver Senators have
alienated themselves forever irom the
Republican party. Some of the sialwart
siraight-ont Republicans declare that
gradually, and one by one, the stay-away
Senators will cone home like little Bo
peep's sheep, wagcing their tails behind
them, and that they will be glad enough
to get back into the fold. All but Dubois,
who, by reason of the failure of his fusion
programme in Idaho, is to be led bleating
to the butcher's block at Boise this winter.
Senator Perkins said to The Call corre
spondent that he had not yet received a
copy of the memorial of the California
fruit-growers, asking Congress to grant
protection on their oranges, prunes and
other California products, but that as soon
as it arrived he would present it to the
Senate and have it referred to the Com
mittee on Finance.
He said the chanc s were ten to one the
Dingley bill would not be resurrected in
the Senate, but if it was called up he
would endeavor to have it amended so as
to grant the protection asked lor Califor
nia products. Senator Perkins said that,
in his opinion, the ad valorem system oi
levying tariff duties was all wrong. It
tended to promote dishonesty among ap
praisers of merchandise and consular
officers.
He believes that specific duties should
he levied instead of ad valorem. Senator
Perkins said that there was now a chance
for the Pacific Blope to be represented on
the Ways and Weans Committee, which
originates all revenue measures, for the
first time since Judge McKenna of Cali
fornia was a member of it.
The Pacific Coast mÂ»n will make an
earn- st effort to have Representative Fran
cis G. Newlands of Nevada appointed to
succeed Judge Crisp of Georgia, deceased.
Senator Perkins presented a high tribute
to Mr. Newlands and pronounce i him a
man of ability and brilliant oratory,
a man who, as a member of tho
Ways and Means Committee, wouid re
flect credit upon his State and the entire
Pacific Coast and be enabled to render im
portant service to that resion. The Pa
cific Coast men will see Speaker Reed and
urge that Mr. NewUnds be appointed. It
is believed that Speaker Reed, having re
cently visited California and other Pacific
Coast States, where he was royally re
ceived, returned Eust fully impressed with
the grandeur of the Pacific Coast States,
their vaÂ»t and varied resources and im
portance in tbe commercial world, and re
solved that this section of the country
should receive better treatment at the
nands of Congress. Mr. Reed feels very
grateful, especially to the California peo
ple, for their kind treatment of liim, and
if they unite in urging Mr. Newiands' ar
pointmeiu that gentleman may be thus
highly honored.
RAVAGES OF THE PLAGUE.
Hundreds of Deaths Cause Fanic-Stncken
Natives to Flee Frcm
Bombay.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. B.â A special
cable to the Herald from Bombay says
that the plague, while spreading in Bom
bay, has been confined almost wholly to
that city. Eisht Hundred deaths are re
ported up to date, but the number is be
lieved to be much larger. Crowds of panic
stricken natives are ileeing from the city.
The famine which threatened the whole of
India has been partially averted in certain
districts by the recent rains.
A special dispatch to the Herald from
Singapore says: The sanitary state of
Singapore has not been good during the
last two years. In tbe middle of last year
an outbreak of cholera occurred, involv
ing tbe deaths of over two hundred per
sons before subsiding. In October of this
year a similar outbreak oocurred. It was
confined, however, almost entirely to
Asiatics, especially Chinese coo'ies, only
one or two Europeans or Eurasiuns hav
ing been attacked. The dryness of the
season doubtless had much to do wifh
the prevalence of cholera and intermittent
fevers.
Since the rains set in the amount of
sickness has diminished un<i cholera has
disappeared, and there have been no cases
of plague. A similar condition of affiirs
has been experienced all over the far East,
but tbe health of the town has now much
improved.
COMBINE OF DISTILERS

Steep Aasesatncnt.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. The meeting
place of tbe secret conference of distillers
was changed to-day from some unknown
room in Chicago to Peona, the city of dis
tilleries, and the whisky-makers left their
hiding-place long enough to go to the
railway station. The conference has not
reached the agreement stage yet, but the
negotiations are said to be almost com
pleted. The object of the visit to Peoria
was to remove one of the obstacles. The
contract for a defensive and offensive alli
ance is said to provide for a guaranty fund
of $500,000, to be raised by an assessment
of lrom 2 to 5 cents a gallon of product,
according to the output of the plant?, to
be repaid if t:ie terms of the agreement
are not violated. It is said the Wilson &
W< olner distillery >of Peoria protested
against theaiz< of their assessment, claim
ing their importance in the trade did not
warrant the tax, and several of the smaller
distillers who have also a grievance as to
the recognition accorded their claims by
the Anioricnn Company, supported the
Wilson &' Woolner opposition. "Accord
ingly, the trip to Peoria was made for the
purpose of reaching a .air decision, based
on ocular proof and personal obseiV-ilion

SUGGESTIONS IS
TO THE CURRENCY
Comptroller Eckels Makes
Recommendations in
His Report.
Proposed Relief in Amendments
to the National Banking
Act.
Branch Banks Said to B? a Gcod
Mtdium of Securing a Better
Distribution.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. BâComp
troller of the Currency Eckels has consid
erable to say in bis annual report about
financial stringency and congestion, and
he makes remedial suggestions of inter
est. Various amendments to the na
tional banking act, looking to giving re
lief, are proposed by the Comptroller,
among them the following:
"Tbat in places having a population of
less than 2000 inhabitants national banks
shall be permitted, under regulations to
De made by the Comntroller of t'.e Cur
rency and approved by the Secretary of
the Treasury, to bfl organized, with a capi
tal stock of not less than $25,000, and with
a corresponding reduction in the amount
of bonds required to be deposited with the
Treasurer of the United States.
"That national banks be permitted, un
der such regulations and restrictions as
shall be made by the Comptroller of the
Currency and approved by the Secretary
of tbe Treasury, to establish branch banks
in towns and villages where no national
banks are established and where the
population does not exceed 1000 inhabiN
ants, such branch banks to have the right
to receive deposits, make loans and dis
counts and buy ami sell exchange, but in
no case to be permitted to issue circulat
ing notea other than that of the parent
bank."
In support of his recommendation for
the establishment of branch baiiKs the
Comptroller says: "The construction
placed upon the national-bank act an now
in force by the Supreme Court precludes
the establishing and maintaining of branch
banks under it"; and he continues: "The
permitting of branch banks would be the
forming of agencies through which a bet
ter distribution of currency could and
would be made." Further on in his report
he remark..- that "the time must come
when the banks should be such agencies of
distribution of loanable capiial as will
make credit everywhere equally available
to the extent that those seeking it are
justly entitled. So, too, must a point
be finally reached when banks shall issue
ail the credit currency of the country and
stand wholly responsible, instead of the
Government, for its redemption in gold
coin whenever and in whatever quantities
presented."
Further on in his report the Comptrol
ler remarks: "A policy in finance wrong
in principle never becomes right in pracr
t-ce. Ttie triuu of tbe statement fs fully
illustrated by the course of the legal ten
der treasury issues ot the United States.
They have been always a disturbing ele
ment in business and their current re
demption a continuing weakness and
anxiety to the treasury."
He recommends "that legislation by
Congress, based upon safe and prudent
lines, having in view the eradual pay
ment and cancellation of the credit cur
rency now maintained by the Govern
ment and the issuance hereafter of all of
such currency through the banks, with
lull responsibility therefor placed upon
them, should be had at ihe very earliest
practicable moment. The result? which
would follow such enactments would bÂ»
beneficial and neither would monopoly be
created nor luyor shown thcr'by."
Plan of a (ennii Service.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. B.â Carroll
D. Wripht, Commissioner of Labor, sent
to Congress to-day his report upon a plan

joint resolution of March 19, 1896, Mr.
Wright is satisfied that the true principles
on which a permanent census to do the
work of decennial censuses stiould be
carried â¢ ut. are to be found in reports al
reauy made to Congress. The expense of
conducting a permanent census bureau
and taking a decennial census Mr. Wright
estimated at an average of $800,000 a year.

MONTREAL, Qt/ebec, Dec. 8. â The
most disastrous tire Montreal has experi
enced for a long time broke out shortly
before 8 o'clock this evening in one of the
upper stories in the center of the Barron
â  block, on St. James street, extending from
John street to St. Francis Xavier street,
facing St. Lawrence Hall. The lire was in
the most dangerous locality in the very
heart of the city, and in the immediate
vicinity of the Temple building, the
Standard Life Insurance building, the
postoffice, Carsley'* big department store,
the Canada Life Insurance and other great
business structures.
The upper stories of the Barron block
' are occuniea by offices of various kinds,
while the around floors are occupied by
Fulton & Richards. Freeman's restaurant,
A. W. Ross & Co., Gibbs it Capo, the Cen
, tral Vermont and Intercolonial Railway
ticket offices, and other smaller offices.
The fire spread with alarming rapidity,
and when the fire brigade reached the
scene the flames were shooting out of the
middle of the block, while dense clouds of
spark? rose and fell on St. Lawrence Hall,
the postoffice and other stmctures, plac
ing them in imminent danger. The whole
brigade was calied out and the firemen
made desperate efforts to stop the prog
ress of the flames. The water-towers and
other apparatus were brought into requi
sition, but at fir-st the volume of water did
not 6eem to have much effect and the
flames rose with increasing fury.
The fire spread to the old Bank of
Toronto building, at the corner of St. John
and St. James streets, and it was soon
. a mass ot flames. WhiJe the firemen were
â¢ working on this building tbe corner wail
. fell out, sending a wave of flames across
' ' the street.
After burning for three hours with ter
rible fury, the fire was got under control
' shortly after 10 o'clock. The Barron
block, valued at $300,000, is a complete
â  wreck. Â«
Among those who occupied the offices

BESTS OF PACIFIC RAILROADS.
Although the Refunding Bill Cannot Pass
Huntmgton and His Crowd Are
on the Alert
NEW YORK, N\ V., Dec. B.â A Times
special from Washington says: A careful
canvass and weighing of probabilities sat
isfies the Pacific Railroads crowd that
there is small prospect of the passage of
the refunding bill this session. Too many
big interests are arraying themselves in
opposition.
A strong attempt to secure the needed
legislation will be made, however, and it
is rep rted that the Union Pacific reor
ganization committee will make a definite
alternative proposition to pay the Govern
ment a lump sum for its equities in that
property. How HuiitinztorT stands with
regard to that proposition is not known,
the companies standing on a somewhat
different basis.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. B.â lt is
the purpose of Powers (R.)of Vermont,
chairman of the House Committee on Pa
eMc Railways, to arrange with Speaker
Reed for an early consideration of tne bill
reported at the last session to adjust tne
indebtedness of the Pacific roads to the
Government. This falls due within a few
weeks, and a settlement of the matter was
deemed of sufficient importance by Presi
dent Cleveland to justify a reference to it
in hi< annual message which was laid be
fore Congress. Mr. Powers said to-day
that he did not doubt the Committee on
Rules would report an order setting aside
a few days for consideration of the meas-
ure. He is well satisfied that the urgency
of the case is such that the House will
pass the bill, as it is not a party meas
ure nor one in his judgment on which
there should be a difference of opinion in
the House.
Senator Perkins, a member of the Sen
ate steering committee, says a desperate
effort will be made this winter to pass the
Pacific roads refunding bill. The matter
was brought up in caucus this morning
and discussed at considerable length.
Senator Perkins if, of course, not at lib
erty to divulge caucus secrets, and was re
luctant to talk at all. but it is well known
here to-night tnat the caucus referred the
matter of the refunding bill to the steer
ing committee and it is altogether
â¢ probable that the bill will soon come up
in the Senate and will pas- that body in
spite of the fight that wiil be led by Sen
ator Morgan, backed by Senators White
: and Perkins. Senator White's absence
; may delay action for a while at least.
Senator Perkins says the opponents of the
bill could occupy tlie time of the Senate In
a discussion of the measure and this would
give the Los Angeles Senator time to
reach Washington.
Representative Powers, chairman of the
House Committee on Pacific Railroads,
suid to The Call correspondent to-night
that the committee would ask the Hues
Committee to allow tliree or four days for
the bill's consideration, but he did not
know vet whether the time ask*>d for
be before or after the holidays. He ex
pres^d the opinion that the bill would
pass the House. Q'bis is the opinion of
nearly every one familiar with the situa
tion. It will also probably pass the Sen
ate and be signed by President Cleveland.
There lias never been a time when t.'.e
chances for the refunding scheme were so
favorable as they are now.

CHICAGO, 111., Dec. B.â Secretary
Robert E. Burke of the Cook County Dem

for the purpose of inviting William J.

It ii said that Mr. Burke will also repre
sent Governor Altgeht in aconference with
Mr. Brvnn to obtain his ndvice and views
on the question on uniting tbe Dt?raocra:ic
forces oi the city for the municipal elec

sion among the silver Democrats, the Gov
ernor and his followers in the party ma
chine advocating an independent course,
so as to keep up the silver agitation for the
campaign of 1900. His supporters, how
ever, are said to be in the minority and
there is strong talk of deposing the Gov
ernor from the leadership of the pany in
the State and city unless a compromise
agreement is reached.

Portland Woman Drives a Steel

PORTLAND. Ob., Dec. B.â The strangest
case of remarkable vitality ever having
come under the observation of the surgical
fraternity here is that of Mrs. Benjamin
L. Jones of 513 East Eighteenth street,
who in a novel way attempted suicide last
Wednesday night. The woman drove a
steel spite into her brain to a depth of five
inches, but will recover.
The entire family was busily engaged at
6 o'clock in dressing fowls for the market.
Watching her opportunity, Mrs. .lones
quietly arose from the group and made
her way out of the room to the kitchen
pantry. She had evidently prepared for
what followed, for usually the implements
used by the unfortunate woman were tn
different parts of tbe house.
Grasping an ice pick and hatchet the
demented woman placed the point of the
former against her right temple and with
successive blows from the hatchet drove
the steel inch by inch through her skull
and into the brain until the Haft of the
wooden handle of the ice pick stopped it."

The woman was taken to the Good Sa
maritan Hospital, where tbe spike was
taken out of her head. A nurse says that,
despite the fact that the five inches of
steel had penetrated Mrs. Jones' .-knl;
into the brain, she has had several com
paratively lucid moments. She would in
quire as to her family, where she was and
what ailed her. Then she would relapse
into an unconscious state of perhaps forty
eight hours' duration.
To-night Mrs. Jones is in a more critical
condition tiian at any time since her sui
cidal attempt and her death before mid
night is expected.
LIFES WITH CLEFT SKULJ*.
Frightful Injury to a Man Who Tried to
Stop n Runaway Unrt-. : -
LOS ANGELEg, Cal., The voices of a
man and woman are pathetically min
gled in the Receiving Hospital here to
night. The former is a crazed, oelplesf,
dying man, who in a heroic attempt to
stop a runaway horse attached to a street
car received a blow at the base of the
brain which cracked his skull open from
ear to oar.
This happened on Main street this fore
noon, where the hapless victim was work
ing upon the track of the railway com
pany.
The man is A. A. Allen. His agonizing
but muffled groans may be heard through
out the building. He retains His physical
powers in a remarkable degree, and two
strong laborers have all they can do to
hold him upon the Hospital cot, while he
calls out in heartrending tones tor bi<
wife and children.
While his utterances are remarkably
distinct, and he seems at times to possess
his senses unimpaired, he does not recog
nize his distressed but faithful companion,
who has remained by bis side every mo
ment since the accident, crying aloud as
he shrieks in torture.
Allen, the doctors say, must die before
sunrise. The wonder is that he should
have lived thirty minutes after the acci
dent, with his skull reft in twain. The
agony of the grief-str cken wife, who can
do nothing to relieve his agony, has ren
dered the hospital anything but a cheerful
place to-night. Neither opiates nor pal
liatives of any kind seem to have any
effect in alleviating the distress of the
dying laborer.
BULLET FOUND IN HIS BRAIN.
flohn i*. Kelly't ttuictde Aernmyliihec
After Days of WniUnij.
SAN JOBE, Cal., Dec. B.â An autopsy
to-day upon the body of John P. Kelly,
the jeweler who tried to kill his wife and
then turned a revolver upon himself
about ten days ago, showed that a 32
-caliber bullet had penetrated the brain
about three inches. That Kelly lived for
ten days with a bullet in his brain is
remarkable. The caliber of the ball is
proof that the wound was inflicted by
Kelly and not by Officer Prindiville, as at
first supposed. An inquest will be held
to-morrow. Keily will be buried by Mrs.
Kelly, who is rapidly recovering.
Kelly's will was filed for probate this
afternoon by Policeman John Haley, who
is named as executor. The value of the
estate is placed at $5000. It consists of a
lot of jewelry stored in Ban Francisco,
valued at $40C0; fixtures and tools in a
store in this city, wearing apparel worth
$Â£66, and real estate near San Diego of
unknown value. The property is left to
John Haley in trust for Mary and Nellie
Kelly, his two small children, with the
exception of 10 cents, which is equally
divided between James Kelly and Mrs.
Annie Micnatl, children by a former wife
residing in San Diego. Mr. Kelly is
totally ignored.

Schoch, the winner in 1893. by steady
plodding, worked up into third position,
thus increasing the hopes of many who
think he can reach the victory.
Furster kept close on Reading and of
the next division, Moore, Taylor, Smith

The third lot, Asuinger, Elkes, Glick,

Thatcher opened up well and banging
the Ivories hard, relying principally on
general results, had at the end of the
eiihtu inning 57 to Gallagher's 9. The
latter then Â£i>t them rolling to his liking
nnd gathered 53 before he walked to his
chair. This was his highest run. He went
along at a ten gait during the next four

losing whatever chance he had.
Thatcher in the meantime kept ham

Disaster at the Mountain

at Keswick.
Twelve Workmen Reported Dead
and N:arly as Many
Injured.
Corps of Physicians Dispatched From
BedJing to Care for th:
Unfortunates.
REDDING, Cal., Dec. B.â A terrific ex
plosion of gasoline and coal oil occurred at
Kcswick, five miles from this city, to-night
at 8 o'clock. The scene of the disaster
was the oilhouse of the Mountain Mines
Company, situated about 300 yards from
the company's big smelters and about 100
yards from its office and store. Meager re
ports received by telephone stated that of
the twenty men at work around the oil
house twelve were killed outright and all
of the others more or less injured. Eight
physicians were at once dispatched from
Redding to care for the injured.
The cause of the explosion is not known
here. Except for the first information re
ceived by telephone nothing could be
learned. At the mines there was the wild
est excitement, Jrtid the men in charge at
the company's office refused to give any
information in answer to anxious inquiries
from this city.
The explosion was not heard in Red
ding, but several persons saw a greatsheet
of flame shoot into the air ana illuminate
the country for miles around. The dis
aster occurred in a small wooden house,
in which was stored a large quantity of
gasoline, coal oil and oil used at the
smelter. The building was completely
wrecked, and timbers, cans and pieces of
debris were thrown hundreds of feet from
the spot. None of the other buildings of
the company were destroyed or damaged,
though the buildings containing the rock
breakers were badly shaken, these struc
tures being just across a sixty-foot street
from the wrecked oilhouse.
A NOTHERJ RUDY RECOVERED.
Belief That Seven Men . Inntead of Six i
Were Lost from 'the ban Benito.
POINT ARENA, Cal.; Dec. B.â The sea !
ha? given up one more of its victims. A !
body was seen last night, but owing to the j
rough nature of the coast it was not re- i
covered until this morning. It was found j
about throe . miles north of the wrecKed j
San Benito. Justice Ainslie held an in- i
quest upon the body, and the jury found j
that it was that of a boy about 16 years !
old, 5 feet 3 inches in height and weighing
about 125 pounds. The face and head 'â 
were badly mutilated. V. A. flannel under- !
shirt and a pair of light shoes and stock- j
ings were all that remained of the cloth- j

The description does not tally with
that oi any of the crew lost, and the j
body is believed to be that of a boy who j
was not on the ship's books, but who j
was working his way down. This con
firms the opinion that seven lives weie j
lost instead of, six. '

KILLING FROSTS
IN WASHINGTON
Thousands of Fruit Trees
Blighted by Frigid
Weather.
Total Destruction of a Large
Number of Orchards in
Bearing.
Importations From California Must
Be Made to Supply tbe
Demaad
TACOMA, Wash.. Dec. B.â The greatest
damage by the recent cold weather is just
now coming to light. Heavy frosts have
caused the total destruction of a large
number of orchards, both on Puget Sound
and across the Cascado Mountains. Prune,
peach and apple trees have been destroyed
by the thousand. The apple trees are
thcught to be damaged the least.
Ednor Fcobey of the Olympian, pub
lished at Olympia, brought the news to
day that practically all the Italian prune
trees in Thurston County were frozen by
the severe weather of the later part of
November, when for a week the mercury
ranged from 10 to 32 degrees above zero.
He estimated the loss in Thurston County
alone at 100,000 trees, many of them of
four, five and six years' growth, and some
bearing this year for the first time. Mr.
Scobey says he has no doubt that when
the trees are examined in all parts ot
Western Washington, where the weather
was extremely c^'ld, they will be found
lifeless*.
At Olympia the mercury dropped to a
little below zero. At Walia Walla and in
Whitman County it went down to twenty
degrees below zero, killing thousands of j
trees. As cold weather as that is ex peri- |
enced every year, but not so early in the
season. The fall has been unusually
pleasant and warm, with Ihe result that
much sap was still left in the bodies of the
trees. When the weather suddenly j
changed from summer to extreme winter
it froze the sap.
Reports from the Yakima and We
natchee valleys further north are to the
same effect. Peach and Italian prune i
trees suffered the most there, . Not since !
18S1 has such severe weather been experi
enced in the Northwest in November.
Tne fruit-growers are badly discouraged,
but as rapidly as possible will replenish
their orchards with new trees.
Fruit-raising has been counted one of
the prospective great industries of the
State on account of the splendid product
raised here and the fine market obtained
in the East. During the past season over
600 carloads of prunes and other green |
fruit were shipped from Walla Walla !
alone. Commencing six or seven years
ago a large proportion of new settlers pur
chased fruit land either along Puget
Sound or the valleys of Eastern Washing
ton. Both the soil and the climate of the '
Puget Sound country have been pro
nounced by experts to be particularly fa
vorable to the growth of prunes, and hun
dreds have engaged in the business.
Many growers expected to get their first
full crop next year and were preparing to
erect dryers. Now they must wait six or
seven years more. The damage is found j
to be greatest on the uplands away from i
the water.
It is understood that Orchards in Oregon
sustained similar though perhaps less ex
tensive damages. Because of home pro
duction importations of California fruit
have been growing smaller for a number
years, but they will now have to be de
pended upon to again supply the North
western market.
SANTA CRIZ HOTEL PROJECTS.
Colonel Peahen jftai/ Amsuine Control of
the S'a Ileneh Houte.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec- B.â The hotel
qu stion here is still unsettled.. The Pa
cific Ocean House, which was closed last
Thursday on account of the declaration
of insolvency of John R. Chacc, proprie
tor, has not been reopened. The hotel
cannot be put into operation until the
mortgage held by the Bank of Santa Cruz
for $8475 is satisfied; but the F. A. Hihu
Company, owner of the building, can de
mand that the premises be vacated by the
holder.of the mortgage, ana when that is
done establish another set of hotel ma
chinery within the building and put that
into operation. It is now probable that
this nlan will be adopted and that Mrs.
Piiley will remove her establishment
known as The Pixley to the Pacific Ocean
House.
Colonel Peakes of Stocktonâ the "Papa
Peafces" of . the late Midwinter Fair
Forty-nine Mining returned home
to-day. No positive statement has been
given out as to his intentions, but it is
generally believed that he will become the
boniface of the Sea Beach Hotel.

BAN JOSE CLAIMS REJECTED.
Supervisors of Santa Clara County In
vite a Contett.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. B.â A claim of
511,767, made by the city of San Jose against
the county of Santa Ciara for services per
formed by the city Justice in State cases
since January, 1881, has been rejected by
the Board of Supervisors. The claim is
Dased upon the assumption that, since the
city of San Jose pays the salary of the
City Justice, all State business, which in
cluded most of the criminal business of
the court, should be paid for to the city at
the same rate as the county pays the other
Justices for the transaction of its business
under the State laws.
The items in the claim date bam to
January, ISBI, and include all the State
rnminai business transacted up to June
23, 1896, which, at $3 fcr every complaint
issued, aggregates $11,767. The case will
proDably be carried to the courts.

The Kirmesa of Xationa.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Dec. 8 âThe Kirmess
of Nations, at Turn Verein Hall, under
the auspices of the Catholic Ladies' Aid
Society, was well attended this afternoon
and evening. The programme was in
charge of the French booth, and fine
musical numbers were rendered. Vocal
solos were sung by Miss Lena Voitz, Miss
Clara Sweigert and Henry Dykmans. A
French minuet was also danced on the
stage. Dancing in an adjoining hall fol
lowed the entertainment.
Looted by Burglar*.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. B.â P. Haagen's
fish-market, on South First street, was
entered by burglars last night. A waich
and gold locket and chain and several
other pieces of jewelry were taken. En
trance was effected through a rear window.
Preparing for Cloterdnlt't Fair.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Dec. 8. â The
stockholders of the Cloverdale Citrus Fair
Association held their annual election last
night. The directors chosen for the en
suing year were: Captain John Field,
president; F. Albertz, vice-president; M.
Menihan, Charles E. Humbert and F. W.
Brush, trustees. George B. Baer was arj
pointed secretary and the Bank of Clover
dale treasurer. The president's report for
the past year shows the uffairs of tne asso
ciation to be in a nourishing condition.
The large pavilion is about completed and
new stock is being subscribed for almost
every day. Preparations for the dedica
tion exercises and masquerade ball are
going on merriiy. The citrus fair will be
held about the middle of February.
SAILORS GIVE TESTIMONY.
One of the British Witnesses at Victoria
Admits That He Pre
varicated.
VICTORIA, B. Oh Dec. B.â Before the
Bering Sea Commission, William T.
Bragg, mate of the schooner Mary Ellen
in 1886, was examined as to the catches
his vessel made in Bering Sea during that
season. He stated that the whole catch
of the schooner was 2395, or including the
coast catch 4264, the high line catch of
any vessel until 1894.
Next, Owen Thomas, who was pilot of
the Carolena in the spring of 1886, stated
that the object of the trip to Neuchatlitz
in that February was not to trade, but to
secure an Indian crew, and though sup
plies were landed as stated by Witness
Spring on Monday, they were taken on
board again as an Indian crew could not
be secured.
Parts of the evidence of Andrew Lang,
who i 3 ill in bed, were read, stating that
the schooner W. P. Sayward had caught
seals in Bering Sea in 1887 and admit
ting that the declaration he had made
.after the seizure of the vessel that no
skins had been takeu by the Sayward in
Bering Sea was not true. This last state
ment whs used by the United States Con
sul to attack the credibility of the witness.
Victor Jacob on, captain and owner of
the schooner Mountain Chief, in his evi
dence as to his 18S7 ciicb, stated the num
ber 1182, a? given in the official' report of
the fisheries department, was not correct
and was guesswork, as he had not re
ported to the department, nor were the
sealers in 1880 or 1887 required by the
Government to report the number of their
catch.
Captain J. f). Warren, the next witness,
whose schooner, the Dolphin, was seized
by the Kush in 1887, gave his catch in 1886
a? 2205 in Bering Sea and explained that
the figures he had compiled at Ottawa
when the claims first came up did not
exactly tally in some instances with the
figures now given because he had not then
been in a position to get as definite in
formation.
Captain William O'Leary of the schooner
Pathfinder said he brought the schooner
out of Bering Sea before the season was
over both in 1880 and 1887 because he was
afraid of seizure. He had in 1880 1700
skins aboard, all but 300 having been taken
in Bering Sea. Gustav Hansen, master of
the German schooner Adeia, gave the
same reason as Captain O'Leary for not
staying all the season of 1886 in Bering
Sea, and Emil Bambosa, who was on the
Theresa, which sealed through the season
of 1886, said his schooner caught 2100
skins.
CRAZED BY HIS IMAGINATION,
Mental Collapse of a Youth Who Be-
lieved He Had Heart Disease.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. B.â F. O. Green,
who has been residing with his brother
:iear Clovis. was to-day committed to the
Stockton Insane Asylum by Judge Webb.
The case is a very peculiar one. The case
is a very peculiar one. The cause of the
unfortunate man's insanity was the imag
ination that he had heart disease and
was in danger of dropping dead at any
moment. The physicians made an ex
amination to-day and found that his heart
was in a healthy condition. The imag
ined affliction preyed upon the young
man's mind, however, until it was unbal
anced. He refused to live in his brother's
house, and spent the greater part of his
time in an outbuilding. He was consid
ered harmless until a few days ago, when
he procured a shotgun and began dis
charging it recklessly about the place.

The Los Angsles Reformer
Aspires to Become a
Policeman.
Petition in His Behalf Signed
by Parkhurst Society
Members.
The Effort to Secure His Appoint*
ment Follows a S umming
Expedition.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. B. âThe
latest move of the Parkhurst Society of
this city is a peculiar and unusual one. It
contemplates the appointment of Rev. C.
C. McLean of Simpson M. E. Church as a
special policeman. This gentleman is at
the head of the law and order committee
of the society. In company with a few
theological students Dr. McLean spent
several recent nights "slumming" it
among the dives and saloons of the dis
orderly sort. The petition to the Board of
Police Commissioners for McLean's ap
pointment follows:
We, the undersigned citizens of Los Angeles,
respectfully request your tionorable body to
appoint C. C. McLean as a special officer with
out pay.
The petition was at once referred to
Chief Glass, who said: "I would never
recommend such an appointment. I don't
see why this man wan fit to be a special
police officer."
Several cases brought by the society
were down for consideration to-day in the
Police Court, but all ot them were con
tinued. Rev. Mr. McLean And other mem
bers of the society were present.
ACCUSES HER DEAD HUSBAND.
Los Angeles Widow Claims She Was
Robbed of Her Estate.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. B.â Suit was
brought here to-day by Amy 11. Darling,
relict of A. F. Darling, long a wealthy resi
dent of this city, against Judge John D.
Works, executor of what purports to have
been the last will and testament of the de
ceased husband, aud the minor children,
William R., May Elizabeth, Emma Ella
and Andrew Francis Darling.
Mrs. Darling alleges that at the time of
her marriage with the deceased he had no
separate estate. Some time thereafter her
father, William Rhodes, died at St. Paul,
Minn., and left her between $8000 and
$10,000. It became necessary for some one
to attend to her inheritance, and her hus
band decided to go. She gave him, as she
thought, a simple power of attorney. He
went to St. Paul, settled the business and
received the inheritance. Upon his return
he invested the money in Hunter's High
land V.ew Tract, containing about fifteen
acres, and for fourteen years they resided
upon a portion of the land. The plaintiff
alleges that the property was regarded by
her and by her husband as her separate
estate.
After her husband's death she was
broken down physically and mentally
and went to what she afterward ascer
tained, but did not know at the time, was
a private sanitarium, conducted by Dr.
John W. Robertson at Livermore, Cal.,
where sbe remained several months. She
alleges that recently she has ascertained
that instead of giving her husband a
power of attorney when he went to look
after her inheritance it was in reality a
trust deed, by which she conveyed the in
heritance to her husband in trust for the
children.
In view of all this alleged subterfuge
and deception the plaintiff asks the court,
in pursuance of her allegations, to declare
the trust deed and the latter deed abso
lutely void and decree that the property
in question is her separate estate.
FELL INTO CHRISTMAS BANDS.
Runaway Alice hodticrs Heard From by
Her .Parents.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. B.â Alice
Rodgers, aged 16 years, whose parents
\ reside in East Los Angeles, mysteriously
j disappeared on November 30. Chief Glass
was notified and did all he could to
locate the runaway. This morning the
parents of the girl received a letter from
her dated "San F.-ancsioo, December 6,"
in which she states that siie left home in
order to lighten domestic expense; that
she is now heim; cared for by the Young
Women's Christian Association in San
Francisco, and will shortly go to work in
a large dry goods store. She toll I her
mother not to worry about her; that she
is in good hands and intends to lead a
Christian life.
Chief Glass wired to San Francisco and
received a reply to the effect that the
girl's statement was true and that she
would be looked after.

CAME BEFORE THE FORTY-NINERS
Death of the Venerable Mrs. C. 0. Hosford
at Her Mountain Home Near
Portland.
PORTLAND, Ok., Dec. B.â Mrs. C. O.
Hosford, wife of Rev. C. O. Hostord, died
at her home on the western slope of
Mount Tabor last night She had been
ailing more or less for the past three years,
and her death was not wholly unexpected.
During her long sickness she maintained
her character as a sturdy pioneer woman,
and bore her afflictions with patience and
firmness.
Mr?. Hosford was among the very early
pioneers, first of California and then of
Oregon. She went to California with her
two brothers from Kentucky in 1843, and
was one of the five or six women who were
in the territory of California. She was
married in . the Golden State. With her
husband &he came to Oregon in 1849,
and settled on a donation land claim at
Salem. Mr. Hosford became a Methodist
missionary in the new country, his wife
sharing all the hardships and privationÃ
incident to such work at that time. She
greatly supplemented hia work by her
helping hand, and not a few still survive
to remember her kindly deeds among tue
early settlers.
In 1861 the Hosfords moved to their
present home, which is on the western
slope of Mount Tabor, where they have
lived for the past thirty- five years. No
woman of the neighborhood was wider or
better known than Mrs. Hosford. Her
ChrlÃtiun character was exemplified in her
everyday life. When she died she had
rounded out 68 years ami 11 months. She
had eight children, six of whom are now
living in Portland. Her venerable hus
band survives her.

some months ago, and v new trial was
granted on appeal.
Mrs. H. C. Butler, the teacher to whom
the upbraiding was offered, is the principal
witness, and a score of bright-faced
children were also on hand to testify. The

holiday occurrence, but raiher viewed the
proceeding with profound awe and respect,
and testified with great solemnity. Mr.
Starke claims to have Deen insulted by
the pupils of Mrs. Butler's school, and,
therefore, upbraided both teacher and
scholars.

Aid for the Projectors of
the Proposed Line of
Steamships.
The Plans of Potter and Butler
Outlined at a Meeting
of Citizens.
Subscriptions to Stcck in the Enter*
prise to Be Solicited Without
Delay.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dae. B.â Tbe Potter-
Butler proposition for creating a trans
pacific steamship line, with termini at
San Dieco and Yokohama, was publicly
discussed at Fisher's Opera-house to-night
by an audience that taxed the capacity of
the building. Mr. Potter was the first
speaker. He was introduced by President
Philip Morse of the Chamber of Com
merce as a man high in financial circles
of Chicago, and one who was accustomed
to carrying out any undertaking he en
gaged in. Mr. Potter said he had been
at work on the matter two years.
"I cast about for the best American
port," he said, "and fixed upon San Diego
by reason of its geographical position, its
fine climate and immunity irom ice, snow
and blockades on the railroads, and also
by reason of its railroad connections.
The Santa Fe Company owns its own line
aud rails direct from the bay of San Diego
to Chicago, making the best overland road
on the continent.
"Now the plan of operation is substan
tially this: To build steamships of at
least 8000 tons register and twenty knots
speed. I aim at the first-class only. To
make fortnightly trips will require four
steamers, and to build them will require
about $6,500,000. To operate them will re
quire a capital of about $8,000,000. We
propose to incorporate with a capital
stock of $5,000,000. S:ock subscriptions
for that amount, however, cannot be ob
tained in these times, and so only $3,000,
-000 will be issued. We must, therefore,
issue bonds, secured by steamships, which
1 have every assurance can be placed.
We shall issue $5,000,000 fci bonds to run
ten years.
"We do not come here begging for sub
scriptions, and it the line is organized at
all it will come to San Diego. But we do
ask that Southern California make a sub
stantial effort to aid us, and show that we
have the moral and financial support so
far as you are able of this part of the coun
try. I have assurances from Eastern capi
talists that the amount of money required
will be forthcoming. '
A speech wat also made by Mr. Butler,
who has been at work on the matter for
two years past, both in the United States
and in Japan. Mr. Butler is a large
shipper of cotton, and is interested in the
proposition as a shipper to the Orient.
He Â»aid the proposition was the most
teasible tnat he had- been able to find
one that was offered to a community but
rarely â and that the future of San Diego
as a' maritime port was assured if tbe
project was carried through.
Other speeches were made by local capi

OFATION TO DIAZ.
Demonstration in ihe President's Honor
at Guadalojarn.
BAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 8.-President
Diaz of Mexico arrived in the city of
GuadHlajara on Sunday morning after a
trip through the intervening cities and
towns that took on the nature of a
triumph. The popularity of Mexico s
chief executive was never so manifest
among all classes of his countrymen.
Banners waved, bands played and troops
were lined up to receive him as he
traveled.
At Guadalajara a great demonstration
wa3 made. The troops of that city and
vicinity were massed on the public
squares and volleys were fired as the dis
tinguished visitors arrived. The military
and civil authorities of the city and of the
State of Jalisco greeted the President and
extended the heartiest welcome.
The poorer people were present in great
numbers and many of them who had
fought with Diaz in the wars were recog
nized by him and received a wave of the
h3t or a'handsbake from "Don Parflrito,
as the older Mexicans affectionately refer
to him. The Guild of Caraadores of Gua
dalajara presented to General Diaz a life
size bust of himself, made by Panduro,
the famous Indian sculptor of that city,
whose work has won fame for him among
all who have traveled in Mexico.
A section of ar:illery arrived at Guada
lajara before General iJicz' arrival, and a
national salute was fired in his honor.
More festivities are promised upon the
occasion of his visiting the country seat of
Lionel Carden, H. B. M. Consul-General
at Lake Chapala.

How Sacramento Sports Attempt (â¢ Evade

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 8. â Since
the passage of the city ordinance prohib
iting poolselling in Sacramento, those
members of the sporting fraternity who
found it inconvenient to go the poolrooms
in Yolo County, just beyond the approach
to the river bridge, have been in thÂ« habit
of placing their bets Dy telephone. To
day Chief of Police Drew detailed a num
ber of officers to remain in ihe establish
ments known to be connected by wire
w*ith the poolrooms aud arrest any all
persons detected placing bets by telephone.
The aotion of Chief Drew has raised a
novel legal point, which will probably be

the rates wore reasonable they succeeded
in srettm.: a large number of contracts by
which the merchants agreed to pay sums
varying from $2 50 to $5 on riesentatioa
of the book confining the advertisement
of the firm.
Nothinc more was hoard of the books or
of Harris and Dewev till about the begin
ning of this month, when Dewey called
upon the merchants with the Union
i ltegister and Gazetteer, in which he
snowed the advertisement.
To the surprise and indignation of the
merchants, however, when Dnwey pre
sented the contract and asked ior pay
ment it was found that in every instance
the amount of the contract price had been
raised. Some hart been raised ?10. others
;o $20, $30, $-10 and a few to as high as $Su.
'ihe merchants raised a howl, but
Dewey pointed 10 their signatures on the
contracts and insisted that the amounts
were correct. He demanded prompt fuJ
i lillment of the contract under a threat of
I a civil suit in the courts.
Several of the merchants denounced the
I thins; as a swindle and refused io pay
i more than the original amount they
claimed was in the contract, and a few
werÂ« so angry that Ihty t rew Dewey out
lof .their offices. A good many rather than
have aÂ«y trouble paid the raised ambunts.
Chief Crowiey was notified by somÂ« of
the merchant!?, find Detective Harry Rey
nolds was detuned on tne case. H* suc
ceeded in arresting Dewey ou Satuiday

Since then every eiTo.-t has been made
to find some trace of Harris, and yester
day morning it was ascertained that he
i was in Los Angeles. A dispatch was at
once sent to the Cine: of Police there,
giving a description of Harris and asking
for his arrest on the charge, of forgery in
i raisiiiL' the amounts on the contracts.
D3teci:ve Reyno'ds says that Dewey has
i obtained between $300 and $400 Iron raer

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
TIME TO OFFER
MONEY OR LAND
A Proper Site for the Wil
merding School Is Now
in Demand.
Leading Citizens of San Fran
cisco Are Reminded of Their
Promises.
Regents Defer the Election of Secre
tary of the Board Until Next April.
Candidates in the Field.
Regents C. F. Crocker. E. A. Denicke,
George T. Marye, T. G. Pnelps, A. S. Hal
lidie and President Kelloeg, constituting
a committee recently appointed to select
a director of the Wilmeriiing School, held
a session yesterday forenoon at the Mark
Hopkins Institute. Tbete regents have
learned to their surprise that Mayor-elect
Phelan, J. Richard Freud, Alfred Bouvier
and other leading citizens who were so
active in favoring San Francuco as the
place in whicn the school should be estab
lished hare done nothing toward securing
a site since the regents voted to locate the
institution in this City. Assurance was
previously given by Mr. PheJan that if
money was needed to buy a site he would
raise $25,000. In view of tbe liberal offers
of laud made by Stockton arxi Oakland,
in order to secure the school, the present
indifference of San Francisco capitalists is
remarked by the regents. Should the
board it obliged to use any portion of the
Wilmerding gift of $400,000 to buy land
fur the school in ban Fiancisco there
would be a storm of indignant protests.
The committee which considered the sub
ject yesterday deferred action, so as to
give Mayor-elect Phelan and his associates
time to meet and submit a definite offer of
a site. The hope is expressed also by the
regents that the meeting will take place
at an early day.
A regular Â«e-sion of the board was held
yesterday afternoon, with Regent Phelps
in the chair. The members attending
were Governor Bndd. Judge Slack, Judge
Wallace, J. West Martin, Albert Miller,
C. M. Chase, John E. Budd, H. S. Foote,
S. T. Black, Martin KeliogE, A. S. Halli
die, George T. Marye, E. A. Denicke, C. F.
Crocker and Arthur KoUgers.
In tbe reading of tbe minutes it was in
cidentally noted that Professor E. S.
Holden of the Lick Observatory had been
knighted by the King of Denmark. The
star-gazer is now a Knight of the Order of
Davonborg. The order is indicative of
the casile or strength of Denmark.
Judge Wallace introduced a preamble
and resolution relative to the loss which
the university had sustained in the death
oi the secretary of the board, Key. J. L. C.
Bonte. Tne preamble set forth tnat Mr.
Bon te, in his devotion to the university,
neglected the recreative rest which his ad
vancing years required and the resolution
proposed a continuation of the secretary's
salary for one year, the amount to be paid
to the widow of Dr. Bonte.
The resolution was referred to a com
mittee consisting of Kegents Hallidie,
Martin and Wallace.
President Kel^ogp maae application for
a leave of absence for Proiessor J. N. Le
Conte. The young professor desires to
attend the golden wedding of Professor
Joseph Le Conte in South Carolina, and
also detires that his salary should gor.ght
along during his absence from duty.
The discussion of the proposition to let
Le Conte's salary go on took such a wide
range that Professor Gayiey's leave of ab
sence on pay for a year to work for a Lon
don puohshing tirm was included in the
talk. Judge Wallace brought it under
range by advocating the payment of a
year's saiary to the widow of the late
secretary.
Regent Foote was opposed to all the
propositions to pay for services not per
formed.
It was said by President Kellogg that
Proiessor Gayley would remnd his salary
for a year if ne decided to remain abroad.
Judge Wallace said lie voted against
allowing Gayiey's saiary during the year's
absence because the worK in contempla
tion would be of no substantial benefit to
the university. He brushed aside the
proposition advanced by Mr. Foote, that
the board could not legally pay tLie salary.
Regent Foote was sure that the board
had no legal right to spend money in that
manner. With all deference to Judge
Wallace, whose disposition was to over
ride everybody else, he disagreed on the
proposition of law. He had known Wal
lace to run amuck against the highest con
stituted judicial nuuiority.
Governor Budd, in view of the immi
nent danger ot a great battle between two
distinguished lawyers, moved a reference
of the whole subject to the law committee.
It was referred ult:mately to Major
Mhoon, attorney of the bo&rd.
The Regents went into executive session
to talk about the vacant secretaryship. It
was resolved to defer the election of Mr.
Bonte's successor until next April.
Regents who had been pressed by appli
cants were advised to send all applications
to President Keilogg. The leuaing candi
dates lor the position are:
B, J. Wickson, H. E. Miller, Theodore
Wagner, Joseph L. Scotchler, Oscar L.
Dornin, Rev. H. E. Jewitt, W. C. Bartlett,
John Bonner and W. A. McKeown. Tne
last named is performing the duties of
tbe office at the present time.
John E. Budd made the motion to post
pone the election. The suggestion re
ceived unanimous consent. It is a sure
thing that regents going to the Legisla
ture for appropriations will be held up by
members demanding "recognition" in
filling this office, and the postponement
until after tbe session of the Legislature
may be productive of more harm than
good.
The following committee on legislative
action was appointed yesterday : Regents
Martin, Reinstein, Rodger's, John E.
Budd and Chase.
A bill for work done in the construction
of the Affiliated Colleges building has re
ceived tbe approval of the State Board of
Examinera and now there is plain sailing.
J. West Martin, from the comrniitec un
building and grounds, thought it high
time that ,i superintendent should be ap-
P' inted. One way suggested to get
n o ley to pay the superintendent i.i to
MiiMiituie galvanized iron for terra-cotta.
Other ways may be devised later on.
Mr. Martin did not want a cheap man for
superintendent. Ho fancied that the
salary should ba $250 a month.
Colonel Fred Crocker, who has had ex
perience in constructing three commer
cial buildings, said a first-class man
could be engaged for $150 a month. He
was sure that the regents would ratify
tne decision of the committee. Regents
Rodders. Hallidie, Miller and Denicke
entertained the sama view, and oo the
selection ot a superintendent was left to
the committee on building and grounds.
PREPARING FOR A FIESTA.
Polk Straet Improvers Arranging; Nov
elties lor the Holidays.
The Polk-street Improvement Club has
decided to arrange a midwinter fiesta,
commencing on Dccemb3r 21 and lasting
through the remaining days preceding
Christmas. A committee, composed of
Lewis Heiman, L. H. Konn, 11. Levine,
G. F. Roberts mid F, Curtis, was ap
pointed last night to work upon the
matter.
It was decided that tbe sub-committee
on lights co-operate with the Larkin
ttreet improvers in a petition to ihe Su
pervisors to allow the Mutual Light and
Power Company to extend its poles from
Market street along Larkin and Polk
streets as far as Vallejo. Polk street can
secure the benefit of a reduction of from
$3 to ?1 75 a light every night.
A committee of one from each block
was appointed to take care of the street
and its surroundings from ijutter to Val
lejo street. _

CRESCENT CI TY ROMANCE
Two Loving Hearts United for
the Secoud Time Lat
Night
Both Ceremonies Were P.-rfcrmed
on the Birkentine Sharp
scoter.
When the old British bark Sharpshooter
was towed into San Francisco dismantled
and short of provisions nearly two years
ago no one thought that she would be the
Miss Pearl Kustel and William
Ezra Saville, "Who Were Married
on the High Seas Last July and

man on Board the Barkentine
Sharpshooter Last Night.
theater for a romance. At that time she
looked like a enndidate for the boneyard,
now she flies the Nicaraguan flat; and is
one of the smartest barkentines afloat.
After being thoroughly overhauled and
refitted the Sharpshooter was loaded with
wheat for Australia. She sailed for Mary
torouch last June and it was then the ro
mance began.
Miss Pearl Isabel de Satazar Kustel,
aged 16 years, and William Ezra SavillÂ«,
aged 21 years, both formerly lived in Cres
cent City. Tbe young man is wealthy in
his own right and the young lady was the
belle of tbe town and tbe daughter of Cap
tain Casimer B. Kustel, now of the Sharp
shooter. Tbe parents thought the couple
too young to marry and counseled delay.
The youngsters thought they knew more
than their fathers and mothers and at
tempted to make a runaway match of it.
They were caught and brought back and
to prevent a recurrence of the attempt
Captain Kustel determined to talcs his
daughter to sea with him. When the
Sharpshooter was passing throuch the
Golden Gate he found as a passenger
who had paid his way for the round trip
young Saville.
A month later the gallant master of the
ship found that the lovers were deter
mined to be married as soon as the bark
entine reached Australia, and that iur
thermore young Saville was made of
sterner Btuff than he thought, so one night
a marriage at sea was decided upon.
Tne Sharpshooter arrived last Sunday,
and the following entry from the cap
tain's log tells its own story:
Marriedâ On honrd Nioarflguan bsrk Sharp
shooter, latitude 9 deg. 35 in in. south, longi
tude 100 deg. 20 mm. west, July 12, 189G, tÂ»y
Captain C. B. Kustel, Wlliiam E. Saville and
Pearl Isabel de Snlazar Kusiel. second daugh
ter of Captain and Mrs. C. B. Kuotel.
The romance did not end Ihere, how
ever. The young couple had a most en
joyable trip to the Antipodes, and started
for home lull of the idea oi giving their
friends in Crescent City and elsewhere a
genuine surprise. The father was not
counting on surprises, however, and jrhiie
sati?fied that nothing could be more oind
inc than the marriage on the high seas,
still he wanted the ceremony performed
again when the vessel was in dock. Last
night a qufet little company assembled in
the cabin of the Sharpshooter, and there,
in the presence of all her relatives, Mr?.
Savilte was again married to her hus
band. Conrraiulations followed, and the
compnny spent an enjoyable hour. Mr.
and Mrs. Saville will leave on tne next
steamer for Crescent City, where they will
make their home. \
Tne bride is a very handsome little
woman with black hair and dark eyes.
She looks older than her age, wnile ncr
husband looks younger than his 21 years.
He is a blonde, and either his whukers
nave not yet begun to grow or else he
shaves clean. He and his father-in-law
secured the marriage license yesterday,
and Mrs. Kustel was down from Crescent
Ciiy to witness the ceremony.

ESCAPED FROM
NAPA ASYLUM
Frank R. Laumeister at
Liberty for Nearly
Three Years.
Has Been Working in the
Mines and Peddling Since
Then.
His Arrast for Drunkenness Led tc
His Identification and R'arrest
Yesterday.
Frank R. Laumeister, a peddler and
cousin of ex-Sheriff Laumeister, is in a
padded cell in the Receiving Hospital, and
(his mornins he will be taken back to the
asylum at Nana.
Liumeister was committed to the asy
lum in March, 1888. Since then he has
made his escape three times. The last oc
casion was in May, 1891, and it was by the
merest accident that be was recaptured
for the third time.
For the past eighteen months he has
been living on the Ss<n Bruno road under
the name of Frank Miller. He carried on
the trade of a peddler, and had a horse
and wagon which he drove around the
country with his wares.
On Monday night he was attacked by
six young hoodlums on the Sui Bruno
road, and was wounded on the scalp. He
defended himself with an iron bar, and
succeeded in driving them off. The en
counter upset him, and he drank some
liquor to steady his nerves. He came into
the City and met Policeman D. Brown on
Valencia street, who arrested him for
beiug drunk. When asked his name ai the
nation he repli d
Frank Laumeister, forgetting that he was
known 113 Frank. Miller.
He was discharged in the Police Court
yesterday morning, but soon afterward
the name was recognized and the police
noiilied the Sheriff that he was probably
tbe man who escaped from the N;tpa Asy
lum. Under Sheriff Clack and a deputy
went out to the San Bruno road and ar
rested him. He admitted his identity and
was taken to the Receiving Hospital. The
Napa Asylum authorities were notified
and a reply was received that an officer
would arrive this morning to take him
back.
Laumeister tells an interesting story of
how he managed to escape from the asy
lum and his experiences since that time.
"I made up my mind to escape again,"
he said, '"aivd prepared tor the event. I
told the gardener that I would get away, !
but he laughed at me. I made two keys,
one out of my comb and the other out of a
spoon.
"I waited till a night when there was a i
ball at the asylum. I dressed myself and!
covered myself up in bed so that when the .
watchman made his rounds he thought 1 I
was undressed and asleep. As soon as he j
left I opened the door ol my cell with one ;
of the keys I hud made, and before I got j
outside I had to open three other doors. '
No one noticed mn and I got clear away.
"I went to Sacramento and then to the
mines in Am.idor County, where I worked
for some months under the name of Frank <
Miller. Then I went to Colusa and j
worked there for a few weeks till i broke j
uiy arm. After my arm was better I j
thought I would go back to San Francis- j
co, where no on 6 would recognize me, as
my appearance was a good deal altered
and I called myself Frank Miller.
"When I got here I bought a horse and j
wngon and went into the peddling busi- :
lie*?. 1 made money Â»t it and was getting j
along all right, as nobody teemed to rec- j
osnize me as Frank Laumeister.
"La-t night the hoodlums attacked me, I j
think to rob me, and I foolishly gave my i
name hs Frank Lnuineister at the police |
station. Now they have me here and I
suppose will send me back to Napa. lam j
not crazy and if Dr. Williams had been |
alive I would not have been taKAn back."

Jn People vs. Phillips, 70 Cat. 68, the trial
court detailed \o the jury certain facts of the
caÂ«e as hsvinc been proven, and this court
there said: 'Of course, this method oi charg
ing a jury should be careiully avoided, but it
his bven held here that an instruction assum
ing a fact does not demand a reversal, if the
j fact is i dmit:e<l or there is no shadow oi con
flict of evidence with re.-peet to it."
In the present case it there was any bone-

demand a new trial of the case, but we ti
nniim; the record in vain for any such claim
by counsel, and look in vain in mat record for j
i a'word of evid^uce tending io show that the j
killing was done in self-Jetense. The de
tendant herself testified: "I have no recol
lection of having tired a shot at him."
Defendant's counsel rested the case upon
tiio theory that if the defendant killed the de
ceased slie was insane at the time and not
legally resp >nsibe ior the act. That she aid
kill the ik ceased musi be taken as a couceded
lact, and upon such concussion appellant is
tnen left to justity upon the sole plea of non
aeconiuabiliiy. 01 course evidence at the
trial effered by a defendant may take a wider |
rauge than his opening statement, and may i
establish defenses not there adverted to. Yet !
! here such is not the fact.
The mo*t injurious construction to defen
dant which could be given the chnrge is that
in effect the jury was told by it that the ques
tion of self-defense was not in the case. The
record dscloses thai fact without contradic
tion and ns a mutter of law, and there is noiii- >
iiig in the givinproi this instruction to demand j
a new trial. There are many trials upon :
charges oi murder where self-defense is not i
an element, and no harm could possibly re- '
suit to the defendant in sucn a case if the .
jury was so instructed by the Judge.
Other exceptions were reviewed ana the
court found that the trial court committed
no error in refusing to Rive the various '
instructions asked by defendant's counsel.

IHIi CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Sse the horse show and live.
The Cuban crisis comes our way.
Nearly every critic said, "The message
is commonplace."
It goes without saying that the horse
show will be a dress parade.
Grover says the deficit need not disturb
us, but all the same it does.
We can brag on our horses and women,
as well as on fruits and flowers.
The Examiner is showing symptoms of
getting Sharkey for a sporting editor.
The fundine bill fitrht is right on us, and
we may look for the rush to begin any day.
Decaden* journalism reaches total
degradation when it begins to publish its
own record.
The Presidential message is so wer.k in
proportion to its size that it can hardly
support its own weight.
Congress will please take notice that a
good way to raise the revenue would be to
raise the duty on sugar.
If you did not read the President's mes
sage yesterday you need not read it at all.
It is a back number now.
It is said tne Washington public has
lo?t all interest in this Congress, but there
is a bigzer public watching it.
San Diego is marching to no boom this
time, but all the same she is on rising
ground and moving uphill steadily.
Cleveland says the time for interference
in Cuba may come, and Olney says it is
near at hand. Now what will Congress
say?
The Bryan Democrats smiled when they
met Senator Palmer at the Capitol, but
every smile there was the cold gleam of a
frosty morning.
It is worth while repeating every day
that in all preparations for holiday joys
there should be some remembrance of the
claims of charity.
The silver Republicans in Congress show
sign*- of continuing the fight against the
party on the money question, but they
wiil stand with it for protection.
Cleveland may have learned nothing,
bnt his message shows that'he has forgot
ten something. For example, he has
forgotten that he once denounced the
Gorman tariff as a measure of "perfidy
and dishonor."
The Chronicle asks, "Wouldn't it be a
good thing if Congress could limit the
length of the President's message?" It
certainly would, and it would also be a
good thing if Congress could limit the
length of its own talk.
. One of the satisfactory features of the
time is the active crusade now being made
against depraved journalism. It is being
waged all over the country, from tne At
lantic to the Pacific, and is everywhere
finding the support of all right-thinking
people.
If any movement is made by Congress
toward revenue reform this winter it must
be made on protective lines and must do
justice to all industries. Tbe Dingley bill
will not suit the country in any respect
and if it cannot be amended it had better
be abandoned.
There i 3 truth in the saying of Rev.
William F. Faunce of New Yorkâ "lf
askÂ»d what it is right to print 'wo cannot
always answer; but we all know the dif
ference between an enterprise fighting for
purity and truth and one seeking to
pollute the people."
The election of McKmley brought about
a sharp advance in industry, which soon
gave way to a temporary reaction, but
that in turn bas j assed away and we are
now enterirg upon a period which prom
ises a steady forward movement toward
permanent prosperity.
Public sentiment in Hew York has been
roused to indignation against the de
pravities of vicious journalism as exhib
ited by Mr. Hearst's newspaper in that
city, and it is time an equal indignation
should assert itself against the vileness of
his paper in San Francisco.
A physician of Paris claims that em
ployes of gas works are exceptionally
heaitny, and advances the tneory that
breathing the almost here of any place
where coal tar is largely u-ed is a preven
tion against not only epidemic diseases.
but nearly all forma of sickness.
The reported shipment of green oranges
from the southern part of the State has
rightly excited the growers to investigate
the story and to take steps to prevent such
shipments in future. A few carloads of
green oranges in the East could materi
ally injure the reputation of Calilornia fruit
ia that section and cause a decline in the
demand that would email a heavy iosson
the ripening crop.
The current number of the Merchants'
Association Review is an exceptionally
strong one and should be read by all mer
chants and property-owners in the City.
It deals with live topics, of local import
ance and urges the cause of municipal im
provement and development with a force
ana vigor which will go far toward carry
ing them to success.
A CRUSADE FOR DECENCY.
One of the most cheering signs of the time is the vigorous crusade now being
waged in all parts of the United States against those flashy, vicious and depraved
newspapers which, taking advantage of the liberty guaranteed to the press under
our laws, have degraded the profession of journalism by every form of pollution
which a prurient imagination can devise.
The crusade had its origin in New York, and was directly caused by the foul
excesses of the Journal of that city, a paper owned by Mr. Hearst, which rivals in
sensational vulgarities Mr. Hearst's other paper, the Examiner of San Francisco.
New York can endure and has endured much, but it has revolted against this
form of iniquity, which unites innate viciousness with a public abandonment of
shame.
The press and the pulpit of New York have united to make war for decency,
morality and good taste against the foul influence which emanates from Hearst's
publications. The vigor of the appeals uttered there has awakened a response
across the continent. At this time there is not a reputable newspaper or decent
weekly periodical in the cities of New York and San Francisco which is not en
listed in a crusade against the conductor of such depraved journals and against pub
lic tolerance of such newspapers as the New York Journal and the San Francisco
Examiner ia their present indecent and offensive course.
It will be readily understood that legitimate journals hesitate to enter upon the
task of exposing this foul excrescence which has fastened upon their profession.
It would be pleasanter to ignore it and let the foul thing run its loathsome course to
the slums and die of its own corruption or find a speedier ending at the hands of
the police. This, however, it is not saft to do. Public morality must be guarded
and public decency protected. The press as well as the pulpit must speak out.
Decadent journalism must be condemned and the public warned of its evils by
every means which virtue and morality have at their disposal.
The reasons which have impelled the leading journals and the most eminent
pastors in New York to begin an earnest crusade auainst tbe vileness disseminated
by the depraved sheets of thai city are sufficient to justify The Call in promoting
the crusade in this City. The evil here is even greater than anything of which New
York knows. Mr. Hearst has not yet left his paper in New York to the manage
ment of an irresponsible man whose repute is shown by his suggestive nickname
of "Long Green," and whose career has been such that he requires the pistol pro
tection of a hired bully. Vile as have been the offenses by which Mr. Hearst has
stirred the indignation of New York they have been as nothing in comparison
with those which have insulted San Francisco and shocked the sense of morals
and decency among its people.
The course of the Examiner, under the editorial management of "Long Green"
Lawrence, made bold by the favor ol Hearst and rendered impudent by tne pro
tection of Earp, has gone from bad to worse with a Btartling rapidity. It inlects
with vileness everything it touches and casts suspicion upon all with which it is
associated. It is time for San Fraucisco to act upon the indignation it has so long
and justly felt The foul, lying, prurient sheet which encourages frauds and fakes
and indecencies in everything, from politics to sports, should be repudiated by all
decent people and left to perish in the slums from which emanate its ideas and
inspiration. â¢
THE HORSE SHOW.
The two beautiesâ fair women and fine
horses â will constitute the show which
will entertain the people of San Francisco
at the Pavilion for the remainder of the
week. It will be the best display of the
kind yet seen upon the Pacific Coast, and
it is not bragging too much to say that so
far as the women are concerned it will be
tbe best ever seen in any part of the
world.
The show will serve the double purpose
of providing society with a grand gather
ing place lor recreation and enjoyment
and advancing the welfare of one of the
greatest industries in the State. Nowhere
does the horse attain greater perfection
then in California, and in no country of
anything like equal population has there
been so much wealth and skill devoted to
his breeding and maintenance. The pres
tige of Kentucky as the great horse State
in the Union will soon belong to California,
even if it is not rightly hers already, and
with the honor will come larger profits for
those engaged in the breeding of good
horses.
In the very nature of things a com
munity has to depend upon men of wealth
to advance the breed oi its horses. Tne
industry requires a large expenditure of
money and in many instances is not
directly profitable to those who engage in
it. It is decidedly profitable, however, to
the community at large. From the fine
breeding stables of millionaires strains of
good blood go forth and are gradually in
fused through all the horses of the State,
so that the plow horse of the farmer and
the dray horse of the city are improved by
the remote intermingling with the trotters
and thoroughbreds of the stock farms.
In the show at the Pavilion, the chief in
terest for the great majority of people will
be the social function. This is so in every
city where such displays are held. Tbe
horse is an indispensable adjunct to so
ciety and fashion. He adds niuc i to the
pomp and pleasure of men and women,
and they value him for it. The annual
display of fine horses serves to encourage
nublic taste and delight in the possession
of good teams and also affords a means of
making known what is the best in horse
flesh, and therefore society receives in
struction as well as entertainment from
tbe social function which the show affords
tneru.
It is noted that popular as well as social
interest in these displays increases with
each succeediner year. The entertainment
of this week will be the best we nave had
so far, but it is a safe prediction that it
will be exceeded when the next one is
hell. This growing interest will manifest
itself not only in the display on the frack,
but in tbe even more fascinating display
in the boxes and among the seats oi the
spectators.
The arrangements which have been
made for the accommodation of the pa
trons of the display are much better than
in former years a^d this will a d to the
enjoyment of all who attend it. It is safe
to say that the throngs of visitors will
be sufficient to make the display profitable
to the enterprising and nublic-spirited
men who have promoted it. Few people
in the City will be willing to miss it
altogether. Everybody will desire to see
the two beauties.
THE CITY CREDITORS.
The resolutions passed to print by the
Board of Supervisors on Monday evening
requesting the Legislature at its next ses
sion to take such action as may be in ac
cordance with just.cc and fair dealing to
secure and ensure tiie payment of all
outstanding demands honestly incurred
and rightfully due to the merchants
of the City and County will have the
support of the people generally. It
is not questioned that San Fran
cisco justly owes considerable sums of
money, and it should be equally unques
tioned that it is the duty of the City to
pay them as promptly as possible.
There has been already much longer de
lay in th s matter than mere should have
be>>n. It is certainly un.ortunate that the
condition of our Jaw is such that Ban
Francisco cannot pay a just debt, even
when she is willing to pay it. Laws o:
that kind are decidedly opposed to public
policy, as well as to tbe good credit of the
munici) ality, and the Legislature should
promptly substitute better laws in their
place.
The claims against the City which led
to tbe offer of thb resolution t>re too well
known to require a restatement. They
have been set forth both in the press and
in the courts, and the justice of the claim
ants have been well established before
both tribunal*. Nothing stands in tne
way of the payment of those claims hut a
1< gal technicality. The people desire to
see the claims settled, and this reproach
against the good name of the City re
moved. It is certainly an absurdity that
we should have a municipal government
authorized to squander money foolishly,
but having no authority in law to pay its
honest debts.
California expects her Congressmen to
be active and aggressive in fighting the
funding bill and earnest and prompt in
everything that tends to promote the
welfare of the State.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
THE FUNDING BILL.
No portion of the President's message is
more important to the people of California
than that which relates to the Pacific
roads debts. On this issue the President
speaks clearly. After giving a full state
ment of the indebtedness of the roads,
their default in obligations to the Govern
ment and the probability of further de
fault occurring on January 1, 1897, be says :
Therefore, unless Congress shall otherwise
direct, or shall have previously determined
upon a different solution of the problem, there
will hardly appear to exist any reason for de
laying beyond the date of default above men
tioned such executive action as will promise
to subserve the public Interests and save the
Government from the loss threatened by
further inaction.
The effect of this declaration on the part
of the President will be to brin? the fund
ing bill immediately to the front. It can
hardly be doubted that some effort will be
made by the frienus of the railroad in
Congress to provide a means by which the
road will be saved from the action of fore
closure on the part of the Government,
which is expressly announced as immi
nent.
Mr. Cleveland declares the act of Con
gress passed March 3, 1887, which charges
the President with the duty of foreclosing
Government liens in case of default, has
not been enforced by him because of the
fact that Congress has for a number of
years almost constantly had under consid
eration various plans for dealing with the
conditions existing between these roads
and the Government. This excuse for non
interference he does not believe will jus
tify him in delayine action after the first
day of next year, and accordingly, if the
Pacific roads hope to escape foreclosure
they must act vigorously and at once.
The final contest in this long struggle is
therefore precipitated upon us. We may
be sure the friends of the railroad in Con
gress will exert all their energies and
make uÂ»e of every means to prevent the
threatened foreclosure. It behooves the
people of California, tueir representatives
and their friends in Congress to be vigilant
and active in guarding against all that the
railroad may attempt. The voice of Cali
fornia should make itself heard by its
delegation in Congress and by the press.
The time for action has come and it should
be of the most determined and resolute
sort.
The prospects of complete victory are
good. The present session of Congress
will be short and it has much important
legislation to attend to. It seems fairly
probable therefore that it will be poss:ble
for the advocates of justice to defeat any
attempt which the monopoly may make.
Even if a funding bill should pass the
House it is not likely to pass the Senate,
and if Mr. Cleveland remains true to the
policy outlined in his message we may ex
pect to see some steps soon taken to pro
tect the interests of tbe Government and
the wellare of the people from the grasp
ing greed of tne monopolists.
THE CUBAN CRISIS.
The passage of Mr. Cleveland's influence
in home politics is strikingly shown by
the fact that comparatively little atten
tion has been given to what he said about
the tar.ff or the currency. The portion of
his message which has been subject to
the- most comment is that referring to
Cuba and the possibility that the United
Stute> may soon ue called upon to inter
fere for tbe purpose of putting .an end to
the war in that island.
On this subject, however, the message
of the President is hardly so notable
as that of his Secretary of State, Mr.
Olney. The President goes no further
than to siiy a time may arrive when a
correct policy and care for our interests as
well as a regard for the interests of other
nations will constiain our Government to
such action as will subserve tbe interests
thus involved and restore to Cuba the
blessings of peace. Mr. Olney is more de
cided in his tihn. He speaks of the time
.or such interference as being near at
hand, and says:
From whatever point of view we regard the
matter it is impossible not to discern that a
state of things exist> at our door alike danger
ous to good relations, destructive oi legiti
mate commerce, fatal to the internal re
sources of Cuba and most vexatious and
trying because entailing upon this Gov
ernment excessive burdens in its domestic
administration and Its outward relations.
This situation cannot indefinitely continue
without growing still worse, and the time
may not be iar distent when the United States
must seriously consider whether its rights and
inters s, as well as its international duties, in
view of its peculiar relations to the island, do
not call tot some decided change In the policy
hitherto pursued.
Statements like these from men who
are intrusted with the management of our
foreign nffaira and who speak under the
responsibility of involving this country in
war will certainly have the Â« ffect of con
lirminc even the most wavering citizens
in tbe belief that the condition of the af
fairs of Cuba is fully as bad if not worse
than has been depicted by newspaper cor
respondent-. The question, therefore, is
brought straight to the eopie whether
they are prepared to support the Govern
ment in actively intervenng between
Spain and Cuba, even at the risk of war.
It will need no jingo spirit to arouse the
American people to favor decided action
on the issue. The report of Secretary Ol
ney snows so clearly the evils that are
wrought not only upon the Cubans but
upon Americans living in t; at country or
trading with it that he seems fully justi
hed in his assertion that some decided
change is necessary in the policy which
has hitherto been pursued.
Wnatever course our Government takes
in the matter, either this winter or under
the incoming administration, will un
doubtedly nave the support not only of
our own people, but of thtÂ» civilized world.
Spain has no just cause of complaint
against us. We have done everything
which we could to support her govern
ment of the island so long as such a gov
ernment seemed possible. We have pre
vented any filibustering from this coast in
aid of the Cubans, and have rigidly main
tained all the obligations imposed upon
us by international law, and if now we
find it necessary for the protection of our
own people to exert the strong arm of our
Government we will certainly be blame
less of injustice, aggression or any form
of wrongdoing.

THE NEW JOURNALISM.
"Save the babies! save the babies!"
Such is the continuous cry during the summer months of a New York evening
sheet devoted to the cult of the "new journalism." The children of tne tenements
are overcome by the heat, the bad odors and the tainted aimosDi ere of the great
metropolis and thÂ» proprietor of the sheet in question endeavors to add to his circula
tion by encouraging the patronage of collection-boxes and the erection of promi-cn
ous candy and fruit stanag, the proceeds of which are supposed to accrue to the suffer
ers' benefit. In other words, he manages to "keep things humming" all summer
long for "sweet charity's sake"â and his own!
So far, so good. There is no objection to the children benefiting from this form of
"benevolence." Yet in truth th. y stand in need of salvation from far greater danzers
than the mere jhysical discomforts above nlluded to. Every hoar of the day and
every day of the year they suffer from the pollution of tne lewd, sensational, vn gar
press, whose whole tendency for years has been to de rade public taste and morals by
a systematic panderine to the lowest instincts of humanity. It io tlorified vice and
crime, and has in^tiLed in tbe hearts of the young Â» disregard for the prompting s oi
virtue and the higher ideals of our civilization. The repellant figure of the spirit of
evil is, in fact, daily walking through our centers of population, our congested dis
tricts, like the blact pest ol the Middle Ages, scattering the seed of moral death and
destruction on all sides.
Yes, indeed, "Save the babies, save tae babies!" The adults can take care of
themselves; it is not they who suffer from contact with the virus. It is the childrenâ
the children of the poor above allâ from the tender age when the meaning of a phrase,
tne significance of a picture, first dawns upon their youthful intellects until the
threshold of maturity has been reached. The struggle for existence raging around in
all its fury deprives them of a parent's watchful mentorship. They are left to face
the danger alone and unprotected. It is they â the children of the poor â who suc
cumb to the blighting influence of the "new journalism," and swell the lists of our
criminals and law-breasers. It is ihey whose bodies the arch-fiend is willing to save,
so that he may ail the more surely destroy their souls.
The "new journalism" is an exotic plant in this fair land of the United States.
It is a product of the ghetto, distinctively Oriental in its lubricity, its lasciviousnes>-,
its flashinesÃ. Transported in the steerage with other vermin from an obscure and
obnoxious quarter of Europe, it first developed, flourished, and grew fat in a great
Western city, and then eariy in the eighties, was transplanted to New York to burst
forth in all its hideousness. We had troubles enough in those duys, it must be ad
mitted, but our press at least was free from the taint of prurient sensationalism; our
children ran no risk of defilement from an accumulation of literary and pictorial filth
on every newspaper stand. One could obtain comprehen-ive information regarding
current events without the additional bawdy or cbarnel house flavoring. In those
days, moreover, t. c professional circulation affidavit liar was a thing unknown, and
the chromo, the guessing-match, the puzzle competition did not figure as leading
factors in the dissemination of thought.
All these ennobling features and many othersâ unfit for publicationâ we owe to
the great arch-hend of the "new journalism." Unfortunately he has not been allowed
to pursue his path of villainy without experiencing that slncerest form of flattery
known as imitation. The imitator, indeed, has at times outdone the original, and he
certainly has succeeded in outstripping the latter in the race for circulation. The
Rev. William H. Faunce of New York has graphically summed up the situation thus
created. Says he:
There are two newspapers in this city whoÃe very names are synonyms of degradation;
whose very posters reek with moral poisou; which exist by the systematic and purposed cor
ruption of their readers. They have become purveyors of lust and brutality, and diurnal in
stigators of crime. Every father dreads to see them in the hands of his son, and every pure
mother snatches them from her daughter's hand. They parade our streets simply for evil pur
poses, fattening on the weakness oi human nature mid resembling nothing so much us a gar
bage-cart dragged through the streets dripping with the unspeakable. Yet they ask admission
to our homes. If asked what is right to print, we cannot always answer. But we all know the
difference between an enterprise fighting for purity and truth and one seeking to pollute the
people.
The questions now arise: What are we eoine to do about it? Will it become
necessary in the end to enact special legislation for tbo suppression of the vicious
press? Must we have a public censor, the same as in the majority of European
countries? Or are our children and our children's children destined, under the arch
fiend's mentorship, to follow the path carved out for us by his two European co
religionists, Nordau and Lombroso â the path of Aryan degeneration?
The New York Sun and the Evening Post are doing noble work in arousing their
readers to an appreciation of the dangers involved in the spread of the "new jour
nalism," but they have as yet suggested no practical remedy for the growing evil.
Says the Sun: "But the corrective must be administered by decent public sentiment.
That is the only effectual remedy." This is well enough as far as it goes, but in order
to be effectual the opposition to the inroads of the new journalism must assume some
practical form. It must not be confined to the columns of the decent press. Pubic
sentiment of itself will accomplish little without methodic action. Let the clergy, the
school-teachers, the parents and guardians ot the yourjg, let all who exercise control
over the youthful minds, band togetner in one^olid organization, regardless of race or
creed, and proceed to down the monster systematically. Let the Christian Endeavor
ers, the Salvation Army, the Young Men's Christian Association, an.i all the other
religious and social organizations, unite on this common ground and combat the soul,
killing pest. Only by combined action can any lasting result be obtained. We are
asked to subscribe to pledges against indulgence in alcohol and tobacco. Why not
introduce a pledge of total abstinence from the use of the 'Morning Hog- Wash" or
the "Evening Swill-Barrel"? V. Geibayedoff.

A USEFUL HOUSE GOWN.
A flannel of black and sage green stripes,
with trimmings of black satin ribbon, forms
this charming and comfortable house grown,
which is fitted to the figure by one dart on
either side of the front, and has usual back
forms, which form godet effects below the
waist. The sleeve is of the leg-o'-mutton shape.
Alight blue crepon had the lace set on to
outline a square yoke, and falling over the
sleeves. An inch border of brown lur finished
the edge of the ruffle. The front of the gown
was hooked invisibly, and a bow of white
ribbon with long ends finished the front.
The neck had a collar of white satin with
tiny points of blue, edged with fur set on
either side of the front.
A plain untrlramed wrappgr of pink flannel
is most serviceable, as it may easily be laun
dered. A collHrette of white nainsook with
narrow Valenciennes lacecttn be made detach
able with turn up cuffs to mutch.
Or a pointed lace collar maybe made into
an elaborate accessory by sewing a ruffle of
bright itriped ribbon, around it, making it
into a point at each point of tbe lace collar,
and tacking it there. A whit- flarinel gowu
with white lace collar and blue and white
striped ribbon was very dainty.
This model is very useful for wrapper* of
wash fabrics, and is at the same time appro
priate for making up handsome tea gowns of
any fabric, the trimmlnir changing the char
acter of the garment entirely.

LONG GREEN'S BODYGUARD
SWEARS HE IS A POOR MM
Earp Has Lived in San Francisco Five Years and
Does Not Know Where Sansome Street Is
Situated.

Went to Va'lejo With Lynch,
His Manager.
TWO DETECTIVES AT WORK.
It Is Reported They H v? Discover?
Enough to Send Sorm Peop.e
lo the Penitentiary.
The decision of Referee Earp, friend and
companion of "Long Green" Lawrence,
managing editor of the Examiner, is still
the all-absorbing topic of conversation in
sporting circles.
At present the skirmish line is in the
All Gasses of Craft Arc Represented in the Oakland Estuary. Whalers, Steamers, British Ships and Coasters Make Up a Motley

courts, the stake-money is locked up by
an injunction, and it looks now as though
there will be but very little left of the
$10,000 for Sharkey aiter Danny Need ham,
D J. Lynch, the lawyers, court judg
ments And training vxpenses are paid.
Sharkey was taken from his bed yester
day afternoon and went to Valle}o
with his manager, Lynch. Just what this
new movement indicates has not yet come
to light, but it is suspected that they have
received legal advice to the effect that it
will be better for them to get out of the
jurisdiction of the courts, in view of the
present very active litigation on the sub
ject of debts.
Earp appeared in Justice Groezinger's
court yesterday afternoon and testified
that he was poor and owned only the
clothes on his back. Although having re
sided here tor several years he swore that
ne did not know where Sansome street
was. It was the opinion of many of the
spectators that Long Green should take a
day off and make Mr. Earp acquainted
with the business part of the City.
The investigation into the alleged qon
Â»piracy to rob the betting public is being
proceeded with very quietly. Detectives
have been working on the case, and it
is reported that the evidence they have
secured is overwhelming.
When Justice of the Peace Groezinger
called the case of J. F. Carroll vs. Robert
FitzsimmonK the courtroom was crowded
with spectators. Wyatt Earp, who failed
to appear at the former session of the
court, was present and was the center of
observation by the curious crowd.
Attorney Arthur E. Mack was in attend
ance to look after Sharkey's interests,
vrhiie George Perry and Jacob Raver rep
resented the plaintiff. Mr. Raver sat by
Mr. Perry's side and suggested questions
to him from time to time. Mr. Perry an
nounced at the outset t at he did not
wish to push the contempt matter against
"Long Green's" friend.
Earp was called to the stand, and in
answer to a question by Justice Groezin
ger explained why he had failed to obey
i he subpena. He said the paper was
handed to him by a deputy sheriff with
whom he was not acquainted, and that
having a nandful of correspondence at
the time, he placed the subpena in his
coat- pocket and forgot all about It. The
witness was deferential to the court.
"There is no reason why I should dis
obey your orders in any way. 1 have
been an officer lor thirty years of my life,
and for that reason 1 know what it means
io disobey the court."
The court purged Earp of contempt and
Mr. Perry proceeded to inquire abutb ut the
certificate of deposit for ihe $10,000 stake
;noney. The witness said that he haJ the
certificate in his hands at the time he
acted as referee and when the garnish
ment was served on him. He told about
Lynch going out to his house on Golden
Gale avenue and how they went down
town to some bank, wi ere Enrp indorsed
the certificate. He could not tell the
name of me bank nor the street on wh.cti
it was located, beyond the fact that it was
Hbout a block and a half from the Nevada
Bank on Montgomery street and in the
direction of the bay.
He denied tuat he had bad any under
standing with any person or persons as to
the disposition of the purse or the certifi
cate oÂ» deposit.
"Do you own any property?" asked Mr.
Perry.
Mr. Raver looked interested.
"Nothing, except the clothes on my
back," replied Earp.
He added that he had some race horses,
but they were leased by him for three
years from a woman who lives in Santa
Rosa.
Mr. Perry tried to find out from the wit
ness the location of the bank, bat Earp,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
although he said that he had resided in
t .is City lor several years, swore that he
aid not know where Sansome street was.
The case was then continued until this
afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The suspense in this whole scandal will
be relieved In the morning. Long Green
Lawrence, Danny Lynch, Wyatt Earp and
Thomas Sharkey, as well as the lesser
stars in the "foul constellation" will be
given a chance to prove that they did not
conspire tn defraud Robert Fitzsimmons
out of $10,000 and the public out of tne
wagers made on the Sharkey fight.
Colonel H I. Kowalsky, the legal repre
sentative of Fhzsircmons, brought suit
yesterday directly aeainst Sharkey to re
cover $10,000, which the defendant is al
leged to be withholding from the rightful
owner.
"This action," explained Colonel Kow
alsky, "can settle the whole controversy in
short order. If Sharkey, Earp, Lynch
and that clique are in the right they can
get in and prove it. If they are in the
wrong they will bring up some techni
cality and, en use delay.
"We will appear before Judge Sanderson
ami produce our witnesses. We will show
that there was a conspiracy, by which Mr.
Fitz-inimons was robbed of $10,000 and
the evidence we have in our possession is
overwhelming.
"The reason we desire to put our case
before the court so soon is that witnesses
in affairs of this kind are of a migratory
class. They are here to-day and tneir
business culls them away to-morrow.
While they are hore we want to hear their
testimony instead of having to delay mat
ters by having to send out of the State for
their depositions. If the Lynch-Sharkey
side wishes to act in gocd faith and hopes
o present a clear case it can produce its
evidence either this morning or to-mor
row. There is no reason for delay in the
matter. Either Fitzsimmons is right and
Sharkey wrong, or vice versa."
EDITOR BUNKER'S LETTER.
He Contradicts a Statement,. Made,
by Gibbs and Groom.
Apropos of Referee Earp and his alleged
-election by the National Club, on Monday
last a statement from J. J. Groom and J.
D. Gibbs appeared in The Call, of which
the following is a part:
The managers of the principals were arguing
for several days over the appointment of a
referee, and it became manifest as the.day of
the contest approached that '.bey would make
no selection, that they could not agree upon
any one, and Mr. Gibbs and I talked over the
matter, as it was importunt that we should
be prepared at 12 o'clock, noon, of December
2 to name the referee in the event that the
managers of the principals failed to do so. In
discussing the matter Mr. Giobs stated that he
had tn mind a man who would give entire
satisfaction, as he whs reported to be fearless,
cool and honest. He said that such men as
Andy Lawrence of the Examiner, Mr. Bunker
of :he Report and Mr. Simpson of the Chronicle
spoke in terms of praiso of him, and we could
make no mistake in selecting him. I said:
"If he is good enough for the press he is eood
good enough for me."
As will be seen by the letter fiom Mr.
Bunker, which is self-explanatory, he did
not speak in terms of praise of Referee
Earp, but on the contrary he advised the
club through the Report to avoid the re
sponsibility of selecting a referee. This is
what Mr Bunker writes:
Charles M. Shortridge, EdttorCallâT>EAVi Sib:
At 4 p. m. on tne day preceding the Snirki-y-
Fiizsimmous content our sporting editor tele
phoned tn me mat Mr. Gibbs would call at the
Report office between 4 and half-past ana leave
tickets of admission for tne paper. At 5 o'CIo k
Mr. Gibbs called, showed me the diagram, al
lowed me lo select seats and gave me the tick
ets. Incidentally I naked him if any referee
had been selected. He answered in the nega
tive, and added that in case the principals
tailed to unit" on a man the club had some
one who would surely suit everybody. I asked
him who mis some one was and he told me it
was Wyatt Earp, adding that Mr. Earp had
been indorsed by people in good standing, in
cluding several newspaper men. He asked me
what I thought of the choice and 1 said I knew
notnlng of Earp beyond the fnct tnat he had
won a frontier reputation for courage. I iur
tfaer remarked that the Reoon had iilready
advised the club to avoid the responsibility of
selecting a reieree.andl thought the advice
was timely and pertinent. This was the on. y
talk I had with anybody about the affair, and
I should not have had this ink had not Mr.
Gibbs called at the office to leave tickets and
this talk was merely a casual chat while the
selection of tickets was being made. Very
truly yours, W. M. Bunker,
President Daily Report Publishing Company.
WYATT EARP SUED.
O.d Tombstone L>tbts Bob Up Like
Graveyard Ghosts.
Attorney Joseph Rothschild yesterday
filed a suit for J. H. Lavenson against
Wyatt Earp, Marshall Williams and John
H. Jackson to collect money due on two
notes made in Tombstone, Ariz., over hf
teen years ago.
Both notes are dated October 29, 1881, the
first being for $600 and the other for
$510 79.
Indorsements on the papers show that
they were presented for payment at ma
turity and that in the usual legal way
they went to protest, the Examiner's noted
gun-fighter and favorite priza-fight referee
not thinking it necessary to provide means
to protect the inte nty of his paper.
In the many years that have passed
those notes have been pursuing Earp, but
he has dodged thera^ so successfully that
nobody has been abie to collect anything
on them. The usual methods of collection
will be followed, and if Ea*p gets the sal
ary that be ought to have for serving as the
bodyguard of An ly Lawrence, the Long
Green editor of Willie Hearst's Examiner,
the long-suffering creditors of the discred
ited referee may at last be consoled by eet
tinc a glimpse of the color of his money.
Earp will be called up in court on an
order of examination aa to his property
and his salary, when some interesting
revelations may be expected.
EARP AND HIS WEAPON.
He Pleads Not Guilty In Judge
Low's Court.
Judge Low's court was crowded yester
day morning, the attraction being Wyatt
Earp, who appeared to answer the charge
of carrying a concealed weapon. He was
accompanied by his attorney, Frank
Kelly.
When his name was called Earp rose
and pleaded not guilty to the charge.
His attorney said he would waive a jury,
but asked for a continuance till to-morrow
morning, which was granted.
It is understood that Earn will attempt
to show tnat he had a right to carry the
howitzer, even into the prize-ing, because
ne is a deputy United States Marshal.
KILLING OF BIOKS.
J. R. Mitchell on Trial for Murder in
Judge Bahrs' Court.
The trial of J. R. Mitchell, charged
with the muraer ot Edward Hides, was
begun in Judge Banra' court yesterday
morning.
Rev. J. B. Warren testified that he was
n hiÃ office across the corridor from the
room occupied by Mitchell and Hicks.
He heard the first phot, and on going into
the corridor saw Mitchell standing, pistol
in hand, at the head of the stairway.
Hicks was distant some few feet and re
treaiins in the direction of his (Warren's)
office. The witness saw Mitchell fire two
shots and then Hicks fell. After the
shooting the witness saw Mitchell put the
pistol into his pocket ana go down the
stairway.
Mr. Warren was the only eye-witness to
the tiring of the last shot.
Attorney R. A. Friedrich testified that
he heard the shots and rushed to the door.
He saw a man who looked like Mitchell
on the stairs putting a pistol in his over
coat pocket.
A. S. Grant, whose office is near the
apartments in which the tragedy oc
curred, heard Hicks exclaim just before
the shooting, "Take your hands off me!"
Hick-i spoke as If laboring under excite
ment.
Further testimony will be taken to-day.

AN IDLE FLEET
IN OAKLAND CREEK
Nearly Eighty Vessels Are
Tied Up in the
Estuary.
Some of Them Have Been There
for Years and Are Now
Fast in the Mud.
The Harbor Commissioners Discover
a Job io the Bids for the Mail
Company's Shed.
While shipping has picked up wonder
fully during: the past month there is still
an enormous fleet tied up in Oakland
Creek outside of those in Mission Bay,
Richardson Bay and Martinez. All classes
of crafts are represented. There is the
whaler returned from a successful or un
successful trip to the Arctic, the sugar boat
that finds it unprofitable to run any more
to Hawaii, the lumber schooner that can
not make it pay to carry lumber from
coastwise ports, British ships that have
anchored there to await a charter and
steamers that are awaiting better times.
The etuary i* the most crowded portion
of the State's water-front and no where
else in America can a greater variety of
craft be seen.
The Lark Annie Johnson is among the
fleet and the Grenada keeps her company.
Tiif steamer Kahului is in the mud and
the Kodiak awaits next spring to start for
the Arctic. All in all there are over ninty
vessels tied up in the creek and 90 per cent
of them are likely to remain there until
after McKinley's inauguration. Then
wn-.n protection is again in force there
may be something for American shipping
to do.
The only arrivals yesterday were the
Ardencraig from Newcastle, N. 8. W. ,
the Win tesboro from Gre- nwood and the
Mineola from Comax, B. f!. Several ves
sels sailed during the day, so the fleet in
port has not been increased.
State Harbor Policeman Mooney had a
peculiar experience yesterday. He caught
a young man in the act of stealing a sack
of beans from JacKson-street wharf. He
had loaded it into a buggy belonging to
the J. B. Bocarde Drayage Company when
caught and attempted to get away.
Mooney stopped him and, getting upon
the seat, ordered tho iad to drive to the
Harbor police station. The prisoner re
fus d point blank, so the policeman had
to drive himself. At the corner of Clay
and East streets the young man made a
jump, and before Mooney could stop the
horse he was out of siuht. Captain Uun
leavy has a regular officer on the case, but
the chances are that the thief will never
be h u ard from a -am.
There is weeping and wailing and
g.i. hing n teeth in Mare Island to-night.

each time they want to come to San
Francisco or visit the navy-yard.
The whole trouble is over a anestlon of
wharfage. The Harbor Commissioners
have decided that in future the navy-yard
tug must pay whenever she lands at one
of the ytate wharves. This means an ex
penditure of what the commandant is not
warranted in shouldering. Consequently
the officers will have to pay the wharfage
or travel by the regular line of steamers.
"All United States vessels pay wharfage
in other ports," said President Colnon
yesterday, "and why not in San Fran
cisco? The Sunol, Monticello.and Herald
that ply between here and the -navy-yard
and Vallejo have to pay their lull dues
and run opposition to a United States
vessel that pays no wharfage. It wasn't
fair and now all the craft are on the
same footing. The Umatilla must pay
wharfage just the same as any other
craft."
In the same connection the lighthouse
tender, Madrone, will also have to pay
wharfaga. Tbis means that in future she
will coal at Goat Island and tne men,
when they want a run ashore, will have to
take a boat and row over to Lon Â» wharf,
Oakland, and then come to San Francisco
by steamer. It is hard on Uncle Sam's
men, but "what is sauce for the goose
should be sauce for the gander," and the
Harbor Commission will have just so â 
much more space at its disposal in future.
The trouble between Captain Hicks of
the Manchester an i Balfour, Guthrie &
Co. has been amicably settled. The mas
ter has agreed to accept the sacks in which
the wheat is being placed aboard and has
receipted for all that is now in the vessel's
hold. Her stiffening is now nearly all in,
and in a couple of days the vessel will go
to Port Costa to load.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday and opened bids for the
construction of a shed on the wharf De
tween the Mail dock and Fremont street,
now being got ready for the Pacific Mail
and Occidental and Oriental Company.
They were as follows: F. A.Williams,
$(J098: J. H. McKay, $6070; Thomas H.
Day, $5983; Healy, Tibbits & Co., $5978.
Commissioner Cole had a short talk with
Chief Engineer Holmes and then moved
that ali the bids be rejected. President
Colnon promptly put the motion and it
was earned. New bids wer- ordered called
for, and the advertisement will appear in
the Post. It transpired later that the Com
missioners thought there was collusion
among the bidders, hence their action.
Incoming coas ers report the sealing
schooner Eppineer as doing remarkably
well. She only left. here last Friday for a
cruise along the coast, but even in that
short Bpaceor time fifty skins have been
taken. Last reports state tnat Captain
White was doing well and that all the
boats were nut. A year ago the Eppinger
took 1363 -kiks in seven months off the
Golden Gate.
The Luisa D is over here from Oakland
Creek but cannot secure hunters at the
figure the managing owner is willing to
pay. Should skins sell in London to-day
at a fair figure the men will get what they
ask, if not, the schooner is liable to go in
to retirement again. Captain Sam Burtis,
who is in command oi her, is one of the

MEN, WHY WILL YOU BE WEAK ? WHY DO YOU NOT
listen to the echo of thousands of grateful voices raised in
thanks to Dr. Sundeji's Electric Belt ? Why do you go on from
day to day realizing that you are losing your nerve force, your
manhood, when you see a cure within your grasp ? Reach for it,
take it to your heart and feel the life blood flowing, jumping,
dancing through your veins ; feel the exhilarating spark of
manly power warm you frame, the bright flash come to your
eye and the firm grip to your hand â the grip which clasps your
fellow-man and tells him that you have found your Mccca â you
have regained your manhood. Act to-day ; do not delay a mat-
ter which is the key to your future happiness ; do not allow a
disease to destroy all possibility of future pleasure for you.
Whatever your condition to-day you will not improve as you grow
older. Age calls for greater vital force, and the older you get the
more pronounced and apparent will be your weakness ; so cure
it now â cure it while you are young. The time is ripe. While
the vital spark is still warm it can easily be fanned to flame by'
Electricity, and Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt will make you strong
if you try it now.
It Cured These Men :
SAX JOSE, Cal., Dec. 8, 1896.
DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir : Three years ago I was taken suddenly with a
nervous affection in the upper portion of my spine between my shoulders. I felt a
cold chill run down my back, and since tben I have had a continual pain. I have
taken a great deal of medicine for ruy trouble, but found nothins that would relieve
my pain until 1 got your belt. I put it on at right and ii relieves the pain at once
and warms my whole body from my head to my feet. I can now sleep sound, some-
thing I cculd not do until 1 got your belt. I have recommended it to several of my
friends, and shall nhvays speak a good word for it. A. B. GRAVES.
L'! 4 North Third street.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Dec. 8, 1896.
DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: At the time I bought your belt I was so nervous
and shaky that 1 could not do any work without feeling perfectly exhausted. I had
what is called nervous debility lrom excessive drinking and other excesses, i was
practically on my las: legs. My powers were all gone and I was satisfied that I was a
wreck. Ihad spent over $300 lor medicines witho.it the slightest benetit, when I
â was advised to get your Belt. I felt an improvement a- 30on as I commenced to wear
it. I continued steadily improving until I now feel as strong as 1 ever aid in my life.
I feel very crateful to you for what your belt has done for^ me. and shall cheerfully
recommend it to anyone in like condition. H. KNOWLTON,
219 Tehama St., City.
"I write these few lines to let you know that lam feeling tine. I have gained in
weight and strength. My back does not ache any more. lam not so nervous, and,
better still, I can work hard all day without feeling tired at night as I nsed to. I
sleep sound and awake refreshed. I have gained nine pounds since I started to use
your belt," writes Jesus Espino^a, Mountain View, Cal., Nov. 1, 1896.
"The belt I bought of you six months aeo has entirely cured me of nervous de-
bility and kidney troubles. I Jeel better than I ever did before in my life. It has
made a new man of me. I will ylarlly recommend your belt, as it surely does all you
claim for it," writes I'aul Wattersteln, Visalia, Cal.. November 21. 189tj.
i wouid like to add my testimony to the numerous others in possession of Dr. SanÂ«
den's Electric: Belt Co. I purchased a strong-power Beit Irom Dr. Sanden about the
lBt of April, which 1 used according to directions, and after three months I am happy
to state mat my vancocele, which was of twelve years' standing, is almost entirely
disappeared, the veins being almost normal. I tike great pleasure in recommending
â tbe IJelt to any one suffering from varicocelo. "
W. E. JOHNS. 1139 Market street, San Franciico.
"I am feeling fine; the lossos are all slopped, and I nave gained eleven pounds in
twenty-eieht days," writes J. L. Tiberguein, Angels Camp, Cai., September 10, 1896.
And It Will Cure You.
No man can appreciate the depth of this subject who does
not study it. No one knows wherein he is weak unless he com-
pares his condition with another ; no one knows the means of
curing unless some one tells him. Five hundred grateful men
describe their cure by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt for your benefit
in the little book, "Three Classes of Men," which will be sent
sealed, free, by mail. It is full of plain, honest statements from
men who have laid aside all scruples of delicacy to tell their
fellow-men what happiness has been brought to them by this
famous Electric Belt. If you are not sure that you need it you
can be examined by Dr. Sanden free of charge and he will advise
you. He charges for nothing but the belt, which is within the
reach of every sufferer. This is a prize which no weak man
should deny himself â health and happiness. Read the book, free.

THE KERAMIC SHOW.
It Will Last Only To-Day and Then the
Baodaome Pouters "Will
Be Sold.
Tuere was a large attendance of people
at the Keramic Exhibition yesterday in
the marble-room of the Palace. The ex
hibit is large and the specimens of keramic
in many cases very fine. To-day will be
the last day of the show, and to-night the
artistic posters which have advertised the
exhibit will be put up for sale.
Among the fine keramic worK shown
was a jardiniere, by Miss Nettie Sinnott.
It was exquisitely decorated with repre
sentations of La France, Marechal jfiel
and other rose.-, and was very beautifr.!.
There was also a handsome fernery dish,
decorated with lerns, green tinting* .iik!
gold by the same lady. Miss Lillian R ch
ardson had a large banquet lamp, in
acorna, with cream t intuits and gold, a
tankard pitcher in ivy joaves and forpet
menots. They were both very beautifully
done. Mis* Sinnott and Miss KichardMon
each had a blackberry bowl also, with
blackberries and the leaves of The bush
artistically portrayed. There were only a
few of these exhibits.
Mrs. Murphy of San Jose exhibited
some novel work of the nrst-nanied lady
in a bon-bon box, picture frame, flower
bowl and loiiet set, all of which were
decorated by violets. The imitation Dres
den work, with the treatment of ieds
and greens, showed clever handling.
There were many other exhibits, each of
which had its characteristic value. Mrs.
S. V. Culpand MrÂ«. M. E. Perley of this
City exhibited a large vase in the Grecian
style, on which was beautifully portrayed
a young man with an enormous bunch of
flowers which he was bestowing on a beau
tiful girl. The vase was brought from
Europe and decorated. There was a unique
tobacco jar in paste and etched gold and a
?able in pink and a lamp in red roses, both
of which were noteworthy.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
INSANE WITH A
QUARTER MILLION
Fred Riener's Good Fortune
\Led to His Mental
Derangement.
Ida Blythe Testified That the
Young Man Was Drunk
for Two Months.
He Is Adjudged Dangerous to Ba at
Large and Must Have a Guar
dian Appointed.
Fred Riener, tbe young man who re
cently fell heir to $250,000 by the death of
his mother in Germany, and who has
since been spending his mor.ey too freely
in tbe tenderloin districts cf San Fran
cisco and Sausalito, was taken before the
Commissioners of Lunacy to be'examit ed
as to his mental condition yesterday morn
ing.
Riener does not appear to be over 26
years of age. He is very red of face, and
his personal appearance betoKens a man
who is suffering from some severe mental
strain. His frame is attenuated and his
hands, though large and muscular look
ing, twitch constantly in a nervous way.
He took with him into tbe courtroom a
tin box containing a number of private
papers and other personal effect?. He
opened thÂ« box and arranged his things
on the table in front of him, but was pre
vailed on to put them away until the trial
was over.
Upon taking his seat before the Com
missioners ltiener's first act was to direct
the bailiff to lower the window curtain, re
marking that the light hurt his eyes.
Ida Blythe, the young woman with
whom Riener has been associated for a
couple of months, testified that she was
present when he signed the remarkab'e
contract by which he agreed to simply uer
with ruenn3 for traveling, board and lodg
ing and clothing in consideration of her
! promise to live with h:m and not to asso
j ciate with any other person. She thought
j he was drnnk when he signed the paper.
â¢'Since you have Known Riener has ho
I had any intervals of sobriety ?" asked
j Judge Hebbard.
"I think not," replied the witness
i frankly.
Miss Blythe said that Riener drew a
i pistol and threatened to shoot her because
I he thought she was mocking him. Me
made some remark in broken German-
English, and when she repeated it he be
i came very angry and declared be would
1 kill her.
Viola le Page, a friend of Miss Blythe's,
corroborated the statement that Riener
j had bean intoxicated for two months.
j He had acted strangely and had ihreat
j ened to kill them. On one occasion he
put a pistol to the head of the witness and
, threatened to shoot her, but she escaped.
Miss le Pa>;e admitted that she had seen
Riener spend considerable money, but
she couldn't say how much. It was not
$200 a day. The last time he threatened
to kill the witness was the day before
Thanksgiving day.
Commissioner Lustiggave it as his opin
ion that Kicner is a dangerous person to
I Lc at lurge, whereupon Judge Hebbard
said it would be his duty to commit tho
patient to a public insane asyJu :>, unless
some of his friends should be willing to
bind themselves to care for him in a
private sanitarium or in a home for in
ebriates.
Charles Zinkand was the only friend
who volunteered a suggestion. He said
the mar. appeared better and that he ex
pected to start for Europe in a few days,
so he thought it might be safe to allow
him a chance to go.
Dr. Lustic gave it as his opinion th^ it
would be daneerous to the patient and
the public to let him go without restraint ;
that he is suffering from the be^in'ung; ot
paralysis, and would not be able to go to
Europe alone. He might become violent
or altogether demented at any moment.
He suid he had learned t' at before
Reiner's sudden access to affluence he
had been a man of frugal habits and was
economical to the verge of parsimony.
Good fortune seemed to have turned his
head.
Judge Hebbard said he deemed it his
daty to send Riener to an asylum and ac
cordingly signed an order committing
him to Ufciah. The court announced that
if at any time the patient's friends de
cided to apply for guardianship they
could do so, and if his interests required
he could betaken to Germany, where the
bulk of his estate is located.

THE BAILROAD COMMISSION.
I It Will Meet To-Day and May Start to
Fix i if ight and Fare Kates.
The Railroad Commissioners will bold
I a meeting this, afternoon, the first since
the recent decision affecting its status was
rendered.
"I cannot say what wiil be done at the
meeting in regard to the decision," said
Commissioner Stanton yesterday, "as I
! have not had. any talk with any of the
| other Commissioners. It will probably bo
i discussed and possibly some action may
be taken as to whether or not an appeal
will be taken.
"Now tLat the status of thevjm mission
has been legally denned it is likely that
we will start in and fix rates of freights
and fares. Heretofore the commission
was unable to do anything because of that
injunction, but now that it is free to act it
wiil no doubt act."

SEVERAL VIOLENT DEATHS.
Ethel Kane Killed by Bad Meat, Not
Bad Milk. '
Coroner Hawkins held four inquests yes
terday to officially determine the causes of
four cases of death by violence. That of
little Ethel Kane of 147 Tehama street was
the most interesting. The child was only
5 years of age and she came to her death
on November 29 from what was supposed
then to be poison produced by the im
proper preparation of condensed or canned
mill:. However, a careful analysis of the
milk and even the. tea consumed- by the
fanuly showed both to be of the purest
quality. The child's father became ill at
the same timp, but he recovered. After
considering all the evidence; the Coroner's
jury came to the conclusion that; little
Ethel died of ptomaine poisoning, that
her death was accidental and : caused by
eating, decomposed animal or ., vegetable
matter. -. , â 
On December 1 Fillipo Cadallano, an
Italian crab catcher, was drowned off
Lands End, his boat having been over
turned in the breakers. A verdict of acci
dental death was returned.
A few days ago Foong Ah Get, wbo was
arrested for murdering one of his country
men, committed suicide in the City
Prison by hanging himself. A verdict in
accordance with the facis was returned.
John Devlin, a laundryman living at 121
Fourteenth street, while cleaning his
revolver on the 4;h inss., shot himself in
the lung and bled to death. A verdict of
accidental death was returneJ by the jury.
On November 28, an unknown man was
found in Golden Gaie Park suffering from
morphine poisoning. h.o was sent to the
Receiving Hospital, where hÂ« died. The
jury returned a verdict in accordance with
these facts.
SCHOOLS NOT TO BLAME
The Spread of Diphtheria At
tributed to a Pond of
Stagnant Water.
Six New Cases, Spread Over a Wide
Area, R. ported at the Health
Office Yesterday.
Dr. Fitzgibbon of the Board of Health
has concluded that the vaults of public
schools are not altogether responsible for
the spread of diphtheria in the Mission.
He told the board at its meeting yester-
day that he had found a pond of stagnant
water near the corner of Seventeenth and
Temple streets and attributed several
deaths that had occurred in the neighbor
hood to its evil influences. He asked that
the owner of the property be required to
abate the nuisance at once.
He stated that be had heard that some
of the houses had no patent vaults and
that therj had been some five or six
deaths within "250 feet of the pond. He
had been called during the morning, he
said, to see three childsen suffering from
diphtheria in this neighborhood.
Health Inspector Duren snid that he had
endeavored to locate the owner of this
property, but was unable to find him.
The Mayor asked that a more thorough
search be instituted for the owner and the
man given time to abate the nuisance.
Dr. Fitzgibbon moved that a notice be
: ent to the owner, and if the nuisance was
not abated within forty-eight hours the
property should be condemned without
further 'action of the board. This action
was taken.
That the vaults of the schools accused
of spreading the disease are not entirely
responsible for the mischief is shown by
the wide area over which yesterday's
cases were distributed. There wsre six
new cases reported as follows: 501 Harri
son street, Ninth avenue and X street,
2307 Broadway and three cases at 38 Ser
pentine avenue.
None of these can be traced directly to
the thr?e public schools that the Board of
Health attempted unsuccessfully to close.

A PASSING OPPORTUNITY,
Final Announcement Kegarding Those
Special Lncycloptedlc Dictionaries.
A few days ago the Pacific Coast News
paper Syndicate began a distribution of a
number of slightly marred .sets, which had
accumulated in packing, unpacking and
handling the many thousands of volumes
which were some time since distributed to
readers to introduce the work.
The covers on one or more of these
special sets were rubbed a little â so little,
indeed, that few purchasers at the regular
price of $42 to $70 a set would have any
cause for complaint.
As a matter of fact, these special set 3
are juÂ»t as good as new for all practical
purposes, and would compare favorably
with any absolutely perfect $12 to ?70 set
that had seen a few days' use in borne,
library or office.
The price which the syndicate has ar
ranged for one of these special sets is
surely attractive to any one earnestly de
siring to own a strictly hign-grade refer
ence work at a trifl;ng cost.
The four volumes will be sent to any ad
dress on payment of $1, and if on exami
nation they are not &<* represented, they
can be returned and tho money will be re
funded. 11 satisfactory, the" small bal
ance is payable in easy monthly amounts.
This is certainly a rare opportunity,
especially for those who may have thought
the former low introductory price even
too high for their mean?.
The value of the work, both as a dic
tionary and an encyclopaedia, is most
thoroughly appreciated by readers,and tbÂ«y
are besieging Syndicate lieadquirters at
14 Sansome street to secure tlie sets.
THE CHILDS MURDER.
John Miller Held to Answer Before the
Superior Court.
John Miller, the carpenter who shot and
killed James H. Childs on Clementina
street last month, was yesterday held to
answnr before the Superior Court by Judge
Joachimsen on the charge of murder.
Miller had been living with a divorced
woman' named Ryan and she left him.
On the afternoon of the murder he went
to a house on Clementina street in search
of her. She ran into the street followed
by Miller, who tired several shots at her,
missing hÂ»r. She ran into the house oc
cupied by the Chiids family and James
grappled with Miller, who Â»hoi and killed
Him.
Had Plenty of Money.
Emma Holzberger, a little old woman who
lives on the tan Bruno road, was crossing
Howard and Eighth street* yesterday after
noon when she was knocked down by a horse
driven by F. K. McKenzie, an agent for a tea
house. She was taken to tbe Receiving Hos
pital, where it *vas lound that her right shoul

with the murder of Ajostiuo Parent! by ad
ministering poison to him in a glass of wine

SOW MR, DOCKERY
IS NOT WILLING
Objects to an Investiga
tion of the Alleged
Blackmail.
Attorney Clunie Presents a
Demurrer for the Milk
Inspector.
S^ys the Only Relief in a Charge of
This Kind Is an Appeal to
the B:ari of Health.
Milk Inspector James P. Dockery ap
peared in Judte Hunt's court wearing a
blue flannel sbirt with a tall collar like
that of a fashionable woman's cloak.
It was expected that Mr. Dockery
wouid at once demand a full investigation
of the charges made by Ruhland & Zim
merman that Mr. Dockery and Market In
spector Bob Davis had attempted to levy
blackmail, but he permitted his* attorney,
A. J. Clunie, to file a demurrer to the com
plaint.
The specific accusation is that several
weeks ago Dockery and Davis approached
a member of the rirra of Ruhiand & Zim
merman, who are engaged in the dairying
business, and offered for $600 to have a
pretended examination of their cows made
with the purpose of procuring a fraudulent
certificate that said cows are healthy. Be
cause of this alleged attempt to levy black
mail the accusers assert that Dockery is
unnt to hold the ottice of Miik Inspector,
and application was accordingly made to
have him ousted lrom office. An nmend
ment to the original case was also offered,
giving as a f uriner reason lor removing
aim that his intemperate habits unfit him
for the performance of his Unties.
Mr. Clunie began his opposition to the
complaint by serving a copy of his demur
rer on Attorney M. M. Estee, who repre
nented the complaining v/itness. The
demurrer stated that the proceedings
against Dockery were not legal, the princi
pal point being that the complaint was
framed under section 772 of the Penal
Code, which section does not say anything
about ousting a man from office lor al
leged blackmail.
The section was read, and it was pointed
out that it says proceedings to deprive a
man of his office may be had for collecting
illegal fees or for neglect of duty, but for
no other reasons.
There is no allegation in the complaint,
Mr. Clunie said, to show tnat Dockery had
collected any illegal fees or that he had
neglected his duties. The charge is simply
blackmail, and, that ought to be tried in
another vray.
In addition to this point Mr. Clunie
read from the statutes and the code to
establish his contention that Dockery is
not and never has been a public officer
within the meaning of the law; that he is
really a mere employe of the Board of
Health, with no fixed term or tenure, and
holds his place entirely at the pleasure of
that board. This being the case, Mr.
Clunie argued that application for Dock
ery's dismissal must be made only to the
Board of Health. If Doclcery had b?en
guilty of criminal acts ha could be indict
ed by the Grand Jury.
Supreme Court d> cisions in the cases of
Park Commissioner Stowe and Assessor
Siebe were cited to establish this view oi
the case, and Mr. Ciunie Maid that the
highest tribunal of the S;ate had given an
interpretation of the intention of the Leg
islature, and he thought it was never the
intention of the Legislature to have an
employe of a county officer or a public
board dragged into court every time there
was a disputÃ with any citizen or outside
party. If such a rule as that were al-
Jowed any police officer on the iorca might
be called into court to answer charges of
misconduct. The Supreme Court of New
York decided that the Police Commission
ers were the proper persons to take cog
nizance of all such affairs relating to the
employes of the Police Department â that
the courts had no jurisdiction of such
matters.
Touching the allegation of drunkenness
in office, Mr. Clunie demnrred to ttiat
charge on the ground that the statute of
1880, which appears in Deering's Penal
code under section 77, removes the ques
tion of drunkenness from the purview of
section 772 of the Penal Code. Besides, the
statute of 1880 relates only to City and
County officers, and Dockery being merely
an employe of tho Board of Health, and
not a public officer in the contemplation
of the law, cannot be proceeded against
in this way.
A spirited discussion took place between
the lawyers with regard to which side wan
asking for delay, and it was finally con
ceded that both parties to tho suit were
willing to proceed as soon as convenient.
Mr. Estee informed the court that he
desired a few days to examine the authori
ties presented by Mr. Clunie, and the case
was continued until next Monday after
noon at 2 o'clock.
Rocking cradles for babies were used by
the Egyptians many centuries before
Christ. Among the pictures copied by
Belzoni is one of an Egyptian mother at

The New Lights on Kearny Street
V;Â° ..; V May Be Turned On Next
. ] : ' . Saturday Night.
.â -..â¢- The progressive merchants of Kearny
street have concluded to take a hand in
Â° .the' special illumination of streets which
"â¢ now seems to be so popular. Consider
ing the progress that is being made
i Keajrny, street before the end of this week
, will be a biazo. of glory at night, from
Geary street as far as Montgomery avenue.
'â¢' Â° Several leading merchants talked over
'the scheme a few days ago, and decided to
ask the Merchants' Exchange to help
them to carry it out. The exchange lent
â¢. Â° a willing hand through Secretary Freud
J atKi Ass istant Secretary King. Canvass-
R erdowere" at once put into the field, and
ers were at once put into the field, and
11 such success has been met with that there
l( is now no doubt that the street will be
: brilliantly illuminated.
..;. Employes of the electric light company
.have been at work two day? stringing
wires and hanging the new arc lights.
- : By Saturday night it is expected to turn
â¢on. the new lights for the first time, at
â¢' tea's! as far down as California street.
.!â¢.: Three new arc lights will be suspended
â¢'â¢ in each block. One will be in the center
of each street intersection, and the other
two distributed at equal distances through
; the block. With the large- number of
: â¢ -tfrivate arc and incandescent lights already
v luvrhing"on the street three additional
; ones, it is thought, will give all the illu
nii-nation desirable if hung in the cen
-.. ter of the street, where the light rays
; rriaj'; shoot out in all directions. The
; property-owners agree to pay at the rate
ett.'i'even cents per front foot, and the ten
; ants. four cents a front foot for the new
' lights.
" '": : It has been reported that so far the
, â property-owners on Kearny street, be
â¢ * tween Clay and Washington, have been
I jlo.w in responding. There are compara
tively few property-owners in this block,
the City owning the major part of the
1 property there in the park and new mu
nicipal building site. The City will be
asked to contribute its pro rata share of
ft expense of lights in the block.
0 The merchants on the north side of Sut
ler, street, between Kearny and Mont
gomery, from the alley nearly to Kearny
street, have decided to do a little lighting
of ; their own in a way that the prome
nad-;rs on Kearny street may not pass it
- by unnoticed. They have hung up Jap-
c, tuese lanterns and propose to throw a red,
bide and green tinge into the glare of that
i vicinity.
The merchants of Third street are also
;:i line for street improvement and greater
attractiveness in the way of light. They
prnvo.Â«e to have Third street illuminated
with six arc lights to a block, from Mar
ke: to Townsend street. The Merchants'
Association was asked yesterday ;o co
.operate and consented to do so.
H'j^o "D. Keil, a director in the Mer
cbanti' Association, is a Third-street
property-owner. He and se\eral mer
chants started out yesterd&y to see other
chants started out yesterday to sÂ°e other
property-owners and secure subscriptions.
NINTH STREET, TOO.
rhls Will Be Illuminated From Mar
ket to Howard Street.
The business men on Ninth street, be
ween Market and Howard, are determined
:hat they shall not be classed among the
;ilurians, and they, too, are joining in the
procession of progression. They are going
:o organize an improvement club, and will
isk that the thoroughfare on which tney
ire engaged in business be made as at
ractive as possible, bu; first of all they
.Till light up with arc lights, as has been
lone on Polk, Sixth and other streets.
M. A. Owens of Starr & Owens of 7 Ninth
street, who is also engaged in business on
Sixth street, concluded that if lignt was
good for trade on Sixth street there was
no good reason why it should not be good
an Ninth. Yesterday forenoon be started
to. canvass the business men on the street,
iiml at the end of three hour 3he had se
cured twenty-nine signatures to contracts
to Ucht up the street for a period of six
months. Mr. Owens said:
'Ninth street, from Market to Howard,

ness point of view during the day there is
no reason why it should not be a live one
during the evenings of the week. In my
canvass today I met with but one refusal
and there were a number who asked time
until to-day or to-morrow to consider the
matter. Sixty contracts will have to be
secured before the company will put up
the lights. From the promises I received
I am confident that that number will be
secured Wednesday afternoon.
"It is proposed to light up but two
blocks for the present â that is, as far south
as Howard street. Now, if the people
south of that line want improvements
they will have to appoint a committee to
get signatures. There will be, as on Sixth
street, six lights to a block, and when the
sixty signatures are secured the contracts
will be turned over to the Merchants' As
sociation, which will see that the lights are
put in."

CAROLINE KUSEL'S PLAINT.
â
A Fair Young Wife Tired of Her Rich
Old Husband.
The complaint for divorce filed by Caro
. line Kusel against Solomon Kusel yester
! day is another revelation of the difficulty
! which grows out of marriage when the
; husband is old and homely and the wife
i is quite the reverse.
Mrs. Kusel's complaint alleges that her
husband is quite wealthy and that he gets
a good income from valuable real estate
and several big houses. She says he
promised her every comfort and a happy
home, but that as soon as the wedding
I ceremony was over his demeanor changed I
i and that his treatment of her was that of a
I 'ruel, crabbed, harsh, penurious and pet
tish man.
All promises of comfort were disre
garded and Kusel insisted on miserly
methods in conducting the household. He
i used vile language to her and frequently <
I threatened her life, at one time forcing !
her from their house at 1151 Guerrero
street.
She says her health has been impaired
by her husband's treatment, asks permis
sion to resume her maiden name, demands
a large share of the property and wants to |
have it paid to her in Dulk lest her hus
band should die and leave her without
alimony or other means of support.
WHEN WILL YOU MARRY?
A Witness Says He Heard Judge
Hastings Ask This of
Mrs. Keller.
Said Be Had Lots of Money and
Could Keep H-r Like
a Lady.
The deposition of Thomas J. Durand
; was taken yesterday afternoon before a
notary in the office oi Sullivan & Sulli
van in the matter of the contest of the will
of the late Judge Hastings.
. Durand is a miner, and intends to leave
I the City on r a prospecting tour in a few
days, which is the reason for taking the
' deposition at this time. He testified that
i he lodged in the house kept by Mrs. Kel
' ler, the contestant and putative widow, in
1876, at 225 O'Farrell street; that he fre
quently met Judge Hastings there when
the latter came to call upon his landlady;
that she frequently spoKe to him of the
; Judge as a salvor for her hand ; that one
1 evening he (the witness) was in the front
parlor when the Judge called to pay his
addresses to Mr-. Keller. They were seated j
in the back parlor, he said, the sliding !
doors being not altogether closed, so that ]
the witness could both see them and hear j
their conversation. He distinctly heard |
the Judge say to Mrs. Keller, "Well, Mol
he, when are you going to marry me?"
To this be heard Mrs. Keller reply "Ob,
after a while."
"I have got plenty of money and can
keep you like a lady," said the Judge.
At this point the witness, so he said, be
came convinced that this was not a con
versation intended for his ears and he left
the room. This was his story, supporting
the claims oi Mrs. Keller that she is Mrs.
Hastings.
Samuel M. Shortridge, representing cer
tain of the respondents, cross-questioned
the witness at great length. He brought
out the fact that a friend of the witness,
Ben Virgil by name, was with him at the
time referred to. Virgil was a lover of
Mrs. Keller himself and was theiefore so
interested in the scene that he refused to
leÂ«ve the room with Durand, though re
quested ;o do Â«o. Virgil is now dead.
When Mrs. Keller njoved her lodging
house from O'Farrell to 858 Mission street,
the witness went with her and there, also,
frequently met Ju ge Hastings, he said.
The witness left this Gity in 1879 and has
been out of the State nearly all the time
since then.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
VALLEY ROAD ALL READY
10 BUILD INTO BAKERSFIELD
The Only Serious Obstacle That Is Now Encountered
Is the Lack of the Through Right of Way
From Fresno.
RAILS AND TIES ON THE
GROUND.
Within Four Months the Road
Could Be Rushed to Com
pletion.
DEPOTS AND WATER STATIONS
BEING ESTABLISHED.
Special Excursion Trains With Re
duced Fares to Be Run to ik
Fresno.
Notwithstanding the fact that extension
work on the San Francisco and San Joaq
Valley Railway has been temporarily dis
j continued, there is no cessation in activity
along the portion of the line already com
pleted, comprising 125 miles between
Stockton and Fresno.
In order to give the earliest . possible re
lief to the producers and merchants of the
j valley from the extortionatte charges jof
I the Southern Pacific the road was opened
for freight before the proper . ac
commodations could be provided lor most
J conveniently handling freight. It is .'to
remedy these shortcomings that the most
energetic efforts are now being put forth.
The improvements now under way com
prise sidings, freight and passenger de
pots at several of the stations and a round
house and turntable at Fresno.
Merced and Escalon have already each
I been provided with a combination freight
I and passenger depot, and similar struc
j tures are going up at Elm wood, Geneva,
La Grand and Lankershim. Jtiach of these
will cose about $5000. At Fresno an im
mense freight depot is rapidly assuming
shape on Q street, between j Kern and
Inyo. A portion of this is to be used
temporarily as a passenger. depot, and by
spring a handsome and commodious pas
senger depot will be commenced. The
freight depot alone at this point is to cost
$8000.
The combination structures at Eacalon,
Elmwood, Geneva, La Grand and Lanker
shim will not only afford accommodations
for passengers and the handling of freight,
but overhead will be living-rooms for the
station agent of the company. ' -...*.,/
Work on the roundhouse and the turn
! table, for which the contracts were re
cently awarded, is well advanced. .
Extension work south of Fresno will in
I all probability not .be begun until the
â  early part of February. The bonds which it
â  is proposed to sell to provide funds for the
I construction of the road between Fresno
I and Ba^ersfieid and between Stockton and
i San Francisco are still in the engraver's
I hands, .and it is not likely that any at-
I tempt will be made to float them until
S after the new year dawns.
But this will not 1 interfere with track
I construction south of Fresno. .-The next
obstacle to progress in that direction is the
â  lack of a continuous right of way. As
already announced there will be two lines
out of Fresno, One will run via Hanford |
I and the other probably via Reedley and j
j Visalia. The two lines will come together j
I again south of Hanford, near Lake Tnlare.
I The ultimate route of the Reed ley- |
1 branch will depend largely on concessions
made'by; land-owners in the matter .of
right of way and depot sites. Local com
mittees are now engaged â  securing the
right of way;
Material for this extension is now. being
i stacked up at Fresno. The rails have al
! ready been ordered sufficient to lay the
j entire track from Fresno to Bakersfield.
{ A large portion of them are now at 'Fres
{ no and the remainder are on the way.
j There is also a larpe quantity of ties and
, trimmings on hand.
As soon as the through right of way is
j secured the work of construction will be
rushed. From the present outlook a start
I will not be possible before February, but
â  when once the first rail is laid south of
1 the limits of Fresno it will not be more
I than four months before Bakersfield will
I be enjoying the same lull ami substantial
I benefits of railroad competition that have
j proved such a blessing and relief to the
I people between Stockton and Fresno. .
The only check to putting the 110 miles
i of track between Fresno and Bakersheld
I down at the rate of a mile a day will be
! the three big bridges that will have to be
j erectedâ two over the Kings River and
one over the Kern. Each of these struct
ures is to cost $30,000. . All the plans are
ready, but the material has not yet been
ordered, nor can it or will it be until the
right of way situation is cleared of all un
certainty. rjX'i
The company's rolling stock is sufficient
to operate the entire 235 miles between
Stockton and Bakerslield, at least for the
present.
Among other important improvements [
in progress is the establishment of water 1
stations at Stockton, Escalon, Elmwood,
La Grand, Lankershim and Fresno. Wells
are being sunk, and pumps and tanks
: erected. The expense at each station
: thus equipped will not be less than $1500.
; At, Merced and Fresno the water will be

BATTLES ON TAP.
Occidental Club'Â» Entertainment Mon
day Nightâ .Johnson and Van
Buskirk.
The Occidental Athletic Club has al
ready commenced to arrange for its enter
tainment, which will be held in Wood
ward's Pavilion next Monday evening.
Young Mitchell, the director-general of
the club, said last evening that he will
not select a gun-fighter to refsree the con
tests; that there are any number of men
in this City who thoroughly understand
the fistic game, and one of them will be
chosen.
"The referee cuts a very important fig
ure in pugilism"; said Mitchell, "in fact,
n referee who is inclined to give unfair de
cisions can very soon put a damper on the
sport, and, of course, the ones to suffer
most are the clubs and the pugilists. You
can bet that the Occidental Club will not
tolerate any lunny business if lean help it.
We have two first-class Eastern men who
will put up a great tight. This man Gans,
who will meet Bochette in a ten-round
contest, is one of the best in his class, but
I have every reason to believe that Charley
will give him a hot argument from start
to finish. Now, then, what better attrac
tion could you ask for than the ten-round
bout between Jimmy Anthony and Jack
Ward of Newark, N. J. The Eastern man
has whipped everything of his inches he
has encountered, and he is sanguine of ad
ding another scalp to his belt when he
finishes with the little chunky Australian.
Anthony is much shorter in reach of
arms than his prospective opponent, but
he wili malfe up tor the handicap in this
particular when he pets to mixing things
with tÃe Newark lad. You can gamble on
seeing a fight that will keep your blood
warm, however. Of course, tnere will be
also some preliminary bouts."
Jimmy Anthony is no longer under the
wing of old Barney Farley. Billy Jordan
said last evening that Jimmy ''flew the
coop" a few weeks aao, as Barney was
holding out for too much long green.
Anthony is reported ay being in first-class
shape.
The sports of Sacramento are taking a
very keen interest in 'the Johnson-Van
Buskirk ten-round contest, which will
take place on Friday evening before the
Sacramento Athletic Club. This is what
tne Sacramento Bee says of the men:
Johnson's Sacramento friends have long
hoped t.'iat the Oiympic Club of tan Francisco
would dig up some one to go against him and
when the news of a match between Johnson
and Van Buskirk* was announced it was hailed
with great joy.
It is quite certain that there will be a great
crowd in the old Pavilion on the night of the
11th inst., to witness the ten-round contest.
It will be for a purse of $400, to say nothing ot
the laurels that will be placed upon the brow
of the victor.
"Billy" Johnson feels confident that he is
going to win. This is to be the biggest match
he has ever entered and he is going to do his
level best to beat out Van Buskirk. He knows
that the eyes of Calliornia sports are all turned
toward Sacramento and, it he can do it, he is
going 10 hold up the banner of his home town.
But Johnson is aware of the fact that he has
no picnic ahead ot him. He kuows that Van
Buskirk is recogniz-d as a great boxerâ great
both in science aud strength.
Eddie Greany it is said wiJl soon be in
terested in a new club which will be known
as tne Phoenix Club. In all probability the
first match that will be consummated
will be between George Green of this City
and Tommy Ryan 01 Troyâ that is pro
vided the' last named pugilist can be
induced to journey to this City.
It was reported last evening that the
Golden West Club had closed a contract
between Peter ilaher and Joe Choynski
for a ten-round coniest in this City.
Any num ber of matches are being made,
but the public wiil take little interest in
future events unless it can place some con
fidence in the referees.
MR. LENT ALLEGES FRAUD
Brings Action to Recover $2320
For J. J. O'Farrell's
Creditors.
Claims That Money Was Tnrmd Over
to Treasurer Widber With
Intent to Defraud.
Another suit has been begun in the Su
perior Court as the result of the failure
and assignment of John J. O'Farrell, the
real estate dealer, last summer, and the
vigilance of a lynx-eyed assignee.
Geortre H. Lent, assignee for O'Farrell,
is plaintiff in a suit and petition for au
injunction against lrwin C. Stump; S sson,
Crocker & Co., a corporation ; A. C. Wid
ber, Treasurer, and C. P. Curry, Clerk for
the City and County of San Fran Cisco.
The complaint relates that in October,
1894, Mary T. Moore hied in the Superior
Court a complaint for Marguerite D. Hope
and other owners, asking for a partition
of land and a division of the proceeds;
that the proceedings were had and John
J. O'Farrell. Henry E. Coffey ana Charles
8. O' Byrne were appointed referees to sell
the property.
The property was finally sold for $23,200,
March 31 last. By the terms of sale the
purchaser paid 10 percent of the purchase
price, the remainder on confirmation by
the court, and $2320 was paid and, the com
plaint says, received by O'Farreli; that
O'Farrell had a personal bank account
with the Donohoe-Kelly Banking Com
pany and deposited the $2320 there in his
own personal account; that the deposit
had no distinguishing mark and was net
distinguishable from other money, and all
made but one fund; that the account was
subsequently withdrawn by O Farrell,
who converted it to his own use, and nwer
paid it into court ; that none ot this money
was the money received by O'Faireli on
account of the sale.
The complaint further sets lorth that
all the in crests of Ihe various parties to
the Moore-Hope action, except tho^e of
lrwin U. Stump and Sisson, Crocker
& Co., have been determined ; that
a final decree is expected in v few
days and that the Treasurer will, unless
restrained by order of the court, pay the
money ir. accordance with the tinal judg
ment; that O'Farrell, with a view 01 pre
venting the $2320 from coming into the
hands of his assignee in insolvency and
prevent the same from being distributed
ratab'y among his creditors, and to evade
and defeat th â¢ insolvent debtor act, paid
the money to Treasurer Widber; that
Curry and Widber and the other defend
ants bad come to believe that O'l'arreli
was insolvent and made the payment for
the purposes stated; thai OFarrell's lia
bilities are $104,343 14 and his assets about
$10,000.
Assignee Lent prays the court for judg
ment to the effect that the $2320 be re
turned to him as assets, with interest from
August 29; that a restraining order be
issued diiectinn the Treasurer to keep the
money in his possession pending the ter
mination of this action and ordered to de
[ liver the sum 10 him.
WOODWORTH AS WITNESS.
Asked Pointed Questions by the Defense
in His Libel Suit.
The criminal libel case of D. B. Wood
worth against B. F. Hudelson came up in
Police Judge Campbell's court yesterday.
Donald M. Ross, toe first witness, swore
that he and Wood worth had been unjustly
accused of dishonorable conduct in con
spiring to sell out the A. P. A. organiza
tion to any political party and in conspir
ing to beat John D- Spreckels out of
$55,000 in 3 proposition to sell him a mine.
Judge Campbell ruled that Woodworth
would have to prove publication of
charges and that they are untrue. Wood
worm, who is his own attorney, then be
came a witness in his own behalf. He
denied he had ever conspired with any
body to do wrong.
Attorney Jordan, for Hudelson, then
asked Woodworth to explain about being
expelled from the Canadian Parliament
on account of "crooked and blackmailing
schemes."
Woodworth begged the court's protec
tion, but the court instructed him to
answer the question.
He replied that he had been persecuted
by bad men aeainst whom he had made
charges and he had left Parliament be
cause he refused to apologize for charges
he had made.
In reply to the question by Attorney
Jordan as to whether he had ever "swin
dled General Ga.es out of $1000," Witness
Woodworth hesitated and tinally admitted
he knew a George Gates, with whom he
had trouble over a mine.
In reply to questions as to where the
mine that' is offered 1o Mr. Spreckels is
located, the witness said it is in Amador
County, in the mountainous part; of that
county, but he did not describe its metes
and bounds. When asked if anybody
knows where it is, he replied that his son
does. The witness said at first that he
did not know the age of his son, wno he
said is an expert, but Lter 3aid that he is
about 20 years of aÂ»e. He became con
fused and indignant by turn?. He denied
that he proposed to Hudelson to offer Mr.
SnreckeLs the mine. He denied that
Hudelson had called him a blackmailer
and ordered him out of his office. Wood
wortn promise! to produce his son to
describe the mine, but he was unable to
do so himself. He said he intended to
buy tne mine from a man named Har
lowe.
The case will be resumed at 2 o'clock
this afternoon.

Collided Near Port Costa.
Thomas Collie, Peter Diimiiig, John Ericson
and S. Frederickson, owners of the schooner
Evie, have begun a libel in the United States
District Court against the British bark Ivercoe
ana the tug Vigilant. In their libel they set
forth that on the 4th inst. the schooner was
departing from McNear's wharf, Port Costa,
with 2543 sacks of grain, and swung out on
the ebb tide. The bark, attached to the tup.
rounded the point and collided with the
schooner, making it necessary to bench the
little vessel. The latter was damaged to about
$1000 and the cargo to about $1500. The Ãbel
nnts claims that they were unabeto prevent
the collision, but that the Ivercoe, being un
der the control ot a lug, couid have easily got
out of the way.

their bids were so low that tbe packers were not
willing to trade.
â¢â¢Na 1 native steers, sixty pound* and up, are
considered worth 9*4 c, but the packer* ere seem

have been no sales for more than a week, and It
Icons as though the packers would be compelled
to again rednce the quotations. There are rumors
of sates at 934 c, which cannot be confirmed at this

that heavy market nines sold at 4 Vi;s. l-Vs*. or

<The Board of Education has indorsed
he scheme of permitting the pupils to
ransform the ugly grounds into a pretty
park with flowers, lawns, walks and pos
hibiy a fountain.
Next Monday the City Engineer and his
men will drive the grade stakes and lay

pa^t of the work. The teams necessary

1 romised by local firms, and in a few
" weeks tne High School will be in the cen

pile they surround.
â¢â¢ â ; Since the High School was built the city
been a violator of its own sidewa.k

aids are still there, but now that the
â¢ vacant iot is not to be a pasture ground
-tray goats the Board of Education
will undoubtedly lay legal cement walks.
The girl students are anxious to assist
in the work oi beautifying the grounds,
but they are not yet a'unitasto how to
proceed. Of course they can do a great
Â«leal by encouraging the youthful toilers
with their presence, but the Oakland H Â£h
sciiool girl is capable of doing something
far more practical and less senumental
and it is probable that they will be given
trie opportunity to scour the gardens of
their friends for plants and shrubs which
.will be necessary to complete the plans.

Importnnt Decision.

Ogden handed down a decision to-day in
the case of Mrs. Hannah Wilson against
ex-Sheriff Robert McKillican, wherein he
holds that oral evidence may be produced
to contradict ihe consideration named in
a deed. This, the court said, is upheld by
the statutes ot tiis State, but is at vari
ance with the laws of nearly every other
State in the Union.
The case arose over a loan of $26,000
maae in 1888 by F. W. Fratt of Sacra
mento to H. C. Wilson of Tehama County.
Senator Wilson admitted his inability to
pay, and Fratt brought suit and secured

office, wnen Mrs. Wilson secured an in
junction against him. She died and her
sons followed up the suit.

Miss Ada Little Announced.
Interesting N-ws.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. B âCharles f.
Nott, who assisted Butterworth this sea
son, will probably be Berkeley's football
coacn next year. According to the pres
ent sentiment of those in charge of the
selection of a football institution, no
special Eastern coach will be secured,
the services of Nott, who is an instructor
In botany, being obtainable and regarded
as sufficient.
The choice was virtually announced by
Professor Edwards at a meeting of the
Associated Students this alternoon. The
mee.ine was called for the pumose of dis
cussing the proposition to piace footbali
mutters in the hands of an executive com
mittee consisting of the coach, the di
rector of physical culture and an alum
nus.
After general discussion the students
decided upon next Thursday a- a day for
vo.inu on the proposed appointment of a
committee. If the proposition should
be carried an executive committee will at
once be appointed which will have full
charge of tue football season to end with
Thanksgiving, 1897.
Two members of the committee are
practically certain. They are Professor
Magee, the director of physical culture,
and the coach, >"ott. The alumnus who
is to be the third committee man is prob
ably Colonel Ea wards. Other men
spoken of for the place are Oscar Taylor
and L. E. Hunt.
For the < aniol Medal.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. B.â The inter
cullegiate debate for the Carnot medal
will be held on the second Friday evening
in February, at Stanford University, upon
the foliowing subject: "Is the French
system of superior education more con
due.ve to the welfare of the State than
would be a like system to that of the
U.iited States?"
The debate will be held at Palo Alto in
accordance with the expressed wish of the
Stanford men. They claim that Berkeley
has hau too much of an advantage because
of the numerous debates between the two
universities which liave been held in
Brkeley and in ba:i Francisco where the
sympathy of the audiences lay largely
with the University of California. No
sides or speakers have yot been c:iosen.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
THIS ALTRURIA
HAS NOT FAILED
Winters Island Folks Send
Out a Glowing
Report.
Directors to Visit the Settlement
and Lay Plans for the Com
ing Year.
Only Thirteen Vacancies Ont of a
Brotherhood Limited to Oae
Hundred.
Oakl and Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 8. j
Although the Altrurta which was
originated by Rev. E. B. Payne of
Berkeley proved a failure the co-opera
tive brotherhood of Winters Island is de
veloping into a marked success. The
principles on which both were run are
practically the same.
Reports have just been received from
the island by F. D. Hopkins, the cashier
of Wells, Fareo & Co., who is also secre
tary of the brotherhood, giving very en
couraging details of the progress of the
venture. Although the brotherhood is
limited to 100 members there are at the
present time only thirteen shares that
have not been taken up.
During the past year much has been
learned and some failures have been
made with certain crops, bat the ex
perience gained, it is stated, will tend
toward making the coming year far more
success ml.
In a short time the directors will visit
and inspect the island in a body and will
consult with the members who are there
and who know all about the land and its
capability. At present the difficulty is
that the families located there are not
sufficiently familiar with the cultivation
of their soil and the raising of the product
which it is best fitted to produce. T c
work for the year 1897 will be mapped out
at the next meeting of the board, which
has its headquarters in this City.
E. Kelsey, the treasurer, report! the fol
lowing suggestions, which will be neces
sary to insure success:
As large an acieage as possible of berries
will be planted, ns they are permanent
and profitable. On account of the expense
of transportation between the island and
San Francisco it is not profitable to raise
hay, so only enough oat hay is grown to
satisfy the demands of the island resi
dents.
One of the most profitable products of
the island is buckwheat, and a large acre
age wiil be sown during the coming year.
It has been found that all kinds of vege
tables and alfalfa can flourish on the re
claimed land, and on these products the
brotherhood bases its hope for the coming
year.
A. G. Gregg, editor of the island paper
who has just paid a visit to the island, re
ports in glowing terms the cond tion of
every branch of work that has been un
dertaken. A large portion of the work
consists in diggine ditches and building
dam*, and experiment has proved that
the. peat taken out of the ditches make>>
excellent fuel, and all that is taken from
the interior ditches is used for that pur
pose. The orchard trees are growing well
and another sunnier will make a very
noticeable change in tho general appear
ance of the i&land. The residents have
alreaay undertaken the business of can
ning goods, and so iar as they have gone,
it has been successful.
Everything is dune on tVie co-operative
principle, and no man is better than his
brother, although the necessary officials
to preserve discipline and prevent fac
tional stn:e are maintained.
Since its organization, tne brotherhood
has been in existence three years and a
half, and this, it is claimed, is a longer
period of success than has been enjoyed
by any similar fraternity.
WILL ROAM NO MORE,
Mother Quinn, a Character
Upon Alameda Streets,
Found Dead.
Manager Rank Denies That the Ala
meda Line Will Enter the
Realty Syndicate.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. B.â Mrs. Cather
ine Quinn, a miserably poor and decrepid
old woman of more than 86 years or age,
and familiarly known to thousands of
this city as "Mother" Quinn, is at last be
yond the iils and woes of this world of
sorrow. Her body was found in Brick
yard Slougi;, beyond the tidal canal,
-where it crosses High street. The remains
were first discovered by some school
children, and soon a hundred or more
urchins were cazing upon the repulsive
scene. Sue was clad in the rags that bave
covered her for years past and was taken
for a man at first owing to the growtu of
hair upon her cnin.
S. S. Austin, W. Lambert and Mr. Kim
ball were attracted to the Bpot by the
gathering of children. Aa soon as they
discovered the cause Mr. Austin notified
the Coroner, and a deputy took the re
mains to the morgue in Oakland. It is
supposed that in Tier senility she wan
dered from her home, 1912 Everett street,
last evening and roamed about until an
early hour this morning, when she sauk
or fell exhausted.in the slough to drown.
"Mother" Quinn had resided here nearly
a quarter ola century, being a native of
Ireland. She had property valued at
$1600, but it was mortgaged for $800, Her
only child, a daughter past 60, was her
companion. The latter had been in a
lunatic asylum on two < cessions, and the
mother was dependent upon charity. The
Supervisors refused her a:d because she
owned property, but the Woman's Ex
chdkge had been helping her of late.

When a ked about the report that that
road would enter the new combine he
said: "There is nothing at all in the re
port. Some of those owning stock in the

MISS YAW HAS ARRIVED.

OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. B.â Mis3 Helen
Beach Yaw and her concert company ar
rived from Los Angeles this evening and
will open their season at the Macdonough
on Thursday evening.
Miss Yaw has been considerably amused
of late by the announcement that she has
been recently married. "I can't think
where tne siily story started," she said.
"I take great pleasure in stating that I
am not married and have no intention of
being."
Miss Yaw says that her voice i 3 in per

VAN AIKEN'S STORY.
The Police Kelieve That He Was Not
Robbed, but Attempted to Com
mit Miicidr.
Detectives Egan and Silvey have been
investigating the alleged robbery and at
tempt to murder of John Van Aiken on
Green-Btreet wharf Monday night and
have almost reached the conclusion that
John is a romancer.
So far as their investigation goes they
have reason to believe that he cut his own
throat in a fit of despondency and jumped
into the water.
Monday night Policeman P. Fleming
found a knife and a razor covered with
blood on the wharf. Van Aikcn denied to
Egan and Silvey that be carried a knife,
but the one found on the wharf was iden
tified as Van Aiken 's yesterday afternoon
by a man who worKed with him in the
Emporium restaurant.
The detectives found in his room at 675
Mission street a razor strop, but no razor,
and they feel satisfied that the bloody ra
zor belongs also to him.
Van Aiken's collar and necktie were
found in his coat pocket without any
trace of blood on them and the presump
tion is that he took them off before cut
ting hi 3 throat. He met with an accident
recently and Â«ince then he has been in a
despondent mood.
There are other things, which all lead
to the conviction that Van Aiken was not
robbea and that the story ol the two foot
pads was simply trumped up. He was
taken to the City and Couuty Hoiuital
yesterday afternoon.

JUROR ROBERTSON
LEAVES THE PANEL
He Is Excused for the
Term by Judge Dain
gerfield.
Had Serve! Faithfully and Was
Appreciated by the
Court.
No Criticism Was Passed on His
Conduct and He Acted Right in
the Wiliiams Trial.
J. Donald Robertson, a juror in the case
of ThomaÃ S. Williams Jr., who was
charged with libeling Judge Hebbard.made
application to be excused from the panel
for the remainder ot the term, and his
request was granted by Judge Dainger
field yesterday.
At the opening of court Mr. Robertson
arose irom his seat among the other
veniremen ami said that he deemed it his
duty and privilege to apply for release
from further service on the jury. He
stated that he was moved to take this
action by the fact that his action in main
taining his convictions of right had
brought down upon him the aspersions of
some of the newspapers. "While these
reflections were unjust in the extreme, he
felt that it would be better for him~to re
tire from the jury list at this time.
Judge DaingerfielJ replied that Mr.
Robertson had served faithfully as. a juror,
and in recognition of that service was en
titled to the relief for which he a-ked on
his own account and on the account of the
record of his services. The court would
not, however, take into account the
attacks of newspapers in excusing iurors.
That would not be recognized as a good
or sufficient excuse.
Mr. Robertson explained further that
his business had in some respects been
neglected because he wished to faithfully
perform hisduties as a citizen, and though
service en the jury panel was as distaste
ful to him as to other men of business,
yet he had been wiiung to bear the burdens
of citizenship to the extent oi his ability.
It was ascertained that the period for
which Mr. Robertson was boosei to serve
would expire next Monday, and thereupon
Judge Daingertieid directed that he be
released from the panel and excused from
attendance during the present term with
due aud full acquittance and with the
thanks of the court.
One of the evening papers having inti
mated thai Judge Daingerfielii had ex
pressed gratification because of Mr. Rob
ertson's withdrawal from the panel the
Judge was asked if he wished to oe under
stood in that way.
"Certainly not," said Judge Dainger
field. "I did not say or intimate anvtning
of the kind. Mr. Robertson was entitled
to beexcused. and l readily granted his
request."
"Was there anything in your remarks
that was intended as a renVcsion on Mr.
Robert son because of his action as a juror
in the Williams case?"
"Not in the least. He is not subject to
criticism for exorcising his constitutional
rig M according to â  lie dictates of his rea
son and hi 9 conscenice. If that could be

So the records of the court and the ex
pressions of Judge Daingerfield show that
Mr. Robertson retires from tue panel on a
ievei with any other juror who has per
formed his uaty and is excused from
further service as a mark of the court's
appreciation and esteem.

JUST A FEW
MORE FAVORITES
The Talent Cashed on Four
More Winning Choices
at Ingleside.
Preston Barely Beat Imp. Santa j
Bella Out in a Fierce
Drive.
i
i
Eddie Jones Got Palomacita Hem: a ;
Nose Before CollinsâCash Day !
Fell Into a Soft Spot
There were some decidedly top-heavy ;
choices starting in the different events at
I::g!eside yesterday, and unfortunately ;
for the Inokmaking fraternity they all |
won, and heavily .backed at that. Pat
Dunne's Preston had a close call from de- :
feat, bat Mount McGregor and Cash Day i
virtually rolled in. Captain Skidmore !
and Greyhurst were the only outsiders to
save the ring from complete annihilation,
the latter scampering in ahead of his field |
at the juicy price of 15 to 1.
Another charming day for racing pur- j
poses drew fully as large a crowd to the i
tract as on the opening day of the week.
There were no accidents of any sort and j
the talent left for home with money ,to !
purchase Government bonds.
For some reason, among tne fifteen
starters in the first race over a distance of |
seven furlongs, imp. Friar was picked as ;
aboat due to land a purse and carried !
most of the coin bet. He ran second to i
Captain Skidmore to the stretch and then
quit. The captain at odds of 5 to 1 won j
very handily from McFarlane in 1:30%. j
Little Bob coming fast at the end was a I
fair third.
The milo selling affair for two-year- j
olds proved a stumbling blocK for players.
.Lincoln 11, with 101 pounds in the saddle, |
carried some big commissions at odds of ;
6to 5, but could finish, no better than
tbird. Grey hurst, with young Slaughter]
in the snddie, stepped out in the. lead and j
was never headed. finiÂ«hin2 three lengths '
before Osric II in I:4l}^. The winner was
15 ;o 1 at post time.
For once Preston captured a race with
nothing up his sleeve. The brown
sprinter was made a 3 to 5 choice over his !
company in the third event at six fur- j
Jongs, although Ciesarian had almost as j
many friends who supported him at 2 to j
2^tol. The favorite got the decision, !
though imp. Santa BelJa came very close '
to defeating him. Caesarian and the rank |
outsider, Trappean, were the leaders to j
the stretch, where Martin, on Preston, f
brought his mount up on the outside, ;
hooking up with the first-named horse. ;
The pair indulged in a hot drive to the |
wire, and while so engaged Coadv sneaked !
up on the inside witn Santa Bella and ,
looked to have reached the tape first, but j
Preston gained the verdict. Caesarian
wns a bang up third.
With Salvable scratched out of the next
event, at six iurlongs, Mount McGregor ;
hud only to gallop to take the purse from !
Miss Ross, starting a prohibitive 1 to 6
favorite.
It looked most dubious at one time for â 
the 6to 1 choice Palomacita during the i
progress of the mile and a sixteenth run, i
Cut off on the backs:retch and pocketed, ,;
Eddie Jones got out of this predicament f
and outfinishing T. Murphy on Collins, j
won by a nose in I:49}Â£. Hermanita was
third.
The old stake horse, Cash Day, struck
what could truthfully be termed a "tapi- j
oca" in the seven-furlong dash for non- j
winners in 1&)6. Opening in the betting j
at 1 to 2, the price was speedily rubbed to j
Ito 3. He sailed to the front on t_e beck
siretch and fairly romped in ahead of I
Lovdal, the second choice. Midas finished
a distant third.

This is "ladies' day" again at InglesHe,

terday. He reports a very profitable ar
gument with the Eastern pencilers during
the past summer.
There were a number of very close fin
ishes yesterday, but Judees Rees and
Wilson* appeared to be fully capable of
wrestling with them.
Many did not like the ride J. Gardiner
furnished on the back of Arrezzo. There
is a possibility that the public has the bay
son of Arctino overestimated, especially
when it comes to eroing a distance.
Bill Murry held Collins at the post with
one hand and a stopwatch with the other.
Once the portly resident of Sacramento
got within dangerous proximity to the
heels of Hasard t and had that welding sud
denly taken the idea in his head to feel
coltish anil kick a bit, some jeweler would
have been busy for six weeks repairing a
dilapidated-looking chronometer.
From the showing of speed in the mile
and a sixteenth run it is quite evident
that Palmerston runs better with light
weight on his back.
In a letter 10 a friend in this (Jity the
Chicago bookmaker, Sam Summerfieid,
<ays he may change his mind and come
out this way ere long. He had been in
formed the game was bad. Possibly the
gentleman who sent this information did
not have oil enough left to keep his lamp
burning.
Judging from* her showing in the last
event old Geraldine has tired of the toils
and tribulations of the turf and longs for
a life of ea>e and luxury far from the
sound of the saddling gong and the as
sistant starter's lash. First over the line
in many a hard fought struggle, both East
and West, she does not deserve being sent
to the post to have the ilust kicked in her
face by "dogs" that in the past could not
make her gallop.

A PRESIDENT'S PARDON.
Cleveland Sets Free One of l>ick Wil
liams' Chinese Friends.
Dong Sun, the Chinese who got himself
into jail for interfering in the case of Dick
William?, the convicted customs inter
preter, has been pardoned by President
Cleveland, and he was released from the
County Jail yesterday. Dong has been in
the County Jail a little over three months,
and during that time he has no doubt
learned that it is safer to keep his month
shut than to get mixed up with thÂ« Fed
eral courts.
When the Dick Williams case was be
fore United States District Judge Mor
row Donp Tang, a nephew of Dong Snn,
was a witness for the Government, and
he gave his testimony upon one occasion
in tne forenoon. When he went to dinner
his uncle told him that the best thing for
him to do was to keep oui of the case
ahopetner and not to return to testify in
the afternoon. In fact he intimidated his
brother's son so badly that the witness
stayed away from court. When Judge
Morrow learned of the situation he sen
tenced Donsr Sun to serve six months'
imprisonment in the County Jail, begin
ning on August 20.
The order for the man's release was by
telegraph, the message being sent by
United States Attornpv-General Harmon.

EQUINE BEAUTY
AT THE PAVILION
With a Hurrah the Great
Horse Show Opens
To- Day.
SOME FAMOUS ENTRIES
All the Best Seats for the Season
Secured by Eager
Admirers.
FEATURES CF THE OPENING.
Governor Budd and Other Celebrities
to Be Present at the Inaugural
Luncheon.
The horse show "has come" and brought
with it all that the term implies. The
town has had two annual borse shows,
and as the second was better than the
first the int?rested ones are now confident
that the third will excel the second.
All was activity at the Pavilion yester
day. The stalls were filled with clean,
sweet-smelling straw and the floor in the
vicinity covered with sawdust. The ring
has been laid out just as it was before, even
the boxes and seats having the same ar
rangement.
Ti;e whole building is filled with the
pungent odor of the tanbark track and
the fashionable ones who turn out to view
the equine beauties to-day will be able to
dose their eyes and imagine themselves
beneath the waving boughs of a Calaveras
or Menaocino forest.
There are over 460 entries this year.
Tn is is nearly the same as last season, but
Major Rathbone. the vice-president of The
association, thinks the entries better dis
tributed than before.
The entries among the trotters are quite
numerous. Prominent exhibitors are W.
8. Hobart, J. B. Haggin, F. H. Burke of
Kan Jose, John F. Boyd of Oakwood Park,
Pierce Brothers, William H. Vigoet of
Lawrence, and the Agnew BtocÂ£ farm.
Hobart is entered as exhibitor in almost
every class. His particular forte lies in
the four-in-hands, tandems and driving
horjes. Prominent roadster exhibitors
are A. B. Spreckels, W. S. Hobart. Water
house, John Parrott, F. H. BurJte and the
Aenew stock farm.
Lovers of draft horses with their
massive physiques and full, arching necKs
â¢will be disappointed this yÂ«ar. W. F.
Laumeister has a small exhibit of these
animals and Diet ami Dave will represent
Golden Gate Park. Pierce Brothers have
some handsome Clydesdales on exhibi
tion, while Frank E. Lane of Stockton and
J. Blondin of Petal u ma have a few entries
of Percherons aud Normans.
Saddle-horse entries are also numerous.
Nearly all the large exnibitors have sev
eral. Some have even sent their private
animals.
Among hackneys are Green's Rufus and
Paranon. Henry* J. Crocker, president of
the Pacitic Coast Horse irhow Association,
has some handsome carriage horses at the
show. Among them are Edward, Edgar,
Dorothy. Prince, Fred and Lena. He has
aisfi a wefÂ» pony, Bessie.
W. S. Hobart, G. A. Pope, John Parrott,
Charles A. Baldwin, F. H. Burke and the
Agnew niock farm will be the principal ex
hibitors of horses In harness.
Then there is the class of delivery- J
wagon horses, singly and in pairs. The I
largest exhibitors in this line are Siebe & '
Green, Goldberg & Bowen, the Morton
.Special Delivery, J. C. Irvine & Co. and
the Mount Shasta Mineral Spring Com
pany.
Crocker, Baldwin and Hobart are the ]
only exhibitors of pony tandem?, and !
they, together with G. A. Newhall and
Joseph D. Grant, form the four-in-hand
exhibitors.
The Palo Alto stock farm will make no j
exhibit this year. Corbett will also be j
missed. W. 08. McDonough has his
two-year-old colt, Rosalbra, entered
among the thoroughbreds. Other exhib
itors of thorough hr^ds are A. B. Spreck
els. Ed Corrignn, J. N. Burse of San Jose,
and Burns <fc Waterhouse.
The show will open at 9 a. m., and from
that hour till 10 o'clock the horses may be j
led or ridden in the ring under the eye of !
the ringmaster. This will be the exercise j
hour. No classes will go on to be judged, !
however, this morning.
From 10 till 11 o'clock the horses will be
driven in the ring, and from 11 till 11:30
tandems and four-in-hands will nave a
chance to shine.
From 11:30 to 12:30 the ring will be kept I
cleared for jumpers. Then comes recess !
and la <Â»r on the inaugur.il luncheon.
At 2 p. m. Islington, full brother of the !

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1896.
THE SCANDAL AT
THE HOSPITAL,
Board of Health Begins a
Star- Chamber Investi
gation.
Mrs. Patten's Story Strength
ened by the Resident Phy
sician's Testimony.
Dr. Luiiey Dsnies That He Wants to
Become Superintendentâ Too Much
Like HoteNEeeping.
Another of those secret investigations
on which the Board of Health always falls
back when a more than usually spicy scan
dal appears in any of the institutions un
der its c'narge has been begun.
Nominally t^he conduct of a number of
nurses and internes of the City and County
Hospital is under scrutiny, but the real
fact is that Superintendent Stahle is being
investigated as to his fitness to head the
institution inasmuch as the acts com
plained of took place under his notice or
are supposed to have done so.
As in the case when it desired to rid
itself of Superintendent Weaver of the
Almshouae, the Hospital Committee, that
is in charge of the matter, will probably
make public only such evidence as suits
its purpose. The frolics of the nurses and
internes and what preceded tiie ride of
one of the former on the shoulder of one
of the latter tin and down the corridors
while patients were dying for want of at
tention in some of the wards will proba
bly not be told in public print.
Other matters will, however, and it is
expected that Stahie's head will fall into
the basket before the investigation has
been finished to the satisfaction of the
medicos.
John T. Dare appeared before the meet
ing of the Board of Health yesterday as
the attorney of Miss Baker. Miss Dolan
and Mrs. Hutcninson, nurses, who were
suspended for complicity in the revel that
started the scandal ai the hospital.
He stated tnat they desired au open
investigation and complained of the sum
mary manner in which they had been re
lieved of their duties without a chance to
explain. Mr. Dare claimed that the board
was working a hardship on the nurses, as
they were not able, until the matter was
cleared up, to obtain work elsewhere.
Dr. Hart brusqueiy informed the at
torney that the investigation was in the
hands of the Hospital Committee and t,.at
the matt-r would be attended to.
Miss Patton, the head nurse, has the
corroboration of Dr. Dudley in her story
of the escapade of the night of November
'27, which seems to form only a climax to
the free and easy conduct of internes anil
nurses. Miss Patton says that when she
came into the corridor on the night in
question she was not wearing her uniform,
havinp hastily put on what came to hand.
Dr. Gunn did not recognize her, and so
kept on with his play. He was at the
moment chasing a nurse down the hall.
He overtook her and a struggle ensued, be
trying, as Miss Palton supposed, to kiss
the nurse. Ho finally picked her up and
carried her, her feet in the air and her
heaa down, nearly the full length of the
corridor lo where she, Miss Patton, still
unrecognized, stood. There, in front of
her, he dropped the unfortunate nurse.
"I immediately took that nurse in hand
and led her up to Dr. Dudley's room," said
Miss Patton. "He was in charge, Super
in'endeut Stahle being absent. I told Dr.
Dudley exactly what had taken place in
presence of the nurse, and she admitted
it all.
"Dr. Stahle then said that he would
suspend the nurses, but that 'these young
uoctor3 have to go out into the world and
make their way alter a while and they
must be protected. 1 To this I indignantly
reaised to assent. I declared that if any
body was to be protected the nurses had
as much claim as the doctors. So I went
and reported the whole thing to the
board.
"Being responsible for the work done in
the wards I wish to put a stop to all tbis
social relationship that obtains between
the internes and nurses. Such things
would not be tolerated in any private non
pital nor in any proper training school. It
should be stopped."
for herself Miss Patton took occasion
to emphatically deny that she was ever
suspended on any charge of familinrity
with an interne. She was suspended, she
says, but it was because of a slight differ
ence between herself and Superintendent
Titus. In evidence she produced this note
from Dr. Titus:
December 7, 1896.
Miss Mary Palton, Principal of Training-school,
City and County Hospital: Dear Madamâ You
are Â»t liberty to state on my authority that
the cause for whicn you was suspended oy me
when superintendent of that institution was
not familiarity wlih any of the internes, or
auy other person, but something entirely dif
ferent, and concerned your official relations
with the superintendent only. Yours truly,
F. H. Titus, M.D.
Dr. F. W. Dudley, the resident physi
cian of the hospital, corroborates the
statement of <Miss Patton in so far as her
report to him in the presence of the nurse
is concerned. He declares that the nurse
assented to all that was said and that he
believes the story as given above.
"As to the story of my being desirous to
secure the office of superintendent, as pub
lished in the Examiner of this morning,"
said Dr. Dudley, "it is a silly fake, a false
hood out ol whole cloth. I have no desire
for the Buperintendency and would not
accept it if it was offered to me.
"I am much better pleased with my
present position, S3 it is a medical one. I
wish to progress in my profession ant
therefore could not ufford to lake the po
sition. I look upon the superintendency
as more in the line of a hotel-keeper. I
have no ambition to spend mv time civinc
receipts for potatoes and milk ana bread.
No, there is nothing of truth in that
story."
Dr. John F. Morse is the one membor of
the Board of Health that has from the
first been opposed to the attachment of a
training school for nurses to the City and
County Hospital, the system that seems
to be entireiy responsible for the current
scandal. He has expressed his views be
fore not only the Board of Health but the
Board of Supervisors and the Grand Jury,
so they are pretty well known. He thinks
this City is rich enough to pay for nurses
that are already trained ; that they should
be properly paid, and, being so, tnat they
should then be required to do their work
properly.
He thinks, further, that the hospital
should be taken out of politics and placed
under the care of what might be called a
Board of Public Charities, with the Mayor
at its head. Under these reforms, witn
strong discipline coupled with humanita
rian methods, Dr. Morse thinks the never
lacking scandal (hat has flaunted over the
hospital until good citizens are ashamed
of tne institution would be quieted for
ever.
A MAID'S FATAL JUMP.
Cecelia Robb Makes a Wild leap While
Insane.
Cecelia Robb, a maid employed by Mrs.
Mary Hort of the Richelieu Hotel on Van
Ness avenue, jumped from a three-story
window at midnight las-t night and sus
tained injuries from which she will die.
The girl had been ill for some days
and was suffering from religious mania.
The result of the fall was broken legs and
arms and a broken back. There is no
possibability of her survival.
The unfortunate victim of mania lay
unconscious for some time, after which
she began to scream and some men pass
ing heard her, notified the hotel and called
! for medical assistance.
