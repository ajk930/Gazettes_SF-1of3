THE FALSEHOOD DENOUNCED BY
REPUTABLE WITNESSES.
Charles L Fair and His Attorney, George A.
Knight, Repudiate an Alleged Interview
Defaming "The Call's" Proprietor.
The Examiner yesterday morning contained an article sensationally beaded and
leaded to the effect that Charles M. Shortridge last year demanded of Charles L. Fair
the loan of $300,000 for himseif and the employment of the firm of Delmas & Short
ridge as Mr. Fair's attorneys in consideration of the support of The Call in his litiga
tion to recover his share of his father's estate.
In the article itself and in a leaded editorial in the same issue Charles M. Short
ridge is termed a blackmailer, an.i the charge is directly and unmistakably made that
Mr. Shortridse l>ad attempted to blackmail Mr. Fair.
Those who knovr the Examiner intimately; those who have been approached by
Long Green Lawrence with a demand for hush money; those who have beard the evil
reputation of that indecent sheet discussed in the highways and byways of the State,
need not be told that the article in the Examiner is a malignant falsehood from be
ginning to end.
The evidence is at hand. All the parties interested â gentlemen of prominence, of
â¢respectability, of business standing and of unquestioned integrity â unite in declaring
that the Examiner has deliberately, wantonly and knowingly and with malice falsely
' de/nined the character of -Mr. Shortridge.
Charles L. Fair and George A. Knight deny that they made the statements which
the Examiner says they made. They deny also that any attempt at blackmail was
made or even the suggestion of it, and corroborate Mr. Shortridge's version of the
affair.
| There is one little thread of truth in the Examiner story. It is that Mr. Short
ridge did apply for a loan of $300,000 or thereabouts to Cnarles L. Fair; but the loan
was not for himself; it was for the Shasta Lumber Company.
Now for the iacts:
After Mr. Shortridge became proprietor of The Call in 1895 he had a talk with
. Hon. B. D. Murphy and other prominent gentlemen in San Jose. Mr. Murphy and
the Dank of which he was an official were interested in the Shasta Lumber Company.
The company desired a loan lor the pupose of making some betterments, and Mr.
Murphy spoke t> Mr. ShortridÂ«Â» about the matter. The loan required was a large
one, being $300,000 or $400,000, and Mr. Sbortndge promised Mr. Murphy that he
would do what he could to obtain the loan for the company. Tne attorney for the
bank drew up a prospectus setting forth the assets of the company, which were gih
edged ana more than ample to >ecure the lender.
Mr. Shortridge inquired of Charles L. Fair whether he had that sum of money to
.: Joan to the Shasta Lumber Company ana offered the prospectus for that gentleman's
examination. Mr. Fair replied that the affairs of his lather's estate were in such an
. unsettled condition that he had no money to Joan. Mr. Shortridge thereupon pro
ceeded to the Mutual Savings Bank on Post street and there applied for the loan.
Mr. Shortridge called at the office of Charles L. Fair yesterday morninjr. He
found George A. Knight, Mr. Fair's attorney, there. Mr. Knight expressed his sur
prise on rinding that his name had been dragged into the matter, and denied ever
having made any remarks imputed to him by the Examiner. Mr. Fair not being
'present an appointment was made for a meeting with him at 1 o'clock, and at that
hour, in the presence of John E. Richards and George A. Knight, Mr. Fair made the
following statement:
STATEMENT OF CHARLES 1,. FAIR.
I was very much surprised and distressed this morning to find that my name
had been dragged into a newspaper controversy. I had an interview with Mr.
Khortrldge in the early part of the year 1895, with reference to a loan of about
,â¢ "8 300,000 to some one nho/n Mr. bhortridge represented, bat whose name I cannot
now recall.
The facts regarding the affair are as follows: I was passing through the grill
. room oT the Palace Hotel odd day about noon when I saw Mr. Charles M. Short
ridge and Mr. B. I). Murphy of San Jose flitting at lunch together. Presently
Mr. Shortridge came over to where I was standing and said that he had a very
important business proposition to submit to me, and inquired when and where
-we could have an interview. I told him that I would be over at the office of my
attorney, Mr. Knight, at 1 o'clock, and would be pleased to see him there.
At that hour Mr. Shortridge came over to Mr. Knight's office. We met in the
â outer room, und 1 do not recall whether any one else waÂ« present or not. Mr.
Shortridge stated that the business proDosition which he wished to lay before
me was an application for a loan of 9300,000, or thereabouts. He inquired if I
had that amount to loan. I told him that I had no money to loan, as I had not
received as yet any portion of my share of my father's estate, and that there
fore, there was no use in going into the proposition or considering the matter
of security.
That terminated the conversation so far as it related to the loan. I
did not understand for whom Sir. Shortridge desired the loan. After
that portion of our interview was over and we were about to separate
the matter of my being concerned in a big lawsuit was mentioned by
Â«>ne or the other of nr, and incidentally, I don't rrmember just how it came
about, Mr. Shortrlrtge undertook to say spme kind things of Mr. Delmas, who
was the partner of his brother, Samuel M. Shortridge. Then we separated, and
1 gave ihe matter no further thought. The conversation did not occupy more
than five minutes altogether, and there was not the slightest suggestion or
intimation cf blackmail on the part of Mr. Shortridge, nor any thought of such
a thing on my part.
I have never intended to Intimate in any iuteiview upon the subject that
Mr. Shortridge had any such idea. The relations between Mr. Sbortridge and
â ' myself have always been of the most friendly nature, and are so still.
STATEMINT' OF GEORGE A. KNIGHT.
George A. Knight, who was present at the interview, said when seen later in
â¢ the day:
" 1 see that my rame has been uÂ»ed in connection with this newspaper con
troversy and I desire to say that Chaile* M. Shortridge never, at any time or
place, Â«alked with me about the Fair estate, or ever suggested in any way the
: enlistment of 'Ihe Call ' on behalf of myself or my clients in that litigation.
I wan present at the interview, which occurred in my office at 1 o'clock this
svftentooa, between Mr. >hoitr!dge and Mr. Fair, and I heard the statement of
Mi. lair in the course of that interview, and saw the foregoinc statement of Mr
lair after it bad been reduced to writing. It contains the exact language of that
â¢ gentleman with re'erence lo the matter of his former talk with Mr. Shortridge
regarding a proposed loan.
â¢ In all my connection with the matter of the Fair estate I never heard of
Aany proposition on the port of Mr. Shortridge to blackmail Mr. Fair, and I am
*Â«ied that no such effort was ever made."
Hon. B. D. Murphy was se*n at his home in San Jote yesterday, to which he is
confined by vÂ«ry serious illness, and when shown the ariicle in the Examiner of yes
terday morning said: . , w â
"The matter refers to a loan of between $300,C00and $400,000 which Mr. Shortridgn
"presented me in seeking for the Shasta Lumber Company early in the year 1895 and
* during which Mr. Fair was seen by him. I was in terested in that company and it de
fect a loan. Looking about for the money Mr. Fair's name was mentioned as a
The San Francisco Call
proper party to apply to for such a loan. I spoke to Mr. Shortridge regarding the loan '
in San Jose. I instructed our attorney, Mr. Hyland, to draw up a prospectus setting
forth all the property owned by the Shasta Lumber Company. Mr. Hyland rrepared
such a statement and forwarded the same to Mr. Shortrid^e in San Francisco. A few
days thereafter I met Mr. Snortridge in the Palace grillroom. We were taking lunch ,
together when Mr. Fair came into the room. At my suggestion Mr. Shortridge ap- J
proached him and made an engagement for a fnrther interr ; m .After the hour when |
theinterview was to be nod Mr. Shortridge repcted to me tuÂ»t Jbefco&ld ' ; ot inaitea loan
through Mr. Fair as that gentleman was not then in possession cf ihe necessary funds
to make the loan, but that he had other parties in mind to whom be wou'd apply.
Subsequently he reported to me that he could procure the loan on a short term. This
was not satisfactory as the company could not realize upon the property within such
a time to make this loan desirable. In the whole matter Mr. Shortridge was simply
acting as my friend and as the friend of the other gentlemen interested with me in the
Shasta Lumber Company."
J. W. Findlev, vice-president of the Commercial Savings Bnnk of San Jose, was
also seen with reference to this matter, and upon being shown Mr. Murphy's Interview
said: "I was present in the bank when the interview was bad between B. D. Murphy
anc Mr. Shortridge. I heard the instructions given by Mr. Murphy to Mr. Hyland,
who was present, in the matter of preparing a statement of prospectus to show the
nsÂ«ets of the company and forward the same to Mr. Shortridge at His address in San
Francisco. The entire subject of the loan and desirability of the same was gone over
and the great value of the property was thoroughly explained to Mr. Shortndgp. The
names of several gentlemen of sufficient wealth to make so large a loan were con
sidered, and among others the name of Charies L. Fair."
M. H. Hyland, the Superior Judge-elect of Santa Clara County, was next seen,
and stated: "I recall perfectly the matter of the loan which was sought on the part
of its officers early in the year 18Â»5 of between $300,000 and $400,000 for the Shasta
Lumber Company. I was the attorney for the Shasta Lumber Company, and was
present at tho interview between Mr. Murphy and Mr. Shortridge with reference to
the procurement of the loan. I understood that Mr. Shortridge was going to under
take to get the money, and I was instructed by Mr. Murphy to prepare and send to
Mr. Shortridge a prospectus of the property to assist him in making the loan. I
prepared and sent to him by express a full statement of the assets and resources of
the company."
C. B. Hobson of the Mutual Savings Bank, of ban Francisco, when shown the
article in the Fxaminer of yesterday morning, said :
"1 read the article in the Examiner early this morning and at once thont-ht to my
self, this must be the same loan which Mr. Shortridge sought at our bank in the early
part of the year 1895, on behalf of the Shasta Lumber Company. He came to see me
at the bank, and as 1 have known him in San Jose in former years 1 interested myself
in his proposition and introduced him to F. B. Washington, now assistant cashier of
the United States Mint, who at that time was in the bank and had special charge oi
such matters. Mr. Shortridge explained to Mr. Washington, in my presence, the
nature of the business. It was a loan of $300,000 or $400,000 which he was trying to
negotiate for the Shasta Lumber Company, and he had a prospectus showing fully the
assets of the company."
F. B. Washington of the United States Branch Mint in this City was an attache of
the Mutual Savings Bank, at which Mr. Shortridge applied for the loan. Mr. Wash
ington made the foliowinsr statement last night:
"One day Mr. Shortridge spoke to me about a loan. I don't think he mentioned
security particularly, but he gave me to understand, that it was not for himself, but
that he was negotiating it for other parties. The amount was $400,000. He said that
the security wat unlimited; the only question was to find the man who had the
money to loan and he would find all the security wanted.
"I distinctly remember the loan, was not for himself, but for some lumber con
cern. He spoke of lumber-mills and other things. That was while I was in the
Mutual Bank. It is almost sixteen months since 1 loft the bank, and it was shortly
before then that Mr. Shortridge speke to me about tne loan. It was a year and a half
ago, or somewhere about that time. He mentioned B. D. Murphy of San Jose, and
that Mr. Murphy would be a party to the loan in some way or other."
"Did he say anything about The Call? ' Mr. Washington was asked.
"No," replied Mr. Washington; "my understanding was that the whole thing was
an outside enterprise, as he spoke of lumber-mills and lands and so forth. It was not
for himself nor for The Call. The negotiations never got to the footing of mention
ing what it was exactly.
"What caused the negotiation to fall through was that the loan was wanted for a
long time, and the party who had the money would not loan on a long time, and that
was the end of it.
"I don't wish to express an opinion about the article regarding Mr. Shortridge in
this morning's Examiner. I think an unprejudiced man would hardly approve of it."
Mr. Washington was positive in his assertions, and especially so in his tone of
voice when stating that Mr. Shortridge was negotiating the loan for an enterprise on
behalf of a f ri6nd or iriends interested in it, and that The Call was not mentioned at
any time during the interview.

Thorua* I 1".I 1 ". Bayard, the American Minis
ter, arrived here to-day in response to an
invitation to distribute the prizes and de
liver an address to the students at the an
nual commencement of the Technical
School of the Society of Merchant Ven
turers. Mr. Bayaid was invited to be
present at the commencement for the
reason that his great-grandfather on the
maternal side belonged to a distinguished
family of Bristol merchants. This great
grandfather was born in Bristol in 1709
and subsequently settling in Philadelphia
was Mayor of that city, as his father be
fore him had been Mayor in Bristol.
The Society of Ivierchant Venturers is
one of ihe surviving medieval guiids.
Ihe society forms an unbroken link be
tween the Cabots and the present day and
purposes in connection with the people of
Bristol to celebrate In an adequate man
ner next year the four hundredth anniver
sary of the sailing of the Cabot expedition.
As Mi. Bayard is a lineal descendant o:
an ancient Mayor of Bristol and member
of the Merchant Venturers his presence
at the ceremonies was particularly appro
priate. He took luncheon with the Coun
cil of the British Chamber of Commerce
in the boardroom of the Council. Reply
ing to a toast to the health of the guest of
the occasion Mr. Baynrd said that there
was much in the hearts of Americans to- i
day to make them look upon England as
their old home. The ties of blood, he
said, were thicker than water. Continu
ing, lib expressed hope that when he re
turned to America no cloud would ob
struct the vision of any liberal-minded
man. Mr. Bayard then proceeded to make
his usual extreme Anelopbile speech, con
cluding by declaring his belief that the
peace existing between the two English
speaking nations would never be broken.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
THE SWAG READY
FOR LONG GREEN
Judge Sanderson Refuses
to Dirty His Hands
With It.
AGAINST THE STATUTE.
He Decides That the Law Was
Violated by Fitz and
Sharkey.
CANNOT SQUABBLE FOR PURSES
Principals, Seconds, Referee and Club
Officers Slay Be Taken Before
the Grand Jury.
Judge Sanderson yesterday morning de
cided that Fitzsimmons, Sharkey, Wyatt
Earp (who is the bodyguard of "Long
Green" Lawrence), the directors of tho
National Athletic Club. H. I. Kowalsky,
General Barnes and all others connected
with or present ac the $10,000 "glove con
test" bad violated the statute prohiDiting
prize-fighting and were amenable to in
dictment.
The court, therefore, could not inter
fere in the squabble over the purse. So
the injunction was dissolved, and the
complaint of Fitzsimmons against Shar
key was dismissed.
General Barnes began his argument
with the assertion that the complaint was
founded on information and belief and
was too vague to ask summary proceed
ings. The complaint also showed that
the parties had contracted to do some
thing illegal and contrary to pood morals,
and it was not necessary to plead this
fact so long as it came up in the evidence.
The speaker read authorities to show that
if in the progress of the trial either by
admission or proof a fact was developed
which may rentier it necessary to termi
nate a case the court may of its own
motion dismiss the proceedings. The
court would not listen to any claims for
services in things forbidden by law or con
demned by public decancy and morality.
It was officially before the court that
there was a wide difference between a
prize-fight and a glove contest before a
ciub. The case of Seville against the State
was cited. In that case the losing lighter
was knocked, against the rope senseless
and died from the result of the injuries
received from the gloved fists of Seville,
those injuries being a fractured brain and
various bruises on different parts of tne
body. The glove contest took pJace before
a club and was licensed by tne authorities,
but the court decided that it should not
have been licensed and that it was a prize
fight, an assault, and contrary to public
morals.
In the case of an athletic club in New
Orleans the court decided that whether
the contest was called a glove contest or
a boxing match, it was nevertheless a
prize-fight, a breach of the peace end
contrary to good morals, and the license
of the club was rescinded.
It was decided in another case that in a
contest for a purse, with or without
cloves, there wa3 an intention to do an
injury and to break the public peace. The
purpose of the contest was to stop the
opponent by knocking him senseless or
injuring him so as to prevent him from
continuing the fight.
The claim that such Rents were simply
glove contests was equivalent to a claim
that a contest with sharp-pointed foils
and drawing blood was a harmless fencing
niatcn.
In the case before the court Robert Fitz
simmons testified that the tight was for a
purse of $10,000, to be decided in ten
rounds, occupying about 40 minutes, and
that he so injured and discomfited his
adversary that be was nnable to continue
the fight.
Mr. Barnes closed by saying: "If thia
is a case which the officers of the law, the
police, and what they call the Supervi
sors, are willing to wink at, it is tome
tning to which this tribunal should not
close its eyes; and in the name of those
who have witnessed your Honor's judicial
career, in the name of the bar, of every
citizen of this City, I respectfully suggest
that this is one of those cases which the
law does not recognize, and that when
professional pugilists contest for a $10,000
purse the law will not nndertake to re
referee a contest like this, and decide that
one man was a better fighter than the
other and therefore entitled to the purse."
Mr. Freidennch followed with his argu
ment, beginning with the contention that
the court could not go behind the face of
the complaint itself, and therefore could
not regard the testimony taken in the
depositions. Mr. Barnes had tried to
make the court believe, he said, that tho
Supervisors of this City had issued a per
mit for a prize-fight, of wtiich all the spec
tators would be guilty of a misdemeanor.
A physical contest or a boxing match is
not necessarily a fight. The statue of
1893 prohibits prize-rights and not such
harmless diversions as that engaged in by
Messrs. Thomas Shnrkey, late of the high
seas, and Robert, Fuzsimmons, late of
Australia. A prize-fight in violation of
ihe statute meant a iight in which the
contestants tried to injure each other.
Mr. Freidenrich drew attention to the
neglect of Mr. Barnes to make the roint
that this contest was for a prize or a purse.
The fact that a contest is for a reward
dce3 not imply that the contest was il
legal.
Mr. Barnes said he had not raised that
point and that Mr. Freidenrich was wast
ine: his time.
By request of the court Mr. Freidenricn
read the complaint. It recited the passage
of the ordnance granting a special privi
lege to the National Athletic Club to give
a boxing tournament during the month of
December, no contest to exceed ten round-.
The remainder of the complaint consisted
of a recital of charges to the effect that the
referee and others had entered into a con
spiracy to defraud Fitzsimmons by a
wrong decision.
Judge Sanderson said:
"I may as well dispose of this matttt2
now as at any other time. Perhaps it is
proper to say, as a preliminary remark, in
justice to this court of which I am only an
humble member, that this is the iirst time
that this proceeding has appeared in this
court and been challenged by anybody.
lt ln other words, it is the first time that
the right to maintain this action has been
presented to the court. Possibly there is
a prevalent opinion that the court has
been trying the case; but the attorneys,
members of the bar and those who are
acquainted with legal proceedings know
that that is not a fact. I have only sat
here the same as a Judge, as a magistrate,
as a person entitled to give oaths and to
hear testimony, simply for the purpose of
preserving the testimony if it should be
needed. But this is the tirst time that tbe
right has been challenged.
"The injunction was issued here, prob
ably upon the statement that this was a
physical contest which was permitted by
law and given in sanction of law. But
the reading of the amended complaint
here shows, and I suppose it could show
nothing elseâ l suppose the ingenuity of
counsel could not present in^any other or
better light than they haye â they have
called this a boxing match, and that the
Supervisors have licensed a boxing match
in this City. But if the gentlemen will
take the trouble to look into the diction
ary and legal lexicons they will find that
to 'box' is to 'fight' ; that the terms 'boxer'
and 'fighter' are synonymous. And the
consequence is that this exhibition, what
ever it may be called, or the entertain
ment or tournament, as counsel call it, is
a fight which the Supervisors have sought
to legalize.
"In my opinion, under the statute
standing as it does now, they can no more
legalize a fight in this City than they can
legalize a due! ; and this is simply an in
stance here of an attempt undeithe or
dinance to disobey the law. There is no
doubt in my opinion (Mr. Freioer.rich
challenges the right here) that these men
were fighting â must hive been fightingâ
if this complaint is true. For, if they
were boxing they were fighting. They
were committing an offense against the
law, and it is elementary law, and no law
yer will challenge it, that uo court, either
of law or of equity, will take cognizance
of a suit of this character the moment it
is challenged.
"There is no question in my mind that
Ihe parties in this engagement or exhibi
tion or whatever you call itâ the complaint
calls it a boxing contestâ are indiotable
under the law and that the people who
witnessed it are amenable as law-breaKers.
I understand that these exlub tions tre
given, and they are given because the peo
ple and the police wink at them. But no
court will rrcognize any such proceeding.
Ana there is no doubt in my mind that
this injunction should be dissolved, and it
would have been dissolved if the motion
had been made immediately upon the
heels of issuing it, as the court in fact ex
pected.
"The order to dissolve the injunction
will be granted."
General Barnes â How about the motion
to dissolve the complaint?
The court â Yes, the complaint should
be stricken from the files.
Fitz-immons ana Julian were in court
during the session, and appeared rather
tiowncast when the Judge rendered his
decision. Sharkey, Earp and "Long
Green" Lawrence did not appear. The.
pur3e id tied up by attachments against
Sharkey, and, after the lawyers, trainers
and the rest get their share of it, there
will be but very little left for the Sharkey
man.
DAN MILLER IN THE JOB.
Wyatt Earp's Bosom Friend Falls
in With " Long Green" Lawrence.
Robert Fitzsimmon3 is not crestfallen.
The news that J. J. Corbett has signed
with Dan A. Stuart to fight him to a tin
ish on March 17 next has reached him,
and he declares that it fully compensates
for the wrongful decii-ien "Long Green"
Lawrence's man Earp gave, and which
robbed him of $10,000. Fitzsimmons will
leave here in a few days, but he requests
ibat the following statement be published
in The Call before he goes:
I desire to extend to the many kind n.nd
sympathetic friends that I have made in San
Francisco my siucerest thank? for tneir words
of Iciudly cheer durii'g my effurt made in the
court in ihe vain endeavor to recover the
$10,000 which, though honestly won t>y me,
was as dishonestly taken from me by the foul
est conspiracy ever perpetrated in the annals
of pugilism. I was induced to commence the
suit in the bciief that the issue of iraud
which I charge would bo fairly and squarely
met, and I was encouraged in that belief wiien
General Harnes openly slated in court that
he wanted the doors of investigation thrown
wide open, and wanted this case determined
upon justice alone. Finding that the justice
of the case was with me and that I had fully
estaoiished the fraud which I charged had
been perDetrated, he sought refuge in tne
weakness of the lew to give me my just rights,
and lhoved a dismissal of the case on the
ground that the contest was nothing but a
prize-fight and that the court was, therefore,
powerless to relieve. The utter hopelessness
of the defense in this case was maniiest when
resort had to be made to a motion of this
character, asking for a decision wnich might
involve the liberty of the defendant as well
as all those conspiring with them.
lam pleased that the public knows all the
facts ;n the case, and I am willing to stacd or
fall by their judgment. Fully realizing the
great injustice done me, and &>so done to
every fair-mined citizen by the parties to this
foul conspiracy, I still have faith in the belief
that there are honest referees yet to be found
in San Francisco, and I announce myself as
ready to make any match with any one whom
1 have no#alrtady defeated, making, however,
the exception in. favor of Shurkey, whom I am
willing to meet at bis pleasure.
In conclusion, I would assert that I have
always been an enemy of foul blows and
ioul methods, aud that feeling 1 hope will
continue with me so long as I shall continue
to be proud of the honest and true Iriends
that I have made during my Btay in San
Francisco. Yours sincerely.
Bob Fitzsimmons.
Colonel Kowalsky and Martin Julian
stated last night that the decision of
Judge Sanderson ended tbe matter with
them 30 far as the civil proceedings went,
but that they would prosecute criminal}'
some of the people who engaged in the
Sharkey-"Long Green" conspiracy to steal
$10,000.
"We have evidence to prove that Wyatt
Earp was first selected by Danny Miller,
his bosom friend, as the" proper" man to
referee the fight," they said. "Milier is
also Lynch' s friend, and therefore Earp
was acceptable to Lynch. All that was
needed then was to get Gibbs of the Na
tional Athletic Club to propose Earp to
have him accepted. Lynch refusing all
other referees and the selection being in
the hands of the club, all Gibbs required
to put Earp in tbe position of referee was
his indorsement by a newspaper.
"Long Green" Lawrence, whose body
guard Wyatt Earp has been for sonic
nionths, was anxious to see his gun-fighter
in anotner position where he could do
him the most good, and he readily no
tified Gibbs that Wyatt Earp and only
Wvatt Earp must be selected.
The job was then all but consummated.
The "foul" decision did the rest.
The numerous garnishments against
the money which Juuge Sanderson has
allowed to Sbarkey, keeps about $3000 of
it in escrow. The remainder belongs to
Sliarkey, his trainer and General Barnes.
Danny Lynch, who has manipulated the
deal by wiiich Sharkey got the money,
testified in court that there was no portion
of the coin coming to him.
DANGER OF INDICTMENTS.
ThÂ« Civic Federation Likely to
Take Action Against the
Fighters.
Now tbat Judge Sanderson has placed
the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey contest under
the ban of the law by declaring it a prize
fight, pure and simple, and as such pun
ishable by the laws of the State, great
trepidation exists in the boxing world.
There appears to be good reason for this,
because it means tbat not only will the
match under consideration be considered
a prize-tight, but that all contests will re
prohibited in the future. In other words,
legitimate boxing in this City is regarded
as killed for a second time by the greed of
"Long Green" Lawrence, managing editor
of the Examiner, and the fake ruling of
hiÂ« hireling and bodyguard, Wyatt Earp.
There is also a strong probability that
the Civic Federation will brine the details
of the affair before the Grand Jury, and if
possible secure the indictment of both the
fighters and their seconds. I. J. Truman,
president of that body, yesterday spoke as
follows:
"The Civic Federation will hold its next
meeting next Monday evening. As to
whether it will take any decisive action in
the matter I am not at liberty to speak.
"For myself personally I can say this:
The fights that have occurred in San
Francisco during the course of the last
few months are a burning disgrace. The
federation has several times endeavored
to get the officers of the law not to allow
them to proceed, but the apathy of public
opinion has been such that its attempts
have resulted in utter failure.
"I believe the City should take this
affair into its own hands and not leave
the purity bodies bear the brunt of tbe
movement for reform. For my part next
Monday evening I am going to urge the
brineing of the case to the attention of
the Grand Jury with all the powers at my
command."

CAMPAIGN ACCOUNTS AUDITED.
| Republican Executive Committee Pays A/f
Bills and Finds a Comfortable
Balance on Hand.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 17.â Tbe
executive committee of the Republican
i Congressional Campaign Committee, at
I their meeting last night, audited the ac
â  counts of the last campaign and found a
I comfortable balance remaining â an un
usual circumstance. The question cf re
taining permanent headquarters was dis
' cussed and it was felt that while those
\ were not needed at present, it would be
i well to open headquarters next summer
! after the new committee is selected in an
ticipation of the next Congressional eiec
! tion. There is a disinclination on the
! part of the executive committee to permit
Mr. Babcock of Wisconsin to retire from
j the chaiimanship if he should continue as
jamemoerof the committee and an effort
will be made to retain him in his present
position owing to the excellent record
made by him during the last two cam
| paigns. While there was nothing in the
'< informal talk upon the subject which in
! dicated the slightest friction between the
I Congressional and the National commit
i tee, it was felt that the latter's work would
j be largely educational in character and
that the Congressional committee should
continue as formerly the labor of securing
' the election of representatives in the sev
eral States.
BRAZIL IS OBSTINATE.
But May Yet Be Induced to Kegotiate a
Commercial Irt"ty.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 17âNot
withstanding the unofficial announcement
that Brazil will not negotiate a new com
mercial treaty with the United States, the
Rppublican members of the Ways and
Means Committee, who intend that the
reciprocity clause of the new tariff bill
shall bs one of its principal features, be
lieve that Brazil can be brought into the
agreement. It is intended that these
treaties shall be differently constructed
from those that were negotiated under the
law of l; 90 in that they shall be abrogated
only by the consent of both parties and
after a two years' notification from either
side. Their abrogation by the last Con
gress proved, it is claimed, a serious em
barrassment to a number of countries
which, under the original arrangement,
immediately enlarged their output of cer
tain products and found their market in
this country greatly reduced when their
treaties were no longer in force.
It is to guard against this contingency
that the committee will insert the provi
sion making their annulment impossible
on anytning^less than a reasonable rati
fication.
THE TEXAS ALL RIGHT.
1b the Equal if Aot Superior of Any f'es
ael in the Mary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 17âSecre
tary Herbert has issued a very full state
ment as to the condition and seaworthy
qualities of the battle-ship Texas, in
which he states that she b the equal if
not the superior of any vessel in the navy.
In this he is sustained by Charles H.
Cramp and the naval officers who have
been connected with the construction and
navigation of the ship.
The statement says that the accident
which happened recently at the New York
Navy-yard could not nave happened at
see. It happened because part of the in
jection pipe had bten removed for repairs.
The testimony of naval officers wascited
to show that tne Texas is the stiffest and
most easily managed and entirely sea
worthy ship in the service.
SINKING OF THE TEXAS.
Chief : Engineer* found to â Hate Been
IBJS^j Htprehenitibly Careleta.
WASHINGTON, D. C.; Dec. While
the court of inquiry which investigated
the sinking of the Texas on November 4
attached no blame to any one for the
accident, which it found due to a defective
casting in a valve yoke and j the possible
existence or open valves between com
partments. Secretary Herbert,: on ; the
recommendation of â â ? the advocate
general, finds Chief Engineers Moore of
the ship and Farmer of the navy-yard
"reprehensibly careless," and if each "had
not failed in his duty this accident could
not have happened." A mild reprimand
in the form of a copy of these findings has
been stint to the two affected officers.

RESTRICTIONS TO
THE IMMIGRATION
Passage of a Bill to Annul
the Law Now in
Force.
Provisions That Those Who
Seek a Landing Must Read
and Write.
Exceptions, However, Mads in Favor
of Refugees Firm Cuba Who
Flee Frcm Spaniards.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 17.â The
| bill which passed the House last session
and for which a substitute waÃ reported by
the Senate committee to amend the immi
gration laws of the United States occupied
the attention of the Senate during nearly
the whole of to-day's session. The substi
tute was amended in some particulars, the
most notable amendment being one pro
viding that the act shall not apply to
Cuban refugees during the existing
troubles in Cuba, and then it was passed
by a vote of 52 to 10 and a conference
asKed with the House. .The bill as passed,
in addition to those classes excluded un
der existing laws, excludes all persons
over 16 years of age who cannot read and
write the language of their native country
or some other language, but it does not
exclude the wife, child, parent or grand-
I parent of an admissible immigrant not
withstanding their inability to read and
write.
A motion by Hale (R.) of Maine that
when the Senate adjourn to-day it adjourn
! until Monday was agreed to without di
j vision.
The House amendments to the Senate
bill as to the lands of the Pacific railroads
were laid before the Senate, and
| were on motion of Hili (D.) of New York
nonconcured in and a conference asked,
Senators Hill, Platt (R.) of Connecticut
and Clark (K.) of Wyoming being ap
pointed conferees on the part of the Sen
ate.
In presenting a lot of petitions from
Alabama declaring that there was no law
ful State government in that State, Chan
dler (R.) of New Hampshire collided with
Allen in reference to the failure of Allen's
resolution of inquiry on that subject last
session. Chandler assertins that the reso
lution had failed because of some intem
perate remarks of Allen's questioning the
motives of Republican Senators and Allen
denying that, but asserting that he had
had a trave suspicion that the resolution
never would be acted on in pood faith on
I the Republican side of the chamber.
After the passage of two Senate bills on
the calendar (as to accounts of army offi
cers who were graduates of West Point
j Military Academy, and for the relief of
| Major William W. Dyer) the House bill to
! amend the immigration laws was taken
j up.
The amendment was modified so as to
i make the exclusion paragraph read: "All
I ptrsons over ]6 years of ?.<ie who cannot
i read and write the language or their na
j tive country, or some other language; but
' an admissible i"inii^rant over such age of
j 16 may bring in wiih him or send for his
i wife or parent or grandparent or minor
child or grandchild notwithstanding their
inability to read and write."
Morgan (D.) of Alabama moved to
j amend tt,e bill so as tbat it shall not app!y
jto immigrants from Cuba. The demands
! of humanity, he said, were obvious in re
lation to Cuba. Tne United States coull
not afford to send back a Cuban to the
! merciless grasp of the men from whom he
I had escaped. The exception, he argued,
could be made without interfering with
the general clause in treaties as to "the
most favored nations."
Hoar (D.) of Massachusetts suggested
that the belter way would be a provision
authorizing the Secretary of State to pro
vide for the admission of immigrants flee
ing from war or political oppression or in
| consequence of political disorder.
After a long discussion Morgan's amend
ment was modified so that "the act shall
not apply to persons arriving in the United
States from any port or place in the Island
of Cuba during the continuance of tbe dis
i orders there, provided that such persons
j have heretofore been inhabitants of that
island," was agreed to â ayes 47, noe* 6â6 â
the negative votes being given by Caffery
(D.) of Louisiana. Hill (D.) of New York,
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky, Palmer (D.) of
Illinois, Pettigrew (S. R.)of South Dakota
and Waltliali (D. ) of Mississippi.
Elkins (R.) of West Virginia offered an
amendment for tbe collection of a head
tax o. f $10 on all immigrants coming to the
United States in vessels not of the United
States.
Nelson (R.) of Minnesota opposed the
amendment, saying that he would rather
vote to prevent immigration altogether
than vote for an amendment that would
be a tax on common humanity and tbat
would make the United States the most
mercenary and abject of the nations of the
earth.
Elkins spoke in support of his amend
ment, urging that the American steam
ship lines could bring in all tbe immi
grant?, and tnat besides it was desirable to
restrict immigration.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire op
posed the amendment, saying that be was
willing to aid the American steamship
lines by appropriations from the treasury,
but hewas not willing to have a head tax
imposed on immigrants.
Perkins (R.) of California favored the
amendment, the effect of which, he said,
would be to maKe a gift of $10 to the im
migrant who came to the United States
in a ship fls'insi "Old Glory," and also
give the immigrant his first lesson in
American citizenship.
Hill (D.) i of New York declared that in
his opimnion tbe amendment was entirely
in the wrong direction. It had been de
fended on the high and lofty ground of
protection. It was the principle of pro
tection run mad, of paternalism run mad.
It would be better to provide that there
should be no immigration at all.
Wollcoit(R.) of Colorado also opposed
the amendment. The effect of it would
be, he said, to cause immigrants from
Europe to land at a Canadian port and to
cross the St. Lawrence into the United
States, and to cause immigrants from
China ttnd Japan to take steamships to
Vancouver â inasmuch as the amendment
would not apply to immigrants coming by
land.
After further discussion Elkins 1 amend
ment was rejected.
Morgan (D. ) of Alabama offered an
amendment prohibiting the naturaliza
tion of an alien "who cannot read cor
rectly the ten commandments and the
constitution of the United States printed
in some language," and made an argu
ment in support of it.
Lodge opposed tbe amendment as open
ing up new and important questions. He
moved to lay it on the table. The motion
was agreed to â ayes 45, noes 16.
The bill was then passed â ayes 52, noes
10. The following is the vote in detail:
Ayesâ Allen, Bacon, Baker, Bate, Berry,
Brown, Burrows, Butler, Cail, Cameron, Can
non, ChmidleV Chilton, ClarJc, Davis, Dubols,
Eikins, Faulkner, Frye, Gallinger, Hale, Hans

The bill, which is a substitute for the
House bill passed on the 20th of May last,
is as follows:
"That section 1 of the act of March 3,
1891, in amendment of the immigration
and contract labor acts, be and is hereby
amended by adding to the classes of aliens
thereby barred from admission to the
United States the following: All persons
over 16 years of age who cannot read and
write the languege of their native coun
try or some other language, but an ad
missible immigrant over such age of 16
may bring in with him or send for his
wife or parent or grandparent or minor
child or granachiid, notwithstanding their
inability to read and write.
"For the purpose of testing the ability
of the immigrant to read and write, as re
quired by the foregoing section, the in
spection officers shall be iurniHhed with
copies of the constitution of the United
States, printed on numbered uniform
pasteboard slips, each containiug five lines
of such constitution printed in various
languages in double-leaded small pica
type.
"Those slips shall be kept in boxes made
for that purpose and so constructed as to
conceal the slips from view, each box to
contain slips of but one language, and
the immigrant may designate the lan
guage in which he prefers the test shall
be made. Each immigrant shall be re
quired to draw one of said slips from the
box and read, and afterward write out in
full view of the immigration officers the
five lines printed thereon. Each slip shall
be returned to the box immediately after
the test is finished and the contents of
the box shall be shaken up by the inspec
tion officer before another drawing is
made. No immigrant failing to read and
write out the slipthus drawn by him shall
be admitted, but he shall be returned to
tbe country from which he came at the
expense of the steamship or railroad com
pany which brought him, as now provided
iv the Jaw. The inspection officers shall
keep in a box at alt times a full nnruber of
said printed pasteboard slips, and in the
case of each excluded immigrant shall
keep a certified memorandum of the num
ber of the slip which the said immigrant
failed to read or copy out in writing.
"The act slnll not apply to persons ar
riving in the United States from any port
or place in Cuba during tbe continuance
of the present disorders, provided that
such persons shall have been residents of
that country. That this act ahall take ef
fect three months after its passage.
A committee of conference was ordered,
Senators Lodge (R. ) of Massachusetts,
Chandler (R.) oi New Hampshire, and
Faulkner (D.) of Virginia, being ap
pointed conferees on the part of the Sen
ate.
Arid then after a short executive ses

organization to adopt a monogram label
for all branches under tue National body,
and after much discussion it was ac
quiesced in.
A resolution indorsing the boycott on
the goods of the American TobaccD Com
pany was passed.
The Amalgamated Association secured
the floor and asked to have a committee
of three appointed to investigate rumors
and charges being lreeJy circulated in
hotel lobbies and streets reflecting on the
officers of the American Federation of
Labor. Delegate Warner of tue Machin
ists' International Association moved
that Mahon be ordered to be present at
the afternoon's session.
On the opening of tbe afternoon session
the committee on resolutions presented a
set from J. P. McGuire, recommending
that local unions affiliated with the Ameri
can Federatioji of Labor, so change their
laws that dues of members suall not da
less than 50 cents a montn, preferably 25
cents a week, that on failure to comply
with this request within six months the
cnarters of unions so failing shall be re
voked, and that no charters be hereafter
granted to organizations unless their by
laws provide for monthly dues of at least
50 cents. The committee recommended
their adoption. A lively discussion fol
lowed lasting for more than two hours.
Several amendments were submitted and
lost.
The original resolutions were adopted
by a decided majority.
Delegate O'Snilivan of the Massachu
setts State Federation moved that the con
vention go into executive session for the
consideration of charges against officers
which W. I). Mahon had been ordered at
tbe morning session by resolution to re
port, in writing, to the afternoon session
for investigation In open meeting. Dele
gares Ashe and Warner, Machinists' Inter
national Association; Tomson Engineers,
Kreyling, St. Louis Trades and Labor
Council; Sermon, Journeymen Tailors'
Union; Luce, Carriage- workers; YarnelJ,
Carpenters and Joiners, and a number oi
others in eloquent addresses urged the
convention not to commit this great blun
der. They argued that the matter had
been tirst broached in open meeting, tbe
convention had by resolution ordered the
investigation to be made in open
session and to go behind closed doors
with it now could not fail to cause sus
picion of whitewashing and comment
that would be an injury to the organiza
tion which it would be extremely difficult
to rectiriy, if indeed such a result could
ever be accomplished.
Delegates Thomas I. Kidd, Wood
workers' International Union, P. H.
Penna of the United Mine-workers of
America and one or two others spoke in
favor of the secret session, holding that
the matter was one whicn concerned only
the organization, and that if there was
any dirty linen to be washed it should be
done in the back kitchen with all the doors
locked.
The original motion was put to a vote
and carried, about two-thirds of the dele
gates voting for it. On motion it was
decided to remain in session to carry on
the investigation without adjourning at
tbe regular time for supper.
After the reporters and others not dele
gates had lelt the convention ball Dele
gate Mahon submitted a written state
ment of the rumors, to which he called
the attention of the convention. The Im
port of them was that President Gompers
had taken action or negotiated with
Chairman Jones and other prominent men
of the Democratic party in tbe late cam
paign as president of the American Fede
ration of Labor. It was stated that Secre
tary McCraith was aware of this corre
spondence, and feeling that Mr. Gompers
had exceeded his prerogatives as president
in the matter, the secretary bad spoken to
member- of the executive council about it.
Out of this sprang all the runiora alleged,
but Deleeate Mahon could give the names
of but three persons whom he had heard
mention the matter.
All of the letters forming the correspond
ence of alle.ed political negotiations were
read bsore the secret session. Some of
them referred to the free coinage of silver
at 16 to 1. which the federation had in
dorsed at each of its three last conventions,
and one requested President Gompers to
meet Chairman Jones and other Demo
cratic leaders and talk the matter over.
Mr. Gompers' reply to this was that he
was too busy to call upon the gentlemen,
but if they would meet him at Indianapolis
he would gladly grant an interview on the
subject, and it is stated that one man did
meet Gompers at Indianapolis. None of
the letters had been treated as private by
the president, but ail had been marked
political and pigeonholed in his secretary,
where they were at all times available to
the members of the executive council.
Another rumor was that Mr. Gompers
had gone to Chicago to confer with Chair
man Jones, but the Executive Council
Knew that trip was made with a chair
man of a National labor union and that
Jones was not met by Mr. Gompers.
Delegate Fenna of the Miners' Union
offered the following, which wan carried,
t iree delegates voting against it, alter ex
plaining that they did so only because of
fear tbat voting for it might be construed
as indorsement of free-sitver coinage:
Whereas, Having heard the charges of al
leged wrongdoing by President Gompers in
the recent political campaign;
Resolved, That we indorse the president's
position, dismiss the charges aud exonerate
him from blame.
The following offered by Delegate Mc-
Neil of Boston was adopted unanimously:
Hetolved, That the delegates to the sixteenth
annual conventionof the American Federation
of Labor do hereby In the most unquestionable
language express their fullest confidence in
President Gompers as a man worthy of the
cause he has espoused and for which he has
sacrificed his time, health and ability.
During the meeting a question arose as
to the relations that have existed between
members of the executive council, and
each of them personally testified that they
had always been ot the most pleasant
character.
A resolution of confidence in the coun
cil was passed and the executive session
adjourned.
It is given out to-night that after the
meeting Secretary McCraith announced
that ho will not be a candidate for re-elec
tion. His former friends concede that he
will never again be prominent in the Fed
eration of Labor. There are many insin
uations regarding the friends of W. C.
Pomeroy, whose credentials were rejected
by the convention, having a hand in tbe
mess, and others who have failed to real
ize their aspirations in the American Fed
eration of Labor, but no one hazards a
specific charge.

any relief. Dr. W. K. Vance, at the State

examination of my case and pronounced
it one of Bronchial Asthma, He placed
me under a course of electrical treatment
with mi dicines combined, and I at once
be -ran to pick up, and am now wonder-
fully improved in health 3 and spirits. As
this is the first and only relief thai. I have
obtained from my distressing complaint I

KEY WEST, Fla, Dec. 17.â Passengers
by the Olivette Jast night report great un
' easiness is felt in Havana on account of
uncertainty of Maceo's death. It is re
ported on good authority that General
Prats, commander of Matanzas province,
has notified General Weyier by telegram
to cease all demonstrations on account of
the death of Maceo and that General
r .Bernal of said province had an engage
ment Tuesday week with Maceo, who
had 5000 rue n with him. The Spaniards
report a victory as usual. Passengers
â¢?tate that the report of Maceo's deatn is
â¢ well understood in Havana ana that it
â¢ was made up by order of the home gov
ernment to influence the Congress of the
United States. There was the wildest
..kind of excitement on the dock last night
â¢ when this statement was made. The
.. cruiser Raleigh returned yesterday after
noon from her chase after the Three
Friends. It is reported that they did not
' b-e anything of her. It is reported on
good authority that a small boat landed
at this port from the Three Friends about
4 o'clock.
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 17.â The bulletin
issued by the Government to-day regard
ing engagements of the troops is unim
portant.
A correspondent at Guanajay reports
that the forces under Major La Costa have
captured at Mosquito Beach a Spanish
deserter, who belonged to the Alfonso
â Thirteenth Battalion. The prisoner says
that he was forced to join Maceo's forces
.in. Pinar del Rio. He repeats the story
..that Maceo did not cross the trocha on
â¢ lan-d, but went by sea around the northern
end of it. After landing in the province
of Havana Maceo met the forces of Lieu
tenant Vasquez, who was waiting at Mos
â â¢cjuito Beach, between Mariel and Banes.
:Thn prisoner complains that he was ill
â¢ treated by the rebels. His story is con
sidered suspicious, and he will be tried by
A court-martial.
.! .The Queen Resent ha* sent a dispatch
to Captain-General Weyier compliment
ing him upon the result of his campaign
:against the insurgents.
â  . Advices from the province of Pinar del
Ilio are to the effect that several Spanish
â¢battalions have penetrated to the interior
of the hills, in places that were consid
ered impregnable by the rebels. The in
â  s.urgents had disappeared, so the troops
burned the but 3 that bad been occupied
by them. A number of horses and cattle
were captured. The officers commanding
in Pinar del Rio have no idea of the pres
ent locality of the rebels in that province.
Scouting parties have failed to learn their
whereabouts, but the military profes3 to
believe that their abandonment of almost
unassailable positions is proof of the dis
organization that has followed the death
of Maceo.
Indications point to rebel parties hav
ing entered the province of Matanzas.
Their trails show the direction in which
they have gone and a Spanish column is
following in their track. It is believed
that a concentration is intended in Santn
Clara province of rebels from the east and
west. The Government says it is watch
ing the movements and so far as can be
gathered from outside sources it is doing
little besides watching to prevent the reb
els from carrying out their plan.
A colored woman named Francisca Her
rara has been tried by court-martial here
oji a charge of rebellion. The prosecutor
asked that she be sentenced to death. The
sentence of the court-martial, if it has
been passed, has not been made public
The Diario de la Marina continues to
publish protests against the stories printed
in the United States regarding the man
ner in which Maceo met his death. It
maintains that the rebel leader was shot
in open battle. In a leader it says, with
an unconscious reflection on the Spanish
character, that the stories of assassination
reflect more to the discredit of Maceo in
accepting the alleged invitation to parley
than to diminishing the tame, honor and
chivalry of the Spaniards.
In this sentence the Diario de la Marina
shows unintentionally that in its opinion
Maceo did not in trusting to a Spanish
flag of truce show the intelligence ex
pected of him.
La Lucha bitterly comments upon the
news received from the United States and
claims mat the American sympathy for
the rebels is due to a subsidized press. It
says that the Government is responsible
for not employing the press the same as the
insurgents, adding that if It did so it
would find tne newspapers a powerful
medium for the defense of the Spanish
cause.
RUINED BY THE SPANIARDS.
JJettruction of Xrancitco Seiglie's Plan
tation by Order of ffeyler.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 17.â Another
instance of an American cit'zen, once
wealthy, who has been ruined by the war
in Cuba, is afforded in the case of Fran
cisco Seigle in this city, who, less than
ten months ago, was one of the richest
sugar-planters in that unfortunate island,
but who to-day is practically penniless.
His name is brought into prominence by
a decision just rendered by Judge Roger
A. Pryor in the Supreme Court in a case
in which the New York Life Insuranco
Company was the defendant. Mr. Seigiie,
while a Cuban by birth, is an American
by naturalization. He has spent mucn
time in this city, where he and his wife
have many friends.
Hi 3 money was invested in a sugar
plantation in the province of Santa Clara.
The plantation was one of the largest in
that part of the island, including the pri
vate residence of the proprietor and his
family, and was estimated to be
worth about $1,000,000. The break
ing out of the revolution affected Mr.
Seiglie's business, bnt he continued to
carry on his plantation. General Maceo
pave him permission, as well as other
owners of plantations, to grind sugar, on
their agreement to pay a certain amount
of taxes to the Cuban Government. His
acceptance of Maceo's offer aroused the
anger of Captain-General Weyier, who de
clared that if he and other American
planters did not ceose making sugar he
would destroy their plantations.
Mr. Seisrlie, like many others, refused
to3top ouerating his plantation, relying
on his rights as an American citizen.
About the end of April last the Spanish
troops appeared at the plantation and
began burning the cane, which repre
sented hundreds of thousands of dollars
in value. Soon afterward Mr. Sei.-lie, re
fusing to accede to Weyler's repeated
threats against him and other American
planters in particular, was visited by a
Spanish officer, who s:i id that General Wey
ier had ordered that every building on the
Dlantution should be burned. Then the
Spaniards fired all the buildings, and in a
short time not a stick was left standing.
The homeless family sought refuge in the
town of Sague la Grande.
About the only thing left to Mr. Sieglie
on which he could raise money for the
support of himself and family was a life
insurance policy for $5000 in ihe New
York Life Insurance Company, which he
had taken out in April. 1875. The policy
was made in favor of his wife.
Mr. Seigiie came to this city to arrange
with the insurance company for a loan on
the policy. The company was not desir
ous of adopting his proposition unless
certain legal points were settled, but
agreed to advance Mr. Seigiie $IGSO on the
policy if the court held it legal. In his
statement to the court Mr. Seigiie 6aid
that the money he sought to borrow was
necessary for the support of his wife and
children. Judge Pryor has decided that
the loaning of the money to Mr. Seigiie
does not in any way affect the policy.
Mr. Seiclie has filed a claim against the
Spanish Government for the destruction
of his plantations.
AN APPEAL OF THE LEAGUE.
Citizem Who Demand Recognition for
ihr Cuban Patriots.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 17.â Colonel
Ethan Allen, president of the Cuban
League of the United States, which wag
organized the other evening by a number
of prominent New Yorkers at the Fifth
avenue Hotel, issued an address to the
public to-day, in which he sets fortti the
principles and purposes of the organiza
tion. The address, after reviewing the
struggle in Cuba from its inception to the
present time, says:
We are charged before the world with im
potency in not protecting our own citizens
asainst Spanish violence 011 the Cuban soil
and in hushing our indignation at unnum
bered cruelties in Cuba, while millions ot
American capital invested there ts pradually
disappearing, which would be saved by the
intervention of this Government.
Fellow citizens, it is due to ourselves as well
as to Cuba that this record should be reversed.
This has not been our record hitherto and we
are persuaded will not remain so now when
an appeal is made to the humanity a) well as
to tne material interest of our people. We do
not propose, nor is it necessary to violate our
laws. But if the laws stand in the way then
change the laws. We, the people, are the
source of power and may dictate what tne law
shall be aud therefore cannot shield ourselves
behind the statutory phraseology from tho
odium of not fulfilling our Datnral obligations
toward a people struggling to be free.
Let us so speak that the executive of this
Nation and our representntives in Corgress
shall recognize Cuban independence aud all
will be veil. We are not required to raise bat
talions of men nor to furnish ships of wur, but
we are called upon to dec-are that the heart
oi this Nation Is with the oppressed Cubans,
and then with her independence scknowl
edged her unarmed heroes may obtain from
us, as required, the equipments ot war, as
Spain has done herutoiore, and thi:.s we blaze
the way for a final victory us surely to triumph
as in the end right triumiihs over wrong.

under Gomez for "Cuba Libre." One of
the Omaha roads refused to give a rate,
stating that it is a business that it does
not care to handle, Jor th j reason that it
might lead to trouble with the Govern
ment. The cheapest rate from Denver to
a gulf port is $31 75â to Galveston. The
request for the rate says ttiat the party
desires to leave Denver at once. There is
considerable speculation as to whether or
not the Government would permit a body
of 200 men to traverse the country without
interruption, when it was destined for an
other country with the .avowed intention
of lighting.
The men who have gone to Cuba pre
viously have gone in threes and foots, so
as not to attract attention. The Denver
party is the largest yet organized to go in
a body. After arrival at a Gulf port the
cost of transportation to Cuba would be
borne by the Junta.
GO TO FIGHT FOR CUBA.
Eighty- Five Port Angel** Young ill en
Will Shoulder Muiket*.
PORT ANGELES, Wash., Dec. 17.â The
Cuban Junta has a representative in this
city who has succeeded in recruiting
eighty-rive young men for the Cuban
army. They are prepared to leave for the
East on receiving transportation, which
has been promised them by the New York
Junta, and it is authoritatively stated that
they will be joined by several other com
panies which have been organized on the
Sound.
The plans as outlined by the New York
Junta are that they shall proceed to St.
Louis, where they will be supplied with
arms and six months' provisions. Tiieir
destination from that point is kept secret,
but they are promised safe transportation
to Cuba. In the event of the success of
the insurgent army those who enlisted are
to receive a tract of land, the extent of
which is to depend upon its value, but to
be not less than eighty acres. This land
is to be supplied by the eonhscation of the
property of Spanish planters. Agricul
tural implements are also promised for
working the land.
XMsnXA.SK AS WAR SPIRIT.
Governor Holcomb Pledge.* His People
, to the- Support of Cuba.
LINCOLN, Nker., Dec. 17.â Governor
Holcomb to-day made public his attitude
concerning the Cuban insurgnnts and the
alleged assassination of General Maceo.
He said: '"The belligerent rights of Cuban
revolutionists should be recognized by our
Government. Their valiant light so long
continued to free themselves from the
yoke of European oppression entitles them
to the sympathy of every American."
The Governor declared that in the event
of war with a foreign nation Nebraska
could furnish 1200 drilled and organized
troops, and that 200.000 stood ready to de
fend the country's honor.
Major Fehet, United States army, of the
Governor's staff, who is familiar with

INDIGNANT DENIALS.
Published Statement it hnrized by the
Spanish Govern tnent.
MADRID, Spain, Dec. 17.â The Spanish
Government has authorized the publica
tion by the newspapers here of a state
ment declaring that the rumors that Gen
eral Maceo was murdered by poison or in
any other manner are baseless and ridicu
lous, and asserting th&t the insurgent
leader was killed in a fortuitous encoun
ter between the rebels and the Spanish
troops under Major Cirujeda.
VOLUNTERS FROM IDAHO.
Dr. Rooker Organizing a Company at
P< catello.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 17.â A com
pany of volunteers is being organized at
Pocatello, Idaho, by Dr. C. N. Rooker, to
go to Cuba to join the insurgents. Fifty
men, fully armed and equipped, will be
ready to leave for New Y r ork on Saturday,
whence, the plan is, they will saii for
Florida, ostensibly to worfc in the mines,
but in reality to be landed on the island of
Cuba. Rooker is a noted Western char
acter, a dead shot and of unquestioned
bravery. He will head the band, and
claims to be in possession of authority
from prominent Cubans in the East to or
ganize a company of troops to fight for
Cuban independence.
Enlittntent of JUen.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 17.â 1t is
said at the Department of Justice that no
new instructions have been sent to United
States Marsiials and District Attorneys
concerning the enlistment of men for
service against the Spanish forces in Cuba.
Instructions covering this subject were
sent out last spring, and officers of this
department who are acting in the matter
at present are taking proceedings, accord
ing to statements made to-day, on the ba
sis ot those orders. It is likely, however,
that the attention of marshals and attor
neys will be invited auew to the previous
directions.

DES MOINES, lowa, Dec. 17 Governor
F. M. Drake gave out an interview to-day
in which he says be thinks it is time for
the United States to recognize the inde

warmly of tne Cuban cause, and is anx
ious to aid the patriots. Ailjutant-Ueneral

who want arms to po to the front. Gov
ernor Drake denies the rumor that lie
court-martialed Captain George P. Guoyot,
his chief engineer, wno is raising a regi

is iv sympathy with Guoyot.
CONDUCTED WITH SECRECY.
Very Few People in Honolulu Knew Any-
thing About the Departure of
the Ex- Queen.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Dec. 10.â The
United States ship Alert, to relieve the
Adams, arrived December 9, twenty-one
days from San Francisco.
The ex-Queen's departure last week was
conducted with extreme secrecy. On her
way to the ship she called to say good-by
to President Dole, which was the first in
timation of her intention of going. Only
hali a dozen friends in the secret were at
the ship to see her off. Nothing has
transpired as to her real errand on this
visit, which is made ostensibly for change
and health, although in the winter, which
is likely to be severe on her. A belief pre
vails that she hopes to be able to make
her personal influence effective against
annexation. Interest here in her move
ments seems to be freble.
The old Annexation Club, which became
defunct after Blount's visit, was reorgan
ized on the 4th, L. A. Tburston being
chosen president. Interest in annexation
has revived into high activity. One lead
ing planter, the German millionaire, Isen
burg, strenuously opposes it, solely from
the side of sugar ana contract labor. Some
other planters are with him. The Gov
ernment and most of the white citizens are
anxious to secure annexation for the s:ike
cf assured political stability. The anti-
Anierican enemies of annexation continue
to inflame the native mind against the
measure, as being a robbery of their coun
try, their flag and their independence.
A largo body of the more intelligent na
tives regard annexation as the needed
safeguard of tiieir rights and franchises.
The late census shows a population of
109.009, an increase in six years of 19,019.
or 21 percent. The increase is chiefly in
Japanese.
RETURN OF A DIPLOMAT.
It iiivta Jitae to Humor* JJegartUng the
Policy of 7<iM.Â«t<F.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 17.â A special
cable dispatch to the Herald from Con
stantinople says: The return of the
Russian Embassador, M. de Nelidoff,
yesterday afternoon created a mild flutter
of speculative excitement, as he is the
bearer of the latest instruction of the Czar
for the future policy of Russia. The
general opinion here is that Russia has
not changed her policy of linn moral
pressure to obtain tne necessary reforms,
in conjunction with the other powers, but
will show equal firmness against force
being used.
The powers will, in the opinion of a high
diplomat, now formulate extensive de
mands, but are prepared to accept much
less than they ask lor.
A sensational account published in the
London Daily Mail representing that a
reifn of terror is existing here, owing to
the arrest of a few young Turks, is wildly
imaginative.
A dispatch from Canea, Crete, Decem
ber 14, states that the gendarmerie reor
ganization committee has arrived there
and has calmed the excitement that was
prevailing.

SUDDEN DEATH OF
A NOTED MAGICIAN.
Alexander Herrmann Ex
pires in His Private Car
While Traveling.
From an Early Age Hs Was
Known as the Best in His
Line in the World.
One of the Last Acts of This Re
markable Man Was to Befriend
a Stranded Show.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Dec. 17.-Pro
fessor Alexander Herrmann, the magi
cian, who appeared at the Lyceum
Theater last night, concluding an engage
ment of three performances, died this
morning from heart disease in his private
The Late Professor Alexander Herrmann, Greatest of American
Prestidigitateurs.
car while on the Buffalo, Rochester and
Pittsburg road on his way to Bradford,
Pa., where he was to open an engagement
this evening.
Professor Herrmann was as well as usual
when he left this city this morning at 7:30
o'clock. He had passed the night in his
private car and was in bed when word was
sent from it to the station-master at Great
Valley that he was ill and the attendance
of a physician was desired. Before a phy
sician could get to the car Herrmann was
dead. The car was taken to Salamanca
with the body. When he took leave of
Manager Pierce of the Lyceum after the
performance last night Herrmann was in
apparently perfect health. He was en
tertained at the Genesee Valley Club later
and seemed to be all right when accom
panied to his private car by several of his
Rochester friends.
One of the last acts of Herrmann was to
extend financial aid to a stranded theatri
cal company In this city. Tne "Ameri
can Cousin" Company broke up at the
Academy here last week and yesterday
Mr. Herrmann was made aware of the
fact and immediately telephoned the ho
tel where they were stopping to send him
the bill of $50 and to tell all the members
to come to bis show last night and he
would have their railroad tickets to New
York all ready for them.
Alexander F. Herrmann was a German.
His father was a celebrated physician in
his way and had a very large practice in
Paris, where he settled soon after his mar
riage. Herrmann was bora in Paris about
50 years aifo. His father was one of the
best magicians in Europe, but made no
use oi his powers in public. Herrmann's
eldest brother adopted magic as a profes
sion when a boy and wanted Alexander to
act as his assistant, ilis father objected
and Alexander was kidnaped by his
brother and taken to St. Petersburg
when he was 11 years of age. Within
three year 3he was far more clever than
bis brother and at the age of 14 he
ceased to act with him, went alone to
Spain and made bis debut before the
Queen.
From this time Herrmann was the rec
ognized master of hand magic. He made
his first appearance in America at the
Academy of Music, New York, about
twenty-five years ago, and since then he
took out his paper* of citizenship and
fixed his permanent residence in this
country. He made three toursr of the
world and possessed medals and tokens
from the rulers of almost every nation.
He spoke Spanish, German, French, Chi
nese and Russian as well as he did English.
He wrote a great deal for newspapers
and magazines, built two theaters and was
interested in many theatrical venture",
and made and lost a great deal of money
in Wall Street.
He always traveled in his own parlor
car, and carried from four to live horses
in a c\r built for their accommodation.
He owned one of the largest steam yacnts
in the New York Yacht Club and a park
and villa on Long I*land, and belonged to
over 100 clubs in Europe and America.
He leased McCall's Opera-house in Phila
delphia in the fall of IFBB and changed its
name to Herrmann's Theater. After hold
ing the playhouse for a year he dispospd
of it to other persons. He took the old
San Francisco Minstrel Hall in New York,
fitted it up at a large expense, and also re
named the place as Herrmann's Theater.
The building was badly damaged in Janu
ary, 1891, by a fire which destroyed the
Fifth-a venue Theater.
PLANS OF A COLORED MAN.
It Is baM lhat Washington Seek* a
Place in the Cabinet.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Dec. 17â A Bun
special from Montgomery, Ala,, says:
Booker T. Washington, the negro princi
pal of the State Normal and Industrial
College for Negroes at Tuskegee, is being
vigorously pushed by his negro friends in
Georgia and Alabama for a place in Me-
Kinley's Cabinet. Washington has been
in toe East (or some time, ostensibly for
the purpose of raising funds for the better
ment of his school.
A press dispatch Tuesday brought news
that he had raised same $30,000 in Boston.
It is hinted, however, that while he is
putting in some good work for the school
he is also looking over the field and inves
tigating as to his chances for a Cabinet
place.
The white people here who know Wash
ington best are confident that he has no
aspirations to a Cabinet portfolio. They
believe the scheme has been got up
without his knowledge or consent and
that he will discourage it unon bis return
to Alabama. Referring to the matter the
Tuskaloosa Chronicle, the negro organ of
the State, has this to say : "We would be
pleased to see one of our race highly ele
vated, but do not think such a thing
probable at this time."

Frantic Rush Into tie Streets, Dur
ing Which One Woman Dies
From Fright.
LONDON, Eng., Dec. 17.â Two strong
shocks of earthquake were felt throughout
Wales, the Midlands and the south of
England early this morning. The first
shock occurred at 3 o'clock and tho second
at 5:30.
The waves apparently passed from west
to east Houses were violently shaken,
beds moved irom their places, doors forced
open and furniture overturned.
Telegrams from all quarters concur in
the statement that the first shock was
about thirty seconds in duration and was
foiloived by a loud rumbling noise and
minor tremblings of the earth. The sec
ond shock wa3 shorter but more severe.
At Windsor, Cheltenham and some other
places the shock was so severe that people
rushed out of the houses in a panic, but
no one was hurt.
The cathedral at Hereford was some
what damaged, but no other serious dam
age was reported. Hereford Cathedral
wns begun in 1079 and was finished in
1445, but there have been two restorations
of the old structure, one in 1842 and one
in 1863.
At Hereford there was a rumbling
sound, followed by two crashes. Men
and women rushed frantically from their
houses into the streets. One woman died
irom fright.
At Ruthin the shocks were accompanied
by thunder and lightning, and for fifteen
seconds there was a distinct movement of
the enrth.
At Liverpool the shocks were followed
by thunder, lightning ana hail. There
were similar manifestations at Bridge
North, where the streets sa-med on fire
for several seconds. After this there was
a violent rejort, followed by a heavy
shock.
Only a slight quaking sensation was
felt at Manchester, Biiminpham and in
the nortbwestprn part of London. The
damage was not very serious anywhere.
SAD SUI CIDE OF A GIRL.
With Little Talent She Had an Ambition

NEW YORK, N. V., D.c. 17.â A special
cable to the Journal from Berlin says:
The pathetic suicide of Bertha Chickholm,
a 19-year-oid music student from lowa,
who drowned herself recently at Weimar,
has created a deep impression locally. The
young girl, who had been present during
the day at the festival of the Histrionic
Society, suffered, so friends say, from
hereditary melancholy, which was recently
increased by the consciousness that she
had no chance to become a prominent ar
tist, her talent being mediocre, although
her ambition was very great. Her body
will be removed 10 her home in lowa.

SOUTH AMERICAN
NEWS OF INTEREST
Chile Is Once More on the
Brink of Revo
lution.
Terrific Fighting to Suppress
the Indian Uprising
in Peru.
Awful Ravages of Yellow Fever,
and the Plague Reported From
Many Places
SAN DIEGO, Cat-., Dec. 17.â Interesting
South American news was received to-day
by the southern mails. The threatened
revolution in Cnile took the more pacific
turn of a crisis in the Cabinet. But
though there i 3 no open outbreak the situ
ation is so strained that predictions of
revolution are openly made, unless Presi
dent Errazuriz agrees to reforms de
manded by the Liberals. The Chamber
of Deputies is stiff-necked and vi.l not
compromise, while the President is equally
determined to have his way and to over
ride the Congress.
It was stated as early as November 10
that Errazuris, profiting by the tactics
pursued by his father when the latter was
confronted by a crisis, had determined to
throw the Clericals over entirely and go
openly and completely into the camp of
the Liberals. Though this would create
the. profoundest excitement, eauivalent to
a change on the part of President Cleve
land to Republicanism, this course was
tield out :iÂ« the only one open to the
Chilean Chief Magistrate. He was sup
posed to be confronted with the alterna
tive of accepting the Liberal demands or
lose his seat, and possibly his head. .Jut
up to the departure of the steamers from
Valparaiso the expected convulsion had
not occurred.
After vainly calling upon Sanchez Fon
tecilla to form a new Ministry, who
named men repugnant to the Liberals,
and who might have worked against a free
election next Ma rch, another man was
cailed upon. This was Eiias Fernandez
Albano. He was Minister of Public
Works under President Montt, After a
laborious effort Albano renounced tiie job
and left Errazur.z m a worse piight than
before. As a last resort Errazuriz called
upon Carlos Alunex, Balmaceda's Minis
ter to France daring the revolution of
1891. Tnis raised a trememious howl from
all parts of tbe republic, and what with
conspiracies and counterplots the admin
istration of Errazuriz the younger is prov
ing of great damage to Chile, if not invit
ing revolution.
The uprising among the Indiana in
Peru has assumed formidable size. At
Huauta, the center of the troub.es, the
Indians massed early in November, and
alter securing all possible booty th?y set
to work destroying ali kinds of property
in order to make pursuit by Government
troops difficult and costly. Plantations
â were burned from one end to the other,
cattle driven ot't" for the use of
the Indian hordes, all plunder found was
taken and the district left stark and black,
without a spear of grass for the Govern
ment cavalry.
Colonel Parra, an experienced Indian
fighter, was sent against the ragged and
poorly organized Indians, and a terrihc
battle followed on November 11. The In
dians displayed daring and a reckless dis
regard of life similar to the wild charges
of the Egyptian Dervishes. But the Peru
vians stood firm and poured into the In
dian crowds a terrific fire from Maxim
guns and Mannlicher rifles- The Indians
were in the town oi Huania and opposed
the entrance of the troops. Colonel Parra
ordered an advance and the machine guns
were brought into play. This hre forced
the Indians out, and they tried to over
whelm the artillerymen. The result was
a veritable slaughter. In less than half
an hour 500 Indians were dead on the
field, and toe troops entered the town and
possessed it.
Three Government officers and fifty sol
diers were killed. The Indians used rifles
as well as bows and arrows. They re
treated after tbe defeat and intrenched
themselves in the mountain strongholds
of Mariquita. An old Indian chief, Ja
cobo, is said to be their leader, and not
withstanding tne defeat of November 11
he has displayed genuine military ability.
The Government is determined to stamp
out the insurrection and has sent more
troops and artillery into the section sur
rounding liuania.
Yellow fever, and earthquakes have
devastated portions of the south, and
tbe fever extends as far north as Aca
pulco, where there were three cases in
quarantine. Farther south, and especially
in Salvador, the plague is practically be
yond control. The inhabitants ascribe it
to the great number of dead bodies left on
the ground during tbe battles during the
Ezcta revolution, many of wnicb were
never buried and spread contagion. At
Panama the fever is kept strictly confined,
but cases continually break out.
The city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, has the
plague, and other South American ports
have declared to shut off communication.
Th_ Bteamer Palena, which plies between
Guayaquil and Peruvian ports, was not
allowed to enter any port in Peru on ac
count of the widespread prevalence of
yellow fever in Ecuador's capital. The
British cruiser Comus, wiiicri arrived at
Paita from Guayaquil, was placed in quar
antine for ten days.
In the southern part of the Argentine
where cattle-raising in on a scale even
greater than it was formerly on the
American plains great trouble has been
caused by Indians who steal cattle and
sheep by the hundred, living off the car
cases and driving off herds into the moun
tains. The cowboys havo had several
skirmishes with the natives, which reached
the proportions of Battles. The natives
are wild, fierce and are equipped with
rifles, so that they are no mean foe.
The continued troubles resulted in a war
of extermination, the cowboys trying to
kill off tne Indians and the savages retali
ating by killing ail the cattle they could,
driving off 'others and hamstringing the
remainder, so they were rendered value
less to tiie owners.
The cattle-owners hit upon a unique re
venge, which it is believed will put a stop
to to the savage marauders. The cowboys
gathered all the cattle in settled districts
under protection, except a small band,
which was allowed to feed on tbe old
ranpe. In tho course of a week or s-o
ihe Indians had disposed of their stolen
cattle and were hungry again. They
swooped down on the little herd one
night and killed a few head and ham
strung the remainder.
They carried away a great deal of meat,
but could not get away with any live cat
tle on account of th 9 battle given by tne
herdsmen. When the Indians retired the
cowboys killed tbe hamstrung cattle and
placed in the carcases large quantities of
poison. They then hurriedly withdrew.
The savages returned that night in a
large body and carried off all tbe carcases.
They had a big powwow in the hills,
building great fares and barbecuing the
poisoned flesh. Brinks, squaws and ra
nooses ate the stuff, and tbe result was
the wholesale destruction of the camp.
Even their dogs died of the poison, and
the ponies, tied together, died of starva
tion. Tue cowboys found tbe camp three
days later and witnessed the horrible
sight. The sudden death of the camp
struck terror into the neighboring In
dians, and they have not molested the
cattle since.
FINE STEAMER LOST.
ThÂ« Valparaiso-Guayaquil Liner Chant
,. rey, Owntd at Valparaiso. ;â 
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 17.â Another
line steamer has been lost on the rocks of
Horcan, Chile, where the steamer centaur
of the Kosmos line was wrecked last July.
The last wreck is that of the Valparaiso-
Guayaquil liner Chantrey, owned at Val
paraiso. She was built in 1890 at New
castle, England, was of steel, 2791 tons
register, and had a valuable cargo. No
lives were lost. The Chantrey lelt Co
quimbo early on November 10 for\al
paraiso, and at about 3 o'clock on the 17th
struck on the rocke.
A shifting current, misty weather and
possible derangement caused the wreck.
The treacherous current, however, is ac
cepted as the true cause. The steamer
was soing at the rate of eight knots when
she struck. A big hole was stove in the
port side and within a few minutes the
engine-room was full of water, besides
several compartments.
The passenger., mails and treasnre were
landed in small boats without accident.
T!ie steamer Quintero was sent down from
Valparaiso and conveyed the passengers
to that port. The Chantrey carried 1359
tons of cargo, consisting principally of
coffee and. ores. The coffee was mostly
saved. _______
VISIT TO SANTA MONICA.
Deep- Water Harbor Commissioners Take
a Look at Mr. Huntington's Site â Go
to San Pedro To-Day.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 17.â The
deep-water harbor commissioners visited
Santa Monica to-day. They went in a
special train, which was in charge of
Superintendent J. A. Muir, the very ablest
lieutenant that Mr. Huntington has in
California. On reaching the Southern
Pacific "harbor" site the board was taken
to the long wharf and thoroughly in
spected it.
They were then taken on board of the
! company's tug Collis and sailed all about
i the piece of the vasty deep that Mr.
Huntington hopes to inclose by tbe use of
the Government's money. They made
some investigations as to the nature of
the ocean bed and tbe depth of water and
returned soon. In fact it was not a good
day for Santa Monica, as there was a
heavy swell, and the Collis reared and
bucked in bronco style. Admiral Walker
stood the test like an old salt, but the
others looked pale as they returned to
town.
This evening a committee consisting of
Jonn F. Francis, L. E. Mosher, W. W.
Woolwine and Henry Hawgood called on
! the board in ihe interest of San Pedro.
i Tne purpose was to ascertain how to pre
! .sent the evidence that had been gathered
jon the side of the people's harbor. No ar
: gun-en t wa3 attempted to-night, as the
I commissioners are very punctilious about
j listening to harbor talk outside of their
meetings.
Later'in the evening the Southern Pacfic
engineers, Mr. Cortuell and Mr. Hood,
appeared on the scene and chatted for an
hour or so with Admiral Walker and
j other Commissioners. President Heighton
! of the Terminal Railway was also a caller,
while there were a score or more of news
paper men on hand, Dut little informa
tion of value was attainable.
To-morrow the board will make its first
I visit to San Pedro, going for the purpose
! of taking a look about before commenc
ing the real work of collecting the tech
' nical data. Mr. Pratt, the efficient secre
| tary of tne board, has prepared a com
plete office at his room in the hotel, and
on Monday will be ready for the actual
labor which will then commence.
To-day the Free Harbor League com
; pleted its preparations and is all ready for
I the fray on the side of San Padro. What
i the Southern Pacific forces have in .the
way of evidence no one knows. One thing
is certain, and- that is that no misstate
ment of facts such as they indulged in in
the fight before Congress will be per
mitted.
Special experts have bsen detailed by
the Free Harbor League to watch for
false assertions on the part of the Hunt
i ington forces, and any such will at once
!be publicly denounced. Tbe public inter*
i edt in tbe contest has become intense,
i and the open meetings will have a tie"
| mendous attendance.

THE SATST FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1896.
TRIED TO WRECK
A STOCKTON HOUSE
Celestials Hurl a Bomb
Into a Japanese
Resort.
A Brave Policeman Extinguis
the Fuse and Prevents a
Disaster.
The Murderous Missile Would Have
Blown Up tbe Placs and Killed
the Occupants.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 17. -At an early
hour this morning anarchistic Mongolians
made an attempt to blow up a house on
Hunter street, between Market and Wash
ington, which is occupied by Japanese
courtesans. A bomb made for the occa
sion was thrown through a side window,
shattering three panes of glass. The "ii;
fernal machine" was quickly carried from
the front room by one of the occupants
and thrown into the back yard before the
fuse had burned down far enough to
ignite the explosive. One of tbe women
then blew furiously on a police-whistle,
and Captain Simpson, who heard the call,
rushed to the place. He saw the bomb in
the yard and cut the fuse off near the top
of the can. It was still smoldering when
the officer had arrived on the scene. An
examination of the bomb revealed the
fact that the thrower of it meant busi
ness. It consisted of a large can, ap
parently a lard can, in which had been
placed two pounds of black powder, a
stick of giant powder and two percussion
caps.
It is supposed that the caps were put
there in the hope that they would explode
upon the bombs striking the floor. The
fuse was ignited, though, in case the caps
did not work, which, as the event proved,
was the case. The powder was firmly
packed down with sand. Had the bomb
exploded it would have easily blown up
the house and killed the inmates.
The question which the officers are try
ing to find out is, Who threw the bomb?
The thrower of it lost no time in getting
out of sight, as no trace of him was seen
by any one. It is generally supposed that
a Chinaman tried to blow un tbe house.
The make of the instrument of destruc
tion bore the marks of Chinese ingenuity.
Besides the fuses there were some punks
protruding from it similar to those which
Chinese burn in front of their places. Up
to tbe present time the officers have been
unable to find any clew to the identity of

JAMESTOWN IN
SMOLDERING RUINS
Business Portion of the
Town Destroyed
by Fire.
Blankets, Buckets and Dynamite
Employed to Fight the
Flames.
Losses and Insuranceâ The Town to
Be Rebuiltâ Serious Injury
to a Fireman.
80N0RA, Cal., Dec. 17.â A great part
of Jamestown is in ashes, and where a
few days ago stood prosperous business
houses desolation appears in the thriving
mining town on the mother lode.
Thursday morning about 8 o'clock the
firebells rang out in Sonora for what
everybody believed to be a dangerous lire
in this city, but inquiry soon revealed the
fact that the fire was not here but at
Jamestown, a telegraphic message having
been sent here by way of Stockton for
help. The fire laddies from this town
quickly responded to the call, and lost no
time in getting to the scene of the con
flagration and to work, and by their heroic
and intelligent efforts did mucn toward
checking the further progress of the fire.
A Ca_l reporter was one of the earliest
of Sonora's citizens on the ground. Oh
entering the town a sorry spectacle pre
sented itself, for there, along the right
hand side of Jamestown, was nothing but
a charred and indistinguishable mass of
merchandise and household effects. The
streets were crowded not only with the
citizens of Jamestown and vicinity, but
with persons from Sonora as well, who
were doing their best to stay the further
progress of the fire fiend.
It appears tfcat about 6:30 a. m. C. C.
Stohe, proprietor of the Hotel Willows,
got up as was his wont and discovered
that the town had a very healthy fire in
progress. He at once gave the alarm and
soon some hundred of citizens gathered,
and lor more than an hour and a half
fought the flames, though at an awful
disadvantage.
Water could only be had by the method
of packing it in buckets, and so but very
little headway was made. Then a build
ing a little removed from the immediate
neighborhood of the fire was covered with
blankets and bucket after bucket of water
thrown over it, but this too failed, and the
building was soon enveloped by flames
and shortly afterward was nothing more
than a smoking ruin.
Heroic methods were found to be the
only ones that could be of any us. in say
ing the remaining portion of thi j town,
and so King Dynamite was brought into
means the fie was checked on its onward
course, and had this not, been effected jast
in the ' nick 'of time ; the handsome new
Hotel Willows ; and the Pioneer Livery
Stable would also have been in Â« hes - .. q f

The fire - appears to have started ma

door to Pedro's general store, and soon
spread some 300 feet up the street where
its progress as stated above was stayed by
the demolishing â¢of three buildings by
dynamite. The stores burnt were While s
bakery, Frank White's butcher-shop, Don
aldson's restaurant, Weinberg's fruit and
candy store, Rocco's saloon, tne postomce,
Jamestown Hotel, Shore's iod gin - house
and Pierano's general merchandise store.
But little insurance was carried by an y of
the merchants. Pierano carried $2000 in
the Phoenix of London and Province of
Washington, R. 1., and Weinberg was in
sured for but a nominal amount. I C
As a result of the conflagration the town
will as soon as possible have water-mains
put down, so that in case of fire this most
necessary element in fighting it will not
be Jacking. It will ,of course be some
time before Jamestown recovers from this
devastating fire, but no doubt, like the
pheuix, she will arise from her ashes and
be none the worse for her heavy loss.
New buildings will take the place of those
burned just as soon as the proper tire ad
justments can be made and lumber se
cured. For the time being, however, the
hotels and business-houses left will have
to do double duty. . â 
Pedro's general store had a most nar
row escape. The loss by the tire will
aggregate some $25,000. . Most of the
buildings destroyed were the property of
John Rocco of Algerine. That the fire
started in the bakery-shop of Joe White is
an established fact, but just owing to
what cause is a matter of conjecture. It
is the generally accepted theory, however,
that the baker toward the early morning
pulled the ashes from his firebox toward
the front and carelessly allowed some of
them to lie on the naked boards, which
caused the conflagration.
CRICO CITIZENS ENTHUNED.
Ten Thousand Dollar* liaised Toward
Butlding a Beet-Sugar Factory.
CHICO, Cal., Dec. 17.â The citizens of
this city are very much enthused over the
prospect of having a BUgar-beet factory
here. The project is now in the hands of
some of our most enterprising citizens
and will undoubtedly be carried through.
There is at present a sum in the neighbor
hood of $10,000 already subscribedand a
good prospect of more "large subscriptions
to come. This locality is peculiarly
adapted to the growing ot sugar beets,
which has been proven by past experi
ments, and will yiela a large quantity of
beets yearly.
Fire in a Vancouver Cooperage,
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 17.â The dry

FROM A FRUITLESS
CHASE OF DUNHAM
Ex- Marshal Gard and His
Posse Return to San
Diego.
The Oficers D^ny That They
Have Bsea Hunting the
Murderer.
Lissu3ted With tbe Outcome of Their
Efforts and Very Uacom
municativ;.
SAN DIKGO, Cal., Dec. 17.â Sheriff
Lyndon of Santa Clara County, ex-
Marshal Gard of Los Angeles and Deputy
Sheriff Ward and Detective Ell&worth of
this city returned to-night from tneir
hunt for Dunham. They did not get
Dunham nor see him, and were not chased
by Mexican rurales, because they pru
dently kept on the American side of the
line. They did stray over a few ieet, but
they had got wind, perhaps, of the
Mexican posse, ai.d they were very sure
of their ground before venturing into
Mexican territory.
Both Marshal Gard and Sheriff Lyndon
had the audacity to deny positively that
they had been hunting Dunhan at all,
though'Gard had a* positively told a Call
before he started that Dunham
was the man wanted.
"You'd be surprised now if I told you
that we are not after Dunham," said Gard
last night. "Wei!, that's what I say. We
are not after Dunham, but you can go
ahead and say so in the papers. We arÂ«
after- another man. and what is more we
didn't look for him in Mexico. I can't
tell you who the other man is, of course."
Sner.ff Lyndon was very uncommuni
cative. His manner, as well as that of
Marshal Gard, was one of disgust. They
did not want to talk of Dunham.
"Every time I move," said Snenff Lyn
don "tuey say I am after Dunham. I
wad not after Dunham this time. I was
after another man."
"Wm your mission successful?
"Not entirely." . .
Sheriff Lynaon said he would remain in
town a day or two and this in connection
with the lull details of the hunt after
Dunham, which were furnished by Detec
tive Ellsworth, indicate that the olncers
U'lieve thai they have got on Dunham s
t ail and will go out again soon. Detective
Ellsworth says so in that many words.
He Fays that while the chase was unsuc
essfnll enough was learned to give the
\ Sneers assurance that Dunham is some-
here in the lower country and that be
Cm be found.
"As soon as the papers stoo talking
about it, ami this chase blows over a
littie." said Ellsworth, "we will try it
aÂ»ain."
It wps the possession of a letter from
James Dunham, the murderer, to bis wife,
written two years ago, and describing a
cave near bis ranch called "Robbers'

Koost,'' and which Dunham called an
ideal hiding-place, that led Sheriff Lyndon
in this direction. Then, too, Charles
Dunham appeared here, evading the de
lectives who had been shadowing him at
San Jose. Dtective Ellsworth said:
''Sheriff Lyndon, after his arrival, told
me of several clews he had received re
garding Dunham's presence in this part of
the State. One of them was a letter re
ceived from a prospector who said he was
positive he had seen Dunham coming
down the Colorado P.iver.
"We started for the Dunham ranch and
made a complete investigation of the sur
rounding*, bui failed to find any trace of
the murderer.
"Our chief efforts were directed to find
ing the cave called 'Robbers' Roost' by
Dunham in his letter. All of yesterday
was spent in making a search of the can
yons and mountains in the vicinity of the
ranch, but not a trace of a cave could be
found. We started on the return trip
early this morning and arrived home at 7
o'clock this evening pretty well tired out.
We will start out again."
DR. O'CALLIGHAN RELEASED.
Interesting Reminiscences Recalled by
the Action of ihe Idaho Board
of Pardons.
BOISE, Idaho, Dec. 17.â The Idaho
Board of Pardons has pardoned Dr. E. J.
O'Csilighan on condition that he leaves
the State, the pardon to take effect on
Christmas day.
In 1885 G'Callighan killed John Breene
at Blackfoot and was convicted of murder
jin the first degree. The Supreme Court
reversed the judgment and his second sen
tence was to lite imprisonment. He
! entered the penitentiary in Marcn, 1886.
O'Cailighan was one of th > best known
| physicians in the southeastern part of the
' State and bad a practice extending into
Montana and Utah. He had s quarrel
with one Willard Crawford and the latter
threatened to kill him. On the night of
I the killing he was drinking with Btecne
I and the latter wentoutfor liquor. Though
he passed one through tne iront door, he
came buck by the door in the rear. O'Cal
ligiian heard him fumbling at the back
door and supposing that it was Crawford
who had come to Kill him he went to a
window and shot the man dead.
The board was petitioned by large num
| bers of people to pardon the convict, his
| old army associates being specially active
lin his behalf. It felt there was grave
dqjiubt about the legali'y of his detention,
and determined to set him at liberty.
There is an interesting story told in con
j nection with the action oftbe Supreme
Court in O'Callighan's case. Kentucky
Smith was his attorney. He had some de
cisions, based upon a statute of another
i State, giving the Supreme Court here au
thority to take such action. His plan
j was, as he explained it to a friend, to in
! duce tho court here to follow the deci
sions and then get the doctor out on a
writ of habeas corpus. Ihe court fell into
the trap, but O'Cailigban's friends were
satisfied when they knew he was saved
from the gallows, and declined to fnrnish
bonds for the proposed habeas corpus pro
ceedings. Hence the doctor has been in
the penitentiary for ten years, when, as
believed by attorneys, he could have been
set free in bixty days.
Gone to tht Happy Hunting Ground*.
ROCKFORD, Wash.. Dec. 17.-Gusta,
the Big Indian of the Ccenr d'Alene tribe,
has passed to the happy hunting ground.
Pneumonia and typhoid fever carried
him off. He was one of the most progres
sive Indians of the West. His home on
tbe reservation, eight miles southeast o!
Rockford, is improved in modern style.
He had a beautiful house, hordes and out
buildings, and about 400 acres under cul
tivation. When it came to carriages he
could outdo any man in the county. He
was buried in the Coeur d'Alene Indian
Jurying grounds.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1896.
CITRUS FAIR OF
THE SAN JOAQUIN
Throng of Visitors to the
Great Exposition at
Fresno.
Excursionists Are Greeted With
Music and Shown the
City's Sights.
Address of Welcoma and Response.
Th 3 Probable Prz -Winners.
A tay for the Children.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 17.â When the yel
low train with the silver letterine on the
San Francisco and San Jonquin Valley
Railroad ariived tiere ten minutes before
noon to-day with the Stockton excur
sionists to the San' Joaquin Valley Citrus
Fair a crowd was at the depot. The Citrus
Fair band played a lively tune and the
bell on the locomotive chimed in joyously
and harmoniously^ Principal among
those who welcomed the visitors were
members of the Chamber of Commerce
and the members of the Hundred Thou
sand Club, with their yellow ribbons
fluttering in the gentle valley breeze.
The people from the "Mill City" also had
yellow ribbons of their own. On them
was printed in black, "Stockton Commer
cial Association to the San Joaquin Valley
Citrus fair. 1 '
The excursionists were escorted up
town, and they dispersed among various
hotels. Colonel Berry's one car and one
horse streetcar line, which is the pride of
Tulare street and tlie wonder of strangers,
entered into active competition with
backs and carriages for the honor pf con
veying visitors in the direction of the bit;
pavilion. This horsecar line has advan
tages for Cclonel Berry possessed by no
other streetcar line in thÂ« world. It runs
first past his own h otel, and the colonel i
has the driver and the mule so well
trained that the car stops there whether
anybody wants to get off or not. It is
said here that the colonel has threatened
to run a spur track ri^bt through the
lobby and up to the hotel register if the
next alfalfa crop is good at Orangedale.
In the afternoon the Stocktonians were
shown further courtesies by the Hundred
Thousand Club rustlers. They wanted to
show the visitors "What we've got in
Fresno," and they did. After a short
glimpse of the beauties of the fail, car- i
riaees were provided and a drive was
had to the different places and points of
interest in the city. Many fruit, fig and
raisin-packinn houses were visited. A
seeded raisin company has orders that
will keep it busy two years ahead. It has
machinery for taking the seeds uut of rai
sins, saicito be the only machine of tho
kmtl In the uorl'l, which is not yet fully
patented. The visitors were cot permit
ted to see the machines, and the. remain
der of the admiring public which goes
that way does uot get any further into the
c n'idence of the firm than the door cf
the seeding department.
The management told the party to help
themselves*, and lor once everybody had
enough raisins. The party was piloted
over the city and through tue institutions
visited by H. C. B. Gill of the Illustrated
Monthly Interior. Mr. Gill also superin
tended the collection and the arrange
ment of the handsome exhibit of Stanis
laus County at the pavilion.
It was San Joaquin County day at the
'airÂ» N The attendance was good during the
afternoon. This evening another big
crowd was present. Every seat was occu
pied and the many aisles were crowded
with Fresno peot>le and visitors from the*
country and surrounding towns. The
formal exercises of welcome to tie Stock
tonians took place. E. F. Bernhard,
spokesman for the general committee, in
troduced Judge George E. Church of
Fresno, who delivered the address of wel
come, and P. A. Buell, president of tne
Stockton Commercial Association, who
man 1 the response.
Judge Church said: "California has
n;-ver failed to show that she is the best
place for civilized man to live in on the
whole civilized globe. But I take it that
the most fervent words of e.'cquence of
her most gifted sons or daughters could
never speac of her advantages with half
the e'oqnence that these silent exhibits
speak. These golden oranges and fruits
speak a language more eloquent than any
human tongue can utter. Here in this
great valiey, surrounded by ttiese moun
tain*, has been found a home so lining
that man may no longer dream of para
dise." [Applause]
Judge Church then referred to the days
of '49 and the struggles of early settlers,
and said: "But all that has passad away.
The time of nome bu.lding cume. When
it came the people were confronted by two
great drawbacks. One was the uncer
tainty of title and the other the great
holdings of land all over this slope. Men
would not build homes on uncertain ten
ure, but, thank God, they have settled
that.
"That other obstacle they are settling,
too, but I do not know that it will be fully
settled short of the single tax. I don't
kr.ow that it will be settied till it may be
made unlawful for any one to have such
large holdings of land. These great hold
ings are inimical to the upbuilding of a
great State.
"The little red schoo'.bouse," he contin
ued, "is the foundation of the American
home and American liberty. [Applause.]
We look for its establishment in settle
ments. In Fresno, greatly to our ad
vantage, tno large holdings were bought
up and divided into ?mali colony lots.
Men have established homes upon them
and ure bringing op families of children.
And that has made possible this great and
beautitul fair. To-morrow the sell .ols
will close, I understand, and 16J0 school
children will be here to see these exhibits.
It will be an object lesson to them, of
greaier benefit tuan all they learn in
books.
"This place is San Joaquin's to-day," he
said in conclusion, "and more than that,
our hear:s are San Joaquin's to-night. H
want to nay in conclusion to our visiting
friends, Enter in, take possession and en
joy yourselves."
President Buell replying, spoke sub
stantially as fellows: "I think you people
of Fresno have the test of it. Here you
have put up one of your most eloquent
speakers to talk to us, and then expect an
ordinary lumberman to compete with him.
[Laughter.] The people of Stockton and
fcan Joaquin have been most heartily re
ceived and welcomed here. We know that
the prosperity of a country depends
largely upon unity of action among its
people. It is wise that the people of
Stockton, Fresno and the San Joaquin
Valley are getting together. There is" no
better illustration oi the effect of coloniza
tion of land than around Fresno, and it is
a good effect.
"Riding down the valley to-day wo saw
tbousKuds of acres of fertile land without
a house upon it in any direction. It is
necessary for us to bring people out here
from the East and settle up this land.
You have abundant water for irrigation I
and you have irrigation canals. lam sur- I
prised at the magnitude and beauty of
your exhibits. They show what this val
ley can produce. We hope in the future
to invite j'on to a similar exhibition in
Stockton. We thank you for your hearty
welcome and reception to-day.""
To-morrow is children's day at the fair.
All the schools will close at noon and the
cnildren rf several benevolent institutions
will be admitted free. The admission fee
for school children has been reduced to 10
cent?. The business houses will close at
6 o'clock in the evening, so that the clerks
and other employes may have an oppor
tunity to take in the fair.
Saturday will be farmers' and Porter
villeV day. There will be an excursion]
from Ponerville. Word by wire was re- i
ceived to-day from the committee which i
went to San Francisco ia^t night that I
it has cone to work on the proposi- j
sition of getting up an excursion from
San Francisco to Ihe fair. There is al
ready some tals among the genera! com
mittee of extending the fair into next
week, and if an excursion is arranged
from the metropolis this will certainly be
done. The premiums will bo awarded
next Saturday.
It, is understood among exhibiters that
the names of the judges are not to be
made known till after the awards are
made. This is to prevent any possibility
o! influence. It is understood that Tulare
will get the lirst prize for county exhibit!
and Stanislaus second. Kings County
has sent in a box of tine raisins and Kern i
a few boxes of prunes. The only county j
now that is absolutely unrepresented is ;
Merced. The weather is bright and clear.
Many exhibitors and several citizens ex- j
pressed tneniselvÂ«s greatly pleased to-day |
with The Call's menu of exhibits show
ing the varied fertility of the valiey.
SUIT FOR DAMAGES.
Owen llV.ry Want* $5000 for False Itn-
priaonment. ,
FRE?NO, Cal., Dec. 17.â The trial of
tne suit of Owen Riley against George L.
Moore, a prominent butcher, for $5030
damages for false imprisonment was bej: un
before a jury in Judge Risley's court to
day. About a year ago the plaintiff was
arrested for perjury, on complaint of
Moore, and imprisoned in tbe County Jail
for five days pending the preliminary
examination. Moore failed to prosecute
tho charge and it was dismissed by Justice
St. John. The butcher 1 had alleged that
Riley swore falsely in a supplementary
proceeding in which both were interested
in regard to the ownership of some prop
erty in this city.
FRESNO ROYS A POLL ROAD.

FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 17.â The Board of
Supervisors has purchased the Fresno and
Pine Rid-e toll road for $75C0. It was
built five years ago by private parties at a
cost of $13,000, but the toils have not been
remunerative, and the owners were glad
to dispose of it for what they got. The
road is a fine piece of engineering work,
being up a very steep mountain side. It
is thirteen miles long and of easy grade.
It is situated fony mile^ east of this city,
and being fiee will be traveled a great
deal in the summer by campers to the

NATIONAL IRRIGATION CONGRESS.
President- Elect McKinley Sends a Letter
Expressing His Regret Over Being
Unabie to Attend.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 17.â The last day
of the fifth session of the National iiriga
tion congress was a busy one, and many
important matters were disposed of. The
congress was convened at 10 o'clock this
morning with representatives from
twenty-*ix States and Territories.
Judge Van Dyke of California addressed
the congress on forestry. In a forcible
I speech he pleaded for laws protecting the
j forests of arid America. He advocated
: the enactment of laws for the protection
of the forests from fires and prescribing
severe penalties lor the careless or ma
licious starting of fires in the vast timber
tracts of the country. He suggested dis
trict po lice patrols as the best means for
protecting the fore-t lands.
When Judge Van Dyke had concluded
the chairman read a letter from President
elect McKinley, expressing regret for in
j ability to attend the congress and tender
ing hi-* best wishes for it 3 success. The
convention enthusiastically applauded the
reading of the letter.
The official reports from the various
States were *cad.
Brigham Young- of Utah, a descendant
of the great Mormon leader, addressed tho
cenzress by special request. He spoke
eloquently of the advantages that have
been derived from the former sessions of
the congress, and predicted a bright future
for the great West when its arid wastes
shall hava been transformed into pros
perous farming communities.

He described in a graphic manner the
early struggles of the Mormons in Utah,
the construction of their homes and the
first attempts at irrigation under the most
adverse conditions, and compared the
arid waste of territory of those days with
the beautiful State of Utah to-day,
abounding in immense irrigation canals]
constructed on the most scientific princi
ples and at an expense of millions of dol
lars. His speech was one of the best de
livered at this session of the congress.
The election of officers Jor the ensuing
year resulted as foLows: Chairman, E. R.
Moses of Kansas; first vice-chairmau,
Brigham Young of Utah; second vice
chairman, E.G. Hudson of Illinois; secre
tary, S. M. Heintz of California; National
lecturer, Judge J. L. Emory of Kansas;
assistant National lecturer. I. A. Ford of
Nebraska; secretary, L. B. Brainerd of
Connecticut.
The selection of a place for the meeting
of the next annual session of the congress
was t en discussed. A vote was taken
and Lincoln, Nebr., was chosen by an
overwhelming majority.
At the afternoon session General O'Neil
of Arizona made a stirring address, criti
cizing severely the action of the irrigation
congress thus far for failure to form a
plan of action and for too much discus
sion. He proposed a bill for enactment
by the National Congress providing for
the aid of the Federal Government in the
reclamation of arid lands.
The bill proposes that the Government
shall loan to eacn of the arid States and
Territories $1,000,000 per annum for ten
years, to be returned by the Siatt-s from
the sale of land reclaimed by the expen
diture of this money.
After some discussion resolutions rela
ting to the Wright act were adopted and
the congress adjourned sine die.

surprising that it takes so much corn to

There seems to be enough money in the
treasury to run the Government this win

A DASTARDLY ATTACK.
The local columns of yesterday's Examiner contained a most infamous and
cowardly falsehood regarding the proprietor of The Call, and upon the editorial
page of that vile ana disreputable sheet the dastardly assault was repeated and
approved. Ths statements of the several gentlemen who know and who
fully set forth the facts regarding the affair in our own local columns will suffice to
show the public mind how utterly false the Examiner's statement was and to what
depths of depravity that newspaper has fallen in its willful disregard of the truth
wlien a lie, however phameless in its nakedness, will serve its purpose better.
The only possible excuse for this exhibition of infamy in journalism is
the eatine envy of a business rivalry which the Examiner is finding itself too
feeble to maintain. The growing greatness, popularity and success of the
Call is the Examiner's only reason for the publication of a villainous and
absolutely unwarranted es-ault upon the personal honor of its proprietor.
The use of such desperate tactics indicates the deeps of despair
into which the Examiner has been plunged not only ,by it* own reverses
but by the failing fortunes of its owner in New York. Both the Examiner and
its Eastern duplicate, the Kew York Journal, are known to be upon
the very verge of financial ruin on account of an insane effort of
their owner to make the extreme of nastiness in journalism a success. The Call has
undertaken to point out with some degree of clearness the certainty and the
proximity of Mr. Hearst's utter failure in this respect, and this and this alone is the
reason why The Call's proprietor is singled out for the present vile and infamous
assault.
What do men of honor, of reputation, of family pride and of self-rogard for their
good name think of a newspaper which will indulge in such disgraceful methods
and publish such palpable and reckless untruths? What citizen of
character, of prcbity, of business integrity or of honestly acquired property
is safe from the assaults of a journal so lost to decency and so wedded to shame?
What amount of 'patience in a community can endure the presence in
its midst of such a publication as the Examiner, which, having
itself descended to the very depth of dishonest and depraved journalism, reaches
upward daily a reeking hand in the desperate hope of dragging down those high in
public esteem to its own wretched level oi infamy and disrepute? What character is
too exalted, what career too honorable, what reputation too well assured, what home
too sacred for the slimy and venomous assault of this viper among the newspapers of
tne Pacihc Coast?
Hitherto decency, respectability and honor in this community have not had a
defender acain>t this characterless defamer of everything and everybody whose
position in public regard has been above its own hope of attainment. This condition,
however, shall no longer continue. The Call has erjtered thÂ« field not as the
protector of itself and its proprietor only, but also as the champion, the ally and the
defender of every man of honor, every citizen of character, every agency and advo
cate of morality, respectability and propriety which this slimy enemy of honesty,
truth and deceny dares to assail.
MARKET STREET.
The movement for the illumination of
Market street promises to e.o further and
achieve more than any similar action yet
taken in the City. There is a prospect
that our greatest thoroughfare will soon
be one of the most brilliantly lighted in
the world, and to that extent at least an
object for the admiration and the pride of
all citizens.
So much has been done for the improve
ment of o'her streets it has become a mat
ter of necessity for the business men and
property-owners on Market street to do
something to uphold the prestige of their
thoroughfare. While all other streets are
being more brightly lighted than ever, it
would be an act of folly for the Market
street people to remain backward and un
progressive.
It the plan proposed can be carried out |
Market street will shine as gayly and J
brilliantly as if every night were the oc- \
casion of some great festival. It is pro
posed in addition to electric lamps on
eacn side of the street to have something
like a rainbow of many-colored lamps
stretched the whole leng;h of the business
portion of the great thoroughfare over
the center of the street. T.iis will give
to that avenue an appearance the like of
which is not to be seen anywhere in the j
world, and will undoubtedly attract the j
praise of touri:-ts and win us a new fame
among great cities.
Tne swiftness with which the movement
for street lighting has been carried on in
so many parts of San Francisco is not
only excellent in itself, but gives encour- j
agement to the hope that other move
ments in the direction o providing better
streets for the City will be equally sue- |
cessful. Better lighting is not the only
requirement of our thoroughfares, and al- j
though its importance is not to be gain
sa d there are other needs more important
still.
Many of our business streets are
still covered with the cobblestones of what
may be called the dark ages of the City.
With the new illuminations there should
come a new light on the whole subject of
street improvements. The Market-street
merchants and property-owners will do
well ii they carry the work of illumina
tion to a greater degree of success than on
any other street, but they will do better if
they make it but the beginning of a pro
gressive movement which will not end
until that ereat thoroughfare has a pave
ment equal to any in the best administered
citiea of the world.
SAN PEDEO OR SANTA MONICA.
The Government commission which,
under the act of Congress, is to determine
whether a deep-sea harbor for Southern
California shall be located at San Pearoor
Santa Monica, will begin hearing testi
mony next Monday, and the hearings will
be open and public. The issue is one of
great importance to Los Angeles and
hardly less to the State generally, so that
all the proceedings of the commission will
be watched with more than ordinary in
terest.
To the State at large it would matter
very little whether the proposed harbor
were established aj either point in prefer
ence to the other were it not fof the fact
that the port of Santa Monica Would be
almost wholly in the bands of the South
ern Pacific monopoly, while at San Pedro
shippers would have the advantage of a
competing railroad line. It is true the
terms of the act oi Congress appropriating
money lor the harbor provide that if
Santa Monica be selected arrangements
should be made permitting the approach
of other roads to the harbor. This pro
vision, however, while good in itself, is
not nearly so satisfactory as would be the
selection of San Pedro, where competitive
railroads would not need the aid of any
Congressional provision in order to obtain
full facilities for their docks.
It is also a matter of importance to the
State, and indeed to the Nation, that the
harbor selected should be the better and
safer of the two. It would be an act of
folly to expend a large sum of money in
an effort to construct a harbor at a given
point when a better harbor could be con
structed at less cost at a place not re
motely distant. The commission, there
fore, will have to consider not only tho
question of railway facilities at the port
and the avoidance of anything like a
monopoly of dock privileges, but also the
point of safety and convenience to snip
ping.
Tho controversy over the selection of a
site for the harbor has gone on for a long
time, and former surveys made by Gov
ernment officials have always resulted in
the selection of the port of San Pedro.
The recommendations of theso officers
would in all probability have long since
determined the improvement of the har
bor at that point had it not been for the
opposition of the Southern Pacific Rail
road. That company i;avinjr obtained
complete control of Santa Monica has
been most strenuous in its efforts to ob
tain a Government appropriation for a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1896.
harbor there, and as a consequence Los
Angeles has'been compelled to do without
the deep water port for years, because of
the railroad opposition to San Pedro.
This being the situation of affairs the
present commis.-ion will undoubtedly un
derstand the importance of exercising the
fullest care in arriving at a <lecision. It
has done well in deciding to have public
sessions to hear, evidence on both sidi'S.
It should, however, go further than that.
It should make all its proceedings public.
It should conduct its discussions of the
evidence as openly as the hearings them
selves.
The issue involves more than the ex-
penditure of the $3,000,000 whi;h will be
required for the construction of the har
bor. It involves the welfare of a great
section of country, and to some extent
the honor of the Government it>elf. The
commission, therefore, should take no
steps which would raise tne slightest sus
picion of undue favor to the monopoly.
Their decision between tne two ports is
to be final, and it should be just and sat
isfactory to the people.
THE TARIFF DEBATE.
The debate in the Senate on Wednesday
puts an end to all doubt as to the fate of
the Dingley bill. It is now virtually set
tled that the bill in its present shape or
possibly In any shape could not pass a:
this session. It is, therefore, a dead letter
and the subject will not probably be
brought up again in either house during
the continuance of the present Congress.
In the course of the debate speeches
were made by leading representatives of
all sections of the country and of all
parties. With the exception of Senator
Sherman not a single man expressed any
belief that the bill could be passed or any
desire for its passage. Even the Republi
can Senators who favored it last winter
now recognize that the changed condition
of public affairs has made the bill unde
sirable even as a revenue measure.
Senator Gorman expressed the situation
with accuracy in saying Republican Sena
tors have not the power to pass the bill in
its present form, and they have not the
time to remodel it ana make it a Republi
can measure. This being so, the Senator
was undoubtedly right in adding: "It is
trifling with the business interests of the
country to hold out a hope of tariff legis
lation by continuous debate when every
body knows that such actiou is impossi
ble."
To this statement of the Senator from
Maryland Senators Hale of Maine, Platt
of Connecticut and Teller of Colorado
agreed. Senator Sherman, indeed, made
a strong appeal for some kind of tariff
legislation at this session in order to pro
vide the Government with revenue suffi
cient to its needs, but even he did not sug
geot any means of amending the Dingley
bill in a way that would render its ac
ceptance by the Senate at all probable.
The country will agree with Senator
Sherman: "It is a shame and a disgrace
that in a time of profound peace the Gov
ernment has, on account of insufficient
revenue, to issue bonds. 11 It will not
agree with him, however, that the present
Congress bears any of the odium of that
disgrace. The deficit is due to a D mo
cratic tariff iA the first place, and for its
continuance the Democratic administra
tion is alone responsible.
Mr. Cleveland, so far from recommend
ing legislation to increase the revenues,
has, by his last message to Congress, en
couraged the cuckoos and the free-traders
of the Senate to oppose any such measure.
Ou the administration and its supporters,
therefore, rests the whole blame of the sit
uation. The country knowing this cares to
hear no lurtber debate on the issue. Busi
ness and industry now look forward to
an extra session of Congreas, and the best
that this Congress can do will be to let
the tariff alone and go forward to deal
with other issues.

RECRUITING FOR THE NAVY.
Philadelphia Li dger.
It is estimated that about4ooo men will have
to be added to the navy in the next two years
in order to furnish crews for >he new vessels
that will be ready for service in that time.
These must be provided by Congress, as the
limited number allowed by law has been
Almost filled, and the manning of the Puritan
will exhaust the aVÃilab.e lorces. The best
j plan to provide men for the navy would be by
i tin elastic provision of law, whereby men
could be recruited as needed, without requir
ing fresh legislation every time a new ship is
launched or the force, from any cause, becomes
too small. It takes time to drill even able sea
men for the work of the navy, and exigencies
sometimes arise in which time is not to be bad.
If we are 10 become a naval nation we must oe
prepared for all contingencies, and ability to
equip a fleet at short notice is one of these.
The sudden assembling of England's famous

whicli our nation should take to heart.

seeing it. for I have long heard a great, deal
about It. We have been at Los Angeles, San
DieÃo and a number of other places. Their
beauty made a deep impression on me.
"Such novelty I have never found on any
trip. We will be here but a day or two, as the
time has already flown so rapidly that we
must hurry buck to Minneapolis."
The gentleman is said much to resemble his
famous father, who began life as a curate and
became one of the masters of literature.

, It is noteworthy that oi the three score men
who have served fourteen years or longer in
the Senate seventeen hailed : 110 m the six New
England I States. ; It is also somewhat | remark
able that the present contains not only the
man of longest service in the history .of that
body, but another, who will beat the record
made. by Mr. Benton if lives less than a year
longer. Mr". Morrill has been re-elected from
Vermont, and he Is in such good health that
Ms friends have no doubt 01 his living long
enough to eclipse Mr. lie 11 ton's achievement.
If he does do this it will be somewhat remark
able in the annals of public lite, as Mr. Morrill
did not enter the Senate until he was 57 years
old, whereas Mr. Benton was under 40 when
he began his Senatorial career. There is a lit
tle good-natured : rivalry Detween Senators
Sherman and Morrill for the honor of the
record. The Ohio, Senator has the advantage
of .two' years', longer service, but Mr. Mornll
has been continuously in the Senate, while
Mr. Sherman's service was broken by his four
years in the treasury. :

In the matter of determining the question of

which, whenever he is absent, lie lias the in
tention of returning." "Ii a person remove to
another stale with the intention 01 remaining
there for an indefinite time, and as a place of
present re>ideiice, he 10-.es his residence in

CAME UP WITH

The German Ship Othmar
schen Made a Quick
Run.
Came Here From Iquique With
Only 500 Tods ot Stif
fening.
Tbree Vessels Racing Neck and Neck
on a Voyage to English
Ports.
The German ship Othmarschen got in
yesterday after a number of narrow e-capes
from destruction. Captain Selzer showed
his skill as. a navigator and proved that he
was a cool-headed saiior by bringing his
vessel into port in one of the quickest pas
sages on record.
The Othmarschen sailed for Iqoiqoa in
ballast to load nitrate for Europe. When
the vessel was off the port a letter to the
captain was put aboard ordering him to
San Francisco. This made Selzer do
choice cursing (in Germai:), as in anticipa
tion of loading at Iquique he had thrown
overboard 300 tons of his ballast, iv order
to save expenses in removing it when the
vessel was docsed. When the start was
made for San Francisco, therefore, the
Othraarschen was Hying light with only
500 tons of ballast in her hold. Being a
1750-ton vessel, it required careful naviga
tion to bring her Into port. Captain Selzer
bad the upper yards sent down, but never
theless m ade the run to San Francisco in
the very quick time of forty-nine days.
Off the port he ran into a southeaster, and
set just enough canvas to keep the ship
head reaching until a tug came along and
brought tne ship into port. The Othmar-
BChen will luud wheat for Europe.
The Harbor Commissioners held quite a
lengthy session yesterday. The ferry de
pot came up for discussion, and the mat
ter ot the terminus of the Valley road in
China Basin was referred to ttie attorney.
In the ferry depot case several changes, as
recommended by the architect, were or
dered made, but in the other case there
was some discussion. President Ceinon
said that according to report the Valley
road had sold its richts in China Basin.
He thought there was a misunderstanding
somewhere, as the land in question was
only leased to the Vailey road on
certain conditions. He would like to
know if the road had complied with the
conditions of the contract. Commissioner
Cole wanted to know if the directors of the
road had madti any improvements, and
Chief Engineer Holmes said that some
tiles had been driven.
On the motion of Commissioner Cole
the board's attorney was instructed to look
into the matter and report at Tuesday's
meeting. The Commissioners think that
Ihe retorted transler of the Valley road's
inte.est in China basin is a canard.
Goodall, Perkins & Co. complained about
the state of Spear-street wharf. Ii is all
hills and hollows, and a few days ago one
of the carters-was thrown from his wagon
and a load of paper was thrown on top of
him. He was not seriously injured. Tne
matter was referred to the superintendent
oi urgent repairs:
The question ol creosoted piles came up
â and the contractors were allowed $1 a pile
extra for the work entailed in hauling the
timbers out of the water, then barking
lhem and putting them backa^ain. Chief
Engineer Holmes explained -that even
under the proposed advance the company
was losing money, but Mr. Dundon, presi
dent of the creosoting works, said he was
willing to lose a certain amont on every
contract in order to get the process thor
oughly tested. Afterward President Col
non expressed himself a? of the opinion
thai had creosoted piles been used in the
construction of all the State wharves
enough money would have been saved to
build the rest of the seawall.
Captain Baron of the Eve-Ham Abbey,
which arrived Wednesday night, wants to
get a boat into to-morrow's regatta. He
has an unusually good boat's crew and is

The captains, officers and men of the
warthips and sailing vessels that anchor
off Foisom-street wharf are clamoring for
an electric light at the landing-place.
When there is no moon the place is the
most d icmal spot on the front, and saiiors
avoid it. A petition to the Harbor Com
missioners to have a light placed near the
float is now being signed, and the chances
are that the much needed change will be
made.

DINED ON TATIES
AND HAGGIS
Caledonians and Their La
dies Gather Round the
Festive Board.
One of the Most Fnjayable
Events in the History of the
Organization.
Special Referencs Made to the Fro
posed Monument to Robert
Burns-
The thirty-first annual reunion and
banquet of the Caledonian Club, held in
Scottish Hall last night, was an immense
success in every respect. The hall was
filled with members of the ciub and their
ladies and quests, who all spent a most
delicbttul evening.
Among those present were:
Chief D. R. McNeill, Miss Viva C. McNeil],
Frank T. Shea, Jeremiah Deasy, W. Watson,
Dr. D. Maclean, Dr. G. S BacJcman, James T.
McDonald, James A. McKav and wife, Captain
McNeil and wife, William McKay, Colin M.
Boyd, Mr. and Mrs. John McLaren, J. McNab,
Mr. and Mrs. James Scobie. Mr. and Mrs. John
Reid, Mr. and Mrs. George Davidson, Miss Jen
nie Davidson, Miss Jennie Brown. Golonel C.
L. Taylor. Jonn W. McGUvray, Mr. and Mrs
Andrew McNair, Mr. and Mrs. W. C. < oi/lt,
Mr. and Mrs. Meredith, Sergeant John
Duncan and wife. Mr. and Mrs. John
M. Duncan, Sergeant T. W. Bethel),
Robert 8. Duncan, Mr. and Mrs. James Dun
can, Miss Elsie Duncan, Miss Jennie Duncan,
Mr. aud Mrs. William Xichol. Mr. and Mrs. Y.
C. Lawsen, James McLea, Miss Belle McLea,
Miss Edith Henderson. Mr. and Mrs. George
Uetbune, Miss Faunie R.godia.
Toe hall was tastefully draped with
bunting and above the chief and the prin
ciDal guests was displayed the Scottish
flag with lions rampant and on each side
the stars and stripes.
During the evening special reference
was made by several of the speakers re
garding the proposition to erect a monu
ment to Scotland's bard, Robert Burns, in
Golden Gate Park, and each reference to
ttie subject was greeted with rousing
clieers, which augurs well for the consume
matlon of the scheme. It was announced
by Chief McNeill that it will be formally
taken up and discussed at the regular
meeting of the club next month.
After the company had assembled the
formal installation of the officers was
made by Colonel C. L. Tayior as follows:
Chief, D. R. McNeill; first chief tain, John
Reid; second chieftain, George Davidson;
third chieltain, James H. Duncan; fourth
chieftain, John W. Cameron; physician,
Dr. J. A. J. McDonald.
Alter the installation ceremony the mas
ter of ceremonies, ex-Chief Angus Mc
.Leod requested Chief McNeill to make a
presentation to George Mitchell, the retir
ing fourth chieftain. The chief, in a
few well-chosen words, presented to Mr.
Mitchell a beautiful diamond ring from
the club as a toKen of its appreciation of
his four years' services as financial secre
tary, and the recipient made a suuuuie
reply.
*Tui* ended the business part of the pro
ceedings, and the company sat down to
the festive board. The menu was up to
the usual high standard of the Cale
donians, and included the "haggis," its
appearance, preceded by Piper Neil Lind
say, being greeted with rounds of ap
plause. Then "hot Scotch" was brought
on the table and the literary part of the
programme was commenced.
Chief McNeill in his address spoke of
the objects and aims of the club and its
success in the past year. It was the in
tention of the officers to carry on the good
work, and their cry would be upward and
onward.
"We have now," said the chief, "ar
rived at a period when thee is nothing
particular to do as a club. We have a hall
of our own and a satisfactory income.
What, then, shall we do with our money
and time?
4 "Individually most of us have ample
use for both, but as a club we have noth
ing special on hand. This brings up tne
suggestion made several years ago by ex-
Chief Colin M. Boyd, to erect a monu
ment in Golden Gate Park to Scotland's
sweetest bard, . nay the world's sweetest
bard, Robbie Burns [cheers]. lam much
pleased at the cordial manner in
which you have received the sugges
tion, which confirms me in the be
lief that if the Caledonian Club
makes up its Caledonian mind the monu
ment will be erected. If the club once
takes hold of it it will have, I feel sure,
plenty of a-sistance as Rouble Burns is
dear to the heart of every one that loves
the sweet and beautiful in nature, and is
especially dear to the big, liberty loving
heart of the American people.
The toast list was then taken up. "The
President of the United States" and "The
Queen" were toasted with ail the honors.
"The Land We Live In" was responded to
in a neat speech by John D. McGilvray ;
â¢'The Pres?," by Arthur H. Barendt;
"The City of San Francisco," by
Coin M. Boyd; "Sister Societies,"
by Frank T. Shea, president of
the Knights of St. Patrick, and "The Las
sie*," by Joseph M. Camming. Rev. Dr.
H. C. Minton was to have replied to the
toast of "The Land o' the Heather," but
sent a note regretting His inability to
attend.
After the regular list was finished vari
ous speeches were made and sonjrs were
rendered by W. C. Cook, Andrew McNair
and others.
The success of the event was mainly due
to the reception committee, composed of:
John Reid (chairman), Y. C. Lawson,
William Mitchell, James Millar, W. C.
Cook, James McNab, Robert Sutherland,
William Urquhart and Peter Mclntyre.

FAVOR PAYING
FOR THE CITY MAP
Supervisors Think That the
Labor Performed War
rants It.
All Valid Objections Have Been
Heard and Carelully
Considered.
Mayor Su!ro Said to Be an Interested
Party in the fight Against Its
Acceptance.
la spite of the objections of the
Grand Jury and the San Francisco
Association of Improvement Clubs
and private parties who have protested
against the acceptance by the Supervisors
o! the new City map, the Street Comrov
tee of the board nas decided to recom
mend that the map be paid for at once.
Surveyor Tilton took a contract to fur
nish trie map for $10,000, and when his
work was completed to his own satisfac
tion presented a demand to the Supervi
sors for the contract price. Mayor Sutro
objected to the payment of tbe $10,000
until the map shouki be examined and
reported on by experts, and succeeded in
getting a delay of thirty days in the mat
tar.
During the past month experts from the
Grand Jury and the Ansociation of Im
provement CluDs have examined the map,
and both orsauizatious have sent com
munications to the board protesting
against the payment of the price on ihe
ground that the work is incomp.ete and
inaccurate.
The Street Committee heard Surveyor
Tilton on the suuject of the map yester
day, and after his explanation, instructed
Clerk Rus>ell to prepare the following
repurt for tbe consideration of tJm board
on Monday next:
The official map has been open for inspection
for thiny days, and all valid objections have
been considered, and some omissions have
been delineated. Various questions have been
raised as to certain delineations and the
boundaries of certain tracts. All of these 6b
jentions are such as require a legal determina
tion, and must certaltuy remain in abeyance
until adjudicated by tne courts. Such being
the fact, it would be oppressive and unjust, in
the opinion of your committee, ;o defer pÂ«y
. NEW. TO-DAY. .
How is your grocer oi
Schilling's Best tea ?
.". Does he sell it? Does
he money-back it without
grumbling?
Drop us a line if you
have any trouble getting
the tea or your money back
if you don't like it.
. A Schilling & Company

ment lor the map until those questions are
deiermined, might be for years.
Your committee, therefore, reports that after
examination and consideration of the objec
tions made, oral and otherwise, they appear in
som- instances to be ba^ed on a disposition to
acquire public property or to create an un
warranted confusion in the measurement and
lines of our streets and highways for personal
gain or advantage.
In view of the labor bestowed upon the map
your coiEminee reeoipinends that the map be
accepted and the authorization objected to by
the Mayor for payment be passed, notwith
standing the objections of his Honor, one o:
the most interested parties in the controversy.
The payment is made for the mep completed
accordisig to the official data. The City En
giueer has also volunteered to make all
changes which may be required by the board
on decisions affecting any locations without
further cost or charge, and no more could De
expected.
It is expected that the committee's re
port will be accepted and that Surveyor
Tilton will receive the money at once.
CAUSES OF SEVERAL DEATHS.
Coroner Hawkins Holds Inquests on
Four Suicide Cases.
Coroner Hawkins was kept very busy
yesterday holding inquests upon the
bodies of those who recently met with
violent deaths. A verdict of suicide was
returned by the jury in ihe case of J. G.
Locke, a student, at 2328 Folsom street,
who cut his throat in Golden Gate Park a
week ago.
A similar verdict was returned in the
case of James Hamel, a carpenter living
at 3422 Eighteenth street. Gil December
12 he ended his life by turning on the gas.
\V. J. Trewella became despondent and
planed the muzzle of a shotgun to his
heart and pressed the tripger with his foot.
He lived iv the Wisconsin Hotel on .Pacific
street. A verdict based on tLese facts was
given by tne jury.
The Coroner's jury was not satisfied
with the circumstances surrounding the
deatn of Mrs. Belle McCarthy of 246 How
ard street, who died in the branch County
Jail of natural causes on the 13th inst. In
its verdict the jur3 f severely commented
upon the fact tnat the woman had no
medical attention from the time she be
came ill, 8 p. m., to the time of her death,
at 2a. m the next morning.

tions Are to Be
Benefited.

$100,000, for St. Ignatius
College.
J Downey Harvey and Mrs. Martin
Get Millionsâ Baroness Yon Schroe
der Almost Ignored.
The will of the late Annie Donahue,
widow of Peter Donahue and mother of J.
Mervyn Donahue, has been hied for pro
bate. It is an elaborate instrument, deal
ing explicitly with all the affairs of the
testator. The will was prepared by Mrs.
Donahue with great care and the executors
named are Eleanor Martin, J. Downey
Harrey and Alexander H. Lough borough,
the latter being one of the testator's legal^
advisers for many years.
It is estimated that the estate will
amount to not less than $5,000,000.
The instrument bears date of May 17,
1895. It provides liberally for advancing
the interests of religious and charitable
objects and institution's, besides bestow
ing rich legacies on relatives. Baroness
yon Schroeder, stepdaughter of the de
ceased, is not so liberally remembered as
â  was expected, and some of the younger
relatives are to receive their shares
througn their parents.
Tne first public object mentioned in the
will is St. Ignatius College, to the trustees
of which is bequeathed $100,000 for ihe
formation of a library to De called the
Donahue Library, in memory of her hus
band. It is to De free to Catholic youns
men. For helping to care for the library
an additional $5000 is granted.
Tiie fifth paragraph of the will is of
interest to a great many public institu
tions, as the sum of $100,000, while be
queathed to Archbishop Kiordan, is
evidently intended to be distributed in
accordance with the expressed wish of the
testator in these words:
I give s nrt bequeath to the Most Reverend
Patrick Wil.iam Riordnn, :it present Roman

I would gladly leave a lar?e part of my es

STRANGLED TO DEATH.
Suicide of Mrs. Anna >T. Hoffmann
\thile Suffering From Melan
cholia.
Mrs. Anna Marguerita Hoffmann com
mitted suicide in a most shocking man
ner in the French Hospital on Wednesday
evening. She straneied herself lo death
with a smail cord. Mrs. Hoffmann was a
resident of Santa Cruz, and for the past
three months she had been confined in the
hospital, suffering from melancholia.
At times she showed suicidal inclina
tions and said she wanted to die, but she
never made an attempt to do so. How
she got the cord is not known. The
woman was a native of Germany and the
mother of a family. She was 66 years of
age.
Coroner Hawkins was much displeased
that the hospitai people should not have
reported the case at once, and he had a
letter sent to tne management warning
them not to violate the law again.
BELT RAILROAD PLAN.
The Subject of Kxteimion Will Come
Before the Chamber of Com
merce.
The subject of the seawall and belt rail
road extension came up before the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday afternoon and
after some discussion went over till the
next meeting of the trustees. January 12.
President Colnon of the State Harbor
Commission advocates the floating of
$1,000,000 in bonds to complete the work
from the ferry slips, the present ter
minus, to Channel street, the work to be
done in five sections at an expenditure of
$200,000 per section.
Mr. Colnon contends that by issuing
bonds and prosecuting the work as fast as
the requirements of commerce would
permit enough land would be reclaimed
every year to cover the interest on the in
vestment by the rent which it would
bring in. It is estimated by the chief
engineer of the Harbor Commission that
luliy 450,000 square feet will be reclaimed
when the work is finished. Another con
sideration which is urged in support of
the proposition is that the rock and sand
iilling will take the piace6f the piling and
planking and do away with tbe continual
expense of repairs, and this savine alone
would amount to nearly twice the inierest
on the bonds.
The board asks that the Chamber of
Commerce and other commercial ftodies
in this City assist in inducing the Legis
lature to grant the power to issue bonds
subject to the approval of the people at
the general election a year from next
November. They hoid that if tde sea wall
is not extended in this way, the chances
are that the work will remain in its
present uncompleted state for twenty
years.
President Colnon also calls the atten
tion of the Chamber of Commerce to the
fact that at present there are only two
places where stiip and car can come to
getherâat the Pacific Mail dock, where
the Southern Pacific trains come down on
the front, and at Lombard-street wharf,
where the trains aie ferried across from
Sausalito, Tiburon and Oakland and are
landed onto the belt tracks. Between
these distant points lies a long stretch of
wharves constantly crowued with ship-
I ing that are without the conveniences of
a railroad.
It is believed that the plan of the Board
of State Harbor Commissioners will he
favored by the Chamber of Commerce of
this City and tfcat body may recommend
tbe passage of an act to hasten the pro
posed wors.

HIS LEG WAS CRUSHED.
| An Interesting Admiralty Cage in the
District Court.
The attention of United States District
| Judge Morrow was engaged ail day yester
day hearing the testimony in the action
of Lou's A. Peterson, who seeks to recover
$^0,000 damages from J. D. Spreckela <fc
Bros.
According to the complaint, the plain
tiff was a mate on the little schooner S.
Danielson. In January, 1895, the schooner
was engaged at Santa Rosa Island, off
Santa Barbara, carrying wreckage from
the Brilisi ship Crown of England, that
! was wrecked on tbe island.
The tueboat Vigilant was an attendant
j upon ihe Danielson and the schooner
I Annie in the wrecking expedition, and
! towed them between the wreck and the
{ landing on the e:ist side of ttie island.
| One Sunday morning t c Vigilant had the
i l);::iielron in tow in the Santa Uarbara
i ChatuiM.
The mate Peterson was forward wrap
ping the laive hemp hawser with canvas
to prevent it chafing in the docks. He
was astride of the hawser and the chock
broke. The hawser whipped across the
rail and taught Peterson, throwing him
against the capstan with great force. His
I n?ht leg was so badly crushed that it had
to t>e amputated. In fact it had to be am
putated four times in order to save the
j man's life. In the complaint Peterson
j charged the master and crew of the Vigi
â  lant with carelessness in towing the
j schooner too rapidly through the channel.
The defendants, by their attorneys Del
i m.is & Short ridge, filed an answer in
I wh'ch they denied the charges of careless
ness and neglect, and denieu all resDonsi
biliiy for the unfortunate accident to
Peterson, who, it was stated, was person
! ally careless in standing astride of a
j hawser attached to a tug. In the hearing
of the case yesterday Samuel M. Short
ridge conducted the defense for the de
fendant.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1896.
BROWNIES DANCE
AT THE BALDWIN
Palmer Cox' Production Re
ceived by a Large
Audience.
"The Brownies" Proves to Be a
Glittering Pantomime Which
Wins Much Applause.
The Little Peop c's Roles Are Taken
by Grown-Up Actors â S?me
Good Specialties.
An audience that filled the Baldwin and
overflowed into the foyer welcomed Palmer
Cox's "Brownies" last night. A number
of children were present, and the perform
ance seemed to give equal satisfaction to
the youngsters and the adults.
"The Brownies" is a scenic extravaganza,
something like an old-fash ior.ed English
pantomime, minus the harlequinade. It
abounds with glittering scenery and
costumes, pretty eirls, gorgeous light
effects, sprightly dances and up-to-date
songs and jokes.
Taken altogether tbe larÂ»e company
which interprets the "Brownies" is clever
and efficient. The music is light and
catchy and the story o f bow the demon
Dragon fel stole Queen Titania and how
the Brownies rescued her is effective for
extravaganza purposes.
The disappointment in the performance
lies in the Brownies themselves. ' The gen
tlemen who enact their parts are life-size
actors, made up in imitation of Palmer
Cox's famous illustrations, but white
circles round their eyes, spindle
limbs and pumpkin - like bodies
cannot give actors the quaint vivacity
and grotesqueness which mark every line
of Palmer tox's illustrations, and it would
be asking the impossible to expect that
mere makeup would produce a Brownie.
However, the gentlemen who essay the
difficult task of bringing Cox' drawings
to life do their work as cleverly as could
be expected.
The dramatis person* are by no means
all Brownies. There are fairies, demons,
sprites and mythological personages, but
no mortals stray into the extravaganza.
The first act shows how Dragonfel, an
evil spirit, enslaves and prevents the
marriage of Titania, the Jairy queen, with
Florimel, the neirapparent to tne Brownie
throve.
He invokes the aid of Vulcan, and ac
companied by sprites sent for the occa
sion by the forger of Jove's thunderbolts,
he interrupts the wedding and carries off
the queen. The second act passes in
Dragonfel's palace, where Titania, as a
prisoner, is entertained by a number of
stecialties.
Finally the Brownies obtain admission,
disguised as a German band, and are
about to receive the Queen, when Vulcan
comes to the rescue of his demon friend
and the Brownies have to remain in dur
ance vile till a Russian anarchist Brownie
throws a bombshell which destroys Drag
onfel. and the curtain drops at the end of
the third act on the happy union of Flori
rnel and Titania.
I. la Mulle as the spinster fairy is one
of the most "fetching" characters in tbe
performance. Soe is quaint enough to be
a real Brownie. FranK Deshon make a
fairly humoious Brownie King and his
song with the "Ting a ling" chorus was
encored repeatedly. Sol Solomon caused
plenty of mirth as the leader of the
Brownie 400.
The Prince and Titania were lacking in
the dash and vim that one generally asso
ciutes with roles such as these, but the utter
absence of the music hall style was com
pensated for by a repose and refinement
ihnt are rarely found in princes and
princesses on the extravaganza stage.
Titania's singing was encored.
Little Gertie Carlisle danced charmingly
and sang with her usual spirit. She is tne
premiere dansease of the troupe. The
Brownies danced with vigor and the ladies
of the Oriental ballet posed prettily, but
tue.v did not dance much.
The aerial ballet was a picturesque pro
duction, in which fairies did a son of Loie
Fuller "turn" in midair.
The Brownie German band aroused
roars of laughter and Newhouse and
Waffle as minstrels played the mandolin
and guitar excellently.
Taken altogether "The Brownies" was a
decided success.
FRESNO'S MODEL
BICYCLE TRACK
A Three- Lap Mile Course,
to Be Called "The
Trachydome."
Elaborate Preparations Made for
Its Formal Opening To-
Morrow.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 17.â Fresno is to
have a modern bicycle Irack, which local
scholars in Greek have named tbe
"Tiachydome." It is a three-lap mile
course and is being constructed particu
larly for racing. It will be finished by
next Saturday, when the greatest race
meet ever held in the San Joaquin Vaihy
will take place on it. The preparations
for this big affair are being enthusiastically
carried out by tbe local wheelmen, and is
bound to be a success in every way.
The new track is situated just norlh of
the city in Eelmont addition, and is about
a mile from the business center. It is con
nected with the main portion of the city
by a streetcar line, and every convenience
desired is afforded. Inside the track tbe
ground will be laid out for football, base
ball, cricket and other field sports.
The Trachydome is being constructed
according to the most improved plans. It
will be a fast track and will piece Fresno
to tbe front among wheelmen as one of
the racing centers in tne State. A nine
foot board fence is being erected around
the ground.", and as soon as enough money
is realized from races a grand stand will be
built.
The project of constructing the Trachy
dome was conceived among the local
spor'ing men only a few weeks ago. It
was taken in hand by several prominent
ritizecs and in a few days they rÂ«iÂ«ed
$1000 among the business men" of the
C.ty with wliicb to lease tho/grounds and
construct the bicycle course ana board
fence. The promoters have received e eery
They are uot working for any individual
gain, but in the interest of outdoor sports.
As soon 83 the grounds are finished they
wiil be turned over to the Athletic Club,
the Athletic Wheelmen's Annex, the
Kaisin City Cyclers and the Englishmen's
cricket club. "These will have full charge
of the grounds and all events that take
place thereon. Any pecuniary gain will
go toward these organizations.
The board iencs around the spacious
grounds is nearly up and several teams
are energetically at work on the track so
us to have it ready for the races next Sat
urday. The course will be in pood shape
and every opportunity is promised, barr
ine the weather, although it is reasona
bly expected to be fine, for the making of
fast time.
The race-meet will be, held under the
auspices of the Raisin City Cycles. Sev
eral ol the fastest men on the coast will be
down from San Francisco to participate,
and every rider of any speed iii the valley
has entered for some event.
A number ol the Stale officials of the L.
A. W. will be among the visitors. R. M.
Welch, chairman of the Pacific Coast
Rncmg Board and also member of the Na
tional Board, will attend and probably
act as referee. F. B\ K/rrigan, chief con
sul of the L. A. W.. and R. E. Smyth, ihe
official bandicapper, will also be here.
This will be the first race-meet of any
consequence held in the valiey, and the
local wheelmen are taking great interest
in it.

A CHANCE FOR THE
NEW BUILDING
Proceedings So Far Were
All in Accordance
With Law.
Why Mayor Sutro May Sign
tbe Hall of Justice
Contract.
There Was a Declaration by the Board
of Supervisors of a Public
Need.
When Mayor Sutro's objections to sign
ing the contract for the Hull of Justice, as
prepared by Attorney Rogers, are pre
sented to the Board of Supervisors they
will, figuratively speaking, be knocked
into a cocked hat.
The matter was informally discussed at
the meeting of tha Street Committee of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday, and
plain evidence was found in the records of
the board to show that the Mayor and his
attorney did not go far enough into tbe
matter before coming to a conclusion.
Mr. Rogers based his main- objection on
the section of the statutes which provides
that where a tax levy for improvements is
made there must be a declaration that
there is a public need for the improve
ment.
He stated that the board had neglected
in all of its proceedings relative to the Hal
of Justice to declare that the building was
a matter of public need and benefit.
' Clerk Russell stated yesterday that the
Mayor's objection, basad on the opinion
rendered, would not hold water for a mo
ment, because the new hall had been de
clared a public need according, to the law
and that he had proof of it.
. In support of his statement he produced
the latest municipal reports and referred
to the proceedings originally taken to in
sure the building of the Kearny-street mu
nicipal structure. -
There was a resolution passed by the
board on July 22, 1895, that appears to
cover the entire matter. It reads as fol
lows: ' â â  ' â¢â â â â â¢â¢â  'â â  i : ' ?â¢Â£*'Â£:? / - v
RESOLUTION 13696 (THIRD SERIES).
Resolved, TTiat this board deems it expedient
and hereby declares that in its judgment tne
public good requires the construction of a
suitable building ,on the old City Hall lot for
the accommodation of the criminal depart
ments of the Superior Court, Police Courts,
stations, prison. Morgue, Coroner's office and
other municipal uses.
And the clerk is hereby directed to adver
tise this resolution as required Dy law. â 
In Board of Supervisors, San Francisco. July
22. 1895.
Adopted by the following. vote:
Ayesâ Supervisors King, Scully, Benjamin,
Hirsch, Dimond, Hughes, Dunker, Taylor,
Morgenstern, Spreckels, Hobbs, Wagner.
Thu9 it appears that the Mayor's stum
bling-block to signing the contract is re
moved, and that the matter will go
through without a hitch.
"We don't do things of that kind in this
office without carefully observing the
law," said Clerk Russell, "and while I have
not looked into tbe other objections ureed
by the Mayor I have no doubt that they
will be cleared up after a careful investi
gation."

ON THE SLATE
Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr.
to Be Mayor Phelan's
Secretary.
Sam Rainey and the County
Committeemen Will Divide
Big Patronage.
Frank L. Coombs and the Assembly
Committees â Three-Cornered
Fight for Chief Clerk.
Wi P. Sullivan Jr., formerly colonel of
the First Infantry Regiment, N. G. C.
and latterly an active exponent of Demo
.cratic doctrines in the municipul election,
has his name on the slate for secretary ot
Mayor Pbelan. Tbe name is said to have
been written with an indelible pencil and
cannot be easily erased. The office is a
good one. The duties are not arduous and
the compensation is $250 a month.
Colonel Sullivan was a popular colonel,
And his friends assert that he will become
a popular secretary. One of the duties of
the position is to explain to the aged and
indigent the easiest way to get to the
Almshouse, and another important func
tion is to bring into play the influence of
the Mayor to effect the release of pet dogs
from the Pound.
Mayor Phelan, it is assumed, will have
another place to bestow. Courtesy accords
to him the naming of one janitorâ pre
sumabiy the one that takes care of the
Mayor's office. In an aggravated contest
for the spoils Sam Rainey might take this
little plum by force, but there is no indi
cation that he intends to violate cour
tesies honored by precedent.
Tbe hundred or more places, such as
janitors, watchmen, Prosecuting Attor
neys, Police Court clerks, etc., which the
Supervisors appoint, will be divided
â¢ equally between Sam Rainey ana the
Democratic County Committeemen of the
respective Assembly districts. For exam
pie, Sam will name one and then the
Assembly district representative will
name tbe second, and so on along theline.
This arrangement may give fifty places to
Rainey and fifty to the Assembly distiicts.
What the Supervisors will get themselves
is not now clearly shown.
Current rumor goes that Mayor Phelan
is not in the deal. He will have the honor
of presiding at the meetings of the board
and the pleasure of signing warrants per
mitting Rainey's men and others to draw
money from tlie treasury.
Just before Mayor Phelan's term of
office expires he will have an opportunity
10 appoint a Gas Inspector to succeed
Colonel Taylor, who was recently ap
pointee".
Frank L. Coombs, ex-United States
M.nister to Japan, was in the City yester
uaj\ It seems to be conceded all around
that he will be elected Speaker of the As
. sembly. Judge Way mire is on the slate
for chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
Tie chairmanship of the Ways and Means
Committee is unsettled. Judge Henry C.
Dibble was at the head of that committee
during tbe first session of the Legislature
under Governor Marunam's administra
tion. Mr. Coombs was then Speaker of
the Assembly. Now it is rumored that the
prospective Speaker has in mind for the
place an Assemblyman from Southern
California, Mr. Guy. Judge Dibble has a
strong following in the Grand Army,
which be may not invoke for so small an
affair as the chairmanship oi an Assem
bly committee. It is said that he would
prefer to use such influence with his com
rade Major McKinley to obtain an agreea
ble appointment in the diplomatic service.
Tnere will be a tnree-cornered fight for
chief clerk of the Assembly. Tiie an
nounced candidates are: T. E. Atkinson
of San. Francisco, S. J. Duckworth of Mon
terey and W. HawKett of Alameda. In
times past the Southern Pacific lobby
managed to cut quite a figure in tne se
lection of chief clerk of the Assembly, but
word nas now come from headquarters in
the yellow building tuat the corporation
will not help or hinder any candidate.
Each man will stand on his merits and
the most capable clerk may win out.
CON MOONEY'S WILDCAT.
The Beast Has teen Knocked Out by
Brawny "Brick" Mcl'hersnn.
Con Mooney's wildcat is becoming a
terrible nuisance around the City Prison.
The ferocious feline stands fourteen
inches high in the rear and is over a yard
long from stem to stern. There is some
lynx in him, as can be seen in his power
ful bead and jaws. All these qualifica
tions go to make him an object of admira
tion to the visitors at the jail, but it is the
undeniable wild odor that accompanies
the cat that the prison-keepers object to.
The cat in bis cage has been in the cor
ridor between the main office and the
trustees' dormitory since Monday morn
ing, and tbe place smells like the lowest
grade circus menagerie at early morning.
Last Sunday Con Mooney, the old-time
cock-aiid-dofc-hght promoter, invited a
score of friends, at so much a head, to
witness a fight he was goiug to pull off
between a Calaveras wildcat weighing ap
proximately twenty-eiebt pounds and a
brindle bull terrier from Barney Rilev's
kennel, weighing twenty-five pounds. The
scene of conflict was to be at Cassidy's
fieven-mile House, just beyond the San
Mateo County boundary line.
The police and other officers were on
hand as early as any one else and started
out to capture the principals in the affair.
After several hours' chasing and dodging
Sheriff Kenney of San Mateo drove the
crowd back over the line to the old Mis
sion road, where Con Mooney's horse
"balked and permitted Officer Holbrook
to reach him. Mooney was placed under
arrest, and the cage and wildcat in the
wagon were taken as evidence. It is this
same cat tbat is creating all the distress
about tbe City Prison, the regular prop
erty clerk having refused to accept him.
Mooney's case will come up before
Judge Low this morning If he is con
victed the police fear that they will still
remain custodians of tbe cat, but if he is
liberated he may take the animal and be j
welcome to it. . . 1
There is but one man besides Louis j
Ohnimus, formerly with Woodward's
Gardens, who can handle this cat, and
tbat is A. W. McPherson, better known as
"Brick." , ,
Ohnimus' time is taken up at the park
lake and McPnerson may be called upon
to handle the vicious beast if necessary.
Last Sunday when the cat was taken in
charge nnd placed in the Seven-eentn
street station no one could approach
nearer than ten feet from the ca c until
McPherson, passing the place, stepped in
to see what was noing on.
"That cat's starved," ne said, and pro
curing a piece of liver, he volunteered to
feed it. The cat made a few vicious
lunges and then quieted down. Having
eaten everything in sight the cat leaped at
the netting of his cave as if to sieze the
hand that had led him. He almost broke
through. As he made another lunge Mc-
Pherson smote ihe brute with his list with
such force the snarling animal retired to
thfl furthest corner.
After that when McPherson called on
the cat at the City Prison it snarled as
usual, but remained away from the bars
or grating.
RICHMOND'S STEADY GAIN.
Exchange of Keal Estate and New
Buildings ludictte Confidence in
This Section.
The Richmond residents are not indulg
ing just now in the luxury of electric
lights on their streets, but yet the section
ia advancing aionsr the line of steady
progress and improvements.
Day by day lots are bought and sold and
new buildings are beinc contracted for.
John Wilson, the boatswain of the reve
nue cutter Corwin, has just finished a neat
new cottage on Third avenue, and as a
proof of his intention of making good
use of his new home he notified his neigh
bors of that fact on last Wednesday night
by hiring a band of music to enliven the
occasion and to celebrate his marriage to
Miss Kitty Fennigan, one of the Richmona
society belies.
In addition to this new cottsge, B. I.
Taylor has contracted with E. H. Forst
for a $5000 residence on Twentieth avenue,
between Clement street and Point Lobos
avenue.
T. G. Parker, the Richmond real estate
asem, has, during the past weeK, trans
ferred a lot on Clement street and Fourth
av?nue to L. Levy for $1200, and to Mrs.
Crosscut one on Twenty-iourth avenue and
Point Lobos avenue for $1800. T. La
massey also sought the same agent to
purchase a lot on Second avenue, between
Clement and California streets. In the
same locality Mrs. Mary Muller purchased
a lot for $1200 through the same source.
These figures, Mr. Parker states, are con
siderable of an advance oa prices offered
lor corresponding properties one year ago.
The old racecourse is now one level
body of ground, with streets and avenues
marked over its surface, and sewers are
being put in. Sisth avenue, between Lake
and Clement streets, is graded and
macadamized. The same sort of improve
ment is being applied to Lake street,
between Fifth and Sixth avenues.
Twelfth avenue, between Clement and
California, is also improved.
Point Lobos avenue is one sheet of red
mud and dirt, the accumulation of refuse
and sweepings for years, as this thorough
fare has never had the benefit of being
scratched by the ptreet-sweeper going over
its surface. This neglect will be obviated
if the Richmond Improvement Club can
induce the next Legislature to take Point
Lobos avenue from the care of the Park
Commissioners and place it under the
control of tbe Supervisors, where, the resi
dents say, it justly belongs.
Additional hall and lodgeroom accom
modation will be provided for clnbs and
societies by improvements about to be
done by P. M. Flugger, proprietor of the

FUNDS TO BE RAISED.
The Committee of Fifty After Money
to Fight the Fundin; Bill at
Washington.
It was decided yesterday at the meeting
of tbe Committee of Fifty to begin at
once to raise funds to fight the funding
bill in "Washington. Those present were
Mayor Sutro, Messrs. Monteith, Coward,
Thompson, Fitch, Doyle, Truman, Pop
per. Barry, Leggett, Menzies, Phelan,
Brittain and Scott. The meeting was
held behind closed doors.
The matter of finances was broached
and Max Popper said that the sinews of
war were absolutely necessary. He offered
to subscribe $100 and James D. Phelan at
once added $500 to start the iund. Each
memDer <vas appointed a separate com
mittee to raise money within the next
nve days.
George K. Fitch reported tbat he had
conferred with Senator White about the
coming battie before Congress and had
been told that literary, ammunition wotttd
do good work, and that some kind of a
warning.against the nefarious schemes of
the railroad should be sent to each
member.
Mayor Sutro was appointed a commitee
of one to formulate a plan of campaign to
be submitted at tne next meeting.
FAIR ESTATE PEES.
Judge Slack lias Been Asked to Allow
Them.
Judge Slack was yesterday asked to
allow some Christmas money to the
special administrators and attorneys in
the James G. Fair estate, which is esti
mated to be worth $17,300,000.
The special administrators were modest
and asked the court to fix their fees.
Likewise tbe lawyers felt backward
about coming forward, bnt at last Judge
Slack drew out of them a suggestion that
1 per cent all around would be about
right. The idea was mentioned by ex-
Judge Paterson, attorney for Herman
Oelrich's minor son.
Considerable sums have already been
distributed among the special adminis
trators. They think they are entitled to
$100,000 each. This will allow a balance
of not less than $50,000 each to W. S. Good
fellow, James Angus and Tnomas G.
Crothers.
As for the lawyers, the firm of Pierson
& Mitchell, composed of W. M. Pierson
and R. B. Mitchell, will receive $100,000,
and Garret McEnerney is to have $50,000.
L. C. Bresse, who was appointed one of
the special administrators, died some
time ago. His estate will receive a sum
commensurate with his term of service.
Judge Slack took the matter under ad
visement. It is believed that he will
allow ihe fees for the'lull sum suggested,
as there appears to be no opposition, and
the claims are by some of the heirs re
garded as reasonable.

Kule as to Exhibits.
Judge Belcher yesterday made the following
order: "Hereafter in this department of the Stl
peiior Court, at the conclusion of a trial,
whether the verdici. be one of acquittal orcon
viction, the clerk of the court is ordered to
fiend all the exhibits in the case to the prop
erty clerk of ihe Police Department of this
City nnd County to abide the further order of
the court or till needed in the trial of tho
cause. This order Is made applicable to all
cases pending or concluded. In each Instance
the clerk of she court will take Irom the prop
erty clerW his receipt and file the same with
the papers in the case. " It is understood that
the order has originated from tbe disappear
ance of a photograph which was an exhibit in
the Carl yon Tledetnann case in one of the
Superior courts.
Mary Tarpey's Death.
Autopsy Physician Dr. Charles L. Morgan,
attached to the Morgue, has held an autopsy
upon the body of Mary Theresa Tarpey ot
2820 Greenwich street, and found that death

who just before her death made a confession
in which she charged Nicholas Brennnn with
havinc caused her disgrace. Brennan is now
under arrest.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1896.
FOUNDER OF A
GREAT JOURNAL
General C. H. Taylor of the
Boston Globe on a
Visit Here.
Always a Field for a Paper, He
Says, if the Right Man
Is in the Olfice.
Color Pictures Are the Coming Thing.
Indications cf Great Prosperity
by Spring.
General Charles H. Taylor, proprietor
of the Boston Globe, the great morning
daily of New England, arrived here yes
terday, accompanied by Mrs. Taylor and
his two daughters, Miss Elizabeth Taylor
GENERAL CHARLES H. TAYLOR, Editor and Proprietor of the
Eoston Globe.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.\
and Miss Grace Taylor. The family will
remain in California during the winter.
General Taylor will be here about two
weeks. It is nis first visit to the State.
He was never before west of Chicago, and
the size of the land toward tho sunset, lie
says, has made a vivid impression on
him. He reached here by way of New
Orleans and Texas.
General Taylor has for nearly twenty
years been at the front of journalism in
Boston. He tcok the paper when it had
been run only about a year and began to
put life into it. He was soon a great
factor in all the affairs of New England.
At the present time his paper circulates
something over 200,000 copies daily and
reaches to almost 250,000 on Sunday.
General Taylor holds that it is always the
inside of the office that kills it, never the
outside. He thinks there is room for any
paper anywhere tbat has a good man in
its office. There may be better papers
there, he says, but this one will make
money and have influence and be an
abiding thing.
It is his opinion, too, that illustrated
papers have come to stay and that pretty
soon every daily in the country of any im
portance will have colored pictures.
"More artists will also be employed,"
said he. "Where there is one artist now
there will be two in two or lime years.
Illustrated papers have come to stay.
Pictures are a feature. The people want
them, and it is astonishing how the daily
papers have improved in making picture?.
"1 picked vi) the other day a copy of
Harper's Monthly thirty years old. Why,
trie pictures are better by far in the dailies
now than ia the periodical of that time.
I remember seventeen or eiirhteen years
ago we had pictures of tho Board of Al
dermen and ti.ey were s â  bad that they
made tbe Aldermen look like a lot of
thieves and thug*. Newspaper art has
'improved greatly since then and it will
keep improving."
Regarding the condition of business in
the East, General Taylor says it is im
proving, bnt slowly. In a little while, in
his opinion, it will be good.
â¢'There were some," be said, "who ex
peced tbat prosperity would come with a
bound simultaneously with McKinley's
election, but of course this could not be.
We wih have to make progress gradually.
It could not be expected that after such
an extraordinary period of dullness we
could reach &' prosperous condition im
mediate y.
"But there never was another time in
tbe history of our country when one da.v
was to settle whether we should have
good times or bad times. My opinion
is that we will move along pretty much as
now till spring and then things will open
out and we will have three or four years of
the greatest prosperity the country has
ever known. That is, unless there is an
extra session of Congress, as has been
talked of, it will start at that time. If
there should be an extra session to re
model tbe tariff it might be around mid
summer before they pet it tettled. This
would delay the prosperity that otherwise
would reach us in the spring.
"In New England enormous sums were
held back from investment and made
conditional on the election of McKinley.
One man in Boston proposed to build four
bie: houses at a cost of $1,000,000 if Mc-
Kinley were elected. If not he would not
invest anything. Since then the contracts
have been given, and pretty soon this
money will be paying for grading, cement,
lumber, labor and rinding its way to all
classes. It is true in thousands of other
cases there and over the country.
"We polled tbe greatest Republican
vote in Massachusetts in the recent elec
tion that was ever known. During the
war at one period, when the vote was
practically unanimous, we polled for a
war Governor 71,000 votes. But this year
McKinley got 172,000 votes. Curiously
enough, too, Bryan got his biggest audi
ence in Boston â an audience of 50.0C0 at
Faneuil Hall.
"In coming through the South I was im
pressed with tbe openings offered there.
The country is just being opened up, com
paratively speaking, and 1 would not be
surprised if there was twenty or thirty
years of great prosperity there."
General Taylor is a young-looking man,
considering the great paper he has founded
and the wealth he has acquired. If it were
not for his frosted beard ne would readily
be taken for a man of 40.
HANLEY IS A TRUE HERO.
A Policeman Stopped a Runaway Team
From Killing School
children.
Foreman Scholm of the '-Shooting the
Chutes" drives well enough on four wheels,
but when his buggy casts one of them it
is different.
This occurred yesterday, shortly before
noon, when the schoolchildren were about
to leave their classes for lunch, and if it
had not been for Officer W. H. Hanley it
is likely that there would have been heart
rending scenes.*
The foreman and another employe, be
hind two spirited horses, were on tneir
way into town when, on Stanyan street,
an off hind wheel slipped and threw both
men out. The horses became unmanage-
able and tore down through the park pan
handle, dragging the vehicle on three
wheels between obstacles better than it
could be steered at the horse show.
At Fell street they turned out north into
Baker street, where Officer llanley, mount
ed, patrols.
Fortunately -there were not many vehi
cles on the street at this time, but HanJey
in true cowboy style chased after the run
away for a couple of blocks until Fulton
street was reached. .
At that juncture he seized the horses by
the bridles and steered them around sud
denly, causing them to fall. : .
Had the horses continued to McAllister
street they would have crasned into the
children irom the Fremont Primary
School.
The Chutes lost their Buggy, that's all,
for the horses were handled .so well they
were little injured. The other losers in
this affair was the policeman, whose horsq
ran away white be was disentangling the
team that had run into and smashed
Georjre Heineman's wagon at Fulton and
Baker streets.

THE BIG DINNER
GETTING READY
The School Children Rally
to the Support of the
Army.
They Prove a Very Successful
Skirmishing Corps in the
Emergency.
Adjutant McFee's Office the Hea quar
ters for Donations of All Sorts,
Coming In Thick.
The Salvation Army Christmas dinner
fund is growing apace.
The school children can nearly always
be depended upon in a case of this kind.
Their sympathies are quick and warm.
They know what Christmas really is much
better than their elders, and the idea of
anybody not having a good warm dinner
on that day is something entirely too ter
rible to be thought of. So they have
turned in to serve the army as a skirmish
corps, and the result is a very brightening
prospect for the outcasts.
After school hours yesterday the little
people called in numbers at Adjutant Mc-
Fee's office reporting progress, and the
stockroom at 862 Folsom street is assum
ing the appearance of a very thrifty store.
The call for contributions is being an
swered with all sorts of things and there
will not only be a big dinner, but a distri
bution of warm clothes.

BOWMAN NOT RESPONSIBLE.
No Agency In Causing the Death of
Henry Peters' Son.
It has been determined by the Supreme
Court that C. E. Bowman was not respon
sible for the death of Henry Peters' 11
-year-old son. This lad was rafting on'
railroad ties on a pond. on . Ashbury
Heights which had been artificially cre
ated by the City, which, prior to 1889,
threw up an embankment there during
the grading of the street. He fell off and
was drowned. Bowman owned the lot on
which the pond was.
The Supreme Court yesterday handed
down a decision, in which it was set forth
that Bowman did nothing to create the
pond, and that the deceased boy was a
trespasser, and that the verdict in favor of
Bowman in the lower court was right.,
Therefore the judgment of the lower court
was affirmed.
STRANGE CASE.
J. 1,. Tisdale Sued for a Secret That He
Never Heard.
Judge Seawell yesterday granted a non
suit in tbe case of Thomas Curtis against
J. L. Tisdale. Mr. Curtis invented an
illuminating compound which he called
the "'Stanford Light," and alleges that he
sold to Mr. Tisdale for $750 the right to
make and sell th<Â» oil outside of San Fran
cisco, the plaintiff ngreeing to deliver the
formula on payment of the purchase
price. As the money was never produced
Mr. Curtis sued for it. The court reasuns
that as tbe thing to be delivered is a se
cret formula, it could not be treated as an
ordinary chattel.

. Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hiindredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; la*
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means high larometrlc pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair 1 weather:; "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually "preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather4tnd rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in tha interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
â¢rill produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
nEW YORK. N. T., Dec. 17.â A . firm tone
characterized operations at the Stock Exchange
to-day. The opening was steady owing to a higher
market for American securities -In- London. The
gain at times was equal to ViÂ© ls per cent, Rub
ber common scoring the largest gaiu. Shortly
after midday, however, the Gould stocks were
subjected to a severe raid and dec int-d 3 /532i4
per- cent. Manhattan fell from 92 Vi to 9.). A
turn for the better occurred around 1 o'clock,
when it was announced from Washington that
Secretary Olney would appear before the Senate
Committee on Foreign Affair* tomorrow 10 argue
against Congressional legislation on Cuban mat
ters st this time.
following this development the whole market
moved up under purchases for both long and short
accounts. The earn in prices was equal to VbÂ®- 1 2
percent and was well distributed. Tobacco led
the upward movement and rose 10 771/4 on talk of
a retirement of the scrip Issued eerly n the year.
Rubber commq-i rose 102684: Chicago Gas, Spirits,
Beading, the Grangers auu Louisville and Nash
ville were all conspicuous In the advance. Money
i.broad Is steadily hardening, discounts in the
market in London to-day having advanced to 334
percent, while rates here are merely nominal.
Again sterling exchange is gradually strength
en iux, and interest an I dividend payments doe to
Europe i.ext month loot up a very heavy total.
Ne. changes show gains of i>4@l cent. | Man

CHICAGO MAKKETS.
CHICAGO. fr.T- Dec. 17.â Short sellers, em
boldened by success achieved yesterday, made an
attack on prices this morning, forcing a decline
[ of i/fee from the low DOint of j yesterday. Quite as
j much indifference was shown by Liverpool to our
decline yesterday. as 10 our previous advance*,
but this did not de.ertlie talent from mint Its
best endeavor to break the market. There were
a number of crop-damage stories In circulation,
but they were evidently dUbelie ved. The Cincin

a.'O. Chicago received 40 cars and inspected out
73,234 bushels. Closing Continental cables were
loner.
Exports were heavy at 514,185 bushels. The
market evidenced an oversold condition in the last
hour when, on covering by shorts, prices rallied
11/4 C. Reported heavy shipnien:s of flour from
Newport News prompted the buying. May wheat
opened from 79 Vac to SO Vie, sold between 79 Vie

i CORNâ The to.al business In the corn market
cou'd very easily have been transacted In less than
j 30 minutes. It was purely 0 local affair, dealings
being confined entirely to a few local scalpers who
: based th lr action on what was going on In wheat.
' Receipts were 208 cars and 53,218 bushels were

General Pakenhain'a Body.
I desire to know if there is an authentic
account of General Edward Pakenbam's
body having landed at Charleston en
route for England. If there is any record
within your reach I would be glad to have
you furnish me witb the facts or state
where they can be found. I seek this in
formation in tbe interest of a bit of his
tory and uny help you can give me will
be appreciated. It seems that tbe pen
erat'* body was shipped for England in a
barrel of rum and that it was lost on the
way ; in fact, that tbe barrel was landed
at Charleston and eventually found its
way into ihe '"up country," where his
bones are supposed to remain to this day.
This is a matter of tradition, as far as I
can learn, but the facts are well sustained,
or the supposed facts, by the older genera
tion of men, and they tell a well connected
and reasonable story.â Charleston Nows
and Courier.
Tbe highest mountain in the Indian
Himalayas is Kunchaniyunga, 28, 178 feet.
Tbe highest falls are those of the Yosem
iie, some of which exceed 3000 feet.

FOR IMPROVEMENT
Clay-Street Owners May
Bond Themselves to
Pave Permanently.
The Business Center, Working
Westward, Has Invaded
the Thoroughfare.
Completion of the Big Sew.-r Has
Created a Desire to Make More
Improvements.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) j
908 Broadway, Dec. 17. )'
The most important move in the direc- I
tion of permanent improvement is the j
proposition to bond Clay street for the
purpose of paving v and placing it in first-
Class condition lor a business thorough
fare.
For several years Clay street has been |
,in a worse condition than any other street i
in the cit j r limits. Since the business i
center of the city has moved northward ;
and westward during the past three years, j
Clay street has became or vast import- |
. ance, as it is the next business thor-
which must be included in the
westward march. Four years ago Wash- j
ington street, which now leads Broadway
for business, was quieter and duller than
Clay street was a year ago. Now the
proposition to make Clay street a business
rival to Washington has taken a definite
Shape, and the churches and Y. M. C. A.,
who are the largest individual property
owners en the street, are in favor of bond
ing themselves for ten years for the pur
pose of raisins money to make perma
nent improvemerts.
â¢ Many large ii vestments have been'
made on Ciay street and on the cross
streets between it and Washington since
1894, and more are now in progress.
When the gas company built its hand
some terra-cotta Roman block at Thir
teenth and Clay streets three years ago, it j
was prophesied that they had made a big j
error in locating their office so far from
the center of business at ; hat time. Ap
parently the company knew better than !
their advisers, for in three years from now
their cilice will be within the business
center.
T c large sewer on Clay street has just
been completed, and the necessary water,
gas and telephone mains are also in hrst
class condition, and should tie street be
paved it will probably not be disturbed
for ten years. Tiie improvement of the j
street will naturally cause it to be patron
ized by business people, and the old com
plaint that the commerce of this city is
confined to a couple of blocks will no
longer bo true.
The move for improvement has been |
taken by the church folks, and this has j
caused tome comment. A few months j
a^o the First Hebrew congregation sold
its old site at a large figure, and moved to |
more commodious quarters further from
t(>e business part of town. Part of the
property of the First Congregational i
Cnurch has already been proposed to be I
used for business purposes, and it would '
seem to be only a matter of time wnen the j
large First Church will be glad to sÂ»et i
further away lrorn the commercial center, j
OLD YOUNG FOLKS.
They Perform to Kaigo a Scholarship
Fund for the High School
Class.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 17. j
The old folks of H:iy wards took part to
night in a farce which ra attended by
everybody in town that could crowd into
Native Sons' Hall. The play itself, which
was a representation of the Haywards
Schoolhouse ana its methods of education
half a century ago, was of secondary im
portance to the many interesting charac
ters that took part.
One of the most interesting of the act
resses was Mrs. Haywards, widow of the
man who named the town and who
brought out his house with him from
Maine around the Horn. Mrs. Haywards
took tt c part of a scholar and took it well.
Mrs. Hamer, another of the oldest reÂ»i
. dents, who is over 70 years of age, showed
th;.t she knew more of the rudiments of
education than the Trustees, wljo were
represented by P. Wilbur, Charles Prowse
â¢ and T. B. Jackson. D. S. fcmalley knew
rather too much ior his own good, end his
intricate knowledge of politics and the
insinuations that he made regarding the
method by which the Trustees were
elected gained for him a severe thrashing,
much to ;hÂ« delight of the youug people
in the audience.
Fred Allen, who has supplied Haywards
with news for many years, was another
apt pupil, but he was no match for Mrs.
E. Hathaway when it came to spelling.
Tne programme stated that the piece
was to be presented by ex-professionals of
Haywards, but there were many on the
platform whom it was difficult to connect
wjth any profession ex-ly or otherwise
Others who took part were: Miss Maud
Lawrence, Mrs. M. Maguire, Mrs. Me
â¢Cloud. Mrs. P. Wubert, E. M. Buck, Fred
Hoyt and it. C. Pier-01.
The purpose of the entertainment was to
raise funds for the sending to the univer
sity ol the Dupil who should win the
scholarship atlionp: thos;Â» who will gradu
ate ir.Â»m Haywards High School in the
olassof'97. "

Marks of Blood and Whisky.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 17.â T0-day
while fishing on the bay John Smith
found a sloop adrift. There were mark 9
of blood on the rail and in the boat was a
partially filled bottle of whisky. There

owners, nor was there any name on her.
From aupearances it did not seem that
the boat had gone adrift. Smith brougiit
the sloop to this city and turned her over
to the police, who think a crime ha-, been
committed. Thr-y will endeavor to "iden

four universities in tiie country equaling
California in number of students en

LOUIS MUHLNEB
HEARS HIS FATE
When He Shot Jennie

Manslaughter.
A New Trial, Granted by Judge

preme Court.

Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 17. )
Louis Muhlner will be sentenced for the
manslaughter of Jennie Lewie, whom he
shot to death on the porch of Professor
Mooar's residence over a year ago.
The case of Muhlner's sentence has cre
ated a great interest. At the trial the
jury brought in a verdict of manslaugh
ter. Judge Frick replied that the defend
ant should have been convicted of murder
in the first degree, and when Muhlner's
attornfy applied for a new trial Judge
Frick granted it on the ground that the
verdict was not In accordance with the
facts. The Judge also stated, in granting
the motion, that the point as to whether a
new trial could be granted on the ground
that a man should have been convicted of
a more serious offense than he was had
never been pa sed upon by the Supreme
Court.
The District Attorney's office appealed
from the Judge's ruling, because they said
that the logical result of Judge Frick's
action would be the freeing of the accused
entirely, on the ground that where a man
had once been found guilty of an offense
he could not aiterwara be tried upon a
more serious charge involvine the same
matter.
The Supreme Court takes the same view
as the District Attorney, and reverses the
decision of Judge Frick granting Muhlner
a new trial. This leaves Muhlner under
conviction of the crime of manslaughter,
the extreme penalty cf which is ten years
in the penitentiary.
The murder of Jennie Lewis took plnce
at the residence of Dr. George Mooar, near
the Pacitic Theological Seminary in
Augu?t of last year. Miss Lewis wan em
ployed there, and Muhlner, who was a
telegraph operator, frequently called on
her.
He was desperately in love with the
girl, but she would not consent to his pro
posal of maniage, and one afternoon he
went to the house and shot the girl on the
front doorstep.
A year ago Muhlner's bonds were set at
$15,000, and his aged father was driven to
nis crave with his effort to free his son.
He was unable, however, to raise the
necessary amount, and the only occasion
on which Muhlner has been out of the
county jail was when he was escorted by
two deputy Sheriffs to see his dead rather
prevails to his burial. As soon as the
remittitur comes from the Supremo Court,
Judge Frick will sentence Muhlner.
RECEIVED DIPLOMAS.
Thirty-Six High School Graduates Are
Awarded Them,
OAKLAND, Cal., DÂ«*c. 17.â The High
School graduates were awarded their
diplomas to-day. The large gymnasium
was decorated with all kinds of foliage and
the National colors and the big room was
filled with relatives and personal friends
of the thirty-six members of the class.
The platform presented a rather one
skied appearance. Of the whole class
only six were boys and, attired in their
black frock suits, they seemed lost among
the thirty young ladies attired in white.
The programme consisted of a few pa
pers and some music, but there was a
marked absence of the lengthy essays that
have been so common in the past and
which have made graduating exercises so
dull.
Principal McChesney announced that
the flags on the building were at half
mast in honor of two pupilsâ Leon Ferine,
who died Monday, and Nellie Pardee, who
died Wednesday. No member of the
class has died during the three years of
its existence.
President Clement of the Board of Edu

THE AERIAL BALLET.
A Production That Promltei to Bring
Local Theatrical Men Into
Court.
The aerial ballet which was given at the
Baldwin Theater last evening is likely to
cause trouble in theatrical circles. Mr.
Neilson, who was formerly with the
Brownie Company, claims the bullet as
his, and that he has a patent up or. it, so
far as this country is concerned. He says
it originated in the Foiies Bergeres in
Paris, but now belongs to him.
The Brownie people say there is no
patent on the ballet, and that they can
use it if they wish, and the Tivoli, too,
has stepped in and has billed an aerial
ballet for to-morrow night. Neilson says
he has sold it to the Orpheum people, and
it iÂ« billed there for Sunday night.
The Brownie people were told that if
they put the ballet on last night they
would be enjoined to-day. It was put on
last night, and law 'and the ballet may
mix up before this evening over the mat
ter.
A JAPANESE MISSION.
One to Be Established Soon by the
Chrintian Church.
There was a small but enthusiastic gath
ering of Christian workers in the Twelfth
street Christian church last evening. The
leaders of this denomination propose to
establish in this City a mission for the
education of Japanese into the ways of
Christianity. Rev. W. A. Coryea pre
sided. Representatives were present from
the half-dozen other Christian churches
around the bay. Dr. Coryea stated that,
while the work of sending missionaries to
Japan should go on, there is ample work
for the church at home. There are hun
dreds of Japanese in this City who, while
seeking for knowledge of our civilization,
are aiso seeking for Christian knowledge,
it is the duty and purpose of the Christian
church to enlighten and instruct them .
Those Japanese who are thus educated,
upon their return to Janun, will do much
good in apreaÂ«iine the gospel.
Several others spoke in a similar vein.
It is tho intention to meet soon aiter the
holidays and make permanent arrange
ments for the establishment of the mis
sion and the plan upon which it will be
conducted.

REDWOOD CITY WILL CASE.
Mrs. J. W. Wilson, the D.snhented Daugh-
ter and Only Heir of the Late James
Queimn, to Contest.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Dec. 17.â Th<?
will of the late James Quentin, who, it
will be remembered, cued in San Mateo
Cou.ity some two months ago, leaving to
strangers an estate valued from $75,000 to
$100,000, and express y disinheriting his
daughter, Mrs. J. W. Wilson, came up for
probate iv the Superior Court this morn
ing before Judge Buck. Although it was
generally supposed that the probate of the
will would be contested by Mrs. W.lson,
yet upon the matter being called no ob
jection was made to its proof. This does
not by any means siguity that no effort
will be made to break the will. Every
thing points to the contrary. According
to the laws of this State any one interested
may contest either the probate of tne will
or contest the will itself at any time
within one year alter it has been admitted
to probate.
Tnat there will be a fight for the dead
man's property is conceded. Counsel has
been employed for that purpose. That
the proponents of the will expect such a
contest is evidenced by the extreme pre
caution they are taking in all the prelimi
nary matters. The testimony of ail the
subscribing witnesses to tiie will, as also
that of other witnesses who to-day testi
fied as to the sanity of the testator at the
time of making the instrument, has been
reduced to writing and subscribed by
them. This, as 's known, will be good
evidence in any subsequent contest con
cerning the validity of the will or the suf
ficiency of the proof thereof, should the
witnesses in the meantime die or remove
from the State. The executors, Dr. Emer
son and Thomas Stealey, are also person
ally interested in upholding the will, they
being legatees, one to the extent of $5000,
the other to one-third of all the real and
personal property. Tliey were appointed
executors without bonds and have made
application ior letters testamentary.
Should Mrs. Wilson succeed In breaking
the will the whole of decedent's property
will go to her, as she is the only known
living relative. Developments of a sensa
tional nature may be expected at any
time.

FOR THE FRESNO
CITRUS EXHIBIT
An Excursion of Business
Men to Leave To-
Night.
Round- Trip Tickets by Steamer
and Train Good Till
Monday.
City Commission Merchants Will Se
the Midwinter Fair of the San
J i: quin Valley.
Yesterday a committee of representa
tive San Joaquin Valley fruit men, com
posed of Arthur R. Brings, O. J. Wood
ward, C. H. Markham, Fulton (i. Berry,
A. Garten iaub and Louis Gudelfinger, ar
rived in this City from Fresno. The mis
sion of these gentlemen is to get up an
excursion from San Francisco to the
splendid citrus fair now being held at
Fresno, and their rirst visit was to the
railroad and steamer offices. At ibe
former place they readily procured a
round-trip rate of $590, the ticket good
from to-day till Monday morning.
The passengers will leave the ferry at
4:30 in :he afternoon and arrive in Fresno
at midnight. The berth in the sleeper may
be retained tiii the return to this City.
The tickets by the river boats by way of
Stockton will cost $3 50 for the round trip,
the steamer leaving the foot of Clay or
Washington streets at about 6 o'clock this
evening, arriving at Fresno at 10 o'clock
Saturday morning. The tickets for this
route may be procured at the State Board
of Trade rooms, 16 Post street. '
The committee visited the Chamber of
Commerce and was so successful in its
canyass that a number of that body not
only signified their intention to take ad
vantage of the opportunity to attend the
citrus fair at Fresno, but immediately in
stitute a canvass of the business men of
the City generally to take a holiday aown
through the San Joaquin*Valley.
At their solicitation a special meeting
of the Council of Associated Industries
was called to meet the members of the
committee in the rooms of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association at the
Mills building last evening. At the open
ing Chairman Julian Sonntag stated the
very laudable desire of the gentlemen from
Fresno and expressed h;msell as heartily
in favor of going down to see what the
citrus-growers of the San Joaquin were
doing in the matter of a winter fruit
exhibit.
Mr. Briggs, upon being invited to ad
dress the council, s; oke as follows:
"We feel that San Francisco should have
a strong interest in our fair. The mer
chant and the fruit buyer should come to
the San Joaquin Valley and learn for him
self bow our splendid orchards and vine
yards produce. We of the country realize
the need of closer affiliation between San
Francisco and the interior. There has
been slight jealousy on the part of tiie
little cities for the big City.
"The people of the valleys have become
possessed of the idea that there is a cold
ness on the part of San Francisco toward
the country fair?, and now if the people of
the metropolis will lay aside business to
morrow evening and come down to Fresno
the act will do much to do away with that
old feeling.
"We want you to know that we raise
finer citrus fruits than Los Angeles, and
have the products of our orchards ready
for market thirty days earlier than the
growers in the south. We nave a magnifi
cent exhibit this year and we want you to
come and see it."
Secretary Filcher of the State Board of
Trade spoke in the same vein. He had
been there, he said, and was s mply as
tonished at the things he had seen. And
it was the cheapest trin be had ever taken
â 25 cents for a meal fit for a prince.
Mr. Woodward of the committee said
that the San Joaquin Valley was the first
to come to the San Francisco Midwinter
Fair and the City sliould come to theirs.
All of the members of the council ex
pressed themselves enthusiastically in
favor of lending tneir efforts toward get
ting up a big excursion party to Fresno
this evening and the following resolutions
were adopted :
Whereas, There is now being held at the
city of Fresno what is known as the San
Joaquin Valley Citrus Fair; and whereas, a
delegation of leading citizens of the said San
Joaquin Valley are now iv our C.ty for ths
purpose of extending a cordial and earnest
invitation to the business men and citizens
generally of San Francisco to avnil them
selves of an excursion to said fair, and
whereas, we approve and indorse the efforts
of the citizens of Fresno and the other coun
ties of the Sun Juaquin in gathering together
at great expense tne citrus fruits and oi her
winter products of their rich and magnificent
region lor the interest, the pknsure and en
lightenment of their visitors and of the world;
and whereas, we believe that all opportunities
should be improved to stimulate and encour
age a better tee. ing and more cordial relations
between the people of the interior and those
of the metropolis, and that a closer inter
mingling is calculated to promote this result;
therefore be It
Rctolved, That it is the sense of the Council
of Associated Industries that the invitation of
the Fresno committee to visit its fair should
be accepted by the citizens ot San Francisco in
the cord.al spirit in which it is intended, and
that we urge as many of our merchants and
others as can possibly do so to lay aside other
duties and arrange tueir affairs to participate
in the proposed excursion and visit the said
citrus fair.
Reao'ved, That it is the sense of this council
thtita liberal attendance at said lair at this
time wilt bear fruit in the way oi an improved
cordiality between our City and tiieSan Jonquin
Valley that will in time, aside from tne pur
suit of personal pleasure, repay us a hundred
fold.
A large number of merchants have
stated ti.at they will make Saturday a
holiday and attend the Fresno citrus
fair, and there will doubtless be a large
crowd leave the City this evening.
TIDAL WAVE 8 A SANTA BARBARA.
Large Section of the Beautiful Boulevard
Curried Aumij.
SANTA BARBAPtA, Cal., Dec. 17.â A
tidal wave, the largest in the history of
Santa Barbara, washed over the boulevard
at 8 o'clock ihis morning, carrying witn it
a large section of that beautiful and ex
pensive driveway. Tho boulevard was
buiit s-ome five years ago, and bulk eaded
so securely that it was thought to be im
pervious to the action of the ways, and
pronounced such by the city engineer,
but the bounding billows of the Pacific,
as though hnngry for an early breakfast,
embraced this scientific wonder and car
ried off a cutlet of asphaltum arid solid
masonry, heavy framework and- iron in
its receding grasp, nearly fifty feet square
and eight feet aeep. A large force of men
was immediately put to work tilling the
washout with bags of sand to prevent fur
ther, if not total, dentruction. A lar.e
Bandhill between the boulevard and ordi
nary high tide was carried completely out
to sea.

FAVORITES MIRED
IN THE GOING
Sticky Mud Was Fatal to
All but One First
Choice.
Tommy Murphy Suspended lor a
Careless Ride Astride
B^ddmgton.
Billy Vice Scores Again at a Good
Priceâ McLight Failed to Gat a
Mark in tbe Mi'.e Run.
It is generally understood around race
tracks that when four out of six favorites
are toppled over the layers of odds get all
the money. Althouch four choices were
beaten at Oakland yesterday many of the
winning horses received substantial sup
port, on one or two races in particular the
ring being hit hard.
Tne goins was especially adapted for the
tumbling down of good things, being of
the sticky, holding sort. Not a few of the
starters came in minus plates.
The attendance was quite up to the aver
age with considerable money circulating.
The different events were all well con
tested, the finishes in many being of the
blanket order.
Although Mr. Corrigan did not think
very highly of his entry Soniro in the
opening rive and a half furlong scramble
the geiding was sent to the post a 9 to 10
favorite. In a drive Jones got him home
a length before Jay Wheeler after leading
all the way. Candor, ridden with poor
judgment by Shaw, was a close third.
The deteat of tbe 7 to 20 choice, Kedding
ton, ridden by Tommy Murpi.y in the
race following, a six-furlong selling affair,
was quite unexpected, as the gelding wus !
c nsiuered a moral. He led into the j
stretch by a couple of lengths and it I
looked all over. Near the sixteenth pole |
be stepped in a hole and stumbled. He
then tued his old trick of bearing in
toward the rail, and Murphy, being a
trifle careles3 possibly, was beaten out a
ecant head by Palmerston, an 8 to 1 shot,
well ridden by J. Gardner.
Six mud-runners next started in a five i
and a half furlong spin, with the tcale of j
weights raised twenty pounds. Hymn |
was barred in the betting on account of
his bad-acting proclivities while at the
post. .Altanero, the Baldwin entry, rid
den by Bob horn, was a 9 to 10 tavorii**. I
At the last moment Riiey Grannan went |
down the line on Billy Vice and in a bard j
drive Golden got Biily home a head in ad- I
vance of the favorite. Petrarch was beat
a half length further away.
Another sizzling favorite was sent to
grass in the mile run. Although in the;
past McL.ght has never demonstrated a
loudn ss ior sticky going he was dished \
out as a warm 6 to 5 choice. H. Martin
hustlei Schnitz off in front at the jump, I
and Charley Sanders' chestnut stayed
there, winning at the end by three
lengths, with Can't Dance second, a !
couple of lengths belore Flashlight. The
first choice was fourth.
The finish to the last event, a thirteen
sixteentha run for all aces, decided under
selling conditions, was the most exciting j
of the day. Fig Leaf was a pronounced 4 j
to 5 favorite, and after ieading to the j
stretch ran out and was joined by Major I
Cook, Tempestuous ana Kowaisky, and it j
was a guess as to the winner from that on. i
As the wire was passed the Major had his
head a neck before Tempes'uous. which i
gelding was but half a length in front of
Kowalsky. Had Fig Leaf run true she
would have won.
Notes.
T. Murnhy was suspended by the judges j
for what they consider his criminally care- I
less ride on Reddin^ton. At best he is a
hard horse to ride, possessed of the bad
habit of bearing in toward the inner rail, i
and Mr. Corrigan, its owner, attached no
blame to his jockey for losing the race, j
That horseman states that at about the ;
sixteenth pole Reddington stepped into a ;
hole, which seriously retarded his progress, ;
and thi3 fact may have been overlooked j
by many. In the last race run Figleaf, ;
another hot favorite, looked a certain :
winner until she began running out, de
fying Slaughter's efforts io keep her |
straight, and eventually finished out3ide
of the money. Murphy is inclined to be
come a trifle careless when having a race
well in hand, and a day or two on the

Wiuner, BojlÂ« & Holly's b. g., by Bulwark-SUter to Violet. Time,
Joe Ullman, the jovial Chicago penciler;
Dave Gideon ; Ge..rge Wheelock, the book
| maker; Jockey Harry Griffin, Abe Ross
j man and Euiiie Lewis. Mr. Ullman
| stated that he had no cause for complaint,
j havine had a very successful season East
I this year. Griffin will ride as a free lance
j and will undoubtedly experience no diffi â¢
j. culty in obtaining mounts.
ThÂ« disposal sale of thoroughbreds, the
j property of Hon. L. J. Rose of Los Ange-
I les, held at Killip & Co.'s salesyard last
evening, was not a very successful one.
Nomad wai knocked down to "Daguie"
Smith for $500, and the jumper, Baby
i Bill, was secured by J. King for $750.
Most of the mares, yearlings and wean
lincrs were withdrawn for lack of bids.
Ed Purser ran second to Major Cook
with Tempestuous, and when the Major,
entered at $s<o. was put up to be sold,
Purser said ?1200. The $5 bid necessary to
hold him was not forthcoming on the part
of his trainer, and henceforth he will eat
hay and oats paid for by the Cambridge
stable. Tom Boyle, who trained Cook,
smiles and intimated that the latter stable
often enters horses in selling events at
quite a cheap figure.

running events:

VON TIEDEMAN'S TRIAL.
A Copy of Mrs. Sarah Owen spencer's
Photograph Ha* Been Supplied.
Carl yon Tiedeman, charged with per
jury, was dressed in his usually elaborate
style when he entered Judge Wallace's
courtroom yesterday morning, but he did
not look so hopeful as on the opening day
of the trial.
The order made by Judge Wallace ad
mitting in evidence the original, negative
of the photograph of Sarah Owen Spencer
in place of the picture that had been ao-
from the archives of the court
had a depressing effect on the defendant.
At the opening of court Deputy District
Attorney Peixotto produced the negative
and a copy of the original photograph.
Mrs Spencer and W. V. Spencer, her hus
band, identified the picture as an exact
copy of the likeness that had been made
for thÂ«m from the same piate.
Fred Berlem, clerk lor Taber's photo
crapnic gallery, test. lied to the same ef
fect.
Thomas Dillon, Charles Crockett and
Mr. Pc xotto said that the copy looked
like the picture which Yon Tiedeman
swore was a photograph of the woman
who signed the deed.
Mrs. Spencer was wheeled into court in
an invalid's carriage and the afternoon
was occupied in hearing her testimony.
She produced a great mass of documentary
evidence to support her testimony to the
effect that she was Lot in California at the
time the forgery was committed.

BURIAL ORDINANCE
FOUND INVALID
The Odd Fellows' Cemetery
Association Wins
Its Case.
Decision of Much Importance
Rendered by the Supreme
Court
Justice McFarland Filed an Emphatic
Opinion Dissenting From His
Associates.
The Supreme Court, sitting in banlr. yes
terday decided that ordinance 2950 of the
City and County of San Francisco is in
valid. This is the order which prohibits
the further purchase of lots for burial pur
roses within the City and County; also
providing for further burials being made in
lots heretofore acquired by persons or
associations for burial purposes.
The wide scope of the decision in its
effects may be inferred from the dissent
ing opinion filed by Justice McFarland,
which was in part as follows: "If tne fur
ther sale and purchase of lots for burial
purposes cannot be prohibited unless all
burials in lots already purchased are pro
hibited, then it is evident that there can
be no gradual progress toward the extin
guishment of the cemetery evil. The or
dinance operates uniformly upon all the
class who come within its provisions. As
lone as the sale and purchase of lots for
burial purposes are allowed the cemetery
evil will be greatly magnified and its sup
pression made correspondingly more diffi
cult."
Justices Harrison, Van Fleet, Temple,
Hens'iaw and Beatty held against the
validity of the ordinance. The closing
paragraph of the opinion, which was by
Justice Harrison, was as follows: "As the
ordinance, by its terms as well as by its
operation, discriminates between the in
dividuals upon whom it is intended to
operate, it is, upon that ground, unreason
able and invalid, and the petitioner should
be discharged."
Few opinions banded down in the
Supreme Court in laic years have more
general interest to the City and County of
San Francisco than this, especially in
tbat very large section of the Ciiy known
as Kichmond, in which the cemeteries
principally are.
The case in which the decision was
readied was known as ex pane Bohen on
habeas corpus. Mr. Bohen, as the presi
dent of the Odd Fellows' Cemetery Asso
ciation, signed a conveyance of certain
lois in the Odd Fellows' Cemetery and
therefore aided and aDetted, according to
the complaint, in the violation of the
ordinance. The lower court found him
guilty of the offense as charged. He then
took the case into the Supreme Court
upon an application for a writ of habeas
corpus. The Supreme Court clears him of
all liability in the decision which finds '
that the ordinance itself is invalid.
The Supreme Court, discussing the or
dinance, related some history. Under an
act of the Legislature of April' 25, 1863, the
Board of Supervisors of San Francisco
was authorized to make "all regulations
which may be expedient for the preserva- I
tien of the public health and the preven- j
tion of contagious diseases." The City |
and County could, throuch the Supervi- :
sors, pass ordinances providine for the
burial of the dead within certain portions ;
of the City, but the power of the Legisla- j
ture to prohibit burials in the entire City,
as well as the power of the City to pass *
ordinances therefor, were. questions not!
presented for consideration in determin- j
ing the validity of the ordinance under !
which the petitioner for the writof habeas ;
corpus was convicted.
The ordinance does not, so the court
found, prohibit burials within the City,
nor does it prohibit them within any des
ienated ponion of the City. On the con
trary, there is, by the terms of the ordi- !
nance itself, an express sanction of the j
right of those who have purchased lots for
the purpose of burial in any portion of the
City, to continue to bury until their ca
pacity is exhausted.
Incidentally the court referred to the
remaining capacity of the Odd Fellows'
Cemetery." "It appears that the Odd Fel- !
lows' Cemetery will permit the interment i
of 18,000 bodies, while the capacity of the I
unsold lots is only 3600." There is no re
striction in the ordinance upon persons
whose bodies may be burled in lots sold
except that they shali not be used for gen
eral interment purposes, and the owner of |
a lot may consent to the burial of one who
hxs no interest in the lot.
Unlimited burials and danger to living
persons might be reasons for the ordi
nance, but while burials are permitted in
the district the privilege cannot be lim
ited to one class of citizen". The owner of
a lot within a cemetery who has purchased
it for purposes of burial holds the same
subject to the right of the City of prohibit
ing further burials. The ordinance in
question forbids^ the purchase or sale of
any parcel of land if made for the purpose
of doing an act there which is in itseii not
only not illeÂ»al nnd forbidden, but is by
the same ordinance recojrnized as legal
and permitted to others. Tne sale and

The Street Committee Postpones Cut
ting Through the Cemetery.
The matter of cuttinz Sutter street
throuch Laurel Hill Cemetery was again
before the Street Committee of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday, and it was de
cided to postpone action on the matter
for sixty days, which leaves the matter in
the hands ot the newly elected board in
case it cains its seat. The representation
was made to the committee that to pay
the damage 3to those owning lots in the
cemetery would cost the City $1,000,000,
and on this showing the matter was post
poned.

JIM CORBETT WILL FIGHT
He Has Agreed to Meet Fitzsim
mons in a Contest to
a Finish.
Dan Stuart Will Select the Battle
Ground and Fitzsimmons Will
Be There on Time.
Martin Julian received a telegram last
night from Dan A. Stuart, stating that J.
J. Corbett had signed articles for a finish
fight with Fitzsimmons for a $15,000 purse.
The battle will take place in Mexico
March 17, 18S7, the exact location to be
mentioned by Stuart thirty days before
the time set and the full purse put up to
be divided equally between the two puei
ksts if Stuart fail to bring the battle off.
Julian and ii z?immons contemplate
leaving here in a few days, and have wired
to Stuart their acceptance of the terms.
A telegram was also received by a local
sporting man from the sport. ng editor of
a New York daily giving the added infor
mation that Corbelt was not willing for
anybody to have a kinetoscope or other
instrument for picturing the right unless
the club wouid agree to raise the amount
of the purse or unseso a private arrange
ment could oe made agreeable to all.
This also strikes Fitz favorably.
liot i Julian and Fitzsimmons were
e'.ated last night to learn that Coroett had
signed. They stated that the referee mu
tually agreed upon some timo ago is
Geor.ue Siier, the sporting editor of the
Chicago Tribune.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER IS, 1896.
SHE IS NOW AN
ATTORNEY'S BRIDE
Mrs. Mary Kane Gibbs
Marries Alexander
HeynemaD.
The Solemn Words Are Spoken
in a Dainty Floral
Bower.
Dr. Mackenzie Officiates at the Wed*
ding and Reuben Lloyd Is
Best Man.
Mrs. Mary Kane Gibbs and Alexander
Heyneman were married last evening at
the home of the bride's mother, Mrs. P, E.
Gibbs, 2508 Fillmore street. Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie pronounced the words that
made the happy young couple one.
Mr. Heyneman is a popular young law
yer, who enjoys an enviable reputation in
this community. His bride is the daugh-
MR. AND MRS. ALEXANDER HEYNEMAN.
ter o! the late Frederick E. Gibbs, who for
many years filed with credit many posi
tions of public trust.
The wedding last evening, owing to the
ill health of the bride's mother, was quiet
and informal. Sixty-five invited euests
assembled in the rose decorated drawing
rooms to witness the ceremony. There
were no bridal attendants.
Little Alice Elvesson, a niece of the
groom, preceded the bridal party to the
floral bower, where the solemn words were
spoken. Reuben H. Lloyd, the attorney,
was best man, and Henry Landsberger and
Otto Heyneman ushers.
The bride wore on eletrant gown of
white embroidered chiffon over a founda
tion of white satin. At the thront was
pinnea a pearl and diamond cluster
brooch, the gift of t c groom.
The bridal gifts were unusually hand
some and costly. There were many pieces
of silver and crystal and much old-point,
the gist of an old friend of the bride's
mother.
Mr. and Mrs. Heyneman will leave this
morning for a bridal tour, which will be
necessarily contracted on account or the
approaching holidays. The newly wediled
pair, nowever, expect to extend their trip
in the spring.
ARC LIGHTS NOT READY.
Consequently the Sixteenth-Street Cele
bration Will Not Take Place
Saturday Night.
The merchants and storekeepers of
Sixteenth street are sadly disappointed
by the Edison Electric Light and Power
Company. For some time pas: the
Sixteenth-street Improvement Club has
been making efforts to have the street
lighted by electric arc lamps from Valen
cia to Folsom. At last the means and
support necessary was obtained, and a
contract was made with the Edison people
to have all of the lamps in by Saturday
night. Arrangements were made for a
grand celebration on Saturday evening,
with its attending brass band, bonfires
and decorations and crowds of moving
people.
The members of the club yesterday re
ceived word from the electiic-light people
that it will be impossible to get the lamps
put up before next Wednesday. When
the club met last evening disappointment
was visible upon the laces of all. The
club has now decided not to hold a cele
bration at all upon the occasion of the
lighting of the street as all toe other im
provement clubs in the City will have
had their celebrations. However, another
plan is on foot that has in it the element
of novelty.
It is ibis. There will be monthly cele
bratiojis with band, bonfire, etc. The
idea i 3 that on such occasions every mer
chant and dealer in the blocks and those
on Mission street, from Fifteenth to Sev
enteenth, will have special sales in some
of their lines of good-*. Everyone con
tributing to the fete will have his special
sale advertised on the band-wagon and on
street posters. The purpose is to cause
vhÂ« people from the surrounding districts
to flock to the light and music, attracted,
not only by these features but by the cer
tainty of obtaining good bargains. It is
likely that, the first monthly celebration
will be held on New Year's eve. There is
a rumor in the Mission that the large
laundry on Sixteenth street is about to
put in a large elect' ic lighting and power
plant and make a bid for street, store and
house lighting cf the entire district.
QUARANTINING MAILS.
trotters From Japan's Infected Ports
Likely to Be Delayed.
The Postoffice officials were a little*pnz
zled yesterday upon the receipt of a letter
from the local Board of Health, in which
notice was given thut Yokohama and
Kobe had been declared infected ports,
and that all passengers and baggage will be
removed to the quarantine station at An
gel Island and fumigated. The question
is if baggage means the mails? If bo no
quarantine officer has the authority to
' break the seals on the mail pouches and
scatter the contents. None but the postal
authorities can do this.
Again, it is asked if thelawcontemplatps
making postal authoritif-s quarantine offi
cers, or. rather, to do the work of quaran
tine officers. In times past a postotfice
inspector has been sent to the quarantine
station, where he remained during the
epidemic in the infected ports. It may be
necessary to do so again, but it is likely
tbat instructions from Washington will
be received upon this point before such
a step is taken. The postai authorities do
not want it understood thit they are an
tagonistic to the health officers, but that
they will help to the fullest extent of their
powers in such matters; but, as stated in
the foregoing, they do not exactly under
stand the present situation.
FOR HOMELESS GIRLS.
A Bazaar Held at the California Girls'
Training Home on Natoma
Street.
The California Girls' Training Home
held a bazaar yesterday from 10 a. m
until 10 p. m. at the home's building, 147
Natoma street. The intention was to add
to the fund for the maintenance of the
home, and the manager, Mrs. L. B.
Fischer, says the receipts from the sales
were excellent. All the articles on sale
were made by the twenty-nine girls who
are inmates of the home.
Mrs. Fischer is very much pleased at
the assistance rendered the home by the
Girls' High School, which recently held
an entertainment and raised quite a large
sum. The money thus acquired will go to
furnishing several of the rooms in the
commodious new building. Their num
ber is seventy, but many are still unfur
nished.
It is also desired by the manager that
all those charitably inclined would call on
Tuesday and inspect the home nnd see
the practical benefits resulting from the
plan under which it is conducted.
THE COOPER INQUESTS.
No Sew Light Thrown I'pon the Awful
Double Trageil}-.
The inquests on the bodies of Mrs.
Sarah B. Cooper and her daughter Har
riet were held yesterday at the Morgue.
The testimony was almost identical with
the published accounts of the fad deaths
oi these well-known philanthropists. The
verdict in the case of the daughter was
that she "had come to her death by her
own liana while laboring under tempo
rary insanity."
Upon the death of Mr?. Sarah B. Cooper
the jury decided that she had "come to
her death December 11 by asphyxia from
illuminatine gas, and we further find that
death occurred at the hand of her daugh
ter. Miss Harriet Cooper, deceased, while
the said Miss Harriet Cooper was tempo
rarily insane."
The witnesses were John Bonner, Mrs.
G. T. Gaden, Wong Louie (the Chinese
servant) and Dr. Sidney Worth. The tes
timony t;iven by these in the case of the
daughter was repeated in the case of Mrs.
Cooper, but none of the evi.lonce threw
any new light upon the awfu> tragedy.
The jurors were: George K. Kibble (fore
man), E. J. McNeill, H. F. Fl'nn, A. J.
Washburn, N. C. Hulte, E. T. Zahler, A.
Block, William R. Reid.
Threats to Kill.
G. Capplllino and G. Campl are rival scaven
gers. Cappillino lives at 512 Nineteenth street,
and yesterday morning he swore to a com
plaint in Judge Joachimson's court for Campi'g
arrest on the charge of threats to kill. He
sÂ«id that Campi had been trying to take his
customers from him aud Wednesduy afternoon
ihey met and Campi pulled a revolver out of
his pocket and threatened to kill him ia the
presence of two witnesses.

217 BUSH ST,
WILL AID THE
CUBAN PATRIOTS
A Club Formed to Give
Moral and Financial .
Support.
One Hundred and Fifty Mem-
bers Have Joined the
Organization.
J H. Jones Is President and F. E.
Mascherini Secretaryâ May Sand
Men to Cuba.
The first organized movement in this
City looking toward the ireedorn of Cuba
from the Spanish yoke has been started,
and already 150 citizens, who were thrilled
with tl c accounts of General Maceo's
death, have enrolled themselves for the
cause.
The originators of the movement, which
has already taken the form of a club, are
J. H. Jones, who is in the employ of Su
pervisor C. L. Taylor, and F. S. Mascher
ini, a grocery, wine ' and liquor dealer,
whose place of business is at 718 Greenwich
street.
Tne object, at present, is not to raise a
force of armed men to go to Cuba to fight
for its freedom, but rather to give finan
cial and moral support to the patriots who
are now battling against the overwhelm
ing armies of General Weyler.
Later, if the movement receives the sup
port and encouragement that io expected,
a number of picked men may be sent to
join one of the numerous bands that are
constantly starting for the soat of war
from Eastern States.
In order to give the matter all the prom
inence possible, a mass-meeting at one of
the big halls in thi3 City will "be held in
the near iuture, and well-known speakers
who are known to be in sympathy with
Cuba will i>e asked to address the audi
ence. After that plans for raising funds
will be formulated and every possible
means taken to keepthe Cuban Junta aud
the patriots of the island informed of the
feelings of the people of California toward
them.
The active promoters of the plan are:
J. H. Jones, Faust E. Mascherini, David
Lecari, L. Becker, ' John Sandbench, J.
Oliva, li. Murray, Charles. Campbell and
Chartes Telghman, and the othcers are:
J. H. Jones, president; F. E. Mascherini,
secretary, and David Lecari, sereeant-at
arms. Several rr.eetinss have been held
at the place or business of Secretary Mas
cherini, which is the headquarters of the
club.
"We hope to render the struggling
Cubans much aid/ said President Jones

GRAND JURY SESSION
Title to Mission I'.azt and Other Lands
Reserved for Public Use.
The Grand Jury met last evening- and
asked City and County Attorney Creswell
to throw some light on the litigation in
which titie to the Mission Plaza and a
hosnital lot is involved. Mr. Creswell
was with the jury for an hour or more and
went over the voluminous record in the
cases.
The purpose of the Grand Jury is to
stimulate the municipal authorities to
vigorous measures in order tbat the City
may secure undisputed possession of lands
reserved for public ute by the Van Ness
ordinance. Owing to neglect of officers
chose n to guard the interests of the City
claimants with little or no shadow of title
have been allowed to grab and hold valu
able lands which belong to the public.
It is believed thut if the cases now on
the court calendar are handled with skill
and determination valuable lands in dis
pute may yet be saved.
The Grand Jury will adjourn sine die
sometime next week. Committee re
ports were received and discussed last
night. Another session will be held to
day. Judge Slack desires to follow the
law and impanel another Grand
Jury before the expiration of the present
year, so the members of the existing jury
have but a few days to complete their re
port.
The Sharkey-Fitzsimmons prizefight did
not engage the attention of the jury last
night. The Civic Federation may sand a
communication on this topic to-day.
MEN TOE A MANLESS ISLE.
Keinhart Lectures on His South Sea
Colony Scheme.
J. H. Rein hart, proprietor of the colony
now forming to settle the so-called "man
less isle" of Et John, delivered a lecture
on his scheme at Metropolitan Temple
la?t night. The attendance was not large,
but the enthusiasm of the speaker was
great.
The lecturer becan by saying that he
was lured into the notion of the colony hy
the reports of luxuriant vegetation and
unequaled opportunities.
"It requires an ordinary carpenter
eleven years to make $4779," he said, "but
down in the i-lands tlieni would be liberty
and great chances. There is good timDer,
fishing is splendid aud general opportuni
ties are unequaled."
The speaker said he had about twenty
men who wanted to join the colony, but
thought be could get 100.
It was rumored last night, however.that
Sir John Thurston now has absolute con
trol of the settlement of the i.-Uands, and
that tie opposes Americans, his experience
at Fiji making him despise them asset
tiers. It is said that the Marquis Durei
was imprisoned many years ago for at
tempting^ settlement similar to that pro
posed by keinhart.
