the Rules of War.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 14. â The
Cuban League of the United States was
formally organized in this City this even
ing. Tne men behind the movement are
so well known and carry so much weight
that it is beyond a doubt that this is the
beginning of a movement that will take
no small part in the history of both coun
tries. Tbe meeting organized with Colonel
Ethan Allen as president and the follow
ing as vice-presidents: Charles A. Dana,
ex-Governor Roswell P. Flower, ex-Post
master-General Thomas M. James, Cbaun
cey M. Depew, John M. D6st>a*sos, Theo
dore Roosevelt, ex-Mayor Thomas F. Gil
roy, George Hoadley, J. Edward Simmons
and C. H. Dennison.
Francis Wayland Glen was elected sec
retary, Darwin R. James treasurer, and
the executive committee was made upas
follows : John Jacob Astor, Paul Dana,
General Daniel Butterfield, Colonel Fred
D. Grant, Edwin Wardman, John C. Mc-
Guire, R. C. Alexander, Constant A. An
drews, Frank B. Carpenter, John D. Kei
ley and Thomas E. Stewart.
In opening the meeting Colonel Allen
read this call:
"We. the undersigned, citizens of this
Republic, anxious lor the success of all
people in obtaining the civil and political
liberty which this Nation secured more
than a century ago and still enjoys,
, unite in organizing the Cuban League
â¢i the United States of America.
"Tbe object of this league is to secure
*J for Cuba by all lawful, peaceful and
' honorable means the political inde
pendence which her patriots are now en
deavoring by tremendous sacrifice of
treasure and life to gain, to encourage
them with our sympathy and moral sup
port, and to arouse the whole Nation to
demand an end of the campaign of mur
der and destruction in that island.
"Mindful of the help which our fathers
received in a similar struggle, we are con
strained by a sense of gratituie to return
to Cuba the kindness which was so ef
fec iveiy g^ven to us.
"It is apparent to all thouehtful observ
ers that Spain has not the power to crush
the Cuban patriots, and therefore the con
tinuance of the cruel struggle in Cabacan
only serve to prolong a sense of abase
ment and humiliation in the minds of all
men who are confident that this Republic
has the power to end it, and is in honor
called upon to do so for the highest good
of all parties directly concerned."
This call was signed by ail the men
above named. Oiher prominent signa
tures attached to it were General Powell
Clayton, A. B. Hepburn, Silas P. Dutcher,

ford, Colonel William L. Brown, Genera!
Martin T. McMahon, Hon. Noah Davis,
Warner Miiler, General Howard Carroll,
Dr. A. M. Fernandez, Alonzo B. Cornell
and about fifty others.
Colonel Allen predicted tbat the move
ment thus started would become historic.

TO FIGHT FOR CUBA.
One Ihounand Volunteers Soon to De
part for ih* Troubled Inland.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 14.â Volunteers
for the relief of the Cuban insurgents are
being mobilized in this city, and next Fri
day, if all plans are carried out success
fully, 1000 men will leave New Orleans for
Cuba. Two hundred of these are St.
Louisans, the remainder coming from
East St. Louis and points south of here
on the lines of the Illinois Central and
Iron Mountain railroads.
Julius Van Gerst of New Orleans will be
in charge of the expedition with W. C.
Carter, J. L. Goodnerand Cornelius Knott
of this city as aids. The quartet met
here at noon to-day and completed ar
rangements. Van Gem and Knott will
leave this evening on the Illinois Central,
picking up the men on that road as far
south as Cairo and pernaps Memphis, and
will tben proceed via steamboat to New
Orleans. This programme was planned
so as to avoid suspicion. Van Gerst claims.
He is not reticent about giving informa
tion, because he says this is a move of
deep interest to the American people and
he feels sure of their sympathy and sup
port. All he fears is interference from
Federal authorities.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 14. -The Even
ing Press, in a guarded editorial, urges sol
diers in the United States Army here who
may be discharged and others in military
training, to join the Cuban insurgent
movement. It also suggests that a fund
in aid of the Cubans be raised here and

says that one subscription of $100 has al
ready been offered for this cause.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 14.â The Cuban
junta in this city has him more callers to
day than on any one day since its estab
lishment, all desiring to enlist in the
Cuban army. Not one of them was ac
cepted, as the laws of the United States
prohibit enlisting men here, for foreign
armies.
DENVER, Colo., Dec. 14.â Armed to
the teeth and equipped for war, a com
pany of 300 men, with cannon and camp
utensils, will leave Denver in a few days
to cast their fate with the Cuban insur
gents.
The men wUI be under the leadership
of Dr. H. L. Darnell, who has a brother
in the Cuban Junta in New York City,
with whom he has been in correspondence
for some time.
Dr. Darnell has talked with friends for
some time, but no decision was arrived at
until the reported assassination of Gen
eral Maceo under the flag of truce. Then
the men consulted, became inflamed, and
an accounting was taken.
It was decided that no man would be
taken unless he was able to pay his own
expenses and willing to arm himself, so as
not to be a burden to the insurgents. To
night the arrangements are practically
complete.

TO RECEIVE THE LAURADA.
The Spanish Oovbrument Will Treat the
Filibuiter the Bime an Other Fetneli.
MADRID. Spaijt, Dec. 14. â Admiral
Beranger, Minister of Marine, states that
the maritime commander at Valencia has
been ordered to receive the American
steamer Laurada precisely as he would
any other merchant vessel entering that
port, and to furnish her with every facility
for the continuation of her voyage. Should
she need supplies the marine authorities
will furnish them if private parties refuse
to do so.
The admiral hopes, however, that the
Laurada will avoid Spain, as her presence
at Valencia might cause disorders, with a
view of preventing which a gunboat is
anchored off that place.
"NOBLX GENTLEMEN," INDEED.
Havana Newspapers iiejend the Acts of
Ahutnada, the Assassin.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 14.â A special
from Key West., Fla., says: News comes
from Havana that the Maceo murder story,
as cabled from the United States, has set
the papers wild, and their editorials yes
terday were bitter against the Cubans,
wbo, they declare, have set this false re
port afloat to gain aid in the United
States, and they declaim against the
United States for "listening to such false
stories."
"Spanish honor will not tolerate such
practices much longer," says La Luc da in
a vainglorious editorial, "and the sooner
the nation of shopkeepers knows this the
better. The Spaniards are a nation of sol
diers with untarnished honor, and they
do not propose to be intimidated by
Yankee mercenaries any longer. Notice
is given also to the mongrel Cubans who
hover in the midst of safety hurling their
dirty insults at Spain that they cannot do
this much longer."
The American journals are also ex
coriated for their part in giving aid and
encouragement to the Cuban cause. As
regards the alleged assassination of
Maceo, the papers treat the matter as a
false report spread by the Cuban Junta to
try to aid tbeir cause by making Spain
odious. They say the Marquis Ahumada
is a noble gentleman who would scorn to
do any such act, and they deny that
Maceo had an invitation to meet him.
Rather, they say, Maceo was reeling the
effects of Weyler's resistless onward
march, and deserted his so-called army
and fled to his death. They still say that
Maceo was killed in fair fight and that
Major Cirujeda gained a signal victory
with an inferior force. Denunciations of
Americans appear in all the editorials,
the language in some being very bitter.
Trouble has been impending between
the Cuban and Spanish residents here all
day, and several times collisions were
narrowly avoided. Several of the Spanish
residents attempted to celebrate the kill
ing of Maceo, but the Cubans gathered in
ominous crowds, many of them armed,
and the police interfered to prevent
trouble. Had not this been done blood
would have been spilled. The Cubans
here are loud in their threats against the
Spanish Government, and mass-meetings
will beheld to protest to the American
people and to the American Congress to
investigate the murder of Maceo and if
the truth ascertained be as published to
demand that the belligerency of the
Cubans be recognized.
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Spain Will Hare a Hard Time to Subdue,
the Rebellion.
. NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 14,-The Sun's
Madrid correspondent under. date of No
vember 28 say a: In a recent article Deputy
Rctana reviews the situation in the Puilip
pine Islands. In his opinion 50,000 soldiers
are needed to conquer the insurgents.
Native tribes heretofore hostile to one
another have united in a common effort
against Spam.
The Herald Bays: The insurrection has
greatly that it has become formidable. No
matter how great our ultimate triumph
may be there wilt always remain in the
islands a feeling of hatred between races,
and the problem to be solved there will be
far more difficult than that of Cuba.
The same newspaper urges again the
adoption of "energetic measures." Mail
advices, it says, announce that sevara' of
the leading members of the Katipunan
were soon to be shot, but the truth is that
the news of the shooting has not been
cabled yet.
The sum of $2,800,000 is the estimated
value of the property belonging to Don
Francisco L. Roxas and confiscated by the
Government. At a meeting in Manilla on
tbe occasion of the arrival of some Spanish
re-enforcements one of the speakers ad
vised the troops not to spare the natives
and to treat them as wild beasts. Another
speaker said tbat the islands were far
below the plane of humanity.
The insurrection is spreading through
out tbe island of Tuzon. There is some
excitement in the cities in the province of
Pangasinian, ad joinin : that of Nuera
Ecija, where the rebellion is powerful.
At Iba, in the city of Zamhales prov
ince, the local Katipunan was suprised by
the Spanish authorities. Several arrests
were made and 300 men toot to arms. The
band was successfully pursued by tbe
Guardia Civil.
It. is feared at Manilla that grave dis
turbances may occur there if General
Polavieja does not assume command of the
islands immediately after his arrival
there.
CONSUL FIEGEL'S ASSAILANT.
Ludwig Schutt Recites the Story of His
Alleged Persecution and Is Held
for Further Examination.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 14.â Ludwig
Schutt, the young man who made an un
successful attempt to shoot the German
Consui-General. Herr August Fiegel, Sat
urday -afternoon, was again arraigned be
fore Magistrate Flammer in the Center
street Police Court to-day, where he was
held for the Grand Jury in $2000 bail.
The keepers of the Tombs, where Schutt
was confined Saturday night, reported
thai be had acted rationally, and that
they bad observed nothing to indicate he
was not properly balanced mentally.
Magistrate Flammer again questioned
Schutt, and asked him if he wished to
supplement the statement he had made
Saturday. The young German has evi
dently been thinking the matter over
during the night, and said he wished to
explain way he went to Herr Fiegel's
office in the German consulate, 2 Bowling
Green, with the revolver. Schutt said
that previous to his coming to America be
had been arrested and imprisoned for
three months in Germany on a baseless
charge of extortion, and he contends that
it was nothing more or less than perse
cution.
"After my persecution in Germanyjby
the officials, " Schutt continued, "I did not
know but what I would be called upon to
defend my life, and that the Consul-Gen
eral might be possessed of weapons. I put
the weapon to the Secretary's head to in
timidate Him and to let him understand
that 1 came there not to be trifled with. I
cannot see that I have done anything very
wrong. I simply went there to defend my
life, if necessary, and did not intend to
shoot unless attacked."
Before being returned to the Tombs he
stated that, although bis family in Ger
many was in comfortable circumstances.
he did not think he could attempt to de
fend his case, but let his plea of guilty
stand. It is apparent the prisoner pos
sesses strong socialistic sentiments, as
when asked about his alleged persecution
in Germany he always refers to the high
fatherland sarcastically.
Magistrate Flammer will call the atten
tion of the District Attorney's office to the
case and the probable mental condition of
the defendant.

ALLISON FOR SECRETARY OF STATE
If He Gets the Portfolio There Will be a
Prolonged Struggle in lowa Over
the Seat in the Senate.
DES MOINES, lowa, Dec 14.â Iowa
friend!) of Senator Allison, who have until
now denied that he would go into the
Cabinet, believe he is to be Secretary of
State. His intimates and political friends
announce, in a tone of conviction that
seems inspired, that he will be the next
Premier. The Senator has declined to
make any statement whatever.
General J. M. Baldwin of Council
Bluffs, who has been mentioned for a
Cabinet position in case Senator Allison
declines, and many other intimate
friends of Senator Allison, believe that he
has certainly had an offer of tbe State
portfolio and has been considering it sev
eral days. He is not ready to announce
his decision, but it will be made public
very soon and will undoubtedly be an
acceptance.
In anticipation of this the forces are
already being quietly lined up for the
Senatorial contest for the succession. A.
B. Gummins, National committeeman,
George D. Perkins, J. P. Dolliver, D. B.
Henderson, R. G. Cousins, W. P. Hepburn,
Congressmen, and Governor F. M. Drake
are all named.
The Legislature will meet January 19 in
special session called for other purposes,
and will then elect Allison's successor, if
he goes into tbe C&binet.
Cummins, Dolliver and Perkins will iead
in the fight, which will certainly be a long
and bitter one. Dolliver and Cousins
are considered seiious possibilities, be
cause they are very popular, and in case
of a deadlock either might break it. The
present indication is that either Perkins
or Cummins will be cbosen.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SHARKEY NOT
MUCH HURT
Dr. Lustig Says He Could
See No Signs of Any
Foul Blow.
NAUGHTON'S TESTIMONY
Manager Lynch Denied That He
Was Acquainted With
Dr. Lee.
JULIAN'S TALE OF THE FRAUD.
Long Green Lawrence Has Been In
timidating Witnesses Who Enow
of His Crookedness.
The evidence produced before Judge
Sanderson yesterday in the Fitzsimmons-
Sharkey matter proved conclusively to all
who heard it that Fitzsimmons was tbe
victim of a conspiracy headed oy Long
Green Lawrence's man Wyatt Earp, spe
cial writer for the Examiner.
The testimony of Dr. Lustig created a
sensation in court. He said that after a
careful examination he found that Sbar
key had not been injured in the manner al
leged, and that the swelling was not where
Sharkey was alleged to have been in
jured, and tbat it could have been caused
by tbe use of a hypodermic syringe. He
was not allowed to tell why he and other
reputable physicians bad declined to en
ter into consultation with Dr. Lee, Mr.
Barnes having vigorously objected to any
evidence on that point.
Manager Lynch, Sbarkey's trainer, was
badly rattled on the stand, and told a
cock and bull story of his connection with
the affair to the effect that he was not very
well acquainted with Wyatt Earp; that
why be did not select Hiram Cook as ref
eree was because everybody seemed to
want Cook, and that he refused to admit
Dr. Lustig, the physitian of. the National
Athletic Club, into the dressing-room be
cause tbe officers of the club had incensed
him by declining to put the certificate of
deposit for the stakes into the hands of
the referee nntil the principals had shaken
hands at the beginning of the first round.
W. W. Naughton, the Examiner's sport
ing editor, swore that he was closely
watching the fighters and tbat the alleged
foul blow was on the short ribs or stom
ach on the left side.
The courtroom was jammed with peo
ple and it was evident that very much in
terest was taken in the case. It was an
intelligent audience, too, judging from
the nods and grins with which Mr.
Lynch's amusing narrative was received.
Julian's testimony was interesting, es
pecially where he told of the difficulty
O'Riley experienced in getting a bet from
the Sharkey men until Earp had been
"fixed."
The most remarkable thing in connec
tion with this whole matter is that such
people as Earp, his protege "Long Green"
Lawrence, Sharkey. Lynch, Gibbs and
Needham have succeeded in getting such
a man as W. H. L. Barnes to represent
them.
The General, as a matter of fact, is the
only respectable element on that side of
the case, and he has shown up to the pres
ent time that he desires all tbe truth to
come out in the testimony.
It is evident that the veteran attorney
does not intend interposing technicalities
which in themselves would go to show the
weakness of his clients' case. He believes
in tbe truth of the statements made to
him, and he shows a disposition to fight
his way in this affair on its merits.
Whether he wins or loses, he will make a
creditable showing by not placing bar
riers in the way ot a complete showing up
of the way the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey mill
disgraced sport in this city.
On the opening of court Dr. D D. Lus
tig, one of tbe Examining Board of the
Insanity Commissioners and medical ex
aminer for the National Athletic Club,
swore that as an attache of the club he
had examined Fitzsimmons and Sharkey
before the contest with reference to the
condition of their hearts and lungs, in
order that there might not be an fatal ac
cident, such as sometimes occurs when
one of the contestants is affected with
heart disease.
The doctor was asked particularly with
reference to being barred out of the dress
ing-room to which Sharkey had been taken
immediately after the fight. He knocked
repeatedly at the door, and had others
knocfc for him, and announced that he
desired admission as physician for the
club, but admittance was denied him.
Drs. Rottanzi, O'Brien and Ragan were
present and also demanded admission,
but they were not allowed to enter. On
the next afternoon at 5 o'clock he went to
HEW TO-DAT. ,
Â«V >"M Â«*f
(^ristaias
f|pOCKERS
227 POST St
217 BUSH 512
Sharkey's room with Mr. Groom to ex
amine the fighter and to consult with
other physicians. There were present Drs.
Anderson, Rottanzi, Ragan, Barrett and
Pescia. They examined Sharkey and
went into consultation. Dr. Lee was also
present, but they did not take him into
consultation.
"Why did you not take him into con
sultation with you?" asked Mr. Kowalsky.
General Barnes strenuonsly objected.
Mr. Kowalsicy said : "We offer to prove
that this man Lee was a party to the fraud
and participated in a portion of this fraud;
that he is not a reputable physician, that
he is the character of a man wbo would
be guilty of this sort of thing and that no
reputable physician would have anything
to do with him. We will prove that be is
just exactly what I state him to be and
notoriously so."
The question and offer were ruled out.
The witness went on to tell what the
doctors found. On examining Sharkey
they found two punctures and some dis
coloration and evidences that leeches bad
been applied. The injury was but very
slight and could have been produced by
an injection of water or acidulated fluid
under the skin. If Sharkey had been in
jured in the manner claimed by him there
would nave been an instantaneous swell
ing, causing the most agonizing pain. In
his opinion the injury was not severe
enough to incapacitate Sharkey or to com
pel him to take to his bed. If the fighter
had been injured in the way he claimed
bis condition would have been much
worse the day after the fight than imme
diately after it. Further testimony was
to the effect that feharkey's account of his
injuries and the result of tne physicians'
examination do not harmonize. The doc
tor did not think Bharkey was badly hurt.
The immediate effect of such a blow
would be to produce instant collapse, at
tended with violent pain, vomiting and
other grave constitutional disturbances.
There were no such indications in Shar
key's case.
Robert Fitzsimmons, whose square
Bboulders and lanky form were empha
sized by the long black overcoat he wore,
was (.be next witness.
"Do you know Thomas Sharkey?" asked
Mr. Kowalsky.
"I have seen him," replied Fitzsim
mons.
The answer provoked a laugh, and Shar
key added a grim smile as his contribu
tion to the general hilarity.
"Did you in the eighth round, or in any
round previous to that, strike Sharkey as
he describes?"
"No, sir."
The witness explained further that he
and Sharkey had had an agreement not
to strike each other in the ciincnes and to
"break away fair"; but Sharkay did not
keep his agreement.
la describing the knockout blows the
Australian said: "I delivered two or
three blows to Mr. Sharkey. Then I de
livered a left-hand punch on Mr. Shar
key's face. Then I feinted with my left,
and he threw up both bis arms, thinking
that my left was coming in. Tnis left his
whole body exposed, and immediately
afterward I took the right-hand shift and
delivered a blow in the pit of the stomach.
He came forward witti his hands pressed
on his stomach, and while in that posi
tion I delivered an uppercut in the face
with my left."
Fitzsimmons then described the manner
in wnich he and Julian had objected to
the selection of Wyatt Earp as referee.
According to his statement, when Julian
objected to Wyati Earp Groom and Gibbs
came in and accused them of being
"Kickers," and said that it was too late to
kick; that Earp had been selected by the
club and that tiiere was no use in "kick
ing" about it. Julian and Fitz replied
that it was of no use for them to talk like
that: tnat there would be no figHt unless
they changed the referee. They aud9d
that they had heard of Wyatt Earp, and
they knew what kind of a man he was,
and he could not referee for them.
Groom and Gibbs walked out of the
room and returned shortly and announced
that they could not obtain another referee.
They went on to say that it was of no use
to make a kick at the last moment.
Julian went out on the platform and pub
licly objected to the reieree, stating that
he had heard that Earp was not a respon
sible referee, that Earp was "crooked" and
that there was a job on foot to "do" Fitz
simmons out of tne purse. No notice was
taken of Julian's protest. Earp was on
the platform at ttie time this protest was
made, and said something about his hon
esty, but the witness did not remember
what he said. Julian suggested Young
Mitchell, Colonel Aadrews, Lem Fulda
and Hiram Cook.
Fitzsimmons refused to put on the
gloves and made a speech to the specta
tors, in which he said he had given in to
everything in the contest witn reference
to the gloves, etc., and that as they had
called upon nim to fight he would waive
his objections and go on with the referee,
but he insisted that Sharkey should take
the bandages off his hands.
"I took every precaution to avoid a
foul," added the witness. "I fought very
carefully aod very fair, and I waited until
I could get a good opportunity to deliver
a knockout blow so that every one could
see that it was done fair and honestly.
"Knowing that I had a crocked referee I
had to take precautions. I louitht Shar
key at long distance and didn't get in too
close to him, because if I got mixing up
things with him at short range in body
blows the audience would not be able to
see the blows and some one might claim a
ioul. It would have been impossible for
me to make a mistake and hit a foul blow.
Such a thing never happened in all my
life. A man struck in that way would go
down on his knees and roll around and
holler. I have done it myself when I was
hit, ba he claims he was, with a cricket

ball. I didn't fall backward as Sbarkey
did."
Martin Julian, manager for Fitzsim
mons, was the next witness and told about
how he had suggested the names of Hiram
Cook and others to Lynch in Groom's hat
store. Lynch said that be wanted Julian
distinctly to understand that Sbarkey was
not going to get the worst of it at this
meeting, and that he, Lynch, would not
select a referee until just before the fight.
The witness mentioned the names of
Hiram Cook, Billy Jordan and others as
suitable material for a referee, but Danny
Needham said that they were old dubs
and he had no use for them. Lynch said
that hÂ« would not agree upon any referee
that Julian would %ame; that Julian
should let the club determine the matter.
On a later occasion Groom told Julian
that tbe club had a man for referee who
was fearless and who could not be phazed
and whatever he would say would go.
Julian told Groom that he didn't know
anything about Earp, but tnat he would
mate no objection so long as Earp was a
fair man.
Riley Grannan and Mose Gunst warned
the witness not to accept Earp under any
circumstances. Grannan detailed how for
four or five days he had been around the
racetrack and tbe poolrooms trying to
place money on Fitzsimmons at any rea
sonable odds, but that the Sbarkey men
wanted enormous odds and he could not
place his money.
On the mornine of the day on which he
had called on Julian he saw Joe Harvey
in very confidential talK with Wyatt Earp.
As Harvey was leaving, he asked Earp:
"It's all right now, is it?" and he heard
Earp reply: "You can rely on me." On
that same afternoon Grannan saw several
men who would not bet on anything un
less it was a safe thine, betting thousands
of dollars on S arkey at the racetrack.
Grannan told Julian further that he had
received sufficient information from peo
ple closely connected with the matter to
convince him that a job had been put up
against Fitzsimmons; that no iratter
what way the fight went Fitzsimmons was
doomed to lose.
Mose Gunst came in while Grannan was
telling Julian those things, and Gunst
asked: "How in the name of heaven did
you ever agree to have a man of the stand
ing and reputation that Earp has as
r feree?" Grannan afterward informed
both Julian and Fitzsimmons that he had
positive proof that the decision would be
given to Sbarkey.
On the night of tbe fight Julian called
Earp to one side, and in presence of Billy
Jordan told Earp that he had no inten
tion of hurting Earp's feelings in any
thing he might say, but that it was a
matter of business with Julian.
"I told Earp what I had heard about
him," continued Julian; "that I knew
that he was crooked and that he was fixed
for Sharkey, and that the best thing that
be could do would be to step out and
allow the club to select another referee.
I told him if he got into tnat ring I would
stand up before the audience and tell
what I knew about him. He answered
that he bad been selected by thÂ» club and
he was going to stay, and he walked away
laughing."
Julian told how he and Fitzsimmons
had protested against Earp; how he told
Earp that if he went on the stage he
(Juiian) would insult him, and how he
and his principal finally decided to go on
with the fiaht because the spectators were
howling and it would be said in the morn
ing that Fitz was afraid to meet Sbarkey.
He warned Fitz to fight at long range and
to be very careful not to give the least
opening to any one to claim a foul against
him.
The witness swore that Earp, when
separating the fighters iv the clinch, sev
eral times stuck his fingers into Fitzsim
mons' eyes, and on one occasion came be
hind him and placed his hand- over Fitz
simmons' eyes, preventing him from see
ing Sharkey in the break-aways.
Earp allowed Sharkey to strike Fitz
simmons repeatedly when the men were
breaking away after a clinch, although
Julian repeatedly called his attention to
those fouls. Groom frequently cried,
"Foul! Foul!" but Gibbs angrily re
quested him to close bis mouth, that it
was not any of Groom'? business.
After the fight Groom was indignant.
He said that be was a business man, and
that it would be the last time that lie
would get mixed up with a lot of thieves,
and that his wife was crazy over the affair.
Daniel Hickey, one of Fitzsimmons' sec
onds, was called to the stand and corrob
orated the testimony as to the manner in
which Sharkey had been knocked out.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Mr. Kowalsky called W. W. Naughton,
sporting editor of the Examiner, to the
stand. Mr. Barnes remarked that he un
derstood that only those witnesses about
to leave the State were to be examined,
and that he would not object if tbe other
side would allow him to do tbe same.
Mr. Ackerman of counsel for Fitzsim
mons remarked that he understood that
the whole case was to be presented to the
court. Judge Sanderson remarked that
the case waa not on trial, that he was sit
ting simply to take depositions. He was
willing to consume the rest of the after
noon in taking depositions, but be could
not afford to devote further time to hear
ing them.
Mr. Naughton said that he was watch
ing the fight and was calling off the blows
and movements of the contestants to a
shorthand reporter who sat at bis side.
He had bis eyes on the men all the time
while they were boxing, and he .lid. Dot
observe Fiizsimmons strike Sharkey be
low thÂ«* belt.
Mr. Barnes objected to the question as to
whether the witness saw Suarkey foul
Fitzsimmons.
Mr. Ackerman contended that he de
sired to show Earp's unfairness and bias
in favor of Sharkey. He wanted to prove
that Sbarkey had frequently fouled Fits-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1896.
Simmons and that Earp refused to notice
the foul.
Mr. Kowalsky followed, but the court
ruled the question out.
Mr. Nanghton described the knockout
blows. The blow about the center of the
body was given with Fitzsimmons' rig t
fast and landed on Sharkey's left side,
about the short ribs or the stomach. Then
he struck Sharkey an uppercut blow with
the left on the chin and Sharkey sank
down to the floor. The blow was not hard
enough to have knocked him down. Fitz
simmons did not strike a foul blow during
the fight, so far as tiie witness observed.
Mr. Barnes did not cross-examine Mr.
Naughton.
The next witness was Dennis J. Lynch
of New Hampshire, who for the past eight
or nine months has acted as manager for
Sharkey.
Mr. Barnes ingnired into the witness
interviews with Hiram Cook and Martin
Julian, and the witness denied that Julian
had ever named any persons other than
Hiram Cook and W. W. Naughton. Mr.
Naushton, who was present at the time,
declined to act as referee and gave his
reasons for declining. Lynch denied that
he had ever spoken to Earp about the
fight or that he had recommended Earp
to the club. The smallest bet he ever had
on a right was on this fight, and he never
had any connection with Groom or Gibos
or the National Athletic Club in any way.
He never knew of Sharkey ever having
been connected with the club in any man
ner.
The bulk of Mr. Lyneh's testimony con
sisted of a denial of almost everything
that had Deen sworn against him by the
witnesses on the liizsimmons side. He
explained why he barred Dr. Lustig and
others from the dres-ing-roqm by saying
that there were twelve or fi.teen persons
in the room. Tne room was small and
the burning gas made the air of the room
hot and uncomfortable, and he refused to
allow in any more persona.
The witness denied his acquaintance
ship with Dr. Lee. He told Mr. Dowdell
to bring some good physician to Sbarkey's
room and Dr. Ragan "came there and re
mained with Sharkey until near morning.
Lynch also denied that anything had been
said by him or Cook about what kind of
a decision Cook would give if be were
refereeing a fight between Cook's brother
and a Chinaman. This denial was made
in face of the fact that Mr. Cook pub
lished a card in the Examiner a few days
ago stating that he had told Lynch that
if his (Cook's) brother and a Chinaman
were engaged in a boxing contest he
(Cook) would give thÃ decision in favor of
the Chinaman if the Chinaman showed
the most points.
On the cross-examination by Mr.
Kowalsky, Lynch denied that he received
any salary or compensation whatever for
acting as Sharkey's manager.
"What interest had you then in acting
as his manager? 1 ' asked Mr. KowalsKy.
"The privilege of betting on him," was
the reply.
"Would you not have that privilege
without being bis manager?" was asked.
"Well; I would have more privileges as
his manager/ replied Lynch.
"Oh,'' remarked Kowalsky, "you could
get inside information?"
It appeared on lurtber questioning that
Lynch was a horseracsrand ran his horses
over the same tracks as Earp did, and that
previous to the fight he had never spoken
ten words to Earp at one time on any sub
ject. Had never taken a drink with Earp
and had never been introduced to him.
The witness pointed to a young man
named Feld, who was in oourt chewing
cum, as Having been present in the dress
ing-room with Sharkey after the fight.
There were also present Cooper of the
Chronicle, Smith, Ailen, Needham, Hager,
tne witness and Sharkey.
When it waa announced that Dr. Lustig,
the physician for the National Athletic
Club, was outside and wanted to get into
the dressing- room to examine Sharkey,
Lyncti refused to admit him, because he
(Lynch) was incensed at the action of the
club, the club's officers having refused to
place the money in the hands of the
reieree until the fighters had shaken
bands at the beginning of the first round.
He had previous to that sent Mr. Dowdell
after a physician, although the witness
did not know the nature of the injury al
leged to have been received by Sharkey.
This very thin excuse for barring out
physicians provoked a smile of incredulity
among the audience.
The witness could not say who the per
son was that had brought Dr. Lee to the
room. The witness ordered everyone out
at the suggestion of Sharkey. He bad
never seen Dr. Lee before and didn't
know that Lee was a physician. He
thought at first that Lee had been sent
there by Dowdell. but when Dr. Ragan
arrived he learned otherwise. Lynch
went out of the bedroom into the parlor
and couM not see what Dr. Lee did to
Sbarkey, but he heard Sharsey yell with
pain. He did not see a hypodermic sy
ringe or bottle of iodine in the room.
When Dr. Ragan came Dr. Lea was work
ing on Siiarkey's eye and ear.
Lynch did not accept Hiram Cook as
referee because Sharktjy did not want
CooK. The reason Sharkey had was that
a score of people who had bet money on
F'tsaimmons and wbo had Visited him at
bis training quarters had urged Lynch
to choose Cook. Besides that, Mose Gunst
ha i recommended Cook very highly. Mr.
Julian bad said that he had never met
Cook, and Lynch discovered that before
Julian made that statement be (Julian)
bad visited Cook and nail a talk with him.
So he and Sharkey thought that they had
no- use for Hiram Cook.
The witness denied that he had said to
Mr. Benjamin, a Chronicle reporter, on the
day before the fizht that he and Sbarkey
would not agree upon a referee and that
the club would select the referee.
After Mr. Lynch had denied almost
everything but the fact of his own exist-
ence he was l*t go for the present, the hour
of adjournment having Arrived.
Mr. Barnes announced that he proposed
to put on Sharkey and one or two other
witnesses to-day, and in the course of some
remarks said something whicb caused Mr.
Kowalsky to retort that Mr. Barnes was
going back on his agreement not to resort
to technicalities; that he was claiming a
foul when he was getting the worst ofit,
and that he had buried %t\* hatchet with
the handle sticking toward himself.
After the court had taken an adjourn
ment until 10 o'clock this morning Sbar
key in passing Fitzsimmons on his way
out glared at him savagely and defiantly,
as pugilists are supposed in honor bound
to do. There was a sneer on his lip which
delighted the crowd. Fitzsimmons replied
with the glassy eye and a high-born smile
of contempt.
The taking of the depositions will be re
sumed at 10 o'clock this morning.
BEGINNING TO SQUEAL.
Lawrence Is Trying to Intimidate
Those Who Can Testify to
His Crooked Work.
Andrew M. Lawrence, "Long Green," is
squealing like a pig under a fence. He
knows that Attorney Kowalsky and Mar
tiu Julian have gathered positive evidence
that he is the arch conspirator who influ
enced J. D. Gibbs of the National Athletic
Club to put in Wyatt Earp as referee in
tbe fight.
Ihe evidence to that effect is conclusive
and on the eve of being presented before
the court, and "Long Green" Lawrence is
fretting under the dread of exposure.
There is nothing he will not do to avoid
the expose. He is resorting to all sorts of
measures to avoid being shown up in tba
disgraceful position in which he has placed
himself.
He and his emissaries were about Sun
day and yesterday cajoling and even
threatening people calculated to be called
upon as witnesses in the investigation.
The attorneys on the Fitzsimmons side
got their share of tbe honey and vinegar,
but they have stood tirmly to their client
to date and, as one of them informed a
Call reporter, "not for a million dollars
would I withhold any testimony that can
benefit my client, even if it makes tha
'Monarch's' throne totter and fall all over
'Long Green' Lawrence.
"Tbe disgraceful attitude he baa as
sumed in this affair and the nefarious use
be has made of his position as managing
editor of the Examiner to further his own
ends will come out."

How George A. Morrison
Lost a Prize- Fight in
Ogden.
Gold Brick Swindlers Got "Long
Green's" Bodyguard to Judge
the Fight.
Colonel Hopkins Tells How the Fake
Bad Man Was a Famous Coward
in Arizona.
Many interesting facts about desperado
Wyatt Earp, "Long Green" Andy Law
rence's referee in the Fitzsimmong-Shar
key fight, are now corning to light.
George A. Morrison, an ex-prize-risrbter,
now owner of the Menlo Saloon, 200 Eighth
street, contributes some important facts
concerning Earp's record in a previous
prize-fight.
"It was on September 1, 1891,"" said Mr.
Morrison yesterday, "that I had a prize
fight with Jim Williams at the Ogden
Opera-house, Ogden, Utan. The bunko
steerers, sure-thing men and gold-brick
swindlers worked Earp off on me as ref
eree. The re-uit was I was drugged, jobbed
and lost the tight. My backer, the well
known Harry P. Hyads, lost $8000 on the
job."
Mr. Morrison's story is very interesting.
As he never saw Earp before the fight, he
bears no malice and the recital of the facts
speaks for itself.
"Oar fight was before the Ogden Athletic
Club, of which Henry Perry was presi
dent," said Morrison to a Call reporter
yesterday, "and Perry is a wealthy young
man of high standing.
"All had agreed upon Tom Painter of
Evanston, Wyo., for referee. Kelly, Wil
liams' backer, agreed to the same thing.
Everybody thought the fight was on the
square until it was started. Well, just as
the show was about to begin John Russell,
a well-known sure-thing man and gold
brick operator, together with one George
Lewis, made a kick, and finally they sug
gested Earp as referee. To this my
trainer, George La Blanche, agreed, al
though few of us knew Earp. My friends
and myself felt so sure of my victory that
nobody seemed to care wbo was referee.
"I was in fine condition when I came
from my training quarters. I ate at the
Reed Hotel that evening, a few hours be
fore the fight. Shortly after eating I got
ill, and by the time I was well into the
fight I could not sea well. I would hit at
my man when he was ten feet away,
imagining him to be right before me,
I could not deliver a good blow
to save my life, and I was simply
knocked out Dr. Corey of Ogden
formerly of Cheyenne, examined me
and be stated that I was suffering from a
large dose of belladonna. Ido not know
who gave it to me, but I know that a band
of crooks and sure- thing men were crazy
to have Earp as referee. I know that one
of those men, George Lewis, a desperate
sure-thing man, was shot and killed soon
after by a sheepherder whom he had
robbed of $17,000, and I know some others
who were closely connected with him
skipped from the country soon after the
fi lit. 1 ieit sure that I had been drugged
soon after I stepped into the ring, for I
tripped and fell, my eyes were almost
useless and my head was heavy. I also
know that Wyatt Earp was referee, and
that he just suited the desperate gang of
thugs and highbinders that infested the
country."
Charles H. Hopkins, a veteran news
paper man of St. .Louis, knew Wyatt Earp
and his family well in 1880. Colonel Hop
kins was at that time a mining reporter for
the Tombstone Epitaph. Speaking of the
Earps Colonel Hopkins lately said to a Re
public reporter:
"There were five of the Earpsâ Virgil,
Wyatt, Warren, Julian; and Jessie, their
sister.
"All the boys were excellent types of
frontier bad men. All this talk about
Wyatt Earp being a brave man and on the
square makes me tired. He was brave
enough in a certain way, but there is good
reason to doubt if he ever possessed that
kind of bravery that will make a man dash
into a burning building to save a woman's
life. As to being on the square â well, he
was as square as a circle. The Earps were
the leaders of a gang of gentlemen that
operated in Cochise County, and an oppo
sition gang was led by John Behan. Wyatt
Earp was City Marshal of Tombstone and
Bahan was Sh-riff of Cochise County.
Botn men hated each other.
" 'Doc' Holliday, who has grown famous
as the Wells-Fargo shotgun messenger,
was a member of the Earp crowd. Every
body has read about how Holliday stopped

Prize-Fight in Ogden in JB9J, Wyatt Earp Referee.
stage-robbing in Arizona. Well, he did
stop it to a certain extent â that is to say,
nobody could rob a stage who was Holli
day's enemy. The Earps stood in with
Holliday and his crowd of Wells-Fargo
messengers, and every time we would hear
of a stage that carried a lot of money or
bullion being held up Wyatt Earp would
collect a posse of nis gang and start out
to run the robbers down. If they could
manage to catch any of the. 'rustlers' of
the opposition crowd they would hang
them without ceremony, come back to
town and explain how they tracked the
road agents down.
"Many incidents led a good many
people to think that Earp was not so game
as he might bs; so one night a job was
put up to test him. Just about dusk a
crowd of men got on tbe flat roof of an
adobe building, commenced firing at a
great rate, and threw a dummy figure of
a man over into the street. Earp was a.
tbe town pump, about 100 feet away, and
saw it all. It looked like a case of real
trouble, requiring the interference of the
Marsha], out Earp disappeared and was
not seen around his usual haunts until
things bad quieted down. After this
Earp's nerve shrank in the estimation of
tbe inhabitants of Cochise County, and
the suspicion that the gang was impli
cated in most of the stage robberies led to
a decision that the town could get along
without them.

THE POPULISTS
Scores Senator Hoar for
His Unkind Words as
to Nebraska.
Rather Heated Arraignment of
Massachusetts by the West
ern Statesman.
But Platt of Connecticut Sneers at
the Speech and Terms It "Clap-
Trap" Talk.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 14.â 1n the
Senate to-day anolher blast was also given
against Turkey in tne shape of resolutions
passed by a church congregation in New
Hampshire, presented and approved by
Senator Gallinger of that State, declaring
that Armenian outrages should be sup
pressed by the civilized powers, even at
tbe cost of tbe dismemberment of the
Turkish empire.
A resolution was offered by Peffer (Pop.)
of Kansas, and laid on the table for the
present, for the appointment of a commis
sion â one from each of the four parties,
Republican, Democratic, National Demo
cratic and Populist, and one other to be
chosen by the fourâ to examine and study
the genera! subject of finance In reference
to its practical relations to business.
A resolution offered last week by Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska, denying the constitu
tional power of any State to impair the
obligation of contracts, was taken up and
made the basis of * speech by him in
Which he defended the Populist Governor
and Legislature of Nebraska from all im
putations of an intention to enact legisla
tion hostile to capital, and declared that
all such fears were groundless. He
especially disclaimed all purpose to act in
hostility to railroad companies. In the
course of his speech, he criticized severely
the charge made by Senator Hoar of Massa
chusetts, in a recent speech in Boston, as
to the State of Nebraska having been (vot
ing for Bryan and free silver) "engaged in
a crazy attempt at revolution and a
passionate crusade of dishonor." Such a
statement, Allen declared, was unwar
ranted, dishonest and ungracious. Hoar
explained and justified his language and
applied to the resolution.the term "puerile
and trifling."
Platt (R.) of Connecticut also sneered
at it as "claptrap." It was referred to
the Judiciary Committee.
The immigration bill was taken up and
went over under an agreement that a vote
shall be taken on its passage at 4 p. m.
on Thursday.
The resolution of the House for the holi
day recess was referred to the Committee
on Appropriations.
Tbe Senate then took up and passed all
the pension bills on the calendar (fifty
five).
Senators Sherman (R.) of Ohio, Elkins
(R.) af West Virginia and Mitchell (D.)of
Wisconsin were appointed by the Vice-
President as the inauguration committee
on the part of the Senate.
The credentials of Samuel Douglas Mc-
Enery as Senator from the State of Illi
nois to succeed Senator Blancbard were
presented by Blanchard and placed on file.
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas introduced a
joint resolution for the appointment by
the President of the United States of a
committee of four, one from each of the
political parties â Republican, National
Democrats, Democrats and Populists â
who shall select a fifth, and shall consti
tute a National monetary commission to
examine and study tbe general subject of
finance in reference to its practical rela
tions to business. He asked that it be
laid on the table, and said that he would
speak on it after the holidays.
Hale (R.) or Maine introduced a concur
rent resolution for the holiday recess from
Tuesday, December 22, to Tuesday, Jan
uary 5, and it was referred to the Commit
tee on Appropriations.
The following bill was taken from the
calendar and passed: Constituting a new
division of the ea-tern judicial district of
Texas, and providing for holding terms of
court at Beaumont. Tex.
Senator Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska ad
dressed the Senate on a resolution Intro
duced by himself last week, declaring tbe
â acredness of contracts, indulging in a
refutation of the charge that the Legisla
ture in States which had elected Populist
Legislatures, such as Nebraska and Kan
sas, will be such as to retard, if not pro
hibit, the enforcement of legal obligations
and of legal contracts. So far as Nebraska
is concerned, he said, "there is not the
slightest ground to fear that anything will
be done that will in any respect violate
legal obligations or place a barrier across
the pathway of their prompt and effectual
enforcement." He continued: "The Po
pulist party in Nebraska is composed of
men who understand quite well the in
violability of ali contracts, as well as the
sacredness of public and private property
and the rights of citizens. The party was
not born to destroy, but to build up and
make more secure the rights of all, and to
give to all that full measure of justice
to which their position as members of so
ciety entitles them.
"Those who live elsewhere and have, or
may have, obligations against the State,
or any of its subdivisions or citigens, will
not be deprived of entering our courts
and enforcing them as fully and com
pletely as they can in the courts of their
own State. They will find no- prejudice
against them or their cause if meritorious.
Our Judges will compare very favorably
with those of the oldest States of the
Union in point of ability, integrity, and a
knowledge of the duties of their offices.
They will hold the scales of justice im
partially between residents and non-resi
dents; they will enforce all legal obliga
tions in their letter and spirit and defeat
those in violation of law; they are, in
every conceivable respect, abreast of tbe
times, and fully armed and equipped, by
character and education, in the impartial
discharge of their duties without fear or
favor.
'The Eastern holders of stocKs in our
railway corporations sometimes express
fear of hostile legislation, and I desire to
say to them that such a feeling is ground
less. While Ido not doubt that the Legis
lature will enact measures looking to the
prevention of over-capitalization, wild and
reckless management, and will take strong
grounds against railways interfering in po
litical matters and favoring one political
party fey the free service of tne ir trains to tbe
rigid exclusion of others from a like privi
lege, yet, so iar as equitable and just pas
senger and freight rates are concerned,
there will be nothing done of which any
fair-minded man may justly complain."
There would be no disposition to legis
late so as to injure the beet-sugar fac
tories of ths State, he declared, as had
been charged would be done, aud he re
plied vigorously to a quotation from a
banquet speech said to have been made by
Senator Hoar before the Home Market
Ciub in Boston in November, in which
the Massachusetts Senator was repre
sented as characterizing the efforts of the
Democrats and Populists, especially of
Nebraska and Kansas, as "a crazy at
tempt at revolution and passionate cru
s-ade of dishonor."
"Nebraska," said Senator Allen, in re
piy to tnis, "has never engaged in a revo
lution that was not pacific and lofty in
its character and directly within the
province of a Christian Government.
Massachusetts possesses nothing in Ne
braska that should entitle her foremost
man to speak of our people as the senior
Senator from that State has done. While
we accord to Massachusetts her rights
and look upon her as an older and there
fore a more compact and better organized
community than ours, we do not look to
her for advice on a political, social, scien
tific, religious or any other question.
"I do not speak of this misrepresenta
tion as strongly as I feel, but I must be
permitted to say that it was an unwar
ranted, gratuitous, open and flagrant in
sult to an honest, intelligent, poor but
struggling Christian people. The per
centage of illiteracy in Nebraska is smaller
than iti Massachusetts. Her churches and
schools, according to her population, are
fully as numerous and as well equipped to
impart Christian and secular education as
are those of Massachusetts. Our chari
table institutions are among the finest of
the world: our people are industrious,
economical, honest, intelligent, persever
ing and loyal.
â¢'lt cannot be truthfully said of Ne
braska that she joined In a crazy and dis
honorable crusade to enforce the provi
sions of a brutal fugitive slave law. Her
people have never been guilty of mobbing
one of their own citizens for no greater
offense than raising bis voice against op
pression and wrong. The stillness of her
atmosphere has not been broken by the
appeals for assistance of cringing men and
defenseless women and children, guilty of
no offense but fleeing to her soil for free
dom, only to be captured and placed in
chains by her citizens and returned to
servitude for a reward. Whatever may be
said of Nebraska, she has not been guilty
oi any of these crimes against the laws of
God and civilization. She has never dis
honored her foromost citizen, when liv
ing, for extolling the cause of liberty and
placed wreaths on his grave when dead,
because he had been the friend of liberty.
She has done none of these, and no dis
honor of this kind attaches to her name
or imperils her glory.
"There are those who have been born and
live in Massachusetts who have conceived
a bitter hatred for the West and everything
Western and who believe that neither good
nor intelligence can be found in that sec
tion of the country. But the patriotism
of tbe people of Nebraska is as broad and
limitless as her plains; their Christianity
and sense of duty are as pure and un
tainted as her atmosphere. Never, thus
far in the history of the State, has she been
guilty of dishonor, and never, as long as
intelligence is predominant and God reigns
in tbe hearts of her people, will she be
guilty of anything that will place a stain
upon her good name or that will cause her
to be spoken of by honest, intelligent and
fair-minded men in a disparaging man
ner."
Platt (R.) of Connecticut referred to the
resolution as "claptrap," and moved to
amend it by adding to it these words:
"And that, in the opinion of the Senate,
no law should be passed by Congress the
effect of which would be to impair the ob
ligation of contracts," and he asked Allen
whether he would accept that amend
ment.
"I do not care either to accept or reject
it." Allen said. "Let it go to the Judiciaty
Committee with the resolution."
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas took up the
question and declared that so far as Kan
sas was concerned its people were brave,
honest and generous, and that its Legisla
ture bad never don 6 anything to impair
the obligation of contracts.
The resolution and amendment were
referred to the Judiciary Committee.
The bill amending the copyright laws,
particularly in regard to dramatic pro
ductions, together with the House amend
ment, was laid betore the Senate and the
amendment concurred in. The bill
makes piracy a misdemeanor and makes
an injunction granted by one Circuit
Judge enforcible in any other circuit.
The effect of the amendment is that the
injunction shall not be granted without
notice to defendants. The bill now goes
to the President.
At 2 o'clock, when the morning hour
closed, the immigration bill came up as
the unfinished business, but the immi
gration bill then went over on account of
the absence of Gibson (D.) of Maryland,
but with the agreement that a vote on its
passage would be taken next Thursday at
4 o'clock.
The amendments of the House to the
Senate bill relating to the tax on alcohol
used in manufacture and the arts were
disagreed to and sent to a conference com
mitteeâSenators Platt (R.) of Connecti
cut, Aidrich (R.) of Rhode Island and
Jones (D.) of Arkansas being appointed
conferees on the part of the Senate.
The Senate then took up the pension
calendar and passed fifty-rive private pen
sion bills, nearly ail of them for increase
of pension. Then after a short executive
session the Senate at 3:30 adjourned until
to-morrow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1896.
Morse (R.) of Massachusetts demanded
a vote ou the bill amending the laws regu
lating the granting of liquor licenses in
the District of Columbia, wnich was pend
ing when the House adjourned last Friday.
Babcock (R. ) of Wisconsin demanded a
division which resulted ayes 4Â«, noes 23.
He then made the point of no quorum and

The call resulted ayes 132, noes 31. Bab
cock renewed bis point of no qnorum and
Morse demanded a call of the House.
Pending the call Mabanv (R.) of New
York moved to adjourn. The latter mo
tion was defeated, ayes 34, noes 84.

quorum and the enerossment of the bill

BYGONE STARS
ENTER THE RING
Great Gathering of Pugs
at the Mace-Donovan
Benefit.
The Old Boys Went at Each
Other in Earnest After Be
ing Warmed Up.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 14.â About
2000 people attended the Mace-Donovan
benefit at the Broadway Athletic Club to
night. In addition to the heavy-weight
champion of the world and the one
time American middle-weight champion,
a host of other bygone stars were in evi
dence. The science of the present day
was represented by Champion James J.
Corbett. Among others the old veterans,
Joe Rourke and John Donaldson, sparred
and got a great ovation.
A tremendous burst of applause greeted
John L. Sullivan as he was announced to
mafce a short speech. He received anothei
ovation as he retired.
Billy Edwards, the ex â¢ lightweight
champion, and Arthur Chambers of Phila
delphia, his old rival, then srarred three
rounds. Chambers was quite fat, but
Biily was down fine. They did not bother
about the gong, bat sat down when they
were tired, and tbe three rounds were
more than enoueh for them.
Bob Armstrong, the colored heavy
weight from Chicago, was pounds heavier
and inches taller than Tommy Kelly of
Hoboken, and the latter had a hard time
to keep away for three rounds.
Barney Aaron and Dooney Harris fol
lowed. Barney got a big floral horseshoe
before he put on the gloves.
George Dixon was heartily cheered when
he was introduced, as was also Kid La
vigne.
A great reception was accorded to Cor
bett as he came into the ring to box three
rounds with Jimmie McVey, his sparring
paitner. The champion looked in good
shape.
Mace and Donovan entered the ring at
10:30. Parson Davies acted as master of
ceremonies and announced that there was
to be no decision, that the set-to was to
be a scientific exhibition of a friendly na
ture. In the third round Mace shoved his
left in straight a couple of times and Mike
spnt a pretty hot one to the jaw. They
did tome pretty lively tapping in the last
round and the old fellows looked to be in
earnest when Parson Davies called time.
They shook hands, and there were loud
cries of "draw!"
HALE CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.
Rice Dec/a red to Be Champion of America.
Distribution of Prizes Won at
the Six- Day Race.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 14-The clos
ing scenes of the big six-day bicycle race
held at Madison-square Garden last week
were enacted at the Hotel Bartholdi to
day. At noon the successful competitors
gathered at the hotel and received in gold
the reward for their long w eary hours of
pedaling. The presentation ceremonies
took place in the big suite of room s occu
pied by William J. Bryan while he was in
this city. Several hundred sports gathered
to get a look at the riders after their big
task of last week. All of tbe men who
took part in tne race, except Reading,
were present, and most of them looked to
be in good condition. Reatiing is at Belie
vue Hospital, but will probably be out in
a few days. Hale, the winner, received
$1200. He was unable to get ail the big
double-eagles into his pockets, so he used
his cap for a money-bag.
Proprietor Robley made the presents
tioii speech and declared Hale tbe cham
pion of the world. He received $800 in
goid for bis share and was declared cham
pion of America. For finishing third
Reading was awarded $500 and $50 for re
maining on his wheel the greatest number
of hours at a stretch. The other prizes
were: Forster, $350; Schock. $300; Pierce
$200; Smith, $150; Taylor, $125; Ashing
ton, $100; Moore. $100, and Maddux $15.
When the other prizes had been
awarded Managers Powers and Kennedy
gave Cassidy, Gannon, McLeod and Flick
$75 each, although neither was entitled to
any money.
Hale will soon start on a tour of the
country giving exhibitions. Most of the
others will go to Washington to take part
in the six-day race to be held there, begin
ning December 28.
The management has decided to hold a
six-day race annually, and have already
secured the garden for next December.

Magnire Says That Powers Accepted
the Plans of Collis Without
Asking Questions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 14.âSena
itors and Representatives in Congress have
received from Now York the following 1
circular:
"On behalf of substantial and represen
tative interests in the Union and Central
Pacific railroads we respectfully submit
that the rights of the Government, as well
as of the individual security holders of
those roads, will be best subserved if the
debate on the Pacific Railroad debt be not
advanced to a date anterior to February 1,
1897. The grounds of this position are the
following:
"As to the Union Pacific: The bill is
nothing more than a proposition to con
vert third and fourth mortgage bonds into
first mortgage bonds on this railroad.
Tbe majority of the committee has oeen
misled into this anomalous position. If
Congress were to consent to subject the
Government's second, mortgage to third
and fourth mortgages (which we do not
for a moment believe) the present first
mortgage bondholders, whom we repre
sent, would never consent to share their
prior lien with inferior incumbrances. If
tbe bill should pass they would fight this
scheme in the courts. Hence, no time
would be gained, even if a measure so re
pugnant to the sense of justice were to be
enacted.
"As to the Central Pacific, the stock
holders of this road are not engaged in the
prosecution of a plan of reorganization,
based on the assessment of their shares
for tbe payment of $34,000,000 cash into
the United States treasury, in considera
tion of tbe transfer to them of the Govern
ment's second mortgage. As about $52,
-000,000, out of the $68,000,000 of capital
stock of this road, is held in Europe, the
few weeks of time indicated above, are
necessary to consummate this arrange
ment so desirable for the Government.
Moreover, the proposed bill requires the
consent of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company to changes in its lease to the
Southern Pacific Company, in order to
make tbe proposed legislation effective.
This consent, we can confidently say, the
stockholders of the Central Pacific Rail
road Company will not give, as such con
sent would constitute the annulment of
their rights in the property. Therefore,
time would be merely wasted in consider
ing or passing a measure confessedly sub
jest to the performance of an impossible
condition.
"Being amenable to the objection of
uselessness as well as injustice we submit
that this measure should not be hastened
until the real parties in interest can pre
sent formal propositions, now maturing,
and more favorable to the Government
than the pending bill. Very respectfully,
"L J. Morkison."
Judge Maguire said to The Call corre
spondent to-night: "lam not at all sur
prised at the communication. It repre
sents substantially the condition of affairs
we have long known to exist. In the mat
ter of the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany the directors and others, who have
been urging the passage of the various re
funding bills, have been doing so in utter
contempt and disregard ot the right of the
stockholders. No proposition has ever as
yet been made to the Government by the
stockholders, or by any person or persons
authorized to represent them in the
matter.
"If it be assumed that the directors
have any such authority by virtue of their
office (although the stockholders have not
been consulted), yet even the directors
have never submitted or suggested a
proposition. The House committee seems
to have proceeded upon the presumption
that tne directors are authorized to act
for the stockholders and that Mr. Hnnt
ington controls the directors. The Pow
ers bill represents Mr. Huntington's
plan, accepted without any questions be.
ing asked as to whom he represents or by
what anthority he presents a plan. Of
course our fight against the bill is based
on other objections alogether, but from
the standpoint of the United Stat es Gov
ernment these considerations are im
portant.
"I heard a rumor to-day that the re
fandine bill would be taken up this week,
but members of the Pacific roads commit
tee denied it."
SECRETARY CARLISLE'S VIEWS.
i Would Increase . the Currency by Issu
;.; ing Gold Certificates. ,":"
â  WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 14.â The
following letter from the Secretary of the
Treasury I was made public to-day:
: Franklin Haven, Esq., President Merchants'
National Bank, Boston, â Sib: Replying to
your favor of the 24th of November, written
in behalf of the ' Boston banks, asking for the
issue of gold certificates under the authority
granted ;in Â» section 12 of the act of July 12,
1882, 1 am not prepared to grive the necessary
order. ; After the reserve has once fallen be
low $100,000,000, and the issue of such certifi
cates has I been < stopped, it is not certain that
the Secretary of the Treasury, especially in
view of existing conditions, would be justified
in resuming their issue. " ;:.,'â¢
'? It has ; been. the j experience of the depart
ment In j the | past that the normal increase of
the (told j reserve; caused ,by , the exchange of
paper currency for gold is checked by the issue
of gold certificates and, in fact, upon various
occasions considerable amounts of gold have
been withdrawn by the. presentation, of notes
for redemption and immediately redeposited
,in exchange ! for, gold ; certificates. Moreover,
the House of Representatives of the Fifty-third
Congress, at ; its i third session," passed a ; bill
discontinuing | the I coin I issue entirely, and it
is the intention of the department to present
the subject again at a very early date. As the
amount of gold reserve is largely, determined
from time to time by the available amount of
paper in circulation, it < seems inadvisable ; at
this time especially, to increase the volume of
that currency the issue of gold certificates.

Garden City Cyclers Planning for a Race
by "Bunt" Smith Against
Time.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Dec. 14.â The Garden
City cyclers are discussing the proposition
of having "Bunt" Smith ride a mile
straightaway with a locomotive for a pace
maker. Thy plans will be similar to those
employed by E. E. Anderson of Bt. Louis,
who a few months ago rode a mile behind
an eneine in 1:03. Preparations are now
being made for the event, and if the
cyclers secure the privilege from the
Southern Pacific, planks will be laid be
tween the rails of the Southern Pacific be
tween here and Gilroy for a distance of
about two miles. There are several
stretches where such a race could be suc
cessfully held.
Smith is a fast and reckless rider and
wants to lower Anderson's record. Several
months ago Smith rode five miles over the
Milpitas course in 10:20.
A great many of the cyclers are in favor
of holding weekly race meets for amateurs,
and the plan may shortly be tried. Only
riders who have never won a race will be
elegible for entry, the idea being to give
inexperienced riders a chance to show what
is in them. No admission will be charged
and the prizes will be of small value.
Tbe minstrel entertainment of the
Garden City Cyclers will be given Monday
evening, December 2L
SURVET OF MED WOOD CREEK.
JUajor Davis Reports on the Work of Im
proving the Channel.
WASHINGTON, D. G, Dec 14.â The
Secretary oi War to-day transmitted to
the House of Kepresentatives a letter of
Chief of Engineers Crai^hili, containing
the report of Major Davis, Corps of En
gineers, on the survey of Redwood Creek,
California, made in compliance with the
last river and harbor act. Major Davis
says that the Government expended $103,
-445 from 1884 to 1890; says that it is use
less to do any more dredging in that
stretch of the channel between the town
and the tannery, for this part of the chan
nel is bare and ihe remaining two-thirds
has less than than two feet of water.
The slough, half way between the bay
and creek, widens out, iorming the mid
dle ground, with two channels and a mud
bank between. To the westward of this
middle ground there is a deep semi
circular slough, with a bar of two feet at
its upper end, which can be navigated by
the clans of sailing vessels using the
slough, but with some difficulty, owing to
its .peculiar course. By closing this
slough, by means of a dyke, and improving
either channel around the middle ground,
a five-foot channel might be obtained.
Tbe westmost channel is the one to be
preferred, as it is straighter. The esti
mated cost of the dyke is $3000 and the
dredging is $5400.

CONVENTION Of
LABOR LEADERS
Sixteenth Annual Gather
ing of the Federation
of America.
President Samuel Gompers Makes
a Report on the Progress
of the Year.
While Conditions Have Not Improved
to the Extent Expected Mem
bership Increases.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 14.â The six
teenth annual convention of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor assembled at
Odd Fellows' Temple at 10 o'clock this
morning.. It is the largest in number and
most important meeting ever held by the
federation. The 125 delegates are in at
tendance, some of them from Europe.
The convention was called to order by
President Samuel Gompers. Fred Basely,
president of the Cincinnati Central Labor
Council, addressed the delegates on behalf
of the local committee, and E. J. Denny of
the Iron Molders' Union on behalf of tbe
city.
Mayor Caldwell delivered an address of
welcome, which was responded to by
President Gompers. The temporary or
ganization was then effected.
When the afternoon session was called
to order seats on the stage were accorded
to Samuel Woods and John Martinson of
Great Britain and to Louis Vigouroux of
France, all of whom are among the fore
most leaders of the cause of labor in their
respective countries.
The committee on credentials not being
ready to report a recess was taken. It *as
almost 4 o'clock when the convention was
again called to order and the report on
credentials read.
After the reading and acceptance of the
credentials committee's report a resolu
tion to exclude from the hall during the
convention the representatives of all non
union newspapers was passed by almost a
unanimous vote of the convention.
Appointments of committees were then
made by President Gompers.
After submitting the committees to the
convention, which promptly ratified the
appointments, President Gompers called
the vice-president to preside and read his
annual report. He said in part:
In the matter of our amendment t o the
eight-hour law, we have had many mam
festations of opposition from quarters
which should have favored it. I would rec
ommend that this convention decide that the
representatives of this federation be constantly
at the service of the Government dur
ing the session of Congress to guard and
further the legislation which our or
ganizations demand in the interest of
labor. While industry and commerce have just
about emerged from the panics of 1893-95,
the changes or improvements have been very
meager. There has not been that industrial
revival looked and hoped lor aud which we
had a ristht to anticipate after the crisis
through which we have passed. Our member
ship during the year has increased nearly
100,000.
The report of the secretary will show that
there were 207 charters issued to local
unions, as compared with 141 last year; that
eleven National and International trades
unions have become affiliated with, the
American Federation of Labor during the
year, and also twenty-three central labor
bodies during the same period.
As per instructions the executive committee
has set to work for the purpose ot securing
some concessions for an eight-hour work day.
A number of unions made tbe demand and se
cured it by strikes. A much larger number
had the reduction conceded to them without
even the necessity oi ceasing their work.
Mr. Gompers urged the holding of a
series of simultaneous mass-meetings by
wage-workers on National holidays and
said: "We earnestly seek the sincere
co-operation of all fair - minded men
and women of our town and de
clare openly and unequivocally our
purpose to demand the general enforce
ment of the eight-hour work day, May 1,
1898, and to that end we shall bend our
every effort."
Tbe session closed with the reading of
the annual reports of the secretary and
treasurer, which showed tbe organization
in good financial condition.
MADE INSANE BY JEALOUSY.
Ernest L Chase Cuts (he Throat of H s
Wife and Kills Himself With the
Same Weapon.
DETROIT, Mich., Dec. 14.â A shocking
double tragedy toot place in this city
to-day. Ernest L. Chase cut the throat of
his wife and then with the same weapon
cut his own throat from ear to ear and
fell dead beside her. The tragedy took
place early this morning in the rooms
occupied by the couple, and when the
tragedy was discovered the two bodies lay
in a pool of blood on the floor.
The tragedy was the climax of a life of
vu happiness. Chase was 38 years of age
and his wife 6 years younger. He was of
a very jealous disposition, frequently ac
cusing his wife of undue familiarity with
other men, an accusation which, his
friends say. was wholly without founda
tion. For a day or two he has been very
morose in his manner, again repeating
the usual statements about bis wife and
accusing her of unfaithfulness. It is be
lieved that he finally became insane
through brooding over the matter and
that the tragedy was the result of this in
sane jealousy.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec 14.â The
Central Trust Company of New Yorfc filed

POSSE STARTS ON
DUNHAM'S TRAIL
Goes Prepared to Take the
Murderer Dead or
Alive.
Ex-Marshal Gard Confident That
Hs Is After the Right
Man.
Has Been Working on the Case Con
tinuously Sine.2 the C mpbell
Tragedy.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 14.â Late this
afternoon Sheriff Lyndon of Santa Clara
County, ex-United States Marshal George
E. Gard and Detective Harry Johnson of
Los Angeles, Deputy J. J. Ward and De
tective O. J. Ellsworth of San Diego, and
a strantior supposed to be L. E. Hickok of
Los Angeles, left for the Mexican line on
the searcn for murderer James Dunham.
They intended boarding the Nationaf
City and Otay train and riding as far as
Tia Juana", but changed their minds and
took two stout rigs, driving from this
city. They intend to drive most of the
rsight. Their destination, as nearly as can
be learned, is Dunham's bee ranch,
thirty-five miles ea3t of this city, on the
Mexican line.
The men were supplied with provisions
for a week, and each was "armed to the
teeth." Detective Harry Johnson, as
well as Sheriff Lyndon, took a pair of
handcuffs along. If possib>e the officers
will capture Dunham al^ve, in order to se
cure the $1000 regard offered by Governor
Budd.
Before the party left an interview was
secured by a Call representative with
Marshal Gard. Oh account of an old
friendship between the two Mr. Gard was
more confidential than he generally is to
newspaper men when on an important
mission.
"I came down here," he said, "in re
sponse to a request from Sheriff Lyndon
of San Jose, who inclosed a letter from
Detective O. J. Ellsworth of this city.
"Ellsworth recited how his brother had
been in Mexico, about thirty miles below
here, and how two Mexicans had told him
they had seen Dunham and talked with
him. They knew Him well, having worked
for him on his bee ranch. They watched
him and found tnat he paid a visit to his
ranch one night. He is now hiding not
far from the ranch.
"This, taken together with the fact that
Dunham's brother was here week before
last and also visited the ranch, is decidedly
suspicious. Well, I have interviewed Ells
worth and bis brother and picked up sev
eral other points. Meantime Sheriff Lyn
don wired me tnat he had secured
other independent information. When
he got here last night we
talked the whole thing over, and
we find that his information ana mine
dovetail in so that both are strengtheded,
if not positively confirmed. There is every
probability now that we are on the track
of Dunham, and that we will have a hard
time getting at him. I can't tell you
where Lyndon got later information. I
can only say it is very important and I
feel sure we will get our man.
"We are going to try and get Dunham
alive. You know the Governor's reward
of $1000 is for the arrest and conviction of
Dunham. Now, if we have to kill him,
does that convict him? You see, to get
that reward we must bring him in alive.
Aside from the Governor's reward there is
about $1200 offered lor Dunham's capture.
"This story of $10,000 being on his head,
dead or alive, is all rot. If there should
be $2000 clean ca3h given as a reward I
would be surprised. But the idea is
abroad that there is $10,000, and this has
led every man, woman and child in the
country to figuring and sticking in his oar
and trying to get a finger in the pie. So
we have to move very cautiously, or some
body will 'leak,' and Dunham wilt get
wind of the thing.
"We will leave af soon as we can get on
the trail of this man who we have reason
to believe, is Dunham, It isn't very far
away. We will not be gone more tuan
three or four days. Now, if you see me in
this town alone you can make up your
mind that hâ l is to pay and that he have
located him. 1 will hurry back
here and keep the wires sizzling to
the City of Mexico to President
D az, General Torres and Judge
Sepulveda, and within twenty-foar hours
we'll have every ruraie in the lower coun
try at our service. I've done that before
in the State of Chihuahua. Tnere is a
way to brin? a man out of Mexico with
out a requisition, if it Is handled right.
So if you see me here alone you can take
that as a tip that we've got him located
and that the man is Dunham, If v.c
come back here alone you can make up
your mind the jig is up."
"Then Dunham is below the line?' 1
"Well, he may be before we reach him,"
replied Detective Gard.
"But there is a telegraph office at En
senada."
"Yes, I know there is an office there,
but San Diego is nearer and has the ad
vantage of being on American soil. We
don't want any Mexican red tape
blocking us when we get into
action. We have picked out our
men and every one is a brave and ex
perienced officer. We know Dunham is
desperate and will tieht to the death be
fore being captured, but we hope to get
him and alive at that. Of course we shall
not hesitate to kill him if we find it neces
sary."
"But you are apt to find trouble with
the Mexicans if you enter Mexico without
permission."
"Oh, that's all fixed; don't worry about
that. We have been working on this
Dunham business for six months, tooth
and nail, and now we are on the right
track. We don't intend to be stopped Dy
the Mexicans. They will help us when
we want them. In the meantime they
will keep their hands off and let us work."
It was learned late to-night that Elmer
Ellsworth, the man who saw the two
Mexicans below the line, and learned
from them regarding their talk with
Dunham, that he was then at Guadalupe
Valley eighty miles south of San Diego.
He was in charge of a ranch there at the
time.
"He is now in the country and cannot
be seen. His story was that two Mexicans
who knew Dunham told him that they
bad seen Dunham, both in San Rafael Val
ley and at Canyada Verde, just below the
line. These points are over 100 miles
apart. Dunham was at San Rafael three
weeks ago, they said, living in a little
cabin on tbe side of the mountain, north
of Real de Castillo.
He left there and went north and they
met him. He talked with them and told
them he was prospecting. He kept on
north and they followed him as far as
Canyada Verde. One nieht less tlian ten
days ago they saw him go to the bee ranch
owned by bis brother and himself.
They do not know whether he met any
body there or not. They kept track of
him and found that he was hiding in
Canyada Verde, an ideal robber's Te
treat, covered by dense underbrush, with
plenty of water and broken hills and
small canyons.
While Sheriff Lyndon's information is
not known it is believed it is something
on the same lines, and that he has secured
the services of some person who knows
Dunham intimately. On a former visit to
Texas in pursuit of Dunham Lyndon
took a man along who knew the mur
derer, in order to identify him.
The officers, so far as known, do not
know Dunham well enough to engage in
combat with the suspect, and possibly kill
an innocent man. They will undoubtedly
inck up the two Mexicans, who have not
been seen in this city. They may perhaps
b? waiting to meet Lyndon and Gard at
Tia Juana.
Tbe scene of tbe supposed hiding-place
of Dunham is about forty miles almost
due east. There is every likelihood of
news being received from tbe pursuing
party within twenty-four hours from per-
sons who will see them on the line.
REVIVED AT HIS GRAVE.
Narrow Escape of a Well-to-do Mexican
from Inhumation While in
a Trance.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 14.â Mexican
advices tell of a strange occurrence in the
interior last week w>ich resulted in tnrow
ing an entire community into a fever of
excitement and superstitious dread. Ga
briel Amador, a well-to-do man, was
taken seriously ill, and after hovering be
tween life and death for a week died. His
family, after the Mexican custom, kept
candles at his head and feet that night
and held a sort of modified "wake" over
tbe body, placing eatables and warm
drinks where guests dropping in during
tbe night could get them handily. The
funeral was veld witbin twenty-four hours
of the death, as required by law, and there
was an immense procession.
After the mass and other services the
procession reached the graveyard, all
walking on foot. Stout pallbearers car
ried the coffin, led by only the aexton and
finest. The sexton and one or two of the
pallbearers heard peculiar noises on the
way to the grave, but attributed them to
somebody in another burial party a short
distance away.
The coffin was deposited by the grave
side and the mourners gathered around
it, when a noise louder than usual
directed the attention of all to the coffin.
In a few moments there was a sort of
groan, followed by a commotion inside
the coffin. The lid was broken open by a
frantic Sick and tbe supposed corpse,
with staring eyes and pale face arose to
view. He was dazed and did not see
the crowd, but seemed to be in horrible
fear. He shrieked and sprang out of the
coffin and ran away, leaving the burial
party gasping with excitement and hor
ror.
Later the man was found in the suburbs,
attired in bis funeral garmenis and wan
dering aimlessly around. He bad bad an
epileptic fit of unusuai severity, and nis
reason was slow in returning. He was
taken home and cared for, and is now all
right.
The superstitious members of tbe family
assign Lis miraculous escape from a living
burial to direct intervention of divine
providence.
STOCKTON BURGLARS CAUGHT.
Two Brothers Arrested With Goods Stolen
From a Pawnshop in Their Pos
session.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dae 14.â The burg
lars who made such a bold haul from H.
Jacob's pawnshop here yesterday morn
ing were captured this afternoon near
Lathrop by Constable Atwood of that
place and are now in jail here. Atwood
had gone over to Durhams Ferry to serve
some legal papers and was on his way
home when he saw two men sitting by the
roadside. He recognized them as the
pair wanted for the burglary by the over
coat one of them had purloined from the
Hunter-street store. He went to John
Woli's place to <:et Wolf to aid him in
making the arrest. Wolf went with him
and the men were overhauled. All of the
stolen property was found in their pos
session, and Atwood placed them under
arrest.
One of them refused to go with Atwood
and broke into a run. The other Atwood
tied to his carriage with a piece of rope,
and then he and Wolf started in pursuit
of the runaway, leaving the man tied to
the wagon in the custody of Edward
Wolf. Atwood had. a carriage and Wolf a
carl and after a mile's hard drive through
the fields they overtook the fleeing burg
lar. He at once showed fight and drew a
razor, daring Atwood to arrest him.
The constable tried to reason with him,
but finally drew his revolver and fired at
the burglar, aiming at the weeds near his
feet. At this the man concluded to give
himself up and went back with the con
stable and Wolf.
The men gave their names as Frank
and Charles Harris. They claim to be
brothers, but further than" this will say
nothing.
SAN JOAQUIN REFORMERS.
Favor Abolisliinn the State Agricultural
Sir.iet:/.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 14.â The di
rectors of the Sau Joaquin Valley Agri
cultural Association this afternoon re
elected Frank D. Cobb president and C. E.
Doane secretary. The following resolu
tion, introduced by Director John Budd,
was adopted:
Resolved, That the Agricultural Association
of San Jouquln County favors the abolition of
the present system of atrricultnral societies in
this State and favors the formation of five
agricultural associations, located in different
portions of the State, under proper legislative
appropriation for their support, in lieu of the
present system.
This resolution contemplates doing
away with the State Agricultural Society
and dividing among the five associations
the $25,000 now given it annually.
San Jtiafa-l Suit Decided.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Dec. 14.â Judge
Angelotti to-day decided the case of Wil
liam Warker vs. the Nortu Pacific Coast
Railroad Company, an action to enjoin
the defendant from constructing a dam
across San Anselmo Creek, thereby appro
priating its water for railroad uses and
depriving the plaintiff of its use upon bis
land. Judge Angelotti decided in favor
of the plaintiff, but in such a way as to
allow defendant to dam the creek suffici
ently to secure use of the water, but not to
prevent its flow through the lands of de
fendant. The dam is not prohibited, but
it must not entirely obstruct the water.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec 14.â The
battle royal between those in charge of
the conflicting interests respecting the
selection of a deep-sea harbor for South
ern California and the expenditure of
$3,000,000 of money thereon is about to
open in this city. Some of tbe leaders ot

advance the interests of the two sites-
San Pedro and Santa Monicaâ from which
tne selection will be made. An immense
budget of statistical matter, including re
ports of Government engineers, sworn tes

favorable to San Pedro, carefully and deh
cataly worded so as not to offend or shock
the commissioners, are ready for submis

To tbe surprise of the peoDle generally
it is said that tbe commission intends to
open the whole case and spend many
weary days, if need be, in patiently hear
ing all tbe pros and cons which tbe ad
herents of both side? deÂ«ire submitted.
Everybody understands that tbis is to
be the final, the decisive battle. The com
mission is the court of last resort in the
premises; there will be no appeal from its
findings. Tbe great corporation interests
involved will lend zest and vigor to the
right. San Pedro from tbe first has been
championed by the Los Angeles Terminal
Railway Company, ably seconded by all
the commercial bodies of Southern Cali
fornia and nearly all the wholesale, retail
and manufacturing interests of this city.
Ouposed to this iormidable array is the
Southern Pacific Railroad, the beautiful
and thrifty town of Santa Monica and
many other private and speculative in
terests.
J. T. Kerns of St. Louis, Mo., several
times a millionaire, will head the forces in
favor of Kan Pedro, owing to his interest
in tbe terminal railway. Kerns is not
only a millionaire but a sagacious and ex
jenence'l diplomat and worker. As a
wireworker he can give cards aim spades
to "O;d Col'is."
Colonel Morgan of the commission is
already here. The other members, con
sisting of Admiral Walker and Engineers
Burr and Morrison, are due Wednesday.
Admiral Walker is, however, expected to
morrow afternoon. He came West over
the Northern Pacific, and has tarried at
Portland, Or., and at San Francisco. Sec
retary Pratt, who will be the disbursing
officer of the board, is in town.

Struck by a Train.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 14.â Albert
Roe, 18 years old, who recently arrived
from San Francisco, was strucK by a
Southern Pacific passenger train tbis after

jured and may die.
ASTORIA FISHERMEN'S PERIL.
Rescued After Clinging to the Sido of a
Capsized Boat for Nearly Twenty-
Four Hours.
ASTORIA. Ok., Dec. 14.â Two fisher
men, Andrew Simonsen and C. Christian
sen, who were picked up by a hunter yes
terday afternoon on Cathlaruet Bay, had a
most remarkable escape from death.
Shortly before dark on Saturday they
were returning from a fishing trip up the
r;ver and when off Tongue Point their
boat capsized. Both were strong swim
mers, but, being hampered by heavy
clothing and gum boots, and the current
being strong, they deemed it best to cling
to the upturned boat. Darkness set in
without tue arrival of help, and when the
river steamer to Portland passed the cries
of the men were unheard.
They were soon in such condition from
coid as to render it impossible to hold to
the boat much longer. Fortunately one
of them had in his pocket a strong cord,
with which he securely lashed himself and
his companion io the boat, and in this
position they drifted past the city and
toward the bar. The tide turning before
they reached the bar, the bost drifted up
the river again and atdaybreak on Sunday
they were near the srene of the disaster.
The boat was finally carried into Cath
lamet Bay, where it was seen by a hunter
during the afternoon and the men were
rescued. They were unconscious, but soon
recovered after being taken to their
homes.
WOULD EXEMPT HOMESTEADS.
Washington" -[Go vernor- Elect Urges a
Jieform in the lax tiyntrtn.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 14.â 1n a pam
phlet entitled "Fiee Land," issued by
Governor-elect Rogers and sent to every
member of the new Legislature, he takes
the position that free land is an "alien
able, imprescriptible and indestructible"
right of men, and draws lessons from the
ireedom and enjoyment of the Puyallup
Reservation Indians, which be thinks re
sults from their free, inalienable and un
taxable homesteads.
He proposes to the Legislature an
amendment providing that real estate and
all usual improvement to a value of not to
exceed $2500, occupied as a homestead by
any private family the head of which, is a
citizen of the United States and this
State, shall forever be exempted from tax
ation of every kind. The amount ex
cepted by this scheme would not exceed
10 per cent of the valuation, and such a
law would prevent that fatal clash of the
classes otherwise inevitable.

FRESNO COUNTY MYSTERY.
Miss Henrietta Jose Sudden// Disappears
Frtm the Car/y/e Ranch Near-
Jameson.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 14.â The authori
ties are puzzled over the mysterious dis
appearance of a girl named Henrietta
Jose from the ranch of George Carlyle, six
miles west of Jameson in the western
portion of the county, where she had been
employed as a domestic. She left the
house some time during Saturday night,
and no trace can be found of her. She did
not get up at the usual time on Sunday
morning, and when Mr?. Carlyle called
there was no response. Mrs. Carlyle then
entered the room of Miss Jose, but the
girl was not there. Nothing about the
room had been disturbed, and the domes
tic bad gone dressed in her everyday
clothing.
The more the case is investigated the
more mysterious it becomes. The girl
was of a happy disposition, and it is be
lieved that she did not commit suicide.
She always appeared well satisfied with
her place and would have no reason to
leave the Carlyle family in the night, or in
any strange manner. No motive can be
ascribed ior her leaving, if it was volun
tary.
A laborer named Joe Nestel has been
employed at the Cariyle ranch for some
time, and it is known that he was trying
to pay attentions to the young lady. She
scorned him, however, but tbis did not
seem to dampen his ardor. He persisted
in his attentions, but they were never re
ceived in other than in a very cold man
ner. Miss Jose was engaged to a young
man named Fred Weare, who lives at
Berenda, in Madera County.
Grim hints are being thrown out re
garding the fact that the Carlyle house
lies in the swamp district and that the
body of the girl might be found at the bot
tom of one of the numerous deep streams
that run through the wilderness of tules.
Considering all tne circumstances,' the
authorities are led to the belief that the
girl has been foully dealt with, by whom
they do not know.
PORTLAND'S PHENOMENON.
Mrs. Albertson Said io Possess a Vision
That Penetrates Op.que Sub
stances.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 14.â Mrs. Mary
S. Albertson, who twice last summercame
near buried aiive while in a trance, re
turned from Grants Pass five weeks ago
and is now in seclusion in a Lome in Port
land Heights. The only person she com
municates with is Mrs. Minna Stuttgren,
who knew her in Denmark. Mrs. Stutt
gren is a highly educated and intelligent
woman, about 35 years of age, and with a
mind so practical that it will not admit of
a belief in what the world commonly ac
cepts as miracles; but "he asseverates that
Mrs. Aibertsou, since her complete recov
ery of health, has been endowed with a
hitherto unknown gift, which some may
regard as supernatural.
Mm. Stuttgren says that Mrs. Albert
son's vision has become so piercing that it
can penetrate a solid substance â in fact, it
is more potent than the X ray. This phe
nomenal young woman is enabled without
scientific auxiliary means, she declares,
to observe the operations of all organs in
the human body as distinctly as if the hu
man frame were made of thin glass.
CARSON'S FIREBUG CAUGHT.
Detective Arrests a Boy About to Apply
a Match to the High School
Building.
CARSON, Nev., Dec. 14.â Walter Ker
meon, a boy about 14 years old, was
caught this morning at 5 o'clock in the
act of setting the public school building
on fire. J. 8. Ullrick, a local detective,
made the capture. This was the fifth at
tempt in the last month and a half to fire
the schoolhouse. Ullrick has been watch
ing the building for some time. About
three weeks ago some one attempted to
enter the building by one of the windows,
but the window was locked and he got out
of sight before he wa* recognized. After
that the window was left open and a sort
of trap ket which would make a noise in
case any one attempted to enter.
At 2 o'clock this morning the trap was
sprung, but the person again got away.
At 5 o'clock he tried again and entered
the room, carrying a sack of kindling and
a bottle of Kerosene. He immediately
started to kindle a fire, but was arrested
before the match was applied.
Kenneon was bareheaded and barefooted
when arrested. It is thought he has a
mania for starting fires. He was placed
under $5000 bonds to-day and will have
his preliminary examination to-morrow.
His father is very well-to-do, being su
perintendent of the Dunderburg mine,
one of the largest in this section.
Fresno County l.osrx a Suit.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 14â The suit of
Smilie Brothers, the Berkeley contractors
and builoers, against Fresno County for
$6708 62 was decided in favor of the plain
tiffs by Judce Webb to-day. In 1893 this
firm built two wings to the courthouse,
the contract price being $99,000. The
Board of Supervisors afterward ordered
additions and alterations costing the
amount for which the judgment was
given to-day. The county contended that
the alterations came under the provisions
of the contract and did not add anything
to the cost.

FIND TWO GREAT
MASTODON TUSKS
Valuable Fossils Unearthed
in a Gully Near
Stanford.
University Men Rewarded While
Searching for Geological
Specimens.
Rel!cs of a Prehistoric Age to Be
Added to the Palo Alto
Museum.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., Dec.
14. â During tbe latter part of last week a
pair of fossil mastodon tusJts were found
by Dr. Branner and G. B. Wilson. News
of the discovery was given out to-day by
Mr. Wilson. They were on a collecting
trip among the hills southwest of the
university. While digging in the gravel
in a narrow gully for fossil shells, part of
one of the tusks was uncovered. Its mate
was found shortly afterward.
Owing to the character of the soil the
giant tusks were well preserved. As it
would take about four men to carry one of
them from their present site to the uni
versity, they were carefully covered and
observations taken to determine their
location. A party of students will bring
tbe fossils to the university during the
Christmas holidays.
Dr. Branner made light of the discovery.
He said that it was of no infrequent oc
currence to find remains of either ele
phants or mastodons in this region. In
rummaging through a lot of dusty fossils
in search of an elephant's tooth he pointed
out a weather-worn human skull which
had been pierced by a bullet. When asked
where it was picked up, he replied that be
had found it in Mayfieid on one of his
geological trips. Tbe elephant's tooth and
many other interesting fossils found in
tbe neighborhood are kept in tbe geo-
logical department.
MEETING OF LEGISLATORS-ELECT.
Lawmakers South of iha Tehachapi Con-
sider Piopcsitions From Their
Constituents.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 14.- A volu
ble and imposing array of individuals,
with sundry interests at heart, met their
"servants" â members-elect of the Cali
fornia Legislature â at the Chamber of
Commerce rooms here this afternoon.
They did not mince matters one bit when
addressing the lawmakers regarding
changes, repeals or new enactments which
they wanted attended to at the approach
ing session of the Legislature.
Secretary Willard of the chamber led
eff modestly by informing the members
t at $10,000 would be necessary to make a
decent, exhibit of California products at
the Nashville Exposition next year. To
make anything like a creditable showing
at the trans-Mississippi Exposition at
Omaha, every cent of $75,000 would be re
quired This show woult, take place in
1899. Then there was the International
Exposition in 1900 at Paris. For Califor
nia to iirnore Ler opportunities there
would be suicidal, so $150,000 would be re
quired. It t is plan was readily agreed to
$20,000 was necessary at once for pre
liminary work.
Then President Field of the Los An
geles Supervisors read a set of resolutions,
which, he explained, had been adopted at
a late conference of Southerns California
boards of supervisors; but in answer to
questions put to the reader it was learned
that only three counties were represented,
instead of seven, when ti.e resolutions had
been adopted. These resolutions want the
State Bureau of Highways abolished, the
semi-annual plan of tax-paying changed
to annual and the privileges of supervisors
vastly extended.
Field was followed by represents yes of
the Los Angeles Wheelmen, the Dairy
men's As ociation, Women's Christian
Temperance Union, fruit-shippers, the
orphan asylums, the insane asylum at
Highlands, the Wiiiitier Reform School
and others.
An evening newspaper has discovered
that the delegates at this conference "will
stand pretty well together for Hon. Frank
Coombs of Napa for Speaker of the House
and Hon. Brewster C. Kenyon of this
county for Speaker pro tern It ia also
understood that Hon. L. H. Valentine
will be chosen as chairman of the Los
Angeles County delegation in the lower
House."
IN JUSTICE TO DAIRYMEN.
Secretary Tanderbilt on the Slaughter of
Tuberculous Vows.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec 14.â William
Vanderbiit, secretary of the State Dairy
Bureau, at a meeting of the local dairy
men at the Chamber of Commerce to-day,
said :
"Outside of interested classes the enor
mous increase of the dairying interests in
this State is little known. It will be a sur
prise to many to know that we have in
creased plants and capital and methods
until we stand among leading States of
the Union with reeard to our dairying
outnut. The bill limiting the manufacture
and restricting the sale of oleomargarine
has made the sale of the stuff so difficult
that hardly any is now sold within the
State. We desire to yet luore restrict it,
however, and 1^ am now sounding senti
ment upon two or three measures which it
is proposed to introduce at the next ses
sion of the Legislature.
"As to the recent sensations about tuber
culous cows which were started in San
Francisco, I think it is the nucleus of a
scheme by which several men expect to
'work 1 the State to create new positions
and then work themselves into them.
This measure by which it is proposed to
slaughter all the cows so diseased might
result in the slaughter of a great many
animals, and insomuch as it matters not
if a cow is slightly tainted, so long as it
does not affect the milk-producing organs,
and insomuch as it does not hurt the milk
if the latter is the case, it might result in
sreat injustice."
San J.uis Ohispo Blaze.
B AN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Dec. 14.-The
two-story dwelling and saloon of Peter
Edgar, situated a few miles west of this
city, was burned to the ground last night.
The loss was $1500. The fire is supposed

Stockton Grants a Franchise.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 14.â The City
Council to-night passed an ordinance
granting to the Corral Hollow road the
right to lay two tracks on Weber avenue,
near the bunker site. There is now no
obstacle in the way of the road going

pleting the bunkers.
The management was waiting for the
franchise only before finishing the work.
Director Jonn Treadwell said that coal
would ba ready for delivery here on
Christmas day if the ordinance passed. It
was at once signed by Mayor Baggs on
being passed by tne Council.
Arbuekle Murderer Sentenced.
COLUSA, Cal., Dec. 14.â Judge E. A.

; BOSTON, 'i, Mass., Dec. 14.â When the
Lilliputians, who played at the Tremont
Theater last week in The "Merry Tramps,"
departed for Hartford yesterday afternoon
they left three of their number locked up
in the Charles-street i jail. ; They .had been
arrested Saturday afternoon by officers of
the Sheriff and held to answer to a suit
for damaces instituted by Adolph Phillips,
the New York playwright. .ââââ-.
â  Phillips sued for the sum of $38,000, de
claring that two years ago the three little
folks had signed- a six montns' contract
with him to play under : his direction.
According to his claim they did not keep
their contract, bence the r suit. Because
Manager Carl Rosenfeld â  of .-' the (Lillipu
tians could, not put up :SBS, OOO worth of
security and because the- little folKs were
themselves powerless to furnish the neces
sary security, they bad to go to jail. ,
" How could I get that much security,
in Boston rat a day's f notice?" said Mr.
Rosenfeld. - "I don't know a single man
in Boston that i I could go to for aid.
Neither could I in New York at such short
notice. ; There is no help for me this Bide
of Germany. I have cabled for $10,000.
It will be here'to-dav. Perhaps we can fix
the thing all right then." :
The prisoners are Frank Ebert, Adolph
Zink and Max Walter. .

the "glad band" out for everybody to
day and will keep it extended during the
remainder of the week. Her flags are at
the top of the staffs and flying a welcome
lo the whole State,
To-day the San Joaquin Valley Citrus
Fair opened here. It Is really the first
affair of the kind that can be rightfully
dignified with the nameof fair. Last win
ter â though it would be more proper to
call that season here by some other name,
some name that carries with it the aroma
of oranges and orange blossoms, fruits and
"flowersâ they had a little exhibit here in
Armory Hall of citrus fruits just for a
starter. It was exclusively a Fresno
County affair. No other county was in it.
This year they Â»rÂ« nearly all in it and
doing themselves proud. Fresno decided
to make it a San Joaquin Valley event,
and a noteworthy one at that. She has suc
ceeded. The citrus fair is held with the
purpose of benefitting every county in
the valley, though King and Kern
counties have not as yet sent in exhibits.
The San Joaquin Valley wants to show
the shippers of California and the people
of the whole earth that she can raise just
as good oranges and lemons as Southern
California, which they say has been
looked upon as the place of supply for
such fruit, but shall be looked unon so no
more. Fresno and the valley counties
got up this fair to show that oranges, as
one instance, ripen and are ready for
marKet from six weeks to one month
earlier than they do south of Tehachapi
and that they are just as fine oraugesas
are warmed by the sun and wet by the
dew in any clime.
Another object of the fair is to promote
-a spirit of unity and co-operation among
the counties of the valley. As an illustra
tion of the profitable effect of such har
mony and unity they point to the united
counties and fruit interests of the south
ern portion of the State.
â¢ The weather was fine. A more brilliant
or more invigorating day for the opening
of a fair could not have been made to or
der. Nature smiled not only on the
fields, the vineyards and the orchards of
the broad San Joaquin, but upon her prin
cipal event also.
â  'A large pavilion was especially erected
for the occasion. It is on I street, between
Kern ana Tulare, is 160x140 feet in dimen
sions, and ft a s 22,400 feet oi floor space.
Over the main entrance on I street, ex
tending nearly across the front of the
building, is the announcement in large
block letters, "Erected for the Ban Joa
>quin Valley Citrus Fair."
Along the cornice of the front is a lone
stretch of red, white and blue, while
above, on staffs, floats Old Glory in num
erpus array, the row being dotted here
and there by pennants of green and yel
low, the colors of the fair â green for the
leaf and yellow for the orange. Palms
which grow so luxuriously in this section
are tacked in graceful arrangement alone
the front and side of the pavilion.
But it is on the inside of the pavilion
that the decorations and the ornaments
and th* vast array of fruits the more ex
cites the admiration of the visitor. There,
amid the odor of oranges and flowers, pre
served fruits and palms and in a brilliant
glow of electric light the opening exer
cises took plac* to-night
Justy's band of tbireen pieces supplies
the music for the fair. The committee on
* arrangements is hugging itself with de
'â¢ light over Justy's statement that he has
secured several soloists once members of
Sougn's band to ; tickle the tympanums
and elevate the souls of the citrus-admir
ing crowds during the week.
The opening piece to-night was the
march "Citrus ; Fair," ' composed by W.
Scott Haygood. The Apollo Club, a vocal
organization, will also be among the
musical attractions of the. week. The
committee intended to have some literary
exercises, too, but found that the sound
waves from the' average amateur voice
would - hardly extend from the band
stand beyond the second row of posts. (
A good-sized Â» audience attended the
opening night, fuily as many ladies as
gentlemen being present. . Judge Stanton
L. Carter of Fresno consented to deliver
the opening address. - He spoke from the
band-stand, which is the hub of the
pavilion,* which all the displays confront.
Â£Â L. Bern bard . officiated as master of
ceremonies. He made a few introductory
remarks, in. wbdeh he briefly reviewed the
efforts of the committees to make the fair
a success and expressed the hope that this
exposition was a starting: point for others
of the future, i . " '.
Then; Judge Carter was introduced.
After extending a welcome to the citizens
*of the San Joaquin Valley, visitors and
friends; the Judge said:
â¢ "No - passport is â¢ needed -to traverse
Fresno's streets and }no walls encompass
her borders, but every road and avenue is
open and unobstructed for all to come and
goat will.''L -.; . :; I- â ' \- :.-
He said the fair was designed not alone
to show the progress made in this county,
but in the entire San Joaqnin Valley as
well especially in the production of citrus
fruits; ' to show the x possibilities, which for
so many years had lain dormant and un
recognized: to' stimulate and encourage
the expansion of these productions, which
were destined to add untold millions to
our wealth; to cultivate a spirit of friendly
rivalry among citizens of the various ; sec
tons adapted t6 their successful growth.
"That their production is no longer an
experiment, io , : proven by > the ? golden
splendors which now surround us, ; he
said. That this â  valley > can successfully
compete with the far-famed southland of
this State has already I been demonstrated,
and it but remains for our people to avail
themselves of this plenteous, source of
r wealth i which nature's generous bounty
has placed so easily, within their reach to
become one of the leading counties in the
production of : these fruits. We are proud
of this fair city and the marvelous results
her citizens- have r . accomplished in a few
short years. : We believe . that Â§no : more
favored spot can be found ,â¢; in this grf at
State.' We believe we can truly say of our
fair city, in the -language of one of Cali
fornia's . : poets, whose â¢! brilliant son is an
honored resident 'of : our city: â ;_ â '.
Where then HEdan? Ah, why should I tell. â -
What every eye and bo-tom know so well? V'
Why name the land all other, lands have blest,
And traced forages 10 the distant West?
' Why search in vain throughout the historic pace,
For Eden's garden and the golden AgtT â¢-'
Here, brother, here, no further let us roam, *. .

Progressive Men "Whose Labors Have Helped to Make the San Joaquin Valley Gtrus Fair a Success
"But we are not unmindful of the acÂ£
vantages of our sister cities or of the other
splendid counties which with ours com
prise the principality embraced within it.
We know that you have the same pride in
your own homes that we possess in ours.
It is a pardonable and proper spirit. Few,
if any of the boundless resources of the
State, or of the soil, are lacking in this
valley or even in this county. The giant
redwood forests of Humboldt and Marin,
of San Mateo and Santa Cruz are pygmies
beside Jthe groves of sequoia eigante
within our borders and the millions of
feet of redwood, spruce and sugar pir.e cut
annually in our mountains, find a market
throughout ail the western States and
Territories. Our herds of cattle, our
droves of horses and flocks of sheep are
surpassed nowhere in the State ana in the
production of pork and poultry, of butter
and eggs, our possibilities are lim
ited only by the demand. Los
Angeles or Ventura cannot, surpass
us in petroleum products; natural gas la
found here in abundance, and our asphal
tum beds, though not so extensive ss those
of San Luis Obispo and 6anta Barbara, are
not behind them in quality. Deposits of
chalk and limestone, with abundant luel,
await only the impetus of demand to
enable us to rival Santa Cruz and San Ber
nardino in the production of lime. Vast
mountains of gyp-urn and great beds of
asbestos will some day add greatly to our
wealth, and while our coal deposits are in
ferior to those of Contra Costa, they excel
the coal of Amador. The Sierras,*wnich
wall our eastern border, possess iheir
share of the precious metals â of the iron,
copper and other mineral products
which seam the mountains of this
State from Siskiyou to San Diego.
The grainfields of Butte and Colusa,
robed in golden garments like a royal
bride, have their counterparts here. Corn
can be produced in abundance, and no
where else does alfalfa flourish as luxuri
antly or reward ho bounteously the hus
bandman. The sugar beet can be grown
here with less expense and is richer in
saccharine products than at Cbiuo or
Watsonville. No longer may RÂ»dlands
and Riverside, Lo? Angeles and Han Diego
claim a monopoly of the production of
citrus fruits. Our prunes rival the fam
ous products ot Santit Clara. The valleys
of Napa, Sonoma and Livermore no longer
hold the palm for the production of wines
and brandies. Our olive groves will soon
equal those of Santa Barbara, and for rai
sins and dried fruits we have no rival.
The vine and tig flourish here as nowhere
else. Our mountains and foothills pro
duce apples equal to thoÂ«e of Santa Cruz
and San Mateo, of El D >rado and Tuol
umne, and in our valleys the peach and
the apricot, the pear and nectarine, the
pommegranate and almond flourish be
yond comparison, and even the banana
has been grown and ripened within our
city. All berries and vegetable products
yield amazing returns.
"Again and on behalf of our citizens, I
bid you thrice welcome to our midst."
Judge Carter's address was heartily ap
plauded. Colonel H. G. Shaw of Stock
ton, representing San Joaquin Valley and
the StocJcton Commercial Association's
exhibit, delivered an extern poraneouii re
sponse on behalf of the other counties of
the valley represented at the fair. Cuionel
Shaw said he knew they were welcome
before Judge Carter said so.
"We could read a kind welcome in the
cheerful Fresno eye and the warm shake
of the hand," he said. '-Though I was
notified only a short time ago that I was
to reply to the address of wecome, it re
quires no preparation to make a response.
The heart is always ready to make a reply
on such an occasion as this. We are with
you and all the counties of the vailev in
the spirit of this fair. We are proud and
glad to see you take this leadership. What
we need in Central California is to stand
together. We have a State that needs
only the hand and the genius of th ehu
man race to rvstor* the garden of Eden. ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1896.
Our rivers that have their sources in the '
mountains have waited for centuries
for man to harness them and to
develop that water power which we sea so
brilliantly consummated here to-nigtit in
these electric lights. We can close g*tt
eyes and dream just a little and see wiiat
rich work there is for man to do in the
San Joaaiin Va ley.
"We have heard of your Hundred-
Thousand Club," continued Colonel Shaw.
"At first we did not know up in Stockton
what it meant. It ought to be called the
Two Hundred Thousand Ciub, for I have
met ten men on your committee who are
worth 10,000 men each, and there you
have 100,000 to start with already. You
have more spirit and energy and are
quicker to realize your opportunities than
our people of Stockton. If we had your
spirit we would be a city of 300,000 popu
lation now.
"But we are doing good and we are with
you. It will take a whole block to hold
the next citrus show in Fresno. We shall
join you in your schemes to benefit the
valley. We believe the time will come
when there will be two, and may be three
great cities in this valley, an l that Fresno
and Stockton will be neck and neck,
though they are not rivals in any sense.
They are too far apart.
"Some day," the colonel said, in conclu
sion, "we will invite you up to Stockton
to see the greatest citrus exhibition you,
ever saw. We have brought our oranges
and laid them beside yours. We may not
be now so strong on oranges as we could
be, hut I think we can raise as good
oranges as you can. Stockton is a great
manufacturing city â the second in the
State; the first in the State outside of San
Francisco. We are the only manufac
turers of art pottery in the United States,
except for one factory which is in Cincin
nati."
The colonel complimented Tulare
County on its splendid exhibit, and ap
proved of the cultivation of that kind of
rivahy between tite counties of the valley
which would do them each and all good.
His speech wasenthustastically applauded.
After the speech-making the crowd
wandered down the many aisles among
the splendid exhibits. The green and
yellow colors of the fair are everywhere in
the pavilion. They hang in sweeping
curves of cloth Irom rafter to rafter. The
many rows of posts are green, entwiued
with orange yellow. At the intersection
of the aislbs are potted palms and trees,
branches of dates tacked to the corners.
There are pyramids of oranges and lemons
and wines in bottles almost as tall as the
cross above the top of Lone Mountain.
There are piles of apples which rise above
the surrounding displays of dried fruit as
conspicuously as the Twin Peaks do above
the surrounding country.
Not to be outdone by the fruit which ia
nocently brought sin into the world* in
that other Garden of Eden on the Med
iterranean, the oranges have formed them
selves into small mountains also. Lem
ons form a bordering of lighter yellow to
the rich orange colors and lettering.
A finer lot of dried fruit has not been
seen anywhere since dried frmt was dis
covered. There are square yards of it all
over the pavilionâ tigs, raisins, plums,
prunes and everything in that line. The
jellies in the many racks are rich and
clear and tempting. Their covers of thin
tissue paper hardly protect them from
the multitude, but this sien, which is on
every exhibit, keeps the crowd off : "Please
do not handle the fruits."
The display of cereals is fine. Fresno
County, as a county, makes no exhibit,
lor the reason that she does not want to
be a competitor for the many cash
premiums and diplomas which she offers
to exbiblton. The Chamber of Commerce
of Fresno, however, makes a complete
and very handsome exhibit of all the
products of the county.
Visitors began to come in on this after
noon's train. The fair will continue
through next Saturday and longer if }he
interest warrants it. Round-trip excur
sion rates of one and one-third have Deen
secured to the fair from all points between
San FrÂ»ncisco and Los Angeles inclusive.
All exespt one or two exhibits are in
place. Tulare County has the largest ex
hibit at the fair. It comprises everything
in the fruit line, dried anl fresh, tl.at can
be shown at this time of the year. Stanis
laus aud San Joaquin counties also have
very extensive and attractive exhibits of
thesame an ! Fresno has a novelty in the
way of peanuts on the vine.
Among the exhibitors who have secured
space are the following:
Fresno â St. George Vineyard, oranges,
lemons and wines; Fresno Home Packing
Company, fancy raisins and dried fruits;
Eagle Packing and Storage Company, dried

From the formal opening of the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road on October 5, and the memorable,
prophetic speech made that night by
Claus Spreckels from the balcony of the
Hughes Hotel, the commercial arteries of
Fresno seem to have taken in new blood,
and the Hundred Thousand Club and
Chamber of Commerce to have freshened
their enthusiasm with new ardor.
Mr. Spreckels predicted that with co-op
eration and a proper business enterprise
there was no reason why Fresno should
not have a population of 100,000 in a few
years and become the metropolis of the
San Joaquin Valley. A short time after
the opening of the Valley road the sub
ject of having a winter citrus fair, to in
clude the entire valley, was broached by
some one, and from this little acorn of an
idea has grown the splendid exhibition
that is not only an honor to the city in
which it is to be seen, but a tribute to the
wonderful fertility of the great San
Joaqnin Valley.
Committees of the Chamber of Com
merce and the Hundred Thousand Club
took the matter in band. The other coun
ties of the valleyâ Kern, Kin<j, Tulare,
Stanislaus, Merced an i San Joaquin â were
invited to participate. This was only
about six weeks ago. when the work of get
ting up the fair really began. All the coun
ties co-operated except Kern and King,
which are not represented. Merced and
Stockton are among the localities which
have the most attractive exhibits.
The people of Fresno entered into the
project with enthusiasm. The general
committee on the citrus fair Tound that
not less than $6000 would be needed to
make it a success. They went to the busi
ness men and people and a guarantee fund
ot $5000 was raised. List Saturday even
ing members of the Hundred Thousand
Club took off their coats, went into the
pavilion, and helped to arrange the ex
hibits'. All freight on exhibits is paid by
the management.
Following is a list of the general coin
mitteemen of the fair: Chairman. F. K.
Prescott; viue-cnaiiman, H. Qundeifiager;
treasurer, J. McMuliin; secretary, Mark
Webster; assistant secretary, W. B. Den
nett; F. M. Chittenden, E. F. Bernhard,
G. C. Roeding, J. C. Nourse, D. J. Gug
genheim, F. G. Berry, C. F. Wyer, C. fi.
Markham and S. W. Marshall.
These were divided also into sub-com
mittees on financ ', building and heating
and concessions, exriibits and decorations,
door management, advertising, premiums,
hotel accommodations, transportation and
programme.
STRANGE FIND NEAR UKIAH.
Discovery of a Skeleton Seated Astride a
Branch of a Tall Fir
Tree.
TLKIAH, Cal., Dec. 14.â Charles Ryan,
who lives on Pine Ridge, about ten miles
west of this city, to-day told a remarkable
story of the discovery of a human skele
ton. Early in the morning Ryan took his
shotgun and went out into the woods to
kill squirrels. He soon discovered a gray
squirrel, which ran up into the top of a
tall fir tree. Ryan tired at the little ani
mal, which fell from its perch, but did not
strike the ground. Ryan .was somewhat
puzzled at the failnre of the squirrel to
drop and examined the tree carefully,
thinking perhaps the little animal had
fallen and lodged in the branches. After
carefully scrutinizing the fir for some
minutes he discovered what appeared to
be a large nest, made apparently from the
dead branches of the trep, and on looking
more closely saw the bushy tail of the
squirrel hanging from the ne3t.
Ryan det- rinined to have the squirrel
at any cost, and nutting down his gun,
he took off his coat and prepared to as
cend the trunk of the fir. The squirrel
had lodged about sixty feet from the
ground, and it was with some difficuly
that that height was reached.
When he clambered onco the branch in
which the squirrel was lodged Ryan was
horrified to discover that the object he
had mistaken for a nest was the skeleton
of a human beng.
The skeleton was seated astride of a
branch of the tree, closs up to the trunk.
One of th 9 legs had fahen (tff, but other
wise the skeleton was in a fair state of
preservation. It was tightly lodged in the
tree and bore evidence of having been
there for many years.
Ryan secured his squirrel and de
scended. He did not dislodee the skel
eton, as be intends taking a rope and low
erintr it to the ground to prevent breaking
it. It is possiule th:s discovery clears the
mysterious disappearance of Andrew No
brick, a pioneer settler of Con Creek, who
was supposed to have left the country
about seventeen yearn ago. He left his
cabin one morning in the late seventies
nnd since that time has never been heard
of. It is thought by Mr. Ryan that the
skeleton is that of a man who was either
driven to the tree for refuge irom wiid
beasts, or who, after being lost in the
woods, ascended the tree for observation
and fell, lodging in the crotch of the tree.

SERVED TIME IN
ENSENADA'S JAIL
Manuel Riveroll Demands
Heavy Damages From
Mexico.
Imprisoned as a Suspect Atter
the Famous Gold-Bar
Theft.
His Innocence Established After He
Had Lost Friends and
Fortune.
LOS ANGELES, Ual., Dec. 14.â Manuel
Riveroll, one of the most prominent resi
dents of Lower California, haa returned
from a visit to the City of Mexico, where
he took steps to recover heavy damages
from tne Mexican Government for an im
prisonment of about two months in the
jail at Ensenada a year ago.
Riveroll was conducting a shipping
office and acted as agent for the Caimalli
Mining Company at Ensenada in March,
1895, when a gold bar was one night stolen
from the safe in the office of the Caimalli
mines. It was valued at $12,608, and al
though Riveroll's chief clerk, Alton Pratt,
was charged with the theft and placed in
jail with his friend, James E. Garratt, who
afterward turned out to be the real thief,
nothing could be proven against Pratt or
Garratt
Id apparent desperation, the authorities
arrested Riveroll and confined him in the
desolate jail. They refused bail in any
amount and in consequence of the impris
onment Riveroll's profitable shipping
business was ruined and the stigma which
attached to him caused his dismissal as
agent of various concerns, leaving him at
the end of two months a comparatively
poor man, although be was possessed of
considerable property at the b ginning of
the trouble.
His wife, who was sick at the time of
his ams: and imprisonment, naturally
grew worse, and in Deing removed to this
city for better medical treatment was the
victim of a ranaway accident resulting in
her death a short time afterward. River
oll was also subjected to much indignity
from residents of the Mexican town, who
had formerly been his friends, but who
publicly expressed the belief that he had
stolen the gold brick.
When, after two months' incarceration,
Rivercll was released, he was forced to
come to San Diego in order to make a liv
ing, pending a rearrangement of his busi
ness affairs. On occasions when he vis
ited Ensenada he was treated with disre
spect by Mexican officials and in various
ways was made to suffer much anguish.
After Garratt's release from the En
senada jail, Riveroll had a watch set upon
him wnh the result that Garratt was fol
lowed back to Ensenada and surprised
almost in the act of unearthing the gold
bar. Riveroll was at once restored to
popular favor, but the injustice that had
been done him and the financial losses he
had sustained were made the basis for the
step he lias taken to recover damages in a
heavy sum.
BANK ROBBi-lt CONFESSES.
Hau> the Tunnel Wa* texctrated Under
//Â»<â  first National.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 14.âSensa
tional testimony was given this afternoon
at the trial of J. J. McCarthy for tunnel
ine under tbe First National Bank. Fred
L. Jone9, charged with complicity, made
a full confession of all the details, swear
ing that McCarthy was one of the gang.
The other two robbers, according to Jones,
were Stevens and Campbell, and there
were two other men who did the work on
the tunnel. The men consumed two
months in running the tunnel under the
bank's vaults, but before they could blow
them open the plot was discovered and
Jones and McCarthy arrested. Jones -will
plead guilty when he is tried next week.

What the East yearns for and knows it
not is the California novelty.
The Senate has a sharp stick for Spain,
but apparently no sword for Cuba.

In a few more days you will hear the

It is better to shop during rainy weather
than to wait for sunshine and be caught
in the crush at the end.
If Ambrose Bierce doesn't look out "Long
Green" may detail him to act as bad-man
referee of the next prize-fight.
The people of the blizzard-blown East
will please take notice that our citrus fairs
have begun and travel is cheap.
Weyler seems to have returned to Ha

It is now reported that Barney iJarnato

there to be no end to that sort of thing?
The statesmen are by no means in favor
of an extra session if they can avoid it.
They know what Washington is in the
summer-time.
In preparing for the work of Christmas
charity don't overlook the Salvation
Army. It always carries help where help
is most needed.
Californians will fight for a Cabinet rep
resentative, but they will not fight over it.
There is a prospect of harmony in this as
in everything else just now.
Every lottery ticket sold in this City
is ju?t so much taken away from tne activ
ity of business, the comforts of the home
nd the joy of the Christmas season.
The Republican Senatorial committee
appointed to promote a return to bimetal
lism has begun its work, and the mone
tary cloud has once more a silver lining.
*There are increasing evidences that
Speaker Reed intends this to be something
more tban a routine session of Congress,
and when he intends anything it generally
happens.
If some of our contemporaries had not
advertised so many lottery swindles to
de'raud the people during the year they
would not have so much need to be calling
for charity now.
ft would not surprise anybody if "Long
Green" Lawrence should make the Ex

who put op Wyatt Earp as referee and
fixed the whole job.
Now that Grover has gone duck-hunting
again the State Department has an oppor

Their report shows they couldn't be left at
the start and they may be all right in the
end.
Tb9 report that the House will under
take to pass a tariff bill this winter should
awaken the attention of Californians. Our
great sugar industry needs protection, and
should be provided for in any measure of
the kind proposed.
As the Examiner has quit publishing the
opinions of the enemies it is proud of,
there is a possibility it may be preparing
to dump upon the public something from
the friends who are proud of it, thus giv
ing the slums another opening.
The Placer Argus is slightly in error in
saying that by holding the mirror up to
nature the people can "discern plainly
what a rotten concern the Examiner and
Journal combination is for a fact." The
combination is not for a fact, but for a fake.
Mr. O ilsen, secretary of the West Indies
committee in London, is quoted as having
said recently that the planters of the
British West Indies felt "they would be
better treated if absorbed by the United
States." This is another hint of manifost
destiny.
It is explained that the reason Reed did
not call on McKinley when he passed
through Canton was because the train
passed the place at 2 a. m., and Reed did
not know that Canton was on his route.
This explanation is undoubtedly sufficient
for the rest of the country, but it is rouuh
on Canton after all the advertising it bus
had as a railroad center.
THE "EXAMINER'S" OFFENDING.
Nearly every journal of weight and influence in California has given within
the past month expression to a feeling of abhorrence at the disgrace brought upon
the profession by the character of journalism exploited by Willie Hearst and his
managing editor, Long Green Lawrence, in the Examiner. These expressions in
the press have been cordially approved by the people. Indecent journalism has
reached its limit, and if the Examiner is to continue publication much longer it
will be at the sole expense of the Hearst estate, for it will not derive patronage suf
ficient to maintain it even from the slums to which it panders.
The reasons for this revolt on the part of decency against the Examiner and its
managers are many. The paper has committed every form of iniquity known to
lying, fraudulent and blackmailing journalism. It has repeatedly carried sensa
tionalism to the extent of indecency and has not infrequently made its indecency
obscene. It has bulldozed and blackmailed where it could; and where it could not,
it has slandered, maligned, libeled and belied. There is scarcely a section of the
State whose citizens and whose industries have not suffered more or less trom its
attacks and the repute of California abroad has been foully injured by it in al
most every publication.
When denounced by decent journals of the State it has had the shameless im
pudence to assert that they were hired to do so by the railroad. It has met every
exposure of its offenses either by an insolent swagger of shameless vice, or has
endeavored to turn them aside by claiming that its vicious' and malignant attacks
were intended merely for jokes and jests.
The people of California have borne with these offenses for a long time. In
fact they have borne them too long. By permittine such outrageous conduct to
be pursued without punishment and almost without rebuke they have encouraged
the evildoers in their iniquity and led them to believe they could commit with
impunity even the greatest offenses.
We have seen Mr. Hearst place in control of the Examiner a man so widely
reputed to bedisbonest that he is familiarly known as "Long Green." We have seen
the paper under the management of that man engaged in efforts to ruin business,
dishonor reputations, pollute the public, defile politics and degrade society. To
guard himself from outraged citizens we have seen that manager employ as a pro
tector a disreputable gun-figbter and in the boldness thus assured him continue
his evil work.
We have seen the Examiner exposed in extorting money from the Southern
Pacific Railroad and yet having the unabashed insolence to accuse innocent men
of the same offense. We have seen its managing editor not content with having a
bravo for his protector and literary as.-is.ant, procuring the appointment of that
bravo as referee in a prize-fight for the purpose of defrauding bettors and swindling
the public
We have seen the Examiner sending women to report prizefights, to wander at
night through the slums, to interview criminals and thugs, to hunt and seek for
sensations in places that reek with shame, indecency and obscenity, and then we
have seen that same journal turn round and denounce with an assumed virtue the
women who followed the example of its lady reporters and went on their own ac
count to watch a contest in the prize-ring.
We have seen the managers of the Examiner denounce all persons who
claimed to have seen the strange lights in the sky during the past month as
drunkards, imbeciles or liars and at the same time send to their companions of the
New York Journal a story declaring that an airship was seen by wit
nesses who are reputable, creditable, reliable and thoroughly honest. We have
seen the Examiner manager in this City recommend Wyatt Earp as an honorable
man, while the Examiner's proprietor in New York, through the Journal of that
city, denounced him as being utterly disreputable and capable of any kind of dis
honest dealing, from the running of a bunko game to the robbing of a stage-coach.
All this and more we have seen. It is not strange, therefore, that at last the
public revolts. Ac strong, straight Saxon speech in which the decent newspapers
of California are now denouncing this foul and unclean journalism is none too
forceful for the occasion. We have compromised with the evil too long. It is not
a pleasant duty to expose all this vilene.Â«s to the public, but in the interests of the
public it must be done. So long as the Hearst estate holds out and Willie Hearst
has not fulfilled the New York prediction of changing his residence to Sing Sing
and his name to No. 743 we may have the Examiner still circulating in the commu
nity. It should not, however, be permined to circulate in the homes of the
people or in places of decent business. Let it go to the alums, to which it pauders,
and from which all its ideas emanate.
THE LOTTERY EVIL.
Rev. William A. Gardner, pastor of the 1
West Side Christian Church, in preaching !
upon "The Lottery and Other Forms of
Gambling." took a most timely topic for
his subject- Not long ago a vigorous
crusade against the lottery swindlers
abated the evil in this City to a great ex
tent, but of late they have become bold
again, and once more considerable sums
of money are taken away from the busi
ness and from the homes of San Francisco
by their fraudulent and unlawful prac
tices.
Speculation in lottery tickets is the be^
ginning of a career in gambling which not
infrequently leads to the most disastrous
consequences. Chauncey Depew i* quoted ,
as saying that a very large percentage of
the moral failures among men with whom
he was acquainted has been due to
gambling. It is an evil which sooner or
later corrupts the mind as well as wrecks
the purse, and is the prolific source of
defalcations, forgeries and stealing.
One of the chief promoters of the lottery
evil is the press. There are too many
papers willing to sell their columns to
advertise lottery schemes, although the
proprietors well know that lottery com
panies are unlawful, and that nearly
every one of them is as gross a swindle as
ever was concocted by a bunko man or a
gold-brick swindler. This being so, Mr.
Gardner wns fully justified in saying:
'Tis a shame that our daily papers are aid
ing and abetting these nefarious institutions
by publisning their advertisements and carry-
ing them into the homes of our people and
thus acquainting our children with this crime
that is wrecking homes and ruining men and
women.
The Call has repeatedly directed pub
lic attention to the evil, and is thank
ful for the assistance which the pulpit has
given in the crusade against this insidious
form of vice. It is an offense of a nature
with which the police alone are unable to
deal. It is difficult for an officer of the
law to obtain evidence sufficient to con
vict the swindlers. If, therefore, the evil
is to be suppressed the people themselves
must take part in the contest against it.
Public indignation should condemn every
newspaper that publishes the enticements
of the swindlers, and good citizens should
be prompt and ready to givefo our munici
pal authorities and the officers of our
courts all the assistance they can in
catching, convicting and punishing the
rascals.
MONEY AND INDUSTRY.
Commenting upon the financial sitna
tion in that city the New \ork Herald
says: "At present we have a glut of idle
money. Rates of interest are lower here
than in Europe, and the bankers and capi
talists of the Old World are borrowing
from us." On this showing the Herald
exults, and declares with a display of local
pride: "Thus, for the first time New
York is formally recognized by la haute
finance of Europe as one of the great
money centers of the world."
In explanation of this condition of af
fairs the Herald goes on to say:
This enormous gain has come from Imports
ot gold, the output of the mines, the increase
oi National bank note circulation and the
treasury's expenditures in excess of what it
has collected. As a result of the sound-money
victory hoarded funds have come and are still
coming into sight again, but men do not yet
ses their way clear to launch new enterprises
which would employ vast amountsâ hence the
strength of our position, which permits us to
assume the role of lenders where we have
never before been anything but borrowers.
The important point to be noted in this
statement of facts is that "men do not see
their way clear to launch new enterprises
which would employ vast amounts." New
York may regard this as a favorable con
dition of affairs, but it will not be so con
sidered in other portions of the United
States. It is by no means satisfactory to
the great West that New York has money
to lend to the bankers and capitalists of
the Old World while she has none to send
forth for the development of the resources
of the great West.
If New Yorkers do not yet see their way
clear to launch new enterprises it is their
own fault. It is true that so long as the
Gorman tariff remains in force American
industry will be heavily handicapped. Nev
ertheless there are better opportunities in
this country for the investment of money
than any which Europe can offer. As a
matter of lact it is well known that Eu
Â»
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JJECEMBEB 15, 1896.
J ropean capitalists are now sending their
I money to South Africa, to Australia, to
I the Orient, and not infrequently to the
I United States in search of investments. It
is a sarcasm on New York enterprise that
her financiers should send their money to
Europe, and then see the Europeans who
borrowed it send it back to the great West
and invest it with profit.
The American people will of course be
glad to see New York "formally recog
nized by la haute finance of Europe as one
of the great money centers of the world,"
but they would prefer to see it show a lit
tle more American energy and enterprise.
- Our finance and our industry should be
inseparably associated, and New York is
not doing justice to either herself or the
, country when sue exults more in lending
money to Europe than in using it to de
velop the vas-t resources of the United
States.
THE FRESNO FAIR.
The Fresno citrus fair will make a pleas
ant holiday preparation for the people of
the San Joaquin and all who are fortunate
enough to be able to visit Fresno during
the continuance of the exposition. It
promises to be one of the moÃt successful
displays of the kind yet held and will
give convincing proof of the orchard
wealth of that section of toe State.
Fresno has become so famous as a cen
ter of a raisin-growing district that even
to a great many Californians it will be a
surprise to lrarn bow capable the terri
tory around about it is of becoming a great
orange producing district. The fair whi?h
has just been opened will make evident
the fact that Fresno's prosperity aoes not
depend upon a single product, but is fed
from abundant streams of revenue flowing
from widely varied resources.
It is to be hoped the attendance at the
fair will be fully commensurate with the
merits of the display. Such expositions
ought to be made profitable to those who
have Ihe enterprise to undertake them, as
well as to the community generally. Tiie
amount of good done by our citrus ex
hibits is very great. They not only draw
a large number of visitors from different
sections of the State, but attract the
attention of tourists and through them
increase the reputation of California in
all parts of the Union. They deserve,
therefore, the patronageof th- people, and
siiould receive it in a measure sufficient to
make them amply remunerative in every
instance.
There are good reasons for expecting
that Fresno will have a large number of
visitors at her fair. She now enjoys the
advantage of railroad competition, and
people who wish to attend the exposition
will therefore get the benefit of cheaper
railroad rates than they would otherwise
have done. As for the residents of Fresno,
it goes without saying they will give a
liberal support to the exposition. They
are enterprising people and know the
value of co operation. They know that
their town is on the be -inning cf a new
era of advancement and prosperity and
can be counted on to see to it that all their
local undertakings are heartily and cor
dially supported.
FiXING THE PRICES OF WHEAT.
St. Louts Globe-Democrat.
The leading organ of the British grain
trade, the Mark Lane Express, suggests the
formation of a "central chamber" represent
ing the wheat producers of the different na
tions, which shall keep its constituency in
formed of the proper time to withhold the
product from the market. In this way, it is
contended, the prices of wheat could be regu
lated for all the world and kept up to a profit
able point in spite of the conditions which
now depress values from time to time and
make wheat-raising a losing business. The
scheme looks plausible at first glance, but,
like so many other projects that look well on
the surface, it will not, bear close inspection.
There is no reason to believe that the millions
"of wheat-growers in different countries could
be induced to act together in such a way and
to be guided by tho advice of such a body to
an extent that would make the undertaking
a success.
The planters of the Bouth have tried eeveral
times to apply a policy of that kind to the pro
duction of cotton, and it has always been a
failure. It would be infinitely more difficult,
of course, to thus control the wheat output of
all nations. The thing would not work, in
short, because human nature would he against
it, and the law of demand and supply would
continue to govern the markets.
A similar proposition comes from the Czar of
Russia. He 'would have an international con
ference, with power to fix the price of wheat at
stated intervals. This is simpiy the bimetallic
tbeory applied to wiieat instead of silver, and.
for obvious reasons, would be much harder to
eniorco as to the former than as to the Utter.
It does not Involve the idea of the buying and
storing ot surplus wheat by the different gov
ernmentsâwhich would be a manifest ab
surdity by the wayâ and in the absence of
such an arrangement the prices fixed could
not possibly be maintained.
Laws might be passed imposing penalties for
buying and selling at other prices, but they
could not be enforced. The natural laws of
trade would prevail, notwithstanding these
artificial barriers, as has been frequently de
monstrated in the history of that sort of legis
lation. An international conference might
render usefui service in the collection and
dissemlnstion of facts concerning crop pros
pects and the probable tendency ot prices, but
that is all. It could not, in tne nature of
things, adjust the supply to the demand with
sufficient effect to overcome the circumstances
which now send wheat up or down. When
the product is greater than the consumption
the prices are bound to fall, aud when there
is a scarcity in some countries, as there is this
year, they are just as certain to rise. This is
the whole philosophy of the matter, and all
attempts to contravene it have failed and
must continue to fail as of teiuas they are re
peated. \

THEY GLORIFY VICE.
A. J. W., in Fresno BepubllcaD. Â«Â«. o Hr,tial
It is not alone that both the Journal and the Examtner are "â¢ n "Â« tl Â° nl "'
for, while this is not a characteristic of a high-class newspaper, worse cnarges
may be laid at the door of journalism. It is rather that both paDer* are . v
void of what may be termed, for lack of a better word, character, inej , a
devoid of moral purpose as a fish of feathers. They pander to the lower a
vicious element; they glorify vice by suggestion; they accept a su Â°=' u^ ""
a corporation to-day and damn the corporation when it is witoarawn _ to
morrow; they take a fee from the bawds of the street for advertising meir
shameful business; they are conscienceless.
SOME BENEFIT.
Berkeley uazette. â
Some good will come out of the Nazareth. The late prize-fight at san
Francisco has led to the bringing out of another fightâ this time on the side 01
good morals as applied to journalism. The San Francisco Call is dealing
some powerful blows in the cause of morality of the press, and it is to be
hoped that a better time wiil prevail throughout the land on account ol it.
There is no question but the standard of the daily press of this country needs
much elevation. It is necessary first to have the supporters of iniquity
purged and a moral stamina established which will not pander to the tastes of
the vicious.
California has suffered long enough from newspapers which are constantly
working in the interests of depravity. By their continuance the good name
of the State and country is blotched. If the morals of a community are to be
established by some of the newspapers now published in San Francisco we can
only pray that God will "help that community in its hours of distress.
IT HURTS THE MONARCH.
Sacramento County Ledger.
The roasting the Examiner baa been receiving from the interior press is
having some effect on the boiler-plate hide of the Monarch (?). Its course
during the campaign was most indecent, and to this cause more tban any
other can be attributed the failure of the silver cause in California. Many of
the interior journals which made a fight for silver were hampered by the
unwise course of the Examiner, and the good effects of their efforts were
largely overbalanced by that sheet in its endeavor to carry out its spite and
punish some personal enemy. It lost sight entirely of the one great issue
before the people in its mad endeavor to drag the Southern Pacific Company
into politics, and expended its energies in abusing the officials of that company
and all else who did not join that sheet in its dirty fight. To be a friend of
anyone connected with that company was a greater sin in the eyes of that
journal than to be a murderer, and all who had the courage to express
friendship for or support any candidate favorable to the railroad company
c ame in for their share of abuse in the columns of that paper. No depth of
degradation was too low for that sheet to stoop to if it could only carry its
point, and the decent journals who supported Bryan now feel the degradation of
being compelled to keep company with such. It has run its race and now
it is running the gauntlet, and the interior press and the people of the whole
coast are taking a whacK al it for its indecent and scandalous methods. One
thing is sure, that paper will be compelled to change its methods or else it
will be obliged to close its doors. It matters not how much money its
fortunate owner may have he cannot keep alive such an outrageously indecent
sheet as the Examiner has been for some time past.
The good-natured people of California will stand a great deal from a big
daily like the Examiner, but when it imperils the reputation of the good people
of the State in its desire to be sensational, and strikes right and left with its
abuse of everybody that it does not agree with, they will soon cry halt; in fact
they have done so already. The people are tired and disgusted with the lneth
oas of the Examiner. Its uncalled for and unwarranted attack upon our
Supreme Court because, forsooth, that tribunal happened to not agree with its
managers on points of law; its fight aeainst the Southern Pacific Company be
cnuse that corporation discontinued the payment of $1000 per month as hush
money into its coffers â tnese and many other like unjust attacks upon the in
stitutions of our State huve caused the people to become awfuily tired and very
much disgusted with that journal that once rightfully claimed the title of
'Monarch." I! it were only honest in its fight against the railroad company
some who are opposed to the company could, and would, tolerate that portion
of their iieht ; but there is not a schoolboy in the land but what knows the rea
son of its opposition is attributable more to the fact that the company refused
to be blackmailed iurtner by that paper than it is to its honest purpose to fight
the company ior the people's toed. Its charge that the interior newspapers
are subsidized and controlled fy Mr. Huntington in the interest of his railroad
is as false as the Examiner itself. No one with a grain of common-sense will
place any credit in this charge, for they are too weJl acquainted with the meth
ods of the Examtner. The interior press have revolted at the treatment re
ceived from the Examiner, and have begun to give it the lambasting it so richly
deserves, and it hurts that great big monstrosity, too, as is evidenced by its
efforts to strike back.
Letters From the People.
CLEVELAND'S COURAGE,
He Puts a Henry finger on the -Finan
.... .4. 4 , - cial Sore Spot. â¢
To the Editor â , of the 'â  San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Perhaps a majority of the American people do
not regard President Cleveland as a man of
courage, and they would refer you : ; to ' Hawaii
and Cuba; but I think they do him injustice.
In his message to Congress, December 17,1 he
boldly confronts 6.306,110 of his own country
menâbeing but; 342,057 less than half of the
whole 13,296,334 votersâ and flatly tells them'
to their faces that when they voted a month
ago for an â  increase )in the volume ,of money
and against the issue of any i more interest
bearing bonds he defies their convictions and
proposes to contract the volume of money and
issue ' bonds galore. And this in part is what
he said :â'""â¢".'â 
"I am more convinced . than , ever.; that we
can have ' ; no '-'â¢ assured :j financial ;, peace - and
safety until the Government i currency obliga
tions, i upon which ;' gold â â , may Ibe c demanded
from the treasury, are withdrawn from circu
lation and canceled. This might be done, as
has been, heretofore recommended, by their
exchange for long-term â¢ bonds bearing a low
rate of interest, or by their redemption with
the proceeds of such bonds. This plan of issu
ing boud* for the purpose of redemption cer
tainly appears to be toe roost effective and di
rect path- to the ? needed 1 ; reform. National
banks should * redeem their own notes. They
should be allowed Â»to issue, circulated >to the
par value of bonds deposited as security for its
redemption," and the >tnx on their circulation
should be reduced to J^ oi(l per cent." â 
â  I want every man wno has a few dollars in
vested in business or has. a job at which he
earns a living to weigh well these words from
Mr. Cleveland's message and \ consider deeply
what , here j follows: \ "This â¢â¢ plan ; of c, issuing
bonds," he "certainly appears to be the
most effective ana direct path; to the â¢ needed
reform" and the significance of : ; what â : he
says lies in the lact that he speaks for the so
called National banks and other fundholders
of the country. â ,â ' Wiih this t plan , adopted { and
carried out he undertakes to say that "we can
have assured financial peace and safety. " r '.\ 'â¢'
1 pass by the other obnoxious form of Jov
ernment â â , paper money known 'as â¢ "treasury
notes," issued in payment of silver purchased
under the Bland-Allison act and the Sherman
law of 1890, amounting to $129,683,-280, by
remarking that $35,112,421 of rlt lias been
"retired" and canceled,; contrary to law, dur
ing the past year, thus contracting the cur
rency of , the country when money is so scarce
at the rate of. $3,000,000 a monthâ a lact that
ought to arouse the indignation of | every man
in business throughout â ; the ; country ; | for at
that rate in: three years more the last dollar
of this form ot full legal lender paper money
will disappear, and this will ' leave the ; dead
silver idle in the treasury. ':
â ! According to the treasury reports there are
$340,681,016 in ; old i legal-tender .; notes or
greenbacks of the Issues of February 25, 1862,
July 11, 1862, and March 3, 1863. still iv ex
istence, though it iis not probable that more
than $300,000,000 do exist, for the act of June
21,1879, estimated the I loss of the fractional
currency at that date to be $8,375,934 out of
; the $50,000,000 ; issued, which is about 6 per
cent in 1 seventeen years. The greenbacks
would be â¢:â â  destroyed s by * fire, by sea and by
other ways quite as last, and in thirty-four
years the loss of only 10 per cent would leave
but $312,012,917. Kln a word, by the use of
paper * money ? the i Nation ;* has j undoubtedly
gained $46,681,016 in! thirty- four years. â â¢ Mr.
Cleveland ana his banker friends then propose
to place at least $300,000,000 in bonds, bear
ing ' interest, in * exchange * for i that sum in
greenbacks in order to supply them with that
amount in bonds on which to issue banknotes
to the full ' face 1 value . of \ the bonds \at one
quarter of 1 per cent interest. :.*. v;
! Now why does he thus ; crave the expressed
opposition of almost ; one-half of r the Â« voting
population of the country? Why does he tor
ture the patience of so many; indignant peo
ple? He claims that his object is to prevent
lurther raids on the gold of ; the % treasury, and
assigns no other ostensible 1 reason. In order
not to heap up $100,000,000 of idle gold in
the treasury to redeem greenbacks as they are
presented by .money-mongers ?. or 5 dealers \ in
money he s would i destroy ; the i Government
money itself and let the banks issue their bills
in place of it, thereby putting the whole vol
ume of money in' the hands ;of private specu
lators in money. "â â â¢:-â¢:':, â '.â .'. â .-'â '--^v."- 'â -â â â  â 
v-In the beginning of the war, July 17, 1861,
Congress authorized the issue of bonds and
treasury notes to the amount of $250,000,000,
"these notes to be of a less denomination than
$50, not bearing Interest, but payable on de
mand at the Assistant. Treasurer's office," and
$50,000,000 of these "demand notes," as they
were called, were issued,' but the bankers re
rused to receive them, and thus succeeded in
discrediting them in that ; dark hour lof the
Nation's peril. Congress was loyal to the peo
ple, however, at " that ) time,' and ; six months
later, February 12. 1862, an act was passed
making these "demand notes" a full legal ten
der for all debts and dues, public and private,
and authorized "the issue of like notes to the
amount of $10,000,000 additional, said notes
to be deemed part of the loan of $290,000 000
authorized by act of July 17, 1861."
Does any reader of Thk Call, except the
bankers, know the history of these "demand
dotes" iroin that date? President Cleveland
and the bankers know. It is the one form of
Government money they most of all abomi
nate. Those "demand notes" went instantly
to par with gold February 12, 1862, on the
passage of the act making them full legal ten
der for all debts and dues, and there they re
mained absolutely at par with gold when
greenbacks were "worth" but 35 cents on the
dollar measured in gold, because they per
formed all the functions of gold itsolf in the
affairs of the Nation and between individual
citizens, and hence they could not depreciate
below the par of gold. The reader can well
Imagine the consternation created by these
"dtmand notes" among the goldmongers or
dealers in gold.
In two weeks alter the passage of this act of
FeDrunry 12, clothing the "demand notes"
with the full legal tender function, tne bank
ers of Boston, New York and Pniladelphla
gathered in Washington to deal a deathblow
to this new National money, 'and another act
was passed February 25, 1862. author. zing
"the issue, on the credit of the United States
of $150,000,000 of United States notes [ie
greenbacks], not bearing interest, not less
than $5 eacn.provided that $50,000,000 of said
notes shall be in lieu of the 'demand treasury
notes' authorized to be issued by the act of
July 17, 1861, which said 'demand notes'
shall be taken up as rapidly as possible and
the noies herein provided for substituted for
them; â¦ â¢ and sucn notes herein authorized
shall be receivable in payment of taxes, inter
nal duties, excises, debts and demands of
every kind due to the United States, except
duties on imports, and of all claims and de
mands against the United States of every kind
whatsoever, except for interest upon bonds
and notes, which shall be paid in coin, and
said United States notes [1. c. greenbacks] shall
a: so De lawful money and a legal tender in the
payment of all debts in the United States, ex
cept duties on imports and interest as afore
said."
There you have the two infamous stabs in the
back on the greenback, the "except for inter
est on bonds" and "except duties on imports,"
the Government itself repudiating its own
money wherein It favored bondholders and
dealers in gold, which importers had to buy to
pay duties with, and this alone made it possi
ble, with the "demand notes" called in and
exchanged for these 'except" greenbacks, to
force them down below par with gold. But the
people clung to the "demand notes" and
would not exchange them for the poor crippled
greenbacks, and so it became necessary to try
so force them to give up the demand notes by
another act of Congress passed a year later
March 3, 1863 (section 17), withdrawing the
privilege ot exchanging them for interest
bearing bonds by July I thereafter. In fact
there was the most determined effort made to
get these "demand notes" out of the hands of
business men, who found them as good as gold
in paying import duties or for any other pur
pose which gold could accomplish.
Here is a way out for President Cleveland
without destroying a single dollar of Govern
ment money. Let him call for an issue ol suf
ficient treasury demand notes to redeem these
crippled greenbacks or simply get the law re
pealed which contains the two "exception"
clauses, and then these green Decks wil! 00 all
that gold can do, and that will end the raid on
the gold reserve; but it will spoil the game of
the money-mongers. 8 B M

money from "retirement" and cancellation

Treasury Notesâ J. H. S., Alameda, Cal.
The first issue of "greenbacks" under the
Lincoln administration was not for $60,000,

the act of February 25, 1862. tbere was an
authorization for the issue of $150,000,000 in
United biates notes, of which $50,000,000
was to be applied to the redemption of de
mand notes authorized by the act of July 17,
1861. These greenbacks fluctuated as did
those of subsequent issues and did not always
maintain parity with gold. The issue under
the act of July 17, 1861, was $139,999,750.
Prior to that by an act of March 2, 1861,
treasury notes were Issued to the amouut of
$35,364,450, of which $22,469,100 was re
deemable in two years, and $12,896,350 sixty
days from date. These went at rates ranging
from par to 127. Those of the issue of July,
1861, went at an average premium oi

Louie's Sorrow.
The funeral of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper
and her daughter Harriet, held at the
First Congregationnl Church at the noon
hour yesterday, was one of tbe most
solemn and well-attended services known
in the history of the City.
Not only was the church packed to over
flowing, but some idea of the respect in
which the noted founder of local kinder
gartens nnd her daughter were held may
be gained from the fact that brawny work
men stood inside, even when the rain fell
in light showers, with their heads barren
of all covering. Nor were their eyes dry
as the faint, sad strains of the funeral an
thems floated out the door and testified
that the last rites had begun.
It was known that the services would
not begin till the hour of noon, but never
theless the throngs began make their
appearance as early as 9:30 o'clock and by
11:30 o'clock, the time the doors were
opened, a dense mass of people crowded
the street and sidewalks of Post street for
a block each way.
This vast multitude that assembled at
the First Congregational Church was one
of the most remarkable features. All
classes of San Francisco society were rep
resented, and many among those who
mourned came from suburban cities and
towns. Thousands of people went to the
church who could not gain admission,
and among them were many representa
tive men and women of the City. The
police officers had no diffimlty in man
aging the crowd and as a result travel on
Post street was not suspended for any
great length of time.
When the service inside was completed
and word came out that the caskets were
uncovered the police had ail they could do
to prevent a promiscuous crowding into
the church. Finally an order was adopted
to allow all persons desiring to view the
remains to pass in through the door on
Post street, nearest Mason, and to emerge
from another door, tbe one nearest Powell.
Tne central doorway was thus kept clear.
After the people, the great majority of
whom were women, had been passing in
and out for more than an hour the mul
titude outside had not apparently dimin
ished. Nearly all preferred to remain un
til the caskets were borne from the altar
to the hearses.
At 11 o'clock Dr. McLean delivered a
very brief prayer at the house. Many of
the friends of the deceased were present,
and took a last look at the features they
had learned to know so well.
There was no attempt at decoration at
Mrs. Cooper's residence. Both caskets
lay Bide by side in the drawing-room.
They were entirely concealed by a floral
matting of chrysanthemums, violets,
white roses and evergreens.
Besides the mat a simple wreath of ever
greens with a card attached lay on Mrs.
Cooper's coffin. It read: "To my mother;
from Louie." Louie was the Chinese ser
vant who has been an occupant of Mrs.
Cooper's household for fifteen years. He
attended the church in company with
George T. Gaden.and sat well to the front.
His face, as near as can be expressed by
the stolid countenance of an Oriental, told
his realization that he had lost a valuable
and trusted friend.
The funeral cortege proceeded from the
residence down Vallejo street to Van
Ness avenue, along van Ness to Post
street, out thence to the church. There
were required forty carriages to convey
tne friends of the dead woman and her
daughter to her destination. The two
hearses conveying the remains were pre
ceded by five carriages carrying the pall
bearers and nearest friends. Mrs. Coop
er's hearst was first, followed by that con
taining tne daughter.
There was some delay at the church
owing to the fact that difficulty was expe
rienced by the police in making a passage
THE SAN FRACNISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1896.
way for the pallbearers through the im
mense crowd which blocked the entrance.
But the cortage iinally was able to make
its way into the church and the remains
of both mother and doughter were borne
to the foot of the pulpit.
As this was done the vast congreeation
rose to its feet as one man and the organ
sounded faintly the sad strains of Chopin's
Funeral March. Those actimr as pall
bearers were: Professor Earl Barnes,
Horace Davis, W. J. Dutton, Dr. J. T. Mc-
Donald, Major Hooner, C. J. LatbroD,
Lovell I White, John Taylor, Edwin Swee
ney, D. Hewes, John F. Merrill, E. J.
Ralston, S. \V. Levy and J. F. Foster
The mourning party seemed to be com
posed of ali the older members of the
church and wa3 lea by Rev. Dr. J. K. Mc-
Lean of Oakland and Rev. Geor/e C.
Adams, the present pastor of the First
Congregational Church. They were closely
followed by Mr. and Mrs. Hale and Mrs.
Pearson of San Quemin, Wong Louie, the
Chinese servant; Warren Bartnett and
Mr. and Mr?. Georjre T. Gaden. .
After them came the members of the
church, the Bible clas?, the Women's
Congress and the various other organiza
tions in which Mrs. Cooper had been a
shining light.
When all were seated the choir sang
"Thy Will Be Done." All the songs of
the service were favorites of Mrs. Cooper,
their selection having been left to Samuel
D. Mayer, tenor singer and director of the
church choir. Mrs. B. E. Paiton sanfr
soprano, Mrs. A. E. Story contralto and
J. F, Fleming bass.
Before the service began it was found nec
essary by the police to lock the doors lead
ing to the galleries as a measurcof precau
tion. They feared that some disaster
might happen ij more people were allowed
there. As it was the vast edifice was fillea
almost to suffocation, every seal being
filled and numbers being arranged along
the side of the auditorium and the gallery.
Besides tbe different organizations' with
which Mrs. Cooper had neeu associated,
such as the Century Club, the Golden
Gate Kindergarten Association, the Asso
ciated Charities, the Pacific Coast
Women's Press Association, the State
Suffrage Association and the Women's
Congress, many uniforms of red and
blue in the congregation showed that the
Salvation Army was out in force. Mrs.
Cooper had been a foremost leader in the
auxiliary corps of that great body, and a
remark she is credited with once having
made, "I sometimes feel that I could do
better work if 1 were to don the bonnet of
a Salvation lassie," had been remembered
and appreciated.
The jiulpii had been decorated by Miss
Mary Bates' own hands, as she would en
trust this snered duty to no one els". Bhe
herself contributed the waving palms that
so gracefully overtopped the floral offer
ings on each side. Violets, Mrs. Cooper's
favorite flowers, were present in profusion
in the form of bouquets and wreaths, and
the Century Club memoers held small
boaquets of that sweet-scented flower in
their hands.
Large quantities of hyacinths were
drooped over the pulpit on all sides. A
pillar of white hydrangeas stood on the
left and chrysanthemums mingled with
palms to form a beautiful white cross, on
whose pedestal the word "Peace" was
written in violets. Roses of every de
scription, La France and Marechal Niel
principally, and St Joseph's lilies in
abundance, exhaled their fragrant per
fume throughout the building. From the
reading desk nung a dark-green ivy
wreath.
The floral tributes so fittinely woven
into a bower of beauty by Miss Bates'
bkillful hands were the gift of the follow
ing persons: Mrs. Leland Stanford, on
whose card was written, "She never grew
weary in doing good; she had a willing
heart, a most precious gift in God's
siKlit"; Mrs. William Willis, Miss Susan
B. Anthony, Miss Sbaw (a bunch of yel
low and white chrysanthemums), David
Hewes, Mrs. C. R. Pechin, principal of
the Cooper Primary School; Mrs. L.
Schwabacher, Dr. George W. Merrill, Dr.
Emma Sntro Merritt, the Pioneer Kinder
earten, the little children of the Lester
Norrls Kindergarten, Mrs. Talbot, the
Golden Gate Kindergarten, Mrs. Pope,
Mrs. F. A. Frank, the Cooper Memorial
Church, Major Hooper, Mr. and Mrs.
Louis Sloss, Mrs. Bailey Gatzert of Seattle,
who formed a kindergarten under Mrs.
Cooper's direction, and Mrs. Hearst. A
lovely wreath of orchids wbs sent by Mrs.
W. Joy of St. Louis, one of Mrs. Cooper's
most intimate friends. In addition were
the gift of violets of the Chinese servant
and a bouquet signed simply, "From
Hazel."
Dr. McLean began the ccemonies by a
scriptural reading, that appropriate part
of First Corinthians usually read In
funeral services, containing the words,
"O Death, where is thy sting? O Grave,
where is thy victory?" The choir then
s-atig without accompaniment, "0 Para
dise, O Paradise," Mrs. Cooper's favorite
hymn.
Dr. Geor?e C. Adams led in prayer.
"My words," he said, "will be very brief.
I can speak only of what I have myself
seen. One of the first to greet me by let
ter was the one who wrote tenderly of
| God's work in the churcli. One of the
very first to greet mo was this woman,
with her longing for peace in Christ.
"Then followed interviews in that home
so full of Christian experience, interviews
tnat showed how completely her soul was
engrossed in the work of the Master. Yet
there seemed something mysterious in the
yearning way her heart reached to God, a
mystery that puzzled me till now.
"This is a remarkable funeral. Two
lives have passed away and a whole city is
in mourning. Flags all over town are at
hal/mast. There must ne<-ds have been a
strong and virtuous Jife behind this. Her
life must have been spent in tbe glorifying
of God. It has been said that he who
makes two blades of grass crow where
only one grew before is a benefactor of
humanity, but she did something more
than that. -She brought joy and the
knowledge of Christ into countless Chris
tian homes; she performed well her duty
both to God and man.
"We are naturally tempted to ask in a
case like this, who can fill this noble
woman's place? From my experience, I
am warranted in saying that God can take
bis own at any time to work in a higher
sphere ana still leave plenty behind to
continue the labor on earth. God help
you, friends, in following up the work of
uplifting humanity which they have left
undone."
The choir followed with "In the Blest
Evermore" without accompaniment. The
venerable Dr. J. K. McLean then arose to
deliver the funeral oration and the audi
ence hung with strained uttention on
every word. He began slowly and delib
erately, speaking with a deep, solemn
conviction, and continued in this manner
to the end. His words were in substance
as follows:
Our dead influence us all the more, simply
because they are dead. All the good that they
have done in life comes to us all the more
cleariy now that they have gone away from
us. Their ideals have become a reality, it
seems, simply because they are no more.
We can never esr.imate the character of our
friends at all until they have departed from
us through the gateway of death, for one rea
son, because there is no reason why we should
sit down and take account of all our friends'
qualities and characteristics while they are
with us. We come in contact with them, one
after another, and enjoy them or criticize
them Â»s the case may be, but we never take
them into account in that connection so long
as our friends are with us, but as soon as the
will of Providence is manifested and they are
called away from us that character is set unon
a pedestal and a new light is thrown upon it.
Oftentimes we see and admire traits that
haa impressed us but slightly in their life
time. I shuii not attempt to spenk of all the
traits of cheracter of Mrs. Cooper, in whom
principally our interest centers to-day,
although with a most pathetic interest do we
regard that other life and charaoter that was
so interwoven with hers. So I shall speak
chiefly oi Mrs. Cooper.
I hare set down certain things that strike
me now and that had impressed me before.
As I see these qualities combined they make
in my mind a character of exceeding rare
worth, qualities rare in themselves and in the
combination which is almost extraordinary.
Firstof all was thedelicate physical organiza
tion of Mrs. Cooper. Unusually delicate was she
in physical structure, fine-celled was she phy
sically. And inhabiting that physical organi
zation very strikingly did we see wonderful
gentleness of spirit. She was a gentlewoman
in any and every sense of that word. Ah, and
this gentleness of spirit was accompanied
by almost extraordinary tiffeciionateness.
She loved deeply, strongly, permanently.
There was a loyalty in her lovo which meant
much. Deeply, wonderfully nff .-ctionate.
And, resulting from these qualities, in com
bination comes another as rare, but a quality
almost to be dreaded and shrunk from â a spir
itual sensitiveness to pain and sufferingâ one
of those physiques which always very keenly
feel suffering or every kind, physically, men
tally, emotionally.
Particularly when combined with the quali
ties I have already named is strong convic
tion, and Mrs. Cooper was a woman of very
strong convictions upon, almost every subject, |
MRS. SARAH B. COOPER.
IN MEMORI/^.
In a womanly form a great soul dwelt,
And she gave her life for good ;
And the children, who loved her teachings, ftlt
The Christ in her womanhood.
"Of such is the Kingdom," the Master said,
As he took them one by one;
And thousands were gathered to mourn her, dead,
And wept that her work was done.
Such types of Christ have not lived in vain,
It is well that they were born ;
They can feel with passion, and weep with pain,
And comfort the heart forlorn.
She died, whose life was a service of love,
As the Master, died before.
Peace ! peace 1 to her ashes, and rest above,
Forever, and ever more.

large and small. Her opinion was definite,
decisive; her feeling about it was, after her
own mind, unquestionable. Her opinions
were clear cut and definite, and, connected
with the other qualities I have named, added
marvelously to her power of suffering.
The keen, quick, simple sensibility, and
keen, vivid sensibility that made distinctions
readily and'accurately and minutely Detween
right and wrong â this was a prominent char
acteristic of our dear, departed friend, and
with this extreme conscientiousness she car
ried a sense of responsibility about her.
Dr. McLean continued for borne time in
the same analytical strain. He instanced
the case of the Chinese servant, Wong
Louie, who was so accustomed to hearing
Mrs. Cooper moving about at an early
hour in the morning, that when he did
not hear his mistress in the kitchen at
that hour, he immediately divined some
thing was wrong. If this was not an ex
ample of tireless energy he had never
known of one.
He then referred to her kindergarten
work. It assumed form, he said, when
she was a mere child. She was in the
South, and her first solicitude was to
teach the little ones whose parents she
was succoring. It was her experience
there that afterward proved of so great
benefit in juvenile work in this City.
Duty was a passion with her.
Eighteen thousand souls could testify,
according to the speaker, to the good Mrs.
Cooper had done among the kindergar
tens here, and in this work her daughter
was a perfect helpmate and ably assisted
in carrying out the work the mother de
signed. It was a case of the sun and the
moon. Where tbe main body went the
satellite was always present.
Dr. McLean also eloquently referred to
the good work accomplished by Mrs.
Cooper in the cause of woman and the
wholesome results of her sayings and
writings. In conclusion he referred
touchingly to her sufferings in life and
her sad end.
The services concluded with a prayer by
Pastor Aaams and the singing by the
choir of tne hymn "Good Night, I Am
Going Home."
The vast concourse was then given an
opportunity to view the remains. It took
just one hour and a half for all to get a
last glimpse of Mrs. Cooper's calm, serene
countenance and the emotionless face of
her daughter.
The funeral cortege proceeded from the
church to the Masonic Cemetery, where
the remains of Mia. Cooper and her daugh
ter were laid to rest beside that of thÂ« hus
band and father. Dr. McLean conducted
the services at the grave, which were very
brief. He was assisted by the choir.
Mostly friends of the deceased were pres
ent, owing to a confusion about the place
of interment.
Rev. Dr. Matthew, editor of the Metho
dist Christian Advocate, yesterday re
ceived a telegram from New York, sent by
Miss Frances Willard, which read: "Un
speakable grief at losa of Mrs. Cooper.
Please send San Francisco papers."
A FUNERAL THIEF.
Caught In the Act of Picking the
Pocket of an Oakland Lady.
The immense concourse of people at
tending the Cooper obsequies ai the First
Congregational Church yesterday tempted
thieves and pickpockets to resort there.
Mrs. Gibbs of 2102 Peralta street, Oakland,
had her pocket picked while standing in
the vestibule of the church, but the thief
did not get away with her wallet. Her
daughter saw the thief in the act of put
ting his hand in her mother's pocket and
gave tbe alarm. Mrs. Gibbs instantly
perceived that her purse was missing, and
Police Officers F. W. Riley and Dlnan were
summoned. The officers found the purse
on the floor where the thief presumably
dropped it when the daughter gave the
alarm.
The officers had some difficulty in get
ting through the crowd to tbe immedi
ate scene of tbe theft. Tbe accused de
clared that he was innocent, but the
daughter of Mrs. Gibbs identified him pos
itively as the person whose hand was in
her mother's pocket. The man said that
he arrived in San Francisco on the Zea
iandia a shvit time since. The account of
himself which he gave to th*> police was
not of a character to estabJ. h his inno
cence. A bracelet was placiil on his
wrist and he was led to the California
street police station, where he was booked
as James Han ley, aged 27 years.
MRS. COOPER'S WILL.
Olotrraphlc In Form It Does Not
Meet the Code's Requirement.
That tne will of the late Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper is invalid is a fact that was con
ceded by all lawyers who had an oppor
tunity of examining it after it was filed
in the office of the County Clerk.
The will purports to be what is known
as an olographic will, but does not fulfill
the requirements for such a document.
In order to De olojrraphic in the true
sense, the courts say, a will must be en
tirely in the handwriting of the testator.
The courts have decided that this rule laid
down by the code must be construed
strictly, and the slightest deviation, how
ever trivial it may appear to the mind of a
person who is neitber a lawyer nor a
Judge, is sufficient to absolutely vitiate
and annul the instrument altogether.
There seems to be but one defect in Mrs.
Cooper's will. It was all written by her
own hand except part of tne date, which
appeared in print on the letter-head of
the Golden Gate Kindergarten Associa
tion. In filling out the date Mrs. Cooper
wrote Oct. 9, and after the printed figures
"189. ." she added the figure "6," indicat
ing tbe current year and intending the
whole to be read "189 G." If Mrs. CooDer
had written all these figures with her o\vn
hand the olographic character of her will
could not be questioned, but her failure
in this regard renders it of no effect.
It is not known that any contest will be
made on the ground of the failure of the
will to comply with the requirements of
the code, and'it is thought that her wishes
will be complied with in the distribution
of her estate, irrespective of technicalities.

WILL SOON BUILD.
Presbyterian Orphanage and Farm Re
solves to Utilize thÂ« Land at
San Anselmo.
At a meeting of the Presbyterian Or
phanage and Farm yesterday it was re
solved to make an effort to raise funds for
commencing to build on tbe farm at San
Anselmo early in the new year. Shares of
from one dollar upward will be issued im
mediately, and it is hoped that by this
means $700 can be raised in a few weeks.
The directors already have $300 in hand
toward the building fund, and when the
thousand mark is reached the work will
begin.
It was resolved that at the next meeting
arrangements should be made for having
plans drawn out. The general opinion
was that a $10,000 building should be
erected.
BICYCLES AT AUCTION.
A Long Line of High-Grade Wheels to
Be Sold To-Day.
It is seldom that a lot of high-grade
bicycles find their way into an auction
room to be sold without reserve or limit
to the highest bidders. This, however,
will be the case to-day. Davis, Haber
& .Co., the auctioneers, of 211 Pine
street, will sell by order of George
Webb Alexander a number of Yost-
Falcon and Warner wheels, the sale
commencing this morning at 11 o'clock.
The bicycles in question will comprise a
line of 1896 models, which will include
tandems and juvenile wheels. The high
character of the Yost - Falcon, as
well as the Warnet wheels, is too well
known to require commendation. Mr.
Alexander, the agent, is anxious to make
room for his 1897 stock, and has therefore
inaugurated a public sale as the quickest
way to dispose of thia year's wheels. A
broad and liberal guarantee will go with
each bicycle. *
Postal Station Changes.
Postoffica stations B and II will soon be re
moved to better quarters. Station H is to be
changed from Laguna street and Ivy avenue
to Hayes and Laguna streets. Station Bis at
present located on City Hall square. It will

THE EASTERN MEN
PUNCHED TOO HARD
Rochette and Anthony De
feated in Ten-Round
Contests.
Spirited Boxing Bouts That Took
Piace in Woodward's
Pavilion,
Gans, the Colored Pugilist, Knocked
Rochette Out With a Right
on the Chin-
Yonng Mitchell, who is director-general
of the Occidental Athletic Club, refereed
the contest held at "Woodward's Pavilion
last evening. Jimmy Anthony, the
sturdy little Australian pugilist, fought
ten rounds with Jack Ward of Newark,
N. J. Anthony was the aggressor in
every round and twice during the mill he
had his opponent on "Queer street," bnt
Ward invariably came up to the scratch at
the call of time looking fresh. The East
ern man scored the greatest number of
leads during the mill and frequently
planted a swinging right on the Austra
lian's neck at long range. Anthony was
handicapped in reach of arms and failed
to administer punishment excepting at
close ranjre. His blows were frequently
short, as Ward kept continually on the re
treat and thereby avoided punishment.
Young Mitchell gave his decision in favor
of Ward, he having landed the most
blows. Many of the spectators thought
that a draw would have given better sat
isfaction.
Gans, the colored Baltimorean, is a very
polished fighter. He fiddled around Ko
chette untii the fourth round, when the
opportunity he hoped for came, and as
quick as a flash he planted his rigbt fist
on Rochette's chin and the San Francisco
boy went down. He regained his feet,
however, bofore ten seconds were counted,
and fought his opponent while in a dazed
state until the timely sound of the gong
saved, him from what certainly would
have been a ciean knockout. While rest
ing in his corner the seconds of Rochette
threw up the sponge, as they were only
too well aware that Rochette was a gone
goose.
Neil, tne horseman, sprang into the
ring after the fighters had left for their
dressine-rooms and made a-go-as-you
please speech. He said that his boy
Hawkins would give Gans another chance
to redeem bis lost laurels by fighting him
a ten -round contest under tne auspices of
the Occidental Club under the same con
ditions they fought in the East when
"honest" John Kelly gave tne fight to
Hawkins.
Several expert judges who witnessed
last evening's fight were of the opinion
that Gans could easily dispose of Hawkins
or any other fighter of his class in the
State. Tiie contest by rounds are as fol
lows:
It was exactly 9 o'clock when Jimmy
Anthony of Australia and his seconds, Arthur
WiilKer and Frank Savage, entered the ring.
Jack Ward of Newark and his attendants,
H.ues, Uerford and Sullivan, soon followed.
The fighters scaled exactly 115 pounds, and
they looked to be trained to the hour. Master
oi Ceremonies Billy Jordan announced that
t."ie contest would be ten rounds, and that
â  Young Mitchell would referee the bout in the
interest o! square sport.
In the first round Anthony got home some
telling short-arm blows, but Ward lauded sev
eral lung-distance shots, which made Anthony
look a bit cautious.
In the second round Ward, who was fighting
very cool, cut Anthony with a right over the
leiteye and very cleverly got away from the
Australian's rushing tactics. The Baltimore
lad had certainly the best of the mill up to
this point of the game.
In the third round Anthony opened the
game by planting v good right on Ward's ribs,
uut the receiver returned the compliment
with a straight left in the face. Both men
v.ere lighting cleverly. Anthony was the
aggressor and Ward danced away from him,
but just as the gong sounded he swung his
right and caught Anthony a heavy punch on
the side of the jaw.
In the fourth round Anthony landed a heavy
right in the stomach, but Ward got home on
the Australian's head very hard. In a rally
that followed Anthony smashed Ward on the
nose, drawing blood. The Australian now
commenced to bore in upon his Opponent and
scored a hard body punch at chort range.
In the fifth round Anthony had Ward on the
retreat and landed a swinging right as the
Baltimore boy attempted to sidestep. Ward
relied entirely on a right swing, which he fre
quently landed on the Australian's neck, out
generally too far back to have the desired
effect. Anthony had all the best of the latter
part of this round.
In the sixth round Anthony rushed his game
and puzzled Ward by his movements. The
Baltimore lad was continually on the retreat,
but he landed the most blows nevertheless. In
the middle of the round Ward slipped aud fell,
but was up quickly. Anthony Landed a heavy
right-hander on Ward's jaw just as the gong
sounded.
In the seventh round there was some hot ex
changes, but Anthony came within an ace of
doing his man with a left-hand swing in the
stomach, which he followed up by a right on
neck. Ward went to his corner a very sick
looking man.-
In the eighth round Anthony rushed Ward
and some hot give-and-take blows resulted.
The Baltimore boy did well, but his blows
were not as effective as those of the Aus
tralian. Ward broke ground repeatedly.
In the ninth round Anthony had to chase
Ward all over the ring, and when the gong
sounded the man from Baltimore was very
weak. Anthony's face showed the signs of
the punches he received at long range.
The tenth round was the most exciting of
all. Anthony chased Ward from post to post,
and in so doing received several hard swings
on tne met. Anthony could not get close
enough torus opponent to inflict severe pun
ishment. At the end of the mill Anthony was
certainly the fresher man, as Ward retired to
his corner in a very weak condition.
Young Mitchell gave a decision in favor
of Ward, but there were many people pres
ent who thought that Anthony was enti
tled to the award
It was stated after the fight that Ward
injured bin right hand badly in the fourth
round when he caught Anthony on the
head with a swinging blow. The betting
was $10 to $4 in favor of Anthony.
The second event of the evening was a
ten-round contest between Charlie Ro
chette of this City and Joe Gans (colored)
of Baltimore, Md.
The referee selected was Young Mitchell.
First round â Gans "led wickedly with richt
at body and Rochette countered on neck. Ro
chelte was swinging wilu, and in a few sec
onds landed a heavy left on Gans* jaw. Both
landed lefts on neck. Rocbette stopped (ians
with a rattling good left on the chin. Rocnette
hÂ«d all the best of the round, but Gans was
fighting cool and seemingly sizing up his
game.
In the second round Gans moved up close
and landed a stiff left swing on Rochette's
neck. Guns made matters very warm for Ro
chette in a rally, landing right and lert ou Ro
chettc's neck. He also gave Rocnette a warm
reception just as the gong sounded.
In the third round there were some very
clever blows exchanged and honors were about
even. Gans, however, missed by an inch a
lef i hook, which would have done damage had
it landed.
In the fourth round Rochette scored two
good blows on his opponent's ribs and neck.
Gans moved quickly to one side and, as Ro
chette followed him, the colored lad turned
quickly and catching the Californian off his
guard he planted a right on Rochette's chin
which landed Charles on his back. Rochette
regained his pins after being down seven or
eight seconds and fought Gans gamely against
the ropes, although in a very dazed state.
The gong sounded, and when Rocnette was
assisted to his corner his seconds gave up the
fight.
Held for Perjury.
Frederick Baasc-r, a saloon-keeper, was yes
terday held to answer before the Superior
Court by Judge Joacnimsen on a charge ol
perjury in $2000 bonds. The charge arose out
of a charge of battery made by Baaser's father
in-law, John Kidne*y, ex-lieutenant in Coxey's
army. About a month ago Kidney went to
Baaser's saloon and because Baascr refused to
give him liquor Kidney threatened to kill him.
Baaser was compelled to take a bungstarter
and beat Kidney over the head with it. When
the case was heard Baaser made a general
denial of the whole business, aud the Judge
ordered a-charge of perjury to be made against
him.
WIDOW LAURA JAMES.
Her Father Testifies That He Was Told
of the Contract Marriage With
the Old Doctor.
Judge Coffey has admitted in evidence
the contract of marriage that was signed
by the late Dr. Charies A. James, aged 60,
and Laura Milen James, aeed 20, the latter
being now an applicant for the $30,000 es
tate left by the deceased.
There was a great deal of argument over
the admission of the contract in which
Dr. James and Laura Milen asserted that
they took eacb other "for husband and
wife in the sight of God and man."
Attorney Shadburne, who represents
the Eastern heirs, thought the- paper was
of no value, as its signing'did not appear
to have been followed by the assumption
of marital obligations and duties as re
quired by the laws of California.
Attorneys Hart and Cotton insisted that
the document ougnt to be admitted in
evidence, and that if it is not sufficiently
supported to establish its validity tne
court may in the end reject it.
Judge Coffey acquiesced in this view,
and the taking of testimony was begun.
Dr. Theodore Milen, father of Mrs.
James, the claimant, testified on bis
daughter's behalf. He said that be re
ceived a letter from Dr. James asking for
permission to marry nis daughter Laura,
and bad not replied directly to the aged
suitor, but had written from Redding to
Mrs. Milen, Laura's stepmother, express
ing his assent. Soon after that he re
turned from Redding, and he thus de
scribes his meeting with Dr. James:
At about 7:30 that evening I met the doctor
in our rooms. My wife had a luncheon pre
pared, consisting of tamales, crackers, pickles
and beer or wine. When Dr. James came in I
said, "Doctor, I suppose this is my son." He
said, 'Yts; if this is your daughter, for she is
my wife."
Then we had lunch. They remained about
an hour and a half. Thtit was the evening of
the 12th of January, 1895. I met him the
next (Sunday) evening, the 13th, in his office â
his back parlor. His wife, my daughter, was
there. I asked him: "Doctor, how about the
marriage contract? My people are old-fash
ioned Methodists and won't understand it. I
understand this is not legal outside of Cali
fornia."
I had previously asked Laura to leave the
room and she had done so. He pulled out a
paper, this contract, and I read it twice over
myself. He said he would provide for "the
little one," as he called her. I went to San
Jose the next day to practice medicine.
The letter of Dr. James was shown to
the witness, who said:
I received 1 that soon after the date. I did
not answer it, but returned to 925 Howard
s.reet that night. The following day I went
to San Jose and remained there until 1 heard
of Dr. James' death.
Dr. Milen will be cross-examined by At
torney Shadburne to-morrow. â

LIGHTING THE STREETS.
All the City Thorough fare* Will Soon
Be Illuminated With Elec
tricity.
Every indication points to the early
illumination of the entire City by power
ful electric arc lights. The efforts of the
Merchants' Association in this direction
nave bsen ably championed by A. S.
Baldwin, the chairman of the com
mittee upon public affairs. Additional
subscriptions have been received for two
more lights on Stockton street, between
Greet* and Union, and they have been at
once ordered installed.
The association now contemplates the
installation of arc lights upon Grant
avenue, from O'Farrell street to Bush.
The project of illuminating Market
street has been favorably received by the
property-owners and tenants along that
thoroughfare. Mr. Baldwin has sug
gested tnat if the contributions are suf
ficient, a large number of arc lights will
be installed on Market street, from the
water front to Valencia street. In the
center of this thoroughfare there will be
suspended arc lights in various colars, if
possible those of the next carnival, and
along tne sides of the street there will be
many white arc lights. Market street,
from the bay to Third, is dark at night, as
well as that portion from Sixth to Valen
cia. It is hoped that the new illumina
tion will brighten and lighten the entire
thoroughfare from the water front to
Valencia street. This will produce a
most inviting spectacle to the many visi
tors who reach the City by the femes.
The Merchants' Association takes pleas-,
ure in now announcing the following
streets as having been provided with toe
improved lighting. In some 'of these
streets the lights are already in operation,
while in others they will soon be installed :
Eearny, from Geary to Pacific; Montgom
ery avenue, from Kearny to Stockton;
Stockton, from Pacific to Union; Bush,
from Kearny to Grant avenue; Sutter,
from Montgomery to Grant avenue; Post,
from Kearny to Grant avenue; Geary,
from Kearny to Grant avenue; Third, fiom
Market toTownsend; Fourth, from Mar
ket to Harrison ; Sixth, from Market to
Harrison; Ninth, from Market to How
ard; Taylor, from Golden Gate avenue to
Eddy; Fillmore, from Suiter to Clay;
Powell, from Market to Geary ; Lurkin,
from McAllister to Sntter; Sixteenth,
from Valencia to Folsom, and Valencia,
from Market to Twenty-eighth. There is
also a favorable prospect of having Folsom
street soon illuminated with arc lights
from Third to Twelfth, and a large portion
of Mission street.
It will thus be seen that a large portion
of the City will be provided with this im
proved system of lighting, and it is be
lieved that when once the City is thus
properly illuminated the municipality will
continue the excellent work under the au
thority of the City.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1896.
WILL PROTECT
PUBLIC BUILDINGS
Supervisors Asked to Pro
hibit Promiscuous Ex
pectorating.
C. L. Taylor Elected to the Po
sition of Gas and Water
Inspector.
Tax Rebates Will Not Be Paid Until
the 21st Instâ Bateman Bros.'
Bond Approved.
The Board of Health presented two im
portant measures for the consideration of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday.
The first was the long-talked-of order
pronibiting expectorating on the floors ot
public buildings, streetcars and other
places. The second related to throwing
banana peelings and other rubbish on the
floors of public buildings, the sidewalks,
etc. In each case the minimum fine is
set at $5 and the maximum imprisonment
at two days.
Both orders were referred to the Health
and Police Committee.
Supervisor Taylor was elected Gas and
Water Inspector, vice Chris Newman,
term expired, by the votes of Supervisors
Benjamin, Hughes, Dunker, Morgenstern.
Sprecjcels, Hobbs and Wagner. Super
visors King, Scully and Hirsch votea
against the nominee of the Mayor, and
Supervisor Dimond was excused on the
ground that he understood that Colonel
Taylor wns not a candidate for the office.
The Mayor named Taylor Rogers, his
present secretary, for tÂ«ie office, but he
lacked the requisite number of votes and
Mr. Taylor's name was then proposed.
The bond of Bateman Bros., covering
the construction of the Hall of Justice,
was approved.
The City and County Attorney was re
quested to render an opinion on the sub
ject of jurors' lees in criminal cases. The
board accepts the law allowing fees where
actual service is rendered, but desires to
know whether fees must be paid where
the juror merely puts in an appearance
without serving on a jury. Â«
The Superintendent of Streets wad in
structed to at once remove a frame build
ing obstructing Oregon street, between
East and Drumm.
It was decided to extend the time for
the payment of tax rebates until the 2lst
inst. in order to give the Treasurer a
chance to get the necessary blanks ready.

WAS NOT IN CONTEMPT
A. W. Foster Shut Sidney V.
Smith Out of a Directors'
Meeting.
Bat the Trial Court Erred in Its
Finding While the Main Issue
Was on Appeal.
A. W. Foster was not guilty of con
tempt of court when he prevented Sidney
V. Smith from entering a meeting of tne
boar ! of directors of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Railway Company last
March 23. The Supreme Court ascertained
this to be toe fact yesterday, ana annulled
the order of the Superior Court, which
had adjudged Foster to be in contempt.
An annual meeting for directors of the
San Francisco and North Pacific Railway
Company was held in February, 1896.
Certain votes that were offered in favor of
Sidney V. Smith as one of the directors
were rejected by the chairman of the
meeting. At the close of the election
Antoine Borel, J. B. Stetson, Andrew
Markham, A. W. Foster, P. N. Lllienthal,
George A. Newhali and John L. Howard
were declared by the chairman to have
been chosen directors for the year next
ensuing.
Thereafter Smith, with Borel, Stetson
and Howard, filed their application in the
Superior Court of San Francisco under
the provisions of section 315 of the Civil
Code, setting forth their claim that the
votes offered for Smith should have been
counted, and that he instead of Lilienthal
should have been declared elected as one
of the director*.
The Superior Court held that Smith and
not Lilienthal had been elected a director
with the others, und that he was entitled
to exercise the office, and that Lilienthal
should be excluded therefrom. Judgment
was entered March 25, 1896, in accordance
with these findings, and also enjoining
the defendants from interfering with
Smith in the exercise of his office as di
rector.
On the same day that this judgment was
entered, an appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court by tne defendants, and there
after, at a meeting of the directors, Smith
sought to enter the room at which the
meeting was to be held, but was excluded
therefrom by Foster, who had been chosen
the president of the board, and the meet
ing was held without permitting him to be
present.
Justice Harrison finds that the action of
the Superior Court was a proceeding upon
fhe judgment from wbicn the appeal had
been taken and was instituted for the pur
pose ot enforcing a compliance therewith.
The injunction in the judgment against
the interference with Smith's right to act
as a director was but auxiliary to the
judgment determining that he bad such

right, and was merely incidental thereto.
Although preventive in form, it was in ef
fect mandatory, as it required Foster and
the other directors to recognize Smith as
one of their number, and to refuse to recog
nize Lilienthal.
As that portion of the judgment de
claring that Smitn was elected was sus
pended by the appeal, the ir.junctive por
tion, beine merely incidental thereto, was
also suspended, and the power ot the
court to enforce any portion of its judg
ment by inflicting punishment for its
violation was stayed.
An enforcement of tbis portion of the
judgment, Justice Harrison also found,
would operate to carry the decree into
effect, and would change the relative posi
tion of the parties from those existing at
the time the decree was entered, and
might make a reversal of the judgment
entirely ineffectual. If the Superior
Court could indirectly compel the recog
nition of Smith as a director after the de
termination that be had been so elected
had been suspended by appeal, it would
exercise an authority in the pioceedings
after the judgment that it did not possess
while the matter was pending before it
and undetermined.

WHY SHE LOOKED YOUNG.
A Youthful Appearing Woman at Sixty
Years of Age.
"How yonng 3he is at sixty." V
I heard a lady make this remark in tt *
streetcar recently as she pointed out a
fine-looking woman with a bright, healthy
complexion, good figure and brisk step
who had just entered. I also looked at her.
She certainly seemed to be nearer forty
than sixty. 1 recognized her as the wife
of a well-known New York business man,
and knowing that she is always busily
employed, was interested to discover the
cause of her wonderful health and vigor.
Happening to mention the matter to a
lady of my acquaintance shortly after, she
volunteered the lollowing explanation:
"Mrs. T." snesaid, "certainly has splen
did health, and not long ago she tola me
the secret of it. For years past, so she
told me. she has made it a practice to take
a little pure malt stimulant with every
meal. She said that it was owing to this
that she bad escaped the many weak symp
toms and miserable ailments from which
so many women sxiffer. She aays that
whenever she feels tired and worn oat, a
little pure malt gives her new life and
energy."
For the benefit of ladies who may read
these words, I may further adit that I dis
covered, on subsequent inquiry, that ;he
lady aDove referred to uses and strongly
recommends Duffy's pure malt whiskey as
the safest and best of allmalt preparation.-.
No other whiskey is like it, and nothing
can prorinco the same good effects.

A PRISON WALL
A Desperate Criminal's Plan
to Leave the County
Jail.
Long Secretly at Work Though
Constantly Suspected and
Watched.
Soap-Filled Hidden Crevices and a
Surprising Equipment of
. . Crude Tools.
Pat "Kelly, a dangerous and crafty crim
inal charged with burglary and assault to
murder, was apprehended early yesterday
morning in an attempt to dig his way out
of the.County Jail on Broadway.
The jailer suspected from a hint he re
ceived that some move of the kind was to
be made Sunday night. He accordingly
Patrick Kelly, the Desperate Criminal, Whose Curious Tools and Script Operations Were Opportunely
Discovered in the County Jail Yesterday Before He Had Completed His Tunnel to Liberty*
gave orders to the guards not to disturb
any of tbe cells but to stand watch and
permit tne scheme to develop far enough
for the men to be unquestionably impli
cated.
Up* to midnight nothing had occurred to
arouse the suspicions of the alert patrol
men. Then they were relieved by the
"late watch," which coes on duty at that
hour.
Presently, apart from the indistinct
snoring and heavy breathing from scores
of securely fastened cell doors opening
upon the r.omdor, a slight, muffled, grat
ing sound was distinguished by one of tbe
guard?. The noise continued. It seemed
to come from the first cell on the left and
nearest to the front of the building. There
Was no mistaking ide sound; it was the
peculiar erit of stone being dug into by
home harder instrument.
It was in cell 30, ntxt to which is a re
ception-room. In that room one of the
armed guards posted i.imself. Another
on patrol outside the western wall took up
his position immediately opposite that
particular, heavy, screen-barred, narrow
Â«lit that serves as a high ventilating win
dow for tbe cell whence issued the sus
picious sound. It was not likely that the
occupants could complete their work that
night but if ibey should brealc through
tie' masonry there were armed men ready
to receive them.
The guard outside, so near and yet un
observed because of the height of tne
small, screened opening and the thickness
of the wall, could distinguish the sound
of cautious digging. Then, shortly before
dawn, the work ceased and the cell be
came'silent. .
At 8 o'clock yesterday morning cell 30
vas opened by the jailer. There were the
two occupants as usual. There upon the j
floor in each of the back corners were the
two mattresses with their scanty covering
of bedding. On one wall was a small
Bbelf Through tbe high slit streamed a
narrow band of daylight in upon the
faultlessly whitewashed walls. Nothing
was out of order. The boards of the floor
appeared as usual, dark, closely joined
and solid.
KbÂ« mattresses were then drawn asiae
and a mon careful examination was made
of the flooring. A fine line across several
of the boards, all of which run length
wise of the little cell, showed where tney
had been cut by lome delicate instru
ment; but so skillfully bad tbe joints
been rubbed over and filled with soap
that they ware not discernible except to
close scrutiny.
The flooring was immediately pried up
from the crossbeams upon which it rests
only a few inches above tbe earth, down
intQ which tbe partition and outer walls
of the prison are eunk to a considerable
i depth. ..
i Then the whole Â»che roebecame evident
I at a glance, and then tbe cool and calcu
â  Jating Pat Kelly acknowledged the at
tempted iailbreak. though he had before
denied all knowledge of it.
Several small chunks of the stone of the
outer wall had been removed, while space
for them had been made by excavating
earth and throwing it well back under
other parts of the floor. The work bad
not yet progressed very far, though the
jailer thinks that Kelly must have been
engaged upon it for the last six weeks.
The crude tools found in the loose earth
form an interesting feature of the case,
particularly when it is borne in mind that
Pat Kelly has been under the strictest sur
veillance" because of his known reputation
for attempting to break jail. He is the
shrewd head of the notorious trio charged
with burclary and assault to murder who
were apprehended at the City Hall about
three uioiuns ago when trying to escape
â from custody by use of ingeniously made
skeleton keys. *Ou October 15 be, with his
two side partners in crime, was transferred
to the County Jail, which he then openly
boasted could not hold him.
Again and again he has been discovered
in crafty plans to escape from his present
quarters. One was to get up a sham-fight
at night witli his cellmate, and as soon as
the door should bo opened to quell the
disturbance he intended to spring upon
the guard, snatch a pistol, secure the keys
and liberate some of the other prisoners,
among them vis two pals, each confined
in different cells, as he had been, with
some more or less trusty character. As
soon as this scheme oecame known tne
jailer gave orders for the keys to be locked
in the safe at 5 o'clock every night, so that
no cells might be opened. Ou another oc
casion, when the gang had not been at the
jail a week, they were taken up to the City
Hall for trial, and on the way back Cor
bett, one of the trio, succeeded in unlock
ing his handcuffs preparatory 10 making a
bold dash for liberty when the wagon
should be opened in front of the jail.
fortunately instead of the usual two
guards waiting on the sidewalk there hap
pened to be live deputies on hand, and
Kelly's wily mate prudently resnapped
the handcuffs when he taw he had no
chance against so many.
Knowing the propensities of these three
prisoners and tbe shrewdness, coolness
and daring of the leader the officers have
been extremely vigilant. No visitors have
been permitted to see any of them during
t eir two months' residence at the County
Jail.
But yet, under the flooring covered by
Pat Kelly's mattre-s these same vigilant
guards found two caseknives, a long metal
ban tie of a big stewpot and a curiously
improvised opium pipe, redolent with the
fumes that indicated recent use of the for
bidden drug. One of the iron-handled
caseknives had been used aa a tbin
bladed saw and was cut into irregular
teeth, probably by tbe blade of the other
knife.
Ihe opium pipe is certainly a novelty.
The bowl is made of a bit of broom-handle
or a piece of the leg of a chair, a little
basin Deing scooped out for the "dope"
and a channel cut through leading to the
pin-like opening in the middle of the
opium receptacle. ' But the stem is the
most unique part of this bit of every-day
handiwork by a criminal supposed to be
deprived of all tools and the opportunity
to use them. It is made of a piece of
wrapping-paper rolled into the shape of a
small tube. Where it is attached to the
wood the joint is carefully made smoke
tight with plasterings of soap, while the
mouth end is protected from moisture by
a wrapping of tinfoil.
In cell 30, with Pat Kelly, was a John
Kelly, charged with burglary, but uncon
nected with the arch-criminal trio, though
probably, the jailer thicks, a willing or a
compulsory accomplice to the attempted
break.
This Pat Kelly and his partners, Cor bet t
and Gallagher, all of whom have aliases,
are to come up for trial to-morrow for
burglary and assault to murder. The
three are young men, their ages ranging
between about 27 and 30 years. Kelly is
the youngest, as he is the tallest of the lot.
Tbe jailer expressed the opinion yester
day thai Kelly and Corbett are none other
than the notorious and mysterious "tall
man and short man" that stood up so
many persons in this City several years
ago. He says that both are good sailors,
and probably turned their seamanship to
account by shipping from this port every
time the town got too hot for them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 35, 1896.
MISS ELLEN YAW'S
PURE HIGH NOTES
A Successful Concert Given
at the Baldwin Last
Night.
Tq3 Los Angeles Singer Makes
a Very Favorable Im
pression.
Miss Thcrne " Disappoints " at tke
Tivoliâ Pantomime at the
Orpheum.
For the last two years extravagant
notices have been published from time to
time of a new soprano, whose voice was
declared to be more phenomenal than
anything known in the world's history.
This young lady. Miss Ellen Beach Yaw,
was not only declared to have the iuost
marvelous compass, but also to have a
Toice of superhuman beauty, and to be
superlatively fair to the eye with regardto
her own personal oharms.
This hysterical style of puffing generally
begets skepticism, and it would.scarcely be
an exaggeration to say that the greater
part of the audience which nearly filled
the Baldwin Theater last night had assem
bled more out of curiosty than in the ex
pectation of really having an artistic treat.
ThÂ»Â»y were agreeably disappointed, how
ever, for though it would be aosurd to pre
tend that Miss Yaw is all her press
agent's fancy painted her sbe is never
theless a remarkable singer, who startles
by her tours de force as much as she charms
by the grace of her vocalization.
In the lower and middle notes of her
voice, and up, indeed, to about the fifth
line in the treble cleff. Miss Yaw, when
she uses her notes at their normal power,
has absolutely nothing remarkable about
her voice; it sounds an averajre organ of
the light soprano quality, rather sweet,
but showing the deiect of faulty placing
in its throatiness.
When, however, Miss Yaw begins to
sing mezza voce the quality of her voice
changes as if by magic, every note be
comes clear, crystalline ancl exquisitely
sweet, and her execution is a thing of
beauty, for it is as clear-cut and finished
as some minute cameo wrought by a mas
ter hand, every detail of which is perfect.
Her pianos and her pianissimos have
the same grace and sweetness that maiks
the mezza voce, and the notes above the
compass of the average singer were also
sweet, true and delicious in quality. Miss
Yaw did not sing to the full limit of her
advertised compass, but sbe gave some
phenomenally high notes, and they were
pleasan r to listen to.
Miss Yaw is a graceful young woman,
who has the gift of considerable naivete,
as well as of vivacity, and she showed her
goodnature last night by giving a num
ber of encores. "Villanelle," by Dell'
Acqua, was her opening number, and it
showed the graces of her voice admirably.
Her first encore was a "Laughing Song,"
by Auber, which was more difficult than
it appeared from the ease with which the
vocalist rendered it. "Coming Through
the Rye," the second encore, was sung
with ii good deal of pretty expression, and
Miss Yaw made it a vehicle for displaying
! the graces of her voice, by introducing
some difficult cadenzas.
Miss Yaw's second aria was a theme
and variations, by Prach. The singing of
the simple theme showed no remarkable
talent, but the variations again showed
the singer's striking execution.
A Swiss "Echo Song," arranged espe
cially for Miss Yaw, gave her an oppor
tunity of displaying the beautiful tone
colors of which her voice is capable. The
other encores she gave were "Old Ken
tucky Home" and "Protestations," with
violin obligato. After every number Miss
Yaw was received with warm applause.
Maximilian Dick, tbe violinist of the
Yaw Concert Company, played with re
markable sweetness ot tone and delicacy
ana finish. He played a "Ballade" and
"Polonaise" by Vieuxtemps; "Ronde dcs
Lutins" by Bazzini and a "Caprice de
Concert" by Musin, as well as several en
cores, all of which were enthusiastically
received. Miss Georgiella Lay, the pian
iste, played several numbers acceptably,
and accompanied sympathetically.
Miss Yaw's second concert will take
place to-night at the Baldwin. The pro
ceeds will be devoted to the sick children's
fund.
At the Orpheum.
A somewhat unusual act for this City has
been introduced by the Orpheum this week in
the Shape of Joseph Phote's pantomime com
pany. Last night the performance was at the
end of the bill and, consequently, was marred
Dy the noise of a departing audience, but, in
spit 6 of the haste of some spectators to get
out, the pantomime evoked a good deal of
laughter and induced a large portion of the
audience to remain until the curtain dropped.
The Phote act tells how Mephisto falls in love
with an innkeeper's daughter and on being
rejected makes things very uncomfortable for
the guests at the Inn. Pierrot suffers most, the
plates being whisked off his table atd the
clothes oft his bed. Mephisto's lively sprite Is
murdered by the innkeeper and Pierrot, but
when they put tho fragments together the
image suddenly comes to life and does more
mischief than ever. Finally a good fairy
forces Mephisto and his following to with
draw.
Joseph Phote, who played Pierrot, and Mar
tha Phote, who was Mephisto, are accom
plished mimists and acted iheir parts so that
no piogramme was necej^sary. Paul Barrett was
good as the innkeeper anil Hugo Steinback
was an excellent sprite. The rest of the cast
was satislactory. "Mephisto" is a refined as
well as a pretty performance. It would have
been more enjoyed list night if a few of the
big hats had been removed, tor in pantomime
acts the first requisite Is to see, and a vast ma
jority of the audience ouly obtained fleeting
glimpses of the mimists tnrough forests of
flowers and feathers which waved about on
ladies' heads.
One of tne new acts, Sadie Cushman, of the
team of C'ualiuian and Holoombe, showed her
self to bp a charming vocalist of th^Lydia
Yeamans Titus variety, but her sweet bird-like
voice is more powerful than that possessed by
Mrs. Titus. Kaoly Is a clever acrobat. Some
of the best of last week's performers remain
on the bill.
The livoli.
There was a fair audience at the Tivoli
Opera-house to witness the rendition of KaliVs
"Bohemian Girl," which is always^dmired by
all lovers of music. There was a disappoint
ment In the nor-appearance of Belle Thome,
who was to have appeared as Arline. She was
taken suddenly ill yesterday. Her place in
the cast was creditably filled by Catherine
Creig. John J. Raffael \yaÂ» in good voice and
carried out the part of Count Arnheim so well
that he was frequently applauded, and Rhys
Thomas, as the proscribed Pole, wag also grati
fied with bursts of approval of his singing.
It is expected that Miss Xhorne will appear to
night.
Grand Opera-House.
"The Police Patrol" was presented to a large
audience in the Grand Opera-house last night.
The day, which has the merit of a strong and
intelligible plot like all melodramas, abounds
in many sensations and a number of striking
tableaux. There is the murder of a rich uncle
by a scheming rephew, who perpetrates this
crime to conceal a forgery, aud then there is
constant effort on the part of the nephew to
keep out of tiie clutches of the police and a
determined effort on the part of the police to
fix thÂ« murder on the nephew.
There is a good deal oi comedy in the play,
which is rendered to the delight Of the upper
gallery by E. J. Herron and Lottie Williams.
The police patrol scene, with a quick hitch
up, proved a great hit, and was well enacted.
Miss May Capwell made her first appearance,
taking tbe part of a housekeeper, and showed
a good knowledge of stage business. Those in
tha card deserving special mention are How
ard Kyle as Captain Hardy of the police,
Walter Fessler as the nephew. Leslie Morosco
as Artful Jt c, Frank Hatcn as a colored uncle.
Victory BÂ«teman as the dangerous witness
against the nephew and Julia Bianc as a
woman of the world.
Alcazar 1 heater.
There was a large audience at the Alcazar
Theater last ni,'ht to greet the second week of
"Alabama." The performance, which is going
very smoothly and artistically, called forth
frequent and hearty applause.
A lew hours before the curtain went up
Harry Benrimo, who played the part of Deca
tur last weefc, was taken suddenly ill, and
Walter Belasco made a quick study of the col
ored servant's role and was not only letter
perfect but played the part very effectively.
Columbia Theater.
The second week of "The Cotton King"
opened at the Columbia Theater last night to
a fuir-sized house. There were no changes in
tne cast.
HAS LAID HIS PEN ASIDE.
Henry S. Da'.liba, a Pioneer
Journalist, Passes
Away.
Kindness and Absolute Fidelity Were
Characteristics by Which He Will
Be Remembered
H. G. Dalliba, a worthy pioneer news
paper man of San Francisco, died at his
home, 1622 Laguna street, shortly after 4
o'clock yesterday morning. His death was
so cainle.ss that he seemed to pass away
in slumber.
Mr. Dalliba was born in Boston Novem
ber 13. 1835, and came to California in 1850,
arriving here April 2of that year. Mining
engaged his attention for two or three
years and then he turned his thoughts to
journalism. He wrote for the Times and
Mirror first and later became one of the
proprietors of the Democratic Press. When
tbe Examiner was established in 1865 Mr.
Dalliba became its business manager. In
1868 he joined the editorial staff of the
San Francisco Times and wrote for that
paper until it was purchased by the owners
of the Alia California.
In April, 1870, Mr. Dalliba's services as a
writer were secured by the Evening Bulle
tin. His connection with that journal
continued without a break from the date
of his engagement iv 1870 until early in
January, 1895- Much of his work was
done in the higher courts of the law. As
a court reporter he possessed special
qualifications. He was on terms of cor
dial friendship with most of tbe eminent
Judges and lawyers of his time. In
handling law papers he was gifted with
second sight, so to speak.
Ol him it can be truthfully said that
"none knew him but to love him." There
was so much in him that was genuine
and sturdy and kindly that lie had the
confidence of all with whom he came in
contact. Judges confided to him secrets
of decisions before they were made pub
lic He was the soul of sincerity and
frankness. Generous to a fault and loyal
to his family, he accumulated very little
moniy.
Those who knew him intimately during
the last lew years of his life saw the enac
tion of a tragedy of which his lips uttered
no hint. He lost his wife and that broke
his true heart. The Bulletin changed
owners, and it soon became apparent to
him that he "lagged superfluous on the
stage." He lost his position on the Bul
letin, and then came many months in
which he vainly sought situations in other
lines of employment.
This simple-hearted old man never
thought evil because he never intended
evil. His opinion of men whom he had
well known was favorable. When they
made excuses to him, his naturally proud
spirit was 9tung as with whips. Finally
poor health came and his days of useful
ness he sadly found to be over. His children
sustained him with their labor and with
their considerate affection. There is not
a newspaper man in San Francisco who
knew Mr. Dalliba well who will not id
stinctively think of him to-day as "Dall,''
and many will say "Poor Dall," lament
ing the flight; of a brave, sincere and chiv
alrous spirit.
Five daughters and a son survive him.
The funeral services will take place to
morrow at 9:30 a, m. from 1622 Laguna
street, and a requiem mass will be cele
brated at 10 a. M. at St. Mary's Cathedral,
on Van Ness avenue. The interment will
be at Holy Croas Cemetery.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
A LEONINE ROAR
BY JUDGE WALLACE
Disappearance of an Ex
hibit in Yon Tiede
man's Case.
Nobody Is Able to Solve This
Latest Mystery of the Su
perior Court.
Chances of Escape Seem Very Bright
for a Man Who Is Charged
With Parjury.
Judge Wallace's leonine roar was heard
in Department 6 of the Superior Court
yesterday morning when Clerk Salomon
informed him that the photograph of Mrs.
Sarah Owen Spencer was missing from
the papers and exhibits in the case of Carl
yon Tiedeman, indicted for felony, to
wit, perjury. Mr. Salomon said the pic
ture never came into his possession so far
as he knew.
"It is an outrage that anything like this
should happen," said his Honor, and the
bench shook with thunderous denunci
ation.
Yon Tiedeman, the handsomest and
most stylishly dressed man in the room,
appeared to take a philosophical view of
the loss of the picture. If he was sorry he
did not show it by his countenance, but
in his experience as an operator he has
had much experience in controlling his
facial expression, so no one could tell ex
actly what he thought in regard to the
evident disgust and surprise with which
Judge Wallace regarded this invasion of
his court's jurisdiction and archives.
The importance oi the disappearance of
this picture may be judged from the fact
that an attorney in the lobby declared
that it was like the piece de resistance in
a French dinner. Without it the banquet
cannot proceed any more than Hi.mlet
could be played with the Melancholy Dane
omitted.
Briefly stated the position of the ca3e is
as follows: Yon Tiedeman was indicted on
a charge of forging a deed to property De
longiug to Mrs. Harriet P. Chnaty, and
when ne was arrested for that unme he
declared that he was toe victim of a de
signing woman. To establish this he pro
duced in court the photograph of the
woman who, he said, declared herself to
be Mrs. Cnristy.
At once the photograph was identified
as a pic ure of Mrs. Sarah Owen Spencer,
whu had formerly been mixed up in some
forgeries uf deeds, but wno at ihe time of
Yon Tiedeman's trial was not in California.
Yon Tiedeman pretenaed that ne did not
know Mrs. Spencer and said that he had
accepted in good faith her averment that
she was in fact Mrs. Christy.
Believing this statement and conceiving
Yon Tiedeman to be the much-abused vic
tim of untoward circumstances the jury
returned a verdict of acquittal.
Yon Tiedeman was nappy, but Mrs.
Spencer didn't like it, so sue came all the
way from Mew York to prove tuat sne was
not in California at the time Yon Tiedeman
swore that she appeared before a notary
public and made a statement that she was
Mrs. Christy, and that consequently Yon
Tiedeman swore to a lie.
Clerk Salomon's announcement of the
loss vi the picture caused quite a commo
tion. Deputy County Clerk Oscar Tolie
was summoned to tell what he knew of
the mi-s.ng document. He said that alter
tbe trial of Yon Tiedeman in Judge
Belcher's court, all the papers in the case
were delivered to Deputy County Clerk
James Mulcaney. Then Mr. Mulcahey was
asked about ihe matter and could give no
information. He had never seen the pic
ture. Other deputies in the County Clerk's
office were amo questioned, but without
result.
Further efforts are to be made to find
the picture, as District Attorney Barnes
considers it hazardous for the prosecution
to proceed without it. If it is not pro
duced at the trial for perjury it may be
impossible to show that Yon Tiedeman
swore lalsely, and the chances for convic
tion are exceedingly remote.
Mr. Mulcahey testified that the papers
had been handled by a great number of
persons, including attorneys, members of
the Grand Jury, deputies in the office of
the District Attorney and the officers of
Judge Wallace's department of the Su
perior Court. He supposed all the papers
and exhibits were together when he sent
tbe documents in the case to Mr. Salomon.
At 10 o'clock this morning the search
for the vanished photograph will be re
sumed. It migbt be pcs>ible to substitute
a copy were it not for the fact that it was
not a finished portrait, but was simply
what is called a "proof" on thin paper,
and tbe name of the artist was not printed
on it so tnat it could be identified.
County Clerk Curry declared last night
that his office would use every possible
effort to find the picture.
HAY BARN BURNED.
Smith Bros.' "Warehouse on Brannan
Street, With Five Hundred Tons
of Fodder, Destroyed.
Smith Bros.' hay warehouse on Bran
nan street, between Seventh and Eighth,
with its contents, consisting of about 500
tons of Daled hay, was destroyed by fire
last night.
Wben the department arrived on the
scene, in response to the alarm from box
152, turned in about 10:25 o'clock, the
whole structure was ablaze, and fearing a
spread of the flames to tbe neighboring
grain and hay warehouse of J. 1* Vermeil
& Co., on the northwest corner of Seventh
and lirannan streets, a second alarm was
turned in snortly after Chief Sullivan
came on the scene.
The floorman of engine 29, located at
Eleventh and Bryant streets, saw the
blaze before the alarm sounded, and that
engine was playing a stream on the blaz
ing pile when the remainder of the de
partment appeared.
The "battery," into which five ordi
nary streams were concentrated, poured a
flood into the seething mass from Brannan
street, while the single streams were sta
tioned on the other three sides.
Tnere was danger at first that Vermeil's
place would succumb, but by energetic
and well direoted efforts the fire was con
fined to the Smith Eros.' property and a
kmrn belon ing to Vermeil & Co. From
the latter, however, all the horses and
harnesses were removed to a place of
safety.
Tbe total loss is estimated at about
$6000, which is fully covered by insurance.
Tne cause of the fire is not known.
Owing to the peculiar character of the
fire a number of streams were kept play
ing on the embers all night. At midnight
the Cbisf ordered the battery to move for
ward to closer range. The engines were
shut off temporarily while this change of
position was made.
A Japanese Burglar.
Charles Lee, a Japanese, was booked at the
City Prison yesterday by Policeman J. F.
O'Brien on A charge of burglary. Lee used to
be cook ior R. P. Wielaud, 2012 Broadway,
and last Thursday night he entered the house
and stole two overcoats and a water-proof coat.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainiall, of melted snow in Inches and buiidredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln of equal air pressure: iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hurh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accomoanled by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us. ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
Eorth and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK. N. V.. Dec 14.-There was an In

change, but the activity was at the expense of
values. The sales footed up 207.187 shares. The
bears displayed a highly aggressive spirit and were
liberal sellers of the leading specialties n.ht up to
the close. This selling was based on he belief
that Congress will take up the Cuban question in
earnest shortly and that the death of General
Ma po would be made a matter of Investigation.
The selling pressure was most pronounced in the
gas issues, the grangers. General tiectric, Louis

CHICAGO, Ili.. Dec. 14.â The action of the \
wheat market was a surprise this morning. There
was nothing on which to base strength > nd prices
advanced from a lower opening, the rise encoun
tering very little opposition, although the general
trade was bearish. Liverpool quotations were un
changed 10 lower. To accord with our Saturday's
market an advance should have been established.
The -world's shipments were extremely large, ap
proximating 9,800,000 bushels.' The amount on
ocean passage Increased 480,000 bushels. Despite
these statistics, which rather favored lower prioes,
the temper of the market was buoyant. Receipts
at Chicago were 43 cars and 141.796 bushels were
withdrawn from store. The Northwest had 810
cars, against 1048 last Monday and 1323 a year
ago. Closing Paris * cables ' were . higher, Berlin
lower and Antwerp unchanged. Export clearances
amounted to 211,002 bushels- The visible supply
decreased 2,028.000 bushels. This caused good
buying and a further alvance. The English visi
ble supply Increased 1,160.000 bushels. May
wheat opened from 80% cto 80c, advanced to
82% c. closing at the outside, 1 V4(a:lV 4 (a:13 8 c higher
than Saturday. Estimated receipts lor to-morrow
64 cars. No. 2 red, spot -wheat, ranges from 89c
to 9i 1 c, closing about 9iygC.
CORNâ The corn market was almost a nominal
: one, a small attendance and few orders giving the
pit a lorsaken appearance. Natural sympathy
with the speculative tendency of wheat caused a
firm tone 10 prevail. Receipts were If 6 cars. There
were no withdrawals from store. Ihe amount on
ocean passage increased 80,000 bushels. J-xpori
clearances amounted to 347,153 bu<hels. The
visible supply showed an lnc'rea-e of 66,000 bush
els. May corn opened at 25%fi526'?/gc, advauced
to and closed at 26@26%c, 1 /g(<i' l higher than
Saturday. EÂ«timated receipts for to-morrow 375
cars.
OATSâ The first trading in oats was at easy
figures, but: the startling jump in wheat helped the
feeling later. Ihe receipts. 490 cars, overran the
estimate by 40 cars. Withdrawals from store
were 39,3.0 bushels. The visible supply de
creased 938,000 bushels. May oats closed J/ic
higher. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 03ti
cars.

PROVISION.^â A light run of hogs and better
prices at the yards conveyed a firm tone to prod
uct a; the opening. Business was fair. The j
strength of wheat had a good effect on the pro
vision market. May pork close 1 7%c higher,
and May lard and ribs 2%c higher. .
BUTTERâ 'l'ne butter market was weak and
lower to-day. Business was restricted owing to a
light demand. Receipts were heavy. .

A REPUBLICAN
President â¢ Elect McKinley
Has Given Him Per
sonal Assurance.
Senator Thurston's Bill, Vetoed
by Cleveland, Will Soon
B* a Law.
Hs O;d Lieutenant Railton Was Not
X lied, but Is in the Amer
ican Volunteers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Dec. 14. f
General Kelly has no longer any use for
commonwealism, and it will no doubt sur
prise tens of thousands of people to learn
that ho is now a sincere Republican. Dur
ing the past campaign Keily, according to
his own statement, did very effective work
for the McKinley cause in lowa, Nebraska
and Kansas.
Mr. Kelly recently returned to Oakland
and is very much satisfied with the result
<tf his mission. He did not bring about
; Ai amelioration of the condition of tbe
â¢ rking classes in tbe manner which he
l^rposed when he started out, but the de
sired result, he feels confident, will be at
tnined through another channel.
The leader of what was known as the
"Industrial Army" entered into com
munication with Major McKinley several
months ago, and he now asserts thai he
has personal assurances from the Presi
dent-elect that the bills for the appropria
tions for public works which were passed
through the Senate by the efforts of Sen
ator Thurston over the veto of President
Cleveland will become a law as soon as
the new administration can make them
operative.
"I am still of the same opinion reiard
ing the duty of governments to provide
work for uuemployed," said Mr. Kelly,
"but experience has shown me that the
manner in which we attempted to bring
the Government of this country to a Bense
of its duty was not perhaps the most ex
pedient. However, it accomplished a
good purpoÂ»b. It jtave us an opportunity
to show to the country a condition oi
affairs that many were" loath to believe
had an existence, and it also proved a re
markable object lesson to many of the Na
tional lÂ«gislators. I have personal letters
from Major McKinley to the effect that as
soon as practicable he will put into opera
tion laws already passed for the benefit of
the unemployed.
"A little error crept into the story in Thb
Call published a few days ago. It is true
that a man named Railton was killed in a
railroad aocident, and it was reported at
the time that he was one of my supporters
during our campaign in Oakland three
years ago. This is a mistake. The Rail
ton who was with me is now in charge of
the American Volunteer Corps in this
City : . Ido not think there will be another
industrial army for the present."
MAT YET BE A PRIMARY.
The New Plan of Arranging for the
City Convention Will Probably
Be Modified.
iJ OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 14.â Politicians
all parties are discussing the surprise
tha,t was sprung upon them Saturday
night by the City Central Committee.
For such a uni n between two conflicting
elements to have been brought about in
such a quick mannei is something unpre
cedented in Oakland politics.
The consensus of opinion seems to be in
favor of the plan proposed Dy the com
mittee appointed by the City Central
Committee â i. c., to appoint 147 delegates
to the city convention. While this is in
direct conflict with the great fight made
to secure a primary in the Hilborn-Frick
content it is in keeping with the policy
hitnerto followed by the Non- Partisans
since tbey were organize!.
The Enquirer, which is the recognized
organ of the Non-Partisan element in
municipal politics, prints to-night what
will undoubtedly be the way in which the
committee will preserve themselves with
dignity from any charge of inconsistency.
It says:
It has been suggested that there is a way
out of the confusion created by this last act of
the ciiy committee, which is consistent w!th
past declarations, with party principle and
â¢witii the interests of good government. This
is that the twenty-one gentlemen named shall
meet and name 147 persons fit to be delegates;
that they shall then call a primary and submit
these names for approval, giving the voters an
opportunity to vote for any others whom ihey
may prefer. This is & proposition which has
Leon mentioned by a number of prominent
Republicans, which seems to be fair and which
would probably give general satisfaction.
Tlie great point of interest now is re
garding the candidate of the harmonized
Republican party for Mayor. It has been
generally supposed that the Non-Partisans
would present the names either of Coun
cilman Towle or Auditor Snow, ana that
the Republicans would put up either John
LATEST ADDITION TO BLACKSTONE HILL.
OAKLAND, Cjll., Dec. 14.â The foundation has been laid for t&e new borne
â¢ of W. R. Davie at Prospect avenue and Summit street, which is in the center
of the district known as Blackstone Hill, because it is such a favorite spot for
lawyers. The contract was placed on record to-day and called for a beautiful
structure adapted from the Renaissance. Its leading feature will be a colon
nade stretching for fifty feet along the East facade. The house will be of stone
and wood and the concrete work of the superstructure will be in imitation
sandstone. The details include deep gables, ornate towers, with receded win
dows, and everything in the interior is designed for the purpose of making it a
modern, model home. Walter J. Matthews, who planned the Ebell Society
building, is the architect.
Britton or John L. Davie. From conver
sationo with these gentlemen to-day it is
apparent that none of them were aware of
the consolidation plan until after it had
been DUt through, and consequently there
is a suspicion that an entirely new man
may be selected to head the city's govern
ment.
St. John's Congregation.
OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 14â The Rev.
Benjamin Akerly. D.D., rector emeritus
of St. John's Episcopal Church, is con
fined to his bed irom feebleness. The par
tial destruction of the structure yesterday
morning was a great shock and reacted
unfayorably|on|hi3 physical condition. He
is doing as well as could be expected.
Tlie Rev. Michael King, rector of the
! Church of t.e Immaculate Conception,
I just across the street, who has been a
neighbor of the aged divine for ihirty-two
year<, says: "In all of my acquaintance I
have known ot no finer gentleman than
Father Akerly. I am sorry lor them and
offered St. Mary's Hall for the congrega
tion of St. John to worship in until other
plans could be arranged. Ido not know
what arrangements the Rev. Floyd J.
.M.vnard, the rector, has made."
The vestry met this evening and con
' sldered a nurriDerof locations offered for
i moetinK purposes until the future w*s de
cided, bu left the matter in the hands of
the rector. The matter of rebuildinp: wiii
not be considered until the next meeting.

vis, ihe Republican nominee at the recent
| general election for Supervisor from the
First District, has filed a contest against
| Thomas D. Wells, the Fusionist candi
date, who was declared elected by a

I all of the seventeen election boards in the
I district counted and rallied for Wells
| votes which were cast for JarViS, but par
| ticularly in Pleasanton Precinct 2, where
i the election board counted and-the clerks
! tallied twenty-ei^ht votes for Wells
j which were voted for Jarvis, while in
I Pieasanton Precinct 1 seven votes were
â  thus miscounted, and he requests that the

i counted. The hearing has been set for

OAKLAND, Cal.. Dec. 14.â The im

I sue un :er the Vrooman act is being re

I the First Methodist, the Astury Church
I and the Young Men's Christian Associa

tees individually have mostly expressed
themselves in favor of the work under the
Vrooman act.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1896.
TWO RUNAWAY
COUPLES UNITED
A Decoto Belle Weds a
Young Man From the
Big City.
Young Folks From Alameda
Also Take Matters in Their
Own Hands.
Miss Lubbock Informs Her Parents
by Telegrrph That She Is
Married.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 14. |
Alameda County is having more than
her share of runaway matches. Nearly
every day for a week one has been re
ported from some part of the county.
Yesterday there were two.
For a long while Bertha Baker, a belle
of Decoto â and here it may be remarked
that there are so few young ladies in that
section that each one it a belle â has for
some time been violently in love with
Earl Scott, a youth 01 San Francisco.
Mr. Scott's income was no greater in pro
portion to what married people generally
require than was the age of Mies Baker to
that which her father thinks necessary to
enable a girl to become a man's wife.
These two circumstances of finance and
age formed a barrier which the old Decoto
farmer was not willing to break down in
the interest of the young people's affec
tion.
Saturday afternoon Mr. Scott deposited
his $2 with the County Clerk and pur
chased a license to wed Miss Baker. Yes
terday morning he went as usual to pay
his weekly call on bis sweetheart at De
coto, and before he had been there many
hours sue was persuaded that a little trip
to Oakland and a TiMt to a minister would
be a very fitting ending to their courtship.
The old farmer evidently thought other
wise, for when Mr. Scott and Miss Baker
went for a stroll in the afternoon a little
Baker was somehow or other sent along,
either as chaperon or spy, or both. The
young couple walsed to the station, took
the train for Oakland, and the little
brother went home alone.
Mr. Baker has stated that it will be a
long time before he is reconciled to his
daughter's disregard of his wishes, but
Mr. and Mrs. Scott express no fear but
that they will soon be received with the
usual benediction.
The many friends of Miss Blanche
Louise Lubbock, daughter of Assistant
Postmaster Lubbock of Alameda, will be
surprised to learn of her marriage on last
Saturday in Oakland. Miss Lubbock is
one of the best known young ladies of
Alameda. She has been keeping company
with Frank Newton Walton for some
time, and while it was generally supposed
that they would be united in matrimony
sorae day, the event proved a genuine
sensation.
The first intimation that any one had of
the affair was on Saturday evening, when
Mr. Lubbock received a dispatch dated
Oakland, which read:
Blanche and I are married.
Frank Walton.
Theceremony wassolemnized at the resi
dence of the Rev. Alfred Rummer, Oak
land, in the midst of the pastor's family.
Miss Lubback left home early Saturday
afternoon presumably to visit friends, but
instead went direct to Oakland, where she
met Walton. He secured the necessary
licen-e, and they were quietly mar ied.
A letter was received at the bride's home
to-day in which she states that she fully
realizes the step that she has taken and is
happy with her choice.
Mr. and Mrs. Walton returned to Ala
meda this evening at 8 o'clock and went
directly to the parental roof to seek for
giveness.
THE COLLEGE ATTACKED.
Los Angeles Citizens Uaite to
Condemn a State Forestry
Station.
Professor E. W. Hi.gard of Berketey
Says All Privileges Are Granted
1c San a Monicans
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 14.â The pro
fessors of the agricultural department of
the university have rallied to the defense
ot their college against the repeated at
tacks of Los Angeles citizens, which are
believed to be the result of the personal
influence of Abbott Kinney, who has
made many assaults in tbe southern
press.
Resolutions denouncing the regulations
adopted for the care of the forestry sta
tion at Santa Monica have been passed by
tne Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce,
Academy of Sciences and Town Council.
It is declared by these organizations that
the rules in question are overbearing and
exclude the public from a proper use and
enjoyment of the grounds.
Professor Hilgard, head of the agricul
tural department, has received from
Europe copies of the regulations in force
in botanical gardens there, by whioh it is
claimed tue rules denounced by Los An
geles citizens are shown to be much less
strict than is in Europe deemed necessary
for the protection of the botanical speci
men!).
The rules that aroused Ire in Los An
;reles prohibit the gathering of specimen
flowers, fruits, vegetables, seeds, etc., by
visitors, but provide for the securing of
such specimens, by those who desire,
them, through the foreman in charge.
"Tne general public is cordially welcome
at every station and tbe foreman is re
quired to be polite to all visitors, " says
the notice of the regents.
"No person shall touch the plants or
flowers" is the first rule of the Royal
Bo anical Gardens at Edinburgh, copies of
which Professor Hilcard has secured for
the defence of his department.
The rules for the securing of specimens
require that written application to the
keeper be made at least "two clear days
before the date upon which the specimens
are required."
"The strictness at this station goes even
further lh:n this," said Professor Hilgard
"The applications must be made upon
certain prm;eU forms, and those who re
ceive specimens are required to leave the
gardens with them immediately and by a
certain specified gate. As the rules say
'they are not allowed to walk about the
gardens carrying tbe specimens.'
"There are no such rules as these in
connection with our stations, and no rules
at all but such as are necessary to protect
our gardens from promiscuous flower and
specimen gathering."
During Robbery.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 14.â A daring
burglary took place lust night at the resi
dence of J. W. Baldwin on College way
while the family were out at church.
The thief, or thieves, entered the dwel
ling from a side window, which they had
pried open with a pair of shears, and.
alter ransacking every room, made good
their escape, taking with them adiamond
s;udded gold watch, $20 in coin, a loaded
revolver and an umbrella. Though it
was a stormy night the housebreakers
left the umbrella in a neighboring yard.
Tbe family were away from 7:30 to 9
o'clock at service, and upon returning they
lound that their house had been lpoted.
An aged grandfather who returned be
fore the rest of the family, found that
some one was in the house upon his arri
val, but thought that it was a relative, and
consequently did not make an investiga
tion. It developed later that the person
whom he had heard was the robber grop
ing about in the darkness.

MRS. DANIEL'S DIVORCE.
Tells How a Champagne Bill Broke Up
Her Home.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 14.â Mrs. C. G.
Daniel, formerly of 688 Thirty-third street,
was granted a divorce by Judge Seawell of
San Francisco yesterday from C. G.
Daniel on statutory grounds.
Mrs. Daniel stated yesterday that sbe
had long hesitated, but the time had come
to speak out. She says she moved over to
Oakland in November, 1895, and was
troubled by a woman who returned her
kindness by treacherously practicing her
wiles on her husband. Mr. Daniel denied
any guilt. From February until June,
Mrs. Daniel says, there were champagne
suppers and clandestine meetings at
hotels till a champagne bill came to the
house, and then the husband admitted his
fault.
Mrs. Daniel charges this woman with
inducing Mr. Daniel to leave his wife, he
alleging that he was going back to Scot
land. The real plan, she says, was for
the two to elope together, A ticket as far
as Los Angeles was bought, and from the
cars Mr. Daniel waved "Good-by, sweet
heart," to his wife, left on the platform.
Mr. Daniel only went to Port Costa,
according to his former wife. He came
back to this city, met his lo^e, went to a
swell restaurant and thence to Vichy
Springs. The pair parted after two weeks,
and Mr. Daniel wired to his wife from Los
Angeles, and she went there, but failed to
induce him to return. He finally came to
Oakland, but refused to confess for some
time.
Then tbe champagne bill came in and
the truth came out. Mr. and Mrs. Daniel
separated about the middle of Jnly, but at
a subsequent meeting the husband made a
full confession, placing the whole blame
upon his companion.
Mrs. Daniel wishes to deny that she has
ever attempted to evade certain debts cr
that sbe condoned her husband's faults
after proof was obtained. She says that
she will endeavor to make her livelihood
and liquidate all her obligations.

A Liverraore School-Teacher Again
Charged With Insanity.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 14 âMiss Mary
Jane Colehan of Livermore will be exam
ined as to her sanity before Judge Frick
to-morrow at 10:30 o'clock. The charge is
preferred by Mr. Koss of the Wilson
House, who says she suddenly claimed to
own the bouse and attempted to take pos
session without consulting him.
Theyounj? woman was arrested along
with her sister, Miss Catherine, August
14, 1895, on complaint of their brother.
They were school-teachers residing in
Livermore and declared that their brother
was making an attempt to get rid of them
so that he could secure all of the property
left by their father. The case excited con
siderable comment at the time and Mary
demanded a jury.
Judge Greene pranted the request and
the inquiry occupied several days. She
was set free. Her sister, however, was
committed to the Agnews Asylum after
an inquiry held before Judge Greene.

PROPOSED NORTH
SIDE BOULEVARD
The Old Section of the
City Claims Timely
Recognition.
Montgomery Avenue to Have
an Outlet Toward the
Beach-
The Two Avenues Will Be Brought
Into Direct Connection On?
With the Oth-r.
The spirit of improvement is spreading,
and sections of the City that for years
have lain dormant are beginning to feel
the march of progress and to stir them
selves, so they may join before the proces
sion has passed them.
Montgomery avenue is the latest to start
in the direction of lights overhead and a
good pavement beneath. Montgomery
avenue is the great artery that connects
the old-time business section with the old
time residence section at North Beach, and
for years the quarter that it passes through
has stood still, while progress went to
tbe south and west. Now, however, the
property-owners have determined to make
the historic old street a boulevard, an at
tractive way to the northern and north
eastern portions of the City, and not allow
it to remain the sleepy thoroughfare it has
been since tbe early days.
The plan at present is to lead the prog
ress of light and good pavement from
Kearny street into Montgomery avenue,
out the avenue to Bay street, and along
Bay street to where it reaches Van Ness
avenue. When the big demonstration of
the Kearny-street property-owners takes
piace next Saturday night the Montgom
ery-avenue people will join. One will cele
brate work nearly finished, the other will
celebrate work about to be commenced.
It is the intention to have arc lights put
in as far as Vallejo street as a start and
out at the northern end. The blocks on
Bay street that separate Montgomery ave
nue froro Van Ness avenue will be graded
and well paved.
This much-desired improvement was
flbroposeb Dortb Sibe Boulevard.
â ought to be commenced six months ago,
but the opposition of Thomas Brown of
the California Bank, who owns property
on that street, prevented the work at that
time, under the impression that the pro
posed street work was the scheme of some
contractors. But since then the benefits
to be derived by the proposed wort had
been pointed out to him and he now fa
vors the improvement, as it will be the
means of opening up a new line of travel
from the business renter of the City to
that portion of ban F.ancisoo lying north
of Montgomery avenue and Pacific street
to the Presidio, known as Pacific Heights.
Through the effort of the Van Ness
avenue Improvement Club seven blocks
on that boulevard are now being laid with
bitumen, reaching as far north as Bay
street.
Lombard street, which is fourteen blocks
on a direct line from Van Ness avenue to
the Presidio, will be a favorite drive when
brought into line by the contemplated im
provement â¢
This proposed boulevard will give direct
access to the principal hotels, and when
strangers are visiting San Francisco they
will have a pleasant drive through the
Presidio to First avenue, and then to Gol
den Gate Park, returning home by way of
Golden Gate avenue, thus making a circuit
of the city without the inconvenience of
being rocked half to death by driving over
rough cobbleÂ°.
Getting Bay street into line will be very
easy, as nothing more difficult than the
removal of sand lies in the way.
It is the wish of Edward Holland of the
Commercial Hotel, Dr. H. Morton and A.
Jacobs, who are leading in the movement,
to have the present Board of Supervisors
order the necessary work doneDeforpit
retires from office.
The " WeinaohtÂ«markt. "
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 14.â The mem
bers of the Verein Germania are preparing
to celebrate the holidays with a "Wei
nachtsmarkt." It will be held in the club
rooms on i/incoln street, Sunday after
noon and evening, December 27. The

BLYTHE CASE AGAIN.
Florence Hinckley's lawyer! Want It
Barred From the United States
Circuit Court.
Some time ago John W. Blythe and
Henry T. Blythe, claimants of the estate
of the late Thonia-* H. Blythe, began an
action in the United States Circuit Court
against Florence Blythe Hinckley and
Frederick W. Hinckley to quiet title 10
the property held by the latter on a judg
ment of the Superior Court, confirmed by
the Supreme Court of California. These
claimants, like all of the others in the
notable contest for tne dead millionaire's
estate, had their day in court when the
case was iv tha State courts.
Their effort to throw the case into the
Federal court was based upon their claim
that they were not residents of the United
State 3 and therefore the final judgment
upon the ownership of the property could
be made only by a Federal judge. Their
action on trie lines mentioned, to quiet
title, completely ignored the Blytho-
Hinckley people and treated of them as
though they were usurpers of tne rights
and belongings of the plaintiffsâ John W.
and Henry T. Blythe.
Tuis suit threatened to bring up the en
tire case before the courts again. The idea
of reopening the litigation was Jdecidedly
offensive to the attorneys for the present
possessors of the-Blythe estate, ami yes
terday W. H. H. Hart filed in the Unitad
States Circuit Court a plea to have the
amended complaintof John W. and Henry
T. Blythe dismissed. In the plea the at
torney reviews the case from beginning to
end and dwells with particular emphasis
upon the decree and judgment and the
final order for distribution by the State
courts, and in conclusion says:
All of which matters and things these de
fendants aver to be true, and they plead tbe
same to the amended bill of complaint herein
of said plaintiffs and in bar thereof; and
these defendauts pray the Judgment of this
honorable court whether they ought to be com
pelled to make any answer to said amended
bill of complaint and humbly pray that plain
tiff's bill of complaint be dismissed and that
these defendauts be hence dismissed with
their reasonable costs in. this behalf most
wrongfully sustained.
Should the Judge of the United States
Circuit Court decide to grant the prayer
of the petitioners and dismiss the other
suit the case will be settled forever.
Should be, however, decline to grant their
prayer the case may be reopened and
tried again from beginning to tbe end.
MRS. BAKER'S SUIT.
Her Application for a > ew Trial Denied
by Judge Bunt.
Judge Hunt handed down a decision
yesterday denying the application for a
new triai in the case of Mrs. Susie Baker
against the Board of Education of San
Francisco.
Mrs Baker was a teacher in the Crocker
Grammar School for some time, and in
1893 was dismissed from her position,
whereupon she sued for $1051 and asked
for a mandate of court requiring the Board
of Education to reinstate her in her place
as teacner.
On the trial Judge Hunt found the facts
to be that Mrs. Baker was elected as a pro
bationary teacher for the term of six
months, and that at the end of said term
she was not dismissed, but was allowed to
continue teaching until December 14,
1894, when she was dismissed by the
board.
The position taken by the plaintiff, that
when she was permitted to teach after the
period of her probation had expired
flbe was thereby made a regular teacher in
the School Department, was negatived,
the court declaring that the plaintiff was'
never elected a? a regular it acher, and
therefore might be dismissed at will with
out a trial.
Judgment was therefore given against
Mrs. Baker and sho was ordered to pay the
costs of court.
The Hudelson Libel.
The hearing of the criminal libel suit
against Benjamin F. Hudelson was continued
before Judge Campbell yesterday afternoon.
The whole afternoon was almost entirely
taken up by arguments of counsel as to
whether the statement submitted to the ju
diciary board of the American Protective As
sociation in June last, upon which the charge
of libel was based by Woodvrorth, was a priv
ileged communication. The Judge continued
the case umil Saturday morning, when he will
give bis decision. He intimated that he was
Inclined to dismiss the case on that ground.
Attempted Suicide.
Ida March, a waitress in a dive at 523 Jack
son street, attempted to commit suicide last
night in her room in the Tremont House,
Kearny street. She was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital and will recover. She had been
living with John Green, a gambk-r, but he got
tired of her and left her. This maae her de
spondent. So last night she swallowed some
tincture of iodine, and as it did not have any
effect ui>on her she swallowed a dose of mor

TO FIGHT THE
FUNDING BILL
Committee of Fifty Will
Send a Delegate to
Washington.
A Meeting to Take Preliminary
Steps Was Held Here
Yesterday.
Mayor Sutro Says the Battle Must Be
a Determined One â Commit
tees Appomted.
The committee of fifty, which has in
charge the fight against tbe funding bill
which C. P. Huntin/eton is understood to
be pushing at Washington with all his en
ergy, decided yesterday to send a repre
sentative to the National capital to make
a personal battle against the measure.
The committee met in Mayor Sutro's
office at the City Hall, the following mem
bers being present: Geoige K. Fitch, Jo
seph Leggett, J. D. Phelan, H. E. High
ton, George W. Monteith, William Coward,
Max Popper, J. Taylor Rogers and James
H. Barry.
Charles M. Shortridge, William M.
Bunker, Frank Sullivan, J. C. Jordan and
I. J. Trnman sent letters expressing their
regrets at being unable to attend.
Mayor Sutro spoke at length on the ne
cessity of making an immediate and de
termined fight against the passage of the
bill which would make slaves of the peo
ple of California aa long as it was in force.
"It is evident that Huntinuton and his
hirelings intend to make a desperate
fight to pass the nefarious measure at this
session of Congress," said the Mayor in
conclusion, "and it. behooves the people
of California and the whole country to
present a statement of the matter to Con
gress that will block his schemes and send
tne outrageous measure on to the shelf
forever. Now is the time to fight, and we
must present such a front that even the
octopus cannot break through our lines."
George W. Monteitli spoke of the fact
that Senator Perkins had recently ex
pressed a belief that the funding bill
would pass at this session of Congress.
He thought that Senator Perkins should
be questioned as to the basis of his belief,
and that information valuable to those
opposed to the measure could be thus
gained.
He said that he was convinced that an
earnest fight would beat the bill, and that
the California delegation would be able to
lead the ami-funding members to victory.
On motion of Mayor-elect J. D. Phelan
it was decided to revise the old committee
on memorial to Congress and to appoint
John T. Doyle as chairman.
It was also decided to appoint a commit
tee of three to wait upon Senator White
and discuss plans for the tight against the
funding Dill. Mayor Sutro selected for the
committee J. D. Phelan, J. H. Barry and
George K. Fitch.
On motion of Mr. Monteith tbe same
committee was empowered to select the
representative who will go to Washington
and to collect the necessary funds to de
fray bis expenses while there.

THREW SHIELDS
AND RAN AWAY
Scotch Rose, Favorite for
the Stake, Was Then
Excused.
After This Accident Arrezzo
Won Driving From Sen
ator Morgan.
Lucky Dog Likei the Mnddy Going.
With Joe Terry Left, All Over
Had a Cake-Walk.
A large crowd attended the reopening
day at Oakland track and between watch
ing Scotch Rose, favorite for the stake
event, throw her rider and run away, an
other pronounced choice left at the post
and a weary, tedious wait for a boat at
the conclusion of the sport, the majority
of them felt ill-tempered enough to go
into the Darachule-jumping business or
join the Cuban service by the time they
again readied the Frisco side, long after
dinnertime.
The track on the ether side was favored
witn a cloudy sky and a muddy track for
its reception day. Six well-filled events
were down for decision and seventeen lay
ers of odds cut in. Withal, things drag
gled along and the bookies complained of
a light play. The favorites succeeded in
carrying away four of the purses hune up.
Mr. Ferguson started in well with
his gate work, but it grew a trifle freckled
and lumpy before he got through. When
he left Joe Terry and Articus standing at
the post in the last event a big crowd con
gregated around the judges' stand after
All Over had romped in, and intermingled
with hisses were loud cries that bets be
declared off. This, of course, was an im
possibility.
The special feature of the card was the
Produce Exchange stake for two-year
old at five and a half furlongs worth $950
to the winner and it resulted most disap
pointingly. A. Â£. Leigh's good colt
Arrezzo with 121 pounds, ridden by J.
Gardner, earned off the laurels in a drive
irom Benator Morgan with the others
straggling in. Scotch Rose ruled a 3to 2
choice with Racina a strongly played sec
ond. The others, a very ordinary lot, bar
ring Arrezzo, were almost friendless.
At the post Arrezzo, Hanetta and the
favorite were all fretful, delaying the start.
Thinking at one time Ferguson was going
to pull the lever Shields on Scotch Rose
came with a rush and was rudely jerked
from his saddle by the webbing. The filly
then made a circuit of the track once and
a half riderless. The filly was then
allowed to be drawn, the field was recalled
and twenty minutes allowed for a new
book. After this Racina was made an 11
to 10 choice, but failed to get a mark.
Pulling out of the bunch after being
straightened away in the stretch, Gard
ner Drought Arrezzo in winner by three
parts of a length from Senator Morgan, a
10 to 1 shot. Hanetta, with Patsy Free
man up, was a fair third. The winner
went to the post at odds of 4 to 1.
The opening six-furlone tun went to the
1 to 2 favorite Good Times, who won driv
ing, a length before Flashlight. The lat
ter horse, with Thorpe ud, made a bold
bid for the money.
With Jones up, Shield Bearer ran an^
improved race over his last attempt. He
was a 2 to 1 choice for the race following
over six and a half furlongs, and in a ddve
succeeded in downing Sclmilz half a
length. Charles A was a close third.
There were only three starters in the
mile run, and, ruling a 4 to 5 favorite,
Mount McGregor II led throughout, down
in- Sir Play nandily at the end. Rey del
iJandidos was i. eaten off.
The win o: Lucky Dog in the fifth event,
another six and a half iurlong affair, was
also of the processional order. The big
Dare bin horse was a 9 to 10 favorite and
led his field from trie jump, scoring with
the utiiio-t ease. Mai r Cook was second,
ten lengths ahead of Jim Bczeraan.
With the 7to 5 favorite Joe Terry, and
Articus, another well-played one left
standing at the post, there was nothing
to the mile and a furlong run but All
Over. Shields got a flying start and be
won all the way under double wraps, win
ning in puliing-up fashion from Red
Glenn.
Notes and Entries.
Orannan was reported to have made
quite a "killing"' over the win of All Over.
B <fc W was scratched from the stake
race on account of sickness.
L. W. Legg, who has been East for some
months gathering together sume runners,
was at the track yesterday for the first
time this season. Mr. Legg has entered
in stakes Ferryman 11, Frank Jaubert,
Lew Hopper and others.
Shields was fined $100 and restricted to
riding for his own stable the next thirty
days for attemptinc to heat the gate with
Scotch Rose. The judges also state they
were getting very tired of the young man's
pranKs at the post.

SAMUEL M. SHORTRIDGE IS
APPOINTED AS EXECUTOR
The Heirs and All Interested Parties Unite in Urging
the Court to Appoint Him to Serve
Without Bonds.
MRS. ALLEN'S WILL GOES
TO PROBATE.
Witnesses Say They Are Well
Pleased With the Conduct
of the Trust.
THE BLACKLEG "IXAMINER"
FULLY ANSWERED.
This Case Would Cover It With Con
fusion if It Knew Any Shame.
Only One of Money.
Samuel M. Shortridge was yesterday
confirmed as executor, without bonds, of
the last will and testament of Mrs. Marion
M. Allen, deceased.
The daughters, their hnsbauds, and all
the parlies in interest were present in
court at San Raiael at the time and united
in urging Judge Angelotti to admit the
will to probate and to confirm the ap
pointment of Mt. Shortridge, without
bonds, as stipulated by the will. And the
court did so, saying at the same time that
it was his pleasure to do so.
And this is the case that the Examiner,
day after day, for weeks past has been
making use of in its cowardly attempt to
do harm to the fortune and good name of
Samuel M. Shortridge. This is the case
that has made the subject for its almost
dai<y cartoon.
ThiÃis the casein which by innuendo and
indirection, the weapons of the coward and
blackmailer in newspaperdom, it has
sought to 'make it appear to the public
that a reputable lawyer and private citi
zen, against whom no voice had been
raised save its own, had been unfaith
ful to a trust. This is the case
that has served as one recent text
for that outrageous misuse of its
power by a blackleg press of which
the Examiner is so constantly guilty, and
to which any man, however secure he may
feel himself in his own sense of rectitude
and the trust of good citizens, is still ever
liable merely through giving offense to
some of its petty hirelings.
Gathered in the little courthouse at San
Rafael yesterday afternoon was, as
stated, every person interested in tne will
of Mrs. Allen save one â and this one, a
daughter unable to rise from a sick bed,
was represented by her husband â and
all of them testified to the perfect regu
larity of all the proceedings preliminary
to the probate, and urged the Judge to
carry out the wishes of the deceased, and
anpoint Mr. Shortridge as executor with
out bonds. The whole proceedings con
sumed less than an hour, there being no
intimation of a contest, the court admit
ting the will to probate with the executor
as named.
Those present were: Mrs. Ada Romer
Shawhan' daughter of the deceased and
wife of J. M. Shawhan; Mrs. Edythe Ro
mer Hodces, daughter of the deceased and
wife of Walter M. Hodges, the actor, now
with the Katie Putnam company; Dr.
Walter R. Shoaff, representing by power
of attorney his wife. Cora Romer Shoaff,
trie third daughter of Mrs. Allen. Mr.
Sbawhan and Dr. Shoaff were also pres
ent The only other interested party was
Marion Richards, daugter of Dr. Richards
and granddaughter of Mrs. Allen. She
was represented by Mr. Humphries of
Bishop & Wheeler.
The will had been filed previously
with the court of Marin County
and came up yesterday on the
petition for its probate, It had been the
wish of Mr. Shortridee as well as the heirs
that all the persons interested might be
in court in person upon the hearing of the
petition, and Mrs. Shoaff and Dr. Martin
being taken ill the case was postponed two
or three times that they might be given
that opportunity. Yesterday, however,
the case went on in spite of the fact that
MrÃ. Shoaf was still ill, she giving power
of attorney to her husband to represent
her.
Dr. George H. Martin, a well-known
physician who had lor several years been
in attendance upon Mrs. Allen and who
was one of the witnesses to the execution
of her will, was in court. He was the first
witness called. Quite a number of per
sons had assembled in the little courtroom
at the time, and listened to the proceed
ings with considerable interest.
Dr. Martin stated that he had attended
Mrs. Allen for some two years previous to
the making of the will. He bad been
asked again and again by Mr. Sbortridge,
he said, beiore the execution of the docu
ment, whether the lady was of sound
mind and competent. Afterward he had
taken him (the witness) into the presence
of the others who were in the room, and
again asked him the same question, to
which Dr. Martin gave the same reply.
Mrs. Allen lay at the point of death, he
said, in her room in the Hotel Langham.
Two of her daughters, their Husbands, a
nurse, Miss Eckhardt, Mr. Shortridge and
the witness were present. The doctor
gave a graphic description of the
scene. He said that Mr. Shortridge read
the will to Mrs, Allen, who lay in her bed
propped up by pillows. Having con
cluded, the lawyer asked her distinctly if
what s!>e had heard was her last will and
ttstament and by a nod of the head she
gave assent tbat it was.
The court asked the witness as to the
condition of his mind at the time, and
the* witness replied that there was no
doubt that it was perfectly sound. Mr.
Shortridge, he reoeated, aske l him at
that time very particularly as to this
point. Being assured by him, the law
yer had then asked Mrs. Allen if
he (Mr. Shortridge) should sign

her name to it. She again gave
the nod of assent The nurse then put
her in position so that she could make her
mark. Mr. Shortridge got a large book
from a small table at the foot of the bed,
put the document upon it and held it be
fore the sick woman on the bed, at the
same time giving her a pen, and she there
upon made a cross.
This was all done, he said, in the pres
ence of the subscribing witnesses, her two
sons-in-law. They signed as witnesses to
the mark and as witnesses to the will im
mediately after and in her presence.
Before doing so, however. Mr. Short
ridse, said the witness, asked Mrs Allen
if it was her wish that they should so
sign, both as to the cross, her mark, and
as to the will, and in each instance she
gave the sign of assent as before.
"Then there is no doubt in your mind
as to her competency to make a will and
to express dissent and assent?" inquired
the court.
"None whatever."
Dr. Walter R. Shoaff, son-in-law of the
decaesed and one of the witnesses to the
will, was the next witness. He explained
that his wife was unable to attend because
of illness.
"There have been two continuances on
this account and no other?" asked Mr.
Shortridge.
"Yes," said the witness.
The witness stated that he had stood at
the foot of the bed on the occasion of the
reading of the will to Mrs. AMen by Mr.
Shortridge, and beard it all and saw Mrs.
Allen give assent to it as being her last
will. He described the locations about
the room, aad how the persons present
were disposed so as to see and hear.
"When all were present did you hear
Mr. Shortridge ask if this was the last
will?" asked the court.
"Yes, sir."
"And you saw Mrs. Mien give assent by
a nod?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you hear Mr. Shortridge ask the
lady if she wished you and Dr. Shawhan
to sign as witnesses?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you hear Mr. Shortridge ask if he
should write his name?"
"Yes, sir."
The witness explained fully how their
names were signed in full view of Mrs.
Alien and all present, also how she made
her mark as described by the previous wit
ness, and how Mr. Shortridge had asked
Dr. Martin in ttie hearing of all of them
whether the sick woman was perfectly
competent, and the doctor's answer that
she was.
Mrs. AdaÃ. Shawhan, eldestdaughterof
Mrs. Alien, next took the stand. She re
memoered tne occasion of the execution
of the will, she said, it tooK place in the
Langham Hotel, June 11, 1894. She named
all those who were present and gave a
description in a general way of what took
place, but she said she was overwhelmed
with grief at the time and did not have
that clear impression of details that some
of the others had. She heard Mr. Short
ridge ask the question, however, of her
mother as to whether the document they
were preparing to sign was her last will
and testament.
At this point Mr. Shortridge himself
asked leave of the court to make a state
f ment. The court assentine, Mr. Short
ridge said: "While in point of law it is
not necessary, in my judgment, I desire
to explain or state some of the circum
stances surrounding the execution of Mrs.
Alien's will.
"The body of this document is in my
handwriting. I wrote it at the request and
by the direction of Mrs. Allen. On the night
in question testified to by the witnesses,
the things took place which they have
stated did take pJacs. I did read this
document, which was prepared at the re
quest of Mrs. Allen, as I stated, and I
read it over to her slowly and
Carefully, and naving done so, I
asked her if it was her last will and testa
ment, and if she wished to declare it such,
and she assented to it in the manner
testified to by the witnesses, and par
ticularly Dr. Martin, namely, by the nod
of the bead, which indicated assent.
I then asked her if I should write her
name, knowing her physical weakness.
To this she assented. She then made
her mark. I asked her if she desired that
Dr. Shoaff and Mr. Shawhan should sign
as witnesses, and she assented in the same
manner substantially as testified. Miss
Eckhardt was there, assisting in propping
the lady up in the bed by pillows. I then
took from a little sideboard or piece of
furniture standing against the wall at the
foot of the b d some sort of a book. I
i do not recall what it was, but think it was
J a sort of pictorial book, rather large in
size and not very thick, and Handing
by the bedside facing toward the
lady [indicating] and holding this
paper and the book in this manner, the
pen, as 1 recollect it, was brought by Miss
Eckhardt, Mrs. Aliens arm was put upon
the book so that it rested in that position
[showing]. The pen was placed in her
I hand, and she made a cross, which is there.
I saw it made. I then wrote these words,
'Marion M. Allen' and 'Her mark,' which
your Honor sees. To all the questions
propounded to her she answered in sub
i stance and in the manner testified to. and
I the gentlemen who have testified as doing
so signed this instrument as witnesses in
her presence, on a little table to the right
and a little back of the footboard of the
bed.
"This document was executed in June,
1894, and Mrs. Allen died in October, 1896.
At her request I placed the document in
my safe and vault in the Mills building,
where my offices then were, and there
after in the Crocker building, where it re
mained inclosed in an envelope, stamped
and sealed with her own seal. The will
so remained until her death and the
proper time to open it and hie it for pro
bate.
"At the time of the execution of this
instrument I asked Dr. Martin in the
Langham Hotel whether he thought the
lady was competent to make a will, and
he answered, as he testified, that she was.
"I drew that instrument according to
directions given me by Mrs. Allen, and I
particularly wish to state that my name
was set down in that document as the exec
utor thereof at the request of Mrs. Allen.ex
pressed to me on many and many occa
sions long prior. I had on different occa
sions suggested to her the propriety and
the wisdom of her making a will. Upon
all occasions when she would bring up the
subject she said she desired me to act as
executor, for the protection of her chil
dren."
The courtâ You were Mrs. Allen's adviser
until the time of her death? A.â Yes. sir.
Q,â And this was the last document? Aâ Yes,
sir. I believe the children have matedâ if not,
it can be statedâ that they have made ailigent
search to ascertain whether she left any other
will. The children can testify to that.
Q â Was there any mention made of this will
subsequently by her? A.â l think on one or
two occasions she spoke of it incidentally. I
replied th*t the will was in the safe.
Qâ As 1 understand, Mrs. Shawhan and MrÂ».
Hodges are not present? A.â Mr*. Hodges is
here and I will put her on the stand.
Q.â You say there are three children surviv
ing? A.â Yes, sir.
Q.â Aad there was also a deceased child? A â
Yes, sir.
Dr. Shoaff was recalled and testified as
to there having been a search made tor
any other or later wijl, but without suc
cess.
Mrs. Edith Hodges, a daughter of Mrs.
Allen, recently from Portland, testified
that she was not present at the time of the
execution of ti.e will. In answer to a
question she declared that she was per

fectly satisfied with regard to the appoint
ment of the executor as provided by the
will itself, in the person of Mr. Short
ridge, and said she had gone so far as to
telegraph the court requesting that he
be appointed.
James M. Shawhan was called. He
testified that he had heard Dr. Martin's
testimony and that of othaÂ»s and that he
agreed with all that hart been said; he
had testified previously himself. He knew
that a search had been made and no other
wills found.
At this point W. P. Humphreys, repre
senting Dr. Richards and his daughter,
granddaughter of Mrs. Allen, addressed
the court, saying :
Your Honor, on behalf of Martin Rich
ards, one of the heirs at law, and a grand
child of the deceased, I wish to express here
my satisfaction with the proceedings so far,
and I unite with the others in expressing sat
isfaction aa to Mr. Shortridge acting: as exe
cutor of the last will and testament of Mrs.
Allen.
The Courtâ There has been no opposition to
his acting as such, has there?
Mr. Humphreys â Xo, sir.
The courtâ The only reason that I desired
this testimony was to have, as far as pos
sible, the testimony of all the persons
who were present at the time of the
signing ol this purported will, in view of
the fact that Mr. shawhan, one of the
subscribing witnesses, has testified that he
did not remember seeing any expression of
assent on the part of Mrs. Allen, either to the
declaration ot her will or to the request tbat
they should sign as witnesses. He did not,
however, testify that such assent was not
given. He simply testified that he did not
see it.
The testimony of Dr. ShoaS is quite positive
on the proposition, as is also the testimony of
Dr. Martin. I see uo reason to doubt, in view
of the testimony that has been given here,
thai Mrs. Allen was perfectly conscious of all
that was done at that time, and that it was
done by ber request and with her consent, and
that the document in probate is herlasrwill and
testament. In accordance with the provision
therein that Mr. Shortridge be appointed ex
ecutor â and there is also a request thÃt no
bonds be required of the executor, as suchâ
and in view of the fact that no one interested
in the estate opposes the appointment, Mr.
Shortridge will be appointed as executor with
out bonds.
Mr. Shortridgeâ lf your Honor please, you
will indulge me for a moment, touching mat- j
ters which will naturally and properly now j
come up. I will ask your Honor to name
throe appraisers of the estate. Your Honor
will take suggestions from the heirs or exer
cise your own choice in tbe matter, if it is
agreeable to all parties.
The estate consists of property, all located in
San Francisco. There is a mortgage on land in
the S'.ate of Washington, it is proper now
to bring the matter up touching the
value of the estate, in order that
your Honor can give the proper order
as to the notice to creditors, as well as the ap
pointment of appraisers. I will ask your
Honor to indulge me one moment while I lay
before the court proof upon which you cau
base your order. The petition states, your
Honor will observe, that the estate Is of a
value exceeding $10,000.
The courtâ Why is it necessary to go into
that at this time? A notice will have to be
given of ten months.
Mr. Shortridgeâ For this reason: One of the
notes referred to is of that amount, $10,000.
Whether it Is worth its face value or not is a
matter of proof. I will state, however, that
the petition avers that the property in ques
tion exceeds $10,000. In point of truth, I
suppose, fairly estimated, it would be in the
neighborhood of $20,000. There is a note of
$10,000 which was loaned on property in the
State oi Washington, on which some interest
is due.
The Courtâ On the question of the note there
will hare to be ten months' notice, and the
executor will be safe in giving thai notice.
Mr. Shortridgeâ lt is only a question of sat
isfying your Honor. I had intended on
this occasion to make reply to certain
assaults that have been made upon
me, and made upon me as an
officer of this court, in and about a case or
proceeding then and now pending. Rut it is
enough to know, perhaps, that the three chil
dren, the three daughters of the deceased
mother, are and have been agreeable to the
order wnicb your Honor has made, and that
the granddaughter, who has been represented
by her father, has expressed a preference in
the same way.
The courtâ l think I prefer not to hear that
matter. Yon can reply to that in another
way. This matter is disposed of. I will state
in regard to the appraisers that I prefer to
appoint such as would be satisfactory to the
heirs.
An<i so it appears that Mr. Shortridge is
the choice of the heirs of the Allen estate,
despite the lying reports tfiat have been
persistently circulated by the Examiner.
He is asked to serve and no bonds are re
g uired, and the attempt to prove that
trtere was trouble between him and the
heirs is found to be only another o! "those
Examiner fakes."

II uiu l. ol.it Timber Land Cases.
United States Circuit Judge McKenna
yesterday denied the motion to dismiss
the important Humboldt County timber
land cases. The motion was made by the
defendants, the American Lumber Com
pany and the Central Trust Company.
The latter contended that the cases should
be tried in Illinois, the headquarters of
the defendant corporations. The Govern
ment officers argued that the land being
in the Northern District of California the
cases come properly before Judge Mc-
Kenna.
The case involves the title to large tracts
of valuable timber lands in the county
slated, and the corporations received
patents to the same from the Government
in 1894. The action is to rescind the grants
upon the ground tbat fraud was practiced
upon the Government in the Lund Office.
The case wilt be heard next month.

The Ship Centesima Had
to Be Run on the
Mud Flats.
Struck Sunday on the Potato
Patch When the Bar Was
Breaking.
Quite a Number of Vessels Are Bar
Bound in Coast Ports at
Present.
The British ship Centesima, that struct
on the Potato Patch last Saturday night,
was towed to Sausalito yesterday and run
on the mud flats. The damtfee wasfound
to be much greater than was at first sus
pected, and when it was discovered that
the vessel was making sixteen inches of
water an hour the captain thought it time
to run his ship ashore. The tugs Sea
King and Sea Queen were sent to ht>r as
sistance, and wmle Captain Rasmussen,
in the former, did the towing. Captain
Smith, in the Queen, remained alongside
and kept the pumps going. In this wwar3 r
the Centesima was taken to Richardson's
Bay, where she now lies only a lew hun
dred yards from the Sausalito ferry-boat.
The big shp has a cargo of over 4200
tons aboard, but none of it is perishable.
At Dundee she took aboard 2000 tons of
pigiron and considerable marble and other
goods. At Newcastle-on-Tyne she loaded
up with coke and then made the run her
in 145 days.
Pilot Freeman boarded her outside and
the tug Reliance put a line aboard outside
the whistling buoy. The bar was break
ing at the time and three heavy rollers
in succession struck the ship. The first
one threw her over, the second one put
her down on the patch and the third
raised her enough to give the tug a chance
to tow her clear. An examination shows
that the Centesima's deck beams are
broken and that nearly every plate in the
center of the ship has been started. The
cargo will be discharged into lighters and
then the vessel will go on the drydocK for
an overhauling.
The Pomona got in from Eureka yester
day after a very stormy passage. She
caught the full force ot the storm and
Captain Doran says that had it not been
for the steamer's powerful engines he
could never have made time.
The Czarina wa= to have sailed on Sun
day for the Beaver Hill colliery, but owing
to the state of ihe bar and the heavy
weather outside the captain made up his
mind to remain in port. He took the
steamer as far as the bar and then came'
back again. All of yesterday tha Czarina
lay at anchor and the chances are that she
will not go out until the gale Is over and
Coos Bay bar not dangerous. The steamer
has new boilers and new machinery in
parts. The repairs have never been thor
oughly tested, so her owners considered it
safer to keep her in port than to send her
out in a heavy southeaster, where she
would be helpless if anything gave way.
"Bob" Spear, the boatman, had a nar
row escape in yesterday's storm. He was
taking out some supplies to the Monad
nock when the wind took control of his
boat and swept him down to Lombard
street.
He was almost giving up in despair
when the tug Reliance came along and
took the Whitehall in tow. Spear was
landed on the warship about 10 a. m., but
it was late in the afternoon before he
would venture on the return trip.
The tug Rescue that took the barken
tine Geneva to Eureka has been caught
by the storm and is now bar-bound. Had
she arrived off the port two hours later
Captain Thompson could not have got his
tow in and would now be lacing a forty
five knot breeze.
The schooner Lizzie Prien and the tug
Tonquin are in a queer predicament in
Nehalem River. The latter was towing
the schooner out when she struck a snag
and not only broke her propeller shaft but
sustained considerable damage in the en
gines also. The Prien cannot get out over
the bar, and as the Tonquin is useless the
chances are that both vessels will remain
side by side until another tug can be sent
from San Francisco to tow one to sea and
the other to a place where repairs can be
made.
The steam schooner Alliance was tested
on the bay yesterday and proved herself
to be a fast boat and very steady in a sea
way. The chances are that she will be put
in the Coos Bay trade and carry coal and
passengers for Goodall, Perkins & Co.
The company has been seeking a suitable
boat ever since the wreck of the Arago
and the Alliance will probably be used
until a new vessel is built.
The E. K. Wood, beiore reported as
being overdue at Tientsin, has, according
to a private telegram,* arrived at that
point and sailed again on the 12th inst. for
Nagasaki.
The commission of officers selected by
the Secretary of the Navy to locate and
establish a naval training school on Goat
Island similar to the one at Newport,
R. 1., will meet to-day and come to some
decision. The board will consist of Cap
tain A. S. Baker of the Mare Island Navy
yard, Commander Frank Courtis, U. S. N.,
the lighthouse inspector of this port;
Major C. E. L. Davis, U. S. A., of the En
gineer Corps, and Lieutenant \V. S.
Hughes, U. S. N., of the hydrocraphic
office. Money for the work has been ap
propriated by Congress, and as soon as the
board decides upon the site the worK of
preparing quarters for the men and boys
will at once begin.
ACCEPT THE MEMORIAL.
Park Commissioners Formally Receive
the Ulysses S. Grant Monument
From the Association.
The following correspondence is self-ex
planatory :
Grant Monument Committee, )
San Francisco, December 0, 1896. j
To the Golden Gate Park Commissioners of the
City of San Fiancisco^-GESTLEMKs: The Grant
Monument Association, through its president
and secretary, desires to present to the Golden
Gate Park of the City of San Francisco, the
bust, pedestal, etc., of General Ulysses S.
Grant, now in place near the museum at the
Park.
This is the result of the contribution made
several years ago for a Grant monument. The
matter was dropped for many years and the
amount of money that had already been col
lected was put into the present shape as being
the most available.
While the monument Is not sufficient in mag
nitude to represent the wishes of the people of
San Francisco it is Â»he beet tbat could be done
with the amount of money available.
We, therefore, most respectfully ask you to
accept from the hands of the Grant monu
ment committee, in behalf of all the people,
this monument located in Golden Gate Park.
.Respectfully yours,
Grant Monument Committee.

INSANE MEN FIGHT.
A Chinese and a Xegro Tangle Up iv
the Waiting-Rooin of Judge
Hebbard's Court.
The deputy sheriff who officiates as bail
iff in Judge Hebbard's depaitment of the
Superior Court had an exciting time sepa
rating two infuriated insane persons who
were up for examination yesterday morn
ing. One of the unfortunates was a burly
negro named Gus Jemison and the other a
hollow-eyed Chinese named Choy Sam
Choy.
Trouble was brewing when they were
brought up together from the Receiving
Hospital. Jemison had tbe wild light of
the insane in his eyes, but he objected to
the company of the Celestial.
When they were placed in the waiting
room they glared at each other for a
while and then Jemison began making
hostile demonstrations.
After shaking his fist at Choy he sud
denly made a rush at him, and dropping
on bis knees before the Chinese, threw bis
fiats into a pugilistic pose and struck at
Choy. The latter was not opposed to bat
tle and they had just clinched for a good
rough and tumble fight when the deputy
came back to conduct them into court.
He lost no time in joining in *,he melee
ana after a hard tussle separated the pair
and held them at arm's length. Both
were committed to Stockton, but were
kept well apart until landed in the asylum.

"CIVILIZATION AND

Father Ferguson Lectures
in Metropolitan
Hall.
Successful Entertainment Held
Under the Auspices of
the Y. M. I.
The Lecturer Recounts the History
of Catholicism and Its Many
Triumphs Ov->r Persecution.
Metropolitan Hall was crowded last
night to hear Rev. Father James Ferguson
speak of "The Triumphs of Truth." This
lecture is the fourth of the Y. M. I. bureau
series, and was the principal though; not
the only feature of an attractive entertain
ment given under the auspicies of San
Francisco Council No. 7.
The genial chairman of the evening, E.
J. Oailagher, stated that these lectures
were the outcome of the efforts of an
earnest member at the last meeting of the
Grand Council. At this meeting their re
spected and well-beloved friend, the Rev.
Father Yorke [loud applause] proposed
the establishment of a lecture bureau for
the purpose of spreading Catholic truths
to the greatest extent possiDle, and of ac
quainting not only Protestant friends but
even" themselves with some of those
truths, This idea was subsequently re
alized and the present was the fourth of
the series of lectures delivered under the
auspices of the institute. The officers,
he added, felt confident that ere long these
lectures would become a positive neces
sity and a great educational factor.
Then followed the appended programme,
of which the cnotributions by the Sacred
Heart College Orchestra, under the leader
ship of Professor Karl Schernstein, and
the graceful fancy dancing ot the little
Misses Gertie and May O'Connor and their
brother Charles O'Connor,|were enthusias
tically received:
"King Cotton March" (Sousa), Sacred Heart
College Orchestra; "Old Homestead Gavotte"
(J. Zimmerman), Sacred Heart College Orches
tra; vocal solo, Miss Lulu Hilderbrandt; fancy
dancing, the Misses May and Gertie O'Connor;
grand selections, Campaign Melodies, Sacred
Heart College Orchestra; hornpipe and High
land fling, Master Charles O'Counor: comic
song, Richard I. Whelan; "Heather Rose Ca
price," selected, Sacred Heart College Orches
tra.
Rev. Father Ferguson on rising could
not prpceed for quite an interval, owing to
the applause. "Ladies and gentlemen."
he said, "one of the most successful busi
ness men in this country, in reply to tne
question how he succeeded in doing so
many difficult tnings, stated: 'I can wait
longer than any one else in the country
except the Roman Catholic church.'
[Loud applause.] He bad the capacity
tor biding his time, and understood that
everything comet to him who waits. He
discovered one reason why the Roman
Catholic church is successful. She waits.
She has passed triumphantly through per
secutions in almost every age of herex
istence, as impervious to them and to all
human vicissitudes as the pyramids which
stand amid the eternal sands of Egypt.
Kingdoms rise and fall, come and go; her
enemies disappear, but the church waits
on, and will continue to do so until her
Founder comes again to judee the quick
and the dead. If she were asked to prove
her truth by a miracle she might say that
her existence amid such long-continued
persecutions was miracle enough. Ex
amine history and we rind that at the time
the apostles Degan their mission the world
was politically organized into the Roman
empire, which as the consolidation of cen
turies was then in the splendor of its
meridian glory."
The speaker devoted many words of
eloquent description to the imperial city,
which, he said, was crowded with poets,
philosophers, painters, sculptors, as well
as with the ablest statesmen and the
bravest generals of that age. Into that
city a poor fisherman walked one day and
began to teach the new religion. At its
very inception the religion encountered
fierce opposition ; might tried to overcome
right. Peter was crucified and Paul be
headed. The Christians retired to the
catacombs and for 300 years the persecu
tion raged against the Nazarenes.
The lecturer described the devilish tor
tures to which the early martyrs were sub
jected, until in the reign of Diocletian it
was thought that the church had been
forever permanently crushed and a monu
ment was erected in the streets of Rome
to celebrate her extinction. But the i
Christians waited and ultimately the gods j
of the Pantheon fell broken from their
altars. The edicts of that mother church
were issued from that very city which had
witnessed her bitter persecution, out into
the universal world. But new trials
awaited her and had yet to be overcome.
Among these he spoke of the Arian heresy
of the fourth century and the terrific bar
barian inundations from the north and
east, before wnich the Roman legions
broke and melted away. The continent
was wasted from the Euphrates to the At
lantic; churches and monasteries, cities
and towns, institutions of learning, the
very arts of life, such as agriculture, en
gineering and architecture, perished.
The only ark of safety then was found
in the Catholic church, wnicb alone es
caped destruction. She linked the old
and new civilizations. If there had been
no Leo to check the "Scourge of God," as
Attila was called, imagination could not
picture the desolation which would have
obliterated every vestige of human genius.
The lecturer traced, also, the rise and de
cline of the Mohammedan power and its
defeat at the hands of Charles Martel and
John Sobieski, both soldiers of the
church.
Of tne reformation he said in part: "It
robbed the church of nearly half Northern
Europe, of half Germany and Great
Britain, where Catholicism was well-nigh
extirpated. Ireland alone remained faith
ful and loyal to Rome. But again she
waited, and we have seen how she has
again reconquered the countries from
which she was temporarily driven. 1 '
In this connection he quoted the famous
testimony of Lord Macaulay, of Matthew
Arnold and of Lecky to the wonderful de
velopment of the church and the unmis
takable evidences of her permanancy,
when, as the first-named said in an im
mortal passage contained in his essay on
"Ranke's History of the Popes," some
travelers from New Zealand shall take his
stand upon a broken arch of London
bridge and sketch the ruins of St. Paul's.
Whether we accept Samue! Johnson's defi
nition of civilization as an increasing pro
vision for the poor, or Ruskin's dictum
that art is its chief characteristic, the
Roman Catholic church must be accepted
as pre-eminent above all other factors
contributing thereto. Rome is the ob
jective point of all artists, and in music,
sculpture, painting, in all the refinements
of life that church has left masterpieces
for all time unapproachable for beauty,
sublimity and grandeur.
She established the earliest hospitals
universities, such as Cambridge, Oxford,
Glasgow, Louvain, Leipsic, Vienna, and
preserved the Greek and Latin classics for
future generations. Even an infidel like
the famous historian Gibbon, has affirmed
that one Benedictine foundation published
more scientific works than ail the educa
tional establishments of post-reformation
days.
